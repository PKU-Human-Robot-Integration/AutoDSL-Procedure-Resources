    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell culture\nTiming: 1–3 days, 15 min each day\nIn the next steps, the cell culture steps necessary for the preparation of senescence induction are described in detail.\nThaw and seed IMR90 cells in a 10 cm culture plate with 10 mL complete culture medium.\nIncubate the cells in a physiological O2 incubator for 1–3 days so that they reach approximately 90% confluence.\nDiscard the culture medium and briefly rinse the cells with 5–10 mL prewarmed 1× DPBS to remove all traces of serum that contains trypsin inhibitors.\nAdd 1 mL prewarmed trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) to the cells and hold at 37°C until cell layer is dispersed.\nNote: Generally, it takes 2–3 min to completely detach the cells by trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) but might take longer if one does not use fresh trypsin-EDTA.\nNeutralize trypsin-EDTA by adding 9 mL prewarmed complete culture medium and gently pipette 10 to 15 times to resuspend the cells. Check cell number using a cell counter.\nSeed the cells into 6-well culture plates at a density of 1.2 X 105 cells/well. Add complete culture medium to a final volume of 2 mL/well. Incubate the cells in a physiological O2 incubator for 16 h.\nCritical: Do not seed the cells at a density of more than 2 × 105 cells/well to avoid excessive cell confluence during senescence induction. Appropriate cell confluence is essential to achieve senescence-induced morphological changes (e.g., cellular hypertrophy).\nSenescence induction\nTiming: Overall timing for senescence induction: 7–10 days\nTiming:  <30 min (step 8)\nTiming: for changing culture medium <10 min (step 10)",
    "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most potent inducers of senescence (Gorgoulis et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Hernandez-Segura et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; McHugh and Gil, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]), generating a relatively homogenous group of senescent cells (Coppe et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Kang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Lee et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). In the next steps, the generation of DNA damage-induced senescent IMR90 cells is described in detail.\nCheck cell confluence to be approximately 10% before applying DNA damage (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/997-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Confluency of IMR90 cells before and after senescence induction\n(A) represents appropriate confluency (approximately 10%) to irradiate the cells for DNA damage-induced senescence.\n(B) represents cells that are too confluent for DNA damage-induced senescence; a sub-cultivation after irradiation is required in this case.\n(C) represents morphological changes including cellular hypertrophy upon senescence induction. The arrows indicate representative hypertrophic cells.\nScale bar, 300 μm.\nExpose the cells to a single ionizing radiation dose of 12 Gy with the GC3000 Elan irradiator (MDS Nordion, Canada).\nAlternatives: Systems other than the GC3000 Elan irradiator can be used for irradiation if they offer control on total dose. In this case, one should follow a designated protocol for each equipment to get a reproducible dose of irradiation. If radiological equipment is not available, DNA damage can be induced by treating the cells with bleomycin. Systems other than the GC3000 Elan irradiator can be used for irradiation if they offer control on total dose. In this case, one should follow a designated protocol for each equipment to get a reproducible dose of irradiation.\nCritical: normal (non-senescence-induced) cells should be maintained as a control.\n24 h after irradiation, replace culture medium with 2 mL fresh, prewarmed complete culture medium.\nEvery 3–4 days, replace exhausted culture medium with 2 mL fresh, prewarmed complete culture medium until the cells become senescent.",
    "Note: Generally, it takes 7–10 days after being irradiated for IMR90 cells to become fully senescent, based on the expression of multiple senescence markers, including Senescence-Associated Beta-Galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (e.g., p21 and p16), and Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) (Campisi et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Gorgoulis et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Hernandez-Segura et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; McHugh and Gil, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). The use of different cell lines may need adjustments and further assessment of markers for senescence to achieve full senescence as described in this protocol (Gonzalez-Gualda et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nCritical: If the cells become confluent (> 80%) at 2–4 days after irradiation, a sub-cultivation at the ratio of 1:2 is necessary for allowing the cells to display senescent phenotypes robustly, including senescent hypertrophy. When the cells already start to show senescent hypertrophy (generally, 4–5 days after irradiation), however, a sub-cultivation is not recommended as senescent cells are relatively sensitive to trypsinization. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nL-AHA incorporation and click chemistry\nTiming: 6–8 h\nTiming: 3 h for step 11–17\nTiming: 1–1.5 h for step 18–21\nTiming: 1–1.5 h for step 22–24\nL-AHA is a non-radioactive and non-toxic amino acid analog of methionine that contains an azido moiety, allowing its quantitative detection through the chemoselective ligation (“click chemistry”) between an azide and a fluorescent alkyne (Kolb et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). L-AHA can be incorporated into the newly synthesized proteins in mammalian cells; thus, it can be utilized for measuring the rate of global protein synthesis (Dieterich et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Imami and Yasuda, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Tom Dieck et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). In the following steps, we describe how to measure incorporation of L-AHA into the newly synthesized proteins in senescent cells compared to that in normal (non-senescence-induced) cells using three different treatment conditions: (a) L-AHA; (b) L-AHA + cycloheximide (CHX); and (c) ddH2O (“unstained control”).",
    "Replace complete culture medium with 1 mL prewarmed methionine-free medium to deplete methionine in normal and senescent IMR90 cells and incubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nNote: This step could be omitted if nutritional stress needs to be considered; however, in this case, L-AHA labeling time may need to be increased accordingly. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nPrepare fresh L-AHA working solution by diluting the stock solution in prewarmed methionine-free medium (100 μM final concentration).\nNote: L-AHA working solution needs to be prepared fresh for every experiment. We also recommend testing and determining the optimal concentration of L-AHA for your experimental conditions (e.g., cell line, treatment). Generally, 25–100 μM L-AHA is used for measuring the global protein synthesis rate in mammalian cells (Herranz et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Lee et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]; Zhang et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nLabel cells with 1 mL 100 μM L-AHA for 30 min at 37°C. Treatment with CHX (100 μg/mL) that interferes with the translocation step in protein synthesis can be used as a negative control (Schneider-Poetsch et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). In addition, prepare cells that are not labeled with L-AHA (ddH2O treated, unstained control) as an additional negative control for assessing a non-specific signal from unconjugated AFDye 405 alkyne.\nDiscard the L-AHA culture medium and briefly rinse cells with 1–2 mL prewarmed 1× DPBS per well to remove all traces of serum.\nAdd 250 μL prewarmed trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) to cells and hold at 37°C for 2–3 min until cell layer is dispersed.\nAdd 750 μL prewarmed methionine-free medium to cells and gently pipette 10 to 15 times to resuspend cells.\nCollect cell suspension in U-bottom FACS tubes and centrifuge at 300 × g, 4°C for 5 min. Discard supernatants.",
    "Note: Do not use higher × g for centrifugation to avoid cell damage and clumping. From this step, we recommend using a U-bottom FACS tube instead of an Eppendorf tube to reduce cell loss during the procedure of click chemistry as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/997-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A comparison of cell loss during the click chemistry in Eppendorf and U-bottom FACS tubes\nUsing U-bottom FACS tubes for the click chemistry reduces cell loss during the click chemistry compared to using Eppendorf tubes. Red circle and arrow indicate cell pellet collected by centrifugation.\nWash cells with cold 1× DPBS: resuspend cells in 1 mL cold 1× DBPS per tube; centrifuge at 300 × g, 4°C for 5 min; and discard supernatants.\nFix cells with paraformaldehyde: resuspend cells in 200 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v in DPBS) per tube; incubate cells for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C); centrifuge at 800 × g, 4°C for 10 min; and gently discard supernatants by pipetting.\nNote: Optimal fixation conditions may vary with cell type.\nCritical: After fixation, the cell pellet tends to get loose easily. Thus, caution is needed from this step. For example, we recommend slightly tilting a U-bottom FACS tube and pipetting slowly, not aspirating, to remove supernatants during the washing step. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nPermeabilize cells with the permeabilization buffer: resuspend cells in 200 μL of permeabilization buffer (1× Triton X-100 [0.5%]) per tube; incubate cells for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C); centrifuge at 800 × g, 4°C for 10 min; and gently discard supernatants by pipetting.\nPrepare the L-AHA click reaction cocktail as described in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nCritical: The L-AHA click reaction cocktail must be prepared fresh and used immediately at each experiment. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]",
    "Add 200 μL L-AHA click reaction solution per tube. Resuspend the cell pellet and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C). Make sure to protect the sample from light (e.g., wrap sample tubes with aluminum foil when not in use) during the following steps.\nWash cells twice with 1% BSA in 1× DPBS: resuspend cells in with 500 μL 1% BSA in 1× DPBS per tube; centrifuge at 800 × g, 4°C for 10 min; gently discard supernatants by pipetting; and repeat this washing step once more.\nNote: Washing cells with 1% BSA is for blocking non-specific staining and reducing cell aggregation.\nResuspend cells in 500 μL 1% FBS in 1× DBPS. Place all tubes on ice in the dark.\nFlow cytometry and quantitative analysis\nTiming: 1–2 h\nIn the next steps, flow cytometry analysis including drawing gates for senescent cells and measuring the median fluorescence of L-AHA incorporation is described in detail. Turn on the Attune NxT Acoustic Focusing Cytometer.\nAlternatives: Other cytometers are likely suitable for this application once they provide a proper filter/laser setting for detecting AFdye405 (e.g., laser 405, filter 440/50).\nUsing the control unstained samples, draw the gate by the forward (FSC-A) and side scatter profiling (SSC-A) that defines the main live cell population, excluding cellular debris and dead cells with the Attune Nxt Software (v3.1.2) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/997-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of flow cytometry gating strategy for the live cell population in senescent cells",
    "Graph displaying all events detected by flow cytometry (left). Gates drawn to isolate debris and live cell populations. Graph displaying the levels of L-AHA incorporation in a selected population (right). Debris 1 and 2 populations show no L-AHA incorporation; Debris 3 population includes both ‘unstained’ debris and ‘stained’ live cells. The majority of the live population is positive for L-AHA incorporation.\nCritical: Senescent cells exhibit significant morphological changes, such as cellular hypertrophy and increased granularity (Gorgoulis et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Hernandez-Segura et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; McHugh and Gil, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). Furthermore, senescent samples tend to have a higher level of cell debris than control samples. Thus, we recommend adjusting the gate for the live cell population that excludes cell debris in senescent samples as much as possible while not significantly depleting live cells in control samples. As cell debris is negative for L-AHA staining, one can exclude the population completely negative for L-AHA staining as cell debris as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nFor the live cell population gated in step 25, record L-AHA incorporation (AFdye405) for at least 10,000 events.\nNote: As senescent cells are larger than control cells in size, the number of senescent cells recorded for L-AHA incorporation by FACS is less than that of normal cells if the same volume of samples is analyzed. In general, the number of senescent cells is about 70–85% less than that of normal cells.\nQuantify L-AHA incorporation by measuring the median value of fluorescence with FlowJo software. Check whether both unstained samples and negative controls (samples treated with CHX) display a minimal level of L-AHA incorporation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/997-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Quantification of the L-AHA incorporation in normal and senescent cells\n(A) L-AHA incorporation is measured by FACS. CHX denotes cycloheximide.",

Select “Median” (or any desired statistics) for the channel recording L-AHA incorporation (AFdye405) and click “Add”.\nApply the median statistics to all samples by dragging the “Median” icon in the list to the “live” icon under all samples.\nExport the file in excel format."
