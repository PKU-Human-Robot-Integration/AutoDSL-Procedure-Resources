    "All of the following surgical and animal care procedures have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Temple University.\n1. Pre-surgical preparations\nPrepare pulled glass needles for viral injection a few days before surgery using 3.5 nanoliter glass capillary pipettes designed for nanoliter injectors. Pull each pipette on a two-step needle puller according to the manufacturer’s instructions to create two needle templates.\nRefine the tip of the needle templates by cutting off approximately 1-2 mm of excess glass with microscissors. Measure approximate aperture size under a microscope with a microscope calibration slide to isolate needles with 30-40 µm apertures.\nWith the needle positioned at 30°, use a micropipette beveller to create a tip with a 30-40 µm aperture and a 45° beveled angle. Verify aperture width with the Vernier scale on the calibration slide. Pass water and ethanol through the glass needle using a syringe with a flexible needle attachment to wash away debris and mark the needle at regular intervals with a black marker.\nPlace the needles in a covered Petri dish previously cleaned with 70% ethanol and sterilize for 30 min in a Biosafety hood under UV light.\nPrepare HiRet lentivirus by removing a suitable volume from the freezer immediately prior to the procedure.\n\tNOTE: A suitable volume includes the amount needed for injection (1 µL per injection x number of injections) plus a small amount of extra volume to account for pipetting and loading losses. Transport and store the virus on ice when not in use.\nPrepare the injector by plugging it into the micropump and placing it into a micromanipulator with a Vernier scale.",
    "To prepare the glass needle, carefully load a colored dye such as red oil with a syringe outfitted with a flexible needle. Ensure that no bubbles remain in the needle. Use aseptic technique when handling the needle, and refrain from touching the tip.\nInsert the glass needle into the injector, ensuring that the needle is seated correctly into the washers, the injector cap is screwed on tight, and the steel injector needle is extended approximately ¾ the length of the glass needle. Virus can be loaded into the needle in a later step.\n2. Anesthesia and surgical site preparation\nWeigh the animal on a digital scale. Record the pre-operative weight to determine the volume of anesthetic required and to allow for monitoring of weight post-surgery. Female Sprague-Dawley rats approximately 200–250 g were used in this protocol.\nAnesthetize the rat using either isoflurane inhalation or an injected ketamine/xylazine solution (k/x). Here, ketamine is injected intraperitoneally at a 67 mg/kg and xylazine at a 6.7 mg/kg dosage.\nConfirm an appropriate anesthetic plane by pinching the foot firmly. If reflexive withdrawal occurs, wait several additional minutes before proceeding.\n\tNOTE: Also observe the whiskers, eyes and breathing rate for signs of consciousness. If the whiskers are twitching, the eye blinks when touched gently, or breathing is rapid and shallow, wait until the anesthetic plane is deeper to proceed with the protocol. Also monitor these signs throughout the laminectomy and injection surgery. If the animal displays a shallow anesthetic plane, administer a booster shot of ketamine-only equal to ½ the original k/x dosage.\nShave the rat along the dorsal midline from the hips to the inferior angle of the scapulae. Pull the skin of the animal taut for an easier and more precise shave.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes.",
    "Apply antiseptic to the shaved area to sterilize the site. For the first scrub, soak sterile gauze with a 5% iodine solution and wipe away all hair and debris. Follow this with a unidirectional swipe with sterile gauze soaked in 70% ethanol, so that no area is contacted twice. Use this same technique with alternating iodine and ethanol-soaked gauze twice more.\n3. Surgical field and instrument preparation\nPrepare a set of autoclaved surgical tools that include a scalpel, rongeurs, rat tooth forceps, spring scissors, hemostats, medium point curved forceps and retractors or weighted hooks by unwrapping the sterile wrap to create a sterile field.\nOpen a package of sterile surgical gloves and place the sterile glove wrap on the table. Use this as an additional sterile field for used tools to prevent contamination of the sterile wrap.\nDrop a #10 scalpel blade onto the sterile field. Secure the blade to a handle with hemostats. Position sterile saline, 4.0 chromic catgut suture, and materials to control bleeding such as a cauterizer, sterile gauze, sterile cotton-tipped applicators (for muscle bleeds), or gelfoam or bonewax (for bone bleeds) in an accessible place.\nRetrieve the animal and set it on a sterile cloth. Place gauze underneath the bladder to collect urine. Prop up the target area with a rolled towel under the abdomen. If available, place a surgical heating pad underneath the sterile cloth, especially for longer procedures.\n\tNOTE: Sterility is important during survival surgery. Keep a spray bottle of 70% ethanol on hand to maintain sterility of gloved hands, and a use bead sterilizer if instrument sterility is compromised, or between individual surgeries.\n4. Exposing the vertebral column and identifying the laminectomy site",
    "Identify the area where a skin incision will be made by pressing the fingers gently at the last rib to locate the L1 vertebra. Using this as a landmark, make a 3-4 cm skin incision with a #10 surgical scalpel ending just inferior to L1 to expose the muscle. Hold the skin taut by gentle spreading and press firmly with the scalpel blade to ensure a clean incision.\nCut and spread superficial fat with forceps and scissors if necessary. (Depending on target vertebra, there may or not be a large fat pad superficial to the muscle). \nFeel for the spinous processes with the flat of the scalpel blade or a finger. Often the midline area will be outlined by a “V” of white fascia on either side. Make a small rostral cut to allow room to grab securely onto an upper process with rat tooth forceps, then make 2 long, deep cuts as close to the processes as possible. At the deepest point of the cut, the dorsal surface of the vertebrae can be felt with the scalpel blade.\nHold the lateral muscles aside with retractors or weighted hooks to improve visibility. Clear muscle around the processes with a scalpel, spring scissors or rongeurs to determine the shape of their heads.\n\tNOTE: Remember that the spinal cord does not extend the full length of the vertebral column, as spinal cord tissue stops growing earlier in development than bone. This means that the target spinal level may be underneath a differently named vertebra.\nLocate the T11 and the adjoining T12 and T13 processes.",
    "NOTE: Assistance in targeting correct vertebral levels can be found in a rat spinal cord atlas and previous studies outlining landmarks in the mouse, which has a very similar vertebral structure6,33. Leave a rostral spinous process such as T9 undisturbed to give a midline landmark.\n5. Performing a laminectomy\nOnce the target area has been correctly identified, perform laminectomies of the dorsal aspects of T11-T13. Gently spread the vertebrae to reveal intervertebral ligaments, which are good sites to insert rongeurs for the initial bite of bone. Hold the rongeurs in a half-closed position to increase fine control.\nRemove the spinous processes and the dorsal aspect of the vertebrae by taking small bites with the rongeurs. Be careful not to damage the spinal cord or disturb the dura. Lift slightly with the rat tooth forceps to help pull the spinal cord away from the vertebrae and decrease the tendency to hit spinal cord tissue.\nClear bone away from the midline so that the midline blood vessel can be observed. Leave a window that clearly shows the spinal cord tissue and is free of debris.\nGently touch the spinal cord with forceps. Some animals may reflexively jump even if their anesthetic plane is deep. Apply a few drops of a numbing agent such as lidocaine directly to the spinal cord to prevent jumping during the injection procedure.\nSecure the animal in a spinal holder by fastening stabilizing forceps to spinous processes rostral and caudal to the laminectomy window. Raise the abdomen of the animal using the spinal holder to negate the effect of breathing movements. This will increase needle stability and ensure appropriate depth of injection.\n6. Loading virus and positioning the injector",
    "Load virus into the injector by pipetting approximately 5 µL onto a piece of parafilm and positioning the needle so that the tip is inside the drop.\nUse the micropump to withdraw up to 4 µL of virus at a rate of 20–100 nL/s.\nSet the controller to inject and release a small amount of virus from the needle to ensure the tip of the needle is not blocked. Wipe off excess virus with a laboratory wipe.\n\tNOTE: A Hamilton syringe with a steel needle may be used as an alternative to pulled glass pipettes.\nPosition the micromanipulator so that the Vernier scale is visible and position the needle at the midline of the spinal cord.\n\tNOTE: The midline can sometimes be located by a large blood vessel running on the anterior surface of the spinal cord. However, this can vary in individual rats, and midline targeting should be confirmed by comparison with an intact spinous process.\nDirect the needle laterally by 0.8 mm using the Vernier scale on the micromanipulator.\nLower the needle to the spinal cord until it is indenting, but not puncturing, the dura. Using a quick twisting motion, puncture the dura with the needle until it has sunk to a depth of 1.5 mm.\n7. Injecting virus into the spinal cord\nOnce the needle is in place, program the injector to inject at a rate of 400 nL/min. Confirm that virus is entering the spinal cord by observing the progress of the dye front. There should be no obvious leakage or bulging of spinal cord tissue. If leakage is observed, this can sometimes be alleviated by reducing the injection speed to 200 nL/min.",
    "Once the injection is finished, allow the needle to rest in the spinal cord for 2–5 min (depending on volume injected) to facilitate diffusion of the virus.\nSlowly withdraw the needle and move to the next injection site. Inject 1 µL of virus into each of 6 evenly spaced sites approximately 1 mm apart along the length of the L1-L4 spinal tissue. The same needle may be used for each injection as long as it continues to function properly.\n8. Wound closure and post-operative care\nRemove the animal from the spinal holder and take out retractors or hooks used to spread lateral muscle. Ensure that the wound is clear of all debris before closing.\nSuture the muscle using a 4.0 chromic catgut suture. Cut suture threads close to the knot to reduce likelihood of internal skin irritation.\nStaple the skin closed using 9 mm wound clips. To allow for optimal healing, line up the edges of the skin before stapling.\nPlace the animal on a water convection warming pad and monitor until wakeful.\nInject 5–10 mL of sterile saline subcutaneously to replenish fluids and an antibiotic such as cefazolin to prevent infection. When the animal is ambulatory, place it back in its home cage and provide initial analgesics.  Monitor the rats for any sign of pain and distress and treat according to your IACUC approved procedure for alleviation of pain.\nSubscription Required.
