    "This Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0001] is intended as a first contact with the BioGateway Cytoscape app, focusing on the use of the Human data. As data for several additional species is now being added to the BioGateway triple store, the protocols also can be used for other taxa, with the exception of steps that involve relationships of transcription factors and their target genes. Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0001] explains how to import one node into an empty Cytoscape canvas, explore the available information for that node, and use it to create a small protein-protein interaction network together with Gene Ontology annotations. The protocol illustrates the exploration of RASK (UNIPROT ID: P01116), a protein with an important role in regulation of cell proliferation. The protocol will start by importing a node representing the protein RASK and the gene coding for it, followed by the identification of all proteins interacting with RASK and the GO Biological Processes that RASK is involved in.\nBefore starting, it is important to note that (1) BioGateway does differentiate between proteins and genes, and treats them as separate entities that require specific queries; and, (2) for reasons of accuracy, the naming of nodes representing proteins (boxes) and genes (ovals) always uses the GENE name. Because every gene encodes many different protein isoforms, we have chosen to treat the main entity protein as a “bag” representing all isoforms that may exist for that protein, and name that “bag” with the name of its gene.\nThus, the aim of this protocol is to show users how to import nodes of interest (protein, gene, Gene Ontology term, etc.) into the Cytoscape canvas and find the relations going to/from that node and its neighbors.\nNecessary Resources\nHardware",
    "This protocol requires users to have an up-to-date Macintosh, Unix/Linux, or Windows computer capable of running Cytoscape version 3.0 or later (https://cytoscape.org/manual/Cytoscape2_8Manual.html#System%20requirements[href=https://cytoscape.org/manual/Cytoscape2_8Manual.html#System%20requirements]). Finally, it is necessary to have a stable broadband connection to the Internet in order to smoothly execute the protocols.\nSoftware\nCytoscape and the BioGateway Cytoscape plugin are required to follow this protocol. The Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0006] describes how to download and install the required software. During the writing of this protocol, version 3.8.0 of Cytoscape and version 3.2.2 of the BioGateway plugin were used. However, the users can follow this protocol by installing the latest versions of both Cytoscape and the BioGateway plugin.\n1. Launch Cytoscape, and create an empty network (File > New Network > Empty). Name your network “Network 1.”\n2. Open the BioGateway configuration panel by clicking on the BioGateway tab in the Cytoscape control panel, expand the Active Taxa selection, and make sure that only the taxon Homo sapiens is activated (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cf81dc0b-0732-4fed-95da-f2008a85a46c/cpbi106-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nThe BioGateway Tab in the Cytoscape Control Panel showing some of the possible Active Properties to use when querying. The Active Taxa tree allows users to select what taxa they want to work with.\n3. Right click anywhere in the empty Cytoscape canvas and select in the pop-up window the option BioGateway. Next, click Add BioGateway node (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/81eff77c-7682-4ee3-903d-03ac4c6daec3/cpbi106-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nThe BioGateway menu displayed when right clicking anywhere on the Cytoscape Canvas.\n4. This will open the BioGateway Node Lookup dialog box, where the user can search for the name of a protein, gene, GO term, taxon, or disease of interest. The default name to search for is set to “Protein.” Enter “RASK” in the query box and click the Search button.",
    "If multiple species are active, the search will produce more results, and the search time may accordingly be longer.\n5. The result will be shown in the Results Panel of the dialog. Select the protein of interest and import by clicking the Use Selected Node button (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/39402e45-ba11-493a-abce-ccf93349f621/cpbi106-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nThe Query Result window after looking for the protein “RASK.”\n6. The Cytoscape canvas will now contain a square-shaped node representing the RASK protein. As noted above, it is important to remember that BioGateway treats genes and proteins as different entities. To illustrate the information that BioGateway has about this node, right click on the KRAS node, select BioGateway Fetch relations TO node, and observe several options: Search for all relation types, molecularly interacts with, and encodes. For each, the origin of the relationship is indicated. Select the option Search for all relation types (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0004]). This will query the BioGateway server for all relationships that include the protein RASK as target node.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fc9c6f51-b065-4b10-bc9e-ecd7bad23df8/cpbi106-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nThe BioGateway menu displayed when right-clicking on a BioGateway node in the Cytoscape Canvas.",
    "7. A dialog will open showing the results of the query launched in step 6. There are many different relation types returned, and they can be sorted by clicking on the column header relation type. Alternatively, by typing a search string in the Filter results box, the results will be limited to those matching the typed characters. By highlighting one or more types of relationships (in one or more steps), the desired relationships can be imported to a network by clicking the Import Selected button. First select first all relationships of the type “encodes,” and import to the canvas by clicking Import Selected (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0005]). Next, select all relationships of the type “molecularly interacts with” and “involved in,” and import. Notice that all new nodes are superimposed in the canvas (because of a Cytoscape “feature”), and press F5 to prompt Cytoscape to render a deconvoluted network (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0005]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/20c35b64-98b7-40ae-a702-f121b33399b9/cpbi106-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nFinding all relationships leading to the selected node, filtering results, and importing them. (A) The Query Result window after filtering the results containing “encodes” in any of the fields. (B) The resulting network after importing the results shown in (A). BioGateway displays proteins and genes as separate entities, where square-shaped nodes represent protein nodes and oval-shaped nodes represent genes.",
    "8. Note that alternatively you can select the “molecularly interacts with” relationships for RASK, involving Protein− Interactions (PPIs) that RASK is involved in, by right clicking on the KRAS protein node and selecting the option BioGateway > Fetch relations FROM node > IntAct: molecularly interacts with. This will query the BioGateway server for all PPIs that include RASK (note that the same results will be obtained when clicking Fetch relations TO node, as PPIs do not have a direction). Likewise, the “involved in” relationships can be found by BioGateway > Fetch relations FROM node > GOA: involved in, which fetches all GOA annotations with biological process terms, for RASK. For these two separate queries, a dialog will open; select all relations and import them by clicking the Import Selected button.\n9. Observe that the network around the RASK protein now has diamond-shaped nodes with GO term names for biological process terms and box-shaped nodes representing proteins that the RASK protein is connected to (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0006]). The information about these nodes is shown in the Cytoscape node table; the information about the relationships can be seen in the edge table. This network can now be further extended either by right-clicking any of the nodes in this network and launching new searches as above, or by using the query builder (see below).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d114a1bc-ef2b-46d0-90c7-dffc3a733a1d/cpbi106-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nThe resulting network showing proteins as square-shaped nodes, genes as oval-shaped nodes, and GO terms as diamond-shaped nodes.",
    "This protocol builds on Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0001] and shows users how to produce the same network as above by using the Query Builder. After replicating these results some additional information will be added to the network, introducing the user to the building of queries that can be specified further in a step-by-step mode using multiple query lines. This approach allows a user either to broaden a network or to further select the network results by specifying additional criteria that the results should comply with. The protocol also shows the power of using identifiable wildcards to find the intersection between several query results.\nThe Query Builder is one of the most important ways of interacting with the BioGateway repository. It allows the creation of complex queries in an intuitive manner by “stacking” desired criteria. Every single criterion is represented as a line in the Query Builder, where each line is a statement that constitutes a Subject-Relationship-Object structure (similar to RDF). Figure 7A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0007] shows the Query Builder, where the three top fields marked in red represent the Subject, the Relationship, and the Object. Both the Subject and the Object box have the same setting options (Fig. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0007]). From left to right, these are:\n         \n1.Entity or Set: To specify if the node to use as Subject/Object will be a specific named entity (e.g., Protein, Gene, Gene Ontology term, etc.,) or a set (wildcard).\n2.Entity type: To define if the Subject/Object is a protein, gene, GO term, or Disease. The remaining terms will not be used in the use cases covered in this protocol.\n3.Entity name: To insert the desired protein, gene, etc. As shown in Figure 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0007], an autocomplete function is started when the user starts typing in the text of interest.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1578ade7-5589-4f25-9a07-f5aedc5b02af/cpbi106-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7",
    "The BioGateway Query Builder. (A) The Query Builder Window: red boxes indicate the Subject, Relation, Object, and Autocomplete results. (B) Closer detail of the Subject part of the Query Builder after typing “TP5”: typing text into the search field triggers the autocomplete function, which provides all matches with the introduced text. Note that the Subject and the Object have the same structure. (C) Closer detail of the Relation part of the Query Builder: a drop-down menu allows the users to select the desired relation type.\nThe Relation (Fig. 7C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0007]) states the type of relationship to search for between the Subject and the Object. The possible relationships are TF-TG interactions, protein-protein Interactions (PPIs), gene encoding for a protein, Gene Ontology Annotations (GOAs), involvement in a disease, and orthology. The app provides user support to flag queries that do not make sense: for instance, if the query aims to fetch relationships between a transcription factor (by definition a protein) and a gene, the entity types that do not match the query will be shown in red.\nNecessary Resources\nSee Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0001]\n1. Introduce a new network in Cytoscape (File > New Network > Empty), and name it “Network 2.”\n2. Select the Biogateway Control Panel and open the Query Builder (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0008]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5f825803-a1d3-4b2a-a6e3-053828c0ee9f/cpbi106-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nOpening the BioGateway Query Builder from the BioGateway Tab in the Cytoscape Control Panel.",
    "3. This will open the Query Builder box that allows the user to compose queries line by line, by specifying a first entity type [either a specific one or a group (e.g., Set A)]; a relation type (to be chosen from a drop-down list); and a second entity (again either a specific one or a Set). After each query line, the results can be observed by pressing the Run Query button at the bottom of the query box. Based on the volume and details of the results, the user may decide either to apply additional selections in a next query line, by mentioning the same entities of sets, or add additional network information by defining new entities or sets.\n4. The first entity is by default “protein,” and typing RASK in the box next to it will launch the autocomplete function. Note that with each character the autocomplete matches become more specific. Select the autocomplete suggestion: KRAS: KRAS2, RASK2, RASK_HUMAN, P01116−Homo Sapiens–GTPase KRas. Note that the autocomplete function returns multiple gene names (KRAS, KRAS2, RASK2) as it supports synonym searches, and that for the protein the UniProt identifier (RASK_HUMAN) and UniProt accession number (P01116) are provided.\n5. The default relationship is set to “IntAct: molecularly interacts with,” so this can be left as is.\n6. Define the entity that RASK should interact with, by selecting “Set A.” This query line will now search for all protein-protein interactions that include the RASK protein. Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0009] shows the Query Builder after building the query defined so far.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/49e4d363-353a-481b-8a91-77d8c533942d/cpbi106-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nThe Query Builder with a one-line query asking for all proteins interacting with RASK.\n7.

    "The Query Result Tab after launching a query through the Query Builder.\n8. Next, go back to the Query Builder interface by clicking the Build Query button, and press Add Line (bottom of pane). Set the relation type to “GOA: involved in,” and again specify the KRAS protein as first entity. Select “Set B” as the second entity, specifying the query to fetch all GOA biological process annotations for KRAS.\n9. Add one more query line to fetch the gene encoding the RASK protein: specify “gene” as first entity, and allow for multiple hits (Set C). Select “protein” as second entity, specify “RASK,” and select the RASK protein from the autocomplete result. Note that the gene needs to be specified first, as the “encodes” relationship has the TO direction (Fig. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0011]). Your query is now identical to the selection steps performed in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0001]. Click Run Query, select all the results and Import to selected Network.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/68354afe-0d0c-4f0d-9e85-007efed2605d/cpbi106-fig-0011-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 11\nThe Query Builder showing the query that will yield the same network as Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0001].\n10. Cytoscape now has two networks, comparison will show that Network 1 is identical to Network 2 (Fig. 12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0012]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/dfc8daf4-0228-4a45-bacd-839bea3ccda7/cpbi106-fig-0012-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 12\nThe network obtained through the Query Builder is the same as the one obtained in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0001].\n11. We will now refine the network by limiting the results to RASK interacting proteins that have the same biological process annotations as KRAS. Add a new query line, specify “Set A,” set the relationship to “GOA: involved in,” and specify the GO term as “Set B.” Run the query and observe that the number of relationships has now significantly dropped. Select all results and click Import to new Network.",
    "12. The new network (Fig. 13[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0013]) has only 25% of the nodes and half of the relationships, specifying a protein-protein interaction network around the RASK protein in which all pairs of interactors share the same biological process annotations.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/535e6b2d-0292-4fcc-a76d-bed7154844db/cpbi106-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13\nThe resulting network after adding extra lines in the Query Builder.\n13. In a last step, we will fetch the genes for all the proteins in the network and select transcription factors that regulate them. Because there will be many TFs, we will select only those that regulate both the RASK gene and one of the other genes, and we further select them to share the same annotations as the proteins in the network. The steps to do this are:\n         \nFetch the genes coding for the proteins in set A: add a new query line and set the Subject Entity to “Set D” and its entity type to Gene. Next, set the relation type to “encodes,” and set the Object to “Set A” and its Entity type to Protein.\nFetch the transcription factors regulating Set D: add a new query line and set the Subject Entity to “Set E” and its Entity type to Protein. Now, set the relation type to “involved in regulation of” and set the Object Entity to “Set D” and its Entity Type to Gene.\nFetch the transcription factors regulating the RASK gene (which is not a member of set A!): add a new query line and set the Subject Entity to “Set E” and its Entity type to Protein. Next, select the relation type to “involved in regulation of.” Finally, set the Object Entity to “RASK” and its entity type to Gene.",
    "Limit set E to TFs with annotations shared by PPI pairs: add a new query line and select “Set E” in the Subject Entity and Protein as its Entity type. Next, select “involved in” as the relation type, select “Set B” as the Object Entity, and set “GO term” as its Entity type.

In addition to the RASK protein, it contains other TFs interacting with it, the genes whose transcription they regulate, and the proteins encoded by these genes (Fig. 15[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0015]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/40250b72-9dae-4dd0-86b6-a5f5deb559bf/cpbi106-fig-0015-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 15\nThe resulting network with proteins interacting with RASK, the genes whose expression they regulate, the proteins encoding by these genes, and the GO Biological Process terms.",
    "This protocol will take users deeper into building queries through the BioGateway Query Builder by constructing a multiline query. The overarching biological questions will be “What are some proteins that are relevant in both Breast and Colorectal Cancer? What Transcription Factors regulate the expression of the genes coding for these proteins?”. Through this, we will also introduce the users to the UniProt Disease graph, which stores annotations of proteins and their roles in different diseases. Thus, in this protocol, users will learn to create a network that satisfies several criteria in one query. The protocol will start from the Query Builder dialog.

    "In this protocol, we will explore an advanced feature from the Query Builder that allows the users to Filter the results of their query and create a subnetwork from the filtered results. Through this, users can create wider queries, which will then be explored and curated in the Query Result window. The biological questions in this case are “What are the potential downstream effects after targeted inhibition of MAP3K7 and AKT1? Can we find a connection between the two affected proteins?.” To answer these questions, the protocol will start with the creation of a 5-line query on the Query Builder. Once getting the results, users will be guided through a series of steps to learn how to curate the results based on a text search and create a subnetwork based on the filtering.\nNecessary Resources\nSee Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0001]\n1. Build a query line asking for the proteins interacting with MAP3K7: type “MAP3K7” in the Subject search field and select the first result from the autocomplete results. Next, set the relation type to “molecularly interacts with” and the Object to “Set A.”\n2. Add a new line asking for the proteins interacting with AKT1 from the set of proteins found in step 1: add a new query line and type “AKT1” in the search field for the Subject. Select the first result from the autocomplete function and set the relation type to “molecularly interacts with.” Now, set the Object to “Set A.”\n3. Add a new line querying for the TGs of the TFs found in lines 1 and 2 of the query: add a new query line and set the Subject to “Set A.” Now, set the relation type to “involved in regulation of” and the Object to “Set B.”",
    "4. Add a new line in order to get the proteins encoded by the genes found in step 3: add a new query line and set the Subject to “Set B.” Next, set the relation type to “encodes” and the Object to “Set C.”\n5. Add a new line to find the GO Biological Process annotations for the proteins found in step 4: add a query line. Set the Subject to “Set C” and the relation type to “involved in.” Finally, set the Object to “Set D.” Figure 21[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-fig-0021] shows the Query Builder window after building the described query.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c2483bb4-2003-46a3-beb2-e13436549c49/cpbi106-fig-0021-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 21\nThe Query Builder after building the query described in Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.106#cpbi106-prot-0005].\n6.
