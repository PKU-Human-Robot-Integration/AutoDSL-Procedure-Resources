    "All procedures have been approved by the appropriate research ethics committee at Yonsei University College of Medicine. All experimental animals are sacrificed in accordance with the guidelines of the laboratory animal care committee at Yonsei University College of Medicine.\n1. Preparation of Reagents\nCaution: Paraformaldehyde (PFA), acrylamide and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) are toxic irritants and thus should be handled in a fume hood with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE; lab coat, gloves, protective eyewear).\n4% acrylamide (A.A) solution (A4P0): Add 20 mL of 40% acrylamide solution to 180 mL of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n0.25% VA-044 solution: Add 0.5 g of 2,2´-Azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)propane] dihydrochloride (VA-044) powder to 200 mL of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). While the VA-044 powder can be stored at room temperature, it must be stored at 4 °C upon solubilization in PBS. For best results, prepare only the amount of solution needed for the experiment.\nPACT cocktail solution: Add 10 g of acrylamide to 225 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution and adjust the volume to 200 mL with 4% PFA. Prior to use, add 100 mg of VA-044 powder to 40 mL of mixture in a 50 mL conical tube.\nPACT clearing solution buffer: Add 40 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to 350 mL of 0.1 M PBS and adjust the volume to 500 mL with 0.1 M PBS. For mPACT clearing solution, add 0.5% α-thioglycerol to the PACT clearing solution buffer.\nThe mice used in this study were 2-week-old BALB male mice; the rats used in this study were 2 week old male SD-rats.\n2. Anesthesia and Perfusion Surgery\nCaution: PFA and acrylamide are toxic irritants and thus should be handled in a fume hood with appropriate PPE.",
    "Anesthetize the animal in a pathogen-free room with 30 mg/kg of zoletil using a 1 mL syringe with a 26-gauge needle. Monitor the animal for 5 -10 min.\nOnce the animal has reached a surgical plane of anesthesia, use the toe-pinch response method to determine the depth of anesthesia. Confirm unresponsiveness.\n\tNOTE: The following steps involving mouse and rat surgery follow a similar protocol used in a previous study11.\nMake a 5-6 cm incision beneath the rib cage, through the integument and abdominal wall.\nUse curved, blunt scissors to make an incision in the diaphragm, palpating the thoracic area to locate the site of incision beforehand.\nExtend the incision across the entire length of the ribcage to expose the pleural cavity.\nCarefully displace the lungs. Make a cut through the ribcage up to the collarbone. Using iris scissors, make a small incision to the posterior end of the left ventricle. Insert an 18-gauge blunt- or olive-tipped perfusion needle into the ascending aorta, passing through the cut ventricle.\nSecure the needle and prevent leakage by clamping the heart with a hemostat. Alternatively, use a modified hemostat to clamp the aorta around the needle tip.\nMake a large incision in the right atrium, taking care to ensure minimal damage to the descending aorta. The rat is now ready for perfusion.\n3. Whole Perfusion and Dissection of Rat\nCaution: PFA and acrylamide are toxic irritants and thus should be handled in a fume hood with appropriate PPE.\nNOTE: The following whole perfusion steps are a similar to a protocol used in a previous study by Woo et al. (2016)10,11.\nAttach the right atrium of heart to an 18-gauge needle, taking care to not introduce any air bubbles.",
    "Using a 50 mL syringe, quickly and evenly pump 50 mL of cold 0.1 M PBS solution containing heparin (10 units/mL).\nConnect the 18-gauge needle to the tube of the peristaltic pump.\nWash with 200 mL of cold 0.1 M PBS solution containing heparin (10 units/mL) at a circulation velocity of 10 mL/min.\nFix with 250 mL of cold 4% PFA solution at a circulation velocity of 10 mL/min. The rat should be stiff at this stage.\nCollect and store the remaining PFA solution for disposal.\nFor PACT, perfuse tissues with a chilled PACT cocktail solution of 4% PFA, 4% acrylamide, and 0.25% VA-044 powder with an 18-gauge needle, and then remove the head and spine. Expose the skull by making a midline incision from the neck to the nose. This additional perfusion step is unnecessary for the psPACT and mPACT methods; after fixation, immediately isolate the head and spine and expose the skull.\nExpose the base of the skull by removing any residual neck and spine muscle.\nUse rongeurs and scissors to peel away the skull. Remove the brain and spinal cord.\nStore the tissue in 4% PFA at 4 °C; tissues can be stored for up to 1 week.\n4. Hydrogel Monomer Infusion and Polymerization of the Rat and Mouse CNS\nCaution: Acrylamide, SDS, α-thioglycerol and PFA are irritants and thus should be handled in a fume hood and with appropriate PEE.\nPACT (Passive Clearing Technique)\nIsolate and culture the whole CNS (brain and spinal cord) from fixed mice and rats to a 50 mL tube containing a chilled PACT cocktail solution of 4% PFA, 4% acrylamide, and 0.25% VA-044 powder and store at 4 °C for 24 h. Ensure that the tissue is completely immersed in the solution.",
    "Embed the sample in nitrogen gas for 10 min using a tissue gel hybridization system connected to a nitrogen tank: Set the system to 37 °C. Transfer tissues to a 50 mL tube containing fresh cold (4 °C) PACT cocktail solution and connect with tube cap, then turn on the vacuum.\nTo polymerize the hydrogel, place the tube containing the sample in a shaking incubator (150 rpm, 37 °C) for 3 h, or until polymerization is complete.\nUsing blotting paper (see Table of Materials), remove the remaining polymerized hydrogel surrounding the tissues.\nTransfer the tissue to a 50 mL tube containing clearing solution (8% SDS in 0.1 M PBS, pH 8.0).\nPlace the sample in a shaking incubator set to 37 °C and 150 rpm until the tissue has been cleared. On average, it takes about 20 days for the mouse CNS to achieve full clarity.\npsPACT (process separate Passive Clearing Technique)\nIsolate the whole CNS (brain and spinal cord) with bone cutter and scissors from PFA-fixed mice and rats on a clean bench.\nTransfer tissues to a 50 mL tube containing 4% PFA, and store at 4 °C for 24 h. Ensure that the tissue is completely immersed in the fixative.\nWash the fixed tissue for 1 h in 0.1 M PBS, and then transfer to A4P0 solution (4% acrylamide in 0.1 M PBS). Store at 37 °C for 24 h.\nWash the tissue for 5 min in 0.1 M PBS.\nImmerse the tissue in 0.25% VA-044 in 0.1 M PBS. Store at 37 °C for 6-24 h, and then transfer to fresh 0.25% VA-044/PBS solution.",
    "Embed the sample in nitrogen gas for 10 min using a tissue gel hybridization system (see Table of Materials) connected to a nitrogen tank: Transfer tissues to a 50 mL tube containing fresh cold (4 °C) 0.25% VA-044/PBS solution, and connect with tube cap. Turn on the vacuum.\nTransfer the tissue to clearing solution (8% SDS in 0.1 M PBS, pH 8.0).\nIncubate the sample in a shaking incubator set to 37 °C and 150 rpm until the tissue has been cleared. On average, it takes approximately 17 days for mouse CNS to achieve full clarity.\nmPACT (modified Passive Clearing Technique)\nIsolate the whole CNS (brain and spinal cord) with bone cutter and scissors from PFA-fixed mice and rats on a clean bench.\nFollow steps 4.2.2 - 4.2.8 of the psPACT protocol.\nTransfer the tissue to clearing solution. Note that unlike the PACT and psPACT protocols, mPACT requires a clearing solution consisting of 0.5% α-thioglycerol in addition to 8% SDS in 0.1 M PBS, pH 8.0. α-thioglycerol is an un-browning agent that helps clear tissue more rapidly and effectively. Ensure that the tissue is fully immersed in the solution.\nPlace the sample in a shaking incubator set to 37 °C and 150 rpm until the tissue has been cleared. On average, it takes approximately 2 weeks for mouse CNS to achieve full clarity.\n5. Refractive Index Matching and Immunostaining of Cleared CNS\nNOTE: nRIMS (Nycodenz-based Refractive Index Matching Solution) consists of 0.8 g/mL Nycodenz powder dissolved in 30 mL base buffer (0.01% sodium azide and Tween-20 in 0.1 M PBS, pH 8.0). It is recommended that the solution is placed in a 37 °C shaking incubator to allow for proper solvation of the powder.",
    "Incubate tissues in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS for 2 h, then block with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.1 M PBS for 6 h.\nWash sections three times in PBST (0.1% Tween-20 in 0.1 M PBS) for 2 h. Stain sections with primary antibodies (in this case, an anti-rabbit PECAM-CD31 antibody, which stains blood vessels) for 2 days.\nStain sections with secondary antibodies (in this case, a goat anti-rabbit IgG Cy3 fluorescent conjugate) in 2% BSA for 2 days.\nWash labeled tissues three times in PBST for 2 h, and store in 15 mL nRIMS for 2 - 10 days.\nBefore imaging, move labeled tissues to a small amount of nRIMS on 35- or 60-mm tissue culture dishes. Fix with silicone around the bottom edge of the dish.\nAdd 1.5 - 2 mL of fresh nRIMS.\n6. Image processing\nAcquire images of cleared tissues with tile scanning using a confocal laser-scanning microscopewith 10x magnification (see Table of Materials). For of Cy3-labeled tissue, use wavelengths of 550-600 nm.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
