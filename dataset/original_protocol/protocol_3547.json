    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1: Dissection of vertebral column\nTiming: 5–10 min per mouse\nDorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) are located in the intervertebral foramen adjacent to the spinal cord. It is therefore necessary to dissect the vertebral column before isolating the DRG. To decrease blood contamination, animals can be perfused with PBS prior to the dissection of the vertebral column.\nPrepare the perfusion syringe by adapting an 18G needle to a 10 mL syringe and aspirate 1× PBS. You can use one syringe for several mice.\nPrepare 1 × 50 mL Falcon tube for the collection of the vertebral column.\nFill the 50 mL Falcon with 20 mL of supplemented HBSS solution.\nSacrifice mouse\nSacrifice mice using CO2 inhalation, confirming the exposure was lethal.\nCritical: Do not perform cervical dislocation! This would disrupt the spinal cord and pulls on the spinal nerves that are connected to the DRG!\nAfter the mouse is sacrificed, lay the mouse on the dissection board in a supine position. Pin feet down with a needle for stabilization. Spray 70% ethanol on the fur of the mouse. Open the chest and expose the heart for perfusion. (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\nUse the forceps to pick up the skin around the bottom of the sternum (the highest point of the mouse chest when lying in a supine position). Make an incision using a pair of scissors.\nLift the bottom of the sternum with the forceps and cut along the diaphragm using the scissors. To avoid damage of the heart or lung, hold the forceps high and keep the tip of the scissor tip pointed ventrally, just under the sternum and the ribs.",
    "Lift the rib cage and expose the heart. You can cut out a little window of the sternum and the ribs to have a better view on the right atrium of the heart.\nMake an incision on the right atrium (deep red color compared to light red color of the ventricles) so the blood and perfusion buffer (PBS) can escape.\nUse forceps to carefully hold the heart, then pierce the heart at the left apex into the left ventricle using the perfusion syringe. Perfuse with 2–4 mL room temperature PBS.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. Post lethal intracardial perfusion; related to Step-by-step method details, step 4\nDissection of the vertebral column (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2])\nTurn the mouse to the ventral side and pin it to the dissection board again. Lift the skin at the base of the tail and make an incision over the whole back to the neck. Pin or cut away the skin to the sides so you have good access to the back of the mouse.\nMake a cut with your scissors at the lumbosacral joint and separate the sacrum from the lumbar spine.\nLift the spine with a forceps and cut through the muscles and ribs on the left and right side in cranial direction until the base of the skull.\nMake a cut through the spine at the atlanto-occipital joint.\nRemove any organs that might be attached to the tissue surrounding the spine.\nPlace the spine in a 50 mL Falcon tube filled with supplemented HBSS and put it on ice.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S2. Dissection of vertebral column; related to Step-by-step method details, step 5\nCleaning the spine from muscle and fatty tissues (Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3])",
    "To make the vertebral column better accessible, using fine bladed scissors carefully cut away all surrounding muscle, fat, and other soft tissue. Be careful to not damage the vertebral column. Also cut away the ribs from the thoracic part of the vertebral column.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S3. Removing ribs and soft tissue from the vertebral column; related to Step-by-step method details, step 6\nDRG dissection\nTiming: 15–30 min per mouse\nThe DRG dissection is the trickiest part of this protocol and it needs some practice. For this step you need a stereomicroscope.\nOpen the vertebral column to remove the spinal cord and gain access to the DRG\nOnce the vertebral column is cleared from the surrounding soft tissue and ribs, take a small micro-dissection scissor and put one scissor tip into the caudal spinal canal. Now carefully cut in the sagittal plane one vertebra at a time in cranial direction until the vertebral column is half opened. The easiest way is to hold the vertebral column with your fingers, so you have the best control over where you cut. Make sure the cut is in the middle of the vertebrae, as this will allow the best access to the DRG. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/469-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cutting the vertebral column sagittal in half and removal of the spinal cord\n(A) Dorsal view of vertebral column cleaned from all soft tissue and attached ribs. Vertebral proccessi spinosi and vertebral arcs are visible. The cut must be made exactly through processi spinosi in a sagittal approach from caudal to cranial.\n(B) Vertebral column split in half, view into the spinal canal with the remaining spinal cord on both sides.",
    "(C) View into the spinal canal after removal of the spinal cord. Intervertebral foramina and DRG are visible. Scale bar: 1 cm.\nNow turn the vertebral column and cut through the opposite side again from caudal to cranial, one processus spinosus vertebrae at a time in a sagittal direction.\nNow the vertebral column is split in half along the sagittal plane. Take a petri dish filled with supplemented HBSS. Lay down both half pieces so the spinal cord is visible. Take one tweezer to hold the vertebral column down and one tweezer to grasp the cranial aspect of the spinal cord and pull it out from cranial to caudal. Do this with both half pieces. Be careful not to pull too hard on the spinal roots, so the DRGs do not get pulled out. Put the petri dish with the two half pieces of the vertebral column on ice.\nNote: These steps can be performed with or without using the stereomicroscope. This is personal preference. (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4])\nPicking the DRG\nNote: These steps should be performed using a stereomicroscope.\nThe DRG are located in the intervertebral foramina connected to the spinal cord through the dorsal root but separated through the meninges.\nPrepare a 15 mL Falcon containing 15 mL supplemented DMEM media and keep it on ice, open the lid so you can easily put the DRG in the media.\nTake one half of the vertebral column from the Petri dish and leave the other in the HBSS on ice while you dissect the DRG from the first half.",
    "To adequately visualize the DRG, pin down one half of the vertebral column (e.g., using a Styr pore pin pad) so that the spinal canal is facing up. Now you are able to see the DRG in the intervertebral foramen beneath a shiny layer of meninges. Sometimes it is not easy to see them shine through. Especially in the beginning it is also helpful to use your tweezers to feel the openings between bony vertebrae where the foramina are and in which the DRG are located.\nTake a fine tweezer in one hand and a fine spring scissor in the other hand. Now feel that there are the bony vertebral arcs, and between them there is a soft hole, that is the intervertebral foramen. Take the tweezer and push with slightly opened ends into the foramen and take the DRG between the tweezer endings.\nTightly grasp the dorsal and ventral axon roots close to the DRG using your tweezers. Carefully pull it up a few millimeters, maintaining a tight grasp with your tweezers. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/469-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Picking DRG out of the intervertebral foramina and cut away the attached roots and spinal nerves\n(A) Vertebral column pinned onto a Styr pore pin pad for the DRG dissection.\n(B) View through a stereo microscope. DRGs are circled. Blue dotted line indicates ventral and dorsal roots. Attached are the dorsal and ventral root that can be used as an orientation.\n(C) DRG is circled.\n(D) DRG is tightly grasped by the fine tweezer and pulled out of the intervertebral foramen. Use a spring scissor to cut away the attached axon roots as depicted by the dotted line. Scale bars: (A) 1 cm, (B) 2 mm, (C) 2 mm, (D) 1.5 mm.",
    "Now take the spring scissor and cut away the spinal roots and spinal nerves that are attached to the DRG. The DRG is a slightly darker/yellow/beige in color then the spinal roots and nerves (appear white).\nCritical: This step will help you reduce myelin debris and glial cell contamination, which is important for downstream analysis like protein/RNA profiling.\nNow put the DRG into the 15 mL Falcon with supplemented DMEM. If it is a DRG, it will sink down.\nContinue collecting each DRG from all the intervertebral foramen.\nDiscard the now DRG-free vertebral column and repeat with the other half.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S4. Cutting the vertebral column sagittal in half; related to Step-by-step method details, step 7\nTroubleshooting 2 If you cannot easily see or access the intervertebral foramina it can help to spin the pin pad 180° and start from the other side. It does not matter if the DRGs are collected from cranial to caudal or vice versa.\nOptional: If you want to use the DRG for downstream RNA profiling, you can directly collect them into 350 μL of RLT buffer into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube (we recommend using the RNeasy plus micro kit from QIAGEN for RNA isolation).\nNote: Before starting the RNA isolation protocol, it is best to homogenize the DRG in RLT buffer using a Dounce-homogenizer.",
    "Optional: If you want to use the DRG for microscopy, you can directly collect them into 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Leave the DRG in 4% paraformaldehyde for 6–18 h at 22°C for fixation. Take the DRG out of the PFA using a tweezer and put them into 15% sucrose solution (15 g sucrose in 100 mL PBS) into a new Eppendorf tube for 24 h at 4°C. After that, take the DRG out and put them into 30% sucrose solution (30 g sucrose in 100 mL PBS) and store at 4°C for at least 24 h or for longer time periods until you want to perform cryostat cutting. Prior to cryostat sectioning, first place the DRG in OCT and keep for at least 18 h or longer time periods at −80°C. OCT frozen DRGs are now ready for cryostat cutting and staining (Hill et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Kalinski et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: Perfusion of the mouse with 4% paraformaldehyde instead of PBS, prior to dissection, improves the downstream immune fluorescence and can be performed if no DRGs are collected for live cell applications.\nDRG digest and plating for culture\nTiming: 3 h\nNote: These steps should be performed in a tissue culture hood.\nPlace the Collagenase A/Dispase II Mix in a 37°C water bath.\nSpin down the DRG in a 15 mL Falcon at 161 × g (1,000 rpm) for 5 min.\nRemove DMEM carefully by using a serological pipette. The DRG do not form a firm pellet, so there is a significant risk of losing them by removing the media using a vacuum.\nAdd 3 mL of 37°C Collagenase A/Dispase II mix to the DRG.\nLeave the DRG in the Collagenase A/Dispase II mix in a 37°C incubator shaking (around 150 rpm) for 15 min.",
    "Spin down at 161 × g for 5 min. Remove the Collagenase A/Dispase II solution carefully by using a serological pipette.\nCarefully wash the pellet by adding 10 mL DMEM. Do not resuspend! Spin down 161 × g for 5 min.\nRemove DMEM carefully by using a serological pipette.\nResuspend in culture media (supplemented Neurobasal media containing cytokines). For the amount of media to use in this step, calculate the number of wells you want to culture + 2 × 30 μL (1 mL max). Whether you use a 24 well plate or 96 well plate you will add the same amount of neurons in media to each well (e.g., for 20 wells of either a 24 well plate or a 96 well plate, plan for the culture of sensory neurons from 1 mouse → (20 + 2) × 30 μL = resuspend in 660 μL culture media).\nTake a 1 mL syringe and triturate the DRG solution by aspirating and ejecting the DRGs in solution 7 times up and down for each needle size starting with an 18 gauge needle, followed by a 23 gauge, and 28 gauge needle.\nCritical: Count cells using a hemocytometer to plate equal cell numbers if you have different mouse lines/conditions that you are comparing and for inter-experimental reproducibility. There will be significant debris visible in the hemocytometer, just count the round cell bodies that are approximately 10 μm in diameter. You should get >40,000–60,000 per one adult mouse. Plate neurons with a density of approximately 15,000 neurons per cm2, which equals 2,500–3,000 neurons per 30 μL droplet.",
    "Remove the Laminin droplet from 4 wells using vacuum so there is thin liquid layer left and immediately plate 30 μL of the cell suspension on the area that is laminin coated. Do not let the laminin evaporate completely before you add the cell suspension. Keep the time between removing the droplet of laminin and the plating of the cell suspension droplet to less than 1 min.\nContinue with the next 4 wells by removing the laminin and plating 30 μL of cell suspension.\nIncubate the plate or wells for 1 h at 37°C.\nAdd 200 μL culture media per well (96 well plate), 500 μL culture media per well (24 well plate), or 2 mL culture media/well for 2.5 cm petri dish single wells (e.g., for calcium imaging).\nIncubate 18–24 h at 37°C.\nThe cells are ready for experiments.\nNote: If you want to plate more than 20 wells (by pooling the DRG of several mice), you can resuspend in more than 1 mL in step 17, depending on the number of wells and mice you use. It is critical therefore to take a 5 mL syringe in the following step 18.\nDay 2: Sensory neuron in vitro stimulation with papain to study Substance P and CGRP release\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: The description is for a set of 8 wells with cultured sensory neurons in a 96 well plate. 4 wells will be left unstimulated with only the vehicle control and 4 wells will be stimulated with 25 μg/mL Papain (750 USP units per mL).\nNote: Prepare the 10 mg/mL papain solution fresh by dissolving 100 mg papain in 10 mL PBS. Keep solution on ice.\nPrepare 2 Eppendorf tubes with 1 mL supplemented Neurobasal media without cytokines.\nAdd 2.5 μL media only in the unstimulated control tube.",
    "Add 2.5 μL of papain dissolved in PBS (10 mg/mL) to the papain tube to get a 25 μg/mL papain concentration.\nVortex both tubes for 5–10 s.\nCarefully remove the media of 4 wells at a time by bringing your pipette to the edge of the plate where no DRG neurons are attached and slowly aspirate.\nAdd 200 μL of either the unstimulated media (4 wells) or the papain containing media (the other 4 wells) to each well by slowly dripping it down the wall of the well.\nIncubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant by placing your pipette on the edge of the plate where no DRG neurons are attached and slowly aspirate.\nPipette the supernatant into a fresh 96 well plate.\nYou can either snap freeze the supernatant on dry ice and then store at −80°C until you proceed with the Substance P and CGRP ELISA, or you can put it on ice and use it directly.\nFor the ELISA see the manufactures instructions:\nSubstance P ELISA Kit: https://www.caymanchem.com/pdfs/583751.pdf[href=https://www.caymanchem.com/pdfs/583751.pdf]\nCGRP (rat) EIA Kit: https://www.caymanchem.com/pdfs/589001.pdf[href=https://www.caymanchem.com/pdfs/589001.pdf]"
