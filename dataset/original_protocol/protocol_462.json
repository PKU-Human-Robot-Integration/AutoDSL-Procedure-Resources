    "The full protocol is available as an attachment.  The following is a summary that is also found in the attached full protocol.\nPart 1: \n1) Baseline assessments are taken the evening before dosing\n2) Subjects are given study medication after an overnight fast and 2 hours before their first meal.\n3) Part 1 includes 4 dose cohorts:  cohorts 1 and 2 consist of 4 subjects each, whereas Cohorts 3 and 4 will consist of 8 subjects each. \n4) Subjects are randomized at a 3 \\(active) to 1 \\(placebo) ratio. \n5) Each subject receives a single dose of either 0.1 mg/kg \\(Cohort 1), 0.5 mg/kg \\(Cohort 2), 3 mg/kg \\(Cohort 3) or 10 mg/kg \\(Cohort 4) of tildrakizumab IV administered over 1 hour; a minimum of 48 hours will elapse between drug administration to subjects. \n6) After an 8-week safety observation period, each subject in Part 1 \\(Cohorts 1 through 4) receives an additional two doses of tildrakizumab IV at 0.1, 0.5, 3, and 10 mg/kg, respectively, 4 weeks apart.\n7) On Day 2, safety assessments are performed and PK samples obtained. \n8) Subjects receive Dose 2 on Day 56\n9) Subjects receive Dose 3 on Day 84\n10) Subjects have a closeout visit within 14 days of the last safety and PK assessment.\nPart 2 \n1. Up to 40 subjects with psoriasis are enrolled in Part 2\n  2. Subjects are put into 2 dose cohorts \\(Cohorts 5 and 6). \n  3. Subjects in Cohort 5 receive 3 doses of 3 mg/kg tildrakizumab IV given at Week 0, 4, and 8. \n  4. Subjects in Cohort 6 receive 3 doses of 10 mg/kg tildrakizumab IV given at Week 0, 4, and 8.\n  5. Subjects are randomized in a 3:1 ratio of active to placebo.",
    "6. Serum pharmacokinetic samples are obtained predose and at the intervals specified in the attached full protocol \n  7. Subjects receive Dose 2 and 3 of tildrakizumab during their visits on Days 28 and 56. \n  8. Subjects have a closeout visit within 14 days of the last PK assessment.\n  9. A closeout visit will be scheduled within 14 days of the last PK assessment. \n  \nSkin biopsy, pharmacokinetic, and safety details are provided in the attached full protocol"
