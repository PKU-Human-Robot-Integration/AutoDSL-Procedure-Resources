    "Isolation of mesenchymal cells from suture mesenchymeDissect a 2 mm wide portion of calvarial tissue containing the sagittal (SAG) suture and its adjacent parietal bones from mouse calvarium (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4339/bioprotoc-12-05-4339-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of mouse calvarial bones and sutures. F, frontal bone; P, parietal bone; IP, interparietal bone.Hint: It is easy to remove the calvarium from the meninges. The cutout size should be as small as possible, to limit the amounts of contaminant cells from the bone marrow and periosteum.Grab both sides of the parietal bones with two forceps and gently pull them apart (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4339/bioprotoc-12-05-4339-g002.jpgFigure 2. Schematic diagrams illustrating the separation of bone pieces to release the cells from the suture mesenchyme. Attention: The dissected calvarial tissue containing two small parietal bone pieces must be separated in the midline to expose the suture mesenchyme. Otherwise, the number of skeletal stem cells would be significantly reduced.Hint: To avoid contamination of stem cells from the bone marrow, do not cut the separated calvarial tissue into pieces (this process is performed for calvarial cell isolation). Do not keep the dissected tissue on ice, rather quickly incubate it with Digestion Buffer as described in step 6.Submerge the separated pieces in 40 mL of Digestion Buffer and incubate in a shaker at 200 × g (MaxQtm 4000 Benchtop Orbital Shakers) and 37°C for 1 h.Filter the dissociated cells through a 40 µm strainer.Spindown the cells by centrifugation at 400 × g and 4°C for 7 min.Remove the supernatant to collect the cell pellets.Hint: About 5 × 104 cells can be obtained from one sagittal sutureHint: Suture mesenchymal cells have been successfully isolated from the calvaria of mice at postnatal day 10 (P10) and P28.Sphere cultureResuspend the cell pellets with Sphere Culture Media and count the cell number.",
    "Seed the cells in 2 mL of sphere culture media at 104–105 cells per well on an Ultra-Low Attachment Surface 24-well plate (Figure 3A).Carefully change half the amount of the culture media in the culture every other day, without disturbance of cell settling.Hint: Sphere formation will be visible within 10 to 14 days (Figure 3B and Maruyama et al., 2021).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4339/bioprotoc-12-05-4339-g003.jpgFigure 3. Representative images showing cells after 1 day (A) and 8 days (B) of the sphere culture. Scale bars, 200 µm.Hint: Most of the sphere is derived from a single stem cell (Maruyama et al., 2021).Hint: Stem cell stemness, e.g., bone-forming ability and quiescence, has been demonstrated to be maintained in culture using the 1st and 3rd passage of the sphere by kidney capsule transplantation and label-retaining analyses (Maruyama et al., 2021).Hint: Bone-forming ability is assessed by the kidney capsule transplantation assay, followed by von Kossa staining and immunostaining of osteoblast markers. Quiescence is examined by the pulse-chase assay in sphere culture.Passaging spheresSome spheres may be weakly attached to the bottom of the well. To detach the sphere, gently pipette the culture media up and down.The cell suspension is collected by centrifugation at 300 × g and 4°C for 7 min.Remove the supernatant and tap the tube to gently break up the pellets.Add 1 mL of 0.25% Trypsin to resuspend the pellet, followed by incubation at 37°C for 5 min.Add 1 mL of 2× SBTI solution to stop the activity of the trypsin.Centrifuge at 300 × g and 4°C for 7 min.Remove supernatant and tap the tube to gently break up the pellets.Resuspend the cells in the Sphere Culture Media and count cell numbers.Seed the cells at 104–105 cells per well.Hint: This culture method has been limited to five passages."
