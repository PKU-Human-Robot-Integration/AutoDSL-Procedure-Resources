    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFirst cross\nTiming: 30–45 min followed by 10–13 days incubation\nThe generation of positively marked tumors is achieved by selective breeding of transgenic and mutant flies. Male flies carrying the UAS-transgene line in the 3rd chromosome will be crossed to virgin female flies with the FRT site and tubGal80 on the 2nd chromosome (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Genetic markers will be used to identify and track the progeny carrying the transgenes of interest.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/833-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cross scheme\nCross scheme required for the generation of positively marked lethal (2) giant larvae4 (lgl4) homozygous mutant tumors, with the knockdown of an additional gene specifically within the mutant tissue. First cross, females containing a specific FRT site (in this case, in position 40a) and tub-Gal80 are crossed with UAS-RNAi males. Second cross, male F1 progeny of the correct genotype are identified by the absence of short hairs (MKRS) and crossed with females of the genotype shown. Estimated waiting times are indicated for each step. For a description of each transgene and mutation refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. For the description of each genetic marker and balancer chromosome refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_833_1.csv\nTable outlining the function of genetic constructs incorporated into the Drosophila genome.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_833_2.csv\nCollect approximately 20 virgin female flies of the stock w; FRT40a, tub-Gal80; MKRS / TM6b\nVerify that the stock is expressing both MKRS and TM6b genetic markers.\nFlies must exhibit the phenotypes corresponding to these markers, namely: tubby (short, fat body), humeral (extra macrochaetes) and stubble hairs (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nCritical: Females must be virgin flies, otherwise the F1 progeny will be mixed with flies of the original stock.\nCritical: Verify that the genetic markers are correctly expressed, this is critical in all steps.",
    "Collect males of the specific UAS-transgene of interest located on the 3rd chromosome.\nSelect approximately 5 males of the stock w; ; UAS-transgene\nPlace the collected virgin flies from step 1 with the males from step 2 in a fresh vial of food.\nIncubate at 25°C\nFlip the parent flies to a fresh vial of food twice a week. Keep both the old vials (containing the freshly laid eggs and larvae) and the new vials (containing the adult flies) at 25°C.\nAdult wild type flies emerge within approximately 10 days, although some mutant flies might take longer. To prevent progeny from mixing with the parents, do not use vials that are 17 days or older at 25°C.\nCritical: Do not let the F1 progeny mix with the parent flies.\nSecond cross\nTiming: 30–45 min in 3–4 consecutive days followed by 5–8 days incubation\nThe aim of this step is to cross specific F1 progeny males carrying the FRT site, tubGal80 and UAS-transgene with virgin females carrying the lgl mutant allele, FRT site, Ubx-Flp, Pnr-Gal4 and UAS-GFP:moe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nSelect approximately 5 TM6b positive males from the progeny of the first cross.\nDiscard the females and screen the male F1 progeny for the tubby (short, fat body) and humeral (extra macrochaetes) genetic markers (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). Discard MKRS positive flies as they do not have an identifiable phenotype at the pupal stage; a pupal marker is required to confirm the presence of the UAS-transgene in the F2 progeny.\nOptional: The first cross can be moved to 18°C once the males have been selected and the second cross has been carried out. Fly development is slowed at 18°C, and the first cross should be kept in case additional second crosses have to be set.",
    "Collect approximately 20 virgin female flies of the stock Ubx-Flp; FRT40a, lgl4/CyO-GFP; Pnr-Gal4, UAS-GFP:moe / TM6b\nVerify that the stock is expressing CyO-GFP.\nFlies must have curly wings and ubiquitous GFP expression (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nIt is normal to have a mix of TM6b positive and negative flies in this stock, since Pnr-Gal4, UAS-GFP:moe is semi-lethal and some flies will be homozygous.\nPlace the collected males from step 5 with the virgin flies from step 6 in a fresh vial of food.\nSet up the genetic crosses for the controls. A number of controls can be used in this experiment including (1) clones expressing the UAS-transgene without the background mutation, (2) clones homozygous mutant for the background mutation but without UAS-transgene expression, and (3) wild-type clones (no background mutation and no transgene expression). All controls will be labeled with GFP:moe\nTo generate UAS-transgene clones without the lgl4 mutation, cross the males from step 5 to virgin females of the following genotype: Ubx-Flp; FRT40a; Pnr-Gal4,UAS-GFP:moe / TM6b.\nOnly one cross is required to generate lgl4 mutant clones without the UAS-transgene. Cross the female virgins from step 6 with males of the following genotype: w; FRT40a, tub-Gal80.\nFor wild type clones, only one cross is required. Cross Ubx-Flp; FRT40a; Pnr-Gal4,UAS-GFP:moe / TM6b female virgins to w; FRT40a, tub-Gal80 males.\nFollow the same subsequent steps for the controls. All controls are treated in the same conditions as experimental flies.\nIncubate at 25°C\nFlip the parent flies to a fresh vial of food twice a week. Keep both the old vials (containing the freshly laid eggs and larvae) and the new vials (containing the adult flies) at 25°C.",
    "Flies will reach the pupal stage after approximately 5–8 days. Check the vials regularly, they will be ready for the next step (pupa collection) as soon as pupae start to form.\nOptional: We recommend setting at least two second crosses for each genotype to have sufficient F2 progeny.\nIdentify F2 pupae of interest\nTiming: 5–10 min every hour for 4–5 h. Can be done daily until the target n number has been reached.\nIn this step, the F2 progeny will be collected at the pre-pupal stage and screened for the correct genetic markers.\nScreen the F2 vials and collect all the TM6b negative pre-pupae at 0 h APF (after puparium formation) using a damp small brush. This step lasts approximately 10-min. Brown pupae can be discarded or left attached to the sides of the vials.\nThe pre-pupal phase is a short transitional phase of approximately 30-min, between the larval and the pupal stages. Pre-pupae, unlike larvae, are immobile and are attached to the side of the vial, and unlike pupae, have a white/pale-yellow color (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). White pre-pupae are designated to be at 0 h APF.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/833-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Pupa screening\nRepresentative images of pupae expressing different markers, with emphasis on the selection of animals due to the presence/absence of genetic markers. An image is accompanied by a cartoon representation to emphasize the phenotypes to be identified.\n(A) The pre-pupal stage is a short transitional phase between the larval and the pupal stages. Pre-pupae, unlike larvae, are immobile and are attached to the side of the vial, and unlike pupae, have a white/pale-yellow color. White pre-pupae are designated to be at 0 h APF (after puparium formation); flies should be collected at the pre-pupal stage.",
    "(B–D) Phenotypes to discard. (B) TM6b positive pupae are tubby (shorter and fatter than wild-type); collect only TM6b negative pupae. (C) Discard Cyo-GFP pupae. These are easily identifiable as they express ubiquitous GFP. (D) Discard pupae with fluorescent salivary glands, as they did not segregate tub-Gal80.\n(E and F) Phenotype of interest at pre-pupal stages (E) and at imaging stages (≥12 h APF) (F). Pupae of interest must be (1) non-tubby, and (2) GFP-positive only in small clones in the notum area. Entirely non-fluorescent pupae must also be collected, as the clones may be too small for detection when using a fluorescence dissecting stereomicroscope.\nPupae carrying the TM6b balancer are identified by their short tubby phenotype (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). By selecting against TM6b, the collected pupae will carry the UAS-transgene, Pnr-Gal4 and UAS-GFP:moe.\nCritical: Flies must be collected at 0 h APF to be able to accurately determine the age of the pupa before imaging the next day.\nPlace the pupa on a petri dish covered with tissue paper soaked in water. Clearly label the exact time the pupa was collected and the genotype. This will allow you to correctly age the pupae prior to mounting.\nScreen the collected pre-pupae for fluorescent markers.\nDiscard CyO-GFP positive flies. These flies can be easily identified by their ubiquitous GFP expression (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). CyO-GFP negative flies will possess both the FRT site and lgl mutant allele.\nDiscard GFP positive salivary glands. The salivary glands are two parallel tubes located on the ventral side of the pupa (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). Pnr-Gal4 drives UAS-transgene expression (including UAS-GFP:moe) in the notum and salivary glands (Giagtzoglou et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Flies that possess tubGal80 will repress Gal4 activity in the salivary glands, thus this tissue should be UAS-GFP:moe negative.",
    "Pupae of interest must be (1) non-tubby, and (2) GFP-positive only in small clones in the notum area. Entirely non-fluorescent pupae must also be collected, as the clones may be too small for detection when using a fluorescence dissecting stereomicroscope.\nIncubate the pupae carrying the correct markers at 29°C overnight.\nPupae are ready to mount from 12 h APF. Prior to 12 h APF epithelia and puparium are attached together, therefore removal of the pupal case is not possible before this stage.\nPupae are imaged between 20–24 h APF. We found these stages to be the most ideal for the study of tumor progression as the tissue is in a post-mitotic stage. At 29°C, pupae reach this age within approximately 18-h.\nPupae that are older than 24 h APF can still be imaged. However, macrochaetae specification and eventually hair growth can potentially interfere with the observation of phenotypes.\nOptional: We recommend collecting white pre-pupae every hour between 12–4 p.m. Pupae will then be ready for imaging the next morning.\nPupa mounting for live imaging\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes the steps for mounting the pupa and the preparations needed for high resolution confocal imaging. It is recommended that you mount multiple pupae, ready for imaging. Image the pupae from oldest to youngest, since the pupae continue to age whilst mounted. Always image control pupae that are the same age as the experimental pupae.\nAssemble the slides (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/833-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Pupa mounting for live imaging",
    "(A and B) Pupal case removal. The brown pupal case interferes with the fluorescent signal and must be removed before imaging. Use forceps to uncover the head and dorsal thorax region of the animal. (A) Use tungsten forceps to pull the pupal case away from the pupa body, red dashed lines indicate the recommended cut lines. (B) Only uncover the head and dorsal thorax region of the animal. It is important to handle the pupa gently and pull the case without piercing the body of the pupa; the animal must be alive at the time of imaging.\n(C) A pupa mounted and ready for imaging. Double sided sticky tape is used to glue the pupa to the microscope slide. Stacks of square coverslips on the edges of the slide form a bridge to prevent squashing. A rectangular coverslip with a thin layer of immersion oil is placed on top of the square coverslip stacks. Refer to steps 14–18 of this protocol.\nGrab a microscope slide and place double sided sticky tape lengthways along the center of the slide (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nRemove the protective paper to uncover the upper sticky side.\nAssemble 2 stacks of approximately 3–5 square coverslips (22 × 22 mm). Use nail polish to glue the square coverslips together. The number of coverslips used will depend on the size of the pupa, which does vary. Usually, the posterior side of the animal is larger than the anterior and may require an additional coverslip.\nUse nail polish to glue the stack of coverslips to the anterior and posterior ends of the microscope slide. This will create a bridge to prevent squashing of the pupa once the 22 × 50 mm coverslip is placed, in step 18.",
    "Place the pupa on the center of the slide, on top of the sticky tape, with the ventral side facing down. Wait approximately 10-min for the pupa to fully attach to the tape. This will allow the immobilization of the pupa during imaging.\nCarefully remove a small region of the pupal case with tungsten forceps to expose the notum (see Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSpread one side of a rectangular coverslip (22 × 50 mm) with a thin layer of 10S voltalef injection oil to create an interface between the coverslip and the exposed notum.\nPlace the coverslip on top of the pupa, the side covered with oil facing down.\nThe rectangular coverslip should be resting on the square coverslip stacks from step 14.\nVerify that the rectangular coverslip is touching the notum (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). An interface on the notum (and occasionally also the head) should be clearly visible. Avoid forming air-bubbles between the notum and the coverslip.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/833-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Oil interphase for confocal imaging\nExamples of the most common mistakes during pupa mounting.\n(A) The square cover slip bridge is too high. The oil interphase on top of the notum is very small and either only a very small area of the notum can be imaged, or the images will appear blurry. Remove one cover slip at a time until the interphase reaches the ideal size (see B).\n(B) Correct mounting, the number of square cover slips is ideal, and the rectangular cover slip is in contact with the entire notum.\n(C) The square cover slip bridge is too low. The rectangular cover slip will be too close to the pupa and it will be squashed and perhaps damaged. Animals that have been damaged due to squashing cannot be used.",
    "Adjust the bridge if necessary. Add or remove square coverslips from either side of the stack if necessary. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nOnce happy with the size of the interface, fix the long coverslip to the square coverslip stacks using nail polish.\nKeep assembled slides in a humid atmosphere, to avoid animal desiccation, until ready for imaging.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Pupal mounting, related to steps 14–18\nConfocal live imaging\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes the settings used for live imaging of tumors using a confocal microscope.\nEquip the confocal microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective and a 488 nm laser.\nCarefully identify and focus the GFP positive clones on the dorsal thorax of the pupa (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nThe animal should be GFP negative. Only clusters of cells in the dorsal thorax of the pupa should be GFP:moe positive. Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nFor initial screening, the whole notum should be imaged with a single z-stack (use two z-stacks if the clones are very large and do not fit one field of view). Set the confocal microscope to take optical slices every 1 μm, from the cuticle to the basal lamina (until no GFP:moe signal is observed). You should image the entire dorsal thorax epithelial sheet at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 (375 × 375 μm).\nImage at least 5 animals per genotype.\nThis model is highly reproducible, we have found that 5 animals provide statistically relevant data.\nTumors generated with different background genes may require more animals per genotype. Determine the most appropriate sample size by performing a power calculation."
