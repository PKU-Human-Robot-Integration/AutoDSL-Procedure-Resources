    "This experimental protocol has been approved by the Human Subjects Protection Committee at the University of California, San Diego.\n1. Human Subjects\nRecruit healthy right-handed adult volunteers, obtain their consent, and screen them on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\nNOTE: In this study, twenty young, healthy individuals (mean ± standard deviation [SD] age = 25.3 ± 4.4 years) including 8 women were recruited who drink in moderation, who have never been in treatment or arrested for drug or alcohol related offenses, who report no alcoholism-related symptoms on the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test28, who do not smoke nor use illegal substances, who do not have a history of neuropsychiatric disorders or any current health problems, and who are medication free and have no internal ferromagnetic objects or implants.\n2. Experimental Design\nScan each participant four times, including three MEG sessions (a no-beverage introductory session and two experimental beverage sessions in which alcohol and placebo are administered in a counterbalanced manner), and one structural MRI scan.\nNOTE: In this within-subject design, participants serve as their own controls by participating in both alcohol and placebo sessions. This design reduces error variance and increases statistical power by minimizing influence of individual variability in brain anatomy, activity patterns, and alcohol metabolism.\n3. Collecting MEG Scans\nPerform familiarization session.\nDuring the initial introductory session, administer questionnaires to obtain more information about the participants' medical history, their drinking patterns and severity of alcoholism-related symptoms28,29, family history of alcoholism30, and personality traits including impulsivity31,32.\nCarry out an initial recording in the MEG scanner following the protocol described below in steps 3.2, 3.3, and 3.5. Do not provide any beverage. Explain the task and run the practice version allowing participants to get familiarized with it beforehand.",
    "NOTE: The acclimation to the experimental situation serves the purpose of minimizing potential effects of situation-induced arousal33, thereby equating subsequent alcohol and placebo sessions on that dimension.\nPerform the alcohol/placebo experimental sessions.\n\tNOTE: Follow the same experimental procedures during both alcohol and placebo sessions with the exception of the administered beverage. Counterbalance beverage order by administering alcohol beverage first to one half of participants and placebo to the other half in a random order.\n\t\nUpon their arrival to the MEG lab, run a brief test scan by putting the participant in the scanner and checking the channels for possible magnetization. Measure their weight. Screen them with an electronic breathalyzer. Query them about compliance with the requirements to abstain from alcohol for 48 h and from food for 3 h prior to the experiment.\nCollect urine samples for a multi-drug test panel from all participants and exclude those who test positive for any drug. In addition, check female participants for pregnancy with a urine test and exclude those who test positive or if they suspect that they might be pregnant.\nAssess dynamic changes in the subjective effects of alcohol by asking participants to rate their momentary feelings and states on a standardized scale34 prior to drinking and on two additional occasions during the experiment - on the ascending limb (~15 min after consuming beverage) and descending limb of the breath alcohol concentration curve (BrAC), after the MEG recording.\nAdminister a practice run of the Stroop task on a laptop with stimulus presentation software to ensure that the participants understand the task before recording.",
    "NOTE: This version of the Stroop task combines reading and color naming (Figure 1). The congruent condition consists of color words (i.e., red, green, blue, yellow) that are printed in the matching font color (i.e., the word \"green\" is printed in green). In the incongruous condition, color words are printed in color that does not match their meaning (i.e., the word \"green\" is printed in yellow). Ask the participants to press one of four buttons corresponding to the font color whenever a word is written in color, or, when a word is written in gray, to press a button corresponding to the meaning of the word18,23.\nPrepare the MEG/EEG recording.\n\tNOTE: Details of MEG data acquisition have been described in previous publications35,36,37.\n\t\nPosition the EEG cap or individual EEG electrodes on the head of the participant and check that all impedances are below 5 kΩ.\nAttach the head position indicator (HPI) coils on either side of the forehead and behind each ear.\nNOTE: This step is specific to Neuromag systems.\nDigitize positions of the fiducial points including the nasion and two preauricular points, positions of HPI coils, EEG electrodes, and obtain a large number of additional points (~200) delineating the head shape. Use this information for the co-registration with anatomical MRI images (Figure 2).\nAdminister beverage.\nPrepare alcohol beverage by mixing premium quality vodka with chilled orange juice (25% v/v), based on each participant's gender and weight (0.60 g/kg alcohol for men, 0.55 g/kg alcohol for women), targeting a BrAC of 0.06%38. Serve the same volume of orange juice in glasses with rims swabbed with vodka as a placebo beverage. Ask the participant to consume the beverage in approximately 10 min.",
    "Check the participants' BrAC with the breathalyzer starting at ~15 min after drinking and then every 5 min until they enter the recording chamber. Since electronic devices cannot be used in the shielded room, use a saliva alcohol test, which consists of a cotton swab that is saturated in saliva and is inserted into a receptacle that provides a readout.\nAcquire MEG/EEG data.\nPosition the participant comfortably in the scanner. Since the prefrontal activity is of particular interest, ensure that the participant is positioned so that his/her head is touching the top of the helmet and is aligned along the front.\nNOTE: Head position can affect activity estimates in significant ways because the magnetic field gradients decrease with the cube of the distance between the sensors and the brain sources39.\nConnect HPI coils and all of the electrodes to their respective inputs on the scanner. Position response pads so that the buttons can be pressed comfortably. Ascertain that the font is clearly legible on the projection screen in front of the participant.\nBack in the console room, check that the intercom is functioning properly. Remind the participant to minimize blinking and to avoid movements including head motion caused by talking. Instruct the participant to reply to questions by pressing response buttons instead.\nCheck that all response and stimulus triggers are recorded correctly. Examine all channels for artifacts and measure the head position in the scanner.\nStart data acquisition and begin the task. Give breaks every ~2.5 min to rest the eyes. Save the data upon task completion and escort the participant out of the recording chamber.\nWhen the participant has exited the scanner, acquire approximately two minutes of data from the empty room as a measure of instrumental noise.",
    "Ask the participant to rate perceived task difficulty, content of the imbibed beverage, how intoxicated they felt, as well as their momentary moods and feelings34.\n4. Image Acquisition and Cortical Reconstruction of Structural MRI\nObtain a high-resolution anatomical MRI scan for each participant, and reconstruct each participant's cortical surface with FreeSurfer software40,41,42.\nUse the inner skull surface derived from the segmented structural MRI images to generate a boundary element model of the volume conductor, which is used to provide a model for the forward solution that is consistent with each individual's brain anatomy43,44.\n5. MEG Data Analysis\nNOTE: Analyze the data with the anatomically-constrained MEG approach which uses each participant's reconstructed cortical surface to constrain source estimates to the cortical ribbon40,45,46. The analysis stream relies on custom functions with dependencies on publicly available packages including FieldTrip47, EEGLab48, and MNE49.\nDuring data preprocessing, use a permissive band-pass filter (e.g., 0.1 - 100 Hz) and epoch data with respect to stimulus onset into segments that include padding intervals on each end (e.g., -600 to 1100 ms for an interval of interest spanning -300 to 800 ms after the removal of padding).\nRemove noisy and flat channels, as well as trials containing artifacts by visual inspection and using threshold-based rejection. Use independent component analysis48 to remove eyeblink and heartbeat artifacts. Eliminate trials with incorrect responses.\nApply Morlet wavelets (Figure 3)47 to calculate complex power spectrum for each trial in 1 Hz increments for theta frequency band (4 - 7 Hz). Remove any additional artifacts. Compute the noise covariance from empty room data.\nCo-register the MEG data with MRI images using the three-dimensional (3D) head digitization information (Figure 2).\nOpen the MRIlab module.\nSelect File| Open| Select subject's structural MRI.\nSelect File| Import| Isotrak data| select raw data.fif file| Make Points.",
    "Select Windows| Landmarks| Adjust fiducial landmarks until co-registration of MEG data and MRI are acceptable.\nSelect File| Save.\nCalculate noise-sensitivity normalized estimates of theta source power and phase with a spectral dynamic statistical mapping approach18,50. Express event-related theta source power as percent signal change relative to baseline.\nCreate group averages of event-related theta source power by morphing each participant's estimates onto an average cortical representation51.\nVisualize the source estimates on an inflated average surface to enhance visibility of sulcal estimates (Figure 4).\nOpen the MNE software.\nSelect File| Load Surface| Load inflated group-average FreeSurfer cortical surface.\nSelect File| Manage overlays| Load stc| Load group-averaged data| Select loaded file from available overlays.\nSelect overlay type as Other.\nAdjust Color Scale thresholding| Show.\nView brain movies and examine spatio-temporal stages of processing by identifying areas and time windows characterized by highest activation.\nCreate unbiased regions of interest (ROIs) based on overall group-averaged estimates to incorporate cortical locations with most notable source power. Calculate time courses for each subject, condition, and ROI (Figure 5).\nSubmit the obtained theta source power estimates to the statistical analysis.\nExtract time windows of interest from each ROI time course and perform analysis of variance (ANOVA) with beverage (alcohol, placebo) and trial type (congruous, incongruous) as within subject factors. Use a nonparametric cluster-based permutation test52 to examine beverage and condition comparisons of event-related theta power as well as phase-locking values (PLV).\nEstimate task-related changes in the long-range synchronization between the main activation foci in the ACC and the latPFC by computing the PLV12. Express PLV as percent change relative to baseline.\nNOTE: The PLV is an indicator of consistency of the phase angle between the two ROIs across trials as it measures the extent to which they co-oscillate at a particular frequency and in real time (Movie 1).",
