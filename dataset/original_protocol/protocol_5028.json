    "ExpressionInoculate a flask containing 200 ml LB-medium and 200 µl ampicillin (final concentration: 100 µg/ml) with approximately 5 ml overnight culture with the desired construct (see Materials and Reagents A1. point) to an OD600 of 0.1.Incubate the culture under shaking (200 rpm) at 37 °C up to an OD600 of 0.2-0.3 (approx. 45-90 min).Lower temperature to 22 °C (shaker incubator).At an OD600 of 0.4-0.6 induce expression by 500 µM IPTG (100 µl 1 M IPTG/200 ml culture).Cell harvestingHarvest the cells at an OD600 of 2.0-2.8 (120-150 min after induction).Collect cells at 3,200 x g for 10 min at 4 °C (Sorvall centrifuge).Add 25 ml of wash-buffer (4 °C) to the pellet, suspend by vortexing and pellet at 4,300 x g for 30 min at 4 °C (Heraeus centrifuge).Discard supernatant and store cells at -80 °C or continue with the membrane preparation.Membrane preparationThaw frozen cells on ice and suspend in 25 ml of lysis-buffer (4 °C) by vortexing.Notes:  The cell pellet should be completely dissolved to avoid clogging the outlet of the Aminco® French Pressure Cell. Add always the cOmpleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet just before using the lysis-buffer.Lyse cells mechanically by French press (1,100 psi) twice (Figure 2). Notes:  Aminco® French Pressure Cell should be kept pre-cooled at 4 °C. Open outlet of the Aminco® French Pressure Cell such that a flow drop by drop is visible. Make sure that samples are continuously cooled in ice-water.Centrifuge homogenate for 30 min, 4 °C, 4,300 x g (Heraeus centrifuge) and discard pellet (cell debris).Transfer supernatant to an ultracentrifuge-tube and pellet membranes at 100,000 x g, 4 °C for 60 min (Beckman L-60 centrifuge).Decant supernatant, take up membranes (pellet) in 1-2 ml membrane-buffer and gently suspend in a homogenizer (Dounce Tissue Grinder). Transfer the membrane preparation into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.",
    "Note: The amount of membrane-buffer to be used depends on the size of the pellet. Suspend a pellet of approximately 1 cm in diameter at the bottom of the centrifuge tube in 2 ml membrane-buffer. Freeze membrane preparation in liquid N2 and store at -80 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170116/20170116023502_1710.jpgFigure 2. Short French press protocol. A. Equipment of the French Pressure Cell; B. Aminco French Pressure Cell (taken out of the fridge 4 °C); C. Attention! Before use: Grease the O-rings and back-up rings of the stamp with glycerol! Insert the stamp into the cell body so that the inner cell body surface is covered with glycerol as well! D. Place the cell body with the stamp upside down into the stand with the opening facing upwards. E. Place the flow valve into the hole. F. Fill in the cell solution (looks milky). G. Put the lid on top. H. Close the flow valve. I. Place the French Pressure Cell into the gadget and… (J) close the bracket. K. Start the French press by turning the hand gear on ‘high’ and (L) switch on the pump. M. When the French press set up 1,100 psi… (N) open carefully the flow valve such that… (O) a flow drop by drop is visible. P. Attention! Stop in time so you can easily open the bracket and the stamp does not hit the ground! Q. When you are done, flip the switch to ‘down’ and turn on the pump again. The hydraulic lift moves down and you can take out the French Pressure Cell. R. Your cells are lysed properly when you can see the scale through the tube. S. Put your sample back on ice for the next step."
