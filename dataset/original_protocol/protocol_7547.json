    "Design of gRNA and ssODN Identify desired locus of HiBiT tag insertion (for example at the C- or N-terminal end, directly after the start codon or right before the stop codon).Identify appropriate gRNA sequences within ± 30 nucleotides of locus of insertion; for improved result, compare gRNA efficiency over various publicly available algorithms (we have not tested gRNA sequences more than 30 nt away from the site of insertion).Design ssODN with at least 80 nucleotides homology arms upstream and downstream of Cas9 cut site (total length of ssODN is 180–200 nt).To prevent Cas9 from binding to and cutting the ssODN, insert 2–3 silent mutations into the gRNA sequence within the ssODN, preferentially the PAM sequence if possible.Table 1.

    "blue: HiBiT tag; orange: sgRNA sequence; red: Stop codon; green: PAM sequence; purple: silent mutations inserted to prevent Cas9 from binding to ssODNElectroporation Prepare stock solutions:Cas9: 20 μMsgRNA: 50 μMssODN: 100 μMIn a total volume of 7 μL, add 15 pmol of Cas9 and 75 pmol of sgRNA to buffer R or T (depending on the cell type, see NeonTM instructions).Note: The ratio between sgRNA and Cas9 can be empirically titrated for best efficiency. We recommend a ratio of 5:1–9:1. Example, per reaction:1.5 μL of sgRNA (75 pmol)0.75 μL of Cas9 (15 pmol)4.75 μL of buffer R or TIncubate for 15 min at RT. RNP complexes are stable for 1 h at RT.Note: RNPs can be complexed prior to the experiment and stored for two weeks at 4 °C or up to at least 10 weeks at -80 °C without loss in performance. Prepare a 96-well plate with 100 μL of growth medium (suitable for your cell type) containing 30 μM of HDR enhancer to collect cells after electroporation. Prewarm to 37 °C.Add 75 pmol of ssODN (0.75 μL of 100 μM stock) to the complexed RNPs.Wash in PBS.Prepare the electroporator station: fill electroporation tube with 3 mL of buffer E. Settings vary depending on the cell line, and optimized settings and cell numbers for many cell lines can be found at Thermo Fisher (https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-transfection-system/neon-transfection-system-cell-line-data.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-transfection-system/neon-transfection-system-cell-line-data.html]).Count cells, take the appropriate cell number, and resuspend in 5 μL of buffer R or T per electroporation, including appropriate controls (electroporation only, untargeted sgRNA).Add 5 μL of cell suspension to 7 μL of RNP complex. Keep cell exposure to buffers R or T at a minimum (≤ 15 min).Using a 10 μL NeonTM electroporation tip, electroporate cells and transfer into prewarmed media (step B4).",
    "Transfer cells to a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 immediately.Do not disturb cells for 24 h.After 24 h, electroporation efficiency can be assessed visually by examining the presence of eCas9-GFP in live cells using a fluorescent microscope. Handle plate with care and avoid extended exposure to ambient temperature.Check for HiBiT insertion Let cells grow until you can comfortably remove 5 × 104 cells.Prepare Nano-Glo® HiBiT lytic detection reagent by allowing buffer to thaw to RT.Note: This assay can be performed in various well formats. We prefer using the 384-well format and adding 20 μL of detection reagent to 20 μL of cell suspension. For statistical reasons, we recommend performing the assay in no less than triplicates. Dilute assay reagents into assay buffer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Count cells and add equal numbers of cells per well.Note: We use 15,000 cells per 384-well plate. Add detection reagent and ensure homogeneous lysis by pipetting up and down. Be sure to include a no-HiBiT-expressing negative control.Equilibrate to RT for 10 min.Measure luminescence.Monoclonal population In case editing efficiency or endogenous protein expression is very low, single-cell monoclonal populations can be obtained through limiting dilution assay.To improve efficiency in growing edited monoclonal populations, we recommend preselecting HiBiT-expressing populations grown from 10 cells and performing limiting dilution assay after preselection.Of edited bulk population, plate 10 cells/well in a 96-well format.After enough cells have grown, screen populations for highest HiBiT expression using Nano-Glo® HiBiT lytic detection.From the highest expressing populations, perform limiting dilution assay.Grow and screen monoclonal populations.HiBiT blotting (optional) To ensure the HiBiT insertion has occurred at the correct protein, the size of the fusion protein can be tested via blotting.Isolate protein using the lysis buffer for HiBiT blotting (see Recipes) and quantify protein content (e.g., Bradford assay).",
    "Separate the appropriate volume of protein for the expected protein expression on a gel (e.g., 4%–20% Mini-PROTEAN® TGC Stain-FreeTM protein gel) and include a molecular weight marker.If using stain-free gel technology, activate gel according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Transfer protein onto a nitrocellulose membrane (e.g., via semi-dry Turbo-Blot transfer).After transfer, wash membrane in TBS-T (see Recipes). Do not allow membrane to dry.Acquire total protein image to allow for relative quantification.Prepare Nano-Glo® HiBiT blotting solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions: dilute LgBiT protein 200-fold with 1× Nano-Glo® blotting buffer, mix by inversion, remove TBS-T, and cover the membrane in blotting solution.Incubate for 1 h at RT while gently rocking.Note: For increased signal, incubation can be prolonged up to overnight incubation at 4 °C. If incubating at 4 °C, allow equilibration to RT before adding the substrate after incubation. Dilute the Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay Substrate 500-fold into the solution covering the membrane.Incubate for 5 min at RT.Acquire chemiluminescent image using an appropriate imager (e.g., ChemiDoc XRS+).Note: As an alternative to the HiBiT blotting system, a conventional immunoblot can be performed using Promega’s mouse anti-HiBiT mAB (catalog number: N7200). Perform your experiment Quantify relative endogenous protein expression at desired time points using NanoGlo® HiBiT lytic detection (Figure 2), Nano-Glo® HiBiT blotting system (Figure 3), or conventional immunoblot.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4777/bioprotoc-13-14-4777-g002.jpgFigure 2.
