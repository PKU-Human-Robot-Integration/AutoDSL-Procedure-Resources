    "1. Reprogramming Protocol\nGeneration of human iPSC from primary human pancreatic cells\nCoat a 6-well plate with 1.5 mg/mL cold collagen and allow it to gel at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPlate early passage human primary pancreatic cells in Prigrow III medium (~1 - 1.5 × 105 cells) on a collagen coated 6-well plate on day -2 to achieve approximately 2.5 × 105 cells or at least 60% confluency per well on the day of transduction (day 0). For the first study, plate at least 2 - 3 wells to get one well with desired confluency on day 0. Use at least one well as a control to count the cells.\nOn the day of transduction (day 0), warm 1 mL of Prigrow III medium in a water bath for each well to be transduced. Harvest the cells from one control well in 1 mL of 10% FBS medium using 1 mL of trypsin/EDTA for 5 min or till the cells detach to perform a cell count. To make 10% FBS medium, add DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, 1% Sodium Pyruvate and 1% non-essential amino acids.\nCount and check the viability of the cells using the cell counter and calculate the volume of each virus needed to reach the target based on the cell number and virus titer. Use multiplicity of infection (MOI) of KOS = 5, hc-Myc = 5 and hKlf4 = 3 for the pancreatic cells.",
    "Thaw one set of Sendai vector tubes in the -80 °C storage on ice and carefully add the calculated volumes of each of the three Sendai vector tubes to 1 mL of Prigrow III medium, pre-warmed to 37 °C. Pipette gently to mix the solution. One well in a 6-well plate is enough for transducing with Sendai viral vectors to generate reprogrammed cells.\nAspirate the Prigrow III medium from the cells, and slowly add the reprogramming virus mixture to the wells containing the cells. Incubate the cells overnight in a 37 °C incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nCarefully discard the virus mixture on cells and replace with fresh Prigrow III medium the next day, 24 h after transduction. Culture the cells for 5 d and change the medium every alternate day.\nOn day 5, prepare MEFs on 0.1% gelatin pre-coated 10 cm culture dishes (1.3 x106 cells/dish). Grow MEFs in T175 flasks till day 4 and then on day 5, expose the cells to 6,000 rads from a γ-radiation source before seeding the cells13 or use the commercial MEF source.\nOn day 6, use 1 mL of cell detachment solution for 10 min to detach the transduced cells, plate all of them on MEF dishes in Prigrow III medium with rock inhibitor (5 mM stock, 10 µM final) and incubate overnight in a 37 °C incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nChange the Prigrow III medium to hESC medium the next day. For making 500 mL of hESC medium, add DMEM/F-12, 20% (v/v) knockout serum replacement (KOSR), 5 ng/mL bFGF; 1 mM l-glutamine; 100 µM nonessential amino acids and 100 µM 2-mercaptoethanol. Change the medium gently every day now.",
    "Observe the plates regularly for the emergence of cell clumps or colonies indicative of reprogrammed cells. The transformed cells form clonal aggregates with cobblestone morphology and big nucleus and nucleoli. Mark the probable 'iPSC' colonies and check them regularly for growth.\nAlmost four weeks after transduction as colonies are ready for picking or transfer, prepare 24-well MEF plates by plating 1.3 x 106 cells/gelatin pre-coated plate as before for the transfer of single colonies.\nPrepare matrix membrane (e.g., Matrigel) by aliquoting it based on the dilution factor on the certificate of analysis. Add one aliquot to 25 mL of DMEM/F-12 to coat four 6-well plates (1 mL/well) and incubate at room temperature (RT) for at least 1 h before use. Manually pick 12-24 colonies by using a sterile pipette-tip to aspirate them and transfer onto MEF plates in 500 µL of hESC medium.\nAspirate the media in the well to gently disrupt or break apart the colonies. Also pick 24-48 colonies on matrix membrane coated 24-well plates. For the membrane coated plates, use mTeSR1 (supplemented with 10 µM rock inhibitor) for 24 h and change every day. Within 6-10 d of picking colonies, they are ready to be transferred to the new 24-well and/or 12-well membrane plates for clonal expansion.\nIf needed, detach the colonies on MEFs using 1 mg/mL collagenase for 20 min, wash twice with hESC/mTeSR1 and transfer to membrane coated 12- or 24-well plates. If there are enough robust colonies growing on the matrix membrane from step 1.1.12, freeze the colonies on MEFs using iPSC freezing media as per the manufacturer's guidelines.",
    "Detach the robust colonies plated on the membrane in step 1.1.12 using 500 µL of dispase for 20 min and plate again on matrix membrane coated 12-well plates. Manually scrape off any differentiated cells or contaminating MEF feeder cells to enrich for pluripotent clones on the membrane.\nExpand the clones after 6-8 d by growing on membrane coated plates by dissociating with dispase solution as before and plating small cell aggregates on fresh membrane coated 6- or 12-well plate. Change mTeSR1 medium daily. Characterize the reprogrammed clones by alkaline phosphatase staining, immunostaining for pluripotency markers (OCT3/4 and NANOG), FACS analysis of pluripotent surface markers and differentiation assays. Grow and culture the clones on membrane-coated plates for all the assays including CRISPR editing as explained above unless other coating solution is specifically mentioned.\nCharacterization of Human iPSCs\nAlkaline Phosphatase staining\n\t\tNOTE: A commercial kit is used here. See the Materials Table.\n\t\t\nPlate putative human iPSCs on 24-well plate and culture for 4-5 d with daily media change.\nTo start the staining protocol, aspirate the culture medium and wash the cells with 1 mL of 1x PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST).\nAdd 0.5 mL of fix solution in the kit on the cells and incubate at RT for 2 to 5 min. Aspirate the fix solution and then wash the fixed cells with PBST. Do not allow the wells to dry.\nAdd 0.5 mL of freshly prepared AP Substrate Solution per well by mixing solution A, B and C. Incubate the cells in the dark (wrapped with foil or in a dark container) at room temperature for 5 to 15 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Closely monitor the color change and stop the reaction when the color turns bright to avoid non-specific staining.",
    "Stop the reaction by aspirating the AP Substrate Solution and washing the wells twice with 2 mL of 1x PBS.\nObserve the colonies under the microscope and capture the images at 4X or 10X magnification using any bright field microscope with a camera.\nImmunostaining\n\t\t\nPlate human iPSCs in 24-well plate and culture for 4-5 d with daily media change.\nWash cells once briefly with PBS and fix for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.\nWash three times for 10 min (3x, 10 min) with PBS at RT.\nSaturate non-specific sites with 10% normal goat or donkey serum (NS, depending on the animal secondary antibody was raised in) in PBS for 40 min at RT. For only intracellular epitopes, include 0.3% TX-100 in PBS (TX/PBS) to permeabilize.\nWash 3x5 min with PBS at RT.\nDilute the OCT4, NANOG, TUJ1, NKX2-5 and SOX17 antibodies in a fresh solution of 5% NS in PBS and incubate for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C.\nWash 3x for 5 min with PBS at RT.\nDilute appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 antibodies in 5% NS/PBS and incubate cells for 1 h at RT.\nWash 3x for 5 min at RT.\nIncubate with DAPI in PBS for 10 min and wash 2x for 5 min at RT. Use a fluorescent microscope to take pictures.\nFluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)\n\t\t\nPlate human iPSCs in a 6-well plate and culture till the colonies become 80% confluent (at least 105 cells /sample) with daily mTeSR1 medium change.\nOn the day of the experiment, isolate the cells and dissociate to a single cell suspension as explained above in the protocol. Wash with 10% FBS medium.\nFor surface markers, resuspend in 0.5-1 mL of 10% FBS medium and keep on ice.",
    "For intracellular markers, resuspend in 1 mL of 4% PFA/PBS and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Wash with 10% FBS medium. Resuspend in 0.1% TX/PBS and incubate for 15 min on ice. Wash again with 10% FBS medium. Resuspend in 0.5-1 mL of 10% FBS medium and keep on ice.\nAdd 50 µL of the cell suspension to 50 µL of 10% FBS medium containing recommended amount of TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81 or SSEA-4 antibodies and incubate for 30 min to 1 h.\nWash twice with 10% FBS.\nResuspend in 100 µL of 10% FBS medium containing fluorescent secondary antibodies and incubate for 30 min. Wash twice with 10% FBS and resuspend in appropriate volume of 10% FBS. The live cells can be differentiated from dead cells by propidium iodide dye added at <1 µg/mL to estimate cell apoptosis during the process.\nTri-lineage differentiation\nSeed two 6-well plates with 1.5-2 x 106 iPSCs/well in mTeSR1 medium with 10 µM rock inhibitor.\nAllow the cells to grow for 2-3 d with daily mTeSR1 medium change until the wells are 80-90% confluent.\nFor ectoderm induction, add neural induction medium (NIM) according to the manufacturer's instructions in 2-3 wells of the 6-well plates.\nChange the medium to RPMI containing 2% B27 supplement minus insulin and 12 µM CHIR99021 for mesoderm induction in 2-3 wells of the plates14. Add only RPMI containing 2% B27 supplement minus insulin for the next 24 h. Add 5 µM IWP4 to the RPMI medium with 2% B27 supplement minus insulin for the next 24 h. After 72 h, replace the media with RPMI containing 2% B27 supplement leading to the generation of beating cardiomyocytes in 2-3 d.",
    "For endoderm induction, change the medium in wells of the 6-well plates to MCDB 131 supplemented with 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 1x Glutamax, 10 mM glucose, 0.5% BSA, 100 ng/mL GDF8, and 5µM of CHIR99021 for 24 h. Culture in the same medium without CHIR99021 for 2-3 d15.\nFollow the immunostaining protocol from step 2 for all the three lineages and check for the expression of relevant markers.\n2. Genome Editing of Human iPSC Using CRISPR-Cas9\nPreparation of Cas9 protein and sgRNA\nAliquot Cas9 protein into microcentrifuge tubes in sterile conditions and store the aliquots by freezing the tubes at -80 °C.\nDesign two targeting guide RNAs per gene based on the software from MIT (http://www.genome-engineering.org/crispr/) or any other CRISPR guide design webtool. Target first or second exon of the gene (based on open reading frame) to generate knockouts. Choose the two guides so that they cut close together (~30-100 bp apart) and we can easily visualize the deletion using the same set of screening primers. Choose the guides from the software output on the basis of higher quality score and lower number of off-target sites. Design screening primers using the program primer blast (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/). Screening primers should be at least 100 bp away from the Cas9 cut sites and the PCR product size should preferably be between 400-700 bp for easier amplification by PCR.",
    "Design the two complementary sgRNA oligo DNAs (19-22 nucleotides in length depending on the guide sequence) with a Bsa1 cut site at each end. The oligo DNAs can be synthesized commercially and annealed to form double-strand DNA. For annealing, add 1 µL each of 100 µM guides, 25 µL of annealing buffer (10 mM Tris, pH7.5-8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) and 23 µL of water. Incubate in a thermocycler programmed to start at 95 °C for 2 min and then gradually cooling to 25 °C over 45 min.\nClone the 2 µL of resulting fragment into a Bsa1 restriction enzyme digested 1 µL of in-house T7 promoter pCR2.1 vector with a Cas9 binding site using T4 DNA ligase as per the manufacturer's protocol.\nSequence the cloned DNA fragments and when fidelity is established, in vitro transcribe the clones using a T7 kit to generate single guide RNAs. Purify the sgRNAs with a commercial kit and elute in RNase-free water. Check the RNA concentration.\nTransfection of hiPSCs\nCulture hiPSCs in mTeSR1 medium as described above until the cells are 40-50% confluent.\nTwo hours before nucleofection, replace the medium with 2 mL of prewarmed mTeSR1 medium containing 10 µM rock inhibitor.\nOne hour later, prepare destination wells for nucleofected cells by aspirating membrane, prepared as above, from 12-well plate and replacing with prewarmed 1 mL of mTeSR1 medium with 10 µM rock inhibitor. Keep at 37 °C for incubation.",
    "Prepare nucleofection master mix (scale appropriately depending on the samples) for each sample by adding 16.4 µL of P3 primary cell supplement; 3.6 µL of Supplement 1 from the nucleofector kit; 0.5 µg of Cas9 protein and 0.5 µg of each sgRNA in 22 µL per reaction volume. pMAX GFP vector was also nucleofected as per the manufacturer's recommendations in cells to roughly estimate the efficiency of iPSC transfection.\nWash each well with 2 mL of RT PBS after aspirating the medium containing rock inhibitor from the iPSC wells. Then aspirate PBS, add 1 mL of cell detachment solution, and incubate the plate at 37 °C for 10 min.\nResuspend the cells in 3 mL of mTeSR1 medium and gently pipette up and down to generate a single-cell suspension. Transfer dissociated cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 5 mL mTeSR1 medium.\nCount cells with cell counter and calculate total volume required for 0.5 x 106 cells/transfection. Place desired quantity of cells in 15-mL centrifuge tube, centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at RT and aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend each unit of 0.5 x 106 cells in 22 µL of the transfection master mix prepared in step 4. Quickly transfer cells into the central chamber of one well of a nucleocuvette strip. Place the strip into a nucleofector device and nucleofect cells using program CB150.\nAfter nucleofection, quickly add 80 µL of prewarmed mTESR1 medium containing 10 µM rock inhibitor to each well of the nucleofected cells. Gently mix by pipetting up and down.\nGently transfer cells from the strip to wells of the membrane pre-coated 12-well plate containing mTeSR1 medium with rock inhibitor prepared in step 3.\nAfter 1 d, change to fresh mTeSR1 medium without rock inhibitor. Harvest cells 2-3 d after nucleofection for single-cell sorting.",
    "Single-Cell Isolation of targeted hiPSCs\nOne day before the sorting, prepare 96-well MEF plates by seeding 2 x 106 cells/gelatin-coated plate in 10% FBS medium. Approximately 70-80% of the clones survive after nucleofection and 2-3 MEF plates can be prepared for each editing experiment.\nFollowing the overnight incubation, change the medium to hESC medium (as described previously) supplemented with 100 ng/mL bFGF, 1x SMC4 (inhibitors added to the media to enhance single cell viability), and 5 mg/mL fibronectin to promote adhesion.\nReplace the medium on the hiPSCs in the 12-well plate from mTeSR1 to mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 1x SMC4 for at least 2 h before single cell sorting.\nAspirate the medium from hiPSCs and wash the cells gently with PBS. Add 500 µL of cell detachment solution in each well and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min after aspirating the PBS. Generate the single-cell suspension by adding 1 mL of mTeSR1 (unsupplemented) to each well and pipetting up and down gently several times.\nPlace cell suspension in a 15-mL conical tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 200 x g at RT. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of mTeSR1.\nSort the cells in single cells using a cell sorter with 100 mm nozzle under sterile conditions with one cell in the individual well of the 96-well plates prepared in step 1.\nFour days after sorting, colony formation should be apparent; at this point replace the culture medium with hESC medium supplemented with 1x SMC4.\nEight days after sorting, replace medium with hESC medium and culture for 2 d.",
    "Detach the colonies using 1 mg/mL collagenase for 20 min and transfer them to 24-well membrane coated plates in mTeSR1 with rock inhibitor. Let the single-cell clones grow and extract their genomic DNA after duplicating or expanding them. Use gene specific primers to amplify the target DNA by PCR.\nUse fragment analyzer kit for initial screening of PCR amplified target genomic region of all clones by running them through the gel/dye mix as per the manufacturer's instructions. Estimate the resulting fragment size in the software PROSize by comparing it with the appropriate ladder, which is run with the samples. Sequence the expected 'edited' clones and analyze sequencing data to confirm the editing or deletions.\nFor differentiating monoallelic and biallelic clones, amplify the edited sequence with PCR and clone in pJET1.2 vector. Send at least 8-10 clones for sequencing and check the sequence to confirm editing in one or both alleles.\nOnce successfully targeted iPSC clones have been identified through genotyping, examine to confirm that they have not lost pluripotency or gained chromosomal abnormalities through the process.\nSubscription Required.
