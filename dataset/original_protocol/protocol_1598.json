    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRecruit and screen patients\nTiming: 0.5 days for each potential participant\nInform the study-related information to the potential participants, and if they are willing to participate, prepare the written consent and ask the participant to sign it.\nContact the interested subjects by telephone to initially screen the potential patients. At this stage, the following details of subjects will be obtained: the type of drugs they used, their age and gender, and whether they suffer from neuropsychiatric diseases.\nFor patients who meet the requirements of the initial screening (i.e., use methamphetamine in the past 3 months; male; aged 18–49 years old; no serious neuropsychiatric diseases), invite them to conduct the face-to-face interviews, provide them information about the research, and answer potential questions.\nIf patients who meet the research eligibility criteria are willing to participate (Seventy-four patients in this study, the sample size calculation methods please refer to Chen et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), provide the written consent form to the patients, and create their individual records after they have signed it.\nCritical: The inclusion criteria are: (1) met the DSM-5 criteria for severe methamphetamine use disorder; (2) aged 18–49 years old; (3) normal vision and audition; (4) received no medications during treatment; (5) used methamphetamine in the past 3 months before being recruited in this study. The exclusion criteria are: (1) serious physical or neurological illness, a diagnosis of any other psychiatric disorder under DSM-5 criteria (except for nicotine use disorder); (2) any contraindications to rTMS.\nCreate individual record\nTiming: 10 min for each potential participant\nCreate a treatment record sheet for each patient and record the treatment process and adverse effects during the treatment.",
    "Before starts treatment, a treatment document for each subject will be created. The contents of the document mainly include information such as the intensity of the intervention, the mode of the intervention, the date of the intervention. This can be recorded by the operator before and after treatment.\nIndividual adverse effect record sheets should also be prepared, which are used to record the type, intensity as well as time of adverse effects that occurred during the intervention.\nCritical: The possible adverse effects including headache, dizzy, tinnitus, facial discomfort, jaw tremble, insomnia, somnolence, and epilepsy.\nCritical: Most adverse effects disappear gradually after stopping the stimulation. In the adverse reaction record, we also ask the patients to score their discomfort feeling (0–9). \"0\" means no adverse effect, and \"9\" means the adverse effect is severe, and the stimulation needs to be stopped. When the score reaches 5–8 points, it is recommended to consider reducing the current stimulation intensity by about 5% per time until the subject can tolerate the stimulation. When the score reaches 9 points, it is recommended to stop the treatment.\nAssessment of craving level (baseline)\nTiming: approximately 5 min (for 1 participant)\nAssess the participant’s cue-induced craving scores at baseline using visual analog scale.\nInstruct the subjects to watch the methamphetamine-related figures for 5 min and let the patients to recall the last time they used methamphetamine.\nPatients report their craving level. The scores are ranging from 0 (i.e., no craving) to 100 (i.e., highest craving intensity ever experienced for methamphetamine).\nMeasurement of resting motor threshold\nTiming: 20 min for each participant\nEvaluating the resting motor threshold of each subject is one of the prerequisites for setting treatment parameters.\nSettings for the instrument used for evaluation.",
    "Transcranial magnetic stimulator: choose the single pulse stimulation mode and the coil is MCF-B70 coil.\nEMG recorder: The EMG recorder should connect to the EMG recording line, which has three electrode patches (two for EMG recording and one for grounding), the EMG signals are analog bandpass filtered between 5 and 500 Hz. The sampling rate is 1000 Hz.\nCritical: The coil used for the determination of the resting motor threshold should be consistent with the coil used in the later intervention. As mentioned above, since different coils have different effects when target to same brain area, the use of the same coil can ensure that the intensity of the subsequent intervention is closer to the expected.\nThe coil targets the motor cortex and moves weakly during stimulation to find the correct location (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The electrode patches are placed on the right abductor pollicis brevis muscles and the thenar eminence position (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).

The minimum stimulation intensity that can produce 5 motor-evoked potentials responses of at least 50μV in 10 stimulation is the resting motor threshold of the subject.",
    "Note: To identify the areas of motor cortex, mark the vertex of the brain firstly by measuring the mid-point intersection between the nasion-inion and inter-aural lines. For the right abductor pollicis brevis, position the coil 1–2 cm laterally to the right area of the vertex and 1–2 cm posterior initially. The stimulation coil position should be adjusted for each subject to the area that induced motor-evoked potentials with maximal amplitude.\nAccording to existing studies, the resting motor threshold of most people is range between 30 and 50% of the output power of the TMS machine. Therefore, the stimulation starts from 40%, and gradually increases or decreases the intensity of the stimulation. Finally, the resting motor threshold is determined.\nNote: In order to improve the efficiency of the operation, the intensity is suggested to increase by 2% each time when increasing. When the approximate range of the target intensity is determined, the intensity is reduced by 1% each time for fine-tuning.\nNote: The minimum stimulation intensity that can produce five motor-evoked potentials responses of at least 50 microvolts (μV) in ten stimulation is the resting motor threshold of the subject (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nPositioning and coil placement\nTiming: 10 min for each participant\nBefore the intervention, it is necessary to locate the stimulation target based on the 10–20 EEG system and position the coil on the head.\nTwo treatment parameters are stored in the stimulator for use in subsequent interventions. The first one is the stimulation parameters targeting DLPFC, and the second one is the stimulation parameters targeting VMPFC.",
    "Identify the position of the stimulation site: Before each stimulation session, the subjects take a sitting position and wear an EEG cap. The EEG international 10–20 system will be used to identify the stimulation position (Fp1 for left VMPFC and F3 for left DLPFC) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1162-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The targeting area based on EEG International 10–20 system positioning\n(A) F3 electrode for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;\n(B) Fp1 electrode for left ventromedial prefrontal cortex. DLPFC = dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, VMPFC = ventromedial prefrontal cortex.\nCritical: It is necessary to select an EEG cap with a suitable size for each subject and wear it accurately. Generally, there are no very strict criteria for this, but at least two points should be met: (1) the subjects have no discomfort; (2) the cap is not too loose to cause the cap to shift during operation. This can ensure the accuracy of the stimulation position as much as possible.\nPlacement of the stimulation coil: After determining the position of the stimulation, the stimulation coil needs to be placed correctly and the position of the coil must be fixed.\nNote: For left VMPFC, the coil is rather placed on the nasal bridge so that the imaginary straight lower margin of the coil is centrally positioned on FP1 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The distance between the upper edge of the coil and the upper forehead is about 2 cm. The handle of the coil is turned upward to be tangent to the head and point towards the top of the head.\nNote: For left DLPFC, the coil is held tangential to the participant's head and the coil is centrally positioned on F3 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). When performing sham stimulation intervention, the stimulation coil is randomly target on the DLPFC stimulation position or VMPFC stimulation position.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1162-Fig5.jpg",
    "Figure 5. Schematic diagram of the positioning of the coil targeting the ventromedial prefrontal cortex\nThe coil is centered over Fp1, a location approximating the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1162-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Schematic diagram of the positioning of the coil targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nThe coil is centered over F3, a location approximating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nTreatment process\nTiming: 20–30 min for each participant\nAfter setting the parameters and positioning, each subject will be stimulated separately. In addition, the operator needs to observe the patient's feelings during the intervention.\nAll the subjects will be allocated to one of the four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio according to the random number table by an independent study researcher. All subjects will receive ten sessions of treatment in two weeks (one session/day and five days/week).\nAsk the subject to lie on the chair (shown as the Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) in a separate room and prepare to intervene. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nCritical: The main purpose of intervention in a separate room is to ensure the implementation of blinding.\nBefore starting the formal stimulation, place a thin PE foam sheet (thickness = 0.5 mm) between the coil and the stimulated brain position to reduce the potential discomfort caused by the stimulation.\nWhen everything is ready, start to stimulate. The stimulation intensity is first set to 80% of the rMT, and it is gradually increased to the specified stimulation intensity during the stimulation process (100% rMT when stimulating DLPFC, and 110% rMT when stimulating VMPFC). In doing so, the patient's tolerance to the stimulation can be improved. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]",
    "For the combined stimulation group, after completing the intervention of one targeting site, it takes about 5 min to complete the replacement of the stimulation coil and reset the stimulation parameters, and then start the stimulation of another targeting site. Two treatment protocols are randomly assigned to the subjects. The stimulation process is the same as above.\nCritical: During the stimulation process, the subject’s head needs to be kept still to ensure that the stimulation position is accurate. It is recommended that an operator could watch by the side, if there is obvious head movement, the operator could help to adjust the head position.\nCritical: When performing sham stimulation intervention, the stimulation parameter is randomly set to DLPFC stimulation parameters or VMPFC stimulation parameter, but the stimulation coil uses P-B-70 coil.\nRecord the treatment process\nTiming: 10 min for each participant\nDuring the treatment, the operator records the details of the treatment process and asks the subjects about the adverse effects. If it is needed, make timely adjustments to treatment arrangements, including parameter adjustments or discontinuing the treatment.\nAfter the treatment is completed, record the stimulation intensity of the patient's current treatment and the time to complete the treatment.\nRecord the patient's adverse effect, the time point of the adverse effect, and the severity of the adverse effect.",
    "Critical: The adverse effects (e.g., headache, dizzy, facial discomfort, and insomnia) may be that the patient has not yet fully adapted to the intensity of the stimulation. In this case, by reducing 5%–10% of the stimulation intensity, the adverse effect could usually be solved. For those who still have obvious adverse effect after reducing the stimulation intensity, it is recommended to suspend the intervention. The solution could be to stop the intervention for 1–2 days and then restart the stimulation. Our research (unpublished data) has found that some subjects no longer have adverse effect in the follow-up treatment. Another solution is to ask the patient whether to withdraw from the study and provide other help to them.\nCritical: For the subject with serious adverse events (e.g., epilepsy), it is recommended to stop the stimulation immediately and contact the doctor for further treatment. However, it should be clarified that, according to the current studies, the probability of serious adverse events caused by TMS intervention is low.\nAssessment of craving level (post-treatment)\nTiming: approximately 5 min each time (for 1 participant)\nEvaluate the participants’ cue-induced craving scores during and after the treatment using visual analog scale. It is assessed at post 1/2 week of intervention, post 1 week of intervention, post 3/2 weeks of intervention, and post 2 weeks of intervention.\nInstruct the subjects to watch the methamphetamine-related figures for 5 min and let the patients to recall the last time they used methamphetamine.\nPatients report their craving level. The scores are ranging from 0 (i.e., no craving) to 100 (i.e., highest craving intensity ever experienced for methamphetamine)."
