    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPre-coat well plates with anti-γδTCR mAb\nTiming:  > 2 h\nThis section describes how to pre-coat well plates with mouse anti-γδTCR antibody.\nPrepare antibody mix by adding 25 μL anti-γδTCR antibody (clone UC7, 0.25 mg/mL) into 6.25 mL sterile PBS, and mix well. The final concentration is 1 μg/mL.\nNote: For subsequent experiments, we need to pre-coat 24 wells in total.\nAdd 250 μL antibody mix per well in a 24-well plate (MIDSCI).\nPlace the plate into a 37°C incubator and incubate at least 2 h or overnight.\nIsolate mouse peripheral lymph nodes and prepare single-cell suspensions\nTiming: 45 min\nThis section describes how to harvest peripheral lymph nodes from mice and followed by single-cell suspension preparation.\nEuthanize the mouse (C57BL/6J, 6–8 weeks, female or male) according to the local ethical policy and animal welfare regulations (e.g., CO2). Spray the mouse with 70% ethanol and fix the animal with dissecting pins in a flat styrofoam.\nNote: For subsequent experiments, we need to harvest lymph nodes from 3–4 mice.\nCut the skin longitudinally along the abdominal midline and open the skin along limbs with scissors.\nCritical: Keeping the peritoneum intact during processing will help operative field exposure.\nHarvest the cervical, brachial, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes from the locations shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Put those peripheral lymph nodes into ice-cold complete RPMI 1640 medium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2945-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Locations of mouse peripheral cervical, brachial, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes\nPlace a 40 μm cell strainer in a petri dish and rinse with sterile PBS.\nTransfer the lymph nodes into the cell strainer and grind with a syringe plunger. Use 5–10 mL RPMI 1640 medium to pass through the strainer and transfer the medium to a 15 mL tube.",
    "Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL complete RPMI 1640 medium to resuspend the pellet and count the cells using hemacytometer.\nNote: The estimated cell number of lymphocytes from lymph nodes of each mouse ranges from 15 to 25 million. Different strains of mice, such as BALB/c, may show different yields.\nCulture lymphocytes with IL-1β and IL-23 in the pre-coated 24-well plate\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes how to resuspend lymphocytes in culture medium which contains rmIL-1β (10 ng/mL) and rmIL-23 (10 ng/mL), and seed cells in the pre-coated 24-well plate.\nPrepare culture medium as described in “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].”\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant. Adjust the cell concentration to 2 million/mL with the pre-warmed culture medium and mix well.\nDiscard the PBS from the pre-coated 24-well plate.\nAdd 1 mL of the above single cell suspension per well and gently shake the plate to make the cells evenly distributed.\nCritical: The primary CD27− γδ T cell line can survive for up to 7–8 days.\nIntracellular ATP delivery with ATP vesicles\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes how to reconstitute ATP and control vesicles, and treat lymphocytes with vesicles at appropriate concentrations.\nPrepare freshly reconstituted ATP and control vesicles as described in “ATP and control vesicle reconstitution[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]” part.\nCritical: After reconstitution with complete RPMI 1640 medium, ATP vesicles need to be used within 2 days. Thus, prepare it freshly before experiments.\nAdd ATP and control vesicles at indicated concentrations (0, 1, 10, 20 μM) and mix well. Example of calculations is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2945-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(B) Representative images of γδ T cells treated with ATP and control vesicles under microscope. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nNote: Vesicles will settle to the bottom of wells and appears like white granules that cover cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The cells are bright and round at day 1. Cell aggregations will be formed over 72-h incubation.\nCulture for 72 h in a 37°C incubator and observe the culture solution daily.\nCritical: The 72-h incubation time is determined with primary γδ T cells. We did not observe any phenotype change under other conditions (24–48 h). Performing incubation time kinetics is necessary for other cell types.\nFunctional evaluation of γδ T cells by flow cytometry\nTiming: 8 h\nThis section describes how to evaluate IL-17 production from γδ T cells in ATP and Control vesicle treated cells with flow cytometry.\nAdd 1 μL Golgi-plug Brefeldin A (BFA, 1000×) per well to block transport processes and incubate for 4 h.\nCollect cells from each well into 15 mL conical tubes. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet in 150 μL of PBS.\nAdd 1 μL Fc Blocker per tube, mix well and incubate for 10 min at 4°C.\nDuring incubation, prepare diluted Viability dye and Flow antibody mix as described in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].”\nAdd 2 μL antibody mix per tube and incubate for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nWash by 1 mL PBS per tube. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 250 μL Fixation Buffer per tube and mix well. Incubate for 20 min at 25°C in the dark.\nDuring incubation, prepare 1× intracellular staining permeabilization wash buffer (1× wash buffer) as described in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].”",
    "Wash twice with 1 mL 1× wash buffer per tube, centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 150 μL of 1× wash buffer, add 0.5 μL anti-mouse IL-17 PE/Cy7 antibody per tube and mix well.\nIncubate for more than 2 h at 4°C in the dark.\nWash by 1 mL 1× wash buffer per tube, centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 300 μL 1× wash buffer and filter cell suspension with a 44 μm nylon mesh before analysis with Canto flow cytometer.\nSee Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A for the gating strategy with FlowJo software.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2945-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Functional evaluation of γδ T cells by flow cytometry\n(A) Representative gating strategy of live CD3+CD27−γδTCR+ cells and IL-17 production in γδ T cells.\n(B) Cells from adult peripheral lymph nodes were cultured with Control (Con) and ATP vesicles at indicated concentrations in the presence of IL-23 and IL-1β for 72 h and incubated with 1× BFA for 4 h. Intracellular IL-17 levels were measured by flow cytometry. Plots were gated on live CD3+γδTCR+ cells.
