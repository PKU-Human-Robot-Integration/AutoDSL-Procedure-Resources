  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The following procedures were approved by the head of department and meet all other institutional requirements.\n1. Pre-operative Computed Tomography\nNOTE: A helical computed tomography of the entire chest wall is taken following the local standards before the protocol begins.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52124/52124fig1highres.jpg\nFigure 1: Preoperative CT-Scan. (a) Axial view shows oblique and longitudinal fractures. (b) Sagittal view shows anterior-posterior dislocation or sternal kinking. (c) Coronal view gives an overview over oblique and longitudinal fractures. (d) Volume rendering technique (VRT) gives an overview over the entire anterior chest wall showing rib fractures, manubrium and corpus sterni fracture\nScan the chest wall for injuries. Inspect the complete anterior chest wall including examination of soft tissue, cartilage and bones.\n\t\nLook for bone fractures at the manubrium, corpus sterni and adjacent ribs I to VII on both sides. Look for cartilage disruption. Be aware of cartilage disruption and sternocostal separation not to miss any cause of instability.\nPerform a three dimensional evaluation. See the whole chest wall in the modus of three dimensional reconstructed pictures by evaluating each axial, coronal and sagittal picture in detail.\nPinpoint the fracture:\n\t\nTake the distance from the upper sternal edge (jugulum) to the fracture. Use the sagittal view for measuring.\nIn case of oblique fracture or multiple fractures measure both distances to jugulum, the cranial and the caudal edge of the fractures. Take the distance between those edges. The additional use of the coronal pictures might be helpful in this case.\nDetermine the thickness of presternal soft tissue. Evaluate and measure the thickness of presternal soft tissue at the point of the fracture.\nEstimate the length of the possible surgical incision, performed in the midline.",
    "NOTE: The basic approach needs to be at least 60 mm plus thickness of presternal soft tissue to get a proper access to a transverse fracture.\n\t\nIn case of oblique fracture or multiple fractures add the distance between the cranial and the caudal edge of the fractures to the basic approach.\n\t\tNOTE: There might be a need of a longer incision in obese patients, if there are scars in the determined region or for other reasons.\n2. Surgical Treatment\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52124/52124fig2highres.jpg\nFigure 2: Surgical approach. (a) Positioning on the back gives access to the entire anterior chest wall and both axles; chest tube were already inserted bilaterally in this case. (b) After drawing the landmarks such as jugulum and sternoclavicular joints (above) the midline is identified and the incision performed. Pectoral muscle was dissected from the anterior sternum. A raspatory is inserted subperiostally. (c) The approach gives full access to any fracture identified. In this case two transverse fractures are shown.\n2.1) Initial surgical procedures:\nPerform the operation under general anesthesia following the local standards while the patient is intubated. Place the patient in a supine position. Rest the arms on an arm board which must be placed less than 90° to the midline of the body and level the board with the floor. This might be useful if insertion of a chest tube becomes necessary.\nRemove superficial soil, debris, jewelry and transient microbes before applying antiseptic agents. Leave hair at the surgical site in place whenever possible.",
    "Commence disinfection following the local standards. Start from the cleanest area, usually the operative and/or incision site and proceed in a concentric fashion to the least clean area. Allow the disinfectant solution to dry completely naturally. Ensure that the antiseptic solution remains in contact with the skin for the required period of time as recommended by the manufacturer.\nSecure free access at least to the jugulum, the umbilicus and the axillary midline on both sides. Mark anatomical landmarks such as sternoclavicular joints on both sides, the upper sternal edge at the jugulum, the lower sternal edge and xiphoid, the seventh rib bilaterally and the umbilicus using a sterile pen.\n\t\nDraw the midline now between jugulum and umbilicus and mark the cranial and caudal edge of the fractures as measured in step 1.2. Add half of the basic approach cranial and the other half caudal to the edges of the fractured region of sternum.\nDouble check the correct position of the fracture(s) and of the midline, then perform the midline incision respecting the anatomical layers in soft tissue.\nRemove presternal haematoma by a vertical incision along the length of the haematoma and wash out as much as possible with 0.9% saline.\nCautiously take away the pectoral muscle bilaterally, beginning from the midline to the margin of the sternum whilst respecting the anatomical layers. Be aware of bleeding from smaller vessels and stop them. Identify the fracture.\nExpose the intercostal margin of the sternum, both, cranial and caudal of the fracture. Perform an incision of the sternal periosteum longitudinally along the front edge of the sternum. Cautiously dissect the periosteum from the bone laterally and on the posterior surface of the sternum using an elevatory or raspatory device.",
    "NOTE: Preparation very close to the bone during this procedure is very important to prevent injuries to the adjacent internal thoracic vessels and the mediastinum.\nExpose the fracture and clear the fracture cautiously. Usually retrosternal haematoma will appear at this time, wash out as much as possible with 0.9% saline.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52124/52124fig3highres.jpg\nFigure 3: Surgical safety. (a) Measuring the sternal thickness and insert an elevator device. (b, c) Depth limited drilling.\nMeasure the thickness of the sternum with a blunt instrument. Do not use a common “lot” due to possible retrosternal injuries. Prepare a drilling machine with a drill of the length of sternal thickness or shorter if not clear.\nReduce the bone fragments by elevating the posteriorly depressed fragments with an elevator device which can be inserted through the same subperiosteal approach shown in step 2.1.7. Assemble the laterally dislocated fragment should be by lateral compression. Use a pointed ball forceps, weller clamp or compression wires if necessary.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52124/52124fig4highres.jpg\nFigure 4: Fixation options of the plates. (a) Transverse fracture at corpus sterni: fixation with a pointed ball forceps and locked screws. (b) Oblique fracture at manubrium: reduction with compression wires , the first plate has been fixed yet. (c) Multiple transverse fracture; fixation of the plate using compression wires at the manubrium (above) and pointed ball forceps (below).\n2.2) Transverse fractures and oblique fractures of sternal body:\nMark the midline of the sternum using a pen or electrocautery.\nInsert a small pointed ball forceps to the posterior surface of the sternum using the intercostal space next to the fracture, again keeping very closed to the sternal bone. Use the intercostal space of the depressed fragment first.\n\t\nPut a longitudinal plate next to the midline and fix it with the pointed ball forcipes.",
    "NOTE: At least three screw holes of the plate should cover the cranial and the caudal main fragment. In case of a single fracture, a seven or eight-hole plate offers the correct fixation. Using longer plates is necessary in multiple fractures, where a longer distance needs to be fixed.\nFix the plate with locked screws, drilling each hole using a drilling guide and the drill as chosen under step 2.1.9 thus ensuring depth limited drilling and a secured locked fixation of each screw to the plate. Again, fix each main fragment with at least three screws.\nPut a second plate on the other side of the midline and repeat the steps 2.2.2-2.2.3.\n2.3) Longitudinal fractures, oblique manubrium fractures and sternocostal separation:\nReduce the fracture as shown under step 2.1.10.\nInsert one small pointed ball forceps to the posterior surface of the sternum on each side using the intercostal space next to the fracture, again keeping very close to the sternal bone. Put a transverse plate from rib to rib, bridging the sternum with its fragments and fix it with the pointed ball forcipes. Place at least three screw holes laterally of each fracture.\n\tNOTE: In case of a single fracture, a seven or eight- hole-plate offers the correct fixation. The use of longer plates usually becomes necessary for multiple fractures.\nFix the plate with locked screws; use a drilling guide and the drill as chosen under step 2.1.9 thus ensuring depth limited drilling. Again, fix each of the main fragments with at least three screws.\nFor osteosynthesis of each injured level, repeat steps 2.3.1-2.3.3.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52124/52124fig5highres.jpg",
    "Figure 5: Operative results. (a) Long parallel plates, each fragment was fixed with 3 screws. (b) Postoperative chest x-ray showing longitudinal sternal plate and three transverse plates fixing oblique manubrium fracture, sternocostal separation of second rib and fracture of third rib on the right side. (c) Lateral view of x-ray shows correct position of two parallel plates fixing a fracture located at sternal corpus.\nDouble check the correct position of all plates. Examine the anterior chest wall for sufficient stability. Look for any bleeding and stop it. Rule out pleural lesions. If a pleural lesion is indicated or suspected, insert a chest tube into the pleural cavity on the affected side using an axillary approach.\nInsert a subcutaneous drainage if necessary. Place the tube in front of the sternum and percutaneously divert about 5 cm away from the lower edge of the wound.\nClose the wound respecting the anatomical layers. Suture the periosteal incisions to preserve sternal blood supply. Approximation of the pectoral muscle to the midline is recommended to ensure a proper coverage of the implants with soft tissue.\nTake a chest x-ray after surgical treatment to rule out pneumothorax and hemothorax. The additional lateral view will show the position of the sternal fragments and of the implants."
