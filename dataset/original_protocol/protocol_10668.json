    "1. Preparation of Oxidized Porous SiO2\nEtch Si wafers (single side polished on the <100> face and heavily doped, p-type, 0.0008 Ω·cm) in a 3:1 (v/v) solution of aqueous HF and absolute ethanol for 30 sEC at a constant current density of 385 mA/cm2. Please note that HF is a highly corrosive liquid, and it should be handled with extreme care.\nRinse the surface of the resulting porous Si (PSi) film with absolute ethanol several times; dry the films under a dry nitrogen gas.\nOxidize the freshly-etched PSi samples in a tube furnace at 800 °C for 1 hr in ambient air (place the sample in the furnace at room temperature, heat the furnace to 800 °C, leave in furnace for 1 hr, turn off the furnace and remove the samples from the furnace only at room temperature).\n2. Biofunctionalization of PSiO2 Scaffolds\nIncubate an oxidized PSi (PSiO2) sample for 1 hr in mercaptopropyl(trimethoxysilane-3) 95% (MPTS) solution (108 mM in toluene).\nRinse the silane-treated PSiO2 sample with toluene, methanol, and acetone; dry under a dry nitrogen gas.\nIncubate the silane-modified PSiO2 sample for 30 min in 1 ml of 100 mM PEO-iodoacetyl biotin solution.\nRinse the biotin-treated PSiO2 sample with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution several times.\nIncubate the biotin-modified PSiO2 sample for 30 min in 1 ml of 100 μg/ml streptavidin (SA) solution.\nRinse the SA-treated PSiO2 sample with 0.1 M PBS solution several times.\nIncubate the resulting SA-modified PSiO2 sample for 30 min in 1 ml of 100 μg/ml biotinylated E. coli monoclonal antibody (Immunoglobulin G, IgG) solution or with 100 μg/ml biotinylated-rabbit IgG (as a model for a monoclonal antibody).\n3. Fluorescent Labeling and Fluorescence Microscopy",
    "Incubate the IgG-modified surfaces with 15 μg/ml fluorescein (FITC) tagged anti rabbit IgG for 40 min and with 15 μg/ml fluorescein (FITC) tagged anti mouse IgG as a control.\nRinse the modified samples with 0.1 M PBS solution several times.\nExamine the samples under a fluorescence microscope.\n4. Bacteria Culture\nCultivate E. coli K12 bacteria in a 10 ml tube with 5 ml of Luria Bertani (LB) medium (medium composition in 1 L of deionized water: 5 g of NaCl, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of tryptone). Incubate the bacteria overnight shaking at 37 °C.\nMonitor the bacteria concentration by reading the optical density (OD) at a wavelength of 600 nm. After overnight growth in LB medium, read the OD600 using a spectrophotometer to determine the bacterial concentration. The number of cells is directly proportional to the OD600 measurements (1 OD600 = 108 cells/ml).\n5. Bacteria Sensing\nPlace the IgG-modified PSiO2 and neat PSiO2 (as the control) samples in a custom-made Plexiglas flow cell. Fix the flow cell to ensure that the sample reflectivity is measured at the same spot during all the measurements.\nIncubate the samples with E. coli K12 suspension (104 cell/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Then remove the bacteria suspension by flushing the cell with 0.85% w/v saline solution for 30 min.\nMonitor the changes in the reflectivity data throughout the experiment. All optical measurements need to be carried out in an aqueous surrounding. Spectra should be collected using a CCD spectrometer and analyzed by applying fast Fourier transform (FFT), as previously described25,26 .\nConfirm the presence of the bacteria on the biosensor surface, by observation of the samples under an upright light microscope immediately after the biosensing experiment.\nSubscription Required.
