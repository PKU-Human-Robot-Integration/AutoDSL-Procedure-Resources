    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Keio University School of Medicine.\n1. Preparation of surgical instruments and animals\nAutoclave surgical instruments and keep them in 70% ethyl alcohol. Prior to each new surgical procedure, clean surgical instruments carefully using 70% ethyl alcohol.\nPrepare male BALB/cAJc1 mice (6 weeks old, 26-28 kg) in a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) room to maintain sterile conditions before, during and after the surgery.\n2. Transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (tBCCAO)\nPut a mouse under anesthesia via intraperitoneal injection with a combination of midazolam (40 μg/100 μL), medetomidine (7.5 μg/100 μL) and butorphanol tartrate (50 μg/100 μL), termed “MMB”, as previously described8,9. Hold the mouse’s back skins to keep the mouse away from bumping its eyes until the mouse is completely anesthetized.\n\t\nJudge the depth of anesthesia by pinching the mouse toe until it has no response, of which method is commonly used for checking complete anesthesia10.\n\t\tNOTE: Generally, less than 5 min are required for mice to fall asleep. Proper recipes for general anesthesia may be different by institutions.\nApply one drop of 0.1% purified sodium hyaluronate eye drop solution to the eyes to prevent dryness on the eyes under anesthesia.\nPlace the mouse on its back and fix the mouse's paws using adhesive tapes.\nDisinfect the neck area of the mouse using 70% ethyl alcohol before the surgery.\n\tNOTE: Additional clipping of the fur was not performed as this may cause subsequent skin inflammation11,12.\nPerform sagittal incision of the neck with a blade (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Incision needs to be made on the midline between the neck, sternum and trachea.\nSeparate both salivary glands carefully using two forceps and mobilize them to visualize the underlying CCAs.",
    "Isolate the right CCA carefully from the respective vagal nerves and accompanying veins without harming their structures, and place two 6-0 silk sutures under the CCA. Tie the two ties tightly to block the blood flow (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: During the procedure, small veins could be damaged. If bleeding is seen, wiping is required to visualize the CCAs clearly.\nFind the left CCA carefully from the respective vagal nerves and accompanying veins without harming their structures, and occlude the left CCA for 2 seconds by a clamp (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: A 6-0 silk suture needle is needed to be placed under the left CCA to mark a site for clamping.\nAfter reopening of the left CCA, suture wounds of the neck by a 6-0 silk suture and apply a dab of antibiotic (50 μL) onto the neck to inhibit bacterial infection.\n\tNOTE: Softly remove a clamp to avoid damaging the arterial wall when reopening of the left CCA.\nInject 0.75 mg/kg of atipamezole hydrochloride intraperitoneally to the mouse to help the mouse recovered from deep anesthesia quickly. Return the mouse to a mouse cage with pre-heated pads.\n\tNOTE: Do not let the mouse left unattended until the mouse regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nInject 0.4 mg/kg of butorphanol tartrate to the mouse for the management of pain when the mouse wakes up.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. As a first hint for successful tBCCAO, eyelid drooping of the mouse can be observed (Figure 2).\nFor euthanasia, inject 3x of MMB mixture to the mice and sacrifice them for experiments.\n3. General observations (survival rates and eyelid drooping)\nAfter the surgery, check survival rates for all causes of death at day 0 (after the surgery), 1, 3 and 7.",
    "Assess eyelid drooping by a 4-point rating scale: 1 = no drooping, 2 = mild drooping (~50%), 3 = severe drooping (over 50%), and 4 = severe drooping with eye discharge.\n4. Retinal blood perfusion\nInject 200 μL of FITC-dextran (25 mg/mL) into the left ventricle of the mouse, which is commonly used for the observation of blood perfusion in mouse retinal vessels13,14.\n2 minutes after circulation, enucleate the eyes and fix in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour. The retinas were carefully obtained and flat-mounted, as previously described15, and examined via a fluorescence microscope.\nTake photographs of the retinal whole mounts at 4x magnification and merge into a single using a merge analyzer, previously described16.\nMeasure the perfused areas via a vessel analysis tool in NIH Fiji/ImageJ software.\n5. Western blot\n3 and 6 hours after tBCCAO, obtain the eyes of mice and immediately transfer to a Petri dish containing cold PBS to isolate the retinas.\nAfter isolation of the retinas, perform western blotting, as previously described9.\nIncubate with antibodies for hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α; a general hypoxia marker) and for β-Actin (an internal loading control) overnight followed by incubation of HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Visualize the signals via chemiluminescence.\n6. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)\n6, 12 and 24 hours after tBCCAO, process the obtained retinas for qPCR, as previously described17.\nPerform qPCR via real-time PCR system. Primers used are listed in Table 1. Calculate fold changes between levels of different transcripts by the ΔΔCT method.\n7. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n3 days after tBCCAO, obtain the eyes of mice and embed in paraffin.\nCut the paraffin-embedded eyes by a microtome to obtain the eye sections.\nDe-paraffinize and stain the eye sections of 5 μm thickness as previously described13.",
    "Incubate with an antibody for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; a reliable marker for astrocytes and Müller cells in the retina) overnight followed by incubation of Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibody.\nUse DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for staining the nucleus in the retina. Visualize signals via a fluorescence microscope.\nAssess morphology scoring by a 4-point rating scale, as previously described13,18: 0 = no signal, 1 = few positive glial end-feet in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), 2 = few labelled processes reaching from GCL to the outer nuclear layer (ONL), and 3 = most labelled processes reaching from GCL to ONL.\n8. Electroretinography (ERG)\n3 and 7 days after tBCCAO, perform ERG using a Ganzfeld dome, acquisition system and LED stimulators, as previously described9.\nFollowing dark adaptation overnight, anesthetize mice with a combination of MMB under dim red light.\nUse a mixed solution of 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine to dilate the pupils.\nPlace the active electrodes on contact lens and place the reference electrode in the mouth.\nObtain ERG responses from both eyes of each animal.\nRecord scotopic responses under dark adaptation with various stimuli.\nMeasure the amplitudes of a-wave from the baseline to the lowest point of a-wave.\nMeasure the amplitudes of b-wave from the lowest point of a-wave to the peak of b-wave.\nKeep all mice warm during the procedure using heat pads.\n9. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)\n2 weeks after tBCCAO, perform OCT using SD-OCT system, as previously reported8,9.\nFor the measurement, subject mice to mydriasis by a mixed solution of 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine, and to general anesthesia by a mixture of MMB.\nObtain B scan images from equatorial slices of en-face scans.\nExamine the retinas at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mm from the optic nerve head.",
    "Measure retinal thickness from the retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL) to the external limiting membrane (ELM), and consider the average of measured values as retinal thickness of an individual mouse.\nPlot the results as spider diagrams.\nSubscription Required.
