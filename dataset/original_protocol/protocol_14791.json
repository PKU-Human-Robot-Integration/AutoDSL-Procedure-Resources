    "In vivo imaging is performed in pathogen-free facilities using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Utah.\nNOTE: This imaging protocol is used for reporter mice in which retinal microglia and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages express green-fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the fractalkine receptor locus (CX3CR1).\n1. In Vivo Imaging of Retinal GFP+ Microglia by Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (cSLO)\nTurn on the water-controlled heating system, set to stabilize mouse temperature between 35-37 ºC during procedure, and connect two heating pads.\n\t\nStart the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO) system (Figure 2A). Open the cSLO program, enter the information that will identify the individual mouse and set a corneal curvature of 2 mm (Patient Data menu).\nPrepare for imaging. Securely fit a clean 55º wide-field objective lens on its socket. Prepare the ophthalmoscope imaging platform by securing a heating pad covered with clean paper. Use clips to flatten the pad and paper and keep them from blocking the movement of the objective lens.\nAnesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 1.3% 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and 0.8% tert-amyl alcohol (250 mg/kg body weight; 0.5 ml/25 g body weight) using a 30½ G needle fitted to a 1 ml disposable syringe. Return mouse to its cage, kept over a heating pad.\n\tNOTE: The delivery of the anesthetic by injection versus inhalation allows easier positioning of the mouse for imaging and unobstructed access to the eyes, free of nose cones and tubing.\nOnce the animal stops moving and is unresponsive to tail pinch, induce pupil dilation with Tropicamide and phenylephrine (0.5% each), by positioning the animal prone and covering both eyes with the drops for 7 min.",
    "After 5 min, place the mouse prone on the center of the ophthalmoscope platform, and fit contact lenses over both eyes, applying minimal pressure.\n\tNOTE: Contact lenses are small and fragile but can be carefully handled with fingers, although forceps can be used instead40. The use of contact lenses is optional, but recommended as it minimizes eye dryness and preserves corneal transparency during imaging.\nAfter 7 min, orient the mouse with the right eye facing the objective lens and the orbit parallel to the objective lens, keeping the animal unrestrained near the edge of the platform (Figure 2B). To collect images of comparable saturation and orientation, constantly maintain the distance from eye to objective lens, as well as the alignment of the eye to the light path throughout imaging sessions. Clip long whiskers interfering with observation of the eye.\n\tNOTE: For the next 8-10 min, the mouse will not move or blink, and will breath with gentle movements, which are tracked by the cSLO Eye Tracking ART (automatic real time) mode, which adjusts the scan head position based on fundus landmarks with high contrast. Past that time, mice begin panting and blinking, making imaging impractical.\nIf imaging is performed without using contact lenses, apply PBS drops to both eyes every 2-3 min to prevent them from drying.\nCollect a fundus image of the retinal vasculature and optic disc, focused on the inner retina.\n\t\nSelect the infrared mode (IR) and adjust settings to 820 nm excitation, 100% laser power, 40-60% sensitivity (Figure 2C).\nWorking in high-speed mode (12.6 frame/sec), locate the eye using the joystick to drive the ophthalmoscope. At low magnification, inspect the cornea and lens for injury or opacity, and exclude from the study eyes with defects or injury that will affect imaging the retina (Figure 3A).",
    "Locate the optic disc area (the surface of the optic nerve head, ONH) by bringing the objective closer to the eye, then center the image on it and lock this position by screwing the joystick. This alignment of the eye to the ophthalmoscope is key to obtain even focus and emission across the image.\nVisualize the inner planes of the retina, as well as the ONH, using the major blood vessels located on the vitreal surface of the retina as a reference focal plane (59 and 60 D), or deeper (55 D) in eyes showing excavated optic discs. The optimal focus should resolve circulating blood cells within major blood vessels, with their lumen and walls clearly distinct.\nOptimize image saturation by adjusting the dial on the touch screen control panel, until a white halo of uniform illumination spans in most of the 55º fundus field around the optic disc (using slight overexposure). Next, lower the saturation to optimize contrast until blood cells moving along the major vessels can be clearly resolved. If focal dark areas persist, not due to retinal damage, realign the eye to the camera until a uniformly bright image is obtained. This adjustment is fundamental to capture reproducible sets of images in position and quality.\nCollect a high-resolution IR image of the central retina (1.4-1.7 mm in diameter, depending on age), averaging 30 frames in real time (4.7 frames/sec; normalized), to improve signal-to-noise ratio (Figure 2D).\nImmediately, acquire a fluorescence image of GFP+ microglia and/or infiltrating monocytes localized to the inner planes of the retina and the ONH.",
    "NOTE: Optimization of the IR fundus image of the retina determines the resolution of the fluorescence image of GFP+ cells, as well as the extent of inner retina spanned. Failure to focus the inner planes of the retina, which can be detected by poor resolution of the vasculature, will result in dimmed GFP+ cell views (Figure 3B). Failure to adjust IR saturation correctly and uniformly affects the fluorescence image (FA), introducing artifactual variations in GFP+ cell intensity and size (Figure 3C).\n\t\nSwich to fluorescence imaging mode (FA) in the touch screen panel, using blue, 488 nm laser excitation (460-490 nm barrier filter set), and acquisition settings (100% laser power and 100-125% sensitivity), which are maintained constant for all mice (Figure 2E).\nCollect a single xy-point, bidimensional fluorescence image of the retina, and immediately capture a fundus image at identical position (100x scan average; 55º scan angle for both images; Figure 2F).\nCapture a multipoint image by selecting “composite” in the control panel (Figure 2G) and moving the ophthalmoscope right and left, panning the retina across the nasal-temporal axis (Figure 2H).\n\t\tNOTE: After scanning a single xy-point image (100x scan average), the software automatically averages new scans of the same and new areas (circumscribed with a green circle during optimal scan, or red when the scan is unfeasible), and stitches all xy-positions in real time. The resulting composite image spans 1.5-1.7 mm on the horizontal axis x 3-4 mm in the vertical axis (55º x 120-124º scan angle).\nComplete imaging of each mouse within 15 min after inducing anesthesia, before blinking and motion restarts.\nRemove contact lenses, hydrate eyes with PBS and return the animal to its warmed cage, checking behavior until full recovery of motility.",
    "For longitudinal studies using intermittent cSLO-imaging sessions in the same individual mouse, repeat imaging no less than 3 days apart to avoid the cumulative toxicity of anesthesia, as well as corneal irritation.\n2. Live Image Processing and Analysis\nSequential image alignment:\n\t\nAlign the fundus images for a time series of the same eye using the vasculature and optic disc as landmarks. Open all images in a commercial slide-show presentation program, by dragging each image over the preceding one until their optic discs align on the xy-plane (the top image appears semi-transparent while being dragged), then rotate the top image until its major blood vessels overlap with the vasculature on the image below (focus on vessels farthest from the optic disc). Record the rotation angle for each image and save this time series for future reference, keeping track of mouse and eye identity.\nAlign the corresponding series of single xy-point fluorescence images by applying the recorded angle to correct the x-y rotation at each time point, using a raster graphic editor program. Additionally, adjust resolution to 300 dpi (without rescaling) and background (in the RGB mode, select Levels and sample the lumen of a blood vessel as black). Save these images as TIF files, adding “aligned” to their names.\nMicroglial cell segmentation:\n\t\nTo identify GFP+ cells in the central retina, open in FluoRender the “aligned” TIF file corresponding to the earliest time point/age. Zoom the image to fit the screen, then define the Render view (composite, orthogonal, interpolated) and its properties (0.58 gamma, 255 saturation point, 255 luminance, 195 alpha and 1.00 shading), selecting both the RG channels as visible (hide B channel by double-clicking it in the Workspace frame; Figure 4A).",
    "To select individual cells, threshold the red channel (must be highlighted on the Workspace frame), by increasing the low threshold until the majority of cells are masked (white) with minimum overlap and cell processes (cyan), while keeping the high threshold constant (255). The low threshold value varies between 100 and 170, depending on the fluorescence intensity (Figure 4B).\nSave this view with the red channel visible only (Capture command) as a new TIF file, adding “cellsegm” to its original name (Figure 4C). Using a generic raster graphic editor software, invert its greyscale and adjust resolution to 300 dpi as above, and save again as RGB (Figure 4D).\n\t\tNOTE: Delete the folders (projects) automatically created by FluoRender, and save the applied threshold for future reference.\nMicroglial soma segmentation and morphometry:\n\t\nTo identify GFP+ cell somata for area quantification, use image analysis software with automated intensity measurements and threshold capabilities, as well as threshold-based object counting and measurement. Open the “cellsegm” TIF file, and select the rescaling method (spline) and the red channel (click red tab in RGB). Improve visualization by deselecting “view channel in color” (right-click the red RGB tab), and selecting “complement colors” (Image/Adjust Image) to invert the greyscale and see the cells in grey/black over white background (Figure 4E).\nCalibrate the image to 1.4-1.7 mm depending on age, by drawing a horizontal line across the entire image (Calibration, Quick Calibration).\nSegment individual cell somata by applying intensity thresholding (Figure 4B). For this, work on the red RGB channel and open the Threshold Intensity function (Object Count; selecting “count update” command) in order to track bidimensional parameters for each thresholded region of interest (ROI) representing individual somata.",
    "Define the intensity threshold in the intensity histogram, by selecting the lowest 50-60% of the 255 levels, and refining the final threshold value by visually assessing the overlap between the threshold color mask (blue) and the cell soma perimeter (grey) in individual cells (Figure 4E).\nEstimate the accuracy of the cell soma masks to represent the somal dimensions by measuring the area before and after segmentation in 10 cells and accept the selected threshold range if the measurements differ less than 10% (use the Binary Toolbar and Annotated Measurements).\nManually identify somal ROIs that include multiple cells and separate these elements (eliminate or separate ROIs using the Binary Toolbar controls, or the Object Catalog) while toggling on/off the binary to directly visualize the cells (Figure 4F).\nClassify microglial cells as ROIs with somal areas larger and smaller than 50-60 µm2 to discriminate cell somata corresponding to activated microglia and deactivated microglia respectively, by using Area Restriction.\n\t\tNOTE: Each cell somal subset is identified with a different pseudocolored binary layer, and can be further characterized for other morphological parameters (perimeter, circularity, etc.), as well as quantified within discrete retinal sectors (Figure 4G). Save the analyzed image as an ND2 file.\nVerify the process and branching complexity in individual activated microglial cells, by overlaying the somal mask and the single xy-point image (contrast increased 50%; Figure 4H). Manually count the processes directly extending from the cell soma or measure the diameter of the polygon encompassing the arbor (use the Binary Toolbar and Annotated Measurements).\n\t\tNOTE: Activated cells lack processes or bear few (<4) and short (<2x somal diameter) ones, in contrast to non-activated cell processes, which comprise a ramified and extensive arbor (> 3-10x somal diameter) surrounding their relatively small soma.",
    "Manually identify cells with somata smaller than <20 µm2 and/or GFP expression below the detection limit, which are therefore undetected by intensity thresholding. Use the Taxonomy command in Annotations to count manually identified elements.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
