    "Note: This protocol is modified from the original method described in Samuel et al. (2001). Microinjection of chemical calcium indicator dyeInject 100 µM Calcium Green-1 dextran solution into the distal arm of the anterior gonad of a gravid adult hermaphrodite by using a standard method for C. elegans DNA microinjection (see Evans, 2006). We use a GDC-1 glass capillary with filament pulled by the PC-10 puller in the double-pulling mode. In addition, we use a 2% or 3.5% agarose gel pad on a 24 x 55 mm cover glass for worm immobilization and liquid paraffin to protect the specimen from drying. Notes: Fill about half the gonad as described in Samuel et al. (2001). Injecting too much dye often results in an abnormal gonad shape after recovery.We always place only one worm per agarose pad for injection to minimize the time that the worm is immobilized and hence minimize the damage.We typically inject four to six worms in a single set of experiments (e.g., one genotype) and perform two sets of experiments in a day with a 2-h interval. Approximately half of the injected worms can be imaged for each set of experiments.To recover the injected worm, apply approximately 1 µl of injection recovery solution onto the worm by using a P20 micropipette.By using a P20 micropipette, suck up the injected worm in the drop of injection recovery solution and transfer it from the agarose pad to a 3.5-cm OP50/NGM plate.Note: A single injection procedure from picking to transfer (steps A1-A3) should be completed within approximately 5 min.Allow the injected worm to recover on the plate in a dark chamber for 4-6 h at room temperature.Check whether the injected dye is incorporated into the oocytes of the worm by using a stereo fluorescence microscope.",
    "Note: Sloppy injection can result in leakage and incorporation of the dye into the coelomocytes (Samuel et al., 2001).Worm preparation and imagingNote: The worm-immobilization method is modified from the original method described in Kim et al. (2013).Melt VALAP at 130 °C on a hot plate.Prepare a 10% agarose gel pad.Prepare two double-taped glass slides (Figure 1A). The thickness of the tape stack in this image was 0.36 mm.Melt the 10% NuSieve GTG agarose/M9 buffer in a microwave oven.Apply a drop of the melted 10% NuSieve GTG agarose/M9 buffer to a glass slide between the two taped glass slides by using a micro spatula (Figure 1A; Video 1).Cover the melted agarose drop with another glass slide (Figure 1B; Video 1).Incubate for at least 30 min at room temperature to solidify the agarose pad. Keep the agarose pad covered by the glass slide until use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170326/20170326235818_3813.jpgFigure 1. Sample preparation. A. A drop of 10% agarose is applied to a glass slide between the two double-taped spacers by using a micro spatula. B. A slide glass is placed on the 10% agarose drop. C. A drop of microsphere suspension and a drop of serotonin/M9 solution are applied to the agarose pad on the stage of a stereo microscope. D. A sample ready for imaging, in which the cover glass is stabilized by VALAP on the agarose pad (a non-injected worm is immobilized in this image).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Preparation of a 10% agarose gel pad Allow the polystyrene microsphere suspension and the serotonin hydrochloride/M9 buffer to warm at room temperature for at least 30 min before use.Check the shape of the leading oocyte of the injected worm to determine the timing of ovulation by using the stereo fluorescence microscope.",
    "The shape of the leading oocyte should appear rectangular, and its nucleus should be in the cortical region distal to the spermatheca (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170327/20170327000033_2481.jpgFigure 2. Inference of the timing of ovulation on the basis of the oocyte shape. A. An oocyte that appears ready to be ovulated within a few minutes. The oocyte shape is rectangular, the boundary facing the next oocyte looks like a straight line (indicated by the black line), and the nucleus is close to the cortical region distal to the spermatheca. B. An oocyte not ready for imaging. The boundary has an arc-like appearance (indicated by the black line), and the nucleus is not close to the distal cortex. Differential interference contrast images of non-injected wild-type worms are shown. Images are flipped to be in the same direction as the confocal microscopy images in Figure 3. Arrowheads indicate the nucleus. The black lines were drawn to emphasize the boundaries. Scale bar = 20 µm.Remove the glass slide covering the agarose pad and apply 0.5 µl of the 0.10-µm polystyrene microsphere suspension to the center of the agarose pad (Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Worm-immobilization Apply 0.5 µl of 20 mg/ml serotonin hydrochloride/M9 buffer to the polystyrene microsphere suspension on the agarose pad (Figure 1C; Video 2). Serotonin is believed to promote fertilization (Samuel et al., 2001).Notes: Do not mix the polystyrene microspheres and the serotonin in advance because mixing causes the microspheres to aggregate.Although we usually use serotonin, it is not necessary, and we have observed normal ovulation and fertilization in worms immobilized without serotonin (Takayama and Onami, 2016). Transfer the worm that is due to ovulate within a few minutes from the 3.5-cm OP50/NGM plate to the drop on the agarose pad by using a worm pick (Video 2).",
    "Arrange the orientation of the worm by using a worm pick such that the oocytes with the injected dye will be situated just beneath the cover glass. Because of the asymmetrical configuration of the anterior and posterior gonads, only one proximal gonad can usually be situated just beneath the cover glass.Gently place an 18 x 18 mm cover glass on the agarose pad (Video 2).Stabilize the cover glass by applying four drops of melted VALAP on the four corners of the cover glass by using a P20 micropipette (Figure 1D; Video 2).Position the sample slide glass on the spinning disk confocal microscope.Find the worm by using low-magnification objective lenses (e.g., 10x or 20x).Use a high-magnification water-immersion objective lens to set the field-of-view and the focal plane that best capture the leading sperm in the spermatheca that is expected to fertilize the oocyte.Start the time-lapse recording when the worm starts ovulating. Typical time-lapse settings for 2D time-lapse imaging are as follows: exposure, 178.6 msec; camera binning, 2; time interval, 0.2 sec (fastest); and duration, 6 min. For 3D time-lapse imaging, the typical settings are as follows: exposure, 50 msec; camera binning, 2; time interval, 1.0 sec; duration, 6 min; z-plane interval, 1 µm; and number of z-planes, 12. The EM-gain is set so that the intensities of the image will be in the predefined range (e.g., 0-4,095 for 12 bit).Save images as a 16-bit multi-tiff image file.Capture fluorescence reference images for uneven illumination correction by using a fluorescence reference slide. We typically capture at least 40 different images in the protein film region for the foreground and 5 different images for the background in the 14-bit range (0-16,383)."
