    "Human tissues used in this protocol have been handled according to the guidelines of the Institution's human research ethics committee (NO.2015120401, date: May 12, 2015).\n1. Preparations\nCollect fresh adult abdominal skin tissues discarded from plastic surgery at the hospital in a 50-mL tube with 10 mL of ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM). The specimen can be kept at 4 °C for up to 72 h without significantly affecting the cell viability.\nPrepare the reagents and culture medium as described below.\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/L) to 50 mL of phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) to prepare the washing solution.\nPrepare two sets of enzyme digestion solutions: (1) prepare 50 mL of dispase (2.5 mg/mL in DMEM) and 50 mL of type I collagenase (2.5 mg/mL in DMEM) separately for the conventional method; and (2) prepare 50 mL of a mixture of dispase and type I collagenase (dissolve 125 mg of dispase powder and 125 mg of type I collagenase powder in 50 mL of DMEM) for the new method.\n\t\tNOTE: All enzyme solutions should be filtered with a 0.22-µm strainer and kept at4 °C.\nPrepare digestion solutions for both methods: 0.05% trypsin and 0.25% trypsin were commercially purchased. Prepare a 10 mg/mL DNase I solution by dissolving 50 mg of DNase I powder in 5 mL of PBS, filter it with a 0.22-µm strainer, and store it at -20 °C.\nPrepare 500 mL of medium to neutralize the enzymatic digestion: DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nPrepare 500 mL of inoculation medium (growth-factor-containing medium, called G-medium): DMEM/F12 (3:1) medium containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 40 µg/mL fungizone, 40 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 2% B27 supplement.",
    "Pretreat 100-mm cell culture dishes with 2 mL of coating matrix containing type I collagen for 30 min at room temperature.\n2. Conventional Method\nSkin tissue pretreatment\nTake 1.5 cm2 of skin tissue and wash it 1x with 10 mL of PBS; then, rinse it with 10 mL of 70% ethanol for 30 s and incubate it 2x with 10 mL of washing solution (PBS containing 2% penicillin and streptomycin), 5 min each.\n\t\tNOTE: All washes are performed in 100-mm cell culture dishes inside a laminar flow hood.\nTrim the tissue with sterile scissors to remove the subcutaneous fat layer in a 100-mm cell culture dish and, then, weigh the skin tissue (the weight is 1 g in this protocol).\n\t\tNOTE: Sufficient trimming is very crucial for the efficient separation of the epidermis from the dermis. The yellowish fat layer can be easily distinguished visually.\nTransfer the tissue to another 100-mm sterile dish with the dermis side down and, then, cut the skin tissue into 3- to 4-mm-wide strips using a scalpel blade.\n\t\tNOTE: The dermis side with the fat layer is easily recognized visually.\nAdd 10 mL of 2.5 mg/mL dispase solution to the skin tissues in a 100-mm culture dish and, then, incubate the dish overnight at 4 °C (no more than 20 h).\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of dispase solution can be calculated by using 10 mL of dispase solution for the digestion of each gram of tissue.\nSeparation of the epidermis from the skin tissue\nOn the second day, peel off the epidermis from the dermis using fine tweezers.\n\t\tNOTE: If it is difficult to peel off the epidermis, the dispase digestion was not sufficient, which is usually due to insufficient trimming of the tissue. In this case, the tissue needs a longer incubation time.",
    "Mince the peeled epidermis with 500 µL of cell culture medium into a tissue slurry using scalpel blades; then, resuspend it with 10 mL of 0.25% trypsin in a 50-mL tube and incubate it 20 min in a water bath at 37 °C, with shaking.\nCollection and culturing of primary cells\nNeutralize the trypsin activity by adding an equal volume of neutralization solution (10 mL in this protocol).\nDissociate the epidermal cells by pipetting the solution up and down 20x with a 10-mL serological pipette and pass the cell solution through a 100-µm cell strainer to remove any residual tissue debris.\nCentrifuge the cell solution at 200 x g for 5 min after filtration; resuspend the cell pellet in neutralization medium for washing and, then, centrifuge it again at 200 x g to obtain the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of low-calcium, serum-free keratinocyte medium (SFM). Take 10 µL of this solution to count the total cell number and, then, plate about 2 x 106 cells with 10 mL of SFM into 100-mm cell culture dishes pretreated with coating matrix (containing type I collagen).\n\t\tNOTE: Coating is a necessary step for the conventional method.\nChange the culture medium every 2 d.\n\t\tNOTE: Check the cell adhesion under a microscope before and after changing the culture medium.\nPassage the cells when they reach about 80% confluence.\n\t\tNOTE: All culture dishes are pretreated with the coating matrix.\n3. The New Method\nSkin tissue pretreatment\nCollect the tissue as described above (step 2.1) for the conventional method.\nWash the skin tissue 1x with 10 mL of PBS and, then, weigh it in a sterile plastic container by an electronic scale (the weight is around 1 g in this protocol).",
    "NOTE: The minimum weight of tissue needed for this protocol is 0.1 g, since it is difficult to obtain a sufficient number of cells if the tissue specimen used is too small. There is no maximum weight of tissue for this protocol, which ultimately depends on the handling capacity of the operator.\nUse forceps to rinse the skin tissue with 10 mL of 70% ethanol for 30 s.\nIncubate the tissue 2x with 10 mL of washing solution (prepared in step 2.1.1), for 5 min each time.\n\t\tNOTE: All the washing steps noted above are performed in 100-mm cell culture dishes inside a laminar flow hood (a tissue culture hood).\nTransfer the tissue to another 100-mm cell culture sterile dish.\nUsing scalpel blades, mince the tissue thoroughly into a tissue slurry.\nAdd 200 µL of PBS every 5 min to keep the tissues wet.\n\t\tNOTE: Take around 15 min for steps 3.1.5 - 3.1.7. All the above steps are performed at room temperature.\nDigestion of skin tissue\nTransfer the homogenized tissue solution into a 50-mL tube. Add 10 mL of enzyme mixture for every 1 g of skin tissue. Mix the enzymes thoroughly with the homogenized tissues.\nIncubate the mixture with shaking in a water bath at 37 °C for 1 h.\nAdd a 1/5 volume of 0.25% trypsin (2.5 mL in this protocol) to the digestion mixture for another 30 min in a water bath at 37 °C.\nAdd DNase I solution to the enzyme mixture at a 1:100 (v/v) ratio (250 µL in this protocol) and incubate it for 5 min at room temperature.\nCollection and culturing of primary cells",
    "Stop the digestion process by adding 12.5 mL of neutralization medium in a 1:1 ratio. Pipette the solution up and down for about 20x, using a 10-mL serological pipette to dissociate the cells.\nFilter the dissociated cells through a 100-µm cell strainer to remove the tissue debris. Centrifuge the supernatant at 200 x g for 5 min. Observe the pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the cell pellet with 10 mL of neutralization medium, and centrifuge again at 200 x g for 5 min to collect the cells.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of inoculation medium (G-medium from step 1.2.5) with 10 µM of Y-27632.\nTake 10 µL of the solution to count the total cell number and, then, plate about 2 x 106 cells with 10 mL of G-medium into a 100-mm cell culture dish.\n\t\tNOTE: The precoating step is not necessary for the new method, and no removal of the dermal layer is required either.\nAfter 3 d, replace the inoculation medium with low-calcium SFM medium. Change the culture medium every 2 d.\n\t\tNOTE: Check the cell adhesion before and after changing the medium.\nPassage the cells when they reach about 80% confluence.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, pretreat the cells with 0.05% trypsin for 2 min and wash the cells with PBS to remove contaminating dermal cells before trypsinizing the epidermal cells.\n4. Cell Passaging\nRemove the medium, wash the cells with PBS, and, then, add 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin (per each 100-mm dish).\nIncubate the cells in an incubator (37 °C with 5% CO2) for 5 min.\nCheck the cells using a microscope to make sure that all cells have detached from the culture dish.",
    "Add 8 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS to neutralize the enzymatic reaction and, then, collect the cells in a 15-mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min to obtain the cell pellet.\nRemove the supernatant slowly and, then, resuspend the cell pellet with 10 mL of SFM medium and count the number of cells.\nPlate 1 x 106 cells with 10 mL of SFM into each 100-mm cell dish.\nChange the medium every 2 d.\nSubscription Required.
