    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart I. Cell surface lectin staining\nTiming: 2 days (for steps 1 to 3)\nLectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that can specifically interact with certain glycan branches of glycoproteins. Therefore, lectins are frequently used to identify specific post-translational modifications on glycoproteins,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] which could thus be considered as glycosylation enzyme activity indicators.\nHere, we introduce the lectin staining protocol using rhodamine-labeled PHA-L (rhodamine-PHA-L), which recognizes the tri- and tetra-antennary complex-type N-glycan. Researchers should choose the lectin(s) with desired binding affinity depending on their research purposes.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]\n(Day 0) Seed WT and MAN1 QKO CHO cells on coverslips in 6-well plates as described in “Before you begin - splitting and seeding cells”. Incubate cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 overnight (16–20 h).\n(Day 1) Transfect CHO cells as described in “before you begin – Transfection of cells”.\n(Day 2) Fixation and cell surface lectin staining.\nAspirate the medium.\nAdd 1.5 mL PBS per well to rinse the cells. Aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 1.5 mL of 1% (w/v) PFA fixation buffer per well at room temperature and incubate for 15 min.\nCritical: Handle the PFA buffer in a ventilation hood.\nCollect the PFA buffer with a pipette and dispose it in the aldehyde waste disposal.\nAdd 1.5 mL of PBS per well and wash thoroughly. Aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 1.5 mL of 50 mM NH4Cl quenching buffer per well at room temperature and incubate for 10 min. Aspirate the quenching buffer.\nAdd 1.5 mL of PBS per well and wash thoroughly. Aspirate the PBS. Repeat this step for a total of three times.\nAdd 1.5 mL of PBSB blocking buffer per well at room temperature and incubate with gentle rocking for 30 min. Aspirate the blocking buffer.",
    "Transfer coverslips with a fine-tip tweezer to a 24-well plate. Add 500 μL 2 μg/mL PHA-L in PBSB per well and incubate for 30 min with gentle rocking in a 4°C cold room.\nNote: Wrap the plate with aluminum foil to avoid light exposure during incubation.\nAspirate the PHA-L solution and transfer coverslips to a 6-well plate.\nAdd 1.5 mL of PBS per well and wash with gentle rocking for 5 min.\nRepeat step 3k 3 times.\nNote: Extend or repeat washing if non-specific signal is detected.\nRinse the coverslips with Milli-Q H2O.\nMount the coverslips on slides with Moviol.\nKeep the slides in dark and allow the Moviol to dry completely. This normally takes overnight at 4°C.\nImage with NIS-Elements C confocal microscope with a 60× oil lens and Z-stacks at 0.3 μm intervals.\nPause point: Ideally, the staining and imaging process should be completed as soon as possible. Alternatively, mounted slides can be stored in dark at 4°C for 4 weeks or at −20°C for up to 3 months.\nPart II. Live cell imaging of cell surface lectin stain at the onset of mitotic exit\nTiming: 2 days (for steps 4 to 6)\nIn our study investigating mitotic regulation of N-glycosylation, we discovered that the enzymatic activity MAN1A1 undergoes cell cycle-dependent regulation.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] However, because mitotic trafficking block prevents MAN1A1 substrates from being delivered to the cell surface, it is impossible to analyze the activity of MAN1A1 (and its phospho-deficient mutant) in mitosis by cell surface lectin staining of mitotic cells, as we did above in interphase cells.\nHere, we introduce a live cell imaging protocol used to capture glycosylation changes at the cell surface upon the arrival of cargo proteins at the onset of mitotic exit when membrane trafficking resumes.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]",
    "(Day 0) Seed MAN1 QKO CHO cells on glass-bottom dishes as described in “Before you begin - splitting and seeding cells”. Incubate cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 overnight (16–20 h).\n(Day 1) Transfection and nocodazole treatment to synchronize cells.\nTransfect CHO cells as described in “before you begin – Transfection of cells”.\n6 h after transfection, change medium to complete growth medium containing 150 ng/mL nocodazole.\nIncubate cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 18 h.\nNote: Nocodazole treatment blocks cells to prometaphase. The concentration and time used for nocodazole blockage may vary depending on the cell line used. To determine the synchronization rate, a pilot experiment of Hoechst staining can be conducted to titrate the nocodazole treatment with the chosen cell line. The synchronized cells should be arrested at prometaphase. >90% of arrested cells should be observed in a successful nocodazole blockage.\n(Day 2) Live cell imaging.\nChange medium to imaging medium (DMEM, no phenol red, no fetal bovine serum added for short term imaging) containing 150 ng/mL nocodazole.\nPlace the glass-bottom dish in a live-cell imaging chamber at 37°C with 5% CO2 coupled to a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2 Confocal microscope.\nObserve under a 60× oil objective to identify mitotic cells.\nSave the locations of the mitotic cells.\nWash the cells extensively. In brief, cells are washed by adding excess (1 mL) imaging medium containing 100 μg/mL CHX to the empty space in the dish to avoid detaching cells and the medium is removed by a vacuum system. Repeat this step for three times, and incubate cells with imaging medium containing 100 μg/mL CHX and 2 μg/mL rhodamine-PHA-L.",
    "Note: Removing nocodazole thoroughly is critical for releasing cells from prometaphase. This step should be completed as fast as possible and try not to move the stage, and the live cell imaging program should be run immediately after double checking the saved positions and optimal z stack.\nCritical: Be aware that mitotic cells can detach from the dish easily. Removal of medium should be practiced fast but cautiously.\nTake images every 2 min with 5 stacks (0.8 μm/stack).\nProcess the generated videos with maximum intensity projection.\nNote: Time 0 is 5 min after nocodazole washout due to the time needed for the procedure and equipment setting.\nPart III. PNGase F and Endo H cleavage of a secreted reporter glycoprotein\nTiming: 4–5 days (for steps 7 to 10)\nPNGase F is an amidase which cleaves the innermost GlcNAc on asparagine residues with high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides. Endo H is a glycosidase that cleaves N-linked mannose-rich oligosaccharides, but not complex oligosaccharides. Both enzymes are frequently used in protein glycosylation studies to deglycosylate glycoproteins.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22],23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23] Endo H is also commonly used to monitor intracellular protein trafficking through the secretory pathway.24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24],25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]\nHere, we introduce a protocol using the two enzymes to detect the glycosylation of a secreted reporter protein sHF-LIPA,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] which indicates the enzymatic activity of the exogenously expressed MAN1A1 in a MAN1 QKO CHO cell line.\n(Day 0) Seed WT and MAN1 QKO CHO cells as described in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] - splitting and seeding cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5]”. Incubate cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 overnight (16–20 h). In the following steps WT and MAN1 QKO CHO cells are analyzed in parallel.\n(Day 1) Transfect CHO cells as described in “before you begin – Transfection of cells”.\n(Day 2-4) Maintain the transfected cells.",
    "Note: Check growing status and viability of the cells. Split on Day 2 if necessary. Depending on the proliferation rate of the cell line used, try to avoid medium change before collection day.\n(Days 4–5) Collect conditioned media and perform PNGase F and Endo H cleavage assay.\nCollect 10 mL conditioned medium to a 15 mL falcon centrifuge tube. Spin the medium at 1,000 g at 4°C for 3 min to remove dead cells.\nWash 200 μL of HisPurTM Ni-NTA resin with 1 mL His-binding buffer.\nCritical: The Ni-NTA resin is supplied as 50% slurry in 20% ethanol. This washing step is required to remove ethanol extensively.\nCollect the supernatant from 10a, mix with prewashed Ni-NTA resin and transfer to a new 15 mL tube. Incubate with gentle rotation at 4°C for 2 h.\nSpin at 1000 g at 4°C for 3 min to collect the Ni-NTA resin.\nResuspend the resin with 1 mL His-binding buffer and transfer to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nWash the Ni-NTA resin with 1 mL His-binding buffer by gently inverting the tube 3–5 times. Spin at 1,000 g at 4°C for 3 min. Discard the supernatant carefully without disturbing the Ni-NTA resin pellet.\nNote: Use a swing-out rotor to pellet the resin at the bottom of the tube.\nRepeat steps 10f 3 times.\nAdd 150 μL His-elution buffer and mix well with Ni-NTA resin. Spin at 1,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nCollect 135 μL supernatant carefully without disturbing the resin. Add 15 μL of 10× glycoprotein denaturing buffer (New England Biolabs) and heat at 95°C for 5 min.\nPrepare reaction solutions as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2670_9.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2670_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2670_11.csv\nIncubate at 37°C on a shaker for 1 h.\nTerminate reactions by adding 12 μL 6× SDS loading buffer and heating at 95°C for 3 min.",
