    "Note: All steps should be performed in a DNase and RNase free environment unless otherwise described. Collection of Sample/EmbryoCarefully collect tissue samples/mouse embryos (Figure 1) in a 35 mm dish or 24-well plate with DPBS (Downs and Davies, 1993;          Piliszek et al., 2011;          Pereira et al., 2011).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4229/bioprotoc-11-22-4229-g001.jpgFigure 1. Representative images of the unstained collected mouse gastrula at E6.5, E7.0, and E7.5 stages. Images were acquired with a Olympus SZX10/16 microscope. Scale bars: 100 μm.Fix embryos in 4% PFA (see Recipes) at 4°C overnight.Transfer the embryos into a graded series of methanol (25% Methanol/DPBS; 50% Methanol/DPBS; 75% Methanol/DPBS; 100% methanol) at room temperature (RT). Embryos are dehydrated for 5 min in each condition. Sufficient volume should be applied to completely submerge the embryo samples.Note: Prepare graded series of methanol buffer right before use. Pause point: The dehydrated embryos could be stored in 100% methanol at -20°C for up to 1 week. Preparation of digoxigenin labeled RNA ProbesPrimer design for target cDNA sequence cloning:For direct transcription of the PCR product in vitro, a minimal T7 promoter sequence (5-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA-3) should be added to the 5’ terminal of the primer. The length of probe sequence should be 250-1,500 bases; probes with 600-900 bases exhibit the highest sensitivity and specificity.PCR amplification and purification of probe DNA:A cDNA pool with high enrichment of target transcripts was used as PCR template for amplification of probe DNA. DNA polymerases such as KOD FX Neo with high fidelity characteristics are recommended. The exact PCR conditions should be adjusted according to the selected probe. After agarose gel separation, excise target DNA fragments precisely and perform gel extraction following the manufacturer’s instructions (Figure 2). Determine the concentration of acquired DNA using NanoDrop 2000.",
    "Note: For in vitro transcription from plasmid, the plasmid should be linearized with appropriate restriction enzyme digestion and purified with a commercial kit. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4229/bioprotoc-11-22-4229-g002.jpgFigure 2. Specific probe DNA (here for Tal1 gene) amplified through PCR.  To determine PCR specificity, the PCR product is subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. A specific DNA band can be observed, excised, and purified for further usage.Transcription of the DIG probe:Prepare the following reaction system:table:",
    "﻿Component,For 1 µg DNA\nDNA,1 µg\n10× transcription buffer,3 µl\nDIG-nucleotide mix,2 µl\nRiboLock RNase Inhibitor,1 µl\nT7 RNA polymerase,2 µl\nWater,to 30 µl\nTotal,30 µl",
    "Incubate the reaction at 37°C for 3 h in the thermocycler, with lid temperature no higher than 55°C.To remove the template DNA, add 0.5 µl DNase I to the reaction mix directly and mix well, then incubate the mix at 37°C for 15 min.Purify the acquired RNA transcript with MEGAclearTM Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions or perform phenol:chloroform extraction followed by alcohol precipitation manually. The RNA probes can be directly dissolved in nuclease free water.Sample rehydration, antigen retrieval, and permeabilizationRehydrate the embryos in graded methanol/PTW buffer (see Recipes) (75%, 50%, and 25% methanol in PTW) for 2-4 min in each concentration, allowing embryos to settle down to the bottom between changes. Wash embryos with PTW for 10 min twice.Note: Prepare graded series of methanol buffer right before use. Incubate the embryos in 6% H2O2/PTW solution at RT for 10 min, and then wash twice with PTW buffer.Dilute proteinase K in PTW buffer at a final concentration of 10 µg/ml proteinase K in the reaction mix. Remove PTW buffer thoroughly and incubate embryos in 10 µg/ml proteinase K reaction mix at RT. The reaction duration varies for different embryo stages. To specify, for embryos ranging from E7.0 to E9.0 embryos, the appropriate reaction duration should be 7-20 min, but longer times should be pre-tested for more advanced embryos. A pre-experiment for optimization of the conditions is strongly recommended.Remove proteinase K buffer carefully and rinse with PTW buffer twice.Post-fix the digested embryos in 4% PFA/0.1% glutaraldehyde fixation mix (see Recipes). Incubate the embryos for 20-30 min at RT.Remove the fixation buffer, and carefully wash with PTW buffer twice.Hybridization of RNA probes to the embryosWash the embryos with hybridization solution warmed at 68°C twice; add the hybridization solution (see Recipes) and allow embryos to equilibrate until they sink to the bottom.",
    "Incubate for 2-6 h at 65-72°C. The optimal temperature varies between different RNA probes. Usually, a 68°C hybridization temperature works for most probes we have tested.Remove the hybridization solution and replace with the probe diluted in hybridization solution (200-500 ng/ml). Incubate the embryos at their corresponding temperature overnight.Re-collect the probe. Probes in hybridization solution can be re-used 6-8 times. Re-collected probes can be stored at -20°C for up to two months.Wash embryos with hybridization buffer warmed at 70°C for 30 min three times.Wash embryos with 50% hybridization buffer/50% TBST buffer at 70°C for 20 min.Wash embryos with TBST buffer (see Recipes) on a rocker platform at RT three times.Antibody incubation and digoxygenin detectionPrepare blocking buffer (see Recipes) and incubate with embryos for 2-3 h at RT.Prepare antibody incubation reaction solution with 1:2,000 diluted anti-digoxigenin AP antibody in blocking buffer. Incubate on a rocker platform at 4°C overnight.Discard the antibody solution and wash the embryos with TBST buffer for 30 min three times. If required, wash the embryos with an extended overnight wash to reduce background signals.Wash the embryos twice with freshly made NTMT buffer (see Recipes).Discard the NTMT buffer and incubate embryos with NBT/BCIP solution (1:50 in NTMT buffer).Observe the signal frequently during the first two hours of NBT/BCIP solution incubation.Note: Refresh the NBT/BCIP solution if the solution turns red. Stop the reaction by rinsing the embryos in TBST approximately three times until an obvious signal appears.Fix the embryos in 4% PFA buffer overnight.Transfer the embryos into 50% glycerol/PBS, and record representative images of embryos samples (Figure 3).The post-fixed embryos can be store at 4°C for more than one year.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4229/bioprotoc-11-22-4229-g003.jpgFigure 3.

    "5 stages, from which Tal1 starts to be expressed in extraembryonic mesoderm cells, as indicated by the triangle at E7.0, and peaking at E7.5. Both embryos were stained with the same probe against the Tal1 transcript. The images were taken using an Olympus SZX10/16 microscope. Scale bars: 500 μm."
