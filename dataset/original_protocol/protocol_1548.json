The following steps are performed under sterile conditions.\nTransfer lymph node into a sterile mortar (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) and add 5 mL cell culture medium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1117-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Key steps of lymph node processing\n(A and B) Two different representative lymph nodes in a mortar (A) or on a saline-soaked compress (B) immediately after excision. B) Lymph node or excessive fat tissue is highlighted with blue or green arrows, respectively.\n(C) Lymph node in cell culture medium after being cut into small pieces.\n(D) Lymph node pieces in a cell strainer. Tube filled with approximately 50 mL medium containing lymph node-derived cells.\n(E) Pellet of lymph node-derived cells after centrifugation. Reddish stain indicates slight contamination with erythrocytes.\nRemove excessive fat and connective tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) using dissecting scissors or a scalpel.\nCut lymph node into small pieces of approx. 1–2 mm size using dissecting scissors and forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: The smaller the pieces, the higher the cell yield. However, for larger lymph node pieces, step 3 can be very time-consuming and defines the overall duration of this protocol. If you rely on fast processing rather than high cell yield, you can drastically shorten this step by cutting the lymph node into fewer pieces. We do not recommend using a pestle because it generates more debris.\nUsing a 5 mL serological pipette, thoroughly pipette up and down to gently wash out the lymphocytes.\nFilter lymphocyte-containing medium through a 100 μm strainer into a sterile 50 mL tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Add 5 mL cell culture medium and repeat steps 3–5 once or twice depending on the size of the lymph node. The strainer can be reused unless it becomes clogged.\nRinse cell strainer with fresh cell culture medium to fill up the tube to 50 mL.\nCentrifuge tube at 400 g for 5 min at 18°C–25°C.\nCarefully decant supernatant (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nOptional: At this step, lymph node-derived exosomes can be collected. To do so, the use of exosome-free FBS and cell culture medium is required in all preceding steps (Bordas et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nGently resuspend the pellet in 10 mL cell culture medium and pass cell suspension through 70 μm strainer.\nCentrifuge at 400 g for 5 min at 18°C–25°C.\nResuspend cells in cell culture medium. In case of clumps, repeat steps 10–12.\nCount cells and set 1 × 106 cells aside for quality control by flow cytometry (see below).\nOptional: After this step, cells can be used freshly for any subsequent assays.\nNote: For single cell (RNA) sequencing non-frozen cells might generally be the better option. However, single cell (RNA) library preparation is an elaborate process and rather inefficient if performed for only one sample at a time. In addition, batch effects could mask interpatient differences. Therefore, we freeze all samples before use.\nFill 2 mL cryotubes with 700 μL of cold freezing medium.\nDilute cell suspensions to desired cell concentration using cell culture medium, for instance 5 × 106 cells per 700 μL medium.\nAdd 700 μL cell suspension drop-wise to cryotubes and gently invert tubes a few times.\nPlace cryotubes quickly into a slow freezing container and store at −80°C for ≥ 24 h. Long-term storage should be below −150°C.",
    "Note: Depending on the total yield of cells, we freeze 5 × 106, 1 × 107, 2 × 107 and 5 × 107 cells per vial. Aliquot sizes can be adjusted depending on the planned set of experiments. Please see the section expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] for cell yield of an average lymph node sample.\nOutput control using flow cytometry\nTiming: 60–90 min\nIn order to check and document the cellular output, lymph node-derived cells are stained for viability, as well as basic B and T cell markers and analyzed on a flow cytometer. This step is crucial as the frequency of B and T cells varies significantly across patient samples.\nTransfer leftover 1 × 106 cells (from step 13) into a 5 mL flow cytometry tube.\nAdd 1 mL of washing buffer and centrifuge cells at 400 g for 5 min at 18°C–25°C.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend pellet in remaining buffer (ideally 50–100 μL). Then, add the antibodies, as shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1117_7.csv\nNote: Staining for kappa and lambda light chain enables quick detection of light chain-restricted populations proving the diagnosis of B cell lymphoma (Horna et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The same is true for co-expression of CD5 and CD19 (Hallek et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Quantification of B and CD4+/CD8+ T cells might help to plan future experiments. The staining panel can be adjusted according to the titration or availability of antibodies and the configuration of flow cytometer at your means. To detect the above mentioned fluorophores, the flow cytometer must be equipped with suitable lasers (as shown) and filters.\nBriefly vortex and incubate at 4°C protected from light for 30 min.\nAdd 1 mL of washing buffer, centrifuge cells at 400 g for 5 min and discard supernatant.\nRepeat for a total of three washes.",
    "Resuspend cells in 200 μL washing buffer.\nPut cells on ice and analyze them on a flow cytometer within 24 h. Please see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C for suggested gating strategy.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1117-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Quality control of lymph node processing\n(A) Lymph nodes were processed as described in the protocol and roughly grouped into four categories based on their size: fine needle biopsies, I (small piece), II (medium size piece), III (big piece) or IV (very big piece). The total number of harvested cells was compared to estimated size of the obtained lymph node piece. Box plots show minimum, first quartile, median, second quartile, and maximum.\n(B) The total number of harvested cells across different lymphoma entities. Box plots show minimum, first quartile, median, second quartile, and maximum.\n(C) Representative pseudocolor plots showing the usual output of harvested lymph node-derived lymphocytes.\nThawing lymph node-derived cells and dead-cell removal\nTiming: 60–90 min\nLymph node-derived cells are thawed using EDTA to prevent clumping of cells prior to removal of dead cells and library preparation for single cell sequencing. Until library preparation, the following steps are performed under sterile conditions.\nPre-warm water bath and EDTA-containing cell culture medium to 37°C.\nPrepare 50 mL tubes with 10 mL of EDTA-containing cell culture medium.\nNote: EDTA reduces the formation of cell clumps, and thereby increases the yield of viable cells after thawing.\nThaw frozen aliquots in pre-warmed water bath and quickly transfer cell suspension dropwise into the prepared tubes.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 5 min at 18°C–25°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in EDTA-free washing buffer.\nNote: This step aims to remove EDTA again from the cell suspension, as calcium is required for binding to the column of the dead-cell removal kit.\nFilter cell suspensions through 75 μm strainer.",
    "Count cells, for instance manually by means of trypan blue and a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 5 min at 18°C–25°C and discard supernatant.\nTo magnetically label the dead cells, resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL magnetic beads per 1 × 107 cells. For fewer than 1 × 107 cells, use 100 μL.\nIncubate for 15 min protected from light at 18°C–25°C.\nMeanwhile, prepare magnetic Multistand, OctoMACS™ separator, and one MS columns per sample (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1117-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Dead cell removal\n(A) Magnetic multistand with OctoMACS™ separator and two MS columns.\n(B) Columns are rinsed with 500 μL binding buffer (red arrow).\n(C) To collect flow-through 15 mL tubes are placed beneath each column.\n(D) 1000 μL binding buffer was add to each sample. Then, each sample (red arrow) is applied onto one column.\nNote: For single cell RNA sequencing, we strongly recommend the OctoMACS™ separator, as sequential handling of cells might confound gene expression profiles.\nWash each column with 500 μL 1X binding buffer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and wait until the liquid has passed the column. Put a tissue beneath the columns to soak up the flow-through.\nPlace 15 mL tubes under each column to collect the flow-through (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nAdd 1 mL 1X binding buffer to each sample and apply each sample onto one column (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nWait until the liquid has passed the column before rinsing each column with 500 μL 1X binding buffer. Wait until the liquid has passed the column.\nPerform a total of 4 washes in this way.\nCentrifuge the collected flow-through at 200 g for 5 min at 18°C–25°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in washing buffer and from here on handle them at 4°C.\nCount cells and assess viability, for instance by means of trypan blue and a hemocytometer.",
    "Note: In 10%–15% of all samples that we processed by this protocol, viability did not exceed 85%. In these cases, we reevaluate continuation of the protocol. To avoid unexpected termination of the planned follow-up experiment, we usually thaw and process an additional sample as back-up. It should generally be considered that when thawing a vial of a vial of 1 × 107 cells, only a median of 3.5 × 106 viable cells can be recovered. Please see the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section on how to optimize conditions if you encounter low viability or exorbitant loss of cells.\nOptional: At this step, cells can be labelled with barcoded antibodies. We do not recommend staining before removal of dead cells.\nContinue with library preparation for single cell sequencing according to the manufacturer’s protocol."
