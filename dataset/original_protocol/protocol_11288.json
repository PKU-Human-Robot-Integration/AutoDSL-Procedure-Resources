    "The methods described here were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Los Angeles. Wild-type (C57BL/6J) and mdx mice (C57Bl/10ScSn background) were purchased from a commercial source. mdx:utrophin-Tg mice were a gift from James Ervasti, with permission from Kay Davies, and were maintained on the mdx background. Ambulation assays were performed on male mice at 6 months of age. Mice were maintained in the Terasaki Life Sciences Vivarium following guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Los Angeles (approval #2000-029-43) and approval for these studies was granted by the UCLA Animal Welfare Assurance (approval #A3196-01).\n1. Preparation of Chamber\nPerform data collection in a quiet, temperature controlled room at a consistent time of day9. Perform the tests blinded to the genotype and treatment of the mouse being tested.\nAdapt any open field chamber system for this analysis.\n\tNOTE: In this study, we use an inexpensive and easily transportable recording chamber constructed from a large trash bin. The open field arena is a tray set on a cage or similar elevated platform.\nPlace the camera on a wire mesh above the chamber to record across the full arena.\nClean the recording chamber with disinfectant before each trial.\n2. Pre-exercise Protocol and Data Collection\nOptionally, immediately prior to activity recording, challenge each mouse with a muscle activation protocol.\n\tNOTE: This is optional but recommended in experiments involving mdx mice.\n\t\nAllow the mouse to grip the pull bar of a digital force gauge and gently pull back until the pull bar is released. Repeat this procedure five times per trial.\nRecord peak tension (N) for each trial.",
    "NOTE: In addition to serving as an exercise challenge for the ambulation assay, the force exerted by the animal during this grip strength assay can be used as an additional functional outcome measure2,10.\nPerform five total trials for each mouse with 1 min of rest between each trial.\nImmediately following the grip strength assay or other exercise protocol, place the mouse in the activity chamber.\nStart the video recording of the movement of the mouse in the chamber arena. Allow the mouse to freely explore for 6 min.\nStop the recording at 6 min and return the mouse to its home cage.\n3. Video Analysis\nOptionally, prepare video for analysis by reducing the frame rate. In order to reduce the frame rate for tracking analysis, use the following protocol in a video editing software (e.g., iMovie or similar program) to decimate the video frame rate by a factor of 2.\n\tNOTE: Depending on length and frame rate of the video, it may be useful to reduce the video frame rate prior to analysis. In this study, video was recorded at 30 frames/s (6 min recording, approximately 10,800 frames total).\n\t\nLoad the video into the software.\nUnder the 'Speed' menu, select 'Speed: Fast' and set speed to 2x.\nExport the decimated video in .mp4 file format for tracking analysis.\nOpen the video for analysis in the software program. Set the calibration for the video recording by using the line tool. Draw a line along one side of the chamber. Right click on the line and select \"Calibrate measureâ€¦\" Enter the actual size of the chamber side in centimeters.\nTo begin semi-automated tracking of the mouse position, click on the 'move' cursor.",
    "Starting at the initial frame in the video, right click on the point to be tracked; the tracking point is marked with a blue circle.\n\tNOTE: In the present study, the position of each animal was tracked by tracing the base of the tail.\nAdvance the frame by clicking the right arrow on the keyboard; the tracking point should automatically move based on the position of the tail base.\n\t\nIf the tracking position is not aligned with the point of interest in a given frame, manually align the blue circle to the base of the tail.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the quality of the video and the speed of the mouse, the tracking may require variable levels of user input to maintain alignment with the point of interest. The path of the mouse should advance through the course of the video.\nWhen tracking of the full video is complete, save the video and tracing overlay. Export the positional data of the tracing by selecting \"Export to Spreadsheet\".\n4. Data Analysis\nOpen the positional data in a spreadsheet software program. The movement analysis software reports the X,Y coordinate position of the mouse in each frame.\nTo calculate distance traveled by frame, use the following equation (where position in frame one is x1,y1 and frame two is x2,y2):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56772/56772eq1.jpg\n\tNOTE: Cumulative distance over time can be calculated by adding the distance traveled between each frame.\nSubscription Required.
