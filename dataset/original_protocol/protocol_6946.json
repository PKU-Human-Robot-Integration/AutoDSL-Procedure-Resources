    "C. elegans maintenanceInoculate an E. coli OP50 colony into 50 ml LB broth in a 200 ml flask and incubate with gentle agitation at 37°C overnight.Apply approximately 200 μl of OP50 liquid culture to a 60 mm NGM plate. Incubate seeded plates at room temperature for 3-7 days before use.Transfer 50-100 mixed-stage larval worms to a new OP50-seeded NGM plate using a heat-sterilized platinum wire pick. Keep worms at 20°C.Repeat Step A3 every 2-3 days for maintenance.C. elegans synchronization by bleachingCollect worms (maintenance plates at Day 3 usually have the maxium numbers of gravid adults) in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with 1 ml of M9 buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100.Centrifuge for 1 min at 200 × g and discard the supernatant.Add 0.5 ml bleaching solution (see Recipe 4) into the tube and shake gently at room temperature for up to 5 min. Monitor the extent of worm lysis under the dissecting microscope.Add 0.5 ml of M9 buffer to quench the bleaching process.Note: Avoid over-bleaching. Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,300 × g. Discard the supernatant.Repeat Steps B4 and B5 twice to wash off the bleach solution.Gently invert tubes and place two drops of 2-μl egg mixture on a clean microscope slide. Count eggs and determine the concentration of eggs.Place ~150 eggs on an OP50 seeded 60 mm NGM plate (2-3 plates for each strain/condition) and grow them at 20°C.Transfer synchronized worms to new OP50 plates every 2 days until they reach the desired stages.Oil Red O staining of wormsCollect synchronized 300 worms (from two 60 mm NGM plates) at the desired stage with M9 + 0.1% Triton X-100 in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Centrifuge for 1 min at 200 × g.",
    "Discard the supernatant, then wash the worms with 1 ml of M9, and centrifuge for 1 min at 200 × g. Repeat this step three times to wash off bacteria. Leave worms in 100 μl M9 buffer after the last wash.Prepare 1 ml of 2× MRWB buffer by adding 250 μl 16% paraformaldehyde to 750 μl MRWB stock solution.Fix worms by adding 100 μl 2× MRWB buffer (freshly prepared) to the tube containing worms in 100 μl of M9 buffer.Incubate samples at room temperature for 1 h. Gently invert the tubes every 15 min.Spin down worms and discard the supernatant.Add 1 ml of M9 + 0.1% Triton X-100, centrifuge for 1 min at 1,500 × g, and remove the supernatant. Repeat this step twice.For dehydration, add 1 ml of 60% 2-propanol and then incubate samples for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.While samples are under dehydration, prepare the Oil Red O working solution. Mix the Oil Red O stock solution (pre-heated in an 85°C water bath for 2 h) and ddH2O at a ratio of 3:2. Mix the working solution thoroughly. At this point, the mixed solution appears murky. The working solution should be made fresh from the stock solution each time.Filter the mix solution through a 0.22-μm syringe filter. Effluent should appear dark red but clear.Spin down dehydrated samples (from Step C8) at 1,500 × g for 1 min, and then discard the supernatant.Add 200 μl of Oil Red O working solution (from Step C10) into each tube. Incubate in the dark at 37°C for 4-6 h.Centrifuge at 1,500 × g for 1 min to pellet worms. Discard the staining dye.Wash with 1 ml of M9 + 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuge for 1 min at 1,500 × g. Repeat this step twice.",
    "After the last wash, leave 100 μl of the M9 solution. Store in the dark at room temperature until needed.Mount the worms on a glass slide with an agarose pad (2% w/v agarose in ddH2O) and visualize them under the microscope."
