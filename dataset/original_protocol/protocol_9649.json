    "1. Design device geometry\nChoose the width of the sizing and recovery segments so that it is wider than the diameter of the largest cells to be measured but also maintains a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). See Supplementary Table 2 for examples of different sizing and recovery segment widths for various cell lines.\nChoose the contraction segment width to apply a 30%-40% strain to the average size of the cells that are to undergo mechanophenotyping. Strain is defined as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64665/64665eq01.jpg, where d is cell diameter and wc is the contraction channel width2,8. See Supplementary Table 2 for different contraction segment widths for various cell lines.\n\tNOTE: If one wishes to compare cell types or conditions with substantially different diameters, separate device designs should be used with contraction segment widths specific to each cell type/condition.\nDesign a reference device for each unique device geometry. This is necessary for determining De, the effective diameter of the sizing pore segment of the microfluidic channel.\n\tNOTE: The reference device uses the same geometry as the primary device. The only modification is that the contraction segment should be equal in width to the sizing pore segment to allow for calibration with polystyrene beads of a known size. Widening the contraction prevents the polystyrene beads from clogging the contraction channel during calibration. The calibration process is further described in steps 4.1 and 5.3.1. Calibration can also be achieved using a commercially available cell counter, in which case, no reference device is needed. This process is described in step 4.2.",
    "Choose the channel height such that the largest cells of interest can fully elongate without restriction within the contraction segment2. Ensure that the channel height is larger than hmin imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64665/64665eq02.jpg (this assumes the cell is spherical pre-deformation, and that isometric deformation occurs along the channel length and height during deformation).\n\tNOTE: Given the magnitude of a current subpulse, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64665/64665eq3v2.png, the larger the hmin is, the lower the overall SNR will be.\nDesign and create a photomask using computer-aided design software with the chosen channel widths. An example file is provided in Supplementary File 1. Scale the microfluidic mask design by 1.5% to account for polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) shrinkage after peeling from the negative master.\n\tNOTE: An array of devices can be included on a single mask as long as the overall array does not exceed the size of the wafer (Supplementary Figure 1A).\nDesign and create a photomask with electrodes that will be used to perform a four-point probe measurement of the microfluidic device current (Figure 1D). An example file is provided in Supplementary File 1.\n\tNOTE: An array of electrodes can be included on a single mask as long as the array does not exceed the size of the glass slide (Supplementary Figure 1B).\n2. Fabricate devices (Figure 2)\nPrepare electrode patterns on a glass substrate.\n\t\nSpin coat, pattern, and process a positive photoresist onto a plain glass slide according to the product data sheet. An example of this procedure is outlined in Supplementary File 2.\nPerform metal deposition, lift-off, and gold etching.\n\t\t\nPerform thin film deposition of 75 Å Ti, 250 Å Pt, and 250 Å Au onto the slide. An example of this procedure using electron-gun evaporation is outlined in Supplementary File 3.\nImmerse the slide in acetone for 15 min to perform a lift-off of excess metal.",
    "In a fume hood, use a disposable pipette to drop-cast gold etchant onto the region of electrodes that will be exposed to the microfluidic channel, as shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Be cautious to avoid dropping etchant elsewhere on the slide.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: Gold etchant can cause skin and eye irritation. Do not breathe vapors, and do not ingest. Handle with care, wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and discard waste according to local disposal regulations.\nRinse the slide with deionized (DI) water and dry it with dry nitrogen (N2).\nIf multiple electrodes are printed on the same glass slide, dice the slide into individual chips.\n\t\t\nUse a glass cutting tool to score the slide along the patterned electrode boundaries.\nBreak the glass along the score to partition the slide into individual chips.\nVisually inspect the electrodes under a microscope. Ensure that individual electrodes are not electrically open or that electrodes are not shorted together.\nFabricate a negative master mold for channels.\n\t\nSpin coat, pattern, and process an SU-8 epoxy resist onto a polished silicon wafer according to the product data sheet. An example of this procedure is outlined in Supplementary File 2.\nMeasure feature heights using a profilometer and visually inspect the features under a microscope (Supplementary Figure 3). Ensure that the desired geometries are well-defined.\nMold PDMS channels with soft lithography.\n\t\nPrepare PDMS by weighing an elastomer and a crosslinker at a 10:1 mass ratio in a disposable cup.\n\t\tNOTE: For a wafer with a 3 in diameter, 30 g of PDMS is sufficient.\nMix the PDMS vigorously for 30 s with a disposable fork, until the PDMS is opaque with bubbles.\nDe-gas the PDMS in a vacuum chamber for approximately 30-90 min, or until the PDMS is transparent with no visible bubbles.",
    "Place the wafer with the SU-8 master mold into a disposable Petri dish and pour PDMS over the center of the wafer.\nPlace the Petri dish containing the PDMS and wafer in a vacuum chamber and de-gas for approximately 30 min, or until no bubbles remain in the PDMS.\nBake the PDMS at 80 °C for 2 h in an oven or on a hot plate.\nWith a sharp blade, cut and remove the PDMS from the SU-8 negative master.\nDice the molded PDMS slab into individual molds using a sharp blade\nCore the inlet and outlet access holes using a disposable biopsy punch. For best results, use a new punch for each PDMS slab. A sharper punch produces smooth-edged holes, minimizing particulates that could obstruct the contraction channel.\n\t\tNOTE: The diameter of the access holes should be slightly less than the outer diameter of the tubing. For example, if using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing with an outer diameter of 1/32 in, a 1.5 mm hole should be punched.\nBond a glass/electrode substrate to the PDMS channels.\n\t\nClean the electrode glass slides with methanol (≥99.8%). Dry with dry N2.\nClean the PDMS device with scotch tape, followed by a rinse with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionized water (DI; 18 MΩ/cm2). Dry with dry N2. Then, clean with scotch tape once more.\nPlace the glass substrate with prefabricated electrodes and the prepared PDMS mold (feature side up) into a plasma cleaner.\nExpose both to oxygen plasma for 2 min (100-300 mTorr, 30 W).\nAlign and place the PDMS mold with the feature side face-down onto the glass substrate with prefabricated electrodes.",
    "NOTE: Bonding is instantaneous once the plasma-treated PDMS and glass come into contact; consequently, further alignment modifications will not be possible. To facilitate alignment, 20 µL of a 2:1 dilution of methanol in DI water may be pipetted onto the plasma-treated glass surface. The methanol solution acts as a physical barrier between the treated glass and PDMS, allowing for alignment adjustments. If using methanol, bake the aligned and mated device at 50 °C for 2 h to evaporate the solution and complete the bonding process.\nVisually inspect the bonded device under a microscope. Ensure that the electrodes and channel geometries are properly aligned.\n3. Measure cells (Figure 1D)\nPrepare the pressure source, PCB, benchtop hardware, and data acquisition software.\n\t\nConnect the microfluidic device to the PCB using the clamp. An example of the PCB is provided in Supplementary File 4 (GERBER files) and Supplementary File 5 (schematic, board, and PCB parts list files).\n\t\t\nAlign the clamp's spring-loaded pins with the electrode contact pads on the microfluidic device and align the clamp's header pins with the holes on the PCB.\nFirmly insert the clamp's header pins into the PCB holes, making sure the spring-loaded pins stay aligned with the electrode contact pads.\nSet up and connect the electronic hardware.\n\t\t\nConnect two of the power supply's output ports to the PCB's supply voltage port with a double banana plug-to-Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) female adapter and a BNC cable.\nTurn on the power supply. Set the output connected to the BNC's inner conductor to +15 V and set the other output to -15 V. Enable both outputs to power the circuit.",
    "Connect the third of the power supply's output ports to the input voltage port of the PCB with a BNC cable. Set the output to the desired applied voltage, but do not enable it until starting the experiment.\nConnect the PCB's output current port to the input of the current preamplifier with a BNC cable.\nConnect the output of the current preamplifier to one analog input on the BNC terminal block of the data acquisition system with a BNC cable. Optionally, connect an analog low-pass filter in line with the BNC cable to filter out high-frequency interference.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To improve the SNR, the PCB and device may be housed within a thick metal enclosure. All BNC cables and fluidic tubing can be routed through holes drilled into the enclosure.\nInstall and set up the required software on the personal computer (PC)\n\t\t\nPower on and connect the pressure controller to the PC. Install any required pressure controller software as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nInstall MATLAB and the Data Acquisition Toolbox on the PC. Ensure the required drivers for the data acquisition system are installed so that the MATLAB Data Acquisition Toolbox interface can detect it.\nDownload the included data acquisition script, \"NPS.m\", from https://github.com/sohnlab/node-pore-sensing-public.\nOpen and configure the data acquisition script.\n\t\t\nSet the correct values to initialize the data acquisition session, which includes the Vendor ID, the DAQ's Device ID, and the analog input channel number (lines 34-36 in the included script).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The Device ID can be found using the function \"daq.getDevices\" or \"daqlist\".\nSet the desired sample rate for the acquisition (line 23 in the included script). For optimal results, it should be set to at least 10 kHz.\nPrepare the cell suspension.",
    "Prepare a solution of 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and filter with a 0.22 µm filter.\nCulture and prepare the cells according to the appropriate cell-culture protocol of the cell line of choice. Suspend the cells in the prepared solution of 2% FBS in 1x PBS at a concentration of 1-5 x 105 cells/mL. Keep the cells on ice for the duration of the experiments.\nMeasure the physical properties of the cells.\n\t\nLoad the cell sample into the tubing and connect it to the device inlet.\n\t\t\nCut 30 cm of PTFE tubing with a razor blade or sharp knife.\nAttach one end of the tubing to a luer lock syringe. Use the syringe to draw up the cell sample into the other end of the tubing.\nCarefully insert the tubing into the inlet of the device.\nConnect the opposite end of the tubing to the microfluidic pressure controller.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A filter can be added between the microfluidic pressure controller and the tubing to prevent liquid backflow into the pressure controller.\nRun the experiment.\n\t\t\nSet the desired constant driving pressure on the pressure controller software and allow the sample to fill the device.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The pressure is typically 2-21 kPa. The flow speed must be slow enough to allow for clearly defined pulses but fast enough to allow for adequate throughput.\n\t\t\t\nIf bubbles form in the microfluidic channels, use dead-end filling: plug the device outlet and apply a low pressure to the inlet to force air out through the gas-permeable PDMS. Leaving bubbles in the channel will lead to an unstable current baseline and prevent accurate measurements.",
    "If debris clogs the microfluidic channel, dislodge it by lightly pressing on the top of the PDMS device while applying the driving pressure, \"pulsing\" a higher pressure by toggling the pressure on and off, or removing the tubing and reinserting it. If the debris remains, it may be necessary to switch to a new device.\nSet the desired voltage by rotating the Voltage knob on the power supply and enable the voltage by pressing the On button.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Voltage is typically 1-5 V. Choose the lowest voltage necessary for an adequate SNR. The same voltage should be used across all conditions to be compared.\nTurn on the current preamplifier and set the sensitivity (A/V) as low as possible; alternatively, set the gain (V/A) as high as possible without overloading the preamplifier or exceeding the maximum analog input voltage of the DAQ. In this study, the sensitivity was set to 10-7 A/V.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The proper sensitivity/gain value will depend on both the applied voltage as well as the baseline resistance of the microfluidic channel.\nPress the green Run button in the MATLAB ribbon menu to begin the data acquisition script NPS.m and start sampling and saving the data.\nTo end the experiment, press the Stop button in the lower left corner of the figure window to stop the data acquisition script. Disable the power supply output by pressing the On button. Set the pressure source to zero pressure in the pressure controller software.\nAt this point, the experiment can be paused to do one or more of the following:\n\t\t\t\nReplace the current device with a new one.\nReload the tubing with more cell samples.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: To avoid sample cross-contamination, use new devices to measure cells of different types or conditions.",
    "Unclamp the device from the PCB and examine the channel's condition under a microscope. To restart the experiment using the same device, care must be taken not to introduce air bubbles. It may be necessary to apply gentle pressure to the syringe plunger to keep the cell sample at the very end of the tubing while inserting it into the device inlet.\n4. Calibrate the microfluidic device\nOption 1: Measure the polystyrene beads in reference devices.\n\t\nChoose a polystyrene bead size that is smaller than the sizing channel.\nAdd 1.5% Tween and polystyrene beads to the filtered PBS and FBS solution used during the cell experiments, at a concentration of 1-3 x 105 beads/mL.\nProceed with the experiment as outlined in section 3, using the reference device described in step 1.3, and apply the same voltage used during experimentation. Use the average magnitude of the current drop produced as beads transit the sizing pores and the known diameter of the beads to calculate De, as described in section 5.\nOption 2: Independently measure the cell size with a separate measurement device.\n\t\nInstead of following the protocol in step 4.1, use a commercially available cell size measurement instrument to measure the average size of cells in the sample. In this case, no reference device is needed. Use the average current drop produced as cells transit the sizing pore and the measured average cell diameter to calculate De as described in section 5.\n5. Analyze data to extract cell phenotypes\nNOTE: Data processing can be performed using the MATLAB command-line interface program file mNPS_procJOVE.m at https://github.com/sohnlab/NPS-analysis-JOVE. See Supplementary File 6 for more instructions.\nPreprocess the data (Figure 3A).\n\t\nCompute the measured electrical current by applying the gain value used in the current-to-voltage preamplifier to the raw data acquired by the DAQ.",
    "Remove high-frequency noise by applying a rectangular smoothing function and/or a low-pass filter to the raw current measurement. Then, resample the filtered data to a lower sample rate. Also, compute the corresponding timestamp data at this lower sample rate.\nCompute a fitted baseline current signal by applying a method such as asymmetric least-squares smoothing26.\nCompute the approximate first derivative (difference signal) of the preprocessed current data by taking the difference between subsequent data points.\nIdentify cell events and extract subpulse data (Figure 3B).\n\t\nSearch for candidate cell events by examining the preprocessed data. Reject cell events that overlap with other cell events (i.e., coincidence events) (Supplementary Figure 4), exhibit a poor baseline fit, or have an unexpected or erroneous pulse shape (e.g., where a clog may have been present in the channel).\nExtract subpulse data for each cell event.\n\t\t\nEach node-pore segment will appear as a corresponding subpulse within the overall signal pulse (Figures 1B, C). Identify the start of each subpulse by computing the timepoint when the difference signal reaches a local minimum value. Identify the end of each subpulse by computing the timepoint when the difference signal reaches a local maximum value.\nDetermine the width of each subpulse as the elapsed time between the start and end time points. Determine the amplitude of each subpulse by computing the mean of the difference between the measured current and the baseline current for all data points between the start and end time points.\nDetermine the cell mechanophenotype for each cell event based on subpulse data.\n\t\nDetermine the cell diameter d based on the equation defined by Deblois and Bean24:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64665/64665eq04.jpg",
    "where ΔI/I is the mean ratio of subpulse amplitude to baseline current in the sizing subpulses, De is the effective diameter of the channel (measured in step 4), and L is the total length of the node-pore channel.\n\t\t\nDe is determined by calculating the average ΔI/I produced by a set of particles of a known diameter (either cells or beads, see step 4), using that known diameter as d, and solving Eq. 1 for De. \nQuantify the cell's resistance to deformation.\n\t\t\nDetermine the fluid velocity Uflow by calculating the mean cell velocity in the sizing subpulses, using the known segment lengths and measured duration of each subpulse.\nDetermine the whole-cell deformability index (wCDI), defined by Kim et al.2 as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64665/64665eq05.jpg\n\t\t\twhere Lc is the length of the contraction segment, hchannel is the channel height, and ΔTc is the duration of the contraction subpulse.\nIdentify the cell's recovery time from deformation, defined as the first recovery subpulse with an amplitude within 8% of the mean amplitude from the sizing subpulse2.\nCalculate the cell's transverse deformation within the contraction segment.\n\t\t\nCalculate the effective diameter of the contraction segment (De,c) as defined by Kim et al.2: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64665/64665eq06.jpg, where wc is the width of the contraction segment and wnp is the width of all other segments.\nCalculate the equivalent spherical diameter dc of the cell within the contraction by again using the equation defined by Deblois and Bean24:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64665/64665eq07.jpg\n\t\t\twhere ΔIc/Ic is the ratio of subpulse amplitude to baseline current in the contraction subpulse and Lc is the length of the contraction segment.\nCalculate the cell's elongation length Ldeform as described by Kim et al.2:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64665/64665eq08.jpg\nFinally, compute the cell's transverse deformation δdeform, which is defined by Kim et al.2 to be imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64665/64665eq09.jpg.\nSubscription Required.
