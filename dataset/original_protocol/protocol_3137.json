    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSurgical sampling, tissue processing, and initiation of organoids culture\nTiming: 4–6 h\nTo initiate organoid culture from solid tumor deposits of EOC, perform tissue dissociation and cell isolation on fresh material to maximize the preservation of progenitors' capacity in vitro. This section outlines a step-by-step approach to seed primary isolates in different media and 2D to 3D vs. direct 3D seeding format, to identify optimal organoid-forming conditions for each patient.\nTransfer the tissue to a Petri dish, within a cell culture Laminar flow.\nWash extensively in PBS without Ca++, Mg++.\nHomogenize with scissors.\nNote: Samples are transported directly to the lab where cell isolation protocol is immediately implemented. However, it is possible to store tissue samples within a collection medium for up to 20 h at 4°C without negatively affecting organoid forming efficiency or longevity of the culture.\nCollect small fragments (3–5 mm) into Cryo tubes and perform snap freezing in liquid nitrogen.\nFurther, put 1–2 fragments into formalin for fixation (24 h) and embed them in paraffin for comparative staining with organoids.\nMince further the remaining tissue with a scalpel to maximize mechanical dissociation before enzymatic digestion. It is recommended that during homogenization tissue is soaked in PBS, to avoid a drying-out effect.\nDigest tissue in PBS (w/o Ca++ and Mg++) + collagenase I (stock solution 5 U/μL, final con 1U/μL) + Y-27632 3 μM final concentration.\nNote: Define the volume of the digestion mixture based on the amount of tissue sample. For optimal results, 2 cm3 of the tumor should be dissociated in a total of 15 mL in a 50 mL Falcon tube. If tissue material is limited (e.g., biopsies) downscale the volume of the digestion accordingly. Biopsy samples require only 2–3 mL of enzymatic solution to achieve adequate dissociation.",
    "Incubate 1.5 h in a 37°C water bath with sporadic vigorous vortexing (every 20 min for 10 s) to enhance dissociation.\nInactivate and wash with 15 mL ADF++. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 g.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 5 mL new ADF++, and filtrate through the cell strainer 400 μm into the fresh 50-mL-Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 300 g.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 5 mL RBC Buffer, and incubate in the water bath for 5 min.\nStop lysis with 5 mL ADF++ and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 g.\nResuspend pellet in 3 mL ADF++.\nCell counting Neubauer Chamber or automatic cell counter.\nFor manual counting, dilute the cell suspension 1:2 with Trypan blue (for example 10 μL of the sample+ 10 Trypan blue), to determine the number of viable cells.\nFill the sample in the Neubauer counting chamber and evaluate the number of cells in 4 big squares.\nCalculate the cell yield per mL, by averaging the number of cells per square, factoring in dilution, and multiplying by 104.\nFor direct 3D seeding (Graphical abstract) Seed 30 000 cells per 25 μL Cultrex in 48-well format according to the scheme.\nCalculate the total number of cells needed for all Cultrex wells and separate accordingly ADF++ cells suspension to the new tube. Spin down the cells for 5 min at 300 g and remove the supernatant. Add cold Cultrex at an appropriate amount (250 μL for 10 wells in 48-well format).\nDistribute isolates in Cultrex droplets (25 μL) to the pre-warmed empty 48-well plate.\nMake sure to thoroughly mix the cells in the Culturex without creating bubbles.\nIncubate the plate for a minimum of 30 min at 37°C so that Cultrex solidifies.\nAdd appropriate growth medium, 250 μL per well.",
    "Note: This is an optional format. 24 well format with 50 μL of Cultrex and 50 000 seeded cells per well can also be chosen.\nRemaining cells 1 × 106 seed to T75 Flask in the 2D medium.\nIf fewer cells are available consider seeding in the T25 flask.\nAllow cells in the flask to adhere to the 3–5 days. Do not change the medium first 72 h.\n2D to 3D transfer and evaluation of organoid growth\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nThis section describes how primary isolates isolated and expanded in 2D are transferred to 3D cell culture, and how to perform a comparative assessment of organoid growth under different conditions.\nDetach cells, by washing the monolayer 2× with 5 mL PBS followed by 1 mL of TrypLE.-Incubate 10 min at 37°C.\nDetermine cell number as in 13) and seed as in 14).\nImage the cultures (directly seeded in 3D or organoids derived after 2D/3D transfer) at least 1× per week to document long-term growth.\nSelect the best medium condition for the long-term expansion at 14–21 days post-isolation.\nWait at least 14 days before classifying the sample as “no growth” as the speed of organoid formation varies substantially between donors.\nIf organoid growth is observed in several media expand all conditions, differences in growth pattern are in some cases apparent only during extended passaging.\nCritical: Do not propagate primary isolates in 2D culture, by splitting. Perform a transfer to Cultrex BME 2 in passage 0 as soon as cells reach confluency.",
    "Critical: Tissue fragments are being selected and retrieved by an experienced gynecologic oncologist during multi-visceral surgery for ovarian cancer (primary debulking, interval debulking following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or surgery for recurrent disease), diagnostic laparoscopy, or by CT-directed biopsy. If possible, preferred localizations with viable tumor load include the peritoneum of the abdominal wall, pelvis, paracolic gutter, and diaphragm, as well as adnexa and greater omentum (obviously necrotic areas in large tumor nodules should be disregarded, e.g., omental cake). Place tissue fragments immediately after surgery in the falcon with collection medium and prepared for transport at 4°C (transport box with cool packs).\nPassaging of organoids, long-term cultivation, and biobanking\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nThis section describes how to perform the long-term expansion of organoid lines by enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation. For optimal biobanking, preserve new lines when organoids have been sufficiently expanded to enable the generation of several stock vials. The availability of multiple stocks from each donor line safeguards long-term experimental planning. As freezing and thawing are associated with a certain degree of cell loss, pool 2–3 wells per 1 stock vial.\nAdd 250 μL of cold ADF++ medium (in 48-well format) or 500 μL for 24 well and thoroughly scrape the bottom of the plate with a pipette tip with intermittent pipetting up and down, to ensure that Cultrex is disrupted. Transfer cell suspension to 15 mL Falcon, add an additional 1 mL of cold ADF++, mix, and keep on ice.\nYou can pool technical replicate wells 2–3 together to ensure even expansion.\nSpin down the organoids for 5 min at 300 g.\nDiscard the supernatant and if the Cultrex layer is still visible on top of the pellet repeat the washing step.\nAdd 1 mL of TrypLE (stored at 20°C–25°C).",
    "Incubate in a water bath for 7–10 min. Periodic vortexing for 10 s is recommended to improve the efficiency of dissociation. If large cell aggregates are still present (visible against the light in the falcon tube) you can passage the suspension 3–5 times through a 1 mL cannula with a 27G syringe.\nNote: Passing through the syringe is optional, and can be performed with needles in the range of 23 gauge to 27 gauge depending on the requirement for the dissociation efficacy. Dissociation to smaller clumps and single cells does improve the uniformity of the suspension and leads to lower variability between the wells.\nAdd 1 mL of cold ADF++ to stop the reaction.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 300 g.\nRemove supernatant.\nAdd an appropriate volume of Cultrex. For example for the 50 μL of parental passage (1 × 24 well) resuspend in 150 μL of fresh Cultrex to achieve a 1:3 split.\nPipet up and down carefully and distribute to the prewarmed plate.\nAfter incubation of min 30 min at 37°C add medium, 500 μL per well.\nMedium change 2× per week.\nMake pictures in regular intervals of the cultures to allow for systematic comparisons between different conditions.\nIf organoid formation efficiency is similar in different media, consider long-term passaging of multiple conditions. In many cases, clear differences in expansion potential are obvious only after >1 month of cultivation.\nCritical: Make sure that ADF++ is properly cooled before harvesting the organoids and that mixing steps are thoroughly performed. The efficiency of removal of the extracellular matrix which dissolves below 4°C is critical for optimal dissociation of the cells in the subsequent steps.",
    "Critical: When removing the medium in step 28 try to leave as little as possible residual liquid as it dilutes the Cultrex BME2 and could increase the fragility of the droplets.\nCryopreservation of organoids\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the procedure for freezing organoid lines. As freezing and thawing are associated with a certain degree of cell loss, 2–3 wells should be pooled per 1 stock vial.\nIdentical to step 23.\nTake 1.8 mL Nunc cryovials, label them (name, passage, kind of medium, date of freezing), and put them on ice. Precool also the freezing medium (Cryo SFM) on ice.\nAdd 1 mL of CryoSFM to the organoid pellet and transfer to cryo tubes.\nStore the tubes in precooled Mr. Frosty and place them at −80°C overnight.\nTransfer the stock tubes to regular −80°C storage.\nFor long-term stable storage (>2 months) transfer the stocks to liquid nitrogen.\nNote: We recommend the freezing of the organoids in the first week after passaging within the proliferative stage while fixing the organoids, and imaging analysis should be performed 10–14 days after the split when organoids are differentiated and reach optimal size.\nThawing of the organoids\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes how to bring organoids into the culture after long-term storage.\nLabel and prepare a 15 mL falcon with prewarmed 9 mL ADF++.\nTake the sample out of the −80°C freezer or liquid nitrogen and transfer it small table container prefilled with liquid nitrogen.\nTransfer Organoid-stock carefully to a 37°C warm water bath while shaking softly.\nTransfer organoid suspension drop by drop to the prepared falcon with 9 mL ADF++, and mix carefully.\nSpin down for 5 min at 300 g.\nIdentical to steps 28–31.\nFixation of organoids and embedding in HistoGel\nTiming: 2 h",
    "This section describes the procedure of organoid fixation and preparation for embedding in paraffin, by using HistoGel.\nCollect organoids like in step 23.\nAdd 3 mL of 4% PFA and incubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash two times with 5 mL PBS with spinning down the organoids for 3 min at 300 g.\nResuspend in 4 mL fresh PBS and store at 4°C until embedding.\nPause point: Fixed organoids are stable, and can be kept in the fridge for 1 month before embedding.\nPrewarm HistoGel (stored at −20°C) in the heat block at 65°C.\nFixed organoids are usually sedimented at the bottom of the falcon and are visible so supernatant can be easily removed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). If the pellet is disrupted during handling, centrifuge briefly (3 min at 300 g) and then remove PBS.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2908-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of the fixed organoids for the paraffin embedding\nAdd 100 μL of warm Histogel pipet up and down and transfer to the piece of Parafilm, leaving it to solidify at 20°C–25°C. around 15 min.\nTransfer the firm droplet to the tissue Paraffin cassette.\nProceed according to standard tissue embedding protocols.\nCut 5–10 μm thick slices with a microtome, and mount them on slides.\nDry slides for 1 h at 65°C.\nStore them until stained in a dry place.\nCritical: Embedding in HistoGel simplifies the embedding procedure and enables identical downstream workflow as for tissue fragments (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1.
