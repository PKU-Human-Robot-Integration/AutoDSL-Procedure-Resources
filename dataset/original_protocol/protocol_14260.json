    "All procedures described here were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academies Press. 2011), and they were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Adult Zebrafish Preparation\nSet up sufficient breeding pairs in crossing tanks to acquire at least twice as many as the total fish needed for DOX injection. If comparing fish with different genetic backgrounds, breed all fish within the same week to ensure age-matched controls.\nCollect the fish embryos the next morning, transfer them to 100 mm Petri dishes, and keep them in a 28.5 °C incubator. Keep embryos at a low density (<100 embryos/Petri dish).\nRefresh the embryo water daily to avoid sex imbalance, and manually remove dead eggs in a timely fashion using a transfer pipette.\nPut the same number of embryos in each tank (for example, 60 embryos/3 L medium tank initially) to ensure density-matched controls.\nStart paramecia feeding at 4 days post-fertilization (dpf).\nInspect the fish daily during the juvenile stage. Adjust the fish number as needed to ensure similar fish density.\nWhen fish reach 4 weeks of age, transfer up to 20 fish into each new 3 L medium tank for further growth. Start to feed the fish with live hatched brine shrimp.\n2. Preparation and Storage of DOX Stock Solution\nNOTE: DOX can be purchased from various bio-companies. The compound is usually acquired as a powder in dark brown containers.\nThoroughly dissolve the DOX powder in de-ionized water to ensure no clumps are visible, with a final concentration of 5 mg/mL as the stock solution. Aliquot 1 mL of DOX stock into each 1.5 mL safe-lock tube. Wrap the 1.5 mL tubes with aluminum foil paper to protect the DOX from light exposure.",
    "NOTE: Perform this step in a chemical hood.\nKeep the DOX stock solution at 4 °C for storage. For long-term storage (>4 weeks) of DOX stock solution, perform the optional Section 3 described below.\n3. Quality Control of DOX Using Zebrafish Embryos (Optional)\nNOTE: DOX is both moisture- and light-sensitive, so it can lose its drug efficacy for modeling DIC after extended storage. For DOX purchased from different companies, or even different batches from the same company, it is useful to calibrate its drug efficacy using wild-type (WT) zebrafish embryos before conducting the experiments on adult fish. This method is derived from a reported zebrafish embryonic DIC model21.\nCollect WT zebrafish embryos from at least 2 pairs of fish. Dechorionate embryos at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) manually by using a syringe with a micro needle. Alternatively, treat the embryo with proteinase K at final concentration of 10 µg/mL for 10-15 min in a 30 °C incubator. Refresh the embryo water after dechorionation. Remove dead embryos and maintain at least 36 embryos of each batch.\nDilute the DOX stock solution in fresh embryo water to a final concentration of 100 µM. The volume of solution is 100 µL for every 3 embryos. Mix the diluted DOX solution by vortex. The final diluted solution should be a light, red color.\nAdd 100 µL/well of diluted DOX solution of a clean 96-well transparent plate.\nTake 3 dechorionated embryos with a plastic transfer pipette, and keep the embryos close to the end of the pipette tip. Put the pipette tip into each well with DOX solution. Let the end of the tip touch the solution and allow the embryos to swim into the well.\n\tNOTE: Avoid manually pushing the embryos, which will add more water into the well and dilute the DOX solution.",
    "Refresh the DOX solution at 48 hpf. By this time, observe the wells under a microscope with 10X magnification to identify dead embryos (cessation of heartbeat) or embryos with edema. Count and remove any dead embryos in a timely fashion, otherwise the remaining embryos exposed to the solution with dead embryos can die quickly as well.\nCheck the embryos at 72 hpf and count them. The DOX treatment is considered \"good drug efficacy\" if >25% death (cessation of heartbeat) can be observed in both batches of embryos.\n4. Pre-injection Preparation\nNOTE: Fish of 8 weeks to 6 months of age are used for DOX injection. The body weights (BWs) of a matured Wild Indian Karyotype (WIK) fish to be injected can range from 0.2-0.5 g.\nFast the fish for 24 h before injection.\nAnesthetize the fish with embryo water containing 0.16 mg/mL tricaine. Use a clean filter paper to dry the water from both sides of the body. Measure the BW of each fish on a scale. Group fish within 10% difference in BW together for later injection.\n\tNOTE: To minimize the workload at this step, fish within 10% difference in BW are considered the same size; therefore, prepare one DOX working solution according to their mean BW.\nPlan to inject each adult fish with 5 µL of solution. Calculate the DOX working concentration according to the fish numbers and BWs.\n\tNOTE: To study chronic cardiotoxicity up to 6 months, use DOX at a dose of 20 mg/kg. To study acute cardiotoxicity of DOX, the DOX dose can be increased up to 50 mg/kg of BW.\nDilute the DOX stock in 1x Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) for corresponding working concentrations. Vortex to mix the solution. Briefly spin down to collect the solution.\n5. DOX Injection in Adult Fish",
    "Place a clean 100 mm Petri dish with a sponge inside it, under a dissection microscope, then adjust the focus. Cut the sponge to make a cavity of about 4 cm in length to hold a fish. Make a longer cavity for a larger fish.\nPrepare a 34 G needle with a 10 µL micro-syringe. Rinse the needle with 1x HBSS buffer to remove any bubbles and blocks from the syringe and tubing.\nAnesthetize the adult fish in embryo water containing 0.16 mg/mL tricaine for 2 min.\n\tNOTE: Prolonged anesthetization over 5 min followed by DOX injection can easily cause fish death.\nSoak the sponge in embryo water with tricaine, and transfer the fish onto the sponge for injection.\nPerform IP DOX injection by either of the two methods described below.\nClassic IP injection29\nPosition the fish with the abdomen up in the cavity of the sponge. Quickly insert the needle, with a 45° angle to the fish body into the midline between the pelvic fins, and penetrate approximately 1-2 mm. Release all DOX solution slowly. Wait 5 s before pulling out the needle. Check the DOX delivery by a visible red color in the fish belly.\nAlternative IP injection\n\t\t\nPlace the fish laterally onto the sponge with the anterior to the right. Gently stabilize the fish using a blunt end forceps with the left hand, and hold the micro-syringe with the right hand.\nPosition the needle below the lateral line above the pelvic fin, with the bevel facing up. Pointing at the 7 o'clock position at a 45° angle, insert the needle 3-4 mm to the fish cavity located between the pelvic and the anal fins, and then slowly depress the plunger. Check the DOX delivery by a visible red color in the fish belly.",
    "Quickly transfer the injected fish to a clean crossing tank filled with fresh system water to allow the fish to recover. Rinse the needle once with 1x HBSS buffer between injections.\n6. Post-injection Fish Management\nAfter injection, return the fish to the system with running circulation. If possible, maintain DOX-treated fish separately from the main system to avoid cross-contamination among different tanks that share the circulation.\nFast the injected fish for another 24 h for recovery. Observe the fish daily during the first week. Remove the dead fish in a timely fashion to avoid infection to the other fish.\n\tNOTE: Fish deaths within the first 24 h are likely due to physical lesions caused by the injection.\nFurther maintain the DOX-stressed fish for longitudinal observations. Remove dead fish in time to avoid infections to other fish in the tank.\n\tNOTE: Fish numbers are documented to generate a survival curve.\nUse different experimental assays to phenotype the DOX-stressed fish, such as echocardiography30, cardiac function reporter transgenic line23, swimming challenge26, and quantification of other pathological remodeling markers23.\nSubscription Required.
