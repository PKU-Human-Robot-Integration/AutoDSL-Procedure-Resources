    "Caution: Consult all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use. Several of the chemicals used in this protocol are toxic and corrosive. Use appropriate practices when performing the extraction of tRNA using phenol, including the use of a fume hood and personal protective equipment (safety glasses, gloves, lab coat, full-length pants, closed-toe shoes, etc.). This protocol uses a non-toxic nucleic acid stain. The use of alternative stains may require additional precautions and specialized disposal of the staining agent if toxic and/or carcinogenic (e.g., ethidium bromide).\n1. Preparation of the Agarose Gel\nWeigh 2 g of agarose and add it to a glass bottle to prepare a 2% w/v agarose gel.\nAdd 100 mL of 1x tris-borate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (TBE) running buffer to the agarose-containing bottle. Melt by heating in a microwave. At 30 s intervals, swirl the contents to mix well and repeat this step until the agarose is completely dissolved. Allow the agarose solution cool down to approximately 50-60 °C.\nTape the open edges of a gel tray to create a mold, place an appropriate comb to create the wells and cast the molten agarose into it. Avoid bubble formation and let it solidify at room temperature.\nOnce solidified, place the gel tray in an electrophoresis unit and fill it with TBE buffer until the gel is fully covered.\n2. Preparation of the tRNA\nExpress tRNA(UUU) in E. coli\nIn the morning, use a vial of frozen E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the expression vector pET23d-EcUUU2 (harbors the gene encoding E. coli tRNA(UUU)), to streak a low-salt Luria Broth (LB) plate supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Invert the plate and place it into a 37 °C incubator until colonies appear (late afternoon).",
    "Inoculate one well-grown, single colony in 5 mL LB plus 100 µg/mL ampicillin and grow overnight at 220 rpm at 37 °C.\nThe next morning, pellet the cells (6,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C), replace medium with 5 mL fresh LB plus 100 µg/mL ampicillin and resuspend. Use this suspension to inoculate 200 mL LB plus 100 µg/mL ampicillin. Grow for 5 h at 220 rpm at 37 °C.\nWhen the optical density of the culture at 590 nm (OD590) has reached 0.6 - 0.8, add 1 mM IPTG to the culture to trigger the expression of the tRNA(UUU) gene. Incubate at 37 °C for 3 h.\nHarvest the cells by centrifuging the culture at 6,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nLysis and extraction\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL lysis buffer (0.3 M sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA). From this point onward, used autoclaved buffers and keep all the tRNA-containing samples at 4 °C to prevent tRNA degradation.\nAdd 1 volume of acid phenol (pH 4.3) to the resuspended cell pellet in the fume hood. Mix for 1 min by inversion to lyse the cells and centrifuge at 10,000 x g (10 min, 4 °C).\nCollect the upper aqueous phase containing the soluble tRNA(UUU) (and smaller concentrations of the other tRNA pools) using a pipette taking care not to aspirate the organic (bottom) phase. Discard the bottom layer and the pellet, which consists of the organic phase and cell debris, into an adequate container.\nPrecipitate the tRNA by thoroughly mixing the soluble (aqueous) phase with 2.5 volume 100% v/v ethanol by inversion for 1 h at 4 °C. Centrifuge the mixture at 15,000 x g (30 min, 4 °C).",
    "Decant the supernatant carefully and resuspend the tRNA-rich pellet in 4 mL gel filtration buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EDTA). Run 5 µL of the resuspended tRNA pool on a 2% w/v agarose gel.\n\t\tNOTE: Good quality tRNA appears as a single band (molecular size between 50-100 bp).\nPurification of tRNA(UUU)\nFollowing standard chromatographic practice12, load the resuspended tRNA(UUU) onto a high-resolution preparative gel filtration column (dimensions: 16 x 600 mm, bed volume: 120 mL, resolution range: 1,000-70,000 Da) previously equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (mobile phase). Set the flow rate to 1 mL/min to elute the samples.\n\t\tNOTE: The tRNA(UUU) peak elutes approximately at 75.5 mL. Typically, a yield of 0.5-1.0 mg/L tRNA of culture can be obtained.\nAnalyze the samples at representative elution volumes by electrophoresing 5 - 10 µL of each sample on a 2% w/v agarose gel.\n3. Sample Preparation\nExpress and purify TcdA according to López-Estepa et al.2.\n\tNOTE: Up to 250 µM TcdA can be used for the study.\nPipette the corresponding amount of TcdA as per Table 1 into properly labeled 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Add 1.6 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (final concentration) and gently mix using a pipette. Close the lid and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 10 µM of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 50 mM MgCl2 (final concentrations). Mix with a pipette and incubate the mixture for 5 min at room temperature.\nAdd purified tRNA(UUU) (section 2.3) as per Table 1, mix with a pipette and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd phosphate buffered saline (PBS) up to 100 µL final volume. Mix properly and add glycerol to a final concentration of 10% v/v.",
    "Vortex the sample and briefly spin down the contents of the tube (10,000 x g, 1 min, 4 °C).\n4. Gel Loading and Electrophoresis Development\nPlace electrophoresis unit into a tray filled with crushed ice to maintain the chamber at 4 °C during the electrophoresis run.\nCarefully, pipette 5 µL of each sample into the corresponding well. Add a suitable DNA size marker.\nPlug the electrodes into the corresponding slots of the power supply unit. Turn on the power supply unit and set the voltage to 100 V and run the gel for 90 min.\n5. Gel Staining to Observe tRNA-Protein Interaction\nPrepare the staining solution by mixing 50 mL of TBE with 1x of a suitable DNA stain. Avoid exposing the staining solution to sunlight by covering the staining container with aluminum foil.\n\tNOTE: DNA stains are usually stored as 10,000 or 20,000x concentrated stocks.\nAfter 90 min of electrophoresis, carefully remove the gel from the tray and place it in a container with staining solution. Place it on a rocker at low rocking speed at room temperature for 30 min.\nRemove the agarose gel from the staining container, tap it carefully on a piece of cellulose tissue or filter paper to remove excess liquid, and place it directly on a transilluminator. Switch on the UV light to visualize bands containing tRNA. Take a photograph of the gel.\nProtein staining (optional).\nDiscard the DNA staining solution safely (according to safety procedures) and substitute it with 50 mL Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) solution. Place the tray on a rocker at room temperature and stain overnight (>12 h). Discard the CBB staining solution and replace it with 50 mL PBS to remove excess dye. Destain for 1 h on a rocker.",
