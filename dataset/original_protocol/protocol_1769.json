    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAmplification of library pool\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes the resuspension, amplification, quality control and clean-up of the library pool or library subsets.\nNote: Library pools can contain several subsets planned with different primer pairs to allow amplification and downstream applications separately.\nResuspend the oligo library pool as follows:\nSpin down the tube for 2 min at 18.000 g at 18°C–25°C (MicroCL 17R Microcentrifuge or similar).\nAdd 200 μL TE (Tris-EDTA, pH 8) and vortex for 30 s at medium speed.\nIncubate at 65°C for 10 min.\nDivide to aliquots and freeze at −20°C.\nNote: We use 200 μL TE for libraries ranging between ∼0.4–0.8 pmol (for example, a 212 ng library of 200 nt length). For drastically different library sizes, TE volume should be adjusted. We recommend using 25–50 μL TE for each 0.1 pmol of the library.\nSet up adequate PCR conditions on one pool or subset before amplifying the samples on a large scale.\nNote: We recommend trying different dilutions and/or cycle numbers, to find the minimal necessary amplification for adequate DNA amount. Over-amplification can lead to the accumulation of mutations and reduce library complexity, while under-amplification leads to inefficient cloning due to low amounts of DNA. Using highly concentrated DNA can lead to unspecific amplification. For example, try 10 and 14 cycles after a 1:10 or 1:50 dilution of the pool for a single reaction, before proceeding with the large-scale amplification.\nNote: If a subset makes up a smaller part of a pool (e.g. 20%) adjust the dilutions accordingly, in fractions of 10% or smaller it is worth examining the use of an undiluted sample.",
    "Note: The forward and reverse primers used here (See the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for the sequence) are not specific to this plasmid or experiment and can be added to any library and used for amplification. It is possible to design and use any other primer, but we recommend testing if the designed primer works efficiently on a single sequence before ordering the library pool. For primer design, we recommend using primer3 (Koressaar and Remm 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Untergasser et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]): https://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/[href=https://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/].\nNote: See the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section for the rationale and alternatives of polymerase selection.\nPrepare PCR reaction mixture for one sample or subset.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1358_2.csv\nRun PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1358_3.csv\nRun 5 μL of the PCR product on a 2% agarose e-gel. Select the sample that gives a strong single band of the expected size with the minimum number of cycles and low background (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for potential solutions if no band is visible at this point.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1358-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Amplification of an oligo pool\n(A) PCR product with 10-fold or 50-fold dilution of the ssDNA pool and 14 cycles. M: marker. As the 1:10 dilution did not have more background than the 1:50 dilution, it was selected for the large-scale amplification.\n(B) PCR product of 5 reactions of oligo pool amplification with a 1:10 dilution. The expected fragment size is 159 nt and there is no background.\nNote: Throughout the protocol, a regular 2% agarose gel can be used instead of the e-gel. As the e-gel is very sensitive, using a regular agarose gel requires loading 3–6 times higher amounts of DNA than the e-gel.\nAmplify library pool or subsets.",
    "Re-run PCR with the optimized conditions. For each pool or subset, prepare 5 reactions (or more, according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) to minimize biases and allow equal amplification of all sequences.\nPool PCR reactions for each set (5∗50 μL = 250 μL total volume).\nRun 5–20 μL (depending on the strength of the band in the trial PCR) of the 250 μL on a 2% agarose e-gel. Proceed if the band strength and size are as expected (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nClean up PCR products on QIAQuick PCR purification columns from Qiagen, according to the manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.qiagen.com/cn/resources/download.aspx?id=e0fab087-ea52-4c16-b79f-c224bf760c39&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/cn/resources/download.aspx?id=e0fab087-ea52-4c16-b79f-c224bf760c39&lang=en]\nAt the end elute DNA in 30 μL DNase free water, then re-elute in another fresh 20 μL (total volume 50 μL) to ensure collecting all of the DNA.\nMeasure the concentration on Nanodrop.\nNote: The expected DNA concentration at this point is 10–50 ng/μL. In this case, we had 42.2 ng/μL.\nPause point: The digested DNA can be stored at −20°C.\nRestriction digestion of the library and plasmid\nTiming: 1.5 day\nThis step explains how to perform the restriction digestion and subsequent clean-up of the plasmid and the library pool.\nCRUCIAL: Make sure to check the conditions of the enzymes of choice.\nDigest the plasmid and treat with phosphatase to prevent plasmid self-ligation:\nNote: Digest 2 μg of a ∼4000 nt plasmid. Use more DNA of larger plasmid (e.g. 4 μg for 8000 nt), aiming for ∼0.6–0.7 pmol plasmid.\nPrepare the following mixture (for each sample):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1358_4.csv\nDigest for 2 h at appropriate temperature (e.g., 37°C). We recommend using a PCR machine for the restriction digestion steps, as it has a more stable temperature then heat blocks or water baths.\nAdd to the reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1358_5.csv\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nHeat inactivate at 65°C for 20 min.",
    "Run 5 μL of the cut product and 200 ng of undigested plasmid on an agarose e-gel to check if the plasmid is cut well. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A for a scheme of the expected gel pattern of the uncut, single cut, and double cut vectors. If the digestion was inefficient, refer to Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1358-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Restriction digestion and electroelution\n(A) Schematic of plasmid digestion. RE = restriction enzyme. The digested bands run faster than the circular plasmid. There is no significant difference in the pattern of the single and double digestions. B: Oligo pool digested with SpeI and BstBI. Cut library has a size of 123 nt.\n(C) Electroelution set up. The first 60 min forward current is used, followed by 3 min reverse current. The transparent arrows on the tubes are marked in blue for better visibility.\nPurify the digested plasmid on QIAGEN QIAQuick PCR purification columns, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (same as above).\nElute in 30 μL Dnase free water at the final step.\nNote: The expected DNA concentration at this point is ∼50 ng/μL (∼70% recovery). Here, we obtained 54.8 ng/μL.\nDigest the oligo pool with appropriate restriction enzymes (same as the ones used for digesting the plasmid):\nDilute the DNA to 10 ng/μL.\nThree parallel reactions were set up to increase the efficiency of restriction enzyme digestion and allow the digestion of a high amount of DNA. Prepare a pool for 3 reactions based on the following (per tube):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1358_6.csv\nDigest for 2 h at the temperature required by the enzymes of choice.",
    "Note: In this example, we used the restriction enzymes SpeI and BstBI. As they work at different temperatures, we performed the restriction in two steps, first with SpeI at 37°C, then with BstBI at 65°C, for 2 hours each. SpeI was added at time point 0, BstBI was added two hours later. Make sure to check the conditions of the enzymes of choice.\nHeat inactivation according to the requirements of the selected restriction enzymes. Here, we used 20 min of heat inactivation at 80°C.\nPause point: The digested DNA can be stored at −20°C.\nGel cleanup of the cut fragments:\nPrepare a long (min 10 cm) 2% agarose gel with GelStar dye (1:10000) from Lonza.\nNote: GelStar is more sensitive than EtBr, hence allows the use of smaller amounts to avoid having any remains of the dye in the sample after cleanup. The gel should be long to allow a very good separation of small bands.\nMix the samples (120 μL) with 28 μL glycerol (30%) and 2 μL Qiagen 5× loading dye.\nNote: We want to use as little of the loading buffer as possible, to avoid residual dye in the DNA sample. The additional transparent glycerol ensures that the sample sinks to the bottom of the well after loading.\nLoad the gel.\nNote: In case of having multiple pools or subsets, leave a blank well in between any two samples to avoid cross-contamination.\nRun the gel at constant 125 V in 1× TAE buffer for at least 60 min or until full separation of bands (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). If the library digestion is insufficient, see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCut the band from the gel under a UV lamp (302 and 365 nm) and place it into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Note: Due to the low amount of dye, the bands may be dim and hard to see. Increase UV strength if the bands are not visible, or cut according to the expected band size.\nNote: Do not expose the gel to the UV more than necessary to avoid DNA damage. Only turn on the UV light for excising the band, and perform the cutting as quickly as possible.\nExtract the gel fragments using electroelution with the GeBAflex Midi electroelution tubes:\nNote: Cleanup with chaotropic salt containing gel extraction kits can potentially create sequence biases (Guo and Zhang 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Han et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Levo et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), while the electroelution should allow high yield and shouldn’t be affected by the nucleotide composition.\nIf using an electroelution apparatus is not an option, it is possible to use a chemical elution kit, although some bias may be expected.\nPrepare fresh 1× TAE buffer. Wash a small gel tank with water and fill it with TAE.\nFill the GeBAflex tube with 800 μL dH2O and incubate at RT for 5 min.\nCritical: Check carefully that no water is leaking from the tube. Leakage may lead to loss of the entire sample.\nCarefully remove all the water by shaking or pipetting.\nInsert the gel slice into the tube by flipping the microcentrifuge tube onto the GeBAflex tube.\nCritical: The maximum size of gel slice per GeBAflex tube is 1 cm ∗ 0.5 cm. Don’t fill the tube with several gel slices, for large gel slices use more than one tube.\nAdd 700 μL dH20 and close the tube carefully to avoid bubbles. For larger gel slices use smaller amounts of water.\nPlace the GeBAflex tubes directly (without gel casting tray) into a small gel tank (e.g., Owl EasyCast Mini Gel Electrophoresis system or similar).",
    "Critical: The arrow on the plug of the tube is pointed upwards (to ensure that the current flows through the membrane, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: The GeBAflex tubes with the tray need to be fully immersed in TAE. The two membranes of the GeBAflex-tube must be in parallel to the electric field to permit the electric current to pass through the tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nElute DNA for 1 h at constant 125 V, and then for an additional 3 min with reverse current (Bio-Rad PowerPac Basic Power or similar). The short reverse current step detaches the DNA from the dialysis tubing.\nNote: The time and voltage parameters should be calibrated for each band size, gel percentage and for the thickness of the gel slice, according to the manufacturer’s recommendation: https://www.geba.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GeBAflex-Tube-Electroelution-handbook-Protein-DNA-and-RNA-Extraction.pdf[href=https://www.geba.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GeBAflex-Tube-Electroelution-handbook-Protein-DNA-and-RNA-Extraction.pdf].\nNote: For reverse current, plug the + (red) electrode into the black socket, and the – (black) electrode in the red one. Change back the set up after the DNA elution to avoid the next user accidentally losing their sample.\nOpen the tube carefully to avoid losing any of the liquid.\nPipette the solution up and down 5 times and transfer it into a clean 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tube for 1 min at maximum speed.\nTransfer the solution into a clean 1.5 mL tube. Discard the pellet.\nMeasure and record the volume of the liquid with micropipette.\nEthanol precipitation of the DNA\nTo each volume × of the liquid, add 0.1× volume of 3M NaOAc, 0.005× of glycogen and of 1× isopropanol. In this example, we added 640 μL of isopropanol, 64 μL of NaOAc and 3.2 μL of glycogen to 640 μL of eluate.\nInvert the tube a few times to mix thoroughly.\nIncubate the sample in −20°C for at least 12 h to ensure sufficient DNA precipitation.",
    "Prepare 70% ethanol for the next day and store in −20°C.\nContinue the next day:\nCool a microcentrifuge to 4°C (Thermo Fisher MicroCL 17R Microcentrifuge or similar).\nCentrifuge the sample in a cold centrifuge for 5 min at maximum speed.\nRemove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet using a micropipette.\nAdd 1 mL ethanol (pre-chilled at −20°C) 70% ethanol, centrifuge for 5 min, remove liquid.\nAir dry pellet on ice in a chemical hood for 5 min with open tube cap.\nRepeat the washing step (i & j), including the 5 min drying step 2 more times.\nNote: The washing steps are required in order to get rid of the salts that will damage the ligation reaction.\nDry the pellet in a chemical hood, on ice for about 20 min. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for potential solutions if no pellet is visible at this point.\nResuspend the pellet in 13 μL DNase free water. Combine pellets of the same sample into the same tube with this volume (in case the electroelution was done in multiple tubes).\nMeasure the concentration with Qubit: https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf].\nNote: The concentration should be ∼1 ng/μL. Here, we had 1.3 ng/μL.\nLigation and transformation\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes the ligation reaction of the pool into the plasmid, followed by clean up and the transformation of electrocompetent bacteria. The transformation is followed by plating the cells on large agar plates for 8–16 h incubation, as well as serial dilutions to estimate the library complexity.\nPreparations:\nDry the agar plates in a 37°C incubator, for 1–2 h, placing the plate slightly tilted over its lid to dry. In case significant amount of water is present in the plates due to condensed humidity, carefully tap the plates over absorbent paper to dry them before placing in the incubator.",
    "Take out the recovery medium (supplied with the bacteria) from −80°C to thaw.\nLigation:\nPrepare ligation mix in a PCR tube. For an example of 123 nt insert and 4213 nt plasmid:\nNote: We are using 150 ng of plasmid DNA, and calculate the amount of insert according to a 1:1 plasmid:insert molar ratio. This minimizes the amount of multiple insertions while maximizing ligation efficiency. With this ratio, we get about 2% of the transformants with multiple inserts.\nNote: Calculate the required amount (ng) of insert as follows: 150/(size of plasmid/size of insert).\nNote: For libraries with many variants, we recommend the preparation of two ligation reactions, according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1358_7.csv\nLet it stand at 18°C–25°C for 30 min.\nHeat inactivate the ligase at 70°C for 15 min.\nPut ligation on ice for 2 min and proceed directly to clean up.\nMerge the ligations together if you use multiple reactions.\nClean-up of ligation: clean ligation product on Zymo DNA Clean up and Concentration columns according to the manufacturer's instructions: https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_D4003T_D4003_D4004_D4013_D4014_DNA_Clean_Concentrator_-5_ver_1_2_1_LKN-SW__1.pdf[href=https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_D4003T_D4003_D4004_D4013_D4014_DNA_Clean_Concentrator_-5_ver_1_2_1_LKN-SW__1.pdf]. Alternative kits that allow elution in a 15 μL volume can be used as well.\nNote: 2 μL ligation product is used for each transformation cuvette. Total elution volume should be adjusted to the number of electroporation cuvettes. Here, we used a total 15 μL for 7 cuvettes. (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nElute in 7.5 μL water.\nRepeat the elution step on top with another, fresh 7.5 μL of water. The total volume will be 15 μL.\nNote: Cleaning the ligation product radically increases transformation efficiency. In case multiple ligation reactions were used, it’s necessary to concentrate the ligation product. Keep the total elution volume at 15 μL even for multiple ligation reactions to get a concentrated product.\nKeep the ligation product on ice throughout the next steps.",
    "Proceed directly with the transformation.\nTransformation of E. cloni cells:\nCritical: For adequate transformation efficiency, all reagents should be kept cold. The electroporation is performed in a cold room (4°C).\nMove pipettes and tips into the cold room at least 30 min before use to cool down. Carry the electroporator to the cold room as well.\nNote: The number of electroporation reactions per sample should increase with library size (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1])\nPlace an adequate number of electroporation cuvettes (0.1 cm gap) and the same number of 1.5 mL tubes on ice.\nDivide 975 μL of the recovery medium to the same number of 15 mL tubes for the recovery.\nThaw on ice an ampule of E. cloni cells.\nNote: One vial of E. cloni cells is sufficient for 7 electroporation cuvettes (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nCritical: The cells are very sensitive. Do not warm or vortex. For additional notes on handling the bacteria, see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDivide 23 μL of bacteria to each pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 2 μL of the ligation mixture to each tube.\nStir briefly with a pipette tip.\nCritical: Don’t pipette up and down to mix. This could introduce air bubbles and warm the cells.\nCarefully pipette the entire mix into the pre-chilled cuvettes. Avoid generating air bubbles.\nElectroporate the cells with BioRad Micropulser electroporator using the EcI program (1.8 kV pulse). For the detailed set up of the electroporator, see the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section. If the time constant is low, or the machine shows arc error, see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: The time constant should be over 4 ms. In this experiment, we had time constants in the range of 5.7–5.9 ms. For further notes on the time constant, see the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section, or troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "As quickly as possible, add the recovery medium to the cuvette. Pipette three times to resuspend the cells and put it back to the 15 mL tube.\nTransfer the tubes in a shaking, 37°C incubator for a 1 h recovery.\nMerge together all the reactions into a 15 mL tube.\nNote: We prepare 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions and spread it on the 9 cm agar plates, to estimate the total number of colonies and to pick colonies for colony PCR.\nTake out 20 μL and dilute 1:10 with SOC medium. From the 1:10 dilution, dilute 20 μL 1:10, to obtain a 1:100 dilution. Seed 50 μL of both dilution to a small agar plate. (These will be used for colony counting and colony PCR the next day.)\nSpread the remaining bacteria on the calculated number of large agar plates (∼240 μL/plate). Light a Bunsen burner and place on the working station to ensure a sterile environment. Pipette ∼240 μL on a plate and spread it with a bacterial cell spreader, plating beads, or any preferred method. Repeat until the entire liquid volume is used.\nIncubate the plates upside-down for 8–16 h at 37°C.\nNote: We prepare the DNA directly from large agar plates instead of using a liquid medium. This allows independent growth of every colony, while in liquid medium the bacteria are competing for resources, which could lead to depletion of certain sequences, if the fitness of bacteria transformed with every construct isn’t equal.\nColony PCR and plasmid preparation\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step explains how to calculate the number of colonies per construct, analyze the library quality and prepare the DNA for subsequent transfection.\nEstimate the number of colonies per construct:\nCount the colonies on the dilution plates.\nCalculate the number of colonies per construct.",
    "Note: Multiply the number of colonies on the 1:100 dilution by 480 (if seeding 240 μL per plate) to get the number of colonies on a large (14 cm) plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nIn this example (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A), we used a 1:10 and 1:50 dilution. While counting and colony picking was possible, for better accuracy and easier handling we recommend 1:10 and 1:100 dilution in this protocol. As we had some additional plates and used a total of 28 plates, the seeded volume per plate in this example is 200 μL.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1358-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Counting and quality control of the colonies\n(A) Colonies on the 1:50 dilution plate. Approximately 400 colonies in ⅛ of the plate means 3200 colonies on the dilution plate, and ∼18.5 million colonies in total.\n(B) Colony PCR of 28 picked colonies. EV is the empty vector control, showing a 154 nt band. For colony #20, the picking or PCR failed (we don’t see the band for the empty vector either). Colony #25 was likely transformed with two plasmid, one with a single insertion, and one with a double insertion. The remaining 26 colonies have correct single integration of 277 nt.\n(C) Possible scenarios of band patterns in colony PCR. 1: Empty vector, also used as negative control. 2: Colony with proper single integration. 3: Colony with double integration. 4: Colony that likely received two plasmids, one with a single integration, and one with a double integration. 5: Colony that likely received two plasmids, one with a single integration, and one with an empty vector that closed on itself. 6: Colony picking or PCR failed, no band.",
    "In this example, we had ∼400 colonies in ⅛ of a 1:50 dilution plate. On the entire 1:50 dilution plate, we had 400∗8 =3200 colonies. On a single 14 cm plate, that gives 3200∗200=640000 colonies, and on the total 29 plates, approximately 18.5 million colonies. 18.5 million colonies for the 12000 constructs gives ∼1500 colonies per construct. If the number of colonies is too low, see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nMaxi prep of library DNA\nScrape the bacteria off all plates with a cell lifter into an adequate sized bottle, to mix all the bacteria together.\nDivide the bacteria into 50 mL tubes.\nTake out 10% of the bacteria into a separate tube for freezing glycerol stocks.\nCentrifuge the bacteria both for the maxi prep and for the glycerol stock at 5,000×g for 15 min in 4°C (Heraeus Megafuge 16R or similar).\nFor the glycerol stocks, resuspend the bacteria in 6 mL LB. Aliquot 1.2 mL of the bacteria into each of 5 freezing tubes, and to each add 0.4 mL 80% glycerol. Vortex and transfer to a cryotube.\nPut directly to −80°C.\nFreeze bacterial pellets for the maxi prep at −20°C.\nPause point: Bacteria pellet for the maxi prep can be stored at −20°C for a few days.\nColony PCR\nPrepare PCR mix for about 30 colonies. Reagents per sample:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1358_8.csv\nDivide the mix into PCR strips.\nWith a clean pipette tip, pick a colony from the 9 cm agar plate (with the appropriate dilution for single colony picking) and place the pipette into a cell in the PCR strip.\nContinue until all wells have a tip.\nRemove tips.\nRun the PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1358_9.csv",
    "Run samples on a 1% ethidium bromide agarose gel. If the insert size is less than 50 nucleotides, use a 2% agarose gel instead of the 1%, to enable the detection of double integrations appearing as a double band of similar sizes.\nAnalyze the ratio of good colonies to empty vectors or multiple insertions. Colonies with no insertion have the same band size as the empty vector control. Colonies with multiple insertions have larger band size. See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C for a schematic depicting the most likely integration patterns and representative gel patterns. If you have a high ratio of colonies with no insertions, or multiple insertions, see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPerform DNA maxi prep according to the manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.takarabio.com/resourcedocument/x32861[href=https://www.takarabio.com/resourcedocument/x32861]. In this example, the yield of the maxi prep was ∼ 600 μg DNA."
