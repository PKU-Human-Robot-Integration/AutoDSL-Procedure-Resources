    "The genes encoding for the three AT or complement peptide receptors are organized in a similar way, with a 5′-untranslated region (UTR), two exons, and a 3′-UTR after exon 2 (https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=5)[href=https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=5)]. This offers the opportunity to insert a fluorescent reporter sequence (tdTomato or GFP) before or at the beginning of exon 2. With the inserted construct, one locus of cross-over P1 (loxP) site is introduced at the 5′ end of the reporter sequence and another one after the coding region of the receptor before the 3′-UTR. According to the general design, the C5aR1 construct includes a GFP coding sequence ending with a stop codon, followed by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) placed upstream of exon 2 encoding for the C5ar1 gene, which is flanked by loxP sites at both ends. Between the loxP site at the 5′-UTR and the GFP reporter gene, a neomycin cassette with flippase recognition target (FRT) sites at both ends was included. During the generation of mice, the neomycin cassette was removed by breeding to a flippase (FLP) deleter mouse strain (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b9a5fb81-b745-4e11-8f40-b2e1adf7d177/cpim100-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Gene targeting strategy to generate floxed GFP-C5aR1 knockin mice and to excise the C5ar1 mutant locus by Cre-mediated deletion. (A) Genomic locus of the C5ar1 gene on chromosome 7 with two exons. (B) Targeting vector comprising an AcGFP-IRES cassette directly upstream of the 5′ end of exon 2 of the C5ar1 gene. Further, the neomycin marker gene was introduced at the 5′ end of the AcGFP cassette flanked by two FRT sites. Finally, two loxP sites were introduced; one at the 5′-end of the neomycin cassette next to the FRT site and another one downstream of exon 2 of the C5ar1 gene directly after the stop codon. (C) Floxed GFP-C5ar1 mutant locus after homologous recombination. Breeding of floxed GFP-C5ar1 mutant mice to flp deleter mice resulted in flp recombinase-mediated neomycin gene removal. (D) Crossing floxed GFP-C5aR1 knockin mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase results in the excision of the C5ar1 mutant locus at the loxP target sequence. FRT, recognition sequence for flp recombinase-mediated neomycin gene removal; loxP, recognition sequence for Cre recombinase–mediated exon deletion; neo: neomycin gene cassette for selection in ES cells.\nTo determine the genotype of the AT receptor reporter mice, we have set up a PCR-based approach in which we detect the presence of the reporter sequence (GFP: PCR1) including the loxP sites and/or the AT receptor wild-type genes (C5ar1: PCR 2), in particular in the case of target cell−specific AT receptor deletion after breeding of the AT receptor reporter mice to defined Cre mice (H.

    "1. Prepare PCR1 primer mix by combining 20 µl each of primers AH7/AH9/GK91/GK92 (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-tbl-0001]) from primer stock (100 µM) in a 1.5-ml screw-cap microcentrifuge tube with O-ring, and make up with 120 µl nuclease-free water to a final volume of 200 µl. Store at −20°C.\n2. Prepare PCR2 primer mix by combining 20 µl each of primers AH7/AH8/AH15/AH16 (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-tbl-0001]) from primer stock (100 µM) in a 1.5-ml screw-cap microcentrifuge tube with O-ring, and make up with 120 µl nuclease-free water to a final volume of 200 µl. Store at −20°C.\nThe final concentration of the primer mix for PCR1 and PCR2 is 10 µM for each primer\n3. Prepare separate master mixes for PCR1 and PCR2 by pipetting the following reagents at the indicated volumes into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube (per sample):\n         \n6.25 µl nuclease-free water\n1.25 µl primer mix for PCR1 (step 1) or PCR2 (step 2)\n12.5 µl 2× KAPA2G Fast Hot Start Genotyping Mix\nMix and microcentrifuge briefly to bring mixture to bottom of tube.\nThe final concentration of each primer in PCR1 and 2 is 0.5 µM after adding the template.\n4. Combine 5 µl template [genomic DNA (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-prot-0004]) from floxed GFP-C5aR1 knockin mouse diluted 1:10 with nuclease-free water] or nuclease-free water for control with 20 µl of the appropriate master mix in a 0.2-ml 8-tube PCR strip without caps, and run the following thermocycling conditions for both PCR1 and PCR2 after closing the tubes with the 8-capstrips for PCR tubes:\n         \ntable:\n﻿Step no.,Temp.,Time,No. of cycles\n1,95°C,180 s,1 cycle\n2,95°C,15 s,\n3,62°C,15 s,\n4,72°C,60 s,\n5,\"As in 2, 3, and 4\",\"As in 2, 3, and 4\",35 cycles (total)\n6,72°C,120 s,1 cycle\n7,15°C,Hold,",
    "The thermocycler protocol always follows the same layout: in an initial step, the protecting protein of the hot-start Taq polymerase is irreversibly denatured at 95°C (No.1). Then, a defined number of three-step cycles comprising DNA denaturation (No.2), primer annealing (No.3), and elongation (No.4) are carried out (here, for 35 cycles). After final elongation of unfinished sequences (step 6), samples are incubated indefinitely at 15°C (No.7).\nThese conditions apply to the BioRad C1000 Thermal Cycler or C1000Touch. Temperatures need to be established for other thermocycler models. It is desirable to use a PCR workstation (e.g., Analytic Jena) to avoid cross contamination and a PCR cooler (e.g., Eppendorf AG) to secure the template quality.\n5. Prepare a 1.5% SB agarose gel as described in Brody & Kern (2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0003]).\nAlso see Current Protocols article: Voytas (2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0043]).\n6. Run samples on 1.5% SB agarose gel using the following conditions: 30-40 min, 200 V, with a 7-cm running length. Include DNA markers. Load per lane: either 6 µl PCR reaction or 4 µl marker.\nThe selected markers (O'Gene Ruler DNA Ladder Mix) use the TriTrack DNA Loading Dye, which allows for three-color tracking of DNA migration. On a 1% agarose gel, bromophenol blue matches ∼300-bp DNA, while xylene cyanol FF matches ∼4000-bp DNA. Orange G matches small DNA fragments (∼50 bp). Even though the electrophoresis running time at this high voltage is quite short, the band resolution of the gel is excellent when using sodium borate buffer instead of TAE buffer. Because of the low ionic strength of the buffer, no additional cooling of the gel is needed.\n7. Stain the gel with GelRed working solution for 45 min in a tray.",
    "Tilting on a conventional rocking platform with ±7.5° at about 15 rpm will ensure uniform staining results. No destaining step is necessary. GelRed is non-mutagenic and safer for the environment than ethidium bromide.\n8. Visualize the gel bands with UV light and document the result by photography.\nTypical results showing the amplicons from genotyping of wild-type, GFP-C5aR1fl/+, and GFP-C5aR1fl/fl mice are shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0002].

    "Breeding of the floxed GFP-C5aR1 knockin mice with strains that harbor a Cre recombinase will result in the targeted deletion of the GFP-C5aR1 cassette through excision at the two loxP sites (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0001]). Similarly, the tdTomato-C3ar1 or C5ar2 genes will be excised in response to Cre (Figs. 4D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0004] and 5D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0005]). Here, we describe the genotyping of LysMcre-C5aR1 in which LysMcre mice (Clausen, Burkhardt, Reith, Renkawitz, & Forster, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0005]) have been crossed with floxed GFP-C5aR1 knockin mice to specifically delete C5aR1 in granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages (Karsten et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0022]). Given that the C5ar1 gene is still expressed in many cell types, we have set up an analysis system that includes C5ar1 (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-prot-0001]) and Lyz2, the gene encoding for lysozyme M(lysM). The C5ar1 and Lyz2 genes are expressed on two different chromosomes, i.e., chromosomes 7 and 10. To delete C5aR1 in lysM-expressing cells, GFP-C5aR1fl/fl mice need to harbor at least one functional Cre allele under the control of the lysM promoter.\nMaterials\n100 µM primers for PCR3 (Eurofins Genomics or Life Technologies GmbH)\nNuclease-free water (Life Technologies GmbH, cat. no.

    "In addition to C5aR1, we have targeted the C3ar1 and C5ar2 genes to generate reporter mice that allow tracking of cellular C3aR and C5aR2 expression and cell-specific deletion. To provide a strong signal with a high stability, in particular upon standard fixation procedures, we used a tandem-dye (td)Tomato instead of GFP (de Felipe et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0011]). Furthermore, although IRES is a widely used design to produce independent proteins from one mRNA, we and others have found that the translation of the coding sequence under the control of IRES is less efficient than the translation of the main ribosomal entry sequence (de Felipe et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0011]; Karsten et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0022]). As an alternative approach, we have used the short, self-cleaving peptide derived from porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A; Kim et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0025]), which shows high cleavage efficiency and a stoichiometric expression of proteins flanking the 2A peptide (de Felipe et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0011]; Kim et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0025]). In the case of the C3ar1 gene, the resulting targeting construct encoded a 6.2-kb 5′ homology arm and a 3.0-kb 3′ homology arm flanking the floxed coding region of exon 2, in which tdTomato_P2A has been inserted in frame with the ATG of exon 2 (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0004]). Similarly, we have inserted the tdTomato sequence following the splice acceptor of exon 2 in-frame with the coding sequence of the C5ar2 gene (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0005]). In both cases, two loxP sites flank the constructs for potential excision of the C3ar1 or C5ar2 genes by Cre-mediated deletion.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a2f7a62-52b1-482d-acd8-43d2a973e9f4/cpim100-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

    "Floxed AT receptor reporter mice allow the assessment of AT receptor expression without the need for labeled ligands or antibodies. The GFP and tdTomato reporter genes that are under the control of the promoters of the C5ar1, C5ar2, or C3ar1 genes encode for strongly fluorescent proteins that can easily be detected by imaging technologies, including flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. As an example, we describe here a protocol to monitor the expression of tdTomato as a surrogate for C3aR expression in peritoneal macrophages. The same procedure can be used to delineate the expression of GFP as a surrogate for C5aR1 and tdTomato as a surrogate for C5aR2 expression, since peritoneal macrophages are known to strongly express all AT receptors (Karsten et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0022]; Karsten et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0023]; Quell et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0034]). Importantly, the genetic association of a reporter gene to AT receptor genes can impact the trafficking of the AT receptors to the cell surface (Dunkelberger, Zhou, Miwa, & Song, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0015]). Thus, it is important to also assess the surface expression of ATRs in GFP-C5aR1+, tdTomato-C5aR2+, or tdTomato-C3aR+ cells using AT-receptor-specific antibodies, and control for the specificity using the respective AT receptor−deficient mice.

    "The expression of the GFP or tdTomato AT receptor surrogate fluorochrome is not necessarily linked with surface or intracellular expression of the AT receptors. Although our previous results show a strong match of C5aR1 and C3aR surface expression with the GFP or tdTomato signal (Karsten et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0022]; Quell et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0034]), we strongly recommend also staining the GFP-C5aR1+, tdTomato-C3aR+, or tdTomato-C5aR2+ cells with AT receptor−specific antibodies to verify AT receptor surface expression. In the case of tdTomato-C5aR2+ cells, we have not yet been able to verify the surface expression with C5aR2-specific antibodies, as all antibodies that we have tested so far have also showed surface staining in C5aR2-deficient mice, suggesting cross-reactivity with other structures (Karsten et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0023]). We strongly recommend using AT receptor−deficient mice to control for the specificity of a given AT receptor antibody and not to rely only on FMO or IgG isotype controls.

    "C5aR1 is a G protein−coupled receptor (GPCR) that couples preferentially to pertussis toxin (PT)−sensitive G protein Gai2 or Gai3, but can also bind to the PT-insensitive G proteins Ga15 and Ga16 (Klos, Wende, Wareham, & Monk, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0026]). Engagement of C5aR1 by its natural ligands C5a and C5a-desArg results in a series of signaling events that involve the activation of PI3K, Akt, and MAPK signaling, resulting in the phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK 1/2, in particular in bone marrow−derived neutrophils. Thus, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 can be used to assess the C5aR1 function in GFP-C5aR1+ cells. As an example, this protocol describes the analysis of C5a-driven ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GFP-C5aR1+ bone marrow−derived neutrophils.\nMaterials\nFloxed GFP-C5aR1 knockin mice (Köhl laboratory)\nDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, no calcium, no magnesium (D-PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 14190144)\nRecombinant human (rh) C5a, (Hycult Biotech, cat. no.

Process and analyze images using the data analysis software of your microscope.\nFigure 11B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0011] shows the microscopic evaluation of the C3a-mediated change of [Ca2+]i in thioglycolate-elicited PMs from wild-type and tdTomato-C3ar1fl/fl mice.",
    "C5aR2 expression frequently overlaps with C5aR1 expression, making it difficult to differentiate between C5aR1 and C5aR2 effects in response to C5a stimulation. One solution to this problem is to use the recently described specific C5aR2 agonist P32 (Croker et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0008]). Another option is to use cell types that exclusively express C5aR2. Using floxed tdTomato-C5aR2 knockin mice, we uncovered that some naïve NK cells from spleen and blood show this property and express C5aR2 but not C5aR1 (Karsten et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0023]). Also, naïve B cells from blood and spleen express C5aR2 but not C5aR1. Thus, NK cells are a perfect tool to study the function of C5aR2 independently of C5aR1. NK cells are innate immune cells that exert different effector functions. In addition to their cytotoxic effects critical for killing of tumor cells, they can produce a wide array of cytokines that play important roles in viral infections and the regulation of adaptive immune responses including IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-22 (see Current Protocols article: Zamora, Grossenbacher, Aguilar, & Murphy, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0045]). In Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-prot-0011], we therefore describe C5aR2-driven suppression of IL-12/IL-18-induced IFN-γ production using P32 as an example of C5aR2-mediated function in NK cells.\nMaterials\nFloxed tdTomato-C5aR2 knockin mice (Köhl laboratory)\nSplenic NK cells (see Support Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-prot-0012])\nComplete RPMI medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-rec-0001])\nIL-12p70 (Peprotech, cat. no. 210-12)\nIL-18 (BioLegend, cat. no. 767002)\nDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, no calcium, no magnesium (D-PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 14190144)\nC5aR2-specific agonist P32 (T.

Isolate splenic NK cells as described in Support Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-prot-0012].\nWhile one mouse of each strain is sufficient to harvest enough splenic cells to determine the IFN-γ production, at least three to five animals should be used to validate the data.\n3. Count cells (see Current Protocols article: Strober (2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0040]).

Add 2 µl each of the IL-12 and IL-18 working solution (10 ng/ml each final concentration) or D-PBS (as control) to the cells.\nThis step will stimulate the NK cells to produce IFN-γ. Make duplicates or triplicates for each condition to minimize variation.\n7. Add 4 μl of the specific C5aR2 agonist P32 at 5 mM for a 100 µM final concentration, or an equal amount of D-PBS (as control) to the cells.",
    "This step will test the impact of C5aR2 activation on the IL-12/IL-18-induced IFN-γ production. Alternatively, you can add 2.88 µl of rhC5a (0.87 µM; 12.5 nM final concentration) instead of the specific C5aR2 agonist, as NK cells express only C5aR2 but not C5aR1. Make duplicates or triplicates for each condition to minimize variation.\n8. Incubate cells for 24 hr in a CO2 incubator at 37°C (5% CO2).\n9. Collect the supernatant and measure IFN-γ concentration using a Duo-Set IFN-γ ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nFigure 12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0012] shows the impact of C5aR2 activation on IL-12/IL-18-induced IFN-γ production from splenic NK cells.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/061cae05-9bec-4c8c-9d4b-9a3bd5a71cd8/cpim100-fig-0012-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 12\nC5aR2 controls IL12-/IL-18-induced IFN-γ production from NK cells: (A) IFN-γ production from sorted splenic NK cells of wild-type and C5ar2−/− mice 24 hr after stimulation with IL-12/IL-18.

    "Several methods have been published to isolate NK cells from spleen, some of which use selected mAbs to deplete contaminating cells such as T, B, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and monocytes by magnetic separation (see Current Protocols article: Pak-Wittel, Piersma, Plougastel, Poursine-Laurent, & Yokoyama, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0033]). The advantage of magnetic isolation is that it is fast, easy to carry out, and cost-effective, and still results in a purity of up to 95%.

    "We regularly use 8- to 12-week-old mice of both sexes.\n2. Remove the spleen (see Current Protocols article: Reeves et al., 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0035]), transfer it into a 1.5-ml tube filled with ice-cold D-PBS, and store it on ice.\n3. Pass the cells through a nylon cell strainer (40-µm pore size) into a 50-ml tube using a syringe plunger to obtain a single-cell suspension.\n4. Add 15 ml of D-PBS to wash the cells and centrifuge 5 min at 400 × g, 4°C.\n5. Add 3 ml of RBCL and incubate for 3 min at room temperature.\n6. Add 37 ml of D-PBS and centrifuge cells 5 min at 400 × g, 4°C.\nThis will stop the lysis of red blood cells.\n7. Resuspend pellet in 30 ml D-PBS.\n8. Prepare a 10-µl aliquot to count the cell number.\nWe routinely use a Neubauer chamber (hemocytometer; see Current Protocols article: Strober, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-bib-0040]).\n9. Centrifuge the cells 5 min at 400 × g, 4°C.\n10. Adjust the cell number to 1 × 108 cells/ml with D-PBS.\nExample: 6.5 × 107 cells were counted from the pellet resuspended in a total volume of 30 ml D-PBS using the Neubauer chamber. To obtain 1 × 108 cells/ml, cells are centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g, 4°C, and resuspended in 650 µl D-PBS.\n11. Add 3.33 µl of anti-CD16/CD32 antibody per ml of cells and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nThis treatment blocks unspecific binding of the antibodies to IgG Fc receptors. No Fc block buffer is used in this protocol because the Fc block is prepared in D-PBS/BSA; however, Live/Dead staining has to be done in D-PBS without BSA.\n12. Prepare Live/Dead staining working solution (50 µM) by adding 10 µl Live/Dead stain from the kit to 10 µl D-PBS",
    "Use Live/Dead reagent at room temperature because this will allow the dye to permeate the damaged membranes of dead cells more efficiently due to increased Brownian motion, compared to incubation at 4°C. Once inside the cell, the dye will bind to intracellular amines and its fluorescent properties will be activated.\n13. Add 2 µl of the Live/Dead working solution per ml cell suspension.\n14. Add 2.5 µl of each of the following antibodies per ml of cells:\n         \nCD3e (1.25 µg/ml)\nNKp46 (0.5 µg/ml)\nNK1.1 (1.25 µg/ml).\n15. Incubate cells for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.\n16. Add 0.5 ml of D-PBS and centrifuge cells for 5 min at 400 × g, 4°C.\n17. Resuspend cells in 350 µl D-PBS.\n18. Run the cells on a cell sorter using the gating strategy outlined in Figure 13[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.100#cpim100-fig-0013]\nThe number of splenic NK cells is quite low. About 2% of spleen cells are NK cells. Thus, to obtain a highly pure NK cell population, the gates need to be set very conservatively to avoid contamination with other cells. The typical yield is 5 × 107 total cells/spleen, i.e., 1 × 106 NK cells/spleen.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0928475e-6e0a-4740-8e9b-ee48b171806f/cpim100-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13\nGating strategy to purify NK cells from the spleen by FACS.
