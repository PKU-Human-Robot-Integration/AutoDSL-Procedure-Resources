    "Preparation of GRIN lens and EEG electrodes Cut piano wires to ~5 mm length (Figure 3A and 3B).Position two wires on the side of the GRIN lens, with the help of a small piece of Scotch tape (3 × 5 mm) under the microscope. The wires should be parallel to the lens, with the tips extending 200–300 μm from the GRIN lens (Figure 3C).Add 1–3 μL of Krazy glue to the wires.Wait until the Krazy glue dries.Carefully remove the Scotch tape.Keep finished GRIN lens (Figure 3D) in a container for surgical use.Cut stainless steel wires and silver wires to ~2 cm length.Solder three stainless steel wires and two silver wires to a 5-position connector. The stainless steel wires will be used as EEG electrodes, while the silver wires will be used as EMG electrodes (Figure 3E).Apply epoxy around the soldering area to secure all wires to the connector.Keep finished EEG electrodes (Figure 3E) in a container for surgical use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4664/bioprotoc-13-09-4664-g003.jpgFigure 3.

Attachment of anchoring wires to the GRIN lens. D. Assembled GRIN lens. E. Assembled EEG/EMG electrode, inset: diagram of channel configuration. The middle wire is used as the reference (ref) for EEG.Viral injection Pull the glass capillary into a needle shape with Sutter P-1000 and load ~500 nL of AAV1-FLEX-GCaMP6f virus into the glass pipette of the nano injector.First weigh and then anesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg).Once the mouse is anesthetized, lubricate their eyes with an application of ophthalmic ointment.Mount the animal onto a stereotaxic frame (Figure 4A) and clip the hair in a 1 × 2 cm area encircling the surgical site.",
    "Maintain normothermia by a feedback-controlled thermostatic heating pad.Disinfect the skin by swabbing three times with povidone iodine alternated with 70% alcohol, followed by a final application of povidone iodine. Then, remove the skin on the dorsal aspect of the head.Level the antero-posterior (A-P) and left-right (L-R) axis of the skull.Drill a hole of 1 mm diameter into the skull above the target coordinate (VLM, bregma -6.9 mm, lateral 1.1 mm, ventral 5.6 mm, the ventral coordinate is relative to the pial surface).Position the nano injector to the target coordinate (Figure 4B) and lower the injector slowly until its tip reaches the depth of 5.6 mm below the dorsal surface of the brain (Figure 4C). Use a low speed to minimize the damage to the surrounding brain tissues.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4664/bioprotoc-13-09-4664-g004.jpgFigure 4. Stereotaxic viral injection. A. Equipment for viral injection. B. Positioning the nano injector to the target brain region. C. Inserting the glass capillary into the drilled brain region.Inject 200 nL of virus at a rate of 50 nL/min.Wait 5 min to allow the spread of the virus.Lift the injector slowly until the tip is out of the brain.GRIN lens implantation We used a custom-made stainless steel metal pin (400 μm in diameter, 20 mm in length, tip polished into a sharp edge) to create a path for facilitating the implantation of the GRIN lens, by inserting the metal pin 400 μm above the injection site and retracting it 2 min after the insertion (Figure 5A).Attach the GRIN lens to an Inscopix holder through the provided adapter (Figure 5B). Attach the holder on the micromanipulator.Slowly insert the GRIN lens at the speed of 10 μm/s into the brain path created by the metal pin, until it reaches 200 μm above the target coordinate (Figure 5C).",
    "Fix the GRIN lens onto the skull with the dental cement surrounding the lens (Figure 5D). Note that only the necessary amount of dental cement should be applied, to ensure most of the skull is still exposed for the following procedure. A minimum of 20 min is recommended to make sure the dental cement dried completely for the strong stabilization of the mount.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4664/bioprotoc-13-09-4664-g005.jpgFigure 5.

Secure the GRIN lens with black dental cement.EEG/EMG electrodes implantation Trim stainless steel and silver wires if needed. Remove the plastic insulation at the end of the wires with ~0.3 mm length.Drill (drill size: 0.5 mm diameter) three holes into the skull: two holes for EEG recording on top of the cortex (EEG1: 1 mm from midline, 1.5 mm anterior to the bregma; EEG2: 1 mm from midline, 1.5 mm posterior to the bregma). The third hole, for reference, should be on top of the cerebellum.Position the electrodes on top of the brain using a holder.Insert the EEG stainless wires into the holes and then secure them with bone screws. Use a screwdriver to make 2.5–3 turns for epidural position over the cortex (Figure 6A).Insert two EMG electrodes bilaterally into the neck musculature (Figure 6A).Cover the skull and implanted GRIN lens and EEG/EMG electrodes with black dental cement.Attach a metal headpost with dental cement.Cover the top of the Proview GRIN lens with silicon adhesive (Figure 6B and 6C).Keep the mouse on the heat pad until recovery.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4664/bioprotoc-13-09-4664-g006.jpgFigure 6.

    "Implants and headpost secured with black cement.Mounting base plate for microendoscopic calcium imaging After 3–4 weeks, fix the awake mouse on a custom-built head-fixation platform.Attach the baseplate to the bottom of the Inscopix miniature microendoscope.Remove the silicon cover on the GRIN lens.Position the microendoscope above the GRIN lens (Figure 7A).Adjust the angle of the head until the focal plane is parallel to the surface of the GRIN lens (Figure 7B).Find the best focal plane of the active cells (Figure 7B) by a) maximizing the number of cells in the field of view, and b) using the DF/F mode to clearly visualize real-time activity.Attach the baseplate to mouse head with dental cement (Figure 7C). Do not move the microendoscope until the dental cement is totally dry.Remove the microendoscope and cover the GRIN lens with baseplate cover (Figure 7D).Return the mouse to its home cage to rest.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4664/bioprotoc-13-09-4664-g007.jpgFigure 7.

EEG implants, baseplate, and baseplate cover secured with black cement.Simultaneous microendoscopic calcium imaging and EEG recording On the day of recording, connect the microendoscope and the EEG cables to the mouse on a head-fixation platform (Figure 8A).Habituate the mouse in the behavioral arena for at least 90 min.Start the imaging acquisition and sleep recording for 1–2 h as follows.Calcium activity is acquired using the nVista 3.0 hardware and IDPS software (Inscopix) with 475 nm LED illumination (10 Hz, 0.4–1.2 mW/mm2). EEG and EMG are recorded, bandpass filtered at 0.",
    "5–500 Hz, and digitized at 1,017 Hz using Neuralynx Digital Lynx 4S controlled by a custom-built MATLAB program via Neuralynx API.A TTL signal delivered from the Inscopix system to the Neuralynx system is used to synchronize the timing between the imaging and EEG/EMG recordings (Figure 8B).Repeat 2–3 imaging sessions to capture both wake and sleep states.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4664/bioprotoc-13-09-4664-g008.jpgFigure 8.
