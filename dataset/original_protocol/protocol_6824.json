    "Although many women in perimenopause have normal or erratically high estradiol plasma concentrations (Santoro et al., 1996), estrogenic therapy is very common in clinical practice. Interestingly, improvement was observed regarding the typical symptoms of this transition period (Schmidt et al., 2000). The study that inspired this protocol (Pestana-Oliveira et al., 2018) had as one of its objectives to understand the possible effects of estradiol in the model of accelerated ovarian failure (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3994/bioprotoc-11-08-3994-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic diagram showing the timeline of the experimental protocol. Female Wistar rats (28 post-natal days) must be daily injected with VCD (160 mg/Kg) or corn oil (O; 1.25 ml/kg of body weigh) for 15 days. Approximately 55 days after the first VCD or O injection, insert implant pellets of 17β-estradiol or O s.c in the dorso-lateral region (Groups O + O; VCD + O; VCD + E). 21 days after oil or estradiol pellets implantation rats must be decapitated in the morning of diestrus.VCD or corn oil injections (Figure 2)Weigh and identify the female rats (28th post-natal day) individually and calculate the volume of VCD or corn oil that each will receive. It is important that this procedure is performed every two days. Then prepare and arrange the environment to give the injections. Cover the table or bench with paper and fill the syringes with the volume of VCD or oil previously calculated.Take one animal and apply the subcutaneous injection on the back near to the neck region. Repeat the same procedure for all animals. Perform the applications slowly as the oil is viscous and the syringe may burst from the needle with pressure. In the case of animals that will receive injections containing VCD, avoid wasting liquid after the injection.After finishing all the injections, return the animals to the specific animal facility.",
    "Repeat the entire procedure for 15 consecutive days. To avoid cutaneous and subcutaneous injuries we strongly suggest that injections be applied to different parts of the animal's body.Note: The contact of the skin and mucous membranes with the VCD should be avoided as much as possible, especially if it is handled by female individuals. Therefore, the use of individual safety equipment such as gloves, masks and glasses is strongly recommended. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3994/bioprotoc-11-08-3994-g002.jpgFigure 2. Schematic diagram showing the preparation of the accelerated ovarian failure model and control groups Estrogen therapySilastic capsules preparation (Figure 3) Extend the silastic tubing on a table or bench, with the aid of a ruler, divide it into 15 mm long pieces. Then cut the pieces. Insert the tip of one end of the silastic into a drop of silicone glue, press the opposite end so that the glue enters into tube. With the aid of hemostatic scissors, clamp the end filled with glue. Repeat this procedure with the remaining pieces of silastic. Place the tubes on a flat surface for 24 h so that the glue can dry and thus seal the tube end (Figure 3-1).Use a pipette and a plastic tip (0.5-10 µl) to fill the silastic capsules with 8 µl of 17-β-estradiol (50 mg/ml, previously diluted in corn oil). The estradiol suspension must be placed on a magnetic stirrer to ensure homogeneity throughout the process of filling the pellets. In addition, on the previous day it is important to subject the solution to ultrasound for 3 h followed by overnight stirring. When ready, it should appear as a homogeneous milky solution. At rest, the suspension settles, and it is possible to observe two phases: the upper one (vehicle) represented by the oil is transparent while the lower one is whitish.",
    "The oil pellets must be filled with 8 µl of corn oil. The sealing process of the open end of the capsules is the same as described above except that it requires greater care considering that the capsules are filled with liquid. After complete sealing, it is important to trim the ends using small scissors (Figure 3-2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3994/bioprotoc-11-08-3994-g003.jpgFigure 3. Schematic diagram showing the silastic capsules preparation and surgery implantation Pellets implantation surgery All Instruments and materials used for surgery must be previously sterilized. We recommend steam sterilization (autoclaving). Furthermore, female rats should be weighed for the doses of anesthetics and medications be given according to individual body weight.The animals must be anesthetized with ketamine (55 mg/kg, IP) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, IP) and perform aseptic procedures as follows: shave the rats, scrub the surgical site with antiseptic solution (Betadine).Note: In this protocol we use injectable anesthesia. However, is possible to use other approach such as inhaled anesthetics. With the aid of a small scissors, make a discreet incision (0.5 cm) and insert the tip of the scissors to separate the tissue, a subcutaneous pocket is formed to store the pellet. This surgery is minimally invasive and quick. After surgery, the animals must receive prophylactic antibiotics (Pentabiotico 0.2 ml/rat, i.m.) and anti-inflammatory treatment (Banamine, 2.5 mg/kg, s.c).Vaginal smears collection and estrous cycle evaluation (Figure 4)The estrous cycle of female rats lasts an average of 4 to 5 days and has 4 distinct phases: proestrus, estrus, metestrus (or diestrus I) and diestrus (or diestrus II), which can be easily identified by the cell types observed in the vaginal smear (Marcondes et al., 2002).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3994/bioprotoc-11-08-3994-g004.jpgFigure 4. Schematic diagram showing the vaginal smear collection and estrous cycle evaluation. Photomicrography (10×) kindly provided by Thalita de Oliveira Gonçalves and Guilherme de Souza Gagliano.",
    "With one hand, hold the animal firmly so that the vagina is visible. With the other hand, gently insert the tip of a plastic pipette previously filled with 0.9% NaCl (approx. 10 μl) into the vagina of the rat, it is not necessary to deepen the pipette. Press the rubber on the surface of the pipette to push the NaCl, repeat this process twice as if washing (Figure 4A-1).Remove the vaginal fluid and deposit a drop on a glass slide (Figure 4B). Discard the excess of the collected smear in the specific container (Figure 4-3). The pipette must be sanitized between one animal and another, filling it with water (Figure 4-1) and discarding it in container 3. Repeat the wash 3 times, then fill the pipette with 70% alcohol (Figure 4-4) and discard, the pipette will dry immediately and be ready to be reused in another animal. One drop from each rat must to be placed sequentially on the slide (Figure 4B).After collecting the vaginal smear from all rats, the glass slide is ready to be observed under an optical or light microscope without the need for a lens condenser. 10× and 40× objective lenses are suitable for observing fresh material (Figure 4C).When observing the slide under the microscope, it will be possible to recognize 3 distinct cell types: 1) the round and nucleated ones that resemble bunches of grape or fried eggs are non-cornified squamous epithelial cells typically observed during the proestrus; 2) irregular cells, in the shape of a dry leaf or corn flakes, are the cornified epithelial cells, characteristic of estrus; 3) small round cells are the leukocytes present in the diestrus (Figure 4D). Animals in metestrus will present a variety of these cells.",
    "It is important to emphasize that the proportion between them should be used to determine the estrous cycle phases (Marcondes et al., 2002).Note: The collection of the vaginal smear and evaluation of the estrous cycle must be carried out in the early morning, between 7:30 and 9:30 am to prevent the cells present in the vaginal fluid from moving from one phase to the next. Since until close to 90 days after the onset of VCD treatment the proportion of rats that cycle regularly (about 20%) is the same in control rats and those treated with VCD (Carolino et al., 2019). Only control and VCD treated rats cycling regularly be used in the experiments performed before 90 days after starting VCD injections. Euthanasia and blood samples collectionBetween 75 and 85 days after the start of the VCD/oil injections, the animals should be euthanized in the morning, by decapitation or anesthetic overdose (ketamine [110 mg/kg, IP] and xylazine [20 mg/kg, IP].Before starting the decapitation, make sure the guillotine is sharp enough. Quickly and firmly hold the animal and position the head at the height of the trunk between the guillotine blades, once positioned, lower the lever.With the aid of a plastic funnel previously heparinized and identified attached to the polyethylene tube, position the animal's body downwards, facilitating the exit of the blood. Shake the tube gently, facilitating the mixing of blood and heparin to prevent clotting. Store the tube containing blood in a refrigerated environment (2 °C-8 °C).Remove the brain quickly and gently from the skull and freeze it immediately either on dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Store the brain at -70 °C.Centrifuge the blood samples in a refrigerated centrifuge at 1,200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Separate the plasma and store at -70 °C until the assay.",
    "Note: The decapitation must be done the most humane way possible, guaranteeing the animal's well-being as well as the safety of the experimenter. Avoid noise, odors and crowding in the experimental room. The environment should be well lit with circulating air. We recommend using exhaust fans to help dispel specific odors such as blood. We recommend that the guillotine, the sink and the counter be cleaned with water and 70% alcohol to avoid the odor of blood between becapitations."
