    "The following protocol conforms to the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care and has been approved by the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy Animal Care Committee at the University of Toronto.\n1. Prepare Required Reagents as Described in Table 1\nAdd protease and phosphatase (if necessary) inhibitors to all sucrose solutions, buffers and ddH2O at concentrations outlined in Table 1. IMPORTANT: Perform all of the steps at 4 °C and pre-cool all of the reagents and equipment prior to the start of the experiment. Label all tubes, including ultracentrifuge tubes, with permanent marker.\n2. Dissection of the Appropriate Brain Region\nSacrifice the animal by cervical dislocation or decapitation. House and euthanize animals in accordance with institutional and governmental policies on animal care.\nRapidly remove the brain from the skull and place on an chilled dissection block.\nDissect the appropriate brain region from fresh tissue and proceed to Step 3.\n3. Tissue Homogenization with Motor Driven Glass-Teflon Homogenizer\nPlace 50-100 mg (for SPM), or 100-200 mg (for PSD) of the dissected tissue in a labeled 13 ml polypropylene tube containing 4 ml of 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution. Transfer the sample to a 15 ml tapered glass-Teflon tissue grinder/homogenizer, set the motor drive to 900 rpm (setting 7) and homogenize the sample with 12 strokes over a 30 sec period. Use a different glass-Teflon homogenizer between samples, or rinse the homogenizer with cold distilled water between samples and wipe dry with a Kimwipe. NOTE: Up to 4 g of tissue can be homogenized in 4 ml of 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution, however it is advisable to use less tissue to ensure proper fractionation.",
    "Transfer the homogenized sample back to the same 13 ml polypropylene tube. Reserve 100 μl of homogenate and store at -80 °C for subsequent protein quantification and western blot analysis of the total protein fraction.\n4. Low Speed Centrifugation to Remove the Nuclear Fraction (Yields Supernatant S1)\nCentrifuge the homogenate in a fixed angle rotor at 900 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant (S1) to a new, labeled 13 ml tube and resuspend the nuclear fraction pellet (P1) in 500 μl of 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose. NOTE: The (P1) fraction can be stored at -80 °C and used for western blot analysis of the nuclear fraction.\n5. Enrichment of the Crude Synaptosomal Fraction (Yields Pellet P2)\nCentrifuge the supernatant (S1) at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant (S2) and reserve 500 μl in a microcentrifuge tube to store at -80 °C for subsequent protein quantification and western blot analysis of the cytosolic/light membrane fraction. Resuspend the remaining crude synaptosomal fraction pellet (P2) in 1 ml of 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution and then add another 3 ml of 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant (S2’) and reserve 500 μl in a microcentrifuge tube to store at -80 °C for subsequent protein quantification and western blot analysis of the cytosolic/light membrane fraction. Save the washed crude synaptosomal pellet (P2’) in the polypropylene tube.\n6. Lysing (Hypoosmotic Shock) of the Crude Synaptosomal Fraction",
    "Lyse the crude synaptosomal pellet (P2’) in the polypropylene tube by resuspending it in 1 ml of ddH2O. Add another 3 ml of ddH2O, transfer to a glass-Teflon tissue homogenizer, and homogenize by hand with 3 strokes. NOTE: It is important to perform this step as rapidly as possible and quickly proceed to step 6.2.\nTransfer samples from the homogenizer back into the same 13 ml polypropylene tube and rapidly adjust the sample back to 4 mM HEPES with 16 μl of 1 M HEPES solution, invert to mix.\nRotate samples at 4 °C for 30 min to ensure complete lysing.\n7. Enrichment of the Synaptosomal Membrane Fraction (P3)\nCentrifuge at 25,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Remove the crude vesicular fraction supernatant (S3) and reserve it in a 5 ml tube to store at -80 °C for subsequent protein quantification and western blot analysis. Resuspend the synaptosomal membrane fraction (P3) in 1 ml of 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution.\n8. Preparation of the Discontinuous Sucrose Gradient\nPipet exactly 3.5 ml of 1.2 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution and exactly 3.0 ml each of 1.0 M and 0.8 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution into separate 6 ml snap cap tubes. NOTE: This is done to pre-measure the volumes of the buffers that are used to make the sucrose gradient. Exact measurement of the volumes is important to ensure that the resulting gradients will be balanced for ultracentrifugation.",
    "Using a glass Pasteur pipet and bulb, transfer 1.2 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution to the 12 ml polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube. Carefully layer the 1.0 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution on top of the 1.2 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution. Finally, layer the 0.8 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution on top of the 1.0 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution. Use a fresh Pasteur pipet for each sucrose solution and take care not to disturb the sucrose gradient. Vibrations from a bench vortex or microcentrifuge will disturb the integrity of the gradient.\nUsing a Pasteur pipet, layer the resuspended synaptosomal membrane fraction (P3) on top of the prepared discontinuous sucrose gradient. Ensure that the gradients are balanced by weighing them inside the bucket of the swinging bucket rotor. If the buckets are not balanced, use a P200 pipet to carefully add 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose to the top of the gradient and balance the rotor buckets.\n9. Fractionation of the Synaptic Plasma Membrane (SPM)\nUltracentrifuge in a swinging bucket rotor at 150,000 x g for 2 hr at 4 °C. Carefully remove the sucrose gradients from the ultracentrifuge buckets. Using an 18 G needle and a 1 ml syringe, puncture the tube at the bottom of the 1.0 M / 1.2 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution interphase and withdraw the synaptic plasma membrane layer (SPM).\nMake note of the volume that each SPM sample occupies in the 1 ml syringe. Place the collected SPM layer in 3.5 ml thick-wall ultracentrifuge tubes, add exactly 2.5 volumes of 4 mM HEPES to adjust the sucrose concentration from 1.2 M to 0.32 M. Once each sample has been adjusted to 0.32 M sucrose, balance the tubes with 0.32 M HEPES-buffered sucrose solution.",
    "Ultracentrifuge in a fixed angle rotor at 200,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Remove and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the synaptic plasma membrane pellet (SPM) in 300 μl of 50 mM HEPES / 2 mM EDTA solution. Store samples at -80 °C until used for western blotting.\n10. Preparation of the Postsynaptic Density Fraction (PSD)\nThaw SPM samples on ice.\nMake a solution of 0.54% Triton X-100 in 50 mM HEPES / 2 mM EDTA solution.\nIn a 5 ml polystyrene tube, combine 2.7 ml of Triton X-100/HEPES/EDTA solution and 300 μl SPM fraction and rotate the sample for 15 min at 4 °C\nTransfer samples to 3.5 ml thick-wall ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuge samples at 32,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nReserve the supernatant (Triton X-100 soluble fraction [TS]) and store at -80 °C. NOTE: At this stage, the pellet represents the “PSD-1T” fraction. A second treatment with detergent will produce a “PSD-2T” fraction. If a PSD-1T fraction is desired, proceed to step 10.6.\n\t\nTo produce a PSD-2T fraction, resuspend the pellet in 3 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 in 50 mM HEPES / 2 mM EDTA solution. Rotate samples for 15 min at 4 °C. Centrifuge samples at 32,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C and proceed to step 10.6.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the postsynaptic (PSD) pellet in 50 mM HEPES / 2 mM EDTA solution. NOTE: The resuspension volume may depend on the size of the pellet; a volume of 50-75 μl is recommended. Because the PSD fraction is a detergent-insoluble fraction, it is often necessary to add 1-2 μl of 0.5% SDS to enable complete resuspension of protein. Store samples at -80 °C until used for western blotting.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
