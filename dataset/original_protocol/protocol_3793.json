    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nChromatin immunoprecipitation and library preparation on single mouse sperm for H3K4me3\nTiming: 5 days\nThis step describes how to perform a sperm-specific native ChIP-sequencing protocol on the sperm of individual mice for H3K4me3, using 8 million sperm cells, based on Hisano et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]. We highlight our methodologies for mononucleosome isolation post-ChIP, as well as our library preparation procedures.\nAntibody preparation (Day 1)\nPrepare 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) solution fresh in 1× PBS: 0.25 g of BSA in 50 mL of chilled 1× PBS. Sterile filter and keep solution on ice.\nResuspend Dynabeads Protein A by inverting stock until slurry becomes uniform. Per mouse, pipet 50 μL of Dynabeads for chromatin immunoprecipitation and 50 μL of Dynabeads for pre-clearing into a 1.5 mL tube.\nPlace Dynabeads on a magnetic rack and slowly remove liquid without disrupting Dynabeads.\nRemove Dynabeads from magnetic rack and wash with 100 μL of chilled 0.5% BSA solution. Minimize retention of Dynabeads in pipette tip by pipetting slowly.\nPlace Dynabeads on a magnetic rack and slowly remove liquid without disrupting the Dynabeads.\nRepeat washing steps d and e twice more for a total of three washes.\nAfter the final wash, resuspend Dynabeads in 80 μL of 0.5% BSA solution for each ChIP tube and 100 μL of 0.5% BSA solution for each pre-clear tube. Distribute 80 μL of the resuspended Dynabeads to 0.2 mL ChIP tubes or 100 μL of resuspended Dynabeads to 0.2 mL input tubes.\nNote: Before the chromatin immunoprecipitation, the digested chromatin will be pre-cleared in a Dynabeads Protein A 0.5% BSA solution without any antibody. This step removes molecules from the chromatin solution that bind to the Dynabeads non-specifically.",
    "Add 20 μL H3K4me3 Cell Signaling antibody (Cat#9751) to each ChIP tube (equivalent to 5 μg of antibody per tube).\nPlace tubes on a rotator at 4°C. Ensure that the tubes undergo the largest possible revolution. Incubate for > 8 h.\nCritical: Incubate in 0.2 mL tubes to prevent Dynabeads from drying out on the rim of a 1.5 mL tube.\nAlternatives: This protocol can be used to probe other histone marks in sperm. However, it is important to optimize antibody concentration used in order to obtain high signal-to-noise ratios and library complexities (see troubleshooting problems 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]). Optimization can be done by performing the described sperm ChIP-seq experiment using multiple antibody titrations, and subsequently performing low-depth sequencing (approximatively 10 million reads). The amount of antibody to use relies on two factors:\nThe breadth of the peak in sperm: a broad mark (e.g., H3K9me3) will require more antibody.\nThe efficiency of the antibody in sperm: this needs to be tested experimentally and may vary by cell type.\nSperm preparation and counting (Day 1)\nCritical: Design all ChIP experiments to include each experimental group in every batch. For example, if you have 20 samples and 4 experimental groups (Lismer et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), perform 5 different ChIP experiments with each batch composed of the 4 experimental groups. Batch effects can occur in sequencing experiments and data should be analyzed to identify the influences experimental day by a principal component clustering analysis. If identified, batch effects can be bioinformatically corrected (Leek et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) if a balanced experimental design is used (Lismer et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nThaw sperm from different experimental groups on ice.\nAdd 500 mL of chilled 1× PBS per tube and gently pipette.\nSpin tubes at 2,600 × g for 6 min at 4°C.\nConfirm the presence of a pellet.",
    "Without disrupting the pellet, remove the supernatant and gently resuspend in 1 mL of chilled 1× PBS.\nRepeat washing steps c–e once more.\nEnsure that sperm is well resuspended in chilled 1× PBS.\nIn new tubes, prepare two 1:10 sperm dilutions in ddH2O for each sample: 10 μL sperm and 1× PBS solution and 90 μL ddH2O.\nAdd 10 μL of diluted sperm to both counting chambers of a Neubauer Improved counting chamber.\nAllow sperm to settle in the hemocytometer for 1 min.\nCount sperm in the 25 middle squares of the hemocytometer grid (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nExtrapolate the total number of sperm per group in 1 mL of 1× PBS tube: Total sperm # = Average of two sperm counts × dilution factor (10) × 10,000.\nCritical: Ensure that sperm tubes are kept on ice during the counting process.\nCritical: The sperm counting step will determine the downstream MNase digestion parameters therefore obtaining accurate and reproducible results is fundamental for this experiment. We recommend practicing the counting step beforehand to achieve counting consistency before using actual experimental sperm. If both sperm count replicates vary by more than 10 sperm counts, make two new 1:10 sperm dilutions in ddH2O and count two diluted sperm replicates again (see troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nIf tubes have over 8 million sperm cells in them, remove enough volume to specifically obtain 8 million sperm cells per tube. Add chilled 1× PBS to obtain a final total volume of 1 mL per tube.",
    "Alternatives: If experimental groups have less than 8 million sperm cells, adjust to obtain uniform sperm numbers across groups, and modify downstream MNase digestion parameters (step 5). We do not recommend using less than 6 million sperm cells as we have never tested it and therefore cannot reliably comment on data quality or read statistics.\nDithiothreitol (DTT) pre-treatment (Day 1)\nCritical: Ensure that benchtop centrifuge is at 20°C–25°C.\nPrepare 1M DTT solution fresh: 77.13 mg DTT in 500 μL ddH2O.\nAdd 50 μL of 1M DTT solution to each sample and incubate for 2 h at 20°C–25°C to release the protamines and relax the sperm chromatin before MNase digestion.\n5 min before the end of the DTT treatment, prepare a fresh 1M NEM solution: 125.13 mg NEM in 1 mL ddH2O.\nNote: NEM is difficult to dissolve. The solution should be incubated at 50°C for 5 min and vortexed.\nFor each tube, add 120 μL from the upper phase of 1M NEM solution while it is still on the heat block. Pipette up and down 20 times to mix well.\nCritical: Do not take the oily bottom phase of the 1M NEM solution. In our hands, doing so will prevent the DTT quenching.\nIncubate solution at 20°C–25°C for 30 min to quench the DTT.\nChromatin preparation (Day 1)\nPrepare 100 mM DTT solution fresh (for Complete Buffer 1.1): 15.4 g DTT in 1 mL ddH2O.\nPrepare Complete Buffer 1.1 Solution using Buffer 1 Stock. For 1 mL:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_713_7.csv\nNote: 100 μL of Complete Buffer 1.1 Solution per 2 million sperm cells will be required (50 μL of Complete Buffer 1.1 + 50 μL to prepare Complete Buffer Detergent 1.2).\nSpin sperm at 2,600 × g for 6 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Critical: After the DTT pre-treatment, washes with 1× PBS must be carried at 20°C–25°C and not at 4°C or the sperm pellet will become brittle and not resuspend.\nCarefully discard supernatant.\nGently resuspend pellet in 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nSpin sperm at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCarefully discard supernatant.\nGently resuspend sperm pellet in Complete Buffer 1.1 solution using 50 μL of Complete Buffer 1.1 Solution per 2 million sperm cells. For 8 million sperm cells, resuspend in 200 μL Complete Buffer 1.1 solution.\nVigorously pipette up and down 20 times. Ensure that sperm is well resuspended.\nAliquot sperm in 50 μL volumes per tube. For 8 million sperm cells, 4 aliquot tubes will be made per experimental sample.\nMake 10% NP-40 stock solution fresh: 100 μL NP-40 + 900 μL ddH2O (for Complete Buffer 1.2).\nNote: NP-40 is very viscous and should be pipetted slowly to obtain accurate measurements.\nMake 10% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) stock solution fresh: 10 mg DOC in 100 μL ddH2O (for Complete Buffer 1.2).\nPrepare Complete Buffer 1.2 Solution: 50 μL of Complete Buffer 1.2 Solution is required per sperm aliquot tube. For 500 μL:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_713_8.csv\nCritical: Vortex for 1 min to ensure that the NP-40 and DOC are entirely dissolved.\nAdd 50 μL of Complete Buffer 1.2 solution to each sperm aliquot tube.\nVigorously pipette up and down 20 times.\nIncubate on ice for 25 min.\nMNase digestion (Day 1)\nCritical: Always titrate MNase with every new batch of MNase stock on practice sperm prior to the ChIP experiment to confirm enzyme efficiency. Once MNase is resuspended, make 7 μL aliquots (30 IU/μL) and store in a −20°C freezer. Do not freeze-thaw aliquots.\nPrepare MNase Buffer Complete solution. For 1 mL (to process 10 aliquots of 2 million sperm):",
    "table:files/protocols_protocol_713_9.csv\nNote: 100 μL of MNase Buffer Complete will be required per 2 milllion sperm cells.\nCritical: Always transport MNase on ice and keep MNase Buffer Complete solution on ice. Do not reuse a thawed aliquot.\nAdd 100 μL of MNase Buffer Complete solution to each tube and mix vigorously by pipetting up and down 20 times.\nIncubate at 37°C for exactly 5 min. Use 30 s intervals between experimental tubes or a multichannel pipette to keep MNase digestion time consistent.\nCritical: MNase digestion starts when the tube enters the heat block. Absolute consistency in the timing of MNase digestion to ensure consistent mononucleosome digestion across experimental groups and batches. A slight variation in digestion time can lead to batch effects. Uniformity and efficiency of MNase digestion across samples in one batch is verified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer low input DNA chip (step 10.k.)\nStop MNase digestion by adding 2 μL of 0.5 M EDTA. Pipette up and down vigorously. Vortex tubes on maximum setting for 5 s.\nPlace tubes on ice for 15 min.\nSpin tubes at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCombine supernatants from aliquot tubes from the same mouse sperm. Pipette supernatant carefully to not aspirate debris and protamines present in the pellet. Keep samples on ice. Each experimental group should yield approximatively 800 μL.\nDissolve one tablet of protease inhibitor in 2 mL of ddH2O. Freeze 50 μL aliquots in a −20°C freezer.\nAdd 50 μL of protease inhibitor cocktail to each 800 μL of pooled supernatants.\nChromatin Dynabeads™ pre-clearing (Day 1)\nNote: Pre-clearing digested chromatin removes molecules that non-specifically bind to Dynabeads Protein A, which is aimed to reduce background and increase specificity.\nPrepare Combined Buffer solution fresh and place on ice.

Remove the upper phase slowly to not disrupt the salts. After the chloroform wash, it is critical to not contaminate the pipette tip with salts or with the bottom phase of the mixture as this will compromise the elution step.

Only run samples on the Bioanalyzer after library preparation. We recommend running the input on the Bioanalyzer alongside the ChIP. Input DNA quantity should be at least half of the total ChIP DNA quantity (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nLow-input mRNA-seq on pre-implantation embryos\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis step describes how to isolate total RNA on approximatively 100 pre-implantation 8-cell embryo cells and build messenger RNA libraries for mRNA-Seq.",
