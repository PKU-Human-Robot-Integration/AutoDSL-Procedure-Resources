    "The first aim of RP-ABPP methodology is to determine probe-reactive proteins and quantify their reactivity. Probe-reactive proteins are identified and quantified through probe treatment in live cells followed by lysis, conjugation of labeled proteins to a reporter tag (biotin-azide), enrichment using streptavidin beads and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, and validation via recombinant expression protocols as described in Matthews et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0012]). Quantitation of this reactivity allows the exclusion of weakly reactive or low-stoichiometry electrophiles to bias toward functional sites. This strategy allows the further pursuit of highly reactive target proteins that have a high likelihood of containing functional electrophiles.\nRP-ABPP experiments begin with treatment of cells with probe, competitor, or probe and competitor mixture, which is followed by proteome harvesting and enrichment. The probe design includes a reactive nucleophile, linker/scaffolds, and an alkyne handle. The competitor is the analog of the probe without the alkyne handle and therefore is not amenable to click chemistry (“non-clickable”). These steps generate labeled soluble and membrane proteomes from the cell culture at a known concentration, which can be used as the starting material for the majority of downstream RP-ABPP experiments. To bias this approach toward targets with near-complete reactivity with the probe and avoid lower-stoichiometry adducts, both enrichment and competition are necessary. Both experiments are achievable using SILAC methodology in which cells are grown in medium containing either natural-abundance lysine and arginine (“light” medium) or 13C- and 15N-enriched amino acid isotopologues (“heavy” medium).",
    "SILAC can be utilized in RP-ABPP enrichment and competition experiments, as shown in Figure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-fig-0003]. In enrichment experiments, heavy cells are treated with probe and light cells with non-clickable competitor to serve as control. In competition experiments, heavy cells are treated the same; however, light cells are treated with probe and an excess amount of competitor (10×). Enrichment and competition can also be shown using gel experiments. For MS-based analysis, labeled proteomes are conjugated to biotin-azide tags via click chemistry and enriched on streptavidin resin to remove unlabeled proteins. Proteins are then digested and analyzed via LC-MS/MS. As the proteins incorporate the amino acids from the SILAC media (heavy or light), peptides will contain a known mass shift. That defined mass shift is extractable via mass spectrometry to quantify differences in the abundance of peptides in the respective proteome by ratiometric comparison. Coelution of isotopically differentiated peptides is a common strategy in RP-ABPP, as will be demonstrated throughout this paper. Proteins with high heavy-to-light ratios for competition and enrichment are deemed to be robust high-reactivity protein targets, and the reactivity is quantified using these ratios (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-fig-0003]). Such profiling experiments were adapted from advanced protocols with electrophilic probes (Adibekian et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0001]; Hulce, Cognetta, Niphakis, Tully, & Cravatt, 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0008]; Martin, Wang, Adibekian, Tully, & Cravatt, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0011]; Niphakis et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0013]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b0bbba6a-37a4-467a-98c4-8a8946b7ea55/cpch86-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nSchematics for characterization of protein targets and their sites of probe labeling.

    "Once high-reactivity targets have been determined, they can be validated by demonstrating hydrazine reactivity as an intrinsic property of the protein targets shared by both the endogenous and recombinant forms of these proteins. This validation is performed by treatment of transfected cells with probe, followed by conjugation to azide-rhodamine, and visualization of a strong fluorescent band at the appropriate molecular weight. This band should be absent in “mock”-transfected cells treated with excess non-clickable agents as this should block probe labeling of each protein. In addition, recombinant expression of each protein and lack of expression in “mock”-transfected control cells are confirmed by western blotting. In order to perform these transfections, target genes need to be obtained in mammalian expression vectors. These vectors can be purchased or made using cloning protocols as previously described (Matthews et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0012]).\nMaterials\nHydrazinium chloride salts of probes and competitors (non-clickable analogs), synthesized in house (Matthews et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0012])\nDimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

These steps generate labeled soluble and membrane proteomes at a known concentration from cell culture. The proteomes are then used as the starting material for the rest of the RP-ABPP experiments. These steps can be modified by type of medium, cell, and probe; thus, SILAC-specific labeling and preparation steps are included later, in the section on SILAC RP-ABPP (steps 9-11).\n1. Prepare working stock solutions (∼0.2-3 M) of probe and competitor in H2O with or without 10% DMSO, depending on the solubility of the hydrazinium hydrochloride salt forms of the compounds. Titrate the solutions to pH ∼6.5-7 with concentrated sodium hydroxide using Colorphast pH indicator strips. Store solutions in aliquots at –80°C.\nThese preparations are chemically stable for several months and should be analyzed prior to use to confirm their integrity.\n2.

Plate and grow cells to near complete confluence at the time of treatment.",
    "4. Wash cells with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and replenish with serum-free DMEM (∼15% of normal passage volume, e.g., a 10-cm plate normally passaged with 10 ml medium would receive 1.5 ml) supplemented with 10 mM Na-HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). Incubate cells with probe (3 and 1 mM for alkyl and aryl probes, respectively) in the absence or presence of 10-fold excess non-clickable analogs (competitors; 30 and 10 mM for propyl and phenyl hydrazine, respectively) for 30 min at 37°C.

No cell death was observed, and the cells remained completely viable, indistinguishable from untreated cells.\n5. Wash cells with ice-cold PBS to remove the probe-containing medium, harvest by scraping, collect by centrifugation (1400 × g, 3 min, 4°C), wash again by resuspension in ice-cold PBS, and freeze as pellets at –80°C (pellets are stable for months) until ready to proceed with proteome preparation.\nProteome preparation\n6. Resuspend cell pellets on ice in PBS (100-500 µl) and lyse with a Branson Sonifier probe sonicator (two sets of 6-10 pulses, 15% duty cycle, output setting 3-5). Adjust resuspension volume and sonication power appropriately for cell pellet yield.\n7. Separate soluble and membrane proteomes by ultracentrifugation for 30-45 min at 100,000 × g, 4°C.\n8. Determine protein concentrations for each fraction using the DC protein assay™ (similar to the Lowry assay) on a microplate reader.\nSILAC RP-ABPP\n9.

    "Follow the in situ labeling protocol described in steps 1-5, passaging each cell line a minimum of six doublings in SILAC DMEM (lysine and arginine free) containing dFBS supplemented with either isotopically enriched L-[13C615N2]lysine hydrochloride and L-[13C615N4]arginine hydrochloride or natural-abundance isotopologues (100 μg/ml each, 550 and 475 μM, respectively). Treat isotopically light cells with non-clickable analog (at the same concentration of probe in the “enrichment” experiments) or the probe in the presence of 10-fold excess non-clickable analog as a competitor (in competition experiments). Treat isotopically heavy cells with the probe for both types of experiments.\nThese treatments are performed in non-SILAC medium, which, we recognize, by introducing natural-abundance amino acids, could potentially yield false-negative targets that have very short half-lives (<30 min).\nMix isotopically heavy and light whole cell lysates in equal proportions, and follow the proteome preparation procedure described in steps 6-8, starting with lysing the cells.\nDilute the fractionated equimolar mixture of heavy and light soluble proteomes (∼1-1.5 mg) to 1 ml in PBS.\nAdd 110 µl of a freshly prepared “click” reagent mixture containing 0.1 mM tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine (TBTA; 60 µl/sample, 1.7 mM in 4:1 DMSO:t-BuOH), 1 mM CuSO4 (20 µl/sample, 50 mM in H2O), 100 μM biotin-azide (10 µl/sample, 10 mM in DMSO), and freshly prepared 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; 20 µl/sample, 50 mM in PBS or H2O) to each sample (1 ml).

    "Numerous mass spectrometry protocols exist, and historically multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) mass spectrometry protocols have been used for ABPP and RP-ABPP (Washburn, Wolters, & Yates, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0019]). However, we have adapted a one-dimensional method (substeps a-g) with a shorter run time for RP-ABPP (Blaesi et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0004]).\n         \na.Desalt the acidified peptide mixture using C18 Stage Tips.\nb.Concentrate desalted samples under reduced pressure in an evacuated centrifuge (SpeedVac) and redissolve in 10 µl of diluent (98% H2O, 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) for nanoLC-MS/MS analysis.\nc.Inject a 3- to 5-µl aliquot of this solution in diluent via a nano-LC system onto a 75-µm-inner-diameter fused-silica capillary column hand-packed with C18 resin and with a laser-pulled tip in solvent A (0.1% formic acid in H2O).\nd.Develop the column with a 60-min gradient of 5%-100% solvent B (20% H2O, 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid).\ne.Ionize peptides in positive-ion mode with a flow rate of 300 nl/min and an applied voltage of 2.3 kV.\nf.Collect spectra in a data-dependent mode such that each scan cycle involves a single high-resolution (30,000) full MS spectrum of parent ions (MS1 scan from 400 to 1800 m/z) collected in the Orbitrap Fusion coupled to a 30 CID-induced fragmentation (MS2) scans in the ion trap of the 30 most abundant parent ions from the MS1 scan.\ng.Exclude parent ions with unassigned of +1 charge stated by the instrument for fragmentation.

    "The second aim of RP-ABPP is to determine the site of electrophilic reactivity on each protein target. The peptide labeled is found using isoTOP-ABPP (Weerapana et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0021]; Weerapana, Speers, & Cravatt, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0020]) experiments, and the specific amino acid residue labeled is found using a hybrid sequencing approach. To identify the peptide labeled, rather than the whole protein, a site-specific profiling method called isoTOP ABPP is used (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-fig-0003]; Weerapana et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0020]; Weerapana et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0021]). Following probe treatment of non-SILAC cells, this method leverages the conjugation to isotopically differentiated, protease-cleavable biotin-TEV (tobacco etch virus) tags. After conjugation to heavy and light tags, labeled proteomes are enriched on streptavidin beads and then on-bead digestion is performed. All unlabeled peptides are then discarded and the remaining labeled peptides are released from the beads through cleavage of the tag (by TEV protease), ultimately generating probe-labeled peptides as mass-differentiated pairs. The peptide harboring the labeled residue can be found using the coeluting pair with heavy and light tags (plotted in dark and light green, respectively, in Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-fig-0003]). Determining which peptide is labeled can give information about where the reactivity is located in the sequence of the protein (e.g., active site, N-terminus, etc.). These searches enable differentiation between probe-labeled peptides and other peptides in the sample regardless of identity or mass. To further resolve the site labeled and the mass of the probe-captured PTM, the MS2 spectra from the isoTOP experiments is assigned via sequencing of the MS2 spectral assignments. The residue(s) containing the modification can be identified, as they will show the known mass shift of the fragmented heavy/light tag, containing covalently bound probe and conjugated biotin-TEV tag.",
    "After all peaks are identified as either an amino acid or amino acid with fragmented tag, the mass of the bound electrophile can be calculated within 1 ppm error. Once the amino acid containing the reactive electrophile has been identified, the next step is to validate and confirm the location by mutating the specific residue. The site is confirmed if mutation of the site enables visualization of a loss of probe labeling. Additionally, expression should be detectable for both the wild-type and mutant proteins and confirmed via western blot.",
    "Lastly, these results are validated using site-specific mutagenic analysis based on the loss of in-gel fluorescence labeling upon alteration of the involved amino acid in conjunction with continued expression of both the wild-type and mutant proteins (confirmed via western blot). Characterization of the electrophilic site yields information about where the reactivity is located within the greater context of the protein. Determining this site paves the way for a large variety of downstream experiments, including monitoring the electrophile, examining its installation and regulation, and investigating its function. Additionally, one critical output of peptide sequencing is the mass of the probe-captured electrophile, which is used to determine the PTM structure. IsoTOP-ABPP, de novo sequencing, and mutagenic analysis protocols are performed as described in Matthews et al.

    "Collect proteomics data as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-prot-0001], step 10. Search data on the MS1 level for paired spectra of coeluting peaks (shown at right in Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-fig-0004]). Search every recorded monoisotopic precursor mass 6.0138 Da (±5 ppm) upstream and downstream in each total ion (MS1) spectrum for a possible isotopic partner, taking into account +2 and +3 charge state differences (3.0069 and 2.0046 Da, respectively). Require that the relative intensity of the monoisotopic peak be ≥5% of the base peak of each spectrum, that there be at least three peaks in each isotope profile (envelope), and that the Euclidean distance between the two isotope profiles be ≤0.2.\nThis in-house-generated script is now publicly available to download from GitHub at https://github.com/matthewslab/probe[href=https://github.com/matthewslab/probe].\nGroup pairs with the same m/z values (±5 ppm) and retention times to eliminate duplicates.\nAnalyze pairs of parent ions from transfected versus mock-transfected cells and from three biological replicates.\nThis search is valuable because it allows all probe-labeled peptides, regardless of their mass or identity, to be distinguished from other ions in the sample through their unique pair feature with a defined mass differential.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1afa47b6-685c-4233-9bb3-3c2a733e4a88/cpch86-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nSpectra assignment and stoichiometric measurement of the modified peptide. (A) Search strategy to determine the probe-labeled site from isoTOP ABPP data. To determine the peptide containing the modification, MS1 searches for the coeluting pair with the specified mass difference are performed. To determine the residue labeled, MS2 spectra are assigned by de novo sequencing. (B) Scheme of stoichiometry measurement for modified peptide. Using a known quantity of synthetic standards of modified and total protein allows the calculation of fractional occupancy.\nDe novo sequencing",
    "3. Assign the MS2 spectra manually (depicted at left in Fig 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-fig-0004]). Modify instrument method such that both the parent and fragment ions are measured in the Orbitrap Fusion instrument to gain high-resolution data for both (resolutions for MS1 and MS2 were set at 30,000 and 7500, respectively) to be certain of the peak assignments and charge state of the tag-specific b-ions. Select only the five most abundant parent ions for fragmentation per cycle (versus 30 if the spectra are collected in the ion trap) to account for increased scan time. Extend the number of MS2 spectra collected per cycle to ten if the data are generated on the Orbitrap.\n4. Search the MS2 spectra for diagnostic ions of the peptide. Find highly abundant fragments that represent diagnostic markers for the unmodified portion of the peptide and other fragmentation products representing the portion that contains the modification and that is differentially labeled by the isotopic tags. Compare the spectra for the heavy and light peptides and observe the appropriate ion shift appropriately (6.0138 Da).\n5. Use RawConverter to extract accurate monoisotopic m/z values for each MS2 spectra. Downstream structure determination will be based on the correct precursor mass calculated from the residue containing the fragmented tag, as further described in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-prot-0003].\nMutagenic analysis\n6. Generate mutants with primers containing the desired mutations and their respective complements.\n7. Transfect cells as described above in validation via recombinant expression.\n8. Label and prepare proteomes as described above in in situ labeling and proteome preparation sections.\n9. Conjugate to fluorophore, visualize via in-gel fluorescence, and perform western blotting as described above in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-prot-0001], step 15.",
    "The site is confirmed if mutation of the site results in visualization of a loss of probe labeling while expression of both the wild-type and mutant proteins remains present (confirmed via western blot).",
    "The third and final goal of RP-ABPP is to determine the structure of the electrophile PTM. Initially, a structure match is proposed using the mass information about the probe-captured PTM from de novo sequencing and chemical intuition about the residue and probe chemical reactivity. Information about enzyme class or similar motifs may also be useful. Here, peptides are coeluted with synthetic standards to (1) confirm the proposed structure, as well as providing another confirmation of the site of labeling, and (2) quantify the fraction of protein bearing the modification inside the cell. Peptide coelution protocol is performed as described (Matthews et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-bib-0012]). Validation of electrophilic site and structure utilizes coelution of isotopically differentiated samples, light synthesized peptide with proposed probe-captured electrophile PTM, and probe-labeled heavy SILAC cells. The fraction of modified protein can be determined by coeluting (light) synthetic modified and internal standards with (heavy) endogenous modified and internal peptides as depicted in Figure 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-fig-0004]. In these experiments, the internal peptide represents the total protein in the cell (both modified and unmodified protein). The absolute quantities of both the endogenous modified and internal peptides can be calculated using the known amounts of the respective standards added to the sample and the relative peak areas of the standard to the endogenous peptides, as shown by fractional occupancy in Figure 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.86#cpch86-fig-0004].
