    "IncubationClean the fertilized chicken eggs with distilled water and tissue, and incubate them in a rotating incubator (37 °C and 60% humidity).Opening of the eggs (day 3 of incubation)In the first step, clean the eggshell with ethanol on the side where the window will be made. Work under a laminar flow hood.Put the egg sideways on an egg tray. Punch a hole in the bottom of the egg using a pair of sharp scissors (Figure 2A).Now, remove approximately 3 ml of albumen with a syringe (Figure 2B). Make sure to introduce the needle in a steep angle in order to avoid injuring the egg yolk.Discard the removed albumen and close the hole with a stripe of adhesive tape.To avoid too much crumbling of the eggshell, put a stripe (long enough to cover the window that will be cut) of adhesive tape on the side of the egg (Figure 2C).Again, using a sharp scissor punch a hole on one side of the scotch tape in order to insert the scissors into the egg. Now, cut out an oval window (Figure 2D).Discard the cut out eggshell and close the window with an additional stripe of tape (Figure 2E).From now on the egg is incubated in a stationary incubator on an egg tray (37 °C, 60% humidity).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190630/20190630183943_1292.jpgFigure 2. Opening of the eggs. At day 3 of incubation, the eggs are opened and further kept in a stationary incubator. In a first step, a small hole is punched into the eggshell at the “bottom” of the egg (A). Then, around 3 ml of albumen are removed using a syringe and the hole is closed with adhesive tape (B). Another stripe of tape is glued on the side of the egg (C).",
    "A window is cut in the area of the scotch to avoid eggshell crumbs to fall on the membrane, using sharp scissors (D). Finally, the window is closed with an additional stripe of tape (E).Preparation of collagen scaffolds (24 h before seeding)Work in a laminar flow hood. Punch one collagen scaffold per sample.Use sterile tweezers and a blade to cut off an appropriate amount of the collagen sponge.It is best to punch out the scaffolds in a sterile Petri dish. Use an 8 mm biopsy punch to get the number of scaffolds needed.Soak the scaffolds in the medium that will be used later for cell seeding overnight or over the weekend at 4 °C in a 50 ml Falcon tube.Seeding cancer cells (Day 7 of incubation)Prepare cancer cells for seeding. To this end, the cells are detached with Accutase. Accutase is supposed to be less harsh on the cells during detachment than trypsin. We experienced better results when the cells were detached with Accutase. However, this effect could be cell line dependent and in some cases, Accutase might be replaced with Trypsin.Cells are counted and a cell suspension of 1 x 106 cells in 20 µl (= 5 x 106 cells in 1 ml) is prepared that is needed per CAM per scaffold.Preheat the prepared scaffolds in a water bath at 37 °C.Prepare seeding cells on the membrane in a laminar flow hood. Prepare an egg tray, sterile tweezers, Petri dishes and pipettes.Take the scaffolds out of the tube and drip them in a Petri dish.Take an egg out of the incubator, put it into the hood and remove the adhesive tape that is closing the window.",
    "Pipette 20 µl of cell suspension on a scaffold in the Petri dish and put the scaffold upside-down, so that the cells are sandwiched between the CAM and the scaffold, onto the membrane in the egg.Close the window with a new stripe of tape and put the egg back into the incubator.Harvesting of the tumors (Day 14 of incubation)Put the eggs on ice (for at least 30 min).During this time, prepare 200 ml (for around 30 samples) of Carnoy’s fixative (see Recipes). Work under a fume hood.Cut the window in the eggshells wider (again use sharp scissors; the adhesive tape can be cut through), to enable easier handling (Figure 3A).If wanted, take pictures of the tumor in the CAM using a stereomicroscope. If the tumor cells express green or red fluorescent protein (GFP or RFP) and the respective channels are available on your stereomicroscope, the fluorescence can be helpful to localize the microtumor.Cut out the area of the CAM containing the tumor using sharp scissors and tweezers (Figure 3B).Put the removed CAM with the tumor in formalin and place it on an embedding sponge (Figure 3C). Formalin is used to presoak the embedding sponge and to spread out the CAM on the sponge. Carnoy’s fixative used later is quite aggressive and changes the rigidity of the sponges, and is therefore not recommended to use for spreading out the membrane. Take the sample out and drip dry. Put the sponge into a labeled embedding mold and cover the sample with an additional sponge, so that the tumor is sandwiched between two sponges (Figure 3D).Close the mold and put the sample in Carnoy’s fixative for 12 h.Melt paraffin pellets of about 260 g in two suitable plastic containers (final volume about 400 ml) at 56-60 °C, overnight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190630/20190630184015_7771.jpgFigure 3. Harvesting of the tumor.",
    "To harvest the tumors, the eggs are put on ice for at least 30 min. During this time, the windows are enlarged to enable a more precise handling (A). If desired, pictures of the tumors in the egg can now be taken. Labeling of the tumor cells with a fluorophore may help to identify the area of tumor if the scaffold is barely visible. Then the part of the CAM around the tumor is excised (B), sandwiched between two embedding sponges (C) and placed in an embedding mold (D). The samples are now ready to be fixed, plunged in paraffin and embedded.Dehydration and embedding (12 h after harvesting)After 12 h of fixation start the dehydration process.Put the fixed tissue 2 times in methanol for 30 min each.Afterwards, put the samples 2 times in ethanol for 20 min each.This is followed by 2 Xylene baths for 15 min each.Now, drip-dry cassettes on paper tissue, to remove as much Xylene as possible.Incubate the samples twice each for 30 min at 56 °C in warm paraffin to allow soaking of the tissue.Cutting and stainingFor further processing (embedding, cutting and staining), the samples were given to a routine histology pathology laboratory."
