    "Growing Nicotiana benthamiana plantsSow N. benthamiana seeds in a 1:1 mix of potting soil and vermiculite and place in a growth room at 25°C and 65% relative humidity under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod with a light intensity of 130 mE m-2·s-1.Transfer 9-day-old seedlings into individual pots and allow them to grow under the same growth conditions until they are 4-5 weeks old (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4116/bioprotoc-11-15-4116-g001.jpgFigure 1. Growth of Nicotiana benthamiana seedlings in soil. Red arrows indicate leaves suitable for infiltration.Transient expression using Agrobacterium tumefaciens (hereafter, Agrobacterium)Note: This is a standard procedure detailed in Li (2011).This part of the protocol is optional to perform transient gene expression or gene silencing prior to R. solanacearum inoculation. If this step is not needed, proceed to Section C.Prepare and autoclave LB medium with and without agar. Allow LB medium with agar to cool until the bottle can be touched with bare hands (but is still in liquid form), add the appropriate antibiotics, and pour the medium into Petri dishes under a sterile flow hood.Streak out the Agrobacterium strains carrying the desired plasmids (see Note 1) onto solid LB medium and incubate at 28°C for 24 h. Incubate for a longer time if bacterial colonies need to be isolated.Collect Agrobacterium biomass directly from the Petri dish using a sterile pipette tip and resuspend in 1 ml infiltration buffer. Dilute 10-fold and measure OD600 using a spectrophotometer.Prepare an Agrobacterium suspension with a final concentration of OD600 = 0.2-0.5 in infiltration buffer.Select fully expanded leaves of 4-5-week-old N. benthamiana plants for infiltration (Figure 2). Using a permanent marker pen, draw a circle on each half of the leaf to control the area for infiltration. On the abaxial side of the leaf, prick softly at the center of the circle with a needle (e.g.",
    ", from a 1-ml syringe).Note: Infiltration time: it is better to inoculate R. solanacearum in the morning to obtain reproducible and robust infection results. Therefore, it is advised to infiltrate Agrobacterium in the morning and leave 24 hours as a suitable time for heterologous gene expression before R. solanacearum inoculation. For RNAi-mediated silencing, we leave 3-9 days between Agrobacterium and R. solanacearum inoculation, depending on the silencing efficiency of each construct (see Note 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4116/bioprotoc-11-15-4116-g002.jpgFigure 2. Illustration of the infiltration step Infiltrate the Agrobacterium suspension carefully into the marked area.To this end, place a finger on the adaxial side of the leaf and place the needleless syringe at the same spot on the abaxial side (avoid spots with excessive protuberant veins).Use a 90° angle to avoid excessive spillage of the Agrobacterium suspension, but press gently on the leaf to avoid tissue damage.Slowly press the plunger until the Agrobacterium suspension starts filling the plant tissue, which becomes visibly darker upon soaking. Agrobacterium containing the plasmid for gene expression/silencing and the control plasmid can be infiltrated side-by-side in the same leaf to avoid leaf-to-leaf variation (see notes).Wipe the wet surface of the leaf gently with tissue paper and correct the circles (if necessary) with the actual infiltrated area.Notes: Infiltration of samples/controls: the different Agrobacterium strains used for transient gene expression/silencing and the control strain can be infiltrated in each half of the same leaf to avoid leaf-to-leaf variation. In such cases, bacterial numbers can also be analyzed as a ratio of the bacterial growth in both halves of the leaf. However, it is important to note that, if the transiently expressed gene/protein induces systemic responses, these could also affect the other half of the leaf. Therefore, the choice should be made depending on the specific nature of the transiently expressed gene.",
    "Infiltration of N. benthamiana leaves works better in dry leaves without water droplets from condensation or contact with other leaves. Some practice is advised (choice of infiltrated area, position of hands, pressure over the leaf tissue and the plunger, etc.) to optimize leaf infiltration before the actual experiment. Place the plants back into the growth chamber at 25°C and 65% relative humidity under a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod with a light intensity of 130 mE m-2·s-1.Inoculation with Ralstonia solanacearum Y45 (Figure 3)Select a R. solanacearum strain that is pathogenic in N. benthamiana (e.g., Y45; [Li et al., 2011; Sang et al., 2020]). If Agrobacterium was previously infiltrated into plant tissues, the R. solanacearum strain used should be resistant to an antibiotic that allows the differentiation of Y45 from the existing Agrobacteria at the time of sampling (see Note 2).Prepare and autoclave phi medium with and without agar. Allow the phi medium with agar to cool until the bottle can be touched with bare hands (but is still in liquid form), then add 5 ml/L 1% TTC stock solution and 25 ml/L 20% glucose stock solution.Streak out Y45 onto solid phi medium and incubate at 28°C for 2 days.Select pink colonies and pick using a sterile pipette tip to inoculate 10 ml phi liquid medium in a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube. Incubate the cultures on a shaker at 28°C overnight.Centrifuge the suspensions for 5 min at 4,000 × g. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 10 ml sterile distilled water. Measure OD600 using a spectrophotometer. A suspension in distilled water with an OD600 = 1 contains approximately 109 cfu/ml (Morel et al., 2018).",
    "Note: In our experience, resuspending the bacteria in sterile distilled water (or other solution, such as MgCl2) does not affect the viability or virulence of R. solanacearum. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4116/bioprotoc-11-15-4116-g003.jpgFigure 3. Ralstonia solanacearum inoculation and collection. A. Bacteria growing on solid phi medium with TTC. B. Collection of bacterial biomass from pink colonies using a pipette tip. C. Bacterial culture after a 14-h overnight incubation (OD600 = 1.08). D. Bacterial suspension in sterile distilled water (left).Prepare a suspension of Y45 at the final desired concentration, depending on your requirements, by performing serial dilutions using sterile distilled water. Consider the possibility of testing the virulence of different doses of your specific strain under your specific experimental conditions. Under our conditions, we selected 105 cfu/ml as a suitable concentration that allows reproducible bacterial replication without causing the development of necrotic symptoms during the experimental period (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4116/bioprotoc-11-15-4116-g004.jpgFigure 4. Symptoms of N. benthamiana tissues inoculated with different doses of Y45 at the indicated days post-inoculation (dpi) with R. solanacearum. Upper images show the adaxial sides, and lower images show the abaxial sides.Select fully expanded leaves of 4-5-week-old N. benthamiana plants for infiltration (Figure 1). If Agrobacterium was previously infiltrated (Section B; see note at the Step B6 regarding infiltration time), infiltrate Y45 into the marked circles using a 1-ml needleless syringe as previously performed for Agrobacterium (Figure 2). Dry the surface of the leaves using tissue paper to remove residual bacterial inoculum from the leaf surface and place the inoculated plants in the growth chamber until sample collection.Note: After Y45 infiltration, we usually place plants in a different growth chamber at 27°C and 75% relative humidity since R.",
    "solanacearum infection is more efficient and reproducible at a higher temperature and humidity; however, a specific test experiment could be conducted to determine the efficiency and reproducibility of infection depending on the availability of growth chambers under these conditions. Sample collectionPrepare 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and measure their weight using an electronic balance.Cut the inoculated leaves using scissors and place them in a clean Petri dish containing sterile distilled water. Immerse both sides of the leaf in water for 5 s to wash the leaf surface and remove the surface water by placing the leaf on clean tissue paper.Collect 4 leaf discs (4 mm diameter) from each infiltrated area (avoiding areas with potential damage from the infiltration step) using a sterile cork borer and transfer the discs to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Figure 5). Measure the weight of the tubes again.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4116/bioprotoc-11-15-4116-g005.jpgFigure 5. Collection of samples. A. Four leaf discs collected in 1.5-ml tubes using a 4-mm diameter cork borer. B. Homogenized plant tissue in 1 ml sterile water.Add 3 small metal beads to each tube using tweezers, followed by 100 μl sterile distilled water. Grind plant tissue using a tissue grinder at a frequency of 25 oscillations/s for 2 min.Add 900 μl sterile distilled water to the homogenized tissue and mix well using a vortex (Figure 5). Perform serial dilutions of the homogenized tissue by placing 100 μl in 900 μl sterile distilled water. Remember to change pipette tips between each dilution to avoid carryover of bacteria from higher dilutions.Spread 50 μl appropriate dilutions onto solid phi medium plates containing the appropriate antibiotic to differentiate Y45 colonies from the existing Agrobacteria in the homogenized tissue (see Notes). See the legend of Figure 6 for an estimation of the dilutions plated at each time point.",
    "Spreading onto plates can be performed manually using a sterile spreader, sterile plastic beads, or the bottom of a sterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, or using a spiral plater (optional, see notes) (Figure 6).Notes: Spreading colonies onto plates: disinfect hands with 75% alcohol before plating, and work under a sterile flow hood. An alcohol lamp can be used to avoid contamination if working on a bench. If plates are too wet after spreading the sample dilutions, they can be subsequently dried under a flow hood to obtain clear single colonies. Spiral plater: if available, a spiral plating machine can be used to spread bacterial dilutions. This is particularly useful for large-scale experiments, where numerous samples are required. There is no significant difference in the results obtained by plating manually and those obtained using the machine, as shown in Figure 6A and 6B. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4116/bioprotoc-11-15-4116-g006.jpgFigure 6. Ralstonia solanacearum Y45 growth. A. Colonies obtained on solid phi medium plates using the same bacterial dilution, by manual spreading or using the spiral plating machine. B. Comparison of cfu numbers using manual spreading or the spiral plating machine. C. Time-course experiment to determine Y45 growth. N. benthamiana leaves were first inoculated with Agrobacterium to express GFP (used as a control protein in our assays); one day later, a 105 cfu/ml inoculum of Y45 was infiltrated into the same leaves. Samples were then collected at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) with Y45, as indicated. To count these numbers, 100 (undiluted) and 10-1 dilutions were plated 1 dpi, 10-1, and 10-3 dilutions were plated 2 dpi, 10-3 and 10-4 dilutions were plated 3 dpi, and 10-4 and 10-5 dilutions were plated 4 dpi.Incubate the plates upright (see Notes) at 28°C for 2 days. Count the colonies and process the data.Note: Incubation of R.",
    "solanacearum after sampling: colonies of R. solanacearum are very mucoid; therefore, plates should be incubated upright to avoid bacterial secretions dripping."
