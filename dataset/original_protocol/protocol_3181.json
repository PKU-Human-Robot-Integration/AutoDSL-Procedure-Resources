Add approximately 400–500 μL of culture\n        media to each well, so that the cells are completely covered to prevent\n        drying out.\n      \nNote: The number of cells needed to\n      achieve the proper confluency is dependent upon cell line and length of\n      cell culture\n    \nCritical: Make certain to plate cells\n      at a density that will not cause overcrowding. Cells should be a monolayer\n      at time of fixation.\n    \n        Place the plate in a 37°C 5% CO2 incubator and incubate 16–24\n        h.\n      \n        The following morning, remove media and add approximately 500 μL of\n        sterile 1× PBS to each well.\n      \n        Gently rinse the cells by running PBS over the coverslip to remove any\n        dead or unattached cells.\n      \nCritical: Take care not to disturb\n      attached cells.\n    \n        Remove PBS and add 500 μL of culture media. Continue to incubate cells\n        until ready for fixation.\n      \nNote: If cells need to be treated, after\n      PBS wash, add appropriate culture media with reagents. Continue to\n      incubate cells in the incubator until intended length of cell treatment is\n      concluded.\n    \nPart 2: Staining\nTiming: 18–24 h\n      Part 2 of this protocol describes the steps for fixing and staining cells\n      and nuclei for nuclear pore quantification.\n    \n        Remove culture media from cells and wash with 1× PBS. Fix cells in\n        ∼500 μL 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 20–25°C.\n      \nWash cells 3 times with 1× PBS.",
    "Note: Fixation time can be optimized for\n      each user with other cell types for best results.\n    \nAlternatives: Cells can be fixed\n      in 100% methanol (MeOH) at −20°C for 10 min followed by washing 3 times\n      with 1× PBS. However, it is recommended that fixations be optimized for\n      each cell type and antibody since not all antibodies will work with MeOH.\n    \nNote: Cells can be store for several\n      months in PBS at 4°C. However, for best results it is recommended they be\n      stained within 4 weeks.\n    \n        Remove PBS from previously fixed cells and permeabilize with ∼500 μL of\n        0.5% Triton-X 100 to completely cover the cells. Incubate for 10 min at\n        20–25°C.\n      \n        Wash cells one time with 1× PBS and block by adding ∼500 μL blocking\n        buffer. Incubate for 2 h at 20–25°C.\n      \n        While blocking, prepare primary antibody master mix.\n        \n            Dilute primary antibody in blocking buffer using manufacturers\n            recommended dilution.\n          \n            Calculate a minimum of 400–500 μL per well. If using more than one\n            primary antibody, dilute all antibodies in the same buffer solution\n            to intended concentration.\n          \nStore at 4°C until ready to use.\n        After 2 h, remove blocking buffer and add diluted primary antibody\n        mixture to each well. Incubate at 4°C for 16–24 h.\n      \nAlternatives: Add ∼ 100 μL of\n      diluted antibody to the coverslip and cover with a small piece of parafilm\n      to prevent evaporation and drying.\n    \nNote: Mab414 (1:400 dilution) (Abcam,\n      ab24609) is used in this example to stain nuclear pores. Many research\n      papers have used monoclonal antibody (Mab414) for detection of nuclear\n      pore complexes. This antibody recognizes the nucleoporins, Nup62, Nup153,\n      and Nup358. Because the Mab414 antibody is commonly used in published\n      studies, we have utilized it in this protocol. However, we have achieved\n      acceptable confocal microscopy images also with a monoclonal Nup98\n      antibody.",
    "The following morning, remove primary antibody and wash cells in 1× PBS\n        and rock for 5 min at 20–25°C. Repeat wash for a total of 3 times.\n      \n        While washing cells, dilute secondary antibody in 1× PBS according to\n        manufacturer’s recommended dilution.\n      \nNote: If using more than one secondary\n      antibody, dilute all antibodies in the same 1× PBS buffer solution as done\n      in step 11.\n    \n        Remove third PBS wash and add 400–500 μL of secondary antibody solution\n        to each well. Incubate the cells at 20–25°C in the dark for 2 h.\n      \nAlternatives: Add ∼ 100 μL of\n      diluted antibody to the coverslip and cover with a small piece of parafilm\n      to prevent evaporation and drying.\n    \nCritical: Be sure plate is stored in\n      complete darkness, either in a drawer or covered with aluminum foil.\n    \n        After 2 h, remove secondary antibody and wash cells 3 times in 1× PBS\n        for 5 min as in step 13.\n      \n        Dilute Hoechst in 1× PBS at approximately 1:500–1:1000 or optimize\n        according to manufacturer’s recommendation.\n        \nincubate at 20–25°C in the dark for 5 min.\nWash briefly in 1× PBS.\n        Using fine-tipped forceps, carefully remove coverslip from the well,\n        taking care not to flip the coverslip or scratch cells from surface of\n        the coverslip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2950-Fig1.jpg\n              Figure 1. Prepare fixed cells for imaging\n            \n(A) Remove coverslip with fixed cells from a 24 well plate.\n              (B) Coverslip with fixed cells facing up (red arrow) placed on\n              microscope slide with spacers consisting of 2 strips of parafilm\n              used to prevent cells from being flattened.\n            \n              (C) Add one drop of mounting media (red arrow) to the middle of\n              the round coverslip containing fixed cells.\n            \n(D) Cover with a 22 mm × 22 mm glass coverslip #1.5.\n              (E) Seal all four edges of the square coverslip with nail polish.",
    "(F) Slide is completely sealed with nail polish and ready for\n              imaging.\n            \n        Mount coverslip onto a precleaned microscope slide with cells facing up\n        between two thin strips of pre-cut parafilm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\n      \nNote: Slides may be cleaned with a Kimwipe\n      and 100% Ethanol to remove dust or lint prior to mounting.\n    \nNote: The two parafilm strips act as\n      spacers to avoid pressing cells and damaging cell morphology.\n    \n      The parafilm strips (approx. 2 mm × 15 mm) should be cut and placed on the\n      microscope slide prior to placing coverslip to avoid drying out the cells.\n      Take care to place the strips apart far enough to fit a 13 mm round\n      coverslip, but still within the range of cover by the square coverslip\n      (22 mm wide) that is to be mounted on top.\n    \n        Add 1 drop (approx. 25 μL) of mounting media and cover the cells with\n        22 mm × 22 mm glass coverslip #1.5, allowing the media to cover the\n        cells while avoiding bubbles (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D).\n      \n        Seal the edges of the glass coverslip with fingernail polish. Allow to\n        dry before imaging. (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\n      \nNote: In the presented protocol, special\n      consideration was given to the sample mounting (shown in\n      Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In the design/development of the sample\n      mounting part of our protocol, we had to consider the following: (1)\n      Optimal attachment of cardiomyocytes requires growth on plastic. To this\n      end, we have seeded cardiomyocytes on round Thermanox coverslips. So as\n      not to distort the light path with the plastic Thermanox coverslips, we\n      have used cover glass for mounting (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). (2) In\n      our experience, the use of spacers is necessary to limit the compression\n      of nuclei by the coverslips being pulled by capillary forces (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). (3) For highest possible resolution, we have used an oil-immersion\n      lens.",
    "Part 3: Confocal microscopy\nTiming: 45 - 60 m\n    \n      Part 3 of this protocol describes the procedure for imaging and\n      quantifying nuclear pores using high resolution microscopy.\n    \nNote: This protocol utilizes Nikon\n      equipment and software. Confocal microscopes from other manufacturers will\n      enable the same experiments with minimal modifications of this protocol.\n      We provide details of the hardware and terminology used, which should help\n      identify corresponding equipment from other vendors.\n    \n        Whole cell imaging.\n        \n            Place slide containing mounted cells onto the stage of the confocal\n            microscope. The slide should be placed so that the glass coverslip\n            is facing toward the objective. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2950-Fig2.jpg\n                  Figure 2. Cross-sectional diagram of sample mount\n                \n                  This protocol for heart muscle cells uses an inverted\n                  microscope with a Nikon 100× Plan Apo, Lambda, oil 0.13 mm\n                  working distance lens.\n                \n            Using the DAPI channel, locate cell nuclei under the 10× or 20×\n            objective lens.\n            \n                Switch to the Plan Apo Lambda 100× oil immersion objective lens.\n              \n                Add 1 drop of Immersion Oil Type B to the surface of the lens.\n              \n                Identify cells with smooth nuclear border by bringing the edge\n                of the nucleus into focus.\n                \nCritical: Only select\n                  cells with smooth nuclear border in interphase where the\n                  entire nuclear envelope can be seen as a disc. Cells\n                  undergoing mitosis should be avoided due to the breakdown of\n                  the nuclear envelope.\n                \n            Once a cell has been selected, set the pinhole size to 0.7AU.\n            \n                Set scanning format size to 1024 × 1024 pixel with a pixel dwell\n                time of 1.1 μsec.\n              \n                Press the SCAN button to begin scanning.\n                table:files/protocols_protocol_2950_7.csv\nNote: See Image Acquisition\n                  Parameters (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) for suggested\n                  settings.\n                \n            Adjust the laser power and gain at the optimal focal plane for each\n            subcellular structure (nucleus, nuclear pores, etc). Modify the\n            focus as needed.\n            \nCritical: Avoid oversaturation\n              (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).",
    "Note: Laser power and gain\n              settings for each channel may vary on different systems and with\n              individual users. The overall principal is to avoid over\n              oversaturation.\n            \nNote: Because it is important to\n              use the full dynamic range of the detector, it is recommended to\n              evaluate the Look Up Table (LUT) histogram for appropriate display\n              of low through high range of intensity (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\n            \n            Take an image of the cell of interest by selecting\n            CAPTURE.
