    "Periosteum harvest and cell isolation (the procedure can alternatively be completed using ovine periosteum, fresh from the butcher)Source periosteum explant tissue from human patients, e.g., following total joint replacement surgery (Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) approval 16/203) or from other source such as fresh ovine femora (Knothe Tate et al., 2011; Chang and Knothe Tate 2011 and 2012; Chang et al., 2014). Note: The PDC donor in this feasibility study was a 52-year-old female with osteoarthritis of the knee.  Lift periosteum off the underlying bone with a periosteal elevator and immediately transfer, double-bagged and on ice, to the laboratory. To transfer the tissue from hospital to laboratory, keep the explant tissue in a specimen jar and place the jar in a sealed transport box with ice packs. In tissue culture laboratory, isolate periosteum in a sterile environment inside the biosafety cabinet. Using periosteal elevator, lift periosteum off the underlying bone and immediately transfer the tissue pieces on to a 60 x 15 mm Petri dish.To isolate the PDCs (Figure 6), suspend the tissue on a Petri dish in 3 mg/ml Collagenase II (Gibco) solution in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) with GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) with 1% Antibiotic-antimycotic (AMAB) (Invitrogen) overnight per previous protocols (Knothe Tate et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2014).After 24 h, observe the presence and growth of cells around the tissue on the Petri dish under the microscope. PDCs appear fibroblastic in shape. Old medium can be replaced with fresh medium containing Collagenase II.When adequate cell growth is observed on the dish, wash cells with 3 ml 1x PBS. Then remove PBS and add 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Then incubate cells at 37 °C for 5 min.",
    "When cell detachment is observed, add 7 ml of standard culture medium (α-MEM with 1% AMAB and 10% FBS) and transfer the cell suspension to a 50 ml falcon tube.Place the tube in a centrifuge (e.g., Thermo Fischer HerausTM MultifugeTM centrifuge) and spin for 5 min at 300 x g.Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 ml of standard culture medium.To determine the cellularity of the tissue, take 10 µl of the cell suspension and mix with 10 µl 0.4% wt/vol trypan blue salt solution in a separate Eppendorf tube. Prepare a glass coverslip on a hemocytometer. Add about 10 µl of the mixture into a chamber on a hemocytometer. Under the microscope, count the viable cells present on the four quadrants of the chamber to get the number of cells present per ml of the cell suspension. Under an inverted microscope, count only viable cells that appear bright white. Dead cells appear blue as their membrane disrupted, allowing trypan blue staining to enter the cells.To remove the undigested tissue, filter the remaining cell suspension in falcon tube using a 100 µm cell strainer.Depending on the number of viable cells, transfer the eluted cells to a T75 culture flask for further expansion (e.g., if 1 x 106 viable cells are present, cell suspension can be divided into 2 or 3 T75 flasks). Maintain cells in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Replace medium every 2-3 days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191128/20191128020259_3613.jpgFigure 6. Schematic diagram outlining overview of protocol, part 2. A. Periosteum isolation from the knee tissue obtained from a patient undergoing knee replacement surgery. The knee tissue often has a small amount of bone proximal or distal to the knee, where periosteum can be isolated.",
    "The tissue piece can be placed on to Petri dish and suspended in 3 mg/ml Collagenase II containing medium to digest the tissue. Periosteum-derived cells (PDCs) growth can be observed after 24 h. B. The expanded PDCs are harvested and seeded on the Matrigel® in a glass-bottomed well of thickness 1 mm. At a pre-determined time point, cells are stained and migration through the gel can be visualized via confocal microscopy.Choice of a cell cohort controlValidated BMSCs, acquired from Lonza (Catalog number: PT 2501, lot no. 0000636886), serve as a comparative control. Note: Analogous to the cohort from a previously published study (Chang et al., 2014), the BMSCs were isolated from a 44-year-old male donor and were passaged twice prior to cryopreservation. Cell culture and cryopreservationCulture primary PDCs for a few days in a T75 flask until 80-90% confluent, then expand and passage them 1-2 times prior to use. Some of the PDCs with early passage number can be cryopreserved for future use.To passage cell, remove medium and wash cells with 1x PBS once. Then, remove PBS and add 3 ml 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Keep the flask in an incubator at 37 °C for 5 min until cell detachment is observed. Then, add 7 ml of standard culture medium to the flask and transfer the cell suspension to a 50 ml falcon tube.Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Then, remove the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 ml standard culture medium.For 1 in 10 dilution passage, transfer 1 ml of this suspension to a new T75 flask for further expansion, with an addition of 14 ml standard culture medium.To cryopreserve the cells, harvest cells as per protocol in Step 2, then centrifuge the suspension at 300 x g for 5 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in freezing medium (α-MEM with 40% FBS and 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]). A confluent T75 flask can be split into 3 cryovials, with each has a volume of 1 ml.Transfer 1 ml of the cell suspension in freezing medium into a cryovial and store at -80 °C overnight. Transfer cryovials to a liquid nitrogen tank at -196 °C for long term storage. Culture all cells in standard medium, and replace medium every 2-3 days. Perform experiments at passage 2 for PDCs after primary culture establishment and passage 2 for BMSCs after cryopreserved acquisition.Preparation of tissue template (Anlage) model using Extracellular-Matrix-based hydrogelPrepare Matrigel® at a concentration of 6 mg/ml through dilution with α-MEM, 20% FBS and 1% AMAB. Keep Matrigel® on ice or at a temperature below 10 °C during the preparation as it polymerizes at room temperature.Load 110 µl of the thus prepared Matrigel into the well of a glass-bottom dish (Cellvis, D35-10-0-N) to a thickness of 1.18 mm. To prepare BMSCs and PDCs for seeding, wash the cell culture twice each with 5 ml of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).Incubate cells for 5 min with 3 ml 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) and add 7 ml standard culture medium to harvest cells. Transfer the cell suspension to a falcon tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min.Resuspend pellet in 10 ml standard culture medium. Take 10 µl of this suspension and mix with 10 µl of 0.4% (wt/vol) trypan blue. Load 10 µl of this mixture into a chamber on a hemocytometer with coverslip. Count the cells on the four quadrants to get the cell number per ml.Adjust the cells' number by dilution.",
    "Seed 40,000 cells onto the Matrigel® in a glass-bottomed dish with 2 ml of FBS-reduced medium comprising α-MEM, 5% FBS, 1% AMAB. Keep the cells in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until predetermined time points designated for live imaging to assess cell migration (t = 3 and 7 days in our studies). Change medium every 2-3 days.Live cell stainingAt predetermined time points, carefully wash the Matrigel/cell culture twice with 1x PBS. Prepare a 2 mM stock solution of Calcein-AM (995 g/mole) (Sigma-Aldrich) by dissolving 1 mg of Calcein-AM in 0.5 ml DMSO. From this, make a staining solution by diluting 1 µl of Calcein-AM stock for every 1 ml α-MEM to give 2 µM staining solution. Stain the cells on Matrigel with 2 ml Calcein-AM solution and incubate in the dark for 30 min at 37 °C.Remove the staining solution and replace with 2 ml FBS-reduced medium. Maintain the stained culture in the dark at 37 °C prior to imaging.Fluorescent microscopy and data analysis for live imaging of cell motilityUsing fluorescent microscopy, track the respective cells' spatiotemporal migration behavior and dynamics. We used the Leica SP8 DLS confocal laser scanning microscope to image live PDC and BMSC migration using the 10x dry objective and 488 nm laser. Acquire Z-stacks of optical slices and process using ImageJ. Either reconstruct image stacks into 3D images using 3D Viewer Plugin to visualize the dynamics of migrating cells or compress them into a 2D image to observe cell behavior. Quantify cell migration distance by measuring the z-position of cells as they migrate from the top to the bottom of the 3D idealized tissue template model. We measured in random locations of the Matrigel (n = 6) at Days 3 and 7.",
    "Two-way ANOVA statistical analysis and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was performed with Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA), where data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) with a 99% confidence interval. Note: The measurement of cell migration distance takes advantage of the Leica SP8 confocal microscope which can capture images of 3D samples in x, y and z directions. This microscope also enables time-lapse imaging of 3D samples (xyzt mode), a feature that can be explored further to study temporal aspects of cell migration. To perform this, a more stable, permanent fluorophore should be used to label the cells, e.g., GFP expression construct.MTT (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide) Metabolic AssayRetrieve PDCs and BMSCs grown in culture at early passage (up to passage 6 or less). Alternatively, PDCs and BMSCs with early passage number can be retrieved from liquid nitrogen. These cells are thawed and grown in standard culture medium. After thawing, the cells are passaged 1-2 times prior to use for experiment.PDCs and BMSCs are washed with PBS and trypsinized with 3 ml 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. After cell detachment is observed, 7 ml of standard culture medium is added and cell suspension is transferred to a Falcon tube.Centrifuge the suspension at 1500 rpm or 300 x g for 5 min. Then, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml standard culture medium. Take 10 µl of the cell suspension and mix with 10 µl of trypan blue for cell counting using a hemocytometer.Cell number in the suspension is adjusted for seeding into a 24-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells per well (5,000 cells/cm2), with a volume of 1 ml per well.",
    "Prior to seeding, prepare Matrigel® at a concentration of 6 mg/ml by diluting with standard culture medium containing 10% FBS and 1% AMAB. Then, add 300 µl of the prepared Matrigel to each well to coat the wells of 24-well plate. After the gel coat has polymerized at room temperature, seed PDCs and BMSCs in each well at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 (n = 4). Keep cells in well plate in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Retrieve the 3D cell culture on Day 3 and Day 6 after seeding for MTT assay. Prepare MTT stock solution by diluting 5 mg MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) in 5 ml 1x PBS. Dilute 1 ml of this stock solution in 8 ml medium (1:8). Remove the medium in the well plate and wash the cells with 1x PBS. Add 300 µl of MTT solution to each well and incubate the cells in the dark at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, purple formazan can be observed which is the result of metabolized MTT by the cells’ mitochondrial dehydrogenase. Remove the MTT solution from the wells and solubilize the coating gel containing the purple formazan in DMSO (300 µl per well). Then transfer the content in a well to an Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 1500 rpm or 300 x g to separate gel and liquid layer. Discard the liquid DMSO layer and solubilize the gel again with DMSO.Centrifuge at 300 x g to solubilize the formazan in the gel, whereby the gel becomes a pellet.Transfer the upper liquid layer containing formazan to a well plate and read the absorbance using a plate reader (Perkin Elmer Victor 3, 570 nm filter)."
