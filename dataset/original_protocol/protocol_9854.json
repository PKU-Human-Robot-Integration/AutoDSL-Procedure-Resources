    "A schematic of the overall process is provided in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of buffers\nNOTE: Sterile filtering of the buffers is highly suggested here to remove any particulates which may impact the nucleic acid and LNP quality.\nPhosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)\n\t\nPrepare 1x PBS using 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl in nuclease free water and adjust the pH to 7.4.\nSterilize by vacuum filtration using a 0.22 µm pore-size filter.\nCitrate Buffer\n\t\nPrepare citrate buffer using 5 mM sodium citrate, 5 mM citric acid, and 150 mM sodium chloride in nuclease free water and adjust to pH 4.5.\nSterilize by vacuum filtration using a 0.22 µm pore-size filter.\n\t\t​NOTE: Citrate buffer only needs to be prepared if mRNA is the nucleic acid that will be encapsulated in the LNP. If DNA will be encapsulated skip 1.2 and proceed to 1.3.\nMalic Acid Buffer\n\t\nPrepare malic acid buffer using 20 mM malic acid and 30 mM sodium chloride in nuclease free water and adjust to pH 3.0.\nSterilize by vacuum filtration using a 0.22 µm pore-size filter.\n\t\t​NOTE: Malic acid buffer only needs to be prepared if DNA is the nucleic acid that will be encapsulated in the LNP. Skip 1.3 if mRNA is to be encapsulated. Citrate buffer is used for mRNA encapsulation, as the lower pH of 3.0 with malic acid buffer may lead to an increased likelihood of mRNA degradation. The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Preparation of lipid mix\nIf stock lipids are in powder form, solubilize in pure 200 proof ethanol.",
    "Calculate the required mix of lipid components based on the desired molar ratio. A molar ratio of 50:10:39:1 (ionizable lipid:helper lipid:cholesterol:PEG) will be used here as an example for a total lipid concentration of 10 mM. Table 1 shows the concentrations and volumes needed for each of these components.\n\tNOTE: When calculating the volume needed to achieve the lipid mix concentration in ethanol (EtOH) for the microfluidic mixer, the total volume is accounted for to ensure that the addition of EtOH does not influence the lipid concentrations. For example, an ionizable lipid volume of 68.5 µL is calculated by multiplying the 5 mM concentration in ethanol by a total lipid mix volume of 533 µL and then dividing by the stock lipid concentration of 38.9 mM.\nAdd the appropriate amount of each lipid stock solution to a glass vial to allow components to mix with intermittent vortexing. Add 200 proof ethanol for a total mixture of 533 µL. For the example in Table 1, this is 254 µL of ethanol.\n\t​NOTE: For a single run to produce 1 mL of LNPs, 342.5 µL of lipid solution is needed. This is due to a 3:1 mix of aqueous nucleic acid to organic lipid solution with some volume discarded before and after sample collection. A mix of 533 µL is made to compensate as overage.\n3. Preparation of nucleic acid solution\nNOTE: Preparation and handling of nucleic acid solutions is to be performed in a sterile and RNase-free environment wherever possible. Work in a biosafety cabinet whenever possible with the nucleic acid.",
    "Calculate N/P ratio. The N/P ratio is the total number of ionizable lipid amine groups (N) to the total number of negatively charged nucleic acid phosphate groups (P). N/P ratio is often a parameter that can be optimized during LNP formation. Follow the steps below.\n\t\nCalculate the number of N units using the below formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62226/62226eq01.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: The ionizable lipid concentration (Table 1) is 5 mM, which is equivalent to 5 x 10-6 mol/mL. The required lipid injection volume is 0.3425 mL. For example, if the number of N units per molecule is 1, using the above equation, there are 1.03 x 1018 N units in the lipid mix.\nCalculate the P units for the desired N/P ratio. Here an N/P = 36 is used for example.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62226/62226eq02.jpg\nCalculate the necessary nucleic acid concentration to obtain 2.86 x 1016 P units using the below equation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62226/62226eq03.jpg\n\tWhere, the number of P units per base pair for mRNA is 1 and DNA is 2. For an mRNA with 1,200 bases, the amount of mRNA required for a N/P = 36 is 3.96 x 10-11 moles.\nCalculate the mass concentration of mRNA required for N/P = 36 using the below equation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62226/62226eq04.jpg\n\tThe average molecular weight of a ribonucleotide monophosphate unit is 322 g/mol30. With 1,200-base mRNA, the molecular weight of the mRNA is 386,400 g/mol. The required injection volume of nucleic acid solution is 1.028 mL. Thus, the concentration of mRNA needed is 1.488x10-5 g/mL, which is 14.88 µg/mL.\nMake up 1.5 mL of 14.88 µg/mL of mRNA in citrate buffer.\n\t​NOTE: When DNA will be the nucleic acid encapsulated, use malic acid buffer to make up the nucleic acid solution.\n4. Priming the microfluidic channels\nNOTE: This protocol is adapted from the instrument manufacturer's guidelines.",
    "Input the priming parameters into the instrument software by clicking on the appropriate fields (Table 2).\n\tNOTE: A flow ratio of 3:1 and flow rate of 4-12 mL/min is recommended27,31 . This has been shown to be optimal in the studies presented here, as well as by the manufacturer. This can be varied if it is of interest towards the application.\nOpen the instrument lid and place a microfluidic cartridge into the rotating block.\nDraw at least 0.5 mL of ethanol into a 1 mL syringe, ensuring there are no bubbles or air gaps at the syringe tip. Load this syringe into the right inlet of the cartridge.\nFill a 3 mL syringe with 1.5 mL of aqueous buffer (citrate for RNA and malic acid for DNA), ensuring there are no air bubbles or gaps. Load this syringe into the left inlet of the cartridge.\nInsert two 15 mL conical tubes in the clip holders to serve as waste containers.\nClick on Run in the instrument software to begin the mixing, ensuring that the parameters are input correctly.\nWhen the instrument stops priming, indicated by the bottom blue light shutting off, open the lid and properly dispose of the conical tubes and syringes.\n5. LNP formation\nNOTE: This protocol is adapted from the instrument manufacturer's guidelines.\nUpdate the software with the formulation parameters by clicking on the appropriate fields (Table 2).\nFill a 1 mL syringe with the lipid mix (prepared in step 2). Remove any air gaps or bubbles at the syringe tip and insert the syringe into the right side of the cartridge.",
    "Draw the nucleic acid solution (prepared in step 3) into a 3 mL syringe, ensuring there are no bubbles or air gaps in the syringe tip. Insert the syringe into the left inlet of the cartridge.\n\tNOTE: Volumes are provided to make a 1 mL solution of LNPs. This instrument can incorporate syringe sizes up to 10 mL, and volumes can be scaled accordingly with no influence on the outcome. The maximum volume of LNPs that can be prepared in one preparation is 12 mL.\nLabel a 15 mL RNase-free conical tube with the sample name and insert into the left tube clip. Place a 15 mL waste conical in the right tube clip.\nClose the instrument lid and click Run, after confirming correct input of parameters.\nAfter the instrument is finished running, properly discard the waste container and cartridge. Retain the conical tube with the LNP sample.\nDilute the LNP 5x with PBS to minimize the ethanol to <5% (v/v).\n\t​NOTE: It is important to dilute the LNPs in PBS as soon as possible after microfluidic mixing to prevent degradation. Always perform the dilution in a biosafety cabinet and continuing to work in the biosafety cabinet throughout the buffer exchanges.\n6. Buffer exchange\nNOTE: Protocol for using ultra-centrifuge filters is provided. While this method results in a more time efficient exchange of buffers, dialysis may be substituted here.\nPre-wash an ultra-centrifuge filter (100 kDa pore size) with 2 mL of PBS by centrifuging at 1000 x g for 5 min. Empty the PBS from the bottom compartment.\n\tNOTE: PBS is chosen to increase the pH to 7.4 ± 0.2, which is physiologically relevant and will result in the ionizable lipid having a neutral charge.",
    "Add diluted LNPs to the top compartment of the pre-washed ultra-centrifuge filter and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 12 min.\nDiscard the flow-through from the bottom compartment. Perform two more washes by adding 5 mL of PBS to the ultra-centrifuge filter each time. Centrifuge at the same parameters. There is no maximum volume that needs to be maintained.\n\tNOTE: If a scaled-up volume of LNPs were prepared, increase the volume of PBS for each wash accordingly. For example, if 2 mL of LNPs were prepared in a single run, then 10 mL PBS per wash is suggested.\nPipette the LNP solution against the walls of the ultra-centrifuge filter a few times to minimize LNP loss. Remove the LNP solution from the ultra-centrifuge filter and store in a nuclease free vial. Add PBS if needed to achieve a final volume of the LNP solution of 1 mL.\nFilter through a pre-wet 0.2 µm syringe filter, if needed.\n\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n7. Measure encapsulation efficiency\nPrepare a standard curve by making 2-fold serial dilutions of working nucleic acid solution in PBS, starting with a highest concentration of 500 ng/mL, and making at least five dilutions. Use PBS as a blank.\nPrepare the LNP sample dilutions. Dilute LNP samples with PBS, to achieve an approximate theoretical concentration that lies around the mid-point of the standard curve (eg. ~ 250 ng/mL of nucleic acid estimated from the initial concentration).\nPrepare a solution of the RNA quantification reagent (for mRNA measurements) with TritonX-100 to disrupt the LNPs and measure the total amount of nucleic acid inside and outside of the LNP. This solution contains 0.5% (v/v) RNA reagent, 0.4% (v/v) TritonX-100, and 99.1% (v/v) PBS.",
    "Prepare a solution of the reagent without TritonX-100 to measure the amount of nucleic acid not encapsulated in the LNPs. This solution contains 0.5% (v/v) RNA reagent and 99.5% (v/v) PBS.\n\tNOTE: If LNPs encapsulate double stranded DNA (dsDNA), such as plasmid DNA, use the dsDNA reagent in 7.3 and 7.4 instead, following the same procedure.\nIn a 96-well black fluorescence capable plate, load at least four replicates of each of the LNP and nucleic acid standard solutions prepared in 7.1 and 7.2.\nTo half of the replicates of standards and samples, add an equal volume of the reagent containing TritonX-100. This will quantify the total amount of nucleic acid.\nTo the remaining wells of standards and samples, add an equal volume of the reagent without TritonX-100. This will quantify the amount of nucleic acid not encapsulated inside the LNP.\nShake the plate for 5 min at room temperature to ensure thorough mixing of standards and samples with the added reagent, taking precautions to avoid light exposure.\nMeasure the fluorescence using a microplate reader, with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm.\nCalculate the concentration of nucleic acid outside of the LNP using the standard curve made with the addition of the reagent without TritonX-100. Multiply by the dilution factor used in 7.2.\nCalculate the concentration of nucleic acid both inside and outside of the LNP using the standard curve made with the addition of the reagent containing TritonX-100. Multiply by the dilution factor used in 7.2.\nCalculate the concentration of nucleic acid inside by subtracting the concentration of nucleic acid outside (calculated from step 7.10) from the total concentration of nucleic acid both inside and outside (calculated from step 7.11)",
    "Quantify the encapsulation efficiency from the ratio of the concentration of nucleic acid inside the LNP (calculated from step 7.12) and the total concentration of nucleic acid (calculated from step 7.11).\n\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n8. Concentration adjustments\nIf needed, adjust the nucleic acid concentration within the LNP solution using the results from the encapsulation efficiency.\nIf a less concentrated solution is desired, dilute the solution with PBS to achieve the desired concentration.\nIf a more concentrated solution is desired, perform additional centrifugation runs using an ultra-centrifuge filter.\n\t​NOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n9. Measure LNP hydrodynamic size and polydispersity\nDilute an aliquot of the LNP solution 40x with PBS to obtain a final volume of 1 mL.\n\tNOTE: This dilution may be changed if required. This dilution value is suggested as it uses a small volume of the LNP stock solution while providing quality results.\nUsing a semi-micro cuvette, measure the hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index. Add the LNP solution into the cuvette and insert into the instrument. Set up an operating procedure in the instrument software to include the measurement type, sample details (material, dispersant, temperature, and cell type), and measurement instructions (number of runs). Click Start when ready to begin the measurement acquisition.\n10. Measure LNP zeta potential\nDilute an aliquot of the LNP solution 40x with nuclease free water to obtain a final volume of 1 mL.\n\t​NOTE: Nuclease free water is used as the solvent for zeta potential measurements to minimize the influence of high salt buffers on conductivity.\nUsing a folded capillary zeta cell, measure the zeta potential.\n\t\nAdd the LNP solution into the cuvette up to the fill line. Insert into the instrument ensuring that the electrodes are making contact with the instrument.",
