    "AB wild-type zebrafish and transgenic zebrafish lines elavl3:mCherry, ETvmat2:GFP, and mpo:EGFP were obtained from the Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences (ICMS). Ethical approval (UMARE-030-2017) for the animal experiments was granted by the Animal Research Ethics Committee, University of Macau, and the protocol follows the institutional animal care guidelines.\n1. Zebrafish embryo and larval husbandry\nGenerate zebrafish embryos (200-300 embryos per mating) by natural pairwise mating as previously reported28.\nPrepare egg water (E3) medium stock (60×) by dissolving 34.8 g of NaCl, 1.6 g of KCl, 5.8 g of CaCl2·2H2O, and 9.78 g of MgCl2·6H2O in ddH2O to a final volume of 2 L and adjust pH to 7.2 using NaOH and HCl. To prepare working concentration of E3 medium (1×), dilute the stock 60 times in ddH2O. Store at 28.5 °C when not in use.\nUse a plastic transfer pipette to transfer the zebrafish embryos to a dish containing E3 medium. Raise the embryos at 28.5 °C in an incubator and monitor their development and health. Remove dead embryos and replace unclean E3 medium with fresh medium daily.\nFor zebrafish imaging experiments, use a plastic transfer pipette to collect 0-2 h post fertilization (hpf) embryos (around 200 eggs) in approximately 15 mL of 1× E3 medium containing 0.003% N-phenylthiourea (PTU).\n\tNOTE: PTU can inhibit the formation of melanophores during embryogenesis29. Treatment of embryos with PTU during embryogenesis can improve signal detection in microscopy or expression of fluorescence30.\nMaintain the zebrafish embryos under the above conditions until embryos reach the desired developmental larval stage.\n2. Preparing for microinjection\nPrepare for the injection by pulling glass capillaries using a micropipette puller (see Table of Materials), following the five step protocol for glass capillary tube pulling (Table 1).",
    "Open the tip of needle (thin wall glass capillaries [3.5 in] with filament, OD 1.14 mm) to the appropriate size at an angle using forceps (Figure 2A).\nFill the needle with 0.1 mL of mineral oil to ensure that there are no bubbles.\nRemove the screw cap of the steel needle of the microinjection apparatus. Align the glass needle hole with the steel needle and then tighten the screw cap. Mount the loaded needle microinjection apparatus in a micromanipulator (see Table of Materials).\nAdjust the position of the microinjection apparatus so that the micromanipulator can flexibly move the apparatus under the microscope. Discharge a certain volume of paraffin oil to make the steel needle enter the capillary glass tube.\nDrop the injection solution (such as 1× PBS or 5 mg/mL LPS) on a glass slide sterilized with 70% ethanol and adjust the microinjection apparatus so that the tip is inserted into the liquid drop. Load ~2 µL of injection solution into the needle.\nSet up the micromanipulator (fine adjustment settings of up, down, left, and right) so that the needle tip of the microinjection apparatus is in the same field of vision as the larvae on high magnification (Figure 2B).\n3. Mounting zebrafish for microinjections\nNOTE: Zebrafish brain development occurs within 3 dpf and matures at 5 dpf with a well-developed central nervous system31,32. Therefore, 5 dpf larvae are already suitable for studying LPS-mediated neuronal damage as well as behavioral and inflammatory responses.\nInject the zebrafish larvae within approximately 30 min of reaching the stage of interest, to maintain the consistency of injection timing.\nTo anesthetize the zebrafish larvae, combine tricaine with clean fish tank water (final concentration of 0.02% w/v tricaine).",
    "Melt a solution of 2% agarose in ddH2O using a microwave. Pour the molten agarose into a plastic dish. The 2% agarose-coated plastic dish can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nUse a plastic transfer pipette to transport anesthetized larvae to the center of the 2% agarose-coated plastic dish. Orient the mounted larvae with the brain side up for needle access.\n4. Injecting the brain ventricle\nAdjust the magnification of the microscope so that the brain ventricular structure of zebrafish is clearly displayed in the field of vision (Figure 2B).\nPlace the needle carefully above the brain tectum (Figure 2C).\nPuncture the skin of the zebrafish brain with the needle tip slowly using the micromanipulator.\nPress the foot pedal to eject 1 nL of 1x PBS or different concentrations of LPS (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/mL) (see Table of Materials). Successful ventricle injection images at which brain ventricle was injected with 1 nL of 1% Evans blue dye (diluted in PBS) are shown as an example (Figure 2D). Transfer the larvae to clean E3 medium immediately after the injection. After 24 h, collect the larvae for microscopic imaging, locomotive behavioral assay, and determination of other indicators.\n5. Imaging\nPrepare 1.5% low-melt agarose solution in E3 medium and heat it in a microwave to form a clear liquid.\nUse a clean plastic transfer pipette to transport the larvae to a glass slide and remove as much water as possible.\nUse a plastic transfer pipette to add a drop of 1.5% low-melt agarose to the larvae.\n\tNOTE: Cool the low-melt agarose in the pipette for a while before adding so as not to injure the larvae.\nUse a 1 mL syringe needle to orient the larvae. Wait until the agarose cools down and solidifies before starting imaging.",
    "Observe and photograph the neuron region in the whole brain of Tg(ETvmat2:EGFP) and Tg(elavl3:mCherry) zebrafish, as well as the recruitment of neutrophils in the Tg(mpo:EGFP) zebrafish brain under a fluorescence stereo microscope (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Fluorescence microscope settings used for imaging are shown below. Tg(ETvmat2:EGFP) zebrafish brain (excitation wavelength: 450-490 nm, emission wavelength: 500-550 nm, visual magnification: 100x); Tg(elavl3:mCherry) zebrafish brain (excitation wavelength: 541-551 nm, emission wavelength: 590 nm, visual magnification: 100x); Tg(mpo:EFGP) zebrafish brain (excitation wavelength: 450-490 nm, emission wavelength: 500-550 nm, visual magnification: 63x).\nMeasure and analyze the fluorescence intensity and length of the Ra neuron region in Tg(ETvmat2:EGFP) zebrafish and the fluorescence intensity of Tg(elavl3:mCherry) zebrafish brain neurons using ImageJ software. Manually count the neutrophils in the brain region of Tg(mpo:EFGP) zebrafish.\n6. Determination of gene expression markers\nAt 24 h after LPS brain ventricular injection, proceed with the determination of gene expression markers. To do so, anesthetize zebrafish larvae with 0.02% tricaine (as mentioned in step 3.2).\nUse two 1 mL syringes to separate the head portions of the larvae (40 larvae per group) without the eye and yolk sac regions (Figure 2E).\nExtract RNA from the larval head portions.\n\t\nFor RNA extraction, homogenize the head portion with 200 µL of RNA extraction reagent (see Table of Materials) using a tissue grinder (see Table of Materials) at a rotation speed of 11,000 rpm for 5 s.\nPerform RNA extraction using the chloroform-isopropanol method. To do so, add 40 µL chloroform, shake the tubes vigorously, and incubate them at room temperature for 10 min. Centrifuge the samples at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.",
    "Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube (about 100 µL) and add 100 µL of isopropanol. Incubate for 10 min and then centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant.\nAdd 200 µL of 75% ethanol to wash the RNA pellet. Vortex the samples briefly and then centrifuge at 7500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet again.\nAir dry the RNA pellet for 5-10 min, then add 30 µL of RNase-free water to dissolve the RNA pellet. Check the purity (ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm) and integrity of RNA using a microvolume spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials).\nSynthesize cDNA from the RNA extracted in step 6.3, using reverse transcriptase with random primers (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nAdd 1 µL of random primers, 1 µL of dNTPs, 1 µg of RNA, and distilled water (total volume to 12 µL) to a nuclease-free tube. Heat the mixture to 65 °C for 5 min and quick chill on ice.\nAdd 1 µL of 0.1 M DTT, 1 µL of RNase inhibitor, 4 µL of 5× first-strand buffer, and 1 µL of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (total volume: 20 µL) to the tube. Mix gently and incubate the tube at 25 °C for 2 min, followed by 42 °C for 50 min. Inactivate the reaction by heating at 70 °C for 15 min.",
    "Perform real time PCR on a qPCR System (see Table of Materials) using a commercially available RT-qPCR kit (see Table of Materials) to determine the expression of the target genes(IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). The reaction mixture (20 µL) contained 10 µL of SYBR green, 0.4 µL of ROX reference dye, 0.8 µL each of the forward and reverse primers, 6 µL of ddH2O, and 2 µL of template cDNA (1 µg). Perform PCR amplification under the conditions: 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 34 s, and with a dissociation stage of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 95 °C for 15 s.\nNormalize the mRNA levels of the target genes to that of a housekeeping gene, elongation factor 1 α (Ef1α). Calculate the expression levels for each target gene by the 2−ΔΔCT method33. The primer sequences of each gene are described in Table 2.\nFor the determination of nitric oxide, homogenize the head portion (obtained in step 6.2) in 100 µL of cold PBS using a tissue grinder. Centrifuge the resultant PBS and head portion suspension at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Collect the lysates and perform nitrite concentration assay34 using a commercially available kit (see Table of Materials).\n7. Zebrafish locomotive behavioral assay\nAt 24 h after LPS brain ventricular injection, transfer the zebrafish larvae to the wells of a 96-well square microplate individually. Add 300 µL of E3 medium to each well and then incubate the larvae for 4 h to acclimate to the testing plate.",
    "Transfer the larvae-loaded microplate to the zebrafish tracking box (see Table of Materials). Turn on the light source and then incubate the larvae in the testing box for 30 min to acclimate the environment.\nMonitor and record the zebrafish behavior using an automated video tracking system. Record 12 sessions (5 min each, total 1 h) for each zebrafish. Define the total distance (consists of inactive, small, and large distances) as the distance (in mm) that each fish moved during a 60 min tracking period.\n8. Statistical analysis\nPerform statistical analyses using standard analysis software (see Table of Materials).\nPerform statistical analysis of differences between two groups using ordinary one-way ANOVA. Calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient to assess the strength of correlations. P < 0.05 was considered significant in all analyses.\nSubscription Required.
