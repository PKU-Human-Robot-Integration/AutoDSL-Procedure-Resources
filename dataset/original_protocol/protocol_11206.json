    "1. Cell culture and tumorsphere formation\nCulture HT29 cells in a 10 cm dish containing Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic (P/S).\nGrow the cells in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity under aseptic conditions, until they reach 80% confluency.\nTrypsinize HT29 cells with 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C and consequently neutralize the trypsin by adding 2 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% P/S.\nCount the HT29 cells using a hemocytometer.\nAdd 2,000 cells/well to a low attached 6 well plates with 2 mL of serum-free DMEM with 1% P/S and supplemented with 0.2% B27, 20 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor (EGF), 20 ng/mL of fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 20 ng/mL of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and 20 ng/mL of interleukin 6 (IL6).\nGrow the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity under aseptic conditions.\nAdd 0.5 mL of cancer stem cell medium every 2 days until the tumorspheres measure >100 μm in diameter for at least 7 days.\nObserve and measure the tumorsphere diameter using an inverted microscope with a digital cell imaging system.\nWhen the tumorspheres reach >100 μm in diameter, trypsinize the tumorspheres with 0.25% trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C and neutralize the trypsin by adding 2x the volume of growth medium. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge at 1,200 rpm for 10 min and remove the supernatant.\nIncubate 5 x 104 cells with 2 µL of anti-LGR5-PE and 2 µL of anti-CD133-PE in 100 µL of DMEM individually for 30 min at room temperature, shaking at 200 rpm.\n\tNOTE: CD133 is a general cancer stem cell biomarker that is highly expressed in HT29 cells.",
    "Add 900 µL of PBS and analyze the LGR5 and CD133 expression using flow cytometry. A change in fluorescence in the FL2-H channel indicates gene expression.\n2. RNA isolation\nNOTE: Use a commercial kit (see Table of Materials) with a rapid column for RNA isolation following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nAdd 50 µL of PBS to the harvested cells (2 x 105 cells) and resuspend them with pipetting.\nAdd 200 µL of lysis buffer containing 2 µL of beta-mercaptoethanol (β-ME). Vortex quickly and let stand for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the solution at 16,000 x g for 10 min. Collect the supernatant and mix with 200 µL of 70% ethanol.\nUse the attached column to remove the solvent by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 1 min.\nWash using wash solution 1 and 2 to completely remove non-RNAs by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 1 min.\nCentrifuge again at 14,000 x g for 2 min to remove residual ethanol.\nAdd 50 µL of distilled water, centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 1 min, and collect the solution.\nMeasure the RNA concentration using OD260 with a spectrophotometer.\n\tRNA concentration (µg/mL) = (OD260) x (40 µg RNA/mL) and OD260/OD280 > 2. RNA samples should have an RNA integrity number (RIN) > 7.\n3. RNAseq profiling and bioinformatics analysis\nNOTE: RNAseq analysis was performed commercially (see Table of Materials) to investigate the differential genes in the HT29-derived tumorspheres compared to parental HT29 cells.\nUse commercial services for RNAseq steps, including library construction, library quality control, and DNA sequencing.",
    "The data report should contain important information, including the read counts, log2 fold change, and p value. Select the differential genes according to the following parameters: genes with a > 1 log2 fold change with read counts >100 in the HT29 tumorsphere group, and genes <-1 log2 fold change with read count >100 in the HT29 parental group. In this case, a p value < 0.05 was considered acceptable and the data were used (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: Here, a gene count >100 was used as the threshold to continue the study of a particular gene and validate its expression.\nUse statistical analysis software (see Table of Materials), to show a heatmap and identify overexpressed genes >1 and downregulated genes < 1 in log2 fold change.\nUse R software to draw the Volcano Plot with x: log2 fold change; y: -log10 (p value) to show the differential genes.\n\t\nInstall R library\n\t\tinstall.packages(library(calibrate)) \nRead the data in RStudio with the following program:\n\t\tres <-read.csv(\"/Users/xxx.csv\", header=T)\n\t\thead(res)\n\t\twith(res, plot(log2FoldChange, -log10(pvalue), pch=19, main=\"HT29CSC vs HT29\", xlim=c(-6,6), col=\"#C0C0C0\"))\n\t\twith(subset(res, pvalue<.05 & log2FoldChange>1), points(log2FoldChange, -log10(pvalue), pch=19, col=\"red\"))\n\t\twith(subset(res, pvalue<.05 & log2FoldChange<(-1)), points(log2FoldChange, -log10(pvalue), pch=19, col=\"blue\"))\n\t\twith(subset(res, pvalue>.05), points(log2FoldChange, -log10(pvalue), pch=19, col=\"#444444\"))\n\t\tabline(h=1.3, lty=2)\n\t\tabline(v=1, lty=2)\n\t\tabline(v=(-1), lty=2)\nExecute the run to obtain the Volcano Plot.\n4. Driver gene selection\nSelect Single gene Input in NetworkAnalyst.\nCopy and paste the selected overexpressed genes from Table 1 with “human” specified as the organism and ID type Official Gene Symbol.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, use Ensembl Gene ID for copy and paste.\nInsert the data by clicking Upload and Proceed to analyze it using protein-protein interaction (PPI) following genetic PPI.",
    "Use the STRING interactome database with a confidence score cutoff of 900 to show the seed genes cross-linking the uploaded genes. The seed genes associating with more individual genes were selected as driver genes that may be involved in maintaining formation of HT29-derived tumorspheres.\n\tNOTE: There are three interactome datasets for use: IMEx, STRING, and Rolland. STRING contains higher confidence experimental evidence. With lower uploaded gene numbers, IMEx can be selected to predict and pick up the driver genes in the interactome networks.\nSelect Proceed in the mapping overview.\nSelect White in the Background and Force Atlas in the Layout knob.\nSelect PANTHER BP to analyze the upregulation gene group.\n\tNOTE: This shows that HSPA5 was responsible for anti-apoptosis in the HT29-derived tumorspheres in this study (Figure 3A). To narrow down the specific functional field, KEGG, GO, or PANTHER classification can be used alternatively to select the specific driver genes.\nSubscription Required.
