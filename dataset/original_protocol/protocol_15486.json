    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the institutional human research ethics committee of the University of North Carolina, as it was created secondary to a literature review and did not require real human subjects. Required permissions from volunteers and for filming have been obtained. The representative RS-MRI images used in this study have been deidentified.\nNOTE: A review of the literature was conducted using keywords like \"rapid MRI\" and \"fast brain\". A total of 15 articles were reviewed, and the imaging protocols were retrieved and combined to create the protocol below.\n1. Patient positioning\nBefore patient positioning, ensure that a thorough review of contraindications to the use of MRI has been completed. Tell the patient that contraindications for RS-MRI currently include various types of metallic implants such as vascular clips, foreign bodies, prosthetic heart valves, and other types of metal devices. Scan the patient with a metal detector to ensure no loose metal objects.\nPatients who have anxiety or claustrophobia may need special attention to patient positioning to reduce exacerbations of these conditions. Give patients an alarm bell with an explanation for its use.\n\t\nConsult members of the Child Life Specialist team. Request that they review videos with patients to prepare them for what to expect.\nSome RS-MRI coils have mirrors. Fix them so the patient may see out of the MRI scanner. Ensure accurate patient positioning is practiced in pediatric patients and proper coils are chosen to optimize the RS-MRI images.\nCranial imaging\n\t\nFor a brain MRI, position the patient supine and centered on the brain coil with the chin tilted upwards3. Use landmarking, touch sensors, or laser marking with the patient's eyes closed.\nProvide earplugs for patient comfort and safety and immobilization pads to decrease motion and noise.\nSpine imaging\n\t\nCervical spine",
    "Place the patient in the supine position, with the larynx aligned to the center of the brain coil3. Use the same patient safety measures applied above.\nThoracic spine\n\t\t\nPlace the patient in the supine position. Utilize a spine coil and the center of the spine coil to align with the sternum3.\nLumbar spine\n\t\t\nPosition the patient in the supine position. Use the spine coil and align it centrally about 5 cm superior to the iliac bones3. Use an upright MRI if there is difficulty obtaining the image4.\nComforting techniques\n\t\nUse comforting techniques to reduce motion artifacts during RS-MRI. Attempt comforting techniques, including feeding, swaddling, and standard restraints5.\nRequest guardian involvement to assist with soothing techniques. If a guardian is unavailable, involve experienced staff members like Child Life Specialists to attempt soothing techniques.\nAlways attempt conservative soothing methods before the escalation of care. If standard restraints are required, do a thorough skin check after removal to assess for bruising.\nSedation\n\t\nIf the patient continues to remain inconsolable despite soothing techniques, consult anesthesiology for sedation recommendations and dosing. Obtain guardian consent with an escalation in care.\n2. Spine evaluation\nThe following RS-MRI protocol recommendations capture sequences for the routine detection and evaluation of spinal pathologies. Perform these sequences using a 1.5 Tesla (T) or 3T scanner6.\n\t\nReview representative parameters such as matrix size, field of view (FoV), repetition time (TR), and echo time (TE). Follow institution parameters or the parameters listed below.\nAdjust the full spine series field of view to single or separate (cervical-upper thoracic, lower thoracic-lumbar/sacral). Calculate adjustments based on the patient's body habitus.\nSyrinx evaluation\n\t\nUsing the NUMARIS/4 software, select the Patient tab in the top left corner. From the drop-down menu, select Patient Browser.",
    "A separate screen will display a list of options. From this list, select Scheduler. Click once on the patient's name, followed by the register button in the lower half of the screen.\nA separate screen will display the patient's Name, Date of Birth, Height, and Weight. Review these parameters to ensure they are correct.\nUnder patient positioning, select Head First- Supine. On the same screen, under Study, select SYRINX/TETHERED CORD NON-SEDATION EVALUATION protocol.\nAt the start of the imaging study, ensure the localizer sequence is running. This sequence determines the orientation of the study. Run this sequence 2-3 times in spine cases.\nNext, run the selected T2 weighted half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) axial and sagittal sequences.\n\t\t\nFollow the imaging protocol listed here: slice thickness 3.0 mm, FoV 240 mm, TE 82 ms, TR 1500 ms.\nAfter the study, repeat step 2.3.1. From the separate screen display, select Local Database.\nSelect the patient's name and the study completed. Click Transfer at the top left corner, followed by Transfer to PACS.\nNotify the support team that the study is concluded and transfer the patient out of the MRI scanner room. Once the patient is safely removed, reunite the patient with a guardian.\nOther spinal pathologies\n\t\nIf a clinical indication or suspicion of a cord pathology, Add a T2 Short-Ti Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequence. Include this sequence in the protocol above by repeating step 2.3.1.\nSelect ______- SPINE WO sequence. Select the sequence relevant to the portion of the spine that is being imaged (i.e., C-SPINE WO).\nFrom the list of additional sequences that populate in the right column, select the STIR sequence. Follow these protocol parameters: slick thickness 3.0 mm, FoV 280 mm, TE 58.0 ms, TR 4000 ms.",
    "Of note, STIR nullifies fat tissue, which helps with tissue distinction. STIR has better sensitivity for cord pathologies than HASTE, which is more useful for CSF and cord differentiation.\nRepeat steps 2.3.7-2.3.8 to transfer the additional images for interpretation by the radiologist.\n3. Traumatic brain injury evaluation\nPerform the recommended protocol with a 1.5 T or 3 T scanner. Select scanners from the list available in Table 1.\nEnsure that traumatic brain injury (TBI) sequences include but are not limited to axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial gradient echo sequences (GRE), axial diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)- single-shot turbo spin echo, and axial and coronal HASTE.\nBe aware that insignificant variations may exist in TE, TR, matrix size, and field of view. Follow institutional imaging protocols or the parameters listed below.\n\t\nOf note: T2 GRE and T2 HASTE sequences most likely identify traumatic pathology.\nHemorrhage\n\t\nFollow steps 2.3.1-2.3.3 to select the patient for the study. After selecting patient positioning as Head First Supine, under Study, select NEURO BRAIN.\nAn additional list of protocols will populate, and from that list, select PEDS TRAUMA. Review this list to ensure it contains the sequences listed above in step 3.2.\nFor suspected hemorrhage, ensure that a radiologist interprets the GRE images. Use these parameters for best GRE imaging quality: slice thickness 4.0 mm, FoV 230 mm, TE 2.46 ms, TR 240 ms.\n\t\tNOTE: This sequence is notable for increased detection of extra-axial hemorrhage when compared to CT imaging.\nRepeat steps 2.3.7-2.3.8 to transfer the additional images for interpretation by the radiologist.\nDiffuse axonal injury\n\t\nIn addition to the GRE sequence, add an additional axial susceptibility weighted image (SWI) to the evaluation for diffuse axonal injury.\n\t\tNOTE: SWI images are more sensitive than GRE in terms of volume and number of detected hemorrhagic lesions.",
    "Repeat steps 3.4.1-3.4.2. Use these parameters for best SWI imaging quality: slice thickness 3.0 mm, FoV 220 mm, TE 20 ms, TR 27 ms.\nSWI imaging may result in longer acquisition times when compared with GRE and, therefore, is more likely to be degraded by motion artifacts. Review the soothing techniques above to assist in reducing motion artifacts.\nSkull fractures\n\t\nFor suspected skull fractures, the above sequences have little sensitivity. Add a black bone MRI sequence to the protocol above.\nSelect the black bone sequence by returning to the Patient Browser tab. From this tab, select the Neuro Brain protocol.\nFrom the list of additional protocols displayed on the left, select PEDS Trauma followed by the Black Bone sequence.\nThe black bone sequence is a GRE sequence with shorter TE and TR and an optimal flip angle to differentiate soft tissue and bone. Select these imaging protocols1,7: TE 4.20 ms, TR 8.60 ms, and flip angle of 5° under the Routine tab of the study properties screen.\nHead CT is the gold standard for evaluating skull fractures, as seen in Figure 1. Discuss risks and benefits with guardians and determine the most appropriate course. If the patient has completed a skeletal survey in TBI workup, examine the skull radiograph before initiating Head CT.\n4. Hydrocephalus and shunt evaluation\nPerform the protocol on 1.5 T or 3 T. Review sequences with standard commercially available hardware and software.\nHydrocephalus evaluation\n\t\nFollow steps 2.3.1-2.3.3 to select the patient for the study. After selecting patient positioning as Head First Supine, under Study, select Neuro Brain.\nAn additional list of protocols will populate. From that list, select Rapid Sequence.\nBegin the study with a localizer sequence named AAHScout. Ensure that this localizer sequence automatically begins at the start of the study.",
    "For evaluation of hydrocephalus, include a TurboFLASH T1-weighted sequence and a HASTE T2 weighted sequence. The TurboFLASH sequence is a modified GRE sequence with shorter TE, TR, and flip angles.\n\t\t\nFor HASTE T2 performed on a 1.5 T, use the following recommended parameters8: Repetition time (TR) 744 ms, echo time 104 ms, flip angle 150°, field of view 230 mm, matrix 256 × 156, number of acquisitions 1, slice thickness 4 mm with a skip of 1 mm, and I-PAT factor of 2.\nFor HASTE T2 performed on a 3 T, use the following recommended parameters8: 3-Tesla: TR 358 ms, echo time 90 ms, flip angle 150°, field of view 220 mm, matrix 256 × 156, number of acquisitions 1, slice thickness 4 mm with a skip of 1 mm and I-PAT factor of 2.\n\t\t\tNOTE: HASTE T2 weight images provide the best imaging quality for ventricular assessment. If a catheter is placed, the TurboFLASH T1-weighted images are better suited for catheter visualization.\nUse these imaging protocols for TurboFLASH T1-weighted sequence: slice thickness 4.0 mm, FoV 230 mm, TE 2.46 ms, TR 240 ms. Viewing the Exam tab on the left, ensure both sequences are in three planes- axial, sagittal, and coronal. Multiplanar imaging provides better visualization of the catheter when compared with uniplanar imaging.\nTransfer images using steps 2.3.7-2.3.8.\nShunt evaluation\n\t\nFollow the protocol above for hydrocephalus evaluation. Repeat the imaging sequence until a clear visualization of the shunt catheter is obtained.\n\t\tNOTE: A summary of recommended sequences can be found below in Table 1. Only high-yield sequences are included.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
