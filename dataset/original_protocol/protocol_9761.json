  "procedures": [
    "All experiments were approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee of the W.M. Keck Science Department, in accordance to NIH guidelines. All animals used were adults (>90 days post hatch).\n1. Construction of Operant Conditioning Chamber\nBuild a testing cage composed of two identical chambers, 15 x 15 x 17 inch3 each (Figure 1A). Make a small door (as an entrance to each chamber) on the side of the cage near the perches by cutting out a small 4.5 x 6 inch2 window that is 2.5 inchs away from the center of the cage between the chambers. Use a separate piece of the shelving to make a door that covers the window.\nNOTE: The cage is made from wire shelving for closets that can be obtained from any home improvement store. The hinge of the door can be made with zip-ties.\nCut the shelving with wire cutters to make a 4 x 6 inch2 opening between the two chambers to allow the bird to move between chambers.\nIn each chamber, place a perch 11 inches from the center of the cage and 6 in from the bottom of the cage. Use any perch that is suitable for the type of bird being tested and that will span the width of the cage.\nPlace the emitter and receiver of the photoelectric sensor on the cage directly above each end of the perch. Tether the sensors to the wire above the perch using zip-ties.",
    "NOTE: Placing the sensors onto a rigid backing (e.g., a tongue depressor) can help keep the sensors from twisting on the wire cage and becoming misaligned. It is important to test the placement of the sensors prior to each experiment by manually breaking the infrared (IR) beam. If the sensors are not correctly aligned, a bird will not trigger a song, or landing on the perch may be counted as multiple events.\nPlace under-cabinet LED lights on the top of the cage to provide enough illumination so that the animals will move freely between the two side chambers.\nPlace bird seed and water next to each of the perches.\nPlace a speaker at each end of each chamber.\nTo reduce sound diffraction and audio and visual distractions, place anechoic foam on the perimeter of the entire cage, with holes left for the cage doors and water bottles.\nConnect the speaker to an audio amplifier and connect the audio amplifier to the sound output on a computer.\n2. Connection of Sensors\nNOTE: There are two sets of IR sensors, each with an emitter and receiver. The emitter has a cable with four wires (brown, blue, black, and white). The receiver has a cable with three wires (brown, blue, and black). The white wire of one emitter is connected directly to input #1 on the digital I/O board. The white wire of the second emitter is connected directly to input #9. The AC power input has two wires (usually red and black).\nInstall a digital I/O card (Table of Materials), its drivers, and the associated program 'Measurement and Automation'.",
    "NOTE: The digital I/O card used here requires a connector block and multifunction ribbon cable to complete installation. Alternatively, a USB I/O device requires no PCI card (or the required connector block and ribbon cable accessories), and can be run on a laptop.\nConnect the two blue wires of each emitter and receiver set together. Attach two small wires to the black wire of the power cable so that the black power wire can connect to the blue wires of each sensor set.\nConnect the black power wire and two blue wires to a common wire. Connect this common wire to either input #2 or # 9 on the connector block.\nNOTE: One set of sensors should be connected to input #1 and #2 and the other set of sensors should be connected to input #9 and #10.\nFor both sensor sets, connect the brown wire from the emitter and the receiver together. For each sensor set, connect the two brown wires to the red AC power wire.\nNOTE: All four brown wires are connected to the red AC power wire. The photoelectric sensors are powered by a 10–30 V input and must be connected to an AC converter (e.g., a 120 V to 12 V converter).\nWithin the Measurement and Automation program associated with the digital I/O card, determine the Device ID for the I/O card by selecting the Devices and Interfaces menu.\nSelect 'Device Pinouts' option to determine the port and line number that correspond with the inputs in 2.3.\nVerify that the I/O detects when the IR beam is broken using the Test Panels… option in the program. Note the channel and port IDs for each set of sensors.\nNOTE: Green indicators will change color when the status of the beam is altered.",
    "3. Install Software and Hardware to Count Perch Landings\nDownload and install Sound Analysis Pro 2011 (SAP2011) and MySQL from http://soundanalysispro.com/.\nNOTE: This is freeware and comes with installation instructions and a user manual.\nOpen SAP recorder.exe.\nTo configure the sensor input so that SAP can detect perch landings and initiate song playbacks, click the Operant Devices tab in the SAP Recorder control window. Check the box Enable Operant Training (NI Card Installed).\nSelect the appropriate Device ID (the Ports slider can be set to 3). For each detector, indicate the appropriate port and line from the information collected in step 2.6.\nNOTE: When the port and line are set correctly for each detector, the light will change from yellow to red.\nIn the Main window for the SAP recorder, hit Train to activate the sensors for the appropriate channels.\nNOTE: A yellow button should appear.\nRecord the name of the bird by selecting the channel number of interest (Press channel 1 or 2 tab on the left side of the screen), and in the Identification and Mode window, type in the bird's identification in the Name field.\nTo ensure that sound is played to the speakers, manipulate the settings in the Output Selection tab to select the appropriate device connected to the computer (i.e., speakers) and the channel connected to the speaker.\nNOTE: Additional setup information can be found in the Sound Analysis Pro user manual.\n4. Isolate Pairs of Birds and Collect Male Song\nIsolate a male and a female finch in a sound-attenuation chamber for 24–48 h. During this cohabitation, collect the male song, which is referred to as the 'partner's song'.",
    "NOTE: Paired birds are a male and female that have been housed together for at least 2 weeks. Unpaired females are placed with a male for only 24–48 h.\n\t\nUse a microphone connected to an audio amplifier to capture the partner's song.\nAcquire the song using Sound Analysis Pro 2011 and store the song on a hard drive.\nTo test for the effect of the neurotransmitter systems on female song preference, give the female a 50 µL subcutaneous injection of saline (vehicle control) or quinpirole (1 mg/mL in 0.9% saline) when the pair is first put into the chamber. Repeat the injection after 6–24 h (see Figure 1B).\nCreate songs for playback in the operant conditioning cage.\n\t\nCreate a .wav file that plays 'silence' approximately the same length as the song playbacks.\nNOTE: This can be done using any sound-editing software (e.g., Audacity).\nCut a representative song (2–3 motifs) from the partner male.\nCut a representative song (2–3 motifs) from an unfamiliar male.\nNOTE: Use the same unfamiliar male song for all experiments.\nFilter the songs from 300 Hz–10 kHz.\nAdjust the volume so that the songs play at ~70 dB (average amplitude over the song duration from the speakers in the behavior chamber).\nNOTE: The volume of the song is tested using a sound pressure meter that is placed at the perch.\n5. Testing Song Preference in Paired Females\nDetermine the female's side chamber preference.\n\t\nPrior to the behavioral testing, place the female in the testing cage to allow her time to adjust to the cage for at least 1 h. Ensure the finch explores both side chambers by using an object to cause the bird to move from one chamber to the other through the opening.",
    "In Sound Analysis Pro, select the 'Playbacks' tab and then the 'Sounds' button in the main window.\nSelect the audio .wav file to play 'Silence' from chamber 1 and chamber 2.\nGo back to 'Main' and hit 'Reset' on the top of the boxes on the right.\nAfter the acclimation period, press 'Start'.\nAt the end of the session, press 'Stop'. Write down the number of triggers at each perch, which is displayed in the blue boxes.\nNOTE: The data are saved to a MySQL database. Have a minimum number of triggers to count the trial to ensure the female is active enough (e.g., 12 or more perches total).\nDetermine song preference.\n\t\nRepeat the steps in section 5.1, but choose the partner's song to play from the side chamber with the fewest perch triggers (the non-preferred side), and an unfamiliar song from the side chamber with the most perch triggers (the preferred side).\nNOTE: The partner's song is played from the side chamber with the fewest triggers during the playback of silence (the non-preferred side).\nPress 'reset' prior to starting the 1 h with song playback.\nCalculate the chamber and song preference by dividing the number of triggers on the side chamber playing the partner's song by the total number of triggers.\nSubscription Required.
