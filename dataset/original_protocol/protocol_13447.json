  "procedures": [
    "All animal experiments were conducted according to the United States National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Committee on the Ethics of North China University of Science and Technology (protocol code LX2019033 and 2019-3-3 of approval). Male Wistar rats, 3 weeks of age, were used for the present study. The animals were maintained in a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, and were provided with food and water ad libitum. Follow-up experiments were conducted after 1 week of adaptive feeding.\n1. Animal preparation\nUpon arrival, house all the rats in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) room.\nRandomly divide the healthy rats into two groups (n = 10): control rats inhaling pure air and rats with silicosis inhaling silica.\n2. Silica preparation\nCAUTION: Silica dust inhaled by the human body can damage the lungs. Therefore, individuals must wear overalls, medical gloves, and protective masks during operations.\nGround the silica particles (see Table of Materials) with an agate mortar for 1.5 h before each exposure. This is because freshly fractured quartz produces larger quantities of active oxygen species than aged quartz13, and silica with a diameter of 1-5 µm is the most pathogenic.\nWeigh the silica (30 g) using an electronic balance after grinding, place it in a glass container, and bake it at 180 °C for 6 h in an electric heating air-blowing drier (see Table of Materials) to eliminate pathogens from the surface of the silica particles.\n3. Silica exposure to the rats\nConnect the injection and the commercially available generator systems (see Table of Materials) and place the silica (30 g) in the generator. Check whether the connection pipeline is normal, the power cord is connected, and the power supply is normal.",
    "Check the water level of the spray tower and the humidifier of the waste gas treatment device (see Table of Materials) manually, and add water if it is insufficient (not up to the standard line).\nAdd tap water to the spray tower of the waste gas treatment device and distilled water to the humidifier (Figure 1).\nTurn on the exhaust gas discharge device (see Table of Materials) and the air source switch to confirm whether the inside of the shielding cabinet is in a negative-pressure state.\n\t\nConfirm that the liquid mixing, powder mixing, pure gas flow control valves, and wastewater discharge valve under the inhalation chamber are closed.\nPlace a total of 10 rats in the inhalation chamber (see Table of Materials), and close the inhalation compartment and the screened cabinet doors.\nSet the following experimental parameters on the instrument panel or in the computer: cabinet pressure: -50 to -30 Pa; oxygen concentration: 21%; cabinet temperature: 20-25 °C; humidity: 70%-75%; dust entry rate: 2.0-2.5 mL/min; and cabinet dust concentration: 60 ± 5 mg/m3.\n\tNOTE: Observe the experimental data and equipment status continuously during the experiment. The equipment failure alarm prompted timely processing.\n\t\nExpose each animal to silica continuously for 3 h per day, 5 days per week, and allow the animals in the control group to inhale pure air.\nOn completion of the experiment, close the mixed gas flow control valve, and open the pure gas flow valve. Inject the pure gas continuously into the inhalation chamber.\n\tNOTE: In the present study, the pure gas flow (7.0-7.5 m3/h) was injected for at least 20 min until the poisonous gas in the inhalation chamber was completely replaced.\n\t\nClose the pure air-flow valve, open the door, take the rats out, and send them back to the pathogen-free room.",
    "Remove the rat rack and the branch pipe components in sequence and place them in the sink for cleaning. After rinsing, close the automatic cleaning valve and open the hatch.\n\t\nWipe the inner wall with a clean cloth, or turn on the pure gas to dry the tank. Finally, carry out the disinfection. After cleaning and disinfecting with 75% ethanol, close the exhaust gate and, as soon as possible, slightly open the door of the inhalation cabin to evaporate the moisture, so that the inside of the inhalation cabin remains dry.\nCheck the silica concentration in the cabinet with a comprehensive atmospheric sampler following the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials) twice a week to ensure the stability of the silica concentration during the experiment. Calibrate the atmospheric sampler before sampling.\n\t\nUse a digital single-pan analytical balance for gravimetric determination. The calculated silica concentration was 65 mg/m3 (Figure 1 and Table 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Weigh the filter paper before and after the absorption of silica. The concentration of silica was calculated using the following formula12:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64467/64467eq01.jpg\n\t\twhere W2 = weight of the filter paper after sampling, W1 = weight of the filter paper before sampling, and V = volume of the air.\n4. Acquisition and fixation of lung tissues\nEuthanize the rats by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg body weight). Assess the death by the loss of heartbeat14.\nAt the end of the experiment, fix the right lower lung, kidney, liver, spleen, and bone with 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24 h, embed in paraffin, and cut into 5 µm sections7,15.\n5. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining",
    "Deparaffinize the paraffin sections in xylol (see Table of Materials) twice for 10 min each16, and rehydrate in 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and distilled water for 3 min each.\nStain the sections with hematoxylin (see Table of Materials) for 5 min, and then wash the sections with water10.\nPlace the sections in 2% hydrochloric alcohol and then in distilled water until the color changes to blue.\nStain the sections with eosin for 1 min, dehydrate them with 95% ethanol, make them transparent with xylene, seal them with neutral gum, and observe under a light microscope12.\n6. Immunohistochemical staining\nRoutinely wash the paraffin sections with water.\nExpose the antigens at high pressure (60 kPa) and high temperature (100 °C) for 80 s and then block with an endogenous peroxidase blocker (3%) for 15 min to eliminate the endogenous peroxidases7.\nIncubate the samples with antibodies directed against CD68 (1:200 dilution-add 4 µL of CD68 to 396 µL of antibody diluent; see Table of Materials) at 4 °C overnight.\nIncubate the samples with a secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG polymer; see Table of Materials) at 37 °C for 30 min, and then wash the samples with 1x PBS.\nVisualize the immunoreactivity with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB; see Table of Materials). After applying DAB to the tissue, observe the staining of the tissue under a light microscope10.\n\tNOTE: The staining time varied from a few seconds to a few minutes according to the staining time of the tissue. The staining procedure was aborted by placing the sections in water. In this study, the brown staining of the tissue represented the positive expression of CD68. All antibodies were diluted in 1x PBS.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
