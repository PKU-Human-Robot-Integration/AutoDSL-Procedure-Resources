    "1. Preparation of crRNA\nPreparation of crRNA templates\nRe-suspend individual oligonucleotides (Table 1) in RNase-free water to a concentration of 10 µM.\nAdd 22.5 µL of top-strand oligonucleotide (T7-F in Table 1), 22.5 µL of bottom-strand oligonucleotide (Table 1), and 5 µL of 10x annealing buffer to a 0.2 mL PCR tube. Ensure that the total volume is 50 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: Six different bottom-strand oligonucleotides are shown in Table 1, each of which should be individually paired with the top-strand T7-F. The lowercase letters in Table 1 represent the sequence to be transcribed into the guide sequence of crRNA. 10x Taq PCR buffer can be used instead of the 10x annealing buffer.\nPlace the PCR tube into a thermocycler.\nRun the annealing program: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and then a cooldown from 95-20 °C, with a 1 °C decrease per min on the thermocycler.\n\t\tNOTE: Immediately use the samples for step 1.2.1.\nTranscription and purification of crRNA\nAdd 38 µL of RNase-free water, 8 µL of the template from step 1.1.4, 20 µL of 5x T7 transcription buffer, 20 µL of NTP mixture (10 µM), 4 µL of recombinant RNase inhibitor (RRI), and 10 µL of T7 RNA polymerase to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Ensure that the total volume is 100 µL.\nPut the microcentrifuge tube in a 37 °C water bath overnight (for about 16 h).\nUse an RNA cleanup and concentration kit to purify the transcribed RNA; follow the manufacturer's protocol.\nQuantitate the RNAs with UV-Vis spectrophotometers and dilute the RNA to a concentration of 10 µM. Use the samples immediately or store them at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The crRNA sequences are listed in Table 2.\n2. Construction of C-Brick Parts ( i.e., the Insertion of Biological Parts into a C-Brick Standard Vector)",
    "NOTE: This step has three sub-steps. For short biological parts (e.g., promoters and terminators), it is best to use the direct PCR method to insert the biological parts into a C-Brick standard vector4. The whole vector sequence is shown in the supplementary data, and the prefix and suffix sequence is shown in Figure 1 (step 2.1, below). For biological parts that can be easily obtained via PCR (e.g., with templates of genomic DNA, plasmids, or de novo synthesized DNA sequences), it is best to use the seamless assembly method to insert the biological parts into a C-Brick standard vector (step 2.2, below). For those parts obtained from BioBrick and BglBrick standards, restriction enzyme-mediated digestion and T4 DNA ligase-mediated ligation can be used to insert the biological parts into a C-Brick standard vector (step 2.3, below).\nConstruction via direct PCR amplification\nDesign and order oligonucleotides for PCR amplification.\n\t\tNOTE: The 5'-end of the oligonucleotide contains the sequence of the DNA part, and 3'-end of the oligonucleotide contains the vector sequence (i.e., \"GGATCCACTAGTCTCTAGCTCG\" at the 3'-end of the forward strand and \"GGATCCTTTCTCCTCTTTCTAG\" in the reverse strand). Either no overhang or a ~20-bp overhang can be designed at the 5'-end of the oligonucleotide. Specific examples can be found in a previous study4.\nRe-suspend individual oligonucleotides in ultra-pure water to a concentration of 10 µM.\nSet up PCR reactions on ice in a 0.2 mL PCR tube: add 18 µL of ultra-pure water, 25 µL of 2x PCR buffer, 1 µL of dNTPs (10 µM), 2.5 µL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 µM) from step 2.1.2, 0.5 µL of C-Brick standard vector (50 ng) as a template, and 0.5 µL of high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Ensure that the total volume is 50 µL.",
    "Place the tube directly into a thermocycler and start the thermocycler program. Use the samples immediately or freeze and store them at -20 °C.\nThermocycler program: one cycle for 3 min at 98 °C; thirty cycles for 10 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and one cycle for 10 min at 72 °C. Keep the sample at 16 °C.\nAdd 9 µL of the mixture from step 2.1.4 to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 1 µL of DpnI and incubate for 1 h in a 37 °C water bath.\n\t\tNOTE:　If the primers have no overlapping sequences, add 0.5 µL of T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and 0.5 µL of T4 DNA ligase and incubate in a 22 °C water bath for 1 h. Otherwise, if the primers contain a ~20 nt overlapping sequence, directly transform the DpnI-treated products into E. coli (DH10B)-competent cells (step 2.4). The linearized PCR product will be circularized by the recombination system in the host.\nUse the samples immediately or store them at -20 °C.\nConstruction via seamless assembly\nDesign and order oligonucleotides for PCR amplification.\n\t\tNOTE: The 3'-end of the oligonucleotide contains the terminal sequence of the DNA part, and the 5'-end of the oligonucleotide contains the terminal of the linearized C-Brick standard vector sequence (i.e., \"CTAGAAAGAGGAGAAAGGATCC\" for the 5'-end of the forward strand and \"CGAGCTAGAGACTAGTGGATCC\" for the 5'-end of the reverse strand). Specific examples can be found in a previous study4.\nRe-suspend the individual oligonucleotides in ultra-pure water to a concentration of 10 µM.",
    "Set up PCR reactions on ice in a 0.2 mL PCR tube: add 18 µL of ultra-pure water, 25 µL of 2x PCR buffer, 1 µL of dNTPs (10 µM), 2.5 µL each of the forward and reverse primers (10 µM) from step 2.2.2, 0.5 µL of template (20-500 ng), and 0.5 µL of high-fidelity DNA polymerase.

Use the samples immediately or freeze and store them at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Set the thermocycler program to: one cycle for 3 min at 98 °C; 30 cycles for 10 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 55 °C (according to the annealing temperature of the primer), and 1 min (according to the length of the biological parts) at 72 °C; and one cycle for 10 min at 72 °C. Keep the sample at 16 °C.\nPurify the PCR product using a PCR cleanup system kit; follow the manufacturer's protocol.\nDigest the C-Brick standard vector with BamHI: add 34 µL of ultra-pure water, 10 µL of plasmid (1 µg), 5 µL of 10x buffer, and 1 µL of BamHI to the microcentrifuge tube. Incubate for up to 2 h at 37 °C in a water bath.\nPurify the above product using a gel cleanup system kit; follow the manufacturer's protocol.\nAdd 2 µL of linearized vector (50 ng) from step 2.2.7, 5 µL of fragment (200 ng) from step 2.2.4, 2 µL of 5x seamless assembly buffer, and 1 µL of seamless assembly enzyme from a seamless assembly kit to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.Ensure that the total volume is 10 µL.",
