    "This research was approved with a full waiver of informed consent by the University of Texas at Austin Institutional Review Board (IRB 2011-02-0021).\n1. Beginning and Introducing the Session\nAsk participants to begin the session online.\n\tNOTE: The session can take place in a lab or on participants' own computers (desktop or laptop) outside the lab. The study requires a digital survey platform that has a time-based automatic proceeding feature (e.g., Qualtrics).\nAsk participants to read basic descriptions of the overall survey procedure (e.g., expected duration, required survey-taking device, and anonymity of responses) and an online consent form, if applicable. Ask participants to click the \"Continue\" button at the bottom of the screen to proceed when ready.\n2. Foreshadowing the Interruption and Providing Task Overview\nPresent participants with the \"Important Notice\" message on the screen (Figure 1). Use the notice to inform participants that, at some point during the session, they will be interrupted briefly but suddenly by the \"Natural-Typing Task,\" designed to measure participants' natural typing speeds. Inform participants that this task will involve typing 49 nonsense words with no meaning (e.g., tregran or mip).\n\t\nBelow the notice, present a question asking whether the participants have carefully read all the information about the interruption. Ask participants to select \"Yes\" and click the \"Continue\" button to proceed to the next page.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55650/55650fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Informing Participants about a Future Interruption. Participants are informed that they will suddenly be interrupted sometime during the session with a \"Natural-Typing Task.\" Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55650/55650fig1large.jpg]",
    "On the next page, present an overview of the three tasks that participants will supposedly be doing (Figure 2). Provide a brief description and the expected duration of each task. Ask participants to click the \"Continue\" button after reading the overview information to proceed to the next page.\n\tNOTE: It is critical that the expected duration information is consistent, because participants will later choose between completing either the second task or the third task.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55650/55650fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Task Overview. Participants are shown an overview of all tasks that they would possibly be completing. The expected duration is provided and kept constant so that it does not affect participants' choices later, when they have to choose between the second and third tasks.

Activation of the Proposed Cognitive Goal\nInform participants that they will now start the \"Relationship Conflict Task,\" and have them click the \"Continue\" button to proceed.\n\tNOTE: The purpose of the first task is to manipulate the presence or absence of a cognitive goal. In the work by Namkoong and Henderson11, the \"Relationship Conflict Task\" was designed to manipulate either high or low causal uncertainty, because it was proposed that this would activate or not activate a goal to think more abstractly. The following steps use this particular procedure as an example.\nAsk participants to recall a recent relationship conflict they had with someone they are close to. Use an open-ended format (i.e., \"What was the conflict about?\").\n\t\nBelow the open-ended question, ask questions about this incident, such as who the conflict was with and how intense the conflict was. Then, ask participants to click the \"Continue\" button to proceed to the next page.",
    "NOTE: The reason for asking questions about the recalled incident is to ensure that participants come up with a specific conflict (as opposed to general dissatisfaction) in a relationship.\nManipulate high or low causal uncertainty by asking participants to elaborate on the recent relationship conflict, with a focus on high or low causal uncertainty, respectively (Figure 3). Ask participants to type their responses inside a textbox and, when finished, click the \"Continue\" button to proceed to the next page.\nAsk manipulation check questions (i.e., experienced causal uncertainty).\n\t\nSpecifically, ask participants to use seven-point scales to indicate how much they agree or disagree with the following two statements: \"I feel like there are many things about this conflict that I still don't fully understand\" and \"I feel like I have a very good understanding about why the conflict happened\" (reverse-coded) before clicking the \"Continue\" button to go to the next page.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55650/55650fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Instructions in the High Versus Low Causal Uncertainty Conditions. In the high causal uncertainty condition (top), participants are asked to write about the things they do not understand about the conflict in terms of why it happened. In the low causal uncertainty condition (bottom), participants are asked to write about the things they understand well about the conflict.

Manipulating Expectations to Satisfy the Cognitive Goal\nInform participants that they will now start the \"Picture Impression Task\" and have them click the \"Continue\" button to proceed.",
    "NOTE: To test the activation of an abstract thinking goal, the \"Picture Impression Task\" and the description shown to participants involve either abstract thinking (i.e., similarity-focus; expected to satisfy the cognitive goal) or concrete thinking (i.e., difference-focus; expected to dissatisfy the cognitive goal) based on prior work25,26 and a pilot study result11.\nDescribe to participants what the \"Picture Impression Task\" entails. In the similarity-focus (difference-focus) condition, inform participants that they will see five pairs of pictures and that, for each pair, they must identify one thing that makes the pictures similar to (different from) each other (Figure 4). Ask participants to click the \"Continue\" button to proceed to the next page after reading the descriptions.\nShow participants an incomplete image to make the screen appear as if the first pair of pictures of the \"Picture Impression Task\" is being loaded, without showing any parts of the pictures (Figure 5). After 2 - 3 s, have the screen automatically proceed to a different page to start the task interruption procedure.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55650/55650fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. \"Picture Impression Task\" Instructions in the Similarity- Versus Difference-Focus Conditions. In the similarity-focus condition (top), participants are told that they will be looking for similarities between pictures; in the difference-focus condition (bottom), participants are told that they will be looking for differences between pictures.

Loading Images. Participants see a screen that is apparently loading the first pair of pictures. This figure belongs to the similarity-focus condition. It is important to note that, before any parts of the pictures appear, participants are interrupted and their screen changes to the \"Natural-Typing Task\" screen shown in Figure 6.

    "Instruct participants to complete the \"Natural Typing Task\" by clicking the \"Start\" button, typing the 49 nonsense words presented on the screen, and clicking the \"Continue\" button when finished (Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: Researchers should record the duration of the interruption (i.e., how much time participants spent on the interruption page typing the words on the screen) to check if it varied as a result of any of the manipulations. Interruption duration should also be considered as a control variable in the main analyses because it can affect task resumption rate27.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55650/55650fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Task Interruption. Participants are interrupted with the \"Natural-Typing Task.\" Here, they are asked to type 49 nonsense words so the researchers can measure their natural typing speed.

Task Resumption as a Dependent Variable\nInform participants that, instead of completing all tasks as originally planned, they must choose between the second task and the third task. Specifically, instruct participants to choose between resuming the interrupted \"Picture Impression Task\" (which means giving up the \"Humor Evaluation Task\") or completing the \"Humor Evaluation Task\" (which means abandoning the \"Picture Impression Task\").\n\tNOTE: The dependent variable observed is the rate of task resumption. The premise is that participants will be more likely to resume the interrupted task at the cost of engaging in a more enjoyable alternative if the interrupted task is perceived as an opportunity to satisfy the active cognitive goal.\n\t\nOn the same screen, show the task descriptions (Figure 7). Remind participants that both tasks will 2 min and will involve five trials (five pairs of pictures or five humorous stories, depending on the condition) to prevent them from choosing the task that simply seems easier or quicker to finish.",
    "NOTE: A pilot test should be performed to verify that the third task is indeed expected by participants to be more enjoyable than the second task in the absence of the cognitive goal11. This will also help to avoid a ceiling effect, which is a potential concern because task-resumption motivation is generally high, even without the activation of a particular cognitive goal, as demonstrated by Zeigarnik28.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55650/55650fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Recording Task Resumption. Participants are told that they can now do only one of the two remaining tasks. They can either resume the \"Picture Impression Task\" (and not the \"Humor Evaluation Task\") or jump to the \"Humor Evaluation Task\" (and abandon the \"Picture Impression Task\").

Concluding the Session\nConclude the session by allowing the participants to complete the task of their choice and by asking demographics questions of interest. Debrief the participants.\n\tNOTE: The dependent variable data was collected in the previous stage, so the actual task activities (how participants answer questions in the \"Picture Impression Task\" or the \"Humor Evaluation Task\") are no longer relevant from an empirical perspective, as long as the tasks appear realistic to participants.\nSubscription Required.
