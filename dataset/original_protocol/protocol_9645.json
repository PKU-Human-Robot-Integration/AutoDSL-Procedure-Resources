    "1. Preparation of the silicon wafer mold\nClean the silicon wafer (see Table of Materials) first with acetone and then with isopropyl alcohol (IPA).\nPlace the silicon wafer on a 250 °C hot plate for 30 min for dehydration bake (Figure 3A).\nCoat the silicon wafer with hexamethyldisilazane (HDMS) in a vapor prime oven (see Table of Materials) (process temperature: 150 °C, process pressure: 2 Torr, process time: 5 min, HDMS volume: 5 µL) (Figure 3B).\nPlace a bottle of SU-8 2100 photoresist (see Table of Materials) in a 60 °C oven for 15 min to reduce its viscosity.\n\tNOTE: Upon heating in the oven, the viscosity of the photoresist decreases. Photoresists with lowered viscosity can be handled more easily and can be poured more accurately on top of the wafer.\nPlace the silicon wafer on a 60 °C hot plate and pour 1 mL of the heated photoresist for each inch of the wafer until the photoresist covers most of the surface (Figure 3C).\nTransfer the photoresist-coated silicon wafer to a spin coater (see Table of Materials).\nApply pre-spin first at 250 rpm for 30 s and then at 350 rpm for another 30 s, both with 100 rpm/s acceleration (Figure 3D).\nRemove the excess photoresist from the edges of the silicon wafer using a cleanroom swab.\nApply a spin first at 500 rpm for 15 s with 100 rpm/s acceleration and then at 1450 rpm for 30 s with 300 rpm/s acceleration (Figure 3E).\nRemove the edge bead with a cleanroom swab.\nPlace the silicon wafer on a 50 °C hot plate and spray acetone on the wafer to remove imperfections and promote uniform coating (Figure 3F).\nSlowly ramp up the temperature of the hot plate to 95 °C at the rate of 2°C/min.",
    "Soft bake the silicon wafer at 95 °C for 50 min (Figure 3G).\nSlowly cool down the hot plate to room temperature at a rate of 2°C/min.\nPlace the silicon wafer on a mask aligner (see Table of Materials) and place the photomask on top of it (please refer to Supplementary Figure 1 for the photomask geometry).\nExpose the silicon wafer to 350 mJ/cm2 UV light (35 mW/cm2 for 10 s) through the photomask using the contact mask aligner (Figure 3H).\nApply consecutive post-exposure bakes on the silicon wafer by placing the wafer on a hot plate at 50 °C for 5 min, at 65 °C for an additional 5 min, and finally at 80 °C for another 20 min (Figure 3I).\nSlowly cool down the silicon wafer to room temperature at the rate of 2 °C/min.\nPlace a magnetic stirrer with a slightly smaller diameter than the silicon wafer in a beaker. Turn the silicon wafer upside-down and place it on top of the beaker.\nPlace the beaker inside another larger beaker and fill the larger beaker with a fresh developer solution (see Table of Materials). Leave the silicon wafer submerged in the developer for 30 min with the stirrer turned on (Figure 3J).\nTransfer the silicon wafer into an ultrasonic bath sonicator filled with the fresh developer for 1 h at 40 kHz (Figure 3K).\nThoroughly wash the silicon wafer with an IPA solution to obtain the final silicon wafer mold (Figure 3L).\n2. Fabrication of the microfluidic chip\nPlace the silicon wafer mold in a desiccator together with 10 drops (~500 µL) of Trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (PFOCTS, see Table of Materials) in a small weigh boat nearby.\nConnect the desiccator to a vacuum pump at approximately 200 Torr for 30 min.",
    "Turn off the desiccator valve and disconnect the vacuum pump overnight for PFOCTS coating.\nPrepare the pre-cured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) solution by mixing the PDMS base with the curing agent (see Table of Materials) at a 10:1 ratio.\nDegas the mixture by placing it into a centrifuge (500 x g for 5 min at room temperature).\n\tNOTE: This centrifugation allows bubbles to migrate to the top surface and consequently be removed in a short period of time.\nPour the degassed PDMS solution onto the silicon wafer mold.\nDegas it again to remove the air bubbles trapped on the mold surface.\nCure the PDMS in a 60 °C oven for 1 h and 50 min (Figure 3M).\nUse a scalpel to cut the borders of the cured PDMS region corresponding to the microfluidic chip geometry (Figure 3N).\nPeel the PDMS part and place it upside-down on a cutting mat.\nUse a razor to cut the PDMS part into its final shape (Figure 3O).\nPunch the inlet and outlet holes on PDMS using a biopsy punch (see Table of Materials) or a needle with a blunt tip (Figure 3P).\n\t\nFor the embryo inlet hole, use a 4 mm diameter punch.\nFor the embryo outlet holes, use a 1.3 mm diameter punch.\nFor the gas inlet hole, use a 2 mm punch.\nUse a piece of scotch tape to remove any particulate that might remain on the patterned surface of the PDMS.\nClean a 24 mm x 60 mm rectangular glass slide first with acetone and then with IPA.\nDry the glass surface with an air gun connected to a filtered air source.\nApply a dehydration bake to the glass slide by placing it on a 250 °C hot plate for 2 h (Figure 3Q).",
    "Cover the glass slide with a beaker to prevent surface contamination.\nPlace the PDMS, with its patterned side up, and the dehydrated glass slide into a plasma cleaner (see Table of Materials).\nTreat the PDMS and the glass slide with oxygen plasma at 18 W for 30 s.\nPlace the PDMS on the glass slide with its patterned surface facing toward the glass slide to seal the microchannels via covalent bonding (Figure 3R).\nUse tweezers to gently push the PDMS part against the glass slide to ensure full conformational contact.\nStore the completed microfluidic chip at room temperature overnight to allow the bonding to reach its final strength.\n3. Preparation of the fruit fly embryos\nAllow Oregon-R adult flies to lay eggs on apple juice agar plates (1.5% agar, 25% apple juice, 2.5% sucrose) and collect the plates at the desired developmental time after egg laying for the given experiment.\n\tNOTE: For the present experiments, the plates were collected at 140 min to prepare and sort for embryos at the cellularization stage17.\nFlood the agar with embryo egg wash (0.12 M NaCl, 0.04% Triton-X 100) and gently agitate the embryos with a paintbrush to dislodge them from the agar.\nTransfer the embryos to a 50% bleach solution for 90 s, stirring occasionally. Strain the embryos through a tissue sieve and thoroughly wash away the bleach solution with water.\nTransfer the embryos to a 90 mm glass Petri dish with enough embryo egg wash to fully cover the embryos.\nExamine the embryos with transillumination on a dissecting microscope and select embryos of the desired development stage for loading into the microfluidic device.",
    "​NOTE: In this application, embryos at the cellularization stage were selected. The detailed descriptions of how to ensure proper developmental stage selection can be found in the laboratory handbook for Drosophila17.\n4. Applying mechanical stimulation to fruit fly embryos using the microfluidic chip\nPrime all seven embryo microchannels by filling them with 0.4 µm filtered IPA through the main embryo inlet port.\nReplace the IPA with 0.4 µm filtered deionized (DI) water.\nReplace the DI water with embryo egg wash solution.\nCollect approximately 100 preselected embryos from the glass Petri dish using a glass pipette.\nPipette the embryos into the embryo inlet port (Figure 4A).\nApply an approximately 3 PSI negative pressure (i.e., vacuum) to the gas inlet using a portable vacuum pump to open up the embryo microchannels.\nTilt the microfluidic chip downward for the embryos to automatically align and settle into the embryo microchannels (Figure 4B).\nIf the embryo microchannel inlets get clogged by multiple embryos entering simultaneously, tilt the microfluidic chip upward and then downward again to clear the clogging.\nBased on the required throughput, introduce as many as 300 embryos into the embryo microchannels.\nOnce the embryo loading is completed, remove the vacuum to immobilize the embryos.\nTilt the microfluidic chip back to the horizontal position (Figure 4C).\nConnect a portable positive pressure source (see Table of Materials) with a pressure gauge to the gas inlet to apply 3 PSI compression (Figure 4D).\nContinuously check the pressure gauge to ensure a consistent compression level is applied.\nIf live imaging experiments will be conducted on the mechanically stimulated embryos, place the microfluidic chip on a standard microscope stage glass slide holder with the gas inlet connected to the pressure source.",
    "Once the compression experiment is completed, the embryos can be collected for downstream analysis. In order to do this, first, apply the vacuum to the gas inlet to free the embryos.\nThen, tilt the microfluidic chip upward for the embryos to move toward the embryo introduction port (Figure 4E).\nCollect the embryos from the microfluidic chip using a glass pipette.\n\tNOTE: Upon collection, the effects of compression on embryonic development and viability can be investigated by growing the fruit flies into adulthood. The high-throughput processing capability of the microfluidic device also enables embryos to be used in downstream omics-based assays that require a large number of samples (Figure 2).\nSubscription Required.
