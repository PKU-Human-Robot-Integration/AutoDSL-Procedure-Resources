    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      The protocol below shows the procedure for a time course of 2 days (10\n      time points) at 6-h intervals.\n    \nPreparation of culture media\nTiming: 1–2 h\n      This section describes how to prepare the medium and dispense it into\n      dishes. To streamline the process, prepare media for washing and\n      re-culture for use after synchronizing stimulation with DEX as well as\n      media for pre-culture at the same time. You can do this on the day of lung\n      sectioning (Day 1 below) or the day before. If prepared the day before,\n      store the medium at 4°C in a sealed container to prevent evaporation\n      before use.\n    \n        Add FBS (Sigma SIGMA, Cat#173012) to the basal tissue slice culture\n        media at a ratio of 1:10.\n      \nNote: There is no problem using FBS used\n      for cell culture.\n    \n        Dispense the FBS-supplemented culture media at 1.8 mL per non-treated\n        35 mm dish.\n      \nNote: The number of dishes is twice that\n      of the total needed in the experiment because they will be used for both\n      pre-culture and re-culture.\n    \n        Dispense the basal culture media at 1.8 mL per 35 mm dish for washing.\n      \n        Put the inserts in the dishes with media for pre-culture (no need for\n        washing and re-culture).\n      \nAlternatives: If you use\n      commercially available culture inserts (Merck Millipore, Cat# PICM0RG50)\n      dispense 1.2 mL media per dish.\n    \nNote: One slice on a culture insert of\n      liver, pancreas, aorta, and white adipose tissue other than lung can also\n      be cultured in this culture media.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Therefore, this experimental protocol can be\n      applied to tissues other than lung. However, note that we tested this\n      protocol using liver, and the detection of circadian rhythm was more\n      stable in lung than in liver.\n    \nDay 1: Lung sectioning and slicing\nTiming:  < 1 h",
    "On Day 1, lung slices are prepared and culture begins (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Conduct this procedure as quickly as possible to prevent deterioration\n      of the slices.\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2674-Fig5.jpg\n          Figure 5. Schematic diagram of the lung slice preparation process\n        \n          (A–C) Cut out a portion of the lung as shown by the red line in\n          (A) and make slices with a chopper (red dotted line shown in B). Place\n          about 10 slices on the membrane of one insert (C).\n        \n        Prepare tools and solutions.\n        \n            Prepare the necessary tools for dissection (scissors, tweezers,\n            razor blade and syringe with a 23G needle) and wipe them with 70%\n            ethanol.\n          \n            Fill 35 mm glass Petri dishes with ice-cold HBSS containing 1% HEPES\n            and place them on ice (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2674-Fig6.jpg\n                  Figure 6. Suggested setup for a part of the working space\n                \n                  35 mm glass dishes are filled with HBSS containing 1% HEPES.\n                  Wash the dissected tissue a total of twice, once in each glass\n                  dish. Cut rods from the lung on a cutting stage with filter\n                  paper moistened with HBSS supplemented with 1% HEPES. Float\n                  the slices in the HBSS (+1% HEPES) in the third glass dish.\n                \nPlace the dishes with inserts on ice.\n            Put a 10 mm plastic culture dish on ice upside down, place a\n            circular filter paper (φ 7.0 cm) over it, and moisten it with HBSS\n            (+1% HEPES). Use this as a cutting stage (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\n          \nSet up the chopping machine (McIlwain, Cat# 51350).\n            Set the thickness to 300 μm and an appropriate sectioning speed.\n          \n            Attach a blade to the holder. Wipe the blade with 70% ethanol using\n            a cotton swab.\n          \n            Layer two sheets of filter paper (φ 5.5 cm) on the circular\n            stainless-steel table.\n          \n            Adjust the angle of the blade arm by test cutting the weighing paper",
    "until cut lines are visible in the center portion of the stage.\n          \nNote: Detailed information about the\n      chopper apparatus can be found at the link:\n      http://www.limef.com/Downloads/McIlwain_manual.pdf[href=http://www.limef.com/Downloads/McIlwain_manual.pdf]\n        Administer anesthesia inhalation (isoflurane) to the mouse and euthanize\n        it by cervical dislocation.\n      \n        Spray the mouse with 70% ethanol. Incise the skin from the abdomen to\n        the ribcage using scissors and cut the muscle to expose the abdominal\n        cavity and organs.\n      \n        Dissect the lung and wash it in the ice-cold HBSS containing 1% HEPES.\n        Place it on the cutting stage.\n      \n        Cut out a thin rod of tissue (1–2 mm width) from the edge of the lung\n        with a razor blade and place it on the sterilized weighing paper.\n      \n        Place the specimen on the weighing paper on the circular stainless-steel\n        table of the chopping machine. Start cutting while fixing the paper with\n        your fingers (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2674-Fig7.jpg\n              Figure 7. Procedure from cutting the slices to setting up the\n              culture\n            \n              (A) Picture just before cutting the lung portion with the chopping\n              machine. The rod of tissue cut out from the lung and the cutting\n              arm are placed vertically.\n            \n              (B) The weighing paper is folded at the line the slices are on,\n              and the slice is slid off the weighing paper using the side of the\n              needle to float the slice in the HBSS (+1% HEPES) solution.\n            \n              (C) The slices are transferred to the handmade culture insert. The\n              expanded image in the balloon shows how the slices are handled to\n              avoid damage (see text).\n            \n(D) Lung slices are placed on the handmade culture insert.\n              (E) Dish containing lung slices sealed with Parafilm. Slices are\n              cultured in this state at 37°C.\n            \nCAUTION: This type of chopping machine does not have a guard around\n      the cutting blade. Be very careful not to cut your fingers with the blade.",
    "Using the side of the syringe needle, slide off the sliced lung from the\n        weighing paper and float it in the ice-cold HBSS (+ 1% HEPES) solution\n        (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\n      \n        Place the slices one by one on the inserts so that they do not overlap.\n        Finally, about 10 slices per insert should be placed (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D).\n      \n      Pick up a slice very gently by lifting it so that it is held in the water\n      column of buffer that forms between the tips of round-tipped tweezers\n      without directly touching the slice (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\n    \nNote: Since the quality of each slice will\n      vary, the slices obtained from one rod should be placed randomly on each\n      insert to average them out.\n    \n        Observe each slice under a stereomicroscope. If it is folded, spread it\n        out with the tip of a syringe needle so that it lies flat. Be careful\n        not to damage the slice.\n      \n        After all sample dishes are ready, seal the dishes with parafilm and\n        place them in an incubator at 37°C to begin incubation (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E).\n      \nDay 2: Circadian rhythm synchronization with DEX\nTiming: 2 h\n      Just before initiating DEX stimuli, slices should be harvested for time\n      point 0 samples according to the procedure described in the Day 2–4 step.\n    \n      After approximately 24 h of incubation, synchronizing stimulation using\n      DEX is conducted. This aligns the phases of the circadian rhythm of each\n      cell of the slice, making the circadian rhythm stable and easy to observe\n      in the time-course. Steps 16 and 18 should be conducted on a clean bench.\n    \nCritical: A few hours before starting\n      this step, place dishes containing medium for washing and re-culture in an\n      incubator and keep them at 37°C before use. If the medium has been\n      dispensed the previous day, bring it first to room temperature (20°C–30°C",
    ") and then to 37°C.\n    \n        Prepare 1.8 μL aliquots of 100 mM DEX in 1.5 mL test tubes for the\n        number of samples.\n      \n        Remove the samples from the incubator, and pipet a 500 μL portion of\n        medium from the culture in the 1.5 mL test tube with DEX. Return the\n        mixture of media and DEX to the dish and swirl it softly to mix (100 nM\n        final concentration).\n      \nNote: Collection of medium by pipetting is\n      made easier by elevating the insert with tweezers.\n    \nIncubate the samples for 1 h at 37°C.\n        To wash out the DEX, put the inserts in dishes containing washing media.\n        After all have been put in dishes, transfer them to dishes of re-culture\n        medium, seal the dishes with parafilm, and restart incubation.\n      \nCritical: After the inserts are\n      transferred to the washing medium, swirling is not required. The washing\n      process should involve moving the insert only and should not involve any\n      unnecessary stimulus.\n    \nDay 2–4: Harvesting tissue slices\nTiming: 2 days\nTiming: 30 min at each time point (for\n      steps 20–22)\n    \n      This section describes how to harvest and homogenize the tissue slices.\n      Homogenization is the first step in RNA extraction.\n    \n        Dispense 300 μL RLT buffer (Qiagen) into the 1.5 mL test tubes with the\n        textured inside of a BioMasher II (Nippi, Cat# 320102).\n      \n        At harvesting time, harvest the lung slices.\n        \n            Open the insert frame and remove the membrane with the slice on it\n            using tweezers (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A and 8B).\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2674-Fig8.jpg\n                  Figure 8. Harvesting the lung slices\n                \n(A) Open the frame using round-tipped tweezers.\n(B) Peel off the membrane with the slice carefully.\n                  (C) Trim the membrane with scissors to fit the diameter of the\n                  test tube, avoiding the slice.\n                \n(D and E) Soak the membrane in RLT buffer.",
    "(F) Scrape the slice from the membrane using a 200 μL pipette\n                  tip.\n                \n            Holding the membrane with the tweezers, trim the membrane with\n            scissors to fit the diameter of the 1.5 mL tube containing RLT\n            buffer (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C).\n          \n            Soak the membrane into the RLT (Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]D and\n            8E).\n          \n            Scrape off the slices using a 200 μL tip so that they float in the\n            RLT (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]F).\n          \nCritical: Perform these steps quickly\n      in move to prevent them from drying out.\n    \nAlternatives: If using a\n      commercial insert, cut out the portion of the membrane on which the slices\n      are located and lyse them in the same manner as above.\n    \n        Homogenize the slices well by pushing and turning the pestle supplied\n        with BioMasher II approximately 30–50 times (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2674-Fig9.jpg\n              Figure 9. Homogenization of the harvested lung slices\n            \n              Push the pestle downward (1) and turn (2) to homogenize. Repeat\n              steps 1 and 2 about 30–50 times.\n            \nStore the lysate samples at −80°C until the RNA extraction step.\n        Repeat this step every 6 h until all time-point samples have been\n        collected.\n      \nPause point: Lysates can be stored\n      long-term at −80°C.\n    \nRNA extraction and cDNA synthesis\nTiming: 1–2 days\n      In the steps below, RNA is extracted from the lung lysate using an RNeasy\n      Mini Kit (Qiagen) and complementary DNA (cDNA) is synthesized using a High\n      Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n    \n        To homogenize lung tissue completely, put the lysate prepared at the\n        respective time points through a QIAshredder (Qiagen).\n      \n        Extract RNA using the RNeasy Mini kit following the manufacturer’s\n        instructions (RNeasy Mini Handbook - (EN) - QIAGEN).\n      \n        Measure the concentration of extracted RNA in a spectrophotometer.\n      \n        Perform reverse transcription to prepare complementary DNA (cDNA) using\n        1.5 μg of purified RNA obtained as described above. The reaction",
    "solution composition and conditions follow the manufacturer’s protocol\n        (Document Connect (thermofisher.com[href=http://thermofisher.com])).\n      \nReal-time quantitative PCR\n      This section describes the measurement of mRNA levels. The standard curve\n      method is applied in this protocol, so a cDNA solution for standards and\n      no-template control (NTC) are required. In addition, to confirm reaction\n      specificity, this protocol also applies dissociation curve analysis after\n      amplification (See Equipment setup for RT-q PCR).\n    \n        Prepare the diluted cDNA samples and standards.\n        \n            Dilute the cDNA 5-fold by adding 80 μL dH2O since the\n            total volume of the solution for the reverse transcription reaction\n            described above is 20 μL.\n          \n            Dilute a known amount of vector cloning the cDNA of clock genes for\n            standards. To ensure thorough and even coverage of your\n            quantification range, sufficient dilutions should be prepared to\n            cover the expected range of expression within your samples. In this\n            protocol, we usually prepare a 5-point 10-fold serial standard with\n            a range from 5 fg/μL to 50 pg/μL. For 18S-rRNA, the range is 50\n            fg/μL to 500 pg/μL.\n          \n        Prepare the master mix for PCR reactions on ice by referring to the\n        recipe in the materials and equipment section. See Table Sequences of\n        primers used for real-time PCR.\n      \nCritical: When calculating the master\n      mix volume, ensure inclusion of the number of standards and NTC.\n    \n        Dispense 20 μL of the master mix into each well of a 96-plate, add 5 μL\n        of diluted cDNA, and mix well by pipetting on ice.\n      \nNote: Use 96-well plates and lids that are\n      appropriate for the real-time PCR equipment you use.\n    \nCritical: Do not allow the formation\n      of bubbles in the reaction solution on pipetting.\n    \nCritical: After the cDNA addition of\n      all samples is completed, check the wells for bubbles. Bubbles on the\n      surface are no problem, but if bubbles occur in the liquid, move them to",
    "the surface by lightly tapping the bottom of the well.\n    \n        When the plate is ready, seal it and set it in the real-time PCR\n        detection system.\n      \n        Run the RT-qPCR reaction. The equipment setup for RT-qPCR is described\n        in the materials and equipment section."
