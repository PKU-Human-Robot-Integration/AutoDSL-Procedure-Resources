    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPurification of BTV from infected cells\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section describes the detailed protocol for BTV purification from infected BHK-21 cells. BTV is a non-enveloped virus with three layers of capsid proteins: VP2 and VP5 on the outer layer, VP7 in the intermediate layer and VP3 in the inner layer. The infectious virion, which contains all three layers of capsid proteins, is unstable and prone to losing the outer layer proteins during purification. For this reason, the purification steps here are optimized to keep the virion intact.\n10 T175 flasks of BHK-21 cells are maintained till 90% confluence. Change the medium with 35 mL fresh DMEM with FBS and antibiotics (penicillin at 100 U/mL and streptomycin at 100 μg/mL).\nAdd 5 mL of BTV stocks into each flask. Shake the flasks gently to mix the virus.\nNote: BTV1 stocks are prepared from the medium of BHK-21 cells 72 h post infection and maintained in the lab. Alternatively, BTV10 from ATCC (VR-187) can also be used. Aliquot the medium containing the virus and store at −80°C. Frequent freezing and thawing of the stock will reduce the infectivity of BTV. Among the same batch of virus, infectivity is similar. For different batches of virus stock, the volume added into each flask must be optimized.\nAlternatives: The titer of virus stock can be measured by a plaque assay (Baer and Kehn-Hall, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The titer of virus we used is around 1.5× 105/mL. Use the same multiplicity of infection (MOI) each time (about 0.03 MOI).",
    "Set the flasks in the incubator for about 70 h. Observe the infected cells frequently 48 h post infection. Infected cells will change to a round shape in comparison to the polygonal shape of uninfected cells. The ratio of infected cells will increase over time. About 70 h post infection, the ratio reaches 80%, at which point cells should be harvested.\nDiscard the media and add 1.5 mL pre-chilled lysis buffer into each flask. Collect the cells by using a cell scraper. Combine all cells into a 50 mL tube and add lysis buffer to reach a total volume of 20 mL.\nPipet the sample up and down several times to separate the cells. Keep the sample on ice for 15 min.\nCentrifuge the resulting cell lysate at 2,000 × g for 10 min to pellet cell nuclei.\nLoad the supernatant, which contains intact virions released from the cells, onto a double cushion with 4 mL 66% (w/w) sucrose buffer on the bottom and 10 mL 50% (w/v) sucrose buffer on the top.\nCentrifuge the sample at 100,000×g using an SW28 rotor for 1 h at 4°C.\nRemove the sample above the virus band and collect the band at the interface of the two sucrose cushions and dilute 10 times to 10 mL in 20 mMTris-HCl (pH 8.8).\nNote: Use a flashlight to direct the position detection of the band (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Carefully remove the sample above the band and collect the band with a 1 mL pipet. The collected volume of the band should be less than 1 mL to avoid high concentration of sucrose in the sample after 10× dilution. If the collected volume is more that 1 mL, then dilute the sample to 20 mL and use 2 tubes to pellet the virus in step 12.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2147-Fig1.jpg",

Grids with 10 nm gold beads are used for cryoET.\nPipet the sample several times to separate the virus aggregation after adding N-Lauroylsarcosine sodium salt to a final concentration of 0.1% and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nNote: N-Lauroylsarcosine is a detergent used to reduce virus aggregation. The final concentration of N-Lauroylsarcosine, sample incubation time and temperature are optimized.\nClarify the sample by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min.\nAdd 1 mL 30% (w/v) sucrose to the bottom of a new SW41 tube, slowly layer the supernatant from step 11 on the top of the 30% sucrose and pellet the sample at 80,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C in an SW41 Ti rotor.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 20 μL of 20 mMTris-HCl pH 8.8.",
    "Note: Outer layer proteins of BTV (VP2 and VP5) are prone to detaching from the capsid, resulting in virus core particles as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. Check the quality of the purified virus through negative stain and cryoEM. Intact virions of BTV (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) differ from core particles (diameter of virion is 88 nm while diameter of core particle is 68 nm). Concentration of the virus is estimated by EM. The concentration is sufficient if there are more than 5 particles in each image.\nLiposome preparation\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section describes the detailed protocol for preparing liposomes which mimic the membrane of the late endosome. Lipid compositions are selected according to the composition of the late endosomal membrane. Lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) is a lipid specific to the late endosome and crucial for BTV membrane penetration.\nPrepare lipids for cryoEM from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), cholesterol and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) in a molar ratio of 50:20:15:15.\nDissolve all lipids in chloroform at concentration of 25 mg/mL. The four lipids (DOPC 100 μL, DOPE 40 μL, cholesterol 30 μL and LBPA 30 μL) are mixed in a glass vial using glass syringes.\nSlowly evaporate the chloroform under a nitrogen gas flow in a laboratory fume hood. Remaining traces of the solvent are removed by placing the glass vial in a vacuum desiccator for 3 h.\nHydrate the dried lipids in 250 μL liposome buffer. After pipetting for several times, transfer sample to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nFreeze-thaw the mixture 5 times in liquid nitrogen and then extrude it 21 times through a 0.2 μm polycarbonate membrane filter by using a Mini Extruder (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: Different sizes of the polycarbonate membrane filter can be used to generate different sizes of liposomes.\nStore liposomes at 4°C and use within one week.",
    "CryoEM sample preparation and data collection\nTiming: 2–4 days\nThis section describes the detailed protocol for cryoEM grids preparation and data collection for both cryoEM and cryoET. Briefly, the purified virus is applied to a thin continuous carbon film coated lacey grid, followed by incubation with liposomes at pH 5.5 on the grid. The grid is then blotted and plunge frozen in liquid ethane. To investigate the interaction between BTV and liposomes, both methods of cryoEM and cryoET are used. By cryoEM and single-particle reconstruction, high resolution structure of BTV can provide detailed information of conformational changes at low pH. By cryoET, we can observe the direct interactions between the long flexible stalk of BTV with the liposomal membrane.\nGlow discharge the thin continuous carbon film coated lacey grids in an easiGlow machine for 1 min.\nAdd sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5) to final concentration of 100 mM to titrate the liposome to pH 5.5.\nApply 2 μL of the purified BTVvirion to a glow discharged grid and incubate for 1 min.\nBlot the grid manually with a filter paper to remove most of the virus and add 2.5 μL of the acidified liposomes to the grid.\nMount the grid into the Vitrobot. After incubation for another 30 s, blot the grid for 20 s at 8°C with 15 blot force and 100% humidity and plunge-freeze in liquid ethane by using a Vitrobot Mark IV.\nNote: The Vitrobot is turned on and the temperature and humidity are set to 8°C and 100%, respectively. Wait for the saturation of blot paper for 20 min prior to use. Virus will have conformational changes at low pH and easy to form aggregation. It is critical to apply virus to the grid before adding liposomes.",
    "Note: For grids of cryoET at low pH (pH 5.5), prepare grids in the same way except for mixing the liposomes with 10 nm gold beads before being applied to the grid (Figures1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nCheck the quality of the grid by a TF20 microscope. Freezing conditions need to be optimized if the grids are not of high quality.\nNote: Quality of the grid is estimated from aspects of ice thickness, virus concentration, and interaction between the viruses and the liposomes. If the ice on the grid is too thick, increase the blot time and blot force. If virus concentration is low, you need to purify the sample again (repeat steps 1–13). If no interactions between the virus and liposomes are observed, incubate the virus and liposome for a longer time in step 24.\nPausepoint: Freeze the rest of the virus sample with the same condition. The grids can be stored in liquid nitrogen for a long time before data collection.\nLoad the optimized grids to a Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a Gatan imaging filter (GIF) Quantum LS and a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector. The microscope is operated at 300 kV in super-resolution mode.\nAlign the microscope carefully (Herzik, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and set up the data collection condition in SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nCreate a full map of the grid at magnification of 135× in search mode (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). Select the squares with proper ice thickness and take a medium magnification map at 4800× for each square. In the medium magnification map, virus particles are visible (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C–2F).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2147-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Data collection process on Titan Krios\n(A) Low magnification map of the grid used for data collection. Blue boxes in the image indicate squares with proper ice thickness selected for data collection.",

Viruses and liposomes are visible at this magnification.\nCritical: Ice thickness of the area used in data collocation is one of the key factors that determines the quality of the collected images. Images from area of thick ice (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2D) have low contrast and cannot be used for high-resolution reconstruction. Ice thickness of the grid can be reduced by increase the blot time and blot force at step 24.\nRecord movies at high magnification on the selected targets which contain virus particles.\nFor single-particle reconstruction, movies are recorded at a nominal magnification of 105,000×, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 0.68 Å on the specimen level in super-resolution mode. Defocus is set to -1.8 to -2.6 μm. The total exposure time for each movie is set to 8 s, fractionated equally into 40 frames, leading to a total dosage of 40–50 electrons/Å2 on the specimen.\nFor cryoET, tilt series are collected at a nominal magnification of 53,000×, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.276 Å on the specimen level in super-resolution mode. Tilt series between −60° and +60° with a tilt increment of 3° are acquired at selected positions using a grouped dose-symmetric tilt scheme in serialEM. A movie of 8–10 frames is recorded at each tilt angle and the cumulative dosage on the specimen for a tilt series is about 120 electrons/Å2. Defocus is set to -3 to -4.5 μm.",
    "Note: If you collect data in a microscope with different configurations, you may have to use different microscope settings. Also, as the K3 camera has better performance and is faster than the K2, exposure time can be decreased when using a K3 camera. Please work with your facility manager to determine the microscope settings.\nSingle-particle cryoEM reconstruction\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis section describes the detailed protocol for single-particle reconstruction and sub-particle reconstruction of BTV virus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Icosahedral-reconstruction-guided sub-particle reconstruction is necessary for this data set to get high resolution structures of BTV in different intermediate states at low pH. After particle picking and extraction, the 3D reconstruction can be divided into four steps as detailed below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2147-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Each movie is motion-corrected (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and binned 2× to a pixel size of 1.36 Å by MotionCorr2 (Zhenget al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]), yielding two micrographs: a dose-unweighted micrograph (used for manually screening, particle picking and defocus determination) and a dose-weighted micrograph (for particles extraction and final reconstructions).\nIn our case, 3,609 good images are selected from a total number of 3,961 through manual screening.\nNote: For virus with icosahedral symmetry, 10,000–20,000 virus particles are sufficient for atomic resolution reconstruction if the images collected are of high quality. How many images you need is dependent on the virus concentration.\nDetermine the defocus values of the micrographs by CTFFIND4 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nPick the virus particles by ETHAN (Kiviojaet al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and then manually check to add the particles near the edges of image.\nNote: ETHAN is a particle picking software specific for spherical particles. The only parameter needed for particle picking is the particle radius in pixels.\nAlternatives: Topaz, a neuron network-based software also works for particle picking. To use Topaz, several micrographs are manually picked, and the resulting particle coordinates are used for neuron network training. Subsequently, all the micrographs will be able to be picked by using the trained model.\nA total number of 27,138 virus particles are extracted with a box size of 768× 768 pixels and further binned to 384× 384 pixels (2.72 Å/pixel) to speed up data processing in Relion 3.1 (Scheres, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nIn the first step of 3D reconstruction, the overall structure of BTV is reconstructed by icosahedral symmetry.\nSubject the particles from step 36 into 2D classifications in Relion. Classes with high resolution features (some α helices are visible in 2D average) are selected.\nParticles selected from 2D classification are subjected to 3D classification (K=4) by using icosahedral symmetry.",
    "15,224 good particles are selected and subjected to a 3D auto-refinement with icosahedral symmetry yielding a reconstruction with a resolution of 5.44 Å (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nRe-extract the particles with a box size of 768×768 pixels (1.36 Å/pixel) by using the accurate center and orientation parameters. These viral particle images and their corresponding icosahedral-related data STAR files are used in the next step.\nIn the second step of 3D reconstruction, an icosahedral-reconstruction-guided sub-particle reconstruction workflow is used to obtain near-atomic resolution structures of VP5 at low pH (pH 5.5) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nNote: In the icosahedral reconstruction, there are two VP5trimers (VP5trimer 1 and VP5trimer 2) in each asymmetric unit (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). We used a sub-particle reconstruction method (He et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Ilcaet al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Liu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) centering on the first of the two VP5trimers. Due to the unsynchronized nature of conformational changes of different VP5trimers, even on the same BTV particle, this strategy of sub-particle reconstruction is essential for high resolution reconstruction and for different intermediate states of BTV at low pH.\nDefine the position of VP5 in the icosahedral reconstruction by using UCSF Chimera volume tracer.\nGenerate the STAR file of sub-particles by using localized reconstruction (Ilcaet al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). STAR file of icosahedral reconstruction in step 37 with 15,224 virus particles is expanded by I3 symmetry (by using relion command relion_particle_symmetry_expand)—sixty entries with different orientations for one virus particle.\nA total of 913,440 sub-particles are then extracted with a box size of 300× 300 pixels from those viral particle images.\nGenerate an initial model form the extracted particles by using relion command relion_reconstruct.",
    "Subjected the extracted particles to local refinement in Relion with map from step 38d as initial model, yielding a reconstruction with resolution of 3.2 Å. The VP2 density is visible at a lower threshold, indicating non-uniform occupancy of VP2 across different virions and/or even on the same virion.\nIn the third step of our workflow, focused 3D classification without orientation search is carried out in Relion (Scheres, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nGenerate a cylinder mask centered on VP5trimer 1.\nRun 3D classification with skip align option in Relion by asking for 5 classes. Four different states of BTV are obtained with 66,934 particles in intermediate state 1 (IMS1), 103,469 particles in intermediate state 2 (IMS2), 120,974 particles in intermediate state 3 (IMS3) and 572,331 particles in low-pH state (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nThese particles are further subjected to CTF refinement (per-particle defocus, per-micrograph astigmatism, beamtilt and high order aberrations) and 3D auto refinement, yielding four different conformations: IMS1 at 3.9 Å, IMS2 at 3.8 Å, IMS3 at 3.6 Å, and low-pH state at 3.4 Å, respectively (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nIn the final step, to improve the density quality of the VP5 stalk region in the low-pH state, we use a method by combining the signal subtraction and focused 3D classification in Relion.\nGenerate a soft mask which includes only the VP5 part. Subtract the density outside of the soft mask from low-pH state raw sub-particles 2D images by using Relion particle subtraction.\nSeveral rounds of focused 3D classification without orientation search with mask from step 40a are run (until no further improvement in the density map is observed) to sort out subtracted particles with good stalk density. In this step, 75,625 particles are finally selected.",
    "The corresponding original sub-particles without subtraction are selected in Relion and subsequently subjected to 3D auto-refinement, yielding a final reconstruction at 4.0 Å. This reconstruction is used to facilitate model building of VP5 stalk in low-pH state (Xia et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nNote: Most of the distal part of the VP5 stalk is unresolved in the sub-particle reconstruction even with further focused 3D classification, indicating the flexibility of the distal portion of the stalk. As the distal part of the VP5 stalk is important for membrane penetration, cryoET is used to investigate the interaction between VP5 and the liposomal membrane (described in the next section).\nNote: The resolutions of the cryoEM maps are estimated based on the gold-standard FSC = 0.143 criterion (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). The cryoEM maps were auto-sharpened by the relion_postprocess program in Relion (Scheres, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). The local resolution evaluations are determined by ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nThe atomic models are built according to the sharpened maps in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) and refined by real space refinement in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nFit the anchoring domain structure of VP5 at pH 8.8 (PDB3J9E) (Zhang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) into the low-pH state map (3.4 Å).\nManually adjust the model in Coot according to the density map.\nBuild the stalk of VP5 according to the low pH focus map (4 Å) with guidance from the structure of pH 8.8.\nRefine the model in real space according to the low-pH state map (3.4 Å) by Phenix (Adams et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) and validate the model by wwPDB validation server.",
    "For the model of VP5 in IMS2, the refined atomic model of low-pH state is docked into the cryoEM map first. The helices of unfurling domain in VP5 are built in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) with guidance from the structure of pH 8.8.\nCryoET and subtomogram averaging\nTiming: 1 week\nThis section describes the detailed protocol for cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). By using cryoET, we can observe the interactions between the distal part of VP5 stalk and the liposomal membrane.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2147-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

The images are binned 2× to a pixel size of 2.55 Å.\nGenerate a stack file including all the images from the same tilt series by using newstack program in IMOD (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) (Kremer et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nEstimate defocus values of aligned images in each tilt series by CTFFIND4 (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nTilt series are reconstructed with IMOD 4.9 software package (Kremer et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) by using selected gold beads. The estimated defocus value of each image is used as input for ctfphaseflip.",
    "Note: Two tomograms are generated by weighted back projection and simultaneous interactive reconstruction technique (SIRT) method, respectively. High-contrast SIRT tomograms are binned 4× (10.2 Å/pixel) by binvol program of IMOD and used for particle picking and display. For the low pH condition, a total number of 33 tomograms with good alignment and contrast are selected and further binned by 2× (5.1 Å/pixel) and 4× (10.2 Å/pixel) for further processing of subtomogram averaging.\nManually pick particles of VP5 stalks in IMOD. Each particle is represented by 2 points in a contour, with the first one for the capsid-proximal and the second one for the capsid-distal end of the stalk protruding from the virus capsid. Totals of 107 and 100 particles are picked for the membrane-free stalk and membrane-wrapped stalk, respectively.\nSub-volume averaging is performed in PEET software (Heumann et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Nicastroet al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) and 4× binned tomograms are used first. Initial orientations of particles are generated from the manually picked particles by using stalkInit.\nPerform angular search with a cylindrical mask in PEET. The volume averaged without search is used as initial model. Search ranges along x and z axes are limited to 15 degrees while search range along y axis is 360 degrees.\nThe particles from step 48 are symmetrized to C3 along the particle Y axis by using ModifyMotiveList program in IMOD.\nAlign the symmetrized particles with a finer range till converge. Search ranges along x and z axes are limited to 9 degrees while search range along y axis is 120 degrees. The search ranges are decreased each round.\nThe refinement is then upgraded to 2× binned tomograms with model files and corresponding motive list files resampled from 4× binning to 2× binning. Run alignment again until convergence (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–4F).",
    "Calculate the resolutions of the subtomogram average by calcFSC in PEET(Nicastroet al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). The resolution of membrane-free stalk and membrane-wrapped stalk is 24 Å and 27 Å, respectively, based on the 0.143 FSCcriterion (Xia et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nAlternatives: Relion 4.0 with subtomogram averaging has been released recently. To improve the resolution, shift and rotation parameters of particles from alignment in PEET can be imported into Relion for further refinement."
