    "Ethics Statement: To protect the rights of human subjects, blood samples were obtained following an informed consent under protocols approved by the University of Miami institutional review boards under IRB 20150020.\nNOTE: Blood to be filtered for CTC capture should be collected in an EDTA tube to prevent coagulation.\n1. Coating the Microfilter with Poly (N-iso-propylacrylamide) (PIPAAm)\nWeigh out PIPAAm to prepare a 10% w/v solution in butanol. Mix using a vortex until the solution is clear.\nCut plastic microscope slides into roughly 12 mm x 12 mm squares either with a pair of scissors or sharp blade. Alternatively use a guillotine.\n\tNOTE: These squares will serve as a holder for the filters during the spin coating process.\nUsing a sharp pair of straight edge scissors, cut the slot pore microfilter wafer into 8 mm x 8 mm squares.\nUsing a polyimide film tape secure the cut filters onto the plastic squares previously cut in step 1.3. Apply the film only to the edge and the corner of the filter so that at least 7 mm X 7 mm of filter area is un-covered by the tape.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54435/54435fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Representative Illustration of the Microfilter Set-up for PIPAAm Coating. 8 mm x 8 mm microfilter is positioned onto the 12 mm x 12 mm plastic square cut from a plastic microscope slide. Polyimide tape is used to secure the microfilter in place to spin coat the PIPAAm.Reproduced with permission from reference15.

    "Dispense enough 10% w/v PIPAAm solution (prepared in 1.1) to completely cover the microfilter surface using a standard plastic transfer pipette and start the spin coater.\nRemove the PIPAAm coated microfilter from the spin-coater after the coating process is completed. Leave the filter attached to the plastic square during storage.\n\tNOTE: The coated-filter can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 months.\n2. Assembly of Filtration Cassette with PIPAAm Coated Microfilter\nRehydrate PIPAAm coated microfilter at room temperature by placing the microfilter still secured on the plastic square into a petri dish. Add 1x PBS until the microfilter is fully submerged and let stand for 5 min.\nAfter the hydration step, release the filter from the plastic square by cutting the polyimide film tape using a pair of scissor.\n\tNOTE: Take note of which side of the filter has the PIPAAm coating.\nAssemble the microfilter into the filtration cassette, by sandwiching the microfilter between the top and bottom acrylic piece along with the 2 Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pieces acting as a gasket/seal. Clamp the acrylic cassette with clips to secure the filter and provide a tight seal.\n\tNOTE: The PIPAAm coating should be facing upwards, so as the sample is filtered through, the cells will be captured on PIPAAm coated surface of the filter (Figure 1).\n3. Filtration of Blood Sample with Capture and Release of CTC from the Microfilter\nAs each syringe pump brand has its own user interface, refer to the user manual of the pump and program the syringe pump to flow at a rate of 75ml/hr and set the volume to 20 ml.\nWarm 3 ml of McCoy's (commercially available) cell culture media (prepared by adding in 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% Penicillin and Streptomycin) to 37 °C.",
    "NOTE: The media choice will be based on the patient's cancer type or else if this is a model system experiment where cultured cells are to be spiked into healthy donor blood, use the media the cells are normally cultured in. If unsure, please refer to culturing guide/method provided by the company the cells were purchased from.\nAdd 7.5 ml of commercially available Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) to the 7.5 ml of blood sample and aspirate this diluted blood into a 25 ml syringe.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the volume of HBSS so that the blood sample is diluted with equal volume of 1:1 with HBSS. E.g. if 10 ml of blood is used, then mix with equal volume of 10 ml HBSS to achieve the 1:1 dilution.\nEngage the filtration cassette with the syringe and place it onto the syringe pump. Place a 50 ml tube at bottom to collect the flow through and start the pump.\n\tNOTE: The filtration should take roughly 10- 12 min. All filtration steps are to be carried out at Normal Room Temperature (20-25 °C) including step 3.8\nAfter filtration is complete, disengage the filtration cassette taking note which side is the top that has the cells caught on the PIPAAm-coated surface. Aspirate 1 ml of the warm culture media into a new syringe.\nRe-engage the filtration cassette with the syringe containing the media, but at this time engage the bottom end of the cassette so that the PIPAAm coated-surface of the filter is facing away from the syringe.\n\tNOTE: This will be to release any cells that may be embedded into the slot pores by applying gentle reverse flow.",
    "Place the syringe back onto the syringe pump and hold a small petri dish or 6-well plate right under the filtration cassette. Set the flow rate to 100 ml/hr and start the pump.\nPass all the media through the filter and collect the flow-through in the petri dish. Wait for all the media to pass through and then stop the pump and remove the syringe and filtration cassette from the pump.\nDisengage the filtration cassette from the syringe and open it to retrieve the filter from the cassette. Place the filter with the PIPAAm surface facing down into the same petri dish used to collect the reverse flow when releasing the cells from the pores. Add the rest of the warm media and place the petri dish into a culture incubator set at 37 °C.\nAfter 30 min all the cells will be released from the filter. However, leave filter in the petri dish for up to 24 hours to ensure all cells detach.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the released cells can be collected into a microcentrifuge tube to perform further downstream analysis such as PCR, ELISA, Western Blot to name a few examples.\nAfter 24 hr in culture, carefully remove the microfilter using forceps.\n\tNOTE: The filter can be discarded at this time as the cells have been released from it.\nGently pipette the culture medium up and down using a 1,000 µl pipette, to re-suspend the erythrocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) that are caught on the filter and released into the plate with the CTC. Perform this action carefully and gently to avoid detaching the loosely-attached cancer cells. Carefully remove the entire medium containing the re-suspended erythrocytes and PBMC while leaving behind the attached-cancer cells and substitute with fresh medium pre-warmed to 37 °C.",
    "NOTE: This step can be repeated once if excessive erythrocytes are present after one wash.\n4. CTC Viability Evaluation\nEvaluate cultured CTC viability using a Live/Dead Assay8.\n\tNOTE: Numerous Live/Dead assays are available commercially. Following the manufacturer's protocol is highly advised. Please refer to the materials/reagents list for the commercial assay kit used for this experiment.\nSubscription Required.
