    "1. Substrate Preparation\nNOTE: RNA substrates shorter than ~65 nucleotides can be synthesized chemically with biotin (B) and the photo-cleavable (pc) linker (together referred to as photo-cleavable biotin or pcB) covalently attached to the RNA 5’ end (cis configuration). RNA substrates containing significantly longer binding sites need to be generated in vitro by T7 (or SP6) transcription and subsequently annealed to a short complementary adaptor oligonucleotide containing pcB moiety at the 5’ end (trans configuration) (Figure 1).\nFor binding sites consisting of fewer than ~65 nucleotides, use a commercial manufacturer (Table of Materials) to chemically synthesize RNA of interest with pcB covalently attached to the RNA 5’ end (Figure 1A and Figure 2A). Dissolve in sterile water to achieve desired concentration and store in small aliquots at -80 °C.\nFor binding sites significantly longer than ~65 nucleotides, form a partial duplex of an in vitro generated RNA of interest and a complementary adaptor oligonucleotide containing the pcB moiety at the 5’ end (Figure 3A).\n\t\nPerform T7 transcription on either a linearized plasmid DNA or an appropriate PCR template to generate RNA with the binding site of interest extended at the 3’ end by a ~20-nucleotide arbitrary sequence.\nUse a commercial manufacturer (Table of Materials) to chemically synthesize an adaptor oligonucleotide that is complementary to the 3’ extension in the T7-generated RNA and contains pcB at the 5’ end (Figure 3A).\n\t\tNOTE: Two 18-atom spacers and 2-3 non-complementary nucleotides can be placed at the 5’ end of the oligonucleotide to reduce potential steric hindrance between the bound complex and streptavidin beads. It is also desirable that the oligonucleotide is uniformly modified with a 2’O-methyl group to enhance the strength of the duplex and to provide resistance against various nucleases.\nAnneal the T7-generated RNA to the pcB adaptor oligonucleotide.",
    "Mix 20 pmol of the RNA and 100 pmol of the adaptor pcB oligonucleotide (1:5 molar ratio) in a 1.5 mL tube containing 100 µL of binding buffer with the following composition: 75 mM KCl, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is important to use a minimal amount of the adaptor oligonucleotide that is sufficient to form a duplex with most (if not all) pre-mRNA substrate used in the annealing reaction. This could be conveniently determined by labeling RNA substrate at the 5’ end with 32P, annealing the labeled substrate with increasing amounts of the adaptor oligonucleotide using various buffer conditions and monitoring the retention of the radioactive signal on streptavidin beads after several washes of the beads with the binding buffer.\nPlace the tube in boiling water for 5 min.\nAllow the water to cool down to room temperature.\n2. Complex Assembly\nSupplement 1 mL of a mouse nuclear extract (or another extract of choice) with 80 mM EDTA pH 8 to a final concentration of 10 mM to block nonspecific metal-dependent nucleases that are present in the extract.\n\tNOTE: This will result in adjusting buffer in the extract to the same composition as that in the binding buffer (see Step 1.2.3.1). EDTA does not affect in vitro processing of histone pre-mRNAs but may be harmful in purifying proteins or protein complexes that assemble in a magnesium-dependent manner. In these cases, EDTA should be avoided.\nAdd 5-10 pmol of the RNA substrate tagged with the pcB moiety in cis (see Step 1.1) or trans (see Step 1.2.3.3) to 1 mL of the extract containing 10 mM EDTA.",
    "NOTE: The amount of RNA needs to be carefully evaluated in a series of trial experiments. Using too much RNA substrate for the purification of a limiting complex maybe counterproductive, significantly increasing the background of nonspecific RNA binding proteins without having any effect on the yield of specific proteins.\nIncubate the RNA substrate with the extract for 5 min on ice, occasionally mixing the sample.\n\tNOTE: Both the time and temperature of the incubation need to be established empirically and may vary significantly, depending on the specific nature of the RNA/protein complex.\nSpin the incubation mixture in a pre-cooled microcentrifuge for 10 min at 10,000 x g to remove any potential precipitates and carefully collect the supernatant avoiding transferring the pellet.\n3. Immobilization of the RNA/protein Complexes on Streptavidin Beads.\nTransfer ~100 µL of streptavidin agarose bead suspension from a commercial supplier (Table of Materials) to a 1.5 mL tube and increase the volume with the binding buffer (75 mM KCl, 15 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 15% glycerol, 10 mM EDTA).\n\tNOTE: This buffer should have the same composition as that in the annealing mixture and in the extract used for complex assembly (Step 2.1).\nCollect the beads at the bottom of the tube by spinning for 2-3 min at 25 x g and aspirate the supernatant.\nRepeat the same washing/spinning procedure 2-3 times to equilibrate the beads with the binding buffer.\n\tNOTE: At the end of this step, the pellet of the beads should have a volume of ~ 30 µL.\nLoad the supernatant containing the assembled complex (Step 2.4) over the equilibrated streptavidin agarose beads.\nRotate 1 h at 4 °C to immobilize RNA and the bound complexes on the beads.",
    "Collect the beads at the bottom of the tube by spinning for 2-3 min at 25 x g.\n\tNOTE: Use a swing out rotor to avoid substantial loss of the beads if they tend to adhere to the side of the tube in angular rotors.\nAspirate the supernatant and rinse the beads twice with 1 mL of the binding buffer, using the same centrifugation conditions.\nAdd 1 mL of the binding buffer and rotate the sample 1 h at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: This step can be shortened if the complex formed on the substrate tends to dissociate.\nSpin down the beads for 2-3 min at 25 x g, add 1 mL of the buffer and transfer the suspension to a new tube.\nRotate for an additional 1 h or shorter, if the complex is not stable, spin down for 2-3 min at 25 x g and transfer the beads to a 500 µL tube in 200 µL of binding buffer.\n4. UV-Elution.\nTurn on a high intensity UV lamp emitting 365 nm UV light for 5-10 min before reaching full brilliance.\n\tNOTE: This is essential to achieve maximum energy of UV emission at the start of irradiation.\nFill up the bottom of a Petri dish (100 mm x 15 mm) with tightly packed ice and stack it over the dish’s lid.\nBriefly vortex the tube containing the immobilized complex, place it horizontally on ice and cover with the pre-warmed lamp, ensuring that the sample is located within the distance of 2-3 cm of the surface of the bulb.\n\tNOTE: If the distance is too large, use additional Petri dishes or other suitable objects to bring the sample closer to the bulb.",
    "Irradiate for a total of 30 min, frequently inverting and vortexing the tube to ensure uniform exposure of the suspension to UV and to prevent overheating.\n\tNOTE: To provide additional cooling, the UV-elution step can be carried out in a cold room. Switch to a Petri dish with fresh ice in case of excessive ice melting.\nSpin down the beads for 2-3 min at 25 x g and collect the supernatant.\nRe-spin the supernatant using the same conditions and collect the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: Leave a small amount of supernatant at the bottom to avoid transferring residual beads.\n5. Sample Analysis by Silver Staining Followed by Mass Spectrometry.\nUse SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate a fraction of the UV-eluted supernatant and the same fraction of the material left on the beads following UV elution.\n\tNOTE: The analysis may also include an aliquot of the beads withdrawn from the sample before UV-elution.\nStain the gel containing separated proteins using a commercially available silver staining kit.\nEvaluate the efficiency of UV-elution by comparing the intensities of proteins present in the UV-eluted supernatant and those left on the beads following UV-irradiation.\nExcise the protein bands of interest and determine their identities by mass spectrometry using standard protocols10,15.\n6. Global Analysis of UV-eluted Sample by Mass Spectrometry.\nDirectly analyze a fraction of the UV-eluted supernatant by mass spectrometry to determine the entire proteome of the purified material in an unbiased manner.\n\tNOTE: This can be done by in-solution treatment of the purified samples with trypsin followed by standard mass spectrometry protocols to determine the identity of the generate peptides10,15.\nSubscription Required.
