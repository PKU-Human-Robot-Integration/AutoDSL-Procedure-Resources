    "Wash the seeds in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes with 1 ml of the sterilization solution, shake in a benchtop block shaker at 300 rpm for 6 min at room temperature. Allow seeds to set in the bottom of the Eppendorf and remove supernatant. Wash with 1 ml of sterile water, 5 times for 5 min in the shaker. After the final wash, remove supernatant and dry overnight in the closed sterile hood, leaving the tubes open.Note: Sterilize approximately 200 seeds per genotype and treatment. All subsequent steps involving seed or plantlet manipulation should be carried in the sterile hood.Plate seeds on 200 x 15 mm petri dishes with growth medium (≈ 75 to 100 per plate and 2 plates per genotype and treatment), using flame-sterilized and cooled forceps. Stratify in the dark (in a box or wrapped in aluminum foil) at 4 °C for 2 to 4 days and transfer to the growth chambers with illumination.Note: Any other sterile plating techniques are suitable.TreatmentsBleocin and mitomycin C: Grow plants until day 7. Add 10 ml of drug-free liquid media, or media with 0.1 μg/ml of bleocin or 10 μg/ml of mitomycin C. Seal with parafilm and return to normal growth conditions until analysis. Shaking is not necessary.Note: Grow until day 7 = 7 days after transfer to the growth chambers.Hydroxyurea: Plate seeds on solid growth plates, without or with 1 mM of the chemical, and grow at standard conditions until analysis.UV-C: Grow seedlings until day 4 of growth and treat with 8 kJ/m2 UV-C in a Stratalinker. Return to standard conditions until analysis. Note: Before the treatment sterilize the interior of the Stratalinker with 70% Ethanol and run it for 3 min with the maximum dose of UV-C. Then place plates inside and remove the lid, keeping it inside the Stratalinker.",
    "Quickly close the door, to avoid contamination, and run the desired dosage of UV-C. When the treatment is finished close the plates still inside the Stratalinker and return them to normal growth conditions.GUS histochemical assayWith forceps, carefully collect the 12-day-old plants of each plate in 15 ml Falcon tubes and submerge them in 10 ml of GUS staining solution. Be careful not to break the roots, cotyledons or leafs. Vacuum infiltrate for 15 min and incubate overnight at 37 °C.De-stain the plants in 70% ethanol overnight at 37 °C. Continue to change the ethanol twice a day until most plants tissue is white. Under a stereomicroscope score the number of GUS positive blue sectors indicating recombination events per whole plant (Figure 1B). To analyze the data, generate histograms with the frequency of seedlings with different numbers of blue sectors, and the total frequency in each line and treatment (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140328/20140328223947_5370.jpgFigure 1. Principle of the assay. (A) Recombination substrates in reporter lines for SHR DGU.US-1 and IU.GUS-8 (adapted from Reference 2). These lines were designed to distinguish different somatic recombination pathways (single-strand annealing and synthesis-dependent strand annealing) upon DSB repair after expression of the endonuclease I-SceI (Orel et al., 2003; for more information about different SHR pathways see Reference 1). However, they are used here to measure SHR without I-SceI but after different exogenous DNA damage treatments. The DGU.US-1 substrate contains two fragments of the GUS ORF with homologous parts (GU, US) in direct orientation, harboring an overlap of 557 bp. In IU.GUS-8 , two fragments of the GUS ORF (“GU”, “US”; blue) in direct orientation are separated, rendering the gene not functional. A fragment of 1087 bp partially homologous to “GU” and “US”, and containing “U” is located upstream in inverted orientation.",
    "SHR events between the repeats can restore a functional gene (GUS) in different ways: in line DGU.GUS-1, the sequence in common between the two repeats is deleted, while HR between indirect repeats in IU.GUS-8 results in the restoration of the GUS gene. P: constitutive 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus; T: nopaline synthase terminator; HPT: hygromycin resistance gene, BAR: phosphinothricin acetyltransferase resistance gene, GUS: β -glucuronidase gene. (B) Histochemical GUS staining allows to visualize cells in which the GUS gene was restored by SHR (from Orel et al., 2003).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140328/20140328224002_7315.jpgFigure 2. Examples of SHR frequency measurements. Distribution of seedlings with different numbers of blue sectors and total frequency in line IU.GUS-8. (A) Mock and (B) 1 μg/ml Bleocin treatment. Sectors/plant refers to the average number of blue sectors, corresponding to recombination events, in the analyzed seedling population. Error bars correspond to the SE. SHR frequencies in each mutant population were significantly different to their wild-type (WT) counterpart, with a P value < 0.001. Asterisks indicate the significance between treated and mock populations according to P values from unpaired t tests: ***P < 0.001 and **0.001 < P < 0.01."
