    "Mouse breeding was approved by the Regierung Unterfranken, and all analyses were carried out in strict accordance with all German and European Union applicable laws and regulations concerning care and use of laboratory animals.\n1. Coating of Microtiter Plates with α4β1 Integrin for Ex Utero Allantois Explant Culture\nReconstitute the lyophilized murine α4β1 integrin at 200 µg/mL in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Dilute to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL in pre-warmed (37 °C) PBS. Pipette 20 µL/well of the diluted α4β1 integrin solution into the required number of wells of a microtiter plate (1 allantois/well).\n\tNOTE: Avoid the formation of air bubbles when coating the wells of the microtiter plate.\nIncubate the microtiter plates for 60 min at 37 °C by placing them in a humidified tissue culture incubator.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant with a pipette. Use gentle suction and incline the plate to avoid touching the well bottom with the pipette tip. Wash wells twice by adding 50 µL of pre-warmed (37 °C) culture medium such as Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), and remove the washing medium by gentle suction.\nCritical step: Block free binding sites by adding 50 µL/well of 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)/DMEM and incubate for ≥ 30 min at 37 °C by placing the microtiter plates in a humidified tissue culture incubator.\n\tNOTE: Allantois explants can attach to various surfaces in the presence of serum. It is therefore imperative to block non-specific binding sites, after coating the wells with integrin, and before adding the dissected allantois for explant culture in serum-containing medium (see step 4.4).\nKeep the coated wells in the blocking solution at 37 °C until needed in step 4.4.\n2. Uterus Dissection from a Pregnant Mouse at Dpc 8\nNOTE: Reduce false-positive pregnancy rates by weight gain discrimination15.",
    "Sacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation. Disinfect the coat in the abdominal area by spraying it with 70% (v/v) ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Wear gloves when handling mice. Euthanasia by cervical dislocation without anesthetics prevents chemical contamination of the allantois, which may interfere with allantois attachment.\nOpen the abdominal skin by making a small incision at the midline with scissors. Use gloved fingers to hold the skin above and below the incision, and pull the skin apart towards the chest and tail of the mouse.\nGrasp the peritoneum with forceps. With the other hand, make a V-shaped incision from anterior towards posterior using scissors, and move the tissue away to expose the abdominal cavity. Use the forceps to push the intestines to one side in order to gain access to the uterus.\nLocate the two uterine horns. Hold the cervix (the caudal segment) with forceps and cut the ligaments with fine scissors. Then detach both uterine horns by severing the oviducts with scissors.\nUse forceps to transfer the uterus into a sterile 10 cm dish containing sterile, room temperature (RT) PBS. Remove the adipose tissue, vessels, and nerves surrounding the uterine horns with fine forceps and/or scissors (Figure 1A).\n3. Embryo Dissection\nNOTE: Perform the following steps under a stereomicroscope equipped with an 8:1 zoom range.\nSeparate the embryos by cutting in between the implantation sites with scissors. Grasp the muscular uterine lining of the uterus buds with forceps and pull it apart to expose the decidua (Figure 1B).\nUsing forceps, transfer the uterus buds into a new 10 cm dish containing sterile, RT PBS.\nFix the decidua around the embryo with the tips of forceps.",
    "Make an incision on the anti-mesometrial side of the decidua with fine forceps (Figure 1C), and peel the decidua away with forceps to expose the embryo (Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: The mesometrial pole of the decidua is highly vascularized and can be wider at its base than the anti-mesometrial part, which contains the embryo and appears paler.\nDissect the embryo with forceps (Figure 1E, F).\nUsing a micro-spoon, transfer the embryo into a drop of sterile PBS contained in a sterile 3.5 cm dish.\nTransfer the embryo into a fresh drop of PBS in the same 3.5 cm dish using a micro-spoon, and dissect the embryo from the yolk sac using forceps (Figure 1G, H).\nOptionally, if needed (e.g., for genotyping by polymerase chain reaction), transfer the yolk sac into a sterile tube by aspirating it with ~ 5 µL PBS into a large orifice 200 µL pipette tip. Store at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: Maternal tissue (i.e., the parietal yolk sac including Reichert's membrane and the ectoplacental cone) that may contaminate the yolk sac preparation can lead to erroneous genotyping results. Removal of these tissues is easiest prior to the embryo dissection from the yolk sac.\n4. Allantois Dissection and Ex Utero Culture on Immobilized α4β1 Integrin\nCut the allantois from its basal insertion site at the posterior end of the embryo using fine forceps (Figure 1H).\nOptionally, if developmental staging is required, count the somite pairs of the embryo by visual inspection using a microscope equipped with phase contrast optics and a 5× and 10× objective.\n\tNOTE: The embryo can be extended with forceps to facilitate somite counting. Chorioallantoic attachment and fusion occur between E 8.0 and E 9.0 in embryos with ≥ 6 somite pairs. Turning begins in embryos with 6-8 somite pairs.",
    "Pipette 40 µL/well of DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, and antibiotics in the required number of pre-coated microtiter plate wells (see Section 1).\nCollect the floating allantois by aspirating it with ~ 5 µL PBS into a large orifice of a 200 µL pipette tip. Transfer 1 allantois/well.\nIncubate the allantoides by placing the microtiter plates in a humidified tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for e.g., 6, 12, and 24 h. In order to prevent interference with allantois attachment, do not move the microtiter plates in between these time points.\nAt each time point, score allantois attachment (e.g., no attachment/floating allantois; partially or fully attached allantois; fully spread allantois) using a microscope equipped with phase contrast or differential interference contrast optics and a 5× or 10× objective (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Representative examples of freshly isolated and fully attached allantoides are shown in Figure 2. Ex utero, the distal tip of allantoides isolated from wildtype C57BL/6J mice attaches within 4-6 h (this is referred to as partial attachment of the allantois), and full attachment of the entire allantois is achieved within ~ 12 h of culture. By 18-24 h, the explant has flattened and assumed a circular shape (referred to as fully spread allantois) with a CD31-positive vascular plexus9,16.\n5. Confirmatory Staining of the Explanted Allantois for the Endothelial Cell Marker CD31\nAspirate the culture medium of fully spread explants and fix the cells by adding 40 µL/well of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS.\n\tNOTE: Paraformaldehyde is toxic. Wear gloves and safety goggles to avoid skin and eye contact.\nIncubate for 10 min at RT, then aspirate the supernatant. Wash three times by adding 40 µL/well of PBS, and remove the washing medium by gentle suction.",
    "Permeabilize the cells and block non-specific binding sites by adding 40 µL/well of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100/0.1% (w/v) BSA/10% (v/v) normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at RT. Wash twice by adding 40 µL/well of PBS, and remove the washing medium by gentle suction.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused overnight at this point.\nStain cells by adding 20 µL/well of primary anti-CD31 antibodies diluted 1:50 in 0.1% (w/v) BSA/PBS overnight at 4 °C. Wash three times by adding 40 µL/well of PBS, and remove the washing medium by gentle suction.\nDetect bound primary antibodies by adding 20 µL/well of fluorescently-labeled secondary goat anti-rat antibodies diluted 1:200 in 0.1% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT. Protect microtiter plates from light by wrapping in aluminum foil or by placing in a dark chamber. Wash three times by adding 40 µL/well of PBS, and remove the washing medium by gentle suction.\nEmbed cells by adding 20 µL/well of mounting medium. Incubate for ~ 1 h at RT until the mounting medium has solidified. Store microtiter plates at RT or at 4 °C, protected from light.\nImage the vascular plexus of the allantois explants under a fluorescence microscope equipped with a 5× or 10× objective and suitable fluorescence filters.\n\tNOTE: Representative images of the CD31-positive vascular plexus of a fully spread allantois are shown in Figure 3. Other markers for the vascular plexus, such as antibodies directed against Flk-1, Flt, Tie-1 or Tie-2 can be used as well16.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
