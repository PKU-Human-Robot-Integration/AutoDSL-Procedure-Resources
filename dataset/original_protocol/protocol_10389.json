    "1. Solution Preparation\nPreparation of buffer solution:\n\t\nTo formulate buffer solution, dissolve 1 M KCl (Potassium chloride), 10 mM Tris-HCl (Tris-hydrochloride), and 1 mM EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) in distilled water and adjust pH to 8.0.\nFilter the solution using a 0.20 µm filter. To sterilize, autoclave the solution at 121 °C for 15 min.\nPreparation of lipid solution for pre-painting:\n\t\nTo formulate the lipid solution for pre-painting, dissolve 3% DPhPC (1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine) lipid (w:v) in a mixture of 2:8 n-decane and hexadecane (v:v). Stir overnight using a rotator.\nPreparation of lipid solution for membrane formation:\n\t\nTo formulate the lipid solution for membrane formation, dissolve 0.1% DPhPC (1, 2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine) lipid (w:v) in a mixture of 2:8 squalene and hexadecane (v:v). Stir overnight using a rotator.\n2. Formation of a PDMS Thin Film\nMix PDMS and curing agent in a 9:1 (w/w) ratio in a mixing cup to form the PDMS prepolymer. Add 5 g of PDMS prepolymer to a Petri dish to form the PDMS thin film (thickness 200 - 250 µm). Spread PDMS pre-polymer using a spin coater at 800 rpm for 10 sec to form a thin film.\nPlace the Petri dish into a vacuum desiccator at a pressure of 100 mTorr for 2 hr to remove air bubbles. To polymerize the pre-polymer thin film, bake in an oven for 5 hr at 70 °C.\nIn order to make a square PDMS thin film, cut the polymerized PDMS thin film into 2 x 2 cm2 squares. Use a 500 µm micro punch to make an aperture in the center of the PDMS thin film. Pre-paint apertures with 3% DPhPC lipid solution mixed in 2:8 n-decane and hexadecane.\n3. Chamber Fabrication and Assembly",
    "To fabricate the BLM chamber, design two symmetric blocks of the chamber using 3D drawing software with outer dimensions of 4 cm x 1.5 cm x 1 cm and inner-well dimensions of 1.5 cm x 1.3 cm x 0.8 cm17.\nCraft the chamber using a PTFE block with a CNC machine and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n4. Chamber Assembly\nTo assemble the chamber, place the pre-painted-PDMS thin film between the two PTFE blocks such that the aperture on the PDMS thin film is aligned with the hole in the chamber.\nSeal the outer edges of the chamber using a cover glass with grease (facilitating optical observation). Immobilize the assembled chamber using nuts and bolts.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the chamber is well-sealed so that there is no liquid leakage.\n5. Formation of Membrane Precursor with Expedited Self-assembly Formation (MPES)\nUsing a pipette, deposit 0.5 µl of 0.1% DPhPC lipid mixed in 2:8 n-decane:hexadecane onto the aperture of the PDMS thin film assembled with the chamber.\nPrior to use, store the chamber in a freezer or a refrigerator below 10 °C.\n6. Membrane Formation and Verification\nTo form a BLM with MPES, withdraw the chamber from the refrigerator and suspend 2 ml of buffer solution in each side of the chamber. Set the chamber aside for < 10 min until the frozen membrane precursor thaws.\nPlace the chamber onto a micromanipulator to precisely control the elevation with respect to the light source and the microscope. Illuminate one side of the chamber as a light source using a halogen fiber optic illuminator to brighten the aperture of the PDMS thin film for optical observation of BLM formation process.\nOn the other side, place a digital microscope vertically with respect to the light source to observe BLM formation (magnify by 200X).",
    "To confirm BLM formation, observe the center of the aperture where the color becomes brighter than the annulus.\n7. Electrical Recording\nFor electrical measurement, prepare Ag/Cl electrodes using a 208 µm-thick silver wire and bleach in sodium hypochlorite for > 1 min. Place the Ag/Cl electrodes into each side of the chamber deep enough to be dipped into the buffer solution.\nConnect the electrodes to the microelectrode amplifier. Using electrophysiology software, apply a ±10 mV triangular waveform across the membrane to acquire a square wave. Set applying voltage by clicking the arrows indicated on V_clamp (mV).\nRecord the electrical properties of the membrane by clicking the record button (red dot icon). Proceed with recording until a uniform square wave is observed. Quit the recording by clicking the black square icon.\n8. Ion Channel Incorporation\nNOTE: Gramicidin A (gA) incorporation occurs spontaneously upon formation of BLM, as gA is added directly to the lipid solution.\nTo observe gA channel activities, apply 100 mV across the membrane at a sample rate of 5 kHz to measure holding potential of the membrane. Set applying voltage by clicking the arrows indicated on V_clamp (mV).\nRecord the electrical properties of the gA incorporation by clicking the record button (red dot icon). Proceed the recording until current jumps is observed. Quit the recording by clicking the black square icon.\nAfter electrical data acquisition, filter the data with a low-pass Bessel filter at 100 Hz using an electrophysiology software.\nObserve current jumps in the filtered holding potential data (each current jump, ~0.15 nS, represents dimerization of a gA ion channel) to verify gA incorporation.\nSubscription Required.
