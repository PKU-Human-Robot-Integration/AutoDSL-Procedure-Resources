    "General cloningObtain open reading frame (ORF) clones of the proteins whose interactions will be tested in pDONR223 entry gateway vectors from the Drosophila Genomics Research Center (https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu[href=https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/]).Transform entry vector into DH5α competent bacterial cellsCentrifuge entry vector at 2,100 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.Add 20 µl of autoclaved water.Vortex for 1 min.Heat at 50 °C on a heat block for 10 min.Keep prepared DNA on ice.Add 80 µl of autoclaved water, 20 µl of 5x KCM buffer, and 1 µl of prepared DNA (above) with 100 µl of competent DH5α bacterial cells in a 1.5 ml microtube.Place tube on ice for 30 min.Heat shock cells at 42 °C by placing the tube in a water bath for 90 s. If a water bath is not available, any standard heating block will do as well.Add 500 µl of LB broth into the tube and let them recover for 1 h at 37 °C while shaking.Plate on spectinomycin selective LB agar plates.Incubate bacteria overnight at 37 °C.Make alkaline lysis minipreparations of the pDONR223 entry gateway vectorsMake a stock of spectinomycin and LB medium in a 1:1,000 ratio.Select one successfully transformed colony from the spectinomycin selective LB agar plates using a 200 µl pipet tip.Place colony in 3 ml of the spectinomycin/LB stock in a sterile 15 ml tube and pipet up and down five times to mix.Loosely cap the tube and incubate the culture overnight in a 37 °C shaker.The next day, pour 1.5 ml of the culture into a 1.5 ml microtube.Centrifuge at ~13,000 x g for 30 s at 4 °C.Discard supernatant.Add the remaining 1.5 ml of the culture into the same tube.Centrifuge at ~13,000 x g for 30 s at 4 °C.Discard supernatant.",
    "Remove all liquid from the bacterial pellet, using a pipet to aspirate any remaining liquid if necessary.Add 100 µl of ice-cold Solution 1 to the bacterial pellet in the 1.5 µl microtube.Vortex for 30 s.Add 200 µl of Solution 2.Mix the contents by inverting the tube rapidly five times. Do not vortex. Store tube on ice.Add 150 µl of ice-cold Solution 3 and invert the tube rapidly five times.Store the tube on ice for 3-5 min.Centrifuge at ~13,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Transfer supernatant to a fresh 1.5 µl microtube. Discard the pellet.Add 2 ml of 100% room-temperature ethanol and vortex for 30 s.Allow mixture to stand for 2 min at room temperature to precipitate the double-stranded DNA.Centrifuge at ~13,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and allow the pellet to air-dry for 10 min.Rinse the pellet with 1 ml of 70% ice-cold ethanol.Remove the supernatant and allow pellet to air-dry for 10 min.Dissolve the DNA pellet in 50 µl of ultra-pure water.Note: Commercial column-based kits also work for Steps A3a-A3y. Use them if available.Confirm ORF identities by Sanger sequencing using m13 primers.Perform Gateway cloning from pDONR223 entry vector to pUAS-BiFC destination vectors (Figure 2; Table 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200330/20200330080927_2257.jpgFigure 2. Gateway cloning of pDONR223 vector sequences into pUAS-BiFC vectors. pDONR223 vector confers spectinomycin resistance and contains the gene of interest between attL recombination sites. pUAS-BiFC vectors confer ampicillin resistance and contain the CcdB toxin between attB recombination sites. Recombination between the attB and attL sites mediates the transfer of the gene of interest into pUAS-BiFC.Table 1. Cloning vectors required to make BiFC transgenesimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200330/20200330081036_6203.pngAdd 75 ng of pDONR223 entry vector from minipreparations (see Step A3) and 75 ng of pUAS-BiFC destination vector to a 1.5 ml microtube.",
    "To the same tube, add TE buffer, pH 8 to 4 µl.Thaw the LR ClonaseTM II enzyme on ice for 2 min. Vortex the enzyme mix for 2 s.Add 1 µl of LR ClonaseTM II enzyme to the microtube containing the DNA mix and TE buffer. Vortex for 2 s.Incubate at 25 °C for 1 h.Add 0.5 µl of Proteinase K to the mix and vortex for 2 s.Incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.Transform pUAS-BiFC destination vectors into DH5α competent bacterial cells.Note: Procedure is identical to what has been described above with one exception: bacteria must be plated on ampicillin selective LB agar plates. Perform a midiprep of the pUAS-BiFC destination vectors from successfully transformed bacterial cells using the PureLinkTM HiPure plasmid midiprep kit.In a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 100 ml of LB medium and 100 µl of ampicillin.Select one successfully transformed colony containing pUAS-BiFC destination vector from the ampicillin-selective LB agar plates using a 200 µl pipet tip.Add colony to the LB/ampicillin mix in the 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask and pipette up and down five times to mix.Incubate overnight in a 37 °C shaker.Follow instructions as specified in the PureLinkTM HiPure plasmid midiprep kit.Resuspend the purified plasmid DNA in 100 µl of water and place in a 1.5 ml microtube. Store at -20 °C.Confirm ORF identities by Sanger sequencing using the primers in Table 2 to confirm the insert and orientation.Table 2.

We suggest outsourcing this part to a company that handles microinjections like BestGene or Genome ProLab.We suggest using the following landing sites to create transgenic fly lines:ZH-58A BDSC#244844: M[3xP3-RFP.attP]ZH-58A on the second chromosome.ZH-86Fb BDSC#24749: M[3xP3-RFP.attP]ZH-86Fb on the third chromosome.",
    "Note: It is convenient to have CYFP- and NYFP-containing transgenes on different chromosomes. To activate expression of pUAS BiFC-tagged proteins, it is necessary to incorporate a Gal4 driver.Prepare a stock of each pUAS BiFC construct crossed with a Gal4-containing line (Table 3).Table 3. Example of some suggested experimental and control experiments. We also suggest similar experiments using N-terminally-tagged proteins of interest (i.e., YFP-Protein1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200330/20200330081220_8221.pngSet the appropriate crosses to obtain both YFP halves and the Gal4 driver in a single fly. Set crosses for the necessary controls at this time.Example crossing scheme and some possibilities of combinations with controls are provided in Figure 3. We also suggest testing two proteins whose interactions are known as a positive control and for a baseline fluorescence measurement.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200330/20200330081259_5870.jpgFigure 3. Example crossing scheme. A. Establish stocks carrying versions of the proteins of interest with NYFP and CYFP tags. B. Incorporation of an indirect flight muscle specific Gal4 driver on the X chromosome. C. Use the established stock in B to test for interactions and negative controls.Dissection and imaging of indirect flight musclesCollect flies of the correct genotype.Dissect the indirect flight muscle for imaging as described previously (Xiao et al., 2017).We suggest using tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated phalloidin for actin staining.Image indirect flight muscles by confocal microscopy.Use the  Leica SP8  point-scanning confocal system. Other confocal microscopes should work as well.Image muscle fibers using the 63x/1.4 oil objective and a pinhole of 1 airy unit (AU).Initially locate the muscle fibers using brightfield to not bleach the sample.Set appropriate filters for YFP and TRITC detection.Take images at 9x magnification 1,024 x 1,024 pixels (~20 µm x ~20 µm).Sample images are provided in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200330/20200330081321_1037.jpgFigure 4.
