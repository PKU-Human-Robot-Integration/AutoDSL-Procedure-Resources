  "procedures": [
    "The L929 cell line, mouse fibroblasts, was used for the present study. The stamp-like 3D printed biodevice was obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials). Good cell culture practice and sterile techniques were followed throughout the protocol. The fabricated device was sterilized by wiping it with 70% alcohol and exposing it to UV light for 15 min. The cell culture media and solutions were warmed to 37 °C before contacting with the cells or tissue spheroids. A schematic representation of the protocol is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of non-adherent molds from the stamp-like device\nPrepare 2% (w/v) agarose gel following the steps below.\n\t\nDilute the agarose powder in phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS) and homogenize the resulting suspension with circular movements.\n\t\tNOTE: This solution can be placed in a glass bottle. In this step, the agarose solution will not be translucent.\nPlace the glass bottle into the microwave and set it for 30 s. Every 5 s, stop the microwave, remove the glass bottle, and manually homogenize the solution with circular movements. The heating process needs to be performed until the solution reaches a liquid-limpid state.\n\t\tNOTE: A hot plate can also be used as a microwave alternative. After the heating process, the solution must be translucent/limpid.\nAdd 1 mL of the agarose solution to each well of a 6-well plate planned for the experiment.\nWait for ~15 min or until the agarose solidifies.\n\t\tNOTE: A cooling plate can be used to decrease the solidification time.\nAdd 1-2 mL of the agarose solution and gently insert the device above the liquid agarose.\n\t\tNOTE: The placement of the device must be done carefully to prevent air bubbles in the agarose-device interface.\nWait for ~30 min or until the agarose solidifies.",
    "NOTE: A cooling plate can be used to decrease the solidification time.\nGently remove the device from the agarose.\n\t\tNOTE: The removal is critical. One should remove it carefully to maintain the agarose features intact; otherwise, the agarose can be disrupted.\nAdd 2 mL of DMEM media, wait for 10 min, discard the media, and replace it with fresh DMEM. Repeat this three times to wash the well properly.\nAdd 2 mL of DMEM and place the 6-well plate in an incubator (at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 80% humidity) until the cell seeding (Figure 2A-F, Supplementary Video 1).\n2. Generation of tissue spheroids\nNOTE: Different cell lineages have different adhesion properties. Hence, using this methodology, some types of cells may not form the tissue spheroids properly.\nGrow the cells following traditional monolayer culture (i.e., grow the cells in cell culture flasks using DMEM with low glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 µg/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin) (see Table of Materials). Maintain the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, and monitor until they reach 80% of confluence.\nAfter reaching the desirable confluence, wash the cells with 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to use 5 mL for 25 cm2 flasks , 10 mL for 75 cm2 flasks, and 15 mL for 150 cm2 flasks.\nAdd the dissociation enzyme and incubate the cells for 2-5 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 80% humidity.\n\tNOTE: The present study used 0.125% trypsin with 0.78 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as the dissociation enzyme (see Table of Materials).\nObserve the detachment of the cells from the cell culture flasks and add a growth medium supplemented with FBS to neutralize the cell dissociation enzyme.",
    "NOTE: For the present study, DMEM with low glucose (see Table of Materials) was used supplemented with 10% FBS.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Then, count the cells manually.\nTake 50 x 105 cells per tube and add 5 mL of 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: The number of cells seeded influences the final tissue spheroid diameter. Hence, one can increase the cell number to generate tissue spheroids with larger diameters.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant using a pipette, add 1 mL of the cell culture medium, and homogenize the solution.\n\tNOTE: In the present study, a complete culture medium of DMEM with low glucose, supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 µg/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, was used.\nRemove 2 mL of medium from the 6-well plate (step 1.1.9) and add 1 mL of the cell suspension to the center of the agarose mold formed by the 3D-printed biodevice (step 1.1.7). Wait until the cells sediment in the micro resections (~20-30 min) and carefully add 1 mL of cell culture medium into the well.\n\tNOTE: One needs to be extra careful in this step. It is recommended to gently add the medium, place the pipette tip close to the well wall, and dispense in small amounts.\nPlace the 6-well plate in the incubator (at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 80% humidity) for the tissue spheroids to form (approximately 24-48 h, depending on the cell type) (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: Different cell types (e.g., cancer cells, primary cells) have different self-assembly kinetics11.\nSubscription Required.
