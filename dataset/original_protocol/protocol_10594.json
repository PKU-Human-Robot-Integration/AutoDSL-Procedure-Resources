    "All methods described here have been approved to follow the guidelines of the Academic Research Ethics Research Committee of Waseda University. Following these guidelines, this study received an approval waiver in advance by self-check. No identifying information was collected from the participants, who were informed of the general experimental procedures and goals; each provided written consent.\n1. Preparations: Make a Squeeze Machine\nReplication of the original design\nConstruct a main body of squeeze machine with two side panels (42” x 28”) (these and all other panels are 3/4-inch-thick wooden board) to press the user, one base panel (48” x 32”), one front panel (36” x 32”), one pressure mechanical panel (36” x 28”) to mount the actuator, and an actuator to pull the side panels together (Figure 1A,B) along to the Grandin’s description.25,26\nModification from the original design\nIn place of an air cylinder actuator in the original design, adopt a motor liner actuator (Figure 1(A)).\nIn place of curved pads constructed with a 1 inch-thick wooden board and attached inside each side panel in the original design, put bead-filled cushions (Figure 1(A)).\nOmit the two padded sliding panels to grip the user’s neck.\nIn place of the controller box to open and close the side panels by means of a lever implemented, connect two control buttons to the actuator.\nInsert a microcomputer between the control buttons and the actuator, with two signal switching relays (Supplementary figure 1). Upload a program (Supplementary code 1) to modify the open and close commands as necessary.\n2. Protocol 1: Free Use of the Squeeze Machine\nStandard conditions",
    "Use more than 16 participants who are healthy adults (approximately age 18–30, regardless of gender) without the history of major illness and naïve to the experiment in order to refer to previous research15 and speaking the same native language to collect subjective report. Conduct the experiment with each participant separately.\nUpload an appropriate program (Supplementary code 1) to the microcomputer. Show the participant how to use the machine: demonstrate entering it and controlling it, without informing the participant of the purpose of the machine. Ask the participant to use it for several minutes. Inform the participant that reactions about the feeling produced by the machine are welcomed.\nAid the adjustment of the machine to enable easy entry and help fit the cushions to the participant’s preference. Check the maximum closure and ensure it is neither too tight nor too loose. Adjust the space between the two side panels using the sliding side adjusters if it needs.\nLet the participants use the machine for 5 min, recording their verbal responses. Observe to ensure nothing is going wrong with either the participant or the machine.\nAsk the participants to rate their state of relaxation on two scales from 1 to 10: the poles of the first are “very excited” and “almost asleep\",3 and the poles of the other are “not relaxed” and “relaxed.” After the participant has completed the use of the machine, ask, “How did you feel while using it?” Collect the answers as subjective reports along with what was spoken during use.\nSporadically uncontrollable conditions: Upload an appropriate program (Supplementary code 1) to the microcomputer to flip the reaction of the actuator once every two pushing control buttons by the participants, without informing them. After this, perform steps from 2.1.3 to 2.1.5.\n3. Protocol 2: PPS Measurement",
    "Set up the experimental system: In this experiment, participants are asked to immediately report when they feel a tactile stimulus from a vibration motor attached to the left index finger, which is presented with or without sound. The response times (RTs) are collected.\nPlace a speaker near the hand rest of the squeeze machine (near the speaker) and another approximately 100 cm away from the first (far the speaker). Additionally, prepare a vibration motor (approximately half an inch in length) and a push button placed near the right index finger to collect RTs (Figure 2).\nCreate two kinds of 3 s sound sources, one producing pink noise at 44.1 kHz, with an exponentially rising acoustic intensity from 55 to 70 dB Sound Pressure Level (IN-sound) and the other the opposite, with falling intensity (OUT-sound), as measuring the sound level with an audiometer at the head rest of the squeeze machine. Create the sounds as follows: make the 55 dB sound with the near speaker silent, the 70 dB sound with the far speaker silent, and intermediary sounds with a proportional mix between the speakers, to give the impression that the sound is approaching the participants from the in sound and is leaving from them to the out sound.\nCreate an experimental system that presents IN- or OUT- sounds and one tactile stimulus, as shown in Figure 3. Randomly arrange four trials for each condition (T0–T6 or no tactile stimulus with the IN- or OUT- sound, 64 trials in total) for one set.",
    "Give to the participants the following three instructions: report the timing of the tactile stimulus using the button as soon as you feel it, try to ignore the sounds, and the trial will be repeated multiple times for around six minutes. Conduct a training session with three trials to ensure that the participants understand the task.\nSqueezed conditions\nLet the participants use the machine freely for 5 min and adjust it to their comfort. Remove the control button and attach the vibration motor to the participants’ left index fingers. Then place their right index finger on the response button on the hand rest of the squeeze machine (Figure 2(A)).\nBegin one set of trials. After 3 min break, repeat step 3.2.1 and begin another.\nControl conditions\nOpen the squeeze machine entirely and remove the cushions. Instruct the participants to lie in it as if they were using the squeeze machine within the empty machine. Place a vibration motor on the participant’s left index finger, attaching it to a vibration motor, and place the right index finger on the button on the hand rest of the squeeze machine (Figure 2(B)).\nBegin one set of trials. After a 3 min break, begin another.\nData analysis\nExclude any RTs not within 150–1,000 ms which are not expected to be valid cross-modal responses.15,23 Calculate means and standard errors of RTs for all conditions.\nExpress the best-fitting sigmoidal functions with mean RTs of T1–T5 for each of the four conditions ([squeezed or control condition] x [IN- or OUT- sound]). Use a sigmoidal function described by the following equation15,27:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59263/59263eq1.jpg",
    "where x represents the independent variable (timing of T1–T5), y the dependent variable (RTs), ymin and ymax the lower and upper saturation levels of the sigmoid, xc the value of the abscissa at the central point of the sigmoid and b provides the slope of the sigmoid at xc.15,27"
