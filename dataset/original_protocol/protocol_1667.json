    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAn overview of the procedure is summarized in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. The cells are plated on Day 1 (Step 1). The samples for thiol analyses are extracted from the cells on Day 2 (steps 2–4). The samples may be stored at this point, and are spiked with internal standards, derivatized and analyzed on Day 3.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1225-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. An overview of the procedures\nDay 1: Cell seeding\nTiming: 1–2 h\nPrepare relevant growth medium using dialyzed FBS. The DMEM medium for culturing UMRC6 cells contains glutamine and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin.\nPlate 5 × 105 UMRC6 cells in a 35 mm dish at a density that will ensure ∼70–80% confluence at the time of extraction.\nNote: We recommend using dialyzed FBS-containing medium for all the relevant steps in this protocol, as this allows better control of the metabolite levels the cells are exposed to during growth and treatment phases. The protocol is optimized for adherent mammalian cells grown on 6-well plates or 35 mm dishes. 60 mm dishes have also been used successfully, but require scaling up some of the volumes.\nDay 2: Pretreatment and treatment\nTiming: 2–6 h\nFor short-term treatments (0.25 to 4-h drug treatments, for example), on the day of the experiment, the cells should be transferred into fresh medium for 1–2 h prior to beginning the treatment.\nThis controls for the nutrients that were depleted during overnight culture, as well as any waste products that may have accumulated in the medium.\nPreparation for extraction\nTiming: 0–1 h\nPrepare the extraction solution (at least 500 μL per sample).\nCool a tube of extraction solution on ice.\nCool a tube of PBS on ice (at least 1 mL per sample).\nPlace the cold block in a box or bin filled with ice.",
    "Note: If cold block is unavailable, the relevant steps can be performed on dry ice with caution.\nLabel all Eppendorf tubes.\nFor media samples, fill Eppendorf tubes with 450 μL of extraction solution.\nTrypsinize parallel plates/dishes of cells and measure the packed cell volume (PCV) using PCV measurement tubes.\nOptional: count cells.\nExtraction protocol\nTiming: 0–2 h\nMove the ice bin, DPBS, extraction solution, and media collection tubes into the TC hood.\nTransfer culture plates/dishes from incubator to TC hood.\nHarvest 50 μL media directly into media collection tubes containing extraction solution, and place on ice.\nNote: steps 14 and 15 should be performed one plate/dish at a time.\nAspirate the medium from a culture plate, then quickly add 1 mL cold DPBS and place on the cold block.\nAspirate the PBS, then quickly add 500 μL of cold extraction solution and place the plate back on the cold block.\nNote: all subsequent steps can be performed outside the TC hood\nGently rock the cold block with the plates (still on ice) for 5 min on a rocker.\nScrape each plate with a cell scraper and transfer the suspended cell debris into a labeled 2 mL Eppendorf tube on ice.\nSpin the tubes (5 min, 5000 × g, 4 C).\nTransfer the supernatants into new, labeled 2 mL tubes on ice.\nThe samples can be stored at this point at −80°C for a maximum of 48 h. The samples need to be on dry ice if they need to be shipped. Note these extracts will freeze on ice.\nDay 3: Sample derivatization\nTiming: 0.5–1 h",
    "If the samples are frozen, thaw them on ice or on a cold block at ice-cold temperatures. Alternatively, you can proceed directly to this step from sample collection. Also thaw one or more aliquots of internal standard solution on ice (10 μL per sample to be analyzed).\nLabel a fresh set of Eppendorf tubes (one per sample to be analyzed) and place them on ice to cool.\nTransfer 10 μL of internal standard solution to each of the pre-labeled tubes.\nTransfer 90 μL of extracts from the sample tubes to the corresponding reaction tubes.\nAdd 10 μL of triethylamine to each reaction tube, cap, briefly vortex to mix, and return to ice.\nCritical: Triethylamine is highly flammable, a suspected fetal toxin, an eye irritant, and is considered acutely and chronically toxic. A laboratory coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn when working with this chemical. A chemical fume hood should be used when working with this chemical.\nAdd 1 μL of benzyl chloroformate to each reaction tube, cap, briefly vortex to mix, and return to ice.\nCritical: Benzyl chloroformate is considered acutely and chronically toxic. A laboratory coat, goggles, and gloves should be worn when working with this chemical. A chemical fume hood should be used when working with this chemical.\nPlace the reaction tubes in a heating block or water bath at 37°C and incubate for 10 min.\nSpin the tubes (5 min, 16000 × g, 4°C).\nTransfer 100 μL of the derivatized samples to autosampler vials and proceed to sample analysis.\nSample analysis by LC-MS\nTiming: 0.5–1 h per sample",
    "The derivatized samples are analyzed by LC-MS. The method detailed here uses reversed-phase chromatography with a C18 column and tributylamine as an ion-pairing reagent with an Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer, but other column chemistries and mass spectrometers can be used as well. In that case you will need to develop the chromatography method and confirm separation and detection with standard solutions.\nPrepare mobile phase Solvent A as described in the “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” section.\nFill the mobile phase reservoirs of the LC pump with Solvent A and methanol.\nPurge the solvent lines of the LC pump to remove any air bubbles.\nCalibrate the mass spectrometer using negative ion calibration solution according to the manufacturer’s instruction.\nSet up the sequence to run your samples, using the injection volumes determined in the Standard curve section. Run at least one blank first to ensure the LC column is fully conditioned, and to establish baseline values.\nNote: due to the large difference in intracellular concentrations between some of these analytes, you may need to run each sample twice, with two different injection volumes, to ensure that all the analytes are within the linear range of the mass spectrometer.\nNote: see Troubleshooting section if the LC reports a high- or low-pressure error.\nOnce the sample sequence has finished, convert the Thermo data files (∗.raw) to the mzXML format (∗.mzxml) using the msConvert or msConvertGUI tools in the ProteoWizard package.\nOpen the mzXML files in the El-MAVEN software package.\nFind the peaks for the analytes of interest and their respective internal standards, and extract the peak area values to a comma-separated values (∗.csv) file.\nData analysis and quantitation\nFor each sample, determine the ratio of the unlabeled analyte peak to that of the isotope-labeled internal standard peak in that same sample.",
    "Note: if you had to run each sample twice, with different injection volumes, be sure to use only the data from the run with signals in the linear range.\nUsing the standard curve data from the Standard curves section, convert each ratio to a molar concentration. This is the concentration of the analyte in the extract.\nUsing the PCV values determined in the Preparation for extraction section, convert the extract concentrations to intracellular concentrations using the following formula:\nCcell = Cextract × 500 × PCV\nWhere Ccell is the intracellular concentration, Cextract is the extract concentration, PCV is the packed cell volume for that sample group in μL.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1225_9.csv\nNote: the linear range in the intracellular space is estimated from the linear range in extracts by assuming a packed cell volume of 5 μL. Extracting different volumes of cells may shift the range."
