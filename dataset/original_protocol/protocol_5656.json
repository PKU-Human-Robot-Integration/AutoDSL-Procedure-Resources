    "Practically, the workflow can be divided into two parts, as shown in Figure 2. The first part is to construct the reporter strain, which takes approximately 12-15 days (Steps 1-3 of the protocol). The second part is to assess the activity of DGC and PDE by the reporter strain (Steps 4-5). This will take 7-9 days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227220731_2754.jpgFigure 2. The overview of the workflow. The procedure is divided into two parts: 1) construction of the reporter strain and 2) assessment of c-di-GMP cyclase or phosphodiesterase activity by the reporter. It takes approximately 12-15 days to construct the reporter strain, and another 7-9 days to assess the target.Amplify Vc2 and lacZY by PCR:The template for the PCR is Vc2-pRS414 (kindly received from Prof. R. R. Breaker, Yale University), in which the fragment containing riboswitch along with its native promoter was cloned in frame to the lacZ reporter gene (Sudarsan et al., 2008).The primers used are:Vc2lacZY_F_PacI: GCGTTAATTAAATAACGCCTATATTTGAAAGCTTGVc2lacZY_R_NotI: GATCAGCGGCCGCTTAAGCGACTTCATTCACCTGThe restriction sites PacI and NotI are underlined. Prepare PCR reaction mix:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227221113_1710.jpgThermocycling conditions:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227221224_3997.jpgCheck the PCR products by gel electrophoresis using 1% TAE agarose gel. The expected size is 4,733 bp.Clone Vc2lacZY into pGRG25 vector:Double digest the PCR product Vc2lacZY and the plasmid pGRG25 with PacI and NotI at 37 °C overnight. To reduce star activity, it is advisable to use the fewest units possible to achieve the digestion. After digestion, it is necessary to check the size of products using agarose gel electrophoresis. The enzymes are inactivated at 65 °C for 20 min.Remove the restriction enzymes using PCR purification kit. The concentration of digested Vc2lacZY and pGRG25 are measured by NanoDrop.Ligate pGRG25 and Vc2lacZY of molar ratio 1:1 at 12 °C overnight using T4 DNA ligase following the manufacturer’s instruction. To verify that the vector is completely cut, ligate the digested vector alone.",
    "If the vector is not cut by the two restriction enzymes efficiently, re-circulation will happen and colonies will appear after transformation.Transform the ligation products into chemically competent TOP10 cells and select for the recombinant plasmids on LB agar plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The pGRG25 vector is temperature-sensitive, so the plate should be incubated at 32 °C or even lower temperature.Verify the recovered colonies by colony PCR. First, prepare the master mix for Taq DNA polymerase with standard Taq buffer (from New England Biolabs) following manufacturer’s instruction. Then 25 µl aliquots are added to the PCR tubes. Sterile pipette tips are used to pick single colonies and mix with reaction buffer. An initial 5 min denaturation at 95 °C is recommended for colony PCR with Taq DNA polymerase. The expected size is 518 bp. The primers used are:pGRG25control_F: CACTTATCTGGTTGGTCGACACTVc2lacZY_R: CTGCAAGGCGATTAAGTTGGThe details for the colony PCR can be found in the protocol by Azevedo et al. (2017).Confirm the sequence integrity of the riboswitch in the positive clones by DNA sequencing using the same primers for colony PCR.Integrate Vc2lacZY into the Tn7 attachment site of E. coli chromosome (Note 1):Streak positive colonies on LB agar plate supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubate the cells at 32 °C.Inoculate approximately 10 colonies into 3 ml of ampicillin-free LB medium at 32 °C, 200 rpm. Add 0.1% L-arabinose (w/v) to facilitate the incorporation of Vc2lacZY into E. coli Tn7 attachment site. The integration results in a new strain E. coli TOP10 attTn7::Vc2lacZY.Dilute the overnight culture by a factor of 108 and plate 50 μl of the diluted culture on LB plate to acquire single colonies. Incubate the plate at 42 °C to block the replication of the temperature-sensitive pGRG25 vector.",
    "Streak individual colonies on LB plate and repeat the incubation at 42 °C to make sure that the plasmid is lost.Confirm the integration of Vc2lacZY into the chromosome by colony PCR using Taq DNA polymerase. The primers used are:pGRGcontrol_F: GATGCTGGTGGCGAAGCTGTpGRGcontrol_R: GATGACGGTTTGTCACATGGAThe expected size for positive clone and control is 6,328 bp and 678 bp, respectively.Assess the activity of diguanylate cyclases by Vc2-based screening: take the established DGC AdrA, YdeH and STM4551 as examplesPrepare calcium chloride competent E. coli TOP10 attTn7::Vc2lacZY cells.Transform pBAD vectors (Note 2) harboring DGC (AdrA, YdeH and STM4551) and catalytically inactive mutants (STM4551E267A and YdeH-mut) as well as empty vectors into the chemically competent cells by heat shock at 42 °C for 40 sec. Add 1 ml LB medium free of antibiotics into the microcentrifuge tubes and incubate the tubes at 37 °C, 200 rpm for 1 h to let the cells recover.Plate 200 μl cells on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubate the plates at 37 °C overnight.Streak single colonies on ampicillin-containing LB agar plates.Pick one colony for each strain and culture the colony in 5 ml of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, 200 rpm overnight.Measure the OD600 of overnight culture and adjust the OD600 to 0.1.Grow cells at 37 °C, 200 rpm. When OD600 reaches 0.6-1.0, spot 3 μl culture on LB plates with the addition of 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 80 μg/ml X-gal, 0.1% (w/v) L-arabinose (Note 3). It is important that cells with DGC, corresponding mutant, and vector control have similar OD600.Incubate the plates at 28 °C and monitor the color of colonies up to 72 h. A DGC activity will lead to a white colony indicative of high c-di-GMP levels. Take pictures of the plate using a digital camera.",
    "Investigate the activity of PDE: take the established PDE STM3611 as an exampleThe intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP is low in TOP10 cells, therefore Vc2lacZY-harboring cells have a basal level of β-galactosidase activity resulting in a blue colony, which makes it impossible to distinguish the color further enhanced by phosphodiesterase. The activity of PDE can, however, be reliably investigated by co-expression of a DGC. Therefore, pWJB30 (DGC AdrA cloned into pBAD30) and pSTM3611 (PDE STM3611 cloned into pSRKGm) (Notes 2 and 4) are co-transformed into chemically competent TOP10::Vc2lacZY cells. As controls, empty vectors are co-transformed or in combination with the DGC/PDE. The combinations are listed in Table 1. Table 1. The combination of plasmids co-transformed into chemically competent TOP10::Vc2lacZY cellsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227221825_0341.jpgPlate cells on LB agar plates containing both ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and gentamicin (30 μg/ml). The plates are incubated at 37 °C overnight.Streak the positive colonies on antibiotics-containing LB agar plates.Inoculate at least three individual colonies per strain in 5 ml of LB medium containing both ampicillin and gentamicin. Grow cells at 37 °C, 200 rpm overnight.Measure OD600 of overnight culture and dilute the culture to OD600 of 0.1 with LB medium containing antibiotics. Let the cells grow to exponential phase (OD600 ~0.6). It is critical that all samples have similar OD600 values.Spot 3 μl of the cultures on LB agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), gentamicin (30 μg/ml), IPTG (0.75 mM), L-arabinose (0.003%, w/v) and X-Gal (80 μg/ml) (Note 3). Incubate the plate at 28 °C and record the color of the colonies up to 72 h. While expression of the DGC alone leads to white colonies, co-expression of an active PDE will lead to blue colonies.Take pictures of the plate using a digital camera."
