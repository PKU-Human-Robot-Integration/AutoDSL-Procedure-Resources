    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of instruments and animals\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section details the necessary pre-procedural analgesia and sterilization of the surgical instruments.\nSterilize the surgical tools in Germinator 500 Glass Bead Sterilizer (Cat# 720127) before surgery.\nNote: Clean all instruments thoroughly with an enzymatic detergent (Helizyme; Cat# 18767) after each procedure and between surgeries on different animals. Remove tissue remnants left on the surgical instruments using a soft brush.\nInject subcutaneously an analgesic buprenorphine hydrochloride (Temgesic, 0.1 mg/kg) 30 min prior to surgery.\nPause point: 30 min.\nMouse anesthesia and orotracheal intubation\nTiming: 2–3 min\nThis section encompasses anesthesia induction and orotracheal intubation in mice. After induction of anesthesia, a stable level of anesthesia is maintained for all subsequent steps of the surgical procedure.\nPlace the mouse into a transparent anesthesia induction chamber (Tabletop Laboratory Animal Anesthesia System, VetEquip, Cat# 901806) supplied with a continuous flow of isoflurane (3%–3.5% in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 1 L/min, Cat# HDG9623).\nEnsure proper depth of anesthesia by performing a toe pinch with straight forceps (Graefe Forceps, straight, Cat# 11050-10) after the animal has lost its righting reflex.\nUpon achievement of a required depth of anesthesia, take the mouse out of the box and suspend it by hooking its superior incisors over a blunt needle on the intubation stand (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].2–4.4).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3064-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Sequence of steps from mouse intubation to fixation on the surgery plate",
    "(1) Surgical stereomicroscope, customized intubation stand, and power light with flexible horns. (2, 3, 4) Suspension of the mouse over the needle of the intubation stand. (5, 6, 7) Insertion of the endotracheal tube into the mouse trachea. (8, 9) Successful insertion of the intubation tube into the mouse trachea. (10, 11) Placement of the mouse on the homeothermic plate following intubation and connection to the ventilator. (12) Fixation of the limbs to the homeothermic plate and insertion of a rectal thermal probe. (13) Shaving of the chest region. (14) Braunoderm application over the chest skin. (15) Insertion of chest retractors.\nUse a power light with flexible horns KL-200 for the insertion of the endotracheal tube.\nNote: To better visualize the vocal cords and the epiglottis of the mouse, illuminate the ventral neck of the mouse from the outside with one horn and the throat from above using another horn.\nUnder the surgical stereomicroscope at 8x magnification (Leica, M50), retract gently the tongue of the mouse to one side with a curved tweezer (Graefe Forceps, curved, Cat# 11052-10) held in the right hand, while with the left hand widen the oral cavity using a second curved tweezer (Graefe Forceps, curved, Cat# 11052-10) to visualize vocal cords and the epiglottis.\nOnce the vocal cords and the epiglottis are clearly seen, insert the endotracheal tube gently into the trachea with the right hand until the tip of the tube passes between the vocal cords and enters the trachea (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].5–4.7).\nPlace the mouse in the supine position on a homeothermic plate (AD Instruments, Cat# ML295/m). Remove the extender and connect the endotracheal tube via the Y-shaped connector to the small-animal ventilator (MiniVent type 845, Cat# 73-0044) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].10 and 4.11).",
    "Evaluate the success of the intubation by visual observation of the chest excursion synchronous with the ventilator.\nNote: Calculate the ventilation settings for a mouse using the formulas provided by the Harvard Apparatus:\nTidal volume (mL) = 0.0062 × M1.01 and ventilation rate (breaths/minutes) = 53.5 × M-0.26, where M is animal body weight in kg.\nCritical: If the abdomen becomes enlarged with each inspiration stroke, suspect an esophageal intubation. In this case, remove immediately the endotracheal tube, and repeat the intubation procedure according to steps 1‒6.\nTape the paws of the mouse down to the homeothermic plate using adhesive tapes.\nProtect the eyes of the mouse from drying by applying dexpanthenol eye ointment.\nNote: The anesthesia is maintained with isoflurane (1.5%–2% in 100% oxygen).\nThe surgical procedure of pulmonary artery banding\nTiming: 15–30 min\nThe following steps describe the technique of pulmonary artery banding in mice. Pulmonary artery banding is a surgical procedure, in which a titanium clip is placed around the pulmonary trunk to induce constriction of the pulmonary artery.\nShave the mouse chest wall and then apply Braunoderm (Cat# 3881105) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].14, 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].2a, and 5.2b).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3064-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Roadmap of key steps in the protocol for mouse pulmonary artery banding surgery",
    "(1a, 1b) Removal of chest hair. (2a, 2b) Braunoderm application over the chest skin. (3a, 3b) Skin incision on the chest. (4a, 4b) Insertion of chest retractors. (5a, 5b) Pulling of chest muscles with chest retractors. A rib (white arrow) and intercostal muscles are visible. (6a, 6b) Pulling apart the ribs with chest retractors. Adipose tissue and thymus (depicted by white arrow) are exposed. (7) Dissection of pericardial fat and connective tissues with curved Moria forceps (white arrows). (8) Isolation of the pulmonary artery using curved Moria forceps (white arrows). (9) Important intrathoracic structures: pulmonary trunk (arrow a), left atrium (arrow b), and aortic arch (arrow c). (10) Creation of a tunnel underneath the pulmonary trunk using the vessel probe (white arrow). (11) Placement of the clip around the pulmonary trunk (white arrow). (12) Closure of the chest cavity by bringing together the adjacent ribs with a suture. (13) Repositioning of the chest muscles to their physiological positions and removal of chest retractors. (14) Skin suturing.\nNote: Illuminate the surgical field with the power light with flexible horns throughout the procedure, (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].12).\nMake a transverse skin incision (≈ 5 mm) with a scalpel, 2 mm away from the left sternal border and 2 mm lower than the level of the armpit (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].3a and 5.3b).\nGently pull apart the thoracic muscles with retractors to expose the ribs (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].5a and 5.5b).\nMake a small incision with scissors (Cat# 14090-11) at the level of the second intercostal space 2–3 mm from the left sternal border to open the thoracic cavity (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].6a and 5.6b).\nInsert 3-4 retractors gently into the incision one by one subsequently pulling away to spread carefully the wound 4–5 mm in width (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].7), then fix to the plate with surgical tapes.",
    "Retract the thymus and fat out of the field of dissection.\nPull gently the pericardial sac apart using two forceps and attach to the teeth’s of the retractors. After mobilization of the pericardium, the pulmonary trunk can be visualized.\nBluntly dissect the pulmonary trunk from the aorta and left atrium using curved Moria forceps (Cat# 11370-31) by carefully disrupting connective and fatty tissues (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].8 and 5.9).\nNote: Make sure not to damage the great vessels (aorta and pulmonary trunk), the left superior vena cava, the left atrium, or the apex of the left lung when dissecting the tissues around the pulmonary trunk.\nCreate a tunnel underneath the pulmonary trunk (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].10) with an L-shaped vessel probe (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].1).\nPlace the tip of the vessel probe from the side of the pulmonary trunk closest to the infundibulum and push gently underneath the pulmonary trunk until its end appears between the pulmonary artery and aorta.\nPlace a small Hemoclip titanium ligating clip (Cat# 523735) around the pulmonary trunk with a specially adapted applier set to a width of 0.3 mm in diameter, which corresponds to approximately 65%–70% occlusion of the luminal diameter (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].11 and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3064-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Intraoperative illustration of the pulmonary artery banding\n1) chest retractors, 2) aortic arch, 3) pulmonary trunk, 4) ligating clip placed around the pulmonary trunk, 5) left atrium, 6) a schematic representation of the pulmonary trunk constriction.\nCritical: Once the clip is placed around the pulmonary trunk, inspect it to ensure that the ligating clip is constricted and placed properly around the pulmonary trunk.\nNote: For the sham operation, dissection of the pulmonary trunk is performed using the vessel probe, but a ligating clip is not placed around the pulmonary trunk.",
    "Remove the chest retractors and place the thymus back to its physiological position.\nRe-inflate the lungs by shutting off the outflow tube on the ventilator for 1–2 s using fingers.\nClose the chest cavity by bringing together the second and third ribs with a 6-0 polypropylene suture (Cat# EH7228H).\nNote: While making a knot, a slight pressure is applied on the chest with the needle holder (Cat# 12060-01) to reduce the volume of free air in the chest cavity (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].12).\nMove all muscles back to their physiological positions.\nClose the skin with 6-0 polypropylene sutures (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].13).\nTreat the surgical wound with Braunoderm (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].14).\nTurn off the isoflurane.\nPost-operative procedures and follow-up\nTiming: 3–35 days\nThis section describes procedures on postoperative care including pain control, and follow-up of mice. A proper care and monitoring of the animals after the surgery are essential for their postoperative recovery.\nRemove adhesive tapes from the paws.\nStop the ventilator temporarily to confirm whether the spontaneous breathing is resumed by checking the regular movements of the chest.\nSwitch off the ventilator once spontaneous breathing is restored and extubate the mouse.\nPlace the mouse under a heating lamp and closely monitor it for the next 4–6 h to ensure a complete recovery from the anesthesia.\nKeep the mouse in a standard rodent cage with free access to food and water.\nCritical: Provide postoperative analgesia by administration of buprenorphine hydrochloride (Temgesic, 0.1 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously) two times a day for 3–5 days."
