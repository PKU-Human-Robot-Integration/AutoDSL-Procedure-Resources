    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPlasmid cloning\nTiming: 1 week\nThe cloning is performed by DNA fragments amplification, gel extraction, Golden Gate cloning, transformation, and plasmid purification.\nPrepare the PCR reaction mix. Add primers and template into PCR reaction mix. Shock the PCR tube and mix evenly.\nSet up the PCR as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2506_7.csv\nElectrophorese the PCR products in a 1% agarose gel at 120 V about 30 min.\nImage the gel on a blue light gel imager and excise the bands of interest with a sharp blade.\nNote: When using the blue light imager, attention should be taken to protect your eyes from UV light.\nPurify the gel strips using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nMeasure/estimate the concentration of the DNA fragments by a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher).\nNote: Other nucleic acid quantitative spectrophotometers can also be used. When using Nanodrop to detect DNA concentration, the peak UV absorption A260 / A280 ratio in the resulting parameters should be between 1.8 and 2.0, and the ratio of A260 / A230 ratio should be about 2.0.\nAdd the DNA fragments and enzymes into the Golden Gate Cloning mix.\nSet up Golden Gate cloning system in PCR tubes, mix thoroughly and spin quickly by a MiniSpin Centrifuge (Eppendorf).\nSet up the Golden Gate reaction as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2506_8.csv\nAdd 2–10 μL of Golden Gate product to 100 μL DH5α Chemically Competent Cells.\nIncubate the mix on ice for 20 min.\nHeat shock cells at 42°C for 45 s, and then place on ice for 3 min.\nAdd 200 μL LB medium to cells and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nPlate cells onto LB agar plates with 100 mg/mL ampicillin (Ampicillin is the selection marker), and incubate the plates at 37°C for 14–16 h. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].",
    "Note: Ampicillin is the selection marker for the screening of positive clones.\nPick single clone into LB medium with 100 mg/mL ampicillin, and culture for 14–16 h.\nPurify plasmids from the medium using the kits following manufacturer’s recommendation.\nNote: The plasmid extracted in this step will undergo cell transfection experiments, so we used an endotoxin-free plasmid extraction kit from TIANGEN. Other brands of endotoxin-free plasmid extraction kits can also be used.\nSequence the plasmids and store the clones at −20°C.\nPause point: The plasmids can be stored at −80°C for at least one year.\nDetermine the concentrations of biotin and rapamycin\nTiming: 1–2 week\nIn this protocol, HepG2 cell line was used which supported HBV replication and is suitable for searching HBV transcription-related factors. The selection of cell lines depends on experimental purposes. It is necessary to experimentally determine the concentration and incubation time of biotin and rapamycin before the experiments. This section consists two steps: determining the treatment conditions of biotin, and determining the treatment conditions of rapamycin.\nSeed HepG2 cells into a 12-well plate at a density of 5 × 105 cells using an automatic cell counter (Bio-Rad TC20), to achieve optimal cell density (80%–90%) at the time of transfection.\nAdd the plasmid FKBP12-TurboID and lipo8000 transfection reagent into the 1.5 mL EP tube which containing Opti-MEM medium following manufacturer’s instructions, mix them gently with a pipette, incubate at room temperature for 10–20 min, and then add the mixture into cells.\nRemove the old medium and pipette 1 mL of fresh medium into cells at 12 h after transfection, and then culture the cells for another 48 h.",
    "Note: Because the transfection efficiency of HepG2 cells is relatively low, we collected the cells at 48 h after transfection, in order to increase the expression of exogenous protein. When a cell line with a high efficiency, such as HEK293 cell line, is used, cells can be collected at 24 h after transfection.\nIncubate the cells with biotin at different concentrations for various periods of time post 48 h transfection.\nCritical: The concentrations of biotin were set as follows: 0 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, and 2 mM. The time intervals were set at 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, and 240 min.\nTransfer the cells onto ice to stop the biotin labeling reaction.\nWash cells with ice-cold 1× PBS three times, 10 mL PBS each time.\nCritical: After the completion of the labeling, the cells must be transferred to ice in time to stop labeling, and the cells should be washed with cold 1× PBS immediately to minimize the background from unspecific labeling.\nAdd 200 μL cold RIPA buffer into each well, and lyse cells on ice for 20 min.\nCritical: RIPA buffer should contain protease inhibitor cocktail to minimize protein degradation.\nClarify the lysate by spinning at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and collect the supernatant into new 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes for western blotting.\nPause point: The supernatant can be stored at −80°C for weeks before proceeding to the next step.\nSeed HepG2 cells into a 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 106 cells, to achieve optimal cell density (80%–90%) at the time of transfection.\nCo-transfect the plasmids 3×FLAG-tTa-FRB and FKBP12-TurboID into HepG2 cells.",
    "Twenty-four hours post-transfection, incubate cells with rapamycin (the final concentration of 200 nM) for different periods. The time intervals were set as follows: 0 h, 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 36 h, and 48 h.\nIncubate cells with biotin (the final concentration of 500 μM) at 37°C for 1 h.\nTerminate the biotin labeling reaction by transferring the cells to ice and washing three times with ice-cold PBS.\nLyse the cells with 500 μL RIPA lysis buffer for 20 min at 4°C, and collect the cellular debris into 1.5 mL tubes.\nCritical: The RIPA lysis buffer should be cold and contain protease inhibitor cocktail. 100 mL of RIPA lysis buffer with one tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail.\nCentrifuge the lysate mixture at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and transfer the suspension to new tubes.\nPrepare streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Add 30 μL magnetic beads to each tube, wash with RIPA buffer three times, and place on ice for later use.\nCritical: Before absorbing magnetic beads, the bottle with the beads should be shaken thoroughly.\nAdd the cellular suspension into the tubes containing streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and shake the tubes on a Rotator (SI, America) overnight at 4°C.\nNote: This step is a general guideline and needs to be optimized for particular applications. In our case, all the cell lysates were added to the magnetic beads to maximize the yield, considering the low level of exogenous protein expression due to the low transfection efficiency of HepG2 cells. The amount of cell lysates can be adjusted according to the expression levels of different cell lines.\nCollect the magnetic beads with magnetic racks and then remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads twice with 800 μL RIPA buffer at 4°C, for 10 min each time.",
    "Wash the beads once with 1 M KCl and 0.1 M Na2CO3 for 10 min at 4°C, respectively.\nWash the beads once with 2 M Urea (dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.0) for 10 min at 4°C.\nAdd 50 μL loading buffer into the beads, boil the buffer at 100°C for 20 min in a water bath to elute the biotinylated proteins.\nCritical: This loading buffer should contain 20 mM DTT and 2 mM biotin, which could increase the elution efficiency of the biotinylated protein.\nCollect the elution for western blotting.\nPause point: The elution can be stored at −80°C for weeks before proceeding to the next step.\nIdentify proteins binding to the specific DNA sequence by western blot and LC-MS\nTiming: 2 days for western blot and one month for LC-MS\nAfter determining the concentration and incubation time of biotin and rapamycin, these conditions can be used to identify proteins that bind to a particular DNA sequence. It mainly includes two steps: western blot analysis for detecting biotinylated proteins, and Coomassie brilliant blue staining for LC-MS analysis.\nLoad protein samples into the lanes of the SDA-PAGE gel and electrophorese at 120 V for 90 min, or until the bromophenol blue dye reaches the gel-front.\nPrepare pre-cold 1×Transfer buffer and PVDF membrane (a pore size of 0.45 μM), and transfer protein onto PVDF membrane using wet transfer method. Electrophorese at 200 mA for 90 min at 4°C or on ice.\nCritical: The PVDF membrane should be wetted in methanol for 30 s and then soaked in the Transfer buffer. It is worth noting that methanol should be stored in a cool, ventilated room away from fire and heat source. Other transfer methods can also be used.",
    "Block the membranes in the blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature or at 4°C for 16 h.\nNote: The blocking buffer was prepared by adding 1 g of non-fat powdered milk into 20 mL of 1×TBST solution and mixing it well.\nIncubate the membrane with streptavidin-HRP antibody (1:1,000 dilution in Antibody Dilution Buffer) for 1 h at room temperature or at 4°C for 16 h.\nWash the membranes three times with TBST, 10 min for each washing.\nPrepare and add 2 mL ECL substrate (mix solution A and solution B) onto the membranes, and expose the membranes with an imaging system such as a BIO-RAD Imager (ChemiDoc Touch). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: This ECL reagent should be stored at 4°C and protected from light.\nSeed HepG2 cells into a 10-cm dish at a density of 5 × 106 cells, to achieve optimal cell density (80%–90%) at the time of transfection. Co-transfect the plasmids pTRE-pCore, 3×FLAG-tTA-FRB and FKBP12-TurboID (3 μg of each plasmid) into HepG2 cells.\nAfter 48 h, incubate the cells of the experimental group with 200 nM rapamycin for 12 h at 37°C, and incubate the cells of control group with DMSO (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nLabel proteins with 500 μM biotin for 1 h at 37°C.\nTransfer the cells to ice to stop the reaction, and wash the cells with ice-cold PBS.\nExtract and purify the biotinylated proteins following steps from 32 to 41.\nLoad the elution samples into the SDS-PAGE gels. Run the gels at 110 V when the protein maker was just separated (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2506-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Coomassie blue staining results of SDS-PAGE gel for the LC-MS analysis",
    "Critical: The electrophoresis time can vary due to the different migration rate of the protein marker on different gel concentrations. Empirically, electrophoresis can be stopped when the bromophenol blue dye is about 2–3 cm away from the interface between the concentrated and separated gel.\nPrepare Coomassie blue dye, containing 0.1% Coomassie R-250 in 40% ethanol and 10% acetic acid.\nIncubate the gels in the Coomassie dye buffer with heating in a microwave oven for 2–3 min.\nCritical: Do not overheat the staining solutions. Loosely cover the staining container.\nNote: Staining the gel for 30–60 min at room temperature is also possible. Alternatively, other staining methods are also recommended, such as Colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue or water-soluble Coomassie-based dyes.\nShake the gels for 30 min at room temperature for staining.\nPour off the dye buffer and wash the gels with distilled water twice, for 5 min each, at room temperature.\nPrepare decolorization solution which contains 7.5% acetic acid and 10% ethanol.\nCritical: Heat the gels in a microwave oven for 2–3 min for quick decolorization.\nWash the gels with decolorization solution at room temperature, repeatedly.\nShake the gels with decolorization solution until the desired background achieved.\nCut the gel strips under a white light. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nPut the gel strips in the EP tubes and send them to a service provider for LC-MS analysis. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nNote: We send our samples to Applied Protein Technologies in China for the LC-MS analysis. Any other qualified service providers, however, would be acceptable.\nAnalyze the results of LC-MS, and select the interesting protein for verification. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].",
    "Critical: Skin keratin contamination should be avoided when cutting gel strips. The operator should wear white coats, gloves, masks and hats; the strips must be cut on ultra-pure water cleaned glass panels, not randomly on plastic panels or even plastic gloves."
