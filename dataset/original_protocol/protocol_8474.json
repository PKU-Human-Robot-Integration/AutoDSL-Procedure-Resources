Store solution at 4 °C.\nKCl\nDissolve 3.7275 g of KCl in 50 mL of distilled H2O to a stock concentration of 1 M. Store solution at 4 °C.\nD-(+)-Glucose",
    "Dissolve 1.802 g of D-(+)-glucose in 50 mL of distilled H2O to a stock concentration of 100 mM. Store solution at 4 °C.\nCell Culture Media\nPrepare cell culture media as follows: 5 mL of heat inactivated dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum, 500 µL of 200 mM L-Glutamine, 100 µL of 50 mg/mL Gentamycin and 1 mL of 1.0 M KCL should be added to 45 mL of filter sterilized Eagle's minimal essential media (E-MEM) that is supplemented with 1.125 g/L D-Glucose to generate 50 mL of cerebellar granule neuron culture media. Store media at 4 °C.\nCytosine Beta-D- Arabino Furanoside\nDissolve 48 mg of cytosine beta-D-arabino furanoside in 10 mL of growth media to a stock concentration of 20 mM. Store solution at -20 °C.\nPoly-D-Lysine\nTo generate a 2 mg/mL poly D-lysine stock, add 10 mL of sterile H2O to 20 mg of poly D-lysine. Stock poly D-lysine should be stored at -80 °C in 100 µL aliquots.\nNOTE: The following solutions should be prepared prior to dissection and maintained at 4 °C until use.\nMgSO4 Supplemented Dissection Solution\nAdd 300 µL of stock MgSO4 to 250 mL of dissection solution.\nTrypsin Dissection Solution\nAdd 100 µL of stock trypsin and 12 µL of stock MgSO4 to 10 mL of dissection solution.\nTrypsin Inhibitor Solution 1\nAdd 164 µL of stock trypsin inhibitor, 250 µL of stock DNase 1 and 12 µL of stock MgSO4 to 10 mL of dissection solution.\nTrypsin Inhibitor Solution 2\nAdd 1040 µL of stock trypsin inhibitor, 750 µL of stock DNase 1 and 12 µL of stock MgSO4 to 10 mL of dissection solution.\nCaCl 2 supplemented dissection solution\nAdd 10 µL of stock CaCl2 and 25 µL of stock MgSO4 to 10 mL of dissection solution.\nPoly D-Lysine Coated Culture Dishes",
    "To coat culture dishes, dilute 100 µL of stock poly D-lysine in 40 mL of sterile H2O. For 35 mm Nunc culture dishes, add 2 mL of diluted poly D-Lysine solution. For 4 well plates, add 300 µL of diluted poly D-Lysine to each well.\nLet the poly D-lysine sit for 1 h before aspirating and washing each well with 4 mL or 600 µL (for 35 mm culture dishes or 4 well plates, respectively) of sterile H2O. Then aspirate the H2O and let the dishes air dry for 1 h.\n2. Brain Extraction and Isolation of Cerebellum\nDecapitate a 6-7 day old mouse pup using decapitation scissors. Perform the dissection of the brain in a sterile tissue culture hood.\nTo remove the brain, grasp the head using a pair of forceps and cut through the skin toward the anterior of the head using microdissection scissors as demonstrated in Figure 1. Then cut through the skull bone using a new pair of scissors to minimize risk of contamination. Remove the skull covering the brain using forceps and tease out the brain using forceps or a spatula.\nAs needed, cut through the optic nerve to facilitate getting the brain out as a whole.\nPlace the brain in the dissection solution which is supplemented with MgSO4. Keep the solution and the brain on ice.\nFollowing brain removal, under a dissection microscope, dissect out the cerebellum from the brain while still in MgSO4 supplemented dissection solution, and remove the meninges using fine forceps. Turn the cerebellum to its ventral side and insure removal of the choroid plexus.\nPool the cerebella into a 35-mm dish containing ~1 mL of MgSO4 supplemented dissection solution.\nChop the tissue into small pieces and transfer into a 50 mL tube containing 30 mL of MgSO4 buffered dissection solution.",
    "3. Mouse Cerebellar Granule Neuron Isolation and Culturing\nCentrifuge the 50 mL tube containing the chopped cerebral tissue for 5 min at 644 x g and 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and add 10 mL of trypsin dissection solution. Then shake the tube at high speed for 15 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 10 mL of trypsin inhibitor solution 1 to the tube and rock gently for 2 min.\nCentrifuge the tube for 5 min at 644 x g and 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and add 2 mL of trypsin inhibitor solution 2, and then transfer to a 15 mL tube.\nTriturate the tissue in the 15 mL tube until the solution becomes murky. Then let settle for 5 min.\nRemove the clear supernatant and transfer the supernatant to a new tube containing 1 mL of CaCl2 supplemented dissection solution.\nAdd another mL of trypsin inhibitor solution 2 to the bottom of the tube containing the pellet from step 3.6. Triturate again and let settle for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and add it to the tube containing the supernatant from step 3.7 (That is a repeat of steps 3.6-3.7). Repeat this process until most of the tissue is mechanically dissociated.\nAdd 0.3 mL of CaCl2 supplemented dissection solution to the supernatant collection for every mL of supernatant.\nMix the contents of the tube and then centrifuge for 5 min at 644 x g.\nRemove the supernatant and add 10 mL of fresh media to the pellet and mix.",
    "Cells may then be counted and diluted to a concentration of 1.5 x 106 cells/mL. Please note that in general 10 million cells are expected from each dissected brain, dependent on trypsinization time and efficiency of dissection.Plate cells on previously made poly D-lysine plates. For 4-well plates, plate 0.5 mL, giving 7.5 x 105 cells per well. For 35-mm dishes, plate 4 mL, giving 6 x 106 cells per plate.\nAfter 24 h, add cytosine-β-arabino furanoside (AraC) to the plates to reduce glial contamination. For each mL of media 0.5 µL of 20 mM AraC is required. Addition of AraC does not require a media change. If cells are to be maintained for 7-8 days, repeat this treatment on day 3.\nMaintain cultures in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C and feed with 100 µL of 100 mM glucose added to the culture for every 2 mL of media every 2 days past 5 days. A complete media change is not required.\n4. Lentivirus Packaging, Purification and Titration\nNOTE: The protocol for the packaging, concentration, purification and titration of lentivirus has previously been described in detail without the use of a kit 28, including alternative methods for titration, such as flow cytometry 29. Here we briefly present the protocol used in our lab for the production of lentivirus to study neuronal injury using speedy virus purification solution and a qPCR lentiviral titration kit.\nPlate Hek293T cells in 10 cm culture dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. For obtaining a high viral titer, grow at least 5 plates of Hek293T cells for each transfection. Make sure on the day of transfection cells are 70% confluent. Change media three hours prior to transfection.",
    "For each transfection, prepare two tubes. In tube 1 add 1.5 mL MEM-reduced serum media and 41 µL of transfection reagent, mix well. In tube 2, add 1.5 mL of MEM-reduced serum media and 6 µg of transfer plasmid, 6 µg of pCMV-dR8.2 vector (packaging plasmid), 3 µg pCMV-VSV-G vector (envelope plasmid), and 35 µL of p3000 enhancer reagent (supplied with lipofectamine). Mix well, and combine tubes 1 and 2, vortex and incubate for 15 min.\nRemove 50% of the media from Hek293T plates and add DNA-lipid complexes to cells. Incubate for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Remove media and replace with 5 mL of fresh DMEM, incubate overnight.\nAt 24 h post-transfection, collect the first batch of viral supernatant from each plate. Keep the viral media at 4 °C and add 5 mL of fresh media into each plate of Hek293T cells. Incubate overnight.\n48 h post-transfection, collect the second batch of viral supernatant, combine it with the first batch and centrifuge combined viral supernatant for 10 min at 600 x g.\nFilter the supernatant through a filter with 45 µm pore size.\nPurify the virus using a speedy virus purification solution. For every 45 mL of viral supernatant, add 5 mL of lentiviral binding solution, mix, and centrifuge for 10 min at >5,000 x g and 4 °C.\nRemove supernatant carefully so as not to disturb the pellet.\nAdd 20-40 µL of medium and re-suspend the pellet. Aliquot and store at -80 °C.\nTo obtain the lentiviral titer, a qPCR lentiviral titration kit is used. Dilute 2 µL of purified virus in 500 µL of PBS. Add 2 µL of the diluted virus to 18 µL of virus lysis buffer (provided in the kit).",
    "Set up three different RT-q-PCR reactions in triplicates and label them as, viral lysate, positive control 1 (STD1), and positive control 2 (STD2). For each reaction add, 12.5 µL of 2x qPCR MasterMix, 2.5 µL of either viral lysate or STD1 (provided in the kit) or STD2 (provided in the kit), and 10 µL of reagent-mix (provided in the kit) in 0.2 mL PCR tubes.\nSet the PCR program as follows: 20 min at 42 °C for reverse transcription, 10 min at 95 °C for enzyme activation, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C for denaturation and 1 min at 60 °C for annealing/extension.\nCalculate the viral titer using this formula:\n\tTiter of viral lysate = 5 x 107/23(Ctx-Ct1)/(Ct2-Ct1).\n\tCtx = average Ct value of unknown sample, Ct1 = average value of STD1, Ct2 = average value of STD2.",
    "NOTE: CGNs can be best transduced with lentiviruses or infected with adenoviruses depending on the mode of injury being studied. Addition of lentiviruses at an MOI of 2-3 to cell culture solution at the time of plating is used to study NMDA induced signalling at day 7 of the culture. This results in more than 80% transduction and is appropriate to pursue with biochemical analyses of these neurons (Figure 2). Addition of adenoviruses at day 5 of culture (at MOI 50) and studying NMDA induced signalling at day 7-8 is used for other techniques such as imaging. This treatment results in less than 10% infection of neurons, making it ideal for imaging and co-localization of proteins. Adenoviruses can be used at the time of plating to study DNA damage induced cell death by addition of camptothecin at day 2-3 or oxidative stress by addition of hydrogen peroxide. The presence of fluorescence proteins (GFP, RFP, CFP or YFP) tagged to the gene of interest can be used to estimate percent transduction and potential toxicity. With the recommended MOI, we see minimal toxicity and maximum transduction (Figure 3).\n5. Modeling Neuronal Injury\nTo induce NMDA induced neuronal excitotoxicity, following 7 days in vitro, treat CGNs with 100 µM NMDA and 10 µM glycine for 1 h. Replace all the medium with conditioned medium from parallel cultures with no treatment. This concentration results in 50% cell death at 24 h post treatment (Figure 3C). Mitochondrial fragmentation is evident at 6-8 h post treatment (See Jahani-Asl et al.26,27).",
    "To induce ROS-induced cell death (oxidative stress), treat neurons with 75-100 µM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and switch to conditioned media from parallel cultures following 5 min exposure to H2O2. Note, due to the instability of H2O2, optimize the concentration to a level that induces 50-70% cell death in culture following 24 h of treatment.\nTo induce DNA damage induced cell death, treat CGNs with 10 µM camptothecin. This concentration induces more than 50% cell death in 24 h. Mitochondrial fragmentation and early apoptotic signalling occurs 2-3 h after addition of camptothecin at this concentration (See Jahani-Asl et al.18)\nTo induce low K+ induced neuronal apoptosis in CGNs, change media containing 25 mM K+ to low potassium media with 5 mM K+ following 7 days in vitro.\nSubscription Required.
