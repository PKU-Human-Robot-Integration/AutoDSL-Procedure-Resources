    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart I: Detection of YAP phosphorylation\nNote: This protocol is modified from Chen et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nSeeding HEK293A cells\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this section, all cell culture steps are to be performed under “aseptic conditions” in a cell culture hood.\nOnce HEK293A cells reach 80%–90% confluency, they are ready for passage.\nAspirate old culture media from the 100 cm culture dish and gently rinse the cells with ∼3.0 mL of sterile 1× PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of pre-warmed 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA directly to the cells and incubate at 37°C for 1–2 min until cells become shrunk and round and have detached from the bottom of the dish. During the digestion period, you can tap the edge of the culture dish with your hand.\nAdd 3 mL of pre-warmed DMEM with FBS to neutralize Trypsin-EDTA and mix the cells by pipetting up and down repeatedly until achieving a single-cell suspension, and then transfer the approximately 5 mL cell suspension to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300×g for 3 min, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with an appropriate amount of pre-warmed DMEM with FBS and mix well by pipetting up and down several times.\nCount cells using the automated cell counter (Countstar) and plate the cells into 6-well plates at a density of 5×105 to 8 ×105 cells/well, depending on the experimental needs. Add pre-warmed DMEM with FBS to make a final volume of 2 mL/well. Culture the cells in a standard incubator for 24 h.\nNote: The amount of cells can be scaled down to 12 or 24 well plates to meet experimental needs.",
    "Critical: Cell density will affect the phosphorylation of Hippo pathway components, including YAP, TAZ, LATS and MST (Meng et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Seed appropriate cell numbers into each well to ensure that the cells reach the desired confluence the next day.\nCritical: It is recommended to overexpress MST1 by transient transfection because the phosphorylation signal of endogenous MST1 in HEK293A cells is a little weak and difficult to be detected.\nCollect cell lysis for immunoblot analysis\nTiming: 0.5 h for collect cell lysate, 2 days for immunoblot analysis\nIn this section, the cell lysate will be subjected to immunoblot analysis to detect the phosphorylation for Hippo pathway components. This experiment is described separately according to the two different types of gels, i.e., Phos-tag gel for YAP phosphorylation analyses and regular gel for pYAP(S127), pLATS1 (T1079) and pMST1(T183) analyses.\nCollect cell lysate: Aspirate old culture media as completely as possible. Then harvest cells by directly adding 300–1000 μL 1× SDS-PAGE Sample Buffer per well in 6-well plates, and shake the plate thoroughly using a plate shaker at 150×g for at least 10 min. Transfer the sample to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and heat at 95°C–101°C for 5 min. Centrifuge at 16,000×g for 5 min at 15°C–25°C and store at −20°C for subsequent immunoblot analysis.\nNote: You can treat the cells with designed stimulation before collecting the cells, such as heat shock, serum starvation, small molecule compounds, osmotic stress, etc.\nNote: There is no need to add Protease/Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail to the sample buffer since all protein is denatured quickly. Cell lysates prepared in the 1× SDS-PAGE Sample Buffer can be stored at −20°C for three months.",
    "Note: No need to determine the protein concentrations using a commercial Bradford assay or BCA Protein Assay Kit as long as each culture well has similar amount of cells. Their concentrations in different samples can be normalized by adjusting the volume of the Sample Buffer. In general, about 100 μL of Sample Buffer is used for every 2 × 105 cells in the well. For example, when the HEK293A cells reach 100% confluence in a 6-well plate, the number of cells is approximately 1.5 × 106 and 800 μL of Sample Buffer should be added. If the cell confluence only reaches 50% in the treatment well, add only 400 μL of Sample Buffer accordingly.\nLoading sample: Take out the comb carefully and aspirate any remaining liquid in the wells before loading the samples. Load 10–15 μL of sample per well.\nNote: Protein ladder should be loaded on the leftmost and rightmost side of the sample well, and judge your sample loading order by the color shade of protein ladder. Dilute the pre-stained protein ladder from Thermo Fisher Scientific using 1× SDS-PAGE Sample Buffer (250 μl protein ladder diluted in 1 ml Sample Buffer), and load the same volume of blank sample buffer to any empty wells to ensure uniform electrophoresis.\nElectrophoresis: Start electrophoresis at 80 V for 30 min, until all the samples enter the separating gel.\nFor Phos-tag gel, then run at 100 V for about 2.5 h until the 55 kDa marker in the pre-stained protein ladder is around 1.5 cm from the bottom of the gel (YAP protein is above the 70 kDa marker).\nFor Regular gel, then run at 120 V for about 1.5 h until the bromophenol blue indicator line is around 0.5 cm from the bottom of the gel.",
    "Transferring: The PVDF membrane with a 0.45 μm pore size is activated by soaking in methanol for 2 min. Assemble the wet transferring system, and transfer for 2 h (Phos-tag gel) or 1 h (Regular gel) at 4°C in the cold room or refrigerator. Set constant current at 370 mA for one Trans-Blot tank, or 740 mA for two Trans-Blot tanks.\nNote: The filter paper used for blotting transfer should be chromatography paper. The thickness of the filter paper on one side of Gel Holder Cassettes should be 0.7–0.8mm. Therefore, use 2 sheets of filter paper with a thickness of 0.4 mm on one side. If use commercially available filter paper with a thickness of 0.8 mm, one sheet on each side is sufficient.\nCritical: It takes more time to transfer YAP protein from phos-tag gel to PVDF membrane than that of regular gel. Therefore, in order to avoid overheating of the transfer buffer, it is strongly recommended to change the Ice Cooling Unit after 1 h’s phos-tag gel transferring.\nWash the whole PVDF membrane one time with 1× TBST for 5 min.\nBlock with 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at 15°C–25°C with gentle rocking.\nDilute the primary antibody in 5% BSA in TBST. Incubate and rock the membrane with primary antibody around 10–15 h at 4°C.",
    "Note: The primary antibody should be diluted in 5% BSA at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. Details as follows: YAP, 1:1,000; LATS1, 1:2000; MST1, 1:2000; pYAP (S127), 1:1000; pLTAS1 (T1079), 1:1000; pMST1 (T183), 1:500; GAPDH, 1:4000. The primary antibody solution can be used multiple times depending on the quality of the antibody. For a short term (within a week), the antibody solution can be stored at 4°C to avoid freeze-thaw cycles. For a long time (more than a week), we suggest to store the antibody solution at −20°C.\nCritical: The antibody against YAP protein is used as primary antibody in the Phos-tag gel analysis. Please do not use the phosphoantibodies of pYAP(S127).\nThe next morning, pipette out the primary antibody and save for future use (the antibody can be reused for 5 times usually). Wash the blot 3 times with 1× TBST with rocking for 10 min each.\nIncubate with HRP-linked secondary antibody (diluted in 5% milk in TBST at 1:5000) for 1 h at 15°C–25°C.\nNote: Be sure to use a secondary antibody that can recognize the source of the specific primary antibody (most are from rabbit or mouse).\nWash the blot 4 times with 1× TBST for 15 min each with rocking.\nIncubate the membrane with the Western HRP substrate for 1 min at 15°C–25°C. Remove the membrane from the working reagent and absorb any excess liquid or bubbles with Kimwipe or filter paper, place the membrane between two transparent plastic sheets or wrap the membrane with Saran wrap, expose to autoradiography film in an X-ray film cassette, develop the film with a film developer in a dark room.",
    "Note: The exposure time varies for different target proteins and antibodies. A good starting point is an exposure time of 1 min. Avoid over exposure time, which will saturate the signal band and conceal the changing trend of the target proteins.\nPart II: detection of LATS kinase activity\nSeeding HEK293A cells for immunoprecipitation (IP)\nTiming: 1 h\nOnce HEK293A cells reach 80%–90% confluency, they are ready for passage.\nNote: This protocol certainly does not only apply to 6 well plates. To ensure that sufficient amount of LATS1 is recovered for subsequent IP experiments, it can be scaled up in 100 mm culture dishes to meet experimental needs.\nCritical: Cell density will affect the Hippo pathway, including the localization of YAP and activity of LATS1 kinase (Zhao et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Seed appropriate cell numbers into 6 well plates or dishes to make sure that the cells reach the desired confluence next day.\nAlternatives: 24 h after seeding the cells, expression plasmids or siRNAs transfection may be performed if the expression of a gene needs to be modulated. The transfected HEK293A cells can be reseeded.\nCell lysis, LATS immunoprecipitation and kinase assay\nTiming: around 5 h\nPrewash the Magnetic Beads: Thoroughly vortex (max speed, 30 s) the commercial magnetic beads tube, then pipette an appropriate amount of beads (10 μL/Sample) into a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, wash the beads 3 times with mild lysis buffer (MLB) and final resuspend with MLB with protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (20 μL/Sample).\nNote: Consider the amount of loss during operation, prepare the magnetic beads for (n + 2) samples.",
    "Note: Detailed wash method: add 1 mL of wash buffer to the tube containing an appropriate amount of beads, vortex thoroughly and place the tube into a magnetic stand for 2 min to collect the beads against the side of the tube; remove the supernatant; take out the tube from the magnetic stand, repeated the above washing for total 3 times.\nFor HEK293A cells in the 6 well plates or dishes, gently aspirate old media, wash twice with cold PBS gently.\nNote: You can treat the cells with various signals before collecting the cells, such as heat shock, serum starvation, small molecule compounds, osmotic stress.\nCritical: HEK293A cells detach from the surface of plate very easily. Thus, all rinsing steps should be performed carefully and gently, as to not cause HEK293A detachment. LATS activity can be rapidly perturbed by many environmental factors, thus ice-cold PBS should be used to wash the cells and harvest should be completed promptly on ice.\nAdd 1 mL MLB with protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails directly onto the cells for each sample, shake the plates or dishes at 4°C for 10 min, and then transfer the cell-containing solution to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nSpin at 16,000×g, 4°C for 10 min, to separate all the cell debris from the supernatant, and transfer the lysis supernatant to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, which need to be maintained on ice.\nAdd LATS1 antibody (CST, 1: 1000) and pre-washed magnetic beads resuspended in MLB (20 uL/sample) (from step 14) together into the lysis samples prepared in step 17, invert gently to mix at 4°C for 2 h. Include a negative control with the normal rabbit IgG (the LATS1 antibody is rabbit IgG). Photos of sample tubes with an inverted mixing at 4°C can be seen in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1359-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Photos of immunoprecipitation processes\n(A) Sample tubes were inverted gently by a rotator to mix the lysis, antibody, and magnetic beads at 4°C.\n(B) Magnetic beads were collected against the side of the tube by a magnetic stand.\nCritical: In conventional IP experiments, after adding specific antibodies, the samples usually be incubated around 10–15 h at 4°C with mixing. But in the kinase assay experiment, to ensure the activity of LATS1 kinase, the incubation time should not exceed 2 h.\nNote: The concentration of Normal Rabbit IgG is 1μg/μL, which is higher than the concentration of LATS1 antibodies from the CST company (around 0.2 μg/μL). Thus, the IgG control needs to be diluted with MLB to the same concentration before use.\nAfter 2 h’s incubation, collect the beads with a magnetic stand, remove the supernatant, then wash 5 times with MLB and subsequently 1 time with 1× Protein Kinases Buffer. A photo of sample tubes on a magnetic stand to collect the beads against the side of the tube is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nCritical: The remaining reagent components in the tube may affect the kinase reaction, so it must be thoroughly washed with MLB at least 5 times, and the 1× Protein Kinases Buffer should be used for the last washing.\nNote: Detailed wash method: add 1 mL of wash buffer into each tube, invert the tube several times and gently shake at 4°C for 5 min, then place the tube back into a magnetic stand for 2 min to collect the beads against the side of the tube; remove the supernatant; repeat above washing steps.",
    "Add 40 μL of kinase reaction buffer with substrate GST-YAP per sample directly to the above-washed beads in step 19, mix gently by finger tap, and incubate on a heat shaker with 300 rpm at 30°C for 30 min.\nCritical: To ensure the reaction quality, it’s better to make the reaction buffer mix just before use and samples can be manually mixed by a finger tap every 10 minutes during the incubation.\nAfter 30 min at 30°C, add 13.3 μL of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the tube, vortex to mix completely and then heat the samples at 100°C for 5 min.\nSpin down the magnetic beads/samples at 16,000×g, 15°C–25°C for 10 min, then magnetically separate the beads and transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube and saved at −20°C for immunoblot analysis.\nPause point: Lysates prepared for immunoblot analysis can be stored at −20°C for several weeks.\nDetection of YAP phosphorylation using immunoblot analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nPlease refer to the corresponding step 2–12 in Part I.\nPart III: detection of YAP or TEAD subcellular localization\nNote: This protocol is modified from Lin et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nSeeding HEK293A cells for immunofluorescence (IF)\nTiming: 1.5 h\nOnce HEK293A cells reach 80%–90% confluent growth, prepare and collect cells for seeding. For most information, please refer to the corresponding steps in \"Part I\". For the last step, plate cells into 12-well plates on sterile round coverslips at a density of 2 × 105 cells/1 mL/well. Culture the cells in a standard incubator around 10–15 h.",
    "Note: For Immunofluorescence assay, usually a 24-well plate or a 12-well plate is sufficient to meet experimental needs, and it is not necessary to use a 6-well plate. When seeding the cells into the well, make sure no air bubbles are trapped underneath the coverslips and get an even distribution of cells.\nNote: The coverslips need to be sterilized by immersing in ethanol or autoclaved. If using ethanol for sterilization, the coverslips need to dry completely by evaporation before use.\nCritical: Cell density will affect the subcellular localization of YAP/TAZ or TEAD (Meng et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Seed appropriate cell numbers into 12 or 24 well plates to make sure that the cells reach the desired confluence the next day.\nAlternatives: To enhance cell adherence, coverslips may be pre-coated with poly-L-ornithine as follows:\nUse sterile forceps to carefully place one sterile coverslip into one well of the 12-well plates.\nPretreat the coverslip with poly-L-ornithine solution diluted 1:20 at 37°C for 20 min. For one well, dilute 25 μL poly-L-ornithine (0.1 mg/mL) into 500 μL sterile 1× PBS (Final working concentration 0.005 mg/mL).\nAspirate the coating solution and wash with PBS for several times. Keep the plates in a tissue culture hood for a period of time to allow the coverslip to dry completely.\nThen seed cells on poly-L -ornithine-coated coverslips.\nCritical: HEK293A cells are very easy to fall off the coverslip during the permeabilization and wash steps of immunofluorescence. It is strongly recommended to coat the coverslips.\nImmunofluorescence staining\nTiming: 2 days\nAspirate the old medium in wells, rinse them couple times with PBS.\nNote: You can treat the cells with various signals before staining, such as heat shock, serum starvation, small molecule compounds, osmotic stress.\nFix cells with 500 μL 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 15°C–25°C.",
    "Note: The goal of fixation is to maintain the cellular structure as close as possible to the native state. There are several fixation methods suitable for IF, like paraformaldehyde or methanol. You can choose the best one for your target proteins.\nWash with PBS 3 times.\nPermeabilization with 500 μL 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 15°C–25°C.\nNote: The permeabilization step help antibodies entering the fixed cells. Besides Triton X-100, various other detergents can be used according to your experimental needs, including NP-40, Tween-20 and Saponin.\nWash with PBS 3 times.\nBlocking with 2% BSA+2% Goat Serum in PBS for 30 min at 15°C–25°C.\nPrepare all the primary antibodies in 2% BSA in PBS, incubated with the samples around 10–15 h at 4°C. For YAP/TAZ (Clone 63.7, mouse source) 1:200 dilution; PAN-TEAD (Clone D3F7L, rabbit source) 1:500 dilution.\nNote: For double/triple staining, the primary antibodies can be mixed before being applied to the coverslips, as long as they can be recognized by different secondary antibodies (such as mouse vs rabbit).\nRemove the primary antibody, and wash with PBS 3 times.\nIncubate samples with the Goat anti-Mouse IgG or Goat anti-Rabbit IgG second antibody prepared in 2% BSA in PBS (1:1000 dilution) at 15°C–25°C in the dark for 1 h.\nNote: Use high-quality and cross-adsorbed the Alexa Fluor secondary antibody conjugates.\nWash with PBS 3 times.\nMount the coverslips at the center of the slide with ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI, and wait for several hours to let the mounting medium solidifies. Draw off excess mountant before they are examined by microscope.",
    "Alternatives: The concentration of DAPI that comes with the commercial mountant is very low, resulting in weak DNA staining. One can stain the samples with 1–10 μg/mL DAPI working solution at 15°C–25°C in the dark for 5 minutes before mounting. The DAPI stock solution is usually 1 mg/mL prepared in pure water.\nCritical: Because the fluorescence intensity of the sample is easily bleached during confocal photography, a high-quality antifading mountant should be used. Make sure the coverslip with the cell-side is down. Never try to move the coverslip once it falls on the slide or try to squeeze the few air bubbles trapped between the coverslip and the slide, which will damage the structure of the cells.\nImages were captured with Olympus FV1000 confocal microscopy or microscope available to you. Immunofluorescence data were collected by NIS-Elements Advanced Research 5.11.00 imaging software and the signals from the channels were merged using ImageJ (1.52a) software."
