    "1. Plate coating\nCoat a 96-well microplate with poly-L-lysine (1 mg/mL, diluted in 0.1 M borate buffer [pH: 8.5]; 100 µL/well) and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Only coat the wells that need to be used. In the experiments performed here, the middle 60 wells are used. The borate buffer is prepared by mixing 50 mM boric acid and 12 mM borate in sterilized water.\nWash the plate twice with sterilized water (250 µL/well).\nWash the plate once with fresh culture medium without supplements (250 µL/well).\nDry the plate on a clean bench for 20 min.\nWrap the plate with aluminum foil and keep it at 4 °C until use (valid for 1 month).\n2. Cell seeding\nAdd 50 µL/well of the culture medium to the coated plate and keep it in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min to 1 h. Fill the peripheral wells with sterilized water (200 µL/well).\n\tNOTE: The culture medium is prepared by adding 50x B-27, 400x Glutamax, and 100 U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin to the neurobasal medium (refer to the Table of Materials for details).\nRemove the neuron cryovial from the liquid nitrogen tank. The neurons used here were DMSO-cryopreserved neurons11.\nImmerse the cryovial in a 37 °C heat block for up to 3 min and partially thaw the contents. Do not warm up the cryovial for too long. Transfer the contents to a 50 mL tube as soon as it is thawed.\nSlowly transfer the neuron cryovial contents to a sterile 50 mL tube drop-wise (50 µL/s) using a 1 mL pipette with a wide-pore tip.",
    "Rinse the empty cryovial with 1 mL of the culture medium (room temperature; RT). Transfer this 1 mL of the culture medium from the cryovial drop-wise (50 µL/s) to the 50 mL tube containing the cell suspension.\nAdd 9 mL of the culture medium (RT) to the 50 mL tube drop-wise (0.5 mL/s) and make up the volume to 11 mL. Do not repeat pipetting, but mix the cell suspension slowly.\nCount the cell number (use a cell counter or a hemocytometer).\nTransfer all the cell suspension to a reservoir and dispense the cell suspension to the 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette with wide-pore tips (1.0 x 104 cells/well). To reduce the culture medium evaporation, fill the peripheral wells with sterilized water (step 2.1).\n\tNOTE: This study confirms that the culture medium evaporation is small for a 3-week culture without medium exchange. The reduction rate of the medium is 3.6% (n = 120 wells). Thus, the osmolality change will not be drastic during the 3-week incubation period.\nIncubate the neurons for 1-2 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nReplace the culture medium with 100 µL of preheated culture medium (37 °C) per well and put it back in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator (no medium change is required during culture).\n3. Ara-C treatment\nAt 4 days in vitro (DIV), add cytosine β-D-arabino-furanoside (Ara-C) to a final concentration of 0.2 µM per well to reduce the growth of glial cells.\n4. Drug treatments\nAt 21 days in vitro, treat the cells with the drugs of interest.\nKeep the temperature of the plate at 37 °C during drug treatments.\nFor a positive control, treat the cells with 100 µM glutamate (per well for final concentration) for 10 min before fixation.\n5. Fixation",
    "For the fixation, use 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (100 µL/well).\nAfter ~20 min of fixation, wash the wells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 250 µL/well) 2x for 5 min each.\n6. Immunocytochemistry\nWash the cells with PBS (250 µL/well) 1x for 5 min.\nPermeabilize the cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 (100 µL/well) in PBS for 5 min.\nWash the cells with PBS (250 µL/well) 3x for 5 min each.\nFor blocking, use 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBSA; 100 µL/well) for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the cells with anti-drebrin (1:1) and anti-Microtubule Associated Protein 2 (MAP2) (1:000) antibodies (60 µL/well) at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the cells with PBS (250 µL/well) 4x for 5 min each.\nIncubate the cells with appropriate secondary antibodies and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI; 1:1000) in PBSA (60 µL/well) for 2 h at RT.\nWash the cells with PBS (250 µL/well) 4x for 5 min each.\nStore the cells in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide (150 µL/well).\n7. Image acquisition and analysis\nTo acquire the images, use an appropriate microscope.\nTo identify the cell bodies of neurons, use both MAP2-positive and DAPI-positive regions.\nTo identify the dendrites of neurons, use MAP2-positive signals without cell bodies.\nTo identify drebrin clusters, use drebrin-positive signals along MAP2 positive dendrites."
