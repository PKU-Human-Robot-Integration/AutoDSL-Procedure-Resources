    "This protocol has been approved in the context of a previous randomized controlled trial8 by the human research ethics committee region Arnhem-Nijmegen, the Netherlands (nr. 2004/239).\n1. Preparation for Testing\nInformed consent:\nReview the informed consent form together with the patient.\nAnswer any questions that patient may have regarding the study.\nObtain written informed consent by having the patient sign the informed consent form and signing it yourself.\nTesting environment:\nPerform all the measurements in the protocol in a stimulus poor and temperature stable environment (~21 °C, no music, no uncovered windows, phones switched off).\n\t\tNOTE: The clothing of the experimenter needs to be as neutral as possible, i.e. wear a lab coat, be 'naked below the elbows,' wear no jewelry, and wear no perfume. It is well known that experimenter related factors may have influence on the outcome of the measurements. Some of these factors are not completely standardizable (e.g. sex), but one should keep this in mind when preparing the performance of the measurements.\nDuring measurements, ensure that the patient and the researcher are the only people in the room, ask others to leave.\nAttach a 'do not disturb' sign to the door to avoid being disturbed during the measurements.\nPerform all testing with the patient in the supine position on the bed, except for the CPM test, which is performed with the patient in sitting position.\nSites of testing:\nMark the following sites for threshold testing using a surgical skin marker:",
    "area under the greater tubercle on bilateral shoulders (C5 dermatome, pressure and electric thresholds), the bilateral thenar (C6, dermatome, pressure), on bilateral iliac crests (L1 dermatome, pressure and electric), bilateral in the mid axillary line at nipple height or 7 cm from the surgical incision in case of breast cancer surgery (T4 dermatome, pressure and electric thresholds).\nMark the CPM testing site using a surgical skin marker: 15 cm above the patella on the non-dominant body site (L3 dermatome, pressure).\nMark a test run site using a surgical skin marker, for example, 15 cm above the patella on the dominant body site.\nElectrical stimulation configuration:\nApply two self-adhesive skin electrodes on each side of the marked spot on each electrical stimulation test site. Place the electrodes with their outer diameter such that they are just touching each other at the marked spot.\nSet the QST stimulator to deliver tetanic stimulation (100 Hz, 0.2 ms square waves) – Figure 1. Set the ramping rate to 1 mA/s. Set the initial current to 0 mA, the maximum current is automatically set to 50 mA for safety purposes.\n2. Electrical Pain Thresholds\nDelivery of electricity:\nUse the QST stimulator. Connect the self-adhesive electrodes to the stimulator using the connection leads.\nMeasurement of visual analogue scale (VAS):\nUse the VAS slider connected to the QST stimulator to obtain VAS scores. The VAS slider consists of a box with a mobile lever on a horizontal bar that represents the VAS. Hand the slider to the patient.\nExplain to the patient how to use the slider: \"The control unit has a slider. This slider can be moved to indicate how you experience the stimulus on a scale of no pain to the worst imaginable pain.\"\nTest run:",
    "Explain the procedure for the electrical detection threshold (EDT) to the patient: \"We will conduct a test run to get you familiarized with the measurement. The stimulation will start when you press the button, will gradually increase, and will stop immediately upon letting go of the button. Please press the button when I tell you to do so and let go when you feel anything.\"\n\t\tNOTE: All instructions are read from a manual to aid in standardization.\nPerform a single test run on the test run site to demonstrate the procedure. Record the result on the measurement sheet — Figure 2. Make sure the patient cannot read the values of the measurements during the execution of the tests.\nAsk the patient to indicate how he/she experienced the stimulus using the VAS slider and note the result.\nExplain the procedure for the electrical pain threshold (EPT) to the patient: \"We will conduct a test run to get you familiarized with the measurement. This test is aimed at determining your pain perception in response to electrical stimulation. The stimulation will start when you press the button, will gradually increase, and will stop immediately upon letting go of the button. Please press the button when I tell you to do so and let go when the stimulation becomes painful.\"\nPerform a single test run on the testing site to demonstrate the procedure. Record the result on the measurement sheet.\nAsk the patient to indicate how he/she experienced the stimulus using the VAS slider and note the result.\nMeasurement:\nExplain the procedure for EDT again to the patient, using wording from 2.3.1.",
    "Measure the EDT at the different study sites (first C5, then T4, then L1). Perform EDT measurement three times at each measurement site, allow at least 15 seconds in between measurements to avoid windup effects.\nAsk the patient to rate the associated pain on VAS after the last EDT measurement at each site. Note electrical values and VAS scores on the measurement sheet. Make sure the patient cannot read the values of the measurements during the execution of the tests.\nExplain the procedure to determine the EPT again using wording from 2.3.4.\nMeasure the EPT at the different study sites (first C5, then T4, then L1). Perform EPT measurement three times at each measurement site, allow at least 15 seconds in between measurements to avoid windup effects.\nAsk the patient to rate the associated pain on VAS after the last EPT measurement at each site.\nNote test electrical values and VAS scores on the measurement sheet. Make sure the patient cannot read the values of the measurements during the execution of the tests.\n3. Pressure Pain Thresholds\nDelivery of pressure:\nDeliver pressure with the pressure algometer with a 1.0 cm2 probe under a 90° angle. Use a ramping rate of ~5 N/s by manually adjusting the applied pressure and the pressure on the display. Start at 0 N and apply up to a maximum of 200 N for safety purposes.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to let the device skid on the skin. To prevent skidding of the algometer it is important to place the probe perpendicular to the skin and to support the algometer with both hands while slowly increasing the pressure. The researcher should stand firmly to provide a controlled increase in pressure.\nTest run:",
    "Explain the procedure to the patient: \"We will conduct a test run to get you familiarized with the measurement. This measurement is aimed at determining your perception of pressure pain in muscle. I will put a pressure measurement device on your muscle and will gradually increase the pressure. Please notify me when the pressure feeling becomes throbbing, burning, or painful by saying 'now.'\"\nPerform a single test run on the test site. Make sure the patient cannot read the values of the measurements during the execution of the tests. Record the result on the measurement sheet.\nMeasurement:\nRepeat the instructions for patient using wording from 3.2.1.\nApply pressure to the different study sites (first C5, then C6, then T4, then L1). Perform pressure pain threshold (PPT) measurement two times at each measurement site, allow at least 15 seconds in between measurements to avoid windup effects.\nAsk the patient to rate the associated pain on VAS after the last PPT measurement at each site.\nNote test pressure values and VAS scores on the measurement sheet.\n4. Conditioned Pain Modulation Paradigm\nPreconditioning test stimulus\nRepeat 3.1.1. but use PPT as test stimulus. Repeat the instructions for patient using wording from 3.2.1.\nMeasure pre-conditioning PPT at the CPM testing site (m. rectus femoris (L3) on the non-dominant side, 15 cm above the patella). Ask the patient to rate the associated pain on the VAS slider. Note the value at which the pressure become painful and the associated pain score.",
    "Explain the ice water procedure to the patient: \"This is a test to gain information on the way your body processes different pain signals at the same time. I will ask you to submerse your hand into the ice water in the bucket. Place your hand in the water until the wrist and with the fingers spread. Please hold your hand in the ice water until you can no longer tolerate it.\"\nTell the patient to remove their hand from the water after 3 minutes of immersion or sooner if the pain becomes intolerable. \"Every 10 seconds, I will ask you to rate the pain on a 0 to 10 scale, in which 0 represents no pain and 10 unbearable pain. After you take your hand out of the ice water we will measure the pressure pain threshold on your leg again, similar to how we did that before.\"\nConditioning stimulus:\nUse the cold pressor task as conditioning stimulus. Measure the water temperature using a temperature probe and note the temperature (target temperature between 1 °C and 4 °C).\nAsk patient to immerse dominant hand in ice-chilled water. Ask the patient to rate the pain throughout the cold pressure task every 10 seconds on VAS and note the result. Note the completed immersion time on the measurement sheet (maximum duration is 180 seconds, on average 56 ± 55 s8).\nDetermine test stimulus post-conditioning:\nMeasure PPT on the CPM test site after the conditioning stimulus. Ask the patient to rate the associated pain on VAS and note PPT and VAS score on sheet.\n5. Calculations\nEPTs:\nCalculate the mean value for each testing location of the EDTs and EPTs.\nPPTs:\nCalculate the mean value for each testing location of the PPTs.\nCPM:",
    "Determine the CPM effect by calculating the relative change (in %) in the PPT at the CPM test location before and after the conditioning stimulus10.\n\t\t                CPM = ([PPTpost – PPTpre] / PPTpre) * 100\n\t\tCPM = conditioned pain modulation; PPT = pressure pain threshold.\nSubscription Required.
