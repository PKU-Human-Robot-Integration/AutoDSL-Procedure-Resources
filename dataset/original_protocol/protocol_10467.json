    "1. Silanization and Biomolecule Functionalization of Slide or Polycarbonate Membrane\nNote: Many of the chemicals and solutions within this protocol have high evaporation rates (ethanol (EtOH), acetone, etc.). Other steps entail long incubation times for low evaporation rates. Paraffin film is recommended to seal containers. Caution: Many of the chemicals (including: sulfuric acid, acetone, (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane, glutaraldehyde, EtOH) are considered hazardous, or volatile. Consult material safety data sheet (MSDS) of each material for proper storage, handling, and disposal before use.\nPlace new glass slide measuring 75 mm by 50 mm by 1 mm, in clean, glass slide staining dish without regard to orientation, ensuring full immersion. Use container for steps 1.1-1.12.\n\tNote: For co-culture, include polycarbonate (PC) membrane with 0.4 micron pore size, cut to size of 75 mm by 50 mm, for all subsequent steps for PC functionalization and EC seeding.\nImmerse slide in sulfuric acid (20%), O/N.\n\tCaution: Consult MSDS for sulfuric acid before use.\nWash slide by immersing in deionized water (DI) for 5 min, three times, changing DI each time.\nImmerse slide in acetone for 30 min.\n\tCaution: Consult MSDS for acetone before use.\nImmerse slide in 6% (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane / acetone solution O/N.\n\tCaution: Consult MSDS for (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and acetone before use.\nImmerse slide in acetone for 5 min, three times, changing acetone each time.\n\tCaution: Consult MSDS for acetone before use.\nWash slide by immersing in DI for 5 min, three times, changing DI each time.\nImmerse slide in 1.5% glutaraldehyde / DI solution for 60 min.\n\tCaution: Consult MSDS for glutaraldehyde before use.\nWash slide by immersing in DI for 5 min, two times, changing DI each time.\nPlace slides into 70% ethanol (EtOH) for 30 min in sterile, laminar flow hood.",
    "Remove EtOH and allow remaining residue to evaporate. Immerse slides in sterile DI and drain in order to rehydrate the slides.\n\tNote: Slides or PC membrane may be sealed in glass slide holder and stored at 4 °C up to one week. Upon use for cell culture, repeat steps 1.10 and 1.11.\nRemove the slide from the slide holder and place it into a 100 mm by 100 mm square petri dish in the laminar flow hood.\n\tNote: This container will be used for all remaining steps.\n\t\nPrepare slide or PC for endothelial cell seeding for monoculture experiment.\n\t\t\nCoat the functionalized slide or PC (step 1.11) with 1 ml fibronectin solution (25 μg/ml), on one side, covering the approximate area exposed to cell culture chamber.\nIncubate slides or PC in sterile incubator set at 37 °C for 1-2 hr.\nAfter incubation, aspirate the remaining solution using a glass aspirator pipette connected to a vacuum.\n\t\t\tNote: Slides may now be stored O/N at 4 °C for future use.\nFollow 1.12.2 steps only for preparing EC/SMC co-culture. Prepare and seed smooth muscle cell (SMC) culture for co-culture experiment.\n\t\t\nPlace silicone gasket on top of the slide (step 1.11), with dimensions of 75 mm by 50 mm outer diameter, inner diameter of 50 mm by 30 mm, thickness of 0.5 mm, and perforations which align with flow chamber vacuum.\nPrepare 1 ml SMC in 10% FBS/DMEM suspension. Neutralize 1 ml solution of 2 mg/ml collagen type-I with 7% NaHCO3 and 0.1 M NaOH solution to pH of 7.4, and mix with SMC suspension with final cell density of 2 x 106 cells/ml.\nSpread SMC solution within gasket and incubate slides at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min.",
    "After incubation, cover the slide with 25 ml 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) mixed in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) for 72 hr.\nCulture endothelial cells (ECs) on glass slide/polycarbonate membrane.\n\t\nSeed 1 ml ECs in 10% FBS/DMEM, with initial concentration of 6.0 x 105 cells/ml, on fibronectin surfaces of glass slide or polycarbonate membrane.\nIncubate cells in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 10% FBS for 120 min.\nCover slides containing cells with additional 10% FBS/DMEM, and place in incubator in 37 °C, 5% CO2 O/N, until 70%-80% confluent.\n2. Determination of Fluid Viscosity and Volumetric Flow Rate\nNote: Rotating viscometers are sensitive equipment, and the viscometer user manual should be consulted before calibrating, zeroing, or performing measurements.\nDetermine desired fluid shear (τ) from literature of the experiment’s targeted vasculature.\nMeasure 1% FBS/DMEM viscosity (μ), using a rotational viscometer.\nDetermine required volumetric flow rate (Q) from Poiseuille equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53224/53224eq1.jpg,\n\twhere τ = fluid shear, μ = viscosity, Q = vol. flow rate, w = chamber width, and h = chamber height).\nSet pump to flow rate derived in step 2.3, and use for all subsequent steps.\n3. Determination of Pulsatility Index\nNote: All connection ports within the system should be connected with appropriately sized lock-ring-to-barb, or female luer-to-barb connections. Connecting PVC tubing may then be connected to barb fittings, and circuit completed.\nConnect flow circuit as in Figure 2, with damping chamber (Figure 3) and ultrasonic flow meter in correct flow direction.\n\tNote: Ultrasonic flow meter is a sensitive piece of equipment, and the user manual should be consulted before use.\nFill flow circuit and reservoir with DI water, by ensuring reservoir outlet tube (to pump) is submerged within reservoir volume. Visualize flow waveform using a flow meter.",
    "Open air release valve on the damping chamber to change fluid/air volume ratio. Close air release valve at different fluid level intervals and calculate pulsatility index (PI = (VMax - VMin) / VMean) by using flow waveform peak (VMax), trough (VMin), and mean (VMean). Record PI values in notebook.\nMark resulting fluid level and PI on the damping chamber, using a felt tipped, permanent ink pen for future use. Determine desired PI levels from pathology literature11.\nSilicon Tube Formation- Optional, more advanced method of controlling pulsatility\n\t\nMix the silicone elastomer base and curing agent at different ratios (e.g., a base-to-crosslinker ratio from 10:1 to 36:1) for varied targeted elastic moduli, as illustrated previously.2\nFabricate silicone tubes by repeated dip-cure process, briefly dipping steel cannula (14 G) into silicone prepolymer mixture with a predetermined base-to-crosslinker ratio.\nPlace the prepolymer-coated cannula into an oven set at 60 °C for 4 hr to cure the polymer coating on the cannula, switching the direction in the middle of curing process.\nRepeat the dipping process with the same silicone elastomer mixture and place back in the oven for additional 4 hr, which results in ~0.3 mm thick tubes.\nRemove the ultrathin silicone tube from the stainless steel cannula.\nConnect tubes to flow circuit instead of damping chamber, and test PI for each as in 3.3.\n4. Pump Sterilization\nImmerse the flow chamber (Figure 2), PVC tubing, and gaskets in 10% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Wash with sterile DI before step 4.\nPlace the blood pump on a spare incubator shelf.\n\tNote: Incubator shelves should be stainless steel, and be able to support the weight of the entire flow circuit.",
    "Fill the flow circuit and reservoir with 10% H2O2 by ensuring reservoir outlet tube (to pump) is submerged within reservoir volume. Circulate H2O2 by pumping through circuit for 20 min in the laminar flow hood with UV light on.\nAspirate all H2O2 from tubing, and wash with sterile PBS by pumping through flow circuit.\n5. Flow Chamber Assembly\nNote: The flow chamber consists of an acrylic, custom made plate, with vacuum ports and inlet and outlet flow ports (see Figure 2). Chamber assembly consists of placing the flow chamber and gaskets on top of culture slides, properly aligned, and is described below.\nWarm up 1% FBS/DMEM in a 37 °C water bath and prepare flow chamber.\n\t\nTake EC slide out of media (from step 1.13) and place gasket on top with cell side up.\n(Optional) Take PC membrane out of media (from step 1.13) and place gasket on top with cell side up.
