    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection of bone marrow cells\nTiming: 30 min\nNote: Day 0\nThis step prepares the bone marrow cells including progenitors which will differentiate into bone marrow-derived macrophages after culture. The time it takes to start of culture in the bone marrow culture medium should be minimal to maximize cell yield and to avoid contamination.\nEuthanize mouse by an appropriate method approved by the supervising institution. Appropriately remove excess blood in the following steps.\nSoak with 70% ethanol. (Also see Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1])\nRemove skin and expose lower limb.\nCut major muscles near the base of the lower limb to expose the hip joint.\nCut femur near the base (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/339-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration describing steps 1–5.\nCut Achilles tendon and remove major muscles around tibia.\nRemove major muscles around femur (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/339-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustration describing steps 6 and 7.\nCut at knee joint.\nRemove major muscles around tibia, and remove fibula (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/339-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Illustration describing steps 8 and 9.\nRemove the epiphyses of femur and tibia so that the bone marrow can be accessed from the ends with a 23G needle. This can be confirmed by poking the ends with a needle (Also see Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nWash the bone marrow into a 50 mL tube by slowly injecting approximately 2–3 mL PBS per bone. The bone marrow will come out from the other end. Make sure the PBS does not backflow, to avoid contamination. Keep the bone marrow on ice.\nRepeat with other lower limb (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/339-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Illustration describing steps 10–12.\nOptional: For collection of bone marrow from 5 mice or more, or if collection takes more than 1 h, use DMEM without FBS for washing bone marrow.",
    "Centrifuge bone marrow suspension at 200 × g, 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant or aspirate PBS.\nOptional: To remove erythrocytes resuspend in 1× lyse buffer on ice, and let sit for 3 min. Add 10 mL DMEM (10% FBS 1% penicillin streptomycin) and centrifuge suspension at 200 × g, 5 min at 4°C, and repeat if necessary.\nDifferentiation into bone marrow-derived macrophages\nResuspend bone marrow (approx. 1 × 107 live cells per mouse) in 1 mL bone marrow culture medium, and filter through a 100 μm cell strainer.\nPipette suspension (approx. 1 × 107 live cells) into total volume of bone marrow culture medium (approx. 12 mL for 12 well plate). 6 well plates and 24 well plates can also be used.\nAdd bone marrow culture medium to wells (1 mL/well for 12 well plate). Culture at 37°C 5% CO2.\nAdd half this volume of bone marrow culture medium on day 4 (e.g., 500 μL/well for 12 well plate). Adherent cells should show 1–2 protrusions at low magnification.\nPreparation for in vitro experiment\nTiming: 10 min\nNote: Day 6\nThis step describes the preparation for in vitro stimulation using BMDMs. FBS contains signaling peptides etc. that may obscure, for example, detection of phosphorylation in response to stimulation of interest. Therefore, a period of serum-free culture before stimulation is recommended in such experiments. Overnight culture in serum-free medium does not have a marked impact on cell viability, but baseline Akt phosphorylation is suppressed which makes detection of phosphorylation in response to in vitro stimulation clearer.\nWash cells with sterile PBS, and change to DMEM 10% FBS, and continue culture at 37°C 5% CO2.\nOptional: For detection of phosphorylation signals etc., change to DMEM without FBS at this point.\nTiming: 10 min\nNote: Day 7 (2 h before in vitro experiment)",
    "Change medium to DMEM without FBS if not already changed.\nSampling from bone marrow-derived macrophage cultures\nTiming: 30 min to several hours\nThis step describes sampling from BMDM cultures. To minimize altered signaling events, or gene expression, sampling directly from the culture plate is recommended.\nChange medium to medium containing stimulation of interest.\nAfter stimulation, wash cells twice with PBS, and aspirate.\nFor creating a cell suspension, add 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (approx. 100 μL/well for 12 well plate) and incubate at 37°C for 3 min. Add DMEM (10% FBS, 1 mL/well for 12 well plate), dislodge the cells using a cell scraper, and transfer to a 5 mL round bottom tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g, 4°C for 3 min.\nSuspend cells in 1 mL FACS buffer for counting, and subsequent analysis.\nIf sampling of protein or RNA takes place later, freeze the washed culture plate with liquid nitrogen, and keep in −80°C freezer. In the following steps, add extraction buffer directly to the wells, and pipette repeatedly until no adherent cells remain. Optionally, a cell scraper may be used to dislodge the cells.\nFor extracting protein samples for western blot, add cell lysis buffer supplemented with 1× protease cocktail to the wells (approx. 100 μL/well for a 12 well plate), and transfer to a 1.5 mL sampling tube.\nSonicate for 5 min at 4°C, and vortex.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 10,000 × g and transfer supernatant to a 1.5 mL sampling tube. Avoid aspirating or contacting the sediment (Trouble shooting problem 3). 100–200 μg of protein is typically extracted.\nAdd 1/3 volume of 4× Laemmli buffer, and boil for 10 min.\nKeep at −20°C until SDS-PAGE.",
    "For extracting RNA using RNeasy mini kit, add 350 μL buffer RLT to the wells. Final elution should use 50–100 μL TE. 5–10 μg RNA is typically extracted. Keep at −80°C until gene expression analysis."
