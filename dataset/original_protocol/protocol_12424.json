    "NOTE: All subjects must give informed written consent before the experimental protocol. All procedures, consent forms, and the experimental protocol must be approved by the local Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects.\n1. Preparing the Subject for the Experiment\nRecruit participants from the local area and compensate them for their time. The participants must have normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and English as their first language.\n2. Stimuli\nChoose at least seven different categories from Battig and Montague9 to use in the target detection task explained below.\nChoose nouns from the category norms you selected in Battig and Montaque9 to use as targets as well as other words from separate categories to use as decoys in the target detection task explained below. Make sure the set of words collected in this step is large enough so each subject can be tested with many trails without repeatedly using the same target.\nChoose nouns from the Penn Treebank corpus, with frequency higher than 1 per million10 to use as nontargets and distractors to be tested against the nontarget nouns in the memory task explained below. Make sure the set of words collected in this step is also large enough so that repeatedly using a word can be avoided for a given subject.\nChoose words 4 or 5 letters in length. Trials can be divided into 4-letter words trials and 5-letter words trials. Use only 4-letter words for 4-letter words trials, and 5-letter words for 5-letter words trials.\nFor each trial, randomly select 1 target and 1 decoy that are prepared in step 2.2; from the set that are prepared in step 2.3, randomly select 7 words as nontargets and 5 words as memory task distractors. Make sure the words are never repeated in a given trial.",
    "3. Collect Information from the Participant\nBefore the actual experiment begins, add a section into your experiment, or create a piece of paper to record information about the participant (name, age, handedness, gender).\n4. Display Instructions\nMake sure the participants understand and fully read the instructions.\nClearly state that there are two tasks in the experiment, first the participants have to detect the presence or absence of a target noun in a displayed category. Second, participants will be tested on other words in the sequence, so participants must try to remember all the words in the RSVP task described below.\nMake the response keys clear and easy to remember.\n5. Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)\nUse A 21-inch CRT monitor, or equivalent (refresh rate = 85 Hz, resolution = 1,280 x 1,024 pixels) to display the stimuli. Use standard scientific software and a stimuli presentation toolbox to run the experiment. Present the words in black and Courier font (size 14) on a white background.\nStart each trial with a display of the target category for 1.2 sec, followed by a fixation cross for 500 msec and a blank screen for 200 msec. Next, present 8 nouns using SOAs of either 120, 240, or 360 msec/item making sure distractor nouns are never used as target nouns across trials. Each trial takes about 10 sec.\n\tNOTE: in total, there were 96 trials and 8 practice trials in the exemplar experiment 1, including 16 repetitions for each condition. A typical session with this experimental design will take a subject 15–20 min to complete.\n6. Target Detection Task",
    "Prepare two nouns, one belonging to the target category and the other not belonging to the target category (a decoy noun), for every trial. In half of the trials, present the target noun. And in the other half of the trials, present the decoy noun. Ensure the target position is never one of the first or last positions in the presentation.\nAfter the RSVP, give participants 2 sec to respond “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether the presentation contained a word from the target category.\n7. Recognition Memory Task for Nontargets\nPresent the first recognition memory task for nontargets after the 2-sec interval for response to the categorical task.\n\tNOTE: this first memory task is always a word either immediately before or immediately after the target word in the sequence, or in the middle of the sequence for trials not containing a target word.\nShow the test word randomly on the right or left side of the screen next to a word that was not in the sequence, acquired from protocol step 2.2.\nKeep these words on the screen until participants make a response using the left or right arrow key, corresponding to the position of the word that was displayed in the sequence.\nPresent the second memory test after the response, using a word in the sequence not directly before or after the target, to keep participants from paying extra attention to the words around the target. Use the same procedure as the first memory task.\nTo avoid fatigue or eye strain, encourage participants to take rests between experimental trials. Participants usually do not need more than a few seconds to rest between consecutive trials.\n8. Counterbalanced SOA Memory Task",
    "If interested in examining AB effects on more nontarget items, in a second experiment, use the same RSVP procedure with a counterbalanced, between-subject design.\n\tNOTE: In the demonstrative study, the SOAs of 120 or 240 msec were counterbalanced between participants. Other SOAs can be tested as well. This experiment does not need to be conducted with the same participants or in the same sessions as the first experiment.\nUse three memory tests after the detection task for this experiment. Make sure that the test words are equally likely to be from positions 2 through 7 around the target for target present trials, or around the decoy noun in the target absent trials.\n\tNOTE: the procedure and button press is the same as the first experiment.\n9. Wrapping up\nDe-brief with the participants if they are interested in the purpose of the study. To protect participant’s privacy, identifying information about participants (e.g., name) should be removed and replaced with number coding to be affiliated with the data file.\nIf needed, when data from multiple participants are collected, use ANOVAs or planned contrast t-tests to compare memory performances in target present versus target absent conditions.\n\tNOTE: We suggest to focus on the data from correctly answered trials of the target detection task, as participant’s attention may be unfocused in incorrectly answered trials of the target detection task.\nSubscription Required.
