    "Plasmid planning and construction Choose the ∆hfq strain of interest and scan the genome for natural product BGCs using antiSMASH (Medema et al., 2011). This protocol will focus on Xenorhabdus_∆hfq as model organism for Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus. For generating a ∆hfq strain in other proteobacteria, please refer to suitable methods for strain generation.Streak the ∆hfq strain on a LB agar plate using a sterile inoculation loop in order to obtain single colonies. Incubate the inoculated plate at 30 °C for at least 72 h; look daily for growth and examine the strain for antibiotic resistance, pigmentation, swarming, or other phenotypical characteristics.Note: For swarming strains, increase agar concentration of solid medium up to 30 g/L. Store the grown plates at 18 °C for up to two weeks. For long-term storage, prepare glycerol stocks from fresh overnight cultures [720 μL of glycerol (50% v/v) and 1,280 μL of culture].Inoculate 5 mL of LB medium in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask with a single colony from the plate and incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C rotating at 200 rpm. Purify chromosomal DNA from 1 mL (~2 × 109 cells) of bacterial culture with Monarch Genomic DNA Purification kit. Dissolve the DNA pellet in 100 μL of elution buffer or dH2O. Store dissolved DNA at 4 °C during the experimental period or freeze it at -20 °C for long-term storage.Streak E. coli ST18_pCEP-kmR (Cluster Expression Plasmid) on LB agar containing 5-ALA (50 μg/mL) and kanamycin (50 μg/mL). Incubate overnight at 37 °C. Store the plates at 4 °C for up to two months. For long-term storage, follow step A3.Note: The plasmid is also available as pCEP-cmR (E. Bode et al., 2015). This protocol will focus on pCEP-kmR.",
    "Inoculate 10 mL of LB medium supplemented with 5-ALA (50 μg/mL) and kanamycin (50 μg/mL) with a single colony and cultivate the cells overnight at 37 °C shaking at 200 rpm.Note: Always add 5-ALA (50 μg/mL) for cultivation of E. coli ST18 to the media, except in step C9.Isolate pCEP plasmid DNA (Figure 2) (low copy vector) from 10 mL of culture (E. Bode et al., 2015), following the manual instruction of Qiagen Plasmid Mini Prep kit.Note: For higher yield of the low copy vector pCEP, extract the vector from E. coli EC100 λpir cells, cultivate in SOC medium, or use Qiagen Midi Prep kit and extract plasmid DNA from 100 mL of overnight culture. The cloning strategy is based on the HiFi DNA assembly method and carried out with the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix following the instruction manual.Use Geneious Prime® and design a primer pair of 20–25 bp targeting the first 300–600 bp (homologous region) of the gene of interest (Figure 1b) with homologous arms (overlaps) (Table 1) to the pCEP vector (Figure 2c). For later validation of the promoter exchange in Xenorhabdus_∆hfq, design an individual verification primer Vxyz-rv binding approximately 20–100 bp downstream of the homologous region (Figure 3). Its melting temperature (Tm) should match the Tm of the verification primer VpCEP-fw that binds to the pCEP vector (Table 2, Figure 3).Perform PCR on the genomic DNA, extracted in step A4, with Phusion polymerase. Amplify the first 300–600 bp of the target gene (Figure 1b). Run PCR on an agarose gel (1% agarose in TAE-buffer, stain with Midori Green Advance 0.5 µL/100 mL). Use the 100 bp DNA ladder for determination of the right fragment size and cut the appropriate DNA fragment out of the gel.",
    "Use Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System and extract the fragment from the gel slice.Note: Other polymerases can be used for amplification, especially for GC-rich DNA. If no fragment is obtained via PCR, sometimes a 1:10 dilution of genomic DNA with deionized H2O is helpful. An optimization of the PCR reaction mixture by adding more DMSO or additional MgCl2 might be beneficial. Adjust the PCR protocol and cycle to the respective polymerase. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4709/bioprotoc-13-13-4709-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "Perform a restriction of pCEP with enzymes NdeI and PstI (Figure 2). The restriction sites are located in the multiple cloning site of pCEP and enable the ligation of the prepared gene fragment via its homologous arms in front of the PBAD promoter, which is located upstream of the NdeI restriction site (Figure 2).Run the restricted plasmid on an agarose gel (1% agarose in TAE buffer). Use 1 kb DNA ladder and determine the linear 4.84 kb plasmid backbone. Cut the fragment out of the gel and extract it from the gel slice with Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System.Determine the DNA concentration of the plasmid backbone and insert fragments using a NanoDrop. Ligate the fragments using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix for 1 h at 50 °C, following the manual’s instructions. Additionally, set up a ligation mix that contains the restricted pCEP vector only and replace the volume of insert with dH2O as a control for restriction efficiency. After ligation, construct samples can be stored at -20 °C.Note: Perform ligation in a PCR tube in a PCR thermocycler. If no clones are obtained, variate the vector/insert ratio. Transformation and validation of plasmid constructs Thaw the competent E. coli ST18 cells on ice. Transform 1–10 μL of the ligated construct (depending on the transformation method) into the donor cells via heat shock (a) or electroporation (b) (Figure 1b).Thaw 50 μL of chemically competent cells on ice for 10 min. Add 5–10 μL of pCEP_xyz ligation mixture and incubate on ice for 30 min. Heat shock the cells for 45 s at 42 °C and subsequently incubate on ice for 2 min. Add 200 μL of LB with 5-ALA (50 μg/mL) medium. Let cells regenerate at 37 °C and 800 rpm in a ThermoMixer for 1 h.",
    "Add 1–4 μL of pCEP_xyz ligation mixture to 50 μL of electro competent cells and mix well by pipetting up and down. Pipette the mixture onto the bottom of a pre-chilled electroporation cuvette (1 mm). Use Gene Pulser Xcell and pulse at 1.8 kV, 200 Ω, and 25 μF. Immediately add 950 μL of pre-warmed LB medium + 5-ALA (50 μg/mL), transfer the cells into a 1.5 mL reaction tube, and let cells recover at 37 °C shaking at 800 rpm in a ThermoMixer for 1 h.Plate the transformed cells (Figure 1c) on LB agar containing 5-ALA and kanamycin. Incubate the agar plates overnight at 37 °C. Usually, colonies will appear the next day.For cells transformed via heat shock: plate 100–200 μL of the transformed E. coli pCEP_xyz. Spin down the remaining culture at 17,000× g for 15 s, decant the supernatant, dissolve cells in the remaining liquid, and plate them on a second LB agar plate.For electroporated cells: plate 100 μL on a first plate, then spin down the remaining culture at 17,000× g for 15 s, decant the supernatant, dissolve cells in the remaining liquid, and plate them on a second LB agar plate.Screen for the accurate E. coli_pCEP-xyz donor by checking at least 10 single colonies by colony PCR: pick colonies with a sterile toothpick or sterile tip and suspend the cells in the colony PCR reaction mix. Set up a master plate with the corresponding selective antibiotic and 5-ALA by streaking each respective clone on the plate to save it for later applications.Use verification primers VpCEP-fw and VpCEP-rv (Table 2) (Figure 2a and 2b) for amplification of the ligated fragment. A 234 bp fragment is the result for an empty vector.",
    "Note: Alternatively, lyse colony material in 50 μL of dH2O and take 1 μL from the lysate for PCR. If the colony PCR gives no result, check your plasmid via restriction. Therefore, set up a small overnight culture from the respective mutant (5 mL in 50 mL flasks) in LB medium + antibiotic. Extract the plasmid from 5 mL of overnight culture and digest it with NdeI and PstI to obtain the ligated fragment size or use a single restriction enzyme that cleaves your plasmid twice. Table 2.

    "Mating procedure Inoculate 5 mL of LB in a 50 mL flask with a single acceptor strain colony Xenorhabdus_∆hfq. Cultivate at 30 °C and 200 rpm overnight.Note: For experiments with Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, the colonies should not be older than 10 days. In parallel, inoculate the desired E. coli_pCEP-xyz donor in 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with 5-ALA and kanamycin in a 50 mL flask. Cultivate at 37 °C and 200 rpm overnight.On the next day, inoculate the acceptor strain in 5 mL of fresh LB medium in two different ratios from the acceptor overnight culture—1:25 and 1:50—and incubate until OD600 = 0.6–1.0 at 30 °C while shaking at 200 rpm. Measure all OD600 with UV-vis-spectrophotometer Biochrom Libra S60.In parallel, inoculate the donor E. coli_pCEP-xyz strain in 5 mL of LB medium + 5-ALA in two different ratios from the donor E. coli_pCEP-xyz overnight culture—1:50 and 1:100—and incubate until OD600 = 0.6–1.0 at 37 °C while shaking at 200 rpm. The OD is reached after 3–5 h.Note: Prepare glycerol stocks from the overnight culture of the E. coli mutant for long-term storage. If the donor cells reach the appropriate OD earlier than the acceptor, store them on ice until the acceptor is ready. When the OD600 is appropriate, pipette 1 mL from the acceptor strain into a reaction tube. Spin down the cells at 17,000× g for 1 min. Decant the supernatant.Spin down 1 mL of the E. coli_pCEP_xyz donor at 17,000× g for 1 min.Wash the E. coli_pCEP_xyz donor cells twice with 1 mL of LB medium to eliminate 5-ALA. Discard the supernatant.Dissolve the pelleted cells in 400 μL of LB medium.",
    "Combine donor and acceptor cells in a drop on an LB agar plate (do NOT add 5-ALA or antibiotics in this step) in the recommended acceptor:donor ratios: 1:3 (25 μL:75 μL) and 3:1 (75 μL:25 μL) (Figure 4a). Mix the cells in the drop by gently agitating the plate; do not spread the cells over the whole plate!Incubate the plates for 3 h at 37 °C and subsequently switch to 30 °C for 21 h. Bacterial conjugation happens via the rolling circle mechanism. pCEP-xyz integrates via its homologous region “-xyz” into the genome of the acceptor strain, replacing the natural promoter by the inducible PBAD promoter (Figure 1d, Figure 3), generating the promoter exchange mutant ∆hfq_pCEP_xyz (Figure 1e, Figure 3).Note: Do not exceed the incubation time at 37 °C as Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus will not survive. If time is a problem, just incubate at 30 °C for 24 h, which also works well in most cases. Selection for promoter exchange mutants Scrape the cell plaque (Figure 4b) from the agar carefully with a sterile inoculation loop and suspend the cells in 1 mL of LB medium by pipetting up and down.Inoculate the selection plate for ∆hfq_pCEP_xyz promoter exchange mutants by spreading 300 μL of the cell suspension on a large Petri dish containing LB agar + kanamycin (without 5-ALA!) by using a sterile Drigalski spatula or a glass pipette. Incubate the plates at 30 °C for at least 72 h and check for colonies daily (Figure 4c).Note: Depending on the target gene, colonies may appear early, after 24 h of incubation, or late, after 72 h, if bacterial growth is severely affected by the silencing of the gene by promoter exchange. Streak 1–10 single ∆hfq_pCEP_xyz colonies on an LB agar plate + selective antibiotic (master plate) (Figure 4d).",
    "Perform colony PCR from selected cells: pick colony material from the plate and suspend the cells directly in the PCR samples, or dissolve material from the colony in 50 μL of dH2O or 25 μL of NaOH (0.02 M) in a PCR tube, and lyse cells at 99 °C for 5 min in the thermocycler to obtain genomic DNA. Take 1 μL for PCR and use VpCEP-fw (Table 2) and the corresponding individual verification primer Vxyz-rv (Figure 5) binding downstream of the homologous region in the genome, designed in step A9.Note: If no fragment is obtained by colony PCR, extract genomic DNA described in step A for PCR. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4709/bioprotoc-13-13-4709-g003.jpgFigure 4.

(c) Promoter exchange mutants Xenorhabdus_∆hfq_pCEP_xyz after plating on LB-km agar and 48 h of incubation at 30 °C. (d) Master plate on LB-km agar of selected mutants from plate depicted in (c).Production cultures and HPLC/MS analysis Inoculate 5 mL of LB + selective antibiotic in a 50 mL flask with a single ∆hfq_pCEP_xyz colony. Prepare respective cultures from the ∆hfq acceptor strain and the corresponding WT strain as controls.Next day: wash the cells twice with LB medium to eliminate antibiotics.Inoculate 100 mL of LB medium in 500 mL flasks with washed cells from the pre-cultures 0.1% (v/v) and induce all cultures with L-arabinose (final concentration 0.2%). Cultivate for 48–72 h at 30 °C and 140 rpm on a rotary shaker.Transfer the cultures in 50 mL plastic tubes with a threaded cover and spin down the cells at 3,220× g for 20 min.Note: Extend centrifugation time if the cells do not form a solid pellet.",
    "Transfer the cell-free supernatant into new plastic tubes.For HPLC/MS analysis: Pipette 50 μL of the supernatant in a reaction tube and extract it with 500 μL of methanol by mixing vigorously for 20 s on a vortex. Centrifuge the samples at 17,000× g for 20 min.Pipette a sample of 50–120 μL into a HPLC vial for HPLC/MS analysis (Figure 5). Use DataAnalysis to analyze the HPLC/MS data.Freeze the remaining cell-free supernatant at -80 °C.Subsequently freeze dry the supernatant in a lyophilisator (Lyovapor L-300).The lyophilizate can be stored at -20 °C for further investigations.Dissolve the lyophilizate in 10 mL of deionized water and use the 10-fold concentrate for further analysis.Note: Adjust solvents to specific testing conditions. To consider compounds that are located in the cell membrane, freeze dry the whole culture."
