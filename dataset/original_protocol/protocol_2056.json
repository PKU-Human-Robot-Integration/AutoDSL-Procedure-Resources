However, users can perform the experiment using in-house made stock solutions (Zhang et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nPlating fibroblasts onto an XF HS miniplate.\nSeed human fibroblasts onto wells B-G of the XF HS miniplate containing 100 μL of fibroblast medium at 5∼6 × 103 cells/well (∼90% confluency).\nCritical: When seeding, make sure to uniformly disperse the cells at the bottom of the well. Do not seed the cells on wells A and H of the miniplate as these are for blank/background correction.\nIncubate the XF HS miniplate in the 5% CO2 37°C incubator for 18–24 h.\nHydrating sensor cartridge.\nPut cartridges into the laminar flow hood.\nSeparate the sensor cartridge from the utility plate and place the sensor cartridge upside down.\nAdd 200 μL of XF Calibrant solution into each well of the Utility plate.\nAdd 400 μL of XF Calibrant solution into the moat chambers around the outside of the wells.\nReturn the XF Sensor cartridge to the Utility plate containing XF Calibrant solution.\nPlace the cartridge assembly in a non-CO2 37°C incubator for 18–24 h.\nCritical: The non-CO2 37°C incubator should be kept humidified at 100% to prevent evaporation of the XF Calibrant solution.\nPreparing XF HS miniplate for assay.\nNext day, verify the condition of the cells in the XF HS miniplate before starting the assay ensuring the cells are well distributed.\nNote: Make sure the cells are well-attached at 80%–90% density as single cells, not as aggregates.",

However, the optimal dose of FCCP may vary depending on cell context. Determine and identify the optimal FCCP concentration to provoke maximal respiration of your cells.\nMove a hydrated sensor cartridge assembly from the non-CO2 37°C incubator to the laminar flow hood and load the diluted compounds into the indicated ports of the hydrated sensor cartridge.\nAdd 20 μL of diluted oligomycin solution into Port A of the hydrated sensor cartridge.\nAdd 22 μL of diluted FCCP solution into Port B of the hydrated sensor cartridge.\nAdd 25 μL of diluted rotenone/antimycin A solution into Port C of the hydrated sensor cartridge.\nNote: Port D of the hydrated sensor cartridge should be empty unless users want to test their own chemicals.\nHit ‘START’ and run the ‘Mito Stress Test’ program of the XF HS Mini Analyzer.\nPlace the compounds-loaded, hydrated sensor cartridge assembly onto the load position of XF HS Mini Analyzer.\nNote: See the user manual for operation details of the XF HS Mini Analyzer (https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/user-manual-flux-analyzer-xf-hs-mini-extracellular-5994-1961en-agilent.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/user-manual-flux-analyzer-xf-hs-mini-extracellular-5994-1961en-agilent.pdf]).",
    "Running metabolic analysis.\nOnce the calibration step of the hydrated sensor cartridge is completed, switch the Utility plate with the XF HS miniplate containing cells and click ‘CONTINUE’.\nDetermining protein concentration.\nOnce the assay is completed, take out the assayed XF HS miniplate from the cartridge-miniplate assembly and carefully aspirate the medium from each well of the miniplate without disturbing the attached cells.\nWash out the cells with 200 μL of DPBS once.\nAfter aspirating DPBS, add 200 μL of Bradford dye reagent into each well of the miniplate and mix well to prepare a crude cell lysate.\nMeasure each sample optical density with a spectrometer to assess the protein concentration.\nAlternatives: In this protocol, we used a Synergy HTX multi-mode reader.
