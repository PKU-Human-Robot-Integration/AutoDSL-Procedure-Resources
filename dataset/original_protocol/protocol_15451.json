    "An endotracheal tube size appropriate for the patient's age for endotracheal intubation should be chosen. We use the formula: ETT size = age(yr)/4 +4.\nWe chose a one size smaller uncuffed endotracheal tube to be inserted nasally, in case the endotracheal intubation fails after the patient is put to sleep.\nBefore nasal insertion of the tube, we measure the approximate distance from the nose to the level of the vocal cords, which is usually at the level of mid thyroid cartilage.\nAfter the patient is anesthetized, and after a failed endotracheal intubation attempt and failed ventilation, the well lubricated one size smaller endotracheal tube will be inserted nasally to a level just above the vocal cords.\nOne has to ensure a good seal of the mouth and nares of the patient. The anesthesia circuit can be attached to the ET tube connector, and with appropriate seal of the mouth and the nose, the lungs can be adequately ventilated.\nAfter sealing the nose and the mouth, lungs are adequately ventilated as confirmed by ETCO2 waveform, chest rising of the patient and good oxygen saturation on pulse oximeter.Subscription Required.
