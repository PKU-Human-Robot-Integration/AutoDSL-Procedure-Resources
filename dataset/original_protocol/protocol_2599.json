    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDigestion of mouse spleens\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this section, spleens are harvested and digested with an enzyme cocktail mix to release stromal cells. Upon completion of the digestion, the stromal cell fraction is separated from the hematopoietic cells.\nHarvest spleens.\nEuthanize mice using either CO2 or other approved methods.\nLay euthanized mice on their right flank and spray body area with 70% ethanol.\nUsing scissors, cut through the skin and peritoneum to expose the spleen.\nHarvest the spleen with forceps and place individual spleens in 1–2 mL of harvest media and keep on ice.\nNote: Remove external tissue connected to the spleen.\nPlace one spleen in the middle of a Petri dish.\nLoad two 1 mL syringes equipped with 26G needles with digestion media.\nInject 2 mL of digestion media evenly across the spleen.\nNote: We inject around 200 μL in one area of the spleen then inject in another area until the entire spleen is injected with 2 mL of digestion media. Spleens should swell and become lighter in color due to the injection of the enzyme mix (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2258-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Note: If more than one spleen is processed, use a new petri dish and repeat steps 2–5 for the next spleen. Continue until all spleens are injected and transferred with the digestion media into tubes.\nCritical: We routinely digest up to 16 individual mouse spleens within one experiment. However, when processing more than 5–6 spleens, we recommend splitting samples in two or more batches for the processing to ensure a standard digestion time for each sample. For example, to process 10 spleens, we suggest injecting the enzyme mix in the first 5 spleens, transfer them in the water bath and start a timer, then continue with the next 5 spleens.\nTransfer tubes into a pre-warmed water bath set to 37°C and incubate for 30 min.\nAfter incubation, remove tubes from the water bath and place them back at 20°C–22°C.\nUsing a 1 mL pipette, thoroughly gently mix spleens 90 times.\nCritical: The mixing step is indispensable to achieve optimal cell recovery.\nNote: Spleens should be digested completely with no fragments left. If not, leave undisturbed until remaining visible pieces of tissue settle to the bottom of the tube. Transfer supernatant into a 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of FACS buffer without taking the undigested pieces of spleen and keep this on ice. Repeat digestion by adding 1 mL of digestion media to the undigested pieces of spleen and incubate for 15 min at 37°C. Repeat step 8 following the second incubation and pool together the two digested fractions in the 15 mL tube that contains the first fraction in FACS buffer. Skip step 9 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). See also problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nAdd 14 mL of FACS buffer to each digested spleen and centrifuge for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C.",
    "Remove supernatant and perform red blood cell lysis by resuspending spleen cells with 1 mL of RBC lysis buffer.\nAfter 2 min incubation at 20°C–22°C, wash cells by adding 10 mL of FACS buffer and centrifuge for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C.\nRemove supernatant, resuspend spleen cells in 5 mL of FACS buffer and filter cell suspension through 75 μM nylon mesh into a new 10 or 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge cells for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant using a vacuum trap system.\nNote: It is important here to use a vacuum trap to remove all the supernatant from the tubes as the next step requires low volume of buffer.\nAdd 250 μL of FACS buffer into each tube then add 35 μL of anti-mouse CD45 microbeads.\nNote: we found there is no need to strictly follow the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001245.PDF] for the volume of beads that is required for CD45+ cell depletion. The amount and dilution of microbeads used here is enough to perform a robust depletion of CD45+ cells for stromal cell enrichment and further analysis. If working with spleens with higher total cellularity than steady state spleens (for example from infected mice), we recommend to manually count and determine the total cellularity in the samples that need to be enriched. Users can then scale up the volume of FACS buffer and beads. As an example, we typically resuspend spleen cells in 500 μL of FACS buffer and add 60 μL of CD45 microbeads during the peak of the immune response following LCMV infection.",
    "Note: If the goal of the experiment is to perform cell sorting of stromal cells for subsequent analysis, we recommend including anti-mouse Ter119 microbeads in addition to CD45 microbeads to deplete residual red blood cells and their precursors that will be enriched in the stromal cell fraction. There is no need to include Ter119 microbeads if stromal cells are analyzed by flow cytometry.\nResuspend cell pellets and incubate for 15 min on ice.\nWash cells by adding 5 mL of FACS buffer and centrifuge cells for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant using vacuum trap and resuspend cells in 500 μL of FACS buffer. Keep cells on ice.\nAttach the QuadroMACS Separator to the MACS MultiStand and place an LS Column in the separator for each spleen sample. Place a reservoir under the LS Column.\nNote: We slightly modified the depletion protocol from manufacturer's instructions[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/upload/assets/IM0001245.PDF], as indicated below in steps 20–25 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nPrepare the LS Column by rinsing with 3 mL of FACS buffer on top of the column and let the buffer run through (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nWait until the buffer has completely run through and remove the reservoir. Place a 10 or 15 mL collection tube under the LS Column.\nApply the spleen cell suspension onto the prepared LS Column (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nCritical: Stromal cells do not express CD45 and are not retained within the column. It is critical to collect the negative fraction that flows through the column because it contains the enriched stromal cells. See also problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nOnce the cells have completely run through, add 500 μL of FACS buffer to the tube that had the cell suspension in step 18. to collect any remaining cells and apply this supernatant onto the column.",
    "Once the buffer has completely run through, wash the column once with 1 mL then 2 times with 3.5 mL of FACS buffer. The total volume of in the collection tube should be 9 mL.\nPut collection tubes on ice. Those contain the enriched stromal cells (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G and 1H).\nNote: We expect to obtain between 1 to 5 million cells following enrichment.\nNote: To collect the CD45+ cell fraction, remove the column from the QuadroMACS Separator and flush with FACS buffer into a separate tube.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Injection of the enzyme mix into the spleen, related to step 5\nFlow cytometry staining of spleen stromal cells\nTiming: 1.5 h\nEnriched stromal cells will be stained with antibodies to phenotype diverse subsets present in the spleen. We stain our samples in FACS tubes. Staining can also be performed in a round-bottom 96-well plate. If analyzing mouse white pulp stromal cells, we recommend using one spleen per staining. This is because some white pulp stromal cell subsets are numerically low in the spleen (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). For live versus dead cell discrimination, we recommend using a bright marker such as DAPI or Propidium Iodide (PI). These two markers are not compatible with intracellular staining (ICS). If ICS is required, we routinely use Zombie fixable viability dye that is added directly into the surface stain cocktail mix (refer to manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/live-dead]). We provide a table below with details of the antibodies used to identify the main subsets of white and rep pulp stromal cells from the mouse spleen. Users should check their own FACS configuration and adapt the antibodies accordingly. To enumerate cellularity, we add counting beads (Sphero calibration particles) just before acquisition in each sample. Alternatively, users can manually count their samples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2258-Fig2.jpg",

We recommend using unstained stromal cells as unstained negative control on the FACS machine. We use compensation beads and not enriched stromal cells for single stain controls to adjust compensations on the flow cytometer.\nCentrifuge remaining cells for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C.\nRemove supernatant, resuspend stromal cells in 1 mL of FACS buffer and transfer into FACS tubes.\nCentrifuge cells for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend each sample with 100 μL of stromal cell cocktail mix 1, made in FACS buffer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2258_5.csv\nNote: We tested directly conjugated anti-MAdCAM-1 antibodies and found that the positive signal was too dim for ready analysis. We now use Biotin-conjugated MAdCAM-1. If the experiment does not require a stain for marginal zone reticular cells, the use of this antibody is not necessary and the second incubation with streptavidin is not required.\nIncubate for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.",
    "Following incubation, wash cells by adding 1 mL of FACS buffer and centrifuge cells for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend cells with 100 μL stromal cell cocktail mix 2, made in FACS buffer (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2258_6.csv\nIncubate for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nFollowing incubation, wash cells by adding 1 mL of FACS buffer and centrifuge cells for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C.\nOptional: If intracellular staining is required, prepare Fixation/Permeabilization buffer by diluting 1 part of the Fixation/Permeabilization Concentrate with 3 parts of Fixation/Permeabilization Diluent from the eBioscience Foxp3/Transcription Factor staining buffer set. Centrifuge cells for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C, aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells with 100 μL of Fixation/Permeabilization working solution. Incubate for 45 min at 20°C–22°C, in the dark. Prepare a 1× working solution of Permeabilization Buffer by mixing 1 part of 10× Permeabilization Buffer from the eBioscience Foxp3/Transcription Factor staining buffer set with 9 parts of distilled water. Following the fixation incubation, wash cells by adding 1 mL of Permeabilization Buffer and centrifuge cells for 5 min, 500 × g, 4°C. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 μL of intracellular antibody mix, diluted in Permeabilization buffer. Incubate cells for 45 min at 4°C and in the dark.

Keep samples at 4°C and in the dark until acquisition of the flow cytometer. Skip steps 36 and 37, below.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend cells with 150 μL of FACS buffer.",
    "Add 20 μL of 10 μg/mL PI or 20 μL of 5 μM DAPI to each sample and keep samples at 4°C and in the dark until acquisition of the flow cytometer.\nJust prior to acquisition, vortex and add 20 μL of counting beads per sample.\nAcquire samples on a FACS machine.\nNote: We have used both FACSFortessa (BD) and Cytek Aurora machines for our studies, and FlowJo software for analysis.\nOptional: For single cell RNA sequencing, we sorted populations of interest with a BD FACS Aria III. Spleen stromal cells are fragile and we recommend sorting cells with a 100 μM nozzle and 20 psi, without exceeding a speed rate of 5,000 events per second. We sorted cells directly in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Following cell sorting, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS with 0.01% BSA and single cell RNA sequencing was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-gene-expression?utm_medium=search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=sem-goog-2022-website-page-ra_g-chromium-brand-apac&useroffertype=website-page&userresearcharea=ra_g&userregion=apac&userrecipient=customer&usercampaignid=7011P000001mDXlQAM&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3oX29Kib-wIVTiQrCh0XIA2wEAAYASABEgI2c_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds] (10X Genomics)."
