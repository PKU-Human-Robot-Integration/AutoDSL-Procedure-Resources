    "1. Patterning Conducting Polymers on Textile\nFix a 10 cm x 10 cm textile sheet on a planar surface for easy handling during the process. For the textile, use a 100% interlock knit polyester fabric with a thickness of 300 µm and a knit direction stretch capability up to 50%.\nTo make a mask containing the patterning design, use a 125 µm-thick polyimide film; an example of the pattern is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\t\nUse a laser cutter (e.g., Protolaser S, LPKF) to pattern the polyimide mask10; the pattern design of an electrode is illustrated in Figure 1.\nCoat the PDMS formulation (10:1 base to curing agent ratio) on top of the mask (polyimide film) using an automatic tape casting tool (K control print-coater, doctor blade) with a wet film thickness of 200 µm and at a 6 m/min coating speed. Use about 0.5 mL for a mask of 3 cm x 5 cm. Perform this process under the fume hood.\nGently transfer the fabric to the PDMS-coated mask. Leave for 10 min, after which the PDMS should be fully absorbed in the textile structure.\nCure the sample in an air-oven at 100 °C for 10 min.\nPrepare the conducting polymer:PEDOT:PSS dispersion (80 mL), ethylene glycol (20 mL), 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (40 µL), and 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (1 mL) in the fume hood.\nBrush-coat the PEDOT:PSS solution on the PDMS-free area of the textile until a homogenous penetration of the solution is obtained. Repeat this step to achieve a uniform pattern color. Apply about 1 mL/cm2.\nCure the fabric at 110 °C for 1 h to dry the PEDOT:PSS solution. Reduce the temperature to 60 °C for textiles that are sensitive to high-temperature treatment, like nylon.\n2. Organic Device Fabrication",
    "NOTE: The protocol in Section 1 describes the selective deposition of conducting materials on textiles. The following sections will describe the additional steps needed to fabricate organic devices, like stretch sensors, OECT transistors, cutaneous electrodes, and capacitive sensors.\nTo fabricate stretch sensors, shown in Figure 3a, pattern the electrode lines on the textile, as described in Section 1, steps 1.1-1.5.\n\tNOTE: An example of the pattern design is shown in Figure 3a. The fabrication of such sensors does not require any additional steps.\nTo fabricate the transistor design shown in Figure 3b, pattern the transistor arrays on a nylon woven ribbon following the steps described in Section 1. Slightly modify the PDMS annealing and PEDOT:PSS curing steps to avoid the thermal degradation of nylon by curing at 60 °C for a longer time.\nFor the fabrication of cutaneous electrodes, shown in Figure 3c, deposit an ionic gel on the patterned PEDOT:PSS textiles.\n\t\nPrepare an ionic liquid gel mixture containing the ionic liquid, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-ethyl sulfate; the cross-linking agent, poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate; and the photoinitiator, 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone at a (v/v) ratio of 0.6/0.35/0.05, respectively.\nCoat the PEDOT:PSS electrode with ionic liquid (20 µL/cm2) and add the ionic liquid gel mixture from step 2.3.1 (25 µL/cm2) by drop casting.\nExpose to UV light (365 nm) to initiate a crosslinking reaction for 10-15 min, until the gel solidifies. Perform this step in the fume hood. Use a UV-protective cage during UV exposure.\nFor capacitive sensor fabrication, use PEDOT:PSS textile electrodes insulated with an insulating material (Figure 3d).\n\t\nInsulate the keyboard-like PEDOT:PSS electrodes using the PDMS; the keyboard design can be seen in Figure 2b. Dispense the PDMS formulation on top of the fabric and remove the excess with a squeegee.",
    "Place the fabric in an oven at 100 °C for 10 min. Perform this step in the fume hood.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
