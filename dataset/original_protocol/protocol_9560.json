    "All animal work was approved by the University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources.\n1. Preparation of tissue culture media\nCulture all explants in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (1x DMEM) with 1% v/v penicillin-streptomycin and 200 µM L-ascorbic acid in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For the initial 48 h pretreatment, culture each explant in 70 mL of culture media supplemented with 100 nM dexamethasone74. After pretreatment, culture limbs for 7 more days without dexamethasone, changing media every 48-72 h.\n\tNOTE: Addition of serum, such as fetal bovine serum, to the culture media is not advised consistent with recommendations provided by Wunderli, Blache, and Snedeker57. In brief, serum-free conditions better represent the avascular, nutrient-poor tendon microenvironment that exists in vivo. Furthermore, serum supplementation can promote tissue degradation under certain culture conditions75 and stimulate cell proliferation and migration out of tissue, both features of tendon pathology57.\nFor the unloaded group, culture each explant in 70 mL of media. For the baseline tension and static impingement groups, each platform requires approximately 125 mL of culture media to keep the limb submerged. This volume can vary depending on the positioning of the upper leg in the grips and 3D print parameters, primarily the infill density.\n2. Explant dissection and dexamethasone pretreatment\nEuthanize mice via CO2 inhalation and secondary cervical dislocation, or according to institutional guidelines. This protocol utilizes C57BL/6 mice less than 1 year old. Hind limb size will increase with age and may become challenging to fit within the grips.\nPrior to dissection, transfer 70 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) culture media into a 100 mm (diameter) x 25 mm (height) Petri dish in a sterile biological safety cabinet (BSC). Add dexamethasone to achieve 100 nM working concentration.",
    "Dissections can be carried out on the benchtop using absorbent underpads, working swiftly through the dissection before transferring hind limb explants into the BSC. Assemble the surgical tools required for this dissection which include smooth, straight, fine tip forceps; straight, fine tip forceps with serrated teeth; and straight, sharp, fine scissors.\nFor dissection of hind limb explants, place the mouse in a supine position and identify the hip joint. Using fine scissors, make a small (5-10 mm) incision through the skin overlaying the proximal and anterior (cranial) aspect of the upper leg.\nPull the incision apart to expand, pinch the exposed upper leg using fingers, and carefully pull the skin distally to deglove the hind limb to the level of the ankle. Gently insert one scissor blade under the skin along the dorsal aspect of the foot and make an incision extending to the toes. Continue to pull the skin distally to completely remove.\nPosition the mouse to visualize the Achilles tendon insertion onto the posterior (caudal) aspect of the calcaneus, near the ankle. Proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion, the plantaris tendon lies directly adjacent to the medial border of the Achilles tendon and extends distally toward the plantar aspect of the foot, passing over the posterior aspect of the calcaneus.\nTo remove the plantaris tendon, carefully insert one tip of the smooth, fine tip forceps between the two tendons and extend the tip medially passing underneath the plantaris tendon. Draw the tip proximally and tear through the plantaris muscle. Using fine tip, serrated forceps, grab the detached proximal end of the plantaris tendon and pull distally to remove.",
    "At the hip joint, use fine scissors to cut through the pelvis and isolate the hind limb. Use the scissors to pry off the remaining pelvis and expose the femoral head.\nTransfer the hind limb explant to the BSC and into the dish containing cell culture media with dexamethasone. Move the dish into the incubator and pretreat for 48 h.\n3. Explant culture and loading platforms\nAs the 48 h pretreatment concludes, prewarm sufficient volumes of culture media (section 1). From this point forward, no dexamethasone will be added to culture media. At this time, limbs from the pretreated (day 0) group can be fixed, decalcified, and embedded in paraffin for future sectioning, staining and analysis.\nFor the unloaded group, aspirate pretreatment media and transfer explants to fresh Petri dishes, add 70 mL of culture media each, and return to the incubator.\nFor the baseline tension and static impingement groups, prepare explant platforms. Cut pieces of sandpaper similar in size to the grip platens. For the static impingement group, cut pieces of braided line approximately 18 inch in length and pre-tie a loose overhand knot halfway along the length of line. Tear pieces of aluminum foil to cover each acrylic bath and spray with 70% ethanol (EtOH). Transfer preparations to the BSC.\nEach platform includes an acrylic bath, base, volume reduction insert, clip, and grips. Each grip includes two platens and three different types of screws including one M5 x 0.8 mm thread x 10 mm long screw that attaches the grips to the base; two M6 x 1 mm thread x 20 mm long screws that extend the platens to clamp the grips; and four M3 x 0.5 mm thread x 14 mm long screws that, in combination with four compression springs, retract the platens to open the grips.",
    "Place all components into secondary containers capable of capturing all culture media in the event of a leak. Submerge in ≥ 10% bleach solution and soak for at least 1 h. Rinse off bleach solution with tap water (autoclave as needed) and move into the BSC.\n\tNOTE: For troubleshooting contamination, consider autoclaving all tap water or using purified water. See the Discussion for additional tips when addressing contamination.\nUse the M3 screws and compression springs to attach platens to the grips, secure the grips to the base using the M5 screw, and insert the M6 screws until they engage the platens. Use double-sided tape to attach sandpaper to the platens, then close the grips to promote adhesion of the sandpaper to the platens. Repeat for all platforms.\nWhen ready to load a platform, fully open the grips and using forceps, place the upper leg and knee between the platens with the superficial surface of the Achilles tendon facing upward (Figure 1A). Loosely close the grips to gently hold in place.\nUse forceps to grab the exposed femoral head or foot and manipulate the knee flexion angle as you gradually close the grips to secure in place. For the baseline tension group, extend the knee joint as described previously. As the grips tighten with the knee extended, the ankle should naturally extend. For the static impingement group, flex the knee joint between the grips as described previously.\nFor the static impingement group, place the overhand knot of the string around the distal paw and tighten. Route the string through a slot in the base located underneath the explant and through the clip hole. Place the base into the acrylic bath and secure the clip to the top edge of the bath (Figure 1A).",
    "Pull the string to dorsiflex the foot to at least 110° with respect to the tibia and use a permanent marker to mark the string as it exits the clip. Take a photograph of the explant in this position to later quantify dorsiflexion angle (Figure 1A).\nRemove the base and attach the volume reduction insert by sliding along a track on the base. Place the base (now attached to the volume reduction insert) back into the acrylic bath and reposition the clip on the top edge. Pull the string to return to the original dorsiflexion angle using the marked string as a guide and secure the string to the outside of the bath with tape to maintain static dorsiflexion.\nFor the baseline tension group, simply place the base with volume reduction insert into the acrylic bath once the explant is positioned between the grips and take a photograph for quantification of dorsiflexion angle.\nAdd 125 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) culture media to each platform to submerge explants. Cover the top of the bath with aluminum foil, place in a secondary container, and move into the incubator. Culture for 7 additional days, changing media every 48-72 h.\n\t​NOTE: Tape placed across the top of the bath can prevent PLA parts from floating.\n4. Fixation, decalcification and paraffin embedding\nFollowing explant culture, use scissors to trim toenails/distal toes and cut away the upper leg proximal to the Achilles myotendinous junction. Place each trimmed ankle joint into a processing cassette lined with foam biopsy pads. Push the ankle into the cassette corner to position the ankle at approximately 90° dorsiflexion and close the cassette to keep in place.",
    "Fix for 3 days in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) and decalcify for 2 weeks in 14% ethylenediamenetetraacetic acid (EDTA) dissolved in distilled water (diH2O) with pH adjusted to 7.4-7.6 with glacial acetic acid.\nTo remove salts, thoroughly rinse samples three times in both 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by diH2O, 5 minutes each. Perform routine sample processing for paraffin histology: dehydrate through a graded series of EtOH, clear in xylene, and infiltrate with paraffin wax. Orient and embed samples in paraffin to obtain sagittal tissue sections through the Achilles tendon in medial-to-lateral progression as described in section 5 below (Figure 1B).\n5. Tissue sectioning\nWith a microtome, carefully trim into the sample until sections are parallel to the block face. Grossly trim into the ankle from the medial aspect of the joint, stopping before reaching the medial border of the Achilles tendon insertion.\nTransfer the sample to an ice block to adjust temperature and hydration, and change blades (or shift to a fresh section of the current blade). Continue sectioning into the sample at 10 µm thickness and carefully identify entry into the Achilles tendon insertion with a brightfield microscope. Once identified, perform serial sectioning tracking section number (i.e., tissue depth) through the entire Achilles tendon insertion.\n6. Deparaffinization/rehydration and slide selection\nFor each assay below, select level-matched tissue sections from each pair of contralateral limbs. Prior to staining, place on a slide rack and move through 3 changes of xylene, 2 changes of 100% EtOH, 2 changes of 95% EtOH, and 1 change of 70% EtOH, 5 min each. Finish rehydrating in diH2O.\n7. TUNEL to assess Achilles tendon viability",
    "For TUNEL labeling, stain according to the manufacturer's protocol. Incubate in 20 µg/mL proteinase K for 20 min at room temperature and rinse in diH2O. Incubate in 50 µL of TUNEL stain solution (5 µL enzyme solution, 45 µL label solution) for 1 h at 37 °C. Rinse in diH2O. Mount with antifade reagent containing DAPI and coverslip.\nImage the Achilles tendon insertion using a fluorescence microscope with a 4x objective lens. Include a DAPI channel (excitation/emission wavelengths = 360/460 nm) to visualize all nuclei, a TUNEL (TMR Red) channel (excitation/emission wavelengths = 540/580 nm) to visualize apoptotic nuclei, and if possible, a brightfield channel.\nFor image analysis, import images into an image analysis software suitable for ROI-based processing, such as FIJI/ImageJ or MATLAB. Define a region of interest (ROI) outlining the entire Achilles tendon in view (Figure 2A), excluding cells in the epitenon that are highly susceptible to death induced by dissection and sudden change in environmental conditions when placed into culture.\nTo do this, perform ROI selection in MATLAB by importing the brightfield image and using the drawpolygon() function to trace and enclose the boundaries of the tendon. MATLAB creates a Polygon object for the ROI, which can then be applied to the DAPI and TUNEL channel images to mask out pixel intensity data outside the ROI using createMask() in order to only analyze nuclei within the Achilles tendon.\nImport the DAPI and TUNEL channel images and identify a fluorescence intensity threshold for defining apoptotic (TUNEL+) nuclei by normalizing to the maximum fluorescence intensity of apoptotic nuclei in nonviable tissues such as bone, muscle or fat that are incidentally captured in the tissue section. Once the images are masked, calculate the fraction of apoptotic nuclei (TUNEL+ nuclei/DAPI nuclei) within the Achilles tendon.",
    "8. Toluidine blue histology to characterize fibrocartilage formation\nOnce rehydrated (Section 6), transfer slide rack with level-matched tissue sections from contralateral pairs of explants to 0.4% w/v Toluidine blue O in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer with pH adjusted to 4.0 using glacial acetic acid. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature, then rinse 3x in diH2O for 30 s each.\nDehydrate through three changes of 95% EtOH and two changes of 100% EtOH, 30 s each. Clear through three changes of xylene, 1 min each. Coverslip with xylene-based mounting medium.\nObtain 24-bit Red-Blue-Green (RGB) color images of the Achilles tendon insertion. For example, for this protocol use an adapter to interface a digital color camera to the eyepiece of a simple brightfield microscope with a 4x objective.\nTo quantify differences in Toluidine blue staining within the compressive tendon fibrocartilage (CTF)16 at the Achilles tendon insertion (Figure 3A,B), import RGB images into an image analysis software capable of defining and managing multiple ROIs. Options include the selections and ROI manager tools in FIJI/ImageJ or the image processing toolbox in MATLAB. Begin by setting the pixel/length scale.\n\tNOTE: Software choice is left to the discretion of the researcher and is certainly not limited to MATLAB or FIJI/ImageJ. The authors have provided MATLAB code (Supplementary File 2), documentation describing implementation (Supplementary File 3), and a sample image (Supplementary File 4). We encourage researchers to translate this code to alternative programming languages for use in other software as needed or preferred.",
    "With the image displayed in the software of choice, identify the intersection of the deep tendon border with the calcaneus. From here, trace proximally 800 µm along the deep tendon border to establish the deep boundary of the CTF. For example, use the drawpolyline() function in MATLAB to interactively draw a polyline over the RGB image. MATLAB creates a Polyline object containing the vertices of the line, which can be processed and trimmed to a length of 800 µm.\nFrom this position, create the proximal boundary of the CTF by drawing a line segment connecting to the superficial tendon border that is perpendicular to the local fiber orientation.\nMove back to the intersection of the deep tendon border and the calcaneus and define the distal boundary of the CTF by drawing a line segment connecting to the superficial tendon border along the distinct tidemark separating the CTF from the attachment zone fibrocartilage (AZF)16 (Figure 3A,B). Lastly, generate the superficial boundary of the CTF by tracing the superficial tendon border to enclose.\nTo describe spatial variations in GAG staining across the insertion, divide the total CTF into 4 quadrants (Figure 3A,B). Connect the midpoint of the deep and superficial CTF boundaries with a line segment to create a distal/proximal boundary. Passing through the midpoint of this boundary, connect the midpoints of the distal and proximal CTF boundaries along the fiber orientation to create a superficial/deep boundary.\nThese 6 boundaries provide information that can be used to define the ROI representing the entire CTF, but also 4 quadrants subdividing the CTF. In MATLAB, for example, compile vertices defining the boundaries of each individual ROI (CTF, quadrants 1-4) into vectors and use images.roi.Polygon() to generate enclosed Polygon objects for each ROI.",
    "With ROIs defined, transform RGB pixel data into the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space using the color transformer plugin in FIJI, the rgb2hsv() function in MATLAB, or other software applying the appropriate transformation equations76. HSV data can then be projected into the 2D hue-saturation space, where each combination of hue and saturation encode a unique color (Figure 3C).\nWithin each ROI, calculate the average hue and saturation that describe the average stain color in the ROI. This can be achieved in MATLAB, for example, by using the Polygon objects defining each ROI to mask the image using createMask() in order to analyze hue-saturation pixel data specifically within each ROI.\nDefine another small ROI within the periosteal fibrocartilage (PF)16 (Figure 3A, B) and calculate average hue and saturation. Then, calculate the Euclidean distance separating the average color in each ROI of the CTF to that of the PF (Figure 3C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65801/65801eq01v2.jpg\n\tNOTE: The Euclidean distance calculation describes the degree of similarity between the average color of the ROI to that of the PF, a quintessential fibrocartilaginous tissue16,17,77. A smaller Euclidean distance indicates a ROI color that is more fibrocartilaginous in appearance.\nUse this distance to calculate fibrocartilage score, which assumes a maximum value of 1 if the ROI color is identical to the PF color and a minimum value of -1 if the ROI and PF color reach maximum separation within the hue-saturation color space.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65801/65801eq02.jpg\nAverage data for hue, saturation, and fibrocartilage score within each ROI across tissue sections from each limb. Perform paired statistical comparisons between groups of contralateral limbs.\n9. SHG imaging to investigate change in collagen network organization",
    "Perform SHG imaging of the Toluidine blue stained sections using a capable microscope system with a 20x object lens. Acquire z-stacks through the section thickness and perform tile scanning as needed to fully capture the Achilles tendon insertion.\nImport SHG images into a preferred image analysis software and define ROIs encompassing and subdividing the CTF at the Achilles tendon insertion as described for the Toluidine blue image analysis in section 8 (Figure 4A,B).\nIf SHG images are imported into MATLAB, use the approach for defining CTF ROIs in MATLAB as outlined in section 8 . After defining ROIs, transfer ROI coordinates into FIJI by exporting ROI vertices from MATLAB as .txt files and importing into FIJI using File > Import > XY Coordinates. Overlay the selection and send to the ROI manager for analysis.\nTo quantify collagen organization, use the Directionality plugin in FIJI, which performs Fourier spectrum analysis to calculate distributions of fiber orientations across small windows spanning a ROI. The spread of this distribution, referred to as dispersion, is inversely related to fiber alignment.\n\tNOTE: Collagen fibers may assume variable orientations in different windows across the CTF due to gross curvature of the tendon rather than the absence of alignment/organization. To better distinguish changes in collagen organization from gross curvature of the tendon at the insertion, it is necessary to define smaller ROIs.\nImport SHG images into FIJI and set the pixel/length scale. Project maximum pixel intensity data into a 2D composite image and add ROIs to the ROI Manager. Sequentially overlay each CTF ROI onto the image and draw 10 small sub-ROIs of consistent size within the ROI, adding the sub-ROIs to the ROI manager.",
    "Within each sub-ROI, run the directionality plugin in FIJI to calculate fiber dispersion. Average dispersion data across sub-ROIs within each CTF ROI, and average dispersion data within each CTF ROI across sections from each explant. Perform paired statistical comparisons between groups of contralateral limbs.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
