The Figure 4 provides a schematic representation of the steps in the protocol to be followed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231010/20231010202952_3032.jpgFigure 4. Protocol flowchart. Schematic representation of the steps in the protocol to be followed and the importance of the controls to be included at key times.As such, to avoid possible technical variances that may affect data interpretation, it is critical to properly set up the instrument with these following steps by adding technical and biological controls. To circumvent any issues, biological control samples and experimental samples must be processed and analyzed concurrently.Before each use, calibration of the flow cytometer has to be done by running CST beads provided by BD Biosciences.",
    "We strongly recommend performing titrations of each antibody, single staining controls, and fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls to obtain maximum resolution of cell populations and consistent results across experiments in these multicolor panels. Technical control samples such as FMO controls are essential to help define the boundaries between negative and positive populations. All of these controls allow adjusting the settings of flow cytometer voltages and automatically calculate a compensation matrix, which depends on spillover spreading. We recommend including (in addition of compensation beads) an unstained control by using the cells of interest in order to identify and correct for any intrinsic potential autofluorescence.In addition to these technical controls, we recommend adding biological controls for each experiment to control the intracellular staining and put the gates properly. As biological controls, we always include control mock mice, ex vivo unstimulated sample controls with and without Golgi Stop (Brefeldin, Monensin). These controls are crucial to validate the signals and to interpret correctly the data obtained by eliminating bias due to technical problems.Specific features The protocol we describe in detail here was used to define the functional profile of lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells during acute respiratory infection induced by a gammaherpesvirus and to understand the intercellular interactions controlling CD4+ T-cell activation. In order to characterize the phenotype of CD4+ cells and to study the mechanisms that control their level of activation and degranulation that take place in vivo, we established an ex vivo stimulation protocol, following which we used multicolor staining and multiparametric flow cytometry. Specifically, we isolated cells from the whole lung (without prior enrichment or sorting) and plated 2 million of cells per well in order to respect the existing in vivo stoichiometry and to preserve the intercellular interactions that participate in the local control of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells."
