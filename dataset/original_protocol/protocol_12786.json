    "1. Field Collection and Maintenance of V. Emeryi Colonies in the Laboratory\nNOTE: Nests of V. emeryi are found in rotting logs and fallen decaying tree branchesin secondary forests throughout Japan. This species shows two types of colonies, i.e., (1) colonies producing only long-winged queens and (2) colonies mainly producing short-winged queens in addition to small number of long-winged queens8,14. In this protocol, we collected the latter type of colonies in Ishikawa prefecture, Japan.\nCollect V. emeryi colonies during early summer.\n\tNOTE: To obtain sufficient numbers of sexual individuals during the reproductive season, colonies containing more than 300 individuals are preferred.\nTransfer the ant specimens from the collected branches to an artificial plaster nest with a glass cover using an aspirator (Figure 2, left).\nMaintain colonies in the artificial nest at 25 °C under a 16:8 h light/dark cycle. Provide tap water with a wash bottle to wet the plaster.\n\t\nAdd about 100 mg of dry cricket powder wrapped in aluminum foil and a brown sugar water-filled tip (20 µL tip) every other day until new reproductives (F1 winged-queens and F1 males) emerge.\n2. Experimental Laboratory Crosses\nNOTE: New reproductives start to emerge from late summer to autumn (Figure 3). Long-winged queens are produced sexually, and short-winged queens are produced clonally and have the maternal genome (Figure 1). Use long-winged queens and males for inbreeding crosses.\nTo stop individuals from moving, place colonies in a constant environment room at 4 °C for 15 min.\nRemove the mid-legs of 30 workers using forceps under a stereoscopic microscope and transfer them into new smaller plaster nest (Figure 2, right) for inbreeding crosses.\n\tNOTE: The legs are removed to distinguish the present workers from the workers that will be produced by the subsequent inbreeding crosses.",
    "Add 3-4 larvae or pupae into a plaster nest containing workers.\n\tNOTE: Workers show exploratory activity in the F0 queens-less colony. Larvae or pupae can effectively attract these workers and new reproductives in the center of the colony during crossing test. As a result, keep conditions of the experimental colony close to the normal colony.\nTransfer a long-winged queen and a male into a plaster nest prepared in step 2.3 for inbreeding crosses.\nKeep colonies at 25 °C under a 16:8 h light/dark cycle with food and water provided as described in 1.3 until the queen lose her wings and lay eggs.\n\tNOTE: This takes one week to a month.\nCheck the experimental colony everyday under a stereoscopic microscope. After performing inbreeding crosses between the F1 offspring, eggs can be observed under a stereoscopic microscope.\nAfter the F1 queen starts laying eggs, remove F1 males and larvae or pupae added in step 2.3 from the nest to avoid mixing of the F1 generation (males and females used for inbreeding crosses) and the F2 generation (offspring produced from inbreeding crosses).\n\tNOTE: If there are few males in the colony, it is possible to induce inbreeding crosses using one male and 1 to 3 queens in the same experimental colony.\nKeep colonies under the same conditionsas described in 1.3, until F2 offspring emerge.\n\tNOTE: Transfer F1 queen and F2 offspring into new larger plaster nest (Figure 2, left) for long-term colony keeping.\n3. Evaluation of Inbreeding Success\nDNA extraction and genotyping of the parental generation (F0)\n\t\nRemove one leg of a F0 queen using forceps and transfer the leg to a 1.5 mL microtube containing 100 µL of chelation agent.",
    "Under a stereoscopic microscope, dissect a female abdomen in glass dish filled with 300 µL of ultrapure water using forceps and isolate the spermatheca containing the sperm from mated males.\nPeel away the tissue of the spermatheca and isolate the sperm from the tissue of the female using insect pins.\n\t\tNOTE: To facilitate sperm extraction from the spermatheca, store female specimens in 100% EtOH for more than one day before dissection.\nUsing a micropipette, transfer the sperm into a 1.5 mL microtube containing 100 µL of chelation agent.\nIncubate samples of F0 queen and sperms prepared in step 3.1.1 and 3.1.3, respectively, at 95 °C for 20 min. Flash centrifuge the microtube and store at 4 °C.\nGenotype all samples using method described elsewhere4.\nDNA extraction from the pair of ants used for inbreeding crosses (F1)\n\t\nAfter confirming egg production by the sib mated F1 queen, extract the DNA of the queen using her shed wings or one mid-leg and genotype using same method described in section 3.1 above.\nExtract DNA of F1 male using one leg and genotype them using same method described in section 3.1 above.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples can be stored in 100% EtOH before DNA extraction, and DNA in chelation agent can be stored for two months at 4 °C.\nEvaluation of male fertility in males produced from inbreeding crosses\n\tNOTE: Diploid males produced from inbreeding crosses are often sterile.\n\t\nDissect internal reproductive organs in a glass dish with 400 µL of PBS solution using forceps.\nRemove PBS and add 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) using a micropipette.\nFix the tissue by incubating in PFA for 30 min at room temperature (15 - 25 °C).\nWash tissue 5 times with 400 µL of PBS using a micropipette.\nDilute the 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution to 1 µg/mL in PBS.",
    "Remove PBS and add approximately 300 µL of this dilute DAPI staining solution to tissue.\nIncubate 15 min under dark condition at room temperature (15 - 25 °C).\nWash tissue 5 times with 400 µL of PBS, and transfer tissue on center of slide glass using forceps.\nMount tissue on mounting medium containing Tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated phalloidin.\nObserve samples by confocal laser scanning microscope using 20X or 63X objective lenses.\nUse a 405 nm excitation laser and a hybrid detector at 410-530 nm for DAPI detection.\nUse a 561 nm excitation laser and a hybrid detector at 565-650 nm for TRITC detection.\nUse a scan speed of 400 Hz (400 lines/s) at a resolution at 1024 × 1024 pixels.\nCapture images using a software platform.\nSubscription Required.
