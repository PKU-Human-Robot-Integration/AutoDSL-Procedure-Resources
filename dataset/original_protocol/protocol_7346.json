    "ATP reconstitution Briefly centrifuge to collect the white powder at the bottom of the storage tube.Add 1 mL of cold 100 mM Tris base at pH 7.5 to reconstitute the ATP at 100 mM.Aliquot the ATP into experiment-sized amounts as needed.Snap frozen the ATP using liquid nitrogen.Store at or below -20 °C.Notes:  The lyophilized ATP (desiccated to <10% humidity) is stable for six months at 4 °C. The ATP is stable for six months if stored at or below -20 °C. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4553/bioprotoc-12-22-4553-g001.jpgFigure 1. Experimental instrumentation and timeline. (A) Daily timeline. (B) Workplace area and instrumentation. (C) Electronic Pipette+ OneLab, which reduces errors and assures consistency across many tests. (D) The protein solution is transferred to the cell cuvette and placed into the Zetasizer ULTRA holder to begin the diffusion coefficient measurements. (E) Subsequently, the dip cell (ZEN1002) is introduced into the Zetasizer ULTRA holder to perform ELS experiments and obtain the electrophoretic mobility, as well as the phase and frequency shift data plots.Protein reconstitution Notes:  Muscle actin is a liable protein; it should be handled with care. To avoid repeated thawing cycles, consider specific experimental sized amounts. Some of the steps considered in this section are recommended by the producer (Cytoskeleton, Inc). In addition to those, we considered the addition of mixing steps (B3 and B5), due to the rapid agglomeration/aggregation of the actin as the buffer is continuously added. Thus, we aim to achieve an aggregate-free solution by considering the following: as actin should be handled with care, the vortex speed is set at low to medium speed (4/10) for a short amount of time. Pipetting should also be carefully handled to avoid high mechanical stress in the protein solution.  This step is performed on Day 3 (Figure 1).",
    "The aliquots containing the protein and G-actin buffers are stable for six months at -80 °C. Transfer the protein powder into a 3 mL glass vial.Add 100 μL of ultra-pure water into the glass vial containing the protein powder to reconstitute at 10 mg/mL G-actin density.Vortex the solution for 30–40 s at low to medium speed (4/10) to dissolve the protein powder as much as possible.Add 2.4 mL of G-actin buffer (buffers 1, 2, or 3—Recipes section B) to the glass vial containing the protein solution.Vortex one more time for 35–45 s at low to medium speed (4/10) to dissolve the aggregates as much as possible. If aggregates are still present, pipette and mix the solution to achieve a homogeneous protein solution.Aliquot the solution into experimental sized amounts according to the number of experiments needed. Transfer the small-size solutions into cryotube vials. We recommend aliquoting the protein solutions into multiples of 250 μL (1×250 μL, 2×250 μL, 3×250 μL, …).Once the wanted protein solutions are aliquoted, snap-freeze the cryotube vials with liquid nitrogen and immediately store at -80 °C.Actin polymerization Notes:  ATP and DTT are initially stored at -20 °C. When ready to prepare the solutions, thaw both solutions. Immediately after use, snap-freeze them and store them back in the freezer. Following the manufacturer’s recommendation, after the 2 h centrifuge process, remove the top 90% (198 μL) of the supernatant from each microcentrifuge tube by following step C11. The amount of translucent pellet left in the microcentrifuge will be 22 μL. This step is performed on Day 4 (Figure 1).   A timeline for the actin polymerization steps can be seen in Figure 2.  Extract one of the cryotube vials containing 1×250 μL of protein solution from the -80 °C freezer.Wait 5 min for de-frosting at room temperature.",
    "Incubate the vial on ice for 1 h to depolymerize actin oligomers that form during storage.Extract 200 μL from the cryotube vial and transfer to a 1.5 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tube.Add 20 μL of polymerization buffer (1/10th volume) (buffers 1, 2, or 3—Recipes section C) to the microcentrifuge tube containing the 200 μL protein solution to start polymerization.Vortex the solution for 40–50 s at low speed (3–4/10).Incubate the protein solution at room temperature for 1 h.Turn on the centrifuge 10–15 min before the previous step is finalized. Set up the centrifuge at 50,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C.Note: The acceleration and deceleration should both be set at very low (2/10) speed. Centrifuge the protein solutions for 2 h.Carefully remove the tubes containing the actin protein solutions from the centrifuge and place them on ice.Set the 5–350 μL Pipette+ in titration mode at very low speed (1/10) and extract the supernatant from the solution in the following manner, to avoid any possible stress in the solution that could lead to the breakage of the actin filaments: 100 μL, 50 μL, and 48 μL.Using the same Pipette+ specifications as in the previous step, add 978 μL of electrolyte buffer (buffers 1, 2, or 3—Recipes section D) to the actin protein pellet (22 μL).Store the solution at 4 °C and leave it overnight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4553/bioprotoc-12-22-4553-g002.jpgFigure 2. Activation, nucleation, elongation, and annealing of actin filaments. (A) Hourly polymerization timeline of F-actin, starting with the incubation of actin protein at room temperature and the addition of the polymerization buffer. After one hour, the centrifugation process begins to separate the supernatant from the pellet (F-actins), and finally, the electrolyte buffer is added. (B) G-actin monomers undergo a polymerization process that starts with the activation.",
    "In this step, Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+ bind to G-actin monomers reducing its electrostatic repulsion between monomers and inducing a structural change. (C) Subsequently, the nucleation begins, where G-actin monomers form stable nucleus due to the presence of ATP- and ADP-actin, supporting the addition of more monomers. (D) During the elongation stage, monomers are rapidly added to the nucleus through both ends of the filament (pointed and barbed end). (E) Finally, in the annealing step there is an association and dissociation of G-actin monomers at both ends of the filament.UV-Vis spectrophotometer absorbance Notes:  Turn on the UV-Vis spectrophotometer 10–15 min before use.  Determine the protein concentration in the supernatant with the precision red protein assay reagent. The goal is to obtain the protein concentration in the pellet and after adding the electrolyte buffers. For more information, see the Data analysis > Protein Concentration Analysis.  Pipette 1 mL of precision red protein assay reagent into a 1.5 mL disposable microfuge tube.Add 10 μL of the supernatant protein solution obtained in step C11 and mix by inverting.Incubate at room temperature for 1 min.Transfer the solution into the quartz cuvette.Set the Scan Controls at 0.100 s for Ave Time, 0.12 nm for Data Interval, and 100 nm/min for Scan Rate.Blank the spectrophotometer on precision red protein assay reagent at 580–620 nm and read the absorbance of the protein sample at 600 nm.Dynamic light scattering A measurement consists of several averaged normalized intensity autocorrelation decays, called runs, each lasting 10 s. The number of runs can be determined automatically by the software, based on the scattered light intensity, which depends on the concentration and size of the macromolecule. Alternatively, it can be entered manually by the user. For F-actins, the number of runs is typically five (see more details under Data analysis).",
    "Instrument start-upTurn on the computer.Turn on the Zetasizer ULTRA by pressing the power switch located on the back of the instrument.The status light on the Zetasizer ULTRA will initially be red.Open the ZS Xplorer software.The status light on the Zetasizer ULTRA will become green shortly after.Wait 10–15 min for the instrument to stabilize.Standard operating procedure (SOP)Select Analyze > select Explorer > select Project Explorer ‘+’ sign > type the name of the new project.Select Measure (see Figure 3)Name: Type a sample name for this measurement.Cell: Select DTS0012 Material: Select Protein Dispersant: Select Water Project: Select the project created in step 2a.Measurement type: Select Size and 5 runs Measurement Temperature: Select 25 °CReturn to default temperature: Select Yes Equilibration time (s): Type 180 Data Processing Analysis Model: Select General Purpose Advanced Settings Angle of Detection: Select Back scatter Positioning Method: Automatically selected as Measure at a fixed position Cell Position: Automatically selected as 5.50 Attenuation: Select Automatic Measurement Process: Select Automatic Use pause after sub runs: Select No Optical Filter: Select No filter Pause between repeats (s): Type 0 Sample preparation for measuring translation diffusion coefficient and correlation functions:Remove the 1 mL aliquots of polymerized F-actins (buffers 1, 2, or 3—Recipes section B) from the 4 °C fridge and bring to room temperature for 10–15 min.In the meantime, clean and sterilize the scissors with water and ethanol. Cut Optifit tips up to a diameter of 3–5 mm from the tip. This action will greatly reduce the breakage of filaments when transferring the aliquot into a cell cuvette.The cell cuvette must be clean (air pressure) and free of scratches since this could lead to erroneous measurements.Set the Pipette+ (5–350 μL) in titration mode at low speed (1–2/10) to extract the protein solution into the cell cuvette.",
    "Titrate the protein at a 45° angle mode. The cell should be filled slowly at a 45° angle to avoid creating air bubbles.Do not fully cap the cell. Fully cap only one side of the cell. This action will also reduce the presence of air bubbles during measurements.Open the cell area lid by pressing the button in front of the lid. Push the cell cuvette into the cell holder until it stops. The small triangle at the top of the cell indicates the front of the cell, which should be facing towards the user. Close the cell area lid.During the measurements (every two sets of five runs), open the lid, remove the cell cuvette from the cell holder, and mix the protein solution 2–3 times using a cut tip of 3–5 mm in diameter. Immediately after, place the cell cuvette back in the cell holder and proceed to the next set of experiments. This action will minimize sedimentation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4553/bioprotoc-12-22-4553-g003.jpgFigure 3. Zetasizer ULTRA. (A) The DLS and ELS Zetasizer ULTRA instrument uses a 633 nm He-Ne laser. It houses a single cuvette and measures light scattered at 173°, 90°, and 17°. It is interfaced to a computer running Windows 10 and controlled with the Zetasizer software. (B) SOP window for ELS measurements. The settings shown here are also presented under the ELS SOP (step I1). (C) SOP window for DLS measurements. The settings shown here are also presented under DLS SOP (step H2).DLS measurementsWhen the project and specifications are set and the sample is loaded, begin the measurements. Click the Play bottom icon located by properties selection, and the initial green light of the Zetasizer ULTRA will turn blue.",
    "During DLS measurements, select Multi-view to display the following three windows: 1) “g2(t)-1” versus decay time “t,” which is updated as the run continues (see Figure 5); 2) the intensity fluctuations described in Background; and 3) the intensity distribution.As a series of runs accumulates into a measurement, select the Analyze tab and locate the Project Name to get all the data generated by this measurement.After each run is over, the distribution function is calculated, and many data options are available such as “Intensity vs. Size,” “Intensity vs. Volume,” and “Correlogram.” This process is repeated five times, obtaining five similar correlation functions.After the measurement is complete, the blue light will return to green, meaning that the Zetasizer ULTRA is ready for the next set of measurements.Electrophoresis light scattering A measurement consists of several averaged fast field reversal phase shift, called runs, each lasting 1.4 s. The number of runs can be determined automatically by the software, based on the scattered light intensity, which depends on the concentration and size of the macromolecule. Alternatively, it can be entered manually by the user. For F-actins, the number of runs is typically three (see more details under Data analysis).Standard operating procedure (SOP)Select Analyze > select Explorer > select Project Explorer ‘+’ sign > type the name of the new project.Select Measure (see Figure 3)Name: Type a sample name for this measurement.Cell: Select ZEN1002 Material: Select Protein Dispersant: Select Water Project: Select the project created in step 1a.",

After every measurement, the electrodes must be cleaned to reduce contamination across samples.The dip cell must be placed into the sample cuvette. Place the ZEN1002 cell into the cell cuvette containing the protein solution. Ensure that the small triangle at the top of the cell still faces the front of the instrument, as indicated in section I. Make sure that the sample does not overflow the cuvette when the ZEN1002 is fully inserted.Holding the base of the ZEN1002 cell cap and the top of the cuvette simultaneously, push the cell into the cell holder until it stops.Open the cell area lid by pressing the bottom in front of the lid. Simultaneously holding the base of the ZEN1002 cell cap and the top of the cuvette, push the cell into the cell holder until it stops. Close the cell area lid.During the ELS measurements, check the dip cell electrodes and sample for any potential contamination. Failing to clean the electrodes after each run could lead to cross-contamination between samples.",
