    "1. Cell pretreatment and metaphase preparation\nThe cells are grown in Dulbecco's Modification of Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10-15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2 incubator, until they reach 70-80% confluency.\nTreat the cells with colcemid solution at 0.05 μg/ml for 30-60 min.\nCollect the medium containing any floating cells in 50-ml sterile falcon centrifuge tubes. Rinse the cells on the plate with sterile1X-PBS. After incubating with sterile trypsin for 1-2 min, harvest and collect the remaining cells into the same tube.\nSpin the tubes at 1000 r.p.m. for 5 min, aspirate the supernatant leaving 0.5 ml and loosen pellet by flicking with finger only.\nDepending on the pellet size, add 5-10 ml of hypotonic solution of 0.56% KCl in dH2O and incubate the suspension at 37°C for 30-45 min.\nAdd one drop of methanol/acetic acid (3:1 vol/vol) per ml of hypotonic cell suspension and invert the tube gently for mixing.\nCentrifuge at 1200 r.p.m. for 5 min and collect pellet as step 1.4, then add 5 ml of fresh methanol/acetic acid (3:1 vol/vol) fixative solution dropwise while flicking the pellet continously. This procedure is critical so that the metaphase spreads will not be trapped in the cells' clumps which would compromise the experiment.\nCentrifuge again at 1200 r.p.m. for 5 min and add 5-10 ml of ice-cold methanol/acetic acid fixative along the wall of the tube. At this stage, if needed, the cells can be stored in fixative solution in a tightened and sealed tube at -20°C for short term or -80°C for long term (years) for future use.",
    "Clean slides in absolute ethanol, then dip the slide in dH2O for approximately10X in order to form a sheath of water on the surface of the slide. Place the slide on a glass plate and drop 15-20μl of cell suspension (from step 1.8) from 10\" above the slide. Place the slide in a water bath set at 65-70°C for 1-2 min and allow to dry.\nCheck the slide under a light microscope using 10X and 40X dry objectives making sure there is metaphase chromosomes and the spreads are evenly spaced. Check for cytoplasm presence surrounding the chromosomes. If cytoplasm is present proceed with slide pretreatment (pepsin digestion), if no cytoplasm is present and the chromosomes have good morphology, then there is no need for slide pretreatment.\n2. Slide pretreatment (pepsin treatment)\nApply 120 μl of 1:200 RNase solution (20 mg/ml) dissolved in 2X-SSC onto a 24 mm x 60 mm microscope coverglass and invert the metaphase slide face down on the coverglass then gently invert the metaphase slide face up and incubate at 37°C for 45 min.\nCarefully remove the coverglass without scratching the slide and wash in 2X-SSC buffer in a coplin jar every 5 min for 15 min with shaking.",
    "Add 5-15 μl of pepsin stock solution (100 mg/ml in dH2O) into a clean beaker and then add 100 ml of prewarmed (37°C) 0.01M HCl. It is important that the pepsin is added into a clean beaker first and not directly into the HCl solution, otherwise it wouldn't dissolve in solution. Incubate the slide in a coplin jar containing the HCl/pepsin solution at 37°C for 3-5 min. This step is very critical as too much digestion will cause the chromosomes to be overdigested and too little digestion will leave the cytoplasm undigested which might lead to non-specific binding of the probe and interfere with the hybridization signal.\nWash the slide in a coplin jar containing 100 ml 1X-PBS for 5 min twice at room temperature.\nWash the slide in a coplin jar containing 100 ml 1X-PBS/MgCl2 for 5 min at room temperature (50 ml of 1M MgCl2 in 950 ml of 1X-PBS).\nPlace the slide in a coplin jar containing 100 ml 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (1.7 ml of 37% formaldehyde in 100 ml of 1X-PBS/MgCl2).\nWash the slide in a coplin jar containing 100 ml 1X-PBS for 5 min.\nObserve the slide under a light microscope using 40X dry lens to ensure that the slides are digested properly and no cytoplasm is present and the chromosome morphology is preserved. Select an area for hybridization using a diamond pen.\n3. Chromosome and probe denaturation and hybridization\nPrepare fresh denaturing solution (70% formamide/2X SSC, pH 7.0) and prewarm to 70-80°C in a coplin jar placed in a water bath Place the slide in the coplin jar containing the denaturing solution in a water bath at 70°C for mouse chromosomes and 80°C for human chromosomes for 30s-1.5 min.",
    "Immediately place the slide in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 3 min followed by 80% and 100% ethanol for 3 min each and air dry. Examine the slide for chromosome morphology. Good chromosome morphology is denoted by dark chromosomes and not \"phase-light\" or halo chromosomes.\nWarm the SkyPaint probe (SKY paint kit; vial#1) at 37°C with shaking for 20 min, vortex and centrifuge briefly at 1000 r.p.m. for a few seconds.\nDenature the probe in a thermocycler programmed for a two-step cycle at 85°C for 5 min cycle followed by 37°C for 60 min to allow labeled-probe DNA for preannealing.\nApply 10μl of the denatured probe onto the area of hybridization and cover with a 22 mm x 40 mm coverglass making sure not to trap air bubbles. Seal the edges of the coverglass with rubber cement and incubate in a humidified chamber at 37°C for 48-72 hrs.\n4. Fluorescent probe detection\nRemove the coverglass carefully and place the slide in a coplin jar containing prewarmed (45°C) washing solution I (freshly prepared 50% formamide in 2X SSC). Wash for 5 min three times at 45°C in a shaking water bath at 45 r.p.m.\nWash the slide in washing solution II (1X SSC) at 45°C for 5 min twice with shaking.\nWash the slide in washing solution III (4X SSC/0.1% Tween 20) for 5 min at 45°C with shaking.\nApply 80 μl of blocking reagent (SKY paint kit; vial#2), place a coverslip and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nRemove the slide and allow the fluid to drain. Apply 80 μl of Cy5 staining reagent (Concentrated Antibody Detection CAD kit; vial#3), apply a coverglass and incubate at 37°C for 40 min.\nWash the slide with washing solution III at 45°C for 5 min three times with shaking.",
    "Apply 80 μl of Cy5.5 staining reagent (Concentrated Antibody Detection CAD kit; vial#4), place a coverglass and incubate at 37°C for 40 min.\nWash the slide with washing solution III at 45°C for 5 min three times with shaking.\nTilt the slide and allow the fluid to drain. Apply 20 μl of the anti-fade DAPI reagent (SKY paint kit; vial#5) and place a 24 mm x 60 mm microscope coverglass. Carefully remove air bubbles that might have formed. Slides can be imaged immediately or stored at 4°C in the dark for no longer than 1 week.\n5. Image acquisition and analysis\nImage acquisition is accomplished by viewing metaphase slides using an Olympus microscope equipped with a 60X oil immersion lens, a Spectral cube (custom designed triple band pass filter), a DAPI filter and a sagnac interferometer module with a CCD camera.\nSpectral-Karyotypes were carried out using SKY View software (Applied spectral imaging Version 1.62) following the user's manual.\nAfter analyzing the images, the chromosomes can be viewed as color images (with specific fluorescent colors), pseudo color images (with colors for classification) and inverted DAPI images (specific banding pattern).\n6. Representative Results",
    "A complete SKY procedure usually takes about one week time (Figure 1). This includes image acquisition and analysis provided that the metaphase cells are in adequate supply. Karyotyping analysis reveals normal mouse karyotype (40,XY) of cells from wild type mice (Figure 2a). In contrast, cells from Pkd1-/- mouse (PKD mouse model) shows a significant increase in chromosome number and structural abnormalities, such as chromosome deletions (Chromosome # 8) and translocations (chromosomes # 11 and 19) (Figure 2b). We also analyzed vascular tissues from the ADPKD patients. A simple study by counting the chromosomal numbers indicated that non-ADPKD and some ADPKD vascular samples had normal chromosomal numbers of 23 pairs (Figure 2c). In general, however, we observed failure of chromosomal segregation, resulting in 46 pairs of chromosomes in ADPKD samples instead of 23 pairs (Figure 2d).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3887/3887fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
