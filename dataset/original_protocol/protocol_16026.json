    "In this Basic Protocol, the procedures for the specific reverse transcription (RT) of microRNAs with a two-tailed primer are described. The user will dilute the previously extracted RNA samples to the required concentration and prepare a master mix containing all reagents needed for RT, including a microRNA-specific primer. Design guidelines for this are provided in the Strategic Planning section. Consider which primers and samples to use; if absolute numbers are desired, a standard curve (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0004]) of the target microRNA will be required. If editing isoform-specificity is important, a standard curve of the non-target microRNA should also be run in order to later calculate the relative detection of the non-target isoform. If editing frequencies of a microRNA (i.e., the proportion of a given microRNA pool that is edited) are to be calculated, assays for all editing isoforms will need to be run on the same sample in separate reactions. If the user is interested in relative expression of the microRNA, reference genes will need to be selected (see Strategic Planning) and run in parallel in separate reactions using the same biological sample. Multiplexing of two-tailed assays for different microRNAs in the RT step is possible in principle (Androvic et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0002]), but we recommend carefully testing this in each particular case. Reactions for different isoforms of one microRNA should be performed separately, since the sequences are too similar to multiplex the RT step.\nThe reaction mix and RNA samples will be combined in PCR strips and incubated according to the described reaction program (duration: 65 min) to obtain cDNA.",
    "The RT products should not be frozen and thawed before continuing with qPCR. We recommend that users keep the reactions at 4°C or on ice after completion and proceed to qPCR within hours. At most, the cDNA samples can be kept at 4°C overnight.\nMaterials\nRNA samples\nNuclease-free water (Invitrogen, cat. no. 10977-035 or equivalent)\nSynthetic RNA oligonucleotides standards (optional; for preparation of standard curves according to the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0004])\nqScript flex cDNA synthesis kit (QuantaBio, cat. no. 95049-100)\n1 µM two-tailed reverse transcription primer for each target and reference of interest (custom DNA oligonucleotide, e.g., from Invitrogen), see Strategic Planning and example in Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0002]\nIDTE pH 7.5, 1× TE Solution (Integrated DNA Technologies, cat. no. 11-05-01-15)\n1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (Sarstedt, cat. no. 72.690.001 or equivalent)\n0.2 ml PCR tubes, strips or individual (Sarstedt, cat. no. 72.991.102 or equivalent)\nPipettes and filter tips (nuclease/DNA/RNA-free)\nIce bucket\nVortexer\nBenchtop mini centrifuge\nThermocycler\n1. Thaw RNA samples and reagents on ice. The following steps should be performed on ice as well.\n2. Dilute all samples to the same desired concentration with nuclease-free water.\nDepending on the expression level of the microRNA of interest, and the sample type, different amounts of input RNA will be required. If RNA was isolated with a procedure that enriches small RNAs, 10 to 20 ng can be sufficient. If, instead, total RNA is used, 100 to 500 ng may be needed. We recommend that users run a pilot experiment testing different amounts of input for their sample type with a highly abundant sample that can be spared before running an entire batch of precious samples.\n3. (Optional) Prepare standard dilutions for each target microRNA (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0004]) that will be assayed.",
    "This step is only necessary if absolute numbers are needed. When only studying relative expression, there is no need for a standard curve. The Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0004] contains detailed instructions for the preparation of standards. It is crucial that the standard dilutions are prepared on the same day and not frozen and thawed before usage.\nWhen analyzing microRNA editing isoforms, we recommend running both a standard with the target isoform (e.g., edited microRNA) and the non-target isoform (e.g., unedited microRNA) for the assay of interest. This can be used to calculate the relative detection of the non-target isoform by the assay at the end of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0002] or the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0003] (Step 11).\n4. Using reagents from the qScript flex cDNA synthesis kit, prepare a RT reaction master mix by combining 5 µl water, 2 µl 5× reaction mix, 1 µl GSP enhancer, 0.5 µl two-tailed RT primer, and 0.5 µl RT enzyme per sample in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Vortex thoroughly.\nPrepare enough for all samples and standards, as well as a negative control. We recommend preparing an additional 10 to 20% excess of master mix to account for loss during pipetting steps.\nIf the RNA samples have a low concentration and a volume larger than 1 µl will be needed for RNA input, the volume of water used in the master mix may be reduced, or water can be left out entirely, allowing for up to 6 µl of sample to be used in step 6.\n5. Distribute the master mix into 0.2 ml PCR tubes, adding 9 µl of master mix to each tube.\n6. Add 1 µl of sample or standard to the prepared reaction mix. Include a “no template” negative control to which only IDTE or water is added.",
    "7. Mix the reaction mixtures by flicking the closed tubes. Spin down in a benchtop mini centrifuge.\n8. Place the RT reactions in a thermocycler and incubate for 1 hr at 25°C, then for 5 min at 85°C.\n9. Cool the samples at 4°C or place them on ice after the reaction has finished.\n10. Proceed immediately to either Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0002] for SYBR-Green-based qPCR, or to the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0003] for hydrolysis probe-based qPCR.",
    "This basic protocol describes qPCR of the microRNA target reverse-transcribed in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0001], using SYBR Green as a fluorescent marker. The cDNA products from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0001] are diluted and a reaction master mix is prepared. The diluted cDNA products and the master mix are combined in multiple replicates in 384-well plates and qPCR is performed. We recommend performing qPCR reactions for each RT product in triplicate. For microRNAs with extremely low abundance, quadruplicates are advisable, as the stochastic nature of the amplification process in early cycles will have a stronger impact in samples with few target molecules, resulting in a larger variability of the end result, the so-called Monte Carlo effect (Bustin & Nolan, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0008]; Karrer et al., 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0018]; Taylor et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0037]).

The following steps, until loading the qPCR plate, should be performed on ice.\n2. Dilute the cDNA 1/2 by adding 10 µl of nuclease-free water to each product. Mix by flicking the tubes and spin down in a benchtop mini centrifuge.\n3. Prepare a qPCR reaction master mix by combining 5 µl of PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix, 0.4 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 0.4 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, and 2.2 µl of nuclease-free water per replicate in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Vortex thoroughly.\nPrepare enough to perform three or four replicates of all samples, controls, and standards (if appropriate), and an additional no-template control. We also recommend preparing an additional 10 to 20% excess of master mix to account for loss during pipetting steps. If the user would like to perform the reactions in 96-well plates instead, double the volume of master mix should be prepared.\n4. Add 8 µl of reaction master mix to the wells of an optical PCR-grade 384-well plate.\nThe reaction can also be performed in 96-well plates. In this case, both the volume of the reaction mix and of the cDNA should be doubled, using 16 µl master mix in this step and 4 µl diluted cDNA in the next step.\n5. Add 2 µl of the diluted cDNA to the reaction mixes. Include a “no template” negative control to which water is added instead.\n6. Seal the plate with optical adhesive film and spin it down in a benchtop plate spinner.\n7.

This can help you ascertain that the fluorescent signal stems from specific amplification of the desired product. A single peak in the melt curve is indicative of the formation of only one product, but this should be confirmed with agarose gel electrophoresis (step 8).\n8. Run the qPCR products on a 3% agarose/TBE gel and look for a single band of the correct size (roughly 70 to 80 bp). Ensure that the negative controls show no band (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0003]).\nTo confirm that the amplification of the PCR product is specific, we recommend performing both a melt curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Due to the small size of the PCR product, a high percentage agarose gel should be used.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/033f4ff0-b26c-4567-82ca-b6e51ec2dcb0/cpz1645-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Example of an agarose gel to analyze the specificity of RT-qPCR products. Shown are the qPCR products from two different assays for hsa-miR-379 that were tested for their specificity with a no-template negative control and two different amounts of microRNA input (one below and one above the detection limit of approximately 100 molecules). The correct size of the product (80 bp) as well as bands produced by the primers used for RT-qPCR are marked with arrows. Assay 1 produces a specific product of the expected size with a high enough input, but when too little or no template is present, a slightly larger non-specific product is formed. Both products emit SYBR Green fluorescence, indicating that this assay is not suitable. In contrast, assay 2 produces a specific product with sufficient input target microRNA, but with input below the detection limit and in the negative control, no product is present. Assay 2 was used for further optimization experiments, whereas assay 1 was discarded as a candidate.\nData Analysis Option 1: Absolute Quantification Using a Standard Curve\n9. Construct a standard curve by plotting the Cq values observed for each concentration of synthetic RNA oligonucleotides against the log10 of the input concentration. Perform linear regression to obtain a standard curve.\n10. Using the slope of the standard curve, the PCR efficiency can be calculated using the following formula:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} \\textit{Efficiency}\\; (\\%) = {\\rm{\\ }} - 1 + {10}^{\\left( {\\frac{1}{{slope}}} \\right)} \\times {\\rm{\\ }}100 \\end{equation*}$$\nFor example, the standard curve for the assay for edited miR-379 has a slope of −3.69 (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0004]). This indicates a PCR efficiency of 87%:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} \\textit{Efficiency}\\; (\\%) = {\\rm{\\ }} - 1 + {10}^{\\left( {\\frac{1}{{ - 3.69}}} \\right)} \\times {\\rm{\\ }}100 = 87{\\rm{\\% }} \\end{equation*}$$",
    "The PCR efficiency should be in the range of 85 to 115%. If the standard curve in your experiment does not lend itself to linear regression, or the PCR efficiency is outside of the optimal range, please consult the troubleshooting section and Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-tbl-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/29be1b23-5f99-49fb-8d29-aac8ad393e53/cpz1645-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nExamples of standard curve analysis and interpolation of samples for obtaining absolute numbers. Standard curves for synthetic miR-379 molecules using an assay that is specific for edited miR-379 are shown. (A) When using the assay specific for edited miR-379, the Cq values for the non-target unedited miR-379 (teal empty circles) are much higher than for the same concentration of target edited miR-379 (pink filled circles). Comparing the Cq values of the target and non-target isoform allows for the calculation of the relative detection rate of non-target miR-379. Linear regression of the data points for edited miR-379 produces the pink standard curve, and its slope aids in the calculation of the PCR efficiency. (B) The interpolation of an unknown sample (black cross) is shown. Using the standard curve obtained by linear regression, the x value and, therefore, the sample concentration can be interpolated from the average Cq value of the sample replicates. The data in the figure were obtained by RT with edited miR-379-specific primers (sequences in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0002]) and SYBR Green-based qPCR as described in Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0002].

    "No amplification,Too little input RNA,\"Repeat the experiment with higher input. If the RNA concentration is limiting, use less water in the master mix for RT, or concentrate the RNA samples by ethanol precipitation, potentially using a carrier like glycogen if the total RNA amount is low.\"\n,Poor quality of RNA or reagents,\"Running the RNA sample on a denaturing agarose gel can identify RNA degradation, whereas spectrophotometry can identify the presence of contaminating chemicals that may inhibit the reaction.

Alternatively, design new primer sets with lower melting temperatures.\"\n11. (Optional) If working with editing isoform-specific assays, calculate the relative detection of the non-target isoform at each concentration. Use the following formula:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} Relative{\\rm{\\ }}detection\\ \\left( \\% \\right) = {2}^{{\\rm{\\ }}{C}_q\\left( {target{\\rm{\\ }}isoform} \\right){\\rm{\\ }} - Cq\\left( {non - target{\\rm{\\ }}isoform} \\right)} \\times {\\rm{\\ }}100 \\end{equation*}$$\nFor example, the Cq value for RT-qPCR of 109 molecules edited miR-379 with the assay for edited miR-379 was 15.271 (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0004]). The Cq value with the same number of molecules of unedited miR-379 using the assay for edited miR-379 was 27.942. This results in a relative detection of 0.015% at this concentration:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} Relative{\\rm{\\ }}detection\\ \\left( \\% \\right) = {2}^{\\left( {15.271{\\rm{\\ }} - 27.942} \\right)} \\times {\\rm{\\ }}100 = 0.015{\\rm{\\% }} \\end{equation*}$$",
    "12. Interpolate the absolute number of target microRNA molecules in each sample from the average Cq of the triplicates based on the linear regression in Step 9 (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0004]).\n13. (Optional) If separate reactions to quantify both the edited and the unedited microRNA isoform from the same sample were performed, the editing frequency of the microRNA can be calculated as:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} editing{\\rm{\\ }}frequency = \\frac{{number\\left( {edited{\\rm{\\ }}molecules} \\right)}}{{number\\left( {unedited{\\rm{\\ }}molecules} \\right) + number\\left( {edited{\\rm{\\ }}molecules} \\right)}} \\end{equation*}$$\nFor example, in prostate cancer cells overexpressing ADAR2 (Voss et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0039]), the enzyme responsible for miR-379 editing (Kawahara et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0020]), interpolation of the absolute numbers as described in Step 12 indicated that the sample contained 96,840 molecules of edited miR-379, and 158,171 molecules of unedited miR-379. This results in an editing frequency of 38%:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} editing{\\rm{\\ }}frequency = \\frac{{96840}}{{158171 + 96840}} = 0.38 = 38{\\rm{\\% }} \\end{equation*}$$\nThis was considerably higher than the editing frequency of a sample from control cells with 2222 molecules of edited miR-379, and 292,907 molecules of unedited miR-379, giving an editing frequency of 0.8%:\n         formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} editing{\\rm{\\ }}frequency = \\frac{{2222}}{{292907 + 2222}} = 0.008 = 0.8{\\rm{\\% }} \\end{equation*}$$\nCalculated editing frequencies that are smaller than the relative detection of edited microRNA by the assay for unedited microRNA (calculated in step 11) could be artifacts and may not indicate the actual presence of edited microRNA. Similarly, editing frequencies that are higher than the relative detection of the unedited microRNA by the assay for edited microRNA subtracted from 100% do not exclude that unedited microRNA is entirely absent from the mixture.\nData Analysis Option 2: Relative Expression Using Reference Genes",
    "14. If absolute numbers or editing frequencies are not needed, and the user only wishes to calculate the relative expression of a specific microRNA or its isoform, the ΔCq method can be used for relative quantification (Livak & Schmittgen, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0022]) with the help of one or multiple housekeeping small RNAs quantified in parallel. Several useful resources are available describing in detail how to perform such a normalization (Bookout, Cummins, Mangelsdorf, Pesola, & Kramer, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0006]; Livak & Schmittgen, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0022]; Taylor et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0037]).",
    "This protocol is an alternative to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0002] and describes qPCR of the microRNAs reverse-transcribed in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0001] using hydrolysis probes, instead of SYBR Green, to quantify amplification. Hydrolysis probes may be preferred by some users, as they can be combined with any fluorophore. Potentially, this can also be used to multiplex the quantification of several microRNAs in the same qPCR reaction, but users should test this for each application. The cDNA products from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0001] are diluted and a reaction master mix is prepared. The diluted cDNA products and the master mix are combined in multiple replicates in 384-well plates and qPCR is performed. The qPCR reactions for each RT product should be performed in triplicate. Quadruplicates may be more appropriate for microRNAs with extremely low abundance. The qPCR data will then be used to quantify the target microRNA(s) in absolute numbers and/or in relation to housekeeping genes.\nMaterials\ncDNA samples from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0001]\nNuclease-free water (Invitrogen, cat. no. 10977-035 or equivalent)\nPrimeTime gene expression master mix (Integrated DNA Technologies, cat. no. 1055772)\n10 µM forward and reverse qPCR primers for each target and reference of interest (custom DNA oligonucleotides e.g., from Invitrogen), see Strategic Planning and example in Figure 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0002]\n5 µM hydrolysis probe for each target and reference of interest (e.g., ZEN/Iowa Black FW double-quenched FAM hydrolysis probes; custom order from Integrated DNA Technologies), see Strategic Planning and example in Figure 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0002]\nAgarose\nTBE buffer (Appendix 2; Common Buffers, Media, and Stock Solutions; Current Protocols in Human Genetics, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-bib-0012])\nDNA loading dye (Thermo Scientific, cat. no.

Thaw the reagents on ice. The following steps, until loading the qPCR plate, should be performed on ice.\n2. Dilute the cDNA samples 1/2 by adding 10 µl nuclease-free water to each product. Mix by flicking the tubes and spin down in a benchtop mini centrifuge.\n3. Prepare a qPCR reaction master mix by combining 5 µl of PrimeTime Gene Expression Master Mix, 0.4 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 0.4 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 0.5 µl of 5 µM hydrolysis probe, and 1.7 µl of nuclease-free water per replicate in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Vortex thoroughly.\nPrepare enough to perform three or four replicates of all samples, controls, and standards, and an additional no-template control. We recommend preparing an additional 10 to 20% excess of master mix to account for loss during pipetting steps. If the user would like to perform the reactions in 96-well plates instead, double the volume of master mix should be prepared.\n4. Add 8 µl of the reaction master mix to the wells of an optical PCR-grade 384-well plate.\nThe reaction can also be performed in 96-well plates. In this case, both the volume of the reaction mix and of the cDNA should be doubled, using 16 µl master mix in this step and 4 µl diluted cDNA in the next step.",
    "5. Add 2 µl of the diluted cDNA to the appropriate wells containing the reaction mix. Include a “no template” negative control to which water is added instead.\n6.

Run the qPCR products on a 3% agarose/TBE gel and look for a single band of the correct size (roughly 70 to 80 bp). Ensure that the negative controls show no band (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0003]).\nDue to the small size of the PCR product, a high percentage agarose gel should be used.\n9. Detailed instructions and examples for data analysis using either absolute numbers or relative expression are given in Steps 9 to 14 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0002] and illustrated in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0004].",
    "Here, the user will dilute RNA oligonucleotide standards of the target microRNA to defined concentrations in TE buffer, generating a series of 10-fold dilutions. This will produce dilutions containing 1010, 109, 108, 107, 106, 105, 104, 103, 102, 101, and 100 molecules per µl (tubes 4 to 14 in Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0005]). These standard dilutions will then be run in parallel with the RNA samples of interest in Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0002] or the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0003]. The standard curve will aid in the absolute quantification of samples. The standard samples should be used on the same day they are prepared due to the low stability of pure RNA in solution.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c5f8b125-1566-42ea-8e7b-c82f86410bc7/cpz1645-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nPipetting scheme for the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0004].

Add 5 µl of the RNA oligonucleotide stock to tube 1.\n4. Mix thoroughly.",
    "It is important that the solution is mixed well before continuing. We recommend mixing by pipetting the entire solution up and down with a pipette set to a large volume.\n5. Using a filter tip, transfer 5 µl from tube 1 to tube 2.\nIt is crucial to use a new filter tip for each pipetting step. Otherwise, the dilutions will not be accurate.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 as indicated in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-fig-0005], until 5 µl from tube 13 has been added to tube 14. Mix this tube thoroughly as well.\n7. Keep the tubes on ice until ready for use. RNA standards should be used on the same day that they were prepared. The RNA concentrations are substantially diminished upon freezing and thawing.\n8. Proceed to Basic protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0001] and then either Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0002] or the Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.645#cpz1645-prot-0003].\n9.
