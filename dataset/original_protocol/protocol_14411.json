    "The method reported was utilised in a study that received ethical approval from the Bournemouth University Research Ethics Committee on the 9th February 2016 (Reference 10571).\n1. LSCI Set up\nConnect the moorFLPI LSCI rear panel to its three sockets (power supply, Universal Serial Bus (USB) and IEEE1394) for the system to function.\nAssemble the Desktop Support Arm using 4 screws with the moorFLPI LSCI turned upside down, and fixed to the support arm.\nRotate the mounting bracket for downward imaging when attached.\n\tNOTE: The LSCI has three controls: (1) zoom adjuster – with the imager set in a position, less magnification can be adjusted to maximum and minimum settings for small and larger fields of view respectively. To ensure repeatability, an indexing ring label is provided; (2) focus adjuster – this is dependent on the measurement distance and must be adjusted after image position has been set. To ensure repeatability, an indexing ring label is provided; and (3) a polarizer – a linear polarizing filter is available to minimize specular reflection from exposed organs – the rotating mount can be turned through 360°.\nInstall the software to control the camera. The software is divided into two modules providing a measurement and review function.\n2. Participant Preparation\nEnsure the assessment is performed in a temperature controlled room (22 ± 1 °C) and that the participants are seated for 10 minutes prior to testing to adapt to room temperature.\nAvoid a strong source of artificial light and the sunlight shining on the participant or the LSCI as ambient light could affect the moorFLPI near infrared laser source operating at 785 nm.",
    "NOTE: A simple test to confirm whether ambient light levels are acceptable is by opening the imaging setup window and obstructing the laser. If the image is almost completely black then no further steps are required; if there is still too much ambient light present, further action is required.\nEnsure the participants are relaxed throughout the assessment, with their feet flat on the ground, if seated, and avoid conversations.\nPlace 8 cm2 of adhesive opaque patch (AOP) (e.g., Leukotape) on the skin area to mask the blood flow. This is done to account for the drawback of LSCI in terms of high sensitivity to artifact movement, and signal backscatter will be used for measurement of microcirculatory blood flow.\n3. Microcirculation Image Measurement\nSelect 'Spatial Processing' for 25 frames per second capture at 152 x 113 pixels.\nChoose 'Live image measurement' and adjust the position of the imager 20 cm away from the participant followed by adjusting the zoom, focus and polarizer for minimal specular reflection. The image should appear quite 'flat' and featureless.\nSet an exposure time of 20 ms for high sensitivity to small changes and low flux.\nUse a display rate of 25 Hz and a time constant of 0.3 s to account for rapid blood flow changes, and to achieve optimum contrast through reducing the image noise.\nCreate two equal size (2 cm2) regions of interest (ROI), named ROI 1 and ROI 2. Align ROI 2 so it is within the 8 cm2 AOP. Take care so that ROIs are not interchanging but kept close within 2-4 cm to reduce the need for re-centering if any mechanical movement results in ROI 2 no longer being in the AO area.",
    "NOTE: Blood flow measurement will be less accurate in low and high intensity areas, so it is important to have an optimal gain setting. The gain value ranges between 0 - 200. An optimal gain setting value is achieved in range of 70 - 80.\nPerform flux measurements relative to a reference baseline. In the case of this methodology, introduce 'the rest' stage as a reference baseline. Therefore, express a 'fast' and 'slow' stage blood flow as a percentage change from a baseline, 'rest' stage.\nRecord blood flow measurement in video format and save for offline analysis using an image review module.\n4. Offline Analysis\nNOTE: The moorFLPI Image Review Software allows the opening of a video to perform analysis.\nCalculate the mean flux within ROIs following a series of recordings of mean blood flow. ROI 1 is the real measurement of skin blood flow and ROI 2 is the backscattered laser speckle skin signal from the AOP.\nCalculate the mean blood flow by subtracting ROI 2 from ROI 1 (skin blood flow).\n\tROI 1 - ROI 2 = Mean Blood Flow"
