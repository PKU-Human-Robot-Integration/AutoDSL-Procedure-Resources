    "The procedures presented below were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of China Medical University & Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan (CMUH107-REC3-027) and registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System (registration number NCT04356651). All patients had to provide their written informed consent before participating in this clinical trial. This experimental protocol illustrates a typical FSN manipulation for use in a laboratory or clinical setting.\n1. Recruitment of patients with degenerative knee OA\nUse the following inclusion criteria for the screening process: (1) aged over 50 years old, (2) diagnosed with knee OA based on radiographic findings (Kellgren and Lawrence Grading above 2); (3) with the clinical symptoms of knee pain, recruiting only the side with the most severe knee pain, with palpated MTrPs in the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles; and (4) a visual analog scale (VAS) score > 5 on the side with the most severe knee pain.\nUse the following exclusion criteria: (1) severe internal medical problems, recent injury, trauma, or pregnancy; (2) history of drug abuse (including excessive alcohol consumption); (3) skin infection, ulcers, or injury on the treated knee; (4) history of knee surgery or joint replacement; (5) diseases of the central nervous system or peripheral neuropathy; (6) cognitive dysfunction or unable to participate in the entire trial; and (7) symptoms modified by medication for knee OA in the past 3 months.\n2. Treatment groups\nRandomly assign every participant to the treatment group (FSN treatment) or the control group (TENS treatment).\n3. Implementation of the FSN manipulation (Figure 1)",
    "NOTE: Although FSN has its origins in traditional acupuncture, the actual procedure is very different. The procedure of FSN treatment is strictly standardized according to the procedures proposed by the developer of the technique. The main emphasis is on the identification of tightened muscles, the selection of the needle insertion points, the swaying movement, and the reperfusion approach.\nPretreatment preparation\n\t\nSelecting the appropriate treatment position\n\t\t\nAsk the participant to lie on their back with the examined knee straight and the pelvis in a neutral position.\n\t\t\tNOTE: FSN needles are thicker than acupuncture or dry needling needles, and the duration of FSN manipulation is much longer. Therefore, choosing the correct posture is more crucial for FSN manipulation than for acupuncture or dry needling; lying prone or on one's side are also appropriate for the treatment of posterior lower limb disorders.\nFind and confirm the insertion area.\n\t\tNOTE: FSN does not require the insertion of needles into acupuncture or Ashi points. In most cases, MTrPs are the cause of painful musculoskeletal problems and the main target of FSN therapy.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the insertion area is close to the MTrP for single and small MTrPs and near the extremities for large MTrPs or MTrPs clustered in an area.\nAs one of the major functional limitations of knee OA is dysfunction of the quadriceps, gastrocnemius, sartorius, and gracilis and semitendinosus muscles, be sure to examine the active and latent MTrPs of the muscles in the lower limb, and measure some of the pain and functional findings associated with the knee OA.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In this study, the quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and pes anserinus tendons were found to have a higher number of active MTrPs and were associated with a higher intensity of ongoing knee pain22.\nSterilization process",
    "Before the insertion of the FSN needle, sterilize both the surface of the insertion point and the practitioner's fingers.\nFSN needling method and manipulation\n\tNOTE: The operation is divided into two steps: the first step is to insert the FSN needle, and the second step is to handle the FSN needle (swaying movement).\n\t\nNeedle insertion\n\t\t\nGently remove the protective sheath of the FSN needle, fix the FSN needle in the fixation slot of an FSN-inserting device designed for FSN needle insertion, and pull the fixing groove back into the locked position (Figure 2A).\nHold the inserting device, push the device into the desired insertion area to create an indentation at ~15° to the skin, quickly pierce the subcutis, and press the control button with the index finger. Once the FSN needle has popped out and penetrated the skin layer, remove the FSN needle from the fixation slot with the other hand, and remove the needle insertion device (Figure 2B).\nFlatten the needle and carefully push it in until it is fully inserted. When pushing forward, slightly raise the needle tip to see if the skin bulge moves with the needle tip. At this stage, ensure that the hand that is pushing the needle remains relaxed and free of resistance and that the patient is not able to feel any movement under the skin, soreness, swelling, or numbness.\nOnce the soft casing pipe has been completely buried under the skin, withdraw the needle core handle by ~3 mm, and turn 90° to the left so that the bulge on the bed of the cannula enters the groove of the needle core handle (Figure 2C).",
    "Locate the insertion point of the FSN needle at the proximal one-third of the line from the superior border of the patella to the anterior superior iliac spine (Figure 2D). Insert the needle in the direction of the patella until it is completely submerged in the subcutaneous tissue.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To confirm that the needle is not extending into the dermis or muscle, the participants must confirm that they are completely pain-free throughout the insertion process. To minimize pain during needle insertion, the insertion point of the needling must also be away from the surface vessels, most of which are veins.\nSwaying movement\n\t\tNOTE: This is the key procedure of the FSN treatment.\n\t\t\nUsing the needle entry point, slightly remove the needle holder from the skin, and with the thumb as the fulcrum, keep the index, middle, and ring fingers in a straight line. Keep the middle finger and thumb face to face against the needle, and alternate the index and ring fingers back and forth in a smooth, soft, fan-like swaying movement.The angle of the sector is approximately 60°; perform a total of 45 round trips in 30 s (Figure 3A).\n\t\t\tNOTE: With a soft and rhythmic operation, the patient will not experience any soreness, numbness, or pain. One round trip constitutes a side-to-side swaying movement of the needle in the horizontal plane.\nReperfusion approach technique\n\tNOTE: The movement of the relevant muscle or joint is known as the reperfusion approach technique.",
    "Along with the swaying movement, ask the participant to move the relevant muscles or joints by themselves. For example, as done in this study, ask the participant to perform three cycles for a total of 1 min of a dorsiflexion movement with the sole of the foot (Figure 3B, C), with each cycle consisting of 10 s of continuous movement and 10 s of rest.\nAsk the participants to perform three cycles of sitting down and flexing and extending their knee joints for a total of 1 min (Figure 3D, E), with each cycle consisting of 10 s of continuous movement and 10 s of rest. Ensure that the range of motion in the knee extension/flexion and ankle dorsiflexion is as large as possible under safe conditions and is preferably slow.\nNeedle withdrawal\n\t\nAfter the swaying movement and reperfusion approach are completed, remove the FSN needle, and apply a dry cotton ball with adhesive tape to the needle hole to avoid bleeding.\n4. Implementation of the TENS manipulation\nNOTE: TENS is a non-invasive physiotherapy modality that is commonly used to treat acute and chronic pain caused by a variety of conditions. The procedure for TENS treatment emphasizes the patch position selection, current direction selection, and current frequency adjustment.\nPretreatment preparation\n\tNOTE: TENS is used to help reduce pain and muscle spasms clinically. The device comes with several sets of electrode wires and end pads. The TENS machine runs on batteries.\n\t\nPlace the small electrode connected to the TENS machine on the skin. The machine sends gentle electrical impulses to the electrodes.\nPositioning the pads",
    "Switch off the TENS device before attaching the pads to the participant's skin. Place electrodes at the Liangqiu (ST34) and Yanglingquan (GB34) points on the lateral knee and at the Xuehai (SP10) and Yinlingquan (SP9) points on the medial knee (Figure 4).\nCurrent direction and frequency adjustment\n\t\nTurn on the TENS machine after the pads are attached in the correct places. Let the current pass through each patch and across the knee joint, and select a continuous wave (ADJ waveform) with a pulse frequency of 110 Hz and a continual stimulation of 20 min.\nSwitch the TENS machine off after using it, and peel off the electrode pads from the participant's skin.\n5. Post-intervention and follow-up outcome assessments\nNOTE: The entire experiment course lasted 2 weeks. In this trial, a total of three treatment sessions were administered in the first week, with assessments before and immediately after each session, and follow-up visits were conducted in the subsequent weeks 1 and 2. Outcome measurements, which included the pain qualities, the muscle and tendon qualities, and the functional index questionnaire assessment were used.\nPain qualities\n\t\nAssess the patient's subjective pain intensity by asking the patient to fill out a VAS to rate the pain intensity around their knee before and after every treatment.\nUse a physical ability detection system containing a high-speed 3D accelerometer and gyroscope to capture walking speed databefore and after every treatment.\n\t\t\nPlace the measurement tool in the area below the shoulder blades, and use a special strap with a comfortable three-button fastening that naturally combines ground measurement information with trunk kinematics to provide accurate information about the stability and coordination of the upper body.\nAllow the patient to walk in a straight line on a horizontal plane for 30 s.",
    "Record the participant's projected travel speed via a computer connection.\nUse a goniometer to measure the progress in the range-of-motion (ROM), including the active ROM (AROM) and passive ROM (PROM), of the treated knee.\n\t\t\nPerform knee flexion ROM with the patient in the supine position lying on their back on a hard surface.\nAlign the goniometer against the participant's leg, ensuring that the circular disc at the center of the goniometer is against the side of the treated knee. Place the fixed arm of the goniometer along the lateral thigh so that it is in line with the end of the greater trochanter or femur attached to the bone at the hip, and place the moving arm of the goniometer along the fibula to the lateral malleolus. Have the clinician grasp the anterior part of the patient's lower leg with one hand, just proximal to the ankle bone, and the anterior part of the patient's thigh with the other hand, just above the greater trochanter major.\nBend the patient's hip to approximately 90°, and hold it in place with one hand while bending the knee with the other hand; slide the foot up close to the hip. Keep going until the treated knee reaches the maximum point of knee flexion ability. This is how much the knee can bend and straighten on its own, meaning that the knee muscles contract actively without any external help; this is also known as the AROM.\nApply a slight overpressure to determine how far the knee can be flexed and straightened when moved by an external force, commonly another person; this is called the PROM.\nMuscle and tendon qualities",
    "NOTE: The pressure pain threshold (PPT) is used to measure deep muscular tissue sensitivity, which is a quality of the muscles and tendons. We use an algometer to measure the PPT values of the quadriceps muscle, pes anserinus, and gastrocnemius muscle. According to previous research, the test-retest reliability of the PPT is excellent23.\n\t\nPPT measurements\n\t\t\nWhen measuring the PPT of the quadriceps muscle, instruct the participant to lie flat on the physiotherapy couch and maintain a straight-knee position with the skin of the quadriceps muscle exposed. Use an assistant's help or a small, soft cushion to adjust the direction of the center of the knee to face upward.\nWhen measuring the PPT of the pes anserinus, place the participant in the supine position on the physiotherapy couch, with the knee flexed 5-10° and the skin of the pes anserinus exposed.\nWhen measuring the PPT of the gastrocnemius muscle, instruct the participant to lie in the prone position with their legs extended, their feet over the end of the physiotherapy couch, and the skin of the gastrocnemius muscle exposed.\nFind the MTrPs or tender points, and mark them on the skin. The MTrP of the quadriceps muscle is located on the rectus femoris muscle and above the patella.\n\t\tNOTE: The tender point of the pes anserinus measured in this study was located approximately 6 cm distal to the knee joint line along the anteromedial tibial shaft. The MTrP of the gastrocnemius muscle we found and selected for our measurement was in the medial head of the gastrocnemius below the crease of the knee.\nApply a variable pressure of 0.5-1 N/cm2 in the vertical direction relative to the MTrPs on the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles and the tender point of the pes anserinus, slowly increasing the force applied.",
    "The threshold for a latent MTrP is indicated when the patient starts to feel pain or discomfort, and the threshold for an active MTrP is indicated when the pain intensity continues to increase to the point of intolerability. When the participant feels that the pain is intolerable and says \"stop\", record the data on the stress pain meter, and ask the participant to remember the level of pain or discomfort before proceeding to the next test. Reset the device to zero before the next test. Ensure that the examiner does not see the score displayed when the pressure is applied; test the point three times.\nProvide a 60 s rest interval between trials. The mean of the values after three measurements is defined as the PPT of the quadriceps muscle, the pes anserinus, and the gastrocnemius muscle.\nFunctional index questionnaire assessment\n\t\nAdminister the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) test using the standardized questionnaire.\n\t\tNOTE: The WOMAC was developed in 1982 at Western Ontario and McMaster Universities24. In the WOMAC, the participants are asked to complete a standardized questionnaire. The self-administered questionnaire consists of 24 items divided into three subscales that measure three separate dimensions, including pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), and function (17 questions). These items are scored from 0 to 4, which correspond to none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and extreme (4), and the maximum score is 96. Higher WOMAC scores indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.\nDetermine the Lequesne index by using the standardized test and asking the participants to complete the standardized questionnaire.",
    "​NOTE: The Lequesne index is divided into three main components for self-assessment related to daily routines. The first is a pain and discomfort score ranging from 1 to 8; higher scores indicate more painful clinical symptoms. The second component is the walking distance score, which ranges from 1 to 8; higher scores indicate greater difficulty in walking. The third component is the daily joint mobility score, which ranges from 0 to 8. The total score ranges from 1 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe clinical symptoms, such as more severe degeneration and inflammation of the joint.\n6. Statistics\nPresent the data as mean ± standard deviation. Analyze the baseline characteristics of age, sex, height, weight, VAS, WOMAC, Lequesne index, PPT, ROM, and walking speed using a Student's t-test. The continuous variables are the VAS, PPT, walking speed, ROM, WOMAC, and Lequesne Index scores. Set the significance level at p < 0.05.\nThe immediate effect is the variable change occurring immediately after each treatment. Identify the 1 week effect by comparing the variables at 1 week after treatment with their values before the first treatment. Determine the 2 week effect by comparing the variables at 2 weeks after treatment with their values before the first treatment.\nPerform a comparison between the groups before and after intervention using an independent samples t-test."
