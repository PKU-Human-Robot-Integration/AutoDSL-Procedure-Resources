    "Preparation of acute hippocampal slices from mouseOn the day of the experiment, prepare the ACSF (1 L) early in the morning. Place two beakers on ice and subsequently pour ~150 ml and ~20 ml of ACSF respectively in each beaker. Oxygenate (95% O2, 5% CO2) the solutions for all the duration of slicing procedure.Fill the recovery slice chamber with ~100 ml of ACSF at room temperature and oxygenate.Under the chemical hood, anesthetize the mouse. Check for the absence of reflex by pinching the paw. Quickly decapitate the mouse with large scissors. Expose the skull and, using a small scissor, open the skull along the midline from the cerebellum to the olfactory bulbs. This procedure should be quick and care should be taken while cutting in order to not damage the brain.Remove the brain with a spatula and place it in the small beaker, allowing it to recover for 10 min at 0 °C in ice-cold oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) ACSF. Prepare the vibratome by placing ice and water to surround the slicing chamber. Cut a razor blade in half and place one half in the blade holder of the vibratome (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190416/20190416014601_1372.jpgFigure 1. Blade setup into the blade holder. A. Using a screw, open the blade holder laterally. B. Carefully, place the half-blade into the open holder and block it.With the blade, remove the cerebellum and divide the hemispheres.Rapidly, put one drop of super glue on the plate of the slice chamber and locate the hemispheres with the ventral part side up. Pour the ice-cold ACFS in the slice chamber and oxygenate.",
    "The vibratome allows to set both the blade vibration frequency, from 0 (corresponding to 0 Hz) to 10 (corresponding to 55 Hz), and the cutting-speed, from 0 (slowest speed corresponding to 0 mm/min) to 10 (highest speed corresponding to 68 mm/min). Start slicing setting the cutting-speed at 3 and the vibration frequency at 10 to obtain 250 µm horizontal hippocampal slices. Transfer them in the recovery chamber using a Pasteur pipette (with the tip previously cut; Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190416/20190416014624_5614.jpgFigure 2. Modified Pasteur pipette. A. Using big scissors, make a transverse cut removing the tip of a plastic Pasteur pipette. B. Plastic Pasteur pipette after the tip got removed.Before starting experiments, allow the slices to recover for at least 2 h in oxygenated ACSF at room temperature (Figure 3).Note: Slices can recover both at room (~ 25 °C) and warmer temperature (30-37 °C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190416/20190416014647_5792.jpgFigure 3. Main steps for obtaining acute brain slices. A. After decapitation, expose the skull and cut from the caudal towards the rostral side of the brain. B. Using a spatula remove the brain. C. Place the brain in ice-cold ACSF and oxygenate. D. Prepare the vibratome surrounding the slice chamber with ice and water. E. Fix the hemispheres, with the ventral part side up, on the plate of the slice chamber, pour the ice-cold ACSF and start slicing. F. Allow the slices to recover at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF.  Imaging acquisitionPlace the slice in the recording chamber under the microscope. Check that the oxygenated ACSF solution is continuously exchanged through the perfusion/suction system. Set the ACSF perfusion at 1.5-2 ml/min.Use the 3.2x magnification (or a 4x or 10x magnification) to identify the hippocampal regions by bright field observation.",
    "Change magnification to 40x and identify the stratum radiatum (between the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region) by bright field observation.Select the filter for the excitation of GFP at 488 nm and visualize microglia. Excitation light sources can be a monochromator equipped with a xenon lamp or a led launched through a laser launcher box.Note: Imaging experiments should be performed in a dark environment. Choose a fluorescent field with a good signal-to-background ratio and avoid superficial fields (estimate depth from the surface 30-40 µm).Monitor microglial processes movement by acquiring a fluorescent image every 10 s for 25 min, setting light time exposure at 50-100 ms with a camera binning of 2 (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
