    "Measurement of flow-dependent changes in ciliary shape Mouse E7.5 embryos harboring an NDE4-hsp-5HT6-mNeonGreen-2A-tdKatushka2 (Katoh et al., 2023) transgene were isolated and roller-cultured as previously described (Behringer et al., 2014).We prepared the medium for observation (see Recipes) by supplementing FluoroBrite DMEM with 75% rat serum. The medium was incubated in a CO2 incubator.The distal portion of each embryo, including the node, was excised and placed into a chamber, consisting of a glass slide fitted with a thick silicone rubber spacer (thickness of 400 μm) to prevent disturbance of nodal flow, and covered with a coverslip (Figure 2). Setting the node region close to the glass surface is very important; however, do not deform the shape of the node to prevent disturbance of nodal flow.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4715/bioprotoc-13-14-4715-g002.jpgFigure 2. Schematic of the mounting of the mouse embryonic node. (A) For imaging, the distal portion of the embryo, including the node, was carefully cut. It is preferable to cut the tissue such that the node is located at the center top of the excised tissue. For immunostaining, the ectoplacental cone was removed (see section D). (B) A silicon rubber spacer was fitted on the glass slide. Excised tissue including the node was then placed in the center of the hole with the medium. The wide bore tip is preferable for usage (see Materials and Reagents). Lastly, it was covered with a coverslip.We perform 3D live imaging using the microscope described above (see Table 1).Setting of the objective: The correction ring was set at 0.17 μm for 37 °C. A lens heater (37 °C) was used. Note that the deconvolution calculation (see Data analysis) is sensitive to aberrations.Setting z-Piezo: the z-stack distance was set to 200 nm. Typically, 301 z-stacks (60 μm) were used.",
    "Setting of the EM-CCD camera: EMGain and A/D were 999 and 10 MHz, respectively.Note: When using a high level of EM gain, do not irradiate strong light to the EM-CCD camera to prevent damage to the image sensor. Table 1. Equipment settings for 3D live imaging table:",

The irradiation duration was controlled by a shutter equipped with an IX83 microscope using iQ software. Laser protection goggles must be worn during this operation.The procedure for 3D live imaging was repeated. The settings were identical to those of the previous imaging. In most embryos, the fluorescence intensity is weak; thus, the laser power for CSU is typically higher than before UV irradiation.The obtained 3D images were used for analysis for flow dependent change in angle of cilia and computational mesh generation for calculating membrane tension of cilia, as described below.Measurement of PSF for deconvolution calculation (see Table 2).Sample: fluorescent beads were diluted 1:1,250,000 in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS(-)] solution. The beads were attached to the glass surface within several minutes.3D imaging of a fluorescent bead was performed using the same settings as described in step 4, excluding the use of the EM-CCD camera. To increase S/N, the EM gain and A/D of the EM-CCD camera were set to 3 and 1 MHz, respectively.Table 2.

    "Manipulation of single cilium by optical tweezers Mouse E7.5 embryos harboring NDE4-hsp-dsVenus-Dand5-3′-UTR (Minegishi et al., 2021) and  NDE4-hsp-5HT6-GCaMP6-2A-5HT6-mCherry  (Mizuno et al., 2020) were isolated and roller-cultured as previously described (Behringer et al., 2014).The medium was prepared as described above.The beads were prepared for trapping. Twenty microliters of polystyrene beads (diameter, 3.5 μm) were added to 980 μL of FluoroBrite DMEM (1:50 dilution). After centrifugation at 20,300× g for 15 min, isolated beads (pellets) were resuspended in 200 μL of FluoroBrite DMEM.A distal portion of each embryo, including the node, was excised and placed into a chamber consisting of a glass slide fitted with a thick silicone rubber spacer (thickness of 400 μm) to prevent any disturbance of nodal flow (see Figure 2). The embryo was carefully trimmed to obtain a node located parallel to the glass surface to prevent deformation of the embryo during observation.A portion of the diluted beads was carefully transferred to the medium above the node with a P2 pipette tip to expose the node to ~1–10 beads, and then carefully covered with a coverslip.Live imaging was performed, and the target cilium was set using the ciliary GCaMP6/mCherry signal. A brightfield image was observed through a red channel of the CSU to check the shape of the embryo.In the case of analysis by whole-cell FRAP later, 3D images of ciliary mCherry and cytoplasmic dsVenus were recorded (typically a z-axis depth of 1 μm with 30 sections).Mechanical stimuli were applied to cilia using the microscope described above. A polystyrene bead was trapped, placed in contact with a cilium, and forced to oscillate along the dorsoventral (D-V) axis for 1.5 h with the use of optical tweezers. Laser protection goggles must be worn during this operation.Setting of the objective: the correction ring was set at 0.",
    "17 μm for 37 °C. A lens heater (37 °C) was used. Please note that optical tweezers are sensitive to aberrations.The setting of the IR laser was 400 mW for ZT1064rdc-sp-UF3 and 800 mW for ZT1064rdc-sp (condition in Katoh et al., 2023).Setting z-Piezo and USB-DAQ: a 2 Hz triangle wave with 1.025 ± 0.175 V amplitude was generated using USB-DAQ controlled by the simulate signal express function in LabView and applied to the z-Piezo (Figure 3).Note that we manually tracked the cilium using a motorized XY stage because most embryos were displaced or deformed during 1.5 h of stimulation.To measure mRNA degradation triggered by mechanical stimuli, we performed whole-cell fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, as described below.Measurement of trapping stiffness:Sample: polystyrene beads (diameter 3.5 μm) were diluted with distilled deionized water (MQ, typically 1:1,000) and placed into a flow chamber (Katoh et al., 2021) made up of a slide glass (24 mm × 60 mm, No. 1S), a coverslip (24 mm × 24 mm, No. 1S HT), and two pieces of double-sided tape for spacers (cut approximately 5 mm wide and 40 mm in length).Measurement: a single bead was weakly trapped by optical tweezers (typically 3.81 mW: laser power set at 100 mW and a 3.81% ND filter inserted into the optical pathway), and the restricted Brownian motion was measured. Motion of the bead was observed using a brightfield image with a CSU (using the bypath mode). Here, the frame rate needs to be faster than the cut-off frequency of the motion (we typically set this to ~200 fps).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4715/bioprotoc-13-14-4715-g003.jpgFigure 3. Setting of simulate signal express function in LabView.  z-Piezo applied a 2 Hz triangle wave with an amplitude of 1.025 ± 0.175 V using USB-DAQ.",
    "Measurement of Dand5 mRNA degradation by whole-cell FRAP Whole-cell FRAP is a method for measuring mRNA levels using the level of fluorescence recovery after whole-cell bleaching (Katoh et al., 2023). Before bleaching, 3D images of ciliary mCherry and cytoplasmic dsVenus were recorded (typically, a z-axis depth of 1 μm and 30 sections; Table 3).Table 3. Setting of 3D live imaging for whole-cell FRAP table:",

    "All cells in the node region were uniformly bleached by 3 min irradiation with a 488 nm laser (output power set at 55 mW). The irradiation duration was controlled by a shutter equipped with an IX83 microscope using iQ software (Figure 4A). Laser protection goggles must be worn during this operation.Fluorescence recovery was measured by 3D images using the microscope described above (Figure 4B).Setting z-Piezo: the distance of the z-stack was set to 1 μm. Typically, 30 z-stacks (29 μm) were observed.Setting of the camera: the fluorescence intensity was quite low compared with that before bleaching. Therefore, we usually employed a 2 × 2 binning mode with a 1 s exposure.3D images were captured 15 times at 2 min time intervals (total observation duration is 30 min).Bleaching was repeated and fluorescence recovery was observed during the repeated process for 30 min (Figure 4A).The intensity in the second fluorescence recovery is low; thus, finally, we observed the 3D image with strong excitation (typically 30–55 mW) and long exposure times (1–4 s in each z-stack).Analysis of fluorescence recovery is described below (see “Analysis of Dand5 mRNA levels for whole-cell FRAP experiments”).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4715/bioprotoc-13-14-4715-g004.jpgFigure 4. Setting of iQ. (A) Screenshot of Protocol in iQ. Steps 2–4 are automatically performed using this protocol. (B) Screenshot of Channel in iQ, representing the acquisition setting in Step 3.Measurement of Pkd2 distribution by 3D-STED imaging Immunostaining was performed as follows:Dissection: mouse E7.5 embryos harboring NDE2-hsp-Pkd2-Venus (Yoshiba et al., 2012) were recovered in cold PBS(-). The ectoplacental cone was then removed from the embryo (see Figure 2A). For this procedure, we recommend using a 1.5 mL tube (although other sizes work equally well).Fixation: embryos were immediately transferred to ice-cold PBS(-).",
    "When all embryos had been isolated, they were immediately fixed for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde.Rinse: embryos were washed three times with PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100 (PBST; see Recipes).Permeabilization: 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100.Rinse: embryos were washed three times with PBST.Primary antibody: incubated overnight at 4 °C with acetylated tubulin (1:200 dilution) and green fluorescent protein (1:200 dilution) antibodies diluted in PBST.Rinse and wash: antibodies were washed three times with PBST. During this, it is preferable to change the tube. Then, wash > 6 times with PBST at 1 h intervals.Secondary antibody was incubated overnight at 4 °C with STAR RED (1:200 dilution, anti-mouse) and STAR ORANGE (1:200 dilution, anti-chick) antibodies diluted in PBST.Mounting was performed as follows:Mounting solution: TDE-DABCO (see Recipes)A distal portion of each embryo, including the node, was excised and the node region was placed in PBST containing 10% TDE-DABCO. In the final step, the node should be located close to the glass surface, as described below, to prevent resolution reduction—so, carefully trim the embryo.The node region was transferred to PBST containing 20% TDE-DABCO.The node region was transferred to PBST containing 50% TDE-DABCO.The node region was transferred to TDE-DABCO.The node region was placed into a chamber consisting of a glass slide fitted with a thin silicone rubber spacer (thickness 100 μm) and then carefully covered with a coverslip (see Figure 2). In this step, it is very important for the node to be close to the coverslip without deforming the shape of the node. Please note that we index-matched samples to minimize spherical aberration.Finally, it was sealed with nail polish. Samples were stored at 4 °C for approximately one week.",
    "3D-STED observation: 3D-STED imaging was performed as follows:Bit depth: 16 bitChannel 1: excitation wavelength 561 nm (white light laser pulse), detection wavelength for HyD 571–623 nm, gating 0.3–6 ns, depletion wavelength 775 nm (pulse)Channel 2: excitation wavelength 633 nm (white light laser pulse), detection wavelength for HyD 650–700 nm, gating 0.3–6 ns, depletion wavelength 775 nm (pulse)z-donut: 60%–80% (typically 80%)Pinhole setting: 0.5 AU at 640 nmBefore observation, it is better to perform Beam alignment.Note that in STED microscopy, the excitation light is overlapped with the STED beam, quenching excited molecules in the excitation spot periphery. In this setting, we used the same wavelength of the STED beam for Channel 1 and Channel 2 (see depletion wavelength), so chromatic aberration does not occur.Analysis of 3D images is described below in Analysis of Pkd2 distribution for STED images."
