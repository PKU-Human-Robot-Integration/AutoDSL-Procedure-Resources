    "The following protocol was examined and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Houston. All infant subjects’ parents or guardians received, read, and signed a consent form prior to participation. Parents received free parking and a $20 gift card as compensation for their participation in the study whereas the infants chose an age-appropriate toy.\nThe recruited infant subjects met the following criteria: 1) Age between 6 and 24 months. 2) Infant was healthy, had normal growth and development, and had no history of natal issues, concussions, seizures, strokes, or learning disabilities. Examples of some common developmental disabilities that would exclude an infant from testing are failure to thrive, undernourishment, and use of alcohol or drugs by the mother during pregnancy.\nA simplified flow diagram for the simultaneous recording of multimodal neural activity via scalp EEG and IMUs in freely behaving infants is presented in Figure 1.\n1. Informed Consent\nShow parents the experimental room and briefly explain the purpose of the experiment to them.\n2. Scalp EEG Preparation\nNote: The EEG system used (Table 1) consists of an active electrode system with removable electrodes. Impedance levels are indicated on the electrodes using LEDs.\nMeasure the infant’s head circumference in cm. Place a measuring tape around the widest part of the head, passing it over the eyebrows and around the occipital prominence in the back of the head.\n\tNote: Measuring the head circumference is necessary for selecting an appropriately sized EEG cap. There are special sizes for the infant population described in Table 1.\nPlace electrodes on an appropriately sized EEG cap (Table 1) as specified by the 10-20 international system. The cap ensures proper placement of the electrodes on the scalp.",
    "Note: It is preferable to have the cap ready by the time the infant arrives to the study location. Information about the head size can be obtained from the parents before time, or approximated using tables available online [http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/html_charts/hcageinf.htm]. If the head measurement does not correspond to the researcher’s approximation, a new cap must be prepared. If multiple caps and electrodes are available, multiple caps can be set up in advance to minimize preparation time.\nExplain the gelling procedure to the parent. Show them the blunt needle and syringe used to apply gel to each electrode and let them feel the needle on their skin. Use a demo EEG electrode and scalp cap to go over the gelling procedure.\nMeasure the distance from the nasion to the inion along the midsagittal plane of the surface of the scalp. Proceed to fit the scalp cap from behind the infant.\nAlign the Cz electrode with the vertex of the head. Proceed to align and center the Fp1 and Fp2 electrodes on the forehead at approximately 10% of the distance between the nasion and the inion. Align the scalp cap symmetrically along the midsagittal plane of the head. Make sure mid-electrodes [AFz, Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz, POz, Oz] are aligned with the nasion and inion. When done, secure the cap by strapping below the chin.\n\tNote: Distract the infant while he/she is being fitted with the EEG cap. An age appropriate video is commonly used to distract infants during setup.\n Connect the reference, ground, and recording electrodes to the control box. Turn on the impedance indicators from the control box.",
    "Starting with ground and reference electrodes, use a small syringe to inject electrolyte gel into the space between the scalp and electrode until the impedance of each electrode measures below 60 kΩ. This is indicated by a yellow or green light on the electrodes. Further details on EEG electrode preparation are available in 4.\n\tNote: During the gelling procedure, the infant might move his/her head for various reasons (curiosity, fear, diverted attention). It is therefore recommended that the second experimenter or parent continues to distract the infant. Use the syringes from behind the infant’s head to avoid the risk of hitting the infant’s face with the needle due to unexpected movement of the subject.\nConnect the amplifiers to the host PC via a USB port using a fiber-optic to USB converter.\n\tNote: Figure 2A shows the infant subject setup with the EEG cap and the IMU placement. Notice that the electrode cables and the control box are held up, providing load-free mobility to the subject. Figure 2B displays a topographic view of the EEG cap’s electrode locations following the 10-20 labeling system.\n3. IMUs Preparation\nOpen the IMU software. Click on “New” on the graphical interface. \nThen click “Configure” in the dialog box to configure IMUs. Set the sampling frequency to 128 Hz.\nSecure the IMUs on the head, chest, and left and right wrists of the infant.\n\tNote: See Figure 2A. In parallel, fit the experiment’s wrists with IMUs. Make sure IMUs are secured well to the body to minimize inertial measurement errors.\nUsing straps, place the wrist IMUs on the dorsal side of the wrists. Place the chest IMU on the ventral surface near the center of the chest using a harness.",
    "Attach the head IMU to the chin straps of the scalp cap so that it is near the left side of the chin. Position the IMUs so that they face outward, with the LED light oriented up.\n\tNote: The IMUs each weigh about 22 g, and their small size and light weight are unlikely to impede movement. An additional experimenter may be needed to distract the infant for reasons described in step 2.8.\n4. Video Capture and Synchronization of Data Streams\nPlace video camera (18) so that the infant (12), the actor (14), and the LED trigger (13) are all clearly visible. See Figure 4.\n\tNote: Video recordings are used to allow visual annotation and segmentation of behaviors triggered by the experimenter, as well as confirmation of the beginning and end of the recording session.\nConnect the trigger input/output enclosure (7) to the EEG (5) and IMUs (4). See Figure 3.\n\tNote: A custom input/output enclosure (7), shown in Figure 3, was designed for aligning all recorded data streams (EEG, IMUs, and video) and thus use event markers from one recording (such as video) or aid the analysis of another recording (such as EEG or acceleration). This is accomplished by using a single momentary pushbutton that, when depressed, will send an active-low (+V to Ground) trigger pulse to EEG (via a DB-25 parallel port), IMU (via a mini-DIN-6 connector), and video (by illuminating a light-emitting diode (LED) positioned in view of the video camera) recordings simultaneously. A 7404 IC logic invertor chip was used to transform the low-state (Ground) to a high-state (+V) pulse, providing the voltage potential needed to power the LED.",
    "Have an experimenter in close proximity to the trigger pushbutton and the data collection computer. The experimenter is in charge of operating the trigger, monitoring the data quality throughout the experiment, and saving the data.\n5. Preparation of Testing Environment\nSee Figure 4. \n6. Data Collection\nRecord the initial impedance values of the EEG electrodes using the control software by selecting the “Impedance Check” tab, clicking the radio button “Impedance On” (wait about 5 sec for electrode impedance values to stabilize), and clicking the “Save impedance” radio button to save impedances. See Figure 5.\nNo filters are applied during EEG data collection.\nIn the EEG recorder program, click on “Monitor” then “Play” to start recoding EEG data. See Figure 6.\nIn the IMU software, click “Stream” and then “Record” in the dialog box to start recording IMU data. See Figure 7.\nApply three triggers (III) to signal the start of the experiment using the pushbutton on the input/output enclosure (7). Let the infant rest for 1 min while recording. This provides initial baseline data.\nPerform experiment and allow the infant subject take breaks as needed. Each experiment trial consists of a turn-taking task where the actor shows an action to the infant using an object (usually, but not always, a toy), passes it to the infant in an effort to initiate an imitation response, and finally retrieves the object back from the infant.\n\tNote: This exchange is generally repeated for 4-5 trials or until the infant shows no further interest in the object.\nGiven the environment of the session, annotate all timings of each behavior after data collection using the video recording.\nRecord the final impedance values of the EEG electrodes. See step 6.1.",
    "Digitize the 3D spatial coordinates of the EEG electrodes using the EEG electrode 3D scanner and software and its corresponding software.\nStart the 3D scanning software. Go to “File” and select “new workspace”. Load the electrode position file in the first tab of the workspace and provide the necessary information in the storage tab.\nIn the scanning toolbar, click on “start scanning”. Use the 3D scanner, at approximately 30 cm from the infant’s head, to scan the electrode locations by following the changing light patterns on the cap. Once the scanning is complete, the software will automatically save the results.\n\tNote: At the back of the head, the cables may block the LEDs on the electrodes due to the small size of the infant’s head. The software allows the user to remove some electrodes from the scan without compromising the results. Remove the occipital electrodes from the scan if necessary.\n7. Behavioral Segmentation\nInspect the video recording of the experiment session and mark the time when the trigger LED blinks (i.e., when the experiment begins and ends), and when any of the previously mentioned behaviors in step 6.6 start and end.\n8. Source Imaging\nNote: Source imaging can accurately identify the generators of EEG potentials within the brain and it usually consists of solving the forward and the inverse problem 5.\nAcquire High resolution T1 weighted Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) data from public domain databases such as the Neurodevelopmental MRI database which contains average MRI templates as a function of age (in months) for the first two years of life 6,7.\n\tNote: This study uses only age-appropriate forward head models of infants and therefore sex information is not taken into account when selecting the MRI template.)",
    "Acquire source volumes for boundary element models (BEM) that include head compartments (i.e., gray matter, white matter, scalp, inner or outer skull) as MRI volumes from the Neurodevelopmental MRI database 8.\nPre-process BEM MRI volume to obtain a realistic head model by extracting the surface of the brain and head compartments in Curry 7, or similar brain imaging software package.\n Import the T1 weighted MRI. Manually identify the three fiducial points such as right/left pre-auricular points and nasion within the brain imaging software, or similar package.\n Co-register EEG and MRI space to obtain the rigid geometrical transformation between the MRI‘s space and the subject‘s space by fitting the fiducial points indicated on MRI and the fiducials obtained with 3D scanner in steps 6.9-6.11 using the brain imaging software or similar package.\nSolve the forward model.\n\tNote: The forward problem involves the definition of a head model that represents the geometry of the head and of the electrical conductivity properties of the head volume 9,10.\nSolve the inverse problem\n\tNote: The inverse problem tries to infer a location, strength and a time course of a source in the brain from the scalp EEG signals by using signal processing techniques 11.\nSegment continuous EEG data into trials around the task onset (e.g., imitation, observation segments) with pre- and post-task onset segments of 2 sec length. Identify channels with high impedance as “bad channels” and other artifactual trials in each trial. Pre-process the EEG data for artifact rejection using ICA and reconstruct the bad channels with the average of neighboring artifact-free channels. 12,13,14.\nUse the forward model as an input to an automated optimization algorithm that searches over the entire brain to identify the best possible source locations.",
    "Visually analyze the estimated sources and pick up the solutions that most match your expectation based on prior knowledge from the nature of experiment and interpret them carefully.\n\tNote: This step is the most biased one due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, that is, different configurations of the sources may result in the same surface potentials. Therefore, it may be helpful to perform a sanity check to verify that a given head model and inverse method works well.\nPerform a sanity check, localizing a known simulated dipole. Namely, for the given head model place a dipole with known configuration, and solve the forward problem to obtain simulated voltages for this dipole.\nSolve the inverse problem with these voltages on the same head model, to make sure it returns the simulated dipoles.\n\tNote: These sanity checks should return the dipoles initially placed to a high degree of accuracy."
