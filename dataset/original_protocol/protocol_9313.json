    "1. Preparation\nCyanobacterial cultures\nGrow Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 at 30 °C in liquid BG11 medium8, with a constant supply of air supplemented with 1% (v/v) CO2. Illuminate the cultures continuously with light at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 50 µmol photon/m2/s.\nGrow Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 in liquid A+ medium23 (BG11 medium can also be used), with a constant supply of air supplemented with 1% (v/v) CO2. The temperature should be 37 °C. Illuminate the cultures continuously with light at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 150 µmol photon/m2/s.\nMeasure the optical density (OD) of the culture at 730 nm using a cuvette with a light path of 1 cm. If the OD value is above 0.8, make appropriate dilutions to obtain OD measurements that are proportional to the cell concentration.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocols presented below are suitable for liquid cultures, with a cell density corresponding to an OD730nm value of 2 or higher. When cultures in the exponential growth phase are desired, which typically have an OD730nm value below 1, concentrate the cell density by centrifugation and resuspension in a buffer or medium to achieve an OD730nm value of 2 or higher.\nBuffers and reagents\nMake 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.\nMake 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.\nMake a stock solution of 8 U/mL amyloglucosidase in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.\nMake a stock solution of 2 U/mL α-amylase in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.\nUsing distilled water, makeglucose standard solutions at concentrations ranging between 0 and 100 µg/mL,.\nPrepare GOD-POD reagent from the D-Glucose Assay Kit (GODPOD Format), following the manufacturer´s instruction.\n2. Determination of the Cell Dry Weight (Optional)",
    "Transfer 2 mL of a culture or a cell resuspension (see step 1.1) to a 2.0 mL tube and centrifuge at 6,000 x g and 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of water and centrifuge at 6,000 x g and 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 0.5 mL of water.\nTransfer the suspension to a pre-weighed aluminum tray. Transfer the tray to a drying oven at 105 °C for overnight drying (approximately 18 h).\n\tCRITICAL: It is important that the tray is handled with forceps to avoid the transfer of material from the fingers. Dry an empty, pre-weighed aluminum tray under the same conditions to determine any weight loss from the trays during drying.\nAfter drying, remove the tray from the oven and allow it to equilibrate at ambient conditions for 5 min before weighing it with an accuracy of 0.0001 g.\n\tNOTE: The value can be used to normalize the glycogen content on a cell-dry-weight basis.\n3. Lysis of Cyanobacterial Cells\nTransfer 1 mL of a culture or a cell resuspension (see step 1.1) to a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge at 6,000 x g and 4 °C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and centrifuge at 6,000 x g and 4 °C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of the Tris-HCl buffer. Repeat the process.\nThoroughly resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.\n\tCRITICAL: Resuspend the pellet well for an efficient cell lysis. Keep the resuspension in ice.",
    "Lyse the resuspended cells at 4 °C by performing 30 cycles of ultrasonication, each cycle consisting of 30 s at a frequency of 20 kHz with the maximum amplitude, followed by 90 s without.\n\tNOTE: This method can efficiently lyse Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.\n\t\nAlternatively, transfer the cell resuspension to a screw-cap tube and add zirconium oxide beads to the tube, following manufacturer's instructions. Set the tube in a tissue homogenizer and lyse the cells at 4 °C by performing 2 cycles of beating, each cycle consisting of 5 min at the frequency setting of 5.\n\t\tNOTE: This method can efficiently lyse Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.\nCentrifuge the tube containing the lysate for 10 min at 6,000 x g and 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The pellet should mainly consist of large cell debris. If there is a significant number of unbroken cells, repeat step 3.4. Keep the supernatant on ice.\nDetermine the protein concentration using a commercial BCA Protein assay kit.\n\tNOTE: The value can be used to normalize the glycogen content on a protein content basis.\n4. Glycogen Precipitation\nRemove chlorophyll a from the cell lysate by mixing 900 µL of 96% (v/v) ethanol and 100 µL of the supernatant from step 3.5 in a 1.5 mL screw-cap tube. After closing the cap, heat the tube at 90 °C for 10 min using a standard laboratory heating block.\nIncubate the tube on ice for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the tube at 20,000 x g and 4 °C for 30 min and carefully remove the supernatant; the pellet contains glycogen. Lightly dry the pellet in air to remove excess ethanol.\n\tCRITICAL:Excessive drying of the pellet must be avoided, otherwise it becomes difficult to solubilize in step 5.1.",
    "OPTIONAL: Measure the absorbance of the supernatant obtained in step 4.3 at 664 nm to determine the chlorophyll a content. Use an absorption coefficient of 84.6 L/g/cm24.\n\tNOTE: The value can be used to normalize the glycogen content.\n5. Enzymatic Hydrolysis and Glycogen Determination\nSolubilize the pellet obtained in step 4.3 in 100 µL of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, and add 50 µL of 8 U/mL amyloglucosidase and 50 µL of 2 U/mL α-amylase. Mix these materials well using a vortex.\n\tNOTE: Mixing by pipetting is not recommended because the glycogen pellet is viscous.\nIncubate the mixture at 60 °C on a heating block for 2 h to enable the digestion of glycogen into glucose molecules.\nCentrifuge the sample at 10,000 x g for 5 min and transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\n6. Determination of the Total Glucose Content Using the GOD-POD Reagent\nMeasure the concentration of glucose in the supernatant obtained in step 5.3 using the GOD-POD reagent. Transfer 100 µL of the supernatant from step 5.3 to a well in a 96-well plate. As a negative control, use 100 µL of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5. For generating a calibration curve, also measure the glucose standard solutions.\nAdd 150 µL of GOD-POD reagent to each sample and quickly mix by pipetting.\nIncubate the plate statically at 25 °C for 30 min. Record the absorbance value at 510 nm using a plate reader.\nCalculate the concentration of glucose using a calibration curve obtained from the glucose standards.\n\tNOTE: The glycogen concentration in the cell lysate is expressed as the concentration of glucose (µg/mL).\nSubscription Required.
