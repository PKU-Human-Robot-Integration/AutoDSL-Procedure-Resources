If not able to pipette it all out, allow the tubes to dry upright.\nAs soon as the pellet is dry, resuspend in 20.4 μL of 5× ADPRC buffer and 63.7 μL of Nuclease-free H20.\nAllow the samples to resuspend for 20 min on ice before proceeding.\nFor copper click reaction per sample,\nPrepare copper mix.\nAdd 2 μL of 50 mM CuSO4.",

Allow samples to resuspend on ice for 25 min.\nPCR amplification.\nPut the 6 μL of DSN-treated samples in new PCR tubes.\nMake the Phusion PCR mix, which is everything listed below except for the index primer.\nAdd 50 μL of 2× Phusion Mix.\nAdd 40 μL of 5 mM Betaine.\nAdd 2 μL of 10 μM RNA PCR Primer.\nNote: Make 10% extra reagent if you are preparing multiple samples. A different PCR Index Primer is used for each sample, so add this directly to the sample rather than including in the master mix.\nAdd 92 μL of the Phusion PCR mix and 2 μL of the appropriate PCR Index Primer to each DSN-treated sample.\nDivide each 100 μL of sample volume into 4 PCR tubes (25 μL/tube).\nSet the PCR program on PCR machine.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1167_16.csv\nMerge the 100 μL of PCR product in a 1.5 mL tube.\nPrecipitate the DNA by adding 3 μL of glycogen, 10 μL of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.5), and 300 μL of 100% EtOH.\nLeave at −80°C at least 1 h.\nPause point: If not doing the size selection the same day, leave at −80°C for 12–16 h.",
    "Centrifuge at maximum speed for at least 60 min at 4°C. If only at −80°C for 1 h, increase spin by 10 min.\nRemove supernatant. Wash with 750 μL of 80% EtOH.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min at 4°C.\nPipette out as much of the supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet. If not able to pipette it all out, allow the tubes to dry upright.\nResuspend DNA in 10 μL of Nuclease-free H2O. Allow samples to resuspend on ice for 25 min.\nForth size selection and quantification.\nPut 6% TBE polyacrylamide gel (10 wells) in the gel box such that the wells face inward, place a balancer opposite if run only one gel, and lock it into position. Pour about 700 mL of 1× TBE buffer into the gel box.\nNote: There is no urea in this gel, so there is no need to pre-run it.\nPrepare the ladder and samples:\nMix 1.5 μL of Ultra Low Range DNA Ladder, 8.5 μL of Nuclease-free H2O, and 10 μL of Gel Loading Buffer II.\nAdd 10 μL of Gel Loading Buffer II to each of the samples.\nNote: There is no need to pre-heat DNA sample.\nLoad the DNA ladder and samples into the gel.\nCritical: Keep a space between samples and avoid the ends.\nRun gel at 155 V for about 30 min.\nNote: Until the purple dye touches the bottom of the gel.\nWhile running, poke holes in 0.5 mL tubes using a 21 G needle and place inside 2 mL tubes.\nOptional: you can use 0.5 mL Gel Breaker Tubes that already have holes, but you still need to increase the size of the holes by running a 21 G needle through each hole.",
    "Stain the gel with ethidium bromide. Add 14 μL of 10 mg/mL EtBr to 200 mL of 1× TBE buffer in a clean RNase-free tray. Add the gel and rock for 7 min.\nTake a picture of the gel. Then cut the gel in the region corresponding to 168 bp to the end of signal using a clean razor blade and put the gel slice in the 0.5 mL tubes.\nNote: Adapter-adapter dimer is 118 bp at this point, and the first RNA size selection is 50–250 nt, so the preferred size range in this selection is 168–368 bp.\nCritical: The razor blade needs to be sterilized with 100% EtOH and should be changed when cutting the gel lanes corresponding to each different sample to avoid sample cross-contamination.\nSpin the samples at 14,000 rpm, 4°C for 2 min. Make sure most/all of the gel goes through the holes. If not, spin again for 1 min, poking more holes in the tubes if necessary.\nAdd 300 μL of 1× NEB Buffer 2 and rotate for 2 h.\nAfter 2 h, pipette the entire sample into a Spin-X column, and spin at 14000 rpm, 4°C for 2 min. Make sure all of the liquid spins out. There should be about 300 μL. Spin longer if necessary.\nPrecipitate the DNA by adding 3 μL of glycogen, 30 μL of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.5), and 900 μL of 100% EtOH.\nLeave at −80°C at least 2 h.\nPause point: We usually leave the samples at −80°C overnight at this stage.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for at least 60 min at 4°C. If only at −80°C for 1 h, increase spin by 10 min.\nRemove supernatant. Wash with 750 μL of 80% EtOH.\nCentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Pipette out as much of the supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet. If not able to pipette it all out, allow the tubes to dry upright.\nAs soon as the pellet is dry, resuspend in 12 μL of Nuclease-free H2O.\nQuantify the library concentration using a Nanodrop and sequence the resulting libraries."
