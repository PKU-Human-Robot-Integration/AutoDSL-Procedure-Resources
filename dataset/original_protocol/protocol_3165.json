This setting generates a microenvironment that permits tumor spheroid to invade three-dimensionally.\nCollect a spheroid with a cut tip in a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nRemove the supernatant and let the spheroid in a small residual volume.\nWash carefully the spheroid with 100 μL PBS twice.\nRemove the PBS and let the spheroid in a small residual volume.\nInclude the spheroid in collagen:\npipette 150 μL of collagen matrix with a cut tip,\nresuspend the spheroid in the collagen matrix,\naspirate the spheroid and the collagen matrix with the same tip, and,\nplace it gently on the permeable support for 24-well plate with a 0.8 μm transparent PET membrane (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2935-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Scale bar 100 μm.\nNote: Center the spheroid in the permeable support. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nIncubate 30 min at 37°C.\nAdd 150 μL of NBM in the well.\nIncubate 24 h at 37°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nCritical: Before removing the supernatant, wait for the spheroid to pellet in the tube.\nCritical: Do not remove the whole liquid in which the spheroid is immersed.\nSample fixation and partial dehydration\nTiming: 5 h\nThis step includes the fixation of samples in paraformaldehyde and first dehydration stages. Fixation is an important stage in histology, as it stabilizes proteins while preserving tissue structure.\nFix the sample:",
    "remove the supernatant by inverting the insert,\nfill the insert with 500 μL paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4%,\nincubate 4 h at 24°C.\nNote: Due to PFA toxicity, it is mandatory to use a laboratory forceps to handle the permeable insert.\nRemove PFA 4% by inverting the permeable support.\nWash the sample with PBS thrice.\nRemove PBS by inverting the permeable support.\nFill the insert with 500 μL of ethanol 70% and incubate 1 h at 24°C.\nRemove ethanol 70% by inverting the insert.\nFill the insert with 500 μL of ethanol 70% and incubate 12 h at 24°C.\nNote: At the end of this step, the sample can be stored in ethanol 70% at 4°C for several days.\nInclusion of samples in an agarose matrix 1%\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step enables samples to be embedded with agarose gel for easier handling.\nRemove ethanol 70% by inverting the insert.\nPrepare liquid agarose 1%:\ndissolve 1% of agarose in distilled water using a microwave while avoiding boiling,\nallow the gel to cool down to approximately 37°C–40°C,\nInclude the sample in agarose:\nfill the insert with 500 μL of liquid agarose gel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Ai),\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2935-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Embedding of the sample in agarose\n(A) Schematic representation of the different steps. (i) The insert is filled with agarose. (ii) The permeable insert is flipped down and the membrane is carefully removed to demold the sample. (iii) A part of the agarose is removed by cutting with a scalpel.

The liquid paraffin is then used to infiltrate the sample to protect it and ensure long preservation. The main purpose of paraffin inclusion is to obtain histological sections.\nImmerse the cassette in successive baths of:\nethanol 96% at 24°C for 1 h, twice.\nethanol absolute at 24°C 12 h.\nethanol absolute at 24°C for 1 h.\nNote: Sample can be stored in ethanol absolute at 4°C for a few days, it will be necessary to repeat an ethanol absolute bath for 1 h before incubating into toluene.\ntoluene at 24°C for 45 min, twice. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nliquid paraffin 60°C for 1 h, twice.\nInsert the sample in the desired direction in the inclusion block and embed with paraffin.\nNote: Paraffin embedded samples can be stored for a very long time at 24°C.\nBlade sectioning\nTiming: 24 h",
    "The paraffin block is cut with a microtome to produce thin section for subsequent histological analyses. Sections are collected on glass slides and dried.\nSection the paraffin block with a thickness of 10 μm (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2935-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Scale bar 400 μm.\n(B) Image of the invasive spheroid. Scale bar 100 μm.\nOn a slide covered with water heated to 37°C, place the paraffin section on the hot water to expand.\nRemove water.\nDry them at 37°C 12–24 h.\nNote: Paraffin section can be stored for a very long time at 4°C.\nStaining procedures and acquisition\nTiming: 2 days\nMost tissues are transparent, slide staining can be used to identify individual tissue elements. Before immunostaining, fixed paraffin-embedded tissues need to undergo few steps, such as deparaffinization, antigen retrieval and permeabilization.\nImmerse the paraffin-embedded sections in:\ntoluene at 24°C for 5 min, twice.\nethanol at 24°C absolute for 5 min.\nethanol at 24°C 96% for 5 min.\nethanol at 24°C 70% for 5 min.\ndistilled H2O at 24°C for 5 min.\ncitrate buffer at 95°C for 1 h.\nStaining.\nPermeabilize the samples with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min.\nWash in PBS for 5 min.\nBlock with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% donkey serum in PBS (blocking buffer) for 1 h.\nDelineate the section with hydrophobic pen.\nIncubate with primary antibodies (1:100) in blocking buffer 12–24 h at 4°C.\nWash in PBS thrice.\nIncubate 1 h at 24°C the samples in blocking buffer containing:\nSecondary antibodies (1:200),\nDAPI (1:2,000) for staining DNA,\nPhalloidin rhodamine (1:500) for staining cytoskeleton.\nWash in PBS thrice.",
