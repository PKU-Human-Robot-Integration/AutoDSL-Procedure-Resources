    "Pyocyanin extractionInoculate Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 from frozen stock on an LB agar plate and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C.Pipette 5 ml of BMM into 3 sterile test tubes, inoculate isolated colonies of PAO1 grown on LB agar, and incubate for 16 h at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Measure OD600 (BioMate3 spectrophotometer) of the 3 biological replicates and normalize cell cultures to OD600 = 0.3 by diluting with fresh BMM.Inoculate 2 μl of normalized culture onto the center of a freshly made (3-4 h after pouring) swarming plate (described in Recipes section) and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C. Cut each swarming colony together with the agar it occupies in half using a razor blade. Transfer ½ of the swarming colony into a small plastic container using a plastic spatula (Figure 1) and add 5 ml of saline (0.85% NaCl).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161129/20161129233954_0305.jpgFigure 1. Transferring ½ of the swarming colony with the agar it occupies into a plastic containerUsing a potato masher, mash the agar into small pieces (Figure 2) and transfer the agar along with saline into a 40 ml glass scintillation vial (glass separation funnel can be used instead). Repeat for two other replicates.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161129/20161129234038_2097.jpgFigure 2. Smashing the collected swarming colony and agar into small pieces in preparation for extractionRinse the container and the masher with another 5 ml of saline, collecting all the remaining pieces of agar, and combine with the first portion containing the smashed agar. Using a glass pipette, add 5 ml of chloroform to the glass vials containing smashed agar. Secure the glass vials to the table top orbital shaker and shake the vials at speed setting 3 for 15 min at room temperature.",
    "To avoid the toxic effect of chloroform, all the steps involving the solvent should be done in a fume hood.After shaking, stand the vials vertically to let the layers separate. This will take about 10 min. By using a glass Pasteur pipette, transfer the bottom chloroform layer into a clean scintillation vial. Note: If pyocyanin is present, this layer will be tinted blue.Repeat steps A7-A10 adding chloroform two more times to the glass vials containing smashed agar and combine all three chloroform fractions for each replicate in one vial.Add 5 ml of 0.2 N HCl and shake the vials using a table top orbital shaker at speed setting 3 for 15 min at room temperature.After shaking, stand the vials vertically to let the layers separate. This will take about 10 min. By using a glass Pasteur pipette, collect the top HCl layer and transfer 200 μl of it to a flat bottom 96-well plate. Note: If pyocyanin is present, this layer will be tinted red. Measure absorbance at 520 nm (SynergyTM Mx Biotek plate reader).Calculate the concentration of pyocyanin in μg/ml by using the extinction coefficient of 17.1 (Kurachi, 1958).Total cellular protein quantificationUse the remaining half of the swarming colony from step A5 of pyocyanin extraction protocol above.Transfer the remaining ½ of the swarming colony into a small plastic container and pipette 5 ml of saline into it Using a potato masher, mash the agar into small pieces and transfer the agar along with saline into a 50 ml Falcon tube (Figure 2).Rinse the container and masher with 5 ml of saline to collect all the remaining pieces of agar and transfer to the Falcon tube used in the previous step, thus combining all the pieces of the mashed agar.",
    "Sonicate the mixture for 15 min in a Branson 2800 water-bath sonicator (with default setting), then vortex for 5 min. Repeat this step two more times. Gently pellet agar pieces by centrifuging for 2 min at 1,000 x g, carefully collect the supernatant without disturbing the agar, and transfer into a clean 50 ml Falcon tube. Add 10 ml of saline to agar pellet and repeat steps B4-B5. Add another 10 ml and repeat steps B4-B5. Combine all the collected supernatants and filter through a Whatman No. 1 filter to remove any leftover agar pieces. Apply vacuum if needed. Transfer the filtered supernatant into a clean 50 ml centrifuge vial. Centrifuge the filtrate at 17,000 x g for 10 min at 25 °C (Sorvall RC 6+ centrifuge with rotor type F13-14x50 cy). Collect the pellet, resuspend it in 1 ml of 1 N NaOH, and transfer into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Heat the samples at 90 °C for 10 min and centrifuge for 5 min at 15,000 x g (Eppendorf 5424 centrifuge) at room temperature. Transfer the supernatants to a new microfuge tube for Bradford analysis. Depending on the protein yield, samples may need to be diluted. In our experiments, we diluted samples 10 times with saline.Take 20 μl of each sample and mix with 200 μl of Bradford reagent in a 96-well flat bottom plate. Assay Bovine Serum Albumin protein standards in the same plate. Measure absorbance at 595 nm (SynergyTM Mx Biotech plate reader). Calculate protein concentration according to the BSA standard curve and use it to normalize the pyocyanin data."
