    "1. Fabrication of the two-piece channel and modular platform base\nNOTE: The microfluidic channel is constructed using two parts — the microfluidic channel \"cutout\", which is razor cut from a poly dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) sheet of defined thickness, and the channel cover, which reversibly bonds to the cutout and forms the channel. The channel is surrounded by a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) frame that will acts as a media reservoir (Figure 1). The PMMA frame can also be used to magnetically latch specialized modules for added functionality.\nRazor cutting channels from PDMS sheets:\n\tNOTE: The microfluidic channel design for this step is provided in Supplementary Figure 1. The channel consists of five segments of length 5 mm each and widths of 10 mm, 5 mm, 2.5 mm, 1.25 mm, and 0.75 mm. The velocity of the collagen solution, injected at a constant flow rate (50-400 µL·min−1), increases locally along the channel as the channel width is decreased to generate extensional flow.\n\t\nMount a 250 µm thick PDMS sheet onto a plastic carrier sheet and razor-cut the microfluidic design using a craft cutter at a blade depth of 0.5 mm, 1 cm·s−1 speed, and high force.\nUsing an ultrasonic bath, clean the microfluidic channel cutouts for 5 min. Rinse the sonicated channels in deionized (DI) water and dry them on a clean hotplate at 100 ˚C for 5 min.\nStore the channels in a clean, covered Petri dish until use.\nFabricating the PDMS cover and surface passivation:",
    "NOTE: The channel cutout from section 1.1 requires a cover that can be placed on top of it to create an enclosed channel that a COL1 solution can be injected into (Supplementary Figure 1). The cover can be removed after the COL1 has self-assembled. To minimize the chances of the COL1 in the channel binding to the cover, the cover is passivated using bovine serum albumin (BSA). The mold design for the PDMS cover is provided. The mold must be at least 2 mm in thickness and should have a footprint that is equal to the footprint of the microfluidic channel cutout. In this protocol, the mold footprint was 35 mm x 15 mm.\n\t\nTo prepare the mold, affix a sheet of pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) to a 2.5 mm thick sheet of PMMA and laser cut the desired mold shape.\nClean the laser-cut PMMA mold with a damp, lint-free wipe and remove the backing from the PSA film. Attach the mold to a 100 mm diameter silicon wafer bt pressing down firmly.\nPrepare PDMS in a ratio of 10:1 (base:crosslinker). Mix vigorously for 1 min to ensure proper mixing and degas the mixture in a vacuum chamber to remove air bubbles.\nPour the degassed PDMS solution into the PMMA/silicon mold and cure on a hotplate at 100 ˚C for 20 min. Allow the mold to cool, remove the cured PDMS, and trim any excess with a razor blade.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the silicon wafer facing sides (flat sides) of the PDMS covers are facing up throughout all the following steps.",
    "Use a 1 mm diameter biopsy punch to create inlet and outlet holes that correspond to the ends of the microfluidic channel. The channel cutout from step 1.1 may be used as a template to guide the position of the holes.\nSonicate the cover in isopropanol (IPA) for 5 min, rinse with DI water, dry with a compressed air source, and then store in a clean, covered Petri dish. Place the Petri dish in a UV sterilization chamber (uncovered) for 1 min to sterilize.\nCover and transfer to a biosafety cabinet (BSC).\nPipette 300 µL of 40 mg•mL-1 bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) onto the PDMS covers and spread the solution evenly using a pipette tip. Place in a refrigerator at 4 ˚C for at least 4 h before use.\nMove the covers from the refrigerator into a BSC, wash 5x with 1x PBS, and let them dry in air for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The PDMS covers can be stored in the fridge for up to 1 week after coating them with BSA.\nGlutaraldehyde treatment of coverslips\n\tNOTE: Functionalizing the coverslips with glutaraldehyde covalently bonds COL1 to the coverslip and prevents the hydrogel from detaching.\n\t\nPrepare a 2% (v/v) aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) solution in a glass beaker by adding 1 mL of APTES to 49 mL of acetone.\nDilute a 25% glutaraldehyde solution to 5% in DI water. Make 2 mL of solution for each 24 mm x 50 mm coverslip. For 24 mm x 24 mm or 22 mm x 22 mm coverslips, make 1 mL of solution for each.",
    "Clean the coverslips in a bath sonicator for 5 min using IPA. Rinse off the IPA from the coverslips using DI water. The IPA is completely rinsed when a smooth film of water can be seen on the coverslip.\nDry the coverslips on a hot plate for 5 min at 100 °C. Place the dried coverslips into clean Petri dishes, ensuring they do not overlap.\nUsing a corona discharge wand, expose the coverslips to a corona discharge for 1 min each.\n\t\tNOTE: This step should be performed in a well-ventilated area or a chemical hood.\nRemove the coverslips from the Petri dish and then immerse into the APTES solution for 10 s within 5 min of corona exposure, ensuring the coverslip is submerged.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure to keep track of which side was treated with plasma and keep it facing upward.\nThen, immerse the coverslip into acetone for 10 s and dry with compressed air. Place the dry coverslip back into the Petri dish, treated side facing up.\n\t\tNOTE: Repeat steps 1.3.5-1.3.7 for all the coverslips.\nPipette 1 mL of glutaraldehyde solution onto the surface of each coverslip. Cover as much surface as possible without allowing the solution to spill over the edge of the coverslip. More glutaraldehyde solution can be added if necessary. Make sure not to scratch the surface with the pipette tip.\nLet the coverslips sit in contact with the solution for 30 min and then rinse with DI water for 20 s. Dry the coverslips using compressed air and place them back in the Petri dishes, plasma treated side up.\n\t\tNOTE: The coverslips can be stored for up to 1 week at room temperature (RT).\nLaser cutting the modular magnetic base",
    "NOTE: The design of the modular magnetic base is provided in Supplementary Figure 1. The modular base serves as a well to hold the media and can also be used to magnetically attach specialized modules, as described in previously published works22,37,38,39.\n\t\nCut out the designs from the PMMA layer using appropriate laser settings such as the number of passes and power.\n\t\tNOTE: The laser settings should be adjusted such that the magnets can be press fitted in the PMMA layer. Each laser is different, and the cut parameters must be optimized experimentally. For a 45 W laser, 100% speed, 100% power, and 3 passes are recommended for cutting 2 mm through 2 mm thick PMMA.\nWash the laser-cut part using soap and water to remove debris from the laser-cutting process.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not use solvents to clean the laser-cut parts. Solvents may result in the propagation of microcracks in the laser-cut edges.\nAssembling the platform\n\t\nPush magnets (3/16 in diameter, 1/16 in thick) by hand into the laser-cut base. A soft hammer or screw-driver end may be used to help push in the magnet. The thickness of the magnets must be less than the thickness of the PMMA base to ensure the magnets are flush with the surface of the base.\n\t\tNOTE: The magnets allow the user to add functionality to the platform by attaching additional modules.\nPeel off the backing from the PSA sheet and attach the base to a glutaraldehyde-treated coverslip with the functionalized side facing up.\nGently place the PDMS channel cutout into the cavity defined by the frame. Press down with wide-tip tweezers to remove air bubbles and ensure conformal contact.",
    "Place the BSA-treated channel cover on top of the channel cutout, with the BSA side facing down. Ensure the fluid inlet and outlet ports are aligned with the channel.\nThe device is ready for the COL1 injection.\n2. Injecting the COL1 solution into the microchannel and removing the cover for cell culture applications\nPreparing the COL1 solution\n\t\nPlace all the required reagents (COL1 stock solution [6 mg·mL−1], ultrapure water, 10x PBS, 0.1 M NaOH) on ice in the biosafety cabinet.\nCalculate the volume of reagents as follows\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64457/64457eq01v2.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64457/64457eq02.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64457/64457eq03.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64457/64457eq04.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: Therefore, to make 1 mL of 2.5 mg·mL−1 neutralized collagen from a 6 mg·mL−1 stock, add 416.67 µL of collagen, 429.16 µL of DI water, 100 µL of 10x PBS, and 54.16 µL of 0.1 M NaOH for a final pH of 7. Add 20 µL of 0.1 M NaOH to achieve a pH of 9.0.\nAdd the reagents into an empty 5 mL vial in the following order: i) COL1 stock, ii) DI water, iii) 10x PBS, iv) 0.1 M NaOH.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a displacement pipette to handle the COL1 solution. Significant sample loss may occur if a regular pipette is used, leading to fluctuations in final solution concentration.\nRaise the pH of the solution to the desired pH (typically between 7-9).\nInjecting the COL1 solution\n\t\nPlace a syringe pump, a chilled sterile syringe, chilled neutralized COL1 solution, and a sterile 20 G 90˚ angle tip Luer lock needle into a biosafety cabinet. Load the COL1 solution into the syringe, taking care to avoid introducing bubbles.\nAttach the 90˚ 20 G needle tip to the syringe, load the syringe into the syringe pump, needle facing down, and prime the needle with the COL1 solution.\nSet the syringe pump to the required flow rate, between 50-2,000 µL/min.",
    "Place prepared PDMS channels (section 1) on a lab jack and level with the needle.\nInsert the needle into the inlet port of the PDMS channel (wide side). Inject the channel until a ~30 µL drop of COL1 collects on the outlet side.\nLower the lab jack and gently separate the needle from the newly filled channel.\nRepeat steps 2.2.5-2.2.9 until all channels have been filled with COL1 solution.\nLoad the filled channels into the Petri dishes alongside a clean, lint-free wipe saturated with DI water to prevent dehydration of the newly formed COL1 gel.\nCover the Petri dish and place the loaded channels in the incubator (37 ˚C, 95% humidity) for 2 h before the peel-off step.\nPeel off and media equilibration\n\t\nExpose the polymerized COL1 gel by lifting off the PDMS cover using tweezers. The BSA treatment prevents COL1 from attaching to the cover.\nAdd 650 µL of EGM to the well.\nLeave the devices in the incubator (37 ˚C, 95% humidity) for a minimum of 4 h to equilibrate the gel and media. Replace the media before seeding with cells\nSeeding cells\n\t\nPlace warm 0.25% trypsin and culture media along with the required number of 5 mL and 10 mL pipettes in the biosafety cabinet.\nCulture human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to 80% confluency in endothelial growth media (EGM) at 37 ˚C, in 95% humidity. Place the tissue culture flask containing HUVECs in the BSC after checking confluency under a microscope.\nDiscard the media in the T25 flask and wash the cells 2x with 1x PBS. Add 1 mL of Trypsin to the flask and place it in the incubator (37 ˚C, 95% humidity) for 3 min.",
    "Check the flask under the microscope after 3 min to ensure that the cells are completely detached from the surface.\nAdd 3 mL of EGM (with serum) to the flask to neutralize the trypsin. Next, transfer the cell solution using a 5 mL pipette into a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the conical tube containing cells at 150 x g for 5 min.\nPlace the conical tube in the biosafety cabinet and discard the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of fresh culture media.\nAdd and mix 15 µL of trypan blue and 15 µL of the resuspended cell solution in a 1 mL conical tube.\nInject trypan blue and cell solution on both sides of a cell counting slide and insert the slide into a cell counting device.\nDilute the cell solution in endothelial growth media to the required concentration based on the cell concentration obtained from the cell counting device.\n\t\tNOTE: A T25 flask of HUVECs at 80% confluency will yield ~750,000 cells·ml−1 if diluted in 1 mL of media. The volume of the cell suspension to be seeded is calculated as area of the culture surface × cell density/concentration of cell suspension. Example: To seed 20,000 cells·cm−2 in the 35 mm x 15 mm well, one will need ~140 µL of the cell suspension.\nAspirate the media on the engineered COL1 matrix.\nAdd the required volume of the cell solution onto the COL1 substrate and let the cells settle for a minimum of 4 h before imaging.\nLabeling the cell nucleus and cytoskeleton\n\t\nAspirate the media from the cells and wash 3x with 1x PBS, 500 µL in each wash. Cover the cell layer with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT.",
    "Aspirate the paraformaldehyde and wash with 1x PBS Tween-20 for 5 min.\nPermeabilize the cell membrane using 500 µL of 0.1% Triton-X solution in PBS for 15 min. Wash with 1x PBS Tween-20 for 5 min.\nBlock the non-specific binding sites with 500 µL of 4% BSA in PBS for 30 min at RT.\nDilute the phalloidin-actin fluorescent label solution in 4% BSA (1 µL of stock in 400 µL of BSA).\nAspirate the BSA solution, add the phalloidin solution to the cells, and wait for 30 min at RT.\nDilute the nuclear stain in 4% BSA (1 µL in 500 µL), aspirate the phalloidin, add the working nuclear stain solution, and wait for 15 min at RT.\nAspirate the nuclear stain working solution, wash with PBS Tween-20 3x for 5 min each, and replace with 1x PBS before imaging.\nImage using an epifluorescent microscope using the FITC channel (ex 491 nm/em 516 nm) and DAPI channel (ex 360 nm/em 460 nm) with a 40x lens. Image the collagen using a laser scanning confocal in the reflectance mode using the 488 nm laser line (15% power) and 40x water-immersion objective.\nSubscription Required.
