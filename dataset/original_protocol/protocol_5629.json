    "Duration: The protocol can be performed comfortably in 4 days (including RNA isolation from bacteria) as follows: Steps A1-A16 on day 1, A17-C5 on day 2, D1-E12 on day 3, and E13 onwards on day 4. The flowchart below summarizes the major steps in the protocol (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180212/20180212180751_4400.jpgFigure 1. The flowchart of the major steps in the protocolRNA isolation from bacteria: RNA extraction methods will depend on the bacteria under study. The extraction method must avoid any column-based or size-dependent purification steps that could lead to preferential loss of small RNAs. We follow the manufacturer’s instructions provided with Trizol reagent for our model system Marinomonas mediterranea, a gamma-proteobacterium (like E. coli). We use no more than 200-500 μl of saturated M. mediterranea culture in Marine Broth 2216 for RNA isolation.Sequencing library preparation: Small RNA isolation by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)Assemble a pre-cast Novex 6% TBE-Urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel in the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis System. Note: Remember to remove the gel comb and the green tape at the bottom of the gel cassette before assembling the electrophoresis cell.Fill the inside and outside chambers with 1x TBE running buffer, and pre-run the gel at 180 V for at least 30 min.Prepare samples of at least 5-10 μg total intact RNA and 0.1 μg Ultra Low Range DNA ladder in 2x formamide gel loading dye at a final concentration of 1x. We suggest keeping the total volume of each sample < 15 μl.Denature the samples and ladder by heating in a thermocycler with a pre-heated lid at 94 °C for 5 min, then immediately place in an ice-water slurry.While the samples are denaturing, thoroughly flush urea out of each gel well using a 100 μl pipette with the running buffer from the inner chamber several times.",
    "Load samples carefully with gel-loading pipette tips.Note: Leave 1-2 lanes between different RNA samples to reduce the amount of cross-contamination between experiments. We recommend including no more than 4-5 RNA samples (and one lane for the approximate sizing ladder) in a 10-lane gel.Run at 180 V until the bromophenol blue dye front (bottom band ~25 nt) reaches close to the end of the gel (about 35 min).While the gel is running, prepare gel elution tubes by making a small cross-shaped incision at the bottom of a 0.6 ml tube with a clean razor blade (see diagram for details) and placing it inside a 1.5 ml siliconized centrifuge tube. Do not remove the caps of either the 0.6 ml or 1.5 ml tubes (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180212/20180212181424_0668.jpgFigure 2. Longitudinal and transverse view of 0.6 ml tube for pulverizing polyacrylamide gel fragments. A cross-shaped incision is made at the bottom of 0.6 ml centrifuge tube using a clean razor blade. The polyacrylamide gel fragment is pulverized as it is forced through the incision and into a 1.5 ml siliconized centrifuge tube by centrifugation.Note: Use of siliconized tubes is critical to avoid the loss of RNA due to non-specific binding to tube walls.Carefully disassemble the cassette and remove the gel. Stain with SYBR Gold diluted 1:5,000 in 1x TBE running buffer.Note: We typically use 3 μl of SYBR Gold in 15 ml running buffer and stain on a slowly rocking nutator in a small plastic dish for about 5 min at room temperature. Wear appropriate protective equipment to prevent exposure to SYBR Gold, and also to prevent contamination of samples with extraneous biological material.Transfer the gel onto a clear plastic film and place on a UV transilluminator (set at 365 nm wavelength).",
    "Carefully excise out gel fragments for each sample from the 25-nt marker upto the 75-nt marker, which should be just below a bright band corresponding to cellular tRNAs (Figure 3).Note: For a non-degraded RNA sample, there will most likely be no visible RNA in the excised gel fragment. We often include a small portion of the lowest visible tRNA band to serve as a carrier in subsequent steps. Intact tRNAs typically do not reverse transcribe efficiently and should not result in overwhelming contamination in the final dataset.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180212/20180212181517_2432.jpgFigure 3. Small RNA size selection. A. Four intact total RNA samples (6% denaturing TBE-Urea PAGE). Two biological replicates for each experiment were run side-by-side, with approximate DNA sizing ladders. Images cropped and brightness/contrast adjusted in Microsoft Word. B. Size selection of 25- to 75-nt RNAs, including lowest tRNA band. The Invitrogen 10 bp DNA ladder was used in this gel but has since been discontinued by the manufacturer.Place each gel fragment in a separate elution tube.Centrifuge each elution tube at 20,000 x g at room temperature in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 1-3 min to force the gel fragment through the incision in the 0.6 ml tube and into the 1.5 ml siliconized tube. Carefully remove any leftover gel pieces in the 0.6 ml tube with a clean pipette tip, and place in the corresponding 1.5 ml siliconized tube. Discard the 0.6 ml tube.Add 300 μl of polyacrylamide gel elution buffer (see Recipes) into each 1.5 ml siliconized tube containing pulverized gel fragments, and vortex vigorously to make a uniform slurry.Place the tubes at -80 °C to freeze, then in a 37 °C water bath for 2 min to thaw. Vortex vigorously, and then repeat this step 2-3 times.",
    "Place the samples on ice for 1 min to cool, then incubate at 4 °C with shaking in a rotisserie tube rotator overnight to elute RNA from gel fragments.Centrifuge briefly to collect gel slurry at the bottom of the tube.Prepare filtration tubes by placing 0.45 μm sterile cellulose acetate filters in new 1.5 ml siliconized tubes.Widen the bore of 1,000 μl pipette tips using clean scissors, and transfer gel slurry to the filtration tubes.Collect RNA eluate by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature, discard the filters, and add (in order) 1 μl (20 mg/ml) glycogen and 1 ml 100% ethanol to each sample.Precipitate nucleic acids by placing the tubes at -80 °C for 30 min.Centrifuge at 20,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 min, and discard the ethanol while taking care not to dislodge the pellet.Wash with 1 ml freshly prepared 70% ethanol, taking care to flush out the cap by inverting several times.Note: It is not necessary to vortex aggressively at this step. Vortexing can be helpful in dislodging the pellet, but excessive agitation, as well as use of more concentrated ethanol for washing will lead to pellet fragmentation and reduction in yield.Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature to collect the pellet, pour off the ethanol and repeat the wash.Centrifuge briefly at room temperature to collect residual ethanol after the second wash step is complete. Remove remaining ethanol using a 10 μl pipette, taking care not to touch the pellet. Air dry for 3 min.Note: After removing residual ethanol with a pipette, 3 min is sufficient to dry the pellet. We typically dry under a flame to prevent dust from accidentally settling in the tubes.Resuspend pellet in 17 μl RNase-free water at room temperature.",
    "Note: The added glycogen from Step A20 should result in a clearly visible pellet that may become translucent upon drying. The pellet will be easy to resuspend provided it has not been over-dried. Polynucleotide kinase (PNK) treatmentDenature RNA at 90 °C for 1 min in a heated-lid thermocycler, then plunge in ice for 1 min.Note: We use the entire RNA sample from the previous step, and do not attempt to measure its concentration since the amount of RNA is often below the detection limit of commercial assay kits.To 17 μl of the RNA sample, add (in order) 2 μl 10x PNK buffer and 1 μl PNK enzyme, and mix well by pipetting.Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.Add (in order) 80 μl RNase-free water, 50 μl (7.5 M) ammonium acetate, and 500 μl 100% ethanol.Precipitate RNA as in Steps A21-A25.Resuspend pellet in 4.5 μl RNase-free water at room temperature.Note: The added glycogen from Step A20 should result in a clearly visible pellet that may become translucent upon drying. The pellet will be easy to resuspend provided it has not been over-dried.3’ adapter ligation (without ATP)Pre-mix equal volumes of 5x adenylation buffer (see Recipes) and 50% PEG 8000 to make 4 μl mixture per sample (+ 20% extra to account for pipetting error). Transfer RNA samples to 0.2 ml PCR tubes, and add 4 μl of the mixture to each RNA sample. Mix well by pipetting.Note: PEG 8000 is viscous and pre-mixing with 5x adenylation buffer helps to reduce viscosity and make dispensing to sample tubes easier. Mix by pipetting for as long as necessary until the solution appears uniform.Heat sample to 98 °C for 1 min, plunge in ice for 1 min, then place at room temperature for the next step.Add (in order) 0.",
    "5 μl (100 μM) pre-adenylated 3’ adapter oligo, and 1 μl T4 RNA ligase I. Mix well by pipetting.Note: We keep the pre-adenylated 3’ adapter oligo at -80 °C and thaw on ice before use.Incubate in a thermocycler at 22 °C for 6 h. The reaction can be stored at 4 °C if performing this step overnight.Excess adapter digestionPre-mix 78 μl RNase-free water and 10 μl NEB buffer 2 for each sample.Incubate RNA samples at 95 °C for 1 min, allow to cool and then add 88 μl of buffer mixture.Add 1 μl 5’ deadenylase, mix, and incubate at 30 °C in a thermocycler for 30 min.Add 1 μl RecJf, mix, and incubate at 37 °C in a thermocycler for 30 min.Note: The 5’ deadenylase removes the /5rApp/ group from the free 5’ ends of un-ligated pre-adenylated adapters, thereby exposing the excess adapter molecules to digestion by the single-stranded-DNA-specific 5’ → 3’ exonuclease RecJf.During the digestion step, pre-spin a heavy phaselock gel tube for each sample at 16,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature.Add 100 μl RNase-free water to each RNA sample, mix well, and transfer to a pre-spun phaselock tube.Add 200 μl acid-phenol:chloroform to each sample and mix by shaking vigorously by hand.Centrifuge at 16,000 x g at room temperature for 5 min.Add 200 μl chloroform to each sample in the same tube and mix gently by inversion.Centrifuge at 16,000 x g at room temperature for 5 min. Transfer the aqueous phase to a new 1.5 ml siliconized tube, and add (in order) 0.5 μl (20 mg/ml) glycogen, 100 μl (7.5 M) ammonium acetate and 1 ml 100% ethanol to each sample.Precipitate RNA as in Steps A21-A25.Resuspend pellet in 5.75 μl RNase-free water at room temperature.",
    "Note: The added glycogen from Step D11 should result in a clearly visible pellet that may become translucent upon drying. The pellet will be easy to resuspend provided it has not been over-dried.Reverse-transcriptionPrepare a reverse-transcription master mix, with 2 μl 5x First-strand buffer, 1 μl (0.1 M) dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μl (10 mM) dNTPs for each RNA sample (+ 20% extra to account for pipetting error).Transfer RNA samples to 0.2 ml PCR tubes, and add 0.25 μl (100 μM) reverse-transcription primer to each tube.Heat samples to 90 °C for 1 min, then plunge on ice for 1 min.Add 3.5 μl of reverse-transcription master mix to each sample.Note: Also maintain a ‘no-template’ control, which will allow for visualization of the reverse-transcription primer during the subsequent gel purification step.Add 0.5 μl SuperScript II reverse transcriptase to each reaction and mix well by pipetting.Incubate at 42 °C for 30 min in a heated-lid thermocycler to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA).During this incubation step, set up and pre-run a Novex 10% TBE-Urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel in the XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis System at 180 V for at least 30 min as described in Steps A1-A2.Add 2 μl (1 N) sodium hydroxide to each reaction.Incubate at 70 °C for 15 min in a heated-lid thermocycler to hydrolyze RNA.Add 12 μl 2x formamide gel loading dye (i.e., at a final concentration of 1x) to each sample.Prepare 0.1 μg of Ultra Low Range DNA ladder in 2x formamide gel loading dye at a final concentration of 1x.Denature and run cDNA on pre-run gels as in Steps A4-A25, with the following modifications:In Step A7, run the gel until the Xylene Cyanol dye front (top band ~55 nt) reaches close to the bottom of the gel (about 45-60 min).",
    "In Step A11, excise gel fragments in the 100- to 160-nt range (processed CRISPR RNAs are generally in the ~50-100-nt range and the reverse transcription primer adds ~65-nt to the size of the desired small RNAs). Use the no-template control as a visual guide during gel excision, and avoid the bright bands formed in this lane (typically no higher than 90-nt) (Figure 4). In step A16, cDNA elution should be carried out at room temperature.Resuspend the cDNA pellet in 17 μl water. Reserve half the sample and store at -20 °C as a backup.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180212/20180212182043_3479.jpgFigure 4. Purification of cDNA following reverse transcription. A. Four cDNA sample (10% denaturing TBE-Urea PAGE). The first lane is the no-template control, followed by an approximate DNA sizing ladder. Brightness/contrast adjusted in Microsoft Word. B. Size selection of 100- to 160-nt cDNAs, avoiding bright high-molecular-weight bands. The Invitrogen 10 bp DNA ladder was used in this gel but has since been discontinued by the manufacturer.cDNA circularizationAdd 1 μl 10x circLigase reaction buffer, 0.5 μl (1 mM) ATP, and 0.5 μl (50 mM) manganese chloride solution to 8 μl cDNA in 0.2 ml PCR tubes.Add 0.5 μl circLigase enzyme. Mix well by pipetting.Incubate at 60 °C for 75 min in a heated-lid thermocycler.While the circularization reaction is proceeding, prepare enough 3-3.5% agarose gels (in 1x TAE with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide) to accommodate 5 PCR lanes plus 1 DNA sizing ladder per cDNA sample.Note: We use the 1.5 mm thick 12-well combs supplied with Owl EasyCast B2 gel electrophoresis systems to make enough lanes for two cDNA samples.Stop the reaction by heating to 80 °C for 15 min. Use this circularized cDNA (ccDNA) sample directly as a template for PCR.",
    "PCR amplification and purification of sequencing librariesPrepare a PCR mix with 100 μl 2x Phusion Master Mix, 1 μl (100 μM) Universal PCR primer, and 100 μl water for each cDNA sample.Add 200 μl PCR mix to 5 μl ccDNA from Step F5. Add 1 μl of a different indexing primer for each sample.Split each reaction mixture into 5 separate 0.2 ml PCR tubes (40 μl each).Perform a PCR titration for each ccDNA sample by running each sub-reaction for a different number of cycles according to the following program:98 °C for 30 secN cycles of 98 °C for 10 sec60 °C for 10 sec72 °C for 10 sechold at 10 °CNote: We typically perform titrations with N = 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 cycles for each ccDNA sample.Add 8 μl of 6x DNA gel loading dye to each reaction. Load all 5 titrations for each sample side-by-side on the agarose gel. We suggest using the Ultra Low Range DNA ladder (~0.5 μg/lane) to demarcate sets of titrations of different ccDNA samples.Run the gel in agarose gel running buffer (1x TAE with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide) at 3.6-3.7 V/cm for 1-2 h.Place the gels on a UV transilluminator (set at 365 nm wavelength). Choose the appropriate number of PCR cycles for each ccDNA sample by visually assessing the PCR titration (see Note below) and excise a gel slice containing the PCR amplicon corresponding to the size of the desired product using a 100-1,000 μl pipette fitted with gel excision tips. Expel each gel slice into a separate 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.Note: A bright band corresponding to the ‘empty’ circularized ccDNA product (i.e., without a small RNA insert) should be visible in each lane. This may appear as a doublet as the number of PCR cycles (N) is increased.",
    "For most small RNA sequencing applications, the desired product will be ~50 bp above this bright band/doublet. For CRISPR RNA sequencing, we rarely ever see a visible smear at this size range, and cut ‘blindly’ using the DNA ladder and the location of the bright band/doublet (~125 bp) as a visual guide. We typically aim for the highest number of PCR cycles for each ccDNA sample while still safely avoiding the upward-smear from the bright ~125 bp band/doublet (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180212/20180212182257_5021.jpgFigure 5. Library preparation by ‘blind’ gel excision. A. PCR titrations of amplified sequencing libraries for two ccDNA samples (3-3.5% native agarose gel electrophoresis). 5 titrations for each ccDNA sample were run side-by-side along with a DNA sizing ladder. Brightness/contrast adjusted in Microsoft Word. B. Size selection of DNA at the 175 bp marker, above the bright band/doublet formed by amplification from empty ccDNA (i.e., without a small RNA insert). The Invitrogen 25 bp DNA ladder was used in this gel but has since been discontinued by the manufacturer.Extract DNA from the gel slices according to manufacturer’s instructions using the QIAGEN MinElute Gel Extraction kit.Quantify each purified DNA sample according to manufacturer’s instructions using the high-sensitivity double stranded DNA quantification kit accompanying the Qubit fluorometer. Calculate the approximate concentration of each sample according to the following formula:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180212/20180212182337_9838.jpgPool the samples in equimolar amounts. The pooled library can be sequenced according to the specifications of your Illumina high-throughput sequencing services provider. We typically use the single-read configuration for 80 cycles for small RNA sequencing applications. For assessing pre-crRNA processing in Marinomonas mediterranea, we sequence no more than 1 million reads per sample, but this will depend on the level of expression of pre-crRNA in the species of interest."
