    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol describes HyPro labeling of the 45S and NEAT1 RNAs in fixed and permeabilized HeLa cells followed by fluorescence imaging of proximity-labeled foci (HyPro-FISH) or purification of biotinylated proteins and RNAs for mass-spectrometry and RNA-seq (HyPro-MS and HyPro-seq). We have also used this protocol to analyze the 45S RNA in human iPS cells, NEAT1 in ARPE-19 cells and PNCTR in HeLa cells.\nHybridization and proximity labeling\nTiming: 3 days\nFor HyPro-FISH, grow cells in 12-well plates on 18-mm round coverslips.\nTo isolate HyPro-labeled proteins and RNAs, use the 10-cm dish format.\nSeed HeLa cells the day before fixation/permeabilization to obtain 80%–90% confluent cultures on the day of experiment.\nFor HyPro-FISH, seed ∼1.5 × 105 HeLa cells per well of a 12-well plate containing 18 mm round coverslips in 1 mL of DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1×PenStrep.\nTo isolate HyPro-labeled proteins and RNAs, seed ∼0.6 × 106 HeLa cells per 10-cm dish in 10 mL of DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1×PenStrep.\nNote: Optimization of cell seeding density may be needed if a different cell line is used.\nWash the cells once with 1×PBS (1 mL/well for the 12-well format; 5 mL per 10-cm dish).\nFix with freshly prepared 0.5 mg/mL DSP solution for 30–45 min at 20°C–24°C (1 mL/well or 5 mL/dish). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCritical: The working solution of DSP must be prepared immediately before the fixation and be completely transparent.\nNote: DSP solution may form some visible precipitation by the end of the 30–45-min incubation. However, if the solution was initially transparent, this does not seem to compromise the efficiency of cell fixation.\nWash 3 times with 1×PBS supplemented with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 min each wash (1 mL/well or 5 mL/dish)",
    "Permeabilize the cells with 70% ethanol for 1 h at 20°C–24°C or overnight (∼16 h) at 4°C (1 mL/well or 5 mL/dish).\nPause point: In case of HyPro-FISH, fixed and permeabilized cells can be kept in 70% ethanol for about a week at 4°C.\nRinse the cells with 2×SSC and 10% formamide for 1–2 min (1 mL/well or 5 mL/dish).\nDilute digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes in the hybridization buffer.\nCritical: Before attempting HyPro-MS and HyPro-seq, test a range of probe concentrations by HyPro-FISH. We recommend using the minimum concentration producing a robust HyPro-FISH signal (e.g. 5 nM for 45S rRNA and 25 nM for NEAT1 RNA).\nFor coverslips, use the hybridization procedure described for RNA-FISH above.\nFor 10-cm dishes, cover the cell monolayer with 5 mL of diluted probe.\nIncubate the samples in a humidified chamber and at 37°C overnight (∼16 h).\nNote: it is possible that the hybridization conditions (e.g. the temperature and the concentration of formamide) will have to be optimized for RNA targets with unusually high or unusually low GC content.\nNext day, wash the cells with 2×SSC and 10% formamide for 30 min at 37°C (1 mL/well or 5 mL/dish).\nWash with 1×SSC for 15 min at 20°C–24°C (1 mL/well or 5 mL/dish).\nBlock with 4×SSC, 0.8% BSA and 0.1 units/μL RNase inhibitor for 30 min at 20°C–24°C.\nIncubate with HyPro protein diluted to 2.7 ng/mL in 4×SSC, 0.8% BSA and 0.1 units/μL RNase inhibitor at 20°C–24°C for 1 h in a humidified chamber (1 mL/well or 5 mL/dish).\nWash at 20°C–24°C once with 4×SSC, once with 4×SSC and 0.1% Triton X-100, and once with 4×SSC, 10 min each wash (1 mL/well or 5 mL/dish).",
    "Incubate the cells in 1×PBS (experiment) or 1×PBS with 5.4 ng/mL HyPro protein (HyPro-infusion control) for 5 min at 20°C–24°C (0.4 mL/well or 4 mL/dish).\nAdd an equal volume of 1×PBS containing 1 mM biotin-phenol and 0.2 mM H2O2 and incubate for 1 min at 20°C–24°C. This means that the labeling reaction occurs in the presence of 0.5 mM biotin phenol and 0.1 mM H2O2 and that the HyPro-infusion control additionally contains 2.7 ng/mL HyPro protein.\nAspirate (the 12-well format) or decant (the 10-cm format) the labeling mixture.\nWash 3 times with the Quencher solution (1 mL/well or 5 mL/dish), 30 s–1 min each wash.\nCritical: To ascertain signal specificity, include no-probe and ideally scrambled-probe and HyPro-infusion controls.\nDetection of proximity-labeled foci by fluorescence microscopy (HyPro-FISH)\nTiming: 2 h\nThe subsequent steps differ depending on whether you plan to visualize the proximity biotinylation pattern by HyPro-FISH or isolate spatial neighbors of the RNA of interest for downstream analyses. For HyPro-FISH, follow steps 19–26. To isolate proximity-biotinylated proteins or/and RNA, proceed to step 27.\nRinse coverslips with 4×SSC.\nIncubate with Alexa Fluor 647 streptavidin (2.5 μg/mL final concentration) in 4×SSC, 0.8% BSA, and 0.1 units/μL RNase inhibitor in a humidified chamber at 20°C–24°C for 1 h in the dark.\nWash at 20°C–24°C once with 4×SSC, once with 4×SSC and 0.1% Triton X-100 and once with 4×SSC, 10 min, 1 mL each wash.\nRinse with 1×PBS for 1 min.\nCounterstain with DAPI (0.5 μg/mL) in 1× PBS for 3 min and wash briefly with 1×PBS.\nMount on a clean glass slide with ProLong Gold Antifade mountant avoiding air bubbles and cure for 16–24 h at 20°C–24°C in the dark.\nSeal glass coverslips with transparent nail polish.\nVisualize the signal using a widefield epifluorescence microscope (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).

    "Figure 4. Typical HyPro-FISH results\nHyPro-FISH analyses were carried out in DSP-fixed and EtOH-permeabilized HeLa cells using 5 nM of 45S-specific (top row), 5 nM of scrambled 45S (second from the top row), or 25 nM of NEAT1-specific probe sets (middle row) (see Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1399-Mmc1.xlsx] for probe sequences). Hybridizations in the second from the bottom and the bottom rows were carried out without probes. Cells in the bottom row were additionally infused with diluted HyPro enzymes immediately before the proximity biotinylation step. Scale bars, 10 μm.\nCritical: test a range of digoxigenin probe concentrations for newly designed and labeled probe sets.\nNote: we use 3% of the maximal light source intensity and 150 ms exposure time for both 45S and NEAT1 HyPro-FISH.\nCell lysis and decrosslinking\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following four steps are common for both protein and RNA isolation parts of the protocol.\nAspirate the solution and lyse cells directly in the 10-cm dish with 600 μL High-SDS RIPA buffer. Spread the buffer over the entire dish and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nScrape the lysed material off the plate and incubate for 10 min on ice.\nSplit the lysate into ≤300-μL aliquots in 1.5-mL microfuge tubes and sonicate using a Bioruptor (Diagenode) set on “high”, for 7 cycles of 30 s ON/30 s OFF.\nNote: these settings may need to be modified for a different cell line or/and sonicator model.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min to reverse DSP crosslinks.\nIsolation of biotinylated proteins\nTiming: 2 days\nFollow this part of the protocol to capture proximity-biotinylated proteins for subsequent immunoblotting and label-free mass-spectrometry analyses. To purify biotinylated RNAs, proceed to step 50.\nSpin decrosslinked lysate at 15,000×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new tube.",

However, in our experience, biotin can be omitted from the elution buffer with no detectable decrease in elution efficiency.\nAdd 15 μL of 4×LDS sample buffer supplemented with 50 mM DTT to the beads and incubate at 70°C for 10 min.\nVortex, chill on ice, and briefly spin down the samples to collect the condensation. Pellet the beads using a DynaMag™-2 magnet and collect the supernatant for immunoblot analysis.",
    "Separate biotinylated proteins by SDS-PAGE and transfer them to a nitrocellulose membrane using a preferred electrotransfer method (we use Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system from Bio-Rad), block the membrane with 3% BSA in 1×TBS and 0.1% Tween-20 for 30–60 min at 20°C–24°C or overnight (∼16 h) at 4°C.\nIncubate with streptavidin-HRP (1:20,000 in 1×TBS and 0.1% Tween-20) for 60 min at 20°C–24°C or overnight (∼16 h) at 4°C.\nNote: we prefer overnight 4°C incubations with streptavidin-HRP since they tend to produce a better signal-to-noise ratio.\nWash four times with 1×TBS and 0.1% Tween-20 for 5 min at 20°C–24°C and visualize the bands using enhanced chemiluminescence (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).

Values in the HyPro infusion samples (HyPro inf.) are set to 1. The data were compared by a two-tailed t test assuming unequal variances.\n(E) A dot blot assay detects biotinylated RNA species in both total and streptavidin bead pull-down fractions from 45S- and NEAT1-labeled and HyPro-infused samples, but not from a no-probe control.\nFollow steps 43–49 to prepare mass-spectrometry samples.\nPellet the beads, remove the supernatant and wash the beads three times with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate.",
