    "NOTE: For embryo stages, utilize the Hamburger and Hamilton12 (HH) staging table.\n1. Embryo Incubation\nIncubate fertilized chicken eggs in a sterile, temperature-controlled incubator at 37 °C ± 1 °C and ~40% humidity.\nTurn the eggs 1x per day and allow them to incubate to HH34 (8 days post-fertilization).\n2. Preparation and Sterilization of the Materials\nFor 12 embryos, autoclave 2 L of distilled water, 1 L of 0.85% chick saline, 12 glass pipettes, 1 box of paper tissue, 24 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm squares of semi-porous filter paper, and 24 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm squares of steel wire mesh with the edges curved downwards. To sterilize the materials, autoclave them at 121 °C for at least 15 min.\n\tNOTE: The autoclaving of the materials can be done in advance.\nSterilize the incubator with 70% ethanol by wiping the sides, shelves, and door. Place 2 plastic containers containing autoclaved distilled water inside the incubator to maintain humidity. Prewarm the culture incubator to 37 °C ± 1 °C and ~40% humidity. Ensure the incubator is completely dark; if the door is transparent, cover it with tinfoil.\nPrewarm 100 mL of nutrient medium and 1 mL of penicillin by placing them in the culture incubator.\nCover the workspace with a paper towel and sterilize the bench by spraying it with 70% ethanol. Sterilize 2 pairs of forceps, dissection scissors, a razor blade, and a plastic spoon with 70% ethanol in a similar manner.\nPlace 12 sterile 100 mm Petri dishes and 24 sterile 35 mm Petri dishes on the bench for use. Ensure the dishes remain in a sterile bag until use.\n3. Embryo Preparation",
    "NOTE: From this point onwards, wear a protective dust face mask to avoid contaminating the cultures. A bacterial or fungal infection will ruin the culture and there is a risk of it spreading quickly to all cultures in the incubator.\nCrack open the egg and transfer the embryo to a 100 mm Petri dish containing 0.85% chick saline. Stage the embryo according to the anatomical features described in the Hamburger and Hamilton staging guidelines12 and confirm the embryo is at HH34.\nCut the neck and then bisect the head of the embryo at the midline using a sterilized razor blade. Using sterile forceps, remove the brain. Leave the beak intact.\n4. Culture Setup\nPlace 2 of the 35 mm Petri dishes inside one 100 mm Petri dish.\nPlace a steel wire mesh inside each 35 mm Petri dish.\nUsing forceps, transfer 1 of the bisected heads to a piece of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm semi-porous filter paper with the eye facing up. Ensure the tissue is secure and does not slip off by tilting it slightly.\nUsing forceps, carefully place the eye tissue and the filter paper on top of the steel wire mesh in 1 of the 35 mm Petri dishes, creating a raised stage with the eye tissue on top.\nRepeat steps 4.3 and 4.4 with the other half head.\nUsing a sterile glass pipette, carefully add nutrient medium directly into each 35 mm Petri dish until it reaches the level of the filter paper. Do not submerge the half head in the nutrient medium.\nAdd 50 µL of 10,000 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin to the nutrient medium in each Petri dish.\nFold a piece of tissue paper into a small square and place it inside the 100 mm Petri dish. Moisten it with autoclaved distilled water.",
    "Place the culture dish into the sterile, dark incubator at 37 °C ± 1 °C and ~40% humidity for up to 4 days.\nRepeat steps 3 and 4 for each embryo.\n\tNOTE: The number of embryos needed will depend on the specific experiment; here, we describe the protocol for 12 embryos.\n5. Culture Maintenance\nOnce per day, top up the plastic containers in the incubator with fresh, autoclaved distilled water.\nDaily check all cultures for bacterial or fungal infections. Cultures that have disintegrated or in which the medium has changed color are infected. Discard all cultures that are infected.\n6. Fixation\nFollowing culturing, remove all dishes from the incubator.\nUsing a pair of forceps, gently remove the eye from the filter paper, taking care not to tear the tissue.\nFix the eye tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C or in 10% neutral-buffered formalin overnight at room temperature.\nStore the tissue at 4 °C in 1x phosphate-buffered saline.\nSubscription Required.
