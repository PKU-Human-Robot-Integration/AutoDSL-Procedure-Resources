    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAcute slice preparation\nTiming: 20 min\nThis step describes the preparation of acute hippocampal slices to be used for electrophysiological recordings and subsequent histological processing.\nCritical: Prior to commencement of any rodent work, ensure that all legal aspects pertaining to the use of animals in scientific research have been obtained from both institutional and regional organizations.\nNote: All work outlined in this protocol has been performed in line with UK Home Office guidelines (ASPA 2013) and The University of Edinburgh Ethical Board.\nDissect brain:\nAnesthetize mouse or rat by placing in an anesthetic chamber containing suitable concentration of a volatile anesthetic (e.g., isoflurane).\nNote: We use ∼1 mL of isoflurane in a 5 L anesthetic chamber, however the exact method and anesthetic agent used should be in line with local guidelines.\nConfirm deep anesthesia, reduction of breathing, and absence of reflexes.\nDecapitate rodent using a pair of sharp scissors or guillotine.\nRapidly remove skull, using a pair of fine scissors.\nUsing curved, blunt-tip forceps to remove the skull from between bregma and the zygomatic arch.\nUsing a small spatula, gently separate the brain from the skull, taking care to sever the cranial nerves. Roll brain into small beaker of sucrose-ASCF (Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] step 2c.)\nNote: All tools and equipment required for removal of the brain and preparation for slicing can be found in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nCritical: The dissection of the brain following decapitation should ideally take <30 s to ensure high quality brain slices.\nPrepare horizontal brain slices of the hippocampus:\nTransfer brain from small beaker to glass Petri dish, lined with disc of filter paper.\nUsing a scalpel, remove cerebellum and frontal third of brain.",
    "Apply a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue (Superglue) to slicing stage of vibratome. Use probe to spread glue to form a thin film.\nPlace brain, ventral surface down onto the glue.\nUsing a wide-mouth Pasteur pipette, apply a few drops of sucrose-ACSF to the brain to wash excess glue away from brain block.\nPlace slicing stage in vibratome and flood slicing chamber with remaining ice-cold sucrose-ACSF. Take care to position the brain so that the entorhinal cortices are positioned closest to the vibratome blade. Place a carbogen line in the slicing chamber (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/467-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Obtaining acute hippocampal slices\n(A) Brain positioned on the vibratome stage.\n(B) Vibratome chamber filled with carbogenated sucrose-ACSF.\n(C) Cutting horizontal slices containing the hippocampus.\n(D) Trimmed slices in the holding chamber.\nMove blade to brain surface, and then cut 400 μm thick horizontal slices containing the hippocampus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nNote: Slices tend to have better preservation of neuronal structure if they are cut slowly. Ideally cut slices at 0.05–0.1 mm/s forward blade movement, with a horizontal blade oscillation of 1–1.5 mm.\nNote: A scalpel blade or a bent hypodermic needle can be used to trim the slices and separate the slices from each hemisphere before transferring into the holding chamber.\nNote: From a P28–35 mice it should be possible to obtain 8 slices (4 per hemisphere) containing the ventromedial portion of the hippocampus. For an equivalent age of rat, approximately 10–12 slices of the ventromedial hippocampus can be obtained.\nTransfer slices to a submerged holding chamber filled with carbogenated sucrose-ACSF pre-warmed to 35°C and recover for 30 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nFollowing recovery, transfer the holding chamber to the lab bench at 20°C ± 2°C (room temperature) until the slices are required for recording.",
    "Critical: Keep solutions bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 at all times to allow a sufficient partial pressure of O2 to build up in solution to supply brain tissue and preserve cell viability.\nRepeated whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with dye filling\nTiming: 1–4 h\nThis step allows for assessment of cellular physiology of hippocampal neurons both under control conditions and following a prolonged depolarization or osmotic controls within the same cell. Specific aspects of performing the whole-cell patch-clamp technique have been described previously (Booker et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], Neher and Sakmann, 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nTransfer hippocampal slice to the recording chamber:\nTurn off inflow and outflow of recording ACSF.\nUsing a wide-mouth Pasteur pipette transfer a brain slice from the holding chamber to the slice chamber.\nTake care to ensure that the dorsal surface is kept upwards.\nPlace slice weight over slice, ensuring that anchor wires do not overlay the CA1 region of the hippocampus.\nRestart recording ACSF flow. ACSF flow rate should be approx. 4–6 mL/min and should not be recirculated.\nNote: It may be helpful to modify the slice weight to give a large gap between anchor wires to prevent obfuscation of the CA1 region.\nUnder low magnification (10× objective) identify str. pyramidale of CA1 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/467-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Placement of slice in chamber, recording and dye filling of CA1 pyramidal cells\n(A and B) (A) low power overview of the hippocampus under infrared differential inference contrast (IR-DIC) microscopy, with recording site of (B) indicated (black box). Hippocampal subregions (white text), layers (black text), and the hippocampal fissure (dashed gray line) are indicated for reference. Scale bar: 200 μm. (B) High-power (40×) IR-DIC image of a CA1 pyramidal cell with a patch pipette placed on the cell body. Scale bar: 20 μm.",
    "(C) Epifluorescent image of the same neuron, before breaking in to whole-cell configuration. Note the absence of labeling in the cell body. Scale bar: 20 μm.\n(D) The same cell, but now in whole-cell configuration and having had filled for 5 min. Scale bar: 20 μm.\n(E) Fluorescent identification of the same cell after 3 h incubation in 15 mM KCl. Scale bar: 20 μm.\n(F) Whole-cell patch-clamp recording from the same cell under IR-DIC optics. Scale bar: 20 μm.\nExchange objective lens to high magnification (40× objective) and identify healthy region of pyramidal cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nHealthy CA1 pyramidal cells should have an ovoid cell body that is lightly contrasted with a halo of diffracted light around it. Any cells that are shriveled or shrunken are likely damaged or undergoing cell death.\nTypically identify a healthy looking cluster of cells that are located 50–100 μm below the slice surface.\nFill a pre-prepared patch pipette with intracellular solution and place on electrode holder.\nNote: Ensure that Ag wire of headstage amplifier is suitably coated with AgCl prior to any recording. Any chips in AgCl coating will lead to undue capacitive currents and offset errors during recording.\nApply positive pressure to patch pipette via pneumatic tube attached to electrode holder.\nMove patch pipette through recording ACSF and “park” the pipette just above the slice so that the cell to be recorded is located within the proximal region of the pipette tip (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nObtain a whole-cell patch-clamp recording from the first identified CA1 pyramidal cell, as previously described in detail (Booker et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).",
    "Critical: Recordings are excluded if resting membrane potential is more depolarized than −50 mV at time of entering whole-cell configuration, or if access resistance is greater than 30 MΩ or changes by more than 20% during the course of the recording.\nPerform intrinsic physiology analysis in current-clamp, including:\n30× −10 pA steps from the zero-current level (500 ms duration). This will assess resting membrane potential, input resistance, and membrane time constant.\nFrom a membrane potential of −70 mV, 3× families of hyper-to depolarizing current steps (−100 to +400 pA in 25 pA steps, 500 ms duration).\nConfirm spontaneous synaptic inputs by recording between 1 and 5 min of continuous recording at −70 mV voltage-clamp.\nOptional: Specific requirements of the recording may differ from this basic protocol. Depending on the hypothesis being tested, alternative whole-cell protocols may be required.\nOnce the recording is complete, confirm dye filling under epifluorescent imaging (typically 5–10 min of recording is sufficient to dye fill the somatodendritic regions) and perform an outside-out patch:\nClose IR-DIC light source and increase exposure time of digital camera (100–200 ms works well).\nMove filter turret to correct filter-set for fluorescent dye used.\nMove focus to identify filled cell (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nForm outside-out patch by slowly retracting the patch electrode under visual guidance.\nWhen access resistance begins to increase, slowly increase holding potential toward ∼−40 mV.\nNote: in performing outside out seals, access resistance is observed to smoothly increase from 5–30 MΩ to the 1–10 GΩ range. Increasing the holding potential, facilitates rupture of the retracted membrane.\nContinue retracting pipette until well clear of resealed cell.\nConfirm continued presence of filled cell both under IR-DIC and fluorescence.\nRepeat procedure for a further 2–4 cells:",
    "Make note of the order of which cells are recorded. This can be aided by drawing a map or taking images of the fluorescently labeled cells.\nOnce all recordings are complete and viability of resealing confirmed, place slice into appropriate treatment:\nStop inflow and outflow of recording ACSF.\nRemove slice weight.\nUsing the wide-mouth Pasteur pipette remove slice from the recording chamber and place in treatment chamber.\nNote time slice treatment was started.\nRinse transfer pipette with distilled water.\nNote: To account for time since slicing affecting the recording conditions for individual slices, recorded slices should be treated with different KCl or NaCl in a counterbalanced manner, i.e., alternating treatment within day and rotating of which treatment is used first between days.\nOptional: This protocol is based on our recent study (Booker et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) in which we employed prolonged depolarization of neurons by application of 15 mM KCl to examine cell excitability. Many other methods of modifying cell excitability could be employed (e.g., 4-aminopyridine, tetraethylammonium, tetrodotoxin, AP-5, CNQX, or bicuculline). The only requirement is that the agent used is easily and rapidly washed out of the tissue to allow comparison of physiological states under identical conditions.\nRepeat procedure for the remaining slices and alternate treatment conditions.\nPause Point: If break is required, following treatment of slice a pause can be taken.\nFollowing treatment, remove slice from treatment chamber and return to recording chamber:\nEnsure that the same side of slice is positioned up, to allow direct access to dye filled cells.\nPlace slice weight on slice, avoiding CA1 region of the slice.\nAllow 3–5 min for ACSF to fully wash out treatment ACSF.",
    "Note: If recirculation of ACSF is unavoidable, ensure that it is not recirculated while any residual treatment solution is washed through the perfusion tubing to prevent effected on cell excitability.\nUsing fluorescence microscopy, identify the previously filled cells, comparing to the map/images taken previously (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nPerform whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on dye filled cells, starting with first filled cell and moving through the selection that have survived treatment (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F).\nFor all cells, once recording has been completed, reseal the patch of membrane with outside-out patch formation as in step 12.\nNote: For consistency, the faster that these recording can be performed the more likely they reflect the state of the slice immediately after treatment. We aim to re-record all cells within ∼20 min of slice returning to normal ACSF. This may dictate how many cells are filled in the first phase of recording and the number of recording protocols used. Using a very brief recording protocol, and experienced electrophysiologist can re-record 3–4 cells within this time frame.\nOnce all filled cells have been recorded and resealed, slices should be fixed within 1 min of last recording. Once removed from the perfusing ACSF, the slice should be fixed immediately (less than 1 min):\nStart by turning off all inflow and outflow pumps.\nRemove the slice weight.\nCarefully extract the slice using the slice transfer pipette.\nPlace the slice into a fixation vessel (e.g., a multi-well plate or bijou bottle).\nFix slices using 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB:\nExtract excess recording ACSF using a Pasteur pipette.\nApply 2–3 mL of fresh 4% PFA in PB to the slice.\nSwirl or agitate the slice slightly to ensure that it is free-floating and not adhered to the wall of the vessel.",
    "Keep slices in 4% PFA at 20°C ± 2°C (room temperature) for 1 h.\nTransfer slices into PBS and store at 4°C until used for immunohistochemical labeling.\nCritical: Longer fixation time results in over-fixation of tissue and can compromise the quality of antibody labeling (See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/467-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Immunolabeling for the AIS from acute slices\n(A) AnkyrinG immunolabeling (AnkG, green pseudocolor) shown in comparison to NeuN labeling (blue pseudocolor) allows the visualization of AISs in a field of view including CA1 of the hippocampus. Scale bar: 20 μm.\n(B) Higher magnification view of a single AIS. Scale bar: 10 μm.\n(C) Poor quality AnkyrinG labeling in over-fixed tissue. Scale bar: 20 μm.\n(D) Visualization and measurement of the AIS (AnkyrinG, green, top) in a biocytin labeled neuron (Bioc, grayscale, middle) and merged (lower). Scale bar: 20 μm.\nCritical: All tools and consumables used for fixation of tissue should be entirely separate from electrophysiology tools. The presence of PFA is highly deleterious to vitality of neurons and all steps should be taken to separate physiology and fixation areas, including separate bench space.\nNote: At this point, it can be helpful to transfer fixed slices to a multi-well plate for storage and future immunolabeling. Each experimental slice should occupy its own individual well and be labeled with a unique experimental identifier (i.e., date and slice number)\nPause Point: Slices can be stored 4°C for up to 1 week before proceeding to immunohistochemistry.\nImmunohistochemistry of fixed acute brain slices\nTiming: 3–4 days",
    "This step allows for recovery of the recorded cells to assess their morphology and concomitant visualization and measurement of axon initial segments (AIS) in the same slices (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). This process is highly reliable and allows for accurate detection of AIS structure, as well as measurement of somatodendritic structure. Inclusion of anti-NeuN primary antibodies labels neuronal somata and can help visualize the hippocampal formation.\nWash slices thoroughly in PBS:\nRemove excess storage PBS from well with plastic Pasteur pipette.\nFill well containing slice with fresh PBS (approx. 3–5 mL).\nRepeat a further 2–3 times to fully remove any residual buffer and PFA. Washes should last 5–10 min per repetition.\nCritical: Care should be taken to maintain the order of which slice is within which well of the multi-well plate.\nBlock non-specific antigenicity in slices, to improve signal to noise of immunolabeling:\nPrepare blocking solution containing 10% normal goat serum (NGS), 0.3% Triton X-100 (to allow membrane permeabilization and antibody penetration) and 0.05% NaN3 (to limit microbial growth), in PBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL of blocking solution to each well of a 24-well plate labeled with the unique slice identifiers.\nTransfer each slice to their according well with a soft, fine paintbrush.\nNote: Care should be taken to not damage the slice. Slices are best lifted out of the well by sliding the brush under the slice and lifting out of the buffer in an upwards motion.\nBlock slices for 1 h at 20°C ± 2°C (room temperature) in the blocking solution.\nIncubate slices with primary antibodies:\nPrepare fresh antibody dilution solution, containing: 5% NGS, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.05% NaN3 all diluted in PBS.\nAdd primary antibodies:\nMouse anti-AnkyrinG (1 μg/mL or 1:1,000 of neat antisera)\nRabbit anti-NeuN (1 μg/mL or 1:1,000 of neat antisera)",
    "Note: Antibodies should be stored according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. For most primary antibodies, we prepare aliquots of neat antisera (5–20 μL) and store at −20°C until used. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles of antibodies severely impair their antigenicity.\nAdd 0.5 mL of prepared antibody solution to each well of a fresh, clean 24-well plate.\nTransfer slices to their according well with a paintbrush, rinsing the brush in clean PBS between slices.\nCover the 24-well plate with lab film (i.e., Parafilm) to prevent evaporation of buffer.\nPlace 24-well plate on orbital shaker in cool room or fridge.\nIncubate slices for at least 18 to 24 h (overnight) at 4°C.\nNote: For thick slices, longer incubation can improve the penetration of antibodies deeper into the slice. As such, we often incubate for 2–3 days rather than just 1 overnight period.\nWash slices thoroughly in PBS:\nFill clean multi-well plates with PBS buffer.\nTransfer slice from primary antibody plate to PBS buffer using a fine paintbrush.\nRemove excess storage PBS from well with plastic Pasteur pipette.\nFill well containing slice with fresh PBS (approx. 3–5 mL).\nRepeat a further 2–3 times to fully remove any residual buffer. Washes should last 5–10 min per repetition.\nCritical: Care should be taken to maintain the order of which slice is within which wellplate well.\nApply secondary antibodies:\nPrepare secondary antibody buffer: 3% NGS, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.05% NaN3 in PBS.\nAdd secondary antibodies:\nGoat anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (4 μg/mL or 1:500 of neat sera)\nGoat anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 633 (4 μg/mL or 1:500 of neat sera)\nStreptavidin-Alexa Fluor 568 conjugate (4 μg/mL or 1:500 of neat sera)",
    "Note: Use streptavidin conjugated fluorophore with same spectral properties as the Alexa Fluor dye used to fill neurons during the recording. (i.e., Streptavidin-AlexaFluor568 conjugate is used with Alexa 568 hydrazide dye) to avoid potential contamination of signals with residual fluorescence from filling.\nNote: Secondary antibody combinations can be tailored to your specific confocal microscope configuration. Given the relative size and labeling strength of AnkyrinG, shorter wavelengths are optimal. As NeuN is less important for reconstruction of neurons, we often use this in the far-red channel.\nAdd 0.5 mL of prepared antibody solution to each well of a fresh, clean 24-well plate.\nTransfer slices to their according well with a paintbrush, rinsing the brush in clean PBS between slices.\nCover the 24-well plate with lab film (i.e., Parafilm) to prevent evaporation of buffer.\nPlace 24-well plate on orbital shaker in cool room or fridge.\nIncubate for 18 to 24 h at 4°C.\nWash slices thoroughly in PBS:\nFill clean multi-well plates with PBS buffer.\nTransfer slice from primary antibody plate to PBS buffer using a fine paintbrush.\nRemove excess storage PBS from well with plastic Pasteur pipette.\nFill well containing slice with fresh PBS (approx. 3–5 mL).\nRepeat a further 2–3 times to fully remove any residual buffer. Washes should last 5–10 min per repetition.\nDesalt slices:\nFill clean multi-well plates with 0.1 M PB buffer (3–5 mL/well).\nTransfer slice from PBS buffer to PB buffer using a fine paintbrush.\nRinse paintbrush between transfers.\nStir on orbital shaker for 10–15 min.\nRemove excess storage PB from well with plastic Pasteur pipette.\nFill well containing slice with fresh PB (approx. 3–5 mL).\nStir on orbital shaker for 1 h.\nMount slices on glass slides:\nLabel glass microscope slide with unique slice identifier and antibodies used.",
    "Remove slice from PB multi-well plate using paintbrush.\nBlot excess PB from slice by touching brush to a piece of tissue, then gently lay slice on slide.\nCritical: When mounting slices on glass slide, maintain the side of the slice with the recorded cell facing up. The correct side of the slice can be identified by the marks left by the threads of the slice weight used during electrophysiological recordings. Alternatively, a note of the slice orientation can be made during recording.\nBlot any residual PB buffer from slice, using a cut wedge of tissue or filter paper.\nPlace sufficient fluorescent mounting medium (e.g., Vectashield Hardset mounting medium) on slice (2–3 drops for 22 × 22 mm coverslip).\nLay coverslip over slice.\nNote: To prevent bubbles forming on slice surface, it is advised to lay coverslip from one edge, then slowly allow remainder of coverslip to fall into place.\nPlace mounted slides in a cool, dark place for 1–2 h to allow hardset mounting medium to harden.\nSeal coverslips with nail polish around the edge.\nOnce nail polish has cured place slides in slide box for at least 1 day before imaging.\nPause Point: Slides can be kept at 4°C for a few days before imaging, but it is recommended that images are taken within the first 2 weeks post-immunohistochemistry to avoid deterioration of labeling quality with time.\nConfocal imaging of the AIS and filled neurons\nTiming: 20–60 min per slice\nThis step allows for recovery of morphology of the recorded cell and concomitant visualization of AISs in the slice.\nOnce slides have fully equilibrated with the mounting medium (∼1 day) the refractive index of the fixed slices will have reduced to facilitate imaging.",
    "Place slices at 20°C ± 2°C (room temperature) ∼15 min prior to imaging to allow warming to ambient temperature.\nAcquire high-resolution Z-stacks including CA1:\nPlace slide in confocal microscope.\nUnder epifluorescent imaging and a low magnification objective (×10 or ×20), identify the CA1 region by the presence of streptavidin labeling of the filled neurons.\nSet appropriate light path for confocal imaging and excitation laser wavelength according to the fluorophores used.\nApply a small amount (1–2 drops) of immersion medium and exchange objective lens to a 63× oil immersion objective.\nUse the volume imaging function of your confocal microscope to acquire high-resolution Z-stacks through CA1 (1,024 × 1,024 xy resolution, pixel size: 0.14 μm, 1 μm z steps).\nNote: Due to limited antibody penetration deeper in the slice, fluorescent labeling intensity is very bright in the slice surface and fainter deeper in the tissue, scan through optical sections at different depths to set the most appropriate laser intensity/detector gain that allows for high signal/noise for as much of the tissue as possible (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). For image acquisition, we used either an Axiovert LSM 510 or LSM800 laser scanning confocal microscopes (both Zeiss, Germany), which were obtained with 63× (1.4 NA) oil or silicone immersion objective lenses.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/467-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "(B) A single AIS followed through its z plane from start to end (white triangles) suitable for length measurement. Scale bar: 10 μm. (B′) The same AIS, but overlain with its segmented and measured extent (white overlay and text).\n(C) A second AIS followed through its z plane from start (white triangle) to the surface of the slice, where it is prematurely cut (white asterisk) and thus not suitable for length measurement. (C′) Z projection of the AIS represented in (C). Scale bar: 10 μm.\nOptional: This protocol is based on our recent study (Booker et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) in which we assessed the effect of prolonged depolarization with 15 mM KCl on AIS length. Nonetheless the presence of biocytin filled neurons and the quality of AnkG labeling in these sections also allow for a deeper morphological analysis of the AIS and reconstruction of CA1 PC morphology. In that case imaging conditions must be adapted for each specific purpose as described in steps 33 and 34.\nFor 3-dimensional reconstruction of neurons, including the AIS, start by obtaining high-resolution images, to allow deconvolution of images and accurate surface rendering.\nNote: We use the Huygens deconvolution software to deconvolve images. Other software is available, however images should be collected to Nyquist sample the 3-dimensional volume.\nPlace histological slide in microscope.\nUnder low magnification (i.e., 10× or 20× Objective lens) identify the CA1 region of the slice. The specific microscope settings depend on the quality of the labeling and the choice of fluorescent markers used.\nApply a small amount (1–2 drops) of immersion medium and exchange objective lens.\nNote: Use the appropriate immersion medium for your objective lens, according to manufacturer’s guidelines.\nUnder high magnification identify the str. pyramidale layer of CA1.",
    "Using the volume imaging function of your confocal microscope set the top (slice surface) and bottom (end of intense labeling) extents of your 3-dimensional volume.\nSet the z-step size to 0.13 μm.\nEstablish optimal laser power and detector gain settings for start and end of volume.\nIf microscope is capable, set these values to automatically modulate over the slice depth.\nAcquire image stack at 2,048 × 2,048 resolution under 2× zoom, which gives a pixel width of 0.04 μm (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/467-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Note the sharper edges of the morphology and clearer association of AnkyrinG to the plasma membrane.\n(C) Three-dimensional reconstruction and rendering of the same AIS following deconvolution. Note the spine located on the AIS (ar). Scale bar: 10 μm.\nDuring acquisition modulate the detector gain and laser power to generate consistent image quality through volume.\nNote: The images presented here were collected using a LSM800 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The specific microscope settings were 1.2% of maximum power from a continuous spectrum laser and 599 V gain on the PMT detectors.\nCritical: For appropriate volume rendering of AIS structure under diffraction limited light microscopy a voxel with vertices of 0.04 × 0.04 × 0.13 μm is optimal.",
    "Full neuron morphology can be examined and reconstructed using a similar method, albeit with larger step sizes (0.5–1 μm) and no zoom, as described previously (Booker et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: Due to the axial point-spread function produced by imaging with longer wavelength fluorophores and in the depth of tissue smaller step sizes are not required."
