    "All experiments presented in this protocol were approved by the Veterinary Authorities of the Canton Zurich, Switzerland (approval numbers 134/2014 and ZH088/19). Moreover, all steps performed in this experiment were in accordance with the Guidelines on Experiments with Animals by the Swiss Academy of Medial Sciences (SAMS) and Guidelines of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).\n1. Anesthesia induction and animal monitoring\nKeep male Wistar rats with a weight of 250-300 gram (g) in ventilated cages under pathogen-free conditions. Provide a 12-12-hour light/dark cycle at an ambient temperature of 22 ± 1 °C, and free access to food and water.\nInduce general anesthesia either by volatile induction with isoflurane (concentration of 3-5%) in an anesthesia induction box for 30 seconds (Figure 1A) or alternatively, induce anesthesia with a single-shot injection of ketamine/xylazine (10/1 milligram (mg) per 100 g body weight).\nTransfer the animal to a working place and lay the animal on a heating-mat throughout the entire experiment. Keep the body-temperature between 36.5 and 37 °C.\nUse a nosecone to provide oxygen (600 mL/minute). Add isoflurane 2-3% if volatile anesthesia was chosen for anesthesia maintenance. Make sure that the animal is spontaneously breathing.\nConfirm the level of anesthesia by the absence of the toe-pinch reflex prior to the installation of tracheostomy and arterial and venous catheters.\nVerify a sufficient oxygenation by peripheral oxygen saturation monitoring (normal oxygen saturation 98 - 100%).\nUse an ointment (Vitamin A ointment) to protect the eyes.\nPrepare sterile surgical instruments and catheters on a side table as displayed in Figure 1B.\nAdditionally, prepare pressure and oxygen saturation monitoring as displayed in Figure 1C.\n2. Intravenous access\nApply a tourniquet at the rat's proximal tail to facilitate venous access (Figure 2A).\nDisinfect the tail 3 times with alcohol.",
    "Induce a G26 intravenous catheter into one of the two lateral tail veins.\n\tNOTE: From our experience it is easier to place the intravenous access at the distal part of the rat's tail, because the vein here is located closer to the skin. In addition, in case of a failed cannulation, there is enough space to move proximally.\nStrictly avoid air injection.\nUntie the tourniquet after placing the intravenous catheter.\nFix the intravenous catheter in place with adhesive tape (Figure 2B).\nConnect syringe-pumps to the intravenous access for continuous fluid and drug application.\nUse 3-way stopcocks for bolus fluid, drug application, and venous blood sampling.\n3. Tracheostomy\nShave the animal's anterior neck-area.\nDisinfect the shaved skin 3 times with providone-iodine solution.\nPerform a circa 2 cm longitudinal incision using a scalpel (with a blade number 10).\nRetract the skin with 2-0 silk sutures.\nBluntly prepare the larynx and the trachea with surgical scissors (Figure 3A).\nMake sure to open the trachea with surgical micro scissors at the 3-5th tracheal clasp.\nInsert a sterile tracheal cannula into the trachea. Be careful, do not insert the cannula too deeply in order to avoid unilateral ventilation.\nFix the cannula in place using a 2-0 silk suture.\nConnect the cannula to a ventilator for pressure or volume-controlled ventilation (Figure 3B).\n4. Arterial access\nDisinfect the rat tail 3 times with povidone-iodine solution.\nCut the skin using a scalpel (with a blade number 10) circa 1 cm longitudinally at the ventral side.\nTake care, do not cut too deeply to avoid an injury of the tail artery.\nUse a surgical microscope to expose the artery carefully. Cut the fascia surrounding the artery with surgical micro scissors.\nLigate the distal part of the artery using a 6-0 silk suture.",
    "Prepare a proximal 6-0 silk suture but do not tighten the silk (Figure 4A).\nIntroduce a G-26 catheter into the artery between the distal and proximal silk suture.\nOnce the catheter is in the artery, tighten the proximal silk suture and fix the catheter in place (Figure 4B).\nConnect the catheter to a pressure transducer to provide continuous arterial pressure measurement (normal mean arterial pressure: 60 - 100 mmHg) (Figure 4C).\nAdditionally, place a 3-way stopcock between the catheter connected to the pressure transducer and the G-26 catheter for arterial blood sampling.\n5. Baseline measurement, sepsis induction and follow-up measurements\nAfter the animal reached a steady state, inject the LPS.\nCollect blood samples when a steady state is reached (usually after 15-30 minutes).\nReplace fluid loss from blood samples by Ringer's solution in a ratio of 1:4.\nTo induce sepsis, inject the LPS as a bolus or as a continuous LPS application.\nFor the bolus application, inject 1 mg of LPS/kilogram body weight (kg) dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.\nFor continuous application, inject 300 µg of LPS/kg/hour throughout the entire experiment using a syringe pump (stock solution of LPS: 1 mg/mL in PBS).\nAvoid air-injection at all times in order to prevent air embolism.\nDefine fluid replacement protocols, vasoconstrictor application protocols, and abortion criteria (for example hypotension defined as a mean arterial blood pressure below 50 mmHg for more than 30 minutes despite fluid replacement) before setting up the experiment.\n\tNOTE: We suggest a continuous infusion of Ringer's solution at a rate of 10 mL/kg/hour.\nSubtract any continuous administration of fluids (e.g., for continuous LPS application) from the amount infused so that the results are comparable with those of the control groups.",
    "NOTE: At the end of the experiment, and prior to harvesting any organs such as liver, kidney or spleen for further analyses such as histological or biochemical examination animals can be euthanized by an incision of the inferior cava vein. The recommended method of euthanasia is to bring the animals to a surgical plane of anesthesia prior to incision of the inferior vena cava and injection of ice-cold saline into the left heart, especially if inflammatory markers in organs are to be assessed. Ensure to comply with the legal requirements and local guidelines. To verify sepsis-related organ failure, pro-apoptosis marker like caspase-3 may be analyzed as well as α1-microglobuline to verify tubular damage in the kidneys. The organ specific analysis of markers like CINC-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 may also provide information about the organ specific inflammatory response.\nSubscription Required.
