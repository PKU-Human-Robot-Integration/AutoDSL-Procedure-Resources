  "procedures": [
    "1. Conditioning of Animals for Temperature, Nutrition and Light/Dark Cycle\nObtain Nematostella vectensis adults from one of the numerous Nematostella labs worldwide, or a non-profit supplier (Table 1)\nMaintain Nematostella at constant temperature (typically between 18 and 21 °C) in the dark, in \"1/3x\" Artificial Sea Water (ASW) at a salinity of 12 parts per thousand (ppt). Maintain cultures in simple soda-lime glass culture dishes, typically 250 mL or 1.5 L capacity11.\n\tNote: These simple culture conditions are commonly used among labs that study Nematostella, but culture care can also be automated19.\nFeed Nematostella freshly hatched Artemia nauplii 2 - 4x per week. Hatch Artemia cysts in full strength (36 ppt) or 1/3x ASW at 30 °C, in a shallow rectangular glass dish20 or in any of a number of small scale, commercial or homemade brine shrimp hatcheries. If an incubator is not available, shrimp will hatch at RT but do so more slowly.\n\tNote: This often requires more than 24 h for completion.\nReplace anemone culture water at least once a week. For best adult health, thoroughly clean (without soap) the culture bowls once a week of accumulated mucous secretions, which coat the bowl and can trap uneaten food and waste, and entangle the animals.\n2. Selection and Relaxation of Nutritionally Conditioned Animals\nSelect size-matched polyps of approximately the same length (3 - 5 cm, when naturally relaxed) and place them in a bowl separated from the colony for three days prior to amputation.",
    "Note: The number of animals selected for cutting will be determined by the experiment being conducted, of course, but in general we recommend at least five animals per sample point with six replications. Thus, in a typical experiment a minimum of 30 animals would be preselected. In general, it is wise to select more than the minimum number (30) since amputations that are irregular (see below) can later affect scoring.\nRemove the dish of selected animals from the incubator into room light at least one hour prior to amputation.\n\tNote: Exposure to room light and vibrations of handling will likely cause the animals to contract, so they need to be adapted or \"relaxed\" by incubation on the lab bench. Animals will become refractory to touch and light exposure and at that point can be moved by gentle pipetting.\nOptional: Anesthetize the animals by adding 7.5% MgCl2 (in 1/3x ASW). Gently add the MgCl2 solution to the bowl with a standard plastic 5 mL pipette.\n\tNote: Although animals will eventually become habituated to the light and to physical manipulation, it may be advantageous to anesthetize animals to maintain or \"fix\" the relaxed state after they have become elongated16,21,22.\nUse a wide bore (>0.5 cm) plastic pipette to transfer (in 1/3x ASW) five animals from the pool to be amputated, into the bottom of a sterile glass cutting dish of 100 mm diameter containing 12 ppt ASW. Place the dish on to the stage of a stereomicroscope with variable magnification between 10 - 40X.\n\t​Note: If the animals have not been anesthetized and relaxed for cutting, they may still respond to touch and stereoscope illumination and thus may need a few minutes to become relaxed again.\n3. Amputation",
    "Using a sterile scalpel, amputate the aboral physa from each polyp, with the goal to obtain a section of the physa that is approximately as long as it is wide and containing no mesentery.\n\tNote: The ideal cut site is just aboral to the termination of the mesentery. At the plane of cutting there is a transition from mesentery proper to thin lines corresponding to each mesenterial insertion (see Figure 1, arrows). Absence of mesentery is critical because it produces mucous that may facilitate 'plugging' the hole17,30.\n\t\nPlace the scalpel blade in contact with the animal at the desired site of amputation. Do this either unassisted (freehand), or by gently grasping the animal's body with a #5 forceps (Dumont style or similar).\nCut through the tissue by leveraging the curved blade of the scalpel in a 'rocking' motion across the body.\n\t\tNote: The tissue should sever cleanly as the scalpel is rocked and liberate the desired section of physa from the donor. However, if a small piece of tissue still connects the body and the physa, cut it with the scalpel. Do not attempt to separate the connected pieces by pulling, as this may damage the physa.\nRemove each amputated 'donor' polyp from the dish and return it to a separate bowl labeled 'pooled amputees'; date the bowl and return it to stock culture.\n\tNote: Amputated polyps will heal the aboral wound within a day and then can be fed normally. They will regenerate a normal looking physa within two weeks at which point the physa can be amputated again if desired.",
    "Rinse the excised physa that remain in the cutting dish in 12 ppt ASW, then transfer each physa to a separate sterile well in a multi-well cell culture plate that already has 10 mL of 12 ppt ASW in each well.\n\tNote: This example uses a six well plate, with each well holding 10 mL of seawater and five excised physa. In general seawater should cover the physa sufficiently to avoid exposure to air due to movement in handling and potential evaporation. The plate or wells should have a lid.\nRepeat steps 3.1 - 3.3 to collect at least 5 physa in each well reserved for each experimental treatment.\nIncubate the physa at a temperature that will provide the best rate of regeneration for the planned experimental interrogations. Place the plate containing the physa into a temperature regulated incubator, at a fixed temperature determined by the desired rate of regeneration.\n\t​Note: The physa will regenerate missing tissues and form a full polyp when incubated at temperatures between 15 and 27 °C. The rate of regeneration is temperature dependent except for the first two stages. The average day for reaching Stage 4 for all temperatures is 7 d after cutting and this also coincides with regeneration at 21 °C. At 27 °C, Stage 4 is reached about 3 days earlier and at 15 °C, Stage 4 is delayed by about 3 d compared to regeneration at 21 °C (also see Reference 10).\n4. Assessing Regeneration with the Nematostella Regeneration Staging System (NRSS)\nScore the physa using a stereo-compound microscope with variable magnification (10 - 80X). Score the freshly cut Nematostella physa as Stage 0 and continue scoring at the same time each day post amputation (dpa) using the NRSS10.\n\tNote: For key staging criteria and details refer Reference 10.",
    "Score physa as Stage 0 (Open Wound) if a freshly cut physa appears as a cup- shaped mass resembling a flaccid balloon, with an open wound site is likely visible.\n\t\t​Note: The wound edges might also stick together from the outset, but the tissue will still be collapsed and lack rigidity. The edges of the open wound may be observed undergoing radial contraction as the wound heals.\nScore physa as Stage 1 (Wound Closed) if the amputation wound appears closed.\n\t\tNote: Wound location will correspond to the future oral pole. The outer surface around the future oral pole may begin to display distinct arches corresponding to the underlying radially symmetric endodermal mesenterial insertions.\nScore physa as Stage 2 (Radial Arches) if the surface of the oral pole appears inflated, revealing eight raised arches arranged in a radially symmetric pattern and separated by grooves. Observe small, hemispherical blebs at the apex of the arches. They will be about as tall as wide, likely transient, and initially comprised by a single ectodermal cell layer.\n\t\tNote: In some cases double-layered blebs may stabilize. Note: At this or later stages a mucous layer may appear to encapsulate the physa (Figure 2) in a membranous 'sheath'. This encapsulating material should be removed to facilitate scoring.\nScore physa as Stage 3 (Tentacle) if the buds of the tentacles containing endodermal and ectodermal tissue layers are stably formed at the oral end of at least some radial arches.\n\t\tNote: The tentacles are longer than they are wide and are minimally motile. The physa will show increased, but variable inflation so that mesentery rudiments may become visible extending from the mesenterial insertion into the body cavity (coelenteron).",
    "Score physa as Stage 4 (Linear Mesenteries) if the physa contains eight distinct, visible mesenteries that extend into the coelenteron from insertions in the body wall, with oral-aboral lengths that are more than twice their radial width measured from where they appear to connect to the pharynx at its aboral end (enterostome).\n\t\tNote: Four or fewer mesenteries have \"pleated\" internal free edges. The pharynx is visible. More than eight tentacles are visible, motile and sometimes they contract into the body.\nScore physa as Stage 5 (Predominantly Pleated Mesenteries) if the physa has more than four mesenteries with pleating, and the pleating is more full and sinuous than at Stage 4. The animal has an almost \"normal\" adult appearance, but there are no visible gonadal cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
