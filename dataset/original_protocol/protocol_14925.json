    "Animals are housed in a barrier pathogen free facility. All animals receive human care in compliance with the “Principals of Laboratory Animal Care” formulated by the National Society for Medical Research” and the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication no. 86-23, revised 1985). All experiments are approved by the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.\n1. Recipient Preparation\nAnesthetize the recipient animal with an i.m. injection of xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight).\nRemove all hair of the lateral cervical region of the animal and scrub the operative field three times using chlorhexdine.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position on the operative field.\nNext make a skin incision from the jugular incision to the right lower mandible.\nSubsequently, bluntly mobilize the right external jugular vein (EJV) and divide the branches between ligatures.\nThen divide the EJV between ligatures making sure to leave enough length to evert the proximal stump over the cuff body.\nNext remove the right lobe of the submandibular gland.\nFor the venous anastomosis pass the proximal end of the EJV through the polyethylene cuff and fix it at the handle of the cuff with a micro clamp.\nRemove the ligature at the end of the vessel, evert the lumen over the cuff and fix it with an 8-0 silk loop (Figure 1a).\nSubsequently transect the right sternocleidomastoid muscle with bipolar cautery to gain access to the common carotid artery.\nNext mobilize the common carotid artery and cut the vessel between the ligatures.\nNext mobilize the common carotid artery and cut the vessel between the ligatures.",
    "Pass the distal end of the vessel through the cuff and fix it with the artery clamp.\nRemove the ligature at the end of the vessel and distend the lumen using vascular dilatators. Next, in analogy to the EJV, evert the artery over the cuff and fix it with an 8-0 silk loop.\n2. Heart Procurement\nAnesthetize the donor mouse with an i.m. injection of xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight). Then remove all hair of the abdominal region of the animal. Scrub the operative field three time using chlorhexdine. Next place the mouse in a supine position on the operative field as previously described.\nFollowing a midline abdominal incision, retract the viscera with Q-tips to the left in order to expose the inferior vena cava (IVC).\nInject 400 μl of a 1:4 heparin- sodium- solution into the IVC for heparinization.\nPerform a thoracotomy and fold the anterior chest wall over cranially to gain access to the heart.\nNext, remove the thymus and make venting incisions in the left and right superior vena cava.\nSubsequently, perfuse the heart in a retrograde fashion with 4° Celsius HTK solution by cannulation of the aortic arch with a 27 G syringe at the level of the brachiocephalic branch.\nLigate the inferior and superior vena cava with 8-0 silk and divide them distally to the ligatures.\nNext divide the aortic arch at the level of the previous cannulation and dissect free the pulmonary trunk and divide it as far distally as possible.\nFollowing that, tie the pulmonary veins with a bulk ligation and divide them distally to the ligatures.\nFinally, remove the heart from the donor site and store it in 4° Celsius HTK solution (Figure 1b).\n3. Implantation",
    "Place the heart graft in the recipient neck region in an upside down position (Figure 1c).\nNext pull the pulmonary trunk of the heart over the vein cuff construct of the recipient and fix it with a silk loop (Figure 1d).\nPerform the anastomosis between the aorta of the graft and the everted artery of the recipient animal in the same fashion (Figure 1e).\nSubsequently, remove the venous clamp first, followed by the arterial clamp. The heart is reperfused and starts beating within 1-2 min. During reperfusion moisten the heart with warm (35° Celsius) saline.\nFinally close the surgical wound with 6-0 continuous sutures (Figure 1e).\n4. Postoperative Care, Endpoint\nGive up to 0.3 ml normal saline i.p. postoperatively for fluid replacement.\nPlace the animal under a heat lamp until awaking from anesthesia.\nOnce awake, return the animal to the housing facility where they receive food and water ad libitum.\nTo minimize pain during the first 7 postoperative days administer carprofen (4mg/kg every 12 hr subcutaneously (s.c.). In addition, give Buprenorphin (0.1 mg/kg) right after the operation every 12 hr for 5 days.\nObtain the weight (g) of each recipient animal weekly to assess for proper nutritional intake. If there is evidence of more than 10-15% weight loss compared to weight at surgery-date, apathy, crippling or a very bent back, sacrifice the animal using terminal isoflurane inhalation before reaching the clinical end point. Also sacrifice the animal after the heart has been rejected.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
