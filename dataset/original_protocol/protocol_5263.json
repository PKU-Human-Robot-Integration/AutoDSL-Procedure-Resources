    "crRNA designTo select target sequences of crRNAs, a list of possible sgRNAs are required first. We recommend using online web tools such as CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu/[href=http://crispr.mit.edu/]) or CRISPRdirect (https://crispr.dbcls.jp/[href=https://crispr.dbcls.jp/]) for this purpose. Choose a pair of sgRNAs with the following criteria: spacer distance is 4-20 base pairs (bp) for nCas9 or is 14-19 bp for fCas9 (Figure 1) and the pair of sgRNAs must be located on opposite strands of genomic DNA (Ran et al., 2013; Hara et al., 2015).Design crRNA sequences by removing the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and replacing T (thymine) with U (uracil) from the sequences of a pair of sgRNAs as shown in Figure 1.Have selected crRNAs (42 nt) and tracrRNA (69 nt) chemically synthesized and purified by HPLC. We adjust the concentration of crRNAs and tracrRNA to 1 µg/µl.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170602/20170602013519_9985.jpgFigure 1. Design of crRNA target sites for modified Cas9s. (Top) crRNA target sites are underlined in genomic DNA. Both the sense and antisense strands of a portion of the genomic sequence at the intronic region of the Bcr gene are shown. (Middle) The two target sites for crRNAs are underlined. Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences (NGG) appear in bold letters. The spacer sequence is indicated by a gray dashed double-headed arrow. (Bottom) crRNA sequence (42 nt) for each target site and the sequence of tracrRNA (69 nt) are shown. The crRNA-specific sequence (22 nt), derived from Jinek et al. (2013), is shown in blue. Uracil is shown in red.Preparation of Cas9 mRNAPreparation of DNA templates for in vitro transcriptionSynthesize Cas9 mRNA in an in vitro transcription reaction using T7 RNA polymerase. Note, the plasmid that contains fCas9 has a T7 promoter sequence, but the plasmid that contains nCas9 does not (Figure 2).",
    "To add the T7 promoter sequence to the 5’ terminal of nCas9, amplify nCas9 by PCR with the following primers:T7-Cas9-F: TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATGGACAAGAAGTACTCCATTGG (underline: T7 promoter sequence)Cas9-R: TCACACCTTCCTCTTCTTCCheck the PCR product (4,163 bp) by agarose gel electrophoresis.Purify PCR products with the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (according to the manufacturer’s instructions). The concentration of purified products can be determined using a spectrophotometer.Digest the plasmid containing fCas9 with AgeI and purify the products with the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (according to the manufacturer’s instructions).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170602/20170602013830_4627.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of Cas9 mRNA. Schematic representations of Cas9 mRNA synthesis. Black lines and arrows show backbone vector and primers respectively. Cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV), nCas9 and fCas9 are boxed. T7 promoter sequences are depicted with green lines. (Left) Since nCas9 vector (Addgene #41816) does not contain T7 promoter, T7 promoter is added to the nCas9 coding sequence by PCR using T7-Cas9-F/Cas9-R primers and the plasmid as a template. PCR products are then subjected to in vitro transcription reaction. (Right) fCas9 vector (Addgene #52970) includes T7 promoter, which can be used for in vitro transcription reaction after linearization of the plasmid by AgeI digestion.In vitro transcription reactions are performed using the mMESSAGE/mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (according to the manufacturer’s instructions) with 2 µg of the PCR product or the linearized plasmid as template. After TURBO DNase treatment (included in the mMESSAGE/mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit), the transcribed RNA products are purified with the MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up Kit. We adjust the concentration of the mRNA product to 1 µg/µl. For microinjection, RNAs are mixed as follows:1 µg/µl of crRNA1 and crRNA2 2.84 µl each1 µg/µl of tracrRNA 9.32 µl1 µg/µl of nCas9 or fCas9 mRNA 7.5 µlRNase-free water 7.5 µlTotal volume = 30 µlNotes: Final concentrations of crRNA1, crRNA2, tracrRNA and Cas9 mRNA are 94.7, 94.7, 310.7 and 250 ng/µl, respectively.",
    "The molar ratios of crRNAs and tracrRNA are adjusted to be equal in the mixture. Molar ratios were calculated by dividing RNA concentration by RNA length. Molar ratios of crRNA1, crRNA2 and tracrRNA are 94.7 ng/µl/42 nt (= 2.25), 94.7 ng/µl/42 nt (= 2.25) and 310.7 ng/µl/69 nt (= 4.5), respectively.Although the RNA mixture can be stored for several months at -80 °C, we recommend that the RNA mixture be prepared fresh each time.Collection of fertilized eggsOn Day 1, induce superovulation in adult female mice by injecting them with 5 IU PMSG intraperitoneally. Forty-eight hours later (Day 3) inject the female mice with 5 IU hCG, then cross with adult male mice.On Day 4, sacrifice the female mice that were crossed on Day 3 and collect fertilized eggs from their oviducts. To remove cumulus cells, treat the zygotes with 0.3 mg/ml of hyaluronidase in M2 medium (see Recipes) at 37 °C for 1-5 min.Pick zygotes using mouth pipettes and then wash several times by pipetting in KSOM medium.Preparation of holding and injection pipettesGlass capillaries are drawn out using a capillary puller.Holding and injection pipettes are prepared from drawn-out pipettes using a microforge.Before injection, centrifuge the RNA mixture at 12,000 x g for 10 min. Fill the injection pipettes with 3-5 µl of the supernatant of the RNA mixture by microloader.Coat the outside of the RNA-filled injection pipettes with dichlorodimethylsilane.MicroinjectionPut the fertilized eggs in a drop of M2 medium and insert the injection pipette into the cytoplasm of zygote. Inject the RNA mixture (1-5 pl) into the cytoplasm. The amount of the injected solution can be controlled using FemtoJet.Pool the injected eggs in M2 medium. Wash the zygotes several times with KSOM medium. Incubate in a drop of KSOM drop at 37 °C until next day.",
    "2-cell embryo transferObtain pseudopregnant mice by crossing adult ICR females with vasectomized male mice on the same day of microinjection (Day 4).On the morning of Day 5, check ICR females for a vaginal plug. If the ICR female has a vaginal plug, then it is considered to be pseudopregnant.Isolate injected embryos that have reached the 2-cell stage by picking them up in a minimal volume of KSOM medium (10-18 embryos). Transfer these embryos into either oviduct an anesthetized, pseudopregnant female mouse.Nineteen days after transplantation, newborn mice should be obtained.Note: Procedure C to Procedure F is a standard procedure of embryo treatment that is detailed in Nagy et al. (2003).Genotyping the founder mice by PCR direct sequencingIsolate genomic DNA from a tail tip using a standard procedure (Nagy et al., 2003).Amplify the region of interest using primers designed around crRNA target sequences by performing PCR with the genomic DNA and primers spanning the crRNAs target sequences. Treat the PCR products with ExoSAP-IT (or Qiaquick PCR purification Kit) and sequence with either primer used for PCR."
