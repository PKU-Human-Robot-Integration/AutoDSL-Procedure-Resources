    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConcentrate parasites\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis step describes how to collect highly concentrated parasites at the schizont stage [Part A] or ring stage [Part B] for MalariaCometChip experiments. Depending on which stage of parasites will be used to assess DNA damage, one could choose from either Part A or Part B.\n[Part A] If the objective is to quantify DNA damage at schizont stage:\nAfter obtaining synchronized ring stage culture with high parasitemia in Step 2 of the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section, maintain the culture until the majority of the parasites reaches mid- to late-schizont stage (roughly after 24 h for P. falciparum 3D7).\nObtain purified schizont stage parasites (∼90% parasitemia) using Percoll gradient.\nTransfer parasite culture from the flask to a 50 mL tube.\nSpin down at 1000 RCF, 3 min, brake set to 2 and remove supernatant.\nResuspend 1 mL pellet into 4 mL iRPMI.\nAdd 10 mL Percoll solution into a 15 mL tube.\nGently lay the parasite suspension onto the Percoll solution by slowly dripping the parasite suspension along the tube wall using a sterile dropper.\nNote: Try to avoid sudden drops across the interface between Percoll and cell suspension.\nCentrifuge at 1000 RCF, 11 min, brake 0.\nCollect the schizont stage parasites, which are concentrated at the interface of the iRPMI and Percoll solutions, by inserting a dropper to the interface and sucking up the schizont pellet.\nAdd 20 mL iRPMI to the schizont pellet, resuspend, spin down at 1000 RCF, 3 min, brake set to 2 and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat previous step once.\n[Part B] If the objective is to quantify DNA damage at ring stage:\nObtain ring stage culture with high parasitemia.",
    "Inoculate purified late schizont stage parasites, ideally segmented schizonts, into fresh blood to obtain a final parasitemia around 3%.\nCulture for 18 h and synchronize the cell culture using 5% D-sorbitol as described above.\nCheck blood smear to make sure the parasitemia is near or exceeds 10%.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL iRPMI and transfer to a 1.5 mL tube.\nSpin down at 1000 RCF, 3 min, brake set to 2 and remove the supernatant.\nMeasure the volume of the pellet using a pipette.\nEnrich live ring stage parasites using SLO.\nNote: As a bacterial toxin, SLO can form pores in cholesterol-containing membranes and lyse cells in a non-osmotic manner. Previous studies found when added in a mixed population of uninfected and infected RBCs, SLO preferentially permeabilizes uninfected RBCs and thus enriches intact ring stage parasitized RBCs. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows the blood smear after SLO enrichment. The steps below are based on studies by Jackson et al. and Kulzer et al.\nCalculate the volume of SLO needed to lyse the pellet from Step 1c-vi:\n   V  (  a c t i v a t e d  S L O  n e e d e d  )   =   V  (  p e l l e t  )    20  u l   × 4  H U s  \nNote: HU should be determined after the preparation of SLO, and the protocol is described in detail by Kulzer et al (Kulzer et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nActivate SLO with 1 M DTT: for every 10 uL of SLO, add 1 uL of 1M DTT; mix gently and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nAdd 4 HUs of activated SLO as calculated above to parasite pellet and gently mix.\nIncubate for 6 min at RT and invert the tubes ten times every 2 min during incubation.",
    "Spin down at 1000 RCF, 3 min and remove supernatant.\nAdd 500 μL 1× PBS to the pellet and mix.\nSpin down at 1000 RCF, 3 min and remove supernatant.\nRepeat step vi-vii until the supernatant turns colorless.\nCheck blood smear to make sure parasitemia exceeds 90%.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/980-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Blood smear of enriched live ring stage parasites after SLO treatment\nScale bar, 10 μm.\nDrug treatment of parasites\nTiming: 20 min to 1 h\nThese steps describe how to treat parasites with agents/drugs on-chip [Part I] or off-chip [Part II]. In [Part I], cells are loaded in the CometChip and then treated with chemical (hydrogen peroxide in this protocol). Alternatively, in [Part II], cells are treated with chemical before being loaded in the CometChip. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] shows the key steps in [Part I] and [Part II], respectively.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/980-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Illustration of key steps for on-chip (A) and off-chip (B) drug treatment\nHere we use the alkaline CometChip, which detects single-stranded breaks, abasic sites, and alkali-sensitive moieties. Double strand breaks can be detected using the neutral CometChip as outlined in Ge et al. (Ge et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\n[Part I] On-Chip treatment using hydrogen peroxide.\nNote: Here we use a dose response to hydrogen peroxide, which causes oxidative damage, to illustrate that the CometChip is working as expected. For data, please refer to Xiong et al. 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] (Xiong et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Hydrogen peroxide was diluted in cold 1× PBS to the following doses: 100, 250, 500, 1000 μM. The negative control was 1× PBS. Each dose of hydrogen peroxide was loaded into 3 macrowells to create 3 technical replicates.\nNote: Other chemicals can be used to study different classes of DNA damage.\nResuspend 30 μL concentrated parasite pellet from [Concentrate Parasites] section in 6 mL cRPMI to achieve 0.5% hematocrit.",
    "Note: Here, a 2× surplus of parasite suspension is created in case of the need to re-load cells after step 3f.\nAdd 200 μL of parasite suspension into each well of the bottomless 96-well plate clamped to the CometChip gel.\nIncubate in 37°C incubator supplemented with 5% CO2, 3% O2, and 92% N2 for 15 min to load cells into microwells by gravity.\n[Optional] If low melting point agarose from Prepare CometChip stock solutions (see “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”) is being stored at higher temperatures, retrieve it and allow solution to cool to ∼43°C.\nUnclamp binder clips and gently remove the 96-well plate.\nPlace the chip at roughly a 30 degree angle and gently pipette 5 mL 1× PBS above the top row to wash away off-grid cells via shear force.\nCritical: Be careful not to pipette PBS directly on the CometChip wells, as this can wash away cells loaded in microwells. Instead, aim for the area of the CometChip just above the top row of macrowells. Wash by slowly expelling PBS from the pipette in drops - do not wash with too much force, as this can wash away cells loaded in microwells. For a demonstration of this step, we encourage users to watch the detailed JoVE video on the CometChip by Ge et al. (Ge et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCheck cell loading under a bright field microscope.\nNote: When inspecting the loaded CometChip under the bright field microscope, cells loaded in microwells should form a grid pattern; ensure >70% of microwells are loaded before proceeding. If there are a significant number of cells outside the grid, wash once more; if there are too few cells in the wells (e.g., more than 30% of the wells are empty), rinse with 1× PBS and repeat step 3b–3f to re-load cells.",
    "Retrieve low melting point agarose gel.\nNote: Gel solution should be cooled to ∼43°C before proceeding to the next step\nOverlay the CometChip with 4 mL 1% w/v low melting point agarose by gently dripping the melted agarose onto the chip and keep the CometChip at 4°C for 4 min to allow agarose to solidify.\nNote: To ensure the gel is evenly overlaid on the chip, make sure that the chip is completely covered by the low melting point agarose and that the gel is allowed to solidify on a level surface.\nApply a bottomless 96-well plate to the same position as in CometChip Fabrication Step 3m by lining up the edges so that the bottomless plate re-forms the same macrowells.\nUse 1.5” binder clips to clamp bottomless 96-well plate into place on a glass plate.\nAdd 100 μL of different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to appropriate wells and incubate chip at 4°C for 20 min in the dark.\nRemove the bottomless 96-well plate and proceed immediately to alkaline lysis (Step 5).\n[Part II] Off-chip treatment using artesunate.\nNote: This is an alternative approach to Part I; here the cells are treated before loading in the CometChip. It uses a completely new set of plates for this purpose.\nNote: Artesunate is used in this section. Artesunate is dissolved in 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution to final concentration of 50 mM (i.e. 19.2 mg in 1 mL 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution), and stored in 100 μL aliquots at −20°C for up to 6 months. The aliquots are used one time only (do not re-freeze). The final concentrations of artesunate used in this protocol are: 5, 50, 250, 500, 1000 nM.",
    "Prepare 10× solutions by diluting the stock with 7.5% sodium bicarbonate in series, preserve on ice or at 4°C if not used immediately. The same amount of sodium bicarbonate solution is considered as 0 nM control.\nDilute the 50 mM artesunate stock to 100 μM as follows:\n[50 μL] of 50 mM stock + [450 uL] of sodium bicarbonate = 5 mM artesunate\n[100 μL] of 5 mM artesunate solution + [900 μL] of sodium bicarbonate = 500 μM artesunate\n[200 μL] of 500 μM artesunate solution + [800 μL] of sodium bicarbonate = 100 μM artesunate\nLabel five 1.5 mL reaction tubes and add the amount of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution as shown in the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_980_12.csv\nResuspend 30 μL of the concentrated parasite pellet from [Concentrate Parasites] section in 6 mL cRPMI to achieve 0.5% hematocrit.\nIn a 96-well plate, add 20 μL of 10× artesunate solution (or negative control solution) and 180 μL cell suspension to each well, mix gently and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nNote: Malaria parasites are usually maintained at low parasitemia (i.e. 1%). High parasitemia may lead to death of the parasites. In this protocol, the parasites are concentrated to extremely high parasitemia (>90%) before drug treatment. Hence, it cannot be maintained for long time. Longer treatment times (>1 hour) are not recommended.\nAfter incubation, transfer 180 μL cell suspension from last step (Step 4 [Part II] c) to the CometChip for loading.\nPerform Steps 3 [Part I] -e to -i.\nAlkaline MalariaCometChip\nTiming: 2 days",
    "This section describes how to perform alkaline MalariaCometChip and collect data images. The alkaline CometChip steps are similar between MalariaCometChip and the CometChip performed using mammalian cells, we thus encourage users to watch the [Alkaline Comet Assay] section of the detailed JoVE video on the CometChip by Ge et al. (Ge et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])\nAlkaline lysis\nDirectly before use, make working alkaline lysis buffer by adding Triton X-100 to alkaline lysis stock solution at 1% v/v (i.e., 1 mL Triton X-100 per 100 mL alkaline lysis stock solution).\nNote: A small dish, such as a pipette tip box lid, can be used for the alkaline lysis incubation; a roughly 100 mL volume of working alkaline lysis buffer is usually sufficient to submerge the CometChip in a pipette tip box lid.\nNote: Cellular and nuclear membranes are lysed during this step.\nSubmerge the CometChip from Step 3 or 4 (either Part I or Part II, depending on experiment design) in roughly 100 mL cold alkaline lysis buffer; Make sure the chip is fully submerged in the buffer.\nCheck the CometChip after 5 min of incubation in lysis buffer; if the chip has floated to the top of the chamber, forceps can be used to push the chip back down into buffer so that it is submerged; alternatively, double-sided tape may be used to affix the chip to the bottom of the pipette tip box lid before covering in lysis buffer.\nKeep at 4°C overnight (usually more than 12 h).\nPause point: Chips can stay in alkaline lysis buffer for up to two consecutive nights so that chips from different days can undergo electrophoresis together.\nUnwinding and Electrophoresis\nNote: Standard electrophoresis chambers (i.e. Owl D-Series Horizontal Gel Systems from ThermoFisher) can be used to run the CometChip gel.",
    "Note: The CometChip is lighter than traditional agarose gels and thus double-sided tape should be used to affix the GelBond® side of the chip to the electrophoresis chamber to avoid floating or any movement of the chip during electrophoresis.\nAffix double-sided tape to the electrophoresis chamber.\nUsing forceps, remove the CometChip from the lysis buffer in the last step and gently dry the bottom of the GelBond® film using Kim wipes.\nTransfer the CometChip to the electrophoresis chamber; use forceps to gently press the CometChip gel onto the double-sided tape to ensure it is firmly in place.\nAdd cold electrophoresis buffer to the electrophoresis chamber to a volume that just covers the gel; there should be ∼5 mm of buffer above the gel.\nUnwind the DNA by incubating at 4°C for 40 min.\nCritical: To ensure reproducibility, strictly keep the unwinding time consistent for experiments.\nElectrophorese at 1 V/cm and ∼300 mA in the same buffer at 4°C for 30 min [troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]].\nCritical: Adjust the buffer volume to reach the expected voltage and amperage; it is important to keep the voltage and amperage consistent between experiments.\nNote: Electrophoresis buffer can be re-used one time.\nNeutralization\nImmediately after electrophoresis, transfer the CometChip to neutralization buffer and gently shake at RT for 15 min.\nNote: A small dish, such as a pipette tip box lid, can be used for the neutralization buffer incubation; a roughly 100 mL volume of neutralization buffer is usually sufficient to submerge the CometChip in a pipette tip box lid.\nWash the CometChip a second time in neutralization buffer: pour out the neutralization buffer and submerge the CometChip in another 100 mL fresh neutralization buffer, gently shake at RT for 15 min.",
    "Pause point: Chips can stay in neutralization buffer for up to two days. This enables chips from different days to be stained and imaged together, reducing potential inter-sample variability.\nStain\nSubmerge the chip in roughly 50 mL 1× SYBR Gold solution in 1× PBS in the dark using a small dish, such as a pipette tip box lid.\nNote: Other DNA staining solutions, such as ethidium bromide, can also be used.\nFluorescence microscopy\nPerform fluorescence microscopy at 40× magnification with a 480-nm excitation filter.\nNote: It is optimal to image 100–400 comets per condition (Ge et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), thus it is customary to load 1 to 3 macrowells per condition.\nNote: The number of wells needed per condition will also depend on loading efficiency; i.e. if 70% of microwells are loaded with cells, then an image of 1 macrowell should generate sufficient data for accurate analysis.\nNote: The number of images needed to capture all of the comets in a macrowell will depend on your specific microscope set up."
