    "Removal of embryo from egg The following section describes the removal of a chick embryo from the egg. The method is applicable to all patterning stages of development. Isolation can be performed outside a laminar flow hood, but eggs and instruments should be sterilised with 70% ethanol and, between use, instruments should be placed on sterilised tissue paper (autoclaving dissection tools is not necessary).Incubate embryos in a 37 °C incubator to appropriate HH stage. Use standard fine scissors to window the eggshell and No. 5 fine-tipped forceps to carefully peel away outer and inner shell membranes and vitelline membrane, without damaging the embryo.Use No. 5 fine-tipped forceps and standard fine scissors to cut around the embryo. Lift out and place in ice cold L-15 medium in a 10 cm Petri dish (Figure 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4898/bioprotoc-13-23-4898-g001.jpgFigure 1. Experimental setup for harvesting chick embryos. (A) Required dissection tools. (B) L-15 medium on ice and Brown Bovan fertilised eggs. (C) Examples of HH10 chick embryos after harvesting from the eggs and removal of membranes, yolk, and excess extra-embryonic tissue. Scale bar: 1 mm.Remove the chorioallantoic membrane and any contaminating yolk. Transfer embryo (with a minimal amount of medium) to clean L-15 medium in a 30 mm Petri dish using a wide-bore 3 mL Pasteur pipette and assess developmental stage.Cut away excess extra-embryonic tissue using Vannas scissors or an electrolytically sharpened tungsten needle, to leave the embryo surrounded by a small amount of extra-embryonic tissue (Figure 1C).If required, analyse a small piece of embryonic tissue by PCR to determine sex. The protocol we describe below is equally applicable to male and female animals.Top tip:  5 min rule. After removal from the egg, isolate the embryo from extraembryonic tissues as rapidly as possible (within 5 min).",
    "Transfer embryo to ice and keep on ice at all times to avoid tissue and RNA degradation.Hypothalamic isolation B1. Method 1 Isolation of neuroectoderm The following section describes the isolation of anterior neuroectoderm at three different stages: neural plate [Hamburger-Hamilton (HH6–HH8)], neural tube (HH9–HH12), and phylogenetic (HH13–HH25) stages. The same protocol can be adapted to isolate tissues from other germ layers and other species. Dispase is particularly effective in rapidly and gently separating the neuroectoderm from other tissue layers, while preserving its integrity and viability.Using tungsten needles, trim embryo in cold L-15 medium to isolate anterior embryonic regions, discarding posterior portions of the embryo and any remaining extraembryonic tissue (Figure 2A, 2F, 2K). Leave sufficient excess tissue to avoid damaging the hypothalamus at subsequent steps in the procedure, so make a posterior cut at the level of Hensen’s node (at HH6), somite 1 (at HH7–HH12), and midbrain (HH13–HH25).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4898/bioprotoc-13-23-4898-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Ellipse outlines hypothalamus. Abbreviations: HYP: hypothalamus; ME: mesendoderm; NE: neuroectoderm; OS: Optic stalk, CF: cephalic flexure. Scale bar: 250 μm.Transfer the anterior embryonic region into 0.5 mL of freshly made Dispase (1 mg/mL) in L-15 medium in a Nunc 4-well dish at room temperature. Depending on the size of tissue, transfer using siliconised glass pipette, appropriately sized Gilson pipette (P200 or P1000), or forceps (from small to large size, respectively), taking care to transfer minimal amounts of L-15 medium. The length of time of incubation is highly stage dependent (see Table 1). A rule of thumb is to observe the embryos until the tissue layers begin to visibly separate: the mesendoderm shrinks relative to ectoderm (Figure 2B, 2G, 2L). Once the reaction is complete, transfer the embryo regions from Dispase solution into a large volume of cold L-15 medium in a 10 cm dish. Allow embryos/embryonic regions to rest for 5–10 min.Table 1. Duration of Dispase treatment for the different chick developmental stages table:",
    "﻿HH stage,Duration of 1 mg/mL Dispase treatment\nHH6,5 min\nHH8,6–8 min\nHH10,10–12 min\nHH13/14,15–17 min\nHH17–20,18–20 min\nHH21–25,20–25 min",
    "Top tip 1:  Transferring embryo regions between dishes must be done with care to ensure that they do not become stuck in the pipette or rise and burst at the meniscus [the latter occurs readily if embryos are transferred from a warm to a cold solution, e.g., Dispase solution (room temperature) to cold L-15 medium]. To avoid, transfer under the microscope, avoid air bubbles, and transfer only a few embryo regions at a time (3–4).Top tip 2:  It is essential to optimise the Dispase concentration and incubation period. Tissues exposed to low concentrations of Dispase (even for longer incubation periods) will fail to separate; those exposed to high concentrations of Dispase, or incubated for too long, will become sticky, leading to a failure to obtain cleanly isolated tissue layers.Top tip 3:  For mouse tissues, which are more delicate than chick, reduce time in Dispase by 20%.Top tip 4:  Dispase-treated tissue fragments are transferred with a minimal volume of liquid into a large volume of L-15 medium, negating the need to inactivate the enzyme. However, if necessary, Dispase can be inactivated using a drop of 10% HINGS or BSA.Hypothalamus dissection The following section describes the isolation of hypothalamic tissue at neural plate, neural tube, and phylogenetic stages.Use tungsten needles (some prefer a combination of tungsten needles and micro knives) to dissect the neural tissue (i.e., neural plate, neural tube, or brain, depending on embryonic stage) away from other germ layers. To do so, use a holding needle in one hand to pin down the embryo region (avoid pinning down the hypothalamus), and use the long edge of the second needle to gently stroke away the mesendoderm, paring it from adjoining neuroectoderm. The ease and details through which this is achieved is stage dependent.",
    "At neural plate stages, the mesendoderm can be easily stroked away from adjacent neuroectoderm. The tissues can be readily distinguished: neuroectoderm is smoother and larger than mesendoderm (Figure 2C). The anterior–posterior axis can be distinguished through the headfold; the neural plate medial midline (which harbours prospective floor plate and hypothalamus) is obvious through its translucent appearance (Figure 2C, dotted outline). At neural plate stages, the neuroectoderm is contiguous with ectoderm, which will provide a useful holding tissue at subsequent stages of dissection. At neural tube and phylogenetic stages, mesendoderm and neuroectoderm do not separate as easily, and mesendoderm must be carefully peeled away around the optic vesicles, optic stalk and eyes, and hypothalamus. This can be achieved using tungsten needles and (where tissues are larger) sharp No. 5 forceps. Once isolated, the neural tissue should appear smooth and epithelial-like, with no contamination of round mesenchymal/mesendoderm cells (Figure 2H, 2M). Transfer isolated neuroectoderm into cold L15 medium using a siliconised glass Pasteur pipette or an appropriately sized Gilson pipette (P10, P20), again ensuring that the tissue does not rise to meniscus and bursts.Once the neural tissue is dissected, sub-dissect the hypothalamus (Figure 2D, 2H, 2I, 2M, 2N) using morphological criteria to define its limits. At HH6, the prospective hypothalamus is situated in and around anterior-most medial midline cells. Like more posterior midline cells, these are translucent but can be distinguished from these because they are slightly wider (Figure 2D). At HH10, the nascent hypothalamus occupies an area centred around a series of neuroepithelial folds in the ventral neuroectoderm. While most obvious after contrast microscopy (e.g., Figure 2I), the folds are morphologically visible under the dissecting microscope (Figure 2H) and provide a precise reference point for hypothalamic position.",
    "At later phylogenetic stages, the hypothalamus protrudes ventrally between the morphologically distinct optic chiasm and cephalic flexure (Figure 2L, 2M). Isolation of hypothalamic tissue is achieved in two steps. First, a domain encompassing the optic stalk, hypothalamus, and more dorsal diencephalic tissue is dissected using tungsten needles (limits shown by ellipse in Figure 2M, isolated region shown in Figure 2N). Second, this tissue is prepared as an open book. The hypothalamus is obvious as a violin-shaped domain, composed of a translucent medial domain and a thicker surrounding area, situated posterior to the optic stalks/developing optic chiasm (ellipse in Figure 2O).Top tip 1:  5 min rule. Except for the Dispase step, avoid removing the embryo from ice-cold L-15 medium for more than 5 min. With practice, the neuroectoderm can be isolated from the mesendoderm within 30–60 s (early stages) and 2–3 min (late stages). A good rule of thumb is to dissect one embryo at a time.Top tip 2:  At neural plate stages, proceed to dissect out the hypothalamus (Figure 2C) as rapidly as possible, or midline cells lose their translucent appearance.Top tip 3:  Routinely sharpen the cutting tungsten needle.Top tip 4:  Dissect in a relaxed and calm environment. Remember to breathe and keep your shoulders loose and back straight.B2. Alternate slicing method In the previous method, the anterior neural plate/neural tube is first isolated using Dispase, and the hypothalamus (or prospective hypothalamus) is then sub-dissected. Some find this approach difficult and prefer the following alternate method, in which embryos are first sliced into fragments, including a hypothalamic-containing fragment that is then treated with Dispase, and hypothalamic tissue isolated. This method is particularly useful for neural tube–stage embryos, where some find it difficult to pare away mesendoderm from the neuroepithelial folds that characterise the nascent hypothalamus at this stage.",
    "Transfer the dissected embryo to a clean 5 cm square plastic plate with as little liquid as possible (it must not dry out but must not float) and arrange it so it is flat (Figure 3A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4898/bioprotoc-13-23-4898-g003.jpgFigure 3.

(E) Anterior-most slices, removed from the plastic holder, arranged from anterior (top) to posterior (bottom). Arrows point to hypothalamus-containing slice. (F) Examples of HH10 slices, each containing hypothalamus, after Dispase treatment. (G) Slice containing hypothalamus from a HH9 embryo after Dispase treatment: dotted outline demarcates neuroectoderm and mesendoderm. (G’–G”) Same slice after isolation of neuroectoderm (G’) and sub-dissection to obtain hypothalamic explant (G”). Scale bar: 250 μm.Set the plate with the embryo onto the base of the tissue chopper, with the anterior–posterior axis of the embryo at a right angle to the tissue chopper blade (Figure 3B).Set the thickness of each slice by turning the thickness dial at the front (Figure 3C) and use a new razor blade for each experiment to keep the sample sterile.Move the holder base to the start position and press start.Once the tissue is sliced (Figure 3D), carefully transfer anterior slices to L-15 medium in a 30 mm Petri dish using a siliconised glass pipette or Gilson (P2 or P10). Each slice has a distinctive morphology. Slices containing the hypothalamus are thicker than more anterior slices, due to the folded neuroepithelium and the underlying mesendoderm, and have a wider neural tube than more posterior slices (Figure 3E).",
    "Transfer hypothalamus slices to Dispase for 5 min (Figure 3F); then, isolate the neural tissue by gently stroking away the adjacent mesendoderm, as above. Once freed from adjacent tissue, the neuroepithelium will constrict slightly (Figure 3G, 3G’), but the ventral midline containing the nascent hypothalamus remains distinct and can be sub-dissected with tungsten needles (Figure 3G”).Isolated hypothalamic tissue can be subjected to a wide range of further investigations, ranging from tests of function in vivo (e.g., grafting it to ectopic locations or cell dissociation for scRNA-Seq analyses) to tests of function ex vivo (e.g., neurospherogenic competence or ex vivo cultures). Here, we focus on the investigation of hypothalamic tissue explants in 3D culture systems.Tissue embedding for three-dimensional explant culture Tissue explants are a highly effective tool to investigate the extrinsic signals and tissue-intrinsic self-organising features that orchestrate hypothalamus development. They are versatile and can be used to assay patterning, proliferation, and migration. Explant cultures may consist of the entire hypothalamus or smaller, sub-dissected domains (limited by size). Good viability and the development of explants in a manner analogous to their in vivo counterparts occurs when explants are relatively small. Explants of this size can be cultured for up to seven days, after which tissue crowding and cell death begin to be observed in the explant centre. When used to assay the effects of signalling ligands or inhibitors, these factors can be added along with explant medium. Explants can be embedded in different matrices, most frequently in collagen or Matrigel. Explants are placed on a bottom layer of gelled collagen or Matrigel, then covered with a second layer, and positioned at the interface of the layers.",
    "Previous reports have provided detailed methodologies for how to embed explants in 3D matrices (Placzek and Dale, 1999; Placzek, 2008), so here we provide only brief details.For collagen:  Prepare the desired volume (25 μL/bed/well) of 90% collagen and 10% 10× DMEM in an Eppendorf and vortex for 15–20 s. Add 0.8M NaHCO3 to make the solution turn pale yellow after vortexing. Typically, 2–6 μL of NaHCO3 is added to 100 μL of collagen/10× DMEM. Collagen, if unused, should be left on ice as it will start to set at room temperature. Always make fresh batches of collagen for bottom and top layers.In a Nunc 4-well dish, prepare collagen beds by pipetting 20–25 μL of collagen, spreading it into a flatbed (Figure 4A). Allow to set (20–30 min at room temperature). Flat collagen beds are easier to embed the tissue as the tissue tends to slide off a convex bed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4898/bioprotoc-13-23-4898-g004.jpgFigure 4. Hypothalamic tissue embedding and culture. (A) Nunc 4-well dishes with Matrigel beds. (B) Single hypothalamic explant after dissection (inset) and embedding (arrow), prior to culturing. (C) Hypothalamic explants cultured after 72 h. (D) High power view of explant cultured for 72 h. Scale bar: (B, C) 250 μm, (D) 100 μm.Transfer explants onto the collagen bed using a siliconised glass pipette/appropriately sized Gilson (P2, P10, P20), position them, and remove excess medium using a fine pipette (Figure 4B). Overlay with 25 μL of collagen, spreading this to ensure it covers the bottom bed. Reposition/manipulate the explants as required while the collagen is setting. Collagen sets quickly at room temperature so work rapidly and add top collagen layer to one well at a time, providing the opportunity to reposition explants before the collagen begins to set.",
    "Allow the top collagen bed to set completely at room temperature (check by prodding the collagen with a tungsten needle; set collagen feels firm) before adding 400–500 μL of explant medium with or without factors and transfer to incubator for the desired time of incubation (Figure 4C, 4D). Routinely, we culture explants for 3 h to 7 days.For Matrigel:  Prepare desired volume (25 μL/bed/well) of 50% Matrigel and 50% explant medium in an Eppendorf and vortex for 15–20 s. If unused, Matrigel should be left on ice as it will start to set at room temperature. Always make a fresh batch of Matrigel for bottom and top beds.Proceed with steps 2–4 as above for collagen, but beds must be set by placing dish at 37 °C for a minimum of 30 min (check by prodding Matrigel with a tungsten needle; set Matrigel feels firm)."
