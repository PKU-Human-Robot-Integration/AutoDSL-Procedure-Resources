    "This protocol describes how to isolate a large number of high-quality MSCs from a human umbilical cord (about 65 million MSCs from 3 cm of umbilical cord at Passage 1). We first describe the steps for the collection and processing of the umbilical cord, and isolation of hMSCs from the cord lining membrane. We then outline the procedure for hMSC characterization (see below), cryo-preservation, thawing, and sub-culturing. The entire procedure is shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-fig-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0636485b-749a-4073-8c90-b856338329cc/cpz1423-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nSchematic representation and timing of the steps described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-prot-0001] to obtain high-quality human MSCs from human umbilical cord (UC) membrane. The substeps include: (A) human umbilical cord collection and processing, consisting of the dissection of a cord/placenta sample; (B) isolation of hMSCs from the UC lining membrane, i.e., cutting and separating the cord lining (CL) membrane from vessels and Wharton's jelly (WJ), and then chopping the CL membrane, followed by partial digestion and culturing of the tissue pieces; (C) hMSC cryopreservation; (D) characterization of hMSCs, i.e., to confirm that the resulting isolated cells are MSCs; (E) hMSC thawing and sub-culturing, consisting of MSC amplification for use in various applications. The entire procedure is shown for a single cord/placenta sample. Pictures of surface antigen expression and multilineage differentiation are adapted from Coccini et al. (2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0014]).",
    "After the cells are isolated, it is imperative to proceed to MSC characterization to determine whether the isolated cells exhibit the typical characteristics of MSCs. This is done by evaluating whether the cells meet the set of criteria proposed by the Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of the ISCT (International Society for Cellular Therapy) (Bosch et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0009]; Dominici et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0027]), and we describe the steps for this here. First, the isolated cells, during culture, should exhibit a fibroblast-like morphology. In addition, the cells must satisfy the following criteria:\n         \n(i)Adherence to plastic: MSCs must be plastic-adherent when maintained in standard culture conditions using tissue culture flasks or similar;\n(ii)Specific surface antigen (Ag) expression: 90%-95% of the MSC population must express CD105, CD73 CD90, and HLA class I, and they must lack expression (max 5%-10% positive) of CD45, CD34, CD31, CD14 or CD11b, and HLA class II;\n(iii)Multipotent differentiation potential: cells must be able to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and/or chondroblasts under standard in vitro differentiating conditions.\nCells that meet all these criteria can be designated as MSCs and then can be used for a specific project.\nMaterials\nHuman umbilical cord/placenta\nPhysiological saline solution (0.9% NaCl; PanReac AppliChem, cat. no.

Aseptically collect the sample of cord/placenta from full-term pregnant woman during elective cesarean section, after informed consent.\n2. Immediately place the sample in a collection cup containing cold physiological saline solution (0.9%NaCl) and store at 4°C until arrival at the lab. Continue to next steps within 2 hr.\nIn laboratory\n3. Transfer the cord/placenta sample to a Petri dish (150 mm) containing PBS (about 20 ml) placed on ice under laminar flow hood.\n4. Rinse the sample multiple times with ice-cold PBS using a sterile glass Pasteur pipette in order to remove blood clots.\nAll operations should be carried out on ice.\nEnsure that the sample is kept wet with PBS during processing; do not let it dry.\n5. Separate the umbilical cord (UC) from the placenta using a pair of sterile scissors.\n6. Collect the waste (placenta and cord residues) in a cup and follow your institution's biohazard disposal waste regulations.\n7. Transfer UC (approximately 3 cm in length) to a Petri dish (100 mm) placed on ice.\n8. Cut the UC longitudinally using sterile scissors and forceps (1 × 2 teeth) (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a70f813c-813f-4afa-be41-f72a758f7a9c/cpz1423-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Schematic depicting transverse (left) and longitudinal (right) sections of the human UC, comprising the Wharton's jelly, two umbilical arteries, and one umbilical vein, all of which are protected by a sheet-like membrane known as cord lining.\n9. Expose the blood vessels (vein and arteries) and the surrounding Wharton's jelly (WJ) without damaging the epithelium.\n10. Scrape the WJ away from the blood vessels and inner epithelium of the subamnion region using a scraper.\n11. Cut/remove blood vessels and discard them as indicated in step 6.\n12. Collect the outer lining membrane, the cord lining (CL), in a separate Petri dish (100 mm) placed on ice, containing PBS (5 ml). Proceed to isolate the MSCs as described below.\nIsolation of hMSCs from the cord lining membrane\n13. Discard PBS from the Petri dish containing the CL membrane using a vacuum aspiration system and add 5 ml of 1× trypsin solution.\n14. Cut CL membrane into 1- to 2-mm pieces using a pair of sterile scissors.\n15. Incubate CL pieces at 37°C for 30 min in a 5% CO2 incubator for partial digestion of samples.\n16. Monitor the partial digestion after 30 min using an inverted microscope in bright-field mode (the released cells from pieces should be visualized in the Petri dish).\n17. At the end of the enzymatic incubation, add an equal volume (5 ml) of complete DMEM medium in order to inactivate the trypsin.\n18. Transfer the suspension with pieces into a 50-ml centrifuge tube and let the partially digested tissue pieces settle for 5 min.\n19. Carefully aspirate the supernatant using a vacuum pump.\nSingle cells will also be aspirated, which is intentional, since they will not expand efficiently.",
    "20. Select CL pieces (1-2 mm only) and align them with the help of sterile forceps (toothed oval jaw): place 20 partially digested tissue pieces per 75-cm2 tissue culture flask.\nFrom one 3-cm-long UC, it is possible to prepare four flasks, each containing 20 pieces.\n21. Gently add 10 ml of MSC medium to each flask.\n22. Incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator and do not disturb the culture flasks for 2-3 days, to allow for the adherence of tissue pieces.\nNote that non-adherent tissue pieces will not give rise to any cell outgrowth until they adhere to the plastic. Care must be taken that the flask is not disturbed, in order to avoid detachment of the adherent tissue pieces.\n23. Change the MSC medium every 3-4 days and monitor for the appearance of outgrowth of cells from the explant pieces using an inverted microscope in bright-field mode.\nThe cells will look round at the beginning. With time and when confluence is reached, they will acquire their characteristic elongated shape (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6d640285-e0a6-4319-aa2e-e39c6c23910c/cpz1423-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nhMSCs at different times of culturing. Representative images (obtained using phase-contrast microscope) of cell morphology at different times during hMSC outgrowth from the explants of CL pieces, at day 3, 7, 14, and 21. hMSCs adhere completely to the bottom of culture flasks (day 3). They exhibit a round phenotype at the beginning (day 3) and then a fibroblastic-like shape with spiral and radial-like growth from day 7 to 21. When hMSCs reach high cell density (80%-90%), their morphology becomes more elongated (day 21) before detaching and expansion or cryopreservation. Scale bar: 100 µm.\n24. Let cells grow from the tissue explants until 70%-80% cell confluence is reached (about 3 weeks). At this point, the cells are considered at passage 0.",
    "25. Gently remove the medium from the 75-cm2 culture flask using a vacuum aspiration system, and wash the cells once with 5 ml of PBS.\n26. Discard the PBS and add 2 ml of Accutase solution per 75-cm2 flask in order to detach the pieces and the cells. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nRotate the flask while adding Accutase solution in order to spread it uniformly over the surface.\n27. Stop the reaction by adding 5 ml of MSC medium to each 75-cm2 flask.\n28. Pool the contents (cells + pieces + medium) of each 75-cm2 flask culture (total = 28 ml) and filter with a 100-µm sterile cell strainer to separate cells from tissue fragments into a 50-ml centrifuge tube, carefully pipetting them up and down in order to obtain a single cell suspension (without cell agglomeration) (cells at Passage 1).\n29. Take a 90-µl aliquot of the cell suspension and mix with 10 µl of 0.4% trypan blue solution in a microcentrifuge tube.\n30. Transfer 10 µl of the mix to a Burker chamber and count viable cells.\nSee Strober (2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0085]) for additional detail.\n31. Based on the number of cells obtained at this point (about 65 million cells at Passage 1), transfer 3 × 106 isolated cells to a 50-ml tube: these cells will be used for the characterization of the MSCs. Immediately cryopreserve the remaining cells (preparing cryovials at 1-1.5 × 106 cells/tube; see “Cryopreservation” below).\nIf after characterization the isolated cells are considered to meet MSC criteria, you can then use the cryopreserved cells for sub-culturing and neuronal transdifferentiation (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-prot-0002]).\nCharacterization of hMSCs\nAdherence to plastic and analysis of cell morphology",
    "32. Seed the isolated cells (cells at Passage 1) in a 75-cm2 culture flask at a density of 4000 cells/cm2 in 12 ml of MSC medium.\n33. After 3 days, when 70%-80% cell confluence is reached, observe the cells to detect whether they are attached.\n34. Monitor morphology. Cells should change towards a fibroblast-like shape/phenotype, appearing as a homogeneous monolayer of long spindle-like cells with a whirlpool like-array.\n35. If cells meet this first criterion (i.e., adherence of fibroblast-like cells to plastic), use them and proceed to the evaluation of the other two criteria below.\nSpecific surface antigen expression\n36. Use the isolated cells in the flask mentioned above (step 33).\n37. Discard the MSC medium using a vacuum aspiration system.\n38. Wash the cells once with PBS (5 ml PBS per 75-cm2 culture flask).\n39. Discard the PBS and add 2 ml of Accutase solution (incubate for 5 min at room temperature) to each flask in order to detach the cells.\nRotate the flask while adding Accutase solution, in order to spread it uniformly over the surface.\n40. Stop the reaction by adding 5 ml of MSC medium.\n41. Combine a 90-µl aliquot of the cell suspension with 10 µl of 0.4% trypan blue solution in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) and mix.\n42. Transfer 10 µl of the mix to a Burker chamber and count viable cells.\n43. Resuspend 1 × 106 cells in 1 ml of MSC medium and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube.\n44. Centrifuge the suspension 10 min at 100 × g (1000 rpm), room temperature.\n45. Remove the supernatant.\n46. Add 100 µl of cell suspension buffer (PBS containing 5% pooled human serum; HS) to the pellet",
    "47. Split cell suspension into two acquisition tubes marked as \"Tube 1\" (50 µl) and \"Tube 2\" (50 µl).\nTube 1 is for unstained cells, as negative control.\n48. Add 10 µl, from stock (as reported on product data sheet), of anti-human monoclonal antibodies specific for CD90-BV421, CD105-APC, CD73-FITC, HLA I-PE, CD34-PE, CD31-PECy7, CD14-APC-H7, CD45-V500, and HLA-DR-APC-H7 to Tube 2 (containing 50 µl of cell suspension).\n49. Incubate the cells for 30 min at 4°C.\n50. Add 1 ml of cell suspension buffer (PBS containing 5% pooled human serum; HS) to both tubes.\n51. Centrifuge the suspension 10 min at 100 × g, room temperature.\n52. Remove the supernatant.\n53. Resuspend the pellet in 400 µl of physiological saline (0.9% NaCl).\n54. Before acquisition in flow cytometer, add 5 µl of 7-AAD to both tubes.\n55. Acquire 20,000 live cells in flow cytometer.\n56. Analyze the cells by flow cytometry.\nThe test is considered acceptable if percentage of antibody-stained cells (viable) is ≥90% for CD90, CD105, CD73, HLA I, and max 10% for CD34, CD31, CD14, CD45, and HLA-DR.\nMultilineage differentiation potential: Adipogenic differentiation\n57. Use the isolated cells (at the cell confluence, described in steps 32-33 of the “adherence to plastic and analysis of cell morphology”).\n58. Discard the MSC medium using a vacuum aspiration system.\n59. Wash the cells once with PBS (5 ml PBS/75-cm2 culture flask).\n60. Discard the PBS and add 2 ml of Accutase solution (incubate for 5 min at room temperature) in order to detach the cells.\nRotate the flask while adding Accutase solution in order to spread it throughout uniformly.\n61. Stop the reaction by adding 5 ml of MSC medium.",
    "62. Combine a 90-µl aliquot of the cell suspension with 10 µl of 0.4% trypan blue solution in a microcentrifuge tube and mix.\n63. Transfer 10 µl of the mix to a Burker chamber and count viable cells.\n64. Place 17 × 103/cm2 cells in 1 ml/well of adipogenic differentiation medium in a 24-well plate (this corresponds to ∼30,000 cells/well). Incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\n65. Also use commercially available hMSCs or hMSCs that have already been tested, as a positive control for the ability to differentiate into adipocytes.\n66. Change medium twice a week.\n67. Remove medium after 3 weeks and wash twice with 500 µl/well of PBS.\n68. Add 400 µl/well of Oil red O solution.\n69. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.\n70. Remove Oil red O solution.\n71. Add 400 µl/well of 60% isopropanol and incubate at room temperature for 10 s.\n72. Remove and wash twice with 500 µl/well of PBS.\n73. Visualize the red-stained lipid droplets, indicative of adipogenic cell lineage, using an inverted microscope.\nIf no lipid droplets are visible, it means that the isolated cells did not differentiate; probably they are not hMSC, or the assay should be repeated (see Troubleshooting).\nMultilineage differentiation potential: Osteogenic differentiation\n74. Follow steps 57-63 in “Adipogenic differentiation.”\n75. Place 17 × 103 cells/cm2 in 1 ml/well of osteogenic differentiation medium in a 24-well plate (this corresponds to ∼30,000 cells/well). Incubate (at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator)\n76. Use also commercially available hMSCs or hMSCs already tested, as a positive control for the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts.\n77. Change medium twice a week.\n78. Remove medium after 3 weeks and wash with 500 µl/well of PBS.",
    "79. Add 400 µl/well of alkaline phosphatase substrate solution and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\n80. Remove solution and wash twice with PBS (500 µl/well).\n81. Add 400 µl/well of Alizarin red S solution and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\n82. Remove and wash twice with 500 µl/well of distilled water.\n83. Visualize the red staining of the calcium deposits, and violet staining for the presence of alkaline phosphatase, using an inverted microscope.\nIf no calcium deposits are visible, it means that isolated cells did not differentiate. Probably they are not hMSC, or the assay should be repeated (see Troubleshooting).\nhMSC cryo-preservation\nOnce the cells have been verified, use the remaining part of the cells/MSCs (about 60 × 106) obtained at Passage 1 and proceed to their cryopreservation using a defined, animal-component free, and protein-free cryo-SFM preservation medium, in order to store hMSCs long-term in house.\n84. Take the cell suspension from step 31 in the 50-ml tube, at Passage 1, and centrifuge 4 min at 100 × g, room temperature.\n85. Aspirate the supernatant (without disturbing the cells) from the pellet.\n86. Resuspend the cells in freezing medium at a density of 1-1.5 × 106 viable cells/ml in cryogenic vials (2 ml).\nFreezing medium (PromoCell) is based on methylcellulose, 10% DMSO, and other cryoprotectants for the cryopreservation of human primary cells. The use of this medium allows a slower cooling rate, greatly reducing the risk of ice crystal formation, which can damage cells and cause cell death.\n87. Place the cryovials, containing cells and freezing medium, in a Cryo freezing container with isopropanol (Mr. Frosty). Store Mr. Frosty at –80°C overnight.\n88. The next day, transfer the cryovials to a liquid nitrogen container and store the cells until use.",
    "Carefully follow the “Prudent Safety Practices” for safe handling and storage of liquid nitrogen (Coecke et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0017]). In particular, if using a traditional (non-automated) cryo-storage container system, and to insure the long-term maintenance of viable cryopreserved cells, you must: (1) monitor N2 level by manual measurements weekly; (2) have tanks re-filled, by qualified personnel, to retain liquid volume over time; (3) examine the tanks’ integrity daily, assessing evaporation in conjunction with physical inspection of welds, seals, or any visual anomalies.\nhMSCs thawing and sub-culturing\n89. Use one or more cryogenic vials (at P1) (depending on the number of planned experiments) for thawing and sub-culturing.\n90. Rapidly transfer a cryogenic vial containing cryopreserved hMSCs (1 ml) from the liquid nitrogen container to a 37°C water bath.\n91. Thaw cells by gentle agitation until most, but not all, of the contents are thawed.\n92. Remove the cryogenic vial from the water bath, rinse the cryovial externally with 70% ethanol solution, and then transfer it into laminar flow hood. Let the remaining cells thaw.\nMaximum cell viability depends on the rapid and complete thawing of frozen cells.\n93. Transfer the thawed hMSCs suspension (1 ml) into a sterile 15-ml tube and slowly add 4 ml of MSC medium (pre-warmed at 37°C).\nDo not add the entire volume of medium all at once to the cells. This may result in decreased cell viability due to osmotic shock. Adding the medium slowly helps avoid this stress.\n94. Gently pipette solution up and down to ensure homogenous cell distribution.\n95. Combine a 90-µl aliquot of the cell suspension with 10 µl of 0.4% trypan blue solution in a microcentrifuge tube and mix.\n96. Transfer 10 µl of the mix to a Burker chamber and count viable cells.\nCell viability is typically >95%.",
    "97. Prepare the appropriate number of flasks for your experiment with the corresponding amount of pre-warmed MSC medium (12 ml of medium/75 cm2 flask) and seed cells at a density of 4000 cells/cm2.\n98. Incubate the flask with hMSCs in a CO2 incubator at 37°C.\n99. The next day, replace MSC medium with 12 ml of fresh MSC medium (pre-warmed to 37°C).\n100. When 70%-80% cell confluence is reached (about 3-4 days after the thawing), prewarm the solutions, namely PBS and MSC medium, to 37°C for at least 30 min before starting the procedure; let Accutase solution warm at room temperature.\n101. Remove the medium using a vacuum aspiration system, and wash the cells once with 5 ml of PBS (prewarmed).\n102. Discard the PBS using a vacuum aspiration system.\n103. Add 2 ml of Accutase solution and incubate for 5 min for cell detachment.\nRotate the flask while adding Accutase solution in order to spread it throughout uniformly.\n104. Stop the reaction by adding 3 ml of MSC medium (prewarmed).\n105. Transfer the hMSCs with Accutase solution + medium to a 15-ml centrifuge tube and carefully pipette up and down to obtain a single-cell suspension (i.e., without the cell aggregation).\n106. Combine a 90-µl aliquot of the cell suspension with 10 µl of 0.4% trypan blue solution in a microcentrifuge tube and mix.\n107. Transfer 10 µl of the mix to Burker chamber and count viable MSCs.\nTotal viable hMSCs could be 10-14 × 106cells\n108. At this point, freeze a portion of the hMSCs to prepare a cell bank before initiating neuronal transdifferentiation (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-prot-0002]).

    "This protocol describes how to differentiate the hMSCs generated in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-prot-0001] into neuron-like cells (hNLCs), to establish a human primary cell in vitro model for neurotoxicity testing.\nThe transdifferentiation process into hNLCs, from undifferentiated (1 hr after induction) to the fully differentiated (8 days) stage, can be monitored by the accompanying striking changes in cell morphology, with the formation of neural dendrites and axons, and by analyzing the expression of some neuron-specific markers such as β-Tubulin III (β-Tub III), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), and enolase (NSE), although other endpoints can be evaluated.\nThe effects caused by chemicals/drugs/xenobiotics/emerging contaminants (including nanomaterials) can be assessed at various stages of the neuronal differentiation process of hMSCs, such as at the early- (at 2-3 days after induction) or mid-differentiation (at 4-5 days after induction) stages, and at fully differentiated neuron-like stages (at 8 days after differentiation).",
    "A general approach to use hNLCs for assessing developmental neurotoxicity is also described here, and is based on studying different endpoints, such as evaluating changes in neuronal morphology, cell viability, and mitochondrial function (Buzanska et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0011]; Radio & Mundy, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0073]; Shi et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0081]; Singh et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0082]). Morphological changes of the hMSCs versus a neuronal-like phenotype can be observed during different stages of the neuronal differentiation process using phase-contrast microscopy; cell viability can be evaluated through the assessment of the membrane integrity using the trypan blue exclusion test or mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity by MTT assay; mitochondrial function can be evaluated by assessing cytosolic ATP content. In addition, expression of various neuronal markers can be evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. For this, some commonly studied markers include nestin (an intermediate filament protein that is specifically found in the precursors to neuron), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, an astrocyte marker), β-Tub III (a microtubule element of the tubulin family, structural marker predominantly in neurons), MAP-2 (a mature neuron marker), NSE (cytoplasmic protein expressed by mature neurons), and SOX-2, a key transcriptional factor for pluripotent stem cell regulation and a marker for undifferentiated stem cells.\nAn outline of the workflow of this protocol is shown in Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-fig-0005].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c871f37f-6b49-4b51-bc4c-c12187e81688/cpz1423-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nSchematic representation and timing of the steps described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-prot-0002]. The substeps include: (A) induction of hMSCs to transdifferentiate into neuron-like cells, including hMSCs plating, culturing them for 72 hr, and induction; (B) Once the hNLCs are obtained, these can be used as a model for neurotoxicity testing, i.e., evaluating different endpoints such as neuronal morphology, viability, mitochondrial function, and neuronal expression markers upon treatment with test chemicals.\nMaterials\n1 mg/ml human fibronectin solution (PromoCell, cat. no.

Coat 96- or 6-well plates with a 10 µg/ml solution of human fibronectin for 1 hr at room temperature, under laminar flow hood.\nThe type of plate (96- or 6-well plates) to be coated depends on the type of test that will be conducted with the cells: use coated 96-well plates for MTT and ATP content assays, and use coated 6-well plates for trypan blue exclusion test and for immunofluorescence. The number of plates depends on the number of replicates, number of test conditions (i.e., different concentrations and/or time exposure), and number of controls (non-exposed on vehicle-treated).\nThe volume used for coating should be sufficient to cover the surface area. Coated plates can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks under sterile conditions. Leave the plates at room temperature for at least 1 hr before using.\n2. After 1 hr of incubation, remove the coating solution and let dry under laminar flow hood for 20-30 min before plating hMSCs.\n3. Thaw hMSCs from one cryopreserved vial (1 ml) (higher than Passage 1, from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-prot-0001]). To do this, follow the procedure described in steps 90-107 in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-prot-0001].\n4. Seed the hMSCs at a density of 4000 cells/cm2 using MSC medium: 2 ml of medium/well for coated 6-well plates or 100 µl of medium/well for coated 96-well plates.\n5. Incubate at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and let the hMSCs adhere until they reach 80% confluence (after 72 hr).\n6. Change the medium every 48 hr.",
    "7. When the cells reach 80% confluency, aspirate the MSC medium from each well using a vacuum aspiration system.\n8. Proceed to the neuronal transdifferentiation of hMSCs by adding 2 ml/well to the 6-well plates or 100 µl/well to the 96-well plates of neurogenic medium (prewarmed at 37°C). Incubate the cells at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for at least 3 days and then up to 8 days.\nSignificant morphological changes on cells can be observed as early as 1-2 day(s) after neuronal induction.\n9. Change the neurogenic medium every 48 hr up to 8 days (fully differentiated neuronal stage) and use the cells for testing at different time points, from day 2 (early differentiated neuronal stage) to day 8 (fully differentiated neuronal stage), depending on your experimental goals/design.\n10. Proceed with the treatment of hNLCs with the putative testing compound at different concentrations using one of these two approaches, depending on your experimental goals/design:\n         \nTreat the hMSCs at the beginning of the neuronal induction and proceed to test at selected time points of the neuronal differentiation process: e.g., at day 2 (early differentiated neuronal stage), at day 4 (mid differentiated neuronal stage), or at day 8 (fully differentiated neuron-like cells).\nor\nb.Treat hNLCs when fully differentiated (at day 8) and proceed to test after the scheduled exposure time (e.g., after 24 and 48 hr) defined in your project.\n11. Follow the next steps to evaluate the impact of toxicant exposure on the hNLCs using your endpoint of interest.\nAssessment of neurotoxicity\nCell morphology",
    "12. After exposure to a compound (with any of the approaches described in step 10), observe the cells by phase-contrast microscopy and verify whether the treatment affects the neuron-like phenotype, including the retraction of the cytoplasm towards the nucleus, cytoplasmic extensions, and loss of interaction between cells, compared to controls.\n13. Capture microscopic fields, randomly selected, using a digital camera, and store them, in order to record any morphological change.\n14. Count the number of cells exhibiting neurites and report it as the percentage compared to untreated hNLCs.\nTogether, the presence of morphological alterations and loss of neurites are used as indices of toxicity caused by the test compound.\nAs mentioned above, the number of plates depends on the number of exposure and concentration conditions under investigation. We recommend n = 2 replicates for each different endpoint.\nCell viability\n15. After treatment of the hNLCs with the test compound, evaluate cell viability using the MTT assay (Aras, Hartnett, & Aizenman, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0003]) or trypan blue exclusion (TB) test (see Current Protocols article: Strober, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.423#cpz1423-bib-0085]) according to standard procedures for each assay.\nFor the MTT assay, read the absorbance of the formazan solution derived from the viable cells (the amount of color produced is directly proportional to the number of viable cells) using a microplate spectrophotometer and evaluate if the cell viability is affected by treatments compared to controls. A reduction of cell viability indicates the degree of cytotoxicity caused by the test compound. Express the results as percentage of viable cells compared to control (untreated hNLCs).\nFor TB test, count viable cells using a hemocytometer (e.g., Burker chamber) to evaluate if the treatment reduces viable cell number. The latter indicates the cytotoxicity degree. Express the results as percentage of viable cells compared to control (untreated hNLCs).",
    "As mentioned above, the number of 96- or 6-well plates to be coated depends on how many exposure and concentrations conditions are under investigation. For MTT assay, we recommend n = 6 replicates for each different endpoint. For trypan blue exclusion test, we recommend n = 2 replicates for each different endpoint.\nMitochondrial function\n16. After exposure to a compound, evaluate mitochondrial function using a commercial kit (CellTiter-Glo® 3D reagent) and perform the assay according to the manufacturer's specifications.\nMeasure the amount of cytosolic ATP present using a microplate luminometer and evaluate if the treatment induces a cytosolic ATP decrease. A reduction of ATP content indicates the degree of cytotoxicity caused by the test compound. Express the results as percentage of control (untreated hNLCs).\nWe recommend using 96-well black/clear bottom plates and covering the clear bottom of the plate with adhesive white light-reflecting film before reading the luminescence signal, to avoid cross talk between wells.\nThe number of the 96-well plates to be coated depends on the number exposure and concentration conditions under investigation. We recommend n = 6 replicates for each different endpoint.\nNeuronal expression markers\n17. After exposure to a compound, aspirate the neurogenic medium from each well of the 6-well plates containing hNLCs and wash once with PBS (2 ml/well).\nThe number of 6-well plates to be coated depends on of the number of exposure and concentration conditions under investigation, and the number of markers to assess. We recommend assessing a range of neuronal markers that cover from early to mature stage. We recommend n = 2 replicates for each condition.\n18. Discard PBS and proceed to fix the hNLCs with the addition of 4% PF (2 ml/well) for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "19. Remove PF and permeabilize for 5 min using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS.\n20. Rinse three times with PBS (2 ml/well).\n21. Block using 2% dry milk in PBS (2 ml/well) for 30 min at room temperature.\n22. Remove the blocking solution, then:\n         \nFor direct immunofluorescence: Incubate cells with the Alexa-Fluor®488 or 594 or Cy3 conjugated primary antibodies against: β-Tub III (1:100), MAP-2 (1:100), NSE (1:100), nestin (1:100), and SOX-2 (2 µg/ml) (all diluted in blocking solution) for 60 min in the dark (using aluminum foil to cover the plate) on an orbital shaker at room temperature.\nIf you use antibodies with different emission wavelengths, you can use different ones in the same well: for example, human β-Tub III antibody conjugated to Alexa-Fluor® 488 and nestin conjugated to Cy3 can be added in the same well, since the emission wavelength of each antibody is different (the emission for β-Tub III is green, while that for nestin is red). In this case, it is possible to differentiate the two protein expression profiles. On the contrary, since human antibodies β-Tub III conjugated to Alexa-Fluor® 488 and SOX2 conjugated to Alexa-Fluor® 488 have the same emission wavelength, each of them should be added to cells in different wells.\nFor indirect immunofluorescence: Incubate cells with a primary antibody against GFAP (1:100) overnight at 4°C (in a humidity chamber) and then wash three times with PBS (2 ml/well), for 5 min each time. Stain with secondary antibody (Alexa-Fluor® 488-labeled; dilution 1:100) for 60 min in the dark (using aluminum foil to cover the plate) on an orbital shaker at room temperature.\n23. After incubation with conjugated primary or secondary antibodies, wash three times (5 min each washing) with PBS (2 ml/well).",
    "24. Remove PBS and then stain the nuclei using 1 ml/well of Hoechst 33258 5 µM solution for 10 min at room temperature.\n25. Wash twice with PBS (2 ml/well) and remove it.\n26. For each well, mount with Fluoroshield (two drops/well) and then cover well with a coverglass and let dry.\nWhen using Fluoroshield, avoid air bubbles trapped under the coverglass (air bubbles can generate noise in the images captured). Place the coverglass on its edge over the well and carefully lower the coverslip into place (well) using forceps. This method will help prevent air bubbles from being trapped under the coverglass.\n27. Visualize immunostaining using a fluorescent microscope equipped with oil-immersion objective (100×) lens using appropriate filters.\n28. Capture, using a digital camera, randomly selected microscopic fields, store them, and analyze the fluorescence signal using imaging software. A decrease in fluorescence signal, compared to that evidenced in control, indicates the degree of toxicity caused by the test compound.\nIn the control sample, the expression of β-Tub III, MAP-2, and NSE (fully differentiated neuronal markers) increase gradually from early (2-3 days) and mid-differentiated (4-5 days) to fully differentiated neuronal-like cells (8 days) in the hMSC transdifferentiation process, whereas SOX-2, GFAP, and nestin display increased levels at undifferentiated and early stages of the neuronal transdifferentiation process, followed by their downregulation on fully differentiated neuron-like cells. Based on the data obtained for the control samples, verify whether the treatments affect the expression of these neuronal markers."
