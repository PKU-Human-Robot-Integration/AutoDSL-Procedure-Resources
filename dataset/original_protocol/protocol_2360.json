    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPooled lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 chemical genetic screens\nTiming: ∼2–3 weeks\nThis step involves transduction of the CRISPR-Cas9 library into a Cas9-expressing cell line of choice and screening these cells in the context of treated (compound) vs. untreated conditions. Before beginning the screen, an appropriate number of cells are seeded to ensure >1000× coverage of each sgRNA in the library. Lentiviral infection of the cell line is performed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2 (∼1 in 5 cells will have one guide RNA). The library plasmid vector contains a puromycin resistance cassette, enabling puromycin selection of cells that have integrated a guide RNA. At T0, cells are split into treated vs. untreated conditions, with 3 technical replicates per condition. From T0 to T18, cells are pelleted every 3 days and passaged with fresh compound/medium.\nCritical: The length of the screen and the frequency of cell passages depends on the doubling time of your cell line and the aimed representation of the sgRNA library. Adjust the timeline for collecting cell pellets accordingly. For example, if you have a rapidly dividing cell line, you may want to harvest cells at earlier timepoints.\nCalculate number of cells to seed for screen.\nDetermine number of cells required at T0.\nMultiply number of library guides, desired coverage, number of replicates, and number of conditions.\nExample: Library of ∼3,000 guides ∗ 1000× coverage ∗ 2 “experiments” (one DMSO control, one compound) ∗3 technical replicates = 18 million cells required at T0.\nDetermine number of cells needed at the lentiviral transduction step.\nThe calculation from step 1.a.ii. denotes number of cells present AFTER puromycin selection.",
    "At a MOI of 0.2, 1 in 5 cells will have a library plasmid with a puromycin resistance cassette. Multiply the result from step 1.a.ii. by 5.\nExample: 18 million cells ∗ 5 = 90 million cells required at lentiviral transduction step.\nUsing the doubling rate of the cell line, approximate the seeding density of cells ∼24 h before lentiviral transduction (∼48 million cells).\nCritical: We reason that seeding 3 million RPE-1 cells per 15-cm plate and propagating them every three days will provide us sufficient coverage (1000×) while also avoiding cell overgrowth. Overgrowing non-transformed cells will lead to contact inhibition and potential cell cycle arrest, which will significantly confound the identification of gene dropouts, especially when screening with a DDR-focused sgRNA library. Carefully determining the cells needed, seeding density, and the duration of propagation will ensure the robustness of the screen.\nCritical: Use a low multiplicity of infection, or MOI, to decrease the likelihood of cells getting more than one sgRNA integration.\nDay -T4: Seeding Cells.\nSeed total number of cells (48 million cells) determined in step 1. For this cell line, aim for a seeding density of 3 million cells per 15-cm cell culture plate with 20 mL DMEM:F12 medium (16 plates total).\nThe seeding density can vary here; however, aim to never exceed 70% confluence by the time of lentiviral transduction of the library.\nSeed 3 million cells in a separate plate, which will act as a control for the puromycin selection.\nDay -T3: Lentiviral Transduction of CRISPR library.\nCalculate the total volume of lentivirus stock needed to deliver the packaged lentiviral library at a MOI of 0.2 using the following titer formula:\nTU/mL = (number of cells at transduction) × [MOI / (mL of lentiviral stock used at transduction)]",
    "Divide the total volume of lentivirus stock by the number of total plates to obtain the volume of lentivirus stock needed for each plate.\nPrepare conical tubes containing 40 mL of fresh medium for every 2 plates of cells you plan to infect. Add the volume of lentivirus stock for 2 plates and polybrene to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. Mix by inverting tubes.\nRetrieve plates from the incubator. Gently remove the medium.\nGently add 20 mL of the lentivirus mixture prepared in step 3.b into each plate. Do not disturb cells on the plate. For the control plate, add fresh medium (without lentivirus).\nDay -T2: Puromycin Selection.\nRemove medium 24 h after transduction. Wash cells with PBS twice. Add 3 μg/mL∗ puromycin to the transduced plates and to the control plate in fresh medium. Cells in the control plate should all die over the next 48–72 h. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for additional information.\n∗Perform a puromycin experiment prior to the screen with the cell line of choice to determine the dosage required to kill all cells in 48–72 h. It is important to perform this experiment in the same tissue culture conditions (15-cm plates) as what will be used in the screen.\nDay T0: Split cells into control vs. compound treatment screens. Collect T0 pellets.\nRemove the medium from each plate. Gently wash plates with warm PBS.\nTrypsinize and pool cells from all plates into one sterile container.\nSpin cell pellet down at 300 × g for 5 min.\nDetermine the number of “conditions”, or screens being performed. Each batch of compound screens requires at least one vehicle control screen (DMSO).\nFor example, to screen one compound and one DMSO control, we have 2 screens ∗ 3 technical replicates = 6 “conditions”",
    "Start screen: Split the cell pellet from step 5.c. into “conditions”.\nFor each “condition”, seed 3 million cells per 15 cm-plate to maintain 1000× representation of the library.\nT0 sample collection: Split leftover cell pellet from step 5.c. into T0 cell pellets.\nCollect 3× T0 cell pellets in 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes, each containing 4 million cells. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Remove supernatant and wash the cells with 1× PBS once. Aspirate PBS and leave pellet half-covered in PBS (so pellet does not dry out). Store at −80°C.\nCritical: Aim to collect more cells than needed to account for the downstream loss.\nAdd the appropriate volume of vehicle control (DMSO) or compound to each plate.\nCompound dosage is determined above in the “Determine compound concentrations” section.\nAdd the equivalent volume of DMSO for the control screen. Ensure that the concentration of DMSO does not exceed 0.5% w/v.\nTransfer volume of cell suspension for 3 million cells into 50 mL conical tubes and bring up the volume to 20 mL with fresh medium. Add the compound/DMSO. Mix well by inverting 5×. Transfer to a 15 cm plate.\nCritical: If the compound dosage is too high, you may have difficulty collecting enough cells per pellet. Think about expanding how many plates are used per condition.\nDay T3-T18: Collect cell pellets every 3 days.\nPassage cells every 3 days and add compound/DMSO as in the previous step.\nTrypsinize cells from each replicate. Do not pool all replicates together (i.e., keep each replicate as an independent lineage).\nSeed 3 million cells in compound/DMSO containing medium as in step 5.g.\nCollect 4 million cells and freeze pellets at −80°C at each passage.",
    "Pelleting more cells (4 million instead of 3 million) than the 1000× representation buffers for loss during downstream genomic DNA processing.\nWash the cells with 1× PBS once. Spin down the cell pellet and aspirate 1× PBS. Store at −80°C.\nIf possible, collect more pellets than needed.\nWe empirically found that T12 and T18 results do not differ by much. Sequencing pellets from T3-T12 allows us to differentiate between acute and chronic responses to compounds.\nGenomic DNA extraction\nTiming: ∼1–2 days\nIn this step, genomic DNA is extracted from frozen cell pellets using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit[href=https://www.promega.com/resources/protocols/technical-manuals/0/wizard-genomic-dna-purification-kit-protocol/] (Promega, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The extracted DNA will be used as template DNA in the subsequent two-round PCR step. This protocol is adapted from the Promega kit protocol and optimized for 0.5–5 × 106 cells.\nBefore starting this step, prepare the following:\nEnsure a sufficient amount of all buffers for the number of samples being processed.\nMake 70% ethanol solution using nuclease-free water.\nSet the heat block to 65°C.\nPre-warm nuclease-free water to 65°C.\nAll centrifugation steps are performed at 4°C.\nUse filtered pipette tips for all steps to avoid contamination of genomic DNA.\nGenomic DNA Extraction using Promega Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit.\nThaw cell pellets at 22°C for 5 min.\nAdd 200 μL PBS to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube containing the cell pellet. Vortex for 20 s to resuspend cells and rest for 1 min. If required, pipette 15× with P200 pipette to break remaining cell clumps.\nAdd 600 μL Nuclei Lysis Solution to the resuspended cells. Pipette mixture 5× using a P1000 pipette to mix.",
    "Add 4 μL RNase A (20 mg/mL), to a final concentration of 100 μg/mL, to the nuclear lysate and mix the sample by inverting the tube 5×. Incubate the mixture at 37°C for 15 min and cool to 22°C (∼2 min).\nAdd 200 μL Protein Precipitation Solution to the nuclear lysate and vortex vigorously for 20 s. Incubate the mixture on ice for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nThe supernatant layer containing DNA should separate from the solid white protein layer. If not, centrifuge again at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, transfer the supernatant (∼900 μL) to a 1.5-mL microfuge tube containing 600 μL isopropanol.\nAvoid transfer of protein. If necessary, use a P200 pipette, aim the tip against the side of the tube wall, and carefully go down the wall to pick up supernatant from the top.\nGently mix the solution 50× by inversion until the white thread-like strands of DNA form a visible mass.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The DNA will be visible as a small white pellet. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for additional information.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, carefully remove supernatant, leaving ∼10 μL. Remove remaining supernatant with a P20 pipette to avoid dislodging pellets.\nAdd 600 μL 70% ethanol to the DNA. Gently rotate the tube to wash the DNA pellet and the sides of the microfuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, carefully remove 70% ethanol. Spin tube and remove remaining ethanol with P20 pipette. Air-dry genomic DNA for 10 min at 22°C under the fume hood.",
    "Add 50 μL–100 μL nuclease-free water to the tube, depending on the number of cells used in the purification. Let DNA dissolve by incubating at 65°C for 1 h, rotating at 300 rpm.\nAlternatively, pre-warm nuclease-free water at 65°C, add to DNA pellets and leave at 22°C for 18–24 h.\nQuantitate DNA and measure purity by spectrophotometry (using a Nanodrop), and store at −20°C.\nCritical: If genomic DNA is too concentrated and too viscous, add more nuclease-free water to dilute it. A highly concentrated and non-homogenous DNA solution will result in inaccurate DNA concentration when using Nanodrop. If the DNA concentration is too diluted for downstream applications, concentrate DNA by ethanol precipitation and dissolve DNA in a smaller volume of nuclease-free water. Genomic DNA concentrations ranging from 500-1000 ng/μL are needed for downstream PCR amplification.\nOptional: Ethanol precipitation of genomic DNA.\nBring the volume of genomic DNA to 100 μL by adding nuclease-free water.\nAdd 4 μL 5 M NaCl and 200 μL of 100% ethanol to DNA.\nMix the sample by inverting the tube 5×.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, carefully remove supernatant, leaving ∼10 μL. Remove remaining supernatant with P20 pipette to avoid dislodging the pellet.\nAdd 200 μL 70% ethanol to the DNA. Gently rotate the tube to wash the DNA pellet and the sides of the microfuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, carefully remove 70% ethanol. Spin tube and remove remaining ethanol with P20 pipette. Air-dry genomic DNA for 10 min at 22°C under the fume hood.\nCalculate genomic DNA yield based on Nanodrop measurement from the previous step and determine the optimal concentration and volume to resuspend the DNA.",
    "Let DNA dissolve by incubating at 65°C for 1 h. Mix DNA by gently rotating at 300 rpm.\nQuantitate DNA by Nanodrop, and store at −20°C.\nTwo-round PCR\nTiming: ∼1–2 days\nIn this step, two-round PCR is performed on the genomic DNA template for each sample. The first round PCR enriches the sgRNA regions in the genome. The second round amplifies the sgRNA, reduces genomic DNA carryover into the next-generation sequencing (NGS) step, adds multiplex identifier barcodes, and adds p5/p7 sequences that are complementary to the immobilized primers in the NGS Illumina Flow Cells.\nThis protocol is adapted from the Cellecta “NGS Prep Kit for sgRNA, shRNA, and DNA Barcode Libraries[href=https://manuals.cellecta.com/ngs-prep-kit-for-sgrna-shrna-dna-barcode-libraries/v1/en/topic/procedure-overview]” manual.\nBefore starting:\nOrder the NGS prep kit for sgRNA libraries (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) from Cellecta.\nIn this kit, 12 NRev Index primers (reverse 2nd round primers) each contain a different index sequence which will be used to deconvolute multiplex sequencing results for samples mixed together in the same sequencing lane.\nIf more index primers are needed, order a supplemental kit (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), which contains an additional 12 NRev Index primers. With this kit, a maximum of 24 samples can be sequenced on the same lane.\nPlease refer to the Cellecta manual that comes with these kits to find the primer/index sequences.\nWipe the workbench with 10% bleach to prevent contamination.\nFirst Round PCR.\nAssuming the diploid genome is ∼6.5 pg, 20 μg of genomic DNA yields 1000-fold coverage of our custom library.\nFor each sample, set up a 1st round PCR as follows. Include the original plasmid library (1 ng) as a positive control. Include a negative control without genomic DNA to ensure no DNA contamination.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1995_16.csv",
    "Note: ∗We have empirically determined that a 50 μL PCR reaction is sufficient to amplify 20 μg of genomic DNA. This PCR reaction requires genomic DNA concentration to be higher than 500 ng/μL (see step 8.o). If more genomic DNA is needed to achieve coverage for different sizes of sgRNA library, split genomic DNA into multiple PCR reactions for one sample. Do not exceed 50 μg of genomic DNA in a 100 μL PCR reaction.\nNote: #The primer sequences can be found in the Cellecta NGS prep kit manual.\nOptional: To check the quality of genomic DNA before 1st round PCR, run 1 μL of the genomic DNA for each sample on a 1% agarose gel. The presence of smears on the gel may point to sample contamination or degradation and reduce the yield of each subsequent PCR reaction.\nAmplify reactions in a thermocycler using the following cycling conditions. Visualize the first round PCR products (∼477 bp) on a 2% agarose gel before proceeding to the second round PCR (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1995-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. First and second round PCR products. PCR products obtained from timepoints T0 and T3 are resolved on 2% agarose gels\nAt each timepoint, three replicates are shown for the DMSO vehicle control and Compound X screen. Positive (1 ng of plasmid library) and negative (no template DNA) PCR controls are included.\n(A) First round PCR. Note that all of the genomic DNA samples show an expected band at 477 bp with smears. Smears are likely due to the degradation of genomic DNA during PCR.\n(B) Second round PCR. Note that genomic DNA smear is not observed in the second round PCR. The two-step PCR improves the specificity of the expected product at 383 bp for downstream NGS analysis.",
    "Critical: The first round PCR product may appear as a smear on the gel and may or may not show a specific band. The smear is likely due to the degradation of the template DNA, rather than non-specific annealing of the primers. Continue using the first round PCR product as a template for the second round PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1995_17.csv\nSecond Round PCR.\nSet up the second round PCR as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1995_18.csv\nNote: #The primer sequences can be found in the Cellecta NGS prep kit manual. The 6-bp index barcode sequences can also be found in the manual.\nInclude the original plasmid library (1 ng) as a positive control. Include a negative control without genomic DNA to ensure no DNA contamination.\n∗Master Mix is prepared without these components. Each sample must use a different Index Primer to enable multiplexing in the single next-generation sequencing lane.\nAmplify reactions in a thermocycler using the following cycling conditions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1995_19.csv\nRun 5 μL of PCR2 product on a 2% agarose gel. Visualize the PCR product on a gel imager. PCR2 yields a product of 383 bp (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). All samples should have similar yields, if not, see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nDNA samples can be stored at −20°C at this stage.\nPreparation for next-generation sequencing (NGS)\nTiming: ∼1 day\nTo maximize sequencing of sgRNAs and minimize background sequences, purify the amplified PCR products by preparative gel electrophoresis.\nPCR Purification.\nPurify and concentrate the PCR products from each sample using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.qiagen.com/cn/resources/download.aspx?id=e0fab087-ea52-4c16-b79f-c224bf760c39&lang=en]. Samples should be eluted in a volume of ∼30 μL.\nAfter purifying/concentrating, run each purified PCR product with a 6× loading buffer on a 2% agarose-1XTAE gel.",
    "Use a blue transilluminator and scalpel to excise the narrow band corresponding to the correct target sgRNA amplicon size. Be sure to use UV safety glasses to protect your eyes.\nGel Extraction.\nAfter excision, purify each PCR product from the gel fragment using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.qiagen.com/cn/resources/download.aspx?id=a72e2c07-7816-436f-b920-98a0ede5159a&lang=en]. Samples should be eluted in a volume of ∼20 μL.\nNote: Centrifuge QIAquick columns at maximum speed for >3 min before eluting DNA to avoid ethanol contamination in the purified PCR product.\nQuantify extracted DNA by NanoDrop and adjust concentrations in all samples to 10 nM. Samples can be stored at −20°C at this stage.\nRun eluted samples in a final 2% agarose-1XTAE gel to check if product size is correct.\nSamples are now ready for next-generation sequencing.\nGuidelines for Sample Submission for Sequencing.\nResulting samples can be sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 550 (standard Single-Read (SR) 50-cycles). Other sequencing instruments can be used. Contact a sequencing facility to determine if the sequencer meets your requirements.\nContact a sequencing facility to inquire about sample preparation (including PhiX spike-in, library denaturation, etc.).\nSubmit all samples (10 nM each), as well as the “Seq NGS Primer” and “Index NGS Primer” from the Cellecta kit.\nNGS Quality Control.\nThe following quality control steps (or similar methods) are performed by a core sequencing facility and will ensure high quality library preparations before committing to next-generation sequencing.\nDNA quantification – Use the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay to quantify sample library preparations (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Samples must be above 2 nM to proceed with sequencing.",
    "High resolution electrophoresis – Use an Agilent Bioanalyzer (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to produce Agilent traces. These traces provide sample intensity peaks to ensure that samples are at the correct amplicon size. If adapter dimers are discovered, see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for additional sample cleanup.\nPool equimolar amounts of all samples to be sequenced in one sequencing lane for a final pooled sample concentration of 2.5 nM.\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation – Perform Kapa qPCR (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) on pooled samples. Concentration should exceed 2 nM. If lower than 2 nM, consider re-pooling samples or submitting individual library preps at higher concentration for re-pooling.\nEach pool was clustered at 1.5 pM with 10% Phi-X spike for diversity.\nEach pool was then sequenced in a lane of the Illumina NextSeq550, Mid-output 1×150-bp run.\nNGS data quality control.\nAfter the sequencing run, the sequencing facility will generate quality control plots (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1995-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Next-generation sequencing data quality control (QC) plots\nRepresentative Illumina NextSeq 550 QC data. Three replicates of the DMSO vehicle control and Compound X screen from T0 and T3 are shown.\n(A) The number of reads per sample. Note that each sample has more than 3 million reads, which is the expected read counts for the 1000× coverage of the custom sgRNA library.\n(B) The mean base quality score for each position. The higher the score, the better the base call. Note that the sgRNA position is between 20-40 bp, which show very good quality in all samples. Green: very good quality (>Q28); yellow: reasonable quality (Q20-Q28); red: poor quality (<Q20).\nAt 1000× coverage, we would expect 3 million reads per sample for this custom sgRNA library. Our collected samples exceeded this coverage (3.8–8 million reads, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).",
    "The mean base quality score is defined as Q = -10∗log10(e), where e is the estimated probability of the base call being wrong. This score is plotted for each sample along each position in the 150 bp read (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). The sgRNA sequence is located between 20–40 bp. Across all samples, the quality score at the sgRNA position is extremely high (above Q28).\nGenerate read count data and screen quality control\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this section, we describe a step-by-step approach to generating raw read counts, depth-normalized read counts, and log2-fold change values for each sgRNA in the custom library. We also describe quality control metrics for these screens, including evaluation of replicate correlation and essential gene dropout. The code used to run these steps can be found here[href=https://github.com/linx1048/STAR_protocol]. Example data for one screen (Bortezomib) is provided to illustrate this example.\nGenerating raw read counts (performed by institutional informatics experts).\nNext-generation sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 550 instrument at an institutional genomics center. The resulting sequencing data (base call files, or .bcl files) were demultiplexed and converted into zipped fastq files using bcl2fastq v2.0.\nNext, the Cellecta NGS Demultiplexing and Alignment Software was used to extract raw read counts from fastq files. Detailed instructions can be found here[href=https://manuals.cellecta.com/ngs-prep-kit-for-sgrna-shrna-dna-barcode-libraries/v1/en/topic/demultiplex-and-align-sequencing-reads]. The software requires 3 input files:\nFASTQ files (in .fastq or .fastq.gz format).\nSample Description File (matching multiplex tag to sample ID).\nLibrary Configuration File (describing guide sequences).\nThe software outputs a guide abundance table for each sample (column) and each sgRNA (row).\nConverting to depth-normalized read counts.\nThe following steps can be run using the “analysis.Rmd” file found here[href=https://github.com/linx1048/STAR_protocol]. All raw reads are converted to normalized reads by performing the following:",
    "Each raw read count is normalized by the sequencing depth (total number of reads) for each sample/barcode (column).\nNext, the value from the previous step is multiplied by a scaling factor (1 million).\nFinally, we add a pseudo-count of 1 to the value from the previous step and take log base 2 to produce the final log-normalized read count.\nCalculating log2-fold change (LFC) values.\nTo measure whether a guide has been enriched or depleted at a certain time point relative to T0, we first average the T0 replicate log-normalized read counts.\nNext, we subtract the log-normalized T0 counts from the log-normalized counts at each timepoint. This produces a log2-fold change (LFC) value for each guide at each timepoint (relative to T0).\nScreen quality control.\nReplicate correlation: by manually selecting a desired screen of interest (e.g., DMSO) and time point (e.g., T12), we can generate scatterplots of LFCs between replicates and calculate a Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC). Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] shows an example scatterplot and PCC values for the T12 DMSO sample. PCC values above 0.8 are typically expected.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1995-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Replicate correlation plots\nReplicate correlation plots were generated for T12 DMSO replicates (A, B, C). Representative scatterplots of log2-fold changes (LFCs) between two replicates are shown on the lower panels (left of diagonal). Pearson’s correlation coefficients (PCC) are displayed on the upper panel (right of diagonal).",
    "Essential gene dropout recovery: using a core essential gene standard (Hart et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), we identified 35 essential genes in this custom targeted library. Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we can quantify essential gene recovery in these screens (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). An area under the curve (AUC) should range from 0.5 (random classification) to 1 (perfect classification of essential genes as true positive dropouts). AUC values should generally be higher at later time points.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1995-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. ROC curve for essential gene dropout recovery\n35 core essential genes (Hart et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) were found in the custom library. To determine if these essential genes drop out as expected, we generate a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve representing classification of core essential genes. Along varying thresholds of LFC values, we generate false positive rates (1-specificity) and true positive rates (sensitivity) for this classification problem. This example ROC curve for the T12 DMSO sample has an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.86."
