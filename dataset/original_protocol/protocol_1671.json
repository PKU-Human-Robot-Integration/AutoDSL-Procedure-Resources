    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nC. elegans culture and lysate preparation\nTiming: 3 days\nSynchronized L1-staged C. elegans were grown on NGM plates spotted with 300 μL of OP50 E. coli at 20°C for 24 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). >200 6-cm NGM plates (200 worms/plate) were prepared.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1229-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic overview of C. elegans culture and sample preparation\nNote: >40,000 worms are needed for each treatment.\nNote: Synchronize L1 worms: suspend gravid adult worms by pouring 5 mL M9 buffer into each NGM plate, transfer the worms into 15 mL tube, pellet by centrifugation at 2000×g for 1 min and rinse with M9 buffer for three times by inverting the tube. Then, freshly prepare 10 mL of bleach solution, add into the 15 mL tube with pelleted worms, invert the tube for 5 mins on a rocker, pellet the released eggs by centrifugation at 1000×g for 1 min, discard the supernatant, and add M9 buffer to wash the pelleted eggs for three times. Lastly, allow these eggs hatch for 16 hours in 5 mL of M9 to generate synchronized L1-staged worms by placing them on a rocker at 20°C.\nNote: The worm counting process: pellet the synchronized L1-staged worms by centrifugation at 2000×g for 2 min and remove the supernatant to make the final volume to 3 mL.Then, mix the worms on vortex for 5 seconds, aspirate 2.5 μL of the liquid from the tube, drop the liquid on a slide and count the worms’ number under a dissection microscope. Repeat the process three times to get the average number of worms. Based on the number of worms needed, the corresponding volume of liquid containing L1-staged worms is added to the NGM plates.",
    "Suspend these worms grown on NGM with a 5 mL M9 buffer per plate, transfer to a 50 mL tube, pellet by centrifugation at 2000×g for 5 min. Resuspend the pelleted worms with 5 mL S-medium, transfer them by pipetting to a 500 mL conical flask, add 40 mL concentrated bacteria, add more S-medium to make the final volume 400 mL containing either ethanol or 60 μM myristic acid alkyne, and culture the worms by placing the flask on a shaker (150 rpm/min) at 20°C for 36 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCritical: Culture C. elegans with 1000–3000 worms per 1 mL of liquid medium. High worm density will lead to uneven growth of C. elegans or dauer formation.\nCritical: Add about 100 μL concentrated OP50 E. coli per 1 mL S medium. C. elegans would be starved if there are not enough bacteria. Culture with too much OP50 E. coli causes worm death. Monitor food consumption and add food when needed.\nCritical: Change the medium containing bacteria food and either 60 μM myristic acid alkyne or ethanol solvent every 12 h.\nCritical: 60–100 μM myristic acid alkyne works the best in our hands. Culture with high concentration (>120 μM) of myristic acid alkyne causes worm death.\nC. elegans were pelleted and washed with M9 for 3 times (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: C. elegans were directly poured into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, centrifuged at 2000×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. 20 mL M9 was added for washing, centrifuged at 2000×g for 5 min, and repeated for 3 times.\nPause point: The worm pellet can be stored at −80°C for a month. The frozen worm pellet is thawed on ice when proceeding to the next step.",
    "Suspend the pelleted worms with 2 mL lysis buffer (pH=8.0) (200 mM Tris, 4% CHAPS, 1 M NaCl, 8 M Urea and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor), transfer them to a 15 mL tube and then sonicate at 4°C until the worms are completely broken and dissolved. Centrifugate the worm lysate at 10,000×g for 5 min at 4°C and collect the supernatant. Aspirate a fraction of the supernatant (200 μg proteins) to a 2-mL tube for detecting the alkyne myristic acid incorporation efficiency (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and use the rest of the supernatant for enriching myristoylated proteins.\nNote: Sonicate (Sonics, VCX150) the worms at 35% amplitude for 3 seconds, followed by a rest period for 4 seconds. Usually, the worms would be completely broken after 4 minutes of sonication. The bottom of the 15-mL tube containing worms was inserted into a water bath filled with ice to prevent the sample from over-heat.\nCritical: Make sure there is no EDTA contamination in the solution, which inactivates click reaction.\nEvaluation of incorporation efficiency of myristic acid alkyne\nNote: Before proceeding to attach myristoylated proteins to the beads by click chemistry, a small amount of worm lysate was analyzed to determine if myristate alkyne was incorporated to modify proteins successfully. Click-&-GoTM Click Chemistry Reaction Buffer Kit (Cat# 1001, Click Chemistry Tools) was used to detect proteins modified by myristate alkyne through western blot.\nOptional: All the reagents can be prepared manually.\nTiming: 2 days\nClick reaction\nMix 110 μL Reaction Buffer containing 40 μM azide biotin with 50 μL worm lysate (about 200 μg proteins) at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 20 μL Additive 1 (82mM Tris-amine in H2O) and mix thoroughly on the vortex for 30s.\nAdd 20 μL Copper (II) Sulfate Solution (20mM Copper (II) Sulfate in H2O) and mix thoroughly on the vortex for 30s.",
    "Add 10 μL Reducing Agent (0.2 g/L Sodium L-ascorbate in H2O) to make the final reaction volume to 210 μL, mix thoroughly on the vortex for 30s. The reaction was carried out in darkness and samples were rotated end-over-end for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nProtein precipitation\nAfter clicking chemistry, add 600 μL 100% methanol and mix on vortex for 5 s.\nAdd 150 μL 100% chloroform and mix on vortex for 30 s.\nAdd 400 μL ddH2O and mix on the vortex for 30 s.\nCentrifuge at 15,000×g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C, carefully discard the upper water phase using a pipette and keep the middle protein layer and the bottom chloroform.\nCritical: Do not disturb the interface layer containing proteins.\nNote: When adding chloroform, it should be performed in the fume hood to avoid inhalation or skin contact.\nAdd 450 μL 100% methanol, mix thoroughly with vortex, centrifuge at 15,000×g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C, remove the chloroform and methanol supernatant and keep the precipitated proteins. Repeat this step 2 times.\nOpen the lid of the tubes and let them dry at 20°C–25°C in a chemical hood for at least 15 min. The precipitated proteins can be immediately used for the next step or stored at −20°C for at least one month or at −80°C for at least three months.\nWestern blot analysis\nAdd 50 μL 1 x SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer to the protein precipitate, and mix on vortex for 30 min.\nHeat the sample in a metal bath at 70°C for 10 min or in a water bath at 100°C for 5 min, centrifuge at 10,000×g for 1 min and load 5 μL (5–20 μg proteins) of the samples into the SDS-PAGE gel (GenScript, Cat# M42010C).",
    "Run the SDS-PAGE gel and analyze it with western blot by using streptavidin-HRP (a dilution of 1:2000) to detect the myristic acid alkyne signals from the proteins. Actin antibody (a dilution of 1:3000) was used to determine the loading amount. The expected result was shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1229-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Metabolic labeling of proteins with myristic acid alkyne in C. elegans\nWestern blot indicating that proteins modified by myristic acid alkyne are detected. C. elegans were harvested and analyzed as depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Specifically, protein lysates were obtained from C. elegans supplemented with myristic acid alkyne or ethanol control, and then azide biotin was attached to proteins modified by myristic acid alkyne after click chemistry. Streptavidin-HRP was used to probe the labeling efficiency. Actin showing that total proteins loading amount is equal between different treatments.\nNote: Block with 5% BSA at 20°C–25°C.\nPreparation of azide agarose beads\nTiming: 30 min\nNote: These steps were performed according to the Click-&-GoTM Plus Protein Enrichment Kit (Cat#1235, Click Chemistry Tools) with minor modifications.\nResuspend the azide agarose beads and then quickly transfer 200 μL of them into a clean 2-mL tube.\nAlternatives: Appropriate magnetic beads attached with azide (Cat# 1036, Click Chemistry Tools) can also be used used.\nAdd 1.3 mL ddH2O and wash the beads by manually inverting the tube 10 times, and pellet by centrifugation at 1000×g for 2 min at 20°C–25°C. Repeat the step twice.\nNote: Be careful not to aspirate the precipitated beads.\nPreparing copper (II) catalyst solution\nNote: The solution was prepared as described in the Click-&-GoTM Plus Protein Enrichment Kit (Cat#1235, Click Chemistry Tools).\nTiming: 20 min\n1 mL of copper (II) catalyst solution was used for each enrichment reaction, and was prepared as follows:\n860 μL sterilized ddH2O",
    "100 μL Additive 1 (82mM Tris-amine in H2O) (Component D)\n20 μL Copper (II) Sulfate solution (100mM Copper (II) Sulfate in H2O) (Component B)\n20 μL Reducing Agent (80g/L Sodium L-ascorbate in H2O) (Component C)\nAlternatives: The kit is not necessary, and the solutions can be manually made.\nCritical: Make sure the reducing agent is excessive.\nInvert to mix copper catalyst solution briefly\nLinking alkyne-myristate modified proteins to the azide beads via click reaction\nTiming: 1 day\nMix 200 μL washed azide agarose beads, 800 μL C. elegans protein lysate (about 3 mg protein) and 1000 μL copper (II) catalyst solution in a 2 mL tube. For each treatment, three such 2-mL reactions were needed. The samples were set on a rotator for thorough mixing and the click reaction was carried out at 20°C–25°C for 20 h.\nNote: Seal the tube with parafilm to prevent solution leak.\nProteins bound to agarose beads were reduced and alkylated\nTiming: 4 h\nNote: The experiment was performed based on the manufacturer's manual with minor changes. https://clickchemistrytools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/info-sheet-1235.pdf[href=https://clickchemistrytools.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/info-sheet-1235.pdf]\nOptional: the reagents also can be manually prepared.\nPellet agarose beads by centrifugation at 1000×g for 2 min, discard the supernatant, add 1.8 mL sterilized ddH2O and invert the tube to clean the agarose beads at 20°C–25°C. Repeat this for 3 times. Be careful not to aspirate the beads.\nCritical: the Lysis Buffer needs to be removed to prevent it from interacting with the SDS in the Agarose Wash Buffer.\nCombine the beads from these three reactions for each treatment as indicated in step #12, resuspend the beads in 3 mL Agarose Wash Buffer and then add 30 μL of 1 M DTT. Vortex briefly.\nNote: Make sure the DTT is not oxidized.",
    "Note: The frozen agarose wash buffer needs to warm up to 20°C–25°C and be uniformly transparent before use.\nThe beads were incubated at 70°C for 15 min and then set at 20°C–25°C for 30 min. Centrifuge at 1000×g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C, discard supernatant and keep the beads.\nAdd 3 mL Agarose Wash Buffer containing 40 mM iodoacetamide solution to re-suspend the beads and incubate the alkylation reaction on the rotator in darkness for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nBeads rinse\nTiming: 1 day\nSpin columns in the kit were used to wash the beads. Transfer the beads to the spin columns, and centrifuge at 1000×g for 1 min at 20°C–25°C.\nSpin columns in the kit were used to wash the beads. Transfer the beads to the spin columns, and centrifuge at 1000×g for 1 min at 20°C–25°C.\nResuspend the beads in the spin columns with 2 mL Agarose Wash Buffer with 1% SDS, and then allow the liquid flow through the column by gravity at 20°C–25°C. Repeat this step 10 times.\nWash the beads by adding 2 mL of 8 M urea/100 mM Tris (pH=8.0) to the spin column. Let the liquid flow through the column by gravity. Repeat this step 20 times to remove SDS.\nWash the beads with 2 mL of 20% acetonitrile-ddH2O solution. Let the solution flow through the spin column by gravity. Repeat this step 20 times.\nNote: Centrifugation at 1000×g for 1 min can be also performed to spin down the washing buffer. Given many repeated washing steps, we recommend having the washing buffer flow through by gravity, which was convenient to carry out. It takes around 2–3 minutes to have 2 mL of wash buffer flowing through by gravity.",
    "Critical: The target proteins are covalently linked to the beads. This stringent wash can effectively remove proteins non-specifically bound to the beads. Moreover, SDS causes damages to mass spectrometry. Thus, washing the beads with 8 M urea and 20% acetonitrile to get rid of residual SDS before mass spec analysis is crucial.\nTrypsin digestion of beads-bound proteins\nTiming: 18 h\nCap the bottom of the spin column to prevent solution flowing through, resuspend the beads with 0.5 mL of digestion buffer (40 mM NH4HCO3, 10% acetonitrile), and transfer the beads into a clean 2 mL-tube.\nCap the bottom of the spin column to prevent solution flowing through, resuspend the beads with 0.5 mL of digestion buffer (40 mM NH4HCO3, 10% acetonitrile), and transfer the beads into a clean 2 mL-tube.\nWash the spin column with 0.5 mL additional digestion buffer, and then transfer it to the 2 mL-tube with transferred beads. Repeat this step 2 times.\nCentrifuge at 1000×g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C to pellet the beads, discard the supernatant and leave about 0.2 mL of digestion buffer above the beads. Do not suck the beads out.\nAdd 30 μL of 0.1 μg/μL trypsin to the beads, tap to mix gently, and then incubate at 37°C for 14 h. Flick the tube 4–5 times during the incubation. Continuous shaking is not required.\nNote: If specific digestion sites are preferred, other proteases, such as Pepsin and Glu-c, can be also used.\nPeptides preparation for mass spectrometry analysis\nTiming: 16 h\nCentrifuge at 1000×g for 5 min at 20°C–25°C to pellet the beads and then carefully transfer the supernatant with digested peptides into a clean 1.5 mL-tube.",
    "Resuspend the beads in additional 300 μL ddH2O, vortex briefly, pellet the beads by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000×g at 20°C–25°C, and then transfer the supernatant to the clean 1.5 mL-tube with the transferred digested peptides. Repeat this step 3 times.\nCritical: Make sure the final acetonitrile concentration is 2%.\nAdd 2 μL of 100% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to acidify the diluted digest.\nThe digested peptides were desalted with a C-18 column. Add the next solution after each solution completely flows through by gravity.\nAdd 1 mL of 100% methanol to the C-18 column, allow it to flow through and discard the effluent.\nAdd 2 mL of ddH2O to the cartridge, allow it to flow through and discard the effluent.\nAdd the acidified digest to the C-18 column, allow it to flow through by gravity, and then add the effluent back to the C-18 column.\nAdd 1 mL of 5% methanol to the C-18 column and discard the effluent.\nAdd 200 μL of 80% methanol to the C-18 column and collect the effluent with a new 1.5 mL tube. Repeat one time.\nDry the desalted peptide solution with a vacuum centrifugal concentrator (Christ, CT02-50), centrifuging at 1300 rpm for 2 h at −60°C. Keep them at −20°C until ready for MS analysis."
