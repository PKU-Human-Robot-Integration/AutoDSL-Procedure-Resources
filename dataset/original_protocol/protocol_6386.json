    "PreparationPrepare two 100 mm cell culture dishes and add approximately 20 ml of D-PBS to each, also two 60 mm cell culture dishes and add approximately 6 ml of D-PBS to each. Then, place four dishes on ice.Prepare working medium (follow Recipe 1, keep on ice), with 50 ml of working medium enough for 20 embryos.Prepare two 60 mm cell culture dishes and add approximately 6 ml of working medium, then place on ice.Prepare organ culture medium (follow Recipe 2, keep at 4 °C), use 1.8 ml of organ culture medium for each well.Embryonic mandible isolation (Figure 2)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200120/20200120000801_6882.jpgFigure 2. Procedure for isolation of embryonic mandibleEuthanize 13-day-pregnant female mouse according to local guidelines. Place the mouse on back on dissection table.Soak mouse abdomen fur with 70% ethanol.Cut skin with tweezers (Figure 1A-a) and scissors (Figure 1A-b), then pull away skin to expose abdominal wall.Cut abdominal wall with tweezers (Figure 1A-a) and fine scissors (Figure 1A-c).Use tweezers (Figure 1A-a) to lift up the uterine horns and cut them away with fine scissors (Figure 1A-c). Place in 100 mm dish with cold D-PBS on ice (Figure 2).Separate uterus in D-PBS dish with cleaned scissors.Isolate each embryo by gently slicing through uterus with precision tweezers (Figure 1A-d).Transfer embryos to new D-PBS dish.Separate head and body parts of embryos with precision tweezers under stereo microscope (Figure 1B) in 60 mm D-PBS dish.Cut off mandible through line from corner of mouth to ear (Figure 2). Next, move separated mandibles into new 60 mm D-PBS dish on ice (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Mandible separation. (All animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the Kyushu University Animal Experiment Center (protocol no. A26-208-0, April 1st 2018- Match 31th 2020). )Mandibular molar germ dissection and seedingTransfer mandible into 60 mm dish containing working medium under stereo microscope.",
    "The mandible molars can be seen on the side of the tongue (Figure 3A). Carefully separate tooth germ including surrounding mesenchyme from the mandible with precision tweezers, and place them into new 60 mm dish containing working medium on ice (Figure 3B).Add 1.8 ml of organ culture medium to each well of 6-well plate, then place cell culture inserts into wells (Figures 3C-3D).Place tooth germs on inserts with epithelium down and mesenchyme up, which allows for epithelium side to be easily seen under microscope. When tooth germ is placed in opposite manner, observation of tooth shape is difficult. Epithelium looks hyaline and mesenchyme contains capillary vessels can be seen. Approximately 9 tooth germs can be seeded in 1 well (Figure 3D).Culture tooth germs at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.Take photos under microscope every 2 or 3 days. Representative developing tooth, salivary gland, and hair are shown in Figure 4.Organ culture medium should be changed every 3 days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200120/20200120000830_6451.jpgFigure 3.

Development of epithelial-mesenchymal tissue using ex vivo organ culturesiRNA-mediated knockdown methodPrepare siRNA transfection mixture with 500 nM of siRNA using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent according to manufacturer’s protocol (follow Recipe 3).Drop 8 μl of siRNA transfection mixture directly on top of each tooth germ. Culture tooth germs at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 2 to 7 days. siRNA must be added every 2 or 3 days.For observations, take photos under microscope every 2 or 3 days (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200120/20200120000913_5720.jpgFigure 5.
