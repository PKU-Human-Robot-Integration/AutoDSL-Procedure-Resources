    "Informed consent was obtained from every patient before surgery. After the interventions anonymized retrospective data was used in this study.\n1. Steps in the traditional workflow of dynamic navigation systems using labeled clip calibration method (only for use on jawbone with teeth):\nAttach a radiopaque fixation clip to the teeth of the jawbone where the treatment is to be performed (maxilla/mandible) using a thermoplastic material.\nMake a CBCT examination of the patient with a labeled clip in the mouth (CBCT, FOV 8 cm x 11 cm, 12 mA, 95 kV).\nPlan the position of the implant according to the prosthetic architecture with the appropriate software.\nCalibrate the device (each step can be activated on display with the Play symbol).\n\t\nRegister the handpiece.\n\t\t\nCalibrate handpiece chuck.\nCalibrate the rotating marker-disc inserted into the handpiece.\nAssemble the arm between the patient tracker and the labeled clip, and calibrate it.\nCheck calibration by holding the tip of the measured drill to the surface of the labeled clip (Figure 1).\n\t\nFix the labeled clip holding the optical marker (tracker) on the teeth of the upper or lower jaw (on which jaw the implant placement occurs). Ensure to insert the clip in the same position registered on the preoperative CBCT.\nCalibrate the labeled clip by touching the metal spheres of the clip with the pivot of the probe.\nPerform the navigated implant placement in local anesthesia, injecting 2 mL of articain (80 mg/2 mL articain/ampoule).\n\t\nMeasure the drill length (touching the drill to the go plate) (Figure 2).\nCheck the real-time visual accuracy before drilling (touching the drill to any tooth surface and checking that it is in the same position on the monitor and the mouth).\nDetermine the entry point of drilling. Explore the operation site without the flap.",
    "Drill the bone with dynamic navigation control (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5) .\nMeasure the implant length (touching the implant to the go plate).\nPlace the implant with the handpiece wearing the tracker controlled by the dynamic navigation system.\nClose the wound with 5.0 monofilament, nonabsorbable polypropylene suture, or fix the prefabricated prosthetic work.\nAcquire control radiologic imaging (CBCT, FOV 8 cm x 11 cm, 12 mA, 95 kV).\n2. Steps in the dynamic navigation systems using the tracer calibration method (not labeled method):\nPerform CBCT of the patient (without clip in the mouth).\nPlan the position of the implant according to the prosthetic architecture with the appropriate software.\nCalibrate the device as detailed in step 1.4.\nCalibrate the system without a labeled clipÂ (not labeled method).\n\t\nTransfer the plan of the implant surgical placement into the software of the used navigation system. Select the workspace on the 3D CT image of the navigation software.\nFix the tracker on the teeth (with an unlabelled clip) or in case of an edentulous jaw with a special tracker-holding arm.\nSelect the typical anatomical points (teeth or bone surface) on a 3D CT image of the navigation system (minimum three points).\nIdentify the selected anatomical points in the mouth by touching them with a probe tool. (Figure 6).\nPerform refinement procedure on three to four areas by drawing on the surface of the anatomical structure with a probe.\nPlace the implant with navigation in local anesthesia, injecting 2 mL of articain (80 mg/2 mL articain/ampoule).\n\t\nMeasure the drill length (touching the drill to the go plate).\nCheck the real-time visual accuracy before drilling (touching the drill to any tooth surface and checking that it is in the same position on the monitor and in the mouth).",
