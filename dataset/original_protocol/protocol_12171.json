    "1. MSC Isolation and Expansion\nObtain early passage MSCs from Center for the Preparation and Distribution of Adult Stem Cells (http://medicine.tamhsc.edu/irm/msc-distribution.html[href=http://medicine.tamhsc.edu/irm/msc-distribution.html])15 as frozen vials. Alternatively, isolate MSCs from bone marrow aspirates following a routine protocol14 and store as frozen vials.\nPrepare complete culture medium (CCM), which is minimal essential medium alpha (αMEM) supplemented with 15-20% premium select FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1x penicillin-streptomycin. Sterilize the medium by filtration.\nPlace 30 ml of CCM into a 150 mm cell culture dish and incubate the dish for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\nIncubate the frozen vial containing approximately 106 MSCs for 2 min in a 37 °C water bath.\nTransfer the contents of the vial to the culture dish using a 5 ml serological pipet and wash the vial several times with 1-2 ml CCM from the dish to capture residual cells. Place the dish overnight in an appropriate incubator.\nCarefully wash the culture twice with room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and detach the MSCs with 3 ml of pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution. Detachment usually takes approximately 3-4 min in the incubator.\nNeutralize the trypsin in the dish with 6 ml CCM pre-warmed to 37 °C and transfer the cell suspension into a 50 ml conical tube. Combine with washes of PBS to maximize cell yield.\nCentrifuge the cells (450 x g) for 10 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the cells in a small volume of CCM and count the viable cells using a hemocytometer and trypan blue.",
    "Seed an appropriate number of 150 mm dishes at 100 cells/cm2 in 30 ml of warm CCM and incubate the cultures until approximately 70-80% confluent, usually 7 days with medium changes every 2-3 days and 24-48 hr prior to harvest.\nHarvest the cells as above with trypsin/EDTA and combine all the cells into a single conical tube with the appropriate medium. Centrifuge again and re-suspend the cells into a small volume of the same medium for cell counts. Use standard CCM (containing FBS) or various commercially available XF media formulations, here referred to as XF medium-1 (XFM-1) and XF medium-2 (XFM-2), both with and without human serum albumin (HSA, 13 mg/ml) supplementation.\n2. Preparation of Activated MSC Spheroids in 3-D Hanging Drop Cultures under XF Conditions\nTo generate spheroids of approximately 25,000 cells, dilute the harvested MSCs into CCM, XFM-1, XFM-1 + HSA (13 mg/ml), XFM-2, or XFM-2 + HSA (13 mg/ ml) at 714 cells/µl.\nPipette 35 µl/drops of the cells onto the underside of a 150 mm inverted culture dish lid. Multiple drops can be easily pipetted by using a multichannel pipette.\n\tNOTE: If larger or smaller spheroids are desired, change the cell concentration or the drop volume (25-45 µl) appropriately.\nTransfer 20 ml of room temperature PBS into the base of the dish and in one continuous and steady motion flip the lid, containing the drops, so that the drop apices face downward. Place the lid carefully on the base of the culture dish.\nTransfer the dish into the incubator for 3 days without disturbing it to permit appropriate sphere assembly.\nAfter 72 hr, begin the spheroid harvest by removing the lid carefully and inverting it so that the drops, once again, face upward.",
    "Angle the lid to approximately 10-20° and push the drops, containing the spheroids, to the plate edge using a cell lifter.\nTransfer the spheres and medium into a 15 ml conical tube with a 1,000 µl pipette. Use room temperature PBS and the pipette with the same tip to wash the plate and ensure maximal recovery of spheroids.\nFor real-time PCR assays (protocol 3), centrifuge the sphere suspension at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant. Wash the spheroids with PBS and repeat both the centrifugation and aspiration steps. For delivery into animals (protocol 8), allow spheres to settle in the bottom of the tube (~3-4 min) without centrifugation.\n3. Real-time PCR of Anti-inflammatory and Anti-cancer Markers\nUse the RNA extraction kit with homogenizer columns and RNase-Free DNase Set to isolate DNA-free total RNA from monolayer MSCs (Protocol 1) and MSC spheroids (Protocol 2) that were washed with PBS and centrifuged.\nLyse at least 100,000 monolayer MSCs and 20 spheroids from each condition in separate 15 ml conical tubes with RLT buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (1:100).\nTransfer the thoroughly mixed lysates into 1.5 ml RNase-free tubes and place into a freezer (-80 °C) for at least 3 hr to aid in spheroid lysis.\nThaw the cell lysates on ice, vortex briefly, and follow the manufacturer's instructions for RNA isolation using a commercially available mammalian total RNA isolation kit.\nQuantify and assess the quality of the isolated RNA using a spectrophotometer.\nUse the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit or equivalent according to manufacturer's instructions to generate cDNA for real-time PCR.\nPlace cDNA samples, commercially designed real-time PCR primers/probes (Gene Expression Assays), and PCR Master Mix on ice. Use primers/probes for GAPDH (control), PTGS2 (COX-2, anti-inflammatory), TNFAIP6 (TSG6, anti-inflammatory), TRAIL (anti-cancer), and IL-24 (anti-cancer).",
    "Prepare the real-time PCR reactions according to manufacturer's instructions for Gene Expression Assays and Fast Universal Master Mix.\nFollow the guidelines for the real-time PCR instrument for generating the experiment documents and performing the run.\nAnalyze the data using the ΔΔCT method by calculating the relative changes (relative quantity, RQ) in gene expression using GAPDH as the endogenous control and monolayer MSCs as a baseline8,14.\n4. Collection of CM for Assays of Immunomodulatory and Anti-cancer Potential\nHarvest the spheroids and CM as described above into a 15 ml conical tube, using a cell lifter and a pipette, however, do not wash the dish lids with PBS as this will dilute the CM.\nCentrifuge at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature, carefully collect the cell-free supernatant with a pipette, and transfer the supernatant into 1.5 ml tubes.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5-10 min at room temperature, carefully collect the clarified CM with a pipette, and transfer the CM into new 1.5 ml tubes for storage in a freezer (-80 °C). Prepare aliquots of the CM prior to freezing when using it for multiple assays.\n\tNOTE: Prior to performing downstream assays, PGE2 concentration, a good indicator of anti-inflammatory potential of CM, can be determined using a commercial ELISA kit according to manufacturer's instructions. TSG6 concentration can be determined using a published protocol14.\n5. Macrophage Assay to Assess the Anti-inflammatory Potential of MSC-CM\nPrepare macrophage medium, which consists of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing L-alanyl-L-glutamine and supplemented with 10% premium select FBS and 1x penicillin-streptomycin. Filter-sterilize the medium.\nObtain a frozen vial of approximately 106 J774 mouse macrophages and incubate the vial for 2 min in a 37 °C water bath.",
    "Transfer the contents of the vial into a 15 ml conical tube, add 9 ml of macrophage medium, and centrifuge for 5 min at 200-300 x g and at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant, suspend the macrophages into 1 ml of macrophage medium, and transfer the macrophages into a 150 mm petri dish containing 30 ml of macrophage medium.\nChange the medium every 2 days and incubate the cells in the incubator until approximately 70-80% confluent.\n\tNOTE: The macrophages do not adhere tightly to the petri dish, thus care should be taken not to lose cells with medium change.\nHarvest the macrophages by spraying the macrophage medium onto the cells with a pipette. Transfer the cells into a 50 ml conical tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 200-300 x g and room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant and suspend the cells in a small volume of macrophage medium for cell counts with a hemocytometer. Adjust the concentration to 200,000 cells/ml with macrophage medium.\nTo start the set up for the macrophage assay, add 480 µl of macrophage medium into wells of a 12-well plate.\nAdd 20 µl of macrophage medium into non-stimulated control wells and 20 µl of non-conditioned or MSC-conditioned medium, prepared above, in experimental wells. Mix the medium in the wells by tapping the plate.\nTransfer 500 µl of the macrophage cell suspension to the non-stimulated macrophage control wells.\nStimulate the remaining macrophages with addition of 1:500-1:1,000 of 0.1 mg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and incubate 5-10 min at room temperature.\nTransfer 500 µl of the stimulated macrophages into the wells with non-conditioned or MSC-conditioned medium. Mix the wells by steadily rocking the plate several times.\nTransfer the plate to an incubator for 16-18 hr.",
    "Harvest the macrophage-conditioned medium and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the supernatant into new tubes and assay for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) content by commercial ELISA kits following the manufacturer's instructions.\n6. Splenocyte Assay to Assess the Immunomodulatory Potential of Spheroid-CM\nPrepare complete splenocyte medium, which consists of Rosewell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1x penicillin-streptomycin, and 2-mercaptoethanol. Filter-sterilize the medium.\nHarvest spleens from euthanized-male BALB/c mice through an incision prepared on the left side of the abdomen over the spleen, approximately mid-way between the front and hind legs14. Transfer the spleen to a 70 µm cell strainer to isolate the splenocytes14.\nIsolate the splenocytes/lymphocytes by pushing the spleens through the 70 µm strainer into a sterile petri dish using the soft rubber/plastic end of a plunger from a 2-3 ml syringe14. Use a grinding circular motion to dissociate the spleens.\nWash the cell strainer several times with cold PBS and transfer cells from the petri dish into a 50 ml conical tube. Fill the tube with cold PBS and centrifuge (500 x g) at 4 °C for 10 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and clear the cells from erythrocytes by incubation with 5-10 ml red blood cell lysis solution (per spleen) for 5-10 min.\nStop the lysis by adding cold PBS to the tube and centrifuge for 5-10 min at 500 x g and at 4°C.\nSuspend the isolated cells in complete splenocyte medium, filter through a 40 µm strainer, and count the cells using a hemocytometer. Add splenocyte medium to the cell suspension to achieve a final cell concentration of 106 cells/ml\n\tNOTE: This technique typically yields approximately 3 x 107 splenocytes per mouse spleen.",
    "Stimulate the appropriate number of splenocytes with 2 µg/ml anti-CD3e antibody for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: The quantity of splenocytes required depends on the number of experimental conditions as determined by the investigator (see step 6.9). For every experimental sample/well, 106 splenocytes are required.\nTransfer 106 splenocytes (stimulated or non-stimulated) into wells of a 12-well plate and add non-conditioned (controls) or MSC-CM into wells at final dilution of 1:10-1:20.\nHarvest the splenocyte CM after 24 hr and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the supernatant into new tubes and assay for interferon gamma (IFN-γ) content by commercial ELISA kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\n7. Prostate Cancer Assay to Assess the Anti-cancer Potential of Spheroid-CM\nPrepare complete RPMI growth medium that is RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x penicillin-streptomycin.\nObtain a frozen vial of LNCaP prostate cancer cells and incubate the vial for 2 min in a 37 °C water bath.\nTransfer the contents of the vial into a culture dish containing 30 ml of complete RPMI growth medium using a motorized pipettor and a 5 ml serological pipet. Wash the vial several times with the medium from the dish and place the dish into the incubator.\nJust before the cells reach confluency, wash the culture twice with room temperature PBS and detach the LNCaP cells with 3 ml of pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution.\nNeutralize the trypsin in the dish with the complete RPMI growth medium and transfer the cells together with washes into a 50 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 450 x g for 10 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the cells into small volume of the complete RPMI growth medium and count the cancer cells using a hemocytometer.",
    "Transfer LNCaP cells into a 96-well dish at 5,000 cells/well in 120 µl of complete RPMI growth medium containing 25% of non-conditioned or spheroid-CM. Incubate in the incubator for 72 hr.\nTo perform a cell growth assay using a cell proliferation assay kit, aspirate the medium from wells and transfer the plate into a freezer (-80 °C) for at least 3 hr.\n\t\nThaw the plate and lyse the cells in each well by adding 100 µl of cell lysis reagent containing 180 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml RNase A.\nFor a standard curve, lyse known amounts of LNCaP cells as described above.\nAfter 1 hr, add 100 µl of 1x cell lysis buffer containing 1:100 dilution of cell proliferation assay reagent and measure the fluorescence in each well to determine the cell amount.\n8. Intraperitoneal Delivery of Intact Spheroids\nPrepare spheroid MSCs as described above (protocol 2) and resuspend the spheres in sterile Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 0.2-0.5 % HSA to maintain XF conditions. HSA in the solution helps to prevent sphere adhesion to plastic during injection.\nTransfer 40-120 spheroids into 15 ml conical tubes and wash the cells by adding 6 ml HBSS/HSA to the tubes. Allow 3-4 min for spheres to descend. Prepare an independent conical tube of spheroids for each animal. Also, prepare additional tubes of spheroids for assays determining spheroid retention (see 8.18 below) and production of therapeutic factors after transfer (see 8.19 below) if desired.\nAspirate the supernatant, overlay the spheroids with 100-200 µl of sterile HBSS supplemented with 0.2-0.5% HSA, and place the tubes on ice.\nBriefly anesthetize the animals with 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen until the disappearance of pinch-toe reflex for approximately 2 min in the induction chamber.",
    "Place the animal inside the BSL-2 cabinet, dorsal aspect down (ventral side facing up), with the continuous flow of 1.5% isoflurane/oxygen mixture via a nose cone.\nClean the lower mouse abdomen with an antiseptic such as 70% alcohol.\nRemove the cap of the 20 G intravenous (iv) catheter and perform the intraperitoneal injection with the catheter-stiletto assembly. Use one hand to hold the mouse skin and another to perform the injection. Locate the point of injection approximately in the middle of an artificial line connecting a flexed knee joint and genital area with the needle tip pointing toward the midline.\n\tNOTE: The catheter-stiletto assembly has a higher resistance than a regular needle, therefore care has to be taken as not to inject the needle too deep into the abdomen, which could result in injury to internal organs. Penetration of the skin and then muscles/peritoneal membrane can be felt during catheter placement.\nGently remove the metal stiletto/needle from the catheter-stiletto assembly. Check the stiletto for blood, urine and feces and discard it. Blood on the needle indicates puncture of internal organ(s).\nHold the plastic catheter in an upright position during the injections to permit fluid flow.\nConfirm the proper placement of the plastic catheter by injecting approximately 100 µl of sterile HBSS/HSA through the catheter using a pipette with a 100-200 µl tip. Place the end of the pipette tip inside the catheter syringe adapter forming a tight seal. Slowly inject the fluid inside the peritoneal cavity.",
    "NOTE: The fluid in a properly positioned catheter will freely flow inside the peritoneal cavity with only minor adjustment of the catheter. Improper placement of the catheter (subcutaneous or intra-intestinal, or if the tip of the needle injured peritoneal organs such as kidneys) will increase resistance and reduce flow. Subcutaneous placement will result in a formation of an obvious \"bubble\" under the skin.\nCollect the MSC spheroids, prepared in 100-200 µl of HBSS/HSA (step 8.3), using a 200 µl pipette tip, and transfer the entire volume of spheres (40-120 spheres) into the peritoneal cavity through the catheter as described above.\nWash the tube containing spheres with 100 µl of HBSS/HSA using the same tip as above to collect any residual spheroids and inject them into the peritoneal cavity.\n(Optional) Inject an additional 100 µl of HBSS/HSA into the peritoneal cavity to wash the catheter.\nPlace the gauze pad soaked in antiseptic over the catheter and slowly remove the catheter from the peritoneal cavity and discard it.\nGently massage the peritoneal cavity with the fingers to ensure even distribution of the spheroids.\nLet the animal recover under close supervision and watch for bleeding from the injection site.\nInspect the catheter and 15 ml tube for any remaining spheroids. It is normal to observe a few spheres in the catheter/tube.\n\tNOTE: The technique described for MSC spheroid delivery can be adopted for use in normal animals or in a variety of injury models. This technique has been successfully used to inject spheroids in mouse corneal injury and endotoxemia models, as well as in a zymosan-induced peritonitis model8.",
    "To quantify the number of retained spheroids (optional), use a DNA-based cell number quantification kit/reagent. Hold the used catheter over the 15 ml tube and vigorously dispense HBSS/HSA through the catheter to force any remaining spheres back into the 15 ml tube.\n\t\nCentrifuge the 15 ml tube at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant. Transfer the tube containing the spheroid pellet into a freezer (-80 °C) for at least 3 hr.\nThaw the tube and lyse the spheres by adding 500 µl of cell lysis reagent containing 180 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml RNase A.\nFor a control, freeze and lyse a known amount of spheroids (preferably equivalent to the number of spheroids prepared for a single injection) as described above.\nAfter 1 hr, transfer 100 µl of the cell lysate, in duplicate, into a 96-well microplate and add to each well 100 µl of 1x cell lysis buffer containing a 1:50 dilution of cell proliferation assay reagent from the kit. After 10 min, measure the fluorescence in each well to determine the number of spheres that were not injected by comparing the experimental sample(s) with the control sample.\nEvaluate the activation level of spheroids prepared for injection (optional) by measuring concentration of PGE2 and TSG6 produced by transferred spheres. Transfer 40-120 spheres through the catheter, as described above, into a 12-well or 6-well plate containing 1 or 2 ml αMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 1x penicillin/streptomycin. Place the plates in the incubator for 6 hr.\n\t\nTransfer the medium from the wells after 6 hr into 1.5 or 15 ml tubes and centrifuge the tubes at 450 x g for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Transfer the cell-free supernatant into fresh 1.5 ml tubes using a pipette and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5-10 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the clarified CM (supernatant) into new 1.5 ml tubes and assay for PGE2 concentration (good indicator of anti-inflammatory potential of CM) using a commercial ELISA kit according to manufacturer's instructions. TSG6 concentration can be determined using a published protocol14.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
