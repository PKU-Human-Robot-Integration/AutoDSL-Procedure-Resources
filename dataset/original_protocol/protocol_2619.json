Here we describe a method for tail skin grafts.\nAssemble the materials as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2276-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Skin transplantation surgery materials\nComponents are 1: isoflurane mouse anaesthetic machine, 2: flow regulator, 3: anaesthetic induction chamber, 4: nose-cone, 5: warming pad, 6: surgical forceps, 7: surgical scissors, 8: bead steriliser, 9: sterile gauze, 10: syringes for saline, ampicillin and buprenorphine injections, 11: 30 gauge needles, 12: Chlorhexidine 0.5% in 70% ethanol solution, 13: sterile normal saline, 14: Dermabond surgical adhesive, 15: size 21 curved scalpel blade, 16: non-adhesive absorptive dressing.\nDonor skin collection\nTiming: 15 min per donor mouse\nAutoclave surgical instruments at the beginning of each daily session of surgery.\nWeigh donor mice pre-operatively and record their weights.\nInduce anaesthesia by using isoflurane at 3% and supplemental oxygen at 0.6 L/min.\nCheck the tail pinch reflex to ensure sufficient depth of anaesthesia before an incision is made.\nAmputate the donor tail using a scalpel and euthanise the donor mouse by isoflurane overdose with cervical dislocation under anaesthesia.\nCollect the tail skin by making a cranial to caudal inferior midline incision in the amputated tail.\nMobilise the tail skin and remove it from the musculoskeletal structures.\nIrrigate the tail skin with sterile normal saline containing ampicillin (10 mg/mL).\nFlatten the tail skin and cut it into squares measuring approximately 10 mm × 10 mm.\nStore in sterile saline/ampicillin soaked gauze over ice in preparation for grafting (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2276-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Left to right: (B) prepared graft bed, (C) graft immediately after placement, (D) graft after tissue adhesive applied, (E) bandaged mouse.\n(F) Representative macroscopic images demonstrating the process of graft rejection. The first image (Day 9) shows a well healed-in skin graft at 9 days post-transplant. The middle image (Day 11) shows an inflamed skin graft undergoing rejection. The last image (Day 12) shows a necrotic skin graft on the day of rejection by the recipient mouse.\nRecipient skin transplantation\nTiming: 15 min per recipient mouse\nWeigh recipient mice pre-operatively and record their weights.\nInduce anaesthesia with isoflurane at 3% and supplemental oxygen at 0.6 L/min.\nPlace the recipient mouse on a heat pad, separated from the pad by 2 layers of sterile gauze.\nInject the recipient mouse subcutaneously with buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, 50 μL) for analgesia, prophylactic ampicillin (100 mcg/kg, 100 μL) and 1 mL of preheated (41°C) sterile normal saline (divided between 2 locations).\nApply a lubricating eye ointment to both eyes and insert a lubricated rectal probe for temperature monitoring.\nMove the recipient mouse to the ventral position and prepare the dorsal skin with chlorhexidine 0.5% in 70% alcohol solution.\nShave the back and lateral thoracic regions with a scalpel blade from the cervical to the distal thoracic levels.\nCheck the tail pinch reflex to ensure sufficient depth of anaesthesia before an incision is made.\nPrepare a graft bed on the back by sharp dissection (with scissors) and removal of skin approximately 10 mm × 10 mm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nImmediately after incision, reduce the inhalational anaesthetic concentration to ∼1% for maintenance and confirm adequate depth of anaesthesia by testing the tail pinch reflex.\nIrrigate the graft bed with sterile normal saline.",
    "Place the graft in the bed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nSecure the edges of the graft with small amounts of clinical grade cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive (Dermabond or Vetbond) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nRemove the rectal probe.\nPlace a non-adhesive absorptive dressing on top of the graft and secure firmly with an adhesive cloth bandage (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCease inhalational anaesthesia and transfer the recipient mouse to the recovery cage.\nCritical: Only apply adhesive to the edges of the graft and ensure that the wound edges are closely apposed.\nCritical: Bandages must be applied tightly to prevent removal by mice. However, not so tightly that their breathing is restricted.\nPart 2: Recovery and monitoring\nTiming: Recovery – 30 min & monitoring – intermittently over 7 weeks\nThis section describes the procedure for post-operative recovery and monitoring of skin grafted mice.\nImmediately post-operatively, allow the recipient mouse to recover individually in an empty cage lined with a disposable towel preheated on a heat mat set to 38°C.\nPlace only half the recovery cage on the heating mat to ensure the recipient mouse has access to a cooler environment to prevent overheating.\nMonitor the recipient mouse for a minimum of 15 min and once awake and exploring in the recovery cage, return the recipient mouse to a holding cage.\nSingly-house the recipient mice.\nCritical: In prior experience, group-housed mice frequently removed skin grafts from each other’s backs during the healing-in process, resulting in attrition from the experiment and sometimes causing severe bleeding if newly- formed blood vessels were disrupted.\nMonitor the recipient mice twice for the first 5 days post-operatively, paying special attention to the detection of urethral plugging.\nAssess the recipient mice on posture, activity, gait, respiratory pattern, hydration, bodily condition, hair, surgical wound, other abnormal signs and body weight (weight only performed once daily).",
    "Monitor the recipient mice daily for the next 5 post-operative days.\nRemove the bandage on day 7 post-transplantation.\nMonitor the grafts for rejection.\nNote: the skin grafts are deemed rejected when less than 20% of the graft remains. The tempo of rejection depends upon the degree of mismatch between donor and recipient. Rejection generally occurs between 9 and 22 days post-transplant. Graft rejection can progress rapidly from inflammation to necrosis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F). Rejected grafts may eventually scab and fall off.\nCritical: Urethral plugs can obstruct the urethra and lead to urinary retention. Untreated urethral obstruction will ultimately lead to renal failure.\nPart 3: AAV inoculation\nTiming: 40 min for a single mouse or 90 min for a group of 6 mice\nThis section describes the steps involved in vector preparation for intravenous administration and injection of recipient mice.\nVector preparation\nTiming: 20 min\nMake single-dose aliquots from the stock solution in sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store them at –80°C.\nA single dose for each mouse is 5 × 1011 vgc.\nBefore injection, thaw an aliquot on ice and add 500 μL of sterile PBS into the microcentrifuge tube.\nKeep the diluted dose on ice and draw just before injection.\nCritical: All AAV work must be carried out in a biosafety cabinet with adequate personal protection.\nIntravenous injection\nTiming: 20 min per mouse\n30 days post-graft rejection, place the primed mouse in an induction chamber inside a biosafety cabinet.\nInduce anaesthesia with isoflurane at 3% and supplemental oxygen at 0.6 L/min.\n[male mice] Gently express the penis then stabilize it between the tips of blunt forceps. Visualise the penile vein and prepare the skin overlying the vein using chlorhexidine 0.5% in 70% ethanol.\n[male mice] Administer the AAV vector slowly intravenously via the penile vein using a 30G needle.",
    "Note: the penile vein is larger than the tail vein and penile vein injection does not require pre-heating of the mice to dilate the blood vessels.\n[male mice] After injection, retract the penis back into the abdomen and apply gentle pressure with a sterile cotton bud to achieve haemostasis.\n[female mice] Warm the mouse using a heat lamp for 2–3 min and prepare the skin overlying the vein using chlorhexidine 0.5% in 70% ethanol.\n[female mice] Administer the AAV vector slowly intravenously via the tail vein using a 30G needle.\n[female mice] After injection, apply gentle pressure with a sterile cotton bud to the tail vein injection site to achieve haemostasis.\nImmediately post-operatively, allow mice to recover individually in an empty cage lined with a disposable towel preheated on a heat mat set to 38°C.\nNote: Place only half the recovery cage on the heating mat to ensure the mouse has access to a cooler environment to prevent overheating.\nOnce the mouse has recovered, return it to its cage.\nPart 4: Peptide and tetramer preparation\nTiming: 5 h 15 min for MBL tetramers or 24 h 15 min for BioLegend Flex T tetramers\nThis section describes how to prepare peptide-exchanged tetramers for alloreactive T cell staining.\nReconstitution of peptides\nTiming: 15 min\nPeptides were synthesized with an average of 98% purity by GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd.\nDissolve lyophilized peptides (∼24 mg) individually in 500 μL of sterile DMSO.\nDilute the dissolved peptides in sterile H2O to achieve a final concentration of 5 mM.\nStore the diluted solution at –80°C.\nMBL tetramer preparation\nTiming: 5 h\nMBL QuickSwitch H-2Kb tetramers incorporating the selected peptides were generated and quantified according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) [Link: https://www.mblintl.com/products/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/15.17.1.8-Quickswitch-Quant-H-2-kb-ve3_rev1909_APedit.pdf[href=https://www.mblintl.com/products/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/15.17.1.8-Quickswitch-Quant-H-2-kb-ve3_rev1909_APedit.pdf]].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2276-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. A schematic diagram of peptide exchange and quantitation of peptide exchange with the MBL QuickSwitch system\n(A) The MBL QuickSwitch system requires a peptide exchange factor to enzymatically exchange peptides.\n(B) Exchanged and un-exchanged tetramers can be captured by beads and subsequently analysed using flow cytometry. Using a FITC-conjugated antibody against the exiting peptide, we can detect un-exchanged tetramers.\n(C) The green histogram shows bead-immobilised un-exchanged tetramers stained with the FITC-conjugated antibody. The grey-filled histogram is a no-antibody control. To illustrate differences in exchange efficiency, we compared staining of tetramers made with either SNYLFTKL or AVVAFVMKM peptides. Tetramers exchanged with SNYLFTKL peptide show complete exchange efficiency (The exiting peptide is no longer present, black histogram is superimposed upon the no-antibody control – 99.5% efficiency). Tetramers exchanged with AVVAFVMKM show incomplete exchange (red histogram – 65.9% efficiency).\n(D and E) Tetramers exchanged with either VGPRYTNL or RTYTYEKL (black histograms) both show complete exchange efficiency. An alternative method of producing multimers should be used to avoid spurious results if exchange efficiency is less than 80%.\nPipette 50 μL of MBL QuickSwitch tetramer into a microtube.\nAdd 1 μL of peptide and 1 μL of Peptide Exchange Factor sequentially, with gentle pipette mixing between each.\nIncubate the mixture at 20°C for 4 h protected from light.\nTo quantitate peptide exchange, tetramers are captured by beads and then incubated with a FITC conjugated antibody against the exiting peptide.\nBioLegend Flex-T multimer preparation\nTiming: 24 h\nBioLegend Flex-T H-2Kb tetramers incorporating the selected peptides were generated and quantified according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) [Link 1: https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/protocols/flex-t-fixed-peptide-tetramer-preparation-and-flow-cytometry-staining-protocol[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/protocols/flex-t-fixed-peptide-tetramer-preparation-and-flow-cytometry-staining-protocol].

    "(A) BioLegend Flex-T system monomers exchange their peptides through a UV-mediated process (long-wave 366 nm).\n(B and C) The peptide exchange efficiency can be quantified using the associated ELISA kit. Three peptides are shown in this graph (SNYLFTKL, VGPRYTNL, RTYTYEKL). The absorbance reading for the “high” standard was arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.0 and other readings were normalised to this as recommended by the manufacturer. Bars represent the mean of duplicate readings, the individual values are shown as dots. Monomers for further use should show an absorbance value at least as high as that for the “medium” standard.\n(D) UVX monomers can be assembled with either PE-conjugated streptavidin or PE-conjugated Klickmer to form tetramers or dextramers, respectively.\nPipette 20 μL of diluted peptide (400 μM) and 20 μL Flex-T monomer into a microtube.\nIlluminate the solution with long-wave 366 nm UV light for 30 min on ice, then incubate for 30 min at 37°C in the dark.\nDetect exchanged monomers (H-2 or HLA) using the LEGEND MAX™ Flex-T™ Human Class I Peptide Exchange ELISA Kit.\n[Tetramer generation] Transfer 30 μL of exchanged monomer into a microtube and add 3.3 μL of PE Streptavidin (0.2 mg/mL).\n[Tetramer generation] Incubate at 4°C for 30 min protected from light.\n[Tetramer generation] Prepare a blocking solution by mixing 1.6 μL of 50 mM D-Biotin and 6 μL of 10% (w/v) sodium azide in 192.4 μL of PBS.\n[Tetramer generation] Add 2.4 μL of blocking solution to the microtube containing the exchanged monomer and PE Streptavidin.\n[Tetramer generation] Incubate at 4°C for at least 16 h protected from light.

From left to right, the visceral anatomy was exposed, a cannula was introduced to the inferior vena cava, the liver turned pale after perfusion.\nSlowly perfuse the liver with 20 mL of PBS at 20°C by manual injection over 1 min. Retrograde perfusion of the liver is achieved.\nTransect the liver lobes and transfer them to a 100 μm cell strainer.\nGently press through and wash through with cold RPMI + 5% FCS (RPMI/FCS5) and then transfer the liver slurry into a 50 mL conical tube.\nWash the liver slurry twice with 50 mL RPMI/FCS5 by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min.\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 15 mL PBS.\nAdd 9 mL of Isotonic Percoll PLUS and mix.\nCentrifuge the solution at 500 × g for 15 min, with no brake.\nDiscard the supernatant (containing hepatocyte debris). The cell pellet contains the liver leukocytes.",
    "Wash the liver leukocytes in the pellet once by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min.\nResuspend in 2 mL of red cell lysis solution.\nIncubate for 2 min at 20°C.\nFollowing this, wash the liver leukocytes twice by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min with RPMI/FCS5 as above, and count viable cells.\nPart 6: Tetramer and antibody staining\nTiming: 4 h 25 min\nThis section describes the method for staining alloreactive T cells using peptide-exchanged tetramers and an antibody panel to determine recognition of pMHC epitopes.\nDasatinib preparation\nTiming: 10 min (for step 65)\nDasatinib is a protein kinase inhibitor which was used in our protocol to enhance pMHC-tetramer staining. Dasatinib prevents T cell receptor (TCR) internalisation thereby increasing the density of cell-surface TCR available for tetramer binding.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nDissolve dasatinib in sterile DMSO to 10 mM concentration and store aliquots at –80°C for no longer than 3 months. The working concentration of dasatinib for incubation with T cells is 50 nM.\nOn the day of tetramer staining, thaw a dasatinib aliquot at 20°C.\nDilute 10 μL of the 10 mM dasatinib solution in 2 mL of PBS. 1:200 dilution of the stock solution to achieve a concentration of 50,000 nM.\nDilute 10 μL of the 50,000 nM dasatinib solution in 2 mL of PBS. 1:40,000 dilution of the stock solution to achieve a concentration of 250 nM. This will be used at step 68.\nCritical: DMSO must be handled with adequate personal protection.\nAntibody preparation\nTiming: 15 min (for step 66)\nFluorophore conjugated antibodies are used in conjunction with tetramer staining to identify surface markers. The list of antibodies is given in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nPrepare the antibody panel in cold staining buffer (2% FCS in PBS) on the day of tetramer staining.",
    "Critical: CD8 antibody must be from the clone KT-15. Other clones can interfere with pMHC tetramer binding and reduce the efficiency of the staining.\nTetramer and antibody staining\nTiming: 4 h\nWash the cells once with staining buffer by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min.\nFor each sample, resuspend 1 million cells in 40 μL of staining buffer.\nIncubate the cells with 50 nM dasatinib for 30 min at 20°C by adding 10 μL of 250 nM dasatinib.\nDuring the incubation period, spin the pMHC tetramer at 16,000 × g for 1 min to remove aggregates.\nAdd 0.5 μg of pMHC-PE tetramer to the cells incubate for 30 min at 20°C.\nFollowing pMHC multimer staining, wash the cells twice with staining buffer by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min.\nIncubate the cells with mouse TruStain FcX (BioLegend) (1 μL in 50 μL of staining buffer) for 10 min at 4°C.\nAdd 0.5 μg of purified monoclonal anti-PE (PE001, 1 μL in 50 μL of staining buffer) to the cells and incubate for 30 min on ice. Anti-PE antibody stabilises the multimers bound by their cognate TCRs by cross-linking these protein complexes.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nWash the cells twice with staining buffer by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min.\nAdd surface antibodies (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] - total volume of 100 μL in staining buffer per sample) to the cells and incubate for 30 min on ice.\nWash the cells twice with PBS by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min.\nAdd viability dye ZNIR (total volume of 100 μL in PBS per sample) and incubate on ice for 15 min.\nWash the cells twice with staining buffer by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 150 μL of staining buffer and filter through a 50 μm nylon mesh.\nCells are ready to be analysed using flow cytometry.\nCritical: We recommend including an FMO (no multimer) control as well as unstained and viability only controls. PD-1 negative bystander cells serve as an internal control population without T cells that respond specifically to the allogeneic pMHC."
