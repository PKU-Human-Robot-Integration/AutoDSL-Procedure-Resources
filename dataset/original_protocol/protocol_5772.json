    "Handling/gentling the animalsSee Figure 2 for a schematic diagram of the entire experimental timeline. Prior to testing, the individuals that will be handling the animals in the experiment should begin to handle (pick up and hold) each animal for a few minutes each day. If the bait is a novel food for the rats, a few pieces of the cereal can also be offered each day to acclimate the rats to the food. Animals should be handled a minimum of 4 days prior to the start of pre-training, but ideally 5-7 days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531030115_0785.jpgFigure 2. Experimental Timeline. The entire experiment takes approximately 18-24 days, including handling, pre-training, and testing. The entire timeline is represented schematically in this Figure.Food deprivation2-3 days before pre-training, food deprivation should begin. First, the baseline weights of all animals should be recorded, and then all food (but not water) should be removed for 24 h. After 24 h, limited food (about 40 g/rat) should be provided on a daily basis. Rats should be weighed each day, and the amount of food provided each day should be adjusted so that animals maintain approximately 85-90% of their baseline weight. Habituation The first day of the experiment, following about 2-3 days of food deprivation, is habituation. Habituation and all other training should occur during the rats’ dark cycle, at approximately the same time (i.e., within a 2-h time window) each day.Lights in the testing room should be dimmed to the lowest level at which the video-cameras can function–if red lights are available, the experiment can be run in darkness with red lights only. The white noise generator should be on. Animals are placed individually into the open field arena, and allowed to explore for 10 min.",
    "At the end of 10 min, the animals are removed from the arena, returned to their home cage, and fed. During habituation and all pre-training and test trials, the experimenter should either leave the room (monitoring the rat via video-camera), or sit still and quietly in a location set back from the open field. There should be no food, drinks, lotions, perfumes, jewelry, music, or other distracting stimuli present in the testing room. Between rats, the arena should be wiped down with an ethanol solution to clean and disperse odor cues.Pre-training After one day of habituation, pre-training begins. All environmental conditions such as lighting and white noise should remain the same as during habituation. Pre-training is run in stages, with animals needing to complete each stage before moving to the next. Animals receive one trial each day for the duration of pre-training. Therefore, the time to complete pre-training may vary, with animals usually requiring approximately 10-14 days.For the first stage of pre-training, four targets are placed randomly in the arena, with one piece of bait on each target. An individual rat is placed in a designated starting point, and allowed to forage for the bait. The trial ends when the rat retrieves all four pieces of bait, or when 10 min is up, whichever happens first. Stage one of pre-training is complete when the animal successfully retrieves all four pieces of bait on two consecutive trials.For stage two, six targets are placed in the arena, each with one piece of bait. Stage two is completed when the rat successfully retrieves all six pieces on one trial.For stage three, eight targets are placed in the arena, each with one piece of bait; completion requires the successful retrieval of all eight pieces on one trial.",
    "Finally, for stage four, 10 baited targets are placed in the arena. Stage four, and pre-training, are complete when the animal successfully retrieves nine out of the 10 targets on three consecutive trials. At this point, the animal can begin the testing phase of the experiment.Testing phaseDuring the testing phase, animals are observed in the arena with a specific target configuration designed to answer a particular test question.The configuration template is first placed on the arena floor, then baited targets are placed, and finally the template should be removed before the rat is placed in the arena. As in pre-training, the behavior of the rat is recorded for 10 min, or until the rat retrieves all of the bait, whichever happens first. After the trial, the rat is placed back into the home cage and fed. The specifics of the configurations (number of targets, location of targets, number of different configurations) will depend on the experimental question. Configurations used in previous research studies (e.g., Blaser and Ginchansky, 2012) may be used for reference; see Figure 3 for examples of four 10-target configurations. Unless the order of testing different configurations is determined by the experimental question, the sequence should be balanced across rats when multiple configurations are used. See Video 1 for an example of a rat’s behavior in a test trial.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531030419_3792.jpgFigure 3. Four example target configurations. A. Simple Baseline; B. Nearest-Neighbor Adequate; C. Cluster Approach; D. Nearest-Neighbor Inadequate. Four example configurations, all with 10 targets are provided in Figure 3. In 3A is a simple baseline configuration to determine baseline motivation and locomotor activity. In 3B is a configuration for which a simple nearest-neighbor strategy produces the optimal route. In 3C is a configuration to determine preference for target clusters.",
    "In 3D is a configuration for which the simple nearest-neighbor strategy produces a sub-optimal route.Video coding and analysisOnce the trials are complete, the video files are coded for several behavioral measures. First, each target is given a unique number. The optimal route (shortest possible path) must also be determined for each configuration. Contact: Contact with a target is recorded when the whiskers, nose, or forepaw of the subject touch either the target or bait. Contact with a target by the tail or hind paws of the animal is not counted. Retrieval: Retrieval of bait is recorded when the subject removes the bait from the target (so all retrieval scores are automatically counted as contact with that target). These are recorded into a data file[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20180527/2870 Supplemental file TSP data example.xlsx] as a list of target numbers in the sequence in which they are contacted, with an additional flag (e.g., color code or highlight) to designate retrievals.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Video of a rat completing a test configuration Transitions: Transitions are calculated from the sequence of target contacts. A transition is defined as the line segment connecting two consecutive contacts. For example, if a subject contacts Target 2 then Target 4, a transition from 2 to 4 is recorded. This establishes a sequence of transitions for each animal on each trial. Optimal Transitions are the segments connecting target pairs along the optimal route. The distance between each target pair (cm) is used to calculate Total Travel Distance for each subject. Because transitions are used to calculate distance measures, these measures do not take into account deviations from the shortest path between two targets. If desired, the videos can also be played through a video-tracking program (such as Ethovision®, Anymaze®, or ViewPoint®) to establish actual travel distances as well.",
    "Memory MeasuresRevisits: Revisits are defined as any contact with a target after the bait from that target is retrieved. Omissions: Omissions are defined as any target that is not visited in the 10-min trial period. Span: Span is defined as the number of targets visited prior to the first revisit. Route Choice Measures Percent Above Optimal: Percent Above Optimal (PAO) is calculated as the difference between the total travel distance and the optimal route distance, divided by the optimal route distance. A lower score indicates better performance, since lower scores indicate shorter path lengths. Proportion of Optimal Transitions: The Proportion of Optimal Transitions is calculated as the number of transitions that fell along the optimal route, divided by the total number of transitions. Proportion of Distance on Optimal: The Proportion of Distance on Optimal is defined as the total distance traveled along the optimal route, divided by the total travel distance."
