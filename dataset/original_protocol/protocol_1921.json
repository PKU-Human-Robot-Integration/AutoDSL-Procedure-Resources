    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nhPSCs expansion\nTiming: ∼5 days\nGrow undifferentiated H9 hESCs (WiCell Research Institute) in 10 mL E8 Essential Medium (according to Thermo Fisher instructions: https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A1517001[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A1517001]) in a VTN-coated 10 cm dish. To differentiate one 6-well plate, you will need 10.8 × 106 cells. Each 10 cm dish yields ∼12 × 106 undifferentiated hPSCs.\nExpand the hPSCs to as many dishes as needed. To split cells:\nAspirate media.\nAdd 6 mL DPBS to the cells.\nAspirate DBPS.\nAdd 4 mL EDTA Dissociation solution. Incubate for 2 min at 37°C.\nAspirate EDTA Dissociation solution.\nResuspend cells by adding 10 mL E8 Essential Medium directly to the cells.\nPipet mixture of media and cells relatively harsh (no more than five times) while rotating the dish to remove all the cells.\nAdd cells to a 15 mL conical tube.\nSplit the cells at a 1:20 ratio using E8 Essential Medium and seed them into a new VTN-coated 10 cm dish.\nCritical: Cell colonies must have clearly defined bright edges with minimal spontaneous differentiation, visualized under a brightfield microscope (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, 1B, and 1D, day 0). Differentiating efficiency might decrease if cells are cultured for >5 consecutive passages (See troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCritical: Check the cultures at least every two weeks to rule out presence of mycoplasma and other contaminants. We recommend using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Cat# LT07-318).\nNote: Research involving hPSCs must be done in accordance with legal and ethical guidelines.\nAlternatives: E8 Essential Medium can be made in house using stock components (Chen et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). All components need to be as fresh as possible when the media is made to ensure high quality. We recommend making single-use aliquots and store them at their recommended storage temperature.\nDifferentiation into neural crest cells (NCCs)",
    "Timing: up to 12 days\nIn this section, we describe in detail the steps to differentiate hPSCs into NCCs with a SN fate. NCCs start to aggregate on day 4, and by day 8 dark aggregates (“ridges”) are visible under a brightfield microscope (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, 1B, and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Additionally, NCCs start expressing SN markers as early as day 4 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1517-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Characterization of NCC stage\n(A) Expected phenotypes of properly differentiated NCCs. Brightfield images of NCCs were taken on the indicated days (top panel). Arrows show growth and progression of NCC “ridges”, which start to form on day 4. Expression of NCC markers. NCCs were fixed on the indicated days and stained for SOX10 (green), TFAP2A (red), and DAPI (blue). Images were taken at two different magnifications (middle and bottom panels).\n(B) Appropriate seeding density. H9 cells were seeded at a density of 200,000 cell/cm2 (day 0). The next day (day 1) brightfield images were taken to show the expected density (>80% confluency).\n(C) Expression of SOX10 mRNA by RT-qPCR. n=4 (biological replicates), one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons. Graph show mean ± S.D. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.\n(D) Expected phenotypes of improper NCC differentiation. Brightfield images were taken on day 12. Note small size of the NCC “ridges” (red arrows left and middle images) or the formation of a single large NCC cluster (red arrow, right image), which will cause a very low differentiation efficiency. Also, note the presence of large blister-like cells/aggregates (black arrows, left and right images), the identity of which we do not know at this point.",
    "Note: It is important to carry out a parallel differentiation at the NCC stage for quality control (QC) purposes in a small format (4-well plate). This allows isolation of RNA and/or perform immunofluorescence (on day 6 or 8) from a plate that will be treated in the same way as the main plate.\nAspirate E8 media from the 10 cm dish of undifferentiated, ready to split hPSCs.\nWash once with ∼10 mL DPBS.\nAdd 4 mL EDTA Dissociation solution to a 10-cm dish, incubate for 15 min at 37°C.\nNote: Do not aspirate the EDTA Dissociation solution. The hPSCs colonies will be dissociated and resuspended into single cells and the EDTA Dissociation solution will be cloudy.\nUse 10 mL DPBS to wash off the cells. Most or all cells should be resuspended or detach from the plate rather easily at this point.\nTransfer the cells into a 50 mL conical tube and add an additional 10 mL DPBS.\nSpin down at 200×g for 4 min.\nResuspend in 5 mL NCC Differentiation media 1.\nCount cells using a Countess II or hematocytometer:\nMix 10 μL Trypan blue (Corning) with 10 μL of cell suspension.\nMix by pipetting and put 10 μL in a counting slide (ThermoFisher, Cat# C10312).\nCount the cells.\nNote: Resuspend 0.5 − 1 × 106 cells in 500 μL TRIZOL for RNA for day 0.\nAspirate VTN from the 6-well plate (NCC differentiation plate).\nTransfer 10.8 × 106 cells (to seed one 6-well plate at a density of 200,000 cells/cm2) to a 15 mL conical tube and fill with NCC Differentiation media 1 up to 12 mL.\nNote: A total of 10.8 × 106 cells are needed for a one 6-well plate, thus we recommend growing one 10 cm dish of H9 cells per 6-well plate.",
    "Plate 2 mL of the cell suspension directly onto each of the VTN-coated wells (do not let it dry before seeding the cells).\nIncubate at 37°C for 16–20 h.\nOn the next day (day 1), replace media with 3 mL per well of NCC Differentiation media 1.\nTake a picture for your records of cell density. High density is desired (>80%) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nIncubate at 37°C for 16–20 h.\nThe following day (day 2), replace media (3 mL/well) of NCC Differentiation media 2.\nChange media every 2 days until day 6 for inducing mechanoreceptors or day 12 for obtaining all three neuronal types:\nTo generate mainly mechanoreceptors, on day 6 follow the steps in the section “Differentiation into SNs (mechanoreceptor enrichment)”. Step 22.\nTo generate nociceptors, mechanoreceptors, and proprioceptors, on day 12 follow the steps in the section “Differentiation into SNs (nociceptors, mechanoreceptors, and proprioceptors)”. Step 40.\nOn day 8, harvest RNA from 4-well quality control plate:\nAspirate the media from one well.\nLyse the cells in 500 μL TRIZOL.\nCritical: do not wash cells with PBS as this could cause mRNA degradation.\nAlternatives: The quality control plate can be fixed for immunofluorescence staining.\nTake pictures on every feeding day to follow proper progression (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nNote: It is normal to see some cell aggregates (“ridges”) starting on day 4 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), which overlaps with an increase of SOX10 expression at the mRNA and protein levels (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2C) (See troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nCritical: If there is no clear formation of NCC ridges (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D), it is best to stop the differentiation because the SN yield will be too low or the presence of contaminant cells will be too high to perform any subsequent analysis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). See troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1517-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Characterization of SNs",
    "(A) Expected phenotypes of SNs obtained from day-6 NCCs. Cells were fixed 8 days post-replated and stained for TUJ1, the panSN-marker BRN3A, and the mechanoreceptor-specific markers RET and TRKB.\n(B) Expected phenotypes of SNs obtained from day-12 NCCs. Brightfield images (top) and immunofluorescent (bottom) images of SNs on day 16 and 20. For immunofluorescence, SNs were fixed on the indicated days and stained for TUJ1 (green), BRN3A (red), and DAPI (blue).\n(C) Expression of the pan-SN marker BRN3A mRNA by RT-qPCR. n=4 (biological replicates), one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons. Graph show mean ± S.D. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.\n(D) Representative images of failed differentiations. On day 12, NCCs showing suboptimal phenotypes (low number or complete lack of ridges) were replated. On the indicated days, brightfield images were taken (left) or fixed and stained (right). Fixed SNs were stained for αSMA (green), TUJ1 (red), and DAPI (blue). Note the low number of dendrites and the presence of a high number of non-neural ectoderm cells (arrows).\nDifferentiation into SNs (mechanoreceptor enrichment)\nTiming: ≥ 8 days\nHere we describe the steps to differentiate NCCs into sensory neurons with an enrichment of mechanoreceptors. By replating on day 6, you will obtain a majority of mechanoreceptors which aggregate in ganglia-like structures. SNs express pan-SN marker BRN3A as well as the mechanoreceptor markers RET and TRKB (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). In these conditions, SNs can be maintained for at least 30 days.\nNote: This protocol details the differentiation of one 24-well plate of SNs from three wells of the 6-well plate of differentiated NCCs. The volumes will need to be scaled up if more plates are needed.\nOn day 6 of the NC differentiation, wash each of the three designated wells of the 6-well plate with 1 mL DPBS.",
    "Note: The remaining three wells will be processed on step 40.\nAspirate DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL/well Accutase and incubate at 37°C for 20 min (or until the cells start to detach).\nAdd 1 mL DPBS to each well to resuspend the cells and transfer them to a 50 mL conical tube using a p1000.\nFill up with DPBS.\nCentrifuge, 200×g, 5 min, RT.\nResuspend the cells in 30 mL DPBS by pipetting up to six times using a 5 mL pipette, trying to gently break up the clumps.\nAdd 150 μL DNaseI (from a 10 mg/mL stock) and mix by inversion.\nCentrifuge, 200×g, 5 min, RT.\nResuspend in 5 mL of SN Differentiation media + 1 μM DAPT.\nGently break all the clumps by pipetting with a p1000 (<6 times).\nCount cells.\nAspirate LM/FN mixture from the PO/LM/FN-coated 24-well plate.\nTransfer 12 × 106 cells (to seed one 24-well plate at a density of 250,000 cells/cm2) and fill up to 12 mL with SN Differentiation media + 1 μM DAPT.\nAdd 0.5 mL of the cell suspension to each well of the 24-well plate.\nCritical: replating is necessary to increase the differentiation efficiency.\nPause point: Resuspended NCCs can be cryopreserved at a concentration of 5 × 106 cell in 1 mL NCC Differentiation media 2 containing 10% DMSO. The viability using this method is ∼15%. Commercially available freezing reagent (such as STEM-CELLBANKER, amsbio, cat# 11890) provide a better viability (∼70%).\nIncubate cells at 37°C for 16–20 h.\nOn the next day, aspirate the media and add 1 mL SN Differentiation media + 1 μM DAPT per well of the 24-well plate.",
    "Critical: Media should be added to the walls of the wells slowly. Avoid adding the media directly to the SNs as this can cause detachment of the newly plated cells (See troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nReplace the media every 2–3 days until day ∼30.\nNote: After day 14 (eight days post-replating), the number of SOX10+ progenitor cells will decrease so DAPT can be removed from the SN Differentiation media (See troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]). If a high number of non-neural ectoderm cells arise, please see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nDifferentiation into SNs (nociceptors, mechanoreceptors, and proprioceptors)\nTiming: ≥ 8 days\nHere, we describe the steps to differentiate NCCs into SNs at a DRG-like ratio. By replating on day 12, you will obtain a mixed peripheral SN population of nociceptors, mechanoreceptors, and proprioceptors. SNs aggregate in ganglia-like structures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). In these conditions, SNs can be maintained for over 90 days. SNs can also be replated a second time after day 16 for additional experiments or to maintain them for a longer time period (Saito-Diaz et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: This protocol details the differentiation of one 24-well plate of SNs from the three remaining wells of one 6-well plate of differentiated NCCs.\nNote: these steps need to be carried out on day 12 and continue from step 21\nOn day 12 of the NC differentiation, wash each well with 1 mL DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL/well Accutase and incubate at 37°C for 20 min (or until the cells start to detach).\nAdd 1 mL DPBS to each well to resuspend the cells and transfer them to a 50 mL conical tube using a p1000.\nFill up with DPBS.\nCentrifuge, 200×g, 5 min, RT.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 30 mL DPBS.",
    "Resuspend the cells by pipetting up to six times using a 5 mL pipette, trying to gently break up the clumps.\nAdd 150 μL DNaseI (from a 10 mg/mL stock) and mix by inversion.\nCentrifuge, 200×g for 5 min at RT.\nResuspend in 5 mL of SN Differentiation media + 1 μM DAPT using a 5 mL pipette.\nGently break all the clumps by pipetting with a p1000 (<6 times).\nCount cells.\nAspirate LM/FN mix from the PO/LM/FN-coated 24-well plate.\nTransfer 12 × 106 cells (for one 24-well plate at a density of 250,000 cells/cm2) to a 15 mL conical tube and fill up to 12 mL with SN Differentiation media + 1 μM DAPT.\nAdd 0.5 mL to the cell suspension (from step 49) to each well of the 24-well plate.\nCritical: replating is necessary to increase the differentiation efficiency.\nPause point: Resuspended NCCs can be cryopreserved using NCC Differentiation media 2 (see above for details on how to prepare the media) containing 10% DMSO or commercially available freezing reagents (see step 36). We recommend freezing at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 16–20 h.\nNext day, aspirate the media and add 1 mL SN Differentiation media + 1 μM DAPT to each well.\nCritical: Media should be added to the walls of the wells slowly. Avoid adding the media directly to the SNs as this can cause detachment of the newly plated cells (See troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nReplace the media every 2–3 days until day 30. After 30 days, media can be changed every five days.",
    "Note: After day 20 (eight days post-replating), DAPT is not necessary in the SN Differentiation media (see above for details). See troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]. If a high number of non-neural ectoderm cells arise, please see troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nNote: SNs can be replated a second time after day 16. This can be used as an axotomy model (Saito-Diaz et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). To do so: 1) Wash SNs with DPBS, followed by incubation at 37°C with Accutase for at least 1 h. 2) Transfer the cells to a 50 mL conical tube with 30 mL DPBS and centrifuge it at 200x g for 4 min at RT. 3) Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of SN Differentiation media using a p1000 micropipette to break all the clumps. 4) Add 4 mL of SN Differentiation media. 5) Count the cells and replate at a density of 250,000 cells/cm2 on a PO/LM/FN plate (see above). 6) Change the media the next day."
