    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nNote: A dozen of other nucleases have been tested (Marshall et al. ,2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Tens of gRNAs have been also tested on P70a-deGFP and other E. coli promoters (Marshall et al. ,2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), using the method shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/15-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of the TXTL CRISPR Assay\nSchematic of the experiment and location of some of the guide RNAs (sg 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) that have been tested on P70a-deGFP, data from (Marshall et al. ,2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPre-incubate the 96 V-bottom well plate with sealing mat at 29°C for at least 30 min prior to the reactions being pipetted into the plate in step 7. Pre-incubation can be done either in the plate reader at 29°C or in a small incubator at 29°C, concurrently with the preparation of the reactions.\nCritical: This step is necessary to start reactions at the optimum temperature of 29°C and to avoid bias in the kinetics due to variable times needed to heat the plate (i.e. heating the plate from room temperature to 29°C).\nRetrieve DNA (stored at −20°C) and make sgRNA DNA stocks for each of six sgRNA targets (including the non-target) at 10 nM in water. Make a dSpyCas9 plasmid stock at 100 nM in water. Make a P70a-deGFP plasmid stock at 100 nM in water.\nNote: See Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#krt] for calculations of mass and concentrations of DNA.\n1 bp of linear or circular dsDNA = 617.9 g/mol on average\n1 μg/μl of 1 kbp circular or linear dsDNA = 1.62 μM\nThe concentration of a 4 kbp plasmid at 1 μg/μl = 405 nM\n1 bp of linear or circular ssDNA = 308.5 g/mol on average\n1 μg/μl of 1 kb circular or linear ssDNA = 3.24 μM",
    "Retrieve the myTXTL mix from the −80°C freezer. Thaw the mix on ice. Vortex gently and spin a few seconds at room temperature in a minifuge. Return the tube to ice. One myTXTL mix contains 75 μl of mix, with a final volume of 100 μl once DNA, water, and other components are added. This one mix is sufficient for 8 reactions of 12 μl.\nKeep the tube on ice, add components present in all reactions to the myTXTL mix and complete with water to 90% (90 μl) so the sgRNA DNA can be added later (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_15_1.csv\nAdd 3 μl of pCB453 at 100 nM to the myTXTL mix (3 nM final concentration).\nAdd 1 μl of P70a-deGFP at 100 nM to the myTXTL mix (1 nM final concentration).\nAdd 2 μl of Chi6 (or GamS) at 100 μM to the myTXTL mix (2 μM final concentration).\nAdd 9 μl water to bring the volume to 90 μl, which corresponds to 90% of the final volume.\nVortex gently and spin a few seconds at room temperature on a minifuge.\nThe next steps are done at room temperature before loading the well plate in the plate reader.\nAliquot 10.8 μl to eight 1.5 mL tubes.\nIn each tube, add 1.2 μl of a different sgRNA at 10 nM (1 nM final concentration). Vortex gently.\nCritical: Include a negative control (non-targeting sgRNA: sgRNA-NT, which does not inactivate transcription). For a positive control, use sg9 (strong inactivation of deGFP expression).\nCritical: To perform quantitative measurements, the same amounts of similar DNA (e.g. targeting or non-targeting sgRNA) must be used. It is also necessary to include a reaction that contains all the components except DNA to measure background fluorescence.",
    "For each 12 μl reaction, pipette 5 μl into each of two wells (5 μl per replicate) of the 96-well plate.\nLoad the pre-warmed plate in the plate reader and start the kinetics. On a Biotek H1m plate reader, the excitation is fixed at 485 nm, the emission at 525 nm, the time lapse between reads is typically 3 min for 16 h.\nRepeat the entire protocol as necessary for replicates."
