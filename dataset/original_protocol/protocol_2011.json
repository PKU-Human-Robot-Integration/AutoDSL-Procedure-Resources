    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol describes four different steps in order to use D. melanogaster as an animal model to study Propionibacterium spp. biofilm in vivo: (1) generation and maintenance of GF D. melanogaster; (2) culture and preparation of Propionibacterium spp. biofilms; (3) oral infection of GF fruit flies; and (4) evaluation of the biofilm.\nGerm-free Drosophila melanogaster line generation\nFly food: modified Bloomington\nThe Bloomington media is prepared according to the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center instructions (BDSC, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) with some modifications in the composition.\nHeat and homogenize in tap water, one at a time, the ingredients listed in Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1607_6.csv\naRoutinely, this recipe is adjusted for an initial volume of 7 L tap water resulting in 7,4 L of media after the addition of all the ingredients to the water.\nbApproximate final concentrations after boiling, evaporation and addition of the last components (p-Hydroxy-benzoic acid methyl ester and propionic acid) from steps 2–5.\nStir the mixture until it boils and turn-off the heat source.\nLet the mixture cool down to 60°C.\nAdd 6 mL (for 1 L of media) of p-Hydroxy-benzoic acid methyl ester diluted in 95% ethanol and stir.\nNote: Adjust this volume according to the initial volume of tap water used. The approximate final concentration of p-Hydroxy-benzoic acid methyl ester in the media is 5,7‰ (v/v).\nAdd 10 mL (for 1 L of media) of propionic acid and stir.\nNote: Adjust this volume according to the initial volume of tap water used. The approximate final concentration of propionic acid in the media is 9,5‰ (v/v).\nDistribute manually 8 mL of media per vial and let cool down.\nCover vials with plastic wrap and store at 4°C until next step.\nPause point: Bloomington vials can be stored for a week at 4°C.",
    "Close each vial containing the food with a cotton ball and wrap it tightly with aluminum. Autoclave the vials and let them cool down at graspable temperature.\nCritical: From this step the user must work under sterile conditions throughout. All manipulations of the food should be performed in a sterile way, working with a Bunsen burner or BSC following good laboratory practices.\nMix well by vortexing thoroughly.\nSupplement the 8 mL of food with 1 mL of sterile sucrose (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nNote: If antibiotics are needed, they can be supplemented at the same time than the sucrose (Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]).\nMix the food with the supplements by pipetting three times up and down.\nPipette the entire mixture to a new sterile vial.\nNote: This step is to not have condensation and media on the vial wall due to autoclaving and mixing. On step 10 we recommend the use of a 10 mL pipette to add 1 mL sucrose and then to use the same pipette to mix (step 11) and transfer to a new vial (step 12).\nClose the vial with the cotton ball and aluminum foil. Let it cool down on ice until the food is fully solidified.\nNote: It is important to quickly solidify the food to get a homogenous media.\nStore the vials at 4°C.\nGeneration of germ-free Drosophila melanogaster\nTiming: 1.5–2 months\nThese steps detail how to develop GF line of D. melanogaster. The generation of GF fruit flies is a two months long procedure. Afterwards, the GF line can be maintained and crossed in a sterile way for further experiments.\nCritical: All fruit flies’ manipulations should be performed in BSC using sterile materials and media. Spray-off all materials with 70% ethanol before starting.",
    "Transfer D. melanogaster in a starving vial and incubate for 6 h at 25°C and 60% humidity.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1607-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Germ-free Drosophila melanogaster line generation\nGF fruit flies are obtained from WT fruit flies after three generations (G1, G2 and G3) of washing and raising on sterile media with antibiotics (steps 15–26). Blue arrows show steps for the generation of GF fruit flies. Red arrows correspond to GF fruit flies. All steps should be performed in a BSC in sterile conditions.\nNote: The procedure (from steps 15–25) is repeated three times in order to generate GF fruit flies. Step 15 initially starts with wild-type (WT) non-sterile D. melanogaster, followed two times by the fruit flies generated in step 26 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: Fruit flies’ fertility declines with age, start the experiment with young fruit flies (< 3 days old).\nAfter starving, place the vial on ice to anesthetize fruit flies.\nWash fruit flies with a sterile washing kit (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAdd 2 mL of 70% ethanol to the vial and quickly filter fruit flies through a cell strainer.\nWash by immersing the cell strainer for 2 min in a Petri dish containing 2,7% sodium hypochlorite.\nFlush with 70% ethanol.\nImmerse the cell strainer with the fruit flies for 10 min in a Petri dish containing autoclaved milli-Q water.\nPlace the cell strainer on the blotting paper to absorb the excess of water.\nNote: Pipette all the liquids with sterile plastic transfer pipettes.\nLet the fruit flies air dry in the BSC by covering the cell strainer with an empty vial.\nNote: Air dry fruit flies until they no longer stick to each other or to surfaces of the cell strainer (approximately 10 min).\nNote: after step 17, fruit flies are anesthetized due to all the washing steps.",
    "Transfer fruit flies in an empty sterile vial to let them recover (between 15–30 min).\nTransfer fruit flies into a vial with 2 mL BHIAgsy supplemented with antibiotics.\nNote: Transfer fruit flies when they are fully conscious and mobile. If they are still anesthetized during the transfer they will stick to the medium. Place vials sideways to let the fruit flies recover.\nIncubate for 18–24 h at 25°C and 60% humidity.\nCollect and dechorionated fruit flies’ eggs with a new washing kit.\nRemove fruit flies from the vial.\nNote: Dispose adults flies following the recommendations presented in the step “Fruit flies disposal”.\nAdd 2 mL of sterile water.\nGently brush the surface of the media to collect eggs.\nTransfer the mixture (water and eggs) into a cell strainer.\nRepeat steps 22.a–22.d if there are eggs left on the media surface.\nWash eggs in the cell strainer.\nImmerse the cell strainer in a Petri dish containing 2,7% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min.\nWash with 70% ethanol.\nImmerse the cell strainer into a Petri dish with water for 10 min.\nTake out the cell strainer from the water.\nTransfer washed eggs with a plastic transfer pipette to fresh autoclaved modified Bloomington food supplemented with antibiotics.\nIncubate the vial at 25°C and 60% humidity until new fruit flies hatch.\nNote: Depending on the environmental conditions and quality of the fruit flies, the duration of life cycle of fruit fly can vary. A delay in fly growth and size has been noticed with GF fruit flies. In the conditions tested larva should start moving and growing on the media 2–3 days after eggs collection. Fruit flies start hatching after about 15 days.\nRepeat two more-time steps 15–25 starting with the newly hatched fruit flies from step 25 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Note: When pupa start to hatch, collect young fruit flies each day into a BHIAgsy vial supplemented with antibiotics. Collect the fruit flies for three days before repeating the step 15.\nAfter three generations (G1, G2, G3; Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) fruit flies are considered sterile and can be used as an in vivo model.\nNote: Validation of the germ-free status can be performed both with culturing and molecular methods and is documented in our recent publication (Bronnec and Alexeyev, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPause point: After the third generation, GF fruit flies can be maintained and crossed on sterile food with antibiotics until the desired number of young GF fruit flies is reached (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]; troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nPropionibacterium spp. biofilm preparation\nTiming: 11 days\nIn natural environment, biofilm dispersion also known as “seeding dispersal” is the last step of the biofilm formation facilitating the colonization of new sites and the development of a new biofilm (Rumbaugh and Sauer, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). In this protocol, sessile Propionibacterium spp. are used to infect GF fruit flies instead of planktonic cells in order to enhance the biofilm formation inside their gut.\nNote: This protocol has been optimized to develop mono-species biofilm of Propionibacterium spp.\nNote: Propionibacterium spp. cultures are performed in anaerobic environment. Plates and flasks are incubated in jars with an anaerobic atmosphere generation sachet. Planktonic cultures are performed in a 10 mL tube fully filled and closed. All incubations are performed in a laboratory incubator at 37°C with an agitation of 250 rpm for planktonic cultures.\nCritical: The user must work under sterile conditions throughout following usual good microbiological laboratories practices. Use a Bunsen burner or BSC when working with Propionibacterium spp. (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nPlating Propionibacterium spp.\nSlightly scratch the surface of frozen Propionibacterium spp. glycerol stock with a sterile inoculating loop.",
    "Streak the loop across a blood agar plate.\nInvert and incubate the plates at 37°C for 72 h anaerobically.\nPreculture of Propionibacterium spp.\nPick-up one colony from the plate from step 28.c with a sterile inoculating loop and inoculate 10 mL of BHIg.\nIncubate at 37°C with 250 rpm agitation for 48 h anaerobically.\nCulture of Propionibacterium spp.\nInoculated 9,5 mL of BHIg in a T-25 cell culture flask with 500 μL of the preculture from step 29.b.\nIncubate the flask horizontally at 37°C for 6 days anaerobically with a medium change every 48 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1607-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Biofilm of Propionibacterium spp in T-25 cell culture flask\nTo let the biofilm pelleted at the corner of the flask by gravity (to change the media or to recover the biofilm), the flask is tilted for about 10 min between 18°C and 25°C.\n(A and D) An in-house-built system is used to create an angle (a square tissue culture dish and a lid of a pipet tips box).\n(B and E) close-up of (A) and (D) respectively. (B) The biofilm is pelleted at the corner of the flak and the media should appear clear.\n(C) After media changes (about 8 mL removed and 10 mL BHIg added) the biofilm is visible at the corner of the flask.\n(D–F) When the culture is contaminated or if the culture has been shaken, the media appears turbid and no biofilm is visible.\nNote: To change the media, tilt the flask (± 45° angle) for about 10 min to let the biofilm pelleted at the corner of the flask by gravity (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). Without disturbing the pellet (lowest speed of the Pipetboy), carefully pipette the supernatant (about 8 mL) and discard it. Add slowly 10 mL of BHIg.\nOral infection of Drosophila melanogaster",
    "Timing: 10 days\nPreparation of fruit flies before infection.\nUse newly born to 3-days-old GF fruit flies from the step 27.\nNote: The population density is approximately 30 fruit flies per vials.\nTransfer fruit flies two times for 24 h on BHIAgsy supplemented with antibiotics and incubate at 25°C and 60% humidity.\nTransfer fruit flies on BHIAgsy without antibiotics and incubate for 24 h.\nRecover the 6-days old biofilm of Propionibacterium spp. formed at the bottom of the T-25 culture flask (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B; troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nTilt the flask (± 45° angle) for about 10 min to let the biofilm pelleted by gravity.\nPipet slowly 1 mL of the biofilm at the corner of the flask and transfer it to a sterile 1,5 mL micro-tube.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 1,150 g between 18°C and 25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant by pipetting and resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of BHIs by pipetting up and down.\nPipette 100 μL of the concentrated biofilm suspension on the filter of an infection vial.\nLet the filter dry/absorb for 30 min.\nTransfer fruit flies from step 31.c and incubate for 24 h (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nRepeat the infection procedure (step 32) using the fruit flies from step 33 every 24 h for 6 days.\nAfter 6 days of infection, transfer the fruit flies on BHIAgsy without antibiotics and incubate for 24 h.\nNote: This step is to let fruit flies to shed unattached bacteria.\nFormalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples and sectioning\nTiming: 3–4 days\nFruit flies sacrifice.\nAnesthetize fruit flies on ice.\nPlace them into a fine pore tissue cassette using forceps.\nPlace the small cassette in a larger tissue embedding cassette.\nNote: Grab the fruit flies wings to not damage their abdomen.",
    "Note: Label the tissue embedding cassette on the angular writing area as well as the side of the cassette with a pencil. Markers are erased with solvents during formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) procedure.\nCritical: From steps 37–40 the work must be done under chemical fume hood, the user must wear personal protections and follow his laboratory procedures and guidelines when working with hazardous chemicals. The user should consult product safety data sheet for the chemical substances used.\nNote: FFPE steps are performed between 18°C and 25°C. Fruit flies are placed in a tissue embedding cassette to keep them submerged in liquids during all the procedure. Liquid solutions are in specimen containers with a volume of 50 mL of liquids for maximum five embedding cassettes. Tighten the lid to close the container after immersion of the cassette.\nImmerse the cassette in buffered formalin (or fixative alternative) in a specimen container for at least 12 h (long enough for it to penetrate through every part of the specimen).\nRinse two times 10 min with PBS 1X.\nNote: PBS 1X is prepared by diluting 10 times PBS 10X (CSHProtocols, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) in sterile milli-Q water.\nDehydrate with serial baths of ethanol by transferring tissue embedding cassettes from one container to another:\nTwo baths of 1 h each with 70% ethanol.\nOne bath of 1 h with 80% ethanol.\nOne bath of 1 h with 90% ethanol.\nThree baths of 1,5 h each with 100% ethanol.\nNote: Before dehydration steps, dilute absolute ethanol in sterile milli-Q water to freshly prepare 70%, 80% and 90% ethanol solutions.\nPerform tissue clearing with 3 baths of Xylene for 1,5 h each.",
    "Note: Substitutes are available as an alternative to Xylene but we did not test these clearing agents: HistoChoice® Clearing Agent (Sigma Aldrich, Cat#H2779) or Xylene Substitute (Sigma Aldrich, Cat#A5597).\nTo infiltrate the tissue with paraffin, immerse the sample two times 2 h in paraffin wax for tissue embedding (58°C–60°C) and cast the sample in paraffin blocks stainless steel embedding molds.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1607-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded blocks and sections\n(A and B) Correct positioning of fruit flies in the paraffin block. The gray area (B) shows the excess of paraffin to trim with a scalpel before sectioning in order to place more sections on one slide.\n(C) A paraffin block with too many fruit flies, some appears damaged.\n(D) Fruit fly embedded in a rectangular mold (less paraffin to trim).\n(E) Correct placement of sections on a slide to be processed for immunofluorescence staining. The blue circle on the bottom slide shows how the hydrophilic border can be drawn after deparaffinization. During immunostaining, solution (steps 49–51, 53, 55 and 56) should be added within the circle.\n(F) Placement suitable for visualization without processing but fruit flies are too close to the edge of the slide to draw a hydrophilic border for a staining procedure.\nNote: The infection experiment starts with 30 fruit flies per vial. During the infection procedure, some will die. The user should determine how many blocks to prepare according to his scientific question and the number of replicates wanted. We recommend a number of 4–6 flies per paraffin block, a low number is easier to cast in paraffin and to process (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Orientation of fruit flies in the block is not critical.\nPause point: After preparation, FFPE blocks are stored at 4°C (alternatively they can be stored between 18°C and 25°C).",
    "Cut the FFPE blocks at 4 μm using a microtome. Follow a general microtome cutting procedure.\nNote: Paraffin blocks should always be cold before cutting (stored at 4°C or chilled on a cold surface).\nNote: Use high quality, disposable and sharp blades.\nTransfer each section to a 45°C water bath using fine forceps.\nNote: Use clean milli-Q water in the flotation bath and dislodged air bubbles with a painting brush before sectioning.\nPick-up floating section with a slide. Use highly adhesive slides for immunofluorescence or regular slides if unprocessed visualization is planned.\nNote: Pick-up the section immediately, do not let it stand on the water bath, the sample cracks easily.\nNote: If needed several sections can be placed on one slide if excess of paraffin is trimmed (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, 4E, and 4F).\nDrain the water with a tissue and let the slides dry vertically in a staining rack between 18°C and 25°C for at least 12 h.\nNote: The user should label the slides with a pencil. Several immersion steps are performed and permanent markers are erased with solvents.\nIn vivo biofilm visualization\nIn the present protocol, two methods of visualization are presented: (i) deparaffinization and immunostaining to visualize specifically Propionibacterium spp., (ii) unprocessed slides observation to evaluate biofilm distribution.\nSpecific observation using immunolabeling\nTiming: 2 days\nDeparaffinization and rehydration of sections.\nPlace the slides from step 45 on a slide staining rack.\nMelt the paraffin by incubating the slides at 60°C for 1 h.\nNote: All the baths for slides described hereafter are performed by immersing the entire rack in staining jars containing the different solutions.",
    "Critical: Samples detach easily from the slide. After the paraffin is melted, baths for deparaffinization and rehydration should be gentle. Do not shake the rack in the solution nor tap it on the edge of the container to remove excess liquids (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nImmerse the slides two times for 10 min in xylene to deparaffinize.\nRehydrate by immersing the slides in the following solutions:\n100% ethanol 2 min.\n70% ethanol 2 min.\n30% ethanol 2 min.\nWash the slides by immersing the rack two times 5 min in PBS 1X.\nDraw a circle with a hydrophobic barrier pen around slide-mounted tissue to create a water-repellent barrier (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nNote: On steps 49–51, 53, 55 and 56 the volume of the drop added to the tissue depends on the initial repartition of the flies in the paraffin block and the size of the circle draw in step 48 with the hydrophobic barrier pen. A good placement of the fruit flies in the paraffin block is presented in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nNote: During incubation steps (49–51, 53, 55 and 56), slides are placed horizontally in a moist chamber (cover the bottom with a thin layer of distilled water).\nCritical: Do not add the drop directly on fruit flies’ tissues to not damage the sample. Apply the drop on the glass and let it gently cover the tissues.\nCritical: Between each incubation steps (49–55), gently tap the edge of the slide against a paper towel to remove excess reagent before adding the next one.\nPerform antigen retrieval by treating the hydrated tissue sections with proteinase K (25 μg/mL) for 15 min at 37°C.\nAdd normal horse serum blocking solution and incubate 20 min between 18°C and 25°C.",
    "Apply the primary antibody on the fruit flies’ tissues and incubate for 1 h between 18°C and 25°C.\nNote: In the protocol herein, we use the following antibodies depending on the species used to infect the GF fruit flies: mouse monoclonal anti-P. acnes, chicken polyclonal anti-P. granulosum, rabbit polyclonal anti-P. avidum.\nNote: Antibodies dilutions are performed in normal horse serum blocking solution and used at 1/400, 1/10,000 and undiluted for anti-P. granulosum, anti-P. avidum and anti-P. acnes antibodies respectively.\nWash the slides by immersing the rack two times 5 min in PBS 1X.\nApply the secondary antibody and incubate for 1 h between 18°C and 25°C in the moist chamber and protect from light.\nNote: The conjugate used on step 53 depend on the primary antibody used in step 51. They are labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (orange fluorescence), Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence) or Alexa Fluor 647 (red fluorescence).\nNote: Secondary antibodies are diluted in normal horse serum blocking solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nWash the slides by immersing the rack two times 5 min in PBS 1X.\nAdd a drop of DAPI (4 μg/mL) on fruit flies’ tissues and incubate for 2 min.\nAdd drop of glycerol/PBS antifade.\nCover the sample with a coverslip starting from one side of the sample and drop it quickly on the sample to avoid air bubbles.\nSeal the edges with a coverslip sealant.\nStore the slides in darkness (to avoid photobleaching) and at 4°C.\nTake image of the slides as soon as possible not to lose the quality of fluorescence.\nNote: Slides are usually stable for several weeks.\nCapture images using an epifluorescence or confocal microscope using appropriate wavelength.",
    "Note: DAPI and secondary antibodies with Alexa Fluor 488, 555, 647 have been use to labeled the samples. Immunostained sections were analyzed on a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope using 10×/0.3, 20×/0.8 and 63×/1.4 oil objectives. Images were captured with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 LT digital CMOS camera. Visualization of DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488, 555 and 647 was achieved simultaneously in each slide by using Zeiss Filter Set 01 (ex: BP 365/12, em: LP39738), HE (Ex: 470/40, Em: 525/50), 43 (Ex: 545/25, Em: 605/70) and 50 (Ex: 640/30, Em: 690/50). Image processing was performed using the ZEN software (Carl Zeiss Vision, Germany).\nUnprocessed slides observation\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis step can be performed when the procedure has been validated with immunofluorescence first. With unprocessed slides the biofilm appears as a large compact structure. The specificity of the bacteria present in the biofilm should be initially confirmed with immunofluorescence.\nSlides from the step 58 can be directly observed without deparaffinization and without staining using a light microscope."
