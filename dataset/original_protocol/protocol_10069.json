    "All methods have been approved by the Ethics Committee of Bar Ilan University.\n1. Fabrication of Oxidized PSi (PSiO2) Carriers\nCut a Si wafer (single side polished on the <100> face and heavily Boron-doped, p-type, 0.95 mΩ·cm) into 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm samples using a diamond-tipped pen.\nOxidize the Si samples in a tube furnace at 400 °C for 2 h in ambient air (heating rate: 25 °C/min, natural cooling).\nImmerse the Si samples in a solution of aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF) (48%), ddH2O and ethanol (99.9%) (1:1:3 v/v/v) for 5 min; then rinse the samples with ethanol three times and dry under a nitrogen stream.\n\tNOTE: Prepare and store HF solution in plasticware only, as HF dissolves glass.\n\tCAUTION: HF is a highly corrosive liquid, and it should be handled with extreme care. In case of exposure, rinse thoroughly with water and treat the affected area with HF antidote gel; seek for medical care immediately.\nMount the Si sample in a polytetrafluoroethylene etching cell, using a strip of aluminum foil as a back-contact and a platinum coil as the counter electrode.\nEtch a sacrificial layer in a 3:1 (v/v) solution of aqueous HF and ethanol (99.9%) for 30 s at a constant current density of 250 mA/cm2; then rinse the surface of the resulting PSi film with ethanol three times and dry under a nitrogen stream.\nDissolve the freshly-etched porous layer in an aqueous NaOH solution (0.1 M) for 2 min. Then rinse with ethanol three times and dry under a nitrogen stream.\nImmerse the sample in a solution of aqueous HF (48%), ddH2O and ethanol (99.9%) (1:1:3 v/v) for 2 min. Then rinse with ethanol three times and dry under a nitrogen stream.",
    "Electrochemically etch the Si sample in a 3:1 (v/v) solution of aqueous HF and ethanol (99.9%) for 20 s at a constant current density of 250 mA/cm2; then rinse the surface of the resulting PSi film with ethanol three times and dry under a nitrogen stream.\nThermally oxidize the freshly-etched PSi samples in a tube furnace at 800 °C for 1 h in ambient air (heating rate: 25 °C/min, natural cooling) to form a porous SiO2 (PSiO2) scaffold.\nSpin-coat the PSiO2 samples with a positive thick photoresist at 4,000 rpm for 1 min; then bake the coated samples at 90 °C for 2 min (heating rate: 5 °C/min, natural cooling).\nDice the PSiO2 samples into 8 mm × 8 mm samples using a dicing saw.\nTo remove the photoresist, soak the diced samples in acetone for 3 h; then thoroughly rinse with ethanol and dry under a nitrogen stream.\n2. Loading PSiO2 with NGF\nTo prepare the NGF loading solution, dissolve 20 µg of murine β-NGF in 400 µL of 1:1 (v/v) solution of 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and ddH2O.\nAdd 52 µL of the loading solution on top of the PSiO2 sample and incubate for 2 h at RT in a capped dish.\n\tNOTE: Maintain high humidity in the dish to prevent drying up of the solution during incubation.\nCollect the solution on the top of the sample for subsequent quantification of NGF content within the PSiO2 carrier.\n\tNOTE: NGF loading into PSiO2 should be performed immediately before the intended use, the protocol cannot be paused here due to the risk of drying and denaturation of the protein.\n3. Quantification of NGF loading by NGF ELISA",
    "To prepare the ELISA plate, add 100 µL of 0.5 µg/mL capture antibody (rabbit anti-hβ-NGF) to each well, seal the plate and incubate overnight at RT.\nAspirate the wells to remove liquid and wash the plate four times using 300 µL of wash buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) per well; after the last wash invert the plate to remove residual buffer and blot on a paper towel.\nAdd 300 µL of block buffer (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS) to each well and incubate for at least 1 h at RT. Then aspirate and wash the plate four times as described in step 3.2.\nTo prepare a calibration curve, dilute NGF loading solution (see step 2.1) in diluent (0.05% Tween-20, 0.1% BSA in PBS) to 1 ng/mL. Then perform 2-fold serial dilutions from 1 ng/mL to zero to obtain the calibration curve samples.\nTo prepare the samples, dilute the NGF loading solution (from step 2.1) and the collected post-loading solution (from step 2.3) in diluent 1:100,000 and 1:10,000 respectively, to reach the concentrations range of the ELISA kit in use (16-1,000 pg/mL).\nAdd 100 µL of the diluted samples and calibration curve samples to each well in triplicate and incubate at RT for 2 h; then aspirate and wash the plate four times as described in step 3.2.\nAdd 100 µL of 1 µg/mL detection antibody (biotinylated rabbit anti-hβ-NGF) to each well and incubate at RT for 2 h. Then aspirate and wash the plate four times as described in step 3.2.\nDilute Avidin-Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) 1:2,000 in diluent, add 100 µL per well and incubate for 30 min at RT. Now aspirate and wash the plate four times as described in step 3.2.",

Measure the absorbance at 405 nm with wavelength correction set at 650 nm using a microplate reader.\nDetermine NGF concentration in both the loading solution and the collected post-loading solution based on the calibration curve.\nTo calculate NGF mass loaded within PSiO2 carrier, subtract NGF mass in the collected post-loading solution from the NGF mass in loading solution. NGF loading efficacy is calculated by the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58982/58982eq1.jpg\n4.

Freeze the collected release samples in liquid nitrogen and store at -20 °C for further analyses.\nUse the commercially available NGF ELISA assay to quantify NGF content in the release samples as described in steps 3.1-3.9.\n\tNOTE: When preparing the release samples for ELISA quantification, different dilutions should be performed for different time points along the release period (i.e., earlier time points should be diluted much more than later time points). Moreover, for each release sample, at least two different dilutions should be performed and quantified to ensure reaching the concentrations range of the ELISA kit.\nDetermine NGF concentration in the release samples based on the calibration curve and plot a graph of accumulative NGF release over time.\n5. Quantification of in vitro Si Erosion by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES)",

Summing the cumulative Si content along the release period and the Si content in the post-release samples provides the 100% of Si content.\n6.
