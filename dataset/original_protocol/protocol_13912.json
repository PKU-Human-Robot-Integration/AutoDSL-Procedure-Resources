  "procedures": [
    "All patients provided written informed consent prior to hair sample collection. We obtained Institutional Review Board approval from the University of Cape Town and the University of California, San Francisco.\n1. Hair sampling\nObtain written informed consent.\nUse clean scissors to cut approximately 20-30 scalp hair strands from the occipital region as close to the scalp as possible.\nPlace tape around the distal side of the hair to indicate directionality. Fold hair sample into an aluminum foil square and store at room temperature. Label the distal end of the hair to avoid possible contamination from additional handling of the proximal end.\nIn addition to patient samples, collect “blank hair”: a scalp hair sample from someone who has not taken TB medication. Collect a large amount (>30 mg blank hair for each 20 patient samples).\n2. Drug extraction\nLabel bead tubes. Each patient sample requires one tube. Label 12 tubes from “C0” to “C11”, one for each of the 12 calibration points. Label a tube for Low Quality Control, a tube for Medium Quality Control, and a tube for High Quality Control. Lastly, label a tube for Matrix Blank.\nOpen the aluminum foil square containing hair sample. If hair sample is longer than 3 cm, cut hair at 3 cm from the proximal end and use that proximal portion for analysis.\nWeigh 2 mg of the hair sample into a bead tube.\nWeigh 2 mg of blank hair into 16 additional bead tubes. These will be used as the calibration points, quality controls, and matrix blank. The tubes will follow the same extraction procedure as the patient samples, aside from being spiked with drug reference standards at levels indicated in steps 2.8 and 2.9.",
    "Place all of the bead tubes into the homogenizer. Run homogenizer at speed 6.95 m/s. Run for two cycles of 30 s each, with a 15 s rest period in between the two cycles.\nMake internal standard mix and add it to the samples.\n\t\nAdd ~40 mL of methanol to a 50 mL volumetric flask.\nIn amber glass vials, make the mixes of the internal standards shown in Table 1, using methanol as the solvent.\n\t\tNOTE: Methanol is very volatile. Leave all vials capped during this process to prevent loss due to evaporation.\nFrom those mixes, add the volume shown in Table 1 to the 50 mL volumetric flask. Then, fill the flask to 50 mL with methanol.\nCap and mix the volumetric flask. Add 500 μL of the mixture to each of the pulverized hair tubes, except for the matrix blank tube. Add 500 μL methanol to the matrix blank tube.\nMake reference standard mixes.\n\t\nConstitute neat reference standards of the following drugs with methanol to get the concentration shown in the table in step 2.7.2. Only 1 mL of the following concentrations is necessary.\nAdd 1768 μL of methanol to a vial, and then add the amounts of reference standard listed in Table 2 to the same vial to get 2 mL final volume. Label this vial “Ref Std Mix 1x”. Vortex.\nSpike 100 μL from “Ref Std Mix 1x” into 900 μL methanol in a new vial. Label this vial “Ref Std Mix 10x”. Vortex.\nSpike 100 μL from “Ref Std Mix 10x” into 900 μL methanol in a new vial. Label this vial “Ref Std Mix 100x”. Vortex.\nSpike 100 μL from “Ref Std Mix 100x” into 900 μL methanol in a new vial. Label this vial “Ref Std Mix 1000x”. Vortex.",
    "Spike the calibration curve tubes by adding the amount of Ref Std Mix described in Table 3.\nCreate QC mixes and spike quality control tubes.\n\t\nLabel 5 vials “QC-A” through “QC-E”.\nAdd the following amounts of methanol to the five labeled vials:\n\t\tQC-A: 990 μL\n\t\tQC-B: 940 μL\n\t\tQC-C: 950 μL\n\t\tQC-D: 980 μL\n\t\tQC-E: 950 μL\n\t\t \nUsing the 1 mg/mL drug stocks created in step 2.7.1, add 10 μL to the specific vials listed below. For the BDQ and CLF stocks, which are at 0.5 mg/mL, add 20 μL to the vials listed below.\n\t\tQC-A: PTH\n\t\tQC-B: EMB, CLF, BDQ, PTM\n\t\tQC-C: INH, LFX, LZD, MFX, PZA\n\t\tQC-D: PTH, EMB\n\t\tQC-E: CLF, BDQ, PTM\n\t\tNOTE: Some drugs are present in multiple mixes.\nLabel a vial as “QC-A df100”. Dilute 10 μL of QC-A into 990 μL methanol.\nLabel a vial as “Low QC stock”. Add 1832 μL methanol to this vial. Add the amounts of QC mixes detailed below:\n\t\tQC-A df100: 80 μL\n\t\tQC-B: 8 μL\n\t\tQC-C: 80 μL\n\t\t \nLabel a vial as “Mid QC stock”. Add 760 μL methanol to this vial. Add the amounts of QC mixes detailed below:\n\t\tQC-A df100: 800 μL\n\t\tQC-B: 40 μL\n\t\tQC-C: 400 μL\n\t\t \nLabel a vial as “High QC stock”. Add 1376 μL methanol to this vial. Add the amounts of QC mixes detailed below:\n\t\tQC-D: 160 μL\n\t\tQC-E: 320 μL\n\t\tMFX, 1mg/mL stock: 16 μL\n\t\tINH, 1mg/mL stock: 32 μL\n\t\tLFX, 1mg/mL stock: 32 μL\n\t\tLZD, 1mg/mL stock: 32 μL\n\t\tPZA, 1mg/mL stock: 32 μL\n\t\t \nSpike 10 μL Low QC stock into the Low QC bead tube.\nSpike 10 μL Mid QC stock into the Mid QC bead tube.\nSpike 10 μL High QC stock into the High QC bead tube.",
    "Place all tubes in hot shaker for 2 h at 37 °C. Shaking should be slow enough that the water does not splash up on to the tubes.\nRemove tubes from shaker. Transfer liquid from bead tubes into new microcentrifuge tubes. Label these microcentrifuge tubes in the same way.\nAdd 500 μL methanol to the old tubes. Cap and vortex.\nFor a second time, transfer liquid from the bead tubes into the corresponding microcentrifuge tube. It is okay to transfer pulverized hair. This will eventually be centrifuged out.\nCentrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes for 10 min at 2,800 x g.\nCarefully remove the liquid and transfer it into new centrifuge tubes with corresponding labels. Be careful not to disturb or transfer the hair pellet.\nEvaporate the liquid in the centrifuge tubes to dryness at 32 °C.\nReconstitute the samples by adding 200 μL of mobile phase A (HPLC-grade water with 1% formic acid) to the dry tubes. Vortex.\nTransfer the liquid to amber vials with 250 μL inserts.\n3. LC-MS/MS preparation\nMake one liter of mobile phase A (HPLC-grade water with 1% formic acid) by adding some HPLC-grade water to a one-liter volumetric flask. Then add 10 mL of >95% formic acid to that flask, and then fill to the line with HPLC-grade water.\n\t\nMake one liter of mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) by adding some acetonitrile to a one-liter volumetric flask. Then add 1 mL of >95% formic acid to that flask, and then fill to the line with acetonitrile.\nInstall a 2 x 100 mm column with 2.5 μm particle size and 100 Å pore size with polar endcapped, ether-linked phenyl beads fully made of porous silica in the column compartment. Ensure that column also has manufacturer recommended guard cartridge installed.",

    "Click Browse to navigate to the appropriate folder, and then highlight the data file and click the right-pointing arrow to move the data into the Selected area. Click Next.\nSelect Create New Method and click New. Input new quantitation method name and press Save and then Next.\nSelect the first injection of the middle calibration point. Press Next.\nTick mark all the transitions of the internal standards in the IS column.\nFor the quantifier transitions for the reference standards, select the corresponding IS in the IS Name column. Click Next.\nScroll through the transitions to assure that the automatically selected retention time is accurate. Make sure that Gaussian Smoothing is set to 1.5. All other default settings can remain as is (i.e., Noise Percentage 100%, Baseline Sub. Window 2.00 min, Peak Splitting 2 points).\n\t\tNOTE: If wanted, modify automatic integration parameters at this point. Since these parameters change based on instrument setup, we have not included ours here.\nClick Finish to apply the quantitation method to the batch.\nClick the top left Displays the peak review button to view chromatograms. Navigate through the transitions using the left sidebar. Scroll through each injection of every quantifier transition and manually integrate the correct peak if necessary.\n\t\nTo manually integrate a peak, click on the Enable manual integration mode button, zoom into the chromatogram by clicking and dragging along the x- or y-axis, and then draw a line from one baseline to the other baseline, defining the peak. Figure 3 shows two chromatograms: one that has INH, and therefore has been manually integrated, and another that does not have INH.",
    "NOTE: All injections must be integrated using the same parameters. Peak width can provide a guideline for adhering to these parameters, but sometimes peak width will differ. To quantify a peak, the retention time must be within ±0.15 min of the expected retention time for that analyte (as defined by the reference standard peaks), qualitatively confirmed as having the expected quantifier to qualifier ratio (as shown in Figure 2), and have a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than 10.\nIn the Sample Type column, set the calibration curve injections (with the exception of the blank calibration curve injections) to Standard. Set the quality control injections to Quality Control. Leave the remaining injections as Unknown.\n\tNOTE: This will be set across all transitions.\nIn the Actual Concentration column, type in the concentrations found in Table 5 for all calibration curve and quality control injections.\nClick the second from top left Displays the calibration curve button. Click the Regression button.\nSet Weighting Type to 1/x and press OK.\nValidate the calibration curve and quality control samples to assure that the batch ran successfully.\n\t\nFor each quantifier reference transition (not internal standard transitions), look at each calibration curve injection accuracy (in the Accuracy column). At least two-thirds of the calibration points must have an accuracy within 80-120%.\nFor calibration points far outside of the expected accuracy, the injection may be an outlier. Exclude outliers if their calculated concentration is more than two standard deviations away from the other two injections of that vial. Clicking the “et peak to ‘not found button above each chromatogram.\nCheck that the R-value displayed above the calibration curve is >0.975.\nCheck that all quality control injections have an accuracy within 80-120%.",
    "If all above conditions are satisfied, the batch has passed, and samples can be quantified. Click Edit in the toolbar, then click Copy entire table. Paste the table in a spreadsheet.\nTake the average of the calculated concentration of the two sample injections to determine the reported concentration of each sample.\nSubscription Required.
