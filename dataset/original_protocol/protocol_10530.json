    "1. Optical Lithography of Device Masters\nDehydrate clean silicon wafers on a hot plate at ~250 °C for at least 1 hr.\n\tNOTE: It is good practice to use more than one wafer when preparing a master, in case of user error.\nPrepare photoresist aliquots. Prepare aliquots of both SU-8 2015 photoresist and a dilution of SU-8 2015 photoresist in 2:1 ratio using SU-8 thinner as diluent.\n\tNOTE: Approximately 1 ml of photoresist is needed for spin-coating one wafer.\nPrepare three mask patterns for producing these masters. For the Membrane Master, prepare two masks: one patterning the membrane channel and the other patterning the reaction chambers. For the Control Valve master, prepare only one mask pattern.\n\tNOTE: For more details on lithographic techniques, including mask patterning, see Ito and Okazaki, 2000.36 See Fowlkes and Collier, 2013 for a more detailed description of device design.37\nPrepare the Membrane Master\n\t\nSpin-coat 2:1 SU-8 2015 photoresist dilution on wafers at 1,000 rpm for 45 sec.\nSoft bake wafers at 95 °C for 2 min. Using a contact aligner, expose wafers with membrane channel pattern for 10 sec, and perform a post-exposure bake for 2 min at 95 °C.\nDevelop wafers in SU-8 developer for 1 min, or until photoresist residue is removed. Rinse wafer with isopropanol, moving from top to bottom. Dry wafer with nitrogen, again moving from top to bottom. Bake wafers at 180 °C for 4 min.\nSpin-coat patterned wafers again with 2:1 SU-8 dilution at 2,000 rpm for 45 sec.\nSoft bake patterned wafers for 2 min at 95 °C. Using contact aligner, align patterned wafers with reaction chamber pattern, and expose for 10 sec. Perform post-exposure bake for 2 min at 95 °C.",
    "Develop wafers as described in step 1.4.3. After developing and drying wafers, bake wafers at 180 °C for 4 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The wafers may be developed in the same developer that was used in the previous step.\nPrepare the Control Valve Master\n\t\nSpin-coat undiluted SU-8 photoresist onto clean wafers at 2,000 rpm for 45 sec.\nSoft bake wafer at 95 °C for 6 min. Using a contact aligner, expose wafers with control valve pattern for 10 sec. Perform a post-exposure bake at 95 °C for 6 min.\nDevelop wafers in SU-8 Developer for 2 min, or until residue is removed. Rinse with isopropanol, moving from top to bottom. Dry wafer with nitrogen and bake at 180 °C for 4 min.\n2. PDMS Device Fabrication\nSilanize all masters with ~0.2 ml trimethylchlorosilane via vapor deposition.\n\t\nQuickly enclose the master in an airtight container at RT with a few drops of the silanizing agent.\n\t\tNOTE: Other silanizing protocols may be acceptable.38 If performed properly, the PDMS will be easy to remove.\nMix a commercial poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) base and curing agent in different ratios for both the membrane and control valve layers of the device, as has been demonstrated in similar multilayer valve designs39. Use 20:1 and 5:1 ratios of base:curing agent for the membrane and control valve molds, respectively.\n\t\nFor the membrane mold, mix 10 g of base with 0.5 g of curing agent.\n\t\tNOTE: This volume will be spin-coated onto the membrane master.\nFor the control valve mold, mix the base and curing agent in a 5:1 ratio. The amount of PDMS necessary to mold the control valve will depend on the container used to hold the control valve master; fill the container such that the master is coated with ~1 cm of PDMS.",
    "Thoroughly mix both PDMS preparations, and de-gas them in a vacuum chamber until no air bubbles are visible. Place the control valve master in a heat-resistant container, such as a glass dish. Carefully pour 5:1 ratio PDMS over the master, and de-gas the container a second time.\nWhile the control valve PDMS container is being de-gassed, spin-coat the 20:1 ratio PDMS on the membrane master by carefully pouring the PDMS mixture onto the membrane master to minimize air bubble formation, then spin-coating the master at 1,000 rpm for 45 sec.\nPartially cure both masters in an oven at 80 °C for 6 min for the membrane master and 15 min for the control valve master.\n\tNOTE: When partially cured, the PDMS should hold its form, but the material will be slightly tacky. If PDMS is not yet cured, bake again in increments of a few minutes at a time until the material holds its form when pressed.\nCut rectangular PDMS molds from control valve master, peeling the molds away gently. Punch inlet holes through the molded component using a 0.75 mm hole punch.\n\tNOTE: The hole may be cleaned by inserting a 23 gauge blunt tip needle, and the mold exterior may be cleaned with cellophane tape, if necessary.\nUsing an optical microscope to locate the reaction chambers on the membrane master, align the control valve mold component with the features of the reaction chamber membrane and place the control valve component directly on top of the membrane master. Orient the control valve inlet to the bottom left corner of the device, and ensure that the reaction chambers and channel of the membrane master are visible inside the rectangular control valve.\nBake the aligned mold components at 80 °C for 2 hr.",
    "NOTE: The membrane and control valve molds will now be sealed together, and manipulated as one mold.\nCut the layered PDMS mold away from the membrane master, peeling the mold away from the master very gently so as not to perforate the membrane.\nPunch inlet and outlet holes for the cell extract input using a 0.75 mm hole punch. Punch holes through both layers, and clean them in the same way as described in step 2.6.\nUsing an inductively-coupled plasma cleaner, plasma treat both the mold (membrane side up) and a No. 0 glass coverslip at 10.5 W for 20 sec. Immediately remove the coverslip and mold from the plasma cleaner and layer the components, membrane side towards the glass, attempting to minimize air pockets between the glass and the mold. Do not press directly on the membrane input channel, or the membrane may anneal to the glass, making it difficult to fill the channel with reactants.\n\t\nTake special care when handling the assembled devices to avoid breaking the glass layer. Use thin glass coverslips as the device must be imaged through the glass coverslip using high magnification oil-immersion objectives — if the glass is too thick, the device features may not be visible.\nFinally, cure the completed devices at 80 °C for 2 hr.\n3. Experimental Setup for Cell-free Protein Synthesis Reaction\nHydrate a device by boiling it in deionized water for 1 hr.\n\tNOTE: Device should have a cloudy appearance when completely hydrated. Device may also be left O/N in sterile water at RT in order to hydrate it.\nUsing an inverted microscope with an incubation chamber, set the ambient temperature to 30 °C.\n\tNOTE: This temperature was chosen to optimize expression of GFP with a T7 promoter, so optimal temperatures for other reactions may vary40.",
    "Mount device to microscope stage holder with cellophane tape and wrap edges of device with wet tissue paper in order to maintain local hydration.\nUse two high precision closed-loop voltage-pressure transducers to modulate nitrogen gas pressure for control valve actuation and reagent input.\n\tNOTE: This protocol has only been tested with low-purity nitrogen, though other inert gases may be used.\n\t\nConnect the first transducer by 24-gauge PTFE tubing to a water reservoir held in a 4 ml glass vial with a septum lid. Connect the reservoir to the control valve inlet using a second tube terminated by a 23 gauge blunt tip needle.\n\t\tNOTE: Both tubes penetrate the reservoir septum with two sharp 23 gauge needles.\nConnect the second transducer by 24-gauge PTFE tubing connected to a male-to-male Luer-lok connector. Attach this to a Luer-lok 23 gauge needle connected by tubing with another 23 gauge blunt tip needle, which is assembled individually for each device. This needle connects to the membrane reaction channel; use it to flush water from the reaction channel and input reagents.\nUsing a cell-free protein expression system, assemble the components for the CFPS reaction on ice, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Minimize the time spent holding CFPS reagents on ice and place the reaction into the device immediately after assembly.",
    "NOTE: This device has been used with a commercial E. coli extract protein expression kit and a plasmid constitutively expressing GFP. The total reaction volume was scaled to 25 µl — it may be possible to use an even lower volume for reactants, if desired. As CFPS reagents tend to be sensitive to freeze-thaw cycles, it may be helpful to make aliquots of the reagents at the appropriate volume prior to the experiment. Other reagents may be added to the reaction mixture, but the reaction must be fully assembled before being applied to the device.\n\t\nAssemble the reaction, adding the DNA input last.\n\t\tNOTE: Once assembled in an Eppendorf tube, the CFPS reaction will begin if not held on ice. Since the time taken to apply the reagents to the device and begin the experiment may vary, it is helpful to start a timer once the reaction is assembled and mixed — this will keep the timescale between experiments consistent, and aid in troubleshooting.\nUsing the tubing and needle connector described in Step 3.4.2, withdraw the assembled reaction into the tube using a 1 ml syringe. Insert the blunt tip needle into the reaction chamber inlet. Detach the needle connector from the syringe and attach it to the male-to-male connector used for the reaction chamber transducer.\nApply pressure (<10 psi) to the CFPS reactants to fill the channel. Remove the needle when the reaction is filled.\nInsert the blunt tube from the other transducer into the control valve inlet. Do not pressurize the control valve yet.\nPlace the mounted device on the stage. Using brightfield imaging, locate the reaction chambers with a 100X oil-immersion objective.",
    "Actuate the control valve by pressurizing the control valve transducer to 20 psi; a visible change in the membrane will be evident when the control valve is actuated. Focus on the bottoms of the reaction chambers.\nBegin the image acquisition; growth in fluorescence will be visible in the interior and around the exterior of the reaction chambers, though it will likely not be evident in the early stages of the reaction. Capture images every 1-3 min until the reaction reaches a steady state fluorescence. If an automatically focusing stage is not available, briefly refocus each image prior to the images being taken.\n\tNOTE: While some photobleaching will occur, the effects on relative fluorescence due to photobleaching may be accounted for as long as the rate of photobleaching is known. This photobleaching rate may be estimated by exposing a fluorescent standard, such as a known concentration of GFP or a fluorophore mixture, to constant photobleaching over a period of time.\nRecord the time elapsed from the reaction assembly to the first image acquired.\n\tNOTE: This typically takes 4-5 min.\n4. Image Analysis and Data Processing\nUsing an image analysis software such as ImageJ, select the interior of the reaction chambers as an ROI. Acquire the mean fluorescence intensity value of the ROI for all images.\n\tNOTE: This is the raw fluorescence intensity trace.\n\t\nPerform this task in ImageJ using the Time Series Analyzer and ROI Manager plugins — Use Time Series Analyzer to choose regions of interest around the interior of each reaction chamber. Set “AutoROIProperties” to an area which corresponds to the interior of each reaction chamber, check “Add On Click”, and select each chamber.",
    "NOTE: This step may also be done using the ellipse tool to draw an ROI around the fluorescent chamber. This ROI size usually corresponds to a 30 x 30 pixel ellipse for a 10 µm diameter chamber viewed with a 100X objective.\nHighlight all ROIs in the ROI Manager. Use the “Multi Measure” function to determine the fluorescence intensity mean of each ROI through the entire image stack.\n\t\tNOTE: A plugin named StackReg may be used to align the image stack, if necessary.\nAfter acquiring the raw fluorescence intensity traces for all chambers in an experiment, determine the deterministic component of the reaction by taking an inter-experimental average across all traces, and subtracting the average from individual raw traces. Use data analysis software such as IGOR or MS Excel for this analysis.\n\tNOTE: This provides noise traces for each reaction chamber.\nAnalyze the gene expression noise from these reaction chambers using the same methods used to analyze gene expression noise derived from cells25."
