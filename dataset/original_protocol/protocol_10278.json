    "All animal experiments were performed according to the approved regulations and guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (Animal Protocol Number ARF-SBS/NIE-A0263).\n1. AR-OR-PAM System (Figure 1)\nSystem configuration: AR-PAM\nUse a nanosecond tunable laser system consisting of a diode-pumped, solid-state Nd-YAG laser (532 nm) and a dye laser with a tunability range of 559-576 nm as the optical irradiation source. Set the laser wavelength to 570 nm using an external controller and the repetition rate of the laser to 1 kHz using the laser software.\nPlace a beam sampler at a 45° angle in front of the laser to divert 5% of the laser power to a photodiode through a variable neutral density filter (NDF1; OD = 0-4.0).\nDivert the laser beam after the beam sampler at 90° using a right-angle prism (RAP1).\nUse another right-angle prism (RAP2) to allow the beam to pass through a variable neutral density filter (NDF2; OD = 0-4.0) and onto a multimode fiber (MMF), directing it through a fiber coupler (FC)-a combination of objectives (numerical aperture (NA): 0.25) and an XY translator.\nFix the fiber onto the scanning stage using an XY translator. Place a plano-convex lens (L1) 25 mm away from the fiber output end to collimate the beam out of the fiber.\nPass the collimated beam through a conical lens with an apex angle of 130° to generate a ring-shaped beam. Weakly focus the ring-shaped beam onto the subject using a homemade optical condenser (OC) with cone angles of 70° and 110° and with a hole in the center.\nPlace a 50 MHz ultrasonic transducer (UST) with an acoustic lens (AL) at the center of the homemade condenser.\nSystem configuration: OR-PAM",
    "Use a nanosecond tunable laser system consisting of a diode-pumped, solid-state Nd-YAG laser (532 nm) and a dye laser with a tunability range of 559 - 576 nm as the optical irradiation source. Set the laser wavelength at 570 nm using an external controller and the repetition rate of the laser at 5 kHz using the laser software.\nRotate the computer-controlled rotational stage (holding the RAP1) by 90° to divert the laser beam onto an iris for reshaping.\nAttenuate the laser beam placing a variable neutral density filter (OD: 0-4.0) along the beam and then focus the beam with a condenser lens (CL). Pass it through a pinhole (PH) 75 mm away from the CL for spatial filtering.\nLaunch the spatially filtered beam onto a single-mode fiber (SMF) using a single-mode fiber coupler (FC) consisting of a 0.1 NA objective to focus the light beam on to the SMF.\nAdjust the fiber coupler to achieve maximum coupling efficiency.\nFix the fiber out onto the scanning stage using a slip plate (SP). Place an achromatic lens (L2) 50 mm away from the SM fiber to collimate the laser beam.\nDivert the collimated beam by 90° using a kinematic controllable elliptical mirror (M) to fill the back aperture of another identical achromatic lens (L3). Place the achromatic lens used for focusing on a translation mount (TM2) using a lens tube (LT).\nPass the focusing beam through a homemade optoacoustic beam combiner consisting of a right-angled prism (RA) and a rhomboid prism (RP), with a layer of silicon oil (SO) in between.\n\t\tNOTE: The silicon oil layer will act as optically transparent and acoustically reflective film.\nAttach an acoustic lens (AL) to provide acoustic focusing (focal diameter: ~46 µm) at the bottom of the rhomboid prism.",
    "Place the ultrasonic transducer with a 50 MHz center frequency on top of the rhomboid prism; use an epoxy layer for effective coupling.\n2. System Switching and Alignment\nFix (by screwing tightly) the homemade switchable plate to a 3-axis motorized stage controlled by a 3-axis controller connected to the computer.\nAttach the AR and OR cage system to the homemade plate using cage mounting brackets to allow for easy switching between the AR and OR scan heads. Slide the scan head on top of the imaging area.\nUse the Z-stage to submerge the bottom part of the AR-OR-PAM scanner head in a water-filled acrylic tank (13 cm x 30 cm x 3 cm) for acoustic coupling.\nOpen an imaging window with a 7-cm diameter on the bottom plate of the tank and seal it with a polyethylene membrane for optical and acoustic transmission.\nUse a pulse-echo amplifier and an oscilloscope to align the ultrasound transducer in focus.\nSet the gain in pulse echo amplifier to 24 db in the transmission/receiving mode.\nUse the sync-out signal from the pulse-echo amplifier as the trigger and detect the backscattered signal from a glass slide (inserted from the bottom of water tank) using an oscilloscope.\n\t\tNOTE: The slide should have black tape stuck to it.\nMove the Z-axis to maximize the amplitude of the pulse-echo signal (viewed on the oscilloscope).\n\t\tNOTE: When the glass plate is in focus, the echo will have its maximum amplitude.\nSwitch on the laser and connect the UST to two amplifiers, each with 24 dB fixed gain, using BNC cables.\n\tNOTE: The outputs of the amplifiers are connected to the data acquisition card (DAQ).\nUse the signal from the photodiode (PD) placed in front of the laser as a trigger for the data acquisition system.",
    "In AR-PAM, vary the distance between the conical lens (con.L) and the optical condenser (OC) to maximize the amplitude of the photoacoustic signal generated from the test object (black tape stuck on a glass slide). Ensure that the optical and acoustic focuses are confocal by determining the maximum photoacoustic (PA) signal amplitude.\nNote the delay of the maximum PA signals; use this later to check the focus in the data acquisition software.\nLoosen the screw of scanning head and manually switch the scanning head from AR-PAM to OR-PAM. Then, tighten the screws.\nIn OR-PAM, vary the distance between the focusing achromatic doublet (inside the lens tube (LT)) and the optoacoustic combiner to maximize the PA signal amplitude shown on the oscilloscope.\nNote the delay of the maximum PA signals.\n\t\tNOTE: Finetuning is necessary to determine the confocal arrangement.\n3. Experimental Steps\nLateral resolution and imaging depth quantification\nUse gold nanoparticles 100 nm in diameter to determine the lateral resolution of the AR and OR system.\nDilute 0.1 mL of nanoparticle solution with an equal amount of water. Distribute 0.1 mL of diluted solution on a cover slip and place it in contact with the polyethylene membrane under the tank.\nMake sure that the AR-PAM and OR-PAM is in focus in the data acquisition software (see the Table of Materials) before scanning (steps 2.8 and 2.10).\n\t\tNOTE: By knowing the microsecond delay of the maximum PA signals from steps 2.9 and 2.10, multiplied by the sampling rate (250 MS/s), the image will be in focus in the data acquisition software. The delay which that must be omitted during data acquisition can be determined in the software so as to save only the necessary data points for post-processing.",
    "Set the scan parameters for the AR-PAM and press the \"scan\" button to start raster scanning.\n\t\t\nSet the scan parameters for the AR-PAM in the data acquisition software at \"4\" mm/s scanning speed in the \"velocity\" tab, \"1\" kHz in the \"pulse repetition rate\" tab, \"0.5\" mm in the \"Y-scan range\" tab, and \"0.5\" mm in the \"X-scan range\" tab. Set the step size in the x-direction at \"4\" µm in the \"dx\" tab.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The step size in the y-direction is automatically determined from the scan speed velocity of the stage and the pulse repetition rate (in this case, 4,000 µm/1,000 Hz = 4 µm)\nSet the scan parameters for the OR-PAM and press the \"scan\" button to start raster scanning.\n\t\t\nSet the scan parameters in the data acquisition software at \"2.5\" mm/s scanning speed in the \"velocity\" tab, \"5\" kHz in the \"pulse repetition rate\" tab, \"0.5\" mm in the \"Y-scan range\" tab, and \"0.5\" mm in the \"X-scan range\" tab. Set the step size in the x-direction a \"0.5\" µm in the \"dx\" tab.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The step size in the y-direction is automatically determined from the scan speed velocity of the stage and the pulse repetition rate (in this case, 2,500 µm/5,000 Hz = 0.5 µm).\nEnsure that during the scanning process, the data is continuously captured and stored on the computer\n\t\tNOTE: Data will be captured only in one direction of motion of the Y-stage.\nUse the multiple B-scan data stored in the computer to retrieve the maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images using image processing software (see the Table of Materials).",
    "Use a single nanoparticle image (out of multiple images) from the scan to determine the lateral resolution by manually plotting a line through the central region of the nanoparticle image to obtain a point-spread function, which looks like Gaussian curve. See Figure 2.\nFit the point-spread function obtained from a single nanoparticle image using a Gaussian fit function and measure the full width at half maximum (FWHM) using image processing software (see the Table of Materials). Use this as the lateral resolution. See Figure 2.\nInsert a piece of black tape obliquely onto a piece of sliced chicken tissue as the target object for depth imaging. Place the tissue with the tape in the water tank.\n\t\tNOTE: The black tape is stuck to a metal plate with a sharp tip, which helps to attach the tape to the tissue.\nSet the scan parameters for the AR-PAM into the data acquisition software and then press the \"scan\" button to capture a single B-scan image to determine the maximum imaging depth.\n\t\t\nSet the scan parameters at \"15\" mm/s scanning speed in the \"velocity\" tab, \"1\" kHz in the \"pulse repetition rate\" tab, \"5\" cm in the \"Y-scan range\" tab, and \"0.1\" mm in the \"X-scan range\" tab.

Set the step size in the x-direction at \"0.1\" mm in the \"dx\" tab.",
    "NOTE: Since the X-scan range and dx are the same, only one B-scan will be captured. The time-resolved PA signals multiplied by the speed of sound in soft tissue (1,540 m/s) will give an A-line image. Multiple A-lines are captured during the continuous motion of the Y-stage to produce a B-scan.\nIn vivo imaging of the mouse ear blood vasculature\nUse a female mouse with a bodyweight of 25 g and an age of 4 weeks.\nAnesthetize the animal using a cocktail of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (16 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally (dosage of 0.1 mL/10 g).\nRemove the hair from the animal ear using hair removal cream. Wipe the area clean. Cover the eye of the animal with a sterile ocular ointment to avoid any scattered laser beam falling onto the eyes.\nPosition the animal on a stage that also has a miniature plate to position the ear.\nMaintain anesthesia with inhaled isoflurane (0.75% in 1 L/min oxygen) during the imaging period.\nClamp a pulse oximeter to the mouse leg or tail and monitor the physiological status. Allow the imaging region to be in contact with the polyethylene membrane using ultrasound gel.\nSet the scan parameters for the AR-PAM and press the \"scan\" button to start raster scanning.\n\t\t\nSet the scan parameters for the AR-PAM in the data acquisition software at \"15\" mm/s scanning speed in the \"velocity\" tab, \"1\" kHz in the \"pulse repetition rate\" tab, \"10 mm\" in the \"Y-scan range\" tab, and \"6\" mm in the \"X-scan range\" tab. Set the step size in the x-direction as \"30\" µm in the \"dx\" tab.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The step size in the y-direction is automatically determined from the scan speed velocity of the stage and the pulse repetition rate (in this case, 15,000 µm/1,000 Hz = 15 µm).",
