    "The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Management Committee from Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Record No. 2021-11). Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (260-300 g, 8-10 weeks old) were used for the present study. The rats were kept in an animal chamber and were free to drink and eat during the experiment.\n1. Solution preparation\nPrepare physiological salt solution (PSS) by dissolving 118 mM of NaCl, 4.7 mM of K+, 2.5 mM of CaCl2, 1.2 mM of KH2PO4, 1.2 mM of MgCl2∙6H2O, 25 mM of NaHCO3, 11 mM of D-glucose, and 5 mM of HEPES (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare high K+ salt solution by dissolving 58 mM of NaCl, 60 mM of K+, 2.5 mM of CaCl2, 1.2 mM of KH2PO4, 1.2 mM of MgCl2∙6H2O, 25 mM of NaHCO3, 11 mM of D-glucose, and 5 mM of HEPES.\nSaturate the above two solutions and bubble with a mixed gas of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Meanwhile, maintain the pH values of the solution between 7.38 and 7.42 with 2 mM NaOH.\n\tNOTE: For details information on solution preparation, please see reference15.\n2. Rat coronary artery dissection\nAnesthetize the rat by inhalation of 2% isoflurane. Confirm deep anesthesia by toe pinch and, if needed, administer additional anesthetics. Then immediately open the thoracic cavity to expose the heart on the portable operating table following a previously published report12.\nAfter dissociating and removing the heart, drain the residual blood from all the heart chambers by mildly squeezing with medical plastic forceps. Quickly place the pre-processed heart in a Petri dish containing 95% O2 + 5% CO2 saturated PSS at 4 °C, having a pH value of 7.40.",
    "To accurately identify the anatomical position of the coronary arteries, adjust the posture of the isolated heart under the light microscope according to the schematic diagram (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: On the frontal view, the right auricle and the pulmonary artery were on the upper left and the upper right, respectively.\n\t\nCut the left and right ventricular cavities along the interventricular septum from the root of the pulmonary artery with surgical scissors and tweezers (Figure 2B).\nTo dissociate the left and right coronary arteries from the myocardial tissue, dissect the right ventricle under an optical anatomic microscope to thoroughly expose the right coronary artery branch. Then identify the position of the left coronary artery by rotating the heart tissue 45° clockwise (Figure 2D).\nAfter removing the surrounding sticky myocardial tissue, explicitly discern the pulsing left (about 5 mm) and right (about 5 mm) coronary arteries. Separate the coronary arteries in the middle immediately and completely immerse in PSS at 4 °C. Acquire an arterial ring of about 2 mm by vertically cutting the detached artery with anatomical scissors to record the vascular tension under different stimuli (Figure 2E).\n3. Suspension and fixation of arterial ring\nNOTE: For details on this step, please see reference14.\nPrepare two 2 cm stainless steel wires (see Table of Materials) and pre-soak in 4 °C PSS solution saturated with 95% O2 + 5% CO2. Pass both the wires parallelly through the arterial ring along with the vessel's direction under an optical anatomical microscope and with wires of equal length exposed at both ends of the vascular cavity.",
    "Fix the arterial ring with the steel wire front and back in the bath of the wire micrograph filled with bubbling PSS with 95% O2 + 5% CO2. Rotate the horizontal screw knob for an appropriate front and rear spacing so that the two wires are horizontal and the arterial ring is in a natural state of relaxation.\nAfter installing the DMT bath on the thermostatic apparatus, open the data acquisition software (see Table of Materials) to ensure that the corresponding path signal was recorded. Set the following parameters: eyepiece calibration (mm/div): 0.36; target pressure (kPa): 13.3; IC1/IC100: 0.9; online averaging time: 2 s; delay time: 60 s. The steps of arterial ring fixation are shown in Figure 3.\n4. Standardization of vascular tension in rat arterial ring\nNOTE: For different cavity samples, optimal initial tension was necessary for vessels to maintain exceptional activity in vitro. For details, please see reference15.\nAchieve the optimal initial tension of the arterial ring by applying a reasonable tension along the diameter of the vessel.\n\tNOTE: Based on the previous study16, the maximal agonist-induced tension was accomplished at the factor k value of 0.90 with the initial stretch tension of 1.16 ± 0.04 mN/mm (reference values for different vessel samples: k value, 0.90-0.95; initial tension, 1.16-1.52 mN/mm).\nAt this point, set the displayed vascular tension value to zero. Afterward, apply a 3 mN pull stimulus to the arterial ring by rotating the spiral axis of the bath.\nAfter incubation for 1 h in oxygen-saturated PSS buffer at 37 °C, pH 7.40, set the tension value to 0 mN again on the tension control panel of the wire micrograph. The setting process of the initial tension of the arterial ring is shown in Figure 4.\n5. Reactivity detection of coronary artery ring",
    "Perform the contractile activity of the coronary artery ring with the wire myograph technique14, and validate in three separate operations by stimulating with 60 mM of K+ solution for 10 min each.\nAfter each stimulation, flush the bath with oxygen-saturated PSS until vascular tone returns to its initial state.\n\tNOTE: Only when the tension fluctuation of the three parallel measurements was less than 10%, and the amplitude of each contraction was greater than 1 mN/mm, qualified and highly active arterial rings could be used for further experiments. The activity verification of the rat coronary ring is shown in Figure 5.\n6. Post-surgical treatment\nAfter surgery, euthanize the animals following institutionally approved protocols.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, the animals were euthanized by inhaling excess isoflurane.\nSubscription Required.
