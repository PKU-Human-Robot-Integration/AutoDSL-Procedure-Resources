    "NOTE: Method 1 (generation of HAP1-BE3 cell lines) is optional. Instead of constructing a BE3-expressing cell line, BE3-encoding plasmid DNA can be co-transfected with gRNA-encoding plasmid DNA. Other variants of cytosine base editors, such as BE4max, also can be used for highly efficient base editing.\n1. Generation of HAP1-BE3 cell lines\nConstruction of plasmid DNA\n\t\nTo construct the lentiBE3-blast plasmid DNA for lentivirus production, amplify the BE3 coding sequences in pCMV-BE3 (Table of Materials) by PCR using high-fidelity polymerase. Design the PCR primer to contain overlapping sequences of the digested vector (from step 1.1.2) for isothermal assembly as follows17:\n\t\tprimer-F: 5’-TTTGCCGCCAGAACACAGGACCGGTTCTAGA GCCGCCACCATGAGCTCAGAG-3’,\n\t\tprimer-R: 5’-CAGAGAGAAGTTTGTTGCGCCGGATCC GACTTTCCTCTTCTTCTTGGG-3’\n\t\tNOTE: Nucleotides shown in underlined are overlapped with the digested vector and these sequences will be specific to the destination vector chosen by the user.\nDigest lentiCas9-blast (Table of Materials) plasmid DNA with the restriction enzymes, XbaI and BamHI (1 unit per 1 μg) for 1 h at 37 °C. Run the digested product on a 0.8% agarose gel and purify the appropriate-sized bands (8.6 kb) using a commercial gel extraction kit (Table of Materials).\nClone the amplified BE3 PCR product and digested lentiCas9-Blast vector using the isothermal assembly kit (Table of Materials). Use a total of 0.02-0.5 pmol of DNA fragments and a 1:3 ratio of vector:insert. Transform the assembly product into DH5 alpha-competent cells18. Add the transformants on an agar plate containing ampicillin (100 µg/mL) and incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C.\nPick several colonies and inoculate them in 4 mL of LB (lysogeny broth) medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and grow the culture in a shaking incubator at 180 rpm.\nPurify plasmid DNA using a commercial plasmid DNA purification kit (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.",
    "To confirm DNA cloning success, analyze the BE3 sequences of each purified plasmid DNA (from step 1.1.5) by Sanger sequencing using standard and BE3-specific primers (Supplementary Table 1) and select the exact cloned lentiBE3-blast construct.\n\t\tNOTE: To analyze the results of Sanger sequencing, we recommended several tools such as BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and CLUSTALW (https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw).\nCell culture and generation of HAP1-BE3 cell lines\n\t\nMaintain cells in a healthy condition and in an actively dividing state. Culture HAP1 cells in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (Table of Materials) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Culture HEK293T/17 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Table of Materials) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\n\t\tNOTE: HAP1 cell is useful for genetic research because of it is nearly haploid cells. However, the cells can spontaneously return to a diploid state in cell culture. Enrichment Hoechst 34580 stained 1n-population using flowcytometry will be helpful for maintenance of haploidy of HAP1 cells19.\nSeed 5 x 106 HEK293T/17 cells on a 100 nm dish 1 day before transfection. On the day of transfection, transfect the plasmid DNA (15 µg of lentiBE3-blast, 9 µg of psPAX2 for viral packaging, and 6 µg of pMD2.G for vial envelope of 2nd generation lentiviral packaging system) using commercial transfection reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Table of Materials)20. Change the medium at 6 h post-transfection and harvest virus-containing medium at 48 h or 72 h post-transfection. Filter the supernatant using a 0.45 µm filter.\nTransduce the lentiviral particles of BE3 into HAP1 cells at a MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 0.1. To adjust for an appropriate MOI, use serially diluted concentrations of virus. Remove the medium and replace it with adjusted viral supernatant and fresh culture medium.",
    "One day after transduction, change the medium to 10 µg/mL of blasticidin (Table of Materials)-containing medium and select the transduced cells for 3 days with blasticidin. After blasticidin selection, select a well with ~10% of surviving cells for the next step.\nAfter blasticidin selection, seed the transduced cells on 96-well plates at a density of 0.5 cells/well in order to isolate single clones (e.g., dilute 50 cells in 20 mL (0.5 cells per 200 µL) culture medium and aliquot 200 µL per well in 96 well plate). Incubate the 96-well plates for 2 weeks and pick the single colonies to confirm the BE3 activity.\nDivide the single colonies into two sets, one sets for testing BE3 activity and other for maintenance. Transduce the lentiviral particles of gRNAs into one of the sets to confirm the BE3 activity. Analyze the mutation frequency of each colony using T7 endonuclease I (T7E1, Table of Materials) assay or by performing the targeted deep sequencing technique (step 4)21. Select appropriate single clones that are healthy and have a highly active BE3.\n\t\tNOTE: To validate exact mutation frequencies, we recommend the targeted deep sequencing than T7E1 assay. HEK2 (5’-GAACACAAAGCATAGACTGCGGG-‘3) is well validated target site for BE3.\n2. Design and construction of BRCA1 targeting gRNAs\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61557/61557fig02.jpg",
    "Figure 2: An example of a gRNA plasmid DNA. (A) To effectively edit the target sequence with BE3, an NGG PAM (CCN PAM) that places the target C (target G) within a five-nucleotide window is required. NGG PAM is shown in red and the base editing window is represented by a gray box. (B) The gRNA sequence for c.8047C>T (H1283Y) base editing is indicated and the target C:G pairs are shown in red while the active window is highlighted by a gray box. For gRNA cloning, the overhang sequences indicated in bold are added at both the 5ʹ ends. Templates for gRNA were generated by annealing the two complementary oligonucleotides.

In this study, c.5252G>A (R1751Q) and c.4527C>T (Y1509Y) are used as benign controls. c.191G>A (C64Y), 81-1G>A, and c.3598C>T (Q1200*) are used as pathogenic controls. Target sequences of each gRNA are listed in Supplementary Table 1.\nObtain the BRCA1 genome sequence from GenBank at NCBI22.\nSearch the 20-bp target sites with the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence “NGG” and “CCN” around mutation of interest. The mutation of interest should be located in 4–8 nucleotides in the PAM-distal end of the gRNA target sequences because of the active window of BE3 is 4–8 nucleotides in the PAM-distal end of the gRNA target sequences14. In the case of c.8047C>T (H1283Y)- and c.5252G>A (R1751Q)-targeting gRNAs, 5ʹ-TCAGGAACATCACCTTAGTG-AGG-3ʹ and 5ʹ-CCA-CCAAGGTCCAAAGCGAGCAA-3ʹ, the sequences in bold are active windows. C to T and G to A conversions occur with NGG and CCN PAM, respectively (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: BE-Designer (http://www.rgenome.net/be-designer/)23 is useful web-based tools for gRNA design.",
    "Order two complementary oligonucleotides per gRNA; for the forward oligonucleotides, add “CACCG” to the 5ʹ end of the guide sequence, and for the reverse oligonucleotides, add “AAAC” to the 5’ end and “C” to the 3’ end. These additional sequences are specific to the destination gRNA expression vector (from step 2.5) used for this protocol, and users should be adjusted for alternative gRNA expression vectors (Figure 2B).\nResuspend the oligonucleotide in distilled water at a final concentration of 100 µM. Mix the two complementary oligonucleotides to a final concentration of 10 µM with T4 Ligation buffer (Table of Materials) and heat them at 95 °C for 5 min and cool them at room temperature for annealing.\nDigest pRG2 using the restriction enzyme, BsaI (1 unit per 1 μg) for 1 h at 37 °C (Table of Materials). Run the digested product on 1% agarose gel and purify the appropriate-sized band (2.5 kb).\n\tNOTE: Instead of using a classic digestion and ligation method, other cloning method such as Golden Gate cloning can be used.\nLigate the annealed oligonucleotide duplex to the vector DNA using the purchased DNA ligase (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and transform them into DH5 alpha-competent cells (Other E. coli strains which widely used for subcloning also can be used).\nAdd the transformants to an agar plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C. Purify plasmid DNA from several transformants and analyze their gRNA sequences by Sanger sequencing using primers which prime at U6 promoter (Table of Materials).\n3. Creation of BRCA1 variants using CRISPR-mediated base editing tools",
    "NOTE: If HAP1-BE3 cell lines is not used, BE3-encoding plasmid DNA can be co-transfected with BRCA1-targeting gRNA. Compared to co-transfection of BE3 and gRNA plasmids, transfection of gRNA plasmid to HAP-BE3 cells induce efficient base editing up to 3-fold at target locus in our hands.\nSeed 5 x 105 HAP1-BE3 cells (or HAP1 cells in case of co-transfection methods) per well in 24-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. At the time of transfection, culture cells to reach an appropriate density (70%–80% confluence).\nTransfect BRCA1-targeting gRNAs using the purchased transfection reagents (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Use 1 µg of BRCA1-targeting gRNAs (with 1 µg of BE3-encoding plasmid DNA in case of co-transfection methods) to induce C:G to T:A conversion at BRCA1 target sites. Incubate the cells at 37 °C and subculture every 3–4 days.\nHarvest the cell pellets 3, 10, and 24 days after transfection to analyze base editing efficiencies (Samples from 3 days after transfection are analyzed regrading as day 0 samples).\nExtract genomic DNA using the genomic DNA purification kit (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: We recommend optimizing transfection conditions with variable ratio of reagent to DNA. Optimal condition for HAP1 transfection is 4:1 ration of reagent to DNA in our hands.\n4. Sample preparation for Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61557/61557fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Preparation for next-generation sequencing. The 1st PCR primer was designed to amplify the BRCA1 target site on genomic DNA. The 2nd PCR primer was designed such that its sequences are located more inside than the 1st PCR primer sequences. Additional sequences shown as a yellow bar were added at both ends of the 2nd PCR primer to attach the essential sequences for performing next-generation sequencing. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61557/61557fig03large.jpg]",
    "Design the 1st PCR primers to amplify BRCA1 target sites. Although there is no restriction on the size of the 1st PCR product, a product size of <1 kb is recommended to efficiently amplify a specific region (Figure 3).\nDesign the 2nd PCR primers located inside the 1st PCR product. Consider the size of the amplicon according to the NGS read length (For example, the size of the amplicon product should be smaller than 300 bp for 2 × 150 bp paired-end run to merge each reads). In order to attach essential sequences for NGS analysis, add additional sequences to the 5’ end of the 2nd PCR primers as follows: for the forward primers, add 5’-ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3’ sequences to the 5’ end, and for the reverse primers, add 5’-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCG ATCT-3’ sequences to the 5’ end.\n\tNOTE: We used nested PCR to reduce the amplicon of non-specific binding by preventing primers from attaching to non-target sequence.\nAmplify the BRCA1 target sites on the genomic DNA obtained from three time points. Use high-fidelity polymerase according to the manufacturer’s protocol for minimizing PCR errors. For the 1st PCR reaction, use 100 ng of genomic DNA for amplification over 15 cycles. For the 2nd PCR reaction, use 1 µL of the 1st PCR product for amplification over 20 cycles. Run 5 µL of the 2nd PCR product on 2% agarose gel and confirm the size.\nIn order to attach the essential sequences for NGS analysis, amplify the 2nd PCR product using the primers listed below. For the PCR reaction, 1 µL of the 2nd PCR product is used for amplification up to 30 cycles using high-fidelity polymerase.",
    "To perform multiplex sequencing for large numbers of libraries to be pooled and sequenced simultaneously, use forward (D501 – D508) and reverse (D701 – D712) primers, which have unique index sequence (Supplementary Table 1). Amplify each sample using different primers sets to conduct the unique dual indexing strategy.\nRun 5 µL of the PCR product on 2% agarose gel to confirm the size, and purify the amplicon using a commercial PCR clean-up kit (Table of Materials). Mix each sample in equal amounts to create an NGS library.\nQuantify the NGS library at 260 nm wavelength using spectrophotometers and dilute the NGS library to concentration of 1 nM using resuspension buffer or 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Prepare 100 µL of the library diluted to the appropriate loading concentration depending on the library types (For example, prepare 200 pM of the library for Nextera DNA Flex).\n\t\nAs a control, combine phiX with the diluted sample appropriate for the type of kit.\nLoad the library onto the cartridge and run NGS according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Illumina iSeq 100 or Miseq systems can sequence the amplicons of various length up to 300 bp for single-read or paired end. We recommended over 10,000 reads per target amplicon for in-depth analysis of base editing efficiency.\n5. Analysis of base editing efficiency for the functional assessment of BRCA1 variants\nAnalyze the base editing efficiencies using MAUND24. The base editing efficiency is calculated as described below.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61557/61557equ01.jpg",
    "If multiple cytosines are present in BE3 active window, only the C to T conversion that is targeted for evaluating the BRCA1 variant is considered. For example, if the sequences of BE3 active window are “C4A5T6C7T8,” the possible sequences generated by base editing are “T4A5T6C7T8”, “C4A5T6T7T8”, and “T4A5T6T7T8”. At this time, if position 4 is the targeted position for the desired BRCA1 variant, then only the ““T4A5T6C7T8” sequence is considered for calculating base editing efficiency.\n\tNOTE: We also recommend other web-tools for analysis of base editing activity such as CRISPResso225, and BE-analyzer23.\nVerify the results using positive and negative controls of BRCA1 variants. The base editing efficiencies of the benign control should remain the same, whereas those of the pathogenic control should decrease over time.\nCalculate the relative base editing efficiency of BRCA1 variants and determine their pathogenicity. The significant differences between Day 0 and Day 21 samples are analyzed appropriate statistical analysis such as t-test.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
