    "After the specimen is properly dried, it can be packed inside the transparent plastic bag as follows:\n1. The sealed base of the plastic bag is to be sealed once more with sealer \\(Fig. 1A)\n  2. 10-20 grams of silica gel \\(blue) is to be put inside the plastic bag.\n  3. The bag is to be sealed in a way to leave open around 1 cm open towards the edge \\(Fig. 1B).\n  4. The specimen may be put inside the bag directly, or it may be may be supported by tissue paper; minute and fragile specimens may further be supported in plastic wrap/ cling wrap/ film wrap usually used for wrapping foods. The specimen thus kept would not come in direct contact with the silica crystals because there are some reports stating that adhering crystals to the specimens might cause problems at the time of microscopic mounts \\(Lodge et al. 2004).\n  5. Air may be drawn out gently and then sealed \\(Fig. 1C)\n  6. Fungarium submission data sheet concerning scientific name, family, accession code, field code, date and place of collection, of data, name of the collector etc. cut to fit the size of the plastic bag may then be inserted and finally sealed as per Fig. 1D.\n  7. The voucher specimen is ready for deposition in a fungarium.\n  8. The details of voucher specimen could be noted in a computer data sheet so that they could be easily accessed.\n  9. Then they could be arranged variously according to genus, family, collection site etc. and put inside the airtight container.\n  10. The said airtight container may harbor 2-10 such voucher specimens depending upon the size. Care is to be taken not to compress specimens too tightly together.",
    "11. The names and accession numbers of the specimens present in the box may be printed and put inside the box so that it is visible from the outside \\(Fig. 2A).\n  12. After filling up the voucher specimens, some silica gel may be put inside the box and the lid may be tightened properly \\(Fig 2B-C).\n  13. The boxes may be kept systematically in a dehumidified place for long term preservation."
