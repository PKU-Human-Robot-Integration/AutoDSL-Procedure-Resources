    "Note: For this study, lung mesenchymal stromal cells (LR-MSCs) from distal lung tissue were isolated either based on their expression of cell surface markers (CD45neg, CD31neg, Sca-1high, Epcamneg)  14,15, using explant out-growth 16, or using enzymatic digestion 17. Adherent LR-MSCs were cultured in DMEM with high glucose and no glutamine, 15% FBS, 1x antibiotic/antimycotic, and 2 mM glutamine (henceforth complete media) and incubated at 37 °C, 5%CO2. LR-MSCs were passaged 3-4 times to ensure a population of cells with relatively homogenous growth characteristics for the migration assay.\n1. Preparing a Confluent Monolayer\nTo detach MSCs from standard 100 mm culture dishes, wash cells with 10 ml of 37 °C pre-warmed PBS, aspirate the PBS and add 4 ml of trypsin (0.25%). Incubate 3-5 min in a 37 °C incubator. Aspirate the cells into a conical tube, add equal volume of complete media and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min to pellet down the cells.\n\tNote: Longer incubation in trypsin can alter the cell surface receptors and potentially affect migration.\nAspirate media and resuspend cells in fresh complete media. Count cells, excluding dead cells using trypan blue exclusion and plate 500,000 mesenchymal stromal cells in 4 ml of complete media on a 60 mm cell culture dish.\n\tNote: Depending on the source of the cells, tests may be necessary to determine the optimal number of cells needed.\nIncubate cells until plates are 90% confluent for optimal cell attachment and proliferation, usually 48-72 hr for MSCs.\n\tNote: 100% confluence is not recommended, since many anchorage-dependent cells experience contact inhibition, which may alter their migratory capacity. Plates with less than 80% confluence will result in unusable photos because the image analysis software will interpret gaps between cells as part of the perimeter of the scratch (see Figure 1D).",
    "After the cells have reached 90% confluence, damage the cells as appropriate for the application. To assess cell damage after exposure to soluble cigarette smoke extract (CSE), generate 100% CSE by drawing the smoke from 1 University of Kentucky research cigarette (3R4F) through 25 ml of complete media in a Büchner flask over 2 min 18.\nIncubate the cells for 24 hr in 4 ml 1-4% CSE diluted in complete media. After incubation, wash the cells twice with 4 ml of warm sterile PBS, before replacing with 4 ml fresh complete media.\n\tNote: Damaging cells with high concentrations of cigarette smoke extract (>5%) may substantially reduce confluence.\n2. Creating the Scratch\nIn a sterile environment, remove the lid from the 60 mm plate of damaged MSCs, and lay a straight edge (for example a sterilized plastic ruler) across the top rim of the plate. Without removing the media, use a sterile 200 µl pipet tip guided by the sterile straight-edge to make one to four parallel scratches across the plate approximately 5 mm apart and 50 mm long.\n\tNote: A straight edge minimizes the amount of rotational adjustments needed to the plate when it is on the microscope stage. It is imperative that the scratches appear completely vertical (or horizontal) on the screen. Generating multiple scratches on a 60 mm plate does not alter the microenvironment in a way that affects cell migration (data not shown), but may be a consideration for other cell types. The use of smaller wells is not recommended since the variability of cells growing close to the edge of the well becomes more pronounced and may affect uniform generation of scratches.",
    "Aspirate the media and gently wash the plates with 2 ml of pre-warmed complete media to prevent cells from adhering to the center of the scratch, and to remove cells that have been loosened by the scratching. Replace with 4 ml of fresh complete media.\nUsing a sterile permanent marker, label each scratch from 1-4 on the underside of the plate at location that will not interfere with imaging the scratches.\n\tNote: It is important that images from the same scratch are compared before and after migration, since there can be variation in scratch width.\n3. Taking Initial Images of the Scratch\nNote: If the scratch assay is performed on multiple plates, it is recommended that initial images of all the scratches on a single plate are taken before scratches are made on the next plate.\nUse an inverted phase contrast microscope with a camera to generate the images needed for analysis.\nPosition the culture plate on the microscope, and use the low power objective (10X) to locate scratch #1. If condensation on the lid of the culture plate is impeding a clear image of the cells, use a heated stage set to 37 °C.\nKeeping the scratch completely horizontal and in the center of the field of view, obtain as many images as necessary to encompass 90% of the scratch's length. Obtain images of distinct portions of the scratch with no overlap between images.\n\tNote: The refraction of light at the edges of the culture dish overexposes the images, making them impossible to analyze. Therefore, do not take images from the first and last 5% of the scratch's length.\nSave images from each scratch in a separate folder.\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.4 for scratches 2, 3, and 4.",
    "Return plates to the incubator immediately after initial imaging. Let cells migrate for 4-7 hr.\n\tNote: 7 hr is optimal when assessing MSCs damaged with CSE. Incubating cells for greater than 7 hr is not recommended because cell proliferation can act as a confounding variable for cell migration (see Optional Note 8.2 below).\n4. Analyzing Initial Scratch Images\nDownload ImageJ and install the Wound Healing Tool plugin (refer to the Table of Materials/Equipment).\nOpen the image file in ImageJ, then click \"Process\" and \"Find Edges\" to highlight the cells surrounding the scratch for the Wound Healing Tool to calculate the scratch area (Figure 2B). Next, click \"Image\", \"Adjust\", \"Color Threshold\" and in the dropdown menu labeled \"Threshold Color\" change the value to \"B&W.\"\nWithin the \"Color Threshold\" menu, adjust both brightness threshold sliders until optimal contrast between the scratch and cell front is achieved. To allow for the greatest range when trying to create contrast in the image, move the bottom slider completely to the right (completely black image), and then adjust the top slider to generate maximum contrast.\nSlowly adjust the top brightness slider from left to right until the image cleanly displays the contour of the scratch (Figure 2C). Once the edges of the scratch have been identified, click \"More Tools\" in the ImageJ toolbar, select \"MRI_Wound_Healing_Tool\" from the dropdown menu, and press the \"m\" button (that will appear in the ImageJ toolbar) to highlight the scratch area and output the computed area in a results pop-out window (Figure 2D).\nCopy and paste all numbers from the results window (Figure 2E) into an excel spreadsheet. Make sure to separate data from individual scratches.\n5. Taking Final Images of the Scratch",
    "After the cells have migrated (4-7 hr), repeat steps 3.2-3.4. Image the plates in the same order they were scratched so that cells on each plate have had equal time to migrate.\n\tNote: The cells can be imaged at multiple time points, depending on their sensitivity to both temperature and pH changes. Alternatively, live cell imaging can used to follow the cells in real time as they migrate.\n6. Analyzing Final Scratch Images\nRepeat steps 4.2-4.5 for final scratch images.\n7. Calculating the Scratch Area to Quantify Migration\nCompute the mean pre-migration area by averaging the initial area values of the respective scratches.\nCompute the total amount of migration by subtracting the final migration area for each image, calculated in step 6, from the average pre-migration area (step 7.1). Generate a list of values for each scratch representing the change in migration.\nPool the data from multiple scratches within the same test group (i.e. all plates and all scratches on cells exposed to 0% CSE). Use an Analysis of Variance test to analyze the differences between experimental groups.\nIf the cells are slow to migrate and require a longer incubation time after scratching (greater than 10-12 hr), perform a BrDU or EdU incorporation assay 19 to determine whether cells are undergoing any proliferation during the period in which the migration assay is occurring. Choose a migration assay time to avoid significant cell proliferation.\n8. Optional\nTo assess whether significant cell senescence is occurring as a result of the scratching procedure, perform a senescence-associated Beta-Galactosidase assay on a test plate at predetermined times after scratching 19.\nSubscription Required.
