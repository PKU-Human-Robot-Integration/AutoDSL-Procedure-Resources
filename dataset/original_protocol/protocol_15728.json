    "All methods, protocol and studies described here were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University of California, Davis.\n1. Obtaining a Liver Biopsy from a Holstein Dairy Cow\nNOTE: A liver biopsy should be performed by a licensed veterinarian. Liver biopsies can be performed on the dairy site where the cows are located. Lactating dairy cows can continue to be milked normally and milk does not need to be withdrawn from the food supply before or after the procedure. It is recommended that at least 4 people are needed to perform the liver biopsy on a dairy cow: a veterinarian to perform the biopsy, an animal handler to stand at the cow's hip to protect the biopsy area and veterinarian, a lab technician on the outside of the pen to transfer tools, materials and biopsy sample to and from the veterinarian and maintain the clean area, which can be in the back of a vehicle (Figure 1), and a technician to retrieve the liver sample and begin mitochondrial isolation.\nOne month prior to liver biopsies, give cows a clostridia vaccination. Create surgical packs by autoclaving surgical towels, biopsy instrument, scalpel holders and surgical equipment.\nOne day before the liver biopsy, inject the cow with Ceftiofur Hydrochloride 0.044 mL/kg bodyweight subcutaneously in the neck. Monitor cow temperature, intake and fecal scores to use as a baseline for normal function.\nCreate mitochondria isolation media (MIM) containining 220 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid free BSA, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. Approximately 30 mL per sample will be needed.",
    "Restrain cow physically utilizing a headlock with a halter as needed (Figure 2). Using the halter, tie her head to the left side of the stanchion. If necessary, a chemical restraint (Xylazine hydrochloride 100 mg/mL IV at 0.010-0.015 mg / kg bodyweight) can be used.\nThe area of the biopsy is found at the right 10 - 11th intercostal space (Figure 3). Draw a straight line from the right tuber coxae to the point of the right shoulder. The biopsy site is where this line intersects with the 10-11th intercostal space. Sterilize the area of the cow to be biopsied by shaving a 10 cm square area (Figure 4). Wash area with 10% providone scrub (Figure 5) using a circular motion. Spray area with 70% ethanol solution (Figure 6). Repeat providone and ethanol washes.\n\tNOTE: The liver is in a slightly different position in Holstein dairy cattle compared to beef cattle.\nInject 2% lidocaine HCl (10-15 mL) locally to the area to provide anesthesia of the skin and underlying muscle and connective tissue (Figure 7). Repeat providone and 70% ethanol washes.\n\tNOTE: The nerve endings are in the skin and muscle, but not internal organs, so only a local anesthestic is needed. At most, the cow should only feel some pressure and no pain during the biopsy procedure.\nMake a 1-2 cm stab-incision through the skin of the 10-11th intercostal space (Figure 8). Pass a Schackelford-Courtney bovine liver biopsy instrument through the skin and direct the biopsy instrument in a slight cranial direction while continuing through the diaphragm and into the liver (Figure 9, Figure 10). Obtain a 1 g sample of the liver and remove the instrument (Figure 11). Close the skin with suture placement (Figure 12).",
    "Place liver sample in a conical tube with enough MIM to cover sample, on ice for immediate mitochondria isolation\nCheck incision for any redness, swelling, heat, or pain within 24 hours of biopsy and inject the cow with Ceftiofur Hydrochloride 0.044 mL/kg bodyweight subcutaneously in the neck once a day for the next 3 days (Figure 13). Monitor the cow's temperature, intake and fecal scores daily for 1 week after liver biopsy. If a fever develops, continue antibiotics at the discretion of the veterinarian.\n\tNOTE: If a cow is exhibiting signs of pain, such as kicking at the incision site, recumbancy, redness, heat, or reaction to touch within 1 h after the liver biopsy, a 1 mg/kg bodyweight IV injection of flunixin meglumine can be used to alleviate pain and inflammation. A second injection can be administered if necessary.\nRemove sutures 7 days after biopsy.\n2. Isolating Mitochondria from Dairy Cow Liver\nAs soon as possible after the liver sample is removed from the cow, wash the liver sample in MIM (step 1.3) to remove red blood cells and finely mince the sample with scissors. The liver should be minced in a chilled beaker containing enough isolation media to keep the tissue moist.\nPlace the minced liver into a 30 mL glass vial with a teflon pestle of 0.16 mm clearance incubated in ice and containing MIM (1:4 w/v).\nHomogenize liver sample in teflon pestle at 500 rpm for a min with 4 strokes/min.\n\tNOTE: The liver homogenate is kept in an ice-packed beaker in MIM during the entire process, and all of the following centrifugation steps are completed at 4 °C",
    "Centrifuge homogenate at 500 x g for 10 min, discard pellet, transfer supernatant to a chilled centrifuge tube and then centrifuge the resulting supernatant at 10,000 x g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial pellet.\nResuspend and wash the pellet in 10 mL of MIM with fatty acid free BSA and centrifuge at 8100 x g for 10 min. Discard supernatant.\nResuspend and wash the pellet in 10 mL of MIM without fatty acid free BSA and centrifuge at 8100 x g for 10 min. Discard supernatant.\nSuspend the pellet in 200 µL of isolation media and place on ice until used for oxygen consumption and proton leak kinetic assays.\nDetermine protein concentration of the pellet suspension (1/100 dilution) using Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit per manufacturer's protocol with BSA as the standard. All protein is considered to be mitochondrial protein.\n3. Measuring Mitochondrial Oxygen Consumption (State 3 and State 4)\nCreate oxygen consumption media (OCM) from 120 mM KCl, 5 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes and 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4 at 30 °C with 0.3% defatted BSA. Approximately 3 mL per sample will be needed. Also prepare a solution of 8 μg/mL oligomycin in ethanol.\nIncubate OCM at 30 °C. Set up respiration chamber, pump and oxygen electrode according to manufacturer directions (oxygraph system). The oxygraph software should already be installed on the computer.\nPlace 1 mL of OCM into the respiration chamber and stir vigorously. This will help insure that the solution becomes saturated with air.\nAdd 0.35 mg protein of mitochondrial protein to the respiration chamber and maintain temperature at 30 °C.",
    "Record oxygen consumption for approximately 5 min. The oxygraph system records oxygen concentration so as respiration increases, oxygen concentration decreases. When oxygen consumption becomes constant (a decreasing straight line), record oxygen consumption (slope of line = concentration of oxygen/time). This is baseline oxygen consumption.\nAdd 1.25 µL of 4 mM rotenone solution to inhibit Complex I and then add 5 µL of 1 M succinate solution to reach a final concentration in the respiratory chamber of 5 mM succinate. This is state 4 respiration.\nAdd 1 µL of 100 mM ADP solution to reach a final concentration in the respiration chamber of 100 μM. Oxygen concentration will decrease (increased respiration) and then after approximately 5 min becomes a straight line. Record oxygen consumption (slope of line = concentration of oxygen/time). This is State 3 respiration.\nOptional: At the end of the run, add FCCP (0.2 μM total volume) to induce maximal respiration. Record respiration for about 5 min (approximately). When oxygen consumption becomes constant, record oxygen consumption. This is maximal oxygen consumption.\nCalculate Respiratory Control Ratio (RCR) using the equation State 3 oxygen consumption / State 4 oxygen consumption.\nAspirate all of the solutions out of the respiration chamber. Rinse the chamber several times with double deionized water.\n4. Measuring Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) and Proton Motive Force (PMF)\nPrepare solution of 80 ng/mL nigericin in ethanol.\n\tNOTE: These chemicals are dissolved in ethanol, and every effort should be made to limit the amount of ethanol that is added to less than 1 μL, since ethanol can uncouple the electron transport system and cause mitchondrial dysfunction.",
    "After thoroughly rinsing the chamber with double deionized water, place 1 mL of the OCM into the respiration chamber and stir vigorously with a magnetic stir bar. This will help insure that the solution becomes saturated with air. Add methyl-triphenyl-phosphonium (TPMP+) sensitive electrode to chamber setup. TPMP+ electrode should be connected to a pH meter and values are read from the pH meter.\nAdd 0.35 mg of mitochondrial protein to the respiration chamber.\nAdd 1.25 µL of 4 mM rotenone solution to inhibit Complex I. Record respiration for 2-5 min (approximately). When oxygen consumption becomes constant, record oxygen consumption.\nAdd 0.56 μL of 8 μg/mL oligomycin solution for a final concentration of 2.8 µg oligomycin /0.35 mg of mitochondrial protein to inhibit ADP utilization. Record respiration for 2-5 min (approximately). When oxygen consumption becomes constant, record oxygen consumption.\nAdd 0.112 μL 80 ng/mL nigericin solution to abolish the pH gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Record respiration for 2-5 min (approximately). When oxygen consumption becomes constant, record oxygen consumption.\n\tNOTE: Rotenone and oligomycin are used to block electron transport chain at Complex I and ATP synthase, respectively. Nigericin is added to convert transmembrane H+ gradient to a K+ gradient that can be measured with an electrode.\nPrepare a standard curve for TPMP+ by adding 5 µL of 10 mM TPMP+ solution to the mitochondrial incubation. Repeat this step four more times until a total concentration of 2.5 μM TPMP+ has been added.\nInitiate respiration by adding 5 μL of 1M succinate to the chamber.",
    "Record respiration until you have achieved a stable trace, and then titrate the system by adding malonate. Additions of malonate should be 0.5 µL, 1 µL, 1.5 µL, 3.0 µL, 6.0 µL, 9.0 µL, then 12.5 µL of 0.1 mM Malonate solution to achieve successive additions of malonate concentrations in the incubation chamber of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, and 2.5 mM.\nCollect data from the two electrodes (oxygen and TPMP+). Data acquisition software from the oxygraph system can be used to collect simultaneous measurements of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential and observe changes in oxygen consumption in real time. Figure 14 shows how the oxygraph system records oxygen consumption as the experiment progresses.\nCalculate MMP in mV based on the Nernst equation:\n\tMMP = 61.5 log ([TPMP+] added – external [TPMP+]) x TPMP+ binding correction/ (0.001 x mg of protein/mL x [TPMP+])\n\tA TPMP+ binding correction of 0.4 µL/mg of mitochondrial protein-1 is used.\n\tExample calculation based on concentrations in protocol:\n\tMMP = 61.5 x log (5 µM – 2 µM) x 0.4/ (0.001 x 0.35 mg mitochondrial protein/mL x 2 µM)\n\tMMP = 198.9 mV\nEstimate PMF by plotting a graph of MMP vs. oxygen consumption (Figure 15). PMF is reported as oxygen consumption at a membrane potential of 165 mV.\n\tNOTE: Titrating the electron transport chain with malonate (0.1 to 2.5 mM) shows the kinetic response of proton leak to MMP. Then, plotting MMP against oxygen consumption determines proton leak kinetics. PMF is determined by calculating oxygen consumption at a common membrane potential (165 mV).\nAt the end of the last run of the sample, add FCCP (0.2 μM total volume) to induce maximal respiration and release TPMP+ for baseline correction.",
    "Aspirate all of the solutions out of the respiration chamber. Rinse the chamber several times with double deionized water. At the end of the day, the chamber should also be rinsed a few times with ethanol.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
