This ensures that all replicate evolving lineages start from a common ancestral genotype. If mutation mapping using genome sequencing is planned, it is also desirable to sequence this ancestral population so as to filter out pre-existing mutations.\nAdaptive laboratory evolution\nTiming: 12–15 h per growth cycle\nALE of AMR is facilitated here using a serial passaging protocol involving repeated growth cycles of bacteria in the appropriate concentration of antibiotic to establish ‘lineages’ of evolving bacterial populations. Each lineage represents a single replicate of the ALE experiment. The following protocol is described for triplicate lineages of E. coli grown in culture volumes of 3 mL, with a 1% bottleneck at each passage. The protocol can be easily adapted for different replicate numbers, culture volumes and bottlenecks (see notes below).\nUsing the primary culture, inoculate 30 μL into 3 mL of growth media with antibiotic at appropriate concentration in triplicate.\nLabel the above as lineages A-C.\nIn parallel, inoculate 30 μL into 3 mL of growth media without antibiotic to establish lineages D-F.\nNote: These control lineages serve to identify changes specifically due to antibiotic exposure.",
    "Incubate cultures at 37°C for 12–15 h (or for determined amount of time) with shaking at 180–200 rpm.\nThe above culture represents the first growth cycle (or passage 1) of the ALE experiment. Use this culture to reinoculated into fresh media with antibiotic added at the appropriate concentration to initiate growth cycle 2 (or passage 2).\nRepeat for as many cycles of growth as needed (see notes below).\nNote: When planning for ALE Steps 4-9 the following parameters should be carefully considered:\nScale of evolution experiment:\nThe number of replicates and volume of culture per replicate are important parameters to consider when performing an ALE experiment. When a large number of replicates are desirable (>10) using small culture volumes of 150–200 μL in 96-well plates is most convenient. Typically, mutation rates of 1 in 108/9 are observed for most antibiotic resistant mutants, which limits the number of mutants in each replicate to 1 or 2 for ∼200 μL cultures. If a greater number of mutations are desirable (say, when the effect of competition between different mutants is to be assessed) we recommend using culture volumes of 1 mL or more. In this case, using sterile 50 mL centrifuge tubes or glass tubes ensures sufficient aeration of the culture and convenient handling. Ensure that at least 3 replicate evolving lineages are propagated to test for reproducibility of the ALE.\nDuration and number of generations of evolution:",
    "The number of generations for which the evolution experiment is to be performed strongly influences the outcome of ALE experiments. A standard ALE experiment for isolating drug-resistant bacteria can be performed for 20–100 generations, though longer experiments may be required to answer specific types of questions. Two parameters, i.e., passage bottleneck and number of passages of ALE, can be conveniently adjusted in order to achieve the desired number of generations of evolution. Passage bottleneck of 0.1%–10% can be used for the ALE experiment, though 1% is most commonly employed which results in 6–7 generations per growth cycle. To calculate number of generations with each growth cycle use the following formula:\n   2 g  = d i l  \nWhere g: number of generations per growth cycle.\ndil: dilution factor at each passage (i.e., 100 for 1% passage).\nFreezing of evolving lineages\nTiming: 10–15 min at each growth cycle\nFreezing the evolving lineages intermittently ensures that a ‘fossil record’ of the various stages of AMR evolution are preserved. This step is useful to trace the genetic or phenotypic trajectories that resistant bacteria took to evolve. Frozen stocks are also useful for more practical reasons since they can be used to re-initiate the ALE experiment from an intermediate time point in case of contamination, thus saving time. We routinely freeze populations every 10 passages (∼60–70 generations) for long ALE experiments and more frequently for shorter duration experiments in addition to the final evolved population at the end of the ALE experiment.\nAdd 500 μL of the evolved culture at the desired time point to be frozen in a sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nTo it, add 500 μL sterile 50% glycerol.\nGently mix by pipetting until homogeneous.\nLabel the tube with passage number/number of generations, antibiotic and lineage name (i.e., A-F).\nStore at −80°C.",
    "Checking for contamination\nTiming: 15–20 h\nTesting for contamination is crucial at regular intervals, for example before freezing, as it ensures purity of the culture. Contaminating microorganisms, usually other bacteria or yeast can take over the evolving population or affect the evolution of the test organism, particularly during long-term ALE experiments. If contamination is detected, it is advisable to re-start the ALE experiment from the last ‘clean’ frozen stock. Following are some of the possible quality control steps that may be employed at regular intervals during the ALE experiment.\nQuality control steps to check for contamination:\nVisual cues: Alteration in color or turbidity of growth media can be visible to the naked eye and may indicate contamination. If such signs are observed, test the purity of the evolved cultures using steps b and c.\nMicroscopic examination: Perform Gram’s staining for the evolving populations, and ensure the expected Gram characteristics and morphology is observed.\nColony characteristics:\nDip a nichrome loop in the culture/frozen stock to be tested for contamination and streak out onto the surface of an antibiotic-free LA plate.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 15–20 h.\nNote any deviations from the expected colony characteristics, for example, alterations in colony color, size, margin, etc.\nNote: Changes in colony characteristics, in particular size, can be expected even for uncontaminated cultures as resistant bacteria may often have different growth characteristics than the ancestor. If a change in colony characteristics or heterogenous colony morphologies are observed, it is advisable to perform a Gram stain to distinguish between contaminants and evolved bacteria.",
    "Often contamination by the same species of bacteria is also observed and can usually be the result of media, pipettes or other commonly used equipment being contaminated. This kind of contamination will go unnoticed by the methods listed in step 12. Maintaining a ‘no-bacteria’ control tube at each passage can help identify such kinds of contamination.\nTracking AMR evolution, method 1: Enumeration and isolation of phenotypically resistant bacteria\nTiming: 3 days\nTracking the evolution of resistant bacteria over the progress of the ALE experiment and isolation of resistant clones are critical for any downstream characterization steps, such as genotyping or phenotypic analyses. Quantitative estimates of how quickly resistant bacteria take over the population can also be useful in testing the effects of drug combinations or other environmental factors.\nEnumeration of resistant bacteria (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2327-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Tracking the evolution of resistance by enumerating the titers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria\nThe evolution of resistance in the ALE experiment can be tracked by counting the fraction of resistant bacteria in the population at different time points. A simple colony formation assay (shown diagrammatically) can be used to determine what fraction of the evolving population is phenotypically resistant and can also be used to isolate resistant clones for further characterization. An illustrative example from E. coli evolving in sub-inhibitory trimethoprim from 2 different time points is shown. Here, bacterial populations from 35 and 350 generations of evolution were serially diluted and grown on LA (-trimethoprim) and LA (+ trimethoprim at 1× MIC).\nInoculate 10–20 μL of frozen stocks from desired timepoints in 3 mL of LB and allow the culture to grow for 12–15 h at 37°C with shaking at 180–200 rpm.\nDilute the culture 10-fold by mixing 900 μL of sterile LB and 100 μL of culture.",
    "Repeat step b serially until a dilution factor of 106 is achieved.\nDrop 10 μL of each dilution of the culture on an antibiotic-free LA plate (for total bacterial count) and antibiotic supplemented LA plate (for resistant bacterial count).\nAllow the drop to dry with the lid of the plate open.\nAfter the drop has dried, close the plate lid and incubate for 12–15 h at 37°C.\nCount the number of colonies from the highest dilution that shows discrete colonies from both plates.\nCalculate the total bacterial count and resistant bacterial count as Colony Forming Units (CFU) per mL using the following formulae:\n  T o t a l  b a c t e r i a l  c o u n t s   (  C F U  p e r  m L  )  = N u m b e r  o f  c o l o n i e s  o n  L A  p l a t e  x  100  x  d i l u t i o n  f a c t o r  \n  R e s i s t a n t  b a c t e r i a l  c o u n t s   (  C F U  p e r  m L  )  = N u m b e r  o f  c o l o n i e s  o n  a n t i b i o t i c  p l a t e  x  100  x  d i l u t i o n  f a c t o r",

We routinely use 1–2× MIC concentration to discriminate between colonies of ancestral (drug-sensitive) and evolved (drug-resistant) bacteria. e.g., for trimethoprim we use 1× MIC (1 μg/mL). Alternatively, clinical breakpoint concentrations of antibiotics can be used to isolate resistant bacteria. While doing so results in greater clinical relevancy, it is possible to miss novel adaptations that confer low-level resistance. We therefore advise choosing an objective-appropriate concentration of antibiotic during this step.\nIt is advisable to re-streak isolates derived from the ALE experiment in order to purify them before freezing.\nValidation of resistant bacteria\nTiming: 3 days\nRevive resistant isolates derived from the ALE by inoculating 10 μL of frozen stock into 3 mL of LB and grow for 12–15 h at 37°C with shaking at 180–200 rpm.\nCalculate the MIC of the isolates against the antibiotic used during the ALE experiment as described earlier.",
    "Note: An increase in MIC by at least 2-fold compared to the ancestor can be considered as a resistant phenotype for laboratory strains. However, with increase in the number of generations and/or the concentration of antibiotic used for evolution, the MIC may increase to a level beyond the clinical breakpoint. Using the clinical breakpoint to define resistance evolution may also be considered, depending on the question being addressed in the ALE experiment.\nTracking of AMR evolution: Method 2: Using competitive quotient to track the progress of ALE\nTiming: 3 days\nSince adaptation to antibiotics involves a progressive enhancement of competitive fitness relative to the ancestor in the presence of the antibiotic, this property can also be used to evaluate the progress of the ALE experiment. Conventionally relative fitness is calculated using competition with a genetically marked ancestor and enumerating the relative proportions of ancestral and evolved bacteria using colony counts or flow cytometry. We have developed a quicker protocol using a GFP-marked derivative of the ancestral strain. This method doesn’t deliver the relative fitness directly, but can be used to track the competitive fitness of evolving bacteria indirectly by calculating the ‘competitive quotient’.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Since this procedure doesn’t involve colony counting or cell sorting, it can be easily used for comparing a large number of replicates or conditions.\nRevive the frozen stocks of evolving populations derived from the ALE by inoculating 10 μL into 3 mL of LB. Grow for 12–15 h at 37°C with shaking at 180–200 rpm.\nIn parallel, revive GFP-tagged ancestral strain (E. coli-GFP) by inoculating 10 μL of frozen stock into 3 mL of LB and grow for 12–15 h at 37°C with shaking at 180–200 rpm.",
    "Into 3 mL LB (± antibiotic at the concentration used during ALE) add 15 μL each of saturated cultures of evolved populations and GFP-tagged ancestor.\nMix well by vortexing.\nAs controls set up the following cultures:\nMix 15 μL each of ancestor and GFP-tagged ancestor in 3 mL LB (± antibiotic at the concentration used during ALE).\nNote: This control is used to determine the fitness effects of GFP expression.\nInoculate 30 μL of GFP-tagged ancestor to 3 mL LB (± antibiotic at the concentration used during ALE).\nNote: This control is used to determine effect of antibiotic on GFP fluorescence, if any.\nAllow mixed cultures to grow at 37°C for 12–15 h with shaking at 180–200 rpm.\nAliquot 200 μL of each competition into a 96-well plate (in duplicate for each culture). Also inoculate 200 μL from each of the control tubes.\nMeasure the optical density at 600 nm and GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate reader.\nDilute the culture as needed to ensure that values of GFP and optical density are within the range of the plate reader used.\nNormalize all GFP values by dividing the value of raw fluorescence with OD at 600 nm (nGFP).\nCalculate competitive quotient using the following formula:\n    c o m p e t i t i v e  q u o t i e n t =  [   {  n G F P  ( c )  − n G F P  ( t )   }  −  {  n G F P  ( c )  − n G F P  (  w t  )   }   ]    [  n G F P  ( c )  − n G F P  (  w t  )   ]",
    "where, nGFP(c), nGFP(t) and nGFP(wt) are the normalized GFP fluorescence values of E. coli-GFP alone, mixed culture of E. coli-GFP and test strain, and mixed culture of E. coli-GFP and ancestor respectively.\nCompare competitive quotient for different number of generations under antibiotic selection in LB + antibiotic to assess adaptation to the antibiotic and antibiotic-free LB to assess the fitness cost of adaptation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2327-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Tracking of the evolution of resistance by calculating the competitive quotient using a GFP-expressing ancestor\nThe above schematic shows the set-up of a series of competition experiments that can be used to determine the ‘competitive quotient’ of the evolving populations.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This is a quick and simple method for tracking adaptation to antibiotic in the evolving lineages and provides an alternative to CFU or cytometry-based approaches to determine relative fitness.\nMutation mapping in evolved isolates: Method 1: Targeted sequencing of resistance-associate genetic loci\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nAntibiotic-resistant mutants isolated in step 13 can be further analyzed to identify resistance-conferring mutations. If specific gene loci are expected to be implicated, a targeted sequencing approach can be used. However, if no information regarding expected mutations is available or if novel genetic determinants of AMR are to be investigated, unbiased whole genome sequencing approaches are required. While the latter are more costly, they can reveal interesting aspects of how adaptation to antibiotics is mediated in bacteria. For bacteria with assembled genomes, this can be a very powerful tool for discovery. Both protocols involve extracting genomic DNA from the resistant isolate as the first step. We routinely use the following for our experiments.\nPreparation of genomic DNA from drug-resistant isolates and ancestral strain.\nInoculate 10 μL of frozen stock of antibiotic-resistant isolate and ancestor into 3 mL of LB.",
    "Grow for 12–15 h at 37°C with shaking at 180–200 rpm.\nHarvest cells in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube by centrifugation and resuspend in 500 μL Tris-EDTA buffer by vortexing vigorously.\nAdd 25 μL of 10% SDS, mix by inverting the tube and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nAdd 2 μL of Proteinase K (20 mg/mL) to the tube and incubate at 60°C for 3–4 h.\nAdd 500 μL of phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and mix well by inverting.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 g using a fixed angle rotor in a table top centrifuge.\nTransfer upper aqueous layer to a fresh microfuge tube using a wide-bore or cut pipette tip.\nPrecipitate DNA by adding 0.2 volumes of 3 M Sodium Acetate and 2.5 volumes of chilled 95%–100% ethanol, and gently inverting the tube.\nNote: Genomic DNA will appear as thin white/grey fibres.\nIf precipitate is not immediately visible, incubate on ice for 5–10 min.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 13,000 g and discard the supernatant.\nWash the pellet with 1 mL of chilled 70% ethanol.\nAllow pellet to dry, and resuspend in 50–100 μL of Tris-EDTA buffer.\nNote: Incubate at 37°C for 1 h if the pellet does not dissolve at 25°C.\nAdd 1 μL RNase A (10 mg/mL) and incubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nCheck 2.5–5 μL on a 1% agarose gel and visualize using any intercalating dye.\nStore genomic DNA at −20°C until further use.\nNote: If high purity genomic DNA is required, then the above DNA can be further purified using commercial silica-based spin columns.\nThe above genomic DNA can be used directly as PCR template using gene-specific primers to amplify the region of the interest. For PCR amplification, we routinely use the following parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2327_2.csv",
    "PCR products from ancestral and drug-resistant samples can be subjected to Sanger sequencing using the forward and/or reverse primers.\nComparison of the sequences from ancestor and drug-resistant isolates can be performed by a simple sequence alignment and will reveal mutations, if any, present in the resistant isolates.\nMutation mapping in evolved isolates: Method 2: Using short-read genome resequencing data for identifying novel mutations\nTiming: Variable, depending on number of sequenced isolates\nIllumina-based sequencing has become very accessible and affordable in recent years and is a powerful tool to re-sequence bacterial genomes from ALE experiments. We routinely acquire paired end raw data from sequencing runs as .fastq files from commercial sequencing service providers and use breseq for identifying mutations compared to the ancestor. Breseq is a pipeline that was developed by J.E. Barrick with the aim of analyzing genome re-sequencing data from long-term evolution experiments9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] and is an excellent tool for haploid genomes. Sequencing data of 1–2 GB per sequenced genome provides sufficient depth for most experiments. For well-worked out genomes such as E. coli, lower depths of reads can also provide reliable information regarding mutations and can cut down costs significantly. It is crucial to sequence the ancestor used for the ALE along with evolved isolates/population to rule out pre-existing mutations if any. Described below is a step-by-step protocol for using short-read paired-end data from Illumina sequencing to map mutations that may be involved in drug-resistance acquisition.\nInstall breseq according to the developer’s instructions, taking care to install breseq and dependencies appropriate to the operating system of the workstation.\nNote: Extensive documentation regarding installation and running breseq can be found on the Barrick lab webpage[href=https://barricklab.org/twiki/pub/Lab/ToolsBacterialGenomeResequencing/documentation/introduction.html].\nDownload an assembled and annotated reference genome from any publicly accessible genome sequence repository.",
    "Note: For E. coli K-12 MG166 strain, we use U00096.3 (GenBank) as the reference for all subsequent analyses. Using the most recent assembly lowers the chance of false positives in the analysis.\nRun breseq for sequencing reads from ancestral genome against the reference genome downloaded in step 31.\nNote: This run should take 45–90 min, depending on the size of the data and processing capability of the workstation used. Breseq generates an easy to navigate output as an .html file that can be opened in most browsers. It also generates outputs as .txt files that are easier to work with for archiving or searching.\nRun breseq for sequencing reads from evolved isolates against the same reference genome as used in 32.\nIdentify all genomic changes relative to the output that are predicted in the evolved isolate, but absent from the ancestor. Following categories of mutations are possible to identify using breseq:\nGene duplication/amplification: Large gene duplication and/or amplification events can be inferred based on coverage depth plots.\nNote: Since bacterial genomes are haploid, the ancestral genome should have roughly the same read depth distribution across all genomic positions. However, bacterial genomes under antibiotic selection can often undergo amplifications of certain regions, which appear as stretches of higher coverage depth than the rest of the genome.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] These amplifications are usually mediated by mobilization of IS elements. As a result, confirming the presence of repeat sequences flanking the amplified region can be used as a confirmation of the output from breseq.\nSingle nucleotide substitutions/deletions/insertions: Single nucleotide substitutions/deletions/insertions are directly predicted by breseq.",
    "Note: The predictions made by breseq can be confirmed using the evidence alignment provided along with the output. Marginal predictions, i.e., those that don’t make the statistical cut-off can also be considered, provided the evidence alignments are in agreement with the prediction.\nLarge deletions/transpositions: Large genomic deletions or transposition events are often predicted as ‘unassigned junctions’ by breseq.\nNote: These predictions are based on the premise that large genomic changes create novel junctions between DNA sequences. Evaluating the relevance of large deletions or transpositions by analysing the evidence alignment is crucial to ensure that the predictions are valid. For validating transpositions events for IS elements, looking for pairs of novel junctions (one for each end of the IS element) can provide confirmatory evidence."
