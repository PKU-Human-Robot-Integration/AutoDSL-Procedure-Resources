    "Preparation of the protein G column Resuspend two vials of protein G Sepharose (5 mL each) in 50 mL of Hartmann’s solution in a 50-mL tube.Centrifuge at 41 × g for 5 min, gently pour off the Hartmann’s solution by decantation, and add fresh Hartmann’s solution to top up the 50-mL tube; repeat twice.Wash the column with 100% ethanol, and then with Hartmann’s solution.Add protein G solution to the column with a plastic Pasteur pipette until the column is full. The two-way stopcock should be closed (horizontal) to avoid the loss of protein G. The length of the packed protein G column should be 6–8 cm (the empty colums is 12cm)\".Open the two-way stopcock (vertical) and let all the solution slowly run down (to allow the protein G to deposit at the bottom of the column). Do not permit protein G to dry, always leave at least 1 mL of Hartmann’s solution on top of the beads (Figure 1A).Running the sample through the protein G column Centrifuge the serum at 2,000 × g for 15 min to get rid of particulates before dilution. A second centrifugation may be required to achieve this.Dilute the serum 1:3 in Hartmann’s solution: 20 mL of serum and 40 mL of Hartmann’s solution, for a total of 60 mL of diluted serum.Add the diluted serum (60 mL) to the column with a plastic Pasteur pipette. Run the serum slowly through the column, adjusting the stopcock to half closed for 1 drop/second, and setting 1 min on a timer (1 mL of IgG should pass through the column in 1 min). Firstly, top up the column with serum, then open the stopcock and start the purification. Continue topping up the column until all serum is transferred into the column.",
    "Run the diluted serum slowly (1 mL/min) through, and collect the flow through in a 50-mL tube.Run the flow through through the column again, then discard or store the flow through for further analysis (Figure 1B).Washing any non-specific binding with HS Run 60–100 mL of Hartmann’s solution through the column, to wash away any non-specific binding (Figure 1C).Check Hartmann’s flow through for IgG, using the Bradford reagent: Resuspend 20 μL of eluted flow through in 100 μL of Bradford reagent, using a well of a 96-well plate. Continue adding Hartmann’s solution until no blue colour is detected, then start eluting with glycine (Procedure D). The blue colour means that there are still other unbound protein in the column (not IgG) that should be removed before elution.Elution with glycine pH 2.3 and Tris pH 8.0 Place 30 Eppendorf tubes (1.5 mL) on ice. Add 100 μL of 1 M Tris, pH 8.0 into each tube (Figure 1D).Add 30 mL of 100 mM glycine pH 2.3 to the column, and elute 900 μL of flow through into each prepared tube. Run glycine slowly through the column, adjusting the stopcock to half closed for 1 drop/second and setting 1 min on a timer (1 mL of IgG should pass through the column in 1 min). Firstly, top up the column with glycine, then open the stopcock and start elution from the first tube. When the column needs to be topped up, close the stopcock and add glycine, as above. Shake each fraction, to neutralize glycine with Tris and to protect the sample. Usually, there is no IgG in the first four tubes.",
    "Check the presence of IgG in all tubes using the Bradford assay: Resuspend 20 μL of eluted solution from each tube with 100 μL of Bradford reagent using 30 wells of a 96-well plate. The last tube should have no blue colour.Pool the highly concentrated fractions, as indicated by the intense blue colour, into one 50-mL tube. For 20 mL of serum (diluted in 40 mL of Harmann’s = 60 mL of overall solution), the yield should be approximately 20 tubes.Run 60 mL of Hartmann’s Solution (1 mL/min) to remove any residual glycine from the column.Check if there is no glycine in the flow through with the Bradford assay, as in step D3.Store the column at 4 °C in 20% ethanol to prevent contaminations. The same column can be used up to five times.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4562/bioprotoc-12-23-4562-g001.jpgFigure 1. IgG purification steps. A. Column preparation. Wash the column with 20 mL of 100% ethanol and then 20 mL of binding buffer (HS), and then add the protein G Sepharose slurry from the vials to the column. B. Serum running. Slowly apply diluted serum to the column twice (1 mL/min). C. column washing. Wash protein G beads in 100 mL of binding buffer. D. Elute the bound IgG fraction by adding 20 mL of 100 mM glycine pH 2.3 to the column, and collect in 20 tubes (1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes) pre-filled with Tris buffer. E. IgG dialysis. Dialyse purified IgG at 4 °C overnight in Hartmann’s solution using a 10 kDa dialysis membrane. F. IgG concentration. Move the IgG from the beaker into a tray, covered with sucrose and left until has reached the right concentration; the sucrose starts to slowly liquefy after approximately 20 min and the sample is concentrated 2x after 1 h. G. IgG aggregates.",
    "IgG aggregates (red circle) may form during overnight dialysis, but these can be removed with a spin at 657 × g for 10 min.Dialysis Fill a beaker with 1 L of Hartmann’s solution.Cut approximately 10 cm of snakeskin dialysis tubing, fold over one end, and secure with a clip. Then, pipette the IgG solution into it, leaving approximately an extra third volume of air.Fold over the top and secure with a clip.Place the dialysis bag into the beaker and leave it on a stirrer at 4°C, allowing the sample to dialyse overnight (Figure 1E).Sucrose concentration Move the dialysis preparation from the beaker into a tray, cover with sucrose, and leave until the sample has reached the right concentration—the exact time will depend upon the starting concentration of the dialysed sample, as it may take a couple of hours and it may need sucrose changing after 1 h (Figure 1E).Transfer the sample into a 50-mL tube.Centrifuge the sample at 657 × g for 10 min and transfer the IgG solution into a fresh tube to remove aggregates. Aggregates may still form later but they can be removed with another spin at 657 × g for 10 min (Figure 1G).Filter the sample through a 0.2 μm filter.Store the IgG sample at 4 °C."
