    "These experiments were conducted in compliance with NIH laboratory animal care guidelines and approved by the Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Chronic corticosterone (CORT)\nRandomly assign mice to treatment groups. Randomly divide adult male C57BL/6J mice into Vehicle and Corticosterone (CORT) groups.\n\t\nHouse vehicle mice in distinct cages, and CORT mice in others, as their treatment is delivered via the cage’s water bottle.\nLabel special water cards to place in the cage that notifies animal care staff that the water bottles contain solutions necessary for the experiment.\nMake a vehicle solution by dissolving 3.375 g of beta-cyclodextrin into 750 mL of tap water in a size 1 L screw-top glass container.\n\t\nFill vehicle cage water bottles with this solution. Ensure that the bottle does not leak to measure liquid consumption.\nLabel the container and store at room temperature on the shelf in the laboratory. Use the vehicle solution to fill cage bottles for about 1 week.\nRefill vehicle bottles throughout the week. Refill cage bottles 1x-2x during the week as necessary. Change to a fresh bottle 1x per week either at the beginning or end of the week.\n\t\tNOTE: After one week, the beta-cyclodextrin will start to coat the inside of the water bottle and makes the solution cloudy.\nMonitor amount of liquid consumed twice a week and record. Weigh each respective bottle and record, careful not to spill any liquid. Refill and return each bottle.\n\t\tNOTE: A cage of 5 mice will drink 80-120 mL of liquid in 3-4 days.\nMake the CORT solution by first dissolving 3.375 g of beta-cyclodextrin into 750 mL of tap water in a size 1 L screw-top glass container. Then add 26.25 mg of corticosterone.",
    "Sonicate CORT solution to dissolve CORT into the water. Place the container in an ultrasonic cleaner water bath. Sonicate at 40 kHz for approximately 30 min or until corticosterone is dissolved and liquid appears clear.\n\t\tNOTE: Ultrasonic homogenizers (tip-style) are also effective for dissolving CORT.\nFill water bottles for all CORT cages with solution. Label container and store at room temperature on shelf in lab. CORT solution can be used to fill cage bottles for about 1 week.\n\t\tNOTE: Use brown glass water bottles or plastic opaque bottles, as CORT is light-sensitive.\nMonitor the amount of liquid consumed twice a week and record. Weigh all vehicle and CORT mice weekly to compare the liquid consumed to the weight of mice within each cage.\nTo determine volume of liquid consumed (mL/g/day), use the following equation:\n\t\t(Volume cage drank in the past 3-4 days) / (Average body weight of mice in the cage) X number of days since Vehicle or CORT bottle has been re-filled)\n\t\tNOTE: An average cage of n=5 adult male C57BL/6J mice will consume on average 0.25 – 0.30 mg/g/day, which typically remains consistent through ad libitum and food-deprived time periods. These concentrations result in approximate doses of 24 mg/kg/day beta-cyclodextrin, and 9.5 mg/kg/day CORT15,16.\nSocial Defeat Stress (SDS)\n\t\nUse standard social defeat stress protocols as described in depth elsewhere24,29.\nY-Maze barrier task\n\t\nFood deprivation for the Y-maze barrier task\n\t\t\nThe day after completing the social interaction test, weigh all Control and Experimental mice. This will be their free-feeding body weight.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Herein, we use “Control” and “Experimental” to refer to both SDS Control and SDS Experimental mice, as well as to Vehicle and CORT-administered mice in the respective SDS and CORT paradigms.\nTo food deprive the mice, only remove lab chow from the C57BL/6J side of each cage.",
    "Weigh all mice, as well as the amount of lab chow that will be given daily, in order to properly maintain body weight at approximately 90% of free-feeding weight throughout testing.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The amount of food delivered in the home cage of each mouse or mice will depend on fluctuating body weight and the amount of reward pellets consumed in each day of training or testing in the Y-maze.\nEstablish familiarity with the reward pellets. Dump a small scoopful of 20 mg of grain-based food pellets (Bio-Serv) into the home cage. This will establish familiarly with the pellets and motivate the mice to consume them in the Y-maze in habituating and initial training sessions.\nY-maze apparatus\n\t\nConstruct a Y-maze structure of opaque white 3/16” width Plexiglas, with three arms measuring 26 cm in length, 20 cm in height, and 7 cm in width.\nUse dividers that slide between slots in the Y-maze to allow for a researcher to close off the start box where the mice are initially placed, or to contain the mouse into either arm once they have selected and entered the left or right arms of the Y-maze.\nCreate multiple 10, 15, and 20 cm tall Y-maze barriers out of wire mesh for the vertical side, and with Plexiglas at approximately a 45° angle on the back angled side. This allows C57BL/6J mice to grip and climb up the vertical wire mesh side of each barrier, and then traverse down the angled Plexiglas side of the barrier.\n\t\t\nAdd thin steps on the angled side to allow for greater traction.\nY-maze habituation\n\t\nHabituate all Control and Experimental mice to the Y-maze apparatus.",
    "The day after food deprivation, place a large number of 20 mg grain-based food pellets (e.g., Bio-Serv) in the cap of a 50 mL centrifuge tube and place at the ends of each arm of the Y-maze. These caps serve as small food receptacles for the mice, and the mice will readily learn to eat the food pellets.\nPlace each mouse in the start box of the Y-maze with the start box divider in place.\nAfter a few seconds, remove the divider, allowing each mouse to explore the Y-maze for 15 min. This amount of time allows the mouse to adequately explore all arms of the maze and to establish familiarity with the apparatus.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Some mice may not consume any food pellets in this first habituation day.\nOn the following day, complete a second 15 min Y-maze habituation using an identical procedure.\n\t\t\nNote any mice that have not eaten any pellets. For these mice, dump another small scoopful of pellets into their home cages.\nY-maze forced-choice training\n\t\nDesignate the high reward (HR) and low reward (LR) arm for each mouse.\n\t\t\nRandomly assign mice in both Control and Experimental groups the left arm as the high reward (HR) arm and the right arm as the low reward (LR) arm, or vice versa. Thus, 4 pellets will be available in each trial in the left, HR arm, and 2 pellets available in the right, LR arm, or the opposite.\nCounterbalance these designated LR and HR arms in both Control and Experimental group so that approximately half of each group had the left arm as the HR arm, and half had the right arm as the HR arm.\nForced choice trials\n\t\t\nFollowing the 2 days of Y-maze habituation, have mice begin 3 days of 10 trials of forced-choice training.",
    "For each forced-choice trial, place the mouse in the start box, and then remove the divider, allowing the mouse 60 s to enter either the left or right arm and consume the available pellets. For each forced-choice trial block off the opposite arm with the divider, forcing the mouse to select the other arm. For a HR forced choice trial, block access to the LR arm, or vice versa.\nRemove the mouse after the trial and replenish the respective pellets that were eaten.\nAlternate forced choice trials for each mouse across each training day, so that mice complete 5 HR and 5 LR forced-choice trials.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Forced-choice trials train the mice to associate one arm with the higher reward and the other with the lower reward.\nPlace the mouse back into its home cage and then run no more than 3-5 subsequent mice in order to maintain a 5 min intertrial interval for each mouse.\nY-maze free choice training\n\t\nFree choice trials\n\t\t\nBegin each free choice session with a HR and LR arm forced-choice trial. Thus, mice will have experienced being forced into each arm prior to beginning 10 free choice trials.\nPlace each mouse in the start box and remove the divider. Once the mouse has selected an arm and traversed it to the end where the cup containing the pellets is located, place the arm divider in place on that side, locking in the mouse until it has consumed the pellets.\nRemove the mouse back to its home cage and run the subsequent 3-5 mice used in that cycle to allow a 5 min inter-trial interval.\nRecord the following data: latency to choose an arm, arm selection, and latency to reach pellet cup.",
    "Record which arm the mouse enters and fully traverses to the pellet cup. Also record the latency to select that arm and reach the pellet cup.\nConsider any trial where a mouse fails to select an arm or does not consume all 4 or 2 pellets as an omitted trial.\n70% free choice criterion\n\t\t\nRecord which arm is selected for all 10 free choice trials daily.\nOnce a mouse has selected the HR arm on 7 out of the 10 trials in a free choice training day (70% criterion), move the mouse on to barrier testing sessions.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Continue free choice training until all mice reach the 70% HR arm criterion to ensure both adequate discrimination of the HR and LR arms and that mice demonstrate equal preference for the HR arm.\nY-maze barrier testing\n\t\n10 cm barrier test session\n\t\t\nPlace the 10 cm barrier halfway down the HR arm in the Y-maze.\nBegin with multiple forced-choice trials for both arms. Mice resistant to climbing the barrier can be prompted with a long, thin Plexiglas piece.\n\t\t\tNOTE: From experience, we recommend at least 2 forced-choice trials for both HR and LR arms at the start of each session at a new barrier height. We recommend recording trials where it is necessary to prompt the mouse to climb over the barrier if it becomes necessary. Mice generally learn to climb over the 10 cm barrier, which is not so high they can’t stand and see over it, within 1-2 trials. The barrier will have to be placed on the other side for mice with the opposing arm as the designated HR arm.",
    "Place each mouse in the start box, remove the divider, and allow the mouse to traverse the maze and select an arm for 10 free choice trials containing the 10 cm barrier in the HR arm.\nIf the mouse chooses the HR side, it will climb over the barrier in order to obtain the greater reward, the 4 pellets. Otherwise, it will select the LR arm and simply traverse the floor of the maze for the lesser reward, 2 pellets.\nRecord the arm selected, and the latency to select an arm and reach the pellet cup for all trials. Similarly rotate 4-6 total mice per cycle, to maintain a 5 min inter-trial interval.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Spray 70% ethanol in the Y-maze and wipe dry consistently and in between each mouse.\n15 cm barrier test session\n\t\t\nOn the following day complete all steps listed as above (step 1.10.1), but with the 15 cm tall barrier in the HR arm.\n20 cm barrier test session\n\t\t\nOn the following day complete all steps listed as above (step 1.10.1), but with the 20 cm tall barrier in the HR arm.\n\t\t\tNOTE: From experience, by the 20 cm barrier height the majority of SDS susceptible or CORT Experimental mice (and even several Control mice) will shift their responses to the LR arm, as they are not motivated enough to climb over the tall 20 cm barrier. Also, Plexiglas adaptors may need to be used in order to prevent mice from climbing from the top of this barrier onto the edges of the Y-maze walls. We do not recommend building a taller Y-maze, as it becomes more difficult for the experimenter to refill the pellets in each cup and to remove the mice after each trial.\nReward discrimination test session",
    "To ensure both Control and Experimental mice display adequate and similar levers of reward discrimination, conduct a Discrimination test session.\nFollow all above steps (step 1.10.1) but place a 10 cm barrier in the LR arm. Now, both arms contain 10 cm barriers, and the mice will need to climb over either to obtain the 4 or 2 pellet reward.\nRecord latency and arm selection for all 10 trials.\n\t\t\tNOTE: As mice will have to expend the same effort to obtain either reward, mice should select the HR arm in most trials. To examine latencies to select the HR and LR arm, compute a mean HR arm latency and a mean LR arm latency for each individual mouse. Then, compare latency to select both arms using a two-way mixed ANOVA, with SDS (Control, SDS-Susceptible, SDS-Resilient) as the between-subjects factor, and arm (HR arm, LR arm) as the within-subjects factor.\n2. Chronic Non-Discriminatory Social Defeat Stress (CNSDS)\nScreen for aggressive behavior in CD-1 mice\n\t\nPlace one male and one female C57BL/6J mouse into the home cage of each CD-1 for 180 s or until the CD-1 attacks both mice. These C57BL6/J mice do not need to be naïve, and will not be used in any further experiments. During this aggressor screening phase, do not cohouse C57BL/6J mice with CD-1 mice.\n\t\t\nRecord latency to attack both C57BL/6J mice for each CD-1.\nSelect all CD-1 aggressors that attack both male and female C57BL/6J mice within 60 seconds on consecutive sessions out of a total of 3 screening sessions. Others can be used for co-housing in home cages.",
    "NOTE: An important caveat of social defeat is the presence of wounding as a consequence of physical aggression. Each mouse in the screening and experimental phases should be checked for wounds and treated with chloro-hexane disinfectant if small skin lesions present. Any mouse with a wound greater than 1 cm should be removed from the experiment.\nAssign mice to control and experimental groups.\n\t\nGather all naïve adult male and female C57BL/6J mice, as well as screened retired male CD-1 breeders, as well as CD-1 males to be used in co-housing.\n\t\t\nRandomly assign adult male and female C57BL/6J mice to control or experimental conditions. Each male and female will be paired for all social defeat sessions in the CNSDS Experimental group. Males and females in the CNSDS Control group will rotate each day.\nAssign CD-1 males to be used in social defeat sessions or be co-housed with the experimental males and females after each session, which will alternate daily for each pair of C57BL/6J male and female mice.\nChronic non-discriminatory social defeat stress (CNSDS)\n\t\nBring all mice to dedicated social defeat room, including all CD-1 males, CNSDS Control male and female C57BL/6J mice, and CNSDS Experimental male and female C57BL/6J mice.\n\t\t\nAlign 4-6 cages of CD-1 males with C57BL/6J males and females with CD-1 cages in the front and C57BL/6J cages behind.\nIndicate with cage ID tags which mouse is being attacked and then co-housed with which CD-1 to ensure organization of all mice.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After initializing experiments on first day, mice can be rotated for remaining 9 defeat sessions such that each C57BL/6J male and female pair are rotated one cage to the left for each session. This allows for a new interaction with novel CD-1s in every session.\nCNSDS Experimental Group Procedure",
    "Place one adult male and one adult female C57BL/6J mouse into the home cage of each CD-1 aggressor male for a 5 min social defeat session.\nRecord attack latency and frequency of attack for both male and female experimental C57BL/6J mice.\nAfter 5 minutes, remove male C57BL/6J mouse and place in cage of co-housed CD-1 male, separated by a clear, perforated Plexiglas barrier. Separate attacking CD-1 and female C57BL/6J mouse with a similar clear, perforated Plexiglas barrier. Alternate whether male or female C57BL/6J mouse is housed with the aggressor CD-1 each day.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Following each daily 5 min interaction each mouse will be assessed for injuries and wounds treated if less than 1cm. Any wound that is larger than 1 cm will result in the removal and immediate euthanasia of the mouse. Thus, both male and female experimental mice are co-housed with the CD-1 aggressor for 5 days and with the novel CD-1 not used in the attack session for the remaining 5 days. Clear, perforated Plexiglas barriers prevent physical interaction but allow for sensory contact with CD-1 aggressor in the 24 hours between sessions. Vaginal lavage can be performed on all female mice approximately 30 minutes following defeat every day as described previously28.\nCNSDS Control Group Procedure\n\t\t\nPlace one Control female in home cage of one Control male C57BL/6J mouse.\nAfter 5 min, separate mice and place a clear, perforated Plexiglas divider between the mice.\nReturn mice to colony room and place on a separate shelf as CNSDS Experimental cages. In the colony room we have designated shelves where stressed mice are housed separately from other mice in the colony room. Additionally, effects may be seen in the non-stressed mice if they witnessed the aggression taking place, as is seen in vicarious social defeat paradigms30",
    "Note any attack or mounting behavior during each Control interaction.\nControl male and female mice will be introduced to a new conspecific on subsequent days as is done in traditional Social Defeat Stress Control groups. Complete 10 consecutive days of CNSDS Control and Experimental Sessions.\n\t\t\nAfter completing the 10th and final Control or Experimental CNSDS session, co-house all mice and maintain this co-housing throughout all behavioral testing. Each cage will consist of 2 mice that are separated on either side of plexiglass divider to permit sensory exposure. Control mice are housed with other opposite sex control mice, while experimental mice are co-housed with opposite sex experimental mice.\nEach Control C57BL/6J female is co-housed with the Control C57BL/6J male it interacted with in the 10th session, with a clear, plexiglass divider placed into the cage to separate the two mice.\nApproximately 24 hours following the final defeat session run a standard social interaction test to determine if CNSDS reduces social behavior with a novel CD-1 mouse compared to control, and to stratify mice “resilient” or “susceptible” to the stress24,29.\nTest CNSDS Control and Experimental male and female mice in other behaviors, including the Y-maze barrier task, and stratify the CNSDS group into CNSDS-Resilient and CNSDS-Susceptible groups.\nSocial interaction test\n\t\nInitial setup for Social Interaction Test\n\t\t\n24-hours after the final CNSDS defeat session, conduct a social interaction test.\nTake all pair-housed Control and Experimental mice, as well as a novel CD-1 male not used in the CNSDS paradigm, to a separate behavioral room to run a Social Interaction Test.\nSet up a standard open field chamber (75 cm x 75 cm) underneath a recording camera connected to behavioral tracking software (e.g., EthoVision) running on a dedicated computer.",
    "Set up a new experiment with a 24 cm x 24 cm social interaction zone surrounding an interaction container (small, perforated Plexiglas container measuring approximately 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) that will house the novel CD-1 along one wall of the open field, in the second of 2 consecutive 2.5 min trials. Thus, an interaction zone 7 cm wide surrounds the container housing the novel CD-1 mouse.\nRunning a mouse in the Social Interaction Test\n\t\t\nPlace each mouse in a far corner of the open field for a 2.5 min trial with no CD-1 present and start the recording software program.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Keep in mind that the interaction container should be placed in the center of one wall of the open field and contain no CD-1 mouse for this first trial.\nAfter 2.5 min, remove the mouse back to its home cage. Clean the open field with 70% ethanol.\nPlace the novel CD-1 male into a second perforated Plexiglas cube along the middle of one wall of the open field.\nAgain, place the mouse in the corner of the open field for a second 2.5 min trial, now with the CD-1 present, and start the recording software program.\nRemove the mouse and place it back in its home cage. Remove the CD-1 and place it back in its home cage. Clean the open field with 70% ethanol.\nRun remaining CNSDS Control and Experimental mice and calculate Interaction Ratio.\n\t\t\nRepeat this procedure with all other mice in order to quantify time spent in the interaction zone in both trial 1 and trial 2 for each CNSDS Control and Experimental mouse.\nTo calculate an interaction ratio, compare time spent in the social interaction zone in trial 2 (CD-1 present) versus in trial 1 (CD-1 absent), using the following equation:",
    "Interaction ratio = (time in interaction zone in trial 2)/(time in interaction zone in trial 1)\nStratify mice as “CNSDS-Resilient” or “CNSDS-Susceptible”. Resilient mice have an interaction ratio of > 1.0, whereas susceptible mice have an interaction ratio of <=1.0.\n\t\t\nIn subsequent behavioral measures such as the Y-maze barrier task or other behavior tests, sub-divide CNSDS Experimental mice into these CNSDS-resilient and CNSDS-susceptible phenotypes.\nThus, for females, one-way ANOVAs can be conducted between CNSDS Control, CNSDS Experimental-Resilient, and CNSDS Experimental-Susceptible groups, with post-hoc comparisons to determine differences between groups where appropriate.\nFor sex difference comparisons, conduct two-way ANOVAs with CNSDS (Control, Resilient, Susceptible) and Sex (Male, Female) as between-subjects factors. Use post-hoc comparisons where appropriate.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
