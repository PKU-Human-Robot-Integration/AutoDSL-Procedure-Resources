    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAdipose tissue collecting\nTiming: 0.5–1 h\nThe following steps provide the details for collecting fresh mouse eVAT for adipose tissue progenitor cell isolation.\nSacrifice the mouse using a protocol approved by the performing institution, and spray 70% ethanol over the mouse for sterilization and to minimize contamination.\nDissect the skin and make an incision across the abdominal muscle with forceps and scissors.\nUse forceps to hold the eVAT, slightly pull it up, and adjust the position to expose the entire eVAT pad, testis, and ductus deferens.\nDissect the eVAT together with the testis and epididymis while avoiding the ductus deferens (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3113-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of collected eVAT with the associated testis and epididymis from an 8-week-old mouse\nNote: eVAT size varies at different ages and strains. For C57BL/6 mouse, we recommend collecting both sides of eVAT if the mouse is younger than 4 weeks and collecting one side if the mouse is over 8 weeks of age or under obese status to ensure getting enough cells for RNA-seq and ATAC-seq library construction. If a larger number of cells is needed for additional experiments, eVAT from littermates can be combined to increase the cell yield.\nPause point: At this point, the isolated eVAT can be placed in ice-cold PBS and kept on ice for at least 1 h if multiple samples need to be processed for one experiment. However, it is not recommended to keep the eVAT on ice for more than 6 h to ensure the cell yield and quality.\nAdipose tissue processing and digesting\nTiming: 30 min to 1.5 h",
    "In this part, we describe the detailed procedures to isolate progenitor cells from the stromal vascular fraction of eVAT by enzymatic digestion. These steps provide an efficient and easy way to obtain large amounts of healthy progenitor cells for further applications.\nCarefully rinse the eVAT in PBS to remove as much blood as possible.\nNote: If viewed, remove any remaining undesired tissue, such as the epididymis or hairs.\nTransfer the eVAT into a pre-chilled 2 mL centrifuge tube and add 500 μL digestion buffer.\nNote: The digestion buffer added in this step facilitates mincing and keeps the eVAT from drying. The amount of digestion buffer added is adjustable based on the size of the eVAT. For smaller eVAT (<1 g), 500 μL digestion buffer is enough. For eVAT larger than 1 g, especially eVAT from obese mice, use a 5 mL centrifuge tube and add 1 mL digestion buffer or split the eVAT into several 2 mL tubes, then add 500 μL digestion buffer into each tube.\nMince the eVAT with scissors into ∼1 mm3 pieces and keep the tube on ice until all samples are processed.\nAdd more digestion buffer. For larger eVAT, transfer the suspension to a 5 mL or 14 mL Falcon tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3113-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Examples of different amounts of eVAT, types of tubes, and digestion buffer volume\n(A) A 2 mL tube with 1 mL digestion buffer for <0.5 g eVAT.\n(B) A 5 mL Falcon tube with 2 mL digestion buffer for ∼1.0 g eVAT.\n(C) A 14 mL Falcon tube with 5 mL digestion buffer for ∼2.5 g eVAT.\nNote: For eVAT <0.5 g, use 1 mL of digestion buffer in total. For eVAT >0.5 g, add 1 mL digestion buffer per 0.5 g of tissue.",
    "Critical: Make sure the volume of the suspension is between 40% and 60% of the tube capacity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) to ensure sufficient agitation of the minced eVAT for efficient digestion.\nPlace the centrifuge tube horizontally in a pre-heated shaking incubator at 37°C, 150 rpm for 10–15 min.\nNote: Use parafilm to seal the cap to prevent potential leakage. Mount the tube firmly in the shaking incubator with tape.\nRemove the tube from the incubator. Shake the tube briefly or use a wide-bore pipette tip to pipet the suspension 10 times to facilitate tissue dissociation.\nNote: If adipocytes are desired, allow the cell suspension to stand on the benchtop for 1 min. The upper adipocyte layer can be transferred to a 1.5 mL tube with a wide-bore pipette tip for further processing.\nTransfer the suspension to a pre-chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube and add 10–20 mL ice-cold PBS to stop the digestion (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3113-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of digested eVAT after adding ice-cold PBS\n(A) A well-digested sample.\n(B) An incompletely digested sample. Undigested adipose tissue can be seen in the top floating layer.\nFilter the cell suspension with a 100 μm cell strainer then a 40 μm cell strainer.\nNote: More PBS can be used to wash the cell strainer to increase the cell yield.\nCentrifuge the filtered cell suspension at 600 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the upper lipid layer and the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet mainly containing the stromal vascular cells (SVCs) and immune cells.\nNote: After this step, if your target cell population has a fluorescent marker, like eGFP or tdTomato, please go to step 21 directly.",
    "Optional: Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL red blood cell lysis buffer for 1 min on ice. Add 10–20 mL ice-cold PBS, then centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCell staining\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe following part is to label target progenitor cell populations before cell sorting. If the desired population expresses reporters like eGFP or tdTomato, this part can be skipped.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL cell ice-cold sorting buffer containing 0.5 μL (1:200) fluorophore-conjugated antibodies, such as BV421-anti-Icam1, APC-anti-Dpp4, and PE/Cy7-anti-CD45, to separate different subpopulations of the Tcf21 lineage progenitors.\nNote: For larger cell pellets, 200 μL sorting buffer or more can be used to resuspend.\nTransfer the suspension to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and incubate in the dark for 20 min at 4°C.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold PBS and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL ice-cold cell sorting buffer.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL ice-cold cell sorting buffer.\nNote: Check the cell density under a microscope before proceeding to cell sorting. Dilute if the cell density is too high.\nFACS\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step is to sort out and collect the desired cell population for further study.\nPerform FACS to sort out the desired cell population.\nNote: For RNA-seq, collect 10,000 target cells into 700 μL TRIzol reagent directly. For ATAC-seq, collect 10,000 target cells into 1 mL cell sorting buffer. Library construction using fewer cells is possible, but the protocol may need further optimization.\nATAC-seq library construction\nDNA tagmentation and purification\nCentrifuge the sorted cells at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Carefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nNote: The cell pellet might be hard to see. We recommend using a pipet to remove the last 100 μL supernatant. 1–2 μL residual is acceptable.\nAdd 8.5 μL ice-cold 1× lysis buffer and pipette 10–20 times to fully resuspend the cell pellet.\nIncubate the lysate on ice for 20 min to disrupt the cell membrane.\nNote: 20 min is for SVCs. Optimization of the lysis time needs to be done for different cell types.\nAdd 12.5 μL 2× Tris-DMF tagmentation buffer and 2 μL Nextera Tn5 transposase (TDE1). Pipette to fully mix.\nNote: DO NOT vortex to mix the lysate. Adjust the enzyme usage if you are using more cells.\nIncubate in a pre-heated ThermoMixer C at 700 rpm and 37°C for 30 min.\nCritical: Optimize the tagmentation time for your cell type to ensure the best tagmentation outcome.\nAdd 0.5 μL 10% SDS, pipette to mix well, and incubate on ice for 5 min to stop the tagmentation reaction.\nUse the QIAGEN MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit to purify the tagmented DNA fragments following the manufacturer’s instruction (Protocol can be found HERE[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=8f6b09b2-6dcd-4b55-bb4a-255ede40ca3b&lang=en]).\nPause point: The purified DNA fragments can be stored at 4°C for up to 1 week or at −20°C for 4 weeks before PCR amplification.\nDNA fragments amplification\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nThe following steps in this part provide the step-by-step details to finish the ATAC-seq library construction.\nPrepare the PCR reaction to amplify the DNA fragments as follows.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3113_5.csv\nNote: ∗Primer sets were adopted from Ming et al. (2021).2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nRun PCR with the following setting in a thermocycler.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3113_6.csv\nNote: Annealing cycle number needs optimization for your input cell type and numbers.",
    "Pause point: At this point, the amplified DNA fragments can be stored at 4°C for 24 h or at −20°C for 1 week.\nAfter PCR amplification, add 55 μL (1.1×) AMPure XP beads, pipette to mix well, and transfer to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nNote: The AMPure XP beads are stored at 4°C and must be placed at 25°C for 30 min before use.\nIncubate on bench top for 5 min.\nPlace the tube on a magnetic stand for 5 min or until the liquid phase becomes clear.\nWhile the tube remains on the magnetic stand, carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting without disturbing the bead pellet.\nGently add 200 μL freshly made 80% ethanol without disturbing the bead pellet and incubate for 30 s.\nRemove ethanol and repeat steps 36–37 to wash the bead pellet twice in total.\nRemove residual ethanol with a pipette and air dry the bead pellet with the cap open for up to 5 min while the tube is on the magnetic stand.\nNote: DO NOT over-dry (the beads start to crack) the beads. Elute the DNA when the beads are still dark brown without visible liquid. Otherwise, the DNA yield will be lower.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand, add 25 μL TE buffer or nuclease-free H2O, and mix well by gentle pipetting.\nIncubate on bench top for 3 min.\nPlace the tube back on the magnetic stand for 5 min or until the liquid phase becomes clear.\nCarefully transfer 23 μL supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nAnalyze the DNA concentration and the size distribution with an Agilent TapeStation or a Bioanalyzer.\nNote: The DNA library can be further sequenced or stored at −80°C for up to 12 months.\nRNA-seq library construction\nTiming: 6–8 h",
    "This part is for extracting the total RNA from the sorted cells and constructing the RNA-seq library to be sequenced.\nThe RNA-seq libraries are constructed with a commercial RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN 217084, protocol can be found HERE[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=28d2f817-137d-4a60-a0f1-54a7408563bc&lang=en]) and an RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB E6420S, protocol can be found HERE[href=https://www.neb.com/en-us/-/media/nebus/files/manuals/manuale6420.pdf?rev=7731c29186c3494380bfbcec5e538827&hash=5D09336FE9DA6D68FBEABD91672FC682]) following the manufacturer’s instructions."
