It is impossible to distinguish these three different segments histologically; hence, note which segment you are working with.\nCut the segment of interest longitudinally along the length of the fragment at the mesenteric line.\nWith the luminal side facing upward and the serosa side flat on Whatman paper, gently blot excess PBS with a Kim wipe.",
    "Wrap the proximal end of SI around a toothpick and gently and loosely roll the intestine to form a Swiss-roll with the aid of curved forceps (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: The Swiss-roll technique is useful for scanning a large section of the small intestine and for quantitative assessment.\nNote: For a more detailed protocol demonstrating the Swiss-roll technique, please refer to Bialkowska et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nSlowly submerge the rolled small intestine into the cryo-mold containing the O.C.T compound until the toothpick touches the cryo-mold’s bottom.\nSlowly remove it by slowly pulling it up while holding down the tissue with small surgical forceps.\nCover the rest of the tissue with O.C.T..\nCritical: Avoid bubbles while adding O.C.T., especially around the tissue. If they occur, gently pop them with a toothpick.\nNote: Orientation of tissue in the block is important (the sectioning surface is at the bottom of the cryo-mold).\nHold the cryo-mold that contains the O.C.T. and the rolled tissue using large tongs/forceps.\nGently immerse ¾ of it into the container containing the cold isopentane. The freezing process should take about 30–60 s.\nNote: Be careful not to drop or not to submerge the samples fully; isopentane should not come in contact with the O.C.T. compound. Make sure the sample is fully frozen but ensure it does not crack.\nCritical: Tissues should be snap-frozen or placed in fixative within 5–10 min.\nNote: The faster you freeze the small intestine, the less chance of freezing (Swiss cheese holes) artifacts developing that can lead to crystal formation and tissue rupture; also, rapid freezing minimizes tissue desiccation.\nOnce the sample is frozen, tissue should be immediately stored in the foam container with dry ice until all the samples in the experiment are frozen.",
    "Pause point: Samples may be stored at −80°C until ready for sectioning and staining. Samples can be stored for up to 6 months without significant damage to the tissue integrity.\nWrap each frozen cryo-mold with the square pieces of aluminum foil.\nSeal in a zipper storage bag, removing any air.\nPlace in a cryogenic box at −80°C.\nCritical: Proper storage conditions include wrapping samples with foil, storing them in storage bags and removing the air. In addition, storing bagged samples in a cryogenic box will help preserve the tissue and prevent desiccation.\nTissue sectioning, staining, and mounting\nTiming: 2–4 days\nThese steps describe how to section frozen tissues, stain them with antibodies against the specific antigen of interest and the mounting of the slides for imaging.\nDay 1 focuses on sectioning and staining slides, and day 2 focuses on nuclear staining and mounting slides. This protocol may be used for fresh tissue freezing (snap-frozen technique) followed by freezing in O.C.T..\nDay 1:\nSet cryostat temperature between −20°C and −25°C.\nCritical: This is critical for fresh frozen tissue, temperature more than −16°C is not rigid enough to section.\nPlace samples for sectioning at −20°C freezer or inside the cryostat cooling chamber for 20–30 min for the tissue temperature to reach equilibrium.\nMount the tissue onto the cryostat specimen holder tissue “chuck”.\nAdd a drop of O.C.T to the chuck and adhere the tissue via the drop onto the cryostat chuck.\nFreeze using the Peltier option (rapid freeze) in the cooling chamber.\nSection SI (4–10 μm thickness) onto Superfrost™ Plus charged slides.",
    "Critical: The thickness of the tissue sections depends on the type of microscope used to visualize the staining. Conventional fluorescent microscopes (ex., Leica DM6000B fluorescent microscope) require the tissue to be under 10 μm, but for confocal microscopes,>10 μm thickness is preferred. Thicker sections can better preserve overall tissue architecture.\nImmediately after sectioning, place the slides in a Coplin jar containing −20°C cold histological grade, ≥99.5% acetone.\nFix and permeabilize for 7 min (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: Fixation time needs to be optimized depending on the thickness of the sections. Sections above 10 μm might require an increase in fixation time. Sections below 20 μm usually require under 10 min of fixation.\nAir dry slides for 30 min in a fume hood.\nRehydrate slides in a Coplin jar filled with 1× PBS for 10 min.\nCritical: Once slides are rehydrated, slides should be kept in a moist chamber.\nAspirate any PBS surrounding the tissue and place it in a moist chamber box.\nImmediately add the blocking buffer mixture (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nBlock for 1 h at (20°C and 25°C).\nWash off the blocking buffer with 1× PBS for 5 min each by placing the slides in Coplin jars.\nRepeat 3 times.\nAspirate any PBS surrounding the tissue and immediately add a pre-conjugated antibody.\nStore at 4°C in the dark overnight (∼12–16 h).\nDays 2–4:\nWash slides with 1× PBS for 5–10 min each by placing the slides in Coplin jars.\nRepeat 3 times.\nStain with nuclear stain Hoechst 33422 (10 μg/mL 1:1000) (or DAPI) for 30 min at (20°C and 25°C) in the dark.\nWash slides with 1× PBS for 5 min each by placing the slides in Coplin jars.\nRepeat 3 times.\nAspirate any PBS surrounding the tissue.\nAdd a drop of Prolong gold mounting media.",
    "Slowly mount with a cover slip.\nWipe any excess mounting media from the corners using a Kim wipe.\nAllow slides to harden/cure in the dark for 24–48 h before visualizing on a microscope.\nNote: Prolong gold is a hardening medium; it allows slides to be visualized months after staining. Other mounting mediums, such as Vector shield (wet mounting medium), may be used.\nImage acquisition\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section describes the steps to acquire images of the stained small intestine.\nPlace the slide on the stage.\nSet up the imaging parameters on the software.\nNote: This protocol used Hoechst 3342, AF488, AF647, and DIC filters.\nStart with a 10× dry objective in the suitable filter set for nuclear staining and focus using the z control on the microscope.\nOnce an area of interest is found, switch to 20× objective, focus, and acquire an image (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nPause point: Samples can be stored for at least 3 months at (20°C and 25°C) in the dark.\nMethodology of fixed tissue for fluorescent protein-expressing mice\nTiming: 3 days\nThese steps describe how to dissect the lungs from mice, fix, cryopreserve and freeze in O.C.T.\nNote: In this protocol, the lung is used as an example of chemical fixation. This protocol could be used for other tissue as well, but the time of fixation needs to be adjusted according to the thickness of the tissue being fixed.\nLung preparation and chemical fixation\nDay 1:\nDeeply sedate mice using Ketamine (80 mg/kg)/Xylazine (10 mg/mL) via the intraperitoneal route. Always make sure to sedate mice according to approved sedation procedures.\nPlace the mouse in the ventral position.\nGrasp the skin over the sternum and make an incision along the ventral midline from the groin to the chin.",
    "Grasp the peritoneal wall with forceps and make an incision to expose the gastrointestinal tract and chest cavity.\nMice are euthanized through induced bleeding by cutting into the abdominal aorta.\nUsing forceps, flip the small and large intestines to the right side.\nCut into the abdominal aorta to induce bleeding.\nMake an incision through the ventral diaphragm and cut the rib cage along the sternum to expose the lungs, trachea, heart, and esophagus.\nCarefully cut and remove the heart and esophagus.\nDissect the lung lobe of interest, or the whole pulmonary organ, trachea, and lung can be kept intact.\nImmerse each tissue individually immediately in 10 mL of fresh 1% PFA in 15 mL conical tubes.\nPlace on a nutator, rocking gently at 4°C.\nIncubate overnight (∼12–16 h) (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCritical: Fixation time should be optimized according to the tissue of interest. Fixation time is also dependent on the thickness of the tissue. Over-fixation leads to excess cross-linking of biomolecules preventing access to the antigen of interest and increasing background auto-fluorescence. The overnight timepoint mentioned in the protocol is optimized for a single lobe of the lung from 8–10 week-old female mice.\nNote: Inflation of the lung with PFA is not recommended for imaging lungs infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb). This will allow for proper identification of worm location within the lungs and their proximity to cells of interest.\nDay 2:\nPlace the lung tissues in 6-well plates filled with 1× PBS and place on a nutator, gently washing for 5 min.\nPlace the lung tissues in 6-well plates filled with 50 mM Ammonium chloride (NH4Cl).\nPlace on a nutator, gently washing for 5 min to quench free aldehydes.\nRepeat 3 times.\nPlace the lung tissues in 6-well plates filled with 1× PBS.",
    "Place on a nutator, gently washing for 5 min.\nCryoprotect the lungs by placing them in 30% (w/v) sucrose in a 15 mL conical vial and place on a nutator, rocking gently at 4°C (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nIncubate tissue overnight (∼12–16 h) at 4°C or longer until the tissue sinks.\nDay 3:\nPlace tissue on Whatman paper and gently blot to dry with a Kim wipe.\nPlace 1/3 O.C.T. filled cryo-mold on dry ice.\nOnce it starts freezing, add the lung on top of the almost frozen O.C.T.\nCompletely cover the tissue with O.C.T. and keep it on dry ice until it’s fully frozen.\nCritical: Avoid bubbles while adding O.C.T. if bubbles occur, you can gently pop them with a toothpick.\nNote: Orientation of tissue in the block is important (the sectioning surface is the bottom of the cryo-mold).\nOnce the sample is frozen, it can be stored in the foam container with dry ice until all the samples in the experiment are frozen.\nPause point: Samples may be stored at −80°C until ready for sectioning and staining.\nWrap each frozen cryo-mold with the square pieces of aluminum foil.\nSeal in a zipper storage bag removing any air.\nPlace in a cryogenic box at −80°C.\nCritical: Proper storage conditions that include wrapping samples with foil, storing them in storage bags, removing the air, and storing them in a cryogenic box will help preserve the tissue and prevent desiccation.\nTissue sectioning, staining, and mounting\nTiming: 2–4 days\nThis section describes how to section frozen tissues, stain them with antibodies against the specific antigen of interest and how to mount the slides for imaging.",
