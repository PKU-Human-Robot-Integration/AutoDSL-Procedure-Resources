    "1) Preparation\nTo begin, start up the NeuroStar system, log in, and perform the automated coil test.\nNext, access the appropriate patient file from the available list (all patients treated using the NeuroStar system are logged into the central computer)\nFinally, ensure the chair settings are not restrictive and lift the chair arm to make it easy for the patient to enter and sit down.\n2) Seating and Aligning the Patient\nWhen the patient arrives, seat him/her comfortably in the chair.\nMake sure both the patient and the technician insert ear plugs.\nUsing the adhesive strip, attach the head positioning strap just above the patient's eyebrows.  Make sure the central point is located above the nasion.\nRecline the chair and adjust the head support as needed.\nLightly attach the top head strap to the Velcro above the patient's nasion.\nActivate the laser and ensure it bisects the patient's nasion.\nAsk the subject to stare at a point on the wall and adjust the A/P bar until it is level with the eyeballs.\nEnsure the patient is fully centered and use the Velcro to secure the side head positioning straps to the treatment chair.\nLightly engage the side head pad to ensure cranial stability during motor threshold determination.\nFinally, record the head support system settings using the touch screen interface.\n3) Determine Motor Threshold\nTo determine motor threshold, move the coil down to the patient's head such that the coil is at the vertex and the SenStar tab is aligned above the top of the ear.\nMove the A/P bar forward until it aligns with the side of the coil.\nAlign the center line on the coil with the 0 degree mark on the coil angle indicator and move back the A/P bar.",
    "Once contact and position have been established, ask the subject to enact the  hitchhiker  position: arm bent 90 degrees at the elbow, fist held loosely, thumb extended outwards.\nBegin stimulation and focus on any movement of the thumb.\nGradually increase the MT level from 0.68 to 1.10 until thumb or concordant finger movement is seen.\nOnce movement is established, begin searching for the motor  hotspot.   Move the coil around in a grid like pattern, adjusting the MT level as needed.  Continue this search until you find a location and power level setting that elicits exactly 5 thumb twitches out of 10 consecutive pulses.\nOnce the motor  hotspot  has been determined, move the A/P bar forward until it, once again, aligns with the side of the coil.\nUse the touch screen interface to record the A/P position, Coil Angle, SOA position, and Power Level.\nFinally, press the  Found MT  button.  We are now ready for treatment.\n4) Patient Treatment\nTo begin, move the coil 5.5 cm anterior to the MT location.  This will be the treatment location.\nEnsure the coil is making contact with the patient's head and ask the patient to remain still for the duration of the treatment.\nThe treatment parameters are preloaded into the device.  Stimulation will be generated at 120% motor threshold with a pulse sequence of 10 Hz for 4 seconds, followed by a 26 second quiet period.  Treatment will last for a total of 37.5 minutes   this is a total of 3,000 pulses.\nPress the  Confirm Pulse Sequence  button then press the  Start  button.\nDuring treatment, remain in the room with the patient and periodically check to ensure the coil is making contact with the patient.",
    "After the pulse sequence is completed, move the coil up and away from the patient's head and move away the side head support pad.\nRaise the back of the chair and raise the arm of the chair.\nAssist the patient as he/she stands up.\nRemove ear plugs and touch the  Logout  button to end the treatment session.\n5) Representative Results\nTMS is typically applied daily for a period of 4-6 weeks.  Recent data suggests some patients may be prone to symptomatic relapse after 4-6 months.8  If this occurs, practitioners may want to consider maintenance sessions to prolong effect. This treatment has been effective in approximately 60% of the patients treated.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2345/2345fig1.jpg"
