    "Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 400 - 450 g) were used in the experiment. All surgical and experimental procedures followed the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The procedures were approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n1. Electrode Implantation\nAnesthetize the rat in a chamber with 5% isoflurane and an air flow rate of 1 L/min before the surgery.\nUsing a stereotaxic apparatus, fix the head of the rat with its nose placed into the anesthetic mask. Administrate isoflurane via the anesthetic mask at a concentration of 2% with an air flow rate of 0.5 L/min to maintain the anesthetic depth during the surgery. Note that the surgical tolerance is achieved when the rat fails to respond to toe-pinching.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to avoid corneal drying.\nShave the top of the rat scalp using a standard shaver.\nSterilize the scalp using the medical iodophor disinfectant solution and 75% alcohol to remove the iodine.\nInject lidocaine (2%) into the scalp for local analgesia. Administer atropine (0.2 mL i.p.) to inhibit respiratory hypersecretion.\nMake a midline incision of approximately 2 - 3 cm on the scalp using a scalpel. Cut and remove part of the scalp along the midline and expose the cranium. Use the electrocoagulator to stop the bleeding, when necessary.\nMark the locations of ECoG electrodes based on the predefined stereotaxic coordinates (placed according to the position of Bregma) and the locations of the reference and ground electrodes on the midline (placed 2 and 4 mm caudally to the Lambda, respectively).\nDrill holes (diameter: 0.5 mm) for the ECoG screws, using an electric cranial drill on the skull at the marked sites, without destroying the dura.",
    "Drive a stainless-steel screw (outside diameter: 0.6 mm), which connects to the insulation-coated copper wire, into the hole for approximately 1 mm depth without penetrating the underlying dura. These screws act as ECoG, reference, and ground electrodes during the experiment.\nPlace a protective shell base on the cranium. Fix the base with its adjacent screws on the cranium using dental acrylic. Use medical cotton that could be removed afterward to protect the area that is intended to be used for depth wire implantation from being covered.\n\tNOTE: The protective shell is a custom-designed 3D-printed polylactic product, which consists of three parts: a base, a wall, and a cap. The wall is covered by copper tapers to construct as a Faraday cage.\nMark the locations of the depth wire electrodes based on the predefined stereotaxic coordinates.\nDrill small holes (diameter: 0.2 mm) on the skull around the marked sites for wire implantation, and carefully remove the bone flap to expose the dura. Wash the craniotomy frequently, using normal saline. Figure 1 describes the set-up before the implantation of the depth wire electrodes.\nUsing a needle, lift and cut the dura without damaging the pia mater, vessels, and the surface of the neocortex.\nLower the depth wire electrodes to the surface of the neocortex and, then, slowly penetrate the brain to the target depth. Frequently stop moving down the electrodes for cortical resilience. In the present study, the depth of the wire tip is 0.5 mm under the cortical surface.\nSeal the craniotomy with a mixture of wax and paraffin oil to ensure that the depth wire electrodes can be moved for subsequent experimental manipulations.\nFix the electrode apparatus using dental acrylic on the skull.",
    "Weld each copper wire that connects to the ECoG screw to the corresponding channel on the connector module. Cover the welding spots using clay to avoid potential contact between different channels.\nAssemble the protective shell wall to the base and weld the reference and ground electrodes to the corresponding channels.\nFix the cap to the protective shell using tapes to avoid contamination.\nInject the rat with penicillin (60,000 U, i.p.) immediately after surgery to prevent postsurgical infections.\nSingle-house the rat in a temperature- and humidity-controlled cage and keep it in a 12-h day/night cycle after the surgery, with food and water ad libitum for at least one week prior to the LEP experiment.\n\tNOTE: To simultaneously record ECoG and cortical LFP activities, an apparatus was used here that was assembled with two types of electrodes linked to a connector module, which contained several microdrives attached to the tungsten wire arrays. The gold pins were used to connect the tungsten wires to the electrode interface board (EIB) of the connector module by pressing the wires into small metal holes on the EIB. Two metal holes on the EIB were soldered with coated copper wires, and the open end of each copper wire was soldered with the corresponding copper wire connected to ECoG screw. The details of fabrication have been described elsewhere21.\n2. Data Collection\nTickle the rat at least 1x a day for three or more consecutive days before the experiment to ensure that the rat gets familiar with the experimenter22.\nPlace the rat in the behavior chamber for at least 1 h before the experiment to ensure the rat acclimatizes to the recording environment.",
    "NOTE: The chamber is a plastic cube with a side length of 30 cm. The bottom of the chamber is made of an iron grating with ~8 mm gaps.\nConnect the recording headstage with the electrode module gently, to avoid scaring the rat and damaging the electrode module.\nSet up the laser generator, connect the optic fiber, and adjust the spot size of the laser according to the equipment operator’s manual. Connect the digital output from the trigger generator to the digital input port of the recording board.\n\tNOTE: Take care not to curl the optic fiber excessively to avoid breaking off the fiber. Before recording, make sure the trigger signals are displayed and recorded by the recording software. In this protocol, radiant-heat stimuli are generated by an infrared neodymium yttrium aluminum perovskite (Nd: YAP) laser with a wavelength of 1.34 μm. The diameter of the laser spot size is set at approximately 5 mm by focusing lenses. A He-Ne laser pointed to the stimulated area, which is defined depending on the objective of the experiment. Also, the stimulus energy of the laser pulses is determined according to the experimental design. The laser pulse duration is 4 ms.\nSet the video camera beneath the corner of the experimental chamber to continuously record the nociceptive behaviors of the rat when its paw receives nociceptive laser stimuli. Adjust the position and direction of the camera to make sure the nociceptive behaviors are completely recorded throughout the experiment.",
    "NOTE: A high-speed charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is highly recommended, as it can deliver the operating signals to the main board of the recording system to record the onset time and duration of the nociceptive behavior precisely. Nociceptive behaviors are assessed by the experimenter after each laser stimulus, according to previously defined criteria based on the animal movement23,24, as follows: no movement (score = 0), head-turning (including shaking or elevating the head; score = 1), flinching (i.e., a small abrupt body jerking movement; score = 2), withdrawal (i.e., paw retraction from the laser stimulus; score = 3), licking and whole-body movement (score = 4).\nDeliver ongoing white noise (50 dB SPL) via a loudspeaker at the top of the chamber.\n\tNOTE: As shown in previous studies10,25, laser stimulation delivered on the skin generates ultrasounds that can be detected by the rat auditory system. For this reason, ongoing white noise is played throughout the experiment to avoid the activation of the auditory system in response to laser-generated ultrasounds. This procedure allows the selective recording of brain responses related to the activation of the nociceptive system.\nCollect the electrophysiological data from both the ECoG and the depth wire electrodes, using the recording system according to the equipment operator’s manual.\n\tNOTE: The operating signals of the camera and the trigger signals of the laser pulses are sampled simultaneously with the electrophysiological data at the same sampling rate (all data are amplified and digitized using a sampling rate of 20,000 Hz), which ensures that all data are time-synchronized.\nDeliver the laser pulses to the plantar of the rat’s forepaw through the gaps in the bottom of the chamber.",
    "NOTE: The laser stimulus is only delivered when the rat is spontaneous stillness for more than 2 s based on the experimenter’s observation, to minimize the signal contamination of the movement-related artifacts. To avoid nociceptor fatigue or sensitization, the target of the laser beam is displaced manually after each stimulus, and the interstimulus interval is never shorter than 40 s. ECoG and LFP signals can be recorded several times from each rat. The rat needs to be put in the experimental chamber 1 h before each recording session. After all recording sessions, the rat was deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain was removed from the skull and sectioned to identify the electrode positions.\n3. Data Analysis\nFilter the continuous data with a band-pass filter between 1 and 30 Hz.\nEpoch the data using an analysis window of 3 s, extended from 1 s before to 2 s after the onset of laser stimuli. Baseline correction is performed by subtracting the mean amplitude within the prestimulus interval.\nManually reject the epochs that are contaminated by gross artifacts.\nCompute the averaged LEP waveforms that are time-locked to the onset of laser stimuli for each experimental condition.\nCompute the wavelet transform coherence (WTC) of LEP waveforms recorded from ECoGs and depth wire electrodes.\n\tNOTE: WTC is a technique to perform the coherence between pairs of electrodes as a function of time and frequency. The WTC between two signals can be calculated for any time-frequency point, which has the advantage of generating coherence values for the entire time-frequency spectrum. The details of the methodology have been described elsewhere26.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
