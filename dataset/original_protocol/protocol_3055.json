    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCollection of footpads\nTiming: 15 min (time varies depending on the number of mice)\nNote: All steps should be performed in the biosafety cabinet.\nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane.\nSacrifice mice by cervical dislocation.\nCut foot above the ankle (just below the calf muscle) and remove skin (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2800-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation of single cells from mouse footpad\n(A) Mouse footpads collected in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.\n(B) Remove skin from footpads.\n(C) Transfer deskinned footpad in 15 mL conical tube containing digestion media.\n(D) Filter dissociated tissues through 70 μM cell strainer.\n(E) Leukocyte isolation using Mono-Poly medium.\n(F) Leukocyte purification using CD45 positive selection kit.\n(G) Isolated footpad immune cells.\nTissue processing\nTiming: 2:30 h\nAliquot 5 mL freshly prepared digestion media into a 15 mL conical tube containing glass beads and wrap parafilm outside of cap to avoid leakage (5 footpads in a single 15 mL tube, each foot pad cut into 3 pieces, 5 glass beads/tube).\nOptional: Add SUPERase·In (4 units per mL) to block RNase activity if preparing samples for scRNA-seq.\nNote: We have added glass beads to promote physical disruption of footpad tissues.\nShake vigorously for 2 h at 37°C in a benchtop shaker (>180 rpm).\nNote: Manual shaking can be performed every 15 min if a shaker is not available.\nPass tissue digests through a 70 μm cell strainer by pouring mixture from the 15 mL conical tube directly onto the strainer fitted in a 50 mL tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: The foot will still be relatively intact, but cells have been digested out of the tissue.\nWash strainer with 10 mL cold 10% RPMI-1640 media.\nPellet cells by centrifugation (400 × g, 5 min, 4°C) and remove supernatant.",
    "Resuspend cell pellet into 3 mL 10% RPMI-1640 media (this media should be at room temperature, because we will isolate cells by using a mono-poly medium).\nProtocol for footpad leukocyte isolation using mono-poly medium\nTiming: 45 min\nImmediately before use, mix mono-poly medium (M-P M) well by inverting at least 3–5 times and add 3 mL M-P M to a sterile 15 mL conical tube.\nCarefully layer 3 mL footpad cell solution onto the M-P M (Place tube at a slight vertical angle and slowly add media containing cells).\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 30 min in a swinging bucket rotor at room temperature (20°C–25°C) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: Set the centrifuge machine brake at zero.\nCollect cell layers between RPMI-1640 media and M-P M to isolate mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells and add to a 15 mL conical tube containing 10 mL cold FACS buffer. There will be a thick layer at the RPMI-1640 and M-P M interface. The second layer is often small or not visible. The first layer mostly contains mononuclear cells, while the second layer contains polymorphonuclear cells.\nNote: For CD45 positive selection, FACS buffer should be supplemented with 2 mM EDTA.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nResuspend in 1 mL FACS buffer.\nFor scRNA-seq, proceed for CD45 purification.\nFor flow cytometry, wash cells with FACS buffer, perform cell counting and proceed with staining in V bottom 96 well plate.\nCD45 positive selection for leukocyte purification\nTiming: 45 min",
    "Note: We have performed CD45 based selection because we had many samples, and it was more convenient to all samples at a time with this kit to maintain higher viability of the isolated cells. But users can choose other purification methods such as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) depending on sample size, the required number of cells and viability percentage.\nAdd sample to a 5 mL (12 × 75 mm) polystyrene round-bottom tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F)\nPrepare Selection Cocktail from EasySep Mouse CD45 Positive Selection Kit. For each 1 mL sample, prepare 100 μL of cocktail (50 μL of component A + 50 μL of component B).\nNote: Selection Cocktail must be prepared fresh before each use.\nAdd Selection Cocktail to sample. 100 μL/mL of sample, mix with pipette and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nTake out Vortex RapidSpheres™ from EasySep Mouse CD45 Positive Selection Kit and vortex for 30 s.\nNote: Particles should appear evenly dispersed.\nAdd 50 μL of RapidSpheres™ per 1 mL of sample, mix with pipette and incubate at room temperature for 3 min.\nAdd 2.5 mL FACS buffer to the tube. Mix by gently pipetting up and down 2–3 times. Place the tube (without lid) onto the magnet and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nPick up the magnet, and in one continuous motion invert the magnet and tube into a waste container. Leave the magnet and tube inverted for 2–3 s, then return upright. Do not shake or blot off any drops that may remain hanging at the lip of the tube while pouring off the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 19 and 20 three more times. During each separation period, cells need to be in 2.5 mL FACS buffer in the upright position for 5-min (total of 4 × 5-min separations).",
    "Remove the tube from the magnet; this tube contains the isolated cells.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL FACS buffer. Make sure to collect cells from the sides of the tube.\nIsolated cells are ready to use for scRNA-seq. We can process these cells directly for single cell barcoding, library preparation and sequencing. In addition, we can fix these cells to store at −80°C and process later for scRNA-seq.\nIn the present study, we fixed cells using the Parse fixation kit and preserved them at −80°C. Then we sent samples on dry ice from Virginia Tech to the University of Michigan for library preparation and sequencing. We followed the standard fixation protocol provided by Parse biosciences with some minor modifications such as: increased centrifuge speed from 200 × g to 400 × g and resuspended cell pellet by flicking after removing the supernatant but before adding cell buffer; this will result in better resuspension of the pellet after step 28 www.parsebiosciences.com/products/evercode-whole-transcriptome[href=http://www.parsebiosciences.com/products/evercode-whole-transcriptome].\nPreparation of cells for scRNA-seq\nTiming: 10 min\nCell counting: Take 10 μL suspended cells + 10 μL 0.4% trypan blue, mix and use microscope or automated cell counter to count cells and determine viability percentage.\nNote: We recommend use of manual cell counting for scRNA-seq as we found it to be more consistent (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPrepare the following items before starting the cell fixation:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2800-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Immune cells isolated from mouse footpads and fixed with Evercode cell fixation V2 kit (images were taken with 10X lens)\n(A) Freshly isolated immune cells.\n(B) Fixed immune cells.\n(C) Fixed cells at 48-h post fixation.\nCoat 15 mL conical tubes with 1% BSA.\nNote: Each sample will require one additional 15 mL conical tube during the fixation workflow.\nMake 1% BSA solution in sterile water.",
    "Add 15 mL 1% BSA solution to each tube.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nPour BSA out of the tubes and use a P1000 pipette to remove the remaining BSA in the bottom of the tube.\nAir dry for 30 min with the uncapped tubes in the biosafety cabinet.\nProceed to fixation or store capped BSA coated tubes at 4°C for up to 4 weeks.\nNote: We recommend preparing these tubes in advance.\nFill ice in a bucket large enough to hold all samples and reagents.\nBring your swinging-bucket centrifuge to 4°C.\nPrepare 10% w/v BSA in PBS according to samples (50 μL required for one sample); this will be used to prepare cell buffer for use in step 28.\nTo store fixed samples at −80°C, take out a “Mr. Frosty” or similar device which enables cooling of a sample at around −1°C/min. Ensure it is at room temperature.\nNote: Only proceed if you have taken out items listed in step 25. All items that require thawing should be fully thawed before starting this section. It is important that all fixation kit solutions (except DMSO) are kept on ice after thawing.\nCell fixation\nTiming: 50 min\nTransfer up to 4 million cells into a BSA coated 15 mL conical tube.\nNote: No more than 4 million cells should be used for any single sample. Starting with more cells may result in elevated doublet rates. A fixed volume is not required for this step; however, it should fit into a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge tubes in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 4°C for 400 × g for 10 min.",
    "Note: During centrifugation, prepare 1 mL of cell buffer (provided in Evercode cell fixation V2 kit) containing 0.5% BSA per sample. Do not add BSA directly to the cell buffer tube as you will need a cell buffer without BSA for later use. Prepare cell buffer + BSA in a separate tube and keep the original tube on ice.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and fully resuspend pellet in 750 μL of cold cell buffer containing 0.5% BSA.\nNote: Resuspend pellet by flicking after removing the supernatant but before adding cell buffer; this will result in better resuspension of the pellet. Failure to fully resuspend cells may lead to elevated doublet rates.\nPipette cells through a 40 μM strainer (provided with Evercode cell fixation V2 kit) into a new 15 mL conical tube. Place cells back on ice.\nNote: To ensure that all the liquid passes through the strainer, gently press the tip of the pipette against the filter and press the pipette plunger down steadily. All the liquid should pass through the strainer in ∼1 second.\nAdd 250 μL of cold fixation solution and mix immediately by pipetting up and down exactly 3 times (with the pipette still set to 250 μL).\nNote: Do not perform additional mixing at this step.\nWait 10 min with cells on ice.\nAdd 80 μL of cold permeabilization solution provided with Evercode cell fixation V2 kit. Mix by pipetting up and down 3 times with a P1000 set to 250 μL. Wait 3 min with cells on ice.\nNote: Do not vortex the neutralization buffer provided with Evercode cell fixation V2 kit. To mix, invert the tube five times.\nAdd 4 mL of cold neutralization buffer and gently invert the tube once to mix. Place cells back on ice.",
    "Centrifuge tube in swinging bucket centrifuge at 4°C set to 400 × g for 10 min. Aspirate and discard the supernatant using a P1000 pipette.\nResuspend cells in cell buffer using a P1000 pipette and place back on ice. If you started with more than 500,000 cells, resuspend in 300 μL of cell buffer without BSA. If you started with fewer than 500,000 cells, resuspend in 150 μL of cell buffer without BSA.\nPass cells through a 40 μM strainer into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with a P1000. Keep samples on ice.\nNote: These Eppendorf tubes should be properly labeled with key identifying information such as experiment number, pathogen and tissue name, date of collection, researcher initials, etc.\nAdd DMSO to samples as follows:\nIf you started with more than 500,000 cells, add 5 μL of DMSO. If you started with fewer than 500,000 cells, add 2.5 μL of DMSO. Gently flick the tube 3 times to mix and wait 1 min with samples on ice.\nRepeat the previous step two more times to add a total of 15 μL of DMSO if you started with more than 500,000 cells, or 7.5 μL of DMSO if you started with fewer than 500,000 cells.\nMix the final suspension by gently pipetting up and down five times with a P200 to ensure that the DMSO is well mixed. To avoid creating bubbles, set the P200 to 150 μL if you started with more than 500,000 cells, or 75 μL if you started with fewer than 500,000 cells.",
    "Note: Do not vortex cells. At this step, we can split cells into aliquots in Eppendorf tubes before freezing if the cells will be run in multiple barcoding experiments. Place tubes containing cells into a Mr. Frosty (or similar device which enables cooling at around −1°C/min) and place into a −80°C freezer.\nAfter fixation, cell counting was performed, and cell morphology was evaluated by microscopy (10X magnification) as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. At 48 h post fixation, we again performed cell counting and took images to assess thawing effect on cells.\nWe loaded 8333 fixed footpad cells from each sample for three rounds of barcoding followed by lysis to isolate barcoded cDNA and prepare sub libraries. These sub libraries were sequenced and generated 30–60 thousand reads from each cell according to the standard Parse Biosciences scRNA-seq protocol www.parsebiosciences.com/products/evercode-whole-transcriptome[href=http://www.parsebiosciences.com/products/evercode-whole-transcriptome] and the detected cell clusters from mock-infected and MAYV-infected mice footpad cells are presented in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2800-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. scRNA-seq from mouse footpad cells\n(A) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of the identified cell clusters from mock infected animals footpad cells at 7dpi.\n(B) UMAP plot of MAYV infected animals footpad cells at 7 dpi.\nNote: We used Parse Biosciences kits, but users can choose other platforms depending on sample size, the required sequencing depth, and the budget.\nWe have also performed flow cytometry from the isolated footpad cells to assess immune cell infiltration in MAYV-infected mice; data is presented in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2800-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Timing: 2 h\nTransfer up to 1 × 106 cells from each sample into a V bottom 96 well plate.\nPellet cells by centrifuging at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant. Again, wash cells with 200 μL PBS.\nDilute Zombie aqua dye at 1:400 in PBS. Resuspend cells in diluted 100 μL Zombie aqua solution.\nNote: Don’t use Tris buffer as a diluent and be sure that the PBS does not contain any other protein like BSA or FBS.\nIncubate the cells at room temperature, in the dark, for 30 min.\nAdd 100 μL FACS buffer, pellet cells by centrifuging at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL Fc antibody solution (1 μg per one million cells) and incubate for 15 min on ice. Keep one sample as an unstained control.\nPrepare combined antibody solution for each sample. Here, we prepared two antibody cocktails: one for gating innate immune cells (CD45 0.125 μg, CD11b 0.125 μg, Ly6G 0.06 μg, Ly6C 0.06 μg) and other for gating adaptive immune cells (CD45 0.125 μg, CD3 0.25 μg, CD4 0.25 μg, CD8a 0.50 μg). We used UltraComp eBeads compensation beads as a single-color control for each antibody to achieve reliable and robust positive and negative populations for the fluorochromes listed in separate panels.\nAdd 100 μL FACS buffer containing antibodies to each sample, resuspend cells and incubate on ice for 30 min in dark.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL FACS buffer, pellet cells by centrifuging at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nAgain, wash cells with 200 μL FACS buffer.",
    "Resuspend cells in 200 μL 4% formalin and incubate for 30 min at room temperature in dark.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.\nWash cells twice with 200 μL FACS buffer.\nResuspend cells in 200 μL PBS, cover plate in aluminum foil and proceed to analyze cells using a flow cytometer equipped with the necessary lasers and detectors. We captured 100,000 cells/events for each sample."
