    "DCs depletion in B6.CD11c-DTR miceInject B6.CD11c-DTR mice (6-8 weeks age) i.p. with 2 ng/g of body weight of DTx (200 μl volume per mouse), or with PBS as depletion control (200 μl volume per mouse), using a syringe with 25 gauge needle.24 h after injection, mice are euthanized with halothane by inhalation (or other approved euthanasia protocol).The spleens are removed and processed in a cell strainer inside a sterile culture hood (with 5 ml of supplemented RPMI 1640), followed by two washes with RPMI (at 300 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).Splenocytes are then stained with mAbs (0.5 µl per 106 cells – each mAb at initial 0.5 mg/ml concentration, diluted in 25 µl of Staining Buffer) to CD11c and I-Ab (1 incubation period of 30 min), re-suspended in staining buffer (200 µl) and analyzed in a FACSCanto device, to evaluate depletion efficiency.MZMΦs depletion in B6 mice with ClLipInject B6 mice (6-8 weeks age) i.v. with 8.5 µg/g of body weight of ClLip (200 µl per mice) prepared as described in (van Rooijen et al., 1993), or with PBS-loaded liposomes (200 µl per mice, 8.5 µg/g of body weight) as depletion control, using a syringe with 30 gauge needle.24 h to seven days after injection, mice are euthanized with halothane by inhalation (or other approved euthanasia protocol) and bled by cardiac puncture with a 1 ml syringe with a 25 gauge needle.Note: In both time points only MZMΦs are depleted in our protocol (this was done as a control to ensure only MZMΦs are depleted in our protocol, opposite to injection of higher concentrations of ClLip).",
    "The spleens are removed and processed in a cell strainer inside a sterile culture hood (with 5 ml of supplemented RPMI 1640), followed by two washes with RPMI (at 300 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).Splenocytes are then stained with mAbs (0.5 µl per 106 cells – each mAb at initial 0.5 mg/ml concentration, diluted in 25 µl of Staining Buffer) to MARCO, MOMA-1, CD11b, CD11c and I-Ab (1 incubation period of 30 min), re-suspended in Staining Buffer (200 µl) and analyzed in a FACSCanto device, to evaluate depletion efficiency. An example of results obtained with this experiment is shown in Figure 1A and 1B, respectively.Note: Different DC subsets might have different sensitivity to DTx treatment, with different repopulation rates following initial depletion. Thus, for prolonged experiments, an important step would be to perform repopulation rate assays for the DCs subsets of interest.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160727/20160727203457_2884.jpgFigure 1. In vivo depletion of splenic DCs and MZMΦs. A. Representative plots of mice depleted of DCs using as controls of depletion B6 mice treated with DTX (here, CD11c-DTR mice treated with DTx present with a lower percentage of CD11c+I-A+ DCs, as showed in the gate in the upper right of each histogram (this decrease in percentage is an indicative of cell depletion).

Representative plots of mice depleted of MZMΦs using as controls B6 mice treated with ClLip (here, ClLip-treated mice present with a lower percentage of MARCO+MOMA-1+ MZMΦs, as showed in the gates represented in each histogram (this decrease in percentage is an indicative of cell depletion).
