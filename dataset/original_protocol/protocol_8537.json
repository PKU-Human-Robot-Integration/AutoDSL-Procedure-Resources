    "1. Preparation of Reagents and Equipment\nPrepare 1x Dissection Buffer (70 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.02 mM CaCl2, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, 115 mM sucrose, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES; pH 7.2).\nPrepare 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS).\nPrepare 1x PBT using 1x PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100.\nPrepare fruit juice agar plates.14 Briefly, mix 30 g agar in 700 mL of H2O and autoclave. Dissolve 0.5 g of methyl paraben in 10 mL of ethanol and add solution to 300 mL of fruit juice concentrate (grape or apple). Mix concentrate into autoclaved agar solution and pour into the lids of 10 mm x 35 mm Petri dishes.\n\tNOTE: Grape agar power premix can also be purchased from various companies (see Tabls of Materials).\nObtain size 5 forceps that allow one to mechanically injure the larvae.\nUse standard Drosophila CO2 based anesthesia apparatus.\n2. Selecting Drosophila  Larvae\nTake a vial or bottle of Drosophila containing wandering third instar larvae that have been cultured at 25 °C.\nSelect ten individual 2nd or 3rd instar larvae based on appearance. Third instar larvae can be identified by the appearance of anterior branched spiracles, while second instar larvae are smaller and have more club-like anterior spiracles.\n\tNOTE: Larval stages can also be identified by timing. At 25 °C, second instar larvae appear approximately 48 h after hatching, and third instar larvae molt approximately 24 h later. If interested in examining neurodegeneration at the NMJ, second instar larvae need to be injured.\n3. Preparing Drosophila Larvae for Mechanical Injury\nCarefully pick individual larvae up by forceps or a paintbrush, being cautious not to compress it in anyway.\nDirectly place ten larvae into glass dish containing cold 1X PBS or dissection buffer to remove any food debris and to decelerate larval motility.",
    "4. Mechanical Injury and Treatment of Drosophila Larvae\nPlace each individual larva onto a CO2 anesthetizing apparatus.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, carefully roll each larva onto their dorsal side in order to visualize the segmental nerves through the cuticle.\nPosition size 5 forceps approximately 1/2 to 2/3 way down the length of the larva starting at the mouth hooks. Once positioned, pinch approximately 1/3 of the ventral cuticle containing the segmental nerves with size 5 forceps.\nTo ensure that larval segmental nerves are injured, apply sufficient force to crush the segmental nerves but leave the cuticle intact. To determine the correct amount of force, crush 10 larvae and ensure the death rate after 5 h is under 50%.\nAfter injury, carefully transfer larvae to a fruit juice agar plate containing approximately 0.5 g of yeast paste. Place each larva so its anterior end is on the yeast paste, for continued feeding despite disrupted motility.\n\tNOTE: To ensure that larval segmental nerves have been injured, disrupted larval motility can be observed after transfer to the agar plate. Injured larva are effectively paralyzed posterior to the site of injury, but can still move their mouth hooks and feed. A high death rate of animals after injury is common so it is best to injure 20-50% more animals than is necessary for an experiment.\nPlace agar plates containing yeast paste and 10 injured larvae into the bottom of an empty 100 x 15 mm petri dish. Cover this petri plate, now containing the injured larvae on an agar plate with a moist paper towel, ensuring that the paper towel does not touch the larvae or the agar plates. Place this Petri dish into a larger air-tight container, at RT.\nRetrieve larvae for dissection after specified periods (6, 12, or 24 h) post-injury.",
    "NOTE: To examine immediate effects of injury on the axonal cytoskeleton, larvae can be dissected directly after injury. To examine axonal transport defects, larvae can be dissected approximately 6 h after injury. About 12 h after injury a build-up of ubiquitinated proteins can be observed, and 24 h after injury, degeneration of motor neurons at the NMJ can be observed.\n5. Analysis of Neurodegeneration at the NMJ\nDissect Drosophila larval NMJ as described previously.15,16 Briefly, pin larvae onto a Sylgard plate, cut along the dorsal surface, and fillet with pins in a drop of dissection buffer to expose the body wall musculature. Fix larvae in either 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or Bouin's Solution depending on the antibodies used to visualize neurons and muscle.\n\tNOTE: PFA fixation should be used if fluorescent protein tags, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is to be visualized as Bouin's fixative can be too harsh.\nPerform immunofluorescence, which has been described previously11,13,16, to simultaneously mark presynaptic motor neurons and adjacent postsynaptic (SSR) muscle folds. Visualize presynaptic membranes and axons with fluorescently conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:300)17 and active zones can be stained using an anti-Bruchpilot (Brp) antibody (nc82; 1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Simultaneously label post-synaptic muscles with an anti-Dics Large (Dlg) antibody (1:10,000).18\nPerform an established assay for quantifying neurodegeneration at the NMJ as described previously.8,9,10,11,12,13,14 Briefly, simultaneously visualize individual NMJs for both pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Any boutons labeled with postsynaptic markers but not presynaptic markers indicate sites of neurodegeneration (Figure 1). The average number of boutons per NMJ as well as the average number of NMJs per animal can be quantified.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
