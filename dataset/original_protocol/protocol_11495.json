    "Ethics Statement: This study was approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Animal Care and Use Committee. All investigators taking part in animal handling and measurement of study outcomes were properly trained by the NIH Office of Animal Care and Use and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Murine Phenotyping Core. All aspects of animal testing, housing, and environmental conditions used in this study were in compliance with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals11.\n1. Housing and Experimental Animals\nNOTE: House male C57BL/6 mice (roughly five weeks old upon arrival) individually throughout the experiment and provide ad libitum access to food and water. All cages are kept on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle with the light phase beginning at 6 am and dark phase at 6 pm.\nIdentify the mice and assign them to individual standard ventilated mouse cages. Allow 24 h after the identification procedure for recovery.\n\tNOTE: Tail tattoo is recommended as a means of identification to eliminate the possibility that an ear tag could get caught in a running wheel. Tattoo a number on the tail of each mouse, with the number on the tail matching the number written on the mouse's cage.\nAllow mice to acclimate to their cages for at least three more days, handling each mouse gently for a period of three minutes per day.\n2. Running Wheel Acclimation and Baseline\nIntroduce the mice to individual VWRA cages, each equipped with a running wheel connected to an electronic counter for continuous recording.",
    "NOTE: All wheel counters connect to a computer through a single USB interface (see Materials List). The computer software calculates the number of wheel rotations, distance traveled, and average speed across each designated time interval of the specified total duration. Once the recording stops, the data are automatically saved both as text and as spreadsheets.\nInitiate recording of VWRA through the computer software interface. Set recording intervals to one hour and the duration to at least five days. Continue recording VWRA for at least five days.\n\tNOTE: At the end of step 2.2, all mice should achieve a relatively consistent amount of daily wheel running activity. If not, then identify and exclude any outliers.\nStop VWRA recording through the software interface, and return the mice to their standard cages described in step 1.1 (cages without running wheels).\nRandomize mice into either sham-irradiated control or irradiated groups.\n3. Irradiation\nNote: Perform the following steps for all mice in both groups, once per day for three sequential days. Treat mice in the same order each day.\nAnesthetize each mouse by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) mixture.\nConfirm anesthesia with a toe pinch and use ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nTransfer the anesthetized mouse into a lead shielding device. Arrange the mouse in the shielding so that only the lower abdominal/pelvic region is exposed.\n\tNOTE: The shielding is composed of two lead \"boxes,\" with a narrow open space in between that allows radiation exposure to a small, targeted region of the mouse (see Figure 1).\nUse medical tape to secure the base of the mouse's tail in position within the shielding.",
    "NOTE: Step 3.4 is optional, but doing so can help ensure that the position of the mouse does not change during the following step.\nTransport the shielding device into the irradiator, ensuring that the animal position within the shielding is maintained.\nIf the mouse is in the irradiation group, deliver 800 cGy at a dose rate of about 110 cGy/min. If the mouse is in the sham-irradiation control group, leave the mouse in the inactive irradiator for the equivalent time.\n\tNOTE: Optimal irradiator settings will depend on the particular device. The dose rate of 110 cGy/min delivered from a 137Cesium source is the central dose rate of the irradiator used here. The exposure time was adjusted to reach the desired total dose of 800 cGy.\nRemove the mouse from the irradiator and shielding, and then return it to its original, standard cage mentioned in step 1.1.\nContinuously monitor the mouse until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n4. Radiation-induced Fatigue Measurement\nOn the day after completion of three successive days of irradiation, transfer the mice to their individual VWRA cages described in step 2.1.\nRecord VWRA, as described in step 2.2, except here setting the recording duration to more than 15 days. At the end of the 15 days, manually stop VWRA recording through the software interface.\n\tNOTE: The data from each recording period are automatically saved as spreadsheets, each of which includes the rotation, distance, and speed measurements for all animals (columns) and at all intervals (rows) throughout the duration of recording. At the end of the experiment, there are two spreadsheets generated by the recording software: one for the pre-irradiation VWRA, and one for the post-irradiation VWRA.\nSubscription Required.
