    "The protocol illustrated here follows the guidelines of the human research ethics committee at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n1. Preoperative Protocol\nAssess patients with spinal pathology in clinic and determine eligibility for spinal surgery. Perform neurological assessment and obtain CT or MRI scan to identify spinal lesion.\nInclude patients who have an intradural pathology such as schwannoma, ependymoma, meningioma, astrocytoma, etc.; or patients who have a ventral compressive extradural pathology, such as a ventral thoracic herniated disc, fracture fragments ventrally, or a spinal bony tumor with ventral compression.\n\tNOTE: Pathology is determined by spinal imaging with CT or MRI. Exclusion criteria includes the patients who cannot tolerate surgery, or patients with an extremely poor prognosis.\n2. Preparation for Surgery\nDo not allow the patient to consume anything by mouth after the midnight before surgery.\n\tNOTE: The patient will be placed under general anesthesia and intubated by the anesthesiologist.\nPosition patient with their back exposed according to surgeon's preference for the spinal surgery.\nSterilize the surgical area with povidone-iodine by scrubbing the area.\n3. Surgery\nNote: This section of the protocol follows general spine surgery techniques that can be referenced from any reputable spine surgery technique textbook19.\nMake an incision with a scalpel along the length of the spine over the appropriate vertebrae levels and continue to make a straight incision down until the bone is reached.\n\tNOTE: The size of the incision will depend on the size of the pathology. For example, if the tumor spans two vertebral levels, then at least two vertebral levels will need to be exposed. When the bone is exposed, an X-ray with a portable X-ray machine can be performed to verify the correct vertebrae.",
    "Perform subperiosteal dissection by electrosurgical cautery and expose the spinous process which is visualized as a bulbous bony process. Turn the cutting edge ventrally and sweep across the laminar.\nUse a combination of a Leksell bone plier and a highspeed drill to remove the bony lamina and spinous process to expose the ligamentum flavum underneath.\nUse an angled Curette and Kerrison bone punch to remove the ligamentum flavum to reveal the dura mater underneath.\nUse bipolar and hemostatic matrix to achieve hemostasis.\n\tNOTE: The success of a good ultrasound image relies upon a clean surgical field.\n4. Intraoperative Ultrasound\nUse a mobile ultrasound machine and a transducer probe with a 20 mm diameter.\n\tNOTE: The probe should have a 10 to 4.4 MHz frequency range. Any comparable device with similar probe diameter and frequency range should suffice.\nAfter the bony removal and dura exposure, fill the surgical field with sufficient saline solution such that the ultrasound transducer probe can be submerged.\n\tNOTE: Generally, a range of 100-500 mL of saline solution is needed. The saline solution allows for acoustic coupling.\nTurn on the ultrasound machine and place the ultrasound probe within the saline bath at the level of interest to begin acquiring images.\n\tNOTE: It is not necessary to place the probe directly touching the dura or spinal cord. Images are acquired on the ultrasound screen in real-time and can be interpreted immediately by the surgeon. Images on the screen can be captured at any time by pressing the Freeze button and can be saved by pressing the Save button.\nAcquire real time images in the longitudinal plane by placing the ultrasound probe in line with the direction of the spinal canal to visualize the spinal cord and the lesion similar to the sagittal images from the MRI.",
    "Acquire real time images in the transverse plane by placing the ultrasound probe perpendicular to the spinal canal to visualize the spinal cord and the lesion like the axial images from the MRI.\nAcquire real-time images to verify the location of lesions that cannot be directly visualized, to correlate with the preoperative CT or MRI images, to guide surgical tool placement, and/or to confirm the resolution of pathology.\n\tNOTE: When needed, a small piece of sterile compressed sponge approximately 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm can be used as a hyperechoic surgical marker to be placed in the surgical field and help correlate the surgical location with the image location. This helps to locate the lesion during the surgery and also helps to identify the margin of the tumor.\n5. Postoperative Follow-up\nAfter discharge, have the patient return to the clinic within one month for follow-up.\nPerform a neurological assessment and CT or MRI scans to confirm the resolution of the symptoms and pathology.\nSubscription Required.
