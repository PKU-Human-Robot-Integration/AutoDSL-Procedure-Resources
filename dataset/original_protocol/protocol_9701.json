    "The protocol was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (Medical and ethical review [2021] No. 022). Before the experiment, each medium was prepared according to Juergen A. Knoblich's formula12 (Supplementary Tables 1-4), or a commercially available Cerebral Organoid Kit was used (see Table of Materials). The iPSCs used in this study were previously established by our laboratory and have obtained an informed exemption. The SCA3-iPSCs were generated from a 31-year-old female spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) patient genotyped as harboring 26/78 CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene13 (Supplementary Figure 1A). The normal human iPSCs mentioned in a previous article were selected as NC-iPSCs14, and the ATXN3 gene was identified as having 14/14 CAG repeats (Supplementary Figure 1B).\n1. Preparation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)\nCollect 3 mL of peripheral blood by venipuncture with the informed consent of volunteers and patients.\nIsolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells according to the Ficoll-Paque method15.\nEstablish iPSCs according to the protocol of the Sendai Reprogramming Kit (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nCulture the iPSCs with mTeSR1 medium in 35 mm Petri dishes covered with Matrigel (a basement membrane matrix, see Table of Materials). Change the medium every day. The iPSC growth density must not exceed 75%.\nDigest the cells with PSC dissociation solution (see Table of Materials) and subculture them at a ratio of 1:5 every 3-5 days.\n\t\tCAUTION: Sendai virus is used here. It must be operated in the biosafety cabinet, and self-protection measures must be taken. It should be clear whether it can be used legally in the local country. Local biosafety laws and regulations must be strictly followed when used.\n2. EB preparation (days 0-1)",
    "Remove the mTeSR1 medium from the iPSCs with a pipette and wash it 2x with 1 mL of 1x PBS.\nRemove the PBS with a pipette, and add 300 µL of cell detachment solution (see Table of Materials) to digest the iPSCs into single cells for 3-4 min at 37 °C.\nResuspend the cells in 2 mL of EB-formation medium (Supplementary Table 1) and then centrifuge the sample for 5 min at 300 x g (room temperature).\nPretreat the specialized 24-well plate with anti-adherence rinsing solution (500 µL/well) for 5 min (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Anti-adherence rinsing solution is essential for optimal EB and spheroid formation.\nResuspend the cells in EB-formation medium containing Y-27632 (final concentration, 10 µM, see Table of Materials), with a cell density of 1.5 x 106 cells/mL.\nRemove the anti-adherence rinsing solution, and rinse each well with 2 mL of EB-formation medium.\nAdd the cells to the specialized 24-well plates at a density of 3 x 106 cells/well (Figure 1A, left).\n\tNOTE: Normally, 300 EBs can be prepared in each well. This method can prepare large quantities of EBs of the same size.\nCentrifuge the plate at 100 x g for 2 min at room temperature. Uniformly distribute the cells in each chamber at the bottom of the plate (Figure 1A, right).\n\tNOTE: If there is no suitable centrifuge, the plate can also be directly placed into the incubator for static culture, but the formation time of the EB ball will be several hours later than that under normal centrifugation.\nIncubate the samples at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. If centrifugation was not used in the previous step, incubate for 36 h. Keep the sample steady, and do not take it out of the incubator during this period.",
    "3. Preparation of the soft light lamp (day 1)\nUse a transparent acrylic board with a thickness of 0.3-0.5 cm in the size of A5 paper. Paste white pads on the front and back of the acrylic plate.\n\t\nInstall a row of LED white lights on the edge of the plate so that the lights can enter from the side of the acrylic plate and then shoot out in parallel (Supplementary Figure 2A-F, Figure 1B).\n\t\tNOTE: As the diameters of EBs in the early stage are approximately 200 µm to 300 µm, it is difficult to observe them clearly with the naked eye under the fluorescent lamp of clean benches. In contrast, due to the enhancement of diffuse reflection, we can detect the EBs clearly by using laterally illuminated soft light (Figure 1B, C). A 6-well plate is recommended for EB cultures in subsequent experiments. However, to better show the visual effect of soft light, dishes are sometimes used to take pictures and videos in this study instead of plates, so please do not misunderstand. The laterally illuminated soft light lamp can also be used for the 6-well plate.\n4. EB transfer and medium replacement (days 2-5)\nPrepare a new 6-well low adhesion plate, and add 2 mL of EB-formation medium to each well.\nRemove the EBs together with the medium with a 1000 µL wide-bore pipette tip (see Table of Materials) and transfer them to the 6-well low adhesion plate (~100 EBs/well).\n\tNOTE: The operation process adopts a soft light lamp (mentioned in step 3.) to make the EBs easier to observe. Turn off other indoor light sources to get the visual effect of the soft light better.",
    "Replace with the same volume of fresh EB-formation medium every day. Use the secondary flow to gather the EBs to the center and change the medium.\n\t\nAspirate the old medium by pipetting to the edge of the well slowly. Do not suck too hard; otherwise, the EBs will be removed together. Then, add fresh medium to resuspend the EBs.\n\t\tNOTE: The principle secondary flow (Figure 1D). Induce a swirl flow by rotating the dish along a circular orbit. Due to the swirl flow, a secondary flow is induced directed toward the center. The EBs or organoids converge to the center of the well due to the secondary flow generated through rotation, after which medium change or embryoid transfer can be executed readily.\n5. Checking pluripotency by labeling with pluripotency marker OCT4 (day 4)\nNOTE: When the diameter of the EBs is greater than 300 µm, take several EBs for OCT4 marker immunofluorescence staining to detect their pluripotency.\nFix the EBs in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by washing in 1x PBS 3x for 10 min each time.\nTransfer the EBs to room temperature PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% BSA for 2 h, followed by washing in PBS 3x for 10 min each time.\n\tNOTE: After being treated withTriton X-100, the EBs float on the liquid surface and can be easily sucked away with the liquid during cleaning. Operation under a stereomicroscope is recommended.\nDilute the OCT4 primary antibody (see Table of Materials) with 1 mL of 1x PBS containing 1% BSA at a ratio of 1:200 and add to the EBs for incubation at 4 °C overnight, then wash in PBS 3x for 10 min each time.",
    "Dilute the respective secondary antibody (see Table of Materials) with 1x PBS at 1:500 and add 1 mL to the EBs.\nAfter incubating at room temperature for 2 h, wash the cells in 1x PBS 3x for 10 min each time.\nRemove the PBS, add 2 mL of 1x PBS solution containing 1 µg/mL DAPI, incubate at room temperature for 10 min, and then wash in PBS 3x for 10 min each time.\nMove the EB containing a small amount of liquid onto the slide, seal the slide with a cover glass coated with commercially available petroleum jelly (see Table of Materials) on the edge, and then observe and collect the image under the fluorescence confocal microscope.\n\tNOTE: OCT4 expression represents EB pluripotency12. When the expression of OCT4 is less than 90%, the EBs should be discarded, and EBs should be prepared again.\n6. Neural induction (days 5-7)\nPrepare a new 6-well plate with low adhesion, and add 3 mL of Neural induction medium (Supplementary Table 2) to each well.\nTurn on the lateral soft light (mentioned in step 3.) and turn off other indoor light sources.\nTransfer the EBs to the 6-well plate with added Neural induction medium (~100 EBs/well). Add as little as possible of the original medium to the new well.\n\tNOTE: Introduce simple skills oforganoid transfer. Naturally, under gravity and with a relatively higher density than the medium, the resuspended EBs will gradually sink by applying the operation shown in Figure 1E. Hence, the EBs can be conveniently transferred. Since, compared to EBs, free cells and dead cell fragments sink more slowly, most of the free cells and dead cell fragments can thus be removed through this sedimentation method (Figure 1F).\nIncubate the samples at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.",
    "NOTE: Under the microscope, the diameter of the EBs was approximately 500 µm, and the edge was translucent, indicating that a neuroepithelial layer formed.\nProceed to the next step.\n7. Embedding in the basement membrane matrix (days 7​-10)\nPlace the membrane matrix in a 4 °C refrigerator for 60 min in advance to dissolve. Calculate the amount of the required matrix in advance. Approximately 100 EBs were embedded in 1.5 mL of the membrane matrix.\nTurn on the lateral soft light and turn off the light source on the top of the console.\nKeep the membrane matrix on ice to prevent solidification.\nTransfer a small amount of EBs to a 60 mm dish containing fresh Expansion medium (Supplementary Table 3) each time. Reduce the number of EBs to make it easier to remove a single EB.\nThen, use a new 6-well low adhesion plate. Suck a single EB (containing approximately 10 µL medium) with a 200 µL wide-bore pipette tip (see Table of Materials) each time, and then add it to the bottom of the 6-well plate to make droplets. Use five droplets per well.\n\tNOTE: The key is to adjust the range of the pipette gun to 50 µL and suck an EB, and then refer to the operation of Figure 1E. When the EB settles to the bore of the pipette tip, the tip quickly touches the well bottom of the plate and pushes out approximately 10 µL of liquid to form a droplet.\nAdd 15 µL of the membrane matrix to each drop containing EB and mix it quickly. Embed the EB ball in the center of the droplet.\n\tNOTE: EBs must not be aspirated with a standard pipette tip, which damages the EB. The 200 µL wide-bore pipette tip needs to be used instead.",
    "Place the 6-well plate into a 37 °C incubator for 30 min, and solidify the membrane matrix droplets containing EBs.\nAdd 3 mL of the Expansion medium to each well and gently blow up the matrix-embedded EBs to suspend them.\nIncubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 days.\n\t​NOTE: If budding on the surface of EB is observed, it means that an expanded neuroepithelium has been formed16.\n8. Organoid maturation (days 10-40)\nGently remove the original medium, and add 3 mL of Maturation medium (Supplementary Table 4) to each well.\nPlace the organoid plate on a horizontal shaker in a 37 °C incubator.\nContinue to rotate the culture horizontally. Set the shaker to the appropriate speed.\n\tNOTE: When culturing cerebral organoids on a 6-well plate, a relative centrifugal force (RCF) of 0.11808 x g is more appropriate, according to the manufacturer of the horizontal shaker (see Table of Materials). According to the conversion between the relative centrifugal force and rotating speed17,18, RCF = 1.118 x 10−5 × R × rpm2, where RCF = relative centrifugal force (g), rpm = revolutions per minute (r/min), and R = rotation radius (cm), also known as shaking throw. The shaking throw parameters of different shakers may be different. Therefore, it can be estimated that the rotating speed is rpm = 299 x (RCF/R)1/2.\nChange the fresh Maturation medium every 2-3 days.\nAfter 20-30 days, gradually culture the cerebral organoids to maturity.\n\t​NOTE: During this period, organoids can be used for experiments and detection, such as neural marker detection and transcriptome sequencing19,20,21.\n9. Frozen sections and immunofluorescence of cerebral organoids\nFix the organoids in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 16 h and then wash them 3x with 1x PBS for 10 min each time.",
    "Remove the PBS, and immerse the organoids in 30% sucrose at 4 °C overnight.\nEmbed the organoids in 10%/7.5% gelatine/sucrose at 37 °C for 1 h and then quickly transfer them to the embedding mold.\nAdd dry ice to 100% ethanol to prepare a dry ice/ethanol slurry, and place the organoid samples in it for quick freezing.\nStore the frozen samples in a −80 °C freezer. When required, make frozen sections with a thickness of 20 µm.\nRefer to Steps 5.3.-5.5. for immunofluorescence. Use the PAX6 antibody to label apical progenitor cells, the TUJ1 antibody (see Table of Materials) to label neuronal cells22,23,24, and DAPI for nuclear DNA staining.\nSubscription Required.
