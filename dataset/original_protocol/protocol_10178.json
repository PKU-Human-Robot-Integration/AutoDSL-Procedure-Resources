    "Collection of biopsies of the human parietal pericardium for use in this work was performed after written informed consent, as previously described33. The study of human tissues conform to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki34 and was approved by The Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for Southern Denmark (S-20100044 and S-20140202) and the Danish Data Protection Agency.\n1. Collect Tissue and Isolate (Human) Resistance Artery\nCollect tissue samples of interest immediately upon the excision during a surgery. Transfer the tissue to 4 °C HEPES buffered physiological salt solution (HBS) immediately upon collection and store it in HBS.\n\tNOTE: Human tissues are only collected following approval by relevant institutional and ethical committees as well as patients' written informed consent. HBS composition in mM: NaCl 144, KCl 4.7, CaCl2 2.5, MgSO4 1.2, KH2PO4 1.2, HEPES 14.9, glucose 5.5. Adjust the pH 7.4 with NaOH, and filter the solution though 0.2 µm filter.\nLeave the collected tissue in sterile HBS at 4 °C overnight to wash out anesthetics.\n\tNOTE: Any effect of overnight storage on vessel integrity and functionality should be checked by the individual research laboratory.\nCarefully isolate resistance sized arteries (± 200 µm lumen diameter) using a pair of sharp-tip forceps and micro-dissection scissors.\nStore the arteries at 4 °C in ice-cold HBS while priming the imaging/pressure chamber.\n2. Mount the Isolated Artery in the Pressure Myograph\nMount the glass cannulae with tip diameters of ~80 µm on cannulae holders. Position the tips approximately 150 µm above the chamber glass bottom.\n\tNOTE: 45° bended tip cannulae may allow precise positioning of the vessel above the glass bottom.\nFill both inlet and outlet tubing with HBS with 1% BSA and connect to the pressure system.\n\tNOTE: BSA is included to preserve endothelial cell function.",
    "Mount the isolated artery using two double knot sutures per cannula.\n\tNOTE: Knots can be prepared in advance and stored on double adhesive tape until needed.\nFill the chamber with HBS and place two double knots on each glass cannula.\n\tNOTE: When using arteries displaying myogenic tone, HBS should be replaced with calcium free HBS supplemented with 3 µM EGTA and 3 µM sodium nitroprusside.\nHold the artery gently at one end using two pairs of sharp tip forceps. Open the lumen of the artery and gently slide it onto the cannula. Fix on cannula using two knots.\nApply a pressure of 5 mmHg to gently flush the lumen with HBS / 1% BSA.\nCannulate the other end of the artery and secure it on the cannula using two double knots.\nTransfer the myograph to the microscope stage and pressurize the artery to 5 mmHg (inlet pressure = outlet pressure), then heat to 37 °C for 30 min.\nOptional: Calibrate the longitudinal force transducer according to the manufacturer's instructions (1 g = 9.81 mN).\n\tNOTE: It is essential to calibrate the force transducer after heating as it is temperature sensitive.\n3. Perform Experiment: Imaging of Arterial Diameter, Wall Thickness and Collagen and Elastin Microarchitecture Using TPEM\nQuickly scan the cannulated artery pressurized to 5 mmHg using a 20X objective (numerical aperture (NA) ≥ 0.8) and low power excitation light to assess vessel diameter and wall thickness at 5 mmHg.\n\tNOTE: For inverted microscopes, use a water immersion objective; for upright microscopes, use a water dipping objective. If the objective does not have a correction collar to correct for cover slip thickness, make sure to match the used cover slip with the objective used. The software settings and descriptions may vary depending on the user-interphase and microscope and software used.",
    "Setup the optical path.\n\t\t\nActivate Mai Tai two-photon laser and set it to 820 nm excitation light.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: Avoid any exposure to visible as well as invisible laser light.\nCollect emission simultaneously in two channels. Split emission light between the photomultipliers using a 460 nm long pass dichroic mirror and collect emission using 30-60 nm wide bandpass filters centered at 520 nm (elastin) and 410 nm (collagen), respectively.\nEnable continuous scanning with 10 µs laser dwell time/pixel and 512 × 512 pixels for 100% field of view.\nManually scan through the artery to determine the depth where maximum diameter is observed.\nChoose a rectangular slice covering the artery's widest diameter and scan a single frame with pixel size ≤ 300 nm/pixel (Figure 2C). Use as low excitation light power and pixel dwell time as possible to avoid photodamaging the live artery.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to obtain a rectangular, e.g., 100 × 1024 pixel image, rather than quadratic image at this position to save time and limit the tissue photon exposure (Figure 2C).\nSave the image for later analyses.\nDetermine lumen diameter and wall thickness at the maximum diameter of the artery.\n\t\nLoad the image in Fiji.\nSet the scale by clicking Main menu | Analyze | set scale and enter µm/pixel and pixel ratio (it is highly recommended to keep the pixel ratio 1:1).\nChoose the Fiji line tool and draw a line between the two internal elastic laminae at each side of the arterial lumen, and click ctrl + M. Fiji reports length as default in the results table.\nLikewise, draw more lines to measure thickness of each wall, and click ctrl + M to measure the following markup.\nSave the measurements.",
    "Image collagen and elastin microarchitecture at 5 mmHg by scanning the entire thickness of the arterial wall, obtaining 3D image stacks with good quality for 1-3 regions of interest along the length of the artery.\n\t\nObtain image stacks through the entire wall of the artery using a 60X objective, NA ≥ 1, optimized pixel sizes and z-spacing.\n\t\t\nCalculate the optimal imaging conditions (pixel sizes and z-step spacing) in accordance with the optical pathway, immersion medium and sample refractive indices using the Scientific Volume Imaging Nyquist calculator (https://svi.nl/NyquistCalculator).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Please pay attention here to the difference between optimal pixel size and z-spacing versus the advice in section 3.4. above on the use of a maximum pixel size.\nUse the same excitation and emission settings as above (3.1.1.).\nQuickly scan the vessel wall as described above to determine the thickness of the z-stack.\nDefine the z-stack start and end depth, z-step spacing and pixel density (calculated in 3.3.1.1.) and perform the z- scan. Save each channel separately.\n\t\tNOTE: Images should be small enough e.g. 30 x 30 µm or 50 × 50 µm depending on the vessel size to avoid any influence of curvature in the subsequent image analyses.\nDetermine arterial diameter, wall thickness, and elastin and collagen microarchitecture at remaining pressures of protocol.\n\t\nRepeat 3.1-3.2 at pressures 10 and 20 mmHg, repeat 3.3 at pressure 20 mmHg.\nRepeat 3.1 and 3.2 at pressure 40 mmHg.\nRepeat 3.1-3.2 at pressures 60, 80, and 100 mmHg and repeat 3.3 at 100 mmHg.",
    "NOTE: 3.1-3.3 can be repeated for all pressures, and combinations of pressures (e.g. a series/combination of increasing as well as decreasing pressures), depending on the hypothesis to be tested. Eosin in concentration 0.3 - 1 µM may be added to enhance elastin autofluorescence in case of photobleaching. Photobleaching can be avoided by applying as low power excitation light as possible.\nReplace the buffer in the myograph chamber with fresh 37 °C HBS after each pressure step. Allow the artery to adapt for 5 min prior to imaging following each change in pressure.\nStore channel stacks separately for image analyses.\nTest viability of the artery.\n\t\nApply 10 µM U46619 in the myograph chamber followed by the addition of 10 µM bradykinin when a stable constriction is observed.\nRecord diameter and wall thickness as described above in section 3.1 following the application of each of the compounds.\nAdd 3 µM sodium nitroprusside when the artery is not fully dilated following the addition of bradykinin and record diameter and wall thickness.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the pharmacological properties of the artery of interest (vascular bed and species) other vasoconstrictor and (endothelium-dependent) vasodilator compounds can be used.\nOptional: Fix the pressurized artery or continue with imaging of collagen and elastin for volume densities (step 7).\n\t\nAdd 4% formaldehyde in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 1 h.\nWash the fixed artery three times in 1x PBS and gently slide the artery off the cannulae, touching only the parts of the artery outside the knots. Do not remove the knots, use them for holding the artery when transferring to a storage tube.\nStore in 1x PBS / 0.05 % sodium azide at 4 °C until imaging for elastin and collagen volume densities or other purposes.",
    "NOTE: Fixed arteries can be stored for at least 3 months in 1x PBS / 0.05 % sodium azide at 4 °C.\n4. Calculation of Stress Strain Relationships and Intrinsic Wall Stiffness\nPlease follow the formulas and calculation steps for calculating stresses, strains, and wall stiffness as described by Bloksgaard, M. et al.13 and references herein.\n5. Image Analysis - (Internal Elastic Lamina) IEL Branching Angles\nOpen image stack in Fiji. Go to file | open image to choose image stack.\n\tNOTE: Max intensity projections of 2-7 consecutive z-sections covering the IEL (1-2 µm thickness) are used for determining the IEL elastin fiber branching angles using the angle tool in Fiji28,35. Refer to Figure 4A for illustration.\nGo to Image | stacks | z project… to choose the images and \"Max Intensity Projection\".\nSave the max intensity projection as TIFF.\nChoose as many IEL fiber branching points as possible using the \"angle tool\", and work systematically through the images. Click ctrl + M to measure each angle.\nSave the Fiji results sheet.\n6. Image Analysis - Adventitial Collagen Waviness\nOpen image stack in Fiji. Go to file | open image to choose image stack.\n\tNOTE: Max intensity projections of 2-7 consecutive z-sections covering collagen right outside the external elastic lamina (EEL, 1-4 µm thickness) are used for determining collagen waviness using the Fiji NeuronJ plugin36 as described by Rezakhaniha, R. et al.37(Figure 4B).\nSet the scale. Go to analyze | set scale to enter pixel dimensions.\nGo to Image | stacks | z project… to choose images to work with and \"Max Intensity Projection\".\nChange Image type to 8 bitt TIFF by clicking Image | type | 8 bitt and save the max intensity projection as TIFF.\nMeasure collagen fiber straightness using the Fiji Neuron J Plugin.",
    "Open the NeuronJ plugin by clicking Fiji | Plugins | Neuron J.\nOpen the 8bit TIFF in NeuronJ by clicking Load Image | Select File.\nClick add tracings, and select fibers to analyze by clicking on start and end of each fiber.\nClick Measure tracings, choose display tracing (Lf) and vertex measurements in the dialog box.\nCalculate L0/Lf in excel (or similar) and save the results.\n\t\nCopy and paste Fiji Neuron J tracings and vertices output to excel (or similar) and calculate L0 using Pythagoras's theorem from the vertex measurements. First and last point on line indicate the positions of the ends of the hypotenuse in a 2D coordinate system.\n\t\tNOTE: A L0/Lf [collagen fiber bundle end-to-end length via a straight line (L0) / full length (Lf)] close to 1 indicates an almost straight collagen fiber.\n7. Imaging for Collagen and Elastin Volume Densities\nWash the (fixed) artery 1x in PBS and stain it for 15 min in 1 µM eosin in 1x PBS in the dark. For fixed arteries, perform this step at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Eosin enhances the elastin fluorescence. Eosin will stain other structures such as collagen and the cell cytoplasm if the sample is left in the staining solution for extended time. If staining of other structures is too intense, lower the concentration of eosin to 0.3 µM or repeat washing.\nWash the artery 3x in 1x PBS\n\t\nFor fixed arteries: mount the artery for imaging.\n\t\tCaution: Imaging of non-pressurized vessels does not allow retrieval of any geometrical quantitative information. When absolute quantities are required, these should always be obtained on live, pressurized arteries. Volume-ratios can be obtained on the non-pressurized arteries with this method.",
    "Place two pieces of double adhesive tape 1-1.5 cm apart on an object glass. Double adhesive tape is approximately 100 µm thick. Apply one or more layers of tape to match the diameter of the artery to be mounted.\nPlace 10-20 µL of PBS on the glass in the middle of the square and place the artery in the PBS drop.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The drop should be as small and flat as possible to avoid pushing the artery out of position when mounting the cover slip.\nPlace the coverslip and press onto double adhesive tape.\nFill the reservoir between the coverslip and object glass with 1x PBS. Refill it every hour to avoid drying of the sample.\nObtain image-stacks for collagen and elastin volume densities using a 20X objective with NA > 1 to cover as much of the arterial wall as possible while still having a good optical resolution (Figure 2D, 2G and 2H).\n\tNOTE: Use a water immersion objective for imaging of fixed arteries under a coverslip, and use a water dipping objective for imaging of vital arteries. If the objective does not have a correction collar to correct for cover slip thickness, make sure to match the coverslip to the objective. Preferably use optimal pixel sizes and z-spacing. Calculate these using the Nyquist Calculator (step 3.3.1.1.). Alternatively, use a minimum pixel size of 300 nm and z-spacing of 1 µm. It is recommended to obtain three images along the length of the artery to allow the user to determine intra-assay variability.\nImage elastin using 820 nm excitation light and collect emission using a 30-60 nm wide bandpass filter centered at 520 nm.",
    "Image collagen using 990 nm excitation light to avoid any excitation of elastin and other autofluorescent proteins and collect emission using 10-30 nm wide bandpass filter centered at 495 nm.\nSave image stacks from each channel separately as TIFF files\n8. Image Analysis for Extracting Elastin and Collagen Volume Densities Using Ilastik\nConvert TIFF image stacks to HDF5 using Fiji28,35 by clicking Choose File | Save As… HDF5.\nCreate two data file folders on the computer hard drive, one for elastin, one for collagen image stacks, respectively. Copy relevant image stacks to the relevant folder.\nCreate two new Ilastik projects in the Ilastik software, one of elastin, one for collagen, respectively.\n\t\nOpen Ilastik | Create new project | pixel classification | new project | add data and select image folder created in step 8.2.\n\t\tNOTE: Follow the Ilastik wizard.\nImport one 3D image stack to train the software.\n\t\nSelect the Input Data applet | main workspace area | Raw Data tab | Add new … | Add separate Image(s) and choose the desired image data\nChoose relevant features in the software.\n\t\nOpen Feature Selection applet | Select Feature which opens a new dialog. See Figure 5A for details.\nAdd at least two labels using the Add Label button under the Training applet.\n\tNOTE: Each label will correspond to an object type that needs to be separated. In this work, three labels are used for elastin: elastin itself, bright spots (to be excluded), and background (to be excluded).\nDraw labels on top of the raw image stack using the paint brush styled annotation tool.\n\t\nSelect the appropriate label: click brush tool and start drawing.\nPrompt Ilastik to analyze the image stack and look for similar features by clicking Enable Live Update.\nCheck carefully the prediction map (Figure 5D).",
    "NOTE: The process from raw image to a complete prediction map is shown in Figure 5. Ilastik uses the prediction map to segment the image stack according to which label a pixel is more likely to be associated (Figure 5D).\nApply a threshold.\n\t\nSelect Thresholding applet, choose an appropriate method, input label, smooth, threshold and size filter parameters, and finally click Apply.\n\t\tNOTE: This segregates the similarly labeled parts of the image into discrete objects. Highly connected tissue, like elastin and collagen does not need to be segregated, therefore, a threshold of 0.4 is applied (the default is 0.5). Figure 5E and 5F illustrate the result of applying a threshold.\nRepeat the training of Ilastik until the outcome is satisfactory (only elastin, respectively collagen is recognized for the respective analyses).\n\t\nFrequently switch between the Training and Segmentation (and sometimes also the Thresholding) applets during this process. An example of the effect of re-training Ilastik is shown in Figure 6.\nBatch analyze similar image data: select batch prediction input selection and add relevant files.\n\tNOTE: The Ilastik output is a collection of pseudo-1bit 3D image stacks (image masks) with 0 (zero) denoting the absence of elastin (or collagen) and 1 (one) denoting the presence hereof (The actual bit depth is 8-bit).\nVerify the results for each image stack by visually comparing the image masks and the raw image files.\nOptimize the Ilastik mask (steps 8.4-8.9) and re-analyze any image stacks with unsatisfactory results.\nCalculate elastin and collagen volume densities from Ilastik image masks using MATLAB\n\t\nOpen MATLAB.\nSelect folder with ilastik image masks in MATLAB \"current folder\" window.\nCopy the MATLAB script from Supplementary File 1 to the MATLAB editor and save the code as volumeCalculator.m in the MATLAB folder on the computer hard drive.",
    "Enter pixel sizes and pixel height in the script lines\n\t\tpixelSize = 0.1230000*0.1230000; %micron*micron\n\t\tpixelHeight = 0.9; % micron\nSave the script.\nGo to MATLAB command window and enter \"volumeCalculator('path-to-data')\"to load the script.\nClick enter. Each Image mask is now summed up and multiplied by the (known) pixel/voxel volume (physical dimensions of a pixel multiplied by the z-axis resolution). The output from MATLAB is the total volume of elastin and collagen in each image stack.\nSave the results.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
