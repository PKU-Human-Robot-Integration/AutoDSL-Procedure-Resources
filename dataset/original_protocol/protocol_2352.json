This section will also detail how to culture the cells and label them with 13C-Glucose for downstream metabolite isolation and metabolomics.\nPrepare a 10 mL syringe with 5 mL PM isolation media (Store at 4°C for up to 2 weeks) and attach a 27 g needle. Keep on ice.\nEuthanize the mouse (following an approved IACUC euthanasia protocol).\nImmediately prior to dissection, place mouse face-up on sterile surface, pin down limbs, and spray abdomen with 70% EtOH. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1988-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mouse dissection preparation\nFigure depicts how to position and pin euthanized mouse to dissection board.\nUsing sterile surgical scissors and forceps carefully cut the skin overlying the peritoneum and gently pull it back to expose the inner skin that lines the peritoneal cavity.\nCritical: Do not cut into the peritoneal cavity since any compromise of this space will allow fluid to leak out and reduce final cell recovery. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nNote: If you accidentally cut the peritoneum open, you can use a hemostat forceps to close the opening and continue your isolation, however this may result in lower yields.\nInject peritoneal cavity with 5 mL of PM isolation media and massage the abdominal walls for 10–25 s to dislodge any attached peritoneal cells into the PM isolation media.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1988-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Peritoneal dissection\nShows how to remove skin while maintaining the underlying peritoneum.",
    "Critical: When injecting the peritoneal cavity, be careful to avoid puncturing the intestine or other abdominal organs. You can avoid this by using your forceps to pull on the peritoneum and insert your needle inside the tented space. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nUsing a new 10 mL syringe equipped with a 25 g needle, draw back up the PM isolation media and collect in 50 mL conical tube on ice. This is the peritoneal lavage and will contain the PMs and other peritoneal cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1988-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Steps for peritoneal lavage\n(A) Use forceps to gently grasp peritoneum, (B) Lift peritoneum to create a tent, (C) Insert needle filled with lavage fluid into tented area, (D) inject peritoneal lavage fluid.\nTo the 50 mL conical tube containing the peritoneal lavage, add PM isolation media up to the 30 mL mark.\nPellet peritoneal cells & RBC Lysis.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 10 min to pellet cells.\nAspirate supernatant. There should be a small rim of white cell pellet at the bottom of the conical tube.\nIf the color of the pellet is orange or red in color, this may indicate RBC contamination. Proceed to RBC lysis step.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL RBC lysis buffer and pipette gently up and down until solution is homogenous.\nCritical: Avoid creating bubbles or pipetting too harshly.\nAdd additional 4 mL RBC lysis buffer and incubate for 5 min on ice.\nFollowing 5 min incubation, add PBS to a volume of 40 mL to quench the lysis.\nCritical: RBC lysis buffer can be toxic to cells if incubated too long. PBS must be added immediately following 5 min incubation period.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 10 min to pellet cells and aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend and plate PMs",
    "Resuspend pelleted cells in 1 mL Complete RPMI media (Store at 4°C for up to 2 weeks).\nSplit your cells evenly into 3 groups. One group will be for unstimulated PMs, a second group will be for LPS treatment, and the third group will be for protein concentration measurement (normalization well).\nPlate experimental groups (unstimulated and LPS treated) into one 24-well plate, and the normalization well onto a new 24-well plate. This will allow for easier isolation of the normalization well, without disrupting the experimental groups during incubation.\nNote: Since the peritoneal lavage is a mix of different cells (i.e., B cells, T cells, epithelial cells, and resident macrophages), initial cell counts will not be accurate for plating macrophages. Thus, it is necessary to have an extra well for normalization.\nIncubate cells in standard cell culture incubator for 2 h. Incubator conditions: temperature of 37°C, CO2 concentration ∼5%, and pH ∼7.3–7.5.\nMacrophages will avidly stick to cell culture plates, while other cell types (B and T cells) will not.\nFigure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] shows a representative image of PM isolated cells in culture dish.\nDuring the incubation period, prepare 13C-Glucose RPMI media (Store at 4°C for up to 2 weeks) and bring to 37°C in a water bath.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1988-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative image of expected PM isolation after plating\nPrepare two tubes, one with 13C-Glucose RPMI media and another with LPS (200 ng/mL) in 13C-Glucose RPMI media.\nNote: For our specific experiment, we were comparing the metabolic profile of PMs with and without TLR4 stimulation. We split our experimental groups into unstimulated control and LPS treated samples.\nAfter 2 h, aspirate the media and gently wash with 0.5 mL of PBS to remove non-adherent cells. The remaining cells will be mostly Macrophages.",
    "Add 0.5 mL of 13C-Glucose RPMI media or LPS + 13C-Glucose RPMI media. Incubator conditions: temperature of 37°C, CO2 concentration ∼5%, and pH ∼7.3–7.5.\nNote: Depending on the metabolite pool of interest, the incubation period for labeling will vary (Jang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). In our experiment we aimed to label glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates, and found that for PMs, a 4-h incubation period was sufficient to ensure proper labeling of these metabolites.\nDuring the 4-h 13C-Glucose labeling incubation, measure protein concentration and prepare for metabolite isolation.\nTake the normalization well and measure the total protein concentration; we suggest Pierce BCA Kit. Calculate the total protein per well, which will determine the amount of Metabolite isolation reagent (80% acetonitrile LC-MS grade and 20% H2O HPLC grade, Store at −20ºC for up to 1 month) needed for isolation in subsequent steps.\nTry to dilute your samples to a final concentration of 0.5–1 μg/μL in metabolite isolation reagent. i.e., if your protein concentration is 1.5 μg/μL in 50 μL total volume for your normalization well, then you will want to add 75–150 μL.\nPrepare the Metabolite isolation reagent and place in −20°C for at least 2 h before use. Prepare an ice bucket to keep plates cold during metabolite isolation. Label two sets of 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and prechill on ice.\nMove on to metabolite isolation step below.\nMetabolite isolation & analysis\nTiming: 1 day\nThese steps will detail how to rapidly and efficiently isolate metabolites using a simple acetonitrile-based metabolite isolation reagent. This step will also detail how to prepare isolated metabolites for analysis using tandem mass-spectrometry.\nAfter the 4-h labeling incubation, aspirate the labeling media.\nDo a quick wash with 0.5 mL of PBS and aspirate the PBS.",
    "Note: Try to remove all remaining media/PBS from the wells before proceeding to isolation step. Excess salt from these buffers will interfere with downstream LC-MS analysis.\nPlace plate(s) on ice and add Metabolite isolation reagent (−20°C) based on normalization well concentration to each sample.\nNote: Try to keep all items on ice as much as possible and proceed through these steps as quickly as possible to prevent metabolite degradation.\nUsing the pipette tip, pipette up and down (avoid generating bubbles) and scrape the bottom of the well to dislodge any cells and help with homogenizing the solution.\nTransfer solution to a prechilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nVortex each sample 1x for 15 s and freeze lysates at −80°C for 1h.\nPause point: Conversely, samples can be frozen at -80°C for 16–24 h, if you choose to pause at this point.\nAfter 1h, or the next day if incubating 16–24 h, thaw lysates on ice and vortex 15 s.\nCentrifuge 20,000 g for 30 min at 4°C.\nTransfer supernatant to new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and place on ice.\nCritical: Avoid aspirating any of the cell pellet when collecting supernatant. Any amount of protein contamination will affect mass spectrometry (MS) measurements of metabolite concentrations.\nNote: Additional freeze thaw cycles (step 21–22) can be done to increase metabolite yield within the same volume of Metabolite isolation reagent.\nPause point: If proceeding to MS same day, keep on ice. If you plan to run the MS another day, you can store the samples in −80°C for up to a month or freeze in liquid nitrogen for up to 6 months.\nSamples are now ready for high-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) metabolomic measurement.",
    "The amount added to the LC column is typically 10–15 μL, and the cell number per microliter will depend on the specific yield for each individual well isolated per sample (see step 14a).\nOur samples were analyzed using the Northwestern Metabolomics Core.\nThe system consists of a Thermo Q-Exactive in line with an electrospray source and an Ultimate3000 (Thermo) series HPLC consisting of a binary pump, degasser, and auto-sampler outfitted with an Xbridge Amide column (Waters; dimensions of 4.6 mm × 100 mm and a 3.5 μm particle size).\nThe mobile phase A contained 95% (vol/vol) water, 5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile, 20 mM ammonium hydroxide, 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH = 9.0; B was 100% Acetonitrile.\nThe gradient was as following: 0 min, 15% A; 2.5 min, 30% A; 7 min, 43% A; 16 min, 62% A; 16.1–18 min, 75% A; 18–25 min, 15% A with a flow rate of 400 μL/min.\nThe capillary of the ESI source was set to 275°C, with sheath gas at 45 arbitrary units, auxiliary gas at 5 arbitrary units and the spray voltage at 4.0 kV.\nIn positive/negative polarity switching mode, an m/z scan range from 70 to 850 was chosen and MS1 data was collected at a resolution of 70,000.\nThe automatic gain control (AGC) target was set at 1,000,000 and the maximum injection time was 200 ms.\nThe dynamic exclusion was set to 10 s and the Apex trigger was set to off\nThe top 5 precursor ions were subsequently fragmented, in a data-dependent manner, using the higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) cell set to 30% normalized collision energy in MS2 at a resolution power of 17,500.\nThe sample volumes of 10 μL were injected.",
