    "The experiments described in this manuscript were performed according to the guidelines outlined in the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Yokohama City University.\n1. Preparation of neuron balls as hanging drop culture (Days in vitro (DIV) 0-3)\nNOTE: The procedures described here for the preparation of neuron ball culture are based on the method previously reported by the Sasaki group with some modifications9,10. We also adopted several procedures from the Banker method for dissociated culture14.\nConfirming the followings before starting the dissection\nPrepare all the required solutions and sterilize them by autoclave/filtration in advance.\nKeep ready all the instruments and materials to be used in each steps of this cortical neuron culture.\nSpray and wipe the laminar air flow cabinet, dissection table, stage plate of stereomicroscope, scissors, and forceps with 70% ethanol.\nEuthanize the mouse upon application of CO2 and dissect the abdomen to obtain E16 embryos.\nRemove the brains from embryos carefully with the help of fine tips of forceps and transfer them into 60 mm cell culture dishes containing 4 mL of HEPES Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS).\n\tNOTE: The dissection medium HBSS contains 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.09 mM Na2HPO4, 1.1 mM KH2PO4, 5.6 mM D-glucose, and 5.64 µM phenol red.\nRemove the scalp, cut the olfactory bulb, separate cortices from each cerebral hemisphere using the fine tips of forceps under stereomicroscope, and transfer to another 60 mm dishes containing fresh HBSS. Use at least 3-5 embryos for each separate neuron ball culture.\nCut the cortices into small pieces with microdissecting spring scissors in a laminar flow cell culture hood.",
    "Transfer minced cortices to a 15 mL tube and trypsinize the minced cortices in 4 mL of 0.125% trypsin in HBSS for 4.5 min in a water bath at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: This trypsinization time is critical for efficient neuron culture as the increasing time (> 4.5 min) leads to much more dead neurons.\nTransfer the cell aggregates to a new 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of HBSS by a sterile transfer pipette, and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Repeat this step one more time.\nTransfer the cell aggregates to a new 15 mL tube containing 2 mL of Neurobasal media containing GlutaMax, B27 supplement (NGB medium), 0.01% DNase I and 10% horse serum.\nTriturate the trypsinized cortices by repeatedly pipetting them up and down (3-5 times) using fire-polished fine glass Pasteur pipette.\n\tNOTE: Diameter of fire-polished fine glass Pasteur pipette is very important as described in the Banker method paper14. If the pipette is too narrow to pass cortices, prepare pipettes possessing 2-3 different sizes, and try from larger pipette.\nFor preparing neuron balls, take the above cell suspension and adjust the cell density to 1 x 106 cells/mL using NGB medium.\nCulture the cortical neurons as hanging drops containing 10,000 cells/drop (1 drop is 10 µL) inside the upper lids of 10 cm culture dishes.\nAdd 7 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the bottom part of culture dishes, then keep in an incubator for 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 under humidified condition to allow for neuron ball formation.\n2. Placing neuron balls on PLL-coated glass coverslips and culture maintenance (DIV 3-11)",
    "NOTE: Before coating of glass coverslips with poly-L-lysine (PLL), washing the coverslips using detergent is important. Glass coverslips are sometimes not so clean for neuronal culture and uniform coating with PLL. Non-uniform PLL coating may result in uneven axonal extension of neuron balls.\nSoak the coverslips in 1/20 diluted neutral non-phosphorous detergent in ceramic racks for 1-3 overnights.\nWash the coverslips 8 times in ultrapure water, and then sterilize in an oven at 200 °C for 12 h.\n\tNOTE: All the steps from here must be done in a laminar air flow cell culture hood.\nTransfer baked coverslips to 100-mm dishes. After sealing the dish by parafilm between a lid and a bottom dish, baked coverslips can be kept for long-term storage.\n(Optional) Apply paraffin dots to the coverslips. The dots make space to prevent neuron balls detaching from the coverslips during immunostaining by direct contact of neuron balls to plastic dishes. Melt paraffin in a suitable bottle in a hot water bath at about 90 °C. Dip a Pasteur pipette into the paraffin, then rapidly touch it to make three spots near the edge of a coverslip.\nCoat PLL (MW > 300,000) onto the paraffin-beaded glass coverslips in 60-mm dishes using PLL solution (15 μg/mL in borate buffer), and keep them for at least 1 h in a CO2 incubator.\nAfter washing 4 times with PBS, transfer the PLL-coated coverslips to a 4-well plate containing 350 µL of NGB medium in each well and cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside hydrochloride (AraC, 3 μM) to the media to kill dividing cells.\nKeep this 4-well plate containing the PLL-coated coverslips in the CO2 incubator at least for 20 min to ensure the temperature of the medium reach 37 °C before transferring neuron balls.",
    "At DIV 3 when “neuron balls” are formed very well, transfer them onto PLL-coated coverslips inside the 4-well plate (5 neuron balls/well) kept in the CO2 incubator.\nAfter 48 h, replace the neuron ball culture medium with fresh AraC-free NGB medium. Use a hot plate in a laminar air flow cell culture hood whose temperature is kept ready at 37 °C immediately before this procedure.\n\tNOTE: It is necessary to perform the medium changing as rapidly as possible on a hot plate to reduce the time that the cultures are at the outside of the CO2 incubator.\nKeep this neuron ball culture in the CO2 incubator for up to DIV 11.\n\tNOTE: At DIV 11-12, neuron balls extending neurites up to 1-2 mm are used for experiments.\n3. Applying LRRTM2 beads on neuron ball culture with or without cell bodies (DIV 11-12)\nNOTE: Before application of LRRTM2 beads on neuron ball culture, it is recommended to remove cell bodies. Therefore, prepare LRRTM2 beads at first, then remove the cell bodies and later apply LRRTM2 beads to culture as early as possible. Biotinylated LRRTM2 is provided by the Nogi’s group (Yokohama City University) as conditioned medium. They use an expression vector including biotin acceptor sequence and biotin ligase from E. coli (BirA)15,16 to attach biotin to LRRTM2, and the expression vector is transfected to Expi293F cells included in the Expi293 Expression System. The vector information is available in Supplementary Figure 1. Biotinylated LRRTM2-conjugated streptavidin beads reduced background of immunostaining greatly compared to LRRTM2-Fc –conjugated Protein A beads that are used for prototype LRRTM2 system8.\nPreparation of biotinylated LRRTM2 beads",
    "To remove excess biotin from conditioned medium of Expi293F cells expressing biotinylated LRRTM2, apply 1.7 mL of the conditioned medium mixed with 0.8 mL of PBS (total 2.5 mL) to PD-10 gel filtration column. PD-10 column is pre-equilibrated with 25 mL of ultrapure water and 25 mL of PBS.\nElute with 3.5 mL of PBS and collect the flow-through as a LRRTM2 stock.\n\t\tNOTE: This LRRTM2 stock can be dispensed to aliquots and stored at -80 °C for long-term. Expression levels of biotinylated LRRTM2 sometimes vary from lot to lot. Thus, proper volume of LRRTM2 stock to conjugate to the beads should be determined to form presynapses enough on neuron balls, when new lot of LRRTM2 stock is used at first time.\nTake 20 µL from the suspension of streptavidin-coated magnetic particles (diameter: 4-5 µm) to a microcentrifuge tube. Immobilize the beads to a handmade apparatus attached with neodymium permanent magnets and wash three times with 100 µL of PBS-MCBC in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: PBS-MCBC contains PBS including 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM CaCl2, 0.1% BSA, and 0.1% Complete EDTA-free.\nAfter removing completely PBS-MCBC from the beads, add predetermined volume of LRRTM2 stock (usually 500-1,000 µL, see Note 3.1.2) to the washed beads. Incubate the mixture using rotator at 4 °C for 1-2 h.\nWash the beads twice with 100 µL of PBS-MCBC, and later with 100 µL of NGB medium.\nResuspend the LRRTM2 beads in 50 µL of NGB medium for application to the neuron ball culture.\nUse same procedures for preparing the control beads (negative control) in another microcentrifuge tube except adding biotinylated-LRRTM2 proteins.\nRemoving cell bodies from neuron balls at DIV 11-12 and applying LRRTM2 beads\nLabel the wells of a 4-well plate as “Cell body (+)” and “Cell body (-)”.",
    "Cut the ending of a yellow tip at 45° angle with a razor blade previously sprayed with 70% ethanol under stereomicroscope (Figure 1B).\nPut the yellow tip end on the cell body area of a neuron ball and remove the cell bodies by suction (Figure 1B).\nTo identify each specified condition of the experiment, label the wells again as “LRRTM2 beads” and “Control beads”.\nApply the LRRTM2 and control beads on neuron ball culture, and submerge to the bottom of the plates for 1 min using ferrite magnets to start presynapse formation. This procedure ensures to touchdown all beads at the same time. Especially, it would be effective for short time incubation (e.g., 30 min and 1 h) with LRRTM2 beads synchronously.\nTo perform time-course experiments, label each separate well as 0 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 18 h and apply LRRTM2 beads at the indicated time intervals.\nAfter the addition of LRRTM2 beads, incubate the neuron ball culture with the beads for specified time (0 min to 18 h) to form presynapses.\n4. Immunostaining and microscopy\nNOTE: Fix the cells for 4 h via incubation with LRRTM2 beads in the experimental conditions with and without cell bodies, as the axons tend gradually to die in absence of cell bodies after 4 h. In case of time course with LRRTM2 beads, fix the cells at the indicated specified time.\nFixing and staining neurons in neuron ball culture after presynapse formation with LRRTM2 beads\nRemove NGB medium and fix the neuron balls with 4% PFA in PBS (250 µL/well) for 20 min at room temperature, and then wash with 500 µL of PBS 4-times each 5 min.",
    "Wash the fixed cells with TBS (Tris-buffered saline: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and 150 mM NaCl) for more than 5 min.\nPermeabilize the cells/axons of neuron ball culture with TBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min.\nKeep the cells 1 h for blocking with blocking buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% NGS (normal goat serum) in TBS).\nIncubate the cells with primary antibodies; anti-rabbit-vGlut1 (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (1:4000)) and anti-mouse-Munc18-1 (1:300) diluted with antibody diluent for overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the coverslips 4 times with immunofluorescence (IF) buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA in TBS) and incubate for 30 min with fluorophore (Alexa dye)-conjugated 2nd antibodies; anti-mouse-IgG-Alexa 555 (1:500), anti-rabbit-IgG-Alexa 488 (1:1000).\nStain the nuclei of the cell bodies of neurons for 5 min with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 µg/mL) in PBS.\nWash the coverslips three times with PBS and then mount on glass slides using mounting media containing 167 mg/mL poly (vinyl) alcohol and 6 mg/mL N-propyl gallate.\nStore the glass slides in a refrigerator at -20 °C until microscopy. Fluorescent signals of the glass slides are detectable for at least 1 year when the slides are stored at -20 °C.\nTaking images under fluorescence microscope\nCapture differential interference contrast and IF images under an inverted fluorescent microscope with a cooled CCD camera using 60X oil immersion lens. For image acquisition software, use a software installed microscope system. Use Image J as image analysis software.\nMeasure the IF intensity in presynapses in axon using following formula; IF intensities of Region of Interest on beads (ROI) – Off beads region intensity/Axonal intensity along 20 µm from beads – background intensity. This ratio intensity provides protein accumulation index (Figure 4A). Accomplish the measurements on original 16-bit images using Image J software.",
    "To quantify the accumulation level of particular protein in presynapse induced with LRRTM2 beads, always select the area away from 2-field of view or more apart from the cell body with microscope (60X).\n\t\tNOTE: The selection of area in neuron ball for imaging is crucial as dense axons are near the cell body and periphery of neuron ball can provide single axon.\nFor accurate measurement, choose 5-different axonal field (similar distance from cell bodies)/coverslip.\nKeep identical imaging conditions at different day and in between experiments\nSubscription Required.
