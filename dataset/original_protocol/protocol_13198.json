    "Rhodiola crenulata is collected from Zhuoda Snow Mountain, Ganzi County, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China (N 31.44570°, E 99.96086°, 4892 m). The plants are authenticated as genuine by Professor Yi Zhang at the School of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n1. Collection of Rhodiola crenulata\nPhotograph the habitat map of Rhodiola crenulata.\nPhotograph the whole plant, leaves, calyx, and rhizome of Rhodiola crenulata.\nUse a spade to clear the weeds and broken stones within 1 m of the Rhodiola crenulata to ensure the subsequent smooth mining.\nDig up the soil with a hoe until the whole rhizosphere is seen and collect the taproot.\n\tNOTE:The roots and rhizomes of Rhodiola crenulata used in medicinal parts should be collected in autumn, when the flower stems wither.\n2. Characteristic identification\nObserve the appearance traits of Rhodiola crenulata with the unaided eye: cylindrical and short taproots and rhizomes, brown surface, membranous yellow epidermis with a pink pattern, and orange-red or burgundy slices.\nIdentify it by smell: It gives a fragrant smell when near the nose.\nIdentify it by taste: Take a small piece of root into the mouth, first sip and then chew, taste slightly bitter, then sweet.\n3. Microscopic identification of starch granules in medicinal powder\nRemove the soil on the surface of the Rhodiola crenulata with a brush, put it in the oven at 40 °C, and turn the herbs every 24 h.\n\tNOTE: The ease of breaking of medicinal materials is considered the standard for drying moisture.\nPowder the dried medicinal materials using a powder machine and filter the medicinal powder using the medicated No. 3 sieve (see Table of Materials).",
    "Take a clean slide (see Table of Materials), dig the powder with a dissecting needle (see Table of Materials), and place it evenly at one-third of the slide within 2 mm.\nUse a glass dropper (see Table of Materials) to add a drop of deionized water to the powder. Use a tweezer (see Table of Materials) to hold one end of the cover glass (see Table of Materials) to touch the liquid level quickly and cover the powder.\n\tNOTE: Use an anatomical needle to gently mix water and medicinal powder to ensure uniform sample mixing. There should be no air bubbles between the slide, powder, and cover glass.\nOpen the microscope (see Table of Materials) and place the slide in step 3.4 onto the platform to secure it. Adjust the light source and the coarse focus spiral to see the powder. Adjust the fine parafocal spiral until the tissues are seen clearly. Switch to a 40x objective and observe the starch granules.\n\t​NOTE: Starch the grains presenting as single or multiple grains, and the umbilical point appears herringbone or crack-shaped.\n4. Microscopic identification of catheters, cork cells, fibers, wood parenchyma cells, and pigment masses in medicinal powder\nTake a clean slide (see Table of Materials), dig the powder with a dissecting needle (see Table of Materials), and place it at one-third of the slide.\nUse a glass dropper (see Table of Materials) to add a drop of chloral hydrate (see Table of Materials) to the powder. Take the slide with a tweezer (see Table of Materials) and heat it in the alcohol lamp three times, each time for 1 s.\n\tNOTE: Bubbles should be avoided during heating. The liquid remains non-flowing, indicating that the penetration is complete.",
    "Use a glass dropper to add a drop of glycerin (see Table of Materials). Use a tweezer to hold one end of the cover glass to touch the liquid level quickly.\nOpen the microscope and place the slide onto the platform to secure it. Adjust the light source and the coarse focus spiral to see the powder. Adjust the fine parafocal spiral until the tissues are seen clearly. Observe the catheter, cork cells, fibers, wood parenchyma cells, and pigment block by switching to a 40x objective lens.\n\t​NOTE: Polygonal or long polygonal of cork cells, spiral vessel with obvious helical structure, xylem parenchyma containing calcium oxalate sand crystals, and red or brownish-red pigment block.\n5. Preparation of thin layer chromatographic (TLC) samples of Rhodiola crenulata and its reference\nPlace the weighing paper on the balance (see Table of Materials) and weigh 3 g powder of Rhodiola crenulata.\nTake the powder into a 100 mL conical bottle (see Table of Materials), and add 25 mL of methanol with a big belly pipette (see Table of Materials). Put the conical bottle into the ultrasonic instrument. Set the power to 250 W, frequency to 40 kHz, and time to 30 min (see Table of Materials), and switch on the instrument.\n\tNOTE: The purpose of the ultrasound instrument is to ensure that the powder of Rhodiola crenulata is completely dissolved without affecting the results of subsequent thin-layer chromatographic experiments.\nRemove the conical bottle and rinse the outer bottle with running water to room temperature (RT).\nAspirate 800 µL of liquid prepared in step 5.3 with a 1 mL syringe. Filter with 0.22 µm microporous filter membrane (see Table of Materials) and collect 400 µL of midstream sample solution of Rhodiola crenulata in a chromatographic sample bottle.",
    "Weigh and add 2 mg of salidroside, tyrosol, and gallic acid (see Table of Materials) into 3 separate 100 mL conical bottles, respectively. Add 25 mL of methanol with a big belly pipette into every conical bottle.\nPut the conical bottle into the ultrasonic instrument, set the power to 250 W, frequency to 40 kHz, and time to 30 min, and repeat step 5.3 (see Table of Materials).\nAspirate 800 µL of liquid prepared in step 5.6 with a 1 mL syringe. Filter with 0.22 µm microporous filter membrane (see Table of Materials) and collect 400 µL of midstream salidroside, tyrosol, and gallic acid standard solution in corresponding chromatographic sample bottles.\n6. TLC identification\nPipette trichloromethane (5 mL), ethyl acetate (4 mL), methanol (2 mL), and formic acid (0.5 mL) (see Table of Materials). Add to one side of the double-tank chromatography cylinder (see Table of Materials), shake, and mix evenly. Cover the upper cylinder head.\nPlace the gallic acid, salidroside, tyrosol standard solution, and Rhodiola crenulata solution on the sample rack in positions A1-A4.\nPlace the 5 cm x 10 cm silicone sheet (see Table of Materials) on the sampling table. Start the automatic sampling machine (see Table of Materials), and open the air control valve.\nOpen the visionCATS software (see Table of Materials). Click New > New Folder (named Rhodiola crenulata sample test) > OK. Click New Method (name Rhodiola crenulata sample test) > OK > ATS 4.\nClick Finish Step Definition. Click Track Assignment to edit the description (gallic acid, salidroside, tyrosol, and Rhodiola crenulata sample).\nClick HPTLC Steps. Set the thin layer parameters (5 cm x 10 cm). Select Application Type (band), set the parameters (Table 1), and click the OK button.",
    "Open Filling/Rinsing Quality. Check Fill only Programmed Volume. Set the vial bottom level (mm) to 0.5, and click the OK button.\nClick Execute Method.\nClick the Track Assignment button, check Center, and set the parameters (Table 2).\nClick the Continue button for automatic sampling.\nTurn off the automatic sampling machine and air valve. Remove the silicone sheet from the automatic sampling machine.\nPut the silicone sheet into the other side of the double tank chromatography cylinder in step 6.1, cover the upper cylinder head, and pre-saturate for 20 min.\nGently clamp the upper end of the thin layer plate with a tweezer, quickly put the silicone sheet into the development agent, and cover the upper cylinder head.\n\tNOTE: Take out the silicone sheet when the unfolding front edge is 0.5-1.0 cm away from the upper end of the thin layer plate.\nAfter the organic solvent evaporates, spray the chromogenic solution onto the surface of the silicone sheet at room temperature to obtain chromogenic results.\n\tNOTE: The chromogenic solution is an aqueous solution containing 2% FeCl3 and 1% K3[Fe(CN)6].\nSubscription Required.
