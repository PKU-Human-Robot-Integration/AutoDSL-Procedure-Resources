It is important to use fresh forceps and scissors between steps to prevent contamination.\nEuthanize an E18 timed-pregnant rat using methods outlined in an institution-approved protocol, such as CO2 euthanasia or decapitation.\nSpray the ventral area of the female rat with 70% ethanol and make a transverse incision between the dermal layer and abdominal fascia.\nUsing the scissors and forceps, separate the layers and cut to expose the abdominal fascia (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2189-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation and hippocampal dissection of E18 rat embryos\n(A) Euthanized and decapitated E18 timed-pregnant rat with the abdominal fascia exposed.\n(B) Incision to open the abdominal cavity to expose the uterus.\n(C) Removing the uterus containing the prenatal pups.\n(D) Lateral cut to remove the head. Scale bar, 1 cm.\n(E) Incision to the mid-sagittal plane of the skull to expose the brain. Scale bar, 0.5 cm.\n(F) E18 brain with intact hemispheres; brain stem was removed. Scale bar, 0.25 cm.\n(G) Right and left hemispheres of the brain. The meninges are removed from the hemisphere on the left but not the right. Scale bar, 0.25 cm.\n(H) Interior of the brain with the hippocampus outlined in black. Scale bar, 0.25 cm.\n(I) Dissected hippocampus (see arrow). Scale bar, 0.25 cm.\nUsing a fresh pair of scissors and forceps, make an incision to open the abdomen and cut to expose the abdominal cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nUsing a fresh pair of scissors and forceps, remove the uterus and place it in a 15 cm dish containing ice-cold HBSS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: Use fresh pairs of scissors and forceps to prevent contamination (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).",
    "Remove the embryos from the uterus and place them into a 10 cm dish that contains ice-cold HBSS.\nSeparate and place the heads into a new 10 cm dish that has ice-cold HBSS (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). Keep the plate on ice.\nNote: Placing the specimen into new HBSS helps wash away residue and blood.\nNote: Make an even and straight cut when separating the head. This step is vital as the head must balance on the cut surface.\nHippocampal dissection\nTiming: 60 min\nThis section details the careful removal of hippocampi from dissected E18 rat embryo brains. The dissection should be performed efficiently under a stereo or dissecting microscope. Minimizing time spent dissecting the hippocampi will produce higher yields of viable cells.\nPlace cold HBSS into the lid of a 10 cm dish and add the embryo heads.\nWith the head in the prone position, make an incision into the mid-sagittal plane of the head from posterior to anterior using vannas scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nPeel back the cranium. Using a closed pair of vannas scissors, gently scoop under the brain in an anterior to posterior direction to remove it from the skull. Cut the brain stem to separate the brain (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nMake a sagittal cut to separate the right and left hemispheres.\nRemove the meninges from the brain’s surface using two fine-pointed forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). The meninges contain blood vessels, making them appear red in color. It is easiest to remove starting from the exterior, working towards the brain’s interior.\nWith the interior hemisphere facing up, remove the hippocampus using vannas scissors. The hippocampus is located below the cortex and appears dark and moon-shaped (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H and 1I).\nUse a P1000 pipette to transfer hippocampi to the 15 mL conical containing ice-cold HBSS.",
    "Note: It is fastest to work in batches of 4–6 brains, completing the same step for each brain before proceeding to the next step (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nNote: It is essential to use ice-cold HBSS. The tissue becomes tacky, fragile, and challenging to work with when warm.\nHippocampal tissue dissociation and plating\nTiming: 6 h\nThis section contains steps for the trypsinization and trituration of hippocampi. Once the tissue is dissociated, cells are plated on the glass surface of PLL-coated imaging dishes. These steps should be performed in a Biosafety cabinet.\nRemove HBSS from the 15 mL conical with a serological pipet. Try not to disturb the hippocampi.\nAdd 4.5 mL of warm HBSS and 0.5 mL of 2.5% trypsin. Invert the conical once and incubate in a 37°C water bath for 10 min.\nStop digestion by removing the trypsin solution using a 10 mL serological pipet.\nAdd 10 mL of warmed AM, allow hippocampi to settle (approximately 30 s), and remove media using a 10 mL serological pipet.\nRepeat step 18 two more times.\nAdd 1 mL of AM and triturate tissue with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Try not to introduce air bubbles. Proceed until the media is cloudy and tissue pieces are no longer visible (∼10–20 times).\nNote: Fire-polished Pasteur pipettes have smoother edges and a narrowed tip which help break up tissue more efficiently while reducing cell damage.\nDilute 10 μL of cell suspension with 10 μL of 0.4% Trypan Blue Stain. Determine the cell viability and count using an automated counter.\nAlternatives: The cell count can also be determined using a hemacytometer.\nCritical: Trypan blue is a carcinogen and may cause cancer. Wear appropriate PPE when working with the solution.",
    "Plate 1.25 × 105 cells onto the pre-coated/washed glass surface of 35 mm MatTek dishes containing warmed AM. Add dropwise, covering the entire glass surface.\nKeep cultures at 5% CO2 and 37°C for ∼2–5 h to provide adequate time for cells to settle and attach to the glass surface.\nEnsure cells have adhered through visual inspection using a light microscope. Upon confirmation, replace media with MM and maintain cultures at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nMaintaining hippocampal cultures\nTiming: 6 d\nHippocampal cultures are maintained by performing media exchanges every few days. In addition, AraC is added to reduce non-neuronal cell growth the day after plating. These steps should be performed in the Biosafety cabinet.\nThe day after plating, or 1 day in vitro (DIV), add 1 μM AraC to cultures to prevent the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. It is best to dilute AraC in a small amount of MM (∼200 μL) and add it dropwise to the dish. Gently mix to ensure there is an even distribution of AraC.\nNote: Adding AraC the day after plating reduces the number of non-neuronal cells without affecting neuronal growth or survival. If performing studies on aged cultures, it is best to continue adding AraC during feedings.\nEvery 3–4 days, replace ¼ of culture media with equilibrated MM (i.e., media that has been warmed to 37°C and equilibrated to 5% CO2 for a minimum of 30 min).\nNote: Neurons are sensitive. Minimize stress by working quickly when handling cells outside the CO2 incubator (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nTransient transfection of cultured neurons\nTiming: 2 h\nLipofectamine 2000 is used to transiently transfect DNA plasmids. All transfection steps must be performed in the Biosafety cabinet.\nAt 6 DIV, check the quality of neuron cultures to ensure viability for transfection (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2189-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Micrograph of primary hippocampal neurons\n(A–C) Representative images of primary hippocampal neurons at one (A), four (B), and seven (C) DIV. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nFor each imaging dish, remove and save media for later use. Replace with fresh equilibrated MM.\nFor each transfection, prepare two separate mixtures in sterile microcentrifuge tubes and incubate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 5 min (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2189-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Mitochondrial damage and SNAP pulse-chase paradigm\n(A) Schematic of plasmids used to transiently transfect primary hippocampal cultures.\n(B) Schematic of mitochondrial damage. Antioxidant deprivation initiates mitochondrial damage and fragmentation. OPTN is recruited to damaged mitochondria and facilitates engulfment into an autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome for downstream acidification to degrade the damaged organelle fully.\n(C and D) Timeline (C) and schematic (D) of the mitochondrial pulse-chase experiment. The day after transfection, mitochondria are damaged for 6 h and labeled with the first SNAP pulse (“Old” Mito, magenta). Next, a non-fluorescent SNAP Block was added for 2 h to saturate the remaining SNAP binding sites, and neurons were left for ∼16 h. Before imaging, a second SNAP pulse (“Young” Mito, green) was performed.\n(E) Representative images of “Old” and “Young” mitochondrial populations. The dynamic mitochondrial network is dual labeled (white). Scale bar, 5 μm.\nTube 1: 150 μL Neurobasal media and DNA (0.35 μg Mito-SNAP, 0.4 μg Halo-OPTN, and 0.4 μg LAMP1-EGFP). Mito, sequence from COX8; OPTN, Optineurin; LAMP1, Lysosome Associated Membrane Protein 1.\nTube 2: 150 μL Neurobasal media and 4 μL Lipofectamine 2000.\nNote: According to the manufacturer[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FLipofectamine_2000_Reag_protocol.pdf], DNA-Lipofectamine complexes can be added to the culture medium in the presence or absence of serum/antibiotics. The manufacturer recommends using Opti-MEM Reduced Serum media for transient transfections. However, we found no difference in the transfection efficiency using Neurobasal media.",
    "Note: Use an endotoxin-free DNA Maxi Kit to prepare concentrated and high-quality DNA plasmids. If dissolving plasmids in TAE, be cautious when working with low DNA concentrations, as too much EDTA can decrease transfection efficiency.\nAdd Tube 2 to Tube 1, gently mix by pipetting, and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 20 min.\nNote: The manufacturer recommends adding Tube 1 to Tube 2 and incubating for 5 min. We found no difference in the transfection efficiency using our method. In addition, the increased incubation time allows for more DNA-Lipofectamine complexes to form.\nAdd transfection complexes dropwise to neuron cultures and incubate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 45 min.\nDuring the incubation, add equal parts of saved media from step 28 with fresh MM and equilibrate at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nAfter 45 min, replace the neurons’ media with the conditioned media from step 32.\nNote: Transient transfection should be completed ∼18 h before pulse-chase labeling (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nMitochondrial damage and SNAP pulse-chase labeling assays\nTiming: 2 d",
    "Within this protocol, mitochondrial damage is induced via antioxidant deprivation using the AOF MM, which initiates mild oxidative stress and results in low levels of mitochondrial damage. Mitochondria are damaged for 6 h while SNAP and Halo labeling typically require 1 h (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C–3E; troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]). Thus, labeling occurs during the final hour of the damaging incubation period. The ligand is added for 30 min, followed by two quick washes and a 30-min washout. The first SNAP pulse identifies “Old” mitochondria, while the second SNAP pulse labels “Young” mitochondria (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D). For SNAP-Cell Block, the ligand is added for 120 min, followed by two quick washes and a 30-min washout. To complete all required washes, it is necessary to warm ample media to 37°C in the 5% CO2 incubator. Mitochondrial damaging and pulse-chase labeling assays must be performed in the Biosafety cabinet.\n18–24 h after transfection, remove media from each imaging dish and reserve for later. Save media separately in sterile microcentrifuge tubes.\nMitochondrial-damaging assay.\nFor each experimental plate, induce mitochondrial damage by adding 2 mL of AOF MM. For the control condition, add 2 mL of regular MM.\nPlace in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 6 h.\n1st SNAP pulse.\nDuring the final hour of the mitochondrial-damaging assay, add 100 nM of SNAP JF549cp and 100 nM of Halo JF646x ligands to each plate. Thoroughly mix and incubate for 30 min in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nWash plates twice with 2 mL of media. Add 2 mL of media and place dishes back in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for a final 30-min washout.\nWash with AOF MM for treated plates and regular MM for control plates.\nEnd mitochondrial-damaging assay and 1st SNAP pulse.",
    "After 6 h treatment, aspirate AOF MM and add 2 mL of regular MM. Perform the same steps with the control plate for consistency, removing media and adding 2 mL of MM.\nSNAP Block.\nAdd 1 μM of SNAP-Cell Block to each plate and thoroughly mix.\nIncubate for 120 min in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.\nWash plates twice with 2 mL of MM. Add 2 mL of MM and place the dishes back in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for a final 30-min washout.\nNote: SNAP-Cell Block is a membrane-permeable SNAP ligand that does not fluoresce. This step is necessary to saturate the remaining SNAP binding sites following the 1st SNAP pulse.\nAdd conditioned media from step 34 back to imaging dishes and place in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for ∼16 h.\n2nd SNAP Pulse.\n23 h after beginning the mitochondrial-damaging assay, add 1 μM of SNAP-Cell 430 ligand.\nNote: SNAP-Cell 430 is a costly reagent. To be consistent with the 2 mL volume used in the first SNAP pulse, 4 μL of SNAP-Cell 430 are required. Alternatively, dilute 1 μL SNAP-Cell 430 in 500 μL of MM. Be sure the neurons are entirely covered with media, as low liquid volumes could affect the relative oxygen tension (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nIncubate for 30 min in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.\nWash plates twice with 2 mL of MM. Add 2 mL of MM and place the dishes back in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for a final 30-min washout.\nAspirate media and add 2 mL of MM. Cells are now ready for imaging; this should be 24 h after initiating mitochondrial damage.",
    "Alternatives: A selection of SNAP and Halo fluorescent labels are available. The ligands used here could be substituted based on experimental conditions and microscope laser line setup.\nLive-cell confocal imaging\nTiming: 2–3 h\nBefore imaging, turn on the temperature and CO2 controller and allow conditions to stabilize (∼1 h). If using a microscope with a 5% CO2 environmental chamber, image neurons in MM; if not, use a media that can maintain cells in ambient CO2, such as Hibernate E Low Fluorescence by BrainBits supplemented with B27. When performing quantitative live-cell imaging, design appropriate configurations where all channels have good signal-to-noise and avoid pixel saturation, fluorophore crosstalk, and accidental FRET.\nLaser-scanning confocal setup using a Leica STELLARIS 8 equipped with a 63×/1.40 oil objective and LAS X Software (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2189-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Live-cell confocal imaging was used to take a Z-stack through the soma of a primary hippocampal neuron. Scale bar, 5 μm.\nQuantitative data analysis\nTiming: 2 h\nWe use spectrally distinct fluorophores to identify “Old” and “Young” mitochondria. To distinguish between these two populations, it is essential to note which channel corresponds to each fluorophore when analyzing the data. The “Rectangle” and “Line” functions in Fiji are used to identify OPTN-positive “Old” mitochondria and quantify the fluorescence intensity.\nOpen image files in Fiji.",

    "Once a clear, well-defined event has been identified, use the “Rectangle” function to draw a box. Create an overlay specific to the Z-stack slice. Only mark events that are OPTN-positive “Old” Mito-SNAP for further analysis; omit OPTN events that are dual labeled with “Young” and “Old” Mito-SNAP.\nNote: Use the “Channels Tool” and “Brightness & Contrast Tool” to help adjust the brightness, toggle between channels to identify events, and view multiple Z-planes around the OPTN ring for confirmation.\nSave each image file after visualizing all events in the cell.\nDetermine whether OPTN events containing “Old” mitochondria are positive or negative for LAMP1.\nUse the “Channels Tool” to visualize “Old” Mito-SNAP (SNAP JF549cp), Halo-OPTN (Halo JF646x), and LAMP1-EGFP channels.\nUse the boxes created in step 47 to locate OPTN ring events.\nScore OPTN-positive “Old” mitochondria for the presence or absence of LAMP1-EGFP.\nLAMP1-positive events: colocalization of LAMP1-EGFP with Halo-OPTN, visualized as overlapping rings in a single Z-plane.
