    "1. Preparation of Cardiomyocytes\nGenerate and culture human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) on 6-well plates coated with basement membrane matrix as described10.\nDifferentiate hiPSCs into hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) using previously described methods11,12.\nOn Day 19 after differentiation, isolate the cardiomyocytes using 2 mL of Trypsin/EDTA 0.05% in each well for 5 min at room temperature.\nMonitor the cardiomyocytes under an optical microscope to watch for cell dissociation.\nNeutralize Trypsin using 2 mL of Trypsin inhibitor 0.0125%.\nPool the isolated cardiomyocytes and transfer them into one 50 mL conical tube using a motorized pipette filler.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 250 x g at room temperature to obtain a pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 5 mL of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) cell media supplemented with B-27 (RPMI/B-27 cell media).\nPipette 20 µL of cells in cell media and stain with an equal amount of 0.4% Trypan Blue solution.\nUse an automated cell counter or a manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the concentration and cell viability of the cell suspension.\n2. Preparation of Fibroblasts\nInitiate the human cardiac fibroblast (HCF) (adult ventricular type) cell line13.\nPassage and isolate them in accordance to HCF culturing protocols13.\nPipette 20 µL of cells in cell media and stain with an equal amount of Trypan Blue solution 0.4%.\nUse an automated cell counter or a manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the concentration and cell viability of the new cell suspension.\n3. Preparation of Endothelial Cells\nInitiate the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line as described14. Passage and isolate them in accordance to HUVEC culturing protocols as described14.\nPipette 20 µL of cells in cell media and stain with an equal amount of 0.4% Trypan Blue solution.",
    "Use an automated cell counter or a manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the concentration and cell viability of the cell suspension.\n4. Co-culture:\nMix the three cell types (hiPSC-CM, HCFs, and HUVECs) in RPMI/B-27 cell media to generate a stock of mixed cell solution in a 50 mL conical tube, at a hiPSC-CM:HCF:HUVEC cell ratio of 70:15:15 and concentration of 165,000 cells per mL.\nDistribute the mixed cell solution into ultra-low attachment 96-well U-bottom plates at 200 µL per well, or 33,000 cells per well, using a multi-channel pipette.\nIncubate the 96-well plates for 3 days (37°C, 5% carbon dioxide, 95% humidity).\nInspect for the presence of mixed cell multicellular spheroids at the center and bottom of individual wells, under light microscopy.\n\tNOTE: In a two-dimensional microscopic projection, these spheroids will appear circular in shape (Figure 1). Spheroids should form within 24 h, after cell seeding into ultra-low attachment 96-well plates. Spheroids should start beating within 48 h, after cell seeding into 96-well plates. Spheroids that are not beating should not be used for 3D bioprinting to ensure that the final 3D bioprinted cardiac patch is functional. Immunofluorescence of spheroids for connexin 43 (Cx43) and troponin may be used to assess spheroid cellular composition and quality15.\n5. 3D Bioprinting of Scaffold-free Cardiac Tissues\nLoad the plates containing the spheroids into the magazines of the scaffold-free spheroid-based 3D bioprinter.\nTurn on the 3D bioprinter and execute the 3D bioprinting software.\nClick \"Auxillary\", \"Operation Preparation\", \"Inspect Mode\", and then \"Home Return\".\nClick the green icon under \"Start\" to begin spheroid inspection.\nWatch for the spheroid diameters to appear under the column \"(2) Dia (µm)\" on the screen.",
    "To estimate the average spheroid diameter to the nearest 100 µm, click \"Initial settings\" and enter the average spheroid diameter into Stack Z pitch (µm).\nClick \"Total\", the number under \"Layers\" should readjust automatically. Click \"Apply\" to confirm the settings.\nClick \"Needle Array Map\", go to \"Layer No.\", select the desired layer for 3D bioprinting, and draw the desired 3D bioprinting design on the map on the left of the screen by selecting individual spheroid positions. Click \"Apply\" to confirm the 3D bioprinting design.\nClick \"Needle Array Check\" to begin needle array inspection. If the needle array is out of focus, input values into \"OffsetZ (µm)\", ranging from 0 to 500 µm to adjust camera focus, starting with 500 µm and decreasing by 100 µm to 0 µm.\nClick \"Inspection Parameters\", \"Type 1\", and set \"Diameter (µm)\" to the desired diameter range. Set \"Roundness (%)\" and \"Smoothness (%)\" to desired percentages. Click \"Apply\" to confirm the settings.\n\tNOTE: Here the spheroid diameters were set from 450 µm to 550 µm. \"Roundness (%)\" and \"Smoothness (%)\" are computer calculated assessment of each individual spheroid. Here, the settings used for \"Roundness (%)\" is 60% and \"Smoothness (%)\" is 70%.\nClick \"Presence\" and update the \"Diameter (µm)\" to the same settings in the previous step. Click \"Apply\" to confirm the settings.\nClick \"Stack Mode\", then the green icon under \"Start\" to begin spheroid pick up using the nozzle of the 3D bioprinter by vacuum suction, and placement of spheroids in specific locations in a needle array.\n\tNOTE: For a cardiac patch consisting of 81 spheroids (9 spheroids x 9 spheroids), 3D bioprinting should take about 20 to 30 min.",
    "After bioprinting, using sterile forceps, pick up the needle array containing the 3D bioprinted patch and transfer it into a 250 mL sterile beaker containing 150 mL of RPMI/B-27 cell media.\nIncubate the 3D bioprinted patch with the needle array for 3 days (37°C, 5% carbon dioxide, 95% humidity).\n6. Removal of 3D Bioprinted Patch from the Needle Array and Patch Maturation\nAfter 3 days of incubation, with one hand at the base of the needle array and the other on the plastic cover under the patch, gently slide the plastic cover upwards to remove the 3D bioprinted patch from the needle array.\n\tNOTE: Lubrication with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) may be applied to the needles just before this step, as needed, for smoother and easier removal.\nUsing a pair of sterile forceps, pick up the plastic cover with the 3D bioprinted patch on top of it and transfer the patch and plastic cover into a 35 mm dish containing RPMI/B-27 cell media.\nGently shake the plastic cover with the patch in the RPMI/B-27 cell media, with the forceps still holding on to the plastic cover, to release the patch into the media.\nInspect the 3D bioprinted patch under light microscopy to visualize whether it is beating to ensure that the 3D bioprinted patch is functional.\nIncubate the 3D bioprinted patch in the 35 mm dish for 3 days or longer (37°C, 5% carbon dioxide, 95% humidity).\n\tNOTE: After 3 days, the spheroids fuse together and the holes in the patch, where the needles were, should no longer be visible.\nSubscription Required.
