    "NOTE: Blood samples were obtained from NIH blood bank (IRB approved protocol: 99-CC-0168).\n1. Blood Sample Preparation\nNOTE: To avoid platelet activation, draw blood slowly and mix gently with citrate by inverting the tube several times.\nPlatelet-rich plasma (PRP) preparation\nDraw 30–50 mL of blood using a 20 G or larger diameter needle and add into a tube containing sodium citrate (3.8%) in a 1:9 ratio or acid citrate dextrose (ACD) (85 mM trisodium citrate, 66.6 mM citric acid, 111 mM glucose, pH 4.5) in a 1:6 ratio.\nAliquot 5 mL of freshly collected whole blood into empty 15-mL conical tubes. Centrifuge whole blood at 120 x g for 10 min at room temperature.\nCarefully collect the supernatant containing the platelets (platelet-rich plasma, PRP) from the upper portion by a plastic transfer pipette.\nNOTE: PRP from Step 1.1.3 is ready for use in experiments or for further processing to prepare washed platelets. The soft pellet obtained after centrifugation (Step 1.1.2) contains red blood cells and white cells and can be further purified to obtain washed red blood cells (RBC) — see Step 1.3. The experiment needs to be finished within 2 h after drawing blood. When collecting PRP (supernatant), avoid the collection of buffy coat-containing leukocytes accumulated on the PRP/RBC interface.\nWashed platelet preparation (optional)\nCentrifuge collected PRP at 400 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and keep the platelet pellets.\nGently wash the pellets by adding 5 mL of CGS buffer (120 mM NaCl, 12.9 mM trisodium citrate and 30 mM glucose, pH 6.5) and centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Resuspend the platelet pellets with 3 mL of modified Tyrode buffer (134 mM NaCl, 0.34 mM NaH2PO4, 2.9 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose pH 7.4).\nDilute the platelets (1:100 — as example, 10 µL of platelets in 990 µL of Rees-Ecker solution) with Rees Ecker solution and count by hemocytometer.\nAdjust the density of platelets to 3 x 108 cells/mL by adding Tyrode buffer.\nIncubate the platelet suspension at 37 °C for 1 h before starting the experiment.\nNOTE: Washed platelets are stable for 5–8 h at 37 °C.\nPreparation of washed red blood cells (RBC)\nAfter the collection, centrifuge the soft pellet obtained in Step 1.1.3 at 2,500 x g for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the RBC pellet with 5 mL of PBS by centrifugation at 2,500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat this step for 3 times.\nDiscard the PBS and use washed RBCs for further experiments.\n2. Deoxygenation\nAdd 1 mL of the mixture of PRP (prepared in Step 1.1.4. or 1.2.4.) and RBCs (prepared in Step 1.3.) at the desired hematocrit into a polypropylene bottle closed with a rubber stopper. For example, at 20% hematocrit, add 200 µL of RBCs to 800 µL of PRP.\nNOTE: Suggested hematocrits are from 0% up to 40%. Do not use a glass bottle or flask as platelets adhere to glass surface.\nInsert the needle connected to helium gas tank into the closed bottle and make the gas outlet by inserting a 26 G needle (Figure 1).\nSlowly swirl the bottle at room temperature.",
    "NOTE: Do not allow He gas to bubble through blood preparation. Slow gas flow is preferable for this procedure, and excessively fast He gas flow leads to increased hemolysis. The most efficient gas flow needs to be determined by trial, as it highly depends on the geometry of the experimental setup.\nPeriodically follow the deoxygenation process by measuring the partial oxygen pressure (pO2) using a CO-oximeter.\nNOTE: In our hands, 10 min of deoxygenation decreases pO2 to 25 mmHg which is required for nitrite reduction by RBCs. Continuing deoxygenation did further reduce pO2 to 10 mmHg; however, it led to increased hemolysis and increases in cell-free hemoglobin (Figure 2).\n3. Red Blood Cell Nitrite Reduction\nAdd 1 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) into 0.0345 g of NaNO2 to make 500 mM stock solution of nitrite. Dilute 500 mM NaNO2 to 250 µM NaNO2 (25x) by serial dilution in PBS (pH 7.4).\nUsing a microsyringe, inject nitrite (40 µL) through the septum into the deoxygenated sample of PRP and RBCs to achieve final concentrations of 10 µM in total 1 mL of sample.\nNOTE: In this experiment, the final concentrations of nitrite used is 10 µM.\nIncubate the sample at 37 °C for 10 min or longer.\nNOTE: Adjust the exact duration of RBC incubation with nitrite needed for maximal nitrite reduction for different type of experiments.\nRemove the stopper and pipette 1 mL of the sample into a microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 3 min at room temperature.\nPipette 300 µL of the platelet suspension from the upper portion of the supernatant and mix with ACD (pH 6.5) in a 1:9 ratio. Discard the RBC pellet.\nCentrifuge the platelet suspension at 500 x g for 4 min at room temperature.",
    "Add 80 µL of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 0.5% NP-40, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor cocktail III (1:500) to the platelet pellets.\n4. Western Blotting of VASP\nLoad 15 µg of the protein from each sample to 2 separate 10% SDS-PAGE gels.\nNOTE: Harsh stripping buffer, which contains b-mercaptoethanol, cannot remove P-VASPSer239 and VASP antibodies from the membrane; therefore, P-VASP Ser239 and VASP should be run separately.\nRun the gels at 120 V for 1.30 h and transfer to the nitrocellulose membrane.\nBlock non-specific binding with 5% non-fat dry milk.\nIncubate the membrane with P-VASPSer239 (1:500), VASP (1:1,000) and GAPDH (1:1,000) for overnight at 4 °C.\nIncubate horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibody with the membrane for 45 min at room temperature.\nExpose the membrane with an imager machine and quantify the band density using ImageJ.\nSubscription Required.
