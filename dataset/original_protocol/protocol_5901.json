    "Note: HeLa cells and bacteria should be handled under a sterile laminar BSL-II hood, unless otherwise mentioned. This protocol describes fluorophore-expressing Salmonella infection of HeLa cells but can be adapted for other cell lines and pathogens. In particular, non-fluorescent pathogens can also be labeled by immunofluorescence. Culture of bacteria 2 days before infectionTake out a vial of glycerol stock of the bacteria SL1344-pGG2 (dsRed) and SL1344-pM965 (GFP) stored at -80 °C.Strike the bacteria on an LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotics (here ampicillin) to allow the formation of single colonies with both strains.Incubate the bacteria at 37 °C overnight.The next day, store the plate at 4 °C. The Petri dishes can be kept up to one week (Figure 1, see Note 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912225719_0370.jpgFigure 1. Bacterial culture on Petri dish. SL1344-pGG2 (dsRed) and SL1344-pM965 (GFP) are struck on a Petri dish containing the antibiotics (ampicillin). Individual colonies are circled in grey.Culture of bacteria 1 day before infectionFill two Falcon 14 ml polypropylene round-bottom tubes with 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 0.3 M NaCl and ampicillin at 50 μg/ml.Pick 3 colonies of one strain from the Petri dish using the same inoculation loop and add them into a first tube. Repeat this step with the second strain in a second tube.Incubate at 37 °C under agitation (220 rpm) in a 45°-tilted rack overnight (see Note 2).Culture of cells 1 day before infectionUse a water-bath to pre-warm the medium (trypsin, DMEM + 10% FBS, DPBS 1x) at 37 °C.Take a tissue culture flask of 75 cm2 containing HeLa cells at about 80% confluency based on microscopic observation of the cell density.Wash the cells with 5 ml of warm PBS 1x.Add 5 ml of warm 0.",
    "05% trypsin-EDTA and incubate the cells for 5 min in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Detach the remaining attached cells by carefully hitting the flask on the side and moving the medium along the surface of the flask.Check the efficiency of the trypsin action under the microscope: the cells should be round and fully detached from the surface of the flask. Incubate longer if necessary.Stop the trypsin action by adding 5 ml DMEM + 10% FBS.Resuspend the cells and transfer all the content of the flask into a 15 ml Falcon® tube.Centrifuge the cells for 4 min at 200 x g using Centrifuge 5810/5810 R (see Note 3).Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellet in warm DMEM + 10% FBS medium.Transfer 15 μl of the cell suspension into a cell counter chamber.Count the cells in the cell counter chamber using a bench microscope and a cell counter.Calculate the initial cell concentration (Ci).Calculate the volume of cells needed (Vi) to obtain a final concentration (Cf) of 1.5 x 104 cells/ml in a final volume (Vf) of 2 ml. Use the following formula: Vi = Cf x Vf/CiDilute the cells in DMEM + 10% FBS medium in a new Falcon® tube.Take a 96-well cell culture microplate and label the plate map. In the following part of the protocol, we consider using 16 wells of the plate (see Note 4, Figure 2).Add 100 μl of the cell dilution per well.Add 100 μl of PBS (1x) in the wells surrounding the cells (see Note 4, Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912225735_5848.jpgFigure 2. Cell culture in 96-well plate. The cells occupy the wells B2 to B9 and C2 to C9. The surrounding wells are filled with PBS 1x (see Note 4).Keep the 96-well plate in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.",
    "InfectionMake a subculture for each bacterial strain by diluting 150 μl of the overnight bacterial culture in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 0.3 M NaCl and 50 μg/ml ampicillin (dilution 1:21).Incubate the subcultures for 3 h in a 45°-tilted rack of an incubator at 37 °C with an orbital shaker at 220 rpm (see Note 5). Important: Steps D1 and D2 should be repeated 3 h later to prepare the subculture necessary for the second infection. Under a laminar hood, prepare 4 ml of “Gent100” solution containing EM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamicin at 100 μg/ml. Note: Mix 400 μl of FBS with 8 μl of gentamicin at 50 mg/ml and complete with 3,592 μl of EM. Under a laminar hood, prepare 2 ml of “Gent10” solution containing EM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamicin at 10 μg/ml. Note: Mix 200 μl of FBS with 0.8 μl of gentamicin at 50 mg/ml and complete with 1,799.2 μl of EM. Use the water-bath to prewarm the EM medium, the Gent100 and Gent10 solutions to 37 °C.Use the thermomixer to pre-warm four empty Eppendorf tubes at 37 °C.At the end of the 3 h of incubation, dilute 100 μl of the bacterial subculture in 400 μl of LB medium (volume final 500 μl, dilution 1:5), transfer the dilutions into two semi-micro disposable cuvettes, seal them with parafilm and measure the OD using the photometer. The OD of the dilutions should be around 0.4, corresponding to the late log phase of the bacterial growth.Prepare the HeLa cells for the infection by removing the DMEM + 10% FBS medium from the cell wells and add 100 μl of EM medium per well. Keep the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 until the infection.",
    "Transfer 500 μl of the two bacterial subculture from Step D2 into warmed one empty Eppendorf tube each.Centrifuge the Eppendorf tubes using Centrifuge 5424/5424 R for 1 min, at 7,600 x g.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 500 μl warm EM medium.Centrifuge again the Eppendorf tubes (washing step) for 1 min, at 7,600 x g.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 500 μl warm EM.Dilute 100 μl of the bacterial suspension in 400 μl of EM medium (final volume 500 μl, dilution 1:5). Transfer the dilutions into two semi-micro disposable cuvettes and measure the OD using the photometer.Calculate the dilution for a final multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 30, using the following calculation method:Wanted concentration of bacteria (Cf):30 x (3.5 x 104 cells/well) = 1.05 x 106 bacteria/well                                             = 1.05 x 107 bacteria/mlInitial volume to collect (Vi) for a final volume (Vf) of 0.5 ml:Vi = (Cf x Vf)/CiVi = (1.05 x 107 x 0.5)/(OD x 5 x 109)Prepare the two dilutions in the two remaining empty warm Eppendorf tubes for SL1344-pGG2 (dsRed) and SL1344-pM965 (GFP) completing the volume with warm EM (see Note 6).Remove the medium from each well of the 96-well plate using the multichannel pipette.Add 50 μl of the bacterial dilution into each well according to the map of the plate (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912225753_7898.jpgFigure 3. Infection map of a 96-well plate. First round of infection.Incubate the 96-well plate for 30 min in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Using the multichannel pipette and the pipetting reservoir, wash each well 3 times using 100 μl of warm EM each (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912225808_2133.jpgFigure 4.

    "Incubate the cells for 1 h in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Change the medium to 100 μl of Gent10 solution in each well (see Note 7).Incubate the cells for 1 h in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Wash the cells twice each with 100 μl of warm EM medium to remove the remaining gentamicin.Proceed to the second infection following the Steps D6 to D22 and using the second infection map (Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912225825_0364.jpgFigure 5. Infection map of a 96-well plate. Second round of infection.Fixation (under fume hood)Prepare 700 μl of 4% PFA by diluting the 16% PFA in DPBS 1x.Remove the medium from each well of the 96-well plate and add 40 μl of 4% PFA into each well.Incubate the plate for 15 min at room temperature (RT). From this step, protect the plate from light using aluminum foil.Remove the PFA and wash 3 times each with 100 μl of DPBS using the multichannel pipette and pipetting reservoir.StainingDilute CellMask at 1:1,000 and DAPI at 1:1,000 in 1 ml of DPBS to make a “staining mix”.Add 40 μl of the staining mix per well and incubate for 20 min at RT.Wash the wells 3 times with 100 μl of DPBS using the multichannel pipette and the pipetting reservoir.Keep the plate at 4 °C with 100 μl of DPBS per well, protected from light (with an aluminum foil) until acquisition at the microscope (see Note 8).Automatic microscopic image acquisitionAcquire the images of the 96-well plate using the Nikon inverted widefield microscope equipped with a 20x/0.5NA air objective, and the NIS software.Using JOBS Explorer, set an automatic acquisition pipeline such as presented in Figures 6 to 12:Give a name to the pipeline and select the type of storage as .nd2 (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180912/20180912225839_3179.jpgFigure 6.
