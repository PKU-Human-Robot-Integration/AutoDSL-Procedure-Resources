    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCompresstome preparation\nTiming: 30 min\nTo ensure consistency, explant slices are cut using a Precisionary Compresstome, which facilitates even, smooth sectioning of the tissue. The steps described below prepare the instrument for use.\nNote: Leave the sharp blade edge wrapped in wax-paper wrapper and use forceps while preparing the sectioning plate to prevent injury.\nNote: To maintain sterility throughout the protocol, all tools should be sterilized via autoclaving and 70% ethanol spray and users should wear all relevant sterile PPE (sterile gown or lab coat, mask, and surgical gloves).\nAt least 30 min prior to tissue collection, chill a bottle of Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution and the Compresstome chilling block in a ‒20°C freezer.\nWeigh out 0.25 g low-melting agarose into a 50 mL flask.\nPrepare the sectioning blade as following:\nIf necessary, remove any residual glue residue from the Compresstome blade holder using acetone.\nCut a standard razor blade along the dotted lines marked in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], first horizontally to create a single-sided blade, then remove the top corners.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3117-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Sectioning blade preparation – Visual representation of step 3\nAdhere the prepared blade to the flat side of the Compresstome blade holder, flush against the lip of the blade holder, using a small amount of super glue.\nAllow at least 20 min to dry and set.\nSponge preparation\nTiming: 30 min\nThe culture platform for this protocol is stored long-term as dried, cross-linked sponges. Prior to sectioning and plating the explants, these sponges should be soaked in the species specific media to soften and take up the media components.",
    "Note: This step should be done in a sterile environment, either in a tissue culture hood or on benchtop with a Bunsen burner flame. Likewise, all instruments (forceps and scalpels) should be sterile, either autoclaved or washed with 70% Ethanol and sterilized with flame.\nUsing forceps and a scalpel, trim sponges to cubes approximately 1 cm thick (base sponge). Cut thin sponges 2–3 mm thick (top sponge).\nTransfer base sponges into 24 well plate(s) and group top sponges by treatment into 60 mm plates.\nSoak each base sponge with 750 μL of the species specific explant media per well and soak each set of top sponges in approximately 2 mL of the species specific explant media.\nNote: Any drugs or relevant treatment additives should be added to the species specific explant media prior to addition to the sponges.\nCritical: Pipet the species specific explant media on top of sponge, rather than directly into well to facilitate sponge soaking from both the top and bottom.\nPlace plates in 37°C incubator to soak until explant are ready to plate.\nNote: Sponges should be fully soaked within 30 minutes. If sponges are cut larger, more time and/or media might be necessary.\nTissue collection and preparation\nTiming: 10 min\nThis protocol accommodates culturing of both human and murine derived tissue. Steps 8‒12 are specific for collecting tissue samples from mice. If working with human patient samples, please proceed directly to Step 13. If possible, resected patient tissue should be in the shape of a cylinder or wedge, with 2–3 mm width and a longer axial dimension (> 1 cm if possible) in order to facilitate stable embedding into the sample holder and sufficient cross-sectional area for analysis.",
    "Critical: Speed is of the essence to maximize tissue viability. The entire process from collection to plating should take less than an hour.\nNote: Although it may not be possible to collect the tumor tissue under completely sterile conditions, all instruments (forceps and scalpels) should be sterile, either autoclaved or washed with 70% Ethanol and sterilized with flame.\nNote: Just prior to tissue collection, fill wells of a 6-well plate halfway with ice cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution. Keep plate on ice.\nHumanely euthanize the animal as per your approved IACUC protocol.\nPlace the mouse on a dissection stage on its back and spray the torso with 70% ethanol to sterilize the skin and fur.\nCut through the skin and expose the abdominal wall (peritoneum) through blunt dissection with scissors, then cut the peritoneum to open the abdominal cavity and locate the tumor.\nUse sterile dissection scissors and/or scalpel to remove the tumor from the surrounding tissue. Place in a sterile petri dish.\nIf necessary, remove any healthy pancreas tissue from the tumor, then transfer to the 6-well plate with ice-cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution and store on ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3117-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Specimen tube preparation and use – Visual representation of steps 13-14\n(A) The two components of the specimen tube, including the plunger (white) and the casing (grey metal).\n(B) The plunger is inserted partially into the casing, leaving a 2–3 cm well. Plunger and casing are then taped together (here with orange tape) to secure.\n(C) The completed specimen tube should be inserted vertically into ice for tumor embedding into agarose.\n(D) The agarose and tumor tissue are rapidly cooled by placing the cooling block over the specimen holder.",
    "(E) Once the agarose is fully solidified, the specimen holder is inserted into the collection tray, then the tape can be removed (not shown).\nEmbed tissue in specimen tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCreate a 2.5% w/v solution of sterile distilled water and low-melting agarose (10 mL H2O and 0.25 g agarose) and microwave until the agarose is fully dissolved (approximately 30 s).\nCritical: Let cool approximately 1 minute until the flask is comfortable to touch (around 50°C/120°F).\nInsert Compresstome white plastic plunger into metal casing, leaving an approximately 2–3 cm chamber.\nTape casing to plunger with lab tape and place the completed construct vertically in ice, as illustrated in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B.\nUse a transfer pipet to fill the specimen tube with agarose solution.\nUsing forceps, fully submerge the tumor tissue into the liquid agarose solution.\nInsert the cold chilling block over the specimen tube and allow to incubate on ice for several minutes until the agarose solidifies.\nNote: The agarose will solidify and turn slightly opaque. Remove the sample from the cooling block before the agarose freezes, as indicated by crystals forming on the edges of the agarose.\nTissue sectioning\nTiming: 20 min\nBulk tissue is first embedded in an agarose matrix, then sectioned using the Compresstome into explant slices.\nRemove the specimen tube from chilling block and ice, then insert tube into Compresstome tray through the hole in the side wall until flush with raised rim on tube. Then remove tape to release the plunger.\nConnect the Compresstome tray to the base with the provided screw.\nAdd ice cold Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) to tray to fully submerge the specimen tube.\nAttach the blade holder to the vibration head with blade-side facing the control box and secure using the provided Allen wrench.\nPress “Start” to begin sectioning.",
    "Note: Speed and oscillation settings will depend on the characteristics of the bulk tissue. The settings listed above are appropriate for autochthonous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) but may need to be adjusted slightly for other tissue types, such as orthotopic or subcutaneous.\nCollect slices into cold HBSS in a 6-well plate on ice.\nOnce the necessary number of explant slices have been obtained for the experiment, remove the remaining bulk tissue from the specimen holder with forceps and preserve as desired as the “day 0” sample.\nFormalin Fixed – transfer into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube with 1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubate at 4°C for 2 h, then transfer to 70% ethanol at room temperature (20°C–22°C) until paraffin embedding.\nFrozen – fill sample mold halfway with Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound (OCT), transfer explant tissue and flatten as much as possible, fully cover with additional OCT, store at ‒80°C.\nTissue transfer to sponge plate\nTiming: 10 min/plate\nThe following steps describe an efficient method of transferring thin, malleable tissue slices from buffer to the culture sponge platform.\nNote: This step should be done in a sterile environment, either in a tissue culture hood or on benchtop with a Bunsen burner flame. Likewise, all instruments (forceps and spatulas) should be sterile, either autoclaved or washed with 70% ethanol and sterilized with flame.\nRemove sponge plate from incubator to a sterile environment.\nUse forceps to slide explant flat onto a spatula.\nTransfer the explant slice to the sponge by touching the edge of the spatula to the sponge and using the forceps to slide the tissue onto the sponge, as demonstrated in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nNote: If necessary, use the forceps to flatten the tissue onto the sponge top surface as much as possible.",
