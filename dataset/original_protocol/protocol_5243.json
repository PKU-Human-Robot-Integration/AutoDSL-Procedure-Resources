    "Preparations of sgRNA expression vectorsTake 10 μg of ppU6-(BsaI)2-gRNA and let it be digested with 50 U of BsaI in 100 μl NEB3.1 buffer at 37 °C for 2 h.Purify the linearized vector DNA with a clean-up kit and elute it with 30 μl of 1/10x TE. Store the purified linearized vector at -20 °C before use.Dissolve the primers listed in Table 1 in TE and adjust the concentrations to 50 μM.Notes: Add each 10 μl of forward and reverse primers (Table 1, 50 μM, each) to a vial and mix them with 30 μl of TEN. Incubate the mixture at 90 °C for 10 min in a dry block heater.Transfer the mixture to a 65 °C dry block and incubate for 30 min. Then let the block gradually cool down to room temperature for about 30 min. Put the annealed primer pair on ice until the following ligation reaction.Table 1. Primers for ppU6-sgRNA expression vector constructionimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531215611_9826.jpgThe first nucleotide of the last exon of pig GGTA1 gene was numbered as +1, and the last nucleotide of the last intron was numbered as -1 (Su et al., 2015).For the ligation reaction, mix 1 μl of BsaI digested vector, 3 μl of annealed primer pair, 5 μl of 2x ligation buffer and 1 μl T4 DNA ligase in a vial on ice. Then incubate the vial at 16 °C for 90 min to perform the ligation reaction.After the transformation, isolate plasmid samples from the individual colonies. Use M13 reverse primer for DNA sequencing (Note 1).Purify the DNA for pronuclear microinjection by two rounds of CsCl density-gradient ultra-centrifugation. The NVTi65 rotor is used in general and the centrifugation conditions are set at 218,000 x g for 20 h at 20 °C.Animals and animal careRaise all animals in a specific pathogen free farm.",
    "Feed the animals on a restricted diet (4% body weight) with free access to water.Raise the recipients normally but treat them with special care particularly during farrowing.All animals should be managed and treated in accordance to your federal and institutional guidelines.Synchronization and superovulationSynchronize the donors and recipients by feeding with a commercial ration supplemented with Regumate® (containing 0.4% Altrenogest; Intervet, MSD, France) for 15 days to synchronize their estrus cycles. Feed the recipients with Regumate® for one more day.On the last day of feeding Regumate®, inject PGF2 (250 μg Cloprostenol) intramuscularly (i.m.) to lyse any remaining corpus luteum. For superovulation induction, inject all pigs intramuscularly with PMSG and hCG to induce follicle growth/oocyte maturation and ovulation, respectively. Briefly, on the next day of the last feeding with Regumate®, inject all of the donors with 2,000 i.u. of PMSG. Then inject them with 1,500 i.u. of hCG 78 h later. Inject the recipients by the same regimen with 1,500 i.u. PMSG and 1,250 i.u. hCG to induce follicle growth/oocyte maturation and ovulation, respectively. For artificial insemination, artificially inseminate the donors with fresh diluted semen containing at least 3 billion viable sperms with 80% mobility as assessed by computer-assisted sperm analysis system at 24 h and 36 h after hCG injection. Induce the synchronized ovulation of recipients by the same methods with a 12 h delay and without insemination.Pronuclear oocytes recoveryDuring 54-56 h after hCG injection, sacrifice all of the donors to harvest the upper uterus horns and oviducts.For the collection of zygotes, insert and connect infundibulum with a glass tube to guide the D-PBS into a 50 ml Falcon tube. Flush out the fertilized eggs from the oviducts by injection of 20 ml D-PBS with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) into the fallopian tube near the uterotubal junction.",
    "(Figure 2)Keep the embryos in DPBS in a thermal box at 37 °C and carry them to a laboratory for further micromanipulation within 30 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531215904_1032.jpgFigure 2. Flushing newly fertilized eggs from porcine fallopian tube. The maturation and ovulation are indicated by the follicle with an ovulation point (arrow head 1). A stainless needle (#19) with a blunt end is used to penetrate the uterus wall, and it is inserted through the uterotubal junction (arrow head 2) into the fallopian tube (arrow head 3). A glass tube (arrow hear 5, outside diameter 4 mm) is connected into the other end of the fallopian tube through the open of infundibulum (arrow head 4). The fertilized eggs within the fallopian tube are flushed out by 20 ml D-PBS with a syringe (arrow head 6) and collected in a 50 ml Falcon tube (arrow head 7).MicroinjectionCentrifuge the recovered fertilized eggs at 15,000 x g for 10 to 15 min at 25 °C to expose their pronuclei (Figure 3).Notes: Then put the embryos into a 20 µl D-PBS micro-drop on an inverted microscope equipped the differential interference contrast system.Perform the pronuclear microinjection under 300-fold magnification.Hold the embryos in a proper position to reveal a clear view of pronuclei.Then microinject the CRISPR/Cas9 DNA mixture into one pronucleus through a capillary needle. The diameter of tip opening for an injection pipette is about 0.5 µm. After applying injection pressure, the continuous flow stream of DNA is shown by moving the zygote away from the tip of the microinjection capillary. Before injection into pronuclei, the pipette tip was placed in the perivitelline space (PVS). A suitable injection flow speed is adjusted by increasing or decreasing the injection pressure according to the swelling velocity of PVS.",
    "The concentrations of plasmid DNA were 6 ng/µl for pCX-Flag2-NLS1-Cas9-NLS2 and 2 ng/µl for each of the four ppU6-sgRNA vectors (Note 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531220113_9135.jpgFigure 3. Pronuclear microinjection of a pig embryo. Centrifugation is critical to reveal the pronuclei, indicated by arrowheads, from the optically dense contents in the pig embryo. Scale bar = 20 μm.Embryo transferAfter microinjection of CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid vectors into the pronuclei, transfer 20 to 30 embryos into the oviduct through a transfer pipette by the surgical method:Before operation, perform a 24 h fasting with free access to water for all of the recipients.Twenty minutes before surgery, inject 5 mg atropine sulfate and 400 mg Stresnil to decease saliva discharge and sedate the animals, respectively.Set up an ear vein catheter and fix it by 3M paper tape for i.v. injection of Citosol to maintain anesthesia, with the duration of operations lasting for 40 to 50 min.Load and fasten the recipients upside down on the operation table. Clean their abdomen skin and shave and sterilize the hair. Then cover the animal with a sterilized drape.Create an 8-10 cm window on the linea alba among the last 2nd to 3rd nipple, pull a single side of uterus horns, fallopian tubes and ovary outside the abdomen, and then count the number of corpus luteum on the ovary. Put back the largest part of the uterus horn immediately into cavum abdominis. Keep the remaining upper uterus horn, fallopian tube, infundibulum and ovary outside for embryo transfer (Figure 4A).Load 10-15 embryos in D-PBS in a glass transferring tube controlled by mouth pipet and transfer the embryos into the oviduct isthmus (Figure 4B).Rinse the uterus horn by saline containing heparin sulfate (50,000 U/L), and then put it back into the cavum abdominis.Before suturing the cut window, infuse 10 ml of amoxicillin into the cavum abdominis.",
    "After embryos transference, close the peritoneum parietale and muscle of the abdominal wall by continuous suture, and suture the adipose layer and skin by interrupted vertical mattress.Finally, inject 10 ml of amoxicillin i.m. at the neck during the following three days to prevent infection.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170531/20170531220351_4968.jpgFigure 4. Embryo transfer. A. Upper uterus horns, uterus, fallopian tubes, infundibula and ovaries are kept outside for embryo transfer. B. The embryos are loaded in a glass tube controlled by mouth pipet, and transferred into the oviductal isthmus (abbreviations: u for the uterus, uh for the uterus horn, ft for the fallopian tube, and inf for the infundibulum).Farrowing and piglets careMove the sows to the farrowing pens seven days before the expected delivery day.Observe the nervous and restless behaviors of the sows; check the lactation further by hand milking.On the day when sows start to lactate, check the sows intensively to ascertain any one of them need assistance for delivering, and take care of the neonates.On the next day when farrowing was completed, collect the piglets’ tail tissue samples for DNA extraction and further genomic analysis."
