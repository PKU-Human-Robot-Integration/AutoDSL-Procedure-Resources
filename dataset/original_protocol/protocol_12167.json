  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were carried out according to the provisions of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council code of practice for the care and use of animals and were approved by the institutional ethics committees.\n1. Preparation of Zebrafish\nAdult fish pairing\n\t\nSet up adult fish as pairs (or two pairs) in appropriately sized breeding tanks the evening prior to use.\nTo keep the female separated from the male, use a divider to enable the fish to see, but not touch each other.\nIn the morning, after switching on the light, remove the dividers and allow the fish to mate undisturbed.\nAfter successful mating put adult fish back into their original tanks.\n\t\tNOTE: Host and donor strains may be the same, e.g., any wild type (WT) strains. For this study the donor embryos derived from the transgenic lines Tg(atoh7:gapRFP), Tg(atoh7:gapGFP) or Tg(vsx1:GFP) in which the expression of fate determinant factors driving early or late neural fate can be visualized, respectively 14,15,16. In order to compare the effects of differing genetic environments, host embryos can be specific mutants or morphants as described below.\nEmbryo collection\n\t\nUse a tea strainer to collect the eggs from the breeding box. Check for eggs every 15 min to determine the time of birth and ensure single-cell stage embryos are collected for subsequent steps.\nRinse embryos with E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM KCl, 0.4 mM CaCl2, 0.9 mM MgCl2 and 2% methylene blue in distilled water) and place them in Petri dishes containing ~ 40 mL E3 17 at a maximum density of 50 eggs per 90 mm diameter Petri dish.\nLabel the Petri dishes with the strain name, date and time of birth. Use a Pasteur transfer pipette to remove any debris whilst viewing the embryos under the dissecting microscope.",
    "Keep the embryos at 28.5 °C until ~3 h postfertilization (hpf) for transplantation, or continue with microinjections.\n\t\tNOTE: For transplantations, aim for donor and host embryos at similar ages. Therefore, utilize different rearing temperatures between 25 - 32 °C according to Kimmel et al. 18 to slow down or speed up one clutch of embryos to match the other.\nKeep ~20 of the transgenic donor embryos uninjected at 32 °C from the time of collection until time-lapse imaging (24 - 28 h later).\n\t\tNOTE: These will develop faster than the experimental cohort and will express fluorescent markers earlier. They can thus be used to set up the parameters (laser power, gain) for the imaging. In this particular example, imaging of the experimental cohort begins prior to transgene expression (to assess the exact timing of this event).\n2. Preparation for Microinjection\nMicroinjection needle preparation\n\t\nUse a needle puller to pull needles from each borosilicate glass capillary tube (1.0 mm O.D. / 0.78 mm I.D / 100 mm long glass capillary) in the center to obtain two needles of equal length. Aim for needles that taper with long shafts.\n\t\tNOTE: Example settings for the needle puller used here are supplied in the\n\t\t\n\t\tMaterials List.\nStore the pulled needles in a Petri dish and secure by pressing them into a strip of moldable putty or adhesive tape.\nPrior to the injection bring the tip of the needle in focus under a dissecting microscope and use forceps to break open the needle at the tip. Aim for a sharp tapered tip with a small opening (Figure 1C).\nMorpholino preparation for host embryos\n\t\nOrder morpholino oligonucleotides specifically designed for the gene of interest as well as a standard control morpholino or an appropriate 5 base-pair mismatch to control for procedural and handling effects.",
    "NOTE: Here, a translation blocking Ptf1a morpholino with the sequence 5'-TTGCCCAGTAACAACAATCGCCTAC-3' that inhibits the development of the intermediate born horizontal and amacrine cells, and a standard control zebrafish morpholino targeting human beta-globin intron mutation (5'-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3') 7,19 were used.\nPrepare a 1 mM morpholino stock solution (~8 - 8.5 ng/nL) and store at room temperature.\nOn the day of injection, heat an aliquot (10 µL) of morpholino at 65 °C for 10 min, spin briefly and place on ice to cool down from 65 °C (after which it can be kept at room temperature during use). This will reverse any potentially aggregation within the morpholino solution, which can decrease effectiveness of the knockdown.\n\t\t\nFor Ptf1a morpholino and equivalent standard control morpholino, prepare a working solution of 6 ng/nL by diluting the morpholino stock solution with distilled water. Keep at RT.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Use 2 nL of the morpholino per embryo as the Ptf1a morpholino requires a relatively high working concentration of 12 ng per embryo as determined previously 7. For most morpholinos, 2 - 5 ng per embryo is effective, so dilute the stock to 2 - 5 ng/nL and inject 1 nL into each embryo.\nPreparing fluorescent histone fusion reporter constructs for labeling donor embryos\n\tNOTE: In order to distinguish / visualize donor cells within the host embryos, there are different approaches to label the donor embryo, including microinjection of H2A-GFP (if using transgenic donors with red fluorescent reporters) or H2B-RFP (if using transgenic donors with green fluorescent reporters) mRNA into the yolk of the single-cell stage donor embryo.\n\t\nLinearize at least 1 µg plasmid containing the reporter DNA.",
    "NOTE: Here pCS2+ plasmid (generated and kindly provided by Prof. David Turner from the University of Michigan and Prof. Ralph Rupp from the Biomedical Center Munich) containing H2A-GFP or H2B-RFP (generated by Dr. Christopher Wilkinson, Royal Holloway, University of London) was linearized with NotI restriction enzyme digestion.\nPurify DNA using commercially available kits as per manufacturer's instructions.\nTranscribe mRNA using commercially available kits with appropriate polymerase as per manufacturer's instructions. For the pCS2+ plasmid, use a SP6 polymerase kit.\nPurify mRNA using commercial kits or phenol-chloroform extraction followed by isopropanol precipitation as per manufacturer's instructions. Dilute the mRNA in ultrapure water (20 - 30 µL), measure the concentration with a spectrophotometer and store at -80 °C.\nOn the day of injection, prepare a working solution of mRNA in sterile water with a final concentration of 100 ng/µL and keep on ice. Return unused mRNA stock back to -80 °C.\n3. Microinjection of Morpholinos and/or mRNA into Single-cell Stage Embryos\nNOTE: Microinjections are used to mark all donor cells and to prepare the different host environments (control and gene knockdown) and involve injections of mRNA or morpholino antisense oligonucleotides 20,21.\nLoading and calibrating the injection needle\n\t\nBackload the injection needle with 3 μL of the morpholino and/or histone-fluorescent fusion mRNA solution using microloader pipette tips.\nShake the solution towards the injection needle tip until there are no bubbles remaining. Use injection needles with an internal glass insert such that the solution will be primarily drawn to the tip by capillary action.\nAttach the injection needle to a holder mounted in a micromanipulator (3D manual micromanipulator) and ensure a tight seal within the tube housing.\nTurn on the power and gas supply to the pressure regulated microinjector.",
    "Immerse the needle tip in a drop of mineral oil in a dish (if using a graticule eyepiece) or hover the needle tip directly over a micrometer slide to calibrate the drop volume. Measure the injection volume by pressing the foot pedal and adjust the gas pressure and/or duration time until the injection volume is equivalent to 1 nL (125 μm diameter).\n\t\tNOTE: The advantage of the micrometer slide is that measurements are independent from the magnification used at the microscope, however by using the eyepiece graticule instead, the injection drop and scale can be in focus simultaneously.\nEmbryo microinjection\n\t\nPlace a microscope slide in a Petri dish and use a transfer pipette to deposit single-cell stage embryos along the slide edge. Align into a single column using a microloader pipette tip with half of the thin tip cut off. Remove as much liquid as possible with a fine transfer pipette to prevent movements during injections (Figure 1A).\nLower the needle towards each embryo, and penetrate the chorion and yolk in one smooth stroke (Figure 1B).\nOnce the needle tip is centered in the yolk, microinject by pressing the foot pedal. Inject 1 nL of H2A-GFP or H2B-RFP mRNA into the yolk of a single-cell stage donor embryo (transgenic). Inject 2 nL of standard MO or Ptf1a MO into the yolk of a single-cell stage wild type host embryo by pressing the foot pedal twice. Successful injections can be visualized by the small spatial deformation in the yolk.\nRemove the injection needle, move the dish containing the embryos to bring the next embryo into position and continue injecting until the entire column of embryos are injected (50 - 60 embryos).",
    "After injecting all embryos, lift the dish up at a 30 - 45° angle and use a gentle stream of E3 medium (squeeze bottle) to transfer the injected embryos into a new clean Petri dish.\nPlace the embryo dish in an incubator (either at 28.5 °C or other temperature to ensure that the donor and host embryos are at equivalent ages).\nRepeat steps 3.2.1 - 3.2.6 as necessary to obtain ~100 donor embryos or ~200 - 250 host embryos.\nAt 1 - 2 hpf, check the embryos under a dissecting microscope and remove any unfertilized eggs that have not advanced to the 2- or 4-cell stages with a Pasteur transfer pipette.\n4. Preparation for Transplantations\nNOTE: Transplantations are used to generate chimeric embryos allowing for the effects of different genetic host environments to be assessed within equivalent WT donor progenitors 9,22,23.\nDonor embryo selection\n\t\nAt 3 hpf, check the donor embryos at 2 - 5X magnification for labeling signal under a fluorescence microscope. Select well-developed (symmetric cell mass with evenly sized cells) embryos with a strong fluorescent signal using the GFP plus filter (460-500 nm excitation, 510 nm long pass emission) or Texas Red filter (540 - 580 nm excitation, 610 nm long pass emission) (Figure 1D). The transgenic reporters are not yet expressed.\nAgarose injection plate and Petri dish preparation\n\t\nPour molten 2% agarose diluted in E3 medium into a 90 mm diameter Petri dish and let it cool down until the dish is safe to touch. Hot agarose can otherwise deform the mold.",
    "Float a plastic mold with wedge-shaped protrusions (6 x 25/mold) on the agarose (Figure 2D, E). Avoid air bubbles by placing one side of the mold onto the agarose and slowly lower down the other side. Make sure the mold is centered in the dish or towards the side of the deepest point of the wedge-shaped protrusions to allow enough clearance space for the transplantation needle.\nAllow the agarose to completely solidify at RT.\nPlace the agarose dish at 4 °C for 30 min and remove the molds by gently lifting from one corner (e.g., with forceps). Prepare agarose injection plates the day prior to the experiment and store at 4 °C with a small volume of E3 medium and paraffin film seal to prevent them from drying out.\nPrior to the transplantation, fill the agarose injection plate with E3 medium and place into a 28.5 °C incubator for at least 30 min.\nSince dechorionated embryos stick to plastic, either use glass dishes or coat the inside of Petri dishes (90 mm diameter) with a thin layer of 2% agarose in E3. Prepare one dish for dechorionated host embryos, one dish for dechorionated donor embryos and one dish for every 40 transplanted embryos. Store as described for the injection plate (4.2.4).\nTransfer pipette preparation\n\t\nCut the tip of a long form finely pulled glass tip Pasteur pipette (2 mL volume, 230 mm length, 100 mm long tip) to a length that allows for comfortable maneuvering (optional) by scratching with a diamond knife whilst rotating until the tip falls off (Figure 1F).\nEnsure that the cut is straight. Fire polish the glass transfer pipette by rotating the cut surface in a Bunsen burner to generate smooth ends so as to not damage the dechorionated embryos (Figure 1F).",
    "NOTE: Keeping the pipette tip in the flame for too long will result in the opening being sealed up or becoming too small for the embryos.\nDechorionating blastula stage donor and host embryos\n\t\nDechorionate embryos either manually with two fine forceps by tearing open each chorion without touching the embryo, or enzymatically using protease to allow simultaneous rapid dechorionation of a large number of embryos 9.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 100x stock solution of 50 mg/mL protease mixture, make 100 μL aliquots and store them at -20 °C.\nAdd 100 μL of the stock protease to 10 mL E3 medium (final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL protease).\nPlace well developed host and donor embryos in two separate small Erlenmeyer glass beakers (10 mL) and remove as much liquid as possible.\nAdd 5 mL of the 0.5 mg/mL protease solution to each beaker and gently swirl the embryos whilst looking at them under a dissecting microscope. Watch for any signs of deformation of the chorion.\nKeep swirling. As soon as the first embryo is out of the chorion (Figure 1D, asterisks), perform three quick rinses with E3 medium to remove the protease solution by pouring out most of the liquid and refilling the flask by gently pouring in E3 along the side. Do not allow dechorionated embryos to come in contact with the air in any of the subsequent steps until the end of transplantation (section 5), as they will burst. Leave adequate solution in the flask between rinses.\nWith the fire polished glass transfer pipette, transfer the embryos from the Erlenmeyer beaker into glass Petri dishes or agarose (2% in E3 medium) coated plastic dishes. Gently pipette during transfer to remove any remaining weakened chorion.\nTransplantation needle preparation",
    "Use a needle puller to pull two needles from each borosilicate thin wall glass tube (1.0 mm O.D. / 0.78 mm I.D / 100 mm length) with the same settings as the microinjection pipettes.\n\t\tNOTE: Example settings for the needle puller used here are supplied in the Materials List. Transplantations needles do not have a glass insert, as this damages the cells sucked into the needle.\nPull needles in advance, store in a Petri dish and secure by pressing into a strip of moldable putty or adhesive tape.\nPrior to transplantation bring the tip of the needle in focus under a dissecting microscope and use forceps to break open the needle at the tip. Use fine forceps to adjust the shape of the needle to aim for a flute-shape (Figure 2G), or use alternate methods described to generate the tip shape 23.\n5. Chimera Generation via Blastula Transplantation\nTransplantation setup\n\tNOTE: Here, a self-assembled transplantation apparatus was used (Figure 2A).\n\t\nMount the transplantation needle in the same needle holder used for microinjection above (mounted on micromanipulator, step 3.1.3) (Figure 2A).\nDisconnect the injecting tubing that links the end of the micropipette holder to the pressure regulated microinjector used for microinjections. Attach the injection tubing that is linked to a 1 mL syringe (Figure 2A, B), which represents the transplantation rig.\n\t\t\nEnsure that all connections are tightly sealed using paraffin film or moldable putty. Prevent embryos from coming in contact with air by ensuring that there is always some E3 medium in the transplantation needle itself. Operate the syringe manually to suck cells / liquid into and out of the transplantation needle.\nEmbryo alignment",
    "Transfer the donor embryos with the glass pipette into the first column of the agarose mold. Transfer the host embryos into columns 2 to 6 of the agarose mold (Figure 2F). Position the embryos with the pipette so that the blastomere side faces up.\nTransplantation\n\t\nGently rest the transplantation needle onto a blastomere cell of a donor embryo and slowly suck up about 20 - 50 cells into the transplantation needle (Figure 2H). Avoid sucking up the yolk.\nLift the transplantation needle from the donor embryo using the micromanipulator. Move the agarose mold dish to the left and insert the transplantation needle tip through the side of the cell mass into the animal pole of the first host embryo. Deposit 5 - 10 cells near the surface according to fate mapping showing that this area gives rise to the forebrain / eye field 24 (Figure 2I). Keep the needle tip immersed in the E3 medium throughout the whole procedure.\nCare of transplanted embryos\n\t\nRemove the donor embryos and leave the host embryos in the agarose mold for 1 - 2 h at 28.5 °C. Fill glass or plastic (coated with 2% agarose) Petri dishes with E3 medium containing 0.003% N-phenylthiourea (PTU) to prevent pigment formation as this will interfere with imaging. Transfer the host embryos into these dishes with the fire polished glass pipette and incubate at 28.5 °C O/N.\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear gloves when handling PTU.\n6. Live Imaging Setup",
    "NOTE: The small size and optical transparency of zebrafish combined with rapid development have allowed it to become a key vertebrate model for in vivo imaging of different cells and organs. Imaging can be performed on a variety of microscopes, which will differ in setup and parameters. The following describes a suitable confocal imaging setup for imaging of retinal development 5,8.\nChimeric embryo selection\n\t\nAt 24 - 26 hpf, screen the transplanted embryos under a fluorescent dissecting scope to select healthy well developed embryos that show the transplanted donor cells (H2A-GFP or H2B-RFP labeled) in the developing eye primordium.\nSet aside up to 40 embryos for mounting by pipetting into a new dish and add 0.4 mg/mL tricaine methanesulfate (MS222) to anesthetize the embryos.\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear gloves when handling MS222.\nMounting embryos\n\tNOTE: Use the appropriate mounting dish, depending on whether imaging will be performed on an inverted 8 or upright microscope (described here).\n\t\nPrepare a few 1.5 mL plastic tubes containing 1 mL of 1% low melt agarose in 0.4 mg/mL MS222 in E3 medium and keep molten in a 40 °C water bath.\nSuck up 5 embryos into a plastic transfer pipette and let the embryos accumulate in the tip by gravity. Touch the transfer pipette onto the surface of one of the prepared plastic tubes containing 1% low-melt agarose and 0.4 mg/mL MS222 allowing the embryos to sink into the tube whilst limiting the amount of E3 transfer.\nMount embryos in a 90 mm diameter Petri dish for imaging in upright microscope and glass bottom Petri dish (any size) for imaging in inverted microscope. Use a permanent marker to visually divide either dish into two halves to image donors in the WT hosts (on one side) or morphant hosts (other side) in the same experiment.",
    "Transfer the five embryos from the agarose plastic tube to either Petri dish with 0.5 - 1 mL agarose. Remove excess agarose with a transfer pipette so that only a small drop (~200 - 300 μL) remains. If imaging with upright microscopy, avoid placing embryos within 1 cm of the Petri dish circumference. The water immersion dipping lens used for imaging may not be able to be centered in that area due to the Petri dish wall (Figure 3A).\nUse a microloading pipette (with the tip broken off) to align the embryos laterally until the agarose solidifies. For both types of dishes, the embryos are correctly angled laterally if the two eyes at either side of the head are completely overlapping (aligned in X-Y dimension) (Figure 3B). For inverted microscopy use, the eye near the coverslip must be pushed as close to the coverslip as possible, to enable imaging through the z-dimension within the constraints of the possible focus levels.\nContinue mounting five embryos at a time in individual agarose drops. Use more 1% low melt agarose to join the agarose drops to each other and the side of the dish to prevent any dislodging and lateral movement during imaging (Figure 3A).\nOnce fully solidified, cover the dish with E3 medium (containing 0.003% PTU, 0.4 mg/mL MS222) prewarmed to 28.5 °C.\nUsing the same approach described in steps 6.2.2 - 6.2.8, mount ~20 transgenic embryos raised at 32 °C (step 1.2.5) in a separate dish.\nImaging parameters\n\tNOTE: Imaging to analyze the onset of fluorescent transgenes does not require high spatial intracellular resolution. It can be performed with a W Plan-Apochromat 20X / 1.0 DIC M27 70-mm objective at 1.5 zoom.",
    "Set up the laser power and exposure time based on the transgene intensity for the ~20 transgenic embryos with accelerated development (i.e. raised at 32 °C; step 6.2.8).\n\t\tNOTE: For studies of onset of transgene expression, the experimental embryos show no fluorescence at the time the time-lapse is set up and thus, these accelerated embryos are crucial for determining the parameters of the imaging.\nFor the experimental dish, visualize each embryo and save the position and focus levels of the embryos.\n\t\t\nChoose embryos that have the correct mounting angle (i.e. with the lateral side of the eye as horizontal as possible) and a strong heartbeat (an indicator of health). Choose embryos with a few transplanted donor cells (identified by H2A-GFP or H2B-RFP labeling) primarily in the anterior ventral quadrant of the developing retina (where the wave of gene expression begins) (Figure 3C).\n\t\t\tNOTE: In zebrafish embryos, the average heartrate is 120 - 180 beats/minute 25. In the anesthetized embryos, a healthy heartbeat may be in the range of 60 - 120 beats/minute. Slower heartbeat may be indicative of reduced viability and those embryos should be excluded from the study.\nSet z-stacks of optical sections at 2 μm intervals through the retina of up to 15 embryos.",
    "NOTE: The total number of embryos that can be imaged in any given experiment will depend on individual parameters (exposure time and z-stack size). The time taken to image 1 time-point for all of the chosen embryos must be shorter than the interval between time points. By sacrificing some depth resolution, more embryos can be imaged within the time intervals. The limits of the z-stack are chosen as lateral and medial extremes of the mounted embryos eye and 30 μm is added to the lateral side in the upright microscopy setup, as the eyes of the developing embryos in this setup shift in the z direction as the embryos grow overnight. This results in stacks 100 - 170 μm thickness (50 - 85 images/eye).\nTake images every 24 min at 32 °C (equivalent to 0.5 hpf intervals) using the laser/channel appropriate to the transgene.\n\t\tNOTE: The embryos remain on the stage throughout the entire time-lapse within a heated chamber encompassing the entire microscope. While the experiment can be conducted at 28 °C, warmer temperatures are used to speed up development and ensure that the relevant time-points in the experiment are imaged within the 16 - 24 h time-lapse period.\nImage channels representing the donor label (H2A-GFP or H2B-RFP - optional) and transgene (Atoh7:RFP or Vsx1:GFP) using sequential scanning. For analysis, utilize the donor label only to choose appropriate embryos as described (take one z-stack at the beginning of the imaging) and then perform time-lapse only on the channel to capture the transgene expression.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, use the donor label only to select appropriate embryos (i.e. those with confirmed transplanted cells in anterior ventral quadrant) and image only the transgene channel, roughly halving imaging time and almost doubling the number of embryos that can be imaged and analyzed per experiment (Figure 4).\nSubscription Required.
