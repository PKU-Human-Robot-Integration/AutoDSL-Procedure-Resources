    "All animal work described here was performed in accordance with legal regulations (EU-Directive 2010/63, license AZ 325.1.53/56.1-TUBS and license AZ 33.9-42502-04-14/1418).\n1. Preparation of Low Melting Agarose, Gel Plate, and Microinjection/Microgavage Needles\nDissolve 0.08 g of low melting agarose (Table of Materials, agarose A2576) in 10 mL of 30% Danieau's medium (0.12 mM MgSO4, 0.18 mM Ca [NO3]2), 0.21 mM KCl, 1.5 mM HEPES (pH = 7.2), and 17.4 mM NaCl, stored at room temperature (RT) to obtain a 0.8% solution.\n\tNOTE: Higher or lower concentrations of agarose can be used. However, the required time to solidify varies for different brands of agarose, even at the same concentration.\nPrepare microinjection and microgavage needles from glass capillaries (Table of Materials).\n\t\nUse a micropipette puller with the following settings (note that units are specific to the puller used here; see Table of Materials): microinjection needles (air pressure = 500; heat = 400; pull = 125; velocity = 75; time = 150); and microgavage needles (air pressure = 500; heat = 400; pull = 100; velocity = 75; time = 150). Use a microloader tip to load 3 µL of nuclease-free H2O into the pulled needle.\nIntroduce the needle into the injector and fasten it properly. Adjust the needle to a suitable angle for injection. Set the injection pressure between 600–900 hPa for microinjection needle and 200–300 hPa for gavage needle.\nPlace a drop of mineral oil onto the black circle of the calibration slide. Use fine forceps to clip the tip of the needle. Inject one drop into the mineral oil to measure the size of the droplet.",
    "For microinjection, adjust the injection time to obtain a droplet with a diameter of 0.10–0.12 mm, which equals a volume of 0.5–1.0 nL. For microgavage, obtain a droplet with a diameter of 0.18–0.20 mm, which equals a volume of 3–5 nL.\nPrepare a 1.5 % agarose plate with agarose (Table of Materials, 8050) in a 10 cm Petri dish in 30% Danieau's medium using a plastic mold as the microgavage mold. Store at 4 °C to prevent desiccation until needed. Warm to RT or 28 °C prior to the experiment.\n2. Preparation and Labeling of C. difficile and Spores with Fluorescent Dye\nPrepare a 1 mM stock solution of a fluorescent dye (Table of Materials). Because the dye is sold in 50 µg aliquots of powder, add 69 µL of DMSO to the vial to obtain a 1 mM stock concentration.\nPrepare a 100 µM working solution of the fluorescent dye by adding 2 µL of 1 mM stock solution to 18 µL of DMSO in a centrifuge tube, and mix well.\nCulture C. difficile (R20291, a ribotype 027 strain) by inoculating 10 mL of BHIS liquid medium with two to three colonies from a plate in an anaerobic hood without shaking overnight. BHIS is BHI supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract and 0.1% (w/v) L-cysteine. Dissolve 1 g of L-cysteine in 10 mL of ddH2O and sterilize by filtration, then add to the autoclaved medium to obtain a final concentration of 1 g/L. Plates are prepared by adding 15 g/L agar-agar to the medium before autoclaving. Selective culturing of C. difficile is done by using chromID C. difficile plates (Table of Materials).\nStaining C. difficile with the fluorescent dye",
    "Harvest C. difficile at an OD600 of 1.0–1.2 and wash 1x with 1 mL of 1x PBS (5,000 x g for 3 min at RT). Resuspend in 1 mL of 1 x PBS.\nAdd 3 µL of working solution of the fluorescent dye into 1 mL of bacteria suspension. Incubate the sample for 15 min at RT in the dark. Wash the stained C. difficile once with 1 mL PBS to remove residual dye and resuspend in 1x PBS to an OD600 of 1.0 (1.0 OD600 is approximately equivalent to 108 cfu/mL).\n3. Injection of Stained C. difficile into Zebrafish Larvae\nAnesthetize 20–30 zebrafish larvae at 5 days post-fertilization (referred to here as 5 dpf) with 0.02%–0.04% tricaine (tricaine powder is dissolved in double-distilled water and adjusted to pH = 7 with 1 M Tris-HCL solution) in 30% Danieau's's medium ~10 min before injection. Transfer the anesthetized larvae to a fresh 10 cm Petri dish and remove any excess 30% Danieau's's medium.\nPlace a drop of 0.8% low melting agarose onto the zebrafish larvae to cover. Gently adjust the larvae to a lateral position. Place the Petri dish on ice for 30–60 s to allow the low melting agarose to solidify. Add 30% Danieau's medium containing 0.02%–0.04% tricaine to cover the agarose.\nPrepare the injection solution. Add 1 µL of 0.5% phenol red in PBS solution into 9 µL of the dye-stained C. difficile inoculum to visualize the injection process.\nLoad a calibrated microinjection needle with the injection solution using a microloader. Mount the loaded needle onto a micromanipulator and position it under a stereomicroscope.\nAdjust the injection pressure between 600–900 hPa. Set the injection time to 0.1–0.3 s to obtain 0.5–1.0 nL. Set the needle in the micromanipulator at a ~45° angle pointing toward the embedded larvae.",
    "Place the needle tip above the gastrointestinal tract close to the urogenital pore. Pierce through agarose then the muscle with the needle tip, then insert it into the intestinal lumen and inject 0.5–1.0 nL of C. difficile. Use a fluorescence microscope to monitor the injected larvae and pick up the properly injected larvae for confocal imaging.\n4. Generation of Gnotobiotic Zebrafish Larvae\nUse the well-established natural breeding method to generate gnotobiotic zebrafish embryos, including: in vitro fertilization, washing with antibiotic-containing medium (1 µg/mL amphotericin B, 10 µg/mL kanamycin, and 20 µg/mL ampicillin), washing with 0.1% wt/vol polyvinyl pyrrolidone-iodine (PVP-I) solution, and incubation of the embryos in a cell culture hood12.\nMaintain all gnotobiotic zebrafish larvae under gnotobiotic conditions until 5 dpf or just before the gavage. After the gavage, zebrafish larvae will be transferred into a standard incubator but with sterile 30% Danieau's medium.\n5. Gavage of Zebrafish Larvae\nCalibrate the microgavage needle as described in step 1.2.\nMeasure the diameter of the tip of the needle by placing the needle on a calibration slide with one drop of mineral oil. Ensure that the tip is 30–40 µm in diameter, blunt, and smooth. Discard the sharp or rough needles.\n\tNOTE: Sharp edges of needles can be blunted by quick flaming.\nPrepare the gavage solution as described in step 3.3.\nLoad and mount the needle onto a micromanipulator as described in step 3.4. Adjust the micromanipulator to position the needle at a 45° angle.\nAnesthetize the zebrafish larvae referred to in step 3.1. When the larvae stop moving, transfer them to the groove of a microgavage mold using a Pasteur pipette.",
    "Place a drop of 0.8% low melting agarose onto the zebrafish larvae to cover. Gently adjust the larvae with heads facing upright at 45° angles in the groove and tails against the wall of the groove. Ensure that the angles of the heads are approximately the same so that they are aligned with the angle of the gavage needles. Place the microgavage mold on ice for 30–60 s, allowing the low melting agarose to solidify in order to stabilize the positions of the larvae.\nAdjust the injection pressure between 200–300 hPa. Set the injection time to 0.1–0.3 s to obtain an injection volume of 3–5 nL of C. difficile.\nGently operate the needle through the agarose then into the mouth of zebrafish larvae, through the esophagus. Once the tip of the needle is inside the anterior intestinal bulb, press the injection pedal to release the bacteria. Fill the lumen of the intestine with the delivered volume. Do not let it overflow from the esophagus or cloaca. Gently withdraw the needle from the mouth of the zebrafish.\nFollowing gavage, rescue the infected zebrafish larvae from the agarose with a flexible microloader tip by first cutting the agarose away then by lifting the larvae. Transfer these larvae into sterile 30% Danieau's medium. Rinse the larvae in sterile medium twice. Transfer the larvae to a fresh 10 cm Petri dish. The larvae will be maintained for up to 11 dpf.\n6. Confocal Microscopy Analysis of Injected Zebrafish Larvae\nAnesthetize zebrafish larvae referred to step 3.1. Make a hole in the bottom of a 35 mm Petri dish with a glass slide attached to the hole, referred as the imaging chamber. Transfer embryos to the bottom of the imaging chamber with an adequate amount of 30% Danieau's medium.",
    "Add 200–300 μL of 1% low melting agarose to cover the anesthetized larvae. Since an inverted confocal microscope is used, place the infected region of the larvae against the glass slide as closely as possible.\nLet the agarose solidify on ice for 30–60 s. Submerge the agarose with 30% Danieau's containing 0.02%–0.04% tricaine.\nImage the larvae with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Table of Materials).\n7. Dissection of Larval Zebrafish Intestine to Recover Viable C. difficile\nIsolate gastrointestinal tracts from larvae to analyze bacterial load. Start by euthanizing zebrafish larvae with 0.4 % tricaine.\nRinse the zebrafish briefly with sterile 1x PBS and transfer them to a fresh agarose plate.\nDissection of zebrafish\n\t\nInsert a needle into the dorsal trunk of zebrafish larvae close to the head to immobilize the zebrafish. Remove the head behind the gills with a lancet.\nInsert the second needle into the middle of the dorsal trunk. Insert the third needle into the abdomen of the zebrafish and pull the intestine out of the body cavity.\n\t\tNOTE: Extreme care is needed to isolate the intact intestine. If it is difficult to do so, perform additional pulls to separate the rest of the intestine from the remaining internal organs.\nUse a microinjection needle to transfer 10–15 intestines into a 1.5 mL tube containing 200 µL sterile of 1x PBS.\nHomogenize the intestines with a pestle to disrupt the tissue and prepare homogenates. Ensure the pestle reaches the bottom of the tube to disrupt all intestines completely.\nIncubate the homogenates in C. difficile rearing medium containing D-cycloserine and cefoxitin, with or without taurocholate (TCA, a germinant of C. difficile spores) in an anaerobic chamber.\nIncubate the plate anaerobically for 48 h at 37 °C.\nUse bacterial culture for 16S rRNA-PCR.",
    "Resuspend a colony in 50 µL of H2O and boil it at 95 °C for 15 min. Pellet the lysed debris by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 2 min at RT) and use 2 µL of the supernatant as a template in 25 µL of PCR-reaction using C. difficile-specific primers (Cdiff16Sfw: 5' GTG AGC CAG TAC AGG 3'; Cdiff16Srev: 5' TTA AGG AGA TGT CAT TGG 3').\nWhen bacteria from liquid culture are used, harvest 1 mL of culture and wash once with 1 mL of PBS (14,000 rpm for 2 min at RT). Resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of H2Odd and treat as done above. To further characterize bacterial colonies, streak on a BHIS- or chromID-plate (Table of Materials).\n   Subscription Required.
