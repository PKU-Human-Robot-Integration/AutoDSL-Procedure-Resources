    "NOTE: This study protocol was developed in accordance with the ethical guidelines approved by the investigational review board at University of California Los Angles.\n1. Preparation of Auditory and Visual Stimuli\nUsing software in which visual images can be generated, create two gray scale sinusoid gratings, approximately 5.7 inches in diameter and of any frequency (e.g., 1.36 cycles/degree of visual angle). The images will have an on-screen duration of 100 msec.\n\t\nTilt one of the gratings about 10 visual degrees to the right off the median, and tilt the other grating the same amount to the left of the grating.\nEnsure that the degree of the tilt is sufficient to allow the participants to distinguish a left tilt from a right tilt without relying on guessing.\nUsing software in which auditory tones can be generated, create two pure tones of 100 msec duration.\n\t\nMake one of the tones of a higher pitch and the other of a lower pitch. For instance, one pitch can be 750 Hz and the other 900 Hz.\nAs for the visual stimuli, ensure that the tones are sufficiently distinct such that participants can distinguish between them without relying on guessing.\n2. Programming of Stimulus Presentation\nUsing presentation software, create the computer code that will control the presentation of the auditory and visual stimuli during the experiment.\n\t\nFirst select the number of stimuli to be presented. Present at least 150 of each of visual and auditory stimuli per experimental condition, to ensure that there are enough repetitions for a reliable neurophysiological response.\nPresent visual stimuli centrally on a gray background, with the participant sitting at a comfortable viewing distance. Present the auditory stimuli through speakers positioned on either side of the screen.",
    "Note: For visual stimuli we recommend a gray background, with RGB values at the mid-point (128,128,128) between pure white (255,255,255) and pure black (0,0,0), with the white and black used in generation of the sinusoid stimuli. This ensures that the mean brightness of the background and stimulus are comparable, and the contrast is constant between any point in the stimulus and the background.\nFor each of auditory and visual stimuli, independently select the timing for the stimuli.\n\t\tNote: This prevents participants from anticipating stimuli based on temporal relationships between the two streams.\nUse an inter-stimulus interval (ISIs) of approximately 1 sec between sequential presentations of stimuli from the same modality. Slower ISIs will make the task more demanding on vigilance, faster ISIs may make it impossible for participants to make their responses in time.\nVary the precise ISI randomly within a range, such as 0.7 to 2 sec, to make the stimuli unpredictable to participants, preventing neural responses associated with anticipation.\nBecause cross-modal interactions can arise from simultaneously or near-simultaneously presented stimuli 21,22, keep the ISI between stimuli from two different streams at no less than 300 msec.\nEnsure that the auditory and visual stimuli appear to occur interleaved to the participants, but never co-occurring.\nLast, divide the stimuli into segments of twenty-five. These segments will be preceded by one of the three randomly selected task instructions, described in the next section.\n3. Task Instruction\nOrient the participant to the task prior to collecting neurophysiological measures of brain activity.\n\t\nInstruct participants to attend and respond to the auditory tones and to ignore the visual stimuli when the instruction is “Listen”. Present this instruction both through audio and visual means.",
    "Assign two buttons for participants to make responses to each tone. For example, “press the left arrow if the tone is high, and right arrow if the tone is low” when the instruction is “Listen”.\nSimilarly, instruct participants to attend and respond to the visual gratings and to ignore the auditory stimuli when the instruction is “Look”.\nAssign two buttons for participants to make responses to the visual gratings. For example, “press the left arrow if the grating is tilted to the left, and right arrow if the grating is tilted to the left”.\n\t\t\nUse the same two buttons for visual stimuli as for auditory stimuli to enhance the interference between the modalities and therefore the need to employ attention control mechanisms.\nFinally, instruct participants to make no responses when the instruction is “Passive”, but ensure that participants keep their eyes open and focused on the screen.\nThroughout the task session, alternate the instructions for “Listen” and “Look” between segments to switch a previously attended modality to being irrelevant, thus making it a potent distractor.\nRemind the participants to keep their eyes fixated on the middle of the screen, or a small dot or crosshair presented at the location of the visual stimulus, and to keep their eyes open throughout the experiment.\nBuild in eight to ten second breaks between segments to mitigate effects of fatigue, allow the participants to rest their eyes, as well as longer 1-2 min breaks every 6-8 min.\nFinally, provide each participant with ample practice to ensure that they are performing the task correctly. It may be beneficial, especially for participants who have attention difficulties, to practice the visual and the auditory tasks with the attended stream presented in isolation, without the concurrent presentation of the distractor stream.\n4. Neurophysiological Data Collection",
    "Once the participants are familiar with the task, begin collection of neurophysiological responses to attended and ignored signals during the IMAT.\nPrepare the electroencephalography (EEG) cap and recording equipment according to manufacturer instructions, and in accordance with current methodology and publication standards for EEG research 26,27.\n\tNote: Important EEG recording parameters for EEG recording during the IMAT, that can be user specified, include: (a) sampling rate of 128-1,024 Hz, to capture the low-frequency of ERP signals; (b) alternating current (AC) recording to minimize slow drift; (c) net with sampling of entire scalp and with at minimum of 64 sensors, if source imaging analyses are to be performed.\nApply the cap to the participant’s scalp and verify signal impedance and quality at each of the sensors. Pay special attention to ensure that impedances of the recording electrodes are uniform and within the range recommended by manufacturer.\n\tNote: At this time, also add any additional physiological measurement devices if wanting to collect non-neural physiological signals such as respiration or pulse.\nSynchronize the neurophysiological recordings with the stimulus presentation software and neurophysiological recording software according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nRecord the neurophysiological signals while the participant performs the task, ensuring that the recording software has precise record of the timing of each stimulus and response for subsequent analysis.\n5. Offline Data Analysis\nPrepare the neurophysiological data for statistical analysis using analysis software.\nFirst, remove non-neural signal components that will contribute variability to the neurophysiological recordings of brain responses.\n\t\nUse a high-pass filter of 0.1-1 Hz, to remove slow drifts such as those caused by changes in impedance of the sensors.\nUse a low-pass filter of 30-50 Hz to remove high frequency components introduced by electrical noise.\nIdentify sensors that show unreliable data, and exclude these or interpolate the signals.",
    "Identify and eliminate large infrequent noise components such as muscle artefact from jaw contraction or movements of the forehead, and systematic, non-neural contributions, such as eye movements.\n\t\tNote: Typical algorithms to remove non-neural components include independent components analysis and regression, as well as iterative algorithms based on explicit selection criteria (e.g., voltage changes that exceed a threshold). Follow guidelines of available analysis software, and proceed in accordance with current standards for EEG research 26,27.\nOnce major non-neural components of the neurophysiological data have been removed, re-reference the data at each electrode by subtracting from each sensor the mean across all other sensors or the mean across left and right mastoid channels.\n\tNote: This step re-expresses the effects at each sensor relative to a neutral reference that is assumed to contain zero neural signals.\n\tNote: Sparser electrode montages may not have sufficient sampling to meet the assumptions of this technique 26,27. In the latter case, the mean of the left and right mastoid may provide a more accurate reference.\nNext extract temporal epochs of approximately 1 sec surrounding each auditory and each visual event shown. Include 100 msec preceding the stimulus onset to serve as a baseline interval and at least 600 msec following the stimulus onset.\nAverage the data from all epochs that fall into the same condition — attended, ignored, and passively perceived stimuli — to compute the average evoked response potential or “ERP”. Subtract the mean of the data in the pre-stimulus baseline to re-express the ERP amplitudes as changes relative to the pre-stimulus signal.\nTo identify the time course of attending processes, compare the amplitude and timing, as well as spatial distribution of the ERP response after attended stimuli, against those during the passive condition.",
