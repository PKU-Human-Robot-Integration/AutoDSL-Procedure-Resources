  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: This protocol uses C. elegans strains in which potential interacting partners are both tagged. It is strongly recommended that a negative control strain be used, in which one tagged protein is not expected to interact with another tagged candidate interaction partner. Here, GFP alone was used as a negative control to assess background, as DLC-1 is not expected to interact with GFP in the worm. GFP-tagged OMA-1 was used as the experimental strain, as preliminary data suggest an interaction with DLC-1. Nematode strains co-expressing control and test proteins with 3xFLAG-tagged DLC-1 are referred to in this text as 3xFLAG::DLC-1; GFP and 3xFLAG::DLC-1; OMA-1::GFP (strains available upon request; more information in Table of Materials), respectively. Here, the 3xFLAG and GFP tags are used; however, other tags may be substituted as long as their antibodies are compatible with the PLA kit reagents.\n1. Animal care\nKeep worms on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates that are seeded with the OP50 strain of E. coli and maintain at 24 °C for optimal expression of GFP.\nPassage adult worms every 2-3 days to propagate worms and keep them well-fed.\n2. Preparation of synchronous culture\nSynchronize worms by bleaching a plate of well-fed, gravid hermaphrodites. A bleaching protocol is described in Porta-de-la-Riva et al.29. Let the embryos hatch overnight in a centrifuge tube at 24 °C while rotating end over end in 10 mL of M9 minimal media (M9) buffer. This will produce a culture of arrested L1 larvae.\nIncubate the tube of arrested L1 stage larvae on ice for 10 min, then top off the tube with ice cold 1x M9.\nUse a centrifuge to pellet the larvae at 600 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Carefully aspirate the supernatant so that only 1-2 mL of supernatant remains.",
    "Re-suspend the pellet of larvae and use a micropipette to transfer 2 µL of suspended larvae culture to a glass slide. Count how many larvae are present to determine the density of the larvae culture, which will help guide seeding of the worms in step 2.5.\n\tNOTE: A density of 10-15 L1 larvae/1 µL works well for seeding.\nUse a micropipette to transfer the volume of larvae culture needed to seed approximately 100-120 L1 stage larvae on a 60 mm OP50 plate. For example, seed 10 µL of a larvae culture that has a density of 10 L1 larvae/1 µL of culture.\n\tNOTE: Do not exceed a volume of 40 µL to seed the larvae, or excess liquid will disrupt the OP50 lawn. If the culture volume exceeds 40 µL, repeat steps 2.3-2.4 to further reduce the volume and increase the density of larvae culture.\nGrow worms at 24 °C. Record the time when L1s are seeded on plate and periodically check the stage of development to identify the ideal time for dissection.\n\tNOTE: At 52 h after seeding of L1s, worms cultured at 24 °C are typically in the young adult stage, which is the ideal stage for dissection for gonad-targeted PLA. However, the actual time at which the synchronized worms reach young adult stage may vary among strains and incubation temperature.\n3. Dissection/gonad extrusion",
    "NOTE: Dissection to extrude the gonad is necessary for gonad-targeted PLA to work successfully. This approach can also release embryos, which also work using this protocol for PLA (see Discussion for more information). After dissection, both the negative control and experimental samples are fixed and treated for PLA together in parallel. It is also suggested that an additional set of samples be prepared for the purpose of fluorescent co-immunostaining23 to demonstrate expression patterns of the protein partners of interest.\nPick 30-40 young adult worms into a watch glass dish containing 500 µL of 1x M9 + levamisole (2.5 mM final concentration). After collecting the worms, carefully remove and discard most of the media to remove bacteria that is transferred along with the worms.\nAdd in fresh 500 µL of 1x M9 + levamisole and use the pipette to gently draw up and dispense the media to rinse the worms. Carefully remove and discard most of the media to clear bacteria that is transferred along with the worms.\n\t\nRepeat this step 2x-3x until all bacteria are removed. After washes are completed, leave worms in about 100 µL of media to keep hydrated.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not let the worms sit in media for longer than 7 min, as this will impair the extrusion of gonads during dissection. Perform washes under aid of dissecting microscope to monitor removal of media so that worms are not lost.\nUsing a glass or polyethylene pipette, transfer worms to a 25 mm x 75 mm microscope slide coated with 0.001% poly-L-lysine (slides used in this procedure have an epoxy coated perimeter, leaving three workspaces, 14 mm x 14 mm each). Remove excess media so that approximately 10-15 µL of media remains.",
    "Under the aid of a dissecting microscope and using two 26½ gauge needles, place one needle over the other so that the ends form a pair of scissors. Using needles oriented in this fashion, cut worms behind the pharynx to release the germlines. Dissect all worms within 5 minutes.\n\tNOTE: More detail on how to perform dissections can be found in a previous publication by Gervaise and Arur30.\nAfter all worms are dissected, gently place a 22 mm x 40 mm coverslip over the slide so that it is perpendicular to the slide. The ends of the coverslip should hang off the slide.\nFreeze the slides on a pre-chilled aluminum block maintained on dry ice for at least 20 min. Gently place a chilled pencil on top of the coverslip to prevent the coverslip from becoming loose due to ice expansion.\n4. Fixation/blocking\nWhen ready for fixation, flick off coverslips with a pencil or other blunt-edged tool and immediately dip the slide into a jar containing fresh, ice-cold methanol (chilled to -20 °C) for 1 min.\nGently wipe the edges of the slide that surround the sample so that the next reagent is held by surface tension around the sample. Apply 150 µL of fixative (2% formaldehyde in 100 mM KH2PO4, pH = 7.2) for 5 min at RT.\n\tNOTE: We have also tested a methanol/acetone fixation procedure31,32 and found that it is compatible with the PLA reaction.\nTouch the slide to a paper towel at a perpendicular 90° angle to let the fixative run off the slide and absorb into the paper towel. Block slides 2x for 15 min at RT in a Coplin jar with 50 mL of 1x PBS/1% Triton X-100/1% bovine serum albumin (PBT/BSA).",
    "NOTE: Coplin jars or other types of staining jars are recommended for this blocking step and the washing steps below in sections 6-9. These provide sufficient volumes for efficient exchange of blocking or washing buffer with the sample.\nBlock slides with a PBT/BSA solution containing 10% normal goat serum. Gently wipe edges that surround the slide and apply 100 µL of the solution to the slide. Incubate for 1 h at RT in a humid chamber.\n\tNOTE: This step is highly recommended for staining with the αFLAG primary antibody. The humid chamber is constructed by securing glass pipettes with tape in the tray for the slides to lay on as they incubate. Dampened task wipes (Table of Materials) are placed in the tray to raise the internal humidity of the tray to prevent evaporation. The lid and tray are covered in foil to protect the samples from light during the light-sensitive steps.\nPlace slide on a paper towel to let PBT/BSA/10%NGS solution run off the slide and gently wipe the edges of the slide. Use the blocking reagent (Table of Materials) to block slides. Apply one drop to the 14 mm x 14 mm space. Incubate slides for 1 h at 37 °C in a humid chamber.\n5. Primary antibody incubation\nNOTE: To obtain the best PLA results and minimal background, the dilution factor of the primary antibodies may require optimization (see Discussion for more details). Additionally, the primary antibodies should be raised in different hosts that match the specificity of the secondary antibodies used for PLA.",
    "Place slide on a paper towel to let blocking reagent run off the slide and gently wipe the edges. Use the antibody diluent (Table of Materials) to dilute the primary antibodies. Apply 40 µL of primary antibody solution per 14 mm x 14 mm space.\nIncubate slides in a humid chamber overnight at 4 °C.\n6. PLA probe (secondary antibody) incubation\nNOTE: For steps 6-9, use wash buffers A and B at RT. If the buffers are stored at 4 °C, then let them warm to RT prior to using.\nWash slides 2x for 5 min with 50 mL of 1x wash buffer A (Table of Materials) at RT in a Coplin jar. Set the Coplin jar on an orbital shaker set to 60 rpm.\nPlace slide on a paper towel to let wash buffer run off the slide and gently wipe the edges. Prepare a 40 µL solution containing PLUS and MINUS probes (diluted 1:5 with antibody diluent). Apply the solution to each 14 mm x 14 mm space.\nIncubate slides in a humid chamber for 1 h at 37 °C.\n7. Ligation\nWash slides 2x for 5 min with 50 mL of 1x wash buffer A at RT in a Coplin jar. Set the Coplin jar on an orbital shaker set to 60 rpm.\nDilute the ligation buffer (Table of Materials) 1:5 with ultrapure water. Use this buffer to dilute the ligase (Table of Materials) 1:40 to prepare a working stock of ligation solution.\n\t\nPlace the slide on a paper towel to let the wash buffer run off the slide and gently wipe the edges. Apply 40 µL of the ligation solution to each 14 mm x 14 mm space.\nIncubate slides in a humid chamber for 30 min at 37 °C.\n8. Amplification",
    "NOTE: Using detection reagents with red fluorophores (Table of Materials) results in the least amount of background in C. elegans tissue.\nWash slides 2x for 5 min with 50 mL of 1x wash buffer A at RT in a Coplin jar. Set the Coplin jar on an orbital shaker set to 60 rpm.\nDilute the amplification red buffer (Table of Materials) 1:5 with ultrapure water. Use this buffer to dilute the polymerase (Table of Materials) 1:80 to prepare a working stock of amplification solution and protect from light.\n\t\nPlace the slide on a paper towel to let the wash buffer run off the slide and gently wipe the edges. Apply 40 µL of the amplification solution to each 14mm x 14 mm space.\nIncubate slides in a humid chamber for 1 h and 40 min at 37 °C. Make sure the humid chamber is covered with foil to protect the samples from light.\n9. Final washes\nWash slides 2x for 10 min with 50 mL of 1x wash buffer B (Table of Materials) at RT in a Coplin jar. Set the Coplin jar on an orbital shaker set to 60 rpm.\nWash slides 1x for 1 min with 50 mL of 0.01x wash buffer B at RT in a Coplin jar. Set the Coplin jar on an orbital shaker set to 60 rpm. This buffer is prepared by diluting wash buffer B with ultrapure water.\n10. Coverslip mounting\nLet the excess wash buffer run off the slide onto a paper towel and wipe off any residual buffer remaining on the epoxy-coated perimeter of the slide.\nAdd 10 µL of mounting medium (Table of Materials) to sample and gently lay a coverslip on top, allowing for the mounting medium to spread out.",
    "Paint around the edge of coverslip with nail polish to seal the coverslip and slide. Be gentle with application of nail polish to avoid moving the coverslip, which will damage the germlines. Let the nail polish harden for at least 20 min at RT, while slides are protected from light, before viewing it under a microscope.\nStore slides in a dark container or slide holder, as PLA-labeled samples are light-sensitive. The manufacturer suggests that slides can be stored at -20 °C for long-term storage or at 4 °C for short-term storage. Slides prepared using this protocol will last at least 2 months when stored at 20 °C.\n11. Image acquisition\nFor the purpose of quantification, use a confocal microscope to capture images of extruded germlines that are in clear view, undamaged, and unobstructed. Capture a z-stack of the germline that spans the whole germline in the z-plane and generate a maximum projection image to use for quantitation.\n\tNOTE: Confocal microscopy is ideal for obtaining and quantifying PLA images with less background compared to those obtained using an epifluorescent microscope.\n\t\nIf the germline does not fit in one field of view, capture the overlapping fields of view as necessary to image the whole germline. Maximum projections of these images can be stitched together in FIJI.\nBe sure to keep imaging conditions the same between control and experimental samples to set a fair and proper threshold for identification of foci during image analysis.\n\tNOTE: Record at least 8-10 germlines from each sample per replicate to facilitate statistical analysis of PLA quantification. At least three biological replicates are recommended for PLA to obtain reliable and consistent quantitative results.\n12. Image analysis and quantification using FIJI/ImageJ",
    "NOTE: The following workflow is based on images acquired using the 40x objective on a confocal microscope, in which images are saved in the .czi format. These .czi images and their accompanying metadata, including dimensions, can be accessed and opened in FIJI/ImageJ for further analysis. It should be checked whether FIJI accepts the format of confocal files from the confocal available to the specific user. If not, images in the .tiff format can be alternatively used for analysis, but the user will need to set the scale of the image manually in FIJI/ImageJ (Analyze | Set scale). It is recommended that all negative control images be analyzed together first to establish the level of background.\nStart the analysis workflow by analyzing all negative control images first, then move on to the experimental samples. Open a maximum projection image in FIJI/ImageJ to analyze (Figure 2A). If using a .czi file, a Bio-Formats Import Options box will be prompted.\n\t\nInclude the following options to open your image: view stack with Data Browser; color mode = Colorized. A window with the image should now open with a slide bar to toggle between different channels captured by confocal (e.g., DAPI or PLA).\nIf images need to be stitched, create duplicates of each channel from each image by right-selecting the image with the mouse and selecting Duplicate to open the Duplicate window. Specify only the channel number (c) that corresponds to the PLA or DAPI channel (e.g., 2) and uncheck the box for Duplicate Hyperstack.",
    "With both images to be stitched open, select Plugins | Stitching | Deprecated | 2D stitching. A Stitching of 2D Images window will open. Select which images will be used for stitching and use the default parameters that are preset in the window, then select Ok. The resulting image will be an assembled grayscale image.\n\t\tNOTE: If the sub-images do not perfectly align, adjusting parameters (i.e., increasing the number of peaks to be checked from 5 to 500 or changing the fusion method from Linear Blending to Max. Intensity) may help to obtain the desired image. While other stitching tools are available, this approach retains the dimensionality of the image, which is important for quantification.\nOpen the ROI (Region of Interest) manager by pressing T on the keyboard. A new window named ROI Manager will open.\nSelect the polygon tool from the FIJI toolset box. Drop points around the germline to outline it and generate a ROI (Figure 2B). Connect the last dot to the first to generate a complete ROI.\n\tNOTE: For darker images, it is helpful to adjust the contrast to improve visibility of the germline (which is reversible) so that it can be outlined more accurately.\n\t\nImmediately after completing the ROI, go to the ROI manager and select Add [t] to store the ROI. It is imperative that any changes to the ROI including adding/removing points or movement of the ROI and points be updated (select Update from ROI manager) before proceeding to the next step, or they will be lost. Further detail on manipulation of ROIs and their points can be found in the FIJI/ImageJ User Guide.",
    "Once the ROI orientation is set, it can be saved for later reference by selecting the ROI name in the ROI manager followed by More | Save | (name file and specify destination for where to save). Saved ROIs can be opened in the ROI manager by selecting More | Open | (select the file).\nMeasure the area inside the ROI by selecting the ROI name from the ROI manager, then selecting the Measure button on the ROI manager. A Results window will open with information about the ROI, including the area that it covers in the image (µM2) (inset of Figure 2B). Record this information in a spreadsheet for subsequent calculations.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the scale of the image has been set properly so that the correct dimensions of the ROI are collected. The types of measurements reported in the Results box can be modified by going to Analyze | Set Measurements....\nOpen a duplicate image of only the PLA channel by right-selecting the PLA image and selecting Duplicate (Figure 2C). A Duplicate window will open. Specify only the channel number (c) that corresponds to the PLA channel (e.g., 2) and uncheck the box for Duplicate Hyperstack. Duplication of this image is recommended so that the original image does not get modified.\n\tNOTE: These options will only show up when viewing the images containing multiple channels on FIJI/ImageJ. An alternate approach is to split the channels Image | Color | Split Channels, but this will modify your original image file.",
    "With only the image of PLA channel selected, go to Image | Adjust | Threshold. A Threshold window for the image will open. Select Default as the threshold method, Red as the color, and check the Dark background box. Using the upper track on the window, slide the bar towards the right until all PLA foci are distinctly highlighted in the image.\n\t\nRecord the value in the box to the right of the upper track and take note of what value was used to set the threshold. Select Apply in the Threshold window to finalize the threshold, and the image will convert to a white background with only the threshold foci visible as black dots (Figure 2D). Test the threshold on several negative control images to ensure that it is appropriate for capturing all PLA foci from image to image before quantitation.\n\t\tNOTE: To view threshold foci as black dots on white background, go to Process | Binary | Options… and uncheck the Black background box. A threshold value between 30-40 is a good starting point for identifying PLA in the germline; however, the ideal value may vary depending on background.\nTo quantify the PLA foci, apply the ROI generated from steps 12.3-12.3.1 to the threshold image by selecting the ROI name from the ROI manager window. The outline of the ROI should appear on the image in the same location as it was from the source image (Figure 2E).\n\t\nGo to Analyze | Analyze Particles. The Analyze Particles window will open and select the following parameters: size (micron^2) = 0-Infinity, circularity = 0.00-1.00, show = Nothing. Check the Summarize box.",
    "Select Ok, and a Summary table will appear with information about the ROI (i.e., the total count of PLA foci, total area occupied by the PLA foci inside in the ROI, average size of the PLA foci, and percentage of area occupied by PLA foci relative to the size of the ROI) (inset of Figure 2E). Record these measurements in a spreadsheet.\nRepeat steps 12.1-12.8 for several negative control images using the same threshold.\n\t\nOnce all negative control images have been analyzed, repeat steps 12.1-12.8 for all experimental samples using the same threshold that was determined by the negative control to identify and quantify PLA foci.\nSubscription Required.
