    "Seed 150 mm dishes with 8-9 x 106 BHK or C6/36 cells in 15 ml of complete MEM. For wild-type alphavirus purification, 2-3 150 mm dishes are routinely used in our lab.Grow BHK cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and C6/36 cells at 28 °C in 5% CO2 for 2-4 days until cells are > 95% confluent.Remove media using a serological pipette.Infect cells with alphavirus stock at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 5 plaque-forming units per cell. Make up the final volume to 5 ml with Supplemented VP-SFM.Rock for 1 h at speed control of 25 (on Reliable model 55 rocker) at room temperature so the virus has time to adhere and enter into cells. One-hour adsorption time is enough for both BHK and C6/36 cells.Remove media containing the virus.Add 5-10 ml PBS (equilibrated to room temperature) and tilt back and forth manually to wash the cells.Pipette off PBS.Repeat the PBS wash 2 more times. The goal is to remove as much of the MEM complete media as possible to avoid interference of residual FBS with the purification.Add 15 ml of room temperature Supplemented VP-SFM to each 150 mm plate.Incubate cells at an appropriate growth temperature. Media from BHK infected cells will be ready to harvest around 18-22 h post-infection. You should observe cytopathic effects and cell rounding, but minimal cell death (Figure 1). Prolonged incubation after the onset of the cytopathic effect will increase cell death and decrease virus yield. Infections in C6/36 cells incubate for 5 days but a cytopathic effect does not develop. After 2.5 days post-infection, add 5 ml of Supplemented VP-SFM media to the cells to supply additional nutrients. On day 5, collect the media and continue the next step.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180314/20180314185328_9070.jpgFigure 1. Display of CPE in BHK cells.",
    "Cells on the left (A) are uninfected and healthy whereas those on the right (B) have been infected with Sindbis virus for 20 h. Notice the cell rounding but yet minimal cell death. Images are at the same magnification (4,000x).Collect all the media in a 50 ml conical tube and clarify by centrifuging at 4,000 x g for 5 min, 4 °C. This step removes cell debris and dead cells. Transfer the supernatant into a new 50 ml conical tube.At this step, the sample can be kept at 4 °C. In our lab, we do not store the sample for more than 2 days. Do not freeze the sample as there is no serum present and the enveloped virus particles will be damaged.To purify the virus, centrifuge at 5,300 x g for 16 h at 15 °C. Use a fixed angle rotor in a refrigerated table-top centrifuge. Do not stop the centrifugation unless you are ready to continue with the subsequent steps immediately.Stop the centrifuge and, as you remove the tubes from the rotor, circle the position where the pellets have been collected on the side of the tube. The pellets are translucent at best, and are usually formed where the side and cone of the 50 ml conical tube meet (Figure 2). It can help to mark the wall of the tube for the following steps.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180314/20180314185521_2382.jpgFigure 2. Position of pelleted viruses in centrifugation tubes after LSC. When using a fixed-angle rotor, the pelleted virus will appear as a clear, transparent pellet (blue dots) on the upper wall of the conical tube. Carefully decant the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.Invert the conical tube onto a paper towel and let residual media drain down.",
    "Using a Kimwipe and a cotton swab, wipe dry the sides and bottom of the conical tube being careful not to disturb the pellet.Add 20-50 µl of the buffer of choice. PBS works well for biochemical assays and cryo-EM imaging but interferes with negative stain TEM. HNE buffer is good for both cryo-EM and negative stain TEM imaging. Volatile buffers such as ammonium acetate (100 mM, pH 7.5) are ideal for mass spectrometry applications.Store the resuspended virus sample at 4 °C; do not freeze. Note that over time particles may precipitate out of solution. We have stored viruses for up to 1 year and have not noticed degradation by SDS-PAGE or TEM analysis."
