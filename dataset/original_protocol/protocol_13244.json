    "The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (approval number: 2020-29).\n1. Experimental animals\nRaise 18, 6-month-old normal-grade male New Zealand rabbits (2.75 ± 0.25 kg) in standard single cages (12 h light/dark cycle, temperature 20-24 °C, air humidity 40%-60%).\n2. Grouping method\nSelect 6 out of the 18 New Zealand rabbits as the sham group using the random number method and assign the remaining 12 rabbits to the modeling group.\nAfter successful modeling, divide the modeling group rabbits into the model and Tuina groups according to the random number method, with 6 rabbits in each group.\nPerform the Tuina intervention in the Tuina group. Perform the same grasping and fixation in the sham and model group without Tuina. Operate every other day for 4 weeks (Figure 1).\n3. Establishment of the KOA model\nPerform adaptive feeding to rabbits in the standard condition in week 1. Ad libitum access to water and food. Place rabbits on their right sides in the rabbit fixation boxes to calm them down for 15 min a day. Fix their heads on the head-fixing plates. Fix the fastening plates and screws so the rabbits cannot move. Wear protective gloves when grasping and fixing the rabbits (Figure 1).\nOn days 1, 4, and 7 of week 2, place all 18 rabbits on their right sides in the rabbit fixation boxes (Figure 1). Perform the below-mentioned operations.\nInject 3% pentobarbital sodium (1 ml/kg) into the rabbit's marginal ear vein. Shave the rabbit's left knee joint with an animal shaver, resulting in no hair on the exposed skin.\nDisinfect the rabbit's left knee joint from the inside out using medical iodophor and 75% alcohol (Figure 2A).",
    "Flex the rabbit's left knee joint at 60°. Insert a needle (22G, 0.7 mm x 30 mm) from Waixiyan. Inject 4% papain solution (0.1 mL/kg, 0.275 mL on average for a 2.5 kg animal) into the knee joint cavity of the modeling group. Inject an equal amount of 0.9% sodium chloride solution into the sham group. This injection dose is well-tolerated by the animal without causing evidence of pain or distress (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: Waixiyan (EX-LE5) is located in the patellar ligament's lateral recess, and Neixiyan (EX-LE4) is located in the medial recess of the patellar ligament20,21,22.\nPress the pinhole for 2 min to avoid solution spillage.\nPlace your hands above and below the rabbit's left knee joint. Gently and passively flex the rabbit's knee joint and extend 10 times within the physiological range of motion (ROM) to infiltrate the solution into the knee joint cavity evenly15.Observe the rabbit every 8 h for the duration of the modeling. Administer buprenorphine SR (0.18 mg/kg) when the rabbits show signs of hiding, trembling of limbs, shallow and rapid breathing, or even biting and scratching.\nAt week 7, observe the rabbit's left knee in a flexed position as swollen, with increased muscle tone around the knee with nodules and striae, increased local painful irritation response, decreased knee ROM, lame gait, and shift of the center of gravity to the healthy side. This determines the success of the KOA model (Figure 1, Figure 2C)23,24.\n4. Tuina manipulation\nPerform training using the Tuina technique parameter determination instrument before Tuina manipulation. Train for 1 h a day for 1 month by the same professional.\n\t\nPerform the rotatory kneading and pressing method with the thumb on the Tuina manipulation simulation platform with a force of 5 N and a frequency of 60 times/min (Figure 3A,C).",
    "Analyze the force in three directions of X, Y, and Z axes by the Tuina manipulation parameter processing software and check the force's magnitude, frequency, and time of action displayed on the screen (Figure 3B, D).\nEvaluate the mechanical parameters of the Tuina manipulation and standardize the Tuina manipulation using the software during training. Maintain the standardized rotatory kneading and pressing method with the thumb with a force of 5 N, a frequency of 60 times/min, and a continuous operating time of 10 min. See the standardized quantitative waveform of the manipulation in Figure 3B,D25,26,27.\nPlace the rabbit on its right side in the rabbit fixation box. Gently stroke the rabbit for 10s to soothe and relax the rabbit21. Then perform the Tuina intervention.\nPerform the rotatory kneading method with the thumb on the rabbit's left peri-knee muscles stiffness, tendon knots, and patella, with up and down round-trip manipulation at a force of 5 N and a frequency of 60 times/min for 5 min.\nUse the thumb end to press Yanglingquan (GB 34), Yinlingquan (SP 9), Waixiyan (EX-LE5), Neixiyan (EX-LE4), Heding (EX-LE2), Xuehai (SP 10), Liangqiu (ST 34), and Weizhong (BL 40)20,21,22, with a force of 5 N and a frequency of 60 times/min, and operate on each point for 30 s.\nPerform the rotary correction method on the rabbit knee joint and perform this 3x separately for each animal in the group.\n\t\nFix the femur with one hand. Place the other hand behind the knee joint first, then fix the lateral and medial tibial condyles with the thumb and ring fingers, respectively. Fix the popliteal fossa with the index and middle fingers. Apply traction and twisting force.",
    "Fix the femur with one hand. Fix the patella's medial and lateral edges with the thumb and little fingers of the other hand. Fix the patellar base with the index, middle, and ring fingers. Apply twisting force.\nKeep the direction of traction force parallel to the long axis of the tibia, and the direction of torsion force in line with the direction of the lower Xiyan. Use fingers to hold the skin in place to avoid friction between the skin and fingers.\n5. Measurement of the knee joint ROM\nNOTE: Before measurement, calm the rabbit. The measurement statistician and operator are different from one another.\nMeasure the mobility of the left knee joint of rabbits of each group at the beginning of the experiment and the end of each week.\nPosition the rabbit on its right side in the rabbit fixation box and fix its left femur with one hand.\nAlign the center of the circle of the medical arthroscope with the lateral center of the rabbit's left knee joint. Extend the fixation arm such that it is parallel to the line extension connecting the circle's center to the greater trochanter. Extend the mobile arm such that it is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tibia.\nPlace the other hand on the longitudinal axis of the tibia, approximately 9 cm from the knee joint. Manually apply approximately 750-850 g torque at an angular velocity of 3°/s28.\nPerform this till the rabbit's knee joint is no longer moving . Record the number of degrees the goniometer displays when the joint stops moving; this is the knee joint ROM. When reading, ensure the line of sight is perpendicular to the ruler's surface.\nMeasure ROM for each knee 3x and take the average value28.\n6. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining\nSample collection",
    "At 1 week from the end of the intervention (Figure 1), place the rabbit on its right side in the rabbit fixation box (rabbits are more likely to remain relaxed when lying on their right side). Inject pentobarbitone (100 mg/kg) into the rabbit's ear marginal vein for humane euthanasia29,30.\nOpen the left knee cavity quickly with a scalpel, scissors, and hemostatic forceps to remove the soft tissue attached around the cartilage of the distal femur.\nCollect an approximately 1 cm x 1 cm cartilage-bone specimen of the distal femur with biting forceps and place it in saline for cleaning.\nFixation and decalcification\n\t\nPlace the cartilage in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and fix it for 72 h.\nRinse in running water for 12 h. Decalcify in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) decalcification solution for 6 weeks. Change the EDTA decalcification solution every 3 days. Determine the end point of decalcification when the bone tissue becomes soft and flexible, can be easily bent, and pierced smoothly with a needle31.\nDehydration of embedded sections\n\t\nPlace the specimen in an automatic dehydrator for dehydration.\nPlace the waxed and trimmed tissue on the bottom of a square container with dissolved paraffin wax for 1 h. Place them in a cooling oven until cooled and solidified into hard blocks. Slice the paraffin-embedded tissue block in a slicer to a thickness of 4 µm.\nUnfold the sections in the bleach machine, then place them on adhesive slides, number them, and dry them with a slice baking machine and oven.\nDe-waxing and hydration\n\t\nBake the sections at 65 °C for 60 min.\nSoak the sections in xylene for 7 min, followed by 2 more rounds of soaking in fresh xylene for 7 min each.",
    "Soak the slice in anhydrous ethanol for 5 min, followed by soaking for 2 min each in 95% ethanol, 85% ethanol, and 75% ethanol.\nSoak sections in distilled water for 2 min.\nHematoxylin staining: Stain sections with hematoxylin for 20 s. Rinse sections in running water. Soak sections in hydrochloric acid ethanol fractionation for 3 s. Rinse sections in tap water for 5 min.\nEosin re-staining: Stain sections with eosin for 30 s. Rinse sections with tap water.\nDehydration for transparency of the sample\n\t\nPlace sections in 95% ethanol twice for 3 s each, followed by placing in anhydrous ethanol for 3 s.\nAgain, place the slices in anhydrous ethanol for 1 min, followed by 2 rounds of xylene wash for 1 min each.\nSealing of slices: Take out the slices, drop neutral gum sealer, cover with a coverslip, and leave the slices to dry in a fume hood until odorless.\nPhotographing the sample: Observe and photograph under the field of view of a light microscope at 100x.\nEvaluation: Evaluate the cartilage tissue by Mankin's score for each group32.\n7. Data analysis\nAnalyze statistically the experimental data using analysis software. When the data were subjected to a normal distribution, compare two groups of samples by t-test and multiple groups by one-way ANOVA.\nExpress results as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Represent results as statistical plots using commercial software. Differences were statistically significant at p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
