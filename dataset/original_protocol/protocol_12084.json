    "These studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health and animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine under protocol number AN-4203.\n1. Preparation of the Pregnant Mouse for Ultrasound\nTimed mating\nPlace the dam with a proven fertile male mouse overnight beginning after 1700. Separate dam and male by 0700 hours (h), regardless if vaginal plug is present, to ensure accurate dating of pregnancy.\n\t\tNOTE: The morning after mating is considered 0.5 day post coitum (d.p.c.).\nPreparation for ultrasound\nPlace the pregnant mouse in a sealed anesthesia induction container.\nSedate with isoflurane (2%) inhaled anesthetic and oxygen (1 L/min) until the animal loses the righting reflex (approximately 1-2 min depending on the size of the mouse) and spontaneous movements are not observed (besides respiration).\nPlace sedated mouse in supine position in nose cone with isoflurane (2%) inhaled anesthetic and oxygen (1 L/min). Apply ophthalmic ointment to the animal's eyes.\nWith a cotton swab, apply depilatory cream to entire abdomen, sternum to vagina, and lateral to the flanks.\nAllow cream to remain for a maximum of 3 min, and then remove cream and hair with tissue. Ensure that all hair is removed, as any remaining hair will decrease image quality.\n2. Preparation of the Ultrasound Stage\nTurn on the transducer.\nAttach 3-D motor stage motor stage to the transducer.\nPlug into 3D motor by connecting the 3D motor cable to the 3D motor connector on the rear panel. Attach the 3D motor system to the mounting system using the quick release post on the top to connect to the imaging station, and the quick release mount on the bottom to affix the transducer clamp.",
    "Attach the probe to the transducer clamp.\n3. Begin Imaging the Pregnant Mouse\nPlace mouse supine on the monitoring platform. The mouse continuously receives isoflurane anesthetic (between 1.5-2.5%) and oxygen (1 L/min) via the nose cone. Gently tape all paws to heart rate monitoring pads on the platform.\nApply 1-2 mL of ultrasound transmission gel on abdomen.\nUsing the manual motor stage, position the ultrasound probe on the lower abdomen.\nLocate the bladder, which should appear as a fluid-filled dark circle just cephalad to the vaginal opening.\nOnce the bladder is located, move the probe very slowly cephalad to visualize the pregnant uterus, which should appear as a cylindrical shape with round areas at pregnancy sites. This can be described as looking like pearls on a chain.\nOnce the pregnant uterus has been identified, begin 2-D imaging.\n4. The 2-D Ultrasound Imaging (Figure 1)\nOnce the pregnant uterus has been identified, begin at the pregnancy site closest to the bladder and slowly and sequentially move cephalad to determine number and location of pregnancy sites.\nIf the kidney, spleen, or liver are visualized, reposition the probe closer caudal (closer to the bladder) as the user has gone too far cephalad.\nImage the contralateral uterine horn in the same manner.\nFreeze the image when the ultrasound frame is in the center of the implantation/pregnancy site to save for later analysis and measurements.\n\tNOTE: It takes less than one second for the image to be frozen and saved for later analysis.",
    "Measure implantation distance using the hyperechoic decidualization reaction as a marker by manually clicking on the \"measure\" tool first, and then clicking on the location of one implantation site. Next, drag the cursor to next implantation site and click to draw a line that the computer will automatically report its distance. The software will then report what the manual measurement is. This step is not computerized, but relies on the user to mark the distance between decidualized sites by drawing a line between the decidualized sites, which the program will provide a measurement for.\nMeasure implantation size, gestational sac size, and fetal pole size.\n5. Fetal Heart Rate\nNOTE: At 9.5 d.p.c., the fetal heart beat should be clearly visualized.\nWhile keeping the probe very still, turn on the pulse wave Doppler and position this over the visible heartbeat.\nRecord the cardiac heart beat pulsations.\n\tNOTE: Apart from the heart, this procedure can also record pulsations in the umbilical cord.\n6. 3-D Ultrasound Acquisition\nAfter the pregnant uterus has been visualized on 2-D imaging, position the probe in an area that is in the approximate mid-point of the desired 3-D image. For example, if one were imaging an apple in 3-D, the probe should initially be placed where the apple core is predicted to be located (i.e. middle of object).\nWith the probe in a position in the middle of the desired image, obtain a 3-D acquisition. The 3-D motor stage will travel this distance across the uterus in a series of steps or frames, with the intention of capturing in entirety what the investigator desires.",
    "Confirm that the intended structures are completely captured in the 3-D scanning before completing the real-time ultrasound portion. Save this 3-D information for post-processing at a later time. The total time for 2-D and 3-D ultrasound acquisition is approximately 10-20 minutes when performed by an experienced user.\n7. 3-D Reconstitution Post-processing (Figure 2)\nLoad the desired data for 3-D image processing.\nChoose \"parallel and rotational methods\", which will load all the 3D image frames into one 3-D \"box\" that the user will then trace the desired object in, frame-by-frame. Choose step size 0.08 mL. Begin at one end of the image block and scroll through to familiarize with the images that have been captured within space.\nStart at one end of the image and manually trace the outline of the object.\nScroll to next 2-D image slice or \"frame\" and manually trace the outline of the object.\nContinue this process until all frames have been manually annotated/traced by the user.\nClick \"finish\" to obtain the 3-D image and total volume calculations.\nChoose between mesh and solid overlay, which is an arrow in the top left corner.\nChoose to keep or remove the surrounding ultrasound image information for clarity. Each 3-D reconstruction may take between 10 and 20 min.\n8. Post-procedural Care\nWhen the ultrasound is complete, turn off the anesthesia gas, remove the mouse from the platform and gently wipe and wash away any ultrasound gel from the animal.\nPlace the mouse back in the cage in a prone position in a padded area. Monitor until the animal is awake and moving spontaneously.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
