    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPlasma collection\nTiming: 1 h\nThe first step involves blood collection to retrieve the optimal volume of plasma in a quick and preserved fashion.\nMouse preparation.\nAnesthetize the mouse with ketamine and xylazine (in a dedicated room for sampling and euthanasia).\nNote: Deep anesthesia is reached with 150 μL per 10 g of animal of a cocktail of ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally. This deep anesthesia in living animals is needed to collect blood, as undesired blood coagulation starts immediately at death.\nWait for at least 10 min to allow sedation.\nMoisten hairs with ethanol 70%.\nIncise the skin to make a buttonhole facing the upper part of the thoracic cage at the level of the first ribs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3176-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Step-by-step recovery of mouse plasma by intracardiac puncture\n(A) Surgical field with anesthetized mouse and all materials required for intracardiac puncture step. 1: microtubes containing 30 μL EDTA 0.5 M. 2: anesthetized mouse with moistened hair and skin with ethanol 70%. 3: Semken tweezer curved. 4: surgical scissors. 5: syringe with 25G needle flushed with EDTA 0.5 M.\n(B) Skin incision as buttonhole and puncture site located on the left side between the first and the second ribs.\n(C) Homogenized total blood in EDTA 0.5 M microtubes, sitting at 16°C–25°C for less than 2 h.\n(D) After centrifugation at 1,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, supernatant plasma is separated as a transparent yellow upper phase.\nIntracardiac puncture.\nPrepare 1.5 mL microtubes with 30 μL EDTA 0.5 M (5% of the mean expected blood collection volume) and a 1 mL syringe with 25G or 26G needle flushed with the EDTA just before plasma collection. A dry EDTA collecting tube can be used as well (commercial purple tube).",
    "Note: The type of blood collection tube (EDTA, citrate, heparin, etc.) impacts platelet activation and EV recovery, and therefore must be carefully selected. ACD-A (acid citrate dextrose), EDTA, and citrate tubes offering the best performances according to a recent benchmarking study by Dhondt et al.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nLocalize the puncture area: Depending on mouse strain, it is usually between the first and second ribs on the left side toward the axis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAt the beginning of the puncture, apply a gentle suction as the syringe penetrates the muscle layer.\nNote: This generates a vacuum effect enabling the blood to promptly ascend in the syringe once the needle reaches the adequate depth in the heart. Thus, this technique allows harvesting quickly “fresh and clean” blood with minimal intervention on the animal (i.e., without opening up the thoracic cavity).\nSlowly suck up 500 μL to 1 mL of blood from the heart.\nTransfer quickly the collected blood into the EDTA tube.\nNote: tubes can sit at 16°C–25°C for a maximum of 2 h, whether several blood samples need to be collected.\nImmediately after blood collection, euthanize the mouse according to approved procedures.\nNote: The expected mean volume of collected blood is 600 μL. While an occasional experimenter can recover 300 μL, an advanced operator can expect to recover around 1 mL of blood. As plasma accounts for 60% of total blood volume, it is expected up to 600 μL of plasma per mouse. Thus, the described protocol here may allow individual immunoblot analysis for example. However, plasma from replicate animals can be pooled if higher volumes are required.\nSeparation of plasma from total blood.\nCentrifuge EDTA tubes at 1,000 g for 15 min at 4°C to enable separation of plasma from blood cells and platelets.",
    "Optional: Residual platelets in plasma can release elevated amounts of confounding EVs following freezing and thawing.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] To maximize platelet separation, a second centrifugation step ≥ 1,000 g can be performed.\nPipet carefully the supernatant, transfer it into a new collection tube, and snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen.\nStore at −80°C for further isolation or analysis.\nCritical: The plasma color has to be transparent yellow rather than red, which indicates hemolysis and poor quality of puncture.\nPause point: Mouse plasma can be stored at −80°C for several months to years before EV separation.\nExtracellular vesicle preparation\nTiming: 4–24 h\nIn this step, we present three alternative strategies that can be used to separate and enrich EVs from mouse plasma with different specificity and yield depending on desired applications. As described here, all EV separations can be performed upon plasma thawing, following i) differential ultracentrifugation (UC), ii) size exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with UC, or, iii) SEC combined with density gradient (DG) and UC.\nNote: Extracellular vesicles should be separated from other plasma constituents with overlapping physical properties, consisting mainly of lipoprotein particles and non-EV protein complexes from plasma.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] The applied procedure should take into account the yield and purity required for downstream analysis.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] While the sequential, combinatory implementation of separation methods improves EV separation from non-EV constituents, it also decreases the yield (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). This can be particularly critical for biological samples with small input volumes, such as mouse plasma.\nPlasma pre-processing: Thaw at least 200 μL of plasma on ice (can be enough for options 1 and 2; should be as close as possible to 600 μL for option 3).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3176-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Overview of the different EV enrichment options to recover circulating EVs from mouse plasma",
    "(A) Separation steps to isolate EVs from mouse plasma: three optional procedures are depicted: 1: differential ultracentrifugation, 2: Size exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation, 3: Size exclusion chromatography followed by density gradient and ultracentrifugation.\n(B) The three optional enrichment protocols i.e., differential ultracentrifugation (UC), size exclusion chromatography and ultracentrifugation (SEC+UC), and, size exclusion chromatography followed by density gradient and ultracentrifugation (SEC+DG+UC) allow either high recovery or high purity EV preparations, suitable for EV characterization and further dedicated analysis.\nNote: Plasma from replicate mice can be pooled to increase volume and improve sensibility/yield.\n(Option 1) Differential ultracentrifugation.\nDilute 200 μL (or more if available) of freshly thawed plasma in ice-cold particle-free PBS to a final volume of 2 mL.\nTransfer diluted plasma in a 2 mL microtube and centrifuge at 2,000 g for 10 min, 4°C, to pellet large unwanted particles.\nPipet the supernatant and transfer into a new 2 mL microtube and centrifuge at 10,000 g for 30 min, 4°C, to pellet large EVs (discard pellet or save as the 10 K fraction).\nPipet the supernatant and transfer into a 2 mL open-top polypropylene tube and centrifuge at 100,000 g for 2 h, 4°C, to pellet small EVs (maximum acceleration: 0; maximum deceleration: 0).\nTo wash small EVs:\nCarefully discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet (invisible) in 1 mL of ice-cold particle-free PBS.\nFill the tube up to 2 mL with particle-free PBS.\nPerform additional centrifugation at 100,000 g for 2 h, 4°C (maximum acceleration: 0; maximum deceleration: 0).\nCritical: Salts contained in PBS buffer may scatter light and possibly interfere with particle analysis methods. As aforementioned, we recommend the use of 0.22 μm-filtered PBS or commercial sterile particle-free PBS to wash and resuspend EVs. The absence of confounding particles in PBS should be controlled before any particle quantification.",
    "Carefully discard the supernatant by pipetting it out or by slow aspiration from the opposite side of the tube.\nNote: To make sure not to disturb the pellet, never pipette or aspirate close by the pellet side (fixed-angle rotor).\nResuspend the pellet (invisible) in a low volume of ice-cold particle-free PBS (30–100 μL).\nProceed to quality control and EV characterization. Please see ‘expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]’ section.\nPause point: At that time, isolated EVs can be frozen at −80°C until analysis. Freezing and long-term storage impact EV integrity and downstream characterization,12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] we recommend performing EV analysis on fresh preparations when possible. Temporary storage should be at 4°C during workday, as most steps described in this protocol (except SEC column and particle characterization done by ILM).\nCritical: Although commonly implemented, differential UC is known to separate EVs with low specificity, recovering a significant amount of non-EV particles and protein complexes.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] Additionally, high-speed pelleting enables a limited recovery of EVs and may impact their integrity.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\n(Option 2) Size exclusion chromatography.\nCentrifuge at least 200 μL and up to 600 μL of freshly thawed plasma at 10,000 g for 30 min, 4°C, to pellet large particles.\nMeanwhile, equilibrate a size exclusion chromatography column at 16°C–25°C with particle-free PBS following the manufacturer’s instructions https://files.izon.com/hubfs/Manuals, Technical Notes and Customer Support/qEV columns/qEVoriginal_Gen_2_User_Manual-ICO-DQ-001.pdf[href=https://files.izon.com/hubfs/Manuals,%20Technical%20Notes%20and%20Customer%20Support/qEV%20columns/qEVoriginal_Gen_2_User_Manual-ICO-DQ-001.pdf].\nNote: While commercial columns might help standardization and reproducibility, such as Izon qEVoriginal/70 nm used here, SEC columns with similar properties can also be handmade, based on this published method.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nCollect 500 μL of plasma supernatant to transfer onto the SEC column (if starting with 200 μL of plasma, collect 150 μL of supernatant and adjust to 500 μL with particle-free PBS).\nElute the column by adding ice-cold particle-free PBS on the top once the sample enters the column.",
    "Discard the void volume (2.9 mL) and collect the two first 500 μL EV-enriched SEC fractions 1 and 2 (F1 and F2). Automate might help standardization and reproducibility (such as Izon AFC).\nOptional: EV-enriched SEC fractions can be used directly to monitor particle and protein elution as described expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section.\nPool F1+F2 EV-enriched SEC fractions to obtain 1 mL.\nRecovered EVs can be concentrated, if required, using ultracentrifugation (steps i. to iv.) or ultrafiltration (step v.):\nDilute pooled EV-enriched SEC fractions to 11 mL with cold particle-free PBS in a 13.2 mL thinwall polypropylene tube.\nPellet EVs by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 2 h, 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant by pipetting it out or by slow aspiration from the opposite side of the tube.\nNote: To make sure not to disturb the pellet, never pipette or aspirate close by the center of the tube, and leave a drop of supernatant.\nResuspend the final pellet in 30–100 μL of cold particle-free PBS for further storage and analysis. Alternatively, lyse the pellet in 30 μL of boiling 2× denaturation SDS sample buffer for immunoblotting.\nConcentrate EV-enriched fractions by ultrafiltration using 2 mL Amicon concentrators with regenerated cellulose and 10 kDa MWCO.\nCritical: The molecular weight cutoff and membrane composition of the ultrafiltration devices both impact the recovery of EVs and should be carefully selected.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nProceed to quality control and EV characterization. Please see the ‘expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]’ section.\nPause point: At that time, isolated EVs can be frozen at −80°C until analysis. Freezing and long-term storage impact EV integrity and downstream characterization,12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] we recommend performing EV analysis in fresh preparations when possible.\n(Option 3) Size exclusion chromatography and density gradient.",
    "Perform SEC separation as described in step 6 a-f of this protocol to obtain 1 mL of SEC fractions F1 and F2. If needed, adjust to a final volume of 1 mL with cold particle-free PBS.\nNote: The density gradient protocol described hereafter has been adapted from the already described protocol4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] to be used with SW41Ti rotor and 13.2 mL thinwall polypropylene tubes.\nPrepare iodixanol (OptiPrep, 50% w/v) working solution (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]) by mixing five volumes of iodixanol (OptiPrep, 60% w/v) stock solution with 1 volume of previously prepared working buffer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3176_4.csv\nNote: Iodixanol (OptiPrep) working solution should be freshly prepared, kept on ice, and protected from light.\nPrepare 5%, 10%, 20%, and 40% iodixanol solutions as described in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] using previously prepared homogenization buffer (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]), and iodixanol working solution (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3176_5.csv\nNote: The iodixanol solutions should be freshly prepared and kept on ice while building the gradient. Indicated volumes of iodixanol solutions can be used to prepare 3 gradients of 10.5 mL (sample volume included) as described hereinafter.\nIn a new 13.2 mL thinwall polypropylene tube, dispose gently 3 mL of 40% iodixanol solution (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3176-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Mouse plasma EV separation by density gradient\n(A) Loading of iodixanol solutions in an ultracentrifugation tube.\n(B) Layers of 5, 10, 20, and 40% iodixanol solutions in a 13.2 mL ultracentrifugation tube on which 1 mL of SEC fractions F1+F2 (EV enriched fractions) were loaded on the top.\n(C) Density of each density gradient fractions of 1 mL collected from the top was measured at 340 nm for iodixanol absorbance, as described by Dhondt et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]",
    "(D) Immunoblot analysis of each density gradient fraction of 1 mL (1 to 10 from the top) processed from 500 μL of mouse plasma with size exclusion chromatography, density gradient, and ultracentrifugation (SEC+DG+UC), and resolved on Tris-acetate gel. Luminal Alix and transmembrane CD9 were analyzed as EV markers. Apolipoprotein ApoB and plasma protein albumin served as contamination controls. Primary antibodies were incubated at 1:1000 in PBS-Tween 5% milk for 12–18 h at 4°C. Secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies were diluted at 1:5000, incubated for 1 h at 16°C–25°C, and revealed by chemiluminescence.\nGently tilt the tube horizontally and add dropwise 2.5 mL of 20% iodixanol solution, followed by 2.5 mL of 10%, and 1.5 mL of 5% iodixanol solutions.\nNote: For a video illustration of layering density gradient iodixanol fractions, please see the published STAR Protocols.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nCarefully add dropwise 1 mL of pooled EV-rich SEC fractions generated at step 7a.\nCentrifuge density gradients at 100,000 g for 18 h, 4°C (maximum acceleration: 0; slow deceleration: 9).\nCritical: A slow deceleration is required at the end of the centrifugation to preserve the density gradient formed during the 16–18 h run (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). A smooth handling of the tubes following the centrifugation is also essential to avoid disturbing the gradient and recover EV in their expected density fractions.\nMeticulously collect from the top 1 mL density gradient fractions with a P1000 pipet in new 1.5 mL microtubes.\nCritical: Pipet fractions from the center of the meniscus using a smooth and precise P1000 pipet, maintaining the immerged part of the tip at 1–2 mm below the surface of the liquid to avoid mixing gradient fractions.\nNote: For a video illustration of density gradient fractions collection, please see the STAR Protocols from Dhondt et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]",
    "Optional: Measure the density of collected gradient fractions using fractions collected from a blank PBS-loaded density gradient prepared at step 7b-e. Density can be determined using a plate reader by measuring the absorbance of iodixanol at 340 nm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). For detailed instructions, please see the STAR Protocols of Dhondt et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nEVs accumulate at a density of ≈1.085–1.110 g/mL, corresponding here to fractions 5 and 6 collected from the top. These EV-rich fractions were analyzed by western blot (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nPool EV-enriched density gradient fractions and dilute them in a new 13.2 mL thinwall polypropylene tube to 11 mL with cold particle-free PBS.\nPellet EVs by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 2 h, 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant by pipetting it out or by slow aspiration from the side of the tube, and resuspend the final pellet in 30–100 μL of cold particle-free PBS. Alternatively, lyse the pellet in boiling 2× denaturation SDS sample buffer for immunoblotting.\nProceed to quality control and EV characterization. Please see the ‘expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]’ section.\nNote: Due to the low yield, we do not advise freezing EV preparations that have been resuspended in PBS at this step."
