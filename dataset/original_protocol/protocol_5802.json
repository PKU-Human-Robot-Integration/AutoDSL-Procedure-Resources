    "Casting the BN-PA gel (linear gradient 3.5%-12.5% separation gel; 3% stacking gel)Assemble gel caster (e.g., Hoefer) with 10 x 8 cm plates (Figure 1A) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Any vertical electrophoresis system with any compatible casting unit can be used.Prepare the light (3.5% AA) and heavy (12.5% AA) buffers from the acrylamide stock solution A (48% acrylamide, 1.5% Bis-acrylamide) (see Recipes). Keep the solutions on ice to prevent untimely polymerization. Cast the gel between a glass plate and a notched aluminum oxide plate (10 x 8 cm) with a gradient maker (Figure 1B). Use 0.75 mm T-spacer for the 1D-BN-PAGE and 1 mm T-spacer for 2D-BN-PAGE. Allow the gradient gel to polymerize for 1-2 h at RT.Cast the stacking gel (3% acrylamide) using the acrylamide stock solution B (20% acrylamide, 5% Bis-acrylamide). Use an appropriate sample gel comb (1D-BN-PA gel: standard comb with 10 wells, 2D-BN-PA gel: 2D-comb). Allow the stacking gel to polymerize for 30-60 min. Remove the sample gel comb under MQ-water. Store the gel at 4 °C. PAUSE POINT: The gel can be stored at 4 °C at least for few days. The gel must not dry. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180628/20180628190236_9555.jpgFigure 1. Equipment for casting gradient gels. A.

Gradient maker, IPC-pump and gel assembled and ready for gel casting.Solubilization of thylakoid membranes (Perform the solubilization under dim light)Resuspend thylakoids equivalent to 3-7 µg chlorophyll in ACA buffer to a chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/ml.Add an equal volume of detergent buffer A (4% digitonin/ACA) on the sample and solubilize at RT with continuous gentle mixing for 10 min, e.g., in a shaker. The final chlorophyll concentration is 0.5 mg/ml.",
    "Pellet the insolubilized material by centrifugation at 18,000 x g, at 4 °C, for 20 min, remove the supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube. Add 1/10 of CBB-buffer to the sample and carefully mix with a pipet. Avoid making air bubbles.Separation of the protein complexes with 1D-BN-PAGEAssemble the gel to the vertical electrophoresis system and pour ~70 ml of blue cathode buffer to the gel tank (upper chamber), and ~100 ml of anode buffer to the lower chamber (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180628/20180628222707_6531.jpgFigure 2. Example of the gradient gel assembly. The gel is assembled in the SE 250 Mini-Vertical electrophoresis unit.Load thylakoids equivalent to 2-5 µg of chlorophyll to the sample well.Start the electrophoretic run by gradually increasing the voltage as follows:75 V 30 min100 V 30 min125 V 30 min 150 V 60 min175 V 30 minPerform the electrophoresis at 4 °CAs the blue running front has moved about one third (at ~100-125 V) of the desired running distance, remove the blue cathode buffer from the upper chamber and replace it with a clear cathode buffer.Stop the electrophoresis, when the protein complexes (B1-B9) (see Figure 6A) are separated and the gel is clear from the blue cathode. Scan the gel with a photo scanner (keep the gel between the glass and alumina plates while scanning), remove the glass plate and carefully cut out the lane containing the separated protein complexes using a spacer (see sketch in Figure 3). Do not use scalpel or any other sharp object for cutting to avoid scratching the alumina plate. PAUSE POINT: It is possible to store the BN-gel strip at -80 °C, but do not shock-freeze the strip with liquid nitrogen.",
    "Notes:  The amount of chlorophyll loaded on the gel depends on the subsequent analysis: for immunoblotting, load 2 µg (or less) of chlorophyll and for the 3D-SDS-PAGE, load 5 µg or more chlorophyll. It is possible to also excise individual bands (complexes B1-B9) from the BN-PA-gel, re-solubilize the bands in Eppendorf-tubes with 1% β-DM and subject them to 2D-BN-PAGE. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180628/20180628191125_5141.jpgFigure 3. Preparation of 1D-BN-strip for 2D-BN-PAGE. (1) After finishing 1D-BN-PAGE, remove the glass plate and excise the lane containing the protein complexes (B1-B9) using e.g., the T-spacer. (2) Carefully place the gel strip to a 5 ml culture tube containing 2 ml of detergent buffer B (1% β-DM). Solubilize in a shaker for 40 min. (3) Place the gel strip on the second BN-PA gel (the large well) and assemble the gel to the electrophoresis tank. Perform the 2D-electrophoresis as described for 1D-BN-PAGE.2D-BN-PAGE Place the gel strip in a culture tube (5 ml) and add 2 ml of detergent buffer B (1% β-DM).Solubilize the strip for 40 min at 4 °C in gentle rocking to allow even solubilization of the strip (e.g., 20 rpm).Place the strip on the second BN-PA gel (see sketch in Figure 3) and assemble the gel to the electrophoresis tank. Perform the electrophoresis as described for the 1D-BN-PAGE.Scan the gel after the electrophoresis whit a photo scanner (see sketch of the 2D-BN-PAGE in Figure 4, the flowchart demonstrating the follow-up paths in Figure 5 and scanned image of the representative gel in Figure 6B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180628/20180628223136_7881.jpgFigure 4. 2D-BN-PAGE separation of thylakoid protein complexes. Protein complexes B1-B9 (green bands on the upper horizontal gel slice) were first separated according to their mass and shape on 1D-BN-PAGE.",
    "After separation the gel slice was subjected to 2D-BN-PAGE during which the complexes (B1-B9) are fractionated into subcomplexes (narrow green bands on the 2D-BN-gel). The complexes on the diagonal (dashed line) represent complexes that have preserved their mass, whereas the complexes below the diagonal are subcomplexes (of B1-B9) that have been disconnected during second solubilization and 2D-BN-PAGE.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180628/20180628223223_4805.jpgFigure 5. Flowchart of the experimental procedureWestern blotting of 2D-native gelsPlace the 2D-BN-PA-gel to transfer buffer and incubate for 30 min.Activate the PVDF membrane with 100% methanol and place the membrane to transfer buffer. Soak six Whatman filter papers in the transfer buffer. Assemble three papers on the electrode (anode). Place the membrane on top of the papers and the gel on top of the membrane. Finally, place the three papers on top of the gel and mount the cathode on top. Set the current for 1 mA/cm2 gel area, and transfer for at least 1 h.Destain the membrane with 100% methanol.Block the membrane with 5% BSA for 1 h.Perform immunostaining with specific antibodies (see representative blots from Figure 6C).Lhcb1, Lhcb2, Lhcb3P-Lhcb1 and P-Lhcb23D-SDS-PAGECut the lanes containing the subcomplexes (corresponding to complexes B1-B9). Protein solubilization and separation on SDS-PAGE are as described for the 2D-SDS-PAGE analysis in Järvi et al., 2011.After electrophoresis, visualize the protein with Sypro Ruby Stain or with silver staining according to Blum et al., 1987 (see representative 3D gels from Figure 6D, the nine gels correspond to complexes B1-B9)."
