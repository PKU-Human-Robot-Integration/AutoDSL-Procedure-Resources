    "All applicable international, national, and institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed. Aseptic surgery techniques were applied to the stereotaxic virus vector injection.\n1. Stereotaxic virus vector injection\nNOTE: Virus carrying the genetic material for expressing GCaMP6s (AAV9.CAG.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40) is stereotaxically injected as previously described7,8 with following modifications.\nUse quartz glass (external diameter: 1.14 mm, internal diameter: 0.53 mm) instead of borosilicate glass to fabricate a pipette with long and rigid taper for IO injection using a laser capillary puller with parameters adjusted as in the product manual. After pulling, cut off 1-2 mm from the tip of the pipette with a scalpel to acquire an 8-10 mm long taper with a 15-20 µm internal tip diameter (Figure 1a). Finalize the pipette by beveling its tip to a 30° needle shape with a rotating micropipette beveler for easier brain penetration and less pipette bending (Figure 1a).\n\tNOTE: The commonly used borosilicate glass pipette will be too flexible to correctly target deep areas when pulled to this length. A nanoliter injector was used with the glass pipette to deliver the virus in this study. Alternatively, a precision glass syringe or a pressure injector can also be used.\nMake sure the mouse chest lies on the thermal pad so its neck is not stretched with enough body support, and be extremely careful with leveling the skull when fixing the mouse on the stereotaxic frame (Figure 1b).\n\tNOTE: Bregma-lambda difference should be less than 0.05 mm in vertical dimension.\nUse 6.2 mm caudal, ±0.5 mm lateral and 6.6 mm ventral relative to bregma as the the coordinates for targeting the principal IO nucleus (Figure 1c).",
    "NOTE: Perfect leveling of brain will dramatically increase the success rate of injecting virus into IO. The coordinates must be confirmed by the experimenter as significant differences are expected between laboratories, mouse strains and individual researchers. For preparing video material for this publication, we used one male C57Bl/6J mouse.\nFollow the relevant institutional guidelines for post-operative care and housing procedures for viral-transfected animals for 3-4 weeks.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62222/62222fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Stereotaxic virus vector injection. (a) The laser-pulled quartz glass pipette has a 10-12 mm long straight taper. After pulling, cut off 1-2 mm from the tip. The pipette is finalized by beveling the tip to a 30° needle shape. (b) The correct injection relies on the proper position of mouse body in the stereotaxic frame. Support the mouse chest to prevent stretching the neck. Level the mouse head by aligning the bregma and lambda horizontally. (c) The IO coordination relative to bregma is shown in dorsal view (left) of the mouse skull and coronal view (right top) of the brain. Injection reaches the lateral part of the principal (IOPr) and the dorsal (IOD) subnuclei of IO (right bottom).

Preparation of tools and consumables for ventral approach surgery\nPrepare an intubation tube by cutting a 5 to 6 mm long and 0.8 mm wide slit from the tip of a 20-gauge catheter so the intubated animal can breathe out (Figure 2a).\n\tNOTE: The slit is needed for animal to breath out if a common isoflurane vaporizer with constant airflow is utilized. If a ventilator is used in addition to the vaporizer, the catheter can be left intact.",
    "Prepare a blunt needle to support the trachea during the tracheotomy. Cut off the sharp tip of a 25-gauge needle with pliers. Smooth the fracture surface with sandpaper. Bend the blunt needle in the middle to about 15° with pliers.\n\tNOTE: A curved needle lifts the trachea gently. This can decrease the deformation of the trachea.\nDilute 50 mg/mL ketamine with saline to 15%. The final concentration is 7.5 mg/mL.\nAssemble the clean surgery tools and the consumables including lidocaine gel, saline, gelatin sponges, absorbent swabs, petroleum jelly and cleaning tissue.\nSwitch on the isoflurane vaporizer. Set the animal heating pad to 38 °C.\nTurn the nose cone of stereotaxic frame 180° horizontally, so the mouse can be fixed into the frame ventral side up. Adjust the nose cone height so that it is at the level of ear bars.\n3. Administration of anesthesia and preparation of the mouse for the surgery\nWeigh the animal with a weighing scale and calculate the amount of diluted ketamine for injection.\n\tNOTE: The total amount of ketamine needed is 56.25 mg per kg body weight. Therefore, the volume of diluted ketamine is 7.5 mL per kg body weight. The drawbacks of using ketamine alone include poor muscle relaxation, tachycardia and enhanced muscle tone9. In this protocol, though, ketamine is only used to cover the 10-20 s period during which isoflurane administration is interrupted due to the tracheotomy. By keeping this step as brief as possible, the anesthetic effect of isoflurane is not significantly diminished and the drawbacks using ketamine are minimized.",
    "Place the mouse into the anesthetic induction chamber prefilled with 5% isoflurane. When the animal is fully anesthetized shown by loss of righting reflex and deeper and slower breathing pattern, switch the isoflurane flow to the nose cone of stereotaxic frame and reduce the isoflurane concentration to 2.5%.\nFix the animal in the stereotaxic frame ventral side up (Figure 2b). Adjust the elevation and the pitch of the nose cone to make sure the animal can breathe easily. Keep the animal warm with the pre-warmed heating pad.\n\tNOTE: Covering the lower part of the animal body with a piece of tissue paper or aluminum foil can help maintaining the animal temperature.\nRemove the skin hair in throat and thigh areas with a shaver and hair removal cream (Figure 2b). Topically apply the lidocaine gel on the throat skin.\n\t​NOTE: The thigh clamp peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) sensor, which will be used in procedure 6, works best on hairless skin.\nMonitor the animal temperature with a rectal thermometer (Figure 2b).\nInject 1 mL of warm (37 °C) saline intraperitoneally to compensate for the fluid loss during surgery.\nAssess the depth of anesthesia by strong pinch on hind limb toes. No detectable response should be evoked.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62222/62222fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Preparation of ventral approach surgery. (a) Prepare an intubation tube by cutting a 5-6 mm long and 0.8 mm wide slit in the tip of 20-gauge catheter. (b) Mount the animal ventral side up in a stereotaxic frame and adjust the nose cone angle to ensure the animal is breathing easily. Shave the skin around the throat and thigh areas. Attach the SpO2 sensor to the thigh for monitoring mouse vital signs. Insert the rectal temperature probe for monitoring mouse body temperature.

    "4. Tracheotomy and intubation (20-25 min)\nExposing the trachea.\n\t\nMake a vertical incision in throat skin along the midline. Separate the neck skin from the viscera under it by using the blunt dissection method and cut the skin off to reveal the salivary glands (Figure 3a-b, 4a).\nFree salivary glands from the connective tissue and flip them laterally to expose the sternothyroid muscle covered trachea with forceps (Figure 3b-c).\n\t\tNOTE: The petroleum jelly can be applied on the exposed tissue to keep them moist. Avoid the trachea area to keep it clean for the following steps.\nTracheotomy\n\t\nInject the first dose of diluted ketamine (7.5 mg/mL) intraperitoneally, 5 mL per kg body weight (37.5 mg/kg).\n\t\tNOTE: It takes 3-5 min for ketamine to function, thus the first dose of ketamine should be injected before separating the trachea from surrounding muscles and blood vessels. Ketamine is administered in two injections because of the elevated risk of overdose effects when combined with isoflurane anesthesia.\nCarefully split the sternothyroid muscle along the midline with the tip of a fine forceps to expose the trachea (Figure 3c). Detach the trachea from the blood vessels and the esophagus with forceps using the blunt dissection method.\nIntraperitoneally inject the second dose of diluted ketamine (7.5 mg/mL), 2.5 mL per kg body weight (18.75 mg/kg).\nInsert a blunt needle under the trachea crosswise to prop it up (Figure 3d). Hold this needle with fingers to support the trachea. Guide the suture thread around the third trachea ring caudal to the thyroid gland with a half-circle needle (Figure 3d). Make four instrument ties on this tracheal ring.",
    "NOTE: The thread tied to the tracheal ring is used to secure the trachea to the animal chest. Do not cut the thread off from the half circle needle at this step. Tracheal rings are made of cartilage which is flexible but less strong than bones. Do not tie the suture thread too tight or the ring may break.\nPinch the chest skin with a pair of forceps. Pierce the chest skin with the same half-circle needle used in the last step and lead the thread through the skin, in preparation for securing the trachea to the chest in the next step (Figure 3d).\nGently lift the trachea by pulling the thread tied to the tracheal ring and cut the trachea rostral to the tied ring and caudal to the thyroid glands. Pull the caudal trachea towards the chest. Raise the opening of the trachea by adding a small piece of surgical sponge under it.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure more than 5 min have passed after the second injection of ketamine before cutting the trachea to ensure the anesthesia level.\nRemove any remaining liquid inside the opening tip of the trachea with a thin strip of cleaning tissue. Switch the isoflurane flow from stereotaxic nose cone to the intubation tube. Insert the intubation tube into the trachea about 2 mm deep and make sure part of the slit in the tube remains outside of the trachea to allow breathing (Figure 3e, 4b).\n\t\t​NOTE: Carefully adjust the angle of the intubation tube and its insertion depth to make the mouse breath smoothly and to avoid damaging the trachea. Petroleum jelly can be applied on the outside of trachea to prevent it from getting dry, so the trachea does not rupture easily.",
    "Fix the trachea to the chest skin by making 3-4 instrumental ties. Tie the trachea with the suture thread to secure the intubation tube (Figure 3e, 4b).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62222/62222fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Tracheotomy and intubation of mouse.

Exposing the brainstem (40-45 min)\nSlit the sternothyroid muscle along the muscle fiber with the fine forceps. Cut the isolated part off with the spring scissors (Figure 3e).\nCarefully free the left-over trachea and the larynx from muscles to minimize the damage on the blood vessels in muscles. Remove the left-over trachea and the larynx. Free the esophagus from the attached tissue with forceps and cut it off with spring scissors. (Figure 5a).\nRemove the muscle covering the ventral arch and the anterior tubercle of atlas with fine forceps and spring scissors (Figure 5b).\n\tNOTE: When removing the muscle, split part of it with the tip of the fine forceps. Cut the separated part off with a pair of spring scissors. Repeat this multiple times to expose the atlas ventral arch to minimize the risk of ripping blood vessels.",
    "Cut the ventral arches of atlas with a rongeur (Figure 4c, 5c). Remove the anterior tubercle of atlas. Remove the blood and fluid with surgical sponge to view the foramen magnum and the brain stem (Figure 4c, 5d).\nExpand the foramen magnum by removing the occipital bone with a rongeur. (Figure 5d-e).\nRemove the thin cartilage above the foramen magnum with fine forceps and spring scissors. Carefully peel the periosteal layer of the dura mater with fine forceps to have a clear view of the ventral brainstem (Figure 5f).

Calcium imaging\nClamp the SpO2 sensor on the thigh of the mouse to monitor vital signs such as heart rate, oxygen saturation and breath rate (Figure 2b).",
    "NOTE: The heart rate should be between 500 bpm and 600 bpm, the oxygen saturation should be higher than 90%, and the breath rate should be 50-70 breaths per minute10,11.\nMount the GRIN lens probe (9mm length. 1 mm diameter) on the implantation rod.\n\tNOTE: Clean the GRIN lens with 70% ethanol-soaked cleaning tissue before imaging for good imaging quality.\nFix the implantation rod on the stereotaxic frame and mount the miniature microscope on the implantation rod.\n\tNOTE: Preparation of the miniature microscope for imaging should be completed according to appropriate product user guidelines.\nAdd several drops of warm saline in the brainstem area for immersion of the GRIN lens.\nApproach the brainstem with the GRIN lens (Figure 4d, 5g). Turn on the excitation blue LED (455 ± 8) in the miniature microscope. Locate the GCaMP6s-transfected IO neurons by monitoring the fluorescence image from the miniature microscope. Look for IO neurons in a rectangle-shaped region ~0.5-1.7 mm rostral to the remaining atlas and ~0.6-1.1 mm lateral to the midline in the superficial area of ventral brainstem (Figure 5f).\n\tNOTE: When looking for an appropriate field of view for IO imaging, look for the location where the average diameter of somata matches that of IO neuron somata (about 15 µm12). The adjacent regions in medullary reticular formation consist of significantly larger cells13,14. Be careful when moving GRIN lens vertically, as pressing it on brainstem too hard may kill animal.\n7. Euthanizing animal following procedure\nAt the end of experiment, euthanize the animal with cervical dislocation or other method approved by local laboratory animal care regulation.\nFor further histology investigation, first anesthetize the animal with injectable drug, such as ketamine/xylazine combination (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively)15 before heart perfusion with Ringer's solution followed by fixative solution to fix the brain.",
    "8. Data processing\nPre-process the recorded calcium imaging video before analyzing data.\n\tNOTE: The commercial data processing software accompanied with the miniature microscope was used for this step and the following protocol steps relate to that. Alternatively, free and open source software such as CaImAn16, MINIPIPE17, and MiniscoPy18 can be utilized for both pre-processing and analysis.\n\t\nLoad the recorded calcium imaging video in the data processing software.\nClick the Preprocess button. Define a crop area excluding regions without any fluorescent neurons and crop the video to decrease the file size for faster processing.\nClick the Spatial Filter button. Set the low cut-off and the high cut-off for spatial filter to 0.005 pixel-1, and 0.5 pixel-1 respectively. Apply the spatial filter on each frame of the video to increase the contrast and smooth the image.\n\t\tNOTE: The spatial filter is a bandpass Gaussian filter. Low spatial frequency components originating in out-of-focus cells may confound motion correction in next step. High spatial frequency component may cause the video to appear less smooth.\nClick the Motion Correction button. Apply the motion correction to the video by using the first frame as the reference frame to reduce the movement-related artefacts caused by blood flow in the brainstem.\n\t\tNOTE: The motion correction uses an image registration method developed by Thevenaz et al19.\nExport the motion-corrected video as TIFF format.\nApply CNMF-E20 on the motion-corrected video in MATLAB to identify single neurons, following the instructions for the CNMF-E MATLAB code in the online repository21.\n\tNOTE: CNMF-E is a constrained non-negative matrix factorization approach customized for one-photon imaging. Demo scripts in the repository can be modified and used to process data."
