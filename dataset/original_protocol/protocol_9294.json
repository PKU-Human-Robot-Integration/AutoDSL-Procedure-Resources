    "1.  Construction of the electroporation chamber\nOrder a microslide, BTX Model 453 with a 3.2mm gap (Harvard Apparatus #45-0105) (Fig. 2A).  The metal rails should be completely sealed to the bottom of the slide.\nUse a Dremel tool to cut a handle off a plastic microcentrifuge tube rack.  Cut the handle into 5 small rectangular pieces each with the following dimensions:  length 0.8cm, height 0.6cm, width 0.3cm (Fig. 2B).  These plastic pieces are reusable spacers that will be used to mold individual wells in the microslide chamber.\nInsert the plastic spacers between the metal rails of the microslide at even intervals.  The spacers should fit snugly (Fig. 2C).\nCut the tip off a P200 pipette tip, fit the tip to a 3ml syringe, and fill the syringe with 100% silicone rubber aquarium sealant.  Fill the gaps between the plastic spacers with sealant.  Be sure to fill the gaps from the bottom up so that no bubbles form between the sealant plug and the base of the microslide.\nPlace a metal rod atop the plastic spacers and fasten it with binder clips, so that the spacers are held in place while the sealant dries (Fig. 2D-E).  Let the sealant dry overnight.\nRemove the binder clips, metal rod, and plastic spacers (Fig. 2F).  Use a scalpel blade to clean the sealant off the top of the metal rails.  Use a dissecting microscope to examine the microslide and ensure that no bubbles are present at the bottom of the silicone dams.  Remove any sealant film that may have formed in the wells such that bare metal is exposed inside the wells.  Fill one well with water and make sure that the water doesn’t leak into the adjacent well(s).  Repeat for all wells.",
    "The finished microslide fits in the plastic dish with the metal poles adjacent to the window in the side of the dish (Fig. 2G); the electrodes will eventually be attached to the metal poles.\n2.  DNA preparation\nAdd plasmid DNA to a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube on ice and bring the volume up to 150μl with distilled water.  Multiple plasmid species may be combined for co-electroporation (e.g., an experimental DsRed construct and a control GFP construct).  When calculating the amount of DNA to add to the tube, keep in mind that the final volume of the DNA aliquot will be 60μl.  Typically, each construct is used at a final concentration of 0.5μg/μl.\nPrecipitate the DNA by adding 15μl 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 450μl 100% ethanol.  Invert or tap the tube several times to mix.\nSpin down the DNA at 4°C, 13,200 rpm, for 30 minutes.  Wash the pellet with 70% ethanol, then spin it down again at 4°C, 13,200 rpm, for 15 minutes.  Air-dry the pellet until semi-translucent, about 7 minutes, then resuspend in 54μl sterile water.  Add 6μl sterile 10X PBS (pH 7.4) and mix.\n3.  Eye collection\nSterilize the electroporation chamber and all instruments with 70% ethanol.  While eye collection and dissection need not be performed in a tissue culture hood, disinfect your gloves and benchtop with ethanol and attempt to maintain sterile conditions throughout the procedure.\nPrepare Petri dishes with dissection medium (1:1 ratio of DMEM:F12, 100U/ml penicillin, 100μg/ml streptomycin, 0.29mg/ml L-glutamine, and 5μg/ml insulin):  two 35mm dishes each with 3ml medium and one 60mm dish with 6ml medium.  This step should be performed in a tissue culture hood.",
    "Disinfect the head and neck of a newborn (postnatal day 0) mouse pup with 70% ethanol.  Quickly decapitate with scissors and transfer the head to a sterile 100mm dish.\nCut away the scalp with small scissors to expose the eyes.  Use curved forceps to gently scoop the eye out of the orbit, and place the eye in a 35mm dish containing dissection medium.  It may be helpful to remove the eyes under a dissecting microscope at low power.\nRepeat steps 3.3 and 3.4 until all eyes have been collected.  Keep eyes in dissection medium at room temperature while dissecting.  You will need 3-4 eyes per DNA aliquot.\n4.  Retinal dissection\nUse 70% ethanol to disinfect both a razor blade and the wrapper of a sterile plastic transfer pipette.  Cut the tip off the pipette with the blade so that it can suck up a whole eye.  Store the pipette in the plastic wrapper when not in use.\nTransfer one eye from the 35mm dish to the 60mm dish.  Under the dissecting microscope at high power, use fine forceps to remove any tissue, such as extraocular muscles and fat, from the surface of the eye.  Then, remove the optic nerve by pinching it off at the base.\nIn order to isolate the retina, poke a small hole in the sclera at the limbus.  Insert one prong from both pairs of forceps into the hole (tangential to the retinal surface) and gently tear open the sclera/RPE.  In albino mice, the sclera and RPE appear shiny relative to the retinal tissue, which is a homogeneous matte gray color.  In pigmented mice, the RPE is black.  Leave the lens in place.\nUse the transfer pipette to move the dissected retina into the other 35mm dish with medium.",
    "Repeat steps 4.2 to 4.4 until all eyes have been dissected.\nStore the retinas in a 37°C tissue culture incubator until you are ready to electroporate.\n5.  Preparation for electroporation\nPrepare 35mm dishes of medium.  For each DNA aliquot to be electroporated, you will need one dish of dissection medium and one dish of culture medium (dissection medium plus 10% FBS).  Label the dishes appropriately.\nUse a P200 pipette and sterile 1X PBS to wash out the chambers in the electroporation dish.  Each chamber holds a volume of 60-100μl.  Wash out each chamber three times.\nFill the chambers with the DNA aliquots.  Any unused chambers should be filled with 60μl 1X PBS.  Connect the electrodes to the electroporation dish.\nUse the following settings on the electroporator:  mode, LV; voltage, 30V; pulse length, 50 msec; number of pulses, 5; interval, 950 msec; polarity, unipolar.\n6.  Electroporation\nUse fine forceps to grasp the retinas by the lens and transfer them into the electroporation chambers.  Each chamber holds up to 3-4 mouse retinas (Fig. 3).\nUse forceps to line up the retinas such that the lens leans against the metal bar attached to the positive electrode.  Clean the forceps with a Kimwipe after each transfer to avoid carry-over of DNA from one chamber to the next.\nOnce all retinas are aligned, press “Start” on the electroporator.  Tiny bubbles should form on the metal bar attached to the negative electrode.\nDisconnect the electrodes and turn off the electroporator.\nUse forceps to gently move the retinas away from the chamber walls.\nUse a sterile transfer pipette to transfer the retinas from the chambers into the 35mm dishes containing dissection medium.\nWash out each chamber three times with sterile 1X PBS, then rinse with sterile water.  Spray dish with 70% ethanol.",
    "7.  Placing retinas on filters for culture\nUse a transfer pipette to transfer the retinas into the 35mm dishes containing culture medium.\nLabel the wells of a sterile 6-well culture plate and fill each well with 3ml culture medium.\nUse sterile forceps to place round Whatman Nuclepore filters, shiny side up, atop the medium in each well.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, use a sterile transfer pipette to transfer the retinas onto the filter, lens-side-down.  If the retina lands lens-side-up, pick it up with the pipette and attempt to place it again.  Do not place more than 4 retinas on one filter, and make sure that the droplets of medium surrounding each retina remain separate from the other droplets.  Note that we culture the retina with the lens intact, although other protocols call for the removal of the lens prior to this step9.\nPlace the culture plate in a 37°C tissue culture incubator (5% CO2) and grow for the desired amount of time, typically eight days.  In our experience, changing the medium is unnecessary during the eight day culture period, although a medium change may be required for longer culture periods.\n8.  Harvesting and flatmounting fluorescent retinal explants\nReplace the culture medium in each well with 4% paraformaldehyde / 1X PBS.  If the retinas remain stuck to the filters, use forceps to flip the filters over and gently peel the retinas off the filter.  Incubate in paraformaldehyde for 30 min. at room temperature.  Protect the retinas from light to avoid bleaching the fluorescence.\nRinse the retinas twice for 10 minutes in 1X PBS.\nUse a disposable pipette to transfer the retinas onto a glass slide in a small drop of PBS.  Under a fluorescent dissecting microscope, use forceps to flip the retinas so that they are electroporated-side-up (i.e., lens-side-down).",
    "Place glass “feet” made from crushed coverslips (glass shards about 1-2 mm in diameter) at the corners of the slide; these feet prevent flattening of the retina.  Place an intact glass coverslip over the slide so that it covers the retinas and rests on the feet.  If necessary, use a pipette to add more PBS between the slide and the coverslip.\n9.  Imaging and quantification of fluorescence in flatmount\nUse a fluorescent compound microscope equipped with a monochrome camera to image the flatmounted retina at low power (4X objective) in the red and green channels.  All retinas must be imaged with the same exposure time for a given fluorescent channel to enable comparison of fluorescence intensities.  Make sure that the pixels are not saturated in any image, or else accurate quantification will be impossible.  Export images in grayscale TIFF format.\nOpen the image set for one retina (i.e.., red channel and green channel) in ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/[href=http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/]).  For the sake of this tutorial, the green fluorescent channel (GFP protein) is the control construct that is constant across all retinas in the experiment.  The red fluorescent channel (DsRed protein) is the experimental construct that varies for each set of retinas.  The images should be in grayscale.",
    "In ImageJ, select the control green image and specify a circle of interest with diameter 100 units (Analyze/Tools/ROI manager/More/Specify).  Duplicate this circle (ROI manager/Add) to create eight circles total.  Move circles 1-5 to select five regions that are uniformly electroporated, avoiding the outer edges of the retina and the region overlying the lens (Fig. 4A).  Also, select three regions (circles 6-8) outside the retina/lens to measure background fluorescence.  Select the red image, un-check the “Show all” box in ROI manager, and re-check the box.  All eight circles should appear on the red image.  De-select all circle coordinates in ROI manager.\nWith the red image selected, record the mean pixel value for all circles of interest (ROI manager/Measure); measurements 1-8 should appear, where 1-5 are the red retinal measurements and 6-8 are the red background measurements.  Select the green image and record the mean pixel value; measurements 9-16 should appear, where 9-13 are the green retinal measurements and 14-16 are the green background measurements.  Copy the measurement data into Excel for analysis (Fig. 5).\nAverage the three background measurements in both the red and the green channels.  Subtract the red background average from each of the five retinal measurements in the red channel; repeat for the green channel.  For each retinal region-of-interest, divide the background-subtracted red measurement by the background-subtracted green measurement in order to normalize the experimental red level to the control green level (Fig. 5).",
    "Determine the average and standard deviation of all normalized measurements for a given DsRed construct (e.g., 5 measurements per retina times 3 separate retinas).  In order to quantitatively compare the results of electroporations carried out on different days, always include a “standard” DsRed/GFP precipitation in each electroporation set.  Relative expression values across experiments can be compared by normalizing to the expression level of this “standard.”\n10. Representative Results:\nA good electroporation results in expression of the DNA construct(s) across 1/4 to 1/3 of the retinal surface (Fig. 4A). Since rod photoreceptors in particular are efficiently transduced, this technique is ideal for quantifying photoreceptor-specific promoter activity (Fig. 4B). We previously used this approach to quantify a range of promoter variants from the rod-specific Rho and Gnat1 loci10.  We found that it is possible to quantify promoter activity over a nearly 300-fold range. \nFigure 5 is a sample dataset from a single electroporated retina.  In this particular example, the experimental construct pNrl(1.1kb)-DsRed was measured in the red channel and the control construct pNrl(3.2kb)-GFP was measured in the green channel.  A complete dataset for the pNrl(1.1kb)-DsRed construct would consist of 6-9 retinas measured in this manner, and standard deviation would be calculated based on all “DsRed normalized to GFP” values.  If we were comparing the expression level of pNrl(1.1kb)-DsRed to, for example, pNrl(0.8kb)-DsRed, then both constructs would need to be electroporated with the same GFP control (e.g., pNrl(3.2kb)-GFP) and imaged at the same exposure times.  It is possible to pool data collected on different days if a standard DsRed/GFP electroporation is performed on each day (e.g., pNrl(3.2kb)-dsRed + pNrl(3.2kb)-GFP).  For each experimental construct, the normalized DsRed level would subsequently be normalized to the normalized DsRed level of the “standard” (pNrl(3.2kb)-dsRed).",
    "The technique we describe here is primarily useful for quantifying the activity of photoreceptor CREs10,13.  Cell-type specific cis-regulatory activity can also be quantified in rarer retinal cell types such as bipolar cells14, but this usually requires that the areas of interest to be quantified be selected in vertical cross-sections rather than in flatmount preparations. The same is true of CREs which drive expression in multiple cell types such as photoreceptors and bipolar cells. The experimental procedures are otherwise similar.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2821/2821fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of the retinal explant electroporation procedure.  First, whole eyes are isolated from postnatal day 0 mouse pups and the retinas are dissected (P1).  Second, the retinas are placed in chambers filled with DNA and electroporated (P2).  Third, the retinas are placed on filters and cultured for eight days (P3).  Fourth, the retinal explants are fixed, mounted on slides, and imaged.  Fluorescence intensity is measured with ImageJ software (P4).  Fifth, the ImageJ data are processed in a spreadsheet program to quantify the difference in activity of various promoters (P5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2821/2821fig2.jpg",

Retinas are placed in the chambers and oriented so that the lens is leaning against the metal bar connected to the positive electrode; three or four retinas will fit in each of the five chambers.  The electrical current will cause the negatively-charged DNA molecules to move into the retinal cells.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2821/2821fig4.jpg",

Grayscale flatmount images in the DsRed (experimental) and GFP (control) channels are opened in ImageJ software; note that these images have been colored for illustrative purposes only.
