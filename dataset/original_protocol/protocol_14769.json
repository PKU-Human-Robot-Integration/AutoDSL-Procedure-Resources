    "Ethical statement: Summa Health System institutional review board approval was obtained for this study.\n1. Treatment Consultation\nDescribe the new lung SBRT treatment to the patient.\n\tNOTE: The new SBRT platform delivers coplanar and non-coplanar high radiation dose to cancer targets while lowering radiation dose to non-target organs.\nDiscuss the treatment risks.\n\tNOTE: SBRT may result in possible short-term skin hyperpigmentation or erythema, tiredness, infrequent cough, nausea, esophagitis, and rare visceral organ injury. Pneumonitis, or inflammation of the lung with low-grade fever and non-productive cough, may occur up to three months after treatment. Acute or late injuries to the heart, other muscles, peripheral nerves or spinal cord, and bone are uncommon. There is a very small hazard for radiation-induced malignancy.\n2. Fiducial Marker Placement\nPerform percutaneous CT-guided or bronchoscopic placement of a single gold-coated marker inserted into the tumor target center-of-mass.\n\t\nAsk a radiologist to perform a 3-5 mm thick contiguous axial tomographic imaging of the patient’s chest7.\nDetermine a safe needle approach minimizing aerated lung tissue traversed (avoiding bullae and fissures)7.\nInject local subcutaneous anesthesia (e.g., 1% lidocaine).\nIntroduce 17 or 18 G coaxial needle to place a single short (0.75 x 10 mm) or single long (0.75 x 20 mm) marker10.\nDo an electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy-guided fiducial marker placement by asking a pulmonologist to acquire tomographic imaging of the chest for endobronchial mapping21.\n\t\nWedge the bronchoscope in the suspected bronchial segment.\nSteer the bronchoscope sensor probe to the target lesion.\nDeploy a fiducial marker by transbronchial needle.\n\t\tNOTE: Techniques for fiducial-free radiosurgery in the lung are considered investigational and subject to active research22,23.",
    "As an alternative, order at least three short (1.6 x 3 mm) gold-coated markers to be positioned within a 6 cm ‘box’ around the target. If more than one fiducial marker is placed, a physical separation of 2 cm between markers is recommended.\n3. Treatment Planning\nPerform CT-guided simulation (described in steps 3.2 and 3.3) 4-7 days after fiducial marker placement.\nAsk the patient to lie in a supine-head-first on the treatment machine flat tabletop.\n\t\nPosition the patient’s arms over their head, supported by upper arm and wrist holders or a vacuum-bag immobilizer. Ensure that the thorax and abdomen are not immobilized.\nOptionally, use a two-pin localized knee sponge for indexing.\nPlace at least 4 infrared-tracked body markers on the chest for localization. Infrared-tracked breathing markers overly body regions demonstrating consistent vertical respiratory motion (3 mm or more peak-to-peak motion is recommended).\nConduct a non-contrasted contiguous helical axial CT scan (1 mm slice thickness, voltage 120 kVp, 350 mAs).\n\tNOTE: Treating physicians may order a 4D CT thorax scan12 or a 3D CT thorax scan that includes free-breathing, end-inspiration, and end-expiration breath-hold image sets24.\nObtain 18F-FDG PET/CT scans for enhanced capture of lung tumor motion.\n\t\nAsk the patients to lie in a head-first scanning position for contiguous helical CT scan (e.g., voltage 120 kVp, 450 mAs) from the orbitomeatal line to upper thighs during quiet breathing.\nAcquire 18F-FDG PET after intravenous administration of 11 mCi of 18F-FDG on average in the same scanning position from the orbitomeatal line to upper thighs during quiet breathing. If this technique is used, 18F-FDG PET/CT scans are auto-contoured by software set at a 40% SUVmax threshold, and then, co-registered with CT simulation images as described1.",
    "Contour the primary lung gross target volume or volumes (GTVp) by hand drawing on 4D CT datasets, preferably the exhale phase. Expanding the GTVp with a 5 mm margin creates the planning tumor volume (PTV). Radiation dose planning occurs on the end-expiration phase scan for dynamic tracking.\n\tNOTE: As an alternative and when using 3D CT datasets, the free-breathing CT simulation scan is the reference scan. Using this technique, the treating radiation oncologist contours the GTV on the free-breathing (GTVfb), inspiration (GTVi), and expiration (GTVe) CT simulation scans. A thresholded 40 percent maximum standard uptake value contour on the 18F-FDG PET images creates an 18F-FDG PET clinical target volume (CTVpet)1. A composite ITV represents the added sum of the GTVfb, GTVi, GTVe, and CTVpet volumes. A 5 mm margin expansion of the composite ITV creates a PTV. Here, radiation dose planning occurs on the free-breathing scan for dynamic tracking.\nContour nearby normal tissue structures by hand drawing on 4D CT datasets, preferably the exhale phase. This may include normal lung, heart plus pericardium, esophagus, liver, bilateral kidneys, brachial plexus, and spinal cord. A contour of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and left mainstem bronchus may be generated, expanded 3 mm, and used as a high-priority planning constraint to avoid late toxicity airway fibrosis.\nClick on the dynamic tracking button in the planning software. This action engages the gimbaled pan-and-tilt tracking on the new SBRT platform.",
    "Prescribe a radiation dose to the PTV. Consider one of three radiation Monte Carlo dose prescriptions: 3 x 17 Gy = 51 Gy daily for peripheral lung lesions; 4 x 12 Gy = 48 Gy for central lung lesions and peripheral chest wall lesions; or every other day 5 x 10 Gy = 50 Gy. Uncommonly when PTV volume constraints (i.e., 95% coverage) or organ-at-risk constraints are not met, a prescription of 8 x 7.5 Gy = 60 Gy may be used.\n4. Treatment Delivery and Workflow\nBuild a quiet breathing correlation model after supine-head-first alignment.\n\t\nPlace 4 (or up to 6) infrared body markers on the body in the same marked locations identified at CT simulation.\nVerify positional accuracy of the body markers and patient alignment by infrared camera and screens at the treatment console.\n\t\tNOTE: Body marker position serves as a beam-on check for irregular movement, such a cough.\nAcquire cross-plane dual-diagnostic kV x-rays or cone-beam CT images at the treatment console to detect implanted markers for internal positional accuracy.\nAssociate and correlate body marker motion (as a surrogate for respiration) and internal implanted marker motion with computer software linked to the new SBRT platform workflow.\n\t\tNOTE: An alternative localization method involves orthogonal alignment of the patient according to anterior and lateral tattooed CT simulation laser triangulation marks and use of a standardized reference array (star) with six impregnated infrared body markers.\nGenerate a lung tumor motion correlation model.\n\t\nDerive a gimbal pan-and-tilt path for the accelerator to track tumor motion using computer software linked to the new SBRT platform workflow.\nVisually assess the lung tumor motion correlation model prior to radiation delivery.\nObserve for fiducial marker drift during radiation delivery.\nEvaluate machine-patient collisions due to gantry rotation, O-ring pivot, and gimbal pan-and-tilt actions prior to plan delivery.",
    "NOTE: The radiation staff will perform this step. Treatment may entail five to nine static coplanar and noncoplanar treatment beams, manually and visually checked by radiation delivery staff. Treatments may last 15-30 min, with lung tumor motion correlation model verifications done approximately every 7 min."
