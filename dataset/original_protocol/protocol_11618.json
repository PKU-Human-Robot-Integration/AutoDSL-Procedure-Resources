    "1. Chicken skin explant culture (Figure 1)\nIncubate fertilized chicken eggs in a humidified incubator at 38 °C and stage them according to Hamburger and Hamilton14.\n\t\nAt stage 28 (~E5.5), the limb's second digit and third toe are longer than the others; three digits and four toes are distinct.\nAt stage 29 (~E6), the wing is bent at the elbow; the second digit is distinctly longer than the others.\nAt stage 30 (~E6.5), two dorsal feather bud rows to either side of the spinal cord are visible at the brachial level and three rows are seen at the level of the legs.\nAt stage 31 (~E7), there are ~7 rows of feathers at the jumbo-sacral levels.\nAt stage 32, eleven or more rows of feather buds are present at the level of the legs.\nPlace a stage 28-32 chicken embryo in a 60 mm Petri dish containing Hanks's buffered saline solution (HBSS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\nDissect out the embryo dorsal skin between the lower neck to the tail region. Use scissors to remove the head from the neck. Gently pull the limb buds to position the ventral side of the body downwards with the appendages spreading outwards.\nMake an anterior to posterior incision in the skin along the two flanking sides of the embryo body using watchmaker's forceps or sharp spring scissors. Be sure to stabilize the body with a pair of forceps by pinching the limb buds longitudinally. Gently peel the skin from the neck to the tail region or from the tail to the neck using watchmaker's forceps.\nGently remove the subcutaneous tissues that remain attached to the peeled skin and smooth the edges of the skin with the sharp spring scissors.",
    "Add 2 mL/well of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Penicillin/streptomycin solution (diluted 1:100) to a well in a 6-well dish. Once the medium and antibiotics have been added, place a sterile tissue culture insert inside the well, such that the media is on the exterior of the culture insert.\nTransfer the skin with a spatula to the culture insert with the epidermis face up and the mesenchyme face down on the insert membrane. To ensure the skin lays flat without any creases, pull the skin onto the spatula in HBSS. Slide the skin off the spatula with the liquid to facilitate the transfer of the skin without folding.\nRemove excess HBSS from the culture insert with a 200 µL pipette. Leave a thin layer of HBSS inside the culture insert to keep the explant semi-wet to provide an air-liquid interface.\nIncubate the skin explant cultures at 37 °C using 5% CO2 and 95% air. Change the medium every 2 days.\n\t​NOTE: This procedure has been published4. This culture system can also be used with the skin of other birds such as quail or finch skin explant cultures.\n2. Chicken skin epithelial-mesenchymal recombination (Figure 2)\nIncubate fertilized chicken eggs in a humidified incubator at 38 °C and stage the embryos according to Hamburger and Hamilton14 (section 1.1).\nPrepare 2x calcium-magnesium-free (CMF) saline with 0.25% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer.",
    "Make 10x CMF buffer (NaCl (1.37 M) 80 g, KCl (0.04 M) 3 g, NaH2PO4 (0.004 M) 0.5 g, KH2PO4 (2 M) 0.25 g, NaHCO3 (0.12 M) 10 g, glucose (0.1 M) 20 g in 1,000 mL of distilled water. Adjust pH to 7.3. To make 100 mL of 2x CMF with 0.25% EDTA buffer, the EDTA should be dissolved in 80 mL of distilled water first, then add 20 mL of 10x CMF buffer to make 2x CMF with 0.25% EDTA working solution.\nDissect stage 30-32 chicken embryo dorsal skins in HBSS as described above (section 1.2) and incubate them in 2x CMF saline with 0.25% EDTA on ice for 15-20 min.\nCarefully separate the epithelium and mesenchyme using watchmaker's forceps. Transfer the separated epithelium and mesenchyme to a clean dish containing HBSS.\nRecombine the epithelium with the mesenchyme by first placing the mesenchyme on a Petri dish containing HBSS, then place the epithelium on top of the mesenchyme. Place the epithelium along the same anterior-posterior axis as the mesenchyme or turn the epithelium 90o from the anterior-posterior axis of the mesenchyme to determine which component regulates different aspects of skin morphogenesis.\nTransfer the recombined skins to culture inserts in 6-well culture dishes for growth and remove excess HBSS around the recombined skin.\nPlace 2 mL of DMEM culture medium with 10% FBS in the well outside the insert. Place a thin layer of DMEM inside the insert chamber to keep the explant semi-wet to provide an air-liquid interface.\nIncubate the skin recombinants at 37 °C in a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Change the medium every 2 days. Document phenotypic changes in initial skin phases of skin development using time-lapse photography with a camera mounted on a dissecting microscope.\n\tNOTE: This procedure has been published11.",
    "3. Chicken skin reconstitution (Figure 3)\nIncubate fertilized chicken eggs in a humidified incubator at 38 °C and stage the embryos according to Hamburger and Hamilton14 (section 1.1).\nDissect stage 30-33 chicken embryo dorsal skins in HBSS. Incubate the skins in 2x CMF saline with 0.25% EDTA on ice for 15-20 min as described above (section 2.3).\nCarefully separate the epithelium and mesenchyme using watchmaker's forceps. Transfer the separated epithelium and mesenchyme to HBSS on ice.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to damage the basal layer of the epithelium when separating the epithelium from the mesenchyme.\nCollect the separated mesenchyme in a 15 mL centrifuge tube and incubate with 0.1% collagenase/trypsin solution made in PBS in a 37 °C water bath for 10-15 min.\nDissociate the skin mesenchyme with a Pasteur pipet to make a single-cell suspension. Add DMEM with 10% FBS to stop the digestion.\nPellet and centrifuge the cells at 233 × g for 5 min. Resuspended the cells with culture medium at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: At this step, the mesenchymal cells can also be resuspended in virus-containing medium for 2-3 h on ice for gene transduction.\nPlace a cell culture insert in one well of a 6-well dish. Drop 10 µL of 2 × 107 cells/mL mesenchymal cells on the tissue culture insert. Place 2 ml of DMEM culture medium with 10% FBS in the well outside of the insert. Incubate the plated mesenchymal cells at 37 °C using a 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator for 1 h to allow the cells to settle on the insert membrane.\nTransfer the intact epithelium on top of the plated mesenchymal droplet with the epithelium basal cell layer facing the mesenchymal cells using a 1 mL pipet.",
    "NOTE: When transferring epithelium to the mesenchymal droplet, the mesenchymal cells should not be disturbed.\nFlatten the intact epithelium over the mesenchyme to make the reconstituted skin explant. Leave a thin layer of the medium on the insert to keep the reconstituted skin explant semi-wet to provide an air-liquid interface. Incubate the reconstituted skin explant at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator. Change the medium every 2 days.\n\tNOTE: This procedure has been published13.\nSubscription Required.
