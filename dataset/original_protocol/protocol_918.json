    "PROCEDURE\nMethod for laparotomy and hepatic hilum exposition.  TIMING 5 min\n1. Anesthetize the rat with i.p. ketamine \\(100 mg.kg-1) and xylazine \\(12 mg.kg-1).\n  2. Disinfect the skin with Chlorhexidine-alcohol \\(0.5%) antiseptic solution. \n  3. Make a midline abdominal skin and muscle incision \\(about 5 cm long), to expose the xyphoid process \\(Figure 1a).\n  4. Retract bilaterally the cut \\(laparotomy) wall using two-curved mosquito forceps so that they hold open the peritoneal cavity, thereby exposing the liver.\n  5. While gently pulling down the middle lobe with a saline-moistened cotton tip, use a curved microsurgery scissors to cut the falciform ligament.\n       CRITICAL STEP There is no need to cut it all the way down to the superior vena cava since there is the risk of injuring this vena and the diaphragm. If so, bleeding and/or pneumothorax may occur.\n6. Using a moistened gauze tip, lift the middle  and left lateral lobe and hold them against thorax.\n  7. Gently pull towards the left the duodenum with a saline–moistened cotton tip to visualize the hepatic hilum.\n  8. Retract the duodenum and the small intestine loops towards the left  and cover them with a saline moistened gauze to maintain the hepatic hilum exposed   \\(Figure 1b).\n  9. Place the rat under an operating microscope at x 6-10 magnification.\n  \nMethod for resection of the extrahepatic biliary tract.  TIMING 25 min.\n10.  Free the common bile duct, using two small micro-tweezers with a 45º angle, from the surrounding peritoneum and connective tissue and from hepatic artery and portal vein in the segment located from hepatic hilum and the beginning of the intrapancreatic portion of the bile duct.",
    "11.  Place the 5-0 silk thread around the common bile duct using the microdissection forceps. Ligate it doubly close to the beginning of its intrapancreatic portion and transect between the two ligatures.          This maneuver produces dilation of the extrahepatic biliary tract proximally to the ligature and facilitates the posterior dissection of the common bile duct and its lobular  biliary branches \\(Figure 2a) .\n  12.  Maintain the proximal ligature of the common bile duct with a length of 4-5 cm to provide the later handling of the common bile duct during its dissection upwards without injuring it  \\(Figure 2b).\n        CRITICAL STEP This long end of the proximal common bile duct ligature allows its dissection without  tracting it too much and without injuring the bile duct.\n13.  Dissect upwards, using two small micro-tweezers with a 45º angle, the common bile duct to identify the first lobular biliary branch. \\! CAUTION  Usually the first biliary branch corresponds to the caudate lobe \\(60%), but in the rest of  the cases the first one is the branch corresponding to the right lateral lobe21.\n  14.  Dissect the biliary branch of the caudate lobe and isolate it from the arterial and portal caudate lobular branches using a moistened cotton tip and the small micro-tweezers.\n       ?TROUBLESHOOTING  \n15.  With the help of the microdissection forceps, doubly ligate the lobular biliary branches of the caudate lobe using 6-0 silk sutures. The first ligature must be as close as possible to the parenchyma of the caudate lobe and the second ligature close to the common bile duct.\n  ?TROUBLESHOOTING \n16.  Use the microsurgery curved scissors to transect the biliary lobular branch of the caudate lobe between the two ligatures \\(Figure 3a).",
    "17.  Gently pulling to the left the ligated common bile duct and then, dissect the second biliary branch, belonging to the right lateral lobe, using the  angled micro-tweezers.\n  18.  Identify the arterial and portal right lateral lobular branches and free the biliary branch of the right lateral lobe from them using a moistened cotton tip and the small micro-tweezers.\n       ?TROUBLESHOOTING  \n19. With the help of the microdissection forceps, doubly ligate the lobular biliary branches of the right lateral lobe using 6-0 silk sutures. The first ligature must be as close as possible to the parenchyma of the right lateral lobe and the second ligature close to the common bile duct \\(Figure 3a).\n  ?TROUBLESHOOTING  \n20.  Use the microsurgery curved scissors to cut the biliary lobular branch of the right lateral lobe between the two ligatures.\n  21.  Carefully dissect upwards the biliary tract of the middle and the left lateral lobes with micro-tweezers.  CRITICAL STEP This is the most difficult dissection due to the frequent anatomical variations of the extrahepatic bile duct corresponding to the right middle lobe and the left middle lobe. In this area the vicinity between the biliary tract and the subjacent  hepatic artery branches is very close. Free the biliary tract as gently as you can by using a moistened cotton tip and the micro-tweezers.\n  22.  Pull the ligated common bile duct to the right, holding with a micro-tweezers of the ligature, to tract lobular biliary branch of the left lateral lobe. This maneuver simplifies its dissection and posterior section.  \n  23.  Identify the arterial and portal middle and left lateral lobular branches and free the biliary branch of the left lateral lobe from them by using a moistened cotton tip and the small micro-tweezers.\n       ?TROUBLESHOOTING",
    "24.   With the help of the microdissection forceps, doubly ligate the lobular biliary branches of the left lateral lobe using 6-0 silk sutures. The first ligature must be as close as possible to the parenchyma of the left lateral lobe and the second ligature close to the drainage of the left middle lobe duct into the hilar biliary tract  \\(Figure 3b).\n  ?TROUBLESHOOTING  \n CRITICAL STEP.  Do not section the left lateral lobe biliary branch         before dissecting the left middle lobe biliary branch. \n25.  Carefully dissect the left middle lobe biliary branch, using the angled micro-tweezers and a moistened cotton tip.\n        CRITICAL STEP Avoid injuring the hepatic parenchyma during the dissection of the lobular biliary branch of the left middle lobe. There is a very small space for doing this dissection, so it is very easy to injure the middle lobe parenchyma and cause bleeding.\n26.  Prevent injuring the portal branch of the left middle lobe during the dissection of the corresponding  lobular biliary branch.\n  27.  With the help of the microdissection forceps, doubly ligate the lobular biliary branch of the left middle lobe using 6-0 silk sutures. The first ligature must be as close as possible to the parenchyma of the left middle lobe and the second ligature close to the drainage of the right middle lobe duct into the hilar biliary tract \\(Figure 3b).\n  ?TROUBLESHOOTING  \n28. Carefully dissect the right middle lobe biliary branch, using the angled micro-tweezers and a moistened cotton tip.",
    "29. With the help of the microdissection forceps, doubly ligate the lobular biliary branch of the right middle lobe using 6-0 silk sutures. The first ligature must be as close as possible to the parenchyma of the right middle lobe and the second ligature close to the drainage of the middle lobe duct into the hilar biliary tract.\n      ?TROUBLESHOOTING  \n30. Use the microsurgery curved scissors to successively cut the biliary lobular branches of the left lateral, left middle and right middle lobes between two ligatures.\n  31.  Check the tightness of all the biliary stumps. The only source of bile should be the resected biliary branches; no bile flow should come from the biliary stumps \\(Figure 3c).\n       ?TROUBLESHOOTING  \n32.  Gently place the middle and left lateral lobes to their anatomical location using moistened cotton swabs.\n  33.  Carefully return the intestinal loops into the abdominal cavity.\n  34.  Administer 1ml dextrose-saline \\(4% dextrose, 0.18% saline) or saline \\(0.9%) intraperitoneally, which quickly and easily avoids excessive loss of body fluids that often occurs intraoperatively. \n  35.  Close the aponeurotic layer of the abdominal wall muscle using a continuous running suture with a 3-0 poliglactin 910 suture and a needle holder.\n  36.  Close the skin abdominal incision using a continuous running suture with a 4-0 silk suture and a needle holder.\n  37.  After closing the abdomen, wipe the skin surrounding the suture with clorhexidine.\n  38.  Administer buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously. \n  39.   Place the animal on a warming pad for recovery during 15 minutes\n  \n The entire procedure \\(Steps 1-39) should take approximately 30 minutes and the microsurgical extrahepatic biliary tract resection 20 minutes."
