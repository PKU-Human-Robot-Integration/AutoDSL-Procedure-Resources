Colorimetric signal after selected steps\n(A) After reaction with TMB substrate.\n(B) After addition of stop solution.\n(C) After re-dissolving Janus green B.\n(D) Treatment conditions of each row.\nNote: The concentration of ligand will eventually be at 3 μM after the addition of dose medium containing degrader. The final concentration has been optimized based on pomalidomide, which restored ~50% of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) degradation by degrader WH181. (Wu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Yang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])",
    "Note: Here, we mainly report fixed final concentration at 3 μM for evaluating the cellular affinity of compounds library in comparison of pomalidomide, the positive standard. Comparison between limited number of compounds with more concentration is also applicable by using this type of assay. See Figures 2B and 4C in our previous publication (Wu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Yang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) for examples.\nNote: Prepare ligand, degrader, and vehicle solution by directly diluting the stock solution in cell culture medium. If further dilutions are needed, prepare dilution by adding concentrated dose solution to vehicle solution. For example, add 1 μL 10 mM pomalidomide stock (in DMSO) into 555.6 μL cell culture medium as highest dose solution. Add 2 μL in DMSO into 1,111.1 μL cell culture medium as vehicle solution. Add 100 μL of highest dose solution to 200 μL vehicle solution to make 1:3 dilution. Repeat this dilution if needed.\nIncubate the cells for 1 h at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nDose with 25 μL 600 nM degrader WH181 (6× dose) or vehicle in culture medium.\nNote: The final concentration of degrader will be 100 nM. WH181 (original compound number 12d) is a potent HDAC6 degrader with DC50 at 1.6 nM and anti-myeloma activity. (Wu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])\nCritical: Include controls with treatment condition of “vehicle only,” which was firstly and secondly treated with vehicle, “degrader only,” which was firstly treated with vehicle and secondly treated with degrader, and “pomalidomide,” which was firstly treated with pomalidomide and secondly treated with degrader as positive control in terms of abolishing HDAC6 degradation.\nRedistribute the cells evenly by gently vortexing the culture plate.\nNote: The suspension cells will be redistributed unevenly after adding dose medium, which may result in abnormal signal intensity due to aggregation of cells.",
    "Incubate the cells for 6 h at 37°C with 5% CO2\nPrepare in-plate sample for ELISA\nTiming: 2–3 h, plus 16–18 h incubation\nThis section aims to prepare fixed protein samples in cell culture plate. Cell permeabilization, endogenous peroxidase deactivation, and blocking of non-specific binding site is processed to obtain the best result.\nSpin down the cell culture plate at over 1,000 × g for 3 min.\nNote: Inefficient spin down of cells to the bottom of the well would increase failure of fixation of suspension cells.\nAdd 150 μL of fixation solution (2×) to each well without removing cell culture medium.\nNote: Add fixation solution slowly and gently to wall of plate well to prevent resuspending the cells. Add the fixation solution in fume hood to prevent potential inhaling. Medium containing phenol red will turn into yellow or brown color once fixation solution is added.\nIncubate the plate at room temperature (20°C–23°C) for 15 min (10 min with shaking and then 5 min without shaking).\nCritical: All incubation at 4°C or 20°C–23°C steps within this protocol should be performed with gentle shaking on orbital shaker with shaking speed at 500 rpm for short-term (e.g., washing) and-300 rpm for long-term (e.g., antibody incubation).\nAlternatives: This incubation time can be extended to overnight (16–18 h) at 4°C. However, over-fixation (over 24 h) may increase the risk of failure to obtain final ELISA signal and Janus green stain signal.\nRemove the fixation mixture by vacuum.",
    "Critical: Perform the removing of solution by vacuum without letting adaptor or manifold touch the cells or the bottom of well. If that touching is inevitable, try to stick to vacuum on the same area of well in later steps to avoid losing cells on other areas. The normalization by Janus green (cell density) in later steps become critical for obtaining accurate results.\nNote: Fixation mixture should be disposed into containers according to chemical safety protocol or guideline.\nAdd 300 μL washing buffer.\nQuickly remove the washing buffer by vacuum.\nAdd 300 μL washing buffer.\nIncubate plate at room temperature (20°C–23°C) for at least 3 min.\nRemove washing buffer and repeat washing step one more time.\nNote: Add all buffer and solution slowly and gently to wall of plate wells to prevent resuspending the cells.\nCritical: Steps 17–21 are standard rinsing (steps 17 and 18) and washing steps (steps 19–21). Those steps will be described briefly as “rinse once and wash once, twice or three times with washing buffer” in the following text. Efficient removal of previous reagent or material is critical to obtain clear signal with less background.\nAdd 100 μL permeabilization solution.\nIncubate plate at room temperature (20°C–23°C) for 10 min.\nRemove permeabilization solution by vacuum.\nNote: this step aims to permeabilize the cell membrane and give access to the reagent and antibodies of following steps to target endogenous proteins.\nRinse once and wash once with washing buffer.\nAdd 100 μL quenching solution.\nIncubate plate at room temperature (20°C–23°C) for 20 min.\nNote: this step aims to quench endogenous peroxidases and deactivate their potential enzymatic reactivity with TMB substate in later steps.\nRemove quenching solution by vacuum.\nRinse once and wash once with washing buffer.\nAdd 100 μL antibody buffer 1 without antibodies.",
    "Incubate plate, without shaking, overnight (16–18 h) at 4°C.\nAlternatives: The incubation can be done for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–23°C).\nPause Point: After add antibody buffer 1, the plate can be stored at 4°C for 24–48 h without affecting final result.\nImmunostaining and ELISA readout\nTiming: 5 h\nThis section aims to immunostain the target protein with primary and secondary antibodies, leading to measurement of target protein level.\nRemove antibody buffer 1.\nAdd 50 μL antibody buffer 1 to at least two “vehicle only” wells.\nNote: Those wells will be used as “no-antibody” control or background control.\nAdd 50 μL primary antibody solution to other wells.\nIncubate for 2 h at room temperature (20°C–23°C).\nRemove primary antibody solution by vacuum.\nRinse once and wash three times with washing buffer.\nAdd 100 μL secondary antibody solution to each well.\nIncubate plate for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–23°C).\nNote: Keep strictly to the indicated incubation time. Over-incubation of secondary antibody will slightly decrease the overall signal-to-noise ratio.\nRemove secondary antibody solution from each well by vacuum.\nNote: Secondary antibody is a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate and TMB substrate is extremely sensitive to HRP. Insufficient removal of secondary antibody will significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\nRinse once and wash four times with washing buffer.\nAdd 100 μL TMB substrate mixture to each well.\nNote: Freshly make TMB substrate mixture and store the mixture in a cool dark area if needed.\nIncubate plate in dark for 20 min at room temperature ranging from 20 to 23°C.\nNote: The incubation time can be extended up to 1 h if only limited signal is observed. The resulting reaction mixture has a light blue color. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nAdd 50 μL stop solution to each well.",
    "Incubate plate for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–23°C).\nNote: The reaction mixture will firstly turn green in color upon the addition of stop solution. Then, the mixture will turn a yellow color shortly afterwards. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. Slightly increasing the strength of shaking will facilitate this conversion.\nRead optical density (OD) at 450 nm and 540 nm (background) of each well by plate reader.\nNote: Read the signal within 30 min after the addition of stop solution.\nWhole-cells stain\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section aims to stain the whole cell to determine the cell density, which can be used to normalize the ELISA signal obtained from the previous section.\nRemove TMB reaction mixture by vacuum.\nRinse once and wash three times with washing buffer.\nNote: The TMB reaction mixture is acidic and will affect the staining of Janus green. The mixture should be washed away immediately after reading the signal.\nPause Point: After washing away the TMB substrate, cells can be stored with TBS-T buffer for 24–72 h until the following staining procedures are ready to be done.\nAdd 50 μL staining solution to each well.\nNote: Handle the staining solution carefully to avoid its exposure to any working area or skin.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–23°C).\nNote: Janus green B is a reagent that stains mitochondria in living or fixed cells. (Raspotnig et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])\nNote: Keep strictly to the indicated incubation time. Over-incubation of staining solution will increase the possibility of staining the surface of well wall and bottom, leading to high non-specific staining signal which may not reflect the cell density correctly.\nRemove staining solution by vacuum.\nRinse once and wash four times with washing buffer.",
    "Note: First two washes should use reduced volume (~100 μL) to wash away the staining reagent on the surface of well wall. Efficient removal of excess staining solution is critical to reduce the background of Janus green signal.\nAdd 100 μL equilibrating solution.\nRemove equilibrating solution by vacuum.\nAdd 100 μL solubilization solution.\nIncubate plate for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–23°C).\nNote: Re-dissolving staining reagent results in blue color. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C.\nRead OD at 595 nm and 750 nm (background) of each well by plate reader\nExamples of optimized conditions for other proteins or cells\nThis section aims to show the conditions which have been optimized to measure the level of other proteins or in different cells. Due to change of cell line, reagent (compound, TMB, etc.) or target protein (and corresponding antibody), we recommend optimizing those conditions. See Figure S1A in our previous paper (Wu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) for examples of optimization and validation of in-cell ELISA assay.\nOptimized condition for target engagement assay in Jurkat cell line\nReduce the cell number to 2 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate\nCarefully redistribute the cells after the addition of compounds solution\nNote: Jurkat cell line is a T lymphocyte in suspension manner and widely used in immunology. It is regarded as a difficult cell line to perform transfections due to low content of proteoglycans.(Riedl et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) Successfully determining E3 ligand activity in this type of cell line highlights the utility of this cell-based target engagement assay. The Jurkat cells are recommended to be used within 10 passages.\nOptimized condition for measuring IKZF1 and IKZF3 in MM1S cell line\nFor IKZF1, increase the cell number to 7 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate",
    "For IKZF3, decrease the antibody ratio to 1:2,000 when preparing the primary antibody solution\nFor both, add 25 μL 5× dose medium containing E3 ligands or degraders instead of sequential addition of 25 μL 6× dose medium containing E3 ligands and degraders\nNote: IKZF1 and IKZF3 are neo-substrates of CRBN E3 ligands such as thalidomide, pomalidomide and lenalidomide. It is important to characterize whether E3 ligand(s) or CRBN-based degrader(s) preserve that activity as molecular glue to induce degradation of IKZFs.\nOptimized condition for measuring HDAC6 in MCF-7 cell line\nReduce the cell number to 5 × 103 cells per well in a 96-well plate\nExtend the treatment time of degrader(s) to 12 h\nExclude the spin down step before fixation\nFor fixation, add 1× fixation solution (4% formaldehyde) after remove the medium containing compounds\nNote: MCF-7 is a widely used adherent breast cancer cell line. This example demonstrates the utility of the in-cell ELISA assay to measure the HDAC6 level in cells other than suspension cells. The MCF-7 cells are recommended to be used within 10 passages."
