    "1. Synthesis of nHAP by precipitation\nSynthesize the pristine nHAP using 50 mL of the reaction mixture containing 1 M Ca(NO3)2∙4H2O and 0.67 M (NH4)H2PO4 followed by the dropwise addition of NH4OH (25%) to maintain a pH around 1018.\nThereafter, agitate the reaction mixture by ultrasound irradiation (UI) for 30 min (500 W power and 20 kHz ultrasound frequency).\nAllow the resulting solution to mature for 120 h at room temperature until the white precipitate of nHAP settles out. Recover the nHAP by centrifugation at 1398 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash the precipitate with deionized (DI) water 3x and lyophilize for 48 h. Store the dry powder at 4 °C.\n2. Preparation of nHAP/GNR nanocomposites\nNOTE: The following describes two approaches for fabricating nHAP/GNR (i.e., nHAP on GNR surfaces) and GNR/nHAP (GNR-coated nHAP) nanocomposites that represent two different spatial arrangements of nHAP and GNRs (Figure 1).\nSynthesis of nHAP/GNR\n\t\nTo prepare the nHAP/GNRs nanocomposite, use a co-functionalization strategy where nHAP can be synthesized and conjugated to GNRs simultaneously, as follows.\nDissolve 5 mg of GNRs (Table of Materials) in a mixture of 1 M calcium nitrate tetrahydrate [Ca(NO3)2·4H2O] and 0.67 M diammonium hydrogen phosphate [(NH4)2HPO4] to a 50 mL final volume19.\nDuring this reaction, add 25% of NH4OH dropwise to maintain the pH at ~10. Agitate the resulting mixture by UI for 30 min.\nAfter completion of the reaction, leave the solution undisturbed for 120 h at room temperature until maturation.\nObserve the formation of a gelatinous precipitate of nHAP which coats the GNRs, following which a white precipitate of nHAP/GNRs settles.\nWash the precipitate 3x by centrifugation at 1398 x g for 5 min at room temperature followed by re-dispersion in DI water.",
    "Lyophilize the recovered washed precipitate for 48 h. Store the dry powder at 4 °C.\nUse pristine nHAP and GNRs as control samples.\nSynthesis of GNR/nHAP nanocomposite\n\t\nSuspend commercially available nHAP at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in 50 mL of DI water supplemented with 5 mg of GNRs.\nAgitate the resulting mixture by UI for 30 min and thereafter leave the mixture undisturbed for 120 h at room temperature.\nAfter maturation, recover the white precipitate of the resulting GNR/nHAP by centrifugation at 1398 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash the sample 3x using DI water, lyophilize it for 48 h, and store the dry powder at 4 °C for further use.\n3. Characterization of nHAP, nHAP/GNR, and GNR/nHAP\nUse a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) (see Table of Materials) to characterize the morphology and size of the nanocomposites11.\nAnalyze the elemental composition of the nanocomposites employing energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and perform elemental mapping using the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)11.\nPerform Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the neat samples at wavenumbers of 500-4000 cm−1 to analyze the chemical groups in the nanocomposite16.\nPerform powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the as-synthesized nHAP using an X-ray wavelength of 1.5406 Å, current and voltage settings of 40 mA and 40 kV, respectively, and 2θ ranging from 20° to 90°.\nEvaluate the percent loading of GNR in the nanocomposite using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) by heating the samples from room temperature to 1000 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen flow.\nSubscription Required.
