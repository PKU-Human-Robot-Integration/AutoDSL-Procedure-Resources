    "In general:Work under sterile conditions, e.g., under a laminar flow hood.Disinfect reagents and consumables before transferring under the hood.All media should be prepared fresh and used within one week.Do not thaw N-2 Supplement and B-27 Supplement in the water bath. Instead thaw them at room temperature (RT, 20-22 °C) for 2-4 h or in the fridge (4 °C) over night.All media should be pre-warmed before applying to the cells. Do not keep the media at 37 °C for long periods but rather pre-warm at RT.Culture the NPCs and iPSCs in a controlled environment with 37 °C and 5% CO2.Optional: If possible, culture the iPSCs under hypoxic conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2, 5% O2), which more closely mimics in vivo conditions.We culture iPSCs under feeder-free conditions in either StemMACSTM iPS-Brew XF, or mTeSRTM1 on Matrigel-coated 6-well plates.We passage iPSCs using 0.5 mM EDTA/PBS in ratios ranging from 1:4-1:12. To increase cell survival, we recommend adding ROCK inhibitor (RI) after each splitting in a concentration of 10 µM.Step-by-step protocol for NPC generationDay 0 (Monday): Harvesting of the iPSCs and transfer on Corning Ultra-Low Attachment 60mm/15mm dishes. Prepare the basic medium 1 (BM1) (Table 1).Prepare M1 medium (Table 2).Choose one to two wells of iPSCs (~80% confluent).Remove the media and rinse the wells twice with DPBS to remove dead cells and debris.Detach cells from the plate using Accutase (1 mg/ml). Add 0.5-1 ml/well and incubate for 2-5 min at 37 °C, check visually in between.Continue when colonies are mainly detaching from the plate.Add 4-10 ml PBS or medium to reduce Accutase activity.Optional: Mechanically detach cells using a cell spatula if cells are not completely detached by Accutase activity.Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml Falcon tube (pool both wells), let the cells settle to the bottom (10-15 min) in water bath.",
    "Optional: Centrifuge at 120 × g for 5 min (potentially more damaging but faster and results in a more solid pellet).Remove as much medium as possible from the sedimented cells by pipetting (for example with a 5 ml serological pipette). Make sure not to disperse or suck up the cells.Add 5 ml of M1 to the cells, transfer the cells to a non-treated Corning Ultra-Low Attachment 60 mm/15 mm dish (1:1; or X number of wells in case of high confluence).Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 days.Incubation with M1 will form embryoid bodies (EBs) floating in the media. If they attach at day 1 to the bottom of the Corning Ultra-Low attachment 60 mm/15 mm dish, detach them by gently pipetting using a 1 ml pipette (cut off the tip with sterile scissors!). Make sure not to shred the floating EBs. Alternatively, use a cell spatula. Keep the media in the well and gently scrape throughout the well using a cell spatula to detach EBs.Day 2 (Wednesday): 50% media exchange to M2 Prepare BM2 (sm-) medium (Table 1).Prepare M2 medium (Table 2).Cut off the tip of a 1 ml pipet tip using a sterile scissor.Transfer EBs to a 15 ml Falcon tube using a 1 ml pipette tip (cut off the tip!).Optional: If some EBs attached, detach EBs using a cell spatula.Let EBs settle for 15 min in the water bath at 37 °C.Remove 50% of M1 and add 50% of M2 instead.Optional: Remove all M1 and add 100% M2 (but potentially more damaging for the cells).Transfer the EBs back to the same Corning Ultra-Low Attachment 60 mm/15 mm dish using a 1 ml pipette tip (cut off the tip using a sterile scissor!).Day 3 (Thursday): 100% media exchange to M2 Prepare M2 medium (Table 2).",
    "Cut off the tip of a 1 ml pipet tip using a sterile scissor.Transfer EBs to a 15 ml Falcon tube using a 1 ml pipette tip (cut off the tip!).Optional: If necessary, detach EBs using a cell spatula as described before.Let EBs settle for 15 min in the water bath at 37 °C.Exchange the medium completely to 100% of M2 medium (5-6 ml final volume).Transfer EBs back to the same Corning Ultra-Low Attachment 60 mm/15 mm dish using a 1 ml pipette tip (cut off the tip using a sterile scissor!).Day 4 (Friday): 100% media exchange to M3 (sm+) and preparation of Matrigel-coated plates Prepare M3 (sm+) medium (Table 2).Cut off the tip of a 1 ml pipet tip using a sterile scissor.Transfer EBs to a 15 ml Falcon tube using a 1 ml pipette tip (cut off the tip!).Optional: If necessary, detach EBs using a cell spatula as described before.Let EBs settle for 15 min in the water bath at 37 °C.Exchange the media completely to 100% of M3 (sm+) medium (5-6 ml final volume).Transfer EBs back to the same Corning Ultra-Low Attachment 60 mm/15 mm dish using a 1 ml pipette tip (cut off the tip using a sterile scissor!).Coat a 6-well plate with Matrigel (procedure described separately) as preparation for day 7.Day 7 (Monday): Transfer the cells to Matrigel-coated plates Prepare M3 (sm+) medium (Table 2).Transfer EBs from the Corning Ultra-Low Attachment 60 mm/15 mm dish to a 15 ml Falcon tube. Use a 1 ml tip (cut off the tip!).If necessary, detach neural tube-like formations using a cell spatula as described for EBs.Let EBs settle down in the water bath at 37 °C (10-15 min).Remove old media.Add new sm+ medium.Shred the cell formations by pipetting 5-10 times using a normal 1 ml tip.",
    "Transfer the whole suspension to the Matrigel-coated 6-well plate, distribute equally to 2-X wells depending on the amount of EBs.Fill up to 2 ml sm+ each 6-well.Add ROCK inhibitor (RI) (10 µM final concentration).Note: To increase cell survival, we recommend adding RI to the cells for the first 1-2 splittings. Afterwards, RI is not needed! Check the next day, NPC-like cells should be already visible (see Figure 1A–right image, and Figure 1E).Try to keep the cells in the first well for 1 week.If necessary, split the cells as described in the maintenance protocol.Note: NPCs should appear homogenous after 4-5 passages, expressing NESTIN, PAX6, and SOX2. NPCs usually also express the immature pan-neuronal marker TUJ1. Spontaneous differentiation can occur, and some cells can express the neuronal marker MAP2. Cells do not necessarily need to be cultured in 6-well plates. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3939/bioprotoc-11-05-3939-g001.jpgFigure 1.  Generation and characterization of human iPSC-derived NPCs.  A.

    "Matrigel preparationThaw frozen Matrigel (stored at -20 °C) OVERNIGHT (ON) on ice at +4 °C.Check protein concentration (stock concentration) of Matrigel as provided in Lot datasheet.Calculation: Add a specific volume (=x) of cold KnockOut-DMEM to the 10 ml thawed Matrigel in the vial to dilute it to 5 mg/ml final concentration. The stock concentration of your vial (= y) should be written on the lot datasheet. Calculate the needed volume using the formula: x = y * 2-10 ml.Perform next steps under the hood and on ice!Prepare a pre-chilled 50 ml Falcon tube with specific volume of cold KnockOut-DMEM.Prepare pre-chilled 15 ml Falcon tubes on ice labeled with 1 M.Transfer Matrigel quickly to KnockOut-DMEM and mix carefully.Aliquot 1 ml of the diluted Matrigel in each pre-chilled 15 ml Falcon tube.Store Aliquots immediately at -20 °C.Final concentration in 6/12-well-plates: 200 µg/ml.Coating plates with MatrigelTransfer 30 ml cold KnockOut-DMEM into a 50 ml Falcon tube.Dilute 1 ml aliquot 1:30 in cold KnockOut-DMEM.Resuspend the 1 ml Matrigel aliquot (15 ml Falcon tube, -20 °C) with 5 ml of the 30 ml cold KnockOut-DMEM in the 15 ml Falcon tube until pellet is resolved! (It may take a while).1 ml Matrigel aliquot resuspended in 30 ml cold KnockOut-DMEM as described in C2 is enough for 4 plates.6-well: 1.25 ml.12-well: 500 µl.24-well: 300 µl.Add Matrigel-medium to the wells (see point 4).Polymerization:Store at 4 °C in the fridge, ON (preferentially!).2 h at 37 °C is possible.Check polymerization in phase contrast before use! The evenly distributed formation of an extracellular matrix should be visible (Figure 1B). Coated plates can be stored for 1-2 weeks (4 °C). For storage seal the plates with Parafilm.Before use, pre-warm the plate either at RT or 37 °C.Maintenance of NPC culturesMedia needs to be changed every 2nd day.",
    "Media should be pre-warmed before applying to the cells. Do not keep media at 37 °C for long periods but rather pre-warm at RT.Typically, cells were split using Accutase in ratios of 1:3 up to 1:10 every 4-5 days depending on the cell density.Splitting NPCsAspirate growth media.Add 500 μl Accutase and incubate for 2-5 min at RT or 37 °C if cells do not detach easily.Dilute Accutase activity by addition of 2 ml sm- (without any supplementation) or PBS.Gently detach the cells by pipetting.Transfer the cells to a 15 ml Falcon tube and centrifuge at 200 × g for 3 min at RT.In the meantime, prepare Matrigel-coated plates for plating the cells.Aspirate Matrigel-mix.Add 1 ml sm+ and store in the incubator until further use.Fill blank wells with 2 ml DPBS.Note: Matrigel coating should not dry out. Aspirate the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in sm+ medium.Distribute cells to Matrigel-coated 6-well plates.Fill up with media to 2 ml sm+.Note: To increase cell survival, we recommend adding RI (10 µM) to the cells for the first 1-2 splittings. Afterwards, RI is not needed! Freezing NPCsDetach NPCs according to the splitting procedure.Resuspend NPCs in 0.5 ml of sm+. Add freezing medium (2× sm+ freeze:sm+, 1:1).Note: 10 ml of  2× sm+ freeze  is prepared by mixing 2 ml of sm+, 6 ml of KnockOut-SR, and 2 ml of DMSO. Alternatively, use commercial freezing media according to manufacturer’s protocol.Note: For example, Bambanker (Nippon Genetics, catalog number:  BB03  ). Transfer the resuspended NPCs into a cryovial and place the vials at -80 °C in a cryo-freezing container.Note: Use a freezing container such as Mr. FrostyTM (Nalgene) to freeze the cells, which allows slow freezing at a rate of -1 °C per minute.",
    "Store NPCs at -80 °C or in a liquid nitrogen tank for long term storage (1-3 years).Thawing NPCsQuickly but gently thaw the cryovial containing NPCs in a 37 °C pre-warmed water bath.Transfer NPCs into a 15 ml Falcon tube set with 1 ml of sm+ and up to 10 ml of pre-warmed PBS.Centrifuged the cells at 200 × g for 3 min.Remove the supernatant and resuspend NPCs in sm+ medium.Seed NPCs on previously prepared Matrigel-coated plates 1:1 (see Coating plates with Matrigel). Note: Add 10 µM RI after thawing to support cell survival. Characterization of NPCs by immunofluorescenceAfter 4-6 passages, seed NPCs on Matrigel-coated 24-well plates containing 12 mm coverslips. When reaching approximately 80% of confluence, rinse NPCs with PBS, and fix the cells with a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS solution for 15 min at RT.Remove the PFA and rinse NPCs with PBS calcium/magnesium free (PBS -/-) 3 times for 5 min.Add blocking solution to the cells for 1 h at RT.Note: Blocking solution is prepared with 10% donkey serum and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS -/- with 0.1% Tween-20. Incubate the cells with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C on an orbital shaker (60-80 rpm).Note: Dilute primary antibody in blocking solution. Following antibodies are commonly used in our laboratory: NESTIN (Millipore, 1:200), PAX6 (Covance, 1:200), SOX2 (Santa Cruz, 1:100), DACH1 (ProteinTech, 1:100), TUJ-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:1,000), MAP2 (Synaptic system, 1:1,000). Rinse the cells with PBS -/-, 3 times for 5 min.Incubate the cells with a specific secondary antibody and Hoechst staining (1:2500) for nucleus visualization for at least 1 h at RT.Note: Dilute secondary antibodies 1:300 using blocking solution.",
    "Following secondary antibodies are commonly used in our laboratory: Alexa FluorTM 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Alexa FluorTM 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), donkey anti-goat Cy 3 (Sigma-Aldrich) and donkey anti-guinea pig Cy 3 (Sigma-Aldrich). Rinse the cells with PBS -/-, 3 times for 5 min.Invert coverslips and mount them to a glass slide using mounting medium (IMMU-MOUNTTM or similar). After the mounting medium is dry the samples can be analyzed by confocal imaging.Characterization of NPCs by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)Prepare SYBR Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s description.Pipette the PCR master mix and the cDNA samples into the 384-Well Optical Reaction Plates (Applied Biosystems).Note: RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the RNeasy Mini Kit (50) from Qiagen according to the manufacturers protocol. cDNA was generated using the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) Reverse Transcriptase kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific according to the manufacturers protocol. For each target gene, cDNA samples and negative controls should be measured in biological triplicates. Set the PCR cycle conditions as follows: 1 cycle 50 °C 2 min, 1 cycle 95 °C 10 min, 40 cycles 95 °C 15 s  60 °C 30 s  72 °C 30 s, 1 cycle 72 °C 10 min.Primers used were:For OCT4 F: GTGGAGGAAGCTGACAACAA and R: ATTCTCCAGGTTGCCTCTCAFor NANOG F: CCTGTGATTTGTGGGCCTG and R: GACAGTCTCCGTGTGAGGCATFor SOX2 F: GTATCAGGAGTTGTCAAGGCAGAG and R: TCCTAGTCTTAAAGAGGCAGCAAACFor DNMT3B F: GCTCACAGGGCCCGATACTT and R: GCAGTCCTGCAGCTCGAGTTTAFor DPP4 F: TGGTGTCAGGTGGTGTGTGG and R: CCAGGCTTGACCAGCATGAAFor VIM F: GGAGCTGCAGGAGCTGAATG and R: GACTTGCCTTGGCCCTTGAGFor NESTIN F: TTCCCTCAGCTTTCAGGAC and R: GAGCAAAGATCCAAGACGCFor PAX6 F: GAATTCTGCAGACCCATGC and R TCTCGTAATACCTGCCCAGFor SOX1 F: TTGGCATCTAGGTCTTGGCTCA and R: CGGGCGCACTAACTCAGCTTFor SOX2 F: GTATCAGGAGTTGTCAAGGCAGAG and R: TCCTAGTCTTAAAGAGGCAGCAAACFor GAPDH F: CTGGTAAAGTGGATATTGTTGCCAT and R: TGGAATCATATTGGAACATGTAAACC"
