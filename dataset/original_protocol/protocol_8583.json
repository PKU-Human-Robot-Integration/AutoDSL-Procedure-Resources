    "1. Preparation of Larvae\nRaise stocks or genetic crosses in a 25 ºC incubator.\n\t\nIf culturing a cross, use 20-25 virgin females and 15-20 males per vial containing regular cornmeal fly media. Allow females to lay eggs for approximately 48 h before transferring them to a new vial of food.\n4-5 days after egg lay, collect 3rd instar larvae of the desired genotype by gently squirting a stream of water into the mushy food and larvae, and pour out the contents into a medium-sized, clean petri dish (60 mm x 15 mm).\nNext, gently sort larvae by size using forceps or a paintbrush to preclude larger \"wandering 3rd instar\" or small sickly larvae from being tested. Discard larvae containing any undesired genetic markers or balancers.\nHave a fellow lab member label dishes or containers where sorted larvae will be placed so that the experimenter can be \"blind\" to the experimental condition or genotype of the larvae if applicable. The experimenter can apply decoded labels to collected data after the experiment using a key generated by a lab-member.\nUsing a scoopula, transfer a dime-sized amount of fresh food into a (35 mm x 10 mm or 60 mm x 15 mm) clean, labeled Petri dish filled half-way with room temperature water.\nGently move the sorted larvae onto the food (to prevent starvation or desiccation if testing is anticipated to take more than 20 min) using forceps or paintbrush.\n2. Cold Probe Assay\nTurn on the cold probe unit allowing a few min for it to cool to the desired temperature. If setting to lower temperatures, condensation will likely form along the probe.",
    "Wipe away any excess moisture with a laboratory wipe before application to the larva. When not in immediate use, place insulating cap on probe to both insulate and to keep the tip clean and prevent damage.\nPlace a mid 3rd instar larva onto a thin piece of dark moveable vinyl (typically, use a small piece cut from a notebook binder) under a bright field microscope. The black vinyl aids in contrast visualization and in moving the larva without touching it to align it properly with the probe.\nAdjust the microscope (see Table of Materials) and light unit (see Table of Materials) to medium brightness (50-75% max brightness) to provide contrast and prevent the larva from drying out too quickly.\nDiscard any larvae that do not first exhibit normal peristaltic locomotion as they could confound the results. The larva should be moist from the Petri dish of water otherwise the larva will stick to the vinyl inhibiting normal locomotion. Water should not puddle around the larva.\nAdvance the probe by hand towards the larva at a 90º angle to the anteroposterior body axis, using the vinyl to move the larva into correct position (see Figure 1A).\nOrient the tip of the probe to gently lay across the mid dorsal surface of the larva with the probe at approximately a 45º angle to the microscope stage.\nUpon probe contact, start a laboratory timer. Apply enough downward pressure to slightly indent the surface of the larval cuticle while still allowing forward or backward movement.\nHold the probe in place for up to 10 s or until a cold-evoked behavioral response is observed - whichever occurs first. Then remove the probe.",
    "Record the observed behavioral response and the response latency. Larvae that do not respond within 10 s are considered \"non-responders\". Latency can also be recorded for responders and used to measure changes in response robustness/amplitude.\nDiscard larva and prepare the next.\nRepeat steps 2.3-2.11 until the desired number of test larvae is reached (three sets of n = 20-40 larvae were used here).\nSubscription Required.
