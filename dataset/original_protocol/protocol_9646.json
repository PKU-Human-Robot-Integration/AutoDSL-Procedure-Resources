    "1. Preparation of the plates and media\nNOTE: A typical extracellular matrix (ECM)-based hydrogel aliquot is ~200 µL in a sterile 1.5 mL tube stored at −20 °C.\nIn a sterile tissue culture hood, prepare a sterile 6-well plate by transferring 2 mL of 0.1% gelatin (Table of Materials) to each well. Place the lid on the 6-well plate, and allow the coated plate to incubate at 37 °C for a minimum of 1 h.\nOne day before seeding the hiPSC-CMs on the flexible hydrogel substrate, thaw a hydrogel (Table of Materials) aliquot in the refrigerator on ice.\nPrepare the cardiomyocyte medium (Table of Materials) by mixing 500 mL of RPMI 1640, 10 mL of 50x B-27 Supplement, and 5 mL of penicillin-streptomycin9.\n2. Seeding of cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs\nTwo days before seeding the hiPSC-CMs on the flexible hydrogel substrate, pre-plate the hiPSC-CMs on 0.1% gelatin-coated sterile 6-well plates. Thaw the hiPSC-CMs using a standard thawing protocol9,25.\nThen, plate 1,500,000 total hiPSC-CMs (Table of Materials) per well according to the manufacturer's instructions (Figure 1A)26.\nCulture the hiPSC-CMs in standard cardiomyocyte medium for 2-4 days to allow the hiPSC-CMs to recover from the cryopreservation at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Refresh the spent medium with 100% cardiomyocyte medium every 48 h.\n3. Dissociation and counting of the pre-plated hiPSC-CMs\nCheck the status of the hiPSC-CMs before dissociation. Evaluate the health of the hiPSC-CMs, ensuring viability and stable beating.\n\tNOTE: The purity of the hiPSC-CM population is important (e.g., >90% cardiac troponin T)7. A cardiomyocyte selection method (e.g., metabolic selection or sorting) is recommended to reduce the disruption of the hydrogel substrate by non-cardiomyocyte cells25,26.",
    "Wash the hiPSC-CMs 2x with 4 mL per well of D-PBS without CaCl2 or MgCl2 (Table of Materials). Aspirate the D-PBS, add 1 mL of room temperature dissociation reagent to each well, and then incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 10 mL of cardiomyocyte medium to a sterile 15 mL conical tube.\nDissociate the hiPSC-CMs from the 6-well plate with a 1,000 µL pipette (Figure 1B). Add the cell suspension to the 15 mL conical tube26.\nRinse the well with 1 mL of fresh cardiomyocyte medium to collect any residual hiPSC-CMs, and add them to the 15 mL conical tube. Bring the final volume of the conical tube to 15 mL.\nCentrifuge for 5 min (200 × g). Remove the supernatant up to the 1 mL mark. Resuspend the cells in cardiomyocyte medium to a final volume of 5 mL.\nCount the hiPSC-CMs with a manual or automated cell counter.\nIncubate the hiPSC-CM suspension at room temperature while the flexible hydrogel substrates are being prepared (30 min maximum).\n4. Preparation of the flexible hydrogel substrates\nPrepare a 20 µL pipette set at 1 µL, 20 µL pipette tips (e.g., 20 µL), and a sterile 48-well glass bottom plate. Ensure that a stopwatch/timer is ready ahead of making the hydrogel substrates.\nIn the sterile tissue culture hood, mix the ECM-based hydrogel substrate by gently tapping the tube, and immediately place it back on ice.\nThen, start the stopwatch/timer immediately before the first hydrogel substrate is plated-this is time zero.",
    "Pipette 1 µL of the hydrogel substrate up and down ~3x to chill the pipette tip. Apply ~1 µL of the undiluted hydrogel substrate horizontally to the bottom of each well of the 48-well plate (Figure 1C, Figure 2A, and Figure 3A), holding the pipette at a 45° angle. Plate all the hydrogel substrates in the same orientation in each well (Figure 2 and Figure 3) to help identify the substrate when performing the experiments at 40x magnification7,9,17,27.\n\tNOTE: Each ~1 µL line is one hydrogel substrate (Figure 3). Typically, it takes ~5 min to prepare 48 wells. The use of a horizontally tilted microplate stand (e.g., 30°) may enable a better view of the bottom of the well and the hydrogel substrate. Be sure to go the entire length of the well (i.e., from left to right). Short hydrogel substrates may be too thick, thus reducing the substrate stability. Do not allow the hydrogel substrate to dry in the pipette tip. If this occurs, quickly switch to a new tip, and immediately continue. Alternatively, chilled pipette tips can be used. The ECM-based hydrogel substrate may quickly polymerize when it is not on ice. The preparation of several wells at a time (e.g., 10) is suggested. Additionally, practicing in a mock 48-well plate is recommended.\nPlace the lid on the 48-well plate, and allow the hydrogel substrates to incubate for 8-10 min at room temperature in the sterile tissue culture hood before adding the cells (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: It is important to adhere to the suggested incubation times. An incubation time of more than 10 min will lead to stiff hydrogel substrates and no visible contractions. An incubation time of less than 8 min may lead to substrates that collapse.",
    "Immediately seed the hiPSC-CMs dropwise directly onto the hydrogel substrates, with ~30,000 viable hiPSC-CMs per well in a low medium volume of ~200 µL of cardiomyocyte medium, using a 1,000 µL pipette (Figure 2B and Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: This process halts the hydrogel substrate polymerization and ensures the hiPSC-CMs are on the substrate7,9,17,27.\nPlace the lid on the plate, and allow the hiPSC-CMs to incubate undisturbed for 10-15 min at room temperature (Figure 2C) in the sterile tissue culture hood to enable the hiPSC-CMs to adhere to the hydrogel substrate.\nGently add ~100 µL of fresh cardiomyocyte medium to each well (final volume: ~300 µL per well). Place the lid on the plate, and transfer to an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2-4 days. Refresh the 100% medium every 24 h before the contraction experiments are performed.\n\tNOTE: Visually inspect the hiPSC-CMs for the correct morphology; immediately after plating, the hiPSC-CMs should appear round (Figure 3B). By day 2 after seeding, a confluent 2D hiPSC-CM monolayer syncytium will be observed (Figure 3C) (Supplemental Video S1) with robust visible contraction (Supplemental Video S2).\n5. Contraction recording and analysis\nPrepare the CCM assay medium, which is Tyrode's solution containing the following (in mmol/L): CaCl2 0.5, NaCl 134, KCl 5.4, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, and HEPES 10, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH, and equilibrate to 37 °C in a water bath.\n\tNOTE: Submaximal extracellular calcium (0.5 mM) is used to enhance the CCM assay window.\nTurn on the microscope and environmental control chamber to equilibrate to 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the cardiomyocyte medium from the 48-well plate, and gently rinse each well twice with 600 µL of CCM assay medium.",
    "Add 300 µL of CCM assay medium per well, and place the 48-well plate on the microscope in the environmental control chamber. Insert the electrodes, and equilibrate the cells for 5 min.\nUse video-based microscopy to record the contraction videos. Open the video recording software, and set a frame rate of 100 frames/s. Select a region of interest (ROI) near the center of the hiPSC-CM monolayer.\n\tNOTE: Do not select an ROI near the edge of the hiPSC-CM monolayers as this may be unstable for contractile recordings.\nThen, field stimulate the cells with a commercial pulse generator (Table of Materials) to electrically pace the 2D hiPSC-CM monolayers. Pace the hiPSC-CMs at 1.5x threshold at 1 Hz with baseline pulse parameters (e.g., monophasic square wave pacing pulses with a 2 ms stimulus pulse duration of ~14 V/cm)17.\nRecord the baseline, pacing only (i.e., before the CCM) (Figure 1D) contraction video for a minimum of five beats17,28.\nThen, stimulate the hiPSC-CM monolayer with an experimental electrical signal (Figure 1D). To follow this protocol, use the standard CCM stimulation parameters: two symmetrical biphasic pulses of 5.14 ms phase duration (20.56 ms total duration), ~28 V/cm (phase amplitude), zero interphase interval, and a 30 ms delay (i.e., time from the end of the pacing pulse to the beginning of the CCM pulse) (Figure 1D)29,30, and record the CCM-induced contraction video for a minimum of five beats.\nTurn off the CCM signal, stimulate with a baseline pacing pulse, and record a contraction video of the recovery period (i.e., after the CCM) for a minimum of five beats.\nUse standard contraction software to automatically analyze the contraction videos and quantify the key contractile properties (e.g., the contraction amplitude, contraction slope, relaxation slope, time to peak, time to baseline 90%, and contraction duration 50%)7,17,31,32.",
