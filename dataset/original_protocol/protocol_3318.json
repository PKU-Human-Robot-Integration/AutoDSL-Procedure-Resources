Dead (or dying) YAC-1 (shown in red) are located in the\n              diagonal on the scatter plots. Live YAC-1 is shown in blue. The\n              cells indicated in light blue are CFSE-negative cells including\n              the effector cells (reMAIT and NK) (rightmost columns).\n            \n        Calculate “percent lysis” using the following formula: {(% of Zombie+\n        cells among target cells in the presence of effector cells) - (% of\n        Zombie+ cells among target cells in the absence of effector\n        cells)}/ {100 − (% of Zombie+ cells among target cells in the",
    "absence of effector cells)}/100.\n      \nNote: Because YAC-1 culture contains many\n      dead cells, a significant number of Zombie+ cells are detected\n      even in the absence of effector cells (high background).\n    \nCritical: Be sure to use 1 μM CFSE.\n      The use of more or less concentrated CFSE would make it difficult to\n      identify the CSFE-positive cells within the FITC-channel in flow\n      cytometry.\n    \nCytolytic activity of reMAIT cells against LLC\nTiming: 3 days\n      LLC is adherent and is generally resistant to killing by cytolytic CD8+\n      T cells and NK cells. We found that reMAIT cells can kill LLC by\n      co-culturing for 16–20 h using the following strategies.\n    \n        Plating of LLC (Day 0).\n        \n            Trypsinize semi-confluent LLC and prepare 1 × 105\n            cells/mL cell suspension in 8% FBS/DMEM.\n          \n            Spread 100 μL per well of the cell suspension into a 96-well\n            flat-bottom culture plate (1 × 104 cells/well).\n          \nIncubate at 37°C for 16–20 h in CO2 incubator.\n        Co-culture of LLC and reMAIT cells and/or NK cells (Day 1).\n        \nPrepare 3 × 106 of reMAIT cells.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\n            Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of cR10 (final concentration at\n            3 × 106 cells/mL).\n          \n            Make the following dilution for reMAIT cells.\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_3084_20.csv\n            Prepare 1 mL of 3 × 106 cells/mL NK cells in cR10 by\n            using the NK cell suspension from step 34.\n          \n            Make the following dilution of NK cells.\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_3084_21.csv\n            Remove the medium from each well of 96-well plate of LLC culture\n            (see step 47).\n          \n            Add appropriate amounts of reMAIT cells in a 96-well plate seeded\n            with LLC in triplicate as shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_3084_22.csv\nIncubate for 16–20 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.\n        Live/dead staining using Zombie dye (Day 2).\n        \nDilute Zombie Violet in PBS at 1:1000.",
