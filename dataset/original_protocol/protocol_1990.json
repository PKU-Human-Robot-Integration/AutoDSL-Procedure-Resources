    "The micropatterns can be obtained by microcontact printing: PDMS stamps are covered with a solution of laminin. Then, the excess of laminin solution is removed, and the stamps are carefully pressed on the surface of the imaging dish for imprinting the desired features on it (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C) (Fink et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Xia and Whitesides, 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37]). The rest of the surface is then passivated to prevent the cells from attaching outside of the stamped features. For routine migration assays, micropatterns are made on 35-mm plastic bacterial plates. For Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) or confocal imaging, micropatterns are made on glass-bottom dishes that are first silanized to help the laminin to adsorb better to the glass. The passivation on plastic is performed with pluronic solution while the passivation on glass is performed with PLL-g-PEG working solution. A good alternative to the microcontact printing on glass is the technique of deep UV photolithography that is also described here (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) (Azioune et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Deep UV photolithography consists of first coating coverslips with PLL-g-PEG and then burning it with the desired features using a photomask and deep UV. The regions that have been burned can be subsequently coated with the desired substrate (in our case, laminin, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Deep UV photolithography is easier than the microcontact printing on glass and less prone to variations due to the experimenter. It is preferable when protein concentration has to be finely tuned, for substrate concentration comparison for example. However, since laminin adsorbs much better on plastic, micro-contact printing on plastic is preferred for long-term cultures or for large micropatterns where many cells need to adhere (Monzo et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]).",
    "In this case, cells can stay attached to the patterns for many days whereas on glass, high-density cultures can rip off the laminin substrates rapidly.",
    "imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1588-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Deep-UV photolithography\n(A) Principles of deep-UV lithography. PEGylated coverslips are placed on the chrome mask, bubbles are removed and the PLL-g-PEG is burned through the micropatterns drawn on the photomask, by deep UV, for 10 min. The coverslips are then mounted either on an imaging chamber or on a 35-mm dish with a hole, and coated with laminin at 37°C for 1 h.\n(B) Main steps of deep-UV lithography: (a) acid washed and air-dried coverslips are placed in a coverslip holder for plasma cleaning. (b) plasma cleaned coverslips are coated with PEG-g-PLL. (c) PEGylated coverslips are placed onto a drop of milliQ water covering the micropatterns on the chrome mask. (d) The chrome mask is placed in the deep-UV machine coverslips facing down. (e) The coverslips are lifted from the chrome mask using milliQ water. (f) Micropatterned coverslips are mounted in magnetic imaging chambers.\nNote: Sterility is not needed to perform the steps 1–3. However, at the very end of steps 2 and 3, dishes are transferred under a biosafety cabinet to be rinsed with sterile PBS and filled with culture medium under sterile conditions.\nSilanization of glass bottom dishes:\nIncubate the glass-bottom dishes in silane solution (1.2 μL of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyl methacrylate diluted in 2 mL methanol per dish) for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nRemove silane solution and rinse three times with methanol for 5 min each time on a rocker.\nRemove the methanol and air-dry the dishes under the chemical hood to evaporate the leftover methanol.\nProceed with the stamping procedure as indicated in step 2.",
    "Critical: Silane vapors are toxic and highly flammable. The steps involving silane should be conducted in a chemical fume hood. Once silanized, the glass bottom dishes can be kept overnight (12–20 h), at room temperature (20°C–25°C), protected from dust, before micro-contact printing.\nMicro-contact printing and passivation:\nUsing a scalpel, cut out the desired features (stamps are around 1 cm2) and place them in a small culture dish (the features must be facing up).\nRemove the lid of the dish to expose the stamps and place it in the plasma cleaner. Start the vacuum pump, switch ON the plasma cleaner for 3 min (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C-d). This step makes the surface of the PDMS stamps hydrophilic and facilitates the coating of the stamps.\nAdd 20 μL of laminin solution (50 μg/mL in DPBS) on top of the stamps, and incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 30 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Fluorescent BSA can be added to the laminin solution in order to visualize the stamped area at the microscope. We usually mix BSA-Cy5 at a final concentration of 7 μg/mL with our laminin solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C-f) (Monzo et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nUsing a tweezer, hold the stamp, and air-blow dry all the laminin (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C-e), turn the stamp upside down and press it gently onto the imaging dish.\nCritical: No micro-droplets must be left on the edges of the stamp. Due to capillarity, they might flow in between the features of the stamp. However, an excessive air-blow dry of the stamp detaches the coating. Therefore, we recommend leaning the side of the stamp onto a kimwipe as a first step: this removes the majority of the coating solution. Then air-blow dry the stamp.\nAfter 1–2 min remove the stamp from the imaging dish in a single motion.",
    "Critical: The stamp must not be shaken while leaning. To remove it, we use two tweezers. This helps to leverage the stamp and avoids smearing the pattern. We never re-use the stamps and each stamp is meant for 1 dish.\nIn case of plastic dishes, add 2 mL of pluronic solution per dish. In case of glass-bottom dishes, add 300 μL of PLL-g-PEG working solution per dish. Incubate 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nTransfer the dishes under a biosafety cabinet, aspirate the solutions of pluronic and PLL-g-PEG and replace with 2 mL of sterile DPBS, rinse 5 times with dPBS and replace with 2 mL GSC medium and 40 μL of growth factor mix. The dishes are now ready for cell seeding.\nNote: We never store the dishes with pluronic, PLL-g-PEG or DPBS, we recommend to store them in GSC medium at 37°C and to seed the cells within 24 hours (preferably the same day of micro-contact printing).\nDeep UV photolithography.\nPick up the coverslips from the ethanol solution and dry them one by one with an air-gun. Transfer them to a clean rack (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B-a).\nPlace the rack containing the dried coverslips in a plasma cleaner, start the vacuum pump, switch ON the plasma cleaner for 3 min.\nDrop 100 μL PLL-g-PEG working solution (100 μg/mL) on the bottom of a petri dish previously covered with a layer of parafilm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B-b).\nFlip the coverslips onto the drops and incubate 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nUsing a tweezer, rinse the coverslips in a beaker containing milliQ water, and let them dry on a paper towel, the PEG-PLL facing up.\nClean the photomask with isopropanol and carefully dry it with a kimwipe or airflow.",
    "Place the photomask under deep UV for 5 min (golden side facing up) to make it more hydrophilic.\nPlace the photomask (golden side facing up) onto the bench, drop 4 μL of milliQ water onto the desired pattern and flip the coverslip on the drop. The PLL-g -PEG must be in contact with the mask (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B-c).\nRemove all the bubbles between the mask and the coverslip by gently pressing on the coverslip with the tip of the tweezer.\nCritical: Always wear protective nitrile gloves when manipulating the mask to avoid leaving fingerprints. Make sure to remove the bubbles since they interfere with the mask design. Some user might find it easier to remove the bubbles by pressing gently the cover slip with the tip of the finger. If using a metallic tweezer, be careful to not touch the patterns of the mask with the tweezer as it may scratch easily. If possible use a plastic tweezer.\nPlace the mask (golden side facing down) under deep UV for 10 min (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B-d).\nPlace the mask, face-up, on a paper towel, spray milliQ water onto the coverslips and let them detach (do not force them to detach to avoid smearing the PLL-g-PEG, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B-e).\nRinse the coverslips in milliQ water and transfer them to an imaging chamber.\nNote: The imaging chamber can be a magnetic imaging chamber (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B-f) or can be fabricated by mounting the coverslip onto a 35 mm petri dish with a hole in the middle of the bottom surface. The mounting can be done with biocompatible glue such as dental glue.\nTransfer the dishes under a biosafety cabinet, coat the coverslip with 10 μg/mL laminin diluted in sterile DPBS, incubate at 37°C for at least one hour.",
    "Rinse 2 times with DPBS and replace with 2 mL GSC medium and 40 μL of growth factor mix. The dishes are now ready for cell seeding.\nNote: Before coating (step m) micropatterned-coverslips can be stored at 4°C, face-up, in a dish sealed with parafilm for <1 week. After coating, we never store the dishes with DPBS, we recommend storing them in GSC medium at 37°C and seeding the cells within the next 24 hours.\nMaintenance of human glioma propagating cells (hGPCs)\nTiming: 30 min, every 5 days\nPatient-derived glioblastoma propagating cells are obtained from patient tumor samples and are not commercially available. Methods to initiate and propagate such lines from tumor tissues are well established (Gritti et al., 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Stringer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]). NNI-11, NNI-21 and NNI-24 cell lines analyzed in (Monzo et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]) were provided by the laboratory of Carol Tang (Singapore) (Chong et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Tan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]). The maintenance and expansion of these cells are described here. hGPCs are cultured in 6-cm dishes as tumor-spheres (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Every 5 days, spheres are triturated and passaged according to their growth rate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Before imaging or transfecting, cells are triturated and passaged on plates coated with laminin (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1588-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. hGPC maintenance and transfection\n(A) hGPC tumor-spheres as seen under the microscope (10× objective) after 5 days in culture.\n(B) hGPCs after trituration (no spheres are present).\n(C) hGPCs as a confluent monolayer grown on a laminin-coated dish.\n(D) Neon pipette and Neon tip.\n(E) Neon Electroporator setup.\n(F and G) hGPCS transfected with GFP control vector 24 h after electroporation (GFP channel and phase contrast). Scale bars are 100 μm.\nNote: The following steps should be conducted under a level 2 biosafety cabinet.",
    "Critical: hGPCs should be dissociated into single cells to ensure proper growth (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nEvaluate the density of the tumor-spheres at the microscope (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and transfer the content of the dish into a 15-mL tube.\nCentrifuge the sphere suspension at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate the supernatant, add 1 mL of GSC medium.\nTriturate by pipetting the suspension up and down 100 times with a P1000 pipetman set at 800 μL. After trituration, no sphere should remain (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: If a large number of spheres remain after trituration, we recommend further triturating by pipetting 20–30 times. Passage number recommended: 10–15 times.\nIn function of the cell growth rate, transfer between 1/20 to 1/3 of the cell suspension volume to a new 6-cm culture dish containing 4 mL of GSC medium and 80 μL of grow factor mix. Cells are also seeded on laminin-coated plates (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) for transfection and/or migration assay (see ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section for laminin coating).\nAfter 5 days, passage the cells again.\nhGPC transfection by electroporation\nTiming: 45 min\nhGPCs are detached from their plate and counted. One to two million cells are electroporated with 10 μg of DNA using the Neon™ Transfection System 100 μL Kit and subsequently re-plated on a laminin-coated dish (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D–3G). For transfection, we use purified DNA (QIAfilter Plasmid Maxi Kit - Qiagen) adjusted at a concentration of 1 μg/μL in milliQ water.\nNote: The following steps should be conducted under a level 2 biosafety cabinet.\nAspirate the medium and rinse the cells with DPBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL of trypsin/EDTA for a 6-cm dish and incubate for 2 min at 37°C.",
    "Note: incubation time may vary according to the cell line. To avoid any toxicity effect due to over-exposure to trypsin, we advise monitoring cell detachment under the microscope.\nInactivate the trypsin with 3.5 mL of GSC-BSA medium and transfer the cell suspension in a 15-mL tube.\nCritical: To neutralize trypsin, a serum-containing medium must be avoided to prevent hGPC differentiation. We use BSA to neutralize the trypsin but other means such as trypsin inhibitor could be used.\nTransfer 10 μL of cell suspension and count the cells in a cell counting chamber (or the volume necessary for the available cell counting machine).\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 200 × g.\nAspirate the supernatant, add 4 mL of DPBS to the cell pellet, and centrifuge for another 5 min at 200 × g.\nAspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet with buffer R (that is contained in Neon™ Transfection System 100 μL Kit) in order to obtain 1–2 × 106 cells / 100 μL.\nPlace the cuvette in the Neon electroporator and add 3.5 mL of buffer E2 (that is contained in Neon™ Transfection System 100 μL Kit).\nCritical: Make sure the cuvette “clicks” inside the slot in the Neon electroporator. Clicking means that all the electrical pads that provide the voltage pulse make contact correctly. Avoid wetting the electrical pads located between the cuvette and the Neon electroporator.\nAdd 12 μL of DNA to a 1.5 mL sterile Eppendorf tube, add 120 μL of the cell suspension in buffer R. The volume of buffer R has to be 10 times greater than the volume of DNA. Mix gently up and down the cells with the DNA. Avoid bubble formation as much as possible as it will prevent the conduction of the electroporating stimulus.",
    "Set the following parameters on the Neon electroporator. Voltage: 1,600 V, pulse duration: 20 ms, number of cycles: 1.\nNote: The optimization of the electroporator parameters might vary according to the cell line. We recommend a dedicated experiment to find the parameters that maximize transfection efficiency and cell viability. These settings correspond to the ones we used for the hGPC line NNI-21 (Monzo et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nWith the Neon pipette pick up the tip for electroporation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: We mix 120 μL buffer R + 12 μL of DNA to have an extra volume. This is to avoid bubble formation when we pipet the solution with the 100 μL-neon tip.\nTake 100 μL of cell suspension - DNA mixture and insert the Neon pipette along with the tip in the cuvette.\nHit “Run” on the Neon electroporator. The machine indicates if the electroporation occurred or if there is a connection problem. Also, at the time of the choc, bubbles can be observed at the level of the resistance.\nTransfer the electroporated cells directly to the 35-mm bacterial plate that was previously coated with laminin.\nNote: If cells are well adherent on the dish, it is advisable to change the medium after 6/8 hours from transfection. This helps to improve cell viability.\nThe day after, check the cells and change the medium. Cells can also be trypsinized and transferred to another dish. Cells can start expressing the construct within the next 6–8 h (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3G). For shRNA experiments, we typically wait 3 days after transfection to do the migratory experiment and the corresponding cell lysate for protein assay.",
    "Critical: For imaging and transfection, hGPCs are first cultured on a laminin dish. In fact, cells survive better after trypsinization than trituration which can lead to massive cell death. Also, this step allows a better estimation of the cell number upon counting.\nImaging, cell tracking, and measurement of mean speed and persistence\nTiming: 2 h\nFor migration assays (measure of speed and persistence), cells seeded on micropattern lines or grids are imaged in phase contrast using a 10× objective on a microscope equipped with temperature, humidity and CO2 control (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B). Acquisitions are typically obtained over a period of 12–24 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1588-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. hGPC imaging and manual tracking\n(A and B) Setup used for time-lapse acquisition.\n(C and D) Manual tracking plugin in ImageJ/Fiji and tracks. Bars are 100 μm.\n(E) Maximum intensity projection: the images of each slice of the timelapse are overlaid on top of each other with ImageJ: Image>Stack> Z-project>MAX intensity.\n(F) Resulting maximum intensity projection of the temporal stack of hGPCs migrating on the gridded micropattern over 7 h movie. Bar is 100 μm.\nCell seeding on micropatterns:\nAspirate the medium from the cells previously seeded on laminin, rinse once with DPBS and incubate cells with 500 μL of trypsin/EDTA for 1–5 min at 37°C.\nResuspend the cells with 3.5 mL of GSC-BSA medium to neutralize the trypsin and centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the cells in 4 mL of GSC medium.\nCount 10 μL of cells using a cell counting chamber.\nSeed 2,000–100,000 cells on the patterned dishes depending on the pattern and the size of the cells (we seed 2,000 cells on lines and 30,000 cells on grids with our NNI-21 with 1 cm2 patterned area).",
    "Incubate at 37°C for 3–4 h, then gently rinse with warmed medium to get rid of the floating cells before imaging.\nNote: The incubation time may be increased to 24–48 h depending on the cell’s ability to attach and the type of patterns.\nMigration assay:\nTurn on the microscope, camera, CO2 supply, the water pump and the heating unit at least 1 h before use. The heating unit temperature is set to 37°C. Set the 10× phase objective (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nPlace the imaging dishes in the plate holder and allow cells to stabilize for at least 30 min before recording (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nUsing the software interface, select the positions to record, adjust the focus using the camera, the exposure time, the light power, the time length of the acquisition, and the acquisition rate, and start imaging.\nNote: We use a Leica microscope with the dedicated software Leica Application Suite (LAS). Any microscope equipped with temperature, CO2 control, 10× phase objective, and an automated stage can be used. We typically image the cells at 1 image every 6 min for 12–20 h (overnight). Moreover, if cells were transfected with a fluorescent construct, the user should acquire the corresponding fluorescent channel to track the transfected cells.\nCell tracking (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C):\nOpen one imaging file with Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]).\nIn Plugins, go to tracking and manual tracking.\nNote: Because glioma cells can move in antiparallel streams, change shapes, and bump frequently in each other, automated tracking programs cannot be used to determine speed and persistence accurately. Cell bodies are manually tracked using the manual tracking plug-in of ImageJ/Fiji (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). The tracks are then pasted in Excel and calculations are made to extract the speed and persistence.\nIn the tracking window, hit the button “Add track”.",
    "Click on the cell to track: after each mouse click, the following image of the temporal stack is visualized until the last image is reached or the “End track” button is pressed.\nThe track files are then saved and opened in excel for analysis.\nNote: We usually track the first 6 hours of the movie, for statistical reasons and to avoid bias, we track all the cells that are present in the first frame of each movie. The following link gives detailed indications on how the manual tracking plugin works: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/track.html[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/track.html]. Moreover, in the case of transfected cells, double check with the fluorescent channel in order to be sure to track only cells that were successfully transfected.\nUnder “Image > Stack > Z project > MAX intensity” the maximum intensity projection of the temporal stack can be obtained (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E and 4F). It is a way to extrapolate qualitative phenotypes from motile cells, such as hurdling or gliding (Monzo et al., 2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nMeasurement of speed and persistence:\nTo extrapolate values of mean speed and persistence, we used 2 programs developed in (Gorelik and Gautreau, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) that can be integrated with Microsoft Excel.\nOpen a Microsoft Excel workbook and activate the Developer tab.
