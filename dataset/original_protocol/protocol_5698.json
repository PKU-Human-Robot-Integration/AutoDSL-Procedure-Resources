    "Cell collectionThis protocol is designed for use on ~2.5 x 108 cells or less (e.g., 50 ml of culture at 5 x 106 cells/ml density) of liquid cultures of C. zofingiensis. See Figure 1 for example.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180329/20180329232934_3098.jpgFigure 1. Liquid cultures of C. zofingiensis. An example of liquid cultures of C. zofingiensis (SAG 211-14) suitable as input for this protocol. Here, cells were grown in Proteose medium (UTEX Culture Collection of Algae) supplemented with Chu’s medium (2 ml/L, UTEX Culture Collection of Algae) as described previously (Roth et al., 2017). The cultures were grown at 25 °C with shaking at 100-150 rpm in diurnal (16 h light, 8 h dark) conditions with a light intensity of 90-100 μmol photons m-2 sec-1. Transfer cell culture to a 50 ml Falcon tube. Spin for 5 min at 3,200 x g (RCF) at 4 °C. Immediately after the centrifuge comes to a stop, quickly remove the supernatant by decanting into a waste receptacle.Flash freeze tubes containing cell pellet in liquid N2.Optional: Store samples at -80 °C before further processing.PreparationPrepare glassware and metalware including spatula by washing with detergent and baking at 180 °C for 8 h.Clean bench and pipettes with RNaseZap or equivalent.Prepare fresh lysis buffer (see Recipes) just prior to starting according to the recipe.Pre-cool microfuge, centrifuge and buckets to 4 °C.Prepare buckets with crushed wet ice.Prepare buckets with crushed dry ice.Chill 100% EtOH on dry ice.Label Lysing Matrix D tubes and place on dry ice. Cell lysis and RNA purificationTransfer frozen sample tubes to the dry ice bucket. Take a clean, RNase-free spatula and thrust it up and down into the tube to break up the cell pellet. The tube should remain on dry ice during the process so that the cells remain frozen and prevent RNA degradation.",
    "Pipette 1 ml of cold 100% EtOH into the tube. Transfer the cell mass with spatula and EtOH with a pipette into a chilled Lysing Matrix D 2 ml tube.Spin for 3 min at 2,700 x g (RCF) at 4 °C. Decant supernatant.Place crushed dry ice in the homogenizer tray, transfer tubes to the homogenizer, and run for 60 sec at 6.0 m/sec. Repeat for an additional 60 sec.Add 1 ml of freshly prepared lysis buffer to the cell mass.Vortex for ~30 sec.Incubate for 3 min at RT.Spin for 3 min at 20,800 x g (RCF) at RT.Spin MaXtract tubes for 2 min at 1,500 x g (RCF) at RT.Add 10 ml of TRIzol to the MaXtract tube.Transfer 1 ml of supernatant to the MaXtract tube with TRIzol.Incubate for 3 min at RT.Add 2 ml of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and shake vigorously for 30 sec. Incubate for 5 min at RT.Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,500 x g (RCF) at RT. Add 10 ml of cold 100% EtOH to a labeled 50 ml conical tube for each sample.Decant the aqueous phase of the MaXtract tube (~6-7 ml) into the 50 ml conical tube with EtOH.Invert the tube several times to mix, and then place on wet ice. Working with one sample at a time, while the others remain on ice:Turn on the vacuum. Place a QIAGEN miRNeasy mini-column on the vacuum manifold with a fresh VacConnector. Using a 10 ml serological pipette, load the lysate/EtOH mixture onto the miRNeasy mini column until all liquid has passed through the membrane.Close vacuum and place column back in its 2 ml collection tube and put on ice. Put column back on vacuum manifold and add 350 µl QIAGEN buffer RWT. Open vacuum until all buffer has passed through the column.",
    "Return the column to the collection tube.Just prior to using, prepare fresh DNase solution from the QIAGEN RNase-free DNase Set. Combine sufficient DNase (10 µl per column) and QIAGEN buffer RDD (70 µl per column) for all samples. Mix gently by inverting the tube 3-4 times. Note: Do NOT vortex the DNase!Add 80 µl DNase/RDD mixture from the previous step to each column.Incubate tubes for 15 min in a 30 °C heat block.Place columns back on the vacuum manifold.Add 350 µl QIAGEN buffer RWT to each column.Open vacuum until all RWT buffer has passed through the columns. Wash columns with QIAGEN buffer RPE buffer twice as follows:Add 500 µl of RPE to each column.Close the lid and rotate the column gently to rinse the walls of the column.Place columns back on the vacuum manifold.Open vacuum until all RPE buffer has passed through the columns.Repeat.Carefully remove the column from the collection tube to avoid carryover of ethanol and place it in a new 2 ml collection tube.Spin for 1 min at maximum speed (≥ 10,000 x g (RCF)) at RT.Place the column in a new, labeled 1.5 ml collection tube.Add 50 µl RNase-free dH2O directly to the spin column membrane.Spin for 1 min at maximum speed (≥ 10,000 x g (RCF)) at RT to elute the RNA.Repeat with an additional 50 µl RNase-free dH2O (~90 µl eluate in total).Add 270 µl RNase-free dH2O.Add 40 µl 3 M NaOAc at pH 8. Recap and invert the tube to mix.Add 1,000 µl ice-cold 100% EtOH. Recap and invert the tube to mix.Incubate for 30 min at -20 °C.Spin for 30 min at 4 °C at maximum speed (≥ 10,000 x g (RCF)).Without disturbing the pellet, gently decant supernatant.Wash with 500 µl RT 70% EtOH. Without disturbing the pellet, gently decant supernatant.",
    "Remove remaining liquid with a Pipetman.Air dry the pellet for 5-10 min at RT.Resuspend the pellet in 60 µl RNase-free dH2O.Quality controlDetermine the optical absorbance by NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Use 1 µl of dH2O to blank the NanoDrop.Determine the optical absorbance at 260, 230, and 280 nm for 1 µl of each sample. Assay the RNA quality by microfluidic electrophoresis on a Bioanalyzer.Dilute 1 µl of each sample with 9 µl of RNase-free water. Following the manufacturer’s protocol, load 1 µl of the 10x diluted RNA into a well of an RNA 6000 Nano chip and assay with the Eukaryote total RNA program. Note: Alternatively, an Agilent Tape Station may be used."
