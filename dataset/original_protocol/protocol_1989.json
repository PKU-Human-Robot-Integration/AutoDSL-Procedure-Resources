In this protocol, glass microchips are used for their good reusability. Microchips made from other materials, including polycarbonate, polymethylmethacrylate, polydimethylsiloxane can potentially be used too.\nDesigning mask. Use AutoCAD or similar software to draw the Y-shape droplet microfluidic chip and droplet counting microwell chip pattern (for the use of AutoCAD, please refer to http://www.cadtutor.net/tutorials/autocad/index.php[href=http://www.cadtutor.net/tutorials/autocad/index.php]), order the photolithography mask with the designed pattern from an available commercial supplier (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1587-Mmc1.zip] and S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1587-Mmc2.zip]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1587-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mask design of microfluidic chips\n(A) The Y-shape droplet microfluidic chip (Notes: The two oil inlets can be merged into one).\n(B) The droplet counting microwell chip.\nFabricating microfluidic chips. The fabrication of the designed microfluidic chips followed well-developed and described protocols (Golozar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Jia et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Overall, it includes photoresist developing, mask exposing, selective chromium removal, glass etching, and chip bonding (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]).\nNote: It is critical to remove any bubbles that may form when bonding the chip.\nHydrophobic treatment. Infiltrate the Y-shape droplet microfluidic chip and droplet counting microwell chip channel with 0.1% (v/v) perfluorododecyltrichlorosilane (FTCS) solution in dry toluene for 5 min (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).\nCritical: Wearing appropriate protective clothing and equipment when handling highly toxic and moisture-sensitive FTCS solution and use only in a fume hood.\nAlternatives: The hydrophobic modification on the glass substrate microfluidic chip can be carried out by plasma technology.\nWashing. Flush the microfluidic channels with pure HFE-7500 fluorinated oil to remove unreacted silanes and flush each module with pressurized air or nitrogen. The chips are ready for experimental use.",
    "Critical: The chip can be stored for weeks or months at 20°C–25°C before use. To prevent degradation of the treated surface, avoid direct sunlight. The chip surface should be covered with Scottish tape to prevent dust.\nStandard multiplexed LAMP reaction\nTiming: 120 min\nThe multiplexed LAMP reaction procedure is demonstrated by simultaneously detecting HCV and HIV plasmids, in which HCV and HIV templates were cloned into empty pUC57 vectors, and an appropriate primer design is shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nNote: When designing the primers for LAMP assays, perform specificity analysis with BLAST to find the specific sequences for the multiple targets of interest.\nHCV and HIV plasmids are heated to 95°C for 5 min and then cooled with an ice/water mixture for at least 20 min before use.\nNote: Such quenching can open DNA double helix structure, resulting in better hybridization with primers.\nPrepare the master mix for LAMP reaction in a microcentrifuge tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1587_2.csv\nPrepare freshly before use.\nNote: Due to volume loss during pipetting, a master mix solution allowing for 2–3 additional reactions is suggested.\nCritical: Preparing and maintaining the master mix on ice boxes is recommended to avoid enzyme activity decreasing and nonspecific product amplification.\nAdd 1 μL HCV plasmid, 1 μL HIV plasmid, and 23 μL LAMP master mix to a respective PCR 8-Tube strip and gently mix by pipetting 7–10 times.\nNote: A no template control (NTC) should be used (nuclease-free H2O only as sample) to indicate false-positive results due to contamination of reagents or work area (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]).\nCritical: Be careful not to form bubbles while mixing.\nSpin PCR 8-Tube Strip tubes lightly in a Benchtop centrifuge at 2,000 × g for roughly 10 s.",
    "Run the LAMP reaction at a set temperature using a C1000 Thermal Cycler with a CFX96 detection system. Monitor the real-time fluorescence intensity in ROX and Cy5 channels at intervals of 30 s for 100 cycles (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7]).\nNote: Firstly, when developing a new multiplexed LAMP assay, optimize the LAMP reaction temperature by performing parallel experiments at different temperatures (the optimized temperature gives the minimum Ct value). For this assay, the optimized reaction temperature is 64°C.\nSecondly, ROX channel and Cy5 channel indicate HCV and HIV in the experiment, respectively. Combinations of other fluorophores are also feasible (Ball et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Becherer et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Jiang et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Varona and Anderson, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). For more combinations, use the PrimeTime Multiplex Dye Selection Tool from Integrated DNA Technologies. In addition, make sure the selected combinations are compatible with the fluorescence microscope to be used.\nGel electrophoresis of LAMP products\nTiming: 120 min\nTo further confirm the success of the LAMP reaction, gel electrophoresis is recommended.\nHeat the reaction products to 80°C for 20 min to stop the reaction by denaturing the polymerase.\nNote: After the run is completed, reaction products can be stored at −20°C for up to several weeks.\nAnalyze the LAMP products with agarose gel electrophoresis. 3% agarose gel is used, gel electrophoresis is carried out in 0.5 × TBE electrophoresis buffer, gels are stained with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide and 0.5 μg/mL Goldview. Gels are visualized with Tanon 4200SF gel imaging system (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1587-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Image of droplet generation (top) and counting microwell (bottom) chips\nCritical: Firstly, be careful when using ethidium bromide. Gloves should be worn during preparation and use. Secondly, gel electrophoresis is a common cause of contamination. It is recommended to perform this experiment in an independent lab.",
    "Alternatives: Other gel stains can also be used (e.g., 4S GelRed, Sangon Biotech, Cat #A616697-0100; SYBR™ Safe DNA Gel Stain, Invitrogen™, Cat #S33102).\nMultiplexed dLAMP reaction\nTiming: 120 min\nApply the multiplexed dLAMP platform to detect HCV and HIV.\nClean the microfluidic chips with Kimwipes and ethanol to remove dust and particles.\nNote: The dLAMP experiment is best carried out in a dust-free laboratory to avoid any potential chip contamination and for the purpose of chip reuses.\nPrepare two sterile 1-mL syringes to inject continuous phase consisting of fluorinated oil Novec-7500 containing 1% (wt/wt) Pico-SurfTM fluorinated surfactant.\nCritical: Filtration of the prepared oil phase with polyethersulfone membranes or cellulose acetate membranes with a membrane pore size of 0.1/0.2 μm is recommended.\nNote: The surfactant acts as an interface stabilization agent that stabilizes the droplets under a wide range of temperature and biological conditions, as well as allowing droplets to be stored for several weeks in suitable conditions. The optimal surfactant concentration needs to be determined to allow the stable formation of droplets during the whole experiment (Baret, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPrepare the multiplexed dLAMP reaction master mix A in a microcentrifuge tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1587_3.csv\nStore at 4°C for up to 1 week.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1587_4.csv\nPrepare freshly before use.\nPrepare the multiplexed dLAMP reaction master mix B in another microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: Optionally, BSA (0.2 mg/mL) can be added to the reaction solution to lessen the enzyme loss during pipetting and transferring, and to stabilize the enzyme in reaction.\nUse two 1-mL disposable sterile syringes (26 gauge) to inject dLAMP reaction master mix A and B, separately.\nNote: The syringes need to match the PEEK adapters.",
    "Connect the syringes to the corresponding entrances of the Y-shape droplet microfluidic chip through PTFE microtubes (1/16 in. OD × 0.01 in. ID), and PEEK adapters (1/16 in. OD). The injection flow rates are set to 10 μL/min for oil phases and 3 μL/min for aqueous phases during droplet generation.\nNote: The injection flow rates of oil and water phases are determined according to the structure of the chip.\nConnect the droplet generation chip exit to the droplet counting microwell chip with a PTFE microtube, and PEEK adapters to collect the generated droplets (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1587-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Gel images of LAMP reaction products\nLane M: Marker; lane 1: blank; lane 2:HeLa cell genomic DNA; lane 3: HCV template; lane 4: cDNA from HCV-infected sample; lane 5: HIV template; lane 6: cDNA from HIV-infected sample.\nNote: Linear connectors can be used to connect and fix the chip to minimize the experimental vibration, as it provides a straight-through flow path from the chip to the tube, which is beneficial for droplet collection.\nObserve the flow junction of the droplet generation chip under a microscope with a 10 × objective. Purge off air from the chip with buffer solution, wait until droplet generation stabilizes, then collect the droplets (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9]).\nObserve the collection chip to monitor the droplet generation process. Droplets should be round with uniform diameters (∼50 μm) and monodispersed in the chamber (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.11]).\nNote: Ensure that sufficient oil exists below the emulsion to prevent droplet evaporation and drying (troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.13]).\nWhen the droplet counting microwell chip is full of monodisperse droplets, detach it from the droplet generation chip, and connect a new droplet counting microwell chip to the droplet generation chip exit to start collecting droplets for another sample.",
    "Note: The collection chamber can collect about 61,000 droplets, the active collection time is about 40 s. To avoid sample cross-interference, use a new injector when injecting a different sample and discard the droplets generated in the first two minutes. This process also allows the droplet generation of the new sample to be stabilized. The typical collection time for one sample is about 3 min. After collecting the droplets, place the droplet counting microwell chips in a thermostat water bath (64°C) for 60 min to allow the LAMP reaction to occur.\nCritical: To prevent the loss of droplets and avoid water entering the chip during water bath incubation, use tape to seal the droplet counting microwell chips.\nNote: Optimize the dLAMP reaction time to allow the stabilization of fluorescent droplet generation. For this assay, the optimized reaction time is 60 min.\nAfter the LAMP reaction, take out the droplet counting microwell chips, wipe the water on the surface off the chip, and analyze them with microscopic imaging.\nDroplet counting by fluorescence imaging\nTiming: 120 min\nAcquire fluorescence images of the entire microwells using an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope under 10× objective.\nPreparing. Place the droplet counting microwell chip on the microscope counter. Open the imaging software and select appropriate scan modes.\nNote: Nikon Inverted Eclipse Ti epifluorescence microscope equipped with a motorized XY stage (Nikon), a CoolLed pE-4000 illumination source, a Nikon DS-Qi2 camera, and an apochromatic 10× objective (numerical aperture, 0.45) (Nikon) is used here.\nFocusing. Adjust the microscope so that the droplets can be clearly observed through eyepieces.\nNote: The average droplet diameter is around 50 μm. 10× objective is recommended for observation and image scanning.",
    "Setting up. Setup image acquisition parameters for 488 (FITC), 560 (TAMRA), and 640 (Cy5) channels. Optimize imaging parameters until the positive droplets are brightly fluoresced under observation (troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.15]). Save the parameters for later use (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1587-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Fluorescence images and intensity profiles of droplets in different channels\nScale bar: 200 μm.\nImaging. To image all droplets, use the large image scan function. The microscope will automatically scan the defined region and combine them into a large image (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). The scan parameters are as follows: pixel size is 2.49 μm, optical resolution is 0.78 μm, scan size is 512 × 512 pixels, and dwell time is 2.2 μs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1587-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Whole-area images of droplet counting microwell chip\nTop: FITC channel, bottom: bright-field channel.\nNote: Set the scan area according to the size of the microwell. It takes about 10 min to scan for one large image. In addition, the scanning time depends on the selected scanning parameters of the microscope.\nSaving. Save the scanned large image and image other samples under the same microscopy parameters (troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.17]).\nCleaning. Clean the chips after all the sample scans are finished. To reuse the microchips, inject isopropanol to clean the chips, then incubate with 2 U/μL DNase I at 37°C for 8–12 h to degrade residual oligonucleotides.\nNote: Clean the droplet counting microwell chip and Y-shape droplet microfluidic chip in a fume hood to avoid aerosol pollution.\nDroplet analysis\nTiming: 120 min\nAnalyze the pictures and count positive droplets with NIS-Element software (or other image analysis software, i.e., ImageJ), calculate the template copies according to the Poisson distribution.\nOpen the images in NIS-Element software.",
    "Click tool bar, choose View > Analysis Controls > Automated Measurement > Thresholding > Per channel. Properly define the values of fluorescence intensity threshold, droplet size ranges, circularity and so on. After automated analysis, positive droplets are selected and counted (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). Proper parameter settings are critical for droplet counting results.\nFor the fluorescence intensity threshold, set the threshold for 488 channel above the fluorescence intensity of non-droplet background to ensure counting all droplets, set the threshold for 560/640 channels above the fluorescence intensity of non-fluorescent droplets to ensure counting only positive droplets.\nNote: Adjust the threshold range to ensure correct counting of droplets.\nFor the droplet size, convert the droplet diameter (∼ 50 μm) into image pixels, define the min/max value as 10/60 μm of the mean droplet diameter.\nNote: Set the min diameter to be 10 μm to ensure counting droplets around the edge of the photographs.\nFour basic operations can be performed on the binary layer before droplet counting. Use ‘Clean’ to remove small objects from the binary image, ‘Smooth’ to smooth the binary image contours, ‘Fill Holes’ to fill holes within binary objects, ‘Separate’ to separate objects.\nNote: These operations help improve the image analysis process of droplets. Perform corresponding operations if needed.\nThe number of counted droplets can be obtained from View > Analysis Controls > Automated Measurement Results. Save and export the data for future analysis (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1587-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

    "Calculate the copy number of targets following the Poisson distribution equation: m = n × ln [1/ (1-p)], where p is the percentage of positive droplets, and n is the total number of droplets (Heyries et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Hindson et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nMultiplexed dLAMP evaluation (versus qPCR)\nTiming: 24 h\nWe recommend a parallel comparison of the developed multiplexed dLAMP versus the gold standard qPCR. Plasma samples are used here to evaluate the HCV/HIV dLAMP assay.\nFollow the manufacturer’s protocol of QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=8798cda6-4c55-4c0e-a302-966521c81aec&lang=en] to extract HCV and HIV RNA.\nPause point: Extracted/purified RNA samples can be stored at −80°C for long-term storage.\nReverse transcript HCV and HIV RNA into cDNAs according to the instruction of the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/cn/resources/resourcedetail?id=a7889bfb-cb1b-4e23-a538-9e4f20fdca91&lang=en].\nPause point: cDNA standards can be stored at −20°C for up to 1 week.\nDissolve cDNA samples in 2 mL ddH2O and divide them into two equal-volume portions. One portion will be subjected to qPCR analysis, and the other will be subjected to previously described multiplexed dLAMP assay.\nPrepare the multiplexed qPCR reaction master mix in a microcentrifuge tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1587_5.csv\nStore at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nPerform the PCR in an ABI StepOnePlus qPCR thermal cycler by using the following program. And the cDNA concentrations are determined from the standard curves plotted using the synthetic templates.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1587_6.csv\nUse the other portion for multiplexed dLAMP analysis.\nCompare results obtained from qPCR and dLAMP to evaluate the performance of the developed dLAMP assay.\nAlternatives: For RT-PCR, qPCR, and LAMP reaction, the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher, Cat #4485701) and Mastercycler nexus X2 (Eppendorf, Cat #6336000023) are suggested alternatives."
