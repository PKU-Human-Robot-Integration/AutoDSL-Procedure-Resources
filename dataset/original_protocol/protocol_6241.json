    "Surgical preparationSterilize all equipment and place drape over circulating water heated pad to maintain sterile field and keep animal warm through the duration of the surgery. Water is circulated by a water pump with temperature controls.Thaw aliquots of thrombin, fibrinogen, and fibronectin to room temperature. Fibrinogen will begin to coagulate independently if left at room temperature for too long, so ensure there is minimal time between thawing and surgery.Note: We have successfully used these up to 6 h after thawing. Weigh the animal and prepare a fresh dose of buprenorphine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally prior to anesthetic induction.Induce anesthesia by placing the animal in the isoflurane box (approximately 4% isoflurane in 100% oxygen) for approximately 4 min.The mouse is then placed on a nose cone, in a separate area to prep the leg. Remove hair on the dorsal hindlimb (ankle to hip) using electric clippers and/or Nair. Apply eye ointment with a sterile cotton applicator.Wipe the surgical area with alcohol and iodine wipes three times in succession (rubbing from middle to edges of limb).Confirm a surgical plane of anesthesia by applying pressure to hindpaw with forceps (toe pinch). Wait to proceed until there is no response.Surgery (the entire procedure is performed under a stereo dissecting microscope)The animal is then moved into the surgical field and placed on a nose-cone to supply isoflurane anesthesia for the remainder of the surgery. Secure hindlimb in extended position with surgical tape (Figure 1). In this example we are using the left leg, however the same procedure can be performed on the right leg or in both.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916182251_8984.jpgFigure 1.

    "Black dashed line outlines the location of the sciatic nerve (located medial to the femur). Palpate the skin to identify the femur, then move 2 mm medial and make a small incision (< 2 cm) in the skin with a fine scalpel (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916182322_3354.jpgFigure 2. Incision. A small incision was made through the skin just over the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve can be seen through the biceps femoris muscle (arrow). The sciatic is just lateral the femur bone. Medial to the nerve there is a blood vessel that runs parallel. Once the biceps muscle is retracted the sciatic nerve will be obvious as it is the largest nerve in the hind limb.Blunt dissect muscle (biceps femoris) at mid-thigh using extra fine Bonn scissors (FST catalog number 14084-08), exposing the sciatic nerve. A retractor may be used to ensure adequate visibility, but is not necessary during a typical surgery. Carefully isolate the nerve from connective tissue (Figure 3). The nerve is carefully isolated using a pair of #5 forceps.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916182438_6738.jpgFigure 3. Exposure of the sciatic nerve. The biceps femoris was blunt dissected and a pair of retractors inserted to separate skin and muscle over the sciatic nerve.Place a small (~4 mm x 4 mm square) of SILASTIC film below the sciatic nerve (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916182513_3411.jpgFigure 4. SILASTIC platform. A small piece of SILASTIC matting was placed under the sciatic nerve.Cut sciatic nerve with sharp microscissors, leaving the film intact (Figure 5). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916182647_9497.jpgFigure 5. Nerve Injury. The sciatic nerve was completely transected with small surgical scissors, leaving both stumps on the SILASTIC mat.Quickly mix fibrinogen/fibronectin/thrombin in a 1:1:2 ratio on a smooth, sterile surface, using fresh tips each time. We recommend mixing in this order for consistency. Place approximately 10 μl mixture quickly on sciatic nerve over SILASTIC film (Figure 6).",
    "Wait until glue becomes tacky (usually ~2 min) prior to next steps. Note: Here we placed 20 μl for demonstration purposes, however 10 μl is sufficient for securing the nerve stumps together. If the nerve stumps are not both covered in glue then more may need to be added, though this is unlikely. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916182736_7211.jpgFigure 6. Nerve repair. The sciatic nerve was then glued back together using a cocktail containing fibrinogen (2 mg/ml), fibronectin (25 mg/ml), and thrombin (12.5 Units/ml). Ensure there is no excess bleeding and close the wound in layers, with loose sutures through the belly of the muscle and tight sutures through the skin (Figures 7 and 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916182753_4097.jpgFigure 7. Muscle closure. The biceps femoris muscle is sutured back together using absorbable suture. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916182837_1795.jpgFigure 8. Skin closure. The skin is realigned and sutured back together using absorbable suture.Note: One can also use wound clips for the step.Surgery CompletionRemove the mouse from isoflurane and keep on heating pad until mouse becomes conscious and moves freely.  Following this procedure the nerve is repaired and there is continuity between proximal and distal stumps (Figure 9). Axons successfully traverse the gap between the cut stumps and ultimately reconnect and reinnervate muscle within an 8-week period (Willherm et al., 2012; Rotterman et al., 2019).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916182909_4353.jpgFigure 9. Nerve repair 8 weeks post injury. These images show a successful nerve repair 8 weeks after injury in a mouse perfused with paraformaldehyde fixative. The nerve was completely reformed at this time point and the axons re-innervated muscles in the lower hindlimb."
