    "This protocol describes the reagents and steps to generate a single batch of high-titer third-generation lentivirus based on ultracentrifuge rotor volume capacity. Prior to lentivirus production, the HEK293T/17 cells must be expanded to ensure a sufficient quantity of cells for transfection on day 1 (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-fig-0001]). For this, HEK cells are seeded into three T175 flasks on day -2 and expanded for 3 days. Transfection is performed in the morning of day 1 using the Lipofectamine 3000 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by a medium change 6 hr later. Two lentivirus harvests are conducted, on day 2 (24 hr post-transfection) and day 3 (52 hr post-transfection), to coincide with maximal gene expression and lentivirus production by HEK cells (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-fig-0001]).

    "24. Fifty-two hours post-transfection, Collect all lentiviral supernatant from dishes and transfer into 50-ml conical tubes.\n25. Centrifuge 10 min at 2000 × g, 4°C.\n26. Combine all lentivirus supernatants (from Harvest 1/step 23 and Harvest 2/step 25) into a 500-ml 0.45-µm Stericup filter. Filter lentivirus supernatant with a vacuum pump or pipettor.\nThe total volume should be ∼220 ml.\n27. Place filtered supernatant in the Stericup on ice.\nUltracentrifugation\n28. Transfer 30 ml filtered lentivirus supernatant into each pre-chilled UC tube (six tubes total).\n29. Slowly add 2 ml cold sucrose cushion solution directly to base of three UC tubes using a 10-ml plastic pipet filled containing 8 ml cold sucrose cushion solution (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-fig-0002]). After filling the first three UC tubes, use a new 10-ml plastic pipet to repeat this for the remaining three tubes.\nTo produce a dense, discontinuous sucrose cushion without bubbles, the viscous solution must be pipetted slowly and with a volume in the pipet that remains above the KSR medium to prevent backflow of the lentivirus supernatant into the pipet.

Ultracentrifuge lentiviral supernatants for 90 min at 91,000 × g, 4°C.\n35. Remove rotor and buckets. Immediately pour contents of each UC tube into a waste container and then place each tube upside-down on clean paper towels.\nA small pellet containing virus particles may be visible at the base of each tube.\n36. Quickly remove excess supernatant from the UC tube walls using clean Kimwipes or equivalent. Repeat.\n37. Add 80 μl cold PBS to each UC tube. Place UC tubes on ice.\nLentivirus particles should remain chilled henceforth.\n38. Working quickly with one UC tube at a time, carefully resuspend virus pellet in the PBS using a pipet.\nViral pellets may be difficult to see. To ensure resuspension, repeatedly pipet the PBS up and down along the inner surface of the tube base in an attempt to wash adhered viral particles off the surface. Avoid creating bubbles, as these may shear the virus particles.\n39. Transfer lentivirus supernatant from each UC tube into a single 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and place on ice.\nThe total lentivirus particle volume should be ∼600 μl, and the expected titer will be in the range of 1 × 108 to 1 × 109. To further concentrate the lentivirus, a second ultracentrifugation can be performed (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-prot-0002]). The expected titer after a second ultracentrifugation will be in the range of 1 × 109 to 1 × 1010.\n40. Aliquot small volumes of lentivirus supernatant into separate labeled 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and place immediately on dry ice. Store lentivirus aliquots ≤1 year at −80°C.",
    "Lentivirus stocks are recommended to be used within 1 year because longer storage may reduce transduction efficiency. It is recommended to aliquot the lentivirus into small volumes (e.g., 10 μl) to avoid repeated freeze-thaw of lentivirus, which can also reduce transduction efficiency.",
    "A second ultracentrifugation step may be performed with the purified lentivirus from step 39 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-prot-0001] to further concentrate the lentiviral particles. This may be necessary if the initial titer is predicted to be below expectations due to large transfer plasmid size or where an extremely high titer and low viral volumes are optimal, such as for in vivo applications.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-prot-0001])\nLentivirus particle supernatant (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-prot-0001], step 39)\nUC tubes: 13.5-ml, 16 × 76–mm, thin-walled, open-top polypropylene ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. 326814)\nSW 41 Ti swinging-bucket rotor (six 13.2-ml buckets; Beckman Coulter, cat. no. 331362) or as specified for ultracentrifuge, 4°C\n1.

Carefully add 0.5 ml sucrose cushion solution to base of the tube using a 2-ml pipet tip.\n3. Prepare a second UC tube with equal weights of KSR medium and PBS as a balance.\n4. Transfer the two UC tubes into two rotor buckets.\n5. Top up UC tubes to ∼12.8 ml with KSR medium or PBS. Screw lid tightly onto each bucket.\n6. Ensure that all six buckets are hooked into pre-chilled rotor (SW 41 Ti swinging-bucket rotor or as specified for the ultracentrifuge), with the two filled buckets placed opposite to each other.\n7.

    "This protocol describes the steps to titer the lentivirus manufactured in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-prot-0001] or the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-prot-0002]. The method involves a serial dilution of the lentivirus stock and transduction of HEK293T/17 cells to generate a standard curve of concentrations. A total of 16 to 18 hr prior to transduction, the HEK cells are seeded onto six-well tissue culture plates at a relatively low density to maximize transduction efficiency. The following morning, separate wells of HEK cells are transduced with different concentrations of lentivirus from the serial dilution. The transduced HEK cells are incubated for 48 hr to ensure gene expression, and then the concentration is analyzed.\nThe concentration (transduction efficiency) of the lentivirus is determined using a functional titration method. Here, for functional assessment, the lentivirus of interest needs to contain a fluorescent reporter (e.g., GFP) that is used to calculate the relative proportion of transduced cells by manual counting. This method requires use of a fluorescent microscope equipped with a camera. Imaging analysis software, such as the freeware ImageJ (see Internet Resources), is recommended to assist with manual counting and to minimize human error. Alternatively, FACS analysis (Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-prot-0004]) can be performed using a lentivirus containing a fluorescent reporter (e.g., GFP), or qPCR analysis can be conducted to assess the relative lentivirus copy number compared to a control lentivirus of known concentration (Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-prot-0005]).\nMaterials\nHEK293T/17 cells (ATCC, cat. no.

Keep remaining well with no virus as a negative control (0 μl).\nThe result will be five wells containing 1 μl of 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, or 0.01 dilution of the virus stock.\n5. Incubate for 48 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nThose interested in using FACS or qPCR for the titration analysis, instead of the manual counting approach described here (see steps 6 to 8), would now continue with Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-prot-0004] or 2, respectively.\n6. Capture a minimum of four randomized images per well with an upright fluorescent microscope equipped with a camera using appropriate excitation/emission filters at 20× magnification (emission of ∼512-µm width).\nImages should be representative of the transduction efficiency in each condition. Record both brightfield and fluorescent images.\n7. Perform total and fluorescent cell counts using brightfield and fluorescent images, respectively (see Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.125#cpmb125-fig-0004]).",

Representative triplicate Cq values for the LV2 and albumin genes are averaged to calculate the Cq mean for a serial dilution of lentivirus of known (A) or unknown (B) titration. A delta (Δ) Cq is calculated by subtracting the LV2 Cq mean from the albumin Cq mean. The Cq mean values for the lentivirus of known (C) and unknown (D) titration are plotted on an XY graph against dilution value. A natural log regression analysis is performed, and the unknown variables are used to calculate the unknown lentivirus titer. The letters (T-W, Z) denote variables to be solved using the formula."
