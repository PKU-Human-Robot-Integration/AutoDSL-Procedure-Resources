    "1. Microfabrication\nNOTE: All the microfabrication procedures are performed in a cleanroom. A chrome mask is designed prior to the microfabrication, see Figure 2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55106/55106fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Schematic of the channel design in the microfluidic chip and the dimensions of the working units. a) Mask design of the aligned PDMS microchannels (green) and the patterns on the glass substrate (blue and red). b) Enlarged image of the mask design in a representative section of the working unit arrays. c) Schematic of one working unit showing a cell pattern (blue) and a pair of gold dots (red).

A schematic diagram for the gold dot fabrication is shown in Figure 3a.\n\t\nGlass slide cleaning (in a chemical hood)\nFlush the glass slide with acetone followed by isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and then dry it with N2 flow.\nSoak the slide in piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2 = 4:1) for 10 min.\nTake out the slide, rinse it with DI water, and then dry it with N2 flow.\nBake the glass slide on a hotplate at 120 °C for 10 min.\nTreat the slide in a plasma asher at 100 W for 90 s.\nSpin-coating (spin-coating hood)\nTurn on a hotplate and wait until the temperature is stable at 95 °C.\nFollow the coating procedure:\n\t\t\t1,000 rpm for 5 s with a 500-rpm/s ramp;\n\t\t\tthen 3,000 rpm for 30 s with a 1,000-rpm/s ramp.",
    "Fix the cleaned glass slide onto the spin coater by applying a vacuum.\nCover the slide surface with P-20 and start the coating recipe.\nRepeat the coating process for NFR-negative photoresist.\nBake the slide at 95 °C for 60 s and wait until it cools down to room temperature.\nPhotolithography\nMount the chrome mask onto the mask aligner and make sure that the pattern side is facing down towards the slide.\nSet the photolithography recipe to hard exposure mode with 9 s of UV exposure and quickly align the glass substrate with the mask.\nAfter carrying out the UV exposure, bake the slide at 95 °C for 1 min, and then let it cool down to room temperature.\nDevelopment\nDevelop the pattern on the slide in developer solution for 60 s.\nRemove the slide from the developer, flush it with DI water, and dry it with N2 flow.\nCheck the pattern geometry under a microscope, and measure and record the feature size.\nGold deposition (E-beam evaporation) and lift-off\nBake the slide at 120 °C for 5 min, and let it cool down to room temperature.\nClean the slide with plasma in the reactive ion etching (RIE) machine for 90 s at 500 Torr and 100 W.\nDeposit 5 nm of Ti and 15 nm of Au onto the slide using an E-beam evaporator17.\nSoak the slide overnight in a glass beaker containing photoresist remover solvent to remove the gold resting on top of the NFR resist.\nRetrieve the slide, flush it with acetone followed by IPA, and dry it with N2 flow.\nDry the slide on a hot plate at 115 °C before cleaning it in the oxygen plasma asher at 100 W for 90 s.\nMolecular-assembly patterning by lift-off (MAPL)",
    "Note: The area of each fibronectin-coated island is set to be within 700-900 µm2 to facilitate adequate HeLa cell spreading in a square region while minimizing the chances of multiple cells aggregating on the island. A schematic diagram for the preparation of cell-patterning islands is shown in Figure 3b.\n\t\nSpin coating\nRepeat step 1.1.2, but use S1813-positive photoresist and a temperature of 115 °C.\nAligned photolithography\nMount the chrome mask onto the mask aligner and make sure that the side with the pattern is facing down towards the slide with the gold dots.\nSet the photolithography recipe to hard exposure mode with 9 s of UV exposure.\nAlign the top mask with the bottom slide using alignment marks, located around the edge of the mask, as a spatial reference.\nCheck the central portion of the mask and verify that the pattern features are aligned correctly.\nComplete the UV exposure without a post-bake.\nDevelopment\nRepeat step 1.1.3 but with 45 s of development before drying on a hotplate and preserving in N2 storage.\nChemical treatment\nPrepare the passivating solution: 0.5 mg/mL PLL-g-PEG in 10 mM HEPES buffer.\nRetrieve the slide from N2 storage and clean it using RIE with the parameter setting: 500-Torr pressure, 100-W power, and 90-s duration.\nPipette one drop of passivating solution onto a piece of paraffin film.\nSandwich the solution with the film and the slide, making sure that the side with the pattern features is facing down towards the film; avoid the formation of bubbles.\nWait for 45 min before removing the slide from the film.\nSoak the slide consecutively in photoresist remover, photoresist remover and DI water (1:1), and DI water, and agitate it in an ultrasound bath for 90 s for each soak.",
    "Dry the slide on a hotplate to remove the moisture before sealing it in a desiccator and storing it in a refrigerator.\nChip assembly\nRepeat steps 1.1.1-1.1.4, but with SU8-2025-negative photoresist and the parameter setting referred called the Microchem protocol18, to prepare a silicon mold with a photomask.\nFabricate a PDMS microchannel (40 mm x 25 mm x 5 mm, L x W x H) and a small PDMS slab (800 µm-wide groove structure) using soft lithography.\nPunch the microchannel for fluid access ports and clean it with tape and then with IPA.\nShield the patterned area of the glass substrate with the PDMS slab, and apply RIE (100 W, 500 mTorr, 60 s) to remove PLL-g-PEG from the peripheral area.\nTreat the microchannel with a reduced dose of RIE (25 W, 500 mTorr, 25 s), and then align it to the patterned glass substrate (with the small PDMS slab removed); bring the microchannel and the patterned glass substrate in conformal contact under a stereoscope.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55106/55106fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Schematic diagrams for microfabrication and chip assembly. a) Pattern of gold dots on the glass substrate. b) Preparation of the glass substrate for cell patterning via MAPL. c) Assembly of the microfluidic channel with plasma bonding.

A schematic diagram for the chip assembly and cell attachment is shown in Figure 3c.\n\t\nPrime the chip with PBS for 30 min at 1 µL/min, and then infuse fibronectin solution (50 µg/mL in PBS, 1 µL/min) for 45 min.",
    "While waiting, trypsinize cell culture with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, wash them in culture medium, centrifuge individual cells, and reconstitute the cell suspension in pre-warmed (37 °C) culture medium at 5x106 cells/mL.\nReplace the fibronectin solution with PBS and flush the chip at 10 µL/min for 5 min.\nInject the prepared cell suspension into the chip, stop the flow, clamp the outlet, and maintain the chip in a cell culture incubator for 30 min.\nRelease the outlet and flush the chip with cell culture medium at 10 µL/min for 5 min. Reduce the perfusion flow rate of the culture medium to 0.75 µL/min and maintain the cell culture for 2 h in the incubator.\n2. Bubble Generation and Flow Visualization\nNOTE: A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 4a for tandem bubble generation and the resultant flow interaction with a single cell grown nearby in a microfluidic channel.\nGeneration of tandem bubbles with two lasers and timing control\nPlace the microfluidic chip on the stage of an inverted microscope and align the foci of two pulsed Nd:YAG lasers (λ = 532 nm, 5-ns pulse duration) on a pair of patterned gold dots separated by 40 µm.\nUse a digital delay generator to trigger the two lasers with a time delay about 2.5 µs to produce two bubbles initiated at the gold dots.\nAdjust the laser output energy (~10 µJ) to produce a maximum diameter of the bubbles within 50 ± 2 µm.\nSynchronize a high-speed camera (200-ns exposure and 2 million frames per second (fps)) to the lasers and capture the dynamics of bubble expansion, collapse, bubble-bubble interaction, and jet formation.\nQuantification of jet velocity",
    "Record the position of the jet tip (J1) at the proximal end of the first bubble (B1) and the distal end of B1, starting at the generation of the second bubble (B2) and ending with the touchdown of J1 towards the distal end of B1; see the schematic in Figure 5a.\nLinearly fit the time course of position for both the proximal (jet tip) and the distal ends. Calculate the slope of the tip position versus time curve for the proximal end to determine the jet speed. The intersection of the two lines indicates the jet touchdown time. More details can be found in Reference 19.\nVisualization of the tandem bubble-induced flow field\nPrepare 1 µm of polystyrene (PS) bead suspension in DI water (2.6% w/v) and inject the beads into the microfluidic chip.\nGenerate tandem bubbles as described in step 2.1.1-2.1.3.\nRecord the tandem bubble dynamics using a high-speed video camera at a framing rate of 5 M fps with a 100-ns exposure time.\nUpload the acquired image sequence into a commercial PIV software.\nDivide each image into smaller interrogation windows of 16 x 16 pixels (px) with a 75% overlap.\nApply multi-pass iteration and regional filters to reduce the errors in velocity field computation, and output the results in a velocity vector map.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55106/55106fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Schematic of the experimental setup and image recording. a) Experimental setup for tandem bubble generation. b) Time sequence used for different types of imaging acquisitions.

    "NOTE: The tandem bubble is produced next to the target cells, and the resultant bioeffects are studied in a standoff distance-dependent manner. The time sequence for different types of image acquisitions is depicted in Figure 4b.\nMembrane poration and macromolecular uptake\n\tNOTE: The uptake of extracellular macromolecules into the target cell is characterized by the progressive diffusion of membrane impermeant propidium iodide (PI) through the poration site on the cell membrane.\n\t\nFollowing step 1.5, replace the regular culture medium (i.e., DMEM) with PI solution (100 µg/mL in DMEM) running at a perfusion flow rate of 0.5 µL/min throughout the experiment.\nProgram the microscope control software to automatically select the PI fluorescent cube on the rotating turret and synchronize the timing of the CCD camera with the PI fluorescence excitation to capture fluorescence images with an exposure time of 200 ms.\nAfter the two laser foci are aligned to a pair of gold dots next to a target cell, record both bright field (BF) and fluorescence (FL) images before the tandem bubble treatment.\nUse microscope control software to immediately start a time-lapse fluorescence image recording of the target cell shortly after step 2.1 to capture the history of PI uptake.\nMembrane deformation\nPrepare 1-µm beads (1% w/v, activated with water-soluble carbodiimide) and functionalize them with Peptide-2000 (100 µg/mL in PBS).\nFollowing step 1.5, incubate the attached cells with the functionalized beads at a density of 1x109 beads/mL at 37 °C for 30 min.\nRepeat step 2.1 to produce tandem bubbles next to the target cell and record the cell deformation with an ultra-high-speed camera running at a framing rate of 5 million fps.",
    "Identify a triad of 3 beads that remain on the imaging plane throughout the experiment and compile their positions as (x1, y1) (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) in the experiment coordinates.\nCalculate the area of the triad before and after the tandem bubble treatment using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55106/55106eq1.jpg\nCalculate the area strain as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55106/55106eq2.jpg\nBased on the coordinates of the three vertices before and after the tandem bubble treatment, calculate the local principal strain and area strain following established protocols20,21.\nViability and apoptosis\n\tNOTE: FITC Annexin V labels cells, including apoptotic ones, through the externalization of phosphatidylserine (green fluorescence). PI labels the nuclei of necrotic cells (red fluorescence). Bright field imaging is used to document cell morphology and to assist with the identification of cell viability and apoptosis.\n\t\nRecord the position of each treated cell in the microfluidic channel (facilitated by the address labels in the channel, see Figure 2b) while repeating step 3.1.\nIncubate the treated cells in the cell culture medium for another 2 h before perfusing the chip with FITC Annexin V solution for 15 min. Positive cells display green fluorescence.\nRepeat step 3.3.2 24 h after the tandem bubble treatment to study the long-term bioeffects in the targeted cells.\nCalcium response\nMix 3 µL of fura-2 AM stock solution (1 mg/mL in DMSO) with 3 µL of 10% w/v Pluronic F-127 in 500 µL of reduced serum medium to prepare the final labeling solution (6 µM).\nFollowing step 1.5, replace the cell culture medium with the labelling solution and incubate under room temperature in the dark for 40 min (1 µL/min perfusion rate).\nRefill the channel with the reduced serum medium (0.75 µL/min perfusion rate) before starting the cell experiment.",
    "Start ratiometric imaging (wavelength: 340/380 nm, 50-ms exposure) of the target cell using the commercial PTI system.\nAfter 10 s of ratiometric imaging of the cell at resting level, produce tandem bubbles as in step 2.1; first record with an interframe time (IFT) of 0.1 s for 1 min, then increase the IFT to 1 s for another min, and further increase to 5 s after 2 min.\nUse the PTI software to calculate the ratio R = F340/F380 in the region of interest (ROI), which is proportional to the intracellular calcium concentration.\nSubscription Required.
