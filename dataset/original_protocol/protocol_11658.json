  "procedures": [
    "1. Preparation of solutions\nPrepare FAA fixative by adding 2.5 mL of 37% formaldehyde, 2.5 mL of glacial acetic acid, and 45 mL of 70% ethanol in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Vortex and store it at 4 °C. Freshly prepare FAA fixative just before use.\n\tCAUTION: 37% formaldehyde is corrosive and potentially carcinogenic if exposed or inhaled. The fixative must be performed in a fume hood while wearing appropriate personal protective equipment.\nPrepare clearing solution by adding 5 mL of 100% glycerol, 40 g chloral hydrate, and 10 mL of distilled water in a 100 mL glass bottle wrapped with tin foil. Dissolve using a magnetic stirrer overnight at room temperature. The prepared solution can be stored at 4 °C for up to 6 months.\n\tCAUTION: Chloral hydrate is carcinogenic and has a pungent smell. Perform the experiment in a fume hood and wear appropriate personal protective equipment. Chloral hydrate is easy to deliquesce in the air and should not be stored in large quantities. The clearing solution can decompose when exposed to light and should be kept away from light.\nPrepare the disinfectant solution by adding 10 mL of 6% sodium hypochlorite, 40 mL distilled water, and 50 µL Tween-20 in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Vortex and store it at room temperature. Freshly prepare the disinfectant solution just before use.\n\tNOTE: The effective chlorine content of sodium hypochlorite that has been placed for a long time may decrease, and the content of 6% sodium hypochlorite can be increased according to the actual situation. \n2. Seed collection",
    "Sow tomato seeds (S. lycopersicum L. cv. Micro-Tom, see Table of Materials) in 8 cm × 8 cm × 8 cm square basins full with a 1:1 mixture of flower nutrient soil and substrate (v/v) (see Table of Materials), and grow in a growth room with 16/8 h light/dark periods at 24 ± 2 °C (day) and 18 ± 2 °C (night), 60%-70% relative humidity, and a light intensity of 4,000 Lux. Approximately 6 weeks later, plants entered the flowering stage.\nTag the flowering date of independent flowers at anthesis (opening angle of the petals is 90°), and record the day after flowering (DAF).\nHarvest the fruits from 3 to 23 DAF tomato plants and immediately put them on ice. Divide fruits (seeds or embryos) from 3 to 23 DAF into early (3-10 DAF), middle (11-16 DAF), and late (17-23 DAF) fruits (seeds or embryos).\n\tNOTE: Do not collect too many fruits at a time and ensure that the seeds in each fruit are stripped within 1 h for further treatment.\nFor early fruits, break the fruit and put it on a slide, and collect fresh seeds carefully with precision forceps under the stereomicroscope (see Table of Materials) at 1x to 4x magnification. For middle and late fruits, break the fruit and directly collect fresh seeds using precision forceps.\n3. Chloral hydrate-based clearing of seeds\nNOTE: Conventional35 and optimized protocols were compared in this study for their seed clearing efficiency.\nClearing using a conventional protocol\nPlace fresh seeds (obtained in step 2.4) immediately in a 2 mL centrifuge tube containing 1.5 mL FAA fixative and incubate on an orbital shaker (5 rpm, see Table of Materials) for 4 h at room temperature.",
    "Dehydrate these seeds in an ethanol series of 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol (v/v) for 1 h each on an orbital shaker (5 rpm).\nPlace the seeds in 3-5 drops of clearing solution (~100 µL) on the slide and gently cover the sample with a coverslip. Replace the slide with a single concave slide (see Table of Materials) for middle and late seeds.\nKeep these slides or single concave slides at room temperature for 30 min (3 DAF), 2 h (6 DAF), 1 day (9 DAF), 3 days (12 DAF), or 7 days (14 to 22 DAF) depending on the developmental stages of the seed material (the younger the materials, the faster the clearing speed).\nObserve the samples with a differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope equipped with a digital camera (see Table of Materials) at 10x, 20x, and 40x magnification. Adjust and optimize the transmitted light brightness, DIC slider, and condenser aperture in real time for each sample and capture images.\nClearing using the optimized protocol\nPlace fresh seeds (obtained in step 2.4) directly into a 2 mL centrifuge tube containing 1.5 mL disinfectant solution (step 1.3).\n\t\tNOTE: The number of seeds collected in the 2 mL centrifuge tube varies according to the developmental stage of the seeds. Details are listed in Table 1.\nIncubate the samples on an orbital shaker (30 rpm) at room temperature for 3 to 50 min until the innermost seed coat outline is clearly visible. Discard the disinfectant solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The incubation time required depends on the seed developmental stage (the later the seeds, the longer will be the incubation time). Details are listed in Table 1.",
    "For middle and late seeds, transfer the seeds onto a slide and remove the seed mucilage with forceps and a dissecting needle under a stereomicroscope at 1x to 4x magnification. Transfer the seeds back into the original centrifuge tube using forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is not necessary for early seeds.\nWash the seeds 5x with 1.5 mL deionized water, 10 s each time. Discard the deionized water.\nAdd a clearing solution of 2 × the volume of the seeds, followed by vacuum treatment for 0 to 50 min (Table 1) with a vacuum pump (see Table of Materials). Intermittent vacuum treatment is performed with each vacuum treatment for 10 min spaced at 10 min intervals.\nReplace with a fresh clearing solution of 2 × the volume of the seeds. Keep the 2 mL centrifuge tube containing the seeds at room temperature and protected from light for 30 min to 7 days to facilitate clearing (Table 1). During the incubation, for late embryos, replace the clearing solution daily with fresh solution and subject the seeds to vacuum treatment for 10 min.\nPrepare the cleared seeds on slides or single-concave slides and observe with the DIC microscope equipped with a digital camera at 10x, 20x, and 40x magnification. Adjust and optimize the transmitted light brightness, DIC slider, and condenser aperture in real time for each sample and capture images.\nSubscription Required.
