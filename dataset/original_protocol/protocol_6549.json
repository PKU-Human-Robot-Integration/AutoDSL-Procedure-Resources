    "Isolation of good quality human spermatozoaFor assessment of the acrosome reaction it is preferable to use a highly motile sperm preparation free from contaminants such as leukocytes, germ cells and dead spermatozoa. Accordingly, below we describe a density-gradient isolation protocol compatible with the fractionation of high-quality human spermatozoa from within an ejaculate.Allow 30-60 min for complete liquefaction of the fresh semen, before preparing samples for routine semen analysis in accordance with WHO criteria (World Health Organization, 2010). Score at least 100 cells in each of two duplicates for cell motility, viability and morphology (with at least 5 microscope fields of view being examined in each duplicate count).Assess sperm morphology in accordance with WHO criteria in the presence of Diff-Quik staining using 400× magnification and bright field microscopy (World Health Organization, 2010).Assess sperm motility using phase contrast microscope optics (400× magnification), and classify cells as either motile (i.e., sperm displaying any form of motility ranging from rapid progressive to non-progressive) or immotile (World Health Organization, 2010).Assess sperm viability by Eosin Y exclusion method (dead cells stain red with Eosin Y) (World Health Organization, 2010).Fractionate human semen samples over a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (comprising 40% and 80% Percoll suspensions; Recipe 7).Assemble the gradient by using a transfer pipette to add 3 ml 40% Percoll to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Then underlay the 40% fraction with 3 ml 80% Percoll (one gradient is required per semen sample and should be prepared and maintained at 37 °C for no more than 30 min prior to use to avoid loss of gradient).Layer semen sample atop the 40% Percoll suspensionCentrifuge gradient at 500 × g for 30 min at room temperature using a swing-out rotor.",
    "Sperm cells collected from the base of the 80% Percoll suspension are nominally referred as ‘good quality’ or ‘mature’ spermatozoa, whereas those partitioning at the 40/80% Percoll interface are referred to as ‘poor quality’ spermatozoa. The latter population of spermatozoa are characterized by reduced functionality, including compromised ability to complete acrosomal exocytosis (Zhou et al., 2017). Thus, recover the former population of good quality cells from the pellet and discard the remainder of the sample partitioning into the supernatant.Gently resuspend the sperm pellet in 5 ml of a non-capacitating formulation of Biggers, Whitten and Whittingham medium (BWW) (Biggers, 1971) (Recipes 6 and 8).Re-assess sperm motility as described above and then wash the remainder of the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min at room temperature in a swing-out rotor. Resuspend the good quality spermatozoa in medium appropriate to experimental requirements.Assess the total number of good quality spermatozoa recovered after Percoll isolation by diluting an aliquot (1:20) in fixative (Recipe 4) and loading into the counting chambers of an improved Neubauer hemocytometer. Assess the samples within 10 min and ensure a minimum of 200 spermatozoa are counted per replicate. Calculate the total number of spermatozoa per sample (World Health Organization, 2010).Note: If, the total number good quality sperm recovered after Percoll isolation is below a threshold of 2 × 106 cells, the experiment should not proceed.Induction of human sperm capacitationTo induce capacitation in vitro, incubate spermatozoa in a formulation of BWW optimized for the induction of human sperm capacitation (Capacitating BWW; Recipes 1 and 8) as assessed via tyrosine phosphorylation status, zona pellucida binding competence and, importantly in the context of these protocols, the ability to complete an acrosome reaction (Mitchell et al., 2007; Redgrove et al., 2011).",
    "Vehicle control and replicate experimental tubes should each contain approximately 10 × 106 spermatozoa suspended in 1 ml of pre-warmed Capacitating BWW medium.Incubate spermatozoa at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2:95% air for 3 h with a gentle inversion every 30 min to prevent settling of the cells.Note: The cap of each should be loosened during incubation to facilitate gas exchange. After incubation, prepare sperm for assessment of their ability to undergo an acrosome reaction utilizing the assay protocols outlined below.Stimulation of acrosomal exocytosis in vitroHere, we describe optimized methodology for the induction of acrosomal exocytosis in capacitated populations of human spermatozoa using either a calcium ionophore (A23187) or progesterone challenge based on studies conducted by Zhou et al. (2017). Whilst both A23187 and progesterone are effective agonists, capable of modulating an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels needed to initiate this event, we note that these two stimuli elicit acrosomal exocytosis via distinct mechanisms. Thus, exposure to progesterone reportedly leads to stimulation of ion channels and the initiation of intracellular signaling mechanisms and effector pathways that regulate the progression of the acrosome reaction. In contrast, by directly facilitating Ca2+ influx, the A23187 ionophore has the potential to bypass the downstream regulatory pathways and is thus relatively forgiving of the functional status of exposed spermatozoa (Tateno et al., 2013). It follows that A23187 challenge tends to elicit higher rates of acrosome reaction (~40-50%) than that of progesterone (~30-40%) (Zhou et al., 2017). From a clinical perspective, this variability in agonist response is reflected in acrosome reaction rates following A23187 challenge offering lower discriminative power for predicting in vitro fertilization (IVF) success rate than those achieved using progesterone (Krausz et al., 1996).",
    "Moreover, even at relatively high concentrations, progesterone is less cytotoxic than A23187 and thus better suited to the preparation of live acrosome-reacted spermatozoa compatible with downstream clinical applications such as micromanipulation (Parinaud et al., 1992).To induce acrosomal exocytosis, incubate capacitated human spermatozoa at 37 °C with 1 ml of Capacitating BWW supplemented with either:2.5 µM A23187 for 30 min. Note that a 10 mM stock solution is first diluted 1:2,000 in Capacitating BWW, then mixed 1:1 (v/v) with spermatozoa.Or15 µM progesterone* for 2 h. Note that a 75 mM stock solution is first diluted 1:500 in Capacitating BWW, then mixed 1:10 (v/v) with spermatozoa.Or DMSO vehicle control (diluted to an equivalent concentration to that used in the preparation of either stimulant).*Note: If using the progesterone agonist to induce acrosomal exocytosis, ensure that the pH of the Capacitating BWW medium is buffered within the range of 7.00-7.05; which has been experimentally determined to induce optimal levels of acrosomal exocytosis in human spermatozoa (Zhou et al., 2017). No such adjustment of Capacitating BWW medium pH is required if using A23187. At the completion of the appropriate induction period, remove 10 µl from each tube for assessment of sperm motility and viability to ensure neither are adversely affected by any of the treatments.Pellet the remainder of the sperm suspension by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature in a fixed rotor before resuspension in 500 µl of pre-warmed hypo-osmotic swelling (HOS) medium (Recipe 3) and incubation for an additional 30 min at 37 °C.Note: The HOS test is used to differentiate those cells that were viable at the time of acrosome reaction induction (i.e., swollen curled tails) as opposed moribund/dead cells (i.e.",
    ", non-swollen straight tails) that may have experienced premature/spontaneous loss of the acrosomal contents independent of having completed a physiological acrosome reaction (Jeyendran et al., 1984). After completion of incubation in HOS medium, pellet the sperm suspension by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min in a fixed rotor, before fixing spermatozoa by resuspending the pellet in 500 µl of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for 10 min at room temperature.As outlined below, resuspend and wash PFA fixed spermatozoa in a medium appropriate for detection of acrosomal exocytosis.Assessment of sperm acrosome statusThe completion of acrosomal exocytosis may be assessed using either histochemical or immunofluorescence techniques (Nixon et al., 2020), the latter of which relies on labeling of permeabilized cells with fluorescently labeled lectins [e.g., Pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Concanavalin A lectin (ConA)] or antibodies directed against acrosome-associated antigens (e.g., anti-CD46, anti-acrosin antibodies) (Aitken and Brindle, 1993; Carver-Ward et al., 1997; Larson and Miller, 1999). Both approaches are relatively simple, reproducible and produce clearly differentiated staining patterns (Figures 1 and 2).Histochemical labeling of the sperm acrosome (Figure 1):Below we describe a simple and rapid single staining protocol based on the application of Coomassie Blue G-250 to produce intense labeling of the protein-rich acrosomal contents (Larson and Miller, 1999). Although this single step protocol is not capable of discriminating live spermatozoa (and therefore completion of a physiological acrosome reaction), this objective can be achieved by performing Coomassie Blue labeling in concert with the hypo-osmotic swelling test (Jeyendran et al., 1984), the principles of which are described above.",
    "Although histochemical techniques may lack the inherent sensitivity achieved using fluorophore conjugated lectins, they nonetheless have several advantages, including that they are relatively inexpensive and easy to perform, utilize stains that are stable (thus avoiding issues of photo-bleaching and deterioration of signal intensity that are common to fluorescent reagents), and the labeled spermatozoa can be readily visualized using standard light microscopy; infrastructure that is commonly available in clinical laboratories (as opposed to expensive specialist fluorescence instrumentation).Wash PFA fixed spermatozoa twice by centrifugation at room temperature and resuspension in 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 9.0). Briefly, centrifuge the sperm suspension at 500 × g for 5 min in a fixed rotor. Carefully aspirate and discard all but 20-40 µl of the supernatant. Resuspend the sperm pellet and the remaining supernatant in 1.5 ml 100 mM ammonium acetate by gentle pipetting. Repeat the washing procedure.Resuspend the resultant sperm pellet in 1 ml of 100 mM ammonium acetate and then smear 50 μl of this sperm suspension onto a glass microscope slide using another glass slide. Briefly, using a clean slide, pull the sperm suspension droplet across the surface of the slide at a 45° angle. This technique should be completed within 1 s, ensuring that the smear will be thin and evenly distributed across the slide surface.Inspect the wet smears by phase-contrast microscopy (×400) to ensure that the spermatozoa are evenly distributed on the slides without clumping.Allow the slides to air-dry thoroughly. Approximately 15 min should be sufficient, but slides may otherwise be left overnight at this step.Immerse sperm smears in freshly prepared Coomassie Blue stain (Recipe 2) and incubate for 2 min at room temperature.Thoroughly wash slides using distilled water to remove excess stain prior to air-drying (~15 min).",
    "Mount a coverslip on the dried, stained slide with 20 µl of DPX Mountant. Allow the DPX Mountant medium to dry completely (~30 min), excess can be removed by blotting the slide with tissue.Observe the slide under oil-immersion brightfield optics at 1,000 × magnification and assess stained spermatozoa for the percentage of viable acrosome reacted cells; evaluating a minimum of 200 cells in randomly selected fields in order to achieve an acceptably low sampling error (see Data analysis below).Immunofluorescent labeling of the sperm acrosome (Figure 2):Glycoconjugates residing in the acrosomal matrix and outer acrosomal membranes of human spermatozoa can be reliably and sensitively detected via labeling with fluorescently conjugated lectins [i.e., Pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA) and Arachis hypogaea (peanut) agglutinin (PNA), respectively] (Aitken and Brindle, 1993). Although neither lectin is capable of discriminating live spermatozoa (and therefore completion of a physiological acrosome reaction), this objective can be achieved by performing immunofluorescent labeling in concert with the hypo-osmotic swelling test (Jeyendran et al., 1984), the principles of which are described above. Then main advantages of using fluorescently conjugated probes for the detection of acrosome status rest with their inherent specificity and sensitivity even at low concentrations; with the latter being attributed to a high signal to noise ratio. Furthermore, the availability of multiple different fluorophores presents the opportunity to multiplex analyses such that several molecules can be simultaneous observed in a single sperm sample (Zhou et al., 2017; Gaikwad et al., 2019).Wash PFA fixed spermatozoa twice by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min at room temperature in a fixed rotor) and resuspension in 0.05 M glycine prepared in 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at room temperature to eliminate unreduced aldehydes. Spermatozoa may be stored at this step at 4 °C or processed immediately.",
    "When appropriate, aliquot 10 μl of the fixed sperm suspension into the wells of a 12-well glass microscope slide.Inspect the wet slides by phase-contrast microscopy (×400) to ensure that the spermatozoa are evenly distributed in each well without clumping.Let the slides air-dry slides thoroughly. Approximately 15 min should be sufficient, but slides may otherwise be left overnight.Permeabilize sperm by immersion of samples in a droplet of ice-cold methanol and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. Place slides in a sealed humidified chamber (created by lining the bottom of a plastic container with a wet tissue) for the duration of permeabilization to avoid drying out.Incubate slides with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated PSA (10 µg/µl) at 37 °C for 30 min. To control for the possibility of sperm and/or lectin auto-fluorescence, include a negative control treatment in which spermatozoa are incubated with non-conjugated PSA (10 µg/µl) at 37 °C for 30 min. This treatment should yield no/minimal fluorescent labeling.Thoroughly wash slides three times using 1× PBS at room temperature to remove excess stain prior to mounting in Mowiol (Recipe 5) and applying coverslips.Observe the slide using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss  Axio Imager A1  ) (see Data analysis below). Noting that the wavelengths of the microscopic filters to be used for excitation and emission are 475 nm and ~524 nm, respectively. Assess stained spermatozoa for the percentage of viable acrosome reacted cells; evaluating a minimum of 200 cells in randomly selected fields in order to achieve an acceptably low sampling error (see Data analysis below)."
