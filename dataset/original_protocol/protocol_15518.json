    "Flies used in this assay: control: nSyb-QF2, nSyb-Gal4/+; alpha-synuclein flies: nSyb-QF2, nSyb-Gal4, QUAS-alpha-synuclein/+; 1- and 10-days post eclosion; male and female (mated and unmated) flies (see Table of Materials).\n1. Preparing the dyed fly food\nMix blue soft gel paste food coloring (see Table of Materials) with distilled water in a 1:1 ratio (v/v).\n\tNOTE: Use commercial food coloring that contains only non-absorbable dyes, as some blue dyes have been shown to have neuroprotective effects21.\nMicrowave the vials of fly food consisting of standard cornmeal-agar (see Table of Materials) in 10-15 s intervals until the food has melted into a liquid or slurry. Do not allow food to boil over.\nAdd the dye mixture to each vial of food to obtain a uniform coloring between vials. Mix in the dye mixture until the food is homogenously blue (Figure 1). Add an amount of the blue dye mixture such that the color of the food is saturated, and there is no variation in color between the vials.\n\tNOTE: This step must be done soon after microwaving, as the food solidifies quickly. If the food solidifies, microwave the vial again.\nLeave the vials of dyed food to air dry until it solidifies. Place a thin paper towel over vial openings while drying to prevent any stray flies from landing in the vial.\nOnce the food has cooled and solidified, transfer the flies that will be used for testing to the blue food.\n\t​NOTE: For narrow vials (25 mm), it is recommended that 9-14 flies are added to each vial. For wide vials (28.5 mm), it is recommended that 10-20 flies are added to each vial. Flies are not separated by sex or mating experience and include a mixed population of male and female flies, with both mated and unmated females.",
    "Incubate the vials with flies overnight at 25 °C in an incubator.\n2. Imaging the flies\nNOTE: This step is optional (Figure 2).\nThe following morning (time 0), anesthetize the representative flies with carbon dioxide for 60 s. Place the fly so that the ventral side is facing upwards.\nUsing a camera (see Table of Materials), capture images of the flies at each hour to visualize the amount of blue food left in the digestive system.\n\t​NOTE: These flies should not be used for the quantitative part of the assay (step 3), as anesthesia may affect the results.\nAt every hour, anesthetize and image new flies.\n3. Performing the constipation assay\nTransfer the remaining (non-anesthetized) flies to vials with standard Drosophila food. Number each vial.\nLeave the flies in the incubator at 25 °C for 60 min.\nAfter 60 min, transfer the flies to new vials with standard Drosophila food. Begin data recording from the first set of vials.\nDraw a dotted line down the length of the vial to mark the point from which counting will start.\nManually count the number of small, round dots on the wall of each vial. Do not count dots found on the food or vial plug.\nBegin by counting the number of blue dots on the wall of each vial.\nCount the number of opaque, colorless dots on the wall of each vial.\n\tNOTE: Each dot is fly excrement, which is a combination of urine and fecal matter22. On occasion, a fly may walk over the excrement and leave a trail, in which case, count only the original dot, not each individual mark in the trail.\nRecord the ratio of blue dots to the total number of dots for each vial.",
    "NOTE: The total number of dots is the number of blue dots on the wall of a vial added to the number of colorless dots on the wall of the same vial. This will be used to calculate the percent of blue fecal matter per hour.\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.8 seven more times, collecting data every hour across a total of 8 h.\n4. Data analysis\nGraph the percent blue fecal matter per hour for each condition.\nCompare the data between conditions.\n\tNOTE: Statistical significance can be determined in 3 ways: by comparing individual timepoints between conditions, by measuring the slope of the line over time, or by comparing the area under the curve."
