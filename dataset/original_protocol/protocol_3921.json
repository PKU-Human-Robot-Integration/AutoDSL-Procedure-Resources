    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nVirus amplification\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step details how to amplify vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in preparation for infecting cells or mice and activating their innate immunity.\nCritical: In vitro viral infection should be performed in a Biosafety Level 2 laboratory. The experimenter must use personal protective equipment, and virus-related experiments should be carried out in a biosafety cabinet.\nPlate Vero cells into a 10 cm cell culture dish and culture in cell culture medium for 10–12 h to achieve a cell density of about 80% per dish.\nAlternatives: As an alternative, HEK-293T cells can also be used for VSV amplification.\nWash the cells once with PBS, add 10 mL of cell culture medium to each dish, and infect cells with VSV diluted with DMEM (multiplicity of infection (MOI), 0.1).\nNote: MOI = virus titer (PFU/ml) × virus volume (mL) / number of infected cells\nAfter culturing for about 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2, observe the infected cells for cytopathic effect (CPE), when most of the cells display CPE, freeze the cell culture dish containing supernatant and cells directly in a −80°C freezer. A representative image of CPE is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/890-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. VSV infection-induced cytopathic effect (CPE)\n(A) Representative images of normal Vero cells and cells displaying CPE (scale bar, 100 μm).\n(B) Microscopy of crystal violet-stained normal Vero cells and cells displaying CPE (scale bar, 100 μm).\nNote: CPE refers to the phenomenon that the virus proliferates in large quantities in the host cells, resulting in cytopathic changes such as roundness of infected cells, growth inhibition and even cell death. Therefore, CPE-positive cells showed less crystal violet staining (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nDefrost the frozen cells at 24°C–26°C, and transfer the cell medium to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Centrifuge the cell medium at 3000 × g, 20 min at 4°C.\nCollect the supernatant, remove about 100 μL for virus titer determination, and store the remainder in a −80°C freezer.\nPause point: Sample can be stored at −80°C for up to one year at this point or processed as described below.\nTCID50 assay\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step details how to determine the virus titer.\nTwenty-four hours before the experiment, add 100 μL Vero cell suspension (about 1 × 103 cells) to each well of the flat-bottom 96-well plate.\nPrepare 10 sterile 1.5-mL tubes for serial dilution. Fill the first tube with 990 μL DMEM and the remaining 9 tubes with 900 μL DMEM.\nDilution of the virus to be tested: add 10 μL supernatant to the first tube containing 990 μL DMEM for 1:100 dilution (10−2). Mix, transfer 100 μL to the second tube containing 900 μL DMEM for a 10-fold dilution (10−3), and repeat until the dilution is 10−11 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/890-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Detection of virus titer by TCID50 assay\n(A) Illustrative overview of virus dilution.\n(B) Example of TCID50 assay and virus titer calculation.\nRemove the 96-well plate from the incubator and check that the cells are in good condition. Add virus dilutions from 10−4 to 10−11 successively to the plate, with one row for each dilution, 10 replicates in each row, and 90 μL to each well. Add 90 μL DMEM without virus to the 11th and 12th wells of each row as control.\nPlace the 96-well plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 cell incubator for further culture.\nAfter 3 days, discard the medium in the wells, and add 50 μL 0.1% crystal violet stain solution to each well.",
    "After staining for 30 min at 37°C, observe the cells for CPE and count CPE-positive wells. Calculate the positive rate for each row, and determine the virus titer by the Spearman–Karber method (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) (Yuan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCollection of peritoneal macrophages\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step details how to isolate peritoneal macrophages from mice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/890-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Collection of peritoneal macrophages\n(A) Illustration describing mouse peritoneal macrophage collection.\n(B) Representative photographs of extracted peritoneal macrophages (left) and their morphology (right) (scale bar, 100 μm).\nNote: Peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages can both be used to detect antiviral innate immunity (Li et al., 2016a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Wang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Here we focus on peritoneal macrophage isolation. Minimize unnecessary operations in the extraction process to maximize cell yield and avoid contamination.\nInject each age- and sex-matched 6–12-week-old mice intraperitoneally with 0.7 mL of Brewer thioglycollate medium (Layoun et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Ray and Dittel, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The inflammatory response lasts for 4 days, and the mice are euthanized on day 4 by an appropriate method approved by the supervising institution.\nNote: Macrophages will have been greatly enriched two days after injection of Brewer thioglycollate medium, and peritoneal macrophages can be extracted within 2–4 days after injection.\nSoak the mice in 70% alcohol for 5 min. Cut the extraperitoneal skin with sterile scissors and forceps to expose the inner skin lining the peritoneal cavity.\nInject 8 mL of cold harvest medium into the peritoneal cavity using a 10-mL syringe with a 26G needle. Be careful not to prick any organs.\nGently massage the abdomen of the mice for 10–20 s.\nCollect peritoneal fluid containing macrophages using a 2-mL syringe and transfer to a sterile centrifuge tube on ice.",
    "Centrifuge the peritoneal exudate cells at 400 × g for 8 min at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, the left panel), and discard the supernatant.\nOptional: To remove erythrocytes, resuspend the cells with 1–2 mL red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer per mouse, and leave them at 24°C–26°C for 5 min. Add 5 mL cell culture medium and centrifuge the suspension at 400 × g for 8 min at 4°C, and discard the supernatant.\nWash cells with cold PBS and centrifuge at 400 × g for 8 min at 4°C, discard PBS, and resuspend the peritoneal macrophages (approx. 1 × 107 cells per mouse) in 1 mL cell culture medium.\nCount the cells and adjust the concentration to 1 × 106 cells/mL in cell culture medium. Add the cell suspension to wells (1 mL/well for a 12-well plate).\nCulture at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1–2 h (Layoun et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Pineda-Torra et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Remove non-adherent cells by gentle washing with PBS. Observe the phenotype of peritoneal macrophages by microscope (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, the right panel). The macrophages can then be used for further experiments.\nCritical: Peritoneal macrophages are best used the same day or the next day after the extraction, as their condition will deteriorate upon prolonged culture.\nVirus infection in vitro\nTiming: 8–20 h\nThis section describes the steps for peritoneal macrophage infection and innate immunity detection in vitro.\nCritical: VSV needs to be stored at −80°C and thawed on ice before use. Cell experiments should be carried out in a biosafety cabinet.\nWash the cultured macrophages twice with PBS. Culture the cells in DMEM and infect them with VSV, diluted with DMEM (MOI, 0.1), for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.",
    "Replace the medium with cell culture medium and culture for the required times at 37°C, 5% CO2 (Zhang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nExtract mRNA from cultured cells and reverse-transcribe with a reverse transcription system. Detect the expression of Ifnb1 and VSV mRNA by qPCR (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/890-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Virus infection in vitro\nMouse peritoneal macrophages were infected with VSV (MOI, 0.1) for 8 h.\n(A and B) qPCR detection of Ifnb1 (A) and VSV (B) mRNA in uninfected (UI) and VSV-infected groups.\n(C) Secreted IFN-β in supernatants was detected by ELISA.\n(D) VSV titers in supernatants were determined by TCID50 assay.\nNote: To detect the antiviral ability of peritoneal macrophages, VSV infection is generally limited to 4–12 h.\nFor determining the secretion of IFN-β and the VSV titer, collect the supernatant by centrifugation at 400 × g for 8 min at 4°C. Assay immediately, or aliquot and keep at −80°C until analysis. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\nPause point: Collected supernatant can be stored at −80°C for up to one year at this point.\nThe secretion of IFN-β into the cell culture supernatant was measured using a mouse IFN-β ELISA kit (R&D Systems) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (https://resources.rndsystems.com/pdfs/datasheets/mifnb0.pdf?v=20210426&_ga=2.132074575.1128226102.1619430566-905862661.1619430565[href=https://resources.rndsystems.com/pdfs/datasheets/mifnb0.pdf?v=20210426&_ga=2.132074575.1128226102.1619430566-905862661.1619430565]).\nDetermine the VSV titer in the supernatant by TCID50 assay (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nVirus infection in vivo\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the steps for constructing a virus infection model and detecting innate immunity in vivo.\nCritical: In vivo viral infection should be performed in Animal Biosafety Level 2 facilities.\nInfect age- and sex-matched 6–12-week-old mice with VSV (2 × 108 PFU/mouse) by intraperitoneal injection.\nEuthanize the mice 24 h later by an appropriate method approved by the supervising institution.",
    "To measure the IFN-β level in the serum, allow the blood samples to clot for 2 h at 24°C–26°C and then centrifuge for 20 min at 2000 × g at 4°C. Collect serum and assay immediately, or aliquot and store samples at −80°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\nCollect mouse lung, spleen, and liver and cut into small pieces for further analysis.\nPause point: Fresh tissue pieces are placed in 1.5-mL tubes and frozen quickly with liquid nitrogen. The samples can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months.\nTo detect gene expression and measure VSV titer in mouse tissues, homogenize lung, spleen, and liver in TRIzol or DMEM, and collect the fluid by centrifugation at 400 × g for 8 min at 4°C.\nNote: We usually homogenize 1 g of tissue in 1 mL of liquid, although the proportions can be varied.\nAfter extracting lung RNA and converting it to cDNA with a reverse transcription system, the expression of Ifnb1 and VSV mRNA was analyzed by qPCR (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/890-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Virus infection in vivo\nWild-type mice were intraperitoneally injected with PBS or VSV (2 × 108 PFU per mouse) and were sacrificed 24 h after infection.\n(A and B) qPCR analysis of Ifnb1 (A) and VSV (B) mRNA in uninfected (UI) and VSV-infected mouse lungs.\n(C) VSV titers in mouse lungs were determined by TCID50 assay.\n(D) Serum IFN-β concentrations were measured by ELISA.\nDetermine VSV titer in homogenized lung tissue supernatant by TCID50 assay (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nThe secretion of IFN-β in mouse serum was measured using a mouse IFN-β ELISA kit (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nLung injury caused by viral infection\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section details how to detect lung injury after VSV infection in vivo.",
    "Note: Virus infection usually causes a variety of organ damage in mice, whereas VSV infection usually leads to lung injury, including alveolar collapse and immune cell infiltration.\nPlace lung tissues in tissue processing embedding cassettes and embed them in paraffin via the following sequence of steps (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/890-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Detection of lung injury induced by VSV infection\n(A) Steps of lung tissue dehydration and embedding.\n(B) Slide holder and slides containing paraffin sections.\n(C) Microscopy of HE-stained lung sections from mice uninfected (UI) or infected with VSV (2 × 108 PFU per mouse) for 24 h (scale bar, 100 μm).\n48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde\n1 h in 70% ethanol (I)\n2 h in 70% ethanol (II)\n30 min in 80% ethanol\n30 min in 90% ethanol\n30 min in 95% ethanol (I)\n2 h in 95% ethanol (II)\n30 min in anhydrous ethanol (I)\n40 min in anhydrous ethanol (II)\n20 min in xylene (I)\n35 min in xylene (II)\n12 h in paraffin\nCritical: All steps using organic solvents should be carried out in a laboratory fume hood (the same below). Paraffin embedding needs to be performed using an embedding machine. To protect the experimenter, harmful gas must be prevented from spreading during the experiment.\nPause point: The embedded paraffin tissue can be stored at 24°C–26°C for up to one year at this point or processed as described below.\nCut 5-μm lung tissue sections using a microtome, and detect lung injury by hematoxylin/eosin (HE) staining.\nPlace slides containing paraffin sections in a slide holder (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B), deparaffinize and rehydrate the sections as follows:\n2 × 10 min in xylene (blot excess xylene before transferring to ethanol)\n2 × 5 min in anhydrous ethanol\n10 min in 95% ethanol\n10 min in 80% ethanol",
    "Rinse in distilled water for 5 min.\nApply hematoxylin to the lung tissue with a pipette and stain for 2–3 min.\nRinse in running tap water for 5 min.\nDifferentiate with 0.5% acid alcohol for 1–3 s.\nRinse well in tap water for 5 min.\nRinse in deionized water for 5 min.\nCounterstain in eosin for 4–5 min.\nNote: Eosin is highly soluble in water. Excess stain is removed by washing in running water.\nDehydrate:\n3 s in 80% ethanol\n3 s in 95% ethanol\n2 × 10 min in anhydrous ethanol (blot excess ethanol before transferring to xylene)\n2 × 10 min in xylene\nPlace a coverslip on the slide using neutral balsam. Apply a drop of neutral balsam to the slide, angle the coverslip, and let it fall gently onto the slide, taking care to leave no bubbles. Allow the neutral balsam to spread beneath the coverslip, covering the entire tissue.\nObserve and photograph with a light microscope, as illustrated in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C."
