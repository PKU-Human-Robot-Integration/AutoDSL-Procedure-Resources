    "1. Cell lysis for nuclear fractionation\nWash cells with 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice. Remove cells from tissue culture dishes using standard cell dissociation techniques such as trypsin. Count cells using a hemocytometer.\n\tNOTE: The steps described below were used for the analysis of primary human skin fibroblasts, although an array of cell types can be assayed. Fibroblasts were grown in basal media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Alternatively, cell lysis buffer (Table 1) can be added directly to the cell-culture after washing.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL tube to pellet the cells.\nCentrifuge the sample at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the media.\nWash twice with ice-cold 1x PBS using centrifugation settings in step 1.3.\nAdd cold cell lysis buffer (Table 1) to the cell pellet (300 µL per 2 x 106 cells). Pipette up and down to resuspend the pellet.\nIncubate on ice for 10 min.\nSpin at 500 x g for 5 min to pellet the nuclei.\nDiscard supernatant and re-suspend the nuclear pellet in 400 µL of cold nuclear lysis buffer (Table 1).\nIncubate on ice for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Fractionation of the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cells ensures signal specificity. The quality of nuclear and cytoplasmic separation can be evaluated before proceeding (Table 2).\nAdd 3 µL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K and incubate for 3-5 h at 55 °C.\n\tNOTE: Volumes indicated are for 2 x 106 cells, scale up or down as necessary.\n2. Purification of genomic DNA (which includes RNA-DNA hybrids)\nIf DNA is viscous, perform sonication to reduce viscosity (e.g., sonication at high power output, 30 s ON/ 30 s OFF, for 2 min using a 4 °C water bath).",
    "Add 400 µL of elution buffer (Table 1) and 400 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 pH 8.0).\nVortex for 10 s.\nSpin down at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the aqueous phase (approximately 350 µL) to a new tube.\nExtract once using 1 volume of chloroform, vortex for 10 s, then spin down at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Transfer the aqueous phase to a new tube (approximately 300 µL).\nAdd 35 µL of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 1 µL glycogen and 700 µL of ice-cold 100% ethanol.\nVortex for 10 s and spin down at 12,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nWash the pellet with 1 mL of 70% ethanol.\nVortex for 10 s and spin down at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and let the pellet air dry.\nAdd 12 µL of elution buffer and vortex for 10 s to resuspend. Incubate the sample for 30 min at 37 °C with agitation or at 4 °C overnight to re-suspend the pellet.\nMeasure the DNA concentration using standard spectrophotometry.\n\tNOTE: Volumes indicated are for 2 x 106 cells, scale up or down as necessary. DNA (with RNA-DNA hybrids) may be stored at -20 °C, if needed.\n3. Blotting DNA samples (which include RNA-DNA hybrids) onto nylon membranes\nPrepare dilutions of nucleic acids to desired concentrations in elution buffer (i.e., 50 ng/µL, 25 ng/µL, or 12.5 ng/µL). These samples with a range of concentrations (200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5 ng) ensure that there will be signals within the linear range.\n\tNOTE: Be sure to prepare enough sample for technical and biological replicates, and for the various RNase treatments, see Step 5.",
    "Prepare a positively charged nylon membrane so that there is room for each 2 µL sample to occupy a 0.5 cm2 area.\nSpot 2 µL of each sample onto 2 membranes: one for the S9.6 antibody and the other for dsDNA antibody. Alternatively, a dot-blot or slot-blot apparatus which allows the loading of samples with larger volumes can be used.\nAllow the samples to saturate into the membrane. Wait at least 2 min before crosslinking the membrane with UV light.\nPlace the membrane into the center of the UV device and crosslink the membrane using a UV crosslinker using the \"Auto Crosslink\" setting (1,200 µJ x 100).\n4. RNA-DNA hybrid detection with S9.6 antibody\nIncubate the membrane in blocking solution (5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature on a shaker.\n\tNOTE: There should enough blocking solution to cover the membrane.\nIncubate the membranes overnight in primary antibody (in 5% milk in TBST) at 4 °C with shaking. Add anti-dsDNA antibody (1:10,000 dilution) to one membrane. Add 1µg/mL S9.6 antibody to the second membrane (1:1,000 dilution).\n\tNOTE: S9.6 antibody is available commercially or from Dr. S. Leppla, NIAID, National Institutes of Health.\nRemove primary antibody and wash 3x with TBST. Perform each wash for 5-10 min with shaking at room temperature.\nIncubate with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse, 1:5,000 dilution) in 5% milk in TBST with shaking at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Anti-dsDNA and anti-RNA-DNA hybrid are both mouse antibodies.\nRemove the secondary antibody and wash 3x with TBST for 5-10 min with shaking at room temperature.\nDevelop with enhanced-chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents to acquire signals for imaging.\nQuantify signal intensity using standard image processing tools such as ImageJ.\n\tNOTE: Troubleshooting is detailed in Table 2.\n5. Ribonuclease treatments to evaluate signal specificity",
    "NOTE: RNase treatment should be performed on the nucleic acid samples to demonstrate the specificity of S9.6 binding. Treatment with RNase H, but not RNase T1 or RNase III should result in a reduction in S9.6 immunostaining.\nDigest the samples containing RNA-DNA hybrids by preparing them in four separate tubes. Treat each of the 4 samples with either 5 U RNase H, 1000 U RNase T1, 0.5 U RNase III, or mock. Incubate samples at 37 °C for 15 min in 20 µL volumes.\nLoad 2 µL of each sample on a membrane as described in section 3.\n6. Preparation of oligonucleotide controls to evaluate signal specificity\nNOTE: Oligonucleotide controls can be used to demonstrate the specificity of S9.6 binding. S9.6 recognizes RNA-DNA hybrids, but not dsDNA or dsRNA controls, as has been previously reported34.\nDissolve oligonucleotides (Table 3) in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) to 100 µM.\nPrepare 4 reaction tubes for\n\t\nRNA-DNA hybrid #1: Mix 10 µL of ssRNA top strand with 10 µL of ssDNA bottom strand and 80 µL of annealing buffer.\nRNA-DNA hybrid #2: Mix 10 µL of ssDNA top strand with 10 µL of ssRNA bottom strand and 80 µL of annealing buffer.\ndsRNA: Mix 10 µL of ssRNA top strand with 10 µL of ssRNA bottom strand and 80 µL of annealing buffer.\ndsDNA: Mix 10 µL of ssDNA top strand with 10 µL of ssDNA bottom strand and 80 µL of annealing buffer.\nHeat the 4 mixtures from step 6.2 at 95 °C for 10 min.\nAllow tubes to cool slowly to room temperature to allow reannealing of the strands. Annealed standards can be stored at -20 °C for later use.",
    "NOTE: Annealing efficiency should be checked by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Duplexes migrate more slowly than the unannealed oligonucleotides (Table 2).\nLoad 2 µL of each sample on 2 membranes, one for S9.6 antibody and one for dsDNA antibody, as described in section 3.\nPerform steps described in section 4.\n7. Quantification and normalization of S9.6 R-loop signal intensity using ImageJ.\nSave images of S9.6, dsDNA staining in TIFF format, and analyze them using the ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).\nSelect the image invert option (Edit | Invert). After inversion, each dot will be visible as white against a dark background.\nUse the oval image selection tool to select an oval that is large enough to surround the largest dot on the image.\nUse the ROI manager to add the selected area for quantification. Ensure that the \"Show All\" and \"Labels\" options are selected so that the regions of interest can be visualized.\nUse the same oval selection area used during step 7.3 to add additional regions of interest around each dot to be quantified. Use Command + Shift + E shortcut to copy the selected area from step 7.3 to each of the subsequent dots.\nMeasure the integrated density of each of the regions of interest.\nDivide the S9.6 signal intensity for each sample by the measurement of dsDNA to obtain the S9.6/dsDNA signal ratio. Verify the results by repeating the experiments (at least triplicates for both S9.6 and dsDNA signal acquisition). Standard error of the mean can be calculated from the S9.6/dsDNA signal ratios."
