    "All the procedures presented here were performed according to local guidance for animal care (The Finnish Act on Animal Experimentation (62/2006)). The animal license (ESAVI/2857/04.10.03/2012) was obtained from local authority (ELÄINKOELAUTAKUNTA-ELLA). Adult mice (age 1-3 months, weight 20-40 g) were kept in group-housing cages in the certified animal facility of the University of Helsinki and provided with food and water ad libitum.\n1. Cranial Window Implantation\nCranial window is implanted according to published protocols 29-31 with minor modifications, as briefly described below:\nSterilize the instruments before starting the cranial window implantation. Maintain sterile conditions during surgery to minimize the risk of postoperative complications.\nAdminister an analgesic (Ketoprofen, 2.5 mg/kg) 30 min before the surgery and 24 hr post-surgery. Anesthetize the mouse using a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally. Regularly monitor the depth of anesthesia by paw pinching. Use a heating pad to maintain the animal’s body temperature at 37.0 °C. To reduce the surgery-induced inflammation and cerebral edema, administer dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) by sub-cutaneous injection.\nApply eye lubricant to protect the eyes from getting dry. Shave the mouse’s head and clean the shaved area. Cut the skin using surgical scissors and forceps along the line from the scruff to the forehead. Remove any connective tissue attached to the skull.\nSlowly and carefully drill a small well on the left frontal bone using a high speed surgical drill. Screw a mini bolt (see Materials) into the drilled well. Perform no more than one-and-a-half full turns of the screw.\n\tNOTE: Avoid those areas that are located directly above the superficial cortical vessels. Disruption of these vessels can lead to massive bleeding.",
    "To perform craniotomy, drill a circular window (3-3.5 mm in diameter) in the right parietal bone. Apply a drop of the cortex buffer (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM MgSO4 in distilled H2O supplemented with penicillin 100 units/ml and streptomycin 100 μg/ml) and carefully remove the part of the bone located inside the circular window.\n\tNOTE: To express a fluorescent protein in a specific subpopulation of cells, perform intracranial injection of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector or other viral vectors at this point in the procedure.\nPosition a round glass coverslip (#1.5 thickness code) on the cranial window. Attach the coverslip to the skull with polyacrylic glue. Place a metal holder on top of the coverslip and fix it with the mixture of dental cement and polyacrylic glue.\n\tNOTE: The procedure described above is optimized for cranial windows used in optical imaging experiments. To prepare an “inverted” cranial window suitable for electrophysiological experiments, use a different procedure. First, glue the metal holder to the skull. Drill a circular window within the holder’s opening as exemplified in the video. Alternatively, make a smaller craniotomy (less than 0.5 mm in diameter) over the region of interest to prevent or minimize the brain movement32. Refresh the cortical buffer or place a drop of silicone adhesive on the cranial window, then close it with a round glass coverslip.\nAfter completing the operation, place the animal in a warmed cage with easily accessible food and water. Return the animal to the group-housing cage only after it recovers fully from anesthesia. Re-administer analgesic upon detecting any signs of pain, including reluctance to move, eat or drink, weight loss, salivation, piloerection or abnormal respiratory sounds.\n2. Animal Handling",
    "Take the mouse from its cage and simply hold it for 5-10 min. Be calm while handling the animal, avoid making jerky movements and noises.\nAfter handling, return the mouse to its cage.\nRepeat the handling procedure 2-3x with unequal intervals between handling episodes, in order to make the mouse comfortable with the experimentalist.\nTake a small soft rag and wrap the animal 2-3x with unequal intervals.\nAnimal should remain calm and get accustomed to being wrapped. If the mouse is excited and nervous, repeat the handling and wrapping procedures.\n3. Animal Training\nStart training of the animal in the mobile homecage the next day after the habituation to handling and wrapping is completed.\nRecord the animal’s weigh daily before and during training.\n\tNOTE: If, during the training, the animal loses over 10% of its weight, it should be excluded from the experiments.\nAdjust the vertical position of the head fixation arm of the mobile homecage device in order to match the size of the trained animal. Connect the air inlet of the device to the standard laboratory pressurized air outlet (typically, either a gas tank or an air-pump that provides a sufficiently high pressure and rate of the air flow, i.e. approximately 5 bar and 300 l/min).\nWrap the animal in a rag.\nInsert the metal holder, which is attached to the animal’s head, into the head fixation arm and firmly fix it by tightening the screws. Turn on the air flow and make sure that the air flow is optimal for free flotation of the air-lifted homecage. Release the animal into the mobile homecage by removing the rag.",
    "To habituate the animal to noise, provide a constant exposure to ambient sounds (using, for example, the radio or recorded music and speech) during all training sessions as well as during the experiments.\nDuring the first training session, keep the room light on for the first hour, then turn off the light until the end of the training session.\nAfter 2 hr of training in the mobile homecage, release the animal from head fixation and return it to its cage with a supply of water and food. Leave it for at least 2 hr under resting conditions.\nClean the mobile homecage after each training session using a 70% ethanol solution and rinse it with tap water. Soak-up the water with disposable paper towel and dry the mobile homecage before the next use.\nPerform consecutive training sessions for 2 hr, with the room light turned off while the animal is being trained.\nPerform the training session twice daily.\nAfter 8 to 12 training sessions, use the animal in an experimental session for up to 2 hr at a time.\nNOTE: During prolonged training sessions that last more than 1-2 hr, consider providing the mouse with drinking water, which can be delivered either manually or using a pipette holder attached to the mobile homecage frame. Alternatively, water can be supplied for ad libitum use of the animal by placing viscous drops of hydro-gel directly on the walls of the mobile homecage.\nNOTE: Remember to weigh the animals every day before training to rule out any chronic stress effects. Exclude an animal from the experiment if, at any time point, it demonstrates stress reactions such as freezing, vocalization, or stress-induced diarrhea.\n4. Applications\nTwo-photon Imaging in Awake Mouse Moving Around the Mobile Homecage",
    "Assemble the mobile homecage. Check positions of the bridge and head fixation arm.\nWrap the trained animal in a rag. Place the animal in the mobile homecage. Clamp the metal holder in the head fixation arm. Remove the rag.\nClean the implanted cover glass from dust using a 70% ethanol solution and allow it to dry.\nPlace a drop of the immersion fluid on the cover class. Preferably, use a viscous solution, because water will evaporate quickly.\nPlace the mobile homecage device with the trained animal under the microscope (unless you have a second, identical device, which is stationary in the microscopy setup).\nPerform the imaging using either a custom made or a commercially available laser-scanning microscope imaging system equipped with a femtosecond pulsed infrared laser.\nFind the region of interest using the wide-field mode of the fluorescence microscope. Use long pass filters to assess brain vasculature and select an appropriate target area after examining the pattern of blood vessels.\nTo image cortical vasculature, inject a 1% solution of the 70,000 MW Texas Red-conjugated dextran (or its analogue), either into the tail vein while the animal is immobilized in the rag, or retro-orbitally while the animal is positioned in the mobile homecage. Tune the two-photon laser to 860 nm and use the band pass filter (590-650 nm) to collect the emitted light. Use the 515-560 nm emission filter to assess the fine details of neuronal morphology or neuronal activity utilizing, for example, transgenic mice that express YFP or the Ca2+- sensitive fluorescent protein GCaMP3 in a subpopulation of neurons under the Thy1 promoter.\nUse an appropriate software for image acquisition.",
    "After imaging, release the animal from the head fixation arm by loosening the screws. Return the animal to its cage and allow it to rest for at least 2 hr before starting the next imaging session.\nStore the coordinates of every region of interest (ROI) for subsequent reimaging. Image the same ROIs over time, and adjust coordinates each time to maximize the image overlap.\nAnalyze the images and make three-dimensional reconstructions using an appropriate software (e.g., ImageJ, etc.).\nIntrinsic Optical Imaging in Awake Mouse Moving Around the Mobile Homecage\n\t\nAssemble the mobile homecage under the image acquisition camera of an intrinsic optical imaging setup.\nWrap the trained animal in a rag. Place the animal in the mobile homecage. Clamp the metal holder into the head fixation arm.\nClean the implanted cover glass from dust using a 70% ethanol solution and allow it to dry.\nPlace a drop of glycerol on the implanted glass and cover it with an 8 mm round cover slip.\nPlace a manipulator with the air-blow tube opposite to the contralateral vibrissa.\nAdjust the position of the high-speed camera and focus it on the cortical vasculature.\nUse green light (filter 546BP30) without a camera filter to acquire the vessels map.\nFocus deeper into the cortex, approximately 400 micrometers below the cortical surface.\nTo image the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) optical signal, place the 590LP filter in front of the camera and illuminate the cortex with red light (filter 630BP30).\nAdjust the illumination of the cortical surface so that it is evenly distributed through the region of interest, avoiding overexposure. Adjust the illumination intensity so that the region of interest falls within the 70-90% segment of the camera’s dynamic range.\nUse LongDaq image acquisition software to collect images from the camera.",
    "Use image acquisition frequency of 1 to 10 Hz (i.e., between 1 and 10 frames per second) for experiments with low frequency stimulation (0.05 Hz).\nSwitch off the room light to prevent any interference with the intrinsic optical signal.\nAllow at least 30 min for the mouse to adapt to the mobile homecage.\nImage the baseline activity during a 6-min episode without stimulation.\nTo record evoked cortical activity, stimulate vibrissa in a 10 sec ON/10 sec OFF mode (0.05 Hz stimulation) with a high frequency (25 Hz) train of air puffs for the total period of 6 min.\nAfter image acquisition, release the mouse from the head fixation arm and return it to its cage.\nDo not use additional data filtering for frequency, because the amplitudes of stimulation responses tend to be relatively high in awake animals, resulting in excellent signal to noise ratio.\nConvert the obtained sets of images to *.tif stack files and analyze them further using, e.g., the open source FIJI software (ImageJ). Subtract the baseline spontaneous activity from the frames obtained during vibrissa stimulation using the Image Calculator tool. Alternatively, filter data in the frequency domain using appropriate software.\nPatch-clamp Recordings in Awake Mouse Moving Around the Mobile Homecage\n\t\nAssemble the mobile homecage.\nWrap the trained animal in a rag. Administer trimethoprime (5 mg/kg) and sulfadoxine (25 mg/kg) to prevent bacterial infection. Place the animal in the mobile homecage. Clamp the metal holder into the head fixation arm.\nClean and sterilize the implanted dental cement “cap” and cover glass using a 70% ethanol solution or 0.5% chlorhexidine digluconate and allow it to dry.\nSlowly and carefully remove the cover glass from the metal holder.\nRefresh the cortical buffer supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin and clean the cranial window from debris with a sterile hemostatic tampon.",
    "Place the ground electrode into the cortical buffer.\nPlace the electrophysiology headstage in a micromanipulator.\nFabricate pipettes from borosilicate glass, aiming at tip resistance ranging from 6.5 to 8.5MΩ. Fill the patch pipette with an intracellular solution. The composition of the patch pipette solution is the following (in mM): 8 KCl, 111 K-gluconate, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 NaOH, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, and 5 BAPTA, pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The membrane potential values must be corrected for a calculated liquid junction potential of -12 mV 33.\nTarget the region of interest using stereotaxic coordinates, and quickly move the electrode into the brain while maintaining strong positive pressure on the pipette tip. After the dura mater penetration and the pipette positioning, measure the tip resistance and discard the electrodes that show an increase in resistance of more than 10-15%, in order to improve the success rate of the subsequent steps.\nReduce the positive pressure by half to avoid swelling of the surrounding brain tissue. Further steps are similar to the standard “blind patch” protocol. To find a neuron to record from, lower the tip into the brain in a stepwise fashion until a neuron is detected in a close proximity of the pipette tip, as indicated by a characteristic temporal sequence of electrode impedance changes. The key indicator of the presence of a neuron is a monotonic increase in electrode resistance across several consecutive forward steps of the pipette (typically, a 20% increase in the pipette resistance across three 2-μm steps).\nTo form a gigaseal contact with the targeted neuron, apply a negative pressure and hyperpolarization of the pipette.",
    "Apply a brief pulse of a larger negative pressure to the cell in order to establish the whole-cell configuration. Retract the electrode by 2-3 μm to keep a good seal.\nRecord spontaneous or evoked activity during a desired period of time, up to 20-40 min.\nAfter recording, remove the pipette from the brain.\nRefresh the cortical buffer or place a drop of silicone adhesive on the cranial window, then glue a round glass coverslip on top of the metal holder.\nRelease the animal from the head fixation arm by loosening the screws. Return the animal to its cage for at least one day before the next recording.\nAnalyze data with, e.g., the FitMaster software.\nHabituation-dishabituation Olfactory Test in Awake Mouse Moving Around the Mobile Homecage\n\t\nAttach a clean cotton piece (2 x 2 cm) dipped in tap water to the inner side of the wall of the mobile homecage using a two-sided tape. Divide the mobile homecage wall into four zones by placing color markers on the outer side of the wall so that the piece of cotton is located in the middle of the “target zone”. Fix the animal in the headholder arm facing the wall segment opposite to the “target” zone and allow it to adapt to the mobile homecage for 30 min.\nTake another piece of clean cotton and wet it with a few drops of the 1% vanilla extract. Replace the clean cotton on the mobile homecage wall with the one carrying the vanilla smell. Present the smell for 5 min. Track the movements of the mobile homecage during the smell presentation period. Estimate the level of interest to the smell by measuring the cumulative time that the animal spends facing the “target” zone in relation to the total time of mobile homecage movement.",
    "Repeat the 5-min application session three times using the smell of vanilla, with a 5 min inter-session interval. Use a fresh piece of “vanilla” cotton in every session.\nPresent the animal with a socially significant smell during the last, fifth session. Wet a clean piece of cotton with few drops of urine (obtained on the preceding day from an animal of the opposite gender) and place it in the middle of the target zone for 5 min.\nNovel smell recognition in awake mouse moving around the mobile homecage\n\t\nDivide the wall into four zones by placing color markers on the outer side of the mobile homecage wall. Attach two clean cotton pieces (2 x 2 cm) dipped in tap water to the inner side of the wall in the middle of the zones opposing each other (designated as target zone 1 and target zone 2). Fix the animal in the headholder arm facing a wall segment outside of the target zones and allow it to adapt to the mobile homecage for 30 min.\nReplace both cotton pieces with the fresh ones: place a cotton piece wet with the 1% vanilla extract to target zone 1 and another one wet with tap water to target zone 2. Record the video of the mobile homecage movements for 10 min during the smell presentation session. Calculate the smell attending as the percentage of the time that the animal spends facing target zone 1 relative the cumulative time spent facing zones 1 and 2.",
    "After a 10 min interval, place another pair of applicators on the homecage wall for the subsequent 10 min period. Place the “vanilla” cotton in target zone 1 and cotton applicator wet with 1% banana extract in target zone 2. Make a video recording of the mobile homecage movements. Calculate the preference to novel smell as the percentage of time that the animal spends facing the wall segment with the novel smell (target zone 2) relative to the cumulative time facing zones 1 and 2."
