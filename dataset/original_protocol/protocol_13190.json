    "1. Cell dissociation\nMaintain RPE cells as previously described17,22.\n\tNOTE: All cells are grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere throughout the duration of the protocols.\nPrepare the required amount of PBS and culture medium in a 37 ° C water bath and place the cell dissociation reagent at room temperature.\nDiscard the culture solution and wash the plates twice with 1 mL of preheated PBS per well.\nAdd 1 mL of the cell dissociation reagent to the 6-well plates and digest the cells at 37 °C for 15 min. After incubation, observe the cells that shrink and shine at the edges under a microscope to confirm the termination of digestion.\n\tNOTE: Trypsin-based dissociation is not recommended as it gives low cell viability.\nPipette up and down gently 10x with a 1 mL pipette to dissociate the cells, and dilute the cell suspension with preheated culture medium (without Y-27632) at a ratio of 1:10. Then, centrifuge the cells at room temperature for 3 min at 250 × g.\nQuickly pour out the supernatant after centrifugation, gently resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of the culture medium, and resuspend the cells 10-15x with a pipette.\nFilter the cell suspension with a 40 µm cell strainer to obtain a single-cell suspension and calculate the number of cells.\n\t​NOTE: A single-cell suspension is essential for accurate cell counting and uniform cell seeding density after thawing.\n2. Determination of the optimal cell stage for cryopreservation\nNOTE: Because the cell state varies between differentiation methods and cell lines, the exponential phase of RPE cells cultured at different laboratories should be determined before freezing.",
    "Thaw one vial of basement membrane matrix solution on ice at 4 °C overnight. Dilute the matrix into 12 mL of cold DMEM/F-12 and mix well. Add one coverslip per well, and coat each well of a 24-well plate with 0.25 mL of the diluted solution. Incubate the plate for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C before use and aspirate the coating solution just before plating the cells.\n\tNOTE: Instructions for aliquot volume are lot-specific based on the protein concentration and are found in the product specification sheet.\nSeed the RPE single cells from step 1.7 on the basement membrane matrix-coated coverslips at a density of 105/cm2 in 1 mL of culture medium. Refresh the culture medium every 2-3 days.\nAt indicated time points (1, 3, 5, 7, and 11 days after passage), incubate RPE cells with 10 μM EdU in the medium for 24 h. Fix, permeabilize, and stain the cells with the reaction cocktail as described in the manual to detect incorporated EdU.\nCapture images from five random fields under a fluorescence microscope and calculate the percentage of EdU-positive cells. Plot the corresponding EdU-positive proportion-time curves to generate a growth curve. Then, determine the freezing window or the exponential phase for each cell line according to the growth curve.\n\t​NOTE: Reestablished hexagonal cell morphology indicates that cells exit the exponential phase.\n3. Cryopreservation\nFollowing steps 1.1 to 1.7, except that the digestion time decreases to 5 min, centrifuge the cell suspension at room temperature for 3 min at 250 × g.\nDiscard the supernatant by quickly pouring after centrifugation and gently resuspend the cell pellet in the cryopreservation medium to a density of 2 × 106 cells/mL and transfer 1 mL of the cell suspension to 1.2 mL cryogenic vials.",
    "Immediately place the cryogenic vials in a freezing container, freeze at −80 °C overnight to achieve a cooling rate of −1 °C/min, and then transfer the vials to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\n4. Thawing\nWarm the culture medium in a 37 °C water bath and prefill 10 mL of prewarmed culture medium into a 15 mL tube.\nRapidly thaw the cryogenic vials directly taken from the liquid nitrogen storage using an automated thawing system.\nDrip 0.5-1 mL of preheated culture medium into the cryogenic vial to ensure that the frozen cells gradually adapt to the new environment. Then, transfer 1.5-2 mL of the cell suspension to 10 mL of the culture medium in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge the cells at 250 × g for 3 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant by quickly pouring after centrifugation, resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of preheated culture medium, and count the number of cells using a hemocytometer to determine recovery and survival rates using standard trypan blue exclusion (0.4% trypan blue stain).\nCulture the cells on basement membrane matrix-coated surfaces at a density of 105 viable cells/cm2 in a culture medium supplemented with Y-27632 (final concentration: 10 µM). Remove Y-27632 after 24 h.\nTo determine the attachment rate, dissociate the cells again and count the number of cells 24 h after thawing.\n5. Validation of the optimal freezing phase\nTo validate the optimal freezing phase determined in step 2.4, thaw RPE cells frozen at different time points and culture for 28 days. Harvest the cells for qPCR and immunostaining analysis to evaluate the expression of RPE markers as previously described17.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
