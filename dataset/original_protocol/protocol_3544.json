    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHvKP inocula preparation and inoculation at hour 0\nTiming: 21 h\nThis step details amplification of HvKP for injection and induction of IAI in mice (Wang et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nRecover the clinical hvKP NVT1001 strain of serotype K1, which was previously isolated from a patient with liver abscess and stored at −80°C, in 20 mL LB broth for 16 h at 37°C.\nDilute the cultured bacteria at 1: 10 with LB broth and keep the bacteria diluent cultured for additional 4 h at 37°C to maintain it in the logarithmic phase of growth.\nAdjust the bacteria solution to an optical density of 0.9 at 600 nm (around 4 × 108 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL based on a previous report of this strain of hvKP (Tsai et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14])) with a spectrophotometer.\nBacteria were then diluted to a number of 5 × 104 CFU/mL in sterile PBS and maintained on ice until intraperitoneal inoculation. A lethal dose of 5 × 103 CFUs/100 μL which would cause near-absolute lethality within one week was intraperitoneally injected into 6-week old C57BL/6 male mice.\nCritical: Since bacteria harbor a very short life cycle of approximately 2 h, it is critical to have an accurate CFU number by adjusting bacteria solution to the suggested optical density and diluting it to the working concentration as soon as possible.\nHuman placental MSC (PMSC) preparation and injection at hour 2\nTiming: 6 days\nThis step details expansion of human PMSCs for treatment of mice with hvKP-IAI.\nSubculture of human PMSCs (Yen et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17])\nThaw frozen PMSCs: 1 × 106 cells/mL per vial stored in vapor phase liquid nitrogen of approximately −196°C.\nPrepare 9 mL pre-warmed MSC culture medium.\nThaw frozen cells rapidly within 1 min in a 37°C water bath.",
    "Add 1 mL of thawed cells into pre-warmed MSC culture medium and collect PMSCs with centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash PMSCs with 10 mL pre-warmed PBS, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat this step twice.\nRe-suspend the cells in 10 mL pre-warmed MSC culture medium and evenly seed the cells in a 75T flask.\nMaintain the cells in a 37°C incubator with humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 1 day.\nReplace with 10 mL fresh pre-warmed MSC culture medium.\nCulture the cells for another 2 days.\nAssess PMSC cultures: density reaching to more than 80% confluence which has at least 2 × 106 PMSCs in 75T flask.\nHarvest PMSCs.\nRemove spent medium.\nWash cells twice with 10 mL pre-warmed PBS.\nPipette 1 mL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA onto PMSC monolayer.\nRinse throughout the cells.\nPat the side of 75T flask for 1 min at room temperature.\nExamine cells: detaching cells to single cell suspensions.\nPipette 9 mL pre-warmed MSC culture medium to neutralize Trypsin activity.\nCollect PMSC suspensions in a 50 mL centrifuge tube with centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRe-suspend PMSCs in 30 mL fresh MSC culture medium for each 75T flask with 10 mL of PMSC suspensions at a dilution of 1:3.\nCulture PMSCs for 3 days\nPreparation of PMSCs for intraperitoneal injection\nHarvest PMSCs.\nRemove spent medium.\nWash cells twice with 10 mL pre-warmed PBS.\nPipette 1 mL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA onto PMSC monolayer.\nRinse throughout the cells.\nPat the side of 75T flask for 1 min at room temperature.\nExamine cells: detaching cells to single cell suspensions.\nPipette 9 mL pre-warmed MSC culture medium to neutralize Trypsin activity.",
    "Collect PMSC suspensions in a 50 mL centrifuge tube with centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash PMSCs with 10 mL pre-warmed PBS, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat this step twice.\nRe-suspend the cells in cold PBS and calculate the numbers of live PMSCs by trypan blue dye exclusion method with Neubauer chamber. Finally re-suspend PMSCs in cold PBS at a final concentration of 3 × 106/mL.\nKeep the PMSC suspensions on ice until intraperitoneal injection. Then inject 3 × 105/100 μL of PMSCs intraperitoneally into control or infected mice.\nCritical: To ensure viability and functional activity of PMSCs, it is critical to collect the cells within 1 min after trypsinization at room temperature. To have consistent results, we suggest that PMSCs are cultured for 3 days after subculture with 1: 3 split to obtain at least 2 × 106 cells for harvest in each experiment.\nIsolation of peritoneal cavity cells at hour 18\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step details isolation of mouse peritoneal immune cells without needing to affix the mice to a dissecting board or aspirating with a syringe within the peritoneal cavity 18 h after initial hvKP inoculation (or 16 h after PMSC treatment) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/466-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolation of mouse peritoneal immune cells without needing to affix the mice to a dissecting board or aspirating with a syringe within the peritoneal cavity\n(A) Euthanize a mouse with CO2 inhalation and spray the mouse with 70% ethanol.\n(B) Use scissors and one tissue forceps to transversely cut the skin on the lower abdomen.\n(C) Cut the skin longitudinally along the anterior median line.\n(D) Remove the ventral skin.\n(E) Spray the peritoneum with 70% ethanol.\n(F) Wipe the peritoneum with a paper towel.",
    "(G) Use tissue forceps to lift up the peritoneum.\n(H) Inject 10 mL of cold PBS into the peritoneal cavity using a 27G needle.\n(I) Gently shake the mouse for 1 min to wash the peritoneal cavity.\n(J) Tent and distend the abdomen by holding the mouse from the back and tightening skin folds bilaterally, then use a 27G needle to puncture into the peritoneum.\n(K) Squeeze out as much PBS-containing peritoneal fluid as possible through punctured site.\n(L) Collect the peritoneal washings (approximately 8 mL).\nEuthanize a mouse with CO2 inhalation, a commonly used method to sacrifice laboratory animals, with 30% cage volume/min for one min and spray the mouse with 70% ethanol (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Other methods for animal euthanasia in this experiment can be used but should be tested to ascertain to have minimal effects on immune cell activity.\nUse scissors and one tissue forceps to transversely cut the skin on the lower abdomen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCut the skin longitudinally along the anterior median line (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nRemove the ventral skin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nSpray the peritoneum with 70% ethanol (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nWipe the peritoneum with a paper towel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nUse tissue forceps to lift up the peritoneum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nInject 10 mL of cold PBS into the peritoneal cavity using a 27G needle (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H). Avoid perforating any organs.\nHold both sides of removed skin to gently shake the mouse for 1 min to allow injected PBS to circulate within the peritoneal cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I).\nTent and distend the abdomen by holding the mice from the back and tightening skin folds bilaterally, then use a 27G needle to puncture into the peritoneum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J). Avoid perforating any organs.\nSqueeze out as much PBS-containing peritoneal fluid as possible through punctured site into a 10-cm dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K).",
    "Collect the peritoneal washings (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]L) and keep on ice until processing.\nCritical: It is critical to use only sterile equipment and sterile materials, and harvest peritoneal washings without touching the removed skin to prevent contamination with normal skin flora interfering in the following hvKP CFU counting assay.\nStaining of peritoneal cavity cells for flow cytometric analyses\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step details staining of cells collected from peritoneal washings for flow cytometric analysis of PMN, T and NK cells using V-bottom 9-well microplate (Bingham et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Lehmann et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nCell preparation\nCalculate live cells by trypan blue dye exclusion method with Neubauer chamber: approximately 8 × 106 peritoneal cavity cells can be harvested from each control animal while more than 5 × 107 cells can be collected from each hvKP-infected animal.\nTransfer 2 × 105 peritoneal cavity cells per well into V-bottom 96-well microplate.\nPellet cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant by flicking liquid within the well plate into the sink (Cells will be kept in the bottom of each well in the V-plate).\nRe-suspend cells with 200 μL cold PBS.\nPellet cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant by flicking liquid within the well plate into the sink.\nSurface staining\nRe-suspend cells with 200 μL staining buffer at room temperature for 10 min to prevent non-specific binding.\nPellet cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant by flicking liquid within the well plate into the sink.\nRe-suspend cells with 50 μL staining buffer with antibody mix. Single fluorescent marker of each fluorophore is also prepared for compensation controls using pooled samples from control and infected mice.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.",
    "Pellet cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant by flicking liquid within the well plate into the sink.\nWash cells twice with 200 μL cold PBS.\nRemove supernatant by flicking liquid within the well plate into the sink.\nFixation of antibody\nRe-suspend cells with 100 μL fixation buffer for 10 min.\nPellet cells by centrifuging at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant by flicking liquid within the well plate into the sink.\nRe-suspend cells with 200 μL PBS.\nKeep samples in the dark at 4°C until data collection.\nCritical: It is critical to perform red blood cell lysis before step 19a if inadvertent contamination occurs during the process of collecting peritoneal lavage. (see Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nCollection of flow cytometric data\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThe step details flow cytometric data acquisition using BD FACSVerse flow cytometer according to published protocols (Maecker and Trotter, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nCondition setting at low (12 μL/min) flow rate\nUnstained sample was applied to set appropriate PMT voltages to identify immune cells in forward versus side scatter (FSC versus SSC) gating first, and then by adjusting the logarithmic scale of each fluorescence channel to baseline levels.\nSingle stained samples of each fluorophore were applied to set appropriate compensation condition to correct the signals of inherent fluorescence spillover.\nData collection and analysis\nDeliver the plate or tube racks with 2 × 105 peritoneal cavity cells/200 μL PBS/sample to the BD FACSVerse system for acquisition at high (120 μL/min) flow rate.\nPerform the analyses with gating for CD45 first and then CD3, NK1.1, or Ly6G.",
    "Critical: It is critical to adjust PMT voltage gains first using an unstained sample, and then correct for fluorescence spillover using compensation controls since the PMT voltage is correlated with the degree of compensation. For flow cytometric analyses, it is possible to use older equipment such as FACSCalibur.\nMeasurement of bacterial load\nTiming: 18 h\nThis step details bacterial plating of peritoneal lavage fluid on LB agar plates for quantification of bacterial CFUs (Sutherland et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nMake 1:10 serial dilutions of each sample (50 μL into 450 μL cold PBS).\nSpread 100 μL of each dilution onto LB agar plates.\nIncubate plates at 37°C for 16 h.\nCount the number of CFU for all dilutions of each sample.\nCritical: It is critical to keep all samples on ice to minimize hvKP growth until plating on LB agar plates."
