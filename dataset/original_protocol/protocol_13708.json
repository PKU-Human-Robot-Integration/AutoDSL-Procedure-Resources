    "All steps of the sputum processing are performed in a biological safety cabinet with appropriate personal protective equipment.\n1. Reagent preparation before starting sputum dissociation\nThaw 1% Paraformaldehyde (PFA), 25 mL per sample on ice, and keep cold until use.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic by inhalation and skin contact. Prepare the fixative according to the manufacturer's instructions and freeze at -20 °C in 25 mL aliquots until use.\nApproximate the weight of the sample and thaw enough 0.1% Dithiothreitol (DTT) for step 2.2 and bring it to 37 °C. (Aliquots of DTT should be stored at -20 °C before use.)\nBring enough 0.5% N-acetyl- L-cysteine (NAC) up to 37 °C for step 2.2. (NAC should be made fresh weekly and stored at 4 °C before use.)\n2. Sputum dissociation\nWeigh the sputum sample to determine the volumes of dissociation reagents.\n\tNOTE: A sample is considered to be small if the initial weight is ≤3 g, medium if >3 g but ≤8 g, large if >8 but ≤16 g, and extra-large if a sample weighs >16 g. The indications small, medium, large, and extra-large will be used throughout the protocol. The quantity of reagents required for dissociation and labeling differ according to the size of the sputum sample.\nTransfer a small sample to a clean 50 mL conical tube, a medium sample to a clean 250 mL plastic disposable bottle, or a large and extra-large sample to a clean 500 mL plastic disposable bottle. Add 1 mL/g sample weight of 0.5% NAC and 4 mL/g sample weight of 0.1% DTT.\nVortex at maximum speed (for 15 s), and then rock at room temperature (at maximum speed) for 15 min.",
    "Dilute the sample with four volumes of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (based on the total volume of sample + reagents) to neutralize the NAC and DTT; vortex quickly at maximum speed and rock at room temperature for 5 min at maximum speed.\nFilter the cell suspension through 100 µm nylon mesh cell strainer(s) into one or more 50 mL conical centrifuge tube(s) to create a single-cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the cells at 800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant, combine all pellets in one 15 mL conical tube, and then wash the pellets with HBSS using the same conditions.\nResuspend the cell pellet in a volume of buffer determined by the initial weight of the sputum sample.\n\tNOTE: A small sample is resuspended in 250 µL of HBSS. A medium sample is resuspended in 760 µL of HBSS. Large and extra-large samples are resuspended in 1460 µL of HBSS.\nTake an aliquot of the cell suspension for a live/dead cell count using Trypan Blue.\n\tNOTE: For a small sample, use 5 µL. For a medium, large or extra-large sample, use 10 µL. Dilute 1:10 with HBSS.\n\t\nMix 10 µL of the sputum dilution with 30 µL of 0.4% Trypan Blue to achieve a final sample dilution of 1:40. Load into the counting chambers of a hemocytometer for a cell count.\n\t\tNOTE: It may be necessary to adjust the final dilution if the cell numbers are too low or too high to achieve an accurate count. Consulting Guiot et al.20 for correctly distinguishing sputum cells from SECs and debris is strongly recommended here. This is essential for an accurate cell count.",
    "From the extra-large sample, remove 50 x 106 cells from the total and add to a new tube with enough added HBSS to create a total volume of 1700 µL.\n\t​NOTE: Consider this a large sample for the remainder of the protocol. Leftover samples can be discarded or used for other purposes.\n3. Antibody and viability dye staining\nChoice of antibody and staining dye\n\tNOTE: Table 1 shows the antibodies and viability dye that are used in this protocol and the cell populations they identify.\n\t\nLabel the tubes containing the sputum cells (see Table 2 for labels).\nUse 5 mL flow cytometry tubes (compatible with the flow cytometer used) for the sample tube with the unstained cells and the tube with the isotype control. Use 15 mL conical tubes for the blood and epithelial tube samples.\n\t\tNOTE: These samples will be transferred to flow cytometry tubes following antibody staining and fixation.\nLabel the compensation tubes (Table 3).\n\tNOTE: Use 5 mL flow cytometry tubes compatible with the flow cytometer being used.\nAdd the amount of HBSS, antibody and/or dye to each of the sputum cell tubes and compensation tubes as indicated in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.\n\tNOTE: Add buffer (HBBS), antibodies, and dye to all the tubes before adding cells or compensation beads to ensure that all tubes' staining time is consistent.\nAdd the amounts of sputum cell volume listed in Table 2 to the assay tubes.\nAdd compensation beads to the compensation tubes as listed in Table 3.\nIncubate all the tubes (assay and compensation tubes) on ice, protected from light, for 35 min. Then, fill the tubes with ice-cold HBSS and centrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min at 800 x g.",
    "For the compensation tubes, aspirate the supernatant as close to the pellets as possible and flick the pellets to loosen.\nAdd 0.5 mL of cold HBSS to the compensation tubes, store them on the ice at 4 °C and protect them from light until needed for flow cytometry analysis.\nAspirate the supernatant from the unstained isotype, blood, and epithelial tubes after centrifugation (step 3.6 from the antibody staining section) and loosen the pellets by flicking the tubes.\n4. Fixation with 1% Paraformaldehyde (PFA)\nAdd cold 1% PFA (which should be thawed by now) to the unstained, isotype, blood, and epithelial tubes; 2 mL to the unstained and isotype tubes, and 10 mL to the blood and epithelial tubes.\nIncubate the tubes on ice, protected from light for 1 h. Vortex quickly at maximum speed after 30 min.\nFill the tubes with ice-cold HBSS. Then, centrifuge tubes at 4 °C for 10 min at 1600 x g.\nAspirate as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet and flick the tube with the fingers to loosen the cells.\nAdd 200 µL of cold HBSS to the unstained and isotype tubes.\nCalculate the volume of HBSS for resuspension of the blood and epithelial tube according to the total cell count.\n\tNOTE: Resuspension volume = 0.15 x [total cell count (step 8 of sputum dissociation) / 106]. Use 50 x 106 as the cell count for an extra-large sample.\nStore all sample and compensation tubes, protected from light on the ice at 4 °C until flow cytometry analysis is performed.\n\t​NOTE: This protocol has not been tested for storage for more than 24 h.\n5. Data acquisition on the flow cytometer\nApply appropriate startup procedures for the flow cytometer being used.",
    "NOTE: This section of the protocol assumes that the person operating the flow cytometer is trained in the use of the instrument available to them, especially concerning daily procedures including checking the stability of the optics and fluidics systems, techniques for standardizing light scatter and fluorescence intensity, as well as calculating and applying the correct compensation matrix.\nUse the mixture of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) beads to ensure that forward scatter and side scatter voltages are set to place the NIST beads to span the entire plot without placing the beads too close to the axes.\n\tNOTE: This step is crucial to ensure that debris smaller than 5 µm can be eliminated by gating post-acquisition analysis. Depending on the flow cytometer used, be mindful that the smallest beads are not being excluded with the threshold (when using the LSR II or the Lyric) or with the high discriminator (using the Navios EX flow cytometer). For the Navios EX, a gain of 2 was used for the forward and side scatter, a voltage of 236 for forward scatter, and 250 for side scatter. For the LSR II, a forward scatter voltage of 165 and a side scatter voltage of 190 was used.\nSet the flow rate to medium (LSR II) or high (Navios EX).\n\tNOTE: The medium or high flow rate for most instruments can be used to acquire the sputum tubes. It is important to note that using too slow of a flow rate or too dilute of the sample may result in the cells settling, resulting in increased vortexing which is not desired. Therefore, adhering to the calculated resuspension volume in step 4.6 should result in cellular density that can be acquired quickly but not clog the machine.",
    "Adjust the voltages for each parameter used for the scatter and fluorescent parameters to place the cell populations on the scale. Use the figures with the gating strategy as guidance on how to adjust the voltages accordingly.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that all the parameters needed are selected in the parameter selection window before the acquisition or that data will not be acquired.\nAcquire data for the unstained sputum sample first, followed by the isotype-stained sample, and then the blood tube and the epithelial tube.\n\tNOTE: If the cell suspension is too concentrated to allow the flow cytometer to run the samples without clogging, the samples may be further diluted with HBSS.\nSubscription Required.
