    "Notes: pcDNA 3.1/V5-His-based plasmids expressing human corin WT and the N1022Q mutant were described previously (Wang et al., 2015). The corin proteins encoded by these plasmids contain a C-terminal V5 tag that is recognized by an anti-V5 antibody. The corin-expressing plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells (authenticated by STR DNA profiling, no mycoplasma contamination) using Fugene reagents. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 400 μg/ml of G418 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 to select stable corin-expressing cell clones. The experimental procedures were described previously (Wang et al., 2018).Protein cross-linking in cellsSeed HEK293 cells stably expressing corin WT and the mutant N1022Q in two separate 150 mm dishes with DMEM and 10% FBS (~5 x 106 cells/dish in 25 ml medium).Note: In the mutant N1022Q, the N-glycosylation site at N1022 in the protease domain was mutated (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190531/20190531001636_6058.jpgFigure 1. Domain structures of corin WT and the mutant N1022Q. Corin consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain (TM) and an extracellular region containing two frizzled (Fz) domains, eight LDL receptor (LDLR) repeats, a scavenger receptor (SR) domain, and a serine protease domain. Y-shaped symbols indicate N-glycosylation sites. In the mutant N1022Q, the N-glycosylation site at N1022 in the protease domain is mutated. Recombinant corin proteins contain a C-terminal V5 tag (diamond shape) used for immunoprecipitation.Culture the cells at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 until the cells reach ~90% of confluency (~36 h).Remove the medium by suction and wash the cells once with PBS (pre-chilled on ice, 10 ml per dish).Note: Figure 2 illustrates the protocol flow chart in the experiments of protein cross-linking, immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, in-gel digestion, and LC-MS proteomic analysis, which are described below.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190531/20190531001700_5813.jpgFigure 2. Protocol flow chart.",
    "In protein cross-linking, recombinant corin protein containing a C-terminal V5 tag (diamond shape) in HEK293 cells was cross-linked with interacting proteins (brown), using dithiobis succinimidyl propionate (DSP). In immunoprecipitation, corin-associated proteins were isolated using an anti-V5 antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. In proteomic analysis, corin-associated proteins were eluted from the beads under reducing conditions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel trypsin digestion and LC-MS analysis. The experiments were done in parallel in HEK293 cells expressing corin WT and the mutant N1022Q. Proteins that were differentially associated with corin WT and the mutant N1022Q were selected for further biochemical and cellular studies.Add DSP (0.8 mg/ml in PBS, 10 ml per dish) to the cells and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min.Note: The chemical structure of DSP is shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190531/20190531001730_1763.jpgFigure 3. Chemical structure of DSP. The chemical structure of the homobifunctional cross-linker DSP is shown. The indicated disulfide bond will be broken upon reduction.Stop the cross-linking reaction by adding 1 ml of PBS containing 0.2 M glycine at 4 °C and incubate for 15 min. No need to remove the DSP solution.Discard the reaction solution and gently wash the cells with 10 ml pre-chilled PBS.Use a cell lifter to scrap the cells off the dish in 1.5 ml PBS and transfer the cells in suspension to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Spin down the cells with a microcentrifuge (900 x g at 4 °C for 5 min) and discard the supernatant.Immunoprecipitation of bait (corin)-associated proteinsLyse the pelleted cells in a cell lysis buffer containing Nonidet P-40 (see Recipes) (750 μl) at 4 °C for 30 min. Note: Tap the tube every 5 min to ensure that the cells are completely lysed. Centrifuge the cell lysate at 16,200 x g, 4 °C, for 10 min.",

An example of silver-stained gel for proteomic analysis. Proteins eluted from Sepharose beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by silver staining to visualize protein bands. The gel was cut horizontally into 11 slices, which were subjected to further in-gel trypsin digestion and LC-MS analysis.",
    "In-gel digestion of proteinsCut the stained gel into slices using a surgical blade (Figure 4).Transfer each gel slice into a microcentrifuge tube. These gel pieces are then cut into 1 mm3 pieces.Wash gel pieces with 200 μl deionized water and de-stain with SilverQuest silver staining kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.
