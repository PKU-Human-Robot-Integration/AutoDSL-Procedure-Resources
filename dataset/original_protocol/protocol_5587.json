Set up the perfusion apparatus as shown in Figure 8.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180114/20180114232038_9401.jpgFigure 8. Equipment setup for liver perfusion. The upper panel presents the complete view of the apparatus for liver perfusion. The bottom panels present detailed images from the upper panel. Pre-perfusion buffer and collagenase solution should be warmed to 37 °C. Paper cushion can be altered with any materials, such as aluminum foil.Anaesthetize a rat by inhalation of isoflurane vapor. Place a paper towel cushion on a foam board or cork board, and lay the rat on the cushion. Sterilize the animal by wiping its fur with 70% EtOH. Open the abdomen using surgical scissors to expose the liver.Place a knot with sterilized suture surrounding the portal vein at the location approximately 0.5 cm from the bifurcation (Figure 9). Start drip of pre-perfusion buffer (see Recipes) by turning on the pump at 25-30 ml/min. Half-cut the portal vein at the location approximately 1.5 cm from the bifurcation of the portal vein, and insert the cannula. Tie the suture to fix the cannula.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180114/20180114232129_6193.jpgFigure 9. Cannulation of the portal vein. A.

    "Penetrate the tissue beneath the portal vein with a surgical tweezer, and make a knot with a suture surrounding the portal vein at the location approximately 0.5 cm from the bifurcation. D-E. Half-cut the portal vein with surgical scissors at the location approximately 1.5 cm from the bifurcation. F. Insert the cannula into the incision of the portal vein. G. Tie the suture to fix the cannula. H-I. Expose the vena cava, and cut it with surgical scissors to let the blood go out.Immediately after confirming that the color of the liver changes from reddish brown to yellowish, cut the inferior vena cava (Figures 9 and 10). Perfuse approximately 450 ml pre-perfusion buffer (approximately 15 min).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180114/20180114232204_2180.jpgFigure 10. Colour change of the liver before and under perfusionPause the pump, transfer the inlet tube to the collagenase bottle, and resume perfusion. Perfuse approximately 300-350 ml collagenase (approximately 10 min).Stop perfusion, and remove the cannula from the portal vein. Cut the liver from the abdominal cavity, and transfer it to a 100-mm sterile plastic dish. Remove the attaching surrounding tissue, such as the diaphragm and pancreas.Note: From this step forward, perform all procedures on a clean bench.Add 20 ml E-MEM kept at room temperature and 20 ml of the remaining collagenase solution (see Recipes). Mince the liver with surgical scissors into pieces that are less than 3 mm in size.Incubate the minced tissue at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 15 min. After taking out the dish from the incubator, further dissociate the remaining tissue by gently pipetting the digested solution with a wide-bore pipette, such as a 25-ml pipette, several times.Note: If large undigested fragments remain, remove them with sterilized tweezers.",
    "Filter the undigested tissue fragments by transferring the digested solution into a 100-ml tube equipped with single-layered gauze on the top. Discard the single-layered gauze from the tube top, and transfer the filtered solution into a 100-ml tube with the double-layered gauze.Notes:  When the gauze is clogged with undigested tissue fragments, remove the clogging materials from the filter using a pipette.From this step forward, all the procedures should be performed on ice, and all the reagents should be kept at 4 °C or on ice.Aliquot the filtered solution into two 50-ml tubes, add E-MEM into each tube up to 50 ml by decantation, and mix by gentle inversion. Centrifuge the tubes at 57 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant, and loosen the cell pellet by gently tapping the tubes. Add 10 ml E-MEM to each tube, and resuspend the cell pellet by gently pipetting several times. Decant E-MEM into each tube to 50 ml, and mix by gentle inversion. Filter the cell suspension through a double-meshed stainless cell strainer into new tubes. Centrifuge the tubes at 57 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.Note: When pipetting the MH suspension, a wide-bore pipette should be used to avoid damaging MHs by extensive shear stress.Aspirate the supernatant, and loosen the cell pellet by gently tapping the tubes. Add 10 ml complete Percoll solution to each tube, and resuspend the cell pellet by gently pipetting several times. Aliquot the remaining complete Percoll solution to each tube (approximately 14 ml/tube), and mix by gentle inversion. Centrifuge the tubes at 57 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant, and loosen the cell pellet by gently tapping the tubes. Add 10 ml E-MEM to each tube, and resuspend the cell pellet by gently pipetting several times.",
    "Decant E-MEM into each tube to 50 ml, and mix by gentle inversion. Centrifuge the tubes at 57 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Repeat the above wash process (Step 13) once more.Resuspend the cells in 15 ml SHM(-), combine the 2 tubes, and measure the cell concentration. (Optional) If extensive aggregation disturbs cell counting, filter the cell suspension with a 40-μm cell strainer before cell counting. There is no difference in reprogramming efficiency under microscopic observation between cells isolated with and without this filtration step.Mix 30 μl of cell suspension with 120 μl SHM(-) to prepare a 5 fold-diluted cell suspension. Remove 30 μl from the diluted cell suspension, and mix it with 30 μl of trypan blue. Count the viable and dead cell numbers using a hemocytometer. Determine the suspension volume to be used for culture.Seed the isolated MHs at approximately 1 x 104 cells/cm2 in SHM(+) (if desired, SHM(-) can be also used as control) (for example, we seed cells at 2.5 x 104 cells/well, 5 x 104 cells/well and 1 x 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate, 12-well plate and 6-well plate, respectively). To obtain homogeneous seeding of MHs, shake the plates vigorously back and forth 10 times and then right and left 10 times. Let the plates stand still for 15 min so that MHs fall down to the bottom of the plate, and then, transfer the plates into a CO2 incubator.Note: Due to the relatively heavy weight of MHs, be careful to keep the cell suspension homogeneous. Loading a large amount of the cell suspension in a pipette and releasing it to multiple plates/wells may result in inconsistent seeding density among plates/wells.",
    "We typically apply well-mixed undiluted cell suspension (generally approximately 3-8 x 106 cells/ml) using a micropipette directly to plates that are already filled with SHM(+). During the cell seeding step, ensure that the cell suspension is kept homogeneous by periodically inverting the tube to mix it.Induction of CLiPs from primary MHs using the small molecule cocktail YAC, TIMING 2 weeksOne day after plating primary MHs, replace the culture medium with fresh SHM(+) (if desired, SHM(-) also as control). Thereafter, renew the medium every 2-3 days. Given that proliferative YAC(+) cells are bipotential (see Steps 24-33), we designate these cells as chemically induced liver progenitors (CLiPs).Harvesting CLiPs for various application. Steps 20-24. TIMING 0.5-1 h.When CLiPs reach 70-100% confluency, harvest CLiPs to perform hepatic induction (Steps 25-29) or biliary induction (Steps 30-34), establish stable CLiPs (Steps 35-37), or prepare frozen stocks for future use (Steps 38-40).Wash plates with PBS(-) twice.Add 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (see Recipes) or TrypLE Express (these two reagents can be used equivalently for harvesting CLiPs), and incubate at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator until the cells are detached from the plate.Notes:  Make sure that the dissociating reagent completely covers the culture areas. We typically apply 2 ml of dissociation reagent to a 100-mm dish and use a similar ratio for other culture scales.CLiPs are relatively resistant to trypsinization, and it typically takes 10-15 min to detach them from plates.Further dissociate the cells physically by pipetting with a P1000 tip to harvest as completely as possible, and transfer them to a 15-ml or 50-ml collection tube.Note: Despite its relatively damaging effect on the cells, this procedure is indispensable.",
    "Unlike general cell lines, even if the cells exhibit round-shaped morphology following trypsinization, many of them still attach to the plate tightly and can rarely be harvested by directly applying medium onto the plates.Collect the cells remaining in a plate with 5 ml SHM + YAC supplemented with 5%-FBS (heat inactivated) or SHM + YAC for trypsin-EDTA or TrypLE Express (TrypLE Express does not require neutralization of the enzymatic activity).Count the cell number using a hemocytometer, determine the suspension volume to be used for passage, transfer the required volume to a new tube, and centrifuge the tube at 200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant, and loosen the cell pellet by tapping the tubes. Resuspend the cells with medium to be used for each application.Hepatic induction of CLiPs (at P1). Steps 25-29. TIMING 0.5-1 h for passage, 2 d for culturing in SHM(+), and 8 d for hepatic inductionFor primary CLiPs, we typically use cells cultured for 2 weeks (14-16 days). Harvest the cells following Steps 20-24, and obtain the required volume of the cell suspension for hepatic induction. For early passage CLiPs, we seed the cells at approximately 5 x 104 cells/cm2 (1 x 105 cells/well and 2 x 105 cells/well for 24- and 12-well plates, respectively). Centrifuge the tube at 200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Note: The cell density can be reduced to 1-2.5 x 104 cells/cm2 when stable CLiPs are used for hepatic induction.Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 0.5 or 1 ml SHM + YAC supplemented with 5% FBS, and seed to a well of collagen-coated 24- or 12-well plates, respectively.Note: To increase the attachability of primary CLiPs on culture plates, we recommended using 5% FBS-supplemented SHM + YAC.",
    "One day after seeding, replace the medium with fresh SHM + YAC, and culture the cells for 2 days.Replace the medium with HIM-1 (see Recipes), and continue culturing for another 6 days. Replace the medium with fresh HIM-1 every other day.Replace the medium with HIM-2 (see Recipes), and continue culturing for another 2 days.Note: Prepare HIM-2 immediately prior to use. Use P1000 or wide-bore 200 μl tips chilled at 4 °C or on ice.Biliary induction of CLiPs. Steps 30-34. TIMING 0.5 h for thawing MEFs, 1 d for culturing MEFs, 0.5-1 h for passage of CLiPs, 13 d for culturing CLiPs for BEC inductionPassage primary CLiPs for differentiation into BECs.One day before harvesting CLiPs, seed cell cycle-arrested MEFs on 12-well collagen plates at 5 x 104 cells/well. Briefly, thaw cryopreserved MEF cells in a 37 °C water bath, and dilute the suspension in 10 ml 10%FBS-DMEM. Following centrifugation at 200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min, resuspend in 10%FBS-DMEM at 5 x 104 cells/ml, and seed 1 ml/well to a 12-well collagen plate.Harvest the primary CLiPs following Steps 20-24, and obtain the desired volume of the cell suspension for hepatic induction. We seed the cells at 5 x 105 cells/well in 12-well plates. Centrifuge the tube at 200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 1 ml SHM + YAC supplemented with 5% FBS, and seed onto the pre-inoculated MEFs.Note: To increase the attachability of primary CLiPs on culture plates, we recommend using 5% FBS-supplemented SHM + YAC.(Step 1) On the following day, start biliary induction by replacing the medium with BIM-1 (see Recipes). Culture the cells for 6 days while replacing the medium with fresh BIM-1 every other day.(Step 2) Replace the medium with BIM-2 (see Recipes).",
    "Culture the cells for another 6 days while replacing the medium with fresh BIM-2 every other day.Note: Prepare BIM-2 immediately prior to use. Use P1000 or wide-bore 200 ml tips chilled at 4 °C or on ice.Long-term culture of CLiPs through continuous subculturing. Steps 35-36. TIMING 2.5-4 months (until reaching P10)CLiPs can be cultured stably through continuous passages; however, the proliferation rates transiently decrease from approximately P2 to P7. During long-term culture, the cells can be frozen for backup or future use. Notes:  CLiPs undergo a transient decrease in their proliferative capacity between P2 and P7 (if not they enter complete senescence). Thus, during this period, it takes 15-40 days until the cells obtain 30-60% confluence, depending on experimental batches (Figure 5).Prepare a Matrigel-coated plate before starting passage (we typically use 35-mm, 60-mm, and 10-cm dishes for cell maintenance). Primary CLiPs are typically passaged on days 14-16. Subcultured CLiPs are further passaged when they reach 50-90% confluence between P1 and P2, 30-60% confluence between P3 and P7, and 50-90% confluence thereafter. We typically seed cells at 2 x 106 viable cells/10 cm-dish in earlier passages (P1 to P7). However, the actual seeded cell number is much lower than 2 x 106 viable cells/10 cm-dish because the cells in the earlier passage cannot attach efficiently to the plates. Once cell proliferation rates increase (typically after approximately P6), we reduce the seeding density to 1-10 x 105 cells/10 cm-dish so that they become subconfluent after 3-7 days of culture.Harvest the cells following Steps 20-24, and obtain the desired volume of the cell suspension for passage. Centrifuge the tube at 200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.",
    "Resuspend the cells in an appropriate volume of SHM + YAC, seed on a desired plate coated with Matrigel, and culture the cells in a CO2 incubator. Medium should be replaced every 1-3 days.Freeze stocking of CLiPs. Steps 37-39. TIMING 0.5-1 hHarvest the cells following Steps 20-24, and obtain a desired volume of the cell suspension for preparation of frozen stocks (typically 0.5-10 x 106 cells/vial). Centrifuge the tube at 200 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in a desired volume of CELLBANKER®1. The volume of CELLBANKER®1 used is 0.5 ml/vial.Aliquot to serum tubes equipped with screw caps. Seal the caps tightly, and store at -80 °C for at least one day. Then, transfer samples to liquefied nitrogen."
