    "All animal work was approved by the Animal Ethical and Welfare Committee (AEWC) of Guangzhou Forevergen Medical Laboratory Animal Center (2018-0186).\n1. Establishment of the KOA mouse model\nMaintain BALB/c mice (18-24 g; 12-14 weeks old) in an environment with 70% humidity and at 26 °C with a light/dark cycle of 12 h. For this experiment, the animals were maintained in the Guangzhou Forevergen Medical Laboratory Animal Center.\nUse type II collagen to establish a KOA mouse model as described previously21. Perform the intra-articular injection as described below.\n\t\nApply 2% sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) for anesthesia and buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) for analgesia. Then, fix the mouse limbs with the tape, remove the hair with the razor, and disinfect with an alternating scrub of 0.1% iodophor and alcohol three times.\nWear sterile gloves and use sterile scissors to sequentially expose the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and infrapatellar ligament. Keep the incision area below 0.5 cm.\n\t\tNOTE: A heating blanket was used to maintain the body temperature of the mice during the operation.\nUse a 1 mL insulin syringe to inject 10 U of 30 mg/kg (0.4 mg/mL) type II collagenase into the joint cavity (beneath the infrapatellar ligament)22.\n\t\t​NOTE: The angle between the needle and the skin should be approximately 15°; then, the direction of the needle should be changed, and the needle should be withdrawn altogether.\nAfter the injection, suture the subcutaneous tissue first, and then the skin. Sterilize the suture area with 0.1% iodophor. Place the mice into the individually ventilated cages (IVCs) separately after they wake up from the anesthesia.\n2. Synthesis of silver nanoparticles",
    "NOTE: The preparation of silver nanoparticles has been described previously in detail19. The whole formulation process is carried out on ice. After preparation, the mixture is stored at 4 °C; otherwise, the mixture easily solidifies at room temperature.\nAdd a total of 400 µL of collagen type I (4 mg/mL) to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and place on ice.\nAdd a total of 200 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the above collagen, mix the solution well, and place it on ice.\nFinally, add 400 µL of silver nanoparticles to the above solution, and then mix sufficiently. The final concentration of the nanoparticle solution is 1 mM.\n\tNOTE: The mean diameter of the silver nanoparticles ranges from 5 nm to 15 nm23. This was confirmed by electron microscopy.\n3. Silver nanoparticle treatment of type II collagenase-induced KOA mice\nRemove the type II collagenase-induced KOA mice from their cages 1 week later, and inject them with silver nanoparticles. Inject the silver nanoparticles once per week, and collect the specimens 30 days later.\nInject a total of 2% sodium pentobarbital (dose: 2 mL/kg) for anesthesia via an intraperitoneal injection, and then fix, prepare the skin, and sterilize as described in steps 1.2.\nWear sterile gloves and use sterile scissors to sequentially expose the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and knee ligaments.\nUse a 1 mL insulin syringe, and enter the joint cavity at a 15° angle with the needle. Slowly inject approximately 20 µL of the silver nanoparticle collagen mixture, and slowly withdraw the needle24.\nSuture the subcutaneous tissue and skin in turn, and sterilize. Place the mice into individually ventilated cages (IVC) separately after they wake up from the anesthesia.\nPerform this injection of the silver nanoparticle collagen mixture (20 µL) four times at a frequency of once per week.",
    "​NOTE: The mice treated with the silver nanoparticle collagen mixture should be kept in individual cages. Mice fighting may occur when they are maintained together, and this would affect the experimental results. During the injection, there will be a feeling of tension when the needle reaches the joint cavity, and swelling occurs in the knee joint after the injection. The combination of these two methods allows the researcher to ensure that the drug has been successfully injected into the knee joint.\n4. Collection of the knee joint and synovial tissue\nSacrifice the mice with carbon dioxide asphyxiation or any other protocol approved by the relevant animal ethics committee.\nSterilize and dissect the skin and subcutaneous tissue sequentially, and fully expose the knee joint.\nHarvest the knee joints, including the femur and tibia, and remove the musculature tissues.\nCollect the knee joint tissues, including the femur, tibia, and surrounding soft tissues (ligament and capsula), in 10% formalin for preservation and fixation.\n5. Hematoxylin-eosin staining\nAfter overnight fixation, paraffin-embed the sections, and use a microtome to cut the paraffin-embedded tissue into 0.4 µm thickness. Use the prepared sections for further staining (hematoxylin-eosin staining, Safranin O/Fast Green, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining ).\nDeparaffinize the sections twice with xylene, soak in 100%, 95%, 80%, and 70% ethanol in sequence for 5 min each, and rehydrate.\nStain the sections with hematoxylin (0.1 g/100 mL) for 5 min, and then directly place in 1% HCl for 10 s and eosin (0.5 g/100 mL) for 1 min.\nObserve the histopathological changes of the synovium under a microscope.\n6. Safranin O/Fast Green\nEmbed the tissue in paraffin, and prepare the histologic sections as described in step 5.1.",
    "Deparaffinize the sections twice with xylene, and rehydrate them with an ethanol series (such as 100%, 95%, 80%, and 70% ethanol in distilled water, each for 5 min).\nStain the prepared sections with the hematoxylin, and wash them with PBS three times for 2 min each.\nDifferentiate the sections with hydrochloric acid alcohol, and wash them with PBS three times for 2 min each.\nImmerse the sections in 0.02% Fast Green staining solution for 5-10 min, followed by 0.1% Safranin O staining for 1-2 min.\nDifferentiate the sections with 1% acetic acid, followed by PBS washing.\nDetect and analyze fibrocartilage formation in the sections.\n7. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining\nEmbedded the tissue in paraffin, and prepare the histologic sections as described in step 5.1.\nDeparaffinize the sections twice with xylene, and rehydrate them with an ethanol series (such as 100%, 95%, 80%, and 70% ethanol in distilled water, each for 5 min). Immerse the sections in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris base, 1 mM EDTA solution; pH 9.0), and heat in a microwave oven at 95 °C for 10 min to perform antigen retrieval.\nExpose the sections to 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 10 min to remove endogenous peroxidase.\nTreat the sections with 5% goat serum to block nonspecific binding.\nAdd the diluted primary antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) against CD177, and incubate overnight at 4°C. Then, wash the sections with PBS three times.\nSoak the sections with PBS, and incubate the sections with the appropriate secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated polymer anti-rabbit system) for 30 min at room temperature.\nPerform the visualization of IHC staining by using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a chromogen.\nView the sections under a microscope, and analyze the acquired images."
