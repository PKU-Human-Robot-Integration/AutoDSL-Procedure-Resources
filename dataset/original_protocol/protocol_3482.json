Pass hiPSCs using Versene.\nWash each well with PBS.\n1 mL of warm Versene was added per well and incubated for 7 min at 37°C.\nRemove Versene via aspiration and add 3 mL of media to each well. Pipet up and down vigorously.\nSplit cells at a 1:3 split and plate onto a Matrigel-coated 6 well tissue culture plate in E8 media with 10 μM Rock Inhibitor Y27632.\nDay −1. Feed cells with E8 media.\nNote: We suggest a confluency of 50%–60% by day 0 to ensure that colonies of hiPSCs are not too large and that cells maintain an active growth phase before beginning differentiation. We have observed this step to be important for differentiation and obtaining a high yield of CD34− cells.\nDifferentiating hiPSCs to vascular cells\nTiming: 6 days\nThis step differentiates hiPSCs to a mixed population of CD34+ and CD34− vascular cells through a mesoderm intermediate step (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/370-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. hiPSCs (WTC11) undergoing differentiation to vascular cells through a mesoderm intermediate step\nhiPSCs are differentiated into mesoderm in chemically defined E8BAC medium (days 0–2). At day 3, chemically defined E7Vi medium induces the differentiation of CD34+ and CD34− vascular cells (days 3–6). Scale bar represents 200 μm.\nDay 0. hiPSCs are passaged using Versene.\nPrior to the addition of Versene, wash each well with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of warm Versene per well and incubate for 7 min at 37°C.\nRemove Versene via aspiration and add 3 mL of media to each well. Cells should remain in small colonies and should not be singular.",
    "Plate cells at a seeding density of 1.0–1.5 × 105 cells per well onto Matrigel-coated 6 well tissue culture plates in 2 mL/well E8BAC media with the addition of 10 μM Rock Inhibitor Y27632.\nDay 1. Feed cells with 2 mL per well E8BAC media.\nDay 2. Once cells have reached 100% confluency (40–48 h post seeding), aspirate the E8BAC media and replace with E7Vi media.\nDay 3. Feed cells with 3 mL per well of E7Vi media.\nDay 4. Feed cells with 4 mL per well of E7Vi media.\nDay 5 Feed cells with 5 mL per well of E7Vi media.\nDay 6. Follow CD34 MACS sorting protocol.\nNote: Volumes reported are for one well of a 6-well tissue culture plate and will need to be adjusted for other sizes.\nCritical: We suggest the media change on day 2 (step 5) occur between 40 and 48 h post seeding, when the cells have reach 100% confluency. It is important to not allow the cells to become overly confluent, as it may result in a lower yield of CD34− cells.\nCD34 magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis step sorts the CD34+ endothelial progenitor cells from the CD34− vascular cells. CD34 is widely recognized as a marker of vascular endothelial progenitor cells (Fina et al., 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Hristov and Weber, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Sidney et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Pericytes, including cerebral pericytes, umbilical pericytes, skeletal muscle pericytes, and microvascular cardiac pericytes, do not express CD34 (Cathery et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Faal et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Wang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nDay 6. Dissociate cells using Accutase for 10 min at 37°C to produce a single cell suspension.",
    "Collect cells using an equal volume of 2% FBS in PBS, centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min and resuspend cells at 1 × 108 total cells (live and dead) in 300 μL of cold MACS buffer.\nAdd 100 μL of FcR blocking reagent and 100 μL of CD34 magnetic microbeads to the cell suspension.\nMix well and incubate at 4°C for 30 min.\nWash cells with 10 mL MACS buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min.\nRemove supernatant completely and resuspend in 500 μL MACS buffer.\nCritical: Keep cells on ice before and after MACS sorting and in between steps when necessary to ensure greater cell viability.\nPlace the LS column on the MACS magnet.\nWash the LS column carefully with 3 mL MACS buffer to avoid bubbles.\nCollect CD34− cells\nAdd the cell suspension to the column.\nCollect unbound, CD34− cells in the flow through.\nWash the cell suspension tube with 500 μL MACS buffer to remove any residual cells and add to the column.\nWash the column with an additional 9 mL MACS buffer.\nCollect the flow through and place on ice.\nCollect CD34+ cells\nRemove the column from the magnet.\nAdd 5 mL MACS buffer and slowly push the column plunger to flush out the attached CD34+ cells.\nAdd an additional 5 mL of buffer to the column and plunge to remove any residual CD34+ cells.\nPause Point: The CD34+ cells (endothelial progenitor cells) can continue culture or be cryopreserved and stored in liquid nitrogen.",
    "Critical: It is important to have a single-cell suspension to prevent blocking of the column. If blocking does occur, the flow through will be slow and could lead to cell death. Similarly, any bubbles present in the column could also block the column and slow the flow through. When plunging the column, it is important to maintain a steady flow through. Too slow or too fast could lead to cell death and decrease the yield of CD34+ cells.\nNote: The Miltenyi Biotech MACS CD34 microbead kit protocol recommends using 2 × 109 total cells per LS column. We have found that this cell density can clump and block the column and have reduced the number to 1 × 108 total cells per column. If cell numbers are low MS columns (Miltenyi Biotech #130042201) can be used in place of the LS columns.\nDifferentiating CD34− cells to pericytes\nTiming: 4 days\nDay 6. After MACS sorting, count and plate the CD34− cells at 2 × 104 cells/cm2 on to fibronectin-collagen coated 10 cm tissue culture dishes in EGM-2 media.\nDay 7. Feed cells with EGM-2 media.\nDay 8. Passage pericyte precursors\nDissociate cells with warm TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C. Dilute TrypLE with media (1:1), collect, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min, remove supernatant, and resuspend in PM media.\nPlate cells on to fibronectin-collagen coated 10 cm tissue culture dishes at 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2\nDay 9. Feed cells with PM media.\nDay 10. Characterize, cryopreserve, or continue cells for further experiments.\nExpanding and maintaining hiPSC-derived pericytes\nTiming: up to passage 10\nhiPSC-derived pericytes can be expanded and maintained for at least ten passages.\nPassage pericytes",
    "At approximately 80% confluency, dissociate cells with warm TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C. Dilute TrypLE with media (1:1), collect cells, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min, remove supernatant, and resuspend in PM Media.\nPlate pericytes on fibronectin-collagen coated tissue culture plates at a 1:3 split.\nMaintain pericytes by feeding every other day with PM medium.\nWhen 80% confluent, passage cells up to passage 10.\nCryopreserving hiPSC-derived pericytes\nPause Point: hiPSC-derived pericytes can be cryopreserved for future use. Cells can successfully be preserved as pericyte precursors (day 6 immediately following column sorting) or as pericytes (day 10 and later).\nFor hiPSC-derived pericytes, freeze when approximately 80% confluent (generally day 10).\nDissociate cells from the plate using warm TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C. Dilute TrypLE in media (1:1), collect cells, and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and in a dropwise manner add Cryopreservation media.\nTransfer cells into cryogenic vials (1 × 106 cells per vial in 0.5–1 mL Cryopreservation Media).\nFreeze at −80°C in a Mr. Frosty Freezing Container for 2–24 h, then store in a liquid nitrogen freezer.\nFor hiPSC-derived pericyte precursors, freeze cells immediately after sorting following the same procedure.\nRemove supernatant and in a dropwise manner add Cryopreservation media.\nTransfer cells into cryogenic vials (2 × 106 cells per vial in 0.5–1 mL Cryopreservation Media).\nFreeze at −80°C in a Mr. Frosty Freezing Container for 2–24 h, then store in a liquid nitrogen freezer.\nRecovering hiPSC-derived pericytes\nCryopreserved hiPSC-derived pericyte precursors (cryopreserved at day 6 immediately after column sorting) and hiPSC-derived pericytes (day 10) can be recovered as described.\nhiPSC-derived pericyte precursors are recovered from cryopreservation by thawing 1 vial (approximately 2 × 106 cells) onto a fibronectin-collagen coated 10 cm tissue culture dish in EGM-2 media.",
    "After 24 h, feed with EGM-2 medium.\nAt day 2, passage cells (as done on day 8 of differentiation protocol) and plate into PM medium.\nContinue expanding in PM media up to passage 10.\nhiPSC-derived pericytes are recovered from cryopreservation by thawing 1 vial (approximately 1 × 106 cells) onto a fibronectin-collagen coated 10 cm tissue culture dish in PM media.\nFeed cells every other day with PM medium.\nPassage at 80% confluency\nContinue expanding in PM media up to passage 10.\nNote: The recovery rate of pericyte precursors (cryopreserved at day 6) is estimated to be between 50% and 70%. The recovery rate of pericytes (day 10 or later) is estimated to be between 60%–90%. Recovery rates may vary between cell lines.\nCharacterizing cells: flow cytometry\nTiming: 1–2 h\nFlow cytometry is used to characterize the cells and confirm their differentiation to pericytes. CD140b, also known as PDGFRβ, is a ubiquitous marker of pericytes and its expression is essential for pericyte function (Armulik et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Crisan et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Geevarghese and Herman, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). CD13 is also a marker of pericytes and it plays a vital role in cell migration, survival, and angiogenesis (Armulik et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Cathery et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Ramsauer et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nDetach pericytes from the fibronectin-collagen coated tissue culture plates using warm TrypLE for 5 min at 37°C. Deactivate TrypLE with 2× volume of FACS buffer. Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 300 × g and resuspend in FACs buffer at 5 × 105 cells/100 μL per tube.\nIncubate cells with primary conjugated antibodies CD13-PE and CD140b-PE at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.\nWash cells, centrifuge, and resuspend in FACS buffer.\nRun flow cytometry.\nNote: A LSRII Flow Cytometer was used in these experiments.\nCharacterizing cells: immunofluorescence\nTiming: 2 days",
    "Immunofluorescence can also be used to characterize the differentiated pericytes. Here, cells were stained for the contractile proteins, αSMA (Bergers and Song, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Crisan et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Verbeek et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) and SM22 (Orlova et al., 2014a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Pierantozzi et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), which are involved in the vascular remodeling and vasoconstriction functions of pericytes. CD31, a widely regarded marker for endothelial cells, was also used as a negative control to ensure effective sorting of pericytes from CD34+ endothelial progenitor cells (Lertkiatmongkol et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Liu and Shi, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; van Mourik et al., 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nRemove all media from cell culture via aspiration.\nFix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash with PBS.\nBlock cells with IF blocking buffer for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nApply primary antibodies diluted in IF antibody buffer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) and incubate for 16–24 h at 4°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_370_12.csv\nWash cells three times 15 min with PBS\nApply secondary antibodies diluted in IF antibody buffer and incubate for 1.5 h at 20°C–25°C the dark. Counterstain with DAPI at 5 μg/mL for the last 15 min of incubation.\nWash cells three times 15 min with PBS and store in PBS at 4°C until imaged.\nCharacterizing cell function: angiogenesis assay\nTiming: 5 days for assay, 2 days for immunofluorescence staining\nAdd hiPSC-derived endothelial cells only (1.5 × 104) or hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (1.5 × 104) and hiPSC-derived pericytes (3 × 103) from the same cell line per well of a Geltrex-coated angiogenesis plate and culture in E7V media at standard culture conditions (5% CO2, 37°C).\nDay 1–4. Feed cells daily with E7V media.\nAt day 5 fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash cells with PBS and block with blocking buffer for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Apply primary antibodies diluted in IF antibody buffer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) for 16–24 h at 4°C.\nWash cells three times 15 min in PBS\nApply fluorescence-conjugate secondary antibodies diluted in IF antibody buffer for 1.5 h at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nCounterstain with DAPI at 5 μg/mL for the last 15 min of incubation.\nWash cells with PBS and store in PBS at 4°C until imaged."
