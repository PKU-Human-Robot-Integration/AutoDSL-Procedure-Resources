    "1. Bioprinting of 3D models\nGenerating plate map and print file\n\t\nPrior to model generation, generate a plate map, protocol, and print file using the plate map software. Open the plate map software and select the Culture Cells in 3D option.\nSelect the model type to be bioprinted from the available options on the drop-down menu; this model has been validated in the Imaging Model and HTP model formats. Select Imaging Model for 96-well plates and HTP for 384-well plates.\nIn the Matrix Selection window, select Hydrogel Px02.53, containing Laminin-211 and hyaluronic acid proteins, with IKVAV, RGD, and YIGSR peptides.\nIn the pop-up window, enter the cell types as Glutamatergic Neurons and Astrocytes and enter the cell density as 20 million cells/mL.\nUse the software to design the desired plate map by highlighting wells on the on-screen plate. Include at least 1 row of 2D control on plastic in the design. 2D control on plastic wells consists of cells deposited directly into the well without any hydrogel scaffold; coat these wells as per step 1.2.\nEnsure that the plate model listed at the top of the window is changed to the intended plate model for use (see Table of Materials).\nDownload the protocol and print file for the plate map using the download buttons and save them to the bioprinter-linked computer.\nCoating of 2D control on plastic wells\n\t\nAt least 24 h before printing, coat the wells for the 2D control models for cell adherence and growth. 3D model wells do not require any pre-coating. All processes are to be undertaken in a biosafety cabinet unless otherwise stated. Plates can be coated and prepared up to 7 days before printing.",
    "Make 50 mL of 1x borate buffer by diluting 2.5 mL of 20x borate stock solution with 47.5 mL of sterile dH2O.\nAdd 100 µL of 50% (w/v) polyethyleneimine (PEI) to 50 mL of 1x borate buffer to create a 0.1% (w/v) PEI solution and sterile filter through a 0.22 µm filter.\nAdd 0.1% (w/v) PEI solution to each 2D control well, as indicated by the plate map generated in step 1.1. Add 100 µL/well if using a 96-well plate or 25 µL/well if using a 384-well plate.\nIncubate the plate for 2 h at 37 °C before aspirating the 0.1% (w/v) PEI solution and rinsing the wells 5x with PBS. Let the wells dry completely in the biosafety cabinet.\nDilute 100 µL of 1 mg/mL laminin solution in 5 mL of neurobasal medium. Add 100 µL to each 2D control well if using a 96-well plate or 25 µL if using a 384-well plate. Incubate for 4 h at 37 °C.\nIf storing plates, leave the laminin solution in place after incubation and store at 4 °C. Prewarm the plates for 1 h at 37 °C before use.\n3D bioprinting of coculture models\n\t\nAlways maintain a sterile technique when using the bioprinter, and wipe gloves, cartridges, and culture plates with 70% EtOH before being put inside the printer. Unless otherwise stated, perform all processes outside of the bioprinter in a biosafety cabinet.\nSwitch on the compressor for the bioprinter and initialize the printer by selecting the Initialize button on the bioprinter software. Once the airflow in the printer has started, wipe down surfaces inside the printer with a 70% EtOH wipe.\nOn the day of printing, undertake the guided Start of Day Greenlighting process to ensure the correct nozzle status for the print run (minimum nozzle status 2A2B).",
    "Take a bioprinter cartridge from the sterile packaging, add 20 mL of sterile dH2O in compartment A, and add 6 mL of sterile-filtered 70% EtOH to compartments B1-4. Insert the cartridge into the lefthand cartridge holder inside the bioprinter and place the plate lid into the dedicated lid holder.\nSelect the Greenlighting button on the software home screen and confirm on the software that the cartridge is in place within the bioprinter and that the lid has been removed. Initiate the greenlighting process.\nWhen prompted by the software, confirm that no consistent drips can be seen from either the left or right needles. Subsequently, when prompted by the software, confirm that water is present in the B7 and B8 compartments.\nAfter the bioprinter has completed the self-guided greenlighting step, insert an uncoated sterile 96-well flat bottom plate (separate from the coated plate for bioprinting cocultures) and insert this new plate into the righthand plate holder section of the bioprinter when prompted by the software. Ensure the plate holder is set to High Profile Plate, and the lid is removed and placed in the dedicated lid holder before commencing the next step.\nThe bioprinter will deposit water droplets into each well of the 96-well plate. Once complete, place the plate from the bioprinter and confirm that water droplets are present in each well of the plate.\nDispose of the 96-well plate used for greenlighting and allow the bioprinter to finish the greenlighting process. Once complete, the software will state the nozzle status of the bioprinter and confirm that the bioprinter is ready to print models. Place the lid onto the print cartridge and remove it to the biosafety cabinet for the next steps.",
    "Using the bioprinter software, load the print file (generated in step 1.1) into the software using the Print Run software button and open the print protocol pdf.\nRetrieve bioink and activator fluids, as indicated on the print protocol pdf, from -20 °C and thaw at room temperature (RT) for 40 min. For hydrogel matrix Px02.53 this will include: 1x vial F32, 1xvial F3, 1x vial F261, 1x vial F299. Do not thaw bioink and activator fluids in hands or water baths.\nBring 50 mL of complete media with doxycycline and ROCK inhibitor (complete media +DOX/ROCKi) (see step 2.2) to RT while bioink and activator fluids are thawing.\nOnce bioinks and activators are thawed, prepare the printing cartridge as instructed on the final two pages of the generated print protocol pdf. The greenlighting printer cartridge will be reused for the model printing stages.\n\t\t\nEnsure that there are 40 mL of dH2O in compartment A1 and 8 mL of 70% EtOH in compartments B1 and B2. Add 1.2 mL of activator F32 to C1, 1.2 mL of F3 to C2, and 200 µL of F261 to C4.\nRetrieve the PEI and laminin-coated plate from the incubator and place it inside the printer in the righthand plate holder compartment. Do not remove the laminin-media solution from the wells at this point. Ensure the plate holder compartment is set to Low Profile Plate and the lid is removed and in the lid holder.\nPlace the print cartridge into the bioprinter, ensuring the lid is removed and placed in the holder, and start the print run on the software by selecting the Print Inert Base button on the bioprinter software.",
    "While the inert base is printing, retrieve the vials of glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes from liquid nitrogen storage, thaw, and resuspend as per instructions in section 2.\nOnce the cells are thawed, and 8 mL of complete media +DOX/ROCKi has been added to each cell type separately (as per section 2), centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend both cell types separately in 1 mL of complete media +DOX/ROCKi.\nAdd 20 µL of cell suspension to 20 µL of trypan blue and mix before counting cells to determine viable cell concentration per mL for each cell type.\nCombine a total of 3 million glutamatergic neurons with 1 million astrocytes in a 15 mL tube. Add media to create a total volume of 8 mL.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate as much of the supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend the cell pellet in 200 µL of activator fluid F299.\nNote that the activator fluid is viscous; pipette up and down to fully resuspend the pellet. The cell types are delicate; minimize shearing and bubbles by using a wide bore pipette tip and the reverse pipetting technique. Pipette up and down firmly no more than 3 times to prevent cell loss.\nOnce the inert base stage is finished printing, place the lids on the cartridge and culture plate, remove both from the bioprinter and place in the biosafety cabinet.\nAdd the 200 µL of cell suspension in F299 to well C3 of the print cartridge, reinsert the cartridge into the bioprinter, remove the lid, and place it into the lid holder. Do not yet reinsert the culture plate.",
    "Initiate the Print Models stage of the print run. While the bioprinter is priming fluids, remove the laminin-media solution from the 2D control wells of the plate and replace it with 150 µL of complete media +DOX/ROCKi in each 2D control well if using a 96-well plate and 50 µL of complete media +DOX/ROCKi if using a 384-well plate.\nAfter the liquids have been primed, insert the bioprinting targeting plate into the bioprinter, remove the lid, and place it in the lid holder.\nBegin the bioprinter targeting process.\n\t\t\nWhen prompted by the bioprinting software, remove the targeting plate from the bioprinter.\nUse the guide to select where droplets can be observed on the plate. Reinsert the targeting plate into the bioprinter and repeat the droplet printing and selection process.\nWhen prompted, again remove the targeting plate, then replace it with the cell culture plate (containing media in the 2D control wells as per step 1.3.25). Ensure the culture plate lid is off and placed in the holder. The bioprinter will finish model printing.\nOnce model printing is complete, follow the cell culture methods in section 2 (step 2.8) to add media to the wells.\nCommence the bioprinter cleaning process and, once complete, dispose of cartridges and remaining liquids according to lab protocols.\n2. Cell culture\nModels are generated using 1x vial of glutamatergic neurons (>5 million cells per vial) and 1x vial of astrocytes (>1 million cells per vial).\nPreheat the water bath to 37 °C.\nTransport both vials of cells to the lab on dry ice and immersed in a water bath immediately after removal from dry ice. Thaw both vials simultaneously.",
    "Remove the vials from the water bath when only a small ice crystal remains; this will take approximately 3 min after immersion. Do not swirl or mix the cells in the water bath.\nSpray the vials with 70% EtOH and transfer them into the biosafety cabinet.\nAdd 500 µL of complete media +DOX/ROCKi dropwise into each vial before transferring each suspension into separate 15 mL tubes.\nTop up the media in each tube to 8 mL and proceed with bioprinting steps as per step 1.3.\nFollowing bioprinting models (step 1.3), immediately add complete media +DOX/ROCKi to all 3D coculture wells and place the models into an incubator at 37 oC and 5% CO2. If using a 96-well plate, add 150 µL of media per well; if using a 384-well plate, use 50 µL of media per well.\nNo media changes are required for the first 48 h of culture.\nWhen performing media changes on 2D controls and models, care should be taken to prevent inducing mechanical stress, which could detach 2D cultures or cause deformation of the hydrogel. Perform media aspiration and addition slowly using a micropipette pointing down the side of the well.\nAfter 48 h, perform a 90% media change on all wells and remove ROCKi from the media composition (see step 2.14).\nAfter 96-h, perform a further 90% media change on all wells to remove DOX from the media composition (see step 2.14).\nFollowing the two 90% media changes at 48 h and 96 h, carry out 50% media changes every 48 h, where 50% of media is aspirated and replaced with fresh complete media\nMedia composition:\n\t\nComplete media: Neurobasal media with 1x GlutaMAX, 1x B27, 12.5 nM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/mL NT3, 5 ng/µL BDNF.",
    "Complete media plus doxycycline (DOX): Neurobasal media with 1x GlutaMAX, 1x B27, 12.5 nM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/mL neurotrophin-3 (NT3), 5 ng/µL brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and 1 µg/mL doxycycline.\nComplete media plus DOX/ROCK inhibitor (ROCKi): Neurobasal media with 1x GlutaMAX, 1x B27, 12.5 nM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/mL NT3, 5 ng/µL BDNF, 1 µg/mL doxycycline, and 10 µM ROCK inhibitor.\n3. Neurite growth analysis\nPlace cells in a live cell microscope for brightfield imaging immediately after the addition of media post-bioprinting.\nUse microscope software to schedule cells to be imaged at 4x magnification in every well, including 2D controls, every 12 h for at least 7 days.\nCarry out media changes every 48 h, as detailed in section 2, placing the cells back in the microscope after media changes each time.\nAfter 7 days of data, export the images from the software in .jpg format\nImport all .jpg images into ImageJ software and convert files to 8-bit format. Load the NeuronJ plugin and trace neurite growth in images, including branch points, using the tracing tool.\nUse the neurite tracing data generated from NeuronJ to plot neurite outgrowth over time.\n4. Cell viability analysis\nAt every 24-h time point in culture, stain 3 or more wells for cell viability analysis using a live/dead viability kit. Repeat this step at 24 h or 48-h time points for the duration of the study.\nPrepare live/dead reagent media by suspending live cell reagent (1x Calcein-AM) and dead cell reagent (1x ethidium homodimer-1) and 1x live cell nuclear stain (Hoechst 33342) in 10 mL of reduced serum media without phenol red (Opti-MEM) 30 min before imaging. Let live/dead reagent media come to RT. Store live/dead reagent media out of direct light due to fluorescence bleaching.",
    "Remove media from 3 wells containing cell models/2D controls, carefully preventing gel disturbance. Wash the cell models once with RT sterile PBS. Add 100 µL of live/dead reagent media to each well for a 96-well plate or 25 µL for a 384-well plate.\nIncubate the models for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nAfter incubation, models are ready for imaging. Perform imaging on any standard microscope with red (647 nm, dead cells), green (488 nm, live cells), and blue (405 nm, nuclear stain) excitation channels. For best results in 3D models, image models using a high-content confocal microscope and carry out imaging using a Z-stack function at 4x or 10x magnification.\n\tNOTE: In this study, cell models were imaged using the INCell Analyzer 6500HS (high-content imaging system), and analysis was carried out using Signals Image Artist (image analysis platform, see step 4.7).\nAfter imaging is complete, return cell models to the cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. However, omit cell models used for viability analysis from further studies because of the live/dead reagent media on long-term viability.\nAnalysis of images on the image analysis platform\n\t\nSelect each plane of the Z-stack image in the software. Combine plane images as a maximum-intensity projection image.\nCreate a new analysis by selecting the bioprinted model as a region of interest (ROI) by identifying fluorescence from the live cell channel at 488 nm (ensure all cells are selected under ROI).\nWithin the region of interest, use the imaging software to identify the number of cells in the ROI through the nuclear stain channel (405 nm), the number of live cells in the ROI using the 488 nm channel, and the number of dead cells in the ROI using the 647 nm channel.",
    "Run the analysis on all live/dead treated cell model wells and export the data table containing ROI area, total cell number, number of live cells, and number of dead cells.\nCalculate the number of live and dead cells as a percentage of total cell number per analysis day.\n5. Immunostaining and cell population analysis\nBefore fixation, remove media from the cell models and wash the models once in PBS.\nFix cells with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at RT for 20 min.\n\tCAUTION: All work with paraformaldehyde must be carried out according to laboratory procedures.\nAspirate 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde solution from the models and wash the models four times in PBS to completely remove paraformaldehyde.\nPermeabilize the cell models with 0.2% triton-X for 30 min at RT and wash three times with PBS.\nBlock the cell models using 10% (v/v) normal donkey serum (NDS) for 3 h at RT.\nRemove the blocking solution and add primary antibodies (diluted in 1% v/v NDS in PBS) to the models. If performing cell population ratio analysis (see step 5.11), ensure to include cell models that are co-stained for Β-III tubulin (with red AF647 conjugation) and GFAP (with green AF488 conjugation). Incubate models with primary antibodies for 24 h at 4 °C.\nAfter primary incubation, wash the models stained with conjugated primary antibodies three times in PBS and counterstain with 20 µM Hoechst for 30 min. Image as detailed in step 5.10.\nWash the models stained with unconjugated primary antibodies three times in PBS and add secondary antibodies (diluted in 1% v/v NDS in PBS). Incubate for 24 h at 4 °C.\nRemove secondary antibodies by washing three times in PBS, and counterstain models with 20 µM Hoechst for 30 min before imaging.",
