    "1. Production of Dorsal Substrates\nProduction of a flat film of PLLA by solvent casting.\n\t\nWork in a fume hood to prepare a solution of 2% (w/v) PLLA in chloroform (2 g PLLA in 100 ml chloroform) by stirring at room temperature (RT) until completely dissolved (3 hr approximately).\nPlace the washers on a glass Petri dish.\n\t\tNote: Use stainless-steel washers with an inner diameter of 10.5 mm (slightly smaller than the ventral sample diameter) so that the washer is placed on top of the ventral substrate. Other materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or glass washers could be used as well.\nAdd 200 µl of the PLLA solution in the washer and let evaporate slowly for 30 min at RT. In order to allow slow evaporation of the solvent, close the Petri dish with aluminum foil with a few holes.\nHeat the samples at 120 °C for 5 min in order to evaporate solvent traces.\nLet samples cool down at RT.\nOnce samples have cooled down (30 min approximately), cover with 18.2 MΩ·cm water in the Petri dish and incubate for 8 min at RT.\n\t\tNote: If samples are not completely cooled down, they may take up 18.2 MΩ·cm water and adopt a rubbery state. Additionally, incubating in 18.2 MΩ·cm water for less than 8 min may result in improper detachment, and for more than 8 min in detachment from the washer.\nWith a razor blade, pry the washers to peel them off the Petri dish.\nRemove any imperfections from the edge of the washer with tweezers and let the samples air-dry.\nStore the samples in a vacuum desiccator (80 mbar) until the day of the experiment because PLLA is degradable by hydrolysis. \nProduction of PLLA fibers by electrospinning.",
    "Work in a fume hood to prepare a solution of 8% (w/v) PLLA in hexafluoroisopropanol (8 g PLLA in 100 ml hexafluoroisopropanol) by stirring at RT till completely dissolved (3 hr approximately).\nPlace the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) washers on an aluminum sheet or on a drum for the electrospinning in order to get random or aligned fibers respectively.\n\t\tNote: Use polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) washers with an inner diameter of 10.5 mm (slightly smaller than the ventral sample diameter) so that the washer is placed on top of the ventral substrate. Other materials such as stainless steel or glass washers could be used as well. The drum should rotate at an angular velocity of 160.7 sec-1 (radius = 7 cm) in order to obtain aligned fibers. A slower speed might not trigger fiber alignment and a faster speed will result in broken fibers.\nLoad the syringe with the polymer solution and place it on the syringe pump.\nElectrospin the PLLA solution using a 0.9 ml/hr flow rate with a voltage of 30 kV and a collector distance of 12 cm.\nStop the electrospinning process after 20-30 min, once a good fiber density is achieved (since cells have to interact with several fibers simultaneously).\nHeat the samples at 120 °C for 5 min in order to evaporate solvent traces.\nStore the samples in a vacuum desiccator (80 mbar) until the day of the experiment because PLLA is degradable by hydrolysis.\n2. Sandwich Culture\nAssemble the sandwich-like culture once cells are adhered to the ventral 2D substrate.\n\t\nWork in a culture hood to ensure sterile conditions and sterilize all materials (glass coverslips, dorsal substrates, tweezers, etc.) by UV exposure for 30 min.",
    "Coat the ventral and dorsal substrate with fibronectin in order to direct specific cell-protein adhesion. To do this, incubate the samples in 20 µg/ml of fibronectin dissolved in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (200 µl/sample) for 1 hr.\n\t\tNote: Due to the fabrication process, dorsal substrates have a designated top and bottom sides because the solvent casted film and electrospun fibers attached to one of the sides of the washer. This side is therefore the one facing the cells (Figure 3).\n\t\t\nAfter the protein coating, wash the samples twice with DPBS in order to remove protein in excess. Then incubate samples in DPBS until their use in order to prevent samples from getting dry since this causes protein denaturalization. Use DPBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ since divalent cations regulate protein folding.\nSeed cells on the glass coverslips13.\n\t\tNote: As the sandwich-like culture is based on 2D substrates, cell seeding will be performed similarly as on a 2D sample. For example, C2C12 myoblast are seeded at 17,500 cells cm-1 for differentiation experiments and NIH3T3 fibroblast are seeded at 7,000 cells cm-1 for isolated cultures to study cell morphology and adhesion.\nPlace the samples in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and allow cells to adhere to the ventral substrate for 3 hr.\nPlace the ventral seeded substrate in a new well of a 12 multi-well plate (where washers fit).",
    "Note: Assembling the sandwich-like culture in a new well is one way to get rid of the cells that have adhered to the bottom of the well after the seeding since these will consume nutrients and secrete growth factors and waste that influence cells cultured within the sandwich-like system. This is also a must for cellular extractions in order to lyse only the cells cultured within the sandwich-like environment.\nCarefully and with the help of a pair of tweezers, overlay the dorsal substrate on the cells. Refill with medium (1 ml) and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n\t\tNote: The weight of the washer will prevent the dorsal substrate from floating.\nChange the medium twice a week as in standard 2D cultures. Do not move the dorsal substrate since this could result in cell damage.\nAssemble the sandwich-like culture just after cell seeding.\n\t\nWork in a culture hood to ensure sterile conditions and sterilize all materials (glass coverslips, dorsal substrates, tweezers, etc.) by UV exposure for 30 min.\nCoat the ventral and dorsal substrate with fibronectin in order to direct specific cell-protein adhesion. To do this, incubate the samples in 20 µg/ml of fibronectin dissolved in DPBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (200 µl/sample) for 1 hr.\n\t\t\nAfter the protein coating, wash the samples twice with DPBS in order to remove protein in excess. Then incubate samples in DPBS until their use in order to prevent samples from getting dry since this causes protein denaturalization. Use DPBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ since divalent cations regulate protein folding.\nSeed cells on glass coverslips in a well of a 12 multi-well plate (where washers fit). To do this, use a highly concentrated cellular suspension to avoid cell loss after laying the dorsal substrate.",
    "Carefully and with the help of a pair of tweezers, overlay the dorsal substrate on the cells. Refill with medium (1 ml) and incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n\t\tNote: The weight of the washer will prevent the dorsal substrate from floating.\nChange the medium twice a week as in standard 2D cultures.\n\t\tNote: Do not move the dorsal substrate since this could result in cell damage. \n3. Analysis\nNote: Sandwich-like cultures are based on 2D substrates, and so can be commonly analyzed by procedures already developed for standard 2D cultures. For example, since PLLA is transparent and cells are constrained to move within the x-y plane, microscopy is done as on 2D substrates. Cell migration can be therefore analyzed as for 2D cultures, without the need of tracking cells in the z-axis as for 3D cultures, which simplifies the experiment and image analysis. To study the wound healing assay by a scratch assay follow this protocol:\nStudy cell migration (wound healing assay) within the sandwich-like culture.\n\t\nWork in a culture hood to ensure sterile conditions and sterilize all materials (glass coverslips, dorsal substrates, tweezers, etc.) by UV exposure for 30 min.\nCoat the ventral and dorsal substrate with fibronectin in order to direct specific cell-protein adhesion. To do this, incubate the samples in 20 µg/ml of fibronectin dissolved in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 1 hr.\n\t\t\nAfter the protein coating, wash the samples twice with DPBS in order to remove protein in excess. Then incubate samples in DPBS until their use in order to prevent samples from getting dry since this could cause protein denaturalization. Use DPBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ since divalent cations regulate protein folding.\nSeed cells on the glass coverslips at a high density13.",
    "Place the samples in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and allow cells to achieve confluence.\nUse a pipette tip to scratch the cell monolayer in order to get 2 cell populations separated by a gap.\nPlace the ventral seeded substrate in a new well suitable for the time-lapse acquisition and where dorsal substrates fit (i.e. 12 multi-well plate).\nCarefully and with the help of a pair of tweezers, overlay the dorsal substrate on the cells and then refill with medium (1 ml for a 12 multi-well plate).\n\t\tNote: The weight of the washer will prevent the dorsal substrate from floating.\nPlace the sample in the time-lapse microscope (set to 37 °C and 5% CO2) and take images of the gap closure every 20 min.\nAnalyze the gap closure using specific software such as the plugin MiToBo from ImageJ.14\nNote: Protein and nucleic acid extraction is performed similarly as on 2D substrates. There is only one extra step that consists in disassembling the sandwich-like culture to add the lysis buffer directly on the cells in order to increase the extraction efficiency. For instance, for mRNA extraction:\nExtract mRNA from Sandwich-like Cultures\n\t\nPrepare all the buffers from the commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nTake the sandwich-like culture out from the incubator.\nRemove the culture media from the samples.\nWash the samples once with DPBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (1 ml) and remove all the solution.\nWith the help of a pair of tweezers, remove the dorsal substrate and add the lysis buffer (350 µl) to the ventral substrate. Overlay again the dorsal substrate on the ventral substrate in order to lyse also the cells adhered to the dorsal substrate.\nRemove the dorsal substrate to isolate the lysis solution.\nFollow manufacturer's instructions to get the mRNA.",
    "Note: Immunodetection of proteins can be also performed as on 2D substrates. Since sandwich-like cultures could hinder the correct diffusion of the antibodies and buffers, incubation times should be increased. Also, the sandwich can be disassembled before starting the staining protocol but in this latter case some cells will remain attached to the dorsal substrate and some to the ventral substrate.\nImmunodetect proteins within a sandwich-like culture\n\t\nWash the sample once with DPBS and fix with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C.\n\t\tNote: Dorsal substrate can be removed during the fixation process so that diffusion problems are avoided.\nRinse with DPBS (1 ml) and then permeabilize with 0.5% Triton X-100 in DPBS (1 ml) for 5 min at RT.\nBlock non-specific binding sites with 1% albumin in DPBS (1 ml) for 30 min at RT.\nIncubate with primary antibody (2 µg/ml; 1 ml) in blocking solution for 3 hr at RT.\nWash 3 times for 10 min with DPBS/0.5% Tween 20 (1 ml).\nIncubate 2 hr with secondary antibodies (2 µg/ml) and 1 µg/ml DAPI in blocking solution (1 ml) at RT.\nWash 3 times for 10 min in DPBS/0.5% Tween 20 (1 ml).\nWash in DPBS.\n\t\tNote: Samples can be mounted on a slide with Vectashield and sealed with nail polish when dorsal substrates are removed prior the immunodetection.\nObserve under the fluorescence microscope as for standard 2D substrates.\nSubscription Required.
