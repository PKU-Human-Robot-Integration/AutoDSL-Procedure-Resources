    "All animal procedures performed in this study were approved by the Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR) Animal Welfare Body (ORBEA, #9/2018) and complied with the Animal Care National and European Directives and with the ARRIVE guidelines.\n1. Experimental design\nPair-house 13 week old male Wistar rats in ventilated cages under controlled environmental conditions of temperature (22 °C ± 1 °C), humidity (50%-60%), and light (12 h light-dark cycle) and with ad libitum access to tap water and standard rodent chow.\nAfter a 2 week period of acclimatization, arbitrarily assign the rats into two groups.\nFeed the control (CTRL, n = 6) and high-fat diet groups (HFD, n = 6) with standard chow and a high-fat diet (45% kcal/fat), respectively, for 24 weeks.\nMonitor the body weight (BW) weekly. Record the food and beverage consumption daily per cage.\n2. Liver sample preparation\nLiver dissection\n\t\nPrepare the peristaltic pump: Run 70% ethanol through the tubing, connect a 27 G needle to the outlet end of the tubing, and prime the tubing with ice-cold (4 °C) 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH ~7.4 ) (e.g., 200 rpm on a peristaltic pump with 1.6 mm I.D. silicon tubing, IV mini drip set). Adjust for the body weight (e.g., for a 100-150 g rat, use a flow rate of approximately 10-12 mL/min).\nAnesthetize the rat by an intraperitoneal injection using an anesthesia protocol (the final concentration of ketamine = 75 mg/kg, and the final concentration of medetomidine = 1 mg/kg).\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the rat is completely anesthetized using the toe pinch response method.\nPlace the rat on the dissection tray.\nSanitize the fur thoroughly with 70% ethanol, and dry it with a paper towel.",
    "Using scissors, make a \"U\"-shaped incision through the skin, and cut open below the diaphragm. Then, cut the rib cage rostrally on the edges to expose the heart.\nWhile the 1x PBS is running, pass the needle through the left ventricle into the ascending aorta, and clamp. Then, the right atrium is cut to allow drainage once the perfusion has begun.\n\t\tNOTE: The liver should begin to blanch as blood is replaced with PBS.\nUsing scissors and Dumont forceps, remove the liver carefully, and rinse with 1x PBS.\nTransfer the liver onto a Petri dish, and weigh it.\nUsing a scalpel, collect hepatic tissue samples of 5 mm in thickness from the lateral side (1 cm from the edge) of the left lobe of the liver for the embedding process.\n\t\tNOTE The remaining tissue can be stored at −80 °C for long-term storage.\nLiver tissue embedding\n\t\nPrepare a dry ice container, and properly label cryomolds with the sample ID and orientation.\nPlace a few drops of cryo embedding matrix onto the center of the cryomold to make the optimal cutting temperature (OCT).\nEnsure the tissue sample is properly oriented for a transverse section.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that the side touching the bottom of the cryomold is the side that will be sectioned first.\nCarefully drop more OCT onto the cryomold until it is completely covered. Try to avoid the formation of air bubbles. If necessary, with plain forceps, remove any bubbles inside the OCT.\nRapidly place the cryomold with the OCT-covered sample in a dry ice container.\n\t\t​NOTE: The tissues can be stored at −80 °C for 3 years.\n3. Frozen tissue sectioning\nAdjust the cryostat temperature (chamber: −21 °C; specimen: −18 °C), and insert a new sterile blade.",
    "Place the samples in the cryostat for 30 min before allowing the temperature to equilibrate.\nMake a single layer of OCT on the specimen disc to allow sample adhesion. Allow the OCT to freeze, and mount the tissue sample in the desired orientation.\n\tNOTE: The cutting surface should be parallel to the blade. To maintain good adhesion, place the heat extractor on the top of the sample. The previous steps can also be performed in a dry ice container with dry ice.\nPlace the sample in the specimen head, and trim the surface of the tissue (a few 30 µm tissue sample sections).\nOnce the region of interest is accessible for sectioning, cut 12 µm thick sections, and place them onto labeled microscope slides kept at room temperature (RT).\n\tNOTE: To collect the section, slowly move the slide toward the tissue section. Each slide can collect two liver sections.\nAllow the slides to dry for 10 min at RT.\n\t​NOTE: The slides can be stored at −20 °C for 6-12 months or at −80 °C for up to 3 years.\n4. BODIPY staining\nThaw the slides in a slide staining system at RT for 30 min.\nWash with 1x PBS (3x for 5 min each).\nCircle the section with a hydrophobic layer using a barrier pen.\nPrepare 500 µg/mL BODIPY 493/503 stock solution: Dissolve 1 mg of BODIPY 493/503in 2 mL of solvent (90% DMSO; 10% 1x PBS). Protect from light. Sonicate in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h (9.5-10 W) at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: The solution can be stored at −20 °C for at least 30 days.\nPrepare the BODIPY staining solution (1 µg/mL) by adding 2 µL of BODIPY 493/503 stock solution and 0.1 µL of DAPI stock solution (5 mg/mL) to 997.9 µL of 1x PBS.",
    "Incubate the slides (75 µL/slide) with BODIPY 493/503 (1 µg/mL) and DAPI (0.1 µg/mL) at RT for 40 min.\n\tNOTE: Keep the slides in the dark from this step onward.\nWash the slides with 1x PBS (3x for 5 min each).\nMount the slides with coverslips using a fluorescence mounting medium, allow them to dry for 30 min, and seal them with nail polish.\n\t​NOTE: The slides can be stored at 4 °C until imaging.\n5. Lipid quantification\nMeasure the serum total cholesterol and TG levels using an automatic, validated method and equipment.\nMeasure the hepatic TG levels using a triglycerides colorimetric assay kit (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n6. Image acquisition\nPlace the slide on the laser scanning confocal microscope slide holder.\nFor image visualization and acquisition, use a confocal microscope with a 20x objective lens (plan-apochromat: 20x/0.8).\nTo avoid cross-talk between the BODIPY 493/503 and DAPI, use the sequential (best signal) scan mode on the confocal software.\nExcite the BODIPY 593/503 using the 488 nm argon laser line and the DAPI using the 405 nm laser line. Set the emission ranges at 493-589 nm for BODIPY 493/503 and at 410-464 nm for DAPI.\nUse the following settings: pinhole: 1 AU, resolution: 1,024 pixels x 1,024 pixels, bit depth: 12, pixel size: 0.415 µm, bidirectional mode, scan speed: 7 (~1.58 µs/pixel for a 20x objective), line averaging: 2x, and digital zoom: 1.\n\tNOTE: The abovementioned scanning parameters must be optimized for each confocal microscope and objective used.\nSet the gain and digital gain appropriately so that no saturated pixels are detected on the range indicator.\n\tNOTE: Correct the background signal by adjusting the offset.\nOnce the LDs are correctly identified, acquire the image with the BODIPY and DAPI channels.",
    "NOTE: All the pictures must be acquired in the same conditions (exposure and general settings) for each color channel.\nTo create wide-area images (Figure 2), change the objective to a10x objective lens (plan-neofluar: 10x/0.3).\nSelect Tile Scan mode, and make mosaics of 5 per 5 images.\n\tNOTE: In this work, each tile had an overlap of 10% in order to appropriately merge the tiles for analysis.\nTo create 3D and orthogonal views (Figure 3A), place a drop of immersion oil on the top of the cover glass, and change the objective to a 40x objective lens (plan-neofluar: 40x/1.30 oil).\nSelect Z-Stack mode, and by adjusting the Z plane, define the first and last positions for acquisition with an optical slice at an optimal thickness (~0.5 µm) to ensure that all the droplets are captured.\n\tNOTE: To speed up the image acquisition and avoid bleaching, the optical slice can be adjusted to a suboptimal size, ensuring at least 30% oversampling for a good 3D reconstruction.\nSelect the Ortho module, and create orthogonal views.\nAcquire 3D images by selecting the 3D module following Transparency Rendering Mode with the confocal microscope software.\n7. Analysis of images\nProcess and analyze the single-plane images (20x magnification) with CellProfiler (version 4.2.5).\n\tNOTE: The pipeline used in this work was adapted from Adomshick et al.45.\nClick on the Images module in the top-left corner of the CellProfiler window, and upload the images as .tiff files.\nUse the NamesAndTypes module to sort between BODIPY- (droplet) and DAPI- (nuclei) stained images based on the file names. Perform the LD analysis only with BODIPY-stained images.\nTo start the pipeline constrution, click on Adjust Modules, and select the module ColorToGray to convert the images to grayscale images.\n\tNOTE: To identify objects, grayscale images are required.",
    "Identify droplets by employing the IdentifyPrimaryObjects module using the grayscale image.\n\tNOTE: The parameters in this module must be adjusted to accomplish good LD identification. In this work, defining LDs with a size between 6 pixels and 300 pixels and a threshold correction factor of 1.0 led to the most accurate identification.\nTo measure the pixel intensity of the identified lipid droplets, add a MeasureObjectIntensity module.\nAdd an additional FilterObjects module to ensure that only the strongest signals are quantified while less intense signals are excluded from the final lipid droplet analysis (minimum intensity: 0.15; maximum intensity:1 arbitrary unit).\nTo measure the LDs related to the output data, add the MeasureObjectSizeShape module.\nAdd an OverlayOutlines module at this point to overlay the identified droplet on the original image and, thus, ensure that the segmentation looks accurate on the unprocessed image as well.\n\tNOTE: This is an optional (quality control) step.\nAdd an ExportToSpreadsheet module at the end, and click on the Analyze Images button at the bottom-left corner.\n8. Statistical analysis\nExpress the results as mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) using any statistical analysis software application.\n\tNOTE: In this study, GraphPad software was used for statistical analysis.\nAnalyze the distribution of values using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess significant deviations from normality. Analyze the parametric data using the Student's unpaired t-test.\n\tNOTE: Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nSubscription Required.
