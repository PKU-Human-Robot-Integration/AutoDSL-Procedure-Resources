    "The following protocol has been approved by the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and complies with all institutional ethical guidelines regarding the use of research animals.\n1. Creation of Abdominal Adhesions\nStart the mouse on antibiotic chow diet one week prior to the procedure.\nAutoclave the surgical instruments and pre-warm the saline irrigation solution.\nAnesthetize the mouse using 2% inhaled isoflurane.\nUsing a hair clipper followed by a quick application (5 - 10 sec) of depilatory agent, remove the hair from the majority of the surface of the abdomen. Thoroughly remove the depilatory agent by gently wiping with wet gauze and, optionally, by carefully dunking the lower half of the mouse into warm water. Thoroughly dry the animal.\nPlace the animal's snout into the anesthetic nose cone. During the entire surgery, carefully monitor the respiratory rate of the animal and titrate the anesthetic flow rate as needed.\nUse a warming device, such as a heating pad or a warming lamp, to prevent hypothermia.\nPrior to prepping the abdomen, secure the mouse with strips of tape placed above and below the abdomen to prevent the mouse from shifting during surgery. Disinfect the abdomen with betadine, then follow with 70% ethanol. Include as much area as possible in the prep, including the hair on the edges of the shaved area. Place a sterile drape over the mouse. (Figure 1)\nSubcutaneously inject 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine, or 3 µg for a 30 g mouse.\nMake the skin incision.\n\t\nStarting in the lower abdominal midline, grasp the skin with forceps and make a shallow vertical cut in the skin using sharp scissors.\nCarry the cut superiorly to the xyphoid with the scissors. Take care to enter only the skin.",
    "As the abdominal musculature is now visible covering the viscera, grasp the midline of the musculature with forceps and very carefully make a small cut into it using sharp scissors. Make sure not to accidentally cut into an abdominal organ.\nAfter entering the peritoneal space with a small cut and seeing the muscular layer pull away from the abdominal organs, extend the cut superiorly and inferiorly by inserting the scissors into the opening and carefully cutting in both directions. Extend the incision from the xyphoid superiorly to above the bladder inferiorly. (Figure 2)\nNow that the intestines are exposed, locate the cecum and gently exteriorize it. Avoid grasping the cecum with toothed or sharp forceps. Instead use an atraumatic forceps such as an Adson serrated forceps.\nAbrade the cecum with sandpaper.\n\t\nGently abrade the entire surface of both sides of the cecum with 100 grit sandpaper for 30 - 60 sec until the surface becomes less shiny and petechiae appear on the surface. If the surgeon is right-handed, it helps to orient the cecum with the tip facing to the right and drape the cecum over the surgeon's left index finger. (Figure 3)\nPerform the sanding gently, as it is easy to accidentally cause a perforation of the thin cecal wall. A small amount of grittiness should be felt as the sandpaper is moved along the cecal surface. If the sandpaper is felt repeatedly catching on the cecum, this will likely cause a tear in the cecal wall. Watch carefully to ensure that particles of sandpaper do not dislodge and remain in the abdomen, as this may cause excessive foreign body reaction.\nIf a tear in the cecal wall occurs, terminate the procedure and euthanize the animal.",
    "If a cecal blood vessel is sheared by the sandpaper and causes bleeding, hold pressure for up to two minutes with gauze. However, if bleeding persists after this time, place a figure-of-eight 7-0 monofilament suture around the point of bleeding. This will reliably stop the bleeding in almost all cases. Take care not to incorporate a large amount of cecal wall into the suture, as this risks causing necrosis of the involved part of the wall.\nInjure the right abdominal sidewall.\n\t\nUse a strip of sandpaper to abrade the peritoneal surface of the muscle of the right abdominal sidewall. Be more aggressive with the sanding here than on the cecum and continue until the entire surface of the right abdominal sidewall appears roughed up. Avoid sanding so hard that skin is visible through openings in the muscular layer. (Figure 4)\nUsing a Castro-Viejo needle driver, place between two and four figure-of-eight 4-0 silk stitches into the muscular layer of the right abdominal sidewall. Leave the tails about 5 mm long. Take care not to accidentally catch bowel wall into the suture. (Figure 5)\nUsing a 10 ml syringe filled with warmed saline, irrigate the intestines several times. Direct the stream of saline into the abdominal cavity to irrigate the interior as well. If the surface underneath the mouse becomes soaked, move the mouse over or replace the surface, in order to avoid hypothermia.\nUse a sterile gauze placed over the incision to soak up excess irrigation.\nTake a pinch of starch and sprinkle it onto the surface of the right abdominal sidewall and onto both sides of the cecum. (Figure 6)",
    "Make sure that there is no active bleeding. If there is, use a gauze sponge to apply pressure directly onto the point of bleeding until it stops. If the bleeding does not stop readily, place a hemostatic suture as described above.\nUsing the blunt end of the forceps and a finger, gently push the intestines back into the abdominal cavity. Position the cecum next to the sutures in the right abdominal sidewall in order to maximize adhesion formation.\nClose the abdominal incision.\n\t\nUsing 6-0 absorbable braided suture, place a running stitch into the muscular layer at the top of the incision.\nRun the suture down toward the bottom of the incision, bringing together the muscular layer. Travel by about 3 mm and take 3 mm bites with each new stitch. Take care not to accidentally take a bite of intestine while placing sutures.\nAt the bottom of the incision, leave a loop of suture from the previous bite and use this to instrument tie the suture. Cut the suture leaving 5 mm tails.\nRepeat the above three steps with 6-0 nylon monofilament suture to close the skin.\nAdminister a 20 ml/kg subcutaneous saline bolus (roughly 0.5 ml for a 30 g mouse).\nUsing a dry gauze, thoroughly dry the entire animal, as the dorsal fur tends to get wet during irrigation.\nLoosely wrap an adhesive dressing around the abdomen to cover the incision. Take care not to constrain the animal's legs or breathing mechanics with the dressing.\nCarefully monitor the animal as it recovers from anesthesia. Administer buprenorphine every 12 hr for 2-3 days after the procedure for pain control.\n2. Harvesting Adhesion Tissue\nWait a minimum of seven days after the initial surgery. Again, autoclave surgical instruments and anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane.",
    "Sterilize the abdomen with betadine followed by 70% ethanol. Shave and depilate additional hair from the right side of the abdomen so that the adhesion specimen containing skin will not be covered in hair, which makes histology more difficult.\nUse a left paramedian incision, since bowel is often stuck to the original incision. Starting at the lower end of the abdomen, about 5 mm to the left of the bottom of the original incision, grasp the skin with small toothed forceps and cut into the skin with sharp scissors. Extend this cut superiorly to the ribcage. (Figure 7)\nUsing scissors, cut into the muscular layer and after entering the peritoneal space, extend the cut to the top and bottom of the incision. There will be adhesive tissue causing the cecum and small bowel to adhere to the right sidewall of the abdomen and possibly also to the original incision. (Figure 8)\nUsing the scissors and starting on the edge of the incision, above the level of the cecum, start cutting into the abdominal wall in a circle around the area where the bowel is adherent.\nAlternating above and below the level of the cecum, gradually cut all the way around the adhesion and complete the circle, yielding an \"island\" of skin and abdominal wall adherent to the bowel. (Figure 9)\nAgain using the scissors, cut into the bowel and separate the adherent part from the rest of the bowel, yielding a sandwich of tissue that consists of skin and abdominal wall on one side, bowel on the other side, and adhesive tissue connecting the two in between. (Figure 10)",
    "Optionally, use a pointed scissors to sharply separate the skin from the abdominal wall muscle. For histology consider leaving the skin attached, but for digestion and cell isolation the skin can be removed. If the tissue will be used for histology, make sure to remove as much suture material as possible without excessively disturbing the adhesive interface. For digestion and cell isolation it is acceptable to leave the sutures in place as long as the tissue digest is filtered.\nAfter excising adhesion tissue, euthanize the mouse using a humane method approved by your institutional animal use committee. \nSubscription Required.
