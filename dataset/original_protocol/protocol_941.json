Incubate at 50°C for 10 min \\(or until the gel slice has completely\n  dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2–3 min during incubation to help\ndissolve the gel.\n4. After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the\n  mixture is yellow \\(similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If\nthe color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 μl 3 M sodium\nacetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn to\nyellow.\\(~400ul)\n5.

    "Note: If the DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications, such as\ndirect sequencing and blunt-ended ligation, let the column stand 2–5\nmin after addition of Buffer PE.\n10. Centrifuge the column in a 2 ml collection tube \\(provided) for 1 min.\n  Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless\nthe flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation.\n11. Place each MinElute column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To\n  elute DNA, add 10 μl water to the center of the MinElute membrane.\n\\(Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the membrane\nfor complete elution of bound DNA.)

Remove tube\\(s) of frozen JM109 High Efficiency Competent Cells from\n  storage and place in an ice bath until just thawed \\(about 5 minutes). Mix\nthe cells by gently flicking the tube. Avoid excessive pipetting, as the\ncompetent cells are extremely fragile.\n3.

Incubate for 1.5 hours at 37°C with shaking \\(~150rpm).\n  9. Plate 100μl of each transformation culture onto LB/ampicillin plates. If a\n  higher number of colonies is desired, the cells may be pelleted by\ncentrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 minutes, resuspended in 200μl of LB\nmedium, and 100μl plated on each of two plates.\n10. Incubate the plates overnight \\(16–24 hours) at 37°C. If 100μl is plated,\n  approximately 100 colonies per plate are routinely seen using competent\ncells that are 1 × 108cfu/μg DNA. Use of ultra-high- efficiency\ncompetent cells may result in a higher number of background colonies.\nLonger incubations or storage of plates at 4°C \\(after 37°C overnight\nincubation) may be used to facilitate blue color development.\n-DAY 3-\n7.
