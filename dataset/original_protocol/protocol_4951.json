    "ExtractionThe optical density (OD) of C. merolae liquid culture is measured by spectrophotometer at 750 nm. When the OD750 reaches 10, cells are diluted to yield an OD750 of approximately 0.5 in 350 ml MA2 medium (Kobayashi et al., 2010). Grow the cells under illumination with fluorescent white light (50 μM photons m-2 s-1) at 42 °C, bubbled with air supplemented with 2% CO2. After incubation for 16 h, measure the OD750, transfer the culture to 500 ml centrifuge bottle, and collect the cells by centrifuging with angle rotor at 3,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature. Gently resuspend the pellet in 350 ml MA2 medium containing 500 mM NaCl and further cultivate for 3 h under the same condition. Harvest the cells (OD750 = 0.8, containing about 2 x 107 cells/ml) by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C, discard the medium by decantation. Remove the remaining medium by pipetting. Dissolve the pellet in MA2 (1-2 ml) and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen (Video 1).Grind the frozen cell suspension to powder by a mortar and pestle (Video 1). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

Column is a tandem jointed ODS SP100, 250 x 4.6 mm, S = 5 µm.Perform isocratic separation by 50% methanol. Flow rate is 0.5 ml/min at 40 °C, and apply the samples in 10-50 μl. The peak of ABA was detected at retention time 7.1 min (Figure 1).Standard calibration curves were generated at 254 nm with ABA reference.Standard ABAs of concentration of 0, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 pmol/μl are prepared and applied to HPLC in 10 μl. HPLC analysis should be performed in triplicates.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128221334_1522.jpgFigure 1. HPLC separation of the C. merolae extract with ABA standard reference. Cells were treated with 500 mM NaCl for 3 h. The ABA standard reference and 500 mM NaCl treated cell extract were separated by HPLC with PDA. The absorption spectra of 0.2 mM ABA standard (left panel), 500 mM NaCl treated cell extract (center panel) and merged (right panel) are shown."
