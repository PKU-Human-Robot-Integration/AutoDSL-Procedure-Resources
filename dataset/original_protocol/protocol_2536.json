We recommend establishing at least 5 heterozygous to heterozygous breeding cages.\nPropagation of Bdnf-e6+/- mice.\nBreed mice carrying Bdnf-e6 mutant allele with WT mice.\nExtract offspring DNA: Cut offspring tail tip tissue at postnatal days 14–21. Use One Step Mouse Genotyping Kit (Vazyme, PD101-01) for DNA isolation and genotyping.\nCollect tail tissue to a sterile 1.5 mL centrifugation tube, add 100–200 μL lysis buffer (2% proteinase K) and incubate at 55°C for 8–12 h. Be sure that tail tissue is fully immersed in lysis buffer.\nCentrifugate 1.5 mL tube at 12,000 g for 2 min. Transfer supernatant to 0.25 mL PCR tube and heat at 95°C for 10 min to inactivate the proteinase K in lysis buffer. The lysate will be ready to use for genotyping PCR after 95°C heating.\nOffspring genotyping: Primers for genotyping are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. The conditions for PCR are set as follows. Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR product shows genotypes. Homozygous= ∼ 367 bp, Heterozygous= ∼ 566 bp and 367 bp, WT=∼ 566 bp (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2169-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Genotypes of Bdnf-e6 mice revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis\nObtain at least 5 male and 10 female Bdnf-e6+/- mice for breeding.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2169_1.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2169_2.csv\nEstablish 5–10 heterozygous to heterozygous Bdnf-e6 breeding cages.\nCo-house male and female Bdnf-e6 heterozygous mice in one cage. We recommend pairing 1 male with 2 female mice together to get sufficient pups from each breeding cage.\nWatch for female pregnancy and birth of pups.",
    "Inspect breeding cages daily. Normally female mice will be pregnant after 2–6 weeks of breeding cage establishment. If female mice are not pregnant after 8 weeks, replace the male mouse with a new one. Pups will be born after approximately 3 weeks of pregnancy.\nCritical: Bdnf-e6 mRNA is highly enriched in placenta tissue. However, whether lack of Bdnf-e6 in the placenta would affect fetal development has not been investigated. Therefore, we recommend experimenters not to use homozygotes for breeding purposes.\nExposure to environmental stress\nOption 1: Postnatal hypoxia\nTiming: 1 week (for step 4)\nThis section describes procedure for postnatal hypoxia environmental stress exposure.\nExpose female parents and offspring to hypoxia environment from postnatal day 4 to day 10.\nRemove male mice from the breeding cages. Place offspring with their female parents (in the original breeding cage, do not change bedding) into hypoxia chamber.\nMaintain hypoxia chamber at 10% O2. Monitor remnant N2 in cylinder from time to time via pressure gauge. Replace with a full N2 cylinder when the cylinder inner-pressure is at low level.\nSeparate offspring from their female parents to new home cages (raise male and female offspring separately) and genotype offspring at postnatal day 21–27.\nRaise offspring with their female parents in the original home cages to postnatal day 21–27 under normoxia environment. Separate male and female offspring to new home cages at postnatal day 21–27 (after weaning).\nGenotyping protocol is the same as steps 1b and 1c. Tag offspring with a serial number through toes truncation or ear tags.\nGroup house Bdnf-e6 homozygous male mice to adulthood for behavioral tests and further research.",
    "Critical: Replace the N2 cylinder in time before used up. Because the hypoxia chamber obtains O2 through outside air, the hypoxia chamber is not 100% air sealed. When the N2 cylinder is empty, the O2 level in the chamber will bounce back to normoxia level (21% O2). Normoxia period during postnatal hypoxia stress may lead to inconsistent or failure of schizophrenia modeling.\nCritical: Must remove male parent before exposing breeding cage into hypoxia environment. Male mice might eat pups under environmental stress.\nOption 2: Postweaning social isolation\nTiming: 4 weeks (for step 7)\nThis section describes procedure for postweaning social isolation as an environmental stress.\nRaise offspring with their parents in the original home cage under the normoxia environment by postnatal day 20.\nPlace Bdnf-e6−/− male offspring to each individual home cage from postnatal day 21–49. After isolation, these mice are ready for behavioral tests and further research.\nOption 3: Juvenile corticosterone treatment\nTiming: 3 weeks (for step 9)\nThis section describes procedure for juvenile corticosterone treatment as an environmental stress.\nRaise offspring with their parents in the normoxia environment to postnatal day 20. Separate male and female offspring from their parents to new home cages on postnatal day 21, respectively.\nFrom postnatal day 42–63, treat Bdnf-e6−/− male mice with corticosterone through drinking water (0.1 mg/mL). After corticosterone treatment, these mice are ready for behavioral tests and further research.\nDissolve corticosterone powder with 100% ethanol. Subsequently, aliquot and stock the solution in −20°C.\nAdd corticosterone into mice drinking water to achieve the final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL corticosterone and 1% ethanol. Control group mice are only exposed to 1% ethanol.\nFully cover drinking water bottle by silver paper and change every 3 days to prevent degradation of corticosterone.",
    "Note: Maintain the mice in a 12/12-h light/dark cycle, 22°C–26°C with sterile pellet food and water ad libitum under standard conditions.\nNote: By pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) test, we have confirmed that exposure of Bdnf-e6−/− male mice to postweaning social isolation or chronic treatment of corticosterone at juvenile can induce schizophrenia-like phenotype.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Similarly, we suggest experimenters to examine the PPI deficiency of this G×E model to confirm the development of schizophrenia. However, full syndrome of schizophrenia-relevant behavioral phenotypes (e.g., social novelty, social interaction, novel object recognition, and nest building deficiency) induced by postweaning social isolation, or juvenile corticosterone treatment, or other types of environmental stress combined with Bdnf-e6−/− genotype has not been firmly established. Considering the validated full syndrome of schizophrenia behavioral phenotype and strong clinical relevance, postnatal hypoxia is more appropriate to be used as the environmental stress if the research is meant to investigate the neural pathology and comprehensive behavioral abnormalities of schizophrenia. On the other hand, juvenile corticosterone treatment can be used for high-throughput testing (e.g., drug testing) to avoid the tedious process."
