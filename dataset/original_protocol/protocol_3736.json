    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCoating coverslips\nTiming: 1–2 h\nAdult cardiomyocytes have poor adhesion. Coating coverslips with laminin can enhance adult cardiomyocyte adhesion.\nPut an autoclaved 25 mm circular coverslip to a 35 mm dish by a fine-tip forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/660-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Coverslip coating\n(A) Put a 25 mm autoclaved coverslip into 35 mm dish with fine-tip forceps.\n(B) Add 100 μL laminin to the center of the coverslip for coating.\nAlternatives: Use the 35 mm glass-bottom dishes.\nCoat the coverslips with 100 μL 40 μg/mL laminin, carefully spread the laminin over the coverslip using the pipette tip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAlternatives: Add 500 μL laminin on the coverslips, moving plates backward and forward, then right to left to right, let laminin spread over the coverslip.\nNote: This step is not necessary for cell types that have strong adhesion.\nGently put the plate into a 37°C incubator for 1–2 h.\nCulturing cardiomyocytes\nTiming: 2–4 h\nCount cardiomyocytes (Tian X et al., 2020) using a traditional Hemocytometer, and dilute cells into 2.5 × 105 / mL with M199 culture medium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/660-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cardiomyocyte culture\n(A) A representative image of collected adult rat cardiomyocytes.\n(B)Add 200 μL counted myocytes on a coated coverslip for cultivation. Scar bar= 50 μm.\nNote: Appropriate cell number is very important for live-cell imaging. The rod-shaped cardiomyocytes are easy to cross and overlay together. Cell counter may not work on it.\nTake out the coated plate and discard laminin with a pipette.\nCritical: Do not let the coverslip dry. The dry laminin cannot be reactivated for cell attachment.\nAdd 200 μL cardiomyocyte suspension to the center of the coverslip, and the cells will automatically spread on the coverslip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Gently put the plate into a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, wait for 2–4 h, let cardiomyocytes attached to the coverslip.\nCritical: Appropriate cell number is very important for live-cell imaging. Too many will lead to a difficult observation of a single cell after proliferation under the confocal microscope.\nGently discard the 200 μL medium and add 2 mL fresh M199 culture medium; the non-adherent cells will be discarded, incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nPause Point: The plated cardiomyocytes can wait for up to 72 h to measure pH depends on the different treatments.\nSNARF-1 loading\nTiming: 2.5–3 h\nTake the dish out and add 2 μL 5 mM SNARF-1 AM into a well and mix well through gently moving the dish backward and forward 3 times.\nIncubate cells in media containing 5 μM SNARF-1 AM at 4°C for 30 min (Trollinger, et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: Successful load SNARF-1 for measuring mitochondrial pH requires mitochondrial localization of the fluorophore because the membrane-permeable acetoxymethyl (AM) ester form of carboxy SNARF-1 AM is also localized to the cytosol. To distinguish mitochondria, it is better to stain the mitochondria with a mitochondrial-specific fluorescent probe, MitoTracker Green molecular probe.\nAlternatives: Incubation of SNARF-1 AM at room temperature for 45 min.\nDiscard the medium with SNARF-1 AM, and equilibrate myocytes with 2 mL KHB solution at room temperature (23°C–26°C) for 1.5 h.\nAdd 1 ul 200 mM MitoTracker Green molecular probe into the dish and mix well through gently moving dish backward and forward 3 times, and incubate at 37°C for 30 min for co-staining mitochondria.\nNote: The anion transporters in the plasma membrane can transport negatively charged, cytosolically localized SNARF-1 AM fluorescent dyes out of cells (Takahashi et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nCalibration mitochondrial pH by confocal imaging\nTiming: 1–1.5 h",
    "Take off the magnetic top of the Quick Release Magnetic chamber, apply the high vacuum grease around the inside pedestal evenly of the Magnetic bottom (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/660-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Prepare cell for the confocal image\n(A) Put the culture cells to a grease sprayed magnetic image chamber with fin-tip forceps.\n(B) The ready myocytes on the imaging chamber.\nUsing fine-tip forceps to pick the coverslip up, put it on a Kimwipes cleaning paper to dry the bottom of the coverslip.\nPlace the coverslip into the magnetic bottom of the chamber and put the magnetic top back to fix the coverslip (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: To maintain the coverslip's integrity, don’t use the fine-tip forceps to press the coverslip. It will make the coverslip broken easily.\nAdd 1 mL pH7.0 calibration solution with a pipette into the chamber and equilibrate 5 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: Put the imaging chamber on a Kimwipes cleaning paper to check the leakage.\nCritical: Steps 15 and 16 must be performed quickly (20–40 s) and carefully. Otherwise, adult cardiomyocytes will eventually shrink and die after leaving the solution too long.\nAdd one drop of oil on the 63× objective, place the chamber on the microscope stage above the objective.\nFind and focus the cell sample in the eyepieces, and move it to the center field of vision.\nSet the imaging parameters of Zen software, the emission spectra of SNARF-1 AM were collected by excitation at 543 nm using the Lambda scan mode of the Zeiss LSM 880. SNARF-1 AM emission fluorescence was collected at 545–750 nm.Images were acquired at 1024 × 1024 resolution. Gain 450–600; Pinhole 50–200; laser 5%–8%.",
    "Discard the calibration solution in chamber on the stage, wash one time for 2 min with 1 mL pH 7.4 calibration solution, add 1 mL pH7.4 calibration solution and equilibrate 5 min to the emission spectra of SNARF-1 AM.\nRepeat steps 18–20 three times till the emission spectra of SNARF-1 AM in pH8.0, 8.5, and 9.0 are collected.\nMeasure mitochondrial pH by confocal imaging\nSet the imaging parameters of Zen software: Dual excitation images of MitoTracker Green probe and SNARF-1 AM were taken by sequential excitation at 488 nm and 543 nm. MitoTracker Green probe fluorescence was collected at 505–545 nm. SNARF-1 AM fluorescence was collected at 545–600 nm (S1) and >615 nm (S2). Images were acquired at 1024 × 1024 resolution. Gain 450–600; Pinhole 50–200; laser 5%–8%.\nSet cells in the chamber for imaging follow steps 13–15, add pH7.4 KHB solution.\nFind and focus the cell sample in the eyepieces, choose only 488 channel to pre-setup relevant imaging parameters by the live scan (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/660-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. A representative image of 1-day culture cardiomyocytes\n(A) Bright filed image of myocytes.\n(B) Myocytes loaded with MitoTracker green.\n(C) Merged image. Scale bar=20 μm.\nChoose the rod cardiomyocytes with a clear mitochondrial pattern to start acquiring 2D images (interval 30 s).\nAfter 4th frame is taken, add 10 mM NH4Cl to the calibration solution and wait automatic image taken.\nAfter 14th frame is taken, add 300 nM FCCP to the calibration solution and wait automatic image taken.\nStop acquisition after 23th frame is taken and save images.\nAnalyze images\nUse the ZEN software to get the S1(580 nm) and S2 (640 nm) intensity of mitochondrial SNARF-1 AM (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/660-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. The screenshots for the image analysis\nOpen the Zen software and chose ‘ZEN image processing’.",
    "Open the cell image and chose the ‘Profile’ button (green arrow indicated).\nZoom in the image.\nChose the specific mitochondrion with the definition tool (Red arrow indicated), then the intensity of mitochondria will be displayed in the left panel(Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nExport these data and calculate the mean of S1 and S2.\nTo calculate the mitochondrial pH, the S1 would be divided by S2 (S2/S1 ratio) and calculated according to the correlated calibration line (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/660-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.
