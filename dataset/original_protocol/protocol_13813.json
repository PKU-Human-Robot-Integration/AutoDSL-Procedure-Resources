    "Animal care and all experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Ethics committee of the University of Munich, and all the procedures undertaken on mice were approved by the Government of Bavaria, Munich, Germany (ROB-55.2-2532.Vet_02-16-106, ROB-55.2-2532.Vet_02-19-86). C57BL6/J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory.\nNOTE: Figure 1 shows the instruments needed for the experiment. Figure 2 shows an illustration of the gross cardiac anatomy. Figure 3 shows the location of SAN and AVN in an adult mouse heart. Figure 4 shows the prepared sample loaded on the confocal microscopy.\n1. Preparations\nPrepare a 4% formaldehyde solution (4% PFA) by diluting 10 mL of 16% formaldehyde solution in 30 mL of PBS.\nPrepare a 15% sucrose solution and 30% sucrose solution by dissolving 15 g and 30 g of sucrose powder into 100 mL PBS, respectively. After the sucrose powder is fully dissolved, filter the solution using 0.2 µm syringe filter before storing at 4 °C.\nPrepare a 3%-4% agarose gel, add 3 g or 4 g agarose powder and 100 mL of 1x TAE (diluted from 50x TAE stock solution) into a beaker. Place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer and boil it until the agarose is completely dissolved.\nPrepare the dissection dish by gently pouring 30 mL of agarose gel (3%-4%) in a 100 mm diameter Petri dish. Leave the Petri dish on the bench at room temperature to cool down and harden.\nPrepare blocking solution and washing solution according to the recipes provided in the Table 1. Prepare all of the solutions prepared at the day of use. Long term storage is not recommended.",
    "Prepare the antibody solutions by diluting them in cold (4 °C) 1x PBS, protect the dilution from light (e.g., by wrapping aluminum foil around) and keep dilutions on ice until used. Dilute the antibodies shortly before incubation. Avoid leaving the diluted antibodies at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: The appropriate antibody dilution should be tested with comparable tissue samples by performing a conventional immunofluorescent staining. Here, we tested the antibodies by staining frozen sections cut at a thickness of 10 µm.\n2. Organ harvest and tissue preparation\nAnesthetize the mouse by placing it into an incubation chamber connected to an isoflurane vaporizer. Set the vaporizer to deliver 4-5% isoflurane (96-95% oxygen, respectively).\n\tNOTE: Full anesthesia is confirmed by the loss of the postural reaction and righting reflex by gently rolling the chamber until the mouse is placed on its back.\nPut the mouse in a supine position on the surgical table. Place the mouse nose into an anesthesia mask connected to a modified Bain circuit with its inner tube connected to the isoflurane vaporizer. To maintain anesthesia, use 1-2% isoflurane in oxygen at a flow rate of 1 L/min. Scavenge away excess anesthetic vapor from the mouse via the outer tube of the mask and draw through a canister of activated charcoal, which absorbs the excess anesthetic gas.\nWhen full anesthesia is achieved, inject fentanyl for analgesia (0.1 µg/25 g body weight i.p.).\nWhen the toe-pinch reflex is undetectable, make a clear cut from the jugulum to the symphysis using iris scissors to remove fur and skin. Make another cut from left to right underneath the ribs using iris scissors to carefully open the abdomen.",
    "Life the xiphoid a little bit using curved forceps to allow cutting the diaphragm from left to right without injuring any organs. Cut the rib cage in a medial axillary line on both sides using iris scissors to flip it cranially and to allow access to the heart.\nCut the inferior vena cava and descending thoracic aorta at the level of the diaphragm using iris scissors. Puncture the heart with a 27 G needlein the area of the apex and then carefully push the needle into the left ventricle (LV). Gently inject 5-10 mL of ice-cold PBS into the LV to perfuse the heart.\n\tNOTE: The color of the heart should turn from red to gray indicating successful perfusion with PBS.\nCarefully lift the apex of the heart using a tweezer allowing to cut the large vessels and to remove the heart.\nExcise the heart by cutting the large arteries and veins as far away from the heart as possible to avoid any damage to the superior vena cava (SVC). Conserve the SVC since it will serve as important landmark during later processing.\nAfter heart removal, turn off the isoflurane vaporizer.\nPut the heart into a dissection dish filled with ice cold PBS under the dissecting microscope. After determination of the left/right and front/back of the heart, turn the heart around with the front of the heart at the bottom of the dish (to expose the large vessels that are located posterior).\nImmobilize the heart by putting little pinsthrough the apex and the left atrial appendage (LAA) into the agarose at the bottom of the dissection dish (Figure 2A). Using fine tweezers and scissors, carefully remove non-cardiac tissue around the SVC and inferior vena cava (IVC) (e.g., lungs, fat, pericardium) to expose the inter-caval region (Figure 3A).",
    "Remove the majority of the ventricles by cutting parallel the groove between the ventricles and the atria with the micro scissor. Preserve a small part of the ventricular tissue for the later loading on the Plexiglas ring.\nFor fixation and dehydration, put the sample (containing the atria, SVC and IVC) in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C.\nThe next day, transfer the heart to 15% sucrose solution for 24 hours at 4 °C.\nThe next day, transfer the heart to 30% sucrose solution for 24 hours at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: For the fixation and dehydration in step 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15, the samples are left at 4°C without further stirring or rocking.\n3. Whole-mount immunofluorescence staining\nWash the heart in 1% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS and block and permeabilize in blocking solution (Table 1) overnight at 4 °C.\nPlace the heart in a 1.5 mL tube and incubate with rabbit anti-mouse connexin-43 (dilution of 1:200) and rat anti-mouse HCN4 (dilution of 1:200) antibodies diluted with blocking solution for 7 days at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The optimal concentration of primary antibodies should be tested before using the datasheets as orientation. Other antigens of interest could also be stained in this step, as long as the host species of the primary antigen is different from the other ones. A higher concentration of Triton X-100 may help obtain more efficient antibody staining as demonstrated before10, but concentration might be determined individually.\nAfter 7 days, remove the solution containing primary antibodies using a pipetteand wash the heart with 1%Triton X-100 solution 3 times (each time for 1 h at room temperature on the orbital shaker).",
    "After washing, incubate the heart = with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat IgG (dilution of 1:200) and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution of 1:200) for 7 days at 4 °C.\nAfter 7 days, remove all the solution containing the secondary antibodies using a pipette. Then wash the heart using washing solution (Table 1) 3 times (each time for 1 h at room temperature on the orbital shaker).\nTo stain nuclei, incubate the heart in DAPI solution (10 µg/mL) overnight at 4 °C.\nOn the next day, wash the heart with washing solution 3 times (each time for 1 h at room temperature on the orbital shaker).\n\tNOTE: For the blocking, permeabilization, antibodies incubation and DAPI staining in step 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.6, leave the samples at steady state in the 4 °C, no stirring is required. The stained tissue could be preserved fully covered with washing solution at 4 °C and protected from light for a few days until imaging at the confocal microscope.\n4. Confocal microscopy\nPrepare Plexiglas rings and fill with plasticine (Figure 1). In the center of the plasticine a little groove is formed in the center for loading the heart. Make a shallow groove, as this would be easier to acquire a flat imaging plane, and to adjust the space and avoid air bubbles between the sample and the coverslips in step 4.4.\nUse the same heart sample for the imaging of both SAN and AVN sequentially. For SAN imaging, directly load the heart whereas for AVN imaging, perform microdissection before.\n\t\nSAN imaging",
    "Identify the SAN by anatomical landmarks: it is located on the dorsal side of the heart within the inter-caval region (the region between the superior and inferior vena cava). The crista terminalis (CT) is the muscle streak between the SAN and RAA.\nPlace the heart into the plasticine groove with the back of the heart facing up. Add PBS onto the heart to displace all air within the cavity until the heart is fully covered with PBS (usually a few drops of PBS are sufficient).\nUnder the dissection microscope, gently press the RAA, LAA and remaining parts of the left ventricle into the plasticine to fix the heart. Make sure that the whole inter-caval region and the crista terminalis could be clearly seen (not covered by plasticine). The area that will be imaged is shown in Figure 3A.\nAVN imaging\n\t\t\nAfter finish the imaging of SAN, recollect the same sample and subsequently use for the AVN imaging. For AVN microdissection, place the heart = on a dissection dish under the dissection microscope.\nOrient the heart with the right side facing up (including the remaining parts of the right ventricle). Put pins through the remaining part of the LV free wall (which is now at the bottom) to immobilize the tissue (Figure 2B).\nCut the remaining RV free wall upwards through the tricuspid valve and superior vena cava. Then flip the RV and RA away to expose interventricular and interatrial septum. (Figure 3B)",
    "NOTE: Pay attention not to damage the coronary sinus (CS), as it is an important anatomical landmark to find the triangle of Koch which then allows to localize the AVN. The CS runs transversely in the left atrioventricular groove on the posterior side of the heart, and the CS orifice opening is located between IVC and the tricuspid valve at the inferior part of the interatrial septum (Figure 3A and B).\nIdentify the triangle of Koch that can be found on the endocardial surface of the right atrium, bordered anteriorly by the hinge-line of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (TV), and posteriorly by the tendon of Todaro. The base is formed by the orifice of the coronary sinus (Figure 3B). Since this is the target region for AVN imaging, it needs to be clearly visible.\nTransfer the heart into the plasticine groove within the Plexiglas ring with the triangle of Koch clearly being exposed (i.e. not covered by plasticine). Gently press the tissue around the Koch triangle into the plasticine to fix the sample. Add PBS onto the heart to displace all air within the cavity until the heart is fully covered with PBS (usually a few drops of PBS are sufficient).\nApply silicone to the edges of the Plexiglas rings to allow covering the hearts loaded within the plasticine-filled Plexiglas rings with cover slips.\nGently press the back side of the plasticine to squeeze out parts of the PBS and to attach the heart to the coverslip while avoiding any air bubbles within the imaging area.",
    "NOTE: Make sure that the regions of interest are not folded and covered during pressing the back side of the plasticine. A flat imaging plane without sample overcompression is necessary for conserving the anatomy and for proper confocal imaging of the samples. For SAN, it is important to make sure the inter-caval region is clearly exposed. For AVN, the triangle of Koch should be fully exposed.\nPut the whole-mount staining samples up-side down on the platform of the confocal microscope. The exposed SAN/AVN attached to the cover slip is now on the bottom of the microscope platform (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: To take images, we use the Carl Zeiss LSM800 with Airyscan Unit and the software ZEN 2.3 SP1 black.\nChoose plate \"BP420-480 + LP605\" for the excitation of Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated anti-HCN4. Vary the master gain from 650-750.\nTake an overview image of the whole SAN and AVN region by using Tile Scan function. Then select the HCN4-positive region by clicking and adding a square on the overview image around the area of interest that will be scanned.\nCheck the parameters, including plates and master gain for the remaining channels (Alexa Fluor 488 and DAPI) of the confocal microscope and set as described in step 4.6.\nSlowly adjust the focus from top to bottom of the sample to preview the whole sample and to set the First and Last for the Z-stack range. Set an optimal interval for the Z-stack based on the thickness of the optical sample. We use an 20x objective, and 0.8-1 µm as the interval for Z-stack.\nAfter all the parameters are properly set, scan the whole area of the SAN and AVN.\nPerform 3D reconstruction of the images using software (e.g., Imaris version 8.4.2).\n\t\nSelect Images Processing | Baseline Subtraction to remove background staining.",
