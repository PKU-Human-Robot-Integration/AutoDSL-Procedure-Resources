    "Note: The following protocol was designed for isolating mononuclear cells from skeletal muscle from two adult C57BL/6J mice. Muscle preparation Decontaminate the tools for muscle dissection, including forceps, scalpels, and scissors, with RNaseZAPTM wipes and rinse thoroughly with double-distilled water (ddH2O). Decontaminate the procedure area by spraying with 70% ethanol.Prepare three 100 mm Petri dishes, each containing 10 mL DMEM-I (see Recipes). Place on ice for washing and trimming of isolated muscles. To collect dissected muscles from two mice, prepare two 50 mL Falcon tubes, each containing 5 mL of DMEM-I, and place on ice.Sacrifice a mouse by cervical dislocation or CO2 asphyxiation and spray 70% ethanol over the entire mouse. Incise the skin at the ankle and peel off the skin from the hind limb. Dissect out all muscles surrounding the femur, tibia, and fibula (Figure 1A), and place into the 100 mm dishes containing DMEM-I. Cut out the fat, blood vessels, and tendons under a dissection microscope. Collect the trimmed muscles in the 50 mL Falcon tube containing DMEM-I; weigh the tube before and after sampling and record the muscle weight. Two hind limbs from an adult mouse provide approximately 1 g of muscle. Collect the muscles from the second mouse following the same procedure.Cut and slice the harvested muscles with scissors on ice, leaving 1–2 mL of DMEM-I on the Petri dish and removing the rest. Holding one end of a piece of muscle with forceps, use the scissors to cut the muscle into small pieces (approximately 1 mm3 fragments). After cutting, gather all the muscle pieces in the center of the dish and mince with scissors for an additional 2–3 min [Figure 1B (a)].",
    "Mononuclear cell isolation Transfer the minced muscle tissues from one mouse into two C-tubes containing the enzyme mix (5 mL each) and close the tubes tightly.Mount the C-tubes onto the GentleMAC Octo Dissociator with heaters [Figure 1B (b)]. Choose the 37C-mr-SMDK-2 program. Start the digestion, which takes approximately 1.5 h.After digestion, briefly centrifuge the C-tubes [Figure 1B (c)]. At this step, combine the two C-tubes containing muscle suspensions that were dissected from the same mouse (5 + 5 = 10 mL) into one tube. Use a 10 or 15 mL syringe and a 20G blunt needle (pre-washed with 70% ethanol and distilled water or with DMEM-I) to slowly aspirate and eject the muscle suspension 10 times. Eject the suspension toward the wall of the tube to avoid foaming. This step further breaks down the tissue debris and increases cell yield.Add 10 mL of DMEM-II to each suspension to dilute and deactivate the enzymes. Pipette the suspension onto a cell strainer (50 µm mesh size) and collect the flowthrough into a 50 mL Falcon tube. Wash each strainer with 10 mL of DMEM-II twice. Use a 200 µL pipette to collect any remaining liquid from the underside of the strainer. Each tube will contain 40 mL cell suspension.Discard the strainer and centrifuge the cell suspension at 600 × g for 15 min at room temperature. A clear pellet will be visible at the bottom of the tube [Figure 1B (d)]. Discard the supernatant completely. Dissolve the pellet in 1 mL DMEM-II and transfer to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.Centrifuge at 500 × g and 4 °C for 10 min in a bench-top centrifuge. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.5 mL cold PBS. Place on ice.",
    "Debris removal Note: This step efficiently removes fiber debris from the digested skeletal muscles and significantly improves the purity of mononuclear cells (Figure 1C). Carefully transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 5.7 mL of cold (4 °C) PBS (0.5 mL of cell suspension + 5.7 mL of PBS = 6.2 mL).Add 1.8 mL of cold debris removal solution; mix well by slowly pipetting up and down 10 times using a 10 mL pipette.Slightly tilt the tube and very slowly and gently overlay the cell suspension with 4 mL of cold PBS. Ensure that the PBS and the cell suspension phases do not mix.Centrifuge at 3,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant completely; this contains tissue debris [Figure 1C (a)]. The cell pellet at the bottom contains the mononuclear cells [Figure 1C (b)].Add cold PBS to a final volume of 15 mL. Gently invert the tube three times. Do not vortex.Centrifuge at 1,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant completely.Resuspend cells in 0.5 mL of PEB (see Recipes) by pipetting gently and slowly. Place on ice.Red blood cell lysis Make 10 mL of 1× red blood cell lysis solution by diluting 10× lysis solution with double-distilled water (ddH2O). Do not use deionized water (including deionized DEPC water). Store at room temperature.Mix one volume of cell suspension with 10 volumes of 1× red blood cell lysis solution (e.g., 0.5 mL of cell suspension + 5 mL of 1× lysis solution) in a 15 mL tube. Vortex for 5 s and incubate for 2 min at room temperature. Longer incubation may damage the cells.Centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min at room temperature [Figure 1C (c)]. Discard the supernatant completely and resuspend the pellet in 0.",
    "5 mL of PEB. Place cells on ice.Mix 5 µL cells with 5 µL of Trypan Blue and count the number of cells using the CountessTM machine. Approximately two million live mononuclear cells can be obtained from a mouse using the above procedure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4561/bioprotoc-12-23-4561-g001.jpgFigure 1.

(C) Debris removed by the debris removal solution (a), cell pellet after debris removal (b), cell pellet after red cell removal (c), and cells after sorting (d, 20× brightfield image).Flow cytometry analysis of isolated mononuclear cells For analytical studies, evenly divide approximately two million cells into nine 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (50 μL in each), including a tube with unstained live cells, a tube with heat-induced dead cells, and tubes with isotype controls, single antibody controls, or combined antibodies. Add viability dye eFluor 780, Fc blocker, isotype control, or antibodies to each tube as explained below.Procedures for staining Immunofluorescence staining for surface marker proteins enables us to identify specific immune cell populations. To confirm the enrichment of macrophages, we stained using three antibodies that recognized leukocytes (CD45), myeloid lineage cells including macrophages (CD11b), and M2 macrophages (CD206). See Table 1 for reagent combination.Add 50 µL of PEB to tube 1 (unstained) and place on ice.Incubate tube 2 at 65 °C for 10 min to generate the dead cell control. Subsequently, add 950 µL of PEB to bring the volume to 1 mL. Place on ice.Add 950 µL of PEB to the remaining tubes to bring the volume to 1 mL.",
    "Add 1 µL of viability dye (eFluor 780) to tubes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 (tubes 3, 5, and 7 are IgG isotype controls). Mix immediately by inverting the tubes 5–10 times. Incubate for 10 min at 4 °C.Centrifuge tubes 3, 5, 7, and 9 at 500 × g for 5 min, discard the supernatants, and resuspend in 1 mL of PEB. Centrifuge tube 2 at 12,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of PEB. Place tube 2 on ice.Add 1 µL of Fc blocker to tubes 3–9 and gently vortex for 1 s; repeat three times. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature (~25 °C).Centrifuge tubes 3–9 at 500 × g and 4 °C for 5 min. Discard supernatants and resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of PEB.Add 1 µL of IgG-PE, 1 µL of IgG-APC, or 1 µL of IgG-FITC to tubes 3, 5, and 7, respectively.Add 1 µL of CD11b-PE antibody, 1 µL of CD45-APC antibody, or 1 µL of CD206-FITC antibody to tubes 4, 6, and 8, respectively (tubes 4, 6, and 8 are for compensation). Add 1 µL of CD11b-PE, 1 µL of CD45-APC, and 1 µL of CD206-FITC to tube 9. Gently vortex for 1 s and repeat three times. Incubate for 40 min at 4 °C.Centrifuge tubes 3–9 at 500 × g and 4 °C for 5 min, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of PEB. Gently vortex for 1 s and repeat three times.Spin down tubes 3–9 at 500 × g and 4 °C for 5 min, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100 µL of PEB. Cells are ready for flow cytometry analysis.",

Flow cytometry analysis of isolated mononuclear cells. (A) Isolated mononuclear cells from young and old skeletal muscle were gated in a Forward/Side scatter plot. (B) Gated cells (from A) were further analyzed for CD45 and CD11b expression. CD45+/CD11b+ cells were separated from the main cell population (left, gate Q6). The double-positive cells accounted for 7.58% of the total cells in the young preparations and 6.28% in the old preparations (left). CD45+ cells accounted for 9.87% of the total cells in the young preparations and 8.24% in the old preparations (center). CD11b+ cells accounted for 9.21% of the total cells in the young preparations and 7.15% in the old preparations (right). CD11b+ cells were clearly separated from the main population and almost all CD11b+ cells were CD45+. (C) Putative M2 macrophage marker CD206 was highly expressed (gate Q2) in 27.7% of CD11b+ cells (gates Q2+Q3) in the young preparations (left) and in 32.1% of CD11b+ cells in the old preparations (right). BD FACSCantoTM II cell analyzer and FlowJo 10 software were used for analysis."
