Therefore, the choice of potential gRNAs is frequently limited.\n      On the other hand, gRNA selection for KOs is more flexible. In most cases,\n      KOs can be generated through introduction of a single double-strand break\n      (DSB) with a single gRNA or by using two gRNA near each other. Following\n      DSB, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) leads to random indel formation,\n      with potential frame shift and, as a result, a premature stop codon\n      occurrence or nonsense protein sequence. For a successful knockout, gRNA\n      target sites must be in exons critical for protein function. Specifically,\n      gRNA-target sequences near the N-terminus should be excluded to avoid\n      usage of an alternative start-site downstream of the annotated start\n      codon. Similarly, gRNA-target sequences near C-terminus ought to be\n      avoided, to maximize the chance of frame shifts and generation of a\n      non-functional protein.\n    \n      We suggest using Benchling[href=https://www.benchling.com] and/or\n      CRISPOR[href=http://crispor.tefor.net/] online tools for gRNA\n      design for all applications. However, when a non-targeted KOs is required,\n      we recommend the more straightforward\n      Synthego[href=https://www.synthego.com/products/bioinformatics/crispr-design-tool]\n      tool. The following steps describe design of gRNAs using online tools.\n    \nNote: As online tools change constantly\n      and rapidly, we provide just an overview of the steps. Most online tools\n      are self-explanatory and interactive. We encourage the users to explore\n      the manuals and FAQ sections to find additional information. Below we\n      describe design of gRNAs to create indels, and SNPs insertion in SORCS1\n      gene in Benchling.",

This tool maximizes\n      knockout probability by targeting an early part of the gene in an exon\n      common to all transcript variants. All gRNAs are ranked according to their\n      descending on-target activity and ascending off-target potential. In\n      principle, one gRNA is sufficient to efficiently introduce an indel.",
    "However, in silico tools are still limited in predicting the\n      cutting efficiency of gRNAs.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Therefore, we\n      recommend choosing 3–4 top scoring gRNAs and testing them in vitro.\n    \nSelection of gRNAs\nTiming: 30 min\n      We recommend selecting multiple gRNAs in the proximity of the desired\n      modification. For KOs, up to 4 gRNAs can be used at the same time to\n      increase the chance of indel formation. For KIs, use of 2 gRNAs\n      simultaneously can increase probability of HDR.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\n      However, increasing number of gRNAs also increases potential off-target\n      effects and in case of KIs can require introduction of additional silent\n      mutations in the repair template. Therefore, the number of gRNAs used per\n      modification should be carefully considered and will depend on the\n      specific gene and targeted region. In the section\n      delivery of CRISPR components to iPSCs[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8], we describe\n      delivery of 1 or 2 gRNAs.\n    \n        For KI, assess all the gRNAs in the proximity to the position/SNP you\n        aim to modify.\n      \n        Select 2 gRNAs that (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B):\n        \nhave high on-target score;\nhave minimal off-targets;\n            the CRISPR site (guide sequence and PAM) overlaps the desired\n            nucleotide change preferably in the seed region (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) of the guide RNA (1–10 bases upstream of the PAM site;) or in\n            one of the two G residues of the ‘NGG’ PAM site.\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2872-Fig2.jpg\n                  Figure 2.

    "For KOs, select gRNA as in steps 15a-b and:\n        \n            A or T at the 4th position upstream of the PAM;\n            \nNote: this will increase the\n              probability of A or T duplication.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\n            G at 1st position upstream of the PAM sequence;\n            \nNote: gRNAs with G at 1st position\n              have higher cutting efficiencies as compared to gRNAs with T at\n              this position.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\n            high out-of-frame and indel scores, if available in the online tool.\n          \nNote: It is not always possible to fulfil\n      all the above criteria for gRNAs.\n    \nCritical: If the SNP is located\n      outside of the seed region or corresponds to the ‘N’ of the ‘NGG’ PAM\n      site, then the modified allele after HDR will be subject to re-cleavage by\n      Cas9 RNP. Therefore, silent mutations should be introduced to either seed\n      sequence or PAM sequence in the single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide\n      (ssODN) template to prevent recutting. When these additional mutations are\n      not introduced, the number of screened clones needed to obtain the wanted\n      modification can increase substantially. For details see section:\n      design of ssODN for KIs[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4].\n    \nDesign of primers\nTiming: 30 min\n      As each hiPSC line is derived from an individual donor, there is a high\n      probability of SN variations (SNV) occurrence in any given DNA region (Figure S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2872-Mmc1.pdf]). Therefore, we recommend performing Sanger sequencing of the\n      PCR-amplified targeted region before proceeding with gRNAs and ssODNs\n      ordering. The primers used for this initial query can also be used for the\n      future verification of the gene editing success and for clone screening.\n    \n        Select approximately 250bp up- and downstream sequences from the target\n        site.\n      \nNote: Large deletions that expand past the\n      fragment covered by the primers are possible as described by Simkin\n      et al.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Therefore, it might be required\n      to use a primer pair spanning a larger region around target site. However,",
    "generation of hemizygotes rather than homozygotes is less likely to occur\n      when RNPs are used, rather than plasmids.\n    \n        Use Primer Blast design tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/]) to design primers that will amplify 400–450bp of DNA with cut site\n        position as close to the middle.\n      \n        Select and order two primer pairs (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1],\n        Figures S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2872-Mmc1.pdf]A–S1B).\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_2872_1.csv\nNote: To accurately estimate gene editing\n      efficiencies and further select edited clones the quality of the PCR\n      product and Sanger sequencing must be high. Therefore, we recommend\n      choosing at least two primer pairs.\n    \nDesign of ssODN for KIs\nTiming: 30 min\n      To facilitate specific SNP insertions, double strand breaks (DSB)\n      generated by Cas9 can be repaired by an endogenous cellular\n      homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway in the presence of donor template.\n      We recommend using single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) as HDR\n      repair templates. They can be synthetically produced, easily ordered, and\n      handled. The following steps describe the design of HDR template\n      recommended by Richardson et al.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12].\n    \nDesign HDR template 127nt in length.\nNote: increasing template length can\n      improve HDR efficiency, this decision should be made based on the gene\n      structure and desired modification, i.e., high repeat regions might need a\n      bit longer homology arms.\n    \n        We recommend HDR template to be asymmetric: 36nt distal homology arm\n        (HA) and 91nt proximal HA (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\n        Use target strand (non-PAM strand) as HDR template i.e., reverse\n        complementary to the gRNA sequence (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and\n        2B).\n      \nIf possible, mutate PAM sequence in ssODN.\nCritical: It is critical to prevent\n      Cas9 nuclease from recutting the modification site after the HDR. The\n      strategy will depend on the choice of gRNA and the SNP.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16],17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] For example, if the SNP to\n      be introduced already lies in the “GG” of the PAM, then additional\n      mutations might not be necessary, since the recutting post HDR will be",
    "limited. If not, a silent mutation of codons covering the PAM sequence\n      (one of the GG) should be introduced if possible; alternatively, the last\n      five nucleotides of seed sequence can be mutated to prevent gRNA from\n      binding.18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19],20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20],21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]\nBelow, we describe the design of ssODN using Benchling.\n        In the gene viewer in Benchling, select CRISPR icon on the right side\n        (crosshair icon).\n      \nSelect: Open HR template design and follow prompts.\nThe program will create the copy of the sequence.\n        Following the prompts in the right-side panel, insert the SNP sequence\n        to be knocked in.\n      \nAdjust the HA as described in step 22.\nClick Next.\n        The program will suggest mutations to the DNA template to prevent sgRNA\n        from binding and recutting.\n      \nNote: It is not always possible or\n      desirable to introduce additional mutations. When designing HDR template\n      without help of professional software (i.e., Benchling), we recommend to\n      consult codon usage tables when introducing silent mutations. For example:\n      https://www.genscript.com/tools/codon-frequency-table[href=https://www.genscript.com/tools/codon-frequency-table]\n        Select the non-PAM strand as donor template as described in step 23.\n      \nNote: Here we described template design\n      for introduction of 1–5 base pair changes. However, it is also possible to\n      introduce small tags using ssODN as templates. We have successfully\n      integrated double HA (∼60bp) and triple Flag tag (∼70bp) at endogenous\n      loci using ssODN templates. In these cases, the total template length was\n      extended to 140 and 170 bp respectively.\n    \nPCR optimization\nTiming: 8 h\n      Due to unpredictability of PCR efficiency at different genomic loci we\n      recommend testing both primer pairs designed in Steps 18–20 with at least\n      three different polymerases i.e., PHIRE, AmpliTaq, and/or Kappa2G, and/or\n      GXI polymerase, and/or Q5) at three annealing temperatures.

For\n        example, for each primer pair in SorCS1 exons 4 and 25 the clearest\n        bands were obtained with PHIRE polymerase with 62°C annealing\n        temperature (Figures S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2872-Mmc1.pdf]C–S1D).\n      \nRepeat the PCR with the chosen condition.\nPCR purify or gel extract the PCR product.\nNote: Choose any of the standard PCR or\n      gel extraction methods that provide sufficient purity for Sanger\n      sequencing.\n    \n        Perform Sanger sequencing on the PCR product with forward primer, the\n        same one used for PCR.\n      \n        Analyze the sequencing by comparing the obtained sequence with the\n        chosen genome reference.\n      \nNote: As hiPSC lines are derived from\n      various individual donors, it is not unlikely to find single nucleotide\n      polymorphisms which could interfere with gRNA binding sites (Figure S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2872-Mmc1.pdf]).\n    \nSynthesis of CRISPR components\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\n    \n      Once the target sequence is analyzed and no SNP interfering with the gRNA\n      and HDR template are detected, CRISPR components can be purchased.

This procedure allows\n      for faster turn over in case some of the clones have undesirable karyotype\n      profiles.\n    \n        Coat the receiving 6WP plate with Geltrex Coating Solution (see\n        materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\n      \nIncubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nPrepare StemFlex/CloneR2.\nNote: Volume of media needed is dependent\n      on the number of 96WP wells being thawed. For example, for 6 clones\n      prepare 12 mL of media.\n    \nAspirate Geltrex Coating Solution from the receiving plate.\n        Add 1.5 mL of StemFlex /CloneR2 to the wells of the receiving plate.\nOptional step: If the cells were not frozen after Step 104,\n        passage each well.\n        \nAspirate media from the well.\nWash the cells once with 100 μL of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0.\nAdd 100 μL of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0 to the well.\nIncubate at 37°C for 3–5 min.\nAspirate EDTA slowly.\nProceed with Step 125.\n        Remove 96WP from −80°C freezer and place it in 37°C bead bath or on the\n        prewarmed pad.\n      \n        Once Bambanker media in the 96WP starts to thaw transfer the plate to\n        the biosafety cabinet.\n      \nAdd ∼120 μL of prewarmed StemFlex/CloneR2 to the desired well.\nGently mix by pipetting.\nNote: each well should contain about\n      100 μL of Bambanker freezing media (see Step 113)\n    \n        Transfer the entire volume from one well of the 96WP to one well of the\n        receiving 6WP plate.\n      \nRepeat steps 126–128 for all desired wells/clones.\nIncubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 h perform ½ media change with StemFlex/CloneR2.\n        48 h after thawing, perform full media change with StemFlex media.\n      \nContinue media changes until the cells reach 70% confluency.",
    "Coat one full 6WP per clone with Geltrex Coating Solution (see\n        materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\n      \nPerform 1:6 cell passage using EDTA.\n        Continue daily media changes until the cells reach 70% confluency.\n      \n        For each clone, freeze the cells as described in step 81 (1 well per\n        cryovial).\n      \nCritical: Following gene editing\n      pipeline the resulting clones should be subjected to standard iPSC quality\n      control to ensure that no genetic abnormalities occurred during the\n      editing and cloning process. We recommend expanding the selected clone,\n      freezing a bank (∼50 vials) and performing SNP array analysis and\n      karyotyping to assess genetic stability. Whenever possible, we recommend\n      banking at least two edited clones. Additionally, a routine assessment of\n      morphology and expression of markers of undifferentiated cells should be\n      conducted. Confirmation of genetic modification by PCR and Sanger\n      sequencing or using NGS should also be performed on final bank. We also\n      highly recommend assessing the integrity of the 5–10 top off-target sites\n      for each of the gRNAs used."
