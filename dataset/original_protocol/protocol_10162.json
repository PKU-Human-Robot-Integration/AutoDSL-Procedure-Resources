    "1. HEVNP Production in Insect Cells\nNOTE: All following steps should be performed in a cell culture hood. Refer to our previous publication for more detailed HEVNP production procedures11.\nCulture Sf9 cells in insect cell media (see Table of Materials) to 50 - 75% confluence in 6-well plates.\nUsing insect cell transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's protocols, transfect Bacmids containing HEVNP-573C ORF2 into Sf99 cells to produce recombinant baculovirus. Incubate the transfected cells at 27 °C for 3 - 6 days, depending on the viability of cells.\nCollect supernatant at 3 - 6 days post-infection (after the transfected cells are lysed due to baculovirus infection) as P0 baculovirus stock.\nRemove culture medium before applying 200 µL of P0 stock to 50 - 75% confluent Sf9 cells in a 25 cm2 monolayer flask. Rock the flask every 15 min to ensure the full coverage of the inoculum. Repeat 4 times, for a total of 60 min.\nAdd 2 mL of insect cell culture medium to the flask and keep at 27 °C for 3 - 6 days, depending on viability of cells, to amplify baculovirus to a higher titer.\nCarry out plaque assays to obtain the baculovirus titer reading12.\nCulture the suspended Tn5 insect cells (Table of Materials) with 100 mL of insect cell medium in 250 mL flask and shake in 27 °C at 150 rpm to a titer of 0.5 x 105 - 1 x 106 for inoculation.\nAdd baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 - 10 to 100 mL Tn5 cells in a 250 mL flask. After inoculation, shake in 27 °C at 150 rpm for 5 - 7 days.",
    "Once most cells appear to have vesicles and 70 - 90% of cells are dead under optical microscope observation, collect the Tn5 cells and transfer into 33 mL ultracentrifuge tubes. Place the ultracentrifuge tubes in swinging bucket rotors, balance, and spin down the cell debris and recombinant baculoviruses at 10,000 x g for 90 min at 25 °C.\nKeep the supernatant that contains the released HEVNPs at 4 °C for further purification. For extended storage of baculovirus supernatant, add protease inhibitors.\n2. HEVNP Purification\nPellet and isolate the HEVNPs using cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient separation:\n\t\nTransfer the collected supernatant (from step 1.10) and add 20% NP-40 into each tube to make a final concentration of 0.5% NP-40 to dissolve any remaining cellular membrane. Gently mix by pipetting and incubate for at least 30 min at 25 °C.\nUltracentrifuge the HEVNPs at 112,400 x g in swinging bucket rotors for 2 h at 4 °C to pellet down the HEVNPs from the supernatant. Discard the supernatant after centrifugation and gently re-suspend the crude pellet in 200 µL of 10 mM MES buffer pH 6.2 in each tube overnight (O/N) at 4 °C. Run SDS-PAGE (step 3.1) to confirm the presence of HEVNP ORF2 in the crude pellet as a 52 kDa band.\nPrepare a 38.5% (w/v) CsCl gradient by mixing 1.96 g CsCl, the re-suspended crude pellet, and ~4 mL of 0.01 M MES pH 6.2 in a 5 mL ultracentrifuge tube. Balance the tubes and place in a swinging bucket rotor. Ultracentrifuge at 147,000 x g for 16 h at 4 °C.\nCollect the fractions after CsCl gradient:",
    "Discard the top 500 µL fraction, which is primarily light-weight cell membrane debris. Collect 500 µL fractions, starting from the top of the tube, and change tips in between each fraction. Place each fraction into numbered/labeled 1.5 mL tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: The presence of HEVNP ORF2 in fractions separated from CsCl gradient cannot be detected by running SDS PAGE gels due to the high concentration of CsCl. The CsCl in each fraction can be removed or diluted by following a CsCl clean-up procedure. Alternatively, the CsCl gradient can be replaced by a 10 - 40% sucrose gradient13 to avoid CsCl residual.\nTransfer each fraction to a 5 mL ultracentrifuge tube and dilute the CsCl with 4.5 mL of 10 mM MES, pH 6.2. Balance the tubes and place in a swinging bucket rotor. Ultracentrifuge at 147,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C to pellet down the HEVNPs.\nDiscard the supernatant and gently re-suspend the HEVNPs in 100 µL of 10 mM MES pH 6.2 in each tube. Cover the tubes to avoid evaporation and incubate O/N at 4 °C.\nRecord the A280 reading and A260/A280 nm ratio using a spectrophotometer. Determine the approximate concentration of ORF2 as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57020/57020eq1.jpg\n\t\tEach ORF2 will contain 1 Cys site and 1 Lys site for chemical conjugation.\n\t\tNOTE: The molar extinction coefficient of HEVNP ORF2 is 60,280, which is equivalent to 1.019 mg/mL × A280. This is so close to 1:1 that the concentration of HEVNPs (in mg/mL) can be approximated by the A280, and therefore, the concentration of ORF2 by the above equation. For example, an HEVNP with an A280 reading of 1 will have a concentration of 1 mg/mL, which is equivalent to 18.8 µM ORF2.",
    "Prepare an SDS-PAGE. Use a 6 µL sample from each fraction to determine the fractions containing 53.3 kDa HEVNP ORF2 protein (step 3.1). The HEVNPs should be found in fractions 3 - 5, with a density of ~1.25 g/mL.\nConfirm the presence and the purity of HEVNPs by TEM observation. Prepare or dilute the HEVNP samples to 0.5 - 2.0 mg/mL for TEM. The HEVNPs appear in TEM as empty icosahedral proteins, ~27 nm in diameter (Figure 2). Some protein contaminants may remain in the fractions and will be observed under TEM (step 3.2).\nIn the case that impurities are present under TEM, repeat step 2.1.3 - 2.2.6 for better purity of the HEVNPs.\n\tNOTE: Extra purification through CsCl gradient may cause yield loss of HEVNPs. Alternatively, the CsCl gradient purification can be replaced by a 10 - 40% sucrose gradient to avoid residual CsCl13.\n3. HEVNP Characterization\nPrepare SDS PAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Protein Gels, 1.0 mm, 17-wells (see Table of Materials) according to the user's manual14:\n\t\nAdd 2 µL of 4x loading buffer to 6 µL of protein sample. Incubate the sample mixture in a heat block for 10 min at 100 °C to denature the protein. Load the protein samples onto the gel.\nRun the SDS-PAGE by setting the DC power supply at 100 V for 10 min, then 150 V for 45 min until the samples run to about 1 cm above the bottom of the gel.\nStain the SDS PAGE gel with Coomassie blue (0.25% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, 30% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid), for 1 h.\nAfter the staining procedure, remove the Coomassie blue stain and apply de-staining buffer (30% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid) onto the protein gel for >12 h at room temperature.",
    "Document the gel under white light to confirm the presence of HEVNP ORF2 at the 52 kDa band.\nObserve the HEVNPs using TEM.\n\t\nPrepare or dilute the HEVNP samples to 0.5 - 2 mg/mL with 10 mM MES pH 6.2 for TEM imaging.\nIonize the carbon-coated grids with 40 mA glow discharge for 30 s to produce a hydrophilic carbon surface. The glow discharge equipment is described in the Table of Materials.\n\t\tNOTE: The hydrophilic carbon surface of the grids can only last for 30 min after glow discharge treatment.\nHold in tweezers and add 2 µL of HEVNP sample to the grid, wait for 15 - 30 s, and blot with filter paper.\nImmediately wash the grid with ddH20 and blot with filter paper.\nImmediately add 2 µL of 2% uranyl acetate to the grid, wait 15 s, then blot with filter paper. Dry the sample grids by putting them in an electronic dehumidify dry cabinet for O/N.\nTransfer the grid into a TEM and image at 10-80k magnification. HEVNPs appear in TEM as empty icosahedral proteins that are ~27 nm in diameter, due to the absence of viral RNA.\n4. Chemical Conjugation of HEVNPs with Biotin, Cancer Targeting Ligand, and Fluorophores\nPerform one step conjugation of HEVNPs and maleimide linked biotin.\n\t\nBuffer change: Apply the HEVNPs in mini dialysis units and dialyze against 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4 at room temperature for 1 h according to the manufacturer's protocol (Table of Materials). Transfer the HEVNPs to 1.5 mL tubes and measure the protein concentration at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer.",
    "Mix the HEVNP to 1 mg/mL, which is equivalent to 18.8 µM of Cys reaction sites (see details in step 2.2.4), with an equal amount of maleimide-biotin (100 µM) in 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4, to make a 1:5 molar ratio; react O/N at 4 °C. Remove unbound maleimide-biotin with a 40 K MWCO Spin Desalting column procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol (Table of Materials).\nAnalyze the samples through a standard reducing SDS-PAGE (step 3.1).\nUsing standard procedures, prepare a chemiluminescent Western Blot using HRP-linked Streptavidin. Capture the chemiluminescent signal by X ray film (Figure 2).\nPerform two step LXY30 conjugation to surface-exposed cysteine on HEV NPs (Figure 5).\n\t\nBuffer exchange: Apply HEVNPs in mini dialysis units and dialyze against 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4 at room temperature for 1 h. Transfer the HEVNPs to 1.5 mL tubes and measure protein concentration at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer.\nAdd 650 µM maleimide-azide and 650 µM alkyne-LXY3010 in 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4 with 200 µM CuSO4 and 1 mM ascorbic acid to form maleimide-linked LXY30 (Mal-LXY30) at 650 µM. Incubate the mixture at 4 °C for O/N.\nMix the HEVNP to 1 mg/mL, which is equivalent to 18.8 µM of Cys reaction site (see details in step 2.2.4), with about 10% volume of Mal-LXY30 (650 µM) in 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4, to make a 1:3 molar ratio; react O/N at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Due to the relatively high concentration of Mal-LXY30, the final concentrations of the reactants, such as CuSO4, are reduced about 10 times after mixing, to avoid their damage to HEVNPs. Another option is the Cu-free conjugation method15.\nRemove unbound maleimide-click-LXY30 with a 40 K MWCO Spin Desalting column according to the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials). Keep the LXY30-linked HEVNPs (LXY30-HEVNPs) at 4 °C.",
    "Perform one step conjugation of the LXY30-HEVNPs and Cy5.5 NHS ester (NHS-Cy5.5)\n\t\nMix the LXY30-linked HEVNPs (LXY30-HEVNPs) to 1 mg/mL, which is equivalent to 18.8 µM of the Cys reaction site (see details in step 2.2.4), with equal volume of NHS-Cy5.5 (100 µM) in 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4 to make a 1:5 molar ratio; react O/N at 4 °C.\nRemove unbound Cy5.5-NHS with a 40K MWCO Spin Desalting column procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials). Keep the LXY30, Cy5.5-linked HEVNPs (LXY30-HEVNP-Cy5.5) at 4 °C.\n5. HEVNP Binding to and Internalization in MDA-MB231 Breast Cancer Cells\nSeed MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells into a 35-mm glass bottom dishes (5 x 104 per dish) O/N in a mammalian cell culture cabinet.\nFor the cell binding experiment, prepare LXY30-HEVNP-Cy5.5 by following steps 4.2 - 4.3. Dilute the LXY30-HEVNP-Cy5.5 to 0.01 mg/mL, which is equivalent to 0.188 µM of HEVNP ORF2 (refer to step 2.2.4), in 250 µL of 0 - 1% FBS/DMEM.\n\t\nPrepare the negative control sample at 0.01 mg/mL HEVNP-Cy5.5 by following step 4.3 but conjugated with NHS-Cy5.5 dye only, (HEV-Cy5.5). Dilute the HEVNP-Cy5.5 to 0.01 mg/mL, which is equivalent to 0.188 µM of HEVNP ORF2 (refer to step 2.2.4), in 250 µL of 10% FBS supplemented with DMEM.\nWash the cells once by applying 250 µL of 1 M PBS buffer, pH 7.4. Remove the PBS buffer after the wash, while keeping some buffer in the cell culture dish.\nApply 250 µL of LXY30-HEVNP-Cy5.5 in 10% FBS supplemented with DMEM or HEVNP-Cy5.5 in 10% FBS supplemented with DMEM to the cultured MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Shield the cell cultured dishes from light with aluminum foil.\nKeep the cell cultured dishes in a 37 °C cell culture cabinet for 1 h for internalization.",
    "Wash the cultured cells on ice 3 times, 5 min per wash, with 250 µL of 1 M PBS, pH 7.4.\nFix the cells in 4% PFA in 1 M PBS, pH 7.4 for 20 min and then wash once with 250 µL of 1 M PBS, pH 7.4.\n\tNOTE: The cells are now ready to be imaged by confocal microscope. Representative data are shown in Figure 5.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
