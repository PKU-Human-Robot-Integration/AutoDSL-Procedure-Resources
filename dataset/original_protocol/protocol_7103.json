    "See Figure 2 for an overview of the various procedures.Preparation before the day of the assayAdjust the Seahorse XF base medium to pH 7.4.Prepare stock solutions of all drugs and reagents listed in the recipes section.Note: Even though the stock solutions can be prepared in advance, it is important to check the pH of all reagents is 7.4 again before use in the assay. Culture T. gondii parasites so that they egress from the host cells (or are present in large vacuoles inside the host cell) on the day of the assay. Some points to consider:Parasites should not be extracellular for too long before the assay. This is to ensure parasites are assayed when they are at their most healthy/viable.Note: Though we have not done this routinely in our experiments, the infected host-cell flask could be gently washed the evening before the assay to remove any extracellular parasites that have egressed prematurely. We frequently use conditional knockdown parasite lines [e.g., where the gene encoding the protein of interest is under the control of an anhydrotetracycline (ATc) regulatable promoter]; in such instances, pre-culture parasites for the required amount of time in ATc (e.g., 0-3 days) before the assay.We inoculate wells of the Seahorse XFe96 culture plate with 1.5 × 106 parasites/well, and test each condition in triplicate (so 4.5 × 106 parasite cells are required per condition). One 25 cm2 tissue culture flask containing a monolayer of human foreskin fibroblasts yields ~2.5-10 × 107 parasites, and so is usually sufficient for an experiment. If more parasites are required, inoculate multiple 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks, or inoculate larger (e.g., 175 cm2) tissue culture flasks.Note: The number of parasites inoculated per well may need to be optimized depending on the metabolism of the T. gondii strain being tested.",
    "To do this, we recommend titrating different number of parasites in a preliminary experiment. All the parasite strains you would like to compare should be included on the same plate. This is because we apply a linear mixed effects model in our data analysis pipeline (discussed in the Data analysis section), which compares conditions within a plate to recognize the variation between replicates on different days, and thereby measures the treatment effect as precisely as possible.Coat a 96 well Seahorse XFe96 culture plate with Cell-Tak. Perform this procedure in a Biological Safety Cabinet to keep the plate sterile.Combine 750 μL of sterile sodium bicarbonate (0.1 M) with 15 μL of Cell-Tak in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and mix thoroughly. This activates the Cell-Tak and allows it to polymerize and adhere to plastic.Aliquot 15 μL of this mixture into half the wells of the 96 well plate (48 wells).Make a second batch of Cell-Tak solution, as in step a, and aliquot into the second half of the plate, as in b. Two batches are recommended to ensure the solution does not polymerize too quickly.Gently tap the plate to remove any air bubbles from the bottom of the wells, then incubate for 20-30 min at room temperature (RT) to allow the Cell-Tak to adhere to the bottom of each well.Remove the Cell-Tak solution and wash each well 3 times with 100 μL of sterile MilliQ water to remove residual sodium bicarbonate from the wells.Remove the final wash and allow the plate to dry.In our experience, Cell-Tak-coated 96 well Seahorse XFe96 culture plates can be stored in the fridge in a zip-lock bag for up to a week before the assay.The evening before the assay, hydrate the Seahorse XFe96 sensor cartridge according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "The current manufacturer’s instructions are to add 200 μL of sterile water per well into the calibrant plate and lower the sensor cartridge into this (Figure 3).To properly hydrate each of the 96 sensor probes, you must ensure that no air bubbles are trapped beneath the sensor probes.To dislodge air bubbles, gently raise and lower the sensor cartridge into the water in the calibrant plate several times.Inspect for remaining trapped bubbles and, if necessary, repeat Step 5c.The plate and cartridge should then be incubated overnight in a humidified incubator set at 37°C and at atmospheric CO2. A 50 mL aliquot of XF calibrant solution should also be kept in the 37°C incubator overnight to degas.Pre-calculate appropriate concentrations of drugs.The Seahorse XFe96 system is set up so that 25 μL volumes are injected into each of the 96 wells in the Seahorse XFe96 culture plate from ports A-D of the sensor cartridge during the assay (Figure 3).The volume in each of the 96 wells in the Seahorse XFe96 culture plate at the start of the assay is 175 μL. Therefore, solutions injected from port A must be prepared at 8 times the desired final concentration in the well, to account for volume change (25 μL in 175 μL = 1:8 dilution). Similarly, solutions injected from port B must be 9 ×, port C 10 ×, and port D 11 × the desired final concentration to account for the sequential volume change.The drugs should be prepared in the medium being used in the assay [i.e., either Seahorse XF base medium or mitochondrial assay solution (MAS) buffer]. A volume of 25 μL is loaded into each injection port, so calculate the amount of drug needed for the number of wells required (e.g., 48 wells × 25 μL = 1.2 mL).",
    "Make excess if economical to allow loading the ports with a multichannel pipette.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4288/bioprotoc-12-01-4288-g003.jpgFigure 3. Parts of the Seahorse XFe96 sensor cartridge. (Top) In side view, the sensor probes attached to the green sensor cartridge can be seen. The probes contain solid state optical sensors that must be hydrated overnight before use in the assay. (Bottom) In top view, the four injection ports above each of the 96 wells can be seen. The inset depicts the positions of ports A-D and the central sensor probe. Compounds are injected via ports A-D into the well below at user-defined times during the assay.Measurement of OCR and ECAR of intact parasitesThis method describes the measurement of OCR and ECAR of intact extracellular T. gondii parasites that are supplied glucose and glutamine as substrates (Figure 4A). This is based on the typical mitochondrial stress test (MitoStress) assay used to assess mitochondrial function in mammalian cells (Divakaruni et al., 2014). Basal OCR and ECAR are initially measured to determine baseline ETC activity and general metabolic activity of the parasite, respectively (Figure 4B and 4C). The protonophore FCCP is then injected (via port A) to uncouple electron transport from ATP synthesis, allowing the maximal OCR and spare capacity to be calculated (Figure 4A and 4B). Finally, the ETC Complex III inhibitor atovaquone is injected (via port B) to assess non-mitochondrial OCR (Figure 4A and 4B).Our assay differs from a typical MitoStress assay in two main ways. Firstly, oligomycin is typically injected before FCCP to inhibit ATP synthase (Complex V) by blocking the proton channel formed by the F0 domain (Symersky et al., 2012). The addition of oligomycin therefore assesses proton leak and ATP-linked respiration (Divakaruni et al., 2014). However, as oligomycin has limited effect on T.",
    "gondii parasite OCR in our hands, we do not include it in our assay. Why oligomycin has limited effect in our assays is unclear. The ATP synthase complex of T. gondii differs considerably in protein composition (Huet et al., 2018; Salunke et al., 2018) and structure (Mühleip et al., 2021) from that of many other eukaryotes, and it is conceivable that oligomycin does not bind effectively to the protein complex. Alternatively, it is conceivable that the ETC of extracellular T. gondii tachyzoites is largely uncoupled from ATP synthase activity, in which case inhibiting ATP synthase would have minimal effect on OCR [although, we note that the addition of FCCP causes an increase in parasite OCR (Figure 4D), implying that there is some coupling between ATP synthesis and electron transport in T. gondii]. Secondly, the ETC Complex I inhibitor rotenone is commonly combined with the ETC Complex III inhibitor antimycin A to assess non-mitochondrial OCR (Divakaruni et al., 2014). As Complex I is absent from T. gondii parasites (Hayward and van Dooren, 2019), rotenone is also not included in our assay.We frequently use this method when characterizing the function of novel T. gondii proteins, to determine whether mutant parasites that lack the protein-of-interest have a defect in ETC function (Seidi et al., 2018; Hayward et al., 2021). For instance, we generated a parasite strain in which we could knockdown expression of the ETC Complex III protein TgQCR11 through the addition of ATc (Hayward et al., 2021). We observed that TgQCR11 knockdown led to a decrease in basal OCR (Figure 4D). We have also observed that knocking down proteins that function selectively in the ETC [e.g., TgQCR11 (Hayward et al., 2021), or the ETC Complex IV subunit TgApiCox25 (Seidi et al.",
    ", 2018)] does not result in a concomitant impairment of ECAR, and in some cases results in a slight but significant increase in ECAR (Figure 4E). We interpret the observed decrease in OCR but not ECAR as a signature for a selective ETC defect. By contrast, knocking down proteins that are important for general parasite survival leads to a decrease in both OCR and ECAR, and we interpret this as a signature of defects beyond the ETC. For example, knockdown of the heme biosynthesis enzyme TgUroD, or treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, led to a simultaneous decrease in OCR and ECAR (Seidi et al., 2018; Tjhin et al., 2020). The assay therefore differentiates defects in ETC function from defects in broader parasite metabolism, or effects on parasite survival. We note that by substituting atovaquone in Port 2 for a test compound, this assay can also determine whether a compound of interest inhibits the ETC.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4288/bioprotoc-12-01-4288-g004.jpgFigure 4. Measurement of OCR and ECAR of intact T. gondii parasites in a MitoStress assay. A. Schematic of the assay. Intact T. gondii parasites are supplied glucose (Glc) and glutamine (Gln) as energy/electron sources in the Seahorse XF base medium. FCCP is injected via port A to dissipate the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and thereby uncouple electron transport from ATP synthesis. Atovaquone (ATV) is injected via port B to inhibit ETC Complex III. B. Mock traces highlighting the typical OCR response to FCCP and ATV injection, and the calculations that can be performed on the resulting data: namely, the non-mitochondrial OCR (pink) is obtained by averaging the OCR measurements after injection of atovaquone (ATV). The non-mitochondrial OCR can then be subtracted from the measurements before injection of FCCP to calculate the basal mitochondrial OCR (basal mOCR, green).",
    "The non-mitochondrial OCR can also be subtracted from the measurements after injection of FCCP to calculate the maximal mOCR (orange). Finally, the spare capacity is the difference between the maximal and basal mOCR (purple). C. ECAR measurements before injection of FCCP represent the basal ECAR. D.

    "Save the template. When opened at the Seahorse XFe96 machine, open the ‘Run Assay’ tab at the top to start the assay.Experimental procedure for intact MitoStress assay:  Prepare Seahorse XF base medium supplemented with glucose (5 mM) and glutamine (1 mM) (BM+Glc+Gln – see Recipes section). Check the pH and, if necessary, adjust to 7.4. Warm to 37°C in a water bath.Prepare the following in BM+Glc+Gln (5 mL of each is enough for an entire 96 well plate with excess):FCCP (prepare 8 μM for 1 μM final concentration). Add 0.8 μL of FCCP stock (50 mM) to 5 mL of BM+Glc+Gln.Atovaquone (prepare 9 μM for 1 μM final concentration). Add 4.5 μL of atovaquone stock (10 mM) to 5 mL of BM+Glc+Gln.Note: In previous studies, we also included a second Complex III inhibitor, Antimycin A (prepared 90 μM for 10 μM final), in combination with atovaquone (Hayward et al., 2021); however, this is unnecessary as atovaquone yields sufficient inhibition of OCR to allow calculation of non-mitochondrial OCR. While we suspect that antimycin A would also yield sufficient inhibition of OCR when used alone, we would recommend testing this in a pilot experiment. Note: The above concentrations were determined by titrating each compound and selecting the lowest concentration that gave an optimal response. Additional optimization may be required depending on the strain of T. gondii parasites used in the experiments. Inspect parasite-infected host cell flasks. Ideally, parasites should be recently egressed from host cells or still intracellular on the day of the assay, to ensure optimal parasite viability. For safety and sterility, conduct steps involving parasites in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet.",
    "If parasites are mostly still intracellular, release parasites from host cells by first removing host cells from the bottom of the flask using a cell scraper, then passaging infected host cells through a 26 gauge needle to mechanically egress parasites.If extracellular, skip the scraping and needle-passing step.Pass parasite-containing culture medium through a 5 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filter into a 15 mL tube to remove host cell debris (note that a 3 μm polycarbonate filter can also be used).Note: This is step is important to ensure that intact host cells (which contain active mitochondria) do not contribute to OCR measurements. Count parasites using a hemocytometer. Calculate total number of parasites and the volume of base medium required to give 1.5 × 107 parasites/mL.Note: It is critical to have accurate parasite counts to ensure similar number of parasites are used for each condition and between replicates, so we recommend a single person counts all samples for a particular assay to ensure internal consistency. Pellet the parasites by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at RT.Aspirate media.Wash parasite pellet in ~1-2 mL of BM+Glc+Gln. This wash step is important to ensure that NaHCO3-buffered culture medium, which will interfere with ECAR measurements, is sufficiently removed from the samples.Either keep the parasite solution in the 15 mL tube and centrifuge as above, or transfer to a sterile 1.5/2 mL tube and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 1 min at RT. Whether you use the 15 mL or the 1.5/2 mL tube will depend on the volume of base medium the pellet needs to be resuspended in to be at a concentration of 1.5 × 107 parasites/ mL.Aspirate the media from the tubes.Resuspend the parasite pellet to 1.5 × 107 parasites/mL in BM+Glc+Gln.Add 100 μL of the parasite suspension (containing 1.",
    "5 × 106 parasites) to designated wells of a Cell-Tak-coated Seahorse XFe96 culture plate.Fill the blank wells (containing no parasites) with 100 μL of BM+Glc+Gln.Centrifuge the plate at 800 × g for 3 min at RT on a low brake centrifuge setting.Note: We recommend using a low brake setting to enable an even monolayer of parasites to form on the bottom of each well. Inspect the wells using a standard inverted light microscope under the lowest magnification setting, to ensure that an even monolayer of parasites has formed on the bottom of the wells.Note: This is also a good opportunity to visually check whether there are a similar number of parasites in each condition. Top up each well with 75 μL of BM+Glc+Gln for a total volume of 175 μL.Remove the green sensor cartridge from the calibrant plate and, in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet, place it to the side so that the sensor probes are facing up. Replace the water in the wells of the calibrant plate with 200 μL of XF calibrant solution. Place the sensor cartridge back into the calibrant plate and ensure no air bubbles are trapped beneath the sensor probes.Take the Seahorse XFe96 culture plate containing the parasites, the sensor cartridge in the calibrant plate, and the reagents prepared in step 2 to the Seahorse XFe96 machine. Also bring a multichannel pipette that can dispense 25 μL solutions, tips, and reagent reservoirs.Incubate the Seahorse XFe96 culture plate containing the parasites at 37°C in a humidified CO2 free incubator while setting up the Seahorse XFe96 software and loading the cartridge ports.Open the assay template prepared earlier using the Wave software.Using a multichannel pipette, load 25 μL of solutions into appropriate ports of the sensor cartridge following the injection strategy outlined below.Port A: FCCP.",
    "Port B: Atovaquone.Port C: BM+Glc+Gln.Port D: BM+Glc+Gln.Notes:  Care is needed to ensure proper loading of solutions into the port and the cartridge must not be roughly bumped or tapped once the ports are loaded. In our experience, the best practice is to:  Use reverse pipetting to prevent air bubbles. Insert the pipette tip right to the bottom of the port, raise the tip slightly so it is no longer touching the bottom, angle the tip so that it is touching the side of the port, and then gently release the solution into the port. Solution should be visible in each port after correct loading. Common loading mistakes include:  Positioning the pipette tip right at the bottom of the port and releasing the solution too forcefully, resulting in injection through the port into the bottom plate. The port will look empty if this mistake is made. Positioning the tip too close to the top of the port, such that an air bubble forms between the bottom of the port and the solution. The port will appear overly full if this mistake is made. This can cause injection failure during the assay. Once ports of the sensor cartridge are loaded, click “Run Assay” in the Wave software. This will open the tray in the side of the Seahorse XFe96 machine.Ensuring that the lid has been removed, gently place the loaded sensor cartridge sitting in the calibrant plate onto the tray of the Seahorse XFe96 machine and click the prompt to close the tray.Note: The lid must be removed to prevent damage to the machine. The Seahorse XFe96 machine then undergoes a calibration/verification process for approximately 30 min to ensure that the sensor probes are functioning correctly.",
    "Note: If a sensor cartridge fails these calibration/verification steps, we recommend re-starting the Seahorse XFe96 machine and trying a second time. If it fails a second time, the sensor cartridge may be faulty and we would not recommend including the data obtained in the subsequent assay in publications. When prompted, remove the calibrant plate from the tray (the sensor cartridge is retained inside the Seahorse XFe96 machine).Carefully remove the Seahorse XFe96 culture plate (containing parasites) from the 37°C incubator, remove the lid, place it on the tray, and click the prompt to close the tray.The assay starts at this point and, depending on how many cycles of mixing and measuring were selected, takes between 1-2 h to run.Analyses of the resulting data are described in Data analysis Section A.Measurement of substrate-elicited OCR in permeabilized parasitesThe Seahorse XFe96 measurements described in the previous section measure OCR and ECAR in intact extracellular parasite fed glucose and/or glutamine as carbon sources. These experiments rely on the uptake and active metabolism of these substrate in parasites. Seahorse XFe96 assays can also be adapted for measuring OCR that is elicited by direct substrates of the ETC. This involves permeabilizing the parasite plasma membrane with a low concentration of digitonin to allow substrates that would otherwise not enter intact parasites to reach the mitochondrion. Parasites are then incubated with selected substrates that can be directly oxidized by the various dehydrogenases that feed electrons into the ETC (Figure 1). This approach offers information that can be difficult to obtain with intact cells, and has the added benefit of not needing to purify mitochondrial organelles from the parasite to directly assay mitochondrial activities. Utilizing these approaches, we are able to more deeply investigate ETC function in T. gondii.",
    "For example, these approaches allow us to determine the specific step of the ETC that is impaired upon the knockdown of genes encoding proteins that function in the ETC (Hayward et al., 2021), or to elucidate the molecular target of ETC inhibitors. This section describes a method to assess the functionality of different ETC complexes by measuring the OCR of permeabilized T. gondii parasites that have been supplied specific substrates of the ETC (Figure 6A and 6B).In this assay, T. gondii parasites are starved to deplete endogenous energy sources, then the plasma membrane of the parasite is permeabilized with digitonin. Next, a substrate is injected via injection port A to stimulate O2 consumption, together with FCCP to ensure that OCR is occurring at maximum capacity. We have utilized two different substrates for these experiments, both of which independently feed electrons to CoQ: i) malate, which feeds electrons into the ETC via the TCA cycle enzyme malate:quinone oxidoreductase; and ii) glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P), which feeds electrons into the ETC via the mitochondrial G3P dehydrogenase independently of the TCA cycle (Figure 6A; Hayward et al., 2021). If OCR elicited by both substrates is compromised in a parasite mutant, this provides evidence that the defect is occurring downstream of coenzyme Q (i.e., on ETC Complex III or IV). For instance, knockdown of the ETC Complex III subunit TgQCR11 led to a decrease in both malate-dependent (Figure 6C) and G3P-dependent (Figure 6D) OCR (Hayward et al., 2021). If OCR elicited by only one of the substrates is compromised in a parasite mutant, then likely the effect on the ETC is specific to that dehydrogenase.The next step of the assay involves injecting the Complex III inhibitor atovaquone (ATV) via port B.",
    "This will inhibit the ETC at Complex III and enable determination of the non-mitochondrial OCR. Next, to differentiate between a defect in Complex III and Complex IV, reduced N,N,N,N’-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), a substrate that donates electrons directly to CytC (and thereby bypasses Complex III; Figure 6A), is injected via port C. If OCR can be rescued by addition of TMPD, this provides evidence that the defect is occurring upstream of CytC (e.g., at ETC Complex III), whereas if OCR cannot be rescued, this points to a defect downstream of CytC (i.e., in Complex IV). As validation of this approach, we demonstrated that OCR can be rescued by the addition of reduced TMPD in mutant parasites lacking the ETC Complex III subunit TgQCR11 but not the Complex IV subunit TgApiCox25 (Figure 6C; Hayward et al., 2021). Finally, the Complex IV inhibitor sodium azide (NaN3) is injected via port D as validation that the TMPD-dependent OCR is mediated by the ETC upstream of Complex IV (Figure 6B-D).We note that this assay can be easily modified to supply different substrates via port A. A titration of the new substrate should be performed to determine the lowest concentration that gives the maximal OCR response. This assay can also be used to pinpoint the target of ETC inhibitory compounds by substituting atovaquone with the compound of interest in port B. In this case, we would recommend starting with a high concentration of the test compound to yield maximal inhibition, then titrating the concentration of the candidate inhibitor to determine its potency in targeting the ETC.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4288/bioprotoc-12-01-4288-g006.jpgFigure 6.

This is sufficient for an entire plate with excess.Note: The 5% w/v digitonin stock may need to be heated to ~90°C for ~5 min to fully dissolve the digitonin prior to use. Notes:  The 0.",
    "002% (w/v) digitonin concentration was optimized by titrating the digitonin and identifying the lowest concentration that dissipated ECAR (indicating the plasma membrane had been permeabilized) but retained OCR response to substrates such as malate and TMPD. Optimizing the concentration of digitonin is critical, as too low concentrations may not permeabilize the plasma membrane and limit compound entry, while too high concentrations can disrupt the mitochondrial membranes. MAS buffer is a high [K+], low [Na+] buffer designed to mimic intracellular ion concentrations. It is critical that MAS buffer, and not BM, is used in these assays on permeabilized parasites. Prepare substrates/drugs in MAS buffer; 5 ml is enough to cover a plate with excess:8× FCCP (8 μM for 1 μM final), together with 8× of the substrates malate (prepare 80 mM for 10 mM final) or glycerol 3-phosphate (prepare 200 mM for 25 mM final).Note: In previous studies, we used a combination of malate and glutamate (Hayward et al., 2021); however, subsequent testing showed that it is the malate that contributes to OCR as glutamate alone yields no OCR response in these assays. Malate (5 mL): Add 1.25 mL of malate stock (320 mM) and 0.8 μL of FCCP stock (50 mM) to 3.75 mL of MAS buffer.Glycerol 3-phosphate (5 mL): Add 0.8 μL of FCCP stock (50 mM) to 5 mL of glycerol 3-phosphate stock (200 mM).Note: As G3P is a more expensive substrate, this can be prepared on a per-well basis (make 25 μL per well) rather than making 5 mL. 9× Atovaquone (prepare 9 μM for 1 μM final). Add 4.5 μL of atovaquone stock (10 mM) to 5 mL of MAS buffer.",
    "Note: In previous studies, we also included a second Complex III inhibitor, Antimycin A (prepared 90 μM for 10 μM final), in combination with atovaquone (Hayward et al., 2021); however, this is unnecessary as atovaquone yields sufficient inhibition of OCR. 10× TMPD (prepare 2 mM for 0.2 mM final) and ascorbate (prepare 33 mM for 3.3 mM final). Add 835 μL of ascorbate stock (200 mM) to 4.155 mL MAS buffer and mix. Then, add 20 μL of TMPD stock (500 mM) and mix again. The solution should be light brown in color.Note: It is important to add the ascorbate to the MAS buffer first and then add the TMPD. The purpose of the ascorbate is that it keeps the TMPD in a reduced state. If the solution appears green/blue in color rather than light brown, the TMPD is in an oxidized state. In this instance, we recommend re-making the ascorbate solution to ensure the TMPD is reduced prior to the assay. Sodium azide (NaN3, prepare 110 mM for 10 mM final). The sodium azide stock (110 mM) can be made in advance and is ready to use as is.Note: The above concentrations of substrates and inhibitors were determined by titrating each compound and selecting the lowest concentration that gave an optimal response. Additional optimization may be required depending on the strain of T. gondii parasites. Inspect parasite-infected host cell flasks. Ideally, parasites should be freshly egressed from host cells or exist in large intracellular vacuoles within host cells on the day of the assay to ensure optimal parasite viability.If the bulk of the parasites are intracellular, mechanically egress parasites from host cells by scraping infected host cells from the flask using a cell scraper and passing infected host cells through a 26 gauge needle.",
    "If parasites are extracellular, skip the scraping and needle-passing step.Remove host cell debris by passing egressed parasite cultures through a 3 µm polycarbonate or a 5 μm PVDF filter into a 15 mL tube. This step is important because contaminating host cells can contribute to OCR.Count parasites using a hemocytometer. Calculate total number of parasites. It is critical to have accurate parasite counts to ensure that a similar number of parasites are used for each condition, so we recommend a single person counts all samples for a particular assay to ensure internal consistency.Centrifuge the 15 mL tubes containing the parasites at 1,500 × g for 10 min at RT to pellet parasites.Aspirate media from the tubes.Wash parasite pellet in ~1-2 mL of non-supplemented BM.Either keep the parasite solution in the 15 mL tube and centrifuge as above, or transfer to a sterile 1.5/2 mL tube and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 1 min at RT.Aspirate the media from the tubes.Gently resuspend the pellet to 1.5 × 107 parasites per mL in non-supplemented BM.Incubate the parasites for 1 h in a 37°C incubator to starve them of endogenous substrates. Note: It is important to optimize the length of starvation for each parasite strain. In our hands, over-starving the parasite can lead to an apparent loss of viability, culminating in lower-than-expected OCR readings. Under-starving parasites can result in higher than expected preliminary OCR readings, which can complicate subsequent data analysis. Our preliminary experiments suggest that different lengths of time may be required to optimally starve different parasite strains. Add 100 μL of the parasite suspension (containing 1.5 × 106 parasites) to designated wells of a Cell-Tak-coated Seahorse XFe96 culture plate.Fill the blank wells (containing no parasites) with 100 μL of BM.",
    "Centrifuge the plate on low brake at 800 × g for 3 min at RT.Using a microscope, check that a parasite monolayer has formed at the bottom of the well. This is also a good opportunity to visually check whether there are a similar number of parasites in each condition.Remove the sensor cartridge from the calibrant plate and place it to the side so that the sensor probes are facing up. Replace the water in the wells of the calibrant plate with 200 μL of XF calibrant solution. Place the sensor cartridge back into the calibrant plate and ensure no air bubbles are trapped beneath the sensor probes.Take the Seahorse XFe96 culture plate containing the parasites, the sensor cartridge in the calibrant plate, the digitonin in MAS buffer prepared in step 2, and the reagents prepared in step 3 to the Seahorse Xfe96 machine. Also bring multichannel pipettes that can dispense 25 μL and 200 μL volumes, tips, and reagent reservoirs.Incubate the Seahorse XFe96 culture plate containing the parasites at 37°C in a humidified incubator at atmospheric CO2.Open the assay template prepared earlier using the Wave software.Load 25 μL of drug solutions into appropriate ports of the sensor cartridge following the injection strategy outlined below.Port A: FCCP + Malate OR FCCP + Glycerol 3-phosphate.Port B: Atovaquone.Port C: TMPD + Ascorbate.Port D: Sodium azide.Note: Care is needed to ensure proper loading of solutions into the port. See the tips provided in the Procedure Section B notes. Once loaded, click “Run Assay” in the Wave software.When prompted, and ensuring that the lid has been removed, place the loaded sensor cartridge sitting in the calibrant plate into the Seahorse XFe96 machine.The Seahorse XFe96 machine then undertakes a calibration/verification process for approximately 30 min to ensure the sensor probes are functioning correctly.",
    "Toward the end of the calibration/verification process, remove the Seahorse XFe96 culture plate containing the parasites from the 37°C incubator.Using the P200 multichannel pipette, gently remove the BM from the well. Note: care needs to be taken not to disturb the parasite monolayer during this step.Carefully add 175 μL of 0.002% (w/v) digitonin in MAS buffer to each well using the P200 multichannel pipette. This solution permeabilizes the plasma membrane of the parasites.Notes:  We recommend angling the pipette tips against the wall of the wells and slowly releasing the solution so that the parasite monolayer is not disturbed during this step. For best results, we recommend limiting the amount of time the parasites are permeabilized for prior to the start of the assay, and keeping this time consistent between independent replicates of an assay. We find that response to substrates decreases with increasing time since permeabilization. When prompted, remove the calibrant plate from the machine and replace with the culture plate containing permeabilized parasites, ensuring the lid has been removed.The assay starts at this point and, depending on how many cycles of mixing and measuring were selected, takes between 1-2 h to run.Analyses of the resulting data are described in Data analysis Section B."
