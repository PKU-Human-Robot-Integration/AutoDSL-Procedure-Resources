    "Preparation of the phase separation experiment (15–20 min) Thaw all the proteins and reagents on ice before proceeding with the experiment.Keep the incubator/dry bath at 30 °C.Pre-cool the microcentrifuge tubes by embedding them into ice before proceeding with the experiment.Clean the workbench with 70% ethanol (alternative: use decontaminating agents like RNaseZap) before proceeding, as phase separation requires RNA, which might degrade because of RNase contamination or impurities.Prepare LLPS buffer for a reaction mixture of 120 µL total volume, as shown in Table 1 (10 min):Reaction I:  Edc3-mCherry + PSBReaction II:  Edc3-mCherry + 1 µg RNA + PSBReaction III:  Edc3-mCherry + 0.2 mM NADH + PSBTable 1.

    "Phase separation reaction (Figure 3) (1 h 20 min) Prepare the reaction mixtures as indicated in step A5, and keep them ready on ice.Incubate the reaction mixtures at 30 °C for 1 h without disturbing the reaction tubes.Take out the reaction mixtures, and gently vortex (or tap) the microcentrifuge tube to mix the phase-separated proteins.Aliquot 30 µL ×3 reactions to 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes using a 200-µL tip with a cut (at 3–5 mm at the nozzle), and place the reactions on ice. Cutting the tip at the nozzle is critical, as it might affect the size of the phase-separated protein due to suction pressure or size restriction at its nozzle.Prepare and execute the reactions from step B4 for the disassembly experiment (steps C1–C3).Immediately carry forward the remaining reaction from step B3 for processing and visualization (steps D1–E6) to confirm the assembly. The processing and visualization of the phase separation reactions are discussed in steps D1–E6.Reaction for disassembly experiment (Figure 4) (1 h 20 min) Add 10 µM of purified Sbp1 or Sbp1ΔRGG or Bovine Serum Albumin (Figure 3) to the respective reactions from step B4. Mix the reaction by tapping or gentle vortexing.Incubate the reaction mixtures at 30 °C for 1 h without perturbing the microcentrifuge stand or the reaction tubes.Keep the reaction on ice after incubation for post-incubation processing (steps D1–D3). Post incubation processing of the reactions (5 min) Spin the reactions at 200 × g for 2 min.Gently take out 20 µL of the reaction using a 200 µL tip cut at its nozzle to discard as we will not be working with the supernatant.Keep the remaining reaction from step D2 on ice for visualization under the microscope (steps E1–E6).",
    "Visualizing the phase-separated protein under the microscope (7 min–15 min) Remove 5 µL of the reaction from the reaction leftover, and place it on a coverslip forming a dropletNote: Place the coverslip on a lint-free tissue paper to avoid capturing unwanted particles from the bench. Place the glass slide on the coverslip. Fix the glass slide to the coverslip by gently putting pressure on the glass slide from the top using your thumb. Make sure the reaction gets evenly diffused between the slide and coverslip.Pipette 2 µL of 1.516 NA immersion oil onto the coverslip.Mount the slide on the microscope.Turn the mCherry filter on (excitation: 587 λ; emission: 610 λ) and gently use the fine focusing of the microscope to focus on the assemblies. This step is time-sensitive, as the assemblies from step B6 might grow larger in size when kept at RT for a prolonged period. The imaging time should not exceed more than 7 min. It would take some time to practice focusing on the assemblies, as they are not very clearly visible in white light. We suggest performing a few mock experiments before proceeding with the main experiment. We also recommend setting up initial reactions in a staggered manner, to get enough time for visualizing each reaction.The assemblies appear as depicted in Figure 3."
