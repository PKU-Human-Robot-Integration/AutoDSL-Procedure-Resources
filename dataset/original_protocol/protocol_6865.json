    "Rice Root Hair GrowthSterilize the glume removed-rice seeds with 70% EtOH for 2 min, and remove the disinfectant alcohol. Then, sterilize the seeds with 10% sodium hypochlorite for 30 min on a horizontal shaker. Rinse the seeds thoroughly 5 times with sterile distilled water.Place the seeds on sterile absorbent paper for drying.Sow the seeds onto 0.8% phytagel half-strength MS medium (pH = 5.8).Note: To avoid too much moisture attached to the root hairs, it is highly recommended to seal the medium plates with 3M Micropore surgical tape. Place the medium plate vertically in the growth chamber under a temperature regime of 30°C/22°C (day/night) with 50% or lower humidity and a 12 h photoperiod (15,000 lux).Note: Lowering the humidity is an effective way to reduce the moisture in the plate. Use three-day-old rice roots after germination for subsequent sample treatment.Preparation for Cryo-SEMInstall the SEM stage cold module (Figures 1; see Video 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g001.jpgFigure 1. SEM stage cold module installation. Dovetail and fit the module with a thermometer. Push the copper shaft and copper shaft sleeve together to make an interference fit connection. Ensure that the real-time module temperatures are displayed on the keypad.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. SEM stage cold module installation Check the Alto 2100 keypad (or control panel) (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g002.jpgFigure 2. The keypad at the very beginning of the start-up. The keypad allows control of the pump and the system’s valves, sputter coater, lighting, and heater. All temperature and pressure readings are instantly available and easy to observe on the keypad.Prep chamber precooling (Figure 3, see Video 2)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g004.jpgFigure 3. The prep-chamber before adding liquid nitrogen. The red circles indicate the inlet and outlet for liquid nitrogen. The red ellipse indicates the pressure indicator LED display.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2.",
    "Pour the liquid nitrogen into the prep chamber inlet Precool the SEM cold stage modulePour liquid nitrogen into the open topped dewar where the pipeline is immersed (see Video 3). The pipeline is filled with high-purity nitrogen gas. The cooled gas in the pipeline cools down the SEM stage cold module below -180°C.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Pour liquid nitrogen into the open topped dewar Note: Ventilate the cryo-pipeline for at least 5 min before running the cryo-SEM system. A uniform flow rate of nitrogen in the pipeline is necessary for image quality. Produce slush nitrogenPour the liquid nitrogen into the slush chamber and close the lid (see Video 4).Note: Wear waterproof cryogloves! <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Preparation of slush nitrogen Press the SLUSH/VENT button on the Alto control panel to activate slush chamber pumping (see Video 4).Allow the liquid nitrogen to boil until it solidifies. This step takes approximately two minutes.Press the SLUSH/VENT button again to stop pumping and vent the air into the chamber.Remove the lid before use.Root Sample AcquisitionCut a 1-2 cm length of wild type or mutant straight growing seminal roots for use.Add a drop of carbon-rich conductive glue to the aluminum stub of the specimen holder (see Video 5).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 5. The conductive glue was applied to the aluminum stub Place a piece of moist nitrocellulose paper, immersed in distilled water in advance, on the glue (see Video 6).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 6. Putting the nitrocellulose paper onto the sample stage and applying gel Gently clamp the cut-off root end with tweezers and transfer the root onto nitrocellulose paper. Place the root as horizontally as possible (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g003.jpgFigure 4. Clamping the rice root onto the nitrocellulose paper. First, apply conductive glue to the aluminum stub. Then, place the nitrocellulose paper on the gel.",
    "After that, spread the conductive glue to the near end of the rod. Last, stick the root cut end on the glue and lay the root flat on the nitrocellulose paper.Immerse the trimmed root end in the glue (Figure 4).Root Sample RepreparationStick together the specimen holder with a root sample on its stub and the sample holder integrated with the vacuum transfer device (VTD) (see Video 7).Buckle the sample holder (with the VTD) to the slush chamber until the VTD sits on the O-ring in the recess located on the top of the slushing chamber (see Video 7).Slide the rod in the VTD down (see Video 7).Grip the sample holder in the air above the nitrogen pool for 10 s to quickly freeze the root hair (see Video 7).Plunge the sample holder into the slushy nitrogen to rapidly cool the sample (see Video 7).Note: Ensure that only the sample holder is immersed in the nitrogen when slushing, otherwise the cold rod freezes the VTD’s O-ring. This has a negative influence on the subsequent push-pull operation and/or the gas tightness. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 7. The sample immersed into the nitrogen slush Press the SLUSH/VENT button to activate slush chamber pumping.Pull the VTD rod upward and fully retract the sample holder into VTD before the nitrogen slush completely solidifies (see Video 8).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 8. The sample waiting to leave the slushing station Push the trapdoor valve (see Video 9) (The sample is now held in the VTD under a vacuum and ready for transfer into the prep chamber).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 9. The sample leaving the slushing station Press the SLUSH/VENT button once again to vent the slush chamber.Transfer and place the VTD in the GATE VALVE airlock (see Video 10).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 10.",
    "Pump the Gate Value airlock vacuum Press the LOAD PUMP button on the Alto control panel to vacuum the prep chamber (Figure 2).Wait until six bars of indicator light illuminate, which is indicated by the red ellipse in Figure 3.Fully open the valve, push the rod, and insert the specimen holder into the dovetail stage in the prep chamber (Figures 5-6; see Video 11).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g005.jpgFigure 5. The dovetail stage in the prep-chamber. The dovetail stage is convenient for the angled sides of the sample holders and is fitted with a thermometer and a heater. There is a stopper to allow the sample holder to be transferred to exactly the same position. A spring clip secures the holder and prevents vibration.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g006.jpgFigure 6. The rice root sample before sublimating and sputtering. The white circle indicates that the sample is waiting to be sublimated and sputtered on the stage.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 11. Transfer the sample to the prep chamber (The VTD and prep chamber valves are opened simultaneously) Set the sublimation temperature of the prep-chamber stage to -95°C (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g007.jpgFigure 7. The sublimation temperature settings. By pressing the SET TEMPERATURE buttons, set the sublimation temperature to -95°C.Press the HEAT button to start warm-up (see Video 12) (For rice root hairs, maintaining at -95°C for 300 s is optimal. The sublimation time mainly depends on the humidity of the root culture environment).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 12. The sublimation temperature keeps rising Press the HEAT button again to stop heating and recover the temperature to ≤ -140°C.Set the gold sputter time and press the SPUTTER button on the control panel (120 s is sufficient for root hairs) (Figure 8).Note: If the prep chamber is not equipped with a microscope device, samples can be transferred to the SEM chamber for rough viewing before sputtering.",
    "This step is extremely important for obtaining favorable samples and high-quality images. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g008.jpgFigure 8. The sputter parameter display. The default setting of the sputter electric current is 10 mA. Before argon sputtering, the stage temperature should be cooled to ≤-140°C.The argon inlet solenoid closes automatically when the time is up (Figure 9; see Video 13).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g009.jpgFigure 9. The rice root being sputtered. The rice root sample should be placed under the coating head during sputtering.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 13. The sample is being sputtered SEM MicroscopyOpen the ball valve between the preparation chamber and the SEM chamber when the indicator LED light turns green (Figures 10-11).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4037/bioprotoc---4037-g010.jpgFigure 10.
