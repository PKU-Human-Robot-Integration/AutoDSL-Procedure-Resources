Plasmid Constructs\nAmplify the open reading frames of the genes by PCR, and clone the PCR products into PCRII-TOPO vector.\nConfirm the products by sequencing, and clone the cDNA encoding CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet, CyPet-SUMO1, YPet and catalytic domains of SENP1 into the pET28 (b) vector with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag.\n2. Protein Expression and Purification\nTransform Escherichia coli cells of strain BL21 (DE3) with pET28 (b) vectors encoding CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet, CyPet-SUMO1, YPet and the catalytic domains of SENP1.\nGrown the transformed bacteria in 2xYT medium for 3 hr at 37 °C (shaking at 250 rpm) to reach an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm.\nAdd 100 μM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (final concentration) to induce protein expression and shake for 16 hr at 25 °C at 200 rpm.\nHarvest the bacteria by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min and resuspend them in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole.\nSonicate the cells for 10 min in 5-sec intervals at a power setting of 25 W using MiSonics 4,000 sonicator and collect them by centrifugation at 35,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 min.\nSet up the column with 500 ml Ni-NTA beads for 1 L culture and transfer the supernatant into the column.\nWash the resin with buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole twice.\nElute protein with buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole and dialysis into a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 4 °C overnight.",
    "Determine the concentrations of the purified proteins by the Bradford assay. Alternative method for protein concentration measurements will be SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and then stained with Coomassie blue followed with imaging quantitative.\n3. Quantitative FRET Spectrum Analysis\nThe general strategy for the assay was based on FRET signaling (Figure 1). The FRET pair, CyPet and YPet, was tagged to the N- and C-termini, respectively, of pre-SUMO1. SENP1 cleaves the fusion protein CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet at the Gly-Gly site in SUMO1's C-terminus and, thus, releases the SUMO tail with YPet. The FRET signal is disrupted, resulting in an increase of the emission from CyPet and a dramatic decrease of YPet's emission at the CyPet excitation wavelength.\nWhen excited by light of wavelength 414 nm, the total fluorescence emission of CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet at 530 nm can be derived from three sources: the absolute FRET-induced YPet's emission, CyPet direct emission and YPet direct emission (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4430/4430eq1.jpg\nwhere FL530/414 is the total fluorescence emission at 530 nm when excited at 414 nm, FLFRET is the absolute FRET signal, FLCyPet(cont) is the CyPet direct emission when excited at 414 nm, and FLYPet (cont) is the YPet direct emission when excited at 414 nm. The subscript of (cont) stands for contribution.\nThe direct emission of CyPet at 530 nm was proportional to its emission at 475 nm when excited at 414 nm with a constant ratio of α. CyPet-SUMO1 was prepared at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 750 nM and 1 mM, and emissions at 475 and 530 nm were measured after excitation at 414 nm to determine α (Figure 3-1).",
    "The direct emission of YPet at 530 nm under excitation at 414 nm was proportional to its emission at 530 nm when excited at 475 nm with a constant ratio of β. YPet was prepared at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 500, 750 and 1,000 nM, and the emission at 530 nm was measured when the samples were excited by wavelengths of 414 and 475 nm to determine β (Figure 3-2).\nWhen CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet was digested by SENP1, the cleavage released CyPet-SUMO1 and the SUMO1 tail with YPet. When the compound was excited at 414 nm, the fluorescence emission at 530 nm (FL'530/414) was decreased but can still be divided into three parts as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4430/4430eq2.jpg\nwhere FL'530/414 is the total fluorescence emission at 530 nm after digestion when excited at 414 nm, FL'FRET is the remaining absolute FRET signal, FL'CyPet(475/414)is the CyPet emission at 475 nm after digestion when excited at 414 nm (here the CyPet emission is from two parts: undigested CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet and digested CyPet-SUMO1), and FLYPet (530/475) is the YPet emission when excited at 475 nm, which is constant whether CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet is digested or not.\nAfter digestion by SENP1, the remaining FRET emission (FL'FRET) is:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4430/4430eq3.jpg\nwhere C is the total concentration of CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet and x is the concentration of digested CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet.\nBy combining all of the items, the detected fluorescence emission at 530 nm under excitation of 414 nm (FL'530/414) is:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4430/4430eq4.jpg\n4. FRET-based Protease Assay for Enzyme Kinetic Study\nCyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet was incubated with the catalytic domain of SENP1 at 37 °C in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 and 1 mM DTT to a total volume of 80 ml and transferred into 384-well plate.",
    "Runs were conducted by measuring the fluorescence emission at 475 and 530 nm after an excitation at 414 nm in a fluorescence multiwell plate reader for 5 min with 15-sec intervals.\nThe reaction rate (v) was correlated with the change in the amount of substrate (S) as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4430/4430eq5.jpg\nThe concentration of product increased exponentially from 0 as [S]0 (original substrate concentration) when t=0:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4430/4430eq6.jpg\nWhen t=0, the original velocity (V0) is:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4430/4430eq7.jpg\nThe concentration of SENP1 was fixed, and the concentration of CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet was increased from 100 times more than the concentration of enzyme, which is required by Michaelis-Menten equation.\nAll of the fluorescent readings were analyzed by the quantitative FRET analysis method and plotted in GraphPad Prism V Software to fit the Michaelis-Menten equation. The nonlinear regression can also be performed with the aid of more common software packages like spreadsheet programs (such as Microsoft Excel).\n5. Representative Results\nMaturation of pre-SUMO1 by SENP1 can be determined by monitoring the changes in the fluorescence signal at 475 and 530 nm during the process. The result showed that the velocity of pre-SUMO1 digestion by SENP1 in a substrate-dose dependent manner (Figure 4). This suggests that the catalytic domain of SENP1 exhibits excellent activity for pre-SUMO1's maturation. The initial reaction velocities were calculated by the above analysis with different substrate concentrations (Table 1).\nThe kcat/KM ratio is generally used to compare the efficiencies of different enzymes with one substrate or a particular enzyme with different substrates. KM and Vmax can be obtained from the Michaelis-Menten equation by plotting the various initial velocities, corresponding to the different concentrations of CyPet-(pre-SUMO1)-YPet (Figure 5). kcat was obtained as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4430/4430eq8.jpg",
    "According to the above analysis, the calculated KM was 0.21 ± 0.04 μM, the kcat was 6.90 ± 0.28 s-1, and the kcat/KM ratio was (3.2 ± 0.55) x107 M-1s-1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4430/4430fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
