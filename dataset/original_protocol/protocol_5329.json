    "Growing liquid cultures of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and biofilm-forming mutants thereofRound-bottom Pyrex tubes (20 cm in length, 3 cm in diameter) are used as growth vessels. A cotton-plugged Pasteur pipette (23 cm long) is inserted through a sponge-plug such that the tip of the Pasteur pipette is placed 1-2 cm above the bottom of the tube (Figure 2A, ‘growth set’). Growth sets are autoclaved in liquid cycle.Sterile liquid BG11-medium (25-50 ml) (see Recipes) is transferred into the Pyrex tube. The culture volume is adjusted to the biomass required for the designated experiment.Cells are scraped from solid-BG11 medium (see Recipes) with a 1 ml sterile plastic pipette and the biomass is shaken in the liquid medium (see Note 4). Important: To reproducibly observe biofilm formation, it is crucial to add the ferric ammonium citrate and citric acid components from a freshly made stock (see note in Recipe 1f). Autoclaved BG11 should be used within 4 days to inoculate cultures. Connect the growth set to the bubbling system (see description above) via 1 ml pipette tip (Figure 2A).The use of manifolds allows simultaneous bubbling of multiple cultures (Figure 2B, see Note under Equipment).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170717/20170717201922_0413.jpgFigure 2. Growing cyanobacterial cultures. A. Growth set connected to a single manifold channel; B. Cultures in the growth room.Quantification of biofilmCells are cultured under continuous bubbling of 3% CO2 in air at 30 °C under continuous illumination with incandescent light (20-30 μmol photons m-2  sec-1).Starting cultures at the exponential phase are diluted (usually following 3 days of growth) to an optical density at 750 nm of 0.5.Experiments are initiated by an additional dilution of the cultures to an optical density at 750 nm of 0.5 (see Note 5). Biofilm development under this setup typically begins after 2-3 days.",
    "To verify that cultures are axenic ‘spot’ a 20 μl aliquot on solid LB agar. Percentage of chlorophyll in suspended cells serves to quantify biofilm formation as follows (Figure 3):Extraction of chlorophyll in planktonic cells is performed in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Remove an aliquot from the upper part of the suspended culture (see Note 6). In cases where the suspended fraction appears especially dense (planktonic strains or poor biofilm formers), a 0.2 ml sample is used for extraction. When robust biofilms are formed, 15 ml of planktonic cells are removed and concentrated 3 to 6-fold by centrifugation (5,000 x g, 10 min) prior to the chlorophyll extraction in 80% acetone (final concentration). Extraction of chlorophyll in the biofilm is performed in the growth tube. To separate the biofilm fraction, slowly remove the suspended cells. Biofilms tend to collapse during removal of the last few ml of liquid. Therefore, once clumps of biofilm detach and fall into the liquid, stop removing the culture. Measure the volume remaining in the tubes using a pipette (in our hands 2-5 ml are left) as well as the volume removed from the culture. The sum of these volumes (Vtotal) serves for calculation of the amount of chlorophyll in the suspended cells (see Data analysis). Extraction of chlorophyll is performed in 80% acetone at a final volume equal to Vtotal. Extraction of chlorophyll is carried out overnight in the refrigerator and chlorophyll is quantified based on absorbance as previously described (Arnon, 1949; Ritchie, 2006). Chlorophyll may be extracted with methanol instead of acetone. A step-by-step protocol for measurement of chlorophyll a concentration in cyanobacteria is described by Zavřel et al. (2015).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170717/20170717202224_6017.jpgFigure 3. Quantification of biofilm based on chlorophyll measurement"
