    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nDelivery of Nucleases and Template Plasmids for HDR\nTiming: 1 week\nThe purpose of this step is to deliver all the molecular requirements to edit the desired locus with a specific cassette for further MADR applications.\nCoat the plate with Poly-L-lysine.\nAdd enough 0.01% Poly-L-lysine to coat a 6-well plate (0.5 mL per well).\nIncubate the coated plate in an incubator at 37°C for 30 min.\nRemove the Poly-L-lysine and wash the plate once with PBS. Remove all PBS.\nAllow the plate to dry completely either in the hood or in an incubator for faster drying.\nNote: Poly-L-lysine is not necessary, but it is useful to maintain attachment of the cells to the plate after the transfection step. Poly-D-lysine should be used in cell lines that are able to digest Poly-L-lysine.\nNote: All cell culture is performed in a biosafety level II cabinet and a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nPlate the cells.\nPlate the Neuro-2a and HEK293T cells around 30% confluency using high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% HI-FBS, 1% PSA and 1% glutamax.\nChange media every 3 days.\nCells are ready to be transfected when they reach 60%–70% confluency.\nNote: The time needed to reach 60%–70% confluency depends on the type and number of cells plated previously.\nAspirate old media and add 1 mL of fresh media 1 h before transfection.\nNote: For transfection of cells we used Lipofectamine 3000 but any in vitro transfection method can be used.\nTransfection of plasmid donor repair template and nuclease plasmids.\nMix the plasmids in a 1:1 ratio w/w.\nFor the Neuro-2a cells mix 1,250 ng of the sgRosa26-Cas9 plasmid and 1,250 ng of the Rosa26 mT/mG donor template for a total of 2.5 μg DNA in sterile water or TE buffer.",
    "For the HEK293T cells mix 850 ng of each of the AAVS1-TALENs plasmids and 850 ng of the AAVS1 TagBFP2-NLS donor template for a total of 2.55 μg DNA in sterile water or TE buffer.\nIn a 1.5 mL tube, dilute each plasmid suspension mix in 250 μL of Opti-MEM medium and add 5 μL of P3000 reagent.\nIn a separate 1.5 mL tube, dilute 5 μL of Lipofectamine 3000 in 250 μL of Opti-MEM medium.\nAdd diluted DNA to diluted Lipofectamine 3000 and mix well. The final volume should be approximately 500 μL for each plasmid mix. Incubate the reaction at 20°C–25°C for 15 min.\nAdd the final suspension dropwise into to their respective cell culture, directly into the media.\nAdd the mix containing the sgRosa26-Cas9 plasmid and Rosa26 mT/mG donor template to the Neuro-2a cells.\nAdd the mix containing the AAVS1-TALENs plasmids and AAVS1 TagBFP2-NLS donor template to the HEK293T cells.\nIncubate the reaction at 37°C in a sterile incubator for 24 h.\nAdd fresh medium and replace it every three days.\nNote: The quantity of plasmid and media that is described in this step is for cell cultures plated in 1 well of a 6-well plate with a surface area of 9 cm2. For smaller or bigger plates, adapt the final quantity based on the manufacturer’s protocol.\nClone Selection\nTiming: 4 weeks\nThe purpose of this step is to enrich the cell population that successfully integrated the DNA cassette from the donor template into their respective loci.\nIdentify the cells that express the reporter transgenes with a fluorescence microscope.\nFor this protocol identify the tdTomato positive Neuro-2a cells.\nFor this protocol identify the nuclear TagBFP2-NLS positive HEK293T cells.",
    "Critical: Because a transient transfection was performed, not all positive cells expressing the reporter transgenes have inserted the desired cassette into their loci. Actually, a very low number of cells successfully integrate the cassette through the HDR process (Devkota, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Gaj et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Culturing the cells for at least 2 weeks post transfection allows the episomal DNA to be diluted out of the cells (Cooper et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Homann et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nSelect the positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\nMaintain and expand the cells for around 2 weeks.\nNote: Varying intensities of fluorescent signals can be observed due to the episomal copy number expression.\nPerform 2 or 3 rounds of cell purification through FACS until 100% purity is reached.\nThe new Neuro-2a cell line is named Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mT/mG” Proxy-MADR (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nThe new HEK293T cell line is named HEK293T AAVS1 “TagBFP2-NLS” Proxy-MADR (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: We recommend freezing the cells at least 1 month post selection to allow the cells to dilute out the episomal DNA. Allow the cells to be in culture 2–3 days after thawing for further experiments. For improved viability, cells should be split at least once after thawing before use in experiments.\nNote: Loss of fluorescent reporter intensity should not be observed because the cassette has been inserted in a safe harbor under strong promoters.\nCritical: Verify 2 weeks after the last FACS if negative cells are still present in the cell culture and perform another round of FACS if needed.\ndRMCE Validation in Proxy-MADR Cells\nTiming: 1 week",
    "Two requirements are needed to validate dual recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (dRMCE) (Osterwalder et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) in the Proxy-MADR cells. First, a promoter-less donor plasmid which can have any transgene flanked by loxP and FRT sites in the same orientation as the targeted locus. In addition, the open reading frame (ORF) should be preceded by phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and trimerized SV40 polyadenylation signals (i.e., 4× polyA) or equivalent elements to avoid transcription from unintegrated episomes and randomly integrated whole plasmids. The ORF should be followed by poly(A) elements but may be interceded by a WPRE element to promote RNA stability and facilitate transgene expression. Here, this plasmid is referred to as MADR pDonor (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2C). Second, a plasmid that allows for the expression of the two recombinases which recognize the loxP and FRT sites, Cre and Flp, respectively. In this protocol, one plasmid expressing both recombinases is used, called pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2C). See Kim et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] and Rincon Fernandez Pacheco et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] accompanying STAR protocol for a detailed description and construction of these plasmids.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/291-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dual Recombinase-Mediated Cassette Exchange Validation (dRMCE) in Proxy-MADR Cells\n(A) Schematic showing dRMCE or Cre-mediated excision in the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mTmG” locus.\n(B) Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mT/mG” Proxy-MADR cells expressing tdTomato, EGFP, or TagBFP2 after dRMCE or Cre-mediated excision.\n(C) Schematic showing dRMCE in the HEK293T AAVS1 “TagBFP2-NLS” locus.\n(D) HEK293T AAVS1 “TagBFP2-NLS” Proxy-MADR cells expressing mScarlet after dRMCE. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nTransfection of MADR pDonor and pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV.\nNote: Any in vitro transfection methodology can be used. In this protocol, Lipofectamine 3000 is used.\nCoat plates with Poly-L-lysine as described in step 1.\nPlate cells and let them grow until they reach ∼60% confluency. See step 2.",
    "Prepare a mix of plasmids containing the pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and the MADR pDonor. The suggested ratio is 1:2 w/w, pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV: MADR pDonor.\nMix 800 ng of pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and 1,600 ng of MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE for a total of 2.4 μg DNA in sterile water or TE buffer.\nMix 800 ng of pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and 1,600 ng of MADR pDonor-mScarlet-3XSpot WPRE for a total of 2.4 μg DNA in sterile water or TE buffer.\nCritical: It is highly recommended to have Flp and Cre in the same plasmid to enhance the dRMCE (Anderson et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: The MADR pDonor TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE plasmid contains a TagBFP2 transgene with three flag epitope tags flanked upstream by one loxP site and downstream by one FRT site (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The MADR pDonor-mScarlet-3XSpot WPRE contains an mScarlet (Bindels et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) transgene with three spot tags flanked upstream by one loxP site and downstream by one FRT site (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nProceed with the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection as described in steps 3b–3d.\nAdd the final suspension dropwise into to their respective cell culture, directly into the media.\nAdd the mix containing the pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and MADR pDonor-TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE to the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mT/mG” Proxy-MADR cells.\nAdd the mix containing the pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and MADR pDonor-mScarlet-3XSpot WPRE to the HEK293T AAVS1 “TagBFP2-NLS” Proxy-MADR cells.\nIncubate the reaction at 37°C in a sterile incubator for 24 h.\nAdd fresh medium and replace it every three days.\nVisualization of transgene expression.\nNote: If recombination has occurred through dRMCE, cells should express the transgenes present in the promoter-less MADR pDonor.\n) Confirm the expression of the MADR pDonor transgene under a fluorescence microscope.",
    "Note: In our experience, the expression of transgenes can be visualized 48 h post transfection. This is longer than is required for transfection or nucleofection, presumably because the transgene must integrate before expression—which requires FlpO and Cre expression and the subsequent multistep dRMCE reaction.\nFor this protocol, look for a blue fluorescent signal in the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mT/mG” Proxy-MADR cells under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: For the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mT/mG” Proxy-MADR cells it is highly probable to see EGFP-positive cells as the tdTomato transgene got excised due to the CRE-loxP recombination (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). For a more accurate discussion, see Kim et al, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] and Rincon Fernandez Pacheco et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] accompanying STAR protocol.\nFor this protocol, look for a red fluorescent signal in the HEK293T AAVS1 “TagBFP2-NLS” Proxy-MADR cells under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nSwapping of MADR Elements\nTiming: 3 days when a pure cell population is not required\nAfter validating the functionality of the Proxy-MADR cells, it is possible to swap any cassette using MADR and purify the cells based on the newly inserted cassette. Thus, no more locus editing through HDR or similar processes is needed. For this protocol, we performed experiments with the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mT/mG” Proxy-MADR cells, but it can be applied to any cell that has all the requirements to apply MADR.",
    "Note: One of the disadvantages of the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mT/mG” Proxy-MADR cells, in terms of visualization, is that any further cassette integration through MADR should avoid red or green fluorescent reporter transgenes. That is why a blue fluorescent reporter transgene was used in the previous experiment. To have more options available to select desired cells, e.g., to use a MADR pDonor containing a red fluorescent reporter, it is suggested to work with the EGFP-positive cells that went through Cre and Flp-mediated excision (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/291-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Proxy-MADR cell lines: Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mT/mG” expressing tdTomato, Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mG” expressing EGFP, Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mScarlet” expressing mScarlet, and Neuro-2a Rosa26 “dark-PuroR” expressing puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (PAC). Scale bar, 50 μm. (B) Adapted with permission from Kim et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; copyright 2019 Elsevier.\nGeneration of EGFP-positive cells through Cre and Flp-mediated excision.\nNote: Cre-mediated excision is enough to get EGFP-positive cells. For this protocol Flp expression is suggested as well to get one FRT site in the locus to facilitate subsequent dRMCE (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPlate the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mT/mG” Proxy-MADR cells in a Poly-L-lysine coated plate and let them grow until they reach ∼60% confluency. See steps 1 and 2.\nUse Lipofectamine 3000 to transfect the pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV plasmid.\nMix 2,500 ng of the pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV plasmid.\nProceed with the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection described in steps 3b–3d.\nAdd the final suspension dropwise, directly into the media and incubate at 37°C for 24 h.\nAdd fresh medium and replace it every three days.",
    "EGFP-positive cells should be visualized under a fluorescent microscope 24 h post transfection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nExpand the cells and sort the EGFP-positive cells by FACS. Perform sorting as many times as necessary to have 100% EGFP-positive cells. See step 5. This cell line is now called Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mG” Proxy-MADR (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: In our experience 2 to 3 rounds of sorting by FACS is enough to achieve 100% purity.\nNote: Removing tdTomato from the mTmG-Neuro-2a Proxy-MADR cell line allows for the use of red fluorescent proteins as reporter transgenes.\nSwap the EGFP cassette of the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mG” Proxy-MADR cells with a new one containing a different transgene. In this protocol, a MADR pDonor containing a red fluorescent reporter, mScarlet, is used (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPlate the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mG” Proxy-MADR cells in a Poly-L-lysine coated plate and let them grow until they reach ∼60% confluency. See steps 1 and 2.\nUse Lipofectamine 3000 to transfect the pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and the MADR pDonor-mScarlet-3XSpot WPRE plasmids. The suggested ratio is 1:2 w/w, pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV: MADR pDonor-mScarlet-3XSpot WPRE.\nMix 800 ng of pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and 1,600 ng of MADR pDonor-mScarlet-3XSpot WPRE.\nProceed with the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection described in steps 3b–3d.\nAdd the final suspension dropwise, directly into the media and incubate at 37°C for 24 h.\nAdd fresh medium and replace it every three days.\nmScarlet-positive cells should be visualized under a fluorescent microscope 48 h post transfection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nExpand the cells and sort the mScarlet-positive cells by FACS. See step 5. This cell line is now called Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mScarlet” Proxy-MADR (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSwap the mScarlet cassette of the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mScarlet” Proxy-MADR cells with a new one containing a colorless transgene.",
    "Note: Cassettes can be swapped an unlimited number of times from any cell that contains the minimum requirements to perform MADR. As proof of principle in this protocol, swap the mScarlet cassette of the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mScarlet” Proxy-MADR cells using the MADR pDonor-rtTA-V10-AU1-P2a-puro-WPRE which contains a colorless puromycin resistance transgene, puromycin N-acetyltransferase (PAC) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPlate the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “mScarlet” Proxy-MADR cells in a Poly-L-lysine coated plate and let them grow until they reach ∼60% confluency. See steps 1 and 2.\nUse Lipofectamine 3000 to transfect the pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and the MADR pDonor-rtTA-V10-AU1-P2a-puro-WPRE plasmids. The suggested ratio is 1:2 w/w, pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV: MADR pDonor-rtTA-V10-AU1-P2a-puro-WPRE.\nMix 800 ng of pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and 1,600 ng of MADR pDonor-rtTA-V10-AU1-P2a-puro-WPRE.\nProceed with the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection described in steps 3b–3d.\nAdd the final suspension dropwise, directly into the media and incubate at 37°C for 24 h.\nAdd fresh medium and replace it every three days.\nColorless cells should be visualized 48 h post transfection.\nNote: Due to the lack of a fluorescent reporter transgene, the colorless cells can be hard to visualize among the fluorescent-positive cells. Expansion and puromycin selection of the cells will help to visualize them.\nExpand the cells for around 1 week and select them by adding puromycin to the culture media at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL.\nChange media every three days and add fresh puromycin for 2–3 weeks. This cell line is now called Neuro-2a Rosa26 “dark-PuroR” Proxy-MADR (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: The final concentration of puromycin depends on the cell type used, thus, a puromycin dose titration is highly suggested. It is also recommended to select the cells through FACS in case there are remaining fluorescent cells that developed resistance to puromycin.\nNote: The “dark-PuroR” Proxy-MADR cells are extremely helpful when selection through any fluorescent transgene is desired.",
    "Swap the colorless cassette of the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “dark-PuroR” Proxy-MADR cells for any cassette containing a visible reporter transgene.\nNote: One of the main advantages of the colorless Proxy-MADR cells is that there is a broad spectrum of reporter transgenes that can be used to select the desired cells. In this protocol, we show the utility of the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “dark-PuroR” Proxy-MADR cells through the transfection of three MADR pDonors each containing a different fluorescent reporter transgene and the transfection of one MADR pDonor containing two fluorescent reporter transgenes in the same cassette (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/291-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Scale bar, 50 μm.\nPlate the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “dark-PuroR” Proxy-MADR cells in a Poly-L-lysine coated plate and let them grow until they reach ∼60% confluency. See steps 1 and 2.\nUse Lipofectamine 3000 to transfect the pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre-EV and the respective MADR pDonors. The suggested ratio is 1:2 w/w, pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre-EV: MADR pDonor.\nMix 350 ng of pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and 700 ng of each of the following plasmids: MADR pDonor-TagBFP2-3xFlag (cyto) WPRE, MADR pDonor smFP-myc (bright) WPRE, and MADR pDonor-mScarlet-3XSpot WPRE.\nNote: The MADR pDonor smFP-myc (bright) WPRE contains a cassette that codes for a “spaghetti monster” fluorescent protein (smFP) with multiple Myc tags that also emits GFP fluorescence (Viswanathan et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nMix 800 ng of pCAG-FlpO-2A-Cre EV and 1,600 ng of MADR pDonor-PIP-NLS-mVenus-P2A-mCherry-hGEM1/110.",
    "Note: The MADR pDonor-PIP-NLS-mVenus-P2A-mCherry-hGEM1/110 plasmid contains a cassette with two reporter transgenes, mVenus and mCherry. Expression is dependent on the cell cycle phase. See Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) (Grant et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7];  Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nProceed with the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection as described in steps 3b–3d.\nAdd the final suspension dropwise into to their respective cell culture, directly into the media and incubate at 37°C for 24 h.\nAdd fresh medium and replace it every three days.\nConfirm the expression of the MADR pDonors under a fluorescent microscope.\nLook for blue, red, and green signals in the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “dark-PuroR” Proxy-MADR cells that were transfected with the three MADR pDonors (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nNote: We have realized that SM-Myc-Bright is not as bright as EGFP, thus, performing immunocytochemistry (ICC) is helpful to identify if cells integrated the cassette.\nLook for green and red signals in the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “dark-PuroR” Proxy-MADR cells transfected with the MADR pDonor Green-Red-FUCCI. Expand the cells and sort the mVenus and mCherry-positive cells by FACS. See step 5. This cell line is now called Neuro-2a Rosa26 “Green-Red-FUCCI” Proxy-MADR (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nValidation of Green-Red-FUCCI System on Proxy-MADR Cells\nTiming: 4 days\nThe purpose of this step is to validate the FUCCI system in Proxy-MADR cells. Live-cell time-lapse imaging of proliferating cells is a great method for studying cell cycle dynamics and it can be used to validate FUCCI which is a good system to identify cell cycle phases.\nLive-cell time-lapse imaging of Neuro-2a Rosa26 “Green-Red-FUCCI” Proxy-MADR cells.\nAdd enough Poly-L-lysine to coat a 96-well plate (100 μL per well). See step 1.\nCritical: It is highly recommended to coat any plate to maintain cell attachment for easier visualization.\nPlate ∼10,000 Neuro-2a Rosa26 “Green-Red-FUCCI” Proxy-MADR cells and let them grow at least 24 h before imaging.",
    "In this protocol, the Incucyte S3 System and 20× objective were used to take images under phase, green, and red fluorescence. Images were taken every 30 min for 40 h.\nNote: The image collection time depends on the cell type, fluorescence channels, number of plates, etc. We recommend standardizing the proper time collection.\nFor this protocol, Incucyte S3 Software and ImageJ were used to collect and process live-cell time-lapse imaging of the Neuro-2a Rosa26 “Green-Red-FUCCI” Proxy-MADR cells (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n              \nMethods Video S1.\nTime-Lapse Imaging of Neuro-2a Rosa26 “Green-Red FUCCI” Proxy-MADR\nCells Phase, green, and red fluorescence channels on the left panel.
