    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDesign of sgRNA and preparation of sgRNA expression vector\nTiming: ∼1 week\nDesign sgRNA sequence and clone it into pX330 vector. For general information of pX330 vector and sgRNA design, please refer to Ran et al. (2013).2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] Here, we specifically explain how to decide the sgRNA for C-terminal tagging and to clone it into the pX330 vector.\nTo obtain the sequence information of RIF1, go to Ensembl genome browser (https://www.ensembl.org[href=https://www.ensembl.org/]).\nSearch for your gene of interest (in this example: RIF1). Choose “Human” in “Species”. Click “Go” then select “RIF1 (Human Gene)”.\nChoose the Gold-colored transcript that is annotated as Ensembl canonical transcript.\nNote: The table shows different transcripts of RIF1.\nClick the Ensembl link in the “Protein” column, i.e., “2472aa”.\nNote: The transcript information will then be displayed on the top.\nClick the Ensembl link in “About this transcript” stating the number of exons, i.e., “36 exons” (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2719-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Obtain sequence information from Ensembl genome browser\n(A) Choose the correct transcript (arrow 1) and then click “exons” (arrow 2).\n(B) To configure the display, click “Configure this page” (arrow 3). Show full intronic sequences (arrow 4) and remove all annotations (arrow 5).\n(C) Identify the stop codon in the last exon (arrow 6).\nThe “Exons” table is below the transcript table. Sequences of exons and introns of RIF1 gene are shown. The nucleotides are heavily annotated. You can remove the annotations by clicking “Configurate this page” on the left (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nIn “Configure Page”, click “show full intronic sequence” to get the full sequence information of all introns. Select “No” in “Show variants” to remove annotations of the nucleotides (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nGo to the last exon of RIF1 and identify the stop codon (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).",
    "Note: The 5′/3′ upstream/downstream sequences are in green. The untranslated regions in exons are in red. The coding sequences are in blue and capital letters. The intron sequences are in grey and small letters.\nCopy ∼100 bp sequence with the stop codon in the middle and search for sgRNA sequence using online sgRNA design website, e.g., CHOPCHOP v34[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]: http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/[href=http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/] (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nNote: If there are multiple sgRNAs available in the 100 bp region, you can choose the one with higher ranking, which is defined primarily by the number of off-targets and efficiency. In addition, you can choose the one with target cleavage site closer to the stop codon, as the recombination efficiency will be higher if the induced DNA break is closer to the stop codon.\nIdentify the sgRNA target site for RIF1 C-terminal tagging: CCCATGAAAATTCTATTTAGTAT.\nNote: sgRNA will target the complementary strand, CCC is the PAM site. TAG is the stop codon. Therefore, the sgRNA sense sequence is 5′-ATACTAAATAGAATTTTCAT-3′.\nOrder a pair of DNA oligos in a commercial company (e.g., Integrated DNA Technologies), and add overhangs that are required for cloning into pX330:\n5′-CACCGATACTAAATAGAATTTTCAT-3′ (sense)\n5′-AAACATGAAAATTCTATTTAGTATC-3′ (antisense)\nResuspend the DNA oligos.\nSpin down the oligo tubes in a benchtop microcentrifuge with maximum speed (∼16,000 g) for ∼ 1 min.\nPipette in the volume of 1× TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA) required for 100 μM.\nAnneal the oligos by performing the following reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2719_2.csv\nBoil the mixture at 95°C for 5 min, then cool down the mixture stepwise: 70°C for 10 min, 50°C for 10 min, 37°C for 10 min, and finally 25°C for 10 min.\nNote: You can do the cooling step in a PCR machine.",
    "Dilute the annealed oligos in ddH2O at 1:200, then clone it into pX330 vector by the following reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2719_3.csv\nIncubate the mixture in a PCR machine. Set the program at 37°C for 5 min then 21°C for 5 min, for 6 cycles.\nTransform 1–2 μL of the mixture to DH5α competent cells following the manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/18258012[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/18258012]. Spread the transformation mixture to LB-agar plates with 50 μg/mL ampicillin.\nPick a few colonies to grow and mini-prep DNA using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit following manufacturer’s protocol: https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/qiaprep-spin-miniprep-kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/qiaprep-spin-miniprep-kit]\nUse U6 primer (5′-GAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATTCC-3′) to sequence the purified plasmids to check if the sgRNA sequence is successfully ligated.\nNote: Sequence 5–6 plasmids from different clones, the percentage of successful plasmids is high, usually > 50% using the reaction in step 8.\nCritical: The target site of the sgRNA should be close to the stop codon, ideally within 50 bp. It is because the efficiency of the homologous recombination reduces when the Cas9-mediated double-stranded break is moving further apart from the stop codon.\nPreparation of the homologous repair templates for endogenous tagging\nTiming: ∼1 week\nIn this step, we describe how to design the homology arms and how to clone the homology arms into the C-terminal tagging vectors with antibiotic resistance markers (i.e., pMK289 and pMK289-BleoR). For information about the tagging vector, please refer to Natsume et al. (2016).3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nGo to the Ensembl Exons table of RIF1. Copy ∼200 bp sequence before and ∼200 bp sequence after the stop codon.\nATATAATTGATCCTGTTGCTTTAGAAATTCCATTATCCAAAAACCTTCTGGCACAGATTAGTGCTCTTGCTCTTCAGCTGGATTCAGAAGATCTTCATAATTATTCAGGAAGCCAACTATTTGAAATGCACGAGAAACTAAGTTGTATGGCAAACTCTGTAATAAAAAATCTACAGTCACGTTGGAGATCACCATCCCATGAAAATTCTATTTAGTATTTTCAGAGAAAATTGAAGGTTTTTTTAAACATCACTGGATTTCTTGATTGAGGAAACAAGTTCTGAAATAATAGCACAATTTCAAAGAAGAGACTCTTTGCAAAGTTGATAACATTTCAAACCCTGAAGGACAGTGACTTATTATGTAAGTTCAATTTTGTAAGTTCATTATGTAAGATCCTTTTTTTTTTCATAATAT\nNote: The target site of sgRNA is italicized, the PAM site and stop codon are in bold.",
    "Note: The homology arm is usually 200–800 bp long. Increasing the length of homology arms is known to increase on-target insertion.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] For gene targeting in HCT116 cells, we use 200 bp-long of homology arm. If you are using other cell lines, you may need to increase the length of the homology arms to increase the efficiency of recombination repair.\nReplace the stop codon with a BamHI site:\nATATAATTGATCCTGTTGCTTTAGAAATTCCATTATCCAAAAACCTTCTGGCACAGATTAGTGCTCTTGCTCTTCAGCTGGATTCAGAAGATCTTCATAATTATTCAGGAAGCCAACTATTTGAAATGCACGAGAAACTAAGTTGTATGGCAAACTCTGTAATAAAAAATCTACAGTCACGTTGGAGATCACCATCCCATGAAAATTCTATTGGATCCTATTTTCAGAGAAAATTGAAGGTTTTTTTAAACATCACTGGATTTCTTGATTGAGGAAACAAGTTCTGAAATAATAGCACAATTTCAAAGAAGAGACTCTTTGCAAAGTTGATAACATTTCAAACCCTGAAGGACAGTGACTTATTATGTAAGTTCAATTTTGTAAGTTCATTATGTAAGATCCTTTTTTTTTTCATAATAT\nCritical: The homology arm sequences should not contain BamHI site (GGATCC). Mutate the BamHI site if any, but it has a potential to introduce cryptic splice site.\nCheck if “TAG” to “GGATCC” mutation would disrupt the binding of sgRNA to the target site. If the target site is still intact, mutate the PAM site in the repair template to ‘NGT’, ‘NGA’, or ‘NGC’ (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nOrder the designed sequence in a cloning vector via a standard gene synthesis service (e.g., Thermo Fisher GeneArt gene synthesis).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2719-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cloning of the homologous repair templates\n(A) The cloning vector with homology arms.\n(B) pMK289 and pMK289-BleoR. pMK289 is available from Addgene. pMK289-BleoR is generated by replacing NeoR gene to BleoR gene.\n(C) The correct homologous repair template.\nNote: The cloning vector should not contain any BamHI site (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nCut pMK289 and pMK289-BleoR with BamHI and ScaI with the following reaction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2719_4.csv\nThere will be three DNA bands in DNA gel. The DNA band with ∼3 kb in length is the fragment containing mAID, GFP and NeoR/BleoR.\nCut and gel purify the ∼3 kb band (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) using the GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher). Please follow the manufacturer’s instructions: https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/K0691[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/K0691].\nDNA is eluted with 30 μL of elution buffer.\nMeasure the concentration of the DNA by a NanoDrop.\nCut the plasmid containing the homology arms with BamHI with the following reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2719_5.csv",
    "Note: Quick CIP is added to the reaction to remove the phosphates from the DNA ends. This will prevent self-ligation of the linearized vector.\nGel-purify the linearized plasmid and ligate it with the ∼3 kb fragment from pMK289 or pMK289-BleoR with the following reaction:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2719_6.csv\nIncubate the reaction mix at 25°C for 10 min.\nNote: The molar ratio between the insert (3 kb fragment from pMK289) and vector (linearized plasmid with homology arms) should be around 3:1.\nSelect bacterial clones with correct recombinant plasmids.\nTransform 1–2 μL of the ligation mixture to DH5α competent cells (see step 9).\nPick several colonies, mini-prep DNA (see step 10).\nCheck the plasmids by Sanger sequencing using a primer priming at the left homology arm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nThe correct plasmid will be transformed to DH5α competent cells again for midi-prep using Qiagen Plasmid Plus kit following the manufacturer’s protocol: https://www.qiagen.com/be/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/qiagen-plasmid-plus-kits[href=https://www.qiagen.com/be/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/qiagen-plasmid-plus-kits].\nCritical: If the stop codon is not within the target site of the sgRNA, the PAM site needs to be mutated to prevent cleavage by Cas9. Alternatively, mutations can also be introduced in the 20 bp protospacer to prevent cutting.\nGeneration of cells with endogenous tagging at RIF1 gene\nTiming: ∼1 month\nIn this step, you need a cell line expressing OsTIR1 if you want the mAID-tagged protein to be degraded upon the addition of auxin. Please refer to Natsume et al. (2016)3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] for how to generate OsTIR1-expressing cells.\nQuickly thaw a vial of frozen HCT116-OsTIR1 cells in a 37°C water bath for 1–2 min.\nDilute the thawed cells with ∼10 mL pre-warmed growth medium.\nPlate them into a 10 cm cell culture dish.\nLet them recover for several passages.",
    "Seed ∼2 × 105 cells to a 60 mm culture dish 24 h before DNA transfection. One hour before transfection, change the medium of the dish.\nSet up the following transfection mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2719_7.csv\nIncubate the transfection mixture at 25°C for 20 min before adding to the cells dropwise. Mix gently by rocking the dish back and forth.\n48 h later, trypsinize cells using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and transfer them to a 100 mm plate with 10 mL medium. Add 100 μg/mL of zeocin and 500 μg/mL of geneticin to cells.\nNote: The concentrations of zeocin (100 μg/mL) and geneticin (500 μg/mL) stated here are optimized for HCT116 cells. For other cell lines, the concentrations should be optimized. Similarly, the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection protocol described here works well in HCT116 cells (> 80% transfection efficiency), but if you are using different cells, the transfection protocol needs to be optimized.\nChange medium every 3–4 days and add zeocin and geneticin continuously. After ∼2 weeks, you can observe a few cell colonies grow on the dish.\nPick 15–20 colonies directly by using a 1000 mL pipette trip and transfer each cell colony to a well (with medium) in a 12-well plate (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nNote: Single-cell clones should be discernable via microscope. They should have round edges. Don’t pick clones of multiple-cell origin. Please refer to Zhong et al. (2020)6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] for how to select single-cell clones.\nNote: Alternative methods to isolate single-cell clones include single cell sorting using flow cytometry, or single cell seeding into 96 well plate.\nLet the cells grow and expand. Then collect cells from each colony for verification to see if any of them has tagged biallelically (see below).\nMake frozen stocks of each clone.",
    "Trypsinize cells and resuspend the cell pellet (∼1–2 × 106 cells) with 1 mL of 90% FBS + 10% DMSO and transfer the cell suspension into cryogenic tubes.\nPlace the cryogenic tubes in an isopropanol-filled freezing container and transfer it to −70°C for more than 16 h.\nNote: The knock-in efficiency is usually quite high. For cell clones that survive two antibiotics selection, 10%–30% of them show successful knock-in.\nDetect biallelic tagging in any of the clones\nTiming: ∼1 week\nTo detect successful tagging in any of the cell clones, you can first check the expression of the tagged proteins. In this case, you can detect if the cells express RIF1-GFP by western blot. However, there is a possibility that only one allele of RIF1 is tagged. In this step, genomic DNA of the cells is extracted to allow verification by PCR to check if biallelic tagging is achieved.\nHarvest ∼1 × 106 cells and extract their genomic DNA using Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol: https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit].\nNote: Purify genomic DNA from the parental cells as control.\nDesign and order three PCR primers, P1, P2 and P3 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2719-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Verification of biallelic tagging by PCR\n(A) Positions of primers P1, P2 and P3 designed to confirm biallelic tagging of RIF1.\n(B) PCR results of WT cells, cells tagged only in one allele and biallelically tagged cells.\nNote: P1 primer (forward) is 5′-GTTGCTTTAGAAATTCCATTATC-3′, which primes ∼200 bp before the stop codon of RIF1. P2 primer (reverse) is 5′-CCTTCAATTTTCTCTGAAAATAC-3′, which primes at the stop codon. P3 primer (reverse) is 5′-TATGGCTGATTATGATCAGT-3′, which primes at the end of GFP.",
    "Note: As least one of the primer sites must be outside of the homology arm in the DNA repair plasmid. It is because even a small amount of episomal plasmid DNA will result in false positive result in the PCR test in cell clones that do not have successful tagging.\nPCR using P1 and P2 primers gives ∼200 bp products using genomic DNA from parental cells as the template, but no products will be formed using P1 and P3 primers (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nPCR using P1 and P2 primers gives no product using genomic DNA from biallelic tagged cells as the template, but ∼1 kb products would be generated when using P1 and P3 primers.\nNote: Successful tagging would disrupt P2 priming. If both ∼200 bp and ∼1 kb products can be seen, then the clone is tagged in only single allele (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B) (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nSet up the PCR reaction as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2719_8.csv\nPCR cycling condition:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2719_9.csv\nNote: The extension rate of Q5 polymerase is ∼20–30 sec per kb. For calculation of the annealing temperature, you can use the manufacturer’s Tm calculator: https://tmcalculator.neb.com/[href=https://tmcalculator.neb.com/]\nRun the PCR products in 1.2% agarose gel to detect the size of the products (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSend the PCR products to Sanger sequencing to verify and confirm that the PCR products are indeed the expected tagging sequence.\nTo confirm the tagging is functional, treat cells with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) at 250 μM to induce degradation of RIF1-mAID-GFP and then detect the protein by western blotting (see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nTo show that the tagged protein is also functional, conduct immunofluorescence using anti-GFP antibody to detect if the tagged proteins display expected localization (See expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes])."
