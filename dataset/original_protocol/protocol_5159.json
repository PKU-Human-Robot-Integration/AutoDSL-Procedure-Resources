    "Plant growth and microscope slide preparationSurface sterilize seeds in 5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite for 5 min in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (inverting ~10 times) and then rinse three times in sterile distilled water.Plate the seeds on to Murashige and Skoog medium (pH 5.8) supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.5% (w/v) phytagel.Stratify the seeds by incubating for 2 days at 4 °C in darkness. Then, seedlings were grown at 22 ± 1 °C, in vertically oriented Petri dishes for at least 5 days (16 h light and 8 h dark).Fixation and preparation of Arabidopsis roots (see Figure 2 for an overview)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170410/20170410020002_8111.jpgFigure 2. Protocol steps for smFISH in Arabidopsis root cells. See main text for details. Cut root tips from Arabidopsis seedlings (approx. 1 cm) whilst still on plates and place into a small glass dish containing freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde and incubate for 30 min at room temperature under a fume hood.Remove the roots from the fixative and wash twice with 1x PBS.Arrange 3-4 roots onto a slide and cover with a coverslip. Gently squash each root onto the slide using either your thumb and be careful to avoid breaking the coverslip. Aim to splay the roots sufficiently to produce multiple files and isolated cells in a single cell layer (see Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170410/20170410020125_9538.jpgFigure 3. Low magnification image a root meristem squash. Nuclei stained with DAPI (blue). This method yields many single-layer cells that are either isolated or within files. Scale bar = 200 μm.Use tweezers to hold the squashed roots under the coverslip and immerse each slide in liquid nitrogen for ~5 sec. After removal from the nitrogen, ease a razor blade between the coverslip and the slide and flick the coverslip off. Leave samples to air dry at room temperature for a minimum of 30 min.",
    "Note: To avoid increased levels of autofluorescence do not leave to dry for longer than 2 h.Permeabilize the samples by immersing the slides into a Coplin jar containing 70% ethanol for a minimum of one hour at room temperature. Fixed roots can be stored at 2 to 8 °C in 70% ethanol up to a week prior to hybridization. Probe hybridizationRemove slides from the ethanol and allow residual ethanol to evaporate at room temperature.Wash 2 times on the slide with wash buffer for 5 min.Prepare a probe solution by adding 1 μl of each required probe stock solution to 100 μl of hybridization solution (250 nM final concentration). Add 100 μl probe solution to each slide, cover with a coverslip to prevent evaporation and incubate in a humid chamber at 37 °C for a minimum of 4 h (or overnight) in the dark. Sample mountingRemove the cover slip and wash the samples 2 times in 200 μl wash buffer for 5 min on the slide.Immerse the slide in a Coplin jar containing ~30 ml of wash buffer and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C, in the dark.Remove the slide from the jar and add 100 μl of DAPI solution to the slide then incubate at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark.Aspirate the DAPI solution carefully with a pipette and rinse with ~100 μl 2x SSC.Remove 2x SSC and add 100 μl anti-fade GLOX buffer (minus enzymes). Leave it to equilibrate for 1-2 min. Remove anti-fade GLOX buffer (minus enzymes) and add 100 μl of anti-fade GLOX buffer (containing enzymes) to each slide.Cover the samples with a coverslip, remove excess anti-fade GLOX buffer (plus enzymes) and seal with nail varnish.Image the slides the same day to avoid sample drying and fluorophore fading.",
    "ImagingImages are acquired on a wide-field epifluorescence microscope, with an optical sectioning size of 0.2 μm per z-plane and spanning the entire volume of the cell (around 5 μm, depending on cell size). Exposure times will vary depending on your microscope setup (light source, objective, etc.). We acquired our images using a Zeiss Elyra PS with a 100x oil-immersion objective (1.46 NA) and a cooled electron multiplying-CCD (charge-coupled device) Andor iXon 897 camera (512 x 512, QE > 90%). For probes labeled with Quasar 570 an excitation line of 561 nm was used and signals were detected at 570-640 nm; for probes labelled with Quasar 670 an excitation line of 642 nm and signals were detected at 655-710 nm; for DAPI an excitation line of 405 nm and signals were detected at wavelengths of 420-480 nm. Typically, we used 30 msec exposure time for DAPI, and 200-300 msec for Quasar dyes.After image acquisition, Z-stacks can be reduced to a 2D dataset using the maximum projection command in ImageJ (Image/Stack/Z Project). For a detailed description of this step please refer to ImageJ User Guide available at: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/user-guide.pdf[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/user-guide.pdf]. The maximum projection command will result in an image with diffraction-limited spots corresponding to single RNAs. When exonic probes are used in conjunction with intronic probes for the same gene, some spots will co-localize within nuclei, corresponding to nascent RNA molecules that were being transcribed at the time of fixation (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170410/20170410020531_9711.jpgFigure 4. Detection of FLC transcripts in single cells. A. Schematic of the probes used to detect FLC transcripts: intronic (red) and exonic (green). FLC exons are represented as thick lines and introns shown as thin lines. B. Representative image showing FLC mRNA (green) and FLC nascent RNA (red) expression in Arabidopsis thaliana root cells.",
    "The diffraction-limited spots in the cytoplasm correspond to single FLC mRNA molecules (green), and the intense spots co-localizing with intronic signals (red) correspond to transcription sites. Depending on the cell cycle stage one can detect up to 2 dots (G1 phase) or 4 dots (G2 phase) for the intronic signals. The nucleus is stained with DAPI and shown in blue. Scale bar = 5 μm."
