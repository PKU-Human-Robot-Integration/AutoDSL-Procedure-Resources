    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHydrodynamic injection\nTiming: 1 day\nPlease see the Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for the detailed operation.\nMix the SB and pT3-Myc-P2A-Cre-T2A-EGFP plasmids together with 0.9% saline (SB: 1 μg/mL, pT3:10 μg/mL).\nNote: Prepare about 2 mL DNA solution (containing 20 μg pT3 plasmids and 2 μg SB plasmids) for each mouse, and each group should contain more than 5 mice. So we suggest preparing DNA solution between 10 mL to 15 mL for each group.\nNote: If the goal is to test the effectiveness of the drug in treating liver cancer, inject the mice with pT3-Myc-P2A-Cre-T2A-EGFP and SB plasmid. If it is to test the function of the genes of interest in liver tumorigenesis, inject pT3-Myc-P2A-Cre-T2A-EGFP or pT3-Myc-geneX-P2A-Cre-T2A-EGFP along with SB plasmids.\nNote: From this step, keep aseptic operations unless otherwise indicated.\nCritical: The saline must be sterile, otherwise it will decrease the survival rate of mice. See Troubleshooting 2.\nCritical: Thaw the plasmids at 65°C before use, otherwise the plasmid with high concentration will be too sticky to pipet.\nTake 10 μL solution and coat it to bacterial colony culture dish which is without bacteria and antibiotics for sterility test. We can go to next step as long as there are not colony growths on the dish.\nPipet and vortex the mixture. Maintain mixture at 20°C–25°C for half an hour prior to injection.\nSterilize the devices with 75% alcohol in accordance with SPF procedure.\nEnter the mouse room with prepared reagents and devices (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/584-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Heat lamp.\nTake the mice, devices and reagents to the operation room.\nWeigh the mouse aged at 6 weeks and record their weight.\nNote: The weight of 6-week-old female mouse is about 20 g.\nCritical: Eliminate mouse weighting over 25 g. See Troubleshooting 5.\nPlace a needle from 1 mL syringe on 2 mL syringe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/584-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Detailed procedure of hydrodynamic injection\n(A) Picture of 2 mL syringe with a needle from 1 mL syringe.\n(B) Picture of mouse under a heat lamp to make its tail vein visualized.\n(C) Picture of mouse with its lateral side of tail vein up.\n(D) Picture showing blood backflow into the needle at the injection time.\nLoad the syringe with the DNA solution [10% (volume/body weight)]. For example: a 20 g mouse will be injected with 2 mL of DNA solution.\nNote: The operator should put on the goggles before using the syringe to protect eyes.\nRemove the air from the syringe by tapping it and pressing the plunger slowly, then put syringe aside until injection.\nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane-loaded anaesthesia machine.\nOptional: The mice also can be anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with anesthetic. If you choose this way, the mouse should be anesthetized between steps 7 and 8.\nPlace the tail of the mouse under a heat lamp for 1 min until the lateral vein of the mouse tail is visualized (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Note: This step will increase the vascular volume of the tail and make the injection easier. If the mouse’s tail vein is easy to distinguish, skip to next step.\nCritical: Do not overheat the mice. When noticing the mice hide in the corners of the cage, adjust the height of the lamp to the cage or close the lamp for a while.\nPlace the mouse into the restrainer tube and wipe the tail with an alcohol pad.\nAdjust the position of mice until the lateral side of tail is up (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nInject the needle into the vein at the site of 2 cm from the tip of the tail.\nCritical: If you are not sure that you can succeed at the first time, it is strongly recommended to inject from the tip of the tail. Once the needle is in the wrong position, adjust it to the upper position and continue to inject.\nCritical: Turn the needle to keep the bevel points up and make the scales on the syringe barrel visible.\nOnce you see a blood backflow into the needle, press on plunger of the syringe evenly (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCritical: The plunger usually moves smoothly. But if the plunger does not move easily, remove the needle and reinsert it up to the previous injection site and continue. If all of the attempt is made, try the opposite side of the tail.\nCritical: If the plunger stops moving before the injection has been finished, this mouse should be removed from your experiment. Because this delivery will not be efficient as others.\nControl the whole injection time within 4–8 s. See Troubleshooting 3.\nWhen finished, remove the needle and press on the injection site until the bleeding stops.",
    "Repeat steps 7–18 with the next mouse and record the accurate injection volume and date. See Troubleshooting 1.\nNote: Several mice without injection should be kept as negative control.\nPut the mouse to the recovery cage at 37°C until they are recovered to normal activity.\nNote: The mice will be recovered within about 30 min after hydrodynamic injection.\nMonitor the health status of the mice after injection.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods video S1. Hydrodynamic injection, related to steps 7–20\nDetection of the efficiency of DNA delivery and insertion\nTiming: 2–3 days\nOne week after injection, the injected DNA should have inserted into chromosome and express Cre protein to induce knockout of Mst1 (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/584-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Scale bar, 50 μm.\nDay 1\nFill the 1.5 mL sonication tubes with a mix of two kinds of protein extraction beads (five beads each type; see Key Resources Table).\nAdd protease inhibitor cocktail (100× stock) to the cold protein extraction buffer to get a 1× dilution.\nAdd 500 μL cold protein extraction buffer to the tubes with beads.\nTake two mice from each group (including blank control group) to detect their expression of target genes in liver.\nWeigh mice and calculate the dosage of anesthetic [10 fold (volume/body weight)]. For example, inject 200 μL anesthetic for a 20 g mouse.\nNote: We use 5% chloral hydrate dissolved in ddH2O (m/v) as anesthetic.\nInject anesthetic intraperitoneally and wait for 5 min until the mouse is fully anesthetized.\nSeparate the liver from the mouse quickly.",
    "Note: In order to obtain a complete liver tissue, firstly, fully expose the liver by cutting along the mid-abdomen of the mouse, and then cut the connective tissue between the liver and the thoracic diaphragm, stomach and intestines. Dissected tissues can be frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nCritical: Minimize the time of tissue collection to prevent protein degradation.\nPut a piece of the liver tissue into cold 500 μL protein extraction buffer (with fresh proteinase inhibitor cocktail).\nExtract the proteins with a high-speed tissue homogenizer.\nNote: We recommend the speed of 4 m/s with 2 cycles of 15 s on and 15 s off for liver.\nCritical: In order to prevent the sample from overheating and protein degradation, put the sample on ice as soon as possible after homogenization.\nTake 100 μL protein sample and boil it at 100°C for 10 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge all of the samples at 16,800 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant containing soluble proteins to a new tube and take an aliquot for protein quantification.\nDays 2–3\nAnalyze the expression of Cre, eGFP and Myc-tagged geneX by Western blotting. GAPDH is used as a control (work dilution: 1:10000).\nOptional: The expression efficiency also can be detected by immunohistochemistry staining of the livers with GFP antibody (work dilution: 1:200) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nIntraperitoneal drug injection (optional)\nTiming: 6 weeks\nPrepare sterile drugs and vehicle (control) to be injected.\nNote: The drugs are recommended to be stored in sterile multi-dose vials.\nNote: Optimize the concentration of drugs before use.\nOptional: Prepare drugs that can inhibit liver tumorigenesis as positive control.\nLoad the 1 mL syringe with drugs.\nTake the mouse (injected with pT3-Myc-P2A-Cre-T2A-EGFP and SB plasmids) from the cage and restrain it gently.",
    "Insert needle with bevel point and the numbers on the syringe barrel facing up, and inject the mouse with a volume about 100 μL.\nCritical: Control the insertion depth of needle to avoid damage to the abdominal organs.\nPress the injection site until the bleeding stops.\nInject the mouse with drug one by one.\nChange the syringe with different drugs.\nRepeat steps 35–41 once a week for 6 weeks (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/584-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic diagram of sleeping beauty model\nNote: The frequency and duration of drug injection can be optimized.\nAnalysis of mouse liver tumors\nTiming: 1 day\nInject anesthetic intraperitoneally and wait for 5 min until the mouse is fully anesthetized.\nWeigh and record the whole body of mice.\nDissect the liver from the mouse quickly.\nCritical: Put the mouse liver in the cold PBS from this step.\nWeigh the dissected liver and record.\nRepeat steps 43–46.\nCount the liver tumors and measure the tumor diameter with calipers.\nNote: According to tumor size, tumors are classified into two grades: grade I represents the tumor with a diameter of less than 5 mm, and grade II represents the tumor with a diameter of more than 5mm.\nTake a picture of the liver with a ruler (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/584-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

The black dotted line points out the area of liver with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Scale bars, 500 μm.\nTake a piece of liver for protein sample extraction.",
    "Perform statistical analysis of liver-over-body weight ratio and tumor size of each group (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nTest the expression of delivered genes by Western blotting.\nMake paraffin-embedded 5 μm sections using the rest of the liver.\nStain the slides with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) for histologic examination (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C)."
