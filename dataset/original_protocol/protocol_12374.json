    "NOTE: All experimental procedures were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Cryopreservation and Fixation of Embryonic Mouse Hearts.\n1.1) Snap-freezing embryonic hearts\nFill a 3.5 cm petri dish and 7 mm cryomolds with Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) medium (see Materials Table). In a chemical hood, cool 2-methylbutane in liquid nitrogen.\nDispense 30 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into 10 cm petri dishes, 10 ml of PBS into 3.5 cm petri dishes, and place all petri dishes on ice. Prepare one 10 cm dish and several 3.5 cm dishes per pregnant mouse.\nIsolate embryos as previously described15, performing the dissection in ice-cold PBS.\nBriefly, euthanize the pregnant female using CO2 narcosis and cervical dislocation.\n\t\nMake an incision in the abdomen, dissect out the uterus by cutting the vessels along the inner curvature of the uterus, and transfer the uterus to a 10 cm petri dish containing ice-cold PBS.\nCut the uterus in between each embryo and transfer to an individual 3.5 cm Petri dish containing ice-cold PBS. Isolate each embryo as described15.\nOpen the pericardial cavity using fine forceps, remove the heart away from the lungs and vasculature by cutting at the aorta, inferior vena cava, and pulmonary veins, and transfer into the 3.5 cm petri dish containing OCT.\nLet the heart equilibrate in OCT for several seconds, then transfer the heart into the 7 mm mold containing OCT. Orient the anterior wall of the heart to the bottom of the mold.\nGently place the mold into liquid nitrogen-cooled 2-methylbutane. Take care not to allow 2-methylbutane liquid to touch the OCT or heart. Freeze until the OCT is solid white, then transfer the mold to an ice bucket containing dry ice. Move on to the next embryo.",
    "Wrap cryomolds in foil and store at -80 °C until ready for cryosectioning.\n1.2) Alternative: Paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixing, cryoprotecting, and OCT embedding embryonic hearts\nFill the wells of a 12-well tissue culture plate with 4% PFA in 1x PBS.\nDissect out the embryonic hearts as described in 1.1.3. Place each heart into a well containing 4% PFA and fix at 4 °C O/N.\nCryoprotection: using a plastic transfer pipette, move each heart to an 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1.5 ml of 15% sucrose in PBS and gently agitate at 4 °C until the heart sinks to the bottom of the tube (several hours to O/N). Transfer each heart to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1.5ml of 30% sucrose in PBS and gently agitate at 4 °C again until the heart sinks to the bottom of the tube (several hours to O/N).\nUsing a plastic transfer pipette, place the cryoprotected heart into OCT and let it equilibrate for several minutes to remove excess sucrose, then transfer the heart into the 7 mm mold containing OCT. Orient the anterior wall of the heart to the bottom of the mold.\nFreeze the heart in OCT by placing the mold in either liquid nitrogen-cooled 2-methylbutane or dry ice.\nWrap cryomolds in foil and store at -80 °C until ready for cryosectioning.\n2. Cryosectioning\nSet cryostat temperature to -17 °C.\nPlace cryomolds into the cryostat chamber and equilibrate to temperature for 15-20 min.\nInvert the cryomold and use gentle pressure to expel the heart block from the mold. Orient the anterior wall of the heart to the top of the molded tissue block.",
    "Place a large drop of OCT onto the chuck, and mount the heart block onto the OCT drop to freeze onto the chuck. Keep the orientation such that the anterior wall of the heart is furthest from the chuck.\nLoad the chuck and mounted heart block onto the cryostat object holder. Adjust so that the angle of the blade is 3-5° relative to the sample.\nCollect 10 µm sections onto microscope slides that have been pre-treated with a positively charged coating (see Materials Table). Allow to dry completely before storing at -80 °C.\n3. Immunofluorescence\nFor snap-frozen sections, fix and permeabilize tissue in acetone for 10 min in a fume hood at RT.\nFor snap-frozen and PFA-fixed sections, incubate in PBS-0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min to remove OCT and to permeabilize PFA-fixed sections.\nBlock for 45 min in 1x blocking buffer, diluted in PBS.\nIf using a primary antibody generated in mouse, incubate in donkey or goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) monovalent Fab fragment diluted 1:100 in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 for 45 min at RT (see Discussion).\nIncubate in primary antibody or antibodies diluted in 1x blocking buffer for 2 hr at RT or O/N at 4 °C (see Table of Materials/Equipment for specific dilutions).\nWash sections in 1x PBS three times for 10 min at RT.\nIncubate in Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer for 2 hr at RT, protected from light.\nWash sections in 1x PBS three times for 10 min at RT, protected from light.\nOptional: Incubate in Hoechst dye diluted 1:2,000 in PBS at RT (protected from light) to label nuclei, then rinse with PBS.\nPost-fix labeled sections in 1% PFA for 1 min at RT.",
    "Mount slides in anti-fade medium (with DAPI if nuclei are not already labeled) by placing two drops of medium on each end of the slide and then covering with a coverslip. Seal coverslips with nail polish. Store protected from light at 4 °C until ready to image.\n4. Confocal Imaging and Image Analysis\nTurn on the appropriate laser wavelengths, camera, and confocal microscope including stage mover and z motor. Launch the imaging software program. Use the 405, 488, and 561 laser wavelengths for imaging Hoechst-, Alexa 488-, and Alexa 568-stained sections, respectively.\n\tNOTE: See Materials Table for our hardware and software specifications.\nMount the control slide (coverslip down for an inverted microscope) on the slide stage.\nUsing the 4X objective (see Materials Table), find the sample and area of interest. Capture the image to use as a map when imaging at high magnification.\nRemove the slide, making minimal adjustments to the slide stage. Change to the 60x oil immersion objective (see Materials Table), place a small drop of oil on the objective, and replace the slide (coverslip down) onto the slide stage.\nFind sample again. Set the laser power, exposure time, and binning to the desired levels for each channel.\n\tNOTE: We generally use laser power of 0.8, camera exposure time of 100 msec, and binning of 2 (see Materials Table for hardware and software specifications); optimal settings need to be empirically determined for each experiment.\n\t\nOnce optimal settings are determined, use the same settings for all tissue sections within the experiment. Use the intensity histogram to note the optimal intensity range for each channel (this information will be used for analysis).",
    "Generate a z stack using the acquisition function: select the appropriate laser channels, then choose the upper and lower limits of the z stack. Choose a z stack step size that is one-half the value of the optical slice thickness provided by the software. Click “run” to collect the images.\nUse Fiji16 or a comparable program for image analysis. Within Fiji, open the z stack file with Custom color mode option and the channels split into separate windows. Open the “Adjust Brightness/Contrast” tool from the Image pulldown menu; within each channel, set the optimal histogram intensity range determined in 4.5.1. Apply these channel ranges to all z stacks being analyzed.\nMerge the individual channels into a single composite image using Image->Color pulldown menu.\nCreate a flattened z stack from the composite image using the Image->Stacks->z project menu. This image will be significantly brighter than the 3D image; adjust the histogram intensity range for the control sample to avoid oversaturation, and apply the same settings to the experimental flattened z stack.\nTo generate a 3D image, first use the Image->Stacks->3D project menu 17. Choose either the x-axis or y-axis of rotation. Set the slice spacing as the same number of microns as the z stack step size. Choose the desired total rotation and set the rotation angle increment to 1. Then open the Image J 3D Viewer from the Plugins pulldown menu. Choose the composite image generated in 4.8, display as Volume, and set the Resampling factor to 1 or 2."
