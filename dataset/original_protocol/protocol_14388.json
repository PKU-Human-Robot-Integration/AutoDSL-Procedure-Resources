    "For this procedure, informed consent is required and has been obtained for every patient who has undergone surgery in the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. All examinations and surgical interventions were executed in accordance with national laws and the declaration of Helsinki from 1975 in its current version.\nNOTE: Unless indicated otherwise, instructions will always only refer to the side on which the procedure is being performed. Use sterilized equipment.\n1. Patient Preparation\nPerform a thorough ophthalmic examination (with special attention to eyelids, upper and lower punctum, and tear drainage) including irrigation and probing to test for PANDO10.\n\t\nFor standardized irrigation, insert a Bangerter probe into the upper and, subsequently, lower punctum. Begin by inserting it vertically, then tilt it toward the temple into a horizontal position to follow the physiological formation of the canaliculus. When the probe is in position, carefully inject saline to test for lacrimal duct obstruction.\n\t\tNOTE: In infrasaccal PANDO, the Bangerter cannula will easily reach the lateral nasal wall without a bouncy resistance (\"hard stop\"). Trying to irrigate will result in contralateral reflux through the opposite punctum without any fluid reaching the patient's pharynx10.\nRule out acute infections, tumors of the tear drainage system as well as traumatic, congenital or presaccal obstruction.\n\t\nTo rule out acute infections, look for painful reddening, swelling or purulent discharge of the tear drainage. To rule out tumors, look for indolent swelling, ulceration or pigmentation. Presaccal obstruction results in a bouncy resistance when trying to advance the Bangerter Probe into the lacrimal sac (\"soft stop\"). Congenital and traumatic obstruction can be ruled out by taking patient history10,19,20.\nRule out intranasal rhinological pathologies, e.g. severe septum deviation. This should be done by taking the patient's history in combination with a rhinological inspection of the nasal cavity 21.",
    "Put the patient under general anesthesia, e.g. by intravenous injection of propofol, remifentanil, and atracurium for induction and inhalation of desfluran plus intravenous remifentanil for maintenance, using standard weight-adapted dosing10. Intubation should be performed, but use of a larynx mask is also possible.\n\tNOTE: Anesthetics as well as dosages may vary between clinics. No specific anaesthesia protocol is required for laser-assisted DCR.\n2. Laser-assisted DCR\nInsert the video-assisted endoscope into the nasal cavity by carefully advancing it through the nostril. Visualize the anterior margin of the middle turbinate by slightly tilting the endoscope towards the lateral nasal wall.\nSet up the laser equipment and laser settings to the correct values. Put on protective glasses.\n\t\nConnect the laser fiber optic (diameter 400 µm) to the diode laser (wavelength 810 nm). Set the diode laser settings to 6 - 8 W, 200 ms pulse duration, 100 ms exposition pause.\nFit the laser fiber optic into the hand-piece for maneuvering and through a blunt cannula. Let 2 - 3 mm of the fiber stick out at the tip of the cannula.\nPerform carbonization of the laser fiber tip by holding it on a wooden spatula and applying laser energy for a few seconds until the tip is sufficiently blackened.\n\t\tNOTE: This will limit unwanted energy distribution to the tissue of the lacrimal sac.\nPosition the laser fiber correctly at the lateral nasal wall.\n\t\nUse a lacrimal probe to dilate the lower punctum (Figure 2a). Insert the probe in a vertical orientation at first and then bring into a horizontal orientation before further advancing it towards the lacrimal sac. This will allow for the laser fiber to be inserted smoothly in the next step.",
    "Insert the laser fiber into the lower canaliculus (Figure 2b, 2c). Begin by inserting it vertically, then tilt it toward the temple into a horizontal position to follow the physiological formation of the lower canaliculus.\nCarefully advance the laser fiber into the lacrimal sac until it touches the lateral nasal wall, i.e. the medial lacrimal saccal wall. There, aim the tip in an antero-inferior direction so that it points to the anterior margin of the middle turbinate.\nVerify correct positioning endoscopically by monitoring transluminescence of the aiming beam at the height of the anterior margin of the middle turbinate (Figure 2d).\nCreate a sufficient nasolacrimal bypass by application of pulsed laser energy to the nasal wall.\n\t\nApply laser energy (using the parameters set above), keeping constant contact to the wall without pressure, aiming for the anterior margin of the middle turbinate. The laser will vaporize the tissue directly in front of it, creating a nasolacrimal bypass (Figure 2d, 2e).\n\t\tNOTE: The total energy required ranges between 0.9 - 1.8 kJ and tends to vary between patients.\nEnsure that the fiber tip is not actively pressed against the wall. Be careful not to let the tip slip back into the metal cannula as this will cause thermal injury due to heating of the metal. Also avoid sideways movements as the tip can break off.\nUpon penetrating the lateral nasal wall, pull the laser fiber back a bit and enlarge the ostium by carefully vaporizing the margins in a circular manner. Try to create as large a bypass as possible (Figure 2f).\nAim for a total diameter of 5 mm for the ostium.\nStop applying energy and remove the laser fiber together with the hand-piece and the cannula by carefully retracting the equipment.",
    "Verify the patency of the ostium by saline irrigation using a Bangerter probe as described in 1.1.1. If a patent ostium was created, successful irrigation should be visible endoscopically.\nRemove the Bangerter probe.\nPlace the silicon tube (Figure 2g).\n\t\nThrough the lower punctum, insert a monocanalicular silicon tube and carefully advance it until the leading metal tip passes the bony ostium and protrudes into the nasal cavity.\nUse Blakesley forceps to grab the tip from inside the nasal cavity and pull the silicon tube out of the nose and into position (Figure 2h).\nUse a pair of scissors to shorten the silicon tube. The end should not be sticking out of the nose.\nPerform silicon intubation via the upper canaliculus as well (following steps 2.7.1 through 2.7.3) (Figure 2h).\nRemove the nasal endoscope.\n3. Post-op Care and Follow-up\nAfter surgery, initiate treatment with antibiotic eye drops (e.g. ofloxacin), decongestant eye drops (e.g. xylometazolin) and steroidal eye drops (e.g. prednisolone acetate). Antibiotics can be stopped after one week, while steroidal and decongestant eye drops should slowly be weaned off over the course of one month.\nFollow-up at six weeks and three months after surgery. Look for resolution of symptoms, silicon tube prolapse, infection, and secretion.\nRemove silicon tubes at three months after surgery by simply grabbing the T-shaped end at the height of the puncta and carefully pulling them out.\nSubscription Required.
