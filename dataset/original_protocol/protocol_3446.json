Then perform a long cut of the skull along the midline, a short cut at the naso-frontal suture (in front of the olfactory bulbs) and two short cuts along the parietal-interparietal sutures. By flipping the bone parts to the side, the brain is easily accessible. Place curved forceps underneath the entire brain, and thereby lift up the entire brain to remove it from the skull (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/333-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(I) Dissection of the cortex.\n(J) Dissected cortex which is used as starting material for preparation of single-cell suspension.\nRemove the hippocampus to avoid contamination from other cell types.\nDissect the cortex. Here we specifically focus on the isolation of cortical cell types. In our hands, careful and precise dissection of the area of interest is most efficient to avoid contamination from cell types originating from other brain areas (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nTransfer cortex to Papain-DNase solution in a 50 mL bioreactor tube harboring a filter-cap and incubate for 30 min at 37°C in a shaking water bath.\nDuring the incubation time, prepare lysis buffer and the respective collection tubes (PCR tubes) or 96-well plate.\nAfter 30 min, remove the bioreactor tube containing the dissociated cortical tissue from the water bath and add Solution 2. Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down to dissolve remaining tissue parts.\nCentrifuge for 5 min with 100 × g at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in Solution 2. Add DMEM/F12 as a wash buffer. Mix well.\nCentrifuge for 5 min with 200 × g at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 300 – 500 μL media. Single-cell suspension is now ready for FACS. Keep suspension on ice until sorting can be started.\nFor collection of a low number of cells, proceed with step 11. For sorting single cells, proceed with step 20.\nCritical: Perform all steps in a timely manner because cell death rate increases over time.\nCritical: Although volumes are rather small, ventilated cap bioreactor tubes (50 mL) were used during the whole procedure in order to allow high oxygen exposure.\nIsolation of cells with MADM-induced UPD using FACS (collection of low cell numbers)\nTiming: 45 min to 3 h",
    "In this section of the protocol MADM+ cells are sorted according to their fluorescent colors and collected for RNA-sequencing.\nEnsure that the cytometer (here: FACS Aria III) is set up for your sorting experiment.\nUse the 100 μm nozzle.\nSet the sample temperature and the temperature for the collection tubes to 4°C.\nFlush the system with RNase Away for 1–2 min.\nFlush the system with RNase-free water for 1–2 min.\nAdjust the side streams so that they hit the middle of the collection tubes.\nFilter your entire sample through a 40 μm cell strainer. Dilute your sample with 200–300 μL media, which is additionally added through the cell strainer.\nPrepare 0.2 mL PCR tubes containing 4 μL lysis buffer as collection tubes for your sorted cells.\nPlace the collection tubes into 1.5 mL tubes, which are then placed into the appropriate FACS Aria tube holder.\nLoad your sample and record 30,000 - 50,000 events. Adjust the gates to select the surviving cell population (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1), for removing doublets and for sorting GFP+ and TdT+ (optional: GFP+ TdT+ double positive) cells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 2).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/333-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Depending on your experimental needs, either set a maximum number of labeled cells that shall be collected or sort the entire volume of sample.",
    "Note: Lysis buffer was used and optimized for single cells and low amounts of cells (max. 400 cells). If a greater number of cells will be collected with FACS, a different lysis buffer needs to be used (Laukoter et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nOnce sorting is completed, transfer the entire volume of the collected sample into an empty well in a 96-well plate, which should remain on dry ice throughout the procedure. Be fast with pipetting since samples freeze in the pipette tip if this step is executed too slowly.\nCollect all replicates for your RNA-sequencing experiment in this 96-well plate. Either fill the entire plate on a single day, or add few samples on a day-to-day basis. When adding few samples over a time course of several days or weeks, store the plate at −80°C until further processing or additional samples can be added.\nNote: This setup with collecting samples on a 96-well plate proved to be very useful for preparing samples for RNA-sequencing. However, sample collection and handling can be adapted to individual use and respective purposes.\nNote: Since sorting can be done only for one sample at the time, it is important to decide on the number of cells you want to collect for your sequencing experiment. The longer a sample is kept on ice before it is processed by FACS, the higher the number of dead cells (this is of critical importance when cells from postnatal brains are sorted).\nIsolation of cells with MADM-induced UPD using FACS for single-cell RNA-sequencing\nTiming: 45 min to 1.5 h\nThis section of the protocol lists details on sorting MADM+ cells for single-cell RNA-sequencing.\nEnsure that the cytometer (here: FACS Aria III) is set up for your sorting experiment.\nUse the 100 μm nozzle.",
    "Set the sample temperature and the plate holder temperature to 4°C.\nFlush the system with RNase Away for 1–2 min.\nFlush the system with RNase-free water for 1–2 min.\nMake sure that the stream is hitting the wells of the 96-well plate properly in the middle (use “test sort” of unlabeled cells on the cover of the plate).\nFilter your entire sample through a 40 μm cell strainer. Dilute your sample with 200–300 μL media, which is additionally added through the cell strainer.\nPlace 96-well plate in the plate holder. All wells need to be filled with 4 μL lysis buffer.\nLoad your sample and record 30,000 – 50,000 events. Adjust the gates to select the live cell population (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1), for removing doublets and for sorting GFP+ and TdT+ (optional: GFP+ TdT+ double positive) cells (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) (same comments as above) (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 2).\nOpen the sort layout and set the purity to single cells.\nSelect the collection of a single cell per well.\nNote: Design a layout for collecting your single cells. Keep in mind that you may want to sort a higher number of cells (up to 400 cells) as a positive control for your sequencing experiment in one of the wells. For this purpose, you can also make use of the MADM-unlabeled cells as there is no limitation with cell numbers.\nConsult with your sequencing facility regarding the plate layout since empty wells and a positive control might be needed at specific positions. An example for a plate layout is provided in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_333_7.csv\nStart sorting.",
    "After sorting is completed, seal the plate with AluminaSeal, quick freeze immediately on dry ice and store at −80°C until further processing. In order to ensure maximum sequencing efficiency plates should be processed within three months after collection.\nPreparation of single-cell suspension for sorting astrocytes with MADM-induced UPD\nTiming: 1.5–3 h\nThis section of the protocol explains the dissection and preparation of single-cell suspension for sorting MADM+ astrocytes with MADM-induced UPD.\nCritical: There is no stopping point in the protocol after starting with dissection of the experimental animal until the end of sorting.\nPrepare all solutions required for the tissue dissociation (details are listed above)\nPapain-DNase solution\nSolution 2\nDMEM/F12\nMedia\nSubstrate Reagent of FACS Blue LacZ beta galactosidase detection kit\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_333_8.csv\nSacrifice experimental animal. Individual animals were used as biological replicates for downstream bioinformatics analyses upon RNA-seq.\nDecapitate the animal.\nRemove the skin overlaying the skull. Then perform a long cut of the skull along the midline, a short cut at the naso-frontal suture (in front of the olfactory bulbs) and two short cuts along the parietal-interparietal sutures. By flipping the bone parts to the side, the brain is easily accessible. Place curved forceps underneath the entire brain, and thereby lift up the entire brain to remove it from the skull (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRemove the hippocampus to avoid contamination from other cell types.\nDissect the cortex. In this protocol, we specifically focus on the isolation of cortical cell types. Thus, careful and precise dissection of the area of interest is most efficient to avoid contamination from cell types originating from other brain areas (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nTransfer cortex into Papain-DNase solution in a 1.5 mL tube and incubate for 30 min at 37°C in a Thermoshaker.",
    "Critical: Make sure to not close the lid completely. Some air should get into the tube to allow oxygenation.\nDuring the enzymatic digestion, prepare LacZ staining solution by diluting LacZ substrate 1:50 in DMEM/F12. Pre-activate the staining solution by incubating at 37°C until step 10.\nAlso prepare lysis buffer and the respective collection tubes (PCR tubes).\nAdd Solution 2 to the Tissue-Papain-DNase mix. Mix well by pipetting up and down and dissociate remaining pieces of tissue.\nCentrifuge for 8 min at 100 × g at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the pellet in Solution 2. Add DMEM/F12 as wash buffer.\nCentrifuge for 8 min at 200 × g at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 100 μL pre-activated LacZ staining solution.

Keep samples at 20°C–22°C and in the dark until sorting is started.\nNote: LacZ staining is temperature sensitive. Staining is most stable at RT.\nIsolation of astrocytes with MADM-induced UPD using FACS (collection of low cell numbers)\nTiming: 45 min to 3 h\nIn this section of the protocol, astrocytes are sorted according to MADM-labeling and LacZ substrate fluorescent signal, and are then collected for bulk RNA-sequencing.\nEnsure that the cytometer (here: FACS Aria III) is set up for your sorting experiment.\nUse the 100 μm nozzle.\nSet the sample temperature to 20°C–22°C and the temperature for the collection tubes to 4°C.\nFlush the system with RNase Away for 1–2 min.\nFlush the system with RNase-free water for 1–2 min.\nAdjust the side streams so that they hit the middle of the collection tubes.",
    "Filter your entire sample through a 40 μm cell strainer. Dilute your sample with 200 μL media, which is additionally added through the cell strainer.\nFirst load the LacZ negative, MADM positive sample and record 100,000 cells. Use the negative control to adjust the gates for the live cell population (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1) as well as for the MADM+ cells (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 2), and also adjust the LacZ gate (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5E).\nPrepare 0.2 mL PCR tubes containing 4 μL lysis buffer as collection tubes for your sorted cells.\nPlace the collection tubes into 1.5 mL tubes, which are then placed in the appropriate FACS Aria tube holder.\nLoad your LacZ positive sample and start sorting. Astrocytes are either GFP+ LacZ+ or TdT+ LacZ+ double positive. LacZ− but GFP+ and TdT+ cells are enriched for neurons of the Emx1+ lineage, but also contain oligodendrocytes and olfactory bulb neuroblasts. Either set a maximum number of labeled cells that shall be collected, or sort the entire volume of sample (max. 400 cells).\nOnce sorting is completed, transfer the entire volume of the collected sample into an empty well in a 96-well plate, which should remain on dry ice throughout the whole procedure.
