    "All animal procedures included in this protocol were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Kansas Medical Center, in compliance with all federal and state laws and regulations.\n1. Creation of knee OA in mice\nCreate a mouse model of knee OA by surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) as described by Glasson et al.18 in 22 wild-type BALB/c mice at 10-11 weeks of age. Perform sham surgery as a control procedure on eight mice with the same background and age.\n\tNOTE: Both sexes were used for the original project to meet the NIH requirement for consideration of sex as a biological variable, though examination of sex difference is not the scope of this protocol.\nAnesthetize animals by inhalation of Isoflurane. Check the depth of anesthesia by monitoring their respiratory rate/effort and lack of response to toe/tail pinch. Put animals in a supine position.\nShave the skin in the knee area and clean the skin with Povidone-Iodine + alcohol skin scrub; three alternating cycles.\nPerform the DMM procedure on the right knee under a surgical microscope. Expose the knee joint through a medial parapatellar incision (1.2-1.5 cm in length) and incise the joint capsule. Keep the patella and the patellar tendon intact. After careful exposure of the medial meniscotibial ligament (MML) which anchors the medial meniscus to the tibial plateau, transect it with micro-surgical scissors to destabilize the medial meniscus.\nPerform sham surgery on the right knee as a control procedure, in which the MML was visualized but not transected.\nClose the joint capsule with 8-0 absorbable polyglactin sutures and skin incision with 7-0 non-absorbable sutures for both DMM and sham procedures to assure proper use of the knee once healing has occurred.",
    "Inject SR Buprenorphine (0.20-0.5 mg/kg) subcutaneously (SC) immediately before the surgical procedure for analgesia, which provides pain relief up to 72 h after a single injection. Monitor operated animals after surgery.\nEuthanize animals using a CO2 chamber at 2, 8, and 16 weeks post-surgery. After unconsciousness, confirm the death of the animals by a physical method (opening the chest cavity). These methods of euthanasia are consistent with the recommendations of the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA).\nHarvest the knee joints for histological analyses at 2, 8, and 16 weeks after DMM surgery and at 2 and 16 weeks after Sham surgery to obtain mouse knee joints with different degrees of OA severity or SCB thickening.\n2. Preparation of tissue sections and histologic images\nFix mouse knee joint tissue samples in 2% paraformaldehyde, decalcify them in 25% formic acid, embed in paraffin, and section coronally to examine both the medial and lateral compartments.\nCut knee specimens from the posterior side of the knee using a microtome and collect tissue sections that are 5-µm-thick at 70-80 µm intervals to obtain about 40 tissue slides across the entire knee joint. A micrometer-assisted estimation suggests that slide numbers 1-6 are from the far-posterior, 11-18 from mid-posterior, 23-30 from mid-anterior, and 35-40 from the far-anterior portion of the knee joint. Discard or collect intervening sections for additional stains.\nPerform Safranin-O and fast green stains according to the manufacturer's instructions to specifically identify cartilage cells and matrices on every five slides. Perform Hematoxylin-Eosin staining according to the manufacturer's instructions to examine the knee joints at the cellular and tissue levels as described previously19,20,21,22.\nAcquire histologic images with a microscope equipped with a digital camera. General histopathologic analysis and histologic OA grading were conducted as described previously15,19,20,21,22.",
    "3. Quantitative measurement of osteoarthritic subchondral bone with ImageJ software\nDownload the ImageJ software and open histologic images of interest.\n\t\nDownload the ImageJ bundled with Java 1.8.0_172 from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/.\nOpen the ImageJ program. Click the File tab on the Ribbon and click the Open option to open the histologic image.\nFind the file directory address, select the picture file, and click Open.\nCalibrate ImageJ with the micrometer on the histologic images.\n\t\nUse the straight-line tool to sketch one unit of length on the micrometer and click Analyze > (then) Set scale. Set the Known distance and Pixel aspect ratio to 1 and click OK. ImageJ can convert the pixel length to the unit length on micrometer.\nSet the measured factor to area. Click Analyze > Set Measurement and check Area and Limit to threshold box under new window. This step sets ImageJ to measure the parameter \"Area\" within selected \"Threshold\".\nMeasure total subchondral bone (SCB) area of interest.\n\t\nDefine the SCB region of interest (ROI) as shown in the orange boxes of Figure 1A, which covers the SCB cortical plate and a portion of the underlying trabecular bone adjacent to the cortical plate in the medial femoral condyle (MFC) and medial tibial plateau (MTP) with specific dimensions for each ROI. Osteoarthritic SCB thickening usually occurs in these areas. Define the SCB ROI with the same shape and dimension in each MFC or MTP for all examined joints to ensure that the same size of the specific ROI was measured for all animals.\nSketch the outline of the total SCB area of interest by using the Polygon selection tool under the main window of ImageJ.\n\t\tNOTE: The selection tools give the system a threshold to limit the measured area.",
    "Measure the total SCB area: After the threshold is selected, click Analyze > Measure. A \"Results\" window with area measurement will open.\nMeasure the bone substance area containing solid bone without bone marrow.\n\t\nClick Edit > Clear Outside to exclude the area outside the total SCB area.\n\t\tNOTE: Only the total SCB area is visible after clicking Clear Outside option. The picture outside the total SCB area will turn black. This step allows observers to focus on the bone substance area within the area of interest.\nClick Image > Adjust > Color threshold to open the \"Threshold Color\" window. Click Original at the bottom of the \"Threshold Color\" window to restore the picture to the original status. Use selection tools in step 3.3.2 to draw a small box in the bone substance region. Click the Sample option at the bottom of the \"Threshold Color\" window to define the bone substance area.\n\t\tNOTE: The \"Sample\" option in the \"Threshold Color\" window allows ImageJ to select all the same pixels on the total SCB area as the bone substance sample area. The selected bone substance area will turn red.\nClick Select at the bottom of the threshold color balance window to create an area measurement threshold. Click Analyze > Measure at ImageJ main menu, and the bone substance area measurement result will show on the \"Results\" window.\nSave the data of the total SCB area and bone substance area.\nCalculate the ratio of bone substance area (mm2) to total SCB area (mm2) of interest which represents the bone substance thickness (mm2/1.0 mm2) within the total SCB area.",
    "Measure the SCB thickness of histologic sections/images (as described in steps 3.1-3.5) of far-posterior, mid-posterior, mid-anterior, and far-anterior areas (as described in step 2.2) of DMM-induced OA to assess area-specific SCB thickness of 6 knee joints (Figure 1B).\n\t​NOTE: This can validate the reliability of this quantitative measurement protocol because it is known that osteoarthritic SCB changes co-localize with cartilage lesions and that osteoarthritic cartilage damage with SCB thickening is more severe in the weight-bearing areas (mid-portion) of rodent knee joints14,15. Therefore, it is appropriate to use mid-sections for quantitative measurement of osteoarthritic SCB thickening.\n4. Statistics\nPerform statistical analyses using data from quantitative measurement and visual grading of SCB thickness. Determine the inter- and intra-observer variability and reproducibility by Pearson's correlation coefficient analyses.\nDetermine the significance of differences between study groups using Student's t-tests or one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc test (Tukey) using spreadsheet software. Consider a p-value of less than 0.05 to be statistically significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
