    "1. Rat Cardiomyocyte Cultures\nAll experiments were performed under protocols approved by the institutional animal care and use committee, IACUC.\nObtain rat cardiomyocytes from the hearts (ventricles) of male rats (240-260 g) using methods described previously4. Briefly, anesthetize animals using an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg; confirm anesthesia by toe pinch method) and then remove hearts into 10.0 ml, 1 mM Ca2+ containing Krebs Ringer buffer, pH 7.4.\nRinse the hearts 5-6x to remove blood and then switch to a Ca2+ free Krebs Ringer buffer containing 0.02% protease and 0.06% collagenase A (5.0 ml/heart). Incubate the hearts in this solution for 10-15 min at 37 °C with occasional shaking.\nAfter 10-15 min, wash out the enzymatic solution with Ca2+ free Krebs Ringer buffer for an additional 5 min. Release the cells from the flaccid tissue using a 25 ml pipette by pipetting the suspension up and down several times.\nSeparate the cells from tissue by filtering through a 70 μm nylon mesh and allow them to settle in Krebs Ringer buffer containing 0.1 mM Ca2+. Suspend the cell pellet in 1.0 ml Krebs Ringer buffer containing 0.2 mM Ca2+.\nCarefully layer over 5.0 ml 60 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, BSA, in 15 ml centrifuge tubes, to separate cardiomyocytes from nonmyocytes and allow them to settle for 30 min. The cardiomyocytes are heavier and move to the bottom of the tube. Remove carefully the supernatant cells and media. Repeat this step once to further purify the cells.",
    "Gradually transition by washing (in steps using 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, 0.75 mM, and 1.0 mM Ca2+ containing buffer) the ventricular myocytes/cardiomyocytes to 1.0 mM Ca2+ containing buffer and resuspended in ACCT medium consisting of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, DMEM containing 2 mg/ml BSA, 2 mM L-carnitine, 5 mM creatine, 5 mM taurine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.\nPlate the cardiomyocytes in ACCT medium at a density of 100 to 150 cells/mm2 on 100 mm or 35 mm laminin coated plastic culture dishes or 40 x 22 mm glass coverslips precoated with laminin (1 μg/cm2). After 1 hr, wash the dishes with 2.0 ml ACCT to remove cells that are not attached. Add 10.0 ml of fresh media and incubate the cells.\n2. Differentiated Air-liquid Interface (ALI) Culture of Human Airway Epithelial Basal Cells\nProcure human tracheobronchial tissues from National Disease Research Interchange under Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Cell harvest and perform culture using a published procedure5,6. This procedure uses cell cultures as they are a precise model for human inhalation exposures to TICs, however, if needed one can isolate and grow at ALI mouse and/or rat airway epithelial cells7,8.\nBriefly, make small pieces (~¼ inch) of the tissue after removing all connective tissue and lymph nodes. Wash tissue several times in Lactated Ringer solution. Add tissues to a 50 ml conical tube and add protease solution (1% Protease/0.01% DNase in minimal essential media, MEM, tissue to fluid ratio (1:10)).\nRock the tissue at 4 °C for overnight. End the dissociation of the tissue by adding 10% fetal bovine serum. Scrape the epithelial surface with a surgical scalpel and collect the cells by centrifugation (2,000 rpm for 10 min).",
    "Plate cells at passage one on collagen-coated snapwells in special ALI medium prepared as described in detail by Fulcher et al9. Culture for 5 days before changing to air-liquid interface (ALI) by removing apical media.\nFeed the cells using ALI media every alternate day and allow the cells to differentiate for additional 2-3 weeks (observe numerous beating cilia and mucus secretion) before performing exposures. Wash the apical surface with warm PBS along with media changes.\n3. Chlorine Exposure\nContain the chlorine exposure system (CES) inside a qualified chemical hood with an operational face velocity of 100 fpm that provides the necessary secondary containment to prevent exposure of personnel in the event of accidental chlorine leaks.\nOperate the system under slight positive pressure (0.5 inches of water). Dry air is fed at 15 L/min and an appropriate level of chlorine is fed to attain the desired final chlorine concentration. The chambers have a locking lid with 4 mini BCU locks and a low durometer silicone gasket to provide the pressure seal.\nDeliver the Cl2 mixture through a Mass Flow Controller. The CES uses a compressed gas cylinder containing 1.0% Cl2 in dry nitrogen.\nRegulate the dilution airflow using the custom designed control panel and similarly regulate the Cl2 concentration delivered to the exposure chambers. A low volume sampling pump pulls the exhaust from the chambers into a chlorine analyzer to monitor concentrations that are then recorded on a data logger connected to the analyzer.\nMeasure the flow rates within the chambers prior to exposure using a flow meter to assure equal delivery and exhaust rates.\nPrepare the cell cultures for exposure by removing the supernatant media and adding fresh media (basolateral media in ALI cultures). Any pretreatments with agents could be performed at this time.",
    "Expose the ALI cultures of airway epithelial cells to Cl2 gas (50, 100, or 300 ppm for 30 min) in the two sealed polysulfone biocontainment chambers. The cardiomyocytes (submerged or confluent cultures on membranes) are exposed to 50 or 100 ppm Cl2 for 15 min.\nAfter exposure flush the chambers with air until the Cl2 level falls below 1 ppm and can be safely opened to remove cells (within 5 min).\n4. Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TER) Measurement\nMeasure the TER of air-liquid-interface, ALI, cultures using an epithelial voltohmmeter with a pair of silver chloride “chopstick” electrodes.\nEquilibrate the chopstick electrode in the ALI media 15 min before use.\nAdd warm media to the apical (1.0 ml) and basolateral (2.0 ml) surface and measure the TER using the chopstick electrodes of the voltohmmeter.\nDip the shorter arm of the electrode in apical media and the longer arm in the basolateral media. Click the ‘measure’ button on the voltohmmeter to evaluate the electrical resistance.\nThe voltohmmeter has the option to measure ohms or k ohms. Subtract the resistance across a cell-free culture support from the resistance measured across each cell layer to yield the transepithelial resistance (TER).\n5. Caspase Measurement\nAdd fresh ALI media (2.0 ml) to the basolateral surface post exposure and incubate the cell at room temperature. Collect supernatant media at 4 and 24 hr.\nMeasure caspase 3/7 activity in the media supernatants by using a commercial caspase 3/7 assay kit.\n6. Western Blot and Immunocytochemistry\nPerform western blots using cell lysates as previously described10. Suspend the protein lysate (20 μg) in 5x reduced sample buffer and boil for 5 min. Subject the protein lysate to SDS-PAGE (4-15%) and transfer the separated proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane by electrophoretic blotting.",
    "Block non-specific binding by incubating the membrane with 5% milk in wash buffer (PBS + 0.1% detergent) and probe the membranes with primary antibodies against SERCA2 or sarcomeric actin at 1:1,000 dilution, overnight at 4 °C. Next, wash and incubate membranes with the respective peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and develop for detection as described before10 using commercial peroxidase detection kit.\nFor immunocytochemistry treat live cells grown on inserts or glass coverslips in 6-well plates with 0.4% Triton-X-100 in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer for 20 min after rinsing with PBS.\nBlock nonspecific binding by treating the cells with 5% donkey serum for 20 min, and then incubate the cells with non-specific IgG or individual primary antibodies specific to sarcomeric actin or Ki-67.\nWash the cells with PBS and incubate with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies to detect the primary antibody and a nuclear stain (1 μg/ml DAPI).\nWash with PBS and mount coverslips using commercial mounting media.\nVisualize the staining using a fluorescent microscope.\nSubscription Required.
