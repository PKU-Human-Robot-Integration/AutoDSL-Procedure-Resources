    "1. Preparation of Fungal Material\nGrowing Powdery Mildew\n\t\nGrow plants in growth chambers with the following conditions: 22 °C day temperature, 20 °C night temperature, 80% relative humidity, 14-h day-length and a light intensity of 125 µE/m2/s (provided by fluorescent lighting).\nInfect cucumber plants (Cucumis sativa variety Bush Champion) with Golovinomyces cichoracearum strain UCSC1 as described18,29.\nHarvesting Powdery Mildew Conidia\n\t\nHarvest conidia from infected plants at 7 - 10 days after inoculation using a small vacuum with an in-line filter (11 µm) on which the conidia accumulate. Applying gentle pressure, run the vacuum nozzle along the surface of the leaf to collect the conidia.\n\t\tNOTE: The average yield of G. cichoracearum is 20 mg of conidia from a heavily infected cucumber leaf of approximately 130 cm2 in area.\nBrush about 150 mg of the conidia (approximately 375 µL volume, or conidia from 7-8 infected cucumber leaves) from the filter onto a sheet of clean paper. From here, transfer conidia into 2 mL cryovials with two 5/32-inch diameter pre-chilled (in liquid nitrogen) steel milling balls. Immediately return tubes to liquid nitrogen. Store tubes at -80 °C.\nBreaking Open Conidia by Ball Milling\n\t\nFlash freeze aluminum plates of ball mill in liquid nitrogen. Load cryovials into ball-mill rack. Vigorously shake the cryovials with conidia and steel balls in the ball mill for 30 s at 30 cycles/s (at room temperature). Immediately refreeze cryovials in liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: Initially, access a sample of conidia by microscopy at 100X magnification for efficiency of cell wall rupture during grinding. If needed, grind for an additional 1 - 2 rounds of 30 s for 30 cycles/s, but keep the number of rounds to a minimum. Routine assessment of conidial breakage by microscopy at this stage is unnecessary once optimal conditions have been established.",
    "2. Genomic DNA Purification\nConidia Lysis\n\t\nWorking quickly to avoid thawing conidia, remove the steel balls from cryovials with a magnet. Add 700 µL 65 °C lysis buffer (Table 1) and vortex 5 - 10 s until a slurry is formed.\nAdd 300 µL pre-warmed (65 °C) 5% (v/v) sarcosyl and gently invert to mix (1 inversion per 3 s) five times. Incubate tubes for 30 min at 65 °C; invert gently 3 times at 10, 20 and 30 min. Using a wide-bore pipette tip, transfer entire solution to new 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. At all subsequent steps, mix by gentle, slow inversion and transfer the DNA-containing solutions with wide-bore pipette tips.\nDNA Extraction I\n\t\nAdd 1 volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) to the lysis solution and gently invert to mix five times. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature, gently inverting to mix five times at the halfway point and again at the end of the incubation. Centrifuge at room temperature for 15 min at 14,000 x g. Using wide-bore pipette tip, carefully transfer the aqueous layer to new 2 mL microcentrifuge tube; avoid including material from the interface.\nDNA Precipitation I\n\t\nAdd 1 volume room temperature 100% isopropanol (approximately 750 μL) and gently invert to mix six times. Centrifuge at room temperature for 15 min at 14,000 x g. Carefully remove the supernatant and discard.\nAdd 450 μL pre-chilled (-20 °C) 70% ethanol. Centrifuge for 5 min at room temperature at 14,000 x g. Carefully remove the supernatant and discard. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3 s, carefully remove the supernatant with fine pipette tip and discard. Air-dry the pellet for 15 min at room temperature. Do not dry for longer than 15 min.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 300 µL TE (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid, pH 8.0). Incubate overnight at 4 °C. Gently flick to resuspend any residual material that did not go into solution.\nTo remove RNA contamination, add 10 µL RNase A (10 mg/mL). Gently invert to mix three times. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3 s. Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h.\nDNA Extraction II\n\t\nAdd 300 µL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 v/v) and gently invert to mix five times. Incubate 10 min at room temperature, gently inverting to mix five times at the halfway mark and again at the end of the incubation. Centrifuge 15 min at room temperature at 14,000 x g. Using a wide-bore pipette tip, transfer the supernatant to new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nDNA Precipitation II\n\t\nAdd 0.01 volume 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 (approximately 3 µL), gently invert to mix five times. Add 2.5 volumes pre-chilled (-20 °C) 100% ethanol (approximately 750 μL). Gently invert to mix five times. Incubate overnight at -20° C.\nCentrifuge 30 min at 4 °C at 14,000 x g. Carefully remove the supernatant and discard.\nAdd 450 µL pre-chilled (-20 °C) 70% ethanol. Centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C at 14,000 x g. Carefully remove the supernatant and discard. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 3 s. Carefully remove the supernatant with fine pipette tip and discard.\nAir-dry the pellet for 30-60 min at room temperature. Resuspend the pellet in 27.5 µL TE. Incubate overnight at 4 °C. Gently flick to resuspend any residual material that did not go into solution.",
    "Aliquot 2.5 µL into 22.5 µL TE (final volume 25 μL) for quality control tests (see below). Store DNA samples at 4 °C until submission for sequencing. For long-term storage, store samples at -80 °C and minimize freeze-thaw cycles to prevent shearing.\n\t\tNOTE: Take care when pipetting at this step as the high molecular weight genomic DNA can be difficult to pipette properly, and it is important to ensure that \"QC Aliquot\" is an accurate representation of genomic DNA sample.\n3. Quality Control\nSample Purity\n\t\nUsing a TE blank, assess the sample purity of the DNA by loading 1 µL of the QC Aliquot on a small-volume spectrophotometer. Record A260/A280 and A260/A230 readings. Pure DNA will have an A260/A280 ratio of approximately 1.8 and A260/A230 ratio between 1.8 and 2.2.\nQuantification of Genomic DNA\n\t\nPerform quantification of QC aliquot using a commercial double-stranded DNA quantification assay kit according to the manufacturer instructions.\nDNA Quality Assessment I\n\t\nLoad approximately 60 ng genomic DNA and a DNA ladder on an 0.7% agarose gel in 1x TAE (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Run gel apparatus at 70 V for 40 - 45 min until genomic DNA bands are approximately 2 cm from the well and band separation in the ladder is apparent. These conditions may need to be adjusted based on available gel electrophoresis apparatus.\nDNA Quality Assessment II\n\t\nLoad approximately 60 ng genomic DNA and a high molecular weight DNA ladder (suitable for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5x TBE (44.5 mM Tris, 44.5 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) and run in 0.5x TBE running buffer using a 5 - 80 kbp waveform pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocol for 16 h.\nAssessment of Bacterial, Fungal, and Plant Contaminants",
    "Perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the appropriate internal transcribed spacers (ITS) regions of the ribosomal genes using primers and amplification conditions listed in Table 2. Load 10 µL of the resultant reaction on a gel.\n\t\tNOTE: A band representing the powdery mildew ITS region should be amplified with the fungal ITS primers. DNA from this amplicon and any amplicon generated with the bacterial, or plant primers should be sequenced to determine the origin of the contamination. Only powdery mildew ITS sequences should be found in the fungal amplicon.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
