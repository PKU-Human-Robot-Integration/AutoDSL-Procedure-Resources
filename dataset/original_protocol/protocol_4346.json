    "Analysis of proliferation after TGFβ stimulation (long-term effect) Note: Each condition should be measured in technical triplicates. For keratinocytes one well of a 6 well plate is sufficient for FACS analysis but depending on the cell type, the assay can be performed with higher or lower amounts of cells. Proliferation is measured by uptake of the nucleotide analogue 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) during cell cycle S-Phase and then detected by Click-iT chemistry. 5-brom-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake can be used alternatively.    Plate cell line of interest in complete medium in such a density, so that wells will reach a confluency of 70% the next day (1.2 x 105 cells/well for keratinocytes). For keratinocytes wells should be coated with coating medium for 30 min at 37 °C which should be removed before plating the cells).    The next day medium is removed and (without any washing step) is replaced with cell culture medium (should be room temperature) supplemented with reduced serum concentration (here 5% FBS) and 0, 5 or 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 and continue culture under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2).    After 6 h add 10 µM EdU per well without changing the medium and continue to culture cells under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2).    Further incubate the cells for 8 h and then generate single cell suspension by trypsin digestion. For trypsin digestion remove the medium and wash cells once with PBS. Then add trypsin solution, incubate cells at standard condition (37 °C, 5% CO2) and as soon as cells have detached collect cells by adding complete medium. After spinning down the cells (5 min at 900 rpm, 78 x g) wash single cell suspension once with PBS before following Click-iT assay kit protocol.  Note: The isolation time point can vary between cell types.",
    "It is recommended to determine in a pre-experiment a time point, where approximately 70% of the untreated cells of interest are EdU positive.   Click-iT protocol (mainly follows manufacturers protocol which can be downloaded on the Invitrogen web site).   Wash cells once with 1% BSA-PBS solution at room temperature. Note: Cell washes and buffer changes are performed by centrifugation of cell suspensions for 2 min at 2,100 rpm (380 x g), removal of the supernatant and gentle resuspension of the cells in the respective new buffer.   Fix cells with 200 µl 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS (Component D in the kit) for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilize by buffer change to 200 µl 1x Click-iT saponin-based permeabilization solution (Component E in the kit) and incubate for 15 min.   Prepare Click-iT staining solution according manufacturer protocol using PBS (see Click-iT reaction cocktail table) and incubate cells with this solution for 30 min in the dark at room temperature.   Wash cells once with 500 µl Click-iT permeabilization and washing buffer, resuspend cells in 200 µl of the same buffer and immediately proceed to FACS measurement.   To detect Alexa Fluor 488 for EdU labeling, use 488 nm excitation with a green emission filter 530/30 nm or similar (FL1 channel).   Use unstained cells as negative control.   Determine percentage of EdU positive cells, identifying all cells which have been in cell cycle S-phase during EdU incorporation (=proliferating cells).        pSmad detection after TGFβ stimulation (short-term effect, or eminent effects) Note: Phosphorylation of Smad proteins is an immediate effect after TGFβ receptor activation of the canonical TGFβ signaling cascade and will occur in all cell types. Conversely the subsequent TGFβ downstream signaling can be highly diverse between different cell types.   Plate for each condition one 10 cm dish.",
    "Cell of interest density should be chosen so that 10 cm dishes will reach a confluency of 70% the next day (for keratinocytes 2 x 106 cells/dish). For keratinocytes dishes should be coated with coating medium for 30 min at 37 °C which should be removed before plating the cells.   The next day serum-starve the cells for several hours (2-4 h) in starving medium (e.g. Starving KGM) under standard cell culture conditions.   Then add 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 to the starving medium and isolate cells after 0, 30, 60 and 120 min continued incubation at standard cell culture conditions.    For cell isolation, wash cells once with PBS and lyse them in appropriate volume of lysis buffer (e.g. RIPA, for keratinocytes 120 µl per 10 cm dish) directly on the plate on ice. Collect cell lysates with a cell scraper and pipette up and down 5 times with a 200 µl tip for complete cell lysis. Then spin down cell lysates at full speed (10 min, 14,000 rpm, 16,800 x g) at 4 °C and isolate the supernatant (sample to run on SDS-page).    Separate samples on a 10% SDS-PAGE using standard Western blot protocol considering that Smad2 migrates around 55-60 kDa. A lane with pre-stained protein standard (e.g. precision plus protein kaleidoscope standards) should be included (for keratinocytes, 20 µg of protein per lane was ideal.) After gel separation, samples were transferred onto a PVDF membrane, using over-night tank transfer and Dunn buffer. Recipes for 2x Laemmli sample buffer, standard SDS-PAGE running buffer, Dunn Carbonate buffer are included in the recipes section.",
    "For the detection of murine pSmad2 and total Smad2/3 the following antibodies and conditions were used:   pSmad2:    Block membrane for 1 h at room temperature with 5% milk TBS-T and incubate pSmad2 antibody 1:1,000 in 1% milk TBS-T over night at 4 °C.    Wash membranes 3x 15 min with TBS-T and incubate with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.    Wash membranes 3x 15 min with TBS-T before detection.     Total Smad2/3:    Block membrane for 1 h at room temperature with 5% BSA TBS-T and incubate total Smad2/3 antibody 1:1,000 in 1% BSA TBS-T over night at 4 °C.    Wash membranes 3x 15 min and incubate with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.    Wash membranes 3x 15 min before detection.  Note: It is recommended to detect first pSmad2 and after membrane stripping to blot for total Smad2/3. For membrane stripping incubate membrane for 10 min in pre-heated (50 °C) stripping buffer at 50 °C. Then wash the membrane with ddH2O (4x 5 min) before reactivating the membrane with 2-propanol. Repeat the washing of the membranes (4x 5 min) before blocking."
