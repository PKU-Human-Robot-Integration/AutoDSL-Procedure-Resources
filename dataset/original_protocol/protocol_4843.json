    "Housing and all animal procedures used were according to the European Union policy (Directive 86/609/EEC) and institutionally approved protocols. E0.5: day of the vaginal plug.Pregnant mice of recipient and donor genotypes are sacrificed with cervical dislocation at the same day of gestation. Embryos at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) are easier to handle.Embryos are removed from their yolk sacs and their brain is dissected under a dissecting microscope in Leibovitz’s L-15/penicillin-streptomycin medium using Dumont #5 forceps (Video 1).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Brain dissection from a mouse E14.5 embryo. The video illustrates step by step instructions for the dissection of the brain from a mouse embryo at the embryonic stage E14.5.                                                      Cortices and OBs are separated from the midbrain (Video 1). An illustration of the cortices and OBs as well as the site of the transplant is shown in Figure 1. We add 2 ml of pre-warmed 3% SeaPlaque agarose in Leibovitz’s/L-15 (60 °C) per well of a 24-well plate placed on ice. Each sample is transferred with a perforated spoon as shown in Figure 2A.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160824/20160824194445_5867.jpgFigure 1. Illustration showing a top and side view of the forebrain from a mouse E14.5 embryo. The area of transplantation is indicated in red.Swirl the liquid using a 200 μl pipette tip to prevent the sample from touching the bottom of the well (Figure 2B). It is preferable that you set the orientation of your sample in the agarose with the tip before it solidifies, after approximately 10-15 min. In our case the olfactory bulbs are facing up in a vertical position.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160824/20160824194545_3816.jpgFigure 2. Embedding of a tissue in 3% SeaPlaque agarose in Leibovitz’s L-15 on ice. A. A dissected brain is transferred with a perforated spoon in a well with 3% SeaPlaque agarose in Leibovitz’s L-15.",
    "The 24-well plate with the agarose has previously been put on ice. B. Swirl the liquid using a 200 μl pipette tip. Without disrupting the tissue, orient it with the tip on a vertical position. Swirl for approximately 10 min until the agarose starts solidifying.Fill the tank of the vibratome with ice-cold 1x PBS with penicillin-streptomycin. Use a new UV-sterilized vibratome blade.Remove the agarose block containing the tissue from the plastic well using a micro spatula.Cut the agarose block with a steel blade in order to create a trapezoid with the tissue placed horizontally in its center (Figure 3A).Use instant glue and fix the tissue block to the metallic specimen plate of the vibratome with the big base of the trapezoid facing down.Adapt the specimen plate in the vibratome and set the speed to 5, the frequency to 5 and the feed to 250 μm.Perform continuous cutting and transfer the sections that contain the olfactory bulb to a 60 mm culture dish containing 2 ml of Leibovitz’s L-15/penicillin-streptomycin medium, using a perforated spoon (Figure 3B).Put the cell culture insert with the correct orientation in a new 60 mm culture dish containing 2.2 ml of DMEM/F12 plus medium. On the top surface of the membrane add 100 μl of DMEM/F12 plus medium in spots as shown in Figure 3C.Remove the surrounding agarose from the tissue sections using the dissecting forceps and transfer them on top of the cell culture insert membrane with a sterile disposable transfer pipette (Figure 3D). Use separate membranes for the recipient and the donor sections.Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 h.Take the dish out of the incubator and remove 2 ml of the medium from the plate, using a 5 ml sterile disposable pipette.",
    "Afterwards, add 2 ml of prewarmed (at 37 °C) Neurobasal/B27 plus medium to the plate. The sections on top of the membrane remain wet during the whole procedure, and their medium will be gradually replaced with the new one through the membrane pores that are in contact with it. Under the dissecting microscope cut a small triangular piece of the OB in the recipient section using the straight triangle insert pin (adapted to the Pin Holder) and remove it from the section with a 200 μl pipette.Cut a slightly bigger piece of the donor OB section and transfer it with a 200 μl pipette (transplant in medium) close to the recipient section (Figure 3E).Push the transplant (Red* in Figure 3E) towards the missing part of the recipient and adjust it using a minutien pin (adapted to the pin holder) (Figure 3F).Incubate the transplanted sections (Figure 3F) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24, 48 or 72 h. Change medium every 24 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160824/20160824202457_5381.jpgFigure 3. Transplantation procedure in steps. A. A trapezoid is prepared with the tissue placed horizontally in its center. B. Sagittal section containing the forebrain. C. A cell culture insert is applied in a 60 mm culture dish containing 2.2 ml of DMEM/F12 plus medium. Add in spots 100 μl of DMEM/F12 plus medium. D. A brain section, clean of agarose, on the top surface of the cell culture insert. E. The proximal-to-the-cortex part of dorsal OB has been removed from the recipient slice and a slightly larger piece from the same site of the donor is transferred close to the recipient (red asterisk). F. The transplant has been applied to the recipient slice with the correct orientation. Scale: 1 mm in D, E, F.",
    "For further sectioning fix the tissue section with 4% PFA for 1 h at RT, wash in 1x PBS and transfer it to the bottom of a clean well in a 24-well plate. Dry the section and re-embed it in 3% of SeaPlaque agarose as described before (the section now should stay at the bottom of the well).Re-section the tissue in a similar way to the one described before in the vibratome at a 50 μm thickness.Continue with immunostaining as described in Bastakis et al. (2015)."
