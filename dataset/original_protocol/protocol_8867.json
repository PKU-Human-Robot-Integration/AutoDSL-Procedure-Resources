    "Surgical and animal procedures are carried out strictly according to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experiments involving the use of animals are approved by UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Plasmid Cloning, Expression and Purification of Mono-biotinylated BDNF (mBtBDNF)\nNOTE: Construct pre-proBDNFavi and BirA cDNA into pcDNA3.1 vector and coexpress in HEK293FT cells10. Purify mBtBDNF using Ni-NTA beads according to previously published method of producing mature and biologically active monobiotinylated nerve growth factor (mBtNGF)10.\n2. Preparation of Microfluidic Chambers\nMicrofluidic neuron culturing device makes it possible to fluidically isolate axons from neuron cell bodies. Assemble chambers with freshly coated coverslips right before each dissection. Microfluidic chambers used in this protocol are commercially purchased (see materials and equipment’s table). Handwash and reused commercially purchased chambers up to 5-6x.\nHand wash microfluidic chambers in 1% Alconox. Rinse three times with Milli-Q water for 30 min each. Hand wash chambers again in 70% ethanol.\nLay out chambers to dry on Parafilm in the laminar flow hood. Radiate and sterilize both sides of the chambers for 20 min under UV. Store sterilized chambers in a sterile 15 cm dish sealed with Parafilm at room temperature.\nPlace 24 x 40 mm No. 1 glass coverslips in a glass container. Soak the coverslips in 35% hydrochloride acid overnight on a rotator. On the following day, rinse the coverslips three times for 30 min each with water.\nSterilize the coverslips one by one by dipping each coverslip into 100% ethanol and flaming over a Bunsen burner. Store dry coverslips in a sterile petri dish and keep it at room temperature until coating.",
    "Lay out the coverslips in a 15 cm culture dish. Coat each coverslip with 0.7 ml of 0.01% poly-L-Lysine (PLL) and incubate in the hood at room temperature.\nAfter 1 hr, rinse the coverslips three times with sterile water. Dry coverslips with vacuum and place each coverslip into a 6 cm culture dish.\nTo assemble the microfluidic chamber, place the chamber with microgroove side at the bottom onto the PLL coated coverslip with caution not to touch the microgrooves. Gently pressed down the chamber with a pipette tip to ensure the chamber was tightly sealed.\n3. Dissection of Neuronal Culture and Plate on Chambers\nPlace two E17-E18 rat hippocampi (one brain) dissected in a 15 ml conical tube containing 2 ml dissection buffer (HBSS, no calcium, no magnesium, with 1% pen/strep and 10 mM HEPES. Rinse the tissues 3x with 5 ml dissection buffer each time. Remove the dissection buffer as much as possible and add 900 μl of fresh dissection buffer.\nTo digest the tissue, add 100 μl of 10x trypsin (2.5%) into the dissection buffer to make 1x working concentration. Place the conical tube in a 37 °C water bath. After 10 min of digestion, add 100 μl of 10 mg/ml DNase I to a final concentration around 1 mg/ml.\nUsing a fire-polished Pasteur glass pipette, gently triturate the tissues by pipetting up and down 5-10x. Right after trituration, quench the trypsin with 2 ml plating medium (Neurobasal with 10% FBS, 2 mM GlutaMax, 2% B27).",
    "Leave the sample in the hood for 5 min to allow any debris of the tissues to settle down to the bottom. Carefully remove 2 ml of supernatant into a clean sterile 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min to pellet the cells. Resuspend the pellet in 50 μl plating media\nCount the cells with hemocytometer. Load 15-20 μl cell suspension (~40,000 cells) into one compartment of the microfluidic chamber. Place the chamber in the incubator for 10 min to allow the cells to attach to the coverslip. After 10 min, add more plating media to fill up both compartments of the chamber.\nOn the second day of dissection, completely replace the plating media with maintenance media (Neurobasal with 2 mM GlutaMax, 2% B27) in both the cell body and the axon compartment. Axons from the hippocampal neurons start to cross the microgrooves in day 3 and reach the axon compartment between day 5-7. During this period of time, replace half of the culturing media with fresh maintenance media every 24~48 hr.\n4. Axonal Transport of QD-BDNF\nPrior to live imaging of QD-BDNF axonal transport, deplete BDNF from both the cell body and axon compartments of the microfluidic chamber by thoroughly rinse both compartments with BDNF-free, serum free Neurobasal media every 30 min for 2 hr.\nDuring BDNF depletion, prepare the QD-BDNF conjugates. Mix 50 nM of mono-biotinylated BDNF dimer with 50 nM QD655-streptavidin conjugates in neurobasal media and incubate on ice for 60 min.",
    "Remove media in the axon compartment and add 300 μl QD-BDNF with a final concentration of 0.25 nM for 4 hr at 37 °C. To minimize the diffusing of QD-BDNF into the cell body compartment, it is very important to always maintain a higher level of media in the cell body compartment than in the axon compartment. Wash off unbound QD-BDNF after incubation before live imaging.\nCarry out live imaging of QD-BDNF transport using an inverted microscope equipped with a 100X oil objective lens. Warm up the scope and the environmental chamber attached to it to a constant temperature (37 °C) and CO2 (5%). Use a set of Texas red excitation/emission cubes to visualize the QD655 signal.\nAcquire and capture time-lapse images within the middle axons at the speed of 1 frame/sec for a total of 2 min using a CCD camera. Use microgrooves with no axons that have no QD and hence no signal as a control for infiltration.\nAnalyze BDNF transport using any image analysis software or NIH ImageJ.\nSubscription Required.
