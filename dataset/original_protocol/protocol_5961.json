Fill the large BeadBeater chamber with 1/3rd zirconium/silica beads.Transfer the bacterial pellet into the BeadBeater chamber using a spatula.Note: It is important to minimize headspace in the chamber so vortexing to resuspend is not recommended as it will cause foaming. Wash the bottle with 50 ml of resuspension buffer and decant into the BeadBeater chamber.Fill the chamber with resuspension buffer to minimize headspace while leaving enough room for the BeadBeater rotor.Fill the cooling chamber with ice water and let chill for 5 min.Beat 4 cycles at 2.5 min each with at least 5-10 min cooling in between cycles.Allow the beads to settle and carefully pipet the lysate into as many 50 ml Oak Ridge tubes as necessary.Add 50 ml of resuspension buffer to the beads and pulse for 10 s to wash the beads.Combine the wash with the lysate in the Oak Ridge tubes.Centrifuge at 30,000 x g, 4 °C for 45 min to pellet cell membrane material.Note: The pellet can be frozen for long-term storage at -80 °C.",
    "Thoroughly resuspend and combine the membrane pellets in 60-75 ml total resuspension buffer and pour into a clean 250 ml baffled flask.Note: The membrane pellet is hard to resuspend, so a combination of scraping with a spatula/pipette and vortex is necessary. Wash centrifuge tubes with 50 ml of 1-butanol total and decant into in the same flask.Cover tightly to prevent butanol evaporation and incubate with shaking at 37 °C for 45 min.Split the suspension into 50 ml Oak Ridge tubes.Note: The same tubes as Steps 19-20 can be used without cleaning.

Greater ice surface area will hasten drying. Freeze-dry overnight or to completion.Suspend in 5 ml of equilibration buffer.Split into 3 x 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes.Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris.Combine the supernatant and filter through a 0.45 μm PES syringe filter to remove any residual debris.Wash the filter with 500 μl of equilibration buffer and combine the filtrate.Draw the solution into a clean 5 ml syringe and proceed with column chromatography.Notes:Ensure that the final sample is completely free of debris. Otherwise, centrifuge and/or filter again to clarify. Ensure that there are no air bubbles. Tap the syringe to dislodge any air bubbles and let it stand upright for several minutes to allow air bubbles to rise.

    "7 ppm and assign NMR signals corresponding to S. aureus WTA and LTA as exemplified in Figure 3. See Notes about NMR standard.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181030/20181030190220_8906.jpgFigure 3. Sample 1H NMR spectra of WTA and LTA. A. WTA was liberated from peptidoglycan of wild-type S. aureus by NaOH hydrolysis causing loss of D-ala modifications. This WTA spectrum was obtained using the ZG pulse sequence without water suppression. B. LTA purified from wild-type S. aureus has very low levels of GlcNAc glycosylation but is highly D-alanylated. This LTA spectrum was obtained using the ZGPR pulse sequence with water suppression. These NMR spectra are adapted from published figures in Kho and Meredith (2018). Rbo = Ribitol; Gro = Glycerol.Dephosphorylation and monomerization of TA for ESI-MSNote: Hydrofluoric acid is extremely hazardous. Users should consult standard operating procedures and their safety office prior to use. Work in the chemical fume hood and take all necessary precautions. Weigh out 1 mg of purified TA in a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube. Suspend the LTA in 100 μl of 48% hydrofluoric acid.Incubate at room temperature for 20 h.Note: Insert the microcentrifuge tube into a clearly labeled 50 ml centrifuge tube as a secondary container to prevent accidental contact. Set-up a closed vessel drying apparatus with a filtered airstream (see Figure 2).Pass the air through a KOH trap and insert the outlet tubing into a saturated sodium carbonate solution.Note: Other saturated base solutions can be used. Insert the microcentrifuge tube into the closed vessel and evaporate it until there is no residual liquid using a low-velocity airstream.Resuspend the dried sample in 200 μl of 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate.Adjust to pH 7 with dilute ammonium hydroxide.Freeze in a dry ice bath or at -80 °C.Freeze-dry overnight or to completion.Store at -20 °C.",
    "Note: Depending on the side chain modifications, the HF incubation time should be adjusted to maximize TA monomerization while minimizing cleavage of side chains.  Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)Note: Perform the mass spectrometry analysis on a Waters Q-TOF Premier quadrupole/time of flight mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation [Micromass, Ltd.], Manchester, UK) operated using MassLynx software version 4.1 (Waters). Analyze the samples using direct injection analysis using a mobile phase consisting of 50% acetonitrile (LC-MS grade) and 50% aqueous 10 mM ammonium acetate with a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min.Set the nitrogen drying temperature to 300 °C at a flow of 7 L/min with a capillary voltage of 2.8 kV.Set the mass spectrometer to scan from 100 to 1,000 m/z in positive- and negative-ion modes using ESI.Assign calculated masses corresponding to S. aureus LTA as exemplified in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181030/20181030190241_2121.jpgFigure 4.
