    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing cells for imaging\nTiming: 2 days\nCoating coverslips with poly-D-lysine Coating the coverslips promotes cell adhesion and ensures that the cells are intact (not washed off) during the subsequent washing steps with imaging buffer.\nPre-warm cell culture media, DPBS, trypsin, poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/mL) by placing in a water bath set to 37°C.\nUsing tweezers gently place pre-autoclaved 15 mm No1 coverslips in each well of a 12-well cell culture plate.\nCoat the coverslips by adding 0.1–0.2 mL poly-D-lysine/well of the 12-well plate to sufficiently cover the coverslips in each well.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature (25°C) in the laminar flow cabinet.\nRemove poly-D-lysine and rinse the wells 3 times with DPBS.\nLeave the plates uncovered for at least 1 h in the laminar flow cabinet for drying.\nSeeding cells for imaging\nSeed 0.5 × 106 cells in each well of a 12-well plate with poly-D-lysine coated coverslip (prepared in the previous step) in 1 mL cell culture media.\nLeave the plates in an incubator for 48 h.\nDetecting calcium signals using TIRF microscopy\nTiming: 5 h\nLoading cells with Cal-520-AM (Ca2+ indicator), ci-IP3-PM (cell permeable caged IP3 analog), and EGTA-AM (cell permeable Ca2+ chelator).\nAfter 48 h, view the cells under a microscope using brightfield illumination and ensure that the cells have adhered and attained flattened morphology.\nPrepare 5 μM Cal-520-AM and 1 μM ci-IP3-PM by dissolving 5μL 1 mM Cal-520-AM and 1 μL 1 mM ci-IP3-PM in 1 mL imaging buffer supplemented with 1% BSA.\nPrepare 5 μM EGTA-AM by dissolving 5 μL 10 mM EGTA in 10 mL imaging buffer.\nUsing fine-tip forceps, transfer the cells on coverslip from step (a) into a 35-mm dish in the laminar flow cabinet.",
    "Wash the coverslip gently three times with 750 μL imaging buffer.\nDiscard the imaging buffer and incubate the coverslip in 750 μL Cal-520-AM and ci-IP3-PM supplemented imaging buffer (prepared in step b).\nIncubate at 25°C for an hour. Following 1 h incubation, rinse the coverslip gently with imaging buffer three times.\nDiscard the imaging buffer and gently add 750 μL of EGTA-AM supplemented imaging buffer (prepared in step c).\nIncubate at 25°C for 45 min. Following 45 min incubation, rinse the coverslip gently with imaging buffer three times.\nDiscard the imaging buffer. Add 750 μL fresh imaging buffer and incubate at 25°C for another 45 min to facilitate complete de-esterification of the loaded reagents.\nCritical: All the incubations steps are at room temperature (25°C) to avoid indicator sequestration into organelles and in the dark to prevent photo-degradation of the loaded indicator. Do not freeze/re-use the diluted Cal-520-AM/ci-IP3-PM mixture.\nImaging Ca2+ puffs using TIRF microscopy\nUsing fine forceps, attach the coverslip to a Warner perfusion chamber using vacuum grease. For each experimental set, image at least 5 coverslips.\nAdd 1 mL imaging buffer to the perfusion chamber to ensure that the cells are properly immersed.\nClean the bottom of the cover slip using a kimwipe to avoid artifacts while focusing/imaging.\nOn an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with PlanApo 60x/1.45 Oil TIRFM Microscope Objective, place a drop of low autofluorescence immersion oil.\nNext, fasten the Warner perfusion chamber on to the microscope stage.\nWe use Olympus CellSens Dimensions 2.3 (Build 189987) software for imaging (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/741-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/741-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Parameters that can be adjusted in the cellSens Dimension imaging software to acquire Ca2+ puffs\n(A) Camera control window allows acquiring movies/snapshots, adjusting the exposure time (gain), resolution, and field of view/region of interest for recording Ca2+ puffs.\n(B) The laser/LED control tab permits selection of appropriate laser and laser intensity to illuminate the dye loaded cells.\n(C) Adjust display facilitates optimizing the appearance of dye loaded cells.\n(D) Experiment manager window enables creating, saving, and executing a protocol for image acquisition. In this window, a series of commands including the laser type, exposure time, controlling UV laser shutters, and recording time for running an experiment can be defined.\n(E) A protocol used for acquiring a three second baseline (prior to photolysis), delivering UV flash from a 405 nm laser for 1 s (photolysis of ci-IP3), followed by recording Ca2+ puffs for 40 s using the 488 nm laser is presented.\n(F) The angle of incidence of laser to achieve total internal reflection can be optimized by adjusting the angle offset in the TIRF adjustment window. The penetration depth which varies with incident angle and other fixed parameters such as refractive indexes of glass, sample, numerical aperture, critical angle, maximal angle is displayed in this tab.\nExcite Cal-520 indicator using a 488 nm laser (set the intensity to a minimum such that the indicator fluorescence does not photobleach; see solution in “problems 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]”); ensure that the cells are in focus and in the incident angle of the laser achieves TIRF (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, 3C, and 3E). Fluorescence in TIRF mode characteristically reveals the interface between the plasma membrane and the coverslip (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). See solution in “problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]” if this does not occur.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/741-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(A) A hR1 endo cell illustrating the sites at which puffs were observed upon uncaging ci-IP3. Scale bar: 10 μm.\n(B) Traces showing the changes in fluorescence from the depicted regions of interest (1 μm by 1 μm) in A.\n(C) Time course of a Ca2+ puff is shown on an expanded time scale.\n(D) Gaussian blurred images of a representative Ca2+ puff over the entire duration of the puff obtained from a region of a cell. Scale bar: 2 μm.\nSet the protocol in the software to record baseline (during which the cells are quiescent) for at least 3/5 s; deliver a UV-flash using a 405 nm laser uniformly to uncage ci-IP3 for 1 s (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3D; see solution in “problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9]”). Alternatively, the UV laser light may be focused to a spot to illuminate a region of a cell.\nFollowing uncaging, record the Ca2+ puffs for a user-defined time period (for example 1 min or until the calcium signals globalize).\nCapture the emitted fluorescence using a Hamamatsu ORCA-fusion CMOS digital camera C14440. Images were acquired from a final field of (86.7 × 86.7 μm) 400 × 400 pixels (one pixel=216 nm), penetration depth of ∼140 nm at a rate of ∼97 frames/s (binning 2 × 2), and at an exposure of 10 msec (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: All the necessary precautions must be considered before operating the lasers. Lasers can cause irreparable damage to the eye and skin burns. Although the Olympus TIRF condenser employs a laser interrupt when laser light is directed to the eyepieces it is recommended that appropriate goggles to protect eyes and long-sleeve gloves to protect skin from laser burns are worn.",
    "Critical: Ensure that the lights are off during the entire process of imaging. Set the 488 nm laser intensity to a minimum to avoid photobleaching/spontaneous puff activity. The optimum laser intensity for imaging can be confirmed by using HEK-293 cells which lack all the 3 endogenous IP3Rs (HEK-3KO). It is also critical to optimize the intensity of the UV flash (typically in the range of 0.1–2 mW) and duration (100 ms–1000 ms) for uncaging ci-IP3-PM. The speed of recording can be enhanced by increasing the binning to 4 × 4. Following dye loading, cells appear healthy and can be used for acquiring images for at least ∼45 min. Each coverslip can be used to acquire multiple recordings since the focused UV-laser used to uncage ci-IP3 triggers uncaging in the field of view and only a small fraction of cells on the coverslips are exposed to laser light. Nevertheless, avoid recording puffs from the same field of view more than once.\nAlternatives: Cells can also be superfused with a Gαq-coupled agonist using a perfusion system to elevate intracellular levels of IP3 to evoke Ca2+ puffs (Emrich et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Lock et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Cal-590-AM indicator can be used in place of Cal-520-AM which differ in their excitation/emission wavelengths (558/584 nm and 492/514 nm for Cal-590 and Cal-520, respectively) and also their affinities for Ca2+ (kd=561 nM and 320 nM for Cal-590 and Cal-520, respectively). The long excitation/emission wavelength of Cal-590 makes it compatible for use with multicolor detection, for example, with GFP tagged proteins (Thillaiappan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "Note: The parameters mentioned in parenthesis as examples work best for hR1 endo cells and with our microscope settings, however, these parameters vary based on the cell types/speed of recording/number of puffs/frequency of puffs/duration of puff/radius of puffs and other factors. Hence, they need to be optimized accordingly. All the puffs identified automatically by the algorithm were manually confirmed before analysis.
