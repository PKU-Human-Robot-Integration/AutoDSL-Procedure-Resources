    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol we present here has been developed for isolation of blastoderm cells from annual killifish embryos and it is specifically optimized for A. nigripinnis and N. furzeri, that have a similar hard and resistant chorion.\nFabrication of bursting chambers\nTiming: 6 h 20 min\nThe procedure presented here requires bursting of the eggs in what, hereafter, we will call “bursting chambers”. These chambers are small (8 mm in diameter and approx. 5 mm in height), sterile, made of inert silicone (PDMS, polydimethylsiloxane) passivated with antifouling agent (pluronic acid). Bursting chambers are composed of two layers of PDMS (i.e., bottom layer and wells) which are fabricated using commonly available equipment (i.e., scale, vacuum chamber, oven, UV lamp, tweezers). For each device, 4 chambers are obtained (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2770-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Specifics of the device for embryo bursting (bursting chambers)\nSchematics show two different views of the device and report the details of its structure and dimensions. These chambers facilitate the collection of the material extracted from the egg during the dechorionation procedure.\nNote: embryo is in a confined environment, thus facilitating its manipulation.\nNote: after bursting, embryonic material is dispersed in a small volume and, thus, it can be easily collected.\nNote: hydrophobic profile of PDMS and pluronic acid passivation provide an antifouling environment that prevents cell adhesion to the chamber.\nPrepare petri dishes with a thin layer of PDMS that will serve as the bottom layer of the bursting chambers.\nAdd 1.5 g of base and 0.1 g of crosslinker in a petri dish of 35 mm diameter.\nCarefully mix PDMS at a 15:1 ratio by stirring with a plastic disposable pipette (e.g., p1000 pipette tip or dropper pipette)",
    "Critical: mix carefully for at least 3 min. Make sure to stir all the mixture including that at the corners. The mixture will turn from transparent to milky white due to incorporation of air bubbles.\nPrepare a thick slab of PDMS used to fabricate the wellś layer of the bursting chambers.\nAdd 15 g of base and 1 g of crosslinker directly in a petri dish of 100 mm diameter.\nCarefully mix PDMS at a 15:1 ratio by stirring with a plastic disposable pipette (e.g., p1000 pipette tip or dropper pipette).\nCritical: mix carefully for at least 5 min. Make sure to stir all the mixture including that at the corners. The mixture will turn from transparent to milky white due to incorporation of air bubbles.\nPlace both PDMS containing dishes (prepared in step 1 and 2) in a vacuum chamber and apply a strong negative pressure (below 500 mmHg) for at least 5 min.\nNote: this step is needed to degas the mixture and eliminate bubbles formed during the previous mixing process.\nNote: alternatively, if vacuum chamber and negative pressure pump are not present, PDMS mixtures can be left for 30 min to allow gas bubbles to come to the surface. Thereafter, bubbles can be broken by strong mechanical action, e.g., firm knocking of the bottom of the petri against a table.\nTransfer the PDMS dishes in the oven and cure the PDMS mixture for 1 h at 80°C on a plane surface.\nNote: this step is to form a solid layer inside the petri dish as the PDMS will crosslink.\nNote: alternatively, if an oven is not present, PDMS mixtures can be cured overnight at room temperature.\nCut the thick layer of PDMS to form the wells for the bursting chambers.",
    "Remove the thick layer of PDMS (prepared in step 2) from the petri dish using a round-tip tweezer and place it on the lid of the same petri dish.\nDetach the PDMS from the dish by passing the tip of the tweezer along the border and then pulling it out.\nCut its edges of the slab of PDMS using a bistoury.\nPunch 4 through holes of 8 mm diameter using an appropriate biopsy punch to form the wells of the bursting chamber.\nCritical: work in clean conditions and avoid getting dust and dirt on the PDSM to ensure good bonding in steps 6. Use clean tweezers to manipulate the PDMS. Bare hands would leave a layer of skin oil and gloves may leave powder on the PDMS surface.\nNote: ideally an octagon with 4 equidistant through holes should result. Make sure the size of the octagon fits the 35 mm plate.\nMount the PDMS slab with the wells onto the thin PDMS layer in the dish (prepared in step 1).\nGently press the slab against the surface of the dish using the tweezers to ensure adhesion and squeeze out air bubbles in between the two layers.\nLeave the device in the oven at 80°C for 3 h to improve bonding.\nNote: as both slabs are made of PDSM at a ratio of 15:1, which is below the recommended 10:1 (saturating crosslinking ratio), the slabs are relatively soft and retain some adhesive properties. Thus, they should sufficiently adhere to each other. However, we recommend using a protocol for PDMS / PDMS bonding if a plasma cleaner is available (a detailed protocol can be found in17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nFill the chambers with 50 μL each of Pluronic acid solution (S2) and incubate for 2 h at room temperature.",
    "Note: pluronic acid will form an antifouling coating on the PDSM which prevents protein adsorption and inhibits cell adhesion.\nNote: pluronic acid may leak underneath the chambers if the PDMS layers did not adhere properly (see step 6). This may occur if PDMS surfaces have been contaminated with dust or organic lipids from e.g., the operator’s hands. In which case we suggest revising step 6 and ensuring clean working conditions.\nWash chambers 4 times using dH2O by adding 50 μL of Milli-Q H2O and removing it using a p200 pipette.\nLet them dry and sterilize under UV light for 15 min before use.\nNote: in our experience, the UV light of the biosafety cabinet would be sufficient. Do not use 70% ethanol as it may deteriorate the pluronic coating.\nNote: we do not recommend reusing the device as after each use antifouling properties may deteriorate, and risk of contamination may increase.\nSpecies specific pretreatments\nTiming: N. furzeri: 50 min, A. nigripinnis: 15 min\nAnnual killifish eggs from different species have different chorion structures. Thus, different types of pretreatments are necessary to obtain a clean and sterile cell extract. The procedure below is only required for the specific species.\nHair removal for N. furzeri\nTiming: 50 min\nThe surface of N. furzeriś eggs is characterized by a coating of hairs to improve adherence to the substrate where the eggs are laid. Here, we present a procedure to enzymatically remove those hairs from the surface of the chorion. If hairs are not removed, they appear as contaminants in final cellś extract.\nCritical: all solutions and ambient temperature should be at 25°C ± 2°C.\nCritical: removal of the supernatants should be done carefully to avoid damaging or accidentally discarding the eggs. Best is to leave a small amount of solution on the eggs.",
    "Use a plastic Pasteur pipette to gently place the eggs (one-by-one) inside a glass tube for a maximum of 5 eggs per tube.\nCritical: glass tubes are required as, after pronase treatment eggs tend to adhere to the walls of plastic Eppendorf tubes and can break when extracting them from the tubes.\nAdd at least 200 μL of modified Yamamoto solution (S3) and let the eggs incubate for 10 min, after which the solution must be removed. This washing step should be repeated 3 times.\nRemove modified Yamamoto solution (S3) from the tube and add 200 μL of salt-tris buffer (S4) and incubate for 5 min.\nRemove the salt-tris buffer (S4) from the tube and add 200 μL of pronase solution (S5) and incubate for 40 min at 25°C.\nCritical: if 40 min are not enough for hair digestion, incubate for another 30 minutes (maximum). Frequently, inspect the eggs using a stereoscope to confirm hair removal.\nRemove pronase solution (S5) and wash the eggs 3 times using DMEM/F-12 media (S6) with EGTA.\nNote: swelling of the perivitelline space can be expected.\nNote: although we have not performed a systematic analysis of viability, the embryos after enzymatic hair removal look viable, and could potentially remain viable over time in E3/embryo medium if enzymatic treatment is washed out properly.\nCritical: when visualized under the stereoscope, eggs should look clean with a smooth surface (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). If their appearance is different, eggs should be discarded as longer pronase treatment can ultimately damage the embryo.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2770-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Result of the cleaning process of annual killifish eggs collected from the substrate\nTop row illustrates the comparison of the surface of the chorion of N. furzeri eggs before and after the hair removal.",
    "(A) the surface of N. furzeri eggs is covered with hairs (arrows).\n(B) a hairless egg after pronase treatment is shown and the different components of the egg are indicated. Bottom row illustrates the aspect of A. nigripinnis eggs before and after the cleaning from soil residues and sterilization with chlorine solution.\n(C) the chorion of the egg laid in soil is covered with visible impurities (arrows).\n(D) a clean egg without the presence of sediments is shown and the different components of the egg are indicated. Images were taken using a Leica S6 D stereo microscope at a 4× magnification. Scale bar = 500 μm.\nDebris cleaning for A. nigripinnis\nTiming: 15 min\nA. nigripinniś eggs are laid in mud, thus their chorion is typically covered in soil and microorganisms. The following steps are needed to ensure proper removal of soil residue and elimination of contaminants, such as bacteria.\nCritical: all solutions and ambient temperature should be at 25°C ± 2°C.\nCritical: removal of the supernatants should be done carefully to avoid damaging or accidentally discarding the eggs. Best is to leave a small amount of solution on the eggs.\nRemove soil from the embryo surface mechanically.\nUse a plastic Pasteur pipette to gently place one egg on a dry clean wipe.\nUse a paintbrush dipped in DMEM/F-12 media (S6) to carefully move and rotate the egg. Brushing and rotation are aimed at removing as much soil residue as possible.\nOnce clean, use a plastic Pasteur pipette to collect the egg and place it in a 15 mL falcon tube with 1 mL DMEM/F-12 media (S6) and repeat for all the eggs.",
    "Critical: if the egg deflates or breaks during this process the chorion was damaged before and it should be discarded as it would not survive the next steps.\nNote: to ensure proper cleaning this process should be performed for at least 2 min and at least 1 mL media should be used to brush off the soil. While the eggs can resist long dehydration times, we don’t recommend exceeding 10 minutes of dry condition in order to avoid triggering undesired signaling cascades (e.g., Annual killifish may enter diapause).\nPlace around 10–15 eggs in a 15 mL falcon tube, remove the DMEM/F-12 media (S6) and add 5 mL of chlorine solution (S8) for 5 min to disinfect the eggs.\nCritical: higher concentrations or longer incubation times may damage the embryo and reduce cellular viability.\nRemove the chlorine solution (S8) and wash the eggs 3 times using DMEM/F-12 media with EGTA (S7).\nCritical: eggs should look relatively smooth under a stereoscope (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). If their appearance is different, eggs should be discarded.\nRemoval of the chorion\nTiming: 1 h and 10 min per embryo\nOpening and removal of the chorion is arguably the most critical step of this protocol because of the chorion’s rheological properties, small perivitelline space, and the high hydrostatic pressure it holds. Example videos (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]) and images of the critical steps (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) are provided.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2770-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Critical steps in the dechorionation process of annual killifish eggs",
    "(A and B) Images in A and B depict the aspect at different steps of one N. furzeri and one A. nigripinnis egg, respectively. For both: eggs placed inside a bursting chamber (plating) are punctured using a pair of fine-pointed tweezers (puncturing). The eggs are grabbed and gently punctured using the tip to partly release the high pressure (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). After partial deflation of the egg and enlargement of the perivitelline space, the chorion is carefully peeled off using the tweezers from the opposite side of the puncture until detaching all the chorion from the egg (peeling – Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). The chorion is broken into pieces and discarded. The resulting dechorionated embryo is shown in the panel Dechor. Embryo. Images and suppl. Movies were taken using a Leica S6 D stereo microscope at a 4× magnification. Scale bar = 500 μm.\nNote: Mishandling of the steps below may cause the embryo to burst uncontrollably, which in turn may lead to loss of cells due to dispersion and cell death due to high shear forces.\nCritical: all solutions and ambient temperature should be set at 25°C ± 2°C.\nPlace one egg in the bursting chamber and add 50 μL of DMEM/F-12 media with EGTA (S7) and place the bursting chamber under a stereoscope chamber for high precision manipulation of the egg (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], Plating).\nNote: bursting chamber must be filled to the brim, but not overfilled to avoid formation of a convex meniscus that may affect proper visualization of the egg under the stereoscope. On the other hand, a concave meniscus can displace the egg to the bottom corners of the bursting chamber.",
    "CRITICAL STEP: Chorion puncturing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], Puncturing and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Two high precision tweezers with a very fine tip need to be used simultaneously in this step.\nGently but firmly hold the egg using the tweezer in the non-dominant hand.\nUse the tip of the other tweezer to gently puncture the chorion and release the internal pressure.\nCritical: a gentle touch with the tip of the tweezer is sufficient to puncture the chorion. If too much pressure is applied, the embryo will burst out causing cell dispersal and cell death.\nCritical: the embryo tends to adhere to the tweezers. Care must be taken not to accidentally remove the egg from the chamber.\nNote: a small amount of the eggś content will be released (red arrows in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Eventually, flow of fluid due to high pressure will move the EVL toward the puncture and obstruct the hole.\nCRITICAL STEP: opening and peeling of the chorion (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], peeling and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nGently grab the chorion with both tweezers on the opposite side of the puncture and pull the chorion apart to create a small opening (approximately ¼ of the diameter of the embryo).\nNote: while grabbing the chorion, part of the embryo’s contents will protrude through the opening made when puncturing and a small amount of the yolk content may be released. Be sure to not let the chorion membrane cut into the embryo, releasing the tweezers if the bending of the chorion produces extensive deformation of the embryo.\nUsing the tweezers, gently grab opposite sides of the small opening made in step 20a and pull the whole chorion apart to release the embryo (blue arrows in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "In the process, the chorion will break into small pieces which can be removed from the chamber to leave only the dechorionated embryo in the chamber.\nNote: be sure to not let the chorion membrane cut into the embryo, releasing the tweezers if the bending of the chorion produces extensive deformation of the embryo.\nCRITICAL STEP: collection of the dechorionated embryo). Remove the content of the bursting chamber using a p200 micropipette and place it in a sterile Eppendorf 1.5 mL tube.\nCritical: approximately 5 mm of the tip of the p200 micropipette must be cut to allow the passage of large objects and to reduce the sheer force during pipetting.\nNote: in our experience the dechorionated embryo does not adhere to the pipette tip.\nWash twice the well with additional 50 μL DMEM/F-12 media with EGTA (S7) to collect all the embryonic material in the chamber. Place all the media collected in the same Eppendorf tube.\nRepeat the protocol for all the embryos and pool the extracts together to a maximum of five dechorionated embryos per Eppendorf tube.\nCritical: in our experience, 5 embryos per tube represents the optimal number that allows the formation of a visible pellet after centrifugation. Collecting more embryos per tube results in accumulation of an excessive amount of material from the yolk that is consequently spun down with the cells.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1.

    "Critical: all solutions and ambient temperature should be at 25 ± 2°C.\nGently mix the DMEM/F-12 media with EGTA (S7) containing the dechorionated embryos using a p200 pipette set to 50 μL to separate the lipid droplets in the yolk from the rest of the embryo.\nCritical: it is mandatory to use DMEM/F-12 media with EGTA (S7) in this step to dissociate Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesions and separate aggregates into single cells.\nCritical: a sufficient shear stress should be applied to separate the lipid droplets from the yolk. However, excessive flow may cause cell damage. In our experience, slow pipetting for approximately 10 times using an intact p200 pipette tip should yield the desired outcome, which is achieved when droplets of lipids floating on top media can be seen.\nUse a cell culture centrifuge to pellet the blastoderm cells. Place the Eppendorf tubes in the centrifuge and spin at 200 × g for 5 min.\nNote: in case of problems with cell viability, centrifugation can be done using lower centrifugal forces for longer time, e.g., 100 × g for 15 min.\nDiscard the supernatant using a p200 pipette by making sure not to disturb the pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nCritical: removal of the supernatants should be done carefully to avoid removal of the isolated cells.\nNote: a small pellet should be visible. For this reason, it is important to centrifuge together the extract of at least 3 embryos.\nNote: ideally, the supernatant should be removed from the air-liquid interface to remove the lipids and other light components of the yolk.\nAdd 300 μL of DMEM/F-12 media (S6) and gently resuspend the solution using a p200 pipette. Repeat centrifugation and resuspension DMEM/F-12 media (S6) to remove undesired embryonic residues and reintroduce physiological levels of Ca2+.",
    "Critical: as more impurities and materials are removed during the washes, the pellet may become less apparent. Hence, even more care should be taken when removing the supernatant.\nAfter the last centrifugation, resuspend the pellet in 100 μL of DMEM/F-12 media (S6) using a P200 pipette. The cells can be used for the experiment.\nNote: while cells are viable for at least 6 h, experiments should be conducted as soon as this step is finished as, in general, it can be expected that embryonic cells may genetically and phenotypically drift when outside their physiological environment.\nAssessment of cell viability and cell isolation yield\nTiming: 30 min\nCount of viable cells can be measured by Calcein-AM assay. This assay serves the double scope of simultaneously assessing the ability of cells to de-esterify and retain the dye. As result, only viable cells with functional metabolic activity (de-esterase activity) and intact cell membrane are visible in green fluorescence and can be counted using standard cell counting methods (Neubauer chamber).\nCritical: all solutions and ambient temperature should be at 25°C ± 2°C.\nCritical: Higher concentrations of Calcein-AM dye have been tested up to 10 μM in DMEM/F-12 media (S6) showing staining without affecting cell viability, but fluorescence is observable already at 2 μM\nCentrifuge the cell suspension obtained in step 28 of previous session at 200 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant using a p200 pipette.\nCritical: removal of the supernatants should be done carefully to avoid removal of the isolated cells.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 μL DMEM/F-12 media containing Calcein AM (S9). Incubate for 20 min at 25°C.",
    "Note: longer incubation times may result in accumulation of dye inside cell organelles. In case staining is not clearly visible, it is best to increase the concentration to a maximum of 5 μM rather than increase the incubation time.\nAfter 20 min, pipette 10 μL of cell solution into a Neubauer chamber with a glass cover on top.\nNote: the solution will enter by capillarity between the chamber and the cover glass, thus distributing the cells within grid of the counting chamber (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, left).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2770-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Yield of A. nigripinnis blastoderm cells (deep embryonic and EVL cells) extracted at early post epiboly stages\n(A) Quantification of cell viability after extraction using the Neubauer chamber. Live cells appear green as they retain Calcein-AM fluorophore. Large cells are EVL cells and small are deep cells.\n(B) Exemplary images of a quadrant of the Neubauer chamber (left) and enlarged view (right) illustrate how to recognize EVL and deep cells and how to distinguish between live cells (those that retain Calcein-AM – green arrows) and dead cells (without fluorescence – red arrow). Images were acquired using a Nikon Ti2 eclipse inverted microscope with a 10× air objective with 0.30 NA. Scale bar: 100 μm.\n(C) Comparison of cell size allows distinguishing EVL (diameter above 10 μm) from deep cells (about 5 μm in diameter). Live cells also typically display cellular activities such as presence of cellular extrusion. Images were acquired using a Nikon Ti2 eclipse inverted microscope with a 40× air objective with 0.95 NA. Scale bar: 20 μm.\nNote: if the cover glass was properly placed the entire counting surface will be filled.",
    "Using a fluorescence microscope, count the number of cells with green fluorescence in each quadrant (typically 4 quadrants are used for counting) and calculate the average cell number per quadrant (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nNote: by counting the number of non-fluorescence cells the ratio between viable and non-viable cells can be obtained (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). This may be needed to understand whether the operator needs to be more careful when handling of embryo and/or cells (e.g. cells may be damaged by excessive mechanical manipulation or when exposed to the wrong temperatures).\nThe total number of cells per embryo is calculated by the following formulas:\nAverage number of counted cells / Volume of each quadrant (0.1 μL) = Number cells / μL.\nNumber of cell / μL ∗ total volume (10 μL) = total number of cells.\nTotal number of cells / number of embryos (5) = number of cells per embryo.\nNote: The number in brackets are those to use if following this procedure where we used all the material isolated to accurately count the cells. For routine check of cell viability and yield we suggest using a fraction of the cell suspension obtained in step 28 of previous session. Obviously, the calculations should take this into account."
