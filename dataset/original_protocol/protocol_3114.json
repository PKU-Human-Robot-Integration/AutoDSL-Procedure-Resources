    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAvertin (Tribromoethanol) 2.5% preparation\nAvertin is used for the sedation and anesthetization of dams during the milking process. While isoflurane inhalational anesthetic and sedation can be used, we have found the rapid clearance required either repeated dosing or continuous administration to the dam. These requirements were prohibitively cumbersome as it required ventilation hoods for safe administration and added additional instrumentation (cone masks and associated tubing) to the dam which was difficult to maintain during milk expression.·100% Avertin stock: dissolve 10 g of 2,2,2-tribromoethyl alcohol (Aldrich T4,840-2) with 10 mL of tert-amyl alcohol (Aldrich 24,048-6) stirring at 50°C until completely dissolved. Avertin 2.5% working solution: Dilute to 2.5% in water or isotonic saline, followed by filtration through 0.2-micron filter. (Store in dark at 4°C for up to 60 days.)\nCritical: Exposure of avertin to light can cause its decomposition, producing dibromoacetic aldehyde and hydrobromic acid2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] which may increase likelihood of skin irritation or post-injection peritoneal inflammation and fibrin serositis in abdominal organs.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] We minimize this risk by storing stock and working dilution for no more than 60 days covered in aluminum foil. We also limit Avertin exposures to no more than 2 injections per dam per litter, spaced >24 h apart.\nAdministration of intraperitoneal anesthetic and oxytocin\nTiming: 10 min\nHouse pups with identical genotype lactating dam during separation if desired to use pups in future or have additional milk expression from same dam in subsequent day.\nUsing a 22 gauge needle and 10mL syringe, administer Avertin 2.5% intraperitoneally at 0.015 mg/kg of dam body weight and monitor for effect. Induction of anesthesia was typically observed by 5 min.",
    "Using a 22 gauge needle and 10mL syringe, after anesthesia is induced, administer oxytocin intraperitoneally at 0.05 mg/kg of dam body weight and immediately move to pump milk.\nNote: The use of oxytocin is needed to provide milk let down in the dam. Onset of action will occur within 2 minutes of intraperitoneal injection and last for approximately 10 minutes.\nExpression of milk\nTiming: 10 min\nWith non-dominant hand, hold the anesthetized dam by the scruff of the neck between thumb and first finger and the tail between the fourth and fifth finger to arm the dam and expose the milk lines.\nStarting on massage phase at a strength of 3 on Spectra S2 breast pump, introduce the collecting tube to the nipple closest to the head.\nThere will be a 30 s lag time between initiation of pumping at nipple and expression of milk. This may require repositioning to have full extension of the nipple into the collecting tube with suction phase of the Spectra S2 pump.\nFollowing initial milk expression, transition Spectra S2 pump to expression phase on strength 3-5. This will crease longer suction cycles to increase milk flow.\nFollowing first expression of milk, the majority of the milk flow will occur in the first 2–3 min at a single nipple. Once milk flow decreases substantially, move to the next nipple.\nBe cautious to hold the Eppendorf tube upright during pumping and maneuver the collecting tube only to angle the dam and nipple. This will prevent backflow of expressed milk into the connecting tube.\nRepeat expression with subsequent nipples moving caudally, cautious to hold the Eppendorf tube upright to prevent backflow of milk into the connecting tube.",
    "After 10 min, the effects of oxytocin effect will wear off and no further milk will be collected. Return dam to pups and perform serial checks at 1, 2, and 4 h to ensure dam comes out of anesthesia without complications.\nTo maximize available milk, disconnect the collecting tube and Eppendorf tube from pump and connecting tube. A 1mL syringe is used to gently blow remaining milk in collecting tube into Eppendorf tube.\nOptional: Milk expression may best be done during first attempts using a one operator to hold the mouse and another to hold the Eppendorf and collecting tubes to prevent milk backflow."
