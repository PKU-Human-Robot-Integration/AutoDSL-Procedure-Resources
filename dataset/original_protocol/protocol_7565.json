    "Transcardial perfusion Note: A detailed protocol on transcardial perfusion including images and further methodological considerations can be found in Wu et al. (2021). The transcardial perfusion should take place in a chemical fume hood.Prepare solutions (PB and 4% PFA), pour into glass beakers, and connect to pump. Prefill tubing with respective solutions and remove air bubbles. Switching between solutions (step A15) can be aided by using a three-way stop cock connected to PB, 4% PFA, and the injection needle.Weigh the animal.Deeply anesthetize the animal via intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (250 mg/kg body weight).Position the mouse in a supine position on a dissection tray and secure the limbs with clamps or laboratory tape.Locate the most caudal end of the sternum indicating the caudal end of the rib cage.Make a midline incision into the abdominal cavity through the skin and muscle layers just caudal of the rib cage.Open thorax cavity by cutting through the diaphragm, taking care not to damage the heart.Cut along the lateral wall on either side of the rib cage and lift it to expose the heart.Locate the left ventricle and right atrium. The right atrium has a characteristic dark red color. The left ventricle forms the tip of the heart.Insert a 25-gauge needle into the caudal portion of the left ventricle at a flat angle, being careful not to puncture the septum.Make a small incision in the right atrium with scissors so that rapid blood flow occurs.Turn on the pump to flush ice-cold 0.1 PB into the left ventricle at a flow rate of 1–2 mL/min and keep the needle in place using modeling clay or laboratory tape. The blood should be washed out through the right atrium.",
    "Continue to flush with PB until the mouse’s body weight has been flushed three times and the liquid leaving the right atrium is clear and free of blood (e.g., if the animal’s weight is 10 g, inject a total volume of 30 mL of PB). Examine the liver; it should change color from dark red to pale yellow or white.Inject fixative (4% PFA) using a three-way stop cock, making sure that the needle stays in place. Double-check tubing to make sure there are no air bubbles present. Organs and muscles should start to turn stiff after a few minutes.Allow the fixative to run until at least three times the mouse’s body weight has been injected (e.g., if the animal’s weight is 10 g, inject a total volume of 30 mL of fixative). Liver, limbs, and tail should then be stiff.Stop the pump and remove the needle.Decapitate the animal with surgical scissors.Carefully remove the brain from the skull, taking care not to touch the area of interest (e.g., cochlear nucleus or MNTB). Cut larger nerves with fine scissors instead of tearing them to minimize damage to the brain.Using forceps, carefully remove the meninges from the ventral surface of the brainstem.Immerse brain in 4% PFA in a 12-well plate at 4 °C overnight. The volume of PFA solution used should be at least three times the volume of the brain (e.g., > 1.5 mL for an adult mouse brain). Make sure the whole brain is fully submerged in the solution.After 12 h of post fixation, discard PFA and replace it with PB. The volume of PB solution used should be at least three times the volume of the brain (e.g., > 1.5 mL for an adult mouse brain). Make sure the whole brain is fully submerged in the solution.",
    "Keep the brain immersed in PB at 4 °C until further use. For best results, use the brain within a few hours after being placed in PB. Storing the brain in PB for several days might reduce fluorescence and impact imaging quality.Slicing of fixed brain and mounting of brain slices Remove the brain from PB and excise the rostral half of the cerebrum with razor blades.Using super glue, adhere the brain on the cut surface to the specimen holder. Handle the brain with caution to avoid touching the brainstem.Immerse the brain into PB and orient the specimen holder so that the ventral surface of the brainstem faces the vibrating microtome blade.Using the microtome, slice the brain at a thickness of 40 μm, moving the blade at a rate of 20–50 μm/s.Identify the region of interest and collect the slices containing this region in PB solution.Mount the slices on microscope slides and remove any excess PB. Allow the slices to dry almost completely; then, add one drop of Aqua-Poly/Mount to each slice, taking care to avoid the formation of air bubbles. Cover the slice with a cover glass.Allow Aqua-Poly/Mount to harden for 24 h at room temperature. Store completed samples at 4 °C in the dark when not in use. Properly prepared samples can be stored for several months and imaged multiple times.Confocal imaging of presynaptic terminals Locate the MNTB region containing EGFP-labeled calyx terminals using a low-magnification objective. Select calyx terminals that are well separated from neighboring terminals for subsequent reconstruction.Switch to a 63× oil immersion objective lens (Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 Oil DIC M27) and select an imaging area that contains multiple well-separated calyx terminals.Image the membrane-bound EGFP expressed in the cells using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 518 nm.",
    "Select the Scan Mode Frame and set the image size to 1,024 × 1,024 pixels.Set Speed to 8 and Averaging to 4 lines. Set bit depth to 16 bit and the scan mode to bidirectional.Set the pixel size to 0.1 μm × 0.1 μm × 0.35 μm.Optimize the microscopy image by adjusting the laser power, gain, and offset. Images suitable for 3D reconstruction will have low background noise, high contrast, and are not saturated (Figure 1). The fluorescence signal should be within the range of the detector. Use the range indicator to adjust laser power and gain. If saturated areas are detected, lower laser power and gain until there are no saturated pixels in the image.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230828/20230828202638_1098.jpgFigure 1. Adjusting laser power and signal gain to improve confocal images. When acquiring confocal images, the fluorescence signal should be within the range of the detector. (A) Signal too weak, structural details are lost due to low laser power and signal gain. (B) When laser power and signal gain are adjusted, structural details become visible and calyceal terminals can be imaged. (C) Setting laser power and signal gain too high will result in saturation of image details and loss of structural details. Images were obtained using a 63× oil immersion objective.Set the imaging depth in z-axis so that the whole presynaptic terminal and at least 5 μm on either end are within the imaging volume.3D reconstruction of presynaptic terminals Start Imaris, select Arena, and drag and drop the image file containing the acquired z-stack into Arena. Double-click on the file to convert it to IMS format.Double-click to open the IMS file.Inspect the image volume in 3D View and locate a well-isolated calyx terminal that is fully captured within the image volume.",
    "Select Edit > Crop 3D and crop image volume to contain the selected calyx terminal. Make sure to crop the calyx as close as possible including 1 μm margins around the calyx volume. Then, click OK. The 3D View should now contain the selected calyx terminal only.In the Surpass tree tab on the left, select Add new Surfaces. Select the newly created surface object. In the Create tab, select Skip automatic creation, edit manually. Click Settings and select Render on Slicer. Use the slider Slice Position in the Draw tab to select a slice in the middle of the image volume in which the calyx terminal is clearly visible.In the Mode tab under Drawing Mode, select Magic wand, click Draw. Using the mouse cursor, create line-abound surfaces with the same pixel intensity.When not in Draw mode, vertices of the detected surface can be re-positioned with the mouse while holding down the T button and deleted using the D button.Adjust the surface area carefully to properly represent the dimensions of the calyx terminal.When satisfied with the selection, select the next slice from the Slice position slider and repeat steps D9–D13. Repeat this process for all slices until the whole calyx terminal is selected (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4799/bioprotoc-13-17-4799-g002.jpgFigure 2. 3D reconstruction of the calyx of Held presynaptic terminal.

    "Click Create Surface at the bottom of the Draw tab and turn off Render on Slicer.Using the tools in the Edit tab, the generated surface can be visually inspected and verified.If multiple surfaces have been created that should be merged into a single surface, select the surfaces to merge and click the Unify button located in the Edit tab.In the Statistics tab, select Selection. In the drop-down menu, select Specific Values. Then, select Area and Volume from the drop-down menu below. Data can be exported to CSV or XLS format using the Export Statistics buttons."
