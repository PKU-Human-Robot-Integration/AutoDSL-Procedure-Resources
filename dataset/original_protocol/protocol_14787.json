    "All mouse experiments were done in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of LSU School of Medicine. All instruments must be autoclaved prior to dissection.\n1. Preparation of Primary Cells from Mouse Breast Tumors\nUse a mouse model that was genetically engineered with the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus Polyoma Middle T-Antigen (MMTV-PyMT-transgenic mouse), which spontaneously develop tumors as previously described 6.\nSacrifice mice with Isoflurane (99.9%) and spray 75% ethanol to ensure a sterile environment (Figure 1A).\nOpen the skin from the area of the urethral orifice to the neck with scissors. Pin the skin down to allow easy access to organs (Figure 1B).\nIsolate the mammary breast tumor and wash with cold sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) (Figure 1C).\nTransfer the tumor to a sterile 10cm tissue culture plate and chop it with a sterile razor blade and scissors to approximately 1 mm3 pieces. Subsequent steps should be performed in a sterile laminar flow hood.\nIncubate the chopped tumor tissue with Collagenase dissolved in serum free DMEM media at a final concentration of 1mg/ml on a rocker for 2 hr at 37 °C. Centrifuge the tumor tissue suspension for 3 min at 200 x g.\n\tNOTE: The Collagenase incubation is essential for enzymatic dissociation of the tissue.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the precipitate 3 times with PBS (pH 7.4) by centrifuging for 3 min at 200 x g. After the final wash, decant the supernatant.\nResuspend the tissue with 2 ml of trypsin EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C while nutating. Centrifuge the suspension for 3 min at 200 x g and repeat the washes.",
    "Resuspend the tissue pellet in normal growth medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 2X pen/strep) onto a 10cm plate. Change the media every day for the next 3 days. Culture cells until desired cell number is obtained.\n\tNOTE: Approximately 1x107 cells will be isolated from this procedure. Other mouse mammary tumorigenesis models, such as MMTV-Neu, give lower yield of cells when compared to MMTV-PyMT. When using models that produce a lower yield, it is beneficial to begin with a larger tumor and culture cells longer.\n2. Mouse Lung Extraction to Visualize Lung Metastasis\nPrior to lung extraction, remove the liver and the diaphragm. Dislodge the ribs without disturbing the lungs.\nWith a fine pair of scissors, open the upper part of the trachea which is closer to the jugular vein.\nUsing a catheter, inject an agent such as 1 ml of Z-fix or India ink through the trachea to fill the lungs (Figure 2A). Embed the Z-fix Lungs in paraffin.\nDe-stain the lungs injected with India ink in Fekete’s solution (100 ml 70% alcohol, 10 ml of 10% buffered formalin, and 5 ml of glacial acetic acid) for 5 min. Define tumor nodules at secondary sites with a ≥ 0.5 mm in diameter, determine the nodules as metastasis.\n\tNOTE: Due to bronchi and bronchiole blockage by the tumor, tumor nodules cannot absorb 15% India ink, and thus normal lung tissue will be in black, and tumor nodules will be in white color 7. This will allow visualization of individual tumor nodules (Figure 2B).\n3. Preparing Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) from Mouse Embryos\nSacrifice pregnant mice with Isoflurane (99.9%) and spray 75% ethanol to ensure a sterile environment.\nOpen the skin from the area of the urethral orifice to the neck with scissors and isolate the embryos from the uterus.",
    "Be careful not to disturb the embryos when opening the skin.\nRemove the uterine horns and rinse them in cold sterile PBS (pH 7.4).\nSeparate the embryo from its placenta very carefully and place embryos in a 10cm plate containing ice cold PBS (pH 7.4).\nRemove the head, liver and gut from the embryo and place the remaining portion in a 12 well tissue culture plate containing PBS (pH 7.4).\nTransfer the embryo body to another 12 well plate containing trypsin EDTA and cut into small pieces (~ 1 mm3) using a sterile razor blade and scissors. Incubate the chopped material with 5 ml of trypsin EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C.\nInactivate trypsin by adding 1 ml Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) to the chopped embryos. Centrifuge the suspension at 200 x g speed for 10 min, carefully remove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet with 1 ml of warm DMEM medium and transfer all the contents to a 10cm dish containing 10 ml of DMEM (with 20% FBS and 2X Penicillin/Streptomycin).\nChange the medium every day for two days. Culture the cells until desired cell number is attained.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
