    "All methods described have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Haifa.\n1. Experimental Set-up\nArena\nConstruct the experimental arena for mice (Figure 1A,D) by placing a white or black (depending on the animal's color) plexiglass box (37 cm x 22 cm x 35 cm) in the middle of an acoustic chamber (60 cm x 65 cm x 80 cm, made of 2 cm thick wood coated on the inside with 2 cm thick foam). For the light, remove a strip (2 cm wide, 10 cm below the ceiling of the chamber) of the foam around the acoustic chamber (besides the door), and attach an LED strip with either red or white light bulbs. Make sure the light is as uniform as possible around the arena to prevent reflections.\nConstruct the arena for rats similarly to the one described above for mice, with different dimensions that appropriately fit the size of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Figure 1G). Place a black plexiglass box (50 cm x 50 cm x 40 cm) in the middle of an acoustic chamber (90 cm x 60 cm x 85 cm, made of 2 cm thick wood coated on the inside with 2 cm thick foam).\nChambers",
    "For mice, create two black or white (depending on the fur color) triangular chambers (12 cm isosceles, 35 cm height, with the floors closed) from 6 mm thick plexiglass. Locate them in two randomly selected opposite corners of the arena (Figure 1B,E). Stick a metal mesh (18 mm x 6 cm; 1 cm x 1 cm holes) in the lower part of each chamber using epoxy glue to allow direct interactions with the stimulus through the mesh (Figure 1C,F). Mark each chamber in a manner that allows discrimination from the others in a video without giving clues to the subjects (see Figure 1B,E for examples).\nNOTE: Each chamber will eventually contain a social stimulus (mouse) or object (plastic toy, 5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm, with a distinct shape and color; Figure 1C,I insets). Let the epoxy glue smell evaporate for at least a week before usage.\nFor rats, create two black triangular chambers (20.5 cm isosceles, 40 cm height, made of 6 mm thick plexiglass, with the floors closed) and place them in two randomly selected opposite corners of the arena (Figure 1H), each with a metal mesh (25 cm x 7 cm; 2.5 cm x 1 cm holes) covering its lower portion (Figure 1I).\nPlace a high quality monochromatic camera, equipped with a wide-angle lens, at the top of the acoustic chamber and connect it to a computer to enable clear viewing and recording of the subject's behavior using commercial software (see Table of Materials for suggestions).\n2. Behavioral Paradigm\nNOTE: Steps 2.1-2.7 describe the behavioral paradigm for mice. See section 2.8 for specific instructions involving rats.",
    "Make sure that the cages of all animals (subjects: 2-4 month-old male mice; stimuli: 21-30 day-old juvenile mice) remain in the experimental room for at least 1 h before beginning the behavioral experiment.\nFollowing the acclimation period, insert two empty chambers into the arena randomly at two opposite corners. Place the subject in the middle of the arena for 15 min of habituation. During that time, place the two social stimuli, each in a different chamber located out of the arena for habituation. Place an object (a plastic toy, 5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm, with a distinct shape and color) in another chamber.\nTo perform the social preference (SP) test, start video recording and keep recording until the end of the test.\nRemove the two empty chambers and immediately insert the object and one of the social stimuli, each in a distinct chamber. Locate these chambers randomly in the opposite corners of the arena that were empty during habituation. Allow the subject to interact with the stimuli for the 5 min of the SP test. At the end of the test, stop recording.\nFollowing the SP test, remove the stimuli-containing chambers from the arena and leave the subject in the empty arena for 15 min. Clean the chambers from outside with 10% ethanol wipes.\nTo perform the social novelty preference (SNP) test, start video recording and insert two chambers into the arena: one containing the same social stimulus used for the SP test (familiar stimulus), and the other containing the novel social stimulus. Place these chambers randomly in two opposite corners of the arena, making sure these locations were not used for the SP test. Allow the subject to interact with the stimuli for the 5 min of the SNP test.",
    "At the end of the SNP test, stop video recording, remove the subject and chambers from the arena, and place the subject back in its home cage. Leave the stimuli in the chambers for the next experiment (with another subject) or return them to their home cages. Clean the arena and chambers with running water followed by 10% ethanol and let dry.\nBehavioral paradigm for rats\nFor rats, repeat the behavioral paradigm described in steps 2.1-2.7, with two modifications: 1) handle the rat subjects and habituate the social stimuli to the chambers for 2 days (10 min every day) prior to the experiment; and 2) extend the SP test for 15 min to give the rats a longer period of exposure to social stimuli. Later, restrict the analysis of the SP test to the initial 5 min.\nNOTE: At least one arena and five chambers are needed in order to run a single session.\n3. Using the TrackRodent GUI for Behavioral Analysis\nNOTE: See the upper panel of Figure 2A for the TrackRodent GUI.\nOpen MATLAB (tested with 2014a-2019a) and choose the TrackRodent folder.\nAdd all subfolders to the working path by right-clicking on each folder and selecting Add to Path | Selected Folders and Subfolders.\nType TrackRodent in the command window and press Enter.\nUpload a single file or multiple video files (AVI or MP4 format) by selecting Load session file (AVI).\nA movie inspector, allowing the inspection of the video clip frame-by-frame, will immediately be opened for the first file in the list (Figure 2A). Use it to examine the video clip and define the first and last frames of the segment to be analyzed. Record the numbers of these frames, which will be required later. Close the window when done.",
    "For inspecting additional video files, open the video inspector at any time by pressing Inspect movie and selecting a specific video file.\nSelect the species tested (mouse or rat; mouse is the default).\nExclude all the areas that may interrupt the tracking, in accordance with the colors of the subject and arena (black or white).\nTo exclude a given area, press Exclude area, and after the cursor changes to a cross shape, mark all corners of the area for exclusion. When done, right-click on the mouse, then double left-click the center of the marked area. The excluded area will become a shade of red on the screen. Repeat this procedure to exclude as many areas as needed.\nTo remove an area from exclusion, press Remove excluded area, then (using the crossed cursor) click on the area to be removed from exclusion.\nTo define each chamber as a 'stimulus' area, for automatic detection of its investigation by the subject, choose the shape of the 'stimulus' area to be either polygon or elliptical by checking the appropriate box, then pressing Stimulus X (where \"X\" represents 1, 2, or 3). Mark the 'stimulus' areas similarly to the excluded areas, which will then become yellow in color. For changing the location of a specific 'stimulus' area, press Stimulus X again and mark the new area location (this will automatically update the location).\nNOTE: Choose the different stimuli number in a consistent manner for all files (i.e. object as stimulus 1 for all the SP test files).",
    "To track the presence of the subject in a specific virtual compartment inside the arena, choose the shape of the 'compartment' area (polygon or elliptical), then press Compartment X (where \"X\" represents 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Mark the 'compartment' areas similarly to the excluded or stimuli areas, which will then become blue in color. For changing the location of a specific 'compartment' area, press Compartment X again and mark the new area location (this will automatically update the location).\nChoose the desired algorithm (BlackMouseBodyBased was used for the video) from the list (see available algorithms in Figure 2B).\nWrite the numbers of starting and ending frames for the analysis in the corresponding edit boxes of the GUI.\nChoose a threshold for detecting the subject body.\nNOTE: Most algorithms use the \"Low\" threshold only, while the head directionality-based algorithms use the \"High\" threshold, as well. For the \"Low\" threshold, choose a level that includes the mouse/rat body without the tail (as much as possible), while the \"High\" threshold should also include the tail. In the case of using head directionality-based algorithms, the software will determine the head location as being opposite to the tail location.\nNOTE: The software will later on ignores small objects detected using the chosen threshold.\nTo evaluate automatic detection of the subject borders for a given threshold, insert a value to the relevant threshold field and press Enter on the keyboard.\nWhen choosing multiple files, move to the next file (using the Next button at the top) and select the appropriate definitions for each file. When finished, verify the parameters and area locations for all files by moving between each, using the Previous and Next buttons at the top of the GUI.",
    "NOTE: The definitions of all areas and parameters are specific to a given file.\nFor starting behavioral analysis of all selected files, move to the first file and press Start.\nAt the end of the analysis, a results file (.mat file) is saved for each movie in the same directory of the movie files.\nNOTE: If the slow (non-fast) version of the algorithm is used, it will also save a version of the movie with a white cross of the center of body mass, which changes its color every frame that is detected as investigatory, unless the Save analyzed movie toggle button of the GUI is unchecked. This version of the movie (saved in the same directory, with the same name as the original movie, with the suffix 'analyzed movie') can be used offline to evaluate the quality of the automatic detection performed by the system.\n4. Using the TrackRodent GUI for Results Presentation\nNOTE: See the lower panel of Figure 2A for results presentation.\nTo inspect the results of each movie file, press Load results file and choose the .mat files generated by the behavioral analysis.\nMove between the toggle buttons to examine onscreen any of the following analyses: Mouse location trace (Figure 2A); Compartments occupation along session (if 'compartments' were defined, not shown); Stimuli exploration along session (Figure 2C); Total time in compartments (if 'compartments' were defined, not shown); and Total stimuli exploration time (Figure 2D).",
    "NOTE: 'Stimulus' areas are areas in which the software evaluates subject interaction, while 'Compartment' areas are areas in which the software tracks the presence of the subject. Stopping the analysis using the Stop analysis button will automatically save the results generated up to the last analyzed frame. For most computers, it should be possible to upload and analyze as many as 20 movies at once (depending on computer performance).\n5. Using the TrackRodentPopulationSummary GUI for Population Analysis (Figure 2E)\nOpen MATLAB (tested with 2014a-2019a) and choose the TrackRodent folder.\nType TrackRodentPopulationSummary in the command window and press Enter.\nUpload multiple TrackRodent results files (.mat format) by pressing Choose results files.\nFill in the numbers of Last frame for analysis, Test name, Stimulus 1 name, and Stimulus 2 name.\nChoose the desired analyses from the list of optional analyses by checking all appropriate boxes.\nChoose the Export results to a speadsheet by checking the appropriate box to extract all the results of the checked analyses as a single spreadsheet file.\nPress Start and wait until analysis complete.\nNOTE: This concludes the analysis. The software can be used to analyze the results of as many movie files as desired, given that they were all behaviorally analyzed using the TrackRodent software. The analysis performed by the software assumes video recording at a frame rate of 30 Hz. In the case that a different frame rate was used, multiply the time by 30 and divide by the frame rate used for recording to convert it to the correct value (s).\nSubscription Required.
