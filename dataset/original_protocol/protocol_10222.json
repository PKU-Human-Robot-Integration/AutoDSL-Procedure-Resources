    "NOTE: Read the MSDS for reagents and follow all chemical safety measures as required by local institution.\n1. Preparation of MCP-1 PAMs\nPreparation of MCP-1 peptide\nWeigh out 0.25 mmol of Fmoc-L-Lys(Boc)-Wang in a reaction vessel (RV). Rinse the side of the RV with 5 mL dimethylforamide (DMF) in a chemical fume hood.\nLoad the RV onto an automated benchtop peptide synthesizer. Load pre-packaged amino acid vials, N'-CYNFTINRKISVQRLASYRRITSS-C', from the C to N-terminus. Include an empty vial at the end for the final deprotection step.\n\t\tNOTE: A scrambled peptide with sequence, N'-CNNSIIRSKQVLRSTRYFRSATYK-C', can also be synthesized using the same protocol.\nOnce synthesis is finished, transfer the peptides on resin from the RV to the scintillation vial with 2-3 mL methanol until all of the resins are transferred. After the resin has sunk to the bottom, remove the methanol supernatant and evaporate the remaining until dry. Vacuum dry for an additional 2 h or overnight at room temperature.\nMake 12 mL cleavage solution containing trifluoracetic acid (TFA):ethanedithiol:water:triisopropylsilane at 94:2.5:2.5:1 vol% in a chemical fume hood. Swirl the cleavage solution to make sure it is evenly mixed.\n\t\tCAUTION: Because triisopropylsilane and ethanedithiol are air-sensitive, argon purge stock vials of triisopropylsilane and ethanedithiol for 1 min prior to putting them back.\nPlace the synthesis vessel (SV) onto an arm shaker by clamping near the bottom half of the SV. Transfer peptide-resin to the SV with 2 mL of cleavage solution until all of the peptide-resins are transferred.\nWash the sides of the SV with 3 mL cleavage solution. Close the cap of the SV and shake at 300 oscillations/min for 4 h.\nWeigh out an empty 50 mL centrifuge tube. Record the mass.",
    "After 4 h, drain the cleaved peptide solution from the SV into the 50 mL centrifuge tube. Rinse the SV several times with the remaining cleavage solution.\nEvaporate cleaved peptide solution with nitrogen until there is less than 4 mL remaining in the centrifuge tube.\nAdd 36 mL of ice-cold ether to the peptide-cleaved solution.\nVortex the solution until it is completely white or yellow. Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, and decant the supernatant.\nAdd 40 mL ice-cold ether to the tube. Vortex and sonicate again. Repeat the centrifugation process. Decant the supernatant.\nDry the crude PA pellet with nitrogen gas purging until the ether is visibly evaporated.\nAdd 20 mL double-distilled water, vortex, and sonicate until the peptide is completely dissolved in solution.\nFreeze the solution and lyophilize until dry.\nOnce the peptide is dried, weigh out the mass of the centrifuge tube containing the crude peptide. Dissolve the crude peptide in 5 mg/mL water.\nDissolve 25 mg of crude MCP-1 peptide in 5 mL double-distilled water to make a total concentration of 5 mg/mL. Purify the crude MCP-1 peptide by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using 0.1% TFA in water (solvent A) and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (solvent B) as mobile phases on a C8 reverse-phase column. Inject the 5 mL of the peptide into the HPLC.",
    "NOTE: The initial mobile phase consisted of 100% solvent A at a flow rate of 9.0 mL/min. Decrease solvent A slowly to 30% in 27 min and hold at this composition for 3 min. Return the gradient to 100% solvent A over 3 min and hold at this composition for 1 min to give a total run-time of 34 min. Keep the column temperature at 55 °C. Use positive ion source mode for the analysis. Formic acid can be used in place of TFA, if TFA is too acidic for the HPLC column. It is recommended that the organic solvent composition ramp speed should not exceed 2%/min for better separation.\nAnalyze each fraction using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry for the expected product m/z at 2,890.\n\t\tNOTE: Dissolve α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid at 1 mg/mL in acetonitrile/water (50:50 vol%) as the matrix solution. Spot 0.75 µL of matrix solution onto the MALDI plate, followed by 0.75 µL of each fraction. Carry out the analysis using a positive reflective ion mode at a mass range of 500-5,000 Da.\nCombine product fractions, blow off acetonitrile, freeze, and lyophilize purified peptides until dry.\nPreparation of MCP-1 PA\nPrepare a 1.1 molar excess of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene glycol)-2000] DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide to peptide in separate scintillation vials. Dissolve both compounds in double-distilled water to make ~ 15 mg/mL. Sonicate for 15 min or until both solutions are completely clear.\n\t\tNOTE: DSPE-PEG(2000)-Cy5 is synthesized using the same protocol with DSPE-PEG(2000)-amine and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester-functionalized Cy5, except for step 1.2.3, where the pH of the solution is adjusted to 8.5.\nAdd DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide solution to the peptide solution. Vortex and sonicate.\nAdd 1 M NaOH dropwise (1 µL) at a time until the pH of the solution is 7.\nNitrogen purge solution for 5 min. Stir the solution overnight.",
    "Freeze the solution and lyophilize until dry.\nOnce the crude product is dried, dissolve the solid in 5 mg/mL water.\nPurify with HPLC as described above.\n\t\tNOTE: Unconjugated peptide and DSPE-PEG(2000) should elute between 15-30% organic concentration (vol%), while DSPE-PEG(2000)-MCP-1 conjugate should elute between 40-50% organic concentration.\nAnalyze each fraction using MALDI mass spectrometry for the corresponding m/z. DSPE-PEG(2000)-MCP-1 should have a broad m/z peak at 5,760.\n\t\tNOTE: 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid is best used as the matrix for DSPE-PEG(2000)-MCP-1 with MALDI.\nAssembly of MCP-1 PAMs\nDissolve 1.75 mg MCP-1 PAs with 3 mL methanol in a 1-dram vial. Sonicate until the MCP-1 PA is completely dissolved.\n\t\tNOTE: Cy5 amphiphiles can be incorporated at a molar ratio of 10:90 MCP-1 PA for imaging applications.\nEvaporate the methanol under nitrogen in a circular motion while rinsing the remaining methanol off the side of the vial until a uniform film is formed at the bottom of the vial. Vacuum-dry the film overnight.\nHydrate the film with 3 mL of water or phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to make a 100 µM solution of MCP-1 PAMs. Gently vortex and sonicate the solution until clear. Incubate at 80 °C for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The elevated temperature has been shown to accelerate the self-assembly process and allows the peptide component to form the most stable secondary structure, while lowering the critical micelle concentration (CMC)42,43.\nCool the resulting dispersion to room temperature.\n2. Characterization of MCP-1 PAMs\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential\nPlace 100 µM of MCP-1 PAM or scrambled PAM in a cuvette according to the instructions of the DLS or zeta potential instrument.\n\t\tNOTE: DLS and zeta potential cuvettes can be different based on the instrument's instructions.\nEquilibrate the instrument to room temperature. Measure the size and surface charge of the PAM.",
    "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nAdd 7 µL of 50 µM MCP-1 PAM or scrambled PAM onto a TEM grid suspended within a self-closing tweezer for 5 min. Wick away the droplet with a delicate task wipe.\nAdd 7 µL of water to wash the grid. Wick away the droplet.\nAdd 7 µL of 1 wt% phosphotungstic acid for 2 min. Wick away the droplet. Repeat step 2.2.2.\nDry the TEM grid prior to TEM analysis.\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy\nTurn on the nitrogen for 5-10 min prior to use of the instrument.\nPlace 300 µL of blank (water or PBS) in cuvette.\nMeasure spectra at 190-265 nm, 0.2 mm path-length with a 1 s integration time, and a 1 nm bandwidth in room temperature. Collect 3 replicates.\nMeasure 100 µM MCP-1 peptide, MCP-1 PAM, scrambled peptide, and scrambled PAM under the same condition described in step 2.3.3. Subtract from the blank.\nFit the data using a linear interpolation of polylysine basis spectra.\nTurn off the instrument. Wait 10 min before turning off the nitrogen.\n3. In Vitro  Analysis of MCP-1 PAMs\nIn vitro  biocompatibility\nCulture and expand WEHI 274.1 murine monocytes in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol in 37 °C under 5% CO2 to passage 5.\n\t\tNOTE: WEHI 274.1 are suspension cells. When culturing, the media should be replenished every 2-3 days.\nPipet monocytes in media into a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the old media and resuspend in 10 mL fresh media into the centrifuge tube. Mix slowly until cells are evenly distributed in media. Count the cells using trypan blue staining and a hemocytometer.",
    "Dilute cells such that there are 4,000 monocytes per 90 µL of media per well. Add 90 µL of cells in wells of a 96-well plate. Incubate for 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid using the wells on the exterior edge of the plate to avoid differences in evaporation and thermal changes in the plate. Fill the exterior wells with 100 µL PBS.\nDissolve 0.15 µmol of MCP-1 peptide, MCP-1 PAM, scrambled peptide, or scrambled-PAM in 150 µL PBS in separate, sterilized microcentrifuge tubes. Perform serial dilution to make 65 µL of 1, 10, and 100 µM of each sample.\nAdd 10 µL PBS of each concentration in wells containing WEHI 274.1 (total volume: 100 µL per well, 6 lines, 96 total wells). Incubate for 72 h.\nAdd 10 µL (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) in each well. Incubate for 1 h.\nAnalyze the absorbance using a plate reader at 490 nm or based on the manufacturer's instructions.\nIn vitro  micelle binding\nSeed 500,000 monocytes in each well of a 6-well plate in 2 mL of media containing 100 µM Cy5-labeled MCP-1 PAM (10:90 molar ratio of DSPE-PEG(2000)-Cy5 and MCP-1 PA). Incubate for 1 h.\nCollect WEHI 274.1 by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the media.\nResuspend and wash the cells in 2 mL PBS. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the PBS. Repeat the washing process with 2 mL PBS. Aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of cold 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the cells. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nPipet the fixed cells onto a sterile glass coverslip within wells of a 6-well plate. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the paraformaldehyde. Wash and rinse with 2 mL PBS once. Resuspend with 1 mL PB",
    "NOTE: When rinsing, avoid disrupting the cells on the coverslip.\nPut 10 µL of 90% glycerol in PBS onto a slide. Use a needle and tweezer to pick up the coverslip. Dry the edge of the coverslip. Gently place the coverslip onto a slide facedown.\nGently seal the edge of the coverslip with clear nail polish. Place in the refrigerator until ready for imaging.\nUse a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) installed with lasers for Cy5 at λexcitation = 650 nm.\nSubscription Required.
