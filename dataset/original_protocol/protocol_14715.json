    "Ethics Statement\nAll animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Hunter College of The City University of New York.\nNote: Eight BALB/c mice were used in this experimental procedure. Five BALB/c mice were implanted with 5 X 106 BNL 1ME A.7R.1 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells to produce the primary tumors. Three BALB/c mice with no implantations were used as controls. BNL 1ME A.7R.1 is a murine hepatocellular carcinoma cell line that was derived by chemical transformation from the murine non-tumorigenic hepatocyte cell line BNL CL.2. BNL 1ME A.7R.1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).\n1. Pre-surgery\nEnsure that mice for all survival surgeries are healthy. To ensure that mice are healthy, inspect signs of dehydration by tenting of the skin. Do not use mice with any evidence of disease or distress in these experiments.\nWeigh mice to ensure they are not underweight. Ensure that the weight is at least 16-20 grams.\nPrepare 5×106 BNL 1ME A.7R.1 mouse HCC cells for implantation per mouse:\n\t\nAspirate media from a 10 ml 60% - 70% confluent cell culture dish of BNL 1ME A.7R.1 mouse HCC cells. Wash twice with 5 ml PBS. Add 2 ml of trypsin to the dish and incubate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with air and 5% CO2 for 5 min.\nSubsequently, pipette 10 µl trypsinized cells into a manual hemocytometer for cell counting under a microscope at magnification of 10X. Count the total number of cells found in the four large corner squares and multiply the dilution factor by the total number of cells. Then, divide by the number of squares counted and multiply by 106  for the cell concentration (cells per ml).",
    "Using the calculation, collect 5 million cells per mouse in sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Label 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.\nResuspend the 5×106 BNL 1ME A.7R.1 mouse HCC cells in 100 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Keep these cells on ice till implantation in surgery.\nPerform activities required for preparation of mice for surgery such as anesthesia induction and hair clipping away from sterile equipment and materials to avoid contamination.\nInduce general anesthesia in mice by inhalation of isoflurane using an isoflurane vaporizer along with oxygen at a constant concentration flow rate of 1 L per min (approx. 2.1%). Note: The system is self-reliant, and includes a precision vaporizer, an oxygen supply and a charcoal canister that is linked to a breathing circuit needed for gas/anesthetic scavenging.\nEnsure that anesthesia is adequate to prevent the animal from undergoing pain during the surgery. Perform toe-pinch and observe animal for non-responsiveness to confirm anesthesia.\nAt that time, switch the valve line, seal to the box and open to the nose cone.\nAs soon as the mouse is anesthetized, apply a tiny amount of an ophthalmic ointment to the corneas as a preventive measure from drying and damage.\nSubsequently, move the animal to the preparation area, with the nose cone properly placed and connected (for maintenance anesthesia). Prepare the site of the surgical incision for surgery by depilation at this preparation area.\nEnsure that the area of surgery is at a location free of all other activity.\nEnsure that the work surface is sturdy and appropriately sanitized, unsoiled and clutter-free before the surgery. Place a sterile piece of linen or surgical tray over it.",
    "Ensure that the operative field is available to only persons carrying out the surgery. Ensure that the surgical room is cleaned and swept with an appropriate cleaner and sprayed with an appropriate disinfectant.\nEnsure that it is also positioned away from doors and windows as air currents can spread dust leading to contamination of the site.\nPerform the survival surgery with sterile instruments. Either soak instruments in a disinfectant according to manufacturer’s recommendation or autoclave. Use basic sterile supplies that are ready for use.\nSeparate instruments according to function to help prevent contamination of sterile areas.\nShave approximately 1 inch around the site of incision (midline incision) to access the liver of the animal. Remove the hair from the animal away from the site of surgery.\nAfter shaving, scrub the area with a soapy disinfectant (betadine surgical scrub) and wash the excess disinfectant away with sterile PBS solution. Perform this several times, with the entire scrub process lasting approximately 5 min. Remove and discarded the used gloves.\nAfterward, change to protective clothing such as surgical gown, scrub top, and face mask. Next, sanitize hands with proper scrub solution before putting on surgical gloves. Note: This is a necessary step to prevent shedding and contaminating the surgical site with potential contaminants.\n2. Surgery\nProvide an external heat source for warmth throughout the entire period of anesthesia. The animal may experience some hypothermia because anesthesia causes disturbances of thermoregulation; therefore, maintain the body temperature.\nLay the mouse on its back throughout the surgery.\nFix the fore limbs, hind limbs and tail of the mouse to the surgery table with pieces of surgical tapes.\nMake a straight line incision immediately inferior to the xyphisternum.\nUse a sterile self-retaining surgical retractor to expose the liver.",
    "With a syringe having a 20G needle, slowly and carefully inject 100 µl of PBS containing 5×106 BNL 1ME A.7R.1 mouse HCC cells into the right lobe of the liver.\nAfter removing the needle, apply a sterile cotton swab for at least 1 min to stop any potential bleeding due to high vascularity of the liver.\nClose the subcutaneous tissue with an absorbable suture followed by skin closure using surgical clips. Subsequently, clean the wound once again with betadine scrub. Note: This will ensure the closure of the surgical wound.\nSubcutaneously give 100 µl of normal saline.\n3. Post-surgery\nImmediately after surgery, transfer the mouse to a clean cage with a post-surgery identification card to notify caretakers of the mouse condition. Provide food and water. Note: In our experience, a mouse that has just undergone surgery will fare best if housed alone with wet food and water for the initial 24-hr period post-surgery.\nKeep the animal warm with a heat lamp that generates heat not surpassing 38 ºC. Use a thermometer to measure the temperature until the mouse is fully recovered.\nHouse the animal in a cage preferably with paper bedding to ensure comfort.\nAfter initial recovery, monitor the animal for signs of discomfort, bleeding, pain and distress. Give buprenorphine (0.05 -0.1 mg/kg) to relieve pain. Closely monitor the activity, behavior and appearance, as well as water and food consumption for approximately 2 hr. If ambulatory, move the animal back to the area for regular normal housing of mice and continue to monitor at 6-12 hr intervals for 24 hr post-surgery. Perform a weight check if desired.",
    "However if the animal is having issues recuperating, take appropriate supportive care actions. If mice are unable to recover, humanely euthanize mice via CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation. Follow approved institutional guidelines for euthanasia.\nPost-surgery, check for clinical evidence of HCC which is usually observable as significant reduction in body condition score. Note: At this point, a primary tumor has likely developed in the liver and metastatic deposits have likely developed in the lungs.\nAt this point, sacrifice all mice (experimental and control) involved in the experiment by humane euthanasia. Subject the mice to carbon dioxide asphyxiation: very slowly release carbon dioxide into the chamber over a period of 5 -10 min. This will cause respiratory arrest.\nSubscription Required.
