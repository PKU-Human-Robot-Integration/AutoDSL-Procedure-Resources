    "The following protocol has been established as an effective method for isolating fibroblasts from fresh samples of human rectus sheath. Aside from incubation, all steps should take place in a class II or higher sterile laminar flow hood. Once the specimen has been retrieved, it is recommended that samples are sent for digestion as soon as possible (within hours).\nInitial dissection of tissue should produce a suspension of collagenous tissue within the medium, ready for digestion. After overnight digestion, the solution may or may not contain persistent tissue clumps, however these should be greatly reduced in number. Cells should be visible within cell culture flasks from around day 4 after digestion.\nMaterials\nTissue retrieval medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-rec-0004])\nPhosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 10010023 or equivalent)\nCollagenase medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-rec-0002])\nCell culture medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-rec-0001])\nTrypsin-EDTA, 0.25%, phenol red (Gibco, cat. no. 25200056 or equivalent)\n15-ml conical centrifuge tube\nSterile gauze swab\nLaminar flow hood, BSC class II, or equivalent\n10-cm diameter circular cell culture dish\nSterile scalpel, blade size 10\nSterile stainless-steel forceps\nDigital scale\nWeigh boats\nWater bath, 37°C\nCell culture incubator (5% CO2, 37°C, and 95% humidity)\nPipettes (various sizes)\nPipette tips (various sizes)\nSerological pipettes (various sizes)\nPipet controller\n50-ml conical centrifuge tube\n25-cm2 (T-25) cell culture flask\nLight/brightfield microscope\n75-cm2 (T-75) cell culture flask\nTissue retrieval\n1. Prepare an aliquot of tissue retrieval medium. This is best produced as a 10 ml aliquot inside of a 15-ml conical tube, stored at 4°C.\n2. Inside the surgical theatre, once the tissue sample has been harvested from the patient, tissue should immediately be wrapped inside of a sterile gauze swab. The gauze should be rolled up and placed inside the tissue retrieval medium, such that it is fully submerged/saturated.",
    "3. Transport tissue to the laboratory as soon as possible (within hours). It is not necessary for it to be cooled or on ice.\nTissue digestion\n4. Working in a laminar flow hood biosafety cabinet, place the tissue sample into a 10-cm diameter cell culture dish. Wash the tissue with PBS, using a scalpel and forceps to remove any fat, muscle, or peritoneum from the sample.\n5. Move the tissue to a separate dish and weigh the sample for the purpose of making the collagenase medium.\n6. Prepare the necessary volume of collagenase medium.\n7. Introduce a small amount (2 to 3 ml) of collagenase medium into the dish with the tissue.\n8. Mince the tissue thoroughly using a scalpel and forceps for approximately 5 min. Mince the sample until you are left with a pulp-like substance, suspended within the collagenase medium.\n9. Add the remaining collagenase medium, giving the dish a gentle shake to distribute the tissue pieces evenly.\n10. Place the tissue culture dish inside of an incubator set at 37°C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity overnight (15 to 17 hr).\nCell plating and culture\n11. Remove the culture dish from the incubator after overnight digestion. There should be a significant reduction (or complete absence) of solid tissue within the dish.\n12. With regards to the current volume in the dish, add double the volume of warmed cell culture medium and mix gently.\n13. Aspirate the dish contents and transfer them to a 50-ml centrifuge tube.",
    "Optionally, at this stage, 1 ml of trypsin can be added to the empty dish to dissociate any fibroblasts that may have adhered to the dish overnight. The dish should be incubated for 2 to 3 min with the trypsin, then add 3 to 5 ml of cell culture medium, before transferring all of the solution to the same 50-ml centrifuge tube.\n14. Centrifuge the 50-ml conical tube for 5 to 10 min at 800 × g, room temperature.\n15. Aspirate almost all of the supernatant from the centrifuge tube, leaving around 1 to 2 ml of culture fluid as well as all solids/cell pellet within the tube.\n16. Re-suspend the tube contents in 3 to 5 ml of cell culture medium.\n17. Transfer the tube contents to a 25-cm2 (T-25) cell culture flask.\n18. Label the flask (Passage 0) and place it in an incubator for 3 days at 37°C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity.\n19. Change the medium and inspect the cells every three days. For each medium change, remove half the volume of the flask and replace it with the same volume of fresh warmed cell culture medium. Regular inspection facilitates better understanding of how well the cells are multiplying and in what areas of the flask they are doing so. Leave small tissue pieces within your culture dish until the 1st passage.\n20. When confluent clusters of cells have developed (usually 14 to 16 days), the cells will be ready for passaging.\n21. For a T-25 flask, aspirate all culture fluid from the flask, and wash with around 5 ml of pre-warmed PBS.\n22. Remove PBS from the flask and add 1 to 2 ml of trypsin.\n23. Place the flask in an incubator for 2 to 3 min.",
    "24. Remove the flask from the incubator, giving it a brief but firm rasp to dissociate cells from the flask bottom. Inspect the cells under a microscope to ensure they have dissociated.\n25. If successfully dissociated, add at least 5 ml of pre-warmed cell culture medium to the flask, then transfer the solution to a larger T-75 flask while also adding an additional 5 ml of pre-warmed cell culture medium. Return the cells to the incubator.\n26. To further passage cells, repeat steps 21 to 25 with appropriate volumes of medium/trypsin, depending on the flask size.\n27. Once at the 2nd or 3rd passage, cells can be frozen down for future experimentation (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-prot-0003]).",
    "During development of the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-prot-0001], our group identified an alternate protocol which functioned with similar effectiveness, creating confluent groups of cells within 14 to 16 days. Details of this alternate protocol are provided below.\nMaterials\nFetal bovine serum (FBS), high quality\n25-cm2 (T-25) cell culture flask\nTissue digestion\n1. Follow steps 4 through 9 of the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-prot-0001].\n2. Rather than incubating the suspension within the culture dish, aspirate the mixture and transfer to a T-25 culture flask. Place this suspension in the incubator overnight (15 to 17 hr).\n3. The next day, add pre-warmed FBS to the culture flask so that the solution within the flask is supplemented with 20% FBS. For example, if 8 ml of collagenase medium was used inside the flask, add a further 2 ml of pre-warmed FBS.\nCell plating and culture\n4. Plate and culture cells as per steps 18 to 27 of the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-prot-0001].",
    "Once isolated, cell lines often need to be frozen down for later experimental use. During protocol development, our group successfully froze down vials of RSFs after their 3rd passage. These cells were stored in liquid nitrogen before being thawed and re-plated. Such steps are essential to be able to build a bank of healthy cells ready for a variety of experimental work. Below is a description of our cryopreservation and thawing protocol which utilizes a well-established 90% FBS freezing medium, as well as other standard freezing protocol details.\nMaterials\nFreezing medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-rec-0003])\nCell culture medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-rec-0001])\nTrypsin-EDTA, 0.25%, phenol red (Gibco, cat. no. 25200056 or equivalent)\nTrypan blue solution, 0.4% (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 15250061 or equivalent)\nHemocytometer or cell counter\n2-ml cryotubes (Greiner Bio One, cat. no. 122261 or equivalent)\nControlled rate freezing chamber for cryotubes (Corning, cat. no. 432002 or equivalent)\n−80°C freezer\nLiquid nitrogen cell storage\nFreezing cells\n1. Cells should be cultured until they are approximately 80% confluent, after their second or third passage.\n2. Prepare an aliquot of freezing medium.\n3. Dissociate cells by first removing the medium from the flask, then follow a standard trypsin dissociation protocol (similar to steps 21 to 24 of Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.788#cpz1788-prot-0001]).\n4. Once dissociated, add double the trypsin volume of cell culture medium to the flask to inactivate the trypsin.\n5. Aspirate the contents and transfer to a 50-ml conical tube.\n6. Centrifuge the conical tube for 5 min at 800 × g, room temperature.\n7. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of cell culture medium to form a cell stock.",
    "8. Count the cells within the stock using standard trypan blue methodology in either an automated system such as the Countess or manually with a hemocytometer. Count only live cells, aiming for over 90% live cell count.\n9. Add pre-warmed freezing medium to the cell stock so that the cell concentration is at least 1 × 106 cells/ml.\n10. Transfer the cell stock/freezing medium solution into cryovials–each cryovial containing at least 1 ml of solution.\n11. Place all cryovials into a Coolcell freezing storage vessel and immediately transport to a freezer at −80°C.\n12. After around 48 hr, cell vials should be transferred to long-term storage in liquid nitrogen.\nThawing cells\n13. Before beginning to thaw cells, prepare an aliquot of pre-warmed cell culture medium, enough for a T-75 flask, around 10 to 15 ml.\n14. Remove frozen cryovials from liquid nitrogen and immediately thaw in a water bath.\n15. After thawing, immediately aspirate the cryovial contents and transfer them to your warmed aliquot of cell culture medium.\n16. Transfer the warmed medium with cells to a T-75 cell culture flask and place into an incubator at 37°C 5% CO2, and 95% humidity.\n17. Change 100% of culture medium 1 day after plating cells to remove dead cells and excess DMSO."
