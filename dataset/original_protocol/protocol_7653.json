    "Note: Suggested conditions are sufficient to prepare one 24-well tissue culture plate of macrophages and AC for the efferocytosis assay, including flow cytometer compensation controls and fluorescence-minus-one controls for cell gating at Data analysis. THP-1-derived macrophage differentiation Note: THP-1 cells are maintained in 175 cm2 cell culture flasks in RPMI culture medium supplemented with 10% of FBS, 1% GlutaMAXTM supplement, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin medium (RPMIc), at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cell culture is split, and the medium is replenished every other day. Whenever mentioned below, cell transferring and resuspension were performed using disposable serological pipettes. All media and buffers were pre-warmed prior to use. Collect the cell suspension from the flask, transfer to a 50 mL conical tube, and pellet them by centrifugation (400× g for 5 min at room temperature).Dump the medium, resuspend the pelleted cells in 5 mL of PBS, and count them.Transfer 2.4 × 107 THP-1 cells to a clear 50 mL conical tube (Tube A) and centrifuge them.Transfer at least 4.0 × 106 THP-1 cells to another clear 50 mL tube (Tube B). Centrifuge them, dump the media, and resuspend the cell pellet in fresh RPMIc at 4.0 × 106 cells/mL. These cells will be spared to prepare compensation controls (unstained and viability dye single-color controls) and should be kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until seeding.Dump the medium in tube A and resuspend the THP-1 cells in 2.4 mL of PBS (1.0 × 107 cells/mL).Proceed to cell labeling with CellTraceTM Violet or CFSE (working solution concentration: 5 μM) following manufacturer's instructions (Note 1).Add the labeling reagent at 1:1,000 to obtain adequate working concentration, mix by flicking the tube, and incubate for 20 min protected from light in a 37 °C water bath.",
    "Add five times the original staining volume of fresh pre-warmed cell media to the tube and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.Centrifuge the tube (400× g for 5 min).Dump the medium and rinse the cell pellet with 10 mL of fresh pre-warmed cell media.Following the washout step, resuspend the THP-1 cell pellet in 6 mL of fresh RPMIc (4.0 × 106 cells/mL).Seed 250 µL (1.0 × 106 cells) of the cell suspension in tubes A and B per well of a 24-well cell culture plate.Prepare a solution of PMA at 100 ng/mL using RPMIc as diluent.Add 250 µL of PMA solution to each well (final volume 500 μL, final concentration 50 ng/mL).Incubate the plate for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Aspirate all the medium, replenish with 500 μL of fresh RPMIc, and incubate the plate for another 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Macrophages are ready for efferocytosis assay.PBMC-derived macrophage differentiation Note: This protocol uses peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) purified from leukocyte reduction system (LRS) cones obtained from the apheresis of donated blood samples. Monocytes are sorted by adherence to generate primary macrophages. Collect the LSR cone and preserve it at 4 °C until use.Lock one of the LRS cone accesses with hemostatic forceps.Use a sterile surgical scissor to cut the opposite LRS cone access.Insert a 23 G hypodermic needle attached to a 5 mL syringe into the cone, collect the cells, and transfer them to a 50 mL conical tube.Transfer up to 2.5 mL of the collected sample to a 50 mL conical tube. Split the sample into two conical tubes if necessary.Prepare a cell suspension by adding 35 mL of cold PBS to the sample and thoroughly mix by up-and-down pipetting.",
    "Transfer 13 mL of Histopaque®-1077 solution to a clear 50 mL conical tube.Overlay the cell suspension onto the top of Histopaque®-1077 solution without mixing by carefully dropping the cell suspension on the tube wall using a sterile disposable Pasteur pipette.Set up the centrifuge to medium acceleration and no break. Centrifuge the gradient at 640× g for 30 min at 4 °C. If successful, the formation of a gradient with four separate layers should be clear (Figure 1). Carefully manipulate the tube to avoid mixing them up.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231214/20231214214526_3217.jpgFigure 1. Schematics of the gradient obtained by centrifugation to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) Using a disposable Pasteur pipette, discard the top layer (remaining plasma and thrombocytes).Using a new disposable Pasteur pipette, collect the intermediate layer containing PBMCs and transfer to a clear 50 mL conical tube.Resuspend the PBMC layer in 25 mL of cold PBS and centrifuge the cells (400× g for 5 min).Dump the PBS and resuspend the PBMCs in 5 mL of cold ACK lysis buffer (see Recipes).Incubate the PBMC solution on ice for 5 min.Add 25 mL of PBS to the tube, mix by pipetting, and centrifuge the cells.Dump the PBS, resuspend the PBMCs in 5 mL of pre-warmed PBS, and count the PBMCs.Transfer 2.4 × 108 PMBCs to a clear 50 mL conical tube (Tube A) and centrifuge them.Transfer 4.0 × 107 PBMCs to a clear 50 mL conical tube (Tube B) for compensation controls as described in step A2b. Centrifuge the tube, dump the PBS, and resuspend the PBMC pellet in 2 mL of fresh pre-warmed RPMI without serum (2.0 × 107 cells/mL). The cells should be kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until seeding.Dump the medium in tube A and resuspend the PBMC in 2.4 mL (108 cells/mL) of pre-warmed PBS.",
    "Proceed to cell labeling with CellTraceTM Violet or CFSE (working solution concentration: 5 μM) following steps A4a–A4d.Following the washout step, resuspend the PBMC pellet in 12 mL of fresh pre-warmed RPMI without serum (2.0 × 107 cells/mL).Seed 500 µL (1.0 × 107 cells) of the PBMC suspension in tubes A and B per well of a 24-well cell culture plate and gently swirl the plate to evenly distribute the cells. Spare 2–3 of the wells seeded with labeled PBMCs (from tube A) to confirm the amount of differentiated macrophages immediately before proceeding to the efferocytosis assay.Incubate the plate for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Thoroughly rinse each well thrice with pre-warmed PBS to remove unattached leucocytes. Monocyte sorting by adherence should give on average 1.0 × 106 cells/well.Aspirate all the medium and replenish with 1 mL of pre-warmed RPMI supplemented with 10% of human serum (RPMIh) per well.Incubate the plate for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Add 1 mL of fresh pre-warmed RPMIh per well and incubate the plate for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Lift the macrophages of 2–3 wells using a cell scraper and count cells to confirm cell confluence (Note 2).Macrophages are ready for efferocytosis assay.Generation of stained apoptotic Jurkat cells Note: Jurkat cells are maintained in 175 cm2 cell culture flasks in RPMIc at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The medium is replaced every other day. Whenever mentioned below, cell transferring and resuspension were performed using disposable serological pipettes. All media and buffers were pre-warmed prior to use. Collect the cell suspension from the flask, transfer to a 50 mL conical tube, and pellet them by centrifugation (400× g for 5 min at room temperature).",
    "Dump the medium, resuspend the pelleted cells in 5 mL of fresh RPMIc, and count them.Transfer 3.0 × 107 Jurkat cells to a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge them.Dump the medium and resuspend the pelleted cells in 3 mL of fresh RPMIc.Transfer the cells to a tissue culture dish (100 mm × 20 mm).Using the UV crosslinker, irradiate the tissue culture dish at 50 mJ/cm2 (Notes 3 and 4).Collect the irradiated cells and transfer them to a clear 50 mL conical tube (Tube A).Rinse the tissue culture dish to collect remaining cells with 9 mL of PBS and transfer the suspension to Tube A. Transfer 2.0 mL of the cell suspension (5.0 × 106 cells) from Tube A to another clear 50 mL tube (Tube B). Centrifuge them, dump the media, and resuspend the pelleted cells in 10 mL of fresh RPMIc. These cells will be spared to prepare experimental control tubes FMO AC 1 and FMO AC 2 (Figure 1).Centrifuge the remaining cells in tube A, discard the medium, and resuspend the cells in 3 mL of PBS (1.0 × 107 cell/ mL).Proceed to cell labeling with CellTraceTM Far Red (working solution concentration: 1 μM) or pHrodoTM Red (working solution concentration: 5 nM), following steps A4a–A4d (Notes 5 and 6).Following the washout step, resuspend labeled ACs in 10 mL of fresh RPMIc.Transfer the cell suspensions in Tube A and B to separate tissue culture dishes.Incubate them for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow apoptosis to proceed.Collect the ACs and transfer them to 50 mL conical tubes.Rinse the tissue culture dish to collect remaining cells with 10 mL of pre-warmed PBS and transfer the suspension to Tube A.",
    "Centrifuge the AC tubes, discard the medium, resuspend the cells in 5 mL of RPMIc or RPMIh (if using THP1- or PBMC-derived macrophages assays, respectively), and count them.Adjust the cell concentration to 5.0 × 106 AC/mL with RPMIc or RPMIh and proceed to efferocytosis assay.Efferocytosis assay and sample preparation for data acquisition Rinse the plate of CFSE-labeled macrophages with 500 μL of pre-warmed PBS per well.Transfer 200 µL of the labeled AC 1 preparation in tube A to each well of the experimental group for single uptake or first round of continual uptake. This should give a 1:1 macrophage to AC ratio (cell ratio may vary according to experimental settings).Transfer 200 µL of the unlabeled AC 1 preparation in tube B to each well of the FMO AC 1 control group (Figure 1).Gently swirl the plate to evenly distribute the ACs.Incubate the plate for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.If performing single uptake, proceed to step D11.If performing continual efferocytosis assay, incubate the plate for 18 h instead at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Proceed to step D6 (Note 7).Remove the cell medium in each well and rinse the plate thrice using pre-warmed 500 μL of PBS per well.Transfer 200 µL of the labeled AC 2 preparation in tube A to each well of the experimental group fed with labeled AC 1.Transfer 200 µL of the unlabeled AC 2 preparation in tube B to each well of the FMO AC 2 control group fed with labeled AC 1 (Figure 1).Gently swirl the plate to evenly distribute the ACs.Incubate the plate for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Rinse the plate thrice with pre-warmed 500 μL of PBS per well.Add 200 μL of PBS to each well.Lift the cells using a cell scraper.",
    "Rinse or replace the cell scraper between each group.Transfer the samples to FACS tubes.Prepare a solution by diluting Zombie NIR in PBS with enough volume for all samples (final dilution 1:400, final staining volume per tube: 50 μL).Centrifuge the samples (400× g for 5 min).Resuspend the pellets in 50 μL of Zombie NIR solution.Incubate the samples on ice for 10 min in the dark.Centrifuge the samples.Dump the solution and rinse the samples twice with 500 μL of PBS per tube. If necessary, resuspend the cells in 250 μL of a PBS solution with 2% paraformaldehyde and incubate for 15 min on ice for cell fixation.Resuspend the pellet in 250 μL of PBS and proceed to data acquisition with a flow cytometer."
