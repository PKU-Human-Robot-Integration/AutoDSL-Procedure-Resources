    "1. Preparing the shRNA Plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli\nGeneration of clonal bacterial colonies carrying the shRNA plasmids\n\t\nObtain glycerol stocks of E. coli carrying target-specific shRNA plasmids and a control plasmid from commercial sources (Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Three different shRNA plasmids were used, targeting different regions of the murine Adamtsl2 mRNA. One shRNA was selected to target the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of Adamtsl2 to facilitate rescue experiments with expression plasmids encoding recombinant full-length ADAMTSL2 or individual ADAMTSL2 protein domains. In addition, a scrambled shRNA plasmid was included as a negative control. Details of the shRNA sequences are provided in Figure 1A.\nThaw the shRNA bacterial glycerol stock at room temperature (RT). Transfer 10 µL of bacterial glycerol stock onto a Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin (LB-Amp).\n\t\tNOTE: LB-Amp plates are prepared by autoclaving 1 L of LB medium (for 1 L: 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of NaCl, adjust pH to 7.0) together with 12 g of agar. Let the medium cool down to ~50 °C and add ampicillin (stock solution: 50 mg/mL in sterile water) to a final concentration of µg/mL (LB-Amp agar). Immediately pour ~20 mL of LB-Amp agar in a 10 cm Petri dish and let the agar solidify before use. 1 L of LB-Amp agar is typically sufficient to pour about 40 10 cm Petri dishes. Petri dishes containing LB-Amp agar are stable for at least one month if stored sealed at 4 °C in the dark.\nSpread bacteria with sterile Drygalski spatula or any other appropriate method to achieve single bacterial colonies. Incubate bacterial plates upside down overnight at 37 °C.\nPlasmid preparation",
    "The next morning, remove the Petri dish with the individual bacterial colonies and store at 4 °C to avoid overgrowth of the bacterial colonies and the formation of satellite colonies. Seal the Petri dish if stored overnight or longer.\nIn the afternoon, add 5 mL of LB-Amp medium into a polypropylene bacterial culture tube. Select a single bacterial colony from the Petri dish cultured overnight with a pipette tip and inoculate LB-Amp medium by ejecting the pipette tip in the bacterial culture tube containing the LB-Amp medium.\nIncubate bacterial culture overnight in a shaker at 250 rpm at 37 °C with the lid loosely attached to allow for aeration.\nTake out bacterial culture tube the next morning and keep at 4 °C to avoid bacterial overgrowth. In the afternoon, resuspend bacteria by vortexing and transfer 1 mL of the overnight bacterial culture in 50 mL of LB-Amp medium in a 250 mL conical flask. Incubate overnight in a shaker at 250 rpm at 37 °C.\nOn the next morning, transfer bacteria to a 50 mL disposable centrifuge tube and centrifuge bacteria at 6,000 x g at RT for 15 min. Remove the medium and continue with step 1.2.6.\n\t\tNOTE: If plasmid DNA cannot be isolated immediately, remove the LB-Amp medium after the centrifugation step and store the bacteria pellet at -20 °C.\nFollow instructions for plasmid preparation kit (midi scale) to extract the plasmid DNA from the bacteria. Assess plasmid DNA quality by measuring the A260/A280 ratio using a spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: An A260/A280 ratio of >1.8 is desirable, indicating high purity of the plasmid DNA preparation. A lower A260/A280 ratio suggests contamination with protein or insufficient removal of extraction reagents. Additional plasmid purification steps may be required.\n2. Culturing and Transfection of C2C12 Cells and Puromycin Selection\nC2C12 cell culture",
    "Thaw C2C12 cells (Table of Materials) quickly in a 37 °C water bath and pour cells in sterile disposable 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 8 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) medium supplemented with 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics (serum-free DMEM) in a cell culture hood. Centrifuge cells for 3 min at 160 x g at RT.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (complete DMEM). Transfer cells to 10 cm tissue culture treated plastic dishes. Incubate cells in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nOn the next day, replace the medium with fresh complete DMEM.\nExpand low passage C2C12 cells on 3−4 10 cm dishes. When the C2C12 cells reach 50−60% confluence, aspirate the medium and rinse C2C12 cells with 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 2 min at RT. Monitor cell detachment under a microscope and extend the incubation time if necessary, until most of the cells are detached.\n\t\tNOTE: Carefully tapping the dish can help to dislodge the cells.\nWhen most of the cells are detached, add 10 mL of complete DMEM to the dish, pipette the volume up and down several times, and transfer cell suspension to a sterile disposable 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge cells for 3 min at 160 x g at RT. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of freezing medium (10% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]/90% FBS).",
    "Transfer two 1 mL aliquots per 10 cm dish in cryovials. Incubate in a cell-freezing container filled with RT isopropanol for at least 24 h in a -80 °C freezer resulting in a freezing rate of about -1 °C per min to avoid the formation of ice crystals. Store cells for long-term use in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: The vendor recommends using C2C12 cells up to passage number 15. Authors' experiences also showed that lower passage number cells showed more consistent and rapid differentiation into myotubes. It is essential to maintain C2C12 cells at low cell density (<50% confluence) to avoid premature onset of differentiation. Differentiating or differentiated C2C12 cells cannot be reverted into the original myoblast state and must be discarded.\nPreparing C2C12 cells for transfection\n\t\nCulture undifferentiated C2C12 cells in a 10 cm dish until they reach 50−60% confluence. Aspirate the medium, rinse C2C12 cells with 10 mL of PBS, and add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Incubate for 2 min at RT, monitor cell detachment under a microscope, and extend the incubation time if necessary, until most of the cells are detached.\n\t\tNOTE: Carefully tapping the dish can help to dislodge the cells.\nWhen most of the cells are detached, add 10 mL of complete DMEM to the dish and transfer cell suspension to a sterile disposable 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge cells for 3 min at 160 x g at RT. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 4 mL of complete DMEM.\nCombine 10 µL of cell suspension with 10 µL of trypan blue in a 1.5 mL reaction tube, mix by pipetting up and down and carefully flicking the reaction tube, and transfer cells to a counting slide. Determine the cell number/mL using an automated cell counter.",
    "Dilute C2C12 cells to 50,000 cells/mL and seed 100,000 cells (2 mL) per well in a 6 well plate to achieve about 40−50% confluence after overnight incubation. Incubate cells in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nTransfection of C2C12 cells with the shRNA plasmid using polyethylenimine (PEI) and puromycin selection\n\t\nPreparation of PEI stock solution\n\t\t\nDissolve 16 mg of PEI in 50 mL of sterile distilled water (concentration of stock solution: 0.32 mg/mL) in a 50 mL glass media bottle with a screw cap. Incubate the solution at 65 °C for 1 h and vortex the solution vigorously several times during the incubation period to completely dissolve the PEI.\nAdjust to pH 8 by adding 15 µL of 1N HCl per 50 mL.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: HCl is corrosive. Concentrated HCl should be handled under the fume hood. Investigators should wear appropriate personal protective equipment.\nFreeze the PEI solution at -80 °C for 1 h with a loosely attached lid and rapidly thaw at 37 °C in a water bath to further enhance solubility. Repeat the freeze-thaw cycle 3x.\nStore PEI stock solution in 0.5 mL aliquots for one-time use at -20 °C.\nTransfection of C2C12 cells\n\t\t\nCombine 25.5 µL (8.5 µL/µg plasmid DNA) of the PEI stock solution with 100 µL of 25 mM NaCl in a 1.5 mL reaction tube and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. Combine 3 µg of the plasmid DNA with 100 µL of 25 mM NaCl and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\nCombine the entire volume of diluted PEI reagent with the diluted plasmid and mix by gently pipetting up and down. Incubate for 25 min at 37 °C.",
    "During the incubation time, change the medium of the C2C12 cells intended for transfection to DMEM without FBS or antibiotics.\nAdd the PEI/DNA transfection mix to C2C12 cells drop by drop and mix constantly by carefully moving the cell culture dish. Incubate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 6 h, change the medium to complete DMEM.\nPuromycin selection\n\t\t\n24 h after transfection, switch medium to selection medium (complete DMEM plus 5 µg/mL puromycin). Continue puromycin selection until puromycin-resistant C2C12 cells are obtained, which typically takes 10−14 days.\nExpand puromycin resistant C2C12 cells at low cell density (<50−60% confluence), i.e., to maintain the undifferentiated state and cryopreserve of 6−10 vials for future experiments as described in steps 2.1.4−2.1.7.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Maintain puromycin-resistant C2C12 cells in the presence of 5 µg/mL puromycin for routine cell culture and expansion. However, puromycin was omitted in the differentiation experiments.\n3. Phenotypic Analysis of C2C12 Differentiation\nNOTE: The methods described below can easily be adapted for general phenotypic analysis of C2C12 myoblast differentiation into myotubes by varying the specific antibodies used in Western blotting or the gene specific primers used in the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis.\nC2C12 differentiation protocol and brightfield microscopy\n\t\nSeed 150,000 cells/well in a 12 well plate. Culture puromycin-resistant C2C12 stable cells in a 12 well plate in selection medium in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Culture C2C12 cells in complete DMEM until they reach ~95% confluence.\nTo induce differentiation of C2C12 cells, replace complete DMEM with serum-free DMEM (day 0 of differentiation). Change medium every two days and follow C2C12 myotube formation using an inverted bright field microscope with camera.",
    "NOTE: Many protocols use 2% horse serum to differentiate C2C12 cells into myotubes. In authors' hands, removing the serum entirely had a similar effect. Insulin is described as an additive to the cell culture medium to accelerate C2C12 differentiation. However, in the current protocol, C2C12 cells reliably differentiated into myotubes within 3−5 days after serum deprivation and addition of insulin was deemed unnecessary.\nMyosin heavy chain (MyHC) immunostaining to visualize myotubes\n\t\nSeed 50,000 puromycin-resistant C2C12 cells per chamber in an 8 well chamber slide in 500 µL of complete DMEM. Culture cells until they reach 95% confluence in complete DMEM (about 24 h).\nTo induce differentiation, switch from complete DMEM to 500 µL of serum-free DMEM (day 0 of differentiation). At the desired time point(s), aspirate the medium and rinse cells 3x with 0.5 mL of PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform all following steps at RT.\nFix cells with 0.2 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS for 15 min.

Rinse cells with 0.5 mL of PBS 3x for 5 min each.\nAfter removing PBS quantitatively, add one drop of mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) per chamber. Coverslip and cure mounting medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. Seal with nail polish.\nObserve C2C12 cells using a fluorescence microscope using the appropriate filter set.\nAssessing knockdown efficiency by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\n\t\nCulture C2C12 cells under differentiation conditions in 12 well plates as described in section 3.1.\nAt the desired time point(s), remove the differentiation medium, rinse the cells once with 1 mL of PBS, and add 0.5 mL of RNA extraction reagent (Table of Materials) per well. Lyse the cells by carefully pipetting up and down and transfer cell lysate to a sterile 1.5 mL reaction tube. Isolate the RNA by carefully following the manufacturer's protocol.\n\t\tCAUTION: The RNA extraction reagent contains phenol. It should be used under a fume hood. Collect the RNA extraction reagent waste and dispose of as hazardous waste. Investigators should wear appropriate personal protective equipment.\nDissolve the final RNA pellet in 20 µL of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. Determine the quantity and quality of the RNA preparation using a spectrophotometer and determine the A260/A280 ratio as a quality measure.\n\t\tNOTE: A typical yield from 1 well of a 12 well plate is 5−7 µg of total RNA with an A260/A280 ratio of 1.8−2.",
    "To digest residual co-purified genomic DNA, dilute 1 µg of RNA in a total volume of 8 µL of DEPC-treated water in a PCR tube. Add 1 µL of 10x reaction buffer and 1 µL of DNase I (1 unit/µL) (Table of Materials) and incubate for 15 min at RT.

    "Seed 300,000 puromycin-resistant C2C12 cells per well in a 6 well plate for Western blot analysis. After 24 h, change medium to serum-free DMEM to initiate differentiation (day 0 of differentiation).\nAt the desired time point(s), collect two 1 mL of serum-free conditioned medium in a 1.5 mL reaction tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g at RT to remove detached cells and cell debris.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is necessary only if ECM proteins or other secreted proteins in conditioned medium are investigated. If the protein of interest is localized in the cytoplasm or is membrane bound, aspirate the cell culture medium and proceed with the cell lysis steps (3.4.7−3.4.12). Cell lysis should be performed in parallel to the protein precipitation from serum-free conditioned medium to minimize proteolytic degradation and other unintended consequences of prolonged storage of the cell layer.\nAfter centrifugation, transfer 1 mL of conditioned medium in a new 1.5 mL reaction tube and precipitate proteins by adding 0.391 mL of a mixture of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and non-ionic surfactant/detergent. Briefly vortex the mixture and incubate for 10 min on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare the protein precipitation mixture directly before use by combining 0.252 mL of 55% TCA and 0.139 mL of 1% non-ionic surfactant/detergent per mL of conditioned medium and vortex briefly.
