    "This study received approval from the Ethical Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine (SAHZU). Full compliance with ethical standards was consistently observed throughout the study duration. Informed written consent was obtained from all participating patients. The inclusion criteria for patients encompassed lumbar disc herniation and lateral recess stenosis, with the primary clinical presentation being unilateral lower limb neurological symptoms. Conversely, the exclusion criteria included lumbar canal stenosis with bilateral lower limb neurological symptoms, lumbar spondylolisthesis, lumbar tumors, and lumbar infections. Details of all the surgical tools and equipment are listed in the Table of Materials.\n1. Patient positioning and anesthesia\nFollowing standard clinical practices, position the patients in the prone position for the administration of general anesthesia. Intravenous premedication with midazolam (1-2 mg) and/or fentanyl (25-150 µg) is recommended. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, induce anesthesia intravenously using propofol (1.5-2.0 mg/kg), with optional lidocaine (20-100 mg) and fentanyl (50-250 µg) (following institutionally approved protocols).\n\t\nAttain muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation (for direct or video laryngoscopy) using rocuronium (0.6-1.2 mg/kg) or succinylcholine (1 mg/kg). Maintain anesthesia with propofol (75-200 mg/kg per min) or sevoflurane (1.0% to 2.0% in 40% to 70% oxygen)16.\n\t\tNOTE: The precise concentration of the anesthetic agents should be determined by an experienced anesthesiologist based on the patient's condition.\nExamine the patient's head for lateral tilt and ensure it does not interfere with tracheal intubation.\nPosition the patient's arms comfortably on armrests located at their sides.\nUtilize cushioning to pad the patient's knees, preventing pressure points and discomfort.\nElevate the patient's toes by padding under their shins to promote proper blood flow. Avoid the nerve pressure (Figure 1A).",
    "Place a cushion on the chest and pubic symphysis junction to suspend the abdomen. Gradually tilt the operating table with the head higher and the legs lower to align the target intervertebral disc as vertically as possible.\n2. Skin marking and incision\nUtilizing C-arm fluoroscopy, identify the working space by targeting the superior sacral notch, the junction between the lateral aspect of the superior articular process and the sacral ala, through anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic views17.\n\t\nMark the junction between the spinous process and the lower facet joint with a red line. Mark the horizontal line at the root of the spinous process with a green line. The intersection of these lines serves as the marker point.\nCreate left and right incisions at the head and tail ends of the marker point for endoscope entry and instrument access. Maintain the incisions approximately 3 cm apart, with each entry length around 1.5 cm.\n\tNOTE: The specific incision size may vary based on the surgeon's preference and patient anatomy. Consider these factors when determining the appropriate incision size for individual patients.\nEnsure that the center of both incisions is 1 cm lateral to the target area to ensure accuracy (Figure 1E).\nIf the iliac crest obstructs the caudal incision, create the incision medially to avoid the crest.\n3. Drape preparation and connecting instruments\nClean the surgical site with an antiseptic solution and drape the patient using sterile surgical drapes and iodine film to maintain sterility (Figure 1F-H).\nEnsure continuous saline flushing during UBE surgery, with careful attention to waterproofing and drainage treatment of the top sheet to prevent hypothermia (Figure 1I).\n\tNOTE: Position the saline bag 50-70 cm above the surgical field to maintain the required hydrostatic pressure, typically set between 30-50 cm of water.",
    "Establish a sterile field by opening all necessary sterile packages to prevent contamination.\nWear sterile gloves and gowns to maintain a sterile environment.\nWhile preserving sterility, connect all necessary instruments and devices to their respective ports or power sources.\nEnsure that all cables and tubing are securely connected and will not be accidentally dislodged during surgery.\nVerify that all instruments work correctly before commencing the surgical procedure.\n4. Establishing the working space\nNOTE: UBE necessitates two small incisions-one for arthroscopic insertion and continuous saline irrigation, and the other for instrument access and saline outflow (Figure 1J-L).\nUtilize a dilator to progressively expand the paraspinal muscles layer by layer, gently pushing soft tissues away to create space. With the introduction of saline, the space is formed and ready for use (Figure 1M). Employ fluoroscopic guidance to pass serial dilators through the working portal and obturator.\nVerify the availability of all necessary equipment and ensure correct connections (Figure 1N).\nAdvance the sheath to the target point through the portal (Figure 1O). Ensure that the sheath and serial dilator are placed in a triangular position at the target point using a C-arm fluoroscopic view.\nMaintain continuous irrigation of both portals with saline to ensure a clear surgical view.\nConfirm the correct positioning of both portals.\nEmploy plasma blades (RF electrodes or ablation electrodes) to coagulate soft tissue and muscles to remove anatomical structures.\nIdentify the surgical landmark-the root of the spinous process of L5.\n5. Bone excision and soft tissue removal\nEmploy a high-speed drill and Kerrison rongeur to resect the lower edge of the L5 vertebral lamina, proceeding laterally to the inner edge of the inferior articular process (Figure 2A,B).\nContinue the removal of bony landmarks until the ligaments are released from the bony structures.",
    "Use Kerrison forceps from the inside out to excise the ligamentum flavum tissue until the extradural fat is exposed, carefully performing cauterization for hemostasis (Figure 2C).\nEliminate the fatty tissue surrounding the nerves and dura mater, identifying the exiting nerve roots and the dura mater (Figure 2D).\n\tNOTE: As shown in Figure 2D, nerve roots can be identified by removing the fatty tissue around the nerves and dura mater.\n6. Extraction of herniated annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus tissue\nVerify the position of the nerve roots.\nEmploy a nerve root retractor to gently retract the nerve roots inward, exposing the herniated intervertebral disc tissue (Figure 2E-G).\nUtilize straight or curved pituitary rongeurs to remove fragments of the disc nucleus pulposus (Figure 2H-I).\nEnsure the complete removal of protruding intervertebral disc and osteophyte tissues to prevent nerve root compression (Figure 2J).\nCarefully cauterize the surrounding tissues to ensure no significant bleeding points in the field of view (Figure 2K-L).\nObserve the general view of the herniated disc nucleus, as depicted in Figure 1P.\n7. Closure of the incision\nTurn off the water inlet: Before closing the incision, ensure all water sources are turned off to prevent contamination.\nCheck for bleeding points: Examine the surgical site for any active bleeding points. If identified, control bleeding with pressure and/or cautery as needed.\n\tNOTE: Be mindful of the potential risk of postoperative epidural hematoma, particularly in the absence of a Redivac drain. This is a crucial consideration, especially for those new to the field.\nSuture the incision: Close the incision using a sterile 4-0 or 5-0 surgical suture, employing a technique suitable for the type of incision and the involved tissues. Ensure knots are securely tied and buried beneath the skin.\n\tNOTE: Administer local closure therapy with a subcutaneous injection of ropivacaine.",
    "Dress the wound: Apply sterile dressings to the closed incision site to prevent contamination and promote healing.\n8. Postoperative follow-up procedures\nInitial postoperative assessment: Perform an initial assessment within 24 h post-surgery to examine the wound and monitor vital signs.\nWound care and management: Instruct patients or caregivers on wound care, including recognizing signs of infection.\nMedication management: Prescribe pain relief and necessary antibiotics, guiding proper usage.\nActivity and rehabilitation: Restrict specific activities and recommend physical therapy or other rehabilitation measures at the appropriate time.\nFollow-up appointments: Schedule follow-up appointments to track healing progress and address any concerns.\nPatient education and support: Supply information resources on postoperative care and recovery, and inform patients about available support services.\nEmergency protocols: Furnish emergency contact details and educate patients on when urgent medical assistance is needed.\nSubscription Required.
