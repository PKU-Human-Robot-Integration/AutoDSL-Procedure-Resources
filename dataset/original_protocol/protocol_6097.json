    "Explant cultureThe day before explant preparation Write all necessary information on each IBIDI video dish at this step (date, sample, condition test). Protect the bottom of the glass dishes from scratches by using a plastic tray. Typically 3 IBIDI video dishes are needed per experiment.Under the hood (sterile conditions), coat the glass coverslips as follows (only the center of the coverslip needs to be coated):Dilute a Poly-L-Lysine working aliquot (2 mg/ml) to 200 µg/ml in 1x PBS (-CaCl2, -MgCl2), e.g., for PLL coating of 3 dishes, add 9 volumes (1,305 µl) of 1x PBS (-CaCl2, -MgCl2) in a 145 µl PLL 2 mg/ml aliquot to obtain 200 µg/ml PLL, and pipet 400 µl PLL in the center of each well. Flatten the drop with the tip (to enlarge it) without touching the glass. Don’t let the drop touch the plastic part of the plate; it will form a meniscus and the central part of the coverslip won’t be correctly coated (Figure 1B').Carefully transfer the dishes in the incubator and incubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.The day of explant preparation Equilibrate all necessary reagents at 4 °C on ice (1x PBS [-CaCl2, -MgCl2], Laminin, L-15, FBS aliquot for Solution 1 preparation, trypsin and pancreatin aliquots, DMEM/F-12 and small aliquots for culture medium preparation–Solution 2).Remove the dishes from the incubator. Under the hood, wash the PLL three times for 5 min each with sterile H2O. Let the coverslip dry completely under the hood (with the cover removed).Dilute Laminin (stock: 1 mg/ml) to 20 µg/ml in 1x PBS (-CaCl2, -MgCl2), e.g., for 3 dishes Laminin coating, add 980 µl 1x PBS (-CaCl2, -MgCl2) to a 20 µl Laminin 1 mg/ml aliquot and apply 300 µl of this diluted Laminin solution to the center of each well.",
    "It will naturally take the place of the PLL coating.Incubate the dishes for at least 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Note: The next steps can be done during this coating.  Prepare the L-15; 5% FBS (Solution A) and store it on ice. Prepare the culture medium (Solution B) and store it on ice until the explants are ready. Set up the material under the hood (stereomicroscope, glass dish containing cold L-15, forceps, scalpels, tips and pipettes (Figures 1B and 1C).Embryo collectionNote: All animal procedures must be approved by an Ethics Committee (for our own experiments, the Ile-de-France Ethics Committee). For each experiment, we typically prepare 20 to 30 explants from a total of 3 to 4 embryos extracted from a pregnant female at embryonic day 13.5 (e.g., 5-6 explants per dish, around 20 explants necessary for 3 dishes).Prepare 1 plastic Petri dish containing 1x PBS to collect the embryos, and keep it on ice.Euthanize the pregnant female in accordance with the approved protocol validated by the Ethics Committee. In our case, pregnant female Swiss mice were euthanized by cervical elongation at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5).Extract the uterine horns containing the embryos from the pregnant mouse (Figure 1A), and collect them in the PBS-containing plastic Petri dish. Proceed now with all the subsequent steps under the hood. Extract embryos from the uterus and the chorion, respectively. Keep them on ice. Transfer the embryos in glass Petri dish containing cold L-15 to the stereomicroscope.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190414/20190414203334_6456.jpgFigure 1.

This piece of tissue will be subsequently called “Olfactory Piece 1” (OP1- Figure 2D). All the subsequent steps are done using the stereomicroscope under the hood, with forceps and microscissors.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190414/20190414203404_7181.jpgFigure 2.

The head, see here on its right lateral side, is transferred into a clean dish. Scale bar = 1 mm. C. Stabilize the head, ventral side up, with forceps (forceps tips are seen on the left), cut the hemi-palate with Moria 9600 Spring Scissors (right), to isolate OP1. Scale bar = 1 mm. D. Detailed view of a dissected OP1. To further dissect OP1, separate the septum and the turbinals by cutting according to the dashed lines. Then, cut the septum in 4 pieces and the turbinals in 5 pieces. This gives OP2s. Scale bar = 200 µm. E. View of an OP2 during enzymatic treatment. The olfactory epithelium layer separates from the lamina propria. Scale bar = 200 µm. F.",
    "Explants with an asterisk are at the correct distance (about 1 mm) to be cultured together in the same dish. The others are too close to each other and should be removed. R: Rostral; C: Caudal. Scale bar = 200 µm.Isolate the upper part of the head by cutting through the mouth on both sides (Figures 2A and 2B). Invert the head to see the under side (Figure 2C). At the E13.5 stage, the palate is not completely closed, and this orientation allows direct observation of the septum separating the right and left nasal cavities.Cut the lateral sides of the developing palate in the horizontal plane (Figure 2C). Once this is done, under the microscope it is possible to see the olfactory mucosa covering this cavity and attached to the septal, dorsal and lateral cartilages. Make a coronal section of the tissue through the septum and the turbinate bones (Figure 2C).Detach the caudal part of OP1 from the olfactory bulb and cut beside the turbinates (Figure 2C, line).Extract OP1 (Figure 2D), and store in L-15 in a 4-well dish on ice. Repeat the same sequence of dissection steps with the other embryos in order to collect all OP1s pieces.The second step of the dissection aims at extracting small fragments of the olfactory epithelium layer from OP1 pieces.Transfer a few OP1s into a clean glass Petri dish containing cold L-15. Use forceps to maintain them immobile, and cut the described below pieces (hereafter referred to as OP2s) using the microscalpel (Figure 2D).Make 4 OP2s with the septum part and 5 OP2s with the turbinates. In the turbinates, cut in the curved areas in order to obtain future explants as flat as possible (they will attach more easily to the glass surface).",
    "Collect all OP2s in one clean well containing L-15 on ice. Prepare the enzymatic solution of Trypsin and Pancreatin by pooling an aliquot of 200 µl 0.25% Trypsin with an aliquot of 200 µl of 4x USP Pancreatin (1:1).Remove the L-15 containing the OP2s and replace it with the enzymatic solution. Avoid bubbles. Incubate at room temperature (30 min. maximum) to allow the Olfactory Epithelium layer to separate from the lamina propria. Facilitate this separation by gently pipetting up and down with a 1,000 µl pipette/tip once or twice during the incubation. To preserve tissue quality, do not exceed 30 min incubation. The lamina propria appears as a white cloudy tissue while the olfactory epithelium as a translucent layer (Figure 2E). When the olfactory epithelium (OE) appears to progressively detach from the lamina propria, stop the enzymatic reaction by adding 45 µl of 10% FBS (Working aliquot 1). Gently mix by pipetting up and down once. Incubate 5 min at room temperature and transfer on ice. Under the stereomicroscope, remove the enzymatic solution and wash 3 times with the L-15; 5% FBS (Solution A). Incubate culture medium (Solution B) at 37 °C in a water bath. Transfer some OP1 into a glass Petri dish, gently isolate the OE tissue from the lamina propria and cut the OE sheets using the micro-scalpel into small pieces of about 50-150 μm diameter; these are the final explants (Figure 2F). Store explants in a clean well containing L-15; 5% FBS on ice. Once laminin coating is finished (after minimum 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2), remove the dishes from the incubator. Remove the laminin (using a pump aspirator or a pipette) and replace it directly by the appropriate volume of culture medium (6 ml in a 50 mm diameter dish).",
    "Arrangement of explants in the dishCollect 5 to 6 explants using a 10 µl Pipette + tip and transfer them one by one directly to the appropriate position. Place the tip as close as possible to the glass surface without touching it (contact would damage the coating). Explants should slowly descend by gravity. Make sure there is at least 1 mm between 2 explants (see Figure 2F for scale). We usually put 5 to 6 explants per dish, forming a cross in the center.Once the explants have settled, carefully put the dishes back in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Explant biotinylation and incubation with streptavidin beadsNotes:After 1.5 days in vitro (DIV), axons are long enough (200-300 µm) to perform micromanipulation experiments to assess axon tension. The protocol involves the biotinylation of the live explants (including their axons), allowing Streptavidin coated beads to attach to biotinylated axons. Biotinylation The reagent EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin is used at 200 µg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C (with gentle shaking):For 3 dishes, use 2 aliquots of 1 mg of Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin.Wait for equilibration at 4 °C and briefly centrifuge the tubes. Resuspend each aliquot in 166 µl DMEM/F-12 and pool (= 332 µl at 6 mg/ml).Remove 3 ml conditioned medium from the culture and store at 37 °C (will be used for Step B2).Take out 500 µl conditioned medium of the culture, add 99 µl of biotin solution and put back in the culture (= 200 µg/ml in 3 ml).Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking.Strepta-beads (ProActive® Microspheres, Streptavidin Polymeric: 3 µm diameter, CP01N-1, Bangs Laboratories, Inc., Polysciences Europe GmbH)The bead density can vary from one batch to another. Our batch had a concentration of 6.826 x 107 beads/ml.",
    "Using a 1/5,000 dilution of these beads, we had a final concentration of 1.36 x 104 beads/ml in each dish, which was to a satisfactory density.First, prepare the Strepta-Beads solution: Note: The 1/5,000 dilution of the beads is performed in 2 steps. Vortex the beads. Predilute the beads at 1/100 in DMEM/F-12 (e.g., 2 µl in 200 µl DMEM/F-12). Make a 1/50 dilution of the 1/100 predilution.Vortex the beads 1/100 and put 60 µl of this predilution in the stored medium (3 ml).Once biotinylation step is complete, wash each culture 3 times with warm 1x PBS (-CaCl2, -MgCl2) and replace with \"Strepta-Beads solution\". Incubate for 30 min (minimum) at 37 °C, 5% CO2.During this incubation step, thaw 1 Working aliquot 3 (BSA10% [v/v] in 2 ml DMEM/F-12) and prepare Solution C (BSA 2% [v/v] 10 ml DMEM/F-12).Add 1 ml of Solution C to the 3 ml culture medium of each culture dish. Keep the dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2, until use.Quality control of the axon biotinylation:In order to check that axons are properly biotinylated, and able to be bound by beads, a quality control can be performed. This quality control consists of detecting biotin using streptavidin, and to verify that beads can bind to axons.Wash once the cultures with 1x PBS. Fix the culture for 15 min with 4% PFA at RT.Wash three times with 1x PBS. Permeabilize 10 min at RT with 1x PBS; 0.2% Triton. Block for 1 h at RT in 1x PBS; 5% NDS; 0.1% Triton.Dilute rat α-Ncam at 1/2,000 in 1x PBS; 1% NDS; 0.1% Triton and incubate O/N at 4 °C.  The next day: Wash three times with 1x PBS. Dilute Donkey α-rat Cy3 at 1/1,000, Strepta-Fitc at 1/400 and Hoechst at 1/1,000 in 1x PBS; 1% NDS; 0.",
    "1%Triton and incubate for 1 h at RT.Wash three times with 1x PBS.Mount the coverslip to the microscope slide with an appropriate mounting medium (e.g., Mowiol® 4-88).Observe the results using a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190414/20190414203453_9854.jpgFigure 3.

The bead is better seen in the inset.Axon tension measurement using Biomembrane Force ProbeThe principle, tools and devices used in our experiments are described in details and illustrated by remarkable figures in Gourier et al., 2008. Therefore, in the protocol below, we will not describe the aspects that are already detailed in that technical publication. We will, however present, the detailed protocol and parameters used for tension measurement of olfactory axons.Micropipette preparationMicropipettes are prepared as described in Gourier et al. (2008), as follows:Elongate a borosilicate glass capillary using the micropipette puller.Using the microforge, as described in Gourier et al. (2008), adjust the micropipette diameter to give an aperture (inner diameter) of about 2 µm, to optimize the holding of the red blood cell by the pipette.Fill the micropipette with culture medium.Fix the micropipette to the micromanipulator mounted on the stage of the microscope and connected to the homemade manometers (Gourier et al., 2008).",
    "Immerse the tip of the pipette in a drop of Solution C deposited on a glass slide for 1 h, allowing the saturation of the pipette glass with BSA.Biomembrane force probe assemblyRemove the glass slide with the drop of BSA solution from the microscope stage.Transport the dish containing the biotinylated explant cultures from the incubator to the microscope stage.Measure the micropipette internal diameter, using the 40x objective and the CCD camera.Add the steptavidin-coated beads to the culture medium and allow them to settle for 3-5 min. Some of them will attach to axons.Add biotinylated Red Blood Cells (RBC) to the culture medium.Catch an RBC floating in the culture with the micropipette, via gentle aspiration (ΔP = 200-250 Pa).Position this captured RBC in contact with a bead attached to an axon and wait at least 2 min.Check that the manipulated bead remains attached to both the axon and RBC, by slowly moving the pipette backwards and forwards. If the bead detaches from either the axon or the RBC, repeat the procedure with another bead attached to an axon.In the favorable cases where the bead remains attached to both the axon and the RBC, proceed with the acquisition of data for tension measurement as follows:The whole manipulation should be continuously recorded using the CCD camera.Pull the micropipette a short distance, induce elongation of the RBC; this often results in lateral deflection of the axon. An equilibrium is rapidly reached between the force induced by the probe and the transverse projection of the reaction force of the axon axial tension.Pull the micropipette again, a bit further, to induce an additional deformation of both the RBC and axon (a second equilibrium is reached).",
    "Repeat gradual force application (through pulling) to acquire several equilibrium stages with different axon deflections, until the bead detaches from the RBC.Note: Axons can be manipulated by pulling (as described above) and/or pushing, allowing the acquisition of more equilibrium stages. Detailed illustrations of olfactory axon tension measurement are provided in Šmít et al. (2017a and 2017b)."
