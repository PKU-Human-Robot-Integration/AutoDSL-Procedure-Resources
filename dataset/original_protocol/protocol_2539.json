    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Immunostaining of microglia marker\nTiming: 3 days\nMicroglia identity can be defined with the following selective markers (Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2171_8.csv\nNote: A unique microglia-selective marker has not yet been found. All listed markers also label other cell types such as blood-derived macrophages, perivascular macrophages, and similar . Thus, a combination of validated markers should be used to investigate microglia cell identity.\nNote: TMEM119 (transmembrane protein 119) has been described as a microglia-specific marker,24[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28] and has been used in various studies to confirm microglia identity.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],25[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29] However, when we analyzed non-isolated microglia embedded in mesenchymal tissue, we could not observe TMEM119 expression in microglia-like cells.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Due to this ambiguity, we decided against including TMEM119 as a selective marker.\nNote: Ideally, the antibodies used for hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells are cross-validated for their specificity in human tissue because several papers only refer to the specificity in mouse tissue. In Bartalska et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] we have validated the above set of markers in human brain tissue.\nHere, we describe an example immunostaining for IBA1, P2Y12, and PU.1 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2171-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Adjust the culture format and the cell number as outlined in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nIncubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2, overnight (∼15–17 h).",
    "Prepare the solutions formaldehyde solution , blocking solution, and antibody solution.\n(Day 1) Fixing microglia-like cells.\nAspirate the medium.\nAdd 200 μL PBS (phosphate buffered saline) per well to wash the cells.\nAspirate the PBS.\nAdd 200 μL of 4% (w/v) formaldehyde solution at room temperature (20°C–22°C) per well (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nCritical: Handle formaldehyde always in a fume hood.\nIncubate cells for 15 min in the fixative at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nCollect the formaldehyde solution with a pipette and dispose it in the aldehyde waste disposal.\nCritical: Formaldehyde is toxic and requires specific aldehyde waste disposal.\nAdd 200 μL PBS per well.\nIncubate cells for 5 min in PBS.\nAspirate PBS.\nRepeat steps 2g–i in total of three times.\nNote: The cells can also wash for longer time.\nPause point: Fixed cells can be stored in 200 μL PBS at 4°C for up to 3 months. To prevent evaporation of the PBS, the dish should be wrapped with parafilm.\n(Day 1–2) Staining of fixed cells.\nIncubate cells in 150 μL blocking solution for two hours at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nCritical: Do not incubate the Ibidi-chamber on a shaker to avoid cell detachment.\nPrepare the primary antibodies in diluting the desired antibody concentration in 150 μL antibody solution per well. For an estimate of the dilution factor, see the list of primary antibodies in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nWell 1: Mix 0.6 μL goat-anti-IBA1 and 1.5 μL rabbit-anti-P2Y12 to get a 1:250 and 1:100 dilution, respectively.\nWell 2: Mix 0.6 μL goat-anti-IBA1 and 0.3 μL rabbit-anti-PU.1 to get a 1:250 and 1:500 dilution, respectively.\nNote: Due to antibody batch effects, each primary antibody has to be validated for their optimized concentration ideally with testing different dilution factors.\nAfter the 2 h, aspirate the blocking solution.",
    "Add the antibody solution containing the desired primary antibodies.\nIncubate the plate overnight (∼15–17 h) at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nNote: It might be beneficial to transfer the plate to 4°C to prevent the denaturation of reagents and evaporation of the solution.\nAspirate the antibody solution.\nPerform the washing step described in steps 2g–j.\nTo perform the secondary antibody staining, prepare in total 300 μL antibody solution and add 0.15 μL goat-anti-Alexa Fluor 488 and 0.15 μL rabbit-anti-Alexa Fluor 647 correlating to a 1:2000 dilution.\nNote: Due to antibody batch effects, each secondary antibody has to be validated for their optimized concentration with varying dilution factors.\nNote: The fluorophore of the secondary antibodies should be chosen based on the excitation/emission spectra available at the microscope.\nAdd 150 μL of the secondary antibodies containing antibody solution into each well.\nIncubate the cells light-protected for 2 h at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nCritical: Light exposure causes fading of the fluorophore signal. Therefore, the Ibidi-chamber should be either covered with aluminum foil or kept in a box.\nAspirate antibody solution.\nPerform the washing step described in steps 2g–j.\nTo stain the cellular nuclei, dilute 0.1 μL Hoechst 33342 (1:5000) in 500 μL PBS to obtain a Hoechst-PBS solution.\nAdd 200 μL of the diluted Hoechst-PBS solution per well.\nIncubated the cells light-protected for 8 min.\nPerform the washing step described in steps 2g–j.\nPause point: The samples can be stored in 200 μL PBS at 4°C in the dark until imaging.\nNote: If the samples are stored longer than 1 week, the Ibidi-chamber should be wrapped with parafilm to prevent dry-out of the samples.\n(Day 2) Imaging of stained cells.\nPlace the Ibidi-chamber into the specimen holder of the microscope.",
    "Note: Ibidi-chambers can only be imaged with an inverted microscope. We used a LSM880 inverted confocal microscope. Alternatively, an epifluorescence microscope or a spinning disk confocal microscope can be used.\nSet up acquisition parameters on the microscope optimized for the excitation/emission spectra of the secondary antibody.\nUse a 20× objective to find the region-of-interest and to determine whether the cells expressed the investigated marker.\nUse a 40× oil immersion objective to focus on small subset of microglia to investigate expression details.\nNote: To distinguish signal from background, a control sample should be imaged at the same time that has been only stained with the secondary antibody.\nAnalysis\nTiming: up to 15 min\nHere, we describe how to process images to take snapshots of the immunostaining of interest.\nSoftware requirements:\nGet access to Imaris and obtain a license: https://imaris.oxinst.com/packages[href=https://imaris.oxinst.com/packages].\nConvert microscope images to .ims files using the Imaris File Converter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nDrag and drop the microscope images into the Imaris File Converter.\nPress “Start all”.\nOpen the converted files in Imaris.\nOpen “Display Adjustment” to visualize individual image channels (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nIf necessary, process the images by clicking the “Image Processing” icon on the toolbar (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nProcess images (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nIn the dropdown box of each channel select “Median filter”.\nSelect the newly generated channel.\nApply “Background Subtraction” for each channel and press “OK”.\nVisualize the channel or channels of interest.\nSelect the icon “Snapshot” (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nNote: As an alternative, the open-source software Fiji/ImageJ can be used.\nPart 2: Beads-based phagocytosis assay\nTiming: 2 days",
    "Microglia have been shown to phagocytose e.g., apoptotic cells, invading microbes, or synapses.31[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30],32[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31],33[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32] This phagocytic behavior can be recapitulated by quantifying the uptake of beads over time.34[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33] To visualize microglia in a non-fixed environment, tomato lectin (Lycopersicon esculentum) can be used, which selectively labels human microglia and blood vessels.35[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]\n(Day 0) Seed collected microglia cells as described in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] – seeding cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5]”.

Meanwhile you can proceed with steps 15 and 16.\nNote: No CO2 and humidity control is necessary.\nSet up the microscope.\nUse a 20× air objective.\nActivate the 488 nm and 568 nm laser channels.\nSet up the microscope so that the two channels 488 nm and 568 nm can be simultaneously imaged and bleed-through is limited.\nSet up a time series with 1 cycle/minute and 80 cycles in total.\nActivate z-stack option.",
    "Activate an autofocus for each cycle to compensate drifting on the z-axis.\nNote: We used a LSM880 inverted confocal microscope. Alternatively, an epifluorescence microscope or a spinning disk confocal microscope can be used.\nStaining of attached microglia cells for live cell imaging.\nPrepare lectin staining solution by adding 0.2 μL tomato-lectin to 200 μL DBPS.\nPre-warm DPBS, lectin staining solution, and Leibovitz’s L-15 medium to 37°C in a bead bath.\nAfter pre-warming the solutions, aspirate the medium from the Ibidi-chamber.\nWash the cells with 200 μL pre-warmed DPBS.\nAspirate DPBS.\nAdd 200 μL of the lectin staining solution.\nTransfer the cells for 20 min at 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: We use a tomato-lectin, which is conjugated to green fluorophore, and the beads are conjugated to a red dye. Alternatively, also other lectins and bead color combinations can be used.\nOptional: If the cell line endogenously expressed a fluorophore, the tomato-lectin labeling step can be omitted.\nLive cell imaging.\nBefore imaging, aspirate the lectin staining solution.\nWash the cells with 200 μL DPBS.\nAdd 390 μL pre-warmed Leibovitz’s L-15 medium.\nProtect the stained cells from light and transfer the cells to the microscope.\nPlace the Ibidi-chamber into the specimen holder.\nSelect a representative region-of-interest for imaging.\nSet a z-stack to acquire the entire volume of the microglia-like cells.\nCritical: The autofocus and the acquisition of one z-stack needs to be finished within 1 min. Therefore, you need to adjust the acquisition speed and number of planes.\nBefore starting the time series, remove the lid of the Ibidi-chamber.\nStart recording.\nAcquire 20 min of baseline.\nMeanwhile, re-suspend beads at 1 mg/mL in pre-warmed Leibovitz’s L-15 medium according to manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Fmp35361.pdf].\nShortly before use, sonicate beads for 30 s at room temperature (20°C–22°C) to homogenously disperse particles.",
    "After the acquisition of cycle 20, immediately add 10 μL of freshly sonicated beads in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium to the Ibidi-chamber without stopping the recording.\nCritical: Avoid touching the Ibidi-chamber while adding the beads to prevent the loss of the region-of-interest. Therefore, the lid should be removed before starting the acquisition.\nNote: It is not necessary to re-suspend the solution since we perform a qualitative description and thus the beads do not need to be equally distributed.\nKeep recording for the remaining 60 min to image the bead uptake.\nIn total, repeat the assay three times from three independent differentiations.\nAnalysis\nTiming: up to 30 min\nIn the following example, we describe how to quantify the microglia uptake of beads as a parameter of phagocytic activity.\nSoftware requirements:\nGet access to Imaris and obtain a license: https://imaris.oxinst.com/packages[href=https://imaris.oxinst.com/packages].\nTo perform the described analysis, the surface rendering function is required.\nGet access to R here: https://www.rstudio.com/[href=https://www.rstudio.com/].\nFor opening and processing the images see steps 6–10. Then apply “Median Filter” and “Background Subtraction (local contrast)” to both channels. Visualize the microglia channel.\nClick the icon “Surface rendering” to create a new surface (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nIn the newly opened window press the blue icon for “Next” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCreate the surface of microglia (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nSelect the “Create” tab.\nIn “Source channel”, select the channel that labels microglia.\nEnter the surface detail resolution and keep it consistent across the experiment. In our analysis, we used a surface detail of 0.2 μm.\nNote: Imaris is automatically adjusting the value in function of the resolution.\nSelect ‘‘Absolut intensity’’ as the thresholding method.\nPress the blue icon for “Next” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nAdjust the threshold with the slider to visualize microglia surface and minimize background. Use the microglia channel as a reference (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).",
    "Press the green button for “Finish” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nNote: This step creates the surface of the microglia-like cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nNext, determine the intensity mean of the 568 nm channel within the microglia-like cell created surfaces. For this, open the statistics of the created surfaces (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nSelect the newly generated “Surface 1” tab.\nSelect the “Statistics” icon.\nFour new tabs will appear (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nSelect “Detailed”.\nSelect “Average Values”.\nSelect “Intensity Mean Ch=2 Img=1”.\nSelect the icon “Export data for plotting” and export data as .xlsx (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J).\nTo visualize the exported data use e.g., R.\nNote: We used the xlsx package21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] to load the excel file into R, the ggplot2 package22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] to generate plots, and geom_abline() to visualized the 95% confidence interval.\nPart 3: Imaging calcium activity after ATP stimulation\nTiming: 2 days\nIntracellular calcium (Ca2+) has been shown to modulate various microglia properties such as proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis.36[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35] ATP (adenosin-tri-phosphat) is an important modulator of microglial Ca2+-signaling by activating specific ionotropic and metabotropic purinergic receptors.37[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36],38[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37] Here, we determine the activity of microglia-like cells based on fluctuations in intracellular Ca2+-events upon stimulation with ATP.\nNote: Fluo-4 is an easy-to-use synthetic Ca2+-indicator39[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38] and suitable for live cell imaging of microglia.40[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39] Spontaneous and ligand stimulated changes in intracellular Ca2+-levels can be assessed with high sensitivity.\n(Day 0) Seed collected microglia cells as described in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] – seeding cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.5]”.

We used 0.5% laser power of a 25 mW Argon-Multiline laser and a gain of 500 (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nNote: Do not stop recording while applying ATP.\nCritical: To prevent the loss of the region-of-interest, avoid touching the Ibidi-chamber with the tip while adding ATP. Therefore, the lid should be removed before starting the acquisition. Pipette the ATP solution carefully onto the surface of medium. Do not re-suspend the medium.\nTo obtain a control, repeat steps 35d–i for the second well. Instead of ATP, add Leibovitz’s L-15 medium at step 35h.\nIn total, repeat the assay three times from three independent differentiations.\nAnalysis\nTiming: 1 h",

We normalized the intensity of each cell to its average intensity throughout the entire 360 s of recording and performed a one-sample t-test to compare different conditions.\nOptional: An alternative approach is PeakCaller, a MATLAB script that can be used for the quantification of intracellular Ca2+-transients.23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22] The output provides various parameters describing the peaks such as amplitude, frequency, rise and decay time and the half maximum width. We used this script to quantify and visualize the sum of Ca2+-events occurring in microglia-like cells within experimental conditions over the whole duration of recording. We used following parameters: required rise = 20% absolute; max. lookback = 700 pts; required fall = 30% absolute; max. lookahead = 700 pts; trend control = exponential moving average (2-sided); trend smoothness = 100; interpolate across closed shutters = true.\nCritical: PeakCaller detects peaks which are not reflecting Ca2+-events. For this reason, we additionally filtered the output in R by including only peaks with a height >0.15 and a FWHM >5.",
    "Part 4: Inflammation assay\nTiming: 2 days\nPathological conditions caused by injuries or infections increase the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1β, IL-6 and TNFα in microglia.33[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32] In this protocol, we identify changes in the mRNA transcript levels in response to inflammatory stimuli.
