    "All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The patients provided written informed consent for participating in the study. Patient inclusion criteria: any patient with hemodynamic instability or abdominal pain/distension. Patient exclusion criteria: patient refusal.\n1. Transducer selection\nSelect a low-frequency linear transducer (1-5 MHz) (see Table of Materials) to visualize organs deeper than 6 cm in the body1,19.\nIf available, select the curvilinear low-frequency probe as its wide footprint maximizes spatial resolution of intra-abdominal organs.\nIf the curvilinear probe is not available, select any low-frequency probe such as a sector array probe (aka \"phased array probe\", see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The sector array probe is sometimes colloquially called the \"phased array probe\". However, this latter colloquial term is misleading because all modern ultrasound transducers (including even linear high-frequency transducers) use electronic phasing to steer the ultrasound beam20,21,22, so what distinguishes the sector array from other ultrasound probes is not that it is a \"phased array\" (all modern transducers are) but that this probe traces out a sector arc. But because many point-of-care ultrasound providers use the term \"phased array\" to refer to the sector array probe, this manuscript will mention both terms. However, to those interested in the mechanics of how ultrasound machines work, sector array probe is the technically accurate name and is already widely used by ultrasound experts outside of the point-of-care ultrasound world18,23,24,25,26.\nIf the e-FAST exam is being performed and is being used to screen for pneumothorax, use a linear high-frequency probe (≥ 5 MHz, see Table of Materials) for that application and then resume using a low-frequency probe for the remainder of the FAST/e-FAST exam.",
    "2. Machine settings and machine placement\nMode\n\t\nSelect abdominal mode, which will place the indicator on the left screen and maximize spatial resolution while minimizing temporal resolution.\n\t\tNOTE: In contrast to \"abdominal\" mode, \"cardiac\" mode will maximize temporal resolution at the expense of spatial resolution, settings that are optimal for visualizing the fast-moving structures within the heart but unhelpful for visualizing the slow-moving structures in the abdomen or screening for gross fluid in the pericardial sac.\nMachine placement\n\t\nPlace the ultrasound machine on either the patient's left or right side but ensure that the sonographer has a direct line of sight to both the machine's screen and to the patient simultaneously so that the operator can manipulate both the ultrasound probe and the ultrasound machine settings concurrently.\nImage acquisition preset\n\t\nSet the ultrasound machine's image acquisition technique to prospective collection. If the operator prefers \"retrospective collection, \" they will need to reverse the order of any paired steps involving fanning the ultrasound probe and click Acquire before image acquisition.\n3. Patient positioning\nPosition the patient supine with the chest and abdomen exposed1.\nFor Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) and Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ) views, abduct the patient's arms at least 5 inches away from their body to allow access for the ultrasound probe to reach the patient's flanks.\n4. Scanning technique\nApply gel to the ultrasound probe prior to attempting each view.\nPoint indicator mark cranially for coronal or sagittal views and toward the patient's right side for transverse views.\n5. FAST exam cardiac views\nSubxiphoid (aka subcostal) 4-chamber view\n\t\nPlace the probe on the anterior abdominal wall just caudal to the xiphoid process in the midline or slightly to the patient's right1.",
    "Orient the ultrasound beam transversely with the indicator to the patient's right and the probe nearly flat against the patient's abdomen and directed towards the patient's left shoulder1 (Figure 1).\nAdjust probe positioning and screen depth to obtain a view of the four cardiac chambers visualized in the center of the ultrasound image (Figure 2; Video 1).\nAdjust the gain until the intracardiac blood appears uniformly black (anechoic) with just a few specks of grey27.\nClick on Acquire.\nInspect the circumference of the heart for a similar dark hypoechoic stripe around the myocardium (Figure 2; Video 2).\nParasternal long-axis view (optional)\n\tNOTE: In some patients, the subxiphoid window may provide ambiguous findings or inadequate visualization of the pericardium due to abdominal obesity or distended/gas-filled stomach1. In these circumstances, the parasternal window may provide an alternative window to screen for pericardial effusion.\n\t\nPlace the probe along the left sternal border just caudal to the clavicle with the indicator mark pointing toward the patient's left hip (Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: The transducer indicator mark is pointed toward the patient's left hip and not toward the right shoulder, as would be done when performing transthoracic cardiac ultrasound because the entire FAST exam is traditionally performed in \"abdominal\" rather than \"cardiac\" mode.\nWhile keeping the probe indicator pointed toward the patient's left hip, slide (translate) the probe caudally examining each rib interspace until the heart disappears and making a note of which interspaces provided a useful view of the heart.\nSlide (translate) the probe back cranially to the interspace or spaces that provide the best visualization of the heart.\nAdjust probe positioning to obtain a view with the following structures visible: descending thoracic aorta, left atrium, left ventricle, left ventricular outlow tract, right ventricle, and pericardium (Figure 4; Video 3).",
    "Adjust screen depth so that at least 3-6 cm of depth is visible deep to the descending thoracic aorta (Figure 4; Video 3; Video 4).\nAdjust gain as mentioned in step 5.1.4.\nClick on Acquire.\nInspect the circumference of the heart for a dark hypoechoic stripe that dissects into the plane between the heart and the descending thoracic aorta (Figure 4).\n6. FAST exam abdominal windows\nRight upper quadrant (RUQ) window\n\t\nPlace the ultrasound probe in the coronal plane on the patient's right side along the mid-to-posterior axillary line in the 7th to 9th intracoastal space with the probe indicator towards the patient's head (Figure 5)1,28.\nAdjust the probe positioning to obtain a view containing the following structures: (1) liver; (2) right kidney; (3) hepato-renal interface (a potential space also called Morison's pouch) (Figure 6; Video 5)1.\nAdjust screen depth so that the hepato-renal interface occupies the middle third of the screen (Figure 6; Video 5).\nAdjust the gain until the liver and kidney appear slightly hyperechoic (tissue echogenicity) but not so dark as completely black and not so bright that they are indistinguishable from their hyperechoic capsules (Figure 6; Video 5). Click on Acquire.\nFan through the hepato-renal interface anteriorly to posteriorly and back during the video acquisition (Video 6).\nInspect the hepato-renal recess for a hypoechoic or anechoic stripe between the caudal-most tip of the liver and the inferior pole of the kidney, as this is the most sensitive site for detection of free peritoneal fluid in both the RUQ and usually the entire FAST exam in a supine patient29 (Figure 6; Video 7).",
    "If the initial view is negative, continue the search for fluid by sliding (translating) the probe caudally into the paracolic gutter and/or cranially to view the hepato-diaphragmatic space between the liver and the diaphragm28,29 (Video 8).\n\t\t\nFrom the cranial-most RUQ view, visualize the right pleural space cranial to the diaphragm allowing the operator to easily perform this component of the e-FAST exam as a logical extension of the conventional FAST exam1,28,29 (Video 9).\nLeft upper quadrant (LUQ) window\n\t\nPlace the ultrasound probe in the coronal plane on the patient's left flank along the mid-to-posterior axillary line in the 5th to 7th intracoastal space with the probe indicator towards the patient's head1,28(Figure 7).\nAdjust the probe positioning to obtain a view containing the following structures: (1) spleen; (2) diaphragm; and (3) if possible, the spleno-renal interface (Figure 8; Video 10).\nAdjust screen depth so that the spleno-diaphragmatic interface occupies the middle third of the screen (Figure 8; Video 10).\nAdjust gain as indicated in step 6.1.4, but replace liver with spleen in the instructions (Figure 8; Video 10). Click on Acquire.\nFan through the interface between the spleen and diaphragm anteriorly to posteriorly and back during the video acquisition (Video 11).\nInspect the interface for a hypoechoic or anechoic stripe between the spleen and diaphragm and between the spleen and left kidney (Figure 8; Video 12).\nIf the spleno-renal interface was inadequately visualized in steps 6.2.5-6.2.7, slide (translate) the probe caudally until the spleno-renal interface is visualized and repeat steps 6.2.5-6.2.7 but this time focusing on the spleno-renal rather than the spleno-diaphragmatic interface (Video 13).\nTo examine the left pleural space (i.e., if performing an e-FAST exam), slide (translate) the probe cranially until the view is centered on the diaphragm1,28 (Video 14).\nSuprapubic (pelvic) window",
    "NOTE: Since a fluid-filled bladder provides an excellent medium for the transmission of ultrasound waves, imaging the pelvis before insertion of a foley catheter or clamping the foley catheter to allow filling of the bladder can improve image acquisition1,28.\n\t\nTransverse suprapubic (pelvic) view\n\t\t\nPosition the ultrasound probe in the transverse plane with the indicator mark pointing to the patient's right side, place the probe just cranial to the pubic symphysis, and angle the ultrasound beam 10-20 degrees caudally into the pelvis1,28 (Figure 9).\nAdjust the probe positioning to obtain a view containing the following sex-specific structures.\nIf the patient is female:\n\t\t\t\nAdjust the probe to visualize the following structures: (1) the bladder in its maximal dimension; (2) the uterus (if present); and (3) the space just posterior to the uterus (rectouterine pouch of Douglas)2 (Figure 10).\nAdjust screen depth so that the uterus occupies the middle third of the screen (Figure 10; Video 15).\nAdjust screen gain so that the urine in the bladder appears relatively anechoic (black) and the space deep into the bladder is distinct from the posterior bladder wall (Figure 10; Video 15).\nIf the patient is male:\n\t\t\t\nAdjust the probe to visualize the following structures: (1) the bladder in its maximal dimension and (2) the space just posterior to the bladder (recto-vesical pouch)2 (Figure 11; Video 16).\nAdjust screen depth so that the bladder occupies the middle third of the screen (Figure 11; Video 16).\nAdjust the screen gain so that the urine in the bladder appears relatively anechoic (black) and the space deep into the bladder is distinct from the posterior bladder wall (Figure 11; Video 16).\nClick on Acquire. Fan across the pelvis posteriorly to anteriorly during the video acquisition (Video 17).",
    "Inspect the view for an anechoic stripe in the peri-uterine/rectouterine space if the patient is female (Figure 10B; Video 18) and in the recto-vesical space if the patient is male (Figure 11B; Video 19).\nSagittal suprapubic (pelvic) view\n\t\t\nStarting with the transverse view above (6.3.1.1), rotate the ultrasound probe 90 degrees clockwise until the ultrasound beam is in the sagittal plane with the indicator mark pointing to the patient's head and keep the ultrasound beam angled 10-20 degrees caudally into the pelvis1,28 (Figure 12).\nAdjust the probe positioning to obtain a view containing the following sex-specific structures.\nIf the patient is female:\n\t\t\t\nAdjust the probe to visualize the following structures: (1) the bladder in its maximal dimension; (2) the uterus (if present); and (3) the space just posterior to the uterus (rectouterine pouch of Douglas)2 (Figure 13; Video 20).\nAdjust screen depth so that the uterus occupies the middle third of the screen (Figure 13; Video 20).\nAdjust screen gain so that the urine in the bladder appears relatively anechoic (black) and the space deep to the bladder is distinct from the posterior bladder wall (Figure 13; Video 20).\nIf the patient is male:\n\t\t\t\nAdjust the probe to visualize the following structures: (1) the bladder in its maximal dimension and (2) the space just posterior to the bladder (recto-vesical pouch)2 (Figure 14; Video 21).\nAdjust screen depth so that the bladder occupies the middle third of the screen (Figure 14; Video 21).\nAdjust the screen gain so that the urine in the bladder appears relatively anechoic (black) and the space deep into the bladder is distinct from the posterior bladder wall (Figure 14; Video 21).\nClick on Acquire. Fan across the pelvis left-to-right and back during the video acquisition (Video 22).",
