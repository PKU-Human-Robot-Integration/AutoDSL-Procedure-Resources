Typically, we will use negative-stain EM to assess the quality of nanodisc reconstituted TRPV1. A typical protein preparation from around 300 mL of cell culture produces 0.5–2 mg of purified and nanodisc reconstituted TRPV1 protein that can be divided into multiple aliquots for separate rounds of cryo-EM grid preparation, either to optimize conditions for freezing cryo-EM grids or for preparing complexes with different ligands or other factors. Such additives were usually mixed with aliquoted proteins prior to depositing on cryo-EM grids.\nIncubate nanodisc reconstituted TRPV1 in buffer A with DkTx at the molar ratio of 1:3.5 and the final concentration of DkTx at 20 μM for 20–30 min at ∼24°C. This sample is referred to as TRPV1-DkTx.\nNote: It is known that two DkTx molecules bind to one tetrameric TRPV1 protein.\nIncubate nanodisc reconstituted tetrameric TRPV1 in buffer B with RTX at a final concentration of 40–55 μM (molar ratio of 1:6.9–9.5) supplemented with QX-314 and NMDG at ∼24°C.\nNote: The final concentration of QX-314 and NMDG was 28 mM and 23 mM, respectively.\nNote: This sample is referred to as TRPV1-RTX/NMDG.\nNote: Each tetrameric TRPV1 protein has four binding sites for the agonist RTX. RTX reportedly activates wild-type rat TRPV1 with an EC50 of ∼75 pM (Johnson et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Permeation by QX-314 or NMDG by activated TRPV1 has been described previously (Jara-Oseguera et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).",
    "Incubate nanodisc reconstituted TRPV1 in buffer C with RTX at final concentration of 40–55 μM (molar ratio of 1:6.9–9.5) supplemented with QX-314 at ∼24°C. The final concentration of QX-314 and Na+ was 25 mM and 9 mM, respectively. This sample is referred to as TRPV1-RTX/lowSodium.\nNote: We purposely used a low concentration of Na+ in the final buffer recipe to favor permeation by the large organic cation QX-314.\nCritical: Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles or always use freshly prepared protein/peptide. In the case of TRPV1, aliquotes with only one freeze-thaw cycle behaved similarly to freshly prepared samples. We suggest that, prior to preparation of complexes, the Vitrobot Mark IV is made ready for use, including preparation of liquid ethane and glow-discharged grids, filter paper replacement, filling of humidifier, etc.\nCryo-EM grid preparation\nTiming: 1–3 h\nThese steps describe preparation of the Vitrobot Mark IV and grids for freezing in preparation for loading into microscopes.\nTurn on the Vitrobot by switching button at the back of instrument and wait until Main User interface becomes operational.\nFill the humidifier with distilled water and mount it by following the standard instructions.\nNote: Be careful to mount and remove the humidifier. Make sure that the sealing O-ring is on the top of humidifier. Empirically, 30 mL of water should be enough for filling.\nSet chamber temperature to 20°C. Increase humidity to 100% and turn on device. Ideally, equilibrate the chamber and Vitrobot for approximately 30 min.\nOptional: Temperature and humidity settings may vary in specific cases, such as when working on thermo-sensitive samples.\nInstall new blot papers (Whatman no. 1) on the pad pair a few minutes before first freezing the first grid. Make sure the sharp tip of the Vitrobot tweezer (Ted Pella) works well before using it to handle grids.",
    "Note: The effectiveness of blotting filter papers decreases after extended exposure to high humility. Furthermore, each blotting paper is usually good for only 8 blotting. Thus, the blotting filter paper should be replaced accordingly to prevent contamination and wetting in high humility.\nAssemble and cool the cryogen container by filling the reservoir with liquid nitrogen (LN) and placing a small amount in the copper cup.\nPlace 4-slot grid box(es) into the metal stand supporting up to 4 grid boxes.\nAllow LN in the reservoir to equilibrate and wait until LN in the copper cup stops bubbling.\nFill the copper cup with ethane gas (Airgas company) slowly.\nNote: Ethane gas liquifies when encountering cold copper cub and clear liquid ethane accumulates in the copper cub.\nTurn off ethane gas when the copper cup is full of liquid ethane.\nRemove the metal spider when ethane begins turning from clear to white.\nCritical: Ethane is flammable and may form an explosive gas. Thus, keep it away from heat and fire. When disposing of liquid ethane, pour it into a large quantity of liquid nitrogen slowly. Rapid pouring of liquid ethane may cause splashing (with a loud bang). Liquid ethane causes burning pain on contact with skin. Always wear eye protection and prop PPE when handling liquid ethane!\nNote: This course for cooling the cryogen apparatus is also available at this link: https://emcore.ucsf.edu/content/vitrobot-markiv-notes[href=https://emcore.ucsf.edu/content/vitrobot-markiv-notes].\nTransfer gold grids covered with holey carbon film (Quantifoil, 300 mesh 1.2/1.3) from storage box to grid holder with holey carbon side facing up.\nGently place the loaded grid holder onto the sample table of PELCO easiGLOW equipment (Ted Pella).\nPut the bell jar back on the seal correctly.\nOn the screen, adjust the settings to 30 s at 30 mA and press “AUTO RUN” to start the process.",
    "Wait until the process finishes normally and check to see if the vented system goes back to atmospheric pressure.\nCarefully remove the grid holder and save in a clean petri dish.\nNote: We use a glass slide as grid holder for glow discharge. Detailed information, including program modification, can be found at https://emcore.ucsf.edu/content/easiglow-protocol[href=https://emcore.ucsf.edu/content/easiglow-protocol].\nOptional: The glow-discharge setting may be optimized for different samples.\nPick up one glow-discharged grid with the Vitrobot tweezer and properly mount it to the metal rod.\nOperate Vitrobot to lift ethane container and move tweezer to lower position in the chamber.\nCarefully apply 3 μL of sample solution onto the holey-carbon side.\nBlotting is done with force set to 2 and time for 3.5 s, followed by automatic plunge freezing.\nNote: This blotting force and time generally works well for our samples. For different samples, one may need to optimize the settings to find optimal condition for vitreous ice, which is often necessary when working with new samples.\nPlace the frozen grid into the grid box in the cryogen reservoir. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: With practice, grid transfer will occur smoothly and without bending the grid. The grid should be submerged in liquid nitrogen to prevent crystallization or melting of vitreous ice.\nRepeat steps 10–14 to freeze more grids if needed.\nNote: Typical grid boxes have 4 slots, one for each cryo-grid. Make sure to mark these slots in advance so that the freezing condition of each grid can be recorded properly.\nTransfer the frozen grids into a storage dewar filled with LN for subsequent grid screening and data collection.\nNote: Make sure that the storage dewar is always filled with sufficient LN.\nPause point: The grids are generally frozen ahead of microscope time. The time lag may vary between grid freezing and data collection.\nCryo-data collection",
    "Timing: 1–3 days\nThe steps in this section are designed for screening grid quality and acquiring images for data processing. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCool the transfer station, assembly tools, and autoloader cassette in LN.\nCarefully clip each grid with a clip ring and C-clip and transfer to pre-cooled autoloader cassette.\nNote: More information about grid clipping can be found at https://cryo-em-course.caltech.edu/[href=https://cryo-em-course.caltech.edu/].\nProperly insert well-clipped grids into cassette and load into the autoloader of the microscope (Titan Krios).\nNote: Wait until the inventory updates and the microscope is ready for grid screening.\nThrough the software SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), screen the loaded grids individually and mark the qualified grids for subsequent data acquisition, including particle dispersion and ice thickness.\nAlternatives: The software EPU can also be used for data collection.\nOptional: For each stage movement, we typically collect images from 9 holes by using image shift coupled with beam tilt. With fringe-free illumination (Weis and Hagen, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) setup, we collect 3 or 4 images per hole. Following this strategy, more than 5,000 movie stacks can be recorded per day.\nNote: All datasets were obtained in the super-resolution mode, including samples of TRPV1-DkTx, TRPV1-RTX/NMDG and TRPV1-RTX (low Sodium). The raw movies were saved in compressed tiff format after subtraction with dark reference. Detailed information is provided in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nImage processing\nTiming: Variable from a few days to weeks\nThe steps in this section are aimed at obtaining 3D reconstructions of protein samples through data processing. There are multiple programs available such as Relion, cisTEM, and cryoSPARC.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2045_4.csv\nThe first step in image processing is to correct beam induced image motion.",
    "Note: We use MotionCor2 (Zheng et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]) to perform on-the-fly motion correction through the software Scipion (de la Rosa-Trevin et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) once an image is collected as a movie stack. Normally, all motion corrected images are ready for further processing soon after data acquisition is completed.\nOptional: Motion correction can also be performed after data acquisition and/or using similar algorithms implemented in other programs, such as cryoSPARC or Relion.\nNote: The common parameters needed for all image processing pipelines include pixel size, accelerating voltage, spherical aberration, and total exposure dose. Further introduction to the use of cryoSPARC can be found at https://guide.cryosparc.com/[href=https://guide.cryosparc.com/].\nThe next step is to determine defocus or contrast transfer function (CTF) of each image.\nMotion corrected images in MRC format are imported to cryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nSelect “Patch CTF Estimation (multi)” in the Job Builder and add imported micrographs as input.\nNote: Make sure the amplitude contrast and other default values are pertinent.\nOptional: CTF estimation can be performed using GCTF or other software.\nManually assess micrograph quality by enabling “Manually Curate Exposures” in the Job Builder and rejecting inferior micrographs based on CTF estimation results.\nNote: The criterion for rejection is subjective. We keep the micrographs for further analysis by setting a threshold for the CTF fitting up to a certain resolution (e.g., 6 Å) at highest frequency.\nClone the job created at step 23 and drag and drop the accepted micrographs from last step as input. Randomly select 100 micrographs and submit the job.\nNote: This set of micrographs will be used for blob picking of particles and 2D templates selection.\nOptional: 100 micrographs can be randomly selected using “Exposure Sets job.”",
    "Measure the size of the protein particles at different views and examine a range of minimum and maximum particle diameters in the job “Blob picker”. Monitor the Blob picking and complete the job with optimal parameters.\nNote: e2display.py in EMAN2 package can be used for diameter measurement.\nExtract the particles by using the proper box size and cropping with 4 times at Fourier space.\nNote: Down-scaling particle stacks is one option to speed up data processing. Recommendations regarding box size can be found at https://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2/BoxSize[href=https://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2/BoxSize].\nMove to “2D classification” in Job Builder with extracted particles as input. Set “Number of 2D classes”, between 20 and 50 depending on the number of extracted particles in the stack.\nOnce 2D classification job finishes, execute “Select 2D” job to select the representative 2D projections for template creation.\nOptional: 2D projections for template-based picking can also be created from atomic structure if any similar structure is available in the PDB database.\nDrag and drop the selected micrographs at step 23 and 2D templates from representative 2D averages at step 28 into the active “Template picker” job with proper particle diameter set.\nOptional: Apart from Blob picker and Template picker, it is worthy trying “Deep Picker” powered by network training in some tricky cases.\nWait until completion of particles picking on all gratified micrographs from step 29, and repeat steps 26 and 27 to perform particles extraction and 2D classification.\nSubmit “Select 2D″ job to retain the particles from acceptable classes. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: In general, during 2D classification, we only discard particles from classes that are obviously junk. Further clean-up is performed in the following 3D classification. This helps to preserve particles of different conformations.",
    "The selected particles are further analyzed with 3D classification in cryoSPARC. The “Ab-initio Reconstruction” job is used to generate multiple references, followed by “Heterogenous Refinement” job.\nNote: To speed up the process for large dataset, one can either interrupt the “Ab-initio Reconstruction” process, once a satisfactory result is obtained, or limit the number of particles per classes (such as 10,000 particles per class). The particles selection at step 31 can be tightened up to generate reasonable references using high-scored particles. This 3D classification step should roughly discriminate between good classes and junk classes without consideration of high-resolution information.\nSave the particles within good classes and convert the cryoSPARC-derived cs file to the star file, which can be recognized by the software Relion (Scheres, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Zivanov et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nNote: The file conversion between cs and star files was performed using the command csparc2star.py in the package UCSF pyem (https://zenodo.org/record/3576630[href=https://zenodo.org/record/3576630]). Make sure to enable the argument “--swapxy”.\nRun the “Particle extraction” job to extract the particles using the coordinates file generated by cryoSPARC.\nNote: Depending on the number of particles in the dataset, it is worth downscaling the particle stacks by a factor of 2 for subsequent reconstructions to speed up data processing, as we did in our data sets.\nThe extracted particles were subjected to the “3D classification” job in Relion (classes: 9; iterations: 35) with imposing C4 symmetry and using the 3D reconstruction from cryoSPARC as the initial reference.\nNote: If the reconstructed maps are available from the same protein or other members of the same family, then they can technically be used as initial references.\nLaunch the ‘‘Subset selection’’ job to prepare the star files of each class with reasonable protein features or combined classes with the same conformation after 3D classification separately.",
    "These star files were used for particle extraction at the original pixel level. Another round of 3D classification with imposing C4 symmetry was performed per class to further clean up the particles and identify sub-states.\nThe steps described above cover routine procedures in determining structures of a tetrameric ion channel. In the following, we describe procedures specific to isolating various intermediate states via symmetry expansion and/or focused classification. A flowchart illustrating these procedures is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2045-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A flow chart illustrating the procedure of using symmetry expansion and focused classification to identify stoichiometry of RTX binding to TRPV1\nThis procedure was applied to the TRPV1 RTX/lowSodium sample and allowing capturing of different intermediate binding states of RTX in tetrameric TRPV1.\nTo better identify heterogeneity among each subunit of a particle, we performed symmetry expansion using the command “relion_particle_symmetry_expand” in Relion. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: During symmetry expansion, each particle is assigned four different sets of Euler angles so that each assignment rotates the particle by 90° around the C4 symmetry axis. Thus, the total number of particles in the dataset was quadrupled.\nThe quadrupled particle stacks were subjected to local refinement and focused classification using a 3D mask around the region of interest without imposing symmetry (Regularization parameter T=20; skip-align). Again, particles of poor classes were removed.\nTo further classify different binding modes of DkTx, stoichiometric binding of RTX, or NMDG-induced dilation of the selectivity filter, we performed another round of focused 3D classification with the respective mask focusing on the targeted region.\nNote: For DkTx-containing samples, the mask covered DkTx density in the outer pore region of the symmetry expanded tetramer.\nNote: For TRPV1-RTX/NMDG sample, the mask covered the pore region of the symmetry expanded tetramer.",
    "Note: For the TRPV1 RTX/low-sodium sample, the mask covered the vanilloid binding pocket.\nNote: This focused classification of symmetry expanded particles revealed multiple substates in each sample. This procedure is also described in the Graphical abstract.\nNote: The regularization parameter needs be optimized depending on the masked local regions. These focus masks were created by generating the focused maps in Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and running the job “Mask creation” in Relion (extend binary map: 6 pixels; add a soft-edge: 5 pixels).\nFor the TRPV1-DkTx sample, we removed particles of poor classes after the focused classification. The remaining particles were subjected to another round of 3D classification (T=20; skip-align) without applying a focused mask and symmetry. Classes of the intact particles with different orientations of DkTx were separated during this step. For each original particle, the orientational parameter of only one expansion belonging to the same DkTx bound class was retained and used to calculate a final reconstruction.\nFor the TRPV1-RTX/NMDG sample, we tested multiple classification parameters, including different reference maps, initial low-pass filter, number of classes, and Regularization parameter T, for the focused 3D classification described above and selected the best classes. Any particles classified into more than one class were removed to ensure that all classes contain unique particles, with the rationale that any particle classified into more than one classes is ambiguous and thus removed from further processing. This procedure produced three final 3D reconstructions in different intermediate states.",
    "For the TRPV1 RTX/lowSodium sample, three classes of expanded particles were characterized during 3D classification, including intact phosphatidylinositol lipid (PI), perturbed PI, or RTX in the vanilloid pocket. Based on the star files for each class, which contains information of which original particle each expanded particle belongs to, we traced each symmetry expanded particle back to its original particle, grouped all particles with the same RTX binding stoichiometry, and calculated final 3D reconstructions with specific RTX binding stoichiometry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nParticles from the different states in each sample were subjected to a further auto-refinement job “Refine3D” with local search in Relion (Initial angular sampling: 1.8; Local searches from auto-sample: 1.8).\n“Post-processing” jobs for each reconstruction were conducted to obtain sharpened maps.\nNote: The nominal resolution was estimated from the averaged FSC using FSC = 0.143 criterion by calculating Directional Fourier Shell Correlation (dFSC) curves."
