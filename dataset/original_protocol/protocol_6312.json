    "Preparation of A. thaliana plants and C. higginsianum cultureCulture fungal strains on potato dextrose agar at 24 °C under 12-h black-light blue fluorescent bulb light/12-h dark conditions for 1 week (Figure 1A).Set up at least 8 replicate A. thaliana plants for each genotype to be tested in airtight transparent plastic containers with about 1 cm of water (Figure 1B).Note: The lid of this transparent plastic container should have a rubber seal to maintain 100% humidity conditions during infection. Mark 3 petioles of fully expanded leaves per plant using a permanent marker (Figure 1C).Note: We recommend completing all the steps given above before starting to prepare conidia suspensions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191114/20191114173407_6968.jpgFigure 1. Preparation of A. thaliana plants and C. higginsianum culture. A. 7-day-old culture of C. higginsianum MAFF 305635 on potato dextrose agar incubated at 24 °C under 12-h black-light blue fluorescent bulb light/12-h dark conditions. B. Airtight transparent plastic container with A. thaliana plants. C. Marked petioles using a permanent marker (White arrows).Inoculation with C. higginsianum Place an autoclaved filter funnel in a 50 ml conical tube and fix a folded piece of nylon mesh to the funnel using a piece of surgical tape (Figure 2A).Add 10 ml of room temperature sterilized water to the fungal culture in a Petri dish and gently scrape the surface using an autoclaved painting brush to release conidia (Figure 2B).Pour the conidial suspension through the nylon mesh in the funnel to separate mycelia from conidia (Figure 2C).Note: Conidia should pass through the nylon mesh, but mycelia should not. After centrifugation at 4,500 x g for 5 min at room temperature, remove the supernatant by decanting (Figure 2D).Resuspend the conidial pellet in 2 ml of distilled water.",
    "Prepare a 1/100 diluted conidia suspension in distilled water in an Eppendorf® microcentrifuge tube and determine the concentration of the original suspension using a hemacytometer (Figure 2E).Note: Depending on the conidial concentration, you can prepare different dilution series to obtain ~100 conidia/mm2 on a hemacytometer. Prepare at least 1 ml of 5 x 105 conidia/ml suspension in an Eppendorf® microcentrifuge tube.Open the lid of the transparent plastic container and inoculate 5 μl of the conidia suspension per leaf on the surface of the selected leaves using a pipette (Figure 2F).Note: We recommend inoculating plants where they will be grown during pathotests to minimize the risk of the inoculated conidia suspension running off from the leaf surface during transportation. Spray tap water on the backside of a lid of a transparent plastic container using a spray bottle. Then, seal the lid of the container and carefully place the container in the growth chamber.Note: Do not open the lid until 5 days post-infection to maintain 100% humidity during infection.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191114/20191114173430_2162.jpgFigure 2.

Inoculation of conidia on the leaf surface using a pipette.Preparing images of symptomsSet up a digital camera on a camera stand and set magnification, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.Note: Adjust your camera and exposure settings to minimize shadows and reflections in the images. Make sure to use the same settings for reproducibility when you repeat experiments. For this reason, we also recommend taking photos in a room without windows to avoid the effect of sunshine. Open the lid of the transparent plastic container.",
    "If necessary, gently wipe water droplets on the leaf surface using a paper towel to avoid capturing water-reflected light.Cut the marked petioles, put leaves on a white tray and take photos.Note: The white tray provides a uniform white background for the images. Make sure to include a ruler in images of inoculated leaves."
