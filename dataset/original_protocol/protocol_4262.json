    "Notes: All steps should be performed at 0-4 °C using detergent-free glass-ware or plastic!  We will here describe the isolation of mitochondria from 1 kg of peeled tubers of the cultivar Folva. This will give a final yield of 8-12 mg mitochondrial proteins. Using other cultivars can give different yields. Total time from start of the homogenization (point 3) to freezing about 6 h.  Pre-cool centrifuge rotor.Add cysteine and BSA to extraction buffer, adjust to pH 7.3. Cysteine is an antioxidant and BSA binds fatty acids and phenolics, which can interfere with mitochondrial function, BSA also works as a protease substrate to help protect the mitochondrial proteins from damage.Peel potatoes and homogenize the peeled potato using a juice extractor (1 kg gives approximately 500 ml juice) and let the juice run directly into about 1/2 volume extraction medium (250 ml here). Adjust to pH 7.2 using 2 M KOH immediately afterwards or, for larger preparations, after each kg homogenized.Leave homogenate (total volume about 750 ml) standing for 5 min allowing starch to sediment.Filter through two layers of cotton (or similar) using a funnel and transfer to centrifuge tubes.Transfer ~190 ml filtrate to each of four 250 ml centrifuge tubes. Balance tubes, and centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 5 min in a 6 x 250 ml precooled angle rotor.Pour supernatants carefully into fresh centrifuge tubes (avoid transferring the pellets), balance and centrifuge at 18,000 x g for 10 min.Discard the supernatants gently without disturbing the pellets and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml of 1x mannitol gradient buffer using a paint brush. Total volume of resuspended pellets 8-10 ml.Prepare two Percoll step gradients using plastic Pasteur pipettes.",
    "Avoid mixing the bands by gently layering first the 50%, then the 28% and finally the 20% Percoll (all in mannitol) on top of each other in 50 ml centrifuge tubes. Gently layer the crude fraction (4-5 ml maximum per gradient) on top of the two Percoll step gradients.Balance tubes and centrifuge at 40,000 x g for 30 min using an 8 x 50 ml pre-cooled angle rotor (see Figure 1A).Transfer the mitochondrial band from each tube using a Pasteur pipette to new 50 ml tubes, fill up to 40 ml with wash buffer and mix.Balance the two tubes against each other and centrifuge at 18,000 x g for 10 min.Carefully remove supernatant, resuspend the very loose pellets with wash buffer, fill up to 40 ml with wash buffer and mix.Balance and centrifuge at 18,000 x g for 10 min (see Figure 1B).Remove supernatant and resuspend the very loose pellets using a paint brush in 1 ml 1 x mannitol buffer and gently layer on top of two 28% Percoll sucrose gradients.Balance and centrifuge at 40,000 x g for 30 min using the 8 x 50 ml rotor (see Figure 1C).Transfer the mitochondrial bands to two fresh 50 ml centrifuge tubes, fill up to 40 ml with wash buffer and mix. Centrifuge at 18,000 x g for 10 min.Carefully remove supernatant and repeat wash (as steps 13-14) of pellets (see Figure 1D). Remove supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 500 µl wash buffer. Add 5% (v/v) DMSO for freezing of the intact organelles. The final volume from each pellet is around 800 µl containing 4-6 mg (total 8-12 mg) mitochondrial protein.Snap freeze and store aliquots of 100-200 µl in liquid nitrogen.",
    "In this way, the mitochondria maintain their intactness and respiratory function (see below) for months, if quickly thawed shortly before use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140831/20140831225251_5311.jpgFigure 1. Percoll gradient purification of potato tuber mitochondria. A). Step gradient with a yellowish mitochondrial band at the 28% - 50% Percoll interface and a starch pellet (after step 11). B). The pellet obtained after removing the mitochondrial band from the step gradient and washing it (after step 15). The dark center consists of peroxisomes (Struglics et al., 1993). C). Continuous gradient with a whitish mitochondrial band (after step 17). D). The final pellet obtained after removing the mitochondrial band from the continuous gradient and washing it (after step 20)."
