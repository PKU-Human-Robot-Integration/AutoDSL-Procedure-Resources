    "Plant material preparation (requires 2-4 d after harvesting of tissue)After harvesting approximately 5 g (fresh weight) of desired tissue for lignin content determination, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C for at least 1 h until use.Lyophilize tissue until completely dry; duration of lyophilization often depends on tissue density, but commonly takes at least 24 h and up to 72 h for complete drying. Grind freeze-dried tissue to pass through a 60-mesh screen using a Wiley Mini-Mill. Wiley Mini-Mills are equipped to grind dried samples ranging from long, thin Arabidopsis stems (several mm thick) to thicker woody tissues (~1 cm). Transfer coarsely-ground samples to cryogenic-compatible containers with steel balls (leave 1/3 of the container empty for air space) and mill using a Retsch CryoMill ball mill with a pre-cooling cryo setting at 5 Hz for ~3 min, followed by grinding at 5-10 min at 30 Hz. If the sample is not a homogenously fine powder after this initial grinding, another round of cryogenic milling should be performed. It is essential to obtain a fine powder with high surface area to facilitate the complete digestion of lignin present in the AIR (Figure 1). This tissue will be used to prepare alcohol insoluble residue (AIR). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170227/20170227022150_8573.jpgFigure 1. Representation of insufficiently and sufficiently ground dry plant materialAlcohol insoluble residue (AIR) preparation (requires 2-3 d)Weigh roughly 70 mg of finely ground tissue into a 2 ml Sarstedt tube (see Note 2). Add 1.5 ml of 70% ethanol, vortex thoroughly, centrifuge at ≥ 10,000 x g for 10 min to pellet residue, remove as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet.Wash with 1.5 ml 1:1 chloroform:methanol, vortex to resuspend pellet, then centrifuge and remove supernatant as described in the previous step. Add 1.",
    "5 ml acetone, vortex, and then centrifuge and remove supernatant as previously described. Allow material suspended in residual acetone to air dry in a chemical hood overnight with the tube cap removed, or dry under a stream of air at 35 °C on a Reacti-Therm apparatus until completely dry (see Note 3). The remaining material is AIR. To destarch AIR, add 1.5 ml 90% DMSO to the pellet, vortex thoroughly, and allow to shake overnight on a platform rocker at a speed of at least 50 rpm speed at the highest angle to facilitate mixing. The following day, centrifuge and remove supernatant as previously described (see Note 4). Wash once in 1.5 ml 90% DMSO, vortex, centrifuge, remove supernatant as described above. Wash six times in 1.5 ml 70% ethanol; vortex, then centrifuge and remove supernatant each time as previously described.Add 1.5 ml acetone, vortex, and then centrifuge and remove supernatant as previously described. Allow material suspended in residual acetone to air dry in a chemical hood overnight, or dry under a stream of air at 35 °C on a Reacti-Therm apparatus (see Note 3). The remaining material is de-starched AIR. Verify the absence of starch by staining a small portion of de-starched AIR with Lugol’s Iodine solution and washing with water once. For staining, use at least 2 mg AIR for ease of visualizing stained starch. Add 500 µl Lugol’s Iodine solution to AIR and vortex, incubate at room temperature for 5 min, centrifuge and remove supernatant as previously described, wash with 1 ml water, centrifuge and remove supernatant as previously described, and observe color of AIR. If starch is present, the AIR will appear dark in color and the destarching protocol should be repeated (see Note 5; Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170227/20170227022332_9080.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Image of non-destarched and destarched AIR following staining with Lugol’s Iodine solutionAcetyl bromide soluble lignin determination (requires 1-2 d)Weigh out approximately 5 mg of destarched AIR and put into a 7 ml glass screw-cap vial; record the exact mass. Small aggregates of particulate AIR below ~0.5 mm in diameter will not affect lignin solubilization as small aggregates should be permeable to the 25% acetyl bromide due to cryo-milling and will likely disintegrate during digestion. For each biological sample, perform technical replicates in triplicate. In a chemical hood, prepare 25% acetyl bromide by diluting in glacial acetic acid (see Note 6). Be sure to wear appropriate PPE and use a glass graduated cylinder for measuring and only glass containers for all steps involving acetyl bromide. To each glass tube containing destarched AIR, gently add 1 ml of 25% acetyl bromide, swirl gently to mix AIR into 25% acetyl bromide. Also add 1 ml of 25% acetyl bromide to an empty glass tube, which will serve as a blank. Put all samples at 70 °C for 1 h with gentle swirling every 10 min (see Note 7). Note: If using a water bath to fit the large 7 ml tubes, make sure to use a glass secondary container, such as a tall glass beaker, to prevent the tubes from tipping over.Immediately put samples on ice to cool. While samples are on ice, add 5 ml of glacial acetic acid and vortex thoroughly in the chemical hood.Allow any residual AIR to settle to the bottom of the glass vials for at least 1 h to overnight at room temperature.",
    "The reaction is complete and stable after the addition of glacial acetic acid and the absorbance corresponding to ABSL values will not be significantly affected; waiting for any residue to settle is important because suspended particles may interfere with the accuracy of the spectrophotometer (see Note 8). Once settled, gently transfer 300 µl from the top of each acetyl bromide solution to a quartz cuvette while avoiding resuspending any residual AIR. Add 400 µl 1.5 N NaOH, then 300 µl 0.5 M freshly made hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Pipette solutions gently into the cuvette until fully mixed together after addition of the hydroxylamine hydrochloride (pipette up and down ~15-20 times for thorough mixing, look for complete miscibility of the mixed solutions), and measure absorption at 280 nm against a blank on a spectrophotometer immediately after mixing is complete. The blank consists of the blank acetyl bromide digestion sample mixed with 1.5 N NaOH and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the same ratio as previously described. Due to the utilization of a single quartz cuvette, each sample must be prepared in the cuvette immediately before reading A280. If the A280 measurement exceeds 1.000, it is recommended to dilute the mixture with acetic acid to ensure accurate readings and to best observe the resulting curve for any aberrant characteristics (see Figure 3 for expected spectrum characteristics). Be sure to account for this dilution factor in addition to the other dilutions from the 1 ml digestion during calculation of percentage of acetyl bromide soluble lignin (see Note 9). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170227/20170227022537_2320.jpgFigure 3. Representative absorbance spectrum of ABSL reading measured against a blank. A280 absorbance is due to the presence of ABSL, and A600 is depicted to show that there is minimal residual AIR particulate matter present in the sample during absorbance reading.",
    "Between samples, wash the inside of the cuvette with glacial acetic acid and wipe the outside of the cuvette clean with 70% ethanol. Use Beer’s Law to calculate the percentage of acetyl bromide soluble lignin with the proper extinction coefficient (see Table 1; see Note 10)."
