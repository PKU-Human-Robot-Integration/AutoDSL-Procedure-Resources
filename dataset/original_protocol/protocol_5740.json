    "Radioactive labelling (standard 2-3 days)Culture adherent cells in a 75 cm2 tissue culture flask in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C until a near confluent cell layer has been obtained. Wash once with 3 ml 37 °C PBS and incubate the cells with 3 ml 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C until the cells have detached (typically 3-5 min).Collect the detached cells in 10 ml 37 °C RPMI 1640 supplemented with FBS to 10% final concentration (= Complete Medium, CM).Note: The concentrations of radioactive and cold valine in this protocol have been adapted specifically for use in RPMI 1640, based on the concentration of valine in this medium, and based on cost-efficiency with respect to the amount of radioactive valine used. When following this protocol, cells should therefore be resuspended in RPMI 1640 after trypsinization, even though they are not normally cultured in RPMI 1640. For the same reason, RPMI 1640 should be used for the remainder of the protocol. We have validated this assay in > 20 cell lines and have never observed signs of toxicity or altered phenotypes in cells that are normally not cultured RPMI 1640, as long as the cells do not require any special supplements. Other media can be used instead of RPMI 1640, but users should adjust valine concentrations throughout the protocol to account for differences in the valine concentration of RPMI 1640 versus the alternative medium used.Seed cells in a 24-well plate in 0.5 ml CM supplemented with 14C-valine to a final concentration 0.1 µCi/ml. Seed a cell number that will lead to the desired monolayer confluency at the time of experimental treatment. In general, we seed cells so that they reach 50-80% confluency after 2-3 days incubation in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.",
    "Notes:  The protocol presented here is compatible with a 24-well plate format. Because of the ease of the procedure and its high reproducibility, we routinely process two 24-well plates (48 wells) per experiment with duplicate or triplicate wells per treatment condition. This makes it possible to test a relatively large number of conditions in a single experiment.For LNCaP cells, we seed 1 x 105 cells per well. For U2OS, VCaP and Huh7, we seed 3 x 104, 2.5 x 105, and 1.2 x 104 cells per well, respectively.When working with cell types that adhere poorly (e.g., LNCaP cells, HEK293 cells, and others), it is recommended to use tissue culture plates that have been coated to improve cell adherence (due to multiple wash steps in the protocol). We prefer to use poly-D-lysine (PDL), as it is relatively inexpensive and easy to use, and does not interfere with amino acid starvation (since it, unlike, e.g. poly-L-lysine, is not metabolised by cells). Per well in a 24-well tissue culture plate, add 300 µl sterile PDL (2.5 µg/ml). Incubate the plates in a sterile environment for 30 min at room temperature. Afterwards, remove the PDL using suction, and wash each well briefly with 0.5 ml sterile H2O. The plates are ready for use when dry. PDL-coated plates are stable for up to several weeks when stored at room temperature. Of note, for most cell types coating is not necessary.When doing siRNA transfection, we recommend using reverse transfection so that the cells can be transfected and radiolabelled simultaneously. This is both practical and gives a very high transfection efficiency. Combine Opti-MEM, siRNA, and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and aliquot the transfection mix into a 24-well plate (50 µl per well). Incubate at room temperature for 20-45 min, and seed 0.",
    "5 ml cell suspension in CM containing 14C-valine in the wells containing the siRNA-Lipofectamine mixture. Carefully agitate the plate and place it in the incubator.Follow the rules of your institution with regard to work with radioactivity. For own protection, wear gloves with a thickness of ≥ 0.25 mm.Incubate the cells for 2-3 days in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow ample incorporation of 14C valine into long-lived proteins.Chase (standard 18 h)Aspirate the medium to remove unincorporated radioactivity. Wash cells once with 0.5 ml 37 °C CM supplemented with 10 mM cold valine (CM-V).Note: Since RPMI 1640 contains 0.17 mM L-valine, the final concentration of L-valine in CM-V will be 10.17 mM. The use of 10 mM cold L-valine to block re-incorporation of released 14C-valine is standard for this type of assay (Bauvy et al., 2009; Mizushima et al., 2001; Fuertes et al., 2003a). It is not known whether there is an upper limit of how high concentration of cold L-valine can be used, but in isolated rat hepatocytes it has been shown that up to 20 mM cold L-valine does not affect protein degradation activity (Seglen et al., 1979). Aspirate the medium and replace with 0.5 ml 37 °C CM-V.Incubate the cells for 18 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Notes:  The chase does not need to be 18 h. However, altering the duration of the chase will change the protein degradation rate during the sampling (Figure 2A), as well as the signal intensity during liquid scintillation counting (see Note 2 in the Notes section for comments on scintillation counting and the variability of assay measurements), and will also change the pool of proteins analysed (see Note 3 in the Notes section).",
    "One should keep this in mind when comparing results obtained with different chase durations.If doing experimental treatments longer than 6 h, add your treatments prior to or during the chase. This additionally gives an opportunity to sample treatment effects on LLPD at various time periods after initiation of the treatment. Sampling (standard 2-6 h)Remove released 14C valine (resulting from the degradation of short-lived proteins) by aspirating the medium. Wash cells once with 0.5 ml 37 °C of appropriate medium. If the subsequent treatment will be in complete medium (e.g., Torin1), wash with CM-V. If the subsequent treatment will be in amino acid starvation medium (e.g., EBSS), wash with EBSS supplemented with 10 mM cold valine (EBSS-V). Aspirate the medium and add your treatments in 0.25 ml 37 °C CM-V or EBSS-V.Incubate the cells for 2-6 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.HarvestDay 1 Remove the plate with cells from the incubator and cool it on ice for ~2 min.Add 50 µl ice-cold PBS/2%BSA per well.Note: BSA is added as a protein carrier to facilitate protein precipitation with TCA.Add 200 µl ice-cold 25% TCA per well to precipitate protein.Place the plate on a shaker at 4 °C and let it shake over night at 600 rpm.Note: Whereas overnight TCA precipitation is sufficient, the precipitation may be extended for several days without affecting the results.Day 2Transfer the precipitated protein (~500 µl) from each well to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.Note: Transfer the solution to microcentrifuge tubes without scraping. The protein precipitate remaining in the wells will be solubilised and collected in the protocol Steps D10-D12.Sediment precipitates by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "After the centrifugation, the supernatant (TCA soluble fraction) contains amino acids and small peptides (including 14C valine released from proteins due to degradation during the sampling period) and the pellet (TCA insoluble fraction) contains intact proteins.After the centrifugation, place the tubes on ice.Transfer the supernatant (~500 µl) from each tube into 6 ml scintillation vials.Solubilise the pellet by adding 250 µl 0.2 M KOH per tube and rotating the tubes for at least 1 h at room temperature.Note: It is not necessary to wash the pellet prior to solubilising it in KOH.Solubilise remaining protein precipitate in the 24-well plate by adding 250 µl 0.2 M KOH per well. Rotate on a shaker at 600 rpm for 1 h at room temperature.Merge the solubilised protein from the respective wells and tubes (~500 µl) and transfer to 6 ml scintillation vials. Fill each vial from Steps D8 and D12 with 4 ml scintillation liquid. Cap the tubes, and vortex hard.Note: The scintillation liquid is an organic and toxic substance. For your own protection, add scintillation liquid, cap tubes, and vortex in a flow-cabinet, wearing protective gloves and lab coat.Measure the amount of radioactivity in all of the tubes by liquid scintillation counting (see Note 2 in the separate Notes section for comments on scintillation counting and the variability of assay measurements)."
