    "Examination of germline biotinylated proteins by fluorescent streptavidin staining Suspend 30–60 adult worms in M9 buffer, and transfer them to a low binding microcentrifuge tube.Allow animals to sink to the bottom of the tube, and wash three times with approximately 1 mL of M9 to remove bacteria. Remove M9 between washes by pipetting.Remove supernatant, add 1 volume (approximately 25 μL) of M9 containing 0.5 mM tetramisole and 0.05% Tween 20, and transfer samples to a dissection slide.Under a dissecting microscope, dissect worms by decapitating animals near the pharynx: place two 22 G needles on either side of the head, and move the needles in a scissor-like motion (Day et al., 2020).Transfer dissected animals to a low-binding microcentrifuge tube, using a mouth pipette. Add 6 volumes (~150 μL) of 3.3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBST to the sample, and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.Note: Allow dissected worms to settle to the bottom of the tube by gravity between washes. Centrifugation may damage samples. Remove fixative by pipetting, wash twice with 1 mL of PBS, and add 1 mL of methanol at -20°C. Incubate samples at -20°C for at least 15 min.Remove methanol by pipetting, wash samples twice with 1.5 mL of PBST.While waiting for samples to settle, prepare staining solution in the dark, by making a 1:500 dilution of the streptavidin AF488 stock in PBST.Add 100 μL of staining solution to the samples, and incubate in the dark at 4°C overnight.Note: All remaining steps should be carried out in the dark and sample exposure to light should be minimized. Remove as much staining solution as possible by pipetting. Wash three times with 1.5 mL of PBST for 15 min, then once with 1.5 mL of PBS for 5 min.",
    "Remove as much PBS as possible by pipetting, and add 50 μL of antifade mounting medium with DAPI to each tube.Suspend samples in mounting medium with a glass Pasteur pipette, then transfer ~5 μL of sample to a microscopy slide. Cover sample with a clean coverslip, and seal with nail polish.Image samples using confocal fluorescence microscopy (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4386/bioprotoc-12-08-4386-g001.jpgFigure 1. Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 staining of gonads dissected from wild-type and TurboID::glh-1 animals. Representative maximum intensity projection of z-slices spanning the depth of the gonad in the late pachytene region. Robust perinuclear signals are observed in TurboID::glh-1 gonads, but not in wild-type gonads. DAPI stains DNA. Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 stains biotinylated molecules. Scale bar = 20 μm. Images were acquired using a 60× water immersion objective.Cultivation of TurboID-tagged C. elegans strains Grow 60,000 synchronized L1 larvae on a 150 mm × 15 mm NGM plate seeded with concentrated OP50-1 Escherichia coli (~2 mL) at 20°C.Note: Standard cultivation conditions for C. elegans, recipes for Nematode Growth Media (NGM), and production of concentrated bacteria can be found at wormbook.org. Harvest non-starved gravid worms from plate(s) by pipetting 10 mL of M9 onto the plate, and transferring worm suspension into a 15-mL conical tube.Spin worms down at 800 × g for 1 min, and replace with fresh M9. Re-spin worms down, replace with fresh M9, then gently invert for 10 min, to remove bacteria.Wash once more with M9, then ddH2O, and then RIPA.Resuspend in 2 mL of RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors (4× worm volume).Quick freeze in liquid nitrogen. Samples can be stored at -80°C before proceeding.Homogenization of C. elegans and lysate preparation Thaw samples, and transfer worm suspension to 2-mL screw cap Lysing Matrix D tubes, which contain ceramic spheres.",
    "Grind worms 3–4 times (speed =6, time =45 s), cooling samples on ice for 2 min in between, to avoid overheating. Check lysis efficiency under the dissecting microscope (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4386/bioprotoc-12-08-4386-g002.jpgFigure 2. Homogenization of C. elegans samples. Pre-lysis and post-lysis suspension images were acquired using a 10× objective. After successful homogenization, intact worms are no longer visible and samples become turbid.Quickly spin down in a refrigerated centrifuge. Transfer supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube.Spin twice at 14,000 × g for 8 min. Each time, transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. Avoid contamination with pellet and lipid interface. Typically, 1500 µL of lysate can be recovered.Note: Keep samples on ice to prevent protein degradation. Streptavidin affinity pulldown Save an aliquot of input (20 µL) for the streptavidin blot.Equilibrate streptavidin beads (80 µL per sample) by washing with RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors twice. At each wash, centrifuge the beads at 94 × g for 30 s. Wait 1–2 min to let the beads settle down. Separate beads from wash in a magnetic stand, and remove the supernatant without disturbing the beads.Note: The amount of streptavidin beads can be adjusted, depending on the abundance of biotinylated proteins. Mix the protein lysate with the beads.Incubate with constant rotation (~14 rpm) at 4°C overnight.Separate beads from lysate, by placing samples in a magnetic stand. Remove supernatant. Save an aliquot of flow-through (20 µL) for the streptavidin blot.Wash beads with the following series of buffers to remove nonspecifically bound proteins, each time rotating the samples for 5 min and quickly spinning down at 94 × g, twice with RIPA lysis buffer, once with 1 M KCl, once with 0.1 M Na2CO3, once with 2 M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), twice again with RIPA lysis buffer, and three times with PBS.",
    "Resuspend beads in 50 µL of PBS. Resuspended beads are ready for on-bead digest and mass spectrometry analysis.Save an aliquot of resuspended beads (10 µL) for the streptavidin blot.Streptavidin blotting analysis Elute proteins from resuspended beads using 20 µL of 4× LDS Sample Buffer supplemented with 20 mM DTT and 2 mM biotin. Boil samples at 95°C for 10 min. Vortex briefly and transfer the supernatant (~30 µL) to a fresh tube.Load 5 µL/1,500 µL (0.33%) input, 5 µL/1,500 µL (0.33%) flow-through, and 3.3 µL/50 µL (6.67%) pulldown samples in a 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel, and run the gel according to the manufacturer's instructions.Transfer samples to a PVDF membrane at 20V for 45 min.Incubate the PVDF membrane overnight with Streptavidin-HRP (1:4,000).Develop with Clarity Western ECL substrates (1:1) for 5 min.Note: The membrane can be stained with Coomassie blue dyes for the loading control. If streptavidin affinity pulldown is successful, biotinylated proteins should be depleted in the flow-through fraction, and enriched in the bound fraction (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4386/bioprotoc-12-08-4386-g003.jpgFigure 3. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase blotting. Biotinylated proteins are present in the input, depleted in the flow-through and enriched in the pulldown fraction prepared from wild-type C. elegans and a strain expressing TurboID::GLH-1. An asterisk marks the endogenously biotinylated mitochondrial protein PCCA-1."
