    "The protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Chronic orchialgia patients who failed conservative treatment were admitted and signed informed consent.\n1. Instruments for operation\nEnsure the availability of the surgical microscope and microvascular doppler.\n2. Preparation for operation\nClean and shave the inguinal/subinguinal skin and scrotum before surgery.\n\tNOTE: Before surgery, the surgical site need not be sterilized. As a routine procedure, soap is used to clean the inguinal/subinguinal skin and scrotum, and then a razor is used for shaving the area.\nLet the patient lie on the operating table in a supine position after combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: The anesthetist performs anesthetization. The anesthetization agents are mainly routine, while sometimes personalized. The choice and the dose of the anesthetic agent used are made by the anesthetist.\n3. Procedure\nExpose and lift the spermatic cord out of the incision.\n\t\nPerform a 2 cm oblique skin incision below the external inguinal ring with a circular scalpel.\nThen, dissect the spermatic cord and deliver it through the incision with the help of appendix forceps (see Figure 1).\nMicrosurgical varicocelectomy\n\t\nBring an operating microscope into the operating field, and examine the cord under 8–12x power magnification.\nUse an electric knife to cut the external fascia and cremasteric fibers about 1 cm. Bluntly separate the internal spermatic fascia with its structures from the vas deferens and its vessels by a loop. Ligate the external spermatic vessels with 4-0 silk sutures.",
    "Drip 1% lidocaine solution on the spermatic cord. Use an intra-operative vascular Doppler flow detector (see Figure 2) to localize the internal spermatic arteries (pulse “whistle” sound can be heard when the microvascular doppler probes the arterial surface while there is no sound on the veins).\nDoubly ligate all of the internal spermatic veins with 4-0 silk ties and divide them. Accurately separate and preserve all identified arteries and lymphatics by loops (see Figure 3). Use microvascular doppler to distinguish arteries from veins when necessary.\nMicrosurgical denervation (see Figure 4)\n\t\nNext, carefully divide the anterior cremasteric muscle. Cut off the fatty and connective tissues surrounding the spermatic cord blood vessels and vas deferens completely with an electric knife. Identify and preserve the vas deferens and its associated vessels.\nLigate and divide the vasal veins attached to the vas deferens when the vessels enlarge. Divide the posterior cremasteric fibers and fat components.\nFinish the operation\n\t\nSkeletonize (only the testicular arteries, lymphatic vessels, and vas deferens remained after the surgery) the spermatic cord completely. Use the microvascular doppler to examine the testicular arteries again (see Figure 5).\nThen, manually place the cord back into the incision. Suture the deep tissue and skin.\nSubscription Required.
