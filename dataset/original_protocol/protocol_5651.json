    "Dye application Notes:   No sterile techniques are required for this protocol.   Wear gloves and mask during the entire procedure.   Prepare in advance a fresh hair discoloration preparation:   Considering that it has an unpleasant and strong smell, you might consider using a hood.   Fill at least one PCR tube with bleaching powder and the hydrogen peroxide, close the tube and mix it.   A viscous preparation must be obtained to avoid it dripping off the whisker.     Prepare in advance cotton pads (or gauzes) soaked in distilled water and vinegar.   Wear protective goggles before switching the excitation source on.   Before starting this protocol, the rat should be sedated (see Procedure B: ‘Animal sedation’: follow the ‘pre-anesthesia’ and ‘anesthesia’ procedures).   Place the rat on the heating pad and set the body temperature to 37 °C.   Put the Epigel on the rat’s eyes to protect them from light and dryness.   Apply the discoloration preparation (Figure 1A) on all whiskers using cotton swabs. Since its smell is quite strong, avoid placing it close to the rat’s nose, because breathing it can reverse the effect of Domitor.   Wait between 30 min and 1 h to bleach whiskers.   Rinse the whiskers using distilled water with a cotton pad (Figure 1B).   Dry the whiskers with air-flow or a cotton pad (Figure 1C).   Place the rat’s head under illumination and tilt it a bit to reach the whisker(s) you are interested in.   Isolate selected whiskers (Figure 1D)   Cut a piece of Parafilm to cover the rat’s snout and cheeks (e.g., 6 cm L x 6 cm H).   Make a small hole to let the whisker pass through. You can use a glass capillary or a tweezer to isolate the whisker, in both cases paying attention not to damage the whisker or the rat’s skin.",
    "The resulting working surface allows application of the dye(s) only on a selected subset of whiskers. This is very important in order to prevent the unwanted application of the dye.     Flatten the working surface at the base of the selected whisker(s) to allow the application of the dye on the complete whisker(s) length.   Apply the fluorescent dye on whisker(s) (Figure 1E). For each whisker:   Cut a piece of Parafilm of circa 2 cm width and slightly longer than the whisker.   Fill the syringe with the fluorescent dye and eject it abundantly onto the Parafilm in order to soak the whisker along its entire length. In order to avoid air bubbles, which would locally prevent staining, spread the dye with a cotton swab.   The whisker now adheres weakly to the Parafilm because soaked in a gel. Any movement can make the whisker slip away. It will be helpful to hold the Paraffin film or even tighten it with aluminum foil.     Wait between 30 min and 1 h from the last application to let the dye diffuse inside the cuticle.   Remove the excessive dye and rinse the whisker(s) using a cotton pad or a gauze wet with vinegar, which tends to close the cuticle in complete safety for the animal. Notes:   Clean one whisker at a time. Use a different cotton pad (or gauze) for each whisker in order to not mix the color).   Since the vinegar smell is quite strong, avoid placing it close to the rat’s nose, because breathing it can reverse the effect of Domitor.     Visualization test (Figure 1F): wear the protective glasses, turn off all the room lights and turn on the lamp.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227013739_8738.png Figure 1.

    "Isolation of a single whisker with paraffin film; E. Application of the dye; F. Visualization test. This figure was adapted using images from Supplementary Figure 1 of Rigosa et al., 2017.    Set the shutter speed of the high speed camera according to experimenter’s needs. Note: The higher the shutter speed, the shorter the exposure time, the darker the grabbed image. Choose the highest exposure time possible for brightest images.   Simulate experimental conditions placing the animal in a box covered with neoprene and installing the lamp at the proper distance upon experimenter’s needs. Note: Light conditions and reflections strongly depend on the neoprene and lamp installation.   Visualize the whisker(s) and adjust the camera gain (Figures 2 and 3). Note: If the background is much darker than the visualized whisker, the gain of the camera sensor can be safely increased without introducing salt and pepper noise to the image. This feature depends on the specific camera model.     Follow the guidelines for Post-anesthesia (see Procedure B: ‘Animal sedation’) to recover the rat.   In case the visualization is not sufficient (e.g., the whisker did not absorb the dye along its entire length), plan another application of the dye. In case the time left before the current sedation ends is not sufficient for immediate re-staining, ask your veterinarian when another sedation for the same animal could be feasible.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227013906_8346.jpg Figure 2. High-speed video setup. A cage equipped with a licking sensor is used to trigger and synchronize the high-speed video recording with the licking behavior. The field of view is illuminated using the custom made lamp and the optical path to the camera sensor was filtered using an orange transparent plexiglass.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227013934_9777.png Figure 3.

    "A behaving rat is illuminated using 4 LEDs of the lamp and an orange plexiglass plate as an optical filter. The video was shot at 1,000 frames per second. This figure was adapted using images from Supplementary Figure 3 of Rigosa et al., 2017.      Animal sedation Notes:   This protocol was performed without sterile techniques.   Inform yourself about the features of Domitor: time of effect, site of injection, which reflexes are suppressed and time of recovery.   Set ambient temperature to the room temperature (25 °C) and keep it constant.   Wear gloves and mask during the entire procedure.   The sedation should last between 2.5 and 3 h.   Between two sedations the rat needs 24 h of recovery.   Avoid more than two sedations a week.   Do not obstruct the animal breathing with anything while it is sedated.   Do not disturb the animal sedation with strong odors (e.g., by approaching the discoloration preparation or the vinegar).    Pre-anesthesia procedure   Make sure that the rat drank water in the last 5 h.   Make sure that the rat is housed alone in the cage.   Bring the rat to a silent and quiet place with constant room temperature.   Weigh the rat and calculate the dose for the anesthetic; the dose of Domitor (Medetomidine hydrochloride) is 0.5 mg/kg [1 mg/ml] intraperitoneal (IP).   Prepare the anesthetic in the syringe, ready to be injected.    Anesthesia procedure   From now on, the procedure should be as fast as possible to reduce the risk of stressing the animal.   Make the IP injection:   Restrain the animal, expose the abdomen and inject in the lower right quadrant to avoid inner organs. Note: In alternative, grasp the rat by the tail and raise its belly, with its posterior legs lifted, inner organs will move towards the head, reducing the risk of missing the target of the shot.",
    "Don’t keep the animal in the restrained position for a long time; it is unnatural and stressful.   Inject the anesthetic IP in a single shot.     Place the rat in the cage   Use a heating pad or cover the rat body with a tissue or aluminum foil to diminish heat dissipation.   Place the cage in a dark room.     After 10 min test the reflexes (tail, hind paw, corneal).   If the animal is sedated, apply the dye.   During sedation, constantly monitor the heart beating and the breathing rate.    Post-anesthesia procedure   Put the rat back in the cage.   Prepare the dose of the Antisedan (Atipamezole hydrochloride), standard dose for IP injection is 0.2 ml.   Make the IP injection.   Cover the rat with a tissue to keep its body temperature at 37 °C until it wakes up."
