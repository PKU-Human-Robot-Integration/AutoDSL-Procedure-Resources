    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the University College London's human research ethics committee.\nCAUTION: This protocol contains an electrical hazard and a burn hazard (soldering iron); read both before attempting this protocol. This protocol includes connecting a device to skin. Ensure that at no time there is a path between the skin and electricity mains. Never touch the element of the soldering iron. Hold wires to be heated with tweezers or clamps. Keep the cleaning sponge wet during use. Always return the soldering iron to its stand when not in use. Never put it down on the workbench. Turn unit off and unplug it when not in use.\n1. Assembling the Base Components\nNOTE: Figure 3 gives a high-level overview of the protocol steps.\nTo build the Bionic Clicker MK I, plug the bio-signals sensor shield into the microcontroller and screw the EMG cables into the E, M and GND screw terminals of the shield (see Figure 4). Continue to step 1.6.\nTo build the MK II, place a row of three header pins into the muscle sensor in the +, - and SIG holes (see Figure 5) from above, and solder underneath.\nBend the header pins 90 ° with a pair of plyers halfway up the pins. This places the pins in the correct position for the case.\nIf using the abductor indicis muscle as the input, continue to step 1.3, if not move to step 1.4.\nRemove the short black reference cable from the muscle sensor.\nCut the three EMG cables with a wire cutter to run from the wrist to the back of the hand. Strip the end of the three EMG cables with a wire stripper.",
    "Place the stripped end of the black wire into the R hole, the blue wire into the E hole, and the red wire into the M hole of the muscle sensor (Figure 5). Solder the wires in place on the underside of the muscle sensor. Move to step 1.5.\nClip two electrode pads into the underside of the muscle sensor and one electrode into the connector of the black reference cable.\nStick the muscle sensor onto the selected muscle with the electrode pads and place the black reference electrode in an appropriate place.\nCut 8 single-core multi-thread wires to length and strip each end: 5 short (7 cm) wires to run from the microcontroller to the control board (red, black, green, white and blue) and 3 longer (approximately 12 cm but dependent on wrist size) wires (red, black and green) to run from one side of the wrist to the other.\n\tNOTE: If placing the muscle sensor on a different muscle make sure that the longer wires will run from the muscle sensor site to the wireless microcontroller site.\n\t\nPlace the wires into the microcontroller ready for soldering: 2 red wires into the 3V hole, 2 black wires into the GND hole, the long green wire into the A0 hole, the short blue wire into the 2 hole, the long white wire into the 3 hole, and the short green wire into the 5 hole. Solder the wires in place on the underside of the microcontroller.\nSolder the other end of the 3 long wires to 3 header sockets in the order: red, black, green. See Figure 5. If not using the abductor indicis muscle proceed on to step 2.",
    "Place the EMG sensor pads on the hand, as shown in Figure 6, with two of the electrodes at either end of the abductor indicis muscle and one EMG sensor pad on the middle of the back of the hand.\nClip the electrode pads into the connector end of the muscle sensor cables (push fit). The blue and red electrodes clip above the muscle, the black electrode clips on the back of the hand.\n2. Test EMG Output\nDownload the library for the bio-signals shield following the link14 from the reference section. Unzip it and place it in the Integrated Development (IDE) libraries folder (usually found in documents/Arduino/libraries). Continue to step 2.3. If building the MK II, proceed to step 2.2.\nAdd the microcontroller boards to the IDE, following the instructions15.\nDownload 'ThresholdTest.ino' for the MK I or 'BLEThresholdTest.ino' and 'BluefruitConfig.h' for the MK II and open in the IDE software (Supplemental files).\nUnplug the laptop from the mains and then, and only then, plug the microcontroller into the laptop via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable.\nUpload the relevant version of the threshold test to the microcontroller and then open the serial monitor (Tools>Serial Monitor). The output of the EMG will now be displayed.\nMove the index finger from side to side and move the hand around without moving the index finger. Write down the values displayed in each case.\n\tNOTE: When using the MK II make sure that the cables do not move as it is extremely sensitive to noise generated this way.\nSelect a value that is above what is seen when the hand is moved around, but below what is seen when the finger is moved from side to side. Write down this value.",
    "NOTE: The value is selected so that the device will only be activated by a purposeful movement of the finger. This is the Threshold Trigger Value, the value at which the device will be activated. The muscle sensor has a gain setting that can be manually altered if the threshold value is hard to find. The electrodes might need to be replaced. If using the abductor indicis muscle, set the gain to minimum as the starting point. The gain setting is altered by the potentiometer on the muscle sensor marked by GAIN, and this can be changed by a small flat-head screwdriver.\n3. Test Threshold\nDownload 'BoomTest.ino' for the MK I or 'BLEBoomTest.ino' and BluefruitConfig.h for the MK II and open it in the IDE software.\nEdit the provided code by replacing 'PLACE_YOUR_THRESHOLD_TRIGGER_VALUE_HERE' with the Threshold Trigger Value previously determined in step 2.8. This is line 37 of the code for the MK I and line 47 of the code for the MK II.\nUpload the correct version of BoomTest to the microcontroller and then open the serial monitor (Tools>Serial Monitor).\nMove the hand around (not moving the index finger from side to side); nothing is seen on the serial output.\nMove the index finger from side to side; the word 'BOOM' appears.\n\tNOTE: If 'BOOM' appears at the wrong time or not at all, check the connections and move back to step 2.7.\n4. 3D Print the MK II Case\nIf building the MK II, download the stl files for all 5 components of the case (see Figure 7 for all 5 parts). Print the parts of the case by any preferred method. Proceed to step 5.2. If building the MK I, move on to section 5.",
    "NOTE: The case has been successfully printed by both fused deposition modelling16 (FDM) and photolithography printers17.\n5. Solder the Control Board\nNOTE: If building the MK II, proceed to step 5.2.\nPlace a row of two header pins, five 10 KΩ resistors, a sliding switch and two push button switches for the components as shown in Figure 8A; then solder them in place on the underside of the board.\nBreak the copper tracks on the strip board by slicing through with a craft knife, following the grey lines on Figure 8A. This allows for individual tracks to have multiple functions across the board.\nCut 7 wires (black, red, blue, orange, white, brown and yellow) of the correct length with a wire cutter so that they will run from the forearm to the upper arm (around 30 cm). Cut a red wire of 7 cm, a black wire of 3 cm and an orange and a blue wire of 4 cm.\nStrip both ends of the wires with a wire stripper.\nPlace the wires in the control board, following the circuit diagram shown in Figure 9; solder the wires in place on the underside.\nSolder the long red and black wires to a pair of header pins, and then solder the other long wires to a strip of header pins in the order: blue, orange, white, brown, yellow.\nSolder the 5V and GND pins of the wireless module to the header pins on the control board.\nSolder the short orange wire to pin 2 of the wireless communication module and the short blue wire to pin 3.\nPlace three 10 KΩ resistors, a sliding switch and two push button switches as shown in Figure 10A and solder them into place on the underside of the board.",
    "Break the copper tracks on the strip board by slicing through with a craft knife, following the grey lines on Figure 10A. This allows for the track to have multiple functions on the board.\nCut the wires that were previously soldered to the microcontroller with a wire cutter so that they can run through the mid layer of the microcontroller case to the control board without stopping the case from closing (Figure 10B).\nPlace the wires in the control board, following the circuit diagram (Figure 11). Solder the wires in place. Proceed to step 6.2.\n6. Assemble Clicker and Update Microcontroller\nRe-assemble the Bionic Clicker, connecting the header connectors from the control board wires to the microcontroller and bio-signals shield (5V and GND on the MK I, pin 22-30 on the MKII). Connect the battery to the microcontroller. See Figure 12. Move on to step 6.3.\nRe-assemble the Bionic Clicker, connecting the header connector from the microcontroller to the muscle sensor (green wire to SIG). See Figure 13.\nConnect the microcontroller to the laptop via USB cable.\nDownload 'BionicClicker.ino' or 'BLEBionicClicker.ino and BluefruitConfig.h and open it in the IDE software.\nEdit the code and replace 'PLACE_YOUR_THRESHOLD_TRIGGER_VALUE_HERE' with the Threshold Trigger Value determined in step 2.7 (on line 59 of the code for the MK I, line 83 of the code for the MK II).\n\tNOTE: The name that the MK II device appears as when connecting over wireless can be changed by editing line 47 of the code. Replace 'Bionic Clicker MK II' with an alternative title.\nDisconnect the microcontroller from the laptop by removing the USB cable.\n7. Connect the Device to a Computer",
    "If using the MK I, follow the instructions to pair the wireless module to the device by following the manufacturer's guide18. If using the MK II, connect to the device wirelessly following the procedure to connect a wireless keyboard to the computer being used.\n8. Test the Clicker\nOpen some typing software and enter some text, such as 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'. This allows the presses to be perceived to test whether these commands are sent and received.\n\tNOTE: If the battery is low the device may give erratic behavior; always use a fresh battery.\n\t\nPress the manual forward button to see the cursor move forward and the manual backwards button to see the cursor move backwards. Raise the index finger to also move forward.\nTo test the clicker with the presentation software, raise the index finger to progress the slides.\n\tNOTE: The override switch turns the EMG function on and off, and the manual forward and backwards buttons progress and retreat the slides in both scenarios.\n9. Mount the Clicker\nNOTE: If building the MK II move to step 9.2.\nIf building the MK I, cut the double-sided hook and loop material with scissors, so that it fits comfortably around the wrist. Make sure the loops are facing inwards to not scratch the wrist.\nCut the double-sided hook and loop material so that it fits comfortably around the upper arm, again make sure the loops face inwards.\nCut the double-sided hook and loop strips to the size of the microcontroller (10 cm x 5 cm) and the control board (2.5 cm x 6.4 cm). Cut a strip that will fit tightly around the battery (4 cm x 12 cm).",
    "Using the glue gun, glue the loop side of the strips to the bottom of the microcontroller and the bottom of the control board.\nAttach the control board to the wrist strap. Attach the microcontroller and battery to the upper arm strap.\nPlug everything in: The 9 V battery plugs into the microcontroller with the PP3 connector. The microcontroller and e-health shield connect to the control board via the soldered wires.\n\t\tNOTE: The MK I is now finished.\nIf building the MK II, cut double-sided hook and loop material 35 mm wide and long enough to wrap around the wrist (around 22 cm for smaller wrists).\nSlide the hook and loop material through the clips at the bottom of the case. Make sure that the loops are facing inwards to not scratch the wrist.\nPlug the wires soldered to the microcontroller terminating in the female header into the male header pins on the muscle sensor, and clip the electrodes into the EMG cables by pushing them on.\n\t\tNOTE: The MK II is now finished. See Figure 14."
