(1989)           by mixing 50 μl of the suspension in 2 ml of 80% acetone (vortex) in an Eppendorf cup.Distribute the suspension equally on two fresh SS34 centrifuge tubes and spin for 20 min at 40,000 × g with Sorvall centrifuge.At room temperature, resuspend pellets in pure H2O with the volume determined by the chlorophyll content: ml H2O = 2 × mg chlorophyll (measured). The final chlorophyll concentration should be 0.5 mg/ml. Transfer to 150 ml beaker.Stir the suspension slowly and slowly add (dropwise) Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v): ml added Triton X-100 = ml H2O × 0.005.Incubate under slow stirring for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugationTake six prepared tubes with the 30 ml sucrose density gradient (0.1 to 1 M).Overlay the suspension equally on the six tubes (approximately 6 ml per tube) (see Note 1).Prepare the swing bucket SW28 rotor.Spin for 16 h (overnight) at 100,000 × g.The next day carefully harvest the LHCII band that is the middle band (dark green) in the gradient with a glass pipette.Determine the volume of the combined suspension with a 50 ml measuring cylinder.Determine the chlorophyll concentration according to           Porra et al. (1989)          , as described above.",

Determine the total volume and the chlorophyll concentration according to           Porra et al. (1989)           by using 20 μl of suspension in 2 ml of 80% acetone.Spin for 40,000 × g for 15 min.Resuspend the pellet in 0.35% Triton X-100 solution so that the final chlorophyll concentration is 2 mM.Centrifuge with low speed to remove bubbles. Aliquot the isolated LHCII (50 μl per aliquot) to Eppendorf Cups. Flash-freeze samples in liquid nitrogen and store the isolated LHCII at -80°C (see Note 2).Preparation of LHCII-proteoliposomesPreparation of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs)Assemble Lipex® Extruder according to the manufacture’s manual with 400 nm filter and preheat to 60°C in oven.Fill 250 ml beaker ¾ with hot water.Heat water bath for rotary evaporator to 50°C.Mix desired lipid solution (dissolved in chloroform) in a 5 ml glass grinding tube with a total amount of 2.4 μmol lipids. The typical mixture is MGDG (25 mol%), DGDG (48 mol%), PG (15 mol%), and SQDG (12 mol%).Adjust water temperature in 250 ml beaker to ~40°C by adding cold water and using a thermometer.Place glass tube with lipid mixture halfway in 250 ml beaker. Evaporate chloroform carefully (no splashing) under nitrogen gas until it looks dry.",
    "Connect 5 ml glass grinding tube with dried lipid film to rotary evaporate, start rotating, activate vacuum, and lower the tube ~¼ into the 50°C water bath. Evaporate remaining solvent with a rotor evaporator for 15 min. Turn off the evaporator and rotor and release the vacuum by replacing it with N2 gas. Take the 5 ml glass tube from the rotary evaporator and cap it.Add 1.2 ml of HEPES buffer to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf cup and bubble gently for 1 min with N2 gas to reduce oxygen concentration.Add 700 ml of 10 mM HEPES buffer (bubbled with N2 gas before) to the dry lipid film and vortex thoroughly until the lipid film is completely dissolved. The solution should look milky.Connect the preheated Lipex® Extruder (60°C) to the nitrogen gas tank. Fill in lipid emulsion and wait for 30 s (emulsion heats up to extruder temperature). Extrude the lipid emulsion 10 times. After the final extrusion, add the remaining 300 μl of N2-bubbled HEPES buffer to flush out remaining liposomes from extruder. Replace the 400 nm filter with a 200 nm filter. Extrude another 10 times as before. Collect the LUVs in an Eppendorf cup and store the LUVs at 4°C.Reconstitution of LHCII in LUVs (LHCII-proteoliposomes)Keep samples with LHCII protein in the dark (dark cover).Allow frozen LHCII aliquot to thaw slowly on ice in the dark (ice bucket with lid). The thawing can take 30-60 min.Solubilize and dilute LHCII preparation (in this order): In an Eppendorf cup, mix HEPES buffer, 500 μM α-DM (stock 73.6 mM), and LHCII (final chlorophyll concentration 25 μM) to a total volume of 220 μl. Keep the diluted LHCII on ice in the dark until use in Step B2e.",
    "Mixed detergent-liposomes: In a 3-ml spectrometer glass cuvette with micro stir bar, add total LUV sample and fill up to a total volume of 1.6 ml with HEPES buffer. Stir solution slowly and add 20 μl 73.6 mM α-DM to an end concentration of 920 μM α-DM (see Note 3). Let it stir for 5 min.Slowly add 200 μl of diluted LHCII solution to the stirring detergent-liposome suspension (chlorophyll end concentration 2.8 μM) and incubate for 30 min in the dark.Add 25 mg of wet Biobeads and continue stirring for 60 min in the dark at room temperature.Add an additional 100 mg of wet Biobeads and continue stirring for another 25 min in the dark at room temperature.Transfer the BioBead-proteoliposome suspension to a fresh Eppendorf cup (minimize transfer of BioBeads) and spin for 20 min at 18,000 × g at 4°C. Harvest the supernatant carefully and transfer to a fresh Eppendorf cup.Finally, purify the LHCII-proteoliposomes further by gel-filtration with a Sephadex G-25 M PD10 gel filtration column equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES buffer. Collect samples with a fraction collector filled with glass test tubes in 30 s intervals. Collect and combine the faint green samples that are the final LHCII-proteoliposome preparation, transfer to Eppendorf cup, and store on ice in the dark.Determine lipid and protein contentLipid content can be measured by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography of a lipid extract, as described in           Kirchhoff et al. (2018)          .The protein content can be determined from a spectroscopic chlorophyll quantification of an 80% acetone extract, according to           Porra et al. (1989)          . For the 80% acetone extract, use a 100 μl sample and dilute in 400 μl of 100% acetone. Calculate total chlorophyll concentration in nmol/ml according to           Porra et al. (1989)          . Use an appropriate spectrometer cuvette that can handle 500 μl samples.",
    "For calculation of the LHCII-trimer concentration from total chlorophyll, assume a total chlorophyll to LHCII-trimer ratio of 42 to 1 (Barros and Kühlbrandt, 2009).Characterization by low temperature (77 K) fluorescence spectroscopy (see Tietz et al., 2020)Prepare the fluorescence spectrometer for emission scan between 640 and 800 nm, with a 475 nm excitation wavelength and optical bandwidth of 4 nm.Fill Dewar carefully with liquid nitrogen (wear protection goggles).Mix in Eppendorf cup by careful pipetting 346 μl LHCII-proteoliposomes, 2 μl catalase, 2 μl glucose oxidase, and 10 μl glucose; wait 5 min to establish anaerobic conditions (see Note 4).Transfer the sample into the 77 K sample tube and freeze carefully by dipping into Dewar filled with liquid N2 (wear protection goggles). Place the frozen sample in the 77 K sample tube very slowly in 77 K Dewar (sample tubes break if moved in too fast). Adjust test tube position in the fluorimeter beam if required.Record and average four emission scans."
