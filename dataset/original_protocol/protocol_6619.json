    "Preparation of cellsPlate cells at 100 x 20 mm cell culture dishes. Culture cells in DMEM with 10% FBS (Fujiki et al., 2019; Guillaume Canaud et al., 2019; Das et al., 2020) and 200 μM PA in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.Procedure for ImmunoprecipitationCell LysisCarefully discard culture medium from cells.Gently wash the cells once with 4 ml pre-chilled PBS.Lyse the cells with pre-chilled IP lysis/wash buffer (IP kit) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor on ice for 10 min.Note: 500 μl lysis buffer is used for one 100 mm x 20 mm cell culture dish. Collect the lysate to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and continue lysing on ice for 20 min.Note: Mix every 10 min to ensure complete lysis. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g, 4 °C, for 20 min.Collect the supernatant to a new tube and discard the cellular debris.Detect protein concentration of cell lysate using BCA Protein Assay Kit and spectrophotometer. Prepare 1 mg protein for IP and 30 μg protein for input.Note: The range of the STD curve of BCA assay is 50-2,000 μg/ml, and the ODs of the samples fall on the end of the STD curve. Pre-clear cell lysateAdd 80 μl of the Control Agarose Resin slurry to a spin column.Note: Gently swirl the bottle of Control Agarose Resin before use. For 1 mg of cell lysate use 80 μl of the Control Agarose Resin. The volume of the Control Agarose Resin was proportional to the mass of the cell lysate. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min to remove storage buffer.Add 100 μl 1x Coupling Buffer to the column, centrifuge at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min and discard the flow-through.",
    "Add 1 mg of cell lysate to the column containing the resin and incubate at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotator.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min, collect the flow-through to a new tube and place it on ice for later use.Note: The resin and column are from the IP kit. Antibody bind to protein A/G plus agaroseAdd 20 μl of the Protein A/G Plus Agarose resin (IP kit) into a spin column. Place column into a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min. Discard the flow-through.Note: Gently swirl the bottle of Pierce Protein A/G Plus Agarose before use. Wash agarose resin twice with 200 μl of 1x Coupling Buffer and centrifuge at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min after each wash. Discard the flow-through.Add 10 μl (1 μg/μl) of mouse acetyl-lysine antibody, 5 μl of 20x Coupling Buffer and 85 μl of ultrapure water to the resin in the column. Do the same for normal mouse IgG control.Incubate in a rotator at room temperature for 60 min.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min and discard the flow-through.Antigen ImmunoprecipitationAdd 1 mg cell lysate into the acetyl-lysine antibody crosslinked resin in the column.Note: The volume of protein lysates is better to between 300 μl and 600 μl. Incubate in a rotator at 4 °C overnight.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min and discard the flow-through.Add 200 μl of IP Lysis/Wash Buffer to wash the sample, centrifuge at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min and discard the flow-through. Repeat this wash once.Antigen ElutionAdd 30μl of Elution Buffer (IP kit) and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g, 4 °C for 1 min and collect the flow-through.",
    "Add the flow-through (Step B5b) into column and centrifuge again. Collect the flow-through (IP samples).Sample preparation for Western blotting analysisAdd 4x SDS-PAGE loading buffer to samples to make 1x final solutions.Heated the IP samples and Input samples at 100 °C for 5 min to denature the protein.Procedure for western blotting analysisPrepare 12% SDS-PAGE gels.Load 30μg protein per mini-gel well. Run the gel with 80 voltage, 30 min and then 120 voltage, 45 min.Transfer proteins of the gel to PVDF membranes under wet transfer condition at 100 voltage about 60 min in ice/water bath under room temperature.Blocking the membranes with 5% defatted milk for 1 h at room temperature.Wash the membranes with TBST for 5 min at room temperature.Incubate membranes with Anti-LCAD antibody (1:1,000), Anti-beta-HAD antibody (1:1,000) and Anti-COXIV antibody (1:5,000) which diluent in 2% defatted milk on a rocker at 4 °C overnight.Wash the membranes three times for 10 min with TBST at room temperature on a rocker.Incubation with secondary Anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated antibody for 60 min at room temperature.Wash the membranes three times for 10 min with TBST at room temperature on a rocker.Visualize protein bands by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Figure 2). Exposure time is about 20 s.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200915/20200915000854_8524.jpgFigure 2. The acetylation level of LCAD and β-HAD was increased after PA stimulation. Ac-LCAD and Ac-β-HAD was detected by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. IgG group was negative control to detect no-specific binding protein. Since LCAD and β-HAD were mitochondrial protein, the mitochondrial contents were normalized by using the internal mitochondrial reference COX IV."
