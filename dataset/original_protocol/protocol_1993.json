    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n4C primer design\nPrimer design is the crucial step for the success of 4C-seq. Cistrome or epigenome data are helpful to define the open chromatin regions enriched with transcription factors (TFs) and coregulators. Such regions usually define the 3D chromatin structures that aim to be detected by 4C-seq. We can also get the profile of the local environment (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) in the gene locus of interest. Restriction sites within and surrounding the center of those regions can be analyzed using SnapGene or other relevant software. The chromatin region we select in this protocol was identified as a silencer in Ccl2 locus previously (Huang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The DNA profiles interacting with this specific silencer might be helpful for understanding its transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1591-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A guide for the designing of a 4C-seq primer\n(A) One example showing the integration with epigenetic profile within a gene locus (GPS2 ChIP-seq GEO: GSM4848601) to mark the local DNA environment. Ccl2 silencer and promoter and the nearby enhancer regions are highlighted. The silencer region is further zoomed in to check the enzyme distribution (DpnII and NalIII are used in this case).\n(B) Schematic representation of 4C-PCR primers design principles. The interaction fragments are amplified with a reading primer tails. The “self-ligation” and “non-digestion” fragments are the top list of the amplified products. The viewpoint window is further zoomed in to highlight the PCR primers. Normally, the reading primer is within 35 bp to the first enzyme site and inverse PCR primer is within 100 bp to the second enzyme site.\n(C) Schematic representation of the 4C DNA fragments formation workflow in each step and the integration with the DNA gel distribution.",
    "NlaIII, DpnII, Csp6I, BfaI and MboI (4-cutter) are commonly used as the step 1 restriction enzymes since they are widely distributed in the target genome. They are also highly efficient in digesting the crosslinked DNA. The first restriction enzyme site must avoid the transcription factor binding centers because those regions usually facilitate the loop formation and disruption of them may affect the 4C-seq efficiency (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Once a proper first restriction enzyme is selected, the reading primer (inverse PCR) is fixed which contains the restriction site sequence in the 3′ terminal (in this case, we used DpnII). The reading primer is normally between 20 to 35 bp close to the first enzyme site. The inverse PCR primer is dependent on the location and can be selected in different restriction enzyme combinations. In this case, we used DpnII-NalIII for detecting the mice Ccl2 Silencer interactions in RAW cells. The inverse PCR primer should be close to the second enzyme in the target region and there should be no additional second enzyme sites between the reading primer and inverse primer. The inverse PCR primer is normally 20 bp, but can be up to 100 bp to the closest second enzyme site (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nIllustrated step strategy is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C. The 4C-PCR will amplify all the possible interaction fragments which contain the reading primer. The detailed protocol is shown below.\nAmplify the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line\nTiming: 4–7 days for amplifying and seeding the RAW264.7 cells\nAll the workflows are summarized in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C as an overview of a 4C experiment and the main experimental stages are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1591-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of 4C template and library preparation for sequencing",
    "Thaw the RAW264.7 cells and culture them in 75 cm flask, 37°C, 5% CO2. The cells are maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin/ streptomycin (P/S).\nChange the medium the next day and check the cell states.\nWhen the cells become to 90% confluency in the 75 cm flask, use the cell lifter to scrap out the RAW264.7 cells and passage them in another two 150 cm plates with 1:3 dilution ratio. Wait for another two days until the cells fully recover.\nWhen the cells become 90% confluent, scrap out the cells and count the cell number. Seed 2 × 107 cells/plate in four 150 cm plates with 30 mL full DMEM medium. Maintain the cells overnight and wait for another day.\nCritical: RAW264.7 cells are very sensitive to any endotoxin (e.g., lipopolysaccharide or LPS) and cytokines (e.g., interleukin 6 or IL6) in the culture medium. The normal RAW264.7 cells are small, round shaped with tiny antennas. The cells are mildly attached to the flask in the normal condition. When the cells are activated by inflammatory stimulus during the amplification, they will firmly attach to the flask and the cell shape will change from round to spindle.\nMacrophages activation for the 4C-seq experiment\nTiming: 2 h for LPS/IL4 treatment, 10 min for crosslinking cells\nThe treatment is optional according to experiment requirements. In this protocol, we used the WT RAW264.7 cells without any treatment (start from step 7).\nPrepare 10 ng/mL LPS or 20 ng/mL IL4 using the full DMEM culture medium (optional) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).",
    "Set two plates of the cells as control group and change the medium with 25 mL 10% FBS DMEM medium. Set the other two plates as treatment group and change the medium to 25 mL 10% FBS DMEM medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL LPS or 20 ng/mL IL4 cells for two hours (optional).\nWash the cells with 10 mL DPBS at room temperature two times. Prepare 2% formaldehyde (stock: 37% formaldehyde) solution with DPBS.\nCrosslink the protein-DNA complexes by incubating the cells with 10 mL 2% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking.\nStop the cross-linking by adding glycine into the formaldehyde fixed cells to a final concentration of 125 mM (stock: 2.5 M glycine) and incubate for 5 min at room temperature with gentle shaking (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nWash the cells three times with ice cold DPBS.\nScrap the plates in 10 mL cold DPBS (with 1× protease inhibitors) and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nWash two more times with DPBS (with protease inhibitors).\nCount the crosslinked cells and aliquot 107 cells into 1.5 mL tubes.\nSpin down the cells at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant and freeze the samples at −80°C or continue with cell lysis.\n∗ SAFE Stop point. The cell pellets can be stored at −80°C for a few months.",
    "Critical: The viability is important to get high quality and stable results. More than 90% of alive cells are good cell viability to process the downstream experiments. Less than 70% of alive cells might change the data reproducibility. Normally, 105–107 cell numbers are a suitable range, which are dependent on the gene loci (high or low expression), region of interest (enhancer or silencer), and the formation time of the DNA looping, etc (Krijger et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). The strong looping anchors give more signals than the weak ones. Low input cell numbers might not be able to capture low or moderate chromatin interactions. So, the minimum cell number can be 105 if the condition does not permit, but people must understand that the low cell number will restrict the 4C contact building. For inducible inflammatory genes, the intra-TAD DNA interactions are dynamic, and triggered by stimulus such as LPS, IL4, etc. Local eRNA expression can reflect the potential loop facilitated cis-regulatory element activities and can be used for selecting the best monitoring time of the treatment. The crosslinking condition (both formaldehyde concentration and treatment time) can be applied to the other in vitro cells including primary cells and cell lines. For 3D organoids or tissue samples, the crosslinking condition should be optimized before the further steps.\n4C-library preparation\nTiming: 7–9 days\nThe following steps are the cell lysis for 4C template. We perform the analysis in biological replicates. Here we only describe the protocol in 10 million untreated cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nWash the cells with 1 mL cold DPBS (with protease inhibitors) one time.\nSpin down the cells at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.

    "Critical: 4C-PCR (inverse PCR) primer design principle is by previous publication, and it is optimized before the experiment (Krijger et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; van de Werken et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). The reading primer (within 20 bp to the first restriction enzyme site) and the reverse primer (within 100 bp to the second restriction enzyme site). In our case, we selected DpnII (first enzyme) and NlaIII (second enzyme). The primer is needed to test the specificity before the real 4C-PCR. A pre-PCR is preferably needed to determine the amplification sensitivity due to the 4C template concentration. A good 4C-PCR will give a strong DNA smear with “self-ligation” and “undigested” bands and different with the 4C template distribution (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nLibrary preparation for sequencing\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThe library preparation of 4C-seq was performed directly using Takara ThruPLEX DNA-Seq kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Import the files to R, and execute the code to extract the tags of target regions:\n>Ccl2_silencer<-read.delim2(\"RAW_4C_seq_silencer_rp1_WIN21.txt\",head=TRUE)\n>Ccl2_silencer_f<-subset(Ccl2_silencer, start >81816382 & start <81822382)\n>sum(Ccl2_silencer_f$tags)\nIn our case, we used Ccl2 promoter and enhancer 4C bait to find the potential interaction during gene activation. We used chr11: 81,816,382–81,822,382 (Ccl2 enhancer), chr11:81,846,000–81,852,000 (Ccl2 promoter) and chr11: 81,785,479–81,791,479 (Control region) to count the tags.\nVisualize the tags in GraphPad software (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). If three biology replicates are provided, the statistical analysis could be done. Otherwise, show the results with ± SEM plots.\nNote: The 4Cseqpipe provides relative interaction frequency plots around the viewpoint to display the potential interaction regions. This method uses viewpoint as the centre (treat as 1). The captured 4C contacts will be plotted according to the relative frequency. The pipe4C provides the quantitative normalization files, which use the total tags counts (106) and the target chromosome region as background.",
    "Critical: DNA interaction ranges are different from gene to gene which are dependent on the local DNA environment, TF binding, histone modification and CTCF location. So, it is better to make multiple comparisons using different ChIP-seq data and to use many plot ranges from 100 kb to 1 mb. It is useful to find all the possible cis interaction regions (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). On one hand, the ChIP-seq data will give the TFs and co-regulators binding center which participate in the DNA loop formation. On the other hand, some gene activation histone marker ChIP-seq (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, etc.) will give the epigenetic environment changes, which will indicate the 4C-seq changes make any sense. For more details, please refer to (Huang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In our case we do not check the trans interaction search since it is not common and needs additional primer designs."
