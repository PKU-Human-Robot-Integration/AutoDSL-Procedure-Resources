One revertant corresponds to one amino acid mutation in the heavy or light chain. An example of the germline revertants of a VRC01-class bnAb 2411a (Chen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1448-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Amino acid sequence alignment of the HCs and LCs of a parental VRC01-class bnAb 2411a and its germline revertants (Gr1-Gr31) against the germline VH1-2∗02 and VK3-20∗01 respectively\n“-” indicates the same residue as the germline; mutated V-region residues in the bnAb and the revertants are shown as black single letter codes, whereas the germline reverted residues are marked in blue or red color. Mutation of the red-labeled residues are key mutations (Chen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).",
    "Order the designed germline revertants from GenScript with their point mutagenesis service, in which they will need the original heavy and light chain expression vectors of the target bnAb as templates to make a series of mutated heavy and light chain constructs, each containing only one germline reverted residue.\nThe expression plasmids for the revertants are usually ready in two-three weeks.\nNote: The revertant constructs can also be generated using a QuickChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) or Q5 Site-Directed mutagenesis kit with NEBaseChanger web tool (New England Biolabs). While waiting for the germline revertant heavy and light chains to be synthesized, you could perform the single B cell sorting and RT-PCR of VRC01-class IgG sequences from splenocytes of mice sacrificed at different time points of the immunization course, as described in steps 31–32.\nExpression and purification of germline revertant mutants of the target bnAb\nTiming: 8 days\nThis part describes how to produce and purify the germline revertant mutants of the target bnAb. We need to make germline revertant antibodies each containing only one germline-reverted residue, so we need to pair each mutant heavy chain with the parental bnAb light chain and pair each mutant light chain with the parental bnAb heavy chain for antibody production.\nTransient transfection of Expi293 cells to produce germline revertants (7 days)\nGrow 2 L Expi293F™ cells in Expi293™ Expression Medium to 3–5 × 106/mL in a cell incubator at 37°C, 8% CO2, 60% humidity with 125 rpm shaking. These cells should be sufficient to prepare 24–40 × 100 mL-transfections to express 24–40 mutant antibodies.\nOn the day of transfection, transfect 100 mL Expi293 (2.5 × 106/mL) cells for expression of each germline revertant antibody. All procedures at this step are operated in a biosafety hood.",
    "Dilute the 2 L Expi293F™ cells to 2.5 × 106/mL with fresh warm Expi293™ Expression Medium and split into 100mL-aliquots in 250mL-baffled-flasks.\nWarm 1× Opti-MEM medium in 37°C water bath.\nFor each transfection, mix 50 μg heavy chain plasmid and 50 μg light chain plasmid in 5 mL 1× Opti-MEM medium, and filter the mix through a MilliporeSigma™ Steriflip™ Sterile Disposable Vacuum Filter Unit (0.22 μm PES filter on a 50 mL conical tube).\nFor each transfection, add 0.27 mL ExpiFectamine™ 293 Reagent to 5 mL 1× Opti-MEM medium, mix gently and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd the ExpiFectamine™ mix from iv to the plasmid mix from iii in the 50 mL conical tube, mix gently by swirling and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.\nPour the transfection mix (∼10 mL) to one 250 mL-flask containing 100 mL 2.5 × 106/mL Expi293F™ cells.\nIncubate the transfected cells in a cell culture incubator at 37°C, 8% CO2, 60% humidity with 125 rpm shaking.\nOn day 2, add 0.5 mL ExpiFectamine™ 293 Transfection Enhancer 1 and 5 mL ExpiFectamine™ 293 Transfection Enhancer 2 to each flask of cells, and continue incubation under the same condition for 5–6 more days.\nNote: To improve protein yield, the cells can also be incubated at 32°C during day 3–7 with the other conditions unchanged. It is better to produce the parental bnAb as a reference control together with the germline revertant antibodies.\nPurification of the parental and germline revertant antibodies (1 day).\nOn day 7 post transfection, collect the ∼115 mL of cell culture from each flask and centrifuge the cells down in one-time use centrifugal flasks at 2000 × g for 15 min.",
    "Sterile filter each supernatant with a 0.2 μm Nalgene Rapid-Flow 250 mL-filter unit and check the pH of the supernatant to make sure that it is between 7.0 and 8.0, for optimal rProtein A binding of mouse IgG2a at next step.\nApply the filtered supernatant onto 0.8 mL rProtein A Sepharose FF (GE health) pre-equilibrated in PBS in a disposable 10 mL poly-prep column with a 250 mL funnel attached on top.\nLet the medium run through the column by gravity, remove the funnel and wash column 2×, each with 10 mL PBS (pH7.4).\nElute antibody with 5 mL GE IgG elution buffer and collect the eluate with constant shaking in a 15 mL conical tube containing 0.5 mL 1 M Tris, pH8.\nConcentrate the eluted antibodies to above 1 mg/mL, as needed, in Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units.\nDialyze the antibodies in Slide-A-Lyzer G2 cassettes (3 mL size, 20 kD molecular weight cutoff) against 4 L PBS three times, with 1.5 h stirring at room temperature or 4°C overnight each time.\nCritical: Some antibodies tend to precipitate during pH neutralization. The drop-by-drop elution into 1M Tris, pH8 with constant shaking can effectively reduce or eliminate precipitation. Constant shaking during elution is critical for quick and sufficient pH neutralization and prevention of antibody precipitation.\nBinding assay of germline revertants to identify key mutations\nTiming: 2 days\nELISA of the parental bnAb and its germline revertant mutants against a panel of antigens to assess the impact of each SHM-resulted residue change of the bnAb on its binding activity.\nChoose a panel of HIV-1 envelope protein antigens as the ELISA binding substrates for the tested bnAb and its germline revertants.",
    "Note: The panel should include envelopes from different strains of HIV-1 viruses to examine the binding breadth of the tested antibodies, and some CD4bs-disrupting mutants of the envelope as negative control to check the CD4bs-specificity of the antibodies.\nCoat 96-well costar half-area microplates with the panel of purified antigens:\nPrepare sufficient antigen coating solution in PBS at 2 μg/mL for each antigen: total volume = number of antibodies to test × 3 (3 antibody concentrations) × 50 μL × 1.05 (5% extra)\nFor each antigen, coat a 96-well costar half-area plate with the 2 μg/mL antigen coating solution at 50 μL per well. Each coated plate is sufficient to test 32 antibodies (target bnAb and its germline revertants) at three different concentrations.\nPut all coated plates in stacks and cover the top plates with either a plate cover or plate sealing film and incubate the plates at 4°C overnight.\nOn the 2nd day, remove the coating solutions in all plates and wash them 1× with 200 μL PBS/T (PBS with 0.05% Tween) per well in a BioTek plate washer.\nBlock all plates with 1:10 diluted (with PBS) Blocking/Diluent Solution (Immune Technology) at 50 μL per well and incubate them at room temperature for 1 h.\nDuring the blocking period, prepare solutions of the parental or germline revertant antibodies each at three different concentrations (10, 1 and 0.1 μg/mL) in PBS/T containing 2% ImmuneTech Blocking Reagent.\nDistribute 2 mL of the antibody solutions from step 11 into each well of a 96-well deep-well plate according to Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1448-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A) ELISA plate/well setting for 1st antibody binding step. The graph shows the plate/well setting for testing the parent antibody and up to 31 germline revertant (Gr) antibodies in a 96-well ELISA plate coated with one antigen. Each antibody is tested in three different concentrations, 10, 1, and 0.1 μg/mL, to avoid overdosing or underdosing and to best detect the binding difference between a revertant and the parent antibody.\n(B) Example of a heat map showing the binding (OD450) of a VRC01-class bnAb (Parental) and its 31 germline revertants (Gr) to a panel of 23 HIV envelope-based antigens at three different concentrations: 10, 1 and 0.1 μg/mL. ∗ marks the optimal concentration for detecting changes between Gr and Parent.\nWash blocked ELISA plates 5× with PBS/T (200 μL/well per wash) in a BioTek plate washer.\nTransfer 50 μL/well from the deep-well plate to each well of the antigen-coated ELISA plate.\nIncubate the plates at room temperature for 1 h.\nRepeat step 13.\nAdd 50 μL/well SureBlue™ TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL) to all plates with a 96-well liquidator in order, wait for 10 min for color development at room temperature.\nAdd 50 μL/well 1 N H2SO4 to all plates in the same order, to quench the color development.\nRead all plates for OD450 using a microplate reader.\nData analysis:\nVisualization of ELISA data in a heat map like Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nFor each antigen, determine the antibody concentration at which the OD450 display the best dynamic range among the tested antibodies. For example, data obtained at 0.1 μg/mL for UG037.8 and 10 μg/mL for ZM53 core should be chosen for further analysis of binding titer changes of germline revertant antibodies.",
    "For each germline revertant, determine the OD450 ratio of the parental antibody to the germline revertant at the best antibody concentration for each antigen (as determine in 20b), and take the average of all the ratios for every antigen as the binding fold change index, Fb, for that germline revertant antibody.\n  F b  =  1 n  ∗  ∑  i = 1  n     O D  450 i P    O D  450 i  G r      ,  n  =  the  number  of  antigens \nWe artificially define any fold change larger than 1.5 as significant, demonstrating that the SHM in the corresponding germline revertant has a significant impact on the binding of the target bnAb to its antigens.\nIdentify all key mutations that cause >= 1.5-fold change in binding index.\nTZM-bl neutralization assay of germline revertants to identify key mutations\nTiming: 1 week\nVirus panel selection: based on the large-panel neutralization data of the target bnAb, select a panel of 10 bnAb-sensitive viruses from different clades with at least moderate neutralization titers by the bnAb. An exemplar panel for VRC01-class bnAb 2411a is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A. The criteria for the virus panel selection include: 1) select from the bnAb -sensitive viruses, since a non-sensitive virus is not helpful for the antibody loss-of-function analysis; 2) select from different viral clades and be as representative as possible to the full panel; 3) avoid virus strains already sensitive to unmutated bnAb precursors; 4) choose viruses with moderate-high neutralizing titers to the bnAb: viruses with too high titers are often also sensitive to the germline precursor, whereas those with too low titers do not have the range to show significant titer change in response to SHM revertant.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1448-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(A) Exemplar neutralization results showing IC50s of a parental VRC01-class bnAb (2411a) and its germline revertants against a panel of 10 sensitive viruses from different clades. The color-code for IC50 goes from strong neutralization (red) to weak (green). No neutralization observed at greater than 50 μg/mL is shown in white.\n(B) Exemplar neutralization curves of a parental bnAb 2411a and its germline revertants of non-key mutations (gray curves) vs. key mutations (red curves) against virus strain RHPA.7.\nPseudovirus preparation: Pseudoviruses for use in TZM-bl neutralization assays were produced in 293T cells by cotransfection of a pSG3ΔEnv backbone plasmid and a full HIV-1 Env gp160-encoding plasmid (Li et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\n2 × 106 cells in 20 mL cDMEM (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) were seeded in T75 flasks the day prior to cotransfection.\nFor transfection, 40 μL of FuGene 6 reagent (Promega) was diluted into 800 μL of room-temperature Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Thermo Fisher), followed by addition of 10 μg of pSG3ΔEnv backbone plasmid.\n3.3 μg of HIV Env plasmid was then added to the mixture, mixed, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.\nTransfection mixture was then added to media of previously seeded 293T cells in the T75 flask and then distributed evenly on cells.\nThe following day, media was replaced with 20 mL fresh cDMEM.\nVirus was harvested the following day by filtering cell supernatants with 0.45 μm Steriflip units (EMD Millipore) and aliquoted.\nTo measure neutralization of purified antibodies,\n10 μL of five-fold serially diluted mAbs in cDMEM was incubated with 40ul of diluted HIV-1 Env-pseudotyped virus and incubated for 30 min at 37oC in a 96-well CulturPlate (Perkin Elmer).\n20 μL of TZM-bl cells (10,000 cells/well) with or without 70 μg/mL DEAE-Dextran was then added and incubated overnight at 37oC.",
    "Each experiment plate also had a column of cells only (no Ab or virus) and a column of virus only (no Ab) as controls for background TZM-bl luciferase activity and maximal viral entry, respectively.\nCritical: Serial dilutions were performed with a change of tips at each dilution step to prevent carryover.\nThe following day, all wells received 100 μL of fresh cDMEM and were incubated overnight at 37oC.\nThe following day, 50 μL of Steadylite Plus Reporter Gene Assay System (PerkinElmer) was added to all wells, and plates were shaken at 600 rpm for 15 min.\nLuminometry was then performed on a SpectraMax L (Molecular Devices) luminometer. Percent neutralization is determined by calculating the difference in average Relative Light Unit (RLU) between virus only wells (cells + virus column) and test wells (cells + plasma/Ab sample + virus), dividing this result by the average RLU of virus only wells (cell + virus column) and multiplying by 100. Background is subtracted from all test wells using the average RLU from the uninfected control wells (cells only column) before calculating the percent neutralization.\nNeutralizing antibody titers are expressed as the antibody concentration required to achieve 50% or 80% neutralization (IC50 or IC80) and calculated using a dose-response curve fit with a 5-parameter nonlinear function.\nFor each germline revertant, determine the IC50 ratio of the germline revertant to the parental antibody against each virus, and take the average of all the ratios for every tested virus as the neutralization fold change index, Fn, for that germline revertant antibody.\n  F n  =  1 m  ∗  ∑  j = 1  m     I C  50 j  G r     I C  50 j P     ,  m  =  the  number  of  viruses",
    "Identify all key mutations that cause >= 2-fold change in Fn, and especially focus on those that also cause >=1.5-fold change in binding (Fb).\nOptional: Structural analysis of identified key mutations.\nIf the structure of the parental bnAb in complex with its antigen is available or can be modeled based on known structures of similar antibodies, one can examine structurally why the identified key mutations contribute to improved antibody binding and neutralization activity, such as creating new antigen contact sites or reducing potential clash with antigens.\nLongitudinal analysis of antibody sequences to determine immunogens that elicit the key mutations\nTiming: 3 weeks\nThis part describes steps for obtaining VRC01-class antibody heavy and light chain sequences from different stages of sequential immunization and how to perform the longitudinal analysis of the SHM and key mutations in these antibodies.\nSingle B cell sorting with VRC01-class specific probes\nThaw frozen splenocytes (5–10 million cells) in 2-mL cryovials collected from different immunization stages in 37°C water bath.\nSpin down the cells at 500 × g for 3 min and remove the supernatants.\nWash the cells with 1 mL PBS by vertexing to resuspend the cells and re-spinning them down at 500 × g for 3 min.\nRemove the PBS and resuspend the cells in 100 μl of 1:1,000 diluted (in PBS) ViViD dye (40-test vial) that was reconstituted in 50 μL DMSO. Incubate in dark for 15 min.\nIn the meantime, prepare cell staining mix based on Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], and store on ice in dark.\nWash off extra ViViD by adding 1 mL cold PBS and spinning the cells down at 500 g for 3 min.",

    "Note: Sorting strategy rationale is as follows: ViViD- for live cells, CD3- CD4- and CD8- to gate out T cells, F4/80- to gate out macrophages, B220+ for B cells, IgD- IgM- and IgG+ for IgG+ memory B cells, eOD-GT6+ and its CD4bs-disrupting mutant eOD-GT6-KO- for eOD-GT6-binding CD4bs-specific B cells (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). We chose eOD-GT6 over eOD-GT8 because the former is more similar to gp120, has less engineered mutations and lower affinity to the unmutated VRC01-class precursors in the VH1-2/LC mice (Chen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Jardine et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), and can thus better select for and enrich VRC01-class B cell receptors with vaccine-elicited SHMs. However, do not use the additional BG505.SOSIP probe (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], step 8) for acquiring antibody sequences used for longitudinal mutation analysis, because the added selection by the BG505 probe artificially increases the frequency of more affinity matured antibodies among all acquired antibodies and miss out those with lower SHMs, which interferes with the evaluation of immunization impact on antibody SHM and key mutations.\nSeal the 96 well plate with a sealing film, vortex and centrifuge the plate to make sure the sorted cells are in the lysis buffer.\nFreeze the plate on dry ice or in a −80°C freezer and store it frozen at −80°C until next step.\nSingle B cell RT-PCR\nReverse Transcription (RT): For each 96 well plate, makes a master mix of RT/Superscript mix (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) and add 2.5 μL to each well with a multichannel pipet; perform RT reaction as described in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1448-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Sorting steps 1–7 are used to sort for eODGT6-reactive CD4bs-specific B cells which most likely encode VRC01-class antibodies in the VH1-2/LC mice. These antibodies should cover a wide range of SHM levels. Step 8 is added to select for B cells expressing more affinity matured and more cross-reactive VRC01-class antibodies, for example the target bnAb, that can bind the glycan276-containing BG505.SOSIP trimer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1448_6.csv\n∗Only use this probe when sorting for bnAb.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1448_7.csv\n1st PCR: Set up the 1st PCR reactions based on recipe in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] (make 100× master mix for each 96 well PCR plate) and run PCR under the conditions as described in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].
