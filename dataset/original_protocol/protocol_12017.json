    "All experiments with human tissue specimens were approved by the ethics committee of the Leiden University Medical Center and conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki. All steps are performed with sterile equipment in a cell culture flow cabinet.\n1. Preparations\nPrepare EPDC medium by mixing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM low- glucose) and Medium 199 (M199) in a 1:1 ratio. Add 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, heat inactivated for 25 min at 56 °C) and supplement with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Pre-warm the EPDC medium in a 37 °C water bath.\nPre-warm Trypsin 0.25%/EDTA (1:1) in a 37 °C water bath.\nCoat wells with gelatin. Add 0.1% gelatin/PBS to each well and incubate the plates for at least 15 min at 37 °C. Guidelines for the required cell culture plate are summarized in Table 1. Carefully remove all fluid before plating cells.\nPrepare a stock solution of 10 mM SB431542 (SB), diluted in DMSO (CAUTION). Make 50 µL aliquots in conical bottom polypropylene centrifuge tubes, like Eppendorf tubes, and store them at -20 °C. Note that SB aliquots can be thawed only once.\n2. Retrieval and Storage of Adult and Fetal Heart Specimens\nStore human adult auricles directly upon removal during surgery in a 50-mL tube with 15 mL high-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 4 °C. Samples are generally 3 - 5 cm in size and can be stored up to 48 h after dissection.\nStore fetal hearts obtained from elective abortion material in EPDC medium at 4 °C up to 24 h after isolation. For this protocol, use samples with a gestational age between 12 - 22 weeks. Note that the whole heart can be used for isolation of the epicardium.",
    "3. Isolation of the Epicardial Layer\nIn the laminar flow cabinet, prepare a 100-mm cell-culture dish with PBS and place a separate droplet (~200 µL) of PBS in the lid. Fill a 15-mL tube with 5 mL pre-warmed EPDC medium.\nPlace the tissue in the cell-culture dish filled with PBS. Make sure that the tissue is moistened frequently during the procedure.\nUsing a stereomicroscope, remove as much of the epicardial layer from the tissue sample as possible by peeling it off using forceps.\n\tNote: The epicardium can be recognized as a very thin, transparent layer tightly adhered to the outside of the heart (Figure 1A). Try to avoid contamination with epicardial adipose tissue and blood vessels since this will hamper the isolation.\nCollect pieces of epicardial tissue in the droplet of PBS on the lid.\nCut the epicardial tissue into small pieces (0.5 mm3) using a scalpel (Figure 1B), or using the sharp tips of small forceps.Note that the pieces should be able to pass a P1,000 pipet tip (step 3.6).\nAdd 1 mL of trypsin to the epicardial tissue and collect the pieces and trypsin with a P1,000 pipet tip. Transfer the tissue into a 1.5-mL conical centrifuge tube (Figure 1C).\nIncubate the tube in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min, while shaking at ~60 rpm.\nRemove the tube from the water bath, and clean the outside of the tube with 70% ethanol.\nAllow the tissue to sink to the bottom of the tube (Figure 1D) and carefully transfer the supernatant containing epicardial cells to the 15-mL tube containing 5 mL EPDC medium to inactivate the trypsin.\nReplenish the remaining tissue in the conical centrifuge tube with 1 mL trypsin, and mix by gently pipetting up and down.",
    "Repeat step 3.7 to 3.10 two times. At the final step, after a total of 30 min of trypsin incubation, transfer both the supernatant and the remaining epicardial tissue into the tube containing EPDC medium.\nWhen all cells are collected in EPDC medium, gently pass the suspension through a 10-mL syringe with a 19-gauge needle into a new 15-mL tube to mechanically dissociate the cells (Figure 1E).\n\tNote: Make sure to homogenize the suspension by pipetting up and down before passing the solution through the needle to prevent the needle getting obstructed.\nTo further dissociate the cells, repeat step 3.12 with a 21-gauge needle.\nPlace a 100-µm cell strainer on top of a 50-mL tube and transfer the medium containing the epicardial cells onto the strainer using a 10-mL pipette to remove all remaining clumps (Figure 1F).\nWash the strainer to collect residual cells by pipetting 5 mL EPDC medium onto the strainer.\nPipet the cell suspension from the 50-mL tube into a 15-mL tube. Since cells sink to the bottom of the tube, shake the solution gently before pipetting.\n\tNote: While this step is not necessary, a smaller tube aids visualization of the pellet after centrifugation.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature (Figure 1G).\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet (Figure 1H) in the required volume of EPDC medium (Table 1).\n\tNote: For fetal EPDCs, directly use EPDC medium containing 10 µM of the ALK5 kinase inhibitor (EPDC+SB). Adult cells can be plated without SB during the first passage.\nPlate the cell suspension on the gelatin coated culture plates (Figure 1I). The size of the well depends on the size of the epicardial tissue sample (Table 1). Note that low confluency will induce the occurrence of EMT.",
    "Place the cells in the incubator for at least 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to allow the cells to attach to the culture plate.\n4. Culture of EPDCs\nReplenish the EPDC+SB medium at least every 3 days.\nInspect the cells at least every 3 days using the microscope. When the cells reach confluency, i.e., when the culture plate is fully covered with cells, passage the cells in a 1:2 surface ratio. Note that reaching confluency can take ~5 - 10 days.\n\t\nAspirate the medium using a pipet or an aspiration system with, e.g., a glass pipet.\nWash the cells carefully by adding PBS to the cells. Gently swirl the plate and aspirate the PBS.\nAdd trypsin to the plate. Gently rotate the plate to cover all cells with trypsin and incubate the plate for 1 min at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Use as little trypsin as possible (indication: 200 µL per well of a 6 well plate)\nTap the plate to mechanically detach the cells from the bottom of the plate. Use the microscope to visually check if cells have detached. If not, incubate the cell culture plate for an extra minute.\nAdd the required volume of EPDC+SB medium to the cells, resuspend by pipetting up and down, and transfer the cell suspension to a new gelatin coated culture plate.\n\t\tNOTE: In general, cells can be kept in a cobblestone morphology up to passage 8.\n5. Induction of EMT in EPDCs\nTo induce EMT, dissociate the cells with trypsin and transfer the cells to new gelatin coated wells in a 1:2 surface ratio in EPDC+SB medium, as described in 4, and incubate for at least 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nCheck if confluency is 50 - 70% and if EPDCs have a cobblestone morphology.",
    "NOTE: Confluency affects the ability of EPDCs to undergo EMT.\nAspirate the medium from the cells and wash the cells carefully with PBS (see step 4.2.1 - 4.2.2).\nStimulate cells with 1 ng/mL TGFβ3 in EPDC medium and place them in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 days. Note that during stimulation, the EPDC medium containing TGFβ3 does not have to be replenished.\nMonitor the cells daily. After 5 days, cells that underwent EMT are recognized by a spindle-shaped morphology (Figure 2A).\nCulture spindle-shaped EPDCs according to the method described in 4 without addition of SB or TGFβ to the EPDC medium. Note that in general, spindle-shaped EPDCs can be cultured up to passage 20.\nValidate the occurrence of EMT with immunofluorescent staining using antibodies against the mesenchymal markers αSMA or Vimentin or by phalloidin to detect the formation of F-actin stress fibers (Figure 2B), or using qRT-PCR for EMT-related genes (e.g., WT1, Periostin, Col1A1, αSMA, N-Cadherin, MMP3, Snail, Slug) (Figure 2C and Table 2).\nSubscription Required.
