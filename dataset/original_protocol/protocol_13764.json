  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for the materials needed to assemble the delivery system. Sources of medical air, O2, and NO gases should also be available on site. The device has been developed for investigation use in research protocols that underwent rigorous review by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB). Under no circumstances should providers operate solely based on the indications included in this manuscript, assembling and using this device without seeking prior appropriate institutional regulatory approval. Starting from the proximal end of the device, assemble the pieces in the following order (Figure 1).\n1. Building the patient interface\nTake a snug-fitting, standard, non-invasive ventilation face mask of the appropriate size for the subject.\nConnect the mask's built-in elbow port to a high-efficiency particulate air (highly hydrophobic bacterial/viral filter, HEPA class 13) filter through the 22 mm outer diameter (O.D.)/15 mm inner diameter (I.D.) connector.\n(Optional) To facilitate the subject's movement and reduce the risk of disconnection, add a 15 mm O.D. x 22 mm O.D./15 mm I.D. (length 5 cm-6.5 cm) flexible patient connector for an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube between the mask interface and the HEPA filter.\n\t​NOTE: Make every effort to avoid leakage of the mask interface. The \"patient end\" of the device could also consist of a mouthpiece. A nose clip must be added in such a configuration.\n2. Building the Y-piece and preparation of the O2  supply\nTake a 22 mm to 22 mm and 15 F Y-piece connector with 7.6 mm ports. Create the circuit's expiratory and inspiratory limbs on the two distal ends of the Y-piece through two opposite-sense, low-resistance, 22 mm male/female, one-way valves.\n\t\nExpiratory limb: On one end of the Y-piece, place the one-way valve connector allowing a proximal-to-distal flow only (arrow pointing downward).",
    "Inspiratory limb: On the other end of the Y-piece, connect a one-way valve allowing a distal-to-proximal flow only (arrow pointing upward).\nConnect the proximal end of the Y to the HEPA filter.\nUsing standard, kink-resistant, vinyl gas tubing with universal adaptors at both ends, connect the O2 source to the Y-piece's inspiratory limb. Choose tubing of appropriate length considering the distance between the patient and the source of the gas.\n\t​NOTE: The Y-piece connector must have a sampling port on the inspiratory limb. If not, an additional straight connector with a sampling port must be used to supply O2.\n3. Building and attaching the scavenging chamber\nConnect a 22 mm x 22 mm silicon rubber, flexible connector adapter to the proximal end of a scavenger chamber (internal diameter = 60 mm, internal length = 53 mm, volume = 150mL) containing 100 g of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2).\nAttach a 15 mm O.D. x 22 mm O.D./15 mm I.D., 5 cm-6.5 cm, flexible, corrugated tube to the silicon rubber adapter.\nConnect another 22 mm x 22 mm silicon rubber, flexible connector adapter to the distal end of the scavenger.\nAdd the scavenging chamber and tubing assembly to the Y piece's inspiratory limb using a 15 mm-22 mm two-step adapter.\n4. Building and attaching the NO reservoir system\nAssemble a 3-L latex-free breathing reservoir bag and a 90° ventilator elbow connector without ports (22 mm ID x 22 mm).\nConnect the other end of the elbow to the central opening of the aerosol T-piece (horizontal ports 22 mm O.D., vertical port 11 mm I.D./22 mm O.D.).\nAttach the T-piece to the scavenging chamber's distal end by advancing it until it fits the silicon rubber connector tightly.\n5. Building the NO and medical air supply system",
    "Build the NO/air gas supply system by attaching two consecutive 15 mm O.D. x 15 mm I.D./22 mm O.D. connectors with 7.6 mm sampling ports and flip-top caps.\n\tNOTE: Once the caps are removed, the sampling accesses will function as gas inlet ports.\nAt the distal end of the NO/air supply system, attach another one-way inspiratory valve (arrow pointing upwards).\nAt the proximal end of the NO/air supply system, connect a 15/22 mm two-step adapter.\nConnect the proximal two-step adapter to the remaining free inlet of the green T-piece from the NO reservoir system.\n6. Attach the air and NO gas flow lines by using standard, kink-resistant, star-lumen vinyl oxygen gas tubing for the following steps.\nConnect medical air to the most distal gas inlet port.\nConnect NO gas from an 800 ppm medical-grade NO tank (size AQ aluminum cylinders containing 2239 L of 800 ppm of NO gas at standard temperature and pressure, balanced with nitrogen; delivered volume 2197 L) to the next port downstream.\n\t​NOTE: Tubing must be of appropriate length to reach the gases' sources comfortably. Different tanks or generators of NO can be used as sources of gas.\n7. Use in spontaneously breathing subjects\nSet the air, O2, and NO gas flow according to the desired FiO2 and NO concentration.\n\tNOTE: The recommended flow rates for administering NO at 80, 160, or 250 ppm are listed in Table 1 (applicable to 800 ppm cylinders only).\nPosition the tight-fitting mask on the patient's face, similar to a non-invasive ventilation interface setup.\nStart the inhalation session for the desired duration.\nSubscription Required.
