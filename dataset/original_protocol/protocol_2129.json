    "Template DNAs for IVT are prepared by two rounds of PCR (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Two types of DNA fragments are obtained in the 1st round. One is the DNA containing the translational regulation-target or CaVT gene (hereafter called open reading frames (ORF)) flanked with the partial 5′ and 3′ UTR sequences. The other is the DNA containing the 3′ UTR sequence. In the 2nd round of PCR, these two DNA fragments are fused and the sequences of T7 promoter, 5′ UTR, and poly(A) tail are added. Although the protocol uses PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase, this can be substituted with another high-fidelity PCR enzyme following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol.\n1st round PCR.\nTo amplify the ORF flanked with the partial 5′ and 3′ UTR sequences, prepare the PCR mixtures shown below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1714_1.csv\nTo find appropriate primers and template DNAs, refer to the following list and the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1714_2.csv\nTo amplify DNA containing the 3′ UTR sequence, prepare the PCR mixture shown below. The primer sequences are shown in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1714_3.csv\nPerform the PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/R045A_e.v2102Da.pdf]. A representative example of the PCR condition is shown below. PCR cycling condition\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1714_4.csv\nIn the case of amplifying the ORF-containing DNA, a 20-cycles reaction is usually enough, as the 2nd round PCR needs only a small amount of the DNA.\nAfter the PCR, add 1 μL of DpnI to the PCR mixtures and incubate them at 37°C for 0.5–1.0 h to remove template pDNAs. In the case of a PCR to amplify 3′ UTR, this step can be ignored.",
    "Mix a portion of the PCR mixtures (e.g., 2 μL) with loading dye and perform the electrophoresis using 1.2% agarose gels (100 V 25 min). Then, stain the gels with a gel-staining reagent (e.g., Midori Green Advance) and capture images of gels to confirm the size of the amplified DNAs.\nPurify the amplified DNAs with a DNA purification kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For example, the Monarch PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit[href=https://international.neb.com/protocols/2015/11/23/monarch-pcr-and-dna-cleanup-kit-protocol], but the DNA purification kit of your choice can also be used.\nQuantify the concentration of the purified DNAs by absorbance using a spectrophotometer (a microvolume model such as NanoDrop 2000 is convenient).\n2nd round PCR.\nTo amplify IVT template DNAs containing T7 promoter, 5′ and 3′ UTRs, ORF, and poly(A) tail, prepare the PCR mixtures shown below.

The concentration of purified IVT template DNAs should be higher than 90 ng/μL. If the concentration is too low, increase the PCR reaction volume or reduce the elution volume in the purification step.\nCritical: It is important to confirm the absence of extra bands by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR by-products can be transcribed to unexpected RNAs. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1] if extra bands are observed.\nPreparation of synthetic mRNAs by IVT\nTiming: 8–14 h\nThis step describes the procedure to prepare synthetic mRNAs by in vitro transcription, followed by their dephosphorylation.

Alternatively, other methods (e.g., Denaturing PAGE or Microchip Electrophoresis) could be used to analyze the sample purity and size.\nNote: 2xScMS2(C) mRNA has a highly stable secondary structure, which is hard to denature, and can show two peaks. For the other mRNAs, only a single peak should be observed (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).

Medium containing TMP-HL or TMP without photocage can be used as a positive control. Avoid light irradiation to the photocaged ligands.\nThree hours after the transfection, change the medium to the photocaged ligand-containing one. To avoid decaging of the ligands in the unirradiated control plate, shield the plate from light (e.g., by wrapping the plate with aluminum foil).",
    "Place the cell culture plates directly onto an HP-30LM and irradiate with UV light (wavelength: 365 nm) from the bottom of the plates for 3–7 min. To avoid UV exposure to the experimenters, we recommend doing this procedure in a clean bench equipped with a UV shield. If a UV lamp other than HP-30LM is used for UV light irradiation, the irradiation time should be optimized depending on the light intensity. In the case of HP-30LM, the light intensity measured at the bottom of the plate by a photodiode power sensor was approximately 3.34 mW/cm2.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 1 day.\nAnalyze the gene expression by a method suitable for the gene that is encoded by the transfected mRNA.

Then, suspend the detached cells by adding 500 μL/well of the medium.\nStrain the cells using a cell strainer. Because the cells can aggregate over time, we recommend straining the cells immediately before measuring the fluorescence by flow cytometry.\nMeasure the fluorescence by flow cytometry according to the manufacturer’s instruction.\nNote: Conditions to be tested are listed below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1714_17.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1714_18.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1714_19.csv\nOptional: Analyze the data of the flow cytometry using appropriate software (e.g., FlowJo)."
