  "procedures": [
    "All experimental procedures described were approved by the Administration Committee of Experimental Animals of the Nantong University. Thirty porcine tendons were repaired with three 2-strand repairs: 2-strand core suture, 2-strand core suture plus 2Q, and 2-strand core suture plus running peripheral sutures. The other 30 porcine tendons were repaired with three 4 strand repairs: 4-strand core suture, 4-strand core suture plus 2Q, and 4-strand core suture plus running peripheral sutures.\n1. Preparation of porcine tendons\nPurchase fresh adult pig hind-leg trotters from a slaughtering house. Remove the skin and subcutaneous tissues to expose the pulley and tendon sheath (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: The pulley and tendon sheath are dense in texture, which form an obvious fibro-osseous tunnel for the gliding tendons. The subcutaneous tissues are relatively loose in texture and very easy to be removed.\nIncise the pulley and tendon sheath longitudinally along the central line to expose the flexor tendons (Figure 1B).\nDissect the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon to expose the branches of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons (Figure 1C).\nHarvest the FDP tendons by cutting proximally at about 5 cm to the bifurcation of the FDP tendon and distally at the tendon insertion to the distal phalanx. (Figure 1D).\nWash the tendon samples with clean water and remove the paratenon using surgical scissors.\nCut the tendon along the midline from the end that was proximal to the bifurcation (Figure 1E).\nCut the FDP tendon transversely into 2 stumps at the level that structurally corresponds to the middle part of human zone 2 flexor tendons. The resulting 2 tendon stumps are ready to be repaired (Figure 1F).\n2. Tendon repair",
    "Mark the anterior surface of one of the tendon stumps with 2 points that are 10 mm from the cut tendon end, with each point locating one-fourth of the way from the left (point 1) and the right (point 2), respectively, in the medial-lateral direction (Figure 2A).\nMark each of the left (point 3) and right (point 4) lateral surfaces of the tendon with one point that is 8 mm from the cut tendon end and locate in the middle in the anterior-posterior direction (Figure 2A). Determine all lengths with a Vernier caliper (rated accuracy of 0.02 mm).\nRepair the tendon with 4-0 suture. Insert the needle into the cut surface of one tendon stump from the point that is in the middle in the anterior-posterior direction and one-fourth of the way from the left in the medial-lateral direction (Figure 2B). Pass the needle longitudinally through the tendon and withdraw the needle on the anterior surface of the tendon, exiting from point 1 (Figure 2B).\nRe-insert the needle obliquely from point 3 and pass it transversely toward point 4, creating a small loop at the lateral surface of the tendon (Figure 2C). Pull out the suture and re-insert the needle obliquely from point 2 and pass it longitudinally toward the cut end (Figure 2D,E).\nInsert the needle into the cut end of the other tendon stump and repair it with the same construct, forming a symmetrical repair (Figure 2F).\nTighten the suture with 10% shortening of the tendon segment within the core suture. Tie the tendon ends together with 3 to 4 knots and complete the 2-strand core suture (Figure 2G).\nRepeat the operation once to complete the 4-strand core suture. Do not cut off the first core suture when performing the second core suture.",
    "Insert the same needle into the tendon anterior surface 2 mm away from the joined tendon end and pass through the full thickness of the tendon stump (Figure 3A).\nWithdraw the needle on the posterior surface of the tendon and re-insert the needle into the posterior surface of the tendon 2 mm away from the other side of the joined tendon end (Figure 3B).\nPull out the suture from the anterior surface of the tendon and tie 3 knots to complete 1 Q suture (Figure 3C). Repeat the procedure to complete the second Q suture (Figure 3D).\nIn the 2-strand and 4-strand core suture plus running group, add a running epitendinous suture of 9 to 10 stitches to the tendon ends using 6-0 suture. Keep a similar purchase of 1.5 mm and depth of 1 mm (Figure 3E,F,G).\nKeep the repaired tendon moist by wet gauzes before biomechanical testing.\n3. Software setting\nOpen the testing software and go to the Home screen. Click Method to create a test method. Click New to open the Create a New Test Method dialog box. Select the test type Tension-TestProfile Method and click Create. Click Save As to name and save the test method file.\nOpen the Control-Pre-Test screen in the Method tab by clicking Control | Pre-Test in the navigation bar. Click Preload. Set the control mode as Tensile Extension, the rate as 25 mm/min, the channel as load, and the value as 0.5 N. Enable Auto balance. Add the Available Channels of Tensile strain and Load to the Selected Channels.\nOpen the Control-Test screen in the Method tab and click Edit Profile of the cyclic loading. Insert 4 blocks.",
    "In the first block, set the Mode as Tensile extension, Shape as Triangle, Maximum load as 8 N in the 2-strand repairs and 15 N in the 4-strand repairs, Minimum load as 0 N, Rate as 25 mm/min, and Cycle as 10.\nIn the second block, set the Mode as Tensile extension, Shape as Absolute Ramp, Rate as 25 mm/min, and Endpoint as 8N in the 2-strand repairs and 15 N in the 4-strand repairs.\nIn the third block, set the Mode as Tensile extension, Shape as Hold, Criteria as Duration, and Duration as 8 s.\nIn the fourth block, set the Mode as Tensile extension, Shape as Absolute Ramp, Rate as 25 mm/min, and Endpoint as 100 N. Click Save and Close.\nOpen the Control-End of Test screen in the Method tab. Set Criteria 1 as Rate of Load, and Sensitivity as 40%.\nOpen the Calculation-Setup screen in the Method tab. Select Absolute peak and add to the Selected calculations. Select Load in the drop-down list of Channel. Apply to the 4. Absolute Ramp.\nOpen the Results 1-Columns screen in the Method tab. Select Maximum Load and add Load to the selected results. Click Save and Close.\n4. Biomechanical test\nTurn on the testing machine and the computer that runs the software (Figure 4A). Open the testing software and go to the Home screen (Figure 4A). Set the initial distance between the upper and lower clamps of the testing machine to 5 cm (Figure 4B).\nWrap the tendon with dry gauzes 2–3 cm away from the cut end. Mount the tendon segments wrapped with gauzes into the upper and lower clamps and keep the tendon vertical as much as possible (Figure 4C).",
    "Click Test on the Home screen. Choose the test method file saved in step 3.6 above. Click Next.\nEnter a name and choose a location for the sample data file. Click Next. The Test tab displays. Open Load Cell Setup dialog and click Calibrate to remove load from load cell.\nOpen Control Panel Setup Dialog and select Balance Load in the drop-down list of Key 1 and Reset Gauge Length of Key 2. Click Balance Load and Reset Gauge Length. Click Start to run a test for each specimen in the sample. Record the number of tendon when a 2-mm gap is formed between the 2 ends during the cyclic loading.\nMeasure the gap distance between tendon ends during a pause of 8 s at the maximum load of the 10th cycle (Figure 4D).\nPull the tendon upwards until the repair ruptures and record the ultimate breaking strength (Figure 4E).\nClick Stop, Return, and Finish to save the results.\n5. Statistical Analysis\nPresent data as mean and standard deviation (SD).\nAnalyze data on gap distance and ultimate strength of tendons repaired by different methods using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nPerform multiple comparisons using LSD tests. Set the level of significance at P < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
