    "1. Obtaining Genes of Interest\nDesign synthetic genes.\nOptimize a gene sequence for E. coli expression.\nRemove any problematic restriction sites from the sequence (AvrII, NdeI, EcoRI, and XbaI).\nIncorporate restriction sites for cloning; a 5′-NdeI site and a 3′-EcoRI site are recommended. Other sites can be used, if necessary; refer to the multicloning region of the selected plasmid (Figure S1-S4). If desired, include a 5′ or 3′ encoding tag for Western blot detection.\nCommercially order the designed gene.\nEither blunt clone the gene into a blunt vector using a blunt cloning kit, as per the manufacturer's instructions; design primers to amplify the gene (then proceed to Step 1.2.2); or add additional 5′ and 3′ ends for direct cloning into a pMGX plasmid and proceed to Step 2. Here, the representative results are from blunt cloning the genes of interest.\nAmplify the desired gene (from a designed and optimized synthetic gene or from template DNA containing the desired gene)15.\nDesign primers with restriction sites for cloning; a 5′-NdeI site and a 3′-EcoRI site are recommended. Other sites can be used, if necessary; refer to the multicloning region of the selected plasmid (Figure S1-S4). If desired, include either a 5′ or 3′ encoding tag for Western blot detection.\nPCR amplify the desired gene15.\nAnalyze the PCR by agarose gel electrophoresis16.\nIf there is unspecific amplification, clean up the amplified gene by gel extraction. If not, use an enzyme clean-up kit.\nQuantify the DNA using a spectrophotometer by checking the absorbance at 260 nm; blank with elution buffer17.\n2. Cloning Genes of Interest into a Multigene Expression System Vector, pMGX18\nRestriction digest the obtained gene of interest and the desired vector, pMGX, with NdeI and EcoRI.",
    "NOTE: If a large amount of recircularized plasmids are obtained, allow the NdeI reaction to proceed for 1 h before adding EcoRI.\n\t\nUse a 40 µL digest reaction containing 0.5-1.5 µg of DNA and 1 µL of each enzyme with 4 µL of the appropriate 10x buffer.\nFor an NdeI and EcoRI digest, use EcoRI buffer and first add NdeI endonuclease. Digest for 1 h at 37 °C. Then add EcoRI endonuclease, and allow the digest to proceed for an additional hour. NdeI is sensitive to cleavages close to the end of DNA, so initial digestion by EcoRI can prevent effective digestion by NdeI.\nElectrophorese the restriction digest on agarose gel (for a 1 kb gene, use a 0.7% agarose gel at 110 V for 55 min; to select the percent of agarose gel for differing gene sizes, refer to reference16.\nExcise insert and vector bands using a clean scalpel or razor blade and place the excised gel segment into a 1.5 mL tube.\nExtract DNA from the agarose gel using a gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nLigate the gene of interest into the pMGX vector using a 3:1 insert-to-vector ratio; set up a negative ligation of digested pMGX without the insert.\nSet up a 20 µL ligation reaction containing 1 µL of T4 DNA ligase, 0.15-0.5 µg of vector DNA (~5 µL), and an appropriate amount of insert based on a 3:1 insert-to-vector ratio and the size of the gene being inserted; the pMGX backbones are between 5,312 and 5,504 bp in size. Include a negative control reaction that contains everything but the gene being inserted. Ensure that the amount of vector DNA is equivalent in the negative control ligation and the vector plus insert ligation reactions.",
    "Transform ligation reactions into XL1-Blue chemically competent E. coli cells and ligated plasmids pMGX-yfg1 (containing gene of interest 1), pMGX-yfg2 (containing gene of interest 2) … pMGX-yfgn (containing gene of interest n). Use aseptic technique (inside a biosafety cabinet or under a flame).\nThaw 100 µL aliquots of chemically competent XL1-Blue E. coli on ice for 5 min and then add 5 µL of the ligation reactions. Incubate for 30 min on ice.\nHeat-shock the cells for 45 s in a water bath held at 42 °C and then add 200 µL of cold LB. Incubate them on ice for 2 min.\nShake the cells at 37 °C, 220 rpm for 1 h and then spread plate 100 µL onto an LB-agar plate containing an appropriate selectable marker (either ampicillin or kanamycin).\nScreen the clones for positive transformants.\nCompare the colony counts on the negative control and ligation plates. A colony count ratio greater than 1:2 is desired. If there are a large number of colonies on the negative control plate, go back to Step 2.1 and review the note.\nSelect 4-8 individual colonies (depending on the negative control:ligation ratio) from each ligation reaction of the different genes inserted for screening (1 n) and inoculate a 4 mL LB and the appropriate antibiotic overnight culture/individual colony. Grow cultures overnight with shaking at 37 °C and 220 rpm.\nIsolate plasmid DNA using a plasmid DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.",
    "Set up a 20 µL NdeI + EcoRI digest reaction containing 150-500 ng of DNA and 1 µL of each enzyme with 2 µL of the appropriate 10x buffer. In this case, add NdeI and EcoRI at the same time that the gene of interest will be in between the restriction sites. A negative control with the empty pMGX vector is recommended. Digest for 2 h at 37 °C in a water bath.\n3. Inserting Gene 2 into the pMGX Vector Containing Gene 1, pMGX-yfg1\nRestriction digest pMGX-yfg1 with AvrII and treat with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP).\nUse a 40-µL digest reaction containing 0.5-1.5 µg of vector DNA (~5-10 µL of isolated DNA) and 1 µL of AvrII with 4 µL of the appropriate 10x buffer. Digest for 1.5 h at 37 °C and then add 1.5 µL of CIP. Leave it at 37 °C for an additional 30 min.\nRestriction digest pMGX-yfg2 with AvrII and XbaI to liberate the gene of interest.\nUse a 40 µL digest reaction containing 0.5-1.5 µg of DNA and 1 µL of each enzyme with 4 µL of the appropriate10x buffer. Digest for 2 h at 37 °C.\nElectrophorese restriction digests on an appropriate percent (0.7%) agarose gel and excise the insert and vector bands using a clean scalpel/razor blade (refer to Steps 2.2-2.3).\nExtract the DNA using a gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantify the DNA17.\nLigate gene 2 into pMGX-yfg1 using a 3:1 insert-to-vector ratio. Set up a negative ligation of digested pMGX-yfg1 without the additional insert. Set up as above in Step 2.5.\nTransform 5 µL of the ligation reactions into XL1-Blue chemically competent E. coli cells, ligated plasmids pMGX-yfg1,2 (containing gene of interest 1 and 2), and negative pMGX-yfg1 control, as seen in Step 2.6.",
    "Compare the colony count on the negative control and ligation plates. A colony count ratio greater than 1:2 is desired. If there are a large number of colonies on the negative control plate, go back to Step 3.1 and review the CIP treatment.\nSelect 4-8 individual colonies (depending on the negative control:ligation ratio) from the ligation reaction and inoculate 4 mL of LB plus the appropriate antibiotic per individual colony and grow overnight at 37 °C and 220 rpm.\nIsolate plasmid DNA using a plasmid DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantify the DNA17.\nScreen the effective insertion of the second gene by performing a restriction digest of pMGX-yfg1,2 with EcoRI.\nUse a 20 µL digest reaction containing 150-500 ng of DNA and 1 µL of EcoRI enzyme with 2 µL of EcoRI 10x buffer. Digest for 2 h at 37 °C.\nElectrophorese the restriction digest on an appropriate percent agarose gel; look for a band that corresponds to the size of gene 2 (see Step 2.2). A gene may insert into the vector in the undesired, reversed orientation.\n4. Adding a Third Gene into the pMGX Vector Containing Genes 1 and 2, pMGX-yfg1,2\nRestriction digest pMGX-yfg1,2 with AvrII and treat with CIP, as seen in Step 3.1.\nRestriction digest pMGX-yfg3 with AvrII and XbaI, as seen in Step 3.2.\nElectrophorese the restriction digests on an appropriate percent agarose gel and excise insert and vector bands using a clean scalpel/razor blade; refer to Steps 2.2-2.3.\nExtract the DNA from the agarose gel using a gel extraction kit and quantify the DNA17.\nLigate gene 3 into pMGX-yfg1,2 using a 3:1 insert-to-vector ratio and set up a negative ligation of digested pMGX-yfg1,2 without an additional insert, as seen in Step 3.5.",
    "Transform 5 µL of the ligation reactions into XL1-Blue chemically competent E. coli cells, ligated plasmid pMGX-yfg1,2,3 (containing genes of interest 1, 2, and 3), and negative pMGX-yfg1,2 control, as seen in Step 2.6.\nCompare the colony count on the negative control and ligation plates. If there are a large number of colonies on the negative control plate, go back to Step 4.1 and review the CIP treatment.\nSelect 4-8 individual colonies (depending on the negative control:ligation ratio) from the ligation reaction and inoculate 4 mL of LB plus the appropriate antibiotic per individual colony; grow overnight at 37 °C and 220 rpm.\nIsolate the plasmid DNA using a plasmid DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nScreen the effective insertion of the third gene by performing a restriction digest of pMGX-yfg1,2,3 with EcoRI, as seen in Step 3.10.\nElectrophorese the restriction digest on an appropriate percent agarose gel; look for bands that correspond to the sizes of gene 2 and gene 3 (see Step 2.2). Note: gene 3 may insert into the vector in the undesired, reversed orientation. If genes 2 and 3 are the same size, another appropriate restriction digest site must be selected for screening.\n\tNOTE: Repeat as needed for each new gene.\n5. Producing Proteins of Interest Using a Multigene Expression System and Assessing Production by Western Blotting\nTransform the positive clone containing all genes of interest into chemically competent, protein-production E. coli, such as BL21-(λDE3).\nThaw 100 µL aliquots of chemically competent BL21-(λDE3) E. coli on ice for 5 min and then add 1 µL of the positive cloned plasmid DNA; incubate for 30 min on ice.",
    "Heat shock the cells for 45 s in a water bath held at 42 °C and then add 200 µL of cold LB. Incubate on ice for 2 min.\nShake the cells at 37 °C and 220 rpm for 1 h and then spread plate 100 µL onto an LB-agar plate containing the appropriate selectable marker (either ampicillin or kanamycin).\nExpress the protein by isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction.\nSelect an isolated colony from the B21-(λDE3) transformation plate and inoculate 4 mL of LB plus the appropriate antibiotic; grow overnight, shaking at 37 °C and 220 rpm.\nInoculate a 100 mL LB plus the appropriate antibiotic culture using 1 mL of overnight culture.\nGrow at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm to an OD600 of 0.6.\nInduce the culture with 100 µM IPTG and grow for 15 h at 25 °C and 220 rpm.\nRemove 1 mL of the culture and centrifuge it at 13,000 x g for 1 min; discard the supernatant.\nLyse the cells using lysis solution as per the manufacturer's instructions and preform a Western blot of the soluble cell lysate to determine if all proteins were successfully produced19.\nSubscription Required.
