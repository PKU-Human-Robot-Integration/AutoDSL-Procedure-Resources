    "All methods described in this protocol have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of National Jewish Health.\nNOTE: The protocol is organized into three components. The first component details the construction of the air-inflation with perfusion/fixation equipment. A second section describes how to set up the equipment for an experiment. The final section describes how to prepare the animal and perform the experiment.\n1. Construction of the water column apparatus (Figure 1B)\nRemove the plunger from a 60 mL slip tip syringe.\nAttach tape around the syringe at the 30 mL mark. Set the height of the syringe to this mark for the initial inflation pressure of 25 cmH2O. This is also where the water level in the column should be throughout the entire procedure. Label the tape either as \"25 cm\" (as depicted in Figure 1A) or \"inflation\".\n\tNOTE: An inflation pressure of 25 cmH2O is used to ensure recruitment of collapsed airspaces. Once alveoli have been recruited, the pressure is lowered to 20 cmH2O to ensure that the airspaces are not distended.\nMeasure 5 cm from the tape towards the plunger end and attach another piece of tape to the syringe. Move the syringe down to this mark to lower the inflation pressure to 20 cmH2O during fixation. Label the tape either as \"20 cm\" (as depicted in Figure 1A) or \"fixation\".\nAttach 180 polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing to the slip tip end of the syringe. The length of tubing is dependent upon the distance between the syringe and air inflation chamber (approximately 25-30 cm).",
    "Place a male Luer (2) thread style tee (1.219 inches length, 0.904 inches height, 0.0904 inches inner diameter) into the other end of the tubing. This male Luer will connect to the stopcock of the air-inflation chamber (Step 2.4).\n2. Construction of the air-inflation chamber (Figure 1C)\nDrill two holes (approximately 4 mm in diameter) in a 500 mL plastic container with a screw-on cap. The holes should be the same size as the female Luers (1.224 inches length, 0.312 inches height, 0.098 inches inner diameter).\n\tNOTE: Empty media or buffer containers can be utilized for the air-inflation chamber.\nCoat threads of female Luers with silicone gasket maker and place the smaller side into the pre-drilled holes of the container.\nAdd silicone gasket maker around the female Luers where they enter the container to ensure an air-tight seal.\nScrew on a one-way stopcock on the lower female Luer on the air-inflation chamber.\nCut tubing to the length of roughly 25 cm and attach male Luers to the free ends of the tubing. Connect the male Luer on one end of the tubing to the free female Luer on the air-inflation chamber. The other male Luer will connect to the animal-processing container.\n3. Construction of the animal-processing container (Figure 1D)\nDrill a hole (approximately 4 mm diameter) in the side of a large plastic container. The hole should be the diameter of the female Luer. The plastic container is needed to catch excess fixation solution.\n\tNOTE: A 30 cm x 22 cm, 3.8 L plastic storage container was used.\nCoat threads of a female Luer with a silicone gasket maker and place the smaller side into the predrilled hole of the container.",
    "Add silicone gasket maker around the female Luer where it enters and exits the container to ensure an air-tight seal.\nScrew a one-way stopcock onto the female Luer. Tubing from the air-inflation chamber will attach to this stopcock.\n4. Preparation of solutions\nHeparin solution\n\t\nFill a container with calcium-free PBS and heparin (20 U/mL). Prepare a total of 10 mL heparin solution for each mouse. Heparin is an anti-coagulant that prevents blood clots from forming in the vessels during perfusion-fixation. Heparin solution will be used to flush blood from the lungs prior to perfusion-fixation.\nFixative solution\n\tCAUTION: Fixatives can present a health hazard and should be used in a chemical fume hood. All apparatuses are set up in a chemical fume hood to prevent inhalation of fixatives.\n\t\nFill a container with calcium-free PBS and paraformaldehyde (4% final concentration). Prepare a total of 50 mL fixative solution for each mouse.\n\t\t​NOTE: The type of fixative used may vary and will depend upon downstream histologic studies.\n5. Preparation of perfusion apparatus\nNOTE: A peristaltic pump is suggested for delivery of fluids into vasculature to ensure constant flow rate. The following directions are for setting up the peristaltic pump and may be different for each model. Alternatively, if a peristaltic pump is unavailable, a second water column apparatus may be constructed to perfuse fluids from a height of 35 cm H2O.\nFirst place the tubing around the roller assembly.\nSecure the tubing into the notched posts.\nLatch the levers into place by first placing the left lever around the tubing and securing it in place with the top and then the right lever.\nPlace the proximal end of the tubing into the heparin solution and the distal end into the animal processing container.",
    "Preload heparin solution into the tubing by running the pump to expel air from the tubing.\nSecure a 25G x 5/8\" needle onto the end of the left side of the tubing.\n6. Preparation of air-inflation apparatus\nPlace the syringe for the water column into a ring holder.\nMeasure a vertical height of 25 cm from the animal platform to the \"25 cm\" tape mark (Step 1.2) on the water column.\nAttach the end of the water column's tube to the stopcock on the air chamber.\nAttach a tube from the female Luer of the air chamber to the stopcock on the animal processing container.\n\tNOTE: If the air-inflation chamber is constructed as depicted in Figure 1C, attaching tubing in reverse order may cause water to leak into the tubing that connects to the tracheal cannula.\nEnsure that the cap to the air chamber is tightly closed.\nEnsure that the stopcock on the outside of the animal processing container is closed and the stopcock on the tubing leading from the water column to the air-inflation chamber is open.\nFill the syringe with water to the \"25 cm\" mark. Water will leave the syringe through the tubing into the air chamber. Once pressure is equalized water will stop flowing.\n\t\nIt is possible that water will slowly leak into the air-inflation chamber as ambient air pressure within the chemical hood fluctuates. Keep an eye on the water level within the syringe and add more if necessary. Maintain the water level at the \"25 cm\" mark throughout the procedure.",
    "NOTE: Usually water levels will stay consistent for the first part of air inflation at 25 cmH2O; however more water will likely need to be added to the syringe during fixation. If the water does not stop flowing, it is likely that an air leak exists within the air-inflation chamber. More silicone gasket maker may need to be applied around the Luers to prevent air leaks.\n7. Preparation of animals (Figure 2)\nNOTE: This procedure has been modified from Gage et al13. We have completed this procedure on adult male and female mice of varying ages and note no age or sex bias.\nEuthanize the animal with sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneally.). Ensure that the animal is dead prior to beginning dissection.\n\tNOTE: While this procedure is performed on euthanized animals, this procedure can be performed on live animals to utilize the heart to pump perfusates throughout the animal.\nMake two lateral incisions through the abdominal wall. Make the first incision below the rib cage and the second above the hips. Cut along the midline from the inferior incision towards the superior incision.\nUsing blunt scissors, carefully make an incision into the lateral side of the diaphragm. The lungs should collapse as soon as the diaphragm is punctured.\n\tNOTE: Care must be taken to avoid puncturing the lungs. A punctured lung is less likely to inflate during later steps.\nCut transversely along the diaphragm to open the thoracic cavity.\nCut superiorly along the sternum from the xiphoid process to the jugular notch and laterally above the rib cage to fully expose the heart and lungs. Pin down the sides of the ribcage.\nMake a midline incision in the neck above the trachea. Remove skin, muscle, thyroid gland and connective tissue surrounding the trachea.",
    "Using curved forceps, slide two pieces of thread or suture under the posterior trachea. Use one piece of suture to hold the inflation Luer-stub adapter in place, and use the other ultimately to tie off the trachea at the conclusion of air-inflation and vascular perfusion-fixation.\nPoke a small hole in the trachea using an 18G x 1\" needle or Vannas spring scissors.\nPlace a 20G Luer-stub adapter into this hole in the trachea.\nTie one thread around the trachea immediately distal to where the Luer-stub adapter enters to hold it in place.\nTransfer the animal to the animal processing container.\nAttach the Luer-stub adapter to the female Luer on the inside of the animal processing container.\n8. Air inflation, perfusion and fixation of the lungs (Figure 2)\nPlace the 25G x 5/8\" needle attached to the perfusion apparatus tubing into the right ventricle of the heart.\nCut the abdominal aorta to allow blood to drain from the heart and to promote flow of perfusate through the lungs.\nOpen the stopcock on the outside of the animal processing container to inflate the lungs.\n\tNOTE: It may take time for the lungs to fully inflate. Watch the water level in the syringe, it should not decrease rapidly unless there is a leak in the lungs.\nInflate the lungs at 25 cmH2O for 5 minutes. Inflation at 25 cmH2O preconditions the lung and assists in recruiting atelectatic lung regions.\n\t​NOTE: A small amount of water may need to be added to the syringe to maintain the 25 cm height. Inflammation and/or experimentally induced lung injury may influence inflation of the lungs. In this case, it may be necessary to increase the inflation pressure up to a maximum of 35 cmH2O to assist in recruiting atelectatic regions.",
    "During the last minute of the lung inflation, turn on the peristaltic pump to a flow rate of 10 mL/min. Heparin solution should flow from the bottle through the tubing into the animal.\n\t\nThe goal of heparin infusion is to prevent formation of thrombi in the vessels. Accordingly, infuse heparin until the lungs become white and are devoid of blood. If the lungs do not turn white, adjustment of the right ventricular needle may be necessary.\nAfter inflating for 5 minutes, turn off the peristaltic pump and switch the perfusion tubing from the heparin solution to the fixative.\nLower the water column syringe to the \"20 cm\" mark (Step 1.3). It is normal for air bubbles to move within the water column as the pressure changes from 25 to 20 cmH2O.\n\t\nCheck the water level in the syringe. It should be at the \"25 cm\" mark. It may be necessary to add more at this time.\nWait for 1 min to allow the lungs to deflate from 25 to 20 cmH2O.\nRestart the perfusion pump at a flow rate of 6.5 mL/min.\nVascular perfusion-fix for 10 - 15 minutes.\n9. Extraction of lungs (Figure 3)\nTightly tie the second piece of thread around the trachea distal to the Luer-stub adapter. Remove the Luer-stub adapter from the trachea.\nRemove the needle from the heart.\nFree the lungs and heart from the thoracic cavity by cutting the connective tissue posterior to the mediastinum with blunt scissors. Take care to avoid puncturing the lungs.\nCarefully remove the heart from the lungs.\nPlace the lungs in fixative overnight.\n\t​NOTE: Duration of fixative varies depends on downstream histologic studies.",
    "Place the lungs into a 50 mL conical tube containing 20-25 mL of fixative. Place the thread securing the trachea through the opening of the conical tube and secure by the threads of the cap. Invert the conical tube to ensure that the buoyant, air-inflated lungs remain fully submerged in fixative otherwise they will float to the top of the liquid.\nProcess the lungs for histologic studies.\nSubscription Required.
