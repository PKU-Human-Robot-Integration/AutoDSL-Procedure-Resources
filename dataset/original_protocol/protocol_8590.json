    "The protocol below describes the preparation of C57BL/6 and C3H/He (retinally degenerate) mouse neuronal tissue, but similar techniques can be applied to other species. All animals were healthy and handled with standard conditions of temperature, humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle, free access to food and water, and without any intended stress stimuli. All experiments were approved and performed in accordance with Western Sydney University Animal Care and Ethics committee and according to the animal use and care guidelines (Animal Research Authority #A9452, #A10396 and #A8967).\n1. Brain Slice Preparation\nAnesthetize the animal by inhalation of isoflurane (5%) and decapitate using a rodent guillotine. Remove the brain quickly, as described previously9 and place it into ice-cold physiological solution (aCSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 25 dextrose, and saturated with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2 mixture; 310 mOsm; pH 7.4).\nCut brain slices, in the region of interest, 300 µm thick with a vibrating microtome.\nTransfer slices to a custom built incubation system that closely monitors and controls pH levels (pH 7.2 - 7.4), carbogen flow, and temperature as previously described10,11.\nSet initial chamber temperature to 35 °C for 15 - 30 min, and then slowly reduce to 15 - 16 °C as shown in Figure 1C. Then incubate slices in the incubation system until needed, either for electrophysiology or imaging.\n\tNOTE: If slices are to be used for calcium-imaging, follow steps below before cooling tissue below RT.\n2. Retinal Wholemount Preparation and Inner Limiting Membrane Removal\nPrepare retinal wholemounts under either normal laboratory lighting conditions or dim red/infra-red light.",
    "Euthanize animal by cervical dislocation and immediately enucleate eyes. Make a small cut along the ora serrata, and place in either Ames media, or aCSF containing (mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 0.5 L-glutamine, and saturate with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2 mixture; ~300 mOsm; pH 7.4), at RT.\nImmediately remove the cornea, lens and vitreous by cutting along the ora serrata with small scissors and removing the lens and vitreous with forceps. Place tissue in the incubation system at RT.\n\tNOTE: Retinal tissue can be maintained in the eye-cup, after slow temperature reduction to 15 - 16 °C, for >24 h in the incubation system until needed.\nTo remove the ILM, transfer the eye-cup containing the retina to a small glass jar containing 30 U/mL papain, 1 mM L-cystine, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.005% DNase in Earl's-Balanced Salt Solution (BSS) at 37 °C for 20 min. Apply 95% O2/5% CO2 to the solution through the lid but do not bubble. If using tissue from young animals (<6 weeks), dilute the solution to half-strength.\n\t\nStop enzymatic digestion, by placing the tissue in an ovomucoid (10 mg/mL) and BSA (10 mg/mL) solution for 10 min in Earl's BSS. Wash tissue thoroughly with aCSF before transfer to the incubation system and reduce temperature to 15 - 16 °C.\nMaintain retinal tissue in the eye-cup until needed. For transfer to the microscope, isolate the retina from the eye-cup and cut into 4 pieces with a razorblade. If the entire retina is required, make four small cuts in the periphery of the retina to allow it to lie flat.\n\tNOTE: For imaging experiments, load with calcium-dyes before transfer to the incubation system, see below.\n3. Maintaining Tissue in the Incubator",
    "Place tissue in the main chamber containing probes for pH and temperature measurements (Figure 1A, B).\nCirculate aCSF through a second chamber (UVC chamber, built as previously described12) isolated from the main chamber and exposed to 1.1 W UVC light (254 nm, 5W/2P sterilizer UV lamp) in order to eradiate bacteria floating in the solution (Figure 1A). Control UVC light timing via a programmable timer using a random feature that turns ON at times varying between 15 and 26 min every 15 - 30 min to avoid excessive heating of the aCSF.\nSet the flow rate in the UVC chamber to 12 mL/min as previously reported12. Cover the UVC chamber with aluminum foil to prevent UVC illumination outside the chamber, which can damage neuronal tissue.\n\tNOTE: For dark-adapted retinal tissue, apply a custom-made cover to the main chamber to exclude light.\nUse a peristaltic pump to circulate the solution (aCSF) through the two chambers and a Peltier thermoelectric cold plate cooler to either cool or heat the main chamber to the desired temperatures in the range of 0 - 50 °C. For optimal tissue incubation, use 15 - 16 °C for long-term viability.\n4. Calcium Dye Loading\nSelect calcium dyes based on the preference of the individual researcher. Here we use Fura-2AM, Fluo-8AM or Fluo-4AM. However, this method can be applied to other dyes as well: dissolve calcium dyes in DMSO to a 1 mM solution and 1% block copolymers (e.g., pluronic acid-127) to a final volume of 50 µL and sonicate for 10 min.",
    "Add solution to aCSF to a final concentration of 10 µM, 0.01% block copolymers for brain slices, and 20 µM (retina), 0.02% block copolymers for the retina. In retinae (papain treated) and brain slices from young animals, load to the bath for 45 min at 37 °C (Fura-2 AM) or at RT (Fluo-4 AM; Fluo-8 AM).\n\t\nFor adult animals, (>12 weeks) pipette the dyes (50 µL) directly onto the brain slices, and maintain for 75 min to allow better penetration of the dye into the deep layers.\nTo ensure adequate oxygenation of the submerged slice during dye incubation, prepare a glass loading chamber with a closed lid (circular jar of diameter 2.5 cm, 3.5 cm height) with calcium dyes diluted in 2.5 mL of aCSF. Oxygenate continuously with 95% O2/5% CO2. Do not bubble.\nFollowing dye loading, wash the tissue with aCSF and transfer to the incubation system, slowly reduce the temperature to 15 - 16 °C until experimental use.\n5. Electrophysiological Recordings and Imaging\nPlace tissue in a submerged recording chamber under a microscope, and perfuse with oxygenated aCSF at a flow rate of 4 - 5 mL/min either at RT (~22 °C) or physiological temperature (~35 °C). Hold the tissue in place by using a custom made ''harp'', made of nylon or gold threads stretched and glued across a U-shaped piece of gold or platinum wire.\nFor electrophysiology:\n\t\nPrepare recording pipettes from 1.5 mm (1.19 mm ID) borosilicate glass using a micropipette puller to achieve a final resistance of 5-6 MΩ.\nFill the pipette with 3 - 4 µL of internal solution as previously described13 and visualize cells under infrared Differential Interference Contrast (IR-DIC) using a CCD camera. The intracellular solution should be carefully tailored to each experiment to achieve experimental outcomes.",
    "Position pipette, while maintaining positive pressure applied through a suction port on the pipette holder, on the membrane of a cell using a micromanipulator. Since the ILM has been removed from the retina, no prior membrane scraping is required. Once the pipette is on the cell, apply gentle negative pressure to the pipette to achieve a gigaohm seal. Then rupture the cell membrane with a brief amount of negative pressure.\nMake whole-cell current- or voltage-clamp recordings using standard techniques as appropriate.\nCalcium-imaging:\n\t\nFor ratiometric imaging of Fura-2, use an ultra-high speed wavelength switcher to provide excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm. Pass emitted light from individual cells through an emission filter of 510 ±20 nm, and capture with a high sensitivity, high-speed digital camera.\nFor a single excitation wavelength of Fluo-4, filter excitation light through a 460 - 490 nm band pass filter and emitted light through a 515 - 550 nm band pass filter. For the fastest and most sensitive recording use a high speed digital camera such. Acquire images as required.\nMeasure alterations in fluorescence as a function of time either at a single wavelength (Fluo-4) or using the wavelength ratio method (Fura-2), as previously described8,14.\nSubscription Required.
