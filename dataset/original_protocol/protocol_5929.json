    "Preparation and culture of P. sojae for secreted proteinP. sojae strain P6497 was grown in sterilized 10% V8 juice with 2% agar medium at 25 °C in the Constant Temperature incubator (CTI) under dark conditions for 4 days (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015211606_9861.jpgFigure 1. P. sojae colony grown on V8 plates for 4 daysFor secreted proteins production, cut P. sojae grown on V8 plates into 3 mm x 3 mm discs with a sterilized scalpel. Transfer twenty P. sojae discs into 1 L synthesis liquid medium and incubate on the Constant temperature shaker (CTS) (25 °C, 100 rpm) for 10 days (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015211625_7814.jpgFigure 2. P. sojae cultured in synthesis liquid medium for 10 days Extraction and collection of secreted protein from medium by P. sojae Collect P. sojae culture fluid by centrifugation at 1,200 x g for 20 min and ﬁlter through two layers of Whatman ﬁlters (No. 1) and then a 0.22 μm Millex-GV filter. Add 70 g of (NH4)2SO4 per 100 ml filtrate for precipitation and incubate for 12 h at 4 °C.Dissolve the precipitate in 4 ml TE buffer.Chromatographic puriﬁcation and isolation of extracts secreted by P. sojae (see the Video 1)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

(The absorption peaks stand for the line of UV280 on the screen of AKTA, Figure 3)Gel filtration sieving chromatographyCollect the eluted samples from Sephadex G-25S and subsequently inject into TE buffer-equilibrated SuperdexTM 200 Increase chromatography column.",
    "Collect the fractions corresponding to each absorbance peak respectively, and then desalt and concentrate using 3-kD molecular mass centrifugal ﬁlter devices (see Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit 3-kD manual).SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions corresponding to each absorbance peakLoad the concentrated protein (20 μl about 100 μg/ml) into 10% SDS-PAGE gel and subject to electrophoresis for 1 h in 100 V. Stain the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue overnight and then destain for 3 h at room temperature.Separation and elution of protein in SDS-PAGE GelFor the fractions showing more than one band after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining in the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 3), cut each protein band from gel and into 2-mm segments. Dry it (remove the water with Filter paper). After drying, dissolve these segments in 0.1 ml 0.1% SDS (pH 6) and incubate at 70 °C for 1 h and then 37 °C overnight. Collect the supernatant by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181015/20181015211643_2093.jpgFigure 3. SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein fractions. A. Absorbance peaks corresponding to the fractions in B, respectively. B. Fractions of secreted protein show on SDS-PAGE gel after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.Identification of secreted protein by mass spectrometryAnalyze the collected supernatant by LC-MS/MS as described before (Wang et al., 2003; Ma et al., 2015). Proteins matched with peptides identified by mass spectrometry are used for further research. Note: For further analysis of these proteins, they were expressed in Pichia pastoris (Km71) using the pPIZ9k vector or Escherichia coli (Rosetta) using pET32a."
