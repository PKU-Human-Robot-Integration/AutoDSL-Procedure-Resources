    "A few clinical trials using this 64Cu PET/CT or PET/MRI protocol have been approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Region Midt, Denmark [1-10-72-196-16 (EudraCT 2016-001975-59), 1-10-72-41-19 (EudraCT 2019-000905-57), 1-10-72-343-20 (EudraCT 2020-005832-31), 1-10-72-25-21 (EudraCT 2021-000102-25), and 1-10-72-15-22 (EudraCT 2021-005464-21)]. Written informed consent was obtained from the participants at enrollment. The inclusion criteria for all participants were age >18, and for females the use of safe contraception. The exclusion criteria for Wilson disease patients were decompensated cirrhosis, a Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score >11, or a modified Nazer score >6. The exclusion criteria for all participants were a known hypersensitivity to 64Cu or other ingredients in the tracer formula, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or a desire to become pregnant before the end of the trial.\n1. Preparation of 64CuCl2\nDissolve solid 64CuCl2 in hydrochloric acid (0.1 M) and add sodium acetate buffer (0.5 M) to increase the pH to ~5. Formulate with saline and filter sterilize the solution by passing it through a 0.22 µm filter (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Sodium acetate buffer (0.5 M) is produced from sodium acetate trihydrate and sterile water that is passed through a 0.22 µm sterilizing filter.\nFor quality control of the produced 64CuCl2 solution, perform pH measurement, bacterial endotoxin testing, radiochemical purity determination, and radio nuclidic identification7,8.\nStore the product in a lead container at room temperature and keep it in quarantine until all quality control specifications have been satisfactorily met.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, 64CuCl2 was produced with a radio nuclidic purity ≥99% and a radiochemical purity ≥95%. Solid 64CuCl2, used as starting material, was obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n2. Preparation of PET scanner\nPerform a quality check (QC)9 on the scanner, following the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: QCs must be performed daily in the morning before patient scans.\n3. Drawing of tracer for intravenous (IV) injection and per oral (PO) administration\nWear plastic gloves and remove the lid from the lead container.\nUse long tweezers to disinfect the rubber membrane of the tracer-containing glass bottle inside the lead container with a disinfection swab.\nUse tweezers to insert a short cannula (~0.5 mm x 16 mm) into the membrane to avoid spill-over from the vacuum inside the bottle.\nUse tweezers to insert a longer cannula to draw from. This cannula should be long enough to reach the bottom of the bottle (usually 50 mm).\nEnsure that the dose calibrator (see Table of Materials) is calibrated for 64Cu. Calculate an approximate volume to draw for the first draw.\n\tNOTE: From the chemical quality control reports, the activity amount and volume of the liquid will be available, allowing for the calculation of an approximate volume to draw.\nWear plastic gloves, insert an appropriately sized plastic syringe into the long cannula, and draw the calculated volume. This volume will depend on the concentration of 64Cu in the product and how much 64Cu is decided for the protocol (see Dose calculations under the representative results).\nUse tweezers to hold the cannula while moving the syringe to the dose calibrator to measure the radioactivity.\nKeep drawing until the appropriate radioactivity amount is reached. Approximately 5% of the tracer will remain in the syringe and cannula after injection.\n\tNOTE: The 64Cu should not be diluted in salt water, as the tracer may precipitate. Thus, the syringe cannot be rinsed with saline water after the injection (this is not relevant for PO administration).",
    "With the tweezers, apply a cannula with a cap (~16 mm cannula) to close the syringe and store it in a lead container until application.\n4. Application of the tracer\nIV injection\n\t\nInsert an intravenous cannula (~22 G, 25 mm), preferably in a cubital vein, and rinse with saline water to ensure correct placement.\n\t\tNOTE: A worksheet with the participant's name, a stamp or signature for tracer quality control release, and time points and radioactivity for drawing, injection, and leftover tracer should be available.\nMeasure the radioactivity in the syringe using the dose calibrator available and note the time and activity on the worksheet.\nTransport the syringe in a lead container to the participant's bedside.\nIf any spill-over occurs from the injection, place a napkin under the participant's elbow so the spilled radioactivity can be measured.\nWith tweezers, remove the cap/cannula from the syringe, and with plastic gloves, connect the syringe to the IV access. Note the time on the worksheet and inject in one steady movement.\n\t\tNOTE: As mentioned earlier, the syringe should not be rinsed with saline as the tracer may precipitate.\nRemove the syringe from the IV access, put on the cap/cannula, and place it in the lead container with the napkin if necessary.\nRinse the IV access through with saline water.\nNote the time and leftover radioactivity in the syringe on the worksheet.\n\t\tNOTE: The injected activity is calculated as the difference between the syringe activity before and after injection, but using the PET scan protocol to correct for decay. Thus, all three time points (draw, injection, and leftover measurements) and the measured radioactivity at the draw and leftover measurements are entered into the PET scan protocol when the participant is scanned (see step 5).\nDispose of the leftover material appropriately, according to institutional safety regulations.",
    "Remove the IV access. In case any allergic reactions appear, leave the IV access in for 30 min.\nOral administration\n\tNOTE: A worksheet with the participant's name, a stamp or signature for tracer quality control release, and time points and radioactivity for drawing, administration, and leftover tracer should be available.\n\t\nIn a disposable and soft plastic cup, pour around 100 mL of water or cordial; the 64Cu is tasteless. A disposable plastic straw and a small disposable plastic bag should be available.\nMeasure the radioactivity in the syringe using the dose calibrator available and note the time and activity on the worksheet.\nTransport the syringe in a lead container to the participant's bedside. The participant should be seated in a bed or chair.\nRemove the cap/cannula from the syringe with tweezers and, wearing plastic gloves, inject the tracer into the cup, being careful not to spill any. Draw up a bit of the water/cordial and inject it into the cup again.\nPlace a plastic straw in the cup (this is to minimize the risk of spill-over when the participant drinks).\nNote the time on the worksheet and let the participant drink. The cup should be as empty as possible.\nPut the empty cup and straw in the disposable plastic bag with the empty syringe and place them in the lead container.\nNote the time and measure the leftover radioactivity in the syringe. Note in the worksheet.\n\t\tNOTE: The injected activity is calculated as the difference between the syringe activity before and after injection, but using the PET scan protocol to correct for decay. Thus, all three time points (draw, injection, and leftover measurements) and the measured radioactivity at the draw and leftover measurement are entered into the PET scan protocol when the participant is scanned (see Scan).",
    "Dispose of the leftover material appropriately, according to institutional safety regulations.\n\t\tNOTE: Observing the participant for acute allergic reactions for 30 min after the intake may be appropriate.\n5. PET scans\nPlace the participant in a supine position in the scanner.\nPerform overview CT or MR scanning to plan the specific region to be examined during the PET scan.\nNote the time of the draw, injection, and leftover measurement, and the radioactivity at the draw and leftover measurement in the PET protocol.\nPerform PET scanning following the steps below.\n\tNOTE: The PET scan protocol must be standardized with regard to scan duration and image reconstruction parameters for all participants in the same study; published reports should be followed10,11,12.\n\t\nPerform static PET scans with a scan time of 4.5 min/bed position for up to 24 h after tracer administration, and 10 min/bed position for up to 68 h after tracer administration (for further elaboration, see Scan under the representative results).\n\t\tNOTE: During dynamic PET scanning, decay is continuously recorded and subsequently segmented into a frame structure. This allows for selection of frames from short time intervals to emphasize the dynamics of 64Cu distribution, and frames from longer time intervals to prioritize sensitivity. Typically, shorter intervals are selected right after injection and gradually increased thereafter10.\n6. Image reconstruction\nReconstruct the images using the best available corrections for attenuation, scatter, time-of-flight, and point-spread function.\n\tNOTE: The image reconstruction parameters must be carefully selected to optimize the image properties, such as signal recovery and signal-to-noise. For multicenter studies, it is critical to standardize the image quality between centers.\n7. Data analysis",
    "NOTE: The present study describes a simple method to quantify 64Cu content in the liver. The PET signal is measured as standard uptake value (SUV), the tissue radioactivity concentration adjusted for participant weight injected activity and/or kilobecquerel (kBq) per mL of tissue.\nDownload data to a suitable program, for example, Dicom files, to PMOD.\n\tNOTE: There are likely many different programs to analyze PET images, such as Hermes or PMOD (see Table of Materials).\nAdjust the CT/MR scan tones to differentiate the anatomical structures.\nEnsure that the anatomical scan and PET scan are overlapping.\nWorking in the horizontal plane with the best MRI or CT scan, localize the liver and the big structures.\nPlace an appropriate volume of interest (VOI) or multiple VOIs in the liver.\n\tNOTE: A VOI is a defined area of tissue where the SUV is measured. A VOI consists of multiple regions of interest (ROIs), which are tissue areas in one plane. Many programs have spherical VOIs as a pre-setting, meaning multiple ROIs (one in each plane) do not have to be drawn to constitute a VOI. The right liver lobe tends to be more homogenous, and thus a good position to place VOIs.\nPlace multiple VOIs in the right liver lobe in different horizontal planes to achieve the most precise measure of activity, as the SUV may vary somewhat (~5%) in the right liver lobe. Calculate the mean SUV of these VOIs.\nTo quantify the SUV, for example, in the entire liver, draw ROIs covering the whole liver volume in each plane for dosimetry studies.\n\tNOTE: Avoid big structures such as arteries and veins when using this method.\nSubscription Required.
