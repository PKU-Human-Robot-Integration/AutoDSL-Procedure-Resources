    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (EDC) of Erasmus MC.\n1. Sample preparation\nCultured cells\n\t\nSelect a cell line of interest (e.g., HeLa or osteosarcoma [U2OS] cells) and grow the cells in Dulbecco's Minimal Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin.\nFor quantitative proteomics experiments, culture cells in DMEM lacking arginine and lysine. The medium must be supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and alanine-glutamine. Make two types of media by adding either conventional lysine and arginine ('Light' Medium) or lysine-8 (13C6;15N2) and arginine-10 (13C6;15N4) ('Heavy' Medium), respectively.\nCulture batches of cells in Light Medium (i.e., unlabeled) and Heavy Medium (i.e., labeled, SILAC) for at least six doublings before expansion and treatment to make sure that all proteins in the Heavy Medium culture are labeled with heavy stable isotope containing amino acids.\nTreat the cells for 8 h with 10 µM of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or an equivalent volume of DMSO as a mock treatment. Wash the cells with PBS, dissociate them using 1% trypsin/EDTA, and pellet the cells.\nLyse the cell pellet from one 150 cm2 culture plate per condition tested in 2 mL of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.2) with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC). Boil the lysate at 95 °C for 5 min and sonicate for 10 min (setting \"H\" for the sonicator listed in the Table of Materials) at 4 °C. We do not recommend the use of deubiquitinase inhibitors such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), because this may introduce unwanted protein modifications that can complicate peptide identification.\nIn vivo mouse brain tissue",
    "When using in vivo tissue, lyse the tissue in an ice-cold buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.5), 12 mM sodium DOC, and 12 mM sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate17. Sonicate the lysate for 10 min (setting \"H\" for the sonicator listed in the Table of Materials) at 4 °C and boil the lysate for 5 min at 95 °C.\nQuantitate the total protein amount using a colorimetric absorbance BCA protein assay kit. The total amount of protein should be at least several milligrams for a successful diGly peptide immunoprecipitation (IP). For SILAC experiments mix the light and heavy labeled proteins in a 1:1 ratio based on the total protein amount.\nReduce all proteins using 5 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol for 30 min at 50 °C and subsequently alkylate them with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min in the dark. Perform protein digestion with Lys-C (1:200 enzyme-to-substrate ratio) for 4 h followed by overnight digestion with trypsin (1:50 enzyme-to-substrate ratio) at 30 °C or at room temperature (RT).\nAdd trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to the digested sample to a final concentration of 0.5% and centrifuge the sample at 10,000 x g for 10 min in order to precipitate and remove all detergent. Collect the supernatant containing the peptides for subsequent fractionation.\n2. Offline peptide fractionation\nUse high pH reverse-phase (RP) C18 chromatography with polymeric stationary phase material (300 Å, 50 µM; see Table of Materials) loaded into an empty column cartridge to fractionate the tryptic peptides. The stationary phase bed size must be adjusted to the amount of protein digest to be fractionated. Prepare an empty 6 mL column cartridge (see Table of Materials) filled with 0.5 g of stationary phase material for ~10 mg of protein digest. The protein digest to stationary phase ratio should be approximately 1:50 (w/w).",
    "Load the peptides onto the prepared column and wash the column with approximately 10 column volumes of 0.1% TFA, followed by approximately 10 column volumes of H2O.\nElute the peptides into three fractions with 10 column volumes of 10 mM ammonium formate solution (pH = 10) with 7%, 13.5%, and 50% acetonitrile (AcN), respectively. Lyophilize all fractions to completeness.\nUse ubiquitin remnant motif (K-ε-GG) antibodies conjugated to protein A agarose beads for the immunoenrichment of diGly peptides. Because the exact amount of antibody per batch of beads is proprietary information and not disclosed by the manufacturer, it is recommended to use the same definition for a batch of beads as the manufacturer does in order to avoid confusion. Wash one batch of these beads 2x with PBS and split the bead slurry into six equal fractions. See Figure 1 for a detailed experimental scheme.\nDissolve the three peptide fractions collected in step 2.3 in 1.4 mL of a buffer composed of 50 mM MOPS, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 50 mM NaCl (pH = 7.2), and spin down the debris.\nAdd the supernatants of the fractions to the diGly antibody beads and incubate for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator unit. Spin down the beads and transfer the supernatant to a fresh batch of antibody beads and incubate again for 2 h at 4 °C.\nStore the supernatants for subsequent global proteome (GP) analysis.",
    "Transfer the beads from every fraction into a 200 µL pipette tip equipped with a GF/F filter plug to retain the beads. Put the pipette tip with the beads into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube equipped with a centrifuge tip adapter. Wash the beads 3x with 200 µL of ice-cold IAP buffer and subsequently 3x with 200 µL of ice-cold milliQ H2O. Spin down the column at 200 x g for 2 min before every wash step, but be careful not to let the column run dry. Elute the peptides using 2 cycles of 50 µL of 0.15% TFA.\nDesalt the peptides using a C18 stage tip (essentially a 200 µL pipette tip with two C18 disks) and dry them to completeness using vacuum centrifugation.\n3. Nanoflow LC-MS/MS\nPerform LC-MS/MS experiments on a sensitive mass spectrometer coupled to a nanoflow LC system.\nUse an in-house packed 50 cm reversed-phase column with a 75 µm inner diameter packed with CSH130 resin (3.5 µm, 130 Å) and elute the peptides with a gradient of 2−28% (AcN, 0.1% FA) over 120 min at 300 nL/min. Alternatively, use commercially available LC columns with similar properties. Keep the column at 50 °C using a column oven, for example (see Table of Materials).\nPerform the mass spectrometry analysis.\n\t\nThe mass spectrometer must be operated in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. MS1 mass spectra should be collected at high resolution (e.g., 120,000), with an automated gain control (AGC) target setting of 4E5 and a maximum injection time of 50 ms in case of an Orbitrap mass spectrometer.",
    "Perform the mass spectrometry analysis in \"Highest Intensity First\" mode first. This way, the most intense ion is selected first for fragmentation, then the second highest, and so forth, using the top speed method with a total cycle time of 3 s. Subsequently, perform a second round of DDA MS analysis in \"Lowest Intensity First\" mode, so that the least intense ion is selected first, then the second lowest, and so forth. This strategy ensures optimal detection of very low abundancy peptides.\nFilter the precursor ions according to their charge states (2-7 charges) and monoisotopic peak assignment. Exclude previously interrogated precursors dynamically for 60 s. Isolate peptide precursors with a quadrupole mass filter set to a width of 1.6 Th.\nCollect MS2 spectra in the ion trap at an AGC of 7E3 with a maximum injection time of 50 ms and HCD collision energy of 30%.\n4. Data analysis\nAnalyze the mass spectrometry raw files using an appropriate search engine such as the freely available MaxQuant software suite based on the Andromeda search engine18,19. In MaxQuant, select the default settings with a few adaptations that are indicated below. Set the enzyme specificity to trypsin, with the maximum number of missed cleavages raised to three. Set lysine with a diGly remnant (+114.04 Da), oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications, and set carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification.\nPerform database searches against a FASTA file containing protein sequences downloaded from, for example, the Uniprot repository (https://www.uniprot.org/downloads[href=https://www.uniprot.org/downloads]) combined with a decoy and a standard common contaminant database that is automatically provided by MaxQuant. Set the false discovery rate (FDR) to 1% and set the minimum score for modified (diGly) peptides to 40 (default value). Exclude peptides identified with a C-terminal diGly modified lysine residue from further analysis.",
    "For the quantitative analysis of SILAC experiment files, set the multiplicity to \"2\" and repeat step 4.2.\nPerform all downstream analyses (e.g., statistics, gene ontology analyses) with the Perseus module20 of the MaxQuant software suite.\nSubscription Required.
