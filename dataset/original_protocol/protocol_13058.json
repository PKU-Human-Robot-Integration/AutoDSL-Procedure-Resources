In this protocol, rhodamine-labeled tubulin is used but other fluorescent conjugates can be utilized as well.\nFlow Chamber assembly\n\t\nAssemble a flow chamber by placing four strips of double-sided tape (~4 cm x ~3 mm) on an advanced adhesive glass slide (parallel to the longer edge and ~3-4 mm apart) to create three 'lanes' between the tape strips.

After 5 min, wash the chamber with 80 µL of GTB.",
    "Subsequently, as in step 3.3.1, insert into the flow chamber 15 µL of 1 mg/mL Avidin (dissolved in GTB) that binds to the b-BSA. After 5 min, wash the chamber with 80 µL of GTB.\nPassivate the silanized coverslip surface using 20 µL of 1% poloxamer. After 3 min, wash with 80 µL of GTB.\nAttach biotinylated MTs (step 3.1) to the b-BSA-avidin coated coverslip by inserting 20 µL of MTs typically diluted to 1:20 in GTB. Incubate the slides in an inverted position, i.e., with the coverslip facing downwards in a dark humidity chamber (e.g., a Petri dish containing wet tissue paper) for 5 min at room temperature.

Plot the fluorescence intensity of the different Cin8-GFP motors as a function of time.",
    "NOTE: An experimental strategy to measure the cluster size-i.e., the number of Cin8 molecules in a cluster-establishes a basis for the analysis of Cin8 clustering-related motility. Photobleaching of GFP attached to Cin8 is employed to determine the contribution of single GFP molecules to the total intensity of Cin8 clusters. For example, the fluorescence intensities decrease in steps of ~50 arbitrary units (a.u.), with every single step probably representing the photobleaching of one GFP molecule (Figure 4A). Since Cin8 is a homo-tetrameric motor protein, it contains four GFP molecules. Thus, all Cin8 motors having an intensity ≤ 200 a.u. are likely to be single tetrameric Cin8 molecules. Following this method, intensity ranges of Cin8 motor fluorescence are assigned as <200, 200-400, and >400 for single Cin8 molecules, pairs of Cin8 molecules (dimer of Cin8 tetramer), and Cin8 oligomers, respectively12.\nIntensity distribution analysis for Cin8-GFP motors\n\t\nMeasure the mean florescence intensity of all the fluorescent Cin8-GFP motors in the first frame of the time-lapse sequence using TrackMate plugin in ImageJ-Fiji as described in step 4.2.2.\nPlot a histogram of the mean intensities of Cin8-GFP with a bin size of 20 a.u. and fit the major peak of the histogram to a Gaussian curve (Figure 4B).\n\t\tNOTE: Intensity distribution analysis complements the cluster size determination for Cin8-GFP motors from the photobleaching experiments. The Gaussian curve fitted to the intensity distribution histogram for the Cin8-GFP population peaks at ~125 a.u., which is consistent with the average intensity of single tetrameric Cin8 molecules containing either one, two, three, or four fluorescent (non-bleached) GFP molecules, with each fluorescent GFP molecule contributing ~50 a.u. Thus, using this intensity distribution method, the contribution of one GFP molecule can also be calculated, which can be further utilized to assign the cluster size of Cin8-GFP molecules.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63425/63425fig04v2.jpg",
    "Figure 4: Cin8-GFP bleaching profile and intensity distribution. (A) Photobleaching of GFP in four different Cin8-GFP motors. Single photobleaching steps, each likely representing the photobleaching of one GFP, lead to a drop in fluorescence intensity of ~50 a.u. (B) The intensity distribution of Cin8-GFP motors in the first frame of a time-lapse sequence (inset). The Gaussian peak (blue) centered at ~125 a.u represents single Cin8-GFP molecules. This peak exhibits the average intensity of single Cin8 tetramers with one, two, three, or four fluorescent GFP molecules, with each GFP molecule contributing ~50 a.u. to the total intensity (i.e., (50 + 100 + 150 + 200) / 4 = 125).

Record the particle coordinates in each frame (time point) of the time lapse sequence using the Point Tool and Measure options. Perform similar recording of coordinates for other fluorescent particles in the time-lapse sequence.\nAssign cluster size to all the examined Cin8-GFP particles in the first frame of their appearance, as described in step 4.2.\nMean displacement (MD) and mean square displacement (MSD) analyses\n\t\nFrom the coordinates of Cin8-GFP movements determined in step 4.4, calculate the displacements of Cin8-GFP at each time point with respect to the initial coordinates, using the equation for calculation of distance between two points with given coordinates:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63425/63425eq01.jpg\n\t\twhere, dt is the displacements of Cin8-GFP at the time t, xt and yt are the respective coordinates at time t. x0 and y0 are the respective coordinates of Cin8-GFP at t = 0.",
    "Calculate from these displacement values the displacement for all possible time intervals for a specific Cin8-GFP particle. Repeat the procedure for all the examined Cin8-GFP particles.\nPlot the mean displacement (MD) of all the examined Cin8-GFP particles versus time interval and subject to a linear fit, MD = v x t + c. The slope of this fit (v) represents the mean velocity of motile Cin8-GFP particles.\n\t\tNOTE: In this manner, the average velocity of all Cin8-GFP molecules belonging to each cluster size can be calculated separately characterizing the motility of different cluster sizes. In addition to the MD analysis, mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis can also be performed by squaring the displacement values calculated in steps 4.5.1 and 4.5.2. MSD values are plotted versus time interval and fitted to the polynomial curve MSD = v2 x t2 + 2D x t + c, giving the additional parameter D, which is the diffusion coefficient of Cin8-GFP movement. MD analysis should be performed on polarity marked MTs8,10, whereas for the MSD analysis knowledge of the MT polarity is not necessary.\nSubscription Required.
