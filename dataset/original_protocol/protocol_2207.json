    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExpression and purification of MUS81-EME1&2 complexes\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nIn this section, we describe the construction of bacterial expression plasmids, co-expression of MUS81 and EME1 or EME2 in bacterial cells, purification of MUS81-EME1&2 complexes through GST affinity column, ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography.\nLigation-independent cloning.\nDesign chimeric primers with 5ˊ and 3ˊ halves complemented to vector and insert DNAs, respectively (see the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for complete sequences).\nAmplify the inserts with chimeric primers to generate DNA fragments containing 12–18 bp overlapping to the first cloning site of pGex-DUAL vector; Amplify the vector to produce a linear duplex that contains a region overlapping to the inserts.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1816_11.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1816_12.csv\nPurify the PCR products using the Omega Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nSet up a 10-μL reaction system containing 80 ng of purified vector and 80 ng of DNA inserts in reaction buffer. Add 20 U exonuclease III and incubate on ice for 1 h.\nCritical: Exonuclease III normally digests one strand of the duplex from 3ˊ to 5ˊ at a rate of ∼12 nt / h at 4°C. DO NOT incubate the mixture at high temperatures.\nAdd 1 μL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and incubate at 65°C for 15–20 min to inactivate exonuclease III.\nTransform the mixture into E. coli DH5α competent cells.\nClone validation by DNA sequencing.\nRepeat STEPs ‘a’ to ‘g’ to construct another gene into the second cloning site.\nProtein expression and purification.\nTransform the recombinant plasmids into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) competent cells, pick up a single colony and culture in LB media supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics at 37°C overnight.",
    "Transfer the overnight culture into 1 L of LB media with 1:100 (v/v) dilution, incubate in shaker at 37°C until OD600 reaches 0.6–0.8, set temperature to 18°C and further incubate for 30 min to make sure that the temperature of culture is stabilized at 18°C.\nAdd 0.5 mM IPTG to induce protein expression for 16–20 h.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 20 min, discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cells with 15 mL of lysis buffer (store at 4°C, add DTT before use) per liter culture.\nDisrupt the cells by French Pressure at 700–800 Pa until the lysates become nearly transparent, centrifuge the lysates at 18,000 rpm for 40 min, and collect the supernatant.\nNote: One can also lyse the cells by sonication, but it is generally accepted that French Pressure is milder than sonication for cells disruption.\nMix the supernatant with 1 mL of glutathione beads and incubate the mixture by end-over-end rotation at 4°C for 1–2 h to capture the GST fusion proteins.\nWash the GST beads with 10–20 column volumes (CVs) of lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl.\nElute the GST fusion proteins using elution buffer containing 15 mM reduced glutathione (freshly prepared), collect the eluate, 5 mL per fraction for 10–20 CVs. Check each eluted fraction by 12% SDS-PAGE (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nAdd PreScission protease to the recombinant protein solution at 1:50–100 mass ratio, and incubate at 4°C overnight to remove the GST tag.\nDialyze the protein solution against SA buffer (store at 4°C, add DTT before use), and purify the protein with Resource S cation exchange column, check the eluted fractions by 12% SDS-PAGE (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nFurther purify the protein with a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size-exclusion column, check the eluted fractions by 12% SDS-PAGE (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D).",
    "Concentrate the purified proteins by using the Amicon-Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (MWCO 30 kD), 3,600 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nRepeat STEP-I until the protein concentration reaches to a desired level, aliquot and store the protein sample at −80°C for future use.\nCritical: (1) Elevated salt concentration in STEP ‘g’ is beneficial to reduce nucleic acid contamination and increase protein purity; (2) MUS81-EME2 tends to precipitate in low salt buffer (<100 mM NaCl), in that case, addition of 10%–25% glycerol would improve stability.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1816-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Purification of MUS81131-551-EME251-379 complex\n(A) SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins pulled down by GST-affinity column.\n(B) Cation-exchange chromatography and Coomassie blue-stained gel of eluted fractions.\n(C and D) Size-exclusion chromatography and Coomassie blue-stained gel of eluted fractions.\nDNA cleavage assay\nTiming: 3–5 h\nThis section describes the determination of the endonuclease activities of MUS81-EME1&2 complexes towards various DNA substrates, including 3ˊ-flap, 5ˊ-flap, nDS and nHJ.\nSet up a 20-μL cleavage reaction system as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1816_13.csv\nMix and incubate at 37°C for 60 min.\nAdd 2 μL of stop buffer (store at 4°C) and further incubate at 65°C for 15 min to quench the reactions.\nPrepare a 12% native polyacrylamide gel, perform electrophoresis at 110 V in TBE.\nNote: Adjust gel concentration according to the size of the DNA.\nImage DNA bands in the polyacrylamide gel by ChemiDoc™ Touch imaging system (Bio-Rad).\nCritical: The first cleavage products of 3′flap and nHJ, termed as nDS, can be further processed into smaller duplexes. In those cases, it is critical to use limited amounts of enzyme (<60 nM) so that the first cleavage can be appreciated."
