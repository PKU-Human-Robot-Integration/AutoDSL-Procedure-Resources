    "General cell cultureCell maintenance and passageCells were routinely maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere provided by autoclaved ddH2O, supplemented with 1% AQUAGUARD-1 (see Recipes). All class II cabinet surfaces as well as CO2 incubators were routinely disinfected with either Mikrozid (weekly) or 70% ethanol (daily) solution.Cultured cells were routinely observed by phase contrast microscopy. All cell lines were maintained in T75 flasks with 12-14 ml medium or T25 flasks in 4-5 ml medium. All cell lines were sub-cultured every 2-3 days or when ~80-95% confluent. Epithelial cells were routinely passaged at 1:10 ratios and effector (3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L) cells at 1:6 ratios.For routine passaging, cells were collected by washing with a solution of 0.1% (w/v) EDTA in phosphate buffered saline (EDTA/PBS) (see Recipes) for 5 min and then addition of Trypsin-EDTA solution, until cells detached from the culture flasks. Trypsin was inactivated by the addition of the respective serum-supplemented culture medium when cells were re-suspended, followed by centrifugation to aspirate medium and resuspension in fresh culture medium.Cultured cells were medium-changed every two days, unless otherwise stated. 3T3 cells were harvested and passaged as with carcinoma cells with the exemption of a very short EDTA/PBS treatment, as extended periods risked rapid cell detachment.Cryopreservation and recoveryFor long-term storage, following growth and appropriate passage, cell ‘banks’ and ‘sub-banks’ were cryo-preserved in liquid nitrogen as described below.For cryopreservation of cell lines, cultures were collected by routine passaging and precipitated by centrifugation. The cell pellet was re-suspended in Freezing medium (see Recipes) at a cell density not less than 1 x 106 cells/ml.Cells were aliquoted in a total of 1-1.5 ml to polypropylene cryovials and then transferred to an ice-cold ‘Mr Frosty freezing container’ containing 250 ml of isopropanol to control the cooling rate to 1 °C per minute.",
    "Cells were then placed within a -80 °C freezer for 4-6 h prior to transfer to liquid nitrogen.Cells were recovered by thawing rapidly at 37 °C, before 5-10 ml of pre-warmed growth medium was added. Cells were centrifuged at 210 x g for 5 min and then seeded to tissue culture flasks as required (T25 flasks for routine maintenance and T75 flasks for preparation of co-cultures).Notes: We recommend that experiments be carried out for cultures maintained for a maximum of 10-15 passages. To avoid any artefacts due to possible culture-associated genetic drift, new cell cultures should be established following that number of passages. The usage of cell ‘banks’ and ‘sub-banks’ allows all experimentation to be performed with consistent results.For cell lines maintained in culture medium supplemented with FBS, the serum batch used was previously tested (‘batch-testing’) to ensure it was optimal for cell growth. Cell growth/proliferation was tested using the CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Assay. OtherAll cell lines were routinely tested to confirm absence of Mycoplasma contamination using the MycoProbeTM Mycoplasma detection assay (see Reagents).Co-culture of effector (3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L) and target (epithelial) cells (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180628/20180628235001_6349.jpgFigure 1. Step-by-step guide for the preparation of co-cultures for the delivery of mCD40L to target epithelial cells. Effector (3T3) cells are prepared for co-cultures (‘Day 0’ and ‘Day 1’) as detailed (A) and seeded in appropriate multi-well formats (dependent on the readout/assay). Thereafter, target epithelial cells are prepared (‘Day 2’) and seeded on top of the effector cells (B) to set up the co-cultures. Following completion of the procedure, the co-cultures are incubated for the time period required in order to detect biochemical markers of apoptosis or intracellular signaling mediators of cell death (as indicated in A).",
    "Preparation of effector and target cells (‘Day 0’)The day before establishing the co-cultures, the effector cells (3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L) should be in exponential growth phase and no more than 85% confluent.Passage 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L effector cells and seed in T75 flasks at a density of 21 x 105 cells per flask and incubate overnight (O/N).In parallel ensure that target cells (epithelial cells, e.g., HCT116 and EJ) are passaged appropriately in order to ensure they are in exponential growth phase (the ‘splitting’ ratio depends on the growth characteristics of the cell line).The following day, i.e., the day when co-culture experiments are initiated (‘Day 1’ – see below), replenish the culture medium for all cultures (i.e., medium-change 3T3s and target epithelial cells).Note: Ensure this takes place first thing am (particularly for 3T3 cells, before the next step is performed). Growth-arresting of effector 3T3 cells by Mitomycin C (MMC) treatment (‘Day 1’)Approximately 5-6 h (i.e., mid-afternoon) after the effector 3T3 cells have been medium-changed, remove the medium from 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L flasks and add 9 ml per T75 flask of DR only medium (without supplements) containing 5 µg/ml of Mitomycin C (MMC), and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C. Figure 2A shows representative cultures of 3T3 cells before and after MMC treatment.Aspirate the medium and wash the cells with PBS 3-times to remove any traces of MMC. Add 0.8 ml of trypsin-EDTA to each flask and incubate for 1-2 min until cells have detached, then inactivate with complete culture medium. Centrifuge at 210 x g for 5 min, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in complete culture medium.Count cells (3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L) and calculate the required volume of cell suspension.",
    "Add 100 µl containing 1 x 104 cells per well in 96 well plates (for cytotoxicity assays), 6 x 104 cells per well in 24 well plates (for supernatant collection), 3 x 105 cells per well in 6 well plates, or 30 x 105 cells per well in 10 cm diameter dishes (for cultures to be used for flow cytometry experiments and preparation of whole cell lysates).Note: The number of cells and minimal volume per well for different types of multi-well plates is based on a conversion according to the differences in culture surface area.Once the effector 3T3 cells have been seeded, incubate plates O/N at 37 °C (Figure 1A).Note: For DNA fragmentation assays, the epithelial cells can be pre-pulsed with DNA labelling agent O/N (see below). Seeding of target (epithelial cells) onto 3T3 effector cells (co-culture) (‘Day 2’)The following day (first thing in the morning), the target cells are washed with EDTA/PBS (following medium removal), then 0.8 ml of trypsin-EDTA are added per flask and cells are incubated at 37 °C for 2-3 min until cells have detached. The trypsin is inactivated with addition of complete culture medium.Note: If necessary, target cells can be pre-treated with any pharmacological inhibitors (for functional experiments) as required, before trypsinisation and counting.Centrifuge at 210 x g for 5 min and then aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in complete culture medium. Then, count the cells and calculate the required volume of cell suspension.Remove the culture medium from each well or culture dishes containing the effector cells (3T3s) from the previous day (Step B2c above) using a small yellow tip and gentle aspiration (it helps to ensure the multi-well plate is tilted and the tip touches just the edge at the bottom of the well to avoid removal of adhered cells).",
    "Add 100 µl of suspension containing 1 x 104 cells per well of epithelial cells on top of the 3T3 effectors (or the equivalent volume and number of cells based on the conversion described in Step B2 above).Note: By seeding the above-stated number of epithelial cells, a 1:1 (effector:target) ratio is utilised (e.g., HCT116 cells); however in some cases a 1:0.8 ratio might be optimal (e.g., EJ cells).The co-cultures are now established and multi-well plates (or dishes) are incubated at 37 °C (Figure 1B).Incubation period varies depending on the assay or procedure to be performed (e.g., cell death assays, collection of supernatants or to lyse the cells). Figure 2B provides an example of representative co-cultures at 72 h.Notes: The same steps are followed for the co-culture of normal epithelial cells with 3T3 effectors, however for such co-cultures normal (NHU) cells are seeded in their own (serum-free, KSFM medium).For functional inhibition experiments, co-cultures can take place in the continued presence of any pharmacological inhibitor, as required.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180629/20180629000652_6654.jpgFigure 2. Images of effector (3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L) cells alone or in co-culture with epithelial (HCT116) cells. A. Representative phase contrast images of 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L effector cells before and after MMC treatment, which is carried out in order to mediate 3T3 cell growth arrest. The images confirm how 3T3 cells remain viable and healthy following treatment. B. Phase contrast microscopy images of representative co-cultures of growth-arrested 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L effector cells with the carcinoma cell line HCT116 for 72 h. Co-culture of HCT116 cells with 3T3CD40L fibroblasts represents delivery of ‘mCD40L’, whilst co-culture with 3T3Neo serves as ‘Control’. Note how cytotoxicity is evident by the presence of dark, phase-non-bright apoptotic cells (representative dead cells, or aggregates of such cells, are indicated by solid triangles). Scale bars = 100 μm.",
    "Activation of CD40 ligation by soluble agonistIn order to compare the effects of mCD40L to those of soluble agonists, epithelial cells seeded at the same densities described above, are treated routinely with the well-characterized agonistic anti-CD40 mAb G28-5 (Bugajska et al., 2002).Add G28-5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) during seeding of the epithelial cells at a concentration of 10 µg/ml (mAb was purified from culture supernatants of the HB-9110 hybridoma line).To increase the cross-linking capacity of the mAb, crosslink the antibody with the affinity-purified human serum protein-adsorbed goat anti-mouse IgG (X-linker) used at 2.5 µg/ml. Add the X-linker to the cultures 30 min following addition of the G28-5 mAb.Note: The differences in the pro-apoptotic capabilities of soluble agonists versus mCD40L have been presented and detailed elsewhere (Dunnill et al., 2017). Detection of biochemical markers of cell death (apoptosis)Loss of cell membrane integrity (permeabilisation)Seed carcinoma cells on top of growth-arrested 3T3s in 96 well white, tissue culture-treated plates (as detailed above) and incubate at 37 °C for 48 h (or 72 h).Add 50 µl of CytoTox-GloTM substrate (see Reagents) and incubate for 10 min at room temperature in the dark (therefore the final volume is 150 µl/well).Use a FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech) plate reader to measure luminescence (RLU).Acquire data using MARS software (BMG Labtech) and analyse by Microsoft Excel appropriately to correct for background associated with 3T3 fibroblasts (as detailed in the Data analysis section); representative data are provided in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180629/20180629001542_3753.jpgFigure 3. Detection of loss of plasma membrane integrity as a marker of cell death. 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L fibroblasts were co-cultured with HCT116 and EJ tumour cells as detailed in the main text for 48 h. Loss of membrane integrity was detected using the Cytotox-Glo reagent.",
    "Raw data (relative luminescence units, RLU) for all cultures (co- and mono-cultures) are shown in panel A. Data for co-cultures only, obtained following pairwise subtraction of 3T3Neo (Control) and 3T3CD40L (mCD40L) culture RLU readings from the RLU readings obtained for the respective co-cultures (‘bkgd corr’), are presented in panel B (see also Data analysis). Finally, data are expressed as fold change (i.e., ‘mCD40L RLU’/‘Control RLU’ for each co-culture) in panel C.Effector caspase activationSeed carcinoma cells on top of growth-arrested 3T3s in 96 well white, tissue culture-treated plates (as detailed above) and incubate at 37 °C for 48 h or 72 h (the latter time-point often provides more intense caspase activity).Top up all wells with 50 µl of medium, then add 50 µl of SensoLyte® Homogenous AFC Caspase-3/7 substrate (see Reagents), so the total volume is 200 µl/well.Incubate the plates at room temperature (RT) overnight in the dark, then measure fluorescence (RFU) using a FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech) plate reader, using Excitation/Emission 355 nm/520 nm filters, respectively.Acquire data using MARS software (BMG Labtech) and analyse using Microsoft Excel appropriately in order to correct for background related to 3T3 fibroblasts (as detailed in the Data analysis section); representative data are provided in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180629/20180629001822_6898.jpgFigure 4. Detection of effector caspase activation. 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L fibroblasts were co-cultured with HCT116 and EJ tumour cells as in Figure 3 for 72 h. Effector caspase 3/7 activity was detected using the Sensolyte caspase 3/7 reagent. Relative fluorescence unit (RFU) data for co-cultures were obtained following pairwise subtraction of 3T3Neo (Control) and 3T3CD40L (mCD40L) mono-culture RFU readings from the RFU readings obtained for the respective co-cultures (‘bkgd corr’) and shown in panel A. Data are also expressed as fold caspase activity (i.e., ‘mCD40L RFU’/‘Control RFU’ for each co-culture) in panel B.",
    "DNA fragmentationFor this assay, and as shown in Figure 1B, on the day when 3T3 fibroblasts are treated with MMC and seeded, the epithelial cells can be treated (‘pulsed’) with DNA labelling agent BrdU at a concentration of 10 µM (according to the manufacturer’s instructions, see Reagents) overnight (O/N).The next day, epithelial cells are washed once with EDTA/PBS, lifted by trypsinisation, counted and then added as a 200 µl suspension on top of the growth-arrested 3T3 cells (following medium removal from the wells and as described in the co-culture protocol above). Cell cultures are then incubated for 48 h (or 72 h).As positive control and for the purposes of calculating % DNA fragmentation (below), treat carcinoma cells alone with 0.5 µM of Staurosporine (STS) (or, alternatively, 3 µg/ml Doxorubicin) for 48 h.The day before DNA fragmentation is measured, prepare (‘coat’) ELISA plates for the detection of fragmented DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions.On the day of the experiment, collect supernatants from co-cultures and add 100 µl of culture supernatant to the appropriate wells in the coated 96 well ELISA plates; perform ELISA as described by the manufacturer and when complete, incubate the 96 well ELISA plate(s) O/N at 4 °C.On the following day, complete the ELISA assay (as described in the manufacturer’s instructions) and using a FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech) plate reader measure absorbance (Abs) at 455 nm.Acquire data using MARS software (BMG Labtech) and analyse by Microsoft Excel.Calculate % DNA fragmentation as follows: % apoptotic cells = (Abs of co-cultured cells) x 100/(Abs of target cells treated with STS); representative data are provided in Figure 5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180629/20180629002044_7037.jpgFigure 5. Detection of DNA fragmentation.",
    "3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L fibroblasts were co-cultured with DNA labelling agent (BrdU)-pulsed HCT116 cells for 48 h and DNA fragmentation was detected using an ELISA assay as detailed in the main text. Raw absorbance readings (at 455 nm wavelength) are presented in panel A for both co-cultures, whilst treatment of HCT116 cells with staurosporine (STS) at 0.5 μM served as a positive control for maximal DNA fragmentation. Values obtained for co-cultures were expressed as % DNA fragmentation (% DNA frag) relative to STS (panel B), calculated as detailed in the appropriate section in the main text.Detection of intracellular mediators of cell deathReactive oxygen speciesMeasurement of fluorescence by spectrophotometry Epithelial cells are co-cultured with 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L cells as described above (in 96 well plates). Notably, however, when such co-cultures are performed, 3T3s are not growth-arrested with MMC to avoid high background fluorescence readings due to interaction with CM-H2DCFDA.Note: The duration of the experiments is short and therefore any growth of 3T3 cells does not affect overall cell viability in such short-term co-cultures.Incubate co-cultures for the required period of time (from 30 min to 3 h).Wash cells with PBS to remove any culture medium then add 100 µl/well of pre-warmed (at 37 °C) PBS containing 1 µM of CM-H2DCFDA and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After treatment, remove the CM-H2DCFDA reagent and add 100 µl of pre-warmed (at 37 °C) PBS.Measure fluorescence on a FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech) plate reader at Excitation 485 nm/Emission 520 nm.Acquire data using MARS software (BMG Labtech) and analyse using Microsoft Excel appropriately in order to correct for background related to 3T3 fibroblasts (as detailed in the Data analysis section); representative data are provided in Figure 6A.Measurement of fluorescence by flow cytometry Treat (label) the required number of epithelial cells (e.g.",
    ", EJ) with pre-warmed PBS containing 1 µM of H2DCFDA and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Epithelial cells can be labelled whilst adherent or in suspension.Co-culture CM-H2DCFDA labelled epithelial cells with 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L effectors as described above in 6 well plates for 3 h.Following co-culture, add 200 µl of trypsin to lift cells, and when the cells have detached, inactivate by adding 500 µl of PBS containing 5% FBS.Collect cells in 1.5 ml sample tubes and centrifuge for 10 min at 210 x g at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant, resuspend in cold PBS (or FACS buffer) and measure fluorescence by flow cytometry using a Guava EasyCyte instrument. Analyse data post-acquisition using Guava EasyCyte software; Figure 6B provides an example of such analysis and illustrates the ‘gating’ strategy followed to measure ROS induction in epithelial cells only (and to exclude any 3T3 cell associated auto-fluorescence).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180629/20180629002959_5565.jpgFigure 6. Detection of ROS by spectrophotometry (A) and flow cytometry (B) analysis. A. 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L fibroblasts were seeded in 96 well plates before being co-cultured with EJ cells for 30 min. Cell cultured were labelled with CM-H2DCFDA as described in the main text. RFU data were obtained following pairwise background subtraction from 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L alone mono-cultures. Unlabelled co-cultures (No label) served as negative controls (left). Data are also presented as fold change in RFU readings relative to controls (right). B. 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L fibroblasts were seeded in 24 well plates before being co-cultured with EJ cells for 3 h (EJ were labelled with CM-H2DCFDA before co-culture). Green fluorescence intensity histograms provided a pattern of fluorescence indicative of two populations (‘peaks’), 3T3 and epithelial cells, which were unlabelled and labelled with CM-H2DCFDA, respectively.",
    "Appropriate ‘gating’ on the epithelial cell population (right peak) was performed as indicated (gate R1) for 3T3Neo/EJ (upper histogram) and 3T3CD40L/EJ co-cultures (lower histogram). Data from both were overlaid (right panel) following gating, in order to identify changes in fluorescence intensity in EJ cells only. The shift in intensity (grey versus empty) indicates ROS induction mediated by mCD40L.Note: For both spectrophotometric and flow cytometric detection of ROS, 3T3 cells were not growth-arrested with MMC to ensure lack of significant background fluorescence following labelling with CM-H2DCFDA.Adaptor proteins and pro-apoptotic kinases (immunoblotting)Seed 3T3Neo and 3T3CD40L cells following treatment with MMC (above) in 10 cm diameter dishes at 30 x 105 cells/dish in 10 ml of DR 5%, or in 6 well plates at 3 x 105/well in 2 ml of medium (prepare duplicate dishes or wells for every condition). Incubate dishes/plates at 37 °C O/N.Following O/N attachment, remove supernatants and add 10 ml of target cell suspension in DR/5% medium containing 30 x 105 cells/dish or 2 ml containing 3 x 105 cells/well in 6 well plates.Incubate the dishes/plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for the required time period (can vary from 1.5 h to 36 h).Upon completion of the incubation period, prepare lysates by adding 150 µl of complete lysis buffer/dish or 70 µl/well for 6-well plates (see Recipes for lysis buffer preparation) and quantify protein concentration in all lysates as described (Dunnill et al., 2017).Perform SDS-Polyacrylamide gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting for 40 µg of protein lysate for the detection of intracellular proteins expression in target cells; representative data are shown in Figure 7B.",
    "Note: Although expression of β-actin can be used to demonstrate overall equal loading, because lysates are prepared from 3T3neo/3T3CD40L and epithelial cell co-cultures (and thus are a mixture of cell types – epithelial and non-epithelial cells), it is essential to ensure that sample loading is confirmed (and adjusted if necessary) for epithelial cells; this can be carried out according to reactivity with human-specific anti-cytokeratin antibodies e.g., anti-CK8 or anti-CK18 – see Figure 7A for an example and elsewhere (Dunnill et al., 2017). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180629/20180629003410_9410.jpgFigure 7. Detection of intracellular signalling proteins activated by mCD40L using immunoblotting. HCT116 cells were co-cultured with 3T3Neo (‘–’) and 3T3CD40L (‘mCD40L’) fibroblasts for the indicated time periods and whole cell protein lysates prepared as described in the main text. Forty microgram of total protein were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. β-actin expression demonstrated overall equal loading, whilst correct loading for epithelial cell lysate was confirmed according to reactivity with human-specific anti-CK18 antibody (see main text) (panel A). Representative experiments for detection of TRAF3 and phospho-ASK1 are shown in panel B. Note how the inclusion of lysate from 3T3CD40L culture alone confirmed the specificity of the antibodies for human (epithelial) cell protein detection."
