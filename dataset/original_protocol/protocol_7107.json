    "Cell plate preparationIt is important that agar plates are made correctly and consistently, to achieve a standardized and even transfer of cells upon robotic pinning. When casting the agar plates, it is important to always use the same volume (precisely 50 mL/plate) of well-mixed media per plate, and let the plates solidify on a completely level surface. If the solidification surface is not level, this will produce plates with a non-level agar surface, where the pinning robot applies the cells unevenly across the plate during pinning. If the plates are made with agar medium volumes different than 50 mL, uneven hydration and variability due to altered agar surface shapes and properties between plates may result. All agar plates should be inspected before screening, to ensure plate quality and hydration levels are consistent among the set of plates. Because some plate imperfections are only detected at the pinning stage, make sure to cast a few extra plates than are strictly needed. A related source of variability is the specific firmness of the agar medium, which can affect the pinning and transfer of cells. The optimal pinning pressure to use with the Rotor HDA robot will vary depending on the firmness of the specific agar plates used (and is usually related to the agar concentration).The procedure of cell transfer onto agar plates is a crucial step in assessing the ability of yeast cells to grow in visible light (Molin et al., 2020). If too many cells are transferred to the same spot, the cells on top will shield and protect the cells below from the light (which makes them grow), resulting in the scoring of growth as light-resistant, i.e., at higher initial cell density all cells/mutants will appear light-resistant (Figure 1A).",
    "Figure 1B shows how the wild-type (wt) control and the positive control strain (lacking the antioxidant transcription factor Yap1, and therefore being light-sensitive) that were used to set up the screening conditions respond differently to illumination, depending on the cell density spotted. Agar to agar pinning that results in larger chunks of cells being transferred to the same spot, results in all cells growing, including the positive control (Molin et al., 2020). Thus, for high-throughput and medium throughput screens for which pinning machines are used, liquid-to-agar transfer should be the mode of cell-transfer used to better be able to control the initial cell density on the experimental plates. Care should be taken to ensure that an even number of cells per strain is being transferred.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4292/bioprotoc-12-02-4292-g001.jpgFigure 1. Because of a strong dependence on the initial cell density, and the impact of illumination on temperature, high-throughput screening of yeast mutant libraries for light-sensitivity necessitates several special adaptations. A. Schematic representation of the growth of light-sensitive mutants compared to the control strain, taking into account the intital cell density. The screen is delicate to perform, since the analytical window where light-sensitivity can be scored is rather narrow. B. Both the light intensity and the initial cell density affect the light sensitivity of yeast strains, as observed here on both the wild-type and the yap1∆ mutant strains. C. Images show the contrast in growth between the wild-type and the positive control yap1∆, using the same experimental procedure and format (384 colonies/plate) as used in the genome-wide screening experiments. D. The spectrum of the UV-filtered fluorescent lamp (Osram L 940) in comparison to the spectrum of a normal fluorescent lamp in the lab (Philips Master 830). The inset shows an enlargement of the 350-450 nm range.",
    "Note that the peak in the UV range at ~360 nm in the normal lamp is absent for the UV filtered Osram L 940. E-F. Overview (E) and picture (F) of the experimental setup used.Using such a setup, it is possible to generate growth conditions amenable to high-throughput screening, during which the positive control strain yap1∆ does not grow upon illumination, while the control strain grows fine (Figure 1C). Due to the difficulty in achieving an optimal cell density for all strains in a high-throughput screen, it is recommended that each strain is serially pinned onto a number of positions, thus obtaining a range of cell-densities. In our study, serial pinning was done in our first validation test (Molin et al., 2020). However, this procedure could be applied to the primary genome-wide screen as well, but at the cost of handling a much larger number of plates in representing the whole yeast mutant collection. For verification studies with a selected number of mutants, serial drop tests should be used to even better control for comparable initial cell densities during light exposure.Screening collection preparation step 1 – liquid-to-agar pinning of mutant collectionThe yeast deletion collection is stored long-term at -80°C and the 96 well plates need to be thawed at room temperature (RT) before pinning.Pin from thawed stock source plates, using 96-format long-pin pads onto solid YPD agar experimental plates, in a 384-array format using the pinning robot. The YPD medium in this step ensures good survival and recovery of the frozen cells.For the source plates, apply 2D target mixing for 10 repetitions at a distance of 0.1  mm from the bottom of the wells, with a mixing speed of 25  mm/s and a mixing diameter of 1  mm.",
    "For pinning onto the agar, the pinning pressure is 7%, with an agar overshoot of 2  mm and a pinning speed of 19  mm/s.Note: The deletion collection contains multiple mutants which are sensitive to being picked up directly onto liquid media. Thus, it is strongly recommended that the collection is taken up onto solid YPD agar first. This also allows condensation of the collection down to a 384 array format, which will use ¼ as many plates. In addition, any missing colonies can often be picked up and inoculated-in manually at a later stage. Screening collection preparation step 2 – agar-to-liquid pinning of mutant collectionPin from a 384-array format collection YPD agar stock plates, using 96-format long-pin pads, into flat bottom 96 well plates (manually pre-loaded with 300 µl of YPD per well) using the pinning robot.Notes:  For efficient stirring, round bottom plates should not be used, since in them cells will collect in the bottom-center of the wells, irrespective of the stirring. Although not tested here, it should be pointed out that it may be possible to transfer liquid mutant cultures to pinning plates using a liquid handling robot. As a rough estimate of the amounts of liquid culture suitable, we measured the amount of liquid transferred by each pin on the Singer RePads to involve volumes in the sub-μL range (~0.1 μL). For pinning from the agar source plate, the pinning pressure is 7%, with an agar overshoot of 2  mm, a pinning speed of 19 mm/s, and mixing on the source plate using default values. For the target liquid-medium plates, 2D source mixing for 10 repetitions at a distance of 0.1 mm from the bottom of the wells, with a mixing speed of 25 mm/s, and a mixing diameter of 1  mm is applied.",
    "Note: Applying mixing on the agar source plates allows for more consistent pinning of small colonies, as the pins of the pinning pad effectively cover larger areas. Primary genome-wide screen – liquid-to-agar pinning onto platesPreculture cells in 96 well microtitre plates for 48 h at 30°C in 300 μL of liquid YPD medium without agitation.Note: Although we grew liquid precultures in rich undefined YPD medium (Molin et al., 2020), we see no reason for why it should not be possible to preculture cells in synthetic complete liquid medium instead (similar to the medium we used in the experimental plates but lacking agar). In relation to this, we don't think the YPD medium would be appropriate for the experimental plates because of their coloration, which would influence the exposure to light (in particular the reflected light that travels through the agar). Before pinning, shake plates at 500 rpm (using the Vibrax VXR basic shaker) for 10  min to ensure proper mixing and optimized/consistent cell transfer. Yeast cells are dense and easily sediment when plates are standing still for too long, which is why we shake plates in batches of 4-5 plates before pinning (the pinning takes about 3-5 min per plate, including manual mounting of plates and refilling of pinning pads). The whole collection of mutants is represented on 61 plates in the 96-well format (including five where slow growing mutants have been gathered) or 16 plates in the 384 format (including two with slow growers). Thus, for the whole mutant collection, the pinning procedure will take a couple of hours.",
    "Pin from liquid preculture source plates (four different 96 well plates per agar experimental plate) using 96-format long-pin pads onto solid agar experimental plates in a 384-array (Figure 2), using the pinning robot and the 1:4 array setup (see the Singer Rotor HDA User manual, v1.2, p. 24, available at SINGER INSTRUMENTS ROTOR HDA USER MANUAL Pdf Download | ManualsLib[href=https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1630138/Singer-Instruments-Rotor-Hda.html]). Agar target plates for assessing cell growth during light exposure contained synthetic complete medium with 2% agar.We used the default version of the pinning program. For good pick-up of cells from the liquid culture source plate, it is optimal to use 2D source mixing for 10 repetitions at a distance of 0.1 mm from the bottom of the wells, with a mixing speed of 25 mm/s, and a mixing diameter of 1 mm. For pinning onto the agar target plates, the pinning pressure is 7%, with an agar overshoot of 2 mm, and a pinning speed of 19 mm/s. Each colony is pinned once, since repeated pinning on the same spot will result in a higher number of cells inoculated, which can be detrimental for assessing light-sensitivity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4292/bioprotoc-12-02-4292-g002.jpgFigure 2. An example plate in the primary screen for yeast light-sensitivity imaged at different time points of light-exposure along with the corresponding dark control. To identify light sensitive mutants, an automated image analysis algorithm was used to analyze photos of plates exposed to light taken at day 0 and 6, and control plates incubated in the dark at day 0 and 1. Green and orange rings indicate mutant colonies scored as light-sensitive, with a high and moderate confidence, respectively. The red ring denotes a mutant colony growing neither on plates incubated in the dark nor light, illustrating the need to take into account growth under both conditions in scoring light sensitivity.",
    "The white rectangles at the border of the plates enclose the wild type controls. High-resolution images of plates that may be used for testing out the scoring algorithm are available in Figures S1-S4[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20220111/Supplementary%20Figures%20S1%20S4.docx].Note: We pinned strains at only one position on the experimental plates, to minimize the number of plates to be handled in the light-exposure set-up. However, a number of technical replicates per plate may be alternatively included, to obtain a better precision in the measurements, at the cost of having to set up a more extensive light-exposure stand. Our strategy was to apply a two-tiered subsequent validation of the positive hits in the initial screen instead (Molin et al., 2020). It is important to incorporate a high number of wild-type or wild-type-like controls in the mutant collection used, which will later serve as controls for setting the scoring thresholds, and to experimentally estimate the number of false-positives, as explained in the data analysis part of this protocol. This is not provided in the deletion collections listed in Materials and Reagents. We used 76 (in our case his3∆ mutant strain) controls per plate, as realized in the Boone lab setup of the haploid Mat a deletion collection (Tong et al., 2001), adding up to 1,064 controls in total for the whole experiment.First validation test, medium-throughput assay – liquid-to-agar pinning onto plates using repeated pinning with variable cell densities.To achieve an improved precision in the final scoring, selected light-sensitive strains from the primary screen may be serially pinned to a number of plate positions, to obtain a concentration gradient of cell-densities (Figure 3A-3B). Using the same pinning procedure as described for the primary screen, but where only one 96 well plate is used to inoculate one 384 format, results in four colonies of each strain on the plate.",
    "However, by introducing a time-delay between each of the four pinnings (and in this case, no shaking of plates in-between), cell sedimentation will result in lower amounts of cells being transferred for each pinning round. The default program options should be used for the liquid-to-agar transfer, which means no 2D source mixing. Example images of plates from a medium-throughput follow-up screen performed this way are seen in Figure 3C.Note: The use of deletion mutants from a different collection than in the primary screen (e.g., the homozygous diploid deletion mutant collection) during the validation tests reduces the risk of cross-contamination influencing the final scoring. In addition, the homozygous diploid deletion mutant collection is expected to be buffered against recessive suppressor mutations that may have accumulated, since any such mutations would most likely be heterozygotic. Second validation test, low-throughput assay - serial dilution drop test to more precisely control for a lower number of light-sensitive strainsA second confirmation test based on quantitative serial dilutions can be performed (Figure 3D-3E). This method enables a quantitative measure of light sensitivity that ranks the mutants’ rate of growth during illumination (growth during illumination relative to their growth in the dark control). We suggest preparing five tenfold serial dilutions, with a starting dilution of OD610 ~1 (24  h of growth in liquid medium resulted in an OD ~4) and spot 7 μL of each dilution onto SC agar plates prepared as above, which are then either subjected to light-exposure or incubated in the dark.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4292/bioprotoc-12-02-4292-g003.jpgFigure 3. Medium-throughput and low-throughput verification assays suitable for scoring yeast light-sensitivity. A. In the medium-throughput assay, each strain is pinned into four different positions on the plate (like a quadrant). The pinning order is indicated for one of the strains in the upper left corner.",
    "A slight delay between the four pinnings was imposed, resulting in a gradient of cells being transferred like in a dilution series. B. Quantification of the average dilutions imposed by the repeated pinnings among all the 96 strains tested. The line in the box indicates the median and box boundaries the 25th and 75th percentiles. C. Example images of plates from medium-throughput verification assay of 96 strains at different time-points. D. Quantitative serial dilution drop test validation assay. Strains are first diluted to the same cell density (OD610 ~1), further diluted in five sequential 10-fold dilutions, and spotted onto agar plates. Plates are either exposed to light or kept in the dark and imaged daily. Images of wild type, yap1∆, and nsr1∆ strains grown on dark control and light exposed plates after 2 days. E. Growth curves of the strains shown in D, where the cell-spot intensity has been estimated for images taken over 6 days.Experimental setup for light-exposureIn order to minimize UV light induced DNA damage in cells, i.e., to ensure that exclusively growth defects caused by visible light (400-700 nm) are measured, use a light source consisting of a UV radiation-filtered fluorescent lamp, e.g., Osram L 940. We used three light tubes in parallell, 58 W each, fitted in an open standard light tube fitting, equipped with a reflector, but without a deflecting grid. Figure 1D shows the spectrum of this lamp in comparison to a commonly used non-UV filtered fluorescent lamp (Philips Master 830). Spectra from the lamps can be measured directly using a fiber-coupled spectrometer (e.g., QE65000-FL, Oceans Optics). Make sure to measure the spectra through the lid of the agar plate, since the plates will be covered with the lid during the experiment to minimize evaporation.",
    "To prevent dehydration of the agar, the plate edges between the lid and the base should be closed with parafilm. To increase the light-intensity, and to get an even distribution of the light irradiation over the plate, a white paper should be fitted to the outside bottom of each plate.Place the plates below the light source with the top (lid-side) up (Figure 1E-1F). Make sure to measure the light intensities at different distances from the edge of the reflector. In our case, light intensities dropped towards the edges and, hence, we made sure to not put any experimental plates closer than roughly 30 cm from the edge of the lamp (Figure 1F). The distance between the lamp and the plates should be optimized in such a way that a substantial contrast in growth between the wild-type and the positive control yap1∆ is obtained. The on-site intensity should be ~35  W/m2 (in our case with the three 58W lamps, the distance used was 20 cm). As the temperature in the plate is dependent on the distance from the light source and the temperature in the laboratory, the environment around the plates must be controlled to achieve the desired temperature in the plates. In our case, putting the plates on thin ribs (Figure 1E-1F), allowing good ventilation, in a room with a temperature of about 21°C resulted in a temperature of ~30°C in the plates (note that the temperature has to be measured inside the plates), compared to ~34°C if the plates were placed directly on a bench.The control plates (no illumination) should be kept in the dark at the same temperature as the plates incubated in light (30°C).Image or scan the plates regularly.",
    "For the high- and medium-throughput screens, we imaged the plates after 0, 1, 2, and 6 days, using a 12.3-megapixel digital camera (D5000, Nikon, Japan). Example images taken at different time points during a genome-wide screen are seen in Figure 2. For the low-throughput validation serial drop test, we scanned the plates after 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 days with a photo scanner (Epson Perfection V700) set in transmission mode (Figure 3D-3E).Note: To achieve a higher precision in cell number estimations, plates used in the high- and medium-throughput screen may be scanned in transmission mode and cell numbers quantified, like performed in the plate-based Scan-o-matic high-throughput phenotyping method (Zackrisson et al., 2016)."
