    "The animal experiments were approved by the Committee for Animal Experiments of the District of Southern Finland (ESAVI/6285/04.10.07/2014).\n1. Establishment of the BBTB Mimics\nNOTE: Cell culture medium and supplements are detailed in the Table of materials.\nPreparation of astrocytes\nNOTE: The following volumes are suitable for a 10 cm Petri dish or a T75 cell culture flask.\n\t\nUnder a sterile cell culture hood, carefully wash the cultured astrocytes with 5 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Gently discard the PBS using a vacuum pump and add 2 mL of the cell dissociation reagent for 5 min (at 37 °C, see the Table of Materials) to detach the cells. Check the cell detachment under the microscope. Do not exceed 5 min of incubation to limit the stress on the cells.\nAdd 10 mL of sterile complete astrocyte cell culture medium (ABM+) to the vessel to inhibit the activity of the cell dissociation reagent. Use a sterile serological pipet to transfer the detached cells from the vessel to a sterile 15 mL tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 3 min at 250 rcf (acceleration: 9 rcf/s, deceleration: 5 rcf/s) at room temperature (RT).\nMeanwhile, prepare the inserts (see the Table of Materials): using sterile forceps, place the inserts with the brain side up (Figure 1A) on the lid of a sterile 6-well plate (Figure 1B). Verify beforehand that the plate can be placed upside down on the inserts without touching or moving the inserts during the process.\nNOTE: The proper placement of the inserts allows the entrapment of the astrocyte suspension in-between the membrane and the bottom of the well.",
    "Once centrifuged, carefully discard the supernatant from the cell suspension; resuspend the astrocyte pellet in 1 mL of ABM+ by gently resuspending the pellet on the tube’s wall up to 5x. Avoid excessive pipetting of the cells to limit the stress on the cells. Count the cells and adjust the cell suspension density to 1.5 x 105 cells in 400 µL of ABM+/insert.\nPlace the cell suspension in the middle of the brain-side of the insert’s membrane (Figure 1B) and, very carefully, spread it by using capillary force with a sterile pipet tip. Avoid direct contact as the membrane is particularly fragile.\nWith the brain side of the inserts still up, place the 6-well plate back on the inserts. This ensures that the cell suspension is trapped between the membrane and the actual bottom of the well (Figure 1C). Avoid air bubbles in the cell suspension, as it will prevent the homogeneous spread of the astrocytes on the membrane.\nPlace the plate and inserts, with the brain side up, in the incubator (at 37 °C with 5% CO­2) to allow the cell adhesion for a minimum of 2 h (murine immortalized astrocytes) and up to 6 h (human primary astrocytes).\nNOTE: As the inserts are maintained upside down, visualization of the cell adhesion is not possible under a microscope. It is, therefore, recommended to seed a separate regular cell culture vessel and control the cell adhesion in the vessel over time. Careful manipulation of the membrane is a must as the results will be unreliable when membranes are damaged.",
    "At the end of the incubation time, verify the absence of cell suspension leaks outside of the seeding area, and discard the inserts if they are leaky. Revert the 6-well plate to its regular position, with inserts that will now have the blood side up (Figure 1A). Add 2.6 mL of ABM+ to each well. Pour 2.5 mL of complete astrocyte medium into each insert and place the plate in the incubator (at 37 °C with 5% CO­2).\nPreparation of endothelial cells\nNOTE: For the murine brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEND3), the cells must reach 100% confluence to ensure maximal cell-cell contacts triggering the optimal tight junction protein expression on the day of the experiment. This does not apply for the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuAR2T) as the presence of astrocytes is required for a tight junction protein expression for these cells.\n\t\nProceed as previously described for the astrocytes (steps 1.1.1 and 1.1.2.). Once centrifuged, carefully discard the supernatant; resuspend the endothelial cell pellet in 1 mL of complete endothelial cell culture medium (EBM+) by slowly pipetting the cell suspension on the tube’s wall up to 5x. Avoid excessive pipetting of the cells to limit the stress on the cells. Count the cells and adjust the cell suspension density to 2 x 105 cells in 2.5 mL/insert of endothelial cell culture medium devoid of serum (EBM-) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A).\nTake out the plate containing the inserts, carefully discard the medium from the blood side, and replace it with 2.5 mL of the endothelial cell suspension. Return the plate to the incubator (at 37 °C with 5% CO­2) and leave it overnight for the endothelial cells to adhere to the membrane.",
    "The next day, prepare a sterile 6-well plate by transferring 3 mL of prewarmed serum-free astrocyte medium (ABM-) to each well. By handling the inserts with sterile forceps, carefully discard the endothelial complete medium from the blood side, place the insert in the new plate containing ABM-, and add 2.5 mL of EBM-.\nNOTE: The use of EBM- is critical for the establishment of the endothelial barrier (please refer to the discussion section).\nLeave the inserts in the incubator (at 37 °C with 5% CO­2) with minimal physical disturbance and temperature variations for 5 days, allowing the production of the endothelial basement membrane, astrocyte contacts with endothelial cells, and eventually, the BBTB mimic formation. Replace the medium on the day of the transfer on glioma cell cultures (please refer to section 1.4).\nMeasurement of the BBTB mimic permeability (optional)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59384/59384eq1.jpg\nPassive diffusion of the small-molecular-weight fluorescent dye sodium-fluorescein (Na-Fl) over time from the blood to the brain side of the inserts allows the calculation of the permeability values according to the following formula:\n\t\t​Here, dFwell is the fluorescence value measured in the well at a certain time point minus the cell culture medium autofluorescence value, dT is the time in seconds, A is the surface of the barrier in square centimeters, and dFinsert is the fluorescence value measured in the insert at the same time point minus the medium autofluorescence value).\nCollect 100 µL of the medium from both the blood and the brain sides of the BBTB mimic and transfer each of them to a separate flat-bottomed, black 96-well plate for subsequent fluorescence measurements. Use the plain media as the blank to correct the autofluorescence.",
    "Prepare 2.5 mL per well of the Na-Fl (50 µM) in EBM-. Prewarm the Na-Fl solution to 37 °C. Replace the media from the blood side of the inserts with the media containing Na-Fl. Start a timer as soon as the medium is replaced.\nCarefully collect 100 µL of media from both the blood and the brain side of the inserts at 5, 30, 60, and 120 min. Transfer each sample to separate wells of the black 96-well plate.\nAccordingly, replace the collected media from the inserts to maintain the volume balance between both sides. Place the inserts back in the incubator between each sample collection to minimize the temperature variations.\nQuantify the fluorescence from the collected samples, using a plate reader with the filter set on 480/560 nm (excitation and emission, respectively).\nNOTE: Fluorescence from the brain side is nearly undetectable at the 5 min time point. High values compared to the blank indicate a leak of/damage to the insert’s membrane or the barrier; therefore, exclude these from further analyses. Expected Na-Fl permeability values for the BBTB should be in the 10-5 to 10-6 cm/s range (Table 1).\nPreparation of glioma cells\nNOTE: Although patient-derived glioblastoma spheres are used here, the following protocol can be easily adapted for adherent, commercially available glioblastoma cells such as U-87MG.\n\t\nOptionally, for immunofluorescence imaging, place up to four round sterile borosilicate coverslips (ø 0.9 cm) per well in a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of poly-D-lysine (0.01%). Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nMeanwhile, carefully transfer the tumor spheres from the cell culture vessel to a 15 mL sterile tube using a sterile serological pipet. Centrifuge the tumor spheres for 3 min at 250 rcf.",
    "Discard the supernatant, gently resuspend the spheres in 1 mL of bFGF/EGF-free (GBM-) glioma cell medium and count the cells. Adjust the cell density to approximately 104 spheres/mL (105 cells/mL) in GBM-.\nDiscard the poly-D-lysine from the wells and rinse them 3x with sterile PBS. Seed the plate with 3 mL/well of the tumor spheroid suspension and transfer the inserts with the BBB mimic on the tumor cell suspension.\nIncubate overnight (at 37 °C with 5% CO­2) to allow equilibrium between the blood and the brain tumor sides of the assay. On the next day, replace the media in the blood side with EBM- supplemented with the molecules/drugs/nanoparticles of interest. Samples are collected over time for direct quantification as described in the previous section. Cells are fixed at a precise time point for fluorescence imaging (please refer to  the sections 2.1 and 2.2).\n2. High-resolution Confocal Imaging of the BBTB\nNOTE: 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, pH 7.4, 6 mL per BBTB replicate) is always prepared fresh in PBS. Keep it on ice.\nCAUTION: PFA is carcinogenic. Use nitrile gloves to handle PFA and prepare the solution under a chemical fume hood.\nBBTB endothelial expression of tight junction proteins\nRinse both sides of the membrane with ice-cold PBS (3x for 5 min, 2.5 mL/insert, 3 mL/well). Discard the PBS and add 3 mL and 2.5 mL of ice-cold 4% PFA in the well and in the insert, respectively. Incubate on ice for 10 min. Discard the PFA (according to the institution’s hazardous chemical disposal) and rinse 3x with PBS at RT (2.5 mL/insert, 3 mL/well).\nNOTE: Once fixed, samples can be stored in PBS (2.5 mL/insert, 3 mL/well) at 4 °C for a week.",
    "Use a cotton swab to wipe the brain side of the insert and remove the astrocytes. Using a sharp scalpel, carefully cut the membrane into four equal pieces by making two perpendicular cuts, forming a cross. Next, insert the scalpel at the point where the membrane is attached to the insert wall and rotate the insert with the other hand to liberate the four samples. Using fine tweezers, carefully transfer each sample to a 24-well plate containing 200 µL of PBS/well, with the blood side up in each well.\nBlock the membranes with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (for 30 min at RT, 200 µL/well). Prepare the 1° antibody solution for the immunostaining of the tight junction proteins (Figure 1D) (zonula occludens-1, claudin-5; please refer to the Table of Materials) in 200 µL of blocking solution/well. Optionally, endothelial cell identity is verified by adding an antibody raised against the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1 or CD31; please refer to the Table of Materials) to each tight junction antibody solution. Discard the blocking solution and incubate with the primary antibodies’ O/N at 4 °C.\nOn the next day, discard the primary antibodies and rinse them with 200 µL of PBS (3x for 5 min at RT). Incubate them with appropriate species-specific fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution, 200 µL/well, diluted in blocking solution; please refer to the Table of Materials) for 2 h at RT.",
    "Discard the secondary antibodies, rinse with 200 µL of PBS (3x for 5 min at RT). Remove the PBS and counterstain the cell nuclei by using a 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL in pure distilled H2O (dH2O; 200 µL/well; please refer to the Table of Materials). Incubate for 7 min at RT. Remove the DAPI and wash the membranes 3x with dH2O (200 µL/well).\nPlace a drop of the mounting medium (see the Table of Materials) on a glass microscope slide. Using fine tweezers, carefully take the membrane out of the well, and keeping the orientation, remove the excess of dH2O and place it on the drop of the mounting medium. Add another drop of mounting medium on top of the membrane and carefully cover it with a borosilicate cover glass. Ensure that there are no entrapped air bubbles. Store the samples at 4 °C and away from light until confocal microscopy observations.\nNOTE: Astrocyte staining can be performed by placing the pieces of the membranes in the 24-well plate with the brain side up, and with the use of selected astrocyte-specific antibodies (e.g., directed against the glial fibrillary acid protein [GFAP]) (Figure 1E).\nBBTB fluorescence staining to detect nanoparticle transcytosis \nPerform live-cell lysosome labeling (e.g., using fluorescent probes [see the Table of Materials]). Dilute the lysosome fluorescent dye at a working concentration of 50 nM in prewarmed EBM- (2.5 mL/insert) or of 75 mM in prewarmed ABM- (3 mL/well) for the lysosome labeling of endothelial cells and astrocytes, respectively. Incubate the cells for 45 min (at 37 °C with 5% CO­2); then, rinse 3x with ice-cold PBS (2.5 mL/insert, 3 mL/well).",
    "Discard the PBS and add 3 mL and 2.5 mL of ice-cold 4% PFA to the well and to the insert, respectively. Incubate them on ice for 10 min. Discard the PFA and rinse the cells 3x with PBS (at RT, 2.5 mL/insert, 3 mL/well).\nNOTE: Once fixed, the samples can be stored in PBS (2.5 mL/insert, 3 mL/well) at 4 °C for a week.\nRemove the PBS and counterstain the cell nuclei by using a DAPI solution at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL in dH2O (1 mL/insert, 1 mL/well). Incubate them for 7 min at RT. Remove the DAPI and wash the membranes 3x with dH2O (2.5 mL/insert, 3 mL/well).\nCarefully cut the membrane, remove the excess of dH2O, and place it on a drop of mounting medium (see the Table of Materials) on a glass microscope slide. Add another drop of mounting medium on the other side of the membrane and carefully cover it with a borosilicate cover glass. Avoid entrapped air bubbles. Store the samples at 4 °C and keep them protected from light until confocal microscopy imaging.\nFluorescence staining of tumor cells\nUsing fine tweezers, carefully transfer the round coverslips containing the tumor spheres to a 24-well plate filled with ice-cold PBS. Proceed with live-cell lysosome labeling using fluorescent lysosome probes at 75 nM in prewarmed GBM- (200 µL/well). Incubate the samples for 45 min; then, rinse them 3x with ice-cold PBS (200 µL/well).\nDiscard the PBS and add 200 µL of ice-cold PFA per well. Incubate on ice for 10 min. Discard the PFA and rinse the samples 3x with PBS (at RT).\nNOTE: Once fixed, the samples can be stored in PBS (200 µL) at 4 °C for a week.",
    "Remove the PBS and counterstain the cell nuclei by using a DAPI solution at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL in dH2O (200 µL/well). Incubate them for 7 min at RT. Remove the DAPI and wash the coverslips 3x with dH2O (200 µL/well).\nUsing fine tweezers, take out the coverslip, remove the excess of dH2O, and place it on a drop of mounting medium (see the Table of Materials) on a glass microscope slide. Avoid entrapping any air bubbles. Store the samples at 4 °C and keep them protected from light until confocal microscopy observations.\n3. In Vivo Comparative Study\nIn situ recording of sodium-fluorescein diffusion through the BBB\nPrepare 150 µL of a 50 nM Na-Fl solution in a physiological solution. Keep the solution at 37 °C upon intravenous delivery.\nAnesthetize a mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (300 µL of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine in PBS). Once deep anesthesia is established, place the animal on a heating pad to maintain its body temperature.\nNOTE: Ten-week-old female Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) nude immunocompromised mice have been used to obtain the data presented in Figure 2. However, this protocol is adapted to both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. The anesthesia/analgesia method is at the scientist’s discretion. However, inhalation anesthesia such as isoflurane is not recommended as it significantly increases the BBB permeability18.",
    "Place the mouse on a stereotaxic frame (see the Table of Materials) and perform a longitudinal incision of the scalp with fine scissors, followed by gentle dilacerations of the connective tissue, using fine tweezers, to reveal the skull. Using circular movements with a fine microdrill, remove a ø 0.3 mm circular piece of the skull from the left or right parietal bone. Proceed with extreme caution during the drilling and while removing the skull piece to avoid injuring the underlying meningeal tissue and blood vessels.\nPlace a drop of physiological solution on the exposed tissue. Using two pairs of fine forceps, carefully remove the meningeal tissue to access the brain cortex. The brain tissue should never be in direct contact with air.\nNOTE: Minor hemorrhages from meningeal injury can be stopped using hematologic sponges (please refer to the Table of Materials).\nOnce the meningeal tissue is removed and the cortex is fully exposed, entrap a drop of physiological solution between the cortex and a ø 0.5 mm borosilicate coverslip. Secure the observation area with a drop of cyanoacrylate glue (please refer to the Table of Materials) spread around the coverslip with a needle. Let the glue dry for 1 min.\nPrepare the implantable catheter for the tail vein injection (Figure 2A). Break the tip of a 25 G needle using Rochester-Ochsner forceps and insert the tip in a 10 cm-long PE20 polyurethane tube (please refer to the Table of Materials) (Figure 2A).",
    "Insert the catheter into the lateral tail vein of the mouse, using bulldog clamps for the catheter manipulation and insertion (please refer to the Table of Materials) (Figure 2B). Secure the inserted needle with a drop of cyanoacrylate glue. Let the glue dry for 20 s before removing the bulldog clamp. Carefully connect the other end of the catheter to a 25 G needle connected to a syringe containing the Na-Fl solution (Figure 2B).\nNOTE: Do not clamp the tail with the bulldog clamp; it is only used for precise catheter handling. Proper catheter insertion can be confirmed by blood reflux into the transparent tubing.\nPlace the animal under the stereomicroscope (see the Table of Materials). Using the low-level autofluorescence in the green channel (480 nm), focus on a region containing relatively large blood vessels (they appear darker due to the hemoglobin absorption of light at this wavelength) and smaller capillaries (Figure 2C). Start the time-lapse acquisition briefly before injecting the fluorescent dye to get a measurement of the background fluorescence.\nNOTE: Alternatively, the time-lapse recording can be replaced by snapshot pictures from T0 and from any other predetermined time points.\nInject the solution at a slow and continuous pace, or alternatively, use an automated infusion system. The Na-Fl fluorescence detected in the blood should remain stable (half-life in blood: 286 min), which allows a recording of the BBB diffusion through the cranial window for several minutes. Once the acquisition is complete, carefully remove the catheter and euthanize the animal by cervical dislocation.\nIn vivo determination of the BBB permeability\nNOTE: Values are obtained from any image-processing software, such as ImageJ, allowing the measurement of the fluorescence signal intensity inside a custom region of interest (ROI).",
    "Using the annotation tool, draw a rectangle-shaped ROI outside a blood vessel, in the brain tissue, at around 5 µm distance from any visible blood vessels filled with Na-Fl. Note the dimensions of the ROI and the measured fluorescence intensity at T0 in that ROI, which is used as blank for the tissue’s autofluorescence. Without displacing the ROI, fast-forward to a postinjection time point (e.g., to the very last recorded frame when the whole solution has been injected to the animal) and note the precise time and fluorescence values measured within the ROI (Figure 2C).\nMove the ROI on a visible blood vessel (Figure 2C) and note the T0 autofluorescence value from the blood. Without displacing the ROI, fast-forward to the same time point as defined in step 3.2.1. and note the fluorescence value measured within the ROI (Figure 2C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59384/59384eq2.jpg\nUse the following formula (adapted from section 1.3) to determine the BBB permeability:\nHere, dFbrain is the fluorescence intensity value minus the T0 blank value in the brain, dT is the acquisition time point in seconds, A is the approximate vessel surface area, taken as the ROI area in square centimeters, and dFblood is the fluorescence intensity value minus the T0 blank value in blood.\n\t\tNOTE: Expected permeability values for the BBB should be in the 10-6 cm/s range (Table 1).\nTissue processing for the detection of fluorescent nanoparticles in the murine brain\nImplant patient-derived glioblastoma spheres (5 x 104 cells in 5 µL of sterile PBS) in anesthetized 6-week-old female NMRI nude mice in the corpus callosum. Locate this brain region at the following stereotaxic coordinates, starting from the Bregma: anteroposterior + 0.5 mm, left to right + 2.5 mm, dorsoventral + 3 mm. Allow the brain tumor to grow for 2 weeks.",
    "Inject the nanoparticles intravenously (100 µg in 100 µL of sterile physiological solution) and allow them to circulate for 8 h. Inject the control mice intravenously with 100 µL of sterile physiological solution.\nEuthanize the mice by cervical dislocation and collect the brains rapidly for snap-freezing in isopentane maintained on dry ice (1 min at -50 °C). Store the brains at -80 °C until tissue processing.\nCut coronal brain sections with a cryomicrotome. Locate the intracranial implantation by the scar it formed on the cortex and cut 9 µm-thick sections from that area onto the appropriate microscope slides (see the Table of Materials).\nImmerse the brain sections that are immobilized on the slides in ice-cold PBS (2x for 5 min) and, then, fix them in ice-cold 4% PFA (for 5 min). Wash the slides in PBS (3x for 5 min at RT). Place the slides horizontally and pipet the blocking solution containing 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS on the tissue sections covering the entire surface (for 1 h at RT, 500 µL/slide). Prepare the CD31 antibody (please refer to the Table of Materials) in 250 µL of blocking solution/slide. Replace the blocking solution with the antibody and incubate overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber.\nThe next day, immerse the slides in PBS (3x for 5 min at RT) and incubate them with the corresponding fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 in 250 µL of PBS for 2 h at RT). Rinse 3x in PBS (at RT) and counterstain the cell nuclei by using a DAPI solution at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL in dH2O (250 µL/slide). Incubate the samples for 7 min at RT. Remove the DAPI solution and wash the slides 3x with dH2O.",
    "On each tissue section, add one drop of mounting medium (please refer to the Table of Materials) and secure the samples with a coverslip. Avoid entrapping air bubbles. Store the samples at 4 °C and keep them protected from light until confocal microscopy observations."
