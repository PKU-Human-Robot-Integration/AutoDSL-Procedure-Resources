    "All animal experiments were approved and carried out following the policies of the Animal Ethics Committee and the Genetic Recombinant Experiment Safety Committee at the University of Tokyo. Both male and female CX3CR1-GFP mice, aged 2-4 months, were used in the experiments. For the safety of the experimenters and the maintenance of sterile conditions, all the procedures were performed with white coats, masks, and sterile gloves. All instruments were sterilized before use. \n1. Preparation of instruments and animals\nAssemble a glass-bottom metal tube (Figure 1A).\n\t\nApply a small drop of UV-curing optical adhesive to one end of a custom-made stainless tube (outer diameter 3.0 mm, inner diameter 2.8 mm, height 1.7 mm). Spread the glue on the circular edge of the tube uniformly.\n\t\tNOTE: A sufficient amount of adhesive should be used to cover the entire edge of the tube.\nPlace a circular glass coverslip (3.0 mm diameter, 0.15 ± 0.02 mm thickness) to the glue-covered end of the metal tube, and lightly press the coverslip against the tube so that the gap between the tube and the glass is filled with the glue. Next, adjust the position of the glass to fit within the outer edge of the metal tube.\nIrradiate the glass with UV light for a sufficient time to cure the adhesive.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that the glass and the tube are completely attached. If the adhesion is insufficient, the glass may come off after surgery, resulting in unsuccessful imaging or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nDisinfect the assembled glass-bottom metal tube with 70% ethanol and wash with sterile saline to remove debris.\nSterilize all surgical instruments with a dry heat sterilizer.\nPrepare mice for the surgery of window implantation.",
    "​NOTE: Mice should be of appropriate age. It is preferable that they are genetically engineered to express fluorescent proteins in the CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG). These points are further explained in the Discussion section.\n2. Anesthesia and head fixation\nAnesthetize a mouse by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine). Administer meloxicam (2 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection for pre-operative analgesia. Confirm the disappearance of the response to painful stimuli, such as tail pinching to ensure adequate depth of anesthesia. Add a half dose of ketamine-xylazine each time the anesthesia wears off during surgery, typically 1 h after the initial administration and every 30 min thereafter. Use a heating pad under the body to provide thermal support and apply ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness under anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: The choice of anesthesia for surgery is essential. This point is discussed in detail in the Discussion section.\nApply depilatory cream to remove hair from the scalp. Disinfect the scalp several times in a circular motion with povidone-iodine scrub followed by alcohol. Place the mouse on the surgical platform prepared with a sterile waterproof pad and apply sterile drapes to secure the surgical site. Then, cut and remove the scalp circularly with a scalpel so that the parietal and the occipital bones are fully exposed on the operative side.\nRemove the subcutaneous connective tissue by rubbing it with a cotton swab while applying sterile saline to clear the bleeding. Gently scrape the cranial surface with a round-tipped miniature knife to remove the periosteum, which helps to strengthen the adhesion between the cement and the bone (see step 2.6).\nApply dental etching material to the entire surface, wait for tens of seconds, and rinse with sufficient sterile saline.",
    "Using waterproof ink, mark the area of the bone to be removed (a circular area with a diameter of 3.0 mm, centered about 2.5 mm posterior and 2.5 mm lateral to the bregma). After marking, dry the skull surface thoroughly.\n\tNOTE: The position of craniotomy depends on the size of the hippocampus and should be optimized for different ages. Useful indicators for the position of craniotomy will be presented below (see step 3.4.5, NOTE).\nAttach the rectangular aluminum plate with a thickness of 1.0 mm and with a 5.0 mm diameter hole at the center to the skull using dental resin cement according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\nCarefully align the hole at the center of the plate with the circular area marked with a pen (see step 2.5) so that the aluminum plate is parallel to the marked surface of the skull (Figure 1B). Ensure that the cement tightly seals all gaps between the plate and the bone. Wait for about 5 min for the cement to be sufficiently hardened.\nPlace the mouse onto the head holding device with angle adjusters via the attached plate.\n3. Implantation of the observation window\nNOTE: The following surgical procedures should be performed under a stereo microscope.\nMake a circular groove on the skull using a dermal punch with a diameter of 3.0 mm. Align the circular groove and the area marked with a pen in step 2.5. Twist the dermal punch with gentle pressure so that the groove depth gradually increases. Frequently check that the groove depth is constant over the entire circumference.\nWhen the dermal punch reaches the innermost layer of the cranium, before touching the underlying dura, gently lift the central bone island using a 30 G needle.",
    "NOTE: Slight liquid leakage from the bottom of the groove indicates that the groove is close to the dura.\nRemove the dura using a dura picker.\n\tNOTE: Complete removal of the dura within the cranial window is necessary and will require careful resection of the residual dura at the periphery using fine forceps.\nGently aspirate the tissue to expose the alveus of the hippocampus by 23 G or 25 G blunt needles connected to the aspirator.\n\tNOTE: This step is the most critical for successful imaging. Key technical points for the tissue aspiration are described in detail in the Discussion section.\n\t\nAspirate the pia and the pial vessels.\nAspirate the cortical tissue from the surface. Keep the depth of exposed tissue surface homogeneous over the entire cranial window. Gradually deepen the aspiration until fibers of the external capsule are exposed.\nCarefully position the suction tip to the external capsule near the lateral ventricle (LV) located at the rostrolateral end of the cranial window. Remove the surface layer of the external capsule running in the caudomedial to rostrolateral direction, and then the inner layer running in the mediolateral direction.\n\t\tNOTE: The external capsule near the LV can be easily removed from the underlying structure.\nConfirm the removal of the entire external capsule by checking the full exposure of the surface of the alveus and the dorsal hippocampal commissure (DHC).",
    "NOTE: The DHC covers the caudomedial portion of the CA1. The alveus and the DHC can be distinguished from the external capsule by their fiber orientations. Namely, the fibers within the alveus and the DHC run in the rostromedial to caudolateral direction, and can be distinguished from the fibers in the external capsule. The alveus and the DHC are tightly attached to the CA1 and should not be damaged. All fragments of the external capsule should be removed, since any remaining fragments will prevent the direct contact of the glass coverslip to the alveus.\nConfirm that the bleeding has stopped thoroughly and fill the hole with sterile saline to the level of the skull surface.\n\t\tNOTE: The field of view here helps to judge whether the hole is in the appropriate position for the specific age of the mouse. Ideally, the alveus and the underlying CA1 should occupy most of the central area. A part of the DHC is visible in the caudomedial area. The opening of LV is detectable at the rostrolateral edge (Figure 3A).\nInsert the glass-bottom metal tube (see step 1.1) vertically into the hole while aspirating the excess water that overflows from the sides of the tube until the glass bottom lightly presses against the alveus and partially flattens the underlying CA1.\n\tNOTE: This pressure needs to be adjusted appropriately. If it is too strong, the CA1 will be damaged. If it is too weak, the spherical aberration due to the curvature of the CA1 will impair imaging resolution in deep structures.",
    "Using dental resin cement, fix the wall of the inserted tube to the surrounding skull (Figure 1C). Ensure that the entire circumference is tightly sealed and that there is no leakage of air or CSF. Wait for about 5 min for the cement to harden.\n\tNOTE: If the cement is placed when its viscosity is low, it may leak into the brain parenchyma through the gap between the tube and the skull and damage the brain. Therefore, the cement should be applied after polymerization initiation, which increases the viscosity and reduces leakage through the gap.\nWash the entire plate, the skull, and the inside of the tube with sterile saline to remove debris.\n4. Two-photon microscopy immediately after surgery for quality check of the surgery\nSet the mouse in the head-holding device under the objective lens of the two-photon microscope and on the motorized XY scanning stage. Use a heating pad for thermal support. Monitor and adjust the depth of anesthesia as described in Step 2.1, as this quality check may take up to 30 mins. \n\tNOTE: The water-immersion objective lens with a working distance (WD) longer than 3 mm and a high numerical aperture (NA) is recommended. A correction collar of the objective lens can improve the resolution by compensating for the refractive index mismatch between the glass and the biomaterials.\nFill the space between the glass and the objective lens with water, taking special care to avoid air bubbles. If necessary, expand the area of the metal plate using a plastic film, which holds more water, to cover the entire front lens of the objective.\nTurn on a femtosecond pulsed laser of 920 nm wavelength for the excitation of the fluorescent probes expressed in the brain and start image acquisition software.",
    "Adjust the focus to the CA1 with the use of the motorized stage and the motorized focus system. Position the target structure with the guidance of the fluorescence emitted from the brain parenchyma and the reflected light from the edge of the metal tube under continuous illumination by the pulsed laser.\nMeasure the depths of the brain parenchyma touching the glass bottom by adjusting the focus with the motorized focus system. Compare the depths at different horizontal locations to judge the alignment of the glass bottom and the imaging plane.\n\t\nAdjust the angle of the mouse head by tilting the head holding device until the glass bottom is set to be parallel to the imaging plane.\nAdjust the correction collar of the objective to achieve the highest resolution at the depth of the target structure in the CA1.\nConfirm that the fluorescent cells in the molecular layer (ML) of the DG upper blade at a depth of 500 µm from the glass bottom can be imaged in the entire field of view.\n\tNOTE: This step is important in judging the quality of surgery. If the CA1 is damaged, focal brain edema prevents fluorescence detection at a depth of more than 200 µm from the surface. Only when there is no damage to the CA1, and the curvature of the CA1 layers is properly flattened by the overlying coverslip, the DG signals can be detected immediately after surgery (Figure 2A-D). The Representative Results section provides a simple way to determine the boundary between the CA1 and the DG.\n5. Postoperative care\nAspirate the water inside the tube and cover it with a plastic seal to prevent debris from entering.\nKeep the mouse warm and wait for recovery from the anesthesia.",
    "Administer meloxicam (2 mg/kg) subcutaneously every 24 h as long as the mouse exhibits pain-related behavior.\nRaise the postoperative mouse in individual housing for several weeks.\n6. In vivo chronic two-photon imaging of microglia using CX3CR1-GFP mice\nAfter induction of anesthesia, wash the inside of the metal tube with sterile saline to remove debris. Ensure that the white alveus of the hippocampus is visible through the glass (Figure 3A) and there are no complications such as postoperative bleeding.\nSet the mouse under the two-photon microscope following steps 4.1 to 4.6.\nCheck the quality and intensity of images obtained by two-photon excitation of the hippocampus (Figure 3B). Ensure that the images taken after the reduction of postoperative edema are comparable to or better than those taken on the day of the surgery (Figure 2A, see step 4.5).\n\tNOTE: Image deterioration indicates the presence of tissue damage inside the brain.\nEnsure that microglia have already recovered their ramified morphology (Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: The imaging data of microglia indicates that at least 3-4 weeks are required for microglia to return to their basal state.\nPerform in vivo imaging in any layers of the CA1 for the particular purpose of the experiment."
