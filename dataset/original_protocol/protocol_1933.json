HEK293T cells should be of low passage number, in log-phase, of high viability (e.g., >90%), and non-confluent at time of harvesting.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1529-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Initial cell culture and transfection\n(A) Cells are removed from the tissue culture incubator are dislodged from the tissue culture dish with Trypsin-EDTA and manual disruption following aspiration of the cell media.\n(B and C) (B) Cells are then gently centrifuged, media aspirated, (C) resuspended, and seeded into a new 10-cm tissue culture dish.\n(D and F) (D) DNA are diluted in OptiMEM (pink liquid) and incubated with TransIT-2020 (gray liquid) for 20 min before (E) DNA complexes are added drop-wise to the HEK293T cells from earlier and subsequently (F) returned to the tissue-culture incubator for incubation.\nUsing Trypsin-EDTA, harvest HEK293T cells for plating into 10 cm tissue culture dish.\nAspirate tissue culture media from initial dish and apply enough Trypsin-EDTA to cover the cells. Let sit for 3–5 min, gently agitating or tipping the dish from side-to-side (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nGently triturate cells by repeated aspiration and transfer dissociated cells to a 50 mL conical tube containing a greater or equal volume of complete DMEM (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nUsing a 22°C table-top centrifuge, pellet by centrifuging cells for 5 min at 250 × g (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nAspirate the supernatant leaving the gently pelleted cells at the bottom of the conical tube.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of complete DMEM by gentle trituration with a 1 mL pipette.",
    "Add 9 mL of complete DMEM and mix by gentle inversion before counting and assessing cell viability.\nGently and evenly distribute cells to a fresh 10 cm tissue culture dish containing 10–15 mL complete DMEM (final volume) at a density of 6.5–7 million cells per dish (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nReturn dish to the incubator.\n5–8 h after plating, prepare DNA reagents for transfection (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1529_7.csv\nBring Opti-MEM and TransIT-2020 (protected from light) to 22°C.\nDilute DNA in Opti-MEM for each component (DRD2, G  α  Z-RLuc8, G  β  3, and GFP2-G  γ  1) to 10 ng/μL.\nCombine diluted DNA at a ratio of 1:1:1:1, to a total concentration of 4 μg (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D; Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nFinal volume should be 400 μL maintaining DNA concentration at 10 ng/μL.\nAdd TransIT-2020 to the Opti-MEM/DNA mixture at a ratio of 3:1 TransIT-2020 (μL):DNA (μg) and gently mix/agitate by flicking (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nFor this protocol this is 12 μL of TransIT-2020.\nLet DNA complexes form for 20–30 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nRemove the tissue culture dish from step 2 from the incubator and evenly distribute DNA/Transit mixture dropwise into the tissue culture media (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nGently mix by moving the tissue culture dish in a slow figure eight motion.\nReturn the tissue culture dish to the incubator overnight (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nPreparation of the assay plate\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section details how to prepare a 384-well plate of transfected cells to be used in the TRUPATH assay.\nThe following day remove the tissue culture dish prepared the previous day from the incubator and transfer cells to a 384-well white tissue culture plate.\nThe 384-well white tissue culture plate should have been previously coated with Poly-L-Lysine as transfection of many cell types can reduce their adherence.",
    "1× Poly-L-Lysine solution should be made up at 100 μg/mL in sterile water + 1% Pen-Strep (v/v). Concentrated Poly-L-Lysine stocks can also be made, aliquoted, and frozen for use. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nDispense 30 μL of 1× Poly-L-Lysine solution via pipette or multidrop into each well of the 384-well plate. We prefer to then incubate the plates with the solution for 30–60 min at 37°C.\nShake out Poly-L-Lysine and add 30 μL of sterile H2O + 1% Pen-Strep (v/v) to each well. If wrapped and stored in the dark at 4°C, these plates can be saved and used within 2–3 weeks.\nBefore using the plate, shake out liquid and let dry in a sterile hood for 1 h.\nRetrieve the 10 cm tissue culture dish containing the transfected HEK293T cells from the previous day (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1529-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation of the assay plate\n(A) Cells are removed from the tissue culture incubator are dislodged from the tissue culture dish with Versene and manual disruption following aspiration of the cell media.\n(B–D) (B) Cells are then gently centrifuged, media aspirated, (C) resuspended and diluted to a density between 375 to 625 cells/μL, and (D) seeded into a Poly-L-Lysine coated 384-well tissue culture plate before being returned to the tissue-culture incubator.\nAspirate off media and harvest cells by gentle trituration using 4 mL of Versene to detach. More volume may be used as needed. Transfer cells to 50 mL conical tubes containing 6 mL 1% dFBS DMEM to quench the Versene. To aid in detachment, the cells can be washed gently with PBS or Versene, with fresh Versene added after. Using a 22°C table-top centrifuge, spin down the cells at 250× g for 5 min (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Aspirate off the supernatant from the pellet and add 1 mL of 1% dFBS DMEM to the cell pellet. Resuspend and dilute to 5 mL. Count cells, and adjust cell density between 375 and 625 cells/μL (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Ideal experimental conditions for cell density should be determined by the end user based on their observed growth rate.\nPlate 40 μL (15,000–25,000 cells) into each well of the coated 384-well plate using the repeater pipette or multidrop (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nIn the table-top centrifuge, spin the plates at 100× g for 15–30 s.\nReturn plates to the incubator for incubation overnight (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nRunning the assay, agonist mode\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section details how to perform the TRUPATH assay to determine the activity of agonists.\nNote: Drug plates can be prepared by hand or by assisted automation (e.g., an Integra Assist Plus or an Echo acoustic dispenser). In this protocol we have utilized drug plates made by an acoustic dispenser (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). We have also limited the final DMSO concentrations to 0.33% but tolerance in an assay can be determined by the end-user. We describe a protocol for a 3-fold dilution of compounds to their final concentration, however, these procedural conditions can be modified by the end-user. For this experimental set-up we also perform concentration-response-curves with half-log dilutions, starting at a concentration of 10ˆ-4.5 M. Finally, we describe the use of an Integra VIAFLO for resuspension of compounds, transfer of assay buffer and substrate, and addition of compounds.",
    "The following day, resuspend the drug plate by transferring 79.2 μL of drug buffer to each well (this assumes a 384-well drug plate prepared by an Echo acoustic dispenser in the required plate layout is being used, with each well containing 800 nL of compound or DMSO at 100× the desired concentration) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1529-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Drug plate format for 16 interleaved 10-point concentration-response curves in technical duplicate\nMin and max columns represent negative (DMSO, minimum response) and positive (maximal concentration of reference agonist) controls. For this experiment, 300 μM of dopamine in 0.99% DMSO (3×, final concentration of 100 μM, 0.33% DMSO) was used as the maximum control. Full-log dilutions of dopamine starting at 300 μM (100 μM) were used to create the curve in this experiment, but alternate dilutions schemes can be used as well. Drug plates prepared by the Echo acoustic dispenser performs dilutions by seeding low volumes of compound solution and back-filling with DMSO.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1529-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Running the assay\n(A) Compounds are resuspended using an Integra VIAFLO to transfer drug buffer to the drug plate from Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\n(B) Renilla Luciferase substrate (e.g., Prolume Purple) is resuspended in methanol to 1 mM and diluted in assay buffer to 7.5 μM.\n(C–F) (C) Media is removed by manual ejection from the tissue culture plate from Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and (D) replaced with diluted luciferase substrate (E). Resuspended compounds are added to the tissue culture plate containing transfected cells and substrate before (F) being loaded into the plate reader.\n(G) Finally, data are analyzed.\nDissolve BRET2 substrate such as Prolume Purple or coelenterazine 400a in methanol to a concentration of 1 mM (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).",
    "Store in the dark on dry ice during use and then wrap in Parafilm and store at −80°C following the experiment. Use within 1–2 weeks and then discard.\nShake out and blot the 384-well tissue culture plate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). Sometimes this will require a flick/shake, blot, then a reversal of the orientation and a repeat. It is important to make sure that as much of the DMEM is out and that this is even.\nAfter shaking out the cell culture media, place the PerkinElmer white backing strips (6005199) on the underside of the plate to create a white reflective bottom. If using assay plates which are already white-bottomed the adhesive strip can be skipped. For the 384-well plate format, vacuum aspiration and/or washing may result in detrimental cell loss. We have not experienced a significant interference of residual phenol red-containing media on the BRET signal, but to avoid this phenol-red free DMEM may be used when plating cells.\nDilute 75 μL of substrate (e.g., Prolume Purple) into 10 mL final volume of assay buffer (7.5 μM final concentration) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nLoad 20 μL of this solution into each of the wells in the cell plate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). This can be performed manually via pipetting or using a liquid handler such as an Integra VIAFLO.\nUsing the Integra VIAFLO fitted with a 12.5 μL 384 head, with the drug plate in the left position and the cell plate in the right position, transfer 10 μL of drugs to the cell plate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nIn a table-top centrifuge, spin the plates at 100× g for 10 s.\nLoad the plate into the PHERAstar FSX (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).",
    "Reading protocols can be adapted by the end user based on the results and requirements of their target. For this protocol we scan each well with a 3 mm spiral average, reading the plate 8 times over a period of 40 min.\nWe have found that EC50s for DRD2 stabilize rapidly in minutes, however these settings should be established by the end-user as unique for their targets.\nGain for GFP2 and RLuc8 channels should be optimized by the end-user as optics for plate readers even of the same build can vary, and signal intensity will differ depending on whether the end-user is using coelenterazine 400a or Prolume Purple. We typically use gain settings of 3800 for channel A (GFP2) and 3000 for channel B (RLuc8).\nExport the data from the plate reader for subsequent analysis (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G).\nAnalysis, agonist mode\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section details how to analyze the data obtained from TRUPATH agonist assays.\nNote: Software for analysis may vary depending on user preference. However, the overall method for curve-fitting is generalizable. Here we describe using GraphPad Prism and a 4-parameter logistic regression.\nCalculate the ratio of GFP2 signal to RLuc8 signal (i.e., GFP2 counts/RLuc8 counts). As TRUPATH is a G protein dissociation assay, a decrease in the ratio is inversely proportional to the magnitude of activation of the system.\nBRET values may be variable from experiment-to-experiment. Therefore, these values should be normalized for each experiment if possible.\nTransfer the data to an X/Y plot in GraphPad Prism.\nFor initial experiments with multiple time-points separate data-tables can be generated.\nUsing a 4-parameter logistic fit, calculate the EC50s and plot these by time (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). Identify the time-point where the EC50 values have stabilized and use this as the typical time-course for your target system (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1529-Fig6.jpg",

A decrease in BRET indicates a decrease in the associated (inactive) heteroterimeric G protein complexes (i.e., agonism of the DRD2 receptor).

Intersection of dotted-lines indicates the estimated concentration at the 80% point on the 4-parameter fitted curve. In this experiment the EC80 was estimated as 60 nM. After multiple internal replicates we identified a typical EC80 concentration of 30 nM.\nPlate statistics such as Z′ or Robust Z′ over time can also be calculated and used to determine when the assay is sufficiently robust, and for how long, as additional constraints on the reliability of the data for analysis.\nUsing the normalization function, normalize the change in BRET ratio with compound treatment using the average ratio-value from the minimum signal wells (DMSO only) as 0% and maximum signal wells (sufficient concentration of control compound to achieve a maximal response) wells as 100% (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nUsing these normalized values, perform a 4-parameter logistic fit regression. This will provide the end-user with estimates of Emin (bottom of curve), Emax (top of curves, and efficacy), EC50 (potency), and hill-slope.\nIn order to ensure robustness of the assay, independent biological replicates should be carried out over different days to ensure repeatability.\nIn preparation for running an antagonist-mode assay, the agonist stimulation condition that will be used as a competitor for potential antagonist compounds should be determined.",
    "It is general convention to use an EC80 concentration of the test agonist. Using the “log(Agonist) vs. response – Find ECanything” curve, set the ECF to 80. This will provide an output of the effective concentration at EC80 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C) rather than the typical EC50. This concentration of agonist can be used as a competitor for antagonist assays.\nRunning the assay, antagonist mode\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section details how to perform the TRUPATH assay to determine the activity of antagonists.\nNote: We generally perform the antagonist assay via co-addition of a mixture of agonist and antagonists.\nResuspend the drug plate by transferring 79.2 μL of drug buffer to each well (this assumes a 384-well drug plate with 800 nL of compound dissolved in DMSO). This can be done manually or via an automated liquid handler such as an Integra VIAFLO with a 384-well 125-μL head.\nThe drug plate should contain test compounds at the end user’s desired concentration for either single-point or concentration-response assays (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). However, each well containing a test antagonist should also contain the test agonist from the previous steps at an EC80 or other concentration. Control wells should consist of minimum (DMSO), maximum (sufficient concentration of test agonist to achieve a maximal response), and EC80 concentration of the test agonist.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1529-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

The data shown is the response from every well in a 384-well plate 30 min post-drug addition and dopamine was used at 100 μM for Max, 30 nM for EC80 and 4 nM for EC50 final concentrations.\nTransfer the data to an X/Y plot in GraphPad Prism, separating each signal condition into different groups, and plotting well number along the X-axis.\nProduce separate graphs for well number plotted by column then row (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A) and also by row then column (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]B), so any directional effects in the responses (such as drift or edge effects) on the plate can be assessed.\nUsing the normalization function, normalize the change in BRET ratio using the average BRET ratio of the Min signal wells as 0% and average BRET ratio of the Max signal wells as 100%.\nUsing these normalized values, create X/Y plots of the normalized data plotted by well number as in step 38 (Figures 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C and 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]D).",
