    "Buffer preparation (please refer to the end of the protocol for detailed recipes)Before the day of extraction, prepare the following base buffers and keep at 4 °C (may be kept for several weeks):Base buffer: 10 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Autoclave and keep at 4°C before use (Further components will be added on the day of extraction).Sucrose buffers: Dissolve sucrose in Base buffer to make three sucrose buffers at concentrations 1.2 M, 0.8 M and 0.4 M. Filter-sterilize or autoclave and keep at 4 °C.Note: Be careful when autoclaving sucrose solutions, as they caramelize easily. Autoclave for no more than 15 minutes at a maximum of 121 °C. Phosphate buffer: 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5. Prepare and autoclave.Nile red and BODIPY493/503 stocks. Keep at -20 °C.On the day of extraction, complete buffer preparation as follows:Supplement Base buffer with 0.2% (v/v) Tween-20, 2 mM PMSF and 2x Protease inhibitor cocktail.Mix equal volumes of supplemented Base buffer and each Sucrose buffer (1.2 M, 0.8 M and 0.4 M) to prepare Extraction buffer, Floating buffer 1 and Floating buffer 2, respectively.In the end, the final buffer composition will be:Extraction buffer: 0.6 M Sucrose, 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 1 mM PMSF, 1x Protease inhibitor cocktail.Floating buffer 1: 0.4 M Sucrose, 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 1 mM PMSF, 1x Protease inhibitor cocktail.Floating buffer 2: 0.2 M Sucrose, 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 1 mM PMSF, 1x Protease inhibitor cocktail.Lipid droplet extraction (Figure 1)Precool mortar and pestle on ice.Tip: A small amount of liquid nitrogen may be added to accelerate cooling, but not immediately before grinding, to avoid tissue freezing.",
    "In order to increase LD yield and quality, it is important that the tissue remains cool, but not frozen, during grinding. Collect tissue (2.5 g of fully expanded leaves). Using a scissor, cut leaves into small pieces (about 0.5 to 1 cm) and place them on the cold mortar.Note: LDs recovery will depend on experimental conditions. The starting amount proposed here (2.5 g) is sufficient for leaves under LD-inducing conditions, such as senescence and pathogen infection (Fernández-Santos et al., 2020). If this amount is not sufficient in your case, scale up to maximum 6.5 g per sample by using rotor SW41-Ti and 13 ml tubes. Add 5 g of sea sand (abrasive) and 5 ml of precooled extraction buffer. Grind for 2-3 min until a homogeneous mix is formed. Keep the mortar on ice while grinding.Pass the homogenate through 3 layers of Miracloth placed on a funnel, and collect the filtrate in a precooled 10 ml tube (you will have to squeeze the mix to extract the liquid). This should yield 2-3 ml of filtrate.Place 2.5 ml of filtrate in the ultracentrifuge tube using a P1000 pipette. On top of that, gently lay 2 ml of Floating buffer 1, taking care not to mix both phases.Tip: Use tube walls to carefully add the floating buffer. This will limit phase mixing. After completing this step, you should see a green bottom phase, an intermediate thin layer in which both phases are mixed and a clear top phase.Centrifuge 1.5 h at 100,000 x g and 4 °C (32,000 rpm if working with an SW55Ti rotor) with maximum acceleration and no brake.",
    "In this step, less dense LDs will float from the extract phase and through the Floating buffer 1, to accumulate as a milky band visible on top of the tube (Floating fraction 1, FF1).Collect FF1 very carefully, by aspiring with a P1000 pipette or a glass Pasteur pipette (~0.5-1 ml, maximum 1.5 ml) and place in a new ultracentrifuge tube.Note: Avoid plastic Pasteur pipettes, as LDs will stick to the walls making them hard to collect. Optional: To monitor extraction, also collect an aliquot from the bottom phase (Bottom fraction 1, BF1).If several samples are being processed, balance the volumes of FF1 fractions by adding Floating Buffer 1. On top of it, gently lay Floating buffer 2 taking the same precautions as in Step B5. As the total volume loaded into the tubes must be 4.5 ml, the added volume of Floating buffer 2 will be equal to 4.5 ml – VolFF1.Note: Liquid volume in the ultracentrifuge tubes used here should be around 4.5 ml. Higher volumes (close to 5 ml) may cause sample spill, whereas lower volumes (e.g., less than 4 ml) may cause tube collapse at high g forces. Centrifuge as in Step B6 and collect LDs from the floating milky band as in Step B7 (Floating fraction 2, FF2). FF2 can already be used as LD fraction (Figure 2A).Optional: To monitor extraction, also collect an aliquot of the bottom phase (Bottom fraction 2, BF2).If you need more concentrated LDs, place collected FF2 in a 1.5 ml tube and centrifuge for 1.5 h in a table centrifuge at 10,000 x g and 4 °C. After centrifugation, LDs will accumulate again on a top layer. Remove as much buffer as possible from the bottom of the tube with a glass pipette, until only the upper milky fraction remains.",
    "LDs can be concentrated to a volume as small as 50-100 μl (Figure 2B).Optional: Place the removed buffer in a new 1.5 ml tube and repeat the previous step to increase recovery.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3867/bioprotoc-10-24-3867-g001.jpgFigure 1. Protocol overview. Collect leaves, cut into small pieces and immediately place in a precooled mortar. After addition of abrasive and Extraction buffer, grind the sample and then filter through 3 layers of Miracloth. Place the filtrate in a 5 ml centrifuge tube, overlay Floating buffer 1 and centrifuge the resulting gradient. LDs will accumulate on top of the tube. Place this LD fraction (FF1) in a new tube and repeat the process using Floating buffer 2. If needed, concentrate the resulting LD fraction (FF2) by centrifugation in a table centrifuge.LD quality checkThe quality of your final LD preparation (or intermediate fractions) can be assessed by several methods listed below. The simplest is to observe the stained LDs under a fluorescence microscope. Optionally, you can also estimate yield, purity and homogeneity of your LD preparation by flow cytometry analysis. Western blot can also be used to set up your protocol, if you have an antibody against an LD protein.By microscopyExtracted LDs can be stained with lipid-specific dyes such as BODIPY493/503 or Nile Red; BODIPY493/503 is more sensitive and specific (Gocze and Freeman, 1994). In both cases, proceed as follows:Prepare working dye solutions: Dilute dye stocks 1,000 times to 1 μg/ml in Phosphate buffer.Gently mix equal volumes (e.g., 5 μl) of the final LD fraction and the working dye solution. Incubate for 15 min in the dark and observe in the fluorescence microscope. For BODIPY493/503, use a 488-nm excitation laser line and collect the emission signal in the spectrum of 500 to 540 nm.",
    "For Nile Red, excite with 550 nm laser and collect emission between 562 and 621 nm. (Alternatively, if this exact parameters cannot be set in your microscope, use typical GFP settings for BODIPY493/503 and RFP settings for Nile Red).    Compare fluorescence image with a bright filed image. You should see round, 0.5-2 μm structures overlapping in both pictures [Figure 2C-2D and           Horn et al. (2013)].By flow cytometryAs a complement to microscopy, BODIPY493/503-stained and unstained LDs can be analyzed in a flow cytometer to estimate yield, purity and possible different populations in the final LD preparation.Prepare working dye solution: Dilute BODIPY493/503 stock 10 times (to 100 μg/ml) in Phosphate buffer.Dilute 5 μl of the final LD fraction with 195 μl Phosphate buffer and add 1 μl of 100 μg/ml BODIPY493/503. Mix gently and stain for 15 min in the dark. In parallel, prepare an unstained control.Analyze stained and unstained samples on a GaliosTM flow cytometer. Excitation laser: 488 nm at 20 mW. Emission filter: 525-540 nm bandpass. If a good quality preparation is obtained, LDs should appear as a single cluster in a Size vs. Complexity plot. In a fluorescence histogram, BODIPY493/503 should produce a fluorescence shift of the majority of particles when comparing stained vs unstained samples (Fernández-           Santos et al., 2020). The number of recorded events (particles) in the fluorescence channel can be used to estimate LD yield (as LDs per mg fresh tissue).By Western blotTo set up your protocol, it is very useful to have a transgenic line with a tagged LD marker protein that can be detected by western blot (or an antibody against the LD protein per se). This way you can monitor LD enrichment (or depletion) in different fractions and adjust protocol conditions accordingly.",
