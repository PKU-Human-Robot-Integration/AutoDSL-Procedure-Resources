    "This prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled clinical study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University (XYFY2021-KL124-02). The study started in July 2021 and will continue until July 2023; 60 patients were recruited in this experiment. All patients signed an informed consent that allowed the researchers to use their clinical materials and biological data.\n1. Recruitment of patients\nInclusion criteria:\n\t\nEnsure that the patients' ages are between 18 years and 80 years (inclusive), regardless of gender.\nEnsure that the patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers meet the 1999 WHO diagnostic criteria14 and have a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≤10% as detected during the screening period or within 3 months prior to randomization.\nConfirm that the ankle-brachial index15 of the target limb is at least 0.8 without intermittent claudication.\nEnsure that each patient's ulcer has the following characteristics:\n\t\tGrade 1 or grade 2 according to the Wagner grading system16 for ulcers.\n\t\tLocation in the foot, ankle, or front shin.\n\t\tCross-sectional area after debridement of 2-5 cm2.\n\t\t​No pus or necrotic substance visible to the naked eye at least 4 weeks before randomization.\nDo not include patients undergoing routine treatment of other wounds in the study.\n\t\t\nIf multiple wounds are present, select the wound that meets the inclusion criteria and has the largest intervention and assessment area.\nIf two or more wounds are similarly large, select the one with the most severe grade.\nIf there are two or more wounds with the same area and grade, select the one with the longest wound duration.\nParticipation in this clinical study is voluntary. Ensure that the patients cooperate with the physicians conducting the study and sign an informed consent form.\nExclusion criteria:\n\t\nExclude patients with clear surgical indications: vascular occlusion, bone exposure, abscess, osteomyelitis.",
    "Exclude patients with revascularization or angioplasty within 3 months prior to enrollment.\nExclude patients with hepatic impairment; specifically, exclude patients with ALT (aspartate aminotransferase) and AST (alanine aminotransferase) levels three times higher than the upper limit of normal.\nExclude patients with blood creatinine levels more than two times above the upper limit of normal; serum albumin <2.0 g/dL; immunosuppressive drug treatment; various malignant tumors; and pregnancy, breastfeeding, or a recent birth plan.\nExclude patients with contraindications, allergies, or known allergies to any component of stem cell preparation products.\nExclude patients in other situations that cause the investigator to believe the patient should not participate in this study:\n\t\t\nExclude patients if it is discovered after admission that they do not meet the most important admission criteria.\nExclude patients with serious adverse reactions, patients who request to withdraw from the study, and patients whose legal guardian requests for them to withdraw from the study.\nExclude patients with a lack of medication or effective post-enrollment observational data.\nRandomization and blinding\n\t\nRandomize the patients recruited from the outpatient department of the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University on a 1:1 basis into the stem cell therapy group and the conventional wound treatment group.\nConduct a double-blind trial for the treatment. Ensure a third party measures the wound area of each patient.\n2. Preoperative treatment\nPerform routine pretreatment examinations for the patients after enrollment, including a routine blood test, urinalysis, a routine stool assessment, a biochemical function assessment, a coagulation function assessment, virology, etc. Ensure that patients are followed up in the same hospital to ensure the accuracy of the tests.",
    "Include patients who meet the inclusion criteria and have signed the written informed consent. Assign each subject randomly to either the stem cell therapy group or the conventional wound treatment group in a 1:1 ratio using a proportionate sampling technique.\n3. Treatment procedures\nNOTE: Patients in both groups receive systematic routine wound dressing changes every 3 days. For the stem cell treatment group, patients receive local injections of stem cells four times (on day 1, day 8, day 15, and day 22 after enrollment). In the conventional wound treatment group, the patients are treated with silver ion dressing four times (on day 1, day 8, day 15, and day 22 after enrollment). The specific steps are as follows.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65045/65045fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Treatment process.

Apply the sterile film transparent dressing with its coordinate grid to the wound surface, and outline the shape of the wound surface along its edge with a marker. Calculate the wound area according to the area of each coordinate grid of the film.\nInject the human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (2 x 105 cells/cm2; 0.4 mL/cm2) into the periphery and the base of the wound (injection spacing: 0.75 cm; injection volume: 0.1 mL/site).\n\t\tNOTE: The number of injections for each patient depends on the wound area.",
    "Trim the sterile dressing to appropriate size, cover it over the wound surface, and then bandage it.\nConventional wound treatment group\n\t\nAfter locally disinfecting the wound with iodophor and removing the necrotic tissue from the wound surface with surgical scissors, use a syringe to aspirate 50 mL of physiological saline to clean the wound surface inside and out.\nMeasure the wound area using the sterile foil edge hook method17.

Observation indicators\nObtain the demographic data of the subjects.\nRecord the concomitant treatments; specifically, record the wound status (location, area, depth, infection, and ischemia), the wound healing rate, the healing time, and complications.\nPerform laboratory tests. Take the wound secretion for swabs and bacteriological culture. Conduct routine blood tests and tests for liver and kidney function.\n5. Follow-up\nExamine the patients on the first day of therapy and during the follow-up visits 15 days and 30 days after the last therapy.\nConduct follow-ups using both outpatient and telephone appointments to record the treatment effects, condition changes, recovery situation, and current living status.\n6. Outcomes efficacy assessment\nConduct the clinical evaluation according to the following criteria.\n\t\nCalculate the primary outcome index:",
    "The 30 day wound healing rate = (original wound area − unhealed wound area at 30 days)/original wound area × 100%.\nCalculate the secondary outcome index\n\t\t\nWound healing time: Define the time of wound closure as the time at which the wound is completely re-epithelialized.\nCalculate the complete healing rate:\n\t\t\tThe complete healing rate = the number of complete healed cases/the total number of cases × 100%\nCalculate the surgical intervention rate:\n\t\tSurgical intervention rate = the number of surgical interventions/the total number of cases × 100%.\n\t\tNOTE: Subjects who underwent one of the following procedures are recorded as patients with surgical interventions: debridement and drainage, skin grafting, adjacent skin flap, distal skin flap, non-anastomotic skin flap, and amputation.\nPerform the bacterial culture18 according to the standard clinical inspection procedures, and record bacterial culture results of ≥1 pathogen as positive. Calculate the pathogen positive rate:\n\t\tPathogen positive rate = the number of cases detected pathogen positive/the total number of cases × 100%.\n7. Safety procedures\nIn the case of an adverse event (any disease, new symptoms, signs, or laboratory examination abnormalities or the deterioration of the original symptoms and signs occurring during the stem cell clinical research, regardless of whether the event is related to the clinical research drug or not), take the necessary measures for treatment and rescue.\nTrack and investigate all the adverse events and the treatment process, and record the results in detail until properly resolved or until the condition is stable. If a test is abnormal and has clinical significance, follow it up until it returns to normal.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
