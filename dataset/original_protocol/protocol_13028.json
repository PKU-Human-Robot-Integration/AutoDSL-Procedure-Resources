    "Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University (OSU, protocol 2007A0262-R4).\nNOTE: All procedures must be done in a class II biosafety cabinet with the blower on and the lights off.\n1. Preparation of materials\nNOTE: All materials are listed in the Table of Materials.\nPrepare Medium 1, centrifugation Medium 2, and storage and working solutions of fluorescent 2-deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) amino]-D-glucose (2-NBDG or FD-glucose) according to Table 1 in a Class II biosafety cabinet. Protect FD-glucose from light throughout the experiment by turning off all the lights under the hood.\nUse ready-to-use cell culture reagents: Trypsin-EDTA, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and glucose-free and phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (hereafter, glucose-free DMEM).\nUse 20 mL of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer.\n\t​NOTE: In the following sections, extracellular depletion and intracellular uptake of different FD-glucose doses are compared in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with and without insulin stimulation (Figure 2).\n2. 3T3-L1 cell culture and maintenance\nCulture 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts by plating 1 x 106 cells diluted in 20 mL of Medium 1 in two 96-well plates. Plate 100 μL of cell suspension per well, ensuring to maintain homogeneity of this suspension by mixing. Grow cells for 48 h in a 37 °C incubator (5% CO2 and 95% humidity) without changing media until about 70%-80% confluency.\nMaintain cells confluent and fasted by culturing them in the same medium for 48 h. Vary the incubation time from 24-72 h depending on the desired fasting catabolic state.\n3. Starvation of 3T3-L1 cells\nDecant media from cells in the 96-well plates. Absorb the remaining fluid using sterile paper towels.\nRinse the 96-well plate with 100 μL of PBS per well and absorb the remaining fluid with sterile paper towels.",
    "Add 100 μL of glucose-free DMEM per well and incubate for 40 min. Adjust the time of incubation depending on cell type, stimuli, and desired level of fasting.\n\t​NOTE: The time of incubation may require optimization depending on the season.\n4. Preparation of FD-glucose solutions with different concentrations\nNOTE: The experiment in Figure 2 examines extracellular and intercellular media with and without stimulation with insulin.\nUse eight replicates (one row in a 96-well plate) for each stimulation condition. Therefore, prepare 1 mL for each stimulation condition (specified in Table 2 and below).\nUse eight stimulation conditions without insulin: FD-glucose of 2.5 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 0.5 μg/mL, 0.2 μg/mL, 0.1 μg/mL, 0.05 μg/mL, and 0 μg /mL (control without FD-glucose) in one 96-well plate.\nUse eight stimulation conditions with insulin (10 μg/mL, final concentration): FD-glucose of 2.5 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 0.5 μg/mL, 0.2 μg/mL, 0.1 μg/mL, 0.05 μg/mL, and 0 μg/mL (control without FD-glucose) in another 96-well plate.\nTo prepare stimulation conditions, dilute 1 μL of 5 mg/mL FD-glucose working solution (Table 1) in 999 μL of glucose-free DMEM to obtain 1 mL of working stock solution (1:1000 dilution or 5 μg/mL).\n\t\nUsing this working stock solution, prepare 1:2000, 1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:25,000, 1:50,000, and 1:100,000 dilutions of FD-glucose to obtain 2.5 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 0.5 μg/mL, 0.2 μg/mL, 0.1 μg/mL, and 0.05 μg/mL (Table 2) in 2 mL tubes immediately before experiments in a biosafety cabinet without lights.\nRepeat step 4.4 and add 1 μL of insulin (10 mg/mL, final concentration) to each of the conditions specified above.\n\t​NOTE: The final concentration of insulin in these samples is 10 μg/mL = 1.7 nmol/mL. To achieve homogenization, add insulin to the tubes before adding other solutions.\n5. Treating starved 3T3-L1 cells",
    "After 40 min of incubation, decant the glucose-free DMEM from each well in 96-well plates and absorb the remaining fluid with sterile paper towels.\nAdd 100 μL (per well) each from the various treatment conditions described above to wells along one column, and 100 μL (per well) from the same treatment condition to the wells along the row (eight replicates) in both 96-well plates. Label the plates that utilized the conditions with and without insulin. Add glucose-free DMEM alone to the control wells (n = 8).\nIncubate the plate for 40 min in a cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity) in the dark.\n6. Extracellular and intercellular measurements for stimulated 3T3-L1 cells\nAfter the cells have been stimulated for 40 min, transfer the stimulation media from both the plates into new 96-well plates maintaining the same experimental layout.\nDecant any remaining solution from the original stimulated 96-well plates with cells on sterile paper towels.\nOptionally, wash cells with PBS. Remove PBS and decant any remaining solution on sterile paper towels.\nAdd 100 μL of the RIPA lysis buffer to each well. Optionally, add protease inhibitor to the RIPA buffer to protect proteins. Place plates containing RIPA in a shaker for 30 min.\nUsing a microplate reader (Table of Materials), measure fluorescence at excitation (Ex) and emission (Em) wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, first in the medium containing extracellular FD-glucose, and then, the plate with RIPA-lysed cells at the end of 30 min incubation (see step 6.4).\n7. Protein-based normalization of intracellular glucose uptake\nNOTE: Intracellular FD-glucose uptake depends on the cell number. Protein levels in cellular lysates are proportional to the cell numbers that allow normalizing intracellular FD-glucose levels to the number of cells in each well.",
    "Perform BCA protein assay according to manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials). Quantify the protein concentrations in each well containing RIPA-lysed cells.\nUse 10 μL of the RIPA homogenate and measure protein concentrations in triplicate to increase the accuracy of measurements in 96-well plates.\nQuantify protein based on protein standards (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 μg/mL protein) analyzed together with samples on each 96-well plate.\nMeasure the absorbance at 562 nm and quantify protein concentrations in each sample based on the linear regression formula obtained for the protein standard.\nNormalize the levels of intracellular FD-glucose by using fluorescent value/protein concentration in each well. Extracellular FD-glucose depletion does not require normalization.\nOptionally, use the average baseline values in control samples for additional normalization (100%).\n8. Ex vivo measurement of extracellular FD glucose depletion in organs\nPretreat mice with compounds stimulating glucose metabolism before the organ dissection, as follows.\nUse nine-week-old Lepob male mice (n = 11). Feed all mice with a regular chow diet before the experiment.\nAssign mice randomly into three groups for intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections.\n\t\nInject mice from the control Lepob group with 0.1 mL of sterile PBS (n = 4).\nInject mice from the insulin Lepob group with 0.1 mL of sterile PBS, containing 12 IU human insulin per gram of body weight (BW) (n= 3).\nInject mice from the AAC2 Lepob group with 0.1 mL of sterile PBS, containing 0.1 nmol AAC2 per gram of body weight (BW) (n = 4).\nAfter 15 min, subject mice to inhalation of 5% isoflurane and exsanguinate blood by cardiac puncture from the anesthetized animals26.\nDissect visceral epidydimal white adipose tissue (200 mg), liver (200 mg), and whole-brain from each animal. Use a Class II biosafety hood for tissue handling.",
    "Prepare FD-glucose (0.29 mM) working solution in glucose-free DMEM in a Class II Biosafety cabinet without light.\nMeasure the fluorescence of FD-glucose working solution (0.29 mM) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, using a microplate reader.\nIncubate the harvested tissues/organs in a 6-well plate containing PBS for 1 min. Handle each tissue or organ in a separate well.\nAfter 1 min, place each tissue on a sterile paper towel to absorb PBS. Transfer tissues/organs into a separate 6-well plate containing 4,000 µL of glucose-free DMEM and incubate for 2 min.\nAfter 2 min, remove and transfer the tissues into wells of a 6-well plate containing 0.29 mM FD-glucose working solution (1 mL/well). Incubate the 6-well plates containing tissues in FD-glucose working solution at 37 °C (5% CO2 and 95% humidity).\nCollect 100 µL of FD-glucose working solution from each well after 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min of incubation, to analyze the kinetics of extracellular FD glucose depletion. Shake before and after collection.\nTransfer 100 µL of FD-glucose working solution into 96-well plates to measure the fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively, using a microplate reader.\nNormalize fluorescence to the 0 min value (100%) for each organ in each animal (Figure 3).\nSubscription Required.
