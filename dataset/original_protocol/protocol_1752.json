Et(Gal4-VP16)zc1044a;Tg(UAS-E1b:nfsB-mCherry)c264 (MAGENTA), Tg(UAS-1b:Lifeact-EGFP)utm1 (GREEN).\nCritical: The metronidazole (MTZ) induced cell loss assay is always done for 5 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The key difference between early time point (5 h) and recovery time point (18 h) is that in the latter, MTZ is removed and larvae are allowed to recuperate for 18 h after the initial 5 h induction of epithelial cell loss.\nCritical: If experimental design aims to assay both the initial timepoint after cell loss and the compensatory proliferation observed after damage, all treatment groups during the 5 h damage assay should be doubled.\nNote: If screening compounds for enhancement of epithelial restoration additional treatment groups (with/without chemical and with/without induced damage) must be included. In (Wurster et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), we used human recombinant EGF and EPGN at 250 nM during the induction of damage.\nAddition of metronidazole.\nRemove as much media as possible and replace with 2 mL of E3 media.\nAdd 20 μL of 1 M metronidazole for a final concentration of 10 μM.\nPlace all samples at 28.5°C for 5 h.\nScreening compounds for enhancement of epithelial restoration and function",
    "Prepare additional treatment groups to include chemical compounds to be screened and their corresponding controls.\nNote: When screening chemical compounds, a working concentration should be established, usually within the 1–10 μM range and should be adjusted according to observed tolerance/toxicity.\nRemoving MTZ and chemical compounds.\nRemove E3-MTZ and replace it with 2 mL fresh E3 with no MTZ.\nReplace E3 with fresh E3 two more times with no incubation.\nProceed to either Determining the amount of extrusion-induced tissue area loss in the tail fin epithelium (steps 6–8) or detection and visualization of cell loss-induced proliferation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4] sections of the protocol (steps 12–16).\nDetermining the amount of extrusion-induced tissue area loss in the tail fin epithelium\nTiming: 2 days\nThe extent of epithelia area loss caused from MTZ treatment and induced extrusion will vary between individual Et(Gal4-VP16)zc1044a;Tg(UAS-E1b:nfsB-mCherry)c264 larvae, therefore methods for determining the extent of cell loss and tissue area reduction between different treatment groups are required. This section of the protocol provides the methodology necessary for measuring the total area of the tail fin in treated larvae, and provides a quick and efficient method for determining the overall extent of tissue area loss (or protection from cell loss and epithelial damage) between a control and experimental group (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1341-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Fix larvae for the early damage assay by placing in a 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and rock on a three dimensional gentle mixer (referred to as a nutator) overnight at 4°C.\nSample preparation for imaging.\nAfter overnight fixation, remove the PFA solution and rinse samples twice with 750 μL PBS-Triton X-100 (0.1%) with no incubation.\nWash samples with 750 μL PBS-Triton X-100 (0.5%) and rock on mixer for 5 min at room temperature.\nRepeat the wash step two additional times.\nPrepare a DAPI solution by adding DAPI to PBS-Triton X-100 (0.5%) at 1:1000.\nAdd 750 μL of PBS-Triton X-100 with 1:1000 DAPI to samples and rock on mixer for 30 min at room temperature.\nWash samples three times with PBS-Triton X-100 (0.5%) and rock on mixer for five min each at room temperature.\nWash samples one time with 750 μL PBS-Triton X-100 (0.1%) and rock on mixer for 5 min at room temperature\nRinse samples with PBS and mix by inverting tube by hand two to three times\nMount larvae microscope slides and seal with clear nail polish\nAlternatives: A coverslip sealant such as CoverGrip can also be used to seal the microscope slides.\nImaging and quantification of damage to zebrafish epithelia (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1341-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

To ensure uniform measurements between samples, always draw the vertical line distal of the notochord.\nComplete the polygon by tracing the distal edge of the caudal fin from the basal end of the notochord until reaching the dorsal edge where the line was started.\nUse the measuring tool in Fiji to calculate the area included in the polygon.\nDivide resulting data into categories based on area thresholds.\nCritical: In order to accurately measure the fin area, both dorsal and ventral edges of the fin must be captured in the imaging of the tail fin. We find that a 10× image is sufficient for quantification but a 10× with some amount of digital zoom (0.6×) provides a more accurate measurement.\nOptional: This approach can also be expanded to include larger regions of the fin, as long as a standardized methodology is uniformly applied.\nNote: The semi-automated analysis described here can be scaled up and applied to automated image acquisition and screening platforms, such as the Vertebrate Automated Screening Technology (VAST) (Chang et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Jarque et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nDetermining the molecular signals induced by cell loss in the tail fin epithelium\nTiming: 4 days",
    "MTZ treatment of the Et(Gal4-VP16)zc1044a;Tg(UAS-E1b:nfsB-mCherry)c264 transgenic line results in extensive gene expression changes to promote epithelial tissue repair and regeneration. This section of the protocol describes a modified fixation protocol for downstream use with custom in situ probes from Molecular Instruments to detect changes in mRNA of desired target genes using hybridization chain reaction (HCR) (Choi et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nLarvae fixation\nFix larvae after 5 h MTZ exposure by placing in a 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and rock on a nutator overnight at 4°C.\nWash larvae twice (5 min each) with 750 μL PBS.\nWash larvae twice (5 min each) with 750 μL PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-Tween).\nPostfix for 20 min with freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde solution and rock at room temp.\nBriefly wash larvae twice with 750 μL PBS-Tween.\nWash larvae twice (5 min each) with 750 μL PBS-Tween.\nTransfer 10–12 larvae into new Eppendorf tube\nAll subsequent steps can be done in 1.7 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nCritical: Our method omits all steps using methanol (dehydration/rehydration) and the proteinase K digestion step from the manufacturer’s fixation protocol. This reduces the amount of time between the fixation and the actual in situ detection steps. We find that omitting these steps produces reliable results while preserving the tissue morphology of the tail epithelium.\nmRNA detection by in situ hybridization\nFollow protocol Multiplexed HCR v3.0 Protocol from Molecular Instruments.\nNote: This protocol was used with a HCR V3 custom probe set for epigen in zebrafish larvae, XM_001344355.8.\nVisualization of changes in gene expression within the epithelial cells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1341-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

To achieve this and to ensure that tissue morphology is maintained, samples can be mounted on MatTek dishes (Nunc Brand dishes can be used as an alternative to MatTek) using low melt agarose and imaged using any confocal microscope. For our studies, we used a Zeiss LSM-800 confocal microscope and imaged at both 10× and 20×.\nNote: This fixation and in situ detection method can also be applied to identify changes in mRNA expression during the 18 hours after the MTZ recovery step.\nAlternatives: This protocol can be modified to accommodate large-scale in situ screens by using an automated liquid handler such as the Intavis InsituPro VSi (Bioanalytical instruments).\nDetection and visualization of cell loss-induced proliferation\nTiming: 4–5 days\nAcute treatment of Et(Gal4-VP16)zc1044a;Tg(UAS-E1b:nfsB-mCherry)c264 larvae with MTZ results in extensive cell loss and epithelial tissue damage. For this assay, we remove the MTZ and provide an 18 h recovery period to allow for the generation of new cells to replace the lost cells and restore tissue form and function. One of the hallmarks of tissue repair after damage is the induction of cell division aimed at restoring overall cell numbers (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). This section of the protocol describes the framework for detecting dividing cells during tissue recovery and provides a method for quickly quantifying cell division in different treatment groups.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1341-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "Note: Additional nucleotide analogs such as EdU, CldU or IdU can be used as an alternative to BrdU or in conjunction with BrdU in studies requiring multiple rounds of labeling of dividing cells (Bayramli et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Tuttle et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Briefly, BrdU can be administered at the 18 hour recovery time point to label dividing cells. At this point, the larvae can be allowed to recover and be treated with a different nucleotide analog such as CldU or IdU 24 hours later. Subsequent detection of CldU or IdU with BrdU can distinguish cells that divided at one of the two time points (either BrdU positive or CldU/IdU positive) or cells that divided during both time points (cells that are both BrdU and CldU/IdU positive).\nNote: Cell division can also be determined by using antibodies to detect the phosphorylation states of key proteins such as Histone H3. One drawback of this approach is that because H3 phosphorylation is transient the result is that many fewer cells are labeled when compared to nucleotide analogs that are incorporated during S phase such as BrdU."
