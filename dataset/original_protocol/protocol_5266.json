    "Notes:    To enhance detection sensitivity, we disassembled the Halcyon pneumotach and increased the number of metal filters from 4 to 7 in both channels of the pneumotach individually connected to animal and reference chambers (Figures 2A and 2B). By doing so, we increased the differential pressure change caused by subtle neonatal respiration. However, this modification also changed the values of some respiratory parameters (Figure 6). Although we contacted Buxco technical services before and after solving the sensitivity problem, we were unable to get any help to properly adjust the instrument settings to maintain the original values.    The aforementioned change increases the detection sensitivity and also the background signal from the Buxco bias flow pump that is usually used with the plethysmograph, so the bias flow supply has to be removed to reduce the noise from the air supply.   We connected a bended extension tube to the Halcyon pneumotach to avoid any disturbed airflow from the upper environment such as the user’s breath (Figure 2C).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170613/20170613224137_2011.jpg Figure 2.

The modified pneumotach assembled onto the recording chamber was connected with an extension tube (arrow) facing downward to avoid any airflow disturbance.      Transfer the P0 C57BL/6 litter to an ICR foster dam for care until recording.    Incubate a cup of water in an oven at 34 ± 1 °C for humidification. Retrieve all P1 pups and keep them warm in the humidified oven for at least 20 min before plethysmographic recording.   Calibrate the device by following the instructions in the FinePointe wizard (Figure 3).   Click the calibrate icon (Figure 3A).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170613/20170613224425_9611.jpg Figure 3. Calibration of the chamber. A-H.",
    "Follow the instructions in the FinePointe wizard, including zeroing the amplifier, balancing the transducer and injecting air into the chamber.    Click the wrench icon to calibrate each chamber (Figure 3B).   Set the gain level to 3.5 (Figure 3C).   Switch the amplifier to the direct current position (DC).   Turn the balance screw until the chart reads 0 volt (Figures 3D and 3E).   Inject 200 μl air into the chamber (Figure 3F).   Ensure the injected airflow is completely contained within the highlighted purple region and that the red cursor is on 0 (Figure 3G).   Switch the amplifier to the alternating current position (AC) position and push the ‘next’ button for re-zeroing.   Click the ‘finish’ button to complete the calibration (Figure 3H).     Place a P1 pup in the animal chamber gently.   Close the chamber and let the pup habituate for 1 min.    Start the measurement. Record each pup for three 3-min sessions. To avoid the accumulation of CO2 and humidity in the absence of bias flow air supply, open the chamber at the end of each session for 1 min.    Remove the pup from the animal chamber.   Save the recording traces (Figure 4) and proceed to data analysis (Figure 5).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170613/20170613224648_9109.jpg Figure 4.
