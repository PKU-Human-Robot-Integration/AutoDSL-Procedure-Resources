Detailed method for perfusion, vessel casting, tissue harvesting and fixation\n(A) Overview of the perfusion table for vessel casting.\n(B) Surgical instruments used for perfusion.\n(C)Peristaltic pump used for perfusion and vessel casting.\n(D) Shaker.\n(E) Preparation of a box fulfilled with ice.\n(F–H) (F) Restrict the mouse on the table by use of the needles, exposing the chest cavity, and starting perfusion with 1×PBS through the left ventricle followed by vessel casting. The mouse body after vessel casting was quickly transferred to the ice box (G) and submerged into the ice (H).\n(I) Harvested tissues were then post-fixed by 4% PFA in 4°C.\nWarm the 0.01 M PBS to 40°C using a water bath. Turn on the pump and drain the air with warm PBS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: Before perfusion, ensure that the pump pipe used for perfusion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) is filled with warm PBS. Existence of air will lead to insufficient perfusion, resulting in potential damage to the vascular structures.\nDeeply anesthetize the mice with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (100/20 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Then transcardially perfuse the mice with 0.01 M PBS to wash out the blood.\nNote: It is observed that the liver turns white, and the right atrial appendage flows clear PBS, indicating that the blood is sufficiently washed out.",
    "Critical: There may be a little difference in labeling the lung vasculature. The users should insert the perfusion needles into the right ventricle and cut the left atrial appendage to ensure that the dye solution go through the pulmonary circulation.\nTurn off the perfusion pump, change PBS into the prepared lipophilic dye solutions. Perfuse 10–15 mL of the dye solution into the mouse body under warm conditions, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F.\nCritical: During perfusion, the entire mouse body will experience continuous convulsions, which indicates that the labeling works well. If there is no convulsion happened, or the mouse lungs are swelling along with water outflowing the nasal cavity of mouse, it indicates that the vessel labeling is largely failed. This is probably because the syringe needle is inserting too deep into the right ventricle. In this case, gently move the needle outward without dropping out of the heart. If there is a general convulsion happened soon afterwards, the vessel casting can be continued and completed. Or the vessel casting is failed and should be repeated on another mouse.\nNote: The volume of dye solution for mice is largely depend on how the perfusion performs. If the perfusion is good, 10 mL dye solution is enough. If the perfusion is not very good (but not failed), more dye solution will be needed (15 mL).\nNote: The two concentrations are designed for different organ types. Lower concentration (2%) is suitable for organs with large cavity, such as heart. And higher concentration (4%) is suitable for other organs.\nStop the perfusion, pull out the needle, and turn off the pump. Quickly transfer the perfused mouse into ice box for rapid cooling, as shown in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G and 2H.",
    "Note: After 1–2 h cooling in the ice box, transfer the mouse body to the 4°C refrigerator overnight.\nAfter sufficient cooling, collect the desired mouse organs and tissues carefully from the mouse body.\nCritical: Cooling of the mouse body is important for the dye solution to form stable hydrogels within the blood vessels, therefore, successful execution of this step is very critical for the final labeling performance of vascular networks.\nNote: Because the tissue is not fixed by 4% PFA, it is relatively soft and fragile during tissue harvesting. Therefore, operation of tissue extraction should be careful and gentle. The harvest mouse tissues/organs are put into a 50 mL tube containing 4% PFA, and store it in a 4°C refrigerator overnight for post fixation, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I.\nNote: Do not put too many tissue samples in one tube for post fixation, which may affect tissue morphology. Add enough 4% PFA to fully immerse the tissue for good fixation. The volume ratio of the sample and the 4% PFA solution should be larger than 1:10.\n2D and 3D immunolabeling of VALID-casted samples (optional)\nTiming: 1–5 d\nIn some cases, simultaneous investigation of other cell types with vascular networks assisted by immunolabeling is needed, such as parvalbumin (PV), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), NeuN, Ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). VALID protocol has been proved to be compatible with immunolabeling. This step describes the detailed procedure for how to perform 2D and 3D immunolabeling on VALID-casted samples.\nTissue embedding and sectioning.\nWash the fixed samples with 0.01 M PBS with gently shaking, refresh the PBS every 1 h for at least three times to wash out the residual PFA.",
    "Add agarose powder in pure water at the concentration of 4%. Heating the turbid liquid with a microwave oven until the powder is fully dissolved.\nCool the agarose solution and immerse the desired samples into the solution until solidification of agarose.\nSlice the embedded samples into tissue sections with desired thickness using a commercial vibratome.\n2D immunolabeling for VALID-casted samples.\nBlocking. Fully immerse the thin tissue sections in the blocking solution for 3–6 h with gently shaking at 37°C.\nPrimary antibody labeling. Transfer the tissue sections into the primary antibody solution (1:500 diluted in the antibody diluent buffer) for 0.5–1 d with gently shaking at 37°C. Make sure that the samples are fully immersed.\nWash the samples with PBST solution for at least 6 times (20 min/ per time) to remove the residual primary antibodies.\nSecondary antibody labeling. Transfer the tissue sections into the secondary antibody solution (1:500 diluted in the antibody diluent buffer) for 0.5–1 d with gently shaking. Make sure that the samples are fully immersed.\nNote: The concentration of primary and secondary antibodies can be varied depending on the user guide from different manufacturer.\nWash the samples with PBST solution for 6 times (20 min/ per time) to remove the residual primary antibodies.\nNote: All steps are carried out at room temperature. Protect the samples from light during the entire procedure. The immunolabeled samples are stored in PBS at 4°C before imaging\n3D immunolabeling for VALID-casted samples.\nSample pre-treatment. Treat the samples with a sequence of methanol solution: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, 80%, 60%, 40% and 20%, 1 h for each step with gently shaking, then washed with PBST for 1 h.",
    "Tissue permeabilization and blocking. Incubate the pre-treated samples in permeabilization solution at 37°C overnight, then transfer the samples to the blocking solution at 37°C for 1 d. Wash the samples by PTwH overnight. Refresh the PTwH solutions for at least 6 times.\nPrimary antibody labeling. Incubate the treated samples in the primary antibody dilution at 37°C with gentle shaking for 2–3 d. Wash the samples for 1 d with PTwH. Refresh the PTwH solutions for at least 6 times.\nSecondary antibody labeling. Incubate the samples in the secondary antibody dilution at 37°C with gentle shaking for 2–3 d.\nWash the tissues in PTwH for 1 d. Refresh the PTwH solutions for at least 6 times.\nNote: It should be noticed that if 3D immunolabeling needs to be performed, the step 8 should be skipped and the step 7 is optional (Sometimes thick tissue slices are also used for 3D immunolabeling). During the entire 3D immunolabeling process, sodium azide must be added to all used solutions to prevent the sample from decaying. All steps are performed with gently shaking.\nPause point: The immunolabeled tissues can be stored at this time in PBST/PTWH for one week before clearing and imaging. The immunolabeled samples should be stored at 4°C until use.\nTissue clearing for VALID-casted samples\nTiming: 1–4 d\nThe VALID-casted samples with/without immunolabeling should be cleared before 3D imaging by optical tomography. This step will provide sufficient details on how to perform tissue clearing for VALID-casted samples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2905-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Examples for tissue clearing using two different types of clearing method\n(A) Tissue clearing with a solvent-based clearing method, using THF for dehydration and DBE for RI matching.\n(B) Tissue clearing with an aqueous-based clearing method, MACS.\nSolvent-based tissue clearing,6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.",
    "Preparation of gradient dehydration solutions. Use distilled water to prepare gradient methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution at concentrations of 50%, 70%, 80%, 100%, 100%. Prepare the Tert-butanol (TB) solution at concentrations of 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 100%.\nDehydrate the prepared samples using the certain gradient solutions described above. For example, dehydrate the samples by THF solutions at concentration gradients of 50%, 70%, 80%, 100%, 100%. The time for each dehydration step is 4 h (tissue slices)/12 h (whole organs).\nNote: All the steps are performed with gently shaking. The volume ratio of the sample and the 4% PFA solution should be larger than 1:10.\nNote: Here we provide four dehydration reagents in this step, users may only choose one for their own research. In our experience, we recommend THF for dehydration due to its relative high efficiency and robustness.\nTransfer the dehydrated samples to pure dibenzyl ether (DBE) for refractive index matching until the samples become fully transparent.\nNote: When clearing hard bones, the samples should be firstly decalcified by 20% EDTA solution for 1–2 d, the decalcified bones are then processed with tissue clearing procedure. The signals of vasculature labeled by VALID are usually very bright, the autofluorescence of samples can be ignored in most instances. If the autofluorescence within samples is very strong, such as muscle samples, it may be effective by bleaching the samples in 1%–2% H2O2 for 30 min to reduce autofluorescence.\nAqueous-based tissue clearing (MACS),9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nPreparation of MACS solution. MACS-R0 contains 20 vol% MXDA and 15% (w/v) sorbitol mixed with distilled water, MACS-R1 contains 40 vol% MXDA and 30% (w/v) sorbitol dissolved in 1 × PBS. MACS-R2 contains a mixture of 40 vol% MXDA and 50% (w/v) sorbitol in distilled water.",
    "Note: Proper heating with a water bath could promote the dissolution of sorbitol.\nMACS clearing. Incubate the prepared samples in 20–30 mL MACS-R0, MACS-R1, and MACS-R2 solutions in 50 mL conical tubes with gentle shaking at room temperature.\nNote: The time needed for each step depends on tissue size. We use 1 h, 1 h, 0.5 h for tissue slices and 1.5 d, 0.5 d, 0.5 d for whole organs. The volume ratio of the sample and the 4% PFA solution should be larger than 1:10.\nNote: Users can refer to the original publications of MACS method for further details. Additionally, other aqueous-based clearing methods like Ce3D10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] and ScaleS,11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] which are detergent-free, could also be employed. Note that VALID is not compatible with aqueous-based clearing methods involving large concentration detergents.\n3D imaging and analysis of the vascular networks\nTiming: 1–6 h\nThis step will describe the procedure for fluorescence imaging with confocal or light sheet microscope, as well as the detailed pipeline for 3D analysis of vascular structures via Imaris software.\nFluorescence imaging.\nConfocal imaging. Use a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM710, Zeiss, Germany) for imaging tissue slices.\nNote: LSM 710 is equipped with a 5× objective lens (FLUAR, NA = 0.25, WD = 12.5 mm) and a 10× objective lens (FLUAR, NA = 0.5, WD = 2 mm). The Zen 2011 SP2 software (Version 8.0.0.273, Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany) is used to collect data.\nLight sheet imaging. Image the cleared samples (e.g., brain, spinal cord, kidney, liver, etc.) with a light sheet microscope (LiTone XL, Light Innovation Technology, China) equipped with a 4× objective lens (NA = 0.28, working distance (WD) = 20 mm).\nNote: The detailed information of light sheet microscope used in this study is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].",
    "Note: In this step, we just provide the basic information of fluorescence imaging systems used in this study for reference. Users are able to employ different imaging systems in their lab to image the fluorescent-labeled vasculature.\nImaris-based 3D visualization and analysis of vascular networks, as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2905-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Setup for light sheet imaging\n(A) Overview of the LiTone XL light sheet microscope.\n(B and C) Direct view of the imaging module with (B) and without (C) head cover.\n(D) Magnified view of the imaging room.\n(E) The sample chamber.\n(F) The sample holder.\n(G) Example images for cleared samples mounting in the sample holder.\n(H) Interface for the acquisition software for the light sheet system.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2905-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Visualization and quantification of blood vessels using Imaris\n(A) Pipeline for analyzing vascular structures with Filament module in Imaris.\n(B) Visualization and rendering of vascular imaging datasets of mouse cerebral cortex by Filaments module.\n(C) Quantitative analysis of vascular structures within mouse brain and spinal cord (n = 3). All values are presented as the mean ± SD.\nConvert acquired imaging data files (.tif, .czi) to Imaris™ file (.ims) format by dragging and dropping the files into ‘Imaris™ File Converter’, or directly import the .tif files into Imaris and save as .ims file.\nOpen the vascular data files in 3D view within Imaris, set the image properties based on the parameters of imported image data (e.g., resolution for X, Y, Z axis). Rotate the 3D image in the navigate function, obtain the snapshot image by clicking the ‘snapshot’ button at desired resolution.\nUse the ‘filament’ function to perform quantitative analysis of the vascular networks.\nAdd a ‘filament’ to the current opened dataset, the software will direct you to choose different algorithms and parameters to conduct the analysis.",
    "We use the “Threshold (loops)” algorithm in filaments module to trace and quantify blood vessels.\nThe parameter for filaments diameter is automatically set by the algorithm according to the voxel size. The voxel size of our data is 0.83 μm × 0.83 μm×2 μm. Threshold for extracting vascular information was manually adjusted to ensure the complete recognition of all blood vessels.\nAfter reconstruction of the vascular network, obtain the local vessel density, average radius, and the vessel segment length using the “statistics-selection” in filaments module. Export the desired datasets as excel files.\nNote: Optionally, users can also choose the ‘autopath (no loops)’ algorithm in filaments module to trace and quantify blood vessels. In this case, users can choose tracing method including ‘auto network’, ‘auto path’ and ‘manual’. And we prefer the ‘auto network’ because it is the easiest. However, if the data quality is not very high, the ‘manual’ could be selected to avoid too much error tracing.\nNote: Recently, a novel open-source software, called VesselExpress, was published in Cell Reports Methods that enabled efficient analysis of vessel trees in 3D data of various organs.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] This software can provide more comprehensive analysis of vascular networks than Imaris. It may become a powerful alternative to analyze different vascular networks in 3D."
