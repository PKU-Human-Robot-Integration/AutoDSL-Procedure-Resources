    "1. Dissection and Recording Electrical Activity from the Propodite-dactylopodite (PD) Nerve\nHold the crab across the carapace from behind, and avoiding the claws, pinch the proximal part of the meropodite with forceps. The leg will autotomize to prevent the animal from bleeding to death. Use caution when handling blue crabs as they are rather aggressive and very fast.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. First walking leg of a crab. The anatomical location of chordotonal organs (hatched regions) are superimposed on this schematic. The double arrow head indicates where to transect the leg for the PD nerve experiments.

Discard the carpopodite and the attached meropodite (Figure 1).\nCut a large window in the cuticle on the pigmented (lateral) side of the propodite with a scalpel with a #11 blade (Figure 2 and 3). Note: Do not cut deeply.\nRemove the cuticle layer by sliding the scalpel blade beneath and parallel to the cuticle. This severs the muscle fibers attached to the cuticle.\nUsing the same technique cut a smaller window on the pigmentless (medial) side of the propodite, but leave the condyle (the socket joint or hinge between segments) attachment intact.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Note: See Table 1 for species specific saline recipes.\nLocate the PD organ by carefully probing with the fire-polished glass needles. The elastic strand spanning the joint has a silver appearance.",
    "Remove muscle fibers that obscure your view of the organ from both sides of the tendon. Be very careful not to injure the PD organ or its nerve.\nOnce this has been accomplished, firmly reattach the preparation to the dish with the pigment side (lateral) facing up (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Exposed PD organ and nerve. Click here to view larger image[href=http://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig4highres.jpg].\nFollow the PD organ nerve in the propodite as far proximally as possible in order to free-up a long length of nerve (1.5 cm) for recording purposes. This is best done while the PD nerve is still attached to the main leg nerve.\nAfter separating the PD nerve from the main leg nerve with the aid of glass needles, sever the PD nerve proximally with the iris scissors. Note: Do not stretch or pull on the nerve during the dissection.\nMove the dactylopodite to an extended and fully flexed position. Take note about where the extreme flexion and extension positions are and a half-way point for later use.\nPlace a ground wire inside the saline bath.\nTurn on the electrophysiology recording hardware/software. Note: Our setup has been described previously23.\nPosition the microscope so that it is overlooking the microscope stage. Once the prep dish is placed on the stage, you will need to adjust the position of the high intensity illuminator beam to best visualize the preparation.\nPosition the micromanipulator so the attached suction electrode assembly will have easy access to the saline bath and preparation. The suction electrode is constructed as shown in an online video24.\nTo detect neural activity, draw the cut end of the PD nerve into the suction electrode.\nMove the dactyl throughout extended and flexed positions for several cycles with the aid of a glass probe or wooden dowel.",
    "Next observe activity when the dactyl is pinned in the extended, flexed, and mid positions.\n2. Recording Electrical Activity from the Tension Nerve while Monitoring Force Generation\nDetermine the lateral and medial side of the leg. The medial side has a soft texture that can be felt by pinching gently in the meropodite region with a fingernail.\nPlace this soft cuticle side up in the dish. The excitor motor nerve that innervates the opener muscle also innervates the stretcher muscle in the carpopodite.\nIn order to stimulate the opener muscle the stretcher motor nerve in the carpodite region is isolated and stimulated with a suction electrode. The proximal part of the leg is removed by transecting the meropodite with scissors.\nRemove a section of the cuticle in the carpus region on the inner side (medial side, Figure 5A).\nCut the apodeme of the bender muscle and remove the muscle carefully as not to pull the main leg nerve out of the leg cavity (Figure 5B, C note the arrows where to bender apodeme is separated). The main leg nerve and a branch to the stretcher muscle can then be observed (Figure 5D).\nFind the nerve branching from the main nerve bundle to the stretcher muscle (Figure 5E, at arrow). This can be cut close to the muscle and pulled into a suction electrode to stimulate (Figures 5F and G, arrow depicts the branch).\nTease out a section of the nerve that projects towards the opener without pinching the nerve. Transect the stretcher/opener motor nerve.\nPull the motor nerve into the suction electrode and then stimulate it.",
    "To expose the opener muscle and tension nerve remove the closer muscle and the ventral region of the propodite. Cut off the closer muscle with a scalpel with a #11 blade in the propodite (Figure 6). Note: Do not cut deeply in the proximal region because it might damage the opener motor nerve.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Cut the cuticle on the ventral half of the propodite to expose the closer muscle so it can be removed. Click here to view larger image[href=http://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig6highres.jpg].\nExchange the saline with fresh cooled saline throughout the dissection process to keep the neurons alive. For further dissection, place the preparation dish under a dissecting microscope and use fiber-optic illumination.\nCarefully cut the closer tendon from its attachment to the dactyl using sharp-pointed medium-size scissors.\nBe very careful not to disturb the branches to the opener muscle from the main leg nerve which should be clearly visible.\nRemove and discard the closer muscle and tendon.\nMake a hole in the dactyl with a dissection pin. This hole will be used later to hook the metal pin on the tension (force) transducer, but it is necessary to make it at this stage of the procedure.\nLocate the nerve branch that projects to the opener muscle and apodeme in the distal region of the opener muscle. Carefully probe the nerve with the fire-polished glass tool.\nObserve the tension nerve that arises from the distal end of the apodeme and proceeds to the motor nerve bundle.",
    "To detect neural activity, fill a suction electrode with crab saline and draw the cut end of the opener tension nerve into the electrode. Ensure that the suction electrode fits tightly on the nerve.\nExamine for the neural correlate of passive tension on the opener apodeme. While recording electrical activity from the tension nerve, rotate the dactyl rapidly into an extended joint (i.e. stretching the opener muscle).\nNext, test active force development in relation to stimulation frequency.\nFirmly attach a metal hook so that the tip of the hook goes through a small hole in the dactyl.\nAttach the other end of the metal hook to the force transducer. Note: Make sure the transducer is at a 90° angle each time so that the pin is perpendicular to the transducer for maximal detection of the force generated.\nPull the hook and dactyl so that it is at about a 45° angle of the opener joint.\nNow stimulate the motor nerve at 100 Hz for 250 msec and measure the force as well as the firing frequency of the tension nerve.\nPlace the joint into a fully extended position so that the opener muscle fibers are flaccid.\nStimulate the motor nerve at 100 Hz for 250 msec and measure the force as well as the firing frequency of the tension nerve.\nBend/flex the joint so that it is fully flexed (~90°). In this position the muscle fibers of the opener are fully stretched. There may be some force measured by the transducer due to this passive stretch of the muscle.\nStimulate the motor nerve at 100 Hz for 250 msec and measure the force as well as the firing frequency of the tension nerve.",
    "After measuring a force, proceed in a series of various frequencies: 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 Hz for 8-10 sec in each joint position.\nMeasure the response with a quick tension release. Arrange the preparation so that the hook on the force transducer can easily be pushed out of the hole in the dactyl.\nBend/flex the joint so that it is fully flexed (~90°). Now stimulate the motor nerve at 100 Hz with a continuous stimulation of 5 sec.\nAfter the first second or less, as tension has built up on the opener muscle, push the pin out of the hole in the dactyl.\nExamine the tension nerve recording before and after release of the pin holding the dactyl.\nModulatory effects of neuroactive substances such as octopamine, serotonin, and proctolin, which alter the output of the tension neurons, can be determined by adding these molecules to the bathing media over the exposed opener muscle and repeating the experiments.\nUse a pipette and drip 1-2 ml over the preparation.\n3. Staining Peripheral Nervous System Structures in Crustacean Walking Legs\nMethylene blue technique\nDilute one part methylene blue chloride stock solution (0.25%) with two parts of distilled water.\nAdd this mixture to five parts of buffered saline. Thoroughly irrigate the area of interest.\nDissect a leg according to the protocol in section 1. Incubate the preparation in the methylene blue solution at 12-13 °C.\nExamine the preparation every 10-15 min with the dissecting microscope using low intensity illumination to follow the progress of the staining. In some cases staining will be completed in an hour, in others it may take overnight.\n4-di-2-ASP technique",
    "Fluorescent dyes can be used to back-fill the PD neuron or directly stain the preparation from the bath. However a suitable microscope with abilities to view the fluorescent stain is required.\nDissect a leg according to a protocol in section 1.\nIncubate the preparation in a 10 µM concentration of 4-Di-2-ASP solution and leave the preparation in the refrigerator for 15 min. Use just enough solution to cover the preparation.\nPhotograph the preparations quickly and avoid over exposure to the mercury light. This fluorescent dye fades away relatively quickly.\nCobalt chloride technique\nExpose the PD nerve according to the protocol in section 1 and keep it immersed in cold saline.\nMake a petroleum jelly well to hold the CoCl2. If any CoCl2 spills into the saline bath the entire preparation will stain black, and the preparation should be discarded.\nSlip a small cut of a polystyrene sheet, to make a plastic platform, and pin it in such a manner that it will not float away or become immersed in the saline bath (Figure 7).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Polystyrene sheet with pins to hold in place in dish. Click here to view larger image[href=http://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig7highres.jpg].\nEject petroleum jelly from a fine hypodermic needle fastened to a disposable syringe, then make a barrier (a circle might work well), which should be about 1-1.5 mm high except for a shallow \"V\" at midpoint where the nerve will be draped across, on top of the slip of polystyrene.\nMake a small puddle of saline on either side of the barrier near the \"V\". Taking care not to stretch or pinch the nerve, lift the nerve carefully from the dish and place it in the saline puddle in the petroleum jelly well.",
    "Work quickly so that the section of nerve does not dry out, carefully eject petroleum jelly to cover the exposed nerve. Now test the barrier with saline and make sure it is not leaking.\nBlot away saline on the inside of the barrier and see if it fills up when the bath saline is high around the wall of petroleum jelly to be sure that the two sides are isolated from one another (Figure 8).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Petroleum jelly well with saline and PD nerve spanning the well. The PD nerve has not been cut yet.

Avoid letting the paper wrap up the nerve.\nMake a new puddle using a few small drops of distilled water, and then cut the nerve end. Be very careful not to pull the nerve through the barrier when making the cut. The osmotic shock of the distilled water will \"balloon\" the axons.\nWithin 30 sec add a small drop of CoCl2 to the water, soak up this solution, and then add enough CoCl2 to form a puddle over this shortened section of nerve (Figure 9). Preparations are best kept refrigerated at 13 °C for 12-24 hr.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51050/51050fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. The cut PD nerve being exposed to CoCl2. The cut nerve swells up in the presence of water that facilitates and accelerates the movement of dye molecules through the axons into the neuron cell bodies.

Blot away the cobalt solution using a tissue and wash away the remnants of cobalt with several changes of saline.",
    "Transfer the isolated preparation to a small glass Petri dish containing about 10 ml of crab saline. The neurons are washed and the following steps are performed in situ. Good metal tools are not to be used to handle the preparation after this step (you should use specific tools that are not to be used at a later time for physiology).\nAdd 1-2 drops of ammonium sulfide (NH4)2S to the saline. Cap the (NH4)2S bottle tightly and place back into the hood. Observe the reaction in the preparation under a dissecting microscope\nWithin 1-2 min, cobalt-filled neurons and their processes should begin to appear because they will stain black.\nAfter 5-10 min, replace the development solution with fresh saline.\nMake certain that the development solution you have poured into the sink drain is followed by running tap water for a few minutes or in a waste bottle with a lid.\nPour out the saline and fix the nerve preparation for about 15 min with two changes of Bouin’s solution fixative. For larger tissues like the opener muscle (to stain tension neurons), increase the duration of fixation to 30 min.\nDehydrate in a series of ascending order of ethanol concentration beginning at 70% (i.e. 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%). About 10 min at each concentration is sufficient for small tissues.\nAfter about 10-15 min in two changes of 100% ethanol, clear the tissue by replacing ethanol with 100% methyl salicylate. The preparation will stay in this solution permanently for repeated viewing. With time the filled cells will become more apparent because the surrounding tissue will become clearer. Intensification methods can be used to help prevent fading over time25.",
    "Use the same process to fill the tension nerve with CoCl2. However, change ethanol solution multiple times in each ethanol dehydration step and incubate the preparation inside alcohol for about 20 min for each step to thoroughly dehydrate the muscles and allow them to clear well."
