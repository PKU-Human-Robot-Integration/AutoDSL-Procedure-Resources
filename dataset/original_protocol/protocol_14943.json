    "1. Setup of Sterile Field\nDon proper attire including cap and mask. Wear eye protection when in the processing room.\nPrepare the processing area. When using a processing room, maintain continuous operation of the fan to create positive pressure in the room.\nGather all supplies. Check expiration dates, package integrity, and sterilization indicator.\nWash hands and don non-sterile gloves.\nOpen the sterile kits to establish a sterile field. When using a processing room, place the kits on the table and aseptically open the wraps. Do not utilize the outer 1½ inches of the wrap as part of the sterile field as this segment is considered unsterile.\nUsing aseptic technique, open and drop sterile items onto sterile field unless already part of the premade pack.\nMove microscope so that it is above the sterile field, turn on light source of microscope, and adjust oculars as necessary.\nObtain corneal tissue to be stripped (in preservation media) and place next to the prepared sterile processing area. Loosen cap of viewing chamber and let it rest on top of viewing chamber base with no threads engaged. Discard non-sterile gloves.\nOpen one pair of sterile gloves and sterile gown with towel.\nPerform surgical scrub. Put on sterile gown, then sterile gloves.\nOpen instrument boxes so that all supplies are accessible. Open moisture impermeable drape to create the work area.\nAttach needle to a 5 cc syringe. Using a hemostat, prepare the 30 G needle by placing a bend 1 mm from the bevel, and another bend 1 mm from the base (to form an “S” shape).\nAssemble the glass syringe for the trypan blue stain by placing the plunger into the syringe and finger tightening the plunger. Attach cannula.\nAttach the cannula to the balanced salt solution (BSS) bottle.",
    "Separate the trephine punch from the vacuum block and set aside. Center the vacuum block within the field of view of the microscope.\nBring the vacuum block into focus by adjusting the microscope settings.\n2. Procedure for Donor Tissue Preparation\nLift lid of viewing chamber using foil square as a barrier. With opposite hand and using forceps, gently grasp cornea by sclera rim to remove cornea. Replace lid of viewing chamber.\nCompletely depress the suction syringe, then place cornea epithelial side down on the vacuum block and ensure that it is centered. (Figure 1)\nGently lower seating ring on to the vacuum block using the guide posts. Engage vacuum by slowly releasing piston of the suction syringe. Remove the seating ring and set aside. (Figure 2).\nPerform a partial trephination to score through the Descemet’s membrane.\nAdjust microscope zoom and focus so that the tissue is well visualized.\nTilt the vacuum block and use a sterile swab spear placed at the limbus to remove excess medium. (Figure 3)\nPlace enough stain at the limbus to stain the edge of the scored Descemet’s membrane. Allow the stain to remain on the endothelium for 60-90 sec. (Figure 4)\nRemove stain:\n\t\nTilt the vacuum block to pour the stain off of the cornea and onto gauze pad.\nUse the surgical spears to remove excess stain from the limbal area of the cornea, taking care not to touch the endothelium. (Figure 5)\nUse several drops of BSS to rinse the cornea of staining solution, and sterile swab spears to remove excess BSS. (Figure 6)\nPlace 1-2 drops of BSS on the sclera rim to prevent tissue from drying. Repeat as necessary throughout the procedure.\nPerform partial dissection of Descemet’s membrane:",
    "Beginning where the tubing connects to the vacuum block, using open forceps, place one tip at the edge of the score mark and gently separate Descemet’s membrane and endothelium away from the stroma. (Figure 7).\nSeparate Descemet’s membrane and endothelium not more than 1 mm from the scored edge and continue dissection 360° around. (Figure 8).\nNote location of any micro tears by placing a dot on the vacuum block with the skin marker.\n\t\tNOTE: If the trephine did not penetrate completely through Descemet’s membrane, use the beveled edge of the prepared 30 G needle to complete the score through Descemet’s membrane where necessary, followed by a second application of staining as needed. If Descemet’s membrane’s adhesiveness is impeding the partial dissection, remove the endothelium outside the trephinated area as needed.\nUse forceps to remove any endothelial tags that overlap the score mark.\nConsider the location of previously marked micro tears and rotate the vacuum block so that the largest is at 6 o’clock. This will become the hinge of the flap.\nUsing the forceps, grasp the Descemet’s membrane at 12 o’clock. Gently separate the Descemet’s membrane from the stroma by peeling towards the hinge. Create the hinge by stopping the separation 2 mm from the score mark.\n\tNOTE: Peripheral edges of flap will begin to scroll during separation. (Figure 9).\nGently lay the flap back in place on the stroma. Use BSS and swab spears to unscroll the endothelium and return it to its original position. (Figure 10A-C)\nRemove residual fluid from between Descemet’s membrane and stroma with sterile swab spears so the flap stays in position. (Figure 11)",
    "Use sterile swab spears to soak up any excess moisture from the sclera near the hinge. Use the skin marker to draw an arrowhead on the sclera rim pointing to the center of the hinge, remove any excess ink using a sterile swab spear. (Figure 12)\nRelease vacuum by depressing the piston of the syringe connected to the vacuum block. While vacuum is disengaged, use forceps to remove cornea from the vacuum block.\nLift lid of viewing chamber using foil square as a barrier. Place the cornea in the viewing chamber, endothelial side up, and replace lid of viewing chamber.\nRepeat above procedure steps with mate cornea, if applicable. Use gauze to clean the vacuum block before processing the second tissue.\nTighten the viewing chamber lid(s) and remove tissue from the processing area.\nBreak down the sterile field by disposing of items according to Biohazardous Waste Management Plan. Remove contaminated gloves, and gown. Wash hands and don non-sterile gloves.\nPerform post-cut slit lamp evaluation and specular microscopy of the cornea(s) and record the findings.\nSubscription Required.
