    "All mice were maintained and handled according to the Swiss Animal Welfare Law and in compliance with the regulations of the Cantonal Veterinary office, Zurich.\n1. Preparation of Dissection Material, Culture Media, Microfluidic Devices\nAutoclave micro-dissection forceps and scissors (121 °C, sterilization time: 20 min) and store them in a sterile container.\nSterilize glass coverslips (24 mm x 24 mm) by incubating them in 1 M HCl for 24 hr on an orbital shaker at 37 °C. Wash them three times with sterile, distilled H2O and three times with ethanol 99%. Dry then the coverslips at 37 °C or under sterile flow hood. Finally, autoclave or expose the coverslips to UV light (30 min) to complete the sterilization. Coverslips can then be stored in ethanol 70%.\nRemove carefully the AXIS Axon Isolation Devices from the package using sterile forceps and place them in a sterile Petri dish.\nUsing a sterile biopsy punch (ø: 1mm) create one hole per sample to be cultured (Figure 1) in correspondence of the culture chambers.\n\tNOTE: Do not punch too close to the microgrooves, as they might be damaged by the pressure applied.\nSterilize the AXIS Axon Isolation Devices by immerging them in ethanol 70%. Dry then AXIS Axon Isolation Devices and coverslips completely under a sterile flow hood. Wait a minimum of 3 hr before proceeding.\n\tNOTE: incomplete drying will result in defective assembly of the microfluidic devices.\nPlace each coverslip into a 35 mm Petri dish or into a well within a 6-wells plate.\nPlace the AXIS Axon Isolation Device onto the coverslip and press gently but firmly with a forceps with bent ends in order to allow full adhesion between the isolation device and the glass coverslip.",
    "In each culture chamber, pipette 150 µl of poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml in sterile, distilled H2O). Place the microfluidic devices under vacuum for 5 min, in order to remove all the air from the culture chambers.\nIf air can still be seen within the chambers, re-pipette the poly-D-lysine solution into the chambers.\nIncubate the devices with poly-D-lysine O/N at 37 °C.\nWash chambers three time with sterile, distilled H2O.\nFill chambers with 150 µl laminin working solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 5 µg/ml, in PBS or serum-free medium), and incubate O/N at 37 °C.\nPrepare 50 ml of medium for trigeminal ganglia cultures 37 , composed as follows: 48 ml Neurobasal medium, 1 ml B-27, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF), 0.25 pM cytosine arabinoside.\nPrepare 50 ml of medium for tooth germ cultures 37, composed as follows: 40 ml DMEM-F12, 10 ml foetal bovine serum (FBS, final concentration: 20%), 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 150 µg/ml ascorbic acid.\n2. Mouse Embryo Generation and Dissection\nDetermine embryonic age according to vaginal plug (vaginal plug: embryonic day of development 0.5, E0.5) and confirm it via morphological criteria. For this protocol, we generally use E14.5-E17.5 mouse embryos.\nClean the dissection area and the stereoscope with ethanol 70%.\nSacrifice the pregnant mother via cervical dislocation. Block the neck of the mouse with the first and second finger onto a grid, and pull with decision the tail.\nDissect the skin around the lower abdomen, and open the abdomen using scissors. Locate the uterus: during such late stages of pregnancy, the uterus abundantly fill the abdominal cavity.\nDissect out the uterus and place in a tube filled with PBS on ice. When on ice, the tissue can be left for several hr. Discard the corpse of the mother according to institutional guidelines",
    "Dissect out the embryos from the uterus and free them from their extraembryonic tissues. Place the embryos in PBS on ice.\nDecapitate the embryos using scissors, and separate the lower jaw from the rest of the head using micro-dissection scissors (Figure 2A). Remove precisely the lower jaw, without damaging the trigeminal ganglia; as the latter are localized in close proximity to the lower jaw, their accidental damage is possible. Preserve the lower jaw and the rest of the head in cold PBS, on ice.\nTo dissect TG, take the head and place it onto a dissection glass Petri dish, previously filled with cold PBS. Using the forceps, remove the skin and the skull. Remove then the telencephalon and the cerebellum by placing forceps below the telencephalon and lift; the telencephalon and the cerebellum will flip together, leaving the bottom of the skull exposed.\nLocalize the trigeminal ganglia (shown in Figure 2B). Use the forceps to separate the TG from the trigeminal nerves. Eliminate the remnants of the trigeminal projections using the dissection needles as knifes. Place the dissected TG in a Petri dish filled with cold PBS and keep them on ice.\nTo dissect embryonic teeth, place the lower jaw, previously separated from the skull, onto the dissection glass Petri dish, filled with cold PBS. Using dissection needles as knifes, remove the tongue and the skin surrounding the jaw. Separate the left and the right hemi-jaws by cutting along the midline of the jaw. The tooth germs are easily visible, as shown in Figure 1C. Isolate the tooth germs using dissection needles and remove the excess of non-dental tissues. Place the dissected tooth germs in a Petri dish filled with cold PBS and keep them on ice.\n3. Microfluidic Co-cultures",
    "After dissection, remove laminin from the microfluidic devices. Fill the chambers with 200 µl of the respective media.\nWith forceps, transfer gently the dissected TG and tooth germs into the holes created by punching (Figure 1D). Make sure that the tooth germs do not float and that they sink until they contact the coverslips.\nCulture the samples in incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange the culture medium every 48 hr. Do not empty the chambers completely, and do not pipette directly into the culture chambers. Complete emptying of chambers would result in the formation of air bubbles within the chambers; direct pipetting into the chamber would result in axonal damage. To avoid these issues, remove the medium pointing the pipette towards the external side of the wells; similarly, pipette the fresh medium on the side of the wells located opposite to the chambers.\nDuring the culture period, co-cultures can be easily imaged by time-lapse microscopy. Co-cultures can be maintained for over 10 days.\nAfter the culture period, wash the chambers by pipetting 150 µl of PBS into one well per chamber, and letting PBS flow through the chambers three times.\nRemove the PBS and fix the samples by pipetting 150 µl of paraformaldehyde 4% (in PBS) in one well per chamber; incubate at RT for 15 min.\nWash the chambers twice with PBS as described in 3.6.\nProceed with further analysis.\nSubscription Required.
