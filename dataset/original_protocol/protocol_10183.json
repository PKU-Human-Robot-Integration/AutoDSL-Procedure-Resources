    "All animal surgical procedures described below were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Medical University of South Carolina prior to any animal surgeries or use of any animal tissues.\n1. Murine Nephrectomy\nDon a surgical mask and bouffant cap to minimize the risk of contamination. Maintain sterility during set-up of the surgical area.\n\t\nPlace non-fenestrated surgical drapes on the operating table.\nOpen the pack of autoclaved instruments onto the sterile drapes. The instruments required for nephrectomy include 3 small hemostats, fine forceps with teeth, fine forceps without teeth, and straight iris scissors.\nPlace another non-fenestrated surgical drape in the center of the operating table.\nPrepare 5 mL of Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) with calcium and magnesium, supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 15-mL sterile conical tube. Place this solution on ice next to the operating table.\nObtain an 8 - 12 week old C57BL/6 mouse (male or female) from the animal housing complex.\nPlace the mouse inside an anesthesia induction chamber and induce with 3.5% inhaled isoflurane. Place a nose cone on the mouse, using 2% isoflurane for maintenance anesthesia.\n\t\nMonitor for adequate depth of anesthesia periodically throughout the surgical procedure by assessing for pedal reflex (firm toe pinch).\nRemove all of the hair from the ventral torso using hair removal cream. Rinse this area with distilled water to ensure all hair has been removed from the abdomen.\nTransfer the mouse to the sterile operating table in supine position under the top non-fenestrated drape. Cut out a 2 x 2 cm2 fenestration in the drape just overlying the mouse abdomen.\nApply povidone-iodine followed by 70% ethanol to the abdomen using sterile gauze or cotton balls.",
    "Using fine forceps with teeth and iris scissors, make a 3 - 4 cm vertical abdominal skin incision parallel to the midline, 0.5 cm to the left of midline\nNote: If attempting to remove the right kidney, this will be an incision 0.5 cm to the right of midline.\n\t\nGrasp the peritoneum with fine forceps without teeth and incise with iris scissors to enter the abdominal cavity. Apply hemostats to the superior and inferior lateral edges of skin and peritoneum to place tension laterally and enhance exposure.\nShift the intestinal contents delicately to the right side of the abdomen to expose the left kidney. Gently place traction on the kidney to elevate it out of the abdomen.\nPlace a hemostat across the hilum of the left kidney. Use iris scissors to transect the ureter and renal vessels.\nPlace the left kidney in the 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin DPBS Solution on ice.\nTransfer the tube containing the kidney to the sterile tissue culture hood. Transfer the kidney from the 15-mL conical tube to a 60-mm petri dish (Figure 1). Rinse twice using 5 mL DPBS with calcium and magnesium. Keep the kidney suspended in 5 mL DPBS in the 60-mm dish.\n\t\t\nPrepare an additional 60 mm petri dish with 5 mL DPBS to be used during the microdissection protocol.\nEuthanize the mouse by thoracotomy and exsanguination following the procurement of the kidney, according to an approved IACUC animal protocol.\n2. Murine Kidney Microdissection for Renal Segment Isolation\nContinue using sterile technique for this portion of the protocol, including sterile gloves, surgical mask, and bouffant to minimize contamination risk.",
    "Place sterile drapes on the stereo microscope platform as well as to the areas just left and right of the microscope to have a sterile field for instruments. Place plastic adhesive sheets on microscope focus knobs and spray with 70% ethanol. Turn on the dual gooseneck illuminator to light the stage.\nOpen sterilized instruments (fine forceps without teeth, scalpel handle, #15 scalpel blade, two straight hemostats, two 30½ gauge hollow-bore needles) onto sterile drapes. Place the #15 blade onto the scalpel handle now and attach one hemostat to each needle adaptor/hub to create needle dissection instruments for later use, as shown in Figure 1.\nMove the 60-mm petri dishes, one containing the kidney in DPBS and the other only DPBS, from the tissue culture hood to the microscope area.\n\t\nPlace the 60-mm petri dish under the objective and remove the lid to expose the kidney. Leave the DPBS-containing dish to the side on the sterile field for later use.\nMove the dish so that only the anterior or posterior surface of the kidney is in view (i.e., the large flat face of the kidney, with the other face touching the bottom of the dish). Zoom to 3.2 - 4X for this portion of the procedure. Using the non-dominant hand, use fine forceps without teeth to pierce and pin the kidney against the dish near the inferior and superior poles of the kidney.\nKeep the non-dominant hand in place to pin the kidney. With the dominant hand, use the #15 blade to remove the translucent fibrous capsular layer from the exposed surface. Shave the most superficial 0.5 mm from the exposed surface of the kidney to remove the remainder of the capsule.",
    "Use the #15 blade to dissect an inverted pyramid of tissue from the decapsulated area, approximately 2 mm3 in size. Retrieve the 60-mm dish containing only DPBS and place the pyramid of tissue into the clean dish. Discard the remainder of the kidney.\nDecrease magnification to 1.5 - 2.0X for the rest of the dissection. Using two hemostat-needle instruments as cutting instruments, slice the tissue fragment into progressively smaller pieces until the tissue segments are less than or equal to the diameter of the needle tips. A renal tissue 2 mm3 in size will produce more than 50 segments once completely dissected.\nMove the 60-mm dish with renal segments to the tissue culture hood. Remove DPBS with 1000 µL pipette. Add 5 mL DMEM, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nCulture for 3 days at 37 °C in an incubator or implant into cellular constructs immediately.\n3. Renal Segment Cellular Construct Fabrication\nCulture normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and human adipose microvascular endothelial cells (HAMEC) for several weeks to obtain 7.2 x 105 fibroblasts and 1.8 x 105 endothelial cells per construct desired. In the tissue culture hood, seed the appropriate ratio of fibroblasts to endothelial cells (4:1) into rod-shaped wells in agarose molds to form scaffold-free pre-vascular endothelial-fibroblast constructs (SPEC) as previously described by Czajka et al19.\nObtain a sterilized hemostat, 30½ G needle, and a sterile spatula with flat end.\n\t\nRemove the majority of the media from the 60-mm plate containing renal segments, being careful not to aspirate and remove the renal segments.\nEquip surgical Loupes to visualize implantation of the segments.",
    "Scrape the end of the spatula gently along the bottom of the 60-mm dish to obtain 10 - 15 segments, spread out evenly along the very tip of the spatula. Place the tip of the spatula as close as possible to the lip of the well where the SPEC was seeded.\nUse a hemostat-30½ G needle instrument in the other hand to move each individual segment from the spatula tip to the edge of the well. Gently move each segment down into the well using the needle tip until slightly submerged in the previously seeded cellular suspension.\nCulture renal segment-SPEC in 2:1:1 ratio of FGM-2/EGM-2/DMEM medium (2.5 mL volume total). Change culture media every 24 h for 3 days. Remove the constructs from the molds at 72 h and fix or flash-freeze for processing.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
