    "1. Set up: Frame and Clamp Design for Holding the Animal\nThe frame and clamp to hold the animal was custom-designed to accommodate the Infinite Horizon (IH) Spinal Cord Injury Impactor.\nThe base of the frame is an aluminum platform cut into the following dimensions (30.2 cm x 20.3 cm x 1.3 cm) in order to fit into the table guide bracket that comes standard with the IH device (Figure 1A).\nFour Flexaframe support foot plates (Fisher Scientific, Toronto, ON) are attached to the platform and eight Flexaframe support rods (Fisher Scientific, Toronto, ON, 30.5 cm) are assembled using eight Flexaframe support connectors (Figure 1B).\nTwo additional Flexaframe support connectors, attached to the middle two rods, house the custom made holds for the clamp (Figure 1B).\nThe angle by which the animal's spinal cord is rotated with respect to vertical is established by keeping one of the horizontal rod in place and varying the height of the other horizontal rod (Figure 2).\nThe clamp is 35.6 mm long, 25.4 mm high and with a 7.6 mm jaw designed to rigidly grab hold underneath the transverse process from C4 to C6 (Figure 1C). Additional details on the clamp design have been described previously by Choo et al., 2009.\n2. Surgery\nMale Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 300-350 g were anesthetized by isoflurane (4% for induction and 2% for maintenance) in oxygen (1 L/min).\nOnce the animals are under the plane of anesthesia, the animal is placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf, Tujunga, CA).\nTo minimize bleeding during the surgical procedure 0.4 mL of lidocaine (20 mg/mL; Bimeda-MTC Animal Health Inc., Cambridge, Ontario, Canada) with epinephrine is injected intramuscularly around the surgical site in the dorsal neck region.",
    "A 4-5 cm dorsal midline incision is made using a sterile scalpel (#15), starting from the base of the skull and extending caudally.\nSterile Adson forceps are used to bluntly dissect through the dorsal musculature to reach the spine, and a sterile Alm retractor (Fine Science Tools, North Vancouver, BC) is inserted to keep the muscles spread apart.\nUsing the #15 scalpel, the muscles overlaying the laminae of C4-C7 are scraped off, starting in the midline and sweeping them out laterally.\nAn incision with a sterile scalpel (#15) is made to the muscle attached to the transverse processes on both side of the spine in order to fit the clamp underneath the transverse processes of C4 to C6.\nWith a sterile fine tipped Friedman-Pearson Rongeur (Fine Science Tools, North Vancouver, BC), the left C5 lamina is carefully removed to visualize the dura and the spinal cord.\nA rod with a diameter of 1.5 mm is slid under the arms to prop the animal up, thereby raising the spine slightly and facilitating clamp insertion.\nMount the jaw of the sterile clamp onto lateral transverse processes of C4 to C6 and tighten the screws.\nRemove the Alm retractor.\n3. Spinal Cord Injury\nAfter the clamp is mounted on the animal, the animal is moved to the IH impactor.\nThe clamp is inserted into the metal holders on the two middle rods of the frame that have been secured at an angle of 22.5° off of horizontal (Figure 2).\nThe scissor jack that provides stable height adjustments, (VWR, Mississauga, ON) is raised up until the animal lays flat.",
    "Ensure that the clamp is horizontal by placing a small cylinder level on top of the clamp and by tightening the screws. It is important that all the screws are tight and the set up is rigid without any movement.\nThe remainder of the procedure is conducted under a microscope (Leica MZ8).\nLower and aim the impactor tip (15 mm in diameter, with rounded-off edges ) using the vertical adjustment knob and the two horizontal adjustment knobs on the IH impactor until the center of the impactor tip is hovering above the apex of C6 spinous process.\nOnce the impactor tip is centered, turn the y-axis adjustment knob one and two fifth turn (1.4 mm) to move the tip laterally to the left side and the x axis horizontal adjustment knob to move the impactor tip to the center of C5.\nLower the tip until it is just above the dura to verify that the impactor tip is aiming the lateral half of the grey matter.\nTurn the vertical adjustment knob two turns to raise the tip 4 mm above the dura.\nEnsure that the impact area is dry by using a cotton swab or stick.\nSet the desired force to 150 kdyn on the program and click \"Start Experiment\" to trigger the impactor.\nAfter the injury, the wound is closed in layers with 5-0 vicryl sutures. Buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg SC, Temgesic; Schering-Plough Corporation, Kenilworth, NJ)  and Saline (10 mL) is administered subcutaneously before and twice daily for two days after surgery.  Animals are closely monitored twice a day for 2 weeks and one a week for 6 weeks post-injury.  \n4. Representative Results",
    "Twenty Nine male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 300-350 g were injured at a force setting of 150 kdyn. The impactor tip was aimed 1.4 mm lateral to midline, at an angle of 22.5° off of vertical. The mean actual force was 155.55 ± 0.73 kdyn. The mean displacement was 1512.72 ± 27.86 μm and the velocity was 120.24 ± 0.52 mm/s (Figure 3).\nBehavior Outcome Measures\nFunctional recovery was assessed using the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, grooming test, and modified Montoya staircase test1.  Animals were trained before injury and assessed at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-injury. There were significant forelimb impairments sustained throughout the experimental period.\nHorizontal Ladder test. Before the injury, animals made only 4.75 ± 0.73% errors on the ipsilateral forelimb while traversing across the irregularly spaced horizontal ladder. Following the injury, the animals demonstrated marked increases in the percentage of forelimb errors. The ipsilateral forelimb percent errors were 26.97 ± 2.92%, 26.23 ± 2.84% and 22.06 ± 2.05% at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-injury, respectively (Figure 4A). Importantly, the forelimb impairment on this test was sustained for the 6 weeks.\nCylinder Rearing test. The percentage of ipsilateral forelimb (left + both) usage during exploration decreased significantly after SCI. Prior to the injury, the animals used the ipsilateral forelimb 75.12 ± 2.25%. After the injury the animals used the ipsilateral forelimb 8.59 ± 1.80% at 2 weeks, 14.25 ± 2.65% at 4 weeks and 11.76 ± 2.66% at 6 weeks (Figure 4B).",
    "Modified Montoya Staircase test. The number of pellets retrieved with the ipsilateral forelimb decreased dramatically after the injury. Prior to the injury, the animals collected 84.85 ± 2.88% of the food rewards. However, at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-injury, the animals retrieved only 30.91 ± 4.03%, 28.94 ± 4.38% and 25.86 ± 3.09% of the pellets (Figure 4C).\nGrooming test. There were dramatic decreases in the grooming scores after injury. After SCI, the ipsilateral grooming scores were 2 weeks: 2.00 ± 0.17, 4 weeks: 1.83 ± 0.17 and 6 weeks: 1.79 ± 0.11 (Figure 4D).\nHistological Outcomes\nWhite matter and Grey matter sparing. An example of a spinal cord injury at a force of 150 kdyn, angle of 22.5° and lateral aim of 1.4 mm is presented in Figure 5. The injury resulted in substantial damage to the grey and white matter on the ipsilateral side. Both corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts were injured and 23 out of 29 animals had parenchymal damage contained on the ipsilateral side. The longitudinal extent of the damage of the white and grey matter was 2400 rostrally and 2400 caudally (Figure 6). When adding the sections to provide a gross estimation of the \"cumulative spread\" of white and grey matter sparing (2000 μm rostral and caudal to the epicenter), the ipsilateral side had only 51.8% of the white matter spared and 39.7% of grey matter remaining compared to the contralateral side (Figure 6).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3313/3313fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Representative force and displacement graphs for Infinite Horizon impactor. The arrow indicates the time that the impactor tip has reached 20 kdyn and the point when the recording of displacement is initiated. The actual force is read from the peak of the force vs. time curve and the corresponding displacement is calculated. The graphs below depict a typical 150 kdyn contusion, A. Displacement vs. time graph, B. Force vs. Time graph. These graphs show that the actual force achieved was 152 kdyn, and the impactor displacement into the cord was measured to be 1287 μm.
