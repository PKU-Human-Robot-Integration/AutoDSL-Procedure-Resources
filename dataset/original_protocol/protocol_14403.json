    "This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Saitama Medical University International Medical Center and Yokohama Rosai Hospital (approval #: 16-093 and 26-38, respectively). Written consent was obtained from all patients prior to the procedure.\n1. Patient Preparation\nSet the patient on the examination bed.\nPlace a venous line in an upper arm (or left leg) for the administration of medication during the procedure.\nInsert the access sheath into the right femoral vein after appropriate skin disinfection and local anesthesia.\nCollect a blood sample (1 mL) from the right femoral vein (peripheral blood sample before the administration of cosyntropin).\n2. Catheterization\nssAVS of right adrenal TVs\nInsert either the catheter with the MK Adrenal-R shape (Figure 1A and 1B) or the catheter with the MK X shape (Figure 1C) into the right adrenal vein (RAV) as previously reported 15,16, collect a blood sample (1 mL), and remove the catheter (right cAVS sample before the administration of cosyntropin). Use the micro-catheter if needed.\nSelect an appropriate parent catheter for the right adrenal: When the \"long diameter of the IVC\" is shorter than 25 mm, use MK Adrenal-R. Otherwise, use MK X.\nRe-shape the parent catheter if needed.\n\t\t\nBased on CT images, re-shape the width of the selected catheter (red bidirectional arrows in Figure 1A or 1C) to fit the \"long diameter of the IVC\"15 (also see Case #1) and the angle of the catheter tip to fit the \"modified transverse angle of the RAV\"15 (also see Case #1).\nRe-shape the catheter while applying high temperature steam from boiled water (e.g. electronic kettle) to the catheters. Detailed procedures are described elsewhere15.\nPlace the tip of the parent catheter into the RAV with an appropriate angle (average modified transverse angle of the RAV: 123.6 °)15 and depth (1 - 2 mm).",
    "NOTE: Accurate parent catheter placement is essential for delivery of the micro-catheter into the target TV.\nManipulate the parent catheter to change the direction of the catheter tip to aim for one of the right TVs, and insert a saline-filled micro-catheter with a guidewire.\n\t\tNOTE: Pushing and pulling the parent catheter will change the vertical angle of the parent catheter, i.e. when the 3D-type catheter is pulled toward the foot, the catheter tip is directed upwards, whereas the catheter tip is directed downwards when the catheter is pushed (see Case #1 below). Once the tip of catheter is inserted into the RAV exit with an appropriate angle and depth, the micro-catheter may be inserted. It is important for the examiner to prevent a patient from breathing deeply or the vertical angle may change. The micro-catheter described above is inserted with a guidewire into a TV.\nPerform venography using digital subtraction angiography through the micro-catheter with a small amount of saline-diluted (1:1) contrast-medium (0.1 - 0.3 mL; iopromide injection) and flush it gently. Collect a 1-mL blood sample slowly for the measurement of plasma aldosterone concentrations (PAC) and plasma cortisol concentrations (PCC).\nPull the micro-catheter slightly back, and flush the micro-catheter line with at least 0.5 mL of saline. Aim the parent catheter tip at the next TV.\nRepeat steps 2.1.6 and 2.1.7 above for all right TVs.\nssAVS of left adrenal TVs\nInsert an L shape catheter (Figure 2) into the left adrenal vein (LAV), collect a blood sample (1 mL), and remove the catheter (left cAVS sample before the administration of cosyntropin). Use the micro-catheter.\nPlace the parent catheter.",
    "NOTE: Anatomically, the left adrenal central vein is confluent with the inferior phrenic vein, and venous blood in these veins flows into LAV8. Therefore, to only collect venous blood samples from left adrenal tissues, catheterization into the left adrenal central vein is needed, i.e., catheterization into the point before merging with the inferior phrenic vein, which typically requires micro-catheterization, even for cAVS. While performing adrenal central venography, similar to the right side, it is important to identify left adrenal TVs, particularly lateral TV (see \"Case #2 as an example of LAV-ssAVS\"). A catheter with the L shape was preferred for use. Portions #1, #2, and #3 (Figure 2) of the catheter fit the IVC, renal vein, as well as common trunk of the inferior phrenic vein and LAV, respectively, thereby allowing portion #3 to stably sit in the common trunk.\nInsert the micro-catheter into left adrenal TVs and collect blood samples from left TVs. See Steps 2.1.5 - 2.1.6 above for right adrenal TVs for general procedures.\n\t\tNOTE: The micro-catheter and guidewire (the same as those in the right ssAVS) are inserted into TVs (typically the superior-median, superior-lateral, and lateral TVs) as described in Case #2 below, and blood samples are collected.\n3. After Injections\nInject 200 µg of synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (cosyntropin, bolus) through the venous line followed by the continuous administration of cosyntropin at a rate of 50 µg/min.\nFifteen minutes after the bolus cosyntropin injection, perform cAVS again, as described above, and ssAVS, as described in steps 2.1 and 2.2. Collect 1 mL blood each.\nCollect a blood sample from the right femoral vein.\nRemove all catheters and access sheath, and complete the cAVS and ssAVS examinations after astriction.",
