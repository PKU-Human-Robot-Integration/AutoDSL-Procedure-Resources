    "Di-ubiquitin formation assayPrepare three reaction mixes in 1.5 mL tubes on ice containing the following reagents: 100 nM E1, 2.5 µM E2, 2.5 µM E2 variant, and 100 µM ubiquitin, in a buffer of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 5 mM ATP in a total volume of 40 µL. Typical reagent concentrations and volumes are given in Table 1. If a controlled reaction start is desired, the E1 or ATP can be omitted from the reaction mix during setup and added to initiate the reaction (mix by gently flicking the tube or stirring with a pipette tip during the final reagent addition). Three control reactions should also be performed, omitting either the E2, the E2 variant, or both the E2 and E2 variant, demonstrating that di-ubiquitin formation is not a consequence of activity from either the E2 or E2 variant alone, or from activity of the E1.Table 1.

    "*Can be excluded in the E3 cooperation assay**Include only in the E3 cooperation assayIncubate the reaction mixes in a dry block heater at 37 °C for 0 min, 30 min, and 90 min.Stop the reactions by adding 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (13.3 µL) (see Recipes).Heat the samples at 70 °C for 5 min using a dry block heater.Run 20 µL of each sample on a NuPAGE mini protein gel in 1× NuPAGE MES-SDS running buffer using an electrophoresis system. Load 5 µL of SeeBlue Plus2 pre-stained protein standard to a single lane of the gel to enable molecular weight comparison of bands detected later during the western blot. Run the gel at 200 V until the lowest molecular weight marker is approximately 0.25 cm from the bottom of the gel (approximately 35 min). If analysis of both ubiquitin conjugates and K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates is desired, run two gels with 20 µL samples from each reaction on each gel. When assessing the presence of K63-linked ubiquitin, a sample of 100 ng K63-linked di-ubiquitin should be included on the gel, which will act as a positive control when blotting with the Ub-K63 antibody.Incubate the gel in 20% ethanol in a square Petri dish for 10 min on a gel rocker at room temperature.Transfer the proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot 2 Dry Blotting System and an iBlot 2 nitrocellulose transfer stack according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Perform the transfer at 20 V for 1 min, then 23 V for 4 min, and finally 25 V for 7 min.Assessing the formation of ubiquitin conjugates using the FK2-antibody (Ubiquigent) Block the membrane by covering it with 5% BSA dissolved in 1× TBSt (see Recipes) in a square Petri dish on a microplate shaker at 4 °C overnight.",
    "Apply the mono and polyubiquitylated conjugates, mAb (FK2) antibody at a 1:1,000 dilution in 10 mL of 1% BSA in 1× TBSt in a square Petri dish.

Incubate at 4 °C on a microplate shaker for 1 h.Wash the membrane in 1× TBSt for 10 min three times at room temperature in a square Petri dish on a microplate shaker operating at speed 4.Apply clarity Western ECL substrate according to manufacturer’s instructions.Measure chemiluminescence using a suitable imaging system (e.g., ChemiDoc imaging system, Bio-Rad).Assessing the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates using the Ub-K63 antibody (ThermoFisher) Block the membrane by covering it with 5% (w/v) milk dissolved in 1× TBSt. Incubate in a square Petri dish on a microplate shaker at 4 °C for 1 h.Apply the Ub-K63 mouse antibody at 1:250 dilution in 5 ml of 5% milk in 1× TBSt in a square Petri dish.

    "E3 cooperation assayPrepare reaction mixes in 1.5 mL reaction tubes on ice containing the following reagents: 100 nM E1, 2.5 µM E2, 1 µM E3, and 100 µM ubiquitin in a buffer of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 5 mM ATP in a total volume of 40 µL. Where relevant, 2.5 µM of an E2 variant can also be included (e.g., when involved in di-ubiquitin formation in conjunction with an E2). Typical reagent concentrations and volumes are given in Table 1. If a controlled reaction start is desired, the E1 or ATP can be omitted from the reaction mix during setup and added to initiate the reaction (mix by gently flicking the tube or stirring with a pipette tip during the final reagent addition).To determine whether the observed activity is due to the E3, four control reactions should be carried out, omitting either the E3, the E2, the E2 variant, or both the E2 and E2 variant. This allows for the assessment of any activity that may be a consequence of the E1 and E2s in the absence of the E3, and also whether the E3 works in cooperation with the E2 or E2 variant, alone or in combination.Incubate reactions in a dry block heater at 30 °C for 60 min or other times as required.Carry out steps A3–A21."
