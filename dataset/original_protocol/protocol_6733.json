    "A schematic of the procedure is also provided bellow (Figure 2).Culture preparationInoculate 1 ml of SP4 liquid medium with 10 μl of each saturated liquid growth culture of M. agalactiae (standard bacterial stock at ~109 CFU/ml) previously stored at -80 °C in the absence of glycerol or particular storage conditions and defrosted at room temperature.Incubate the culture at 37 °C for 24 h without shaking in an incubator #.#Note: Growth rate depends on the M. agalactiae strain and can vary from 16 h to 48 h of incubation in SP4 medium. Change from red to orange of the phenol-red present in the SP4 medium indicates optimal growth.Mating procedureMix 1 ml# of each saturated mycoplasma culture (between 108 and 109 CFU/ml) in a 2 ml sterile microcentrifuge tubes.# Note: The ratio of donor:recipient mycoplasma cells should be close to 1:1. Depending on the assays or on the concentration of the two mycoplasma cultures (e.g., due to differences in growth rates), the ratio can be changed to 1:2 (vol:vol) or 1:10 (vol:vol) in the same final volume of 2 ml. Centrifuge the 2 ml mixed cultures for 5 min at 8,000 x g at room temperature (20-25 °C).Carefully discard the supernatant using a 1 ml micropipette.Resuspend the pellets with 1 ml of SP4 liquid medium at room temperature, proceed to 2 to 3 drawing/discharging cycles with a 1 ml micropipette.Incubate over night# at 37 °C without shaking.#Note: Conjugation events can be observed after 3 h of incubation, but the highest mating frequency is observed after at least 16 h. PlatingA part of the mating mix (10 to 50 µl) is used to determine the total CFU#.",
    "For this purpose, prepare serial dilutions in DPBS 1x + 5% decomplemented FBS (from 10-1 to 10-7) and spot 10 µl of each dilution onto a SP4 agar plate containing no selective pressure.#Note: If the conjugation efficiency is expressed by the ratio of transconjugants/donor cells or transconjugant/recipient cells, spot 10 µl of each dilution onto a SP4 agar plate containing the antibiotic marker corresponding to the donor/recipient strain, at the appropriate concentration. Inoculate 300 µl of the mating mix onto selective SP4 agar plates. Spread the liquid onto the surface of the Petri dish (90 mm) by gentle circular movements so that the entire dish (except the edges) is covered#.#Note: All the mating mix can be plated in 3 Petri dishes. For highly efficient matings, dilutions should be made before plating (1/10x, 1/100x maximum). These dilutions are made with sterile DPBS 1x complemented with 5% decomplemented FBS in microcentrifuge tubes. The mating mixture can be stored as such directly at -80 °C if necessary.Incubate the SP4 agar plates at 37 °C for 3 to 5 days#.#Note: To prevent desiccation during incubation the Petri dishes should be stored inside closed plastic bags, in the 37 °C incubator. Calculation of conjugation frequenciesUsing the binocular magnifier (10x-63x), count the Colony Forming Unit (CFU) on the 10µl dilution spots or the 300 µl spreads (Figure 2) of each selective and non-selective SP4 agar plates.Calculate the mating frequency# as the CFUs grown in both selective markers (i.e., TetR and GmR) divided by the total CFU obtained in dilution spots spread on SP4 agar without selective pressure.",
    "#Note: The conjugation frequency can also be expressed as the number of transconjugants per donor or recipient cell by dividing the CFU cultivated in the two selective markers, by the CFU cultivated with only one of the two selective marker (that of the donor, or that of the recipient, see note above). At least three independent experiments should be performed for reliable and reproducible data.Picking, cloning and storage of transconjugantsPick colonies with a sterile 200 µl micropipette sterile tip and transfer it into 1 ml of SP4 liquid medium supplemented with the 2 appropriate antibiotics.Incubate at 37 °C for 24 to 96 h#.#Note: Transconjugants can be directly stored at -80 °C at this stage .To ensure the clonality of transconjugants, three successive subcloning steps can be performed as previously described (Rosengarten et al., 1994), with the last broth culture being filtered through a 0.22 µm pore filter before storage at -80 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3893/bioprotoc-11-02-3893-g002.jpgFigure 2. Schematic representing M. agalactiae mating procedure. Here, as an example, the M. agalactaiae strain 5632 (ICE containing strain, ICE+) was mated with strain PG2 (ICE-). Prior to mating, strains were independently tagged by stably inserting the gentamicin resistance gene (GmR, in purple) or the tetracycline resistance gene (TetR, in green) in their genome, using the pMT85 plamid (Baranowski et al., 2010). Saturated cultures of each of these strains (≈ 109 CFU/ml) were mixed in equal proportion (1 ml each), gently centrifuged, resuspended in fresh SP4 medium and incubated together. The mix culture was then directly plated on appropriate selective medium and dilutions were inoculated onto selective and non-selective plates to determine the conjugation frequency.Verification of putative transconjugantsCentrifuge a 1 ml culture of cloned transconjugants at 12,000 x g for 25 min at 4 °C.",
    "Remove the supernatant and add 50 μl of lysis buffer (see Recipes section) to the cell pelletIncubate at 37 °C for 1 h.Inactivate the proteinase K contained in the lysis buffer by heating at 95 °C for 10 min.Perform PCR amplifications using specific primers targeting the resistance genes present in the parental strains used for mating (Table 1) (Dordet-Frisoni et al., 2014). To do this, take 2 µl of the lysed transconjugants culture and perform the PCR using the standard Taq DNA polymerase procedure (here, Taq DNA polymerase from NEB).Identify transconjugant genomic backbone by PCR using a set of 7 primer pairs (Table 2) that covers clockwise the M. agalactiae genome and produces PCR fragments specific of the M. agalactiae genomes (Dordet-Frisoni et al., 2014) or by whole genome sequencing (Illumina) (Dordet-Frisoni et al., 2019).Table 1.
