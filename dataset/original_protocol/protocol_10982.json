    "Human-biopsied tissues were obtained from the respective patient at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital and Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, and informed consent was obtained from the patients. See the Table of Materials for details about all materials, reagents, and instruments used in this protocol.\n1. Establishing patient-derived HCC organoids from surgical samples\nNOTE: The establishment of HCC organoids encompasses various stages, namely tissue dissociation, organoid plating, culture, passaging, cryopreservation, and resuscitation. The process of tissue dissociation requires a duration of 2 h, while the seeding of organoids onto a plate takes approximately 40 min. Following this, the initial generation of HCC organoids undergoes a culture period of 10-14 days using HCC isolation medium. Once a satisfactory density is achieved, organoid passages are conducted, which requires 1 h. Subsequent cultures of the organoids are then maintained using HCC expansion medium for 7-10 days, which may vary depending on the growth rate and condition of the organoids.\nTissue dissociation\n\t\nPreparation of supplies and materials\n\t\t\nCollect 1-2 cm3 of HCC tissue from patients who have not received any previous local or systemic treatment before the operation. After surgical resection, keep the tissue at 4 °C in tissue preservation solution (Table 1) until processing.\n\t\t\tNOTE: High-quality fresh tissue samples are essential for the successful establishment of organoids. It is important to process samples promptly, ideally within 1-4 h after surgical resection to maintain tissue viability. Perform all subsequent procedures in an aseptic environment using sterile materials and reagents.\nPreheat ultra-low attachment surface cell culture plates (24 wells) for 1 h in an incubator at 37 °C. Thaw the frozen basement membrane extract (BME) overnight at 4 °C until just before use.",
    "NOTE: To ensure complete thawing of the BME, it must be placed on ice for at least 3 h. Complete melting of the BME is essential for successful organoid culture in the subsequent steps.\nBefore use, ensure that the digestion solution (Table 1) is warmed to a temperature of 37 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Prepare the digestion solution freshly in an aseptic environment and utilize it promptly.\nOrganizational processing flow\n\t\t\nIn a laminar flow cabinet, cut the tumor tissue into small pieces (0.5-1 mm3) using surgical scissors on a Petri dish. Transfer the clipped tissue to a 15 mL conical tube and add 5-10 mL of basal medium (Table 1).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The basal medium (Table 1) can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nUse a barotropic pipette to wash away as much blood as possible and let it stand for 1-2 min to remove some of the supernatant, including any blood cells and floating fat clots. Repeat this procedure twice.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and carefully remove the supernatant. Add 5 mL of the prewarmed digestion solution (Table 1) to the trimmed tissue.\nRotate the tube at 37 °C for digestion.\nAfter 30 min of initial digestion, look for small clusters of cells under the microscope. Check every 5-10 min to avoid overdigestion.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The time required for tissue digestion will depend on the size and type of tissue. Tissue digestion should not exceed 90 min. Overdigested tissue will appear under the microscope as a large sheet of individual cells. The appropriate level of digestion is indicated by the fact that most of these are cell clusters and have a grape-like appearance.",
    "Stop digestion by adding cold basal medium (Table 1) and filter into a new 50 mL tube with a 100 µm cell filter. Add cold basal medium to a volume of 50 mL.\nCentrifuge the cells at 2 × g for 10 min at 8 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet by adding a further 50 mL of cold basal medium (Table 1). Repeat this step twice.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Low-speed centrifugation is used to allow small cell clusters to settle down, while blood cells and cell debris are still suspended in the supernatant; the process is repeated several times to obtain a relatively pure tissue cell mass.\nOrganoid plating\n\t\nAfter the second wash, remove as much of the supernatant as possible and resuspend the desired number of cells (1,000-5,000 cells per well of a 24-well plate) in the appropriate BME for plating.\n\t\tNOTE: Always keep the BME at 4 °C before use.\nAdd BME and suspend small cell clusters in Advanced DMEM/F-12 by adding BME and gently pipetting up and down until the cell aggregates are completely suspended. Control the concentration of the BME between 30% and 50%.\nSeed 50 µL BME droplets mixed with cell clusters in the center of 24-well culture plates.\n\t\tNOTE: As far as possible, do not let the droplets spread to the sidewall of the well plate. The sidewall of the low-adsorption plate is not in a low-adsorption state, and contact between the droplets and the sidewall will lead to adhesion, which is not conducive to the subsequent incubation.\nAllow the plates with the added droplets to solidify at 37 °C for 20 min. At the end of the incubation, add 500 µL of prewarmed medium (Table 1) to each well and incubate in a cell incubator at 37 °C.\nOrganoid culture",
    "Refresh the culture medium (Table 1) once every 2-3 days. At the beginning of the culture, culture the HCC organoids in HCC isolation medium (Table 1) for 2 weeks.\nAfter 2 weeks of incubation with HCC isolation medium, replace the medium with HCC organoid expansion medium (Table 1) (stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks).\nRefresh the culture medium once every 3 days.\nAfter 7-10 days of culturing with HCC expansion medium when the organoid has reached the appropriate density or size, initiate experimental interventions or passage or lyophilize the organoids as needed.\nOrganoid passaging\n\t\nPreparation of supplies and materials\n\t\t\nPreheat ultra-low attachment surface cell culture plates (24 wells) for 1 h in an incubator at 37 °C. Thaw frozen BME overnight at 4 °C until just before use.\nPrewarm organoid harvest solution and trypsin substitute at 37 °C for 30 min.\npassaging process\n\t\t\nAfter removing the culture medium from the well plate, transfer the organoid suspension to a 15 mL tube.\nAdd organoid harvesting solution according to the amount of BME (500 µL of organoid harvesting solution per 50 µL of BME) by scraping and pipetting up and down using a 1,000 µL pipette gun.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Avoid air bubbles throughout the process to prevent loss of organoids as the presence of air bubbles indicates higher pipetting pressure.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nGently aspirate the BME with a 1,000 µL pipette and observe that the BME is completely dissolved. Observe every 10 min until a clear organoid cell cluster is observed, then centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature and remove as much of the supernatant as possible.\n\t\t\tNOTE: At this stage, the organoid can be frozen and preserved.",
    "For enzymatic digestion of organoids, add 1-5 mL of the trypsin substitute (according to the number of organoids) and incubate at 37 °C for 2 min. Observe under the microscope the degree of enzymatic digestion to determine whether the organoids dissociate into small clusters of 2-10 cells; if not, continue the enzymatic digestion.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Overdigestion will result in the lysis of organoid cell clusters into single cells, decreasing their viability and prolonging subsequent culture time.\nAdd the appropriate volume of cold basal medium (Table 1) to stop the digestion.\nCentrifuge the organoids at 400 × g for 5 min at 8 °C; remove the supernatant as much as possible.\nResuspend the desired number of organoids (1,000-5,000 organoids per well of a 24-well plate) in the appropriate matrix for plating. Follow the same steps as in section 1.2.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The plating density should be optimized according to the growth rate and size of the organoids.\nPassage the organoids every 10 days at a ratio of 1:3 or 1:4 depending on the density of organoid growth.\nOrganoid cryopreservation and resuscitation\n\t\nCryopreservation of organoids\n\t\t\nPrepare lyophilization tubes, each tube confluent with two wells of a 24-well plate containing organoids.\nFollow steps 1.4.2.1 to 1.4.2.4 for organoid passaging to obtain organoids without BME, and gently resuspend the organoids by adding 500 µL/well of organoid lyophilization solution to a 24-well plate.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Depending on the growth status and size of the organoids, it is recommended to cryopreserve the organoids in culture up to the third generation.\nTransfer the suspension into lyophilization tubes and place it in a gradient-cooled box at -80 °C. After gradient cooling at -80 °C for at least 24 h, transfer the tubes to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nResuscitation of organoids",
    "Incubate lyophilized tubes in a 37 °C water bath and stop incubation when only a small block of ice remains.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 8 °C to remove the supernatant completely.\nFollow sections 1.2 and 1.3 for subsequent operations.\nSubscription Required.
