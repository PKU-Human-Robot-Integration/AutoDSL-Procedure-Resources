    "Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Duke University.\n1. Intranasal Administration of Fast Blue\nFor Fast Blue, administer the dye at least 2 days before euthanizing the mouse. The dye will persist for up to eight weeks.\nAnesthetize the mouse with light inhalation anesthesia (2.5% sevoflurane) until breathing starts to slow.\nUse a 200 µl pipette with filtered tips to slowly instill 40 µl of dye solution (0.4 mM Fast Blue, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, in phosphate buffered saline, PBS) into the nostril, pausing occasionally to ensure the mouse is aspirating the solution (Figure 1A).\nHold the mouse vertically, head up, and gently massage the chest to ensure the dye spreads throughout the lungs.\n2. Preparations on Dissection and Analysis Day\nPrepare 10 ml Ganglia Dissociation Solution (GaDS) by combining the ingredients as specified in Table 1.\nPerform RNA extraction in a dedicated lab area. Before beginning the experiment, clean surfaces with 70% ethanol, 10% bleach, and RNase decontamination reagent. This includes the RNA centrifuge, any tube racks, and pipettes. Ensure there are dedicated filter tip boxes for RNA use only. Do not use this equipment and area for DNA preparation, as this will contaminate the samples.\nMix fresh 70%, and 80% ethanol with RNase-free water. Prepare 1 ml per sample to be used in RNA extraction.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nIngredient,Amount\nAdvanced DMEM/f12,9.5 ml\nglutamine,100 µl\nHEPES (10 mM),100 µl\nN2 supplement,100 µl\nB27 (no vitamin A),200 µl\nNGF (50 µg/ml),10 µl\nTable 1. Reagent Mixture for Ganglia Dissociation Solution (GaDS).\n3. Dissection Procedure\nFill 1.5 ml tubes with 500 µl GaDS, one for each experimental sample, one for a positive sorting control, and one for a negative sorting control. Store tubes on ice throughout dissection.",
    "Dissect out the nodose ganglion and make two partial cuts to facilitate dissociation, then put it in the experimental sample tube. Please refer to the following JoVE protocol for dissection of the nodose ganglia16 and DRG17.\nDissect and partially cut non-labeled ganglia, such as the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), for the sorting controls. Use two ganglia for the positive control and two ganglia for the negative control.\nTo obtain enough nodose neurons for successful sorting, combine ganglia from 5 mice into one experimental sample tube containing GaDS.\n4. Sensory Ganglia Dissociation\nPipette out 500 µl GaDS, leaving ganglia in the tube. Wash ganglia once by adding 1 ml PBS, wait for ganglia to settle to the bottom of the tube, then pipette out PBS.\nAdd 1 ml GaDS and 22 µl of digestion enzyme (collagenase I/II and protease mix, 2.5 mg/ml in H2O) to each tube.\nAdd 20 µl Fast Blue (5.26 mM) to the positive control tube.\nPut the tubes in a water bath or heating block already set at 37 °C.\n\tNote: The time of ganglia digestion depends on the age of the digestion enzyme. Within 1 month of dissolving the digestion enzyme, digest for 30 min, within 2 - 6 months digest for 45 min. If the enzyme is over 6 months old, digest ganglia for 60 min.\nEvery 15 min shake tubes briefly and flick them to ensure ganglia are covered by the solution.\nWhile ganglia are being digested, prepare density gradients using a particle solution (colloidal silica particles coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone).\n\t\nMix 12% particle solution in GaDS, 500 µl per sample.\nMix 28% particle solution in GaDS, 500 µl per sample.",
    "Slowly and carefully add 400 µl 12% density solution on top of 400 µl 28% density solution in a fresh 1.5 ml tube for each sample. Do not allow the two layers to mix. Two distinct layers should be visible in the tube; one darker than the other.\nWhile ganglia are being digested, label new 1.5 ml collection tubes for sorting (one Fast Blue positive and one Fast Blue negative tube per sorting sample). Depending on the sorting facility requirements, these tubes must have detachable lids so as to not interfere with the cell sorter.\nAfter the appropriate digestion time, remove GaDS with digestion enzyme and wash ganglia twice with 1 ml PBS. Add 200 µl of fresh GaDS to each tube.\nUse a 200 µl pipette, set to 100 µl volume, and pipette ganglia up and down several times to break cells apart. Repeat until no intact piece of tissue is seen. Avoid creating bubbles in the solution.\nPass dissociated cells through a 70 µm cell strainer.\nAdd another 100 µl GaDS to the original dissociation tube to pick up any remaining stray cells left and pass the additional solution through the cell strainer. Using a new pipette tip, collect any remaining cell-containing liquid that has passed through the strainer and clung to the mesh. The final volume of cells suspended in GaDS is 300 µl.\nCarefully layer the 300 µl of cells on top of the previously made density gradient. Avoid bubbles and mixing of cells with the density layers.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 2,900 x g at RT.\nWhile cells are in the centrifuge, mix lysis buffer (1 ml per experimental sample) as follows: 10 µl 2-mercaptoethanol in 1 ml Buffer RLT (from RNA extraction kit).",
    "Add 300 µl lysis buffer to Fast Blue positive collection tube and 600 µl to Fast Blue negative collection tube (tubes labeled from step 4.7). This volume depends on the number of cells expected to be collected. For <2,000 cells, add 300 µl, for >7,000 cells add 600 µl. This will ensure the sorting sheath fluid does not significantly dilute the lysis buffer.\nOnce centrifugation is complete, carefully remove and discard the top 700 µl layer. This layer contains the majority of cell debris that will otherwise interfere with cell sorting.\nAdd 700 µl fresh GaDS to the remaining cell containing solution and pipette up and down several times to mix.\nCentrifuge for 15 min at 2,900 x g to pellet cells.\nWhile cells are in the centrifuge, mix sorting GaDS (500 µl per sample) by adding 5 µl DNase (10 mg/ml) to 1 ml GaDS.\nOnce centrifugation is done, carefully remove and discard supernatant, leaving the cell pellet.\nRe-suspend cell pellet in 200 - 300 µl sorting GaDS by pipetting up and down with a 1,000 µl pipette set to 200 µl several times. Put samples on ice. Cells are now ready to be sorted.\n5. Fluorescence Activated Cell (FAC) Sorting\nNote: This section requires operational knowledge of a FACS sorter or the assistance of skilled personnel.\nAdd 1 µl propidium iodide (PI) stock solution (50 µg/ml) to each sample to test for cell viability. Split negative control into 2 tubes, one with PI and one without. PI binds DNA only in dead cells. If after the first few sorts there are no dead cells to label, the use of PI is not needed.\nTransport cells to flow cytometry instrument, e.g., BD FACS AriaII running Diva 8 software, on ice.",
    "Since the cell size is variable in this population, use a large nozzle (100 µm) for sorting. To decrease the amount of stress the cells experience and increase cell viability use low pressure (20 psi).\nUse the FACS sorter software to set up the analysis plots, forward scatter, side scatter (SSC), Fast Blue, and PI, if needed.\nTo re-suspend cells, gently vortex the sample briefly before loading it into the sorter.\nBegin with the negative control, no Fast Blue or PI, to set the gate threshold (Figure 2A). This will determine the amount of autofluorescence in the cell population. Optional: Run the negative sample with PI to identify whether there is a population of dead cells.\nSort the positive control sample (incubated with Fast Blue), to set compensation parameters.\nOnce the gates and parameters are set, begin sorting the experimental samples. Samples are sorted into the prepared collection tubes containing RNA lysis buffer.\nKeep sorted samples on ice until the cell sorting is complete.\nBegin RNA extraction step immediately after cells are sorted.\n6. RNA Extraction\nVortex sorted cells in lysis buffer for 1 min to homogenize.\nAdd 1 volume of 70% ethanol and mix by pipetting up and down several times.\nTransfer up to 700 µl of the sample to a spin column. Centrifuge for 15 sec at 8,000 x g. Discard the flow-through.\n\t\nRepeat until the total volume of the sample is passed through the spin column.\nAdd 350 µl Buffer RW1 and continue the RNA purification process, including the DNase treatment step, according to the manufacturer's protocol for cells.\nOnce RNA has been extracted, test the RNA quality using a microfluidic electrophoresis system according to the manufacturer's specifications.\nSubscription Required.
