    "The procedure consists of the dual radioactive and fluorescent labeling of nanoparticles, in vivo PET-CT imaging, ex vivo biodistribution measurements, and ex vivo immunostaining and flow cytometry analyses. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n1. Preparation of Dual-labeled Liposomes\nNOTE: Syngeneic B16 melanoma tumors can be induced by injecting 300,000 B16-F10 cells into the back flanks of C57BL/6 mice under anesthesia from inhaling 2%-isoflurane-containing oxygen. Use sterile reagents and tools in a sterile workspace during surgery. After surgery, carefully observe the animals until their recovery from anesthesia. Put the animals back in their cages only when they regain full consciousness and mobility. House them in sterile rooms for animals with xenografted tumors. Tumors with a size of 300 mm 3 are ideal for nanoparticle characterization due to their pronounced enhanced permeability and retention effects (EPR), which can increase nanoparticle accumulation. The detailed protocols are provided below.\nIn a round-bottom flask, dissolve a mixture of 20 mg of lipids in 2 mL of chloroform containing 1,2-dipalmitoyl- sn-glycero-3-phophocholine (DPPC), cholesterol, 1,2-disearoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol)2000 (DSPE-PEG2000), DSPE-deferoxamine (DSPE-DFO) 8, and 1,1-diododecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine-5,5-disulfonic acid (DiIC12[5]-DS) at molar ratios of 61.3%, 33.4%, 5, 0.2%, and 0.1%, respectively.\n\tNOTE: This lipid composition is very similar to the liposomal formulation of doxorubicin currently used in the clinic 2. The resulting liposomes from our procedure will closely mimic the in vivo performance of the clinical nanomedicine.\nUse a rotary evaporator to remove the organic solvent and form a thin lipid film at room temperature. Add 20 mL of PBS and sonicate for 30 min to generate liposomal nanoparticles by using a 3.8-mm sonication tip and an amplitude of 30 W, with sufficient cooling on ice.",
    "Centrifuge the liposome solution at 4,000 x g for 10 min to remove the aggregates and wash the nanoparticles with PBS using centrifugal filtration (molecular weight cut-off (MWCO: 100 kDa) to remove free lipids and residual organic solvent. Concentrate the liposomes, which will remain in the top chamber, and transfer them to a new tube. The liposomes can be stored in a fridge in PBS for up to 1 week before the subsequent steps.\nFor quality control, characterize the liposomes by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Specifically, mix 50 µL of liposomes with 950 µL of PBS, and then transfer the mixture into the sizing cuvette. Place the cuvette in the analyzer and measure the particle sizes and their size distribution. The particle sizes and their size distribution (polydispersity index (PDI)) are expected to be 90 - 120 nm and 0.1 - 0.2, respectively.\nFor radiolabeling, mix the purified liposomes, equivalent to 2 mg of lipids, in PBS at a pH between 6.9 and 7.1 with 1 mCi 89Zr-oxalate at 37 °C for 2 h in a 1.5-mL tube, (total volume: ~ 100 µL). Remove the free, unreacted 89Zr by centrifugal filtration (MWCO = 100 kDa), similar to step 1.3. Wash the retentate with sterile PBS and dilute it to the desired volume. The radiochemical yield should be 80 - 95%.\nCAUTION! Working with radioactive materials is highly regulated. Institutions must be certificated and provide the necessary facilities, personnel training, and strict monitoring of radioactivity use. Researchers need to receive adequate training and wear personal protective equipment and dosimetry rings/badges when handling radioactivity.\nDetermine the radiochemical purity of the radiolabeled liposomes by size exclusion radio-HPLC, which typically should be over 98% 10. Radiochemical purities lower than 95% are indicative of insufficient washing on step 1.5.",
    "After radiolabeling, determine the size of the nanoparticles by dynamic light scattering. The size and PDI are expected to be within the same range as the measurements in step 1.4 10.\n\tNOTE: If radioactive samples are not allowed in the flow cytometer or fluorescence microscope, non-radioactive natZr-oxalate can be used to label liposomes in step 1.5. These non-radioactive liposomes have identical characteristics to their radioactive analogs. A depiction of this procedure is provided in Figure 2.\n2.  In Vivo PET-CT Imaging and Biodistribution of Dual-labeled Liposomes\nInject about 100 µL of dual-labeled liposomes with about 300 µCi of radioactivity into restrained melanoma mice (C57BL/6, female, 10 - 16 weeks old) through their tail veins, at about 10 mCi 89Zr/kg body weight.\nTo determine the half-life, draw blood from the tail vein from anesthetized animals under 2% isoflurane-containing oxygen using 28-G insulin syringes. Collect the blood (10 - 20 µL) in pre-weighed tubes at 2 min, 15 min, 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, and 48 h after injection. Weigh the blood by difference, determine radioactivity content using a gamma counter, and calculate radioactivity concentration as percentage of injected dose per gram (%ID/g).\n\tNOTE: Perform the procedure in a room equipped with an anesthesia system, recovery cages, heating, and a biohazard hood. Make sure that the animals fully recover and gain normal mobility after the procedure before transferring them from recovery cages to holding cages. House the tumor-bearing animals in rooms designated for animals administered with radioactive materials.",
    "24 or 48 h after the injection of the  liposomes, image the mice in a small-animal MicroPET-CT scanner 10. Place the anesthetized animal horizontally on its belly and keep it anesthetized. Administer 2% isoflurane-oxygen through a nose cone. Apply ophthalmic ointment to its eyes before the scan to prevent them from drying.\nPerform a whole-body PET static scan recording at least 50 million coincident events, with an approximate duration of 15 min. Set the energy and coincidence timing window at 350-700 keV and 6 ns, respectively. Afterwards, perform a 5-min computed tomography (CT) scan. Set the X-ray tube to a voltage of 80 kV and a current of 500 µA; the CT scan uses 120 rotational steps for a total of 220 degrees, with approximately 145 ms per frame 10.\nAfter the PET-CT scan, immediately sacrifice the mice by carbon dioxide asphyxiation and confirm the deaths by pinching the paws of the animals. Once confirmed, perform cervical dislocations.\nRemove the blood in mouse tissues by first cutting open the right atrium and then injecting 20 mL PBS into the left ventricle, and subsequently collect the relevant tissues such as tumor, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle, and others 16.\nWeigh the tissues, measure their radioactivity content by gamma counting 8 , 9, and calculate the tissue radioactivity accumulation as a percentage of the injected dose per g (%ID/g).\n3. Ex Vivo Flow Cytometry and Immunostaining\nNOTE: Inject about 100 µL of fluorescent liposomes into melanoma mice through their tail vein at a dose of 0.5 mg of dye per kg of body weight. If radioactive samples are not allowed in the flow cytometer and fluorescence microscope, non-radioactive liposomes must be used.",
    "Sacrifice the mice 24 h post injection, as in step 2.5, and collect the tumors, which must be stored in cold PBS.\nFor flow cytometry, follow these steps 17:\n\t\nPrepare an enzyme cocktail consisting of a mixture of purified collagenase I and II (4 U/mL), hyaluronidase (60 U/mL), and DNase I (60 U/mL) in flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA and 1 mM EDTA).\nMix 100 mg of tumor tissue with 200 µL of enzyme cocktail buffer in a 1.5-mL tube and dice the tissue to small pieces with fine scissors. Add another 1.3 mL of enzyme cocktail into the tube and transfer its contents to a 6-well plate.\nShake the 6-well plate on a horizontal shaker placed inside a 37 °C oven for 60 min at 60 rpm.\nWash the tissue homogenate with flow cytometry buffer 3 times to obtain a single cell suspension.\nStain the cells with a cocktail of antibodies specific to biomarkers including CD45, CD11b, Ly6C, CD11c, CD64, CD3, MHCII, and CD31 (1:200 dilution for all antibodies; clone information is provided in the materials spreadsheet). Identify relevant cell types and determine their mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of DiIC12(5)-DS in each cell population with an appropriate flow cytometry analysis software.\nFor immunostaining, follow these steps:\n\t\nPlace a tumor into a cassette filled with optimal cutting medium (OCT) and freeze it on dry ice.\nMake 6-µm frozen sections from tumor tissue and place them on histology glass slides; the sections should cover the largest cross-sections of the tumor, which provide the most representative information on the tissue.",
    "Stain the biomarkers ( e.g., CD31 for endothelial cells) of interest with the corresponding antibodies ( e.g., anti-CD31, clone MEC13.3). Fix the sections with paraformaldehyde; block them with serum matching the species origin of the secondary antibodies; incubate with primary antibodies for 12 h at 4 °C and then with secondary antibodies for 2 h; and finally, wash with PBS and cover with cover slips. Image the stained slides with a Leica upright confocal SP5 microscope 13 , 16.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
