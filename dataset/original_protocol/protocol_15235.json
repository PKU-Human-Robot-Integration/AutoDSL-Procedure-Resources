    "1. Prepare Cannula\nWarm a 1-inch long section of PE10 tubing with your fingertips and stretch it so that the tubing becomes thin.\nNote: the size of the vessel or duct to be cannulated will determine the degree of stretching required. The cannula must be well-stretched for bile duct casts but may only be required to be moderately stretched to fit within the larger portal vein.\nCut the stretched tubing at a diagonal to generate a beveled tip.\nCut the other edge of the tubing to create a 5-6 inch segment.\nInsert a 32 gauge, ½ inch hypodermic needle into the non-beveled edge of the tubing.\n2. Prepare Syringe with PBS\nFill a 3 ml syringe with PBS.\nScrew the syringe onto the hypodermic needle with attached pulled PE10 tubing previously prepared.\nFlick syringe and push syringe plunger to ensure that PBS has filled the needle and tubing and there are no air bubbles in the syringe.\nPlace the prepared syringe with PBS into a syringe-holder shaped out of modeling clay. This holder will keep the syringe steady while the tubing is inserted into the duct.\n3. Other Set-up\nWeigh 0.1 g of catalyst into a small container, e.g., one well of a 24-well plate.\nPull 1 ml resin into a 3 ml syringe.\nNote: relative amounts of catalyst and resin may be adjusted to alter curing time. Decreasing amount of catalyst may, however, increase cast shrinkage and lead to a less desirable cast.\n Note: when handling resin, take precautions to avoid contact with resin or inhalation of the resin fumes. Always wear gloves and perform steps involving resin in a well-ventilated area, such as a chemical fume hood\nCut a piece of 5.0 silk suture of approximately 5 inches to be used as a ligature.\n4. Prepare Mouse",
    "Sacrifice adult mouse. Lay mouse on its back and open up the abdominal cavity.\nLay mouse on dissecting scope platform. Position a 15 ml conical tube perpendicularly underneath the mouse to increase visibility and accessibility to liver.\nWet a cotton swab with PBS and use it to flip the liver upwards and away from you to expose the dorsal view of the liver along with the extrahepatic portal vein or common bile duct.\nFor portal vein casts, you can prevent blood clotting by flushing the vein with room temperature PBS. Attach a needle to a 3 ml syringe filled with PBS and insert needle into extrahepatic portal vein as far from the liver as you can. Gently push PBS through into the portal vein. Make a nick in the common cardinal vein to drain blood. Use a wet cotton swab to massage liver, enhancing blood drainage. This step is not recommended for the bile duct and may not be necessary for all vascular systems.\nNote: this step can also be performed with 4% paraformaldehyde instead of PBS. Use of 4% paraformaldehyde may increase vascular integrity and result in a more precise cast, specifically of smaller vascular structures.\n5. Cannulate Extrahepatic Portal vein or Common Bile Duct\nUse curved forceps to pass the surgical suture ligature underneath the portal vein or bile duct, approximately ¼ inch from the liver.\nTie the suture into a loose common knot. DO NOT tighten the knot.",
    "If you are working with an open-ended system, it may be helpful to tie and tighten a ligature at the other end of the system. If you have opened the common cardinal vein to drain the blood from the portal vein, tie a ligature around it to increase pressure within the portal vein and prevent resin leakage into the central hepatic vein.\nUse spring scissors to make a small cut in the portal vein or bile duct, approximately ¼ inch below the suture knot. This cut should penetrate no more than halfway through the diameter of the portal vein or bile duct.\nUsing #5 forceps, hold the portal vein or bile duct at the site of the cut and insert beveled end of the tubing into the bile duct.\nPush tip of tubing past the pre-tied ligature and towards the liver.\nTest for cannulation accuracy by injecting PBS through the cannula and watching to see if it enters the portal vein or bile duct.\nTighten the ligature to hold the cannula in place.\n6. Resin Cast the Portal Vein or Intrahepatic Bile Duct\nAdd pre-measured 1 ml resin to pre-measured 0.1 g catalyst and mix thoroughly. Avoid generating air bubbles.\nDraw resin-catalyst mixture back into the 3 ml syringe. Remove any air bubbles by gently flicking the syringe and expelling bubbles.\nNote: for casting small structures, it may be helpful to use a vacuum chamber to remove very small air bubbles from the resin and enhance cast quality. To allow for time to perform this step, it will be necessary to decrease the catalyst/resin ratio from that suggested above in order to slow resin curing.\nCarefully replace PBS-containing syringe with resin-containing syringe, leaving the 32 gauge needle attached to the cannula.",
    "Slowly and gently push resin into the portal vein or bile duct until resistance increases and liver is filled.\nUse wet cotton swab to gently massage liver and encourage an even fill.\nRemove cannula from the structure and quickly re-tighten the ligature to prevent resin leakage.\nAllow mouse to lay flat at room temperature for 20 min while the resin cures, then remove liver.\nProceed with either clearing or macerating the liver.\n7. Clear Liver for Visualization in situ\nFix the liver in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, rocking.\nWash the liver in PBS for at least four hr, rocking. At this point, you may separate the liver lobes if desired.\nDehydrate in 50% methanol and then in 100% methanol for at least four hr each, rocking at room temperature.\nClear the liver in a 1:2 solution of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate (BABB) for at least 24 hr, rocking. Longer wash times may be needed. If the liver does not clear completely after 2-3 days, move back to 100% methanol for 24 hr and repeat BABB clearing.\nSubmerge liver in BABB in a glass Petri dish for imaging in situ.\n8. Macerate Liver Tissue\nRemove liver from mouse and put into a 50 ml conical tube with water. Wait 1 hr for complete resin curing. Separate liver lobes if desired.\nPour off water and move liver to a glass bottle. Submerge in 15% KOH. Leave overnight at room temperature. Do not rock.\nCarefully pour off KOH and wash cast in distilled water. Note: the cast is very fragile and should be handled with extreme care. Avoid disrupting the cast when adding or removing fluid from the tube.\nWhen resin cast is clean, gently lay on a Kimwipe to dry, then transfer to a container to be stored.",
    "9. Representative Results\nA successful cast of the portal vein or bile duct will show a continuous network of progressively smaller branches extending from the hilum to the liver periphery.\nFigure 1 shows a portal vein cast as visualized in situ after BABB clearing. Figure 1A shows the cast of the entire left liver lobe and the shape and size of the cast. Figure 1B shows a close-up view of the same cast, demonstrating the penetration of the resin into the smallest portal vein branches at the liver periphery.\nFigure 2 shows a portal vein cast that has undergone KOH maceration. Figure 2A shows the entire left liver lobe and Figure 2B is a close up of the small peripheral branches.\nThis technique has also been successfully applied to the intrahepatic bile duct and published using both the BABB clearing and KOH maceration techniques1,2,7.\nCommon problems include incomplete fills, bubbles in the resin, and overflow into surrounding systems or tissues. Figure 3 demonstrates how to recognize an incomplete fill (Figure 3A), bubbles (Figure 3A), and an overflow of resin from the portal vein to the central vein (Figure 3B).\nAll images are taken using a Leica MZ 16 FA stereoscope and QImaging RETIGA 4000R camera.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4272/4272fig1.jpg\n Figure 1.  BABB-cleared resin cast of hepatic left lobe portal vein. A. Resin cast shows a hierarchical branching structure extending from the hilum to the liver periphery. Resin cast appears in yellow color within blue-tinted liver lobe. B. A close up shows that resin fill extends to small branches in the liver periphery. Resin is whitish through cleared liver.

    "Figure 2.  Tissue-macerated resin cast of hepatic left lobe portal vein. A. Resin cast of whole liver lobe shows many branches of varying sizes. B. Close-up shows small branches in periphery of liver. Feathering appearance of small branches represents resin filling of sinusoidal spaces and may or may not be visible on resin casts and will increase the apparent branch density if present. Resin is white in color. Scale bar = 1 mm.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4272/4272fig3.jpg\n Figure 3.  Common problems with resin casts. A. An incomplete fill of the left lobe portal vein is apparent by some or all cast branches failing to extend to the liver periphery. This cast also displays bubbles, visible as breaks in the continuous cast (arrow). B. Due to the proximity of the portal vein and central vein branches in some places, the portal vein resin will often enter and fill the central vein. This can be recognized when there are two distinct hilar branches (arrows) and two branching structures that have different patterns and overlap. Discriminating between technical errors and true morphological alterations can be done in two ways. First, the cast structure should be compared to the structure expected based on 2-dimensional analysis or other methods. Second, it is important to perform several replicates, and when possible, quantify the structure and perform statistical analysis to determine reproducibility and if there is a statistically significant morphological alteration between and within different experimental and control arms.Subscription Required.
