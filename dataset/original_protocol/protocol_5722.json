Auto injector setup showing the injector (A), linked to the catheter through extension tubing (B, C), and the setup before the subject is moved into the MRI for scanning (D).Set up the subject in the MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil.Perform cranial MRI as following sequences, a quoted method from Absinta et al. (2017).Whole-brain T1-Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition of Gradient Echoes (MPRAGE, sagittal 3D turbo-fast low angle shot sequence, acquisition matrix 256 x 256, isotropic resolution 1 mm, 176 slices, repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE]/inversion time [TI] = 3,000/3/900 msec, flip angle 9°, acquisition time 5 min 38 sec).Limited T2-weighted Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR, coronal 2D acquisition over the superior sagittal sinus, field-of-view 256 mm2, 22 slices, reconstructed in-plane resolution 0.25 mm2, 42 contiguous 3 mm slices, TR/TE/TI = 6,500/93/2,100 msec, echo train length 17, bandwidth 80 Hz/pixel, acquisition time 5 min), optimized for detection of gadolinium-based contrast agent in the subarachnoid space.Black-blood scan (coronal acquisition, Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolution [SPACE] sequence, field-of-view 174 mm2, matrix 320 x 320, reconstructed in-plane resolution 0.27 mm2, 64 contiguous 0.5 mm sections, TR/TE = 938/22 msec, echo train length 35, bandwidth 434 Hz/pixel, acquisition time 7 min 50 sec). Acquire a series of 2 or three overlapping coronal acquisitions to cover most of the cerebral hemispheres.Whole-brain T2-FLAIR scan (coronal 3D SPACE sequence, field-of-view 235 mm2, matrix 512 x 512, reconstructed in-plane resolution 0.",
    "46 mm2, 176 1 mm sections, TR/TE/TI = 4,800/354/1,800 msec, nonselective inversion pulse, echo-train length 298, bandwidth 780 Hz/pixel, acceleration factor 2, acquisition time 14 min).Whole-brain T1-SPACE (axial 3D acquisition, acquisition matrix 256 x 256, isotropic resolution 0.9 mm, 112 sections, TR/TE = 600/20 msec, flip angle 120°, echo-train length 28, acquisition time 10 min).Inject MRI contrast agent, either gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg body weight, i.v., Bayer HealthCare) or another standard agent, at a rate of 0.3 ml/min followed by 10 ml of saline flush.Repeat MRI sequences A3a, A3c, and A3d after completion of the infusion.Covert scanner-generated DICOM images into NIFTI files for processing using dcm2nii script (nitrc.org[href=https://www.nitrc.org/], open source). Co-register pre- and post-contrast images, perform skull-stripping, and subtract pre-contrast images from post-contrast images using standard algorithms implemented in MIPAV software (select Algorithms/Registration/Optimized Automatic Registration and Utilities/Image Calculator/Subtract, respectively). Import subtraction images into OsiriX software for maximum intensity projection (MIP) 3D rendering (select 2D/3D and then 3D Surface Rendering).

On post-gadobutrol coronal T2-FLAIR, the dura does not enhance, and lymphatic vessels (red arrows), running alongside the venous dural sinuses and within the falx cerebri, can be appreciated. 3D rendering, using OsiriX software, of putative dural lymphatics (black) in a 47-year old woman, derived from whole-brain T1-weighted SPACE MRI. (Modified from Figure 1 and Figure S1 in Absinta et al. [2017]. Creative Commons Attribution License[href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/])For more specific lymphatic imaging, perform Steps B1-B8 using gadofosveset (0.03 mmol/kg body weight, i.v., Lantheus Medical Imaging) rather than gadobutrol. Compare the subtraction images obtained from gadofovest and gadobutrol experiments to identify the lymphatic vessels (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180417/20180417204142_6873.jpgFigure 3. Gadobutrol vs. gadofosveset in MRI visualization of dural lymphatic vessels.",
    "Coronal T1-weighted black-blood images were acquired after intravenous injection of two different gadolinium-based contrast agents during two MRI sessions separated by one week. Dural lymphatics (red arrows in magnified view boxes) were better discerned using gadobutrol (standard MRI contrast agent, which readily enters the dura) compared to gadofosveset (serum albumin-binding contrast agent, which remains largely intravascular) and were localized around dural sinuses, middle meningeal artery, and cribriform plate (white arrows). Notably, the choroid plexus (white arrows) enhanced less with gadofosveset than gadobutrol, whereas meningeal and parenchymal blood vessels (both veins and arteries) did not enhance with any contrast agent and appeared black. (Originally published in Absinta et al.

Commercial 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) contains a small percentage of methanol as a stabilizer, which is not a problem for the majority of procedures. Dura should be fixed as soon as possible using gentle agitation (swirling) of the specimen to aid penetration and fixation reaction. Tissue should be fixed for 24-48 h in NBF, and then stored in 1x PBS with a few drops of 10% formalin at room temperature. Trim the dura into coronal sections and embed the tissue in a paraffin block (see Figure 4). Our recommendation is to focus on the coronal sections near the superior sagittal sinus, which can be easily identified in the dura.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180417/20180417204603_8069.jpgFigure 4. Whole-mount and coronal sections of the human dura mater for histological analysis. A. The red dotted line shows the sampling direction. B, C, and D. Show the coronal view of the dura mater sample before tissue processing. Using rotary microtome, cut the paraffin-embedded tissue block into sections of 3-8 µm thickness.",
    "Float the sections in 20% ethanol at room temperature, then transfer them to a 44 °C water bath. (see Note 1 and Video 1)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Demonstration of the sectioning of the human dura mater using a microtome. Before sectioning, place the paraffin tissue block surface on melting ice or cold wet paper towel. After sectioning, place the section in 20% ethanol and then into a warm floating bath.Transfer the sections onto Superfrost Plus Microslides, as uncoated or uncharged slides may not retain the tissue. Before drying out the slides, remove residual water using a snap of the wrist (imagine wielding a whip), which is important to prevent sections from lifting from slides. Allow the slides to dry vertically overnight, at room temperature, to allow trapped water to escape downward.Deparaffinize slides using xylene (3 changes of xylene, each 3 min).Rehydrate slides using 100% alcohol (3 changes, each 3 min), 80% alcohol (3 min) and 50% alcohols (3 min), respectively.Rinse slides in deionized water for 1 min. Perform heat-induced antigen retrieval to unmask the antigenic epitope using a steamer. Add tap water to the water base, to the “Max” line, and put the steaming plate onto the water reservoir. Fill a plastic Coplin jar with Target Retrieval Solution or Target Retrieval Solution, at pH 9, and dip deparaffinized/rehydrated slides in the jar. Place the plastic Coplin jar in the steamer and cover it. Turn on the steamer and set the timer for 20 min to incubate it at 95-100 °C. We recommend steamer for heat-induced antigen retrieval instead of microwave or pressure cooker, because it reduces the chance of the section falling off the slide. Take out the Coplin jar and allow it to cool down for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Rinse slides gently in Tris-buffed saline (TBS) for 5 min. Use TBS or TBS-0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) during slide washing to prevent sections from falling off.Immerse sections in 0.3% H2O2 solution in deionized water at room temperature for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity.Rinse slides gently in TBST for 1 min.Draw the hydrophobic barrier around the tissues using PAP pen.Rinse slides gently in TBST 20 for 1 min. Drop 3-4 of Dako Protein Block on the tissue and incubate at room temperature for 20 min in a humidified chamber.Gently drop off the excess Dako Protein Block from the slides. Do not rinse the slides in this step.Apply primary antibody + Dako Antibody Diluent (see Table 1 for antibody dilution factor; 100-200 µl is required to cover the tissue) on the tissues, and incubate at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight in a humidified chamber. Make sure that the antibody is spread well on the tissues.Table 1. Condition of antigen retrieval, antibody dilution and time of incubationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180418/20180418002513_3464.jpgWash slides in TBST 3 times, 5 min each, using a rocker. Apply secondary antibody (HRP anti-Mouse IgG or HRP anti-rabbit IgG) on the tissues and incubate for 30 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber.Wash slides in TBST 3 times, 5 min each, using a rocker. Drip 3-4 drops of freshly made DAB substrate solution on the slide and check the brown color of antibody signal by microscopy.If the staining reveals adequate intensity, stop the DAB reaction by dipping slides in deionized water. Over-staining will lead to high background that will obscure the true signals.Dip slides in Leica Hematoxylin 560 MX for 10 sec, for better morphology and contrast.Rinse slides in tap water for 5 min.Immerse slides in bluing solution (Leica Blue buffer or 0.",
    "2% ammonia solution or 0.1% lithium carbonate solution).Dehydrate slides through air dry and coverslip using Permount mounting solution. The mounted slides can be kept at room temperature constantly. Immunohistochemistry, double staining of D2-40 and CD31 (simultaneous double staining of lymphatic and blood vessels, respectively)Follow Steps C5-C16 above.Apply cocktails of primary antibodies + Dako Antibody Diluent on the tissues and incubate at room temperature for 2 h in a humidified chamber.Wash slides in TBST 3 times, 5 min each, using a rocker. Apply secondary antibody (HRP anti-Mouse IgG for D2-40 and ImmPRESSTM-AP anti-Rabbit IgG for CD31) on the tissues and incubate for 30 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber.Wash slides in TBST 3 times, 5 min each, using a rocker. Drip 3-4 drops of freshly made DAB substrate solution on the slide and check the brown color of D2-40 antibody signal by microscopy. Wash slides in deionized water to stop the DAB reaction.Drip 3-4 drops of fresh Vector Blue substrate solution on the same slide and check the blue color of CD-31 antibody signal by microscopy.If the staining reveals enough intensity, stop the Vector Blue reaction by dipping slides in deionized water. CAUTION: Do NOT perform hematoxylin counterstaining following use of the Vector Blue chromogen.Dehydrate slides through air dry and coverslip using Permount mounting solution.Immunohistochemistry, double staining of PROX1 and CD31 (sequential double staining)Follow Steps C5-C22 above. Finish PROX1 immunostaining without counterstaining. Drip 3-4 drops of Dako Protein Block on the tissue and incubate at room temperature for 20 min in a humidified chamber.Gently drop off the excess Dako Protein Block from the slides. Do not rinse the slides in this step.Apply CD31 antibodies + Dako Antibody Diluent on the tissues and incubate at room temperature for 2 h in a humidified chamber.",
