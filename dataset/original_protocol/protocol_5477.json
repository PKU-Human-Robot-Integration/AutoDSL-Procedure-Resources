    "Construct TriFC vectors by LR reactions (Gateway) with your entry clones (RNA, RNA-BP, and MCP) following the manufacturer’s instruction; LR reaction MCP and RNA-BP entry clones with Gateway BiFC vectors (pBA3130, 3132, 3134, and 3136; Figures 1A and 1B) (Seo et al., 2017). LR reaction RNA entry clones with Gateway MS2 tagging vectors (pBA-6xMS2-GW or pBA-GW-6xMS2; Figure 1C) (Schonberger et al., 2012). In this study, we used pENTR-ELENA1 for RNA entry clone, pENTR-MED19a for RNA-BP entry clone, and pENTR-MCP for MCP entry clone.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171015/20171015231236_3578.jpg Figure 1.

Transform 50 µl Agrobacterium competent cells (1010 cfu/ml) with each DNA construct (50 ng) (3 different vectors; Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C) by heat shock method (Höfgen and Willmitzer, 1988).   Spread the cells on the LB/spectinomycin agar media (see Recipes) and grow for 2 days in an incubator at 28-30 °C.   Inoculate one single colony of Agrobacterium in 5 ml LB with appropriate antibiotics (see Recipes). Grow overnight in a shaking incubator with 200 rpm at 28-30 °C.   Use 250 μl of the overnight culture to inoculate 10 ml LB-MES (pH 5.6) (see Recipes) (with same antibiotics) plus 4 μl of 100 mM acetosyringone (see Recipes) and grow overnight in the shaking incubator with 200 rpm at 28-30 °C.   Measure the A600 of overnight cultures (OD = 0.8-1.0).    Collect bacterial cells (4,000 x g, 10 min) at room temperature and resuspend the pellet in resuspension solution (see Recipes). Adjust the final A600 to 0.4.",
    "Leave on a bench (room temperature) for over 4 h (or overnight) before infiltration.   Transfer 1 ml of each Agrobacterium cell suspension into a 10 ml tube and mix well (Figure 2A).   Perform the infiltration with a 1 ml syringe. Simple press the syringe (no needle) on the underside of a leaf (Note: Avoid cotyledons.), and exert a counter-pressure with finger on the other side. Successful infiltration is often observed as a spreading of ‘wetting’ area in the leaf and label the infiltrated region. (Figure 2B).   Observe the YFP signals under a confocal laser scanning microscope 2-3 days after infiltration (Figure 2C). Excitation wavelength is 514 nm and detection rage of emission wavelength is 520-550 nm.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171015/20171015231524_6321.jpg Figure 2. Transient expression for TriFC assay in N. benthamiana. A. Mix three different Agrobacterium suspensions. 1 carries the RNA-BP construct (Figure 1A), 2 carries the MCP construct (Figure 1B), and 3 carries the MS2 tagged RNA construct (Figure 1C). B.
