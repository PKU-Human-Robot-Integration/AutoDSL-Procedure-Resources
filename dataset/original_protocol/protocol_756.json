  "procedures": [
    "1. Thaw samples on ice.\n  2. Add 500 µL PBS to the AU-0.5 filter, cap, and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 14,000 x g.\n  3. Reverse the device and centrifuge for 2 minutes at 1000 x g to remove the residual PBS.\n  4. Aspirate PBS from the collection tube.\n  5. Transfer 500 µL of sample to the AU-0.5 filter and cap the device.\n  6. Centrifuge for 30 minutes at 14,000 x g. There should be ~15 µL sample remaining in the upper chamber.\n  7. Remove device from the centrifuge and empty the collection tube.  \n  8. Add 500 µL PBS to the filter device and gently pipette sample multiple times to mix. \n  9. Centrifuge for 30 minutes at 14,000 x g.\n  10. Place filter upside down in a fresh microcentrifuge tube.\n  11. Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 2000 x g<sup>1</sup> to transfer the sample to the tube.\n  12. Isolate RNA using the miRNeasy Micro kit."
