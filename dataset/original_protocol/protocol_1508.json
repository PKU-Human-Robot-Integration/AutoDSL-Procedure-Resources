    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPrepare Surface Antibody Master Mix and Labeling\nTiming: ≈2 h (for 80 samples)\nWe recommend performing these experiment setup steps the day before staining due to the length of the protocol, the longest step being antibody master mix preparation. Here, we stain 36 experimental samples with two mass cytometry panels.\nLocate and set aside sample vials in liquid nitrogen, for quick retrieval on the day of staining\nMake surface antibody master mixes, diluting in CyFACS (Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]), and store at 4°C\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_105_6.csv\nTitrated antibodies of the adaptive immune response focused mass cytometry panel and dilution factors to make master mixes. Vendor listed as “CIO” refers to Center for Immuno-Oncology and indicates the antibody metal conjugation was performed in our lab.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_105_7.csv\nTitrated antibodies of the innate immune response focused mass cytometry panel and dilution factors to make master mixes. Vendor listed as “CIO” refers to Center for Immuno-Oncology and indicates the antibody metal conjugation was performed in our lab.\nLabel cell-counting slides and 15 mL conical tubes with sample identifier, one each per sample\nFill 15 mL conical tubes with 12 mL of supplemented RPMI and put in 4°C\nOptional: The surface master mix preparation and labeling can be performed prior to PBMC Sample Thawing and Staining Preparation, though the workflow on the thawing and staining day will become more laborious and time consuming. Therefore, it is recommended to perform this section of the protocol the day before staining.\nOptional: Antibody surface master mixes can be stored at -80°C without observable differences (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Other groups have shown that a large batch of premixed antibody master mix can be made and stored at -80°C for at least 9 months (Schulz et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/105-Fig3.jpg",
    "Figure 3. Comparing Storage Conditions of Surface Master Mix\nMetal-conjugated antibody surface master mixes were prepared and stored at -80°C or 4°C for 16 h and healthy donor PBMCs were stained. Clones and metals are the same as used in the adaptive and innate panels, as listed in Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\nNote: Dilution Factors listed in Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] are specific to human cryopreserved PBMCs. All researchers using this protocol should titrate antibodies on their sample type of interest and can use these dilution values as guides. Antibody dilutions are estimated at 6 μg/mL for a 1:100 dilution factor\nNote: Commercially purchased antibodies listed here do not need to be re-titrated between lots.\nCritical: In-house conjugated antibodies must be titrated for every new conjugation lot.\nPBMC Sample Thawing and Staining Preparation\nTiming: ≈2 h (for 80 samples)\nThis step details an optimized thawing protocol for PBMC samples from liquid nitrogen storage to achieve high (>95%) viability and concentrates the samples appropriately for the next steps (Holland et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPlace 15 mL conical tubes (filled with supplemented RPMI) in the water bath\nPrepare a liquid waste container with ≈5 mL of 10% bleach\nFill two large ice buckets with ice\nThaw each sample vial one at a time in a water bath set at 37°C for ≈45 s (for a sample volume of 1 mL) until just melted\nQuickly pipette contents of the vial into the appropriate, prelabeled 15 mL conical tube\nIf multiple vials of reference sample are used, these can be combined into a single 15 mL conical tube, taking care to not overfill it\nCount cells and record viability and total cell/mL\nMix 15 μL of cell suspension with 15 μL of trypan blue for a 1:1 mixture",
    "Load 20 μL of 1:1 mixture onto cell counting slide\nInsert cell counting slide into Cellometer and count\nCentrifuge all samples (757 × g, 3 min, 4°C)\nKeep samples on ice after they are finished spinning\nCalculate how much volume is needed to resuspend all samples to 5 million cells/mL\nCritical: Ensure that there is enough reference sample after counting: approximately 20 million of each ex vivo and stimulated reference sample are needed for an 80-sample experiment. 2 million cells are needed from each of the reference sample stimulation conditions (ex vivo and stimulated) to run as separate solo wells (1 solo well for each stimulation condition per barcode set; 4 barcode sets are needed for 80 samples). 0.5 million of 1:1 ex vivo and stimulated mixed reference sample is spiked into each experimental sample (80 experimental samples = 40 million cells of 1:1 mixed reference sample).\nViability Stain and CD45 Barcoded Reference Sample Spike-in\nTiming: ≈1 h (for 80 samples)\nAt the end of this step the experimental samples and reference sample will be stained for viability, using Rhodium-103 (103Rh), barcoded with CD45, and plated in a 96-well v-bottom plate. The experimental sample and reference sample are stained with CD45 conjugated to different metal isotopes: experimental samples with CD45 conjugated to 141Pr (CD45_141Pr) and reference sample stained with CD45 conjugated to 89Y (CD45_89Y). This CD45 barcoding step allows the reference sample to be spiked-in to the experimental samples and provides a quality control. Experimental sample in our lab is typically a cryopreserved PBMC clinical trial patient sample. Reference sample is a 1:1 mixed sample from a single donor of resting PBMCs (“ex vivo”) and stimulated PBMCs (“stim”). As an additional quality control, the ex vivo and stim reference samples are also stained as independent samples on the plate.",
    "Make a master mix of 103Rh and RPMI with 103Rh diluted to a final concentration of 1:500\nUse calculated volume (from step 13) to determine how much 103Rh + RPMI master mix is needed and round up ≈20% for overhead\nDecant supernatant from reference sample conical tubes\nAdd the appropriate volume of 103Rh-RPMI master mix to the reference sample for a final cell concentration of 5 million cells/mL\nPipette up and down to disrupt the cell pellet\nAdd CD45_89Y at a 1:200 dilution to reference sample suspended in 103Rh-RPMI\nAdd CD45_141Pr at a dilution of 1:1000 to remaining 103Rh-Media\nDecant supernatant from experimental samples and add appropriate volume of CD45_141Pr-103Rh-Media to experimental samples to resuspend each to 5 million cells/mL\nSee step 13 for calculated volumes\nIncubate samples for 15 min at 37˚C in the water bath\nAfter CD45-barcoding and viability incubation is finished, immediately bring volume in each conical tube up to 10 mL with CyFACS and centrifuge: 757 × g, 3 min, 4°C\nDecant supernatant, resuspend cell pellet in 10 mL CyFACS by gently pipetting up and down, and centrifuge samples: 757 × g, 3 min, 4°C.\nIf residual volume remains after decanting, pipette out the remaining volume, leaving the cell pellet as dry as possible\nCalculate volume needed to resuspend cells to a concentration of 15 million cells/mL\nCalculate without factoring in any cell loss, use cell counts from step 10\nResuspend samples to 15 million cells/mL with CyFACS\nPlate experimental and reference samples in a 96-well v-bottom plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/105-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Plate Layout for Experimental Samples, Reference Samples, and CD45-Barcoded Reference Sample Spike-in",
    "(A) Experimental samples (yellow wells) and reference samples (blue) are plated. Wells C10 and F10 contain the ex vivo reference sample, and wells C11 and F11 contain the stimulated reference sample. Keeping the two stimulated conditions separate guides downstream analysis (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\n(B) 1:1 mixed reference sample is “spike-in” to experimental sample (green wells). Each well now contains 2 million cells.\nAdd 1.5 million cells (100 μL) of experimental sample to appropriate wells (yellow)\nAdd 2 million cells (133 μL) of ex vivo sample to ex vivo alone wells (blue, row 10)\nAdd 2 million cells (133 μL) of stimulated sample to stimulated alone wells (blue, row 11)\nCombine the remaining ex vivo and stimulated reference sample 1:1\nSpike-in the reference sample to experimental sample wells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B):\nAdd 0.5 million cells of 1:1 mixed reference sample (33 μL) to each experimental well (green)\nIf an experimental sample’s cell number is insufficient, then add more 1:1 mixed reference sample to reach a final cell number of 2 million total cells and a total volume of 133 μL in the well. See Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3 for more details.\nAdd 67 μL of CyFACS to each well containing sample (total 200 μL/well) and centrifuge (757 × g, 3 min, 4°C)\nNote: Each experimental sample is decanted just before being resuspended with CD45_141Pr-103Rh-Media. If multiple antibody panels are going to be used, we recommend having a separate plate for each panel.\nFcR Block and Surface Stain\nTiming: ≈1 h\nHere, the Fc receptors on the cells are blocked and the cells are stained with the surface master mix.\nPrepare FcR blocking reagent by diluting 1:10 with CyFACS\nAdd 15 μL of diluted FcR blocking reagent to each well and mix gently by pipetting\nIncubate for 10 min on ice",

After samples are plated, we recommend performing all steps with a multichannel pipette, except for adding the surface master mix.\nPalladium Mass-Tag Cell Barcoding Strategy and Fixing Samples\nTiming: 45 min\nFluidigm’s Cell-ID™ 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit stains 20 individual samples using different combinations of 6 palladium (Pd) isotopes. Here, we provide additional logistics to stain 80 samples with 4 Pd barcode sets, with ex vivo and stimulated reference samples run as separate samples in each barcode set for quality control purposes (sample barcoding strategy is outlined in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The ex vivo and stimulated reference samples are run separately, not as the 1:1 mixed reference sample, to guide manual gating (described in Expected Outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes], Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). At the end of this section, 20 samples will be combined into one 15 mL conical tube, and there will be four 15 mL conical tubes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/105-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. 20-Plex Palladium Isotope Barcode Strategy",
    "A Barcode ID # (BC #) is assigned to each sample. Each BC # is positive for 3 of the six different Palladium isotopes (102, 104, 105, 106, 108, 110 Pd). In this schema, grayed out boxes indicate that this BC # is positive for that isotope. BC 1–18 are experimental samples with reference sample spike-in, and BC 19 and 20 are reserved for reference sample controls. Downstream gating of CD45 barcoding is shown on the right to indicate what samples are in which BC #.\nPrepare reagents:\n1× Fix I Buffer\nDilute 5× Fix I Buffer with PBS to make 1× working stock of Fix I Buffer\n≈200 μL are needed per sample\n1× Barcode Perm Buffer\nDilute 10× Barcode Perm Buffer with PBS\n≈600 μL are needed per sample\n1× Perm/Wash\nDilute 10× Perm/Wash with UltraPure Water\n≈20 mL of 1× Perm/Wash per barcode batch\nAdd 200 μL of 1× Fix I to each sample and incubate for 10 min at 23°C\nThaw 4 full sets of 20 Pd-isotope barcodes for 10 min at 23°C until fully thawed\nQuickly centrifuge barcodes using the PCR tube adapter in a mini-centrifuge (≈5 s)\nCentrifuge samples: 935 × g, 3 min and decant supernatant\nResuspend cells with 200 μL of 1× Barcode Perm Buffer\nCentrifuge samples at 935 × g and decant supernatant\nRepeat wash (steps 44–45)\nResuspend cells in 100 μL of 1× Barcode Perm Buffer\nResuspend barcodes in 100 μL 1× Barcode Perm Buffer\nTransfer 100 μL of resuspended barcodes to samples\nGently mix by pipetting\nIncubate for 30 min at 23°C\nCentrifuge samples (935 x g, 3 min) and wash samples twice with 200 μL of CyFACS\nSpin samples at 935 x g for 3 min between washes\nAdd 200 μL of CyFACS to each sample",

The barcodes can be centrifuged (in step 42) in the orange plate they come in.\nCritical: Do not thaw and refreeze barcodes.\nCritical: After samples are fixed in step 40 perform all centrifugations are performed at 935 x g.\nIntracellular Stain\nTiming: 45 min\nThis step details the protocol for preparing the intracellular antibody master mix and performing the intracellular staining. If intracellular markers are not a part of the panel this entire section can be skipped.\nPrepare intracellular antibody master mixes using 1× Perm/Wash (see Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4])\nFilter intracellular antibody master mixes with a 0.1 μM spinfilter in a microcentrifuge: 14,000 × g, 5 min, 4°C\nMeasure the master mix volume after filtering and adjust to the original volume with 1× Perm/Wash\nKeep at 4°C until ready to add to samples\nAdd 100 μL of intracellular master mix to each barcode batch\nIncubate for 30 min on ice",

Store the unfiltered antibody master mix at 4°C. Filter just prior to adding the master mix to samples.\nFresh Fix and DNA Intercalator Staining\nTiming: 10 min\nAt the end of this major step, samples are fixed and stained with a DNA intercalator (Cell-ID™ Intercalator-Ir).\nPrepare a fresh batch of 2% formaldehyde fix (FA) solution\n6 mL of 2% FA is needed per barcode batch\nDilute fresh 16% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) with PBS\nVortex the cell pellet for 15 s\nAdd 5 mL of 2% FA solution to each barcode set of samples\nVortex for 30 s, thoroughly disrupting the pellet\nIncubate for 10 min at 23°C\nDuring the fresh fix incubation, thaw the DNA intercalator at RT for about 5 min, until total thawed\nAfter the 10 min Fresh Fix incubation, centrifuge samples at 935 x g for 3 min\nAdd the DNA intercalator to 2% PFA at 1:5000\nAdd 1 mL of 2% PFA + DNA intercalator to each barcode batch and resuspend cells\nCount samples for cell concentration of each barcode batch\nPipette 20 μL of cell suspension (in 2% PFA + DNA intercalator) into a cell counting slide, labeled with the respective barcoding batch\nCount (using “total concentration” assay) and record cells/mL\nPause Point: Store at 4°C until acquisition\nInstrument Tuning and Sample Acquisition\nTiming: sample acquisition: 12–24 h (across two instruments)",
    "Below, we outline the sample acquisition procedure for Helios™ Mass Cytometers that were adapted for superior data quality. The startup procedure follows the instrument manufacturer’s guidelines with a few modifications. It is important to properly tune the Helios™ prior to sample acquisition to ensure the highest possible data quality can be collected. The washing and sample acquisition procedure is a modified version of the manufacturer’s guidelines, tailored to large sample numbers with long-duration sample acquisitions.\nRetrieve samples from 4°C storage\nResuspend and transfer contents from 15 mL conical tubes into labeled 1.7 mL Microcentrifuge Tubes for washing\nCentrifuge samples for 5 min at 800 × g at 23°C\nAspirate supernatant by pipette\nAdd 1 mL Cell Staining Buffer (CSB) to each sample and pipette or vortex to resuspend\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 800 × g at 23°C\nAspirate supernatant by pipette\nAdd 1 mL Cell Acquisition Solution (CAS) to each sample and pipette or vortex to resuspend\nLabel additional 1.7 mL Microcentrifuge Tubes for each sample\nAliquot approximately 750,000 - 1 million cells from each sample into the respective additional 1.7 mL Microcentrifuge Tubes (use cell counts from step 79)\nBring total volume of each aliquot up to 1 mL in CAS\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 800 × g at 23°C\nAspirate supernatant from all Eppendorf tubes and leave pelleted at 4°C until ready to acquire\nPrepare stock of 1:5 EQ Bead/CAS mixture by combining 4 mL EQ Beads with 16 mL CAS in a 50 mL conical tube and vortex to mix\nResuspend one sample aliquot in 1 mL of EQ Bead/CAS mixture and filter through 35 μm blue filter cap into a polypropylene FACS Tube (per instrument)",
    "Acquire each sample for 7200 s, with each aliquot being acquired one at a time for approximately 30 min each\nAdjust concentration with 1:5 EQ Bead/CAS mixture if necessary, to achieve an acquisition rate of 300–350 events/s\nOnce samples have been acquired, the files are normalized, concatenated (if necessary), and debarcoded in CyTOF software\nCritical: Cell pellet must be aspirated to be as dry as possible in step 86. Samples sitting in CAS can lead to degraded signal in some channels as seen in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]. This is circumvented by reducing exposure to CAS, as mentioned, and by aliquoting samples that run for only 30–45 min at a time.\nNote: This protocol has successfully been tested on PBMC samples processed from leukoreduction apheresis product or PMBCs isolated from whole blood using Ficoll density-gradient centrifugation (Holland et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: Instrument start-up and tuning can be performed simultaneously with sample washing. For longer acquisitions, it is helpful to only wash two of the four groups of samples at first, then wash the other two groups of samples when 45 min remain of the initial sample acquisitions. Leaving the samples in the DNA-Ir step is the most stable method for those samples that will be run later.\nNote: This protocol is specific for WB injector and sample acquisition in CAS. Using this protocol, the WB injector with CAS showed superior data quality on both instruments at the Longwood Medical Area CyTOF Core compared to Fluidigm’s High Throughput (HT) injector (as shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). We have published more comprehensive results in collaboration with a multi-site comparison study to compare WB vs. HT injectors (Lee et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/105-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Comparison of Injector Type on Signal Variability as Accessed by CD45_89Y Coefficient of Variable",
    "Identical samples were acquired in replicate 100,000 events each for two different acquisition modes, Wide Bore (WB) and High Throughput (HT) injectors. The WB injector significantly decreased the variability of the CD45_89Y signal. p-value=0.0001, Welch Two Sample T-test.\nNote: The number of additional 1.7mL Microcentrifuge Tubes required for each sample is determined by the total cell count for a given sample. The goal is to reach an acquisition concentration of approximately 700,000 cells/mL which equates to a rate of 350 events/s, in a volume of 1 mL. This is to keep the run time per aliquot to ≈30 min. It minimizes the amount of background, which is seen when samples are acquired for 45 min or longer in one resuspension (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/105-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Tracking Increased Signal Drift Over Time during Long Sample Acquisitions\n(A) 89Y_CD45 positive reference cells contribute to an increase in background signal when resuspended over the course of an acquisition of at least 2 h.\n(B) Reference cells start as 141Pr_CD45 negative but contribute to increased background signal over time.\n(C) 89Y_CD45 negative cells are shown to be 141Pr_CD45 positive cells. These analyses were performed on “live, intact, single cells”, thus the increase in background signal in the 141Pr channel cannot be attributed to cell doublets."
