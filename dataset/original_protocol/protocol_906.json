    "**Restriction digest**\n1.  A total of 2 micrograms of genomic DNA is used as input into the GAPF assay.\n  2.  Split sample evenly into two 0.2 ml thin-walled PCR tubes.\n  3.  Using manufacturer's supplied buffers, digest 1 µg of genomic DNA with KpnI \\(10 U) in final volume of 20 µl. In the other tube, digest 1 µg with SbfI \\(10 U) in a final volume of 20 µl.

Incubate for 7 minutes to denature DNA.\n  4.  Remove tube from thermocycler and immediately place in ice-water bath. Incubate for 7 minutes.\n  \n**S1 digest**\n1. To sample from previous step, add 8 µl 3M NaCl, 12 µl 10x S1 nuclease buffer, 8 µl water and 1 µl S1 nuclease \\(200 U/µl). _May make master mix if performing multiple reactions._\n  **Note:** Dilute stock of S1 nuclease \\(~1000 U/µl) in Dilution buffer to obtain 200 U/µl.\n2. Incubate at 37˚C for 60 minutes.\n  \n**DNA clean-up**\n1. For most consistent results, use ChargeSwitch PCR Clean-Up Kit \\(Invitrogen) to purify DNA. _Alternatively, one may purify DNA using phenol:chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation \\(use glycogen as carrier). Resuspend DNA pellet in 84 µl 1/10 TE._\n  2.  Transfer S1 digested DNA to 1.7 ml microfuge tube.\n  3.  Add 120 μl Purification Buffer \\(N5) and mix.\n  4.

Add 150 μl of Wash Buffer.\n  10.  Pipet up and down gently to mix.\n  11.  Place sample on MagnaRack for 1 minute to pellet beads.\n  12.  Without removing tube from MagnaRack, remove and discard supernatant.\n  13.  Remove tube from MagnaRack.\n  14.  Add 150 μl of Wash Buffer.\n  15.  Pipet up and down gently to mix.\n  16.  Place sample on MagnaRack for 1 minute to pellet beads.\n  17.  Without removing tube from MagnaRack, remove and discard supernatant.\n  18.  Remove tube from MagnaRack.\n  19.  Add 84 μl of Elution Buffer \\(E5).\n  20.  Pipet up and down gently to mix.\n  21.  Incubate 1 minute.\n  22.  Place sample on MagnaRack for 1 minute to pellet beads.\n  23.  Without removing tube from MagnaRack, remove and save sample. Discard beads. A total of 80 µl will be used for next step in protocol. The leftover 4 µl can be used for PCR-based enrichment assays for quality control or troubleshooting. \n  \n_May freeze sample \\(-20˚C) at this point_\n**Ligation-mediated PCR**\n_Restriction digestion_\n1.  Using manufacturer's supplied buffers, digest 40 µl of purified DNA from previous step with MseI \\(10 U) in final volume of 50 µl, and digest the other 40 µl of purified DNA with MspI \\(40 U) in final volume of 50 µl.\n  2.  Incubate for 37˚C for 2 hours.\n  3.  Heat inactivate MseI digest by incubating at 65˚C for 20 minutes; MspI digest requires incubation at 80˚C for 20 minutes for inactivation.\n  \n_May freeze sample \\(-20˚C) at this point_\n_Linker ligation_",

Add the following to the 50 µl restriction digest from previous step: 5 µl of appropriate linker \\(MseI or MspI linker), 7 µl 10x T4 DNA Ligase buffer, 7 µl water, and 1 µl T4 DNA ligase \\(400 U/µl).\n  2.
