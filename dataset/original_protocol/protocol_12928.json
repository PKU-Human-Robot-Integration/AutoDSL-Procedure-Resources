    "1. Cell maintenance\nNOTE: A CHO-K1 cell line that stably expresses the kinin receptor from R. microplus, named BMLK3, was developed by Holmes et al.16. The details of the development of the cell line are presented elsewhere14. All the following steps are performed under sterile conditions in a class II biosafety cabinet.\nGrow the recombinant cell line in selective media (F-12K medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS] and 800 µg/mL G418 sulfate) to ensure the expression of the target receptor. Store the cells stably expressing the receptor in 1 mL of freezing medium (90% FBS and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) in a 2 mL cryovial in a −80 °C freezer.\n\tNOTE: For long-term storage of the frozen cells, store them in liquid nitrogen.\nPrewarm all the media before cell culture. In a biosafety cabinet, transfer 13 mL of prewarmed selective medium (F-12K medium containing 10% FBS and 800 µg/mL G418 sulfate) into a T-75 flask, and keep it in the biosafety cabinet. Thaw one vial of the frozen BMLK3 cells (~1.5 × 106 cells) in a 37 °C water bath for 2-3 min. Transfer the thawed cells into the T-75 flask. Maintain the cells in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 unless specified otherwise.\nWhen the cells reach 90% confluency (1-2 days), prewarm all the media to 37 °C except for Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), which is kept at room temperature. In a biosafety cabinet, remove the spent medium from the T-75 flask, wash the cells for 5 s with 10 mL of DPBS by swirling the flask gently, and then remove the DPBS with a serological pipette.\n\tNOTE: An image of CHO-K1 cells at 90% confluency is shown in Lu et al.14.",
    "Detach the cells from the T-75 flask by adding 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and incubate for 3-5 min at 37 °C in the incubator. Then, add 8 mL of selective medium, and mix well by pipetting and releasing gently 2x-3x with the same serological pipette.\nTransfer 2 mL of the cell suspension (~1 × 106 cells) from step 1.4 into a new T-75 flask containing 10 mL of warm selective medium. Grow the cells for 1-2 days in the incubator until they reach 90% confluency.\nUse the cells for the assay following the next steps, or repeat steps 1.4-1.5 once or twice before using the cells in the assay.\n\tNOTE: Do not exceed three to four passages, as the assay signal with certain cell lines may become weaker with further passages.\n2. Calcium fluorescence assay\nCoat the cell plate.\n\t\nUse a liquid handling system placed inside a biosafety cabinet for all the pipetting steps in the 384-well plates. Create custom programs for pipetting into the 384-well plates31 (Supplemental Table S1). Coat the sterile 384-well plates in advance. In a biosafety cabinet, load 10 µL/well of an aqueous solution of Poly-D-lysine (PDL) at 0.05 mg/mL into each plate, and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nEmpty the plate by quickly inverting the plate and gently blotting it on sterile paper towels. Then, rinse each well with 10 µL of water, empty the plate, and leave the plate to dry in the biosafety cabinet overnight without the lid. Close the plate with the lid, and store at 4 °C in the refrigerator.\n\t\t​NOTE: The coated plates can be stored at 4 °C for up to 6 months.\nDay 1",
    "Take out the drug plate (100 µM in 90% DPBS + 10% DMSO, final concentration in the well for HTS will be 2 µM) stored in the −20 °C freezer, and place it at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Layout of the drug plate: Each 384-well plate (24 columns x 16 rows) contains 320 wells with different library compounds and 64 wells with blank solvent (DPBS containing 10% DMSO), which are arranged in four columns, with two columns on the edge of each side. See Supplemental Table S2 for the plate layout.\nWhen cells reach ~70%-90% confluency in the T-75 flask, detach the cells from the T-75 flask as described below. Prewarm all the media to 37 °C except for the DPBS (room temperature).\n\t\t\nRemove the spent medium, wash the cells with 10 mL of DPBS, and then remove the DPBS. Detach the cells from the T-75 flask using 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 3-5 min at 37 °C in the incubator, add 8 mL of selective medium, and transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube to centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of F-12K medium containing 1% FBS and 400 µg/mL G418 sulfate. Keep the suspension in the biosafety cabinet while determining the cell count.\nDetermine the cell density of the suspension for further dilution: Mix 20 µL of cell suspension into 20 µL of 0.4% trypan blue, and then load 20 µL of the mixture into a cell counting chamber to be read by a cell counter for cell density.",
    "Dilute the cell suspension in the same medium (F-12K medium containing 1% FBS and 400 µg/mL G418 sulfate) to a final volume of at least 15 mL at a density of 4 × 105 cells/mL.\nSeed the cells in the PDL-coated 384-well plate. Transfer 15 mL of the above cell suspension (4 × 105 cells/mL) into a 150 mL auto-friendly reagent reservoir. Dispense 25 µL of the cell suspension (~10,000 cells/well) into each well of the 384 wells of the plate using a liquid handling system in two steps. Load 384/12.5 µL low-retention tips onto the liquid handler head, aspirate 12.5 µL from the reservoir (speed 5.2 µL/s), and dispense into each well (speed: 3.1 µL/s).\nRepeat the pipetting as in previous step 2.2.5 to reach 25 µL per well. Then, incubate the plate overnight (14-16 h) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the humidified incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: As the maximum pipetting volume is 12.5 µL for this specific head, pipetting for 25 µL is performed in two steps.\nDay 2\n\t\nThe next morning, check the covered cell plate under a microscope; if not confluent, wait until the cells reach 90% confluency.\nPrepare a stock solution of fluorescent dye: Resuspend lyophilized fluorescent dye in 100 µL of DMSO, and avoid direct light on the stock solution. Wrap the tube with aluminum foil to prevent photobleaching.\n\t\tNOTE: The stock can be aliquoted into 15 µL aliquots for each plate assay to avoid repeated freezing and thawing; the aliquots can be stored at −80 °C for up to 1 month.",
    "In the biosafety cabinet with its lights off, prepare loading dye (1x) in a 15 mL conical tube wrapped with aluminum foil, combining 15 µL of the fluorescent dye stock solution (from step 2.3.2) and the rest of the prewarmed kit components (37 °C): 13.5 mL of 1x HHBS (Hank's buffer with 20 mM HEPES) and 1.5 mL of reagent B (dye efflux inhibitor).\n\t\tNOTE: The room light is on during this step.\nClose the tube and mix well by gently inverting the tube several (typically 3-5x) times.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep at room temperature, and use the loading dye mixture within 30 min.\nWhen the cells reach 90% confluency, remove the spent medium from the 384-well assay plate by quickly inverting the plate and gently blotting on sterile paper towels; repeat this movement 2x-3x to remove all the liquid from the plate. Discard the wet towels.\nTurn off most artificial direct lights in the room (leaving a soft, dim desk lamp on or similar to allow visible work conditions) and in the biosafety cabinet for all the steps until the end of the assay (approximately for 1.5 h).\nPlace 15 mL of the loading dye (1x) from step 2.3.3 into a 150 mL auto-friendly reservoir.\n\t\t\nTransfer 25 µL of the loading dye (1x) from the reservoir into each well using a liquid handling system with 384/12.5 µL low-retention tips by dispensing 12.5 µL into each well of the plate (aspiration and dispensing speed: 3.8 µL/s).\nRepeat the pipetting step as in 2.3.7.1 to reach a final volume of 25 µL in each well of the plate. Cover and wrap the plate with aluminum foil to protect it from ambient light.",
    "Incubate the covered cell plate at 37 °C in the CO2 humidified incubator for 30 min, remove it from the incubator, and equilibrate it at room temperature inside the plate reader or on the bench, keeping the plate covered and wrapped with foil for another 30 min. The cells are then ready for high-throughput screening (HTS).\nChemical preparation: Spin the drug plate from step 2.2.1 at 1,200 × g in a plate centrifuge for 1 min at room temperature.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 10x agonist peptide solution of Rhimi-K-1 (QFSPWGamide) (10 µM) by resuspending 100 nmoles of lyophilized peptide in 10 mL of 1x HHBS containing 0.1% DMSO, and transfer the solution into a 150 mL auto-friendly reservoir.\nMeasure the background signal: For the entire HTS assay in the plate reader, under Protocols, choose end-point fluorescence mode.\n\t\tNOTE: The fluorescent signal is read from the bottom of the plate at excitation/emission wavelengths of 495 nm/525 nm.\n\t\t\nInsert the cell plate into the plate reader. In the instrument panel, select adjust gain, select a random well on the plate, assign it as 5%-10% of the maximum measurable fluorescence value, and select adjust (reading) height.\nClick start measurement to read the whole plate for the background fluorescence signal in relative fluorescence units (RFU).\n\"Dual-addition\" assay\n\t\t\nUsing the liquid handling system with 384/12.5 µL tips, to mix the drug solution in each well of the drug plate, pipette 3x up and down 10 µL of the drug solution (in DPBS containing 10% DMSO) (pipetting speed: 5.2 µL/s), and \"aspirate\" 1.5 µL from each well of the drug plate (aspiration speed: 1.0 µL/s).\n\"Dispense\" 0.5 µL of the compounds into the cell assay plate (pipetting speed: 1 µL/s) to reach a final concentration of 2 µM in 0.2% DMSO.",
    "Place the assay plate immediately into the plate reader after adding the screening compounds. Read the same plate in both the forward and reverse reading directions. To obtain these readouts, define a program to read from \"well 1-384\" and immediately from \"384-1\".\n\t\t\tNOTE: The readout in both directions takes 2 min in total. This readout design is to compensate for the decrease in signal strength that occurs during plate reading in each direction. See step 3.1 for the readout analyses.\nDispose of the remaining 1 µL of drug solution in the tips by immersing the tips into a 150 mL waste reservoir containing ~50 mL of DPBS (dispensing speed: 1.0 µL/s).\nIncubate the screening compounds with the cells for a total of 5 min (includes the 2 min of plate reading) at room temperature in the biosafety cabinet with the lights off. Add 3 µL of the agonist peptide, Rhimi-K-1 (QFSPWGamide), from the reservoir (aspiration speed: 3.1 µL/s) into the assay plate using the liquid handling system (dispensing speed: 3.1 µL/s) with 384/12.5 µL tips.\nPlace the plate into the plate reader immediately after the addition of the agonist peptide. Read the plate in both the forward and reverse directions using the same program as in step 2.3.12.3\n3. Data analysis\nUsing the analysis software associated with the plate reader installed on a computer, calculate the cellular fluorescence responses (in RFU) for both readings after the first compound addition (First read; RFUago [Supplemental Table S2]) and after the agonist addition steps (Second read = RFUant [Supplemental Table S2]). Each read is obtained by averaging the two values obtained (not shown) by the forward and reverse plate readings from step 2.3.12.3 and step 2.3.12.6, respectively.",
    "NOTE: RFUago, RFUant refer to the relative fluorescence units of the potential agonist hits (read in step 2.3.12.3) and the potential antagonist hits (read in step 2.3.12.6), respectively.\nExport all three sets of data, RFUbg, RFUago, and RFUant, from the analysis software into three separate spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet will have only two columns: well position and raw RFU (files not shown here).\n\tNOTE: RFUbg refers to the RFU of the background read in step 2.3.11.2.\nFormat the data from the three spreadsheets, and organize the above data in one csv file (see the example in Supplemental Table S2). Subtract the background signal read from the RFUago and RFUant, respectively (G and H columns in Supplemental Table S2).\nImport the csv file into a commercially available \"online HTS data platform\" (see the Table of Materials) for downstream data analysis (Table 1) and storage.\nManually calculate the Z'-factor for the quality control of each plate assay using equation (1):\n\tequation (1):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64505/64505eq01.jpg    (1)\n\tNOTE: µc- and µc+ represent the average RFUs of readings of the same wells, which serve as negative controls in the first addition after adding the solvent (blank solvent, n = 64; numbers in blue in Supplemental Table S2) and serve as positive controls after the addition of the agonist (blank solvent + agonist, n = 64; numbers in magenta), respectively. Additionally, σc- and σc+ represent their corresponding standard deviations (SDs).\nManually select the hit molecules from the heat maps on the \"online HTS data platform,\" and calculate the normalized percent activation (NPA) and inhibitory activity (Io) for the agonist hits and antagonist hits using equation (2) and equation (3):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64505/64505eq02.jpg    (2)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64505/64505eq03.jpg    (3)\nSubscription Required.
