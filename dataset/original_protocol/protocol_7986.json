    "All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of South Carolina.\n1. Stock solution preparation\nSolution 1 (1 L): To 900 mL of deionized H2O add 100 mL of 10x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 2 mL of Triton X-100.\nSolution 2 (1 L): To 900 mL of deionized H2O, add 100 mL of 10x PBS, 2mL of Tween-20 and 1 mL of 10 mg/mL Heparin stock solution.\nSolution 3 (500 mL): To 400 mL of Solution 1, add 11.5 g of glycine and 100 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).\nSolution 4 (50 mL): To 42 mL of Solution 1, add 3 mL of corresponding serum and 5 mL of DMSO.\nPrimary antibody solution (50 mL): To 46 mL of Solution 2, add 2.5 mL of DMSO and 1.5 mL of corresponding serum.\nSecondary antibody solution (50 mL): To 48.5 mL of Solution 2, add 1.5 mL of corresponding serum.\n\tNOTE: For Solution 4, primary solution, and secondary solution, use a serum that corresponds with the secondary antibody (e.g., goat, horse, bovine).\n2. Sample preparation\nNOTE: Perform steps 2.1 through 2.7 in a fume hood due to limit the exposure to PFA.\nDeeply anesthetize young (3-6 week) rat using sevoflurane; proceed to 2.2 when rat is not responsive and fails to respond to toe and tail pinch.\nLay the rat in a supine position and make an incision through the abdominal wall using a pair of Iris scissors.\nCut up through the bottom of the rib cage to the collarbone on both sides of the rib cage using Mayo scissors.\nAffix the sternum and ribs away from the heart and lungs with a hemostat.",
    "Pierce the left ventricle with a 23 G needle attached to a perfusion pump and cut the right atrium with Iris scissors.\nPerform transcardial perfusion with approximately 75 mL of 100 mM (1x) PBS.\nContinue transcardial perfusion with approximately 100 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) buffered in 1x PBS.\nRemove the brain from the skull using forceps.\nPlace the brain in sagittal position and slice into 4 equal sections (approximately 3 mm in width) using a razor blade and a rat brain matrix.\nFix each section in 4% PFA in 1x PBS in a sealed, 5mL plastic tube overnight at 4 °C on a shaker.\nContinue to fix in 4% PFA in 1x PBS at room temperature (RT) on a shaker for 1 h.\nWash each section with 1x PBS at RT for 30 min, 3 times.\n3. Dehydration and depigmentation\nIncubate the sample in a 20% methanol/80% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in a 40% methanol/60% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in a 60% methanol/40% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in an 80% methanol/20% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in 100% methanol for 1 h at RT. Repeat with more 100% methanol, incubating for 1 h at RT.\nChill the sample in 100% methanol at 4° C for approximately 10 min.\nPrepare a 66% dichloromethane (DCM)/33% methanol solution.\nIncubate the sample overnight in the DCM/methanol solution at RT, with shaking.\nWash with methanol at RT for 30 min, 2 times.\nChill the sample in 100% methanol at 4° C for approximately 10 min.\nBleach in chilled, freshly prepared 5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol overnight at 4° C.",
    "Incubate the sample in an 80% methanol/20% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in a 60% methanol/40% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in a 40% methanol/60% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in a 20% methanol/80% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in 1x PBS for 1 h at RT.\nWash in Solution 1 for 1 h at RT, 2 times.\n4. Cholera Toxin Subunit B labeling\nInsert needle tip of 1 mL syringe into nucleus accumbens site.\nSlowly inject 2.5 μL of 1% biotin-CTB over 20 s.\nLeave the needle tip in place for 1 min and remove slowly over 10 s to prevent leakage.\n5. Antibody application\nIncubate the sample in Solution 3 for 2 days at 37 °C in a water bath.\nIncubate the sample in Solution 4 for 2 days at 37 °C in a water bath.\nIncubate with primary antibody for 7 days at 37 °C in a water bath.\nWash in Solution 2 for 5 times, incubating 1 h per wash. Store in Solution 2 at RT overnight.\nIncubate with secondary antibody for 7 days at 37 °C in water bath.\nWash in Solution 2 for 5 times, incubating 1 h per wash; store in Solution 2 at RT overnight.\n\tNOTE: All steps from 5.6 onwards, including final storage, should occur in low light. The sample tubes can be shielded with aluminum foil. The concentrations used for the antibodies in this protocol were: TH at 1:100, Iba1 at 1:200, and the secondary antibody at 1:100. Add additional Solution 2 to steps 5.1-5.6 to ensure tubes are completely filled.\n6. Tissue clearing",
    "Incubate the sample in a 20% methanol/80% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in a 40% methanol/60% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in a 60% methanol/40% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in an 80% methanol/20% deionized water solution for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate the sample in 100% methanol for 1 h at RT.\nIncubate in fresh 100% methanol overnight at RT.\nIncubate in 66% DCM/33% methanol for 3 h, with shaking, at room temperature.\nIncubate in dibenzyl ether (DBE) without shaking. Leave the sample in DBE until clear and store in DBE until imaging.\n7. Mounting\nObtain a 3D printed chamber made of Visijet M3 Crystal resin (templates available on the idisco.info website).\nSecure the chamber to a microscope slide using an epoxy.\nPlace the sample in the square space in the middle of the chamber.\nFill the chamber completely with DBE.\nPlace a 0.17 mm thick coverslip over the chamber and apply pressure until the coverslip has full contact with the chamber walls.\nSeal the edges of the coverslip to the chamber using the epoxy.\nRotate the chamber to allow air bubbles to escape from the filling inlet.\nFill the chamber with additional DBE.\nSeal the filling inlet with epoxy and allow to cure.\n\tNOTE: Excess DBE will spill out during mounting.\n8. Imaging\nUse a confocal microscope system to perform z-scan at 4x magnification (see the attached 3D video).\nAchieve fluorescent excitation of the sample using a laser set to emit at a wavelength similar to the wavelength specified by the secondary antibody. TH excitation was achieved utilizing a HeNe laser set to emit at 632 nm.",
    "Set the detector to a wavelength close to the laser emission. For the present protocol, the detector for TH was set to 650 nm.\nRaise the gain of the detector until there is a visible signal. The 650LP gain for images was set to 7.50 B.\nUsing the Scan option in the confocal imaging software, move the microscope stage until the sample is brought into focus.\nNavigate around the tissue in all plains and obtain either single images or z-stack images using the confocal imaging software.\nOnce imaging is completed, remove the sample from the chamber. Place it back into a tube completely filled with DBE and store at RT in a dark place, preferably covered in aluminum foil.\n\tNOTE: Samples can be remounted and imaged as long as the florescence signal is still strong.\nSubscription Required.
