The leftover tamoxifen after every experiment is discarded to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nDissolved tamoxifen can be stored at −20°C for long term.\nCritical: All tamoxifen material should be handled while wearing laboratory gloves and mask.\nTo identify plugged dams and calculate the date for the collection of embryos and postnatal pups\nTiming: N/A\nThe following protocol is for the identification of a plugged dam.\nFor best results, mate one male mouse and 3 female mice in one cage.\nCheck plugs early in the morning every day.\nThe morning of seeing the plug is Embryonic day (E) 0.5.\nInject tamoxifen (TM) intraperitoneally for pregnant dams and subcutaneously for postnatal pups on required dates. Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nCalculate the date of analysis based on the plug observation.\nIsolating tissues from embryos and pups for immunostaining\nTiming: 2 days",
    "This protocol breaks down the steps involved in isolating and processing mouse embryonic and postnatal tissues for whole-mount immunostaining.

Pipeline of embryonic tissue collection and processing\nFor embryonic tissue collection, tamoxifen (TM) injected pregnant dams are euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. Embryonic tissues are harvested in the following manner:\nPlace the euthanized pregnant dam face up on a flat surface.\nWet her abdomen with 70% EtOH and create a superficial incision in the skin using dissecting scissors without cutting through the peritoneal sac.\nCut across the skin longitudinally to reveal the peritoneal sac.\nCreate an incision in the peritoneal membrane and cut across longitudinally to expose the contents of the peritoneum.\nBare the uterine horn to unveil the number of embryos.\nNote: At this point, label and keep ready 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for embryonic tail collection for genotyping.\nExcise the uterine horn from the body and place in ice cold 1× PBS.\nCut through the uterine membrane and uncover individual embryos.\nPeel the amniotic sac enveloping individual embryos and separate the embryos from the placenta.\nNote: Keep a 10 cm dish with ice cold 1× PBS ready.\nTransfer the embryos to the 10 cm dish with ice cold 1X PBS.\nClip off about 2 mm of the tail and place the tails at the bottom of a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube for genotyping.\nCritical: To prevent cross contamination of DNA during genotyping, 1) replace with fresh PBS if the solution is bloody; 2) keep embryos away from each other in the dish; and 3) clean the scissors used for tailing with 70% EtOH between each embryo.\nNow the embryos are ready for tissue collection under the dissecting microscope.\nEuthanize the embryos by decapitation.",
    "To collect E16.5 and E18.5 axillary and back skin, pin the embryos onto a sylgard 184 pad and create an incision on the ventral lower abdominal skin using spring scissors and cut across the abdomen longitudinally to expose the peritoneal sac (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNow separate the layer of skin from the peritoneal sac gently using Iris forceps and from mid abdomen to back left of the fetus, cutting connections whenever necessary.\nRepeat on the right side.\nYou will now be able to pin out the skin, vascular side up, on a sylgard 184 pad.\nTo collect the mesentery, create an incision in the peritoneal membrane on the ventral lower abdomen using spring scissors and cut across longitudinally towards the neck exposing the organs of the peritoneal cavity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2587-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

You will need intact lymphatic vessels stretching from the mesenteric lymph node to the gut for immunostaining.",
    "Discard the embryos along with the dam in a red biohazard bag.\nTo fix embryonic tissues, use 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nFix tissues in 1% PFA in PBS (1×) + NaN3 (0.05%) for ∼16 h at 4°C.

    "For ear collection from P21 pups, excise the ears from the head (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]):\nPlace the ear with the inner side facing up under the dissecting microscope on a flat surface.\nUse a feather scalpel to slice the edge of the bottom corners of the ear to create a gap between the inner side and the outer side of the ear with the cartilage layer between these two sides.\nUse precision tweezers to remove the inner side skin together with the cartilage layer from the outer side skin to reveal the underlying vascular dermis on the outer side skin.\nNote: Take care to not break the cartilage layer or to leave any cartilage on the vascular dermis of the outer side skin. It will be difficult to image the ear lymphatics with a cartilage layer on top.\nPin down the outer side skin of the ear, vascular side up on a sylgard 184 pad along the edge.\nFix ear tissue in 2% PFA in PBS (1×) + NaN3 (0.05%) for ∼16 h on an orbital shaker at 4°C.

The diaphragm will be at the end of the ribcage and above the liver (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nHold the costal muscles with the iris forceps and snip at the muscle to release the diaphragm from the lower ribcage.\nSnip all around the costal muscles to release the diaphragm from the ribcage and liver.\nFinally separate the diaphragm from the vertebral column.",
    "Pin the diaphragm on a sylgard 184 pad with the central tendon domain side up.\nNote: Clean the central tendon domain off any connective tissue because the connective tissue can hamper imaging (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2587-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

For example, if the expression levels of 5 genes are to be analyzed, the total number of wells for preparing the master mix will be 3 × 5 = 15 wells. To compensate for the pipetting error, prepare the master mix for an extra well. So, it will be 16 wells (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2587_1.csv\nPipette 5.5 μL PCR master mix for a probe into each well of a 384 well plate.\nAdd the 4.5 μL cDNA template after.\nNote: Use GAPDH as control.\nSeal the qPCR plate with a transparent optical adhesive cover.\nRun a qRT-PCR on a QuantStudio 6 real-time PCR system.\nRun program for a fast standard curve.\nThe program should take about 32 min.\nNote: Choose the program for qRT-PCR according to the type of TaqMan PCR master mix.\nImmunostaining of hdLECs\nTiming: 2 days\nThe following protocol lists out the steps involved in in vitro staining of cultured hdLECs.\nDay 1:\nCulture the cells on the glass coverslips.\nWhen the cells are ready, remove the media and wash the cells with PBS once.\nFix them with 4% PFA for 12 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWash three times with PBS (1X)+NaN3 (0.05%), 5 min each time.\nNote: You can store the cells in 4 degrees at this step. But make sure that the cells don’t dry, and bacteria contamination does not occur during storage.\nPermeabilize the cells with 0.1% triton+PBS (1X)+NaN3 (0.05%) for 20 min at 20°C–22°C.\nBlock the cells with 3% donkey serum in PBS (1X)+NaN3 (0.05%) (blocking buffer) for 30 min to 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nDilute the antibodies in the blocking buffer according to the concentration.\nAdd primary antibodies.\nNote: For square coverslips, 200 μL blocking buffer is sufficient.",
    "Incubate in the wet box for ∼16 h at 4°C.\nDay 2:\nWash three times with PBS (1X)+NaN3 (0.05%), 5 min each time.\nDilute the secondary antibodies in the PBS (1X)+NaN3 (0.05%) according to the concentration.\nAdd secondary antibodies.\nIncubate in the wet box for 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nWash three times with PBS (1X)+NaN3 (0.05%), 5 min each time.\nMount with mounting media and image."
