    "HabituationComplete during light cycle.Keep rats on cart outside training room in home cages and allow rats to remain undisturbed for 20 min following transportation from animal care room prior to any behavioural procedure.Turn on air exchanger.Turn on medical air tank so air is freely flowing through shock box.Wearing gloves, a labcoat, hairnet, and face mask, take rats one at a time from home cage, bring into training room, place in shock box (grid turned off) with fan-attached lid on top and turned on.Rats in odor + shock (O+/S+) and odor only companion (O+/Comp) conditions are pair housed starting a week prior to habituation.Rats in odor only (O+/S-), shock only (O-/S+), and soiled bedding (O+/SB) conditions, and O+/S+ soiled bedding donor rats are housed individually.Let animal explore context for 30 min.Return animal to home cage.Clean the shock box.Spray all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol (Recipe 4).Wipe with paper towel.Attach the lid with fan and evacuation tubing and turn on to dissipate odors.Wait at least 10 min before moving on to next animal to ensure no residual odors remain in room.This prevents the animal from associating the shock with the context, and promotes specific fear conditioning to the presented odor.TrainingComplete during light cycle.Keep rats on cart outside training room in home cages and allow rats to remain undisturbed for 20 min following transportation from animal care room prior to any behavioural procedure.Turn on air exchanger.Turn on medical air flow.Train animals for 1 day according to their condition, detailed below.Note: Training of rats in condition c must always immediately precede conditions d and e in cagemate/pairwise fashion but order of training for other groups does not matter. O+/S- ConditionBring each rat to conditioning room and place in shock box (grid turned on) and cover with fan-attached lid turned on.Start timer.",
    "At 4 min, release c-flex tubing so terpinene odor enters shock chamber.Allow terpinene (Recipe 1) to flow through tubing for 1 min, then close c-flex tubing to stop terpinene flow.Repeat odor delivery as described in Steps B5aiii and B5aiv at 14, 19, and 29 min.Remove rat from shock chamber and return to home cage immediately.Clean shock chamber.1)Spray down all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol.2)Place fan-attached lid on shock chamber and turn on to remove all residual odor.3)Wait at least 10 min to introduce the next rat.O-/S+ ConditionBring each rat to conditioning room and place in shock box (grid turned on) and cover with fan-attached lid turned on.Start timer.At 5, 15, 20, and 30 min press manual shock button to deliver one 1 s 0.5 mA shock.Remove rat from shock chamber and return to home cage immediately.Clean shock chamber.1)Spray down all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol.2)Place fan-attached lid on shock chamber and turn on to remove all residual odor.3)Wait at least 10 min to introduce the next rat.O+/S+ ConditionBring rat to conditioning room and place in shock box (grid turned on) and cover with fan-attached lid turned on.Note: It is important that O+/Comp companion rat stays in home cage away from training room during O+/S+ training. Start timer.At 4 min, release c-flex tubing so terpinene odor enters shock chamber.Allow terpinene to flow through tubing for 1 min.At 4:59 (during last second of odor delivery), press manual shock button to deliver one 1 s 0.5 mA shock.Close c-flex tubing to stop terpinene flow.Repeat odor delivery as described in Steps B5ciii-B5cvi at 14, 19, and 29 min.Remove rat from shock chamber and return to home cage with companion rat immediately.Clean shock chamber.1)Spray down all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol.2)Place fan-attached lid on shock chamber and turn on to remove all residual odor.",
    "3)Wait 10 min to introduce the next rat. Note: This must be the corresponding companion rat (O+/Comp).O+/Comp ConditionFollowing 10 min of interaction with freshly trained O+/S+ companion rat, bring each rat to conditioning room and place in shock box (grid turned on) and cover with fan-attached lid turned on.Note: It is important that O+/S+ companion rat stays in home cage away from training room during O+/Comp training. Start timer.At 4 min, release c-flex tubing so terpinene odor enters shock chamber.Allow terpinene to flow through tubing for 1 min, then close c-flex tubing to stop terpinene flow.Repeat odor delivery as described in Steps B5diii and B5div at 14, 19, and 29 min.Remove rat from shock chamber and return to home cage with O+/S+ companion rat immediately.Clean shock chamber.1)Spray down all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol.2)Place fan-attached lid on shock chamber and turn on to remove all residual odor.3)Wait at least 10 min to introduce the next rat.O+/SB conditionNote: Train O+/SB rats immediately following training of separately singly housed O+/S+ soiled bedding donor rat, place bedding in tray underneath shock grid during O+/S+ soiled bedding donor rat training, and do not clean shock box between animals, so that O+/SB is exposed to the soiled bedding of the O+/S+ donor rat. Bring each rat to conditioning room and place in shock box (grid turned on) and cover with fan-attached lid turned on.Start timer.At 4 min, release c-flex tubing so terpinene odor enters shock chamber.Allow terpinene to flow through tubing for 1 min, then close c-flex tubing to stop terpinene flow.Repeat odor delivery as described in Steps B5eiii and B5eiv at 14, 19, and 29 min.Remove rat from shock chamber and return to home cage immediately.Clean shock chamber.1)Spray down all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol.",
    "2)Place fan-attached lid on shock chamber and turn on to remove all residual odor.3)Wait at least 10 min to introduce the next rat.O+/Ph conditionIn tray underneath shock grid, place clean bedding material and a piece of filter paper soaked with 0.75 ml 4-methylpentanal and hexanal binary mixture (Recipe 3).Bring each rat to conditioning room and place in shock box (grid turned on) and cover with fan-attached lid turned on.Start timer.At 4 min, release c-flex tubing so terpinene odor enters shock chamber.Allow terpinene to flow through tubing for 1 min, then close c-flex tubing to stop terpinene flow.Repeat odor delivery as described in Steps B5fiii and B5fiv at 14, 19, and 29 min.Remove rat from shock chamber and return to home cage immediately.Clean shock chamber.1)Spray down all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol.2)Place fan-attached lid on shock chamber and turn on to remove all residual odor.3)Wait at least 10 min to introduce the next rat.4)Replace bedding and filter paper soaked with 0.75 ml 4-methylpentanal and hexanal binary mixture. TestingComplete during light cycle.Keep rats on cart outside training room in home cages and allow rats to remain undisturbed for 20 min following transportation from animal care room prior to any behavioural procedure.Turn on the air exchanger.Set up a laptop and webcam so rat is visible and testing session can be recorded.Turn on medical air flow.Wearing gloves, a labcoat, hairnet, and face mask, take rats one at a time from home cage, bring into training room, place in shock chamber (grid turned off) with clear lid on.Start the timer.Start recording video.Keep medical air flowing through for 15 min to observe baseline behavior.At 15 min, release c-flex tubing so terpinene can flow through shock chamber.Observe freezing behavior for 15 min during odor exposure.Use stopwatch to record total amount of freezing time.",
    "Note: This may be cut down to 5 min of medical air and 5 min of odor exposure. Remove the rat from shock chamber and return to home cage.Clean shock chamber.Spray down all interior surfaces with 70% ethanol.Place fan-attached lid on shock chamber and turn on to remove all residual odor.Wait at least 10 min to introduce the next rat.Repeat entire testing procedure using octanol (Recipe 2) (control odor) in Step C10 instead of terpinene in separate testing sessions during a different part of the day (e.g., if testing with terpinene was done in the morning, do octanol testing in the afternoon)."
