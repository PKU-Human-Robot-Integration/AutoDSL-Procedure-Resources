After this step, potato plants are ready to be transiently transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the TurboID construct.\nGrow fresh cuttings of potato plants on MS20 in vitro at 24°C in a climate chamber, under long day conditions (16 h/8 h day/night), for 2 weeks.\nTransfer plantlets to 5 cm diameter round pots containing sterilized potting soil in climate-regulated greenhouse compartment.\nGrow for 1 week within a temperature range of 18°C–22°C and long day conditions.\nTransfer to 11 × 11 cm square pots or to 14 cm diameter round pots.\nGrow for 3–5 weeks under the same conditions.\nNote: Some potato genotypes grow better in round pots. Check troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: Number of plants to grow depends on setting of the experiment. Samples for MS undergo triplicate sending for statistical analysis. One replicate consists of a set of five plants and per plant, 3–5 leaves are infiltrated with the construct. Therefore, 15 plants in total per set of TurboID construct (5 × 3).\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens preparation and agroinfiltration\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nTurboID constructs are transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens and transiently transform on potato leaves with an appropriated transformation buffer.\nTransform 100 ng of the plasmid containing the TurboID fusion constructs to 20 μL of electro-competent Agrobacterium tumefaciens (in 1,5 mL Eppendorf tube).\nPipette Agrobacterium cells with DNA into a prechilled 0,2 cm electroporation cuvette.\nPulse cells at 1,4 kV with MicroPulser Electroporator.\nAdd 0,25 mL of YEB (or LB) media to the cuvette, mix, and immediately transfer cells into a clean 1,5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nGrow for 2 h at 28°C and 200 rpm.",
    "Plate 20–50 μL on LB agar plates (90 mm diameter) with the appropriate antibiotics.\nNote: In this protocol, YFP-TurboID and NbSOBIR1-TurboID constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium strain C58C1 and StCDF1-TurboID into AGL1. The antibiotics for C58C1 are Ra and Te, and for AGL1 are Cm and Cb. In addition, Kn antibiotic is added for selection of Agrobacterium colonies transformed with TurboID construct. Working concentrations are specified in “Materials and equipment”.\nNote: A. tumefaciens transformation by electroporation has high efficiency and usually produces 30–60 colonies using this set-up. Longer incubation times (up to 4 h) in LB will increase efficiency.\nOptional: Test different A. tumefaciens strains to check the accumulation of the fusion POI upon transient expression. Check troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] & 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nPick a single transformed A. tumefaciens colony and grow in 10 mL of LB media with the appropriate antibiotics\nIncubate for 2 days at 28°C with continuous shaking at 200 rpm.\nNote: We recommend verifying constructs transformed in Agrobacterium. Perform colony PCR with 5 μL of the A. tumefaciens culture using the primers P35S-CaMV-Fw and YFP-Rv, or a combination of the P35S-CaMV-Fw primer with a reverse primer from the gene. Send PCR product for Sanger sequencing with primers used for colony PCR.\nTransfer the cultures to a 250 mL flask containing YEB media with the appropriate antibiotics and supplemented with acetosyringone (final concentration 200 μM) and MES solution 1 (final concentration 10 mM).\nIncubate for 1 day at 28°C with continuous shaking at 200 rpm.\nCollect the cells by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min.\nResuspend the pelleted cells in freshly prepared MMA buffer to an OD600 of 0,3–0,4.\nNote: For co-infiltration of two constructs, mix the A. tumefaciens cultures in a 1:1 ratio.",
    "Note: 30–50 mL of A. tumefaciens culture is usually enough for infiltrating 3–5 leaves per set of triplicates. Potato leaf size varies a lot and different genotypes have different structure, such as trichome density etc., which results in different requirements for A. tumefaciens infiltrate. On average, 1 mL is sufficient for 1 potato leaf.\nIncubate the A. tumefaciens suspensions in MMA for 1–2 h at 20°C–25°C in dark without rolling or shaking before infiltration.\nFully infiltrate 3–5 leaves of each potato plant with the suspension from the lower side of the leaves with a 1 mL needleless syringe.\nOptional: Water the potato plants 1–2 h before agroinfiltration to facilitate the infiltration of the suspension, as the stomata will open. Make a scratch on the lower epidermis of the leaves to be infiltrated with a needle or scalpel to facilitate the infiltration. Check troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: Choose young, healthy, and just fully expanded leaves for the agroinfiltrations.\nNote: We recommend changing gloves between each set of constructs to avoid possible contamination between different constructs.\nNote: Infiltrated plants are maintained in the greenhouse within a temperature range of 18°C–22°C and under long day conditions.\nLeaf sample collection\nTiming: 2 days\nThe recombinant TurboID bait proteins should be successfully expressed in the leaves after 2 days. Leaves are harvested and prepared for protein extraction procedure.\nOptional: Test with and without the addition of biotin. Check troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nOptional: After 36–48 hpi, infiltrate freshly prepared solution of 10 μM biotin in MES solution 2 and collect leaf samples at 1–3 hpi after the infiltration of biotin.\nOptional: To reduce the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, 40 μM MG-132 can be additionally supply together with biotin solution.",
    "Note: The concentration and incubation time of biotin treatment was determined based on previous studies in Arabidopsis and N. benthamiana.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nAfter 36–48 hpi, cut the leaves off, remove the petiole and middle vein from the base with scissors.\nPlace in a 50 mL tube with V-shaped bottom and immediately place into liquid nitrogen.\nNote: We recommend cleaning the scissors used for removing the petiole and middle vein with ethanol 70% between different treatments.\nPause point: Keep leaves at −80°C, either the intact leaves or ground, in tubes.\nGrind samples in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle to a fine powder and weigh.\nNote: Make sure that the triplicates are all approximately of the same weight; 3–5 g ± 0.5 g.\nProtein extraction\nTiming: 2–3 h\nTotal protein is extracted from the transiently transformed potato leaves.\nAdd 2 mL of RIPA buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and MG-132, per gram of ground leaf.\nNote: MG-132 is a proteome inhibitor and blocks the activity of proteasomes. It targets protein degradation differently from the protease inhibitor. For some proteins, such as DELLA,8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] MG-132 is crucial for its stability. Therefore, we recommended to supply MG-132 in with RIPA buffer.\nKeep samples on ice, while vortex-mixing for 15 min.\nVortex-mixing each sample, while keeping samples cold by placing the samples on ice during the rest time.\nPellet the debris by centrifugation for 30 min at 4°C at maximum speed (RCF: 17,000 × g).\nNote: Make sure that the supernatant is clear, without remaining particles.\nTransfer the supernatant to a pre-cooled V-shaped 15 mL tube.\nAdjust all samples to 10 mL with RIPA buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and MG132.\nNote: Preferably use LoBind tubes for all steps.\nNote: The total volume of the samples should be around 10 mL.",
    "Note: Each Cytiva Life Sciences PD-10 desalting column can only hold 2.5 mL per column. Per sample, approx. 10 mL of isolated protein solution is obtained, so 4 columns are needed.\nRemoval of free biotin from the protein extracts with Cytiva Life Sciences PD-10 desalting columns\nTiming: 1–2 h\nBiotin present in the total extract of proteins is filtered out to avoid the competition for binding the streptavidin beads used in the next step for enrichment of biotinylated proteins.\nNote: The following steps should be performed in 4°C room.\nEquilibrate the PD-10 desalting columns.\nPlace the column in the provided rack and place a container below to collect the flow-through.\nRemove the top cap.\nCut the sealed end and allow the storage solution to drain away.\nWash the column 3× with 4 mL of RIPA without protease inhibitor cocktail and without MG132.\nWash the column 1× with 4 mL of RIPA with protease inhibitor cocktail and with MG132.\nAdd 2.5 mL of the protein extract to the equilibrated PD-10 desalting column.\nDiscard the flow-through.\nTransfer the columns to another rack, containing V-shaped 50 mL tubes.\nElute the columns with 3,5 mL of RIPA, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and MG132.\nCombine the eluates from each triplicate in one tube.\nPull down of the biotinylated proteins with Thermo Scientific Pierce streptavidin magnetic beads\nTiming: 3 h\nPull-down methodology using streptavidin beads is employed to enrich biotinylated proteins. Biotin labelled proteins from each sample pool will be subsequent analyzed by Western blot and/or LC-MS for their identification.\nNote: Perform the following steps at 4°C.\nNote: In parallel, perform a test for checking the protein extract on a western blot.\nEquilibrate the streptavidin beads.\nResuspend the beads by pipetting and stirring before use.",
    "Pipette 200 μL of streptavidin beads (50% slurry) per sample in a 2 mL LoBind tube.\nNote: For the test sample, use 50 μL of streptavidin beads per sample (50% slurry).\nNote: The volume of the beads per sample (200 μL for MS sample and 100 μL for test sample in this protocol) can be adjust based on the volume of desalted protein extracts and incubation time.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nNote: To estimate the total volume of beads necessary to process all the samples, including an extra volume of 5% to account for pipetting errors, follow this calculation:\nTotal\nvolume\nof\nbeads\n=\n105\n%\n×\n(\nNumber\nof\nsamples\n×\nVolume\nof\nbeads\nper\nsample\n)\nFor example, if there are 5 samples, and each sample requires 200 μL of beads:\nTotal\nvolume\nof\nbeads\n=\n1,05\n×\n(\n5\n×\n200\nμ\nL\n)\n=\n1050\nμ\nL\n.\nPlace the tube into a magnetic stand for 3 min to collect the beads.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nWash the beads 3× with 1 mL of RIPA, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and MG-132.\nNote: For each washing step, add the buffer and mix by inversion until the beads are completely resuspended, and let the tube stand for 3 min in the magnetic rack, after which the supernatant is discarded.\nAfter the last wash add 100 μL of RIPA per sample, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, to the equilibrated beads and transfer the 100 μL resuspended beads to each of the V-shaped 15 mL tubes containing the desalted protein extracts.\nNote: For the test sample, add 50 μL of RIPA per sample, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail.\nIncubate the samples in a rotator for 1 h at 4°C, at 10 rpm.",
    "Note: You can extend the incubation up to 18 h (overnight) at 4°C, ensuring a gentle and continuous shake at 10 rpm.\nWash the beads.\nPlace the tubes into a magnetic stand for 3 min to collect the beads.\nDiscard the supernatants.\nNote: The supernatants can be collected (20–50 μL) and stored at −20°C for testing the binding efficiency at a later time point.\nAdd 1 mL of NP40-free RIPA, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail, and mix by inversion of the tubes.\nTransfer the mixture to a 2 mL LoBind tube.\nPlace the tubes into a magnetic stand for 3 min to collect the beads.\nWash the beads 3× with 1 mL of NP40-free RIPA, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail. Follow the same procedure as indicated in step 32 to wash the beads.\nThe samples are now ready for MS pre-processing. Go to step 53.\nThe sample test can be processed for western blot following step 39.\nPause point: Store the enriched biotinylated proteins at −20°C before further processing for MS.\nIdentification of biotinylated proteins by western blotting\nTiming: 4–5 h\nAfter the enrichment, verify biotinylated proteins through Western blot analysis. Visualize proteins using various antibodies to confirm bait expression and its capacity to biotinylate other proteins.\nNote: This step is only performed for the protein samples that will NOT be processed for MS\nResuspend the streptavidin beads to which the biotinylated proteins are bound in 60 μL of RIPA.\nAdd 20 μL of 4× Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad), previously mixed 9:1 with β-mercaptoethanol as the manufacturer’s recommendation (https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/4006028.pdf[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/4006028.pdf]).\nIncubate at 95°C for 10 min, in a shaker at 300 rpm.\nPlace the tubes on ice for 2 min.\nSpin the beads down at top speed in a microcentrifuge.\nLoad 15–25 μL of the supernatant on an SDS-PAGE gel.",
    "Note: To avoid pipetting the beads, leave the tubes in the magnetic rack,\nLoad 5 μL of the ladder Precision Plus Protein WesternC Blotting Standards.\nRun the gel in an electrophoresis cell with 1× Tris/Glycine/SDS buffer.\nTransfer the proteins to a Trans-Blot Turbo Mini 0.2 μm PVDF membrane in the Trans-Blot Turbo system at 25 V at 1,3 A for 7 min.\nBlock the membrane with 10 mL of StartingBlock (TBS) Blocking Buffer, supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) of Tween 20 for 30 min.\nNote: The standard blocking buffer, which consists of 5% of fat-free milk powder in TBS-T 1×, contains biotin that potentially interferes with the incubation of the blot with the streptavidin-HRP protein and subsequent detection steps. As an alternative, use Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) at a concentration of 3% in TBS-T 1×, or a commercial (biotin-free) blocking buffer as described in this protocol.\nAdd the appropriate antibody to the blocking buffer and incubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C or follow the manufacturer’s instructions.\nUse a BirA (mutated/TurboID) antibody diluted 1:5000 in StartingBlock (TBS) Blocking Buffer to determine the accumulation of the Turbo-ID fusion protein in planta.\nUse a Streptavidin-HRP protein diluted 1:5000 in StartingBlock (TBS) Blocking Buffer to check for the presence of biotinylated proteins purified from the pull down using the streptavidin beads.\nUse an α-HA, α-GFP or α-V5 antibody to detect the accumulation of fusion proteins carrying these tags in planta. In this protocol, we used α-GFP diluted 1:1000 in StartingBlock (TBS) Blocking Buffer.\nUse appropriate antibody(ies) when checking for the presence of additional differently labelled interactor(s) after the pull down e.g., to verify the biotinylation of a tagged known interactor.\nNote: The dilutions of antibodies are based on specifications for Western blotting detection substrate used. In this protocol, we used SuperSignal West Dura.",
    "If a secondary antibody is needed as for the BirA (mutated/TurboID) antibodies:\nWash the membrane 3 times with TBS-T 1× buffer.\nDilute the conjugated secondary antibody.\nNote: In this protocol, we used goat anti-rabbit IgG, HRP diluted 1:10000 in TBS-T 1× buffer.\nIncubate with the secondary antibody for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the membrane 3 times with TBS-T 1× buffer.\nDevelop the blot with the ECL substrate of choice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2990-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Immunoblot analysis of protein extracts obtained in step 49\nImmunoblot (IB) analysis following streptavidin affinity purification of potato (CE3027) leaf material transiently transfected with StCDF1-YFP-TurboID and YFP-YFP-TurboID, which was infiltrated with 10 μM of exogenous biotin 2 h before harvest, as well as an untreated control sample. Biotinylated proteins were immunoblotted by Streptavidin-HRP (left). StCDF1-YFP-TurboID and YFP-YFP-TurboID was immunoblotted by anti-TurboID antibody (right). The red arrows represent target proteins. Expected sizes of StCDF1-YFP-TurboID and YFP-YFP-TurboID proteins are 122.4 and 99.6 kDa, respectively. In addition to full length or partial bait protein, YFP (27 kDa) and TurboID (35 kDa) free tags should be also visualized by using corresponding antibodies. In this context, partial proteins due to degradation could also be present in the Western blot. Partial proteins are: YFP-V5 (27 kDa), YFP-V5-TurboID (63 kDa), V5-TurboID (36 kDa), V5-TurboID-HA (37 kDa) and TurboID-HA (36 kDa).\nIdentification of the biotinylated proteins by mass spectrometry\nTiming: 1–4 weeks\nThe enriched biotinylated proteins are sent to the MS facility and subsequently analyzed in a specific software for protein identification and statistical analysis.\nSend the samples from step 37 to the MS facility.\nNote: It might be required to store the sample in a specific buffer at a determined temperature before the samples are pre-processed for MS.",
    "Note: We sent our samples to MS facility in Biochemistry Department at WUR for LC-MS analysis.\nNote: MS facility in Biochemistry Department at WUR pre-processes the samples to perform LC-MS.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] The pre-processing involves cysteine reduction, tryptic digestion, and clean-up of the peptides. These steps can vary depending on the facility service.\nUse the appropriate software for statistical analysis of the results from the LC-MS.\nSelect the proteins of interest for further studies."
