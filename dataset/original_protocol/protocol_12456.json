    "1. Installing the Assessment\nInsert the assessment software into a computer that meets the requirements in the Equipment Table.\nIf the folder does not automatically open, go to \"My Computer\" and open the CD Drive\nDouble click \"NeuroCog.build.319\"\nDouble click \"Installer\"\nDouble click \"Setup.exe\"\nClick the \"Next\" button at the bottom of the setup screen\nClick \"Agree\" on the licensing agreement\nClick \"Next\"\nClick \"Next\"\nClick \"Install\"\nClick \"Finish\"\n2. Setting-up the Study Room\nInstall the assessment on a computer in a quiet room and free of distractions. Make sure that the subject does not have access to any materials that can be used to take notes.\n\t\nEnsure that the computer is at a table or desk at a comfortable sitting height. Place a wired mouse on the table with enough room for the subject to rest their arm in order to prevent fatigue.\nPlug in the external speakers prior to starting the program.\nSet up two chairs, one directly in front of the computer for the subject and one to the side and slightly behind the other chair for the administrator to sit in. A rater should be present at all times during the administration of the assessment.\nPrior to administering the assessment, set up the program.\n\t\nDouble Click on the icon labeled \"Play VRFCAT.\"\nIf this is a returning subject, enter in the previously created Patient ID and Password and click \"Confirm.\" If this is a new subject, click New Profile and then create a new Patient ID and Password for the subject and click \"Confirm.\"",
    "Type in the Site Number, select the subject's Date of Birth, type in the Age, select the subject's Handedness and Gender, type in the Rater Initials, select the Study,* and select the Visit*. Then click \"Confirm.\" NOTE: *These elements can be customized. Please see the assessment manual for further information.\n3. Administering the Assessment\nTo initiate the administration of the task, sit the subject down at the chair directly in front of the computer. If this is the subject's first time with the assessment, use the default Scenario: \"Tutorial\" and the default Mini Scenario: \"Apartment.\"\n\t\nIf this is not the subject's first time with the assessment select the appropriate test version from the Scenario drop down menu and click \"Confirm.\" Please note that the previous version the subject completed will have turned from green to red. This will help to ensure that the same version is not administered twice to a subject.\nA rater should remain present during the entire administration of the assessment. If the subject asks what they are supposed to be doing, direct the subject to click on the audio icon in the top left corner. If the subject stops paying attention or at any point looks away from the screen, redirect the subject back to the task.\nTake the necessary precautions to try to ensure that the subject will not need a break during the administration of the assessment, but in extreme circumstances, the assessment can be paused and continued at a later time. To do so, press the \"Esc\" key on the keyboard, and a menu labeled Game Paused will appear.",
    "In the event that the subject is taking a short break, simply click \"Main Menu,\" type in the Admin Code, \"admin,\" and click \"Yes.\" The assessment will then go back to the screen to select what Mini Scenario is needed to start the subject on when they return. All completed Mini Scenarios will have turned from green to red.\nIf the subject is unable to complete the entire version that day, and must come back another day, click \"Exit\" on the Game Paused menu, type in the Admin Code, \"admin,\" and click \"Yes.\" This will shut down the program. Once the subject returns, log back into the program with the correct Patient ID and password, and select the appropriate Scenario and Mini Scenario from the drop down menus. All completed Mini Scenarios will have turned from green to red.\nOnce the subject has completed all four Mini Scenarios (Apartment, Bus to Store, Store, and Bus to Apartment) a screen saying \"Congratulations! You have completed the task! Please let your test administrator know that you have finished,\" will appear. Click \"Continue,\" and on the next screen click \"Begin New Scenario.\"In the box labeled \"Admin Code\" type in \"admin\" and click \"Yes.\"\n\t\nIf the subject completed the test version instead of the tutorial, click \"Exit Application.\" In the box labeled \"Admin Code\" type in \"admin,\" click \"Yes,\" and the session is complete.\n\t\t\nSelect the appropriate test version from the Scenario drop down menu and click \"Confirm.\" NOTE: The Scenario labeled Tutorial should now have changed from green to red because the subject has completed the entire Scenario.",
    "Once the subject has completed all four Mini Scenarios a screen will appear that says, \"Congratulations! You have completed the task! Please let your test administrator know that you have finished.\" Click \"Continue,\" and on the next screen click \"Exit Application.\" In the box labeled \"Admin Code\" type in \"admin\" and click \"Yes,\" and the session is complete.\n4. Potential Deviations\nIf the subject attempts to complete any of the objectives out of order, remind them that they must complete the task described in the instructions at the top of the screen before moving onto the next task.\nIf the subject has used up all of their virtual change during the Tutorial scenario and is unable to complete the final objective, escape out of the game using the above listed methods to return to the Scenario selection menu. Encourage the subject to try to not to use up all of their coins during the early objectives, and readminster the entire tutorial.\n\t\nIf the subject has used up all of their virtual change during the any of the other scenarios and is unable to complete the final objective, escape out of the game using the above listed methods to return to the Scenario selection menu. This data point will be considered missing, and do not readminister any of the scenarios."
