    "Binding of NBD-labeled peptide to membranesThe binding constant of a peptide is calculated from a titration of lipid vesicles, either small-unilamellar vesicles (SUVs, 10-50 μm size) or large-unilamellar vesicles (LUVs, 50-100 μm size) into NBD-peptide solution. To achieve an accurate result, at least 20 points should be recorded for each curve. An accepted dilution factor of the peptide solution is up to 10% and therefore no more than 40 μl of vesicle solution should be added. All assays were performed in room temperature (22-24 °C).Dissolve NBD-peptide of the requested solution (such as DDW or PBS) to a final concentration of 0.1 μM (see Note 2). Each measurement uses 400 μl of peptide solution, therefore prepare 810 μl for two repetitions.Set the spectrophotometer to spectrum mode with excitation wavelength of 467 nm and emission wavelength of 500-600 nm. In our device, slits are usually set to 5-10 nm. Using wider slits will improve sensitivity but can increase background noise and therefore should be individually determined for each peptide. Add 400 μl peptide solution to a pre-cleaned cuvette (magnetic stirrer can be used) and read the signal output. Measure again every few minutes until no change is detected. This is the basal signal of the labeled peptide in the absence of membrane compounds.Add 1 μl from the LUVs suspension stock to the cuvette to reach an initial peptide/lipid ratio of 1:312 and read again. Calculation of ratio: 12.5 mM lipid is 12,500 μM that are being diluted 1:400 in a solution containing 0.1 μM peptide. Therefore, when 1 μl are added the ratio is 1:312 (12,500/401*10). When another 1 μl will be added the ratio will be 1: 622 and so on. Re-measure the signal intensity every 1 min until no change in the signal is detected.",
    "This will indicate that binding has reached equilibrium.Repeat step 1-d successively until no change in the peak maxima (around 530 nm) can be detected.Clean the cuvette by washing it three times with 70% (v/v) ethanol. Trace ethanol in the cuvette should be removed by rinsing with DDW. To account for background, the emissions of the vesicles alone at the same wavelength should be monitored and subtracted. Therefore, repeat steps 1-c~f using the same solvents but without dissolving peptide in it.Cell-wall permeability assayThe assay is designed to compare the ability of a given peptide to penetrate the cell wall of a given bacterial strain and interact with its membrane (Saar-Dover et al., 2012). The relative elevation in NBD emission should be calculated for each strain and compared. Grow you bacteria to an exponential stage, concentrate cells from the culture by centrifuging 5 ml at 1,300 x g), 3 min. Wash and re-centrifuge pallet twice with PBS. Adjust your bacterial suspension to OD600 nm = 4 in PBS. Dissolve NBD-peptide in PBS solution to a final concentration of 0.1-1 μM (use concentration that does not disrupt the cellular integrity, this can be determined separately using a SYTOX green assay (Saar-Dover et al., 2012). Set the spectrophotometer to kinetic mode with excitation wavelength of 467 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm. In our device, SLM-Aminco Bowman series 2-luminescence spectrophotometer, slits are usually set to 5-10 nm. Using wider slits will improve sensitivity but can increase background noise and therefore should be individually determined for each peptide. Add 400 μl peptide solution to a pre-cleaned cuvette (magnetic stirrer can be used) and read the signal output until it stabilizes. This is the basal signal of the labeled peptide in the absence of membrane compounds.",
    "Add 10 μl from the bacterial suspension to the cuvette. Track the change in signal intensity with time until equilibrium is reached. Clean the cuvette by washing it three times with 70% (v/v) ethanol. Trace ethanol in the cuvette should be removed by rinsing with DDW. To account for background, the emissions of bacteria alone at the same wavelength should be monitored and subtracted. Therefore, repeat steps 2-c~e using the same solvents but without dissolving peptide in it.The signal intensity can be affected by oligomerization of the labeled peptide over the bacterial surface and self-quenching (reduced intensity). We therefore assess the level of peptide oligomerization by repeating the experiment using Rhodamine labeled peptides. Rhodamine is highly sensitive to quenching but unlike NBD, its emission is not affected strongly by the polarity of its environment."
