    "Isolation of membrane vesicles (MVs)Grow bacterial strainsStreak each strain individually from frozen stocks or stab vials onto MRS agar plates. For anaerobic growth, place plates in an AnaeroJar jar with an AnaeroGen anaerobic gas generation sachet and anaerobic indicator added. Grow at 37°C for approximately 48 h or until individual colonies are visible.Inoculate a single bacterial colony into 3 ml MRS broth. Grow overnight at 37°C without shaking in an AnaeroJar as in the previous step.Add 1 ml from the primary culture to 50 ml MRS broth in a sterile 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. Grow overnight as in previous steps.Collect and filter supernatantTransfer the overnight culture into a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 5,000 × g for 30 min.Decant supernatant into a new tube and centrifuge again at 5,000 × g for 30 min.Repeat Step A2b once or twice more, until no cell pellet is visible on the sides or bottom of the tube after centrifugation. These additional centrifugation steps are not strictly required but make it easier to filter the supernatant in the following step.Pass the supernatant through a 0.45 µm filter. This may be done using a 30 ml syringe and syringe filter or using a vacuum apparatus with an appropriate filter for larger volumes of supernatant.Ultracentrifugation to isolate MVsTransfer 36 ml of the filtered supernatant to an ultracentrifuge tube and assemble into the rotor.Ultracentrifuge at 126,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4°C.Decant the supernatant (the pellet is often invisible).Add 1 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubate overnight at 4°C to resuspend the pellet.Note: If proceeding for gradient ultracentrifugation, resuspend in 150 μl of PBS-OptiPrep mixture instead (see Step A4a below).",
    "Gradient ultracentrifugation of MVsResuspend MV pellets in 150 µl of a PBS-OptiPrep mixture (45% v/v) and move the suspension to the bottom of a 5 ml ultracentrifuge tube.Make several 0.8 ml PBS-OptiPrep solutions of lower density (e.g., 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, and 10%) and sequentially cover the base layer containing MVs with layers of decreasing density. Avoid adding bubbles or disrupting previous layers as you add.After all layers have been added, allow the tube to settle for 1 h.Ultracentrifuge the gradient at 236,000 × g for 3 h in a Sorvall WX Ultra 90 centrifuge using an AH-650 rotor.Following centrifugation, gently sequentially remove and place 10 equal-volume (~500 μl) fractions into separate tubes.Assess the different density fractions for MV concentration, protein composition, and other characteristics using the methods described below.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4145/bioprotoc-11-17-4145-g003.jpgFigure 3. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) of Lactobacillus membrane vesicles. A. Representative frame taken from a NanoSight LM10 video of L. acidophilus MVs. MVs purified from an MRS culture were diluted 1:1,000 in PBS prior to NTA. Scale bar indicates 2 µm. B. Representative MV size distribution from NTA results, taken from an average obtained from three 60 s videos.MV characterizationNanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) to determine particle size distribution and concentrationDilute MVs in 1× PBS – make several serial dilutions such as 10×, 100×, and 1,000×. Detection of particles by the NTA software is best when there are 20-60 particles within the field of view; therefore, samples need to be diluted, and the optimal dilution for each sample may vary from one isolation to another.Using a 1 ml needle-less syringe, add the diluted sample to the NanoSight instrument chamber. Allow a moment for samples to settle and adjust microscope focus and camera settings to optimize clarity of particles in the camera field of view within the NTA 2.",
    "3 Nanoparticle Tracking and Analysis software. Data can be collected at room temperature.Capture data as triplicate readings of 60 s exposure at 30 frames per second, and analyze using auto particle detection and tracking parameters: detection threshold, pixel blur, minimum track length, and minimum expected particle size. A representative image of NTA of vesicles from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 53544 is shown in Figure 3. As NTA 2.3 does not automatically add scale bars to images, they can be added by converting pixels to µm by dividing pixels by 9.036 (when using a 30× objective).Dynamic light scattering (DLS) to measure MV size distributionDilute MV samples 10-fold in 0.1× PBS pH 7.4 and add to disposable DLS cuvettes.Carry out DLS analysis using ZetaSizer NanoSeries equipped with a HeNe laser source (λ = 633 nm) and analyze using Dispersion Technology Software. Carry out measurements at 25°C. For each sample, take the average of five runs of 10 s each for the autocorrelation function, and repeat this three to six times.Zeta Potential measurement to determine MV surface chargeDilute MV samples and load into disposable cuvettes as for DLS.Measure zeta potential using ZetaSizer NanoSeries equipped with a HeNe laser source (λ = 633 nm) with Dispersion Technology Software. Carry out measurements at 25°C in triplicate for each sample.SDS-PAGE for qualitative analysis of proteins contained in MVsPrepare samples: based on MV concentration as determined by NTA, take equal amounts of each MV sample in ≤15 μl volume in 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes. Adjust sample volumes to 15 μl using water or 1× PBS. (Volumes may be adjusted depending on the well capacity of SDS-PAGE gels to be used.",
    ")Add 5 μl (or required volume to result in 1× final concentration) of 4× Laemmli sample loading buffer to each sample, then denature sample proteins by boiling for 5 min, chilling on ice for 5 min, and centrifuging for 15 min at 16,000 × g in a benchtop centrifuge.Assemble a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN Vertical Electrophoresis cell according to the manufacturer’s instructions with a 4-15% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX pre-cast protein gel.Load denatured MV samples (supernatant only) into the gel and run at 200 V until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.Remove the gel from its casing and rinse briefly in water; then, stain in GelCodeTM Blue Stain Reagent, followed by destaining using water, to visualize MV protein bands. Figure 3 of Dean et al. (2019) may be referred to for an example of an SDS-PAGE gel of MVs from three LAB species.Shotgun Proteomics Analysis to identify protein contents of MVsSample preparationResuspend MV pellets with 10 ml of 10% n-propanol in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) buffer.Normalize sample protein concentration using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit.Digest samples (50 µg) in solution with sequencing-grade modified trypsin at a 1:50 (w/w) enzyme:substrate ratio in a barocycler for 90 min (90 cycles: 50 s on at 45 kpsi, 10 s off).Evaporate digested samples via speed-vac and store at -20°C until analysis by LC-MS/MS.LC-MS/MSReconstitute dried samples in 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and load 3 μg digested protein onto a reversed-phase C18 column by a Dionex Ultimate WPS-3000 autosampler connected to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos equipped with a Nanospray Flex Ion Source in data-dependent acquisition mode.Separate peptides across a 90 min gradient of 2-60% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system.",
