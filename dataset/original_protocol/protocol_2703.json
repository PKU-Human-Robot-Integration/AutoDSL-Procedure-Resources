Maintain the tube submerged for 1 min to ensure complete freezing.\nRemove the conical tubes from the dry ice-ethanol bath and allow them to thaw at ambient temperature or by gentle warming with your hands.\nOnce lysates have thawed, re-submerge each tube in the dry ice-ethanol bath, and repeat this freeze-thaw process for three cycles in total.\nExtract protein from cell lysate and determine protein concentration.\nCentrifuge the conical tubes at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nPool the supernatants by transferring into a single 15 mL conical tube.\nDetermine protein concentration by BCA assay.\nAliquot supernatants into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store at −80°C.\nCritical: Wear gloves and be sure to not contact dry ice or ethanol with skin as both can cause serious freezing injury.\nAlternatives: Cells can be mechanically lysed by liquid nitrogen freeze-thaw, or with shearing cells through a 23 g needle. We advise against the use of detergents or sonication in order to ensure maintenance of the native configuration of soluble proteins. If using liquid nitrogen, be sure to use safety goggles to protect from eye injury.\nTreat protein lysates and temperature challenge",
    "Timing: 3 h\nThis step involves the incubation of protein lysates with the compound and subsequent temperature challenge. Proteins which are in contact with a small molecule will typically exhibit ligand-induced thermal stabilization, a well-established biophysical concept.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nThaw samples on ice and aliquot 1.2 mg of protein lysate into four 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and dilute to 1.2 mL with PBS to achieve a protein concentration of 1 mg/mL.\nTreat lysates with approximately the small molecule EC80 or vehicle control, in duplicate. We solubilize LCS3 in DMSO and use 0.1% DMSO as a vehicle control.\nGently pulse vortex the samples and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. After the 20 min incubation, put treated lysates on ice.\nGently pulse vortex samples again and aliquot each lysate sample into 11 × 0.2 mL PCR tube aliquots of 100 μL as shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2358_1.csv\nCritical: The next section describes the temperature challenge, which is a crucial series of steps. If using a thermal cycler with a trusted gradient setting, all samples can undergo temperature challenge simultaneously using the gradient heat setting. However, the accuracy of thermal cycler gradient is dependent on the heating and cooling elements of the thermal block, and measured thermal profiles have been reported to not reflect gradient settings.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] Due to this uncertainty, we instead ran each temperature condition on the thermal cycler alone on a static heating temperature setting, without gradient. Thus, for our heating method it is rational to aliquot the samples into PCR tubes grouped according to temperature. Grouping samples in this manner also minimizes the risk that samples of a same temperature are handled unequally.",
    "Note: If using a dry ice-ethanol bath, the ethanol can remove permanent marker ink used for labeling. Consider using an ethanol-resistant permanent marker for labeling the PCR tubes. The temperature challenge step is best accomplished by two persons working together in an ‘assembly line’ as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nPerform temperature challenge. The organization we used for this setup is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2358-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Organization for temperature challenge incubations\nSet thermal cycler to 37°C and place samples 1, 12, 23, 34 on the thermal block and set timer for 3 min.\nRemove samples from thermal cycler and place samples in a room temperature water bath for 3 min.\nSnap freeze samples in a dry ice-ethanol bath and then incubate on dry ice.\nIncrease thermal cycler to next in sequence temperature and repeat sample heating, water bath incubation, and snap freezing for 41, 44, 47, 50, 53, 56, 59, 63, 67°C groups. Snap freeze the ‘No heat’ samples (11, 22, 33, 44) without heating.\nPause point: The protocol can be paused here by storing the samples at −80°C indefinitely.\nIsolate soluble protein fractions\nTiming: 2 h\nThaw samples on ice and transfer to 200 μL thickwall polycarbonate centrifuge tubes that fit the TLA-100 rotor.\nUltracentrifuge samples.\nPlace centrifuge tubes (samples 1–10, 12–21) into rotor cavity and insert rotor into ultracentrifuge.\nCentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nRemove the rotor and transfer centrifuge tubes onto the tube stand.\nCarefully pipette 90 μL of lysate carefully from the surface as to not capture denatured proteins pelleted by ultracentrifugation. The lysate should be transferred into 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.\nRepeat ultracentrifugation steps with samples 23–32, 34–43.",
    "Critical: Be sure to properly balance the ultracentrifuge to reduce the risk of instrument damage or bodily harm during the 100,000 × g ultracentrifugation.\nPause point: The protocol can be paused here by storing the samples at −80°C indefinitely.\nReduce, alkylate, and digest proteins\nTiming: 24 h\nPrepare reagents for protein reduction and alkylation.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nPrepare 200 mM HEPES and adjust to pH 8.0 using 2 N NaOH in water.\nPrepare 200 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 200 mM HEPES.\nPrepare 400 mM of fresh iodoacetamide (IAA) in 200 mM HEPES.\nCritical: DTT and IAA are oxygen-sensitive and light-sensitive, respectively, and should be prepared immediately before use.\nReduce and alkylate proteins.\nAdd 5 μL of 200 mM DTT to each sample and incubate for 30 min at 55°C in a thermomixer.\nAdd 10 μL of 400 mM IAA to each sample and incubate for 30 min at room temperature while wrapped in aluminum foil or in a dark area.\nAdd 5 μL 200 mM DTT to each sample to quench the alkylation reaction.\nDigest proteins.\nResuspend lyophilized Trypsin/Lys-C immediately before use by adding 200 μL of 200 mM HEPES pH 8.0 into each vial of 20 μg Trypsin/Lys-C (concentration: 0.1 μg/μL).\nPrepare a digestion solution by adding resuspended Trypsin/Lys-C to 200 mM HEPES pH 8.0 to a concentration of 5 μg/mL with enough volume to add 400 μL to each sample.\nNote: For an experiment with 44 samples at this step, 17.6 mL volume is be needed and we recommend preparing a 19 mL digestion solution containing 95 μg Trypsin/Lys-C (950 μL of resuspended Typsin/Lys-C mix).",
    "Add 400 μL of digestion solution to each sample to achieve approximately a 1:50 enzyme:protein ratio (2 μg of trypsin to approximately 100 μg of protein in each sample based on the 1.2 mg per 1.2 mL starting amount) and a dilution of approximately 1:5.\nDigest proteins for 16 h at 37°C in on a thermomixer.\nPause point: The protocol can be paused here by storing the samples at −80°C indefinitely.\nQuality check peptides by mass spectrometry\nTiming: 48 h\nAs a quality check (QC) for the protein digest, transfer approximately 10% (v/v) of each sample (50 μL) into new 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and add 5 μL of 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to each tube.\nDesalt peptide QC samples using Stop And Go Extraction (STAGE) tip protocol15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] or a comparable desalting method.\nSpeed vacuum peptides to dryness and reconstitute in 15 μL of water.\nDetermine the approximate peptide concentration by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.\nAcidify the reconstituted peptides to 1% (v/v) formic acid and inject approximately 200 ng for MS analysis on a LTQ Orbitrap Velos™ or similar mass spectrometer to assess sample quality.\nNote: Users should observe a typical peptide chromatographic elution profile with a multitude of resolved peaks, and an abundance of multiply charged precursor masses (z = 2–4+) in acquired MS1 spectra.\nNote: Our mass spectrometer for QC is equipped with a 75 μm internal diameter column and therefore a 200 ng injection amount is appropriate. If the dimensions of the user’s system setup are different, the injection amount should be scaled up or down to achieve an appropriate on-column loading quantity.\nTMT label peptides\nTiming: 3 h",
    "Described below are the steps for TMT labeling peptides. We use an 11-plex TMT set, such that the 11th channel (TMT11-131C) contains an untreated H23 lysate mix that is not subjected to temperature challenge or ultracentrifugation, to enhance the discovery of underrepresented peptides. The 11 samples of each treatment condition should be multiplexed in a single 11-plex TMT set.\nPrepare reagents for TMT labeling.\nReconstitute lyophilized TMT reagent by adding 500 μL of acetonitrile to each 5 mg TMT reagent tube (10 μg/μL).\nPrepare 10 mL of 1 M glycine. Store at 4°C after use.\nTMT-label the samples.\nAdd sufficient TMT reagent to achieve a minimum ratio of 2:1 for TMT:peptide (μg:μg) to each sample based on the total concentration of peptide in your sample as determined as part of the QC procedure in step 17. Pulse vortex samples and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nRepeat the labeling step once more to ensure complete labeling.\nAdd 15 μL 1 M glycine to each sample to quench the TMT reagent and then pulse vortex. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min to ensure complete quenching.\nSpeed vacuum samples to dryness to ensure removal of acetonitrile.\nReconstitute the first TMT-labeled sample in 1 mL water by pipetting. Transfer this 1 mL of solution to the next TMT-labeled sample (do not discard the tube) and reconstitute by pipetting. Repeat for all remaining samples to pool all 11 TMT-labeled samples into a single 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: During peptide reconstitution by pipette, some volume can be lost to the sides of the tube. To minimize sample loss, centrifuge all the reconstituted sample tubes for 1 min at 10,000 × g and recover the liquid to the final 1 mL of reconstituted solution.",
    "Note: After TMT labeling, TMT reagent tube lids should be enclosed in parafilm and stored at −80°C, while taking care to ensure proper sealing of the tube lids. We have observed stability in the TMT reagent across multiple freeze-thaw cycles and months in storage.\nPause point: The protocol can be paused here by storing the samples at −80°C indefinitely.\nFractionate peptides by offline high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\nTiming: 48 h\nTo reduce the complexity of the TMT labeled mixture to increase overall proteome coverage, we prepare peptides with a fractionation-concatenation scheme prior to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Below are the steps for offline fractionation of peptides with an Agilent 1100 series HPLC. If using an alternative HPLC, users should consult manufacturer’s instructions for that instrument. We perform peptide fractionation using a gradient of acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, with an Agilent Poroshell HPH-C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm) designed for stability in high pH conditions. Each set of TMT-labeled samples is separated into 48 fractions and concatenated into a final set of 12.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]\nAcidify all four TMT labeled and pooled samples to pH < 3 by diluting a 10% (v/v) solution of TFA to 1% (v/v) in each sample.\nDesalt TMT-labeled peptides using a 50 mg C18 SepPak as follows:\nDesalt the TMT-labeled peptides using a tC18 50 mg SepPak or equivalent (e.g., TopTip, Strata-X column) on a vacuum manifold.\nPrecondition the column using two sequential loadings each of 1 mL of acetonitrile + 0.1% TFA and 1 mL of water + 0.1% TFA.\nLoad the sample and rinse three times with 1 mL of water + 0.1% formic acid.\nElute twice into the same collection tube using 600 μL of 60% acetonitrile so that the final elution volume is 1.2 mL.",
    "Note: The vacuum should be set to provide a flow rate of approximately 1 drop per second.\nSpeed vacuum the desalted TMT-labeled peptide solution to dryness.\nReconstitute dried TMT-labeled peptides in 100 μL water and measure the concentration using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer or alternative assay. Dilute your sample to a concentration of 20 μg/μL and add bring to approximately pH 8 by adding 10% (v/v) of a 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution.\nNote: Reconstitute lyophilized peptides in a volume appropriate for injection to your HPLC system. A good rule of thumb is to reconstitute your sample in a maximum total volume corresponding to the capacity of your HPLC injection loop.\nNote: On system start-up and prior to injection, system performance should be verified using an appropriate standard. On our system, we use an on-column injection of 10 μg of a tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin, assessing peak elution reproducibility across the history of the column.\nVortex, centrifuge samples at 20,000 × g for 1 min to pellet any particulate and transfer the supernatant to a sample vial appropriate for injection on the HPLC system taking care to not transfer any pelleted material.\nFractionate samples by HPLC.\nConfigure your system with a mobile phase A of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate in water (pH 8), and mobile phase B of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 80% acetonitrile.\nProgram the HPLC to inject at least 100 μg of peptide sample onto the column and fractionate using a gradient running from 5% – 45% acetonitrile with collection of 48 fractions into a 96-well plate across the appropriate elution window.\nCollect fractions from HPLC using a 96-well plate.",
    "Concatenate the 48 fractions into 12 by pooling equal-interval HPLC fractions (i.e., fraction 1 = A1 + B1 + C1 + D1; fraction 2 = A2 + B2 + C2 + D2, etc.).\nNote: The appropriate elution window will depend on the chosen column and HPLC system dead volume. Determining the appropriate elution window will require optimization for each HPLC system.\nPause point: The protocol can be paused here by storing the samples at −80°C indefinitely.\nLC-MS\nTiming: 8 d\nBelow are the steps for running fractionated, TMT-labeled peptides on an Orbitrap Fusion™ or similar mass spectrometer using a standard tandem MS/MS acquisition method. An example method containing the complete mass spectrometer parameters is provided in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2358-Mmc1.xlsx]. This method is provided as a guideline, and users should always optimize parameters to provide the optimal results with their own MS system. For sample injection, our nanoflow ultra-high performance HPLC (nano-UHPLC) system uses a direct on-column injection setup (i.e., no trap column) with an analytical column 25 cm in length, prepared in-house and packed with 3 μm C18 beads. The injection and acquisition routine is controlled using Thermo XCalibur (v3.0 or greater) software.\nNote: The mass spectrometer should be optimized and calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications. Performance of the nano-UHPLC chromatography columns and MS performance should be verified using an appropriate standard. On our system, we use a tryptic digest of BSA to monitor peak elution performance over the lifetime of the chromatography column, and a tryptic digest of a whole cell lysate to ensure optimal operation of the mass spectrometer (e.g., peptide signal, MS/MS identification rate).\nSpeed vacuum the peptide fractions from HPLC to dryness.",
    "Reconstitute dried peptides in a volume of 1% formic acid, 1% DMSO appropriate for your nano-UHPLC system configuration and column loading capacity based on the amount of starting material used during HPLC fractionation. A good rule of thumb for a 75 μm internal diameter column is to aim for a final concentration of 200 ng/μL.\nLoad the peptide sample into a 96-well plate and cover with a silicone Axymat.\nProgram the nano-UHPLC to inject 1 μL of the reconstituted peptides on-column, and gradient elute the peptides with a 2-h ramp of water + 0.1% formic acid (buffer A) and 80% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid (buffer B) (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2358_2.csv\nConfigure the MS to perform tandem MS/MS acquisition of eluted peptides, ensuring the use of parameters appropriate for TMT reporter ion observation (i.e., MS/MS acquisition in a high-resolution analyzer, such as the Orbitrap).\nNote: An example method describing data-dependent acquisition with MS1 and MS/MS scanning with the Orbitrap mass analyzer is provided in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2358-Mmc1.xlsx].\nMobile phase A: Water, 0.1% formic acid.\nMobile phase B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid.\nNote: After drawing sample into the sample loop, sufficient volume should be flowed to move the peptides to the column front. The required volume will depend on the nano-UHPLC system configuration in your lab. On our system, we maintain sample injection volumes at <4 μL, and load by flowing a total volume of 10 μL through the sample loop at a maximum pressure of 400 bar. The nano-UHPLC flow rates and elution conditions will depend on the dimensions of the analytical column used and the capabilities of each system. On our column step, we use a flow rate of 425 nL/min, which provides a consistent operation at a pressure of ∼300 bar.\nAnalyze mass spectrometry data\nTiming: 2 d",
    "The steps below describe how to analyze the TPP mass spectrometry data. Our code is available, which integrates the original TPP code,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] the NPARC analysis code,9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] and contains alternate graphics settings for generating denaturation curves. Our code can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7294843[href=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7294843].\nNote: We recommend downloading the open source NPARC R package because it contains a comprehensive walkthrough of the NPARC workflow, data preprocessing, function definition and NPARC model fitting.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] Our justification to use NPARC analysis in lieu of the original TPP analysis is outlined in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nUse Proteome Discoverer or a comparable proteomics software package such as MaxQuant or FragPipe to identify and quantify proteins in the raw MS spectra files using standard data processing protocols.\nNote: In Proteome Discoverer, example processing and consensus workflows that are appropriate for high-resolution MS/MS data are provided with the software and can be used with only minor modifications to the default settings.\nNote: Based on the above-described MS acquisition method in which we utilize the Orbitrap analyzer to acquire both the MS1 survey and MS2 fragment ion scans, we recommend the use of 20 parts-per-million (ppm) mass accuracy settings for both precursor and fragment ion tolerance settings. To ensure peptide identification, an appropriate protein sequence database should be acquired from a standard repository, such as UniProt, enzyme specificity classified as trypsin with one allowed missed cleavage, fixed modification masses of +57.02146@C, and variable modification masses of +15.9949@M, +229.16293@K, and +229.16293@peptide N-terminus.

The NPARC FDR-adjusted p-value is a method to prioritize proteins for follow-up studies, but visual examination of denaturation curves can yield additional information. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows denaturation curves from two validated hits (TXNRD1 and GSR), and three hits that were not validated (DNAJC9, NCAPD3, SAP130). As an example, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows that both GSR and DNAJC9 have comparatively similar –log adjusted p-values (4.9 and 4.5, respectively). However, the goodness-of-fit of each GSR sample nonlinear regression line is much greater than that of DNAJC9. Furthermore, the GSR replicates are much closer in agreement than DNAJC9. Lastly, the DNAJC9 vehicle replicate lines do not reflect a discernible pattern. Thus, while subjective, it is important to visually inspect all significant denaturation curves for robust characteristics such as goodness-of-fit, agreement between replicates, and pattern.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2358-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
