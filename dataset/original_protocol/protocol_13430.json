  "procedures": [
    "All experiments were approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were performed following the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. A total of 12 Royal College of Surgeon (RCS) male rats were used in the present study. Animals were bred in the animal facility and included in the study once they reached the age of 28 ± 1 days postnatal. A complete eye exam was performed to verify the lack of eye abnormalities. The subretinal implants, ultrathin membranes made from Parylene C and coated with vitronectin, were designed by a specific commercial organization (see Table of Materials). These membranes replicate human-size membranes in terms of their thickness and permeability (6.0 µm thickness mesh frame with 20 µm circular pores in the ultrathin areas). Miniaturizing the length and width (1.0 mm × 0.4 mm) from human-size membranes was achieved to accommodate the subretinal implants inside the rodent eyes18.\n1. Animal care and surgical preparation\nWeigh the animal to calculate the dosage of anesthesia and anesthetize following step 1.2.\nAnesthetize the animal through intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (35-50 mg/kg and 5-10 mg/kg, respectively; see Table of Materials). Inject with a 1.0 mL syringe and 30 G needle.\nLoad another 1.0 mL syringe with half the amount of the mixture of the anesthesia (ketamine and xylazine) to maintain the proper level of anesthesia during the procedure.\nConfirm adequate anesthesia by the absence of a pedal reflex (firm toe pinch).",
    "To properly visualize the vitreous cavity and retina, dilate the pupil by the instillation of 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine eye drops (see Table of Materials) in the treated eye.\n\t\nApply a second dose of dilation eye drops after 5 min.\nApply either artificial tears or ocular lubricant gel in the non-surgical eye every 5-10 min while the animal is anesthetized to moisturize the cornea.\nPlace a sterile drape over the heating pad (see Table of Materials). Place a sterile drape covering the surgical tray.\nPrepare the sterile surgical area by placing the following sterile instruments on the surgical tray: surgical gloves, subretinal implant, and surgical tools: mosquito forceps (3), microsurgical fine scissors (1), needle holder (1), fine forceps with teeth (1), fine straight forceps without teeth (2), microliter syringe (1), 32 G blunt needle (1), 27 G or 30 G needle (2), 4-0 silk suture (3), cotton swabs, balanced salt solution (BSS), and a cover slip (see Table of Materials).\nUnder sterile conditions and using sterile gloves, load the microliter syringe with the BSS and attach the 32 G blunt needle.\nInsert the cotton swap into the 27 G or 30 G needle hub to create a handle for more sensitive manipulation of the needle.\nTo maintain sterile conditions throughout the procedure, change the sterile gloves if non-sterile instruments or areas are manipulated, such as the surgical microscope.\n2. Scleral approach for subretinal implantation: surgical technique\nExpose the surgical area following the steps below.\n\t\nOnce the animal is under anesthesia and the pupil is dilated (step 1.5), place the animal belly-side down with the head toward the researcher.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the rat on the heating pad covered with a sterile drape during the entire surgery and until the animal is fully recovered.",
    "Apply 5% povidone drops (see Table of Materials) onto the eye and clean the eye surface and eyelids with cotton swabs.\nPlace and adjust the surgical microscope (see Table of Materials) over the surgical eye.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to use a surgical ophthalmic microscope throughout the entire surgical procedure to get a sharper and larger visualization of the ocular structures.\nEnsure proper exposure of the surgical area by lifting the superior eyelid and protruding the eyeball using 4-0 non-absorbable sutures.\n\t\t\nElevate the superior eyelid using a 4-0 silk suture. Place the suture in the anterior side of the eyelids at the level of the meibomian glands. Secure the tractional suture by clamping mosquito forceps to the surgical surface.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the suture is placed higher than the level of the meibomian gland, eversion of the eyelid will occur instead of eyelid elevation.\nPerform peritomy of the temporal superior quadrant using microsurgical fine scissors.\nPlace two tractional sutures to allow protrusion and forward displacement of the eyeball. Perform isolation of the superior rectus muscle.\n\t\t\t\nThrough gentle manipulation of the eye with fine teeth forceps (0.12 mm forceps) in the superior aspect of the limbus, roll the eye down to expose the sclera.\nPlace a 4-0 silk suture behind the superior limbus up to 1 mm away, which is the location of the superior extraocular muscle. Clamp both tails of the suture by using mosquito forceps.\nPerform temporal rectus muscle isolation. Place a second suture (4-0 silk) up to 1 mm away from the limbus in the temporal quadrant (at the corresponding area of the temporal extraocular muscle). Clamp both tails of the suture by using mosquito forceps.",
    "Once both extraocular muscle sutures are properly placed and clamped, pull the sutures down and inward to expose the temporal superior quadrant of the sclera.\nExtend the peritomy toward the back of the eye with microsurgical fine scissors.\nControl conjunctival bleeding by using cotton swabs.\nPerform scleral incision, retinal detachment (RD), and implant insertion following the steps below.\n\t\nPerform scleral incision by using a 27 G or 30 G needle. Ensure that the size of the incision is ~1.2 mm and is 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus.\n\t\tNOTE: Development of a tunnel-like scleral incision configuration is recommended to stabilize intraocular structures while manipulating the eye and introducing the implant. This incision shape will prevent sudden fluctuations in intraocular pressure.\nSometimes, proper configuration requires practice. Therefore, if proper configuration is not achieved, release some tension from the extraocular muscle tractional sutures to facilitate keeping the ocular structures inside of the vitreous cavity.\nBy using the same needle used for the scleral incision (27 G or 30 G), perform paracentesis in the peripheral cornea at the same quadrant.\nInsert the 32 G blunt needle mounted on a microliter syringe through the scleral incision.\nInject 100 µL of BSS to create a focal RD.\nRelease the extraocular muscle tractional sutures to get the eye back into the regular position.\nFor direct visualization of the RD, rest and hold the cover slip, loaded with ophthalmic lubricant gel, onto the cornea.\nAdjust the microscope objective to focus on the retina.\nIf the RD is not observed or is too small (smaller than the size of one quadrant), perform a second injection of BSS to achieve the desired RD size by rolling the eye down and inward and repeating steps 2.2.4 to 2.2.8.",
    "Once the RD is completed, verify the scleral length (as mentioned in step 2.2.1) with a caliper (see Table of Materials).\nCut the choroidal tissue in both directions with fine microsurgical scissors.\nRun the blunt needle sideways along the scleral incision to verify all scleral and choroidal structures have been dissected.\nInsert the implant into the subretinal space.\nUsing two fine surgical forceps, such as tying forceps (see Table of Materials), grab the implant from the back so as not to damage the active part of the implant.\nPlace the implant parallel to the incision plane and gently slide in the implant.\nOnce the implant is completely introduced in the subretinal space, release it, and push the implant further in by introducing the jaws of one of the forceps 1-1.5 mm into the incision.\nRelease the extraocular muscle tractional sutures and verify the placement of the implant by using the microscope and the coverslip as described above (steps 2.2.7 and 2.2.8).\nRelease and remove all the sutures.\n\t​NOTE: After concluding the surgical procedure, SD-OCT is performed (step 3) to validate the clinical findings. The SD-OCT imaging session is conducted right after the surgery. If proper visualization of the implant location was not obtained, then conduct the SD-OCT again 7-10 days post-surgery.\n3. SD-OCT imaging\nClick on the Heidelberg Eye Explorer icon (an image management software; see Table of Materials) on the desktop screen.\nClick on the New Patient icon at the top of the screen.\n\t\nComplete all information requested to generate the animal ID and click on Accept.\nSelect the OCT imaging system (HRA + OCT; see Table of Materials) for the device type.\nSelect the operator and press OK.\nFor the correct cornea curvature option, press the OK button to accept default eye data.",
    "Ensure that the SD-OCT acquisition window is launched and ready for SD-OCT.\nTurn on the SD-OCT camera by pressing the yellow Start button located on the touchscreen display next to the camera.\nPlace the animal on the SD-OCT animal stage that has been adapted on top of the SD-OCT headrest.\n\tNOTE: The animal stage adaptation includes a piece of polystyrene foam (see Table of Materials) to fit within the SD-OCT head stage that is large enough to place the animal on, including the heating pad.\nAdjust the table height and animal position to align the pupil with the center of the SD-OCT lens.\n\tNOTE: Once the eye is aligned, an infrared (IR) live image will appear on the screen.\nPress either the IR + OCT button on the touch screen or the OCT button at the bottom right of the monitor to start the image acquisition.\nOnce the SD-OCT goes live, select a single scan mode with the highest number (100) of ART frames. The 100 ART scan mode is the default mode.\nUsing the camera joystick, center the optic nerve on the IR image.\nPush the camera forward until the IR image is evenly filled with the retinal image.\n\tNOTE: Dark corners indicate the camera is either too far or close to the eye.\nMove the camera sideways until the implant is visualized in the temporal aspect of the retina. Use the IR image to guide the movements.\nTo visualize the implant by the B-scan, press CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + O simultaneously to display the SD-OCT B-scan adjustment window.\nAdjust the \"Reference Arm\" (at the bottom of the window) until the retina/implant is visualized in the SD-OCT image.\n\t​NOTE: The SD-OCT image must be displayed within the blue reference corners.\nClose the window.",
    "By using the joystick and the camera handle, slide and rotate the camera in all directions until a better, flatter, and sharper SD-OCT quality image is obtained.\nDrag the blue arrow on the IR image until it is placed along the implant.\nOnce the saturation and placement of the B-scan are optimal, activate the \"Automatic Real-time Tracking (ART)\" by pressing the black Gain Control button below the touch screen.\nOnce the ART reaches 100 frames, press Acquire on the touch screen.\nWhen all images have been acquired, click on Save Images on the top of the window and then click on Exit.\nKeep the cornea moist during the entire imaging session by applying lubricant eye drops frequently (every 5 min).\n4. Animal recovery\nAt the end of the imaging session, apply antibiotic ointment to the cornea to prevent ocular infection and moisturize the cornea.\nKeep the animal resting on its belly on the heating pad until fully recovered (~20-30 min) and ambulatory.\nGive systemic analgesics (1.0-1.2 mg/kg Buprenorphine SR once subcutaneous; see Table of Materials) at the end of the surgical procedure.\nDo not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness.\nDo not return the animal to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nOnce fully recovered, place the animal back into the housing area with access to food and water ad libitum.\nSubscription Required.
