    "Experimental preparationWaterNote: Molecular biology grade water was used for all procedures, including the washing of microscope slides and coverslips.Microscope slides and coverslipsTo fully submerge the slides and coverslips in their racks, sufficient water was warmed to ~40 °C in a microwave, then the detergent decon90 (Decon Laboratories Limited, Sussex, UK) was added to 3% (v/v). In their racks, slides and coverslips were dipped up and down 10 times in the detergent solution to help dislodge surface contaminants, then left to soak for ~7 h. After dipping up and down a further 5 times, the solution was discarded and the glassware rinsed once with water as follows: sufficient water was added to the container to fully submerge glassware which was then dipped up and down 10 times. Fresh 3% (v/v) decon90 solution was made up, and the glassware left to soak in this for at least 12 h. Glassware was then thoroughly rinsed at least 5 times in water, then placed in an oven at 60 °C until dry. Once dry, slides and coverslips were stored in covered boxes to prevent dust contamination.Silica beadsA suspension containing 5 micron silica beads was prepared for addition to assay mixtures prior to mounting. The beads acted as a spacer between the slide and the coverslip. A small amount of bead powder (~5 μl dry volume) was deposited in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube to which 500 μl of 150 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 was added.The beads were distributed in this buffer by vigorous vortexing followed by 30 sec agitation in a sonicating water bath (power 35 W, intensity 44 kHz)–this was repeated once more to make the beads become mono-dispersed.",
    "A bead density was required such that 1 μl of this suspension added to a 25 μl assay mixture would provide ~1-2 beads per field of view when 3 μl of the mixture was mounted and viewed under the 63x objective. Therefore, when a new stock of beads was made, the bead density was tested by mixing 1 μl of the stock with 25 μl water and mounting 3 μl of this suspension as described below and viewing under a microscope. If the number of beads was too low, the bead stock was briefly spun down and enough buffer removed to increase bead density when resuspended. More buffer could be added to the bead stock for the opposite effect.Mammalian cell cultureWild type and HEK293 cell clones stably expressing GalT-XFP constructs (Cottam et al., 2014) were used. These were generated by stable transfection of a pCR3.1 vector (Invitrogen) based plasmid containing human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 with a CFP or a YFP tag, and selection with 800 µg/ml Geneticin (GibcoTM). Single cell-derived clones were selected for use if the expressed GalT-XFP was found localized in the Golgi only, rather than partly distributed in cytosolic puncta. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM GlutaMAX-I, and 100 U of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin per ml. Most other cell lines were cultured in the same media, although CHO lines needed Ham’s F12 media supplemented with 5% FBS and the same antibiotics composition as for HEK cell culture. All cell lines were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Golgi membranesThe following method is adapted from Balch et al. (1984). Typically, two T175 flasks (each 175 cm2) of stably expressing GalT-CFP HEK cells (Cottam et al.",
    ", 2014) were grown to a confluent monolayer (~7-10 x 107 cells total), harvested, and washed twice in 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The cell pellet (~500-600 μl) was resuspended in four times the pellet volume using the same 0.25 M sucrose buffer. The suspension was treated with 25 strokes in a 1 ml tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C for later subcellular fractionation.Golgi membranes were isolated from homogenates by floatation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient by centrifugation. Frozen homogenates were rapidly thawed at 37 °C and then maintained on ice. The sucrose concentration of the homogenate was adjusted to 1.4 M by adding ice-cold 2.3 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 at a volume of 1.28-fold to the homogenate volume, and mixed thoroughly by pipetting with a 10 ml serological pipette. The mixture was loaded into an SW41 tube to form the bottom layer and then overlaid with 4.94 ml of 1.2 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. These two layers were then overlaid with enough 0.8 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 to fill the tube to its maximum capacity of 12 ml (between 2.5 ml and 3 ml depending on the volume of the bottom layer). The gradient was then centrifuged for 80 min at 39,000 rpm, 4 °C in an SW41 rotor. In a cold room, the turbid band at the 1.2/0.8 M sucrose interface was then drawn off in a minimum volume (~700-800 μl) by manual pipetting from the top of the gradient downwards. This fraction was mixed well, aliquoted into 20 μl volumes in PCR tubes, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.",
    "The sucrose concentration of the final sample was measured using a 0-50% sugar refractometer (Bellingham and Stanley Ltd, UK). The sucrose concentration was always very close to and slightly above 1 M. In the assay, 1 μl from a stock of Golgi isolated in the above fashion gave ~32 particles per field of view by EMCCD imaging.VesiclesThe following method is adapted from Love et al. (1998). Typically, four T175 flasks of stably expressing GalT-YFP HEK cells were grown to a confluent monolayer (~14-20 x 107 cells total), harvested, and washed once in PBS and then in 0.2 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.2. The pellet (~1 ml) was resuspended in four times the pellet volume using the same 0.2 M sucrose buffer, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C until needed. Vesicle membranes were isolated by floatation on a discontinuous gradient of Optiprep density gradient media by centrifugation. Frozen cell suspensions were gradually thawed in a water bath at 21 °C. This caused permeabilization of cells by membrane fracture. The cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C, which left vesicles in the supernatant. This supernatant was centrifuged once more for 5 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C then twice more for 20 min at 20,000 x g, 4 °C to remove all debris and large cellular membranes. Vesicles in the supernatant were then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 55,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C in a TLA 100.3 rotor. The vesicle pellet (typically ~30 μl) was resuspended in KHM buffer (see Recipes) to a volume of 320 μl. This 320 μl was mixed with 480 μl of 50% Optiprep in HM buffer (see Recipes).",
    "The mixture was transferred to a TLS-55 tube and overlayed with 800 μl of 25% Optiprep in KHM buffer and then with 400 μl of 10% Optiprep in KHM buffer. Vesicles were floated to the 10%/25% interface by ultracentrifugation at 55,000 rpm for 3 h 10 min at 4 °C in a TLS-55 rotor. The turbid band at the interface was harvested by manual pipetting in a minimum volume of typically 300-400 μl and mixed well. 10-15 μl aliquots were made into PCR tubes which were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. In the assay, 1 μl from a stock of vesicles isolated in the above fashion gave ~150-250 particles per field of view by EMCCD imaging.A larger, more concentrated batch of vesicles was produced for studies requiring cytosol dependence by using a scaled-up version of the above method. ~3.5 x 109 GalT-YFP HEK cells were harvested. The Optiprep gradient was increased 6.25 times to 12.5 ml total volume in an SW41 tube, then ultracentrifuged at 41,000 rpm for 8 h at 4 °C. 250 μl fractions were manually drawn off the gradient by pipetting. Western blot analysis of the fractions (using an α-HA antibody against an HA tag in the GalT-YFP construct for detection) showed six consecutive fractions around the 10%/25% interface region which had the highest signal (indicating vesicles). These fractions were pooled (1.5 ml total), aliquoted and flash frozen as above. 1 μl from this concentrated stock of vesicles in the assay gave ~1,000-1,500 particles per field of view by EMCCD imaging.CytosolThe method for cytosol preparation was adapted from (Balch et al., 1984). Four T175 flasks of cells were grown to full confluency (~14-20 x 107 HEK293 cells in total). Cells were trypsinized using trypsin-PBS buffer, then washed 4 times with PBS before washing twice in ice-cold 0.",
    "25 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of the same buffer with fresh DTT added to 1 mM from a 1 M aqueous stock.The suspension was treated with 30 strokes in a 1 ml tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was transferred to a TLA 100.3 ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged again in the same way to remove all cell debris. Meanwhile, a PD-10 desalting column was equilibrated with 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. The cleared cytosol supernatant was added to the column. The desalted cytosol was eluted with the same equilibration buffer. Most of the protein was contained within the first 2.5 ml of eluate as determined by Bradford protein assay. Protein concentration was typically 7.5-8.5 mg/ml. The eluates were mixed well then aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.Set-up, incubation and mountingSet-upNote: All samples, except for water, must be kept on ice that is mixed with cold water (to allow for good heat exchange) prior to use in the assay.  Set the water bath to 37 °C. Prepare dilutions of all other reagents before defrosting membranes, cytosol and ATP/GTP mixture. Note: Defrost membrane aliquots and cytosol quickly in your hand and then put on wet ice. Aliquots of vesicles, Golgi, cytosol and ATP must be briefly spun down (~3 sec) in a microfuge straight after defrosting. Note: Do not vortex or flick membranes, cytosol or ATP/GTP, rather mix these by setting pipette volume to ~10% less than the aliquot volume and pipet up and down 7 times before any volume is removed. Buffers, in contrast, should be mixed by vortexing after defrosting.",
    "Dilute the vesicle stock to ensure about 70-150 vesicles per image. Notes:  This should be tested for new vesicle preps, but is generally in the range of a 10-30x dilution. Assay mixtures should be made up in 0.5 ml microfuge tubes. Mix assay components in the order: water, reaction buffer and other buffers, cytosol, Golgi, vesicles, and ATP/GTP mixture.IncubationA typical assay will contain: 3.8 µl Golgi (see Note 1), 4 µl diluted vesicle stock, cytosol equivalent to 57 mg total protein, cytosol buffer (see Recipes) such that the sum of this and the cytosol volume is 15.5 µl, 5 µl 10x concentrated reaction buffer (see Recipes), 2.75 µl assay sucrose (see Recipes), 5 µl 10x concentrated ATP/GTP mixture (see Recipes) in a 50 µl total volume. The assay mixture is gently pipetted up and down 10 times before placing 25 µl into a separate tube. Half of the assay mixture is left on wet ice while the other is transferred to the 37 °C water bath.Samples are incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in the dark, then transferred back onto wet ice. Assay mixtures are mounted immediately after incubation.MountingPrior to mounting, the silica bead suspension was briefly vortexed, and then 1 µl of this added to the assay mixture. The assay mixture was pipetted up and down 20 times with a pipet set to 21 µl, then quickly 3 µl was applied as two separate drops onto one half of a slide and immediately covered with a clean square coverslip. The edges were quickly sealed with clear nail varnish to prevent sample evaporation and fix in place. The 37 °C and ice incubated halves of the same assay were mounted in pairs onto the same slide. Slides were stored protected from light in a 4 °C fridge until imaging.",
    "Figure 1 shows how sample mounting is performed in the overall context of how the assay is executed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171115/20171115023726_0884.jpgFigure 1. Execution of the assay. GalT-YFP vesicles and GalT-CFP Golgi are mixed together in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing the desired reaction conditions. The mixture is equally divided into two tubes. One is incubated at 0 °C for 40 min as an internal control, and the other is incubated at 37 °C for the same period. After incubation, 5 micron silica beads are mixed with each sample, then 3 μl of the mixture is immediately delivered in two roughly equally-sized spots onto a microscope slide. The sample is covered with a 22 x 22 mm coverslip, sealed around the edges with clear nail varnish with the silica beads acting as spacers. The slide is kept in the dark at 4 °C until imaging by epifluorescence microscopy at room temperature.ImagingEquipment set-up and controlImages were collected by bright-field microscopy using an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera, attached to a ZEISS Axiovert 200M fully motorized inverted microscope. Illumination was provided by an X-Cite 120Q excitation light source. The adjustable iris of the X-Cite was set to level 3 of 4, where level 4 is fully open for maximum output. The objective lens was a ZEISS Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC. The microscope was controlled by ZEN 2009 software (ZEISS) and the camera was controlled by PM Capture Pro software (Photometrics) running on the same computer system as the ZEISS software. CFP and YFP filters from Chroma Technology Corporation were used. Although confocality is not used, it is essential to use a fully motorized stage, filter wheel and shutters, hence the use of this microscope.",
    "Extraneous room light on the sample during imaging was minimized by using low-light conditions and by also shielding the sample with matt black card as follows. On a circular disc of the card (~7 cm in diameter), a circular hole was cut in the center that was slightly smaller than the diameter of the outer casing of the retractable front lens on the 63x objective. The front lens was gently pushed through the hole so that the disc formed a wide ‘collar’ to block light from below, then a sheet of card with a central rectangular hole was placed over the objective to cover gaps. Subsequently the universal mounting frame (i.e., the part which clips into the motorized stage) was placed above the rectangular card to hold the slide. On the microscope stage, a box lid made of the same card of dimensions approximately 15 x 10 x 2 cm (L x W x H), was placed over the sample (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171115/20171115023914_0409.jpgFigure 2. Shielding the mounted sample during imaging. Although low-light room conditions are used during imaging, extraneous light on the sample is also minimized by shielding. Matt black card is utilized as follows: 1. a wide collar is fitted around the objective lens to block light from below; 2. a sheet with a rectangular hole is placed over the objective to cover gaps; and 3. a shallow box lid is placed on top to block light from above. The slide is placed in the universal mounting frame on top of the rectangular sheet in image 2.The open source software AutoHotkey was used to write scripts to automate control of the ZEN 2009 and PM Capture Pro software. The scripts (programmed to be launched by pressing the keyboard F-keys or buttons of a joypad i.e.",
    ", as ‘hotkeys’) moved the cursor to activate commands in both the microscope and camera software windows with appropriate time delays. The scripts were programmed so that the operations of changing filters, opening/closing the lamp shutter, and camera image acquisition occurred in sequence to obtain 1 image each for vesicles (YFP channel) and Golgi (CFP channel). This ensured all images were captured under the same conditions, and without unnecessary delay to avoid bleaching of the fluorophores.Sample handling and image acquisitionThe sample should be removed from the fridge a couple minutes before imaging to stop condensation build-up. Once on the microscope, the room must be switched to low-light conditions and the sample must be shielded from external light by covering it with matt black card from top and bottom as described above. Focusing is tricky due to the lack of contrast of the membranes under bright-field illumination. Initial focusing should aim for the 5 µm glass beads using the halogen lamp on low intensity. Then, for finer focus using the YFP fluorescence of the vesicles, the high gain preview mode of the EMCCD camera must be used (see Note 2). They are too faint to be seen via the eyepiece and the camera needs to ‘see’ the precise focal plane of these sub-micron particles. It is easy to overfocus, thereby squashing the sample, in which case it has to be re-mounted. Once the focal plane with the vesicles is found, care should be taken so that all images are collected from the particles sitting on the coverslip rather than the ones on the slide. A quick refocusing away from the coverslip will verify this by showing the slide-attached particles; this check should be performed regularly.",
    "Moving the distance of a few fields of view in the x-y plane usually keeps the focus close enough to require only little adjustments to regain focus.For each assay condition, 12-16 images per incubation temperature need to be collected. Particles bleach quickly, so care should be taken that the focusing time overall does not exceed 7 sec before image acquisition is started. Camera settings may need to be adjusted depending on the age of the excitation lamp. A set of ideal settings are in Note 2. A very short exposure time with binning and a high gain is used for finding an appropriate area and focusing. Conversely, a long exposure time without binning and low gain is used to acquire images of vesicles and Golgi with higher resolution and lower noise. Scripts need to be written (using for example the AutoHotkey program for PC) to automate the sequence of operations performed by the microscope and camera to acquire images for the YFP and CFP channels (described above). These scripts should be programmed to launch upon pressing single ‘hotkeys’ such as the F-keys, or even the buttons of a joypad can be assigned. This allows single click initiation of the three presets (see Note 2) that allow preview mode for focusing, followed by YFP and CFP image acquisition. Note: We found that programming further keys for saving the YFP (vesicles) and CFP (Golgi) channel images with a V_ or G_ prefix followed by a time-stamp in the file name made data acquisition and subsequent processing much more user-friendly. This also ensured that the correct vesicle and Golgi images from the same field of view were always paired up together afterwards."
