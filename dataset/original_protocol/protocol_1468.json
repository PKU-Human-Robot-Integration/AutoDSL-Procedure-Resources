Incubate at room temperature for 3 min.\nTransfer 10–20 larvae in approximately 1 mL of fish water containing tricaine to a depression slide. To reduce clutter, use the microprobe to group the larvae together at the nearest edge of the depression.\nImplant larvae with foreign material (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1011-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Procedure for implantation of foreign bodies\n(A) Larva grasped using VAMP and aligned with the CAIN.\n(B) Incision made through forebrain and guided into hindbrain ventricle.\n(C) Egg being grasped by the CAIN.\n(D) Egg aligned with the incision.\n(E) Egg passed through incision and into hindbrain ventricle.\n(F) Egg deposited in hindbrain ventricle.\n(G) Completed implantation.\nScale bar, 150 μm. See also Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nUsing the VAMP, grasp a single larva by its tail. (See Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].)\nCarefully push the forebrain of the larva into the CAIN to make an incision (see Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nRemove the larva from the CAIN by gently pulling with the VAMP.\nPosition the CAIN directly above the object to be implanted (e.g., schistosome egg, polymer bead, etc.). Lower the CAIN to the object, which will then be grasped by the CAIN via capillary action.\nAlign the object with the incision.\nPass the object through the forebrain incision and into the hindbrain ventricle.",
    "Slightly angle the VAMP relative to the CAIN to wipe the object from the tip of the CAIN, depositing it into the hindbrain ventricle.\nRepeat steps a-g until the desired number of larvae have been implanted.\nTransfer implanted larvae into standard 100 mm petri plates containing 35 mL of fish water containing 1× PTU. House the larvae at a density no greater than 60 larvae per plate.\nIncubate at 28°C for the desired amount of time before analysis, typically 1 h or up to 5 days.\nCritical: To avoid aspirating the larva during implantation, do not use excessive thumb pressure when grasping with the VAMP (see Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nOptional: This procedure may be repeated to implant more than one foreign body per larva, as well as co-implantation of two or more different materials to observe their interaction with each other and with the host.\nWhile the acellular hindbrain ventricle is ideal for assessing immune responses to foreign materials, this procedure has been used successfully to implant materials into other anatomical regions of the zebrafish, including various regions of the brain, and the yolk sac. The avascular regions of the yolk sac may be used to study angiogenesis in response to implanted materials, and the brain may be used to study the interaction of neurons with implanted materials, for example, in the study of brain machine interfaces.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Microimplantation, related to step 2\nImaging foreign body immune responses and granuloma formation\nTiming: 2–4 hours\nIn the following steps, the previously implanted larvae will be anesthetized, mounted onto glass slides, and then imaged by microscopy.\nAnesthetize larval zebrafish at the desired time point post-implantation by immersion in 0.016%w/v tricaine.",
    "Add 420 μL of 0.4%w/v tricaine to 10 mL of fish water in a 55 mm petri plate.\nUsing a wide-bore Pasteur pipette, transfer ≤100 larvae to the fish water containing tricaine.\nMount anesthetized larvae in 1.5% low melting point agarose (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nTransfer 3–6 anesthetized larvae in approximately 20 μL of fish water to an optical glass-bottom plate with 20 mm glass diameter wells.\nAdd 20 μL of 1.5% low melting point agarose.\nWorking quickly, use the microprobe to swirl the larvae to mix the agar and fish water together, then position the larvae laterally in a row, and then rotate the larvae to orient them with their hindbrain ventricle in contact with the bottom of the glass. If any larvae rotate out of position, use the probe to quickly reposition them until the agar has solidified. Return the low melting point agarose to 43°C heat block.\nRepeat a-c until each well contains up to 36 mounted larvae.\nAdd 20 μL of fish water containing tricaine per group of 3–6 mounted larvae to prevent dehydration. If the imaging session will exceed 1 h, fill the bottom of the well with fish water containing tricaine to submerge the agar-mounted larvae and prevent dehydration.\nImage implanted zebrafish by confocal microscopy\nMount the plate of implanted zebrafish onto the stage of a confocal microscope.\nBy eye, set the X and Y coordinates for each larval hindbrain ventricle, with the implanted object in the center of the field of view.\nUnder fluorescence, set the z position to 10 μm beyond the edge of each implanted object.\nSet z-stack to scan through the depth of the implanted object, with an additional 10 μm beyond.\nSet the imaging parameters for the resolution required for either timelapse or static confocal imaging.",
