    "Slide preparationAdd 50 µl 0.1% poly-L-lysine to each well of an 8-well glass slide and allow to sit for 5 min at room temperature (see Note 2).Briefly rinse the wells with ddH2O, remove the excess liquid using a vacuum, and allow the slide to air dry completely (see Notes 3 and 4).Bacterial culturesPrepare an overnight culture: inoculate one single colony from a streaked agar plate to 3 ml TSB in a glass test tube; add the appropriate antibiotics, if needed.Grow the overnight culture at 37°C with rigorous shaking at 220 rpm.The next morning, inoculate 30 µl overnight culture to 3 ml fresh TSB (1:100 dilution).Grow the cultures at 37°C with rigorous shaking at 220 rpm.Measure the optical density OD600 of the culture every hour in a spectrophotometer.Place the cultures on ice when OD600 reaches 0.8–1.0 (see Note 5).Continue the sample preparation in Part C below according to the different protocols (A, B, or C).Sample preparationProtocol A – Surface display: Transfer 2 ml bacterial culture into a 2 ml microcentrifugation tube.Spin at 18,000 x g for 3 min in a tabletop centrifuge to pellet the bacterial cells.Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml PBS and vortex well.Spin at 18,000 × g for 3 min and remove the supernatant (steps 4–5 are “wash with PBS” steps).Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml PBS, vortex thoroughly; mix 250 µl bacterial suspension with 250 µl fixation solution (see Recipes) in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, briefly vortex to mix, and incubate for 20 min at room temperature (fixation step).Wash twice with PBS, as described in steps 4–5 (see Note 6).Resuspend the pellet in 150 µl PBS, vortex thoroughly (see Note 7).Add 50 µl bacterial suspension to poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides and allow to sit for 5 min.",
    "Remove the excess liquid (non-adherent cells) using a vacuum.Add one drop of PBS to each well using a plastic disposable transfer pipette and remove using a vacuum (this is the “drop and remove on-slide wash” step).Repeat the drop and remove on-slide wash step.Continue with immunofluorescence in Part D.Protocol B – Cross-wall localization: Transfer 2 ml bacterial culture into a 2 ml microcentrifugation tube.Spin at 18,000 × g for 3 min in a tabletop centrifuge to pellet the bacterial cells.Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.Wash once with PBS.Resuspend the pellet in 900 µl PBS, vortex thoroughly; add 100 µl 5 mg/ml trypsin stock solution (see Recipes) and briefly vortex (trypsin final concentration: 0.5 mg/ml).Incubate the tubes in a Mini-tube rotator at 37°C for 1 h at a rotation speed of 16 (medium speed).Wash twice with PBS.Resuspend the pellet in 900 µl fresh TSB, vortex thoroughly; add 100 µl 10 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor stock solution (see Recipes) and briefly vortex to mix (final concentration of soybean trypsin inhibitor: 1 mg/ml).Incubate the tubes in a Mini-tube rotator at 37°C for exactly 20 min at a rotation speed of 16 (see Note 8).Add 250 µl fixation solution to a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube during the 20 min incubation.At the 20-min timepoint, quickly transfer 250 µl bacterial sample to the microcentrifuge tubes prepared in the previous step.Vortex to mix and allow the sample to sit at room temperature for 20 min.Wash twice with PBS.Resuspend the pellet in 150 µl PBS and vortex thoroughly (adjust the volume depending on the pellet size).Add 50 µl bacterial suspension to a glass slide coated with poly-L-lysine and allow to sit for 5 min.Remove the liquid (non-adherent cells) using a vacuum.Perform the drop and remove on-slide wash twice for each well as described above.",
    "Continue with immunofluorescence in Part D.Protocol C – Cytoplasmic/septal membrane localization: Place two 50 ml tubes containing approximately 25 ml methanol and 25 ml acetone, respectively, into a -20°C freezer.Normalize all the bacterial cultures to OD600 = 1.Transfer 2 ml normalized bacterial culture to a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube (this step is to have same cell numbers for the following enzymatic digestion step).Spin at 18,000 × g for 3 min in a tabletop centrifuge to pellet the bacterial cells.Remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.Wash once with PBS.Resuspend the pellet in 900 µl PBS and vortex thoroughly; add 100 µl 5 mg/ml trypsin stock solution and briefly vortex (see Note 9).Incubate in a Mini-tube rotator at 37°C for 1 h at a rotation speed of 16.Wash twice with PBS.Resuspend the pellet in 500 µl PBS, vortex thoroughly; add 500 µl fixation solution and vortex to mix.Incubate the sample for 15 min at room temperature and then on ice for 15 min to fix.Wash three times with PBS.Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml freshly made GTE buffer (see Recipes) and vortex thoroughly (see Note 10).Add 50 µl cell suspension to poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides (this is the control without lysostaphin digestion) (see Note 11).Prepare a timer, add 10 µl lysostaphin working solution (see Recipes) to the rest of the cell suspension; quickly vortex and immediately add 50 µl to the glass slides (see Note 12).Incubate for 2 min on the slide (see Note 13).Remove the liquid using a vacuum until completely dry.Immediately place the slide into prechilled methanol at -20°C for 5 min.Take out the slide using forceps and place into prechilled acetone at -20°C for 30 s (see Note 14).Take out the slide using forceps and allow to air-dry completely.",
    "Once the slide is dry, apply 50 µl PBS to the sample well to rehydrate.Perform the drop and remove on-slide wash twice for each well.Continue with immunofluorescence in Part D.ImmunofluorescenceRemove PBS, add BSA blocking solution (see Recipes), and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.Remove the blocking solution, add 50 µl primary antibody solution (rabbit serum SpAKKAA 1:4,000 dilution in BSA blocking solution), and incubate overnight at 4°C or at room temperature for 1 h (see Note 15).Remove the unbound primary antibody solution and wash 8 times with PBS with the last wash step for 5 min.Remove the washing solution, add 50 µl secondary antibody diluted in BSA blocking solution (e.g., Alexa Fluor 647-IgG or Alexa Fluor 488-IgG, 1:500 dilution), and incubate in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature (see Note 16).Perform the on-slide wash 10 times with PBS.Take a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, add 1 ml PBS, 5 µl Hoechest stock solution (1:200 dilution), 2 µl Van-FL stock solution (1:500 dilution), or 5 µl Nile Red stock solution (1:200 dilution) (see Recipes) and mix well; add 50 µl staining solution to each well.Incubate in the dark for 10 min at room temperature.Perform the on-slide wash three times with PBS.After the last wash, remove all the excess liquid from the well.Add a 5-μl drop of Slow Fade Diamond Antifade Mountant at 3 different places between the sample wells (see Note 17).Brush a thin layer of nail polish around the edges of the slide and seal with a cover slip; gently press the cover slip and use a Kim wipes to remove the excess antifade solution around the edges (see Note 18).Image the samples using a microscope with the appropriate fluorescent channels (Part E).",
    "The prepared slides can be stored at 4°C for a few days and at -20°C for a longer period; however, immediate imaging is recommended.ImagingThe samples prepared above are suitable to be imaged by different imaging systems, including epi-fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy, or deconvolution microscopy. However, to reveal bacterial cellular features and define protein localization in tiny bacterial cells, a microscope with high resolution is recommended. A 60× or 100× objective lens with a higher numerical aperture is needed. We used a Leica DM 2000 coupled with a sensitive CCD camera, a Leica SP5 2-photon Laser Scanning Confocal microscope, and a Leica SP8 3X STED Laser Confocal Microscope. All showed good imaging results.Representative images of protocols A, B, and C are displayed in Figure 2. The images were captured using a Leica SP5 2-photon Laser Scanning Confocal microscope.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4038/bioprotoc-11-10-4038-g002.jpgFigure 2.
