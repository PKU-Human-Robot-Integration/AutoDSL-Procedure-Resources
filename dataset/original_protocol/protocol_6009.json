    "Preparation and setupNote: As a first step, allow the JC-1 powder and DMSO solutions to come to 25 °C before use. Prepare a fresh 200 μM JC-1 dye stock solution immediately prior to use by reconstituting the lyophilized JC-1 dye with DMSO to obtain a 100x stock solution. Mix the preparation until the solution is clear of aggregates and the dye powder is completely dissolved.Staining protocol for cells in suspensionThe following protocol describes the preparation steps for the use of the JC-1 dye on cultured cells in Suspension followed by analysis of the cells preparation by flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence plate reader.Based on the experiment design, the cells are seeded on gelatin-coated cell culture flasks or glass chamber slides, cultured in the warm culture medium and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 exposure. The culture medium is changed every other day until the cells reach confluency.Split the adhered cells from the flasks or glass chamber slides.Briefly, remove the medium from culture vessel by aspiration and then dispense enough trypsin or trypsin/EDTA solution into culture vessel(s) to cover the monolayer of cells completely and then place in 37 °C incubator for ~6 min. Remove the trypsin or trypsin/EDTA solution and add it to sterile centrifuge tube (15 ml) containing the equal amount of warm cell culture medium (~37 °C) and centrifuge for 7 min at 25 °C at 125 x g. Then remove the medium from the tube by aspiration.In order to suspend cells in the tube, for each sample, add 1 ml warm cell culture medium (~37 °C), PBS, or another buffer not to exceed 1 x 106 cells/ml.",
    "Wash cells by adding 2 ml of warm PBS (~37 °C) or another buffer to each tube containing cells and centrifuge for 5 min at 25 °C at 400 x g.Remove the supernatant.Suspend the cell pellet again in 1 ml of fresh cell culture medium or PBS (~37 °C).Add 10 μl of 200 μM JC-1 dye (2 μM in final concentration) and incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 15-30 min. Then follow the procedure of Steps B8 and B9 to prepare the positive control.Induce cell apoptosis in one of the sample preparations which will be used as a positive control for the remaining samples. To provide the positive control, add 1 μl of 50 mM of CCCP (50 μM in final concentration) just to one sterile centrifuge tube (1.5 ml) containing 1 ml warm cell culture medium (~37 °C), PBS, or another buffer not to exceed 1 x 106 cells/ml and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Wash all samples by adding 2 ml of warm PBS (~37 °C or another buffer to each tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 25 °C at 400 x g. Remove the supernatant. Re-suspend the cell pellet again in 300 μl fresh cell culture medium or PBS (~37 °C).Begin observation and measuring immediately after completing the last step using one of the following methods including flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence plate reader analysis as described below. Typically, for each sample, the number of replicates should be n = 3 and the number of observation and measurement should be more than 5 for each sample. Staining protocol of monolayer cellsThe following protocol describes the process of JC-1 staining in cultured cell monolayers and following analysis using either fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence plate reader.",
    "Cells can be cultured on pre-coated glass coverslips (in a Petri dish), 96 wells plate supports or chamber slides. Make sure not to exceed a max cell density of ~1 x 106 cells/cm2.Precoating (agent and density) depends upon the cells used. Refer to your specific cell culture protocol.Remove the cell culture medium and then replace it with a warm medium (~37 °C), PBS, or another buffer.Wash cells once by adding warm PBS (~37 °C) or another buffer and add again fresh cell culture medium or PBS (~37 °C).Add 2 μM (final concentration) of JC-1 dye and incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 15-30 min.For the positive control, add 50 μM final concentration of CCCP and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 5 min.Remove the culture medium of all samples and wash the cells once by adding warm PBS or another buffer (~37 °C). Add PBS to samples (about 100 μl into each of the 96 wells plate or corresponding amount in a petri dish or chamber slides depending on the culture platform and detection methods that was selected). Cover with a sheet of foil to keep the culture platform and its content out of light. Analyze the fluorescence of the test cultures (including controls) immediately. For the quantification methods, please refer to Note A."
