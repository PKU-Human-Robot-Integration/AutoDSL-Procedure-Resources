    "This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of The Catholic University of Korea (KC16EAME0162) and performed according to NIH guidelines. All tissues were obtained with written informed consent.\n1. Centrifugal Gravity Loading and Pellet Culture\nCell culture and harvest\n\t\nCulture ASCs (P2-P3; see List of Materials) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium-low glucose (DMEM-LG) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\nWhen the cells reach 80% confluence, discard the medium and wash the cells with 5 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nAdd 1 mL of PBS containing 1 mM EDTA and incubate for 2 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\nTap the culture plate gently, add 4 mL of fresh medium, transfer the cells to a 15-mL conical tube, and centrifuge the cells at 250 × g for 2 min at room temperature (RT).\nCentrifugal gravity loading\n\t\nAfter centrifugation (step 1.1.4), remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of DMEM-LG with 10% FBS. Count the cells using a hemocytometer.\nFor CG loading, transfer 2.5 × 105 cells to a new 15-mL conical tube and centrifuge at 2,400 × g for 15 min.\nPellet culture\n\t\nImmediately after centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant and add 500 µL of defined chondrogenic differentiation medium (CDM, high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS, 1% ITS+Premix, 100 nM dexamethasone, 1x MEM non-essential amino acid solution, 50 µg/mL L-proline, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Add 50 µg/mL of freshly prepared L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate at every medium change. As a positive control, induce chondrogenic differentiation in uncentrifuged cells by adding CDM containing 10 ng/mL TGF-β1.",
    "Place the loosely capped tubes containing the pellets in a standing position and incubate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\nChange the medium every other day for 3 weeks.\nMicromass culture\n\t\nImmediately after centrifugation (step 1.2.2; 2,400 × g for 15 min), aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 µL of CDM.\nTo form a micromass, place the resuspended cells in the center of a well of a 24-well plate.\nAfter 2 h, carefully add 1 mL of CDM to the well, pipetting against the wall of the plate to avoid disrupting the micromass. As a positive control, perform a micromass culture with uncentrifuged cells by adding CDM containing 10 ng/mL TGF-β1.\nIncubate the micromass at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.\nChange the medium every other day for 3 weeks.\n2. Reverse Transcriptase–Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) to Detect Transcriptional Upregulation of Chondrogenic Differentiation Markers\nOn day 14, use a pipette to transfer the spheroid pellets to a new 1.5-mL tube and wash them in 1x PBS.\nExtract the total RNA from the pellets using the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method9.\nSynthesize cDNA from 2 µg of total RNA using reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol (incubate at 42 °C for 1 h and then inactivate the enzyme at 70 °C for 5 min).\nPerform PCR with primers specific for chondrogenic differentiation markers10.\n3. Staining to Detect the Overexpression of Chondrogenic Differentiation Marker Proteins\nParaffin-embedding cell pellets\n\t\nOn day 21, use a pipette to harvest the spheroid pellets and wash them with 1x PBS.\nFix the spheroid pellets by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h.\n\t\tCaution: Paraformaldehyde is highly toxic. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, or mucous membranes. Minimize exposure and avoid inhalation during preparation. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment.",
    "Discard the fixative and rinse the cell pellets with deionized water (DW).\nPlace one layer of gauze onto the cassette and transfer the fixed pellets using a pipette. Cover the pellet by folding the gauze and close the cassette lid.\nDehydrate the pellets.\n\t\t\nImmerse the pellets in 70% ethanol (EtOH) for 5 min at RT.\nImmerse the pellets in 80% EtOH for 5 min at RT.\nImmerse the pellets in 95% EtOH for 5 min at RT.\nImmerse the pellets in 100% EtOH for 5 min at RT. Repeat twice.\nImmerse the pellets in 100% xylene for 15 min at RT. Repeat twice.\nEmbed the fixed cell pellets in paraffin at 56 °C in a mold; the pellets can be embedded into paraffin using specialized automated tissue processing systems.\nCut 5 µm-thick sections from the paraffin-embedded cell pellet using a rotary microtome.\nFloat the sections in 50% EtOH and then transfer them to a 50 °C water bath using a slide.\nPlace the floating sections onto slides.\nSafranin O and Alcian blue staining\n\t\nRehydrate the paraffin sections.\n\t\t\nImmerse the slides in xylene for 15 min. Repeat twice.\nImmerse the slides in 100% EtOH for 5 min. Repeat twice.\nImmerse the slides in 90% EtOH for 5 min.\nImmerse the slides in 80% EtOH for 5 min.\nImmerse the slides in 70% EtOH for 5 min, and then wash them in 1x PBS.\nStain the rehydrated sections with 1% Safranin O solution and 3% Alcian blue for 30 min.\nDiscard the staining solution and rinse the sections with DW.\nStain the sections with Hematoxylin/Eosin solution (counterstain) for 1 min.\nDiscard the staining solution and rinse the sections with DW.",
    "Place a drop of mounting medium on a coverslip after removing any residual water. Carefully place the slide (cell-side down) on the coverslip containing the mounting medium.\nAllow the slides to dry for 2-3 h at RT.\nCapture images using a bright-field microscope (automated upright microscope, 50X and 200X).\nImmunofluorescence assay\n\t\nRehydrate the sections as described in section 3.2.1.\nImmerse the slides in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0), and then maintain them at a sub-boiling temperature for 10 min using a microwave.\nCool the slides for 20 min at RT and then wash them with tap water.\nIncubate the slides in 3% H2O2 (in 1x PBS) for 15 min, and then wash them with tap water for 15 min11.\nBlock the slides with blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 h.\nAspirate the blocking solution, and then apply a primary antibody diluted with 5% normal goat serum onto the slides.\nIncubate the slides overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the slides three times in 1x PBS for 5 min each.\nIncubate the slides in fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody diluted with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at RT in the dark.\nWash the slides three times in 1x PBS for 5 min each in the dark.\nIncubate the slides with DAPI (1 µg/mL) for 10 min, and then wash them two times in 1x PBS for 5 min each.\nPlace a drop of mounting medium on a coverslip after removing any residual water.
