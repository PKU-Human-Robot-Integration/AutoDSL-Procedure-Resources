    "All mice were maintained at an American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)–accredited animal facility at the Johns Hopkins University and housed in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all experimental protocols.\n1. Experimental Preparation\nCoat 12-well plate with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) in Phosphate Buffered Solution (PBS) for 60 min.\nRemove coating solution and add 200 µl of Serum-free Media (SFM). Twirl plate to make sure that a film of media covers the entire surface area.\n2. Surgical Procedures\nEuthanize pregnant mice using the institution's animal care committee-approved protocol followed by cervical dislocation to ensure complete euthanasia.\nSpray and clean the belly region of the mouse with 70% ethanol. Maintain strict sterile techniques to avoid contamination.\nUse forceps and scissors to make a 0.5 cm2 incision at the navel region.\nUse fingers to pinch/grab the skin above and below the incision and gently pull the skin in opposite directions (head and tail).\nUse forceps and scissors to make an initial incision in the membrane at the navel region. Gently cut the membrane in V-shape from the navel to the ovaries on each side (2 x 1.5 cm2), thereby revealing the uterus.\nUse forceps to pinch the oviduct connecting the uterus to the ovary and scissors to pinch the oviduct on the ovary side, thus freeing the uterus from the ovary.\nGently pull up the uterus by the oviduct with the forceps and cut the uterus free from the bladder region with scissors.\nPull the uterus further up by the oviduct with the forceps, and cut the oviduct with scissors on the other side, thereby releasing the uterus from the mouse.",
    "Transfer the uterus to a 50 ml tube and add 20 ml of cold sterile PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. PBS must contain Ca2+ and Mg2+ during embryo dissection.\nGently shake the tube for 10 sec to wash the uterus for blood.\nTransfer the uterus from the tube with forceps and place it in a 10 ml dish and add 5 ml of cold PBS on top of the uterus.\nPlace the dish with the uterus under a stereomicroscope.\n\tNote: Steps 2.13-2.19 requires a stereomicroscope.\nUse two pairs of forceps to gently open the uterus and dissect out amniotic sacs with embryos from the uterus one by one.\n\t\nUse two pairs of forceps to carefully open the amniotic sac that surrounds the embryo, pinch the sac with one forceps and gently remove it from the embryo, use the other forceps to cut and release the amniotic sac from the embryo. If a specific genotype needed, keep amniotic sac for genotyping.\nPlace the embryo on the side and use forceps to cut the 1st and 2nd arch posteriorly to the heart between the arch and the pharyngeal pouch (Figure 1A’’).\nGently flip the embryo to the other side and use forceps to cut the 1st and 2nd arch posteriorly to the heart between the arch and the pharyngeal pouch.\nUse forceps to cut the cardiac outflow tract that is still connecting the 1st and 2nd pharyngeal arches to the embryo. Remove the arches, which are still attached together in the shape of a butterfly (Figure 1B), from the embryo.\nUse forceps to pinch and release the 1st pharyngeal arches from the remaining cardiac outflow tract and foregut endoderm (Figure 1B’’ indicated with dashed line and *).",
    "Use forceps to pinch and release the 2nd pharyngeal arches from the remaining cardiac outflow tract and foregut endoderm (Figure 1B’’ indicated with dashed line and **).\nTransfer each pair of arches separately using forceps and place both arches in the middle of a designated well. Plate 1st and 2nd pharyngeal arches in separate wells. Ensure that the arches are in contact with the film of media added in step 1.2. It is crucial that arches are NOT covered by medium, as they need to make contact with the surface of the well for attachment during this period.\n3. Incubation and Imaging\nIncubate arches plated in the 12-well plate in 37 °C/5% CO2 for 2 hr for arches to attach to the well surface area.\nGently add 200 µl of 37 °C SFM down the side of the well. Make sure that arches remain attached and incubate O/N.\nNext day, visually check that pharyngeal arches are attached and gently add 200 µl of 37 °C SFM down the side of the well. If arches remain unattached and floating, gently remove media with a pipette without removing arches until only a film of media is left. Use pipette tip to place arches in the middle of the well and repeat step 3.1.\nMonitor daily; add ~100-200 µl of media every 2nd day to replace any evaporated media.\n\tNote: 24-48 hr after migrating cells appear around the arch and will proliferate and migrate from arch over the next 5-8 days. After 36-72 hr formation of beating cardiomyocytes can be observed from the 2nd pharyngeal arch (Figure 2B). Myotube formation can be observed from the 1st pharyngeal arch 3-7 days after attachment (Figure 2A).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
