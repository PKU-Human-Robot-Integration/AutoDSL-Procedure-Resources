    "CHX can be used to determine changes in protein stability/half-live between different conditions, such as knockout vs. wild-type, overexpressed or in a knock-down situation. This protocol uses the example of Tyk2 stability in AHI1 knock-down cells.Cell culture and transfection Cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (complete medium). Cells were cultured with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA enzyme digesting technique and passaged in vitro.Take A549 cells from -80 °C or liquid nitrogen and quickly place them in a 37 °C constant temperature water bath for approximately 2–3 min until the cells are completely thawed.Place the cells into a centrifuge at 157× g for 3 min.Remove the serum-free cell freezing medium, add 1 mL of complete medium to resuscitate cells, and transfer cells to a 100 mm culture dish.Culture A549 cells in a 100 mm culture dish until 90% confluent.Seed the cells at the ratio of 1:24 (5 × 105 cells) into six wells of a 12-well plate.After 18–24 h, observe the cell density (approximately 80%–90%), and then perform the transfection of plasmids (such as shCtrl or shAHI1).Remove the medium and add 1 mL of fresh complete medium before transfection.Label 1.5 mL tubes as required and add 50 μL of DMEM basic medium to the tubes.Prepare transfection solution A: add 1 μg of plasmid into DMEM medium and gently mix in the 1.5 mL tubes.Prepare transfection solution B: add the LongTrans (DMEM:plasmid:longtrans = 50 μL:1 μg:2 μL) into DMEM medium and gently mix in the 1.5 mL tubes.Gently mix transfection solutions A and B and leave at room temperature (RT) for 10–15 min.Gently add the mixture to the corresponding medium and shake gently.",
    "Place the plates in the incubator for approximately 36–48 h (for overexpressed plasmid) or 48–72 h (for knockdown plasmid).Treat cells with CHX (50 μg/mL) for the appropriate timepoints (Section B).CHX treatment CAUTION: CHX is a highly toxic chemical and very toxic if swallowed; please avoid direct contact and release to the environment. In case of accident or if you feel unwell, seek medical advice immediately.Remove the cell medium and replace with 1 mL of complete medium.Distribute 500 μg of CHX into 0.6 mL tubes.Add 10 μL of DMSO to the tube and mix well (the final concentration of CHX should be 50 mg/mL). CHX is better dissolved fresh to ensure maximal activity.Slowly add 1 μL of CHX into the 1 mL cell culture medium and shake the plate gently to mix well. Similarly, add 1 μL of DMSO into the corresponding well as a control.Harvest cells and extract cellular proteins (Section C).Extracting cellular proteins Prepare cell lysis buffer: add PMSF (1:100) to 1× NP-40 lysis buffer before use.Place the cells on ice and aspirate the medium.Gently add 1× PBS to wash and discard the PBS thoroughly. Repeat twice.Add lysis buffer to the cells (100 μL per well).Place the cells on ice for 30 min.Scrap down the fully lysed cells with a cell scraper.Transfer cell lysates to a 1.5 mL tube.Place the 1.5 mL tubes into a 4 °C centrifuge at 12,000× g for 15 min.Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube to get the cleared lysate (save at -80 °C); discard the cell debris sediment.Use Bradford to determine protein concentration.Denature 30–50 μg of proteins and add SDS-sample buffer to the samples.Boil the samples in a metal bath at 96 °C for 10 min.Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 1 min.",
    "Use the samples for western blot or save them at -20 °C for future use.Protein degradation analysis by western blot Prepare the 8% SDS-PAGE gels (the gel concentration can be adjusted to 8%–12% depending on the molecular weight of the detected protein) with 8% separation gel and 5% stacking gel.Dilute the 10× running buffer to 1× with double-distilled water (ddH2O).Add 1× running buffer to the vertical electrophoresis chamber.Gently pull out the comb of SDS-PAGE gel under running water and assemble it into vertical electrophoresis chamber.Fill the chamber with running buffer.Load the denatured protein samples into the lane of stacking gel and place 2 μL of PageRuler prestained protein ladder on both sides to indicate the molecular weight of the proteins.Run for approximately 30 min using constant 80 V when the samples are in the stacking gel, and for approximately 90 min in the resolving gel at 110 V for a better separation of proteins.Soak the PVDF membrane in absolute methanol for approximately 1 min to activate.Prepare 1× transfer buffer (10× transfer buffer:absolute methanol:double-distilled water = 1:1:8).Put the gel onto the activated PVDF membrane in 1× transfer buffer in the sequence of sponge, filter paper, gel, filter paper, and sponge.Transfer the proteins to the gel using constant 360 mA for 90–120 min and immerse the electrophoresis tank in ice water.Block the PVDF membrane with 5% non-fat milk with gentle shaking for 30 min at RT.Dilute primary antibodies in 1% BSA at the indicated dilution.Incubate the membrane with diluted primary antibodies with gentle shaking at RT for 2 h or 4 °C overnight.Wash the membrane in 1× PBST buffer at RT for 10 min. Repeat three times.Dilute the anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies in 5% non-fat milk at 1:10,000.",
    "Incubate the membrane with the secondary antibodies with gentle shaking at RT for 1 h.Wash the membrane in 1× PBST buffer at RT for 10 min. Repeat three times.Visualize immunoreactive bands with a SuperSignal West Dura Extended kit using X-ray film in the dark room.Edit gel images to the right size using Microsoft PowerPoint.Use ImageJ to count pixels of the bands and calculate protein half-life.Use GraphPad Prism to make the line chart."
