    "The following study has been approved by the institutional review board of the University Medical Center Rostock (II HV 43/2004, A 45/2007, A 2018-0054, A 2019-0187 and A 2019-0222). Furthermore, all veterinary relevant procedures have been approved by the Landesamt für Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Fischerei Mecklenburg-Vorpommern under the registration numbers LALLF M-V/TSD/ 7221.3-2-020/17 and 7221.3-1-007/19.\n1. Experimental Prerequisites\nMeet several important framework conditions to establish and maintain a biobank.\n\t\nUse a clinic with a surgical department and sufficient number of oncological resections together with a well-equipped lab and sufficient academic staff. A good infrastructure and a firm liaison with a cooperating pathology department are further prerequisites.\nFor in vivo research, use an animal facility with housing conditions appropriate to immunodeficient mice.\nObtain authorization on any research on patient-derived material from a health care ethics committee. Obtain approval on any in vivo research from the competent authority according to local statutory regulations.\n2. Sample collection\nThe day before surgery\n\t\nEvaluate all patients with resectable colorectal or pancreatic cancer and/or corresponding metastases for biobanking eligibility. Avoid including cases with neoadjuvant pretreatment, very small tumors, tumors of uncertain dignity or lesions which have been partly resected endoscopically before.\nObtain written approval of participation from the patient during the informed consent discussion about the surgical procedure. Inform timely all involved surgeons, the laboratory team as well as the pathologist.\nSample acquisition\n\t\nInform all attendants in the operation room (OR) about the tissue collection for the biobank immediately before the start of the surgical procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: It is crucial that the tissue must not be fixed in formalin. If the tissue is submerged in formalin, it becomes unsuitable for integrated biobanking.",
    "Draw 40 mL of heparinized blood (2 x 20 mL syringe) as well as a standard 7.5 mL serum tube immediately after anesthetic induction and transfer quickly to the lab for PBL isolation and serum processing (see step 3-4).\nObtain the resected specimen directly from the operating table, place it into an appropriate container and take it to the pathological department. Write down the time point of detachment from the circulation, resection and arrival at pathology.\n\t\tNOTE: The suitability of the specimen for bio banking should be assessed by the cooperating pathologist who dissects a slice of tumor and non-malignant tissue. Do not excise any parts of the specimen by yourself which may compromise the subsequent pathological report.\nPlace both tissue pieces in a separate 15 to 50 mL polypropylene tube with 10 to 30 mL tissue storage solution (or DPBS) on ice. Write down the time of receipt and transfer the specimens immediately to the lab.\n\t\tNOTE: The following protocol steps 3-6 must be conducted in a laminar flow cabinet under strict sterile conditions. Use all liquids at room temperature.\n3. Serum processing\nCentrifuge the 7.5 mL serum tube at 1128 x g and 4 °C for 15 min in a pre-cooled centrifuge.\nAliquot 1 mL serum per tube in pre-labeled cryotubes and freeze in liquid nitrogen.\n4. Isolation of PBL by density gradient centrifugation\nNOTE: Work parallel with each of the two 20 mL syringes.\nFill 20 mL of heparinized blood into a 50 mL polypropylene tube and add 15 mL of DPBS.\nTake 15 mL of Pancoll with a serological pipette, insert the pipette carefully all the way to the bottom of the polypropylene tube and release the Pancoll very slowly to form a layer beneath the blood/DBPS column.",
    "Centrifuge at 375 x g for 15 min without brake.\nAspirate and transfer the opaque interphase layer between the mid and top column of both samples into a fresh 50 mL Polypropylene tube and fill up with DPBS to 50 mL.\nCentrifuge at 270 x g for 15 min with brake.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 4.5 mL of freezer medium.\nAliquot 1.5 mL of the suspension per cryotube, close the tubes tightly and place them in a freezing container suitable for slow freezing and store at -80 °C.\n5. Tissue processing\nNOTE: Start with the generation of snap frozen samples of tumor and healthy tissue to maintain the integrity of nucleic acids.\nTumor tissue specimen\n\t\nTransfer the tumor specimen with several mL of tissue storage solution from the polypropylene tube to a Petri dish. Rinse with DPBS if necessary. Avoid touching the specimen and use two sterile scalpels to handle the tissue. Avoid desiccation at any time.\nWeigh the tumor specimen on a convenient scale in a separate dish and note the tissue weight.\nEvaluate size, shape and tissue quality of the tumor tissue before cutting. Aim to obtain at least one piece about the size of a pinhead for snap freezing and four cubes of approx. 30 mm3 (edge length 3 x 3x 3 mm) each for vital cryopreservation. Generate as many 30 mm3 -cubes in quadruples as possible and generate one piece for snap freezing per 5 quadruples. Also take into account that necrotic portions must be cut off so that the cubes consist of vital tissue only.\nGenerate slices of 3 mm thickness. Cut off necrotic portions, distinguishable as gel-like or liquid mass, and cut the slices into cubes of the two desired sizes.",
    "NOTE: Do not discard any tissue at this point.\nSnap freezing\n\t\t\nLabel cryotubes accordingly (see step 7.7).\nPlace one small tissue piece per pre-labeled cryotube. Submerge the samples immediately into liquid nitrogen for several minutes and store at -80 °C subsequently.\nCryopreservation of vital tissue\n\t\t\nLabel cryotubes accordingly (see step 7.7) and fill each with 1.5 mL of freezer medium. Place the freezing container beside the bench.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Follow the next steps as quickly as possible. Since the DMSO in the freezer medium has cytotoxic properties, the time of the tissue being submerged in freezer medium without proper cooling should not exceed 2 minutes.\nArrange the 30 mm3 cubes in quadruples. Shove necrotic tissue and other remains to the edge of the dish, but do not discard them.\nScoop the cubes with the scalpel blade and transfer 4 cubes per cryotube. Make sure that the tumor pieces are entirely submerged in freezer medium. Close the tubes tightly and place them in a freezing container suitable for slow freezing and store in a -80 °C freezer.\nTransfer cryotubes into a suited storage system for long term storage at -140 °C or lower. Documentation in the laboratory inventory management system is mandatory.\nHealthy tissue specimen: Repeat steps 5.1.1. to 5.1.6.4 for the healthy tissue specimen.\n6. Primary cell culture\nDisintegrate the remains of the tumor tissue, including the necrotic scrap, in the Petri dish with the scalpels to pieces as small as possible.\nPlace a sterile cell strainer (100 µm pore size) on top of a 50 mL polypropylene tube.\nUse a serological pipette to add 5-10 mL of DPBS to the Petri dish, float the tissue remains and pipette up and down to generate a suspension.\nTransfer the suspension with the pipette to the cell strainer.",
    "Repeat Steps 6.3-6.4 until all tissue remains are resolved from the Petri dish.\nUse the plunger of a 20 mL one-way syringe to squeeze the cell and tissue suspension through the cell strainer.\nRinse with 5-10 mL of fresh DPBS, discard the cell strainer and close the tube properly.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 180 x g for 5-10 minutes.\nPrepare a collagen-I precoated 6 well plate with 1.5 mL of medium per well.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of DPBS or medium and add 500 µL of the suspension to each well. Place the plate into the incubator (100% humidity, 5% CO2, 37 °C)\nMonitor the plate daily for cell growth and contamination.\n\tNOTE: Further cell culturing up to the point of establishment of a permanent cell line is not described here.\n7. PDX Generation\nConduct in vivo experiments only by appropriately qualified persons meeting the requirements of the competent authority of your jurisdiction.\nHouse immunodeficient mice under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions satisfying the demands of the used mouse strain. The hygienic measures include individually ventilated cages, autoclaved food, water and nesting material as well as a safety air lock and the wearing of personal, protective equipment.\nAutoclave all instruments beforehand and use only one set of instruments for each tumor case to avoid cross-contamination. Handle the tumor tissue as aseptic as possible. All plastic items named below should be sterile, single-use and discarded after each surgery.\n\tNOTE: Determined by the method of freezing four tumor tissue pieces per cryotube, the PDX generation requires always two mice per sample, ideally resulting in four PDX tumors.",
    "Choose the desired primary tumor for engraftment via the laboratory inventory management system and transfer the sample (vitally preserved tumor tissue) from the main storage tank to a portable liquid nitrogen container (Intermediate storage at -80 °C on dry ice is also convenient).\nPut on personal protective equipment before entering the SPF-section (scrubs, clogs, apron, hair cover, surgical mask and overshoes), disinfect your hands and all equipment.\nMatrigel soaking\n\t\nRemove the cryotube form the liquid nitrogen container and await thawing of the specimen.\nLabel a 50 mL polypropylene tube and fill with 35 mL of DPBS.\nTilt the cryotube up and down and transfer the content immediately to the polypropylene tube as soon as the tissue-medium-slush can be shifted. Gently rinse the tumor tissue pieces, discard the main volume from the tube in a separate vessel, close the lid and put the tube up-side-down, so that the four tissue pieces gather in the lid.\nPut a Petri dish on the cooling accumulator and place 100 µL of Matrigel as a single droplet into the middle. Use anatomical forceps to transfer the tumor pieces into the Matrigel. Make sure that each piece is covered completely with Matrigel. Incubate for 10 minutes at 4 °C.\nMouse anesthesia (2 mice per sample, work in parallel)\n\t\nPrepare a 3:1- stock of a ketamine (100 mg/mL) and xylazine (20 mg/mL) anesthetic solution. The recommended dose is 90/6 mg/kg body weight.\nWeigh the mouse and draw up the necessary anesthetic solution into a single use insulin syringe.",
    "Place the mouse on the grid of the cage, pull its tail gently with one hand to induce a forward movement and simultaneously crab the neck with a pinch grip of the other hand. Lift the mouse of the grid and turn the holding hand, so that animal's back rests on your palm. Immobilize one of the hind legs with your pinky and inject the narcotics intraperitoneally. Put the mouse back to its cage and await narcotic induction.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on the heating plate and cover the eyes with ointment to avoid corneal harm. Asses the depth of anesthesia by gently pinching the back foot of the mouse with surgical forceps.\n\t\tNOTE: Absence of movement indicates deep narcosis. Any kind of movement either requires more time for reaching the desired narcotic depth or an additional dose of anesthetics.\nSurgical procedure\n\t\nForm a skin fold by pinching the neck of the mouse and inject the microchip subcutaneously with the applicator (See step 9 for programming details)\nShave the flanks of the mouse if necessary (NMRInu/nu mice do not require shaving), apply povidone-iodine with a cotton swab and use surgical drape to create a sterile field.\nLift the skin of the flank with surgical forceps, make a small incision of circa 4 mm and form a small subcutaneous pocket by blunt preparation with scissors.\nPut one tumor piece into each pocket and place it at the rear end.\nClip the end of a 100 µL pipette tip and aspirate the remaining Matrigel from the Petri dish and apply it equally into each skin pocket.\nClose the wounds with simple interrupted sutures and apply spray dressing.\nScan the microchip and check validity of mouse- and tumor-ID.",
    "Prepare a new cage with fresh bedding and nesting material, as well as a gnawing stick. Fold a \"cushion\" out of paper towels and lay down the mouse with elevated head under an infrared heat lamp.\nMix 0.25 mL of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (400 mg/80 mg) with 100 mL of drinking water and administer via the drinking bottle. Consider that one mouse consumes approximately 150 mL per kg body weight daily.\n\tNOTE: Since the subcutaneous PDX-model is not associated with postoperative pain, neither during the wound healing process, nor during tumor outgrowth, postoperative analgesia is not required. Please note that the animal welfare guidelines of your institution/authority may differ.\nMonitoring of experimental animals\n\t\nMonitor the mice daily for signs of distress. This can be delegated to qualified animal caretakers.\nKeep up the postoperative antibiotic treatment with the aforementioned dosage for 4 weeks. Replace the antibiotic mixture twice per week.\nMeasure the tumor size at least once per week, ideally daily, with a caliper (tumor volume = 0.52 x length x width x height [mm3]) and record in the database.\n8. PDX harvesting and processing\nHarvest and process the PDX tumor, when:\n\tThe tumor size reaches the target volume of 1.500 mm3.\n\tThe tumor bearing animal shows signs of distress and/or disease and treatment is futile.\n\tThe tumor becomes ulcerated or penetrates the skin of the mouse.\nRead out the microchip to identify the correct PDX.\nEuthanize the mouse by a legal method (depending on national guidelines) as for example CO2-asphyxation or ketamine/xylazine injection followed by cervical dislocation.\nLift the skin with surgical forceps at the flanks and incise with Metzenbaum scissors a few millimeters distant from the tumor.",
    "Detach the skin above the tumor by blunt preparation, then carefully grasp the tumor with anatomical forceps and detach the tumor from the superficial fascia of the body.\nRinse the tumor with DPBS, put it into a Petri dish and remove adjacent connective tissue.\nAt this point, perform one of the following:\n\t\nCut 30 mm3 cubes and create new PDX (Proceed with protocol at point 7.7.4).\nCut the tumor into slices, which are then transferred to histology cassettes and preserved in 4% formaldehyde for later paraffin embedding.\nPreserve the tumor in a tube with tissue storage solution to add it to the biobank (Proceed with protocol at step 3.) and/or create PDX-derived cell lines (Proceed with protocol at step 4.)\n9. Biobank and data management\nAssign an internal ID to each tumor case according to Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nLaboratory location/name,cancer entity,consecutive case number,specification,consecutive number\n,C=colorectal,,_Met=Metastasis,\n,P=pancreatic,,_Tu=Tumor,\n\"Example: HROC389_Met2 = Rostock, colorectal cancer, case 389, second metastasis\",\"Example: HROC389_Met2 = Rostock, colorectal cancer, case 389, second metastasis\",\"Example: HROC389_Met2 = Rostock, colorectal cancer, case 389, second metastasis\",\"Example: HROC389_Met2 = Rostock, colorectal cancer, case 389, second metastasis\",\"Example: HROC389_Met2 = Rostock, colorectal cancer, case 389, second metastasis\"\nTable 1: Definition of the sample ID.\nStore the patient consent in electronic and paper form together with the tumor-ID.\nGather as much clinical data as possible and store them anonymized and separately.\nUse a data management software (e.g., Freezerworks) or other and create an interface with a label printing software to generate temperature-resistant, self-sticking bar code labels.\nAdd a new sample by opening the data management software, define the specimen type and record the following information: tumor ID, tissue type, freezing method, date, responsible employee, passage number, mouse ID and mouse strain.\nAssign the samples to specific positions in the storage tank.",
    "Tracing and monitoring of PDX (Applies to step 7-8)\n\t\nUse a MS Access data base (or a similar system) on a portable, Bluetooth-enabled device (laptop or tablet) to record tumor ID, date of implantation, date of euthanasia, mouse age and strain as well as tumor growth over time.\nConnect the microchip reader to the device and read out the microchip prior to implantation.\nAssign a specific ID to each mouse; we use the following scheme: (see Table 2 below)\nAfter implantation, record the ID together with the mouse characteristics in the data base.\nRe-read the microchip and check, if the specifications of the microchip, the data base and the cryotube label are consistent.\nCreate a label for each mouse cage accordingly.\n\t\tNOTE: To create a physical back up, stick the cryotube labels with the corresponding microchip labels into a booklet and note date and mouse strain.\nTo monitor the tumor growth of the individual PDX, scan the microchip of the mouse with the reader connected to the data base device for identification and record the tumor size measured by caliper each week.\nPlan the ideal time point of PDX harvesting by analyzing the growth curve of the tumor.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nTumor-ID,Prior storage in N2 (=f),Passage (=T) number,consecutive mouse (=M) number\n\"Example: HROP12 fT0 M1 = Rostock, pancreatic cancer, case 12, generated from frozen primary tissue, first passage, mouse 1.\",\"Example: HROP12 fT0 M1 = Rostock, pancreatic cancer, case 12, generated from frozen primary tissue, first passage, mouse 1.\",\"Example: HROP12 fT0 M1 = Rostock, pancreatic cancer, case 12, generated from frozen primary tissue, first passage, mouse 1.\",\"Example: HROP12 fT0 M1 = Rostock, pancreatic cancer, case 12, generated from frozen primary tissue, first passage, mouse 1.\"\nTable 2: Definition of the PDX ID."
