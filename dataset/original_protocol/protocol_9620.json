    "NOTE: All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University and performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Cryopreserved human UCMSCs that were obtained from a commercial source were used for the present study (see Table of Materials). The use of human cells was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University. UCMSCs were taken as an example to describe the procedure. The cranial defect was taken as an example for showing the need of repair to describe the implantation procedure. All the experiments were repeated three times.\n1. Construction of UCMSC aggregates\nPreparation and culture of UCMSCs\n\t\nAdd 10 mL of prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into a new 15 mL centrifugal tube in a sterile biosafety cabinet.\nRemove the freezing tube containing frozen UCMSCs from liquid nitrogen and quickly place it into a 37 °C water bath. Shake the tube gently to facilitate rapid and thorough cell thawing.\n\t\tCAUTION: The whole procedure must be finished within 1 min, because dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the freezing solution may cause cytotoxicity.\nSlightly suspend the cells in the freezing tube and transfer all the contents into the centrifuge tube containing 10 mL of PBS (step 1.1.1). Centrifuge the sample at 100 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and wash the cells with 10 mL of PBS.\nCentrifuge the sample at 100 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant, and gently resuspend the cells with complete alpha-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 584 mg/L glutamine.",
    "Seed the resuspended cells in 10 cm culture dishes (often one to two dishes for one tube, depending on the total amount of cells after centrifugation, at a density of 5 × 106 cells per dish). Add complete α-MEM medium in the dishes to a total volume of 10 mL.\nGently shake the dishes to distribute the cells. Incubate the dishes at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. After overnight incubation,discard the supernatant medium and add 5 mL of PBS 1-2x to remove the nonadherent cells. Add 10 mL of fresh complete α-MEM medium. Change the culture media every 2 days.\nFor cell passaging, when the cells reach 80%-90% confluence, discard the supernatant and wash the cells with 5 mL of PBS to remove the medium thoroughly. Incubate the cells in 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 37 °C for 2 min.\nWhen the cells become round with broken intercellular junctions under a microscope, separate the cells from the dishes without too much disruption of the cell structure. Neutralize the trypsin by adding 4 mL of complete α-MEM medium.\nCollect the cells from the dishes repeatedly and gently by pipetting in a fresh 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the sample at 100 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant, resuspend the cells with complete α-MEM medium, and seed them in fresh culture dishes or well plates. Change the culture media every 2 days.\n\t\tNOTE: According to the size of the defect area, a 25 mm3 defect requires the use of a well of 6-well plate cells cultured to form aggregates.\nFormation and harvest of aggregates\n\t\nPrepare cell aggregate-inducing media by adding 50 µg/mL vitamin C into α-MEM with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 584 mg/L glutamine.",
    "CAUTION: Direct light exposure should be avoided when using vitamin C, as vitamin C oxidizes when exposed to light and becomes ineffective.\nWhen the cells in step 1.1.12 reach 95% confluence (Supplemental Figure S1), change the media to cell aggregate-inducing media; change fresh cell aggregate-inducing media every 2 days.\nAfter 7-10 days of inducing (the length of inducing time depends on the stem cell types and is often ~7 days for the edge of UCMSCs), look for shaped aggregates under the microscope, with thick edges separated from the dish bottom.\nDiscard the culture media and gently wash the cells 2x with PBS. Gently push the aggregates from the edge to the middle using small sterile forceps, folding the aggregates.\nOn some occasion, UCMSCs can spontaneously curl toward the center to form a solid condensation. This structure is equivalent to the aggregate obtained in step 1.2.4.\n2. Morphological identification of aggregates\nGeneral and microscopic observation\n\t\nObserve that the aggregates are dense and integrated and are not easily damaged by mechanical forces, such as pulling during detachment and transplantation.\nUnder a microscope, look for a membrane-like structure of a certain thickness with woven pattern.\nLive/dead cell staining\n\t\nSeed the cells in 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well.\nPrepare 2 µM calcein AM and 4 µM EthD-1 working solution and using PBS.\nAdd 0.3% triton to the cells for 5 min, wash with PBS three times to induce the cells to death, as a control for staining.\nWash the cells, aggregates, and dead-inducing cells with PBS twice.\nAdd 100 µL of PBS and 100 µL of prepared staining solution in step 2.2.2 to each well.\nIncubate the sample for 30 min at RT. Wash the sample with PBS twice.",
    "Add 200 µL of 10 µg/mL Hoechst to each well and incubate the sample for 5 min at RT. Wah the sample with PBS twice.\nObserve under a fluorescence microscope.\nSEM observation\n\t\nSeed and induce cell the aggregates obtained in step 1.2.4 or 1.2.5. Wash the cells with PBS after the aggregates are formed in step 1.2.4. or 1.2.5.\nFix the cells using glutaraldehyde for at least 4 h.\nWash the samples with PBS, then dehydrate through a gradient concentration of ethanol from 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, to 100%, each for 5 min. Treat 2x with anhydrous ethanol.\nImmerse the aggregates in 3 mL of hexamethyldisilazane for 30 min. Aspirate all fluid and naturally dry the samples thoroughly.\n\t\tCAUTION: The whole process needs to be carried out in a fume hood because hexamethyldisilazane is volatile and highly toxic.\nStick the dried samples onto the sample table with double-sided carbon tape and coat the surface with metal. Store the sample at room temperature (RT) for several days.\nObserve under an SEM.\n\t\t\nReplace the sample inside the machine. Adjust the machine voltage to 5 k, and the focal length to ~12 mm. Adjust the focus bar until a clear picture appears.\nCapture the images at low magnification. Adjust the magnification and refocus to obtain a higher magnification image.\n\t\t\t​CAUTION: The surface of the aggregates cannot be touched before observation to avoid destruction of surface morphology.\n3. Histological analysis of aggregates\nFixation and sectioning of samples\n\t\nFix the aggregates obtained in step 1.2.4 or 1.2.5with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for at least 24 h. After the fixation, wash with PBS and place the sample into embedding cassettes overnight to rinse with running water.",
    "Dehydrate the samples using automatic dehydration machines through gradient ethanol, xylene, and paraffin, following the manufacturer's instructions. The whole process is as follows: 85% ethanol for 2 h at RT, 95% ethanol for 2 h at RT, 95% ethanol for 2 h at RT, 100% ethanol for 2 h at RT, 100% ethanol for 1.5 h at RT, xylene for 45 min at RT, xylene for 45 min at RT, paraffin for 30 min at RT, paraffin for 1.5 h at RT, and finally paraffin for 2 h at 60 °C.\nEmbed the samples with paraffin. Prepare approximately 5 µm thick sections, adhere them to cationic slides, and dry the slides for 2 h at 45 °C.\nDewax sequentially through xylene for 15 min, twice, and 100%, 90%, 80%, and 70% ethanol (each for 5 min).\nSlowly rinse the slides 3x with running water for 5 min.\nHE staining\n\t\nStain with hematoxylin for 3-5 min, rinse with water, and carefully remove excess fluid around the tissue.\nFractionate with ethanol containing 1% hydrochloric acid for 3-5 s and rinse with running water, during which the color becomes a little lighter and blue. Remove excess water around the tissue.\nStain with eosin for 1 min, rinse with running water, and remove excess fluid around the tissue.\nDehydrate with 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol for 10 s each, xylene for 15 min, twice, and dry naturally in the fume hood before sealing the sheet.\nAdd neutral resin drops and seal the slides with coverslips. Observe under a light microscope.\nMasson's trichrome staining\n\t\nStain with Weigert's iron hematoxylin for 5 min, rinse with water, and wipe dry.",
    "Fractionate with ethanol containing 1% hydrochloric acid for 3-5 s and rinse with running water, during which the color becomes a little lighter and blue. Wipe the surface dry.\nStain with Lixin red acidic magenta solution for 5-10 min and rinse quickly with distilled water.\nTreat with phosphomolybdic acid aqueous solution for 3-5 min.\nDirectly re-stain with aniline blue solution for 5 min without washing with water.\nTreat with 1% glacial acetic acid for 1 min.\nDehydrate with 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol for 10 s each, xylene for 15 min, twice, and dry naturally in the fume hood before sealing the sheet.\nAdd neutral resin drops and seal the slides with coverslips. Observe under a light microscope.\n4. Implantation\nAnesthetize the nude mouse by an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium.\n\t​NOTE: Confirm the mice are properly anesthetized based on the absence of corneal reflex and limb reaction when the footpad is pinched. Apply eye ointment to prevent dryness.\nCut out a transverse incision (~3-4 cm) in the skin behind the ears of the nude mouse with sterile small scissors after disinfection with iodophor.\nPull the skin forward to expose the cranium. Lightly draw the edges of the planned defect area with an 11# blade and remove the bone fragment. The defect area is a circular area of approximately 4 mm in diameter. Use saline to flush the wound and provide adequate hemostasis.\nDip the aggregates obtained in step 1.2.5 or 1.2.6 with sterile gauze to absorb surface moisture before implantation. Place the aggregates into the area and slightly pressurize to fill the defect.\nReplace the skin after pulling to make sure the implant is fixed. Close the incision with 1/2, 4 × 10 angled stitches and 4-0 sutures.",
    "After the surgery, place the animals on the rewarming blanket until they are active and then return them into the cage.\n\tNOTE: The animals must not be left unattended until they regain sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. The animals that have undergone surgery are not returned to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
