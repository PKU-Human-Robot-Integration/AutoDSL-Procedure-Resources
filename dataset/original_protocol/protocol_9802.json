    "1. Developing uni-lipid vesicles\nThin-film hydration method\n\t\nPreparation and storage of lipid stock solutions\n\t\tNOTE: All steps using chloroform need to be performed in a chemical fume hood. Chloroform should always be pipetted using solvent safe carbon fiber pipette tips. Solutions containing chloroform should always be stored in glass vials.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 10 mg/mL lipid stock solution by adding the appropriate volume of chloroform into the vial containing the lipid powder and mix well. For example, add 20 mL of chloroform to 200 mg of L-α-phosphatidylcholine (egg, chicken) (eggPC). The stock solution may be made at a different concentration if needed.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the powder lipid was stored in an ampule, after adding chloroform transfer to a glass vial with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) lined cap.\nSeal the vial cap with Parafilm and store at -20 °C for up to 6 months.\nFormation of a dry-lipid film\n\t\t\nAdd the appropriate volume of lipid stock solution into a clean glass vial needed for a final vesicle concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. For example, to form 1 mL of egg PC vesicles at 2.5 mg/mL, pipette 250 µL of egg PC stock solution into the vial.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The prepared volume may depend on the extruder process being used (see step 1.3). The mini extruder maximum recommended volume is 1 mL while the large extruder volume range is 5-50 mL.\nRemove chloroform from lipid stock solution using a stream of N2 gas (ultrapure 5.0 Grade).\nTo ensure full removal of chloroform, connect the dried lipid film to vacuum and leave for at least 4 h.",
    "NOTE: The process can be stopped here. If the lipid film will not be used immediately after vacuum drying, store in a desiccator until used. We have observed that these lipid films yield similar quality vesicles after 1 week of storage at these conditions; the vesicle quality following lengthier storage durations, if necessary, should be further explored.\nPerforming freeze-thaw-vortex cycles\n\t\t\nPrepare a Tris sodium chloride (NaCl) buffer solution containing 10 mM of Tris base and 100 mM of NaCl. Rehydrate the dried lipid film with the required volume of Tris NaCl buffer to yield a final vesicle concentration of 2.5 mg/mL and vortex for approximately 15-30 s.\nTransfer the vesicle suspension into a container with dry ice until frozen, approximately 30 min. After the sample is completely frozen, thaw the suspension in a 30-40 °C water bath. Vortex the thawed vesicle suspension.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Liquid N2 may be used in place of dry ice. Transfer the vesicle suspension into liquid nitrogen for 30 s, and then immediately thaw in an 80°C water bath.\nRepeat step 1.1.3.2 an additional 4 times, for a total of 5 freeze-thaw-vortex cycles.\nExtrusion\n\tNOTE: After freeze-thaw-vortex cycles are completed, multilamellar vesicles are formed. Extrusion aids in reducing size and developing large unilamellar vesicles.\n\t\nMini (1 mL) extruder process\n\t\t\nThoroughly clean all components of the extruder using a mild detergent in ultrapure water and rinse at least three times with ultrapure water ensuring all detergent is removed. Dry with N2 gas.\nAssemble the two internal membrane supports and O-rings (inner diameter of 12.7 mm; outer diameter of 15.2 mm). Position each membrane support so the O-ring is facing up.\nPre-wet a filter support with ultrapure water. Place it on the membrane support surface inside the O-ring. Repeat for the second internal membrane support.",
    "Position one internal membrane support into the extruder outer casing. Place one 100 nm polycarbonate membrane onto the internal membrane support, directly over the filter support.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The polycarbonate membranes are stored separately between pieces of blue colored paper. Remove the separating paper before inserting onto the membrane support.\nPosition the second internal membrane support into the extruder outer casing with the O-ring and filter support side facing the polycarbonate membrane. Attach the PTFE bearing into the retainer nut and screw closed with the extruder outer casing. Clip the extruder into the heating block.\nLoad the lipid vesicle suspension into one of the syringes and position the syringe into the extruder heat block, inserting the needle fully into one end of the extruder. Insert the second, empty syringe into the opposite side and lock in both syringes using the arm clips on the heat block.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If needed, place the extruder heat block on a hot plate and set the temperature to a value above the transition temperature of the lipid. Insert a thermometer into the holder built into the heat block for accurate temperature readings and wait until required temperature is reached (~15 min). Egg PC lipid vesicles do not require heat during extrusion.\nSlowly push the vesicle suspension into the empty syringe, and then back into the original syringe. Monitor for pressure-changes throughout the extrusion that indicate a leak. Repeat 20 more times for a total of 21 passes through the polycarbonate membrane. Transfer the lipid vesicles into to a clean glass vial for storage.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The number of extrusions can be optimized depending on the lipid composition.\nIf heat was used, allow for extruded vesicle suspension to reach room temperature. Store the extruded lipid vesicles at 4 °C until further use.",
    "NOTE: The recommended vesicle storage duration is highly dependent on the lipid composition, and the vesicle physicochemical properties (e.g., hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential) should be monitored over time. For example, egg PC vesicles have been stored for at least two weeks with no change in vesicle size or bilayer formation capacity.\nLarge (5-50 mL) extruder process\n\t\tNOTE: Follow steps 1.2.2.1-1.2.2.5 if heat is required for chosen lipid. Skip to step 1.2.2.5 if heat is not needed. Steps 1.2.2.1-1.2.2.4 are not required for egg PC.\n\t\t\nFill a 1 L flask with reverse osmosis (RO) water.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not use ultrapure water to circulate through the 50 mL system as it can cause metal ions to leach from the extruder cylinder.\nPlace the 1 L flask in a water bath on a hot plate and set the hot plate to a temperature above the transition temperature of the lipid.\nAttach the sample cylinder to the flask with flexible tubing via the inlet on the sample cylinder. Attach tubing on the outlet of the cylinder to the top of the 1 L flask. Secure tubing at both the inlet and outlet, as needed. This will create a uni-directional flow of the water through the sample cylinder.\nTurn on the pump to start water circulation. If heat is needed, allow for approximately 30-45 minutes for sample cylinder to reach desired temperature.\nConnect the cap of the sample cylinder to a nitrogen tank via the flexible connector attached to the pressure relief valve unit.\nClean all parts of the 50 mL extruder with 70% (v/v) ethanol.\nAssemble the extruder by placing the large hole screen support, sintered disk, drain disks, and polycarbonate membrane into the space in the extruder lower support. Connect the extruder upper and lower supports using the four screws and tighten.",
    "Attach the extruder unit to the sample cylinder by screwing to the bottom and tightening with a wrench to secure.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If heat is used, place a thermometer into the cylinder and wait until water has reached desired temperature before continuing. This will ensure that the sample temperature is maintained throughout the entire extrusion process.\nFill the sample cylinder with ultrapure water. Extrude the water through the extruder unit prior to adding the sample into the sample cylinder. This is done to pre-wet the membranes, similar to the mini extruder.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Ensure the cap is fully screwed on and the pressure relief valve is closed completely before turning on the nitrogen. Minimal pressure is required for this step (~5-10 psi).\nAdd the lipid vesicle suspension into the sample cylinder and screw the top closed. Slowly increase the pressure until the sample begins to drip from the extruder unit at a rate of approximately 2-3 drops/s into a clean glass vial.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not increase the pressure quickly at this step, as too much pressure may negatively impact the membranes and lead to unsuccessful extrusion.\nOnce all sample has been extruded, turn off the N2 supply and release the pressure in the sample cylinder by opening the pressure relief valve slowly. Pour the lipid vesicles back into the sample cylinder and repeat step 1.2.2.11, 9 more times for a total of 10 extrusions.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The required pressure for extrusion may decrease with increasing number of extrusions, as the sample becomes more homogeneous and closer in size to the polycarbonate membrane pore size.\nStore extruded lipid vesicle suspension at 4 °C until further use.\n2. Characterizing lipid vesicles\nHydrodynamic diameter measurement using dynamic light scattering (DLS)",
    "Vortex lipid vesicles and pipette 50 µL of the lipid vesicle suspension into a disposable low-volume cuvette. Cover to prevent contamination with dust and debris.\nLoad the vesicle suspension into the DLS instrument, input the sample details, and perform the measurement using the associated software.\nZeta potential\n\t\nPrepare a folded capillary zeta cell by washing with ultrapure water, 70% ethanol, and ultrapure water using syringes that connect to the inputs of the cell. Gently push the liquid through the cell 3-4 times and empty the cell completely before switching to the next solution.\nVortex the lipid vesicles and prepare a 1:10 (v/v) dilution of lipid vesicles in ultrapure water.\nLoad the diluted lipid vesicle suspension. Remove air bubbles by pushing the suspension back and forth between the syringes. Attach the stoppers to each inlet.\n\t\tNOTE: It is crucial to remove all bubbles, as this will impact the measurement.\nPlace the zeta cell in the sample chamber, ensuring that the electrodes are in contact. Close the sample chamber top. In the associated software, input the sample details and collect measurement.\n3. Forming a uni-lipid supported lipid bilayer using QCM-D\nSolution preparations\n\t\nPrepare a 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution in ultrapure water. Mix on a stir plate until completely dissolved. Aliquot working solutions of at least 10 mL of ultrapure water, 2% SDS, and Tris NaCl.\nPrepare a dilution of lipid vesicles in Tris NaCl buffer. The concentration of vesicles is dependent on the application. For egg PC, concentrations in the range of 0.01-0.5 mg/mL have been shown to result in successful supported lipid bilayer formation.\nCleaning silica-coated quartz crystal sensors",
    "NOTE: Cleaning QCM-D crystals is dependent on the surface material of the sensor being used. To form supported lipid bilayers, silica-coated quartz crystals are used in this protocol and detailed below as adapted from the manufacturer's standard operating procedure.\n\t\nInsert the silica-coated quartz crystal sensor into the flow module ensuring that the \"t\" on the crystal aligns with the \"t\" on the module. Screw the flow module closed.\n\t\tNOTE: If the QCM-D utilized allows for multiple flow modules to be connected and run simultaneously, repeat the following procedures for the additional modules as needed.\nInsert the flow module into the base of the instrument with the electrodes from the flow module connecting with the analyzer system. Lock the module into place.\nConnect the inlet and outlet tubing to the flow module and pump. Place the tubing into the holding guards and close the lid of the analyzer system. Place a waste container at the outlet of the pump to collect spent solutions.\nTo perform the cleaning, first turn on the pump. Set the flow speed to 400 μL/min. Insert the inlet tubing into ultrapure water and flow 5-10 mL through the module.\nSwitch the inlet tubing into 2% SDS and flow 5-10 mL through the module. Switch the inlet tubing back into ultrapure water and flow 10-20 mL through the module. Remove the inlet tubing from the solution and flow air through the tubing until all liquid is ejected.",
    "NOTE: The cleaning protocol above is used daily before and after every measurement. A thorough cleaning can be performed as needed. Briefly, to perform a thorough cleaning, disassemble the flow modules. All components except for the electrode side of the flow module should be immersed in 2% (w/v) SDS and bath sonicated, followed by thorough rinsing with ultrapure water and drying with a stream of N2 gas. The component of the flow module containing the electrode pins should never be in contact with liquid.\nRemove the sensor from the flow module and rinse the sensor with ultrapure water. Dry the sensor with an N2 gas stream. Dry the flow module with an N2 gas stream. Ensure the electrode always remain free of any liquid.\nIn a chemical fume hood, insert the silica-coated quartz crystal sensor into an ultra-violet (UV)/ozone cleaning instrument. Turn on the instrument and allow treatment for at least 2 min. Remove the sensors carefully and return into the flow module.\nForming a Tris NaCl baseline\n\t\nTurn the analyzer instrument on to connect to the associated software and set temperature to the desired value for the supported lipid bilayer. Allow the temperature to stabilize to the desired input.\n\t\tNOTE: If the set temperature is above room temperature, all solutions should be heated to the same temperature using a heat block.\nConfigure the measurement and find all sensor resonance frequencies and dissipations for overtones 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 before starting the measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: The 1st overtone can be disregarded as this harmonic is overly sensitive and produces noisy data.\nTurn on the pump and set the flow rate to 175 μL/min or the desired experimental flow rate.",
    "Wipe the inlet tubing with ethanol prior to inserting into Tris NaCl. Start the measurement and begin flowing Tris NaCl.\n\t\tNOTE: Data is collected and monitored in real-time. The change from air to liquid in the flow module will be observed in the data collection software by a rapid dissipation change (ΔD) increase and frequency change (ΔF) decrease.\nAllow Tris NaCl to flow through the module for 5-10 min, ensuring that the baseline ΔF and ΔD values in liquid remain stable.\nForming a uni-lipid supported lipid bilayer\n\t\nStop the pump and remove the inlet tubing from the Tris NaCl solution and carefully insert into the lipid vesicle solution. Back flow for 5 s to remove any air bubbles from the inlet tubing, and then continue forward flow. Restart the measurement in the software to zero the baseline.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful to avoid air bubbles in the tubing, which can flow through the module and disrupt bilayer formation and the data recording.\nFlow lipid vesicles until bilayer formation is observed in real-time in the data acquisition software (at least 8 min for egg PC vesicles).\nRepeat step 3.4.1 to change the inlet tubing from lipid vesicles back into Tris NaCl buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: If the desired application is to study molecular interactions, continue directly to step 6.1 without stopping the solution flow or data acquisition. If bilayer formation is the endpoint, proceed to step 3.4.4.\nIn the software, stop the measurement and save the file. Stop the pump.\nClean the flow module and silica-coated quartz crystal sensor following the protocol steps 3.2.4 and 3.2.5.\n4. Forming a suspended lipid bilayer\nNOTE: The protocol for forming a suspended lipid bilayer is adapted from the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) protocol provided by the filter plate manufacturer37.",
    "Solubilize desired lipid in dodecane at 20 mg/mL (e.g., 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)).\nAdd 5 μL of the lipid solution to the donor compartment, which is a porous polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) 96-well multiscreen filter plate (0.45 μm pore size).\nImmediately submerge the filter plate into the acceptor compartment, which is a transport receiver plate containing 300 μL of 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Add 200 μL of 1× PBS to the donor compartment.\n\tNOTE: Controls of filters with lipid only and untreated filters exposed to 1× PBS may be included.\nContinue directly to section 6.2 to investigate molecular interactions with the suspended lipid bilayer. It is recommended to complete the study within 16 h of forming the suspended bilayer.\n5. Developing multi-lipid cell mimicking vesicles and bilayers\nLipid extraction from mammalian cells\n\tNOTE: Lipid extraction follows the Bligh-Dyer approach38.\n\t\nCulture the desired cell line as appropriate. After achieving 70-80% confluence (T75 flask), detach cells using trypsin-ethylenediaminetretaacetic acid at 37 °C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 × g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of ultrapure water.\nAdd 3.75 mL of a 1:2 (v/v) mixture of chloroform:methanol to the cell suspension and vortex for 15 min. Then, add 1.25 mL of chloroform and vortex for 1 min. Finally, add 1.25 mL of water and vortex for 1 min.\nCentrifuge cell mixture at 1000 x g for 10 min. Collect the bottom layer of liquid, which contains lipids in the organic phase. Dry under a stream of N2 gas.\nQuantify the lipid content using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using a C18 reverse phase, 3.5 μm × 50 mm column.",
    "For the mobile phase, prepare two solutions, the first with 60:40 (v/v) acetonitrile:water and the second with 90:10 (v/v) isopropanol:acetonitrile. Ammonium formate should be added to both solutions at a final concentration of 10 mM. Over 60 min, increase the mobile phase gradient from 35% (v/v) of the second solution to 95% (v/v).\nDetect the effluent in negative ionization mode, with consecutive full-scan MS and tandem MS/MS. Identify the individual phospholipid species from their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. Analyze the mass spectra from collision-induced dissociation fragmentation, using LIPID MAPS mass spectrometry analysis tools. Obtain extracted ion chromatograms to integrate the area under the curve, determining the abundance of each lipid species.\nPerform steps 5.1.5-5.1.7 for a lipid standard containing the major lipid classes to determine the relative sensitives of detection for each different phospholipid class.\nDeveloping multi-lipid vesicles\n\t\nFollow steps in 1.1.1 to prepare lipid stock solutions for lipids representing each desired bilayer component, as identified in step 5.1.\nBased on the lipid compositions obtained from step 5.1, add the appropriate volume of lipid/chloroform stock into a clean glass vial needed for a final vesicle concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. Remove bulk chloroform drying solution under a stream of N2 gas.\nFollow steps 1.1.2, 1.1.3, and 1.2 to form multi-lipid vesicles. Follow step 2 for vesicle characterization.\nForming a multi-lipid supported lipid bilayer using QCM-D\n\tNOTE: Some multi-lipid vesicles can result in spontaneous lipid vesicle rupture and bilayer formation similar to uni-lipid PC vesicles presented in step 3. However, more complex multi-lipid vesicles may require external input to aid in vesicle rupture. Here, the AH peptide is used to destabilize the outer leaflet of the vesicle resulting in bilayer formation. Other methods to achieve destabilization and vesicle rupture may be considered if desired.",
    "Follow step 3 to form the multi-lipid supported lipid bilayer utilizing the multi-lipid vesicles formed in step 5.2.\nIf spontaneous rupture of the vesicles into a bilayer is not observed, attempt vesicle destabilization using the AH peptide. Prepare the AH peptide (peptide sequence: H-Ser−Gly−Ser−Trp−Leu−Arg−Asp−Val−Trp−Asp−Trp−Ile−Cys−Thr−Val−Thr−Asp−Phe−Lys−Thr−Trp−Leu−Gln−Ser−Lys−Leu−Asp−Tyr−Lys−Asp-NH2) solution at 13 μM in Tris NaCl with 1% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO.\nFollow steps 3.4.1-3.4.3. After step 3.4.3, change the inlet tubing into the AH peptide solution. Introduce the solution into the flow module until ΔF and ΔD are observed from the new solution addition. Stop the pump and allow the AH peptide to incubate with the vesicles for 10 min.\nSwitch the inlet tubing into Tris NaCl and start the flow to remove the AH peptide from the ruptured vesicles leading to successful formation of a lipid bilayer.\n\t\tNOTE: If the desired application is to study molecular interactions, continue direction to step 6.1 without stopping the solution flow or data acquisition.\nIn the software, stop the measurement and save the file. Stop the pump.\nClean the flow module and silica-coated quartz crystal sensor following the protocol steps 3.2.4-3.2.6.\nSuspended multi-lipid bilayers\n\t\nSolubilize mixture of desired lipids in dodecane at 20 mg/mL.\nMake up a 5 μL lipid mix solution using the desired cell mimicking composition.\nFollow steps 4.2 and 4.3.\n\t\t​NOTE: Continue directly to step 6.2 to investigate molecular interactions with the suspended lipid bilayer.\n6. Molecule interaction studies with uni-lipid and multi-lipid bilayers\nStudying molecular interactions with a supported lipid bilayer using QCM-D\n\t\nPrepare a solution of the desired molecule to investigate adsorption with a supported lipid bilayer. For example, prepare a solution of 200 μM di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in Tris NaCl with 1% (v/v) DMSO.",
    "If the molecule solution is prepared in Tris NaCl, it can be flowed directly following step 3.4.3 for a uni-lipid bilayer or 5.3.4 for a multi-lipid bilayer. If the molecule must be prepared in a different solvent, instead insert the inlet tubing into the desired solvent alone for at least 5 min (e.g., Tris NaCl with 1% (v/v) DMSO for DEHP).\n\t\tNOTE: Viscosity changes due to the solvent can be monitored and considered by flowing it prior to and after introduction of the molecule of interest.\nSwitch the inlet tubing into the solution containing the molecule of interest and flow for at least 5 min. The flow may also be stopped and liquid containing the desired molecule allowed to incubate with the bilayer if desired.\nChange the inlet tubing back to the molecule solvent alone if something other than Tris NaCl. Flow for at least 5 min. Then, switch the inlet tubing into Tris NaCl and flow for at least 5 min.\nIn the software, stop the measurement and save the file. Stop the pump.\nClean the flow module and silica-coated quartz crystal sensor following the protocol steps 3.2.4-3.2.6.\nStudying molecular interactions with suspended lipid bilayers using PAMPA\n\t\nPrepare a solution of the desired molecule. For example, prepare a 200 μM DEHP in 1× PBS with 1% (v/v) DMSO.\nPrepare a new transport receiver plate with 300 μL of fresh 1x PBS per well.\nImmediately following step 3.3 for a uni-lipid suspended bilayer or 4.4.3 for a multi-lipid suspended bilayer, remove the 1× PBS from the donor compartment of the multiscreen filter plate and replace with 200 μL of the test solution. Immediately submerge in the transport receiver plate prepared in step 6.2.2.\nIncubate with gentle rocking for a desired amount of time (e.g., 2 h) at 25 °C.",
    "After incubation, collect 150 μL of the solution from the donor and acceptor compartments. Measure the molecule concentration in both samples using an appropriate method based on properties of this molecule.\n\t\t\nFor example, use a microplate spectrophotometer with the appropriate absorbance wavelength, such as 280 nm for DEHP, and compare with a standard curve of the molecule of interest.\nCalculate the apparent permeability (Papp) of the molecule of interest using the following equations:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62599/62599eq01.jpg (1)\n\t\tWhere imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62599/62599eq02.jpg (2)\n\t\tNOTE: [test compound]acceptor is the concentration of the molecule of interest (e.g., DEHP) at time, t, in the acceptor compartment; and [test compound]initial is the initial concentration of the molecule. A is the membrane area, t is the time, VD is the donor compartment volume, and VA is the acceptor compartment volume.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
