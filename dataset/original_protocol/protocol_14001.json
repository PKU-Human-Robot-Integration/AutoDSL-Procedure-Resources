  "procedures": [
    "The study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol follows the guidelines of an independent institutional ethics committee, and human biomaterials were obtained after informed written consent (ethics committee approval: A 2018-0037).\n1. Positioning of the legs\nNOTE: Patient inclusion criteria included a history of coronary artery disease with elective/urgent indication for CABG surgery and the need for harvesting of at least one venous bypass graft for complete revascularization. Patients with debilitating chronic disease, emergency operations, status post-deep vein thrombosis, and active wet gangrene were excluded. Pre- and post-operative procedures were comparable with previously described clinical studies12,13. 28 patients undergoing CABG were included for antegrade endoscopic vessel harvesting of 30 great saphenous veins from the lower leg after informed written consent. A cardiac surgeon certified and experienced with the technique (>200 cases) for the upper leg executed the antegrade EVH of the great saphenous veins from the lower leg.\nOrganization of the surgical theatre\nBefore surgery, ensure supine position of the anesthetized patient on the surgical table following institutional standard procedures for CABG surgery.\nPlace the vein harvester on the right side of the patient. Place the surgical team and instrumental set-up for cardiac surgery on the left side of the patient. Place the instrumental set-up for EVH near the end of the table (Figure 1, Figure 2; see Table of Materials).\nSpecific positioning of the legs\nPlace two foam rollers (length: 60 cm, diameter: 12 cm) below the extended legs. Place one half-cylindrical foam roller just above the knee in order to avoid overstretched knees and common peroneal nerve lesions. Then, place another full cylindrical foam roller below the Achilles tendon for lifted and outward rotated foot position (Figure 1A-D).\n2. Minimally invasive surgical access to the vein graft\nAccess site",
    "Use institutional standard disinfection procedures with Octenidindihydrochlorid followed by standard sterile covering for aseptic surgical conditions.\nMake one longitudinal skin incision (length: 1.5-2 cm) with a curved scalpel (size 10) on the lower leg. Start the incision with the distance of approximately one index finger above the imagined ankle joint and proceed upwards parallel to the medial margin of the tibia bone (Figure 2C).\nBridging vein harvesting technique\nObtain minimally invasive access to the great saphenous vein with surgical forceps, dissecting surgical scissors, and an electrosurgical pencil, if necessary. Starting from the skin incision, isolate the vessel 4 cm in each direction using a vessel loop, dissecting scissors, small soft tissue retractor, and Langenbeck hook, applying the standard bridging vein harvesting technique (Figure 2C).\nContinuously check vein quality status and surrounding subcutaneous tissue in the working channel. Visualize in order to avoid injury to the saphenous nerve. Avoid harvesting of progressive varicose veins.\nPractical hints\nMake sure that one small finger can easily access the working channel (antegrade). Avoid surgical clipping of side branches at this time.\n3. Antegrade EVH with the optical dissector\nInsertion of optical dissector\nAssemble the optical dissector by connecting an extended length endoscope (diameter: 7 mm, length: 48 cm) to an optical camera and dissection tip from the endoscopic vessel harvesting system, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Moisturize the optical dissector with saline containing heparin (i.e., NaCl + Hep: 5.000 per 200 mL).\nPut the inflatable blocker balloon (also provided by the endoscopic vessel harvesting system and moisturized with NaCl + Hep) over the optical dissector. Gently insert the optical dissector (antegrade) and, after, the inflatable blocker balloon into the wound under permanent optical control of the vein (Figure 2D-F).\nDissection of the vein",
    "Block the inflatable blocker balloon with room air (10 mL). Flood the working channel with CO2 (flow: 5 L/min, pressure: 15 cm H2O) and indicate to the anesthetic medical staff. Make sure that the working channel is extended by the gas pressure.\nMove antegrade until reaching the imagined proximal medial end of tibial diaphysis using the optical dissector, following the manufacturerÂ´s instructions. Gently dissect the main vessel from a majority of subcutaneous tissue until achieving clear identification of side branches.\nFor optimal results, dissect the main vessel through antegrade movement of the optical dissector 1) above of, then 2) below, the main vessel. Then, selectively dissect the side branches, with one side of the vein preserving the perivascular tissue as far as possible, followed by the other side (Figure 2G-I).\nContinuously check vein quality status and mechanical stress in the working channel. Visualize in order to avoid injury to the saphenous nerve. Avoid harvesting of progressive varicose veins.\n4. Antegrade EVH with the optical retractor\nInsertion of optical retractor\nRemove the optical dissector from the wound and disconnect the dissection tip.\nAdapt the blocker balloon for the optical retractor and block the working channel with a 5 mL syringe. Assemble the optical retractor by connecting the extended length endoscope to the optical camera and retractor device from the endoscopic vessel harvesting system, which is provided with an internal bipolar electrocoagulation device (power output: level 3-4).\nUse anti-fog fluid for the tip of the endoscope (Figure 3A-C). Again, moisturize the optical retractor with NaCl + Hep before antegrade insertion through the blocked balloon.\nIsolation of the vein",
    "Advance the optical retractor antegrade to the end of the working channel. Release the vein from the surrounding subcutaneous tissue with the retractor device and selectively interrupt side branches with the bipolar electrocoagulation device in a retrograde fashion (Figure 3D-F). Here, the bipolar electrocoagulation device must be positioned with the convex ending away from the main vessel.\nContinuously check vein quality status and mechanical stress in the working channel. Visualize in order to avoid injury to the saphenous nerve.\n5. Vein graft retrieval\nFinishing of EVH\nExecute a stab incision in the skin with a sharp scalpel (size 11) at the distal end of the dissected vein (regarding venous flow direction). Insert a smooth (anatomical) clamp through the stab incision and clamp the vein under optical control with the optical retractor.\nGently retrieve the clamped vein through the stab incision and cut it off proximally (regarding venous flow direction). Thereafter, gently remove the optical retractor through the blocked balloon simultaneously relieving the distal portion of the vein (Figure 3G). Deflate the blocker balloon and remove it from the wound.\nSwitch off CO2 and indicate it to the anesthetic medical staff. At this time, use surgical clips and interrupt the remaining side branches before retrieval of the vein graft, if necessary.\nFinishing of bridging vein harvesting\nExecute a stab incision in the skin with a sharp scalpel (size 11) at the proximal end of the isolated vein approximately 3 cm above imagined ankle joint. Insert an anatomical clamp through the stab incision and retrieve the vein though the skin incision under digital and optical control. Visualize and avoid injury to the saphenous nerve.",
    "Then, clamp the vein under direct vision and cut off distally (regarding venous flow direction). Thereafter, gently relieve the entire vein graft through the initial minimally-invasive surgical access site and cannulate the proximal end with a 3.0 mm flexible vessel cannula (Figure 3H).\n6. Final preparation of the vein graft\nGently flush the released venous graft with NaCl + Hep (in a 10 mL syringe) alternating with double-clipping of all side branches (Figure 3H). Continuously check vein quality status and repair injuries, if necessary, with polypropylene sutures (7-0 or 8-0). Finally, the vein harvester and primary surgeon must evaluate graft quality of the endoscopic vein, applying the same criteria as is executed for veins harvested by the open technique.\nIf necessary, store the vein graft in a NaCl + Hep-moisturized compress at room temperature (RT) for short-term storage. However, avoid longer time periods of storage. Transfer the vein graft into heparinized blood as soon as arterial cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass is accomplished.\n7. Wound closure\nLigate the main vessel at both clamped vein ends, each with a 4-0 polyglactin 910 suture. Remove the clamps.\nInsert a 10Fr Redon drain into the wound (Figure 3I). Fixate the Redon drain with 2-0 poly ethylene terephthalate suture at the skin.\nExecute subcutaneous and intracutaneous wound closures at the minimally invasive access site with 2-0 and 4-0 polyglactin 910 sutures, respectively. Close the two small stab incisions at the proximal and distal ends, with one U-suture each, stitched intracutaneously (4-0 polyglactin 910). Drape the wounds with sterile plasters.\nWrap the leg, except in peripheral artery disease patients.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
