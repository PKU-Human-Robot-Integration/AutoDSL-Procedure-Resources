  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Animal Experimentation Guidelines of the European Communities Council Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC). The protocol met the ethical guidelines of the French Ministry of Agriculture and Forests and was approved by the local ethics committees (Comité d'éthique pour L'expérimentation Animale Bordeaux n°50112090-A).\nNOTE: During the MR measurements, an adequate level of anesthesia and physiological monitoring (body temperature, respiratory rate) are indispensable requirements.\n1. Animals\nUse male Wistar rats weighing between 350 and 450 g.\nKeep them on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle and provide food and water ad libitum.\n2. Anesthesia\nPrepare the equipment needed for anesthesia (Figure 1A,B, see Table of Materials): a 5 mL syringe containing medetomidine in physiological saline solution (240 µg/kg/h, with a perfusion rate of 20 µL/min), a 0.5 mL syringe containing atipamezole (20 μL, in 0.5 mL of saline solution), and eye ointment.\n\tNOTE: Keep all equipment under the extractor hood, except the 5 mL syringe containing medetomidine, which is placed in the syringe pump near the magnet for anesthesia during MR acquisitions.\nPlace the rat in the induction chamber, start the anesthesia by delivering 4% isoflurane, and adjust the oxygen flow rate to 1.5 L/min.\nEvaluate the depth of anesthesia by assessing the withdrawal of paw reflexes.\nWhen the rat does not respond to stimulation, take it out of the anesthesia box, place it on the bench with its nose in the isoflurane mask, and maintain anesthesia by delivering 2.5% in oxygen at 1.5 L/min.\nGently massage the tail and place the tourniquet (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: The massage can be performed in warm water, with a temperature between 38 and 42 °C, to obtain better vasodilation of the veins.",
    "Insert the peripheral intravenous catheter (22 G), previously heparinized, in the left or right tail vein. Note that a venous return is observed (a drop of blood is visible at the distal part of the needle) when the catheter is correctly inserted (Figure 1D).\nBlow out any air bubbles present in the catheter dead space volume using the 2 mL syringe containing physiological saline solution and heparin.\nApply the eye ointment and prepare the syringe containing atipamezole (17 µg/mL) to awaken the rat at the end of the experiment.\n3. Rat Placement in Magnet for Whisker Stimulation\nPlace a breathing sensor on the magnet bed and then transfer the rat from the bench to the magnet bed. Place it in the prone position with its nose in the isoflurane mask, with the breathing sensor located between the ribcage and the magnet bed.\n\tNOTE: All equipment that enters the MRI room should be MRI-safe.\nDecrease the isoflurane (from 4% to 1.5%–2%) during rat placement and switch the anesthesia to medetomidine at the end of this procedure. Ensure that the right whiskers are free, having cut the right edge at the front of the rat MRI bed beforehand to allow movement of the whiskers.\nHold the rat in position with tape and monitor its breathing which must be between 60 and 80 breaths per minute.\nMake a sail that traps all right whiskers in the paper tape (Figure 2). Align the flexible outlet pipe of the air-puff system along the rat MRI bed so that the part exiting the tube is perpendicular and at around 1.5 cm from the sail. Fix it with paper tape.\n4. Whisker Stimulation",
    "Connect the flexible inlet pipe from a compressed air source (1 bar) to a solenoid control valve input and the outlet pipe to the solenoid control valve output (Figure 3). Ensure that the solenoid control valve stays outside the magnet room.\nPlug the pulsing device into the solenoid valve and into the magnet using the transistor-transistor logic (TTL)-port. Configure it so that the pulsing frequency = 8 Hz, the pulsing time = 20 s, and the resting time = 10 s.\n\tNOTE: These parameters, visualized on the small liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, are adjustable via the three dedicated analogical potentiometers. The electronic pulsing device, which controls the paradigm, must be composed of high-quality electronic components to avoid any drift in time parameters (for correct postprocessing).\n5. BOLD fMRI Acquisition\nPlace the rat brain so that it is in an upright position and use the ear bars to maintain it. Place the volume array coil above the rat’s head (Figure 4A) and fix it using tape. Check that the sail is moving correctly (anteroposterior movement, no rotation, and no friction of sail) when the air-puff system is turned On; then, switch it Off.\nInsert the bed and the coil in the center of the magnet. Check that the sail is still moving correctly once the bed is inside the magnet when the air-puff system is On; then, switch it Off. Switch completely from isoflurane to medetomidine (perfusion rate: 20 µL/min).",
    "Check that the rat is well located using a localization sequence (TE = 2.5 ms; TR = 100 ms; average = 1; repetition = 1; slice = 1 mm; image size = 256 x 256; field of view (FOV) = 50 x 50 mm; scan time = 12 s 800 ms). Drag the Localizer sequence tab into the Instruction name and click on Continue.\nDrag the T2_Star_FID_EPI sequence tab into the Instruction name, center the FOV on the middle of the brain, and click on the Adjustment platform tab to open the edited scan instruction. Record a B0 map and proceed to a scan shim.\n\tNOTE: For a B0 map, use the following parameters: first echo time = 1.65 ms; TR = 20 ms, average = 1; flip angle = 30°; echo spacing = 3.805 ms; slice = 58 mm; image size = 64 x 64 x 64; FOV = 58 x 58 x 58 mm; scan time = 1 m 24 s 920 ms. For scan shim, use the following parameters: voxel selective excitation = STEAM Gaussian pulse; TE = 5 ms; mixing time = 10 ms; acquisition duration = 204.8 ms; bandwidth = 10,000 Hz; dwell time = 50 μs).\nStart the T2 Star_FID_EPI sequence (TE = 16.096 ms; TR = 500 ms; average = 1; repetition = 600; slice = 1 mm; four consecutive slices; image size = 128 x 128; FOV = 20 x 20 mm; bandwidth = 333,333.3 Hz; scan time = 5 min 00 s).",
    "NOTE: Due to the TTL port, an external trigger signal will start the air-puff system at the same time. The paradigm = [20 s activation + 10 s rest] x 10, for the total duration of the 600 scans, 500 ms per scan. The slices are centered on the middle of the barrel field area.\nAcquire another localization sequence (same as the one described in step 5.3) to compare with the first one and check whether the rat has moved during the T2_Star_FID_EPI sequence.\nBring the bed to its initial position, remove the volume array coil, and connect the surface coil.\n6. BOLD Processing\nOpen the T2 Star_FID_EPI file and read the T2 Star_FID_EPI image in Image Display. Open the start-up window of the functional controller, called FunController.\nIn this Processing tab, select the functional imaging window and define the stimulation protocol (duration and alternation of On/Off periods, corresponding to the paradigm used).\nSelect the protocol window (dataset with 600 frames) and insert the value of 40 in the On Period tab and 20 in the Off period tab. Click on the Invert Attribution tab and drag the Stimulation States slider to the left to select the value 1.\nIn the preprocessing window, click on the Median filter in plane for preprocessing and on the Median filter (2D, 3D) for postprocessing.\nClick on the Execute tab and drag the cursors to adjust the overlay lookup table. Visualize the activated brain area (Figure 4B).\n7. Proton MRS Acquisitions\nTo correctly position the surface coil, modify the position of the rat head. Rotate the head (approximately 30° clockwise) so that the surface coil (Figure 5A) can be placed just above the left barrel cortex while being horizontal and located at the magnet center when inside the magnet.",
    "Place the surface coil, fix it on the rat brain using tape (Figure 5B), and check that the sail is moving correctly (anteroposterior movement, no rotation, and no friction of the sail) when the air-puff system is turned On; then, switch it Off at the main switch.\nCheck that the sail is moving correctly once the bed is inside the magnet when the air-puff system is On. Then, switch it Off.\nCheck the rat is positioned correctly using a localization sequence. Set parameters as follows: TE = 2.5 ms; TR = 100 ms; average = 1; repetition = 1; slice = 1 mm; image size = 256 x 256; FOV = 50 x 50 mm; scan time = 12 s 800 ms.\n\t\nDrag the Localizer sequence tab into the Instruction name window and click on the Continue tab to execute the scan program.\nWhen the brain localization is correct, drag the T2_TurboRARE sequence tab in the Instruction name window and click on Continue to execute the scan program. These anatomical images, together with the previous BOLD fMRI acquisition, will allow the correct localization of the voxel in the S1BF for MRS.\n\tNOTE: The T2_TurboRARE parameters are 14 slices, 2 mm per slice, FOV = 2.5 x 2.5 cm, TE = 100 ms, TR = 5,000 ms, matrix = 128 x 128, sequence time = 2 min 40 s.\nDrag the LASER sequence tab into the Instruction name window, place the voxel (2 mm high, 2.5 mm long, 3 mm deep) at the center of the S1BF area.",
    "Use a rat brain atlas and the BOLD fMRI enhancement to localize the zone on the T2 images (Figure 6). Click on the Adjustment platform tab to open the edited scan instruction. Click on the Wobble tab and change the impedance (electronic loading) of the receive coil slightly to tune it. Click on the Apply tab when the tuning is finished to close the instruction editor and apply the changes in the edited instruction.\nRecord a B0 map and proceed to scan shim and, then, perform a local shim.\n\tNOTE: For the B0 map, use the following parameters: first echo time = 1.65 ms; TR = 20 ms, average = 1; flip angle = 30°; echo spacing = 3.805 ms; slice = 58 mm; image size = 64 x 64 x 64; FOV = 58 x 58 x 58 mm; scan time = 1 m 24 s 920 ms. For the scan shim, use the following parameters: voxel selective excitation STEAM Gaussian pulse; TE = 5 ms; mixing time = 10 ms; acquisition duration = 204.8 ms; bandwidth = 10,000 Hz; dwell time = 50 μs. For the local shim, use the following parameters: water suppression, VAPOR acquisition duration = 1,363.15 ms; points = 4,096; bandwidth in Hz = 3,004.81 Hz; bandwidth in ppm = 10 ppm; dwell time = 166.40 μs; spectral resolution = 0.37 Hz/points. The LASER parameters are: echo time = 19.26 ms; TR = 2,500 ms; averages = 128 or 32; scan time = 5 min 20 s or 1 min 20 s; acquisition points = 4,096.\nPerform 1H-MRS.\n\t\nStart the 1H-MRS acquisition first during a resting period (4 x 32 LASER scans + 128 LASER scans; 2,500 ms per scan).",
    "Acquire another localization sequence (same as the one described in step 5.3) to compare with the first one recorded and ensure that the rat has not moved during the LASER acquisition.\nPerform 1H-MRS during whisker activation using the LASER sequence (4 x 32 LASER scans + 128 LASER scans; 2,500 ms per scan) with the air-puff system On (paradigm = 20 s of activation and 10 s of rest).\nOnce again, perform a localization sequence to check whether the rat has moved.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of scans and resting/activated periods can be adapted and modified, but always ensure that the rat is not moving by regularly performing a localization sequence.\nBring the bed to its initial position, remove the surface coil, and move the rat back to the bench. Inject atipamezole into a skin fold made in the rat’s back to reverse the anesthesia and awaken it.\n8. Proton MRS Processing\nOpen the LCModel software and click on the appropriate tab to select the right data type ( Free Induction Decay file) and choose the right file. Click on the OK tab when this is done.\nOptimize the quantification control parameters step by step.\n\t\nIn the Title section, manually enter a title and define an adequate ppm range (e.g., 0.2 to 4.0 ppm) by manually typing in the necessary value in the respective fields.\nIn the Basis file section, select and download the required file to fit the macromolecule baseline correctly (it can be provided by the software provider).\nDefine and load the input control parameters. Prepare the save process of all useful file types beforehand (TABLE = compact tables; PS = necessary PostScript output; CSV = format for spreadsheets; COORD = coordinates for plots). Click on the RunLCModel tab to start the LCModel quantification.",
    "Define selected metabolites to generate statistics.\n\tNOTE: LCModel provides metabolite quantification and estimates errors by a value termed Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). A value with a CRLB < 15 is considered as an optimal quantification. A CRLB > 25 indicates an unreliable value.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
