    "Manufacturing superSIL assembliesNote: This step assumes the use of a mechanical workshop equipped with a laser cutter and drying oven.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191117/20191117092656_5654.jpgFigure 2. superSIL assembly manufacturing process. A. A 3 mm diameter platinum disc with a 1 mm diameter hole laser-cut in the center. B. the assembled disc with superSIL glued in place. Scale bar: 1 mm.Cut a 3 mm diameter circle from the platinum foil using the laser cutter. Drill a 1 mm diameter hole in the center (as shown in Figure 2A).Glue the superSIL into the hole using the cryo-compatible adhesive (as shown in Figure 2B).Cure the assembly in the oven for 24 h at 45 °C.Measure the angle between the flat surface of the superSIL and the flat surface of the platinum disk using the coordinate measuring machine. A flatness of < 1° is essential to minimize imaging aberrations.Preparation of bacterial suspensionsNote: Preserve sterility of your cultures by performing all operations until Step B6 under an MSC or next to a Bunsen burner.The procedure assumes that the selected bacterial strain is expressing a suitable fluorescent protein for SMLM. We have imaged successfully using Enhanced GFP (EGFP) (Wang et al., 2019) and there have been reports of cryo-SMLM using monomeric EGFP and mVenus (Kaufmann et al., 2014).Inoculate one colony of the bacterial strain of interest in 10 ml of LB agar.Add selecting antibiotics depending on selection markers present on plasmid of interest.Grow at 37 °C 220 rpm for 3 h, then check O.D. 660 on a spectrophotometer, using LB medium (Recipe 1) as a blank.If cultures have reached O.D. ~0.6, induce with IPTG 0.2-1 mM (exact amounts will have to be optimized in a case-by-case basis) and culture for 18 h at 25 °C.",
    "Keeping the culture sterile, take 2 ml of culture and transfer them to a 2 ml Eppendorf.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g 10 min, discard supernatant.Add 2 ml PBS, resuspend and centrifuge at 3,000 x g 10 min, then discard supernatant.Resuspend in 100 μl PBS 1x, keep on ice.Preparation of fiducial suspensionsVortex Tetraspeck vial at maximum setting for at least 10 s.Dilute Tetraspeck 1:10 in MilliQ (or equivalent purity) water.Vortex diluted bead suspension at maximum setting for at least 10 s.Keep on ice.Cleaning of superSIL assembliesThis procedure should be used to clean superSILs after each use, before applying a new sample. This makes superSIL assemblies re-usable for a few cycles. Cleaning degrades the glue that attaches the lens to the platinum disk. When the superSIL becomes loose it can be re-attached as described in Procedure A.Important safety advice Piranha solution is highly acidic, oxidizing and exothermic. Do not make more than you need, do not cap the vial where you are making it, and do not store. Always use appropriate PPE. Prepare and use Piranha exclusively under a fume hood. DO NOT mix with organic solvents as this is likely to cause an explosion. Do not use hydrogen peroxide at concentrations higher than 30% or this may cause an explosion. After use, dilute leftovers with plenty of MilliQ water and leave it to outgas and degrade in a fume hood overnight, and then dispose down the drain with plenty of cold water. This procedure is visually demonstrated in Video 1.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. SuperSIL cleaning process Prepare Piranha solution (Recipe 2) as described in Recipes.Spot ~100 μl of Piranha solution of a clean glass slide. Prepare a spot for each superSIL to be cleaned.Using a pair of inverted tweezers, place each superSIL on a spot of Piranha solution, flat face down.",
    "Incubate for 7 min at RT.Using a pair of inverted tweezers, rinse each superSIL thoroughly by dunking it in a vial of MilliQ water and blotting it on clean filter paper. Repeat the dunking and blotting at least three times.Repeat Step D5 once more using a clean vial of MilliQ water.Leave superSILs to dry on a piece of clean filter paper at least 1 h.Glow discharge superSILs flat face up for 120 s at 40 mA in a glow discharger.Plunge-freezingImportant safety noticeThis step of the protocol entails works with cryogenics and with flammable gases, which can cause cryogenic burns, explosions and suffocation by oxygen displacement. Always wear appropriate PPE and make sure you are working in an area with adequate ventilation and oxygen depletion alarms. Always refer to the health and safety guidance on working with cryogenics and with flammable gases available at your facility. Obtain adequate training and/or supervision before commencing work.Procedures will be described assuming the use of a Vitrobot plunge freezer (FEI). Please refer to manufacturers’ instructions for how to translate these for use with equivalent equipment from other manufacturers.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191117/20191117092850_8153.jpgFigure 3. The cryo-bath of the Vitrobot plunge-freezerThis procedure is visually demonstrated in Video 2.Turn on the Vitrobot at the main switch and install the humidity controller.Set humidity at 70% and temperature at 22 °C. Wait until they equilibrate (usually 25-30 min).In the options menu, set blot number to zero and allow the use of footpedal.Note: Automated blotting needs to be disabled to preserve the structural integrity of the superSILs. Fill the outer chamber of the cryo-bath with approximately 1 L of liquid nitrogen. Make sure the “spider” is in place (as shown in Figure 3).Note: Do not fill straight from the handheld dewar, rather use it to fill a smaller thermos flask.",
    "Use the funnel and tissue paper to filter out macroscopic ice crystals that might contaminate your sample.  Wait 10-15 min for the inner chamber to cool down and place grid boxes in the dedicated slots (max 4 boxes, so max 16 samples at any one time).Fit the regulator on the ethane bottle and check for leaks using the leak detector spray.Note: If leaks are detected, close all valves and restart. Use PVDF tape to wrap regulator thread if necessary. Abide by local safety regulations regarding the use of flammable gases.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. SuperSIL plunge freezing process Slowly dispense the ethane into the inner cup and wait until it is almost full to remove the spider. Ethane should be in liquid state for plunge freezing. If necessary, melt solidified ethane by inserting a warm metal instrument into the ethane inner cup.Notes: Orienting a local exhaust ventilation (LEV) head close to the cryo-bath is quite helpful in clearing cold ethane vapor and gauging levels more accurately. he spider needs to be removed for the following passages. Failing to do so might cause significant damage to the machine. Take up a superSIL with the Vitrobot-compatible tweezers, making sure that the flat face is facing the side of your dominant/favorite hand and load it on the shaft.Note: Make sure the tweezers are not proud of the shaft on either side as this can cause serious damage to the machine as the shaft is retracted. Press pedal to retract tweezers into waiting position.Place cryo-bath on the pedestal and press pedal to lift.Once cryo-bath has finished moving, press pedal to lower the tweezers into sample loading position.Apply 2.5 μl of bacterial suspension to the flat side of the superSIL through the side port.",
    "Open the front door and blot away most liquid using a piece of filter paper.Repeat sample application and blotting.Apply 2.5 μl of fiducial solution to the flat side of the superSIL through the side port.Repeat Step E13.Press pedal to start plunging sequence.Once the shaft and the cryo-bath have reached the end of the course, top up liquid nitrogen in the outer chamber, unload the tweezers from the shaft and move the superSIL from the ethane cup into the nitrogen bath.Notes:Extra light from an orientable tabletop lamp is quite helpful at this stage. Take the tweezers out of the ethane slowly to prevent liquid ethane from sticking to the superSIL surface, then transfer quickly in liquid nitrogen. Carefully release the catch on the tweezers and depose the superSIL in one of the slots of the grid box.Warm and dry all instruments using the heated plate or the hair dryer.Note: After each sample, wash the Vitrobot tweezers with 70% ethanol and let dry to prevent cross-contamination of the superSILs. Once all samples have been plunged, fill the transport dewar with liquid nitrogen and allow to settle.Cool down the tube on a string inside the transport dewar.Using cold tweezers, quickly transfer the grid boxes from the outer nitrogen bath of the Vitrobot cryo-bath into the tube.Store samples in a storage dewar filled with liquid nitrogen until ready to image (and no longer than a month).Sample transfer to the cryo-stageimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191117/20191117093001_8240.jpgFigure 4. Linkam cryo-stage layout with lid removedSwitch on the Linkam CMS196M cryo-stage and perform a bake-out cycle.Fill the Linkam Autofill Dewar with liquid nitrogen and couple to the CMS196M stage. Initiate cooling of the cryo-stage.",
    "Once the temperature inside the cryo-chamber has equilibrated to -196 °C, insert the Linkam sample transfer puck into one of the empty receptacles inside the cryo-chamber and allow to cool. Insert a blank sample cassette (as shown in Figure 4).Transfer a storage puck containing your superSIL samples into the remaining receptacle inside the cryo-chamber.Transfer the superSIL assemblies from the storage puck to the sample cassette using tweezers, paying close attention to the orientation; the curved surface of the superSIL needs to point towards the microscope objective once mounted.Once the superSILs have been mounted, close the cassette and transfer it to the brass bridge using the magnetic transfer tool. Remove the storage and transfer pucks from the cryo-chamber to minimize vibration during imaging.Note: It is essential to minimize the likelihood of ice contamination and de-vitrification of your sample during the sample transfer process. Ice crystals may form in humid environments, as a result of condensation from breath and from tools that have not been pre-dried using a heater plate.Finding focusimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191117/20191117093034_1052.jpgFigure 5. Finding focus under bright field illumination. The top of the superSIL curved surface is shown focused in (A), viewed under the 50x, 0.75 NA objective lens. Viewing through the superSIL, characteristic scratches on the flat surface should become visible under bright field illumination, shown in (B), indicating that the sample plane is in focus. Scale bar: 10 µm.Start Micro-Manager and bring up a live view of the camera(s).Switch on the bright field condenser LED built-in to the Linkam CMS196M.Lower the microscope objective in to the Linkam chamber towards the superSIL. Monitor the green channel camera output. Pay close attention to the distance between the objective and superSIL; a collision will likely destroy the Linkam brass bridge leading to large repair costs and delays.",
    "Note: Light from the built-in LED condenser is unlikely to appear in the red channel. As the objective approaches the superSIL, you will notice the brightness of the green channel increase. Adjust the microscope stage laterally to ensure the brightest area remains in the center of the camera’s field of view as you lower the objective further.The curved surface of the superSIL will appear in focus. Translate the microscope stage laterally so the very top of the curved surface is in the center of the camera’s field of view (Figure 5A) and the periphery blurs out of focus.Now lower the objective approximately 1 mm to find the virtual imaging plane that is located below the flat surface of the superSIL. You will notice inherent scratches in the flat surface of the superSIL appearing into focus first (Figure 5B). If the ice that has been produced in the plunge-freezing procedure is relatively thin, the plane at which the sample is located should be very close to this flat surface of the superSIL.ImagingNote: You have the option to store the collected images in memory or to stream them straight to hard disk. sCMOS cameras produce large quantities of data so make sure you have enough available space before continuing otherwise the system may become unresponsive and crash. A typical dual-color STORM experiment comprising of 10,000 full-frames per channel consumes approximately 10 GB of data. Computer memory equal to or greater than 32 GB and a solid-state hard drive of capacity equal to or greater than 1 TB is recommended as a minimum requirement.Take an optional bright field image snapshot. Switch off the LED condenser.Switch on the required lasers once they have warmed up sufficiently.Open the laser shutter on the microscope to illuminate your sample.",
    "Fine-tune the objective height until the fiducial markers are in focus.Optional: Adjust the micrometer on the TIRF module to increase the contrast from your sample.Start with a low laser power density (~50 W/cm2). Wait for the sample to photo-bleach sufficiently until you see clear well-separated single molecules blinking. Increase the laser power density if necessary until you observe the desired blinking characteristics for your fluorophore of choice. The time that the molecule spends in its emitting bright state should be as low as possible compared to the time spent in the dark state.Adjust the camera exposure time and acquire an appropriate number of frames for your experiment based on your fluorophore of choice and sample conditions. For E. Coli containing eGFP, we chose to acquire 10,000 frames with a 50 ms exposure time.Save the acquired frames as 16-bit unsigned integer TIF stacks.Reverse the “Finding Focus” steps to safely remove your samples from the cryo-microscope stage."
