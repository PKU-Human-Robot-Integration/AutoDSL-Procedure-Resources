    "Preparations: Prepare the chromatin extraction buffer (see Recipes below); 100 μL is required per sample. As one tablet of cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and one tablet of PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitors are needed per 10 mL solution, adjust with +10 mL if more than 10 mL solution is required. Add MG132 to a final concentration of 20 µM (add 2 µL per milliliter of 10 mM stock). Mix thoroughly by vortexing and place on rotator at 4 °C until use. The chromatin extraction buffer should be prepared fresh before each experiment.Cultivate human cervical cancer HeLa Kyoto cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S. For 1.0 × 106–1.5 × 106 cells at time of harvest, plate 6.0 × 105 cells in 6 cm culture dishes, approximately 24 h prior to harvest. In addition to dishes intended for samples and the non-treated control cells, include additional dishes intended for use for barcoding and secondary antibody controls. (Approximately 3 × 105 barcoded cells are needed per sample, and 1.0 × 106–1.5 × 106 cells are needed for the secondary controls at time of harvest.)Note: The protocol may be adapted for other cell types, e.g., we have used RPE and MRC5 cells. Prepare 1 μM EdU in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S at 37 °C and mix well. Remove cell culture media from the culture dishes and replace with 4 mL per dish of the EdU-containing DMEM, 1 h prior to further treatment or harvest in the absence of additional treatment.Notes:  1) Samples intended as barcoding controls and controls for secondary antibodies are not labeled with EdU and are therefore left untreated in this protocol. However, they can be EdU-positive if desired.",
    "2) This step may be omitted if cell cycle phase determination by DNA stain alone is sufficient. Harvest cells:Remove culture medium and wash the cell layer once with 500 µL of trypsin solution or PBS at room temperature (RT).Remove trypsin or PBS solution, add 500 µL of fresh trypsin solution, and transfer the dishes to a 37 °C cell culture incubator. After approximately 1 min, check if cells have started to detach by gently tapping the side of the dish. If the cells still adhere to the surface, place them back in the incubator until detachment is observed.When most cells have detached, resuspend the cells in 4 mL of DMEM and transfer the cell suspension of each dish to separate and labeled 15 mL sterile conical-bottom tubes.Isolate cell pellets by centrifugation at 634 × g for 5 min and remove supernatant.Note: If timing is important, e.g., after DNA damage, add cold medium to the cells after they have detached, keep the 15 mL sterile conical-bottom tubes containing the cells on ice, and spin the cells at 4 °C to stop enzymatic reactions as much as possible prior to extraction and fixation. Extract the cells: to prepare, place the chromatin extraction buffer on ice (in a Styrofoam box with ice) and the 10% formalin solution at RT.Add 100 μL of ice-cold chromatin extraction buffer to each cell pellet, mix by pipetting, and immediately place the tube on ice. Start the timer at 5 min after the first sample and then continue with remaining samples. Time is of essence, so work efficiently. If the incubation period exceeds 5 min, then adjust for all samples to obtain equal extraction time.",
    "When time is up, add 900 μL of formalin to the first sample, transfer to RT, and continue with the other samples in the same pace and order as before. Start the timer at 10 min after the last sample has been mixed with formalin and placed at RT.Isolate cell pellets by centrifugation at 634 × g for 5 min at RT.Resuspend the cells in 500 µL of PBS and continue with staining.Notes:  1) The extraction is a critical step. Fixation must occur rapidly after extraction, or degradation of RNAPII may occur. Within the time window described here, the time prior to fixation is likely more critical to keep constant than the fixation time itself. 2) Samples intended as barcoding cells and secondary antibody controls should also be extracted prior to fixation. 3) When the cells have been fixed and are in PBS, they can be left overnight at 4 °C prior to barcoding and staining. 4) Prior to barcoding, use PBS without FBS to resuspend the cells, as FBS competes with cellular proteins for binding to Alexa Fluor 647 NHS Ester. However, wash steps with PBS without FBS should be avoided as they lead to loss of cells. Stain cells for barcoding:Combine cells from tubes containing cells intended for barcoding from step 4d into one tube. (Approximately 3 × 105 barcoded cells should be prepared per sample.)Add 12.5 μL of LX Alexa Fluor 647 NHS Ester (see Recipes below) per 500 μL of PBS. Mix by inverting the tube and incubate in the absence of light at RT for 30 min.Quench barcoding by adding 5 mL of PBS with 5% FBS, mix well by inverting the tube, and leave in the dark at RT for 5 min.",
    "Spin down barcoded cells by centrifugation at 1127 × g for 5 min at RT.Remove supernatant by suction and resuspend pellet containing barcoded cells with 6 mL of PBS with 5% FBS.Add 5 mL of PBS with 2% FBS to tubes containing samples, secondary antibody controls, and non-treated control cells from step 4d.Distribute the barcoded cells from step 5e equally between all tubes containing samples, secondary antibody controls, and non-treated control cells from step 5f (e.g., for 10 tubes, distribute 6 mL of barcoded cell solution/10 = 0.6 mL of barcoded cell suspension per tube).Stain samples with primary and secondary antibodiesSpin down cells in tubes, now also containing barcoding cells, by centrifugation at 1127 × g for 5 min at RT. Remove most of the supernatant by suction (until approximately 100 μL is left), spin down again, and remove rest of the supernatant with a 200 μL pipette.Note: The second spin is to ensure the staining is as equal as possible between the samples. If this step is omitted, remaining supernatant adhered to the sides of the 15 mL tube may fall into the staining solution and affect the final staining volume, and thus antibody concentrations during staining. Resuspend pellet in 50 μL of detergent buffer (see Recipes) and leave at RT for 5 min.Add 50 μL of detergent buffer with primary antibody: rabbit RNAPII NTD 1:50 (i.e., final dilution 1:100), rat pRNAPII S5 1:50 (i.e., final dilution 1:100), or rat pRNAPII S2 1:50 (i.e., final dilution 1:100). Incubate in the absence of light at RT for 1 h.Notes:  1) The tube with cells intended for use as secondary antibody control is resuspended in 100 μL of detergent buffer without primary antibody. 2) If EdU staining is included, each sample can be stained with one antibody only.",
    "Add 5 mL of PBS with 2% FBS to each tube.Spin down cells by centrifugation at 1127 × g for 5 min at RT. Remove most of the supernatant by suction (until approximately 100 μL is left), spin down again, and remove rest of the supernatant with a 200 μL pipette.Add 100 μL of detergent buffer with secondary antibody: anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 1:500 or anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 1:500. Incubate in the absence of light at RT for 30 min.Label EdU with the Click-iT Plus EdU Alexa Fluor 594 Flow Cytometry Assay kit. Prepare by thawing the reaction buffer additive (10×), fluorescent dye azide 594, and copper protectant.Add 5 mL of PBS with 2% FBS to each tube.Spin down cells by centrifugation at 1127 × g for 5 min at RT. Remove most of the supernatant by suction (until approximately 100 μL is left), spin down again, and remove rest of the supernatant with a 200 μL pipette.Resuspend cell pellet in 100 μL of 1× Click-iT permeabilization and wash reagent (see Recipes) and leave for 15 min at RT.Prepare Click-iT reaction cocktail (see Recipes). This should be used within 15 min of preparation.Add 500 μL of Click-iT reaction cocktail and incubate in the absence of light at RT for 30 min.Add 5 mL of PBS with 2% FBS to each tube.Spin down cells by centrifugation at 1127 × g for 5 min at RT. Remove most of the supernatant by suction (until approximately 100 μL is left), spin down again, and remove rest of the supernatant with a 200 μL pipette.Label DNA with Hoechst 33258.Resuspend cells in 500 μL of flow buffer (see Recipes) containing 2.4 μL/mL Hoechst 33258. Incubate in the absence of light at RT for 15 min.",
