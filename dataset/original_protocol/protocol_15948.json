    "The following provides a step-by-step process in selecting COVID-19 protocols to include in a new study. In this scenario, an investigator has designed an epidemiological study of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority populations. The investigator plans to assess a variety of phenotypes and exposures. The investigator is interested in how minority populations may be disproportionately affected by COVID-19 infections and by impacts due to shutdown mandates. The investigator wants to include high-quality measures, ensure consistent data collection, and be well positioned for data sharing and cross-study analysis when the study is complete.\nThe investigator has designed the study to include collection of basic demographic information and changes that may have occurred since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigator recognizes that using PhenX measurement protocols in the study will facilitate combining their data with other studies that have also used PhenX protocols and will allow them to more readily replicate findings from other studies. The investigator visits the PhenX Toolkit to identify recommended protocols of phenotypes and exposures that could be included in their COVID-19 study.\nMaterials\nComputer or laptop\nInternet browser\n1. Navigate to https://www.phenxtoolkit.org[href=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org] and browse protocols in the COVID-19 Research Specialty Collections (see Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.111#cpz1111-fig-0003]).\n2. Add the entire Ethnicity, Race and Demographics collection to your toolkit. This will display the contents of the toolkit (Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.111#cpz1111-fig-0009]).\n3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select “Add all Essential Protocols to your Toolkit” (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.111#cpz1111-fig-0010]).",
    "After protocols are added to My Toolkit, the Toolkit presents “Essential Protocols” identified by domain experts. For example, “Current Age” is essential to interpreting the results of two protocols: “COVID-19 Related Employment Status,” and “COVID-19 Related Household Finances.” As a result, the investigator clicks “Add all Essential Protocols to your Toolkit,” and these protocols are now added to My Toolkit.\n4. Browse Social Determinants of Health: Core (Fig. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.111#cpz1111-fig-0011]).\nBased upon research needs, investigators can customize their toolkit by returning to the COVID-19 Research Collections page (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.111#cpz1111-fig-0003]) and adding additional collections that might be of interest.\n5. Search the entire Toolkit for additional measurement protocols (Fig. 12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.111#cpz1111-fig-0012])\nOptional: If investigators do not identify a collection of interest by name alone, they can utilize the Search bar at the top of every page to look for specific measurement protocols.\n6. To see additional COVID-19-related measurement protocols already in use, investigators can visit https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/covid19[href=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/covid19] to browse the COVID-19 Protocol Library.\nCOVID-19 measurement protocols and modules can be sorted either by subtopic (Fig. 13[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.111#cpz1111-fig-0013]) or source organization. Source organization and source contact e-mail are also provided. The library is also searchable by keywords.\n7. Once all protocols have been added to “My Toolkit,” click “Select All” or individually select protocols to highlight the protocols of interest.\n8. By selecting “Download,” investigators can choose to download a basic report, a detailed report, a data collection worksheet (multiple language options), or a data dictionary (multiple formats).\n         \nBasic Reports include a listing of all of the protocols in “My Toolkit” and the essential measures associated with them. For each protocol, it lists protocol ID, protocol description, specific instructions, and the protocol text.",
    "Detailed reports include a listing of all of the protocols in “My Toolkit” and the essential measures associated with them. For each protocol, it lists protocol ID, protocol description, specific instructions, protocol text, selection rationale, language, participants, personnel and training required to perform the protocol, equipment needs, standards, references, protocol type, derived variables, and requirements.\nData Collection Worksheet(s) include questions to collect information from research participants.\nData Dictionaries provides definitions of variables and other relevant parameters for a study's data management system. It also provides detailed information about each variable as well as skip patterns that are implemented throughout.\nDownloading in REDCap format allows investigators to upload directly to their pre-existing REDCap data collections"
