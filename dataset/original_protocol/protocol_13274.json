  "procedures": [
    "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Number: AWE-2022-023).\n1. Experimental animals\nTwenty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (7 weeks old, 250-280 g) were housed in standard conditions (room temperature [RT] 20-24 °C, humidity 40%-60 %, and a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle).\n2. Grouping method\nGroup the SD rats into control group (C), FS model control group (M), FS model Tuina treatment group (MT), and FS model oral treatment group (MO), each consisting of 5 rats. Keep 5 rats per cage (same group).\nAfter 7 days of acclimation, immobilize one shoulder of the rats in the M, MT, and MO groups using plaster cast immobilization for 3 weeks to mimic FS as described in the next section.\nAdminister Tuina therapy to the rats in the MT group for 2 weeks, as described in section 4 (Figure 1).\nCalculate the required dosage of dexamethasone for each kilogram of rats (0.0675 mg/day) based on the adult dosage (0.75 mg/day) and the ratio of rat to human body surface area (0.018).\nAdminister daily intragastric dexamethasone solution to rats in the MO group at 0.067 mg/ kg/day at 7:00 AM for 2 weeks.\n\t​NOTE: Use this grouping method to confirm the effect of the Tuina protocol in this study. Perform the grouping method according to experimental purposes in different studies.\n3. Development of the FS model\nAnesthetize rats using tribromoethanol (250 mg/kg, by intraperitoneal injection)11.\n\tNOTE: In accordance with the requirements of the institution's ethics committee, a stock solution composed of tribomoethanol (10 g) and tert-amyl alcohol (10 mL) was stored at 4 °C. Before use, it was diluted to 2% with distilled water.",
    "Apply plaster-soaked bandages to the right shoulder and chest of the rats, keeping the right forelimb at 90° of internal rotation of the shoulder joint for 3 weeks (Figure 2)12.\n\tNOTE: Monitor rats to ensure they can perform normal physiological activities such as walking, eating, and drinking. Refix the plaster bandage if the rats can not perform normal physiological activities.\nConfirm the successful establishment of the FS model by observing the development of symptoms such as stiffness in the right shoulder joint, contraction of the right upper limb, muscular atrophy, and limping in rats13.\n4. Tuina method\nNOTE: Throughout the procedure, the investigator must wear personal protective equipment. Only a single professional Tuina doctor must perform all manipulations (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5).\nTrain by the Intelligent-massage technique parameter determination system, which includes a mechanoreceptor and a computer (Figure 3A).\n\t\nPerform manipulations on the mechanoreceptor and force parameters in three directions displayed through software (Figure 3B).\nUse the thumb finger to perform the rotatory-kneading method in a rotatory movement at a strength of 0.5 kg and a frequency of 100-120 times/min (Figure 3C).\nUse the thumb fingertip to perform the point-pressing method at a strength of 0.5 kg (Figure 3D).\nPerform Tuina on the rats by maintaining the mechanical display mentioned in steps 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 for 1 min.\nHold the rat until it calms down (~2 min). Then, perform the manipulation. Place the rat in the lateral recumbent position, but the position may change based on different manipulation methods.\nUse the right index finger and middle finger to clamp the right forelimb of the rat and flex and extend it several times to determine the positions of the rat's shoulder joint, elbow joint, and humerus.",
    "Knead the right shoulder, forelimb, and back of the rat by clockwise rotation with the thumb pulp at a strength of 0.5 kg and a frequency of 100-120 times/min for 3 min (Figure 4A-C).\n\t\nManipulate the forelimb muscles in the lateral recumbent position.\nManipulate the shoulder and back muscles in the prone position.\nPress acupoint LI15 (Jianyu), SI11 (Tianzong), HT01 (Jiquan,) and LI11 (Quchi) vertically with the thumb fingertip 30 times per acupoint at a strength of 0.5 kg (Figure 4D-G).\n\t\nUse the rat-acupoint atlas to define the location of each acupoint (Figure 5)14,15.\nPress LI15, located in the depression anterior-inferior to the acromial end, in the prone position.\nPress SI11, located in the depression to the infraspinatus fossa at the midpoint of the scapular spine, in the prone position.\nPress HT01, located at the axilla center, in the supine position.\nPress LI11 located in the depression medial to the extensor carpi radialis at the lateral end of the cubital crease in the lateral recumbent position.\nHold the shoulder joint with the left thumb and middle finger, and stretch the forelimb in the adduction, abduction, anterior extension, and posterior extension positions for 10 s (Figure 4H-K).\n\tNOTE: This stretching method must be carried out without resistance in rats.\nPause the Tuina procedure if the rat becomes agitated. Stroke the rat for 10 s to calm it down, and then proceed with the trial. \nPerform the procedure daily for 2 weeks.\n5. Measurement of glenohumeral ROM\nNOTE: It is important to complete the measurement process as quickly as possible to prevent degeneration of the joint capsule tissue.\nRemove the scapula and proximal two-thirds of the humerus en bloc after sacrificing the rat with an excessive dosage of tribromoethanol (3x initial dose, by intraperitoneal injection), exposing the lower edge of the scapula.",
    "Insert an injection needle (1.2 cm x 0.45 mm) along the humeral shaft into the humeral head.\nInsert two injection needles vertically into the upper and lower corners of the scapula on plastic foam wrapped with a sterile surgical sheet.\nAttach a thin thread to the injection needle on the humeral shaft and pull it at the other end with a 5 g force to make it parallel to the humeral shaft. Measure the angle between the lower edge of the scapula and the humeral shaft (Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: To ensure reliable results, have a separate investigator conduct the measurements.\nReport data as means ±standard deviation (SD) using a statistical analysis software application.\n\tNOTE: SPSS software (SPSS, version 25.0) was used here.\nAnalyze the differences between groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nObtain bar graphics using appropriate software.\n\tNOTE: GraphPad Prism 8 was used here.\nAssess capsule pathology using H&E and Masson staining after measurement.\n6. Section preparation\nAfter evaluating glenohumeral ROM, fix whole samples in 4% PFA for 3 days, followed by decalcification in EDTA (pH 7.2) solution for an additional 2 months.\nAfter dehydration, slice embedded tissue blocks containing the samples into 5 µm slices16.\nDry the slice at 65 °C for 60 min.\nDewax the slice.\nSoak the slice in xylene I, xylene II, and xylene III for 7 min, followed by a descending ethanol series (anhydrous ethanol, 5 min; 95% ethanol, 2 min; 80% ethanol, 2 min, and 70% ethanol, 2 min), and finally in ultrapure water for 2 min.\n7. H&E staining\nStain the sections using hematoxylin for 5 min, rinse with 1% hydrochloric acid ethanol for 3 s, and wash with running water for 5 min.\nStain the section with eosin for 3 min and wash with tap water.",
    "Soak the section in an ethanol series (95% ethanol I, 3 s; 95% ethanol II, 3 s; anhydrous ethanol I, 3 s, and anhydrous ethanol II, 1 min) and then immerse in a xylene series (xylene I, 1 min; xylene II, 1 min).\nPlace a drop of neutral gum sealant on each sample. Seal each sample with a cover glass.\nCollect images using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Scale bar = 100 µm).\n8. Masson staining\nUsing an immunohistochemical pen, draw a circle around the sections and then incubate the sections in Bouin's solution for 2 h at 37 °C to mordant. Subsequently, wash the sections with water until the yellow color disappears.\nTreat the samples with lapis lazuli blue dye for 3 min and then wash them with distilled water.\nAfter staining the sections with hematoxylin (Mayer) for 2 min, treat the sections for 3 s in the acidic ethanol differentiation solution. Then, wash the sections in running water for 10 min.\nStain the sections with ponceau magenta dye solution for 10 min and subsequently wash them with water.\nImmerse the sections in the phosphomolybdic acid solution for 10 min.\nAdd aniline blue staining solution to the sections for 5 min, and then wash them with a weak acid working solution for 2 min.\nDehydrate and make the sections transparent as described in step 7.3.\nPlace a drop of neutral gum sealing agent on each section and cover it with a cover glass. Leave the sections in a fume hood to dry.\nCollect images as described in step 7.5."
