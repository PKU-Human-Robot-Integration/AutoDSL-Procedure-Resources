Outline of collecting biotinylated proteins\nThe following step-by-step outline from BirA fusion protein expressing HEK293T cells to biotinylated precipitates.\nTiming: 4 days\nPreparation of samples with sufficient amount of protein biotinylated by the BioID fusion protein is identified by mass spectrometry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). At the starting point, the amount of total protein per sample is about 20 mg.\nNote: Prepare biological triplicate samples to see reproducibility in the next mass spectrometric analysis. All steps hereafter are carried out using DNase/RNase-free tubes that have not previously opened and a tube cap opener, and wearing gloves, face mask, safety goggle and head net, to avoid contamination of the samples, particularly with keratin. Should perform the experiment inside a clean bench.\nPerform cell lysis\nBegin with one 15-cm dish (or three 10-cm dishes) for each sample (HEK293T cells expressing BioID fusion protein or BioID constructs).\nWhen cells reach 80% confluency, change medium to fresh complete medium containing 50 μM biotin (1×).\nIncubate cells for 16 h–18 h.\nCollect the cells.\nRemove medium completely by aspiration.\nCollect the cells by pipetting with 10 mL/dish of PBS/EDTA into 15 mL tube.\nWash the dish one more time with 5 mL PBS/EDTA to collect all residue cells.\nSpin down for 5 min at 400 × g at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the cells twice by spin down for 5 min at 400 × g at room temperature (20°C–25°C) with 10 mL/tube of PBS to remove all residue biotin.\nLyse the cells. This step is to completely disrupt all protein interactions and denature proteins.\nResuspend the cells in 900 μL cell-suspension buffer (the cells need to be completely suspended for sufficient lysis).",
    "Add 900 μL lysis buffer and pipette strongly the solution but avoid making the bubble. Perform this step at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: If it is hard to pipette the solution due to DNA genome releasing, apply a short sonication at 30% amplitude for 15–30 s at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd 180 μL of 20% Triton X-100 and mix by pipetting (to prevent SDS precipitation on ice). From now keep the tubes on ice for subsequent sonication.\nPosition the sonicator probe tip in the sample just above the tube bottom to avoid making the bubble.\nSonicate samples.\nApply sonication for two sessions for 30 s using an ultrasonic homogenizer at 30% amplitude.\nThen let the tube rest on ice for 2 min between each session to prevent overheating.\nDuring the resting time, apply the sonication for other samples after washing the probe tip with 70% ethanol and ultra-pure water.\nAdd 1.62 mL of prechilled 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and mix well.\nRepeat one more session of sonication as mentioned in steps 8 and 9.\nAliquot the sample evenly into three prechilled 1.5-mL tubes.\nNote: This step can be excluded if the rotor for 5 ml tube is available.\nSpin down for 10 min at 16,500 × g, 4°C. Carefully transfer all supernatant of the same sample to a prechilled 5 mL tube.\nNote: Do not disturb the small insoluble pellet on the tube wall when transferring the supernatant.\nMeasure protein concentration by using the DC protein assay kit (microplate assay) with BSA as a standard. Adjust the protein concentration of samples to the lowest concentration samples with the mix buffer. Keep samples on ice until use.\nPerform affinity purification of biotinylated proteins\n(Steps 15–17 are to equilibrate the magnetic streptavidin beads with the mix buffer).",
    "During steps 13 and 14, place three new 1.5-mL tubes in the Tamagawa magnetic stand (TA4899N12). Add 1 mL of the mix buffer to each tube.\nMix the stock of magnetic streptavidin beads well with gentle tapping to resuspend and add 150 μL of beads to each tube prepared in step 15. Wait for 3 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nOnce the beads accumulate at one side of tube wall, remove the supernatant gently by 1-mL pipette.\n(Continue with the samples from step 14).\nDivide 1.2 mL of sample from step 14 to the three tubes containing equilibrated beads.\nResuspend the samples and beads with gentle pipetting.\nIncubate the tube on a rotator at 4°C for overnight (at least 12 h).\nPlace the tubes on the magnetic stand and wait for 3 min to collect beads at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nRemove the supernatant gently by pipetting. Try not to disturb beads on the wall of the tube.\nAdd 1.2 mL of wash buffer 1 to each tube and resuspend beads gently by pipetting.\nRinse the beads with rotation in a rotator for 8 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nRemove the supernatant as described in steps 21 and 22.\n(Pool beads from same samples into one tube).\nAdd 1.2 mL of wash buffer 1 to one of the three tubes and resuspend gently.\nTransfer resuspended sample from step 26 to the second of the three tubes, and resuspend gently. Repeat this step to pool all beads from same samples into one tube in a final volume of 1.2 mL wash buffer 1.\nNote: From this step, it is easy to lose beads, be careful with pipetting (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1528-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The tip to pipetting for beads washing steps (steps 22–31)",
    "The tip should be held at a 30°–40° angle and immersed about 1–2 mm. Move down the tip when aspirating the washing buffer.\nPlace the combined tube on a rotator for 8 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nWash once with 1.2 mL of wash buffer 2 as described in steps 21 through 25.\nWash once with 1.2 mL of wash buffer 3 as described in steps 21 through 25.\nWash once with 1.2 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 as described in steps 21 through 25. (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nRemove the supernatant completely. Do not disrupt beads at the tube wall.\nAdd 110 μL Laemmli SDS sample buffer containing 2 mM biotin.\nSave 10 μL (10% of total) of sample for further analysis by silver stain or western blot (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). 100 μL of sample will be used for mass spectrometric analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1528-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Precipitation of BirA fusion protein Control-BirA and BirA-SLC15A4\nBiotinylated precipitates were visualized by silver staining (left panel) or by Western blot (right panel) (at step 34).\nPause point: If necessary, freeze the sample quickly in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples can be stored at −80°C until performing mass spectrometric analysis.\nPreparation of samples for mass spectrometric analysis of BioID pull-down proteins\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1528-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Outline of mass spectrometric sample preparation\nThe following step-by-step outline from biotinylated precipitates to mass-spec-ready samples.\nTiming: 2 days\nSingle-band focused SDS-PAGE containing whole proteins and its in-gel digestion with trypsin (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nNote: Prepare biological triplicate samples to see reproducibility in the next mass spectrometric analysis. To avoid modification by unreacted acrylamide, the one-day-old gel is used. All steps after are carried out not to contaminate the samples with keratin.\nElute the streptavidin bound proteins with 100 μL Laemmli SDS sample buffer containing 2 mM biotin at 98°C.",
    "Concentrate the samples to the volume of 20 μL with a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator for 2 h at 25°C.\nLoad the concentrated samples onto a polyacrylamide mini gel.\nNote: If there are multiple samples, load each sample onto a gel at a distance to avoid cross-contamination.\nStop the electrophoresis when the dye front migrated from the stacking gel to the separation gel.\nWash the gel three times with 200 mL of ultra-pure water using a shaker and discard the washing solution.\nStain the gel according to the CGP stain method (Yasumitsu et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Pour 50 mL of the CGP staining solution into the gel, and incubate for at least 1 h at 25°C.\nDiscard the staining solution and wash the gel three times with 200 mL ultra-pure water for 1 h to visualize the protein bands. In each lane, a single band is observed as a mixture of all the proteins.\nCut the visualized band into the four pieces using a clean razor blade and transfer them to a 600 μL microcentrifuge tube.\nSoak the gel pieces in 300 μL of de-staining buffer to de-stain CBB G-250. Incubate for 30 min at 37°C and exchange the de-staining buffer until the gel pieces turn clear.\nDehydrate the gel pieces by adding 100% acetonitrile. Exchange 100% acetonitrile until the gel pieces turn white. Discard the acetonitrile and dry the gel pieces completely with a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator for 10 min at 25°C.\nAdd 50 μL of reducing buffer onto the dried gel pieces and incubate for 2 h at 37°C.\nAdd 50 μL of alkylating buffer onto the reduced gel pieces and incubate for 30 min at 25°C. Remove the buffer after alkylation by pipetting.",
    "Wash gel pieces three times with 200 μL of ultra-pure water for 10 min at 25°C. Exchange washing solution with 200 μL of 100% acetonitrile and reswell with 200 μL of ultra-pure water. This step is repeated three times.\nNote: It is advisable to wash over three times to remove any reagents that may affect the subsequent mass spectrometric analysis.\nRemove the washing solution and dehydrate the gel pieces with 100% acetonitrile, Dry the gel pieces with a centrifugal vacuum concentrator for 10 min at 25°C.\nReswell the dried gels completely with 2 μL of 10 ng/μL TPCK-treated trypsin. Add 30 μL of digestion buffer to cover the top of gel pieces.\nNote: The standard protocol is for about 1 μg protein, and the amount of enzyme and buffer are changed according to the amount of protein.\nIncubate samples for 12 h at 37°C to digest with trypsin. The resulting peptides can be stored at 4°C for 1 week.\nPause point: At this time, the peptide mixture can be safely stored at −20°C for one month.\nLC-MS/MS analysis for label-free proteomics of BioID pull-down proteins\nTiming: 1 day\nPeptide mixture generated by carrying out steps 35–50 is analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The obtained data are used for the next label-free quantitative analysis.\nNote: Prepare biological triplicate samples to see reproducibility and all samples are analyzed in the same volume for use in the next step of comparative quantification.\nTransfer the digested peptides mixture to the vials in the LC autosampler and acidify the peptides solution by adding 1% formic acid. Adjust all sample volumes to equal. (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "Analyze the digestion mixtures with a nanospray column (NTCC-360/75–3-105, Nikkyo Technos, Co., Ltd.) using EASY-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
