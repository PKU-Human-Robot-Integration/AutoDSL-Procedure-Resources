    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSpinal cord dissection\nTiming: 2–3 h for a litter of embryos\nDuring these steps, spinal cords are microdissected from mouse embryos collected from pregnant female mice. Specific care is taken to remove the meninges from spinal tissues. A tail snip from each embryo is also taken for genotyping.\nEuthanize the pregnant dam on embryonic day (E) 12 following your institutionally approved method.\nRemove embryos.\nSpray the mouse abdomen with 70% ethanol until hair is matted down.\nUsing scissors, make an incision along the abdominal midline, and remove the uterine horns.\nTransfer uterine horns to a 10 cm dish and rinse twice with ice cold PBS. Then transfer to a new 10 cm dish with PBS on ice.\nUsing dissection scissors and forceps, remove the E12 embryos from the uterus and transfer them into a new 10 cm dish with PBS on ice.\nNote: PBS may become cloudy with blood or other tissue debris. Prepare three 10 cm dishes with PBS per mouse. Transfer the uterine horns to a new dish as needed to clearly visualize and cleanly dissect the embryos.\nSelect the embryos desired for spinal dissection (15 min).\nVisualize the embryos under a fluorescent stereoscope and identify embryos that have fluorescent signals (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1D).\nSave one Hb9::gfp negative embryo as a negative control sample to set the FACS gating.\nNote: Embryos may need to be taken off ice for brief periods of time (several minutes) for this step. Try to limit the time embryos are at room temperature.\nOptional: GFP goggles may also be used to identify embryos carrying the Hb9::gfp reporter.\nTransfer Hb9::gfp embryos to individually numbered wells of a 12 well plate with 2 mL PBS on ice.\nClean forceps thoroughly with 70% ethanol.",
    "Remove a piece of the tail from each embryo with forceps and transfer to a pre-labeled PCR strip tube for genotyping.\nCritical: Clean the forceps by spraying them with 70% ethanol once and wiping down. This should be repeated for each embryo to avoid cross-contaminating samples for genomic DNA extraction.\nNote: You may also submit tail samples for genotyping by RT-PCR based methods (e.g. as provided by Transnetyx, Inc.) as a more accurate post hoc verification of genotypes.\nPerform rapid genotyping (2 h).\nExtract genomic DNA with QuickExtract according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nAdd 100 uL of QuickExtract buffer to each PCR tube with tail snips.\nHeat the samples on a thermocycler to 65C for 8 min.\nRemove from the thermocycler and vortex for 30 s.\nHeat the samples on a thermocycler to 98C for 2 min.\nRemove the samples from the thermocycler and vortex for 30 s.\nNote: Only a very small amount of starting material is needed for genotyping, such as the last 0.5 mm of the tail of an E12 embryo. Using excess tissue (such as 4–5 mm of tail length) may interfere with genomic DNA extraction or subsequent PCR.\nNote: DNA can also be isolated with commercially available DNA extraction kits. Many commonly used kits will produce DNA with high purity, though these kits typically take more time to complete.\nPerform genotyping PCR for miR-218-1 and miR-218-2 alleles\nIf there is any large cellular debris remaining in the genomic DNA, spin the samples down and use the supernatant\nFollow the manufacturer’s protocol for 2× GoTaq Master Mix using the following primers:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1389_1.csv\nStart the thermocycler using the following protocol\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1389_2.csv\nRun the PCR product on an agarose gel to resolve WT and KO bands",
    "Note: The expected frequency of embryos carrying the desired alleles may be 1/8 or lower. Thus, having genotyping results prior to performing FACS will reduce the time required on the FACS machine and the time that samples spend on ice prior to processing. It is helpful to have another lab member set up the genotyping PCR while the dissection and dissociation are ongoing. Performing genotyping prior to loading cells onto the 10× controller is important to reduce the cost of preparing samples of the incorrect genotype.\nPrepare the embryo for removal of spinal tissue (1–3 min per embryo).\nRemove the head and discard by cutting at the indicated position (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1389-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Decapitation and evisceration of thoraco-abdominal contents\n(A) Brightfield image of a lateral view of an E12 embryo. The dotted line designates the optimal location for decapitation to separate the meninges in later steps.\n(B) Embryo after decapitation.\n(C) The embryo was pinned to a Sylgard dish ventral side up using dissection pins securely placed in the proximal area of the limbs.\n(D) Same embryo after evisceration of the thoracic and abdominal contents. Scale bar 1 mm.\nPin embryo ventral side up onto a Sylgard dish filled with ice cold PBS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nEviscerate the contents of the thoracic and abdominal cavities using forceps to first remove the overlying ectoderm, then pinching and pulling organs until they are released from their attachment points (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: These steps are difficult to perform at 4°C since they require working under a stereomicroscope which often does not accommodate ice buckets. Dissection dishes can be pre-chilled on ice and filled with ice-cold PBS to reduce the temperature of the tissues during dissection.\nRemove the spinal cord (2–5 min per embryo).",
    "Remove dissection pins and place the eviscerated embryo dorsal side up.\nSecurely pin each limb to the dish (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nUsing a microdissection knife, cut along the dorsal midline along the full length of the embryo to open the dorsal neural tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCut along the left and right sides of the spinal cord along the full length of the embryo to free the spinal cord from the rest of the embryo (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D). Note that the left and the right hemi-cords are still connected ventrally.\nRemove the meninges.\nNote: Removal of the meninges is technically challenging and may require some practice. The meninges will adhere more tightly to the spinal cord as embryos sit out over time, making meninges removal very challenging. Therefore, it is ideal to be time efficient with dissections.\nPlace the spinal cord on its side and identify the meninges on the ventral surface (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nUsing forceps, gently loosen the meninges from the rostral region.\nUsing one set of forceps, grip the spinal cord gently but securely, so as not to crush the tissue.\nWith another set of forceps, secure the meninges tightly (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nQuickly and smoothly detach the meninges by pulling in the caudal direction (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].\nDiscard the meninges and any non-spinal tissues.\nCritical: Inspect the spinal cord to ensure all the spinal cord regions are intact by placing pins in the ends of the spinal cord. Loss of particular rostro-caudal spinal regions or regions of the spinal cord will affect the capture of the same motor neuron populations across replicates (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D–4G).\nTransfer the spinal cord to a labeled Eppendorf tube with 500 uL PBS and keep on ice.\nRepeat steps 5 and 6 for the remainder of the embryos.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1389-Fig3.jpg",

Scale bar 1mm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1389-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Removal of the meninges from the spinal cord\n(A) The rostral meninges (arrow) is loosely attached to the spinal cord.\n(B) One forceps was used to gently secure the rostral end of the spinal cord and the other forceps was used to firmly grasp the meninges on the ventral side.\n(C) With the spinal cord secured, the meninges was pulled down in a firm and steady motion until completely removed.\n(D) Brightfield image of the isolated spinal cord that is secured to the Sylgard dish with insect pins.\n(E) GFP expression from the Hb9::gfp allele enables visualization of cervical (1), thoracic (2) and lumbar (3) regions of the spinal cord.\n(F and G) Brightfield (F) and GFP (G) views of the lumbar spinal cord at higher magnification enable visualization of the lateral (LMC) and medial motor columns (MMC). Scale bar (A–E) 1 mm; (F-G) 0.5 mm.\nSpinal tissue dissociation and FACS purification\nTiming: 2–3 h (1 h for dissociation and 1–2 h for FACS purification of all samples)\nThe goal of these steps is to dissociate the spinal tissue into single cells for FACS purification of GFP+ motor neurons.\nPrepare Papain dissociation reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nAspirate PBS from spinal cord samples.",
    "Add 1mL reconstituted papain solution (20 units per mL) to each spinal sample, place at 37°C, and set timer for 30 min.\nTriturate the spinal tissue with a P1000 pipette tip about 10 times. If large tissue chunks remain, triturate with a P200 or incubate at 37°C for another 10 min and triturate again until no large pieces remain.\nCentrifugate dissociated cells at 200 rcf for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C) in a spinning bucket centrifuge and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL reconstituted and diluted albumin-ovomucoid inhibitor solution (10 mg per mL) with DNase (10 units DNase) per the manufacturer’s protocol.\nCentrifugate cells at 200 rcf for 5 min at room temperature in a spinning bucket centrifuge and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet in sorting buffer (1:1 Neurobasal:DMEM/F12 without phenol red with 3% Horse Serum and 10 units per mL DNase solution).\nCritical: Sorting buffer must contain DNase or cells may clump, causing yield to significantly decrease.\nNote: The addition of 3 μM DAPI to the sorting buffer can aid in the exclusion of dead or dying cells by FACS gating. Ensure the cells have been incubating in DAPI for at least 15 min. DAPI can be left in the sorting buffer during FACS.\nPass cells through a 40 μm cell strainer.\nSort dissociated cells from each embryo separately on a FACS machine.\nCritical: Setting the gating on FACS machine and maintaining the same gates for all samples is important to reduce variability in motor neuron capture. Motor neuron subpopulations express different levels of endogenous Hb9 protein and, resultingly, of the Hb9::gfp reporter. Therefore, changing the gating settings may enrich or deplete some motor neuron pools.",
    "Collect GFP+ motor neurons into 1 mL chilled sorting buffer (1:1 Neurobasal:DMEM/F12 without phenol red with 3% Horse Serum and 10 units per mL DNase solution) in an Eppendorf tube for single cell RNA sequencing preparation.\nNote: We typically capture 5,000–10,000 motor neurons per E12 spinal cord. The number of motor neurons captured is affected by the age of the embryo, precision of the spinal dissection, and completeness of the papain dissociation.\n10× genomics cell preparation\nTiming: 2–3 days\nQuantify motor neuron cells per volume.\nCalculate the volume of media required to obtain the desired concentration of cells.\nSpin collected cells at 200 rcf for 5 min at 4°C.\nGently remove media to desired volume with 10 uL excess for hemocytometer cell counting.\nMix 5 uL of the cell suspension with 5 uL trypan blue in a separate tube, load onto a hemocytometer, and count cells.\nRepeat once for confirmation of cell count. Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]:\nLoad the resuspended cells into the 10× Chromium Controller following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPrepare sequencing libraries following the manufacturer’s instructions (10× Genomics). In Amin et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], 14 cycles were used for cDNA amplification, and 10 cycles were used for library amplification using V2 reagents.\nPause point: Libraries can be stored at −20C prior to sequencing.\nSequence the resulting sequencing library following the manufacturer’s instructions. In Amin et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], the libraries were sequenced with paired end reads, with a Read 1 of 26 basepairs and a Read 2 of 98 basepairs, on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 at the UCSD IGM Genomics Center.",
    "Note: When performing differential expression with single cell RNA sequencing data, it is important to have biological replicates to limit the detection of spurious associations (Squair et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). We found a WT versus DKO (n = 2,2) comparison with single cell RNA sequencing resulted in pseudobulk differential expression results that detected many of the same differentially expressed target genes as our WT versus DKO (n = 3,3) bulk RNA sequencing results (Amin et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The ability to accurately identify differentially expressed genes will be significantly higher when having even more replicates but will substantially increase the cost.\nPreparing single cell RNA sequencing data for downstream analysis\nTiming: 1 week\nThe goal is to filter out low quality cells and prepare the data for downstream analysis.\nDemultiplex raw sequencing data. In Amin et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], bcl2fastq v2.18.0.12 was used.\nAlign and quantify reads from the samples separately for gene expression using Cellranger version 3 (10× Genomics) using the mm10 mouse transcriptome annotation.\nCombine samples into a single expression matrix using Cellranger’s ‘aggr’ program by equalizing aligned read counts. Use the estimated cell count from Cellranger for downstream analysis.\nImport the resulting UMI matrix and sample identities into R.\nFilter out low quality cells and doublets.\nWe generated a histogram of the number of detected features per-cell. We then selected lower and upper bounds that retained the dominant population of cells in order to eliminate low quality cells and doublets. Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].\nWe also generated a histogram of the percentage of mitochondrial gene expression per cell and selected an upper limit of 8%.\nThese two filters removed 796 cells, leaving 8,247 cells for downstream analysis.",
    "Note: Lower sequencing depths are often sufficient for identifying cellular populations using single cell RNA sequencing, however, higher sequence depths are likely needed for effective differential gene expression testing. We sequenced a total of 1,128,753,214 reads across four samples. After filtering steps, we detected 4762 (median) genes per cell, 21,268 (median) unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell, and 19,410 total genes detected (minimum of three cells).\nPerform dimensionality reduction.\nIdentify highly variable genes (HVG) using a method previously described (Brennecke et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). We used FDR = 0.1.\nNote: If using software such as Seurat, p values may not be provided. You can test a range of HVGs in these steps to see if and how it changes the interpretation of your analyses. Adjusting the HVG cutoff can help reveal detail in the data that you would otherwise miss if all genes were included, or if you use all genes over certain expression levels (as is often done with bulk RNA-seq analyses).\nPerform normalization by dividing each cell’s UMI counts by its respective total UMI count across all genes and scaling by 10,000, resulting in an expression value comparable to TPM in bulk RNA sequencing.\nPerform PCA on normalized and log2+1 scaled UMI using the identified HVGs.\nIdentify significant components by comparing the eigenvalues to the 95th percentile of the appropriate Wishart distribution.\nNote: We used the Wishart method but it’s advisable to observe a scree plot of the eigenvalues and find the “elbow” in the curve as a second opinion. Sometimes the Wishart method will over-estimate the number of significant components.\nGenerate UMAP. We used ‘n_neighbors=20’.",
    "Note: Changing the number of neighbors used in the UMAP algorithm will affect the outcome. Lower values will result in smaller and more numerous groupings of cells (better for fine detail analysis such as finding subtypes of a single cell type) while higher values will result in larger and fewer groups of cells (better for large scale differences such as different cell types). These setting alterations will need to be adjusted to address the specific biological question being asked and the inherent diversity of the cell population that was sequenced.\nPerform dimensionality reduction separately for all cells and the interneuron-excluded subset (if contaminating interneurons are captured).\nNote: Hb9::gfp may have background levels of expression in some spinal interneuron populations and may also be expressed in Hb9 spinal interneurons. Thus, you may capture some interneuron populations despite optimizing FACS gating settings. The transcriptomic identity of interneurons is very distinct from motor neurons and can be clearly distinguished by UMAP clusters or expression of neurotransmitters and transcription factor marker genes.\nPseudo-bulk gene expression comparison\nTiming: 1 day\nThe goal of these steps is to compare and perform differential gene expression of a subset of neurons isolated from mice of different genotypes (e.g., differential expression of medial motor column neurons from control and miR-218 DKO backgrounds).\nWe summed the expression of individual cells within an identified cluster (e.g., medial motor column or phrenic/hypaxial motor neurons) on the gene level into pseudo-bulk expression tables. Each gene’s un-normalized UMI counts were summed into bins based on sample identity and cluster assignment (e.g., medial motor column or phrenic/hypaxial motor neurons) resulting in a pseudo-bulk count matrix (4 samples per cluster assignment) Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\nThe pseudo-bulk expression data were treated like bulk RNA-seq for expression normalization and differential expression testing performed using DESeq.",
    "Perform Sylamer (Bartonicek and Enright, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; van Dongen et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14])\nUse DESeq normalized gene expression for each population by genotype as data input.\nLimit analysis to the top 10,000 most highly expressed genes. Problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9]:\nNote: If the quality and depth of sequencing reads is low, the number of genes included in Sylamer analysis might need to be reduced so that only the genes with the most accurately determined gene expression are included. We used this cutoff (i.e. top 10,000 most highly expressed genes) for both bulk RNA sequencing analysis and pseudo-bulk RNA sequencing analysis from single cell data for consistency.\nRank the genes from highest enriched to lowest enriched in a given genotype (i.e., most highly enriched in WT medial motor column compared with DKO medial motor column neurons).\nObtain a FASTA file of 3′UTR sequences. This can be obtained from UCSC Table Browser for the GENCODE_VM18 database with masked repeats with “N”.\nNote: 3′UTR sequences often contain low complexity repeated nucleotides that can reduce the quality of detection of enriched motifs. Masking repeats is an effective way to reduce this source of spurious correlations.\nFor genes with multiple isoforms, the longest UTR sequence among annotated transcripts per gene was retained.\nNote: For a given mRNA, there can be many annotated isoforms that vary with their 3′UTR sequence length. In any cell, multiple RNA isoforms may be present at varying abundance for a single gene. Despite the complexity and diversity of RNA isoforms, we have found it effective to use the longest annotated UTR sequence for Sylamer analysis. It is also possible to generate isoform abundances (either de novo or annotated) from RNA sequencing data using available software, though we have not found this necessary to obtain robust data from Sylamer.",
    "FASTA sequence files and ranked gene lists were used with Sylamer software (Enright Lab) with the following settings: 8mer search (Markov correction: 5), 7mer search (Markov correction: 4), and 6mer search (Markov correction: 4) including known miRNA seed sequences."
