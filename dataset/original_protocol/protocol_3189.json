In order to minimize interference of endogenous release of bilirubin from neurons and glia by residual blood in brain tissue, cardiac perfusion is first performed to completely flush the brain vessels. This step describes how to perfusion and prepare mouse brain slices. The main purpose of this process is to ensure optimal bioactivity of brain slices.\nPerfusion (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2960-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Cardiac perfusion with ice-cold oxygenated aCSF to flush blood in systemic circulation\nBlood in the general systemic circulation is largely flushed out after cardiac perfusion (from A to B), and successful perfusion is marked by the liver, perioral area, limbs, and tail turn ischemic paleness. (related to step 1).\nAnesthetize mice with 1% sodium pentobarbital (55 mg/kg).\nOpen the thoracic cavity with surgical scissors to expose the beating heart.\nMake an incision to the right atrial appendage with surgical scissors.\nInsert a 22-gauge needle into the left ventricle of heart.\nPerfuse with 20 mL pre-oxygenated ice-cold aCSF with enoxaparin sodium Injection over 10 min by using a 20 mL syringe.\nNote: The aCSF is perfused until the tail, limbs and liver of the mice turned into pale (during which the heart remains beating) before sacrifice.\nNote: The pentobarbital sodium can be replaced with ketamine or gas anesthetic (e.g., isoflurane), etc., but the mechanism and effect of different anesthetic reagents are different, and researchers should carefully choose according to their own experimental needs.\nBrain slice preparation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2960-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Isolation, section and incubation of perfused brain (related to step 2)",
    "(A) Mouse brain is dissected after successful perfusion to remove general circulation blood. Compared with a brain without prior perfusion (left), successfully perfused brain exhibits obvious paleness and absence of visible blood vessels (right).\n(B) Setup panel of the vibratome (Leica Vibrating blade microtome VT1200S), speed: 0.08 mm/s, amplitude: 1.0 mm, and thickness: 300 μm.\n(C) The 300-μm-thick brain slices are incubated with continuously oxygenated aCSF solution in 37°C thermostat water bath for 30 min.\nAfter perfusion, the skin and skull from the base of the neck up to in between the eyes was cut open with surgical scissors to expose the brain tissue.\nThe brain tissue is isolated and the forebrain is dissected and attached onto a specimen tray with 3M Biogel.\nAttach the tray to the vibratome bath and fill the bath with crushed ice.\nPour pre-oxygenated ice-cold cutting solution to the specimen tray and continuously bubbled with oxygen.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nSet the sectioning speed to 0.08 mm/s with 1.0 mm amplitude.\nSet the vibratome frequency to 75 Hz–77 Hz.\nCut 300-μm-thickness coronal brain slices.\nCollect the slices and place into a 50 mL beaker containing 10 mL aCSF and continuously bubbled with oxygen.\nPut the beaker in the thermostat water bath at 37°C and incubate for 30 min for recovery.\nNote: In order to reduce tissue damage during sectioning, the mouse brain is kept immersed in oxygenated sectioning solution throughout the procedure.\nNote: The 3M Biogel can be substituted with other biological glue that does not damage tissue viability.\nOxygen-glucose deprivation model in brain slices\nTiming: 7–8 h\nThis section describes the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) steps. The main purpose of this process is to simulate the ischemia state ex-vivo as much as possible.",
    "After incubation, brain slices are transferred to continuously oxygenated glucose-free aCSF (room temperature, RT) with trimmed pasteur pipette and washed for 10 min to deplete the remaining glucose from the extracellular space RT).\nOptional: A hook made of bent needle can also be used to pick up the brain slice for transfer.\nThe glucose-depleted brain slices are transferred with a bent syringe needle to a foil wrapped, light-shielded 24-well plate, in which 500 μL unoxygenated glucose-free aCSF (RT) and 3 brain slices are added to each well.\nNote: The specific volume of solution and the number of brain slices added in each well can be adjusted depending on the desired purposes and bioactive substances to be assayed.\nPlace the 24-well plate in a hypoxia incubator for OGD processing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2960-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. OGD processing after glucose depletion (related to step 4 and 5)\n(A) Samples 1–3 are placed in the 500 μL glucose-free aCSF containing 24-well plate after glucose depletion.\n(B) The Dynamic O2 and CO2 Sub-chamber Controller, which replaces O2 with N2.\n(C and D) The Celmate CO2 Incubator and 2 steps OGD protocol.\n(E) The real-time variation curve of O2 concentration in OGD processing.\nTurn on the hypoxic incubator and set the temperature to 37°C.\nSetting the control software to execute the hypoxia program (95% N2, 5% CO2), which consists of two stages.\nStage 1: Oxygen decent stage: Continuous N2 infusion, increasing N2 concentration to 95% and transpiring O2 within 10 min.\nStage 2: Hypoxia sustain Stage: Maintain hypoxia for up to 6 h.",
    "During the hypoxia process, 5 μL of glucose-free aCSF is collected into 200 μL PCR tubes at different time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h and 6 h) for the measurements of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) concentration.\nNote: Prior to the glucose-free aCSF collection, gently stir the brain slices to ensure that UCB spreads evenly into the external fluid.\nNote: Eppendorf tubes are temporarily stored at 4°C until use. Avoid light exposure during aCSF’s sample collection and storage.\nUnconjugated bilirubin measurement\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section describes a highly sensitive fluorescent protein-based (UnaG) assay of UCB.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nMaking a standard calibration curve of fluorescence intensity using the artificial UCB solutions.\n50 μL 2 μM UnaG solution and 50 μL the bilirubin concentration gradient solutions (0.09 μM, 0.18 μM, 0.36 μM, 0.71 μM, 1.43 μM, and 2.86 μM) are mixed into 100 μL reaction system which are add into light-shield black 96-well plate (final UnaG concentration 1 μM).\nAdd 100 μL 0.1 M PBS solution without bilirubin as blank control.\nReact in darkness for 10–20 min at room temperature.\nUse microplate reader to measure the fluorescence intensity with filters for excitation and emission wavelengths at 485 and 528 nm, respectively.\nThe standard calibration curve is drawn with bilirubin concentration against fluorescence intensity (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2960-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Time-dependent increase of UCB concentration during OGD treatment of the isolated brain slices (related to step 7 to 10)\n(A) The fluorescence intensity of standard bilirubin solution is labeled with blue background and the standard calibration curve is plotted on the right. The fluorescence intensity of samples 1 to 3 is labeled with green background, while the actual time-dependent UCB concentration in samples 1 to 3 is calculated and labeled with yellow background.",
    "(B) The time-dependent curve of mean UCB concentration of samples 1 to 3 during 6 h of OGD processing in isolated brain slices is plotted.\nNote: The actual fluorescence intensity is reported as the difference between the fluorescence intensity in each reaction well minus the basal (blank) fluorescence intensity of the control well.\nDetect UCB concentrations in samples at different time points.\nThe 5 μL sample is added to 45 μL 0.1 M PBS solution and diluted 10-fold.\nThe 100 μL reaction mixture containing 50 μL UnaG solution (2 μM) and 50 μL diluted UCB-containing samples (for a final UnaG concentration of 1 μM and samples are diluted 20-fold).\nAllow reaction in darkness for 10–20 min at room temperature.\nUse microplate reader to detect the fluorescence intensity with filters for excitation and emission wavelengths at 485 and 528 nm, respectively.\nNote: The actual fluorescence intensity is recorded as the difference between the fluorescence intensity in each reaction well minus the basal (blank) fluorescence intensity of the control well.\nThe specific concentration of UCB in samples at different time points is extrapolated from the standard calibration curve.\nNote: The concentration calculated from the standard curve should be multiplied by 20 to get the actual UCB concentration of the sample.\nFinally, plot the time-dependent curve of endogenous generated UCB during OGD (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B)."
