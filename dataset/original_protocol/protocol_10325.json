    "This protocol follows the institutional ethical guidelines for research on human samples, and informed consent was obtained from all donors involved. Approval for the experiments described here was obtained from the institutional review board of the Antwerp University Hospital (approval number 16/10/120).\nNOTE: Temperature indications are always room temperature, unless specified.\n1. Microfluidics Setup\nPrepare the microfluidic flow chamber channels, tubing, and connecting pins\nResuspend the collagen stock vial by vortex mixing, and then dilute in the isotonic glucose solution provided by the manufacturer to a final concentration of 50 µg/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Use equine tendon collagen, mainly made up of type I fibrils. The equine collagen type I is often referred to as \"Horm\" collagen and is the gold standard for this type of assay, for both historical and biological reasons. Human type III collagen can also be used, but these fibrils coat less well, and the platelet response is not as strong. Other coating surfaces can also be used, such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, thrombospondin-1, or combinations of these3.\nTake a new, disposable microfluidic biochip with eight straight, parallel channels and dimensions, in mm, of 0.4 W x 0.1 H x 20 L. Pipet 0.8 µL of collagen into the channel(s) of the biochip on one end and label this as the outlet. Fill just 5/6 of the channel length so that the collagen fibrils are not coated at the channel inlet, because this can cause clogging, which obstructs an efficient perfusion.\nIncubate the biochip at 4 °C for at least 4 h in a humidified and sealed container.\nTo study tissue factor (extrinsic)-mediated coagulation in combination with the contact pathway (intrinsic), coat the channels with collagen and recombinant human tissue factor (rhTF).",
    "Dilute rhTF in 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered saline (HBS; 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.4, 1:3,000, stock concentration: 4.5 nM).\nRemove the collagen-coating solution via the outlet. Pipet 0.8 µL of rhTF in HBS (dilution 1/500 of stock concentration, final concentration: 9 pM) into the outlet of the channel, filling 5/6 of the channel length, similar to the collagen-coating strategy.\nIncubate the biochip for an additional 30 min in a humidified and sealed container.\nFill the coated channels with blocking buffer (1.0% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (w/v) glucose in HBS), starting from the other end (labeled as the inlet). Fill an equal number of Y-shaped channels with the same blocking buffer in a mixing biochip.\n\t\t\nMake sure all channels and channel arms are completely filled with blocking buffer. Incubate both biochips for at least 1 h in a humidified and sealed container.\nFor each channel in use, prepare two tubing of 8 cm long, one 2 cm long, and one 46 cm long. Place a pin in one end of the three smaller tubing and in both ends of the longest tubing.\nPrepare the rinsing pump\nRinse all pump fluidics and the connected tubing with distilled water.\nDegrease the biochip's casting with a precision dust-free wipe and denatured alcohol to remove prints and dust.\nFill all tubing with blocking buffer before connecting them to the biochips.\nFix the coated biochip on the automated microscope stage. Fix the mixing biochip at the same height as the microscope stage using a laboratory scissor jack.\nConnect the coated biochip with the mixing biochip using the longest tubing, 46 cm long. Make sure both biochips are at a distance so that the tubing forms a flexible but straight line.",
    "Attach a syringe connector pin into the Luer-compatible tubing of the rinsing pump. Connect it to the free end of the 2-cm tubing and fix the other end to the outlet of the coated biochip.\nFix the two 8-cm tubing to the mixing biochip inlet using its pins. Put the free end of each tubing in a vial of HBS. Rinse all tubing and all channels with 1 mL HBS.\n\t\tNOTE: HBS flows from the vial through the 8-cm tubing to the mixing chip and through the 46-cm tubing to the coated chip (flowing from the uncoated to the coated part) due to the pulling force of the rinsing pump. This step removes the blocking buffer and poorly adhered collagen (or rhTF in double-coated biochips).\nPrepare the perfusion pumps\nOpen the driver software of the perfusion pumps. Initialize the pumps by double-clicking on the syringes icon in the software.\nSelect the type of syringe that will be used: 1 mL syringes for the coagulation buffer and 2 mL syringes for the reconstituted blood.\nConnect the syringes to the biochip construction\nDisconnect the rinsing pump and all tubing, except for the one connecting the two biochips. The disconnected tubing is reused in the following steps.\nConnect the 2-cm tubing with its syringe connector pin to the Luer lock of a thick-walled waste tubing. Fill the thick-walled tubing with standard pepsin solution using a syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: The addition of pepsin to the waste tubing inhibits and lyses post-perfusion clotting and therefore prevents clogging of the system at the back end.\nSecure the open end of the thick-walled tubing with a Kocher clamp. Place a suitable waste container with bleach underneath to collect the flow-through.\nFix the tubing with its pin to the outlet of the coated biochip.\n2. Preparation of Blood Samples",
    "Collect blood from a healthy volunteer and separate its components4\nCollect blood in an evacuated ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) container. Use this sample only for performing a complete blood count (CBC) using an automated hematology analyzer.\nCollect blood in evacuated sodium citrate containers. 5 mL of blood is required per channel.\nPlace the sample(s) on a horizontal rotator pending blood reconstitution.\n\t\tNOTE: The assay should be completed within 3 h of phlebotomy. Platelet concentrate and whole-blood samples are ABO/RhD blood group matched.\nCentrifuge for 13 min at 250 x g to prepare platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Do not use the centrifuge brake to prevent disturbance of the loosely packed pellet.\nTransfer the PRP to a fresh conical centrifugation tube. Centrifuge for 10 min at 4,500 x g (with brake) to pellet the platelets and prepare platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Discard the platelet pellet. Incubate the PPP in a water bath at 37 °C.\nTransfer the packed red blood cells to a fresh conical tube by perforating the bottom of the original one with a 21 G needle.\n\t\tNOTE: The residual platelet count in the packed red cell fraction is 11 ±4 x 103 per µL (mean ± SD, n = 10).\nReconstitute blood\nDetermine the hematocrit of the packed red blood cells prepared in step 2.1.6 using an automated hematology analyzer.\nDetermine the platelet concentration of the platelet concentrate that will be used for analysis using an automated hematology analyzer.\nCalculate the volume of packed red blood cells, platelet concentrate, and PPP that will yield a 40% hematocrit and 250 x 103 platelets/µL in a 2.5 mL final volume. Mix these to prepare reconstituted blood and perform a CBC.\n\t\tNOTE: Other target titers of cells can be used, depending on the research question.",
    "Prepare a \"blank\" control sample in which the volume of platelet concentrate is replaced by the same volume of saline to determine the concentration of \"endogenous\" platelets (i.e., non-blood bank platelets).\nLabel the reconstituted blood for platelets and fibrinogen\nPipet 13 µL of a 10.7 mg/mL solution of Alexa Fluor 405-labeled fibrinogen (70 µg/mL final concentration) in a test tube and add 1 mL of reconstituted blood.\n\t\tNOTE: Fibrinogen was labeled using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's manual.\nMix another 1 mL of reconstituted blood in a test tube containing 2 µL of 1 mM DiOC6 (1 µM final concentration) or containing 2 µL of 5 mM Calcein AM (5 µM final concentration). Add this to the tube containing the blood with fibrinogen, giving a final volume of 2 mL of platelet- and fibrinogen-stained blood.\n\t\tNOTE: The choice of dye can depend on the research question or the preference of the researcher5. Be aware that excitation of any dye can cause photochemical artifacts.\nGently mix by inverting. Incubate the sample for 10 min at 37 °C.\nPrepare the coagulation buffer\nPrepare coagulation buffer containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 3.75 mM MgCl2 in HBS. Prepare 1 mL of coagulation buffer for one channel.\nFilter-sterilize the coagulation buffer through a 0.2 µm filter. Pre-warm this to 37 °C.\n3. Perfusion Assay\nFocus the microscope optics to the collagen fibers adhered to the bottom of the channel. Use phase contrast or differential interference contrast (DIC). Select \"Set current Z for selected tile regions\" in the experiment software to digitally fix the selected focus.\nDefine a region of interest (ROI) in the selected channel using the acquisition software of the microscope.",
    "NOTE: The ROI can be any surface area arbitrarily chosen within a perfusion channel. It is advised not to analyze thrombus formation and fibrin generation close to the inlet and outlet in order to avoid acquiring images of unevenly distributed thrombi. The ROI surface area should contain a significant number of thrombi to allow for the leveling out of signal variability by individual platelets. The location of the ROI in the xy-plane of the channel is always fixed and determined prior to perfusion. If required, the uncoated part of the channel can be included in the analysis to determine if platelets bind nonspecifically to the biochip plastic.\nPrepare samples for perfusion\n\t\nMount a 1 mL syringe containing 1 mL of pre-warmed coagulation buffer in the perfusion pump.\nMix the pre-warmed reconstituted blood by gently inverting and load 2 mL in a 2 mL syringe.\nMake sure all air is removed from both syringes and connect each to an 8-cm tubing using a syringe connector pin.\nPrime the connectors and tubing of both syringes at high speed (400 µL/min) and stop when everything is filled with coagulation buffer or blood.\n\t\tNOTE: By priming the tubing, the coagulation buffer and reconstituted blood will be immediately mixed in the Y-shaped channel of the mixing biochip when starting the experiment, avoiding the introduction of air to the perfusion chambers.\nUsing pins, fix the other end of both tubing to the split legs of the Y-shaped channel in the mixing biochip. The bottom leg is used for perfusing coagulation buffer and the upper leg for reconstituted blood.\nStart the experiment by initiating perfusion at 4.4 µL/min for coagulation buffer and 44 µL/min for reconstituted blood. Remove the Kocher clamp at the outlet of the waste tubing to permit perfusion.",
    "NOTE: Flow rate can be changed depending on the research question. Start a stopwatch to determine the time between the initiation of the experiment and the start of real-time image acquisition.\nRecord images every 10 s for 30 min in real time using the acquisition and experiment software of the microscope. Start recording when the mix of reconstituted blood and coagulation buffer enters the coated biochip mounted on the microscope stage.\n\tNOTE: Other time series can be used depending on the experimental setup. Use a 100X magnification (10X objective and 10X lenses).\n4. Terminating Experiment\nTerminate the pumps and image acquisition after 30 min or earlier, if the signal is saturated. Detach all tubing and syringes and discard them as biohazardous waste.\n5. Data Analysis\nDetermine thrombus growth (green fluorescence) and fibrin formation (violet fluorescence) kinetics with the image analysis software. The following commands are specific for the software used here:\nOpen the plugin Processing: stitching to stitch the side-by-side images per time point.\nOpen the plugin Image Analysis to determine the surface coverage of the platelets.\nOpen the plugin Measure. Define the ROI by drawing a rectangle region including all thrombi and fibrin fibers; in this protocol, the ROI is a rectangle measuring 637 mm2.\n\t\tSelect the tab All Views to include all recorded time points.\nUse Create Tables to automatically generate a spreadsheet that will contain the mean fluorescence intensity value of the selected rectangle region of each time point.\nSave the spreadsheets in xml format.\nOpen a spreadsheet in a spreadsheet program for further calculations.\nSubtract the initial (background) value of all data.\nPlot the fluorescent signal as a function of the perfusion time for both the green (platelets) and the violet (fibrin) dyes.",
    "NOTE: Take into account the time between pump initialization and the actual starting point of image acquisition. Thrombus formation is generally a two-step process in this model: (1) \"slow\" platelet adhesion (i.e., adhesion) to immobilized collagen followed by (2) coagulation-driven thrombus growth with a \"rapid\" increase in both platelet binding (i.e., accumulation) and fibrin deposition (i.e., coagulation) (Figure 1).\nCalculate the slope of platelet adhesion and accumulation by linear regression; this slope yields platelet thrombus growth kinetics in each phase of its formation.\nCalculate the slope of fibrin coagulation and extrapolate this line to intercept the X-axis, determining the moment of onset."
