    "The use of WT and Tg animals was approved and complied in full by the national and international laws for laboratory animal welfare and experimentation (EEC council directive 86/609, 12 December 1987 and Directive 2010/63/EU, 22 September 2010). All the protocols described in this paper follow the animal care guidelines of our institution.\n1. Isolation of Microsomes-associated αS Aggregates from Diseased A53T αS Tg Mice\nPrepare the homogenization buffer which is composed of 250 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, and 1x phosphatase/protease-inhibitors. Keep the buffer on ice.\nHomogenize the fresh or frozen tissue in a 1:10 (w/v) volume of ice-cold homogenization buffer using a Teflon pestle homogenizer, with 10 - 15 strokes.\nTransfer initial homogenate (1 - 2 mL) to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C using a refrigerated centrifuge in order to remove nuclei and unbroken cells in the resulting pellet (P1). Discard P1.\nTransfer the supernatant (S1) to a clean microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge S1 at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C using a refrigerated centrifuge in order to obtain the second supernatant (S10) and the pellet (P10).\n\tNOTE: P10 is a crude membrane pellet that contains mitochondria and synaptosomes. Discard P10.\nTransfer the supernatant (S10) to a polycarbonate bottle (>1 mL) and centrifuge S10 at 100,000 × g, for 1 h at 4 °C using an ultracentrifuge and a fixed angle rotor (90 Ti).\n\tNOTE: The supernatant is the pure cytosol fraction while the pellet, P100, contains microsomes-associated αS aggregates.\nResuspend the P100 pellet with 500 µL of the homogenization buffer.Transfer P100 to a clean microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a refrigerated centrifuge.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend P100 with 100 µL of homogenization buffer.\n\tNOTE: This fraction is the microsomes-associated αS aggregates.\nSonicate samples for 2 s on ice [set output power 1 watt (RMS)]. Store samples at -80 °C.\nThe day after, determine the protein amount using BCA analysis.\n2. Western Blot\nNote: Biochemical characterization of the microsomes-associated αS aggregates is evaluated by Western Blot.\nCast a gradient 4 - 20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel on a vertical electrophoresis apparatus.\nLoad 1 µg of microsomes-associated αS fractions, dissolved in the denaturing sample buffer.\nIn a different well, load 5 µL of protein standard marker.\nRun the gel at 100 V in a Tris/glycine/SDS running buffer until protein marker reaches the end of the gel.\nTransfer proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane using a basic carbonate buffer (10 mM NaCO3, 3 mM NaHCO3, 20% Methanol) O/N at 4 °C, at 200 mA, constant.\nBlock the membrane with PBS-nonionic surfactant 0.05% (PBS-T) with 5% non-fat dry milk on an orbital shaker for 30 min at RT.\nBriefly, rinse the membrane with PBS-T.\nIncubate the membrane with Syn-1 (1:5,000) or pSer129-αS antibody (1:5, 000) in 2.5% non-fat dry milk in PBS-T, O/N at 4 °C on an orbital shaker.\nWash the membrane for 10 min at RT with PBS-T on an orbital shaker.\nIncubate the membrane with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3,000) in 2.5% non-fat dry milk in PBS-T for 1 h at RT.\nWash the membrane for 10 min at RT with PBS-T on an orbital shaker. Repeat 3x.\nObtain the signal through the regular chemiluminescence kits.\n3. Primary Neuronal Cultures",
    "Note: Primary neuronal cultures were prepared from the WT newborn (P0) mouse hippocampus or cortex (Line C57BL/6). The entire procedure, minus the centrifugation steps, is carried out under a cell culture hood, in sterile conditions.\nTreat coverslips (18 mm Ø) with 65% nitric acid solution for at least 12 h at RT.\nRemove the nitric acid. Rinse coverslips twice with PBS 10x and several times with distilled water.\nInsert coverslips in 24-well dishes and coat them with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/mL in sterile distilled water or PBS 1x) for 1 h at 37 °C.\nRemove poly-D-lysine and wash the coverslips three times with distilled water. Store them at 4 °C until needed.\nEuthanize the mouse pups by decapitation and separate the heads from the bodies. Place the heads on dishes and gently dissect the skin.\nBy using fine scissors, open the skull by making an incision at the bases of the brains. Separate the two halves of the skulls and remove them carefully.\nBy using forceps, pinch off the brains from the bases and isolate the cortex and the hippocampus. Transfer them into two separate dishes containing Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) medium containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\nRepeat steps 3.6 and 3.7 for each animal. Be aware that the entire process should not take more than 30 - 45 min.\nMince the collected tissues and transfer them into two 50 mL conical tubes (one for hippocampus and one for cortex) with 10 mL of HBSS medium containing Trypsin 0.1%. Incubate in the water bath for 7 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: No agitation is required.\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 µg/mL DNase to the homogenate to block trypsin activity.",
    "Centrifuge the resulting dissociated tissue at 200 × g for 5 min at RT on a centrifuge and remove the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: The pellet represents the cells dissected from the tissue.\nResuspend the cells in the plating medium, containing 2% B27, 2 mM glutamine, 6 mg/mL glucose, 10% FBS, 12.5 µM glutamate and 10 µg/mL gentamicin.\nPlate dissociated neurons on poly-D-Lysine coverslips in 24 well plates according to the ratio: 1 cortex/12 wells and 1 hippocampus/6 wells, resulting in approximately 150,000/200,000 cells per well. Maintain the cells in the incubator at 37 °C.\nThe day after (day in vitro, DIV 1), replace the plating medium with the medium containing 2% B27, 10 µg/mL gentamicin and 2 mM glutamine.\nAt DIV 2, remove 1/3 of medium and add 1/3 of the fresh medium containing 2.5 µM cytosine arabinoside for 48 h to reduce the glial contamination.\nMaintain neurons at 37 °C and replace half of the medium every three days.\n4. Neurons Treatment\nNote: The treatment has been performed at DIV 7. All the steps are carried on under a cell culture hood in sterile conditions. An example of cortical neuronal culture density at DIV 7 is illustrated in Figure 1.\nPool microsomes-associated αS aggregates obtained from the spinal cord of three different diseased Tg mice in order to have a 1 µg/µL solution, using the original homogenization buffer for the dilution.\nRemove 1/3 of the medium and replace it gently with the fresh medium containing 2% B27, 1x gentamicin and 2 mM glutamine.\nAdd 1 µg of pooled microsomes-associated αS aggregates to the cell medium. Return neurons in the incubator at 37 °C.\nEvery 3 days for 1 week, add 1/3 of fresh medium. Do not replace the medium. Just add it.",
    "After 1 week of treatment, remove 1/3 of the medium and replace it gently with the fresh medium containing 2% B27, 10 µg/mL gentamicin and 2 mM glutamine. Repeat every 3 days.\nFix neurons after 2 weeks of treatment (DIV 21).\n5. Immunofluorescence\nFix neurons with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS 1x and 5% sucrose solution for 15 min at RT without shaking, under a chemical fume hood.\nRemove the fixing solution. Briefly, wash with PBS 1x, 3 times.\n\tNOTE: Perform all the washing steps gently because primary neurons do not stick firmly to poly-lysine coverslips.\nPermeabilize neurons with 0.3% of nonionic surfactant in PBS 1x for 5 min at RT.\nBriefly, wash with PBS 1x, 3 times.\nIncubate neurons with 3% FBS in PBS 1x for 30 min at RT, to block unspecific binding sites, on an orbital shaker.\nIncubate neurons with appropriate primary antibody dissolved in 3% FBS in PBS 1x, O/N at 4 °C on an orbital shaker.\n\tNOTE: syn303 (1:1,000), mouse αS (1:200), pser129-αS (1:1,000) and Tau (1:10,000) antibodies were used.\nRemove the antibody solution and wash, briefly, with PBS 1x, 3 times.\nIncubate neurons with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody dissolved in 3% FBS in PBS, for 1 h at RT in the dark on an orbital shaker.\nRemove the antibody solution and wash, briefly, with PBS 1x, 3 times.\nStain neurons with DAPI solution (0.1 µg/mL in PBS 1x) for 15 min at RT in the dark on an orbital shaker.\nRemove the antibody solution and wash, briefly, with PBS 1x, 3 times.\nMount coverslips on a slide using antifade mounting medium."
