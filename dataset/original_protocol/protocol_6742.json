    "Sample collectionAcquisition of human PBMCs from whole blood (Timing: 60 min) Note: Steps 1 to 6 are performed in a sterile environment using a flow cabinet. Add 15 ml of Ficoll to the Leucosep tube and spin down at 1,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature (RT).Gently load a maximum of 25 ml whole blood per Leucosep tube.CRITICAL:  Make sure the Ficoll is beneath the filter in the tube and that blood does not mix with the Ficoll. Spin down the Leucosep tube containing whole blood and Ficoll at 1,000 × g for 10 min at RT. CRITICAL: Set the deceleration as low as possible to keep the Ficoll gradient separation of the PBMC layer intact. Transfer the whole solution of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), Ficoll and Plasma to a 50 ml tube containing 15 ml RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS.CRITICAL:  The erythrocyte fraction below the filter should be retained in the Leucosep tube. Spin down the 50 ml tube at 400 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. Afterwards, remove the supernatant and resuspend in 1-5 ml of cold (4 °C) RPMI-2% FBS.OPTIONAL:  When performing phosphoflow on fresh PBMCs (non-frozen samples), proceed to Step 9. Count cells using standard procedures (manual or automated) and store not more than 50 × 106 viable cells per vial by adding Freezing medium in 1:1 ratio to the volume in which the cells are held. Add 0.5 ml of Freezing medium to 0.5 ml of medium containing 20 × 106- 50 × 106 cells. Transfer the cells into 2 ml cryovials that are suitable for freezing and immediately freeze the vials at a rate of 1 °C per minute.",
    "CRITICAL:  As DMSO is harmful to cells, slowly add the freezing medium to the cells in RMPI 5% FBS while gently shaking the tube. PAUSE POINT:  Cells can be kept at -80 °C for several weeks or in liquid nitrogen for years.CAUTION: DMSO is a toxic product and should be handled with care and discarded. Vials containing frozen PBMCs are thawed using a 37 °C water bath. Upon reaching the liquid phase, cells are immediately transferred into a 15 ml tube followed by slow addition 10 ml of cold (4 °C) RPMI-5% FBS while gently shaking the tube.CRITICAL:  This transfer should happen immediately when the liquid phase is reached during thawing, as DMSO is harmful to the cells. Spin down at 400 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. Afterwards, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of cold (4 °C) RPMI 2% FBS.Count the cells and plate 5 × 105 cells per well in a 96-wells round bottom plate within a volume of 50 μl RPMI 2% FBS for phosphoflow.PAUSE POINT:  Cells can be kept at 4 °C for 1-2 h before proceeding with the phosphoflow protocol at Step B1. Collection of murine organs (Timing: 15 min per mouse) Mice are sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The protocol allows for other sacrifice methods that do not affect the anatomical region of the organ of interest, including methods that involve anesthetics.Peritoneal lavage. A midline incision over the abdomen is made to retract the skin, keeping the abdomen intact. A 10 ml syringe, containing 5 ml of ice-cold PBS and 5 ml of air, is attached to the 25-gauge × ⅝ inch needle. The peritoneum is subsequently washed by gently flushing and shaking upon full injection for 1 min.",
    "Afterwards, the peritoneal lavage is collected by aspirating the peritoneal cavity with the 10 ml syringe. The lavage is collected in a 15 ml tube and is kept on ice for further processing.Spleen. The peritoneal cavity can be opened to carefully extract the spleen. The spleen is located at the left flank in the abdomen and can be extracted using tweezers.Other organs. Next, the Peyer’s patches can be isolated from the small intestine using curved tip tweezers. Lastly, the femur is extracted by two cuts in the pelvic bone and dislocation of the knee. Harvesting of various other anatomical compartments, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lungs and lymph nodes as previously described (Li et al., 2017). All organs are placed in ice-cold PBS for further processing.Preparation of single-cell suspension of various murine organs (Timing: 15 min per mouse) Spleen tissue is mechanically disrupted using a 100 μm cell strainer on a 50 ml tube and the plunger of a 2 ml syringe. During and following processing of the spleen, strainers are flushed with 5 ml of RPMI 1640 GlutamaxTM supplemented with 2% (vol/vol) FBS (RMPI-2% FBS) to acquire all cells. Peyer’s patches are processed in a similar manner, using a 100 µm cell strainer and a Petri dish. Strainers are flushed with maximal 200 μl of RMPI-2% FBS to acquire all cells.CRITICAL:  It is important to immediately put the tubes with single cell suspension back on ice or place them in the fridge at 4 °C after processing. The femur is processed using a mortar and pestle, crushing the bone and acquiring the bone marrow cells in 3 ml of RMPI-2% FBS. The bone marrow cell suspension is transferred through a 100 μm cell strainer on a 50 ml tube to ensure a single cell solution without parts of bone.",
    "The bone marrow cell suspension is kept on ice for upcoming procedures.Peritoneal lavage cells are centrifuged at 400 × g for 7 min at 4 °C and the supernatant is discarded. Peritoneal lavage cell pellets are resuspended in 1 ml of RMPI-2% FBS and are kept on ice for upcoming procedures.A cell counting sample is taken from all organs to determine the exact number of cells in each sample.CRITICAL: To measure ex vivo basal levels of phosphorylation, cells are kept on ice without any stimulation. Immediately proceed to Step C1. PAUSE POINT: Cells can be kept at 4 °C for 1-2 h before proceeding with the phosphoflow protocol. In vitro stimulation of single-cell suspension (Timing: 30 min-6 h)Stimulation and staining of cells is performed in 96-wells round bottom plates, using 5 × 105 per well (200,000-1,000,000 cells is technically most optimal). 5 × 105 cells per well are transferred in a volume of 50 μl in each well on ice, keeping the cells all time at 4 °C.For stimulation times of less than 1 h, the 96-wells round bottom plate is placed in a water bath at 37 °C. Make sure only the bottoms of the wells are in contact with the water. For stimulation times longer than 1 h, the stimulus is added while the cells are on ice and subsequently incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The optimal stimulation time for phosphotargets in human and murine samples are stated in the original paper (Rip et al., 2020) and Table 2.CRITICAL:  Some phospho-targets in murine B cells, mainly downstream signaling molecules as NF-κB and AKT/S6, are receptive to temperature changes and mechanical stress due to isolation of single cells. Rest these samples at 37 °C, preferably in a CO2 incubator, for 3 h prior to stimulation.",
    "This is critical for optimal detection and sensitivity of the downstream signaling read-outs. The pre-incubation for these targets on frozen PBMCs is not recommendable, as the viability of these cells is lower compared to fresh material. OPTIONAL:  For experiments including in vitro treatment of samples with BCR signaling inhibitors, incubate cell suspensions 3 h at 37 °C with BCR signaling for effective pre-treatment. If the signaling target requires resting, pre-treatment can be performed during this resting time. When stimulating cells in a water bath, wait 1-2 min to let the samples reach 37 °C. Add the stimulating agent by pipetting 50 μl of stimulus to the wells containing 50 μl of sample. The unstimulated control samples are supplemented with 50 μl RMPI-2% FBS as stimulation control. In addition, add 10 µl RPMI-2% FCS containing fixable live/dead viability stain 10 min prior to fixation.CRITICAL:  As the fixable live/dead viability stain is light sensitive and is not optimal in RPMI medium, prepare this solution freshly and add to the cells within 15 min post preparation. Dilute the eBioscience FoxP3 fixation and permeabilization buffer 1:1 with the supplied diluent. When the stimulation time is over, fix the cells by adding 100 μl of the diluted fixation and permeabilization buffer for 10 min at 37 °C.CAUTION:  This product contains paraformaldehyde (PFA), a toxic and mutagenic product. It should be handled with care and discarded as hazardous waste. NOTE:  The supplied fixation buffer is 4x concentrated and is diluted in the supplied diluent by combining both in equal volume. The diluted fixative solution is added in equal volume the cells to reach the recommended working concentration (50 µl of 4× fixation buffer + 50 µl of diluent to the 100 µl of cells in RPMI).",
    "After 10 min of fixation, centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant.Wash by adding 200 µl eBioscience Wash Buffer to all wells and centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant afterwards. Perform this step two times. Proceed to Step D1.CRITICAL:  Two times washing is critical in order to remove all fixation and permeabilization buffer. PAUSE POINT:  Proceed directly to staining for flow cytometry or keep the cells in a volume of 200 µl of eBioscience Wash Buffer at 4 °C. This storage of cells at 4 °C is possible up to 5 days, without impacting the quality of the samples. Fixation of single-cell suspensions for ex vivo measurements (Timing: 30 min)Parallel to stimulated cells, 5 × 105 cells per well are transferred in a 96-wells round bottom plate at a volume of 100 µl per well on ice, keeping the cells at 4 °C at all times.CRITICAL:  This procedure must always be performed at 4 °C, as this is a read-out of ex vivo activation and temperature alterations could be of great influence. Samples are stained with the fixable live/dead viability stain for 10 min at 4 °C in the dark prior to fixation.CRITICAL:  As the fixable live/dead viability stain is not optimal in RPMI medium, prepare this solution freshly and add to the cells within 15 min post preparation. Fix cells with 100 µl of the diluted fixation and permeabilization buffer for 10 min at 4 °C.After 10 min of fixation, centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant.Wash by adding 200 µl eBioscience Wash Buffer to all wells and centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant afterwards.",
    "Perform this step two times.CRITICAL:  Two times washing is critical in order to remove all fixation and permeabilization buffer. PAUSE POINT:  Proceed directly to staining for flow cytometry or keep the cells in a volume of 200 μl of eBioscience Wash Buffer at 4 °C. This storage of cells at 4 °C is possible up to 5 days, without impacting the quality of the samples. Flow cytometry procedures (Timing: 1-2 h)After the last wash at Step B6 or Step C5, supernatant is removed and the staining mix can be added. Cells are incubated with 40 μl mix to intracellularly stain for cell surface markers such as CD3, B220/CD19, IgD and IgM in eBioscience Wash Buffer. An FcR-blocking agent is added to the staining mix to avoid non-specific binding of the antibodies. Cells are incubated in the dark for 30 min at 4 °C.CAUTION:  Sodium azide is highly toxic and dangerous to the environment. It should be handled with care and discarded as hazardous waste. CRITICAL:  Carefully resuspend the pellet in 40 μl mix, ensuring all cells are in suspension. NOTE:  The staining can also be performed for 15 min at room temperature (RT, ~20 °C) in the dark. Samples are washed by adding 200 μl eBioscience Wash Buffer to all wells and centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant afterwards.Incubate the samples with 40 μl eBioscience Wash Buffer containing the phospho-target antibody of choice for 30 min at RT in the dark.OPTIONAL:  If the phospho-target antibody is already labeled with a conjugate, proceed to Step D6 upon completion of the incubation time. Samples are washed by adding 200 μl eBioscience Wash Buffer to all wells and centrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant afterwards.",
    "When the phospho-protein concerns an unconjugated rabbit-derived antibody, incubate with a donkey anti-rabbit PE-conjugated antibody for 15 min at RT in the dark.Samples are washed with MACS Buffer (0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and resuspended in 50 μl MACS buffer. Samples are transferred into insert tubes and measured using a flow cytometer within 1 day.Prior to measuring, calibrate the LSR-II by compensating for all conjugates that are used within the phospho-staining. Preferably use the same antibodies as used in the staining mix and add those to UltraComp eBeads (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer instructions to calibrate the flow cytometer.Acquire a sufficient number of cells to perform B cell subpopulation analysis. This would imply that acquiring between 20,000-50,000 B cells per sample would be sufficient.CRITICAL:  Due to the fixation and permeabilization protocol, the cell size will have decreased compared with non-fixed cells. Increase the voltage of the forward-scatter area (FSC-A) accordingly. Analysis is performed using FlowJo v9 or v10 software."
