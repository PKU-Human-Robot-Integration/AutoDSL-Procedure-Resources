    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing fly food\nTiming: 2 h active time; 24 h total\nAdd appropriate amount of water to kettle/Crockpot and begin heating at medium-high heat bringing to a boil/simmer.\nNote: If using a Crockpot add appropriate amount of water and set to high heat, making sure to close the lid. Typically, 1 liter of food yields about 120 vials, each containing 8 mL.\nCritical: If using a standing mixing element, set it to a medium-high speed and continuously mix the solution. Otherwise, occasionally mix the food by hand every 10–15 min to ensure the dry ingredients do not stick to the bottom and burn.\nMix all dry ingredients together in a large bowl according to the following recipe: 6.4 g agar, 30 g dry active yeast, 70 g cornmeal, 55 g dextrose and 30 g sucrose per liter of water.\nMake sure the dry ingredients are well mixed with no major clumps.\nNote: Dextrose and sucrose, depending on ambient humidity, are prone to forming large clumps which must be broken up completely before addition to the water.\nSlowly sift mixed dry ingredients into the kettle using a large scoop or weigh boat.\nMaintain mixing speed when using a mixing element.\nNote: When no mixing element is available, stir manually after each addition of dry ingredients, ensuring they are fully dissolved before adding more.\nNote: Slow addition of dry ingredients ensures even mixing throughout the solution resulting in a smooth texture of the final food product.\nCook food until agar is fully dissolved.\nNote: Depending on the cooking pot that is used, this may take anywhere from 45 min (electric kettle) to 3 h (Crockpot).",
    "Note: Once the food has reached ∼70°C the agar should be fully dissolved. The resulting product should resemble a thin polenta and have a slightly sweet smell.\nStir throughout the cooking time.\nNote: The user may choose to follow their own cooking style, which will likely yield similar results as long as drugs are added to cool, solidified food after it has been dispensed into individual vials.\nOnce food is cooked, reduce heat allowing the food to cool down to 70°C.\nReduce stirring speed or stir manually on occasion.\nNote: If using a Crockpot, the food will likely not be much hotter than 70°C.\nOptional: To speed up cooling, initial water volume can be reduced, though not the dry components (e.g., 8 liters but ingredients for 10 liters). Missing volume can be added as tap water containing ice by slowly sifting in the appropriate volume using a large scoop to avoid excessive bubbling.\nOnce food has cooled to 70°C, slowly add 20% Tegosept (4 mL per liter) and propionic acid (4 mL per liter).\nNote: Care should be taken in addition to avoid bubbling.\nMaintain stir speed for 5 min.\nReduce heat and stir speed making sure to keep the food liquid.\nAccurately and precisely dispense 8 mL of liquid food into vials using piston pump or alternative method (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nAlternatives: If available pump is not accurate or precise enough, food can be dispensed manually using a Multipipette Repeater.\nTake a 50 mL Combitip. Using wire cutters or similar, cut the tip of the Combitip off (about 1–2 cm). It may also be possible to dispense food using a catheter tip syringe.\nProgram the repeater to dispense 8 mL of food 6 times.\nDispense using cut Combitip.",
    "Note: If Combitip becomes clogged, eject any remaining liquid, eject the tip, manually pump the tip to remove the clog. If still clogged, replace with new cut tip as above.\nAlternatives: If neither accurate pump nor repeater are available an alternative is to manually ladle fly food into each vial, marked with a stripe indicating the required volume to make sure to add exactly 8 mL.\nOnce food has been dispensed, cover with cheesecloth or similar and leave to dry unplugged (without plugs) for at least 12 h.\nNote: A 10-point (plus vehicle control) titration curve with a single experimental strain (user’s choice), a negative control strain (EGFP control strain) (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]), and a positive control strain (marker expressing strain) requires a minimum of 132 fly food vials (44 per strain; 4 per drug concentration) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/976-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example survival curves determining effective selection or counterselection drug concentrations\n(A) Vial configuration to perform drug titration analysis testing a user specified strain against a negative control strain (EGFP) and a positive control strain (G418R). An 11-point (including vehicle control) titration curve with a single experimental strain (user’s choice), a negative control strain (EGFP control strain) (see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]), and a positive control strain (marker expressing strain) requires a minimum of 132 fly food vials (44 per strain, 4 per drug concentration).\n(B) Drug preparation workflow to perform drug titration analysis. Eleven mL of 50× master stock is made and diluted with MQ water over eleven 2 mL tubes, as indicated, resulting in the final concentrations and working dilutions, as indicated.",
    "(C) Example survival data showing a titration curve for the drug G418 sulfate. A G418 sulfate resistant strain (G418R) was compared to the EGFP control strain (Control). The concentration highlighted in green represents the effective selection concentration (ESC) at which only the resistant animals survive while all control animals are eliminated without significantly affecting G418 resistant strain survival versus vehicle control. Error bars represent S.E.M. for at least 3 biological replicates per condition per strain.\n(D) Survival data showing a titration curve for the counterselection agent ganciclovir. A sensitized strain (GCVS) was compared to the control strain (EGFP). The concentration highlighted in purple represents the effective counterselection concentration (ECC) at which only the control strain survives while all sensitized animals are eliminated without significantly affecting control strain survival versus vehicle control. Error bars represent S.E.M. for at least 3 biological replicates per condition per strain.\nNote: The EGFP control strain features the EGFP fluorescent marker expressed using the same expression cassette as the drug resistance/sensitivity markers. It was inserted into the same genomic location (VK00033) and in the same genetic background as the positive marker control strains to eliminate any position effect differences when comparing different marker strains (Matinyan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: The exact number required will depend on the user’s experimental design, though we recommend following our standard setup at least once before varying conditions. The example provided in this protocol uses 132 vials as described below. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDrugging prepared food\nTiming: 2 h active, 48 h total",
    "Note: While this protocol describes setting up a titration curve for G418 sulfate, it is applicable for any of the other selection (puromucin, blasticidin S, or hygromycin B) or counterselection (ganciclovir or 5-fluorocytosine) drugs previously described (Matinyan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), or any novel to-be-tested drug. The amount of each drug, solvent, and relevant positive control varies depending on drug. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for a full list of drugs, solvents, etc.\nMake a 50× solution of drug for the highest working concentration to be used (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: In this example the highest concentraton will be 25 mg/mL. Addition of 160 μL of drug to each 8 mL food vial represents a dilution factor of 50, hence the 50× master stock. We describe setting up a 10–point titration curve (and an 11th point for the vehicle control, MQ H2O) from 2.5 mg/mL to 25 mg/mL of G418 sulfate. The resulting concentrations in the food vials will range from 50 to 500 μg/mL with a 50 μg/mL step size.\nNote: When calculating the amount of drug needed it is important to consider the volume of drug required to adequately treat all vials. For one food vial, containing 8 mL of food, 160 μL of drug is needed. In this example, we will be making 12 vials per drug concentration (4 vials per concentration for each of 3 fly strains). The minimum volume required will be 1.92 mL of drug (160 μL multiplied by 12). However, it is recommended to always make slightly more drug than is minimally required because there will likely be some pipetting error. We will be making 2 mL of drug per dilution to ensure all vials receive the right amount of drug.",
    "Measure out 275 mg of G418 sulfate into the 15 mL conical using the analytic balance and microspatula.\nDissolve in 11 mL of MQ H2O by inverting conical 5–10 times resulting in a solution with concentration 25 mg/mL.\nNote: More rigorous mixing may be necessary depending on drug used requiring use of a vortexer. See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for solvent details.\nMake a dilution series by adding the appropriate amount of 50× stock solution to each of the nine 5 mL tubes.\nNote: We recommend making the stock solution fresh each time, but any remainder can be stored for up to 1–2 months at −20°C.\nAdd MQ H2O to dilute drug to appropriate concentration resulting in a dilution series each with a final volume of 2 mL.\nPoke several holes, 8–10, about 3/4th of the way into each of the 132 vials from the previous step.\nNote: Hole poking will allow added drug to percolate more fully and evenly into the food (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nAdd 160 μL of each drug concentration to hole punched vials using a standard pipette and tips or repeater (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: For each concentration, we make four biological replicates (four vials) per fly strain. This results in 44 vials per fly strain (including 4 vials treated with vehicle control) and 132 total vials for an experiment involving three strains (Positive control, negative control, experimental).\nLet drugged food stand unplugged, but covered with cheesecloth or similar, to avoid contamination, for 48 h allowing drug to fully soak into the hole-punched food.\nPlug vials.\nSetting up the flies\nTiming: 2–3 h\nCollect the appropriate number of flies for each strain and separate them by sex.",
    "Note: We recommend using flies no older than 3 weeks of age as fecundity begins to decrease in older flies and may increase variability between repeats.\nAnesthetize flies of each strain using blowgun and dump onto flypad with CO2 running.\nSeparate into male and female (females do not have to be virginal) using the brush under the dissecting scope.\nAdd separated flies to fresh vials containing regular food.\nNote: Avoid crowding flies. Limit number of flies per vial to ∼60 animals.\nRecommended: While flies are recovering from CO2, tip vial on its side to prevent animals from falling into food and becoming stuck.\nOnce flies have recovered, place into 25°C incubator for at least 1 h.\nNote: We recommend separating the flies the day before setting up the experiment, while the drugged food is still drying, and allowing them to recover at 25°C for at least 12 h for best results.\nAnesthetize separated flies of each sex for a given strain and place on flypad with CO2 running.\nNote: We suggest doing this one vial at a time per gender per strain to minimize the amount of time spent by the flies under CO2.\nTo each vial for a given strain, add three males and three females (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUse the brush to sweep flies about halfway into the sideways vial.\nPlug the vial and leave sideways while flies recover.\nRepeat for each vial per concentration for each strain.\nOnce flies have fully recovered from CO2 place the vials upright in an appropriately sized tray.\nRunning and analyzing the drug titration curve\nTiming: 3 weeks\nPlace drugged vials loaded with flies as described in the previous step into the incubator set to 25°C.\nAllow flies to mate/lay eggs for 1 week.",
    "Remove all surviving adult flies by inverting the vials and tapping adults into an ethanol trap.\nAllow eggs/larvae to develop for an additional 2 weeks in the incubator at 25°C.\nNote: Flies should begin eclosing at the start of the second week. Drug treatment slows development of larvae by approximately 1 week versus vehicle control. By the end of the 3rd week all surviving flies should have eclosed. Non-resistant animals treated with selection drug tend to die during 1st–2nd larval instars. Conversely, drug sensitized animals exposed to counterselection drugs die early in pupation.\nRemove vials from incubator.\nAnesthetize flies one vial at a time.\nDump flies onto flypad with CO2 flowing.\nCount the number of adult flies taking care to include any adults that may have eclosed but fallen into the food.\nNote: Although the sex of the surviving animals can be noted, we have not observed any sex bias drug resistance for any of the marker/drug combinations.\nAfter recording the count, dump flies into waste container, such as an ethanol trap.\nRepeat until all vials are counted. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNormalize survival data by averaging the four vehicle control replicates for a given strain and then dividing all fly counts for that strain by this number (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: We report survival data as normalized percent survival versus vehicle control. Data are presented as the average percent survival for a given drug concentration for each strain tested with error bars representing standard error of the mean. We provide example curves for determining either an effective selection concentration for G418 sulfate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) or an effective counterselection concentration for ganciclovir (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Note: We advise four biological replicates for each concentration per strain to ensure enough replicates per point for statistical analysis. Sometimes a cross fails due to infertility or other factors producing little to no progeny and is obviously different from the other three vials for that drug concentration. Four replicates ensures that, in most cases, there will still be at least three replicates per data point. Obvious outliers should be excluded from averages and future analysis. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: We use the statistical analysis and graphing software Prism 9 (Graphpad) to analyze and visualize our data. However, the user may use any similar software for their analysis."
