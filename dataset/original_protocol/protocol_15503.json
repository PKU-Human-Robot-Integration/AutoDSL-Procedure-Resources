    "1. Dissection of larvae\nNOTE: The dissecting solution hemolymph-like saline (HL3.1)18 and the fixing solution 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)19,20are used at room temperature because the microtubules depolymerize when the temperature is too low.\nPick out a wandering 3rd instar larva with long blunt forceps. Wash it with HL3.1 and place it on the dissection dish under the stereomicroscope.\n\tNOTE: Wandering 3rd instar larva is identified by branched anterior spiracle and crawls around the tube at approximately 96 h (25 °C)21.\nPosition the larva with the dorsal or ventral side up. Identify the dorsal side by the two long tracheas and the ventral by the abdominal denticle belts.\n\t\nDepending on the tissue to observe, opt for dorsal or ventral dissection. This will allow for a more precise and detailed view of the specific area of interest. For NMJ and muscle cell observation, cut open the larval dorsal and ventral regions, respectively.\nPin the mouth hooks and the tail. Adjust the pins to keep the larva in an extended state. Add a drop of HL3.1 to the larva to prevent it from drying.\n\tNOTE: Ca2+ -free HL 3.1 can be used to minimize contraction of the muscles during dissection.\nUse the dissecting scissors to make a small transverse cut close to the posterior end, but do not cut off the posterior end. Then cut along the ventral midline towards the anterior end.\nInsert four insect pins on the four corners of the larva. Readjust insect pins such that the larva is maximally stretched in all directions.\nUse the forceps to remove internal organs while not damaging the muscles.\n2. Fixation\nAdd 100 µL of PFA (4%) to immerse carcasses for 40 min while the carcasses are still pinned on the dissecting dish.",
    "CAUTION: Effective protection measures are taken to avoid direct contact with skin or inhalation, as PFA is a hazard.\nDismount the pins and transfer the sample to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Rinse off PFA with 1x phosphate buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (0.2% PBST) to fill 2 mL microcentrifuge tube for 10 min on the decoloring shaker at 15 rpm. Repeat the wash process 5x.\n3. Immunocytochemistry\nImmerse the carcasses in blocking agent (5% goat serum in 0.2% PBST) and block for 40 min at room temperature.\nRemove the blocking agent and replace it with 200 µL of the primary antibody (e.g., anti-α-tubulin, 1:1000; anti-Futsch, 1:50) diluted with 0.2% PBST at 4 °C overnight. Visualize muscle microtubules by immunostaining with monoclonal anti-α-tubulin. Anti-Futsch can indirectly reflect the microtubule morphology in NMJ.\nAfter incubation of the primary antibody, wash larvae with 0.2% PBST for 10 min. Repeat 5x.\nIncubate the larvae with 200 µL of secondary antibody (e.g., goat anti-Mouse-488, 1:1000) diluted with 0.2% PBST at room temperature for 1.5 h in the dark.\nNext, add a nuclear dye such as TO-PRO(R) 3 iodide (T3605) at a concentration of 1:1000 into the incubating tube for 30 min when staining the microtubules in the dark20,22.\nRinse off the secondary antibody and the nuclear dye with 0.2% PBST for 10 min. Repeat 5x in the dark.\n4. Mounting\nPlace the larval carcass in 0.2% PBST on a glass slide and adjust it under the stereomicroscope. Make sure the inner surface of the larval carcass is facing up and all larval carcasses are arranged as desired.\nAbsorb excess PBST solution with a wipe and gently add a drop of antifade mounting medium.\nPlace a coverslip on the slide to cover the dissected larvae slowly and gently to avoid bubbles.",
    "Apply fingernail polish around the coverslip. Place the slide in the dark space to reduce fluorescent attenuation.\n5. Image acquisition\nTo acquire the images, use a laser scanning confocal microscope, select the 60x oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.42) or similar, and adjust the laser power and wavelength based on the experiment.\nTo identify the NMJ, capture images in muscle 4 in segment A3 (as shown in the location in Figure 1F). Select a 488 nm laser to activate the α-tubulin or Futsch and 543 nm to activate the HRP imaging track. Adjust the parameters to a frame size of 800 pixels x 800 pixels, a digital zoom of 2.0, and an imaging interval of 0.8 µm in NMJs (Figure 2).\nTo identify the microtubules in muscle, capture images of muscle 2 in segment A3-A5 (as shown in the location in Figure 1G) as it has fewer tracheal branches. Choose a 488 nm laser for activating α-tubulin and a 635 nm laser for activating the T3605 imaging track. Adjust the parameters to a frame size of 1024 pixels x 1024 pixels, a digital zoom of 3.0, and an imaging interval of 0.4 µm in muscle cells (Figure 3).\nSubscription Required.
