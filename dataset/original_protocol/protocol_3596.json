    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis step-by-step protocol consists of the following sections: culturing organoids, re-plating organoids for analysis, cartridge hydration, set up of mitochondrial and glycolysis stress tests and normalization by DNA content (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). All steps have been optimized for examining bioenergetics in organoids derived from mouse intestine, human colon, and from colorectal tumors.\nCulturing organoids\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nOrganoid growth rates vary depending on the tissue of origin, differentiation rates, and genetic mutations. To achieve an accurate and reliable assay, the number of organoids per well needs to be comparable within and across conditions. To better control for differences in growth rates, we first expand our organoids in normal culture plates and re-plate the organoids in Seahorse Cell Culture microplates plates 24–72 h prior to analysis. This re-plating step is meant to better control for the differences in number and size of the organoids between the conditions to be compared on the day of the Seahorse analysis. Thus, this timing should be adjusted depending on the growth rate of the organoid type. For mouse small intestine-, human colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids, 36–48 h prior to analysis is an adequate re-plating time.\nWhen long treatments are needed, for instance for organoid differentiation protocols, the treatments can be started during normal culture and continued after re-plating into Seahorse microplates. Here, we introduce our culturing methods for organoids derived from mouse small intestine, human colon, and colorectal tumors.\nFor mouse intestinal organoids:\nDisrupt organoids by mechanical shearing and plate them in a 24-well plate.\nCollect organoids in 1 mL of ice cold DMEM F12 advanced medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, and 20 mM glutamax (+++ medium).\nNote: Collecting 100 μL of organoids in Matrigel at the density depicted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Ci is sufficient.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/521-Fig2.jpg",

The grade of mechanical shearing of the organoids should be monitored and visualized in between steps using a microscope.\nNote: To prevent organoids from sticking to the pipet tips, pre-wet the pipet tips by pipetting op and down with cold +++ medium before starting the mechanical shearing.\nAdd 5 mL of ice cold +++ medium to the organoids.\nCentrifuge at 140–220 × g at 4°C for 5 min (Thermo Scientific SL40R centrifuge with Thermo Scientific 75003607 rotor, 800–1,000 rpm).\nRe-suspend the pellet in 200–300 μL of Matrigel to reach the following density (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Cii)\n200 μL of organoids in Matrigel is sufficient for the later re-plating step in the Seahorse cell culture microplate.\nPlate organoids in a 24-well plate and culture for 36–48 h.\nPlate 50 μL Matrigel per well divided in 3–4 droplets.\nIncubate the plate upside down at 37°C for 30 min.\nAdd culture medium.\nCulture organoids for 36–48 h prior to re-plating them in a Seahorse Cell Culture microplate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Ciii).",
    "Note: The time of culturing before re-plating organoids in Seahorse microplate largely relies on the growth rate of the organoids. As an example of this, medium composition favoring organoid expansion by preventing differentiation, such as Wnt addition to mouse small intestinal organoids (Rodríguez-Colman et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), requires a shorter culture time from splitting to re-plating. In addition to that, the selection of the culture timing should be adjusted to properly address the research question.\nFor colorectal cancer or colon organoids:\nDisrupt organoids by trypsinization and plate in a 24-well plate.\nCollect organoids in 10 mL of ice cold +++ medium.\nNote: Collecting 50 μL of organoids in Matrigel in the following density (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Di) will be sufficient.\nCentrifuge at 140–220 × g at 4°C for 5 min (Thermo Scientific SL40R centrifuge with Thermo Scientific 75003607 rotor, 800–1,000 rpm).\nTrypsinize the organoids in 2 mL of trypsin or trypLE solution until organoids are disrupted (single cells or small clumps of cells depending on the organoid line).\nAdd 10 mL of ice cold +++ medium.\nCentrifuge at 220–320 × g at 4°C for 5 min (1,000–1,200 rpm).\nRemove supernatant and add 10 mL of ice cold +++ medium.\nCentrifuge at 220–320 × g at 4°C for 5 min (1,000–1,200 rpm).\nRe-suspend the pellet in 150–300 μL Matrigel to reach the following density (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Dii).\n200 μL of organoids in Matrigel is sufficient for the later re-plating step in the Seahorse cell culture microplate.\nPlate organoids in a 24-well plate\nPlate 50 μL Matrigel per well, divided in 3–4 droplets.\nIncubate the plate upside down at 37°C for 30 min.\nAdd culture medium.\nCulture organoids until the desired size prior to re-plating them in a Seahorse Cell Culture microplate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]Diii).

    "Plate organoids for analysis\nTiming: 1–3 days\nSeahorse analysis has to be performed by plating organoids in Seahorse XF24 V28 PS cell culture microplates (Agilent, #100882-004) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Below we describe step-by-step how to accurately re-plate organoids to guarantee reliable measurements.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/521-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Organoid plating in Seahorse cell culture microplate and preparation of sensor cartridge\n(A) Seahorse XF24 V28 PS cell culture microplate.\n(B and C) Plating organoids in a Seahorse cell culture microplate placed on top of a pre-warmed water-filled flask.\n(D) Seahorse Sensor Cartridge on top of a Hydro Booster (black arrow) and Utility plate (dashed arrow) with injection ports A–D and O2- and pH-sensitive probe tips (black circle).\nAt least 24 h before plating, incubate the Seahorse XF24 V28 PS cell culture microplate to be used and a flask filled with water (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) at 37°C. This step enhances the adhesion of the Matrigel drop to the bottom of the plate.\nCollect the previously cultured organoids in 1 mL of ice cold +++ medium.\nNote: It is important not to disrupt the integrity of the organoids while collecting. For mouse small intestinal organoids cultured for 36 h on medium supplemented with EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin, it is recommended to collect 4 wells of a 24-well plate (50 μL Matrigel each) to fill 20 wells of a Seahorse microplate. For colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids cultured for 7 days after trypsinization, it is recommended to collect 1 well of a 24-well plate to fill 20 wells of a Seahorse microplate.\nCentrifuge at 140–220 × g at 4°C for 5 min (800–1,000 rpm).\nNote: Depending on the organoid type, centrifugation can affect organoid integrity. Choose the gravitational force that efficiently pulls down the organoids, but does not cause organoid disruption.",
    "Re-suspend the organoid pellet in a volume of Matrigel that leads to the appropriate organoid density (steps b–d).\nIt is important to reduce the variability in organoid density across and within experiments.\nFor mouse small intestine- and colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids, 20–40 organoids per well should be plated to measure OCR and ECAR within the range of sensitivity of the method (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B). Organoid density can be further adjusted to the specific requirements of the organoid type, under the consideration that the obtained measurements are within the range of sensitivity of the method (see CRITICAL).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/521-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Intestine-derived organoids in a Seahorse cell culture microplate and DNA quantification\n(A and B) Organoids plated in a Seahorse cell culture plate. Organoid densities have been adjusted to fit the requirements of the organoid type. Mouse intestinal organoids undergo crypt formation-based morphological changes and are plated at a lower density than wild-type colon and colorectal tumor organoids. The depicted densities result in OCR and ECAR measurements within the sensitive range. (A) Mouse small intestinal shFoxo1/3 organoids treated with doxycycline or Mdivi-1 for 36 h. (B) Wild-type colon and colorectal tumor-derived organoids P9t, P16t, and P19bt. In (A) and (B), yellow crosses indicate control wells.\n(C) DNA quantification of mouse small intestine- and human colon- and colorectal tumor-derived organoids in (A) and (B).\nAs a guideline for mouse small intestinal organoids, collect 4 wells of a 24-plate, start by re-suspending the organoids in 100 μL of Matrigel and dilute further when necessary.\nAs a guideline for colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids, collect 1 well of a 24-plate, start by re-suspending the organoids in 150 μL of Matrigel and dilute further when necessary.",
    "Critical: Small volumes of Matrigel rapidly polymerize at room temperature. Prevent this by keeping the organoid-containing tubes on ice at all possible times. The density of organoids in Matrigel droplet needs attention: if the density of the organoids is too low or too high, the sensitivity of the method may limit the reliability of the measurements. ECAR can be reliably measured between 20 and 200 mpH/min. OCR can be reliably measured between 100 and 1,000 pmol O2/min (higher OCR measurements could be considered upon validation).\nPlate organoids in a Seahorse Cell Culture Microplate [Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]] [Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]].\nPlace the Seahorse microplate on top of the pre-warmed water-filled flask (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: Placing the microplate on top of a warm surface facilitates plating 3 μL Matrigel droplets in the middle of Seahorse Cell Culture as the warmer temperature enhances the stability of the droplet, as such, and accelerates its polymerization.\nPlate 3 μL of Matrigel (without organoids) in 4 control wells (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nNote: OCR and ECAR measurements are sensitive to the presence of Matrigel. Therefore, in control wells Matrigel should also be plated in the same volume.\nPlate droplets of 3 μL Matrigel with organoids in the other wells (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, and 4B).\nNote: For an accurate assessment of the bioenergetic parameters, we suggest to have four to five wells per condition.\nAfter plating, place the Seahorse microplate plate back in the incubator for 10–15 min at 37°C.\nCritical: Normal plating of organoids involves turning the plate upside down. Here that step should be avoided to prevent disruption of the Matrigel droplets. As small volumes of Matrigel polymerize fast, do not leave the plate for longer than the stated time to prevent drying out of the Matrigel droplet.\nAdd 200 μL of culture medium in each well.",
    "Critical: Due to the limited plating area, organoids should be plated in the middle of the well and in between the three nodes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Inaccurate plating leads to its adherence to the walls of the well and consequently to inaccurate measurements.\nWhen required add the treatment of interest to the selected wells.\nCulture organoids in the Seahorse microplate for 1–3 days until a mitochondrial or glycolysis stress test is performed.\nNote: As described in the “culturing organoids” section, this time frame is dependent on the growth rates of the organoids and the desired effect of the optional treatment.\nCartridge hydration\nTiming: 4–72 h\nEach probe tip of the sensor cartridge contains sensor material that detects changes in O2 concentration and pH (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). For correct functioning, the probe tips of the sensor cartridge have to be hydrated in XF Calibrant for a minimum of 4 h and a maximum of 72 h. For practical reasons we recommend to hydrate the cartridge for 12 to 24 h.\nLift the sensor cartridge from the Utility plate, and pipet 1 mL of XF Calibrant into each well of the Utility plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPlace the sensor cartridge back on the Utility plate with the Hydro Booster in between, in such a way that the probe tips of the Sensor Cartridge are submerged in XF Calibrant.\nPlace the Sensor Cartridge in a non-CO2 37°C humidified incubator for at least 4 h, but at maximum for 72 h.\nXF mitochondrial stress test or glycolysis stress test\nTiming: 3 h",
    "Agilent offers multiple assays to analyze different bioenergetic parameters. We have optimized the assay medium composition, the concentrations of substrates and inhibitors and the measurement settings for the XF Analyzer for performing mitochondrial and glycolysis stress tests in mouse small intestine, colon, and colorectal tumor-derived organoids.\nTake pictures of the organoids in all wells of the Seahorse microplate (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, and 4B) by a bright-field microscope.\nNote: Imaging the organoids helps to control for viability and to compare differences in organoid growth and morphology across conditions and among experiments.\nPrepare 50 mL assay medium.\nIn this protocol, we prepare assay medium with base medium with phenol red (Agilent, #102353-100) and buffer it to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Assay medium needs to be supplemented with different metabolic substrates as indicated in Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], and can be stored for 24 h at 4°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_521_2.csv\naDefault assay medium composition suggested by Agilent.\nbAssay medium composition optimized for mouse small intestine- and human colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_521_3.csv\naDefault assay medium composition suggested by Agilent.\nbAssay medium composition optimized for mouse small intestine- and human colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids.\nFor a mitochondrial stress test, prepare assay medium according to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nFor a glycolysis stress test, prepare assay medium according to Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\nNote: Following Agilent’s recommendations, substrates should be provided in saturating concentrations to ensure that they will not be limiting OCR and ECAR measurements. In Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] we have listed the saturating substrate concentrations adjusted for both, mouse small intestine- and human colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoid analysis. Note that these concentrations are organoid type-specific and need to be determined empirically when applied to other organoid types.\nPrepare organoids for the XF analysis.\nRemove the culture medium from the organoids.",
    "Carefully wash organoids twice with 500 μL assay medium.\nAdd 525 μL assay medium into each well.\nIncubate organoids in an incubator without CO2 control at 37°C for at least 30 min, but at maximum 1 h.\nOptional: When analyzing the effect of drugs/treatment on bioenergetics, it could be necessary to maintain the treatment during the assay. This needs to be decided depending on the mechanism of action of the drug and the research question. Note that the assay medium is not buffered. Therefore, depending on the compound type, it can be required to readjust the pH of the compound’s stock.\nDuring the incubation time of organoids in assay medium, prepare the injection solutions. Injections should be prepared in assay medium and 75 μL of these injections should be pipetted in the injection ports (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). The device will inject the drugs in the order of port A to port D.\nFor a standard mitochondrial stress test, prepare Oligomycin, FCCP and Rotenone & Antimycin A and inject 75 μL of each in port A, B, and C, respectively (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] and Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_521_4.csv\nFor a standard glycolysis stress test, prepare glucose, Oligomycin and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and inject 75 μL of each in port A, B, and C, respectively (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5] and Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_521_5.csv\na2-Deoxyglucose solutions are not stable over time and should be dissolved on the day of performing the glycolysis stress test\nUpon completion of preparation of the injection ports, place the sensor cartridge hold in the Utility plate back into the incubator.",
    "Note: When other organoid types are used, optimal substrate and inhibitor concentrations have to be determined. We recommend to start with titrating Oligomycin, followed by respectively FCCP and Rotenone and Antimycin A. The lowest concentration that causes maximal inhibition of every drug should be selected. For an indication of inhibitor concentrations used for cell lines, check the Seahorse XF Analyzer guides: https://www.agilent.com/en/support/cell-analysis/seahorse-assay-guides-templates[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/support/cell-analysis/seahorse-assay-guides-templates]\nOptional: For analysis of the immediate metabolic response to a certain drug, drugs can be injected during the mitochondrial or glycolysis stress test via the injection ports (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C). For such a bioenergetics assay, use injection port A for the drug of interest and move the injections corresponding to the mitochondrial or glycolysis stress test to port B, C and D respectively (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). An example of such an application in a mitochondrial stress test, can be found in our recent study (Ludikhuize et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Note that the concentrations of the inhibitors in injection ports need to be adjusted according to the change in the volume resulting from adding preceding injection step in A. Based on the research question, the order of the substrates and inhibitors can also be re-arranged. Then, the experimental settings can be updated in the Wave software accordingly.\nPrepare settings of the XF Analyzer.\nOpen the Wave software.\nOpen a mitochondrial or glycolysis stress test template, and fill in the assay details. A detailed explanation on how to create and customize assay template files using the Wave software can be found in section 2.4 in: https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay].\nMake sure you adjust the XF analysis settings in the “Instrument Protocol” section.\nFor optimized mitochondrial stress test settings for mouse small intestine- and colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids, see Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_521_6.csv\naSuggested by Agilent.",
    "bThese settings can be applied to mouse small intestine- and human colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids.\nFor optimized glycolysis stress test settings for mouse small intestine- and colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids, see Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_521_7.csv\naSuggested by Agilent.\nbThese settings can be applied to mouse small intestine- and human colon- or colorectal tumor-derived organoids.\nSave your template.\nCritical: compared to cell lines, organoids show a slower response to Oligomycin, possibly due to the presence of Matrigel. Therefore, we adjusted the settings by applying a 10-min waiting step right after the injection of the inhibitor in both, the mitochondrial stress test and the glycolysis stress test (Tables 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]).\nRun the mitochondrial or glycolysis stress test [Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]].\nUpon clicking on “Run,” the Wave software will ask to insert the sensor cartridge in the XF Analyzer.\nRemove the Hydro Booster and the lid (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D), and place the sensor cartridge hold in the Utility plate in the XF Analyzer.\nAfter the calibration step which takes approximately 15 min, the Wave software will request to replace the Utility plate by the Seahorse Cell Culture microplate containing the organoids.\nThe XF analysis will automatically begin.\nNote: Once the experiment has finished, the OCR and ECAR measurements will be displayed on the XF Analyzer screen. A first inspection of the results can be done at this point. When high standard deviations within one condition are observed, switching from “group” view to “well” view, allows to detect possible outliers (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), which can result, for instance, from inaccurate plating or differential organoid viability. Pictures taken at step 15 can be used to judge the cause of large standard deviations. Excluding outliers from the analysis can be considered (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5C) [Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/521-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Detection of possible outliers in Seahorse XF Wave software",

In (A), the measurements are displayed as “group view” and in (B) as “well view.” In (B), the line in bold indicates the outlier measurement. (C) “Group view” of the OCR measurements displayed in (A) upon exclusion of the outlier depicted in (B).\nAfter the experiment, carefully remove medium from the wells.\nCritical: The plate should be removed immediately after the experiment has finished in order to prevent loosing organoid viability as a result of the presence of the inhibitors used in the assay.\nPause Point: When required, after medium aspiration, the Seahorse Cell Culture Microplate can be stored at −20°C for at least 2 weeks to later proceed with the DNA quantification step.\nDNA quantification\nTiming: 2–3 h\nCalculation of bioenergetic parameters requires normalization to correct for differences in numbers of cells, organoids, or amount of biological material. Standard normalization methods are based on the determination of cell numbers or protein content. Due to the presence of Matrigel, normalization by protein content is not adequate when using organoids. Quantification of cell numbers in organoids is technically challenging due to their 3D structure and the limited number of cells. A reliable alternative for normalization of OCR and ECAR measurements from organoids is normalization by the DNA content. Below we describe how to collect and isolate DNA from organoids cultured on Seahorse Cell Culture microplates.\nAdd 100 μL ice cold Cell Recovery Solution (Corning, #354253) to each well of the Seahorse Cell Culture microplate.\nNote: Upon decision to remove a certain outlier from analysis in step 20, the organoids from this well should not be collected for DNA quantification.\nIncubate the plate at 4°C for 30–60 min.\nNote: Incubation in Cell Recovery Solution facilitates organoid collection and removal of the Matrigel.",
    "Collect the organoids and pool the organoids belonging to one condition in an Eppendorf tube.\nCentrifuge at 10,620 × g at 4°C for 5 min (Eppendorf 5417R centrifuge with an Eppendorf F45-30-11 rotor, 10 000 rpm).\nRemove supernatant while leaving the pellet undisrupted.\nIsolate genomic DNA by using the QIAamp DNA micro kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nIn order to maximize the DNA yield, add 30 μL elution buffer let it stand for 2–3 min to maximize DNA elution.\nMeasure genomic DNA by Nanodrop.\nCritical: Aiming for similar organoid densities across conditions improves the robustness of the analysis. To be noticed, normalization by pooled DNA corrects for variability across conditions but does not correct for differences within conditions. Therefore, the variation in organoid density within conditions should be kept low.\nNote: In these protocols, we apply DNA normalization; this does not exclude the application of other normalization methods. Importantly, RNA quantification could be considered when differences in DNA amount are expected across compared conditions. Importantly, some organoid types could have a high rate of shedding dead cells. This requires attention, as damaged cells can be metabolically low/inactive but they still contribute to total DNA quantification."
