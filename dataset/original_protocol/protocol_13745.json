    "All animal care was in accordance with the guidelines of Boston Children's Hospital and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols. The mice used in this study are wild type C57/B6 mice and Cdh5-CreERT2 x Ai14 tdTomato crossed mice.\n1. Preparation of solutions\nPrepare phosphate buffer solution (1x PBS) and 2% agarose solution required during the experiment in advance.\n\t\nMix 2 g agarose powder into 100 mL of autoclaved water. Heat it in the microwave a few seconds at a time until the solution is clear.\nPlace the solution in a water bath at 42 °C until use.\n\t\t​NOTE: Both PBS and 2% agarose can be stored at room temperature for weeks.\n2. Extraction of the mouse lung\nEuthanize the mouse by isoflurane overdose. Achieve isoflurane overdose by placing a small amount of isoflurane on tissue paper in the lower level and placing the mouse in the upper level in a desiccator. The mouse remains in the desiccator until unconscious.\nEnsure death of the mouse by applying inferior pressure on the neck and pulling caudal on the tail. Bring the mouse to the dissecting surface.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position and secure it into place taping paws and nose to table with adhesive tape.\nSpray the ventral surface of the mouse with 70% ethanol and wipe off the excess ethanol.\nLift the abdominal skin of the mouse with forceps at the location of the bladder and cut at the midline with surgical scissors, moving superiorly to the cervical region, exposing the trachea.\nLift the underlying fascial layer with tweezers and cut with surgical scissors to expose visceral organs and mediastinal compartment, again cutting inferiorly to superior.\nCut the sternum at the midline to expose the heart and the lung.",
    "Using blunt dissection, detach the diaphragm from the liver and abdominal compartment.\nLocate the inferior vena cava (IVC) under the intestines and cut the IVC.\nLocate the right ventricle.\n\tNOTE: The right ventricle will have a lighter appearance compared to the left ventricle and the intraventricular septum should be visualized, separating the right ventricle from the left ventricle.\nInject 0.5 mL of 1% fractionated heparin to the right ventricle with a 25-30 G butterfly needle and then flush slowly but steadily with 10-15 mL of 1x PBS (Figure 1A).\n\t\nUse caution not to insert the needle through the heart and inject heparin into the mediastinal cavity.\n\t\tNOTE: The injection of 1x PBS turns the lung tissue white. The fluid extravasating from the abdominal aorta should be clear and colorless and the liver may become white in appearance after successful flushing.\nLocate the larynx and dissect the surrounding fascia and tissue using blunt tip tweezers.\nPlace the surgical suture under the trachea and loosely tie a surgical knot.\nPlace a small hole in the trachea superior to string and canulate with 20 G blunt-ended needle.\nTighten the suture around the needle and trachea using a surgical knot.\nInject 2.5-4 mL of agarose into the trachea and monitor for inflation of the lung.\nAfter agarose is instilled, pour cold, chilled 1x PBS over the lung to solidify agarose.\nCut the trachea superior to surgical suture and dissect the lung and heart from the mediastinum by removing any adhesions and fascia.\nAfter solidification, place in 1x DMEM (enough to submerge tissue) in a Petri dish to keep on ice. Immediately slice one lobe using a vibratome machine (Figure 1B).\n3. Precision cut lung slices\nAttach the sample to the platform with superglue, keeping the medial side of the sample facing up.",
    "Fill the sample container with 1x PBS, ensuring that the sample is completely submerged.\nFill the container surrounding the sample container with ice to keep surrounding PBS and sample cold.\nTurn on the vibratome and adjust to the desired settings below.\n\t\nSet the thickness to 300um.\nSet the frequency to 100 Hz.\nSet the amplitude to 0.6 mm.\nSet the speed to 5 µm/s.\nUsing an Allen wrench, turn the blade holder into the safe position and open the jaws to insert a blade.\nTighten the jaws with an Allen wrench and turn the blade holder into the appropriate position for slicing.\nPlace the sample and the platform onto the box and slide in front of the blade.\nFill the box around the sample platform with 1x PBS until the sample is submerged.\nBring the vibratome blade up to the edge of the block and manually lower the blade until it is even with the top of the sample.\nConfirm the appropriate settings and run the vibratome (Figure 2).\nAs fresh slices are cut, remove the samples from the PBS and place them into a sterile Petri dish with 10 mL of 1x DMEM containing 1x antibiotic-antimycotic.\nWhen finished, retract the blade entirely and then use the Allen wrench to raise the blade into a safe position.\nStore the samples in 1x DMEM in an incubator at 37 °C with viability preserved for up to 10 days (see viability experiment below).\n4. Example vasoconstrictor experiment\nPlace a vibratome slice on a microscope slide.\nBefore placing it on the slide, use a cleaning wipe to get rid of the excess medium (PBS).\nPlace the sample under phase-contrast microscopy and use 10-20x magnification to identify a vessel.",
    "Put 500 µL of vasoconstrictors, such as 60 mM KCl or 1 µM Endothelin-1 to completely submerge the slide.\nObserve and capture the video by recording for 30 s-60 s (Video 1).\n5. Preparing the tissue for RNA or protein lysis on PCLS\nBefore beginning the experiment, fill a small polystyrene foam box with 1 L of liquid nitrogen.\nPlace two small microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 mL) in the container with liquid nitrogen before starting.\n\tNOTE: Liquid nitrogen should cool outside of the tubes, however, not be inside. Be sure to handle liquid nitrogen with care and do not expose the skin to liquid nitrogen. Use forceps and gloves to place and remove tubes from the box.\nPlace 4-5 fresh vibratome slices in a mortar bowl.\nPour 5-10 mL of liquid N2 on top of the slices in the mortar bowl.\nQuickly use the pestle to grind the flash freeze slices into powder before liquid nitrogen evaporates.\n\tNOTE: Tissue should condense into a fine powder. If not, add additional liquid nitrogen until achieved.\nUsing a steel laboratory scooper (prechilled with liquid nitrogen), scoop the powder into the two chilled microcentrifuge tubes.\nLyse the powder by adding 500 µL of RNA extraction reagent to proceed with RNA isolation or 500 µL of RIPA buffer (contains 1x protease inhibitors) to proceed with protein lysis.\nStore the samples at -80 °C until additional RNA isolation, BCA measurement, and western blot.\n6. Determining viability\nAfter vibratome preparation, place two lung slices into a 24-well culture plate with 450 µL of DMEM media and 50 µL of cell viability reagent (ensure that the tissue is submerged entirely).\nPlace the samples back into 5% CO2 at 37 °C incubator overnight with minimal exposure to light.",
    "In the morning, observe the solution for color change. The blue solution turns pink when the tissue is viable.\n7. Preservation of cell labeling\nTreat a transgenic Cdh5-CreERT2 crossed with Ai14 tdTomato mouse with an IP injection of Tamoxifen (2 mg/day) for a total of 5 days (total dose 10 mg Tamoxifen) to induce tdTomato label Cre positive cells.\nOne week after injection, prepare the lungs using the above steps 1 to 3.\nAfter preparation of the precision-cut lung slice, place the tissue onto a microscope slide and place a coverslip on top of the tissue.\nUse a confocal microscope to detect tdTomato staining (using excitation wavelength 555 nm).\nSubscription Required.
