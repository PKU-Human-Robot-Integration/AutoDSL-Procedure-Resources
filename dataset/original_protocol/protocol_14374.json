    "The human cadaver used in this work was provided under the framework of body donations for medical education. Informed consent for body donation was obtained in writing during the lifetime of the donor. In accordance with the federal and cantonal laws, no review by an ethics committee was necessary.\nNote: This protocol assumes that the persons performing the practice surgery are neurosurgeons with training and expertise in standard neurosurgical procedures, including patient positioning and head fixation, craniotomy and durotomy, and suturing. In addition to the tools and equipment specific to the microelectrode array, standard neurosurgical tools and equipment are used.\n1. Selection of the cadaver and setup of the operating room\nSelect a specimen with no history of disease or injury to the head, skull and brain.\n\t\nOptionally, perform a computed tomography (CT) scan of the cadaver's head to ensure that there is no significant intracranial lesion (Figure 1A), e.g. chronic subdural hematoma or an intra-axial expansive lesion. Using the CT scan, identify a target cortical area for the implantation of the microelectrode array (such as the \"hand knob\" area of the precentral gyrus, corresponding to the representation of the hand in the primary motor cortex27, in the case of training for the implantation of a BCI).\nPosition cadaver in lateral decubitus on an operating table. Use an operating table rather than a dissection table in order to add to the realism of the OR-like environment and facilitates the fixation of the skull clamp and pneumatic impactor. Position the cadaver in lateral decubitus in order to allow the fronto-temporal approach in a formaldehyde-fixed cadaver, in whom neck rotation is limited.\nFix the head in the skull clamp (Figure 1B). Cover with surgical drapes (Figure 1C).",
    "Note: In our case, the posterior pins of skull clamp are unusually positioned in the sagittal plane of the head (see Figure 1B), because we used a skull clamp that had been modified for surgical training purposes to hold a cadaveric head separated from the rest of the body.\n\t\nWhen using a standard skull clamp on an operating table, place the posterior pins securing the head perpendicular to the sagittal plane.\n2. Exposure of the neocortical surface\nIncise the scalp using a scalpel, following a question-mark incision to expose the temporal and frontal bones. Dissect the temporalis muscle along the posterior edge of the incision. Recline the scalp and temporalis muscle by blunt dissection (Figure 1D).\nPerform a large square fronto-temporal craniotomy, e.g. 5 x 5 cm (Figure 2A). For that purpose, drill four burr holes at the corners of the intended craniotomy. Then, use the craniotome to connect the burr holes. Remove the bone flap using a spatula, exposing the dura mater. Store the bone flap in saline solution.\nOpen the dura mater on three sides of the craniotomy using dura scissors (Figure 2B). Recline it and expose the arachnoid membrane and the surface of the cerebral neocortex (Figure 2C).\n3. Fixation of the electrode pedestal\nSelect a cortical gyrus where the microelectrode array will be implanted. Select a gyral surface that is approximately flat so that the microelectrode array will lie flush with it when inserted. Ensure that there is no visible blood vessel coursing on the cortical surface where the microelectrode array will be inserted.",
    "Select a site for the fixation of the electrode pedestal on the superior edge of the craniotomy, close to the skin incision, and allowing sufficient slack for the wire bundle so that the microelectrode array can reach the target gyrus. Screw the pedestal onto the external table of the skull bone next to the craniotomy (Figure 2D). Use 6 to 8 self-tapping cortical bone screws (6 mm length, 2 mm diameter) to ensure appropriate fixation.\n\t\nWhen manipulating the pedestal, always ensure that the microelectrode array does not touch anything (it may be damaged or could lacerate the neocortical surface) by holding the wire bundle close to the microelectrode array with tweezers with plastic- or rubber-coated tips (Figure 2E).\n4. Positioning and insertion of the microelectrode array\nPosition the microelectrode array parallel with the surface of the target gyrus. Bend the wire bundle as necessary for that purpose (Figure 3A).\n\tNote: The stiff wire bundle does not easily conform to the surgeon's wishes. Care and patience are required to obtain good alignment of the microelectrode array and cortical surface.\n\t\nOptionally, use \"dog-bone\" titanium straps to secure the wire bundle to the skull and control its course toward the target gyrus. Do not screw the strap too tightly to avoid damaging the wire bundle.\nBring the pneumatic impactor into approximate alignment with the back of the microelectrode array (Figure 3B). Control the connections of the pneumatic impactor to its control box, and then turn on the control box.\n\tNote: Make sure that the pneumatic impactor is at least 5 mm away from the array before turning the control box on, as the pneumatic impactor might be triggered when first turned on.",
    "Use the millimetric screws of the pneumatic impactor holder to refine the impactor's alignment with the back of the microelectrode array (Figure 3B, inset). Using the impactor, apply an excursion distance- and pressure-controlled tap to the back of the microelectrode array and insert it into the cortical surface, pushing it through the arachnoid membrane.\n\tNote: Check that the microelectrode array is flush with the cortical surface.\n5. Positioning of the subdural ECOG grid\nNote: This step is optional.\nPosition a subdural ECOG grid over the exposed cortical surface (Figure 3D). If necessary, remove electrodes by cutting through the grid so that the overall shape of the ECOG grid fits the craniotomy.\nOrient the ECOG grid so that its wires will exit the dura mater and skull superiorly or posteriorly.\nIrrigate the ECOG grid with saline before placing it into contact with the cortical surface.\nSecure the ECOG grid by suturing it to the dura mater at the edges of the durotomy.\n6. Repositioning and closure of the dura mater, bone flap, and skin flap\nReflect the dura mater back over the exposed cortical surface and suture it to the edges of the durotomy.\nScrew \"dog-bone\" titanium straps onto the edges of the bone flap using self-tapping cortical bone screws. Reposition the bone flap within the craniotomy. Secure the bone flap to neighboring skull bones with the \"dog-bone\" titanium straps and self-tapping cortical bone screws. Take care not to crush the wire bundle of the microelectrode array (and those of the optional ECOG grid) between bone edges.\nReflect and suture the skin flap. Close the skin incision around the neck of the electrode pedestal (Figure 3E).\n\t\nAlternatively, allow the pedestal to egress the scalp through a separate stab incision made into the scalp flap.",
