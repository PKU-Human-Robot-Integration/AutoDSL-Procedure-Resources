    "This randomized controlled trial protocol was approved by the Comité d’éthique et de la recherche en santé de L’humain at the Centre hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke and the Comité d’éthique et de la recherche at the Centre intégré de santé et services sociaux de la Capitale Nationale in Québec City, Canada.\n1. Identification of Collaborators and the Preparation of Recruitment\nNetwork with LCs and/or a local mother-to-mother support groups where frequent lactation consultations are provided in order to identify where the study will take place.\nOrganize a training session (roughly 2 h) for potential recruiters (LCs from the group identified at step 1.1, external LCs, midwives, and perinatal nurses) on biomechanical suckling difficulties based on Genna’s description of the innate sequence of suckling behavior8, and the eligibility criteria for this study. Include a brief description of potential osteopathic techniques used in this context.\nEnsure that the LCs identified at step 1.1 are familiar with the tools used in the study and, if necessary, are trained to use the LATCH Assessment Tool, the VAS, and the questionnaires.\n\t\nTest-run the protocol procedures, such as welcoming the mother-infant dyads, explaining and facilitating the signing of the consent form, and completing the assessment using the tools.\nValidate the reliability of the osteopathic palpation with other osteopaths experienced in pediatric osteopathy. Train the study osteopath to be able to evaluate and perform the osteopathic treatment needed within 30 min maximum, in order to minimize inconsistencies arising from the infants’ behavior, such as sleep stages and suckling skills and stamina.\n2. Selection of Implementation Sites",
    "Select a site with at least two hospitable rooms with conveniences for families to host the study. Consider providing drinking water, a comfortable place to breastfeed, and diaper changing facilities. Also, provide pillows or cushions to support the mothers’ arms, a footboard for better positioning, and chairs for family members accompanying the mother-infant dyad and the LC (when performing the evaluation).\n\tNOTE: The rooms must be easy to access with a stroller and for mothers with limitations following a C-section delivery. A sofa is optimal, but a rocking chair for the mother plus a small bench for the osteopath is another option.\n3. Recruitment and Enrollment of Mother-infant Dyads\nIdentify eligible infants with biomechanical suckling dysfunctions through referrals from LCs, nurses in perinatal care, and midwives, after their first lactation consultation. Refer them to the study.\n\t\nSelect infants less than six weeks of age, with biomechanical suckling dysfunctions (suboptimal head extension, restricted head rotation, restricted mouth opening, jaw stiffness, habit of biting the nipple, restricted tongue mobility).\nExclude infants with a cleft palate, cleft lip, surgical tongue-tie, or other medical conditions; twins; and infants with prior treatment using any type of manual therapy.\nOn the first appointment following the referral, welcome mother and infant and explain the full study process. Obtain informed consent.\nOnce screened, clearly establish how parents will contact the clinic, to ensure a rapid turn-around for the intervention and to schedule an appointment.\n\tNOTE: The LC provides an initial lactation consultation prior to the preintervention assessment and, then, determines the LATCH scores and the VAS pre- and postosteopathic intervention.\n4. Assessment of Baseline Study Outcomes\nAsk the mother to give one breast. Observe the infant’s suckling rhythm.",
    "Assess the infant’s baseline ability to latch, using the LATCH Assessment Tool, right at the beginning of the feed. Be aware that, sometimes, infants are in a deep sleep and it may take a long time to awaken them. Be prepared to complete the administrative process quickly if the infant is hungry and upset prior to the feed.\nRequest the mother to complete a VAS at the beginning of the feed.\nAdminister a baseline questionnaire for sociodemographic data, breastfeeding data (e.g., number of feeds per day, number of bottle feeds versus breastfeeds, number of diapers changed in the last 24 h), and maternal perceptions of biomechanical difficulties (e.g., infant bites the nipple during the feed, opens his mouth widely to latch, or slips on the nipple while feeding).\nAsk the mother to remove the infant from the breast when the suckling movement is slowing.\n\tNOTE: When the assessment is completed, the LC leaves the room.\n5. Performance of an Osteopathic Assessment\nOpen the sealed and opaque envelope with the corresponding study number for the mother-infant dyad, which will assign the dyad to the control or treatment group.\nAsk the mother to sit on a couch with a cushion on her knees and the infant lying back on it. Sit by her side. Connect with the infant by making eye contact. Talk to the infant before putting hands on its body.\nBegin with a general observation of the infant’s posture, tone, and any asymmetries.\nAssess the infant’s head passive rotation left and right with the goniometer. Respect any discomfort manifestation or limitation (for example, ipsilateral shoulder elevation).\nObserve the infant’s body attitude and assess any osteopathic lesions for each part of the body regardless of the allocation group, using the standardized grid described in Table 1.",
    "Begin the treatment with the pelvic area since it is an important sphere of compression during the birth process16,35. Assess the tissue texture and tone in the lower limbs’ fascia, sacroiliac joints, sacrum, and hips, as well as the range of motion of the pelvic sphere versus the lumbar spine.\nMove hands from the infant’s pelvis to its skull and similarly assess tissue texture and tone and, as appropriate, the range of motion of the abdominal cavity, spine, diaphragm, thorax, and cervical spine. Pay careful attention to the first cervical vertebrae, and assess the anterior structures of the neck, the hyoid bone, and sublingual muscles.\nBe very precise and gentle as to the placement of fingers at the skull base, as structures are tiny and delicate.\nMove forward from the base of the skull to the occipital bone, temporal bones, parietal bones, sphenoid bone, frontal bone, and features of the face, including the jaw. Infants yawn frequently; observe the jaw movements and the symmetry of the face.\nFor each structure, record observations of the texture, tone, quality and range of motion, and straining on the standardized grid (Table 1).\n6. Performance of Osteopathic/Sham Intervention\nNOTE: The osteopathic techniques described in this protocol are key osteopathic approaches available for infants with biomechanical suckling difficulties. They focus on improving the infant’s ability to latch, improving pelvic mobility, improving head rotation and extension, improving mouth opening, and freeing the XII cranial nerve, which is responsible for the tongue motion.\nLie the infant down on his/her back on a pillow on his/her mother’s knees. Sit alongside the mother on the couch, at the infant’s head.\nPerform the osteopathic treatment.\n\t\nStart the osteopathic treatment by addressing areas previously identified as dysfunctional.",
    "Begin by treating the pelvic area. Place the hands on each side of the infant’s pelvis, covering the iliac bones. Ensure that thumbs are on the anterior part of the iliac bones and fingertips are at the sacroiliac joint on each side. Using indirect technique, place the restricted structure in a comfortable position. Use continuous feedback until the complete loosening of the structure is achieved (known as a release)17,36.\nPlace fingers of both hands around the occipital bone, tips of the ring fingers contacting the condyles area, index fingers contacting the mastoid area and middle fingers between the occipital bone and the first cervical vertebra, as described for the condylar decompression technique37. Gently separate the fingers in the various spatial plans until the tissues soften and the condyles move freely.\n\t\tNOTE: At the upper cervical spine, spots are very close together and fragile.\nPlace one hand under the occipital bone and the other on the frontal and sphenoidal bones, avoiding eyes, in a fronto-occipital hold17. Place the occiput and sphenoid in their position of least resistance. Monitor the decrease in resistance and readjust the positioning of the structures until the release occurs.\nPlace one hand cupping under the occipital bone and the first three cervical vertebrae and the index finger and thumb of the other hand on each side of the hyoid bone. Wait until a release of the hyoid bone is felt through the structures in the other hand. Monitor and reassess, as done in a myofascial release technique36.\nEnd the osteopathic treatment by a global body harmonization. Put one hand on the pelvic area and the other on the skull. Gently balance the body volumes, addressing fascia, muscles, bones, and fluid, at least until a coherent and global release is perceived.\nPerform a sham intervention.",
    "Place hands on areas far from those with detected dysfunctions, without any intention of treatment.\nAnswer questions from the parents about osteopathy and the infant’s psychomotor development.\nPostpone the infant feed until the end of the intervention. Use a pacifier or the mother’s finger if necessary to soothe the infant.\nAssess the infant’s left and right passive head rotation with the goniometer.\nMake sure the evaluation and sham manipulation or the evaluation and osteopathic treatment have the same 30 min duration in order to keep the parents and the LCs blind as to treatment allocation.\nLeave the room. Fill in the standardized assessment grid (Table 1). Record details of the treatment performed.\n7. Reassessment of the Mother-infant Dyad\nNOTE: The LC re-enters the treatment room.\nTake time to set up the mother and the infant comfortably, to ensure the best conditions to take the breast again. Reassess the infant’s ability to latch with the LATCH Assessment Tool.\nAsk the mother to complete a second VAS.\nPerform a usual lactation consultation.\nSchedule a second appointment 48 h later. Inform the mother that there will be another breastfeeding evaluation, meaning that she will have to manage to feed her infant during this meeting.\n8. Final Face-to-face Assessment\nNOTE: For this assessment, parents will only meet an LC.\nSet up the mother and infant comfortably to create the best conditions to breastfeed. When the infant is ready (it may take some time), assess the ability to latch with the LATCH Assessment Tool.\nAsk the mother to complete a second VAS at the beginning of the feeding.\nAdminister a second questionnaire for breastfeeding follow-up, maternal perceptions of the infant’s ability to latch, and perception of their allocated group.\nPerform a second lactation consultation.\nOffer osteopathic treatment for infants in the control group.",
    "Make a phone appointment one week following this second visit.\n9. Assessment of the mother-infant dyad 10 days post enrolment\nCall the mother to complete the 10-day questionnaire, including breastfeeding follow-up and potential side effects. Remind the mother to complete the postal questionnaire, which includes a VAS and satisfaction component regarding their participation in the protocol.\nWait to receive the postal questionnaire. Call back 1x if necessary.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
