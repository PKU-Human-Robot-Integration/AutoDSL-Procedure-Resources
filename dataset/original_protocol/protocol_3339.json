    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\niPSC to NPC induction\nTiming: 7 days\nThe first step is to have optimal iPSCs in cell culture before the induction of the neural precursor cells (NPCs) from iPSCs begins. We have adopted an established protocol3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] to induce iPSCs into NPCs. The iPSCs to NPCs induction takes 7 days.\nCritical: iPSCs are from a frozen stock and need to be passaged at least once before the induction is initiated (around 2 weeks for iPSC thawing and maintenance).\nThaw iPSCs from a frozen stock.\nThaw the vitronectin aliquot at 20–25°C and prepare for each well of a 6 well vessel (10 cm2) 40 μL of vitronectin diluted in 1 mL of Cell Adhere dilution buffer.\nCoat culture vessels with vitronectin and incubate at 20–25oC for 1 h.\nNote: The temperature range 20–25°C corresponds to the room temperature (or RT) conditions.\nCritical: It is essential to use non-tissue culture treated culture plate for vitronectin coating.\nAlternative: Matrigel can be used as an alternative to vitronectin. See point 3.a for Matrigel coating instructions.\nPrepare complete StemFlex media with the Rock Inhibitor Y27632 (5 μL of 10 mM Y27632 stock in 10 mL for a final concentration of 5 μM).\nCritical: The ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) is only added for the first 24 hours of culture (5 μL in 10 mL) to promote cell survival.\nIncubate the frozen stock of iPSCs in a 37°C water bath until the ice in the tube disappears.\nTransfer the thawed iPSCs in an empty 10-mL Falcon tube and then add 4 mL of StemFlex media to the iPSCs drop-wise while shaking the tube to avoid an osmolarity shock and to obtain the iPSC suspension.",
    "When ready, aspirate the vitronectin from each well of the 6 well plate and replace with fresh StemFlex media, 2 mL per well.\nAdd 100 μL of iPSCs suspension to one coated well as a starting point.\nCheck the cell density and add more iPSC suspension if needed to achieve an optimal cell density (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3106-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. iPSC density\n(A and B) Optimal iPSC seeding densities and confluency. Since iPSCs grow in colonies instead of single cells, it is difficult to calculate the seeding density of iPSCs using number of cells per cm2. Here, two illustrations were drawn, looking down a brightfield microscope with a 4X objective, for references of: (A) optimal seeding density of iPSCs, showing floating aggregates of cell clusters each consisting of 5‒6 cells, and (B) optimal confluency of iPSCs colonies ready for passaging. Colonies should not merge with each other and have defined edges.\n(C and D) Morphology of iPSC colonies before NPC induction. Morphology of different iPSC colonies before NPC induction. Phase contrast images were taken using a FLoid imaging station. (C) A good iPSC colony with defined edges and a compact center. (C) A pre-differentiated iPSC colony with loose edges and differentiated cells, which should not be used for the NPC induction.",
    "(E) Cell confluency affects NPCs induction. In this example, 75, 100 or 150 μL of the iPSC stock were seeded at the beginning of the induction which results at different cell density in each well. Medium is turning yellow in the well labeled “150” after 24 h of media change which indicates that the cell confluency is too high and therefore there is a risk that small molecules might be insufficient for the induction of all iPSCs inside the well. We recommend that the medium is closely monitored for color changes during NPC induction. Do not use cells from wells which have a decoloration of the medium for the NPC bank.\nMaintain the iPSC culture plate in the incubator, 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNote: Don’t let the vitronectin solution dry on the wells before addition of the cell suspension.\nMaintenance of iPSCs in culture.\nThe StemFlex culture medium needs to be changed the next day without the ROCK inhibitor and will then be changed at least every 2–3 days.\nNote: Considerable cell death could occur and changing media helps to remove floating dead cells. Adherent cells should be visible as small colonies.\nNote: During iPSC thawing and passaging, different seeding cell densities could be tried to obtain the best density. Ideally, there should be enough distance between individual cell colonies to provide space for cell growth (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Adapt the volume of the media and timing of media change in relationship to the cell density to ensure that all iPSCs are well supported (ie: more frequent media changes are needed when there is a high number of cells in one well).",
    "Note: Small iPSC colonies should appear over 2–3 days with only one cell type visible. If there are multiple pre-differentiated cell types, the iPSCs need to be passaged further to obtain high quality iPSCs. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] “problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]”.\nNote: iPSCs need to be passaged before the individual colonies merge with each other as seen in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nNote: It is difficult to give an optimal iPSC seeding density because they are in colonies and a count of the individual cells is an inaccurate parameter for cell seeding of colonies.\nCritical: It is crucial to start the NPCs induction with well-formed iPSC colonies at the optimal confluency (70%–80%). The iPSC colonies should have a compact centre and well-defined edges with no differentiated cells (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). Undifferentiated iPSCs are the rounded cells inside the cluster.\niPSC to NPC induction.\nCoat a 6-well plate with Matrigel (pure Matrigel solution prepared following the manufacture’s instruction, see “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] point 1a”) for 1 h at 37°C, 1 mL Matrigel each well.\nNote: Matrigel will start to gel up above 10°C, so materials and solutions need to be cold for the coating. It is recommended to incubate the plate and pipette tips in the freezer 10–15 minutes before starting the coating and to keep the Matrigel on ice.\nNote: Matrigel coating needs to be coated at 37°C at least 30 min. The coating can be done overnight (up to 16 hours) but it is not recommended to coat the plate more than 24 hours.\nMake up basal [RDM] and [RDMi] media according to the materials tables. Prepare 2 mL [RDMi] media for each well (6-well plate).\nAspirate the media carefully in the wells with good iPSC colonies.\nWash the iPSCs gently with warm DMEM-F12. Aspirate gently.",
    "Add 1 mL ReLeSR per well, and then aspirate ReLeSR after 5 s.\nNote: Make sure that ReLeSR is in contact with all the iPSC colonies. This is usually achieved by rotating the plate a few times before aspirating the ReLeSR.\nStart the timer for 7 min at 20–25°C. Wells are dry (without media) during this period.\nNote: It is recommended that colonies are observed under a microscope during the detachment step. Once the central cells in the colony start to break away with visible gaps, the cell monolayer is ready to be harvested. It generally takes 5–6 minutes but can fluctuate depending on the iPSC lines and the cell density.\niPSCs should detach spontaneously, if not gently tap the plate.\nNote: Do not let the colonies break into single cells. At the start of NPC induction, the cells are still pluripotent and need to be in colonies/aggregates to survive (3–6 cells).\nAdd 1 mL [RDM] basal media to each well and collect detached iPSCs colonies gently into 10 mL tubes to obtain the iPSC suspension.\nNote: Do not pipette up and down too many times (3 times at most), otherwise the colonies will disaggregate into sizes that are too small for the cells to survive. An optimal size is 3–6 cells per colony.\nAspirate Matrigel and add [RDMi] media to the coated well, 2 mL per well.\nAdd 20 μL, 50 μL or 100 μL of iPSCs suspension into each well of the coated plates, with a dilution factor of 1:50, 1:20 and 1:10, respectively. Check the cell density under the microscope.",
    "Critical: It is fundamental to use different dilutions of iPSC suspensions for the NPC induction to optimise the seeding density of iPSC colonies. It is critical to have the correct density of iPSC colonies seeded. The cells need to be induced for 7 days without passaging; if too many colonies are seeded, cells will rapidly exhaust the supply of small molecules present in the induction media [RDMi] by the end of the induction (days 5–7). If insufficient colonies are seeded it can affect the cell survival. When starting with iPSC at 70%–80% confluency in the well prior to harvesting, a dilution factor of 1:20 should be optimal. However, as the extent of iPSCs disaggregation into small colonies is difficult to control, it is highly recommended to trial out different dilutions to obtain the optimal seeding density (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nIncubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2, for 7 days.\nChange media with fresh [RDMi] and small molecules every day for 7 days.\nNote: Cells need to be carefully monitored, specially at days 5‒7. If the media becomes yellow, it indicates that the cells might have exhausted the small molecules, with the risk of a poor NPC induction. If the cell density is not ideal, the volume of the media per well may need to be increased or changed twice a day (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nNPCs maintenance and creation of a NPCs cell bank\nTiming: 4 days per passage\nAt day 7 of induction, the cells should have adopted a NPC fate, and they are ready to be passaged, expanded and frozen down to generate a cell bank for subsequent neuronal differentiation.",
    "Note: For NPC quality control, cells can be stained with iPSC and/or NPC specific marker antibodies at different stages of induction. For a list of recommended antibodies, please refer to Wang et al. 2023.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNPCs passage.\nCoat a 6-well plate with Matrigel for 1 h at 37°C, 1 mL Matrigel each well.\nNote: Matrigel needs to be coated at 37°C for at least 30 min. The coating can be done overnight (up to 16 hours) but it is not recommended to coat the plate more than 24 hours.\nMake up basal [RDM] and [RDMm] media according to the materials tables. Prepare 2 mL [RDMm] media for each well.\nAspirate the media carefully.\nWash NPCs gently with DMEM-F12. Aspirate gently.\nAdd 0.5 mL accutase in each well.\nNote: Accutase is frozen as stock in 5 mL aliquots and should be thawed at 20–25°C. Do not thaw accutase at 37°C.\nNote: DMEM-F12 used for the washes doesn’t need to be pre-warmed at 37°C.\nIncubate 5 min at 37°C.\nAdd 1.5 mL -DMEM-F12 to each well.\nDetach the NPCs gently by tapping the plate.\nPipette up and down three times and collect detached cells gently into 10-mL Falcon tubes to obtain the NPC suspension.\nNote: Pipetting up and down three times should be enough to detach the cells and generate a single cell suspension.\nAlternative: If pipetting doesn’t break up the cell clusters, a cell strainer (40 μm diameter) can be used to break the cell clusters and to obtain a single cell solution.\nFor the first passage of NPCs (Induction P0 to NPC P1), dilute the cell suspension by a 1:3 dilution factor (therefore 2 mL of cell suspension obtained from each well can be expanded into 3 new wells at 2 mL per well).",
    "Centrifuge cell suspension at 200 g for 3 min at 20–25°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in [RDMm] media with small molecules.\nNote: For 2 mL of cell suspension centrifuged, cells should be resuspended in 6 mL [RDMm] media and will then split into 3 different wells.\nNote: For reference, NPCs can be passaged and seeded at 30,000 cells/cm2. However, the cell survival rate of single-cell NPC suspension can fluctuate between 50%‒90% depending on cell density and passage number. Hence, seeding a definitive number of NPCs may result in varied confluency of surviving NPCs. Applying the 1:3 dilution factor generally results in more consistent NPC cultures than following exact seeding numbers.\nOptional: The ROCK inhibitor Y27632 can be added to the [RDMm] media to promote cell survival during NPC passaging. However, do not leave Y27632 in the media longer than 24 hours.\nAspirate the Matrigel and add resuspended cell suspension to the coated well, 2 mL per well.\nIncubate the NPCs at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNPCs maintenance.\nChange media every 2 days.\nNPCs monolayer are ready for the next passage at 80%–90% confluency. Repeat step 6 to expand the NPCs further.\nNote: it takes 3–5 days for the NPCs to reach confluency again and to be passaged.\nTo freeze down NPCs, repeat steps 6a to 6i to detach the NPCs and collect the cell suspension.\nCentrifuge NPCs suspension at 200 g for 3 min at RT.\nCount NPCs and freeze 1 × 106 NPCs in one vial.\nResuspend NPCs in CryoStor CS10 (freezing media).\nTransfer 500 μL of NPCs in freezing media per vial.\nTransfer vial in a special freezing container to allows the temperature to slowly cool down and keep at least 4 h at ‒80°C.\nTransfer NPCs frozen vial in the liquid nitrogen for longer storage.",
    "Pause point: NPCs can be frozen and thawed when needed.\nIf thawing NPCs:\nRepeat steps 6a and 6b coat the plate and prepare media.\nTransfer the NPCs from liquid nitrogen and thaw cells quickly in a water bath at 37°C.\nAdd 5 mL [RDM] basal media to the cells drop-wise while shaking.\nCentrifuge at 200 g for 3 min at 20–25°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in [RDMm].\nAspirate the Matrigel and seed NPCs into the Matrigel-coated 6-well plates, incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2, until the NPCs are confluent (80%–90% confluency) and ready for the next passage or to be seeded for the neuronal differentiation.\nNote: It is recommended to include the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 in the [RDMm] media when thawing NPCs. Do not leave Y27632 in the media longer than 24 hours.\nNote: NPCs can be expanded and frozen down from many passages. However, for an optimal neuronal differentiation, it is recommended to use NPCs passaged between P3 and P10.\nNote: For each new batch of NPCs induction, it is important to test that neurons can be generated from the NPC cell bank following after a freeze/thaw cycle.\nNPC to neuron differentiation\nTiming: 7–28 days\nIn this third step, NPCs are terminally differentiated into neurons. An established protocol has been adapted to differentiate NPCs into mature neurons3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] with modification.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Seeded NPCs are noted as “differentiation day 0” in the differentiation timeline. Using NPCs as the starting point generates a highly reproducible timeline for neuronal differentiation. We decided to stop the neuronal culture after 28 days, but it can be stopped at any time.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3106_9.csv\nNote: Researcher should label each new procedure with the date of differentiation to maintain a comprehensive record.\nSeeding NPCs for neuronal differentiation.",
    "Coat wells, coverslips or chamber slides with poly-L-ornithine at 20 μg/mL, 250 μL per well for 24-well plates, for at least 2 h at 37°C.\nNote: Poly L-ornithine is diluted at 1:5 in ultra-pure water at 0.01% ; ie: 1 mL of poly-L-ornithine in 4 mL of water.\nPause point: The coating with poly-L-ornithine can be done overnight.\nWash the wells or coverslips with ultrapure sterile water (or PBS) 3 times.\nNote: Make sure that wells or coverslips are dry before adding the laminin.\nCoat wells, coverslips or chamber slides with laminin at 20 μg/mL, 250 μL per well for 24-well plates, 37°C for at least 2 h.\nNote: Laminin is expensive, so it is recommended to calculate exactly how much is needed for the seeding according to the laminin aliquot available. One aliquot of 1 μg laminin is diluted in 5–10 mL of cold PBS, and stored at ‒20°C. The frozen laminin aliquot needs to be spun down few seconds and thawed on ice for 10/15 minutes. Pipette tips need to be pre-cooled in the fridge when handling laminin.\nAlternative: Matrigel can be used as a cheaper alternative to laminin with 1 mL per well (6 well plate), but neurons seeded on Matrigel tend to detach more easily than those seeded on laminin from the second week of differentiation onwards.\nMake up basal [N2B21] media and [N2B21+] media with growth factors according to the materials tables. Prepare 250 μL [N2B21+] media per well for a 24-well plate.\nAspirate media on NPC monolayers carefully.\nWash NPC monolayers gently with -DMEM-F12. Aspirate gently.\nAdd 0.5 mL accutase to each well.\nIncubate 5 min at 37°C.\nAdd 1.5 mL DMEM-F12 to each well.\nDetach NPCs gently by tapping the plate.",
    "Collect detached cells gently into 10-mL Falcon tubes to obtain the NPC suspension.\nCount cells.\nNote: 3 × 104 NPCs are seeded into one well of a 24-well plate, which corresponds to a cell density of 1.58 × 104 cells/cm2. The number can be adjusted according to the purpose of the experiment (ie: seeding higher number of cells to obtain a denser neuronal network). Do not seed cells at a density lower than 1 × 104 cells per well; neurons will be too sparse and without adequate neuronal connections will affect the cell survival.\nOptional: If the NPCs are to be cultured for multiple purposes (ie: neuronal differentiation, NPC maintenance and/or NPC freezing), distribute the specific volume of NPC suspension for each purpose in individual 10-mL Falcon tube. Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] above can be used as an example to calculate the correct volume of NPC cell suspension required for each purpose.\nCentrifuge NPC suspension at 200 g for 3 min at RT.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend NPCs in [N2B21+] media with small molecules and the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (5 μL in 10 mL final).\nNote: if the NPC are divided into individual Falcon tubes for different purposes, resuspend with the correct media and correct volume for each purpose (ie: N2B21 for NPCs seeding, RDM for NPCs maintenance and CryolStor for freezing NPCs). See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nAspirate laminin from the coated cultureware and add resuspended cells to the coated well, 250 μL per well for 24-well plates.\nNote: To be sure that the laminin does not run dry, it is better to perform step o. well by well.\nIncubate the NPCs at 37°C, 5% CO2. The seeding day corresponds to neuron differentiation Day 0 and plastiware should be labeled with the date of the differentiation day/Day 0).\nDuring the neuronal differentiation:",
    "Do a full media change with [N2B21+] containing fresh growth factors (without Y27632) at Day 1.\nFrom day 1 onwards, replace half the media volume with an equivalent volume of fresh [N2B21+] containing fresh growth factors added every 2–3 days.\nNote: By day 1 differentiation, NPCs should be in clusters, at 15/20% confluency. Dendrites can already be seen in presence of the ROCK inhibitor.\nNote: Examine the cells daily for morphological changes. A reference timeline of cell morphology during neuronal differentiation is shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nNote: The identities and development of the neurons can be validated by immunofluorescence using different NPC and/or neuronal markers at different developmental stages. For recommended antibodies working in human neurons, see Wang et al. 2023.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nAlternative: If NPC number is low at the beginning of the neuronal differentiation, the proliferation of NPCs can be enhanced by replacing the NBM basal medium with 50% DMEMF-12 and 50% NBM basal medium from day 1 to day 3. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] “problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]”.\nCritical: Do not let the wells dry when changing for fresh [N2B21+] medium. The neuronal cell layer is highly likely to detach from the surface of the well if the laminin coating is dry during media changes. Always leave a portion of a small volume of conditioned media in the well, sufficient to cover the cells.\nNote: “Conditioned media” refers to the media already used to maintain the cell culture, containing growth factors and protein secreted by the cells, present in the well.",
    "Optional: If proliferative non-neuronal cells arise in the culture, 2 μM of 5-FdU (a thymidylate synthase inhibitor) can be added to the culture around Day 10 until fixation at Day 14 to kill proliferating cells. Alternatively, neurons can be detached and replated to physically separate the neuronal layer to non-neuronal cells from the more adherent non-neuronal cells. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] “problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]” and Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nMonitoring neuronal differentiation using the IncuCyte\nTiming: 7–28 days\nThe complete timeline of the neuronal differentiation from NPCs (differentiation day 0), can be monitored with long-term live cell imaging using the IncuCyte instrument. The IncuCyte is a wide-field imaging system inside of an incubator which can image cultured cells without disturbing their environment. This protocol can be adapted for other cell imaging microscopes (i.e.,: CELLCYTE X™, Olympus Viva View FL). In this last step, a protocol is described which can record the neuronal dynamics during the different steps of the neurogenesis, as well as the dynamics of intracellular organelles, such as the Golgi apparatus (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Organelles can be followed in live cell using specific dye and/or by the transfection or transduction with fluorescent tagged-organelle markers plasmids (for reference see Wang et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nSeed NPCs with [N2B21+] in culture dishes compatible with the IncuCyte system (and begin NPC differentiation to neurons as described in steps 10a to 10q). In this protocol an 8 wells iBidi μ-Slide was used for imaging.",
    "Note: Most of the common culture well plates or chambers are compatible with the IncuCyte. To check if a specific cultureware is supported, search in the “Vessel Type Search” page which lists all the cultureware that could be used inside the IncuCyte. If a glass-bottom cultureware is needed for high imaging resolution and/or neuronal attachment, it is recommended to use slide chambers such as an iBidi μ-Slide.\nOn day 1 of neuronal differentiation, add BODIPY TR Ceramide Golgi dye to the culture media (ready-to-use solution) at 1:1000 dilution.\nNote: Add the Golgi dye to the culture media every 2–3 days.\nPut the iBidi μ-Slide inside the IncuCyte imaging system and clip it securely on the slide holder.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3106-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Set-up of the IncuCyte system at the start of the long-term imaging experiment\n(A) In “Scan Settings”, select objectives, acquisition channels and acquisition time. An example is shown with a 20X objective and two channels (phase contrast and Red channel) set to default acquisition time.\n(B) In “Scan Pattern”, select wells to be imaged and positions imaged per well. Two example patterns are shown: one with 16 positions per well and 4 wells selected (left), and one with 9 positions per well and 8 wells selected (right).\n(C) In “Scan Schedule”, select the scan interval/frequency and the end point of the imaging experiment. An example imaging timeline is shown to acquire images every 2 h indefinitely until the experiment is stopped.\nNote: To achieve long-term imaging of the same field, it is important to secure the plates firmly on the plate holder. This is to ensure that the same position in the well is imaged at each timepoint. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] “problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]”.",
    "Alternative: Other methods to identify the Golgi or other organelles can be adopted, such as transducing the neurons with fluorescently labelled organelle markers, or the use of other cell painting reagents such as the lysotracker or mitotracker.\nSet-up the parameters for imaging following the prompt from the system (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nNote: The IncuCyte scans cultured cells on a selected schedule (e.g. every hour) which can continue indefinitely as long as the cells to be imaged are healthy (up to 28 days in this protocol). Each scan will take a defined time, and the maximum duration for a single scan need to be half of the acquisition time interval (ie: to scan every 30 minutes, the duration for a single scan cannot exceed 15 minutes). It is important to set up the scan time and frequency so that it is within the limit but maximised to generate sufficient data for the purpose of the experiments. The duration of a single scan depends of: (1) number of channel used, (2) duration of the acquisition for each channel, (3) number of chambers, (4) number of wells imaged, and (5) number of positions or fields imaged per well, which is explained in the following steps.\nIn “Scan Settings”, select objective, acquisition channels and acquisition time (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Here, a 20X objective is used with two channels (phase contrast for neuronal morphology and RFP for Golgi dye) with default acquisition time (400 ms).",
    "Note: The default acquisition time (300 ms for the green channel, 400 ms for the red channel) works well for most experiments. The acquisition time can be increased for dim signals, but this risks phototoxicity and prolonged scanning time for each scan. Phenol red in culture medium does not generate any noticeable effect on the red channel. If phenol red generates autofluorescence on the green channel, phenol-free media should be used.\nIn “Scan Pattern”, select wells to be imaged and positions imaged per well (for pattern examples see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In this protocol, 16 positions/fields imaged per well were imaged for the 8 wells of the iBidi μ-slide.\nNote: The more wells imaged and/or more positions imaged per well, the longer the duration for each scan will be. A “scan duration” is estimated at this set-up step for the pattern chosen (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The scan duration should not exceed half of the acquisition interval/frequency.\nIn “Scan Schedule”, select the scan interval/frequency (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Set up the end point of the imaging experiment as well (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In this protocol, cells are imaged every 30 min for up to 28 days.\nNote: The default scanning schedule starts on the hour (i.e: scanning will start exactly at 10 am, 11 am, 12 pm, if chosen to image every hour). This can be changed by dragging the timeline as seen in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], but it is recommended to follow the default schedule so that it is clear at what time the IncuCyte is imaging. This is convenient for changing media for the cells (see step 15).\nNote: It is recommended to select “Scan indefinitely” (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The experiment can be stopped at any time by deleting the schedule. The IncuCyte will continue scanning the slide until the experiment is deleted.",
    "Change the media every 2/3 days as you would do for neurons cultured in the incubator.\nNote: Only change media when the IncuCyte is not imaging/operating. The available time to change media can be calculated by the scanning duration and frequency. For example, if (1) the IncuCyte is imaging every 30 minutes, (2) each scan takes 7 minutes, and (3) the scan starts exactly on the hour; then the IncuCyte will be imaging from 10:00 to 10:07 am, and a media change can be performed from 10:08 to 10:29 am.\nCheck the status of the cells and the IncuCyte regularly during the long-term imaging to make sure neurons are healthy and the imaging settings are good.\nNote: In the middle of an imaging experiment, scans already done are accessible anytime in the “View” function of the IncuCyte software.\nNote: After two weeks of differentiation, neurons can be in a 3D cluster instead of a monolayer, in which case they can be detached and re-seeded in a new coated slide and the analysis continued. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] “problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]”.\nNote: Having a duplicate neuron plate in the cell culture incubator (not the IncuCyte incubator) can be a good quality control and a backup in case of any technical fault associated with collection of images during the IncuCyte experiment.\nExport the image series from the IncuCyte when the imaging is finished.\nAnalyze the image series using the image analysis software according to the requirements of the experiment.\nNote: When exporting data, it is recommended to choose the option to export images “as stored”. This will export the raw images for each timepoint with full image quality. In this protocol, raw tif images were reconstructed using the software FIJI/ImageJ to a time-series using the “images to stack” function.",
