    "This research protocol has been approved by the Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee.\n1. MEG Familiarization Resources\nProvide families with resources to learn about MEG prior to visiting the MEG laboratory, such as a child-friendly scientific article7 explaining MEG and the MSR, a story-board detailing the steps involved in completing the MEG experiment (e.g., Supplementary Figure 1 and an MEG information sheet for parents or caregivers (e.g., Supplementary Figure 2).\n2. MEG Familiarization Session\nNOTE: The familiarization session typically runs for 30 min, including an introduction to the MSR (5 minutes), a practice digitization (5 min), and MEG simulator training, including practice on the experimental task (20 min). Conduct the familiarization session between one-to-seven days prior to data acquisition.\nMSR introduction\nTake the child on a tour of the MSR (\"spaceship\") which is decorated in space-related wall art to reinforce the space mission theme.\nAsk the child to practice lying back with their head in the helmet dewar.\nTell the child to lie as still as possible so that the spaceship stays on course and can reach its final destination.\nDigitization:\nSeat the child on a high chair and fit them with a polyester swimming cap (\"astronaut helmet\") containing five marker coils. Adapt loose-fitting caps by folding up the sides. NOTE: The coils send data to a continuous motion tracking unit.\nPlace a transmitter and three receivers around the child's neck.\nAsk the child to demonstrate their best 'statue' pose and offer frequent positive reinforcement when they stay still.\nNOTE: This serves to minimize head movement during digitization that may compromise the accuracy of the subsequent co-registration with the MEG sensors8.",
    "Use a pen digitizer (see Table of Materials) to record the position of three fiducial points (the nasion and left and right pre-auricular points) and the five marker coils, as well as the shape of the surface of the head. NOTE: This data is used to later determine the position of the child's head in relation to the MEG sensors.\nRemove the cap, transmitter and three receivers from the child's neck.\nMEG simulator:\nTake the child to the room housing the MEG simulator (see Table of Materials and steps 9 and 10 in Supplementary Figure 1), a full-size replica of an MEG system. The MEG simulator is decorated with space-themed stickers and is equipped with a mock helmet dewar, a bed, a button box and, for visual displays, a screen situated above the mock dewar\nBriefly describe the MEG scanning procedures (i.e., lying still and participating in the practice experimental task) through the narrative of a practice space mission.\nFit the child with an 'astronaut helmet' — a polyester swimming cap which has a motion detector attached at the front (see Table of Materials).\nInvite the child to lie in the simulator and watch a video of their choosing. If the child appears nervous, first demonstrate the experimental procedures with a toy.\nNOTE: Whenever the child's head movement exceeds a pre-determined threshold (e.g., 5 mm), the motion tracking system (see Table of Materials) will automatically pause the video and wait for the experimenter to manually restart the video and restore the movement baseline.\nWhen the child completes this part of the simulator training, provide the child with training on the experimental task using a separate set of unique stimuli.\nAt the end of the task training, offer the child an astronaut training certificate.\n3. MEG Data Acquisition Session",
    "NOTE: The data acquisition session typically runs for approximately 30 min, including digitization (5 min), setting up the participant inside the MSR (5 min) and data acquisition (approximately 20 min, depending on the length of the experimental paradigm).\nPreliminary procedures\nConduct a 30-to-60 s empty room recording approximately 15 min before the child arrives to identify any significant external noise that is detected by the MEG system8.\nWhen the child arrives, confirm that they are not wearing any magnetic material on their clothes or carrying any in their body, as magnetic materials can distort the MEG signal (see Figure 1B for an example of signal noise due to metal on the participant).\nNOTE: If the parent or caregiver wishes to accompany their child inside the MSR, the removal of magnetic materials applies to them too.\nDigitization\nCheck whether the child needs to go to the toilet before commencing digitization, as once the digitization step is completed, the cap cannot be removed until the MEG acquisition session has finished.\nRepeat the digitization procedure outlined in the \"MEG familiarization session\" section above.\nNOTE: If the cap moves more than 5 mm over the course of the experiment, perform a second digitization at the end of the experiment\nMSR set-up\nTake the child to the MSR (\"the spaceship\").\nNOTE: Two researchers are required for this procedure — one to accompany the child inside the MSR as the \"assistant researcher\" (along with the parent or caregiver, if desired) and one to run MEG data acquisition outside the MSR as the \"main researcher\". The MSR set-up typically takes 5 min.\nSet up equipment inside the MSR (assistant researcher)\n\t\t\nAsk the child to place their head into the helmet dewar.",
    "Check that the child's head is centrally aligned such that the crown of the head is as close as possible to the back of the helmet dewar without touching.\nEnsure that the child is comfortable, relaxed, and remains as still as possible during MEG recording.\nDuring the set-up, keep the child entertained by playing a video of their choosing on a screen above the dewar.\nSet up equipment outside the MSR (main researcher)\n\t\t\nConduct a pre-experiment/baseline marker coil measurement to record the initial head position with respect to the helmet dewar.\nConduct a co-registration between the child's head and the sensor array using both the initial marker coil measurement and the digitization head shape data.\nNOTE: These preparatory measurements enable visual inspection of head position inside the dewar to ensure that the child's head is correctly positioned. If these conditions are not met, re-position the child and conduct another co-registration before starting data acquisition.\nData acquisition\nOnce satisfied with the head position with respect to the helmet dewar, start the MEG recording and the experimental task.\nRecord ongoing head movements with a pediatric MEG software system called Real-Time Head Movement (ReTHM)9.\nEnding the experiment\nWhen the experimental task is finished, turn off ReTHM and end the MEG recording. Conduct a post-experiment marker coil measurement to measure the final head position with respect to the helmet dewar.\nNOTE: This measurement provides a simple visual inspection of overall head movements during the experiment.\nOffer the child a gift bag (\"astronaut kit\") for their participation and remunerate the family for their time and travel costs."
