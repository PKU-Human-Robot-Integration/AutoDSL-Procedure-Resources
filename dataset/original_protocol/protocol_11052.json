    "Prior ethical approval was obtained from participating centers before the extraction of blood samples. The following protocols for serum and plasma isolation were performed in accordance with the ethical principles for biomedical research.\nNOTE: Prior considerations before beginning the protocol are provided here. Prior ethical approval is required for the use of human samples in biomedical research, with the corresponding informed consent. A class II biosafety cabinet is required to handle blood samples. A lab coat, protective gloves, and glasses should be worn throughout the procedure to avoid infection by blood-borne pathogens. A minimum of 30 min is required for the processing of serum samples. After blood extraction in tubes without anticoagulant, maintain at room temperature (RT) for 30-45 min to allow clot formation. A minimum of 40 min is required for plasma preparation, and samples should be processed within 4 h from the time of extraction when using ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) tubes or within 24-48 h if using cell stabilizing collection tubes or specific cell-free DNA collection tubes. However, according to some manufacturers, the samples are stable for up to 2 weeks in these specialized tubes. It is important to check for hemolysis, which will give the plasma or serum fraction a reddish appearance. See the troubleshooting section for hemolyzed samples in the discussion.\n1. Serum preparation for liquid biopsy studies\nNOTE: Total time required to perform this step is 30 min (Figure 1).\nExtract 4-10 mL of blood in tubes containing no anticoagulant (red or red/gray-black cap) and maintain at RT for 30-45 min. Process these samples within 4 h from the time of extraction.\nRecord the time and date of the sample extraction and the subject identification (ID) in an appropriately designed sample database.",
    "Wearing a lab coat, protective gloves and glasses, centrifuge the tube containing fresh blood at RT (15 °C-25 °C) for 10 min at 1,600 (± 150) x g, with the maximum break applied.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully remove the tube from the centrifuge; the upper phase of serum supernatant will appear clear and yellowish (Figure 2). Check whether the sample shows signs of hemolysis (Figure 3) and record the presence of hemolysis when appropriate.\nIn a class II biosafety cabinet, transfer the serum to collection tubes as 250 µL aliquots.\n\tNOTE: The volume of the aliquots must be adjusted to the study requirements.\nImmediately freeze the serum upright in a storage box at -80 °C and record the time of sample storage.\nVerify that the samples were processed within the required 4 h time frame.\n2. Plasma preparation for liquid biopsy studies\nNOTE: The total time required to perform this step is 40 min (Figure 4).\nExtract 4-10 mL of blood in tubes containing ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA). Process the sampleswithin 4 h from the time of extraction.\nRecord the time and date of the sample extraction and the subject ID in an appropriately designed sample database.\nWearing a lab coat, protective gloves, and glasses, centrifuge the EDTA tube at RT (15 °C-25 °C) for 10 min at 1,600 (± 150) x g, with the maximum break applied.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the manufacturer's instructions when using other collection tubes.",
    "After centrifugation, the plasma supernatant will appear clear and yellowish. Check whether the sample shows signs of hemolysis (Figure 3) and transfer the plasma (supernatant) to a 15 mL centrifuge tube without disturbing the cellular layer using a disposable serological pipette (or disposable bulb pipette or p1000 pipettes with filter tip). Leave a small residual volume of plasma above the cell layer (approximately 5 mm).\nIf hemolysis is observed, discard the sample for further analyses. (Figure 5). See the troubleshooting section in the Discussion to assess hemolysis.\nCentrifuge the plasma in a 15 mL centrifuge tube at RT (15 °C-25 °C) for 10-20 min at 3,000 (±150) x g. Perform this step to remove any residual intact blood cells carried over from the first centrifugation step.\nAfter centrifugation, carefully remove the tube from the centrifuge and transfer 1-4 mL of plasma to 1-4 mL polypropylene cryogenic vials using a disposable serological pipette (or disposable bulb pipette or p1000 pipettes with filter tip). A residual volume of plasma (approximately 0.3 mL or 7 mm height) must be left at the bottom of the tube to avoid contaminating the plasma with blood cells (Figure 5).\nImmediately freeze the plasma upright in the storage box at -80 °C and record the time of sample storage. Verify that the samples were processed within the required 4 h time frame.\nCollect the cellular layer (buffy coat) using a P1000 and filtered tip and transfer it to a 2 mL tube. Immediately freeze and store at -80 °C.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
