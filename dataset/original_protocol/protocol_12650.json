  "procedures": [
    "The TB used in this study was named as BT18, which originated from the breed of \"JinQiao No.2\" cultivated by the Research Center of Small Miscellaneous Grain of Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Science. The primary steps of this protocol are illustrated in Figure 1.\nNOTE: Operate explants-related manipulation rapidly, and when possible, keep the Petri dishes closed to avoid wilting and contamination. Unless otherwise stated, all the explant incubations were conducted under the condition of a 14-h light and a 10-h dark photoperiod at 25 °C. Unless otherwise stated, all explants- or bacteria-related operations were performed under aseptic conditions in a laminar flow hood. All the media ingredients for A. rhizogenes and in vitro plant cultures are provided in Table 1. After adjusting the pH, all media were autoclaved at 120 °C for 20 min. Solidified media were prepared by filling 25 mL of medium into a Petri dish of 9-cm diameter and allowing it to solidify.\nCAUTION: Deposit all the genetically modified bacteria and plants into the appropriate waste container. Operate all hazardous chemicals in a fume cupboard and deposit them in the hazardous waste container.\n1. Preparation of TB explants\nPreparation of TB seeds\n\t\nSelect plump and undamaged TB seeds (Figure 1A1) that have been preserved at a temperature less than−20 °C for no more than 2 years.\nSoak the seeds in water at 28 °C for approximately 20 min so that the seed coat can be easily peeled off (Figure 1A2). If necessary, use scissors to cut a slot on the seeds to facilitate the peeling.\nSterilization of TB seeds\n\t\nPlace 100–200 peeled seeds into a 100 mL sterilized conical flask.\nDisinfect the seeds using 75% ethanol for 30 s.\nReplace the ethanol with 5% sodium hypochlorite and disinfect for 15 min.",
    "NOTE: Disinfection using mercury bichloride at a concentration of 1 g/L for 8 min may be used as an alternative sterilizer to replace sodium hypochlorite in any case of inadequate sterilization.\n\t\tCAUTION: Mercury bichloride is hazardous and not an environment-friendly material. Operate it in the fuming cupboard and deposit it into the hazardous waste container, if mercury bichloride is used in any case.\nPour out the sodium hypochlorite.\nWash the seeds using sterile deionized water 5 times.\nBlot the seeds dry with a sterile bibulous paper.\nPreparation of TB seedlings\n\t\nPrepare 50 mL Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium (1962) supplemented with 30 g/L sucrose and 7 g/L agar powder (MSSA) (Table 1) in a 300 mL plant tissue culture bottle.\nAdjust the pH to 5.8 before autoclaving.\nDistribute 10 seeds evenly per bottle of MSSA medium.\nGerminate the seeds in a culture room at 25 °C ± 1 °C under the light condition for 7–10 days.\nPreparation of sterile explants\n\t\nSelect robust seedlings of TB (Figure 1C), when the 2 pieces of cotyledons are unfolded.\nCut off the seedlings from the roots (Figure 1C red-dash arrowheads), avoiding contact with the medium.\nPlace them in a sterile Petri dish.\nCut the hypocotyls into 0.8–1 cm segments, and shear the cotyledons into approximately 0.5 cm pieces.\nPreculture these explants on MSSA medium under the light condition for 24 h.\nTransfer them into a 100 mL sterilized conical flask, which are now ready for infection.\n2. Preparation of A. rhizogenes for transformation",
    "NOTE: The A. rhizogenes strain ACCC10060 was kindly provided by the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development and preserved at −80 °C. A. rhizogenes was transformed with the binary vector pK7GWIWG2D (II) that harbors a T-DNA carrying the b4 gene accompanying a GFP as an indicator gene and the Kan resistance gene as a selectable marker. The gene b4 is a member of the transcription factor bHLH family, which has not yet been published. To evaluate the potential of TB hairy roots, A. rhizogenes was transformed with the binary vector pK7WG2D containing the MYB116 gene to investigate its effect on the production of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids at the level of gene expression and by metabolic analyses. Activated A. rhizogenes should be well prepared at the same time with the explants.\nActivation of A. rhizogenes\nThaw A. rhizogenes on ice\nDip the bacteria and line them evenly onto yeast mannitol medium (YEB) supplemented with 15 g/L agar powder, 50 mg/L rifampicin, and 50 mg/L spectinomycin (YEBARS, pH 7.0).\nIncubate the bacteria at 28 °C for 12–16 h.\nPick a monoclonal colony and culture it in another Petri dish in the same above-described manner.\nSelect monoclonal colonies and culture them in a 100 mL sterilized conical flask containing 20 mL of YEB medium supplemented with 50 mg/L rifampicin and 50 mg/L spectinomycin (YEBRS, pH 7.0) at 28 °C and 200 rpm for 16–18 h until the OD600 value reaches 2.0.\nIncubate 2%–4% of the abovementioned culture in another 100-mL conical flask containing 20 mL of YEBRS medium at 28 °C and 200 rpm for 4-5 h until the OD600 value reaches approximately 0.5 (Figure 1D).\n3. Infection and screening of TB explants",
    "NOTE: The objective of this protocol is to obtain genetically transformed hairy roots. The wild-type roots were used as the negative control to assess the transgenic expression. In this protocol, A. rhizogenes was transformed with binary vector either pK7WG2D carrying the gene of FtMYB116 or pK7GWIWG2D (II) carrying the gene of b4 in advance.\nResuspension of A. rhizogenes\nTransfer the culture obtained in step 2.1.6 into a 50-mL sterilized centrifugal tube.\nSpin at 4,000 x g for 10 min at 20 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet with MS medium supplemented with 30 g/L sucrose and 300 μM acetosyringone (AS) (MSSAS, pH 5.8) to OD600 ≈ 0.2.\nInfection of explants\n\t\nInfuse the bacterial suspension obtained in step 3.1.3 into a conical flask containing the explants prepared in step 1.4.6 for 10 min (Figure 1E).\nTake out the explants, and blot them dry using a sterile bibulous paper.\n4. Coculture of explants with A. rhizogenes\nPlace a sterile 9 cm diameter filter paper on the MS medium, which is solidified using 7 g/L agar powder supplemented with 30 g/L sucrose and 100 μM AS (MSSAAS medium, pH 5.2).\nOverlay the explants on the filter paper at 25 °C for 3 days in the dark (Figure 1F).\n5. Induction and selective culture\nPlace approximately 20 infected explants on the MSSA medium supplemented with 500 mg/L cefotaxime and 50 mg/L kanamycin (Kan) (MSSACK, pH 5.8) (Figure 1G).\nIncubate them vertically under the light condition at 25 °C ± 1 °C. The hairy roots occur approximately 1 week after incubation (Figure 1H black-dash arrowheads indicate occurrence of hairy roots).\n\tNOTE: Replace MSSACK medium every 15 days if necessary.\n6. Subculturing TB hairy roots",
    "NOTE: This procedure aims to harvest vigorous hairy roots. Regularly observe the growth of hairy roots during propagation, and remove the contaminated and inactivated ones in a timely manner. If necessary, repeat the following steps to propagate more hairy roots. It takes approximately 10–14 days from subculturing to harvest.\nSelect the hairy roots showing white appearance and rapid growth.\nCut them into pieces of 2-3 cm.\nClearly number them on a clean bench.\nSubculture them in a 100 mL sterilized conical flask containing 5 mL of MS medium supplemented with 30 g/L sucrose and 50 mg/L Kan (MSSK, pH 5.8) at a rotary speed of 80 rpm at 25 °C in the dark until they overspread to the bottom of the flask (Figure 1I).\n7. Identification of transformed hairy roots and conservation\nNOTE: Transformed hairy roots can be identified based on the aspects of morphology and gene level. Identification can also be conducted according to the hairy root genome and resistance, which are not covered in this protocol. This procedure primarily focuses on reporter gene and target gene identification.\nRemove tawny and contaminated hairy roots and select those with white appearance.\nEvaluate if there is green fluorescence under a blue/light dual ultraviolet transilluminator.\nSelect the hairy roots exhibiting a strong fluorescence signal in the numbered tubes or wrapped using a marked tinfoil after drying them out with an absorbent paper.\nLyophilize them in liquid nitrogen, followed by storing all the harvest at −80 °C for further investigation.\nGene identification\n\t\nTriturate 0.1 g of the hairy roots into fine powder in liquid nitrogen.\nPrepare the genomic DNA of independent transgenic lines of TB using the modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method25 according to the instruction of the manufacturer of the plant genomic DNA kit.",
    "Perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 100 ng of genomic DNA template and primers listed in Table 2.\nPerform the amplification cycle as follows: predenaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 30 s. After 36 cycles and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min, analyze the amplification products on 1% agarose gels.\nStain the gels with nucleic acid staining and visualize them under UV light.\nSubscription Required.
