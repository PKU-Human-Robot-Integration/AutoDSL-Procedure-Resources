    "This present study has been developed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, which establishes ethical principles for the development of research with humans. In addition, it follows the guidelines and was approved by the University of Malaga’s Experimentation Ethics Committee (CEUMA).\nNOTE: The protocol presented below should be carried out by psychologists within the school setting, beginning in the first year of Primary Education (6 years of age), and with the collaboration of teachers (Figure 6).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60858/60858fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Stage of Protocol of Evaluation of Dyslexia Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60858/60858fig6large.jpg]\n1. Stage 1: Assessment of instruction\nInform parents that their children will be assessed, in order to analyze whether they are at risk of having dyslexia.\nObtain informed consent from parents so that students can be assessed periodically.\nAssess the reading and writing performance, based on the curriculum (CBM), of all the students in class, following adequate reading and writing instruction in in their regular classroom20, for two hours every day over the course of approximately six months. For the assessment of reading and writing performance based on the curriculum, use the indicators recommended by the National Reading Panel (NRP): phonological awareness, knowledge of the alphabet, vocabulary, reading fluency and comprehension24.\nFor the evaluation of these indicators, administer the test to detect dyslexia25,26 either collectively or individually, informing participants of the instructions for performing each test.\nAnalyze the scores obtained. If the majority of the students have achieved similar appropriate scores in the assessment, rule out the possibility of inadequate teaching.\n2. Stage 2: Multilevel assessment of student performance\nLevel 1: Screening\n\t\nAfter analysing the scores obtained in stage 1, identify students who are at risk of dyslexia, according to the standards established for the tests administered.",
    "Include students identified as being at risk in the next level.\nLevel 2: Assessment following group instruction\n\t\nAfter any students identified as being at risk have received frequent reading and writing instruction in small groups, (30 minutes, three to five times a week, for approximately 10 sessions), evaluate their response to that instruction, either collectively or individually24.\nTo perform this assessment, administer screening tests for dyslexia25,26, which take the aforementioned indicators into account, informing the participants of the instructions to perform each test.\nIdentify students who present a risk of dyslexia determined on the basis of low test scores, following the instruction received.\nInclude the selected students in the next level.\nLevel 3: Assessment following intensive instruction\n\t\nAfter students identified as being at risk have received even more frequent reading and writing instruction in smaller groups, evaluate their response to that instruction24.\nTo perform this assessment, administer screening tests for dyslexia, collectively or individually25,26, which take the aforementioned indicators into account, informing the participants of the instructions to perform each test.\nIdentify students who present a risk of dyslexia determined on the basis of low test scores, following the instruction received.\nInclude the students selected in the next level.\n3. Stage 3: Specific student assessment\nTo corroborate the diagnosis of dyslexia among students identified as being at risk, carry out the following assessment protocol for each student.\n\tNOTE: Students who do not present any intellectual disabilities or sensory-motor handicaps, but who do perform poorly in reading comprehension and fluency and written accuracy, and present problems in most of the cognitive-linguistic variables evaluated, as well as possible socio-emotional, family and/or school repercussions, shall be classed as having dyslexia.\nInterview with parents",
    "To begin the specific student assessment protocol, inform parents that their child needs to be evaluated extensively because they have suspected dyslexia.\nObtain informed consent from parents so that students can be assessed specifically.\nConduct a structured interview with the student’s parents, in order to gather information about their child in terms of their personal development (biological, motor, sensory, social, communicative-linguistic) and the family setting (family history, family organisation, expectations about their child's difficulties, family impact of the child’s difficulties).\nHave the psychologist ask the parents about their child's development, the existence of family history and the family setting.\nInterview with the teacher\n\t\nConduct a structured interview with the teacher, in order to find out their opinion about the problem their student might present, their personal development (motor, sensory, social, communicative-linguistic, style of learning and motivation), the classroom environment (class organisation, position of the student within the classroom, materials used by the student, the student's integration in the classroom) and their school record (schools attended, academic performance, diversity management measures received and approach to schooling).\nIn this section, have the psychologist give the teacher the following instructions: \"In order to obtain information and your opinion about the student, complete this structured interview referring to the student’s possible problem, their personal development, learning and motivation, their academic record and environment in the classroom\".\nMeasure of Intelligence\n\t\nAdminister a cognitive scale27 to assess intelligence in children, in accordance with the instructions set out in the test handbook, in order to rule out possible intellectual limitations.",
    "Analyze the student profile obtained, in order to ascertain information about the cognitive and linguistic aspects (fluent reasoning, visual-spatial, working memory, processing speed and verbal comprehension) required to make the diagnosis and to establish the affected and unaffected cognitive-linguistic areas that would justify dyslexia and rule out other problems.\nMeasure of Reading and Writing\n\t\nTo measure reading fluency and comprehension, individually carry out a reading assessment25 for children aged six.\nIn the reading fluency test, instruct the student to read a list of words and another list of pseudowords as fast as they can. Record the number they got right and the time they took to complete each test. Correct the answers in accordance with the correction criteria indicated in the test handbook.\nFor the reading comprehension test, instruct the student to read a text in silence and then answer questions about what they have read. Record the answers given by the student and correct them in accordance with the correction criteria indicated in the test handbook.\nAnalyze the student's reading profile in terms of accuracy, speed and comprehension, in accordance with the test instructions.\nTo assess written accuracy, carry out the copying and dictation test with the student26, in accordance with the instructions indicated in the test handbook.\n\t\t\nTo carry out the copying test, instruct the student to copy out several texts by hand in a maximum of one minute. Correct the student’s answers in accordance with the correction criteria indicated in the test handbook.\nTo carry out the dictation test, instruct the student to write down by hand the words they will hear in a maximum of two minutes. Correct the student’s answers in accordance with the correction criteria indicated in the test handbook.",
    "Analyze the numbers of right and wrong answers from both tests, in accordance with the correction criteria indicated in the handbook.\n4. Cognitive-linguistic measures\nAfter assessing reading and writing performance, evaluate the cognitive-linguistic variables that might explain the appearance of dyslexia24,28,29,30,31: phonological awareness, knowledge of the alphabet, naming speed, short-term memory, vocabulary, and phonological and semantic fluency.\nTo assess phonological awareness, use a phonemic segmentation test26.\n\t\nIn this test, instruct the student to repeat words after removing a certain syllable or phoneme.\nWrite down the answers given by the student and correct them in accordance with the correction criteria indicated in the test handbook.\nTo assess knowledge of the alphabet, use a letter reading test25.\n\t\nIn this test, instruct the student to say the names of the letters shown to them on printed cards.\nRecord the answers given by the student and correct them in accordance with the correction criteria indicated in the test handbook.\nTo assess naming speed, use a test for the student to name pictures26.\n\t\nIn this test, instruct the student to say the name of the pictures shown on cards as quickly as possible.\nMake a note of any errors and the time they take. Correct the test in accordance with the correction criteria indicated in the test handbook.\nTo assess short-term memory, use an inverse digit test26.\n\t\nIn this test, instruct the student to repeat in reverse order the sequence of digits they will hear.\nWrite down the answers given by the student and correct them in accordance with the criteria established in the test handbook.\nTo assess vocabulary, carry out a vocabulary test26.\n\t\nInstruct the student to simply mark the drawing that represents the word given by the examiner.\nCorrect the student’s answers in accordance with the criteria established in the test handbook.",
    "To assess phonological fluency, use a verbal fluency test26.\n\t\nIn this test, instruct the student to say in one minute all the words that begin with the sound /p/.\nWrite down the answers given by the student and correct them in accordance with the criteria established in the test handbook.\nTo assess semantic fluency, carry out a semantic fluency test26 and instruct the student to say in one minute all the animal names they know.\n\t\nWrite down the answers given by the student and correct them in accordance with the criteria established in the test handbook.\nSubscription Required.
