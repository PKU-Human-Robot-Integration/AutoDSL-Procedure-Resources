    "Dissection and sample preparationPick 3rd instar wandering larvae with a dissection needle and transfer to a 35-mm Petri dish with Drosophila Ringer’s solution. Use fine forceps to hold the larvae and swirl in Drosophila Ringer’s solution to wash off any food. 3rd instar wandering larvae are those moving away from the food source; they can be easily located on the side of vials or bottles housing flies.Note: It is best to pick larvae that are still moving and have food left in the gut. If molasses is included in the Drosophila food recipe, food in the gut can easily be identified by the dark brown color in the middle of the larvae. Otherwise, consumer food coloring can also be added to the Drosophila food to help identify larvae in the right stage. Larvae that have stopped moving or have no food left in the gut are ready to pupariate; therefore, their secretory granules would be secreted and would not be useful in determining secretory granule size. Transfer individual clean larva with fine forceps to a droplet of Drosophila Ringer’s solution (50 μl) on a silicone dissection plate.Dissect the larva under a stereomicroscope with fine forceps. Immobilize the larva by gently holding it down with forceps using the non-dominant hand. Pinch the mouth hook of the larva with the dominant hand and pull to remove the salivary glands.Clean unwanted tissues away from the salivary glands using forceps (Figure 1A) and mount the samples as demonstrated in the illustration (Figure 1B and 1C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4039/bioprotoc-11-11-4039-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Mounting of larval salivary glands on microscope slide with vacuum grease.Mounting the samples with self-adhesive reinforcement labels is fast and consistent (Figure 1B, step 6). However, to prevent anoxia, samples should be mounted with vacuum grease if a longer imaging time (>30 min) is desired (Figure 1C, step 7).Place one self-adhesive reinforcement label on the microscope slide. Ensure that the label completely adheres to the slide. Pipette 8 µl Drosophila Ringer’s solution to the middle of the label. Transfer salivary glands to the solution (3-5 pairs of salivary glands per label). Place cover slip on and seal the slide with quick-drying nail polish. Samples are good for up to 30 min (following 10 min dissection time).Dispense vacuum grease into a 5-ml syringe. Use a needle with a small gauge number. Dispense vacuum grease by drawing a square on the microscope slide using the syringe. Leave a small gap and do not complete the square. Pipette 30 µl Drosophila Ringer’s solution into the middle of the square. Transfer salivary glands to the solution (up to 8 pairs). Place cover slip on and gently push down with fine forceps until the vacuum grease seals the sample. Seal the slide with quick-drying nail polish. Samples are good for up to 50 min (following 10 min dissection time).ImagingTransfer slide to the stage of spinning-disc confocal microscope.Open Volocity 6.3 in acquisition mode. Image samples with the 60× objective. Use corresponding setting to acquire images in the green or red channel for Sgs3-GFP or Sgs3-DsRed, respectively.Capture 20 μm in Z with 0.3 µm per slice. Image at least three representative cells for each pair of glands (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4039/bioprotoc-11-11-4039-g002.jpgFigure 2.
