    "The present study and procedures were approved by the animal research ethics committees of the City University of Hong Kong, the University of Hong Kong, and the Department of Health of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n1. Animals\nUse Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of two months (N = 90, 200-250 g).\n\tNOTE: Rodents were provided by the accredited Laboratory Animal Unit of the University of Hong Kong.\nMaintain the rats under a constant 25 °C temperature and 60-70% humidity at the Laboratory Animal Research Unit.\nHouse rodents in 12/12-h light/dark cycles with access to food and drinking water, ad libitum.\nAcclimate rodents to the housing environment for at least one day prior to CHL surgery.\nPick up the rodent by the scruff and anesthetize the rodent with a cocktail of ketamine and xylazine (80-100 mg/kg: 5-10 mg/kg, respectively) via intraperitoneal injection (combine 1.0 mL of ketamine with 0.5 mL of xylazine as a final concentration).\n\tNOTE: Use a 1 mL of syringe with a 23-25G needle. Inject approximately 0.2 mL per 100 g body weight of the rat for 30 min of anesthesia.\nPerform the toe pinch to verify pain sensation and to corroborate proper anesthesia. A reaction to deep toe pinch (by withdrawal of hind limb) indicates insufficient anesthesia.\n2. Surgical setup\nSterilize all equipment in an autoclave or hot glass bead sterilizer prior to beginning surgery. Clean the surgical area with 70% ethanol.\nUse latex gloves and lab coat before starting the procedure.\nPlace a sterile surgical drape on the clean bench (Figure 1A).\nSterilize micro-scissors and an otoscope prior to the surgery to minimize ear infection (Figure 1B).\nPlace the micro-scissors and otoscope in the sterile area.\nPlace the rodent in the surgical field and in alignment with the surgeon.\nProceed with the surgical induction of CHL.",
    "3. Surgical induction of conductive hearing loss\nPlace the tail and the head of the rodent aligned in a prone position, head closest to the surgeon.\nVisualize the left and right ear of the rodent under otoscope to ensure healthy tympanic membrane (Figure 2a). Evaluate both the right and left ear of every rodent to verify the healthy condition prior to the CHL induction.\nGrab the ear helix and extend the external auditory canal (i.e., ear canal, external auditory meatus, herein auditory canal) to cause the inside to become obscured and blackened by depth. Here, the auditory canal is made perpendicular to the surface of the TM.\n\tNOTE: Ensure the auditory cannel is directly parallel now and the TM forms a right angle with the axis of insertion of the micro-scissors. It will be visualized as a black tube without light. Sometimes the auditory canal needs to be tilted at a slight angle, approximately 15° to the planar surface of the skull. This ensures the surgeon hand is perpendicular to the surface of the TM.\nIntroduce the micro-scissors in the center of the auditory canal paying attention not to skim or nick the tissue of the auditory canal and proceed slightly, approximately ≈5 mm from the center of obscurity, thrusting forward gently through the center of the TM.",
    "NOTE: TM puncture can be confirmed by a pop sound when the micro-scissor tips puncture the TM. The popping sound can be heard at approximately ≈ 2 min 52 s in the video. This is not a scissor sound; this is a TM puncture sound. As measured post-analysis, the \"pop\" is approximately ≈ 20 dB SPL greater than background sound as recorded by a high frequency microphone. There is no need to verify the \"pop\" sound to this extent, otoscope visualization is sufficient. The investigator may need to practice ensuring a 'pop' is heard during each CHL procedure.\nImmediately open the spring-loaded micro-scissors and rotate three times after puncturing the TM to ensure displacement of the head of the malleus away from the TM (only if malleus displacement is desired).\nRemove the micro-scissors and place the rodent under the otoscope for visualization.\n\tNOTE: It is important to note that no significant bleeding should occur after the surgical procedure. Euthanize the rodent and do not proceed to behavioral assessment if bleeding occurs.\nInduce bilateral CHL by proceeding as above in the opposite ear.\n4. Otoscope visualization\nConfirm a successful CHL surgery with an otoscope using a small diameter speculum to visualize the rodent middle ear.\nEvaluate every rodent prior to and after the CHL surgical procedure underneath the otoscope. Ensure confirmation of normal TM (Figure 2a) and damaged TM after CHL induction (Figure 2b).\nPost-operative care for the rodent\nPlace the rodent in home cage under a warm lamp.\nObserve the rodent post-CHL induction until the rodent rights itself.\nInject the rodent with glucose (dextrose/saline) serum to recover consciousness and place rodent in homecage for recovery.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a 23G needle with a 10 mL syringe to inject 5 mL of saline after CHL surgery.",
    "Inject the rodent via intramuscular with anti-bacterial Enrofloxacin 0.05 mg/kg twice during the 24 h recovery period.\nObserve the rodent regularly for pain behavior or symptoms after surgery.\n5. Behavioral assessment (validation of CHL induction) - clap startle response\nCorroborate CHL (after otoscope confirmation) 24 h post-surgery with the behavioral assessment consisting of the clap-startle-test.\nPlace the CHL induced rat next to a normal rat in two separate adjoining cages.\nPlace the rodents in a silent room.\nStand approximately 0.5 m away from the rodents and proceed to clap in equally spaced durations a number of times (5 claps were chosen and spaced over 1 second).\n\tNOTE: The clap startle produced by the hand clap measured ≈ 40 dB SPL greater than background sound as recorded by a high frequency microphone.\nSubscription Required.
