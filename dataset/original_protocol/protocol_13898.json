    "1. Preparation of phosphate buffer saline (PBS)\nNOTE: PBS was used throughout this study as the described assays did not require the addition of calcium. It is important to note that when adding calcium, often utilized to re-calcify citrated blood products, PBS should be avoided as calcium is known to precipitate in phosphate buffers.\nMake a 0.01 M, pH 7.4 PBS buffer by mixing 137 mM sodium chloride, 1.8 mM potassium phosphate monobasic, 10 mM sodium phosphate dibasic and 2.7 mM potassium chloride in DI water.\nVerify buffer pH using a pH probe and adjust the pH using sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid as needed.\nUse this PBS for preparation of fibrinogen and clotting assays (unless otherwise specified).\n\tNOTE: Buffer is suggested to reconstitute fibrinogen powder since rehydration in DI water can result in fibrinogen precipitation even at 37 °C.\n2. Preparation and storage of proteins\nNOTE: Throughout the protocol the protein stock concentrations are prepared at different concentrations for turbidity and TEG to allow for the consistent ratio of salt, DI water, PBS and other residual factors in the final clotting solutions.\nPreparation and storage of fibrinogen",
    "NOTE: Contaminants in commercially available fibrinogen include a significant amount of factor XIII, residual amounts of other clotting factors, storage buffer and salts. In the presence of calcium, factor XIII is known to crosslink the fibrin clot network. This effect contributes to a tightened clot structure and enhanced clot strength affecting fibrin characterization. Commercially available activity kits can be used to determine active factor XIIIa levels. To minimize variability caused by factor XIIIa, experiments should be designed with the exclusion of calcium or additional steps to remove factor XIIIa should be incorporated into this protocol. In addition, protein storage salt and buffer type should be assessed and if necessary dialysis can be carried out to transfer to a preferred assay working buffer.\n\t\nWeigh and aliquot lyophilized fibrinogen powder (bovine or human) in 2 mL tubes at 20 mg of protein per tube and store aliquots at -20 °C for up to 6 months.\nAllow fibrinogen aliquot to acclimate to RT (room temperature) for 10 minutes on the day of the experiment. Reconstitute fibrinogen by adding 600 µL of PBS to the aliquot 20 min prior to use.\nTake 10 µL of fibrinogen and dilute it with 190 µL of PBS in a UV transparent 96-well plate or a cuvette. Determine fibrinogen concentration by taking absorbance at 280 nm via a commercial spectrometer and its software.\nCalculate fibrinogen concentration (mg/mL) using Beer’s law. Prepare 12 mg/mL (for turbidity assays) and 3.2 mg/mL (for TEG) fibrinogen stock solutions by further dilution with PBS (unless otherwise specified).\n\t\tNOTE: Fibrinogen concentration determination (mg/mL) by Beer’s law:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61519/61519eq1v2.jpg",
    "Molar extinction coefficient: ɛ = 513,400 L mol-1 cm-1 at 280 nm; Pathlength (L); Dilution factor (D); Molecular Weight (MW) = 340,000 Da. ɛ is derived by multiplying E0.1% = 1.51 (280 nm) (extinction coefficient, given by the supplier) with MW.\nPreparation and storage of thrombin\n\t\nReconstitute lyophilized thrombin (bovine or human, 1000 U stock) in 200 µL of deionized (DI) water to make 200 µL of 5000 U/mL thrombin stock solution.\nMake 5 µL (20 U/tube) aliquots of the solution and keep aliquots frozen at −20 °C.\nThaw thrombin aliquots at RT for 15 min on the day of experiment and make thrombin working solution by diluting it to 20 U/mL for turbidity assays and 18 U/mL for TEG with DI water (unless otherwise specified).\n\t\tNOTE: Precautions should be taken to maintain enzyme activity which can be accomplished by maintaining enzymes on ice during thawing and use; however, no reduction in thrombin activity was observed when utilized directly after thawing at RT.\n3. Turbidity\nUse any commercially available spectrometer that has an absorbance range of 350 - 700 nm and a corresponding software to monitor clot turbidity over time (see Table of Materials).\nTurn on the spectrometer and open the corresponding analysis software.\nSelect plate 1 and open plate settings tab. Click ABS mode and Kinetic to monitor a dynamic absorbance reading over time.\nSelect 550 nm (or any value in the range of 350 – 700 nm) in the wavelength tab and adjust the total run time to be 60 min with an interval of 30 s in the timing tab. Select wells of interest for reading by highlighting the wells. Adjust other settings if needed.",
    "NOTE: Selecting a wavelength at the lower end of the range (around 350 nm) brings a better sensitivity but absorbance might also exceed the detection limit of the spectrometer. The most commonly utilized wavelength for turbidity measurement is 405 nm in literature; however, this protocol uses 550 nm to ensure the dynamic turbidity values are within the detection limit for all experiments. The selected reading interval should be as short as possible to achieve the highest level of assay sensitivity. This will depend upon the spectrometer and number of wells being read during a given assay.\nTake a UV transparent 96-well plate. Pipette 140 µL PBS in a well that is selected for reading. Add and mix 10 µL of thrombin (20 U/mL) in the well.\n\tNOTE: Do not use high binding assay plates to minimize nonspecific protein binding to the well surface. This could affect protein dispersion in the solution and result in high assay variability.\nInitiate clotting immediately by adding 50 µL of fibrinogen (12 mg/mL) in the well to obtain a 200 µL clotting solution with a final concentration of 3 mg/mL fibrinogen and 1 U/mL thrombin. Mix the contents in the well by pipetting up and down five times taking care to avoid the creation of bubbles in the solution as they will impact absorbance by scattering light.\n\tNOTE: Use a multichannel pipette when running multiple clot samples on the same plate at the same time. Record time differences across wells and the time period prior to the first read by the instrument to offset clotting times.\nPlace the 96-well plate in the holder and click Start in the software to start turbidity reading at RT.",
    "NOTE: If carrying out the assay at an elevated temperature then the spectrometer, plate, and reagents must all be maintained at the desired temperature prior to clot initiation.\nOnce completed, retrieve the turbidity data and obtain a turbidity tracing curve by plotting absorbance change over time in a plotting software.\nDerive TurbMax (maximum turbidity indicative of fibrin fiber thickness and fibrin network density) by taking the max absorbance value of the curve over time.\n\tNOTE: Fibrin fiber mass/length ratio can be calculated from turbidity values using the equation provided in the following manuscript8.\nCalculate 90% maximum turbidity by multiplying TurbMax by 90%. Derive TurbTime by computing time from clot initiation to 90% maximum turbidity.\n\tNOTE: The time to 90% maximum turbidity is a more reliable metric than time to absolute maximum turbidity as it better represents clot time by eliminating the highly variable final clot formation period. Additional clotting parameters such as clot onset time (time from start of test to when absorbance starts to increase), and clot formation rate (Vmax, the largest slope of the linear region in the turbidity tracing curve) can also be extracted from the turbidity tracings.\n4. Thromboelastography (TEG)\nTurn on the thromboelastograph analyzer and wait for the temperature to stabilize at 37 °C.\nOpen TEG - software. Once logged in, create an experiment name under the ID section.\nConduct an e-test for all channels by following the on-screen software prompts. Place the lever back to the load position once all checks are complete.\n\tNOTE: A TEG e-test is required and should be conducted every time when using the instrument. TEG coagulation control assays (using TEG level 1 and level 2 controls) are required at the regular manufacturer suggested intervals when utilized for clinical samples.",
    "Click the TEG tab, input sample information for channels that will be used. Place a clear uncoated TEG cup in its corresponding channel. Slide the carrier up to the top and press the cup bottom 5-times to affix the pin to the torsion rod. Lower the carrier and press the cup downward into the carrier base until it “clicks”.\nPipette 20 µL of thrombin solution (18 U/mL) into the TEG cup. Initiate clotting immediately by adding 340 µL of fibrinogen (3.2 mg/mL) into the TEG cup to obtain a 360 µL clotting solution with a final concentration of 3 mg/mL fibrinogen and 1 U/mL thrombin in the cup. Mix the contents by pipetting up and down five times.\n\tNOTE: Potential clotting factors or other components of interest should be added during this step being careful to always maintain a final volume of 360 µL in the TEG cup.\nSlide the cup loaded carrier up, move the lever to the read position and click Start in the software to initiate the TEG reading.\nOnce TEG is completed (after about an hour), retrieve TEG parameters and obtain a TEG tracing curve by plotting amplitude over time in a plotting software.\nCollect MA as TEGMax (maximum amplitude is indicative of clot strength) and TMA as TEGTime (time to maximum amplitude) from the software.",
    "NOTE: MA is calculated by the software as the maximum amplitude at the time at which the amplitude has less than a 5% deviation over a 3-minute period of time. TMA is determined as the time from the maximum thrombus generation rate (near the split point) to the MA. Other parameters might also be useful to assess when performing the clot analysis. Some examples of these parameters include: R-time (the time from start of test to when amplitude reaches 2 mm), K (the time from the end of R to when amplitude reaches 20 mm), alpha (slope of line between R and K), and CLT (clot lysis time).\n5. Fibrin characterization under different clotting conditions\nNOTE: Perform fibrin characterization experiments by modulating a specific variable in the clotting solutions such as: fibrinogen and thrombin concentrations, ionic strength, pH, and total protein concentrations. Experimental preparations with these example variables are described in this section; however, other clotting factors and conditions of interest can be substituted as well. Carefully select a suitable buffer system taking into consideration each unique assay requirements. For turbidity and TEG assays, include a buffer only control to ensure an accurate background subtraction while analyzing the effect of these variables.\nVarying fibrinogen concentration (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 mg/mL)\n\t\nAdjust step 2.1.4 to prepare the fibrinogen stock at different concentrations (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 mg/mL for turbidity assays and 1.1, 2.1, 3.2, 4.2, 5.3 mg/mL for TEG).\nAdjust step 3.6 to “add 50 µL fibrinogen (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 mg/mL) into multiple wells of the 96 well-plate” for turbidity assays.\nAdjust step 4.5 to “add 340 µL fibrinogen (1.1, 2.1, 3.2, 4.2, 5.3 mg/mL) into clear TEG cups” for TEG.\nVarying thrombin concentration (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2.5, 5, 10 U/mL)",
