    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      The present protocol describes the procedure for a conventional RT-PCR\n      reaction with locally produced enzymes (Mendoza-Rojas et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) coupled to CRISPR/Cas12a detection using a fluorescence microplate\n      reader, or direct fluorescence visualization (Alcántara et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). This protocol is intended to be used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.\n      However, the described methodology could be set up as a base protocol for\n      molecular detection of nucleic acid molecules (RNA/DNA) of any other\n      pathogen or microorganism of interest.\n    \nNote: In this protocol, we describe RT-PCR\n      and CRISPR/Cas recipes for 32 reactions, to fit in the BentoLab portable\n      system. All the examples in the article correspond to a 32 reactions\n      workflow (28 samples + controls). Scale the required volume of each\n      reagent depending on the total number of samples to test or if a 96-well\n      thermocycler is available.\n    \nSample RNA extraction\n      This protocol has been validated with nasopharyngeal swab samples. Use\n      your locally approved viral RNA extraction or other approved commercial\n      alternative kits. Here, the viral RNA material was extracted using the\n      QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN).\n    \n        To perform RNA extraction, 200 μL of sample or negative extraction\n        control (NEC) was used according to the manufacturer protocol (https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=c80685c0-4103-49ea-aa72-8989420e3018&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=c80685c0-4103-49ea-aa72-8989420e3018&lang=en]). Proceed with the Spin protocol or Vacuum protocol depending on\n        vacuum pump and manifold availability.\n      \nElute RNA with 100 μL of nuclease-free water.\nNote: A negative extraction control (NEC)\n      should be included during the RNA extraction step to evaluate\n      contamination during sample handling. A NEC could be a pool of verified\n      negative patient samples, commercial alternatives (i.e., human DNA in\n      stabilizing synthetic matrix, such as the one available in the HDPCRTM\n      SARS-CoV-2 assay (ChromaCode)), or even molecular-grade nuclease-free\n      water.\n    \nOne-step RT-PCR\nTiming: two hours from reaction\n      preparation to results",
    "This protocol was standardized to amplify two gene SARS-CoV-2 targets, at\n      the 5′- and 3′-end of the genome, as well as a region of the RNAseP human\n      gene as RNA extraction control using a one-step RT-PCR reaction. Examples\n      used M-MLV reverse transcriptase (RT) and Taq DNA polymerase produced in\n      the laboratory. Commercial enzymes can be used as an alternative.\n    \nAlternatives: The following\n      commercial kits have been evaluated in replacement of the enzymes\n      mentioned here, M-MLV reverse transcriptase and/or Taq-polymerase.\n      Commercial kits can be used as one- or two-step RT-PCR reactions without\n      interfering with the CRISPR/Cas detection assay. For one-step reactions we\n      tested the 2× One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix (Cat. No. 28113, Norgen\n      Biotek). For two-step reactions we tested RevertAid First Strand cDNA\n      Synthesis Kit (Cat. No. K1622, ThermoFisher) coupled with DreamTaq Green\n      PCR Master Mix (2×) (Cat. No. K1081, ThermoFisher) or Taq DNA\n      polymerase with Standard Taq Buffer (Cat. No. M0273S, NEB). Other\n      commercial enzymes are expected to be suitable for nucleic acid\n      amplification followed by detection with the proposed CRISPR/Cas system\n      described in this protocol.\n    \n      The one-step RT-PCR reaction produces first a DNA copy (cDNA) of the\n      target RNA molecules extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva\n      samples. After this reverse transcription step, the cDNA template is\n      amplified by the Taq DNA polymerase to generate dsDNA copies of the target\n      region of interest (Álvarez-Fernández, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2];\n      Chaubal et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6];\n      Graham et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9];\n      Mahony et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\n    \nNote: Each gene target is amplified\n      individually by RT-PCR.\n    \n        Master mix preparation\n        \nCritical: It is strongly\n          recommended to prepare the master mix in a different laboratory area\n          from where clinical samples are manipulated or where the samples are\n          analyzed. Amplicon contamination can severely compromise your results.\n          Follow the general recommendations for molecular analysis of clinical\n          samples (WHO. World Health Organization. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20])",
    "Pause point: Thaw all reagents\n          on ice, while pre-heating a thermoblock or thermocycler at 50°C.\n        \n            Prepare the master mix according to the following recipe (i.e.,\n            scale the required volume of each reagent depending on the total\n            number of samples to test). Here we work with 33 reactions\n            corresponding to a final volume of 660 μL considering a 2 μL sample\n            to be analyzed and a total volume of 20 μL for each reaction.\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_1145_9.csv\nNote: It is recommended to prepare\n              1-2 additional reactions due to some volume loss by pipetting.\n            \nCritical: We strongly\n              recommend preparing and maintaining the master mix on ice (or use\n              an IsoFreeze® PCR rack) to avoid unspecific product amplification\n              (i.e., primer dimerization) (Graham et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\n            \nMix by gently vortexing and spin down for few seconds.\n            Dispense 18 μL in PCR tubes (0.2 mL). Individual tubes or PCR strips\n            can be used.\n          \n            Securely close all tubes and spin down the tubes for few seconds.\n          \nPlace the tubes on ice (or using an IsoFreeze® PCR rack)\nCritical: To avoid amplicon\n      contamination, the addition of RNA samples extracted from clinical samples\n      should be performed in a dedicated laboratory area, pipette set, and BSL2\n      hood. This area should be restricted to any incoming amplified material.\n      Gloves and coats should also be dedicated to this area.\n    \n        Add 2 μL of extracted RNA samples to each reaction (step 2). To evaluate\n        potential reaction contamination and reaction performance, a no template\n        control (NTC), a NEC (step 1), and a positive control should be included\n        in each assay, respectively.\n      \nNote: For the NTC, nuclease-free water\n      must be added to the respective PCR tube. For the positive control,\n      genomic RNA, RNA standards (e.g., as the ones available in the BEI\n      Resources catalogue (https://www.beiresources.org/[href=https://www.beiresources.org/])) or sample pools from certified positive samples for SARS-CoV-2 can be",
    "used.\n    \n        Insert the tubes or strips into the thermocycler from the BentoLab\n        system (alternative thermocyclers can be used instead) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1145-Fig1.jpg\n              Figure 1. Recommended plate layout for 32 reactions to be\n              processed in the BentoLab\n            \nCritical: Thermocyclers must be in a\n      dedicated area. Ensure that all tubes or strips are sealed properly to\n      avoid cross-contamination between samples and to protect samples from\n      evaporation.\n    \nRun the following RT-PCR program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1145_10.csv\nNote: Total run time 1:40 hours\n    \nPause point: Meanwhile the\n      CRISPR/Cas reaction can be prepared (see CRISPR/Cas reaction below).\n    \n        Store the RT-PCR products at 4°C for short term or at −20°C for mid/long\n        term until the CRISPR/Cas detection assay is performed.\n      \nNote: Optional, the RT-PCR product can be\n      visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. RT-PCR products are expected to\n      be 168 bp for the ORF1ab target, 131 bp for the N target, and 175 bp for\n      the RNAseP target (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). If RT-PCR product bands\n      are not visible, see\n      troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section –\n      problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1145-Fig2.jpg\n          Figure 2. RT-PCR products from positive and negative controls for\n          ORF1ab, N and RNAseP targets\n        \n          The amplification products were run on a 5% agarose gel at 70 V for\n          60 min. AmpliSize Molecular Ruler (Cat. No. 1708200, Bio-Rad) was used\n          as ladder. Products were visualized using SafeGreen (Cat. No. G108-G,\n          abm) in the loading buffer TriTrack DNA loading dye 6× (Cat.\n          No. R1161, ThermoFisher).\n        \nCRISPR/Cas12a-mediated detection\nTiming: 35 minutes from reaction\n      preparation to results\n    \n      This protocol was standardized to detect two loci at the 5′- and\n      3′-end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, respectively, and a region of the RNAseP\n      human gene. The following crRNA sequences were used for protocol\n      standardization and validation:\n    \ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1145_11.csv\n      The LbCas12a enzyme detects a specific DNA sequence by recognizing the",
    "base pairing between crRNA and the target (Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Swarts et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). Upon recognition of the\n      target DNA, Cas12a undergoes structural changes in its RuvC active site\n      that result in an unspecific trans-cleavage activity on any available\n      single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule in the vicinity (Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Li et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). This has been adapted for\n      in vitro detection of a target DNA of interest for diagnostic\n      proofs of concept (Broughton et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4];\n      Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). The CRISPR/Cas12a assay uses a\n      double-labeled reporter probe (i.e., with a fluorophore and quencher) that\n      is cleaved upon Cas12a trans-activity only in the presence of the specific\n      target DNA in the reaction, thereby generating a fluorescent signal that\n      can be detected with a fluorescence plate reader or by direct\n      visualization using a transilluminator (Bonini et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Kumar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\n    \nNote: The following example concentrations\n      and volumes are indicated for the previous 32 RT-PCR reactions for the\n      ORF1ab target that include 28 unknown samples, two positive controls and\n      two no template controls (NTC). Each target RT-PCR product (ORF1ab, N, and\n      RNaseP) is evaluated individually using the CRISPR/Cas12a assay. An Excel\n      template (Mendeley Data:\n      https://doi.org/10.17632/8m8z37v8xz.1[href=https://doi.org/10.17632/8m8z37v8xz.1]\n      Reaction recipe template) is provided to calculate the necessary volume of\n      the required reagents for crRNA re-folding and Cas12a master mix\n      preparation.\n    \nNote: All buffers required in this segment\n      must be prepared in advance.\n    \nThaw all reagents on ice\nPause point: Pre-heating a\n      thermoblock at 65°C.\n    \n        crRNA re-folding\n        \n            Prepare the working stock by diluting the crRNA stock in\n            nuclease-free water to get a final concentration of 1.3 μM (see\n            before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], Step 6I, for crRNA\n            production).\n          \nMix gently by vortexing or tapping, and spin briefly.\nIncubate at 65°C for 10 min.\nCool at 25°C for 10 min.",
