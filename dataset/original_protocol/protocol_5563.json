    "Cultivation of cyanobacteriaTo make a pre-culture, transfer a small amount (approximately the size of a rice grain) of cyanobacterial cells from a plate culture into 10 ml of liquid medium. Grow the pre-culture in an aquarium (see Equipment, also see Figure 1) for 24 h with a constant supply of 3% (v/v) CO2 balanced with air. Use A+ medium and BG11 medium to grow Synechococcus 7002 and Synechocystis 6803, respectively.Transfer 1 ml of the culture into a plastic cuvette with a 1 cm light path length, and measure the optical density at 730 nm (OD730) using a spectrophotometer. If the value was higher than 0.8, make appropriate dilutions until the value falls between 0.1 and 0.8. Then calculate the OD730 value of the undiluted culture.Dilute the pre-culture with fresh media to achieve OD730 of 0.05 in the volume of 10 ml. Grow the culture until OD730 reaches approximately 1. At this stage, the cells are in the late exponential growth phase.Notes: Typically, three independent cultures are prepared as biological replicates for each condition. Examples of conditions are distinct genotypes (e.g., a wild-type strain, a mutant strain), nutrient regimens (e.g., deprivation of a micro/macro nutrient), and environmental setups (e.g., light intensity, temperature, pH). Durations needed for Synechococcus 7002 and Synechocystis 6803 cultures to reach OD730 of 1 from OD730 of 0.05 depend on conditions, but typically ~20 h and ~40 h, respectively, in the culture setups described in this protocol. The culture volume may be adjusted depending on needs. We tested up to 1 L in a 2-L flask and down to 200 μl in a 96-well plate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171227/20171227021242_9701.jpgFigure 1.",
    "A schematic illustration of the procedure for cultivation, permeabilization, and enzyme activity assays of a 10-ml cyanobacterial culturePermeabilization of cyanobacterial cellsPerform the following procedure for each of the biological replicates prepared in Procedure A.Notes: See Note a in Procedure AAll steps are carried out on ice.See Figure 1. Prepare the following solutions and store on ice until use:The B-PERTM reagent containing protease inhibitors: add 40 µl of the 25x cOmplete protease inhibitor solution (see Recipes) to 1 ml B-PERTM reagent.A 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors: add 20 µl of the 25x cOmplete protease inhibitor solution to 0.5 ml of a Tris-HCl buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5).Transfer the 10-ml culture, prepared in Step A3, to a 15 ml Falcon tube, and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant. Note: When a larger culture volume is used (e.g., 1 L), centrifuge bottles with a larger capacity (≥ 200 ml) would be suitable for harvesting cells. When a 96-well plate is used for cultivation, the plate can be directly centrifuged in a multi-well plate centrifuge.Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of the B-PERTM reagent containing protease inhibitors, prepared in Step B1a, by pipetting up and down until the cell suspension is homogenous.* Transfer the resuspension into a fresh 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and shake gently for 10 min in ice using an orbital shaking platform at 100 rpm. Pellet the permeabilized cyanobacterial cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.* *Note: The resuspension is pipetted up and down slowly five to eight times. Dependent on the cyanobacterial species at hand, a yellowish color might appear in the supernatant, which is not a concern.",
    "The yellowish color is more apparent in Synechocystis 6803 compared to Synechococcus 7002 cellsResuspend the pellet containing permeabilized cyanobacterial cells in 500 µl of the Tris-HCl buffer containing protease inhibitors, prepared in Step B1b. Immediately use this resuspension for enzymatic assays or store at -20 °C for later use. See Figure 2 for a visual example of how treated cells look in comparison to untreated cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171227/20171227021732_7057.jpgFigure 2. Treated and untreated cyanobacterial cellsDetermination of chlorophyll a concentrationsPerform the following procedure for each of the biological replicates prepared in Procedure A.Briefly invert the permeabilized cyanobacterial cells prepared in Step B6 and transfer 100 μl in a 1.5-ml screw cap microcentrifuge tube. Note: Permeabilized cells sediment quickly, so it is important to invert the tube once or twice before taking out the indicated volume.Add 900 μl of 96% (v/v) ethanol and close the cap. Incubate the tube at 90 °C for 5 min with shaking at 700 rpm in a thermomixer. Cool down the tube on ice for 2 min. Note: Cooling is important because the microtube becomes too hot to handle.Spin down the cell debris at 10,000 x g for 10 min in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a 1-cm light path cuvette. Measure the absorbance at 664 nm (A664) and 648 nm (A648) using a spectrophotometer. Note: Measurements are performed typically within 5 min following the centrifugation step. Calculate the chlorophyll a concentration as follows: Chlorophyll a (μg ml-1) = (13.36 x A664 - 5.19 x A648) x 10 (Lichtenthaler and Buschmann, 2001), wherein the multiplication factor of 10 is included to account for the dilution effect.",
    "Determination of enzymatic activities Note: There are 3 biological replicates for each condition (see Note a in Procedure A); therefore, 9 wells are used for each condition (Steps D1a, D1c, D2a).  Rubisco activity assayTransfer 50 µl of the permeabilized cells prepared in B6 into a well in a 96-well plate. Perform this for each biological replicate.Note: Permeabilized cells sediment quickly, so it is important to invert the tube once or twice before taking out the indicated volume.Add 148 µl of buffer A (see Recipes) and 2 µl of 1 M NaHCO3 into each well containing the permeabilized cells and mix gently by pipetting up and down. Incubate on ice for 10 min to activate Rubisco by full carbamylation of the active site. Add 10 µl of the preincubated permeabilized cell preparation made in Step D1a to a well in a fresh 96-well plate. Prepare three technical replicates for each biological replicate. Add 240 µl of the Rubisco assay buffer (see Recipes) to each technical replicate and mix gently by pipetting up and down three times.Monitor the rate of NADH oxidation at a wavelength of 340 nm for 30 min using a microplate reader at 30 °C.G6PDH activity assayTransfer 10 µl of the permeabilized cells prepared in B6 into a well in a 96-well plate. Prepare three technical replicates.Add 200 μl of a G6PDH assay buffer (see Recipes) to each technical replicate. Mix gently by pipetting up and down three times.Monitor the rate of formation of NADPH at a wavelength of 340 nm immediately after the addition of the assay buffer for 30 min using a plate reader at 30 °C."
