    "1. Blunt Dissection: Enucleation of the mouse eye in unfixed specimens\nPull apart the eyelids to improve exposure and access to the posterior globe (eyeball) surface. \nPlace a curved dressing forcep behind (under) the globe in the orbit (eye socket). The Mahajan Sharptip dressing forcep is a custom instrument with pointed tips to make this step easier (see materials and reagents table).\nClose the forcep and grasp the orbital connective tissue and optic nerve behind the globe while being careful to avoid squeezing the globe.\nGently pull the forcep upward and pluck the eyeball from the orbit. The white thread-like tissue is the optic nerve.\nPlace the eye in PBS. Using a 30-gauge needle, make a single puncture wound immediately posterior to the limbus by inserting the needle 1-2 mm into the eyeball. This allows fixatives, such as glutaraldehyde, that are otherwise unable to penetrate the eye tissue, to directly enter the eye.  Creation of this puncture wound may not be necessary if a fixative, such as paraformaldehyde or alcohol, is capable of diffusing into ocular tissues of interest.\nPlace the entire eye immediately into fixative for immersion fixation.\n2. Sharp Dissection: Enucleation of the mouse eye following perfusion fixation\nUse a curved colibri forcep to hold the eyelid away from the globe.\nOrient curved Westcott dissection scissors parallel to the globe, while aiming towards the back of the orbit.\nCut the fixed connective tissue that surrounds the globe from the inferior, medial, superior, and lateral sides.\nPlace the curved forcep behind the globe, grasp the connective tissue without pressing on the globe, and pull forward to enucleate the eye.  Since the orbital connective tissue is stiff from perfusion fixation, additional cutting of orbital tissues may be necessary to completely release the globe.\n3. Fixation and Packaging",
    "Shipping of fixed tissues must follow your institutional and postal service requirements including appropriate labels and packaging. The following protocol is an example of shipping a non-infectious biological sample at ambient temperature.  This requires 3 layers of packaging but no class A/B biological substance or liquid nitrogen labels.\nPlace the eye into a 5-mL glass scintillation vial with at least 3-mL fixative, or post-fixative buffer if fixation is short.  Write the tracking number on the lid of the vial and seal it with Parafilm.\nPlace scintillation vials into a biological sample approved shipping container.  In our institute, for example, approved containers require three layers: a sealed container in which the sample is placed, an absorbent middle layer, and a protective outer layer.  \nPlace the container into a bubble-wrap package and then into an approved laboratory shipping container along with appropriate documentation.\n4. Representative Results\nHistological examination of eyes can be performed by a variety of methods including Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, enzymatic expression detection, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Following immersion fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, tissue was embedded in paraffin and sectioned on a microtome. In high-throughput phenotyping, we analyze pupil-optic nerve sections that sample all tissue types in the eye (Figure 1). Sections of tissue were also examined for lacZ expression (Figure 2), transmission electron microscopy of cellular organelles (Figure 3), and expression of specific molecules with antibodies (Figure 4).",
    "In our phenotype screening method, it was not important to maintain orientation of the eye with respect to the nasal (medial canthus) and temporal (lateral canthus) sides. There are at least two options if eye orientation is necessary. After enucleation, we have applied light cautery to the temporal cornea at the three o’clock position with a handheld cautery device. The lesion is obvious on histology and does not get lost during processing like histological inks.  The downside is that cautery damages the cornea, which may be a critical tissue for examination. The other option requires a skilled anatomist that can identify the extraocular muscle insertions. Under a stereomicroscope, identification of the inferior and superior oblique muscle insertion marks the inferior and superior and aspect of the globe.3 With either orientation method, it is important to track the specimen as a right or left eye. Together, this will allow exact globe orientation prior to sectioning.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3184/3184fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

A higher magnification view of the normal retina shows its laminar structure: RGC, retinal ganglion cells; IPL, inner plexiform layer; INL, inner nuclear layer; OPL, outer plexiform layer; ONL, outer nuclear layer (photoreceptor cell)(arrow); IS, photoreceptor inner segments (arrow head); OS, photoreceptor outer segments; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; C, choroid. (green scale bar = 50 microns) C.  Compared to the normal retina, this specimen is thinner due to photoreceptor degeneration. The ONL, IS, and OS are completely absent (arrow).

Eyes were enucleated by blunt dissection and immersed in 1 mg/ml X-gal solution (5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NP40, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) overnight at 37°C. Eyes were fixed in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes and sectioned on a microtome. X-gal product (blue) labels: A.

After blunt dissection and creation of a puncture wound, eyes were immersion fixed in 2.5% Paraformaldehyde/ 2.5% Glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer.  Eyes were secondarily fixed in 1% osmium textroxide, gradually dehydrated, and embedded in Spurr’s resin.  Tissue was sectioned at 90 nm and placed onto copper slot grids covered in Formvar and imaged using a transmission electron microscope. The micrograph shows, photoreceptor outer segments of the neurosensory retina, melanosomes (M) within the retinal pigment epithelium, and Bruch’s membrane. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3184/3184fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
