    "Prepare droplet formationOn the evening before the experiment, prepare pre-cultures of the cells to be sorted by inoculating them into ~5 ml LB containing the appropriate antibiotic (or another suitable medium) and incubate them at 37 °C for 12-18 h in a shaking incubator. Alternatively, the protocol can also be started from glycerol stocks (stored at -80 °C), for example, 15% (v/v) glycerol stocks prepared by adding 420 μl of the overnight culture to 180 μl of 50% (v/v) glycerol.Connect the high-speed camera to an inverted microscope (via C-mount).Adjust the settings of the high-speed camera. Provide enough light so that the exposure time can be adjusted to the minimum (~50 µsec) and the frame rate to the maximum. Reducing the picture dimension also allows increasing the frame rate.Note: To observe the droplet formation well, the frequency of the frames should be higher than the frequency of droplet formation. We are typically working at ≥ 600 frames per second.Place the syringe pumps close to the microscope. In order to keep the tubing short and avoid gelation of the agarose in the tubing, the pump for the syringe with the aqueous solution should be as close as possible to the microscope stage. We used a lab jack to place it at the right height (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180704/20180704181638_5828.jpgFigure 2. Equipment setup for producing microfluidic droplets. A. Overview of the whole setup. B. Close-up view on the microscope stage.Adjust the diameters in the pumps: 10.3 mm for the 5 ml syringe (oil) and 1.46 mm for the 100 µl syringe (aqueous phase).Bend three steel couplers with pliers to introduce a 90° bend in their center.Fix the device on the microscope stage. Inspect the device with a 10x objective and focus on the flow focusing part.",
    "Cut three pieces of tubing (best with a tubing cutter): used for the oil inlet, the aqueous solution inlet, and the outlet respectively. The tubes for the inlets must be long enough to connect the syringes with the device. The one for the oil can be quite long (typically 40 cm in our case). The one for the aqueous solution should be as short as possible to avoid gelation of the agarose in the tube. In our case, it is ≤ 5 cm. The exact length will depend on your microscope setup. The outlet tube is about 9 cm.Note: As the used plasmids carry an antibiotic resistance gene, we perform this protocol without sterile technique. It is, however, to autoclave the tubing and the steel couplers, and to disinfect the syringes and the device with 70% ethanol.Connect each tubing to a bent steel coupler by hand (wearing gloves). Connect the exit tube to the device by hand (wearing gloves).Use scissors to make a small hole in the lid of a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubing. Cut the lid off and put it onto another open microcentrifuge tube. Put the exit tube through the small hole into the microcentrifuge tube, which will serve to collect the droplets. The hole in the lid prevents the outlet tubing from falling out. Fix the tube with adhesive tape on the microscope stage and cool it with a small resealable plastic bag full of ice.Prepare 5-10 ml solution of fluorinated oil (HFE-7500) with 0.5% 008-FluoroSurfactant by pipetting 0.5-1 ml of 5% 008-FluoroSurfactant in HFE-7500 to 4.5-9 ml HFE-7500. It can be kept for several months at room temperature. Protect the tube from light with aluminum foil.Fill the 5 ml syringe with the oil/surfactant. Remove air bubbles.",
    "Connect the tubing for the oil to the needle of the syringe and fill it completely with oil. Confirm that the oil comes out of the steel coupler (into a Kimwipes tissue) and no air bubbles are left in the tubing.Fix the 5 ml syringe with the oil on the pump.Connect the tubing with the oil to the device by inserting the steel coupler into the oil inlet of the device.Prepare 1-2 ml 2% (w/v) agarose in your medium of choice (M63 in our case), including the appropriate antibiotic. The easiest way to do this is to weigh ~20 mg agarose into a microcentrifuge tube and add the correct amount of medium (1 ml in the case of 20 mg). Melt the agarose by incubating it for at least 15 min in a thermoblock at 60 °C.Note: I do not use temperatures higher than 60 °C for melting the agarose to prevent potential cell death by elevated temperature in Step A22.Get bacterial cells from a fresh pre-culture or a glycerol stock. Spin them down (~3,000 x g, 5 min) and resuspend in the medium you are going to use in the experiment.Measure the absorbance at 600 nm of the cells with a spectrophotometer, nanodrop or plate reader.Calculate the number of cells to be added to get the desired loading of your beads with cells. This depends on the droplet size and follows a Poisson distribution (see Notes for a step by step example of the calculations).Prepare ~500 µl of cells at the calculated density in the medium.Add 100 µl of the melted agarose (2% (w/v)) to 100 µl of the cells resulting in an aqueous solution containing the cells and 1% (w/v) agarose.From now on, you should take care of keeping the agarose solution warm.",
    "Work fast to avoid gelation of the agarose and keep it warm with the pre-warmed (e.g., in a 60 °C incubator) hot/cold compress.Fill a 100 µl syringe with the aqueous agarose solution. Try to avoid air bubbles. It might be necessary to expel and taking the liquid up several times until there are no air bubbles left.Connect the tubing for the aqueous solution to the syringe. Fill the tubing completely with the aqueous solution. Check that the solution comes out of the steel coupler (into a Kimwipes tissue) and no air bubbles are left in the tubing.Fix the syringe on the pump. Put a pre-warmed (e.g., in a 60 °C incubator) hot/cold compress on to the syringe and the tubing to avoid gelation of the agarose.Connect the tubing with the aqueous solution to the device (via the steel coupler).Droplet formation and microcolony growthStart the pump for the oil. Use approximately 2,000 μl/h until you see oil entering the device (< 5 min).Start the pump for the aqueous solution. Use approximately 150 μl/h until you see droplets forming. Then slow down the flow rate to 80 μl/h. Wait until droplet formation is stable (< 5 min).Notes: These are flow rates that we are typically using. Device design and the composition of the aqueous phase influence the optimal flow rates. The chosen flow rates affect droplet size and frequency of droplet formation.Typical reasons for unstable droplet formations are: “jetting” – the aqueous phase goes beyond the flow focusing part of the device and forms irregular droplets (reduce the aqueous flow rate), the agarose has started solidifying into a gel (keep the syringe warmer), the device is blocked by some dust or the PDMS device delaminated from the glass slides around the channels or inlets (change device).",
    "Take some pictures of the droplets in the device, so that you can determine their size (see Notes 1-2).Let the device run until you have produced as many droplets as you want. From time to time replace the hot/cold compress with a warm one. Ensure that the syringes do not run out of liquid.Note: With these flow rates we typically have a frequency of around 340 Hz, i.e., we produce 1.2 x 106 droplets/h. Seventy-four percent of them will not contain any cell. Some beads will also be lost during the process.If you want multiple aliquots of the same sample (e.g., to test different incubation times), it is easier and more accurate to change the collection tube after a specific amount of time (e.g., 15 min for each aliquot) than later having to pipette aliquots of the emulsion. I suggest keeping one aliquot as a negative control without incubation.If you want to make a second sample, let the device run while preparing the second sample in a second 100 μl syringe (+ a fresh aqueous inlet and outlet tubing).Remove the exit tubing and the collection tube. The emulsion remaining in the tubing can be recovered by pushing air through it with a syringe.Turn off the pump for the aqueous solution and reduce the oil flow rate to about 200 μl/h. Replace the syringe and tubing for the aqueous phase. Increase the oil rate again to 2,000 μl/h and start the aqueous solution again at 150 μl/h until you have droplets and lower it to 80 μl/h. Keeping the oil running reduces the risk of blocking the device.Note: Occasionally, blocking can happen since some dust enters the device and blocks the flow-focusing part of the device.",
    "You can try to remove it by pushing the oil syringe by hand to flush it out of the device.Keep the emulsion samples on ice until all samples are ready.Remove as much fluorinated oil (bottom layer) as you can without losing emulsion. Collect the fluorinated oil in a separated tube for recycling.Note: The fluorinated oil with the surfactant can be recycled and re-used multiple times. Simply filter it through a 0.22 µm syringe filter.To prevent evaporation, I recommend overlaying the emulsion samples with a thin layer of mineral oil.Incubate the samples at 37 °C (or at the temperature of choice) in a thermoblock or incubator for the chosen amount of time without shaking. Keep the negative control sample on ice in a 4 °C fridge.Notes: The incubation time depends on the cells and medium. For the M63 medium, we incubate overnight, for LB medium 4-8 h is enough. The first time it might be worth making a time course by incubating aliquots for different amounts of time and analyzing them on the flow cytometer (see Figure 2 in Duarte et al., 2017).Growth in the emulsion is limited by the amount of medium provided in the droplet. A way to increase cell growth is to break the emulsion before incubation. The beads can then be incubated in ample growth medium and oxygen leading to higher cell density than when incubated in the emulsion. The disadvantage of this strategy is that all beads share the same medium. It is, for example, not possible to screen for cells that excrete a quorum sensing molecule that then activates a network in the cells from the same bead. The chemical would also enter neighboring beads, where the molecule is not produced.",
    "In this form of incubation, it is also more likely that some cells escape the beads and then grow outside the bead in the growth medium. These free bacteria can then decrease sorting purity and a filtering step where the beads are separated from the free bacteria might become necessary. After incubation, cool the emulsion on ice for at least 15 min. This is to solidify the gel beads.Recover gel beadsIf you would like to look at your droplets using (fluorescence) microscopy, you can pipette them onto a microscope slide.Pipette 500 µl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the emulsion layer.Add 20-50 μl 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctanol (PFO) to the emulsion.Shortly vortex (5 sec) the tube and briefly centrifuge (10 sec, 2,500 x g).The emulsion (white) should be gone now. If there is still some emulsion left, repeat the last two steps (i.e., add more PFO, vortex and centrifuge).You have now three phases in the tube. From bottom to top: fluorinated oil and PFO, PBS containing the beads and mineral oil (if added) (Figure 3). Transfer the PBS phase to a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube by pipetting. Try to get as much of it as possible without taking any oil. If you have also transferred some oil, transfer the PBS again into a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. The oil tends to stick to the tube walls.Note: Dispose of the mineral oil and the fluorinated oil containing the PFO separately as chemical waste.If you need to stain the cells (e.g., with Syto 9), you can do that now. If they are already fluorescent, you can proceed to the next step.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180701/20180701192058_5158.jpgFigure 3. Three phases after breaking the emulsionSort gel beadsTo prevent clogging of the FACS, filter the samples through a 50 μm CellTrics mesh into the 1.4 ml screw cap tubes.",
    "Using tweezers, place the 1.4 ml tubes with the samples into the 5 ml round-bottom tubes which will fit to the flow cytometer. Like this, you have a minimal sample volume that cannot be sorted at the bottom of the tube.Analyse/sort the beads on the flow cytometer. Many universities will have a facility to help you with this.Use a 100 μm nozzle and the laser and filters suitable for detecting the fluorescence of your cells (488 nm laser, 530/30 nm filter for GFP).The width of the sideward scatter (SSC-W) versus the height of the forward scatter (FSC-H) is the combination of scatter parameters that separates the beads best from other particles (free bacteria, agarose debris, dust) or electronic noise of the machine. Therefore, first gate all beads (with and without microcolonies) on the SSC-W – FSC-H dot-plot (Figure 4A). For separating beads with and without microcolonies, we use the SSC-H – FSC-H dot plot (Figure 4B).The thresholds on the FSC-H and SSC-H can be set so that particles smaller than the beads are not recorded.Measure your controls (beads not incubated, beads with WT cells…).On the fluorescence histogram (Figure 4C) or the FSC-H–fluorescence dot plot set the gate for the beads with the fluorescence of interest, for example the 5% of beads with the highest fluorescence.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180701/20180701192354_4341.jpgFigure 4. Gating strategy. A. Width of the sideward scatter (SSC-W) versus the height of the forward scatter (FSC-H) is the combination of scatter parameters that separates the beads best from other particles (free bacteria, agarose debris, dust) or electronic noise of the machine. Therefore, we first gate all beads (with and without microcolonies) on the SSC-W – FSC-H dot-plot. B. We then plot the gated beads in the SSC-H – FSC-H dot plot for gating the beads with microcolonies.",
    "The negative control should only contain the beads without microcolonies. C. We then plot the fluorescence of the beads containing microcolonies as histogram and set the gate for sorting, for example the 5% brightest beads.Sort them into a 1.5 ml tube containing 200 µl of LB medium.Note: The 50 µm agarose beads actually break open when sorted with the 100 µm nozzle. This is convenient for recovering the bacteria from the beads, as no additional agarose digest and/or melting has to be performed. If it is important for your experiments to keep the beads intact, they can be strengthened before the sorting, for example with a layer of polyacrylamide (Spencer et al., 2016).Plate the beads out on pre-warmed LB-agar plate (supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic) and incubate overnight at 37 °C. We typically plate out each sorted sample on two big LB-agar plates (14 cm Ø) and typically recover > 10x more colonies than the number of beads collected.The colonies from the plates can be individually picked or resuspended all together in medium using glass beads. The resuspended libraries can be stored as glycerol stocks (15% v/v) at -80 °C. Samples can be analyzed, e.g., by sequencing, (single cell) flow cytometry, plate reader experiments etc. The glycerol stocks can be used to start another round of this protocol."
