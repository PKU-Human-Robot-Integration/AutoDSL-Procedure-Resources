    "The iPSCs used for the present study were obtained from a commercial source. The cells were maintained with mTeSR medium on commercially available basement membrane matrix-coated plates (see Table of Materials). Table 1 contains all the medium compositions utilized in the study.\n1. Plating iPSCs for differentiation and inducing posterior primitive streak (PS)\nWash iPSCs on the membrane matrix-coated 6-well plate with 2 mL DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS using a pipette.\nAdd 1 mL of the commercially available cell detachment solution (see Table of Materials) to detach iPSCs and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 1 mL of mTeSR to iPSCs, and ensure cells have lifted off the plastic surface.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 3 min at room temperature (RT). Resuspend the cell pellet and count the cell number using a hemocytometer.\nSeed a range of cell densities onto a 24-well- or 6-well plate coated with membrane matrix and culture with mTeSR supplemented with 10 µM Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) (see Table of Materials). Culture them overnight in a 37 °C CO2 incubator.\n\tNOTE: To induce PS, the optimal concentration of CHIR99021 and the suitable cell densities vary from different iPSC lines. Seed a range of densities (e.g., 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, 2.4 * 103 single cells per square centimeter) and a range of concentration of CHIR99021 from 7 µM-12 µM. Initiate the differentiation of each density and each CHIR on the same day. Find the optimal concentration of CHIR99021 and the suitable cell densities in a 24-well plate and then expand the culture in 6-well plates. Here we provide a protocol based on a 6-well plate.\nNext day, aspirate the mTeSR and wash the cells with 2 mL of DPBS.",
    "Add 2 mL of stage I medium (stem-cell differentiation medium containing 8-12 µM CHIR99021) (Table 1), refer to as Day 0.\nCulture them in a 37 °C incubator for 4 days, refresh stage I medium every two days.\n2. Inducing nephrogenic intermediate mesoderm (IM)\nOn Day 4, remove the stage I medium and wash with 2 mL of DPBS.\nAdd 2 mL of stage II medium to the cells (stem-cell differentiation medium containing 200 ng/mL FGF9, 1 µg/mL Heparin, and 1 µM CHIR99021) (Table 1).\nCulture them in a 37 °C incubator, and refresh the medium every 2 days until Day 7.\n3. Generating kidney organoids in suspension culture\nNOTE: During the observation period from Day 0 to Day 7, the state of the cells is critical. If the cells exhibit successful expansion and heap up without significant cell debris, it demonstrates the successful derivation of the intermediate mesoderm (IM), indicating the readiness to proceed to the next stage. However, if the cells show signs of initial apoptosis, followed by necrosis or breakage, it may be indicative of inappropriate concentrations of CHIR99021 or cell densities.\nOn Day 7, remove the stage II medium and wash the cells with 2 mL of DPBS.\nAdd 1 mL of the cell detachment solution to each well and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min until cells are refractive under phase contrast.\nPipette 1 mL of stage II medium to cells, mix, and ensure the cells have lifted off from the surface.\nCollect the cell suspension in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 400 x g for 3 min at room temperature.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of stage III medium (stem-cell differentiation medium containing 200 ng/mL FGF9, 1 µg/mL Heparin, and 1 µM CHIR99021 in 0.1% Methylcellulose (MC), 0.1% Polyvinylalcohol (PVA)) supplemented with 10 µM Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) (see Table of Materials). Mix it gently.\nMix the cell suspension and seed into a 6-well low-adhesion plate in a ratio of 1:3. Put the plate on an orbital shaker (CO2 resistant, rotating at 60 rpm) in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n24 h later, remove Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) and add stage III media (stem-cell differentiation medium supplement with 200 ng/mL FGF9, 1 µg/mL Heparin, 1 µM CHIR99021, 0.1% MC, 0.1% PVA). Culture for 2 days. Change the medium in the suspension culture by following the steps below:\n\t\nCut off the tip of the 1 mL pipette with aseptic scissors.\nGently shake the 6-well plate to arrange the organoids in the middle of the plate.\nAspirate the organoids with the prepared pipettes into a 15 mL tube and allow them to stand for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and leave the organoids at the bottom of the tube.\nAdd the fresh medium to resuspend the organoids and replate back into a 6-well low-adhesion plate.\nContinue shaking the low-adhesion plate at 60 rpm in the incubator. Change the stage III medium every two days until Day 12.\nOn Day 12, change the medium to stage IV medium (stem-cell differentiation medium containing 0.1% MC and 0.1% PVA).\nChange the medium every two days until Day 25. The organoids can gradually develop into mature nephron structures from Day 12-25.\n4. Immunofluorescence staining of kidney organoids\nCollect kidney organoids into a 15 mL tube and wash with 2 mL PBS.",
    "After allowing it to set for 5-10 min, fix the kidney organoids in freshly prepared 2% PFA for 20 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the PFA and wash the organoids with 1 mL PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (0.3% PBST), shake it evenly on a shaker (with a rotation speed not exceeding 60 rpm) for 8 min, allow it to stand for 5 min, and then remove the supernatant. Repeat three times.\n\tNOTE: The organoids can be stored in 0.3% PBST at 4° C for 2-4 weeks.\nIncubate the fixed organoids with 10% donkey serum in PBST (blocking buffer) (see Table of Materials) overnight at 4 °C.\nDilute the primary antibodies (listed in the Table of Materials) in a blocking buffer with a ratio of 1:300.\nIncubate the organoids with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C with agitation.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that glomeruli and tubules can be stained simultaneously on one organoid.\nWash the organoids with 1 mL 0.3% PBST, shake it evenly on a shaker (with a rotation speed not exceeding 60 rpm) for 8 min, allow it to stand for 5 min, and then remove the supernatant. Repeat three times.\nIncubate the organoids with secondary antibodies (listed in the Table of Materials) and DAPI overnight at 4 °C with agitation. Then repeat step 4.7.\n\tNOTE: Both secondary antibody and DAPI are diluted in blocking solution, secondary antibody (1:400) and DAPI (1:1000).\nAfter the staining, dehydrate the organoids with methanol (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% for 5 min each), then permeate with benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate (BABB, 1:2 ratio) (see Table of Materials) for 5 min.\nMoute the cleared organoids on a glass-bottom dish (see Table of Materials) and examine them by confocal microscopy.",
    "​NOTE: When imaging, choose the Petri dish at the bottom of the glass dish, and when permeating, put the BABB directly in the Petri dish to keep the bottom of the dish moist.\n5. In vitro dextran uptake assay\nOn Day 25, incubate the organoids with 100 µg/mL of fluorescence-labeled dextran (see Table of Materials) for 4 h in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n4 hours later, switch to a fresh medium and capture live cell culture images using a wide-field fluorescence microscope.\nSubscription Required.
