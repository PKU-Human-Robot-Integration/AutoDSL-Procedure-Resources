    "Cross-linking mouse testesDissect mouse testes, remove the outer sheath, and carefully tease apart seminiferous tubules using fine forceps (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4286/bioprotoc-12-01-4286-g002.jpgFigure 2. Dissection of mouse testis tubules. A. After euthanizing the mouse and sanitizing the abdomen with 70% ethanol, use scissors and forceps to open the abdomen and expose the fat pads in the lower peritoneal cavity (white arrowheads). B. Gently pull on the fat pad until the testis is exposed (white arrow). C. Cut the fat below the testis. D. While working under a microscope, cut the fat and epididymis away from the testis. E. Grab the tunica surrounding the testis with fine forceps. F. Gently pull the tunica away from the testis tubules. G. Carefully tease apart the seminiferous tubules using fine forceps.Place separated seminiferous tubules in a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube and incubate in 0.1% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min while rotating.Halt cross-linking by adding glycine drop-wise using a P200 pipette to a final concentration of 125 mM. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min while rotating.Pellet the tubules by spinning for 5 min at 500 × g. Remove the supernatant using a pipette and wash twice with 4°C PBS.Re-pellet the tubules, remove the PBS, and flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store at -80°C.Cross-linking magnetic Dynabeads to antibodyDay 1 Resuspend the Protein A magnetic Dynabeads by pipetting.Transfer 100 µL of Protein A Dynabeads per IP to separate 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes.Place the tubes on the magnet, remove the supernatant, and wash the beads twice with 1 mL of 3% BSA in PBST for 5 min at room temperature while rotating. After each wash, use the magnet to capture the beads, then remove and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the beads in 500 µL of 3% BSA in PBST.",
    "Set aside 200 µL for the preclear step and store at 4°C.Place the remaining 300 µL on the magnet, remove the supernatant, and resuspend in 200 µL of bead coupling buffer.Add 2 µg YTHDC2 antibody and incubate at 4°C overnight while rotating.Note: When new antibodies are used, the optimal amount of antibody should be determined by testing the immunoprecipitation efficiency on cross-linked tissue using multiple antibody concentrations (typically between 1-10 µg per immunoprecipitation). Day 2 Place the beads-antibody complex on the magnet and discard the supernatant. Wash three times with 1 mL of 0.2 M triethanolamine pH 8.2 for 5 min at room temperature while rotating. After each wash, use the magnet to capture the beads, then remove and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the beads-antibody complex in 1 mL of dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) cross-linking solution, and incubate at room temperature for 30 min while rotating.Place the tubes on the magnet to capture the beads, then remove and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the beads-antibody complex in 1 mL of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min while rotating.Wash three times with 1 mL of PBST for 5 min at room temperature while rotating. After each wash, use the magnet to capture the beads, then remove and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the beads-antibody complex in 200 µL of PBST and store at 4°C.Tissue lysisRemove the testis tubules from the freezer and quickly add 275 µL of lysis buffer with 100 U/mL RNaseOUT to each sample.Note: We used testis tubules from two postnatal day 12 (P12) mice for each immunoprecipitation. Mechanically break up the testis tubules by pipetting up and down with first a 1,000 µL and then a 200 µL pipette tip until visibly disrupted.",
    "Follow with a 25 G × 5/8 inch needle until the lysate can easily pass through the needle (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4286/bioprotoc-12-01-4286-g003.jpgFigure 3. Mechanical disruption of testis tubules. Cross-linked testis tubules (A) before and (B) after mechanical disruption in lysis buffer.Incubate the lysate at 4°C for 15 min while rotating.Sonicate the lysate in a 4°C water bath using a Bioruptor (1 cycle, 30 s pulse on Medium).Note: May need to test multiple sonication cycle numbers prior to fRIP. The 1 cycle sonication step used in this experiment was gentle enough to not degrade the RNA and protein while lightly fragmenting the RNA. Should be able to easily pipette the lysate following sonication. Spin down debris at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.Collect the supernatant and transfer it to a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube, then dilute by adding an equal volume of binding/wash buffer with 100 U/mL RNaseOUT.Calculate protein concentration using the Bradford assay.Note: We typically obtain around 1.5-2 mg total protein from each lysate (testis tubules from two P12 mice). Use between 1-2 mg total protein per IP.Preclear lysatePlace the beads previously set aside in section B for the preclear step on the magnet and remove the supernatant. Wash the beads twice with 1 mL of 3% BSA in PBST for 15 min at 4°C while rotating. Use the magnet to capture the beads, then remove and discard the supernatant.For each IP, add ~1 mg of total protein to the preclear beads and incubate the lysate for 1 h at 4°C while rotating.Use the magnet to capture the preclear beads, then collect the lysate and transfer it to a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. Keep the precleared lysate at 4°C.Set aside 1% of the volume of the precleared lysate for western blot analysis.",
    "Add protein loading buffer, boil for 5 min at 100°C, and freeze.Set aside 10% of the volume of the precleared lysate for fRIP INPUT. Keep the fRIP INPUT at 4°C.Beads-antibody preparationTo remove any non cross-linked antibody, place the cross-linked beads-antibody complex from section B on the magnet, discard the supernatant, then quickly resuspend the beads in 1 mL of 100 mM glycine pH 2.5 by inverting the tube. Immediately place the beads back on the magnet, discard the supernatant, and repeat the glycine wash.Wash the beads-antibody complex three times with 1 mL of PBST for 5 min at room temperature while rotating. After each wash, use the magnet to capture the beads, then remove and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the beads-antibody complex in 1 mL of 3% BSA in PBST and incubate for 30 min at 4°C while rotating.Wash the beads-antibody complex three times quickly in 1 mL of PBST at room temperature.

Keep the beads for the next step.Wash the beads four times with 1 mL of binding/wash buffer, rotating at 4°C for 10 min each time. After each wash, use the magnet to capture the beads, then remove and discard the supernatant. Transfer the suspended beads to new 1.7 mL low binding tubes before the final wash.",
    "After the final wash, resuspend the beads in 1 mL of binding/wash buffer and transfer to new 1.7 mL low binding tubes.Save 10% of each bead suspension for western blot to confirm successful IP and use 90% for RNA isolation.For western blot samples (10% of each IP) (Figure 4):Capture the beads using the magnet and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the beads in 100 µL of lysis buffer and transfer to new 1.7 mL low binding tubes.Place the beads on the magnet and remove the supernatant. Add 40 µL of fresh elution buffer to the beads and incubate on a heat block at 70°C for 30 min.

Western blot to confirm success of immunoprecipitation. Input and 10% of the immunoprecipitation (IP) samples from wild type (wt) were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane for analysis by western blot. IPs were performed in duplicate. The blot was probed with anti-YTHDC2 antibody.Note: Proceed with the RNA release step immediately following the immunoprecipitation. Release of RNADay 1 Place the 90% of beads set aside for RNA isolation in step F6 on the magnet and remove the supernatant.
