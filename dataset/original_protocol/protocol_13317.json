    "1. Crystal harvesting\nNOTE: Use appropriate personal protective equipment: goggles and gloves, where possible.\nAfter the SHs arrive at the user lab in combipucks (Figure 3C), separate the lid from the base of the combipuck such that the SHs remain attached to the base, and vials are retained in the lid.\nImmerse the lid with vials in liquid nitrogen. Attach an SH + adaptor (Figure 3B, right) to a magnetic wand, and harvest crystals as usual.\nFlash-cool each sample directly into the combipuck, making note of the sample position. To close the puck, use a puck wand to attach the base to the lid.\nTransfer the combipuck from liquid nitrogen to the dry shipper or liquid nitrogen storage dewar. Ship the dry shipper to Diamond (https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Common/Common-Manual/Shipping-Samples.html).\n2. Sample transfer to vacuum\nLoading of SH from combipuck to the transfer block\n\t\nPlace the base of the block puck (Figure 3H) already populated with empty transfer blocks (Figure 3D) onto its support base inside the liquid nitrogen in a foam container (Figure 3J-b).\n\t\t​NOTE: The orientation of the transfer blocks is important for the accuracy of sample transfer inside the vacuum vessel. As such, the blocks should be placed onto the block puck base making sure the pin marked with an arrow in Figure 3D is on the left of the block.\nPlace the vial puck in the foam container filled with liquid nitrogen, making sure the base of the puck is secured to the magnetic holder inside the foam container (Figure 3J-a).\nPre-cool all necessary tools in liquid nitrogen. Use the puck separator tool shown in Figure 3G on the high setting H to separate the lid from base, such that the base remains attached to the magnetic holder and the SHs are exposed inside the liquid nitrogen.",
    "To remove each SH from its adaptor, use the separator wand (Figure 3F) to pick up the SH from the combipuck base, and place into the appropriate position of the transfer block in the horizontal position of the carousel in Figure 3J-b.\n\t\t\nPlace the separator wand over the SH + adaptor as far down as it can go, making sure the wand is vertical, to avoid touching the sample.\nMove the small lever on the separator wand down with the thumb until it clicks, to secure the SH inside and pull the SH from the adaptor.\nLower the separator over the desired block position, making sure one of the three prongs fits inside the central hole of the block.\nRelease the SH by moving the lever back up. Repeat these steps for each SH.\nTo load samples into the next sample block, use the carousel key tool (Figure 3E) to rotate an empty block into the horizontal position.\nAttach the puck separator tool shown in Figure 3G using the low setting L to the lid of the block puck by screwing clockwise.\nOnce all SHs are transferred, to close the block puck, place the lid in liquid nitrogen and wait for the temperature to equilibrate, then fit the lid over the base as in Figure 3I. With the separator tool attached, lift gently to release from the carousel.\nAt this stage, the block puck can be transferred to the CTS (Figure 4B) or to a liquid nitrogen storage dewar.\nLoading of transfer blocks into the vacuum vessel\n\t\nEnsure the shuttle is securely attached to the station. Open the nitrogen gas and air valves, and ensure gases are flowing. Switch on the CTS.",
    "If no warning messages are apparent on the display, proceed with cooling down both the bath and the shuttle with liquid nitrogen. Place the supplied funnel in the filling port on the shuttle, and slowly pour liquid nitrogen into the funnel whilst monitoring the level on the screen. Stop when the indicator turns from red to blue.\n\t\tNOTE: The shuttle is ready to use when the temperature of the cold seat displayed on the touchscreen is below 100 K. The Sample Station bath can be filled simultaneously using the correct funnel to the level marked on the wall of the bath or 100% on the liquid nitrogen level display. Liquid nitrogen levels and temperature sensors should be monitored constantly throughout operation; several top-ups will be required.\nOnce the shuttle cold seat temperature is below 100 K and liquid nitrogen levels on the shuttle and bath stabilize, transfer a block puck from liquid nitrogen to the CTS bath using the attached puck separator tool. Remove the lid of the block puck, and close the lid of the CTS bath.\nTo introduce a block into the shuttle, open the CTS valve, if not already open, by pressing the Open Shuttle Valve button on the display. Unlock the shuttle handle by rotating 90° clockwise, and advance it towards the bath so that the guided track on the handle enforces the correct path of travel towards the bath. Once the block cover is visible inside the bath, allow the cover to cool. After the bubbling of liquid nitrogen around the cover has stopped, advance to the transfer block.\nTo lock the transfer block onto the shuttle, rotate the handle 180° clockwise.\nRetract the handle to the original back position, and then 'Lock' it in place by rotating 90° anti-clockwise.",
    "Press Close Shuttle Valve & Pump on the display screen to start shuttle evacuation.\nOnce the message Shuttle ready to detach is displayed on the touchscreen, press the lever underneath the shuttle, and carefully lift it using the handle at the top.\nCarry the shuttle to the airlock on the vacuum endstation in an upright position.\nAttach the shuttle to the airlock on the vacuum endstation.\n\t\tNOTE: Once securely attached, the touchscreen on the endstation will confirm the status of the shuttle and interlock.\nSelect an empty block position within the vessel by pressing the corresponding button on the touchscreen and moving the sample hotel to the correct loading position.\nOnce the sample hotel is in position, the Open button will become active. Press this button to initiate the vacuum interlock sequence.\n\t\tNOTE: The pump will start, and the progress will be displayed on the monitor. This may take up to two minutes to complete.\nAfter the sequence is complete, the status will change to Airlock open, transfer in progress. Twist the handle 90° clockwise to unlock the rod, and gently push the rod into the vessel so that the guided track again enforces the correct path of travel towards the sample hotel position. Using the video feed displayed on the screen for guidance, slowly insert the block into the hotel, ensuring that the block position light on the touch display is activated. Once activated, rotate the handle 180° anti-clockwise to release the block, and pull the rod out of the vessel. Once fully retracted, rotate the handle 90° anti-clockwise to lock the rod.",
    "Once the rod is locked, the Close button will become active. Press this to close the end station vacuum valve, and vent the space between the shuttle and the vessel to atmospheric pressure, waiting for up to 20 s for completion.\nWait for the display to show the status okay to remove shuttle once the sequence is completed. At this point, remove the shuttle, and return to the CTS to repeat the process for the next block.\nTo prepare the next block for transfer, rotate the block puck inside the bath. Push the built-in rotation key on the top of the acrylic lid down into the lock in the center of the block puck. Whilst holding it down, turn the key to position the desired block in the pick-up position.\nOnce all blocks have been transferred, ensure the shuttle valve is open whilst it is mounted on the CTS. Press the bake button on the touchscreen, and select both bath and shuttle, then press bake.\n\t\tNOTE: This warms up both the shuttle and bath to boil off the liquid nitrogen and subsequently evaporate any accumulated ice/condensation before the next use. Once the bake has started, the gas and air can be switched off."
