    "Table 1: Overview of acoustic and optical properties found in soft tissues. Optical properties cover a spectrum ranging from 600 to 900 nm. It should be noted that these are only representative values intended to provide general guidance. Precise values may vary depending on the experimental condition (e.g., temperature) and frequency/wavelength. The literature provides more specific values. *No specific reference found. Please click here to download this Table.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65475/65475_Table 1_rev.xlsx]\nThe given protocol has been developed for making ~120 mL of phantom material. The masses of the components can be scaled to make different volumes of phantom material. Please note that for larger volumes (>500 mL), the proposed equipment may not be able to sufficiently heat the phantom mixture homogenously. For this purpose, heating equipment should be adapted appropriately.\nCAUTION: Always ensure suitable personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn throughout the entire fabrication process. This may include the use of lab coats, safety goggles, and safety gloves; refer and adhere to local safety guidelines. The procedure is adapted from Hacker et al.39; a summary of the steps is displayed in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65475/65475fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Fabrication of the copolymer-in-oil material. (1) Materials for optical scattering and absorption are added to mineral oil and (2) sonicated at 90 °C until dissolved. (3) Polymer(s) and stabilizer are added, and (4) the mixture is heated up in an oil bath to 160 °C under low stirring. (5) Upon dissolution of all the components, the sample is poured into a suitable phantom mold and (6) left to harden at room temperature. This figure is reproduced from Hacker et al.39.

    "Prepare the Nigrosin stock solution by adding 0.4 g of Nigrosin to 40 mL of mineral oil. Ensure homogeneous mixing by sonication and thorough vortexing of the sample. Store the stock solution at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: The stock solution should always be thoroughly mixed before reuse. If a phantom material without an optical scatterer (TiO2) or absorber (dye) is preferred, step 1 and 2 can be skipped. Proceed with step 3.\nSonicate 0.15 g of TiO2 and 1 mL of the dye stock solution in 100 mL (83.8 g) of mineral oil until all the components have been completely dissolved (~60 min) (Figure 1: steps 1 and 2). Set the sonicator to elevated temperatures (90 °C) if the equipment allows, as this facilitates the mixing process. Proceed with steps 3-5 during the sonication time.\n\tNOTE: If a phantom with higher absorbing and scattering properties is preferred, the sonication time may need to be extended.\nWeigh out the polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at the desired concentrations (e.g., SEBS = 25.14 g; LDPE = 6.70 g) (Figure 1: step 3).\n\t\nOptional: An antioxidant may be added to increase stability, but it is not obligatory if the heating temperatures do not exceed 180°C.\n\t\tNOTE: In case solubility or viscosity issues are encountered at a later stage of the manufacturing process, it is advisable to exclude the LDPE. LDPE is incorporated to enhance the speed of sound in the material (Table 3); however, it is not mandatory for creating a stable phantom. By omitting LDPE, the manufacturing and molding process can be simplified, but it will result in a decrease in the subsequent speed of sound of the final material (Table 3).",
    "Create an oil bath using suitable glassware and silicone oil; carefully secure it on the hotplate. Ensure the thermocouple remains in the silicone oil bath and does not touch the edges of the glassware throughout the procedure (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the thermoregulatory accessory is carefully mounted, as instructed by the equipment manufacturer.\nPlace a magnetic stir bar of adequate length inside the oil bath to ensure uniform heat distribution.\nTurn on the hotplate, set the heating temperature to 160 °C, and set the revolutions per minute (rpm) of the stirrer to 50.\nTransfer the LDPE and SEBS into the glass beaker containing the sonicated mineral oil (with TiO2 and Nigrosin). Introduce a magnetic stir bar of adequate length into the glass beaker and transfer it into the center of the oil bath for heating of the measured components. Ensure that the oil level in the bath remains above the mineral oil level inside the beaker (Figure 1: step 4).\n2. Heating the mixture\nIf at any stage the added polymer appears to float over the mineral oil, manually stir the mineral oil solution using a metallic spatula, so that any floating polymer is distributed inside the mineral oil. Wear heat-resistant gloves.\nLeave the mixture at 160 °C until all the polymer has dissolved and the solution appears uniformly mixed, with a smooth and homogeneous texture (~1.5 h).\n3. Vacuuming\nNOTE: For removal of air bubbles, follow the following steps, depending on the equipment available.",
    "Place the hot beaker carefully into the vacuum chamber and vacuum the samples for 2-3 min on the highest setting (lowest vacuum). Use a metallic spatula to carefully remove any air bubbles that accumulate on the surface. If air bubbles are still present after this step, reheat the mixture and repeat the vacuuming step until all air bubbles have been removed.\nTurn on the vacuum oven and heat it up to 160 °C. Once it has reached the desired temperature, transfer the beaker with the solution into the vacuum oven.\n\tNOTE: Always handle the beaker with heat protective gloves.\n\t\nSwitch on the vacuum to the highest setting (lowest vacuum) available. If a foam layer has produced on top of the solution, turn off the vacuum and remove the bubbles from the surface using a spatula (repeat this step until all air bubbles have been removed).\nLeave the beaker in the vacuum oven for 1 h at the highest vacuum setting.\n\t\t​NOTE: To keep the vacuum oven clean, clean the external surface of the beaker of silicone oil with a paper towel. \n4. Pouring the samples into the mold\nBefore pouring the samples into sample molds, remove any remaining air bubbles on the surface of the mixture with a spatula if necessary.\nCarefully pour the solution into a suitable mold, wearing heat-resistant gloves or using adequate protective equipment. Ensure smooth and steady pouring from a low height to reduce the chance of any air bubbles forming (Figure 1: step 5). For molds with complex shapes, coat the mold with a thin layer of oil (other than mineral oil [e.g., castor or silicone oil]) prior to pouring to facilitate removal of the cured sample.\n\tNOTE: Preheating of the molds in an oven can help with achieving higher sample homogeneity.",
    "Remove any air bubbles from the top of the samples quickly with a metallic spatula once poured. If numerous air bubbles have accumulated within the mixture, repeat the vacuum step, provided that the type and shape of the mold permits it.\nAllow the solution to set at room temperature. Although smaller samples may cure in less than 2 h, leave the samples overnight to eliminate any risk of incomplete curing. Store the samples at room temperature (Figure 1: step 6).\n5. Image acquisition\nFor image acquisition, place the phantom in the field of view of the imaging device.\nFor PAI or ultrasound systems, perform acoustic coupling of the phantom surface to the ultrasound transducer, for example, with ultrasound gel or water.\n\tNOTE: If the protocol has been followed correctly, no inhomogeneities should perturb the field of view. Custom phantom holders can assist in repeatable sample positioning between measurements.\nIf the acquisition temperature differs from the storing temperature of the phantom, allow the phantom temperature to stabilize with the surroundings.\nAcquire an image.\n6. Material characterization measurements",
    "NOTE: The purpose of material characterization measurements is verification of the material optical and acoustic properties. It should be noted that the phantom fabrication protocol has shown high reproducibility39, so the general measurement protocols that follow are only provided as guidance if further verification studies are desired. The individual steps of the measurements will depend on the characterization equipment used. Here, a system based on a broadband through-transmission substitution method41 (available at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK) was employed for acoustic characterization and an in-house double-integrating-sphere (DIS) system was used (based on 42) for optical characterization. The setup of the characterization systems is displayed in Supplementary Figure 1. Additional details on the measurement setups (acoustic43; optical42,44) and measurement procedure39 can be found elsewhere. The measurement procedure should be adapted accordingly to each specific characterization system used.\nAcoustic characterization\n\tNOTE: The acoustic characterization measurements are based on a system employing a 10 MHz center frequency ultrasound transducer (active element diameter of 10 mm) for pulse generation and a broadband hydrophone (30 mm active element diameter bilaminar membrane hydrophone) for pulse detection (both placed in a water tank filled with deionized water; dimensions of 112 cm x 38 cm x 30 cm3). The transducer is driven by a pulser-receiver. Waveforms are acquired using an oscilloscope. More details on the setup and measurement procedure (including system-specific type B effects on the measurements) can be found in 43.\n\t\nPrepare samples suitable for the measurement setup (e.g., in this case, circular samples with a diameter of 7-8 cm and thickness of 6-9 mm). Ensure that the samples are of homogeneous composition and free of any impurities, air bubbles, or surface irregularities.\nMeasure the thickness of the test sample using vernier calipers and record the temperature of the water tank using a calibrated thermometer.",
    "Place the sample into the system. Ensure that the sample is correctly aligned with the components of the system.\n\t\tNOTE: An automatically controlled sample holder based on a gimbal mount43 may assist in precise control of the rotation and tilt of the sample.\nAcquire four acoustic pulses for each measurement set: a reference through-water pulse with no sample present in the acoustic path; a through-sample transmission; and acoustic reflections received at the transmitter from the front and rear surfaces of the sample.\nDerive the acoustic properties of the sample from the measurements. Calculate the speed of sound c(f) (in m·s−1) using the equation (1)43.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65475/65475eq01.jpg    (1)\ncw depicts the temperature-dependent speed of sound of water, and θ1(f), θ2(f), θw(f), and θs(f) are the corresponding unwrapped phase spectra of the front-reflected, back-reflected, through-water, and through-sample voltage pulses, respectively. The frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient (αi(f)) of the material can be derived using the two-sample substitution technique shown in equation (2)43.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65475/65475eq02v2.jpg    (2)\n\t\tUw(f) and Us(f) are the respective voltage magnitude spectra of the through-water and through-sample pulse, αw(f) is the attenuation coefficient of ultrasound (in dB·cm-1) of pure water at the specific water tank temperature45, and d1 and d2 (d2 > d1) are two sample thicknesses.\n\t\tNOTE: For the present protocol, the attenuation accounting for interfacial losses was assessed, finding its impact to be negligible.\nRepeat the measurement more than three times at different positions on the test sample. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the measurements to derive a final sample value.\nOptical characterization\n\tNOTE: For optical testing, a double-integrating sphere system was used (based on 42), employing two integrating spheres (50 mm internal diameter) that are connected to two spectrometers via two optical fibers. The reflectance sphere is connected to a light source via a third optical fiber.",
    "Prepare samples suitable for the measurement setup (e.g., in this case, rectangular samples with a width of 5.9 cm, height of 1.8 cm, and thickness ranging between 2 and 3 mm). Ensure that the samples are of homogeneous composition and free of any impurities, air bubbles, or surface irregularities.\nTurn on the light source and allow it to stabilize according to the manufacturer's instructions (e.g., 15 min).\nDetermine the thickness of the sample using vernier calipers. If applicable, specify the wavelength range and step size for the measurement (e.g., 450-900 nm with a 1 nm step size).\nRecord the reference measurements for the transmission and reflectance sphere.\n\t\t\nFor the reflectance sphere, first take an open port measurement by recording the reflectance value R0 with the transmittance sphere removed and light source turned on. Then, record the reflectance value R1 with a reference standard held in front of the reflectance sphere (light source turned on).\nFor the transmittance sphere, first take a blocked beam measurement by recording the transmittance value T0 with the aligned reflectance and transmittance spheres and light source turned off. Then, take an incident beam measurement by recording the transmittance value T1 with the aligned reflectance and transmittance spheres and light source turned on.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A clean surface of the spheres and reference standard must be ensured for the measurements, as the adherence of dust or other contaminants may impact the performance of the components46.\nPlace the sample between the spheres. Measure the reflectance Rs and transmittance Ts values. Ensure that the sample is not compressed, as this may impact the measurement accuracy. Placing one sphere on a motorized stage may help to accurately control the distance between the spheres by adapting it to the measured sample thickness.",
    "Calculate the normalized reflectance MR and transmittance MT values using equations (3) and (4)42.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65475/65475eq03.jpg    (3)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65475/65475eq04.jpg    (4)\n\t\trstd depicts the intensity reflected from the 99% reflectance standard.\nEnter the measured values into an inverse adding doubling (IAD) program (source code: http://omlc.org/software/iad/)44 to estimate the optical properties of the material.\n\t\tNOTE: Based on previous reports, the scattering anisotropy factor (g) can be taken as g = 0.7, and the refractive index as n = 1.4 30.\nRepeat the measurement at least three times at different positions along the test sample. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the measurements to derive a final sample value."
