    "The protocol is approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use. Dahl salt-sensitive rats (males and females), ~8 weeks of age, 200-350 g, were used for the experiments.\n1. Animal preparation\nInstall a movement response caging system for the rat, a perivascular flow module, syringe pump, recording device, and software (see Table of Materials) in the animal room.\nPlace the rats in the cage to become familiar with the environment, food, and water system at least the week prior to surgery. Fast the rats from the day before the surgery because a high stomach content may interfere with the placement of the flow probe into the left renal artery and can cause tracheal aspiration.\nConnect a 5 cm of polyurethane tubing (inner diameter 0.30 mm and outer diameter 0.64 mm) to the end of the 90 cm of polyurethane tubing (inner diameter 0.64 mm and outer diameter 1.02 mm) with PVC cement to make a femoral arterial catheter (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nSterilize the catheters with an Ethylene oxide sterilizer, the flow probe with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and the surgical instruments in a steam autoclave. Wipe surgical tables, microscopy, and lights with 1% sodium hypochlorite.\n2. Surgery\nPlace the RBF probe following the steps below.\n\t\nAnesthetize the rats with 2.0%-2.5% Isoflurane to the degree that the rats do not respond to the pain stimulus. Place it on the surgical table set at 37 °C and inject 0.09 mg/kg of buprenorphine SR and 15 mg/kg of cefazolin (see Table of Materials) before surgery.\nShave the entire abdomen with an electric clipper and a region on the nape of the neck around the 7th cervical vertebrae where the catheter and flow prove wires will exit.",
    "After shaving, wipe the area with 70% ethanol, 10% povidone-iodine, and again with 70% ethanol.\nPlace the rat in the prone position. Make a 1 cm cut using a scalpel on the nape of the neck and the left flank. Then, perform a blunt dissection with hemostatic forceps and clear a subcutaneous space from the flank incision to the back of the neck.\nPass the flow probe through this subcutaneous tunnel from the neck to the flank incision with hemostatic forceps.\nPlace the rat in the supine position. Make a 4-5 cm midline abdominal incision.\nDissect the area around the renal artery with curved tweezers to expose a space sufficient to place the flow probe (see Table of Materials). Then bluntly pierce the left quadratus lumborum muscle with the hemostatic forceps and pull the head of the flow probe into the abdominal cavity.\nHook the tip of the flow probe to the left renal artery and connect it to the flow meter (see Table of Materials). Add some gel around the probe tip, and the value of the flow rate will appear on the flow meter.\n\t\tNOTE: Although it depends on the size of the rat, a flow of about 3-5 mL/min will be observed in a 230 g rat.\nGlue the polyester fiber mesh attached to the probe with tissue adhesive to the abdominal wall and hold until dry and bonded (~1-2 min). Once the flow is in place, disconnect the flow probe from the flow meter and cover the abdomen with saline-soaked gauze and move on to the step of inserting the catheter.\nInsert the femoral catheter following the steps below.",
    "NOTE: The method for inserting a fluid-filled catheter is the same as regular telemetry installations. Although telemetry is preferred, the arterial catheter enables pressure monitoring and period blood sampling from the conscious rat.\n\t\nFirst, fill the catheter with saline and clamp it with vascular forceps before making a 1 cm skin incision using a scalpel on the left thigh to dissect and expose the femoral artery. While blocking the flow at the proximal side of the femoral artery with a thread, insert the catheter.\nFlush with a small amount of saline, plug with appropriate size stainless wire, and tie the catheter with a thread to fix it.\nOnce the ligature is tied around the catheter, create a subcutaneous tunnel by using a stainless-steel trocar from the thigh to the back of the neck to bring the catheter to the neck region. Secure it with 3-0 silk sutures placed in the trapezius muscle.\nSuture the probe.\n\t\nTurn the rat to the prone position and stitch the circular loop of the flow probe subcutaneously at the flank. Suture the incision at the flank and the neck with 4-0 surgical suture (see Table of Materials).\nAttach a skin button to the flow probe and suture it with 3-0 silk at the back of the neck.\nConnect the flow probe to the flow meter again, turn the rat back to the dorsal position to check RBF, and make final adjustments of the flow probe to optimize its position on the renal artery.\nFinally, suture the muscle with 3-0 silk and the skin with 4-0 surgical suture.\n3. Recovery of the animal",
    "After careful observation, until the rats are fully recovered from the anesthesia, return the rats to a movement response caging system, connect the flow probe to the blood flow meter, and allow a recovery period of about a week to stabilize the probe and flow measurement.\n\tNOTE: Recording doesn't have to be done during this period.\nInfuse 3% heparinized saline continuously throughout the study from the arterial catheter at the rate of 100 µL/h to prevent the clotting.\nWhen the flow stabilizes after 5-6 days, set the flowmeter calibration to measure blood flow at 0-20 mL/min and begin the continuous recording of RBF.\nSubscription Required.
