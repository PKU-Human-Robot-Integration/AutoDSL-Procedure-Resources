Schedule of murine myeloid progenitor transformation assay Virus preparationOn day 1, thaw PLAT-E cells from frozen stock and culture 4 x 106 cells in 10-cm dishes with 10 ml of D10 media (see Recipes) in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator.On day 3, replate 8 x 105 PLAT-E cells in 6-cm collagen-coated dishes with 5 ml of D10 media in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator (one positive control [MLL-ENL], one negative control [empty vector; pMSCV-neo], two mock controls for G418 selection, and samples [up to 16 samples]).On day 4, transfect PLAT-E cells with 8 µg of DNA and 20 µl of LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent. At the time of transfection, the cell confluency should be 60-70%. (In detail, dilute 8 µg of DNA in 500 µl of Opti-MEMTM media and dilute 20 µl of LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent in 500 µl of Opti-MEMTM media, separately. After 5 min, combine the DNA solution with the LipofectamineTM 2000 solution. Mix gently and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Add the DNA-Lipofectamine mixture to each dish and incubate in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator.) After 6 h, replace the media with fresh D10 media and incubate in a 32 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 2 days. Note: Virus supernatant should be freshly prepared in every experiment because retrovirus is unstable for storage.",
    "Preparation of c-kit (CD117)-positive progenitor cellsOn day 5, harvest the femurs and tibiae and remove the peripheral muscle as thoroughly as possible from a five-week-old C57BL/6J mouse (Figure 2A).Cut the end of femurs and tibiae and flush bone marrow with 10 ml of PBS (see Recipes) using a 10-ml syringe attached with a 21 G needle (Figure 2B) (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Bone marrow isolation from tibiae by flushing with PBS Homogenize the bone marrow cells gently by passing through a 21 G needle several times.Spin down the cells at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature (Figure 2C left) and then remove as much of the supernatant as possible.Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of ACK lysis buffer (see Recipes) and incubate for 1 min on ice.Add 10 ml of R10W10 media (see Recipes) and spin down cells at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and then remove the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 10 ml of SM buffer (see Recipes) and spin down cells at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature (Figure 2C right), and then remove the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 0.5 ml of SM buffer, add 20 µl of CD117 microbeads, and incubate for 20 min on ice or in the refrigerator.Add 10 ml of SM buffer and spin down cells at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and then remove the supernatant to wash the cells.Wash the cells again as in step B9.Install an MS column on a magnetic stand and equilibrate with 1 ml of SM buffer.Place a pre-separation filter on top of the column and load the cells onto the MS column through the pre-separation filter (Figure 2D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171127/20171127215552_4850.jpgFigure 2.

    "Flushing the bone marrow with PBS; C. Red blood cell removal by ACK buffer treatment; D. c-kit-positive cell isolation by MACS.Wash the column twice with 1 ml of SM buffer.Remove the column from the magnetic stand and place it on a new 15-ml conical tube.Add 1 ml of SM buffer to the column to elute c-kit-positive cells by gravity flow (optionally using a plunger).Add 10 ml of R10W10 media and spin down the cells at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and then remove the supernatant.Resuspend all of the cells in 1 ml of R10W10 and transfer into one well in a 48-well plate.Add cytokines (10 ng/ml SCF, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml IL-6 at the final concentration) and incubate the cells in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator overnight.Virus transduction and cell cultureOn day 6, count the cells. A total of 1-2 x 106 c-kit-positive cells are expected from each mouse.Add an appropriate amount of R10W10 media to prepare a 1 x 105 cells/ml suspension and add a 1/250 volume of 10 mg/ml polybrene solution.Aliquot 0.5 ml of cell suspensions into 15-ml conical tubes (additionally, prepare two mock infection controls).Suck 5 ml of the virus supernatant using a 5-ml syringe, attach a filter (0.45-µm) to the 5-ml syringe, and add the virus supernatant directly to the c-kit-positive cell suspension.Spin the cell suspension at 1,100 x g for 2.5 h at 32 °C (Spinoculation).During spinoculation, add 1 ml of PBS onto PLAT-E cells, harvest the cells using a cell lifter, and transfer the cells into a new tube.Wash the packaging cells with 1 ml of PBS again and prepare the whole cell lysate in 500 µl of WB lysis buffer.",
    "After spinoculation, remove the virus supernatant (leaving approximately 200 µl of media), resuspend the cells in residual media, add 1 ml of AC media (see Recipes) using a 1-ml syringe attached with an 18 G needle, and mix by vortexing. Note: Use a 1-ml syringe and a needle to take 1 ml of AC media because this media is very viscous. A pipet cannot be used. Incubate the 15-ml conical tubes containing the cells in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator overnight.On day 7, add 20 µl of G418 solution, mix by vortexing, and transfer the cells into a 12-well plate using a 1-ml syringe attached with an 18 G needle. For the two mock controls, add G418 in one tube to ensure that G418 selection is working. Note: Samples should be placed in the central 6 wells in a 12-well plate and PBS should be added to the peripheral 6 wells to prevent the cultures in AC media from drying.Incubate in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 5 days (Figure 3). If media turns orange during culture because of excess cells, add an additional 1 ml of AC media with G418. Note: It is important to maintain good culture conditions. Overgrowth drastically affects colony formation in the next round of culture.Optionally, one can check the protein expression of transgenes in the packaging cells by WB during the first round of culture.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171127/20171127215803_9849.jpgFigure 3. Image of colonies during the 1st and 4th rounds of culture1st passageOn day 12, collect cells with 10 ml of PBS, transfer to a 15-ml conical tube, and spin down at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Wash the cells with 10 ml of PBS. Note: It is important to suspend thoroughly by vigorous pipetting to remove the debris of AC media.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of R10W10 media and count the cells.Transfer 4 x 104 cells to a new 15-ml conical tube and add an appropriate amount of R10W10 to prepare a 200-µl cell suspension.Add 1 ml of AC media and mix by vortexing.Transfer the cells into a well in a new 12-well plate using a 1-ml syringe attached with an 18 G needle. Note: Samples should be placed in the central 6 wells in a 12-well plate and PBS should be added to the peripheral 6 wells to prevent the cultures in AC media from drying.Incubate the cells in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 5 days. If the media turns orange during culture, add an additional 1 ml of AC media to the well.Optionally, collect residual cells into a new tube and lyse the cells in RLT lysis buffer containing 1% beta-mercaptoethanol of an RNeasy® mini kit for RNA isolation as described in Procedure E.Cell collection and analysisIsolate the RNA using the RNeasy® mini kit and synthesize cDNA using the Superscript® III first-strand synthesis system with oligo-dT primers.Evaluate gene expression by quantitative PCR. In case of myeloid progenitor transformation by MLL-fusion genes, Hoxa9 gene expression is a good indicator of immortalization.2nd passageOn day 17, harvest and count the cells as in 1st passage.Culture 2 x 104 cells/well.Colony counting and 3rd passageOn day 22, count the colony number under a microscope. Note: No colonies should be observed in the vector control. It is important to set a standard which defines a colony and use this definition throughout the study. We typically consider a cluster of more than 100 cells as a colony. Harvest and count the cells as in the 1st passage. Culture 1 x 104 cells/well.",
