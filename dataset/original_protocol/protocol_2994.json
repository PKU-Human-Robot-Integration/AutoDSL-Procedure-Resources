    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInduction of mutations in the wild type virus\nTiming: 1 week\nThe aim of this step is to generate a virus library containing mutated viruses.\nSeed Vero cells (5 × 105 cells/mL, 2 mL/well) in 6-well plates, 1 day before viral infection and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nInduce mutations.\nViral infection.\nRemove the medium.\nInfect the cells by adding a small amount of medium (200–500 μL) containing the virus with an infectious titer of about 1 × 106 wild type viruses (Multiplicity of infection (MOI) is 1.0.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h to allow the virus to adsorb.\nMutation induction.\nRemove the supernatant.\nNote: Remove viral supernatant with a micropipette, not with an aspirator, to avoid producing aerosols. Disinfect infectious wastewater by adding a 500–1000 ppm sodium hypochlorite solution. Autoclave all instruments suspected to be virus-contaminated.\nAdd 2 mL of fresh pre-warmed DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS and 400 μg/mL 5-FU (FUJIFILM Wako, Cat#068-01401) to induce mutations.\nIncubate at 32°C, 5% CO2 for 24–36 h to permit temperature sensitive virus to proliferate.\nCollect the supernatant.\nCentrifuge and collect the supernatant containing mutated viruses.\nNote: The concentration of 5-FU should be optimized depending on the sensitivity of the cells and viruses. The growth rate of 5-FU-treated viruses should be lower than that of non-treated ones. A previous study showed that a concentration of 350–450 μg/mL of 5-FU was enough to in inhibit murine hepatitis virus amplification by 90%.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] We used 400 μg/mL. For other viruses, we recommend evaluating viral amplification under several 5-FU concentrations conditions that do not significantly affect the host cells.",
    "Seed Vero cells (5 × 105 cells/mL, 2 mL/well) in 6-well plates, 1 day before viral infection, and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nAmplification of the mutated viruses at a lower temperature.\nInfect the pre-seeded Vero cells by adding 50 μL of the mutated viruses obtained in step 2-b-v.\nIncubate at 32°C, 5% CO2 for 3–4 days, until cytopathic effect (CPE) is observed using an optical microscope.\nNote: Virus passaging should be performed when CPE is observed.\nCollect the supernatant.\nCentrifuge and collect the supernatant. This virus solution will be used for TS clones’ selection.\nStore at −80°C.\nNote: We used 5-FU, but other agents (e.g., azacytidine) may be used for inducing mutations.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] See also problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nSelection of TS clones\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThe aim of this step is to isolate a large number of single virus clones and to screen for the TS phenotype.\nSeed Vero cells (5 × 105 cells/mL, 2 mL/well) in 6-well plates, 1 day before viral infection and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nPlaque formation (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2743-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic figure of steps 5 to 6\nMake 10-fold serial dilutions of the mutated virus solution obtained in step 4 (10−3–10−8).\nRemove the medium from the cultured Vero cells of step 5.\nAdd enough volume of the diluted virus solutions (250–500 μL) to the cells, to prevent them from drying during adsorption.\nIncubate at 32°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h to allow the virus to adsorb.\nNote: In the procedure for plaque formation, to prevent cells from drying out during virus adsorption, rock plates occasionally.\nRemove the virus solution.\nWash the cells once with PBS.",
    "Pour 2 mL of fresh medium containing 1% (w/v) SeaPlaque agarose onto the cells and wait until it solidifies. Viral spread is inhibited by SeaPlaque agarose, which allows infection to progress only from infected cells to neighboring cells, resulting in the formation of plaques.\nNote: Agar solutions should be kept at approximately 40°C to prevent solidification and not to kill the cells.\nIncubate at 32°C, 5% CO2 for 4–5 days until plaques are clearly visible.\nSeed Vero cells (2.5 × 105 cells/mL, 100 μL/well) in 96-well plates 1 day before plaque picking, and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12–18 h. Make sure to prepare double number of plates (See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2743-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic figure of steps 7 to 9\nPlaque picking (See Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2743-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Plaque-picking procedure\nDispense 100 μL of Vero cell-optimal medium into each well of new 96-well plates (U bottom).\nIdentify and mark the plaques from the underside of the plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPick up the plaques with a Pasteur pipette or pipette tip.\nNote: For the isolation of single virus clones, care should be taken not to pick overlapping plaques. Therefore, it is preferable to make multiple dilutions of the virus solution to form 10–20 plaques in one well.\nSuspend the pieces of gel by adding them one by one onto separate wells containing medium (in the 96-well plates prepared in step 8-a).\nChecking temperature sensitivity (related to problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1], Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] 2).\nAdd 50 μL of the content of each well from step 8-d to the Vero cells on the two 96-well plates prepared in step 7, following the same layout so as to obtain duplicate plates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] 2).",
    "Incubate one of the duplicate plates at 32°C, and other plate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for at least 5 days to reduce the possibility of false positives.\nCheck each individual well for the presence of CPE.\nNote: If the virus shows a temperature-sensitive phenotype, it will be CPE-positive at 32°C and CPE-negative at 37°C (expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] 2).\nCollect the temperature-sensitive viruses from the CPE-positive wells of the plates incubated at 32°C.\nStore at −80°C.\n(Additional) To isolate single clones of temperature-sensitive viruses, repeat steps 5–9, two or three times.\nNote: Performing step 10 is recommended to minimize contamination and ensure viral clonality.\nIdentification of TS-responsible substitutions\nTiming: 4–6 weeks\nThe aim of this step is to identify the mutations responsible for the TS phenotype by obtaining revertants and checking their genomic sequences.\nExtract RNA from the 140 μL of the viruses obtained in steps 9-d to 10 using TriReagent[href=https://www.mrcgene.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TRI-BDMarch2017.pdf] (Molecular Research Center, Cat# TR118) or a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=c80685c0-4103-49ea-aa72-8989420e3018&lang=en] (Qiagen, Cat# 52904), without carrier RNA, according to the manufacturers’ protocols.\nDetermine the entire sequences of each viral clone via next generation sequencing, after preparing the samples with any appropriate commercially available kits.\nNote: For next generation sequencing, we requested the NGS core facility of the Genome Information Research Center at the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University for the processing and sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Synthesis of cDNA was performed using GenNext RamDA-seq Single Cell Kit (TOYOBO, Cat#RMD-101). Illumina library construction was performed using Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, Cat#FC-131-1096) and Nextera XT Index Kit v2 (Illumina, Cat#FC-131). Sequencing was performed on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) with 150 bp paired-end mode. The obtained reads were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench 21.\nCompare full genome sequence with parental strain and identify mutations.",
    "Seed Vero cells (2.5 × 105 cells/mL, 100 μL/well) in 96-well plates (at least 2 plates for each temperature to be tested in step 16), 1 day before virus infection, and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nAdd the virus obtained in steps 9-d to 10, to all wells at a MOI = 1.0–10.0.\nIncubate at non-permissive temperatures (in this case 37, 38 or 39°C) for 2–5 days.\nNote: We recommend to try this step at 37, 38, and 39°C. Because the temperature sensitivity of the virus strains might vary, there is a possibility that revertants emerge only at higher temperatures (38°C–39°C) (See problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nCollect cell culture aliquots from CPE-positive wells which may include revertants (See problems 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7], limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]).\nExtract RNA from the samples obtained in step 17 using TriReagent[href=https://www.mrcgene.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TRI-BDMarch2017.pdf] (Molecular Research Center, Cat# TR118) or a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=c80685c0-4103-49ea-aa72-8989420e3018&lang=en] (Qiagen, Cat# 52904), according to the manufacturers’ protocols.\nSynthesize cDNA using the SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FsuperscriptIIIfirststrand_pps.pdf] (Invitrogen, Cat# 18080051) with random primers, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nAmplify the genomic regions surrounding each mutation of interest via PCR using specific primers (See key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nDetermine the sequence of the PCR products through Sanger sequencing and compare them to those of the corresponding parental TS strains.\nNote: The primers we used are listed in the Key Resources Table. Sanger sequencing was requested to Azenta Co., Ltd. (Japan).",
    "Note: If mutations are found to have changed back to the wild type, these could be the responsible mutations. However, viruses may not be typical revertants whose mutations change back to the wild type sequence. For example, the reversions may involve amino acids with similar polarity in the positions initially affected or in their interacting counterparts within the 3D structure of the protein. See problems 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nNote: The sample size to obtain revertants depends on the characteristics of each TS strain, the conditions of the experiments, such as MOI and culture temperature (pressure). In our study, when culturing at 37°C and MOI = 1.0, the frequency of revertant-containing wells was 15.2% (35/230) and 0.9% (2/230) for the highest and lowest strains, respectively. Therefore, you need to try to analyze a considerable number of wells.\nReconstruction of temperature-sensitive virus by reverse genetics\nTiming: 2.5 weeks\nThe aim of this step is to confirm whether the mutations observed in the revertants were TS-responsible mutations, and to construct recombinant strains following reverse genetics methods (e.g., circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER)5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). We utilized CPER with few modifications, as described below (See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2743-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic figure of steps 22 to 31\nCritical: Torii et al. transfected the CPER products to tetracycline-inducible ACE2- and TMPRSS-expressing IFNAR1-deficient HEK293 (HEK293-3P6C33) cells.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] However, in our study, viral reconstruction was not successful at 32°C with these cells. Alternatively, to obtain TS-recombinant viruses, we used BHK-hACE2 cells because they can replicate with high transfection efficacy even at low temperatures (See also problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations]).\nSeed BHK-hACE2 cells (1 × 105 cells/mL, 2 mL/well) in 6-well plates, 1 day before transfection and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12–18 h.",
    "Note: Establishment of the BHK-hACE2 cell line is described in the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section.\nAssemble SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments by CPER using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Cat# R050A), according to Torii et al., 2021.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] Mix the fragments with the polymerase and perform the reaction following the information on the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2743_7.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2743_8.csv\nUse 25 μL of the 50 μL assembled circular-DNA reaction mix from step 23, without prior purification, to transfect BHK-hACE2 cells, using Lipofectamine LTX Reagent with PLUS™ Reagent[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FLipofectamineLTX_PLUS_Reag_protocol.pdf] (Invitrogen, Cat# 15338100) according to the manufacture’s protocol.\nIncubate at 32°C, 5% CO2, for 7 days.\nMake sure to seed VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells (5 × 105 cells/mL, 2 mL/well) in 6-well plates, 1 day before virus recovery, and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nCollect the supernatants.\nTo confirm the proper reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 by CPE, use 2 mL of these supernatants to infect VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells and incubate at 32°C, 5% CO2, for up to 7 days.\nNote: Since there may be less virus in the supernatant after transfection, VeroE6-TMPRSS2, which is more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2, is useful for the initial virus amplification. Then, reconstructed viruses can be passaged in Vero cells to be used in various assay.\nIf the recombinant virus strains were successfully reconstructed, CPE will be observed (expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] 3).\nMake sure to seed Vero cells (5 × 105 cells/mL, 2 mL/well) in 6-well plates, 1 day before virus infection, and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nCollect supernatants and transfer 10–50 μL to the newly prepared Vero cells to amplify the recombinant viruses.\nIncubate at 32°C for 3–4 days, until CPE was observed.\nCollect the supernatants containing the recombinant viruses.\nEvaluate growth kinetics of recombinant viruses at 32°C–39°C, to confirm their temperature sensitivity (expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] 41[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])."
