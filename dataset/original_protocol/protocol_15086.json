    "All animal studies and experiments were conducted under a protocol approved by the University of California, Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Administrative Advisory Committee.\n1. MUC1.Tg Mouse Breeding and Propagation\nThe UC Davis Mouse Biology Program (MBP) breeds wild type C57BL/6 male mice with heterozygous MUC1.Tg C57BL/6 female mice to establish our breeding colony. MUC1.Tg offspring are delivered for studies as needed.\nMBP personnel clip the toes of the offspring in a defined pattern (0-99) for mouse identification, and when applicable clip the tail. The toe or tail tissue is processed for genotyping using standard DNA extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis.\n2. Study Design\nStudy Group Assignments\n\t\nWeigh each mouse separately on a balance and record the weight in grams for each mouse.\nThis part of the procedure involves the methodology and design of the study. For the first part of the study, assign age-matched MUC1.Tg and wild type mice to start bladder cancer induction with OH-BBN. Euthanize mice 8 weeks after the last OH-BBN dose to confirm the presence of bladder tumors by histology.\nFor the second part of the study, randomize male MUC1.Tg mice into the appropriate number of treatment and control groups. These mice will be monitored for serum cytokines and T-cell immune responses during induction and tumor development, and then at termination of the study 8 weeks after the last OH-BBN dose.\nBladder Cancer Induction\n\t\nOH-BBN is a carcinogen and highly toxic. Please read and follow the guidelines of the material safety data sheet when handling and storing this chemical.\nCalculate the dosing solution concentration needed to deliver the appropriate dose (3 mg), in a volume of 100 μl, to each mouse based on the average weights and number of mice in each study and group.",
    "Dilute the OH-BBN in 100% ethanol. Bring the final concentration to 30 mg/ml with sterile water. The final ethanol:water concentration should be 20:80, v/v.\nAdminister the OH-BBN orally using stainless steel, 20 G gavage needles daily, 5 days/week for 12 weeks, based on the treatment group assignment starting at the age of 8 weeks.\nVaccination Treatments\n\t\nReconstitute each vial of lyophilized peptide vaccine in 600 μl of 0.9% sterile saline and thoroughly resuspend by drawing the solution through a 0.5 inch 27 G needle 6x. Using saline, adjust the concentration so that the desired dose is delivered in a volume of 100 μl.\nStarting in Week 20, after the last dose of OH-BBN, administer the vaccine on a weekly basis for an eight-week cycle by subcutaneous injection of 100 μl using a 25 G needle (week number corresponds to the age of the mice).\nMonitoring and Sample Collection\n\t\nWeigh all mice and palpate for the presence of new tumors once each week. Euthanize any mice that have lost ≥20% of body weight or if there are palpable tumors, blood in the urine, and/or urinary retention.\nPrior to the first OH-BBN dose and then at 4 week intervals thereafter, collect whole blood via submandibular bleeds. Collect the blood in serum clotting tubes (BD Microtainer), and allow 30 min for the blood to clot.\nCentrifuge the blood samples in a microcentrifuge at 3,500 x g for 10 min. Carefully transfer the serum to screw cap cryotubes using a pipette.\nFlash freeze in liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C until further analysis by multiplex.\nEight weeks after the last dose of OH-BBN, euthanize all mice by CO2 asphyxiation.\nPlace each mouse on a dissection board and pin down by all four limbs.",
    "Using forceps and scissors, make a horizontal incision in the upper abdominal region. Insert the scissors into the incision between the epidermal layer and abdominal wall and gently separate the skin from the underlying tissue with the help of forceps.\nMake a vertical incision from the horizontal incision following the middle axis towards the anterior end of the mouse. Separate the skin from the rib cage, and using a 1 ml syringe and a 22 G needle, puncture the heart and collect blood with a smooth and steady draw.\nRefer to step 2.4.3 and 2.4.4 for serum isolation and storage.\nUsing forceps and scissors, cut and peel back the rest of the epidermal layer. Cut through the abdominal wall and peritoneum and aseptically remove bladder tumor for Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot.\nCollect spleen for cell viability analysis (Muse) and ELISpot. For IHC, place bladder tumor specimen in tissue cassette and fix in chilled formalin overnight at room temperature.\nThe following day, replace the formalin with 70% ethanol.\nFor Western blot analysis of tumor, homogenize the tumor, add protein extraction buffer plus Halt protease inhibitors and transfer to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.\nVortex for 30-60 sec and hold on ice for 5 min. Flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and thaw in ambient water. Repeat the process of vortexing, freezing and thawing twice.\nCentrifuge the samples at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and transfer the cellular extracts to new labeled tubes.\nQuantify the concentration by performing a Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay (BCA) for protein measurements. Store samples at -80 °C until ready for Western blot analysis.\n3. Molecular Biology/Western\nThe following procedures were performed to verify the expression of MUC1 in mouse bladder tumor tissue using standard Western Blot protocol (data not shown).",
    "Separate the protein extracts by SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transfer onto PVDF membrane using semidry apparatus.\nBlock the protein transferred membrane with 5% nonfat milk in 0.1% Tween-20 in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS-T) pH 7.4 for 1 hr on an orbital shaker at room temperature.\nIncubate the membrane for 1 hr at room temperature on a shaker with anti-MUC1 or anti-β-actin antibody in 0.1% PBS-T.\nWash the membrane by decanting the solution and adding 0.1% PBS-T. Swirl the membrane on the shaker for 5 min and decant. Repeat this step twice.\nIncubate the membrane for 1 hr at room temperature with a horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody.\nWash 3x (refer to step 3.4).\nFollow the protocol for the Enhanced Chemiluminesence (ECL) kit to activate and read the fluorography.\n4. Multiplex Fluorometric Microbead Immunoassay\nSetup and Calculations\n\t\nUsing a 96-well plate map, assign blanks, standards, controls, and unknowns to the wells. Calculate the number and volume of analytes, capture antibodies and Streptavidin-Phycoerythrin (SA-PE) needed for the assay.\nAllow all buffers and diluents to equilibrate to room temperature. Prepare the standards and sample dilutions using a blank 96-well plate.\nReconstitute the serum matrix and lyophilized standard according to the manufacturer's protocol and make 1:5 serial dilutions of the standard with the appropriate diluent in the 96-well plate. For the blank wells, use the appropriate diluent.\nDilute all controls and unknown samples 1:2 in the appropriate diluent in the rest of the 96-well plate.\nFor the bead mix, pipette the required volume of the appropriate diluent into a 15 ml tube. Vortex each bead vial for 20 sec and pipette the required volume of each analyte into the 15 ml tube.",
    "Always protect the beads from light to avoid photobleaching. Do not place the 96-well plate on absorbent material to avoid loss of sample through wicking.\nAssay Protocol\n\t\nPrewet the 96-well filter bottom plate with 200 μl of Assay Buffer and allow for complete soaking of the filter. Gently drain by using the 96-well plate vacuum apparatus and blot dry the bottom of the plate with a paper towel.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, pipette 25 μl of serum matrix to the wells assigned for the blanks and standards and pipette 25 μl of Assay Buffer to the wells assigned for the controls and unknowns.\nPipette 25 μl of the blank, standards, controls, and unknowns to the respective assigned wells. Vortex the bead mix for 20 sec and transfer the beads to a reservoir.\nPipette 25 μl of the bead mix into each well. Cover the plate with aluminum foil or an opaque plate lid to protect from light.\nShake the plate at 500 rpm for two hours at room temperature on a plate shaker. Drain and wash the plate with 200 μl of 0.1% Tween 20 in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS-T) twice. Drain and blot dry.\nPrepare the capture antibody solution. Pipette the required amount of 0.1% PBS-T and capture antibody into a 15 ml tube and vortex for 10 sec. Transfer the capture antibody mix to a reservoir and pipette 25 μl into each well.\nShake the plate at 500 rpm for one hour at room temperature on a plate shaker. Drain and wash the plate with 200 μl of 0.1% PBS-T twice. Drain and blot dry.",
    "Prepare the SA-PE solution. Pipette the required volume of 0.1% PBS-T and SA-PE into a 15 ml tube and vortex for 10 sec. Transfer the solution to a reservoir and pipette 25 μl into each well.\nShake the plate at 500 rpm for 30 min at room temperature on a plate shaker. Drain and wash the plate with 200 μl of 0.1% PBS-T twice. Drain and blot dry.\nPipette 100 μl of 0.1% PBS-T and shake on a plate shaker at 500 rpm for at least two minutes to resuspend the beads. Read and analyze the plate on the Luminex Lx200 machine.\n5. IFN-γ/IL-4 ELISpot Preparation and Analysis\nIn a biological safety cabinet, process the spleens through 100 μm Nylon tissue sieves into 5 ml sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) in sterile Petri dishes. Layer the splenocytes onto 3 ml of lymphocyte separation medium in sterile 15-ml tubes.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 600 x g for 15 min to separate the lymphocytes from the red blood cells. Transfer the layered lymphocytes above the gradient to new sterile 15-ml tubes.\nAdjust the volume to 10 ml with sterile PBS. Centrifuge the suspension at 600 x g for 10 min to pellet the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 ml of PBS for cell viability and count with the Muse analyzer. Follow the Muse Count & Viability Kit protocol.\nMake serial dilutions of the lymphocytes in 1.5 ml screw cap centrifuge tubes at dilution factors of 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40 (or as necessary) in Count & Viability Reagent (minimum total volume 300 μl). Pipette each dilution up and down several times to mix and analyze on the Muse.",
    "Prepare a plate map of the samples and conditions for the ELISpot plate. Prepare the ELISpot plate according to the manufacturer's protocol and pipette 100 μl of medium, peptide (10 μg/ml), or scramble peptide (10 μg/ml) to each well.\nPipette 100 μl of cell suspension, delivering 1.0 x 106 cells to each well and incubate the plate at 37 °C overnight.\nFollow the manufacturer's protocol for the ELISpot assay. Analyze the developed ELISpot plate using a dissection microscope.\nQuantify the results by counting the number of colored spots corresponding to each analyte in each well. The spots correspond to the number of spot-forming cells (SFC) in each well.\n6. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) Staining\nTake bladder tumor tissue preserved as described above (Section 2.4.11), embed in paraffin and step-section at 4 μm for immunohistochemical analysis.\nPerform IHC using a MUC1 antibody that recognizes the tandem repeat region of MUC1. Use the Animal Research Kit peroxidase to minimize the reactivity of the secondary mouse antibody with endogenous immunoglobulin present in the tissue.\nPerform H&E staining using standard protocols.\n7. Statistical Methods\nFor the Multiplex Fluorometric Microbead Immunoassay, use a two-tailed Student's t-test to compare the average observed serum cytokine concentrations between the treatment and control groups. For ELISpot, use a one-way ANOVA to compare the spot forming colonies between the media control, scrambled peptide and peptide groups. Use Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test to lessen the likelihood of a false positive result. A p-value of ≤0.05 is considered significantly different for all analyses.Subscription Required.
