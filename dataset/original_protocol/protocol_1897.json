    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart A. Tail skin wholemount staining\nCollection and fixation of tail skin\nTiming: 2.5 h\nUse postnatal day 18 mice for the experiment demonstrated here. But mice of all ages could use this tail skin epidermis wholemount protocol. Sacrifice mice using CO2.\nMark the middle one third of the dorsal tail along the anterior-posterior central axis (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1491-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Collect epidermis with hair follicle of tail skin\n(A) The workflow of collection of tail skin sample for wholemount staining.\n(B) The middle-third dorsal side of tail skin is used for experimental consistency.\n(C) Cut along the middle line of the ventral tail skin.\n(D) Dorsal pieces of tail skin before EDTA treatment. Scale bar, 500 mm.\n(E) Dorsal pieces of tail skin were clipping to 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm for EDTA treatment.\n(F) EDTA treatment in 5 mL tube.\n(G) Epidermis with hair follicles is separated from the whole tail skin after EDTA treatment.\nMark the ventral midline of the mouse tail (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCut along the marked ventral midline with a pair of surgical scissors.\nRemove the skin from the tail bone using surgical tweezers.\nUse the middle one third of the dorsal side tail skin and cut it into smaller pieces with a scalpel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). The length of each piece is 0.5 cm, and width is 0.5 cm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nPlace the square skin pieces in at least 5 mL of 25 mM EDTA in 1× PBS buffer for 2 h at 37°C on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F) (Xu et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).",
    "Note: In tail skin wholemount staining, if one intended to make sure anagen hair follicles are separated along with the epidermis from the dermis, 2 h EDTA treatment needs to be increased to 4 h EDTA treatment.\nSeparate the epidermis with attached hair follicles from the dermis using a pair of fine-tipped tweezers.\nNote: an anterior-to-posterior peeling direction should be used to keep hair follicles attached to the epidermis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nPlace removed epidermis with attached hair follicles in 1 mL 4% formaldehyde in 1× PBS buffer for 7 min in 24-well dish at room temperature.\nNote: the hair follicle side should face down in the fixation solution.\nRemove the epidermis with attached hair follicles from the fixation solution and wash with 1 mL of 1× PBS for 3 × 30 min in 24-well dish on an orbital shaker at 80 rpm at room temperature.\nNote: Because tail skin hair shaft is shorter than dorsal skin hair shaft, no need to use shaver or depilatory cream to remove tail skin hair shaft on the skin surface.\nCritical: The development of tail skin hair follicles varies slightly in both anterior-posterior axis and in dorsal-ventral axis. For the purpose of experimental consistency, only the middle one third of the tail from the center of the dorsal side was chosen for tail skin wholemount staining (Xu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nImmunofluorescent staining of tail skin\nTiming: 2 days\nNote: All subsequent staining procedures are carried out in 24-well plate, with the hair follicle side facing down in the well. For all incubation process, the plate is kept on an orbital shaker at 80 rpm. To change medium in the 24-well plate, use P1000 pipette to carefully remove and add solution, while avoid touching the tissue in the well.",
    "To permeabilize skin sample, incubate tissues in 1 mL 0.3% TritonX-100 in 1× PBS for 10–20 min.\nIncubate the epidermis with attached hair follicles in 1 mL blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate the epidermis with attached hair follicles with primary antibody (diluted in blocking solution) overnight (∼16 h) at 4°C. Put one piece of tail skin in one well containing ∼300 μL solution. Goat anti-Pcad 1:1000. Rabbit anti-cleaved-caspase3 1:1000.\nWash samples with 1 mL 1× PBS for 3 × 20 min at room temperature.\nIncubate samples with secondary antibody and 1 μg/mL DAPI (diluted in ∼300 μL blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. Donkey anti Goat Cy3 1: 1000. Donkey anti Rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 1:1000. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nWash samples with 1× PBS for 3 × 20 min at room temperature.\nNext depending on the purpose of the experiment, removing unwanted hair follicles might be needed. For our study (Xie et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]), we intended to study catagen-telogen hair follicles. In this case, the long anagen hair follicles will obscure the view of neighboring catagen-telogen hair follicles that are much shorter. So before mounting and imaging, use fine-tipped tweezers to remove anagen hair follicles one by one. Under stereo microscope, different stage hair follicles can be clearly distinguished by their length and morphological differences. Detailed representative images are provided in the expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] below.\nPlace the tissue on the slide with the side of hair follicle facing the coverslip. Mount the tissue with 50% glycerol (diluted in PBS) with 1 μg/mL DAPI.\nApply coverslip and seal the edges with copious amount of clear nail polish.",
    "Note: In our experience no spacer is needed to preserve the 3-D structure of the hair follicle because the epidermis with attached hair follicles is not of significant thickness. We routinely add 50 μl mounting buffer for each 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm epidermis wholemount tissue, this amount of mounting buffer is sufficient to support the coverslip without it crushing the tissue. But for full thickness skin wholemount staining, which contains both epidermis and dermis, a spacer is needed to support the coverslip. In that case, we use Dow Corning High Vacuum Lubricant to circle the tissue and provide support for the cover slip.\nNote: Only use clear colorless nail polish to seal the edge of coverslip and avoid applying the nail polish on top of the skin samples.\nPart B. Intravital calcium imaging\nTamoxifen induction for live imaging in vivo\nTiming: 7 days\nPrepare tamoxifen for intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at 10 mg/mL in 100% sunflower oil. Heat the solution to 37°C, vortex at 200 for 30 min to dissolve tamoxifen in solution. Use immediately after preparation.\nAt postnatal day 11, inject Sox9creERT2; GCaMP6s; Ai14 mice intraperitoneally with tamoxifen at dosage of 40 μg/g body weight for 3 consecutive days. This allows the inducible GCaMP6s and tdTomato expression in HFSCs.\nAt postnatal day 18, the mice are ready for live imaging in vivo.\nNote: We chose this time point because we were analyzing catagen-telogen hair follicles in our study. Since using this genetic labeling strategy, HFSCs and their progenies will continue to express GCaMP6s and tdTomato for the lifetime of the animal, so long term intravital imaging can be carried out at any time points after tamoxifen induction. Specific observation time points should be determined for specific scientific questions.\nIntravital imaging of calcium signal in tail hair follicle",
    "Timing: 2 h\nAnesthetize mouse using isoflurane (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1491-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mouse immobilization for live imaging in vivo\n(A) Sox9creERT2; GCaMP6s; Ai14 mice used for calcium imaging and tamoxifen injection timeframe.\n(B) The custom table consisting of Anesthesia System and Temperature Controller.\n(C) A zoom-in picture of tail and microscopic lens. Around the imaging area of tail skin, use tapes to immobilize the tail skin to avoid the movement caused by mouse breath.\nPrepare the imaging station by immobilizing a 15 × 25 cm heating plate of the Temperature Controller on the microscopic table. For the duration of the imaging process, temperature of the heating plate is set at 37°C.\nImmobilize the breathing apparatus of an Anesthesia System by tapes on one side of the heating plate.\nAfter putting the anesthetized mouse nostril inside the breathing apparatus of the Anesthesia System, immobilize the mouse tail by tape on the heating plate, ready for imaging (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Around the imaging area of tail skin, use extra tapes to stabilize the tail skin and minimize movement during the imaging process. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nAdjust microscopic lens to be positioned just above the intended imaging skin area.\nPerform Ca2+ imaging using a Nikon 2-photon microscope with a 25× water-immersion objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.02 (Olympus, UIS2) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) (Pineda et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Xu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nTo image GCaMP6s signals, tune the laser to the 910 nm wavelength with 40% intensity (Dana et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). To image tdTomato signals, tune the laser to the 1,040 nm wavelength with 10% intensity. GCaMP6s intensity represents calcium signal, and tdTomato provides stable internal control used to calculate calcium signal.\nNote: The appropriate laser intensity depends on the specific experiment and microscope, so it should be adjusted accordingly.",
