Press ok on the message that appears (Supplementary File 1-Figure S2).\nWait for a new menu to appear on the left side of the screen. Click on the Threshold Effect icon.",
    "Move the bar in the lower box until only the bone is painted in the images on the right. In this way, select the value of the Hounsfield units to be included in the model.\nOnce the desired paint level is achieved, click on Apply. The selection is marked with the color green (Supplementary File 1-Figure S3).\nSelect the option Make Model Effect from the side menu (the same as the previous one). Select Apply (Supplementary File 1-Figure S4).\nIn the upper-right window, the 3D model is generated. Click on the golden frame, Center the 3D view on the scene, to center the image in the center of the window (Supplementary File 1-Figure S4).\nSave the biomodel (Supplementary File 1-Figure S5).\n\t\nClick on Save in the upper-left margin.\nIn the box that appears, only select the file \"tissue\" (Supplementary File 1-Figure S5).\nIn the second column, in the dropdown menu, select STL.\nIn the third column, in the dropdown menu, choose where to save ithe STL file. Click on Save. This is the file that will be used in the following steps.\n3. Preparation of the biomodel\nDownload the MeshMixer software (see the Table of Materials). Install the program on the computer.\n\t\nImport the STL image by selecting the Import option in the center of the screen (Supplementary File 1-Figure S6).\nSelect the biomodel.\n\t\nLook for the Select option in the menu on the left side. Use any of the following main methods to select.",
    "Use the Select tool, select the thickness of the brush, and double-click on the femur (Supplementary File 1-Figure S7). If it is not possible to separate only the femur, it means that it has direct contact with other bone structures or soft parts; in that case, select Edit | Generate face Groups from the menu (Supplementary File 1-Figure S7). Use the Angle Threshold option and move the bar until the different structures have a different color, indicating that the pieces have been recognized as separate (Supplementary File 1-Figure S8).\n\t\t\nWith the Select tool, hold down the left mouse button while painting the part of the biomodel of interest.\nWith the Select tool, click on a point outside the model, and hold down the left mouse button while painting a circle that includes the part that is of interest.\nUse the Select tool to select the part of interest. Look for the option Select | Modify | Invert in the side menu, and press Delete (Supplementary File 1-Figure S9) to delete the unselected parts. At this juncture, the biomodel of the clean femur is obtained (Supplementary File 1-Figure S9).\nMake the model solid (Supplementary File 1-Figure S10).\nNavigate to Edit | Make Solid | Solid Type| Accurate.\nMaximize the Solid Accuracy and Mesh Density values.\nSave the biomodel. Select the Export option from the side menu. Select the STL format and the folder to which the biomodel is exported.\n4. Calculation of the proximal femoral anteversion\nDownload the 3D Builder software (see the Table of Materials). Install the program on the computer.\n\tNOTE: The program can only be downloaded if the operating system of the computer is Windows.",
    "Click on the Insert icon at the top of the screen (Supplementary File 1-Figure S11). Click on Add to import the biomodel to the scene (Supplementary File 1-Figure S12).\n\tNOTE: The left mouse button makes it possible to rotate the object to see it in a 360° view. With the right button, it is possible to scroll along the object. The central wheel of the mouse allows for zooming in.\nClick on Object | Settle to fix the object to the work plane so that it rests on the femoral condyles and the trochanter mayor.\n\tNOTE: It is advisable to put the object vertically parallel to the y-axis and perpendicular to the x-axis marked on the working plane (Supplementary File 1-Figure S13).\nPerform the femoral osteotomy.\n\t\nClick on Edit | Split from the top menu . When a rectangular cut plane appears, select Keep Both (Supplementary File 1-Figure S14).\n\t\t\nUse the Move Mode button on the bar in the lower margin of the screen to move the cutting plane horizontally and vertically.\nUse the Rotate Mode button on the bar in the lower margin of the screen to rotate the plane around the femur (Roll: 90°, Pitch: 0°, Yaw: 0°) (Supplementary File 1-Figure S14).\nPut the cutting plane parallel to the x-axis and perpendicular to the y-axis. Click on Split. In this case, perform the osteotomy above the trochanter minor (intertrochanteric) (Supplementary File 1-Figure S15).\nCalculate the femoral anteversion.\n\t\nInsert the guides, which help to establish the reference points to measure the femoral anteversion in the image in the 3D environment of the program according to Murphy's method (Supplementary File 1-Figure S16A,B). To insert the guides, click on Insert | Add, and choose the 3mf Supplementary File 2.",
    "NOTE: These guides were designed in-house, and the 3mf file Supplementary File 2 is accessible as a supplementary material provided in this article. The Murphy 3D method was implemented by establishing three measurement points in the same way as in the conventional method11 but in a 3D environment. The usual circumference at the level of the femoral head was replaced by a sphere, and the measurement was established by a circumference at the level of the trochanter minor. As a distal reference, the posterior intercondylar line was taken, as defined in the original Murphy method.\nSelect only the proximal part of the femur on the right side of the screen and click on CTRL + X to cut the selection. This is how the femoral diaphysis appears (Supplementary File 1-Figure S17).\nSelect the red circular guide and the purple circular guide (doing this means that they will be together) on the right side of the screen. Use the commands in the bottom margin panel to move the guides.\n\t\tNOTE: The red guide represents the rotational axis of the osteotomy, while the violet guide represents the rotational axis of the femur.\nPut the guides in the center of the femoral diaphysis, and use the commands of the inferior margin panel to adjust the size. Ensure that all the edges touch the cortex of the bone (Supplementary File 1-Figure S18).\n\t\tNOTE: When the two guides, the red circumference and the purple circumference, are used for the first time, they are selected together so that they move as a block, as if they were one guide, to measure the FAV, and they are placed in the femoral diaphysis just above the lesser trochanter at the osteotomy line.\nClick on CTRL + V to paste the proximal femur again (Supplementary File 1-Figure S19).",
    "Select only the sphere on the right side of the screen. Use the commands in the bottom margin panel to move the sphere and place it on top of the femoral head. Adjust the size, including all the edges touching the bone cortex (Supplementary File 1-Figure S20).\nSelect the proximal femur on the right side, and cut it (CTRL + X).\nSelect only the red plane on the right side of the screen (Supplementary File 1-Figure S21).\nUse the commands in the lower margin panel to move the red plane, and place it so that it passes through the center of the sphere and through the center of the circular guides.\n\t\tNOTE: The grades marked by the panel in the lower margin correspond to the pathological femoral anteversion calculated on the CT using Murphy's method.\nPress CTRL + V to paste the proximal femur again (Supplementary File 1-Figure S22 A,B) .\nPerform the rotational osteotomy of the proximal femur.\n\t\nSelect the proximal femur + the red circumference (only the red) + the sphere on the right side.\nMake an internal derotational proximal femoral osteotomy of 20° (use the commands on the panel of the lower margin; add 20 on Pitch) (Supplementary File 1-Figure S23).\nMeasure the new femoral anteversion (Supplementary File 1-Figure S24).\n\t\tNOTE: The two guides are used again to perform the osteotomy. In this case, only the red guide is selected together with the proximal femur (so that when the proximal femur rotates, the red guide also rotates; step 4.6.1), while the violet guide is not selected (Supplementary File 1-Figure S25). In this way, the violet guide remains in the femoral diaphysis and does not participate in the rotation of the proximal femur.",
    "Select the proximal femur + the red circumference, and press CTRL + X to cut these two elements.\nSelect only the red plane, and place it so that it passes through the center of the sphere and through the center of the purple circular guide.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A 1:1 relationship between the magnitude of the osteotomy and the correction of the deformity is not achieved because the derotation of the proximal femur does not follow the anatomical axis of the femur.\nPerform the adjustment of the rotational osteotomy.\n\t\nSelect the femoral diaphysis + the red plane. Press CTRL + X to cut (Figure 27). (Supplementary File 1-Figure S25).\nSelect the proximal femur + the sphere + the red circumference.\nMove the three elements en bloc so that the center of the red circumference matches the center of the purple circumference (Supplementary File 1-Figure S26).\nRecalculate the new femoral anteversion with the adjustment made (Supplementary File 1-Figure S27).\n\t\tNOTE: Through this 3D method, it is shown that the rotation axis of the femur and the rotation axis of the osteotomy do not coincide. For this reason, it is necessary to make an adjustment that involves realigning the two guides so that the original femoral axis and the osteotomy axis coincide.\nSubscription Required.
