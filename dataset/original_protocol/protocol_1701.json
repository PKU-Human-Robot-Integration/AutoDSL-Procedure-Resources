Follow manufacturer instructions with adaptations as below:\nLysis.\nMix solid samples in collection tubes with a sterile spatula.\nPlace approximately 0.25 g of solid sample in a bead tube with 800 μL lysis buffer.\nFor liquid samples, use 200 μL of sample with 600 μL lysis buffer.\nHeat tubes at 65°C for 10 min, using a water bath or heat block.\nNote: Heating will aid disassembly of the phage capsid and the release of genetic material.\nUsing a vortex adapter, vortex tubes for 10 min at maximum speed.\nInhibitor removal and washing (as specified in manufacturer instructions)\nElution.\nUse 60 μL of elution buffer and incubate spin column at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 10 min.\n. Centrifuge at 13,000 ×g for 1 min.\n. Once eluted, pass the same 60 μL eluate back through the same spin column (without incubation) and repeat centrifugation.\nMeasure DNA concentration by UV spectrophotometry.\nStore DNA at −20°C until analysis.\nRECOMMENDED: Use of filter tips when processing microbiome samples.\nAmplification of Lak phage structural protein-coding genes by PCR\nTiming: 1 h 30 min",
    "Amplification of Lak phage major capsid protein (MCP), portal vertex protein (PVP) and tail sheath monomer (TSM) gene fragments can be used for detection of Lak phages in biological samples. These signature genes were selected from metagenomic datasets, due to their specificity and conservation across Lak phage genomes. The general screening primers are specific to Lak phages found in humans, primates, pigs and most other animals. An additional set was designed to detect the divergent ∼660 kbp variant discovered in a racehorse microbiome (Crisci et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nOn ice, prepare master mixes for each assay containing the following:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1287_4.csv\nCalculate required volume of DNA to achieve 150 ng/μL in 25 μL.\nCalculate required volume of nuclease-free water (e.g., 19.25 μL – DNA volume).\nOn ice, prepare 25 μL PCR reaction:\nAdd water and DNA.\nAdd 5.5 μL pre-prepared master mix.\nAdd 0.25 μL Taq DNA Polymerase (1.25 U; BIOTAQTM DNA Polymerase, Bioline, London, UK).\nNote: Although this protocol has been validated with BIOTAQTM DNA Polymerase, users may adapt for other DNA polymerases or master mixes.\nCentrifuge briefly, and place in a thermocycler programmed under the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1287_5.csv\nEndpoint analysis of PCR products\nTiming: 2 h\nPresence of Lak phage in microbiome DNA can be visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis.\nPurified PCR products can be sequenced for confirmation and comparison. We recommend using either QIAquick PCR purification or gel extraction kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) prior to sequencing. To maximise yield, follow manufacturer instructions with adaptations as below:\nUse 30 μL of elution buffer and incubate spin column at room temperature for 10 min.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 ×g for 1 min.\nOnce eluted, pass the same 30 μL eluate back through the same spin column (without incubation) and repeat centrifugation.",
    "Measure DNA concentration by UV spectrophotometry.\nCritical: PCR purification of Lak MCP gene amplicons is a prerequisite in generating standards for the following qPCR assay.\nqPCR quantification of Lak phage major capsid protein-coding gene\nThis protocol has been validated for use with the QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and PikoRealTM real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) (Crisci et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). However, the following procedure can be adapted for any SYBR green-based qPCR kit and compatible instrument. As Lak phage genomes are generally AT-rich, the MCP gene was selected due to its conservation and higher GC content (∼41%) than other genes, which provides better thermal stability in qPCR reactions.\nCritical: The use of PCR product as qPCR standard is expected to yield an efficiency over 100% (Crisci et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Efficiencies between 90 and 110% are considered acceptable for quantification. It is advisable to calculate amplification efficiencies using standards and primers prior to qPCR quantification.\ne.g. (−1+10−1/slope) × 100\nPrepare standards for qPCR\nTiming: 30 min\nLak phage MCP gene amplicons (MCP: LakMC581-F/LakMC1053-R and MCP_660: LakHMC185-F/LakHMC984-R) are used as qPCR standards. The qPCR target regions are within the regions amplified by the endpoint PCR primers (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Once a PCR product is obtained, prepare qPCR standards as follows.\nPrepare 9 × 1:10 serial dilutions of PCR amplicon (starting at 5 ng).\nIn the first tube, adjust Lak major capsid PCR product to 5 ng/μL using nuclease-free water or 1× template dilution buffer.\nThen, add 2 μL from the first tube to 18 μL nuclease-free water or 1× template dilution buffer, mix by pipetting up and down, and discard the tip.\nRepeat for remaining serial dilutions. For example:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1287_6.csv\nPrepare DNA dilutions for qPCR\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Adjust sample DNA to 10 ng/μL using nuclease-free water or 1× template dilution buffer (so that 1 μL provides 10 ng DNA per 10 μL qPCR reaction).\nqPCR amplification\nTiming: 1 h\nPrepare master mixes for each assay containing the following:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1287_7.csv\n∗optional: ROX reference dye is used for normalization of fluorescence signals. ROX can be replaced with the same volume of nuclease-free water if not required.\nLoad 9 μL master mix into 96-well plates.\nLoad 1 μL diluted DNA:\nStandards (pre-prepared serial dilutions)\nSample DNA (10 ng per reaction)\nSeal plates with optical heat seals.\nProgram thermocycler according to kit instructions for quantification with SYBR green using the standard curve method.\nNote: A minimum of 3 technical replicates is recommended, along with use of no template controls (NTC; water in place of DNA). Melt curve analysis can be performed to identify non-specific binding.\nExtrapolate major capsid gene quantities (ng) from standard curves (quantification cycle (Cq) vs. Log DNA dilution).\nExtrapolated quantities (ng) can be analysed as is, or converted to copy numbers.\nNote: The MCP gene is single copy. Thus, gene copy number = genome copies."
