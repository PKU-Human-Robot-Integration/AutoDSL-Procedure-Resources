    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n96-well plate preparation\nTiming: 1 h\nBind your His6-tagged target protein onto a 96-well Ni-NTA plate for subsequent ADP-ribosylation.\nCritical: This assay was developed using His6-tagged target proteins chelated to Ni-NTA plates (QIAGEN), but could likely be easily adapted to other protein-tag and plate pairs.\nPrepare a 1 μM solution of the target protein in PBR.\nAdd 50 μL of the target protein solution to a Ni-NTA coated 96-well plate and incubate at RT for 1 h.\nNote: All incubation times, temperatures, and protein concentrations should be optimized for each target protein. The conditions given throughout this protocol have been effective for all target proteins tested to date but are not necessarily the optimal conditions for each PARP.\nEnzymatic reaction\nTiming: 1.5 h\nPARP enzymatic reaction with 6-alkyne-NAD+ in the presence of small-molecule inhibitors.\nPrepare a 4× solution of 6-alkyne-NAD+ at 0.4 mM. The final concentration of 6-alkyne-NAD+ is set at 100 μM to most accurately reflect the cellular concentration of NAD+, but can be adjusted to increase or decrease PARP activity or reflect a low NAD+ environment (Cambronne, et al. 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: While 6-alkyne-NAD+ was synthesized for this protocol, it is commercially available from Biolog Life Science Institute (Cat. No.: N 051-05).\nPrepare 4× solutions of inhibitors from 800× DMSO stocks, including a DMSO control, by adding 1 μL of the DMSO stock to 199 μL PBR.\nPrepare a 2× compound/6-alkyne-NAD+ solution by combining equal volumes of each 4× compound dilution and 4× 6-alkyne-NAD+ solution.\nPrepare a 2× solution of the PARP at 20 nM.\nCritical: Some PARPs require an activating cofactor, i.e., damaged DNA for PARP1 and PARP2 and 5′-nicked-dumbbell RNA for PARP3. These cofactors should be incorporated into the 2× protein stock.",
    "Note: Active PARPs show robust enzymatic activity at a final concentration of 10 nM, but we recommend measuring enzymatic activity at a range of concentrations before testing compounds to ensure consistency across different batches of protein.\nAlternatives: If conducting an auto-ADP-ribosylation assay where the PARP is being adhered to the plate, prepare a 2× stock of cofactors (if necessary) in PBR here instead of 2× PARP mix.\nRemove the target protein solution and wash plate 3× with 100 μL 1× PBST, 1× with 100 μL 1× PBS, and 1× with 100 μL PBR leaving each wash for ≥2 min at RT.\nPause Point: The plate can be left with 1× PBS for up to 1 h at RT, and up to 3 h at 4°C at any wash step throughout the assay.\nAdd 25 μL of 2× PARP solution to the 96-well plate followed by 25 μL of 2× compound/6-alkyne-NAD+.\nAlternatives: If an active PARP was chelated to the 96-well plate to assess auto-modification then replace the 2× PARP solution with an equal volume of PBR, being sure to include any activating cofactors.\nIncubate the plate at 30°C for 1 h.\nClick reaction\nTiming: 40 min\nReact biotin-N3 with the alkyne handle on 6-alkyne-ADP-ribose moieties now appended to the target protein on the plate.\nRemove the enzymatic reaction solution and wash the plate 3× with 100 μL 1× PBST and 1× with 100 μL 1× PBS, leaving each wash for ≥2 min at RT.\nAdd 50 μL click reaction solution (100 μM TBTA, 1 mM CuSO4, 100 μM biotin-N3, 2 mM TCEP, 1× PBS) to the 96-well plate.",
    "Critical: The click reaction solution must be prepared within 10 min of use and the TCEP must be added from an aqueous stock solution that is no more than 2 h old and has been kept on ice. The order of addition of the click reaction solution is critical, and must be: 1. TBTA, 2. CuSO4, 3. biotin-N3, 4. TCEP, 5. 1× PBS, and 6. DI water to the desired volume. Do not proceed with this step unless the complete click reaction solution progresses through the color changes depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. The solution should be light blue prior to TCEP addition, yellow-green post addition, and revert to a faint blue after PBS addition.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/486-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Expected color progression of click reaction solution\nTroubleshooting: if the complete click reaction solution is not faintly blue it is most likely due to an error in order of addition, insufficient mixing after each addition, or insufficiently potent TCEP solution.\nIncubate at 30°C for 30 min.\nBlock with 1% milk\nTiming: 40 min\nBlock with 1% milk to prevent non-specific Strep-HRP binding in the following step.\nRemove the click reaction solution and wash the plate 3× with 100 μL 1× PBST and 1× with 100 μL 1× PBS, leaving each wash for ≥2 min at RT.\nAdd 50 μL 1% milk in PBST to the 96-well plate.\nIncubate at RT for 30 min.\nStrep-HRP reaction\nTiming: 25–40 min\nAppend Strep-HRP to biotin for subsequent chemiluminescent visualization.\nRemove the milk block and wash the plate 3× with 100 μL 1× PBST and 1× with 100 μL 1× PBS, leaving each wash for ≥2 min at RT.\nAdd 50 μL Strep-HRP (300 ng/μL BSA, 0.5 ng/μL Strep-HRP, 1× PBS).\nIncubate at RT for 15–30 min.\nChemiluminescent reaction and readout\nTiming: 10 min",
    "Visualize the extent of ADP-ribosylation using QuantaRed Enhanced Chemifluorescent HRP substrate kit (Thermo).\nRemove the Strep-HRP and wash the plate 3× with 100 μL 1× PBST and 1× with 100 μL 1× PBS, leaving each wash for ≥2 min at RT.\nPrepare the QuantaRed solution per the instructions in the kit.\nCritical: Prepare the QuantaRed solution immediately before adding it to the plate.\nAdd 100 μL QuantaRed solution to each well and incubate for 30 s to 1 min then quench with the QuantaRed stop solution.\nNote: The solution will quickly turn pink in any wells where ADP-ribosylation has occurred and can over develop if left un-quenched for too long.\nPause Point: We recommend measuring luminescence on a plate reader directly after quenching the QuantaRed reaction, but we have compared readings at 5 min, 1 h, and 18 h and as long as the plate is covered to prevent evaporation the results remained consistent."
