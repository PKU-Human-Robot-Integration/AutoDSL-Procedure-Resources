    "PROCEDURE\ni) Fixation\nUniform fixation of thick samples, such as the whole brain, is imperative for large-scale quantitative 3D reconstructions. \n**1|** Anesthetize an adult \\(6–40 weeks old) mouse via intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital \\(Somnopentyl) \\(60 mg/kg body weight). \n**2|** Transcardially perfuse the animal with 20 ml of ice-cold HBSS supplemented with heparin \\(10 units/ml) in 1 min. The clearing of the liver indicates a good systemic perfusion.\n**3|** Transcardially perfuse the animal with 40 ml of ice-cold 4% \\(wt/vol) PFA/PBS\\(–) in 2 min. Care should be taken not to introduce air bubbles while transferring from HBSS to this fixative. The hardening of the liver indicates a good systemic fixation. \n**CAUTION** \nFreshly prepared 4% \\(wt/vol) PFA/PBS\\(–) should be used for efficient fixation. Check its pH prior to use. It should be neutral or slightly alkaline \\(pH 7.6–7.8). \n**CAUTION**\nThe perfusion flow rate should be not less than 20 ml/min for a rapid and uniform fixation. Slow perfusion may result in tissue autolysis due to post-mortem effects. \n**4|** Dissect out the brain and postfix it with 25–30 ml of 4% \\(wt/vol) PFA/PBS\\(–) \\(pH 7.6–7.8) for 8–72 hrs at 4 ºC with mild shaking. \n**5|** Store the sample in PBS\\(–) at 4 ºC until use but for not more than 1 week.\n**CRITICAL STEP**\nThe apparent fluorescence of the brain sample is reduced during postfixation, but can be recovered substantially after several hour incubation in PBS\\(–). At this stage, it is recommended that fluorescent pictures of the brain are taken using a fluorescence stereomicroscope for records. These images may be compared with those after deSca_l_ing for assessment of fluorescence preservation during treatments with Sca_l_eS0, Sca_l_eS1, Sca_l_eS2, and Sca_l_eS3. \nii) Clearing",
    "It may be hard to clear the whole brain of older mice \\(> 20 weeks old) across the pia mater. For older mice, it is recommended to split the brain into two pieces. For example, unless commissural connections are examined, cut the brain at mid-plane into two cerebral hemispheres. The following procedure assumes that the hemisphere or a 1–3-mm-thick slice of the mouse brain is processed as a sample to be cleared. The clearing procedure should be properly used according to the type of tissue to be cleared \\(**Table 2a–c**). \n**1|** Transfer the sample into Sca_l_eS0 solution in a centrifuge tube \\(**Figure 1a, b**), and incubate it at 37 ºC with gentle shaking \\(~70 rpm/min) \\(**Figure 3a**) for 12 hrs.\n**2|** Replace Sca_l_eS0 solution with Sca_l_eS1. Incubate the sample in Sca_l_eS1 at 37 ºC with gentle shaking \\(~70 rpm/min) \\(**Figure 3a**) for 12 hrs.\n**3|** Replace Sca_l_eS1 solution with Sca_l_eS2. Incubate the sample in Sca_l_eS2 at 37 ºC with gentle shaking \\(~70 rpm/min) \\(**Figure 3a**) for 12 hrs.\n**4|** Replace Sca_l_eS2 solution with Sca_l_eS3. Incubate the sample in Sca_l_eS3 at 37 ºC with gentle shaking \\(~70 rpm/min) \\(**Figure 3a**) for 12 hrs.\n**CRITICAL STEP** \nIt is important to use a container \\(see-through vial) where you can easily assess sample integrity and transparency. \n**CAUTION** \nMuch care should be taken not to damage or destroy the sample. Use a dispensing spoon to hold the tissue during solution replacement \\(**Figure 3b**). If the sample is fragile, decrease the shaking speed.\n**CAUTION** \nSpilled Triton X-100 may deteriorate the cap sealing of the centrifuge tube, leading to solution leakage during long hours of shaking. Wipe the solutions well off the cap screw.",
    "**5|** deSca_l_ing. Replace Sca_l_eS3 solution with PBS\\(–) and incubate the sample at 4 ºC for 6 hrs with gentle shaking \\(30–40 rpm/min) on the orbital shaker. \n**CRITICAL STEP** \nConfirm turbid appearance of the deSca_l_ed sample. It should look like it used to be before clearing. See i) step 5|. Take pictures of the sample using a fluorescence stereomicroscope under the same conditions as before. If the sample is not yet turbid, repeat deSca_l_ing with fresh PBS\\(–). \n**6|** Replace PBS\\(–) with Sca_l_eS4D25 and incubate the sample at 37 ºC with gentle shaking \\(~70 rpm/min) for 12 hrs \\(**Figure 3a**).\n**TROUBLESHOOTING** \nIf the sample cannot be clarified, prolong the incubation, refresh the incubation with new Sca_l_eS4D25, or do deSca_l_ing over again.  \n**PAUSE POINT** \nDeSca_l_ed samples can be kept at 4 ºC for a long period. The transparent sample can be stored in Sca_l_eS4D25 at 4 ºC for >1 year.\niii) Immobilization\nThe Sca_l_eS4D25-treated tissue floats in the mounting solution, such as Sca_l_eS4D25 and Sca_l_eS4D2.5, and needs to be immobilized in a container for high-resolution fluorescence observation. Here the sample is supposed to be immobilized onto a culture dish for epi-fluorescence observation using CLSM, which is common laboratory equipment. Also, the immobilization is designed for an upright microscope with dipping objectives that have long working distances \\(**Figure 1e**), and therefore requires a tall plastic dish. The following 2 methods assume an experiment, where the hemisphere or a 1–3-mm-thick slice of the YFP-H mouse brain is imaged deep for a high-resolution 3D reconstruction of YFP-expressing neurons. In many cases, furthermore, the experiment aims at wide imaging to generate such 3D reconstructions at multiple neighboring xy positions. Accordingly, the experiment usually spans several hours, and during the time period the sample must not move or expand/shrink. \n\\(1) Agarose method",
    "**1|** Melt 1.5–2.5% \\(wt/vol) agarose in Sca_l_eS4D25\\(0) using a microwave oven \\(500 W) for 4 min and cool down to 35–40 ºC.\n**2|** Place the sample on the bottom of a plastic cup \\(depth: 4–5 cm, diameter: 8–10 cm).\n**3|** Wipe up excessive Sca_l_eS4D25 solution around the sample with Kim Wipe \\(**Figure 4a**). Leave the sample in the air for 10–15 min at room temperature to lightly dry the sample surface.\n**4|** Drop the agarose solution on the top of the sample using a polyvinyl pipette. A mountain-like skirt of agarose is made that covers the entire sample \\(**Figure 4b**). \n**CAUTION** \nMuch care should be taken to verify that the agarose solution is cooled down enough. \n**5|** Leave the agarose skirt for hardening in the air for a few hours or in a refrigerator when in a hurry. \n**6|** Trim away the edges of the agarose skirt using a micro-spatula \\(**Figure 4c**). Remove the agarose fragments or debris completely by Kim Wipe \\(**Figure 4d**). Wipe out the cup surface with a wet Kim Wipe and leave it in the air for 5 min.\n**7|** Attach the rim of the agarose gel onto the cup surface by glue \\(Alon alpha A). Adhesion at multiple points is required \\(**Figure 4e**). Wait for approximately 10 min for complete fixation of the whole sample, which can be checked by slanting the cup. \n**8|** Gently pour an appropriate volume \\(1/4 vol of the cup capacity) of Sca_l_eS4D25 solution into the cup \\(**Figure 4f**).\n**TROUBLESHOOTING** \nIf the sample with agarose gel is detached from the cup bottom, move the sample to another cup and repeat the steps 1|–8|. \n**9|** Equilibrate the sample to Sca_l_eS4D25 by gentle shaking for 1 hr at room temperature \\(**Figure 4g**).",
    "**10|** Substitute fresh Sca_l_eS4D25 or Sca_l_eS4D2.5 solution for observation. This sample system with Sca_l_eS4D25 can be stored at 4 ºC for at least 2 months.\n**11|** Immerse a dipping objective lens in Sca_l_eS4D25 or Sca_l_eS4D2.5 and make it approach to the sample slowly \\(**Figure 4h**). \n**CAUTION** \nBefore objective immersion, check by eyes that there are no air bubbles on the sample surface. Bubbles can be eliminated by gently scraping the surface with the bubble-remover \\(**Figure 1c, 5a**). After objective immersion, check tiny air bubbles on the sample surface through the microscope and remove them by the bubble-remover. On the other hand, air bubbles trapped on the tip of the objective should be removed by the bubble-flusher \\(**Figure 1d, 5b**). \n**CAUTION** \nCLSM observation for a long time \\(> 12 hrs) results in water evaporation of the mounting medium. This is prevented by covering the surface of the medium with a thin plastic film made of saran \\(trade name Saran Wrap) \\(**Figure 5c**). \n\\(2) Parafilm method\n**1|** Place the sample on the bottom of a plastic cup \\(depth: 4–5 cm, diameter: 8–10 cm). \n**2|** Wipe up excessive Sca_l_eS4D25 solution around the sample with Kim Wipe. \nLeave the sample in the air for 10–15 min at room temperature to lightly dry the sample surface.\n**3|** Make a hole \\(diameter: 5–6 mm) on a Parafilm sheet \\(5–6 cm square).\n**4|** Put the Parafilm sheet over the sample while positioning the hole to the target area \\(**Figure 6a, b**). \n**CAUTION** \nMuch care should be taken not to damage the sample. \n**5|** Attach the hem of the Parafilm sheet and the bottom surface by glue \\(Alon alpha A). \n**6|** Gently pour an appropriate volume \\(1/4 vol of the cup capacity) of Sca_l_eS4D25 solution into the cup.",
    "**7|** Equilibrate the sample to Sca_l_eS4D25 by gentle shaking for 1 hr at room temperature.\n**8|** Substitute fresh Sca_l_eS4D25 or Sca_l_eS4D2.5 solution for observation. This sample system with Sca_l_eS4D25 can be stored at 4 ºC for at least 2 months.\n**9|** Immerse a dipping objective lens in Sca_l_eS4D25 or Sca_l_eS4D2.5 and make it approach to the sample slowly. \n**CAUTION** \nBefore objective immersion, check by eyes that there are no air bubbles on the sample surface. Bubbles can be eliminated by gently scraping the surface with the bubble-remover \\(**Figure 1c, 6c**). After objective immersion, check tiny air bubbles on the sample surface through microscopy and remove them by the bubble-remover. On the other hand, air bubbles trapped on the tip of the objective should be removed by the bubble-flusher \\(**Figure 5b**). \n**CAUTION** \nCLSM observation for a long time \\(> 12 hrs) results in water evaporation of the mounting medium. This is prevented by covering the surface of the medium with a thin plastic film made of saran \\(trade name Saran Wrap)."
