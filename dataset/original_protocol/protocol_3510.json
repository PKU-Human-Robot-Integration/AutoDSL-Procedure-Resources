    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPolyacrylamide hydrogels (PA gels) of tunable stiffness are first prepared on glass coverslips and the top surface of these hydrogels are functionalized and coated with ECM proteins. Cells cultured on these ECM-coated PA gels are used for AFM based stiffness measurement. The underlying ECM-coated PA gel mimics the bulk stiffness of the microenvironment and can be tuned accordingly using different concentrations of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide (Syed et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Tse and Engler, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). For our experiments, cells were grown on collagen-coated ~4.5 kPa PA gels and nuclear stiffness was measured by probing live cells in the culture media using an AFM cantilever. The PA gel stiffness can also be measured from the same sample by analyzing force curves obtained from a cell free zone of the PA gel.\nPreparation of collagen type I coated PA gels and cell seeding\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section of the protocol documents PA gel preparation, functionalization, ECM coating, and cell culture. PA gels prepared on coverslips are functionalized with Sulfo-SANPAH and coated with ECM protein prior to seeding cells. The accompanying Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] demonstrates the major steps for PA gel preparation and ECM coating.\nTake acid cleaned 12 mm or 18 mm coverslips (up to 30 coverslips per batch, depending on the number of gels to be prepared) in a large (100 mm or 150 mm) glass petri dish and rinse with UP water 2–3 times. After rinsing, aspirate the water using a vacuum pump for suctioning.\nCritical: Avoid using plastic Petri dishes in subsequent steps as APTES and glutaraldehyde used in steps 4 and 5 can erode plastic.",
    "Add 0.1 M NaOH solution onto the coverslips at room temperature (RT). After 20 min of incubation, wash coverslips/coverslides with UP water 2–3 times and then dry them carefully by placing between lint-free papers. After drying, put the coverslips/coverslides back into the large glass petri dish.\nNaOH treatment is important to achieve uniform spreading of gel solution on the coverslips\nAdd APTES onto dried coverslips; make sure that enough solution (2–5 mL) is added to cover all the coverslips. APTES activates the glass surface and provides free amine groups for further crosslinking.\nAfter 20 min of incubation, remove the APTES solution and then wash with UP water at least 3–4 times to ensure complete removal of unreacted free APTES. Glass coverslips/coverslides having excess unreacted APTES can react with glutaraldehyde to form orange-brown precipitates which can interfere with later microscopic techniques.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. A detailed video demonstrating polyacrylamide gel preparation and ECM coating for cell culture, related to steps 1–17\nCritical: APTES is corrosive, harmful, and can cause skin irritation. Wear protective gloves and goggles while handling it and follow other standard safety measures as per the manufacturer’s protocol.\nAdd 0.5% glutaraldehyde solution prepared in UP water onto APTES treated coverslips for 30 min. Make sure coverslips are completely immersed in the solution. As glutaraldehyde is light-sensitive, use aluminum foil to shield the coverslips from light.\nGlutaraldehyde acts a crosslinking agent which facilitates covalent bonding of gel to the glass surface.\nCritical: Glutaraldehyde is corrosive, toxic, harmful to health, and an environmental hazard. Wear gloves, goggles, and other protective equipment while handling it and follow other standard safety measures as per the manufacturer's protocol. It is recommended to dilute stock glutaraldehyde inside a fume hood (maintain sterility) to a working 0.5% solution.",
    "Remove the solution completely and then wash with UP water at least 3–4 times. Make sure there are no traces of glutaraldehyde.\nLay coverslips out on a lint-free tissue paper using forceps making sure that the functionalized surfaces face up. Gently dry with lint-free tissues. The coverslips are now functionalized and ready to be used for PA gel preparation.\nPrepare hydrophobic glass: Take acid cleaned glass slides (75 mm × 25 mm) on a glass petri dish, rinse with water then wipe with a lint-free tissue. Bring it inside the fume hood and put 100–200 μL of dichlorodimethylsilane on top of each slide and make a thin smear using another glass slide. Lay the treated glass slide on a paper towel with the hydrophobic surface facing up next to the functionalized coverslip.\nCritical: Dichlorodimethylsilane is flammable, corrosive, and toxic. Hence follow standard safety measures as per the manufacturer's protocol while handling it.\nAliquot required amount of Acrylamide/bis-acrylamide stock solution in a 1.5 mL tube and add 1/1000 volume TEMED and 1/100 volume 10% APS solution (for example, add 1 μL TEMED and 10 μL APS solution for 1 mL stock Acrylamide/bis-acrylamide solution). Mix the solutions using a pipette avoiding formation of air bubbles.\nQuickly pipette the mixture as small droplets on top of the hydrophobic glass slide and overlay the functionalized coverslips using forceps. The functionalized surface of the coverslip should be in contact with the solution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], Methods video 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]) While pipetting small droplets, dispense 10 μL solution/cm2 area to prepare ~80 μm thick gels (for example, dispense 8.9 μL droplets for 12 mm coverslip and 20 μL droplets for 18 mm coverslip).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/430-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. ECM-coated polyacrylamide gel (PA gel) preparation and cell seeding",
    "(A–C) Polyacrylamide gel preparation picture (A) and schematic from different angles (B and C). Gel cocktail droplets are pipetted on top of a clean hydrophobic (dichlorodimethylsilane treated) glass slide and then functionalized glass coverslips were overplayed on top in such a way that the functionalized side faces the droplet.\n(D and E) Once polymerized, gels are transferred to 24-well plates (D) and then coated with ECM protein overnight after functionalization (E).\n(F) Cells are seeded on the gels after removing excess ECM protein solution.\nAllow the solution to polymerize for 20–30 min to form gels. Check the leftover solution in the tube to see if the polymerization is complete.\nAfter polymerization is complete, slide off the gels from the hydrophobic slide gently using forceps and put them in separate wells in a TC culture plate (12 mm coverslips in 24 well plate and 18 mm coverslips in 12 well plate) immersed in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.5). Make sure the polymerized gels are facing up (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2E).\nNote: The gels can be stored for 14 days submerged in HEPES at 4°C. In such a case 0.5% sodium azide can be added to prevent contamination. If stored in 0.5% sodium azide HEPES, then the gels have to be cleaned 3–4 times with HEPES buffer (sodium azide free) before ECM coating to remove residual azide that might interfere with cell culture.\nPrepare 0.5 mg/mL Sulfo-SANPAH working solution in 50 mM sterile HEPES buffer (pH 8.5) from 0.1 mg/μL stock (add 5 μL Sulfo-SANPAH stock solution per every 1 mL HEPES). The working solution can also be filtered through a 0.22 μm syringe filter.\nNote: Do not store the diluted solution and prepare it fresh from stock immediately before the ECM coating step.",
    "Aspirate HEPES from the wells containing gels and add Sulfo-SANPAH working solution (per well ~300 μL for 24 well plate, ~600 μL for 12 well plate). Make sure the gels are fully covered with sulfo-SANPAH.\nNote: Be careful while aspirating buffers and other treatment reagents from wells containing gels. Tilt the plate and aspirate liquids using an aspirator or pipette from one side and avoid touching the gel with the aspirator/pipette tips as this might damage the surface.\nAfter adding Sulfo-SANPAH, put the plates containing gels under λ365 nm UV lamp for 20 min inside a sterile place (preferably cell culture hood). Make sure plates are uncovered during UV treatment.\nAspirate Sulfo-SANPAH and then carefully wash 3 times with 50 mM sterile HEPES buffer (pH 8.5).\nDilute preferred ECM protein stock in an appropriate buffer in a sterile tube. Aspirate HEPES buffer entirely from the plate after final wash and add ECM protein (~300 μL/well for 24-well plate and ~600 μL/well for 12-well plate) and incubate overnight at 4°C or 2.5 h at 37°C.\nNote: For our experiment, we have used collagen as ECM protein to coat the PA gels. We dilute Collagen Type I stock solution (Sigma, Cat# C3867) to a working concentration of 33.3 μg/mL in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS). We added 300 μL of this diluted collagen solution to each well in a 24-well plate (growth area ~ 2 cm2) to obtain an effective collagen coating of 5 μg/cm2.\nAfter incubation, aspirate ECM solution, wash 2 times with DPBS and then add complete cell culture media for stabilizing the gels at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 0.5–1 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).",
    "After incubation with complete media, seed cells at the desired seeding density from a 60%–70% confluent cell culture plate. Make sure cells are healthy before seeding them on gels.\nNote: For single-cell nuclear stiffness measurements, it is important to have a seeding density such that sufficient numbers of single cells can be measured. Excess cell seeding might result in a confluent or semi-confluent layer with very few single cells that can be probed. For MDA-MB-231 and HT 1080 cells, use a seeding density of 3,000–6,000 cells/cm2.\nCulture cells seeded on PA gels for at least 12–24 h before doing AFM measurements.\nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements\nTiming: 30–90 min\nThis section of the protocol documents AFM setup process, AFM calibration, and cell stiffness measurement. The accompanying Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] demonstrates the major steps of this section including AFM probe attachment, AFM calibration, coverslip (with cells grown on PA gel) attachment and force curve recording process.\nWarm phenol red-free DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES buffer by incubating it in a 37°C water bath. While incubating, setup and calibrate the AFM instrument for measurement.",
    "AFM setup and calibration: (it is advised to operate the AFM instrument under the supervision of an experienced user). The AFM instrument and the accompanying software have to be set up and the probe has to be calibrated before force measurement. The standard control might vary based on the AFM manufacturer, model, and even the software version which are usually available in the user manuals. The aim at the end of this step is to set up the AFM for force measurement on samples (cells attached on culture plate) submerged in liquid media (culture media). In MPF-3D-BIO this can be done by selecting contact mode force measurement after attaching a liquid-protective membrane to the cantilever holder. The steps taken to set up the MPF-3D-BIO are described below:\nStart the AFM instrument and software: A detailed documentation about the software can be found in the MFP-3D SPM User Guide, Version 13, Revision: A-1715, Chapter- 3 (Asylum Research, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Start the AFM instrument and connected computer. Once the instrument is powered up, start the AR software and wait for the initialization. Once initialized, select contact mode force from the standard selection menu (mode master > force > contact mode force).",
    "Attaching liquid protective membrane to the cantilever holder: Remove the cantilever holder (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.d, Methods video 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]) from the AFM head and mount it to the stand (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.e) and remove if it has any old cantilever attached to it. Remove it from the stand and attach the Closed Cell Bellows black Viton (Fluid Cell Lite, part # 112.256.01, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.b) and O-Ring Membrane Threaded Clamp (Fluid Cell Lite, part # 112.491, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.c) using the Spanner Wrench (Fluid Cell Lite, part # 939.008, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.c) and the blue ball (Fluid Cell Lite, part # 290.146, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.c). The detailed attachment steps are given in the MFP-3D SPM User Guide, Version 13, Revision: A-1715, pp. 153–156 (Asylum Research, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/430-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "After attaching the protective membrane put the cantilever holder back into the stand. Attach the cantilever using forceps to the cantilever holder. Be careful not to damage the probe as it is very delicate. Check if the probe is sitting properly and carefully install the cantilever holder back to the AFM head. Make sure not to accidentally touch the probe with anything.\nNote: It is essential to use the right kind of probe during stiffness measurement. Using too soft or too stiff cantilever might produce an unexpected and wrong outcome. Since nuclear stiffness influences cell stiffness estimates, particularly for well spread cells (Vichare et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), it is preferable to probe cortical stiffness of cells using relatively soft cantilevers with spring constant . In comparison, to minimize the influence of cortical stiffness in estimating nuclear stiffness, stiffer cantilevers with spring constants is desirable. However, these values are also dependent on the type of cells we are probing. For example, for probing cortical stiffness of very soft cells such as embryonic stem cells, it is better to use soft cantilevers with spring constant (Sthanam et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). In comparison, stiffer cells such as fibroblasts may be probed with stiff probes (Solon et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nIn our experiments, to probe nuclear stiffness, we used a stiff silicon nitride cantilevers (BL-TR400PB, Olympus) which have two probes attached to each cantilever. The large probe (Spring constant: 0.02 N/m, Resonance frequency: 10 kHz ) is a softer probe that can be used to obtain cortical stiffness of the cell. We have used the smaller probe (Spring constant: 0.09 N/m, Resonance frequency: 32 kHz) to obtain nuclear stiffness. AFM probes should be stored inside a vacuum desiccator as humidity and dust affect the quality of the cantilevers.",
    "Laser alignment and setting zero deflection: After attaching the probe align the deflection laser using appropriate controls. Aligning the laser (SLD) spot in MPF-3D-BIO is achieved using the LDX and LDY thumb wheels that move the laser spot in the X and Y axis respectively. First, locate Sum and Deflection meter in the AR software, then bring the laser spot near the tip of the cantilever and finally do fine adjustment so that the Sum is highest (Sum signal displays the total reflected laser light) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Once the laser is aligned, set the deflection meter to zero using the Sum and Deflection meter (this moves the reflected laser beam to the center on the photodetector) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nThe thermal calibration of the probe will yield the accurate spring constant of the probe. We used the inbuild GetReal probe calibration method (Thermal tab in Master panel of the AR software) as the BL-TR400PB probe is listed as a standard probe in GetReal tab (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). If the used probe is not listed, the Custom Rectangular Probe option can be selected for the calibration if dimensions and estimated resonance frequency of the cantilever are known. The manual thermal capture method can also be used to obtain the spring constant of the probe. Calibration yields the inverse optical lever sensitivity (InvOLS) and Spring Constant of the AFM. Signal in the photo diode is recorded in Volts. InvOLS converts this voltage signal into distance.\nNote: The thermal calibration is to be performed when the cantilever is not touching anything, i.e., it is withdrawn from the substrate. The thermal capture method is used to obtain the cantilever's resonance frequency from which the software calculates the spring constant.",
    "Calculating InvOLS in liquid culture media: the InvOLS changes when the force measurement is done in a liquid medium. The InvOLS in liquid media can be calculated from a force plot on hard surface (culture disc) obtained in liquid media. To do so, place the AFM head upside down and carefully put a few droplets of cell culture media around the probe without touching the probe (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Fix a 60 mm Petri dish containing 4–5 mL liquid media on the stage using double-sided tape. Gently put the head back on to the base and slowly lower the head rotating the leg wheels. Once the cantilever is completely submerged into the liquid media re-align the laser (SLD) spot similarly as mentioned in step 22.d. After re-aligning, set up the force measurement parameter by going to the force tab (in the master panel) and set start dist 0 nm, force dist 2 μm, and velocity 2 μm/s. Now engage the tip and gradually bring the cantilever down by slowly rotating the front leg thumb wheel till it touches the surface indicated by a computer beep. Now rotate very slowly till the Z voltage reaches about 70 V in the Sum and Deflection meter. Be gentle and careful as lowering it too much might break the tip. Take a single force curve by clicking the single force button in the force tab. Now click on the force plot graph and select virtual deflection and check the fit that will re-calculate InvOLS for the liquid media. The AFM is now ready to be used for sample stiffness measurement.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/430-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. AFM positioning and cantilever calibration in liquid media\n(A) Liquid droplets are overlaid around the probe to reduce probe bending due to surface tension during gradual immersion in liquid media.",
    "(B) Plate containing culture media is attached to the sample stage using clear adhesive tape which will be used for probe calibration.\n(C and D) A picture (C) and a schematic (D) of the AFM head over the media containing the plate used for calibration in liquid media.\nCritical: Make sure the liquid media is not overflowing on top of the protective membrane as it might damage the AFM.\nNote: While submerging into the liquid media, soft cantilevers might bend slightly due to their impact with the media. In such cases, waiting for some time (2–5 min) before proceeding with the laser alignment and calibration steps might straighten the cantilever.\nFixing gels on a plate for AFM: Attach a small piece of double-sided tape in the middle of a 60 mm cell culture disc inside the culture hood. Take the cell culture plate out from the incubator inside the hood. Using sterile fine forceps, lift the PA gel coverslip on which cells are seeded, gently tap the bottom on a lint-free tissue, and fix the coverslip on to the disc with the adhesive tape. Then pour 5–6 mL with warm phenol red-free DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES buffer and take it to the AFM room for measurement (Methods video 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nMounting the cell culture disc: Withdraw the AFM probe from the surface and move up the head by rotating the thumbwheel. Very gently lift the AFM head and remove the media containing plate (from liquid InvOLS calibration, step 22.f), and fix the cell culture disc at the same place with double-sided tape. Now put the AFM head back to the base and slowly submerge the probe again by rotating the thumbwheel. Be careful not to touch the probe with anything and damage it.",
    "Critical: Make sure the liquid media is not overflowing on top of the protective membrane as it might damage the AFM. Using a pipette remove excess media from the plate if needed and then put the AFM head back.\nSetting up the acquisition parameters: Set the acquisition parameters accordingly. For our experiment, we used the following: force distance (i.e., indentation depth) as 10 μm, tip velocity as 3–5 μm/s, and trigger point as 2.0 V. While lower tip speeds lead to an increase in acquisition time and may cause cell rearrangements and/or change in cell position, higher tip speeds may cause damage to cells and also lead to fewer data-points.\nNote: The default trigger point is set 1.0 V for cortical stiffness measurement. For nuclear stiffness measurements, it is recommended to use a trigger point of 2.0 V. For soft nuclei, we recommend using a lower value (~1.5 V). 10 μm indentation depth is sufficient to indent the nucleus through the cortex as most of the cells, when attached to the substrate, have a relatively thin cortex on top of the nucleus (2–4 μm). Due to the same reason, only the first 0.5–1 μm indentation data are fit during cortical stiffness measurements.",
    "Positioning the AFM cantilever on top of the cell: Engage the cantilever and gradually lower the head till the cantilever reaches the sample (as the probe touches the surface is indicated by computer beep or change in Z voltage). Switch to the phase-contrast microscope eyepiece or camera to locate the probe. Move the whole base by rotating X-plate and Y-plate till the cantilever is visible in the eyepiece/camera. Now withdraw the cantilever from the surface and bring a cell nucleus below the cantilever using the sample X and Y position knobs. The X-plate and Y-plate move the whole base including the AFM head while the X and Y position knobs only move the sample plate.\nOnce the cantilever is positioned on top of the cell nucleus and all the parameters are set, take a single force curve by clicking the single force button on the master panel force tab. The obtained force curve is usually automatically saved within the assigned directory as a .ibw file (IGOR Pro binary wave file). Withdraw the tip from the surface and position it on top of the next cell nucleus by rotating X and Y position knobs and take a force curve again for the second cell. Repeat these steps for the desired number of nuclei (50–100 nuclei per condition). Occasionally, the cantilever might have to be moved up or down using the front leg thumb wheel.\nNote: It is recommended to complete the measurements of each sample within 10–15 min as cells might undergo morphological changes when long term measurements are done at room temperature. For a rather long-time measurement or temperature-sensitive cells, an AFM on-stage incubator should preferably be used.",
    "Optional: Force curves can also be recorded from a cell free part of the PA gel that can be analyzed to obtain PA gel stiffness (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video 2.

    "Saving the force curve: While doing single force measurements each obtained force curve is saved within the assigned directory as a .ibw file (IGOR Pro binary wave file). The .ibw files can later be opened using the AR software (Igor Pro) and other AFM data analysis software like AtomicJ (See analysis section). The data can be exported to other formats as well.\nData analysis to obtain stiffness\nThe obtained AFM force data can be analyzed using AtomicJ software: AtomicJ is an open-source software developed by Hermanowicz et al. (2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) that can be used for analysis of AFM force curves. We encourage the user to go through the published paper and documentation before analyzing data using this software. Below is a very short description of the analysis steps:\nOpen the software and click on the process force curve and maps button (gear icon) to open the processing assistant. Click the \"add\" button to add force curve (.ibw or .csv files, using .ibw file allows the software to automatically read some parameters like spring constant and tip sensitivity) and browse to the folder containing force curve data and select curves (multiple force curves can be selected at once).",
    "After selecting the force curve, click select the \"next\" button at the bottom to go to the processing assistant. Under the \"general\" tab, select a suitable batch name. For all the other parameters, we encourage the user to read the documentation first. We selected the parameters as follows: Processing as automatic, contact estimator as classical golden, Estimation method as Based on the contact model, Model fit as Classical (L2), Fit as Approach. In the model section, the appropriate model and the parameters are to be selected accordingly. We used a Pyramidal probe (cantilever) and the Half-angle was 35° (usually available from the cantilever manufacturer). Detailed documentation of all the different models offered in the AtomicJ software is available in the literature and the cited paper (Hermanowicz et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) and can help with accurate model selection. The pyramid model can be used for pyramidal probes like BL-TR400PB that was used in this protocol. The Poisson ratio for most adherent cells is set to 0.5 (MacKay and Kumar, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), however, it might vary in some cases (MacKay and Kumar, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Curve baseline degree can be used for baseline correction. In the calibration section, the Spring constant and Sensitivity (InvOLS) can be entered manually, or when the .ibw file is loaded, it can automatically be read from the file by clicking Read-in. Go to the \"advanced\" tab and click on the infinity symbol () in Max load and Max indent (Constrain parameters). Max indent can be changed if the indentation data are fit for a certain indentation depth (for example, 0.5–1 μm data are usually fit to get cell cortical stiffness (Das et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2])). However, for nuclear stiffness the entire indentation data are fit, i.e., Max indent is set to (). In the \"output\" tab, different graphs can be selected.",
    "Optional step (when multiple batches are to be analyzed all at once): After clicking on the Processing settings, click the “next” batch button to add the next batch and add parameters accordingly after adding the batch name.\nFinally, upon clicking the “finish” button, the software will analyze all the force curves and give you the results as two separate files. The \"processing result\" contains all the stiffness measurements, and can be saved as .csv or .tsv file from (from file > save as option or by clicking Cmd+s/Ctrl+s). The \"graphical result\" contains different graphs including indentation and data fit curves and can also be saved in different formats."
