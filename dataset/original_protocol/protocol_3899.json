    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nStable Integration of Transgene Cassettes into the AAVS1 Locus\nTiming: 4–6 weeks\nThese steps describe the targeting of a doxycycline-inducible vector coding for NGN2 or ASCL1-P2A-DLX2 into the AAVS1 locus of hPSCs.\nPreincubate 80% confluent hPSCs in StemMACS iPS-Brew supplemented with 10 μM RI for 1 h.\nIncubate cells with PBS supplemented with 50 mM EDTA for 10 min.\nAdd 3 mL StemMACS iPS-Brew per well and pipette up and down 4–7 times with a 1000 μl pipette to dissociate the cells.\nCount cells before centrifugation.\nPellet 3–4 million cells per nucleofection round at 1200 rcf for 3 min.\nAspirate medium as completely as possible, wait for 10 seconds and remove remaining traces of medium without disturbing the cell pellet.\nCritical: From this point, complete steps 7 to 11 within 5 min or less.\nAdd to each cell pellet a total of 5 μg plasmid DNA (0.5 μg TALEN left, 0.5 μG TALEN right, 4 μg AAVS1-APD or AAVS1-NGN2). Do not exceed 10 μl total volume of added DNA solution.\nAdd 100 μl nucleofection mix per condition and mix by pipetting up and down one time with a pipette provided with the nucleofection kit.\nTransfer to a cuvette with the same pipette. We use the NucleofectorTM II (Amaxa Biosystems) that comes with a uniform cuvette size.\nNucleofect using Program B-023.\nRemove cells from the cuvette using a pipette included in the nucleofection kit and transfer into Geltrex-coated 10 cm dishes containing 10 mL StemMACS iPS-Brew supplemented with 10 μM RI and 5 μM L755507.\nAfter 24 h, replace medium with fresh StemMACS iPS-Brew supplemented with 10 μM RI.\nFrom this point on, replace medium every other day. Leave RI in the medium until cells start forming colonies.",
    "Wait for small colonies to form that consist of 5–10 cells each. This is usually the case on day 2–3 post nucleofection.\nAt this stage, start to select for transgene integration by adding 0.3 μg/mL puromycin for 96 h. Change medium daily, puromycin has to be added freshly to StemMACS iPS-Brew before the medium change.\nExpected result: 10–50 puromycin-resistant colonies per 10 cm dish 2 weeks after nucleofection.\nPick colonies under sterile conditions using a 10 μl pipette tip. Scratch off a single colony and transfer it into a well of 96-well plate coated with Geltrex and containing 300 μl StemMACS iPS-Brew.\nCultivate candidate clones until colonies are large but still growing in a monolayer (4–7 days). Then dissociate cultures and plate them into fresh dishes. Save dissociated cells from each clone for DNA extraction and subsequent genotyping.\nFor genotyping of isolated clones perform two different PCRs:\nPCR 1 tests for the proper integration of the 5′ homology arm of the targeting vector and is performed with primers 1, 2 and 3. The expected outcome of PCR 1 is as follows:\nsingle 2 kb product: bi-allelic insertion\none 1.8 and 2 kb product: mono-allelic insertion\nsingle 1.8 kb product: no insertion\nPCR 2 tests for the integration of the 3′ homology arm and is performed with primers 4 and 5. Expected outcome for PCR 2:\nsingle 2.4 kb product: on-target insertion\nno product: no insertion of 3′ homology arm or off-target insertion\nFor both PCRs, use the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_85_6.csv\nSelect clones with validated genotype and expand them to obtain three 6-well plates with 80% confluency. Cryopreserve one well per cryovial to establish a master cell bank of 18 cryovials.\nPause Point: Cryopreserved stable hPSC lines can be stored for several years at a temperature of −150°C or below.",
    "Forward Programming of hPSCs into Neurons\nTiming: 11–12 days\nThis section covers the derivation of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons from AAVS1-transgenic hPSC lines that were generated in the previous steps.\nNote: The forward programming protocols for induced glutamatergic (iGlutNs) and induced GABAergic (iGABANs) neurons are very similar (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) with only minor differences as specified in the following steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/85-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic Representation of the Forward Programming Protocol\nDay −2: Dissociate 80% confluent NGN2- or APD-transgenic hPSCs with Accutase and seed them on Geltrex-coated 6-well plates at a density of 200,000 cells/well in StemMACS iPS-Brew supplemented with 10 μM RI (2 mL/well).\nAlternatives: Cells can be seeded on day −1 at a density of 600,000 cells/well.\nCritical: After thawing hPSCs and before the dissociation step on day −2 it is essential to keep them in culture for at least two passages to ensure that they are highly proliferative and free of differentiated cells.\nNote: To start bulk differentiation, at least 3x6-well plates per line are required. This should result in the generation of 25–40 x 106 neurons by day 8.\nDay −1: Change medium to StemMACS iPS-Brew (2 mL/well) without RI.\nDay 0: Change medium to neuronal induction medium (4 mL/well) supplemented with 2 μg/mL doxycycline (dox) to induce transgene expression. Dox remains in the medium from now on until cryopreservation on day 8 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/85-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Phase Contrast Pictures Showing Cultured Cells at Different Stages of the Forward Programming Protocol\n(A) hPSC culture before dox induction. Colonies should show no signs of differentiation.\n(B) Dox-induced cells at day 2. At this point cultures should have a confluency of 90%–100% and only consist of small cells with epithelial morphology.",
    "(C) Day 5 of dox-induction. iGlutN progenitors start showing neuronal morphology. iGABAN progenitors mostly remain arranged in colonies, and cultures show a noticeable decrease in cell density in comparison to day 2.\n(D) iGlutNs and iGABANs right before cryopreservation. At this stage, cultures exclusively contain neurite-bearing cells. Scale bar: 100 μm.\nDay 2: Dissociate cells with Accutase for 10 min at 37°C. Plate cells on PO/laminin-coated T175 flasks at a density of i) 10–15 x 106 cells/flask for the generation of glutamatergic neurons or ii) 20–25 x 106 cells/flask for iGABAN programming. At this point, change to neuronal medium supplemented with 2 μg/mL dox and 10 μM RI (30 mL/flask) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: Optimally, three T175 flasks per cell line should be seeded to obtain 25–40 x 106 neurons. Handling of more than 9 flasks in parallel is challenging and might impair batch quality.\nNote: During the conversion process iGlutNs typically show a higher survival rate compared to iGABAN cultures.\nDay 3: Medium change (dox-supplemented neuronal medium containing 10 μM DAPT; DAPT remains in the medium from day 3 until day 7).\nCritical: During medium change, cells should not dry out. Thus, always leave about 5 mL medium of the old medium in the flask. When performing a medium change, tilt the plate slowly so that the medium is accumulated at the corner of the flask, then slowly aspirate the medium.\nCritical: Never touch the bottom of the plate with the pipette tip and keep cells exposed to air as short as possible.\nNote: As neurons mature they become sensitive to mechanical stress and might start to detach. Thus, we suggest removing media with a pipette instead of a vacuum pump from day 5 onwards.\nDay 5: Medium change (dox-supplemented neuronal medium containing 10 μM DAPT) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Note: iGABAN conversion cultures might exhibit a significant fraction of dead cells between day 3 and day 5.\nDay 6: Medium change (dox-supplemented neuronal medium containing 10 μM DAPT, 5 μM Ara-C and 1:500 laminin). Ara-C will induce a growth arrest of remaining proliferative cells.\nDay 7: Medium change (dox-supplemented neuronal medium containing 1:500 laminin).\nDay 8: Culture dissociation and batch cryopreservation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: From our experience, for most hPSC lines one day of Ara-C treatment is enough to avoid the presence of proliferative cells. However, if at day 7 cultures still contain cells with non-neuronal morphology, an additional day of Ara-C treatment is recommended. In this case, cells can be cryopreserved on day 9.\nNote: In general, we found that freezing of neurons at an earlier time point (day 8) is advantageous for cell survival. Longer culturing times result in cell clustering as well as formation of longer processes that form a more complex network. Such cultures are harder to dissociate which presumably leads to reduced culture viability before cryopreservation. iGABAN cultures do not show complex networks or cell clusters and tolerate dissociation at day 9 without impacting cell survival.\nCryopreservation of Post-Mitotic Neurons\nTiming: 2–2.5 h per line\nThe following steps detail the cryopreservation of neurons that were derived as described in the previous section.\nGently wash cells with 20 mL DPBS. If the culture is about to detach (e.g. the cell layer is already lifted at the edges), skip this step.\nAdd pre-warmed Accutase supplemented with 10 μM RI (15 mL per T175 flask). Incubate for 60 min at 37°C, then check whether the cells are sufficiently dissociated. For doing so, gently tap the flask 3–4 times. If large clumps are still present, extend the incubation time to up to 90 min in total.",
    "Gently wash off the cells with 15 mL pre-warmed NBB27 medium, dissociate further by pipetting very gently 5–10 times up and down with a 25 mL pipette.\nTransfer cell suspension into a collection bottle.\nWash the flask again with 15 mL of medium to harvest remaining cells and transfer to the collection bottle. Pool cell suspensions that belong to the same line in one bottle.\nGently mix by swirling and distribute the cell suspension from the bottle into several 50 mL Falcon tubes. While transferring the suspension, pass through a 40 μm cell strainer to filter out clumps.\nNote: You can extract genomic DNA from cell material retained in the cell strainer for quality control assays such as mycoplasma tests and SNP karyotyping.\nDetermine total cell number in the flow-through fraction.\nCritical: Steps 35 and 36 should be performed as quickly as possible.\nCentrifuge Falcon tubes at 1200 rcf for 3 min, in the meantime count cell sample from step 34. Prepare required number of labeled cryovials. We recommend to freeze 1 x 106 cells per cryovial in 1 mL of freezing medium.\nAfter centrifugation remove supernatant, resuspend the pellet in the calculated amount of ice-cold freezing medium and aliquot quickly into cryovials. Cryovials should be stored at −20°C until this point and placed into a tube cooling module during the process of aliquoting.\nTransfer tubes into a freezing container and place them into a −80°C freezer without any delay. The cells should freeze with a rate of approximately −1°C per min.\nOn the next day, transfer cryovials to a −150°C or liquid nitrogen freezer for long-term storage.",
    "Note: We found it optimal to aliquot no more than 10–15 cryovials at once, so that freezing conditions are similar for all cryovials. In the following, we describe how to freeze 30 x 106 neurons. Before starting, we distribute cryovials into three plastic bags (ten cryovials per bag) and store them at −20°C. We also prepare 4 empty 50 mL Falcon tubes and an empty bottle for the cell suspension (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Once cells are collected into the bottle (steps 31 and 32), we distribute them equally into three 50 mL Falcon tubes (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B–4D) as detailed in step 33. During centrifugation, we determine cell number and prepare the first ten cryovials. For this, we place them into a tube cooling module and loosen the lids (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). After centrifugation, we remove supernatant from all three tubes (see step 36). We start with one of the tubes to resuspend the pellet with freezing medium, quickly aliquot the cells into 10 cryovials and transfer them to −80°C (steps 36 and 37). Then we repeat the same procedure to process the remaining pellets.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/85-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Suggested Cell Culture Hood Setup for the Cryopreservation of Neurons\nFigures show the setup before step 30 (A), before step 33 (B), at step 33 (C), before step 34 (D), and before step 36 (E).\nPause Point: We stored cryopreserved neurons for up to one year at −150°C without any noticeable effect on cell quality.\nValidation of the Batch: Thawing and Culturing Neurons\nTiming: 9 days\nThis step describes how to thaw cryopreserved neurons and how to keep them in culture for batch quality control.\nTake a cryovial with neurons from the −150°C freezer and place it immediately in a water bath at 37°C for 2.5–3 min.",
    "Remove the cryovial from the water bath shortly before its content is completely thawed, wipe dry, and spray with 70% ethanol.\nTransfer the content of the cryovial with a 5 mL pipette into a 15 mL tube.\nRinse the cryovial with 1 mL neuronal medium and add the medium dropwise to thawed cells in the 15 mL tube while carefully swirling to ensure gentle mixing.\nNote: The dropwise transition from freezing medium to culture medium leads to an increased cell viability.\nSlowly fill up the tube to a volume of 10 mL and mix carefully by swirling the tube.\nCollect a sample to determine the number of viable cells.\nSpin cells down at 1200 rcf for 4 min and determine cell number during centrifugation. Based on our experience, about 60%–70% of the cells should be viable.\nUse a 1 mL pipette to gently resuspend the pellet in dox-supplemented neuronal medium containing 1:500 laminin and 10 μM RI, then fill up using a 5 mL pipette to obtain the desired cell concentration and mix gently.\nSeed cells on previously prepared PO/laminin coated plates.\nNote: We found it convenient to use PO/laminin-coated ibidi 96-well plates. We recommend for these plates a neuronal cell density of 1 x 105 cells/well.\nPlace dishes into a CO2 incubator at 37°C and make sure that cells are equally distributed.\nOn the next day, change medium to neuronal medium pre-equilibrated in a CO2 incubator for 1–2 h, and supplemented with dox as well as 1:500 mL laminin (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/85-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Validation of Cryopreserved iGlutN and iGABAN Batches\n(A) iGlutN and iGABAN cultures one day after thawing. Cultures should not contain cell clusters or non-neuronal cells.",
    "(B) Validation staining of iGlutN and iGABAN cultures one week after thawing. The cells show prominent expression of TUBB3 and FOXG1. In iGABAN cultures most cells are GABA-positive while iGlutN cultures contain only occasional cells positive for GABA. Scale bar: 100 μm.\nNote: To avoid the formation of non-neuronal cells, additional days of dox treatment are required after thawing. We found that glutamatergic neurons should be supplemented with dox for at least one day after thawing, while GABAergic neurons require dox supplementation for at least one week after thawing.\nChange half of the medium every other day, use medium pre-equilibrated in a CO2 incubator for 1–2 h.\nBefore proceeding with immunofluorescence staining, keep cells in culture for at least one week (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B)."
