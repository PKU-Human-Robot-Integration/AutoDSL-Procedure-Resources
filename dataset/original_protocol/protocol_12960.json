    "1. Preparation of Culture Media, Semi-solid Agar and Biofilm plates, Pre-cultures\nMedium Preparation for Swarming and Sliding\n\t\nDissolve 2 g of Lenox Broth (LB) and 0.7 g of Agar-agar in 100 ml ion-exchanged water and autoclave for 20 min at 120 °C. Use small volumes (50-200 ml) to improve reproducibility between experiments.\nImmediately after sterilization, close the cap of the medium bottle to reduce evaporation and place in a 55 °C incubator for at least 2 hr.\nAfter the medium temperature has tempered to 55 °C, pour 20 ml agar LB medium into a 90 mm diameter polystyrene Petri dish under a laboratory sterile hood. For time-lapse experiments, pour 5 ml agar LB medium per 35 mm diameter polystyrene Petri dish.\nClose the petri dish immediately after pouring, stack no more than 4 plates on top of each other and let the agar medium solidify for at least 1 hr.\n2xSG Medium Preparation for Colony Biofilms\n\t\nDissolve 1.6 g of Nutrient Broth, 0.2 g of KCl, 0.05 g of MgSO47H2O, and 1.5 g of Agar-agar in 100 ml ion-exchanged water and autoclave for 20 min at 120 °C. Use small volumes (50-200 ml) to improve reproducibility between experiments.\nImmediately after sterilization, close the cap of the medium bottle to reduce evaporation and place the bottle in a 55 °C incubator for at least 2 hr.\nAfter the medium temperature has self-adjusted to 55 °C, add 0.1 ml filter sterilized 1M Ca(NO3)2 solution, 0.1 ml filter sterilized 100 mM MnCl2 solution, 0.1 ml filter sterilized 1 mM FeSO4 solution, and 0.5 ml sterile 20% glucose solution.\nIn a laboratory sterile hood, pour 20 ml agar 2x SG medium per 90 mm diameter polystyrene Petri dish. For time-lapse experiments, pour 5 ml agar LB medium per 35 mm diameter polystyrene Petri dish.",
    "Close the petri dish immediately after pouring, stack the plate on top of each other, but not more than 4 plates, and let the agar medium to solidify for at least 1 hr.\nPreparation of Starter Cultures\n\tNOTE: The B. subtilis 168, NCIB 3610 derivative strains used in the methods described below constitutively produce green- or red-fluorescence proteins and were described before8,27. Strains are stored routinely in the -80 °C freezer.\n\t\nInoculate starter cultures from -80 °C stocks in 3 ml LB medium and incubate overnight (16-18 hr) at 37 °C with horizontal shaking (225 rpm). Do not incubate the culture longer than 18 hr as wild isolates of B. subtilis are mostly prone to aggregate and form a biofilm in the test tube.\n2. Co-inoculation of Fluorescently Labelled Bacterial Strains for Surface Spreading\nDrying of Semi-solid Agar Plates for Swarming and Sliding of B. subtilis.\n\t\nDry agar plates for swarming and sliding for 20 min prior to inoculation. Dry plates uncovered in a laminar flow hood (see Figure 1).\n\t\tNOTE: Bacterial swarming and sliding depends on the dryness of the semi-solid agar medium. Insufficient drying allows water accumulation on the agar medium resulting in flagellum-mediated swimming. Prolonged drying time results in lack of swarming.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54752/54752fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental workflow. The common procedure is depicted in the figure, including preparation of the culturing medium, drying the plate, inoculation and fluorescence microscopy detection (from left to right).

    "Determine the optical densities of the overnight starter cultures at 600 nm and mix density normalized green- and red-fluorescent protein producing strains of B. subtilis NCIB 3610 or its Δhag derivative in a 1.5 ml reaction tube. For example, mix 100 μl of strain 1 with (100*[OD600 of overnight culture of strain 1]/[OD600 of overnight culture of strain 2]) μl of strain 2. Mildly vortex (3 sec at max speed) for homogenous distribution.\n\t\tNOTE: B. subtilis NCIB 3610 strains are inoculated to observe swarming, while their Δhag derivatives are used for sliding.\nSpot 2 μl of mixed culture on the middle of a pre-dried plate (see Figure 1) and further dry the plate for 10 min after inoculation.\nIncubate plates at 37 °C upright to allow excess moisture to condense on the lid and not on the agar surface.\n\t\tNOTE: Incubation time for B. subtilis swarming is typically between 8-16 hr. Generally, the edge of the swarm reaches the side of the 90 mm Petri dish in 8 hr. Sliding is a slower process and requires at least 16 to 42 hr of incubation. After 36 hr, the sliding front reaches the side of the 90 mm Petri dish.\nFor time-lapse experiments, place the 35 mm diameter Petri dishes in a preheated stage incubation chamber set at 37 °C. Ensure that the lid of the Petri dish remains removed throughout the duration of the experiment. Set the cover of the stage incubator to 40 °C to circumvent moisture formation on the top of the incubator.\n3. Co-inoculation of Fluorescently Labelled Bacterial Strains with Different Initial Cell Densities\nDrying of Agar Plates for Colony Biofilm Formation of B. subtilis.\n\t\nDry the plates for colony biofilm development without cover in a laminar flow hood for 15 min prior to inoculation.",
    "NOTE: Insufficient drying results in increased humidity and swimming or swarming may be possible29. Drying too long results in small biofilm colonies.\nPreparation of 10-fold Diluted Starter Cultures for Colony Biofilms\n\t\nMix 100 μl of green- and red-fluorescent protein producing overnight starter cultures of B. subtilis 168 in a 1.5 ml reaction tube and mildly vortex for homogenous distribution. Prepare 10-fold dilution series in LB medium.\nSpot 2 μl of non-diluted or 101, 102, 103, 104 diluted mixed cultures on the plate containing biofilm-inducing medium.\n\t\tNOTE: 6 to 9 biofilm colonies can be initiated on a single 90 mm Petri dish taking into account that the colonies are separated at equal distance from each other.\nIncubate plates at 30 °C upright to allow excess moisture to condense on the lid and not on the agar surface.\n\t\tNOTE: The incubation time for B. subtilis biofilm is between 1 to 3 days. Generally, the colony biofilm of B. subtilis reaches its average size and complex structure in 2 days.\nFor time-lapse experiments, place a single inoculum in the middle of a 35 mm diameter Petri dish and place the dish in a preheated stage incubation chamber set at 30 °C. Ensure that the top of the Petri dish remains removed throughout the duration of the experiment. Set the cover of the stage incubator to 35 °C to circumvent moisture formation on the top of the incubator.\n4. Fluorescent Microscopy Detection of Labelled Strains\nEquipment Description for Imaging.",
    "To detect surface colonization and fluorescence signal, use a motorized fluorescence stereo zoom microscope (see detailed list in Materials Table) equipped with a 0.5X PlanApo Objective, two LED Cold-light sources (one for fluorescence detection and one for the visible light), filter sets for GFP (excitation at 470/40 nm and emission at 525/50 nm) and mRFP (excitation at 572/25 nm and emission at 629/62 nm), and a high resolution monochrome camera.\nPerform image acquisition and processing with appropriate software available for the stereo zoom microscope including multichannel and time-lapse modules. For time lapse experiment, use a standard heating stage incubator mounted to the stereo zoom microscope with an adapter.\nImaging of Swarming and Sliding Expansion\n\t\nUse the lowest magnification to capture the biggest possible area of the 90 mm plate. Set the origin of inoculation (middle of the 90 mm Petri dish) to the corner of the visible field for monitoring radial bacterial expansion and fluorescence.\nAdjust optimal exposure time depending on the strength of the fluorescence signal.\n\t\tNOTE: For constitutively expressed fluorescence genes in B. subtilis, green- and red-fluorescence with 1.5 and 3 sec exposure times can be used, respectively. Additionally, 10 msec exposure time is appropriate for visible light.\nUse the magnification that allows the detection of the whole biofilm colony and adjust the colony in the middle of the field of view.\n\tNOTE: As for swarming and sliding expansions, the optimal exposure times to detect the fluorescence signals in the biofilm colonies depends on the expression level of the fluorescent protein coding genes. For the representative results below, green- and red-fluorescence was detected using 1 and 3 sec exposure intervals, respectively.\nFor time-lapse imaging, obtain images at certain intervals using constant exposure times.",
    "Save the fluorescence stereomicroscope recorded images in a file format that is recognized by ImageJ software for quantitative data analysis.\n5. Data Analysis\nTo analyze the area occupied by each differently labelled fluorescent strain, open the file of interest in ImageJ software expanded with a BioVoxxel plugin.\n\t\nWhen a window called \"Bio-Formats Import Options\" appears where only the options \"Open all series\" and \"Autoscale\" are selected, open the file by clicking \"OK\".\n\t\tNOTE: The files are displayed as a stack of three images, one for each channel used to record an image in the microscope (green-, red-fluorescence and bright-field images).\nSeparate the stack into individual channel images by selecting \"Image\" - \"Stacks\" - \"Stack to Images\" in the ImageJ control panel.\n\t\tNOTE: Images appear and are numbered as 1/3 (green channel), 2/3 (red channel) and 3/3 (bright-field). Here, the bright-field image is excluded from the analysis.\nTo analyze the images, transform each into an 8-bit image by selecting \"Image\" - \"Type\" - \"8-bit\".\nTo determine the occupied area in pixel2, reset the scale of the images using \"Analyze\" - \"Set Scale\". When a window pops up with different scale options, reset the scale by selecting \"Click to Remove Scale\". Check the option \"Global\" to remove the scale for all open images.\nTo remove the background, draw an oval area (region of interest, ROI) outside the fluorescent area using the \"Oval\" tool in the ImageJ control panel.\n\t\nTo ensure that the size of the background oval is the same for all analyzed images, add it to the ROI manager via the [t] character of the keyboard. A ROI Manager window comes up where the background oval ROI can be saved via \"More\" - \"Save\" options.",
    "If the background oval ROI is visible on the image, measure the intensity of the area by choosing \"Analyze\" - \"Measure\".\n\t\tNOTE: A results window appears where amongst others the mean fluorescence intensity is displayed in the column labelled \"Mean\".\nSubtract the value of the mean background fluorescence intensity from the image by unselecting the background oval ROI, clicking \"Process\" - \"Math\" - \"Subtract\" and inserting the measured value.\nApply a threshold to the image via the \"Image\" - \"Adjust\" - \"Threshold\" option. Select the method Otsu and black & white (B&W). Check the \"Dark background\" option and employ the threshold by clicking \"Apply\".\n\tNOTE: The image changes to a binary image where the area above the threshold is shown in white and that below the threshold is shown in black.\nSelect everything above the threshold via the \"Analyze\" - \"Analyze Particles\" option. In the window with the settings, keep the default options and keep the \"Display results\" and \"Summarize\" options checked. Click \"OK\" to display the summary in the results window and the display the occupied area in the column labelled \"Total Area\"."
