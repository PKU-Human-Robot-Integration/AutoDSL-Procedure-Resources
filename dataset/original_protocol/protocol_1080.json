    "<p><strong>Immobilization of engineered niche ligands&nbsp;on non-tissue culture plates</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>1. One day prior to the initiation of culture, combine&nbsp;of&nbsp;Notch&nbsp;antibodies&nbsp;(anti-Notch1 and anti-Notch2 antibodies,&nbsp;each at 10 micrograms/ml),&nbsp;or control&nbsp;antibody&nbsp;(Armenian Hamster IgG Isotype Control Antibody, also at&nbsp;20 micrograms/ml), together with either recombinant fibronectin fragment (5&nbsp;micrograms/ml, retronectin, FN-CH-296) or recombinant mouse VCAM-1/CD106 Fc Chimera (5&nbsp;micrograms/ml) to Ca+Mg+-free PBS. &nbsp;</p><p>2. Add&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;0.25&nbsp;ml ligand solution&nbsp;per well of a non-tissue culture plastic&nbsp;48-well plate&nbsp;(for other well formats,&nbsp;see suggested amount per well in Supplementary Table 2). Make sure the meniscus clears the well bottom. &nbsp;</p><p>3. Incubate plate overnight at 4°C.  &nbsp;</p><p>4. On the day of culture initiation, prepare enough serum-free media for the number and types of wells being plated (see Supplementary Tables 1 and&nbsp;2). &nbsp;</p><p>5. Aspirate ligand solution and add excess PBS one well at a time ensuring the well does not dry out. Repeat once. &nbsp;</p><p>6. Aspirate PBS from the well and add&nbsp;0.4&nbsp;ml&nbsp;of serum-free media&nbsp;per 48-well&nbsp;(reserving additional 0.1 ml volume&nbsp;for&nbsp;addition of cell suspension following sorting, below). (For other well formats,&nbsp;see&nbsp;suggested volumes in&nbsp;Supplementary Table&nbsp;2).  &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Isolation of VE-Cad+EPCR+CD61+&nbsp;hemogenic&nbsp;precursors for engineered culture conditions </strong> &nbsp;</p><p>*For additional&nbsp;sorting&nbsp;details, refer to&nbsp;our&nbsp;previously published&nbsp;methods&nbsp;article6.&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp;</p><p><u>AGM/P-Sp&nbsp;Dissection &nbsp;</u></p><p>1. Set up timed matings of C57BI6/J7&nbsp;(CD45.2)&nbsp;mice for generating embryonic tissues of the desired age. &nbsp;</p><p>2. Harvest embryos from pregnant females at 9.5 to 11.5 days post coitum (dpc), depending on the stage desired.  &nbsp;</p><p>3. Dissect the AGM&nbsp;(or for E9.5 embryos, the central portion of the embryo proper containing the para-aortic splanchnopleure/P-Sp)&nbsp;from the embryos&nbsp;on ice-cold PBS with 10% FBS,&nbsp;as previously described7, pooling embryos from&nbsp;litters at the equivalent developmental stage based on somite numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Collect the&nbsp;pooled&nbsp;P-Sp/AGM&nbsp;tissues in a 15ml conical tube containing 10 ml PBS with 10% FBS on ice. Gravity settle tissues and gently remove PBS/10%&nbsp;FBS. Add 1ml 0.25% collagenase. Place in a 37°C water bath for 25 min. &nbsp;</p><p>5. Add 1 ml of PBS/10% FBS.",
    "Pipette about 20-30 times with a 1 ml pipette tip to obtain a single cell suspension. Add an additional 8 ml of PBS/10% FBS and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp;</p><p><u>Sorting of VE-Cad+EPCR+CD61+ precursors  &nbsp;</u></p><p>1. Prepare the blocking buffer for antibody staining. Add 10&nbsp;micrograms/ml&nbsp;anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fc receptor (FcR) block) and 1&nbsp;microgram/mL DAPI (1 mg/ml&nbsp;stock in H2O) to 1&nbsp;ml&nbsp;PBS with 10% FBS. &nbsp;</p><p>2. Draw up in a 3&nbsp;ml&nbsp;syringe and pass through a 0.22-micron&nbsp;syringe filter to sterilize. Re-suspend the cell pellet from the dissociated murine embryonic tissues in 500&nbsp;microliters&nbsp;blocking buffer and incubate on ice for 5 min. &nbsp;</p><p>3. Prepare the antibody mix: Add 10&nbsp;microgram/ml FcR block to 1&nbsp;ml&nbsp;PBS with 10% FBS and 10&nbsp;microliters&nbsp;of each fluorochrome-conjugated antibody (see reagent list): VEcadherin-PECy7, EPCR-PerCP-eFluor710, and CD61-APC. Also prepare a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;antibody mix&nbsp;containing&nbsp;isotype controls&nbsp;antibodies&nbsp;(see reagent list)&nbsp;that will&nbsp;be used&nbsp;to stain&nbsp;a small fraction of AGM cells&nbsp;(~10%)&nbsp;for&nbsp;setting&nbsp;sorting&nbsp;gates.&nbsp;(Note: use a 1:100&nbsp;final&nbsp;dilution of antibodies unless otherwise indicated based on the manufacturer’s recommendations&nbsp;or according to titrations).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>4. Draw antibody mix into a 3 ml syringe and pass through a 0.22-micron&nbsp;syringe filter to sterilize. Add 0.5&nbsp;ml&nbsp;antibody mix to cell pellet in blocking buffer from above. Incubate on ice for at least 20&nbsp;minutes. &nbsp;</p><p>5. Wash the stained cells: Add 9&nbsp;ml&nbsp;PBS/10% FBS and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min, aspirate, and re-suspend the cell pellet in&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;ml&nbsp;PBS/10% FBS. &nbsp;</p><p>6. Remove cell clumps by pipetting the cell suspension through a 35-micron&nbsp;cell strainer cap on a 5 ml tube. Place on ice until FACS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>7. Perform fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) by first gating&nbsp;on&nbsp;SSC and FSC&nbsp;(using&nbsp;relatively broad gates&nbsp;for FSC-A, as embryonic hemogenic precursors tend to vary in&nbsp;size,&nbsp;and&nbsp;using&nbsp;FSC-W and SSC-W&nbsp;gates&nbsp;to exclude doublets; for sample gating,&nbsp;see6)&nbsp;and&nbsp;gating on&nbsp;live cells&nbsp;as&nbsp;DAPI&nbsp;negative. Gate on VE-Cadherin positive&nbsp;cells and then gate on&nbsp;the subset that is positive for both&nbsp;EPCR&nbsp;and&nbsp;CD61.&nbsp;Use isotype control and&nbsp;fluor-minus one (FMO)&nbsp;samples to set thresholds for gates.",
    "&nbsp;Set the sorting machine to the lowest flow rate of 1.0&nbsp;to minimize shear stress. Sort cells into a&nbsp;5ml&nbsp;tube containing&nbsp;cold&nbsp;PBS/10% FBS. &nbsp;</p><p>8. After sorting, centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 10 min, aspirate, and re-suspend the cell pellet&nbsp;in&nbsp;serum-free media (enough for 100&nbsp;microliters/48-well). Re-suspend approximately 1-2 embryo equivalent of&nbsp;sorted&nbsp;cells per 48-well (this may need to be adjusted based on the embryonic stage).&nbsp;</p><p>9. Add 100&nbsp;microliters&nbsp;of cells to each 48-well (from plate prepared for engineered niche culture), for a total volume of&nbsp;500&nbsp;microliters/well&nbsp;(or for other well formats, total volume indicated in Supplementary Table 2). &nbsp;</p><p>10. Culture cells for 6-7 days&nbsp;in a 37°C&nbsp;tissue culture incubator with 5% C02&nbsp;before harvesting for phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry and transplantation assays.&nbsp;During culture, colonies of&nbsp;highly&nbsp;motile, semi-adherent, dividing&nbsp;hematopoietic progeny should emerge&nbsp;(see Figure&nbsp;1 and Supplementary movie), but&nbsp;cells&nbsp;should not be confluent at the time of harvest. To harvest cells, pipette vigorously&nbsp;and scrape&nbsp;wells&nbsp;with pipette tip&nbsp;to remove all cells.&nbsp;Remove&nbsp;10% of cells&nbsp;for phenotyping,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;remaining 90%&nbsp;for transplantation&nbsp;or other secondary assays (such as CFU or lymphoid assays in secondary OP9 and OP9-Delta&nbsp;co-cultures8).&nbsp;General phenotyping and&nbsp;transplantation&nbsp;assays are described in our previously published protocol.6&nbsp;To ensure that all cells are harvested,&nbsp;a small volume of&nbsp;PBS/2% FBS&nbsp;can be used&nbsp;in an additional round of vigorous pipetting and added to the&nbsp;rest of the harvested cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"
