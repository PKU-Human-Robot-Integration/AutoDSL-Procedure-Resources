    "1. Formulation of siRNA Nanocarriers\nPrepare separate solutions of siRNA and mPEG-b-P(APNBMA) with equal volumes diluted in 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer at pH 6.0.\nAdd siRNA at a concentration of 32 µg/mL to 20 mM HEPES solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The siRNA was a non-targeted, universal negative control sequence; however, the siRNA can be designed to target any gene of interest.\nDissolve mPEG-b-P(APNBMA) polymers into a 20 mM HEPES solution. Add an appropriate amount of mPEG-b-P(APNBMA) to make a 220 µg/mL solution so that the N/P ratio (N, amine groups on mPEG-b-P(APNBMA); P, phosphate groups on siRNA) is 4.\n\t\tNOTE: The synthetic protocol for the mPEG-b-P(APNBMA) polymers is reported elsewhere30.\nAdd the mPEG-b-P(APNBMA) solution dropwise to an equal volume of the siRNA solution while gently mixing on a vortex machine. Continue to vortex for 30 s following polymer addition. Incubate the samples in the dark at room temperature for 30 min.\n2. Measuring siRNA Release Using Gel Electrophoresis\nFormulate the nanocarriers according to steps 1.1-1.2, and scale the volumes to accommodate the number of samples desired.\nMix the nanocarrier with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).\n\t\nPrepare a 1 mg/mL solution of SDS in water. Aliquot out the amount of SDS solution needed to produce solutions with an S/P ratio (S, sulfate groups on SDS; P, phosphate groups on siRNA) of 15.\n\t\tNOTE: If the polyplex solution contains 1 µg of siRNA, 13 µg of SDS must be added to achieve an S/P ratio of 15.\nAdd the SDS solution to each nanocarrier solution dropwise while gently mixing on a vortex machine. Continue to vortex for 30 s following SDS addition.\nCentrifuge the samples at 3,000 x g for 5 s. Incubate the samples in the dark at room temperature for 30 min.",
    "Calibrate and set a UV laser with a 365 nm filter to an intensity of 200 W/m. Ensure that the light intensity is measured from the location at which the bottom of the sample solution will be seated.\nLoad the nanocarrier/SDS solution into a glass chamber comprised of glass slides separated by a rubber gasket.\nPre-wash glass slides in a 7:3 (v/v) ethanol/water solution in water and dry completely. Cut a hole (~2 x 3 cm rectangle) into a rubber gasket. Place the rubber gasket onto a glass slide.\nPipette the nanocarrier/SDS solution onto the glass slide inside the hole of the rubber gasket. Load an excess of solution (20 µL in surplus) onto the glass slide while avoiding contact with the rubber gasket.\n\t\tNOTE: Some liquid will be lost during the subsequent steps.\nPlace the second glass slide on top of the slide-gasket. To avoid air bubble generation, place one end of the slide down first and then slowly lower the other end.\nAttach binder clips to each side of the glass chamber to hold it closed.\nIrradiate the samples for the desired length of time (e.g., 0-60 min) using the UV laser with a 365 nm filter at an intensity of 200 W/m. Remove the binder clips and open the chamber.\nPipette 25 µL of the irradiated nanocarrier/SDS samples into a microcentrifuge tube. Incubate the solutions in the dark at room temperature for 30 min.\nPrepare a 2 wt% agarose gel pre-stained with 0.5 µg/mL ethidium bromide in Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE) buffered solution according to standard protocols31. Prepare a loading buffer comprised of 3:7 (v/v) glycerol/water.\nAdd 5 µL of the loading buffer solution to 25 µL of each nanocarrier/SDS sample. Incubate the samples in the dark at room temperature for 10 min.",
    "Load 30 µL of each nanocarrier/SDS sample into the 2% agarose gel. Run the gel in the dark at 100 V for 30 min. Image the gel using a gel imaging system with ethidium bromide filters. Save the gel image files and proceed to step 2.10 for band intensity quantification. Ensure that the band intensities are bright enough to clearly visualize but not too bright that the signals are saturated.\nQuantify the band intensities using publicly available ImageJ software32.\nUsing the ROI tool of ImageJ, determine the fluorescence intensity of the free siRNA bands in each lane by drawing a rectangle around each band. Plot the intensity curves of each lane, and integrate the area under the curves by drawing a horizontal line across the intensity curves and clicking the tracing wand inside the enclosed areas.\nCompute the relative intensity of each lane by dividing the area under the curve of each sample by the area under the curve of the siRNA positive control (no mPEG-b-P(APNBMA) added and no SDS added). Report the percentage of siRNA released as the normalized band intensity of each sample.\n3. Measuring siRNA Release Using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)\nObtain siRNA labelled with a single fluorophore at the 5' end of the sense strand.\n\tNOTE: The siRNA can be purchased pre-annealed with the labels conjugated in the desired location. The fluorophore should be photo-stable and absorb/emit between 450 and 750 nm to avoid UV light quenching and energy transfer with mPEG-b-P(APNBMA).\nFormulate the nanocarriers according to steps 1.1-1.2 using the labelled siRNA. Scale the volumes to accommodate the number of samples desired.\nIncubate the solutions in SDS and irradiate for the desired length of time according to steps 2.2-2.6.\nPreparation of FCS sample chamber.",
    "Wash a glass slide with a 7:3 (v/v) ethanol/water solution and completely dry the glass using a wipe and an air stream.\nRemove the pieces of paper from a double-sided adhesive spacer to expose the double-sided adhesive spacer. Attach the spacer to a glass coverslip.\nPipette the nanocarrier/SDS solution onto the cover slip in the middle of the hole from the adhesive spacer.\nPlace the glass slide on top of the coverslip. Push on the glass slide to ensure that the glass slide and coverslip are well attached and form a seal.\nUse a confocal microscope for FCS measurements33. Use a 40X water immersion apochromat objective with a numerical aperture of 1.2. Use the appropriate excitation laser channel (488 nm) to collect at least 30 measurements of 10 s each per sample34. Ensure that the laser intensity and detector alignment remain the same for each sample.\nIn addition to the experimental samples, measure controls including: a blank sample without labelled siRNA; and a free siRNA sample with labelled siRNA but no mPEG-b-P(APNBMA).\nAnalyze the data using FCS-specific software. Identify the baseline count rate of each sample by determining the stable count rate during a time when no nanocarriers are passing through the confocal volume29.\nSubtract the count rate of the blank sample from every sample baseline count rate value. Normalize the resulting values to the free siRNA control to calculate the percent of free siRNA35.\n4. Kinetic Modeling to Predict Gene Silencing\nCreate scripts in a mathematical programming language using the simple set of ordinary differential equations to predict gene silencing29.\n\tNOTE: Scripts can be made available upon request.\n\t\nWrite the set of ordinary differential equations as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55803/55803eq1.jpg     (1)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55803/55803eq2.jpg     (2)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55803/55803eq3.jpg     (3)",
    "NOTE: For equations 1−3, the terms kmRNA, ksiRNA, and kprot are the rate constants for the production of mRNA, siRNA, and protein, respectively. The terms km,deg, ks,deg, and kp,deg are the rate constants for the degradation of mRNA, siRNA, and protein, respectively. Degradation rate constants are computed on the basis of the component half-lives, and production rate constants are fit to ensure that mRNA and protein steady-state values are reached in the absence of siRNA.\n\t\t\nDetermine the half-lives of the mRNA and protein for the gene(s) of interest, either experimentally as described in reference 36 or from the literature (see the Discussion). Also, determine the doubling time for the cell line. Input these values into the appropriate degradation rate expressions.\nTune the production rate constants so that gene expression levels remain steady at a normalized value of 100 if no siRNA is introduced. Specifically, set [siRNA] to zero and vary the values of the kmRNA, ksiRNA, and kprot production rate constants until [mRNA] and [protein] remain within 1% of the initial normalized value of 100% for the duration of the simulation.\nUsing the relative amounts of siRNA released from the previously described gel electrophoresis and FCS assays as estimates, adjust the initial relative concentration of siRNA in the script. Specifically, vary [siRNA] to be proportional to the relative amount of released siRNA, with a value of 100 corresponding to the maximum amount29.\n5. Cell Culture and  In Vitro siRNA Delivery\nCulture NIH/3T3 murine embryonic fibroblasts according to the protocols from the supplier.\nGrow the cells in growth medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin). Maintain the cells at 37 °C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2.\nSeed the cells in 6-well tissue culture treated plates.",
    "Follow the recommended subculturing procedure from the supplier. Count the cells using a hemocytometer. Dilute the cells in supplemented growth media to a concentration of 75,000 cells/mL.\nAdd 2 mL of cell suspension (75,000 cells/mL) to each well of the 6-well plate. Let the cells adhere and recover for 24 h in the incubator.\nPrepare the cells for transfection by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and adding 1.5 mL of serum- and antibiotic-free transfection medium (see the Table of Materials) to each well.\nFormulate the siRNA nanocarriers according to steps 1.1-1.2. Add 25 µL of nanocarrier solution containing 30 pmol of siRNA to each well. Gently pipette the media up and down to mix. Place the cells in the incubator for 3 h.\nRemove the transfection media and wash each well with PBS. Add 1 mL of supplemented growth media and place the cells in the incubator to recover for 30 min.\nTo prepare the cells for treatment with a photo-stimulus, remove the supplemented growth media. Add 1 mL of transfection media (without phenol red) to each well.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the transfection media does not contain phenol red.\nCalibrate and set a UV laser with a 365 nm filter to an intensity of 200 W/m. Ensure that the light intensity is measured from the location at which the bottom of the cell plate will be seated.\nPlace the cells on a hot plate set to 37 °C. Remove the plate cover of the cells. Irradiate the cells from above the plate for the desired time (up to 20 min) using the UV laser with a 365 nm filter at an intensity of 200 W m-2.",
    "Remove the transfection media and add 2 mL of supplemented growth media. Place in incubator until further analysis (e.g., 24 h for qPCR and 48 h for Western blotting).\nMeasure changes in gene expression using a variety of techniques such as Western blotting37 and qPCR.38 For genes with visible signals, such as GFP, use fluorescence microscopy29.\n\t\tNOTE: These techniques are suggested due to their ease of use and accuracy in quantifying gene expression\n6. Controlling Gene Silencing in a Spatiotemporal Manner\nCulture, seed, and transfect cells according to steps 5.1-5.7.\nPrepare a photomask that completely blocks 365 nm light and minimizes reflections.\n\tNOTE: In this case, 10 x 10 cm pieces of aluminum foil and black construction paper were used to block the light and to reduce reflections, respectively. The aluminum foil and construction paper were glued together to form a single unit.\n\t\nCut/punch/machine the desired shape into the photomask. For example, use a sharp-edged blade and a hole-puncher to form a straight-line pattern (~5 cm long) and a circular pattern (~7 mm diameter) in the photomask, respectively.\nGlue the photomask to the bottom of the 6-well plate with the pattern centered under the well containing the cells with the anti-reflective side (e.g., black construction paper) facing the plate. Ensure that the glue is not placed near the edge (within ~3 mm) of the pattern.\nSet up two ring stands approximately 25 cm apart and attach a platform to each ring stand so that the platforms are of equal height. Suspend the cell plate between the two stands by resting the plate on top of the platforms. Ensure that the plate is level.",
    "Irradiate the cells from below the sample for the desired time (up to 20 min) using the UV laser with a 365 nm filter at an intensity of 200 W/m2.\nRemove the transfection media and add 2 mL of supplemented growth media. Place in incubator to recover for at least 24 h. Image the cells using fluorescence microscopy as described29.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
