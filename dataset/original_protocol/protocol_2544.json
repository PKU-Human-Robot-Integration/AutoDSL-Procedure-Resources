    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart I: Preparation of porcine urinary bladders for organ culture\nTiming: Alternative 1 – total timing: 2–3 days, hands-on-time: 2–3 h\nTiming: Alternative 2 – total timing: 3–6 days, hands-on-time: 2–3 h\nTiming: 30 min (for step 1)\nTiming: 10 min (for steps 2a–j)\nTiming: 15 min to 3 h (variable) (for steps 2k–m)\nTiming: 5 min (for step 3a)\nTiming: overnight (16–20 h) (for step 3b)\nTiming: 10 min (for steps 3c–h)\nTiming: 40 min per bladder (for steps 4a–d)\nTiming: 24 h–48 h (for step 4e)\nTiming: 30 min (for steps 4f–h)\nTiming: 15 min (for steps 5a–b)\nTiming: 24 h–48 h (for steps 5c–d)\nTiming: 45 min (for steps 5e–j)\nTiming: 24 h–72 h (for steps 5k–l)\nIn a first step, PUBs were washed and de-epithelialized to enable the subsequent culture of engrafted pancreatic cells. De-epithelialization was achieved by enzymatic and mechanical treatment of the PUBs. PUBs were then either sterilized for long-term storage in PBS at 4°C or were immediately used.\nCritical: The use of sterile (autoclaved) forceps, scissors, and beakers at any time is mandatory to avoid handling-associated microbial contamination.\nObtaining porcine urinary bladders.\nCollect fresh porcine urinary bladders from the local slaughter-house within 3 h after isolation. Transportation on wet ice is recommended, however not obligatory.\nEnsure that PUBs are not frozen before processing.\nNote: PUBs should be processed as soon as possible after isolation to reduce microbial growth.\nCritical: Frozen PUBs should be discarded as scaffold integrity cannot be guaranteed.\nCleaning of PUBs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nTransfer PUB inside the laminar flow benches. Ensure the handling of PUBs under strict sterile conditions.\nUsing sterile forceps, transfer PUBs from the transportation bag to a 15-cm cell culture dish, filled with DPBS.",
    "Adjust orientation of the PUB so that the urethra faces the operator (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nRemove any adjacent tissue including fat, urethra, penis, vagina, or ureter (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nTransfer the PUB into a new 15-cm dish, filled with DPBS (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nAfter removal of the urethra, grab the bladder neck with forceps and use scissors to open it along the middle line (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUnfold the bladder and discard any remaining urine by washing the PUB in DPBS (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E).\nPerform a detailed visual inspection and check for bleedings, signs of infection, tumors, or other abnormalities (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E–1G).\nNote: Small bleedings (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G) can be trimmed away. In case of other abnormalities, discard the bladder. When signs of pus or infection are evident within the bladder, immediately discard the PUB, remove any contaminated tools, and rigorously clean the laminar flow bench before processing fresh bladders.\nTurn the bladder upside down and inspect the outer wall of the PUB for the same criteria as the inner side (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H–1J).\nNote: An example of a gross bleeding is presented in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J. Such PUB should be discarded.\nRemove the ureteral ostium (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H and 1I).\nTransfer the PUB into a beaker with excessive volume of bladder wash solution to ensure a complete submerging of the PUBs in the solution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K).\nIncubate for at least 5 min at room temperature and transfer to a new beaker with bladder wash solution.\nRepeat this step three times.\nNote: It is crucially important to completely cover the PUBs with wash solution. Extending the washing steps to up to 60 min/step was tested and may result in fewer microbial contaminations.\nDe-epithelialization of PUBs (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]),\nTransfer PUBs to a beaker filled with the dispase-II working solution.",
    "Note: It is important to ensure permanent contact of dispase-II working solution with the urothelial layer of the PUBs. The urothelial layer is located on the inner, highly folded side of the PUB. We typically use around 10 mL dispase-II working solution per bladder.\nIncubate the PUBs overnight at 4°C.\nTransfer one PUB at a time to a new 15-cm cell culture dish filled with DPBS.\nLift the PUB with forceps above the cell culture dish.\nStrip off the epithelial cell layer which was loosened by dispase-II treatment by using a second pair of forceps.\nRepeat this step from different angles of the bladder until complete removal of the epithelial layer.\nNote: Make sure to keep the PUB sterile while stripping off the urothelial layer. Take long sterile forceps (>15 cm) to avoid any direct contact between the PUB and the operator’s fingers.\nCritical: Sterility is crucial to ensure smooth experimental procedure.\nTransfer de-epithelialized PUBs to a beaker filled with DPBS and sway PUBs to remove any remaining urothelial cells.\nRepeat step g in a new beaker with fresh DPBS. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nAlternative 1: Taking PUBs directly into culture.\nNote: After cleaning and de-epithelization, PUBs can be taken directly into culture. Especially if interactions with the host, e.g., paracrine signaling, cell-cell communication with porcine cells etc., are of interest, the cultivation of non-sterilized PUBs may be beneficial. Good results for pancreatic cell culture on the PUB have been achieved by this method (please refer to Melzer et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). However, PUBs are degrading without additional PAA sterilization thereby limiting the culture period to a maximum of four weeks. Also, dropouts due to microbial contamination can be prevented by additional sterilization.\nNote: Always use sterile instruments to handle the PUBs.",
    "Transfer one PUB at a time into a new 15-cm cell culture dish filled with PBS.\nCut the PUB into pieces of approximately 2 cm2 with sterile scissors.\nAdd 6 mL of HBSS to each well of a 6-well plate.\nNote: To investigate potential contaminations, no antibiotics or antimycotics are added to the medium during this step. However, during cultivation of cells, media are supplemented with 3% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.\nNote: To reduce media to 3 mL per well of a 6-well plate, wells can be precoated with 3 mL of a 2% Agarose/PBS solution (sterilized by autoclavation). After solidification of the Agarose, medium can be filled up to 6 mL and cell strainers can be placed on top as described below. Agarose-filled plates can be also prepared in advance and stored for around two weeks at 4°C.\nPlace one 40-μm cell strainer into one well of the 6-well plate. Ensure that the cell strainer is being laid up the rim of the well and the mesh on the bottom is in contact with the medium.\nNote: Only the lower part of the cell strainer should be in contact with the medium. The strainer must not be placed completely into the medium and formation of air bubbles below the cell strainer should be avoided. Depending on the manufacturer of the plates and cell strainers, the volume of HBSS per well might need to be adjusted to fulfill these requirements. Be aware that not all manufacturers provide cell strainers that are suitable for this kind of application.",
    "Place a piece of PUB into each cell strainer of the 6-well plates. Ensure that the former urothelial side (tunica mucosa) is directed toward the air-phase (up) and the outer wall (tunica serosa) faces the medium (down). Incubate in a cell culture incubator for 24 h at 37°C with a 5% CO2 and 21% O2 atmosphere.\nNote: This period can be extended to 48 h, which might ease the detection of microbial contamination. However, non-sterilized bladders will lose viability and start to degrade. Therefore, longer pre-incubation times are not recommended for the direct culture method.\nCheck for any signs of microbial contamination by visual and microscopical inspection of the wells. Proceed with the next steps in case of no sign of contamination.\nNote: Contamination-free setting is critical for further experiments. Macroscopic signs of infections include cloudy medium and significant color changes of the medium. However, microbial contamination may be more discrete and should be also carefully investigated with a microscope. An example of contaminated and non-contaminated PUBs is presented in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nPrepare new 6-well plates containing 6 mL of the respective cell culture medium, including 3% antibiotic-antimycotic solution and in case of PSC-derived cultures 10 μM Y-27632.\nNote: A variety of different media, cytokines, and other substances were used in previous PUB experiments. While none of the conditions had an obvious impact on the PUB itself (concerning morphology of the scaffold), pre-testing of specific media formulations should be considered for new conditions and cell types.\nNote: To enhance cell viability of pluripotent stem cell-derived pancreatic cell types, add 10 μM Y-27632 for cell seeding.",
    "Transfer non-contaminated PUBs with their respective cell strainers into new 6-well plates by using sterile forceps, always ensuring that no air bubbles are present below the nylon meshes and PUBs are not covered by medium but only in contact on the lower site. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nAlternative 2: Sterilization of PUBs.\nNote: Follow these steps directly after step 3 as an alternative to step 4. Sterilization of PUBs is achieved by treatment with peroxy-acetic acid as initially described in Rosario et al.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nPrepare a beaker with around 350 mL sterilization solution.\nNote: Ensure coverage of all PUBs with sterilization solution. Typically, we use 350 mL sterilization solution for a maximum of 5 bladders.\nCritical: Sterilization with PAA reduces the likelihood of PUB-derived contamination. However, extreme precaution must be maintained when handling the PUBs to prevent operator-derived contamination.\nTransfer PUBs from DPBS to the sterilization solution with sterile forceps.\nIncubate the PUBs in sterilization solution for 24 h at 4°C–8°C.\nRepeat the sterilization for another 24 h with new sterilization solution.\nWash PUBs twice with DPBS for at least 5 min.\nNote: After washing, PUBs can be stored in DPBS at 4°C–8°C for up to 3 months. Longer storage periods were not tested.\nPause point: At this point, PUBs can be stored at 4°C–8°C in DPBS before continuing the procedure.\nTroubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nTransfer one PUB at a time to a 15-cm cell culture dish filled with DPBS.\nCut the PUB into pieces of approximately 2 cm2 with sterile scissors.\nPrepare 6-well plates containing 6 mL of the respective cell culture medium, including 3% antibiotic-antimycotic solution and in case of PSC-derived cultures also 10 μM Y-27632.\nNote: See part I-4c for the use of 3 mL 2% Agarose/PBS-coated plates to reduce culture media.",
    "Place a cell strainer into each well as indicated in step 4.\nTransfer PUB pieces into cell strainers, ensuring that the former urothelial side is facing the air and the tunica serosa is in contact with the medium.\nIncubate in a cell culture incubator for 24–72 h at 37°C.\nNote: The medium may rapidly turn yellow due to sudden pH change which is caused by the ongoing PAA-evaporation in case of little residual PAA. The yellow medium color switch alone should not be considered as a sign of contamination as long as no other signs are present. Carefully assess bacterial contamination under the microscope and continue with uncontaminated bladders.\nNote: No decline of quality was observed between 24–72 h, but 72 h is recommended in order to allow exclusion of contaminated bladders. Longer periods were not tested but are likely possible. However, when working with temperature-sensitive media or supplements such as cytokines that are degraded over time, a media change may be necessary before proceeding with the cell seeding to avoid loss of cell viability or differentiation status.\nCheck for any signs of contamination before proceeding with the cell seeding.\nNote: Although sterilization has been performed, microbial contamination cannot be totally excluded. Handling of the PUBs is challenging and comprises many steps prone to contamination. However, according to our experience, the rate of microbial contaminations drops to less than 5% of the PUBs if handled properly. Examples of contaminated PUBs are depicted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].",
    "Critical: Take quality control samples for histological examination of the de-epithelialization. Samples should include a native PUB control and a de-epithelialized PUB control after dispase-II treatment and also after PAA-treatment. Antibodies specific for the markers of your cells of interest should be used to discriminate them from porcine cells in case the de-epithelialization is not complete.\nAlways use sterilized tools and work under a sterile laminar flow hood to handle PUBs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2177-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Step 3: De-epithelialization of the porcine urinary bladder\nTwo pairs of forceps are used to remove the urothelial cell layer after enzymatic overnight digestion. One pair of forceps is used to hold the urinary bladder, the other is used to strip off the epithelial cell layer.\nPart II: Cell seeding and on-PUB culture\nTiming: Total timing: 4–5 h, hands-on-time: 2–3 h, for ongoing culture: 15 min\nTiming: 30 s per PUB (for steps 6a–b)\nTiming: 2 h-variable (for step 6c)\nTiming: variable (for step 7a)\nTiming: 45 min (for steps 7b–i)\nTiming: 15 min (for step 8)\nTiming: 15 min (for step 9)\nPrior to cell seeding, small rings will be placed on the PUBs serving as a boundary during seeding and subsequent culture. The herein described workflow worked robustly for different cell lines and cell numbers and across single cells, whole and fragmented organoids as indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. However, the optimal number of cells should be adjusted according to particular applications.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2177_9.csv\nPreparing bladders for seeding of cells.\nPlace two rings on each bladder using sterile forceps.\nNote: Rings should be placed straightly on PUBs to prevent cell suspension spilling during seeding.\nNote: We typically use two rings on each bladder, however, depending on applications and available cell numbers one might prefer the use of a single ring per bladder.\nGently press the ring into the scaffold to ensure close contact of the ring with the PUB.\nWait for at least 2 h before seeding cells.",
    "Note: Incubation period is flexible and can be extended to several days if PUBs are prepared in advance. However, a minimum amount of time (2 h) is critical to ensure proper settling and connection to the bladder.\nSeeding of cells.\nHarvest the cells/organoids following standard protocols for each specific cell/organoid type. A detailed description for pancreatic progenitor cells and organoids is provided in Breunig et al.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nNote: We typically harvest organoids by digestion of the Matrigel with 1 mg/mL collagenase/dispase for 2–4 h at 37°C in a cell culture incubator with 5% CO2 (typically 500 μL per well of a 24-well plate). Using this kind of enzymatic digestion, we have observed a proper digestion of the Matrigel without a significant decline in cell viability after harvesting. We stop the reaction with neutralization solution (twice the amount of the collagenase/dispase) and centrifuge the organoids for 5 min at 200 g before proceeding with the next steps. If singularization of cells is necessary, we wash the organoids once in DPBS and resuspend them in accutase, before incubating them 30 min at 37°C in a waterbath. After 15 min and at the end of the incubation, we gently pipette the organoids up and down to enhance the enzymatic digestion. The reaction is stopped by adding twice the amount of neutralization solution and centrifugation for 5 min at 200 g before proceeding with the next step.\nCount cell/organoid number. Cell/organoid numbers of different pancreatic cell types and co-cultures that worked well in our hands as well as their tested cultivation periods are provided in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Adjust cell/organoid numbers according to the number of intended rings.",
    "Note: Cultivation periods can be adjusted for specific purposes, e.g., time course of tumor development, invasion, maturation of pluripotent stem cell-derived pancreatic progenitors etc. So far, we did not culture cells longer than 4 weeks on non-sterilized bladders and did not culture cells longer than 8 weeks on sterilized bladders. While degradation of non-sterilized bladders limits the maximal cultivation time to around 4 weeks, sterilized bladders are likely stable far beyond 8 weeks.\nNote: Although low cell/organoid numbers were tested and led to a successful engraftment, the histological search for a small engraftment can be cumbersome. Hence, we advise adhering to recommended cell numbers giving rise to large and easily identifiable engraftments.\nIf co-cultures are intended, mix different cell types well by pipetting.\nNote: The exact number and ratio of cells for co-culture experiments should be optimized for the specific application but the recommended numbers in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] can serve as a starting point. Coculture approaches have proven to be a very useful tool to study, e.g., cell crosstalk between epithelial and stromal cells and to investigate stromal redrafting by tumor cells. Cell numbers should be adjusted to recommended cell numbers as initial starting point (recommended starting point 2,000 organoids per ring, 166,000 single cancer cells per ring, and respective amounts of stromal cells). However, testing of cellular composition is necessary to find the optimal ratio and number of each cell type for specific co-culture approaches of interest.\nCentrifuge cell suspensions and remove the supernatant completely.\nResuspend cells/organoids in the respective cell culture medium with a volume of 15 μL medium per ring. In case of PSC-derived cell cultures, add 10 μM Y-27632 to the medium.",
    "Note: The seeding volume was optimized for our system including organoids with a maximum organoid size of around 150 μm. Bigger/smaller organoids may need adjustments for the organoid numbers or seeding volume. However, we do not recommend to significantly increase the seeding volume as organoids will be mostly located then in the fragile Matrigel/medium layer rather than in contact with the PUB.\nNote: Using the same media formulation in ex vivo PUB experiments as in the in vitro culture of the cell type of interest, is a good starting point and led to robust and good results in our experiments. However, we observed that on-PUB propagation allowed removal of certain supplements such as FBS, cytokines, e.g., EGF, FGF-10 etc. Examples are given in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. However, head-to-head comparisons should be performed for the specific application before depleting any supplements from the original in vitro cell culture medium.\nFor every ring, add 15 μL GFR-Matrigel to the cell suspension to reach a final concentration of 50% GFR-Matrigel.\nAdd 30 μL of cell suspension to each ring.\nCarefully check for any potential spilling outside the rings and mark respective rings on the cell culture plates.\nNote: The likelihood of successful engraftment is very low if cell suspension spills outside of the ring.\nNote: Seeding without Matrigel was tested successfully for murine cancer cells.\nPlace the cell culture plates in a cell culture incubator at 37°C until the next medium change. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nOngoing culture.\nOnce to twice a week, prepare new 6-well plates containing 6 mL of the respective culture medium for the cell types seeded on the PUBs.",
    "Note: Frequency of medium changes depends on the presence of heat-labile molecules, e.g., cytokines, in your medium. If heat-labile molecules are within the medium, more frequent media changes might be necessary for your application.\nNote: See Part I/4c for the use of 3 mL 2% Agarose/PBS-coated plates to reduce culture media.\nTransfer PUBs from the old plate to the new plate using sterile forceps.\nTreatment of PUBs with drugs or small molecules to investigate cytotoxicity and transgene expression.\nNote: PUB can be used to investigate the effect of distinct compounds on the cellular behavior. For example, doxycycline can be added to the culture medium to modulate transgene expression with Tet-on systems (reviewed in.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). In our case, treatment of PUBs with the same doxycycline concentrations (3 μg/mL) as used in the in vitro cell culture counterparts resulted in robust transgene (HA-tagged KRASG12D-IRES-mCherry) expression.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] In addition, the investigation of cytotoxic components and their effect on cancer cells or patient-derived organoids in this organ culture model is feasible. In our setting, we have tested the effects of olaparib (3.7 μM) and irinotecan (1.1 μM).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nWhile doxycycline, olaparib and irinotecan have been added to the medium below the PUB requiring a penetration of the drug through the PUB scaffold, a direct treatment of cells can be also achieved by drug addition to the boundary rings. Thus, the use of other drugs and the duration of their application must be tested in respect to the specific application of interest as not all drugs might properly penetrate through the PUB scaffold.\nAdd the respective drug or small molecule in the concentration of interest to the medium.\nPerform medium change as described in Part II-3a-b.\nAlternatively, add the drugs in the desired concentration in a small volume, e.g., 30 μL, to the rings.",
    "Note: Treatment can also be directly started by adding the respective drug to the medium during seeding of the cells.\nCritical: Always use sterile forceps for handling PUBs.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2177_10.csv\nPart III: Histological examination of PUBs and harvesting of samples for RNA/DNA/FACS analysis\nTiming: Histology - Total timing: 2 days, hands-on-time: 15 min to variable\nTiming: RNA/DNA/FACS – Total timing: 5–8 h\nTiming: 5 min (for steps 10a–c)\nTiming: overnight (for step 10d)\nTiming: 5 min (for steps 10e–g)\nTiming: 14 h/variable (for step 10h)\nTiming: 5 min (for steps 10i–j)\nTiming: variable (for step 10k)\nTiming: 10 min (for steps 11a–f)\nTiming: 60 min/variable (for steps 11g–i)\nTiming: 20 min (for steps 11j–o)\nTiming: 30–45 min (for steps 11p–q)\nTiming: 20 min (for steps 11r–u)\nTiming: variable (for step 11v)\nIn this step, the harvesting of ex vivo on-PUB cultures for histological analysis is described in detail. For histological analysis, the orientation of the sample and the discrimination between porcine cells and human/murine cells is critical.\nPUB processing to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE).\nFill the wells of a new 6-well plate with 3.7% formaldehyde.\nNote: Formaldehyde is toxic and hazardous. Follow the manufacturer`s indications on how to handle and store it. Wear personal protection equipment (gloves, clothing, eye, and face protection) and avoid exposure to it.\nTake PUB pieces out of the cell strainers and transfer each to one well filled with formaldehyde.\nDrown the PUBs very carefully in the formaldehyde solution and ensure complete coverage.",
    "Note: At this stage, rings should not be removed by force from the PUBs if they do not come off by themselves. Please ensure that no air bubbles are within the rings when covered by formaldehyde. Do not add the formaldehyde on top of the PUBs to avoid mechanical removal of cells. Be especially careful when working with samples from short-term experiments. The shorter the experiment, the more Matrigel will be present, and cells will be suspended in the Matrigel layer which is more sensitive to mechanical forces.\nFix the cells overnight at 4°C–8°C.\nTake the PUBs out of the formaldehyde and carefully remove the rings to avoid the detachment of adherent cells.\nRemove any tissue distant to the rings from the PUBs with scissors or a scalpel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2177-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation of fixed PUB samples for histological analysis\nTissue outside of the implantation site can be removed (indicated by rectangle). If PUBs are used to investigate invasion they should be divided in the middle of the ring (indicated by the dashed line). The image on the right presents an example of a PUB after cutting the middle of the implantation site for vertical sectioning. Scale bars indicate 1 cm.\nOptional: Cut the piece of PUB in the middle of the former ring area, in case vertical sectioning and investigation of invasion into the former sub-epithelial stroma or muscle layer of the PUB is desired (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: Be careful when cutting into the middle of the implantation site as the seeded cells, especially in short-term condition, might be otherwise removed from the scaffold.\nPerform a standard automated dehydration series.\nTo embed the PUBs into paraffin, place the bladder upper side down (180° inversion).",
    "Note: Embedding and sectioning the PUBs with this horizontal orientation will lead to a plethora of structures. Also, structural arrangement of the engraftment can be investigated with this approach. For examples see Melzer et al.,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. However, invasion should only be carefully investigated on sections obtained from samples with this orientation, no truthful vertical interaction of the cells with the scaffold is mirrored. Examples are depicted in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nOptional: To investigate the process of invasion, turn the two halves obtained from cutting the middle of the implantation site of one ring (in g) by 90° so that the sectioned side of the PUB faces the bottom during paraffin embedding.\nNote: This vertical orientation will enable investigation of the interaction between the engrafted cells and the PUB scaffold. This enables evaluation of invasion and migration toward the former subepithelial stroma and muscle layer of the scaffold. While this is an excellent technique to analyze the cells with strong connection to the PUB scaffold, cells that are still located in the former Matrigel layer may be lost during dehydration or handling procedures. Hence, the number of detectable cells may be less than after horizontal sectioning.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2177-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Examples of successful engraftment and sectioning orientation\n(A) Example of horizontal sectioning of a tumor cell engraftment after 21 days.

However, invasion in this orientation should be carefully considered.\n(B) Example of tumor cells invading the PUB as investigated by vertical sectioning. Arrows indicate tumor cell infiltration.\nPerform standard histological staining procedures and confirm identity of your cells by specific staining.",
    "Note: Especially when working with non-sterilized PUBs, it becomes difficult to distinguish in H&E staining between urothelial cells of the pig and the cells of interest in case of incomplete removal of epithelial cells. The use of human-specific antibodies such as anti-human nucleoli, anti-human cytokeratine 19, as well as human specific Ki-67 (see also key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table], and1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] supplemental information), however, enables a clear discrimination between human and porcine cells. No issues in distinguishing human or murine cells from other porcine cells after treating PUBs with PAA during the initial preparation arose during our investigations.\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCritical: Careful handling is necessary to avoid removal of cells by mechanical forces. “Invasive” cells may also be observed when investigating sections prepared parallel to the surface (horizontal orientation). However, such observation should be regarded carefully as numerous foldings of the inner bladder wall may lead to false positive results if not sectioned vertically.\nHarvesting cells for RNA-, DNA-, and flow cytometry -based assays (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nFill the wells of a 6-well plate with DPBS.\nTransfer PUB pieces from cell strainers to the 6-well plate.\nCarefully submerge the PUBs in the DPBS and shake the plate to enable proper washing.\nRemove the rings from the PUBs very carefully.\nNote: Especially in short-term conditions, cells may be located in the Matrigel/medium layer rather than being fully attached to the scaffold. This may lead to a certain degree of instability with the subsequent risk of losing cells of interest when removing the rings from the scaffold. In that case, try to capture those Matrigel-embedded cell clusters with a pipette and further process them along with the PUBs in subsequent steps.\nPrepare a new 12-well plate. Fill the wells with 2 mL of collagenase-II working solution.",
    "Note: Other enzymatic digestion approaches may also work. In short-term experiments with cultivation of cells for up to 5 days, we achieved comparable RNA yield with either accutase (30–45 min incubation) only and or collagenase/dispase (2 h incubation) digestion only. However, in long-term conditions (>2 weeks), we observed a much better detachment of cells when using the collagenase-II solution for isolation of cells from the PUB scaffold.\nNote: Also porcine cells of the scaffold PUB can be isolated by this method, which can become relevant for certain downstream applications.\nTake PUBs from the DPBS and place them with the cell containing side up into the collagenase-II working solution.\nNote: Ensure complete coverage of the PUBs with the collagenase-II sollution.\nIncubate for 60 min at 37°C on an orbital shaker with 115 rotations per minute.\nNote: Incubation on an orbital shaker outperformed the enzymatic digestion without a shaker.\nShake the plates carefully to allow cells to spread throughout the whole well.\nCheck under the microscope if cells are floating around. In case of very few detached cells, prolong the incubation in the collagenase-II solution to up to 180 min.\nNote: We did not observe a decline in cell viability, however, cell viability should be assessed for individual cell lines, e.g., in flow cytometry (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nUse forceps to lift the PUBs and hold it against the edges of the well. Aspirate the collagenase-II solution containing the cells with a pipette and rinse it against the former ring area of the PUBs to loosen any remaining cells.\nTransfer collagenase-II solution to a 15-mL centrifugation tube.\nUse 4 mL neutralization solution to wash the wells and after rinsing the bladders again, transfer the cell suspension to the same tube.\nPerform a centrifugation at 200–250 × g for 5 min.",
    "Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 2 mL DPBS.\nRepeat the centrifugation at 200–250 × g and aspirate the DPBS.\nNote: Cells are now ready for DNA- or RNA-isolation. We applied the GeneJet RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher, https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012664_GeneJET_RNA_Purification_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0012664_GeneJET_RNA_Purification_UG.pdf]) or the Animal Tissue Genomic DNA Purification Mini Prep Kit (Genaxxon, https://www.genaxxon.com/shop-all-products/rna-dna-protein-reinigung/dna-reinigungskits/554/tissue-genomic-dna-purification-mini-spin-column-kit-50-columns?number=[href=https://www.genaxxon.com/shop-all-products/rna-dna-protein-reinigung/dna-reinigungskits/554/tissue-genomic-dna-purification-mini-spin-column-kit-50-columns?number=]) according to manufacturer`s instructions, respectively. However, to perform flow cytometry, cells must be singularized as indicated in the following steps.\nNote: As the collagenase-II digestion leads to isolation of porcine cells as well, precautions have to be taken into consideration for further downstream analysis. There is a high chance of porcine DNA-contamination. RNA is likely degraded over time and during treatment with peroxy-acetic acid. However, even in sterilized samples, remnant porcine nucleic acid fragments including RNA were detected in scaffold-only samples. Hence, choosing human-specific (or murine-specific) primers is mandatory to avoid measuring porcine scaffold gene expression. Indeed, after reverse transcription and performing a qRT-PCR analysis, we hardly detected any mRNA gene expression in PAA-treated scaffold-only samples for several different primers. Examples of DNA-, RNA- concentration and gene expression of two housekeeping genes (HMBS, GAPDH) as well as four other genes (KRT19, CDH1, PDX1, COL4A1) are depicted in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nTroubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nResuspend cell pellet in 1 mL accutase.\nIncubate at 37°C in a waterbath for 30 min. Mix well by pipetting up and down after 15 min.\nNote: Incubation can be extended to 40 min if cell clusters are still present in microscopic examination.\nTake cells from the waterbath and pipette up and down again until cells are homogeneously resuspended using a 1,000 μL pipette and respective tips.\nAdd 2 mL of neutralization solution and mix well.\nPerform a centrifugation at 200–250 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend in 2 mL DPBS.",
    "Subject the cells from the PUBs to standard flow cytometry staining and measurement.\nNote: When subjecting cells to flow cytometry analysis, antibody specificity for human/murine cells should be tested. Representative flow cytometry results for cell viability and the expression of the pan-human marker HLA-ABC are demonstrated in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2177-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Workflow for isolation of cells from PUBs\nThe upper panel is a schematic representation of the workflow and timing necessary to isolate cells from the PUBs. The middle panel shows the transfer of PUBs from cell strainers to 12-well plates filled with DPBS. Tissue not adjacent to the rings is removed with scissors. After shaking PUBs in DPBS and careful removal of the rings, PUBs are transferred into new wells, filled with collagenase-II working solution. After a 1–3 h incubation on a shaker, the supernatant, containing the cells of interest, is collected in a centrifugation tube, PUBs are additionally rinsed with neutralization solution, and neutralization solution is added to the centrifugation tube. After centrifugation and washing in DPBS, cells are incubated in accutase for 30 min to achieve singularization of the cells. PUB-derived cells are then stained with specific antibodies to perform flow cytometry.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2177-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Representative flow cytometry results after isolation of cells from the PUB\nPUBs without prior cell seeding (scaffold) and PUBs with seeding of human pancreatic progenitor cells and cultivation for 6 weeks were treated with collagenase-II. Subsequent singularization was performed with accutase. Cells were stained for DAPI to exclude dead cells and with a human-specific HLA-ABC-APC antibody according to manufacturer`s recommendations. Presence of viable cells expressing HLA-ABC was only detected in samples with prior seeding of human cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2177-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.
