    "All procedures were approved by the University Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects.\n1. Preparation of the Participant’s Leg\nHave the participant neatly roll up their shorts for the desired leg. Then tape the shorts so that the quadriceps femoris muscle group is exposed and draw a line around the area the participant needs to shave.\nIMPORTANT: Have the participant shave their leg before the test rather than the previous day as this ensures that there are no stubbles which may interfere with the EMG signal.\nOnce the participant has finished shaving the desired area of the leg, clean the shaved area with rubbing alcohol to ensure there are no remnants of the shaving gel (or cream) which can interfere with the EMG signal.\n2. Measurement of Leg for Electrode Placement\nIn order to place the EMG electrode on the vastus lateralis muscle, make the following measurements\n\t\nHave the participant stand straight facing the researcher.\nLocate the anterior spina iliaca superior (ASIS) and the lateral side of the patella. The ASIS is the hip bone; palpate it by placing the hand on either side of the abdomen below the umbilicus.\nWith a tape measure, measure the distance between the two locations identified above and take 2/3 of that value on the line from the ASIS to the lateral side of the patella. Note: Further information regarding placement of EMG electrodes can be found on the SENIAM (Surface Electromyography for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles) URL: http://www.seniam.org/\n3. Placement of the EMG Electrodes",
    "After the location of the vastus lateralis has been identified, take the EMG electrodes (most researchers use commercially available disposable Ag-Ag Cl electrodes) and place over the vastus lateralis without removing the adhesive shield. Then with a pen mark the area where the gel portion of the electrode makes contact with the muscle. Ensure that the interelectrode distance is 20 mm center-to-center.\nUse a piece of sandpaper (60 coarse) to gently abrade these two areas to remove the superficial layer of the skin. During this time, ask the participant their level of discomfort. Stop abrading when the participant indicates the area is warm.\nClean the abraded areas with a towel that is dampened with rubbing alcohol or an alcohol swab. Allow the area on the leg to dry before placing the EMG electrodes.\nPlace the EMG electrodes on the sites that were abraded (Figure 2). Take care not to place the electrodes on the iliotibial band (IT band). Ask the participant to contract the quadriceps femoris muscles in order to palpate the vastus lateralis. Place the electrodes on the muscle to ensure it is not on the IT band. Note: If the electrodes on the IT band, the EMG signal would be dampened when the participant is asked to maximally contract.\nPlace the reference electrode (3rd electrode) on a boney attachment site such as the ASIS thus not interfering with movement of the lower limbs during the exercise bout.\n4. Checking the EMG Signal\nPrior to starting the exercise test, check the interelectrode impedance.\n\tNote: This step is critical because if the signal has too much noise then the EMG data collected during the exercise test will be invalid.\n\t\nHave the participant sit in a chair and connect the EMG leads to their respective electrodes attached to the participant’s leg.",
    "At this point, have the participant relax their leg, having no tension in the muscle. Then after about 30 sec of relaxation, have the participant maximally contract their quadriceps femoris muscles for 5 sec and then go back to being completely relaxed.\nWhen performing the task above (step 4.1.2), record the participants EMG signal on the computer.\nEnsure that the interelectrode impedance is <2,000 ohms. Moreover, if a voltmeter is available in the laboratory, then check the baseline noise and keep below 5 µV. In addition, set the sampling frequency at 1,000 Hz.\n5. Setting-up the Cycle Ergometer\nAfter checking the interelectrode impedance, have the participant move from the chair to the cycle ergometer.\nHave the participant stand next to the cycle ergometer and raise their knee until the thigh is parallel with the ground. Then have the participant hold this position and adjust the seat height to match the same height as the participant’s thigh.\nThereafter, have the participant sit on the cycle ergometer seat and then pedal a couple times while asking them if they are comfortable with the seat height. If needed, adjust the seat height.\nEnsure that the participant’s legs are near full extension with a slight bend (~5°) in the knees during each pedal revolution.\nBefore starting the test, have the participant wear a polar heart rate monitor so that heart rate can be documented throughout the exercise test.\n6. Performing the EMG Fatigue Threshold Protocol\nHave the participant start cycling and gradually increase their cadence to 70 revolutions/min. Then increase the power output on the cycle ergometer to 50 W.\nHave the participant cycle at this power output for approximately 2-3 min.\n\tNote: This is a low intensity exercise and will serve as the warm-up.",
    "After the warm-up period, increase the power output by 25 W every 2 min until the participant is no longer able to maintain the 70 revolutions/min cadence or requests that the test be stopped.\n\tNote: It should be noted that during the exercise test, the EMG signal is recorded for 10 sec epochs during each 2 min stage for sec 10–20, 30–40, 50–60, 70–80, 90–100, and 110-12021. Most EMG systems will have an option to set the automatic recording at the desired interval. Thus, for each stage there should be 6 data files.\nOnce the incremental test has concluded, have the participant perform a cool down at 50 W. Check that the length of the cool down corresponds with having the participant’s heart rate return to the value during the warm-up phase. Monitor this by checking the participant’s heart rate using the polar heart rate monitor.\nOnce the cool down is completed, remove the EMG leads and have the participant step off the cycle ergometer and return to the chair. Then carefully remove the EMG electrodes and wipe the areas with a clean towel dampened with rubbing alcohol or an alcohol swab.\n7. Processing the EMG Signal\nAfter the test is completed, process the raw EMG data files that were collected during the exercise test so that the data can be used to determine the EMG fatigue threshold.\n\t\nPerform processing of the EMG signal with either the software used to collect the EMG signal or custom written software using various platforms such as MATLAB or LabVIEW.",
    "Filter the collected EMG signals using a band-pass filter. Use a setting of 10 to 500 Hz. Note: This alters the frequency of the signal so that low frequency artifacts due to movement of the EMG leads (<10 Hz), and high frequency artifacts from the environment (>500 Hz), are removed. Use a notch filter of 60 Hz if there is any interference from the power supply of the computer or EMG system.\nOnce the signal has been filtered, determine the signal amplitude by calculating the root mean square value of the signal: Square each of the data points, sum them, divide by the number of data points, then take the square root of the resulting value. Perform these calculations using the aforementioned software.\n8. Determining the EMG Fatigue Threshold for Each Participant\nPerform the following steps for each participant.\n\t\nAfter the EMG signal has been processed; use a statistical program (e.g.: GraphPad Prism) and label the first column “Time” and the subsequent columns with the power outputs used for the test.\nFor each power output, fill-in the corresponding EMG amplitude value for each 20 sec interval.\nFor each power output, analyze the time (x-axis) vs EMG amplitude (y-axis) relationship with linear regression to determine if the slope of the regression line is significantly (p <0.05) different from zero.\nAfter performing the linear regression analyses for all power outputs, identify the highest power output with a non-significant (p >0.05) slope.\nThen identify the lowest power output with a significant (p <0.05) slope.\nOnce these two power outputs have been identified, add them and divide by 2; the resultant power output is the estimated EMG fatigue threshold.\nSubscription Required.
