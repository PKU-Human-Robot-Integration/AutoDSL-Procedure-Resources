Preparation of the scaffolds and the RCCS™ bioreactor\n(A) Preparation of scaffolds from a cube of gelatin sponge (Spongostan™).\n(B) Positioning of scaffolds in the 96-well suspension culture plate and HS-5 BMSC seeding.\n(C and D) The RCCS™ 4DQ bioreactor (Synthecon, Inc,): the bioreactor is composed by a working station (C) with 4 independent positions for vessels and a power supply (D) with a tachometer controlling the speed of rotation of each vessel. The rotation of vessels is counterclockwise and maintains the scaffolds in a free fall condition simulating microgravity. The dynamic culture allows optimal mass transfer, delivery of nutrients and of oxygen, avoiding cell sedimentation.\n(E) High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV): it is composed by one Plug Fill port, two syringe ports and a silicon membrane for gas exchange.\n(F) High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) with the Plug Fill port opened.\nUnder sterile conditions, in a laminar flow hood, open the blister containing the gelatin sponge (Spongostan™) and place it in a Petri dish. Gelatin sponge is supplied as a cube of 10 mmx10 mmx10 mm.\nUsing a scalpel cut the sponge into 3 slices of about 3 mm each.\nWith a 4 mm diameter punch, cut four equal cylinders per slice. It is possible to obtain 12 cylinders/scaffolds per sponge with dimensions 4 mm in diameter by 3 mm in height.",
    "Retrieval of HS-5 BMSC by trypsin treatment. Counting and dilution of cell suspension.\nDetach HS-5 BMSC cells from the culture flask by trypsin treatment and re-suspend them in CTM (DMEM+10% FBS), the volume depends on the flask (for T75 >5 mL for T25<5 mL).\nCount live HS-5 BMSCs by trypan blue exclusion method.\nRe-suspend the cells at the concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL.\nSeeding of gelatin scaffolds with HS-5 BMSCs and static incubation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPlace one gelatin scaffold per well in a 96-well, U-bottom, cell suspension plate.\nSeed 200000 HS-5 BMSCs per scaffold (corresponding to 20 μL of cell suspension) allowing the entire volume (20 μL) to be absorbed by the sponge to homogenously distribute HS-5 BMSCs within the scaffold.\nFor a better distribution of the cells inside the scaffolds, slowly pipette each scaffold 3 times with a p100 micropipette equipped with a tip whose extremity is cut off (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1888-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. How to pipette each scaffold with a cut tip\nIncubate the 96-well plate in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 and 37°C for 4 h.\nCritical: The gelatin scaffolds are very light and electrostatic and tend, if not well positioned, to exit the plate when located under the sterile hood. It is therefore advisable to position the scaffolds in any well of the plate with the help of forceps. To prevent evaporation of the medium in the wells containing the scaffolds, fill the empty wells surrounding the scaffolds with PBS.\nStep 2: Dynamic seeding in the RCCS™ bioreactor of gelatin scaffold with HS-5 BMSC\nTiming: 18 h",
    "This section describes how to complete efficiently the seeding of BMSCs in the scaffolds under dynamic conditions in the RCCS™ bioreactor (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D). This step avoids cell sedimentation, favoring the homogeneous distribution of the cells within the scaffold.\nThe RCCS™4DQ bioreactor is equipped with four independent vessel stations (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) and a tachometer for rotation control (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). The vessel rotation on a horizontal axis (clinorotation) maintains the scaffolds in a free-fall condition (mimicking microgravity), generating a constant dynamic fluid flow. This guarantees an optimal mass transfer, which results in optimal viability of the cells within the scaffolds (Ferrarini et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6], 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Moreover, the HARV vessels are equipped with a gas exchange membrane that favors the optimal oxygenation of the scaffolds.\nPreparation of HARV vessel, transfer of scaffolds from 96-well plate to HARV vessel and dynamic seeding in the RCCS™ bioreactor.\nTake a new 10 mL Disposable High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) and wash it by inserting 5 mL PBS through the open plug fill port (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nWith a 5 mL pipette, through the plug fill port, remove the PBS.\nWith a p200 micropipette remove any residual PBS.\nThrough the plug fill port, add 600 μL of pre-warmed medium (DMEM+10%FBS) to the vessel.\nUsing a p100 pipette with a cut tip, carefully aspirate the scaffolds from the wells and one by one transfer them, through the plug fill port, in the HARV vessels (up to 3 scaffolds/vessel).\nClose the plug fill port and place the vessels in the vessel station of the bioreactor, inside the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nDynamic seeding, in the RCCS™ bioreactor, of gelatin scaffolds with HS-5 BMSC.\nSet the tachometer to a rotation speed of 7.5 rpm and leave the scaffolds overnight inside the vessel.",
    "Step 3: Dynamic culture of CLL cells (MEC-1) or MM cells (MM.1S) inside HS-5 BMSCs populated scaffolds\nTiming: 48–72 h total\nTiming: 5 h 30 min for step 6\nTiming: 30 min preparation + 48 h/72 h culture for step 7\nThis section explains how to seed the scaffolds, previously populated with stromal cells, with tumor cells and how to keep them in culture in the RCCS™ bioreactor.\nRetrieval of tumor cells (MEC-1 or MM.1S) from the culture flasks and dynamic seeding in the scaffolds.\nRetrieve MEC-1 cells or MM.1S cells from culture flasks, centrifuge them at 410 × g for 5 min and re-suspend them in ≅5 mL fresh pre-warmed medium (RPMI+10%FBS).\nCount cells by trypan blue exclusion method.\nIf the vessel contains one or two scaffolds:\nRe-suspend MEC-1 cells in CTM (RPMI+10%FBS) to obtain a final concentration of 10 × 106 cells/mL.       OR\nRe-suspend MM1.S cells in CTM (RPMI+10%FBS) to obtain a final concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/mL.\nTo the HARV vessel add 2 × 106 MEC-1 (corresponding to 200 μL of cell suspension) or 500 × 103 MM.1S (corresponding to 200 μL of cell suspension) for each scaffold through the plug fill port to obtain inside the vessel a final volume of 800 μL for 1 scaffold or 1 mL for 2 scaffolds. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]-1).\nIf the vessel contains three scaffolds:\nRe-suspend MEC-1 cells in CTM (RPMI+10%FBS) to obtain a final concentration of 15 × 106 cells/mL.       OR\nRe-suspend MM1.S cells in CTM (RPMI+10%FBS) to obtain a final concentration of 3.75 × 106 cells/mL.",
    "To the HARV vessel add 6 × 106 MEC-1 (corresponding to 400 μL of cell suspension) or 1.5 × 106 MM.1S (corresponding to 400 μL of cell suspension) through the plug fill port to obtain inside the vessel a final volume of 1 mL (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]-1).\nSet rotation speed to 7.5 rpm and allow the cell seeding to proceed for 5 h in the incubator at 37°C and 5%CO2.\nDynamic culture of populated scaffolds.\nPre-warmed CTM (RPMI+10%FBS) is added to the vessels through the syringe ports using sterile 5 mL syringes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) using the following steps:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1888-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. How to fill vessels with medium step by step\nInsert a sterile 5 mL syringe in a syringe port with the plunger removed (syringe A in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nInsert another 5 mL sterile syringe (syringe B in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) to the second port.\nFill syringe A with 5 mL of CTM (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].4).\nWith syringe B, slowly draw the air out of the vessel and let the medium enter from the second syringe (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].5).\nRepeat steps ii-iii to fill the vessel with a total of ≅11 mL CTM.\nClose the syringe ports and discard the syringes.\nPut the vessel in the bioreactor in the incubator at 37°C and 5%CO2.\nStart the culture by setting the rotation speed initially to 7.5 rpm and then increasing it, up to 14 rpm, to prevent the sedimentation of the scaffolds and to maintain them in a free-fall condition.\nKeep the scaffolds in culture in the bioreactor for 48–72 h. If 3D culture continues, change the medium.\nNote: If air bubbles are formed, these can be removed with the two syringes placed in the syringe ports.",
    "Note: Speed rotation must be settled to maintain scaffolds in a free-fall condition: it means that the scaffolds must neither precipitate under the action of gravity, nor turn in the vessel under the action of the centrifugal force. These forces must be balanced by adjusting the rotational speed usually starting from 7.5 rpm and up to 14 rpm.\nNote: It is important to monitor the color of the medium: if the color of the medium turns yellow it is important to change it. Normally when active proliferating cell lines are cultured (as MEC-1 cells), medium must be changed more frequently (after 48 h) than primary slowly or not proliferating cells.\nMedium change.\nInsert a sterile 5 mL syringe in a syringe port and carefully aspirate 2 mL of medium. Discard it or put it in a 15 mL tube for future analysis.\nOpen the second syringe port (in order to let the air enter/removing the vacuum) and with the syringe aspirate the remaining medium paying attention to not remove any scaffolds.\nInsert a sterile 5 mL syringe (B) in a syringe port (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nInsert another 5 mL sterile syringe (A), removing the plunger, in the second syringe port and fill it with CTM as explained in Step 3.7a (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPut the vessel in the bioreactor in the incubator and continue the culture.\nNote: It is possible to discard the medium or to store it at −20°C for further analysis.\nOptional: You may recover cells in the SN medium by centrifuging it at 410 × g.\nCritical: Change the medium slowly and carefully to avoid removal of the scaffolds or generation of turbulence inside the vessel.\nStep 4: Recovering of the scaffolds from the RCCS™ bioreactor and subsequent analysis\nTiming: 1 h",
    "This section explains how to recover scaffolds, SN and cells in SN from the vessel, and how to process them for subsequent analysis.\nRecovering of scaffolds, SN and cells in SN from the vessels.\nWith a syringe, gently aspirate 2 mL of SN from the vessel through a syringe port and put it in a 15 mL tube.\nOpen the plug fill port and pour the content of the vessel into a Petri dish or a 6-well plate scaffolds and SN.\nEnzymatic digestion of scaffolds and retrieval of cells for counting and flow cytometry.\nAdd 500 μL of Liberase™ 25 μg/mL in a FACS tube and place one scaffold. Alternatively, add 1 mL of Liberase™ for the digestion of 2 or 3 scaffolds.\nLet the tube/tubes incubate for 10 min at 37°C for the complete digestion of the scaffolds.\nVortex tube to facilitate cell disaggregation and to re-suspend cells. (Alternatively pipette digested scaffold).\nBlock the enzymatic digestion adding 500 μL (or 1 mL FBS if using 1 mL of Liberase™) of FBS.\nCount cells by trypan blue exclusion.\nCentrifuge tube/tubes at 410 × g for 5 min, wash cells with 1 mL of PBS.\nCentrifuge again as in f and discard SN.\nUse cells for successive staining and flow cytometry.\nNote: The ratio of Liberase™ to FBS is 1:1.\nIf apoptosis detection must be performed wash cells with the Binding Buffer (included in the apoptosis detection kit).\nFixation of scaffolds for confocal analysis.\nAdd 300 μL of PFA 4% per well of a 48-well plate.\nInsert 1 scaffold per well in order to fix it and let it fix ON at room temperature (RT).\nWash scaffolds with Blocking Solution for subsequent staining and confocal analysis.\nLysis of scaffolds for Western blot analysis.\nPlace one scaffold in a 1.5 mL vial.",

    "After 72 h of dynamic culture in the bioreactor, retrieve 1–2 mL of medium from the vessels with a syringe and aliquot into a 15 mL tube. During this operation let the scaffolds settle on the opposite site of the vessels in order to minimize their perturbation.\nRemove the syringe, open the Plug Fill port and gently remove the remaining medium containing cells that did not enter the scaffolds.\nPlace the removed cells/media in the 15 mL tube from step b.\nCount cells in SNs to verify that the number of cells entered in the scaffolds are homogeneously distributed between the 2 vessels (Unt and Ibr).\nClarify SNs by centrifuging tubes for 5 min at 1500 rpm RT.\nDiscard the cells that did not enter the scaffolds and retrieve medium.\nThrough the syringe ports, as explained previously, (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) gently re-add recovered SNs inside the vessels with or without the addition of Ibr 1 μM and avoid the generation of turbulence.\nCritical: When removing medium from the vessels be careful not to remove any of the scaffolds.\nBortezomib (Btz) treatment to evaluate its action in inducing MM cells death.\nPrepare one vessel for Unt condition and one vessel for Btz treatment both containing up to 3 scaffolds.\nThrough one syringe port with a 1 mL syringe, add Btz diluted in a little amount of medium (≅300 μL) in order to obtain a concentration of 10 nM inside the vessel.\nStep 7: Assessment of the impact of drugs on tumor cells\nTiming: 2 h for step 20\nTiming: 1 h 30 min for step 21\nThis section shows how to evaluate the impact of Ibr on CLL cells and of Btz on MM cells.\nAssessment of the impact of Ibr on CLL cells (Barbaglio et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).",
