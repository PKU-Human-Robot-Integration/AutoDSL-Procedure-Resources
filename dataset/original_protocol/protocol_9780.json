    "All animal procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Choosing a carbon fiber array\nChoose a printed circuit board (PCB) from one of the three designs shown in Figure 1.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, Flex Arrays will be the focus.\n\t\nRefer to PCB designs on the Chestek Lab website (https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu), free of charge and ready to be sent to and ordered for printing through a PCB printing house.\nSee Table 1 for a summary of connectors for each board and their specifications to help choose the connector that will work for the specific experimental setup.\n2. Soldering the connector to the circuit board\nSet a soldering iron to 315 °C (600 °F).\nApply flux to all soldering pads on the PCB.\n\tNOTE: Flux within a tube can be squeezed across the pads, while flux in a pot can be applied with the wooden end of a cotton-tipped applicator by smearing the flux across all pads liberally.\nForm small mounds of solder on the back pads of the Flex Array (Figure 2A).\nSolder the bottom row of connector pins to the back row of solder pads (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: All board designs provided by the Chestek lab were designed so that the connectors would pair precisely with their designated board.\n\t\nTo do this, solder the pins on either side of the connector with easy access to the solder mounds. Once secure, gently push the soldering iron tip between the front pins to solder the remaining connections in the back.\n\t\tNOTE: Once the back row of pins is secure, the rest of the connector will align with each pin above its assigned solder pad.",
    "Solder the front row of pins to the board by applying a small amount of solder to each pin. Apply an additional layer of flux if soldering is not happening quickly.\n\t\nClean excess flux away with 100% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and a short bristle brush.\nEncapsulate the soldered connections in delayed set epoxy (Figure 2 C,D) using a 23 G needle and 1 mL syringe placed bevel side down on the pins. Push epoxy through the syringe slowly so that it flows into and along the connections.\n\t\nLeave the board overnight so that the delayed set epoxy can cure.\n\t\tNOTE: While the product insert for the delayed set epoxy states that it cures in 30 min, leaving it overnight allows a more stable connection to form.\nSecure the backside of the board to the sides of the connector by laying a small line of delayed set epoxy across the back side of the board and pulling that onto the edges of the connector.\n\t\nLeave the board to cure overnight again.\n\t\t​NOTE: At this point, either store the arrays or continue the build. If pausing in the build, store the arrays in a clean, dry box at room temperature.\n3. Fiber population\nCut a pulled glass capillary so that its tip fits between the traces of the array (Figure 3A).\n\t\nUsing a glass puller and filament, make capillaries using the following settings: Heat = 900, Pull = 70, Velocity = 35, Time = 200, Pressure = 900.\n\t\tNOTE: Numbers are unitless and specific to this device (see the Table of Materials).",
    "Use the wooden ends of two cotton-tipped applicators (one per each part of silver epoxy) to scoop a small, ~1:1 ratio of silver epoxy in a plastic dish and mix using the same sticks used to scoop. Discard the applicators after mixing.\nCut 2-4 mm off the end of the carbon fiber bundle onto a piece of printer paper using a razor blade. To easily separate the fibers in the bundle, which are difficult to tease apart, pull a laminated piece of paper gently over the top of the bundle.\n\tNOTE: The laminated piece of paper transfers static into the fibers, which will separate by themselves.\nApply silver epoxy between every other pair of traces on one side of the board with the glass capillary (Figure 3B).\n\t\nTake a small drop of epoxy onto the end of a pulled capillary. Gently apply between every other trace on the end of the board, filling the gap.\n\t\tNOTE: The gap should be filled to the top of the two traces without overflowing to touch neighboring traces. Each trace is connected to one channel. This method of epoxy population means that each fiber will have two channels connected to it. This is because two traces allow for better fiber alignment, and redundancy in channel helps ensure electrical connection.\nUse Teflon-coated tweezers to place one carbon fiber in each epoxy trace (Figure 3C).\nUse a clean pulled capillary to adjust the carbon fibers, so they are perpendicular to the end of the Flex Array board and buried beneath the epoxy (Figure 3D).\nPlace the arrays on a wooden block with fibered ends overhanging the edge of the block.\n\tNOTE: The weight of the back end will keep the array on the block.",
    "Bake the wooden block and arrays at 140 °C for 20 min to cure the silver epoxy and lock the fibers into place.\nRepeat steps 3.4-3.8 for the other side of the board.\n\tNOTE: Arrays can be stored after any baking step; however, static from the storage boxes may cause the fibers to pull away from the board if too little silver epoxy was applied when populating the board.\n\t\nCreate a raised adhesive platform within a box so that the bulk of the board can be stuck to the adhesive allowing the fibered ends of the board to be suspended within the box to prevent fiber breakage. Store at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: If fibers pull away from the board during storage, scrape the epoxy out of the traces with a clean pulled glass capillary and repeat steps 3.1-3.8 to replace the fibers. From this point on, arrays must be stored with the fibers suspended in this manner to prevent fiber breakage.\n4. Applying ultra-violet (UV) epoxy to insulate the carbon fibers\nUse a clean capillary and apply a small droplet (~0.5 mm in diameter of UV epoxy on the exposed traces on one side of the board (Figure 4A). Continue to add UV epoxy droplets until the traces are completely covered.\n\tNOTE: Do not allow the UV epoxy to get on the carbon fibers past the end of the PCB to ensure a smooth insertion later.\nCure the UV epoxy under a UV pen light for 2 min (Figure 4B).\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.2 for the other side of the board.\nCut the fibers to 1 mm using a stereoscope reticle and surgical scissors.",
    "NOTE: Arrays can be stored at this point until ready to proceed to the next steps. They should be stored in a box that will elevate the carbon fibers away from the box itself. Arrays can be stored at room temperature indefinitely.\n5. Checking electrical connections with 1 kHz impedance scans (Figure 5)\nSubmerge carbon fibers 1 mm into 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nTo complete the circuit, use a silver-silver chloride (Ag|AgCl) reference electrode and a stainless steel rod (counter electrode).\n\t\nUsing a beaker clamp, suspend the Ag|AgCl electrode in the 1x PBS and connect it to the reference of the impedance system being used.\nUsing a beaker clamp, suspend the stainless steel rod in the 1x PBS and connect to the counter electrode input of the impedance system being used.\nRun a 1 kHz impedance scan for each fiber using a potentiostat set to a 1 kHz scan frequency at 0.01 Vrms in a single sine waveform. Set the potentiostat to 0 V at the beginning of each scan for 5 s to stabilize the recorded signal. Record the measurements via the potentiostat-associated software.\n\tNOTE: Measurements can be taken at any point in the build; however, they are only necessary before insulation and during tip preparation. Table 2 lists typical ranges of impedances after each build step at 1 kHz for the user's reference.\nRinse the fibers in deionized (DI) water by dipping them into a small beaker three times and leave them to dry at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Arrays can be left in storage until the user can continue onto the next step.\n6. Parylene C Insulation\nNOTE: Parylene C was chosen as the insulation material for the carbon fibers as it can be deposited at room temperature over batches of arrays and provides a highly conformal coating.",
    "Mask the Flex Array connector using the mating connector.\nPlace a batch of 8-12 arrays into a storage box with a raised adhesive platform so that they can be insulated in one run. Place the arrays so that the connector end of the array is on the adhesive platform with the fibered end of the array overhanging (Figure 6) to prevent the fibers from sticking to the adhesive and pulling off and to ensure a uniform Parylene coating on the fibers.\nCoat the arrays in a Parylene C deposition system to a thickness of 800 nm in a cleanroom, wearing appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) as defined by the individual cleanroom being used.\n\tNOTE: Here, PPE was defined as cleanroom shoes, suit, head covering, goggles, mask, and latex gloves. It should be noted that this is standard PPE for entering a cleanroom. This step can be outsourced to a Parylene coating company for a fee; however, a commercial service may be able to coat more arrays at one time. Each Parylene C deposition system may have different safety precautions. Contact the technician before use to ensure user safety.\nRemove the mating connector used as a mask from the Flex Array.\nPlace the arrays into a new box for storage until ready to use.\n7. Tip preparation methods",
    "NOTE: Two tip preparations in this section use lasers to cut fibers. Proper PPE, such as goggles resistant to the wavelengths used, should always be worn when using the laser, and other lab users in the vicinity of the laser should also be in PPE. Although fiber lengths listed in these steps are recommended lengths, users may try any length that suits their needs. The user must choose one of the following tip preparation methods as scissor cutting alone will not suffice to re-expose the electrode25.\nNeodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser cut\n\t\nCut the fibers to 550 µm with surgical scissors.\nUse a 532nm Nd:YAG pulsed laser (5 mJ/pulse, 5 ns duration, 900 mW) to cut 50 µm off the tip of the fibers to re-expose the carbon underneath the Parylene C (usually takes 2-3 pulses).\n\t\t\nAlign the fiber tips using the built-in stereoscope that comes with this laser system.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This system allows the user to align a window (here, 50 µm x 20 µm (height x width)) was used to encompass the end of the fiber.\nFocus the stereoscope on the end of the fiber at 500x magnification for an accurate and precise cut.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Parylene C will ablate slightly (<10 µm) from the tip leaving a blunt, cylindrical tip.\nBlowtorch Sharpening25,26,27\nCut the fibers to 300 µm with surgical scissors.\nSubmerge the array in a dish of deionized water, connector side down, and secured to the bottom of the dish with a small amount of putty.\nUse a pen camera to align the fibers with the surface of the water so that the fibers are just barely touching the surface of the water.",
    "Adjust a butane blowtorch flame to 3-5 mm and run it over the top of the fibers in a back-and-forth motion to sharpen fibers.\n\t\tNOTE: Fiber tips will glow orange when the flame passes over them.\nRemove the array from the putty and inspect it under a stereoscope for pointed tips under 50x magnification.\n\t\tNOTE: If pointed tips are observed, then no further blowtorching is necessary. If tips appear blunt, repeat steps 7.2.2-7.2.5.\nUV laser cut28\n\t​NOTE: UV Laser can only be used on zero insertion force (ZIF) and Wide Board designs at present due to the large focal point of the UV Laser used being larger than the pitch of the Flex Array carbon fibers.\n\t\nCut the carbon fibers to 1 mm with surgical scissors.\nAffix a UV laser to three orthogonally configured motorized stages.\n\t\tNOTE: The UV laser is a multimode Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) semiconductor with 1.5 W output power and 405 nm wavelength.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the laser has a continuous beam for fast and effective alignment and cutting.\nSecure the array in place to keep a still, level plane of electrodes for the laser to pass over. Ensure that array is held at an appropriate distance from the laser so that the fibers will be in light with the laser's focal point. To do this, provide a lower power to the laser and adjust the distance to best focus on the fiber28.\nMove the UV laser focal point across the fiber plane at a speed of 25 µm/s to cut the fibers to the desired length (here, all fibers are cut to 500 µm).\n\t\t​NOTE: Fibers will emit a bright light before being cut. Store the fibers after treatment until they are ready to be coated with a conductive polymer.",
    "8. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):p-toluenesulfonate (PEDOT:pTS) conductive coating for lowered impedance\nMix solutions of 0.01 M 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and 0.1 M sodium p-toluenesulfonate in 50 mL of DI water and stir overnight on a stir plate (~450 rpm) or until no particulates can be observed in the solution.\n\tNOTE: Store the solution in a light-resistant container. Refrigerate the solution after mixing to keep the solution useable for up to 30 days.\nRun a 1 kHz impedance scan using the same parameters as before (steps 5.2-5.3) in 1x PBS. Note which fibers have a good connection (<1 MΩ, typically 14-16 of 16 fibers).\nElectroplate with PEDOT:pTS to lower the impedance of the electrodes.\n\t\nSubmerge the fiber tips in PEDOT:pTS solution.\nFollow the steps outlaid in step 5.2, switching the 1x PBS solution out for PEDOT:pTS and short all connections to the board to the applied current channel.\nApply 600 pA per good fiber for 600 s using a potentiostat.\nTurn the cell off and allow it to rest for 5 s at the end of the run.\nRemove the fibers from the solution and rinse them in DI water.\nRetake 1 kHz impedances to check that the fibers were successfully coated (use the same parameters listed in steps 5.2-5.3).\n\tNOTE: Good fibers are designated as any fiber having an impedance of less than 110 kΩ.\n9. Connecting ground and reference wires\nGently scrape away Parylene C from the ground and reference vias on the board using tweezers. Short the ground and reference vias together in pairs on this board design.\n\tNOTE: Ground and reference vias can be found near the connector on the Flex array and are the four small gold circles near the connectors. Users will only need to remove Parylene C from the vias closest to the carbon fibers for measurements.",
    "Cut two 5 cm lengths of insulated silver wire with a razor blade. Deinsulate the ends of the wires 2-3 mm from one end to be attached to the Flex Array and ~10 mm from the opposite ends to allow for easier grounding and referencing during surgery.\nHeat the soldering iron back to 600 °F. Apply a small amount of flux to the vias.\nInsert one wire (2-3 mm exposed end) into each of the ePhys vias on the board. Apply solder to the top of the vias (Figure 7A). Allow the probe to cool, then flip it over to apply a small amount of solder to the backside of the via (Figure 7A).\nUsing surgical scissors, snip off any exposed wire sticking out of the back solder mound as this helps reduce noise seen in recording (Figure 7B).\nPlace the arrays back into the storage box, bending the wires back and away from the fiber. Secure the wires on the adhesive tape to prevent potential fiber-wire interactions (Figure 7C).\n10. Surgical procedure\nNOTE: Rat cortex was used to test the efficacy of the UV Laser-prepared fibers as this has been described previously7,20. These probes will work in nerve due to their similar geometry and impedance levels to blowtorch prepared fibers. This surgery was performed with an abundance of caution to validate that the UV laser did not change the response of the electrodes.\nAnesthetize an adult male Long Evans rat using a combination of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Confirm anesthesia with a toe pinch test. Apply ointment to the eyes to prevent the rat's eyes from drying out during the surgery.",
    "Create a 2 mm x 2 mm craniotomy above the right hemisphere's motor cortex. Identify the lower left corner of the craniotomy by measuring 1 mm anterior of bregma and 1 mm lateral of midline.\nMount the array into a stereotaxic instrument, and zero the stereotaxic instrument at the dura by gently lowering the fibers until they touch the dura's surface. Raise the array away from the surgical site and move it to the side until it is ready for insertion.\nResect the dura by gently pulling a needle with a barbed end over the surface of the tissue. Once a portion of the dura opens to the brain, use a pair of fine forceps to further assist in pulling away the dura.\nInsert the fibers into the craniotomy and 1.2 mm into the brain using a stereotaxic instrument, lowering slowly by hand.\nRecord ePhys data for 10 min with an ePhys-specific headstage and preamplifier.\n\t\nSet the preamplifier high-pass filter to process the signal at 2.2 Hz, antialias at 7.5 kHz, and sample at 25 kHz.\n\t\tNOTE: For these measurements, only spontaneous activity is recorded. No stimulus is applied.\nEuthanasia\n\t\nPlace the rat under isoflurane at 5% under 1 L/min of oxygen until signs of life have ceased (20-30 min). Confirm euthanasia with decapitation.\n11. Spike sorting\nUse spike-sorting software to sort and analyze the data using previously reported methods8.\nUse a high-pass filter on all channels (250 Hz corner, 4th order Butterworth), and set the waveform detection level to -3.5 × RMS threshold.\n\t\nUse a Gaussian model to cluster and spikes with similar characteristics. Combine and average clusters of at least 10 waveforms to include in further analysis.\nEliminate or delete all waveforms that are not spikes from the data set.",
    "Export data once all channels have been sorted and use analysis software to plot and further analyze the waveforms.\n12. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) imaging\nNOTE: This step will render arrays unusable and should be used only to inspect tip treatment results to check that the arrays are being properly processed. This step does not need to be done to build a successful array. Summarized below is a general outline of the SEM process; however, users who have not previously used SEM should receive help from a trained user.\nSnip off the fibered end of the PCB and mount it on a carbon tape-masked SEM stub. Place the arrays on a small platform of stacked carbon tape (4-5 layers) to prevent the carbon fibers from sticking to the SEM stub.\nSputter-coat the arrays with gold (100-300 Å) following procedures outlined by the manufacturer of the gold sputter coater.\nTo inspect the tip treatment effects, image the arrays in an SEM at a working distance of 15 mm and 20 kV beam strength.\n\tNOTE: Arrays can be imaged without sputter-coating under a low vacuum, as shown in Figure 8D for UV laser-cut fibers. For this setup, it is recommended to have a working distance of 11-12 mm and a 4 kV beam strength.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
