  "procedures": [
    "A: HepG2 cells\n1. ca. 10<sup>5</sup> HepG2 cells are seeded into wells of a 12-well culture plate and incubated overnight \n  2. after washing twice with PBS, the cells are serum starved for 24 hrs\n  3. compounds are added in desired concentrations \\(SecinH3, D5 and Wortmannin or DMSO alone); final concentration of DMSO was 0.2% in our experiment\n  4. cells stimulated with 10 nM insulin for 12 hrs\n  5. Total RNA extracted with Absolutely RNA kit \\(Stratagene) according to instructions from manufacturer; elution volume 50 &#xB5;l\n  \nB: Mouse liver \n1. 10 mg liver homogenized in lysis buffer and RNA extracted with Absolutely RNA kit \\(Stratagene) according to instructions of manufacturer; elution volume 50 &#xB5;l\n  \nRT and real-time PCR\n1. RNA concentration determined by photometry \n  2. 2.5 &#xB5;g RNA used for reverse transcription with cDNA Archive kit \\(Applied Biosystems) according to instructions from manufacturer; RT volume: 50 &#xB5;l\n  3. resulting cDNA diluted 1:3 with H<sub>2</sub>O\n  4. quantitative PCR performed in 10 &#xB5;l scale with gene-specific TaqMan probes \\(Applied Biosystems). All expression-levels were normalized to the expression level of &#x3B2;-2-microglobulin."
