    "1. Construction of a model plasmid carrying an antibiotic resistance gene\nNOTE: The strain Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 was used as the model organism in all experiments (DSM No. 18039, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, DSMZ). The strain E. coli DH5α17 was used during plasmid construction.\nPCR amplify the plasmid backbone of your choice and amplify the resistance gene including the promoter region by PCR (Figure 1).\n\t\nPCR amplify the plasmid backbone using a high-fidelity polymerase and the oligonucleotides pBBR1_for (5'-GCGGCCACCGGCTGGCT-3') and pBBR1_rev (5'-TACCGGCGCGGCAGCGTGACCC-3') on the plasmid template pLC (GenBank acc. no. MH238456)18.\nPCR amplify the resistance gene nptII including the native Tn5 promoter19 using a high-fidelity polymerase and oligonucleotides nptII_gib_for (5'-GCGCCGGTAGATCTGCTCATGTTTGAAGCTTCACGCTGCCGCA-3') and nptII_gib_rev (5'-CGGTGGCCGCCAAAAAGGCCATCCGTCAGGTCAGAAGAACTCGT-3'). The nptII gene encodes for a neomycin phosphotransferase and confers resistance to kanamycin.\n\t\tNOTE: Design the primers for the resistance gene with approximately 20 bp of complementary sequence to the plasmid backbone that it will be fused to.\nClean both PCR fragments using a kit of your choice.\nJoin the purified antibiotic resistance gene PCR product (including its promoter region) to the purified plasmid backbone and fuse the homologous regions using isothermal assembly20, at 50 °C for 60 min.\nElectroporate the fused product into the strain E. coli DH5α.\n\t\nIntroduce 2 µL of the product from step 1.3 into 40 µL of electrocompetent cells in 2 mm cuvettes at 4 °C and 2.5 kV. Resuspend cells in 1 mL of lysogeny broth (LB) medium.\nTransfer the total volume to a microfuge tube and incubate 1 h at 37 °C shaking at 250 rpm in an orbital shaker to allow for the expression of the resistance marker on the plasmid.",
    "Plate 100 µL of the cells on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic (kanamycin 25 µg/mL) to select for the antibiotic resistance gene and thus select for plasmid-carrying cells. Spin down the rest, remove the supernatant, resuspend the cells in 100 µL LB and plate on a selective agar plate. Incubate the plates at 37 °C for 24 h.\nIn order to verify clones, extract the constructed plasmids via alkaline lysis using a commercial mini-prep kit.\n\t\nHarvest 5 mL of the stationary overnight culture by centrifuging at 12,000 x g at room temperature. Resuspend the cells in resuspension solution, then lyse and neutralize the cell solution. Centrifuge for 5 min at 12,000 x g.\nTransfer the supernatant to the DNA binding column provided in the kit and wash the column twice with 500 µL washing solution centrifuging 2x before eluting the column membrane with elution buffer.\nPerform Sanger sequencing of the plasmid to confirm that the sequence is correct.\nOnce the plasmid validity is verified, electroporate the plasmid (now pCON) into the strain E. coli MG1655 as described above. This yields strain E. coli MG1655 pCON.\n2. Monitoring plasmid-carrying bacteria under various conditions over time\nNOTE: The evolution experiment is conducted with plasmid-carrying strains under nonselective conditions (LB media) in two temperatures (37 °C and 20 °C) and three population bottleneck sizes. The experimental design is used to study plasmid persistence under various conditions.\nDesign of an evolution experiment to follow plasmid frequency over time (Figure 2)\n\t\nPlate the constructed plasmid-carrying strain (E. coli MG1655 pCON) on LB agar plates supplemented with antibiotics (kanamycin 25 µg/mL) and incubate overnight at 37 °C.",
    "Prepare 96 deep-well plates with 1 mL of LB medium in each well. As the bacterial ancestors, pick eight random isolated colonies from the agar plate in independent wells. Incubate the plates at 37 °C and 450 rpm on a plate shaker for 24 h. Prepare a frozen glycerol stock of the ancestral clones.\nThe next day transfer the eight replicate populations into new deep-well plates according to the experimental design (Figure 2). The cultures are diluted 1:100 (large bottleneck, L), 1:1,000 (medium bottleneck, M), or 1:10,000 (small bottleneck, S) in a total volume of 1 mL LB using PBS for dilution. The diluted cultures are both incubated at 37 °C and 20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: It is highly important to control for cross-contamination in the 96-deep-well plate. Thus, use a checkerboard plate design by intercalating inoculated wells with bacteria-free LB medium. Use this pattern through the entire evolution experiment.\nThe cultures incubated at 37 °C are transferred every 12 h while cultures at 20 °C are transferred every 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: During every transfer event the bottleneck size treatment is applied and the serial transfer is repeated over a total of 98 transfers. The number of transfers will depend on the readers' experimental design.\nPrepare a frozen glycerol stock of all the populations regularly, 2x a week.\nMonitoring the plasmid frequency by replica plating (Figure 3)\n\tNOTE: During the evolution experiment, the frequency of plasmid-carrying cells in the population is estimated from the proportion of hosts. The replica plating protocol is shown in Figure 3.\n\t\nTo determine the plasmid frequency in the population during the evolution experiment, stationary cultures are serially diluted and plated on nonselective LB agar plates. Adjust the dilution according to a yield of 250-500 colonies per plate.",
    "NOTE: Prepare thick LB agar plates prior to the plating (~30 mL agar).\nThe plated populations are incubated for overnight growth according to their growth temperature in the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: The colonies need to be small, thus incubate <24 h at 37 °C.\nAfter overnight growth, count all colonies using a manual or automated colony count station and calculate the total bacterial population size in the cultures.\n\t\tNOTE: Colonies at the edge of the agar plate should not be included in the total bacterial cell count.\nSterilize square pieces (~20 x 20 cm) of cotton velvet by autoclaving.\n\t\tNOTE: The velvet cloth needs to be 100% cotton to be autoclavable. It is important to dry the cloth after sterilization.\nAfter sterilization of the velvet cloth, place the cloth on a round block and fix it with a metal ring. It is crucial to avoid wrinkles. Carefully place the plate with the grown colonies (agar facing down) on the fixed velvet cloth surface. Make sure that all colonies touch the velvet surface by carefully tapping on the Petri dish in a circular manner.\nCarefully remove the LB agar plate and place a selective plate supplemented with antibiotics (kanamycin 25 µg/mL) onto the velvet cloth. Make sure the plate is touching all the velvet by carefully tapping on the Petri dish as described before. Afterwards, remove the plate. Leave the plates at room temperature for overnight growth.",
    "The next day, evaluate both the LB agar plate and the selective plate. Colonies that grow on the selective media are counted as plasmid hosts (i.e., antibiotic resistant), while colony-free spots are colonies that were plasmid-free and are thus not resistant to the antibiotic (i.e., lost the plasmid). This is done by placing the plates over each other and comparing the growth (i.e., mark any missing colonies) and counting the colony number on both plates. This yields the number of cells that lost the plasmid during the evolution experiment.\nRepeat this procedure along the whole evolution experiment in a regular manner (e.g., every 14 transfers).\n3. Visualization of plasmid multimers using gel electrophoresis\nNOTE: Plasmid extraction of low-copy plasmids often leads to contamination with host chromosomal DNA that needs to be enzymatically digested prior to visualization.\nExtract plasmid DNA from a 5 mL stationary overnight cell culture using alkaline lysis as described in step 1.5.\nAfterwards, treat the extracted plasmid DNA with an ATP-dependent DNase that only cuts chromosomal DNA to remove chromosomal DNA contamination (see Table of Materials). Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, clean the DNA using a kit of your choice.\nTo create open circle molecules of all plasmid conformations (monomers or multimers), incubate the plasmid DNA samples with a nicking enzyme (Nb.BsrDI) and incubate for 30 min at 65 °C.\nIn parallel, to create linear plasmid molecules (i.e., for plasmid size comparison), use a restriction enzyme of your choice (e.g., HindIII) that cleaves the plasmid once.\n\tNOTE: This results in linear DNA plasmid monomers. Open circle molecules do not migrate in a linear manner.",
    "To visualize the plasmid size and conformation, electrophorese the nicked and linear plasmid DNA samples for 120 min at 4.3 V/cm in a 1% (w/v) agarose gel and 1× TAE buffer. The samples are stained with Midori green and the gel is visualized on a gel imaging system (see Table of Materials). Use a 1 kbp ladder."
