    "1. Preparation of Cells\nMaintain NAMRU mouse mammary gland epithelial cells (NMuMG cells) with 5 mL of D-MEM containing 10% (v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v) Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S) in a 25 cm3 flask. Remove Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (D-MEM), containing 10% FBS and 1% P/S.\nAdd 3-5 mL of 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (-) to the flask. Note that the pH of PBS is 7.1-7.3.\nRemove all the PBS from the flask using an aspirator.\nAdd 1.5 mL of 37 °C trypsin (0.25%, w/v) to the flask.\nIncubate the flask for approximately 1-2 minutes at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.\nAdd 3.5 mL of D-MEM containing 10% FBS and 1% P/S to the flask. Pipette to mix.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge it for 3 min at room temperature. Note that the rotation radius and rotation speed of the centrifuge are 16.6 cm and 1500 rpm, respectively. Under this condition, the relative centrifugal force is 417 x g.\nAdd 5 mL of fresh D-MEM (10% FBS and 1% P/S) to the flask after aspirating the medium (if required, cryopreserve the cells with cryopreservation solution, following the manufacturer's directions).\n2. Preparation of Dextran (DEX)\nPrepare 80 mg/mL of DEX solution by mixing 10 mL of D-MEM (10% FBS, 1%P/S) and 0.8 g of DEX. Note that the DEX solution can be filtered with a syringe filter (0.22 µm) after the cells have cultured for a sufficient time.\nPrepare a cell suspension containing 40 mg/mL DEX medium by mixing 200 µL of DEX solution and 200 µL of the cell suspension prepared in 2.1. Note that the number density of cells in the solution is approximately 2.3×105 cells/mL.\n3. Preparation for Laser and Microscopy",
    "Turn on the laser (continuous wave, 1,064 nm wavelength) (Figure 1a). Note that the use of a laser beam with a wavelength in the red to near-infrared region is most effective; this wavelength region is called the diagnostic and therapeutic window10 since it is minimally absorbed by cells.\nDouble-click the software icon.\nDouble-click the icons for the ① camera, ② light-emitting diode (LED), ③ focus adjust, and ④ moving stage. The displays corresponding to ①-④ will show up (Figure 1b).\n4. Cell Manipulation using the Laser Trapping System\nPlace 20 µL of the sample prepared in step 2.2 on the bottom cover glass (0.17 mm thickness, size = 30 mm × 40 mm), and cover it with the top cover glass (0.17 mm thickness, size = 18 mm × 18 mm), with separation provided by two spacers (0.17 mm thickness, size = 10 mm × 24 mm), as shown in Figure 2. Note that these glasses do not require a special coating.\nPlace the sample cell prepared in step 4.1 on the lower objective Lens (water immersion with ca. 10 μl, magnification = 60X, working distance = 0.28 mm, numerical aperture = 1.2)).\nAttach the upper objective lens (water immersion with ca. 10 μl, magnification = 60X, working distance = 2 mm, numerical aperture = 1.0) at the top of the sample cell.\nTurn on the LED light by clicking icon 2 (Figure 1b).\nAdjust the distance between the sample and the lower objective lens by clicking the icons on panel 3 (Figure 1b) until it is in focus.\nIrradiate the laser beams at Position 1 and Position 2 (Figure 1B) of the sample by clicking icons I, II, and III (Figure 1b).",
    "Set the intensity of each laser beam to 1,500 mW by entering this value at icon IV (Figure 1b).\nMove the sample stage by clicking icon 4 indicating directions (Figure 1b) until a cell is trapped at Position 1 (Figure 1b).\nDrag the cursor indicating Position 2 (Figure 1b) until another cell is trapped at Position 2.\n5. Construction of a 3-Dimensional (3D) Cell Structure\nManipulate a single cell so that it is in contact with another cell. Maintain this condition for 300 s; i.e., each cell is exposed to a laser for 300 s.\nRecord the X-Y axis shown in Figure 1b.\nConstruct an arbitrary 2D cell assembly by trapping and transporting another cell to the cells.\nConstruct a 3D cellular assembly by moving the stage up and down.\nConfirm that the assembly remains stable after the laser is switched off."
