    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn this protocol the user will find instructions how to: (1) Measure intra-kinetochore Delta Euclidian distances between two fluorescently-labeled kinetochore markers – steps 1–6, 9, 10, 12–14; (2) Measure intra-kinetochore Delta Euclidian distances between three fluorescently-labeled kinetochore markers – steps 1–7, 9, 10, 12–14; (3) Measure intra-kinetochore Delta Euclidian distance between two fluorescently-labeled kinetochore markers at kinetochores positive and negative for a third fluorescently-labeled kinetochore marker – steps 1–6, 8, 9, 10, 12–15; and (4) Quantify kinetochore marker intensity – complete step 11 after any of the above analysis.\nFor more information on the workflows see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1176-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Workflows for Delta Euclidian distance inflation corrected measurements (ΔEC) between kinetochore components and kinetochore intensity measurements\nThe protocol contains the steps for four workflows depending on the desired output: (1) For ΔEC measurement between two fluorescently labeled kinetochore proteins, follow steps 1–6, 9, 10, 12–14. (2) For ΔEC measurements between three fluorescently labeled kinetochore proteins (in pairs), follow steps 1–7, 9, 10, 12–14. (3) For ΔEC measurements between two fluorescently labeled kinetochore proteins at kinetochore marker positive and negative kinetochores, follow steps 1–7, 9, 10, 12–14. (4) For kinetochore intensity measurements, perform step 11 after any of the previous workflows.\nRaw data collection\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis section describes the procedure for collecting the data on the approximate chromatic shift (ACS) correction and the sample of interest: how to grow human adherent cells, prepare immunofluorescent sample, image the sample and export the data.\nApproximate chromatic shift (ACS) slide preparation and imaging.",
    "Note: The ACS analysis (step 3) detects the shift between the kinetochore spots detected in different fluorescent channels for the same marker, i.e. if there is no chromatic shift the spots should perfectly colocalize. Next, in the sample analysis (step 4), the detected sample spot coordinates are corrected for the calculated shift. However, the ACS alone is not sufficiently precise for Delta analysis and further chromatic shift correction is applied in step 10.\nAdherent human cell culture: This step provides guidance on how to sub-culture human HTERT-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial (hTERT RPE1) cells. However, other adhesive cell types as well as other organisms can also be potentially used.\nNote: this is a standard protocol for culturing human hTERT RPE1 cells used for the development of this protocol. However, the user can also use media variations and acquire the reagents from other companies.\nMaintenance of hTERT RPE1 cells: cells should be grown in a humidified incubator at 37° and 5% CO2. The cells are seeded and grown in T25 or T75 single use sterile flasks containing Dulbecco′s Modified Eagle′s Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F12), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL streptomycin.",
    "Sub-culture of the cells: When the cells reach about 85% confluency in the flask, the cells need to be sub-cultured for maintenance or to be seeded onto coverslips for an experiment. To sub-culture the cells the following steps are performed in a laminar flow cabinet using sterile equipment. First, discard the media in which the cells are grown. Then wash the T25 flask bottom with 5 mL PBS, and discard the PBS. Next, add 1 mL 0.05% Trypsin EDTA to the T25 flask. The trypsin will detach the cells from the flask bottom and break-down the adherence between cells. Place the flask in the incubator for 3 min or until the cells are floating in the solution. The user can check under brightfield illumination. In the meantime, add 5 mL supplemented DMEM/F-12 to a new T25 flask. Label the flask with date, cell passage, name, and cell line, or as the user sees fit. Once the cells become detached, add 4 mL supplemented DMEM/F-12 media and gently mix by pipetting. For maintenance add 1/10 of the cell suspension (0.5 mL) to the new T25 flask and return to incubator. This will be ready for sub-culturing again in 3 days. To seed cells for immunofluorescence experiment, add a sterile coverslip to the well of a 6-well plate (this is one sample, do as many as required for the desired experiment). Then add 2 mL of supplemented DMEM/F-12 to the well containing the cover slip. Finally, add 500 mL of the cell suspension created above to the well. The cells will be ready for fixation in two days (see step b).\nNote: The coverslip size and thickness should be chosen such that it best fits the used microscope. We suggest use of N1.5 coverslip, 22 by 22 mm square.",
    "Freezing and storage of cells. To freeze cells, first prepare a T75 flask by adding 15 mL supplemented DMEM/F-12 and 1.5 mL of the cell suspension from step ii. above. Grow the cells for two days. Then, discard the media and wash the flask bottom with 10 mL PBS and discard the PBS. Add 2 mL trypsin-EDTA to the flask and incubate for 2 min or until the cells have detached. Add 8 mL of supplemented DMEM/F-12 media and gently mix by pipetting. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15mL falcon tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 1200 rpm. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in 10mL freezing medium. The Freezing medium recipe is: 10% DMSO, 17% FBS and 73% non-supplemented DMEM/F-12. Add 1 mL from the cell suspension in freezing media to a cryotube. Place the cryotube in a freezing container (to slow down cooling temperature to around 1°C/min) and place at -80 for about 24 h. Transfer to liquid nitrogen storage on the following day.\nImmunofluorescence protocol: the following immunofluorescence protocol has been tested on human hTERT-RPE1 and HeLa K cells and used for development of this methodology Here, the cells are ‘‘fixed’’ by cross-linking the proteins in the sample via a paraformaldehyde-containing solution. The user can also use alternative fixation protocols, as long as the recommended controls in the ‘‘Before you begin’’ section give similar results. The following steps do not require sterile environment.\nPrepare PTEMF (fixation solution) - 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10mM EGTA (pH = 7), 20mM Pipes (pH = 6.8), 1mM MgCl2, and double distilled water. Always prepare fresh on the day of fixation. About 2 mL per sample is sufficient.",
    "Critical: To obtain best fluorescent staining, the user is recommended to be careful to not dry out the cover slip.\nCritical: Always wear PPE and use fume cabinet with airflow when working with PTEMF – paraformaldehyde is highly toxic!\nGently discard the media with Pasteur pipette. Try not to touch the cells on the coverslip.\nNote: Tilting the 6-well plate at about 60 degrees from the bench will ease discarding and adding solutions without disturbing the cover slip.\nAdd PTEMF to the well with a Pasteur pipette such that the PTEMF covers the cover slip with cells, about 2mL. Incubate for 10 min at 20°C–26°C. In the incubation time, prepare 3% Bovine Serum Albumine (BSA) in PBS solution.\nNote: BSA is very sticky. Add the BSA powder to the PBS and let it dissolve. Do not stir.\nNote: The 3% BSA in PBS solution can also be prepared before you begin the fixation of the cells. However, it should be prepared fresh on the day when it will be used.\nWashes: Discard the PTEMF in a bottle for toxic waste with a Pasteur Pipette. With a Pasteur pipette add PBS enough to cover the coverslip (about 1.5 mL). Incubate for 5 min at 20°C–26°C. Discard the first PBS wash in the bottle for toxic waste, and add fresh PBS as before. Incubate for 5 min at 20°C–26°C. Discard the PBS in non-toxic waste container. After the first wash, only traces of Paraformaldehyde remain and the following washes are thus non-toxic. Add fresh PBS as before and incubate for 5 min at 20°C–26°C .\nPause point: To pause for up to 24 h, add fresh PBS to the sample, making sure the cover slip is covered, and place the 6-well plate at 4°C.",
    "Blocking: Discard the PBS with a Pasteur pipette. Add 3% BSA in PBS, such that it covers the cover slip (~ 1.5 mL). Incubate for 30 min at 20°C–26°C.\nNote: Why we do “blocking” - The BSA protein in the blocking solution is “sticky” and binds to the coverslip glass. Therefore, it “blocks” the non-specific binding sites of the antibodies on the glass cover slip, and decreases the extent of non-specific binding by the primary and secondary antibodies.\nNote: The incubation can be extended up to about 2 h without affecting the sample.\nIn the blocking incubation time, prepare the following “antibody incubation chamber”: cut a square of thick filter paper such that it can fit in a 15 cm diameter plastic tissue culture dish. Wet the filter paper with tap water and place it in the 15 cm dish. Cut a piece of parafilm, roughly the size of the filter paper and place on top of the filter paper.\nNote: the following sub-steps of iii. are to be done immediately before the blocking time is over to prevent degradation of the antibody.\nDilute the primary antibody in 3% BSA in PBS to the working dilution recommended for immunofluorescence, such that a single final mix containing all primary antibodies is obtained. Vortex the mixture. The working dilutions for commercially available antibodies tested for this protocol are given in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nCritical: the stained kinetochore marker needs to (1) be present in interphase cells and (2) stain well in Gaussian spot shape manner, i.e. CenpA or CenpC (avoid use of anti-centromere antibodies, known as CREST antibodies, which often results in a “spread” signal).\nPlace 100 μL of the antibody mix in a drop on the parafilm in the “antibody incubation chamber”.",
    "With forceps carefully take the cover slip out of the 6-well plate, holding it near the edges. Discard the liquid by holding the cover slip vertical and tapping the edge onto a tissue. Place the cover slip on top of liquid drop in the “antibody incubation chamber”. Close the 15 cm dish.\nCritical: Make sure the cells on the cover slip are facing down in the “antibody incubation chamber”. In the 6-well plate, the cells are on top of the cover slip.\nIncubate for 1 h at 20°C–26°C.\nCut a piece of parafilm and place it on top of a 6-well plate lid.\nCarefully, take the cover slip with forceps from the “antibody incubation chamber” and discard the liquid by holding the cover slip horizontally and tapping the edge onto a tissue.\nPlace the cover slip with cells facing up onto the parafilm on top of the 6-well plate. Repeat the following procedure 3 times: Add ~1 mL PBS with a Pasteur pipette and incubate for 5 min. Discard the PBS with Pasteur pipette or aspirator set at minimum speed. Do not discard the PBS after the last wash.\nWipe the parafilm in the “antibody incubation chamber” with a tissue such that none of the primary antibody mix liquid remains. Dilute the secondary antibodies in 3% BSA in PBS to the same working dilution, creating equal mixture. Vortex the mixture.\nPlace a 100 μL of the antibody mix in a drop on the parafilm in the “antibody incubation chamber”.",
    "With forceps carefully take the cover slip out of the 6-well plate, holding it near the edges. Discard the liquid by holding the cover slip vertical and tapping the edge onto a tissue. Place the cover slip on top of liquid drop in the “antibody incubation chamber”. Close the 15 cm dish. Cover the dish with foil to prevent bleaching of the fluorescence.\nCritical: Make sure the cells on the cover slip are facing down in the “antibody incubation chamber”. On the 6-well plate lid, the cells are on top of the cover slip.\nIncubate for 30 min at 20°C–26°C.\nWash the coverslip by following steps xi to xiii.\nClean a microscope slide with a piece of tissue and label the slide appropriately.\nAdd a drop of VectaShield in the middle of the microscope slide (about 20 μL).\nWith forceps carefully take the cover slip out of the 6-well plate, holding it near the edges.\nDiscard the liquid by holding the cover slip vertical and tapping the edge onto a tissue.\nPlace the cover slip on top of the VectaShield drop. Do not move the slide after placing to prevent smudging of the cells.\nSeal the cover slip to the microscope slide by applying nail varnish to the edges.\nCover the slides with opaque box or foil and leave horizontally to dry. Leave for 1–2 h at 20°C–26°C or for about 12 h at 4°C.\nKeep the slides in microscope slides box at 4°C when not in use.",
    "Image the ACS: See the before you begin section for details on the choice of imaging set up. This protocol has been tested on spinning disk microscope with pixel size 0.069 nm in the xy plane. Other microscopes with similar resolution, i.e., with similar pixel size and objective can also be used (see steps 1–3). Take a 12 micrometer unit z-stack, at 100 nm z-step intervals (121 images), aiming for one or two interphase cells in the center of the field of view. Choose the z sampling such that it is Nyquist sampling or lower (see steps 1–3). Take a dataset of 10 to 15 images of different cells for a given day of imaging. For example: For the development of the protocol, we used a confocal microscope with Nyquist sampling calculated as above to be 135 nm. However, as described above, due to the microscope characteristics we could increase the sampling up to 228 nm without significantly reducing the resolution. For the ACS imaging, we used 100 nm z sampling (oversampling) to ensure we capture significant information for as accurate as possible estimation of the chromatic shift.\nCritical: The user is advised to adjust the acquisition settings such that the spot signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is higher than 2.\nNote: The z-stack size is chosen to be 12 μm as this is enough to sample a full mitotic human cell. If the user is studying another subject with different depth, the z-stack size is to be optimized accordingly. However, the user should consider that if a much larger object is imaged in depth, the resolution may be affected.",
    "Critical: The ACS dataset is a control for the optical alignment of the microscope. The microscope optical alignment could change over time. Therefore, the ACS dataset should be imaged on the day of sample imaging.\nNote: For ACS, interphase cells are used instead of fluorescent beads as they better represent the diffraction in a cellular environment. Therefore, initial microscope alignment can be performed by beads but for detection of day-to-day alignment variations and correction in the software, the described ACS slide is recommended. Here, interphase cells are used instead of mitotic cells to facilitate data acquisition and analysis (only ~2–10% of hTERT RPE1 cells in culture are in mitosis).\nCritical: The KiDv1.0.1 software supports only three fluorescent channels and any additional channels are not seen in the analysis. If the user would like to acquire images in channels that would not be used in analysis (such as DAPI), the user should acquire in those channels last, i.e. the first three acquired channels should be the channels used for analysis if more than three channels are acquired.\nExport all images as ome.tif or .r3d files.\nNote: If the microscope does not support one of those formats (such as 3i systems which use SlideBook), open the image in Fiji and save it as ome.tif file.\nNote: The user is advised to include consecutive numbering in the image names for the acquired images in a sample. Image stack numbering is not required by the software but will facilitate relating the analysis in KiDv1.0.1 to the original file number. For example: Initials_date_chromaticshift_protein_colors_number: TG_01062021_chromaticshift_CenpA_488561647_01\nSample preparation.",
    "This protocol is developed for human adherent cells. An example of how to grow and maintain human non-transformed hTERT RPE1 cells is provided in 1 a. To prepare hTERT RPE1 mitotic cells for immunofluorescence follow the instructions in step 1 a ii.\nImmunofluorescence: the fixation and immunostaining are performed as in step 1 b, except the following considerations:\nThe user is not limited to antibodies and can also use fluorescently tagged proteins for labeling of kinetochore markers.\nCritical: If fluorescent proteins are used for the labeling, always cover the sample with foil in the incubation times to prevent photo bleaching.\nWhen adding and discarding solutions, the user is advised to do it gently, especially before the cells are fixed in PTEMF. This is specifically necessary for mitotic sample preparations to prevent detachment of the mitotic cells and their loss.\nNote: When hTERT RPE1 cells enter mitosis, they round up and are not that adherent to the dish.\nPrimary antibodies – the user is recommended to use up to three primary antibodies as the software can process up to three kinetochore markers labeled in different fluorescent channels.\nCritical: Use antibodies raised in different species so they can be recognized by different secondary antibodies and this way labeled in different colors.\nSecondary antibodies: for the development of this protocol we used the Alexa fluorescently conjugated antibodies specified in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. The user is recommended to use these antibodies where fitting the primary antibody species as we have shown these antibodies to work with the above protocol.\nCritical: Use secondary antibodies raised against the primary antibody species.\nImage the sample with the same microscope set up as the ACS slide and as described in the “Before you begin” section.",
    "Critical: We advise the user to optimize the image acquisition such that the SNR is between 2 and 3. Images with higher SNR can also be used. Directions on troubleshooting and optimization in the cases when not sufficient spots are detected are available in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section and later in the protocol.\nNote: In our experience, dataset of 17 to 24 cells per experiment is typically sufficient to produce a dataset of 300-500 kinetochores, depending on the quality of the signal.\nCritical: We do not recommend oversampling in the z direction when imaging the sample. As discussed before, for our imaging system the Nyquist sampling is 135 nm and can be increased to 228 without significantly decreasing the resolution. Therefore, for sample imaging we used 200 nm sampling in z.\nCritical: The KiDv1.0.1 software supports only three fluorescent channels and any additional channels are not seen in the analysis. If the user would like to acquire images in channels that would not be used in the analysis (such as DAPI), the user should acquire in those channels last, i.e. the first three acquired channels should be the channels used for analysis if more than three channels are used.\nExport all images as ome.tif or .r3d files.\nNote: The user is advised to include consecutive numbering in the image names for the acquired images in a sample. Image stack numbering is not required by the software but will facilitate relating the analysis number in KiDv1.0.1 to the original file number.\nEntering raw data in KiDv1.0.1 and setting up the analysis\nTiming: 2–6 h for step 3\nTiming: 2–6 h for step 4",
    "This section provides instructions how to (1) use the KiDv1.0.1 Graphical User Interface (GUI), (2) input raw data and specifications and (3) select the analysis to perform. All of this information is saved in a jobset file.\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCritical: Every time the user closes and opens MATLAB, the user should add the “KiDv1.0.1” and “BEDCA” folders to the MATLAB path, see step 7b from the \"Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]\" section.\nProcessing the ACS data troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] In this step the user will input the ACS images in KiDv1.0.1 in the form of a jobset (jS) file that contains information about the data, analysis set up, and once it is processed at the end of step 3, also the initial raw data analysis. For more information about the ACS correction see step 1.\nNote: at the end of step 3, the jobset analysis will be automatically saved in the folder with the raw data.\nCreating a jobset(jS) file. In the Command window type jS_Name = kitGUI, where jS_Name is the name under which the analysis performed in this section will be saved.

    "Note: The user is advised to use informative naming. Here, we suggest a naming system that has been used for the set of experiments in Roscioli et al. However, the user can develop their own naming system as appropriate.\nMovie and ROI selection\nClick on Select directory. Select the folder that contains the ACS images and click on Select Folder. You can now see the path of the selected folder on the right of the Select directory button, and all of the files in the selected folder in the Available movies window.\nOptional: If the user has already saved a jobset (at the end of step 3) and wishes to edit it, the user can click on Open existing jobset.\nNote: Folders opened through the KiD1.0.1 GUI do not need to be added to the MATLAB path as they do not contain MATLAB code.\nIn the Available movies window, select the image stacks that are to be used for ACS correction by clicking with left mouse button on the stack – it will become highlighted in blue.\nNote: You can select multiple image stacks at once by selecting the first image, holding Shift and selecting the last image, or by selecting one image and holding Command to select the rest.\nClick on Add full. This will enter the full image size for each selected image stack to the bottom of the list in the ROIs window. The image stacks used for ACS correction contain interphase cells and thus cropping is not required.\nNote: If the user has made a mistake, an ROI can be deleted by selecting it with left mouse button and clicking Delete. The ROI can also be viewed in similar manner using the View button.",
    "Repeat steps ii. and iii. until all ACS images are added to the ROIs window.\nProcess setup\nIn the Process type drop down menu select Chromatic Shift.\nIn the coordinate system (CS) channel pick the fluorophore channel with the best signal. Here O1 is the first, O2 is the second, and O3 is the third acquired channel.\nCritical: To choose the best channel, the user is recommended to first choose the channel with best signal-to-noise ratio (ideally greater than 2) and run all of the sub-steps in step 3. After the job has been processed in step 3. the user is recommended to check the number of detected spots per image stack (see step 3 f.). Since healthy human cells have 46 kinetochores in interphase, we expect to be able to detect close to this number of spots. If the average number of detected spots per cell is 23 or more (50% of total), the user can proceed using this channel as the coordinate system channel in further experiments. If the detection yields less than 50% of the expected number of spots per cell then the channel is sub-optimal. The user is therefore recommended to re-load the jobset (as in step 3 b i. Optional), and amend it such that another channel is the coordinate system channel. Then again check the total yield of the detection. If all of the channels are sub-optimal, the user is suggested to consult with the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] provided. For example: for ACS correction slide, cells are stained with anti-CenpA primary antibody labeled with a mixture of A488-, A561- and A647-conjugated secondary antibodies. Here, running step 3 with Channel2 (CenpC-A561) as coordinate system channel yields 775 spots after processing of 10 ACS image stacks. Therefore, Channel2 (CenpC-A561) is selected for coordinate system channel by selecting O2.",
    "The detection method for the CS channel is automatically set to Histogram and the refinement to MMF. Using these parameters, KiDv1.0.1 will first detect spots in the CS channel via unimodal histogram thresholding. In this method, the histogram of all signal intensities is used to determine the threshold that discriminates between signal and background noise. Next, KiDv1.0.1 models the spots based on the default PSF and detects the likely candidates. Finally, the detected spots are refined using Gaussian mixture model fitting (MMF) and their centers are detected. The MMF function checks how many Gaussian spots best explain the detected signal and improves kinetochore detection in cases of two nearby or overlapping kinetochore signals.\nNote: The options in the KiDv1.0.1 GUI is denoted here with semicolon before the option such as :Histogram.\nSet the detection in the non-coordinate system (NCS) channels with kinetochore marker to :Neighbor and the refinement to :MMF. The NCS channels are all acquired channels with kinetochore marker except the channel selected as CS channel in step ii. The option :Neighbor allows the software to search for the spot signal in a NCS channel within a :Circle or :Semi-circle (see mask options, step d ii.) centered at the corresponding spot coordinates in the CS channel.",
    "Note: The :Semi-circle mask is used only when there is a metaphase plate such that the :Semi-circle can be oriented relative to the metaphase plate. In all other cases, the :Circle option is used. This protocol uses interphase cells for ACS correction and in interphase cells there is no metaphase plate. Therefore, for ACS processing the :Circle option is the only one that can be used. The user will encounter the :Semi-circle mask when processing the sample. For example: for CenpA-A488-A561-A647, the CS Channel is Channel2 (CenpA-A647). Therefore, the NCS channels are Channel1 (CenpA-A488) and Channel3 (CenpA-A647).\nNote: Through this setup the best signal is used for primary spot detection, while the detection in the other channels is facilitated by searching only in a mask with a set shape and radius from the primary identified spot.\nOptions: Spot Detection and Refinement.\nMin spots per frame :20 denotes that KiDv1.0.1 will aim to use a :Histogram threshold such that a minimum of :20 spots are detected in the image stack.\nNote: Healthy human cells in mitosis have 92 kinetochores. Therefore, :20 Min spots per frame is a low threshold. However, we have found that using a more accurate range does not significantly improve the detection. Therefore, a more permissive range is left such that if treatments affect the cell kinetochore number, the detection can be comparable to the controls. If the user utilizes a treatment or model organism where less than 20 kinetochores are expected, the user is recommended to adjust the default setting appropriately. For example: Budding yeast have 16 kinetochores in mitosis and thus 20 is not a reasonable number for that system. In this case a min of :0 spots will be more befitting.",
    "Note: Similar as for the Min spots per frame, the Max spots per frame threshold are not restrictive for normal human cells. However, if the user utilizes a treatment (or cell type/organism) where more than 150 kinetochores are expected, the user is recommended to adjust the default value. For example: Drugs can be used to create tetraploid human cells. Tetraploid cells will have 184 kinetochores. Therefore, in such case the user can set a Max spots per frame threshold of :200 such that it is appropriate for this condition.\nMax MMF time per frame (min) :300 denotes that the MMF algorithm in KiDv1.0.1 will try to refine the spots for a maximum of 300 min.\nWeight for intensity restriction – signal weight is applied as the signal in the 488 nm channel is typically the strongest, followed by the 561 nm channel, and the 647 nm channel which is the weakest.\nOptions: Neighbor spot detection\nMask shape – KiDv1.0.1 starts from the kinetochore center location in the CS channel and searches in :Circle (only mask available for ACS processing) to find the spots in the :Neighbor system channel.\nMask radius (μm) – defines the radius of the mask in which KiDv1.0.1 will search for the neighbor spot.\nNote: The default mask radius is :0.3 μm (300 nm). This default reflects the size of the human kinetochore which is approximately 300 nm. With size of 300 nm of the kinetochore as a whole we do not expect the individual components to be more than 300 nm apart. However, if the user is assaying another structure, the mask radius is to be adjusted such that the radius covers the maximum expected distance between the coordinate system channel component and the component in the Neighbor system channel.",
    "Channel number: type the order of channels from inner toward the outer kinetochore components based on the most likely linear arrangement of the kinetochore markers used in the experiment. If only two channels are detected, one box will remain grayed out.\nNote: For ACS correction, the same marker is stained in three colors so the order can be left as default.\nIntensity measurements. The user can choose to make intensity measurements in any of the channels by clicking on the box next to the channel number.\nNote: Intensity measurements are not typically useful for the ACS Correction.\nMask shape – KiDv1.0.1 starts from the kinetochore center location in the CS channel and measures the intensity in a :Circle (only mask available for ACS processing) in the specified channels for intensity measurements.\nMask radius (μm) – defines the radius of the mask in which KiDv1.0.1 will measure intensity.\nNote: The default mask radius is :0.3 μm (300 nm). This default reflects the size of the human kinetochore which is approximately 300 nm. With size of 300 nm of the kinetochore as a whole we do not expect the individual components to be more than 300 nm apart, or larger than 300 nm.

The respective jobset can be named: jS_exp1_13042020_Nnf1CenpCNdc80N_DMSO and will identify Nnf1, CenpC and Ndc80(N) in the 488nm, 561nm and 647nm fluorescent channels, respectively.\nMovie and ROI selection\nClick on Select directory.

    "Coordinate system channel. Choose a coordinate system (CS) channel based on the following criteria: (1) the protein is a robust kinetochore marker, i.e., does not get loaded/unloaded dynamically, (2) has a clear kinetochore-localized signal, (3) if relevant, can serve as a reference in multiple experiments. For example: for Nnf1-A488, CenpC-A561, Ndc80(N)-A647, the best marker to use as CS channel is Channel2 (CenpC-A561) as the antibody is raised in guinea pig (uncommon host) and can serve as reference for multiple experiments.\nSet the detection in the non-coordinate system (NCS) channels to :Neighbor and the refinement to :MMF (see steps 3c iii. and iv. for description of these options). NCS channels are all acquired channels with a kinetochore marker except the channel selected as CS channel in step iii.\nLeave the detection to :None and the refinement to :None in channels with no staining or no kinetochore marker stained. For example: for Nnf1-A488, CenpC-A561, Tubulin-A647: CenpC produces robust kinetochore staining and is a a good reference marker as the antibody is raised in uncommon host (Guinea Pig). Therefore, Channel2 is set as the CS channel. Nnf1 is a kinetochore marker and Channel2 is the CS channel, therefore, Channel1 is set as NCS channel. Tubulin is not a kinetochore marker and, therefore, no detection is set in Channel3.\nOptions: Spot detection and refinement – do not change these options for human cells unless there is an issue. See 3d for explanation of the options.\nOptions: Chromatic shift\nCheck the box next to Provide chromatic shift correction. Next, the user loads the ACS jobset created in step 3.\nTo run detection in two channels, click on the field under Jobset positioned on the right of the used channel pair (i.e., channel vector 1-2).",
    "To run detection in three channels, load the ACS jobset into all jobset fields (1-2; 1-3; 2-3). For example: for Nnf1-A488, CenpC-A561, Ndc80(N)-A647, spot detection is set for all channels and the ACS jobset is loaded into all jobset fields.\nNote: ACS dataset is required for each day of sample imaging.\nCheck the box for Filter chromatic shift spots.\nMin spot intensity (% of max) – enter :25 to consider only chromatic shift spots that have intensity which is 25% or higher of the maximum image intensity for chromatic shift correction. Using this value means that very weak intensity spots will be discarded.\nMin spot separation – enter :0.75 to discard ACS spots that are closer than 0.75 μm. This parameter filters background and overlapping spots based on the fact that the kinetochore sister-sister pair distance at rest (no force applied) is 0.75 μm.\nOptions: Neighbor spot detection\nMask shape – KiDv1.0.1 starts from the kinetochore center location in the CS channel and searches in a :Semi-Circle or :Circle area to find the spots in the Neighbor system channels. The :Semi-Circle is used when :Metaphase plate option is given in step 4c ii to orientate the search area relative to the metaphase plate. :Circle is used in all other situations.\nMask radius (μm) – defines the radius of the mask in which KiDv1.0.1 will search for the neighbor spot.\nNote: The default mask radius is :0.3 μm (300 nm), see 3 e ii for more information.",

The user can choose to make intensity measurements in any of the channels by clicking on the box next to the channel number.\nNote: Check all the boxes if in the future intensity measurement may become useful as these are quick to run and if afterwards such analysis is required, the full jobset will need to be re-analyzed.\nMask shape – KiDv1.0.1 starts from the kinetochore center location in the CS channel and measures the intensity in a :Circle or in a :Semi-Circle in the specified channels for intensity measurements.

The goal is to select the ‘‘good’’ cells for the analysis, pair the detected sister kinetochores and select the good quality spots in the CS channel. ‘‘Good’’ cells are considered those that efficiently respond to a treatment (e.g., cells with no microtubule stubs upon nocodazole treatment) and cells that satisfy a criterium of selection based on the goal of the experiment (e.g., cells with all kinetochores aligned in a metaphase plate when the goal is to study the kinetochore architecture in metaphase).\"\nCritical: If the user has closed MATLAB and re-opened it after step 4, the user should load the jobset analysis from step 4 as described in step 4 e iii.\nNote: The kinetochore sister pairing is automatically saved in the jobset during the analysis.\nNote: The user can stop the pairing at any point by simultaneously pressing on the keyboard Command and C.

BEDCA is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and the Bayesian framework in BEDCA gives tighter confidence intervals than previous methods (Churchman et al., 2005, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Suzuki et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; ; see Figure1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], for testing of BEDCA see Roscioli et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])",
    "Critical: In order to produce reliable results, the kinetochore and cell sample sizes need to be sufficiently large, the latter to ensure biological variability is taken into account. We recommend cell sample sizes greater than 5 (ideally as quantified by the diversity measures to allow for unequal kinetochore counts). The kinetochore sample size should be a few hundred based on our experience (with our experimental system); provided the posteriors are approximately Gaussian the required sample size N can be estimated from an initial run with N1 samples, length variance vare, and desired length variance vard as N=N1 x vard/vare. Sample sizes need to be increased for (true) distances in the range of 0–30 nm, for instance a sample size of 500 kinetochores may be required in this range. In this range, posterior length distributions may have a thick tail towards 0; the posterior standard deviation is then not a good estimate of the confidence interval and the above calculation likely underestimates the required sample size. To make sure the correction parameters and sample size are appropriate, the user should always check the quality of the correction by following the advice in step 14.\nInput the 3D delta information from step 10. into the BEDCA algorithm\nInput the iM file in the BEDCA directory: Load the iM structures saved in step 10 into MATLAB by dragging them in the Workspace window.",

Then save the structure selection in one file by clicking with right mouse button on the selection and choosing Save as. Choose as destination MATLAB/BEDCA/ExptData and as name choose the name of the individual iM structures without Treatment annotation (the structures saved together should be of the same distance, same experiment but different treatment only, see example below). For example: the Ndc80N-CenpC distance is measured in cells treated with DMSO and with nocodazole, creating the iM structures: iM_exp1_Nnf1CenpCNdc80N_DMSO_CenpCNdc80N and iM_exp1_Nnf1CenpCNdc80N_noc_CenpCNdc80N. As all other parameters are the same except for treatment, the two structures can be saved in a single file, named iM_exp1_Nnf1CenpCNdc80N_CenpCNdc80N. Then the single file is input into BEDCA as described above, and each treatment is accessed in BEDCA using the ‘‘treatment’’ input in the Run_BEDCA function.\nAnalysis of experiment with only one treatment.

The number of steps the BEDCA algorithm will take in the run to infer the Delta distance is set by value following 'nsteps' (see 13 a V.). In the first instance a value of 100000 is suggested, i.e., 100,000 steps. The last two entries set options for BEDCA, so Run_BEDCA(n, 'treatment', [], [], []) runs BEDCA with default values. See the following for more information on the parameters and filters used.\nParameters used by BEDCA",
    "Priors. The BEDCA algorithm uses priors (prior knowledge) for the spot spread in the x/y, and z directions, specifically for the precisions (inverse variances) taux (the noise is assumed to be the same in x and y) and tauz. Priors are needed as there is typically insufficient information in the data to use uninformed priors. Prior experimental knowledge, for instance, can be gleaned from Roscioli et al, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]. The prior means for the standard deviations of the spot Gaussian in x (sdx, σx) and in z(sdz, σz) are set to 20 nm and 40 nm, respectively, for antibody-stained samples. As antibody staining in general results in better signal-to-noise ratio as compared to fluorescent protein labels, the sdx and sdz prior means are set to 25 nm and 75 nm, respectively, when one or both of the proteins are tagged with fluorescent protein. These prior means can be set by the user under the options structure, see help Run_BEDCA.\nAlpha (a). The a parameter controls the prior variance; the relative error (of the prior) is 1/  √ a  . A relative error of 30% (a=3) seems to work on the majority of the data, whilst 100% (a=1) is advised if possible. The a value by default is set to 4 and allows for 50% relative error in the taux and tauz prior. The user is recommended to use a low a value if possible, although to retain comparability across experiments using the same a is recommended.\nThe effect of your priors (means of taux, tauz, and a) should be checked post run. The parameter posterior distribution should lie well within the prior distribution, i.e., the data has improved on the estimates (from prior knowledge) whilst being consistent with that prior knowledge. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1176-Fig6.jpg",

The mean and sd. of the posterior tauz distribution are stated above (mean 0.00036346 nm-2, sd. 0.000023406 nm-2).\nChains. By default, BEDCA uses four independent runs (chains), i.e., running on the same data input. This allows convergence of the algorithm to be assessed. Sampling algorithms need to converge to the desired distribution. In absence of convergence the results are UNRELIABLE. Convergence is thus essential for accurate distance correction.\nNumber of steps. The number of steps is the number of iterations BEDCA uses of the underlying Markov chain. In case of a lack of convergence, the number of steps should be increased and the algorithm re-run. It is advised to increase by multiples of 2 or 5. Convergence is slower for smaller data sets and smaller distances.\nFilters",
    "Z filter. The z filter is optional and removes any distances that exceed 100 nanometers projected distance in the z-plane. This filtered data is only used for comparison plots such that the user can check for effects on the distribution from kinetochores lying in the z-plane where the resolution is poorer as compared to the x/y plane.\n3D distance filter. Any uncorrected 3D Delta distances above 200 nm are filtered out by default. Delta distances rarely go beyond 200 nm given the size of the kinetochore (although corona proteins may be this distance from the CCAN), and thus such measurements are outliers in the data. The 3D Delta filter by default removes KT measurements above this threshold (see step 14 b.). The user can increase the distance filter to an appropriate value by replacing 200 with a desired distance in nanometers.\nBEDCA output troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nQuality control: BEDCA Warning messages. BEDCA can alert the user of a problem by displaying in the Command window the following warnings:\ntaux too strong or inappropriate and tauz too strong or inappropriate. The data isn’t consistent with your prior choices (either taux, tauz means or a). Check that the a parameter is set to 4 as default, and if a=4, try a smaller a, such as a=1. Check your prior estimates of spot center accuracy (mean taux, tauz). Alternatively, the user should check if the staining is annotated correctly, i.e., the input of ‘Ab’ or ‘GFP’ stain in the ExptData_list file. If neither of these resolves the warning, the user should go back to step 2 and optimize the imaging conditions such that the signal-to-noise ratio is improved.",
    "Fewer than 300 KT. Algorithm performance poor especially for distances < 50nm and Effective number of cells is <5. Biological variation will not be averaged out, so estimates are unreliable. In that case, the user should perform another biological replicate, analyze it (KiDv1.0.1) and pool the data as described in step 9 above before running the BEDCA correction.\nQuality control: Evaluation of the BEDCA run.\nCritical: The user should always evaluate the run to make sure the obtained results are informative.\nEvaluate the posterior Distribution. See Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A. The distributions of the inflated (input) and corrected Delta (output) are automatically plotted and the figure is saved in MATLAB/MCMCrunsyAnalysisNameyFigures under the name ‘‘DataWithPostEsts’’. Here, AnalysisName refers to the name under which the analysis is saved (see step 12 b. v.). First, check that part of the distance distribution has not been cut off by the filtering of Delta 3D distances over 200nm (i.e., does not lie in the obvious tail of the distribution and is only removing what look like outliers). If the distribution has been cut off by the filter, change the filter as appropriate (see step 13 b. ii.) and rerun the algorithm again (see step 13). Second, check that the (uncorrected) distance distribution does not display more than one obvious peak. That would suggest a mixture of two distances which is inappropriate for BEDCA (we have not yet observed such case).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1176-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Tauz has order of magnitude 10-4 nm-2.",
    "Evaluate the convergence. See Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B. Figure with the convergence characteristics is automatically saved in MATLAB\\MCMCruns\\name\\Figures under the name ‘‘ConvPosteriorSummary’’. Here, name refers to the name under which the analysis is saved (see step 12 b. v.). The Figure displays three plots: the convergence of the mean (mu), of taux (taux) and tauz (tauz) (for more information on priors and convergence see steps 13 a). First, check the convergence value is displayed at the top of each plot. If the convergence value (GRc) for all parameters is below 1.02, convergence has been successful and the user can proceed to step (3).Otherwise, the algorithm has not converged and the results are UNRELIABLE. If not converged, set the Number of steps (see step 13 a. v.) to a higher value, i.e., if the user has ran BEDCA with ‘nsteps’, 100000, the user could attempt 300000. The maximum number of iterations that we have used for problematic datasets is 1,000,000. If that does not lead to convergence, increase the sample size if it is below 1000 kinetochores as too small kinetochore and cell sample size can also lead to lack of convergence. Next, check if the estimated taux is smaller than tauz. Taux and tauz quantify the detection accuracy in the x/y and z axes, respectively. The resolution in x/y is in principle better than the one in z. Thus, the error in the x/y direction (taux) should be smaller than the error in the z-direction (tauz). In Roscioli et al., we observed orders of taux to be 10-3 nm2 and for tauz 10-4 nm-2. Finally, check the shape of the mean, taux and tauz distributions. The distributions should not display multiple peaks or have a shape strongly deviating from Gaussian.",
    "Note: If the true Euclidian distance is very close to 0, the Gaussian distribution of the mean Euclidian distance (mu) will be centered close to 0 value and thus the user will see only the positive values of the distribution, i.e. the distribution should resemble Gaussian distribution cut-off at 0 on the left side. Such appearance is normal and the user should not classify this scenario as abnormal distribution shape. However, (true) small distances (of the order of the spot centre errors) can have thick tails running towards zero.

By default, KiDv1.0.1 will display scale bar of 3 μm at the bottom right of the image, without length label. To change the length of the scale bar use option ‘scaleBarSize’, x, where x is the desired length in μm. To display label of the scale bar length, use option ‘scaleBarLabel’, 1.\nLabeling on the image. To display text overlaid with the image use option ‘textNorthWest’, ‘textNorthEast’ or ‘textSouthEast’ to display the text in the upper left corner, upper right corner or bottom right corner, respectively. Input the text in the form {‘label’}, where label is the text, or to separate the text in multiple line use {‘label1’, ‘label2’, label3’} where each label will appear on separate line. For example: ‘textNorthEast’, {‘Nnf1-A488’, ‘CenpC-A561’, ‘Ndc80(N)-A647’} will display in the upper right corner Nnf1-A488, CenpC-A561 and Ndc80(N)-A647, each on a new line.\nTranspose the image. To transpose the image, i.e., flip the image on its main diagonal axis, use option ‘transpose’, 1\nBibliography.\nAbbreviations in text:\nACS – approximate chromatic shift\nCS channel – coordinate system channel.\nNCS – non-coordinate system channel.\nVariable functional name abbreviations\njS – jobset, created in steps 3 and 4.\nmS – movie structure, created in step 6 or 9.\nsS_sel – spot selection before the metadata is updated to adhere to raw movie numbers, created in steps 6, 7, and 8\nsS – spot selection after the metadata is updated to adhere to raw movie numbers, created in steps 6, 7, and 8\niM – intra-measurements, file that contains intra-kinetochore Delta measurements, created in step 10.",
