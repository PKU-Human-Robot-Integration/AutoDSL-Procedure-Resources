    "Growth of cyanobacteriaAnabaena sp. PCC7120 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 were grown in liquid BG-11 media in glass conical flasks at 30 °C under constant white fluorescent light at approximately 40 μE/m2/s in thermostatic chamber. The cultures were shaken at 105 rpm. In the case of Aphanothece halophytica, BG-11 medium plus Turk Island salt solution (0.5 M NaCl) was used instead of BG-11 medium. The growth of cyanobacterial cells was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 730 nm with a spectrophotometer.Notes: Other conditions such as abiotic stress condition (nitrogen starvation, high salinity, etc.) were applicable (Kageyama et al., 2015).Culture volume should be less than 200 ml in 500 ml size flask. Harvesting cellsCyanobacterial cells grown exponentially were precipitated by centrifugation at 4,300 x g for 15 min at 4 °C from 50 ml cultures (OD730=~0.6). After discarding media by decantation, the cells were suspended in the remaining media (~1 ml). Cell suspensions were transferred to preweighed 1.5 ml sampling tubes.Cells were precipitated by centrifugation at 22,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, then media were removed completely.Cells were stored at -80 °C before use.Extraction of alkanesFrozen cells were dried up using a vacuum evaporator.Dry cell weight was measured.Note: Usually ~20 mg of dried cells was obtained.Methanol was added to dried cells.Note: We added 1 ml of Methanol/20 mg of dried cells.Cells were disrupted by sonication (output: 7, total on time: 6 min).Notes: Samples were on ice during sonication treatment with 12 burst of 30 sec followed by intervals of 30 sec for cooling.Be careful that the methanol extract does not scatter during sonication treatment. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for overnight.Cell debris was precipitated by centrifugation at 22,000 x g for 10 min at 25 °C, then the supernatants were transferred into new 1.5 ml tubes.",
    "This methanol extract contained alkanes.Note: After preparing the extracts, we subjected extracts to GC-MS analysis immediately.Detection of alkanes by GC-MS500 μl of methanol extracts contain alkanes were transferred into glass vials designed for GC-MS.Samples were subjected to GC-MS. The following is a gas chromatography method for alkanes (pentadecane and heptadecane) using a capillary column RESTEK Rtx-1MS (15 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter):Helium was used as the carrier gas at the flow rate of 1.3 ml min-1.8 μl of samples were injected using a 1:100 split* ratio of helium carrier gas to column at 300 °C of inlet temperature. Initial oven temperature of 100 °C for 3 min.Ramp to 320 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min.*Note: Glass insert designed for split analysis should be used. Quantification of alkanesFor Quantification of pentadecane and heptadecane, we used authentic standards. These authentic standards of alkane were diluted with methanol, and then subjected to GC-MS to make standard curves. Standard curves were made by using the peak area calculated by GCMSsolution software. Retention time of pentadecane and heptadecane using the method described above was ~5.6 and ~7.0 min, respectively (Figure 1A). For identification of pentadecane and heptadecane in cyanobacterial extracts, their retention times of the peaks in chromatogram and fragmentation patterns of product peaks were compared with authentic standards (Figure 1 and Figure 2). As a representative data, chromatogram using Anabaena sp. PCC7120 extract and fragmentation pattern of the peak at 7 min were shown (Figure 2). For quantification of pentadecane and heptadecane in cyanobacteria, area of the target peak obtained by GC-MS was calculated by GCMSsolution software, and then concentration was determined using standard curve of authentic standards. As shown in Figure 1C, standard curve of heptadecane was linear at the range of 0.005 - 0.5 mg/ml.",
    "A similar line was also obtained for pentadecane.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151220/20151220224200_4427.jpgFigure 1.

Fragmentation pattern of the main peak at 7 min was similar to that of heptadecane authentic standard (see Figure 1B)."
