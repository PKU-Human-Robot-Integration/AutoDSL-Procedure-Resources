    "Preparation of the pre-culture (to be used for all subsequent culture conditions)Streak Xoo strain ΔrpfB from -80 °C glycerol stock on NA plate supplemented with cephalexin at a final concentration of 20 µg/ml.Incubate the plate at 28 °C for 4 days to obtain single colonies. With a pipette tip, isolate one ΔrpfB colony and inoculate in 10 ml of NB supplemented with cephalexin with a final concentration of 20 µg/ml in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask.Incubate the ΔrpfB culture in the MaxQTM 6000 Incubated/Refrigerated shaker at 28 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 36 h.Preparation of Xoo cultureMeasure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the 1:4 diluted ΔrpfB pre-culture in a spectrophotometer and calculate the optical density of the pre-culture by multiplying the measured reading by 4 (the dilution ratio).Adjust the OD600 of the pre-culture to approximately 1.0 using NB.Add 1 ml of adjusted ΔrpfB pre-culture to 50 ml nutrient broth (1: 50 dilution) in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask with vent cap.Incubate the culture at 28 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 36-48 h until it reaches early stationary phase (OD600 ≈ 2.8-3.0) for DSF/BDSF extraction.Note: If other bacterial strains are assayed, other specific growth conditions should be optimized.Extracellular DSF/BDSF extractionDispense 4 ml of the ΔrpfB culture in two 2 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 15 min to obtain the culture supernatant for extracellular DSF/BDSF extraction.Transfer the supernatant to two new 2 ml microtubes and adjust its pH to 3.0-3.5 by adding adequate volume (usually 15 to 20 µl) of 6 N hydrochloric acid and monitoring pH changes with test strips.Dispense the supernatant in eight 2 ml microtubes (0.5 ml per tube), and then, add 1 ml of ethyl acetate into each tube.",
    "Vortex the microtubes at the highest speed for 5 min to extract DSF and BDSF molecules and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 10 min to separate the ethyl acetate fraction from the aqueous fraction.Carefully collect the ethyl acetate fractions (upper layer) into four 1.5 ml microtubes by pipetting and evaporate the solvent in a CentriVap benchtop concentrator at 40 °C to complete dryness (approximately 20 min).Dispense 0.15 ml of methanol in the four 1.5 ml microtubes and vortex the microtubes vigorously for 30 sec, which ensures that all residues are re-dissolved.Centrifuge the microtubes at 2,000 x g for 1 min, and then transfer the extraction solution from each microtube into a new 1.5 ml microtube using a pipette.Evaporate the solvent in the CentriVap benchtop concentrator at 40 °C to complete dryness (approximately 40 min). Notes:At this point, the samples may be frozen at -20 °C for later steps or analyzed immediately as described in the following steps.For protection from inhalation of volatile solvents, steps C3 to C8 in this section should be performed in a fume hood.Intracellular DSF/BDSF extractionDecant 40 ml ΔrpfB culture in a 50 ml centrifuge tubes and harvest bacterial cells by centrifuging at 8,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and add 40 ml of 1x PBS buffer in the tube to wash the cell pellets by pipetting gently.Discard the supernatant and harvest the washed bacterial cells by centrifuging at 8,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Re-suspend the cell pellets in 10 ml of ice-cold sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.8).Freeze the re-suspension solution in a -20 °C freezer for 1 h and then incubate the bacterial suspension at room temperature for 30 to 60 min to thaw the suspension completely.Homogenize the cells by pipetting the thawed bacterial suspension gently.",
    "Repeat steps D5 and D6 once more.Sonicate the cell homogenate for a total of 6 min by sonicating for 3 sec, pausing for 4 sec, and repeating this sonication/pause cycle120 times (amplitude set at 20%) on ice using the Vibra cellTM High Intensity Ultrasonic Liquid Processors connected with a Tapered Microtip probe (3 mm diameter). Transfer the centrifuge tube containing the processed cell lysate into a water bath for 5 min at 95 °C to denature the total protein.Separate the soluble lysis solution with bacterial cell debris by centrifuging at 8,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.After centrifugation, immediately transfer the soluble lysis solution (the transparent part) to a 250 ml Erlenmeyer glass flask using a pipette. This should be performed carefully to avoid disturbing the precipitate at the bottom of the tube.Add 20 ml of ethyl acetate in the flask and close the flask with the cap immediately to avoid evaporation and spillage of the volatile solvent. Incubate the capped flask in the MaxQTM 6000 shaker at 28 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for 10 min to extract DSF and BDSF.Transfer the extraction mixture to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 10 min to separate the ethyl acetate fraction from the aqueous fraction.Transfer the ethyl acetate fractions (upper layer) to a 100 ml pear shaped glass flask by pipetting carefully.Remove the solvent by rotary evaporation at 40 °C to complete dryness (approximately 5 min).Dispense 1 ml of methanol into the pear shaped glass flask to re-dissolve the residue by pipetting several times.Transfer the solution to a 1.5 ml microtube and evaporate the solvent in the CentriVap benchtop concentrator at 40 °C to complete dryness.",
    "Notes: At this point, the samples may be frozen at -20 °C for later steps or be analyzed immediately as described in the following steps.For protection from inhalation of volatile solvents, steps D12 to D17 in this section should be performed in a fume hood.LC/MS sample preparationCrude extraction samples can be obtained by adding 200 µl of methanol into the 1.5 ml microtube and vortex at the highest speed.To remove any insoluble particles in the sample, filter the crude sample through a MS syringe filter (0.2 µm) connected with an 1 ml disposable syringe. Collect the filtered sample (approximately 100 µl) in a new 1.5 ml microtube.Transfer 60 µl of filtered sample into a chromatography vial fitted with a flat bottom insert using a pipette. Cap the vials. Samples are now ready for LC/MS analysis.LC/MS procedureUse HPLC grade methanol (eluent B)-water (eluent A) (80:20, v/v) as mobile phase.Maintain the column temperature at 30 °C and flow rate at 0.4 ml/min.Equilibrate the column for 15 min or longer until the baseline is stable.Inject 5 μl aliquots of prepared samples onto an Agilent 1290 Infinity UPLC with a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column.Detect DSF and BDSF molecules using a diode array detector (Agilent G4212A) set to a detection wavelength of 220 nm with a band width of 4 nm.The sample is then injected into an AJS ESI ion-trap mass spectrometer in negative ionization mode.MS source parameters are as follows:Gas temperature: 325 °CDrying gas: 8 L min-1Nebulizer: 35 psigSheath gas temperature: 350 °CSheath gas flow: 11 L min-1Capillary voltage (Vcap): 3,500 VNozzle voltage: 200 VThe mass range: m/z 100-1,700"
