    "1. Design of Targeting Construct(s), Probes for Southern Blot, and Primers for PCR\nSelect the first coding exon (exon 2) of the Myh9 gene for disruption or insertion in the application of knockout/knock-in reported here.\nRetrieve the 5-kb upstream and 5-kb downstream DNA sequences surrounding the Myh9 exon 2 from the genome.ucsc.edu website.\nAnalyze restriction digestion patterns of enzymes (REs) with 1–2 cuts in this 10-kb region by using pDRAW software to determine suitable RE(s) to digest the genomic DNA for Southern blotting.\n\tNOTE: Dra I meets this requirement and is selected for the purpose.\nSelect a 4 kb fragment immediate upstream of the Myh9 exon 2 as the left homology arm (LHA) and a 1.7 kb fragment immediate downstream sequence as the right homology arm (RHA); choose a 1 kb fragment 5' upstream of the LHA as the left probe (LP) for Southern blotting and a 1.2 kb fragment 3' downstream of the RHA as the right probe (RP), based on the above analysis.\nUse a primer3 program to design the forward and reverse primers for amplifying those four DNA fragments by PCR. Design a pair of primers with the forward primer resided near the 3' terminal of a selection marker neomyocin resistance gene (P1) and the reverse primer located just outside the RHA (P2).\n\tNOTE: This primer pair will be used for identifying targeted ES clones by PCR29.\nFind a 129Sv BAC clone covering mouse Myh9 gene locus by visiting the bacpac.chori.org website (note: isogenic DNA is preferred). Isolate BAC DNA using a kit suitable for purifying large pieces of DNA following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n\tNOTE: Purified BAC DNA will be used as the template for PCR amplification.\nDraw a schematic representation of the targeting constructs, probes, and primers to summarize this information.",

Plate the electroporated ES cells onto dishes with neo-resistant MEF feeders.\nAfter 24 h, switch to ES cell medium with 400 µg/mL G418 and 200 µM ganciclovir and continue to culture for 4–5 days with a daily medium change. Pick up drug-resistant ES clones into 48-well plates.\n\tNOTE: Normally, four 48-well plates are used per construct.\nDuplicate the 48-well plates.",
    "NOTE: One set of the plates is cryopreserved, and the other set is used for genomic DNA preparation.\n4. Preparation of Genomic DNAs and the Digestion with Restriction Enzyme(s)\nPrepare gDNAs from ES cells using a commercial kit (genomic DNA purification kit) with minor modifications.\n\t\nRemove media from the ES cell culture and add 500 µL of nuclei lysis solution, including RNaseA, directly to the wells to lyse the cells.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell lysate can be stored at -80 °C or treated immediately.\nPipet up and down several times to lyse the cells fully and transfer them to a clean 1.5-mL tube.\nAdd one-third of the volume of the protein precipitation solution to the 1.5 mL tube, vortex vigorously for 20 s, chill the samples on ice for 5 min, and then, centrifuge at a force of 2,000 x g for 5 min. Transfer the supernatant to another clean 1.5 mL tube containing an equal volume of isopropanol; gently mix the solution. (Note that white thread-like strands can be seen at this moment.) Centrifuge at a force of 2,000 x g for 1 min; then, discard the supernatant.\nWash the gDNA pellet with 1 mL of 70% ethanol at room temperature, centrifuge at a force of 2,000 x g for 1 min, aspirate the supernatant carefully, and then, air-dry the gDNA pellet for 3 min.\nDissolve the gDNAs with 100 µL of DNA rehydration solution and, then, incubate at 65 °C for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight.\nStore the gDNAs at 2–8 °C.\nDigest the gDNAs with predesigned RE Dra I. Set up a 30-µL digestion reaction by mixing 3 µL of 10x buffer for Dra I, 3 µL of Dra I, 10 µg of gDNAs/sample, and H2O up to 30 µL, and incubate at 37 °C overnight.",
    "Check the completeness of the digestion by DNA gel, analyzing 5 µL of the digested reaction, and then, add the 3 µL of 10x DNA-loading buffer for the subsequent step.\n5. Southern Blotting and PCR Identification\nSouthern blotting screening\n\t\nSeparate the digested gDNAs by electrophoresis and transfer to a membrane.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 1% agarose electrophoresis gel with ethidium bromide (EB), load the samples from step 4.3 and a 1 kb ladder, and run the gel with a low voltage (30–40 V) overnight.\nTake out the gel and take a picture with a DNA gel-imaging system after electrophoresis. Check whether the digested and separated gDNAs display a smear-like image.\nSoak the gel in a tray with 0.2 N HCl solution and shake it gently for 20 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the gel to DNA-denaturing solution and shake it gently for 20 min at room temperature.\nSwitch the gel into DNA-neutralizing solution and shake it gently for 20 min at room temperature.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The gel is prone to breakage after this step, so it must be handled carefully.\nUse the rapid downward transfer system to transfer the DNAs from the gel to the membrane. Assemble the TurboBlotter and blotting stack according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n\t\t\tNOTE: 10x or 20x saline-sodium citrate (SSC) solution is used as a transfer buffer. In general, 3 h of transfer is enough to transfer 95% of gDNAs from gel to membrane; however, a longer time of transfer is innocuous.\nTake out the membrane and wash it with 2x SSC for 1 min, absorb the liquid with tissues, and then cross-link the DNA with the membrane using a UV crosslinker.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The membrane can be stored at 4 °C for one week.\nLabel the DNA probes with radioactivity.",

Add the mixed prehybridization solution to the hybridization tube. Place it into the hybridization oven (set rolling and the temperature at 42 °C) and let the prehybridization proceed for 30 min.\nHybridize the membrane with the labeled probe(s).",
    "Take out the hybridization tube and pour the prehybridization solution into a 50 mL tube; add the denatured probe (heated at 100 °C for 3 min) from step 5.1.2.7 to this tube and mix gently.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Reduce any inducing bubbles.\nReturn the mixed solution to the hybridization tube and perform the hybridization at 42 °C overnight.\nWash the membrane(s) to remove nonhybridized probes.\n\t\t\nPlace the membrane(s) into a tray with 1x SSC + 0.1% SDS and shake gently at 55–60 °C for 10 min.\nTransfer the membrane(s) to a tray with 0.5x SSC + 0.1% SDS and shake gently at 55–60 °C for 10 min.\nCheck the radioactivity on the membrane(s) by using a portable Geiger counter to decide whether a third washing is required.\nExpose the radioactivity on the membrane to X-ray films.\n\t\t\nRemove the liquid from the washed membrane(s).\nEnfold the membrane(s) with plastic wrap and fix it/them in the exposure cassette.\nExpose the membrane to two sheets of X-ray film in a dark room.\nPlace the exposure cassette at -80 °C overnight or longer.\nDevelop the films to visualize the results. Evaluate whether a corresponding ES clone is the desired one with the targeted recombination or not, according to the sizes of the DNA bands detected by the probes.\nRehybridize the same membrane by another probe after stripping off the used probe according to the following procedure: take out the used membrane, wash it 1x with clean H2O, and then, incubate it in striping solution (55% formamide, 2% SSPE, 1% SDS, H2O) at 65 °C with gentle shaking for 1–2 h.\nPCR identification",
