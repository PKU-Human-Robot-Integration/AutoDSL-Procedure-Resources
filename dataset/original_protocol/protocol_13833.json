    "This protocol was approved by the IRB of the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia (212250-3210-21002-06-15). Participation was voluntary, and all the enrolled women signed the informed consent form.\n1. Visceral adipose tissue collection\nObtain VAT biopsies through partial omentectomy during cesarean section from healthy adult women with singleton pregnancies at term without labor.\nAfter the uterine closure and hemostasis, proceed to identify greater omentum and extend it on a wet compress. The AT exposed is VAT.\nLocate the largest blood vessel and trace an imaginary line of 7 x 5 cm to the greater omentum base.\nIdentify an avascular zone and use Kelly forceps to drill the outer side of VAT.\nUse Ochsner forceps to clamp the proximal and distal side in the zone where VAT was drilled and use Metzenbaum scissors to cut the tissue.\nTie greater omentum with black silk number 1.\nRemove Ochsner forceps and evaluate the hemostasis.\nPlace the VAT biopsy into a sterile container and transport it to the lab immediately.\n2. Enzymatic digestion of visceral adipose tissue and isolation of mature adipocytes and stromal vascular fraction cells\nWeigh the VAT biopsy and rinse with 1x PBS pH 7.4.\nCut 4 g of VAT and use scissors to mince the tissue into small pieces in a dissection tray.\nTransfer minced VAT to a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube, add 20 mL of PBS, and shake gently to remove the excess of red blood cells.\nDiscard PBS and repeat the procedure twice.\nTransfer VAT to a new sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube and add 25 mL of digestion solution (0.25% collagenase type II, 5 mM glucose, 1.5% albumin in PBS).\nIncubate at 37 °C for 60 min in an orbital shaker at 125 rpm.",
    "Filter the digested tissue through three layers of gauze into a new sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTwo phases are obtained, an upper phase that corresponds to mature adipocytes, while SFV cells remain in the pellet. Gently transfer the mature adipocytes into a new sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube using a transfer pipette.\nAdd 20 mL of cold PBS, shake gently, and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard PBS and repeat the procedure twice.\nUse a transfer pipette to gently transfer the mature adipocytes into a 1.5 mL DNase-RNase free microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 1 min at 4 °C and remove the excess PBS using a P200 micropipette. Repeat this step if it is necessary.\nGently transfer 300 μL of mature adipocyte suspension into a 1.5 mL DNase-RNase free microcentrifuge tubes. Store mature adipocytes at -80 °C until RNA extraction.\n\tNOTE: Adipocytes do not form a pellet.\nOnce adipocytes are separated (step 2.9), aspirate most of the digestion solution with a transfer pipette, keeping the SVF pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nTransfer the pellet with SVF cells into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube using a transfer pipette.\nWash cell pellet gently, resuspending in 20 mL of cold 1x PBS by pipetting up and down.\nCentrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and rapidly discard the supernatant by decantation.\nPerform a second wash by repeating steps 2.17 and 2.18.\nAdd 5 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer equilibrated to room temperature (RT) to the SVF pellet and suspend by repeated pipetting. Do not vortex.",
    "Incubate for 5 min at RT and centrifuge for 5 min at 800 x g. Carefully remove the supernatant using a transfer pipette and dispose of properly.\nTo neutralize the lysis buffer, add 10 mL of cold 1x PBS and gently mix until the cell pellet disaggregates.\nCentrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min to obtain SVF pellet and discard PBS. A white pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube.\nResuspend cells in 5 mL of 1x PBS at RT by repeated pipetting and filtered through three layers of gauze into a new 50 mL conical tube. Subsequently, these cells will be used for macrophage subpopulation characterization by flow cytometry.\n3. RNA extraction from mature adipocytes\nPrepare a clean area, using RNase decontamination spray to avoid RNA degradation. Use a set of pipettes reserved for RNA procedures. All tubes and tips employed should be RNase-free.\nThaw the mature adipocyte suspension (section 2.14) at 4 °C if it was stored to -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles.\nLyse cells by adding 1,000 μL of acid-guanidinium-phenol based reagent, and mix thoroughly with a P1000 micropipette to homogenize.\nIncubate for 5 min at RT to boost dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes.\nCentrifuge cell lysate for 5 min at 12,000 x g at RT. Three phases will be obtained: an upper phase (yellow) corresponding to adipocyte lipids, a middle phase (pink) corresponding to nucleic acids, and a pellet (cellular debris).\nCarefully remove the lipid layer, using a P200 micropipette.\nTransfer the middle phase into a new 2 mL tube, avoiding lipid remnant and pellet disturbing (approximately 700 μL).\n4. Purification of total RNA, including microRNAs\nNOTE: A column-based total RNA purification method is used to obtain high-quality total RNA.",
    "Add an equal volume of ethanol (95%–100%) to the sample from section 3.7, approximately 700 μL, and mix by hand inverting the tube for 10 s.\nTransfer 700 μL of the mixture into a column inserted in a collection tube, centrifuge and discard the flow-through.\nReload the column and repeat step 4.2.\nTransfer the column into a new collection tube.\nAdd 400 µL of pre-wash buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through and repeat this step.\nAdd 700 µL of wash buffer to the column and centrifuge for 2 min.\nTransfer the column carefully into a nuclease-free tube.\nAdd 50 µL of nuclease-free water directly to the column matrix and elute the RNA by centrifugation. Prepare aliquots of 10 µL using 200 µL microfuge tubes.\nImmediately put aliquots on ice and use one of them to determine RNA concentration and purity.\nPrepare an aliquot of 5 µL of total RNA adjusted to 100 ng/µL to measure RNA integrity and microRNA concentration.\nStore at -80 °C until use.\n5. Determination of mature adipocyte RNA concentration, purity, and integrity; microRNA quantification assay\nNOTE: RNA concentration and purity determinations are performed using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer; RNA integrity and miRNA quantification are performed using an RNA quality control analyzer.\nWash the sample reader with molecular grade water and wipe.\nLoad 2 µL of elution water (blank), change the setting to RNA, and click on the Blank button.\nLoad 2 µL of sample and click on the Measure button.\nAfter the reading is complete, record the A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios as well as the amount of RNA (ng/µL) (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: RNA with OD260/OD280 and OD260/OD230 ratio around 2.0 is considered pure.\nMeasure the RNA integrity number (RIN) using an RNA integrity kit following the manufacturer´s instructions (Figure 1B).",
    "NOTE: A RIN =10 corresponds to intact RNA, whereas a RIN ≤ 3.0 indicates a strongly degraded RNA. For expression microarrays or RT-qPCR, use RNA with RIN ≥ 6.0.\nUse a small RNA kit to determine the concentration and percent of microRNAs, following the manufacturer´s instructions (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: To avoid the overestimation of small and micro RNAs, use RNA samples with RIN ≥ 6.0.\n6. Count and viability of stromal vascular fraction cells\nDilute 10 μL of SVF cell suspension (section 2.24) into 90 μL of 0.4% Trypan Blue Solution (final dilution 1:10) and apply 10 μL to a standard hemocytometer.\nCount the viable cells carefully, excluding the dead cells, in four squares at the corner of the counting chamber.\nDetermine the cell concentration present in the original suspension: Cell concentration = Total cell count/4 x dilution factor (10) x 10,000 = Cells/mL\nTo calculate the cellular yield (cells per gram of tissue) obtained, multiply the cellular concentration by the original total sample volume (in mL) and divide by the weight of tissue digested (in grams).\nEvaluate cell viability as the percentage of the living cells as follows: % Viability = (Number of viable cells / Total number of cells) x 100.\n7. Characterization of macrophage subsets from stromal vascular fraction\nTransfer a total of 1 x 106 SVF cells/mL to a 5 mL round-bottom polypropylene test tube for flow cytometry and pellet cells by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nVortex carefully to loosen the pellet and resuspend the cells in 100 μL of 1x PBS at RT.\nAdd pre-titrated optimal concentration of each fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibody specific for a cell surface antigen; mix gently and incubate for 15 min in the dark at RT.",
    "Add an excess of cold 1x PBS (≈ 1 mL) and centrifuge the SVF at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard supernatants rapidly by decantation. Be careful not to disturb the pellet.\nAdd 500 μL of 1x lysing solution and incubate 15 min at RT, protecting the tubes from direct light.\nRemove the solution after centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, and store at 2–8 °C in the dark until data acquisition.\nVortex the cells thoroughly at low speed to reduce aggregation before acquiring.\nResuspend the SVF pellet in 5 mL of sheath fluid at RT, and subsequently filter through three layers of gauze into a new 5 mL round-bottom polypropylene test tube before analysis by flow cytometry, to reduce clogging the cell sorter lines.\nVortex each tube briefly before analysis.\nAcquire data from the samples of interest. For flow analysis, count a minimum of 10,000 events.\n\tNOTE: If using a cell sorting flow cytometer, separate the macrophages for application in subsequent studies.\n8. Gating strategy\nPlot the height or width against the area for Forward Scatter (FSC) to determine the singlet population (Figure 2A).\nSelect cells plotting the area for Side Scatter (SSC) against FSC, discarding the cellular debris (Figure 2B).\nFrom selected cells, identify the populations expressing CD45 as hematopoietic cells (Figure 2C), and CD45/CD14 double positive cells as macrophages (Figure 2D).\nFrom CD45+/CD14+ macrophages, detect negative and positive HLA-DR cells (Figure 2E).\n\tNOTE: Include the compensation controls for the antibody panel and adjust spectral overlap on a multicolor flow cytometer adequate for the panel. We perform flow cytometry analysis using a cytometer equipped with three lasers (405 nm violet laser, 488 nm blue laser, and 640 nm red laser), and detectors for the indicated fluorochromes.",
