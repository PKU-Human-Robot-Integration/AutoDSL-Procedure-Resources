    "This study was conducted according to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (No. 2019065). The specimens were collected from a MM patient in the Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (China).\n1. Preparation of the BM smears\nPlace the first 0.2 mL of BM solution on a clean disposable glass slide.\nSpread the BM smears to uniform thickness with sharp tails by quickly removing the BM. Then, dry naturally.\nCover the BM films with 1 mL of Wright-Giemsa solution for approximately 10 s at room temperature.\nAdd 1 mL of phosphate buffer to the slides.\n\tNOTE: Take care to prevent the dye solution from drying or ﬂowing off the slides.\nMix the dye solution gently and maintain it for 15 min at room temperature.\nRinse the slides with clean water and dry them in air at room temperature.\nUse forward light microscopy to detect malignant PCs. The PCs should be well dispersed.\n2. FISH pre-processing of the BM smears\nCover the hybridized area with fixative solution for 10 min to discolor and fix the PCs.\n\t\nTo prepare fresh fixative solution, mix methanol with glacial acetic acid in a volume ratio of 3:1.\nRinse the slide with deionized water (dH2O) and dry it in air at room temperature.\nPreheat a jar containing 2x SSC buffer to 56 °C in a water bath. Freshly dilute the buffer to 20x SSC before use.\n\t\nTo prepare 20x SSC, thoroughly mix 176 g of sodium chloride and 88 g of sodium citrate with 800 mL of dH2O. Measure the pH and adjust to pH 5.3 ± 0.2. Then, add dH2O to bring the final volume to 1 L.",
    "Wash the prepared BM smear in the preheated 2x SSC buffer for 10 min, followed by dipping it into deionized water at room temperature.\nDehydrate the smear in an ethanol gradient (70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol, each for 1 min). Air-dry the smear for 10 min.\n3. BM smear FISH and washing\nNOTE: All steps were performed in a dark room to prevent fluorescence quenching.\nAdd the TP53/centromere of chromosome 17 (CEP17) probe mixture to the hybridization area and cover it with a coverslip. Press gently with fine-pointed tweezers to remove air bubbles from underneath.\nSeal all sides of the coverslip with rubber cement to ensure good tightness.\nAfter solidification of the rubber cement, place the slide on an automatic FISH machine. Perform denaturation at 78 °C for 5 min, followed by hybridization at 37 °C overnight.\nPick up the slide from the FISH machine. Use fine-pointed tweezers to remove the rubber cement gently.\nImmerse the slide in 2x SSC at room temperature for approximately 1 or 2 min to wash the coverslip off.\nWash the slide in 68 °C preheated 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 buffer in a water bath for 2 min.\n\t\nPrepare 0.4x SSC/0.3% NP-40 solution by thoroughly mixing 20 mL of 20x SSC (pH 5.3) with 950 mL of dH2O. Then, add 3 mL of NP-40 and mix thoroughly until completely dissolved. Measure the pH and adjust to 7.0-7.5 with NaOH. Then, add dH2O to bring the final volume of the total solution to 1 L.\nWash the slides with 2x SSC in a 37 °C water bath for 1 min. Set upright in the dark to dry thoroughly for 10 min.\nAdd 10 µL of DAPI to the hybridized area and cover with a coverslip.\n4. FISH analysis and imaging",
    "View the hybridized slide using a suitable filter set on a fluorescence microscope.\nUse a monochromatic blue fluorophore optical filter to observe the fluorescence intensity of the cell nucleus. Take cell nucleus images under a DAPI filter set.\nUse a chromosome centromere probe to show how many chromosomes a cell contains. Label CEP17 with green fluorescence. Use a spectrum green fluorophore optical filter to observe the location of CEP17. Take a CEP17 signals image under the green filter set.\nLabel the TP53 gene with orange fluorescence. Use a spectrum orange fluorophore optical filter to observe TP53. Take a TP53 signals image under this set.\nMerge these three images and examine them for numerical abnormalities.\n\tNOTE: In a normal interphase cell, two orange and two green signals are observed inside a nucleus with blue fluorescence, indicating one pair of normal chromosome 17 (Figure 1).\nSubscription Required.
