  "procedures": [
    "Note: Mice (C57BL/6J, male) aged 10 – 12 weeks were used in this study. All the procedures were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). \n1. Pre-Surgery\nThe day before surgery autoclave and sterilize all the surgical instruments. Wrap the instruments and autoclave at 121 oC at 15 psi for 30 min followed by 30 min of drying (121 oC, 15 psi, 30/30 cycle). Place the instruments in a clean and sterile environment until further use.\nPrepare fresh Rose Bengal (RB) solution (20 mg/ml in sterile saline) every time before the surgery. To completely dissolve RB, vortex the tube then followed by sonication for 5 min at 50/60 Hz with output power of 19 W. Wrap the tube in aluminum foil and protect it from light until further used during surgery.\nPrepare a mixture of ketamine/xylazine in sterile saline. Add 125 µl of xylazine (stock concentration: 20 mg/ml) and 325 µl of ketmaine (stock concentration: 100 mg/ml) and 550 µl of sterile saline to make a final volume of 1 ml of anesthetic mixture.\nPre-warm the homeothermic heating pad.\nPre-warm the metal halide lamp (light source for FN1 epi-fluorescence microscope) for 30 min to stabilize the lamp power.\nAdjust the size of the illuminated region to a diameter of 1 mm using 10X objective and a reticle by adjusting the field diaphragm in the upright FN1 epi-fluorescence microscope.\n2. Surgical Procedure",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with a dose of ketamine (130 mg/kg B. wt.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg B. wt.). Based on the cocktail in 1.3,  4 µl per g of mouse B. wt. are needed. Sterilize the site of injection with an alcohol swab and administer the anesthetics through the intra-peritoneal (IP) route. Take care not to inject the anesthetics into the blood vessels or muscle as this would delay the induction and recovery of the animal.\nApply artificial tear ointment to both eyes of the mouse to prevent drying and place the animal on the heating pad to prevent hypothermia.\nPreparation of animal\n\t\nCheck the animal for proper surgical level anesthesia by using the toe pinch response.\nOnce the animal has reached surgical level of anesthesia, clip the hair on the dorsal surface around midline of the animal using an electric hair trimmer. Scrub the surgical site with 70% ethanol followed by betadine solution three times. Cover the site with a sterile surgical drape until next step.\nSurgical procedure to thin the bone to expose the spinal cord\n\t\nPlace the mouse in a prone position over the homeothermic heating pad on the surgical platform (Figure 1A). Properly secure the mouse posture using a snout clamp to maintain an elongated neck region (Figure 1A, B).\nMake an incision (approximately 1 cm long) using surgical scissors along the dorsal mid line extending from the thoracic vertebrae T9 to T12. Move aside the skin to expose surgical area.\nUsing a scalpel, carefully clear the muscle to expose the dorsal spines at T9 - T12 vertebrae. Stop bleeding in each step by applying gentle pressure with sterile cotton swab. Separate T10 - T12 vertebrae from the surrounding muscle and secure them using a vertebral clamp to stabilize and prevent any movement (Figure 1A, B).",
    "Using a high speed drill with bone polishing drill bit, carefully and gently thin the dorsal surface of T10 or T11 vertebra to visualize the posterior spinal vein and other small vessels on the dorsal surface of the SC (Figure 1C).\nTo prevent thermal damage due to heat generated during the thinning procedure, apply a gentle and constant stream of normal saline along with constant suction to remove the debris.\nUsing a scalpel carefully smooth the bone surface until the main vessel is clearly visible. Take care not to damage the spinal cord during this process.\nOnce the blood vessel is visualized, administer RB at a dose of 30 mg/kg (body weight) through retro-orbital sinus route using an insulin syringe.\nMeasure blood flow using a Laser Doppler flowmeter after 3 min following RB injection if necessary (Figure 2A, B). Maintain asepsis during entire procedure.\n3. Induction of PT\nPlace the animal on an X-Y position adjustable stage over a Lab-Jack which can adjust the height. Adjust the position of the mouse so the exposed region of T11 spinal cord is directly under the 10x objective of the FN1 epi-fluorescence microscope (Figure 3A).\nSet the power of the light source at 12% and irradiate the T11 region with a diameter of 0.75 mm in the middle of thinned spinal cord (Note: this region includes the posterior spinal vein and other capillaries) with a green light (wavelength 540 - 580 nm, which is achieved by the filter cube in the microscope) through the 10X objective for 2 min. Take images at the beginning and end of irradiation (Figure 3B, C) and record the time of the experiment at this point.",
    "Measure blood flow again for 10 min if necessary by placing the laser Doppler probe to the same position above the spinal cord as in 2.4.8 (Figure 2A, B).\nAfter irradiation check for any hemorrhage and if none found proceed to suturing the animal. Suture the superficial fascia along with the muscles on the either side of spinal cord using an absorbable suture or 4-0 size silk suture. Take care not to damage the exposed SC. Suture the skin with 4-0 silk suture. Apply Betadine or iodine to the edges of the skin after suturing.\n4. Post-surgery Care\nAfter suturing, place the animal on the heating pad for recovery. After recovery check the animals for signs of neurological deficits by observing the movement of both hind-limbs. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nTransfer the animals to the home cage. Do not return the animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nCheck the animals at regular intervals. In case of severe neurological deficits, provide proper care like evacuation of bladder, administration of analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg). Check for dehydration and administer normal saline subcutaneously in severe case. Usually, buprenorphine ( 0.1 mg/kg) will be administered after suturing to relieve pain in the surgical site.\nIf animals are not immediately euthanized after surgery, we will put high water content diet on the cage floor, so the animals can reach the food easily.\n5. Transcardial Perfusion, Nissl staining and Immunostaining\nTranscardially perfuse the animal as described previously17-20.\n\t\nAnesthetize the animal as described earlier in the protocol and transcardially perfuse with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4), followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.",
    "After perfusion, remove the spinal cord (SC) and post-fix it in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C O/N. Transfer the fixed SC into PBS with 30% sucrose and keep it for 2 - 3 days until it sinks to the bottom of the tube.\nUsing a cryostat cut the spinal cord into 30 µm thick sections and place them serially on a gelatin-coated glass slides or in a 48-well plate with 0.01 M PBS.\nNissl staining: To inspect the injury caused by PT perform a Nissl staining on spinal cord sections as previously described17-20.\n\t\nBriefly, collect every fifth spinal cord slice on the glass slides and stain with 0.25% cresyl violet. Take images of the stained sections (Figure 4).\nImmunostaining: As described previously using a floating section method17,18,20.\n\t\nBriefly, stain the spinal cord sections by incubating O/N at 4 °C with rabbit anti-glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) polyclonal antibody (1:300), rabbit anti-NeuN antibody (1:300), and rabbit anti-Iba1 antibody (1:500) followed by donkey anti rabbit Alexa 568-conjugated IgG (1:400) secondary antibodies for 4 h at RT. Take images with a fluorescent microscope (Figure 5).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
