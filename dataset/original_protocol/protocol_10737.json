    "1. Synthesis of Fluorescently Labeled Acryloyl-PEG-RGDS\nReact the RGDS peptide with acryloyl-PEG- succinimidyl carboxymethyl ester (aPEG-SCM, PEG MW: 3400 g/mol) and N-N diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) at 1.2:1:2 molar ratios in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) under argon at room temperature overnight.  \nConfirm conjugation by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Add 1 μl of aPEG-RGDS reaction solution to a sample spot on the MALDI target and dry. Prepare a saturated solution of Universal MALDI Matrix in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and vortex for 1 min. Add ~1 μl of this solution to the same sample spot. Repeat the procedure for aPEG-SCM for comparison. Load and analyze. The molecular weight of aPEG-RGDS should be greater than aPEG-SCM (Figure 2).\nTo conjugate the fluorophore, add an equimolar amount of Alexa Fluor 350 carboxylic acid (succinimydyl ester), dissolved in a minimal volume of DMSO, to the aPEG-RGDS reaction solution from 1.1 and react under argon at room temperature overnight. \nPurify aPEG-RGDS-350 by dialyzing (MW 3500 Da) against DI-H2O at 4 °C for 48 hr at 1,000:1 volumetric ratio, exchanging dialysate at least twice per day. \nFreeze dry the purified aPEG-RGDS-350 in a Labconco Freezone Plus or equivalent freeze dry system and store at -20 °C. \n2. Preparation of a 2D Mold and Fabrication of a 2D PEG Gel with Alternating RGDS-350 Layers\nPrepare hydrophobic glass slides. Place clean glass slides into a glass dish in a vacuum oven. Heat to 80 °C for 30 min to completely dry the surfaces. Place dish with slides in a fume hood and add 250 μl Sigmacote to each slide, gently rocking for 30 sec to coat entire surface. Thoroughly rinse the coated slides with 100% methanol, followed by washing in distilled water, soaking twice for 5 min in at least 10 ml.",
    "Cut silicone spacers (0.8 mm thick) with 10 mm biopsy punches. \nAutoclave the silicone spacers and Sigmacote-treated glass slides. \nFormulate solutions for each respective layer in individual microfuge tubes by mixing PEG diacrylate (PEGda) precursor (final concentration 15% w/v) with different amounts of iodixanol (60% stock solution in water) to yield varying final concentrations (e.g. 40%, 30%, 20% and 10%), supplementing the remaining volume with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to obtain solutions of graded densities. In a similar manner, for alternating layers, mix aPEG-RGDS-350 (final concentration 8 mM) with iodixanol and PBS to yield various concentrations (e.g. 35%, 25%, and 15%). \nAdd photoinitiator (2-Hydroxy-4'-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone, 333mg/ml stock in N-vinyl pyrrolidone) to each solution for various layers (10 μl of stock solution per ml of each layer solution). Photoinitiator is added last to prevent polymerization before layering of the gels in the mold, as it is sensitive to light.    \nSubsequent steps of this protocol will be performed in a biosafety cabinet to ensure sterility.\nFilter-sterilize each solution using a sterile 1 ml syringe and 0.2 μm filter. Assemble the mold setup by sandwiching the spacer between two Sigmacore-treated glass slides and secure with clamps placing as depicted in Figure 1.    \nCast the layered gels by adding the most dense solution (e.g. PEGda with 40% iodixanol) first, followed by a less dense solution (e.g. aPEG-RGDS-350 with 35% iodixanol). Repeat the alternate layering to achieve several layers of desired composition and densities as shown in Figure 1.",
    "Irradiate the mold with 365 nm light for 3 min using a portable UVR-9000 lamp. Allow the polymerized gels to cure for 5 min. Remove the clamps, then gently lift the top glass slide and the mold; the stratified DGMP gels will remain on the slides. Using a sterile spatula, carefully place the gels in a 50 ml tube containing sterile PBS or culture medium for washing.\nWash the polymerized gels in PBS at 1,000:1 volumetric ratio, exchanging buffer at least twice per day to remove the density modifier, photoinitiator, and unreacted polymer. Alternatively, PBS may be exchanged with cell growth medium. Store the DGMP gels in PBS or growth medium for the cell culture experiment outlined in Step 3.\nTo visualize alternating layers, arrange DGMP gel (these gels will not be usable for cell culture) along a ruler on the sample tray of a VersaDoc gel documentation unit. Expose the gels in 350 nm; the exposure time will vary depending on the concentration of the fluorophore.  Alternating dark and blue bands in the DGMP hydrogel demonstrate formation of discrete layers of distinct chemical composition (Figure 3). \n3. 2D Cell Culture on DGMP Gels\nFor gels incorporating RGDS peptide, use adhesion dependent cells, such as C2C12 myoblasts.\n  \nGently insert DGMP gels (stored in PBS) into the wells of 48-well cell culture plates using a sterile cell scraper in a biosafety cabinet. \n  \nPre-warm growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v 100x penicillin-streptomycin solution) and PBS in a water bath set at 37 °C.",
    "Wash a 60% confluent plate (10 mm) of C2C12 cells three times with PBS. Aspirate off PBS and harvest cells by adding 1 ml of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and incubating at 37 °C for 2 min. Resuspend the cells in growth medium and count cells. Seed the DGMP gel-containing cell culture well with C2C12 myoblasts (20,000 cells/ cm2). Incubate the cells at 37 °C in 5%CO2/95% relative humidity. Gently exchange medium after 4 hr, careful not to remove lightly adhered cells.\nAfter 24 hr, the attachment of C2C12 myoblasts on the RGDS-containing layers of DGMP gels may be confirmed by epifluorescence and phase contrast microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200)."
