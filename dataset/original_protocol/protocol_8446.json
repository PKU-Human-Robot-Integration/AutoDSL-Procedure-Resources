    "All experiments described were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n1. Generate Slides of Frozen Mouse Skin\nEuthanize mice in accordance with institution policy.\n\tNote: Follow institutional policy for protective clothing. All protocols involving animals must be approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee.\nRemove the mouse’s hair with an animal hair trimmer.\nMake incisions in the skin using scissors. Using forceps, lift the skin away from the mouse. Using scissors, cut the skin section away.\nFill the cryomold with freezing reagent compound (see Table of Materials).\nPlace skin sections into filled cryomolds using needle-nosed forceps. Orient skin so that tissue slices will generate a cross section of the skin from the epidermis to the dermis, hypodermis and muscle (Figure 2).\n\tNote: If possible, mount experimental and control mice together in the same cryomold so they can be sectioned onto the same slide and processed together. Take care not to create bubbles.\nPlace cryomold on the flat surface of a block of dry ice in an ice bucket and let freeze. Continue to observe the orientation of the skin. Adjust if necessary.\n\tNote: Wear cryogenic gloves when handling dry ice.\nTransfer cryomolds into a -80 °C freezer for storage. Samples can be maintained in the freezer for approximately 3 months without significant loss of enzymatic activity. Do not let frozen sections dry out.\nUsing a cryostat at -20 °C, slice tissue to create sections 7 - 10 µm thick for the best skin morphology21.\n2. Preparing Slides for Staining\nEstablish the set of slides to be tested. Include a control slide on which NAD will be withheld and another control slide on which the substrate, lactate, will be withheld. Include a positive control slide from a frozen tissue block previously investigated.",
    "Briefly fix slides containing skin sections with 4% formalin for 5 min either by pipetting 1 mL of 4% formalin onto the slide, or when processing multiple slides, by dipping slides into a container containing 4% formalin.\n\tNote: The fixation will ensure the skin does not peel off from the slides during the following procedures and preserve the skin morphology.\n\tCaution: Formalin is a carcinogen and hazardous; wear gloves, do not let it touch your skin and perform this step in a chemical fume hood.\nWash slides with at least 1 mL phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, per slide either by pipetting or dipping.\n3. Preparing Staining Solution\nVortex together reagents for lactate dehydrogenase activity staining (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 750 µM NADP, 80 µM phenazine methosulfate (PMS), 600 µM nitrotetrazolium blue chloride, and 30 mM lactate) in an appropriately sized tube depending on the amount of staining solution required.\n\tNote: 1 mL is sufficient to completely cover one slide.\nPrepare a second solution in which all reagents are present except NAD. Prepare a third solution in which all reagents are present except lactate.\n4. Incubate Slides in Staining Solution\nGently pipet the staining solution or control solutions onto the prepared slides covering the section in its entirety (1 mL is sufficient for one slide). If multiple slides are being processed together, dip all slides into the staining solution at the same time (make sure the container has enough solution to completely cover the tissue section).\nIncubate the slides in a humidified environment at 37 °C in the dark. If staining solution is on top of the slide, place the slide in a humidified environment to prevent evaporation.\n5. Monitor the Slides",
    "Monitor the conversion of the staining solution from clear to blue by visual inspection. When the samples have reached the desired level of blueness, stop the reaction by removing the staining solution.\n\tNote: For skin, 10 min is sufficient. The time will depend on the organ and the enzymatic activity.\nRinse slides with phosphate buffered saline by pipetting (1 mL is sufficient for each slide) or dipping.\n\tNote: Any samples that will be compared to each other must be maintained in staining solution for the same amount of time.\n6. Counterstain and mount\nPipet a counterstain onto the slides when the slides have reached an appropriate level of blueness.\n\tNote: Counterstains that turn the nuclei red or green will provide good contrast with the blue created by the formazan precipitant.\nMount with aqueous or non-aqueous mounting medium22. One to three drops (40 - 50 µL) of mounting medium is sufficient depending on the size of the cover slip.\n7. Image slides and quantify\nImage slides under a light microscope. Take photographs of experimental and control samples and all negative controls at 10X, 20X, and 40X magnification.\nDetermine the intensity of blue stain in different regions with image analysis software.\nSubscription Required.
