In vitro fluorescent matrix degradation assay for Entamoeba histolytica Coating of glass coverslips with fluorescent matrix Clean the glass coverslips with acetone, air dry and sterilize them by autoclaving before use.Further, handle the coverslips under sterile conditions inside the laminar air flow hood. Transfer the coverslips to a four well tissue culture plate using ethanol wiped forceps.Coat each coverslip with 0.01% poly-L-lysine using 80 μl of poly-L-lysine solution per coverslip for 20 min at room temperature. Air dry the solution under the hood.Wash the coverslips by adding 500 μl of sterile 1x PBS gently to the side of the well and incubating for 5 min each. The poly-L-lysine coated side should face up during the washes. After each wash aspirate it gently using a sterile glass pasteur pipette attached to a vacuum pump and repeat the washes for three times.After the third PBS wash, add 500 μl of ice cold 0.5% glutaraldehyde to each well such that the coverslips are immersed and incubate under dark at room temperature for 15 min.Aspirate the glutaraldehyde solution gently by tilting the plate to an angle such that coverslips are not disturbed and again wash with sterile 1x PBS. Repeat the washes for three times.Make a humid chamber using tissue paper and 70% ethanol. Neatly make a stack of tissue paper by folding it over and moisten it by spraying with 70% ethanol. Place the stack in a sterile Petri dish to make a humid chamber. Place a neatly cut parafilm over the moist tissue paper stack and press it gently so that it sticks well.Now, place appropriate number of drops of 50 μl of prewarm (37 °C, preferably in a water bath) fluorescently labeled fibronectin (100 μg/ml) over the parafilm according to the number of coverslips being coated.",
    "Carefully lift the coverslips from the wells holding at the edges using a pair of forceps and place them with their poly-L-lysine coated side facing downwards on the drop of the fluorescent fibronectin on the parafilm. While placing the coverslips, ensure that there is no air bubble trapped beneath them. If so, gently press the coverslips with the forceps to eliminate the trapped air bubbles.Incubate under safe light in a 37 °C incubator for an hour.After an hour, remove the coverslips from the incubator. Now coverslips should be handled in safe light. Lift the coverslips carefully one-by-one with the help of the forceps without scratching the matrix and place them with their coated side facing up in a fresh tissue culture plate.Again wash them gently with 1x PBS as done previously in step 4. Meanwhile, prepare fresh 5 mg/ml solution of sodium borohydride by dissolving it in 1x PBS. Add 500 μl of sodium borohydride per well such that the coverslips are immersed in it. Incubate under dark at room temperature for 15 min. As sodium borohydride bubbles upon dissolution, make sure that the bubbles do not settle on the coverslips by gently rocking them back and forth.Wash the coverslips with 1x PBS for three times and then finally sterilize by soaking them into 70% ethanol for 10 min at room temperature. Further wash the coverslips with sterile 1x PBS and then finally add 500 μl of complete BI medium to each well and incubate at 37 °C in an incubator for an hour.Coverslips are now ready to be used. If you do not want to use them immediately, sterilize them using 70% ethanol and then store them at 4 °C under dark for up to a week.",
    "Sample preparation for the assay Take a confluent tube of Entamoeba histolytica HM1: IMSS strain in logarithmic phase and remove the used medium. Add 10 ml of fresh complete BI medium and transfer the glass tube on ice for 5 min so as to detach the cells. The culture volume in the glass tube is 13 ml.Now gently tap the tube to completely detach the trophozoites and transfer in a 15 ml conical tube. Take a small aliquot to count the number of cells using haemocytometer. Spin them down at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Now resuspend the cell pellet in warm complete BI medium to a concentration of 40 x 104 cells/ml.Add 0.5 ml of cells i.e. 2 x 105 cells per well over the fluorescently matrix coated coverslips and place the tissue culture plate inside a GasPak EZ pouch to maintain anaerobic conditions. Place the whole setup in 37 °C incubator. Incubate for 36-48 h at 37 °C under dark.Close to the end of incubation, warm an aliquot of 1x PBS and 4% PFA at 37 °C for further use.Preparing samples for fluorescence microscopy Aspirate the medium by tilting the plate to an angle without disturbing the coverslips. Now wash the cells with warm sterile 1x PBS and fix the cells immediately using 4% PFA. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min under dark.After fixation, wash the sample with 1x PBS and permeabilize with 0.1% Triton-X-100 at room temperature for 10 min. Wash again and block the samples with 1% BSA in PBS for an hour at room temperature.To label with Alexa 568 Phalloidin, dilute phalloidin in a ratio of 1:100 in the blocking solution (1% BSA in PBS).",
    "Transfer the coverslips carefully to a humid chamber again and add 50 μl of Alexa 568 Phalloidin to each coverslip and incubate under dark at room temperature for an hour.Subsequently, wash the samples by again placing them back in the tissue culture plate and adding 1x PBS.After the final wash, mount the sample using mounting medium. Let the samples air dry at room temperature under dark.Examine the fluorescence of the matrix and the samples using epifluorescence or confocal microscope with appropriate light source and filter sets. Since the matrix layer formed is very thin the samples should be focused accurately so that the entire field of view has uniform fluorescence. The degradation of the matrix can be observed as loss of fluorescence around the cells and would appear as a dark halo surrounding the cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160320/20160320192751_8651.jpgFigure 1.
