  "procedures": [
    "Our protocol has been optimized to obtain histones of high purity and sufficient yield for mass spectrometry analyses while preserving the histones’ post-translational modifications (PTMs). Since the histone content in relation to body weight is rather low in C. elegans and since some loss occurs throughout the protocol, a substantial amount of starting material is needed. Thus, large quantities of animals need to be grown, which is most easily achieved using liquid culture.\nThe actual required amount of animals will depend on the purpose of the experiment. Normally, 0.5−1 million animals are sufficient to study most of the histone PTMs in adult wild-type animals. However, if one would like to detect particularly rare PTMs or analyze a C. elegans mutant that bears lower histone content, a higher starting amount is required. Here, it is important to know that in adult C. elegans, the tissue contributing the most to histones is the germ line. Thus, any mutant that lacks or has an impaired germline may need to be grown on an increased scale to ultimately yield the same histone amount as wild-type animals.\nMaterials\nDesired worm strains, grown on 100-mm-diameter Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0011]), e.g.:\n               \nWild-type C. elegans strain (N2)\nSlow-aging C. elegans strain with a hypomorphic insulin/IGF receptor allele (daf-2(e1370ts)III) (CB1370)\nFast-aging C. elegans strain with a null allele for DAF-16/FOXO (daf-16(mu86lf)I) (CF1038)\n150-mm NGM plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0011])\n50× OP50-1: Stationary OP50-1 E.coli culture (obtained from the CGC), 50-fold concentrated relative to an overnight LB culture, and resuspended in S-Basal (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0013])\nM9 buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0010])\nHypochlorite solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0009])\n1 M MgSO4 stock solution\nS-Complete medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0014])\n5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FUDR; Sigma-Aldrich, F0503)\nSterile Milli-Q water or equivalent\nNuclear Isolation Buffer (NIB; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0012])\n200 mM AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl) bezenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; Sigma-Aldrich, A8456)",

For each sample/condition, start with five 100-mm-diameter NGM plates that are crowded with unsynchronized animals. Transfer these animals to ten 150-mm-diameter NGM plates each seeded with 1 ml of 50× OP50-1 E. coli. Incubate plates at the desired temperature until the plates are crowded with gravid adults. Typically, the growth temperature for wild-type animals is 20°C. However, depending on the strain used (e.g., when it carries a temperature-sensitive allele), other temperatures in the range from 15°C to 25°C may be preferred.\nIn order to prevent worms from digging into the agar, which would cause starvation and thereby affect the animals’ physiology, avoid incubating them for extended periods of time on 150-mm diameter plates (2 days at maximum).\n2. Wash worms off the plates using 12 ml of M9 buffer.\n3. Collect worms in a 15-ml tube and centrifuge 1 min at 1500 × g to pellet the worms. Discard the supernatant.\n4. Repeat this harvesting/washing step until all worms have been removed from the plate and the supernatant from step 3 is clear (approximately three washes).",
    "5. After the final wash, resuspend worms in 7.5 ml sterile M9 buffer.\nIf your worm pellet is bigger than 1 ml, split the sample into multiple tubes and add M9 to 7.5 ml final volume, to bring the pellet volume below 1 ml.\n6. Add 2.5 ml of fresh hypochlorite solution.\n7. Vortex tube for 30 s.\n8. Examine under a stereomicroscope to determine if most worm corpses have disappeared and many released eggs can be seen.\n9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 until all eggs have been released and barely any corpses remain. Overall, this bleaching (steps 7 to 9) will take approximately 6 min.\n10. Centrifuge the tube 1 min at 1500 × g to pellet the released eggs.\n11. Carefully take off the supernatant and discard it.\n12. Wash eggs at least five times, each time with 10 ml M9 buffer, centrifuging 1 min at 1500 × g between washes.\nMake sure to go through the first two washes quickly, as a toxic amount of bleach will still remain during the first washes.\n13. Spin down eggs 1 min at 1500 × g, and resuspend eggs in 10 ml M9 buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgSO4.\n14. Rotate the tube containing the eggs for 1 day at room temperature or 2 days at 15°C.\nLarge-scale growth of C. elegans in liquid culture\n15. Check that there are no unhatched eggs left, and determine the concentration of L1s (first stage larvae) by placing three spots of 5 or 10 µl of the C. elegans suspension on an NGM plate and counting the L1 larvae under a stereomicroscope.\n16. For each sample/condition, prepare a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask containing 1 L of S-Complete Medium.\n17. Seed the 1 L of S-Complete Medium with ∼80 ml of 50× OP50-1 bacteria.",
    "Prior to setting up the liquid culture, make sure to prepare enough 50× OP50-1. You may also have to grow more OP50-1 during the experiment, to refeed the animals. 50× OP50-1 can be stored for a few days at 4°C.\n18. Check the OD at 600 nm (OD600), e.g., using a spectrophotometer. The OD should be between 2 and 4. For accurate results, use disposable cuvettes, use S-Complete Medium as blank, and dilute your culture 1:10.\n19. Inoculate the culture with synchronized L1s from the hatched egg preparation. The L1 concentration should not exceed 1000 animals/ml. (e.g., for 1 L of culture, inoculate with 0.5−1 million L1s).\n20. Incubate worm culture in a shaking incubator at the desired temperature and 140 rpm. Typically, the growth temperature for wild-type animals is 20°C. However, depending on the strain used (e.g., when it carries a temperature-sensitive allele), other temperatures in the range from 15°C to 25°C may be preferred.\n21. Check the OD600 of the culture daily and keep it between 2 and 4 A. Add 50× OP50-1 bacteria when needed.\n22. Keep worms in culture until the desired developmental or adult stage. Up to that point, replace S-Complete Medium every 2-3 days with fresh medium and new bacteria. This is done by transferring the culture into 500-ml conical centrifuge tubes, allowing the worms to settle by gravity for ∼10 min, removing the supernatant, and replacing it with new S-Complete Medium and 50× OP50-1 E. coli as in steps 16-18.\nTry to maintain the same worm/bacteria/medium ratio throughout the whole experiment, to have stable and reproducible growth conditions.",
    "If you would like to analyze adult stages beyond day 1 of adulthood, the production of progeny will interfere with the experiment, leading to overcrowding of the culture with animals from the next generation. To avoid this, conditionally sterile C. elegans mutants (e.g., the strain CF512) can be used, or a sterilizing drug can be added prior to progeny production [e.g., 50 µM 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FUDR)].\nHarvest worms at a defined time point\nFrom this point on, use cold buffers and cold centrifuges, and work on ice or in a cold room.\n23. Transfer the culture into 500-ml conical centrifuge tubes.\nIf the worm culture contains undesired eggs or worms in early larval stages, 40-µm cell strainers can be used to remove them by filtering the culture before proceeding to the next steps.\n24. Allow the worms to settle for 10 min on ice, then centrifuge 3 min at 1500 × g, 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nIf you only have a limited number of 500-ml conical centrifuge tubes available, you can harvest more than 500 ml of culture in the same tube by repeating steps 23-24.\n25. Transfer the worms to 50-ml centrifuge tubes.\n26. Wash the worms with M9 buffer and collect them by spinning them down 2 min at 1500 × g, 4°C. Repeat this wash step until the supernatant is cleared of bacteria (approximately three washes).\n27. Transfer the worms to 15-ml tubes.\n28. Wash the worms once with 10 ml Milli-Q water, then centrifuge 2 min at 1500 × g, 4°C.\n29. Take off supernatant to just above the worm pellet.\n30. Mix one volume of worm pellet with two volumes of ice-cold NIB+ buffer.\nTo make NIB+ buffer, freshly supplement Nuclear Isolation Buffer (NIB) with protease inhibitors and stabilizing agents:\n         \n500 µM AEBSF\n5 nM microcystin",

    "The following acid extraction protocol is optimized to universally isolate all histone proteins and their variants. However, for the more efficient extraction of certain histone variants with unique biochemical and biophysical properties, other methods might be considered. For instance, extraction by diluted perchloric acid is a powerful tool to specifically extract more unstructured histone H1 variants (Zougman & Wiśniewski, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0039]).\nAfter acid extraction, we achieve histone purification and enrichment by subjecting the extracted material to ion-exchange chromatography. Histone proteins are rich in basic amino acid residues, and are thus positively charged. In vivo, this promotes their interaction with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA. In vitro, we can make use of this property. Due to their positive charge, histones have a high affinity for cation-exchange resins, which allows for their efficient separation from other contaminants (see Rodriguez-Collazo, Leuba, & Zlatanova, 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0028]).\nMaterials\nFrozen worm beads in NIB+ buffer (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-prot-0001], step 31)\nNuclear Isolation Buffer (NIB; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0012])\n200 mM AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl) bezenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; Sigma-Aldrich, A8456)\n2.5 µM microcystin (Sigma-Aldrich, M4194)\n5 M sodium butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich, B5887)\n0.9 M dithiothreitol (DTT; ThermoFisher Scientific, R0861)\n100× cOmpleteTM EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 11873580001)\n0.1 M spermine (Sigma-Aldrich, S3256)\n0.1 M spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich, 05292)\n2× Buffer H (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0002])\n5 M NaCl\nB-Hypo-Lys Buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0001])\n0.4 N H2SO4 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0006])\nSP Sepharose High Performance resin (GE Healthcare, 17-1087-01)\nEquilibration buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0005])\n1 M Tris·Cl, pH 8.0 (Current Protocols, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0005])\n0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0 (Current Protocols, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0005])\nHistone wash buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0008])\nHistone elution buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-rec-0007])\nTrichloroacetic acid (TCA)\nAcetone\n50 mM NaHCO3\nPierceTM BCA Protein Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, 23225; also see Current Protocols article: Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0008])\n1 M Tris base\nMilli-Q water or equivalent\n2× Laemmli sample buffer (see Current Protocols article: Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0008])",

Using this device, grind until the worms are entirely destroyed and no worm fragments remain visible upon checking a small amount of the ground material under a stereomicroscope after thawing.\nFor us, using a CryoMill (Retsch), this takes five consecutive cycles of 3 min at 25 Hz followed by 2 min cooling at 5 Hz. Those settings are only a suggestion and were optimized for 0.5−1 million adult wild-type animals. They might need further adjustment depending on the starting amount of C. elegans, their developmental or adult stage, and their genotype.\nPAUSE POINT: Collect all powder from the grinder and transfer it immediately to −80°C, where it can be stored long term.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Perform all subsequent steps on ice at 4°C to avoid enzymatic activities that could alter histone PTMs.",

If the pH is below 7-8, immediately add some 1 M Tris base to increase the pH accordingly.\nPAUSE POINT: Purified histones can be kept at −80°C until later use.\nQuality control of the histone extraction by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining",
    "To assess the purity of the extracted histones before proceeding to MS analysis, samples are subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Core histones are low-molecular-weight proteins, migrating between ∼11 and 15 kDa. High-percentage (15%) or gradient (4%-20%) Tris-glycine gels are recommended to efficiently resolve them. Starting material, purified histones, and any optional samples collected throughout the purification can be run together on the same gel. See Figure 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-fig-0002] for an example of how the final histone sample purity compares with the original starting material (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-fig-0002]).\n66. Estimate histone concentration using a BCA or Bradford assay (see Current Protocols article: Olson & Markwell, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0026]).\n67. Mix approximately 1 µg of the histone extract with 2× Laemmli buffer.\n68. Denature the proteins for 5 min at 95°C.\n69. Run the sample on a pre-cast 15% or 4%-20% pre-cast Tris-glycine gel using Tris-glycine SDS (TGS) running buffer (also see Current Protocols article: Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0008]).\n70. Stain the gel by slowly shaking in Coomassie solution for 1 hr at room temperature.\n71. Destain the gel by slowly shaking in destaining solution. Replace the destaining solution every 30 min until the histone bands have become visible and the gel background is fully destained.",
    "In this protocol, the histone samples from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-prot-0002] are prepared and analyzed by MS. We use a bottom-up MS approach, where we first cleave the histones by trypsin into small peptides (5-15 amino acids in length), separate them by nano-scale reversed-phase chromatography (nanoLC), and then quantify them by tandem MS (MS/MS) (Karch, Sidoli, & Garcia, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0015]; Sidoli, Bhanu, Karch, Wang, & Garcia, 2016a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0029]). However, our approach differs from standard protocols by the addition of two alkylation steps. First, we know that trypsin cuts after lysine and arginine residues and that histones are very basic, containing many of these amino acids. As a consequence, trypsin would normally cleave histones into peptides that are too small for optimal MS/MS analysis (Garcia et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0009]). To address this, we use propionic acid to alkylate the ζ-amino groups of unmodified or monomethylated lysine residues, which prevents tryptic digestion at those sites, resulting in peptides that are longer and much more suitable. Second, once tryptic digestion is complete, we again use propionic acid, this time to alkylate each peptide's newly generated N-terminus. This aids the separation of peptides during nanoLC and further improves MS/MS results. To learn more, also about alternative MS approaches to study histone PTMs and variants, please consult Karch et al. (2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0015]).",
    "Once the MS/MS data have been collected, their analysis is challenging, most importantly because histones carry so many PTMs that can occur alone or in combination with others in a given peptide. This results in a large number of possible peptides that need to be distinguished from others. Another challenge is the existence of isobaric peptides that have the same m/z and similar elution times. Thus, we have developed a software application called EpiProfile (Yuan et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0034], 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0035]) to overcome these issues and provide a straightforward solution for the analysis of histone MS/MS data. Here, we use a C. elegans−adapted version of this software, called EpiProfile 2.0-Ce.\nMaterials\nPurified histone samples in 50 mM NaHCO3 or Milli-Q water (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-prot-0002], step 64)\n100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), pH 8.0\nGlacial acetic acid\nPropionic anhydride\nIsopropanol\nAmmonium hydroxide (NH4OH)\nTrypsin (Promega)\nWash buffer: 0.1% acetic acid in water\nMethanol\nElution buffer: 75% (v/v) acetonitrile/5% acetic acid/20% water\nnanoLC buffer A: 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water\nnanoLC buffer B: 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 75% acetonitrile/25% water\nVacuum centrifuge (e.g., Eppendorf Vacufuge)\npH paper\nVortex (e.g., Vortex Genie 2)\nThermal block (e.g., Eppendorf Thermomix)\n1.5- or 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nHome-made C18 columns or stage-tips\nnano C18 column (length: 25 cm, silica tip (outer diameter: 360 µm, inner diameter: 75 µm; New Objective)\nOrbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific)\nPropionylation of lysine residues\n1. Use ∼20 µg of purified histones from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-prot-0002], dry samples down in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspend them in 25 µl of 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0. Adjust sample concentration with concentrated NH4HCO3 if samples were in Milli-Q water, or dry samples down in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspend with NH4HCO3 if samples were in NaHCO3.",
    "2. Use a P10 pipette and spot some sample onto pH paper, to ensure that the pH is around 8.0. Otherwise adjust it by adding glacial acetic acid or powdered NH4HCO3.\n3. Make fresh propionylation reagent by combining propionic anhydride and isopropanol in a 1:3 (v/v) ratio.\nCAUTION: Use fume hood when working with propionic anhydride.\n4. Add 10 µl of propionylation reagent to the sample and vortex briefly.\n5. Check the pH with pH paper. It now should be between 4 and 6. Immediately add 3-7 µl NH4OH to increase the pH to ∼8.\nNever allow the pH to increase above 10, as other residues such as serine can be propionylated at high pH.\n6. Incubate samples 15 min at 37°C.\n7. Dry down to less than 5 µl in a vacuum centrifuge. This might take several minutes.\n8. Repeat steps 1-7 once again with fresh reagents to ensure that >95% of the reactions are complete.\n9. Resuspend samples in 100 µl of 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0.\nTryptic digestion of the propionylated histones\n10. Add trypsin in a 1:20 ratio, i.e., 1 µg trypsin per 20 µg histones.\n11. Incubate 6 hr to overnight at 37°C.\n12. Quench trypsin by freezing at −80°C or by adding 5 µl glacial acetic acid to lower the pH to ∼4.\n13.

Dry sample down to less than 5 µl in a vacuum centrifuge. This might take several minutes.",
    "17. Add 200 µl of wash buffer to the sample. Check that the pH is below 4.0 with pH paper. If needed, adjust the pH by adding glacial acetic acid.\nPAUSE POINT: Sample can be stored at −80°C.\nSample desalting with C18 Stage-Tip\nThis step will remove salt from the digested sample, which otherwise may interfere with the nanoLC-MS/MS analysis.\n18. Construct home-made C18 columns or stage-tips as described in Sidoli et al. (2016a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0029]). Briefly, punch a C18 material disk with a P1000 pipette tip previously cut to make the hole larger, push the minidisk out of the P1000 tip with the help of a fused silica capillary, and place it firmly to the bottom of a P100/200 pipette tip. If desalting more than 25 µg of protein, use two C18 minidisks in the same P100/P200 tip.\n19. Place the column or stage-tips in a 1.5-ml or 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. Use a centrifuge adapter to hold the column or tip in place.\n20. Activate the resin by adding 50 µl methanol to the column/tip and spinning 30-60 s at 500 × g.\n21. Repeat step 20.\nFrom here on, work swiftly to avoid drying of the column/tip.\n22. Equilibrate the column by adding 200 µl wash buffer and spinning 30-60 s at 500 × g.\n23. Discard flow-through in the collection tube and repeat step 22.\n24. Apply sample from step 17 to the column/stage-tip.\n25. Centrifuge 2-5 min at 200 × g, until all the sample has passed through the column.\n26. Wash the column with 50 µl wash buffer and centrifuge 30-60 s at 500 × g.\n27. Repeat step 26.\n28. Place the column into a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and elute the sample with 75 µl elution buffer by spinning 2-5 min at 200 × g.",
    "29. Repeat step 28.\n30. Dry down the desalted sample to less than 5 µl in a vacuum centrifuge.\nPAUSE POINT: Sample can be stored at −80°C.\nMS acquisition\nIn this protocol, bottom-up MS data are acquired through a combination of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) with targeted MS2 scans to distinguish coeluting isobaric peptides (see Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-tbl-0003]). To eliminate the need for targeting coeluting isobaric peptides, data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods can be a good alternative to DDA, although they are not recommended for identifying unknown peptides. For details on how to perform DIA consult Karch et al. (2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0015]).\nTable 3.\n                Mass List of the Targeted Isobaric Peptidesa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-tbl3-note-0001_65]\ntable:\n﻿Mass list of targeted isobaric peptides,Mass list of targeted isobaric peptides,Mass list of targeted isobaric peptides,Mass list of targeted isobaric peptides,Mass list of targeted isobaric peptides\nTargeted isobaric peptide,m/z,Z,t start (min),t stop (min)\nH3K36me3/K27me2K36me1,543.986,3,20,40\nH3.3K36me3/K27me2K36me1,558.6674,3,20,40\nH3K9ac/K14ac,528.2988,2,20,40\nH3S10phK14ac/S10phK9ac,568.279,2,25,40\nH3K18me1/K23me1,584.8561,2,30,50\nH2A 4_18 3ac,862.9863,2,30,50\nH2A 4_18 2ac,869.9941,2,30,50\nH4 4_17 3ac,754.9308,2,30,50\nH2A 4_18 1ac,877.0019,2,30,50\nH3K27me1/K36me1,829.4728,2,30,50\nH3.3L2K36me3/K27me2K36me1,574.02,3,30,60\nH4 4_17 2ac,761.9386,2,33,50\nH3.3K27me1/K36me1,851.4859,2,35,50\nH4 4_17 1ac,768.9465,2,35,55\nH2AV 1_21 3ac,794.7711,3,35,60\nH2AV 1_21 2ac,799.443,3,40,60\nH3K18ac/K23ac,570.8404,2,40,60\nH2AV 1_21 1ac,804.1148,3,40,60\nH3.3L2K27me1/K36me1,874.5251,2,50,70\na All the isobaric peptides targeted for MS2 are listed, including their m/z, their charge state (z), and the retention time coordinates (start and end) during which elution of the respective peptide is expected. Retention coordinates were determined empirically in previous test runs using comparable equipment.\n31. Prepare nanoLC Buffers A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (0.1% formic acid in a solution of 75% acetonitrile/25% water).\n32. Program a 70-min HPLC gradient: starting at 4% B, then linearly increasing B to 35% over 60 min, followed by a linear increase to 95% B over 10 min. The flow rate should be 300 nl/min.",
    "33. We use a nano C18 column, 25 cm long with a silica tip. The eluate is electro-sprayed into the mass spectrometer directly via the column's tip.\n34. Program the MS acquisition method for DDA combined with targeted scans. Targeted peptides take priority. See Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-tbl-0003] for a detailed mass list of the targeted isobaric peptides.\n35. Resuspend the sample to ∼1 µg/µl in Buffer A.\n36. Load 1-3 µg of sample onto the nanoLC column.\n37. Run the nanoLC-MS/MS method as programmed in steps 31 and 32.\nHistone peptides are very similar to any other tryptic peptides. Hence, your basic MS setup (column, instrument, and instrument settings) should be the same as you would use for other peptide analyses.\nData analysis using EpiProfile 2.0-Ce\nAlthough quantification of histone peptides can be achieved manually, e.g., by using the Xcalibur QualBrowser (Thermo) or by using the freeware Skyline (MacLean et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0021]), we recommend the use of EpiProfile. This software has been specifically developed for the quantification of histone PTMs and variants from MS/MS data, including both DDA and DIA approaches (Yuan et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0034], 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0035]). EpiProfile is a freely available Matlab-based automated tool that reads raw data files and outputs tables of quantified histone peptides (see Table 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-tbl-0004] for an example), layouts (MS1 elution profiles, Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-fig-0003]), and annotated MS/MS spectra used for identification. EpiProfile is very easy to use and can quantify coeluting isobaric peptides (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-fig-0003] and 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-fig-0003]). Since its original release, EpiProfile has been adapted for the study of histones in different organisms including humans, mice, C. elegans, and yeast. We recommend consulting previous publications if you would like to obtain a deeper understanding of EpiProfile (Yuan et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0034], 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-bib-0035]).\nTable 4.\n                Example of EpiProfile 2.0-Ce Quantification Outputa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpps.114#cpps114-tbl4-note-0001_76]\ntable:",
