    "This protocol is used to study acute inflammation in the skin of mice. The tissue is later stained with appropriate antibodies and imaged to determine the percentage of transendothelial migration (TEM) events. We developed this protocol to study TEM in vivo.\nThis protocol is best suited for experiments in which the purpose is to test drugs or treatments that are expected to block inflammation. Mice that have been exposed to such drugs or treatments are challenged with a dose of the inflammatory substance croton oil administered to the ears. Under control conditions where mice have not received any treatment, the ears become acutely inflamed; however, if the tested drug has anti-inflammatory properties, it is expected that the ears will have decreased inflammation despite croton oil application.\nCAUTION: Croton oil is a stimulant of inflammation and at high concentrations can cause severe irritation to exposed skin. The active ingredient is phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C and a known tumor promoter. It is therefore important to wear gloves when handling the oil. We recommend that you double glove and keep the bottle of croton oil in a secondary containment of a 50-ml conical tube to prevent potential spillage.\nNOTE: This protocol starts with croton oil application. Any experimental conditions to be tested must be performed on the mice prior to the steps listed in this protocol. There is no definite number of mice that should be processed per batch, but 6 mice or fewer would be reasonable for the workload.\nMaterials\nCarrier solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0004])\nCroton oil mixture (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0005])\nMice (we have tested FVB, C57BL/6, and 129S backgrounds)\nNairTM hair-removal lotion\n1× DPBS without calcium and magnesium (Corning, product no. 21-031-CV)\nFixing solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0006])\nPermeabilization buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0007])\nAnti-PECAM 2H8 (Millipore Sigma, cat. no.

Prepare the carrier and croton oil mixtures in two 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes.\n2. Set the air flow rate to 2 liters/min and anesthetize the mice with isoflurane. Wait for the mouse's breathing to slow down enough to indicate a sufficient plane of anesthesia.\nThis procedure does not have to be performed under anesthesia if the investigator is comfortable “scruffing” the mouse or if there is a gentle way to immobilize the mouse's head. For consistency, the croton oil and carrier mixtures must be applied evenly and completely, which is easier when the mouse's head is immobilized.\n3. Pipet 10 μl carrier mixture onto the back of the left ear and 10 μl of the same carrier mixture onto the front side.\n4. Pipet 10 μl croton oil onto the front and back of the right ear. Repeat for all mice.\n5. Leave mice in cage with access to a heating pad for 5 hr.\n6. Sacrifice mice by CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation.",
    "7. Rub Nair on both sides of the ears using a cotton swab, leave for a minute, and wipe off with disposable wipes to remove hair. Cut the ears off the mouse. Pour 12 ml of 1× DPBS into each of two 15-ml conical tubes, and place an ear into each tube, keeping track of which ear received which treatment. Shake the tubes to wash the Nair off the ears.\nThe bubbles will automatically bring the ears to the surface of DPBS, so they can be easily removed with tweezers. The DPBS can be reused for more mice, but it is advisable to pour fresh DPBS when it is murky.\n8. Place the ears into a labeled 12-well flat-bottom plate. Fill each of the wells with 1 ml fresh fixing solution. Leave the plates on a shaker for 0.5-1 hr at room temperature.\n9. Add 1× DPBS to a 100-mm culture dish. Temporarily transfer one ear at a time to this 100-mm dish, place under dissection microscope, and zoom in on the cut edge of the ear. Separate the front and back sides of the ear by gripping each side at the cut edge with fine forceps and then slowly pulling them apart. Keep track of which side is the epithelial side and which is the side with interstitial tissue/endothelium.\n10. Making sure the interstitial tissue/endothelium side of the ear is facing down, place each ear half individually in a 12-well plate with fresh fixing solution. Leave the plate on a shaker overnight at 4°C.\nThe epithelial (outer) side is hydrophobic/waxy, so the ear halves may float with the interstitial above the fixative if not placed interstitial side down.\nDay 2\n11. Wash ears with 1× DPBS three times, 10 min each, at room temperature.",
    "12. Place each half-ear in the same orientation as before into a well of a 24-well plate with 500 ml permeabilization buffer in each well. Leave to permeabilize on a shaker overnight at 4°C.\nDay 3\n13. Wash ears with 1× DPBS three times, 10 min each, at room temperature.\n14. Dilute anti-PECAM 2H8 and anti-S100A9 in a solution of 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) + 5% normal goat serum (NGS). Add 250 ml antibody mixture into each well of a 24-well plate. Place each half-ear in the same orientation as before in the wells. Leave the plate on a shaker overnight at 4°C.\nRecommended concentrations are 9 μg/ml anti-PECAM and 2 μg/ml anti-S100A9, which corresponds to dilutions of 1:200 for anti-PECAM 2H8 and 1:500 for anti-S100A9 from the commercial sources stated in the Materials list.\nDay 4\n15. Wash ears with 1× DPBS three times, 10 min each, at room temperature.\n16. Dilute goat anti-Armenian hamster secondary and goat anti-rat secondary in a solution of 2.5% BSA + 5% NGS + 5% normal mouse serum. Leave this mixture for 15 min on ice to preabsorb the secondary antibodies. Add 250 ml of the mixture into each well of a 24-well plate. Place each half-ear in the same orientation as before in the wells. Cover the plate with aluminum foil to protect the fluorophores from light. Leave the plate on a shaker for 4 hr at room temperature.\n17. Wash ears with 1× DPBS three times, 10 min each, at room temperature.",
    "18. Mount specimens on glass microscope slides. Place two drops of FluorSave mounting reagent onto the slide, and place the half-ear onto the slide with the epithelial side facing down. Add as many drops of FluorSave as needed and place coverslip on top. Allow slides to dry in a dark place for at least 1 hr at room temperature.\nPlace the coverslip delicately so that as few bubbles as possible get trapped. Depending on the shape of the half-ears, they might need to be trimmed so that they can lie flat on the slide. It is recommended to use a generous amount of FluorSave reagent, because it has a tendency to shrink when dry.\n19. Store slides in a slide holder to maintain them protected from light and store at 4°C until imaging.\nSlides can be stored for several months without significantly decreasing the quality of the images, but it is still advisable to image them soon after mounting.\nImaging\n20. Turn on the spinning-disk confocal microscope. Place the slide on the mechanical stage and add a drop of immersion oil on top of the coverslips. Adjust the position of the slide so that the objective lens (40× oil) is directly above the ear that received carrier mixture. Lower the objective until it barely touches the drop of oil.\nBecause this protocol uses fixed samples for imaging, a laser-scanning confocal microscope can be used in place of the spinning-disk confocal.\n21. Focus the image until the blood vessels are visible in the goat anti-Armenian hamster secondary channel.\n22. Switch to the goat anti-rat secondary channel, and scan to verify that there are few to no leukocytes (0-2 per field).",
    "The ears that received carrier mixture should not show any inflammation; otherwise they cannot serve as control conditions for the ears on which acute inflammation was triggered using the croton oil mixture.\n23. Adjust the position of the slide so that the objective lens is directly above the ear that received croton oil mixture. Lower the objective and focus the image as in step 20.\n24. Scan the sample for blood vessels whose cell-to-cell junctions have a cobblestone pattern, and that have a diameter between 15 μm and 50 μm, ideally between 30 μm and 50 μm.\nThese are most likely to be post-capillary venules, where neutrophils extravasate. Avoid vessels with highly elongated, thin endothelial cells because these are likely to be arteries.\n25. Switch the laser to the goat anti-rat secondary channel. Take a z stack if there are 10-30 leukocytes in the field.\n26. Repeat steps 24 and 25 for 10 or more fields in each ear that received the croton oil mixture.\n27. Repeat entire imaging process for all the experimental conditions.\nCounting of leukocytes\n28. On each picture, look at the z plane and score how many leukocytes are inside and outside the vessels (area within 50 mm from a venule). If there are leukocytes that are neither fully inside nor outside, count them separately.\nAs much as possible, avoid counting leukocytes inside the vessels that are not in contact with the walls of the vessels. Avoid counting leukocytes that are outside vessels and have a low amount of fluorescence because these are likely to be resident macrophages.\n29. Calculate the percent TEM per image: Divide the number of leukocytes that were outside the vessels by the total amount of leukocytes in the given image. Repeat this for all images.",
    "30. Calculate the average percent TEM: Take the average of the values from step 29. Compare the average percent TEM between/among experimental conditions and perform statistical tests as needed.\nIf the average percent TEM in an experimental condition is lower than that in the control condition, it means that TEM was blocked to a given extent by the condition the mouse was exposed to.",
    "If the mice used in the experiment have fluorescent neutrophils (e.g., LysM-eGFP, Catchup), it is possible to skip the steps of the protocol that involve staining leukocytes with antibodies after fixation.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-prot-0001])\nMice with fluorescent neutrophils (e.g., LysM-eGFP, Catchup)\nNon-blocking CD31 (PECAM) monoclonal antibody (390) conjugated with fluorophore of choice\nDay 1\nPerform Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-prot-0001], steps 1-10, but between steps 5 and 6 in the original protocol, perform the following steps, if applicable.\n1. Anesthetize the mice as in step 2.\n2. Take one mouse and inject 100 μl fluorescent 390 antibody retro-orbitally. Wait 5 min.\nThe recommended concentration is 0.25 mg/ml. As this will label endothelial cells, the steps can be omitted if the mouse has been genetically engineered with a fluorescent endothelial cell marker.\n3. Skip the steps for Day 2 and 3 (steps 11-14), and continue Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-prot-0001] from Day 4 (step 15) onward.",
    "The cremaster muscle is an extremely thin, muscular sheath that surrounds the testes in male mice. This protocol describes methods to surgically expose, mount, and image the vasculature of the cremaster muscle to study the infiltration of inflammatory cells in vivo in real time. IVM of the cremaster muscle is used to visualize the movement of inflammatory cells like leukocytes. This protocol is useful for visualizing the response to localized inflammatory stimuli. IL-1β is routinely used as a generic stimulus, particularly when studying general leukocyte adhesion and diapedesis. Other inflammatory stimuli could be used to interrogate specific leukocyte subsets and/or other components of the inflammatory cascade.\nMaterials\n1× DPBS without calcium and magnesium (Corning, product no. 21-031-CV)\nRecombinant mouse interleukin-1β (IL-1β; R&D Systems, 401-ML-005/CF)\nMice with genetically encoded fluorescent leukocytes, wild-type or knockouts, with or without prior treatment of interest (see paragraph on Fluorescent Mice in the Critical Parameters section below)\nKetamine hydrochloride (Covetrus, NDC no. 11695-0703-1)\nXylazine (Akorn Inc., NDC no. 59399-110-20)\nAnti-PECAM antibody conjugated to a fluorophore (EMD Millipore, CBL1337 clone 390, rat anti-mouse, non-blocking)\nNairTM hair-removal lotion\nPerfusion buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0009])\nPlexiglas platform with glass window\nHeating pad\nSutures\nThreaded needle\nModeling clay\nSilicone stage with quartz pedestal\nDissecting microscope (Leica or equivalent)\nSuture needles bent into an “L” shape\nFine forceps and scissors\nDissecting pins\nBuffer warmer\nCotton tip applicators\nSyringe pump\nConfocal microscope (Nikon or equivalent) with 20× water-immersion objective\n1.

A noticeable bulge from the volume injected usually indicates correct injection depth. After injection, palpate the scrotum with the plunger end of the syringe to gently distribute the inflammatory stimulus.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1c922040-a3bb-46a7-8836-bd0b362ed74a/cpz1739-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

Wait 3.5 hr.\nExact timing depends on several factors, including the cell type/process to be examined and the skill of the surgeon.

The total area of exposed skin should be 1 cm × 1 cm.\n6. Secure the mouse in a supine position on a Plexiglas platform containing an internal heating pad set to ∼37°C. Use suture to securely tie the urethra to prevent urination during the procedure. Tape each lower leg such that it straddles the edge of a glass window in the platform (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0002] and D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0002]).\n7.

Secure the tissue across the quartz pedestal using bent suture needle(s) (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0003]).\n11. Begin perfusion with warmed perfusion buffer. Allow buffer to drain directly onto the objective by bringing the perfusion tube directly next to it. The buffer can then drain down onto the tissue in a way that does not induce motion artifacts throughout the rest of the protocol. Using a syringe pump helps provide for a smooth, steady flow and is preferable to a peristaltic pump.\n12. Carefully remove connective tissue from the cremaster muscle using forceps by grabbing small pieces of the overlying sheath and pull them down and away from the body.\n13. Open the muscle using microsurgery scissors by making a single distal-to-proximal incision that avoids severing as many large vessels as possible.\nThe bleeding from small vessels will clot naturally; large vessels are closed either by pinching the vessel near the opening with fine forceps or pinning the vessel to the silicone pedestal.\n14. Cut the small tissue connection and vessel running from the epididymis (and associated testicle) to the cremaster muscle using microsurgery scissors and replace them in the inguinal canal (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0004]).\nIn some mice, a large vessel connects these organs to the muscle. In these mice, this vessel and tissues should be left connected but secured out of the viewing field to avoid dramatic tissue damage and blood flow anomalies.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/23c01ca6-b91e-4452-b01a-1a19c058d1b6/cpz1739-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

Spread the muscle across the silicone stage centered over the quartz pedestal and pin it along its periphery (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0004]).\n16. Transfer the platform and secured mouse to the microscope for visualization (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0004] and D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0004]).\n17. Identify target fields containing post-capillary venules that have normal flow using bright-field illumination.\nIdeal fields are those containing a relatively straight 30-50 µm post-capillary venule with robust, steady flow that does not pause or slow. Ideal vessels (under control conditions) will likely have rolling leukocytes and some arrested leukocytes. There should be several suitable fields available; representative regions are best identified by scanning several regions of the tissue. Vessels closer to the surface will provide higher-quality images.\n18. Record desired image sequences.\nImage acquisition\n19. Collect the following image series as needed for the experiment:\n         \nIn bright-field, acquire one plane for 1 min at maximum speed to confirm flow.\nIn fluorescence, acquire a z stack through the entire field with a 1-µm step size to document the entire field.\nUnlike for z stacks of fixed objects, where the entire stack is first acquired in one color, then a second stack in a second color, etc., to best visualize the temporal and spatial relationships of cells to vessels, it is best to take an image in each color at each z plane. This results in slower acquisition of the entire stack, but truer anatomic relationships.",
    "20. Turn the contrast settings up while shortening the acquisition time to the shortest reasonable time (60-80 ms works well). Find a viewing plane with the vessel both centered on your screen and near the top of the viewing plane where adherent leukocytes can be seen. Record one plane in the leukocyte channel at maximum speed for 1 min to document rolling flux and adhesion.\nTurning up the contrast settings will cause the cells in the focal plane to be saturated. However, doing so allows the visualization of many more cells outside the focal plane. Additionally, these shifted settings can allow acquisition and counting of nonadherent cells passing in the bloodstream.\n21. Restore the settings back to those reasonable for long-term acquisition. Ideal settings will minimize both intensity and exposure time, which will help reduce photobleaching while allowing a maximum acquisition rate (frames per minute).\n22. Define the upper and lower boundaries for the vessel that is to be imaged longitudinally.\nMost of the TEM observed occurs on the sides of the vessel, so be sure to include those regions within the z boundaries. Try to adjust the settings (exposure time, number of channels, number of z planes) so that an entire stack can be acquired in ≤15 s, which permits a frame rate of 4 per second. If the timing allows, it is often beneficial to image more planes in the z direction so that the entirety of the vessel will still be captured even if there are subtle movements of the vessel over time.\n23. Check the mouse to determine if it needs a booster dose of anesthesia and administer if necessary.\n24. Check perfusion buffer to make sure there is enough to complete the recording (typically 15 min).",
    "25. Begin the longitudinal acquisition. Monitor the images in real time in order to adjust the focal plane as needed so that the desired vessel is always collected. Example acquisition of transendothelial migration in the cremaster is shown in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0005].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/627a6ce1-c4a2-4d99-87eb-b30f193027ac/cpz1739-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nExample image of intravital microscopy of the inflamed cremaster muscle. Endothelial cell junctions labeled by PECAM (green) with red neutrophils and blue calcium signaling. Scale bars are 50 µm.\n26. In fluorescence, acquire a z stack through the entire field with a 1-µm step size to document the entire field at the end of the imaging.\n27. After recording, examine the field again using bright-field illumination and acquire one plane for 1 min at maximum speed to check for any undesired changes in flow rate.\nDo not score any field in which the flow has slowed dramatically or is stopped.\n28. If desired, find another field and repeat these steps.\n29. Sacrifice the mouse after the last images have been acquired.\nImage analysis\n30. Open the image in the desired image analysis program.\n31. Confirm that the scale and time has been transferred or retained faithfully.\n32. Adherent cells may be counted by examining individual leukocytes along the vessel and assessing their movement over the 60-s recording. Adherent cells are defined as remaining attached and moving less than one cell diameter over 30 s. Vessel walls may be confirmed and measured with the thick stack acquired above. The vessel length is measured along the middle and average diameter is averaged from multiple measurements along the length. Surface area (SA) can by calculated by modeling the vessel as half a cylinder with the equation SA = πrl + πr2, where l is the length and r is the average radius.",
    "The equation is for half a cylinder because the blood flow typically obscures the lower side of the vessel, making it impossible to gather data from half of the venule.\n33. Determine the rolling flux by identifying a position in the vessel where rolling and free-flowing leukocytes can be easily seen both in and out of focus, and count the number of leukocytes that roll past that point over the recording. Data are expressed either as number of rollers (past this point) per second or per minute.\n34. Calculate rolling flux fraction by counting the number of leukocytes that pass the same point in the blood stream. Leukocytes in the blood stream will appear as streaks and should be able to be tracked in sequential frames.\nIt may not be possible to do this calculation in vessels with fast flow as it requires the confident identification of free-flowing cells in multiple frames. Likewise, if the leukocyte marker is not bright enough, free-flowing cells may not be detected with high enough confidence to make an accurate calculation. To acquire images more rapidly and capture free-flowing leukocytes in a fast stream, try decreasing the exposure time and increasing the laser/light power and artificial signal enhancements (i.e., sensitivity and gain). Also, smaller venules usually have slower blood flow, so consider changing fields.\n35. Quantify transendothelial migration from the long recording by tracking individual cells as the move over time. Typically, cells will adhere and/or roll into the view and spend a few minutes crawling around, usually along endothelial junctions (identified by staining with the anti-PECAM 390 antibody). When they undergo TEM, they will stop moving and “ball up.” Shortly thereafter, they will be observed dramatically flattened and on the outside of the vessel.",
    "This entire step is often quite quick and may only appear in two or three frames. Thus, one can infer transendothelial migration by the simultaneous change in morphology and position. Depending on the location on the vessel, this step may correspond to a detectable hole in the PECAM junctional staining. This pore is usually more noticeable (i.e., more easily resolved) when the event occurs at or near the top of the vessel. Lower z-axis resolution often obscures clear pore formation. After flattening on the outside of the vessel, the leukocyte will often linger for several minutes before detaching and migrating several microns away from the vessel.",
    "The cremaster muscle is uniquely useful for imaging inflammation and extravasation from systemic vasculature due to its thin, vascularized structure. To effectively image this membranous muscle with confocal and/or bright-field microscopy, the muscle must be exteriorized onto an imaging stage that is conducive to microscopy and capable of keeping the structure exposed and still. The use of a quartz viewing stage surrounded by silicone allows the tacking of the cremaster muscle and exposure of vasculature of interest.

    "Wide-field imaging allows the rapid acquisition of images over an entire field. Unlike confocal imaging, wide-field imaging has limited resolution in the z dimension, making it difficult to delineate whether a particular leukocyte has extravasated outside of a vessel. However, in contrast to confocal imaging, wide-field imaging allows the visualization of global leukocyte migration patterns. In this protocol, wide-field microscopy is used to visualize leukocytes in relation to the vasculature across an entire fluorescently labeled brain slice. This protocol includes advice on how to remove the brain and image with wide-field microscopy to quantify leukocyte extravasation.

    "Imaging the vasculature of the lungs can be challenging because of the dense capillary network surrounding the alveolar sacs of the lungs. The vasculature of the lungs is unique compared to that of any other tissue, and inflammation in the lungs underlies many pathologies. These methods are used for imaging inflammation in the lungs after induction of injury or at baseline physiological conditions. These protocols can be used to prepare lungs to image leukocyte extravasation by wide-field microscopy or any type of fluorescence microscopy. Here we provide an outline of how to image inflammation in the murine lung. This protocol includes two experimental techniques for inflating the lungs. One protocol involves inflation via tracheostomy, whereas the other utilizes a long, blunted gavage needle to inflate the lungs. The experimenter can choose whichever method they feel most comfortable executing, as the end result will be identical. Figure 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0008] show a general workflow for imaging the lungs ex vivo, the details of which are described below.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/33c7880a-9c19-4d16-8700-14d6b209fdf3/cpz1739-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nStandard workflow for lung removal and imaging.\nMaterials\nOptional: Labeling antibodies (e.g., 390 to label endothelial cell junctions)\nAvertin (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0001])\n70% ethanol\n4% paraformaldehyde fixing solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0011])\n1× DPBS, without calcium and magnesium (Corning, product no. 21-031-CV)\nOCT Compound (Sakura, cat. no. 4583)\nDissecting board\nDissecting tools\nDissecting board pins\nBlunt forceps\nBlunt-tipped scissors\nSutures\nSharp scissors\nLuer stubs (Instech Labs, cat. no.

    "1. Induce inflammation or perform the procedure necessitated by the experiment along with any appropriate controls.\n2. Prior to euthanasia, inject any needed live antibody labels. Make sure that these are fixable.\nTypically, 30 min before euthanasia, we label PECAM-1 with non-blocking 390 antibody and 2,000,000MW dextran.\n3. Inject the mouse with an overdose injection of Avertin (800 µl-1 ml of Avertin, prepared as noted previously) to achieve deep anesthesia.\nThis can be performed by any IACUC accepted procedure; however, because many means of anesthesia are inhaled, you must be mindful of potential for your method to cause further damage/inflammation in the lungs.\n4. Once the mouse is in a deep plane of anesthesia (unresponsive to toe pinch), you can proceed with the lung removal.\n5. To remove the lungs, place the mouse flat on a dissecting board on its back, pinning all four limbs to the board using pins.\n6. Use 70% ethanol to wet the hair on the top of the mouse, focusing on the abdomen and the head. This is not to sanitize or clean the mouse but rather for fur control (to avoid getting fur in the sample).\n7. Gross-dissect the skin away from the abdomen by gently pulling up on the skin on the abdomen with blunt forceps and making a small incision with blunt-tipped scissors. Insert the scissors in the cut, below the skin but above the chest plate. Open and close the scissors, gently moving them up the abdomen until you have bluntly dissected the skin away from the chest plate up to the jaw.\n8. Using the blunt-tipped scissors, cut away the loose skin covering the chest and bottom of the jaw.",
    "9. Underneath the jaw of the mouse, there will be two pieces of white-pink tissue (salivary glands). Pull these two apart or remove them completely, exposing the trachea.\n10. Remove the chest wall by cutting away the diaphragm and up the left and right side of the ribs. This will expose the lungs.\n11. Carefully dissect away the protective tissue around the trachea, exposing the horizontal rings of cartilage. You should dissect away the tissue both ventrally and dorsally.\n12. Thread a 10-cm piece of suture under the trachea, leaving equal visible trachea space above and below the suture.\n13. Using small, sharp scissors, make a small (∼1 mm) cut in between the rings of cartilage of the trachea.\nTo make this easier, you can gently tug up on the suture, pulling up and exposing more of the trachea from the body. However, you want the trachea to remain in one piece connected to the lungs.\n14. Insert the Luer stub into the incision, and tightly tie the suture around the Luer stub and trachea with a single square knot that can be undone.\n15. Slowly instill the lung with up to 700 µl of 4% paraformaldehyde fixative using a 1-ml slip-tip syringe.\nThe volume of murine lungs is ∼1 ml, depending on the size of the mouse. You want to inflate the lungs to retain the integrity of the alveolar structure, but not overinflate them.\n16. Remove the syringe and Luer stub while simultaneously tightening the suture to keep the fixative inside the lungs. Tie off the suture with a box knot.\n17. Holding the trachea up with the suture (gently pulling away from the body), cut at the top of the trachea, then dissect the lungs and heart away from the body.",
    "18. Remove the lungs/heart together with the suture. Place in a container filled with fixative.\n19. At this point, you can either quick-fix or fully fix. If you are quick-fixing, leave the lungs in the fixative for 30 min and then move on to imaging. If you are fully fixing, leave the lungs in fixative overnight. The next day, transfer the lung to 15% sucrose in PBS. Once the lungs have sunk to the bottom in the 15% sucrose (usually 1-2 days), transfer them to 30% sucrose until they sink (1-2 days).\n20. Once the lungs are ready for imaging, you can image whole lungs, thick sections, or thin sections. You can also split the lungs up into left and right lungs or individual lobes for different imaging methods.\nFor confocal imaging, we typically use whole lung lobes. For wide-field or epifluorescence imaging, we typically use thick or thin sections.\nFor whole lung imaging\n21a. Remove the lungs from the fixative. Dissect away any blood clots or excess tissue from the outside of the lungs.\n22a. Using sharp scissors, cut off the whole lobe that you plan to image.\nBe careful to not cause any trauma on the outside of the lungs. This can be ensured by holding the heart, rather than the lung itself, with forceps.\n23a. Under the dissecting microscope, pop any surface bubbles and clear the top of the lobe of blood and tissue as much as possible.\nBubbles will continue to rise to the surface as a result of the physiology of the lung; just do your best to pop surface bubbles.\n24a. Place the lobe, viewing side down, in a MatTek dish. Hydrate with DPBS and place a cover slip on top.\n25a. The lung is now prepared for imaging. Proceed to step 27.",
    "For thick sectioning\n21b. Remove the lungs from the fixative. Dissect away any blood clots or excess tissue from the outside of the lungs.\n22b. Using sharp scissors, cut off the whole lobe that you plan to image.\n23b. Place the lobe in a Tissue-Tek Cryomold and either quick or slow freeze the lobe. To quick-freeze the lobe, place the cryomold on dry ice (5-10 min). To slowly freeze the lobe, place the cryomold in a −20°C freezer until frozen (30-60 min).\n24b. Remove the lobe and section in 1-mm slices with a razor blade. This can be done by eye or in a brain matrix for sectioning.\nUsing a brain matrix works best on the left lobe of the mouse.\n25b. Place the section in a MatTek dish in 3-4 drops of PBS. Under dissecting microscope, pop any surface bubbles and place a cover slip on top.\n26b. The lung is now prepared for imaging. Continue with step 27.\nFor thin sectioning\n27. Remove the lungs from fixative. Dissect away any blood clots or excess tissue from the outside of the lungs.\n28. Using sharp scissors, cut off the whole lobe that you plan to image.\n29. Place a dot of OCT compound in a 15 × 15 × 5-mm Tissue-Tek Cryomold. Wait until the OCT has settled at the bottom and all bubbles have popped. The OCT should fully coat the bottom of the cryomold.\n30. Place the lung lobe you plan to image on the OCT in the cryomold. Cover the lung with more OCT until it is fully submerged. Allow the OCT to settle and all the bubbles to pop (2-3 min).\n31. Place the cryomold on dry ice.",
    "32. Once frozen, remove the frozen block from the mold and place inside a cryostat set to 18°C.\n33. With a razor blade, cut off the edges of the OCT that do not contain lung tissue.\n34. Using the cryostat, section the lung tissue into 10-15 µm sections and place on a slide. Keep the slides uncovered on dry ice.\n35. Rinse the OCT off by placing 2-3 drops of PBS on the slide for 5 min before placing a cover slip on the slide.361. Image the slides.\nCounting cells in FIJI\n36. Import your image into FIJI using the BioFormats importer.\nIf this has not been previously installed, go to Downloads, Show Contents, and paste BioFormats into the plugin folder.\n37. Split any color channels into their own separate image tabs by going to Image, Color, Split Channels.\n38. For each color channel with cells, perform background subtraction based on pixel size. Select Process, Subtract Background, and input the approximate pixel size of the cell type for the background subtraction.\nPixel size will differ based on the magnification, cell type, and/or microscope. Utilize scale bars based on the microscope/objective you are using to estimate pixel size.\n39. To count the cells in a given channel, convert the channel to a binary. Select Process, Binary, Make Binary. Select Analyze, Analyze Particles…, and input your criteria. The Analyze Particles function can discriminate on the basis of size and circularity. This will differ depending on your cell type (Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0009]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/84d690c1-7c09-430b-a4df-ab52527d6125/cpz1739-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nAutomated counting of neutrophils using particle analysis in FIJI.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9ae5ee7c-46f0-4fea-b235-0fdce83fd0ae/cpz1739-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\nInflammation in the lungs.

    "The gavage device is reusable and runs less risk of fully tearing the trachea and being unable to tie the suture. This alternative protocol may also be easier for someone newer to the technique.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-prot-0006])\nStraight stainless steel olive tip cannula with Luer-Lok base\nPerform Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-prot-0006], replacing steps 12-16 with the following.\n12a. Attach a straight stainless steel olive tip cannula with a Luer-Lok base to a 1-5 ml syringe containing fixative.\nThese cannulas are available from a number of medical supply companies in a variety of gauges. Select one with a tip diameter appropriate for the size of the mice you will use to avoid overstretching the trachea.\n13a. Gently insert the cannula through the oropharynx into the trachea. It is helpful to pull up on the mouse's lower jaw with forceps to help guide it. The trachea is anterior to the esophagus, so guide the cannula, pushing it slightly anteriorly and caudally to avoid insertion into the esophagus.\n14a. You will see the tip of the cannula enter the trachea through the cartilage rings. When it is more than halfway to the lungs, thread a piece of suture behind the esophagus and tie the first half of a square knot around the trachea, holding the cannula in place.\nThe membrane on the posterior side of the trachea has no cartilage and is very thin and delicate, so it is better not to try to dissect it away from the esophagus. The esophagus can always be dissected off the specimen later, if necessary, and this will be easier to accomplish once the tissues are fixed.\n15a. Slowly instill the lung with up to 700 µl of 4% paraformaldehyde fixative using a 1-ml slip-tip syringe.",

    "The objective of Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-prot-0008] is to induce, image, and quantify leukocyte extravasation from vasculature in the mouse retina. The eye is an immune-privileged organ and has few leukocytes at baseline; thus, to visualize leukocyte infiltration, the experimenter will need to use a stimulus to induce inflammation in the eye. This can be done by intravitreal injection of an inflammatory stimulus prior to sacrifice. The experimenter then conducts immunofluorescence staining on whole-mount retina and acquires fluorescent images to visualize the leukocytes and retina vasculature. The experimenter can use FIJI to process the immunofluorescence images and quantify leukocyte extravasation. If the protocol is conducted properly, the experimenter will induce inflammation, visualize, and quantify leukocyte infiltration in the mouse retina.\nMaterials\nMice of interest: e.g., C57BL/6 or Ccr2RFPCx3cr1GFP mice\nKetamine/xylazine anesthetic (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0002])\nMeloxicam\n1× DPBS without calcium and magnesium (Corning, product no. 21-031-CV)\nProparacaine hydrochloride eye drops\nPhenylephrine hydrochloride eye drops\nTropicamide eyedrops\n4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixing solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0011])\nBlocking solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0010])\nWashing solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-rec-0006])\nRecombinant Mouse CCL2/JE/MCP-1 Protein (R&D Systems Inc., cat. no. 479-JE-050/CF)\nPrimary antibody, such as:\n               \nRabbit Anti-S100A9 antibody [2B10] (Abcam, ab105472) to detect neutrophils\nRabbit Anti-IBA1 antibody (Wako, 019-19741) to detect macrophages\nGoat Anti-Collagen IV antibody (Abcam, ab19808) to detect vessels\nGoat Anti-CD31 antibody (R&D Systems, AF3628) to detect vessels\nSecondary antibody, such as:\n               \nAffiniPure Goat Anti-Rat IgG (Jackson, cat. no. 112-005-167)\nAlexa Fluor® 647 AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Jackson, cat. no. 111-605-144)\nProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher, cat. no.

Continue tearing at different parts of the globe until the cup is easily separable from the retina.\nBe careful not to pinch or touch the retina at any point, as it is very fragile tissue.\n25. Pinch the retina at the optic nerve to separate it from the cup.\nImmunofluorescence staining of whole-mount retina\nDay 1\n26. Place dissected retinas immediately into 4% PFA and fix for 1 hr at room temperature.\n27. Manually aspirate PFA with a transfer pipet and wash retina with washing solution (PBS + 0.1% Tween) for 10 min on an orbital shaker at room temperature. Repeat this step 4 times.\nManual aspiration is preferred to vacuum aspiration to prevent accidental aspiration of retina.\n28. Block retinas by submerging in blocking solution overnight at 4°C or for 1 hr at room temperature on an orbital shaker.\nDay 2\n29. Move retinas to a 24-well plate and incubate in primary antibodies overnight at 4°C on an orbital shaker.\nDay 3",
    "30. Move retinas back to the 12-well plate and wash with washing buffer for 10 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Repeat four times.\n31. Move retinas back to 24-well plate and add secondary antibody in blocking solution for 1 hr at room temperature on an orbital shaker.\n32. Move retinas back to the 12-well plate and wash with washing buffer for 10 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Repeat four times.\nMounting retina onto microscope glass slide\nDay 3 continued\n33. Using a transfer pipet, place stained retina into 1× DPBS in a plastic weigh boat or similar-sized vessel under a dissecting light microscope.\nMoving the retina with forceps can create tears in the tissue. Instead of using forceps, cut the tip of a transfer pipet at an angle such that the opening is larger than the retina. Move the retina with suction, as suctioning the retina with a transfer pipet should not damage the tissue.\n34. Cut retina into four leaflets using cuts at 90° (Fig. 13[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.739#cpz1739-fig-0013]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/986502d1-3b68-4b86-a26c-5ef9c803df4e/cpz1739-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13\nSchematic diagram showing a retina cup being cut at 90° into a flattened retina with four leaflets. Created with BioRender (biorender.com).\n35. Place retina onto a glass microscope slide using a transfer pipet.\n36. Wick away DPBS with a Kimwipe, and flatten the retina by maneuvering the leaflets with straight forceps.\n37. Place 1-2 drops of ProLong Gold on retina and cover with a coverslip. Seal coverslip with nail polish and allow it to cure at 4°C overnight or until ready to image.\nImage acquisition\nAcquire fluorescence images of stained retina as desired. Confocal images are necessary to investigate the superficial and deep capillary plexuses independently. For quantification in FIJI, it is advisable to acquire images that encompass the entire retina.",
    "Quantification of leukocytes with FIJI\n38. Open .nd2 file in FIJI.\n39. Use horizontal scroll bar to scroll to the channel of interest in the .nd2 file.\n40. Adjust the brightness/contrast settings until your cells of interest are clear. To do this, go to Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast > Auto. If the “auto” option does not work well, you can manually adjust the settings in the pop-up window.\nDo not hit apply. As long as you do not hit “Apply,” you are only changing the way the data look and not the data themselves.\n41. Next, duplicate your image, as it is good practice to work on duplicates and not the original file. To do this, go to Image > Duplicate > Unclick “Duplicate hyperstack” and type in the number of the channel you want to duplicate (i.e., 1, 2, or 3). Duplicate your channel of interest twice. One duplicate will be your “original” and the other will be for “thresholding.”\n“Threshold” duplicate\n42. In your “threshold” duplicate, choose a threshold strategy for your image that highlights your cells of interest. To do this, go to Image > Adjust > Threshold. Make sure “dark background” is ticked and “B&W” is selected under the second drop-down menu. In the first drop-down menu, scroll through the different threshold options until you see one that automatically highlights your cells of interest. Click “Apply” and close the window.\nIt is OK if debris in the retina is also highlighted, as debris will be removed in the next step. It is most important to ensure that the thresholding option you choose highlights the leukocytes/cells of interest.\n43. Next, segment out debris. Go to Analyze > Analyze Particles > 300-infinity. Make sure “add manager” is ticked in the ROI pop-up window.",
    "The goal of this step is to segment out areas of your image that you do not want FIJI to register as cells. You can change the 300 to any particle size. This segmentation tells FIJI that you want to highlight anything greater than 300 μm2 (or the size you choose).\n“Original” duplicate\n44. Now we will overlay the debris selections from step 43 over your “original” duplicate. Go to your “original” duplicate, and click “show all” in the ROI manager until you see your debris selection on your original image. Click “More” in the ROI manager > Fill.\nThis will “fill” the debris of your retina with a color and remove those data so that FIJI will not register them when you count cells later. Select the fill color in the color selector in the FIJI toolbar. You can choose whichever color you wish. In the ROI manager, More > Fill to fill in the color you chose. The resulting image is the image you want to analyze.\n45. Next, measure the total area of the debris selections, as you will need to subtract this area from your selection of the whole retina later to calculate a “total retina area” in which to count cells. The ROI manager contains a list of selections that correspond to the segmented debris. Select all points in the ROI manager, and then Analyze > Measure in the menu at the top of your screen. The output is the area (μm2) of the debris. Write this number down.\nYou can save selections in the ROI manager by clicking More > Save.\nTo ensure that “area” is the output that is measured, go to Analyze > Set measurements and make sure “area” is selected.",
    "46. Next, measure the area of retina to be analyzed. This will require you to calculate the area of the entire retina (including the debris). Go to your “original” duplicate that now has the debris filled out, select the “polygon” selection tool in the FIJI toolbar, and manually outline the entire retina. By hand drawing, you can get a count of “cells per area” and compare this in a standardized way. Once you have made your selection, go to your ROI manager and click “Add” to add your selection to the manager. In the manager, click on the selection you just added, and Analyze > Measure to calculate the area of your selection in μm2. Note that this is not the final area. To find the total area of retina to count cells in, subtract “debris area” from the area you just measured. Write this number down.\nAfter making your selection, make sure you do not click anywhere else in the image because that will deselect your selection. If this happens, go to Edit > Selection > Restore Selection. Note that this will only restore your most recent selection.\nTo save your selection, go to Analyze > Tools > ROI manager > More > Save\nTo open or load your selection, go to Analyze > Tools > ROI manager > More > Open",
    "47. Next, find and calculate the number of leukocytes in the retina. To do this, you must tell FIJI what you consider to be a leukocyte. While making sure the retina area you selected is still highlighted, zoom in to your tissue and click the “hand/scrolling tool” button in the FIJI toolbar to move to an area of the retina with leukocytes. Go to Process > Find maxima in the menu at the top of the screen. The number of maxima is your leukocyte count.\nMake sure “preview point selection” is ticked. The bigger the prominence, the fewer points you will have. Make sure you zoom into the tissue far enough to see differences in points selected based on how you change your prominence (i.e., when you increase or decrease prominence). Your tissue area selected may deselect during this process, so make sure you have saved your selection area per step 46 so that you can reload it.\n48. Finally, quantify the number of leukocytes per retina by dividing your maxima calculated in step 47 by the final retina area calculated in step 46. This will give you the number of leukocytes per μm2 of retina."
