    "1. Creation of molds used for patterning\nConceptual design of patterns.  Patterns are created which serve to form cell networks, control cell contact, isolate cells, mimic natural structures, or otherwise guide cell adhesion and placement.\nComputer-aided design or CAD based creation of pattern and creation of photomask.  The desired pattern is designed in CAD software, such as AutoCAD, and is then sent to an outside company for producing a photomask.\nPhotolithography to produce master pattern.  Glass slides are patterned with either a thin positive resist or a thick negative resist depending upon the size of the structure being created.  Glass slides are used for their benefits of being low cost, stronger than silicon wafers and not producing as much dust when broken.  Alternatively, other convenient structures such as diffraction gratings can be used as the master pattern.\n The patterned slide is attached to a stack of slides which have not been patterned.  All steps are performed inside a clean flow hood to minimize dust.\nCreation of master molds.  A container of tinfoil slightly larger than the stack of slides is created to hold the 30 g of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which is then poured over the photolithographically patterned surface to create an initial mold.  The PDMS is degassed and allowed to cure for one to two days.\nOnce cured the PDMS is peeled off of the master pattern and forms a mold for the next step.",
    "6 g of 2 part epoxy ( Devcon #14310(6 g) is mixed for 1 minute and then poured into the master mold, degassed and allowed to cure.  Degassing the epoxy must be done quickly (<8 min) using many bubble breaking cycles and using only a thin layer before it the epoxy sets and bubble removal becomes impossible to remove the bubbles.  The 6 g used produces a thin layer which facilitates quick bubble removal.\n After one hour, the 2 part epoxy will be partially cured and more epoxy can be added on top without degassing to produce a thicker structure which is easer to handle in later steps.  The epoxy is then allowed to cure for one to two days.\nOnce cured, the epoxy is removed from the PDMS master mold and tape is wrapped around the epoxy mold to form a container.  A working mold is then created by pouring PDMS onto the epoxy mold, degassing the PDMS, and curing for one to two days.\n Once cured, the working mold is peeled off of the epoxy and stored to maintain cleanliness.\n2. Patterning of surfaces with molds for cell guidance\nSmall sections of the working mold are cut out and placed onto a polystyrene Petri dish.  The locations of these mold sections are labeled.\nA tripod is formed from the small sections and weighted to ensure conformal contact between the working mold and the Petri dish surface.  Good placement can be observed by looking at the bottom of the dish.\nThe assembly is placed into the plasma chamber.  Plasma treatment is initiated and continued at 150 Pa at 29.6 W (max power) for 10 minutes using air plasma.\n After plasma treatment, the mold and weight arraignment are removed.",
    "The Petri dish is placed under UV light for 10 minutes of sterilization inside the biosafety cabinet and stored there until seeded with cells.\n3. Seeding surfaces with cells\nSH-SY5Y CRL-2266 Human Neuroblastoma or other cells are cultured using standard protocols for the cell type.\nThe confluence of the SH-SY5Y CRL-2266 Human Neuroblastoma cells is measured visually before seeding onto the patterned surface.\nStandard cell splitting is carried out to remove the cells from the surface of their Petri dish.\nThe cells, once free floating, are seeded onto the surface of the patterned Petri dish after being diluted to achieve the desired confluence when placed on the patterned surface.\nThe cells are allowed to settle and attach to the surface.\nThe patterned Petri dish is incubated for several hours to several days while the cells assemble onto the pattern created by the plasma.\nWhen culturing the neuroblastoma cells, retinoic acid (10 μM) is added daily in order to induce the cells to differentiate into a neuron-like state.  The addition of the retinoic acid is done in the dark.\nRetinoic acid is added daily for several days, after which differentiation will be observable.\nMedia is replaced every 3-4 days.\n4. Observation and Analysis\nPeriodic images of the live cells or videos are taken in order to observe the cell behavior over time.  For live images, the cells are placed in a microscope stage top incubator which keeps the cells at 37 °C, 100% humidity, and 5% CO2.  Cells can also be fixed and stained for observation under fluorescence\n The images or videos of the cells that have been captured are imported to an image analysis system and measurements are carried out including growth rate, cell size, migration speed, differentiation, alignment, location of specific proteins, and others.\n5. Representative Results:",
    "A typical result of implementing the plasma lithography technique is the formation of a pattern of cells which resembles some arbitrary or natural structure.  This is seen in Figure 1a-b where lines and networks of neurons have been created.  Other cell types can be used as well as seen in Figure 1c-d, which shows Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and C2C12 skeletal muscle cells forming grids.  Materials such as poly-l-lysine can also be patterned, Figure 1e to facilitate attachment of certain cell types and for other uses.  In the case of the neurons shown, what was created are networks of cells which have connections between them.  This replicates what occurs naturally in the brain where neurons have discrete connections between neighboring cells which influences the operation of the brain.  With the creation of such a structure in the lab, the number, position, frequency and other factors of the connections can be systematically controlled.  The result of these arraignments can be measured visually and additional inputs such as chemical or electrical stimulation can be implemented to probe the network behavior.\nA negative result would be an overgrown or incomplete pattern or a contaminated sample.  An incomplete or overgrown pattern would result from seeding the substrate with either too few or too many cells which would not supply the pattern with an ideal amount of cells.  Additionally, if the pattern is not designed correctly (e.g., lines too narrow) the cells will not be able to attach and grow successfully on it.  In the case of a contaminated sample, proper cleanliness would not have been maintained during one of the steps though this is rare when following proper cell culture protocol due to the fact that the plasma patterning also sterilizes the substrate.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3115/3115fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
