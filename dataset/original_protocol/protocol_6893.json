A cooling speed of -1°C per min should be adequate.Maintain the temperature of the thermal cycler at 4°C after annealing.LigationTransfer the annealed DNA to a 1.7-ml tube.Add 60 µl distilled water.Add 16 µl 10× T4 ligase buffer.Mix the solution by pipetting.Add 4 µl 5× T4 DNA ligase (Total volume of the solution: 160 µl).Mix the solution by pipetting and store in an incubator maintained at 16°C for 16 h.Add 80 µl 5 M NaCl and 560 µl EtOH to the 160 µl solution (after ligation) and mix by pipetting.Incubate the solution at -20°C for more than 2 h.Centrifuge the solution at 4°C (rcf: 16,100 × g, and use balancer).Remove the buffer. Be sure not to suck up the pellet.Dry the pellet by leaving the lid open inside a drawer at room temperature for 30 min to eliminate any remaining EtOH.Dissolve the pellet in 4 µl distilled water and add 4 µl 99% formamide.PurificationPrepare the gel-casting chamber (1-mm thick) and wash with distilled water.Make the denaturing gel (see Recipes).Add 7 µl TEMED and 60 µl 20% APS and mix well.Note: When adding TEMED and APS, the denaturing gel solution should be cool enough to prevent an abrupt solidification before pouring it into the casting chamber. Pour the solution into the interstice of the gel plate set and insert a comb.Wait until the gel has completely solidified.Assemble the inner chamber and mount in the outer chamber.Make 0.",
    "5× TBE buffer and pour into the inner and outer chambers.Place the outer chamber in a heat bath maintained at 55°C.Before pre-running, wash the wells by pipetting.Run the gel at 200 V without any sample loaded for more than 30 min.Stop the pre-running and wash the wells again by pipetting.Load 8 µl sample in each well.Run the gel again for 40 min at 200 V.Stop the gel running and take a picture of the gel under a red-colored lamp.Extract only the first band at the top using a razor.Note: The other bands below the first band correspond to DNA fragments that are not properly ligated. Prepare the gel-purification kit and place the gel slices in a column.Pour 200 µl distilled water into the column and incubate for 16 h at room temperature.Recovery and re-annealingCentrifuge the purification kit at 16,100 × g for 1 min.Collect 180 µl purified DNA and mix with 90 µl 5 M NaCl and 630 µl EtOH.Store at -20°C for 2 h.Centrifuge at 4°C for 40 min.Remove the solution.Dry the open tube in a drawer for 30 min to eliminate any remaining EtOH.Dissolve the pellet in 10 µl distilled water and mix with 0.2 µl 1 M LiCl and 0.4 µl 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).Note: We used LiCl instead of NaCl to prevent G-quadruplex formation during the annealing process. Transfer to a PCR-size tube.Place the tube in a thermal cycler.Incubate for 3 min at 95°CCool the sample slowly from 80°C to 25°C. A cooling speed of -1°C per min is sufficient.Store at -20°C.Antibody labelingDissolve 1 mg maleimide Alexa Fluor 488 dye in 55 µl DMSO.Mix 50 µl antibody and 2 µl dye in 100 mM sodium bicarbonate solution.Incubate the mixture for 2 h at room temperature.Eliminate the unreacted dye by purification using an NAP5-column.",
    "Check the labeling efficiency using a spectrophotometer.Store the labeled antibody at 4°C.Flow cell preparationHole makingMake holes in a quartz slide using a diamond drill bit (Figure 3).Note: If the size of the holes is too large, epoxy glue can leak into the inner space of the flow cell. To prevent this, it is important to compare the size of the holes with the diameter of the PE tubing during drilling. PEG coatingCleaningPlace cover glasses and quartz slides into glass jars.Rinse cover glasses and quartz slides with distilled water several times.Pour Piranha solution (see Recipes) into the jars and incubate for 20-30 min to clean the cover glasses and quartz slides.Repeat step iii another 3 times.Rinse the cover glasses and quartz slides with distilled water several times.SilanizationRinse the cleaned cover glasses and quartz slides twice with methanol.Pour silanization solution (see Recipes) into the jars.Remove the solution after a 30-min reaction.Rinse the cover glasses and quartz slides with methanol and subsequently with distilled water.Remove the cover glasses and quartz slides from the jars and dry by blowing nitrogen gas.PEGylationMake PEGylation solution (see Recipes).Drop 70 µl PEGylation solution on a quartz slide.Place a cover glass on top.Incubate in a drawer for 4 h.Store at -20°C after incubation.Flow cell assembly (Figure 3)Thaw and rinse the PEGylated cover glasses and quartz slides with distilled water.Dry the cover glasses and quartz slides by blowing nitrogen gas.Place the quartz slides on aluminum foil.Attach double-sided tape to the quartz slides to make channels.Place a cover glass on each quartz slide.Block the sides of each channel with epoxy glue.Insert tubing into the holes and fix them with epoxy glue.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4069/bioprotoc-11-13-4069-g003.jpgFigure 3.

    "Inlet and outlet are connected to the injected solution and syringe pump, respectively.Single-molecule fluorescence measurementPreparationTurn on the devices and set the microscope temperature control system to 37°C.Drop a small amount of water on the objective lens as water immersion.Place a fluorescent bead slide on the microscope stage.Drop a small amount of oil on the bead slide and mount a prism.Illuminate the bead slide, and focus on it by properly adjusting the distance between the bead slide and the objective lens.Adjust the illumination area.Turn on the CCD and adjust the dichroic mirrors to divide the imaging area into three different wavelength ranges.Measure the signals from the fluorescent beads.To identify fluorescence signals of different channels from the same molecule, make a reference mapping file with a fluorescent bead image.Note: We use three-color alternating-laser excitation to obtain signals from Cy3, Cy5, and Alexa Fluor 488 dye. To do this, we divide the whole CCD image into three equal areas corresponding to different wavelength ranges. Therefore, we need to know the position information of the same molecules in the different detection channels (see Figure 4). This step is crucial in experiments using a labeled antibody, because only signals emitted by co-localization of the antibody with DNA are considered specific binding. The three dyes were selected due to their superior photostabilities and good quantum yields. Remove the bead slide.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4069/bioprotoc-11-13-4069-g004.jpgFigure 4. Fluorescent bead image to obtain the position information of the same molecules. Fluorescent beads are excited by a 473-nm laser, and images are recorded separately according to three different wavelength ranges (Cy3, Cy5, and Alexa Fluor 488 channels). Through Gaussian fitting, the peaks are searched (white circle: co-localized points).Experiments to observe GQ formation during single-round transcriptionPreparation of the stalled elongation complex.",
    "Note: 11 nucleotides of the non-template strand from the transcription start site consist of only adenine and guanine. If T7 RNA polymerase transcribes the DNA without cytosine and thymine, transcription will be stopped with 11-nt-long RNA. This conformation is called the stalled elongation complex. After immobilizing this stalled elongation complex on the surface of the flow cell, we inject rNTP to restart elongation. Using this strategy, we could observe GQ formation under single-round transcription. Prepare a PCR-size tube with 5 µl distilled water.Add 2.5 µl 4× elongation buffer, 0.25 µl 1 µM DNA, and 0.25 µl mixture of 2.5 mM GTP and ATP.Mix by pipetting.Add 2 µl T7 RNA polymerase.Mix by pipetting very gently.Place tube in a thermal cycler and incubate at 37°C.Note: The incubation time should not exceed 40 min. Due to the error rate of T7 RNA polymerase in transcription, unexpected RNA with the wrong bases could be created and affect the GQ and R-loop formation efficiency. Make 600 µl imaging buffer (see Recipes).Mount the flow cell on the microscope stage.Connect the outlet of the flow cell to a syringe pump.Using a syringe pump, wash out the channel with 90 µl T50 buffer more than twice.Inject 90 µl streptavidin (200 ng/ml) into the channel.Wash out the unbound streptavidin in the channel with T50 buffer 5 min after injection.Turn on the CCD and adjust the focus and illumination area.Add 0.5 µl solution containing the stalled elongation complex to 100 µl imaging buffer and gently mix by pipetting.Inject 90 µl imaging buffer containing the stalled elongation complex into the channel.Check whether the number of spots is sufficient at Cy3 excitation.Wash out the unbound stalled elongation complexes in the channel 3 times with 90 µl imaging buffer.",
    "Add rNTP to the imaging buffer (the final concentration of rNTP should be 2 mM).Move the microscope stage and search for the proper imaging area in the channel.Turn on the auto-focusing system.Note: The auto-focus in the z-direction uses a real-time optical astigmatism analysis of single-molecule images. The detailed methods can be found in our previous paper (Hwang et al., 2012).

(In the case of a time-lapse experiment, measure for 3 min at each time point.",

We recommend finding the proper incident beam intensity by injecting antibody into the flow cell where pre-formed DNA-RNA hybrid exists.",
