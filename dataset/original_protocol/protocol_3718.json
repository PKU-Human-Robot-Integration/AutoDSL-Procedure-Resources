    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCulturing yeast cells to determine the nuclear position of a single DNA locus by imaging\nTiming: [3 days]\nGrow cells overnight at 25°C while shaking (180–220 RPM) in a 50 mL aerated and sterile conical tube containing 3–8 mL of liquid medium (SC or YAP supplemented with the desired carbon source) to reach a maximum concentration of 3–6.106 cells/mL (OD600 = 0.3–0.4) in the morning.\nCritical: Cell concentration should not exceed 1,2.107 cells/mL (OD600=0.8) in SC medium or 2,5.107 cells/mL (OD600=1.1) in YAP medium in order to maintain exponential growth and avoid diauxic shift. If cell concentration is too high, dilute the culture to 1–2.106 cells/mL with fresh medium and let cells grow for at least 4h before starting the experiment.\nFor constitutively expressed loci (e.g., RPL9A), cells growing exponentially in 2% glucose can be directly used. See notes below for loci-specific cultures conditions.\nMonitoring replication origins position requires cell synchronization in G1 and release into S phase\nG1 synchronization is obtained by adding 3 times 2,7 μg of alpha-factor (every hour) per mL to a culture at 5.106 cells/mL at 25°C.\nAfter 2h30 in alpha-factor, divide the cell culture and add 100mM of hydroxyurea (HU) in half of the initial culture to pre-treat cells with HU for 15 min before release. Keep the other half untreated to release cells from alpha-factor without genotoxic agents.\nAfter 2h45 in alpha-factor, wash-out alpha-factor by filtration and transfer cells either into fresh medium for 30 min (untreated culture,S phase condition) or into medium supplemented with genotoxic drugs such as 0.2M hydroxyurea and 0.033% methylmethane sulfonate for 60 min (HU pretreated culture, damaged condition).",
    "We advise to regularly check the status of cells in the cell cycle under a regular optic microscope. Cells synchronized in G1 exhibit a typical “shmoo” projection whereas cells in S phase show a small bud.\nCritical: For the damaged condition, add hydroxyurea in the culture medium at the end of the G1 synchronization (at least 15 min prior to alpha-factor removal) and in the medium where cells will be released into S phase. Adding hydroxyurea 15 min prior to alpha-factor release allows the drug to completely dissolve in the medium and enter cells. Add methyl methanesulfonate solution to cell culture right after washing-out alpha-factor. Alternatively, unsynchronized exponentially growing cells can be directly treated with genotoxic drugs for 1 or 2h. In this case, when analyzing microscopy images, the experimenter can select S phase cells based on their morphology (i.e presence of a small bud).\nNote: GAL1-GAL10 genes change nuclear localization in response to available carbon source. Overnight growth in repressive 2% glucose medium results in an almost random positioning of the GAL1-GAL10 locus in the nuclear volume. Although the non-repressive raffinose medium does not drive expression of GAL genes, overnight growth in 2% raffinose leads to a preferential positioning of the GAL1-GAL10 locus to the nuclear periphery. Galactose-induced expression of GAL genes is efficient in raffinose and leads to a very rapid and strong relocation to the nuclear periphery. Optimum galactose induction occurs at low cell concentration (3.106 cells/mL) and GAL1-GAL10 relocation to the nuclear periphery can be easily scored after 90 min in 2% galactose (from cells grown in 2% raffinose) (See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).",
    "Note: Mating pheromone inducible genes (e.g., FIG2, PRM1 and FUS3) respond to alpha-factor when MATa cells are grown in 2% glucose. Optimum mating pheromone-induction occurs when cells at 5.106 cells/mL are treated 3 times (every hour) with 2,7 μg of alpha-factor per mL of culture at 25°C. Cells are fixed after 2.5 h in the presence of alpha-factor.\nFixing cells with paraformaldehyde\nTiming: [10 mins]\nAt the time of interest, collect 1.5 mL of yeast culture (see previous step) and spin for 1 min at 10 000 × g\nRemove supernatant\nResuspend cell pellet in 50 μL of 4% freshly prepared or freshly opened PFA vial and fix cells for 30–60 s\nCritical: Longer PFA fixation will inactivate the fluorophore.\nSpin immediately at 10 000 × g for 30 s\nRemove supernatant and wash with 500 μL of PBS\nRepeat washes twice\nResuspend cell pellets in 100 to 300 μL of PBS (See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3])\nPause Point: Fixed cells can be stored for several days in PBS at 4°C in the dark or used directly for imaging.\nNote: Using freshly made PFA or PFA freshly opened from a vial is critical to ensure reproducible and optimal fixation of samples. PFA can be prepared from 16% commercial stock vials (e.g., Alfa Aesar) with water.\nPreparing samples on concanavalin A coverslips\nTiming: [30 mins]\nPipet 40μl of fixed cells (see previous step) on a concanavalin A-coated coverslip\nIncubate for 15–20 min at 20°C–25°C\nRemove excess of yeast suspension\nWash cells by adding 50μl of PBS and removing the liquid.\nRepeat wash step twice\nRemove the liquid and add a few drops of mounting medium\nRemove the white paper and stick a SecureSeal adhesive imaging spacer on glass slides\nPeel the clear plastic from the adhesive imaging spacer",
    "Stick the yeast-covered coverslip on the adhesive imaging spacer\nRemove excess of mounting medium with a precision wipe\nCells are ready for imaging\nPause Point: Mounted cells can be stored in the dark for a few hours.\nNote: Although mounting could be done without imaging spacers, the advantage of imaging spacers is to confine yeast cells without compression and to maintain constant humidity. The mounting medium should be chosen appropriately. While PBS can be tolerated for widefield imaging when the object is close to the coverslip, a well matching refractive index mounting media is an absolute requirement for super-resolution imaging. The best mounting medium will (i) preserve fluorescent proteins (eGFP, mCherry) intact, (ii) preserve the 3D shape of the sample and (iii) have a refractive index that matches as much as possible the refractive index of the immersion medium refractive index (e.g., non-curing and DAPI-free VECTASHIELD from Vector Labs). Be aware that the performance of a given mounting medium depends on the fluorophore used.\nWidefield image acquisition\nTiming: [15–30 min/sample]\nIn this section, we describe the settings for experiments using an insertion of 256 copies of the LacO sequence and fluorescently-tagged LacI proteins which tightly bind to the LacO sequences. The insertion of the LacO sequences near a locus of interest allows the visualization of this locus in the nuclear volume. The outer limit of the nucleus is visualized either by the fusion of a fluorescent tag to a protein of the nuclear pore complex (e.g., Nup49) or by expressing a fluorescently-tagged marker of the nucleoplasm (e.g., Pus1). The settings presented in this section can be used as a starting point and might require optimization depending on the widefield microscope used.",
    "Critical: If using different fluorophores (such as GFP and mCherry), ensure that the imaging system’s chromatic correction is within specifications using regular Quality Control procedures. Indeed, due to the very nature of multi-wavelength light, microscopes are subject to chromatic aberrations. Although adequately equipped modern microscopes are less subjected to chromatic aberrations, we advise their measures to avoid introducing a systematic error in our procedure. We do it on a regular basis (i.e every second week) using multi-labelled fluorescent beads slides (such as 1 μm or 4 μm TetraSpeck beads, smaller beads sizes are not recommended as their lower Signal/Background ratio will induce variability). We recommend a final bead concentration of 1bead/10μm2 to ease the image acquisition process and still have enough beads for analysis. Bead center for each channels are localized in 3D and the inter-center distances should be below the reference resolution distance (i.e equivalent to the minimal resolution distance, taking into account the lowest emission wavelength) of a similar bead center couple (Mascalchi and Cordelières, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). The MetroloJ ImageJ plugin is suitable for this calibration.\nTurn on the microscope, camera, fluorescence light source and open the microscopy software\nFocus on cells using transmitted light\nSwitch to 100× objective\nChoose a field of view with a medium cell density (individualized cells; corresponds to 50–80 cells with our settings, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/644-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Zone 1 corresponds to the most peripheral localization whereas zone 3 is central. Red lines indicate the regions which are discarded from the counting at the top and the bottom of the nucleus.\n(E−G) Zoom in on several cells from the sample field of view in (A). (F) Application of the zoning assay by defining the three coordinates required: #1 center of the most proximal nuclear periphery region in front of the DNA-LacI-eGFP spot (NP1), #2 center of the DNA-LacI-eGFP spot (spot), #3 center of the opposite nuclear periphery region in front of the DNA-LacI-eGFP spot (NP2).\n(H) Screenshot of the log file containing the coordinates defined in (F).\nCritical: If no field of view is appropriate, we advise adjusting cell concentration in PBS and preparing new slides as indicated in “preparing imaging samples on concanavalin A coverslips”. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nSwitch to fluorescence excitation light and check signal emission for each fluorophore\nCritical: If fluorescence signal is globally uneven or faint, consider using fresh PFA. Moreover, fixation should not exceed 1 min including centrifugation. Fix again new cells as described in “Fixing cells with paraformaldehyde”. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nSet acquisition parameters in imaging software\nZ-stacks, 50 slices of 0.2 μm (the Z-step size should follow Shannon-Nyquist sampling density criterion as described earlier). Determining the position of a DNA locus in the 3D nucleoplasm requires to cover the whole yeast nucleus. Yeast cells typically range from 4 to 10 μm, thus this setting should cover the majority of cell’s nuclei in any field of view.",
    "X and Y-Tiles, 5 fields of view can be imaged. Robust determination of a DNA locus nuclear position is achieved by measuring its position in at least 200 individual cells. Although measurement is done on individual cells, we recommend imaging cells from at least two independent cultures/treatment to minimize single-culture bias and to ensure reproducibility of the scored biological effect. Adjust the number of fields of view to be imaged according to the cellular density of the sample and to pixel size.\nExcitation power and exposure time have to be adjusted according to the light source, the sensitivity of the camera and the intensity of the signal on the imaging sample, as to both have a high dynamic range, while leaving margin for potentially brighter samples, and keep the fluorescence bleaching low. With a LED light source, we typically set the excitation power to a high value (i.e., 100% for Excelitas X-Cite 120 LED which corresponds to a light intensity of 6.85mW across the full field of view, as measured with a 10× 0.45 dry lens and a OP2-VIS Coherent probe) with a typical exposure time of 200–500ms with an Hamamatsu ORCA Flash4.0 LT sCMOS camera of a peak QE of 82%. Although the tagged locus exhibits a stronger fluorescent signal in comparison to the nuclear periphery since it is bound by multiple fluorescent protein, the aim is to obtain images allowing to position both the nuclear periphery and the tagged locus spot.",
    "Critical: Set the best excitation/exposure time, and EM-gain if relevant (i.e., if using an EMCCD instead of sCMOS camera), to limit bleaching and yield an optimal dynamic range. As bleaching is the result of many parameters, start with above-indicated values and adjust illumination/intensity and exposure time. We typically obtain widefield images with a dynamic range of 5,000 to 10,000 levels, which are further processed with deconvolution algorithms. If needed, lower dynamic ranges may be used, with adapted corrections applied to take into account the lower signal/noise ratio. The experimenter should optimize the settings to obtain good quality images so that foci/nuclear envelope can be both determined.\nSet-up acquisition for each fluorophore in all z-stacks. Yeast outlines can be given using DIC imaging (only acquire the single central plane, as Z information is not relevant).\nTurn on transmission light and focus on the center of the cells\nChoose 5 field of view/tiles and start automatic (or manual) acquisition. A motorized XYZ stage with a mark option is convenient to acquire 5 Z-stacks in a single click.\nWidefield image deconvolution using Huygens Professional\nTiming: [10–20 min/image]",
    "Deconvolution of microscopy images is a computational technique allowing to partly compensate for the image distortion created by an optical system (McNally et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Swedlow, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). This image restoration process is used to improve image resolution, contrast and signal to noise. The change in focal plane during the acquisition of z-series images (3D) generates slightly different images caused by out of focus light coming from above and below the current z-plane. One can consider a biological object as a sum of individual sub-resolution light sources. Because microscope-imaging systems collect only a fraction of the light emitted by these sources, the acquired image appears as a sum of 3D blurry images given by a single point source (aka. the Point Spread Function or PSF). The application of the PSF to every point in the specimen to produce the final image is called a convolution. The restoration procedure of deconvolution would go the opposite way, collecting all this spread light and putting it back to its original location. This process attempts to reconstruct the specimen from a blurred image. Deconvolution largely facilitates DNA-locus position scoring. The procedure and settings described here correspond to the Huygens deconvolution software, but could be applied to other deconvolution programs.\nBefore the actual deconvolution process, remove background locally. We use a region of 0.7μm with the Huygens Professional background estimation algorithm, which identifies 3D regions with the lowest intensity for background estimation. Any other satisfying background removal solution with a different software may be used. The best deconvolution suites estimate and correct the images for the noise (photon shot noise, set-up associated noise). The signal to noise ratio (SNR) of widefield images acquired in the above-mentioned condition is approximately of 100.",
    "Optional: If necessary, apply a bleaching correction to avoid an intensity bias as the first imaged plane will be less affected than the last image of the 3D stack. However, using appropriate conditions of illumination/exposition duration, bleaching was negligible.\nPerform deconvolution with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (CMLE in Huygens) algorithm. Set the maximum number of iterations to 40 and an iteration exit “quality threshold” value (see note) of 0.1%. With this setting, iterations will stop before the maximum 40 value if no more than 0.1% change of the quality value is observed between the last two iterations. This optimizes the restoration duration by stopping unnecessary iterations.\nIf using a correction that takes into account noise, use a SNR value of 100 for sCMOS camera and widefield setups (please note this is different from the signal to background ratio and this parameter aims to correct for photon shot noise mainly). Adjust this value if using lower dynamic ranges for instance or different setups.\nNote: For the purpose of image deconvolution, we used theoretical PSFs. Deconvolution using measured PSF using the 100× alpha Plan-Apochromat 1.46 oil DIC objective and 160nm fluorescent beads did not yield any better result. If the deconvolution software package used does not provide any computed PSF model, the user may use averaged 3D stacks of subresolution fluorescent beads. If it does, consider comparing acquired PSF and computed ones. If the objective quality is optimal, the tedious step of acquiring PSF images can be avoided.",
    "Note: The Huygens software uses a quality criterion that evaluates the difference between the acquired image and the iteration result. It uses a Csiszár's Information Divergence parameter. We typically use a 0.1% change threshold (meaning the iterations stop if the difference between quality factor of iteration n and n+1 is less than 0.1% of quality factor n). This optimizes the restoration time and stops unnecessary iterations. If the deconvolution package used has no such optimization option, the user may try different iterations values and, comparing different restorations results, choose the optimal iteration number. If different microscope setups are used (such as spinning disc confocal microscope), this signal to noise ratio should be reconsidered. Confocal images have a smaller SNR ratio.\n3D structured illumination microscopy image acquisition\n3D-SIM is a super-resolution technique that provides an 8-fold volumetric improvement in resolution. This super-resolution is achieved by mathematically recovering the information, in frequency space, outside the observable region that is produced when the sample is excited by a known 3 dimensional structured pattern (Gustafsson et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nFor further information, a comprehensive view of good practices for 3D-SIM imaging has already been described (Demmerle et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nSwitch on the microscope according to the manufacturer instructions\nConfigure the acquisition to be in “All channel then Z” mode and the focus point at start “Top”\nNote: Choosing the top of the stack as the focus point is more reliable than the middle to acquire the whole nucleus.\nPlace your sample and focus using the transmitted light. This is better than using fluorescence for sample preservation and allows to find the focus from a much larger range\nOptimize the spherical aberrations of the system using oils with different refractive indexes. For example, we use an oil with R.I of 1,512.",
    "Configure the acquisition setting in order to have the highest SNR and the lowest possible photo-bleaching. To do so we have used high EMCCD gains and sacrificed some of the resolution by using relatively high wiener filtering during reconstruction. For a detailed 3D-SIM acquisition, please refer to Demmerle et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]. The following acquisition settings could serve as a starting point prior to further optimization:\neGFP: 5 mW for laser excitation power (measured at the back focal plane of the objective and achieved in our system with a 200mW Laser using a 10% ND filter), 15 ms as exposure time using a Photometrics Evolve 512B camera, EMCCD gain and read frequency at 150 and 5Mhz respectively. We obtain with these settings some 35k gray levels. We reconstruct with a wiener filter at 0,02.\nmCherry: 0.2 mW for laser excitation power (measured at the back focal plane of the objective and achieved in our system with a 100mW Laser using a 1% ND filter), 60 ms as exposure time, EMCCD gain and read frequency at 200 and 5Mhz respectively. We obtain with these settings some 13k gray levels. We reconstruct with a wiener filter at 0,01.\nOptional: If allowed by your equipment, you may mark a certain number of positions and let the microscope perform the acquisitions in an automated way. It is important to minimize microscope displacements and to set a minimal stabilization time prior to acquisition of, at least, 1 s.\nDuring 3D-SIM image reconstruction, use channel specific OTF’s (Optical Transfer Function) and channel specific wiener filters.\nVerify reconstruction quality using Fiji (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2D) and the SIMcheck plugin. If required by your instrument, align channels.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/644-Fig2.jpg",

This correction uses softWoRx, the same software package used for reconstruction. Chromatic shifts are characterized using the manufacturer's alignment slide and procedure for the lateral alignment. We use 200 nm TetraSpeck multi-labeled beads to correct for the axial shifts. Corrected images typically exhibit an error that is below half the lateral resolution for x and y and below 70nm in z across the whole stack.\nManual scoring of a DNA locus position in a 3D nucleus using Fiji\nTiming: [20 min/sample]",
    "The principle of the zoning assay has been extensively described in Meister et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] (Methods in enzymology, Guide to yeast genetics, chapter 21). In this assay, the nucleus is divided in 3 concentric zones of equal volume and the DNA locus, visible as a fluorescent spot, is sorted into one of the three zones. The first zone is associated to the nuclear periphery whereas the third zone corresponds to the center of the nucleus (see Quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] for details). In this setup, a locus whose position is random in the nucleus will have an equal probability of 33% to localize in each of the three zones. Zoning assay requires the coordinates of the spot (fluorescently tagged locus), the distance of the spot to the nuclear periphery (fluorescently tagged) and the diameter of the cell nucleus. Several programs can be used to extract these parameters; we advise to use Fiji (ImageJ) with the freely available PointPicker plug-in. Widefield and 3D-SIM images are compatible with this approach.\nDownload and install the PointPicker plug-in (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/pointpicker/[href=http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/pointpicker/]) on Fiji\nOpen a deconvolved image in Fiji.\nOptional: If the periphery and the spot images are stored in different files, open the two images corresponding to each fluorophore and merge them in a single image. Select Image -> Color -> Merge channels. Select and assigned either images to a color (e.g., Nup49-eGFP/periphery in green and LacI-mCherry/spot in red). This will generate a composite image including both channels/colors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nAdjust the brightness and contrast of the image. Select Image -> Adjust -> brightness/contrast. In the B&C panel, select auto and optimize manually (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nGo to Plugins -> PointPicker. PointPicker options will now appear in the Fiji software (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C)",
    "Navigate into Z-stacks and select nuclei which have a spot positioned between top and bottom poles in order to score the DNA locus position (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nOnce you have selected a nucleus, select the first icon “Add Crosses” and add the first cross in the center of the nuclear periphery fluorescent signal which is closest to the DNA locus spot (  X /  Y  N P 1    ). The second cross marks the fluorescent DNA locus spot center position (  X /  Y  s p o t    ) and the third cross is placed on the opposite side of the nuclear periphery (  X /  Y  N P 2    ) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nCritical: Excluding nuclei which exhibit a tagged DNA locus at the bottom or the top of nuclei poles is essential since these spots can't be correctly assigned to a given zone (e.g., Cell 3 in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F and 1G).\nRepeat nuclei selection (step 44) and coordinates labeling (step 45)\nWhen you reach the appropriate number of scored nuclei (∼200) or until all the nuclei on the opened image have been scored, export the coordinates of the points by selecting the “Export/Import list of points\" icon on the PointPicker toolbar (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).

    "Imaris (Bitplane/Oxford Instruments) is a commercial software allowing 3D reconstruction and cell features measurement. We chose this software as it allows image analysis automation and involves minimal user interaction. We combined it with Imaris-run Matlab routines (available on the Imaris website). Other free 3D solutions can be used.\n“Nuclear” envelopes are identified based on the Pus1-mCherry voxel intensities. LacI-GFP voxel intensity is used to determine the LacI spot 3D coordinates in the nucleus. Then, the nearest distances between these objects are computed using Euclidean distance maps. The distance map transformation process creates a novel “distance” channel. Each voxel intensity in this “distance channel” is equal to its distance to the nearest surface edge/spot. The distance to the “nuclear envelope”, as defined by the Pus1-mCherry signal, is computed with positive values inside the nucleus. Extracted absolute distances can be used directly or applied in an emulated zoning assay. Although widefield images allow for 3D reconstruction and 3D measurements of absolute distances, their lack of resolution and high levels of chromatic aberrations do not guarantee an accurate positioning. Thus, this approach is optimal with high resolution 3D-SIM images.\nOpen the Imaris software, select XT module to allow the use of Matlab routines.\nSelect Observe Folder and choose the reconstructed and aligned images (SIR.ALX) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and E). Images are automatically converted in the .ims format.\nCritical: Check that the microscope has been calibrated and that the voxel size corresponds with images metadata (Edit>Image Properties and Geometry in Imaris), as this is crucial to get appropriate distances.\nOpen one image and start nuclei segmentation:\nAdd new surface using the appropriate channel (e.g., Channel 1 for Pus1-mCherry). If needed, calculation can be optimized using a smoothing factor that will reduce the number of vertices used to draw the nuclear “envelope”.",
    "Define an automatic intensity threshold value to identify nuclei based on their Pus1-mCherry signal intensity (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2F).\nOptional: If not using background-free SIM images, first apply a background removal algorithm if the nucleus segmentation is not adequate. Background Subtraction in Imaris applies a Gaussian filter to estimate the background intensity value of each voxel. This variable background is then subtracted from every voxel in the image. This step is not necessary for SIM images, given their very high contrast.\nAlternatives: Some parameters are fixed (spot size, nucleus size) but some parameters depend of your experiment (the intensity of fluorophores). Making sure segmentation parameters yield appropriate nucleus segmentation for different datasets is highly recommended. If not using an automatic threshold, checking this is even more important. You may have to manually adjust this parameter for different datasets.\nCritical: Nuclei in close proximity could be fused during the segmentation process. If this the case, discard doublets by applying a size filter based on the highest single nucleus volume value typically observed in the dataset.",
    "Identify the LacI loci coordinates. These loci sizes are expected to be subresolution. Segment LacI spots signal by using the “add new spot” function and select the LacI illumination channel (e.g., Channel 2 for LacI-eGFP). Any other spot finding solution (such as find extrema in Fiji) can also be used. Using SIM images, all spots sizes should be close to the resolution limit. The system’s lateral and axial resolutions are typically 110 nm and 300 nm respectively (for 525nm emission wavelength). Thus an “average” value of 0.15μm in all dimensions can be used as a starting value (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2E). Reconsider this value if some spots are not detected or if non-spot features are identified. If using a different microscope setup, reconsider this value with respect to the setup’s resolution. This step only allows spots identification and has no incidence on the actual spot distance measurements.\nNote: The axial resolution of widefield microscopes is roughly two times lower than in the lateral direction, leading to oblong-shaped spots. This can be corrected using the estimated Z PSF size. Alternatively, aberrant spots can be filtered out using some spot-parameter threshold such as total spot intensity/prominence (i.e., ratio of the intensity of the spot compared to its immediate vicinity). We used an automatic quality threshold in Imaris. Make sure this procedure is robust enough so that different datasets are correctly segmented/filtered and only real loci are detected while none that should be found is lost (i.e in haploid cells, a single-tagged locus should give a unique fluorescent spot).",
    "Optional: The point of automatic measurement is to limit user-introduced bias and repetitive unnecessary steps. For both surface and spots parameters, we saved them as “creation parameters templates” and used for batch segmentation of nuclei/LacI loci of whole datasets. Make sure nuclei surfaces are created before spots segmentation in the objects list, as this will be important for the next step.\nControl the nuclear and spot segmentations manually for each image of a dataset.\nCritical: Discard cells containing two spots (e.g., S-phase cells that have already duplicated the fluorescently tagged locus, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) as this will bias the measure.\nOptional: For the purpose of comparing absolutes distance values and zoning assay results, it is necessary to define the nucleus center. Install the XT_MJG_SurfacePositionFinal compiled Matlab routine and run the XTCenterOfMassToSpots XTension on the selected nucleus surface (all extensions may be found either upon request or on the Imaris open permanent XTension repository, https://imaris.oxinst.com/open/[href=https://imaris.oxinst.com/open/]). This will create a spot corresponding to the center of mass of the nucleus. This is a manual step, each image of a given dataset has to be opened and no fully automated emulation of the zoning assay is proposed. The nucleus’ center of mass is an approximation of the geometrical center as the Pus1-mCherry signal is homogeneously distributed throughout the nucleoplasm. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nAlternatives: The Imaris XT module gives access to the use of Matlab compiled algorithm run using Matlab Runtime Environment. You can adjust parameters on 2–3 images and then apply this batch to all of these images. Install the XTBatchProcess Matlab XTension (https://github.com/ppouchin/ImarisXT/blob/master/XTBatchProcess.m[href=https://github.com/ppouchin/ImarisXT/blob/master/XTBatchProcess.m]) together with the XTDistanceTransformInsideObjectForBatch (Matlab and Imaris should be on the same workstation). Refer to the Batch Process readme.txt file to use this batch version of distance transformation.\nMeasure the absolute distance between the LacI spot and the nuclear rim:",
    "Download the distanceTransform.exe compiled Matlab XTension.\nSelect the nuclei surface and run the distance Transformation XTension (use the inside mode to compute the distance to the envelope of the nuclear voxels). The software creates a new channel (e.g., Channel 3) which corresponds to the distance between any locus and the nuclear periphery.\nCritical: 32bits 3D-SIM images are directly compatible with fine distance measurements (as intensities are floating-point numbers). If using other bit depth dataset, convert them to 32 bits prior to distance calculation (otherwise distances will be expressed as integer and prevent fine distance measurement).\nOptional: For the purpose of emulating the zoning assay, measure the absolute distance between the LacI spot and the nucleus center by selecting the center of the nucleus and using compiled distanceTransformation routine. The software creates a new channel (e.g., channel 4) which correspond to the distance between the locus and the nucleus center. If using XTBatchProcess Xtension, move the nucleus center spot first in the object list, then run the XTBatchProcess and the XTDistanceTransformOutsideObjectForBatch so that this optional step is automated.\nImaris offers the possibility to quickly compile all nuclei/spot values using the Vantage module. Create a new Vantage 1D Plot from the Arena using intensity Center Channel 3/nuclear periphery and another one using intensity center Channel 4/nucleus center or export the distances values in a spreadsheet."
