    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSurgery\nTiming: 3 h\nA Microdrive is implanted above the dHPC and a craniotomy is created on the skull above the mPFC for patch-clamp recordings.\nAnesthetize the rat by inhalation of isoflurane gas at a concentration of 3.0% using standard methods.\nCritical: Appropriate regulations and guidelines for rat experiments must be followed.\nCritical: Lower the concentration of isoflurane gas to 1%–2% 15 min after the start of anesthesia. Monitor the animal's respiration rates throughout the anesthesia period.\nPlace the rat on a heating pad, shave the fur from the top of the head and then fix the head in the stereotaxic instrument with two ear bars and a nose clamp.\nInject 0.03 ml of 0.5% lidocaine as a local anesthetic into the scalp (s.c.), apply eye ointment, and then cover the eyes with aluminum foil to protect them from the surgical light. Clean the surface of the head skin with betadine.\nMake an incision along the midline of the scalp from the area between the eyes to the back of the head and remove the periosteal soft tissue within the incised area. Clean the surface of the skull.\nCritical: Confirm that the height of the bregma and the lambda are similar horizontally.\nMark the target positions of the centers of the craniotomies with a black pen (3.0 mm anterior and 1.2 mm lateral to bregma for the right mPFC; 3.6 mm posterior and 4.0 mm lateral to bregma for the right dHPC).\nMake 13 holes (0.8 mm diameter) in the skull at areas indicated by black dots in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A (their coordinates described in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), using a high-speed drill (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B1). Implant a stainless-steel screw into each of the holes as an anchor.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/707-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Surgical procedures",

The values in parenthesis beside the holes represent approximate coordinates from the bregma (in mm; anterior, lateral).\n(B1–B11) Critical surgical steps are shown. The cyan arrows in B2 indicate holes for multiunit ground electrode screws. The cyan arrows in B3 indicate holes for implanted multiunit ground electrode screws and the magenta arrow in B3 indicates the fan-shaped cover attached to the skull. The dotted box in the left panel in B4 is magnified in the right panel. The magenta arrow in B4 is the thinned skull on the mPFC. The picture in B5 is vertically flipped from that in B4. The magenta arrow in B5 indicates the polyimide tuning put on the thinned skull. The arrow in B6 indicates the cranial window for the dHPC. The arrow in B7 indicates the cranial window for the dHPC. The arrows in B8 indicate the 1-cm cubes. The arrows in B9 indicate the L-shaped parts attached on the cubes. Pictures in B10 were taken with the black background for visibility. In B10, make a vertical incision throughout the cover with a scissors (cyan dots) (top) and wrap the microdrive with the cover from the bottom part of the microdrive (bottom, from left to right).\nCritical: The sites of the stainless-steel screws must be more than 3 mm distant from the two craniotomy centers.\nCritical: The screws on the frontal side are especially crucial, as they serve as anchors to attach to the fan-shaped cover with adhesive at step 8.",
    "Using a high-speed drill, make 2 holes (0.8 mm diameter) in the skull above the cerebellum (6.0 mm posterior and 2.0 mm bilateral to bregma) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B2), as shown by cyan dots in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, and implant a multiunit ground screw electrode into each of the holes.\nPlace the hole of the fan-shaped cover around the craniotomy and attach to the skull with adhesive (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B3). Put a small drop of adhesive accelerator to facilitate the effect of the adhesive. This cover is necessary to protect against invasion of dental cement and serve as a saline storage pool for placing a patch-clamp ground electrode for subsequent patch-clamp recordings.\nCritical: The positioning of the fan-shaped cover is crucial. The distance between the posterior end of the fan-shaped cover and the anterior end of the craniotomy for the dHPC must be more than 3.0 mm. If this distance is too short, the patch-clamp pipettes physically interfere with the microdrive.\nCritical: A 26 gauge needle is helpful to put adhesive to small areas around the edge of the cover from both the inside and outside.\nCritical: Avoid putting adhesives to the skin.\nMake a craniotomy on the skull with a diameter of 1.4 mm above the right mPFC using a high-speed drill (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B4). Putting a small drop of 70% ethanol on the skull is helpful to soften the bone while drilling. Stop drilling when the skull becomes a thin membrane (thin skull). Leave the dura intact.\nCritical: Perform this step under the stereomicroscope. Using a small drill bit (e.g., 0.80 mm diameter), drill around the target point to thin the bone.\nCritical: Avoid penetrating the skull and exposing the dura.",
    "Gently put the polyimide tubing vertically onto the thinned skull to physically protect it (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B5). This process does not use any adhesives. If the tubing does not fit the thinned skull, make the diameter of thinned skull larger or make a small cut along the tubing so that the diameter of tubing is flexibly adjustable. Sterilize the surface of the thin skull, the tubing, and the fan-shaped cover with 70% ethanol, and place surgical tape (∼20 mm) on the tubing to protect the thin skull from dust during subsequent housing.\nTo implant a microdrive into the dHPC, perform a craniotomy with a diameter of ∼2 mm (fitted to the bundle of the microdrive) using a high-speed drill (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B6).\nCritical: Perform this step at high magnification under the stereomicroscope. Avoid blood vessels as much as possible. Make sure to avoid drilling through the bone and dura all at once.\nMake a small incision in the dura above the right dHPC using the tip of a 26 gauge needle. Using forceps with very fine tips, take hold of the dura at the incision and gently pull it away until the dura is removed. All layers of the dura must be removed to ensure that the tetrodes can enter into the brain cleanly. Once the dura is removed, keep the brain surface from drying out (i.e., with saline) during the rest of the procedure.\nCritical: Perform this step at high magnification under the stereomicroscope. Avoid blood vessels as much as possible.\ntroubleshooting 1\nPosition the tip of the bundle of the microdrive at a distance of ∼3 cm above the craniotomy using the custom-made microdrive holder and slowly lower it using the manipulator until the tip is placed inside the skull and contacts the surface of the brain (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B7).",
    "Critical: Perform this step at high magnification under the stereomicroscope.\nPlace a drop (∼0.05 ml) of the sodium alginate solution using a pipette to cover the craniotomy and the tip of the bundle, and then place a drop (∼0.05 ml) of the CaCl2 solution using a pipette to the same area. Mixing the two solutions yields a gel within 1 min, covering the craniotomy and the tip of the bundle. Try this step until the entire craniotomy is protected from outside air.\nCritical: Perform this step at high magnification under the stereomicroscope.\nNote: This gel prevents the craniotomy and the bundle from attaching to the dental cement.\nPour liquid dental cement at a thickness of ∼4.0 mm throughout the surface of the brain and wait until it turns solid. This is the first step to lightly secure all of the wires, all of the stainless-steel screws, and the bundle of the microdrive to the skull. Do not secure the patch-clamp reference ring from the multiunit ground screw electrodes. At this point, keep the microdrive by the holder.\nAttach the 1-cm cube as an anchor to each side of the exposed skull at the location above the ear (equal to the bottom line of the dental cement put in step 15) with dental cement (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B8). Then, attach a L-shaped part on the cube with dental cement on each side (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B9). If the L-shaped parts are not perfectly horizontally placed, try to adjust their positions before they are completely fixed to the cube. These anchor parts are subsequently used for fixing the rat to the stereotaxic apparatus for patch-clamp recordings.\nCritical: Both sides of the cube and L-shaped parts must be placed horizontally. This procedure is crucial to horizontally fix the rat’s head for subsequent patch-clamp recordings.",
    "Cut vertically the microdrive cover with scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B10, top) and wrap the microdrive with the cover (for more detail, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B10, bottom).\nSolder the open ends of the wires from the multiunit ground screw electrodes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E) to ground channels on the electrical interface board on the microdrive.\nSimilar to step 15, secure all of the wires, the microdrive, and microdrive cover, to the skull. Leave the patch-clamp reference ring part of the multiunit ground screw electrodes protruding outside the microdrive as they are used as reference electrodes for patch-clamp recordings (step 35). Repeat this step until dental cement covers ∼90% of the bundle of the microdrive and the internal sides of the 1-cm cubes. Detach the microdrive holder from the rat’s head when finalized (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B11).\nCritical: Make sure to fill the space on the exposed skull at the front side of the fan-shaped cover with dental cement.\nInsert the tip of the tetrodes from the bundle at a depth of 0.75 mm into the brain by turning the screws on the microdrive.\nRemove the rat from the stereotaxic apparatus. Terminate the anesthesia. Place the rat in a plastic cage and confirm that the animal spontaneously wakes up from anesthesia. House the rat individually. As some rats jump within a cage, use a relatively large cage with a sufficient height to prevent physical interference of the microdrive with the ceiling of the housing cage. Our cage is 29.5 cm × 45 cm in size and 26 cm in height with a hole for a water bottle nozzle on the wall. Provide food pellets on the bedding.",
    "Following surgery, house the rat individually in the cage with free access to water and food for at least 7 days. Monitor the body weight every day and confirm that post-surgery body weight returns to pre-surgery body weight.\nAdjustment of electrode depth, behavioral training, and habituation to a head-fixed condition\nTiming: 2–4 weeks (approximately 120 min per day)\nTetrodes reach the hippocampal cell layer. The rats are fully trained for behavioral task and habituated to a head-fixed condition.\nBeginning the day after the surgery, connect the rat to the multiunit recording equipment via the recording headstage (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and perform tetrode turning to advance the tetrode tips 25–250 μm per day for 2–4 weeks until spiking cells are observed from the hippocampal cell layer. Generally, one tetrode can record 3–10 hippocampal pyramidal neurons with spike amplitudes of more than 100 μV when the tetrode was properly positioned on the cell layer, as indicated by apparent clusters of neuronal spike parameters (waveform amplitudes, the peak-to-trough amplitude differences, and waveform energies) in multidimensional projection space (Buzsaki, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Lin et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Michon et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Mou and Ji, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Osanai et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]; Shan et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). Once the tetrodes are adjacent to the cell layer, settle the tetrodes at those positions for stable recording over a period of several days.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/707-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Critical steps after multiunit electrode implantation\nThe arrow in B indicates feeding of chocolate milk from the pipette. The arrow in C indicates saline solution filled in the fan-shaped cover. The arrow in D indicates the wire ring connected to the alligator clip. The dotted box in the left panel in E is magnified in the right panel. The arrow in E indicates the patch pipette tip.",
    "Note: This procedure is similar to general protocols performed in a number of studies with tetrode recordings.\nEach day, after electrode turning, train animals on behavioral tasks (e.g., spatial task), if appropriate. Start food restriction for behavioral training at least 7 days after the surgery, if necessary. In this case, care must be taken to maintain each rat’s body weight to more than 85% of its ad libitum weight.\nNote: After electrode tuning and behavioral training, habituate the rat to a head fixation condition, as described in the next step.\nFix the rat’s head to a plastic headplate (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Attach plastic barriers to the stereotaxic apparatus with surgical tapes (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). This barrier physically protects the microdrive and patch pipettes from scratching by the hindlimbs.\nTo habituate the rat to the head fixation condition, provide a chocolate milk drop directly to the rat’s mouth using a pipette for 10–30 min. On the first five days, keep a pipette delivering the chocolate milk solution to the rat’s mouth throughout the habituation period for up to 10 min. Terminate this daily habituation when the rat begins to exhibit substantial movement. When the rat becomes familiar with this condition after five days of habituation, increase the habituation duration to 30 min by providing a chocolate milk drop (∼0.3 ml) every 5 min using a pipette. When the rat moves the hindlimb, provide chocolate milk immediately. This habituation lasts 10–17 days.",
    "Critical: Some rats continuously move substantially (e.g., kicking and crying) during head fixation. This issue sometimes happens even one week after habituation. If the rat continues to show intense movement for three consecutive days, terminate the experiment and euthanize the rat, as it is impossible to obtain patch-clamp recordings from such rats. To our experience, 7 out of 51 (13.7%) rats showed such behavior and the experiments were terminated before patch-clamp recordings.\nMultiunit recordings of dHPC neurons during a behavioral period\nTiming: 60 min (flexible)\nSpike patterns are recorded from dHPC neuronal ensembles during behavioral tasks.\nPerform multiunit data recordings from the dHPC during a behavioral task once the rat has sufficiently learned the task and well-separated unit activity is identified in the dHPC (Buzsaki, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Michon et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Mou and Ji, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Osanai et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nNote: This is a general step for multiunit recordings. In our recording, the sampling rate of LFP signals is 2 kHz, and unit spike waveforms are bandpass filtered at 600 Hz to 6 kHz and recorded at 30 kHz for 1.6 ms when the amplitude exceeds a trigger threshold. Monitor the rat’s behavior using a video camera, if appropriate.\nPatch-clamp recordings\nTiming: 60 min\nAfter the rat is head-fixed, membrane potential changes are recorded from mPFC neurons by whole-cell recordings.\nAfter the multiunit recordings from the freely moving rat are finished, fix the rat to the stereotaxic apparatus and attach plastic barriers to the stereotaxic apparatus, similar to the habituation step (step 25).\nCut the whiskers to prevent contact with the patch pipettes.\nApply ∼1 ml of 0.5% lidocaine solution dissolved in saline as an analgesic to the saline pool surrounded by the fan-shaped cover above the skull of the mPFC (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Critical: This analgesic is necessary for the next step 31.\nRemove the polyimide tubing from the thin skull above the mPFC.\nCritical: Do not use a drill, as the rat is awake.\nCritical: If the surgical procedures (steps 8-10) have been correctly performed, a scab-like structure is generally formed on the thin skull in the lumen of the polyimide tubing. When the tube is removed from the head, the scab-like structure and the thin skull should be easily peeled off together.\ntroubleshooting 2 and 3\nRemove the lidocaine solution in the pool by a pipette and apply the same amount of saline to the pool.\nMake a small incision in the dura above the mPFC using a 30-gauge stainless-steel needle. Using forceps with very fine tips, take hold of the dura at the incision and gently pull it away until the dura is removed. All layers of the dura must be removed to ensure that patch pipettes can enter the brain cleanly. Once the dura is removed, keep the brain surface from drying out (i.e., with saline) during the rest of the procedure.\nCritical: Perform this step at high magnification under the stereomicroscope.\nCritical: Perform this step carefully to minimize damage to the brain tissue and bleeding around the dura.\ntroubleshooting 4\nDip a patch-clamp ground electrode (generally, it is a stone-shaped electrode protruding from the headstage of the patch-clamp recording system) in the saline pool, serving as a ground electrode for patch-clamp recordings.\nConnect alligator clips to the patch-clamp reference ring part of the multiunit ground screw electrodes protruding outside the microdrive (step 19) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Then, connect the other end of the clip to any metal parts of the patch-clamp ground electrode.",
    "Note: This step is necessary in multiunit recordings to cancel electrical noise arising from the patch-clamp recording setup.\nThrough the hole, lower a borosilicate glass pipette filled with whole-cell internal solution, tilted at an angle of 10–15° to the posterior side and 0–15° to the medial or lateral side, to the mPFC at a depth of 750–3600 μm from the cortical surface (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). First, lower the pipette relatively faster at a speed of 50–100 μm/s before reaching an approximate target depth. Then, reduce the speed to 1–2 μm/s to access a neuron to obtain a patch-clamp recording. This final process of accessing a patch pipette to a neuron in the brain is similar to the protocols used for in vivo patch-clamp recordings (Lee et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Lee et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Petersen, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). Apply rectangular current pulses continuously during access and monitor changes in voltage responses to the pulses.\nCritical: Perform this step while the rat does not show bruxism, which disturbs the monitoring of the correct voltage responses.\nCritical: Perform this step in a silent environment. Loud sounds stimulate movement by the rat, which reduces the success rates of patch-clamp recordings.\nCritical: The angle of access of the patch pipette needs to be flexibly adjusted to prevent physical interference between the patch pipette and the microdrive.\ntroubleshooting 5\nObtain whole-cell recordings from a neuron by recording equipment using standard in vivo whole-cell recording methods (Lee et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Lee et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Petersen, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). Generally, it should require approximately 10–20 attempts to obtain a stable whole-cell recording in one rat.",
    "Critical: Discard neurons when the series resistance exceeds 75 MOhm or the mean resting potential exceeds –50 mV. Truncate recordings when the spike peak decreases below –10 mV or the resting potential increases by more than 40 mV from its baseline value at the onset of the recording. Null the liquid junction potential offline.\ntroubleshooting 6\nIf patch-clamp recordings are not successful, it is possible to try again within the next 2 days before thick tissue is formed on the mPFC craniotomy. In that case, place polyimide tubing on the craniotomy to protect the craniotomy again, as described in step 10.\nAt the beginning of each whole-cell recording, inject depolarizing and hyperpolarizing 1000-ms rectangular currents from –200 to +350 pA into the cell at steps of 50 pA to characterize the cell’s intrinsic properties and spike responses. Select cells that show typical regular-spiking characteristics as principal cells.\nThroughout this recording process, confirm that the rat exhibits no behavioral signs of pain.\nHistological verification of recording locations\nTiming: 3 days\nRecording locations of tetrodes and cell morphology of the patched neurons are verified in the dHPC and mPFC, respectively.\nAt the end of the patch-clamp recordings, slowly raise the patch pipette at a speed of 5 μm/s while monitoring the membrane resistance. This step is crucial to reconstruct the cell morphology without disrupting the cell membrane. First, the resistance becomes more than 1 GΩ, a sign of outside-out recording. When the resistance then becomes less than 1 GΩ, indicating that the pipette is detached from the cell membrane, increase the speed to 100 μm/s and pull the pipette out from the brain.\nDetach the headstage of the microdrive from the rat. Inject 0.3 ml of 0.1 g/ml urethane (i.p) and wait until the rat is fully anesthetized.",
    "Perfuse the brain transcardially with saline followed by a 4% PFA solution using a standard perfusion method.\nDecapitate the rat and store the brain in air for 12 h at 4°C without withdrawing the tetrodes from the brain.\nNote: This step is necessary to facilitate the reconstruction of the tetrode tracks.\nRemove the brain and store it for 12 h at 4°C in a 4% PFA solution.\nWith a blade, coronally cut the forebrain into two pieces of tissue at approximately 6.0 mm posterior to the olfactory bulb (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A), an anterior piece containing the mPFC (tissue 1) and the remaining posterior piece containing the dHPC (tissue 2).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/707-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Procedures for histological verification\n(A) The forebrain is divided into two pieces of tissue with a blade, an anterior part containing the mPFC (tissue 1) and a posterior part containing the dHPC (tissue 2).\n(B) (Left) Slices from tissue 1 are stained with streptavidin, whereas slices from tissue 2 are stained with cresyl violet. (Right) Representative images of a cresyl violet-stained brain section showing tetrode locations in the dHPC (top, black arrowheads) and a biocytin-labeled patched mPFC neuron (bottom).\nFor tissue 1, slice the tissue at a thickness of 100–150 μm in PBS using a vibratome (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nTo visualize the biocytin-filled cell morphology of the patched cells in the mPFC, process the slices with 2 μg/ml streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 6 h.\nIncubate the slices with 0.4% NeuroTrace 435/455 blue fluorescent Nissl Stain dissolved in PBS for 12 h at 4°C.\nFor tissue 2, equilibrate the tissue with a sequence of 20% sucrose in PBS for 24 h and 30% sucrose in PBS for 24 h.\nFreeze and slice the tissue at a thickness of 150 μm using a microtome (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Mount the slices on a coverglass and process them for a standard cresyl violet staining method. Confirm the tracks of all tetrodes in the dHPC in the histological tissue."
