    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nN-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), a carcinogenic agent, generates somatic mutations in epithelial cells of the stomach and induces tumor formation. In this article, we show that the standard tumorigenesis protocol using MNU (240 ppm) can generate gastric tumors at high incidence in the antrum.\nNote: Although MNU can be used to induce intestine and colon tumors, the ways of drug administration are quite different. Mice are usually injected with MNU by intraperitoneal administration for intestine tumor induction and by intrarectal administration for colon tumor induction.\nMNU solution preparation\nTiming: 10 min\nThis step allows you to dissolve MNU in drinking water.\nUse a light-shielded bottle or cover a transparent one with appropriate size of aluminum foil.\nWeigh 0.012 g MNU powder on a precise analytical balance under a light-shield condition.\nPlace the MNU into the bottle prepared in step 1.\nDissolve MNU in 50 mL sterile drinking water.\nCritical: Due to instability of MNU, we suggest preparing small amounts of the solution (50 ml) and change it periodically.\nNote: MNU is a toxic carcinogen and photodecomposition occurs easily. Be very careful when handling it and use appropriated personal protective equipment.\nNote: The concentration of MNU in drinking water is 240 ppm. It is known that more time is needed for lower concentrations of MNU to induce gastric tumors (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nMNU treatment\nTiming: 10 weeks",
    "Optional: To mimic the microenvironment of human stomach, mice can be infected with H. pylori in 0.2 ml trypticase broth by oral gavage 3 times per week, 2 weeks before MNU administration. The total dose of H. pylori is around 100 million colony-forming units per mouse (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The dose can be quantified by counting the bacteria on slides under microscope or routine culture plate counting method. H. pylori in the gastric gland can be detected by Warthin–Starry staining.\nTumorigenesis in murine stomach relies on oncogenic cues. Here, mice are exposed to MNU, a carcinogen generated by H. pylori, in the chemical-induced model (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1028-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Green line represents the duration of inhibitor treatment.\n(D) A scheme for MNU treatment with H. pylori infection in TAM-induced genetically modified mice.\nNote: We recommend using mice at 2–3 months of age. We keep 4 mice in one cage.\nPlace the light-shielded water bottle containing MNU on the cage so the mice have free access.\nTwo days later, replace the MNU solution with newly prepared solution.\nNote: Repeat the steps 1–4 in the end of step 6. Due to instability of MNU, we suggest the frequency of change is thrice per week or every other day to keep the potency of the agent.",
    "After one week of MNU treatment, take out the light-shielded bottle and change it for the normal transparent bottle containing just drinking water.\nOne week later, the transparent bottle should be changed for the light-shielded bottle containing MNU solution.\nCritical: Steps 5–8 comprise one cycle (2 weeks). Repeat the treatment for 5 cycles in wild-type or TAM-induced genetically modified mice.\nRepeat step 5 to step 8 for 4 more cycles (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nFree feeding and drinking\nTiming: approximately 22 weeks\nMice are housed in a pathogen-free facility with free access to food and water waiting for the development of gastric tumors, for approximately 22 weeks.\nNote: The feeding period after treatment with MNU is flexible and the mice can be sacrificed from weeks 18–26. In addition, the feeding time with low concentration MNU (60 or 120 ppm) should increase to 32–40 weeks.\nOptional: The feeding time is an appropriate period for other treatments. Mice can be administered with inhibitors, such as U0126 and LDN-193189, MEK1 and BMPR1A inhibitors respectively, or other drugs via intraperitoneal injection every other day (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTumor tissue collection and subsequent process\nTiming: 3 days\nCollect the stomach tissues, take photos of tumors and perform H&E or immuno-staining.\nAnesthetize the mice using 40 mg/mL Avertin (240 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection.\nAlternatives: In addition to Avertin, mice can be anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection.\nLay down the animal and fix it on the surgical platform, remove the ribs and carefully expose the heart avoiding the rupture of other tissue, especially the major blood-vessels near the heart.\nPerfuse sterilized PBS to flush out blood from the heart after removing the auricle (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).",
    "Critical: During perfusion, inject the PBS slowly at a constant speed. The color of lungs and livers should become light, indicating the loss of blood after a successful perfusion.\nAfter perfusion, carefully harvest the stomach and then open the organ along the great curve, wash the tissue with cold PBS three times to remove the food debris (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1028-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bar: 100 μm.\n(E) Tumor numbers, average size, and histologic grades in mice induced by MNU. Data are represented as mean ± SD, n = 7 per group, this figure has been modified from Li et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nUnfold the stomach on a white platform or paper to expose the interior of forestomach, corpus, and antrum, and take photos (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Next, quantify the number of tumors in each animal and calculate their volume using a caliper.\nNote: The number of tumors is around 2 and the size is from 0.8 to 12 mm3 in wild-type mice. In some genetically modified mice, the size is up to 80 mm3 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCut the tumor tissues into several pieces. One part is for histopathological analysis and other parts are frozen for future RNA or protein extraction.",
    "Place the tissue into 4% PFA solution to fix it one night and transfer to 70% ethanol for histological analysis.\nPause point: Tissues can be kept in 70% ethanol at 4°C for a short period of time (l week maximal) before proceeding to the next step.\nPerform the routine dehydrating and paraffin embedding procedures for H&E staining.\nTransfer tissues from PFA solution to 70% ethanol for 1 h.\nDehydrate the tissues in increasing concentrations of ethanol, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100% for 1 h each.\nImmerse the tissues in dimethyl benzene (100%) for derosination and transparency enhancement for 1 h and then wax them for 3 h. The paraffin should be changed once every hour.\nEmbed the tissue in paraffin blocks and cut them into 4–5 μm sections for H&E staining or other histological staining.\nOptional: Between dehydration and dimethyl benzene treatment, tissues can be transferred to a mix of absolute ethanol and dimethyl benzene for 1 hour, as an intermediate stage.\nNote: The histologic classification of tumors can be defined by H&E staining. The sign of hyperplasia is the dysplasia of gastric epithelium with elongation of gland units, and the advanced tumor with glandular and cellular distortion is considered to be adenoma (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.
