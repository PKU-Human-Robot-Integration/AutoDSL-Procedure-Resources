    "Ethics statement: Ethical approval for collection of lymphatic malformation and foreskin tissues was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committees at the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. Signed consent was received from patients’ parents prior to surgery. Tissue samples were collected from patients diagnosed with LMs undergoing surgical procedures as part of their clinical management and patients undergoing elective circumcision. All experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia.\n1. Preparation of Cell Suspension from Foreskin and Lymphatic Malformation Tissues\nBuffers and Media Preparation.\n\t\nPrepare complete endothelial cell media using commercially available EGM-2 MV Bullet Kit by warming EGM-2 media and gently thawing the kit components in 37 °C water bath. In class II biosafety cabinet, aseptically add each component to the EGM-2 media. Once all components are added to the media, refer to this media as ‘complete endothelial cell media’. Use sterile 50 ml pipette to mix the contents prior to use.\nNOTE: All steps pertaining to cell culture are performed in a class II biohazard cabinet. All solutions are stored at 4 °C as per manufacturers’ instructions and are warmed to room temperature prior to use. The complete endothelial cell media, cell culture buffers and enzyme solutions are warmed at 37 °C for 20 min prior to use.\nSupplement complete endothelial cell media with 50 ng/ml VEGF-C. Aliquot the supplemented endothelial cell media into 50 ml sterile tubes and store at 4 °C until use. The media is stable for at least 4 weeks when stored at 4 °C.",
    "Prepare calcium and magnesium free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by dissolving 8.752 g NaCl, 1.416 g Na2HPO4.2H2O and 0.395 g KH2PO4 in 1,000 ml of water. Adjust pH to 7.4. Filter sterilize PBS using 0.22 μm filter and store at 4 °C. Prior to use add antibiotic/antimycotic solution (used at 1:100).\nTo prepare human fibronectin, dissolve 1 mg of fibronectin in 10 ml of sterile water. Store reconstituted solution in 100 μl aliquots at -20 °C. On the day of use add 10 ml of sterile PBS to 100 μl of fibronectin aliquot (to give a final working concentration of 10 μg/ml).\nFor the enzyme media, prepare a solution containing 0.04% Dispase II, 0.25% Collagenase II and 0.01% DNase I in sterile PBS. First, weigh dispase and collagenase, place in a sterile 50 ml tube, add the required volume of PBS and incubate for 30 min with shaking at 37 °C to dissolve. Once dissolved, filter sterilize (0.22 μm filter) dispase/collagenase solution in biosafety hood. Aseptically add the DNase I. Store the enzymatic solution at 37 °C until use.\nNOTE: DNase I is a commercial cell culture grade reagent available as sterile lyophilized powder.\n2. Preparation of Cell Suspension from Foreskin and Lymphatic Malformations\nWeigh a 50 ml tube containing 10 ml of DMEM/2% antibiotic antimycotic solution. This tube will be used for tissue collection.\nFollowing surgical removal of lymphatic malformation and foreskin tissues, aseptically add tissue specimen to the tube and transfer on ice to the cell culture laboratory.\nWeigh the tube containing the tissue and calculate tissue weight. Use this weight to calculate the volume of enzymatic solution needed to digest the tissue.",
    "In a Class II biosafety cabinet, use sterile forceps to transfer the tissue and media into a 100 mm tissue culture dish. Use sterile scissors to finely mince the tissue into ~1 mm3 pieces.\nTransfer minced tissue mixed with media into a 50 ml tube containing an additional 10 ml of sterile DMEM/2% antibiotic antimycotic solution. Mix by inversion to re-suspend the tissue. Centrifuge the sample at 300 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant. Based on tissue weight, add 1 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) collagenase II/DNase I/ Dispase II digestion solution per 100 mg of minced tissue. Generally, use 10 ml of enzyme solution for approximately 1 g of minced tissue.\nIncubate the tissue in a 37 °C incubator for 20-90 min with constant shaking at 200 rpm. At the end of this period, ensure that nearly all of the tissue is digested into fine fragments.\nNOTE: Exposure of the cells to collagenase and dispase at the time of isolation from the primary tissues influences cell survival. We have found empirically that most neonatal foreskin samples optimally require 20-30 min of digestion, whereas fibrotic lymphatic malformation samples may require 60-90 min of digestion. LM LEC yields are influenced by the amount of fibrosis present, more fibrous tissue yielding fewer cells, possibly due to deleterious effects of prolonged exposure to collagenase II and dispase II.\nFollowing digestion, transfer the tube to the biosafety cabinet and pass the digested tissue solution through a 70 μm strainer placed into a sterile 50 ml tube. Using 3 ml syringe piston with rubber plunger, grind down the remaining tissue until only small traces of extracellular matrix are observed.",
    "Wash the cell strainer with a volume of endothelial cell medium equivalent to the volume of dissociating enzyme medium to recover cells stuck to sieve and to inactivate the enzymes. For example, for 2 ml of dissociating enzyme medium to digest the minced tissue, add 2 ml of endothelial cell medium to inactivate the enzymes.\nCentrifuge the cell solution at 300 x g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant. R>e-suspend the cells in 10 ml of PBS. Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant then repeat cell wash twice. >Resuspend the cell pellet in 20 ml of endothelial cell medium. Count cells using trypan blue then seed 2 x 10>6 cells in 150 cm>2 flask pre-coated with fibronectin in a final volume of 20 ml of endothelial cell medium. Culture at 37 °C in a 5% CO>2 in humidified air incubator.>\nNOTE: It is expected that 75%-90% of nucleated cells survive tissue digestion as estimated by trypan blue exclusion. The initial cell count reflects all nucleated cells in the cell suspension (i.e. keratinocytes, leukocytes, macrophages, connective tissue cells and blood vessel cells). The cell count at 5-7 days reflects cells that have attached, survived and proliferated during cell culture. Coating tissue culture flasks with fibronectin also improves subsequent LEC and LM LEC survival.\nAfter overnight incubation, wash away unbound cells in three washes with PBS/1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution and add fresh endothelial cell medium. Carry out three washes to effectively remove unbound cells and red blood cells present in the flask. Change media every second day. Cells will be ~80% confluent after 5-7 days.\n3. Antibody Staining of Cells for Lymphatic Endothelial Cell Surface Markers for Flow Cytometry\nAfter the cells have reached 80% confluence, aspirate medium and rinse cells with PBS.",
    "Detach adherent cells by incubating cells with 7 ml of cell detachment solution such as Accutase per 150 cm2 flask for 5-7 min at 37 °C.\nHarvest detached cells, inactivate the cell detachment solution by adding 3 volumes of endothelial cell medium and transfer the cell suspension to a new sterile tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate supernatant and re-suspend the cells in 5 ml of PBS. Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant then repeat cell wash. Re-suspend the cells in 5 ml of PBS.\nCount the number of viable cells. Mix 10 μl of cell suspension with 90 μl of 0.4% trypan blue. Transfer 10 μl of this suspension to hemocytometer for counting.\nNOTE: The final cell yield will depend on the sample size processed. The usual cell yield per 150 cm2 flask ranges from 7 x 105 to 1.2 x 106 of viable cells.\nPrepare the antibody solutions for cell staining.\nNOTE: The following dilutions were titrated for staining 1 x 106 in a staining volume of 100 μl.\n\t\nDilute PE conjugated mouse anti human VEGFR-3 (1:50); PE-Cy7 conjugated mouse anti human conjugated CD34 (1:200); APC-conjugated mouse anti human CD31 (1:100) and Alexa 488-conjugated rat anti human PODOPLANIN (1:200) in total volume of 100 μl sterile 5% FBS/PBS solution per tissue sample. Following preparation of antibody solution, keep on ice until use. Similarly prepare diluted isotype control antibody mixture to facilitate setting of flow cytometry gates.\nTo reduce nonspecific binding of the antibodies, centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 2 min, remove supernatant then suspend the cells in 100 μl sterile 5% FBS/PBS solution per sample to be stained. Incubate cells on ice for 20 min at 4 °C.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min, remove supernatant then re-suspend cells in the conjugated antibody cocktail. Also stain a smaller aliquot of cells (1 x 105) in 100 μl isotype control antibody mixture. Incubate cells on ice for 20 min.\nTo remove the unbound antibody, add 2 ml of 2% FBS/PBS solution and centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and repeat the wash.\nResuspend the cell pellet for the isotype control and the antibody stained sample to be sorted in 300 μl of 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide/2% FBS/PBS solution. Place tubes on ice until sorting.\n4. Cell Sorting\nUse the following materials to set up the instrument; alignment beads such as commercially available fluorescent particles, phosphate-buffered saline based sheath fluid and drop delay beads, such as Accudrop fluorescent beads.\nIsolate the purified human LECs on a multi-parameter fluorescence-activated cell sorting instrument. Set up the instrument and align as per manufacturer’s recommendations. In addition, run single stain compensation controls with each sort to generate the compensation matrix and to thus eliminate substantial bleed through of the emission of fluorochromes such as PE into the PE-Cy channel.\nNOTE: A higher proportion of the FACS sorted cells survive the isolation if a 100 μm nozzle is used and cells are sorted into endothelial cell medium.\n5. Cell Culture Post FACS Sorting\nFollowing sorting, centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 5-10 ml of media (depending on the flask used to seed the cell). If less than 50,000 cells are sorted, the cells are cultured in fibronectin coated 25 cm2 flask.",
    "Otherwise culture the cells in 75 cm2 fibronectin-coated flask at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, air humidified incubator. Change media after 2 days.\nNOTE: Cell media is changed every second day because prolonging the time between media changes appears to favor survival of the non-endothelial cells. We validate the lymphatic endothelial cell phenotype using immunohistochemical detection of markers: PROX-1, VEGFR-3, Podoplanin, CD34 and CD31 when the cells are first split for further expansion15.\nSubscription Required.
