  "procedures": [
    "1. Preparation of SurgiLux Solution\nPrepare a 2% (v/v) solution of acetic acid using deionized water in a clean glass beaker; use a laminar flow hood to avoid contamination.\nWeigh 0.02% (w/v) of the chromophore, indocyanine green, ICG, in a sterile Eppendorf tube; ensure the tube is wrapped in silver foil to prevent any light penetration.\nUsing a clean, disposable pipette, transfer approximately 1 ml of the dilute acetic acid solution to the tube to dissolve the dye, shake gently and keep wrapped in foil.\nTransfer the solubilized ICG into the beaker and add 2% (w/v) of chitosan powder before adding a sterile magnetic stirrer.\nCover the beaker with Parafilm then wrap in silver foil, before mixing the contents at about 125 rpm for 72 hr at room temperature in a laminar flow hood.\nTransfer the contents into clean centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 15 min at 4 Â°C to remove any particulate matter.\nCarefully transfer the green SurgiLux solution into a clean glass beaker, cover using Parafilm then wrap in silver foil, before storing in a refrigerator for 12 hr to increase the viscosity of the solution.\n2. Casting of SurgiLux Films\nUsing a sterile syringe, dispense 8 ml of the cold SurgiLux solution into a clean, Petri dish of 95 mm diameter, and gently tilt the plate to ensure complete coverage by the solution. Varying the ratio of solution volume to casting area permits control of the film thickness, see Figure 1.\nRemove any visible bubbles in the solution using the tip of a sterile needle. Cover the dish in silver foil and place in a refrigerator to remove any residual micron-sized bubbles.",
    "After 20 min carefully remove the Petri dish from the refrigerator, place in a laminar flow hood, cover with silver foil and leave the solution to evaporate for 3 weeks.\nAfter complete evaporation, score the outer edges of the clear green SurgiLux film in the Petri dish and gently 'peel' the film away from the dish surface.\nThe SurgiLux film should be flexible and readily manipulated without tearing or breaking.\nStore the circular SurgiLux films in the Petri dish wrapped in silver foil under dry conditions until ready for use.\n3. Laser Activation of SurgiLux Adhesive Films\nTo demonstrate the laser activation process we will use a piece of bovine tissue such as steak cut to a size of 15 mm wide and 20 mm length. Dissect the tissue in a straight line using a Number 10 surgical blade, to produce 2 pieces of 15 by 10 mm.\nApproximate the two pieces of tissue so that their edges are touching but not overlapping, and using a cotton swab or gauze, gently absorb any excess fluid.\nNext, cut a piece of SurgiLux film 7 x 9 mm and carefully place the film lengthways across the bisected piece of tissue; then press down gently with a dry cotton swab.\nSurgiLux films are activated using an infra-red diode laser at a setting of 120 mW. As this is a class IIIB laser, appropriate safety measures should be taken, including the use of appropriate safety glasses for all personnel.\nStarting in the corner, irradiate the SurgiLux with an infra-red laser set at 120 mW and a beam spot size of 1 mm diameter. Pass the beam spot over the green film at a rate of approximately 1 mm per second. Repeat the irradiation process two more times.\n4. Strength of the Repair",
    "Carefully secure the ends of the tissue in the clamps of a tensile testing instrument. We are using an Instron Mini55 system with a 50 Newton load cell. The maximum load, tensile strength, and extension at break were calculated using Bluehill computer software (USA). Means from at least 10 samples were determined (n = 10).\nTake up the 'slack' and then separate the tissue pieces at a rate of 1 mm per second, until the two pieces of tissue held together by the SurgiLux strip separate completely.\nSubscription Required.
