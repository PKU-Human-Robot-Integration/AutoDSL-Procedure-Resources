    "This procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02952768).\n1. Instrumentation\nUse a US machine equipped with a curvilinear 2–5 MHz probe. A portable US is more suitable for CPR.\n2. Personnel and their roles in the resuscitation team\nIdeally, a resuscitation team should be comprised of six members: 1) a leader; 2) a member for airway management (A) and ventilation (B); 3) one for chest compressions (C); 4) one for defibrillation (D); 5) one for intravenous (IV) catheterization and medication; and 6) a recorder.\nIf the personnel is limited, have the roles overlap. When US is integrated into the CPR process, the sonographer should be an independent member of the team who is well trained and experienced in resuscitation US and can intervene and interpret the US images in a timely manner without interrupting or delaying resuscitation efforts. However, the leader can also be the sonographer. He or she can use US to search for any potentially reversible causes of resuscitation failure as early as possible while leading the whole CPR process.\n3. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation process\nPerform all resuscitation procedures according to the ALS guidelines6.\nWhen US is integrated into the CPR process, strict control to minimize interruption of the chest compressions is the highest priority. Restrict the hands-off interval for pulse checks/rhythm analysis and simultaneous US evaluation to no longer than 10 s.\n\t\nUse a timer with preset alarms to remind the sonographer of the time intervals. Set the alarm for every 2 min of CPR and 10 s for pulse checks.\n4. US-CAB protocol\nUS-C: Use cardiac US (US-C) at the start of CPR and at the end of the first five cycles of chest compressions.",
    "Use the subxiphoid four-chamber view (Figure 1A) to check pericardial effusion, the size of the right and left ventricles, and sonographic cardiac activity.\nTurn the probe 90° (parallel to the long axis of the patient) to measure the diameter of the IVC (Figure 1B).\nUS-A: Use US-A to check the endotracheal tube location after intubation.\n\t\nPlace the probe transversely at the suprasternal notch (Figure 1C).\nNote the one air-mucosal interface with one comet-tail artifact (single tract sign) for tracheal intubation.\nMove the probe to the lateral side of the neck to reconfirm the single tract sign.\nPerform reintubation if there are two air-mucosal interfaces with two comet-tail artifacts (double tract sign)12.\nUS-B: Use US-B to check proper ventilation.\n\t\nPut the probe on either side of the chest at the 4th–5th intercostal spaces over the midaxillary line (Figure 1D).\nDetect lung sliding to evaluate pulmonary ventilation11,13.\nIf lung sliding is absent on one side, adjust the depth of the endotracheal tube until bilateral lung sliding is noticed.\nUS-C: Repeat US-C every 2 min when chest compression is stopped for pulse checks.\nRepeat US-AB after transportation and bed transfer of the patient.\n5. Settings and approach during CPR\nKeep the US machine ready in the resuscitation room of the emergency department. In cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest, a portable US device can be brought to the scene immediately, and turned on instantly.\nBecause a lot of resuscitation procedures are performed around the head, neck, and chest of the patient (e.g., chest compressions, defibrillation, intubation, ventilation, etc.), place the US machine in the caudal area of the patient (Figure 2). For example, it should be located over the patient’s right side for a right-handed sonographer and vice versa. This way the sonographer can get the probe ready and immediately assess the patient’s condition.",
    "6. Image acquisition and recording\nHave the US images interpreted by the sonographer and print or store important images for medical records and further discussion with the resuscitation team.\nIdeally, store the US images in the hard disk of the US machine for regular (e.g., monthly) review, either for quality assurance or teaching purposes. Video recording is even better, as it not only provides important information that is less well characterized by still photos but also offers materials for training or subsequent analysis.\n7. Data interpretation and analysis\nHave the sonographer interpret the US images during CPR on-site to help with clinical judgement and decision making. A sonographer, after structured training and continued practice, can perform sonographic evaluation and interpret the data in real CPR scenarios. The interpretation and discussion of the data can also be done by all resuscitation team members during debriefing immediately after the post-CPR phase. The discussion focuses not only on US diagnosis, but on the therapeutic interventions and impact on CPR outcomes following the US examination.\nFor research purposes, also have interpretation done afterwards by blinded researchers.\nSubscription Required.
