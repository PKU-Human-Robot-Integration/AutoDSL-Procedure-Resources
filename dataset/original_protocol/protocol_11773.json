    "Zebrafish maintenance was carried out as per the standard operating procedures approved by the Monash University Animal Ethics Committee under breeding colony license ERM14481.\n1. Determination of the genotype of live embryos using an embryo genotyping platform.\nAnesthetize 3 days post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish embryos by adding tricaine methanesulfonate to a final concentration of 0.016% (v/v) in embryo medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4 in water). Wait for 10 minutes to ensure that the fish are completely anesthetized, evident when the fish stop swimming.\nPrepare the 24 chamber DNA extraction chip by peeling the clear protective film from the top surface of the chip (Figure 1A).\nCut the tip of a 20 µL filter tip to widen the opening. Using this, pick a single embryo in a 13 µL volume of embryo medium and load into the first chamber of the chip. Repeat this process until embryos have been dispensed into each chamber.\n\tNOTE: This step should be performed in an area with minimal air drafts, as high air flow may cause excessive evaporation of the fluid subsequently resulting in reduced genotyping sensitivity and survival of the embryos.\nOnce the desired number of embryos have been loaded onto the DNA extraction chip, load it onto the zebrafish embryo genotyping platform. This is best achieved by placing in one side first, followed by the rest of it.\n\tNOTE: Avoid adding too much pressure onto the platform as this may overstress and damage the underlying springs.\nAffix the magnetic platform lid over the chip, which will prevent evaporation of embryo media during the DNA extraction protocol, and close the platform lid.",
    "Set the base unit to 2.4 volts, 0.051 A, and 0.12 W and start the DNA extraction protocol by pressing the \"ON/OFF\" button. The platform should start vibrating, which can be assessed by gently touching the lid. The protocol should be run for 8 minutes.\n\tNOTE: The vigorous vibration results in shedding of epidermal cells, from which genomic DNA is extracted.\nWhile the program is running, prepare a 24 well plate by adding 1 mL of embryo medium to each well, which is necessary to separate individual embryos while downstream genotyping assays are being performed.\nAdditionally, appropriately label 8 well strip tubes, which will be used for collection of DNA material from each embryo.\nAt the completion of the 8 minute protocol, press the ON/OFF button to stop the vibration of the platform.\nOpen the lid of the platform, and gently remove the magnetic lid ensuring minimal pressure is applied to the platform.\nCarefully remove the DNA extraction chip from the platform and place it on a flat surface.\nFrom the first chamber, remove 10 µL of embryo media surrounding the embryo and place it into the appropriate well of the 8-well strip tube. The media contains the genetic material from that embryo, which will be used for downstream assays.\n\tNOTE: Avoid touching the embryo with the pipette tip during media collection, as this can damage the embryo.\nUsing a plastic pipette, immediately add two drops of fresh embryo medium to the same chamber. Collect the embryo and move it to the first well of a 24 well plate.\nRepeat steps 1.12 and 1.13 for all the remaining chambers. At the completion of this, the 24 well plate containing live embryos can be moved to a 28 °C incubator.",
    "Perform appropriate downstream genotyping assays to determine the genotype of the embryos.\n\tNOTE: The DNA obtained from the embryo genotyping platform can be successfully amplified by PCR and can be used for subsequent analysis including sequencing, gel electrophoresis, or high-resolution melt-analysis14. To genotype the lama2 strain described in the representative results, PCR, restriction digestion and gel electrophoresis were used. Given that the concentration of DNA obtained from each embryo is low, it is suggested to utilise most, if not all, of the genetic material obtained for the downstream assay.\nOnce the genotype of each larvae has been identified, transfer them to 90 mm Petri dishes, placing each genotype in a different dish. Fill the dish with 25 mL embryo medium and keep them in the 28 °C incubator.\n2. Performing muscle injury using a needle stab\nOnce the larvae are 4 dpf, anesthetize them by adding tricaine methanesulfonate to a final concentration of 0.016% (v/v) in embryo medium. Wait for 10 minutes to ensure that the fish are completely anesthetized, evident when the fish stop swimming.\n\tNOTE: To avoid bias, the identity of the genotype should be blinded to the investigator performing the stabs and downstream analyses.\nDuring this time, prepare 24 well plates by filling each well with 1 mL of fresh embryo medium, and set up the stereomicroscope with a black background and high-power light, to facilitate the visualization of the somite borders.\nUsing a plastic pipette, transfer one anesthetized larva into a new Petri dish.\nCarefully remove excess embryo medium with a pipette, and under a dissecting microscope, orient the fish such that the head is on the left, tail on the right, dorsal region up and ventral region down (Figure 1B).",
    "Working under a dissecting microscope, use a 30-gauge needle to perform a quick but precise stab in the epaxial muscle located above the horizontal myoseptum. To ensure consistency in anterior-posterior position, aim for 1-2 somites located above the anal pore (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Avoid stabbing the neural tube and notochord, and work quickly to avoid the drying of the fish during the process.\nUsing a plastic pipette, pour a drop of embryo medium on the stabbed zebrafish and carefully transfer it into a well of the 24 well plate.\nRepeat steps 2.3 to 2.6. until all the fish have been stabbed.\n\t​NOTE: Several larvae can be stabbed together depending on the processing speed and proficiency of the investigator, as long as the fish do not dry out during the process.\nOnce all the larvae have been stabbed, place the 24 well plate in the 28 °C incubator until subsequent imaging is performed.\n3. Imaging of muscle injury and recovery\nAt 1 day post injury (1 dpi), anaesthetize the stabbed larvae by adding tricaine methanesulfonate to a final concentration of 0.016% (v/v) in embryo medium. Wait for 10 minutes to ensure that the fish are completely anesthetized, evident when the fish stop swimming.\n\tNOTE: At 0 dpi, the wound site contains a large amount of cellular debris, which makes it difficult to quantify the extent of muscle injury (Supplementary Figure 1A-B). It takes approximately 18-20 hours for this debris to be cleared from the wound site, and as such it is more reliable to image larvae at 1 dpi, rather than 0 dpi, to determine the extent of injury elicited.\nPlace a clean and empty glass bottom based dish on the stage of the polarizing microscope and set background using the integrated software.",
    "NOTE: Do not use plastic Petri dishes to image birefringence, as they do not appropriately transmit refracted light. Depending on the polarized microscope used, additional settings may be required as per the manufacturer's guidelines.\nHaving set the background, remove the glass bottom based dish from the microscope stage, and using a glass pipette, transfer the anesthetized, stabbed fish onto the glass bottom based dish.\nCarefully remove the excess of embryo medium using a pipette, and orient the fish as per 2.5 - the head is on the left, tail on the right, dorsal region up and ventral region down.\n\tNOTE: Ensure the larvae is mounted as flat as possible, as uneven mounting results in different birefringence intensities across different somites.\nPlace the glass bottom based dish with the anesthetized larvae on the microscope stage and image the muscle using polarized light (Figures 1C & 1D).\n\tNOTE: Depending on the type of microscope/polarized lens used, the fish orientation on its anterior-posterior axis can affect the overall birefringence15. Ensure to include at least 5 somites on either side of the injury site when imaging.\nUsing a plastic pipette, pour a drop of embryo medium to rehydrate the fish and place the fish in a well of a 24 well plate filled up with embryo medium.\n\tNOTE: It is important to perform the imaging as quickly as possible to prevent the fish from drying.\nRepeat steps 3.3. to 3.6. until all the fish have been imaged.\nWhen all images have been acquired, save them in .tiff format for subsequent analyses.\nPut the fish back into the 28 °C incubator until performing subsequent imaging at 3 dpi (7 dpf).\nWhen the fish are 3 dpi, image the fish as per 3.3 to 3.8.",
    "Once all fish have been imaged, euthanize them by adding tricaine methanesulfonate to a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v) in embryo medium. Wait for at least 10 minutes to ensure that the fish are euthanized, evident by the loss of swimming ability, pumping of the gill covers, and lack of a flight response following touch.\n4. Quantification of muscle regeneration\nOpen a 1 dpi image on an imaging analysis software such as the freely available Image J software.\nUsing the polygon tool, draw around the wound site, and measure the area and mean birefringence intensity of this region (Figures 1C & 1D). Copy these values to cells D3 and E3 in the template provided (Supplementary Table 1).\nDraw two additional regions, each spanning 1-2 uninjured somites, and measure the area and mean birefringence intensities of each of these regions (Figures 1C & 1D). Copy these values to cells D4-D5 and E4-E5 in the template provided (Supplementary Table 1).\n\tNOTE: While it is preferable to select the same uninjured somites in the 1 dpi and 3 dpi images, the sporadic detachment of muscle fibres and subsequent reduction in birefringence in mutants may make this impossible. Therefore, in the event the same somites cannot be selected at 1 dpi and 3 dpi due to the reduction in muscle integrity in mutants, select two different but unaffected areas at each of the timepoints.\nCalculate the normalized birefringence for each region by dividing the mean birefringence intensity of that region by the area - displayed in column F in the template provided (Supplementary Table 1).\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.4 for all 1 dpi and 3 dpi images.",
    "NOTE: When using the template provided (Supplementary Table 1), the 1 dpi area and mean birefringence intensity values should be inserted in columns D and E respectively, and the 3 dpi area and mean birefringence intensity values should be inserted in columns J and K respectively.\nFor each time point, calculate the average normalized birefringence of the two uninjured regions. This value provides a reference point of uninjured muscle.\n\tNOTE: In the template provided (Supplementary Table 1), this value is computed in columns G and M, for the 1 dpi and 3 dpi images respectively.\nNext, determine the extent of muscle injury at 1 dpi, by dividing the normalized birefringence of injury region by the average normalized birefringence of the uninjured regions (calculated in 4.6).\n\tNOTE: Using the above detailed needle stab procedure, wildtype larvae typically show a normalized birefringence of 48.5 ± 14.3% at the wound site at 1 dpi, indicating that the birefringence has reduced by approximately 50% when compared to uninjured somites. When using the template (Supplementary Table 1), this value is computed as a percentage in column H.\nTo determine the extent of muscle regeneration, divide the normalized birefringence of the injury region in the 3 dpi image, by the average normalized intensity of the uninjured regions at this stage.\n\tNOTE: At 3 dpi, wildtype larvae typically show a normalized birefringence of 60 ± 15.3% at the wound site. Given that the normalized birefringence within the wound site at 1 dpi was 48.5 ± 14.3% (step 4.7), the increase in birefringence at 3 dpi to 60 ± 15.3% indicates a recovery of approximately 11.5%. When using the template (Supplementary Table 1), this value is computed as a percentage in column N.",
    "Keeping fish within each genotype separate, perform a paired t-test comparing the normalized birefringence of the wound site at 3 dpi (step 4.8) with that of 1 dpi (step 4.7). This will reveal the trajectory of muscle regeneration displayed by each fish in each genotype, and highlight if the extent of muscle regeneration displayed by each genotype has significantly altered.\nFinally, calculate the regenerative index by dividing the value obtained in step 4.8, which is the extent of muscle regeneration at 3 dpi, by the value obtained in step 4.7, which is the extent of muscle injury at 1 dpi. A regenerative index of 1 indicates that the injury at 1 dpi is comparable to 3 dpi and that muscle regeneration has not occurred; a value above 1 indicates that at 3 dpi new muscle has formed in the wound site highlighting that the muscle has regenerated; and a regenerative index of less than 1 highlights that the wound at 3 dpi is worse than 1 dpi, and that muscle regeneration in impaired. A t-test or a one-way ANOVA can be performed to statistically compare the extent of muscle regeneration between the different genotypes. When using the template provided (Supplementary Table 1), this value is calculated in column O.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to perform the entire experiment in triplicates, with fish from each experiment obtained from different biological parents, and each experiment performed on different days, to avoid any bias.\nSubscription Required.
