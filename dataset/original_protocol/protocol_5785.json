    "Multichannel flow cytometry validation of immunohistochemistry (IHC) macrophage markersApproximately 3 g of human skeletal muscle tissue is cleaned from a patient’s hamstring tendon that is being utilized for ACL reconstruction surgery (performed in the operating room by trained medical personnel).Place skeletal muscle tissue in an ice bucket, on ice for transport back to the laboratory, then place inside a UV sterilized biosafety cabinet and perform all possible remaining steps inside the biosafety cabinet.Split the skeletal muscle specimen into multiple chunks as needed (1-2 g each) to allow for optimal tissue digestion.Isolate skeletal muscle mononuclear cells according to the established protocol referenced here (Liu et al., 2015).After obtaining a single cell suspension, centrifuge at 500 x g (rcf) (relative centrifugal force or g-force) for 5 min at 4 °C with gentle braking to pellet cells.Wash the cell pellet by resuspending with 1 ml sterile (autoclaved) 1x PBS, at this step, cell suspensions from multiple muscle chunks can be recombined back into one sample if desired.Repeat Step A5 to pellet cells and resuspend in 500 µl of fluorophore-conjugated antibody cocktail (Table 3).Mix well by pipetting up and down 6-8 times and incubate at 4 °C in the dark for 1 h.Centrifuge at 500 x g (rcf) for 5 min at 4 °C with gentle braking to pellet cells, then resuspend in sterile 1x PBS to wash.Repeat Step A9 for a second wash then resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml sterile 1x PBS for FACS.Store in an ice bucket, on ice until fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).Incubate 1 drop of UltraComp eBeads Compensation Beads with each individual antibody and follow the manufacturer’s protocol to set single channel compensation parameters for each fluorophore-conjugated antibody.An unstained sample of cell suspension should always be run to determine the location of negative cell populations (Liu et al.",
    ", 2015).Determine the dead cells by LIVE/DEAD Fixable blue staining and exclude them from analyses by gating on live cells only.Set a gate excluding doublets (Liu et al., 2015) using the forward scatter height (y-axis) and forward scatter area (x-axis).Isotype control antibodies in the appropriate fluorophores are used as a control to ensure antibody staining specificity (Table 3).FACS sort CD11b+/CD14+ cells for immunocytochemistry (ICC) and collect into 1x PBS.Following the sort, pellet cells by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspend in 600 µl of 1x PBS.Load 200 µl of cell suspension into a Shandon Single Cytofunnel and centrifuge with a Shandon Cytospin 4 at 1,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) for 3 min to place cells onto Shandon Single Cytoslides.Use PAP pen to trace the circle printed on the slide indicating where the sample is located and allow slides to air dry on the bench at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. Follow Steps C8-C22 of the CD11b/CD206 double IHC protocol below, replacing the primary antibody against CD11b with anti-CD68 (Step C20c) at a 1:100 dilution (Table 2).Following overnight (ON) incubation with primary anti-CD68 antibody and washes, incubate cells with ImmPRESS-AP, anti-mouse IgG (alkaline phosphatase) polymer detection kit for 1 h at RT, rocking (Table 2).Discard ImmPRESS-AP reagent and wash cells by pipetting 1x PBS into PAP pen circle, then rock for 5 min at RT. Repeat wash 3 more times for a total of 4 washes.Visualize CD68+ staining by adding alkaline phosphatase substrate using the ImmPACT Vector Red kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Table 2).Staining intensity can be monitored using a standard light microscope to determine the optimal amount of staining time; 10-20 min was found to be sufficient.",
    "Staining will be both chromogenic (appearing red) and fluorescent (visible using a TRITC filter cube).Repeat Step A18 (above) to wash and coverslip using 50% 1x PBS/50% glycerol.Image or store for up to a month at 4 °C in the dark (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180615/20180615012732_9876.jpgFigure 2. Validating CD11b as a pan-macrophage, cell surface marker in human skeletal muscle. A. Representative image showing IHC for the pan, intracellular macrophage marker, CD68 (green), with DAPI stained cell nuclei (blue) in human vastus lateralis muscle. Scale bar = 50 µm. B. Correlation of CD11b+ and CD68+ macrophage numbers, identified by IHC on consecutive sections from vastus lateralis muscle, n = 44 muscle samples analyzed. P value determined by Pearson’s correlation, r = Pearson’s correlation coefficient. C. CD14+/CD11b+ mononuclear cells (shown in Figure 1, panel A) were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and stained for CD68. Positive staining is both chromogenic (red when imaged with transmitted light, bright field, BF) and fluorescent (pseudocolored pink, FL). Left image: CD68 BF; positive staining is red. Right: CD68 FL, positive staining is pink. Cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue). D-E. High magnification images showing a CD68- event (D) and CD68+ cell (E) from panel C. CD68- events were small (< 10 µm) and did not appear to be monocytes/macrophages. CD68- structures appeared to stain with DAPI, suggesting that this may be cellular debris (cell nucleus without cytoplasm). Scale bars = 10 µm.Preparing IHC mounts from a Bergstrom needle human skeletal muscle biopsy (Tarnopolsky et al., 2011; Shanely et al., 2014)Note: This method is optional for preparing human skeletal muscle IHC mounts.Mix tragacanth gum powder and O.C.T compound with a Teflon coated spatula at a ratio of 1 part tragacanth gum powder to 1.5 parts O.C.T to make a thick paste (mounting medium).",
    "Apply mounting medium to cork and mold into a donut shape, leaving a hole in the center where the muscle specimen will be placed (Figure 3A).Following the skeletal muscle biopsy, remove the tissue from the Bergstrom needle and quickly identify skeletal muscle pieces free of fat and connective tissue.Gently separate individual pieces, choosing the largest intact pieces for IHC (~0.5-0.75 cm in length and 50-100 mg of total tissue). Trim any fat, connective tissue or accessory skeletal muscle fragments with a scalpel to clean the sample.Lay each skeletal muscle piece for IHC side by side lengthwise, with the edges on one end aligned (this will become the top of the IHC mount) and trim the other end with a #10 curved blade scalpel to align (bottom of IHC mount) (Figure 3B).Using fine-tipped forceps and the Teflon spatula, gently roll the skeletal muscle pieces together into a solid cylindrical shape (muscle cylinder).Roll the muscle cylinder onto the tip of the spatula so that the bottom (the edge you trimmed) is aligned with the tip of the spatula.Stand the muscle cylinder/spatula up so that skeletal muscle fibers are now running perpendicular to bench and the untrimmed, aligned edge (top) is facing up. Gently place the muscle cylinder into the center of the mounting medium donut, against one side of the donut and use forceps to push the muscle cylinder off of the spatula. Remove the spatula. The muscle cylinder is now perpendicular to the surface of the cork with the bottom, trimmed end on the cork and the long axis of the skeletal muscle fibers sticking up (Figure 3C).",
    "Using the spatula, work the mounting medium in to completely enclose the skeletal muscle specimen, closing gaps and leaving no air pockets between the muscle cylinder and the mounting medium (this protects the muscle specimen from freeze damage).Sculpt the top of the mounting medium so that it is flush with the top of the skeletal muscle specimen.Rapidly freeze the IHC mount by placing into liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane for 2 min.Isopentane should be a slushy consistency, with solid just beginning to form.The cork side of the mount should be facing up and the skeletal muscle specimen facing down, completely submerged in the cooled isopentane.Once frozen, use tongs to remove the IHC mount from the cooled isopentane and place on dry ice to rest for 5 min.The final IHC mount is now ready to be stored at -80 °C until you are ready to section (Figures 3D-3E).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180615/20180615013203_6981.jpgFigure 3.

Set the chamber temperature in the cryostat to -25 °C and place the IHC mount into the cryostat chamber.",
    "Adhere the IHC mount to a chuck by covering the top of the chuck with O.C.T Compound, setting the cork into the O.C.T using forceps and allowing the O.C.T to harden by freezing. Allow the IHC mount to acclimate to the temperature of the chamber for 1 h prior to sectioning. The chamber temperature may need to be adjusted for each sample in order to achieve flat sections with the greatest number of fibers in cross-section.Cross-section frozen muscle mounts with the cryostat stage angle between 8° and 10°.The stage angle may also need adjusted for some samples; however, this is less common and stage angles outside of this range are not recommended. Sample should be adjusted so the top of the mount is perpendicular to the blade when sectioning. In order to obtain cross-sectional fibers, small adjustments in the angle of the chuck/mount may need to be made. Once adjustments are made, quality sections should be cut containing at least 100 muscle fibers and no more than 20% longitudinal fibers.Using the anti-roll plate to keep sections from curling, cut frozen sections at 7 µm and pick up onto charged Superfrost Plus slides.Allow sections to dry on the benchtop at RT, then circle samples to be stained using an ImmEdge PAP pen.Allow PAP pen to dry for an additional 20-30 min.Fix sections at -20 °C for 3 min by submerging slides in a Coplin jar containing ice cold acetone. Acetone should be stored at -20 °C to maintain temperature. Quickly dab slide edges onto a paper towel to drain excess acetone and transfer to a Coplin jar filled with 1x PBS at RT.Rock the slides in 1x PBS for 5 min; repeat wash step two more times for a total of three washes.",
    "Remove slides from Coplin jar, gently flick to remove excess 1x PBS, wipe the back of the slide with a paper towel and place into a humidifying slide chamber containing approximately 1.5 cm of water in the reservoir.Block endogenous peroxidases by pipetting 3% hydrogen peroxide onto the sections and allow to incubate, rocking at RT for 8 min.Gently dump the hydrogen peroxide onto a paper towel to discard, replace with 1x PBS and rock for 5 min at RT.Repeat Step C13 two more times for a total of three washes.Dump excess 1x PBS onto a paper towel, flick slide, wipe the back with a paper towel and place back in the slide chamber.Perform Streptavidin/Biotin blocking using the kit per the manufacturer’s instructions, carrying out all incubations in the humidifying slide chamber:Incubate sections with Streptavidin blocking solution for 15 min at RT.Wash briefly: two times, 2 min with 1x PBS.Incubate sections with Biotin blocking solution for 15 min at RT.Remove biotin blocking solution and replace with 1x PBS and incubate for 5 min, at RT, rocking. Repeat this wash with 1x PBS a total of three times.Dump 1x PBS onto a paper towel, flick slide to remove excess 1x PBS, wipe the back of the slide with a paper towel and return to the slide chamber.Add enough volume of 2.5% normal horse serum (NHS) to completely cover the sections and rock at 4 °C, overnight.Remove 2.5% NHS, gently dab PAP pen with a kimwipe to re-establish hydrophobic barrier, add the primary antibody for CD11b, diluted 1:100 in 2.5% NHS, and return to the rocker at 4 °C overnight.",
    "To ensure the specificity of the primary antibody against CD11b, an isotype specific control should also be prepared by adding purified mouse IgG1, κ to a section at the same concentration as the primary antibody against CD11b (0.1 mg/ml). The isotype control listed in Table 2 has a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and should be diluted 1:500 in 2.5% NHS and incubated overnight at 4 °C, rocking (Figure 4A). To determine signal produced by background staining of the tissue specimen, a no primary antibody control should be included. Prepare the no primary antibody control by covering the section in 2.5% NHS alone (omitting any antibody) and incubating overnight at 4 °C, rocking (Figure 4B).For identification of macrophages using CD68, substitute anti-CD68 primary antibody, diluted 1:100, for primary antibody against CD11b in this step (Table 2) (Figure 2A).For identification of specific M2 macrophage populations, substitute anti-CD163 primary antibody, diluted 1:50, for anti-CD11b primary antibody in this step and continue with the staining protocol as written (Table 2).For identification of satellite cell populations, anti-Pax7 antibody, diluted 1:100, should be substituted for primary antibody against CD11b at this step (Table 2).Remove primary antibody from sections and wash (as outlined in Step C17 above) four times, 5 min with 1x PBS, rocking at RT.Dump excess 1x PBS onto a paper towel, flick to remove remaining 1x PBS, wipe the back of the slide with a paper towel, return to the slide chamber.Add the biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG1, diluted 1:1,000 in 2.5% NHS, and incubate by rocking for 90 min at RT. Remove the biotinylated antibody from the sections and repeat the wash in Steps C21 and C22.Add the SA-HRP, diluted 1:500 in 1x PBS, and incubate for 60 min, rocking at RT.",
    "Remove the SA-HRP from the sections and wash three times, 5 min with 1x PBS, rocking at RT.After the third wash, repeat Step C22 then add TSA 488, diluted 1:500 in 1x PBS, and incubate for 20 min, rocking at RT.Remove the TSA 488 and repeat the washes in Step C26.Repeat Steps C15-C18 to block the streptavidin and biotin used to label CD11b and prevent false co-staining.Add enough volume of 2.5% NHS to completely cover the sections and rock at RT for at least 60 min (sections can be left in 2.5% NHS longer if desired).Remove 2.5% NHS, gently dab the PAP pen with a Kimwipe to re-establish the hydrophobic barrier, add the primary antibody for CD206, diluted 1:200 in 2.5% NHS, then return the slide chamber to the rocker at 4 °C overnight.To determine signal produced by background staining of the tissue specimen, a no primary antibody control should be included at this step also. Prepare the no primary antibody control by covering the section in 2.5% NHS alone (omitting any antibody) and incubating overnight at 4 °C, rocking (Figure 4C).Remove CD206 antibody from sections and repeat Steps C21 and C22 to wash.Add biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG, diluted 1:500 in 2.5% NHS, and incubate for 90 min at RT, rocking.Remove the biotin from the sections and wash four times, 5 min with 1x PBS, rocking at RT.Add the SA-594, diluted 1:200 in 1x PBS, and incubate for 60 min, rocking at RT.Remove the SA-594 from the sections and wash three times, 5 min with 1x PBS, rocking at RT.Incubate sections with DAPI, diluted 1:10,000 in 1x PBS, for 10 min at RT, rocking.Remove DAPI from the sections and wash three times, 5 min with 1x PBS.",
    "Dump excess 1x PBS onto a paper towel and add enough volume of PBS/Glycerol or Vectashield mounting medium to cover the sections (20-50 µl/slide).Gently lower coverslip onto the slide, avoiding the formation of bubbles under the coverslip. Allow the mounting medium to spread by leaving the slides laying coverslip up for 5-10 min.Drain excess mounting medium from slides by standing vertical on a paper towel for 5 min.Image muscle sections or store slides at 4 °C protected from light until ready to image. Staining will last for several months if slides are stored properly at 4 °C, in the dark.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180615/20180615014243_2236.jpgFigure 4. Immunohistochemical controls validating the specificity of CD11b and CD206 staining. Representative images of staining controls. A) No primary antibody for CD206, B) Isotype control antibody for CD11b and C) No primary antibody for either CD11b or CD206. CD11b (green), CD206 (red) and cell nuclei/DAPI (blue). Scale bars = 100 µm. All images were acquired on serial sections from the same sample with a 20x objective using the same exposure settings. The same display adjustment was applied across all images. A. Images showing a lack of CD206 staining when the primary antibody for CD206 is not applied to the sections. This control shows the specificity of the CD206 antibody; staining is not a product of cross reactivity with reagents used to amplify CD11b or due to non-specific tissue staining. B. Lack of CD11b+ staining when an isotype control antibody is applied. Similar to panel A, this control shows the specificity of the CD11b antibody since the isotype-matched control does not produce non-specific staining. Additionally, this control shows that CD206 staining does not result from cross reactivity to CD11b reagents since no CD11b staining is present but CD206+ cells are clearly identified. C.",
    "Images show very low non-specific background staining of skeletal muscle tissue sections from the use of amplification reagents; thus positive macrophage staining can clearly be distinguished from tissue background."
