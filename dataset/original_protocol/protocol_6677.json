    "Seed 20 175 cm2 flasks with 1,000 Acanthamoeba castellanii cells per cm2 in 20 ml of PPYG medium. Incubate at 32 °C for two days.Note: You can add ampicillin and kanamycin at final concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml and 0.025 mg/ml, respectively, in each flask to avoid bacterial contamination. After two days, the cell confluence should be between 130,000 and 180,000 cells/cm2. Infect the cells with a Mimivirus stock at a multiplicity of infection of 0.2.Incubate at 32 °C for two days or until cell lysis is complete.Note: There is no need to change the medium before infection or to remove the virus from the flasks. Harvest the cell debris-containing supernatants from the flasks and pool them into 50 ml conical tubes. Note: For 20 175 cm2 flasks containing 20 ml of medium you will need 7 tubes.  Centrifuge at 500 x g for 10 min at room temperature (~25 °C, RT) to remove the cell debris.Decant the supernatant into new 50 conical tubes.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 25 min at RT to pellet the virus.Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the resulting virus pellets in 10 ml K36 buffer by pipeting and pool in two new 50 ml conical tubes (35 ml per tube). Complete the volume to 50 ml with K36 buffer.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 25 min at RT to pellet the virus.During the centrifugation, prepare four CsCl gradients in Beckman polyallomer tubes. Add 7.5 ml of CsCl solution density 1.5 g/cm3 at the bottom of each tube, then carefully overlay with 9 ml of 1.4 g/cm3 CsCl solution and 9 ml of 1.3 g/cm3 CsCl solution, dropwise. Hold for the final virus-containing 1.2 g/cm3 density layer.Discard the supernatant from the centrifugation in Step 9.Resuspend the two viral pellets with 16 ml of 1.",
    "2 g/cm3 CsCl solution for each pellet by pipeting.Overlay 8 ml of resuspended virus pellets on top of each of the four gradients, dropwise (Figure1A).Centrifuge overnight (between 16 and 18 h) at 100,000 x g at 20 °C in a Beckman Coulter  JS24-38  rotor.After centrifugation, harvest the white ring corresponding to the virus fraction (Figure 1B) by carefully pipetting through the gradient or by puncturing the polyallomer tube and aspirating with a needle and a syringe (Figure 2). Transfer the virus fraction to two new 50 ml conical tubes, add K36 buffer up to 50 ml in each tube and mix by inverting the tubes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3827/bioprotoc-10-22-3827-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Collection of the viral fraction by side puncture Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 25 min at RT to pellet the virus.Resuspend the two pellets with 10 ml of K36 buffer each, complete the volume to 50 ml with K36 and centrifuge them at 10,000 x g for 25 min at RT to wash the virus.Repeat Steps 16 and 17 twice. For the last wash, pool the resuspended virus in a single 50 ml conical tube.Resuspend the final pellet in 10 ml of K36 buffer.The virus is ready to be titrated or stored at -80 °C until further use.Notes: Typically, when purifying Acanthamoeba polyphaga Mimivirus using that protocol, we recover 10 ml of viral solution containing 1 x 1010 to 4 x 1010 particles/ml.  The purified particles are infectious and can be used to performed new infections or any other experiments."
