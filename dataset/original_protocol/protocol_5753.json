    "Optimization of seeding densityIn an initial experiment, the optimal seeding density is required for each cell type. Typically, the cell density ranges from 10,000 to 60,000 cells per well and can vary widely among cell lines. A first point of orientation can be the cell number that gives confluency of approx. 95% overnight in a 96-well cell culture plate as the seeding surface is comparable to the seahorse culture plate. The seeding number should give a confluent and healthy and consistent monolayer on the day of the assay.HCT-116, SK-Mel-5 and SK-Mel-28 cells were seeded in a Seahorse XF24 cell culture plate at various concentrations ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 cells/well with a two-step seeding technique as described below in Procedure B (Figure 2). Seeding cells in triplicates is recommended.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515015917_2860.jpgFigure 2. Plate layout for cell density evaluation. Shown here is the exemplary seeding layout for the SK-Mel-5 and SK-Mel-28 cell lines (seeding density for HCT-116 cells was evaluated on a second plate; not shown).Cells were then assayed in the XF24 instrument as described in Procedure E (without loading compounds into ports) using Table 1 commands.Table 1. Protocol commands for cell density evaluationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515020211_7559.jpgAs seen in Figure 3, a linear increase of OCR values with increasing cell density was observed in all three cell lines. ECAR values begin to level off at 20,000 cells/well for SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-5 while being much lower and steadily increasing for HCT-116. Thus, a seeding number of 20,000 cells/well for SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-5 and of 35,000 cells/well for HCT-116 were chosen to ensure being within the linear response range while having high reading values to observe increases as well as decreases in OCR and ECAR.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515020323_4688.jpgFigure 3.",
    "Optimization of assay conditions: evaluation of OCR and ECAR depending on the seeding density of three different cell linesSeeding cells into Seahorse XF24 tissue culture plate (Day 1)Note: The seeding and growing of cells are performed with good sterile cell culture technique. A two-step seeding method is used to obtain a consistent even monolayer which is vital to obtain consistent and accurate data:Pre-warm culture media, trypsin solution and DPBS to 37 °C.For adherent cells, wash cells with DPBS, and add trypsin and wait until cells begin to detach. Add culture media with serum to deactivate trypsin and pipette up and down to create a uniform cell suspension. Count cells with a hemocytometer and resuspend cells in growth media to the desired final concentration to seed in 100 µl.Plate 100 µl cell suspension into a Seahorse XF24 tissue culture plate. Put media only (no cells) in the background correction wells (A1, B4, C3, D6).Let the culture plate sit for 1 h in the bio-hood without moving it around (in order to let cells settle evenly).Place the culture plate into an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 4 h.Carefully add 150 µl growth media (final volume in well 250 µl). Hold the pipette tip at an angle and add to the well side to not destroy even layer of newly attached cells. Let cells grow overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Note: The following steps are performed without sterile technique, but caution to keep the cells and equipment as clean as possible.  Hydrate sensors (Day 1)Open XF 24 FluxPak and take out the sensor cartridge (green) and calibration plate (clear) (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515020741_9946.jpgFigure 4. Seahorse XF 24 sensor cartridge. A. The sensor cartridge sitting on top of a calibration plate with injection ports shown. B.",
    "Bottom side of the sensor plate which shows sensors with embedded fluorophores.Place the sensor cartridge (sensors up) next to the calibration plate (be careful not to touch sensors).Fill each well of the calibration plate with 1 ml of Seahorse XF Calibrant.Lower the sensor cartridge onto the calibrant plate submerging the sensors in calibrant (be careful not to touch walls with sensors). Place in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator overnight. To prevent evaporation of the XF Calibrant, verify that the incubator is properly humidified.Stabilization of instrument (Day 1)Turn on an XF24 Analyzer, open Seahorse Bioscience software and log in.Write the assay template. When planning and writing the assay protocol be careful not to create a protocol that is longer than cells can manage without CO2 in unbuffered media. Depending on cell type this is 2-3 h. If in doubt, a cell viability assay can be performed after the seahorse assay.Leave the XF24 Analyzer on overnight with XF24 software running and logged in to ensure equilibration to 37 °C.Seahorse assay (Day 2)Check on the confluency of cells. Evenly spacing of cells is needed, without large cell clumps or blank patches, as this could impair the accuracy of data.Pre-warm assay media to 37 °C.Pre-warm compounds and adjust to pH 7.4 with NaOH (1 M) if necessary.Perform media exchange in a Seahorse XF24 tissue culture plate:Remove 150 µl growth media with a multichannel pipet.Add 1 ml assay media with a multichannel pipette.Remove 1 ml with a multichannel pipette.Add 475 µl assay media with a multichannel pipette (575 µl final volume).Place the cell plate into a CO2-free incubator for approx. 60 min.Load cartridge with desired compounds:Pre-warm compounds to 37 °C.",
    "Load 50-100 µl of compound into appropriate port of cartridge (for mitochondrial stress test: 64 µl into port A, 71 µl port B, 79 µl port C, 88 µl port D). (see Note 1) Load equivalent amounts of assay media into equivalent port for background wells (see Note 2).Place back into the incubator (non-CO2) for 10 min to allow heating up to 37 °C again. Handle carefully, carry only by holding onto the calibration plate. Move as less as possible.Calibration and running seahorse assay:Load assay template in Seahorse XF24 software.Press green ‘START’ button.Make sure to load the correct protocol, the correct save directory and saving name.Press ‘START’.Load sensor cartridge with calibration plate into instrument tray (the notch goes in the front, left corner. Make sure that the plate sits correctly and flat, between all 8 tabs)Follow the instructions on the screen in order to calibrate and equilibrate sensors.Once equilibration step is done, remove the calibration plate and replace with cell culture plate.Protocol commands (mitochondria stress test, Table 2, Figure 5)Table 2.
