    "1. Isolation of Brain Microvessels\nFor each preparation use five to ten neonatal mice of either sex (3-5 days old).\nEuthanize a mouse according to local IACUC/veterinarian recommendations, remove the brain immediately, and transfer into a Petri dish containing the following solution: 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 153 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 2.3 mM CaCl2x 2H2O, 2.6 mM MgCl2x 6H2O, 1% (w/v) BSA (hereafter referred to as buffer A).\nUnless otherwise indicated, all isolation procedures should be performed at room temperature (RT) (22-24 °C) under the laminar flow hood. Cut the brains (cerebrum without cerebellum and brain stem), after removal of the meninges and capillary fragments, in buffer A using a sterile scalpel. Pipette the tissue fragments up and down using a 10 ml pipette until no clumps appear. Transfer the suspension into a 50 ml Falcon tube and centrifuge at 250 x g for 5 min at RT.\nNote: Meninges can be identified as thin, transparent membranes at the surface of the brain tissue. They can be carefully removed with sterile forceps.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nDissolve the pellet in 4.5 ml Buffer A with 1.5 ml of 0.75% (w/v) collagenase/ dispase (Roche) and incubate for 45 min at 37 °C in a water bath (occasionally shaking).\nMeanwhile, prepare the 12-well plates by coating four wells with collagen IV (0.1 mg/ml dissolved in 50 mM acetic acid). Allow to adhere for 1 hr.\nStop the digestion by addition of 15 ml ice-cold buffer A. Resuspend the pellet thoroughly.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 250 x g for 10 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant.",
    "To remove myelin, add 10 ml 25% (w/v) BSA (Sigma, purity > 98%) and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. 25% BSA should be dissolved in 1x PBS (PAA Laboratories) and filtered through 0.2 μm filter).\nCarefully discard the supernatant, dissolve the pellet in 10 ml Buffer A and transfer to a new Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at RT. The resulting pellet contains the endothelial cells.\nWash twice the collagen IV- coated 12-well plate with PBS.\nResuspend the pellet in 4 ml of growth medium (DMEM containing 10% FCS, 50U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine) and plate the cell suspension into two wells, 2 ml to each well. Add the puromycin to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml and incubate for 45 min at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. This step allows removal of rapidly adhering cells. Note: Puromycin is added for 24 hr. Only brain ECs can metabolize it, for other cell types puromycin is toxic 14.\nTransfer the 2 ml medium containing non-adhered cells from step 1.14 into two fresh wells (these wells contain the EC fraction). Fill up the wells with adhered cells from step 1.14 with 2 ml fresh medium (these wells contain other cell types, e.g. fibroblasts, astrocytes and can be grown in parallel and used for comparisons of the morphology).\nChange the medium the following day.\n2. Immortalizing the Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells",
    "Cultivate the GP + E-86 Neo (GPENeo) 15 fibroblasts, secreting a replication-deficient virus with polyoma middle T oncogene in DMEM medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 50U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mg/ml G418 (PAA Laboratories) in gelatine coated flasks. Note: Polyoma middle T oncogene transfection causes growth advantage of ECs over non-ECs leading to a homogenous monolayer of cells with endothelial morphology 4 to 6 weeks of culture. GPENeo are not commercially available and can be obtained as shared public material (please refer to original publications 4,16).\nTo use the virus-containing medium for immortalization, cultivate the GPENeo cells in G418- free medium for 24 h.\nRemove 10 ml of the GPEneo supernatant and add Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide) (Sigma) to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml, sterilize through 0.45 μm filter to remove the cellular fragments.\nRemove the growth medium from the EC cultures prepared in Part 1 and add 2 ml of GPEneo supernatant/Polybrene mixture into the wells. Repeat it the next day using a fresh GPEneo supernatant/Polybrene mixture. Note: Polybrene is used to make pores in the cell wall to facilitate the infection with the viral particles).\nRemove the GPEneo supernatant/Polybrene mixture the following day, wash the cells twice with PBS and maintain the cells in the growth medium changing it every 3 days. Upon confluence, split the cells 1:2 on collagen IV-coated plates.\nTypically, stable cerebral endothelial (cEND) cell lines should be obtained 4-5 weeks later.\n3. Cultivating the Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells\nThaw the cells from cryoaliquot in water bath and transfer in 15 ml-Falcon with 10 ml pre-warmed medium.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at RT.",
    "Remove medium, transfer the pellet in the collagen IV coated T25 cm2 cell culture flask with pre-warmed growth medium (cell density for plating should be at least 1x 104 cells/ml).\nChange medium the next day and after the cells reached confluence (usually after 5 days) split the cells.\n4. Splitting of cEND-cells (Note: Splitting Should be Done Only Once a Week, Avoid Splitting Higher than 1:4).\nRemove medium, wash the cells with PBS.\nAdd 3 ml of warm trypsin-EDTA solution (PAA Laboratories) (T75 cm2 flask), incubate at 37 °C and wait until cells layer is dispersed (usually within 5 to 15 min).\nAdd 5 ml of growth medium, pipette up and down, and transfer to a new collagen IV-coated flask.\n5. Freezing of cEND-cells\nObtain the cell suspension as described in step 4\nCentrifuge the suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at RT.\nResuspend the cell pellet (obtained from 1 T75 cm2 flask) in 6 ml freezing medium (95% growth medium, 5% DMSO).\nDivide the cell suspension into four 1.5 ml cryo-aliquots. Note: One cryo-aliquot can be seeded on T25 cm2 flask.\nStore the cryo-aliquots under liquid nitrogen vapor temperature.\ncEND growth medium: 450 ml DMEM, 10% FCS, 10 ml L-glutamine, 2% MEM-Kit, 2% NEAA, 10 ml natrium pyruvate, 50 U/ml penicillin/ streptomycin\n6. Representative Results",
    "The cEND and cerebEND cells were characterized by immunostainings of endothelial and BBB markers as well as by measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and permeability. The cEND and cerebEND had a morphology similar to primary cultures of brain ECs, with monolayers of tightly packed elongated cells that exhibited growth inhibition at confluence. The cells expressed well detectable levels of claudin-5, occludin and VE-cadherin proteins which were localized at the cell-cell junctions, as shown by immunofluorescence (Figure 3) 4,5. Culturing cEND cells in serum-reduced medium led to an increase in TEER (from 150 Ωcm2 in the presence of 10% serum to 500 Ωcm2 in the presence of 2% serum), which was potentiated by the addition of hydrocortisone (800 Ωcm2) or insulin (1,000 Ωcm2)4. Monolayers of cEND cultured in serum-reduced medium for 21 days had TEER of 900 Ωcm2 (Figure 4). TEER was measured using an assembly containing current-passing and voltage-measuring electrodes (World Precision Instruments). For comparison, the primary microvascular brain ECs has been reported to have TEER values of 200-600 Ωcm2 and a commercially available mouse cell line bEnd.3 had TEER values of 100-140 Ωcm2 (for recent review see Abbot 2005 and Toth et al., 2011 17,18). In addition, the passage of macromolecules, such as non-charged FITC-dextrans of molecular masses 4, 10, 70 and 500 kDa, or fluorescein (300 Da) across the monolayer of cEND in 2% FCS differentiation medium over 4 hr was decreased compared with control cells maintained in growth medium containing 10% FCS: paracellular flux was reduced to 30% of control cells for fluorescein, to 26% for FITC-dextrans 10 and 70 kDa, and flux was reduced to 4.5% of control cells for FITC-dextrtan 500 kDa. Similar to TEER values, the permeability was at the lowest level in the cells cultured in the presence of glucocorticoids (GC) 4.",
    "In further studies, we identified the glucocorticoid target genes, occludin, claudin-5 and VE-cadherin in brain vascular endothelium 4,7,9. GC treatment led to an increase in the expression of these proteins and to the rearrangement of VE-cadherin to the cytoskeleton. The direct GC-mediated regulation of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-5 appears through GC response elements in their promoter regions 4,7,19. Additionally, claudin-5 was identified as a novel estrogen target in vascular endothelium 10.",
    "Endothelial dysfunction underlies many different diseases. We cultured the cEND under oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. OGD led to the disruption of the BBB function, which could be reconstituted after combined treatment with GC and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib 12. OGD conditions led to a strong increase in glucose uptake and in the expression of glucose transporters in cerebEND, which could be attenuated by the addition of MK801, a non-competitive inhibitor of the NMDA-receptor 13.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4022/4022fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
