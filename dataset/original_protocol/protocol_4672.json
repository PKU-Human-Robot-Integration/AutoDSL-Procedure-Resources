    "Sensor designFor yeast expression, CHL1/NRT1.1 or PTRs coding regions were inserted by Gateway LR reactions into the E.coli/yeast expression vectors pDRFlip30, a destination vector that sandwiches the sensory domain between Aphrodite t9 and mCerulean (Jones et al., 2014), following manufacturer’s instructions. The E. coli/yeast vector pDRFlip30 is used for expressing the NiTracs or PepTracs from a PMA1 (yeast proton ATPase) promoter fragment. pDRFlip30 contains the ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) terminator, and the URA3 marker for auxotrophy selection in yeast (Figure 1). pDRFlip30 is a vector that allows us to sandwich the transporter of interest by translational fusion between an N-terminal Aphrodite t9 (AFPt9) variant (aphrodite is a codon-diversified gene producing Venus; Deuschle et al., 2006), lacking nine amino acids at its C-terminus and a C-terminal monomeric Cerulean (mCer; Rizzo et al., 2006).Yeast transformationThe protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5465 [MATa ura3­52 trp1 leu2­Δ1 his3­Δ 200 pep4::HIS3 prb1­Δ1.6R can1 GAL] is transformed with the pDRFlip30 vector containing the desired NiTracs and PepTracs by using the modified Lithium Acetate method from Gietz et al., 1992. In brief:Inoculate cultures in YPD medium and grow at 30 °C overnight to OD600nm ~ 0.5.Spin down (2,000 x g) 1 ml of cells in microfuge tube (15 sec) for each transformation.Decant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100 μl of liquid medium by vortexing. Add 2 μl of 10 mg/ml carrier DNA, vortex.Add ~1 μg plasmid, vortex.Add 20 μl 1 M DTT, vortex.Add 0.5 ml of ‘PLATE mixture’ (100 ml stock containing 90 ml of 45% PEG4000, 10 ml of 1 M lithium acetate, 1 ml of 1 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.2 ml of 0.5 M EDTA), vortex.Incubate at RT for 6-8 h or overnight.Heat-shock cells for 10 min at 42 °C.",
    "Place pipet tip directly into bottom of tube, withdraw 50-100 μl of cells and plate cells on solid -ura DropOut medium. Plates are wrapped with plastic cling wrap to prevent dehydration. Plates are incubated (lid down) at 30 °C for 2-3 days.Detection of NiTrac and PepTrac responses in yeast using a fluorimeterSingle colonies are picked using sterile pipette tips and grown in a 50 ml tube containing 10 ml -ura DropOut liquid medium. Pick at least three independent colonies. Use fresh transformation; do not keep colonies for more than one week on plates to avoid mutations in yeast or plasmid.Place tubes in a rack and incubate in an incubator for ~15 h under agitation (230 rpm) at 30 °C until the culture reaches OD600nm ~0.5.Liquid cultures are subcultured after dilution to OD600nm 0.01 in the same liquid medium and grown at 30 °C until OD600nm reaches ~0.2. Collect the cells by centrifugation at 4,000 x g, RT for 7 min, to sediment the cells.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the sediment by vortexing in 10 ml ‘Wash buffer’, 15 sec, RT. Centrifuge as described above (step B4).Wash the sediment two more times as in step B4 to B6, to remove traces of growth medium.Resuspend the sediment to OD600nm ~0.5 in ‘Resuspension buffer’.Mix cells well and aliquot 100 µl of the culture into wells of a 96-well flat bottom plate. Fluorescence is measured in a fluorescence plate reader, in bottom reading mode using 7.5 nm bandwidth for both excitation and emission. Typically, emission spectra are recorded with the following instrument settings: λem 470-570 nm for donor (mCer), step size 5 nm, gain: 75; and λem 520-570 nm for AFPt9, step size 5 nm, gain: 75.",
    "Fluorescence from cultures harboring pDRFlip30 (donor: mCer) is measured with excitation at λexc 428 nm; AFPt9 is measured with excitation at λexc 500 nm.A single- or multichannel pipette is used to add 100 µl of the culture to wells (mix by pipetting up and down) and to add analyte solution to the cells. Set up at least three replicates per treatment. Try to add equal amounts of solutions to reduce variability and use well-calibrated pipettes since the assays are quantitative and sensitive to differences in volumes/ concentration of sensor and analyte.Record the fluorescence immediately (as fast as possible) after substrate or control solution addition. It takes about 10 min to read a full 96 well plate with the parameters mentioned above. For highly accurate analyses, measure only a few wells at a time to reduce differences in analysis time. It is also possible to use instruments with injectors that allow for immediate recording; use rapid switching between wells to record over time."
