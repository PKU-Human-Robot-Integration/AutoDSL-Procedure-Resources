    "T cell and APC Culture (Ambler et al., 2017)T cell culture: Cull a 5C.C7 T cell receptor transgenic mouse over 6-week-old using approved procedures such as those listed in Schedule One of the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. All animal breeding, maintenance and handling needs to be approved by the appropriate authorities.Dissect lymph nodes and collect them in a 15 ml Falcon tube containing 5 ml of complete medium.Place a 40 µm cell strainer over a 50 ml Falcon tube. Pour all lymph nodes onto the cell strainer and mechanically dissociate lymph nodes by gently forcing through the filter once using a 1 ml syringe plunger. Wash the plunger and cell strainer using 5 ml of complete medium.Centrifuge the cells for 3 min at 200 x g. Remove supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of complete medium and count the cells.Dilute cells to a density of 4 x 106 cells/ml.Culture 1 ml of cell suspension in one well of a 24-well plate and add 0.65 µl of 5 mM MCC peptide to achieve a final MCC concentration of 3 µM. Incubate at 37 °C, 6% CO2 overnight.Split 5C.C7 T cells with interleukin-2 medium as necessary, usually 1:1 every day. The MCC peptide is only used to prime the culture. T cell maintenance is achieved using interleukin-2.Experiments need to be repeated with at least two independent primary T cell cultures.APC culture: CH27 B cell lymphoma cells are used as antigen presenting cells and are maintained in complete medium by splitting 1:10 every two days.T cell stimulation using PervanadateAs a positive control, T cells can be stimulated with the phosphatase inhibitor Pervanadate to induce generalized and extensive tyrosine phosphorylation.",
    "On day 5 of T cell culture, collect T cells from as many wells of the 24-well plate as needed (4 x 106 cells/well) into a 15 ml Falcon tube, centrifuge at 200 x g for 3 min. Resuspend T cell pellet in 150 µl of imaging buffer per well.Count T cells and collect required cell number (40,000 per experimental replicate) in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Add freshly prepared 2x pervanadate at a ratio of 1:1 to cells with complete medium in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Incubate for 5 min at 37 °C and stain (Procedure D).Coating of STED compatible coverslipsWash STED compatible coverslips (high performance, thickness no. 1.5, 0.170 ± 0.005 mm, Zeiss) with 10% SDS for 10 min followed by one wash with ddH2O.Submerge the washed coverslips in 100% ethanol for 30 min in a Petri dish.Wash the coverslips once with ddH2O and bake on a heat block at 60 °C for 30 min until dry.When dry, draw a circular boundary (~10 mm diameter) using a PEP pen and allow it to dry.Resuspend biotinylated BSA in T50 solution at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.Add 50 µl of biotinylated BSA on the middle of a coverslip and incubate at 37 °C for 7 min.Wash the coverslip once with 50 µl T50 solution.Add 50 µl of Neutravidin solution (final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in ddH2O) onto the coverslip for 1 min at 37 °C.Wash once with T50 solution followed by two washes with PBS.Dilute anti-CD19 antibody to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml in imaging buffer.Add 50 µl of diluted anti-CD19 onto the coverslip and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.Wash the coverslip twice with 50 µl of imaging buffer and add a further 50 µl of imaging buffer to keep the coverslip moist.",
    "Store the coated coverslips in a parafilm sealed dish at 4 °C until use.ΔCRITICAL STEP Use the coated coverslips within 3 days of coating.Cell stainingPrimary 5C.C7 T cells are activated by interaction with CH27 APCs presenting the MCC agonist peptide recognized by the 5C.C7 T cell receptor. As a control, T cells are additionally activated with the phosphatase inhibitor Pervanadate.Remove the imaging buffer that is used to keep the cover slide moist using a P200 pipette.Prime APCs, CH27 cells (from Step A9), with 10 µM MCC peptide by incubation in complete medium for at least 4 h (Ambler et al., 2017) and resuspend to 40,000 cells/50 µl of imaging buffer. Resuspend 5C.C7 TCR transgenic T cells (from Step A7) (Ambler et al., 2017) to 40,000 cells per 5 µl of imaging buffer.Seed 50 µl of APCs (40,000 cells) onto the coated cover slide and allow to settle for 10 min at room temperature.Add 5 µl of T cells (40,000 cells) or 10 µl of Pervanadate-treated T cells (40,000 cells) for 4.5min at room temperature.ΔCRITICAL STEP Gently remove the volume using a P200 pipette and add 50 µl of 4% PFA for 20 min at 4 °C.Gently wash the cover slide once with 50 µl PBS using a P200 pipette.Quench by adding 50 µl of 50 mM of NH4Cl for 10 min at 4 °C and wash the cover slide three times with 50 µl of PBS.Permeabilize the cells using 50 µl of 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C.Wash the coverslip three times with 50 µl of PBS followed by incubation with 50 µl of blocking solution (1% BSA in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Remove the solution and add 50 µl of primary antibody, anti-phospho-LAT (Tyr 191) at a dilution of 1:50 or anti-LAT at a dilution of 1:100, in 1% BSA in PBS with Fc Block (Rat Anti-Mouse CD16/CD32) at the same dilution and incubate overnight at 4 °C.Remove primary antibodies and wash the cover slide three times with 50 µl of PBS.Incubate the cover slide with 50 µl of secondary antibody (Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 488) diluted 1:1,000 in 1% BSA in PBS with Fc Block at 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature.Wash the cover slide with 50 µl of PBS for three times and remove the PBS from the coverslip.After adding one drop of ProLong Gold mount a coverslip on the slide (VWR, SuperFrost Plus) and allow to cure for 24 h.STED microscopyFirst, image the slide with the Leica SP8X STED microscope in confocal mode using the following settings:100x 1.4 NA HC PL APO CS2 STED white oil objective.512 x 512 pixels.400 Hz scan speed.488 nm excitation selected on white light laser with corresponding NF488 filter.Default 70% white laser power is to be adjusted with the acousto-optic tunable filter to as low as 10%.HyD1 hybrid detector collection range 498-520 nm.Hybrid detector gain 100%.Hybrid detector gating 0.3-8 ns.Line average 2.Output image bit size 8 bit.Whilst in confocal mode, place your sample and select a region of interest.To image your region of interest with STED, duplicate sequence 1, i.e., the sequence of imaging steps used to choose the region of interest, and modify the duplicated sequence as follows:Switch 592 nm STED laser ON. The 592 nm depletion laser generates a donut shaped depletion area for fluorophore excitation at 488 nm. Set it to 30-50%, i.e., 50-70% depletion, using the acousto-optic tunable filter depending on your Alexa Fluor 488 staining brightness.",
    "Excessive depletion may photodamage the sample.Increase 488 nm laser power as needed to maintain good signal.Select optimized frame size for STED with optimized pixel size as calculated automatically by the software using the ‘optimized pixel size’ function.Hybrid detector collection range 498-510 nm.Hybrid detector gain 200%.Hybrid detector gating 1.5-8 ns. A longer start gate time before acquisition ensures efficient depletion of the majority of molecules to improve resolution.ΔCRITICAL STEP If the data are to be deconvolved after acquisition ensure no/minimal saturation in the acquired image and adjust laser power and gain as necessary.ΔCRITICAL STEP Once the STED sequence has been set, go to Configuration to align STED beams.STED beams need to be aligned every 15 min for the first hour to minimize temperature drift.Start scan and acquire STED images."
