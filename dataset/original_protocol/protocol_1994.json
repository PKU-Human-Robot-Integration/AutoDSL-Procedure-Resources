    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAssay of TMEM41B scramblase activity in vitro\nHere we describe the reconstitution of TMEM41B into liposomes to characterize its scramblase activity using a fluorescence liposome-based in vitro scramblase assay (Brunner et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Ghanbarpour et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Hrafnsdóttir and Menon, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Marek and Günther-Pomorski, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Mathiassen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Matoba et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Menon et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Ploier and Menon, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Vehring et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). Trace amounts of 7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl acyl chain-labeled phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC) adapts a ∼50% distribution between the inner and the outer leaflet of a symmetric liposome bilayer. The addition of membrane-impermeant dithionite quenches outer leaflet NBD fluorescence of the liposomes, resulting in ∼50% fluorescence bleaching of NBD. In the presence of a scramblase (TMEM41B), which catalyzes the exchange of NBD-lipids between the leaflets, greater fluorescent quenching will be observed due to exposure of inner leaflet NBD to dithionite on the outer leaflet. Similar studies have been carried out previously on related scramblases such as Triton-extracted ER scramblases, opsin, TMEM16, ATG9 and VMP1 (Brunner et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Ghanbarpour et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Hrafnsdóttir and Menon, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Mathiassen et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Matoba et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Menon et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Suzuki et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Vehring et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nExpression and purification of recombinant TMEM41B\nTiming: 7 days\nCell-related operations need to be performed in a Class II biological safety cabinet. Wipe the table with 70% ethanol and the ultraviolet irradiate for 30 min.",
    "FreeStyle™ 293F cells are expanded in 250 mL glass flasks in SMM 293-T1 medium (Sino Biological Inc.) supplemented with 0.5% Pen/strep and 1% FBS. The cells are incubated in a 37°C oscillation incubator with 5% CO2, with optimal shaker speed at approximately 100–130 rpm. The cells are seeded at 0.5 × 106 viable cells/mL when cell density reaches 2.0 × 106 viable cells/mL (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nProtein expression and purification (a culture of 50 mL).\nTransfect 1 μg plasmids (the weight ratio of DNA:PEI is 3:1) per mL cells when cell density reaches 1.5–2.0 × 106 viable cells/mL. Prepare DNA-PEI complexes, as follows:\nDilute 50 μg plasmid DNA into 1.5 mL SMM 293-T1 medium, mix gently and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nDilute 150 μg PEI into 1.5 mL SMM 293-T1 medium, mix gently and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nMix the plasmid DNA with the PEI. Incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 10–20 min.\nAdd the mixture from step 2a-iii to 50 mL of 1.5–2.0 × 106 cells/mL in a 250 mL glass shaker flask and place it back into the 37°C oscillation incubator with 5% CO2.\nCollect the cells in 50 mL centrifuge tubes 48 h after transfection, and centrifuge at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4°C using an Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge with a 50 mL tube holder.\nResuspend the cells in 10 mL cold (4°C) TBS buffer. Centrifuge at 1,000 g for another 10 min at 4°C. Snap freeze the cell pellet in liquid nitrogen, and store at −80°C until further use.\nThaw the cell pellet at 4°C, resuspend in 5 mL buffer A, and lyse with a Dounce homogenizer (10 passes). Transfer the lysate to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Note: DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail should be added to prepare buffer A just before use. Avoid the formation of bubbles when using the Dounce homogenizer to minimize protein degradation.\nAdd 0.5 mL DDM (10% (w/v) stock concentration) to the cell lysate (1% (w/v) final concentration), and gently rotate (10 rpm) the lysate using a MX-RD-Pro LCD digital Rotator at 4°C for 90 min.\nTransfer the lysate to an Open-Top Thinwall Polypropylene Tube. Centrifuge the cell lysate at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4°C (using a TLA 100.3 rotor) to remove cell debris and undissolved membranes.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 15 mL centrifuge tube. Incubate the supernatant with 50 μL ANTI-FLAG M2 beads (MilliporeSigma, Cat# A2220) and rotate (10 rpm) the mixture at 4°C for 4 h.\nNote: The ANTI-FLAG M2 beads should be pre-equilibrated with 1 mL buffer B in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, by centrifuging the ANTI-FLAG M2 beads at 4,000 g for 1 min at 4°C to remove the supernatant in Centrifuge 5424 R, repeat the wash step for 3 times.\nAfter incubation, pellet the ANTI-FLAG M2 beads by centrifuge at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4°C using an Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge with a 15 mL tube holder. Transfer the ANTI-FLAG M2 beads to a new 1.5 mL tube, wash the beads with 1 mL buffer B about 4 times.\nTo remove chaperones, incubate the washed ANTI-FLAG M2 beads with 1 mL buffer B supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM ATP and 1× EDTA-free Roche complete protease inhibitor cocktail, rotate (10 rpm) at 4°C overnight (12–14 h).\nWash the ANTI-FLAG M2 beads about 6 times with buffer B until the OD280 of the supernatant is close to 0 detecting by a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer.",
    "Elute the recombinational FLAG-TMEM41B protein from the ANTI-FLAG M2 beads using 0.1 mg/mL FLAG peptide in buffer B supplemented with 1× EDTA-free Roche complete protease inhibitor cocktail, the elution volume is 500 μL. Rotate (10 rpm) at 4°C for 2 h.\nConcentrate the recombinant human FLAG-TMEM41B protein in Amicon 0.5 mL concentrators (10 kDa cutoffs) by centrifuging the concentrators at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4°C in centrifuge 5424 R. When the liquid is reduced to a fifth of its volume, add 450 μL buffer B.\nRepeat step 11 for 3 times to change the buffer of the recombinant human FLAG-TMEM41B protein with buffer B. Concentrate the volume to 50–100 μL.\nConcentrated human FLAG-TMEM41B protein can be analyzed following SDS-PAGE. BSA protein from Pierce™ BCA Protein Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher) are diluted in a series of concentrations (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 and 1/64 mg/mL) as the standards. As shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1592-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant human FLAG-TMEM41B\nThe black arrow: recombinant human FLAG-TMEM41B protein; the red arrow: serial diluted BSA standards.\nNote: We recommend to load the same volume of purified human FLAG-TMEM41B and BSA protein, which could make it easier to determine the protein concentration of recombinant human FLAG-TMEM41B by Coomassie blue staining.\nLiposome preparation\nTiming: 2 days\nDissolve POPC (final concentration 25 mg/mL), POPG (final concentration 25 mg/mL) and 18:1–12:0 NBD-PC (final concentration 1 mg/mL) in chloroform (HPLC grade) on ice. Lipids powder could be dissolved in chloroform within one minute.\nNote: The lipids stock solutions can be stored at −20°C for several months in glass jars. Powdered lipids can be stored at −20°C for 1 year, according to the reagent specification of Avanti Polar Lipids.",
    "Add 143.5 μL POPC, 16 μL POPG and 9.5 μL 18:1–12:0 NBD-PC (about 0.2 mol% of the total phospholipids) to a 100 mL single neck round bottom ball bottle. The total lipids used here is about 3.98 mg, and the molar ratio of POPC versus POPG is 9:1 (mol/mol).\nDry the lipids by rotary evaporation (Ruideyiqi, Cat# N-1100-D) under an argon or nitrogen stream at a rotation speed of 120 rpm, for 5–15 min until the chloroform has evaporated. Then transfer the flask to a vacuum desiccator at RT (20°C–25°C) for at least 3 h or overnight (12–14 h), the pressure of vacuum desiccator is about -12 – -15 psi.\nNote: as the lipids dry, the inside of the glass bottle will be covered with a green-colored lipid film.\nCritical: Dry the lipids at a slow speed to make sure the lipids form a thin lipid film. If it dries too quickly, a green film with uneven thickness can be observed on the inside of the glass bottle.\nResuspend the lipid film in 0.5 mL buffer C to generate a 10.5 mM lipid solution, by gently swirling the flask and incubate at 37°C for 10 min, until forming a homogenous turbid solution. The lipids would form multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). Transfer the solution to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPause point: The MLVs solution can be stored at −80°C for 1–3 months. We avoid using MLVs stored longer than 3 months due to concerns of lipids oxidation.\nFreeze-thaw the MLVs for 10 cycles by alternately placing it in liquid nitrogen and at a 37°C water bath, 3–5 min is needed for each operation.",
    "Assemble the mini-extruder (Avanti, Cat# 610020), as instructed by Avanti (https://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment-products/mini-extruder-assembly-instructions[href=https://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment-products/mini-extruder-assembly-instructions]). Extrude the lipids suspension 20 times through a membrane with a 400 nm pore size, followed by 10 times extrusion through a membrane with 200 nm pore size at RT (20°C–25°C). Transfer the samples to a new 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nStore the liposomes at 4°C and use within the day of preparation.\nCritical: The liposomes preparation should be stored above 0°C. Because the gel-liquid crystal transition temperature of POPC is −2°C, low temperature might damage the liposomes. The samples should be kept out of the light to avoid photobleaching of NBD.\nProteoliposome preparation\nTiming: 3 days\nDilute the liposomes in buffer C to a final lipids concentration of 5.25 mM (∼3.98 mg/mL).\nAdd Triton X-100 to the liposomes to a final concentration of 7 mM. Rotate (10 rpm) at RT (20°C–25°C) for 2–3 h to destabilize the liposomes.\nNote: After incubating with 7 mM Triton X-100, the solution would become clear because the destabilizing of liposomes particles.\nAfter 2–3 h of Triton X-100 destabilization, add 0.2% (w/v) DDM-solubilized recombinant human FLAG-TMEM41B protein preps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], ∼0.1 mg/mL) to the samples and gently rotate (10 rpm) at RT (20°C–25°C) for 1 h. The volume of destabilized liposomes per sample is 250 μL in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: Here the recombinant human FLAG-TMEM41B protein concentrations 200 nM, 80 nM and 16 nM have been used to assay its scramblase activity, at a protein-to-lipid molar ratio ∼1:26000, 1:65000 and 1:320000, respectively. Add additional buffer B to ensure consistent phospholipids concentration across groups, as well as protein-free liposomes.\nMeanwhile, prepare the bio-beads. Wash the bio-beads 2 times with methanol, 3 times with ddH2O and 1 time with buffer C. For each washing step stir slowly for 10 min.",
    "Note: It is recommended to prepare the 100 mg bio-beads for each sample, you can prepare the bio-beads for several samples at once, the specific weight of bio-beads depends on the sample you prepared.\nAdd 20 mg of the prepared bio-beads to each sample and rotate (10 rpm) the mixture at RT (20°C–25°C) for 1 h.\nAdd additional 20 mg of bio-beads and rotate (10 rpm) at RT (20°C–25°C) for another 2 h.\nTransfer the liquid by gel loading tips (Cat# LC1001) to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 40 mg of fresh bio-beads and rotate (10 rpm) at 4°C overnight (12–14 h).\nNote: It is recommended to use gel loading tips (Cat# LC1001) to transfer the liquid because of the slenderness and easy access of the tips, which could avoid pipetting the particles of bio-beads.\nTransfer the sample to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with a hole in the lid. Cover the hole with a pre-washed (with buffer C) dialysis membrane (30 kDa). Close the lid and make sure there is no leakage. Put the lid under the liquid in 500 mL buffer C in a 1 L beaker, magnetic rotor stirring (150 rpm) and dialyze against buffer C at 4°C for 2 days to remove the remaining detergent.\nNote: Make sure the dialysis membrane and 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube cover lid are tightly closed to prevent fluid from flowing out of the side. After incubation with bio-beads and dialysis, the solution would be turbid when the samples are observed against light. The samples should be kept from light to avoid photobleaching of NBD.\nScramblase assay\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Dilute the liposomes/proteoliposomes (∼5 mM lipids concentration) to ∼200 μM final lipids concentration with buffer C. The scramblase assay is performed at 30°C in 96-well plates, and the reaction volume per sample is 100 μL.\nTo assess scrambling activity of recombinant human FLAG-TMEM41B protein, the NBD fluorescence (excitation at 460 nm, emission at 538 nm) per sample is monitored using Gen5™ software in the Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek), with an inspection interval of 10 s.\nAfter ∼200 s recording, the addition of dithionite (to final concentration 10 mM) is added to monitor the reduce of the NBD fluorescence (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3], troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: 1 M dithionite is dissolved in 0.5 M unbuffered Tris (e.g., 10 mg of dithionite dissolve in 57 μL ice-cold 0.5 M Tris immediately before use) and keep on ice. The dissolved dithionite should be used within 10 min after preparation.\nAfter ∼600 s recording, add 2.5 μL 20% (w/v) Triton X-100 to each sample. The Triton X-100 will destabilize the liposomes/proteoliposomes, resulting in complete bleaching of the NBD fluorescence (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3], troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nData analysis: Calculate the relative fluorescent of NBD according to the following formula:\n  FI  ( t )  /FI  ( 0 )    =    [  F t    - F  Triton  ]  /  [  F 0    - F  Triton  ]   \nF0 represent the initial fluorescent intensity before dithionite, Ft represent the fluorescent intensity at “t” sec and FTriton is the final background fluorescence after adding Triton X-100. The curves of scramblase assay data are generated using GraphPad Prism8.\nAssay of TMEM41B scramblase activity in vivo",
    "Phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant phospholipid, is synthesized at the cytosolic leaflet of the ER (Vance, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), and subsequently translocated to the luminal leaflet by scramblases in wild-type (WT) cells (Pomorski and Menon, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Alkyne-choline could be incorporated into PC in the living cells (Jao et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Sun et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), and visualized by azide-alkyne following so-called click reaction. In mutant cells devoid of scramblases at the ER, the newly synthesized alkyne-PC is expected to accumulate on the cytosolic leaflets. The PC on the cytosolic leaflet of the ER can be selectively visualized with digitonin permeabilization, which leaves the organelle biolayer intact. Here we describe the click-chemistry and imaging approach to visualize the cytosolic leaflet of the TMEM41B WT/KO cells to examine the TMEM41B scramblase activity in vivo.\nIn vivo metabolic labeling to visualize PC\nTiming: 4 days\nCell-related operations need to be performed in a Class II biological safety cabinet. Wipe the table with 70% ethanol and ultraviolet irradiate for 30 min.\nWT and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TMEM41B knockout Huh7 cells are seeded on Fisherbrand™ Borosilicate Glass Square Coverslip (Cat# 3406) in 6-well Cell Culture plates at ∼25% confluence (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nAfter 12 h, transfect 1 μg GFP-SEC61β plasmids to each well, which labels the ER membrane.\nAdd 1 μg GFP-SEC61β plasmids to 200 μL serum-free DMEM, mix gently and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nAdd 4 μg PEI to the mixture, mix gently and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 15 min.\nAfter incubation, add the medium from step 35b to the cells.\n8 h after transfection, exchange the media with DMEM supplemented with 1% Pen/strep, 10% FBS and 100 μM alkyne-choline. Culture the cells for another 12–24 h (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).",
    "Note: Alkyne-choline should be thaw at RT (20°C–25°C) and added to the medium before use. Vortex vigorously before added to the cells.\nWash the cells with 1× PBS 3 times. Fix cells with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde at RT (20°C–25°C) for 15 min. Wash the cells with 1× PBS 3 times.\nPermeabilize the cells with 25 μg/mL digitonin in 1× PBS for 10 min and wash the cells with PBS 3 times.\nThe cells on coverslips are incubated with 10 μM 5-TAMRA azide, BTTAA-CuSO4 complex (50 μM CuSO4, BTTAA/CuSO4 (6:1, mol/mol)) and 2.5 mM sodium ascorbate in 1× PBS at RT (20°C–25°C) for 1 h.\nPrepare 200 μL click reaction mixture, as given below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1592_21.csv\nNote: Sodium ascorbate should be prepared just before use. It is important to make sure the liquid phase cover the coverslips throughout the experiment.\nWash the cells with 1× PBS 3 times, 10 min per time, and block the cells in 1× PBS with 1% BSA at RT (20°C–25°C) for 15 min.\nThe coverslips are mounted to a glass slide (NorthGlass, Cas# B2237), wait until the mounting medium dries. It’s optional to seal the slides with colorless nail polish. Then subject to confocal microscopy (troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11]).\nImaging is performed on a Zeiss LSM 880 with an Airyscan confocal microscope. GFP and TAMRA channels visualize ER (SEC61β) and PC (alkyne-choline), respectively. The parameters used here are as follows: excitation/emission wavelength = 493/517 nm, 577/603 nm, exposure time = 500 ms, gain = 700, pinhole = 1 AU, at RT (20°C–25°C). The images are saved as LSM files, and the image resolution is 1024 × 1024.\nCo-localization analysis and fluorescence intensity are quantified using ImageJ Fiji, as described in the following:\nOpen the LSM files by ImageJ Fiji.",
    "Crop images to select the region on the periphery ER using the selection tools.\nFrom the Analyze menu select “Set Measurements”. Make sure area integrated intensity and mean gray value are selected.\nSelect “Measure” from the Analyze menu. Then there will be a pop-up box with a stack of values.\nSelect a region next to your cell that has no fluorescence, take this as the background signal. The value of the target area will be subtracted from the value of the background area as its signal value. The following are the operation for colocalization analysis:\nOpen the LSM files by ImageJ Fiji.\nCrop images to select a region of interest using the selection tool.\nFrom the Image menu select “Color-Split Channels” to divide pictures into different channels.\nSelect “Colocalization-Coloc 2” from the analyze menu for the colocalization analysis.\nAnalyzed by GraphPad Prism8 to compare the data difference from TMEM41B WT and KO Huh7 cells, and the two-tailed Student’s t-test is used.\nCritical: Because the perinuclear regions contain stacks of ER membrane, it is difficult to avoid out-of-focus signals or over saturation of fluorescence. For more accurate quantification, it is recommended to quantify the fluorescent intensity of periphery ER (GFP-SEC61β) of the TAMRA channel for both TMEM41B WT and KO cells."
