    "1. Preparation for Purification\nPreparation of the cell-free crude extract\n\t\nObtain a ~9-10 g cell pellet of E. coli (BL21) that overexpressed the polyhistidine tagged metalloprotein25 in a 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd 5 mL per gram of room temp lysis/bind buffer (50 mM Phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole at pH 8) to the ~9-10 g of cell pellet for a total volume ~45-50 mL. Periodically vortex to encourage dissolution. If the pellet was frozen, thaw in a tepid water bath.\nUsing ice-water bath, chill the cell suspension to ~3 °C in preparation for cell lysis.\n\t\tNote: At this point, cell lysis by sonication, bead milling or another method is possible. Bead milling is demonstrated here because it is rapid, relatively inexpensive, and does not require ear protection.\nAssemble a 50 mL bead milling chamber according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nFill the bead mill chamber half full of chilled 0.1 mm glass beads that have been stored at -20 °C.\nFill the rest of the chamber with the chilled cell suspension and use 4 °C lysis/bind buffer to fill the chamber completely.\nUse a small spatula to rotate the shaft of the bead mill and mix the cell suspension with the beads.\nRemove any large bubbles with a pipet, and then screw the lid on.\nDry off the chamber from any leakage.\nAdd about 1 cup of ice to the clear, plastic jacket, invert the filled 50 mL chamber into the ice filled jacket, and screw closed.\nSecure the ice-jacketed chamber onto the motor.\nTurn the bead mill motor on for 15 seconds at 15,800 rpm, then allow to rest for 45 seconds. Repeat 8 times.",
    "When the 8 cycles are complete, decant the entire cell lysis suspension into a 50 mL or larger tube rated for high speed centrifugation (25,000 x g or higher). Place a pair of balanced tubes in centrifuge and spin at 25,000 x g for 40-45 minutes at 4°C to pellet cell debris and glass beads.\n\t\tNote: If 50 mL or larger tubes rated for high speed centrifugation are not available, remove the glass beads by centrifuging at 1000 - 2000 x g for 2-3 min in a 50 mL conical tube to yield a smaller volume of cell suspension (~25 mL) that can be decanted into a smaller volume tube rated for high speed centrifugation.\nWhen centrifugation is complete, decant the clear, yellow, cell-free, crude extracts into a clean 50 mL conical tube. Take care not to transfer any cell debris.\nCollect a small sample of the cell-free crude extracts for later analysis of the purification by SDS-PAGE26.\nPreparation of the IMAC column\n\t\nObtain a 1.5 x 20 cm column equipped with a lower bed support to retain resin particles, a Luer lock outlet and an upper cap that also contains a Luer lock fitting. Fit the Luer-lock outlet with a stopcock to control flow.\nWorking at the benchtop, securely mount the column on a ring stand.\nObtain a 50% slurry of nickel-bound nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin in 20% ethanol that has been stored at 4 °C.\nGently swirl the bottle to evenly re-suspend the resin.\nWorking at room-temperature and on the benchtop, use a graduated pipet to withdraw 2 mL of the slurry, which will yield 1 mL of settled resin capable of binding 50-60 mg of polyhistidine tagged protein, and transfer the slurry to the column.",
    "Open the stopcock and allow the excess storage solution to drain by gravity from the resin.\nClose the stopcock securely\nUsing a Pasteur pipet, carefully add chilled lysis/bind buffer (50 mM Phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole at pH 8) and to the column of resin – at least 30 mL. Take care not to disturb the resin surface. Run the buffer down the walls of the column to prevent splashing.\nEquilibrate the resin by allowing the lysis/bind buffer to drain slowly from the column by gravity into a collection beaker.\nWhen the lysis/bind buffer has mostly drained, close the stopcock to stop the flow of buffer when ~5 mL of lysis buffer remains above the resin and leave the column, mounted upright, until ready to proceed or for up to 1 week.\n2. Purification of Polyhistidine-tagged Target by IMAC\nPrepare wash buffer (50 mM Phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole pH 8) and elution buffer (50 mM Phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol pH 8). Chill at 4°C.\nPrepare the Ni-NTA column for the addition of the cell-free crude extracts by opening the stopcock and allowing remaining lysis/binding buffer to drain by gravity through the Ni-NTA resin. When all the buffer has drained, and the resin surface is exposed, close the stopcock.\nUsing a Pasteur pipet, carefully pipet the cell free crude extracts onto the resin, taking care not to disturb the surface. Run the crude extracts down the walls of the column to prevent splashing. The volume of crude extracts applied is dependent on the level of expression of the polyhistidine-tagged protein; ensure the total volume of crude extracts contains 50-60 mg or less of the target protein per mL of Ni-NTA resin (see step 1.2.4).",
    "When all of the crude extracts have been transferred to the column, open the stopcock so the column can drain by gravity. This flow through is composed of proteins that did not bind to the resin – collect 100 μL for later analysis of the purification by SDS-PAGE.26\nThe viscosity of the cell-free crude extracts can slow the gravity flow of the column considerably. To increase the rate of flow, apply a simple “hand-pump”:\n\t\nTake a 10 mL Luer-lock syringe and connect it to the cap of the column using a short length of plastic tubing and Luer-lock fittings between to the column cap and the syringe. Draw out the syringe plunger, and then tightly fit the column cap on the top of the column.\nGently compress the plunger of the syringe while manually assessing the flow rate by collecting the eluent into a graduated cylinder; rates of 1-2 mL per minute are compatible with the resin and this setup. Gently increase compression of the syringe plunger as the flow rate slows.\nTo prevent the introduction of air into the resin, remove the column cap and attached hand-pump when the meniscus of the applied liquid reaches 5-10 mm above the resin bed, and allow the remaining volume to drain by gravity.\nWhen the cell free crude extracts have finished draining and the resin surface is exposed again, use a Pasteur pipet to carefully add ~30 mL of chilled Wash buffer to the column – taking care not to disturb the surface of the resin. Run the buffer down the walls of the column to prevent splashing.\nOpen the stopcock and allow the wash buffer to drain through the column. This process is removing weakly bound proteins from the resin. Discard the eluent.",
    "While the wash buffer is draining, prepare sixteen, labeled, microcentrifuge tubes for collecting 1 mL fractions.\nWhen the wash buffer has drained, and the resin surface is exposed again, close the stopcock. Use a Pasteur pipet to carefully add ~30 mL of chilled elution buffer to the column – taking care not to disturb the surface of the resin. Run the buffer down the walls of the column to prevent splashing.\nOpen the stopcock slowly and allow the elution buffer to elute the polyhistidine tagged protein from the column. Collect 1 mL of eluent in each of the marked microcentrifuge tubes, 1 through 16.\nTest the fractions for protein using a colorimetric protein assay such as the Bradford assay or UV-Visible spectroscopy according to the methods specific by the reagent and/or instrument manufacturers27,28. As shown here, the colorimetric assay using Coomassie blue is scaled down to a 100 μL volume in order to sacrifice only a small volume from each fraction.\nMix 3 μL of each fraction with 100 µL of a colorimetric protein assay reagent and manually observe the formation of any color to indicate the presence of protein in the fraction; detection with a spectrometer is not necessary.\nIf protein is found in fraction 16, continue eluting 1 mL fractions and assay for protein periodically, until the eluted fractions no longer contain a significant amount of protein.\nCombine protein-containing fractions into a clean conical tube, and withdraw a 100 μL sample for later analysis by SDS-PAGE26.\nProceed with reconstitution of the metal ion cofactor or freeze the protein in 3 mL aliquots at -80°C. Ensure that 10% glycerol is included in the elution buffer is a cryoprotectant to stabilize the pure protein during freezing.",
    "When elution of the Ni-NTA column is complete, that is, all the protein is off the column and collected in fractions, pass another 25 mL of elution buffer through the column, and store the column at 4 °C in ~5 mL of elution buffer for short-term storage, or lysis/bind buffer with 20% ethanol for longer-term storage.\n3. Reconstitution of Target Protein with Fe2+\nAddition of Fe2+\n\tNote: A non-heme iron (II) binding enzyme, such as the L-DOPA dioxygenase in this example, requires an Fe2+ ion for activity; however, the iron (II) readily oxidizes to iron (III), which is inactive, and a fraction of the protein purifies without any iron at all.\n\t\nTo begin the reconstitution of the metal, obtain 3 mL of the purified enzyme suspended in elution buffer. If frozen, thaw rapidly using a tepid water bath, and once thawed, put the protein on ice.\nUsing the volume of protein in the tube, calculate the amount of sodium ascorbate (198.1 g/mol) necessary to make the final concentration 12.5 mM in the sample. Also, calculate the amount of dithiothreitol (DTT, 154.25 g/mol) necessary to make the final concentration 12.5 mM in the sample.\nAdd the solid sodium ascorbate and DTT and gently, but thoroughly, mix to dissolve completely. Take care not to cause protein precipitation with overly aggressive mixing. Add a small amount of iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (MW 278.01 g/mol) to the protein sample.\nIn order to obtain a small enough quantity of the iron salt, tap a few 1 mm granules of FeSO4•7H2O solid out on a piece of weigh paper, fold the paper over the granule, and crush it with the flat side of a metal spatula.\nAdd a grain of the resulting powder to the tube of protein.",
    "Vortex to mix and a rosy pink color will appear in the tube.\nIncubate the pink solution of protein, capped, for 10-30 minutes on ice. The pink color will slowly fade over time.\nGel filtration\n\t\nUse a gel filtration column packed with 10 mL of spherical polyacrylamide gel with a molecular weight exclusion limit of approximately 6,000 and a hydrated particle size range of 90–180 µm in a 1.5 x 12 cm column, which is also equipped with a 10 mL reservoir. Ensure the column is equipped with lower and upper bed supports in the form of 30 um porous polyethylene disks to retain the resin in the column and prevent the resin bed from running dry. Mount the gel filtration column to a ring stand.\nIf using a pre-packaged gel filtration column, remove the cap and pour off the excess buffer above the upper bed support.\nTo equilibrate the column, begin by filling the reservoir with buffer compatible with subsequent assay and storage, for example, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol at pH 8.0.\nIf using a pre-packaged gel filtration column, snap off the bottom tip of gel filtration column to start the flow of buffer and expose the Luer slip fitting. Fit a stopcock to the Luer slip end of the column, but leave it open and allow the column to drip by gravity.\nWhen the buffer has drained from the column and the upper bed support is exposed, close the stopcock, and add the ~3 mL of the Fe (II) reconstituted metalloenzyme to the column by pipetting the solution onto the exposed upper bed support.",
    "Open the stopcock and allow the entire 3.0 mL sample to enter the column by gravity. Discard these first 3 mL of eluent. Any pink color that forms while handling the solution will be trapped at the top of the column.\nWhen the column has stopped dripping and the upper bed support is exposed, add 4 mL of the gel-filtration buffer (e.g., 50 mM NaH2PO4, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol at pH 8.0) to the column. Open the stopcock and collect the eluent into microcentrifuge tubes over eight 0.5 mL fractions.\nTest the fractions for protein using a colorimetric protein assay or UV-Vis27,28 as described earlier.\nCombine protein-containing fractions.\nWithdraw a sample for SDS-PAGE analysis26.\nProceed with assay or storage of the sample."
