    "This protocol describes the procedure to isolate intact nuclei from FFPE tissue sections. It involves removal of the paraffin from the FFPE section with xylene, hydration of the tissue section with a series of different concentrations of ethanol (EtOH), mechanical tissue microdissection, enzymatic digestion with a collagenase and hyaluronidase mix, disaggregation of tissue to obtain single-nuclei suspension, and filtration to remove extracellular matrices. The isolated nuclei can then be stored at 4°C before continuing with Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-prot-0002].\nMaterials\nFFPE tissue sections (10–20 µm thick, see Strategic Planning)\nXylene (HistoLab, cat. no. 02070)\nEthanol (VWR, cat. no.

For deparaffinization and rehydration, place the FFPE section (10–20 μm thick) in a 50-ml Falcon tube filled with 2 ml xylene. Repeat 3 times, each for 5 min.\nTo get more intact nuclei, a 20-μm section is recommended.\n2. Transfer the FFPE section to a 50-ml Falcon tube with 2 ml of 100% EtOH for 5 min, and repeat once.\n3. Transfer the tissue section sequentially into another 50-ml Falcon tube containing 96%, 70%, 50%, and 30% EtOH, one per chamber, each for 5 min. Finally, incubate the tissue in sterile water for 5 min.\n4. After rehydration, transfer the tissue to a 50-ml Falcon tube with 2 ml PBS containing 0.5 mM CaCl2. Then, transfer the section to a sterilized glass Petri plate for tissue microdissection. Dissect the section into small pieces with two 21G needles under a stereomicroscope.\nTo get a good yield of nuclei, break the tissue into very small pieces with a sharp needle and keep the tissue from drying out during tissue microdissection by adding drops of PBS containing 0.5 mM CaCl2.\n5. Collect the fragmented tissue in a 1.5-ml tube and centrifuge at 3000 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\n6. Discard supernatant. Resuspend the pellet with 1 ml of collagenase and hyaluronidase cocktail (see REAGENTS AND SOLUTIONS) and incubate for 16 hr at 37°C.\n7. After incubation, dilute the enzymatic mix by adding 400 μl NST buffer. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 × g for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "8. Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 800 μl of NST buffer, containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% DNase-free RNase A, and pass through a 27G needle syringe into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube at least 30 times for disaggregation. Centrifuge the mixture at 3000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.\n9. Resuspend the nuclei pellet with 800 μl of NST buffer and filter twice using a 30-µm filter into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge at 3000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, resuspend the nuclei pellet in 500 μl PBS containing 0.05 μg of sodium azide.\n10. Count isolated nuclei using a cell counter (use 10 µl) and also take 10 µl to stain the nuclei. To stain, mix the 10 µl aliquot with 490 µl PBS containing 0.5 µl Hoechst (Stock concentration: 10 mg/ml) and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Then, use Cellspin I to centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min, to transfer the nuclei onto the glass slide. Air dry and place a drop of SlowFade™ Gold Antifade Mountant. Seal the edges of the glass slide with nail polish. Finally, visualize the DAPI signal under the microscope (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-fig-0002]). Purified nuclei can be used directly for Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-prot-0002] or stored at 4°C for 1–2 weeks.\nFor Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-prot-0002], use freshly prepared nuclei after no more than 1–2 weeks at 4°C.\nNormally, 500,000–1,000,000 nuclei should be obtained from one mouse liver or kidney FFPE tissue section (20-μm thick, with an area of 1 cm × 1 cm).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fbb6bc40-1eda-485b-a880-b8a500326c56/cpz1535-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nNuclei isolated from mouse FFPE samples.

    "This protocol describes the steps from T7-Tn5 transposase tagmentation until purification of in vitro transcribed RNA. T7-Tn5 transposase is used to insert the T7 promoter sequence into the accessible regions of the chromatin from the nuclei purified in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-prot-0001]. After tagmentation, nuclei are digested with proteinase K, followed by reverse crosslinking, and the RNA is then in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA Polymerase to produce high quality RNA molecules for library preparation for high-throughput sequencing.

    "3. After checking T7-Tn5 transposase activity, transfer the required number of isolated FFPE nuclei from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-prot-0001] (50,000 nuclei) to a new 1.5-ml tube and spin down the nuclei at 2800 × g for 5 min at RT. Discard the supernatant.\nFor a low number of nuclei (less than 5000), use 0.5-ml tubes to visualize the pellet during centrifugation.\n4. Resuspend the nuclei pellet with 50 µl lysis buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-rec-0006]) and immediately centrifuge at 2800 × g for 10 min at RT. Discard the supernatant.\n5. Add 50 µl of transposase master mixture (25 µl of 2× TD buffer, 22.5 µl nuclease-free water, and 2.5 µl of 2 µM T7-Tn5) to the pellet and resuspend. Incubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nReverse-crosslinking\n6. After incubation, directly add 50 µl of 2× reverse cross-linking buffer and 1 µl Proteinase K to the tagmentation reaction mixture. Incubate overnight at 65°C with 1200 rpm shaking in a ThermoMixer.\nFor complete protein digestion, we recommend doing a second proteinase K digestion for 2 hr at 45°C and at 1200 rpm shaking, by adding 1 µl Proteinase K/tube.\n7. Purify the DNA using a MinElute PCR purification kit following the manufacturer's instructions, and elute in 20 µl elution buffer.\nFormaldehyde reverse cross-linking involves dissociation of the methylene linkage between the protein and DNA moieties and can be achieved with proteinase K digestion, high salt concentration, or heat (Kennedy-Darling & Smith, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-bib-0017]).\nGap filling",

Then, incubate the reaction mixture for 5 min at 72°C in a thermal cycler. Purify the sample using the Qiagen MinElute PCR Purification kit following the manufacturer's instructions, and elute in 50 µl elution buffer.\n9. To purify the samples and remove fragments shorter than 150 bp, add 50 µl of SPRI beads, followed by incubation at 15 min at RT.\n10. After incubation, transfer the tubes to a magnetic rack for 10 min. Wash the beads twice with 150 μl of 80% v/v ethanol, and air dry for 10 min at RT by leaving tubes on the magnetic rack.\n11. Once air dry, remove the tubes from the magnetic rack, resuspend the beads in 25 µl nuclease-free water, and incubate for 10 min at RT.\n12. Place the tube on the magnetic rack for 10 min and carefully transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5-ml tube. Place the tube on ice.\nIn vitro transcription\n13. Perform in vitro transcription (IVT) with a T7 RNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs) by mixing the following reagents: 10 µl template DNA (from Step 12), 1 µl of each ATP/CTP/UTP/GTP, 1 µl T7 mix, and 3 µl nuclease-free water.\n14. Incubate the IVT mixture (20 µl) at 37°C overnight (12–16 hr).

Measure the RNA concentration using NanoDrop and proceed to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-prot-0003] or immediately store at −80°C.\nThe RNA yield is time-dependent; more than 1 μg/μl IVT RNA should be generated after 12 hr.",
    "The goal of the protocol is to prepare Illumina sequencing libraries using the IVT RNA molecules from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-prot-0002].\nRandom hexamer primers are used to produce single-stranded cDNAs from the purified IVT transcripts generated in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-prot-0002], followed by dsDNA synthesis. A second tagmentation is performed with standard Tn5 transposase, which inserts its two DNA adaptors into the dsDNA. Each DNA sequencing library is amplified using a unique forward (i5) and reverse primer (i7) (Buenrostro et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-bib-0003]) combination. Then, users will run a PAGE gel, isolate and purify the DNA (220–1000 bp) from the gel, and run it through a high-sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer chip, to check DNA size distribution and quantify the DNA concentration of the DNA library.\nMaterials\nIVT-transcribed RNA from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-prot-0002]\nRandom Hexamer Primer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Then, centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 5 min and discard the 0.5-ml punched tube, leaving the small gel pieces collected in the 2-ml Eppendorf tube.\nThe aim of this step is to reduce the entire gel slice into small pieces.\nInto each 2-ml tube containing the gel pieces, add 300 μl of crush soak buffer and incubate the mixture at 55°C for 8 hr with 1400 rpm shaking, to dissolve DNA fragments in the buffer.\nThe aim of this step is to dissolve DNA fragments in the buffer.\nAfter incubation, transfer the gel mixture to Costar spin-X centrifuge tubes and centrifuge for 5 min at 16,000 × g.\nCollect the solution passing through the filter and use Zymo ChIP DNA Clean and concentrator kit to purify it. Then, elute in 15 μl of elution buffer.\nWe follow the manufacturer's standard protocol to perform DNA purification. Please refer to the standard protocol from this kit for a detailed procedure.\nQuantification of the DNA library\n15. Quantify the DNA concentration and check the DNA size distribution of the FFPE-ATAC library with a high-sensitivity DNA Bioanalyzer kit, following the manufacturer's instructions.\nA typical FFPE-ATAC library DNA size distribution is shown in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-fig-0004]. DNA sequencing libraries should be 220–1000 bp.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5d44d3af-0dea-4be8-849a-bb867d28d0d4/cpz1535-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nBioanalyzer results show the size distribution of the FFPE-ATAC DNA library. The size distribution should be from 200 to 500 bp.\nSequencing and data analysis\n16. Sequence FFPE-ATAC libraries on an Illumina sequencer to obtain at least 40 million paired-end sequencing reads (150 bp) per sequencing library.",
    "17. Analyze FFPE-ATAC sequencing libraries following the workflow as illustrated in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.535#cpz1535-fig-0005]. Briefly, remove adaptor sequences, align sequences to reference genome, remove sequence duplicates, and perform peak calling.
