    "Part I. Cross-presentation analysis of bead-bound OVA in BMDC in vitro Preparation of beads (Day: -1, sterile environment)The day before the cross-presentation experiment, particles are coupled to OVA (bead-bound OVA: bbOVA). Polystyrene beads of 3 μm diameter are coated with soluble OVA and soluble BSA ranging from 100% OVA (most concentrated) to 100% BSA (background). Since BSA is not cross-presented, the preparation of beads coated with 100% BSA is the accurate control to check whether beads without any antigen coating are able to induce any additional activation of DC.Estimate the amount of 3 μm beads that will be used during the cross-presentation experiment on day 0. Consider to prepare a minimum of at least four different conditions:100% OVA and 0% BSA: 10 mg/ml OVA50% OVA and 50% BSA: 5 mg/ml OVA + 5 mg/ml BSA25% OVA and 75% BSA: 2.5 mg/ml OVA + 7.5 mg/ml BSA0% OVA and 100% BSA: 10 mg/ml BSADilute the beads differentially depending on the readout. For B3Z T cell hybridomas, beads are diluted 1/10 (which corresponds to a bead/cell ratio of approximately 200), while for OT-I T cells the dilution is 1/25 (which corresponds to a bead/cell ratio of 600).The beads are added to BMDC in a final volume of 100 μl. In order to analyze cross-presentation in 10 samples with the 3 different read-outs of this protocol, you will need per condition:10 samples for B3Z → 1 ml of culture medium → 100 μl of beads (1/10 dilution)10 samples for OT-I CD69 expression → 40 μl of beads (1/25 dilution)10 samples for OT-I proliferation → 40 μl of beads (1/25 dilution)Therefore, a final bead volume of 200-250 μl is needed for 10 samples.Put a maximum of 250 μl of beads per 2 ml Eppendorf tube, and wash them with 1.5 ml of PBS.",
    "Centrifuge at 19,000 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Repeat washing twice.Note: If you are assessing 10 samples with the 3 readouts, and doing 4 different conditions of bbOVA (100%, 50%, 25% and 0%) you should have at this point 4 tubes with 200-250 μl of beads (1 for each condition).Discard supernatant, and resuspend the beads in the different protein suspensions as shown in the following (250 μl of beads per 750 μl of soluble protein mix):Stock concentration of OVA: 50 mg/ml (Working concentration: 10 mg/ml)Stock concentration of BSA: 50 mg/ml (Working concentration: 10 mg/ml)Cond. 1) 100% OVA: 0% BSA → 150 μl of OVAstock + 600 μl PBSCond. 2) 50% OVA: 50% BSA → 75 μl of OVAstock + 75 μl of BSAstock + 600 μl PBSCond. 3) 25% OVA: 75% BSA → 37.5 μl of OVAstock + 112.5 μl of BSAstock + 600 μl PBSCond. 4) 0% OVA: 100% BSA → 150 μl of BSAstock + 600 μl PBSIncubate overnight at 4 °C with permanent agitation on a rotator wheel.Washing the beads (Day: 0, sterile environment)Spin the bbOVA with 19,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, discard supernatant with a pipette trying not to touch the beads.Resuspend the bbOVA in 1 ml of cold PBS by pipetting. Centrifuge at 19,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Repeat washing step twice.Resuspend the bbOVA in the original volume (200-250 μl in this example). The beads are ready to use. Keep bbOVA on ice.Loading BMDC with bbOVA, Co-culture with T cells (Day: 0, sterile environment)Plate in 96-well round bottom plates: 100,000 BMDC per well for B3Z readout and 10,000 BMDC per well for both OT-I readouts (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161110/20161110192754_4504.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of an average 96-well plate loaded with BMDCs.",
    "Plate 100,000 BMDCs/well in 50 μl of BMDC culture medium for B3Z readout, or 10,000 cells/well in 50 μl of BMDC culture medium for OT-I readouts. Add the antigen to the right concentration in 50 μl of BMDC culture medium for a final volume of 100 μl. In the scheme, sOVA and SIINFEKL peptide are also analyzed (see Notes 2 and 3). In the scheme, a minimum setup is shown: two different BMDC samples are analyzed, which are plated in duplicates. Additional replicates are suggested to increase robustness of the obtained data.The correct amount of BMDC is plated in 50 μl of BMDC culture medium per well.The final dilution of bbOVA in BMDC culture medium is, as mentioned before: 1/10 for B3Z and 1/25 for OT-I. Please consider that 50 μl of bbOVA in BMDC culture medium will be added to 50 μl of BMDC for a final volume of 100 μl per well. Thereby, bbOVA concentration must be twice the final dilution (1/5 for B3Z, 1/12.5 for OT-I). For the OT-I T cell proliferation readout, incubate BMDC with bbOVA for 1 h at 37 °C. Consequently, cross-presenting BMDC are co-cultured with 60,000-100,000 CFSE-stained OT-I T cells and T cell proliferation is analyzed 72 h later (continues in step 5a).For B3Z and OT-I CD69 expression readouts, incubate BMDC with bbOVA for 4-5 h at 37 °C.Wash the cross-presenting BMDC with 100 μl/well of 0.1% PBS-BSA (always keep reagents and solutions on ice) and centrifuge at 800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Flick the plate and repeat washing twice.Fix cross-presenting BMDC: add 50 μl/well of freshly made PBS-glutaraldehyde (GTA) 0.008% (vol/vol) and incubate for 5 min on ice. Mix cells and PBS-GTA by pipetting.Add 50 μl of PBS-glycine 0.4 M to the PBS-GTA 0.",

Flick the plate.Wash twice with 200 μl/well of B3Z and T cell culture medium (see Recipes). Centrifuge again and flick the plate.Resuspend fixed, cross-presenting BMDC in 100 μl/well of cell culture medium.Add 60,000-100,000 effector cells (B3Z or OT-I, see Notes 4 and 5) per well in 100 μl cell culture medium (to a final volume of 200 μl).Incubate for 16 h at 37 °C for B3Z T cells or for 18-20 h at 37 °C for OT-I T cells.Analysis of B3Z read-out and CD69 expression of OT-I cells (Day: 1)B3Z measurement:Centrifuge at 800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Supernatant can be kept for subsequent cytokine analysis.Wash once with 100 μl/well of 0.1% PBS-BSA, spin down and flick.Add 120 μl/well of CPRG (Chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside). Mix properly to resuspend the B3Z cells.Incubate at 37 °C and check every 30 min until the solution changes its color to orange/red (usually, after 2 h). Measure OD at 590 nm every 30-60 min until the reaction gets saturated (after 4-6 h).Measurement of CD69 expression of OT-I cells:Centrifuge at 800 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Supernatant can be kept for subsequent cytokine analysis.Wash once with 100 μl/well of 0.1% PBS-BSA, spin down and flick the plate.Stain the cells for 15 min at 4 °C with 100 μl/well of fixable viability dye eFluor 780 + Fc block (1/100) in PBS.

    "Cross-presentation of bbOVA by splenic CD8+ dendritic cells, analyzed ex vivo In this protocol, blue dyed beads coated with OVA are injected intravenously into mice. Subsequently, after DC have internalized the particulate antigen and cross-presented it in vivo, spleens are harvested and digested. CD11c+ cells from whole digested spleens are then purified, and the enriched CD11c+ fraction is stained. CD8+ DC that have phagocytosed beads are sorted and co-cultured with OT-I T cells for further analysis (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161110/20161110193845_0183.jpgFigure 3. Workflow of the antigen cross-presentation approach in vivo Preparation of beads (Day: -1)Calculate the number of blue dyed 1.0 μm beads that will be used. 4.5 x 109 beads are injected per mouse (bead stock solution is around 4.5 x 1010 particles/ml). Therefore, 100 μl per mouse are injected.Wash the beads with 1.5 ml cold PBS (again 250 μl of beads per 2 ml Eppendorf tube). Centrifuge at 19,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Repeat.Resuspend each 250 μl of beads in 500 μl of OVA 50 mg/ml, and pool them (if needed) into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Incubate overnight at 4 °C with permanent agitation on a rotator wheel.Washing the beads (Day: 0)For washing purposes, divide the beads in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes (250 μl per tube).Spin the bbOVA at 19,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, discard supernatant with a pipette, trying not to touch the beads.Resuspend the bbOVA in 1.5 ml of cold PBS. Centrifuge at 19,000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Repeat washing step twice.Resuspend the bbOVA in the original volume (250 μl in this example) and pool them. The beads are ready to use. Store them on ice.",
    "Injection of mice, purification of DC and co-culture with T cells (Day: 0) (see Figure 3)Inject 100 μl of beads per mouse intravenously (either in the eye vein or in the tail). Use Terumo 1 ml insulin syringes with 25 G needle. Wait 2 h (time for the bbOVA to be phagocytosed and cross-presented).Sacrifice the mice and harvest spleens.Flush the spleens in non-treated 6-well plates with 2 ml of digestion medium (see Recipes) per spleen by using 25 G needles and 2.5 ml syringes. Incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.Mince the spleens with scalpel blades in the same well and incubate for another 15 min. Stop Liberase/DNAse reaction by adding 2 ml of FBS.Smash and filter the digested spleens through the cell strainer with the flat part of a syringe plunger into 50 ml centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge and discard supernatant.Lyse red blood cells at RT (5 min of 2 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer per spleen is sufficient). Add 30 ml of PBS and centrifuge (350 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).Discard supernatant and resuspend each spleen in 600 μl of cold sorting medium (PBS + 0.5 % FBS). Pass the cells through the suggested Miltenyi pre-separation filters (or similar) and collect them in 14 ml tubes for magnetic purification.In order to isolate CD11c+ cells, we use the EasySep Mouse Pan-DC Enrichment Kit, but any other negative selection-based enrichment procedure might be used. Follow the manufacturer’s indications.Stain the CD11c+-enriched cell fraction for 40 min at 4 °C with 70 μl/well of a combination of CD19-eFluor 450, DAPI, CD3-eFluor 450, CD11c-FITC and CD8-PE (see Note 2).Sort the cells following the gating strategy shown in Figure 4.",
