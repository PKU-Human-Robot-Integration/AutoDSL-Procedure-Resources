    "All procedures were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the European Union (directive 2010/63/EU) and approved by the Charles Darwin Ethical Committee on Animal Experimentation. We describe here the procedure we routinely use in our laboratory, however most steps can be adapted to match everyone's specific needs.\n1. Surgical Preparation\nNote: All incision and pressure points should be repeatedly infiltrated with local anesthetic (lidocaine or bupivacaine). The present procedure is terminal, if an aseptic preparation is required several modifications should be implemented.\nAnesthetize a rat with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and ketamine (50 mg/kg) in two locally separated intraperitoneal (IP) injections.\nLet the animal go under general anesthesia and repeatedly verify that a surgical plane of anesthesia is attained (no reaction to toe pinching). Place the rat on a feedback heating blanket and insert a rectal probe to maintain core temperature around 37 °C.\nPlace a catheter in the peritoneal cavity to facilitate subsequent injection of anesthetic agents and to avoid perforating organs by repeated needle punctures 30.\n\t\nClip the hair over a small (~2 - 3 mm) area above a region located within the stomach's lower right or left quadrant.\n\t\tNote: Depilatory cream can also be used. \nMake a 2 - 3 mm incision on the skin with sharp scissors or a scalpel. Using blunt dissection, remove fat and muscle layers until the peritoneal cavity is observed.\nInsert about 1 - 2 cm of a small catheter in the cavity and close the wound with surgical glue.\n\t\tNote: The diameter and the total length of the catheter should be minimal (e.g., 2 French - corresponding to 0.043 mm inside diameter) to reduce dead volumes. Polyurethane tubes are most suited.\nMake a loop and suture the catheter to the skin to secure it in place.",
    "Install a tracheal tube to control ventilation during artificial respiration.\n\t\nAs for the previous step, prepare the area of interest (1 - 2 cm over the trachea right above the manubrium), remove the hair and incise the skin.\nBlunt dissect the first layers of fat and muscles, then move the salivary gland aside and expose the trachea by gently dissecting the last layer of muscles.\nCarefully remove the tissues over the trachea and slide a thread below it using small forceps. Make a surgeon's knot with the thread but do not tight it yet.\nIncise the trachea transversally between two cartilaginous rings. Swab blood in the trachea if any.\nInsert a tracheal tube with the appropriate diameter and tighten the thread's knot to secure the tube steady. For additional stability the thread can further be attached at a higher point of the trachea tube.\nSuture the wound close or use surgical staples. Avoid surgical glue here if the tracheal tube is intended to be reused.\nInstall the animal in a stereotaxic frame and carefully monitor the following physiological variables: ECoG, SpO2, EtCO2, heart rate (via an electrocardiogram, ECG) and internal temperature. Monitor and adjust these variables to keep a proper depth of anesthesia and physiological state. Specifically, supplement anesthesia with a small dose (10 mg/kg) of sodium pentobarbital if necessary.\nApply eye ointment on both eyes to avoid desiccation. Clip the hair over the scalp, make a longitudinal incision (~2 cm) and resect the connective tissues overlying the skull using a scalpel or a curette.\nMake a small (~1.5 mm diameter) craniotomy over the region of interest with a dental drill.",
    "Note: Here, the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex is targeted ( 7 - 8 mm anterior to the interaural line, 4.5 - 5.5 mm lateral to the midline 31). Rinse repeatedly to dissipate heat.\nUse extra fine forceps to gently make a small hole in the dura. Reserve a ~0.5 mm region within the cranial trepanation to place the ECoG electrode (see next step). Permanently keep the cortex moist with 0.9% NaCl solution (or artificial cerebro-spinal fluid).\nPlace a low impedance (~60 kΩ) silver electrode (the ECoG electrode) on the dura, avoiding the cortical region not covered by the meninges, and place the reference electrode on a scalp muscle on the other side of the head.\nAt this stage (30 min after the last sodium pentobarbital injection), maintain the anesthesia by repeated injections of sodium pentobarbital (10-15 mg/kg/h) or fentanyl (3-6 µg/kg/h) via the IP catheter. The former will result in a slow oscillatory, sleep-like, ECoG pattern whereas the latter will result in a desynchronized, waking-like, cortical profile.\nAdjust the artificial ventilation system so that the respiratory frequency and volume are similar to those of the rat's spontaneous breathing (normal range 70 - 115 breath/min 32). Then, connect the mechanical ventilation to the tracheal tube and verify the proper thoracic cage inflation (on both sides). If not, adjust the position of the ventilation tubing in the tracheal axis. If necessary, suck up the secretion present in the trachea with a catheter connected to a syringe or a vacuum pump.\nIf all physiological variables 32–35 and ECoG 29,36 patterns reflect a stable surgical plane of anesthesia, do an intramuscular injection of gallamine triethiodide in each leg to paralyze the rat, 40 mg/kg for the first injection and then 20 mg/kg, every 2hr 19,29,36,50.\n2. Intracellular Recordings",
    "Pull a glass micropipette (sharp microelectrode) with a ~0.2 µm tip such as its resistance ranges between 50 and 80 MΩ once filled with 2 M potassium acetate (KAc).\nPlace the pipette in a specific holder with a silver/silver-chloride (Ag/AgCl) wire to connect the pipette solution to an intracellular amplifier (via a head stage). The holder should be attached to a micromanipulator. Place a Ag/AgCl reference electrode on the rat's neck muscles.\nSlowly insert the pipette in the brain down to the region of interest and verify its resistance by monitoring the voltage drops in response to current steps. Use the buzz (or zap) button of the amplifier to clear the pipette if needed.\nUse cotton swabs or synthetic absorption triangles to dry the craniotomy (be careful not to touch the ECoG or intracellular electrodes) before covering it with silicone elastomer or 4% agarose to reduce brain movements.\nLower the pipette in 1 - 2 µm steps until its resistance increases when approaching a cell. Then use the buzz function of the amplifier to penetrate into the neuron.\n3. Induce the Isoelectric State\nPerform the appropriate experimental protocol (e.g., firing responses to intracellularly injected currents, current-voltage relations, sensory stimuli responses) at this stage while monitoring simultaneously the neuron's membrane potential, the ECoG and the physiological variables.\nEnsure that the intracellular electrode is stable in the cell by analyzing the steadiness of both the membrane potential and the action potential properties throughout the recording session. If not, do not go to the next step and wait until the recording becomes stable again or search for another neuron.",
    "Inject a high but infra-lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (~90 mg/kg, can be as low as 35 mg/kg from the pentobarbital initial condition and up to 155 mg/kg from the fentanyl initial condition) via the IP line.\n\tNote: Within 15 - 20 min the intracellular and ECoG waveforms should slow down with intermittent electrical silences to transiently reach the so called \"burst-suppression\" profile 37,38, which progressively collapses to a complete isoelectric state. It is expected that the heart rate significantly slows down (by ~10 - 20%) but the SpO2 and EtCO2 should stay relatively steady.\nIf the isoelectric state is not reached, inject a small amount of sodium pentobarbital (~10% of the step 3.1 dose). Wait 15 min before adding more anesthetic if the isoelectric state is still not achieved.\nRepeat the experimental protocol to compare the impact of the network dynamics on the recorded neuron's integrative properties.\n\tNote: After cessation of anesthetic injections, the electrical brain activity should fully recover within 3 to 4 hr.\nAt the end of the experiment, inject a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, IP) to euthanize the rat.\nSubscription Required.
