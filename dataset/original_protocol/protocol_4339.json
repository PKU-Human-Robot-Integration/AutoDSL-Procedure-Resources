    "Note: Some chemicals used in this protocol are highly toxic and should be used only under the fume hood with adequate precautions. Please check the MSDS before using them.Preparation of samples for ultra-thin section transmission electron microscopy requires multiple days. The timeline for the different phases of preparation is shown in Table 1.Table 1. Timeline for preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopyDays 1-7      Growth of M. laminosus (A)Day 8           Fixation and pre-embedding (B); Storage for up to 3 months possibleDays 9-11    Dehydration and embedding in Araldite (C); Indefinite storage possibleDay 12        Sectioning and post-staining (D); Storage for up to 1 year possibleDay 13        Visualization at the transmission electron microscopeGrowth of M. laminosusM. laminosus was grown in gas washing bottles filled with Castenholz D or ND medium (lacking combined nitrogen) (Castenholz, 1988) by bubbling with sterile air. Cultures were kept at 40 °C under constant white light at approximately 20 µE/m2/s until a dense cell mat was visible at the surface (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204004100_6432.jpgFigure 1. Dense cell mat of M. laminosus grown in Castenholz D mediumFixation and pre-embeddingTransfer a piece of the cell mat (corresponding to a volume of approximately 100 µl) into an Eppendorf tube using a 1 ml pipette.Add 1 ml of PB, centrifuge for 2 min at 3,000 x g and remove supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 500 µl of 4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (toxic!) and leave the tube standing for 2 h at room temperature.Centrifuge cells for 2 min at 3,000 x g and remove supernatant. Wash cells 3x in 1 ml of PB with 10 min of incubation time between each step to remove the fixative. Resuspend cells by inverting the tube.Remove supernatant after the final centrifugation step.Resuspend cells in an approximately equal volume of 2% (w/v) liquid agarose (place vial at 60 °C ca.",
    "30 min prior usage to melt the agarose and keep it fluid until usage). Leave sample at room temperature until it is fully polymerized. It is possible to stop the protocol at this step. Samples can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 months.Cut the cell pellet with a razor blade into small cubes of about 1-2 mm length.Transfer cubes to a glass vial and add 2% (w/v) potassium permanganate solution to fully cover the cubes.Incubate for 12 h under gentle shaking at 4 °C.Remove potassium permanganate solution and wash the sample several times for 10 min with distilled water until the supernatant remains clear.Dehydration and embedding in AralditeNote: All incubation steps were performed using a rotator with a rotation speed of 3 rpm.Dehydrate cells by adding 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% (v/v) ethanol for 15 min and 3x 100% (v/v) ethanol for 20 min. Remove ethanol after each incubation step.Incubate the sample for 5 min in propylene oxide (toxic!), remove supernatant and repeat washing step with propylene oxide for 5 min to remove remaining ethanol. Remove supernatant.Add freshly prepared Araldite until the cubes are fully covered and incubate for 1 h.Remove Araldite and replace by a fresh solution of Araldite. Incubate over night.Transfer samples to an embedding mould which is filled with fresh Araldite solution and remove all air bubbles with tweezers.Polymerize samples by placing the Araldite filled embedding moulds for 48 h at 60 °C. After polymerization samples can be stored indefinitely.Sectioning and post-stainingNote: Sectioning requires a lot of experience. Contacting an expert is recommended for beginners.Trim blocks with a razor blade and cut sections of 1 µm thickness with an ultramicrotome.",
    "Transfer a section to a drop of distilled water on a glass slide by using an eyelash attached to a matchstick or a metal loop. Dry section on a hotplate (circa 60 °C).Stain sections with 1% (w/v) toluidine blue for 30 sec on hotplate.Drain excess stain and rinse section briefly with distilled water.Dry on a hotplate and localize cells in a light microscope.Reduce size of block further to get the smallest possible block area including the sample of interest and prepare ultrathin sections of approximately 70 nm thickness.Transfer the sections to a copper grid.Place droplets of saturated aqueous uranyl acetate (toxic!) onto a piece of dental wax in a Petri dish and float the grids (sections downwards) on the droplets for 4 min (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Wash the grids by dipping approximately 10 times into distilled water. Repeat three times. (Video 1)Blot off excess water with the edge of a piece of filter paper, and transfer the grids to droplets of Reynold's lead citrate placed on dental wax. Stain for 4 min (Video 1).Wash with distilled water as described in step 9.Blot off excess water and leave the sections to dry before viewing at the TEM. Grids can be used for TEM at any time. For long-term storage (up to 1 year) grids are kept in grid storage boxes (e.g. SPI Slide-A-GridTM storage box). A sample micrograph is shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204004153_5273.jpgFigure 2. Electron micrograph of an ultra-thin section through a trichome of M. laminosus grown in Castenholz ND medium. Under nitrogen deprivation M. laminosus differentiates photosynthetically active vegetative cells (veg) into nitrogen-fixing heterocysts (het) which possess an additional multilayered envelope (env) as gas diffusion barrier to reduce the entrance of O2 into heterocysts.",
    "When filaments break by the formation of necridia (\"releasing cells\") a small fraction of the former cell remains attached to the trichome (cb). Different membranes are highlighted by black arrows: thylakoid membrane (tm), cytoplasmic membrane (cm) and outer membrane (om). Scale bar, 2 µm"
