    "1. Isolation of Neurospheres from the Adult Mouse Brain\nEuthanize an adult mouse (around 2 months old) by an overdose of isoflurane. Double-check that the mouse has stopped breathing and dissect immediately after death.\nUsing scissors, make a midline incision to open the skull. Remove the brain.\nPlace the brain in cold PBS in a 10 cm dish on ice. Follow the whole-mount dissection method to obtain the SVZ from the lateral ventricle48.\nPlace the lateral ventricle into a 1.5 mL tube, add 500 µL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA in PBS, and incubate the tube for 15 min at 37 °C in a water bath.\nAfter 15 min, add 500 µL of stopping medium and gently pipet 20 - 30 times with a 1 mL tip. Avoid forming air bubbles during pipetting.\n\tNOTE: This step is critical for cell survival.\nSpin down the cells at 500 x g for 8 min. Discard the supernatant, add 1 mL of PBS, and resuspend the cells by gently pipetting 5x with a 1 mL tip.\nSpin down at 500 x g for 8 min. Discard the supernatant using a 1 mL tip and add 1 mL of basal medium.\n(Optional) If cellular debris are observed, pass the cells through a 70 µm cell-strainer.\nCount the number of cells with a hemocytometer; in general, about 30,000 - 60,000 cells/SVZ are obtained.\nPlate the cells from one SVZ into a 10 cm dish with 10 mL of NSC medium and culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n(Optional) To avoid fusion between spheres49, put 1,000 cells in a single well of an ultra-low-binding 6-well plate that is prefilled with 1.5 mL of NSC medium and culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE: After 5-7 days, neurospheres can be observed (Figure 2A). The culturing period may differ with the age of mouse or the genetic background.\nAdd 2 mL of NSC medium every 3-4 days to maintain the culture (do not remove the existing medium).\n2. Analysis of the Differentiation Capacity of Neurospheres and Ciliogenesis Tests\nTo analyze the differentiation capacity, analyze the neurospheres under adherent conditions in differentiation medium.\nSterilize 12 mm round coverslips by autoclaving or with UV exposure prior to use. For an adherent cell culture, put a sterilized 12 mm round cover glass into a well of a 24-well plate under aseptic conditions.\nCoat the cover glass for 10 s with 500 µL of 0.002% poly-L-Lysine (PLL). Aspirate the solution and dry it for 10-15 min.\nAdd 500 µL of laminin solution (5 µg/µL). Incubate the cover glass for 1 h at 37 °C.\nAspirate the laminin and add 500 µL of differentiation medium or NSC medium (undifferentiated control).\nFor the differentiation assay, pick up a 100 - 200 µm sphere with a 200 µL tip under the microscope. Add 5-10 neurospheres to each well of a 24-well plate and culture for 7-10 days in differentiation medium.\nTo analyze undifferentiated neurospheres, add 5-10 neurospheres to each well of a 24-well plate and culture for 1-2 days in NSC medium. Attached neurospheres spread and grow as a monolayer (Figure 2B).\nAfter carefully removing the medium, fix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at RT, and then wash with PBS twice for 5 min at RT. The plate can be stored at 4 °C for 1-2 months.",
    "NOTE: To visualize neural stem/progenitor cells in NSC medium and differentiated cells in differentiation medium, perform immunostaining against Nestin (neural stem/progenitor cell marker), β–tubulin III (TUJ1 monoclonal, neuronal marker), GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, astrocyte marker), and O4 (oligodendrocyte marker) (Figure 2B-E). To analyze the cilia, perform immunostaining against Arl13b (primary cilia marker) and Gpr161 (ciliary GPCR) (Figure 3).\nMount the cover glass with mounting solution onto a slide glass. Tilt the slide glass to remove excess solution.\n3. Analysis of Ciliogenesis in Neurospheres\nTo analyze cells in intact neurospheres by immunostaining, transfer 1 mL of culturing medium containing multiple neurospheres to a 1.5 mL tube and spin down at 500 x g for 8 min. Fix the spheres with 4% (PFA) after removing the medium for 15 min and wash with PBS. Spin down spheres at 500 x g for 8 min, remove supernatant, and incubate the spheres O/N with 30% sucrose at 4°C. \nDiscard the supernatant using a 1 mL tip and add 500 µL of OCT solution using a cut 1 mL tip. Cut the edge of the tip to widen the opening, as OCT is viscous.\nTransfer the OCT solution containing the neurospheres into a disposable plastic freezing mold (10 mm x 10 mm x 5 mm).\nFreeze the mold on dry ice for at least 15 min.\n(Optional) Stop the experiment and store the mold in a -80 °C freezer for up to 1 year.\nCut the sections with a cryostat; the thickness of sections should be 15-30 µm.\nTo visualize the primary cilia in a neurosphere, perform immunostaining against Arl13b (Figure 4).\n4. Culture and Passage of Neurospheres and Adherent NSCs",
    "Passage the neurospheres while the sphere size is between 100-200 µm; when the neurospheres are too big (300 µm or above), they are not ideal for experiments.\nTransfer the neurospheres into a 50 mL tube using a 1 mL tip and spin down at 500 x g for 8 min.\nDiscard the supernatant using an aspirator, add 500 µL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA in PBS, and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. The amount of trypsin varies depending on the number of spheres.\nAdd 500 µL of serum medium and gently pipet 20 times with a 1 mL tip.\nSpin down at 500 x g for 8 min. Discard the supernatant using a 1 mL tip and add 1 mL of basal medium.\n(Optional) If cellular debris or undissociated neurospheres are seen, pass the cells through a 70 µm cell-strainer.\nPassage the cells in a 10 cm dish at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in NSC medium; the cells will be ready for the next passage after a week.\n(Optional) To freeze the cells, add freezing medium to generate 500,000 to 1,000,000 cells/mL suspension. Freeze the cells using cryo-freezing containers; undissociated neurospheres can also be frozen.\nFor the adherent culture, dillute the cells to 50,000 cells/cm2 onto PLL- and Laminin-coated coverslips with NSC medium, and culture for 1-2 days.\n5. Starvation and Analysis of Cilia\nPrepare starvation medium (Table 1).\n1-2 days after the initial plating of adherent cells after dissociation, change to NSC medium in one well (control) and starvation medium in another well (experiment).\nCulture the adherent cells for 24 h.\nFix the cells with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min at RT and wash twice with PBS for 5 min each at RT.",
    "(Optional) Stop the experiment and store the 24-well plates with coverslips in PBS at 4 °C for 1-2 months.\nPerform an immunofluorescence protocol for staining7,50.\nMount the coverslips using mounting solution. Dry the slide glass O/N at RT in the dark.\nAcquire images on a compound microscope at the necessary magnification. Use a microscope, a camera, and objectives (40X/1.3 oil and 63X/1.4 oil), controlled using the accompanied software. Take sufficient z-sections at 0.5-0.8 µm intervals (Figure 5).\nFor the quantitative analysis of ciliary localization in adherent cells, acquire stacks of images from 3-8 consecutive fields with confluent cells by looking into the DAPI channel. Quantify the number of primary cilia using ImageJ/Fiji. Typically, use the \"Cell counter\" tool in the ImageJ Plugins>Analyze dialog box to count the cells with GPCR-positive cilia; maximal projections from stacks of images can also be exported from ImageJ/Fiji.Use similar image intensity and contrast parameters for all images from the same experiment for counting and exporting purposes.\n6. Transfection of Neurospheres\nAdhere dissociated cells to coverslips for 24 h. Use a cell density typically between 75,000 and 150,000 cells in 500 µL of NSC medium in a single well of a 24-well plate.\nMix 25 µL of reduced serum medium and 1.5 µL of transfection reagent in a 0.5 mL microtube by vortexing for 5 s.\nAdd 2.5 µg of endotoxin-free plasmid DNA to a separate 0.5 mL microtube containing 25 µL of reduced serum media and mix by vortexing for 5 s.\nAdd 1 µL of transfection reagent to the second microtube containing DNA and mix by vortexing for 5 s.\nAdd the mixture from the DNA-containing tube to the first microtube and mix by pipetting.",
    "Incubate the mixture for 10-15 min at RT. After incubation, gently add the transfection mix dropwise to the wells on top of the NSC medium (500 µL/well).\nChange the medium 24 h post-transfection to control medium (NSC medium) or starvation medium (500 µL/well).\nFix the cells by changing the medium to 4% PFA after 24 h and perform immunostaining; typically, up to a 10% transfection efficiency is obtained using this protocol.\nSubscription Required.
