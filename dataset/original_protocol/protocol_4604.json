    "Preparation of the query file and local databaseFor a given plant genome of interest, do the following:Download all CDS and protein sequences of all protein-coding genes from a relevant database such as phytozome (http://www.phytozome.org/[href=http://www.phytozome.org/]) (Goodstein et al., 2012). Make sure that each gene has the same name in both CDS and protein sequence files.Download the HMM profile and the extended amino acid sequence for NB-ARC domain (Pfam no. PF00931) from the Pfam database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/[href=http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/]) (Finn et al., 2014). Download all microRNA sequences from a relevant database such as miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org/[href=http://www.mirbase.org/]) (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014) or prepare a fasta file including all the microRNA sequences obtained in house experiments. Create a local database of your downloaded protein sequences for blast search using the formatdb program of the blast software (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi[href=http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi]).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151102/20151102232350_9699.jpgFigure 1. A flow chart of the steps described in our procedureComputational identification of NBS genesPerform the HMM search against the fasta file that contains protein sequences you downloaded using the hmmsearch.exe program in the hmmer 3.0 package (Johnson et al., 2010) with the HMM profile of NB-ARC domain as a query in default settings. Run a local BLASTp search against the protein database that was created in the procedure step A4 using the amino acid sequence of the NB-ARC domain as a query. The threshold expectation value was set to 1.0 as used in previous studies (Li et al., 2010; Shao et al., 2014).Retrieve the gene name of potential NBS genes from the results of HMM search and BLAST search and combined them together to obtain the maximal number of hits. These gene names are used to retrieve the protein sequences from protein dataset downloaded in procedure step A1. This step could be achieved manually if only a few NBS genes are found in the genome.",
    "For large datasets, we recommend the researchers writing a Perl script for this step (a script is also available from the authors upon request).The obtained sequences are further subjected to the online Pfam analysis to verify whether they indeed possess the NBS domain, with the E-value setting to 10-4 (Figure 2A). Sequences that do not have a detectable NB-ARC domain are discarded. The remaining sequences represent all NBS proteins of the dataset. The Pfam analysis is also important to detect whether these proteins have an N-terminal toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain or RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW8 (RPW8) domain or a C-terminal LRR domain (Meyers et al., 2003). Protein sequences that do not have a detectable N-terminal domain by Pfam are further analyzed using the COILS Server (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html[href=http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html]) (Lupas et al., 1991) in default settings to detect whether they have a coiled-coils domain at the N-terminal.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151102/20151102232429_5800.jpgFigure 2. Screen shots for steps A) B5, and B) C2Identification of NBS genes potentially targeted by microRNAsTo predict NBS genes targeted by microRNAs, retrieve the CDS sequences of identified NBS genes by searching gene names from the downloaded CDS dataset. Submit the sequences corresponding to CDS of identified NBS genes and to microRNAs to the psRNATarget Server (http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/[href=http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/]) (Dai and Zhao, 2011) in fasta format for microRNA target prediction (Figure 2B). Note: At this step, researchers can change the parameter settings to restrict or expand the number of predicted targets. For example, one can set the Maximum expectation (transformed from mismatch penalty) to 3 to obtain fewer hits with lower false positive prediction rate; or set the Maximum expectation to 5 to maximize the number of potential targets at a higher risk of false positive prediction rate.Download the prediction results from the psRNATarget Server and retrieve those NBS genes predicted to be targeted by microRNAs.",
    "The predicted regulation of NBS genes by microRNAs could be experimentally validated by co-expression of them in tobacco leaves as described in several studies (Liu et al., 2014; Yu and Pilot, 2014)."
