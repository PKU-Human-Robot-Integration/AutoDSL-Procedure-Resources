    "The skin punch biopsy obtained using standard procedure3 (e.g. obtained with 4mm round Visipunch instrument) should be kept in complete DMEM 20% FBS media on ice. Once the sample has arrived in the laboratory, process the biopsy as soon as possible.\n1. Preparation of the Skin Punch Biopsy\nSTEPS 1.1- 1.3 ARE TO BE PERFORMED INSIDE A BIOSAFETY CABINET\nPrepare in advance: Add 1 ml of 0.1% Gelatin to each well of a 6-well plate. Set the plate aside for 30-60 min. Aspirate the gelatin solution and add 800 μl of complete DMEM/20% FBS media to each well. Ensure that the entire surface of the well is covered with media. \nInvert the lid of a sterile 10 cm tissue culture dish and add 1.5 ml of DMEM/ 20% FBS media to the middle of the lid and spread out the media drop with the tip of the serological pipette.    \nUsing a sterile forceps, place the skin biopsy piece in the media on the dish. \n2. Dissection of the Skin Punch Biopsy\nSTEPS 9 2.1-2.2 ARE TO BE PERFORMED INSIDE A HORIZONTAL LAMINAR FLOW HOOD\nPlace the bottom portion of 10 cm dish on inverted lid, and transfer the skin biopsy to the dissecting microscope in the laminar flow hood.  \nDissect a 4-mm round skin biopsy into 12-15 evenly sized pieces with sharp edges by cutting pieces in equal halves using one scalpel to hold the biopsy in place and the second scalpel to cut with a rolling motion in one direction. Pieces with ragged edges contribute to poor attachment/cell outgrowth. \n3. Transfer of Dissected Skin Biopsy Pieces into Tissue Culture Plates       \nSTEPS 3.1-3.6 ARE TO BE PERFORMED INSIDE A BIOSAFETY CABINET",
    "Place the bottom portion of the 10 cm tissue culture dish on top of the inverted lid, and transfer dish back into to the biosafety cabinet.\nUsing a pointed forceps, place 2-3 biopsy pieces into each well of the prepared 6-well plate containing 800 μl and not on dry wells. Use tapping or sliding motion to get the pieces to attach to the bottom of the well. A scalpel is useful to remove any biopsy pieces from the forceps.  \nPlace the 6-well plate in the 37 °C incubator. Monitor daily to ensure there is a film of media coating the bottom of the well for the first week; add ~200  μl every 2 days to replace any evaporated media.\nAfter one week, increase amount of media to 2 ml of complete DMEM/20%FBS and change media every 2-3 days. \nOnce fibroblasts are confluent in each well to the point where the fibroblasts are reaching the edges of the well, trypsinize and passage 6-well plate into 2X T75 flasks (passage 1). The tissue pieces can be transferred as well. They will not attach and be washed out during the next media change.    \nOnce fibroblasts are confluent, transfer them to 3X T175 flasks (passage 2), freeze in  complete DMEM media plus 10% DMSO at 1x106 cells/ml per vial. \n4. Characterization the Fibroblasts through Immunostaining\nCulture fibroblasts in 8 well chamber slide coated with gelatin.\nWhen cells are at 80% confluency, aspirate the medium from each well.\nFix cells in 4% Paraformaldehyde for ten minutes at room temperature. \n Wash the wells 3 times with 1X PBS.\nPermeabilize the cells with 150 μl of 0.3% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature. \nWash the wells 3 times with 1X PBS.",
    "Add 200 μl blocking solution (PBS + 5% Normal Goat Serum (Vector, S-1000)) for 1 hr at room temperature.\nPrepare a 1:250 dilution of Anti-SERPHIN-1 (Anti-rabbit, mAB, Sigma, S5950-200 μl) in blocking solution.\nAspirate the blocking solution, and add 150 μl of the 1:250 dilution of AntiSERPINH-1. Incubate at 1-2 hr at room temperature, or at 4 °C overnight. \nWash the wells 3 times with 1X PBS.\nPrepare a 1:200 goat-anti-rabbit monoclonal antibody (Alexa Fluor Goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L), Invitrogen, A11008) in blocking solution. \nAdd 150 μl of 1:200 goat-anti-rabbit monoclonal antibody to each well. Incubate for 1 hr, in dark, at room temperature. \nWash wells once with 1xPBS. \nAspirate the PBS, and carefully lift the chambers off to reveal just the slide.\nMount the slide with a 2-3 drops of mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector, H-1200).\nAnalyze the slide under a fluorescent microscope. \nSubscription Required.
