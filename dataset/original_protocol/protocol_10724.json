    "1. Plants\nSurface-sterilize bean seeds (cv. Calima) by immersing them for two minutes in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite and two minutes in 70% ethanol. Rinse the seeds three times in sterile distilled water.\nEvaluate the success of your sterilization by plating 100 μl of the last rinsing water on potato dextroxe agar (PDA) media, and incubating the plate for 10 days at 25 °C. Terminate and restart the experiment if any growth is seen on the plate. \nPlant the seeds in groups of three in pots containing a sterile mixture of soil and sand at a 2:1 ratio. Transfer the pots to a growth chamber at 25 °C, ca. 50% RH and 12 hr photoperiod. One week after germination, eliminate the two least vigorous seedlings. Water every 2-3 days with sterile distilled water and fertilize 10 and 20 days after planting with a 6 g/L water solution of NPK 15-15-15 fertilizer. \n2. Fungus\nObtain a commercial formulation of Beauveria bassiana strain GHA (Mycotrol SE, Laverlam, Cali, Colombia).    \nTo generate a single-spore stock culture, suspend ca. one inoculating loop full of conidia in 1 ml of a 0.1% water solution of Triton-X 100 and vortex for 10 sec. Then, plate 100 μl of the suspension on 2.5% Noble agar and incubate for 24 hr at 25 °C. Transfer a single germinating conidium into a 100 mm plate containing PDA and grow until it covers the entire plate (ca. 3-4 weeks).\nUnder sterile conditions, scrape the fungal growth from the surface of the medium and suspend it in 10 ml sterile 0.1% Triton-X 100.  Vortex for one minute. Then, filter the suspension through a sterile cheesecloth to remove hyphae and obtain the stock suspension.",
    "Use a hemocytometer to estimate the conidial concentration of the stock suspension.  To facilitate conidial counts, prepare a 10,000-fold serial dilution of the stock, each time transferring 100 μl of conidial suspension in 900 μl of 0.1% Triton-X 100, and vortexing for 10 sec before the next dilution. \nTo generate the inoculum, adjust the stock suspension to a final concentration of 108 conidia/ml, using the formula: \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50360/50360eq1.jpg \nTo assess conidial viability, plate 100 μl of the 10,000-fold dilution on 2.5% Noble agar and incubate for 24 hr at 25 °C. Then, inspect three random groups of 100 conidia to estimate percent germination. Consider a conidium germinated when a visible germ tube longer than half the diameter of the conidium projects from it. Only use the suspension when the average percent germination exceeds 90%. \n3. Inoculation\nInoculate plants when they reach their first true leaf stage (ca. 14 days after planting). Water plants to soil capacity with sterile distilled water 24 hr before inoculations.\nFor the foliar spray method, use a manual atomizer to apply the conidial suspension (treatment) or 0.1% Triton-X 100 (control) to the adaxial (upper) surface of leaves until they reach saturation. Cover the top of the pot with aluminum foil to avoid conidial runoff to the soil. After spraying, cover plants with a plastic bag for 24 hr to maintain a high level of humidity facilitating fungal invasion. \nFor the soil drench method, use a graduated cylinder to apply 10 ml of conidial suspension (treatment) or 0.1% Triton-X 100 (control) to the surface of the soil at the base of the plant.",
    "After inoculations, return plants to the growth chambers arranging them in a randomized complete block design. No less than four additional experimental blocks should be installed to allow evaluations of plant growth, in addition to evaluations of endophytic colonization, in the same experiment. \n4. Evaluations\nEvaluate the experiment one block at a time, selecting the blocks in random order. This is particularly important for large experiments that cannot be evaluated on a single day.\nBefore processing a plant, measure and record its height from the base to the apical meristem. Then, uproot carefully and wash thoroughly in running tap water. \nFrom each plant, sample two leaflets, two pieces of root and two pieces of stem. Select leaflet samples randomly from the first true leaf of the plant. Then, obtain two stem samples, 3 cm-long each, from the middle of the plant and from near the soil surface. Finally, obtain two taproot samples, also 3 cm-long each, from the middle of the root and from 1 cm behind the root tip. Place the samples on three separate paper bags and label appropriately. \nAfter washing and sampling all the plants in a block, start by processing the leaves, then roots, and finally the stems.\nSurface sterilize tissues in a sterile laminar flow hood as in 1.1, above.  Rinse each sample three times by immersion in sterile distilled water and let it dry in sterile towel paper. Then, dissect and discard its outer edges, where endophytes might have been eliminated due to contact with disinfectants.",
    "Cut the trimmed sample into six sections, averaging 6x6 mm for leaves and 6 mm-long for stems and roots. Plate the six sections on a 60 mm Petri plate with PDA media supplemented with the antibiotics tetracycline, streptomycin and penicillin at 2 mg/L each. Seal the plate with parafilm and incubate in the dark at 25 °C. Each plant yields six plates, two per plant part. \nChange the rinse water after processing each block of a given plant part. Before discarding the used rinsing water, plate a 100 μl sample on PDA media and incubate for 10 days at 25 °C to assess sterilization success. If fungal growth ensues, do not consider the corresponding samples for analyses. \nInspect the plates every 2-3 days for 20 days to observe and record fungal growth. Excise and transfer plant sections exhibiting presence of fungal endophytes to plates containing fresh PDA.  This will avoid contamination of neighboring plant sections in the original plate.    \nRecord B. bassiana growth from plant sections. Beauveria bassiana can be identified by characteristic white dense mycelia becoming cream to pale yellow at the edge. When in doubt, mount the specimen in a drop of water and inspect under a microscope, looking for globose conidia and zigzag-shaped conidiophores, characteristic of the species. \nUse additional experimental blocks to evaluate the impact of the treatments on plant biomass. First, measure their height from the base to the top of the apical meristem. Then, carefully uproot and wash plants in tap water and let them dry at 45 °C for three days to determine their dry weight."
