    "Infection and transfectionPerform all work in a class 2 biosafety cabinet.Seed 1 × 106 293A cells/well in 2 ml D10 media (Recipes 4 and 5) in a 6-well plate (Note 3).We found this cell number to be ideal for achieving 70% confluency and active cell growth, the desired conditions for transfection. Incubate cells overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2.The next day, thaw VACV stock at room temperature.Note: This should be the parent vaccinia stock that is to be modified. Sonicate virus stock 3 times (20 s each, 5 s break in between) on ice.Dilute virus stock to 5 × 104 pfu/ml in D0 media (see Recipe 1), allowing 1 ml for each well. This gives in the order of 0.05 pfu/cell, based on the number of cells plated.Aspirate media from 293A cells and replace with diluted virus.Incubate cells for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.Note: Rocking of plates during virus inoculations such as these is routine in some laboratories but is unnecessary at any stage of this protocol. Dilute 2 µg recombinant plasmid DNA in 120 µl D0 media and incubate at room temperature for 10 min (Table 1). Label tube “Mix 1”.Note recombinant plasmids can be synthesized using any desired method (see Note 2).Recommended: It is advised to perform transfections in duplicate, so as to have two distinct lineages of virus and ensure acquisition of desired recombinant.Table 1. Preparation of DNA for transfection (Mix 1) table:\n﻿0,1,2\nComponent,Volume (µl),Volume (µl)\nComponent,Per well,3 wells\nPlasmid DNA,2 µg,6 µg\nD0 media,Up to 120,Up to 360\nTotal,120,360\nPrepare “Mix 2” by adding 4 µl LipofectamineTM 2000 reagent to 200 µl D0 media and leave for 5 min (Table 2).Table 2.

    "Combine “Mix 1” and “Mix 2” to a final volume of 320 µl/well and incubate at room temperature for 20-30 min.After 1 h incubation, remove virus-containing media from cells and discard.Add 680 µl fresh D0 media to each well.In a dropwise manner, add 320 µl of DNA/LipofectamineTM mix to each well and rock the plate gently.Incubate plate for 4 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.Remove media and replace with 2 ml D2 media (see Recipes 2 and 3).Incubate plate for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.At 24 h post-infection, collect cells and supernatant by pipetting up and down vigorously and transferring to a 2 ml cryogenic vial.Note: If strongly adherent cells are used, cells can be scraped into the media. Freeze cells and supernatant rapidly using a dry-ice/ethanol bath, and thaw using a 37°C waterbath or heat block. Cycle through freezing and thawing three times to release virus (or store at -80°C till ready for Cas9 selection).Proceed to Section B for selection of recombinant viruses.Cas9 selectionPerform all work in a class 2 biosafety cabinet.Seed 1 × 106 293A cells/well in a 6-well plate and incubate overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2.Allow for 6 wells per tube of collected cells from A (see Note 4).For selection, prepare ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes of Cas9 and gRNA by mixing the components in Table 3.Note: gRNAs should be kept on ice and used in aliquots to prevent repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Table 3. Preparation of Cas9/gRNA RNP complexes table:\n﻿0,1,2\nComponent,Volume (µl),Volume (µl)\nComponent,Per well,6 wells\n\"Cas9 nuclease, S. pyogenes (NEB)\",0.67,4\n10× Cas9 nuclease reaction buffer (NEB),0.67,4\ngRNA (2 µg/µl),1.00,6\nNuclease-free water,4.33,26\nTotal,6.67,40",
    "Incubate Cas9/gRNA RNP mix for 10 min at room temperature, then add D0 media for a total of 120 µl per well (e.g., for 6 wells this is 680 µl of D0, for a total volume of 720 µl).During the incubation in step B4, prepare LipofectamineTM 2000 mix as in Table 2 to a final volume of 200 µl per well.Combine Cas9/gRNA mix and LipofectamineTM 2000 giving a final volume of 320 µl (120 µl RNP + 200 µl LipofectamineTM 2000) per well and let sit for 20-30 min.Remove media from cells and replace with 680 µl fresh D0 media.In a dropwise manner, add 320 µl of Cas9/LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection mix to each well.Incubate for 4 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.Using the freeze-thawed tubes of virus from A (which should include the desired recombinant), sonicate 3 times for 20 s each on ice, with 5 s breaks.Prepare 1/5 serial dilutions of virus in 1.25 ml D0 media, changing tip between each tube. Start with a 1/25 dilution (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4270/bioprotoc-11-24-4270-g002.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of 1/5 serial dilutions for plating out virus. Take 50 µl of virus stock after freeze-thawing and use to make a 1/25 virus dilution in D0 media. Take 250 µl of this stock and add to a further tube containing 1 ml D0 media. Continue until 6 dilutions have been prepared, up to 1/78125.Aspirate media from cells at 4 h post-transfection and add 1 ml of each virus dilution.Incubate for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.Replace virus with 2 ml fresh D2 media (or D2 without phenol red if you wish to observe fluorescence) and incubate for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.",
    "Optional: If a visual marker is included in the recombinant virus design, wells with higher dilutions can be examined by microscopy to identify and count plaques that have the marker and those with parent phenotype to assess frequency of desired recombinant.Note: If enough virus with the desired marker is seen at this stage a single round of selection might be adequate and steps B18-B21 can be skipped. Use an inverted microscope to look for evidence of virus infection (cytopathic effect, CPE). Starting from the most- to least-infected, identify the first well in which the CPE is not uniform across the monolayer (Figure 3). Collect cells and supernatant from this well by pipetting up and down vigorously (scraping first if necessary) and transfer to a 2 ml cryogenic vial.Optional: Wells on either side can be harvested similarly and kept as back-ups.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4270/bioprotoc-11-24-4270-g003.jpgFigure 3. Cytopathic effect as an indicator of appropriate well selection at 48 h post-VACV infection. Cytopathic effect seen on a Cas9 selection plate with the well chosen to harvest indicated with the red box. In this instance, the chosen dilution is 1/625 but this varies across experiments. Scale bar in bottom right frame = 300 µm.Freeze-thaw 3 times and sonicate 3 times as above.Prepare new plates of Cas9/gRNA-transfected 293A cells by repeating steps B1-B9.Note: Ideally the cells should be prepared to be ready to transfect on the day the virus is harvested from the first round of selection. Use virus collected in Step B16 to prepare serial 5-fold dilutions in 1.25 ml D0 media, starting with a 1/25 dilution (Figure 2).At 4 h post-transfection, remove media and replace with 1 ml of each virus dilution.Complete the incubations and harvesting of virus as in steps B13-B16.",
    "Optional: Where there is colour or another marker in the final virus and there are well-separated plaques of the desired phenotype visible on these cultures, it is possible to proceed directly to step C9 and collect the progeny of individual plaques instead of harvesting a whole well.Freeze stocks at -80°C until ready to use.Note: A third round of selection can be performed if recombinant viruses are not adequately enriched after this stage. Proceed to Section C for identification and purification of recombinants.Isolation of recombinant virusesPerform all work in a class 2 biosafety cabinet.Plate BS-C-1 cells to confluency in a 6-well plate in 2 ml D10 media (6 wells per plaque to be tested; see Note 5).The following day, take virus collected after 2 rounds of Cas9 selection and sonicate 3 times as above.Serially dilute collected virus 1/10 in 1.2 ml D0 media.

    "Remove media from cells and add 1 ml virus stock to each well.Incubate plate at 37°C for 1 h, 5% CO2.After 1 h, aspirate media and replace with 2 ml 4% CMC/D2 (see Recipe 6).Incubate for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.Locate plaques using an inverted microscope. If the desired recombinant has fluorescent or other visible markers, use an appropriate method to identify plaques that contain the marker.Mark location of desired plaques using an ultra-fine permanent marker on the bottom of the 6-well plate.Plaques should be taken from the most dilute well possible and should be well-spaced from other plaques. It is recommended to mark a minimum of 10 plaques.Return plate to biosafety cabinet.Insert a pipette into the well above the marked area and aspirate 10 µl, whilst scraping to collect virus from a plaque. Virus collected by this method is referred to hereafter as a “plaque isolate”.Transfer plaque isolate to a 2 ml Sarstedt tube containing 500 µl D10 media.Repeat for all marked plaques.Plaques can be stored at -80°C.Proceed to Section D to screen these isolates by PCR (necessary for marker-free recombinants), or directly to Section E if a visual marker allows identification of plaques with recombinant virus.Screening of plaque isolates by PCR (marker-free recombinants)Plate BS-C-1 cells to confluency in wells of a 96-well plate (one well per plaque to be tested) (see Note 6).Take 10-50 µl from each plaque isolate in C and add to 200 µl D2 media.Remove media from cells and replace with the diluted virus.Incubate plate for 3 days at 37°C, 5% CO2.Examine cells for presence of CPE and/or expression of markers under a microscope.Remove media from wells with CPE and wash with 150 µl PBS, without disturbing cells.",
    "Lyse cells by adding 10 µg/ml Proteinase K (Invitrogen) in 100 µl 1× ThermoPol® buffer (New England Biolabs) to each well and incubating for 5 minutes at room temperature.Freeze plate at -80°C, then thaw at room temperature.Heat samples using a 56°C heating block for 20 min.Heat samples at 85°C for 10 min to inactivate Proteinase K, using a heating block.Note: It is essential that the sample is at 85°C for the full 10 min. Take 2 µl of each sample to perform a PCR.Design primers to distinguish recombinant and parent viruses (see example in Figure 4).Optional: Incorporate novel restriction sites during recombinant plasmid design to aid in the identification of recombinants with close similarity to the parent virus.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4270/bioprotoc-11-24-4270-g004.jpgFigure 4. Confirming identity of recombinant viruses by PCR. A. To check for recombination events. B. Design forward (FW) and reverse (REV) primers to differentiate wild-type and recombinant viruses. C. Screen individual plaque isolates and final cultures to check for wild-type (WT) virus. Choose a strategy to unambiguously differentiate between parent and recombinant virus. In this example, a second primer pair that only amplifies the foreign DNA can be of value.Prepare PCR mixtures as follows (Table 5):Table 5. Preparation of PCR master mix table:",

    "Perform PCRs using a thermocycler set to conditions appropriate for amplification.Note: Optimise thermocycling conditions to your specific primers and template size prior to virus screening. Run 10 µl of each sample with 2 µl 6× Loading dye on a 1-2% UltraPureTM agarose gel with SYBRTM Safe staining to check for DNA amplification.Optional: If plaques after marker-screening or PCR only show the desired virus, or if the edit to the genome is too small to be detected by a differential set of PCR primers, sequencing of PCR products that include the edited region of the genome can be done to further validate or identify plaques of interest.Proceed to Section E for purification of recombinant viruses.Further plaque purification to obtain recombinant virus seed stocksPerform all work in a class 2 biosafety cabinet.Seed BS-C-1 cells to confluency in a 6-well plate (6 wells per plaque isolate to be purified).Serially dilute plaque isolates, which were identified by marker expression or in Section D as containing the desired recombinant, in 1.2 ml D0 media (Table 4).Aspirate media from BS-C-1 cells and add 1 ml of each virus dilution.Incubate plate at 37°C for 1 h, 5% CO2.Remove media and replace with 2 ml 4% CMC/D2.Incubate plate for 48-72 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.Examine plates under a microscope for plaque formation.Collect plaque isolates into 500 µl D10 media as in C and freeze-thaw 3 times.Note: If using a marker-free virus, the identity of each plaque isolate should be confirmed by PCR and/or sequencing. Repeat steps E1-E9. Each repetition is considered a ‘round’ of plaque purification.If picking multiple plaques at each step, label numerically to trace lineage, i.e.",
    ", if using plaque isolate 1 from the 1st round, plaque isolate 3 from the 2nd round, and plaque isolate 4 from the 3rd round, label could read “Plaque pick 1-3-4” etc.Conventionally, 3 rounds of plaque purification are adequate for a virus stock to be considered pure. However, we have found that virus from the first plaques picked after selection (Section C) are sometimes entirely free of parent virus by PCR and in these cases one or two additional rounds of purification may be sufficient.Recommended: For marker-free viruses, take 1-2 µl of the final purified virus and add to BS-C-1 cells in a 96-well plate. Culture for 3 days and extract DNA as above (Section D). Use PCR to check for any contaminating parent virus (Figure 3C).This plaque suspension can be considered a seed stock, or it can be expanded using 100 µl to infect a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask of cells that are preferred for growing general VACV stocks. Allow growth for 3 days as usual (37°C, 5% CO2)."
