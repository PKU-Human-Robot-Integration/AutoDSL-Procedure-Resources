    "This animal study (#AP17P004) was performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Nihon University Animal Care and Use Committee (Tokyo, Japan). This study (#17-0001) was approved by the Radioisotope Center of the School of Pharmacy, Nihon University.\n1. Animals Used for Intranasal Administration Under Inhalation Anesthesia\nHouse the experimental mice in stainless-steel cages under a 12-h light/dark cycle (light on 8:00 AM–8:00 PM), with a controlled temperature maintained at 23 ± 1°C, humidity of 50% ± 10%, and ad libitum access to food and water.\nPrior to experimentation, anesthetize the mice via inhalation of 2% isoflurane, following initiation at a concentration of 4%. Confirm the requisite level of anesthetization by checking for the disappearance of surface righting.  \n2. Preparation of the Administration Solution\nPrepare an administration solution of [14C]-inulin (50 μM, 0.5 μCi/mL per mouse) by diluting in phosphate-buffered saline, and store at 4 °C until use.\n3. Intranasal Administrations for Mice\nMicropipette method using a temporarily openable inhalation mask (Figure 1)\n\tNote: This technique is a modification of the intranasal administration protocol using a micropipette established by Frey et al.3\nFix mice in the supine position on a corkboard by taping their limbs under inhalation anesthesia with 2% isoflurane (Figure 1A).\nAdminister a total volume of 25-μL administration solution to each mouse at 30-s intervals, via 1- to 2-μL doses alternatively administered into the left and right nostrils while the mice are fixed under inhalation anesthesia (Figure 1B and C).\nNote: Waste anesthetic gas is scavenged by active means (fume hood, hard-ducted biosafety cabinet, vacuum, etc.) when the  mask is opened and by passive means(waste anesthetic gas cannister)  when closed \nReverse cannulation method from the airway side through the esophagus (Figure 2)",
    "Note: This technique is a modification of the intranasal absorption protocol for rats established by Hirai et al.7\nFix mice in the supine position on a corkboard by taping their limbs under inhalation anesthesia with 2% isoflurane.\nHair in the neck is shaved and prepped via betadine or chlorhexidine application followed by an alcohol rinse.\nExpose the trachea and esophagus by expanding the skin below the throat with forceps after making a small incision (1.5 cm) with scissors.\nMake an incision (1 mm) in the trachea using scissors.\nInsert a cannula (internal diameter: 0.58 mm, exterior diameter: 0.965 mm) to a length of 1.2 cm and attach the opposite end of the cannula to the inside of the inhalation mask.\nMake an incision (1 mm) in the esophagus using scissors, insert a cannula (internal diameter: 0.28 mm, exterior diameter: 0.61 mm) to a length of 1.4 cm toward the posterior part of the nasal cavity, and ligate it (Figure 2A and B).\n\t\tNote: Procedures 3.2.2 to 3.2.4 were carried out under a stereoscopic microscope at ×10 magnification.\nAttach a needle (27G × 1/2) to a 1-mL syringe filled with an administration solution and connect to a programmable micro-syringe pump.\nConnect above needle to the cannula that had been inserted into the esophagus at 3.2.5 (Figure 2C).\nAdminister a total volume of 25 μL [14C]-inulin solution at a constant rate (5 μL/min) (Figure 2C and 2D).\n4. Quantitative Experiment Using Radio-Labeled Water-Soluble Macromolecules ([14C]-inulin)\nDecapitate the experimental mice under anesthesia and open up their craniums, using scissors and from the side of the medulla oblongata, while taking care not to damage the brains.\nExtract carefully the whole brain by scooping using a micro-spatula from cranium.",
    "Place a filter paper moistened with saline solution on a Petri dish that is stored on ice.\nPlace the extracted brains on the moistened filter paper.\nWipe off blood adhering to the surface of the brain with a cotton swab moistened with saline solution to eliminate at least the influence of [14C]-inulin in the blood on the surface of the brain.\nDissect brains rapidly, and divide them into three parts: the olfactory bulb, cerebrum, and medulla oblongata (including the pons).\nPlace brain samples in tissue solubilizer at 50 °C for 1 h.\nAdd 10 μL of the liquid scintillation cocktail to the brain samples.\nTransfer a 25 μL aliquot of the administration solution dissolved in scintillation cocktail to a scintillation vial to determine the radioactivity of the applied solution.\nMeasure the disintegrations per minute of [14C] radioactivity in the brain sample ([14C] Xbrain) and the applied solution ([14C] XIN dose) in a liquid scintillation counter equipped with an appropriate crossover correction for 3H and 14C.\n5. Data Analysis\nCalculate the drug distribution levels (%) for the injected dose (ID%) using the following equation:\n\tID%⁄g brain = ([14C] Xbrain/[14C] XIN dose) × 100,\n\twhere Xbrain (dpm/g brain) is the amount of [14C]-inulin measured in the brain tissue and XIN dose (dpm/25 μL solution) is the concentration of the [14C]-inulin in the solution used for intranasal administration.\nSubscription Required.
