    "The use of human cells derived from biopsies as described below was approved by Moffitt’s Institutional Review Board and conducted under the clinical trial MCC# 14745 conducted at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute.\n1. Sorting of MM Cells from Bone Marrow Aspirates\nCollect bone marrow aspirates (20 ml) from patients in sodium heparin syringe.\nIsolate mononuclear cells by centrifuging diluted marrow (1:1 with sterile PBS) over a sterile aqueous medium centrifugation gradient at 400 x g for 30 min at ambient temperature.\nCollect the interface, which contains the mononuclear cells. Wash cells with cold PBS and count using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter, using trypan blue for determination of viability.\nPrepare a thin-layer cell preparation slide10 and stain with Wright-Giemsa stain to assess plasma cell percentage11.\nCalculate the amount of CD138 beads to be used based the number of cells and plasma cell percentage. If starting sample is less than 20% plasma cells, then re-suspend cells using 90 µl of separation buffer and 10 µl of CD138 beads per 5 x 106 cells. If starting sample is more than 20% plasma cells, resuspended using 80 µl of separation buffer and 20 µl of CD138 beads per 1 x 107 cells.\nIncubate cells with beads at 4 °C for 15 min.\nPass cells through a 35 µm strainer added to pre-wetted separation (LS) columns placed in the magnetic field separator (see list of materials).\nRemove column from magnet. Collect CD138-selected cells by washing the column 3 times with 1 ml of separation buffer.\nAssess CD138 enrichment with another stained thin-layer cell preparation slide10.\nFilter plasma obtained from bone marrow biopsy from each patient with a 0.22 µm syringe filter. Use fresh plasma from the same patient as the CD138+ cells.",
    "Prepare media for experiment by supplementing RPMI-1640 with 10% heat Inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% patient plasma and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.\nCollect the flow-through of the selection (CD138-) and follow the classical adhesion method12 to select for bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BMSCs). Since this process requires weeks before BMSCs are ready to be used, it is necessary to have BMSCs ready from previous patients or healthy donors.\n2. Seeding Cells in Plates (Using a Manual Multi-channel Pipettor)\nUse a multi-well plate (384 or 1,536) with black walls and a transparent flat bottom, preferentially one optimized for optical applications and cell culture.\nCo-culture BMSCs with MM cells in either collagen type I or basement membrane matrix, however, HUVECs require basement membrane matrix.\nKeep the final densities of each cell type in the following range: 3 x 105 cells/ml for MM cell lines, 2 x 105 cells/ml for HUVECs or BMSCs, and 2 x 106 cells/ml for patient-derived MM cells.\n\tNote: These densities are the result of experimental optimization to allow for the highest possible image quality and longest possible imaging time while maintaining biological relevance in the assays. MM cell lines are seeded at lower densities than primary MM cells due to their faster replication rate and larger size.\nCo-culture of primary MM cells with BMSCs:\n\t\nPrepare 100 µl aliquots of pre-mixed media consisting of 20 µl of 10x MEM, 20 µl of deionized H2O, 10 µl of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution, and 50 µl of 1x RPMI 1,640 and store at 4 °C.\nAt the time of seeding the plates with MM cells, mix aliquots of pre-mixed media with 150 µl of 3.1 mg/ml Bovine collagen type I to a final volume of 250 µl.\nRe-suspend 50 µl of cells in RPMI 1,640 at six times the final desired density.",
    "Mix to cell suspension with collagen mix to create a final volume of 300 µl using a P200 pipette.\nUsing a manual or repeater pipette, deposit a 8 µl drop of final cell/matrix mix in the center of each well in 384-well plates, or 2 µl in each well of 1,536 well plates (See step 2.6 for an example of spatial arrangement of wells).\nCentrifuge plate for 2 min at 500 x g to concentrate all cells to the same focal plane during imaging.\nLeave plate in an incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) for 1 hr, for gel polymerization.\nAdd 80 µl of supplemented growth media (RPMI-1640, 10% FBS HI, 10% patient-derived plasma, 1% P/S) to each well in 384-well plates, or 8 µl in 1,536-well plates.\nLeave plate O/N in incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) for adhesion of stroma to the bottom of the plate.\nCo-culture of primary MM cells with HUVECs:\n\t\nTransfer basement membrane matrix from -80 °C to a bucket with ice to thaw.\nCount and re-suspend primary cells and HUVECs in RPMI-1640 media at 4 times the final density, each in a separate tube.\nMix patient cells and HUVECs volumes at a 1:1 proportion.\nOnce basement membrane matrix is thawed, but still not polymerized, mix 1:1 with cell mixture from previous step.\nSeed droplets with adequate volume of cell-matrix mix in the center of each well (8 µl for 384-well plates and 2 µl for 1,536-well plates, see step 2.6 for an example of spatial arrangement of wells).\nCentrifuge plate at 500 x g for 10 min.\nPlace plate in incubator (5% CO2, 37 oC) for 1 hr for matrix polymerization.",
    "Add growth media (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% patient plasma and 1% P/S) to each well (80 µl for 384-well plates, 8 µl for 1,536-well plates).\nLeave plate O/N in incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) for adhesion of HUVECs to the bottom of the plate.\nSeed a 384-well plate. Figure 3 depicts a typical spatial distribution of seeding.\n\t\nStarting on well B2, seed as many columns as drugs to be tested. In the example of Figure 3, use seven drugs.\nRepeat seeding as many times as concentrations to be used. In the example in Figure 3, use five concentrations.\nSeed four more wells for control conditions.\nRepeat steps 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 for the second replicate.\nRepeat steps 2.6.1 to 2.6.4 for every patient sample to be tested in the plate.\nSeed a MM cell line in two lines of wells, each with as many wells as drugs to be tested (in duplicate). Each of these wells will be treated with the highest concentration of each drug to ensure that the stock used had adequate potency (see Figure 3 for example).\nSeed two wells with a MM cell line to serve as control of the experimental conditions, such as proper functioning of the bench top incubator, growth media, etc.\n3. Seeding Cells in Plates (Using a Robotic Pipettor)",
    "Note: This series of steps seeds a 384-well plate using a robotic pipettor. The design of the plate is depicted in Supplemental Figure 1, where primary MM cells are tested against a panel of 31 different drugs at five different concentrations in two replicates, plus negative control. A cell line is also seeded as positive control for assessment of drug efficacy and tested against all 31 drugs at the highest concentration, in two replicates. The files provided are for a particular brand and model (see Materials table) but the algorithm can be adapted to any robotic pipettors.\nCo-culture of primary MM cells with BMSCs:\n\t\nPrepare a 15 ml tube consisting of 240 µl of 10x MEM, 240 µl of deionized H2O, 120 µl of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution, 600 µl of 1x RPMI 1,640 and 1.8 ml of 3.1 mg/ml Bovine collagen type I. Label tube as “pre-mix for CD138+”. Place on ice until use.\nPrepare a 1.5 ml tube consisting of 50 µl of 10x MEM, 50 µl of deionized H2O, 25 µl of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution, 125 µl of 1x RPMI 1,640 and 375 µl of 3.1 mg/ml Bovine collagen type I. Label tube as “pre-mix for Cell Line”. Place on ice until use.\nRe-suspend 300 µl of CD138+ cells in RPMI 1,640 at six times the final desired density. Re-suspend 300 µl of BMSC cells in RPMI 1640 at six times the final desired density. Mix both volumes together in a 1.5 ml tube and label “CD138+”. Place in incubator until use.",
    "Re-suspend 60 µl of cell line in RPMI 1640 at six times the final desired density. Re-suspend 60 µl of BMSC cells in RPMI 1640 at six times the final desired density. Mix both volumes together in a 1.5 ml tube and label “Cell Line”. Place in incubator until use.\nUsing the software provided with the robotic pipettor, load the first script file, “cell_seedingPt47.PGM”. Place a 200 µl pipette tip box, a microtiter plate, and a sterile 384 well plate in the stations A, B and E, respectively, of the robot.\nMix the contents of tubes “pre-mix for CD138+” and “CD138+”. Transfer 1.5 ml of its contents to the well #1 of the microtiter plate. Place the tube with remaining volume on ice. Start the program. The robot will seed the first 176 wells (11 left-most columns) of the 384-well plate and then pause. Transfer the remaining of the tube on ice to well #2 of microtiter plate. Resume the program. The robot will seed the remaining 144 wells of the 384-well plate and pause.\nMix the contents of tubes “pre-mix for Cell Line” and “Cell Line” and transfer contents to well #3 of microtiter plate. Resume program. The robot will seed the remaining 64 wells of the 384-well plate.\nPlace 384-well plate in centrifuge for 10 min at 500 x g and 4 °C. Transfer plate to incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) for 1 hr for collagen polymerization.",
    "Load the second script file, “media_layer.PGM”. Place 120 µl pipette tip box, a reagent reservoir with 31 ml of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% patient plasma and 1% P/S, and the 384-well plate with cells into stations A, B and E, respectively. Run the program. The robot will transfer 81 µl of media to each well. Once finished, transfer 384-well plate to incubator and allow stroma to adhere to substrate O/N.\n4. Drug Preparation and Drugging of Plates (Using a Manual Multi-channel Pipettor)\nPrepare a template similar to Figure 3 in order to facilitate the process of adding drug to wells and reduce chance of confusion.\nPrepare, in a 96-well plate, a serial dilution of each of the drugs to be tested in the plate, for instance, for five concentrations using a 3-fold dilution:\n\t\nAdd 120 µl of drug at 10x the desired concentration in the highest concentration well. For example, use 500 µM melphalan if the highest concentration the cells will be exposed in the plate will be 50 µM.\nAdd 80 µl of growth media (RPMI supplemented with 10%FBS, 10% patient-derived plasma and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S)) to the four subsequent wells.\nTransfer 40 µl from the first well to the second and mix, to a total volume of 120 µl at 1/3 of the first well’s drug concentration, or 167 µM.\nRepeat step 4.2.3 to the remaining wells (e.g., transfer 40 µl from second to third, mix, then transfer 40 µl from third to fourth, etc.).",
    "Transfer 8 µl from each drug containing well to the corresponding well in the cell plate. Each drug containing well should have enough volume for 10 wells in the cell plate. In the example of Figure 3, each drug concentration is added to 6 different wells, except for the highest concentration, which is added to 8 wells.\nAdd 8 µl of growth media (RPMI supplemented with 10%FBS, 10% patient-derived plasma and 1% P/S) to the control wells.\nPlace cells in microscope as soon as ready and turn on the bench top incubation.\n5. Drug Preparation and Drugging of Plates (Using a Robotic Pipettor)\nDownload script files for robotic pipettor from http://www.i-genics.com/Jove2014Silva/Precision XS files.zip\nLoad the script “media_layer_DRUGPLATE.PGM” in the robotic pipettor user interface. Place a 120 µl pipette tip box, reservoir with 21 ml of RPMI-1,640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% patient plasma and 1% P/S and an empty 384-well plate in stations A, B and E, respectively. Run the program, the robotic pipettor will add 30 µl of media to all wells in the 384-well plate.\nFollowing the template from Supplemental Figure 2 add 200 µl of drug at 20x maximum concentration to each well of a microtiter plate. This setup accommodates up to 31 drugs. To the control well (CTRL), add RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% patient plasma and 1% P/S.\nPlace a 120 µl pipette tip box, microtiter plate with drugs at 20X concentration, and 384-well with media (from step 5.1) in stations A, B and C, respectively. Load the program “drug_plate.PGM”. The robotic pipettor will create a serial dilution of 1:3, following the spatial distribution in Supplemental Figure 1.",
    "Place a 120 µl pipette tip box, the 384-well plate with drug dilution (from step 5.3) and the 384-well plate with cells (from step 3.1.9) into stations A, B and C, respectively. Load and run program “drug_add.PGM”. The robotic pipettor will transfer 8 µl of drug from each well in the drug plate to its counterpart in the cell plate. Once finished, transfer cell plate to the incubator of the digital microscope as soon as possible.\n6. Imaging of Cells in Plate\nNote: The procedure below applies to the Evos Auto FL microscope, but can be readily adapted to other motorized stage microscopes with bench top incubation or incubator-embedded microscopes.\nClean the interior of the bench top incubator with an ethanol-wet wipe and carefully remove the lid of the plate while placing the lid of the incubator.\nFollow the software steps to add the beacons. This is the term used to refer to landmarks for regions of interest, to be imaged successively during the experiment (see software user guide for details).\nUse a 5X or 10X magnification objective. Make sure that the focus is similar to Figure 2: MM cells appear as bright disks surrounded by a dark ring and BMSCs or HUVECs are barely visible. Some primary MM cells are very small and thus a fine-tuning might be required to find the optimum focus.\nAdjust the acquisition interval between 10-30 min and for duration of at least 96 hr. While longer intervals between acquisitions are acceptable, intervals of 45 min or more may significantly reduce the precision of measurement of viability.\nConfigure the software so that the images of each well are stored in separate files named Beacon-1, Beacon-2, etc. If the robotic pipettor was used, set the beacons in the order depicted in Supplemental Figure 3.",
    "Make sure that there is enough water in the incubator humidifier and gas, so that cells will be in optimum conditions.\nUpon completion of the experiment, copy the folders containing the images to the computer that will run the analysis.\n7. Quantification of Drug Sensitivity\nNote: The following instructions guide the use of the image analysis using a computer cluster, since the analysis of a multi-well plate in a personal computer is extremely time consuming.\nDownload ImageJ software from NIH’s website: http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/\nDownload script and plugins at http://www.i-genics.com/Jove2014Silva/\nFollow instructions in http://www.i-genics.com/Jove2014Silva/UserGuide.pdf to run digital image analysis software. The result should be a spreadsheet named Results.csv containing the viability measurements at regular intervals for each well in the plate for the duration of the experiment (i.e., 96 hr).\nIf using a manual multi-channel pipettor, perform the following steps.\n\t\nDownload the file http://www.i-genics.com/Jove2014Silva/ExperimentalDesign.txt and modify it to match the layout of the plate defined in step 3.1 (e.g., Figure 3).\nDownload the software http://www.i-genics.com/Jove2014Silva/Evos384.jar and run it using the files created in steps 5.3 and 5.4 as the input parameter. The result will be a folder name Report containing multiple spreadsheets, each grouping the results for a particular drug.\nCopy and paste contents in spreadsheet template http://www.i-genics.com/Jove2014Silva/GraphPadAnalysisPT.pzfx\n\t\tNote: The result should be graphs such as the one depicted in Figure 4, representing the chemosensitivity of the sample to different drugs as a function of drug concentration and exposure time.\nIf using a robotic pipettor, perform the following steps.\n\t\nDownload template files from Download script files for robotic pipettor from http://www.i-genics.com/Jove2014Silva/Robotic Template Files.zip and extract files in a directory.\nModify the file DrugList.csv according to the list of drugs and highest drug concentration in the plate with cells. Follow the layout of Supplemental Figure 2.",
    "Run the program BuildExperimentalDesign.java passing as parameter the folder containing the files extracted in step 7.5.1 and the files Results.csv from step 7.3. The outcome should be two folders name MM1_S and PtSample. The first contains a description of the wells (drugs and concentrations) for the cell line positive control. The second contains the same information, but regarding the part of the plate seeded with patient cells.\nCopy the file Results.csv into each of the directories created in the step 7.5.3. Download the software http://www.i-genics.com/Jove2014Silva/Evos384.jar and run it using the files created in steps 7.5.3 for both folders. The result will be a folder name Report in each of the folders created in 7.5.3. The Report folder contains multiple spreadsheets, each grouping the results for a particular drug.\nRun the program BuildGraphPadFile.java and pass as parameter the folder containing the files extracted in step 7.5.1 and the files Results.csv from step 7.3. The result will be a graphpad file containing the dose response curves for each of the 31 drugs, and normalized by the control. Each chart will contain 5 drug concentrations for the primary MM cells and one concentration for the positive cell line control.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
