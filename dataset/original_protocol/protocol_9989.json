    "NOTE: Lithography of SU-8 molds for stencils (thickness = 250 μm) and microchannel parts (thickness = 150 μm), glass etching (depth = 100 μm), and cast fabrication were outsourced by sending designs using computer-aided design software to manufacturers.\n1. Fabrication of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stencil and microchannel\nDesign the micropattern of stencil and microchannel.\nFabricate or outsource SU-8 molds (thickness of ~250 μm for stencils and ~150 μm for microchannels) on silicon wafers (4\" diameter).\nPrepare PDMS mixture by mixing the base elastomer and curing agent at a ratio of 10:1.\n\t\nPlace 15 mL of the base elastomer in a 50 mL conical tube and add 1.5 mL of curing agent. Prepare two of these.\nVortex the PDMS mixture for 5 min. Centrifuge the PDMS mixture at 196 x g for 1 min to remove bubbles.\nTo fabricate PDMS stencil, pour ~1 mL of the PDMS mixture on the wafer, while avoiding SU-8 patterned regions so that the PDMS touches the side of the SU-8 pillars but not the top of the SU-8 pattern.\n\t\nPlace the wafer on a flat surface for over 30 min at room temperature (RT). Cure the PDMS in a dry oven at 80 °C for over 2 h.\nCarefully peel off the PDMS from SU-8 mold and trim the thin PDMS membrane using a 14 mm hollow punch. Remove the dust on the surface of the PDMS pieces using sticky tape and autoclave the PDMS stencils.\nTo fabricate PDMS microchannel, pour ~30 mL of PDMS mixture over the SU-8 mold.\n\t\nDegas for 30 min in a vacuum chamber and cure the PDMS in a dry oven at 80 °C for over 2 h.",
    "Carefully peel off the PDMS from SU-8 mold and cut the PDMS to a size of 24 mm x 24 mm. In each PDMS block, create one outlet and three inlets using a 1 mm biopsy punch.\n2. Preparation of bottom glass with polyacrylamide (PA) gel\nManufacture or outsource rectangular slide glasses (24 mm x 24 mm x 1 mm) with a rectangular micro-well (6 mm x 12 mm, 100 μm depth29) by cutting and etching glasses.\nSilanize the surface of a bottom glass30.\n\t\nPrepare a bind silane solution by mixing 200 mL of deionized water (DIW), 80 μL of acetic acid, and 50 µL of 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate (TMSPMA) for 1 h.\n\t\tCAUTION: TMSPMA is a combustible liquid. Follow the recommendations in material safety data sheets. Use only in a chemical fume hood.\nRemove the dust from the surface of the glass by sticky tape and autoclave the glass.\nCover the etched surface of the bottom glass with 100 μL of the bind silane solution and leave the glass at RT for 1 h.\nRinse the glass with DIW 3x and let the glass dry at ambient air temperature or by blowing air.\nPrepare a gel solution for the PA gel31.\n\t\nPrepare a fresh solution of 0.5 % (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS) by dissolving 5 mg of APS in 1 mL of DIW.\nPrepare the PA gel solution consisting of 138 µL of 40% acrylamide solution, 101 µL of 2% bis-acrylamide solution, 5 µL of fluorescent particle solution (0.2 μm), and 655 µL of DIW.\n\t\tCAUTION: Acrylamide and bisacrylamide solutions are toxic. Wear protective gloves, clothing, and eye protection. Protect the PA gel solution containing fluorescent particles from light.\n\t\tNOTE: Vortex the fluorescent bead solution before pipetting to obtain a uniform number of fluorescent beads per batch.",
    "After adding 100 μL of the APS solution and 1 μL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), transfer 10 µL of mixed gel solution onto the rectangular micro-well, and place on top a circular coverslip (18 mm).\n\t\tNOTE: To fill the bottom glass with PA gel without bubbles, place sufficient gel solution on the groove of the bottom glass, carefully slide the coverslip over the gel solution and remove any excess gel solution.\n\t\tCAUTION: The gel is slowly cured for about 40 min. The following procedure for centrifuging gels should be carried out as soon as possible.\nFlip the assembly of custom glass, gel solution, and coverslip, then centrifuge for 10 min at 96 x g to bring fluorescent particles to the top layer of PA gel.\nRemove the assembly from the centrifuge and place it on the flat surface with the coverslip facing down.\n\t\tNOTE: Beginning with step 2.3.6, handle samples in a biosafety cabinet.\nAfter 30 min, flip the assembly and place it in a 35 mm Petri dish, fill with 2 mL of DIW, and (using forceps) gently remove the coverslip by sliding it to one side.\n\t\tNOTE: Cured PA gel can be stored in DIW for 1 month. However, once collagen is coated on the PA gel, it should be used in an experiment within 1 day.\nCoat collagen on the PA gel.\n\t\nDissolve 1 mg/mL sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino) hexanoate (sulfo-SANPAH) in warm 50 mM HEPES buffer. Drop 200 µL of the solution onto the gel surface and activate by UV light (365 nm wavelength) for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Protect the sulfo-SANPAH from light.\nRinse the gel with 0.1 M [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; HEPES] buffer 2x and with PBS 1x.",
    "Coat the PA gel with collagen solution (100 μg/mL in PBS, rat tail collagen type I) at 4 °C overnight. On the following day, wash with PBS 3x.\n3. Micropatterning of cell islands\nPrepare F-127 (Table of Materials) solution [2% (w/v) in PBS] and immerse the autoclaved PDMS stencil in the F-127 solution. Keep it in a 37 °C incubator for 1 h.\nPrepare cell solution (2 x 106 cell/mL) in cell culture media consisting of: Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (AA).\nWash the PDMS stencil with PBS 3x and remove liquid from both the PDMS stencil and PA gel. Place the PDMS stencil on the PA gel and add PBS to the stencil.\nRemove bubbles in the holes of PDMS stencil by pipetting gently. After removing bubbles, remove PBS from the surface of the PDMS stencil.\nAfter putting 200 µL of cell solution on PDMS stencil, keep the PA gel in an incubator for 1 h so that cells attach to the PA gel.\nGently wash off cell solution with cell culture media, remove the PDMS stencil, and add more cell culture media. Check the formation of cell islands under a microscope.\n4. Assembly of PA gel with PDMS microchannel\nRemove dust on the PDMS microchannel using sticky tape, then autoclave.\nTreat the surface of the PDMS microchannel with oxygen plasma (80 W, 50 kHz) for 30 s.\nAfter removing any fluid on the PA gel-filled bottom glass, place the PDMS microchannel on top of the bottom glass and put the assembly on the custom glass holder.\nFill the microchannel with cell culture medium.",
    "CAUTION: Make sure to remove all the bubbles trapped in the channels by gently flushing warm media with a pipette. Also, while removing bubbles, make sure not to detach micropatterned cell islands.\n5. Integrated microfluidic system\nConnect the tubings.\n\t\nPrepare connectors by trimming the tip of needles (18 G) and bending it 90°.\nPrepare tubing lines for three inlets and one outlet.\n\t\t\nFor inlet tubing, connect the trimmed needle and a 30 cm mini-volume line with a three-way stopcock. Prepare three of these.\nFor outlet tubing, connect the trimmed needle and a 75 cm mini-volume line with a three-way stopcock. Prepare one of these.\nFill the tubing lines with the medium that has been preheated for 1 h.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: Make sure to remove all the bubbles trapped in the tubing lines by gently flushing warm media with a syringe.\nPrepare reservoirs by removing plungers from syringes and connecting inlet tubing lines.\nPlug the needle connectors of each tubing line into the three inlets and one outlet of the microfluidic device.\nFill the reservoirs with 3 mL of fresh medium or conditioned medium each.\n\t\nFor the gradient test, fill the left inlet reservoir with 20 ng/mL HGF in the cell culture medium.\nFor the visualization of concentration gradient, add a 200 µg/mL fluorescent dye (rhodamine B-dextran, 70 kDa) to the left inlet reservoir.\nConnect the outlet tubing line to a syringe pump.\n\t\tNOTE: The operating mode of the syringe pump is \"withdrawal\". Flow rate is changed according to the capacity of the syringe and operating speed of the syringe pump.\nPlace the integrated microfluidic system on the stage of a conventional epifluorescent microscope.",
    "CAUTION: To generate a gentle gradient of HGF in the microfluidic channel, the flow rate should be as slow as 0.1 µL/min. This is sufficiently sensitive so that it requires stabilization for 2 h, and care must be taken to avoid physical disturbance during the experiment.\n6. Image acquisition\nTake images every 10 min for up to 24 h using an automated microscope housed in an incubator. At each timepoint, take a set of images using a 4x objective lens in three different channels, including phase image to visualize cell migration, green fluorescent image to visualize fluorescent beads embedded in PA gel, and red fluorescent image to visualize the concentration gradient of a chemical.  \nAfter taking time-lapse images, infuse 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution into microchannels to detach cells from the PA gel. After completely removing cells from the gel, take a green fluorescent image to be used as a reference image for traction microscopy.\n7. Data analysis\nNOTE: A custom code for data analysis was developed using MATLAB, and details have been described elsewhere32,33,34,35,36.\nFor phase-image analysis, calculate displacements in two consecutive phase images using particle image velocimetry36.\nFor Fourier transform traction microscopy, compare each green fluorescent image with the reference image and calculate the displacements in each image using particle image velocimetry36. From the displacements, recover traction made by cells on PA gel using Fourier transform traction microscopy33,34,37.\nFrom the traction data, calculate stress within the monolayer of the cell island using monolayer stress microscopy based on finite element methods32,34,38.\nSubscription Required.
