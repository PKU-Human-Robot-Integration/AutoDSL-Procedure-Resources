  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were performed in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC 2011), as approved by the Ohio State University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Step 1 Animal Preparation and Surgical Protocol A canine model of basilar artery occlusion (BAO) stroke was used as previously described9,10.\nFast adult beagles (8-13 kg, 14-21 months old) overnight with free access to water.\nInject,  pre-anesthetic, an intramuscular administration of acepromazine (0.2 mg/kg) \nIntroduce a 20 gauge catheter into a cephalic vein. \nInduce anesthesia with intravenous administration of ketamine (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.025 mg/kg). \nFollowing anesthetic induction, intubate dogs and mechanically ventilate using constant inhaled anesthesia (2-3% isoflurane). \nCreate a 1 cm2 craniotomy window for laser speckle imaging. \nIntroduce a 7F arterial sheath into the right femoral artery for access and blood pressure measurement.  \nIntroduce a 16 gauge angiocatheter into the right femoral vein for blood draws.\nPrepare thromboembolus (blood clot) as previously described16. Briefly, draw and mix 5 mL of canine whole blood with 0.5 g of barium sulfate (Ba2SO4) in a plastic serum blood collection tube while rolling for 30 seconds. Rest the mixture undisturbed for 60 minutes at room temperature before catheter administration.\nBegin recording baseline digital subtraction angiography (DSA) prior to accessing the middle basilar artery. Advance a 4F guiding catheter under fluoroscopic guidance, using a retrograde trans-aortic approach, into the 7F arterial sheath previously placed into the right femoral artery through a vertebral artery to the base of the basilar artery. Inject two milliliters of contrast agent with normal saline to identify the basilar artery.",
    "Using a surgical scalpel, resect the clot into small pieces with both fibrin-rich and erythrocyte-rich layers16 to load into a 3 mL syringe and inject through the microcatheter into the middle of basilar artery. Allow the clot to stabilize for 10 minutes. Perform a follow up angiogram to verify your desired clot location. Arterial occlusion can be verified by DSA and decreasing cerebral perfusion by laser speckle imaging (LSI).\n2. Step 2 Laser Speckle Imaging \nFocus the laser speckle perfusion imaging (LSI) camera on the cranial window. Configure the high resolution laser speckle imaging (LSI) camera system as previously described15.  \nRecord perfusion with interruptions during performance of angiogram at desired time points. Acquire data from a 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm field of view using a 785 nm wavelength and 80 mW lasers with a sampling rate of 60 Hz at a working distance of 10 cm in this canine model.\nFrom the real-time perfusion graphs, choose the time-of-interest (TOI) to include lower peaks only to exclude the respiratory motion related artifacts. Average relative perfusion units over a 10 s sampling period using PimSoft v1.4 software. Perform laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) as previously described15.",
    "To optimize the quantification of brain microvasculature in this canine model, record images at 15 frames per second and perform intensity and variance calculations with spatiotemporal averaging over a 5 x 5 pixel area with 5 frames. The overall frame rate for the intensity and variance data was 3 frames per second. Choose the median value of perfusion for each pixel to reduce the effects on the mean of large sudden changes in perfusion readings due to motion from canine respiration. Convert raw data into binary files and process the data into meaningful imaging of the vasculature. Utilize the program re-tooled LASCA algorithm (rt-LASCA) to use the variance of the contrast data over time to determine the locations of vasculature as previously described15.   \n3. Step 3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Angiography\nPerform MRI the day before surgery for comparison if desired, then repeat to confirm BAO and again before sacrifice if a therapeutic is to be evaluated.\nPlace continuously anesthetized canines head-first in a supine position as previously described  in a Siemens Prisma 3 Tesla field strength and 60 cm-diameter bore MRI scanner including a 32 channel head coil as a receiver with enhanced parallel imaging performance to obtain brain images17.  \nPerform localizer scans to acquire pilot images of each canine brain before the anatomical imaging begins.  The system utilized to obtain the presented data has an integrated imaging system which allows faster scanning in optimal spatial and temporal resolutions. The 80 mT/m gradients generate high-quality T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted images and MR angiograms. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is sensitive enough and can show more anatomic sub-structure than by conventional structural MRI methods such as T2-weighted images. In this study, MRI was performed 4h after BAO.",
    "After proper localization, perform T2-weighted gradient echo imaging (Parameters: FOV = 130 mm, Matrix size = 320 x 320, pixel size = 0.3 x 0.3 mm, Slice thickness =3 mm, TR= 4s, FA= 180 degrees, BW =255 Hz/pixel, NEX= 2, TE=75ms, Resolution= 2.4615 pixels per mm) followed by a flow attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging to visualize the structure of the brain anatomy.\nPerform magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to visualize the vascular anatomy and blood circulation measurement. Acquire MRA of the brain covering the head and neck with a time-of-flight-3D (TOF) sequence in transverse view (Parameters: FOV = 129x129 mm, Matrix size = 768 x 768, pixel size = 0.3 x 0.3 mm, slice thickness = 81.59 mm, TR= 25 ms, FA= 18 degrees, BW =185 Hz/pixel, NEX= 1, TE=4.22ms, Resolution = 5.91 pixels per mm). Perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) with 3D color-coded visualization to maximize the signal intensity in the blood vessels.  Post-process acquired DICOM images to visualize the blood vessels and to confirm that the basilar artery was occluded.\n4. Step 4 Diffusion weighted imaging and stroke volume calculation\nPerform diffusion weighted imaging sequence to detect acute ischemic strokes (Parameters: FOV = 149mm x149 mm, Matrix size = 132 x0x0x 100, pixel size = 0.30mm x 0.30 mm, slice thickness = 4 mm, TR = 4.6s, FA = 90 degrees, BW = 255 Hz/pixel, NEX= 1, TE = 86ms, Resolution= 0.93 pixels per mm). Transfer DICOM images for post-processing. \nGenerate apparent diffusion maps (ADC) from DWI images and calculate infarct volumes using OsiriX MD v.5.0 software. \nTrace both the brain hemispheres and infarct areas per slice and multiply by slice thickness to acquire infarct volumes. \nConvert the absolute whole volume to 100 units to calculate the percent stroke volume of each canine.",
    "5. Step 5 Hematoxylin and Eosin staining brain histology \nAt time of sacrifice in anesthetized canine, harvest the brain and cut two medial sections 4 mm thick with a sharp scalpel, one section will be used for TTC staining below.\nFix the 4 mm section in 10% formalin for a minimum of 7 days to allow infiltration throughout the entire section.\nEmbed the fixed brain section in paraffin following our protocol17. \nTrim and level each paraffin block (multiple blocks can be stored and processed at the same time). \nSection each paraffin block at 4μm and place cut tissue on a 2\" x 3\" inch slide.\nProcess each slide in Hematoxylin 560 for 8 min, differentiate with 1% acid alcohol for 1s three times with rinsing in tap water. \nBlue each slide with 1% ammonium hydroxide for 1s and rinse for 2s with tap water.\nDehydrate in 70% ethanol for 1s twelve times, counterstained in eosin for 1 min.\nDehydrate in 95% for 1s twelve times followed by 100% ethanol. \nClear in xylene and apply a 2\" x 3\" inch coverslip with mounting media, removing air bubbles.\n6. Step 6 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride brain staining\nPlace the second 4 mm section which was harvested beside the H&E section into a previously prepared solution containing with 100 mL 2% 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in pH 7.4 PBS warmed to 37 °C in the dark.\nIncubate in the dark at 37 °C for at least 20 min, flipping the brain section over gently every 5 minutes. \nWhen the section turns cherry red on both sides, remove the TTC solution and replace with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, to optimize the contrast overnight.",
    "When the contrast is optimal between white and red staining in the brain (1-3 days), place between clear plastic sheets, dry excess fluid, and scan at high resolution.\nTrace the ischemic regions and whole brain slide to obtain percent infarction in each section as previously described17. \nSubscription Required.
