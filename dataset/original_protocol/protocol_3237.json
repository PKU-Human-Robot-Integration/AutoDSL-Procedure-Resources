Following the protocol, we typically obtain approximately 2,000 Pomc-Cre+ nuclei per animal. We also use nuclei isolated from two wild-type and one additional Pomc-Cre;CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice as blank or single-color controls during the FACS step.\nPerform cervical dislocation on deeply anesthetized (using 5% isoflurane) mice.\nQuickly dissect the hypothalamus and place it under a fluorescence stereomicroscope.\nNote: For a comprehensive guide on the dissection of the mouse hypothalamus, please refer to this video (jove.com/video/65674[href=http://jove.com/video/65674]).5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nUnder the GFP channel, isolate the tissue containing the GFP+ Pomc-Cre neurons from individual Pomc-Cre;CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice and promptly transfer it onto dry ice.\nCollect the tissue from a similar region in wild-type mice without GFP fluorescence and promptly transfer it onto dry ice.\nPause point: Store the brain tissues in a −80°C freezer.\nIsolating nuclei from dissected hypothalamic tissues\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nPrepare 50 mL of Sucrose Cushion buffer in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nAdd 8 mL of Sucrose Cushion buffer to individual 50 mL Nalgene centrifuge tubes.\nNote: Keep the tubes on ice throughout the experiment.\nPrepare 50 mL of Homogenization buffer in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nNote: Keep the tube on ice throughout the experiment.\nAdd 1 mL of Homogenization buffer into individual 2 mL Dounce tissue grinder tubes.\nNote: Keep the tubes on ice throughout the experiment.\nPower on the Sorvall RC6 Plus superspeed centrifuge and set the temperature to 4°C.\nPlace the dissected brain tissues into individual grinder tubes.\nNote: Tissues from 4–5 Pomc-Cre;CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice can be pooled into one grinder tube.\nDounce the brain tissues in individual grinder tubes 20 times using a Dounce grinder pestle.\nPlace a 30 μm pre-separation filter over a 15 mL Falcon tube.",
    "Soak the filter with 0.5 mL of Homogenization buffer.\nExtract approximately 1 mL of tissue homogenate from each grinder tube and filter it through the 30 μm filter into the 15 mL Falcon tube.\nRinse individual grinder tubes with 1.25 mL of Homogenization buffer. Collect the liquid with a pipette and filter it through the 30 μm filter into the 15 mL Falcon tube. Repeat once.\nGently and slowly transfer the filtered homogenate (∼4 mL) from the 15 mL Falcon tube into individual Nalgene centrifuge tubes containing the Sucrose Cushion buffer.\nBalance the tubes and centrifuge them at 47,000 g for 1 h at 4°C.\nAfter centrifugation:\nUse a pipette to carefully discard the top and middle layers of the liquid (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3006-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Nuclei isolation using sucrose gradient centrifugation\n(A) Representative images showing tissue homogenate before (left) and after (right) sucrose gradient centrifugation. The white layer in the middle indicates cellular debris.\n(B) It is helpful to label the expected location (red circle) of the nuclei pellet before centrifugation.\nChange the pipette tip and carefully discard the remaining liquid without disturbing the nuclei pellet.\nNote: Do not pour the liquid.\nPrepare 50 mL of Wash buffer in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nNote: Keep the tube on ice throughout the experiment.\nResuspend the nuclei with 100 μL of Wash buffer and transfer them into a new 15 mL Falcon tube.\nAntibody incubation (optional)\nTiming: 30 min",
    "Before conducting FACS, we incubate the nuclei isolated from Pomc-Cre;CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice with several antibodies to enhance sample enrichment, enable multiplexing, and support data analyses. For example, we have discovered that FACS by GFP alone is inadequate for excluding nuclei from other cell types. This could be due to potential leakage of the Pomc-Cre transgene in non-neuronal cells during early development, as noted in a recent study.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Therefore, we employ an anti-NeuN-Alexa Fluor 647 antibody to selectively label Pomc-Cre+ nuclei from neurons. We find that the dual color sorting approach, utilizing both Fluor 647 and GFP, improves the enrichment of neuronal nuclei while effectively reducing those from non-neuronal cells. Furthermore, we incorporate a multiplexing strategy7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] by utilizing barcoded antibodies against nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins, which are present on the surfaces of nuclei. This multiplexing enables us to analyze nuclei from different groups, such as batch or sex, and facilitates the identification and removal of doublets (samples with barcodes from two different anti-NPC antibodies) during quality control steps.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Additionally, we use a barcoded anti-GFP antibody to specifically label GFP+ Pomc-Cre nuclei. This allows us to track and analyze this particular group during data analyses.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nAdd 1 μL of anti-NeuN-Alexa Fluor 647 antibody, 0.5 μL of each barcoded anti-NPC antibody, and 1 μL of barcoded TotalSeq anti-GFP antibody to the nuclei isolated from Pomc-Cre;CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice.\nAdd 1 μL of anti-NeuN-Alexa Fluor 647 antibody to the nuclei isolated from one wild-type mouse, which will be used as a single-color (Alexa Fluor 647) control during FACS.\nNote: Untreated nuclei from the other wild-type mouse and one Pomc-Cre;CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mouse will serve as a blank and another single-color (GFP) control, respectively.\nNote: We recommend using extra-long pipette tips for this step.\nMix the nuclei and antibodies well and incubate the mixture on ice for 10 min.",
    "Wash the nuclei by adding 3 mL Wash buffer and precipitate them by centrifugation using a swinging bucket centrifuge at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the liquid using a pipette and repeat the washing step two more times.\nResuspend nuclei with 100 μL of Wash buffer, pool all the antibody-treated nuclei from Pomc-Cre;CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice, and filter them through a 30 μm filter into a BD sorting tube. Similarly, filter the nuclei designated for sorting controls and place them into separate sorting tubes.\nPurifying nuclei through dual-color FACS\nTiming: 1.5–2 h\nUse the nuclei for blank, single-color (Alexa Fluor 647 or GFP) controls to set the gating threshold.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3006-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gating threshold for dual-color sorting of Pomc-Cre neurons\nCellular debris can produce autofluorescence signals detectable across multiple fluorescent channels, such as tdTomato or DAPI. We added a negative gating step (green box) to identify and exclude debris from the collection process. Notably, the nuclei of Pomc-Cre neurons do not generate tdTomato fluorescence. Therefore, any fraction showing strong tdTomato signals (red oval) can be attributed to cellular debris, which we deliberately exclude from the final collection of dual-color NeuN+/GFP+ Pomc-Cre nuclei (orange box).\nNote: Cellular debris generates autofluorescence and therefore can be mistakenly collected as nuclei during FACS. Although dyes such as DAPI are commonly used to differentiate nuclei from debris, they can intercalate with the DNA and disrupt chromatin structure, leading to lower data quality.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] To minimize contamination, we use a negative gating strategy to identify and exclude them. Please see more details in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nSort the dual-color nuclei (Alexa Fluor 647 and GFP) into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 100 μL of Wash buffer.\nRetrieving and enriching nuclei using ConA-beads\nTiming: 30 min\nThoroughly mix the ConA-beads solution (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3006-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Retrieval and enrichment of FACS-sorted nuclei using ConA-beads\nAdd 11 μL of ConA-beads to a new 0.2 mL PCR tube and place it on ice.\nActivate the ConA-beads by adding 100 μL of ConA-beads Activation buffer. Mix the solution using a pipette.\nIncubate the solution on ice for 15 min.\nPlace the PCR tube on a magnet rack (in front of a magnet, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Wait for 1–2 min until the slurry clears and then remove the liquid using a pipette.\nRepeat steps 26–28 one more time.\nResuspend the activated beads with 11 μL of Wash buffer and place the tube on ice.\nExtract 10 μL of the activated beads and add them into the Eppendorf tube with the sorted nuclei.\nIncubate on ice for 10 min.\nPlace the tube on a magnet rack (in front of a magnet) for 1–2 min until the slurry clears and then remove the liquid with a pipette.\nNote: Do not let the nuclei/beads dry out.\nResuspend the nuclei/beads with 6 μL of Wash buffer. Gently mix well on ice.\nUse 1 μL of the nuclei/beads mixture to determine the concentration of the nuclei.\nNote: Add DAPI or use GFP signals for counting nuclei.\nAdjust the concentration to 1,000–5,000 nuclei/μL.\nProceed with the 10× Single-nucleus Multiome pipeline using 5 μL of purified nuclei."
