There are alternative culture methods for hESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells available. Refer to the preferred protocol of choice.\nCoat a well of a 6 well dish with Geltrex solution (2 mL per well) and place in the incubator for 1 h.\nThaw a vial of hESCs, and transfer cell suspension from cryovial to 2 mL of prewarmed Essential 8 medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (E8/ROCKi).\nThe cells are pelleted (300 × g for 4 min), the supernatant is removed, and the pellet is resuspended again in 2 mL E8/ROCKi medium.\nRemove Geltrex solution and plate cells using a 10 or 5 mL pipette.\nChange culture medium (E8) daily.\nPassage the cells 1:3 when they reach 70%–90% confluency.\nTo passage cells, aspirate media, wash briefly with 2 mL of PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and remove the PBS wash.\nAdd 1 mL of room temperature 0.5 mM EDTA solution (stored at room temperature) to the well and incubate at room temperature for 3–5 min, or until cells begin to uniformly detach.\nCollect cell suspension using a 10 or 5 mL pipette in a 15 mL tube, pellet cells at 300 × g for 4 min, remove supernatant and resuspend in 6 mL of E8 medium.\nPlate cells in 3 wells (6 well culture dish) precoated with Geltrex.\nIncubate cells at 37°C/ 5% CO2.\nCritical: Cell viability must be higher than 85% at passaging.\nStage I: Neural induction\nTiming: 7 days",
    "Day 0 is the protocol initiation day, and Day 1 is the neural induction initiation day. Times of media changes should be noted and reproduced as accurately as possible throughout the protocol. Radial patterning is visible in the cell monolayer from day 3, and by day 6 neural rosettes should be clearly visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Day 7 marks the end of the neuronal induction part of the protocol and cells are passaged to the self-patterning Stage II.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1984-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A series of representative brightfield images demonstrating the characteristic formation of rosettes during stage I neural induction\n(A) The protocol starts with the addition of Accutase to the hESC cells in culture (A), and cell counts and seeding for Stage I initiation. (A) Characteristic morphology of the hESCs with the small cytoplasm growing in E8 medium showing no signs of spontaneous differentiation.\n(B) Day 0, showing the cells 1 h after plating.\n(C) Representative image of the culture at Day 1, demonstrating the grid-like formation typical after ROCKi supplementation at Day 1.\n(D and E) Proliferation and confluency are enhanced at Day 2 and already at Day 3 the initiation of the columnar arrangement of rosettes can be observed (E).\n(F–H) The formation and maturation of rosettes and their compaction to neural tube-like structures is the characteristic feature of this part of the protocol.\nAlthough some less populated areas may be observed, (as shown at the Day 5 image, (G), other than few areas at the borders of the culture wells, the cells are highly confluent without viability issues (as assessed by the cell counts).\n(I) Rosettes at this stage may be looser (H) or reach high compaction (I).",
    "(J) At day 7 the cells are collected to be transitioned to Stage II. Images were taken with an EVOS FL microscope at 20× magnification and scale bar corresponds to 100 μm.\nPause point.\n(K and L) Cells can be collected and frozen at this point (Day 7). The black-framed panel shows the cells 1 h after passaging (K), if the protocol continues uninterrupted or if cells are frozen and reseeded at a later stage (L). Images were taken with an EVOS FL microscope at 20× magnification and scale bar corresponds to 100 μm.\nPreparation of culture dishes and culture media\nRefer to materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]-section for reagents and NIM medium composition instructions.\nEnsure that culture dishes are properly coated with Geltrex (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). Add 0.5 mL Geltrex solution per well for 12-well culture dishes and place in the incubator for 1 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1984_6.csv\nStep-by-step stage I instructions\nDay 0.\nStarting with 80%–90% confluent, undifferentiated hESCs, aspirate medium, wash cells twice with 1× PBS to remove medium.\nAspirate PBS wash each time, before adding 1 mL prewarmed Accutase per well. The optimal Accutase incubation time needed, to collect a cell suspension consisting of clumps of 1–10 cells for hESC lines HS360 and H9 and without vigorous pipetting, was empirically evaluated to be 7 min.\nPlace culture dish containing Accutase in the incubator at 37°C for 7 min.\nNote: Protocol efficiency relies on the suspension having a high cell viability at seeding (ideally above 85%, as determined by the report of the Countess II). As hESCs are sensitive to vigorous pipetting, the incubation time in Accutase can be extended by 2 min (to a total of 9 min) instead of using mechanical force to attain an easy to collect single-cell suspension.",
    "Collect the cell suspension using a 5 mL pipette, as it has a large diameter similar to the size of hESCs and is optimal for passaging and viability.\nTransfer the single-cell suspension to a 15 mL tube containing 4 mL Essential 8 medium containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (E8/ROCKi) and set aside 20 μL of the suspension for cell counting.\nPellet cells (300 × g for 4 min), remove the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 mL E8/ROCKi medium. (See notes on use of ROCKi at troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nWhile the cells are being centrifuged, count the cells and assess the viability using trypan blue in an automated cell counter, such as the Countess II. The cell count can also be performed using a standard haemocytometer.\nRemove Geltrex solution from prewarmed Geltrex-coated culture dishes.\nImmediately plate cells at 17K cells/cm2 on Geltrex-coated culture dishes. The preferred format is 12-well culture dishes. Follow even cell spreading instructions (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nIncubate cells at 37°C/5% CO2.\nDay 1.\nOn Day 1, replace 1 mL E8/ROCKi cell culture medium with the neural induction medium (NIM) containing the LSX inhibitors to initiate the neuronal differentiation induction of hESCS and generate cells of anterior neuroectodermal fate.\nNote: For culture work form Day 1–6, change NIM medium supplemented with LSX inhibitors (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]-section) daily.\nNote: Add LSX inhibitors to the prewarmed (37°C) NIM fresh before replacing culture medium.\nNote: Day 7 is the last day of Stage I.\nPause point: Cells can be collected and frozen at Day 7.\nNotes about choice of components for neural induction",
    "Neuronal induction from human pluripotent stem cells can be directed to generate cells of anterior neuroectodermal fate using three small molecules LDN, SB and XAV, that antagonize the BMP, TGF-ß and WNT signaling pathways at standardized (100 nM LDN, 10 μM SB, 2 μM XAV) (Ohashi et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Cakir et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) or similar concentrations of these small molecules (Tchieu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Major et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). The serum-free, chemically defined N2 supplement, is used from Day 1 and throughout the differentiation protocol. N2 is essential for cell commitment and differentiation, but also for survival and expression of post-mitotic neurons in culture. It favors the expression of neural-specific genes (such as neural specific filaments, for example TUBB3 and NFH) and inhibits the growth of non-neuronal cells (or undifferentiated residual ES cells) in culture.\nBrief description of the outcomes of stage I\nWe include a series of brightfield images to demonstrate how the cells, starting from the confluent hESC cultures at Day 0, differentiate towards neuroectoderm. Representative images are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. A full timeline of representative images (at 20× magnification) of all staged of the protocol are also available (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Cells at Day 7 can be collected and frozen (in NIM containing 10% DMSO), to be thawed and reseeded at a later stage.\nCritical: Cell viability must be higher than 85% at passaging.",
    "Critical: At this stage, differentiating cells are sensitive to disturbance but rapidly reach confluence. Thus, at daily cell culture medium changes, care should be taken not to disrupt the monolayer. To remove media, the culture dish is lifted from the back at an angle that lets the medium well-up at the front, and the pipettor is placed vertically, to permit medium removal without contact and without disturbing the cells. 90% of the medium is removed, so that the cells do not dry out while replacing media. To replace media, the front edge of the culture dish sits on the hood floor, tilted forward, and medium is changed placing the pipette tip at an angle, by the side at the wall of each well, adding the culture medium dropwise and slowly, protecting the monolayer from mechanical disruption.\nStage II: Neuronal self-patterning\nTiming: 6 days\nAfter the Stage I fate induction, this second stage of the differentiation protocol is a growth factor-free, self-patterning stage where the neural precursor monolayer is maintained in N2/B27 supplemented medium. The cells remain adherent while survival and maturation are enhanced. Given that the differentiating cells are split and replated twice in 20 days, and seeded at high confluency from day 7 onwards, B-27 supplement is added at Stage II to aid neuronal outgrowth and long-term neuronal survival.\nPreparation of culture dishes and culture media\nTiming: 3.5 h\nRefer to materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]-section for reagent, coating and Neuronal Self Patterning Medium (NSPM) medium composition instructions.\nCoating Instructions for cell culture plates used in Stage II.",
    "Prepare the POF mix diluting a stock polyornithine aliquot 1:500 in ddH2O (for a final concentration of 20 μg/mL) and add to that a fibronectin stock aliquot (for a final concentration of 1 μg/mL). To make a 50 mL POF solution, add 50 μL of the fibronectin stock solution.\nAdd 0.5 mL of the POF mix to each well of a 12 well dish and incubate the plate at 37°C for 2 h.\nWash each well carefully with 1 mL of 1× PBS and aspirate PBS wash.\nAdd 0.5 mL of Geltrex solution and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nNote: In our hands, the combination of Geltrex over the POF coating, gave the highest viability in order to eliminate passaging steps at this seeding density.\nPlates are ready to be used. Alternatively, they can be stored at 4°C for up to two weeks.\nPrepare Stage II NSP medium. See manufacturer’s instructions for N2 and B27 supplements. If N2 and B27 are aliquoted, and the penicillin/streptomycin solution thawed, the required time is 10 min.\nStep-by-step stage II instructions\nDay 7.\nEnsure that culture dishes are properly coated and prewarmed in the cell incubator.\nAspirate culture medium add 1 mL prewarmed Accutase to each well and place culture dish in the incubator for 7 min.\nNote: Protocol efficiency relies on high viability of the cell suspension at seeding (ideally above 90%). As proliferating cells at high confluency may be sensitive to vigorous pipetting, incubation time in Accutase can be extended by 2 min (to a total of 9 min) instead of using mechanical force to attain an easy to collect single-cell suspension.",
    "Collect cells in 15 mL tubes using a pipettor with 10 mL, 5 mL or 1 mL serological pipettes. At this stage, cells can also be collected with a single channel pipette using a 1 mL tip.\nTransfer single-cell suspension to 15 mL tubes containing NSP medium with 10 μM ROCKi and set aside 20 μL of the suspension for cell counting.\nPellet cells (300 × g for 4 min), remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in NSP/ROCKi medium.\nWhile cells are being centrifuged, count the cells and assess the viability using trypan blue in Countess II. The cell count can also be performed using a standard haemocytometer.\nRemove Geltrex solution from prewarmed POF-Geltrex (POFG)-coated culture dishes.\nImmediately plate cells at 130K cells/cm2 (we generally use 12-well dishes). Follow even cell-spreading instructions (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nIncubate cells at 37°C/5% CO2.\nNote: For culture work from Day 8 to Day 12, change NSPM daily.\nNote: ROCKi is only used at passaging cells at Day 7.\nBrief description of the rationale and outcomes of stage II",
    "Sensitivity to pharmacological treatments could be dramatically different depending on cell type, cell confluency and free space availability, or cell to cell contact inhibition. Unlike, functional studies of individual neurons that require low density for synapse formation and dendritic spine morphology analyses, neuronal induction protocols should employ a medium- to- high-density seeding approach at the cell-culture- split level, followed by higher density at replating, to permit optimal cell survival and maturation. Of note, hESCs, neuronal precursors and neurons are contact dependent cells, but contact inhibition is also a known factor affecting cell signaling cascades and gene expression patterns (Ribatti, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Gérard and Goldbeter, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). This makes the newly formed cell connections in a monolayer of differentiating cells fragile and susceptible to guidance cues. Thus, cell density at seeding and passaging should be taken under consideration to avoid repetitive mechanical disruption of cell connections due to multiple passaging steps. This is important both for the accurate morphological characterization of the chosen time points of analysis and for the future pharmacological studies (Biffi et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Ge et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nA set of representative phase contrast images at days 8, 11 and 13 showing how neural stem cells and neuronal precursors organize in the self-patterning stage are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] (while the full Stage II image timeline from Day 7–13 is available at Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1984-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(C) By day 13 the culture forms as a heterogeneous cell population composed of precursors and immature neurons. All images were taken before routine media changes. As described, daily culture medium replacement is not accompanied with washing steps, thus by day 13, dead cells and debris may be accumulating. Images were taken with an EVOS FL microscope at 20× magnification and scale bar corresponds to 100 μm.\nCritical: Cell viability must be higher than 85% at passaging.\nStage III: Neuronal maturation\nTiming: 7 days\nIn addition to the N2 supplement and the B27 supplement, the Stage III cell culture medium is supplemented with bFGF and EGF. B27 was empirically reduced by 50% compared to Stage II, as cells are preconditioned to the coating, and supplementation of culture medium with bFGF and EGF can promote growth of maturing neurons.\nPreparation of culture dishes and culture media\nTiming: 3.5 h\nRefer to materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]-section for reagent, coating and Neuronal Maturation Medium (NMM) composition instructions.\nCoating Instructions for cell culture plates used in Stage III are the same as in Stage II.\nPrepare the POF mix diluting a stock polyornithine aliquot 1:500 in ddH2O (for a final concentration of 20 μg/mL) and add to that a fibronectin stock aliquot (for a final concentration of 1 μg/mL).
