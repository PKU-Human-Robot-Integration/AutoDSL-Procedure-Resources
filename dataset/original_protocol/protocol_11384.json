    "1. Culturing Brain Tumor Stem Cells Previously Derived from Human Glioblastoma Specimens\nNote: BTSC cultures were previously established from human GBM patient samples6,7,8,9,10.\nThaw a vial of cryogenically preserved BTSCs in a beaker containing 70% ethanol, placed inside a water bath at 37 °C, just until the last of the ice has thawed. Dilute the thawed cells in 10 mL of media in a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge the cells at 150 relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 7 min.\n\tNote: Throughout these protocols, complete media refers to standard media used to culture BTSCs (previously described by Kelly et al.)6, typically with growth factors present. Media without growth factors refers to the base media with all components but without any growth factors supplemented.\nAspirate the media, resuspend the cells in 8 mL of complete media, and transfer the cells and media to a T25 flask.\nAfter 1 week of culturing under non-adherent conditions, monitor the flask daily and supplement the contents with 1 - 2 mL of complete media as needed, if the media begins to deplete or starts to become acidic as indicated by an orange-yellow color change. Passage cells when the neurospheres reach a diameter of approximately 250 μm, typically between 10 - 14 d (Figure 1).\n\tNote: The doubling time of different BTSC cultures varies widely. Neurosphere size can be measured using an ocular micrometer.\nTo passage BTSCs, collect the media and neurospheres by pipetting the media down the surface of the flask in order to collect all neurospheres and transfer them to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge the tube for 7 min at 150 RCF.",
    "Note: Flasks can be checked under a microscope to ensure that all neurospheres have been collected. An additional wash with 5 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or media can be performed to collect any remaining neurospheres as necessary.\nTo dissociate the BTSC neurospheres into single cells, aspirate the media and add 1 mL of pre-warmed cell detachment solution and incubate that at 37 °C for 7 min. Triturate the BTSC suspension 40x with a P1,000 micropipette set at 800 μL.\n\tNote: Cells can be incubated longer at 37 °C if the neurospheres do not dissociate.\nAdd 5 mL of PBS (with the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin) to the dissociated BTSCs and centrifuge the cells at 150 RCF for 7 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the BTSCs in 1 - 4 mL of complete media, depending on the size of the cell pellet.\n\tNote: The cell suspension needs to be further diluted if the concentration is beyond the accurate detection limit for accurate cell counting.\nUsing a dye that excludes dead cells, such as trypan blue, count the number of viable cells and seed the BTSCs into the flask or plate of interest—typically, 200,000 - 300,000 cells in 8 mL of complete media in a T25 flask.\n2. Brain Tumor Stem Cell Migration Assay\nSeed 200,000 cells in a T25 flask in 8 mL of complete media 1 - 2 weeks before planning to perform a migration assay.\n\tNote: The time between plating and performing the assay will vary depending on the growth rate of the BTSC culture used.",
    "To test the effect of a drug treatment on migration, pretreat the cells with the appropriate vehicle, such as DMSO, and drug of interest by adding applicable volumes of the vehicle or drug stock directly into separate wells of media containing the cells.\nPrepare the chemotaxis migration plate (Figure 2A) by coating it with a thin layer of collagen.\n\t\nCalculate the number of wells of a 96-well chemotaxis plate that will need to be coated with collagen. Include at least three replicate wells for each condition.\nDilute 5 mg/mL of stock of type I collagen to 0.2 mg/mL in pure acetic acid diluted to 0.14% in culture grade water.\nPipette 0.2 mg/mL of collagen to both the membrane insert wells and the bottom reservoir wells that are being used.\n\t\tNote: The bottom reservoirs of the plate require 225 µL and the membrane insert wells require 75 µL of collagen for a proper coating.\nPlace the migration plate in an incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. Aspirate the collagen solution from the wells without scratching the collagen coating.\nWash the wells 2x with sterile 1x PBS. If the plate is not being used right away, aspirate the PBS and store it at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. Prior to use, warm the chemotaxis migration plate to room temperature.\nPrepare the bottom reservoir of the chemotaxis migration plate.\n\t\nPipette 225 µL of media (without growth factors), supplemented with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant, to the bottom reservoir wells of the chemotaxis migration plate.\nGently place the membrane insert into the bottom reservoir at an angle to avoid creating bubbles.\nPlate the cells into the membrane insert of the chemotaxis migration plate.",
    "Resuspend dissociated BTSCs in media (without growth factors) at a cell density of 50,000 cells/mL. Add drugs to the media if assessing migration during different drug treatments. Alternately, seed equal numbers of pre-treated cells and control cells, while maintaining the final drug concentration when plating.\nPlate 50 µL of the BTSCs from step 2.4.1 into each well of the migration plate under the desired treatment conditions.\nImage the chemotaxis migration.\n\t\nPlace the chemotaxis migration plate into the live-cell imaging system and set the automated imaging software to acquire microscopic images of the plate every 1 - 2 h for up to 72 h. Using commercial software (see Table of Materials), right-click on the timeline and set the scan interval to every 2 h for 24 h.\n\t\tNote: The time interval and total elapsed time will vary between BTSC cultures used; start with 2 h intervals for 72 h until experience has been gained with individual BTSC cultures. If an automated imaging system is unavailable, then images of the same field of view can be acquired manually with a microscope and a camera connected to the imaging software.\nOnce the image acquisition is complete, obtain the images for the entire experiment and create a processing definition using the analysis software that differentiates cells from the background of the membrane and the migration pores (Figure 2B, red mask). Using commercial software (see Table of Materials), select a New Processing Definition and set the processing definition settings for BTSCs to a seed threshold of 52, a grow threshold of 85, adjustments of the size (pixels) by -1, and a minimum area of 200 μm2. Apply this processing definition to the bottom side of the membrane. Modify this analysis if it does not accurately distinguish cells from the background membrane.",
    "Collect data as the cell surface area on the bottom side of the membrane for each of the three replicate wells, which only counts the cells that have migrated through the pores. Graph the migration of the cells in μm2 (area of cells migrated) over time (Figure 2C, Figure 3).\n\t\tNote: Ensure that the relative number of cells plated and counted on the top surface of the membrane at the first time-point are similar (less than 20% variation across all wells) between all treatment conditions to avoid any effects of uneven plating. Data collection using the commercial software (see Table of Materials) can be executed by launching the processing definition created in step 2.5.2, clicking on Metrics, then on Graph/export, and then on Data export.\n3. Brain Tumor Stem Cell Neurosphere Invasion Assay\nSeed 200,000 cells in 8 mL of complete media in a T25 flask 1 - 2 weeks before planning to perform an invasion assay.\n\tNote: The timing from plating to performing the assay will depend on the proliferation rate of the BTSC culture used.\n\t\nFor pretreated cells, add the compound of interest to the flask at the desired concentration for the predetermined time course before the neurospheres are ready to be plated for invasion.\nWait until the average neurosphere size is approximately 150 - 200 μm; typically, this takes 7 - 14 d, depending on the BTSC culture being used.\n\tNote: It is typical to observe a distribution of sphere sizes in the flask.\nTip and gently mix the flask with a pipette and move 500 μL of the BTSC neurospheres to a 1.5 mL conical tube for each treatment condition; this will be used to plate three replicate wells.",
    "Note: Steps 3.3.1 - 3.3.2 are optional but recommended for the first invasion experiment on a new BTSC culture.\n\t\nTo determine the density of the neurospheres that will end up in the well, prepare a 1.5 mL tube as in step 3.3. Gently mix the neurospheres and move 100 μL into a separate 96-well plate and allow the neurospheres to settle by gravity for 5 min.\nCheck the number of neurospheres under the microscope to ensure multiple neurospheres are in the region of the well that will be imaged without overcrowding it.\n\t\tNote: Invading neurospheres require enough room to triple in diameter without interacting with neighboring neurospheres. The number of neurospheres per well can be adjusted by counting the number of neurospheres per well and adding more or fewer neurospheres from the T25 flask to the 1.5 mL conical tube in step 3.3.\nPlace the 1.5 mL conical tube with the cells from step 3.3 on ice and perform steps 3.5 - 3.7 on ice.\nLet the neurospheres settle by gravity to the bottom of the 1.5 mL conical tube for 5 min and prechill a labeled 96-well plate on ice.\nResuspend the neurospheres in the extracellular matrix protein.\n\t\nPrepare 500 μL of a 0.4 mg/mL type I collagen solution on ice for each treatment condition: add 459 μL of media (without growth factors), 40 μL of the 5 mg/mL collagen stock solution, and 0.92 μL of sterile 1N NaOH (Table 1).",
    "Note: 500 μL of the collagen solution is required per treatment condition: 100 μL for each of the three replicate wells and 200 μL of excess. Drug treatments need to be added here at the desired final concentration, subtracted from the media component of the solution. This protocol describes the use of type I collagen as the extracellular matrix protein; however, any extracellular matrix protein can be tested. In addition, for BTSC cultures that have slower rates of invasion, growth factors or FBS can be supplemented in the media to increase the rate of invasion.\nAfter the neurospheres from step 3.5 have settled, aspirate as much of the media as possible without losing the neurosphere pellet that has settled at the bottom. Gently resuspend the neurospheres in 500 μL of the collagen solution prepared in step 3.6.1.\nAdd 100 μL of the collagen and neurosphere mixture to three replicate wells of the 96-well plate on ice. Allow the neurospheres to settle on ice for 5 min.\nTransfer the 96-well plate to a 37 °C incubator for 5 min to allow for collagen polymerization.\nImmediately prepare to image the 96-well plate.\n\t\nPlace the 96-well plate into the tray of a live-cell imaging system or on the stage of a microscope to acquire an image as a reference for the neurosphere size at the time of plating, before the invasion begins.\nAcquire images every hour until the rate of invasion has plateaued; typically, this occurs within 24 h.\n\t\tNote: The imaging interval can be modified depending on the equipment being used. The imaging interval and total elapsed time can also be modified for BTSC cultures that have different rates of invasion.\nDetermine the increasing surface area of BTSCs as they invade the matrix over time.",
    "Note: The surface area of cells at the time of plating, calculated as the mean of three replicate wells, needs to be similar (less than 20% variation across all wells) between the different treatment conditions to ensure the differences in the BTSC invasion are not strongly affected by the number or size of the neurospheres plated.\n\t\nFor the live-cell analysis system, use a 10X objective for the image acquisition and acquire four images per well for the three replicate wells. To determine the relative cell surface area, represented as the percent confluence of the well, set up a processing definition that specifically highlights the cells over the background of the well. Using commercial software (see Table of Materials), select a New Processing Definition and set the segmentation adjustment to 0.8, the area minimum to 300 μm2, and the eccentricity maximum to 0.99. Modify this analysis if it does not accurately distinguish cells from the background.\n\t\tNote: If using other methods to image neurosphere invasion over time, it is recommended to obtain multiple fields of view for the three replicate wells over time. However, not imaging the exact same field of view at each interval will increase the standard error of the data collected. Computer software can be used to help measure the surface area of the invading cells in each image.\nCollect data as the total cell surface area (either relative or absolute) for every well at each time-point and determine the mean of the three replicate wells. Graph the invasion of BTSCs by plotting the increasing cell area over time.\n\t\tNote: Data collection using commercial software (see Table of Materials) can be executed by launching the processing definition created in step 3.10.1, clicking on Metrics, then on Graph/export, and then on Data export."
