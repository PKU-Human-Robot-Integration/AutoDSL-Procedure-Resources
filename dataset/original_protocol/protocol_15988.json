    "Although mammalian reoviruses will grow in many different cell types, mouse L929 cells are preferred to use for in vitro cell culture and manipulation because the virus grows to high titer, and these cells are easily manipulated in suspension and monolayer forms. The propagation of reovirus stocks is performed by a series of passages. Typical virus passaging is described below.\nMaterials\nMouse L929 cells (ATCC #CCL-1)\nNeutral red–stained plate containing virus plaques (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-prot-0003])\nGel saline (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-rec-0005])\n25-cm2 tissue culture flask with pre-attached L929 cell monolayer (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-prot-0006])\nComplete Joklik's Minimum Essential Medium (J-MEM) (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-rec-0008])\nPenicillin-streptomycin solution, 100× (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-rec-0011])\nAmphotericin B working solution, 1000× (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-rec-0001])\n75-cm2 tissue culture flask(s) with pre-attached L929 cell monolayer (see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-prot-0006])\nCotton-plugged Pasteur pipets, sterile\n1- or 2-dram glass vials, sterile\nAdditional reagents and equipment for obtaining neutral red–stained plates containing virus plaques (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-prot-0003])\nNOTE: All solutions and materials that come into contact with cells must be sterile, with proper aseptic techniques used.\nNOTE: All cell culture incubations utilize a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 unless otherwise stated.\nP0 (passage zero)\n1. To pick a virus plaque from a neutral red–stained plate (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-prot-0003]):\n         \nSqueeze the rubber bulb on a sterile cotton-plugged Pasteur pipet to expel the air.\nInsert the tip of the pipet through the agar overlay into the plaque area, until the pipet touches the cell monolayer.\nRotate the pipet while slowly releasing the rubber bulb to suck up the agar and cells in the selected area.\nTo ensure a pure virus clone, pick only plaques that are separated from other plaques on the agar plate by ≥1 cm (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6dd2a646-eaf0-4a77-8aec-89959d900a73/cpz1716-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",
    "Picking virus plaques from agar plates. Well separated plaques, such as depicted in the green circle, should be picked whereas plaques close to each other (red circle) should be avoided.\n2. Expel the picked plaque into 1 ml of gel saline in a sterile 1- or 2-dram glass vial.\nIt is generally advisable to pick three to five plaques (in case spontaneous random mutants are present) and screen each clone to ensure plaques represent parental viruses.\n3. Store P0 virus stock at 4°C for ≥8 hr to allow virus to diffuse out of agar plug.\nP1 (first passage)\n4. Pour out medium from a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask that contains a pre-attached L929 cell monolayer.\n5. Inoculate 0.5 ml of P0 virus stock into the flask.\n6. Incubate the flask 1 hr at room temperature to allow virus to adsorb.\nGently rock the flask every 10 to 12 min to disperse liquid overlay and prevent any regions of the monolayer from drying out.\n7. Add 4 ml of fresh complete J-MEM (supplemented with 40 µl 100× penicillin/streptomycin solution and 4 µl 1000× amphotericin B working solution) to the flask.\n8. Incubate the flask at 37°C until ∼85% cytopathic effect (CPE).\nIf using plug-seal cap flasks, ensure cap is loose to allow gas exchange. Examine flask daily and \"beat\" flask (by rapping against hand) every few days to disperse infected cells.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: If using plug-seal cap flasks, tighten cap to ensure it does not fall off during rapping step!\n9. Freeze-thaw three times by alternately placing the flask at less than –70°C and at room temperature for three complete cycles.\n10. Transfer the sample into a labeled 2-dram vial and store at 4°C.\nP2 (second passage)",
    "11. Infect a pre-attached L929 cell monolayer in one or more 75-cm2 tissue culture flask(s) with 0.5 ml of P1 (from step 10). Use essentially the same procedure as for P1 passage, except add 11 ml of complete J-MEM per flask and store either in multiple 2-dram vials or in larger containers (i.e., small sterile media bottles).\nThe virus stocks can then be titrated to determine the amount of virus (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-prot-0003]). Plaques produced from the titration can serve as fresh P0 to replenish stocks. Stocks are stable at 4°C for long periods of time (i.e., years).",

Pour 6.5 × 108 suspension-grown L929 cells into 250-ml centrifuge bottles.",
    "2. Spin cells in a refrigerated centrifuge 12 min at ∼350 × g, 4°C.\n3. Pour 250 ml of the supernatant into the glass roller bottle (use supernatant as pre-adapted medium; pre-adapted medium = \"conditioned\" medium that contains growth factors and reduces costs), and discard the remaining supernatant.\n4. Resuspend and pool the pelleted cells into fresh complete J-MEM so that after addition of virus P2 stock (next step) the concentration will be ≤2 × 107 cells/ml.\nTry to keep the cell concentration as close as possible to 2 × 107 cells/ml, without going over.\n5. Add virus at an MOI of ∼5 PFU/cell.\n6. Adsorb virus for 1 hr at room temperature with periodic swirling.\n7. During adsorption, complete the glass roller bottle medium:\n         \nAdd 700 ml fresh complete J-MEM, 11 ml 100× penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 1.5 ml 1000× amphotericin B working solution.\nPlace into a 33°C spinning water bath to equilibrate.\n8. After the 1 hr adsorption, pour infected cell suspension into pre-equilibrated roller bottle.\nThe final cell concentration should not exceed 6.5 × 105 cells/ml.\n9. Incubate, with spinning, ∼65 hr at 33°C.\nAlternatively, if checking incubation time by hemocytometer counting, incubate until ∼40% of the cells remain alive.\n10. After incubation, pellet cells using a refrigerated centrifuge in 250-ml centrifuge tubes 30 min at ∼500 × g.\nPour supernatant into collection container and add bleach to supernatant before discarding.\n11. Resuspend pelleted cells in 22 ml of HO buffer. Note the final volume of resuspended cells (should be 24 to 26 ml) and transfer into two 30-ml COREX tubes.\nThe suspension may be frozen and stored at –80°C at this step, or used immediately for purification.\nPerform virus purification\n12. Thaw HO suspension if frozen, and place tubes on ice.",
    "The suspension MUST be kept cold through the following steps.\n13. Sonicate suspension sample to disrupt cells.\nUse a small probe at a mid-range setting for 10 s.\n14. Add 1/50th of the total volume recorded in step 11 of 10% DOC to each tube. Cover tubes with Parafilm and vortex the suspension 3 to 5 s.\n15. Let sit for 5 min, then vortex 3 to 5 s. Let the tubes sit for an additional 25 min.\n16. Add 2/5th of the total volume of Vertrel-XF to each tube and sonicate to mix the two layers and create an emulsion.\nUse a small probe at a mid-range setting for 30 s.\n17. Add the same amount of Vertrel-XF as in step 16 to each tube and sonicate again at the same setting.\nThe total volume of Vertrel-XF must be less than the aqueous volume to make an emulsion.\n18. Centrifuge suspension 10 min at ∼9000 × g in a refrigerated Super-speed centrifuge.\n19. Remove the top aqueous layers into fresh 30-ml COREX tubes with a plastic pipet, making sure to note the new volume.\n20. Add 9/10th the total volume noted above of Vertrel-XF to each tube and re-emulsify.\n21. Centrifuge again 10 min at ∼9000 × g to separate phases.\n22. During final phase separation, prepare a 1.2 g/ml and 1.44 g/ml cesium chloride gradient(s) in an SW-28 ultracentrifuge tube.\nCesium chloride solutions are filter sterilized and may be stored at room temperature for years. Gradients are prepared fresh for each use.",
    "A SW-28 ultracentrifuge tube holds ∼38 ml of fluid. Since the combined aqueous phases after Vertrel-XF purification represent ∼22 ml, the cesium chloride gradient is made by pipeting 8 ml of the 1.44 g/ml solution into the bottom of the tube and then pipeting 8 ml of the 1.22 g/ml solution on top. Effective gradient formation is achieved by initially pipeting the 1.2 g/ml solution \"roughly\" into the 1.44 g/ml solution to cause mixing. This is followed, as more and more 1.2 g/ml solution is added, by adding the 1.2 g/ml solution progressively more and more carefully so there is little mixing by the time the final few milliliters of 1.2 g/ml solution are added on top.\n23. Remove the aqueous phases from step 21 with a fresh pipet and layer contents of both COREX tubes onto a single 1.2-1.44 g/ml cesium chloride gradient.\n24. Centrifuge gradient ≥5 hr at ≥87,000 × g in an ultracentrifuge at ∼5°C.\n25. Collect the lower virus band by top, bottom, or side puncture into a sterile tube.\nYou may also collect the upper \"top component,\" which contains empty, genome-deficient, virus particles.\n26. Pipet collected virus band into prepared dialysis tubing and dialyze against three sets of dialysis buffer (D-buffer or 2× SSC) for ≥1 hr, then ≥3 hr, then ≥6 hr at ∼5°C.\nCAUTION: Sodium azide is toxic.\nDialysis tubing may be purchased prepared in sodium azide from several suppliers. Alternatively, dry dialysis tubing may be prepared as described in Sambrook et al. (1989[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-bib-0014]).\n27.

    "Mammalian reoviruses cause cytopathic effect (CPE) and eventual death of host cells. Because of this, infected monolayers will show zones of lysed cells (called plaques), which are essentially areas of infected cells. A plaque assay is used to quantify the amount of infectious virus in a sample, indicated by the number of plaques formed on a monolayer of mouse L929 cells. If the dilution of the virus sample is high enough, the plaque represents a single infectious particle that has infected a cell and continued to spread to the adjacent cells. Using this method of quantification, a virus titer can be calculated to units per milliliter. This particular plaque assay uses a neutral red stain to enhance visibility for counting purposes. The neutral red assay technique is also used to replenish P0 virus stocks when these stocks run low (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-prot-0001]).

    "For 12-well plates, all six dilutions can be used in duplicate.

Allow virus to adsorb on cell monolayer by incubating 1 hr at room temperature.\nGently rock flask every 10 to 12 min to disperse liquid overlay and prevent any regions of the monolayer from drying out.\n6. While waiting for virus to adsorb, melt the 2% agar in a microwave and place in a 62°C water bath.\nCalculate sufficient volume to allow overlay of all wells to be used.\nAgar is best melted by using 50% power, and swirling intermittently to ensure no solid clumps are present. The cap of the agar should be twisted slightly open prior to heating, to prevent the potentially explosive build up of hot gasses.\n7. Allow the agar to cool to 62°C in the water bath.\n8.

    "Mammalian reoviruses are fairly stable at 4°C, and they can be kept there for many months with little, if any, decline in infectivity (see Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-fig-0005]). The virus also maintains high infectivity at room temperature (∼22°C) for about a month, but it loses infectivity more rapidly at higher temperatures (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-fig-0005]). Large stocks of virus may also be divided into aliquots and kept frozen (less than –70°C) for years.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/28cbd755-f545-4439-ba53-a304a212c29d/cpz1716-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nInfectious reovirus survival when stored at various temperatures.",
    "Although mammalian reoviruses may infect many different types of cell lines, mouse L929 cells are the preferred cell line used to efficiently amplify and quantify the virus.

We routinely split L929 cells 1:5 on Mondays and Wednesdays, and 1:10 on Fridays. The single 150-cm2 flask may be scaled up or down as anticipated needs dictate. In general, cells can be split ∼1:2.5 to be nearly confluent (∼90% to 95% confluent; optimal for virus growth; see Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-fig-0006]) the next day; 1:5 to be confluent in ∼2 days; or 1:10 to be confluent in ∼3 days.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/77c06d5d-9056-4753-86d7-90e138925820/cpz1716-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nL929 cells at (A) 100× and (B) 400× magnification.\n1a.

    "3a. Add 2 ml of fresh PBS/EDTA/trypsin (at a final trypsin concentration of 2.5 mg/ml) into flask. Rock flask back and forth 2 to 3 times to completely cover bottom with trypsin mixture. Remove trypsin mixture.\n4a. Put flask into a 37°C incubator for ∼10 min. After the time has elapsed, check for loosening of cells under a microscope.\nGentle tapping of the bottom of the flask may help detach cells.\n5a. Pipet 5 ml of pre-adapted J-MEM (from step 1a) into trypsinized flask and titurate to wash cells off the bottom of the flask and break up clumps. Tituration is performed by placing the pipet against the flat bottom of the flask and expelling liquid to break up large cell clumps.\n6a. Remove all but 1 ml of cell suspension.\nThe remaining 4 ml may be discarded or used to set up additional flasks or plates for further applications (see Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-prot-0007]).\n7a. Add the remaining 5 ml of pre-adapted completed J-MEM (from step 1a) plus 24 ml of fresh medium.\n8a. Place the flask back into the incubator.\nPlastic tissue culture flasks may be re-used up to about a dozen times. If re-using plastic flasks, replace with new flasks every ∼12 splittings.\nTo ensure cells remain susceptible to infection, discard cells after high passages (∼6 months). Establish a new line from a low-passage frozen stock, which should be kept at –135°C or in liquid N2.\nPrepare suspension cultures\nThe steps that follow are based on 500 ml of cells kept in a 1000-ml flat-bottom glass “Florence” flask. These cells are checked each day and split back to a concentration of ∼5 × 105 cells/ml as follows:\n1b. With a sterile pipet, remove ∼1 ml of cell suspension from the flask containing mouse L929 cells.",
    "2b. Count the cell concentration using this 1 ml cell suspension in a hemacytometer (Stevenson, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.716#cpz1716-bib-0018]).\n3b. Calculate required amount of cell suspension needed to reduce stock solution to 5 × 105 cells/ml.\n4b.

Add fresh complete J-MEM into the flask to return the volume to 500 ml and the cells to a concentration of ∼5 × 105 cells/ml. Place the flask back into the incubator.\nCells may occasionally be split to 2.2 × 105 cells/ml and left for 2 days (i.e., over weekends and holidays).\nReplace the glass Florence flask with another chromic acid–cleaned sterile one weekly.",

However, cells to be set up for use the same day should be set up only from suspension cultures. Trypsinized cells normally need to regenerate for ≥24 hr to allow efficient virus entry and replication."
