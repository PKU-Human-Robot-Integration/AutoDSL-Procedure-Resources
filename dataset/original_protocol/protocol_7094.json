    "Determine the desired number of samples per sequencing run (see Note 1 for limitations and considerations). This procedure is designed for the sequencing analysis of 384 samples, including both positive and negative controls (see Note 2), which are indexed, and subsequently pooled in three separate steps (see Note 3).Before starting, clean pipettes, racks, centrifuges, and surfaces in the LCM microscope and bench space with RNaseZap, to avoid RNA degradation.Primary neuronal culturesPrepare mammalian neuronal cultures according to protocol of choice. In our case, we culture neurons from the hippocampus or cortex of newborn rats (P1), as previously described (Aakalu et al., 2001).Plate cells on coverslips of MatTek 14mm diameter glass bottom dishes coated with a 0.1 mg/mL solution of poly-D-lysine, at a density of 20,000 cells/coverslip.Maintain plated cells in the cell medium of choice for at least 2 weeks and no longer than 5 weeks in culture for best confluency of neuronal processes. Unless cell age is a variable of interest, we strongly recommend that all neurons in an experiment share the same age, as the transcriptome may vary significantly over the lifespan of cultured neurons.Ethanol fixationDiscard cell medium.Wash cultures by adding 5 mL of 1× PBS and immediately discard it. Repeat once, for a total of 2 washes.Add 5 mL of cold 70% ethanol (kept at -20°C). Wait 5 min and discard ethanol.Seal the dish with parafilm and store at -80°C. RNA in cells will remain stable for at least 3 months.Laser capture microdissectionMake 4 separate cell lysis master mixes, differing in which of the 16 RT-UMI-Index (1-16) Primer is used (see Recipe 1). Keep on ice.Remove parafilm and cap from dish and place it on the DISH 35 CC adapter of a Zeiss PALM LCM microscope. Cells should be allowed to thaw for 5-10 min before dissection.",
    "Proceed to the next step in the meantime.Open the PALMRobo software. Using the 20× objective, identify and register locations for microdissection. We recommend the collection of no more than 48 samples per plate (see Note 1): the somata and dendritic arbors of 16 neurons amenable for dissection, 12 somata whose dendritic arbors are not amenable for collection, and 4 empty cuts (see Note 2). Thus, at this point the location of 28 neurons and 4 empty regions should be saved. Neurons amenable for collection have isolated somata free of processes, AND isolated dendritic arbors in which most processes can be unambiguously assigned to the same neuron (See example in Figure 1A and Supplementary File 2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210701/Suplementary File 2.pdf]). Avoid neurons at the edges of the coverslip, as these are inefficiently catapulted.Switch to the 40× objective, go to the first registered location, and take a picture.For somata or empty regions, select AutoLPC from the Cut Tools menu, and the circle drawing tool to delineate the soma or region of interest. For dendrites, select LineAutoLPC from the Cut Tools menu, and the free-hand drawing tool to delineate processes. Because of the continuous nature of neuronal compartments, there is no obvious point where the soma ends and dendrites begin, and thus what we consider the border between the two compartments is ultimately arbitrary. In our experiments, we delineate the soma as the cellular area containing and surrounding the nucleus, which dilates out until drastic decrements in width suddenly occur. The processes that continue are considered dendrites. However, processes that are qualitatively thinner than the rest are excluded as these might be axons (see example in Figure 1A, Supplementary File 2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210701/Suplementary File 2.pdf], and Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

    "Place cap of an AdhesiveCap-200 clear tube in the microscope’s RoboMover containing the SingleCap Collector II 200 RM. Cut the stretch of the tube linking the cap to the tube, and discard the tube.Click on Capture Device icon, go to the Adjust tab, and set working height to -12,500. Go to Operation, and double-click on top of the cap icon. This will bring the cap in the collection position above the culture dish. Adjust focus if necessary, to obtain a clear image of the neuron.Set the following parameters for Laser Pressure Catapulting (LPC): Energy = 40, focus = 70%, and speed = 15%.Go to the Colors icon on the Graphic toolbar, and on the LPC Distances tab set the Distance of AutoLPC shots to 2. This determines the density of the LPC punches.Go to Element List, and select only the element delineating the soma. Click on the Start Cutting Laser icon. The area delineating the soma will be catapulted to the collection cap in many individual punches.Click on Capture Device icon, go to the Operation tab, and click on the Home icon. This will bring the cap back to the loading position.Using curved forceps, carefully remove the cap from the collection arm and place it on a surface, with the side where the material was catapulted into facing up.Add 3 µL of the respective Cell lysis master mix to the cap containing the catapulted material.Using curved forceps, carefully place the cap in a well of a 96-well DNA LoBind plate, with the side where the material was catapulted into facing down.Repeat steps 5 to 7.Go to Element List and select all of the elements delineating the dendrites of that particular neuron. Click on the Start Cutting Laser icon.",
    "The area delineating each dendrite will be catapulted to the collection cap in many individual punches.Repeat steps 11 to 14.Repeat steps 5 to 17 for each location registered in step 3. We recommend organizing samples shown in Figure 4A in each 96-well plate.Proceed immediately to the next step.Cell lysisSeal the plate containing collection caps tightly with Microseal B adhesive film, turn it upside down, and vortex the side containing caps for 15 s.Centrifuge plate for 1 min in plate spinner, or centrifuge for 1min at 1,000 × g, to bring volumes from the cap to the bottom of the well.

This should result in a plate with 4 rows in which each well contains ~112 µL of pooled sample.Add 112 µL of AMPure Magnetic Beads to each well. Seal plate. Mix well by vortexing.Let plate stand at room temperature for 5 min.Place plate in magnetic stand. Let stand for 5 min.Prepare fresh 80% ethanol, considering that 48 pooled samples require ~22 mL of 80% ethanol.Place 80% ethanol solution in 25 mL reservoir.Discard supernatant from every well containing pooled samples, being careful not to disrupt the magnetic bead pellet.",
    "Add 200 µL of freshly-made 80% ethanol to each well. Wait 30 s and remove.Repeat previous step one more time, making sure to discard all ethanol at the end (may require additional pipetting out).Let plate stand in magnetic stand for 5 min, or until the bead pellet looks dry. If cracks begin to appear in the pellet, proceed immediately to next step.Remove plate from magnetic stand, and add 17.5 µL of Elution Buffer (EB) on top of pellet.Resuspend pellet by vortexing and, if necessary, by repeatedly pipetting elution volume on top of pellet.Wait 5 min.Place tube back on magnetic stand and wait 2 min.Transfer 15 µL of supernatant to wells in a new 96-well DNA LoBind plate.Combine supernatant from 2 pooled samples derived from the same source (i.e., somata, dendrites, or empty cuts) that contained no overlap in the 8 indexes pooled in step 2 (see Figure 4). Thus, this mix will contain 16 different indexes, each representing a different sample.Quality metrics of cDNA librariesCheck concentration of the 24 pooled samples using Qubit dsDNA BR Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.
