    "1. Preparation of Cell Culture Media and Reagents\nPrepare the complete cell culture medium R10 by adding the supplements of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate into the RPMI-1640 medium.\nPrepare the selection culture medium R10-Z by adding the antibiotics Zeocin (200 μg/mL) to R10 for maintaining the expression of SEAP under the control of NF-κB/AP-1 activation. To select for cells expressing both SEAP and luciferase reporter genes, add both Zeocin (100 μg/mL) and blasticidin (10 μg/mL) to R10 (as R10-ZB).\nPrepare the SEAP substrate solution by dissolving one pouch of the substrate powder (e.g., QUANTI-Blue) into 100 mL ultrapure, endotoxin free water in a clean 125 mL glass flask.\nSwirl the solution gently and incubate it at 37 °C for 1 h to ensure the complete dissolution of the substrates.\nFilter the solution using a 0.2 μm membrane to ensure its sterility (optional), and store it at 4 °C up to 2 weeks prior to use.\nPrepare the luciferase substrate solution by dissolving one pouch of the substrate powder (e.g., QUANTI-Luc) into 25 mL ultrapure, endotoxin free water in a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube.\n\t\nAfter dissolving the powder completely, use the solution immediately. Alternatively, store the solution at 4 °C (up to a week) or at -20 °C (up to a month) prior to use.\n\t\tCAUTION: Both substrate solutions are light sensitive, and should avoid light exposure whenever is possible. Multiple freeze-thaw cycles of the solution can cause instability of the substrate and shorten its shelf-life.\nPrepare the stock solution of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in molecular grade dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to have a concentration of 500 μg/mL. Make aliquots of the stock solution (10 μL in a 500 μL tube) and store them at -20 °C.",
    "Prepare LPS (E-coli K12) stock solution in sterile, endotoxin free water at a concentration of 5 mg/mL, and make aliquots for long-term storage at -20 °C. Prepare a working LPS solution by diluting the stock LPS into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 100 μg/mL and store at -20 °C prior to use.\n\tCAUTION: The reagent preparation for culture uses should be carried out in a biosafety cabinet, and all the containers should be sterilized prior to use. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles of PMA and LPS solutions should be avoided.\n2. Culture of THP-1 reporter cell-derived macrophages\nUse two THP-1 reporter cell lines: THP-1-XBlue and THP-1-Dual cells. The former has a SEAP reporter gene controlled by NF-κB/AP-1, and the latter has a dual reporter gene system, the same SEAP reporter gene and a IRF controlled luciferase gene. Their culture procedures are identical except the selection culture media.\nThaw a working cell stock (~5 x 106 cells) in 10 mL of R10 medium, spin down the cells at 300 x g for 5 min. Resuspend cells in 10 mL of R10 medium, and transfer them into a T75 culture flask. Exchange the culture medium every 2-3 days until cells reach a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\nWhen cell growth reaches its capacity, passage cells to reduce the cell density to in the range of 2-5 x 105 cells/mL, so the cells can continue to grow.\nAfter at least 1 passage, start to culture the cells in the selection culture medium: R10-Z for THP-1-XBlue, and R10-ZB for THP-1-Dual. After culturing the cells with selection culture medium for at least 1 passage, cells are ready for the experiment.",
    "CAUTION: Cell overgrowing can lead to significant cell death; the cell viability should maintain >98%. Keep a record of the passage number as the cells may behave differently after many passages (> 20 passages).\n\t\tNOTE: Cell culture flasks can be reused several times to save costs; however, this practice may increase the risk of general contamination and cross-contamination among different flasks (if handling different cell lines at the same time). During media exchange and cell passage, the centrifugation is set at 300 x g for 5 min.\nTo perform reporter cell assay, seed cells into a 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plate and differentiate them into macrophages. The procedures are described in the following.\nTransfer the cells from the flask to a centrifuge tube, spin down the cells at 300 x g for 5 min, and resuspend them in the R10 medium at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL. Add aliquots of the PMA solution into the cell suspensions with a final concentration of 50 ng/mL.\nTransfer 100 μL of the cell suspensions into each well of the 96-well plate using a multi-channel pipette. Incubate the plate at 37 °C (in a cell culture incubator) for 24 h.\nAfter incubation, carefully remove the culture medium using a vacuum aspirator (or with a multi-channel pipette), and gently wash the cells with PBS (100 μL/well) twice; add 100 μL of fresh R10 medium in each well. Rest the cells for 2 days in an incubator before conducting the reporter assay.\n\t\tCAUTION: The resting step is very important to allow cells to calm down after PMA stimulation to their normal quiet status. This can significantly reduce the background signals of the reporter genes under unstimulated conditions.",
    "NOTE: After 24 stimulation with PMA, cells are differentiated into macrophage-like phenotype, with a characteristic of cell adhesion at the bottom of the well, and a morphological feature of pseudopodia.\n3. Screening for Potential TLR4 Nano-inhibitors Using the Reporter Cells\nNOTE: Since TLR4 signaling utilizes both MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways, it is selected as the primary target to encompass a wide range of TLR signaling pathways. THP-1-XBlue reporter cells are used to mainly examine the NF-κB/AP-1 activation while THP-1-Dual cells are for IRF activation from the TRIF-dependent signal transduction.\nIdentify the optimal LPS dose by generating a dose-response curve prior to the screening.\nDilute the working LPS solution to a final concentration of 0.01 - 100 ng/mL in R10 medium (make dilution in log10 scale). Layout the plate design and make dilution in a 96-well round-bottom culture plate. Make sure that each well has a minimum of 110 μL of solution after dilution.\nGently remove the culture medium from the cell-seeded plate (from 2.2.3) using a vacuum aspirator.\nTransfer the LPS containing R10 medium prepared in the dilution plate (3.1.1) into the culture plate according to the layout of the samples. Incubate the plate at 37 °C (in a cell culture incubator) for 24 h.\nAt 24 h, carefully transfer the supernatants (80 μL/well) into a new 96-well round-bottom plate. Conduct the colorimetric and/or luciferase luminescence assay on these solutions immediately or store them at 4 °C (several hours) or -20 °C (days) prior to the assay development.",
    "NOTE: The design of plate layout should be simple and clear for experiment and data analysis. For each condition, 2-4 replicates should be considered. Always include a negative control group (LPS null). It is recommended to use THP-1-XBlue cells for NF-κB/AP-1 activation as the Dual cells have a relatively high background of NF-κB/AP-1 activation after being differentiated into macrophages. However, it is feasible to use the Dual cells for reporting both NF-κB/AP-1 and IRF activation.\nDevelop the colorimetric assay for the NF-κB/AP-1 activation and the luciferase luminescence assay for IRF activation.\nTo assess the NF-κB/AP-1 activation, transfer 20 μL of supernatant of each sample into a new 96-well flat-bottom culture plate; and add 180 μL of pre-warmed SEAP substrate solution into each well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 1 - 2 h to allow the color development (pink to dark blue). Collect the absorption at 655 nm on a plate reader.\n\t\tCAUTION: The incubation time can be varied based on the color development (30 min up to overnight incubation). It is recommended to wait until the optical density (O.D.) of the darkest color reaches above 1, while avoiding the saturation of the color development (O.D >3).\nFor the analysis of IRF activation, transfer 10 μL of supernatant of each sample into a 96-well clear flat-bottom white plate. Add the luciferase solution (50 μL) and immediately collect the luminescence well by well.\n\t\tNOTE: It is highly recommended to use a luminescence plate reader with an auto-injection function to ensure the consistency in the luminescence reading from well to well and from plate to plate. If the substrate solutions are manually injected, please ensure a consistent  incubation time and reading set-up for each well.",
    "Conduct the screening assay on various peptide-GNP hybrids with 10 ng/mL LPS stimulation (based on 3.1). Follow the same procedure in 3.2 for the reporter assay development.\nConcentrate the peptide-GNP hybrids to 200 nM in R10 medium using the centrifugation method. Centrifuge 20 volumes of the hybrid solution (10 nM) at 18,000 x g for 30 min, and carefully discard the supernatants. Collect the hybrids (at the bottom of the tube) into a tube, wash them with PBS twice, and re-suspend the hybrids in one volume of the R10 medium.\nMix equal volumes of the concentrated hybrids and the LPS (20 ng/mL) containing R10 medium to have a final concentration of the hybrids and LPS to be 100 nM and 10 ng/mL, respectively.\nRemove the culture medium from the cultured plate (2.2.3) and add 100 μL of the mixed solution into each well (3 replicates for each condition); include a negative control (medium only) and a LPS control (10 ng/mL LPS without hybrids).\nAfter 24 h incubation at 37 °C, transfer the medium of each well into a tube and centrifuge the tubes at 18,000 x g, 4 °C for 30 min. Collect the supernatants (50-80 μL/tube) into a 96-well round-bottom plate, and perform the reporter assay as described in 3.2.\n\t\tCAUTION: When discarding the supernatants after centrifugation, do not agitate the hybrids at the bottom of the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The centrifugation in the step 3.3.4 is very important to remove the non-internalized nanoparticle hybrids from the culture medium, and can avoid the interference of the hybrids with the colorimetric/luminescence readings. This is because the gold nanoparticles can absorb wide wavelengths of light depending on their size and agglomeration.\n4. Validating the Inhibitory Effect of the Potential Candidates",
    "NOTE: To confirm the inhibitory effect of the potential candidates from the screening, two approaches are employed. One is to examine the dose responses of the stimulants (LPS) at a fixed hybrid concentration (or the other way around); the other is to directly look at the inhibition on the NF-κB/AP-1 and IRF3 signals via immunoblotting.\nIn approach one, perform the reporter assay with 100 nM of the lead hybrids and two LPS concentrations at 1 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL following the same procedures described in 3.3. Include an inactive hybrid (based on the screening results) as a hybrid control for comparison.\nFor the immunoblotting approach, please follow the standard experimental procedures.\nCulture THP-1 cells in R10 medium, seed the cells into a 12-well culture plate (2 x 106 cells/well), and differentiate them into macrophages by treating the cells with 50 ng/mL PMA for 24 h followed by resting for 2 days.\nAfter cell differentiation, stimulate cells with 10 ng/mL LPS with/without the hybrids (100 nM) over time (up to 4 h). At various time points (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min), prepare the cell lysates for immunoblotting. Include an inactive hybrid as a control.\nProbe the signals of IκBα, phosphorylated p65, and phosphorylated IRF3 to examine the inhibitory effect of the lead hybrids on the activation of NF-κB and IRF3. Probe the β-actin and total IRF3 signals as internal controls.\n\t\tNOTE: The signal transduction often occurs much faster (in a few hours) then the expression of the reporter enzymes SEAP and luciferase (24 h). It is highly recommended to also perform a viability assay of the tested hybrids at 24 h as another validation method.\n5. Evaluating the TLR Specificity",
    "NOTE: To investigate the TLR specificity of the lead peptide-GNP hybrid, other TLR signaling pathways are tested, including TLR2, TLR3 and TLR5. TLR7, 8 and 9 are excluded because the THP-1 derived macrophages do not respond well to the stimulation of these TLRs due to the lack of TLR7, 8 and 9 expression in macrophages34.\nTest various concentrations (1 ng/mL to 25 μg/mL) of the ligands specific to TLR2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR3 (poly I:C) and TLR5 (flagellin) on both reporter cells derived macrophages to obtain the optimal concentration following the same procedure in 3.1 and 3.2.\nTreat the cells with the mixtures of the lead hybrid (100 nM) and each TLR ligand at the concentration obtained from 5.1 to evaluate the inhibitory specificity of the lead hybrid according to the experimental procedure described in 3.3. Include the inactive hybrid as a control for comparison.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
