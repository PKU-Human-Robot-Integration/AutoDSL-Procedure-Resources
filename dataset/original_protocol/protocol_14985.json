    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB).\n1. Preparation for Testing Session\nParticipants should follow these restrictions for most accurate measurements: 12 hr fast from food and caffeine, 12 hr restraint from exercise, 12 hr restraint from smoking, if applicable, >4 half-life restraint from medications if possible (may not be feasible in a population such as CKD patients), and pre-menopausal women should be tested in days 1-7 of the menstrual cycle to minimize hormonal influences.\nPrepare 500 ml of the dissociation buffer by adding 2 ml of 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.05 g of heparin (180 USP units/ mg), and 2.5 g of bovine serum albumin to 476.8 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH of 7.4. This can be stored at 4 °C for several months.\nTurn on ultrasound, computer, and the Non-Invasive Hemodynamic Workstation (NIHem; arterial stiffness equipment). Connect cables outputting the ultrasound to the computer R-wave trigger box.\n2. Collection and Processing of Vascular Endothelial Cells\nA trained nurse or physician performs the collection (steps 2.2-2.5, 2.7) and a researcher collects and processes the wires (steps 2.6, 2.8-2.19)\nPrep the antecubital site with a topical antiseptic, apply a tourniquet, locate vein, and cannulate with an 18 G catheter. Place a heplock adapter on the end of the IV.\nPut on sterile gloves and put sterile fenestrated drapes over the site.\nPlace 2 J-wires on the drapes. Pull the arc of the \"J\" to uncoil the \"J\" shape from both wires.\nUncap the heplock and feed J-wire into vein approximately 8 cm. Push back and forth several times before removing the wire. Avoid gross blood on the wire.\nUse wire cutters to snip the wires so they fit in a 50 ml conical tube containing ~30 ml of dissociation buffer",
    "Repeat step 2.5 for second wire.\nRepeat step 2.6 for second wire. Return tube to wet laboratory.\nClasp the wires with a pair of forceps and hold the wires inside of the tube, but above the solution. For 10 min, use a motorized pipetter to repeatedly collect the dissociation buffer from the 50 ml conical tube and release it so it runs down the length of the wires to rinse and vibrate the wires, then shake off excess fluid from wires into tube.\nCentrifuge for 7 min at 400 x g and 4 °C.\nPrepare the formaldehyde solution in foil covered tube by combining 100 ml formaldehyde solution + 900 ml PBS.\nSlowly remove tube from centrifuge, turn on the vacuum pump, place a pipette tip on end of suction hose and leave ~400 ml in the tube, vacuuming off the rest without disturbing the pellet.\nCover with foil and pipette 1 ml formaldehyde solution into the tube to fix the sample. Do not resuspend. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nPrepare 8 slides by labeling with subject and study visit information and drawing an oval on each slide with a pap pen.\nAdd 15 ml PBS, resuspend, and centrifuge for 5 min at 400 x g and 4 °C.\nRepeat step 2.15, add 12 ml PBS, resuspend, and centrifuge for 6 min at 400 x g and 4 °C.\nSlowly remove tube from centrifuge, turn on the vacuum pump, place a pipette tip on end of suction hose and leave ~2 ml in the tube, vacuuming off the rest without disturbing the pellet.\nResuspend and pipette evenly across the 8 slides in the oval areas.",
    "Place in incubator at 37 °C for 5 hr and then store at -80 °C until ready for analysis (samples will be fine for many years).\n3. Assessment of FMDBA and aPWV\nHave research subject change into disposable shorts and have him/her lie supine in a quiet, dim, climate controlled room.\nPlace the appropriate number of ECG for the specific ultrasound and arterial stiffness device (this procedure uses the Non-Invasive Hemodynamic Workstation [NIHem] to measure arterial stiffness, which requires 4 electrodes), and blood pressure cuff on subject.\nAfter 20 min, begin blood pressure readings. Perform at least 3, and repeat until measurements are within 5 mmHg, resting 2 min between each reading.\nBegin tonometry by palpating for the brachial artery pulse and placing the tonometer to record brachial waveforms using the software program.\nRepeat for the radial, femoral and carotid arteries.\nMeasure the distance to each of these sites from the supersternal notch using a tape measure (brachial, radial and carotid) and custom ruler/caliper (femoral).\nCalculate carotid-brachial, carotid-radial, and carotid-femoral (aPWV) using the software program.\nPlace forearm blood pressure cuff just distal to the olecranon process and record at least 10 cardiac cycles of baseline brachial artery ultrasound images and blood flow velocity measurements, with a vascular software set to trigger mode. A mechanical arm can be used to steady the ultrasound probe if desired.\nInflate forearm blood pressure cuff to 250 mmHg and begin timer. Instruct participant to remain very still.\nBegin recording velocities with a vascular software set to trigger mode when the timer reads 4:45. Trigger release the cuff at 5:00 and change the ultrasound to record B-mode (diameter) images when the clock reads 5:10.\nContinue recording until the clock reads 7:00.",
    "Record at least 10 cardiac cycles of baseline brachial artery ultrasound images with a vascular software set to trigger mode.\nTake subject's blood pressure. If systolic blood pressure >100 mmHg, place 0.4 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin under the subject's tongue and begin timer, unless the patient has another contraindication.\nBegin recording B-mode (diameter images) when the clock reads 3:00 with the vascular software set to trigger mode.\nStop recording when the clock reads 8:00.\nMonitor blood pressure until it returns to baseline\n4. Preparing Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell (HUVEC) Control Slides\nGrow HUVECs to passage 5-6 and ~80% confluency.\nTrypsinize with 3 ml of trypsin or whatever is necessary for the dish/flask.\nNeutralize trypsin using an equal volume of trypsin neutralizing solution.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for ~5 min and remove trypsin and neutralizing solution by vacuum.\nResuspend in ~10 ml PBS to wash.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g ~5 min. Remove PBS.\nRemove PBS and fix in 1800 μl PBS + 200 μl formaldehyde.\nResuspend in PBS (~10 ml).\nCentrifuge at 200 x g ~5 min. Remove PBS, resuspend in an appropriate volume to add ~200 μl per slide.\nStore slides at -80 °C until ready for analysis (samples will be fine for many years).\n5. Staining of Vascular Endothelial Cells\nTake slides out of -80 °C freezer and wait 5 min at room temperature (this procedure is for a batch of 10 slides, including one HUVEC control slide).\nWipe away excess water with a delicate task wipe (don't touch center of slide).\nRe-hydrate the slides by adding altered PBS to each slide and leave them for 10 min.\nWhile the slides are standing, prepare 5% donkey serum and other solutions.",
    "Prepare 5% donkey serum by adding 300 μl of donkey serum to 5,700 μl of altered PBS (to a pH of 7.4) for up to 10 slides (increase this amount for more).\nDilute the primary antibody of interest in 1,000 μl of 5% serum. For example, nitrotyrosine and NADPH oxidase (1:300 and 1:1,500) could be used as markers of oxidative stress.\nPrepare secondary AF568 by diluting 5 μl of AF568 to 1,500 μll of 5% serum.\nPrepare VE cadherin by diluting 2 μl of VE Cadherin to 1,000 μl of 5% serum.\nPrepare AF488 by diluting 5 μl of VE Cadherin to 1,000 μl of 5% serum.\nKeep AF568, VE cadherin and AF488 under foil through the whole process and then place on rocker in 4 °C refrigerator while preparing slides.\nAfter 10 min of rehydration, dry slides with a delicate task wipe.\nAdd 5% donkey serum for 60 min and place a piece of plastic paraffin film over the circled area to ensure complete coverage of the chemical.\nDiscard the plastic paraffin film and dry slides with a delicate task wipe. Do not wash. Add primary antibody for 60 min and place a piece of plastic paraffin film over the circled area to ensure complete coverage of the chemical.\nDiscard the plastic paraffin film, rinse with altered PBS from squirt bottle and soak in slide columns for 5 min. While the slides are soaking, move them into a dark room. Work in the dark for all remaining steps.\nDry slides with Kimwipes, add AF568 (secondary antibody) for 45 min and place a piece of plastic paraffin film over the circled area to ensure complete coverage of the chemical. Cover from light.",
    "Discard the plastic paraffin film in the biohazard waste container. Rinse with altered PBS from squirt bottle, and then soak in columns for 5 min.\nDry slides with Kimwipes, then add VE Cadherin for 60 min and place a piece of plastic paraffin film over the circled area to ensure complete coverage of the chemical. Cover from light.\nDiscard the plastic paraffin film in the biohazard waste container. Rinse with altered PBS from squirt bottle, and then soak in columns for 5 min.\nDry slides with a delicate task wipe, add AF488 for 30 min and place a piece of plastic paraffin film over the circled area to ensure complete coverage of the chemical. Cover from light.\nDiscard the plastic paraffin film in the biohazard waste container. Rinse with altered PBS from squirt bottle, and then soak in columns for 5 min.\nDry slides with a delicate task wipe and allow slides to dry for 20 min. Cover from light.\nAdd one drop only of fluoroshield mounting medium with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) to each slide and cover each with a cover slip.\nPlace slides in 4 °C refrigerator covered with foil. Imaging needs to be completed within 48 hr.\n6. Imaging and Analysis of Vascular Endothelial Cells\nPrepare microscope for imaging stained endothelial cells according to specifications of the specific microscope. A single blinded technician should analyze any particular protein for a batch of cells.\nScan slides systematically. Identify endothelial cells by positive staining for VE Cadherin and confirm nuclear integrity by positive staining for DAPI.\nImage 30 cells per slide for later analysis. Repeat for each slide in the stained batch, including the HUVEC.\nAnalyze the intensity of the staining for the primary antibody of interest using a qualitative software .",
    "To minimize the possible confounding effect of differences in intensity staining between different staining sessions, report values as ratio of protein expression in the collected endothelial cells to the same protein expression in the HUVEC.\nSubscription Required.
