    "Animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and all methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. For this study, CD-1 outbred mice had ad libitum access to normal rodent chow and water; they were maintained in a 12:12 dark: light cycle.\n1. Preparation of required media\nFor base media (OMM), add 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM KH2PO4, and 1.7 mM CaCl2-2H2O to 100 mL sterile water.\n\tNOTE: OMM medium can be stored for up to 1 month.\nFor complete media (OMOPS), add 20 mM 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS), 1.2 mM MgSO4-7H2O, 0.5 mM glucose, 6 mM L-lactate, 1 mM ala-gln, 0.1 mM taurine, 1x non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 0.01 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10 µM alpha lipoic acid, 10 µg/mL undiluted gentamicin, 21 mM 1 M NaOH, 5 mM NaHCO3, 0.2 mM Pyruvate, 0.5 mM Citrate, 4 mg/mL FAF BSA to a 1:10 dilution of OMM in sterile water for a total volume of 100 mL. Sterilize the medium with a 0.22 µM filter.\n\tNOTE: OMOPS can be stored for up to 1 week.\nFor the holding medium (HM) add 5% fetal bovine serum to OMOPS. Make 2 mL HM per mouse.\nFor hyaluronidase solution add 0.1 mg/mL of hyaluronidase derived from bovine testes, to 1 mL HM.\nFor the fixation buffer combine 4% paraformaldehyde in 10 mL of 1x PBS along with 0.1% embryo grade polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)14.\nTo prepare 50 mL wash buffer (WB), add 0.1% non-ionic surfactant and 0.1% PVP to 1x PBS14.\nTo Prepare 10 mL permeabilization buffer, add 1% non- ionic surfactant to 1x PBS14.\n\tNOTE: The wash and permeabilization buffers described above replace the proprietary buffers in the commercially available kits.",
    "2. Collection of ovulated oocytes from female mice\nPreparation:\n\t\nStimulate female mice at 5-8 weeks of age by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 5 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) followed by 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 44-48 h later15,16.\nKeep 35 mm Petri dishes containing 2 mL of HM on a 37 °C warming plate. Pipette one, 100-µL drop of HM containing diluted hyaluronidase followed by three, 50 µL drops of HM without hyaluronidase in a 60 mm petri dish. Place plates containing drops on the 37 °C warming plate prior to use.\n\t\tNOTE: The hyaluronidase drops should be made just prior to the dissection of each oviduct pair to prevent the evaporation and concentration of the components of HM with or without hyaluronidase.\nEuthanize mice, 16 h after the IP injection of hCG, using isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation.\nClean the mouse using 70% ethanol. Expose the abdominal cavity and visualize the female reproductive tract. Hold the ovary with forceps and remove the uterine ligaments and excess adipose tissue from around the ovary. Cut the oviduct from the uterus and place the ovary-oviduct pair in the warm HM in the 35 mm dish.\nRemove the ovary and any surrounding adipose tissue. Tear the swollen ampulla of the oviduct using a ½ inch 27-gauge needle. Push the oviduct at the site of the tear and the cumulus cell-oocyte complexes (COCs) will be expelled. Transfer the ovulated oocytes, which are presumed to be in metaphase II (MII) of meiosis, to the 100 μL drop containing HM media with hyaluronidase using a mouth pipette (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59414/59414fig2.jpg",

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59414/59414fig2large.jpg]\nPipette the MII oocyte-cumulus cell complexes up and down in the hyaluronidase containing HM with the mouth pipette to dislodge cumulus cells. Transfer each oocyte, once they are devoid of cumulus cells to a wash drop containing HM only using the mouth pipette. Repeat this for each wash droplet. Do not transfer fragmented or transparent oocytes15.\n\tNOTE: It is important to transfer the oocytes from each drop in the 35 mm dish with as little HM as possible. This is true for every transfer in the protocol. The MII oocytes must not remain in the hyaluronidase containing HM medium for more than one minute.\n3. SM-FISH Staining of Oocytes\nFix oocytes in an individual well of a 6-well plate containing 500 µL of Fixation Buffer. Submerge 20 oocytes or less in the well. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Each SM-FISH staining step occurs within an individual well in a 6-well conical plate. Ensure that oocytes are completely submerged in buffers and not floating on top of the buffer. Each step should be performed with 20 oocytes or less in each well.\nTransfer fixed oocytes to 500 μL of wash buffer (WB described in step 1.6) for 10 min each. Repeat 2 more times.\nIncubate oocytes in permeabilization buffer for 30 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: The permeabilization buffer described in step 1.7 replaces the propriety permeabilization buffer.",
    "Gather probe sets and quickly spin them down in a microcentrifuge. Warm each probe set for 10 min in a 40 °C water bath or incubator. Cool to the room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: This step should be performed during the permeabilization incubation\nWash oocytes in 500 µL of WB for 10 min at room temperature.\nTransfer oocytes to 80 μL of Protease III Buffer (available from the kit), that is diluted 1:8 in 1X PBS, for 30 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: The 80 µL volume adequately covers the bottom of an individual well in a 6-well plate.\nWash oocytes in 500 µL of WB for 10 min at room temperature.\nDilute the warmed probe sets for Nanog, Pou5f1, and DapB (a negative control gene), 1:50 in probe diluent. Incubate oocytes in 80 μL of the transcript-specific probe for 2 hours at 40° C.\n\tNOTE: Each proprietary probe set is available in one of three fluorescence channels (C1, C2, and C3). The Nanog and Pou5f1 probes were tagged with C2 and C3, respectively.\nWarm the proprietary, Amplifier 1 (AMP 1), Amplifier 2 (AMP2), Amplifier 3 (AMP3) and Amplifier 4-fluorescence (AMP 4-FL) at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: This step should be performed during the 2-hour transcript-specific probe incubation.\nTransfer the oocytes to 500 μL of WB and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nIncubate oocytes sequentially in amplification buffers.\n\t\nIncubate oocytes in 80 µL of AMP1 for 30 min at 40° C. Transfer oocytes to 500 µL of WB for 10 min at room temperature.\nIncubate oocytes in 80 µL of AMP2 for 15 min at 40 °C. Transfer oocytes to 500 µL of WB for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Incubate the oocytes in 80 µL of AMP3 for 30 min at 40 °C. Transfer oocytes to 500 µL of WB for 10 min at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The remainder of the protocol is performed in the dark because AMP-FL contains the fluorophore. When working under the dissecting microscope, reduce the light as much as possible.\nAdd oocytes to 80 μL of AMP4-FL for 15 min at 40° C.\n\t\tNOTE: AMP4-FL is provided as alternative buffer-A (Alt-A), Alt-B or Alt-C. Select the AMP4-FL buffer dependent on which emission wavelength is desired.\nWash oocytes in 500 µL of WB for 10 min at room temperature. Incubate oocytes in 80 µL of DAPI for 20 min at room temperature. Wash oocytes in 500 µL of WB for 5 min at room temperature.\nPipette 12 µL of anti-fading mounting media onto the center of a slide without adding bubbles to the reagent. Transfer oocytes with as little WB as possible into the mounting media and apply a coverslip.\n\t\nTilt the coverslip at an angle and slowly and gently place over the liquid on the slide. Avoid pressing the coverslip too hard to prevent distortion of the oocytes and introduction of bubbles.\nStore the slides in a dark box to dry overnight at room temperature. Coat the edges of the slides in clear nail polish to seal coverslip.\nUse a standard microscope to find oocytes on the slide and circle with a permanent marker.\n\tNOTE: This step is not required but improves locating oocytes on the slide. For best results, image slides within 1 to 5 days as the fluorescent signal will begin to fade.\n4. Image Processing\nImage the 3-dimensional oocytes, using z step confocal microscopy.\n\tNOTE: To accurately analyze the images, each z step should be 1.0 µm/slice.",
    "Save confocal images as a compressed nd2 or individual .TIFF files for each oocyte. Both image types are compatible with the open source image processing program, Fiji.\nDownload and install the open access Fiji software (https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads). \n\t\nDrag nd2 files into Fiji and choose hyperstack. If confocal images were saved as .TIFF files skip to step 4.4.\n\t\tNOTE: When the nd2 file is dropped into Fiji the hyperstack dropdown should appear automatically.\nClick the Image tab, Select Color, and click Split Channels to separate the fluorescent channels of the nd2 file.\nGenerate individual .TIFF files for each z-slice of the oocyte in each fluorescent channel. Click the Image tab, select Stacks, and click Stack to Images. Click the Image tab, select Type, and click RGB Color to convert each z slice to an individual RGB color image.\n\t\tNOTE: The RGB color is artificial and can be chosen as desired for each emission wavelength.\nSave each converted image as .TIFF file. Place images from a single oocyte for each fluorescent channel in a new folder to avoid confusion during stitching (step 4.3).\nNormalize each .TIFF image for Pou5f1 and Nanog using negative control images (DapB).\n\tNOTE: Normalization is performed using a photo editing program. Make sure to remove the same levels of background fluorescence from each control image.\nOpen each normalized .TIFF file in Fiji to stitch together all z-slices for each oocyte in each wavelength.\n\t\nClick the Plugins tab, select Stitching, and click on Grid/Collection (Figure 3A). Select Sequential Images from the drop-down menu and click OK (Figure 3B).\nBrowse the directory and select the folder containing all of the z-slice images for an individual oocyte at one wavelength (see step 4.3.4). Click OK.",
    "Move the slider at the bottom of the stitched image to the appropriate color channel for the wavelength used and create the final RGB stitched image by clicking Image, selecting Type, and click RGB Color.\n\t\tNOTE: This image will be used for fluorescence quantitation described in step 4.6 below.\nConvert the stitched image to 32-bit maximum projected picture. Click Image, select Type, and click 32-bit (Figure 3C). Save this image as a new .TIFF file.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59414/59414fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Stitching together of confocal z-series images of oocytes.

Larson, an investigator at the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute (https://ccr.cancer.gov/Laboratory-of-Receptor-Biology-and-Gene-Expression/daniel-r-larson). Download and install the open access virtual machine for the interactive data language (IDL) operating system which is required to run the Spot Finding and Tracking Program (http://www.spacewx.com/pdf/idlvm.pdf).  \nOpen the 32-bit, stitched image, which was generated in step 4.6 (Figure 4A), in the Spot Finding and Tracking Program. Select the Localize dropdown and click Localize (Figure 4B), which will calculate the number spots found in the image.\n\tNOTE: Each spot counted represents an individual mRNA. Band pass and photon threshold settings are shown in the screenshot (Figure 4B). For this protocol, default for each threshold setting was used. Representative positive and background spots are shown (Figure 4C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59414/59414fig4.jpg",
