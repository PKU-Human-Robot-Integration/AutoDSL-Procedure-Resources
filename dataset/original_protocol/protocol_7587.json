    "Cell preparation SW982 cells are regularly cultured in DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% P/S and incubated at 37 °C in humid conditions with 5% CO2. RASF cells were isolated from synovial tissues of the knee joints from four RA patients; Table 1 displays the specific information of patients. The procedures for RASF isolation are as follows; a simple flowchart for cell extraction is shown in Figure 1.Table 1.

Schematic diagram of synovial fibroblasts extraction process. Created with BioRender.com[href=https://www.biorender.com/].Cut off excess adipose tissue from the RA synovial tissue specimen, rinse the synovial tissue with sterile saline until there are no obvious blood stains, select suitable tissues, place it in a sterile culture dish, and use ophthalmic scissors to cut it as small as possible.Add 5 mL of saline, soak the tissues, and then transfer it into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 500× g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.Add 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for resuspension, type I collagenase (final concentration 1 mg/mL), hyaluronidase (final concentration 0.15 mg/mL), and DNase (final concentration 0.15 mg/mL). Mix them well, digest at 37 for 60–90 min, and shake the centrifuge tube occasionally.After tissues’ digestion, add 5 mL of culture medium and resuspend. Let it stand until the remaining tissue block in the 15 mL centrifuge tube settles at the bottom and transfer the supernatant to another 15 mL centrifuge tube for centrifugation to obtain cell pellets.Wash the pellets with 5 mL of culture medium, resuspend, centrifuge, and discard the supernatant. Add 4 mL of culture medium again and repeat the resuspension centrifugation step to collect as many cells as possible.Count the collected cells with a hemacytometer. Seed 4 million cells per 25 cm2 of the culture bottle. The newly isolated cells are highly diverse. In addition to RASF, there are lymphocytes, osteoclasts, macrophages, and macrophage-like synovial cells. Therefore, the abundant cell density at the very beginning is crucial for the growth of synovial cells.Place the culture flask inoculated with cells in a 5% CO2 cell incubator at 37 and observe the cell adhesion for any contamination on the next day.",
    "On the third day, change the fluid and discard the other types of cells or dead cells, which did not adhere to the bottom of the flask. Passage the cells when the confluence reaches 90%. Primary synovial fibroblasts in good condition are shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4823/bioprotoc-13-18-4823-g002.jpgFigure 2. The expected cell morphology of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblast primary cells. Scale bar: 1 μm.Cell seeding Wash thoroughly with PBS buffer three times. After discarding all the liquid, add 1 mL of trypsin, gently move the culture flask to make it even, and incubate it at 37 for approximately 2 min. Observe the cell condition and avoid excessive digestion, which may affect the cell morphology.Add 4 mL of complete culture medium to terminate the reaction, gently detach the cells from the bottom with a pipette, transfer the cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube, centrifuge at 1,000× g for 5 min to collect cell pellets, discard the supernatant, add 1 mL of the culture medium, and fully resuspend the cells.According to the required number of cells in the experiment, inoculate SW982 cells and RASF cell in a 6-well plate overnight and make sure they grow to 80% confluence.Preparation of the transfection reagents For each well in the 6-well plate, add 5 μL of LipofectamineTM 3000 reagent and mix well using a pipette in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 250 μL of serum-free DMEM medium. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Add miRNA mimics or inhibitors and mix them in another centrifuge tube containing 250 μL of serum-free DMEM medium. The sequence information of mimics and inhibitors is shown in Table 2.Table 2. MiRNA mimics and inhibitors sequence information table:",

Wash the cells in the 6-well plate with PBS and add 1.5 mL of serum-free culture medium. After the incubation of the transfection reagent, add 500 μL of the mixture from the previous step to each well, mix thoroughly, and incubate in a CO2 incubator. Forty-eight hours later, replace the medium with the complete SW982 and RASF cell culture medium.Troubleshooting The temperature of LipofectamineTM 3000 may affect transfection efficiency; therefore, when mixed with LipofectamineTM 3000, the culture medium should be kept at room temperature.The number and status of cells have an impact on transfection. Resuscitated cells and primary cells should be transmitted to at least the third generation, and the number of cells should be stable before use.After adding LipofectamineTM 3000 in the experimental steps, the mixing should be gentle to avoid damaging the liposome particles and affecting the transfection efficiency.The transfection effect depends on the cell state, concentration of transfectants, transfection reagents, operation of transfection processes, etc. Therefore, a pilot study for subsequent transfection efficiency verification is always needed to determine whether they are effective for each individual study. We are usually confident to validate the gain or loss of function for miRNAs and their target genes following transfection with the miRNA mimics or inhibitors for 48 h."
