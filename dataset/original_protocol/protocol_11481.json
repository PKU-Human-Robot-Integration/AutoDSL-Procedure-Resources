    "Animals used in the following protocol are covered by Oregon Health & Science University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which is designed to be compliant with the Animal Welfare Act regulations and Public Health Service (PHS) Policy.\nMaintenance of sterile conditions: Sterilized instruments should be used and between mice, should be wiped clean with sterile gauze, rinsed in PBS followed by sterilization with disinfectant 70% ethanol for at least 15 minutes. A surgical cap, facemask, gown, and gloves should be worn for survival surgeries. Pre-operative preparation of the animal for survival surgeries is included in the following protocol. Refer to Table 1 for a list of reagents and equipment.\n1. Isolation and Preparation of Single Cell Suspensions from Primary Mammary Tumors\nAnesthetize donor female 100 day old transgenic MMTV-PyMT (FVB/n) mice and maintain under continuous sedation by administering 2% isoflurane via an anesthesia mask. Confirm that the mouse is properly anesthetized with an absent foot pinch reflex.\nIn a sterile setting, resect primary mammary tumors from 100-day old transgenic female MMTV-PyMT (FVB/n) mice by separating mammary tumor from overlying skin and surrounding adipose tissue and/or lymph nodes using sterile scissors. Euthanize the anesthetized mice by cervical dislocation.\nWith sterile scissors or a scalpel, mince primary tumors manually into small pieces (~1.0 mm3). Place tumor pieces in 3.0 mg/mL collagenase A and 4.0 U/mL DNase I dissolved in DMEM. Use ~10 mL of the above digestion medium per 1.0 cm diameter tumor.\nPerform digestion in a sterile 25 mL bottle with a sterile stir bar at ~125 rpm and 37 °C for 40 min.\nStop the digestion by adding fetal bovine serum (FBS) to a final dilution of 10% and place the entire mixture on wet ice where it is maintained.",
    "Filter the digested tumor suspension through a 0.7 µm nylon strainer into a 50 mL conical tube and discard any tumor remaining in the strainer. Centrifuge the supernatant at 300 x g at 4 °C.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL DMEM per 1.0 cm tumor and re-filter through a 0.7 µm nylon strainer. Count cell concentration, then centrifuge at 300 x g at 4 °C.\nResuspend pellet in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide with 90% FBS at a concentration of 2 x 107 live cells/mL. Store single-cell suspensions of whole primary tumor at -80 °C.\n2. Orthotopic Injection of Mammary Tumor\nPartially thaw frozen primary tumor suspensions at 37 °C until the frozen pellet can be released from the cryogenic tube into 20 mL DMEM and count the cells. Centrifuge at 300 x g at 4 °C and resuspend cells in a 1:1 DMEM: growth factor-reduced solubilized basement membrane preparation extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma at a concentration of 1 x 107 cells/mL (see the Table of Materials).\nPlace the anesthetized recipient female syngeneic mouse ventral side up and maintain under continuous sedation by administering 2% isoflurane via an anesthesia mask.\nSterilize the right 4th mammary gland injection site using aerosolized 70% ethanol and applying Poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-Iodine with a sterile cotton swab.\nInject 100 µL (1 x 106 live cells from frozen primary tumor suspensions) bevel-side up into uncleared right 4th mammary gland of the 6 to 10 week-old female FVB/n mouse using a 29 G 0.3 mL insulin syringe.\n3. Surgical Resection of Orthotopic Mammary Tumor\n38-60 days following tumor cell injection, euthanize mice not exhibiting orthotopic tumor volumes ranging between 172 to 450 mm3 in volume [length x (width2)/2] (about 75% of injected mice).",
    "Place anesthetized mice displaying proper tumor size ventral side up under continuous sedation by administering 2% isoflurane via an anesthesia mask and confirm the mouse is properly anesthetized with an absent foot pinch reflex. Apply vet ointment to the eyes for prevention of dryness while under sedation.\nSpray 70% ethanol to sterilize the surgical area surrounding the primary tumor, then apply Poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-Iodine with a sterile cotton swab.\n\tNOTE: Hair removal at the surgical site resulted in skin excoriations and/or infections for ~5% mice and was therefore excluded from this step (data not shown).\nAs shown in Figure 1C, make an initial skin incision using blunt scissors medial-caudal to the tumor.\nNext, make a superior excision of the skin (Figure 1C) medial to the tumor. Pay attention to the need to cauterize any vasculature feeding the tumor located on the skin before extending the incision.\nContinue the skin incision laterally (posterior to the tumor), then make a superior skin excision (lateral to tumor), and medial excision (superior to tumor) (Figure 1C).\nAfter the skin has been excised circumferentially around the tumor (Figure 1C), lift overlying skin attached to the tumor using forceps while blunt dissecting the tumor away from the abdominal wall musculature and keeping the mammary glands intact.\nIdentify (by blunt dissection) and cauterize large vessels running through the 4th and 5th mammary glands.\nExcise approximately half of the 4th and 5th mammary glands at the cauterization site to free the tumor, overlying skin, and segments of the mammary glands (Figure 1C).\nIn the event of bleeding, identify actively bleeding vessels and immediately cauterize them. If more than 250 µL of blood is lost, exclude the mouse from study and euthanize it.\nClose excision sites with wound clips using a wound clip applier (Figure 1C).",
    "NOTE: Remove the wound clips 10 days post-surgery with a wound clip remover.\nAdminister warm sterile saline subcutaneously (4% of the animal's body weight) and keep the animal warm with a heat lamp. Check the animals every 5-10 min during recovery from anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: Administration of either bupivacaine or lidocaine increased post-operative mortality (data not shown). Mice that showed signs of pain (hunching, unwilling to move, failure to groom) 1 h after surgery were euthanized.\n\t\nOnce the mouse has fully recovered, return it to the company of other mice.\n4. Isolation and Processing of Blood and Lung for Flow Cytometry and Histology\nAt the study endpoints, prepare mice for various histopathologic assessments if desired. 90 min before euthanasia, give each mouse an intraperitoneal injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 µg/g mouse weight) at a concentration of 6.25 µg/µL in 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: Frozen stocks of dissolved bromodeoxyuridine are used within 1 month after preparation.\n10 min before euthanasia, with the mouse anesthetized, collect retroorbital blood (>500 µL) using heparinized capillary tubes, and subsequently transfer to tubes coated with dipotassium EDTA held on ice.\nTo remove lungs and remaining mammary tissue, make a midline incision with scissors from the lower abdomen to the mouth to expose the thoracic and peritoneal cavities (Figure 2A), and peel the skin laterally to also expose the remaining right 4th and 5th mammary glands.\nExcise the remaining mammary gland tissue and examine it to rule out primary tumor regrowth by assessing serial sectioned formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Supplementary Figure 1).\nTo remove lungs, open the abdominal wall to the diaphragm with scissors, then euthanize the animal by cutting the abdominal aorta to drain blood prior to perfusion of lungs (Figure 2B-2C).",
    "Cut the diaphragm along the rib cage from an abdominal approach making sure to avoid the lung and heart. Then, expose the thorax by cutting through the lateral sides of the rib cage (Figure 2D).\nUsing a 23-gauge needle on a 20 mL syringe, perfuse lungs with ~5.0 mL DPBS (~10 mL/min) through the right ventricle of the heart until the lungs turn entirely white (Figure 2E-2F). Immediately cut off the heart from the main vessels so blood does not re-perfuse into the lung.\nFor lung tissue to be fixed and processed for histopathologic assessments, inject ~1.0 mL 10% formalin at 4 °C into the exposed trachea bevel side up toward the lungs using a 23-gauge needle (Figure 2G-2H). Cease injection once lungs are completely expanded and filled with fixative (Figure 2I).\nExcise lung lobes from trachea, and emersion fix lung tissue in neutral-buffered formalin for subsequent paraffin embedding or OCT-freezing medium, per standard histopathologic procedures.\nQuantitatively evaluate metastatic burden in lungs by serial sectioning of FFPE lung tissue and evaluate microtome sections (100 µm, thirteen sections), by H&E staining (Figure 1B).\nSubscription Required.
