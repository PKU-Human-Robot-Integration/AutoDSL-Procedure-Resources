    "1. Equipment\nSoftware: use OECD QSAR Toolbox 4.0 or newer (free download from <https://qsartoolbox.org/download/?) and data analysis software.\nComputer: for the OECD QSAR Toolbox, use: (i) system type: 64 bit, Windows 7 or newer; (ii) processor: I5 at 2.4 GHz, or a faster processor or equivalent AMD CPU; (iii) installed memory (RAM): 6 GB; (iv) hard disk drive (HDD): 20 GB of free hard drive space (OECD QSAR Toolbox 4.3 Release Notes: <https://qsartoolbox.org/file/2019/02/Toolbox-4.3-Release-Notes-1.pdf>).\n2. Procedure\nOECD QSAR Toolbox\n\tNOTE: The QSAR Toolbox operates in six consecutive flow modules starting from Input and followed by Profiling, Data, Category Definition, Data Gap Filling, then Report, located at the top of the program interface.\n\t\nExplore the aforementioned six stages through six toolbar icons by left-clicking. First, look over the stages of Input, Data Gap Filling, and Report that are necessary to perform the automated workflow “Ecotoxicological endpoint” and to document its results.\nTake a short look over optional stages Profiling and Data. The Profiling stage provides an initial insight into the target substance’s (eco)toxicity potential and environmental fate characteristics. Optional Data stage enables searching for available experimental data related to the target substance.\nInput\n\t\nUpon starting the QSAR Toolbox, the user begins at the Input toolbox stage by default. The QSAR Toolbox creates a working file named “Document 1” automatically, which is displayed in the stage option panel on the left of the program interface. Rename the file, if desired, by right-clicking the working file.\nClick on the CAS# button in the actions toolbar, enter the chemical abstract service (CAS) number of the target substance in the available text field, and click Search. The tool will then search for the target substance by CAS number.",
    "If required, choose other search options that are available in the action toolbar such as searching by substance name or simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) code. SMILES can be entered as 2D non-stereochemical or 3D stereochemical containing forms. Click Name or Structure, respectively. Use the Structure tool to draw the target substance.\nThe search tool displays the search results through database records in a pop-up window. Choose the record reporting a “high” CAS-SMILES relation (CS Relation field) if multiple records are retrieved for the target substance by checking the box on the left of the record. Click OK.\n\t\tNOTE: Proceeding from this point is possible only if the retrieved record contains a SMILES code, as the SMILES code (2D non-stereochemical containing form) is the basis for computation.\nBatch mode: to perform the in silico assay for multiple target substances, write a simple substance list in a text editor in which each CAS number is listed in a single row (Supplementary Figure S3). Save the text file with an appropriate name and extension .txt on the computer.\nBatch mode: click Data. Then, go to Databases in the stage option panel on the left of the program interface. Make sure databases that are listed under Ecotoxicological Information are checked.\nBatch mode: click Input. Select Query from the actions toolbar. Accept the settings set in step 2.2.6 by clicking Yes in the dialog window.\nBatch mode: choose the CAS tab. Upload the substance list saved as text file through Load list from your computer.\nBatch mode: there are two Add buttons available; click the Add button on the bottom of the pop-up menu and then click Execute. The QSAR Toolbox will display a message on the number of substances that have been retrieved for the search.",
    "NOTE: Some substances of the loaded list may not be found by the search tool or that several entries may be available for one CAS number. It is not possible to delete substances from the retrieved set of substances.\nProfiling\n\tNOTE: The following section is optional. If this is not required, skip to section 2.5.\n\t\nClick on the toolbox stage button Profiling. Go to Profiling methods in the stage option panel on the left of the program interface.\nClick Unselect All. Check all profilers listed under Predefined and those related to aquatic toxicity listed under Endpoint specific such as “Acute aquatic toxicity classification by Verhaar (Modified).”\nFinish the selection. Then click on the Apply button in the Actions toolbar.",
    "NOTE: The QSAR Toolbox provides recommendations on a set of profilers. These are highlighted in green (suitable) and orange (plausible) when choosing Options > Color by: > Endpoint selected in the data matrix in the upper left corner of Profiling methods. Left-click the data matrix field next to the endpoint of interest. Available endpoints are listed in the endpoint tree next to the stage option panel. The profiler Substance type will indicate whether the target substance is a “discrete chemical.” The information is displayed in the expanded endpoint tree “Profile”, “Predefined”, and “Substance type”. Only if the target substance is a discrete chemical can the automated workflow run successfully. “Acute aquatic toxicity classification by Verhaar (modified)” provides a first estimate of the acute aquatic toxicity mechanism of the target substance19,20. The information is displayed in the expanded endpoint tree “Profile”, “Endpoint Specific”, and “Acute aquatic toxicity classification by Verhaar (modified)”. Five classes are available: (class 1) inert chemicals (baseline toxicity); (class 2) less inert chemicals; (class 3) reactive chemicals; (class 4) specifically acting chemicals; and (class 5) for chemicals not possible to classify.\nRight-click Parameter in the endpoint tree to run integrated 2D and 3D QSAR models available in the QSAR Toolbox, if desired. Click Calculate/extract all parameters for all chemicals in the pop-up menu.\n2D and 3D QSAR models compiled in Parameter provide numeric values. Use “Profiling methods” for qualitative information (see step 2.3.1).\nData\n\tNOTE: This section is optional. If it is not required, skip to section 2.5.\n\t\nClick on the toolbox stage button Data. Then, click Gather from the Actions toolbar.\nSelect All endpoints to gather all experimental data, then Choose to gather endpoint specific experimental data. As an example, if aquatic toxicity is the user’s focus, click Choose > Ecotoxicological Information > Aquatic toxicity > OK.",
    "NOTE: Choosing to gather experimental data for all endpoints may lead to extended processing time. The user can adapt the hierarchy of the endpoint tree to the specific purpose. This changes the manner in which data are displayed.\nIf desired, right-click the endpoint of interest in the endpoint tree area. Choose Set tree hierarchy in the pop-up menu. Organize the endpoint tree in the preferred manner using the available terms and arrows and click OK.\nIf desired, export the gathered data as an Excel file. Right-click on the endpoint of interest and choose Export Data matrix in the pop-up menu.\nA “Matrix export” wizard opens and enables adding other endpoints to the export list. Finish the selection, click Export, and save the file on the computer.\n\t\tNOTE: Exporting data from all databases is not possible. For example, data retrieved from the database “ECHA CHEM” cannot be saved.\nData gap filling\n\t\nClick on the toolbox stage button Data gap filling. Then, click Automated in the Actions toolbar.\nSelect Ecotoxicological Endpoint > Fish, LC50 (lethal concentration, 50%) at 96 h for Pimephales promelas (mortality). Click OK. A “Workflow Controller” will appear, and processing will take up to several minutes, especially in batch mode.\n\t\tNOTE: The QSAR Toolbox automatically applies a defined set of profilers when searching for suitable substances with available experimental data for the prediction. The experimental data [e.g., effect concentrations 96 h LC50 (P. promelas) or 96 h EC50 (P. promelas, mortality)] are used to generate the prediction for the target substance by either linear approximation or nearest neighbor method. Note that the methods of linear approximation and nearest neighbor are referred to as trend analysis (labeled as “T”) and read-across (labeled as “R”), respectively.",
    "The user will receive a message if the prediction is performed successfully. Click OK and close the workflow controller indicating “Finished workflow” by clicking x in the upper right corner.\nBatch mode: upon starting the automated workflow, the user will be asked to specify the range of substances over which to execute the workflow. Accept the full range of substances selected by default in the dialog window by clicking OK.\nBatch mode: the user will not receive a message indicating whether a prediction was run successfully or unsuccessfully. Close the workflow controller indicating “Finished workflow” at the end of the batch processing by clicking x in the upper right corner.\nReport\n\t\nIf a prediction was successfully executed, click on the toolbox stage button Report.\n\t\tNOTE: No reports can be generated in batch mode.\nScroll down and find the prediction value in matrix field located in a yellow highlighted row next to endpoint “96-h.” The predicted value is labelled with “T” or “R.” Activate this specific data matrix field by left-clicking it.\nClick Prediction in the Actions toolbar. Customize the report content and appearance in the pop-up wizard. Three types of reports are available: (i) prediction, (ii) category, and (iii) data matrix.\nThe wizard allows the user to fill in the author’s name and contact details. Write a short summary, provide a detailed explanation of the mechanistic interpretation, or provide justification for the adequacy of the prediction.\nInclude additional information related to the executed prediction, if desired. The extent of additional information depends on the user.\nGo through the wizard by clicking Next. Finally, click Create report and save the prediction and category reports as PDF files and the data matrix as an Excel spreadsheet on the computer.",
    "Find additional details on the functionalities of the QSAR Toolbox and automated workflows in the application manual for the OECD QSAR Toolbox v.4 (F1 help on the keyboard). Details on the algorithms and rationale behind the automated workflow are described by Dimitrov et al.8 and Yordanova et al.9.\n3. Application\nIf using the predicted effect concentration (i.e., 96-h LC50 of P. promelas) in the environmental risk assessment, use the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval. Find the data on the first page of the saved prediction report (PDF) in “Prediction summary”, “Predicted value: <mean> (from <lower_limit> to <upper_limit>).”\n\tNOTE: The notes given here are based on results of the comparison between predicted and experimental data for a set of target substances reported in this study. Selecting the lower end of the 95% confidence range will increase the likelihood that the predicted effect concentration will not underestimate the real toxicity of the substance (see the representative results). The predicted effective concentration of the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval will therefore present a safer basis for risk assessment."
