    "1. Chip fabrication\nThe process described in 6 results in a 3 μm thick self-standing film, a low 1 Mohm access resistance and a smooth-surfaced funnel shaped aperture that facilitates an intimate seal with the cell 9, see Figure 2. The chips are singulated and glued in Plexiglas packages with the aperture facing a hole connecting the chip to a subterranean channel. The gluing is dispensed in a way that minimizes the shunt capacitance to a nominal 17 pF. Packages are fitted with two 1.5 mm diameter and 6 mm long glass tubes as fluidic ports (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3288/3288fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Scanning electron micrograph of a focused ion beam section of an NRCC patch-clamp chip shows a smooth silicon dioxide surface and funnel shape that favors intimate cell contacts, and a shallow orifice that accounts for a low access resistance.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3288/3288fig2.jpg\nFigure 3. A chip is glued at the bottom of the culture vial in a Plexiglas package fitted with subterranean fluidics and glass tubes.\n2. Sterilization, priming and testing\nThe following steps should be performed in a biology safety cabinet to avoid contamination or plugging of the aperture.\nSterilize chips in a Harrick basic plasma cleaner (www.harrickplasma.com) with a 0.1-0.3 mbar residual air pressure for 15 min at the maximum power of 18 W. Other air plasma systems may be used, with comparable power density (24 mW/cm3) and keeping the product of power density and time constant. The plasma treatment also renders the chips hydrophilic, which facilitates priming.\nFit glass tubes with sterile Silastic Laboratory silicone tubing, 1mm I.D. x 2mm O.D. (Cole Parmer Cat. # 96115-08), 3inch on one side, 1 inch on the other side.\nFill fluidics through the tubes with sterile filtered standard Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS), making sure no bubble is trapped.",
    "Clip the long silicone tube while pressurizing the PBS from the short side at 1 atm. A pool of PBS seeping through the aperture might be visible in the vial. Clip the pressurized supply of the PBS and detach the short silicone tube from that supply.\nFill vial with filtered PBS using a syringe.\nImmerse an Ag/Ag:Cl electrode in the short tube and a counter-electrode in the vial. An impedance meter is used to confirm that the access resistance is between 300kohm and 3Mohm and the shunt capacitance is between 10pF and 25pF. A chip with a lower resistance is likely to have a leak, and a higher capacitance is considered improper for use as it may not capture the fastest dynamics of the cell′s electrophysiology 6. A chip with a lower capacitance or higher resistance is considered plugged, though it could be simply that a bubble is trapped in the orifice. Some chips are re-tested after 1H and found to have the correct electrochemical impedance.\nFlush the fluidic channel with sterile deionized water; empty the top vial and rinse with the same, twice.\nImmerse the packaged chip with tubes in fresh sterile deionized water for 30min then load with other chips in a sterile container filled with sterile deionized water. This ensures that chips remain hydrophilic and protected from contamination.\n3. Chips preparation in cell biology lab\nThe following steps are performed in a HEPA filtered laminar flow hood using aseptic techniques, all solutions used in this procedure must be filtered sterilized prior to use using a 0.22μm filter.\nOpen a chip container under a HEPA filtered laminar flow hood and remove chips from container face down to avoid scooping possible floating contaminants into top vial.",
    "Rinse top of vial of chip 2x with freshly filtered sterile deionized water to remove any residual debris from the chip surface.\nAspirate sterile deionized water off the top vial.\nConnect one end of the silastic tubing attached to the fluidic channel to a pressurized syringe containing sterile filtered deionized water. In our system, syringes filled with solution are pressurized by connection to a compressed air tank set to 20psi. To ensure sterility, the air is filtered (0.22 μm filter) prior to entry into the syringe and our system also has an on/off valve that allows us to stop or apply pressure when needed.\nUsing a hemostat, clamp the output end of the tubing.\nOpen the on/off valves to pressurize the solution.\nTo rinse the subterranen fluidic of the chip with fresh sterile deionized water, unclamp the output end of the tubing.\nTo force the water up through the aperture, clamp the output end of the tubing with a hemostat.\nTo avoid water drainage, clamp the input and output ends of the tubing with an hemostats and close the on/off valves.\nDetach the input end of the tubing from the syringe.\nInsert glass plugs into both ends of the tubing and remove the hemostats.\nFill top vial with filter steriled deionized water.\nPlace the lid of a 35 mm sterile dish into the base of a 100 mm sterile dish\nPlace chip on top of the 35 mm lid and cover with 100 mm dish lid.\nImage chips to ensure that the membrane and aperture of the chips are free of debris and/or air bubbles. In our lab we use an upright microscope and a 20x long working distance objective.",
    "If debris and/or air bubbles are present, repeatedly flush fluidic channel and top vial. If the debris and/or air bubbles cannot be removed the chip is discarded.\nOnce the chips are imaged, return to laminar flow hood and unplug both ends of the tubing.\nAttach one end of the tubing to a pressurized syringe containing physiological media.\nClamp the output end of the tubing with a hemostat\nOpen pressure valve, remove the hemostat from the output end of the fluidics and flush the fluidic channel with physiological media\nTo rinse the subterranean fluidic with physiological media, open the on/off valves and remove the hemostat from the output end of the tubing.\nTo force the physiological media up through the aperture, clamp the output end of the tubing with a hemostat.\nClamp input end of the tubing with a hemostat and close the on/off valves.\nRemove the input end of the tubing from the syringe and plug both ends of the tubing with glas plugs.\nRemove the hemostats.\nRemove the water from the top vial.\nFill the top vial with filter sterilized physiological media.\nPlace the chip back into the 100 mm Petri dish.\nPlace the base of a 35 mm dish into the 100 mm dish and fill it with filter sterilized deionized water to enrich humidity.\nCover the dish until it is time for plating\n4. Cell plating of snail neurons",
    "The patch-clamp chips may be suitable for a variety of preparations. We are currently testing our chips with mammalian primary cortical neurons and have obtained preliminary results with cells cultured for 14 days 7, which indicates that our sterilization protocol is adequate and that the chips are not cytotoxic in long-term cultures. For the purpose of this protocol, snail neurons were chosen because they represent a simple but well-established model to study neuronal electrophysiology 11, and it is with those cells that we have obtained the most significant results to date 10. Detailed cell isolation and culture procedures have been described previously 12, 13.\nRemove the outer shell from 2-3 month old Lymnaea stagnalis with blunt forceps and anesthetize animals in Lymnaea saline containing 10% Listerine.All subsequent steps performed aseptically within a laminar airflow hood with sterilized dissection equipment and solutions at room temperature.\nReplace physiological media in the fluidics with the appropriate recording solutionusing an Eppendorf pipette. In the case of Lymnaea neurons the solution contains (in mM): 50 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 5 ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and 5 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; pH 7.4; 130 mOsm)14\nPin the snails into a Sylgard dish filled with Lymnaea saline and remove entire brain as previously described 13\nTreat the isolated brains in defined media (DM) with trypsin enzyme (0.2% Solution, Sigma, Catalog # T-9201) for 18 minutes followed by treatment in DM and trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, Soybean, Catalog # T-9003) for 15 minutes.\nPin the brains into a small Sylgard dish filled with high osmolarity defined media (HODM - DM with glucose added; 750 μL of 1M glucose solution to 20 mL DM).\nUsing fine forceps and dissection scissors, remove the outer and inner sheath of the ganglia of interest, exposing the neurons.",
    "Using a fire polished glass pipette filled with HODM and attached to a microsyringe, apply gentle suction near the cell of interest (Left pedal dorsal 1) until the neuron detaches from the brain and is suspended in the pipette.\nThe glass pipette is then moved and dipped into individual neurochips where gentle expulsion from the microsyringe allows the neurons to be gently pushed out of the pipette and placed on top of the individual patch holes on the chips.\nAllow cells to sit undisturbed for a minimum of 2h at room temperature to promote their attachment to the chip surface surrounding the aperture.\n5. Electrophysiological recordings\nTo connect the chips to the amplifier (in our case a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA, USA)\nReplace the solution in the subterranean fluidic and in the chip vial with the appropriate recording solutions. In the case of Lymnaea neurons , the upper culture chambers are filled with Lymnaea saline (in mM: 51.3 NaCl, 1.7 KCl, 4 CaCl2, and 1.5 MgCl2) buffered to pH 7.9 with HEPES.14\nFor stability, glue the chip onto a glass slide and place it under a microscope.\nTo connect the chip to the amplifier (in our case a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA, USA), cut one end of the tubing and insert a silver wire which is connected to the head-stage.\nPlace the reference electrode in the top vial of the chip.\nThe chip is now ready for recording.",
    "Apply a 5 mV step with the amplifier to measure total resistance (Rt) and determine the configuration of the neurons: cell-attached (Rt > 1 GΩ); whole-cell (Rt = 50-100 MΩ plus capacitive transients, indicative of membrane rupture over the aperture); or no seal (Rt < 5 MΩ). In our last set of experiments 10, 58% percent of cells had high-resistance seals and, of those, 80% of cells showed excitable responses.\n6. Representative Results\nApply depolarizing current pulses (20 pA increment) to the neuron (in this case LPeD1).\nHold the neuron at Vm close to its resting potential (~ - 60 mV).\nObserve the responses to these depolarizing pulses. Overshooting action potentials should be observed if the neuron is viable.\nFigure 4 shows a representative result which is discussed in details in 14, 15.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3288/3288fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Voltage responses (top) of a LPeD1 neuron to graded series of intracellular current pulses (below). The current pulses were applied at Vm = - 60mV.\nTroubleshooting\nBefore plating, image chips to determine if membrane and aperture are free of debris and suitable for plating. We use an upright microscope and a 20x long working distance objective. In our last set of experiments 1, 67% percent of chips were successfully primed in that manner.\nIf debris and/or air bubbles are present discard chip and try another one.\nVarious surface treatments (plasma) or coatings (PDL, PEI etc.) may be tried, but success may be highly dependent upon cell type used.\nThe composition of the fluidic (\"pipette\") solution in critical for the formation of the giga-seal and the whole-cell. Adjust solution, paying attention to osmolarity, pH, and ionic makeup.\nFor longer term culture, begin with media in microfluidic channel, then switch to pipette solution prior to recording via gentle gravity fed perfusion (~0.5 ml/min)."
