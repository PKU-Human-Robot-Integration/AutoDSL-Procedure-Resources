    "This study protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Istanbul University, Faculty of Medicine, ensuring adherence to ethical guidelines and patient safety. Additionally, prior to their participation in the study, informed consent was obtained from all patients.\n1. Preoperative procedures\nPerform the surgery under general anesthesia, adhering to the institutionally approved protocol for anesthetization. Set the endoscope, optic instruments, and C-arm devices in the operating room (see Table of Materials).\nCheck the tools before starting the procedure.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: The necessary tools are: the dilator, beveled working sleeve, an endoscope with 20 degrees angle and 177 mm length with a 9.3 diameter oval shaft with a 5.6 mm diameter working channel, rongeur 3-4 mm, Kerrison punch 5.5 mm, punch 5.4 mm, burr round, fluid control irrigation and suction pump device, tip control radioablator applying a radiofrequency current of 4 MHz, 5.5 mm oval burr with lateral protection, and the diamond round (see Table of Materials).\n2. Surgical technique\nPlace the patient in a prone position with thorax and pelvis support pillows. One surgeon can perform the surgery, but an assistant would ease the procedure.\nPlace the C- arm and obtain a lateral X-ray view to mark the posterior line of the facet. Obtain the anteroposterior (AP) view to mark the middle of the intervertebral disc space where the discectomy is intended.\n\tNOTE: While obtaining the X-rays, ensure the end plates are parallel. The endplates are parallel when there is no double contour in the scan and only a superimposed single line.\nPerform a 1 cm skin incision by an 11-blade at the intersection of the lines.",
    "Place the 10-inch long 18 G spinal needle under the AP X-ray view until the medial border of the pedicle. Check the lateral X-ray view to be in the inferior border of the intervertebral foramen and dorsal and caudal to the dorsal border of the annulus fibrosis.\nPlace the guide wire inside the spinal needle. Remove the spinal needle, and then introduce the dilator over the guide wire. While introducing the dilator, ensure its direction is the same as the guide wire.\nObtain AP X-ray views while advancing the dilator for safe entry. Remove the guide wire when the dilator is in the foramen's caudal part and the pedicle's medial border in the AP view. Check the lateral view, so the dilator is dorsal to the annulus and not in the disc space.\nIntroduce the beveled working sleeve over the dilator. Ensure that the handle of the beveled working sleeve is on the same side as the long edge of the instrument's tip.\n\t\nWhen introducing the working sleeve, ensure the handle is in the dorsal aspect to protect the exiting nerve root. When the working sleeve is in place, rotate the working sleeve 180 degrees from the caudal side.\n\t\tNOTE: Rotation from the caudal side is again to protect the exiting nerve root since the nerve root is superior to the working sleeve. On the inferior side is the caudal pedicle, which is the safer place to rotate the long edge of the beveled working sleeve.\nRemove the dilator, and introduce the endoscope through the working sleeve.\nVisualize the annulus fibrosis, posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL), and epidural fat tissue. Do not enter the spinal canal since the pathology is not there.",
    "Coagulate bleeding to have clear visualization throughout the procedure. Here, one will see the ascending facet in the dorsal part, and in the inferior part, one will see the caudal pedicle.\nRotate the working sleeve and the endoscope to the cranial aspect. This maneuver allows for a clear view of the vessels, fat tissue, and ligaments within the intervertebral foramen. Utilize the bipolar radioablator to coagulate these structures, and subsequently, remove them with the 3 mm rongeur.\nAfter removing the soft tissues, ensure that the disc fragment becomes visible, positioned superior to the annulus defect. Above the disc material, the exiting nerve root can be observed, which is being compressed by the disc fragment.\nRemove the disc fragment with the Kerrison punch and the rongeur. The disc fragment can appear larger during the surgery than it appears in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to compression in a confined area. However, upon removal of the disc material, the nerve root is effectively decompressed.\n\tNOTE: If bony stenosis exists in the intervertebral foramen, bone removal can be achieved by a 5.5 mm oval burr with lateral protection, burr round, or diamond round.\nEvacuate the disc space by using the existent annulus defect by rongeur. Especially for high intervertebral disc space, the evacuation of the disc space is recommended to prevent recurrent disc herniation.\nSeal the evacuated area and the annulus defect margins by coagulation to prevent recurrence.\nAfter hemostasis, complete the procedure by removing the endoscopic system. Use a single 3-0 suture for closure; no drainage is necessary.\n3. Postoperative procedures and follow-up\nAsk the patients to begin oral intake in 6 h postoperatively. Mobilize the patients on the next day of the operation.",
    "NOTE: Postoperative pain levels are minimal, eliminating the necessity for prolonged painkiller usage. To address any discomfort at the operation site, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be administered.\nDo not recommend physical therapy and rehabilitation or a lumbar corset.\nIf the patient's symptoms have resolved after the surgery, do not perform a postoperative MRI.\nRemove the suture in the first week of operation.\nRecommend the patients to be admitted to the outpatient clinic in the first and fourth weeks of operation.\nSubscription Required.
