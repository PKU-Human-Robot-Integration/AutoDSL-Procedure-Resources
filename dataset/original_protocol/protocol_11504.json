    "1. Synthesis of Aspirin-fumarate Prodrug GTCpFE\nUsing a plastic plunger syringe, measure 0.81 ml (20 mmol) of methanol and mix it in water (10 ml) in a round bottom flask. Cool the resulting mixture to 0 °C by placing the flask in an ice-water bath. Add 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (2.48 mg, 20 mmol) and stir the reaction mixture until the solution is clear.\nPrepare a solution of O-acetylsalicyloyl chloride (3.77 mg, 19 mmol) in anhydrous toluene (10 ml) by weighing the desired amount of O-acetylsalicyloyl chloride and dissolving it in the solvent in a separate flask. Using a plastic plunger syringe, add this solution to the mixture prepared in step 1.1, and leave the reaction stirring at 0 °C.\nMonitor the reaction using thin layer chromatography (TLC). The TLC plates should have silica as a stationary phase.\n\t\nPrepare a mobile phase composed of 20:80 ethyl acetate (AcOEt)/hexane. In a TLC chamber (or small container) add 5 ml of mobile phase to cover the bottom of the chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of mobile phase depends on the chamber selected. Always add enough to cover the bottom, but once the TLC is placed inside, the solvent line should not surpass the height where the compounds are spotted.\nTake a sample of the reaction with a syringe (0.2 ml), place it in a small vial, and dilute it with ethyl acetate (2-3 drops). With a TLC spotter, carefully take a sample of the diluted reaction mixture and spot it in the TLC.\n\t\tNOTE: The spots should be 1-2 mm and this should be done at the lower 1/4 inch of the TLC plate.",
    "On the same TLC, place a spot of a solution of O-acetylsalicyloyl chloride (0.2 mg in 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate) as a comparison. Once the spots are dry, place it in the chamber and let it run until the solvent front has almost reached the top of the TLC.\nTake the TLC out, let it dry and visualize it under a UV lamp. The reaction is complete when the O-acetylsalicyloyl chloride spot disappears from the reaction mixture.\nWhen the reaction is completed, remove the ice-water bath, and allow the reaction to stir at room temperature for 20 hr.\nFilter the precipitate using a Buchner funnel with a fritted disk of medium porosity. Place the solid in a scintillation vial, and leave the compound in vacuo overnight in a desiccator at room temperature. Use phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) as the desiccant.\nDry a round bottom flask by placing it in an oven at 80 °C for at least two days before setting up this reaction. Alternatively, seal the flask with a septum and pierce it with a needle that is connected to a vacuum pump system. Turn the vacuum pump on and dry the flask using a heat gun. Allow to cool, and repeat this step 2 more times.\nInflate a balloon using argon gas, and connect it to a plastic syringe (whose plunger has been removed) with a needle. Turn off the vacuum pump and remove the needle attached to it that was inserted in the now dried round bottom flask. Insert the needle connected to the argon balloon through the septum sealing the round bottom flask.",
    "Add 4-hydroxymethylphenol ester of 2-acetyloxybenzoic acid (100 mg, 0.349 mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (4 mg, 0.033 mmol) and triethylamine (53 mg, 0.523 mmol) to a separate flask, then dissolved them in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 ml). With a plastic syringe attached to a needle, add this solution to the sealed round bottom flask. Cool the mixture down to 0 °C by placing the flask in an ice water bath.\nTo the previous mixture, add a solution of ethyl fumaroyl chloride (68 mg, 0.419 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 ml), drop-wise over a period of 10 min. Stir the resulting solution at 0-5 °C for 2-4 hr.\nExtract the reaction mixture with ethyl acetate (100 ml) and brine (50 ml).\n\tNOTE: Brine is a saturated solution of sodium chloride (NaCl). To prepare it, place 200 ml of water in a clean glass container then start adding NaCl (while stirring) until it doesn't dissolve anymore.\n\t\nAfter extraction, remove the aqueous phase and repeat the latter step two more times.\nDry the mixture by adding sodium sulfate to the organic phase, until the solid does not clump up when the glassware is stirred. Using another Buchner funnel with a fritted disk, filter the mixture to a round bottom flask to remove the sodium sulfate, then evaporate to dryness using a rotary evaporator with the temperature set at 40 °C.\nUsing a TLC, determine a proper mobile phase to use in column chromatography.\n\tNOTE: For this experiment a gradient of 20:80 AcOEt/hexane was used.\nPrepare a column with silica gel and the appropriate solvent phase. Once the compound has been added, add a layer of sodium sulfate (or sand) to protect the column as the solvent is added.",
    "As the column runs, monitor the eluate by TLC. Spot every other test tube as they are collected from the column. When the product of interest elutes, mix all samples containing pure product into a large round bottom flask, and dry them using a rotary evaporator with the bath temperature set at 40 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Product should appear as a white solid.\nTo confirm the structure of GTCpFE, collect proton and carbon (1H and 13C, respectively) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra as per manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: In this study a 400 MHz FT NMR spectrometer was used to collect the 1H and 13C spectra. Run at least 25 scans at room temperature to obtain enough data resolution.
