    "The authors come from two Danish TBLC centers (Odense University Hospital and Aarhus University Hospital) that both conduct research in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethics approval was not necessary as the study was observational in nature. All patients included for research purposes gave written informed consent. It is important to emphasize that the described stepwise approach for TBLC conductance relates to the use of a flexible bronchoscope and is based on a combination of recommendations from international guidelines, expert statements, state-of-art reviews, and experiences from the two TBLC centers9,10,11,15,16,17,22,23,24,25.\n1. PreTBLC considerations\nEnsure that TBLC is indicated, which is justified in patients in whom integration of information from HRCT, biochemistry, and autoimmunology in a preceding MDD involving pulmonologists and radiologists has not been able to establish a confident ILD diagnosis.\nSelect appropriate patients by avoiding the contraindications described in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nRelative contraindications,Absolute contraindications\nForced vital capacity (FVC) < 50% of predicted value,Thrombocytopenia < 50 x 109/L or INR > 1.5\nDiffusion capacity for carbon monoxide for the lung (DLCO) < 35% of predicted value,Uncorrected bleeding diathesis\n\"Systolic pulmonary arterial pressure > 50 mmHg (e.g., estimation based on an echocardiography)\",Progressive and clinical decline due to an increased risk of complications in patients with compromised pulmonary function\nBody mass index > 35 kg/m2,Progressive and clinical decline due to an increased risk of complications in patients with compromised pulmonary function\nTable 1: Contraindications for TBLC. Relative and absolute contraindications for TBLC conductance. Abbreviation: TBLC = transbronchial lung cryobiopsy.\n2. PreTBLC preparation\nReview the HRCT and suggestions from the thoracic radiologist to plan from which bronchial segments (BS) histological sampling is best accessible according to radiological disease manifestation.\nTest that the system works prior to TBLC performance.",
    "Press the gas (carbon dioxide (CO2) or the nitrous oxide (NO)) tank capacity button on the settings panel to check the volume of the gas in the cylinder.\nPlace the cryoprobe on a tray and observe the probe while pressing the pedal footswitch for 5-10 s. Look for an ice ball at the tip of the probe that will indicate it is functioning properly (Figure 1).\nUse general anesthesia (GA) or deep sedation under TBLC and consider premedication with tranexamic acid of 0.5-1 g to reduce the risk of bleeding.\nPlace a special double luminal endotracheal tube (ETT) of 7.5-8.5 mm size in the trachea.\n\t​NOTE: The ETT has a main channel that allows access for the bronchoscope while the patient is ventilated and has a minor side channel that serves as a working channel for the bronchial blocker catheter.\n\t\nSpray continuously with local anesthesia (e.g., lidocaine spray 10%) to reduce cough. See also step 3.5.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65753/65753fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: An ice ball as an indication of usable TBLC equipment. A pedal activates CO2 gas diffusion from the tank and induced freezing. This is tested in water where an ice ball will appear at the tip of the cryoprobe if functioning properly.

TBLC conductance\nIntroduce a flexible bronchoscope through the ETT and perform the bronchoscopy procedure.\n\tNOTE: A rigid bronchoscope is used in some TBLC centers to intubate the trachea. If the trachea is intubated by a rigid bronchoscope, a flexible bronchoscope can be passed through the rigid one.\n\t\nIntroduce the flexible cryoprobe through the working channel of the bronchoscope and into the selected BS.",
    "​NOTE: The cryoprobes occur as both single-use probes (1.1, 1.7, and 2.4 mm) and reusable probes (1.9 and 2.4 mm).\nUse fluoroscopy to ensure that the placement of the tip of the cryoprobe is approximately 10 mm from the thorax wall corresponding to the selected BS (Figure 2).\nIntroduce a bronchial blocker catheter (e.g., a Fogarty balloon) in the side channel of the double luminal ETT and place it at the selected BS ostium (Figure 3).\n\t\t\nInflate the bronchial blocker catheter to evaluate the appropriateness of placement and blockage for potential bleeding occurring distally with respect to the balloon (Figure 4).\nDeflate the bronchial blocker catheter if the balloon is well placed.\nSecure the placement of the balloon by fixing the bronchial blocker catheter with a pean.\nUse small amounts of lidocaine spray or saline in the respective ETT and its side channel to reduce any friction experienced due to the introduction of the cryoprobe in the ETT and the balloon catheter in the ETT's side channel.\nWhen steps 3.1.1-3.1.3 are satisfactorily performed, step on the freezing pedal for 3-6 s, depending on the cryoprobe size, to exploit the Joule-Thompsons law to freeze the lung parenchymal tissue to approximately -45-79 °C for CO2 and -89 °C for NO.\nRetract the flexible bronchoscope containing the cryoprobe in one quick movement while holding the freezing pedal down to continue freezing and prevent the biopsy from falling off during the retraction.\nDuring the maneuver described in step 3.1.5, have a person other than the bronchoscopist keep the balloon inflated to block the biopsy site distal of the selected BS ostium to control for potential bleeding.\nContinue step 3.1.6 until at least two biopsies from two BS from the same lobe are obtained.",
    "Place the biopsies in saline, and when all biopsies are obtained, fix them in formaldehyde (4%) (Figure 5).\nSend the biopsies for pathological examination prior to MDD.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65753/65753fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy is used to ensure correct placement of the cryoprobe before freezing. The tip of the cryoprobe appears as the head of a drumstick (black arrowhead).

PostTBLC procedures\nAfter each biopsy, reintroduce the bronchoscope into the BS and deflate the balloon to observe whether bleeding occurs.\n\t\nReinflate the balloon if bleeding is observed (Figure 6). If the balloon is in the proper position and blocks the BS, wait for a few minutes for the bleeding to stop, and then, continue the TBLC procedure.\nIf bleeding is still observed after step 4.1.1., install ice-cold saline distally to the balloon.\nIn case of ongoing bleeding after step 4.1.2. or balloon failure where blood spills into other BSs, use a combination of suction, endobronchially administered ice-cold saline with or without adrenalin, and tranexamic acid.",
    "If the coagulated blood blocks the airways, use the cryoprobe to open up the airway again by freezing the tip of the cryoprobe into the blood clot and retracting it up through the ETT.\nIf the bleeding remains uncontrolled, change the ETT to one that allows both ventilation of the non-biopsied lung and blockage of the main bronchus on the bleeding lung, and transfer the patient to an intensive care unit.\nPerform a focused lung ultrasound (FLUS) after TBLC, while the patient is still sedated to identify the indicatives of an iatrogenic pneumothorax (PTX).\n\t\nConsider insertion of a FLUS-guided pleural drain with a pigtail catheter (Fr 7-16) if FLUS observations indicate a high probability of PTX. Pleural drainage is indicated if FLUS indicates a rapidly increasing size of PTX, and especially if the clinical state of the patient is deteriorating.\nPostpone extubation by 5-10 min if FLUS reveals a small PTX and the patient is clinically stable. If the PTX size progresses hereafter or the patient becomes clinically unstable, insert a pleural drain prior to extubation.\nExtubate the patient after step 4.2 or step 4.2.2 if there is no indication of PTX or progress of the PTX size and the patient remains clinically stable.\nObserve the patient in a recovery room after TBLC. Just before the clinically stable patient goes home, ensure that late-onset PTX is not present by either repeated FLUS or a chest X-ray.\nDiscuss the presentation of the histological characteristics of the biopsies at a following MDD with pulmonologists, radiologists, and pathologists in conjunction with other details to conclude an ILD subtype with high diagnostic probability.\nInform the patient of the MDD conclusion from step 4.5 in the outpatient clinic, and plan potential treatment and follow-up.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65753/65753fig06.jpg",
