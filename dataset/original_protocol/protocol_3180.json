    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nTissue Clearing with CUBIC Reagents\nTiming: 3–14 days\nThis step describes how to prepare mouse samples and how to clear the organs.\nSacrifice tumor-bearing mice by overdose of pentobarbital (> 100 mg/kg) or isoflurane.\nPerfuse PBS and PFA.\nMake an incision in the right atrial appendage of heart.\nPerfuse 20–25 mL PBS via left ventricle of the heart using syringe with 23G needle.\nAfter PBS perfusion, change solution from PBS to 4% PFA by a three-way cock.\nPerfuse 20–25 mL 4% PFA.\nExcise organs.\nNote: Coagulation might be seen in the spleen after excision. The coagulated blood is very difficult to clear.\nCritical: From step 4 to step 12, samples should be protected from the light.\nImmerse excised organs (samples) into 4% PFA and shake gently at 4°C for overnight (12–16 h).\nWash samples with PBS to remove 4% PFA.\nExchange solution from PFA to PBS and shake gently for more than 2 h.\nExchange PBS more than 2 times (total wash > 6 h).\nExchange solution from PBS to 50% CUBIC-L and shake gently at 37°C (50–100 rpm).\nAfter over 6 h of incubation, exchange solution with 100% CUBIC-L, shake gently at 37°C for 1–7 days (until the exchanged CUBIC-L solution is not colored).\nCritical: In steps 6 and 7 (delipidation and decolorization process), the solution will be colored as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A. Exchange CUBIC-L until the solution is no longer colored. Moreover, CUBIC-L might damage some kinds of tubes. Exchange tubes if it happens.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/295-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(C) The images of lung and brain at each step (most left, after fixation; second left, after delipidation and decolorization with CUBIC-L; second right, after RI adjustment with CUBIC-R (N); most right, after PBS wash with transparent organs).\n(D) The image of transparent lung stained with RedDot2 (after steps 12 and 13).\nWash samples with PBS to remove CUBIC-L.\nExchange solution from CUBIC-L to PBS and shake gently for more than 2 h.\nExchange PBS more than 2 times (total wash > 6 h).\nOptional: In case of 3D staining (immunostaining including nuclear staining).\nStaining with antibody.\nImmerse samples with antibody dilution in staining buffer (1:100–1:400 depending upon antibody). Shake gently at 22°C for 3 days. Protect from the light.\nRemove antibody solution and wash in PBS.\nExchange solution from antibody solution to PBS and shake gently for more than 2 h.\nExchange PBS more than 2–4 times (total wash > 6 h).\nOptional: Before step 9a, centrifuge diluted antibodies to remove precipitate aggregates (1,000–1,500 × g for 15 min). Use supernatant.\nCritical: Immerse entire organs in staining buffer. Use a container with a round bottom as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B. We prefer to use fluorescent dye or fluorescence proteins conjugated primary antibodies for uniform deep staining.\nOptional: In case of bone samples, decalcification process is needed (Tainaka et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nImmerse bone samples in decalcification solution (i.e., osteosoft).\nOptional: Remove air using vacuum desiccator (10–20 in/hg).\nLeave them at 18°C–26°C for 5–7 days.\nWash samples with PBS to remove antibody solution.\nExchange solution from antibody solution to PBS and shake gently for more than 2 h.\nExchange PBS more than 2 times (total wash > 6 h).\nExchange solution to 50% CUBIC-R (N) and shake gently at 18°C–26°C for more than 6 h. Protect from the light.",
    "Exchange solution to 100% CUBIC-R (N) and shake gently at 18°C–26°C for overnight (12–16 h). Protect from the light.\nNote: The liver might become white instead of clear in very rare cases. We are looking into the cause of this problem, but we have yet to solve it.\nOptional: To avoid movements of organs while acquiring the images by LSFM, organs can be embedded in 2% gel before step 11.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_295_2.csv\nCapture 3D Images\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step describes how to obtain images of cleared tissue samples with LSFM or confocal microscopy.\nTake images with light sheet fluorescence microscopy or confocal microscopy.\nWash samples in CUBIC-R (N) with observation oil.\nPut samples into a glass container fulfilled with observation oil.\nCollect images by light sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) (z = 10 μm step).\nRecord images (TIFF format) and analyze data with Imaris software (see Quantification Analysis).\nNote: Using custom-made LSFM, images were captured at 0.63 × objective lens (numerical aperture = 0.15, working distance = 87 mm) with zoom from 1 × to 6.3 × zoom (zoom 1.25 ×; pixel resolution(x): 8.25 μm, pixel resolution(y): 8.25 μm, pixel resolution(z): 10 μm) (zoom 1.6 ×; pixel resolution(x): 6.45 μm, pixel resolution(y): 6.45 μm, pixel resolution(z): 10 μm). All raw image data were collected in a lossless 16-bit TIFF format.\nPost-imaging Immunohistochemistry (DAB)\nTiming: 2–4 days\nThis step describes how to prepare samples for immunohistochemistry.\nWash samples with PBS.\nPut samples into PBS and shake gently for more than 2 h.\nExchange PBS more than 2 times (total wash > 6 h).\nEmbed samples into paraffin using equipment (including dehydration and delipidation process with ethanol and xylene).\nMake sections using standard histology microtome and mount on glass slide.\nDeparaffinize slides with xylene and ethanol.\nRemove endogenous peroxidase.",
    "Immerse slides in endogenous peroxidase blocking solution.\nIncubate them at 18°C–26°C for 15–20 min.\nWash with tap water or TBS.\nAntigen retrieval.\nImmerse slides into HIER.\nAutoclave them at 121°C for 10 min.\nChill them to 18°C–26°C.\nWash with TBS, rinse with water (to prevent salt crystals) and dry.\nCover 1st antibody and incubate for 2 h to 16 h in a humidified chamber (to prevent drying out).\nWash with TBS.\nExchange solution to TBS and still for 3 min.\nRepeat “a” more than 2 times.\nAdd 2nd antibody labeled with biotin and incubate at 40°C for 30 min.\nWash with TBS.\nExchange solution to TBS and still for 3 min.\nRepeat “a” more than 2 times.\nAdd ABC reagent and incubate at 40°C for 20–30 min.\nWash with TBS.\nExchange solution to TBS and still for 3 min.\nRepeat “a” more than 2 times.\nDAB coloring.\nAdd DAB dilution and incubate for 2–3 min at 18°C–26°C.\nWash with TBS.\nStain nucleus with Meyer.\nWash with tap water.\nDehydration with ethanol and xylene.\nMount slides with coverslip using mounting agents (Malinol, Permount, Histoclad, etc).\nNote: We showed avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method, but we can also apply other direct or indirect immunohistochemistry methods.\nAlternatives: PBS can be used instead of TBS.\nOptional: In case of H&E staining, after step 18, stain slides with hematoxylin and eosin.\nOptional: When making frozen sections with samples after PBS wash (step 14), sucrose exchange process is needed.\nImmerse samples in 5% sucrose in PB and shake gently for 30 min to 1 h.\nExchange solution to 10% sucrose in PB and shake gently for 30 min to 1 h.\nExchange solution to 15% sucrose in PB and shake gently for 30 min to 1 h.",
    "Exchange solution to 20% sucrose in PB and shake gently for 30 min to 1 h.\nFreeze samples with OCT compound.\nPause Point: After taking images (step 13), samples were preserved in CUBIC-R (N). However, leaving samples in CUBIC-R (N) might induce signal dropping. To preserve fluorescent signals, it is better to keep samples in PBS at 4°C after PBS wash to remove CUBIC-R (N).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_295_3.csv"
