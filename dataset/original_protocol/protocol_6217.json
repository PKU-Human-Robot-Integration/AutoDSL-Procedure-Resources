    "Cell preparation and transfectionNote: This protocol describes the recruitment of collagen to Cos-7 cells transiently expressing DDR1.Seed Cos-7 cells on 13 mm coverslips in 24-well plates at 1 to 3 x 104 cells/ml in 500 μl complete DMEM/F12 medium per well to obtain around 30% confluency the next day. Notes: Coverslips were sterilized before use by placing coverslips in a glass beaker and heating in a microwave on full power for 5 min. After heating, the beaker was covered with cling film and aluminum foil and stored at room temperature. Exact cell number for cell seeding is not important but it is important that cells are less than 50% confluent on the day of transfection. After 24 h, transfect cells with relevant DDR1 expression plasmids using Fugene HD according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Note: Transfection conditions may need to be optimized but the transfection solution used for cells seeded on 24-well plates consisted of 50 μl/well OptiMEM medium, 0.25 μg/ml DNA and 0.75 μl/well Fugene HD. The transfection solution was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and added to the cells drop-wise. Medium was changed to fresh complete DMEM/F12 1 h before adding transfection mix. Change medium to fresh complete DMEM/F12 medium 4 h after transfection and incubate for another 24 h.Aspirate medium from cells and add 500 μl of serum-free DMEM/F12 medium/well. Incubate for 16 h before stimulation with collagen-coated beads.Coating of beads with collagen or controlNote: Perform bead coating one day before stimulation of cells. We have not tested whether coated beads can be stored for longer times.Resuspend the latex beads thoroughly by vortexing and transfer aliquots to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for coating with collagen or control. Note: Each well is stimulated with 1 μl starting bead volume.",
    "When stimulating multiple wells, scale up the amount of beads for coating. For example, for stimulating 10 wells, aliquot 10 μl beads for coating. Wash the bead aliquot by adding 1 ml distilled water and centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 x g) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant.Note: The latex beads are supplied as a suspension composed of polymer particles and water, with small amounts of surfactant, sodium bicarbonate and potassium sulfate. Washing the beads in water is required to remove the other components. Resuspend the beads in 1 ml coating buffer and centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 x g) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant.Repeat Step B3.Resuspend beads in 500 μl coating buffer containing 20 μg/ml collagen I or 20 μg/ml BSA control. Incubate overnight on a rotating wheel at 4 °C.Note: We have only tested coating up to 20 μl beads. For coating of higher bead volumes, the coating buffer may need to be scaled up.  After overnight incubation, add 500 μl 1x PBS to beads and centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 x g) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant to remove unbound collagen.To wash beads, add 1 ml 1x PBS to beads and centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 x g) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant.Add 1 ml 1% (w/v) BSA in 1x PBS to both collagen-coated and control beads. Incubate for 1 h on a rotating wheel at room temperature. Centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (1,236 x g) for 1 min. Aspirate supernatant.Resuspend beads in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium. The beads are now ready to use.Note: Each well is stimulated with 1 μl of starting bead volume resuspended in 200 μl serum-free DMEM/F12 medium. For multiple wells, scale up accordingly.Stimulation of cells with collagen-coated beadsAspirate serum-free medium from Cos-7 cells grown on coverslips in 24-well plates.",
    "Resuspend the prepared collagen-coated or control-coated beads thoroughly by vortexing and add 200 μl resuspended beads per well to the cells.Centrifuge plate at 1,200 rpm (290 x g) for 1 min to settle beads. Incubate at 37 °C for the required amount of time. In our study, we incubated the beads on cells for 10 min to 4 h. Cell fixing and stainingNotes: This method explains labeling of surface DDR1 with an antibody against an extracellular epitope, fixing, permeabilization and labeling of phosphorylated DDR1 in Cos-7 cells grown on coverslips after stimulation with collagen-coated beads. Other relevant antibodies may be used for labeling different collagen receptors. After stimulation, wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl ice-cold 1x PBS. Take coverslips from each well with forceps and incubate face down with 30 μl primary anti-DDR1 antibody diluted at 2.5 μg/ml in 8% BSA (w/v), 1x PBS on parafilm spread on metal blocks on ice for 1 h to label cell surface DDR1 only. See Figure 1 for the experimental set-up. Transfer coverslips back to well with cell side facing up and wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl 1x PBS on ice. Aspirate washes.Fix cells by adding 500 μl 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS in a chemical fume hood for 15 min at room temperature. Discard paraformaldehyde solution. Caution: Paraformaldehyde is hazardous, perform fixation in a chemical hood and dispose of paraformaldehyde appropriately. Note: All subsequent steps are performed at room temperature. Wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl 1x PBS. Aspirate washes.Permeabilize cells by adding 500 μl 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 1x PBS for 5 min. Aspirate buffer.Block unspecific binding by incubating coverslips with 8% BSA (w/v) in 1x PBS for 1 h.",
    "Take coverslips from each well with forceps and incubate face down on parafilm with 30 μl primary anti-phosho-DDR1 antibody diluted 1:1,000 in 8% BSA (w/v), 1x PBS for 1 h to label phosphorylated DDR1.Transfer coverslips back to well with cell side facing up and wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl 1x PBS. Take coverslips from each well with forceps and incubate face down on parafilm with 30 μl appropriate secondary antibodies diluted 1:500 in 8% BSA (w/v), 1x PBS for 30 min. Protect from light.Transfer coverslips back to well with cell side facing up and wash coverslips three times each with 500 μl 1x PBS. Mount coverslips on slides with 10 μl Prolong Gold mounting medium.Airdry coverslips at room temperature overnight. Protect from light. Store at 4 °C or proceed to imaging under a fluorescent microscope.E.ImagingImage on a widefield microscope with brightfield capabilities using a 60x oil objective. The beads are imaged using a brightfield channel while total and phosphorylated DDR1 expressed in Cos-7 cells are imaged using appropriate FITC and TRITC fluorescent filters.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190817/20190817045930_7328.jpgFigure 1. Experimental set-up for incubation of coverslips with primary Ab solution on ice. A metal block is placed onto ice, and a piece of parafilm is placed on top of the metal block. The primary Ab solution is spotted in 30 μl aliquots onto the parafilm, then the coverslips are added with cells face down onto the Ab solution and incubated for 1 h."
