    "sGFP spontaneous refoldingProtein UnfoldingAdd 2.5 μl sGFP (20 μM) to a microcentrifuge tube containing 7.5 μl 8 M GuHCl (final GuHCl concentration in the unfolding reaction is 6 M) in buffer A (see Recipes). Place the tube in a dry bath for 1 h at 25°C. This will lead to complete unfolding of the protein.Protein RefoldingSwitch on the Fluorolog instrument (Fluorescence spectrofluorometer). Keep the instrument switched ON for 45 min prior to fluorescence measurement, so that the lamp is uniformly heated and fluctuations are minimal.Set the instrument to emission spectra mode. Keep the excitation wavelength at 350 nm and the emission spectra in the 365-430 nm range. After 45 min, add MilliQ H2O to a quartz microcuvette and take a Raman Spectra. If you get an emission peak at 397 nm, the spectrofluorometer is working fine.Set the instrument to kinetic acquisition mode. Set the excitation wavelength to 480 nm and the emission wavelength to 515 nm. Set to anti-photobleaching mode. Set the collection interval to 20 s and the integration time to 0.7 s. The total time for the kinetics is set to 1,800 s. Set the temperature to 25°C. The slit-width is kept at 2 nm for excitation and 5 nm for emission.Clean a quartz cuvette (Hellma Analytics, 10 mm path length) with 100% methanol and then MilliQ water, and wipe using a kimwipe. Take 2 μl (200 nM final) completely unfolded protein, dilute 100-fold in Buffer A (198 μl), and mix thoroughly by pipetting (total reaction volume 200 μl) in the cuvette.Start the kinetics acquisition as soon as the mixing is finished (keep an equal delay in this step).sGFP refolding typically follows a two-state pathway. The unfolded proteins are refolded in refolding buffer to their native state in a single step.",
    "In the refolding experiment, we monitor the increase in GFP fluorescence by exciting the refolding reaction at 480 nm and measuring the fluorescence emission at 515 nm. GFP fluoresces only after folding into its native state; therefore, GFP fluorescence is the readout for the amount of folded protein in our refolding experiment. The refolding kinetics trace obtained after the refolding reaction can be best fitted using nonlinear regression by a single exponential kinetics equation. The kinetics data are analyzed using the Origin software.A mathematical model to fit the refolding kinetics: The model for fitting the data obtained from refolding experiments is a mathematical equivalent of two-state folding kinetics. The one-phase exponential decay equation is as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210715/20210715171212_1301.png where y0 is the offset, A1 is the amplitude, and t1 is the time constant. The apparent rate of the refolding reaction is obtained by taking the reciprocal of the time constant. A typical refolding kinetics plot is shown in Figure 1a.Chaperonin-assisted sGFP refoldingProtein UnfoldingUnfold sGFP as described earlier in Step A1.Protein Refoldinga, b, c follow steps A2a, b, c as described for spontaneous refolding.Take 2 μl (200 nM) completely unfolded protein and dilute 100-fold in Buffer A containing GroEL (400 nM tetradecamers of GroEL). Add GroES (800 nM heptamers of GroES), such that the ratio of substrate to GroEL toGroES is 1:2:4. The refolding is initiated by the addition of 2 mM ATP (final concentration); the total reaction volume is 200 μl. Mix the reaction thoroughly by pipetting slowly.Start the kinetics acquisition as soon as the mixing is finished (keep an equal delay in this step).A representative refolding kinetics plot is shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1b, 1c, 1d explains the various steps involved in the data analysis for calculating the refolding rate. 1/t1 gives the refolding rate/second.Same as Step A2f.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210719/20210719231831_3936.jpgFigure 1.",
