  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: Mouse brain-derived Endothelial cells.3 (bEnd.3) were inoculated into the chambers of a 24-well plate to construct a simple in vitro model of BBB under specific medium conditions. The TEER of normal cells and hypoxic cells were measured by TEER meter (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\n1. Solution preparation\nPrepare the DMEM cell culture medium containing FBS (10%, v/v), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 10 mg/mL streptomycin (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare 100 mM CoCl2 stock solution by adding 1.30 mg CoCl2 to 100 µL DMSO solution.\n\tNOTE: All the above solutions were stored at 4 °C condition, and the stock solution was diluted according to the desired concentration before use.\nPrepare 5% sodium hypochlorite solution (v/v) by adding 2 mL of sodium hypochlorite solution to 38 mL of double distilled water.\n2. Cell culture and cell viability\nSeed 1 mL of bEnd.3 cells in culture dish (100 mm) containing DMEM medium at a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL and culture at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Change the medium every 2 to 3 days and subculture the cells 2x a week.\nAfter bEnd.3 cells grow to 80 % confluence, digest the cells with 0.25% trypsin for 30 s.\nMake a suspension of bEnd.3 cells at density of 7 x 104 cells/mL using DMEM medium through a cell counter. Then, seed 100 µL of bEnd.3 cell suspension in a 96-well plate.\nAfter cell adhesion, clean the cells with PBS and culture the cells with 100 µL of culture medium or drug-containing medium (100 µM, 200 µM, 300 µM, 400 µM, 500 µM CoCl2) for 24 h under the same conditions. After removing the medium inside the well plate and cleaning it with PBS, add 100 µL of CCK-8 solution.",
    "NOTE: Do not generate bubbles in the well, which will affect the values of optical density (OD).\nPut 96-well plates at 37 °C environment and incubate for 1 h. Measure the absorbance of the 96-well plates at 450 nm using a microplate reader.\n\tNOTE: To avoid intra-group differences, the well plates were cooled to room temperature before detection.\nCalculate the cell viability induced by different concentrations of CoCl2 according to the formula [ODDrug - ODBlank] / [ODControl-ODBlank] x 100%. Select the CoCl2 concentration with a significant difference in cell viability reduction compared with the control group for the next experiment.\n3. Model assembly\nRinse the upper chamber of the 24-well plates with PBS.\n\tNOTE: Cells grew and fused at the bottom of the upper chamber of the 24-well plate, and tight junctions between cells gradually formed to play a barrier role. If the endothelial cells used in some studies are not able to form a complete barrier on PET membranes independently, coating the membranes with collagen IV solution is required prior to cell inoculation.\nMix the bEnd.3 cells with DMEM medium to make a suspension at a density of 5 x 105 cells/mL using a vortex mixer. Then, seed 200 µL of bEnd.3 cell suspension on the PET membrane in the upper chamber of a 24-well plate (0.33 cm2, 0.4 µm membrane pore size).\n\tNOTE: The pilot study of this protocol found no difference in results when using 5 to 10 passages of bEnd.3 cells for experiments. To ensure the probability of successful modeling, please refer to the cell number interval of this protocol.",
    "Add 1200 µL of complete medium to the lower chamber of the plate to ensure that the osmotic pressure of the upper and lower chambers tends to stabilize. There are differences in the volume of medium added depending on the type; ensure that the liquid level of the upper and lower chambers is flush.\nChange the medium of the upper chamber and the lower chamber at a fixed time every day and monitor the resistance value at the same time.\n\t\nWhen changing the medium, the integrity of the cell layer will be damaged by artificial touch or excessive movement. To avoid the above situation, slowly remove the old medium from one side with a negative pressure pipette and slowly add a new medium along the wall during fluid exchange.\n4. Measurement of TEER\nBefore work begins, place the resistor, 5% sodium hypochlorite solution, 75% ethanol, and double distilled water solution in an ultra-clean table. Turn on the UV irradiation for 30 min to eliminate residual bacteria and pathogens.\nPlace the electrodes in 5% sodium hypochlorite solution with slow shaking for 3 s to 5 s, and then immerse in 75% ethanol for 15 min. Finally, transfer to PBS or double distilled water solution until use.\nTurn ON the switch on the back of the cell resistor meter, click Select Plate according to the parameters in Table 1, and select 24-Well Plate.\nAccording to the operation needs, select the appropriate detection sequence. We selected A1 procedure in this study.\nInsert a kΩ resistor into the right plug to calibrate the instrument. If the calibration result is 1000 ± 5 Ω, consider the accuracy of the instrument to be normal.",
    "If the calibration result is not 1000 Ω, click on Mode Units on the main interface to select OHMS, and then click Calibrate on the main screen to re-calibrate the instrument.\nPull out the kΩ resistor on the right side and replace the measuring electrode with a connecting wire.\nPlace the electrode into the 24-well plate without seeding cells vertically and click Blank Handling on the main screen of the instrument. The background value of the plate resistance without seeded cells is about 134.4 Ω.\nInsert the two electrodes into the upper and lower chambers of the seeded plate with cells so that the cell layer is between them, and then record the resistance value by gently stepping on the Pedal.\n\t\nMake sure that the electrode does not touch the cells in the upper chamber and the bottom of the lower chamber. The soaking time of the electrode in the solution has no effect on the resistance value, and it is only necessary to make sure that the electrode is in the correct position.\nObtain TEER values (Ωcm2) by multiplying electrical resistance values (ohms) with the bottom area (cm2) of the upper chamber, as in the equation:\n\tTEER (Ωcm2) = Resistance (Ω) x Sinsert (cm2)\nDraw a line plot of TEER-Time (in days). When the resistance value does not increase further with time (measured over days), consider the cell formed a barrier.\n\tNOTW: The monolayer BBB model of bEnd.3 cells will be successfully constructed by culturing bEND.3 cells with the parameters in this study for about 6 days. The TEER of bEnd.3 cell monolayer model ranged from 16.49 ± 2.12 Ωcm2 to 27.59 ± 1.50 Ωcm2 within 6 days (n=8, mean ± SD).\n5. Barrier destruction and statistical analysis",
    "According to the TEER - time curve, select the wells with barrier function and divide them into the control group and CoCl2 group (n = 4).\nAdd the culture medium and culture medium containing 300 µM CoCl2 (200 µL) into the control group and CoCl2 group upper chamber, respectively.\nDetect the resistance values of the control and CoCl2 groups at 12 h and 24 h of incubation at 37 °C using the procedure described in step 4.\nUse commercial software to map the trend of TEER values of the barrier of cells cultured with or without 300 µM CoCl2.\nUse statistical analysis software to analyze the difference in resistance values between CoCl2-treated cells and normal cells (n=4, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001).\nSubscription Required.
