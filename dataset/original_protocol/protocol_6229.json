    "Caco-2-BBE cells are routinely maintained in tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium containing 10% Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and are put into a cell incubator set at 37 °C, in 5% CO2, and 90% humidity.Observe confluency of Caco2-BBE cells in a 75 cm2 flask under the inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS100) (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190827/20190827232841_3278.jpgFigure 3. Micrograpic image of confluent Caco2-BBE monolayers in 75 cm2 flasks. Magnification: 10x.Under a laminar flow hood, rinse the 75 cm2 flask containing Caco2-BBE cells with PBS 1x (3 times each time with 5 ml PBS).Add 2 ml of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA.Put the 75 cm2 flask containing Caco2-BBE cells with 2 ml of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA into the cell incubator for 5 min.Observe cell dissociation under the inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS100). If well dissociated, add 10 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S media into the flask to inactivate trypsin and thoroughly pipette up and down (using 2 ml plastic pipettes) to break the cell clumps.Place the 75 cm2 flask containing Caco2-BBE cells under the inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS100) and observe that Caco2-BBE cells are a single cell suspension (no cell clumps). If not go back to Step 7.Count the cells using Invitrogen CountessTM automated counter. The CountessTM automated cell counter is a benchtop counter designed to measure cell count and viability (live, dead, and total cells) accurately and precisely, using the standard trypan blue technique.[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/AMQAF1000?SID=srch-srp-AMQAF1000] Plate Caco2-BBE cells at 0.3 x 106 cells per well into two 8W10E+ Cultureware arrays with culture medium volume of 500 μl/well (one array contains 8 wells). The 2 Culturewares (16 wells) in the ECIS array station allow the observer to design experiments with duplicates/triplicates with the appropriate controls.",
    "Put the 2 Culturewares in the ECIS array containing Caco2-BBE cells within the incubator station (see Figure 4) and close the incubator door. Incubator is set at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190827/20190827232910_2760.jpgFigure 4. Two Culturewares in the ECIS array station within the incubatorChose “8W10E” as well configuration.Click the “Set up” button to verify that arrays are properly connected to the system (Figure 5). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190827/20190827232927_7716.jpgFigure 5. ECIS software and set-up procedure to measure epithelial electrical resistance (R). Select “8W1E” as well arrays (1), select all wells in “Holder A and Holder B” (1), click the “Setup” button (2) to check if arrays are properly connected to the system. Wells that are connected to the system show a green color (1). Select “Single Freq.” (3) as 500 Hz (4) and click “Start” (5) and specify where the data are stored. Experiment commments may be documented (6).Wells that are connected to the system show a green color (Figure 5). Wells not connected to the system show a red color. If the array diagram shows red, adjust the position of the Cultureware slightly and click “Check” to make sure that each well of the Cultureware is connected properly to the system.Select “The well to measure”.Select “Single frequency” (For Caco2-BBE, the optimal single frequency is 500 Hz) (Charrier et al., 2005) (Figure 5).Interval (sec): uncheck. (maximum data acquisition) (Figure 5).Click “Start” and specify where the data are stored (Figure 5).When Caco2-BBE reach confluency after 20-30 h growth (Resistance plateau) check “Wound/electroporation Setup” (Figure 6). Select the “Wells to wound” in the “Well Configuration” (Figure 6).Select “Wound time” (30 s [Figure 6], optimal for Caco2-BBE) (Charrier et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2018).Select “Wound Current” (1,400 μA [Figure 6], optimal for Caco2-BBE) (Charrier et al.",
    ", 2005; Zhang et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2018).Select “Frequency” (40k Hz [Figure 6], optimal for Caco2-BBE) (Charrier et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2018).Click “Activate” (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190827/20190827232947_0618.jpgFigure 6. Wound to Caco-2-BBE monolayers. Select the “wells to wound” in the “Well Configuration” (1), select “Wound/Electroporate Setup” (2), select “Wound” (3), select “30 sec” as “Wound Time” (4), select “1400 μA” as “Wound Current” (5), select “40k Hz” as “Frequency” (6) and click “Activate” (7).After wound infliction, verify that the R value drop to a value close to an electrode without cells. If that is not the case, repeat the wounding.After the application of wound to the epithelium, treatments (drug-addition) may be applied to designated wells in order to assess the pro-healing or the anti-healing of the added drug. When the healing is done, R return to the resistance value before the wound, stop the experiment by click “Finish” (Figure 7). Go to file and select “Export data” (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190827/20190827233026_0955.jpgFigure 7. Wound Healing of Caco-2-BBE monolayers. When healing is done, click “Finish” (1), go the “File” (2), select “Export data” (3).As an example, we have demonstrated (Figure 7 in Xiao et al., 2018) that wounded epithelial layers treated with IL-22 (0, 50 and 100 ng/ml as final concentration) showed significant and dose-dependent increase in recovery, in comparison with untreated wounded epithelial layers. These results clearly demonstrate that IL-22 can enhance the healing of a wounded colonic epithelial layer. In another study (Figure 6 in Charrier et al., 2005), we have demonstrated that after the wound, the resistance of Caco2-BBE/ADAM-15 cells (Caco2-BBE over-expressing ADAM-15) did not increase to reach the resistance values of the non-wounded cells (Figure 6A in Charrier et al., 2005).",
    "By contrast, the resistance of Caco2-BBE/Vect cells (endogenous ADAM-15 expression in Caco2-BBE) increased over time and reached the resistance values of the non-wounded cells (Figure 6A in Charrier et al., 2005). These results are in correlation with the observations made at the end of the experiments where the wounds were completely healed in Caco2-BBE/Vect cells but were unable to heal in Caco2-BBE/ADAM-15 cells (Figure 6B in Charrier et al., 2005)."
