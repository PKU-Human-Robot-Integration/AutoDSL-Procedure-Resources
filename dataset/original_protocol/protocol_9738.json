    "This study was conducted with the approval of the Faculty of Social Welfare & Health Sciences at the University of Haifa, ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained, and research was performed in compliance with Helsinki guidelines for human welfare.\nNOTE: The research is conducted at a table, using art materials and a portable, wireless and non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) recording device.\n1. Participant selection\nRecruit healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 40. For a wider range of ages, a division to sub-groups is recommended due to age related changes in heart rate variability.\nExclude participants with current or a history of heart disease as heart disease can affect heart rate variability, thus limiting the ability to examine whether change is due to the behavioral activity.\nInvite all subjects to the laboratory between 08:00-15:00, to ensure similar conditions. Set any time frame as long as the experiment can be conducted within it.\nGreet the participant and confirm that in the 2 hours before the experiment the participant did not drink coffee, eat, smoke or vigorously exercise.\nObtain written informed consent to ensure that participants know they are free to leave the experiment at any point in time without consequence and are aware of any risks and benefits to participation.\n2. Experimental protocol\nAdhere the biopatch two fingers below the sternum with 2 Ag-AgCl disposable electrodes. The ECG is sampled (1000 Hz, 16 bit) and recorded with the biopatch.\nExamine that the values of the data collected (i.e., heart rate, HRV) appear on the graphic interface ensuring that data is being collected. The software will also transmit an audio alarm when the biopatch goes offline.",
    "After the participant adapts to the environment and wears the biopatch, measure 5 min of resting heart rate in a sitting position to establish baseline HRV. Instruct the participant to sit still, and avoid chewing or talking, which affects the HRV.\nFollowing the 5 min rest to establish baseline HRV, instruct participants to fill out pencil and paper questionnaires with demographic data, a question about art making habits and the self-assessment manikin (SAM)5. Instruct participants to mark the drawing that is closest to how they feel at the current moment (See Figure 2).\nTo establish a comparable emotional state, have participants listen to 5 min of relaxing music of their choice (nature sounds, new age or classical music) before each artmaking session. The relaxing music is purposely chosen by the participant to ensure that it is relaxing for them6.\nProvide participants with a (50 cm x 35 cm) sheet of paper and instruct them to engage in a 10 min artmaking session (pencil, oil pastels or gouache paint). To reduce an order affect, randomize the order of the art materials.\n\tNOTE: Here, after drawing with pencil, the participants used oil pastels and then gouache paint.\n\t\nEncourage participants to engage in an exploration of the materials in any way they feel fit and use the entire 10 min for artmaking. Provide encouragement by reminding participants that the art product and its aesthetics are not important and that they can draw anything at all.\nPresent the pencil with a pencil sharpener and an eraser.\nInstruct participants to report their emotional state using the SAM.\nTurn on music and instruct participants to listen to 5 min of relaxing music of their choice (nature sounds, new age or classical music).",
    "Place an open box of 12 colors of oil pastels on the table and instruct participants to use them in any way they choose including peeling the wrapper and breaking the pastel if needed.\n\t\nReplace the box of pastels for the next subject if their general appearance is significantly affected by use.\nInstruct participants to report their emotional state using the SAM.\nTurn on music and instruct participants to listen to 5 min of relaxing music of their choice (nature sounds, new age or classical music).\nPresent gouache paint in primary colors (yellow, red and blue), black and white in a plastic palette, divided into 6 bowls and 4 mixing surfaces, to control the quantities of paint. In addition, provide a jar of water, a soft, flat-headed brush (size 6) and a cloth.\n\t\nTell the subjects that they can request additional paint if needed.\nProvide a short explanation of mixing colors and cleaning the brushes.\nInstruct participants to report their emotional state using the SAM.\nRemove the biopatch from the participant at the end of the session. Download the data recorded with the biopatch to the computer using the biopatch download log.\n3. Data analysis\nConvert the data to a text file that is appropriate for import to the visual analysis software (e.g., QRSTool)7, saving only the time stamp and voltage vectors, using a MATLAB script. The MATLAB script* is helpful in saving the timestamp and voltage vectors, while erasing the rest. This can be done manually but is very time consuming. The resulting text file example is presented in Figure 3.",
    "Import the text file created by the MATLAB script to the QRSTool using the graphical user interface: File | Import | (Choose File). Make sure that the sample rate 1000 Hz button is pressed. The ECG will then be graphically displayed in the window of QRSTool.\nVisually inspect the ECG series for artefacts. Identify the R component of the ECG using the QRS-tool software (See Figure 4). The software automatically detects the R spikes, by flagging all points with a red hourglass, above a threshold marked manually.\n\tNOTE: For more information contact the third author at: jallen@email.arizona.edu\n\t\nVisually inspect each ECG series alongside the identified heartbeats, time points and artefacts (missed or wrongfully identified heartbeats), which may have an excessive or missing heartbeat in the inter-beat intervals graph. Correct this manually by clicking to remove the extra heartbeat or adding one where missing.\nIn areas of data with noise, not showing an identifiable QRS waveform, divide the data into several chunks, of 30 seconds at least.\n\t\tNOTE: Remember, tails of cropped data cannot be added together. Analyze these separately and create a mean of all chunks.\nMark or divide the data according to various phases of the experiment. To do so, use the visual interface to cut off and save only the data for each event and export them separately to CMetX (described below). Divide the data based on the experiment stages described above (baseline, music listening and art making with the various materials).\nWhen all data is clean, export to CMETX by using the visual interface File | Export, or directly by a command line. This will open the CMetX viewer window with an added line with the indices of HRV.\nExport HRV indices to a CSV file for data analysis",
    "Use two indices of HRV: the estimated respiratory sinus arrythmia (RSA) as a vagal or parasympathetic index and the cardiac sympathetic index (CSI) â€“ based on a Lorenz plot that estimates sympathetic influence. Figure 4 is an example of the output provided by the CMetX software.\n\t\tNOTE: Choosing the appropriate HRV index to represent vagal or sympathetic cardiac regulation can be tricky and requires some methodologically and theoretically based decisions that are beyond the scope of this presentation. For further information we recommend reading: Allen, J. J., Chambers, A. S., & Towers, D. N. (2007). The many metrics of cardiac chronotropy: A pragmatic primer and a brief comparison of metrics8.\nEstimate HRV reactivity by subtracting the mean HRV index during music listening from the mean HRV index during the following artmaking session (i.e., positive values represent higher HRV during artmaking compared to the proceeding relaxation).\nSubscription Required.
