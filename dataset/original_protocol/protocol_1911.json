Workflow overview\nPreparation of bone marrow derived macrophages\nTiming: 10–12 days\nMonolayers of bone marrow derived macrophages are prepared as described in (Pichugin et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]), with modifications described in the following steps.\nDay 1:\nProcedure:\nEuthanize the mice using an approved procedure and remove tibia and femurs (some muscle tissue may remain attached, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Store the removed bones in a 50 mL conical tube containing 10 mL Media 0 on ice\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1506-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of bone marrow-derived macrophages\n(A and B) (A) Mice tibia and femur with some attached muscle tissue.\n(B) Separation of interphase by density gradient centrifugation.\nTransfer the removed bones of each mouse in 10 mL ice-cold Media 0 to mortar and gently crush the bones with a pestle.\nRemove the media to a clean tube placed on ice, add 10 mL of fresh ice-cold Media 0 to the mortar and repeat the bone crushing. Combine cell suspensions and store on ice.\nAlternatives: Bone marrow can be isolated using traditional method - flushing the bones with medium using a syringe and a 25G needle. The crushing method is simpler and produces higher cell yields. Care should be taken to avoid bacterial contamination.\nPour fluid over a cell strainer (Φ70 μm) placed on top of a clean 50 mL conical tube and dilute the greasy tissues by adding Media 0 up to 50 mL.\nSpin cells at 200 × g (e.g., in Sorvall RT7, 1,000 rpm) for 10 min at 20°C–25°C, then resuspend cell pellets in 5mL of Media 0 per each mouse.",
    "Gently break clumps by pipetting up and down several times using 1mL wide-bore tips (Thermo Scientific, Cat. #21-236-2C). Avoid air bubbles. Allow remaining clumps to settle by placing the tube in a vertical position for 10 min\nAdd 5 mL of LymphoprepTM (1.077A) (StemCell, Cat. #07801) to a clean 15 mL centrifuge tube and carefully overlay with 5 mL of the bone marrow suspension using a 5 mL pipette.\nCritical: For proper density gradient separation: (i) do not transfer the cell clumps from the bottom; (ii) overlay the cells slowly, do not disturb the gradient interface; (iii) subsequent steps are performed at 20°C–25°C.\nPerform gradient centrifugation at 600 × g for 20 min at 20°C–25°C with brakes off.\nNote: Switching the centrifuge brakes off is important for preserving the gradient interface.\nGently remove cells from the interface using a 5 mL serological pipette (Fisherbrand, Cat. #13-678-11D). Place the pipette tip at the interface and collect the cells while slowly moving the tip over/at the top of the interface for taking up the cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nTransfer the collected cells from each gradient (from one mouse) into a 50 mL conical tube. Add Media 0 to a total volume of 50 mL and centrifuge 200 × g (1,000 rpm) for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nSlowly remove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 mL Media 0 at 20°C–25°C and centrifuge at 200 × g (1,000 rpm) for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nResuspend cells in 5 mL Media 1, count and dilute to a final concentration of 1–3×106 cells/mL, and add a to a 25 cm2 polystyrene tissue culture-treated flask.\nIncubate cells for 24 h in a humidified incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 to remove adherent cells.\nDay 2:\nTransfer all non-adherent cells to a new 75 cm2 polystyrene tissue culture-treated flask.",
    "Wash the 25 cm2 flask with 10 mL Media 1 to recover any remaining cell in suspension and transfer to the same 75 cm2 flask (Approximate final cell concentration is 5–7×105 cells/mL).\nIncubate cells for two days in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nDay 4:\nCollect non-adherent cells and centrifuge at 200 × g (1,000 rpm) for 10 min at 20°C–25°C, and resuspend cells in 10 mL Media 3.\nCount the cells. Expect 3–5 × 106 cells per mouse. Dilute the cells in Media 3 to a final concentration of 2.5×105 cells/mL\nPlate 1.5×106 cells per well in 6 well ultra-low attachment plate (Costar/Corning Cat. #3471).\nIncubate cells 2 days in humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: At this step you may (i) proceed with the macrophage monolayer preparation; (ii) freeze extra cells at 2×106 cells per vial in 1 ml FBS with 10% DMSO; (iii) expand the cells by an additional passage on ultra-low attachment plate as in step 17.\nDay 6: Preparation of macrophage monolayer\nCollect all cells (non-adherent and partially attached) enriched after step 20 from 6 well ultra-low attachment plate by pipetting up and down several times avoiding bubbles, and centrifuge at 200 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C and resuspend in antibiotic-free media (Media 2). Alternatively use gentle scrapping.\nCount and dilute the cells in Media 2 and plate 15×103 cells per well (in 200 μL volume) in a 96 well plate.\nIncubate cells for 2 days in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nAfter 2 days replace 90% of old media with the same volume of fresh Media 2 pre-warmed at 37°C.\nIncubate cells for additional 2 days in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.",
    "Note: At this step, the cells form monolayer. If required, they can be maintained for additional 2 days after replacing the medium as in step 24. At this stage the cells are ready either for infection only or for treatment with compounds to assess a specific effect, followed by infection.\nCritical: Macrophage monolayers for Mtb infection are prepared in antibiotic free medium for at least 4 days prior to the infection, including two media changes.\nMedium is replaced 1 day before infection. After that, cells can be treated with cytokines or small molecules, i.e., the day before the infection.\nThe method described in this protocol produces high macrophage yields, homogeneous macrophage populations and uniform monolayers, critical for reproducible results of Mtb infection experiments. Other methods to prepare macrophage monolayers are also suitable.\nPreparation of Mtb for infection\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis step is performed inside the Biosafety level 3 facility (BSL3) using standard operating procedures, protocols and disinfectants approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). All work is performed inside Biosafety Cabinets (BSC).\nDilute 0.5–1.0 mL of a frozen Mtb stock in 5 mL of liquid culture medium (we use Middlebrook 7H9 Broth with OADC), add to a 30 mL square sterile media bottle (Nalgene, Cat. #79053), close the cap tightly to prevent opening and place the bottle(s) and adsorbent paper in a secondary container with a leakage proof lid to avoid aerosols.\nIncubate at 37°C for 2–3 days in a shaking incubator at 100 rpm (to OD600 = 0.4–0.5). To avoid clumping, do not overgrow the bacteria.\nAfter 2–3 days transfer the Mtb suspension from the media bottle to a sterile 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge for 10 min at 2,100 × g (∼3,000 rpm) at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of Media 2 pre-warmed to 37°C (avoid bubbles or foam).\nSonicate twice for 5 s each using a sonicating water-bath with a 5–10 s interval at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 5 mL of pre-warmed Media 2, mix and leave the tube in a vertical position for 30–60 min at 20°C–25°C to let the residual clumps settle down. Use the upper 8 mL for subsequent steps without disturbing the clumps at the bottom.\nRemove plunger from a 10mL “control syringe” (BD, Cat. #309695). Attach the syringe barrel to a 5 μm filter (Micron Separation) and place the filter on top of a 15 mL conical tube secured in a rack. Transfer the top 8 mL of the Mtb suspension, insert the plunger and press to filter the bacterial suspension.\nNote: Hold the syringe, filter, and the reception tube with one hand and rapidly insert the plunger and gently press with the other hand. Slow filtration at gravity force will result in a loss of Mtb.\nMeasure OD of the liquid Mtb bacterial culture at A600 using the dilution medium as a blank control. Expected OD600 after filtration is between 0.1 and 0.2. Calculate the bacterial concentration assuming that after filtration single-cell Mtb suspension at OD600 = 1 is approx. 3×108 bacteria per mL.\nDilute the Mtb suspension with Media 2 to the required concentration for macrophage infection. For example, to infect macrophages in 96 well format at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1:1, prepare 0.5×106 bacteria per mL and add 0.1 mL per well. At OD600 = 0.1 after filtration, the bacterial suspension is estimated at 3×107 bacteria per mL and should be diluted 60-fold. Plate an aliquot of Mtb on solid media and count colonies 3 weeks later to determine the precise infectious dose retrospectively.",
    "Preparation of BCG spike for normalization\nTiming: 2–3 h\nAvirulent vaccine strain of M. bovis BCG is prepared in the BSL2 lab using the same procedure as described for Mtb in steps 26–35.\nAfter filtration, dilute BCG 10-fold in PBS (to approx. 3–5×106 cells per mL) to avoid clumping and store at 4°C up to 21 days.\nInfection of macrophages and maintenance of infected macrophage cultures\nTiming: 0–10 days\nTransfer the 96 well plates containing macrophage cultures into the BSL3 facility.\nRemove 50% volume (100 μL for 96 well plate) of media prior to infection.\nPrepare a bacterial suspension for each multiplicity of infection (MOI) to be used by diluting the Mtb suspensions (prepared in step 35) in Media 2. Place 10 mL of the diluted Mtb in a 100 mm petri dish.\nTo infect macrophage monolayers, add 100 μL of the bacterial suspension to each well of the 96 well plate using a multichannel pipette.\nNote: Save filtered bacterial suspensions in a 2.0 mL screw-cap tube for plating on solid medium (Middlebrook 7H10 Agar) to determine inoculum by colony forming units (CFU) enumeration.\nTo avoid spills or danger of leakage, use centrifuge platforms with biocontainment lids and centrifuge the plates at 200 × g for 5 min at 22°C–25°C to facilitate infection and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 2 h.\nTo eliminate extracellular bacteria, add amikacin (to a final concentration of 200 μg/mL) and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 30–45 min.\nWash the cells 3 times with Media 4 at 20°C–25°C. To avoid drying of monolayers, replace 90% of the media and cover the plate with a lid after removing the media.\nIncubate cells in a final volume of 200 μL Media 2 per well.",
    "Note: If cells need to be treated with any drug, dilute the compound at 2× concentration in Media 2 and then add 100 μL to each well containing macrophage monolayers in 100 μL of media.\nPlace the plates inside secondary containers (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) with covers slightly opened to allow for gas exchange and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity, changing medium every two days.\nWashing of infected monolayers in BSL3\nTiming: 30 min\nCarefully remove 90% of supernatant (180 μL for 96 well plate) from the infected plate and dispose into liquid waste container containing an undiluted approved disinfectant.\nNote: Ensure the effective concentration of the disinfectant in final volume after all washing steps. For example, use 5 mL of Vesphene II (100× concentrate) per 500 mL container.\nImmediately add Media 2 pre-warmed to 37°C (200 μL for 96 well plate).\nCritical: Infected cells can be maintained by replacing 90% of the old media with fresh antibiotic-free media (Media 2) with or without experimental treatment every 48 h.\nIt is recommended to work with 1–3 columns/rows at a time, covering the plate with a lid between steps to prevent the monolayer drying.\nStaining and fixation\nTiming: 2–3 h\nTiming: 1 h (step 49)\nTiming: 1 h (step 50)\nStaining with Live/Dead Stain\nCarefully remove media from infected plates and dispose into liquid waste containers.\nWash cells once with washing media.\nAdd 100 μL of staining solution.\nAlternatives: Any fixable live/dead dye can be used to analyze the viability of cells.\nIncubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 30 min in the dark.\nRemove 90% (90 μL) staining solution and wash the cells 2 times with 200 μL washing media.\nFixation with 4% PFA",
    "Carefully remove washing media and add 100 μL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nIncubate cells at 22°C–25°C for 30 min in dark.\nNote: Fixation time is extended to kill pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nWash cells twice with washing media and cover the macrophage monolayer with washing media by adding a final volume of 200 μL per well.\nSeal the plate with parafilm, wipe with an approved disinfectant, place in a sealed container and safely remove it from BSL3 following standard operating procedures.\nOutside BSL3 containment\nTiming: 2 days\nTiming: 2 h (step 51)\nTiming: 6–7 h (step 52); 1 h (step 52a); 3 h (step 52b); 2 h (step 52c)\nImaging for analysis of cell numbers and dead cells\nRemove 90% of washing media from the infected plate (approx. 180 μL) and add 100 μL/well Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye (final concentration 50 μg/mL) suspended in 1× PBS.\nIncubate the plate at 20°C–25°C for 15 min in the dark.\nRemove the Hoechst dye and add 200 μL/well of 1× PBS. Cover the plate with aluminum foil.\nImage and analyze the total and dead cell numbers using the Nexcelom Celigo imaging cytometer (select Live-or-Dye™ 594/614 Fixable Viability dye fluorescence for dead cells and Hoechst stain for total cells).\nAlternatives: Other automated fluorescence microscopy systems can be used.\nCell lysis and DNA isolation using magnetic beads\nPreparation of Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) magnetic beads\nNote: The SPRI beads are prepared according to (DeAngelis et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nResuspend stock solution of Sera-Mag SpeedBeads by vortexing.\nNote: Vortex magnetic beads until the solution becomes uniformly distributed (vortex 4–5 times for 5 s each).\nAliquot 3 mL beads into a 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd 20 mL 1× TE buffer and pellet beads in a magnetic rack for 20–30 min at 20°C–25°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).",
    "Remove 1× TE buffer without disturbing magnetic beads and repeat step iii.\nRemove 1× TE buffer and resuspend the beads in 5 mL of nuclease free water.\nAdd resuspended beads to the PEG buffer (the volume of PEG buffer is around 140 mL)\nNote: PEG buffer recipe is provided in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nWash the 50 mL conical tube with another 5 mL nuclease free water and add to PEG buffer.\nStore the PEG buffer containing magnetic beads at 4°C in dark.\nNote: Use the prepared SPRI magnetic bead suspension within one month.\nCell lysis\nRemove 1× PBS from the plate and add 200 μL/well of 30 mM glycine solution in 1× PBS for 5 min to quench PFA.\nRemove glycine solution and wash cells 2 times with 1× PBS.\nAliquot sufficient volume of the lysis buffer containing Proteinase K (described in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) in a separate tube (50 μL per well, i.e., 5 mL/plate).\nAdd BCG to the lysis buffer and mix. The number of BCG per well should approximately match the expected Mtb load. For example, add 15×103 CFU of BCG per well if monolayers were infected with Mtb at MOI =1, i.e., add 1.5×106 BCG to the 5 mL of the lysis buffer to prepare the stock solution.\nRemove 1× PBS and add 50 μL of the lysis buffer stock solution containing BCG to each well.\nNote: Avoid drying the fixed monolayers.\nIncubate the plate at 600 C for 45 min to lyse macrophages and release the bacteria.\nTransfer the lysate to a PCR plate and heat at 95°C for 45 min to lyse the bacteria (Mtb and BCG).",
    "Centrifuge the plate for 1 min at 200 × g to collect liquid at the bottom and add an equal volume (50 μL) of neutralization buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH ∼ 6, see note in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section). By adding an equal volume of the neutralization buffer to the lysate, the final pH will be adjusted to 7.5–8.0).\nNote: At this stage the lysates can be used immediately for DNA isolation, stored 16–18 h at 4°C, or stored frozen at −20°C for up to 1 month.\nDNA isolation and enrichment\nFor DNA isolation add 70 μL SPRI magnetic bead suspension (prepared in step 52 a) per well and mix by pipetting up and down, until the bead suspension is homogeneous.\nIncubate the PCR plate at 22°C–25°C for 15–20 min.\nPlace the PCR plate on a magnetic plate (Life Technologies, Cat. #12331D) and allow precipitation of magnetic beads for 15–20 min.\nNote: an extended time of 15–20 min is necessary because the lysate is viscous.\nKeeping the plate on the magnetic plate, carefully remove flow-through without disturbing or removing any magnetic beads (approx. volume would be ∼170 μL) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nAdd 180 μL of 70% ethanol per well to wash the SPRI magnetic beads.\nIncubate the plate for 2 min at 22°C–25°C and remove 70% ethanol keeping the PCR plate on the magnetic plate.\nRepeat the wash step two more times, and remove ethanol.\nRemove PCR plate from the magnetic plate and incubate at 37°C for 15 min to evaporate residual ethanol.\nAdd 40 μL nuclease free water, mix by pipetting up and down, incubate at 22°C–25°C for 15–20 min to elute DNA from the beads.\nPlace the PCR plate back on the magnetic plate at 22°C–25°C for 2 min.",
