    "Part I: Organotypic slice culture Please see Figure 2 for images of the selected procedures. Dissection and slicingWarm 2 × 50 ml Tyrode’s solution, SCM (see below) to 37°C.Melt 3% low-melting agarose in PBS and keep at 37°C.Dissect mouse or ferret embryos in Tyrode’s solution (3 embryos per experiment).Move the heads to warm Tyrode’s solution (37°C) and dissect the brains one by one in a 6-cm Petri dish.Dissect the telencephala and store on a heating plate in Tyrode’s solution.Note: For human tissues, start from this step. Remove the meninges after incubating the telencephala in Tyrode’s solution.Embed the telencephala in low-melting agarose (takes about 30 min).Cut the telencephala in PBS with a vibratome into 250-300-µm slices.Dissect the neocortical region of interest using a scalpel, if necessary.Collagen gel embedding and culturePrepare the collagen gel mixture (see below) on ice under a hood.Transfer the slices, pre-rinsed in collagen, to a dish containing collagen (on ice) using a Pasteur pipet and ensure that the slices are fully immersed in the collagen gel mixture by gently pipetting up and down.Transfer the slices and collagen gel mixture (200-300 µl) to a clean dish.Place the slices in the desired position.Remove the excess collagen using a fine-tip Pasteur pipet (<200 µl).Polymerize the collagen gel on a heating plate at 37°C for 5 min.Transfer the dishes to a cell culture incubator and incubate the slices for 30-40 min.Add 2 ml SCM (for mouse and ferret) or SCM-KOSR (for human) and continue slice culture for the desired time.Note: Start inhibitor treatment at this step. Keep the slices in the cell culture incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 + 40% O2 + 55% N2 for up to two days.",
    "Part II: Hemisphere rotation (HERO) culture DissectionDissect the mouse or ferret brain from the head and place into a 6-cm Petri dish containing PBS at room temperature.Remove the meninges in PBS.Note: You do not need to completely remove the meninges. If you are interested in the lateral neocortex, you can keep the meninges in the medial part. Remove the medulla and cerebellum.CultureWarm the SCM to 37°C.Add 1.5 ml SCM to a whole-embryo culture bottle.Transfer the hemisphere(s) to the whole-embryo culture bottle (1-3 hemispheres per bottle) using a spoon.Note: Start inhibitor treatment at this step. Place the hemispheres in the whole-embryo culture incubator at 37°C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 + 40% O2 + 55% N2 for mouse tissue and 5% CO2 + 60% O2 + 35% N2 for ferret tissue, with continuous rotation at 6 rpm for up to two days.Part III: Free-floating tissue (FFT) culture Dissection and culture of mouse and ferret neocortexDissect the brain from the head and place in a 6-cm Petri dish containing PBS at room temperature.Remove the meninges in PBS.Dissect the neocortical region of interest using a scalpel and dissection scissors. The size of the tissue is approximately 20-50 mm2.Warm the SCM to 37°C.Add 1.5 ml SCM to a whole-embryo culture bottle.Note: Start inhibitor treatment at this step. Transfer the tissue to the whole-embryo culture bottle (1-2 tissue pieces per bottle) using a spoon.Place the tissue in the whole-embryo culture incubator at 37°C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 + 40% O2 + 55%N2 for mouse tissue and 5% CO2 + 60% O2 + 35% N2 for ferret tissue, with continuous rotation at 6 rpm for up to three days.Dissection, pre-incubation, and culture of human neocortexRemove the meninges in PBS.Dissect the neocortical region of interest using a scalpel and dissection scissors.",

Images illustrating key steps of the ex vivo slice/tissue culture protocols. Representative images of the slice, hemisphere rotation (HERO), and free-floating tissue (FFT) culture methods. The combination of letters and numbers corresponds to the steps of each protocol. Arrowheads indicate the neocortical slices/tissues/hemispheres."
