    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSelect clones with higher AQP gene copy number\nTiming: 2 days\nOverproduction of the desired protein often depends on the copy number of the respective gene incorporated in the host genome. For Pichia, this sometimes leads to so-called jackpot clones with substantially higher expression levels than the other clones. To evaluate the expression level, we follow a somewhat modified protocol to that described in the EasySelect Pichia Expression Kit manual for screening AQP expression levels in Pichia, see below.\nDraw a numbered grid (1–60) on the petri dish of an YPD-agar plate containing 2,000 μg/mL zeocin.\nRandomly select 60 colonies from the transformation plate and spot them on the high-zeocin (2,000 μg/mL) using sterile 10 μL pipet tips.\nCritical: It is important to select colonies spread out over the whole transformation plate. If the transformation plate is older than 1 week, the colonies should first be spotted on an YPD-agar plate with 100 μg/mL zeocin and grown for 2 days at 30°C before being transferred to the high-zeocin plate (2,000 μg/mL).\nIncubate the plate at 30°C for 2 days.\nSelect a minimum of 10 colonies that look larger in size than the others for small-scale expression analysis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1556-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Small-scale screening of AQP expression in Pichia pastoris\n(A and B) (A) P. pastoris transformants grown on a YPD-agar plate containing 2,000 μg/mL zeocin. The red and green circles indicate colonies that are expected to have lower (red) and higher (green) copy number of the AQP gene, as estimated by their size. (B) Western blot result from small-scale expression analysis. Clones corresponding to lane 5 and 7 have comparatively higher band intensity (marked with red dotted boxes), demonstrating higher expression of the target protein.",
    "Note: A larger colony size on the high zeocin plate correlates with higher resistance to zeocin due to multiple insertion events into the genome and therefore also with higher expression levels of the protein of interest (Öberg et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nGrow selected colonies at small scale\nTiming: 4 days\nGrow each selected colony separately in 5 mL buffered complex glycerol (BMGY) medium in a 50 mL Falcon tube overnight with 200–300 rpm rotation at 30°C. Keep the lids loosely attached to the tubes to allow for proper aeration.\nCheck the optical density of the culture at 600 nm (OD600). Transfer the volume of cells that is equivalent to an OD600 of 1 in 5 mL to a new 50 mL Falcon tube. Add complex methanol (BMMY) medium to a final volume of 5 mL.\nNote: Methanol replaces glycerol as the carbon source and will induce the expression of the AQP gene.\nFor each clone, prepare 0 h induction samples for a western blot as follows:\nTransfer 1 mL of the BMMY-sample (1 OD-unit) into a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and freeze the cell pellet for later use as the 0 h induced sample in the western blot.\nGrow the remaining 4 mL of the BMMY-culture for 24 h with 200–300 rpm rotation at 30°C.\nCheck the OD600 of each culture and prepare 24 h induction samples for the western blot as in step 7.\nAdd 100% methanol to rest of the culture to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v) methanol and grow for another 24 h.\nCritical: Be careful not to add more methanol than needed. It is toxic for the cells and accumulates if present in higher amounts than needed to sustain growth.",
    "Check the OD600 at 48 h and prepare 48 h induction samples for the Western blot as described in step 7.\nPause point: Cells can be stored at −20°C for a month and at −80°C for years before analyzing the samples by the western blot method.\nOptional: If desired, the cultures can be grown for longer and samples taken out at later time points in order to determine the optimal induction time before harvesting. In our experience, 48 h is sufficient for most AQPs, however, 72 h have been shown to be beneficial in some cases. Please note that, since the methanol is consumed, it is essential to add methanol to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v) every 24 h.\nAnalyze AQP expression levels by western blot\nThaw the frozen samples that were collected at different induction time points.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 40 μL of 2× SDS loading-buffer and heat the samples for 5 min at 95°C.\nCritical: Do not centrifuge the samples after heating as this may pellet down the membrane fraction, resulting in a false negative result in the small-scale expression analysis. Also, do not vortex the sample in order to resuspend the pellet as this may result in foaming. Instead, gently pipette up and down 4–5 times before loading on SDS-PAGE.",
    "Optional: If desired, a very small membrane fraction of the samples can be isolated for small-scale expression analysis. To do this, resuspend the thawed cell pellet in 100 μL of breaking-buffer and place on ice. Add an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads. Vortex 8 × 30 s with 30 s incubation on ice in between. Centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min in a desktop centrifuge at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and pellet down the crude membrane by centrifuging at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 1 h. Resuspend crude membranes in 30 μL of 2× SDS-PAGE loading-buffer. Alternatively, the crude membranes can be pelleted down using a desktop ultracentrifuge (120,000 × g, for 1 h at 4°C), however, we find the recovery from centrifugation in a desktop centrifuge is sufficient for this analysis, and as the final pellet is less compact, it is easier to resuspend in SDS-PAGE loading-buffer. Load 10 μL for SDS-PAGE and follow the same protocol as for the whole cell fraction.\nRun the samples on an SDS-PAGE gel. We use NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in an Xcell SureLock Mini-Cell chamber (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nAssemble the chamber with the gel according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nFill up the chamber with SDS running-buffer.\nLoad 10 μL of each sample in each well of the gel, leaving one well empty for the protein ladder.\nLoad 5 μL pre-stained protein ladder (Spectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder, Thermo Fisher) in the empty well.\nRun the gel at 200 volts (constant) for 35 min (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).",
    "Transfer the protein bands from the gel to a nitrocellulose (Amersham Protran 0.45 μM NC) or polyvinylidene diflouride (PVDF) blotting membrane. We use an XCell II Blot Module and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.\nBlock the membrane using 5% (w/v) dry milk in tris-buffered saline with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at 22°C.\nIncubate with a primary anti-His monoclonal antibody (5,000× dilution in TBST with 5% (w/v) dry milk) for 1 h at 22°C.\nWash the membrane for 3 × 10 min in TBST.\nIncubate the membrane with a suitable horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (5,000× dilution in TBST with 5% (w/v) dry milk) for 1 h at 22°C.\nWash the membrane for 3 × 10 min in TBST.\nDevelop the membrane with ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) following the manufacturer’s protocol.\nAnalyze the chemiluminescence using a western blot imaging system (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nCompare the intensity of the western blot signal in the different clones in order to identify the one with the highest AQP expression level (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Since AQPs are integral membrane proteins, they often do not migrate according to the molecular weight and, also for purified protein, we most often observe bands for multiple oligomeric states, including those larger than the physiologically relevant tetramer. When estimating the expression level, it is important to take the intensity of all these bands into consideration. When using cellular lysates as samples for western blot, we frequently observe high molecular weight oligomers, as seen for AQP4 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Nevertheless, the band intensity still correlates to the final protein yield for the specific clone and the protein is stable and homogenous after purification (Kitchen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nOverproduce human AQPs in P. pastoris at large scale\nTiming: 7 days",
    "This protocol is compatible for overproducing any human aquaporin in P. pastoris under the control of the AOX1 promoter. The culture is first fed with glycerol as the carbon source in order to generate bio-mass before switching to methanol for induction of AQP expression. We use a 3 L fermenter (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to allow for close monitoring of growth conditions, which is advantageous due to the risk of methanol accumulation that could lead to hampering of cell growth.\nAlternatives: Overproduction can also be achieved in baffled shaker flasks, similarly to what is done in the small-scale expression protocol above, in which case methanol should be added to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v) every 24 h (see EasySelect Pichia Expression Kit manual for details). However, it should be noted that while it is assumed that all methanol is consumed within 24 h in most cases, this may vary depending on growth rate. To avoid the risk of methanol accumulation, a fermenter is therefore a better alternative when available and, in our experience, leads to higher cell and protein yield.\nDay 1 – Prepare the fermenter and media.\nStreak a single colony from the desired clone on a YPD-agar plate without antibiotics and incubate it for 2 days at 30°C.\nInoculate 100 mL YPD-medium in a 250 mL flask with a swab of cells from the plate and grow at 30°C for 16 h. Check OD600, normally it reaches 20–25 after 16 h.\nPrepare 1.5 L Basal Salt Medium (BSM).\nAssemble the fermenter according to the manufacturer’s instructions (excluding any parts that should not be autoclaved).\nPour the BSM into the 3 L fermenter jar using one of the free ports and autoclave the fermenter vessel with BSM together with the following items:",
    "Accessory tubing e.g., glycerol tubing (excluding HCl and Ammonia tubing).\n200 mL 50% (v/v) glycerol.\nAn empty 500 mL bottle (for methanol).\n20 mL 50% (v/v) Polypropylene glycol P 2,000 in H2O (anti-foam solution).\nPrepare 100 mL Pichia trace metals (PTM) and sterile filter it using a 0.2 μM Corning® syringe filter.\nNote: The PTM-solution can be stored at 22°C for a maximum of 6 months.\nDay 2 – Inoculate and feed with glycerol.\nPlan to inoculate the fermenter at around 4 pm, so that the glycerol provided in the BSM will be depleted by 7–8 am on the following day.\nConnect all tubing, equipment and bottles containing base (25% (v/v) ammonia), acid (1 M HCl) and anti-foam solution to the fermenter following manufacturer’s instructions.\nCalibrate the pH electrode which should be pH 4 and 7 and wash the pH electrode with 70% (v/v) ethanol before inserting it into the fermenter vessel.\nCalibrate the oxygen detector, setting the dissolved oxygen (DO) to 0% when the detector is disconnected and 100% when the detector is reconnected (gas flow 1 L/min and stirring of 500 rpm). Wash the oxygen detector probe with 70% (v/v) ethanol before inserting into the fermenter vessel.\nAdjust the pH of the BSM to 5 by adding base.\nAdd 6.5 mL of PTM to BSM.\nInoculate BSM in the fermenter with the 100 mL overnight starter culture.\nSet the fermenter parameters (we use temperature 30°C, pH 5.0–5.1, DO 25%, gas flow 1 L/min stirring 800–1,500 rpm) and run overnight.\nDay 3 – Induce with methanol.",
    "At around 7–8 am the following day, the glycerol in the culture will have been consumed, generating a spike in the DO graph. The time point could vary depending on the cell density of the starting culture and growth of the strain being used. After a supplementary glycerol feed during the day, the methanol feed is started in the afternoon which will induce the AQP expression.\nNote: The appropriate feeding speeds will depend on the pump and tubing. Hence, the speeds given in the protocol are merely indicative.\nOnce observing the DO spike, feed the culture with additional 200 mL of 50% (v/v) glycerol mixed with 2.4 mL PTM as follows:\nStart the feed at a medium speed of 10 mL/h.\nIncrease it slowly to 27 mL/h throughout the day while carefully observing the DO which should be maintained around 20–25.\nAdd a few drops of antifoam if it is foaming a lot.\nAt around 3 pm, switch off the glycerol feed.\nWait to see a spike in DO to make sure that any accumulated glycerol has been depleted.\nSwitch the feed to 99% (v/v) methanol (400 mL) mixed with 4.8 mL PTM and start feeding at a medium pump speed (10 mL/h) for 20 min.\nSwitch off the methanol feed, and wait for about 2 h for a DO spike to appear.\nOnce seeing the DO spike, switch on the methanol feed at low speed (2 mL/h) in order to avoid accumulation. Estimate a total use of 400 mL of methanol during 48 h of induction.\nAdd 500 μL anti-foam and leave it for the next 16 h. If the culture is already foaming a lot, do the following:\nSwitch off the gas, wait for it to settle and switch it back on.",
    "Repeat this until it can run calmly with both gas and methanol again.\nWait 10 min to make sure foaming doesn’t start again.\nDay 4 – Continue the methanol feed.\nIncrease the methanol feed pump speed gradually to 7 mL/h throughout the day.\nIncrease the methanol feed pump if turning off the methanol resulted in a DO spike within 30 s.\nSwitch the methanol feed back to the same speed as before if the spike does not appear in 30 s.\nStabilize the DO around 25 and leave it with the same feeding rate for next 16 h.\nMake sure there is enough methanol left in the bottle to last for 16 h.\nDay 5 – Harvest cells.\nHarvest the cells after 48 h induction (or whatever time point you found optimal in the small-scale expression screening).\nTurn off everything except for stirring (500 rpm) and gas flow (1 L/min).\nConnect the sample collecting tube and transfer the culture into centrifugation flasks.\nCentrifuge at 9,000 × g for 30 min using 1 L polypropylene bottles to harvest the cells.\nDiscard the supernatant and spoon the cells into a 2–3 L plastic bag. Flatten the content and weigh the cells (we typically obtain 600 g of wet cells from a 2 L fermenter culture).\nDisassemble and clean the fermenter according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPause point: The cells can be stored at −20°C for at least a month without affecting the yield of the protein after purification but for longer time storage, keep the cells at −80°C.\nPrepare membranes from P. pastoris cells expressing human AQP\nTiming: 1 d ay\nThis protocol is optimized to prepare membrane from 100 g of cells using a BSP BioSpec bead beater (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).",
    "Alternatives: Pichia pastoris cells can be broken using other cell disruption methods as well. We have previously successfully used French press (Frick et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) as well X-press systems (Nyblom et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). In terms of affordability and efficiency, we have found the bead beater to be the best option, however for proteins that are highly sensitive to heat, other methods may be more advantageous. Sonication does not generally work well for yeast due to the presence of a cell wall.\nPre-chill the stainless-steel breaking chamber and 200 mL glass beads at −20°C for 1–2 h or 16 h.\nPrepare 200 mL breaking-buffer and leave it to cool down in the fridge or in an ice-bath.\nWeigh 100 g of fresh or frozen cells in a 400 mL glass beaker.\nAdd 100 mL breaking-buffer and stir at room temperature for 30 min to thaw and resuspend the cells.\nAdd 2 mL of 100 mM PMSF, resulting in a final concentration of 2 mM PMSF in the sample.\nFill the ice jacket with ice and assemble the rotor on the rotor base according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nRun the bead beater for 24× 30 s with 30 s of pause in between each run. Add more ice to the ice jacket if necessary, as the bead beating generates heat.\nDecant the sample carefully into a 500 mL polypropylene centrifuge bottle. Avoid including as much glass beads as possible.\nWash the beads by adding 100 mL breaking-buffer and add the washing solution to the sample.\nCentrifuge the sample using a JLA-10,500 rotor at 16,500 × g for 40 min at 4°C to spin down cell debris and unbroken cells.\nTransfer the supernatant to several Ti45 ultracentrifuge tubes and collect the membranes through ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C.",
    "Discard supernatant and estimate the amount of collected membranes by weighing the tubes before and after transferring the pellets to a potter homogenizer.\nWash the membranes by adding 10 mL urea buffer per gram of membrane and homogenize until the pellet has been completely suspended in the buffer.\nNote: This step removes loosely bound proteins and peripheral membrane proteins.\nTransfer the homogenized sample to ultracentrifuge Ti45 tubes. Wash the homogenizer with an additional 3 mL of urea buffer and add this to the tubes in order to completely transfer all the sample. Centrifuge at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and transfer the pellet to the homogenizer. Weigh the pellet as in step 62, add 10 mL of membrane buffer with added 1 mM PMSF and 2 mM EDTA pH 9 (final concentrations) per gram of membrane and homogenize.\nNote: Please be aware that the pellet may be quite soft in parts so make sure to not discard too much by accident.\nTransfer the sample to Ti45 ultracentrifuge tubes and wash the homogenizer with membrane buffer as in step 64. Centrifuge again at 200,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant, weigh the membrane pellet and homogenize in 0.5 mL/g membrane-buffer. Divide the resuspended membranes into 10 mL aliquots in 15 mL Falcon tubes and freeze.\nNote: We typically obtain 20 g of washed membranes from 100 g of cells.\nPause point: Membranes can be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for a month at −20°C before proceeding with protein purification, or saved at −80°C for long-time storage.",
    "Optional: An additional wash step in 20 mM NaOH can be added after the urea wash to further remove unwanted proteins. Please be aware that the standard ultracentrifuge tubes may not be compatible with NaOH in which case alternative tubes must be used (see manufacture’s guidelines regarding which tubes are suitable). In our experience, the NaOH wash often does not give any additional improvement in purity of the final human AQP and we most often choose to omit it. However, this should ideally be checked for each new protein.\nPurify AQP from the prepared membranes\nTiming: 3 days\nSince finding the optimal detergent, detergent concentration and solubilization time is crucial for efficient AQP extraction from the P. pastoris membrane, a detergent screen should be performed. If a suitable detergent has already been identified, please proceed to day-2.\nDay-1 Screen for a suitable detergent.\nChoose a set of 5–10 detergents and make stock solutions at 2× final solubilization concentration in 1 mL freshly prepared solubilization-buffer.\nNote: A good starting point for the final concentration is 10× CMC. In our laboratory, our initial screen consists of six detergents: n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM), n-Decyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DM), Octyl β-D glucopyranoside (OG), Nonyl β-D-glucopyranoside (NG), Octyl Glucose Neopentyl Glycol (OGNG) and N-Tetradecyl-N-N-Dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (LDAO) at final concentrations of 1% (w/v), 1% (w/v), 4% (w/v), 2.5% (w/v), 2% (w/v) and 1.5% (w/v) respectively.\nThaw the frozen membranes, if necessary, and aliquot 30 μL of membrane suspension for each detergent in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 30 μL of the 2× detergent stock solution and incubate the tubes at 4°C with gentle shaking for a total duration of 3 h. Collect 10 μL samples after 1 and 2 h.\nSpin down non-solubilized material in a chilled benchtop centrifuge at 15,000 × g and 4°C for 30 min.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a separate tube and mix it with 10 μL 2× SDS loading-buffer.\nAdd 10 μL 2× SDS loading-buffer to the remaining pellet and resuspend it.\nPause point: The samples can be frozen and stored at −20°C for up to a month before further analysis.\nCritical: Do not boil the samples in the SDS loading-buffer before loading on SDS-PAGE for electrophoresis. In our experience, this causes membrane proteins in general and AQPs in particular to aggregate.\nRun a western blot (see “Small-scale screening of AQP expression”, steps 14–22).\nCompare the intensity of the AQP bands in the supernatant and pellet for each detergent in order to estimate the solubilization efficiency, with solubilized AQP being found in the supernatant.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1556-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Purification of human AQPs\n(A) A representative IMAC chromatogram for AQP4. Following a washing step with 75 mM Imidazole, bound his-tagged AQP was eluted using 300 mM Imidazole.\n(B) A representative size-exclusion chromatogram for AQP4 from a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column using a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. UV absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm are shown as dotted and solid lines respectively. The insert shows the SDS-PAGE run of the main elution peak (marked with red a dotted box) showing the typical laddering pattern of AQPs that we obtain using the conditions and material that are standard for SDS-PAGE analysis our laboratory. Note that, in these conditions, we don’t see a band for the AQP4 monomer, however this is most often present for other AQPs.\nNote: Human AQPs produced in P. pastoris often appears as several bands on SDS-PAGE electrophoresis/western blot corresponding to different oligomeric state of the protein (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nDay-2 Solubilize membranes and run IMAC purification.",
    "The protocol below describes the typical FPLC-based purification procedure for human AQPs used in our laboratory and comprises immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The IMAC step may be replaced by an alternative affinity chromatography method or ion exchange chromatography. In the protocol we use OG as detergent but this, as well its concentration, incubation time and temperature, should be replaced with whatever was shown to be most suitable in the detergent screening step above. We recommend running all the chromatography steps at 4°C.\nAlternatives: For the IMAC-step, it is possible to use a gravity flow column (Nyblom et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or a batch protocol (Karlsson et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) instead of the HisTrap protocol described here, in particular when protein yields are very high. However, we find that using an FPLC-system is superior in terms of being able to closely follow the elution and avoid any impurities.\nThaw 10 mL of P. pastoris membranes containing human AQP and transfer to a small beaker. Dropwise add 10 mL of solubilization-buffer containing 8% OG (w/v) (2× final concentration) while stirring gently. Incubate with gentle stirring for 2 h at 4°C.\nDilute the sample with 30 mL of solubilization-buffer and transfer it to ultracentrifuge tubes.\nSpin down insolubilized material at 250,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C using a Beckman Ti70 rotor.\nCritical: After solubilization it is important to dilute the sample immediately after the incubation step in order to reduce the detergent concentration. Longer incubation at high detergent concentration can degrade the protein resulting in lower yield.\nCollect the supernatant and add imidazole to a final concentration of 10 mM.",
    "Critical: Adding imidazole to a final concentration of 10 mM in the supernatant of the solubilized membranes before loading on the column for IMAC helps to reduce the non-specific binding of proteins to the Ni-NTA matrix of the HisTrap column.\nAttach a HisTrap HP 5 mL column to an FLPC-system and equilibrate it with with 25 mL of buffer-A using a flow rate of 1 mL/min or according to the column manufacturer’s instructions.\nAlternatives: HisTrap columns may be run using a peristaltic pump or syringe instead.\nLoad the sample at 0.8 mL/min and continue to run buffer-A at 1 mL/min through the system until the baseline returns to zero.\nWash the column with 15 mL of buffer-B at 1 mL/min flow rate.\nElute the bound proteins with 20 mL of buffer-C at 1 mL/min and collect 1 mL fractions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: We find that the step-wise elution protocol described above works well for the AQPs we have studied so far. However, the imidazole concentration in each step should ideally be experimentally evaluated for every new protein. This can be done by including more steps and imidazole concentrations or by running a gradient elution protocol and carefully evaluating all fractions using SDS-PAGE and, if necessary, Western blot.\nAnalyze the fractions by SDS-PAGE and pool the desired fractions.\nConcentrate to up to 10 mg/mL using a spin concentrator (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) with a molecular weight cut off of 50 kDa.",
    "Critical: Although the AQP tetramer has a molecular weight of ∼120 kDa, it is our experience that using a spin filter with a molecular weight cut off of 50 kDa is helpful to reduce sample loss. In addition, reducing the centrifugation speed and careful pipetting of the sample up and down a couple of times during the concentration step also increases sample yield.\nPause point: After the addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol, the purified protein sample can be aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for a month at −20°C or −80°C for several months before proceeding to the next step.\nCritical: For many membrane proteins, prolonged storage in high imidazole concentration leads to precipitation. In these cases, it is necessary to first remove the imidazole using a desalting column or by directly proceeding to size-exclusion chromatography without freezing the sample. For proteins that are extra sensitive, we recommend to remove the imidazole as soon possible after it has been eluted from the column, even if it is not going to be frozen. In these cases, the most convenient option is to proceed to size exclusion chromatography the same day.\nDay-3 Purify the sample further using size-exclusion chromatography.\nTo further increase sample purity and homogeneity, a size-exclusion chromatography step (SEC) is added after the IMAC. We typically use a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva, US) however this can be exchanged for another size-exclusion column with an appropriate separation range. In addition to serving as a polishing purification step, SEC is an important analytical tool for assessing the presence of aggregates or multiple oligomeric states that may warrant detergent and/or buffer optimization.\nEquilibrate the column with 1.5 column volumes of SEC-buffer.",
    "Inject 500 μL of the concentrated (10 mg/mL) IMAC sample into a 1 mL loop and load the sample on the column.\nCollect the eluate in 1 mL fractions and analyze the interesting fractions by SDS-PAGE.\nNote: The AQP tetramer typically elute at 12–14 mL from a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). If aggregates are present, for example due to the use of non-optimal detergent or buffer conditions, they will elute at the column void volume.\nPool the selected fractions together, and, if necessary, concentrate as above to the desired concentration.\nCritical: It is possible to aliquot, flash-freeze and store the purified protein after SEC. Before freezing, we recommend to add 10% (v/v) glycerol to the purified protein or, alternatively, to include 10% (v/v) glycerol in the SEC buffer. However, up to 50% of the AQP may aggregate at every freeze and thaw procedure. Therefore, it is advisable to refresh the protein after freezing through an additional SEC step before performing follow-up experiments. For proteins that are prone to aggregate during or immediately after purification, we recommend to include 10% (v/v) glycerol in all purification buffers, including IMAC."
