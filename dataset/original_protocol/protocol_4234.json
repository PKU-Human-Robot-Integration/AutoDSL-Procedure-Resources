    "5 µg of the Kernow-C1 p6/luc plasmid is linearized in a 100 µl reaction containing 10 µl of 10x buffer D and 2.5 µl of MluI (10 units/µl) which is incubated at 37 °C for 2 h.The digested DNA is purified using the Qiaquick gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with final elution in 30 µl of buffer EB.Note: To increase the yield, add the recommended amount of isopropanol to the mixture of the reaction and buffer QG. Other methods of DNA purification should be suitable as well.The T7-IRES-FFLuc-YFsfRNA fragment (2.6 kb) is amplified from the pT7-IRES-FFLuc-YFsfRNA plasmid with primers #1 and #2:- 12.5 µl 2x Kapa HiFi HotStart Readymix- 0.75 µl of both primers (dissolved at 10 µM)- < 0.5 µl of plasmid (1-10 ng of DNA)- Ad 25 µl nuclease-free H2OUsing following temperature scheme:- 5 min 95 °C- 20” 98 °C   |- 15” 65 °C   |  x25- 3 min 72 °C|- 5 min 72 °C- 4 °CThe resulting DNA fragment is purified on a 1% agarose gel and extracted with the Qiaquick gel extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with final elution in 30 µl of buffer EB.In vitro transcription reactions are prepared for both DNA fragments with the T7 RiboMAX large scale RNA production system:- 10 µl of 5x T7 transcription buffer- 15 µl of NTPs (ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP; all at 25 mM)- 20 µl of DNA template- 5 µl of enzyme mixReactions are incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. Afterwards, 5 µl of the supplied RQ1 RNase-free DNase solution is added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min.The produced RNA is purified with the RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with elution in 60 µl of RNase-free H2O (in 2 elution of 30 µl each).",
    "RNA concentration is determined by spectroscopy (absorbance at 260 nm).Sixty µg of HEV Kernow-C1 p6/luc RNA is capped with the ScriptCap m7G capping system according to the manufacturer’s instructions.The produced RNA is purified with the RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with elution in 60 µl of RNase-free H2O (in 2 elution of 30 µl each). RNA concentration is determined by spectroscopy (absorbance at 260 nm).Huh7 cells are seeded into a transparent 96-well plate at 104 cells per well in 100 µl of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.Plate is incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h.To transfect one well, 36.5 ng of capped viral RNA and 36.5 ng of FFLuc transfection control RNA are added to 3.65 µl of Opti-MEM. In another tube, 0.365 µl of Lipofectin transfection reagent is added to 3.65 µl Opti-MEM. Both tubes are incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Then, the contents of both tubes are combined and incubated for another 10 min at room temperature. An additional 29.2 µl of Opti-MEM is added and the resulting solution is mixed well.Note: Multiply the indicated amounts and volumes by the number of wells to transfect and prepare an additional 10% extra. For cell control (CC) wells without replicon, viral RNA is omitted.The culture medium is removed from cells seeded earlier and each well is washed with 100 µl of DMEM.Note: Huh7 cells may easily detach from the culture plate, so medium is removed carefully using a pipette instead of a vacuum system.To each well, 36.5 µl of transfection mixture is added.Plate is incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 5 h.Transfection medium is removed from each well and cell layers are washed once with 100 µl of PBS.",
    "One hundred microliters of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS is added to each well. At this step, the compound to be tested is added and an appropriate dilution series is made.Note: No compound is added to virus control (VC) and CC wells.Plate is incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 35 °C for 72 h.Note: Incubation can also be performed at 37 °C if no incubator would be available at 35 °C.From each well, 20 µl is transferred to a white CulturPlate.Renilla luciferase substrate is diluted 1: 100 in assay buffer and 50 µl is added to each well of the CulturPlate containing the transferred culture medium.The plate is shaken vigorously on a plate shaker for a few seconds and luminescence read-out is performed (integration time: 100 ms).Note: The time between substrate addition and read-out has to be kept to a minimum, since background signal will increase over time during the first few minutes. Later on, the overall signal will decline. The remaining medium is removed from each well of the transfected 96-well plate.Passive lysis buffer is diluted 1: 5 in demineralized H2O and 20 µl is added to each well.Plate is shaken at room temperature for 10 min at 500 rpm for proper cell lysis.One hundred microliters of reconstituted Firefly luciferase substrate solution is added to the wells of a new white CulturPlate.All of the cell lysate solution is transferred into the luciferase substrate solution in the CulturPlate.The plate is shaken vigorously on a plate shaker for a few seconds and luminescence read-out is performed as described above.In order to assess compound toxicity, the following assay can be performed:Huh7 cells are seeded as described and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h.",
    "Culture medium is replaced by a compound dilution series in fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (100 µl per well). Plate is incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 35 °C for 72 h.Medium is removed and replaced with 100 µl of a 1: 20 dilution of MTS/PMS solution in colorless MEM per well. Plate is incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C until a brownish color develops (usually this requires incubation for 1-2 h).Absorbance read-out is performed by determining the optical density (OD) at 498 nm (OD of CC should be above 0.6 but below 1 to stay in the linear range)."
