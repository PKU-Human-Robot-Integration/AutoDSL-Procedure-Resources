    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInduction of lysosomal damage\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes induction of lysosomal damage by two methods, pharmacological treatment and beads transfection. L-Leucyl-L-Leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) is one of the lysosomotropic agent which induces membrane permeabilization of lysosomes (Uchimoto et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Polystyrene beads coated with Effectene, a transfection reagent, are known to damage endolysosomes after being endocytosed into cells (Fujita et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nSeed cells onto plates, incubate the cells with 5% CO2 for 18–24 h at 37°C.\nTreat the cells with lysosomal damage inducing reagents. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nLLOMe treatment\nPrepare LLOMe containing culture medium (final concentration is 1 mM).\nCritical: Make sure that LLOMe dissolved in EtOH completely before use, it sometimes crystallizes.\nWash the cells with PBS once.\nNote: Do not use ice cold PBS during cell culture.\nAdd LLOMe containing medium to the cells, incubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nRemove the medium from the cells, wash the cells gently with PBS once.\nAdd the fresh medium to the cells, incubate for 3 h at 37°C.\nBead transfection\nMix the 2 μL beads and 1 μL Effectene (Qiagen Cat# 301425) transfection reagent in 100 μL Buffer PC.\nIncubate transfection reagent-coated beads for 20 min at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd the 1 mL growth medium to the bead mixture.\nRemove the medium from the cells, add to resulting bead mixture to the cells.\nIncubate the cells for 3 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator.\nWash the cells with PBS twice to remove attached beads to the extracellular.\nCritical: Cell cultures containing reagent-coated beads must remain to stand still in order for the beads that fall on the cells to be taken up into the cells (step 2-b-v).\nAssessment of the lysosomal damage using microscopy\nTiming: 2–3 days",
    "This step describes verification of lysosomal damage by observing Galectin3 (Gal3) puncta. Gal3, one of the beta-galactoside binding lectins, binds to glycans in the lumen of endocytic compartments including lysosomes. Gal3 can be useful for a marker of damaged lysosomes, since it can bind to glycans only when endolysosomal membrane is ruptured (Maejima et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Before proceeding to the monitor TFEB activity, we recommend checking whether lysosomes are actually damaged in the experimental condition by this assay. Once confirming the lysosomal damage, step3 to 20 can be omitted accordingly (see also a flowchart in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPlace sterile coverslips (12 mm in diameter) into a sterile cell culture plate (for 6-well plate, 4 to 5 coverslips/well).\nCoat coverslips with collagen; Cellmatrix (Nitta Gelatin, 631-00771) diluted by 10 times with sterile water, incubate the plate at least 30 min at 37°C.\nWash coverslips with PBS twice.\nSeed cells onto collagen coated plate, incubate the cells with 5% CO2 for 18–24 h at 37°C.\nCritical: The cells should be seeded to become below 70% confluent at the next day (In the case of HeLa cells, 2.0×105 cells/well).\nTreat the cells with lysosomal damage inducing reagents as described in step 2a or 2b.\nWash the cells with PBS once.\nFix the cells with ice cold 4% PFA, incubate the cells for 20 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the cells with PBS twice.\nPause point: After fixation, the cells can be stored in PBS at 4°C within 1 week.\nPermeabilize the samples with 50 μg/mL Digitonin-PBS solution for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the samples with PBS twice\nIncubate with 0.1% gelatin-PBS for 30 min at 20°C–25°C .\nWash the samples with PBS twice.\nIncubate with the primary antibodies (anti-Gal3 and anti-Lamp1 antibodies) diluted in 0.1% gelatin-PBS for 1h at 20°C–25°C .",
    "Wash the samples with PBS twice.\nIncubate with secondary antibodies diluted in 0.1% gelatin-PBS for 40 min, in the dark at 20°C–25°C .\nWash the samples with PBS and ddH2O for three times (PBS twice → ddH2O once).\nMount the samples with a drop of mounting media with DAPI onto glass slide. Remove excess media and seal the coverslips with nail polish.\nPause point: After mounting, samples can be stored within one month in the dark at 4°C.\nObserve the samples by confocal microscopy. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nCritical: After wash, drain excess PBS or ddH2O from coverslips with paper towel to avoid carryover to following steps.\nCritical: Keep samples from drying out, which cause enhancement of background signal.\nMonitor and analysis of TFEB nuclear translocation using microscopy\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes observation of TFEB nuclear translocation by microscopy and following quantification of nuclei/cytoplasm ratio using CellProfiler software. This is the free open-source software for analysis of imaging data.\nNote: Because the expression level of endogenous TFEB is low, it is recommended to use the cells in which fluorescent protein tagged TFEB is stably expressed for observation of TFEB nuclear translocation by microscopy. In the protocol described below, HeLa cells expressing TFEB-mNeonGreen are used.\nNote: It is better to adjust the expression of exogenous TFEB at the same level within the cells by FACS.\nPlace sterile coverslips (12 mm in diameter) into a sterile cell culture plate (for 6-well plate, 4 to 5 coverslips/well).\nCoat coverslips with Cellmatrix diluted by 10 times with sterile water, incubate the plate at least 30 min at 37°C.\nWash coverslips with PBS twice.\nSeed cells onto collagen coated plate, incubate the cells with 5% CO2 for 18–24 h at 37°C.",
    "Critical: The cells should be seeded to become below 70% confluent at the next day (In the case of HeLa cells, 2.0×105 cells/well). It is difficult to distinguish each cell in the images of high confluency by CellProfiler.\nInduce lysosomal damage by LLOMe or beads transfection as described in step 2a or 2b.\nWash the cells with PBS once.\nFix the cells with ice cold 4% PFA, incubate the cells for 20 min at 20°C–25°C .\nWash the samples with PBS and ddH2O for three times (PBS twice → ddH2O once).\nMount the samples with a drop of mounting media with DAPI onto glass slide. Remove excess media and seal the coverslips with nail polish.\nObserve the cell using widefield fluorescence microscopy, take images of the cells (images of DAPI and TFEB).\nNote: More than 100 cells/sample are required for the following analysis.\nQuantify the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio of TFEB using CellProfiler software. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nIdentify the nuclei from DAPI images by following modules.\nSmooth: Smoothing DAPI images.\nIdentifyPrimaryObjects: Identify the regions of nuclei from smoothed DAPI images, name these primary objects <Nuclei>.\nIdentify the cells from TFEB images based on <Nuclei> by following modules.\nSmooth: Smoothing TFEB images.\nIdentifySecondaryObjects: Identify the regions of cells from smoothed TFEB images, name these secondary objects <Cells>. Also, name the primary objects which have matched secondary objects <filtered Nuclei>.\nIdentify the cytoplasm from TFEB images by following module.\nIdentifyTertiaryObjects: Identify the regions of cytoplasm by subtracting the nuclei objects <filtered Nuclei> from the cell objects <Cells>, name these tertiary objects <Cytoplasm>.\nMeasure intensity of TFEB in nuclei and cytoplasm by following module.\nMeasureObjectIntensity: Measure intensity of <filtered Nuclei> and <Cytoplasm>.\nCalculate the ratio of intensity between nuclei and cytoplasm TFEB by following module.",
    "CalculateMath: Divide the mean intensity of <filtered Nuclei> by the mean intensity of <Cytoplasm>.\nMonitor of nuclear translocation of TFEB by western blotting\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step describes observation phosphorylate state or subcellular localization of TFEB by immunoblotting.\nUnder normal conditions, TFEB is phosphorylated at multiple sites, including the S211 site, by mTOR and other protein kinases and is present in the cytoplasm (Puertollano et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), and TFEB is detected as a single band in immunoblotting. Upon starvation or lysosomal damage, some sites of TFEB are dephosphorylated (including the site of S211) and translocated to the nucleus, and TFEB is detected as a smear band in immunoblotting.\nSample preparation\nTiming: 2 days\nSeed cells to a sterile cell culture plate, incubate the cells with 5% CO2 for 18–24 h at 37°C.\nTreat the cells with LLOMe or transfection reagent coated beads.\nWash the cells with ice-cold PBS twice.\nNote: The cells grow until 70–80% confluence.\nPrepare sample for immunoblotting.\nPreparation of total cell lysate\nSuspend the ice-cold cells in the 200 μL (for 1 well in 6-well dish) M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for total cell lysate. Incubate cell lysates for 10 min on ice.\nCentrifugate the cell lysates at 15,000 × g for 10 min and collect the supernatant.\nAdd the 5× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95°C.\nThe samples are used for standard method of SDS-PAGE and western blotting.\nFractionation of cytosolic fraction and nuclear fraction Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]\nSuspend the ice-cold cells in the 300 μL (for 1 well in 6-well dish) PBS containing 0.1% NP-40, protease and phosphatase inhibitors as lysis buffer. Incubate cell lysates for 10 min on ice.",
    "Centrifugate the cell lysates at 9,100 × g for 10 sec, and take 100 μL supernatant (cytosolic fraction).\nRemove supernatant and wash the pellet with the 300 μL PBS containing 0.1% NP-40.\nCentrifugate the cell lysates at 10,000 rpm for 10 sec and remove supernatant.\nAdd the 200 μL PBS containing 0.1% NP-40 (nuclear fraction) and mix 5× SDS sample buffer and boil for 5 min at 95°C.\nThe fractionation samples are used for standard method of SDS-PAGE and western blotting.\nSDS-PAGE of the sample of total cell lysate and fractionation\nTiming: 2 days\nLoad equal amounts (about 20–30 μg of total protein) of above samples and molecular weight marker into the wells of the SDS-PAGE gel.\nCritical: The samples load into 8% polyacrylamide gels to separate phospho-TFEB protein.\nThe loaded gels run for 1–1.5 h at 20 mA per a mini gel.\nTransfer the protein from the gel to the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane.\nIncubate the membranes with blocking solution (TBST containing 1% skim milk) for 30 min at 20°C–25°C.\nIncubate the membranes with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 16–24 h at 4°C.\nNote: In the immunoblotting using fractionation sample, we recommend detecting loading controls. In this protocol, we detect Lamin B (control for nuclear fraction) and GAPDH (control for cytoplasmic fraction).\nWash the membranes with TBST (5 min ×3).\nIncubate the membranes with 5,000× dilutions of HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 1h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the membranes with TBST (5 min ×3).\nDetect the immunoreactive bands using luminescent regents on a ChemiDoc Touch imaging system (Bio-Rad).
