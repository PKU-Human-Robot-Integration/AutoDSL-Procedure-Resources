  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All 96-well sitting-drop crystallization experiments were setup using either 2 or 3-drop plates. A liquid handling robot and a crystallization imager/hotel were used to facilitate the preparation and monitoring of all 96-well screens. All reagent concentrations for crystallization experiments are given at their starting concentrations prior to mixing.\n1. Optimizing crystal morphology\nNOTE: Steps 1.1.1. and 1.1.6. describe how endothiapepsin crystallization conditions were found, and how these conditions were optimized to find a single condition that yielded single, well-diffracting crystals.\nSparse-matrix optimization\nPrepare fresh endothiapepsin solution.\n\t\t​NOTE: Endothiapepsin, when procured as Superan 600, must be buffer transferred out of its storage solution and concentrated.\n\t\t\nPrepare 3 L of 0.1 M Na Acetate pH 4.6 at 4 °C.\nCut 20 cm of dialysis tubing and briefly wash in the buffer. Seal one end of the tubing using a clip, place 50 mL of the endothiapepsin solution into the tubing and then seal the other end.\nLeave the solution to dialyze for at least 4 h (or overnight) at 4 °C in 1 L of the Na Acetate buffer. Due to the components of the storage buffer, the solution in the dialysis bag will now be approximately 100 mL.\nTransfer the dialysis bag containing the endothiapepsin into a fresh liter of 4 °C, 0.1 M Na Acetate pH 4.6. Repeat this step once more such that the original buffer has been diluted 2000x against the Na Acetate.\nThe endothiapepsin will now be at approximately 10 mg/mL. Concentrate to 100 mg/mL using a 10 kDa centrifugal concentrator and a centrifuge.\nFlash cool the endothiapepsin solution in liquid nitrogen in 50 µL aliquots and store at -80 °C.\nPrepare a PACT Premier 96-well sparse-matrix screen.",
    "Using a liquid handling robot, dispense 100 nL of 70 mg/mL endothiapepsin and 100 nL of well solution into a single sub-well per well. Mix the protein and well solution 3 times upon addition of the crystallization buffer.\nSeal the plate and leave for 28 days at 20 °C taking images every day for the first week and then every week thereafter for 4 weeks.\nSparse-matrix analysis\nIdentify hits that produce single endothiapepsin crystals. From the PACT screen, conditions that contained MgCl2 grew as singletons rather than needle clusters.\nSparse-matrix optimization\nFrom the MgCl2 containing conditions identified in Step 1.1.3.1, create a 96-well screen randomly combining and varying the different well components.\nUsing a liquid handling robot, dispense 100 nL of 70 mg/mL endothiapepsin and 100 nL of well solution into a single sub-well per well. Mix the protein and well solution 3 times upon addition of the crystallization buffer.\nSeal the plate and leave for 28 days at 20 °C taking images every day for the first week and then every week thereafter for 4 weeks.\nOptimization analysis\nUsing suitable spreadsheet software, rank the crystallization conditions that give rise to crystals based on the crystal quality and precipitation level, no crystals (0) to ideal (5) and low (0) to high (5), respectively. With respect to crystal quality, the broad criteria are single crystals with a box-like morphology.\nPerform a Pearson's correlation analysis between the crystallization condition contents and the crystal quantity and precipitation level.\nPlot these data as a heat map. Look for components and conditions that were correlated with the preferred outcomes.\nDiffraction analysis.\nConfirm that the crystals grown from the identified conditions in Step 1.1.5 are suitable for serial crystallography by performing an X-ray diffraction experiment.",
    "Load a sample of the endothiapepsin crystals from each of the identified conditions onto supports that allow for data collection at either 100 or 293 K and perform an X-ray diffraction experiment. If working under cryo, use 25% ethylene glycol as the cryo-protectant.\nProcess these data via a suitable software suite. Endothiapepsin crystals should diffract to beyond 1.5 Å. Check for twinning, as twinned crystals can significantly complicate serial crystallographic data processing.\nIf crystals are singletons and diffract to 1.5 Å proceed to Step 2. If not, go back to Step 1.1.2 and try more sparse-matrix screens to identify promising conditions. After the analyses conducted in Steps 1.1.5. and 1.1.6., a crystallization condition of 25% (w/v) PEG 6,000, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0 and 0.15 M MgCl2 should have been found as the approximate ideal.\n2. Transitioning to batch\nMorphogram experiment\nCreate a micro-crystal seed stock.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is best practice when making seed-stocks, to make the seeds from crystals specifically grown for the task. This greatly helps with reproducibility. Other ideas presented in Steps 2.1.1.1 to 2.1.1.11 are to always use the crystals grown from a standard number of wells - here 5 - and aliquot the stocks once they are made to negate freeze-thaw cycles.\n\t\t\nPrepare a 96-well crystallization plate with wells containing the crystallization buffer: 25% (w/v) PEG 6,000, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0 and 0.15 M MgCl2.\nUsing a liquid handling robot, dispense 200 nL of defrosted 70 mg/mL endothiapepsin and 200 nL of well solution into a single sub-well per well. Mix the protein and well solution 3 times upon addition of the crystallization buffer.\nSeal the plate and leave for 24 h.",
    "Fill a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube with 250 µL of crystallization buffer and 10-15 1 mm glass beads. Leave the centrifuge tube on ice to cool for 5-10 min.\nSelect 5 wells with crystals, open the wells with a scalpel and, using a pipette tip, crush the crystals in the wells.\nAspirate 1 µL of buffer from the iced centrifuge tube and use to homogenize the crushed crystal slurry. Once homogeneous, aspirate the entire slurry and collect in the cooled centrifuge tube.\nRepeat Step 2.1.2.6 for each of the 5 sub-wells.\nVortex the centrifuge tube containing the buffer, pooled slurries and beads at 1000 rpm for 30 s.\nReturn the centrifuge tube to ice for 30 s.\nRepeat Steps 2.1.2.8 and 2.1.2.9 two more times.\nThe seed-stock is now ready and can be aliquoted into 10 µL batches and stored at -20 °C.\nPerform morphogram experiment.\nPrepare a 2-drop 96-well grid screen. Vary the concentration of PEG 6,000 from 5 to 40% (w/v) along the plate columns, keeping the buffer and salt at 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0 and 0.15 M MgCl2, respectively.\nPrepare a sequential dilution of endothiapepsin in 0.1 M Na Acetate pH 4.6 from 100 to 12.5 mg/mL over 8 steps. A different concentration of endothiapepsin will be used for each row of the plate.\nUsing a liquid handling robot, dispense 150 nL of endothiapepsin into both sub-wells 1 and 2. In sub-well 1, dispense 150 nL of the well solution. In sub-well 2, multi-aspirate 50 nL of defrosted seed-stock and 100 nL of well solution, and then dispense both into the protein solution. Mix the solutions 3 times upon addition of the crystallization buffer.",
    "Seal the plate and leave at 20 °C taking images every 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 h, then every day for the first week, and every week for the next four. If automatic imaging is not possible, do not worry about the hourly imaging on day 1.\nMorphogram analysis\nLooking at the images taken after 24 h, estimate the number of crystals that are present in each well and record these estimates in the \"morphogram generator\" worksheet provided. These estimates do not have to be precise; individually counting thousands of micro-crystals, if present, is not practical or necessary. Principally try to ensure the estimates are consistent over the whole plate.\n\t\t​NOTE: The 24 h rule was based upon the observations made in Beale et al. (2019)26. Vapor diffusion crystallization conditions can take days or weeks to equilibrate. Crystals that appear rapidly are more likely to have grown via a batch process rather than by the gradual equilibration of the drop components. The 24 h criterion is, therefore, somewhat arbitrary and an exact cut-off time between a batch and vapor diffusion experiment will depend on the specific mixture of the condition [see Beale et al. (2019)26 for full details].\nInput the starting concentrations of endothiapepsin and PEG 6,000 in the boxes indicated.\nThe worksheet will automatically plot the results in the traditional phase diagram format with precipitant and protein concentration on the x and y axes, respectively. Well conditions that only give rise to crystals in their seeded drops indicate the metastable region of the diagram (transparent blue), whereas conditions that have crystals in both the seeded and non-seeded drops indicate the nucleation zone (solid green).",
    "​NOTE: Ideally, the majority of the nucleation zone should be present on the diagram (i.e., there are some clear wells on the bottom of the diagram and some precipitate should be visible at high protein and precipitant concentrations). If this is not the case, perhaps, repeat the experiment but increase the protein and/or precipitant concentration (if possible).\nIf crystal have appeared in less than 24 h, proceed to Step 2.3.1. If not, proceed to Step 2.4 and continue optimizing towards batch.\nCrystal analysis\nAs said at the end of Step 1, before moving to the next step, ensure these crystals have the desired morphology and diffraction quality. With regard to morphology, are the crystals observably untwinned and forming as singletons rather than needle-ball-like or fan-like structures? With regard to diffraction, collect diffraction data from the crystals if possible. If these crystals do not diffract, it is improbable that the crystals grown in a larger volume will diffract.\nLoad a sample of the endothiapepsin crystals from the morphogram experiment onto supports that allow for data collection at either 100 or 293 K and perform an X-ray diffraction experiment. If working under cryo, use 25% ethylene glycol as the cryo-protectant.\nProcess these data via a suitable software suite. Endothiapepsin crystals should diffract to beyond 1.5 Å. Across the sample of crystals, observe the cell size, the total number of observations, and the mosaicity; these measures will give an indication as to the homogeneity of the diffracting crystals.\nIf the crystal morphology and diffraction quality is sufficient, proceed to Step 3.\nOptimize crystal growth time.",
    "NOTE: The morphogram analysis (Step 2.2) will have given an indication of the crystallization starting point (i.e., the region of the phase diagram where the drop is located when the precipitant and protein solutions were mixed). Is the drop in the metastable region or below the solubility line? Batch crystallization begins in the nucleation zone (Figure 1C). The goal of this step is to move this starting point from either below the solubility line or metastable region, into the nucleation zone (Figure 1D). If the seeded-drops from Step 2.2. have yielded crystals rapidly, this is an indication that the drop mixture is already in the metastable region, if not, then it is likely the drop is not supersaturated.\n\t\nOptimizing crystal growth time.\nUsing the same screen as in Step 2.1.3, prepare a 96-well vapor diffusion crystallization experiment in a 3-drop plate.\nIncrease the starting protein concentration of endothiapepsin on the y axis (i.e., concentrate the protein further, perhaps 120 mg/mL for endothiapepsin).\nPerform a serial dilution, as in Step 2.1.3.2, such that each row of the plate contains a sequentially lower protein concentration.\nUse different drop ratios in each of the three drops on the plate: 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1, protein:precipitant.\nView or image the plate on the first day at 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 h and then every day for the first week, and every week for the next four. If automatic imaging is not possible, do not worry about the hourly imaging on day 1.\nIdentify drops that produce the most rapidly appearing crystals and makes these the starting points of repeated optimizations until crystal growth occurs within 24 h.\nWhen a rapidly appearing crystal-condition has been identified return to Step 2.1 to replot the morphogram as a prelude to begin scaling.\n3. Scaling",
    "Rank scaling routes. At this stage, it is not necessary to decide on a single scaling route, only to identify and rank the options so that they can be explored in turn. As the volume of the batch mixture is increased during the scaling procedure, changes will occur in the rate of nucleation and the range of crystal sizes. However, these can be overcome by careful tweaking of component concentrations as the scaled volume is increased.\n\t​NOTE: Steps 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 describe how to discern, from the morphogram, whether a batch or seeded-batch protocol is more appropriate.\n\t\nStraight batch protocol\nIs the Xn in the nucleation zone proportional to the protein and/or precipitant concentration? I.e. does Xn increase as a function of either precipitant and/or protein concentration? - Yes? Go to Step 3.1.1.2. No? Go to Step 3.1.2.\nLocate conditions that yield crystals of the required size and go to Step 3.2.\nSeeded-batch protocol\nIs the Xn flat across the nucleation zone? I.e., Xn does not increase as a function of either precipitant and/or protein concentration.\nLocate seeded conditions that yield crystals of the required size and go to Step 3.2. If all crystals are too large - go to Step 3.1.2.3.\nRepeat the morphogram experiment (Step 2.1) but this time increase the concentration of the seed-stock used in the seeded wells. The seed stock can be increased by using more crystals in its creation. For example, instead of 5 wells in Step 2.1.1.5, use 10 wells.\nView or image the plate over the first 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 h.\nThe Xn should have increased and the Xs decreased in the seeded-drops. Repeat this cycle if smaller crystals are needed and then follow a seeded-batch protocol.\nGradually scaling",
    "Scaling in 96-well plates. From the endothiapepsin morphogram, a straight batch method using the crystallization condition 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.15 M MgCl2, and 30% (w/v) PEG 6,000, was initially selected for scaling. 100 mg/mL endothiapepsin mixed with the crystallization buffer in a 1:1 ratio.\n\t\t\nPrepare 2-3 wells in a 2-well 96-well sitting-drop plate with 100 µL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.15 M MgCl2, and 30% (w/v) PEG 6,000.\nUsing freshly defrosted 100 mg/mL endothiapepsin solution, dispense 0.5 µL of protein and 0.5 µL precipitant per well, seal and store at 20°C.\nView or image the plate over the first 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 h. Note any changes in the range of Xs and Xn.\nIf changes have occurred, repeat Steps 3.2.1.1 to 3.2.1.2 but increase or decrease the protein, precipitant, and/or seed concentration to restore any changes to the range of Xs and Xn.\nWhen the range of Xs and Xn are acceptable, proceed to Step 3.2.2.\nScaling in 24-well hanging-drop plates\nPrepare a single well of a 24-well hanging-drop plate by greasing the edges of the well with vacuum grease.\nPrepare 0.5 mL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.15 M MgCl2, and 30% (w/v) PEG 6,000 and fill the greased well.\nUsing freshly defrosted endothiapepsin solution, pipette 1 µL of protein onto the surface of a glass coverslip. Pipette 1 µL of crystallization buffer onto the protein drop and mix using the pipette.\nView or image the plate over the first 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 h. Note any changes in the range of Xs and Xn.\nIf changes have occurred, repeat Steps 3.2.2.1 to 3.2.2.4 but increase or decrease the protein, precipitant, and/or seed concentration to restore any changes to the range of Xs and Xn.",
    "When/if the range of Xs and Xn are acceptable, proceed to Step 3.2.2.7.\nRepeat Steps 3.2.2.1 to 3.2.2.5, increasing the total volume of the experiment gradually to 10 µL.\nOnce at a volume of 10 µL or larger, proceed to centrifuge tubes in Step 3.2.3.\nScaling in centrifuge tubes\n\t\tNOTE: The refinement of the endothiapepsin batch condition principally happened at the point of 200 µL volumes (see Results, Scaling). The process began with a crystallization condition of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.15 M MgCl2, and 30% (w/v) PEG 6,000. However, the PEG concentration ultimately changed to 40% (w/v). Seeds were also required to control the Xn, and to prevent crystals growing too large, crystal growth had to be quenched. Steps 3.2.3.1 to 3.2.3.7 detail the process of condition optimization. Step 3.2.4. describe the final batch protocol.\n\t\t\nPrepare 1 mL crystallization buffer: 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.15 M MgCl2, and 30% (w/v) PEG 6,000.\nUsing freshly defrosted 100 mg/mL endothiapepsin add 25 µL of protein to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nThoroughly mix the crystallization buffer with the protein solution in a 1:1 ratio with a pipette tip. Place the tube in a revolver/rotator with high agitation at 20 °C.\nTake regular (5, 10, 30, 60 min, 2, 5, 10, 24 h) 2.5 µL aliquots and view in a hemocytometer. Record the Xn and the Xs range.\nIf changes have occurred, repeat Steps 3.2.3.1. to 3.2.3.4. but increase or decrease the protein, precipitant, and/or seed concentration to restore any changes to the range of Xs and Xn\nWhen the range of Xs and Xn are acceptable, proceed to Step 3.2.3.7.\nRepeat Steps 3.2.2.1 to 3.2.2.5, increasing the total volume of the experiment gradually to 200 µL or larger, as required.\nFinal seeded-batch protocol\nPrepare seed-stock.",
    "Prepare 2 mL of crystallization buffer: 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.15 M MgCl2, and 40% (w/v) PEG 6,000.\nUsing freshly defrosted 100 mg/mL endothiapepsin add 100 µL of protein to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nThoroughly mix the crystallization buffer with the protein solution in a 1:1 ratio with a pipette tip. Place the tube in a revolver/rotator with high agitation at 20 °C for 24 h to allow 50 µm crystals to grow.\nAdd 10-15 1 mm glass beads to the 50 µm crystal slurry.\nVortex the centrifuge tube containing the slurry and beads at 1000 rpm for 30 s.\nReturn the centrifuge tube to ice for 30 s.\nRepeat Steps 3.2.4.1.5 and 3.2.4.1.6 10 more times.\nThis is now 200 µL of a 1x seed-stock. Dilute the seed-stock 10x by the addition of 1.8 mL of crystallization buffer. Aliquot the 10x seed-stock in 50 µL batches and store at -20 °C.\nSeeded-batch protocol.\nPrepare crystallization buffer: 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.15 M MgCl2, and 40% (w/v) PEG 6,000.\nIn a centrifuge tube, mix 100 µL of crystallization buffer with the 50 µL of freshly defrosted 10x seed-stock.\nUsing freshly defrosted 100 mg/mL endothiapepsin add 150 µL of protein to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nThoroughly mix the crystallization buffer/seed mixture with the endothiapepsin solution with a pipette tip and place the tube in a revolver/rotator with high agitation at 20 °C.\nMonitor the crystallization by taking regular 2.5 µL aliquots and view the crystals in a hemocytometer. Record the Xn and the Xs range.",
    "After approximately 80 min, when the crystals have reached an Xs of 15 µm, quench the reaction by the addition of 150 µL of 0.05 M Na Acetate pH 4.6, 0.05 M Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.075 M MgCl2, and 20% (w/v) PEG 6,000 (a solution composed of endothiapepsin buffer and crystallization buffer, mixed 1:1).\nStore the crystals at 20 °C.\nHas the protocol produced an acceptable crystal size range and number for the intended experiment? Yes - DONE- No - return to Step 3.1. and attempt an alternative scaling option. For example, a different protein:precipitant ratio may be possible or adding seeds if this was not done previously. When these are all exhausted, it might be necessary to find a new condition at Step 1."
