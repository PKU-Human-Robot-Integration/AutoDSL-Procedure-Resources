A workflow of Huntingtin protein expression and purification\nDH10Bac transformation\nTiming: 4 days\nGenerate DH10Bac strains containing the bacmid inserted with the HTT cDNA.\nAdd 100 ng of pFastBac1 plasmid containing the full-length HTT cDNA to 100 μL of DH10Bac™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) competent cells.\nNote: Mix gently. Do not pipet.\nIncubate the cells on ice for 30 min.\nHeat-shock at 42°C for 45 s.\nIncubate the cells on ice again for 2 min.\nAdd 900 μL of S.O.C. medium to the cells and incubate at 37°C for 4 h in a shaking incubator.\nPrepare a series of 10×, 100×, and 1000× diluted cells with S.O.C. medium.\nPlate 100 μL of each diluted cell sample on DH10Bac LB agar plates.\nIncubate the plates for 2 days at 37°C in an incubator.\nPick 3–4 white colonies and restreak them onto new DH10Bac LB agar plates.\nNote: This step is essential to distinguish true white colonies from blue colonies.\nNote: If it is difficult to distinguish between blue and white colonies due to the light blue color of some colonies, refer to the troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nIncubate the restreaked plates for 2 days at 37°C.\nNote: The resteaked plates can be stored at 4°C for 2–3 days.\nCritical: Do not store the plate more than 2 days. Use fresh colonies for bacmid purification. This step substantially affects the quality of the viruses and protein production.\nInoculate a single white colony into 5 mL of DH10Bac LB medium.\nNote: We usually grow 3–5 cultures from several single white colonies.\nIncubate for 2 days at 37°C in a shaking incubator.\nBacmid isolation and analysis\nTiming: 10 h",
    "Isolate bacmid from the culture of the selected white colony and confirm the HTT cDNA transposition into the bacmid using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\nNote: We use Sol I, Sol II and Sol III buffers from the Plasmid DNA Purification Kit Mini (Labopass)\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 3,000×g for 20 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 300 μL of Sol I buffer.\nAdd 300 μL of Sol II buffer and mix gently by inverting. Incubate the sample at room temperature (RT; 20°C–24°C) for 5 min.\nAdd 300 μL of Sol III buffer to the mixture and gently mix by inverting. Incubate the sample on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the sample at 17,000×g for 20 min at 4°C.\nTransfer 750 μL of the supernatant to 800 μL of 100% isopropanol and mix gently the sample by inverting. Incubate the sample on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the incubated sample at 17,000×g for 20 min at RT.\nNote: After step #19, a white DNA pellet should be observed at the bottom of the tube.\nDecant the supernatant and add 1 mL of 70% ethanol on the top of the white pellet. Wash the pellet by inverting the tube.\nCentrifuge the sample at 17,000×g for 5 min at RT.\nAfter centrifugation, remove the supernatant with a pipet without disturbing the pellet. Dry the white DNA pellet with airdry while the tubes are upside-down on a Kimwipe until the white pellet becomes transparent.\nNote: If the white pellet does not become transparent and stays white, it is an indication of impure bacmid. Refer to the troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nDissolve the transparent DNA pellet by adding 40 μL of TE buffer. Resuspend the DNA pellet gently by tapping. Do not use a pipette.",
    "Note: Store the bacmid at 4°C, and use the bacmid within a day.\nNote: In general, the concentration of DNA (bacmid) is ∼4 μg/μL in 40 μl TE (total 160 μg).\nNote: The purity of the bacmid can be monitored by the A260/A280 ratio. The A260/A280 ratio of the bacmid should be approximately 2.\nPerform PCR using the M13 forward and hHTT R146 primers (the sequences of each primer are described in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The PCR product should appear at approximately 2.9 kbp when the HTT c cDNA is properly integrated into bacmids.\nNote: Refer to Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1103_11.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1103_12.csv\naDepending on the number of CAG repeats, add extra min for extension (α=0.18 s per one CAG repeat).\nGenerating and amplify baculovirus\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nTransfect the bacmid into Sf9 cells to generate baculovirus and amplify the baculovirus for large scale infection to produce HTT proteins.\nPlate 1.0×106 Sf9 cells in 2 mL CCM3 media (0.5×106 cells/mL) into each well in a 6-well plate.\nNote: Sf9 cells were used in the log phase of the growth where the cell density was between 2–4×106.\nIncubate the cells to attach to the bottom of the plate at 27°C for 1 h.\nWhile the cells attach to the plate, prepare 1 μg of bacmid in 100 μL of CCM3 media and 6 μL of Cellfectin II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 100 μL of CCM3 media separately.\nCombine the bacmid in CCM3 and the Cellfectin II in CCM3 from step #27, and mix gently by inverting. Incubate the mixture for 45 min at RT.\nRemove the medium from each well from step #26 and add 2 mL of fresh CCM medium to each well.",
    "After incubating the mixture of bacmid and Cellfectin II at step #28, add 800 μL of fresh CCM medium to the mixture and mix gently by inverting.\nRemove the medium from each well again from step #29 and add the bacmid-Cellfectin II mixture (∼1 mL) to the cells. Incubate the plate at 27°C for 5 h.\nNote: Ensure that one well remains as a negative control without bacmid at step #27–28.\nAfter 5 h, remove the medium and add 2 mL of fresh CCM media to each well, and incubate the plate at 27°C for 3 days.\nNote: The media loss by evaporation during incubation can be prevented by incubating the cell plate in a sealed chamber such as a Ziploc container with wet Kimwipes.\nAfter 3 days, collect the medium containing baculovirus from the wells and filter the medium by using a 0.22 μm syringe filter (Sartorius). This is a P1 virus stock.\nNote: The volume of P1 virus stock is approximately around 1.5 mL.\nNote: We do not observe clear indication of the infection such as enlarged cells and detached cells, at this stage.\nPlate 5×106 Sf9 cells in 10 mL into a 75 cm2 cell culture T-flask (or 10 cm2 cell culture dish). Wait for 30 min to let the cells attach to the bottom of the plate. Add 50 μL of the harvested P1 virus from step #33 to the cells. Shake gently the flask to mix the virus in the cell media.\nNote: As a control, leave at least one plate of cells without baculovirus.\nIncubate the flask at 27°C for 3–5 days",
    "Critical: We recommend checking the condition of the infected cells compared with the control to confirm baculovirus infection. The infected Sf9 cells should become enlarged and detached from the plates especially during P2 and P3 virus generation, but not necessarily during P1 generation. Please see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for representative images. Refer to the troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1103-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative images of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells\n(A and B) Images of Sf9 cells were taken under a light-microscopy after 5 days of post-infection of P2 baculovirus. The infected cells (B) are enlarged compared with the control cells (A).\nCollect and filter using Steriflip filter unit (Merck Millipore). This is a P2 virus stock.\nPlate 15×106 Sf9 cells in 25 mL (final 0.6×106 cells/mL) into 150 cm2 cell culture dish. Wait for 30 min to let the cells attach to the bottom of the dish. In addition, add 50 μL of the P2 virus to cells.\nNote: As a control, leave at least one culture dish of cells without baculovirus.\nIncubation at 27°C for 5–6 days.\nCritical: You should observe that most of the cells become enlarged and are floating in the media as the cells are detached. If the cells are not sufficiently detached, incubate 1–2 more days.\nAs there are a lot of cells in the media, centrifuge the media at 4,000×g for 10 min and collect the media.\nFilter the media using 0.22 μm bottle top filters (PES, Corning). This is a P3 virus stock.\nNote: We usually make 50 mL of P2 and 500 mL of P3.\nNote: Store the virus at 4°C and protect it from light.\nNote: The virus can be stored for one month without affecting the level of protein expression.\nLarge-scale protein expression\nTiming: 3 days",
    "Infect baculovirus into Sf9 cells to express HTT proteins.\nNote: This protocol is based on a purification procedure from 8 L of Sf9 cell culture.\nPrepare cells (final density of cells in 1,000 mL media: 1.0–1.5×106 cells/mL) in 1,000 mL of CCM3 media in a 2,800 mL Fernbach flask a day before the large-scale infection.\nNote: We dilute Sf9 cells on a large scale from Sf9 cells at 6–8×106 cells/mL.\nIncubate the cell until 2.0–2.5×106 cells/mL density at 27°C with 100 rpm in an orbital shaker incubator.\nNote: Typically, it will take 24 h to reach 2.0×10 6 cells/mL from 1.0×106 cells/mL at 27°C at 100 rpm in an INFORS HT shaking incubator\nWhen the proper cell density is reached, add 50 mL of the P3 virus to 1,000 mL of the cells in a 2,800 mL Fernbach flask.\nIncubate at 27°C for 42–48 h.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 4,600×g for 20 min at 4°C.\nDecant the medium and resuspend the cell pellet with 30 mL of the cell harvest buffer for the cells from 1,000 mL of cell culture.\nNote: Ensure that 1 mM PMSF and final 1× Protease inhibitor Cocktail are added to the cell harvest buffer before use.\nCritical: Before resuspending the cells, wash the surface of the cell pellet with the cell harvest buffer. This step is important to reduce the degradation of HTT proteins.\nFreeze the resuspended cells in liquid nitrogen and store them at −80°C.\nFLAG affinity chromatography\nTiming: 9 h\nIsolate the recombinant FLAG tag-HTT with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel from cell lysate.\nCritical: From this step, perform all steps at 4°C.\nThe resuspended cells were lysed by repeatedly freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen and in a water bath at 25°C for 3 times.",
    "Note: No other reagent such as DNase is necessary for cell lysis.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate at 27,000×g for 2 h using 50 mL centrifuge tubes.\nNote: If the supernatant is still turbid after this step, centrifuge again with the same condition for another 1 hr.\nNote: There should be clear supernatant and soft sponge like pellet. We don’t expect see solid pellet.\nCritical: Centrifugation at lower speed (g) will result in little supernatant with huge amount of sponge like pellet.\nCollect the supernatant by pouring out without disturbing the soft pellet.\nNote: We usually obtain 30 mL of the supernatant from 1 L of Sf9 cell culture. Therefore, the volume of the supernatant for 8 L culture is approximately 240 mL.\nNote: Equally distribute the supernatant to six 50 mL conical tubes.\nEquilibrate the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) with the wash buffer A.\nNote: We use 10 mL (packed bead volume) of M2 resin for 8 L of Sf9 cell culture.\nEqually distribute 10 mL of the M2 resin to the supernatants from step #50.\nIncubate the mixture of the supernatant and the M2 resin for 3 h at 4°C in a tube rotator or a tumbler at 10 turns per min.\nCollect the M2 resin by centrifugation at 1,500×g for 5 min.\nAfter slowly pouring out the supernatant from the centrifuged M2 resin, collect all the resin in a single 50 mL tube with the wash buffer A and bring the solution to 50 mL by adding the wash buffer A.\nNote: After centrifugation, the M2 resin sits at the bottom of the 50 mL tubes. Slowly decant the supernatant by pouring out.\nCollect the M2 resin by centrifugation at 1,500×g for 5 min and decant the supernatant by pouring out.",
    "Add 40 mL of the wash buffer A to the M2 resin and resuspend by inverting the tube.\nRepeat step #56–57 for 3 times with the wash buffer A.\nRepeat step #56–57 for 3 times with the wash buffer B.\nRepeat step #56–57 for 3 times with the wash buffer C.\nRepeat step #56–57 for 3 times with the wash buffer B.\nRepeat step #56–57 for 3 times with the wash buffer A.\nAfter washing, load the M2 resin to an Econo-Column® Chromatography Columns, 2.5 × 10 cm (Bio-Rad).\nWash the resin with the wash buffer A until the absorbance of the flow-through becomes lower than 0.01 at the OD280 reading.\nDecant the wash buffer A to the surface of the M2 resin.\nAdd 1 column volume (CV, 10 mL) of the M2 elution buffer slowly on the top of the resin without disturbing the M2 resin and incubate for 10 min.\nCritical: A 10 min incubation with the elution buffer is important for better elution.\nCollect the incubated elution buffer.\nRepeat step #66–67 until the OD280 reading of the eluted sample is less than 0.01.\nNote: We usually collect HTT proteins with 5–6 elutions (total 50–60 mL).\nNote: The expected amount of the proteins at this stage is approximately 15–20 mg from 8 L of the Sf9 cell culture. The amounts of proteins were estimated by OD280 with Abs 0.1% (1 g/L) of 0.78 (the molar extinction coefficient of Q23 HTT is 272,755 cm−1M−1 at 280 nm) and the purity of the samples is higher than 80% based on estimation by SDS-PAGE.",
    "Critical: The A260/A280 ratio should be monitored at this stage. If the ratio is over 1.0, this indicates the contamination of nucleic acids in the sample, which results in significant loss of the proteins during the gel-filtration chromatography step. Refer to the troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nTEV protease treatment\nTiming: 12 h\nRemove the N-terminal tags of HTT with TEV protease.\nCollect the eluted samples and add TEV protease.\nNote: We use home-made TEV protease, which has an N-terminal 6×His-tag. Add 40 μg of TEV protease per 1 mg of the eluted samples (800 μg of TEV protease for 20 mg of HTT protein).\nNote: TEV proteases are commercially available (Thermo Fisher, Cat# 1257023)\nTransfer the sample with TEV protease to Spectra/Por® 1 Dialysis membrane (30 Kd MWCO).\nDialyze the sample for 12–16 h against 2 L of the dialysis buffer.\nNickel affinity chromatography\nTiming: 1 h\nRemove the uncleaved protein and the remaining TEV protease with Ni affinity chromatography.\nLoad the Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) to a Econo column (2.5×10 cm).\nNote: Use 10 mL of Ni-NTA.\nNote: Ensure that Ni-NTA is resistant to 1 mM DTT and 0.5 mM EDTA in the dialysis buffer. We found that Ni-NTA from Qiagen is suitable for this step.\nEquilibrate the Ni-NTA resin with the dialysis buffer.\nLoad the sample from step #71 to pass through the equilibrated Ni-NTA column and collect the flow-through.\nReload the collected flow-through to the Ni-NTA again.\nRepeat step #74–75 for 3 times.\nConcentrate the sample using an Amicon Ultra 100-KDa filter up to 10 mL (less than 2 mg/mL concentration) by repeated centrifugation at 1,500×g for 5 min each time.",
    "Critical: Repeated centrifugation at 1,500×g for 5 min each time is critical as exceeded time or centrifugation at higher speed (g) can induce precipitant. Please pipetting the samples after every centrifuge cycle.\nSize exclusion chromatography\nTiming: 3 h\nNote: Elution profiles of the size exclusion chromatography and protein quality of final concentrated samples are shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1103-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Size exclusion chromatography and PAGE analysis of recombinant HTT\n(A) The elution profile of HTT purification from size exclusion chromatography with 10% SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions. Asterisk indicates the position of the fraction in the gel.\n(B) The purity of purified HTT was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE (lefts) and 5% native-PAGE (right). The proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining.\nEquilibrate a Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 column (Cytiva) with the gel filtration buffer.\nLoad the concentrated sample from step #77 to the equilibrated column and run the column with a 2.0 mL/min flow rate and 5 mL fraction size.\nEvaluate the purity of each fraction by SDS-PAGE.\nCollect the fractions containing HTT proteins and concentrate the sample using an Amicon Ultra 100-KDa filter up to 5 mg/mL concentration.\nCritical: Concentrate over 5 mg/mL can lead to precipitation.\nAliquot the sample into ∼20 μL per tube and snap freeze with liquid nitrogen. Store the samples at −80°C.\nNote: The sample can remain stable at −80°C up to 1 year.\nNote: With this protocol, we obtained 8 mg of recombinant HTT proteins from 8 L of Sf9 cell culture.\nNote: The expected purity of samples at this step is over 95%.",
    "Critical: Ensure that the samples are centrifuged after thawing the proteins to remove precipitant. When the proteins are thawed, the sample should be cleared by centrifugation at 17,000×g for 20 min at 4°C to remove any precipitant formed during storage. Otherwise, all the HTT proteins will start to precipitate."
