    "Protocols for all procedures involving animals must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Follow officially approved procedures for the care and use of laboratory animals. Intra-prostatic injection requires open-abdominal surgery and animals should be kept in a pathogen-free environment with a designated surgery room where proper surgical aseptic techniques are used during the entire procedure.\n1. Preparation of Cells for Implantation\nNOTE: Based on research need, any prostate cancer cell line can be used. Cell lines are cultured according to the supplier's instructions.\nFor the PC3M-Luc-C6 cell line that stably expresses the firefly luciferase gene, culture cells in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1x Non-essential aminoacids, 1x Phleomycin D1 and 1mM sodium Pyruvate. Maintain cells in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PC3M-Luc-C6 cells were procured from UCSF core facility.\nHarvest cells by trypsinization. Wash culture plates once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Add 2 ml 0.05% Trypsin to a 10 cm dish and incubate for 3-5 min in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C till cells are detached.\n\t\nTo avoid clumping, do not agitate the cells by hitting or shaking the dish while waiting for cells to detach. Collect the cells in 5 ml of complete media and spin down for 5 minutes at 200 x g. Wash the cell pellet with PBS to remove trypsin.\nEnumerate live cells by trypan blue exclusion assay. Mix 10 µl of the cell suspension in PBS with 10 µl of 0.4% (wt/v) trypan blue solution. Load the mixture into a hemocytometer or counting chamber slide and count cells immediately under a microscope or read the chamber slide in a cell counter.",
    "Prepare a cell suspension containing 2.5 x 105 cells in 10 µl media. Mix the cell suspension with 10 μl basement membrane-like extracellular matrix extract and place the cells on ice. Add luciferin to the cell suspension (1:200 µl; stock 30 mg/ml concentration) before injecting into mice.\n\t\tNOTE: This allows immediate bio-imaging of animals to check the consistency of cell injections among different experimental groups. Inject cells as quickly as possible, preferably within 30 min after trypsinization since cell viability decreases rapidly after detachment.\n2. Preparation of the Surgical Area\nPerform surgery in an uncluttered, disinfected area that promotes asepsis.\nSanitize the counter/lab bench with bleach solution before surgery.\n\tNOTE: The use of alcohol is discouraged due to long contact time required to take effect (15 min).\nUse sterile drapes, clean absorbable pads or towels, and replace these materials after each surgical session. Sterilize all instruments prior to use. Preferred methods are a steam autoclave, glass bead sterilizer, ethylene oxide gas, or hydrogen peroxide vapor sterilization.\nUse an aseptically cleaned dissecting microscope to perform the surgical procedure or experienced researchers can perform it without a microscope.\n3. Implantation of Tumor Cells\nUse male 6-8 week old immunocompromised Balb/c or NOD/SCID mice.\n\tNOTE: It is more difficult to operate on smaller animals and larger animals tend to have slower kinetics of tumor growth and metastasis.\nInject pre-surgery pain medication according to the animal facility's instructions. For example, intra-peritoneal Buprenorphine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight can be used.\nAnesthetize animals by placing them into an isoflurane chamber with 1-3% isoflurane in oxygen and wait until animals are fully anesthetized. Ensure that there is no toe reflex of muscle tone at this point. Use proper veterinary ophthalmic ointment lubricant to prevent blindness due to xerophthalmia during general anesthesia.",
    "NOTE: Anesthetize the animals by the investigator's preferred method e.g., for Pentobarbital Sodium, 0.05 mg per gram body weight is administered intra-peritoneal or Ketamine/Xylazine solution (concentration: 17.16 mg/ml) at a dose of 65 mg/kg body weight is used subcutaneously. Isoflurane inhalation is a preferred method of anesthetization. The eye ointment should be gently applied without rubbing against the cornea.\nRemove the animal from the isoflurane chamber and place into a nose cone apparatus with continuous flow of 1-2% isoflurane in oxygen to ensure that the animal is under full anesthesia before proceeding.\n\t\nRemove hair from mice by shaving or use a hair removing cream before beginning the procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: It would be preferable to place the mouse on a sterile heating pad during surgery.\nPlace mouse in a supine position. Clean the lower abdomen with 10% w/w povidone-iodine solution followed by 70% ethanol swabs.\nWith a pair of fine forceps, lift an area of skin 2 mm above the preputial gland, about 1-2 cm above the penis sheath, and about 2-3 cm below the bottom of the rib cage.\nMake a midline incision 1cm in length, first through the skin with a scalpel and then through the muscle layer with a scissor (Figure 1).\nLocate the bladder in the body cavity. It is a yellow-light brown spherical organ, located directly under the incision (Figure 1).\nWith a pair of fine forceps grip the bladder and lift upward then downward out of the body cavity towards the penis sheath. This will expose the two seminal vesicles which are a pair of white saclike organs and clearly distinct.",
    "With a cotton swab in each hand, externalize the seminal vesicles, one by one, and pull them out of the body cavity and lay them face down on the outer surface of the abdomen with the bladder in the middle (Figure 2).\nUsing the cotton swabs, gently tilt back the seminal vesicles at the point of insertion near the bladder neck, towards the penis sheath, so that the two dorsal prostate lobes are clearly visible. Use wet cotton swabs to avoid tissue damage (Figure 3).\nAgitate the cell suspension with a micropipette before loading in the syringe.\nWhile placing the seminal vesicles in position with a cotton swab, insert the syringe needle into the dorsal prostatic lobe under the microscope (Figure 4). Slowly inject 20 µl of cell suspension until a bulla formation is identified. A bulging bulla indicates that the injection is correct.\nWhile retracting the needle, press lightly on the injection site with a cotton swab and hold for a few seconds to prevent leakage.\nCarefully lift the seminal vesicles with cotton swabs and insert them back in to the body cavity one by one followed by the bladder. Avoid 'twirling' the internal organs while performing this procedure.\nAfter placing the organs back into the body cavity, suture the muscle layer first in an interrupted pattern with absorbable 4-0 chromic catgut sutures followed by the skin closure with non-absorbable 4-0 nylon surgical suture. The skin can also be pulled together and closed with surgical clamps to close the incision completely.\n\tNOTE: Mice have a habit of scratching and biting at their wound, which may lead to re-opening of the wound, hence use of tissue glue is also recommended along with sutures. Image animals immediately to assure that there is equal bioluminescent intensity among all experimental groups.",
    "Return the animals to clean cages and keep them under a warming lamp or heating pad. Monitor the animals constantly until they completely recover from anesthesia and maintain sternal recumbency.\n4. Monitoring of Animals\nMonitor the animals regularly until the end of the experiment, according to institutional protocols. If using surgical metal clips, remove after one to two weeks. Duration of the experiment depends on the specific research need.\n\tNOTE: This experiment was conducted for 21 days to examine the successful establishment of the implanted cancer cells in the mouse prostate.\nAdminister pain medication based on the animal facility's instructions. For example, intra-peritoneal Buprenorphine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight can be used at the time of the procedure with a second dose after 6 hr and additional doses every 8-12 hr as needed.\nMonitor animal weight, food consumption, skin color and texture, activity and frequency of urination and defecation. Euthanize animals immediately if there is a significant loss of body weight greater than 15%.\n\t\nFor euthanasia, deliver CO2 from a pressurized tank into an un-crowded cage at a flow rate to displace 10-30% of the chamber or cage volume/minute, allowing CO2 to enter the chamber slowly so that unconsciousness and complete narcotization occur prior to death.\nMaintain CO2 flow for at least one minute after respiratory arrest and leave animals in the chamber for a sufficient time so that death occurs prior to performing a physical method.\nPerform decapitation, cervical dislocation or any other IACUC approved physical method after euthanizing the animals chemically.",
    "NOTE: Significantly reduced body weight often indicates a lethargic condition. Tumor bearing animals should be in good health except for the presence of tumors until the end of the experiment. Euthanasia should be consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia and must be listed in the approved IACUC protocol.\n5. Non-invasive Bio-imaging of Animals\nMonitor the animals weekly using a non-invasive imaging technique to track colonization of cancer cells, tumor growth and any distant metastasis.\n\tNOTE: Imaging modalities such as GFP-imaging, Luciferase imaging, X-rays or 3D micro-computed tomography (uCT) etc. can be used based upon the specific research need12-15.\nSubscription Required.
