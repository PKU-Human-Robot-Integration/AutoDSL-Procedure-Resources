    "The standard fructose reduction reaction mixture contains 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 1 mM fructose, 0.2 mM NADH and 1 to 10 µg of purified recombinant enzyme, in a final volume of volume 100 µl. The standard mannitol oxidation reaction mixture contains 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mM mannitol, 0.5 mM NAD+ and 1 to 10 µg of purified enzyme in 100 µl. Blank corresponds to reaction mixture where substrate is substituted by MilliQ water (Table 1).Table 1.

    "The continuous assay reaction is started by adding the substrate and the activity is monitored by following changes in absorbance at 340 nm, which corresponds to the decrease or production of NADH, in a Safire2 UV spectrophotometer microplate reader. The reaction is performed at 25 °C for up to 20 min. Only the early linear part of the curves is used to calculate activity (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151030/20151030215952_8515.jpgFigure 2. Early linear parts of curves representative absorbance (340 nm) monitored as a function of time (sec) in presence of mannitol. The curves represent two series of triplicates at 0 and 0.5 mM of mannitol, respectively.Fructose reduction and mannitol oxidation activities, based on decrease or production of NADH respectively, are calculated using the formula:[(ΔA340nm test-ΔA340nm blank)/(t*6220*0.3*0.0001)] WhereΔA340nm= variation of absorbance during the duration of incubation t= duration of incubation (min)6220= extinction coefficient for NADH (L mol-1 cm-1)0.3= optical path (cm)0.0001= assay volume (L)One unit (U) of both activities (fructose reduction or mannitol oxidation) corresponds to 1 µmol of NADH reduced or oxidized per min.To calculate specific activities, divide the value obtained in the equation above by the quantity of ZgM2DH proteins added in the reaction mixture. Perform three replicates for each assay, and determine the average ± S. E. (cf. Notes) for these three replicates. This applies also to the experiments described below. As an example, typical value for specific activity of ZgM2DH was 3.95 U/mg in presence of 10 mM fructose.To determine substrate specificity, test ZgM2DH activity in presence of each substrate listed in the “Materials and Reagents” section, using concentration ranging from 1 mM to at least 100 mM.To determine the optimal pH, replace the 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5 or 6.5) buffer used in step 1 of procedure by other buffers prepared at different pHs.",
    "As an indication, it is possible to use:100 mM MES for pH 5.5, 6, 6.5 100 mM Bis-Tris propane for pH 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5100 mM Tris-HCl for pH 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9To determine the optimal temperature, incubate the reaction mixtures used in step 1 at temperatures ranging, for instance, from 10 °C to 50 °C, with incremental of 5 or 10 °C.To assess the effects of various metal ions and chemicals on ZgM2DH activities, add metal ions or chemicals individually and at varying concentrations in the reaction mixture described in step 1. Examples are given in Table 2. Table 2. Metal ions and chemicals tested for potential influence on the ZgM2DH activities. Mannitol, fructose, mannitol-1-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate were used at high concentrations to assess potential inhibitory effects on enzymatic activity. table:",
