See Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for steps followed to detach cells from the tissue culture plates.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_587_4.csv\nOnce the cells are trypsinized and resuspended in fresh media, count cells with an automated cell counter.\nCarefully seed 10 million cells resuspended in 3.5 mL of culture media on top of collagen-I coated filter, and allow them to adhere to the filter for about 16 h in the incubator (See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Do not add media to the bottom chamber.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/587-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cell attachment to Transwell filters\nCells seed on top of Transwell filters are allowed to attach to the filter for about 16 h.\nCritical: 3.5 mL is enough to cover a 75 mm microporous filter. Make sure the media is distributed homogeneously across the filter to warrant a homogenous cell monolayer. Adding more media to the top of filter may cause media leakage from chamber top to bottom troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: If required, perform an additional step to concentrate the cells by centrifugation.\nNote: We allow cell attachment to filter for about 16 h. Depending on the cell type, shorter attachment times could be used.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Careful seeding of cells on Transwell filter top, related to step\n3\nProtrusion induction and purification - day 2\nTiming: 3–4 h\nProtrusions are induced in a synchronized manner by adding media to the bottom chamber. Protrusions and cell bodies are then fixed and collected in lysis buffer.\nNote: See Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4] for steps 4–6.",
    "Carefully remove Transwell from the incubator and remove media by aspiration.\nAdd 8 mL of fresh media to the top of filter and 12 mL fresh media to the bottom chamber. This will open the pores to the cells and induce the formation of protrusions.\nNote: Media can be added to the bottom chamber through the three openings on the sides of filter inserts.\nAllow protrusion formation by placing Transwell in the incubator for the desired length of time.\nNote: We perform a physical protrusion formation stimulation. For other methods based on chemotactic stimulation please see (Mili et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nOptional: Different incubation times may be used, which may give a different protrusion proteome profiles as we showed in Dermit et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]. In the experiment shown here, we performed a time course of 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min.\nNote: See Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5] for steps 7 and 8.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Replace fresh media on the top of the filter and add media to the bottom, related to steps 4–6\nRemove media and wash off the remaining media with PBS.\nRemove PBS and add ice-cold methanol (8 mL to the top and 12 mL to the) to the filter. Place Transwells with methanol for at least 20 min at −20°C.\nNote: Whilst methanol fixation is not necessary if just one filter is being processed, fixation allows processing of multiple Transwells together at the same time. After fixing, the filter can stay in methanol at −20°C for as long as necessary, allowing one-by-one collection of protrusion and cell-bodies.\nNote: See Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc6] for steps 9–11.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S3. Remove media, wash with PBS, and add cold methanol, related to steps 7 and 8",
    "Place the dish on ice, remove the methanol and gently re-hydrate by adding ice-cold PBS. Aspirate the PBS thoroughly.\nNote: The membrane shape will change due to the dehydration/rehydration.\nPlace 100 μL of lysis buffer inside the lid of a 50 mL falcon tube. Dip a glass coverslip in the lysis buffer and gently shave protrusions off the bottom surface of the filter using the dipped cover slip. Repeat until the whole surface area is shaved.\nOnce protrusions are collected, collect the cell-body fraction by directly adding 500 μL of lysis buffer to the top of the filter. Pipette the lysis buffer over the whole surface area multiple times to lyse as much cell-body as possible.\nNote: Protrusion and cell body fractions are collected in protein LoBind® tubes to prevent protein loss.\nNote: Incompletely solubilized or too viscous lysates can be sonicated. We routinely sonicate MDA-MB231 lysates on Bioruptor Pico sonication device and perform 10 cycles of 30 sec ON and 30 sec OFF. Cell bodies tend to be more viscous due to presence of DNA.\nPause Point: The lysates can be stored at −20°C for several weeks, or at −80°C for several months. A pilot test with Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie blue staining could be run to estimate protein integrity.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4. Remove methanol, wash with PBS, and collect protrusions, related to steps 9–11\nSample preparation for proteomics - day 3\nTiming: 5–6 h\nProtein amounts are estimated and samples are prepared for protein digestion.\nNote: All steps are performed at 20°C–23°C unless indicated otherwise.\nEstimate protein amounts by BCA assay according to manufacturer's instructions. Use multiple replicate reactions per sample and standards to improve the accuracy of measurements.",
    "Transfer 25 μg of each sample to a fresh tube.\nAdd Bond-Breaker TCEP Solution reducing agent to a final concentration of 50 mM (1/10 dilution), and incubate at 95°C for 10 min. Spin down for 30 sec at 16,000 g to collect any condensation.\nAllow the samples to cool down to RT. Add 7x volumes of UA buffer to each reduced sample, and mix gently by inverting the tube multiple times. For example, if sample volume is 50 μL (for 25 μg of sample); add 389 μL of UA buffer [ (50 μL of sample + 5.5 μL of TCEP Solution) ∗7].\nTransfer to Vivacon 500 Hydrosart filters with a molecular cut-off of 30 kDa, for buffer exchange (McDowell et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Concentrate samples by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 20 min. Discard the flow-through.\nNote: A 30 kDa cut-off filter efficiently removes SDS micelles that have an average size of ∼20 kDa. On the other hand, since denatured proteins assume a much larger volume than their folded state, a 30 kDa cut-off filter can still effectively retain most denatured proteins that are >10 kDa in size (Wisniewski, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nCritical: Seldom times Vivacon 500 Hydrosart filters happen to have a faulty seal. To avoid losing material, perform a 1 min quick centrifugation and check how much solution has gone through to the collection tube. Normally, this should be only a small fraction after a short spin, but all material will go through if the seal is faulty. In such case, transfer the sample to a new Vivacon 500 Hydrosart filter.\nNote: Maximum capacity of Vivacon 500 Hydrosart filters is 500 μL. If volume surpasses the capacity repeat the loading step and centrifugation until all volume has been loaded onto the filter.",
    "Note: Sometimes it can take longer for the solution to pass through the filter, especially if too viscous. If the solution has not completely gone through the filter in 20 min, centrifuge for longer until almost all of the solution has gone through. A small amount (∼5–10 μL) remaining on the filter is fine.\nWash the filters twice with UA buffer through cycles of 400 μL buffer addition and concentration at 14,000 g for 20 min. Discard the flow-through.\nAlkylate samples by adding 10 mM iodoacetamide in UA buffer to the filters and incubating at RT for 30 min in the dark.\nNote: Iodoacetamide is light sensitive. Make fresh and keep the solution protected from light at all times.\nConcentrate by centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 min.\nAdd 200 μL of UA buffer to the filters and concentrate again by centrifuging at 14,000 g for 20 min. Discard the combined flow-through. Repeat twice.\nAdd 100 μL of 100 mM Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) to each filter and concentrate by centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 min. Repeat twice. Discard the combined flow-through.\nNote: TMT reagents are amine-reactive; non-amine-based buffer such as TEAB or HEPES are therefore required for efficient labelling (see step 25).\nTransfer the filters to new collection tubes. Add 100 μL of 100 mM TEAB buffer to each filter.\nImmediately before use, thaw a sequencing-grade trypsin vial and add 0.5 μg trypsin to each filter. Incubate filter for about 16 h at 37°C in the thermomixer with shaking (600 rpm).\nNote: To stop filters from drying out, double seal the lid and spin columns with parafilm.\nNote: A trypsin/ substrate ratio between 1:100 to 1:20 (w/w) is recommended.\nNote: Trypsin digestion efficiency for each experiment can be checked a posteriory. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Isobaric peptide labeling - day 4\nTiming: 2.5 h\nTryptic peptides are labeled with TMT isobaric mass tags\nBring TMT10plexTM isobaric label reagent kit stored at −20°C to 20°C–23°C.\nNote: TMT10plexTM kit contains 0.8 mg per labelling channel. 0.2 mg of each channel is sufficient to label 25 μg of protein. Each label vial can be used for 4 independent experiments.\nAdd 164 μL of acetonitrile to each label vial for reconstitution, and incubate for 5 min with occasional vortexing to dissolve.\nBriefly centrifuge the label vials to collect the solutions. Label each filter for about 16 h digested sample with a specific TMT label by adding 41 μL of a given label solution to a Vivacon filter.\nNote: Make sure to record which TMT label you add to which sample. In this experiment we labeled protrusions after 30 min induction with TMT10-127N tag and corresponding cell bodies with TMT10-126 tag; protrusions after 60 min induction with TMT10-128N tag and corresponding cell bodies with TMT10-127C tag; protrusions after 120 min induction with TMT10-129N tag and corresponding cell bodies with TMT10-128C tag; protrusions after 240 min induction with TMT10-130N tag and corresponding cell bodies with TMT10-129C tag; protrusions after 480 min induction with TMT10-130C tag and corresponding cell bodies with TMT10-131N tag. Incubate the reaction for 1 h at 25°C in thermomixer with shaking (600 rpm) to label the peptides.\nNote: TMT label efficiency can be checked a posteriory. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAdd 50 μL of the Quenching Reagent (50% hydroxylamine) to 450 μL of 100 mM TEAB and mix by vortexing. Then quench the TMT-labeling reaction by adding 8 μL of this diluted quenching solution to each Vivacon filter.\nIncubate for 30 min at 25°C in the thermomixer with shaking (600 rpm).",
    "Elute the TMT-labeled peptides by centrifuging the filters at 14,000 g for 10 min.\nWithout removing the eluate from the collection tubes, perform an additional elution by adding 40 μL of 100 mM TEAB and centrifuging the filters at 14,000 g for 10 min. Repeat once. Keep the combined eluate in the collection tubes.\nWithout removing the eluate from the collection tubes, perform a final elution by adding 40 μL of 30% Acetonitrile and centrifuging the filters at 14,000 g for 10 min.\nCombine the differentially TMT-labeled eluates from individual filters in one tube and lyophilize in a speedvac.\nNote: We operate our speedvac at ambient temperature. The running time for drying combined TMT 10plex samples is >5 h. Samples can be left drying in speedvac for about 16 h.\nHigh pH fractionation - day 5\nTiming: 1.5 h\nTo increase the proteomic detection depth, TMT-labeled peptide mixes are fractionated using High pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation spin columns.\nResuspend 100 μg of TMT-labeled peptides in 300 μL of 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Load the peptides into a pre-conditioned spin column from the High pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit by centrifugation (3000 g, 2 min). See manufacturer’s instructions for column conditioning.\nWash the column once with LC-MS grade H2O by centrifugation (3000 g, 2 min).\nPrepare a step gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentrations (5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%, 17.5%, 20%, and 25%) in 0.1% triethylamine, included in the fractionation kit. Progressively apply each of these mixtures to the column and elute by centrifugation (3000 g, 2 min). Collect eluates and keep separately (i.e., 7 different fractions).\nLyophilize each fraction eluate in a speedvac.\nNote: Samples may be left drying in the speedvac for about 16 h.\nPause Point: The lyophilized samples can be stored at −20°C or −80 for several weeks.",
    "Mass spectrometry injection, analysis, and data collection - day 6\nTiming: 2 days\nDried peptides are reconstituted and injected in the mass spectrometer.\nReconstitute samples in 0.1% formic acid (FA).\nNote: Reconstitution volume may depend on the amount and number of samples, as well as the mass spectrometry instrument used. For example, for 100 μg of mixed peptides, we would expect to have ∼14 μg (100/7) in each fraction on average. Therefore, we would reconstitute in 10 μL of FA and inject 1 μL ( ∼1.4 μg) into the nanoflow HPLC for analysis on the Q-Exactive™ Plus mass spectrometer.\nCentrifuge the samples at 4°C at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to remove any insoluble debris, and transfer the supernatant to a 0.2 low binding tube inside an autosampler vial. Place the vial in the LC autosampler and inject the required amount for LC-MS analysis.\nParameters used for LC-MS/MS system are listed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_587_5.csv\nMultiple injections can often be performed as technical replicates. We ran two technical replicates that generated 14 raw files [data deposited in PXD015808 and shown in Dermit et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]]."
