    "All animal experiments described in the protocol were approved by the University of Miami Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). FVB mice, both male and female, aged 8-12 weeks, were used for the study.\n1. Preparation of L-NAME solution\nUnder sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood, prepare an L-NAME stock solution by dissolving 1g of L-NAME powder (see Table of Materials) with 20 mL of sterile water to make a 50 mg/mL of solution. Store the stock solution in 300-500 µL aliquots at -20 °C for up to 3 months.\nTo make a working L-NAME solution, thaw an aliquot of L-NAME stock solution and dilute with PBS (1:4) under sterile conditions to obtain a final 10 mg/mL concentration.\nTo prepare PBS (pH 7.4), dissolve 8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.44 g of Na2HPO4, and 0.23 g of NaH2PO4 in 800 mL of distilled water. Adjust pH to 7.4 with HCl. Add water to a total volume of 1,000 mL and filter through a 0.22 µm bottle top filter.\n\t​NOTE: Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 4 µL/g of L-NAME working solution is equivalent to the desired 40 mg/kg dose of L-NAME. L-NAME working solution should be kept on ice during use, and new dilutions should be made daily using freshly thawed aliquots of stock solution.\n2. Chemical and surgical induction of hindlimb gangrene\nObtain FVB mice, aged 8-12 weeks, either from a breeder or bred in-facility (see Table of Materials). 2 h before surgery, administer a 40 mg/kg IP dose of L-NAME.\nAnesthetize mice with IP injection of 100 mg/kg of ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine (see Table of Materials) diluted in PBS. Confirm adequate sedation by the absence of toe-pinch reflex and continue monitoring respiratory rate during the procedure.",
    "Remove hair from bilateral hindlimbs and groins using shears and/or a depilatory cream. Position the animal under a surgical microscope supine; extend and tape the extremities in place. Sterilize the surgical field by circumferentially applying the povidone-iodine solution to the surgical site.\nUnder 10-20x magnification, use scissors or a scalpel to make a 1 cm incision along the groin crease just inferior to the inguinal ligament. Use fine forceps and a sterile cotton tip applicator to bluntly dissect the inguinal fat pad laterally from the inguinal ligament and expose the underlying femoral sheath so that the femoral artery, vein, and nerve are clearly identified (Figure 1).\nUsing fine forceps, pierce the femoral sheath. Carefully brush the femoral nerve away from the femoral artery. Identify the take-off of the lateral circumflex branch of the femoral artery (LCFA) deep to the femoral nerve (Figure 1).\n\t\nProceed with electrocoagulation of the femoral artery and vein just proximal to the LCFA by activating the cautery device (see Table of Materials) and gently contacting the vessels with a side-to-side motion, ensuring that the femoral nerve is well-isolated and remains protected from thermal injury. Divide the coagulated vessel segment with scissors.\nProceed with the exposure of the distal femoral artery and vein by mobilizing the inguinal fat pad medially. Identify the superficial epigastric artery and saphenopopliteal junction more distally.\n\t\nPierce the femoral sheath between these two locations and carefully dissect the femoral nerve away from the femoral vessels. Proceed with coagulation and transection of the femoral artery and vein as described in step 2.4.1.\nIrrigate the surgical field using a syringe filled with sterile PBS. Obtain hemostasis by applying gentle pressure with a cotton tip applicator for 3-5 min to any areas of bleeding.",
    "Proceed with the closure of the incision using absorbable 5-0 suture in a simple continuous fashion. Administer a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of sustained-release buprenorphine (see Table of Materials) for postoperative pain relief.\nConfirm loss of footpad perfusion in the ligated hindlimb by LDPI (see Table of Materials). While still anesthetized, place the animal on a dark foam pad in a prone position underneath the LDPI machine and use loops of electrical tape to secure the feet in place.\n\t\nProceed with LDPI of bilateral feet. Once the scanning is complete, draw a ROI around each footpad and obtain the mean flux values.\nCalculate the perfusion index as the ratio of mean flux values from the ligated to non-ligated footpad. Ensure that the perfusion index is less than 0.1.\nTransfer the animal back to a clean cage with a heating pad or overhead lamp to maintain core body temperature. Ensure complete recovery from anesthesia before transferring mice back to the animal facility.\n3. Postoperative administration of L-NAME and monitoring of hindlimb gangrene\nOn postoperative days 1-3, administer an additional 40 mg/kg IP dose of L-NAME to each animal. At the same time, carefully evaluate the foot from the ischemic limb.\nQuantify the degree of hindlimb ischemia and gangrene using the Faber hindlimb ischemia score9. Scores 1-5: number of ischemic nails; scores 6-10: 1-5 ischemic digits; scores 11 and 12: partial and complete foot atrophy. Record Faber scores on postoperative days 1-3 and then weekly.\n4. Preparation of DiI and working solutions for animal perfusion\nTo prepare DiI stock solution, dissolve 100 mg of DiI crystals (see Table of Materials) in 16.7 mL of 100% ethanol. Cover in aluminum foil and leave on a rocking platform overnight in the dark at room temperature.",
    "To prepare the diluent, dissolve 50 g of glucose in 1,000 mL of distilled water to yield a 5% glucose solution. Filter through a 0.22 µm bottle top filter. Mix PBS and 5% glucose solutions in a 1:4 ratio to prepare a working diluent solution.\n5. Equipment setup and DiI perfusion\nMake DiI working solution by adding 200 µL of DiI stock solution to 10 mL of the working diluent solution (prepared in step 4.2) immediately before use. Shake by hand to mix well.\nConnect two or three 3-way stopcocks and a 25 G butterfly needle in series. Prepare 10 mL syringes with 4 mL of PBS, 10 mL of DiI solution, and 10 mL of 10% neutral buffered formalin (see Table of Materials).\nConnect the syringe with formalin to the proximal inflow port and inject the solution to flush air from the line; turn the stopcock to close the port. Repeat the same procedure sequentially, connecting the syringes with DiI and then PBS to the middle and distal inflow ports, respectively, taking care to flush all air bubbles through the stopcock assembly.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that there are no air bubbles in any portion of the stopcock assembly or tubing. Air bubbles can occlude small arteries during perfusion resulting in poor intravascular DiI distribution and compromised imaging results.\nOnce the setup is complete, euthanize the animal by CO2 overdose in an induction chamber.\nPlace the animal to be perfused in a supine position on an absorbent pad and secure axillae and lower extremities with needles.\nUsing scissors, make a transverse incision to open the abdominal cavity. Expose and then divide the left and right diaphragm to access the thoracic cavity.",
    "Cut the chest wall on either side of the sternum from the lower ribs to the first or second ribs, avoiding the internal thoracic (mammary) arteries medially. Use a hemostat (see Table of Materials) to grasp the lower end of the sternum and reflect it towards the animal's head to expose the thoracic cavity.\nIdentify the left ventricle, which appears lighter in color than the right ventricle. Gently grasp the heart with blunt forceps and insert the butterfly needle into the left ventricle.\n\t\nUse scissors or an 18 G needle to puncture the right atrium, allowing blood and perfusion solutions to return to the heart to drain. Stabilize the needle with one or two hands, taking care not to inadvertently puncture the right ventricle and perfuse the pulmonary rather than systemic circulation.\nOpen the port to the syringe with PBS and manually inject 2-4 mL at a rate of 1-2 mL/min for 1-2 min to flush blood from the vascular system. Ensure successful perfusion by observing bleeding from the right atrium. After injection, close the port of the PBS syringe.\nOpen the port to the syringe with DiI and inject 5-10 mL at a rate of 1-2 mL/min for 5 min. Monitor the ears, nose, and palms which should turn slightly pink with the injection of DiI solution. After injection, close the port of the DiI syringe and wait for 2 min to allow incorporation of the dye before injection of fixative.\nOpen the port to the syringe with formalin and inject 5-10 mL at a rate of 1-2 mL/min for 5 min. After injection, remove the needle from the left ventricle and proceed to harvest the tissues of interest.",
    "Using heavy scissors, dislocate the tibia at the ankle, completely separating the left and right feet from the lower legs. Place harvested feet in a 6- or 12-well plate with 1-2 mL of 10% formalin solution. Wrap the plate with foil and store at 4 °C overnight.\n6. Preparation of footpad tissue for confocal laser scanning microscopy\nThe next day, replace the fixative solution in 6- or 12-well plate with 1-2 mL of PBS per well.\nTo skin the foot, first, make a longitudinal incision with a scalpel on the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Then, using toothed forceps and a small hemostat, carefully remove all skin from the foot and digits, not damaging the underlying soft tissues.\nProceed to mounting and imaging of tissues, preferably within 1-2 days of perfusion and harvest. Alternatively, return footpads to 6- or 12-well plates with 1-2 mL of PBS; cover with foil and store at 4 °C to maintain fluorescence for up to 1 month.\nTo mount tissues, individually place feet between two glass microscope slides with a foam biopsy pad folded over itself (once or twice depending on tissue thickness) at each end (see Table of Materials). Use two small binder clips to compress the glass slides together at each end (final thickness approximately 1 mm).\n\t​NOTE: Thicker tissues will require longer scanning times. The skinned footpad can be compressed between glass slides one day before imaging to reduce tissue thickness.\n7. Confocal laser scanning microscopy\nPrepare for the imaging session: turn on the imaging system and start the acquisition software (see Table of Materials). Use a low magnification/low numeric aperture objective (e.g., x5/0.15) to capture images as lower magnification lenses typically have longer working distances required for this experiment.",
    "Click on Yes to the Activate Stage dialog box. Activate the 561 nm laser in the Configuration tab. On the main screen, activate a visible beam path by clicking on the Visible button. Set a detector to the 570-600 nm range by clicking on the corresponding Active checkbox.\nSelect the Tile Scan icon in the Acquire > Acquisition tab and set the desired resolution (512 x 512 or 1024 x 1024).\nPosition dry-mounted (no water or PBS added) tissue sample compressed between glass slides on the microscope stage and bring tissue into focus.\nTo set the scanning boundaries, navigate to the upper left or right corner of the sample. In the Acquisition tab, under the Tile Scan menu, click on the Mark Position button. Navigate to the opposite corner (lower right or left, respectively) and click on the Mark Position button once again.\nTo set the depth of the Z-stack, click on the Live button at the lower-left corner of the screen and navigate to the center of the sample. Use the z-axis knob to scroll through to the bottom of the sample.\nIn the Acquisition tab, under the Z-Stack menu, click on the Begin button. Scroll through to the top of the sample and click on the End button. Click on Z-step Size and set to the desired value (e.g., 50 µm).\nIn the lower right corner of the screen, click on Start to begin image acquisition.\n8. Quantitative analysis and 3D reconstruction of footpad vascularity\nDownload and install the latest version of Fiji (ImageJ) as well as the Vessel Analysis plugin20. Open microscopy image files in Fiji, which will combine individual Z-series into Z-stacks that can be viewed in the z-axis using the slider at the bottom of the image.",
    "Select the composite Z-stack image and then under the menu Image, choose Stacks > Z Project to create a two-dimensional projection. Next, convert the Z-projection to binary under Process > Binary > Make Binary.\nRun the Vascular Density plugin under Plugins > Vascular Density. When prompted, use the cursor to trace a ROI around the perimeter of the footpad and digits. Take note of the vessel density that is reported, which is expressed as a percentage of the ROI (vascular area fraction).\nTo create 3D reconstructions in Fiji, select Stacks > 3D Project and set the desired rotation axis, angle, and speed under the menu Image. Alternatively, select Volume Viewer under the Plugins menu to visualize images as slices or manipulate the reconstruction in the desired axes.\nFor more involved 3D rendering, use alternative image analysis and processing software (see Table of Materials). Convert files to the desired software's format and stitch individual tile scans using the tile stitching functionality.\nAfter stitching individual tile scans together, open the composite file and proceed with volume surface rendering. Click on Add New Surface to open the Surface Creation Wizard and use the arrows to toggle through menus, notably setting the ROI and threshold intensity. Once satisfied with the surface rendering, utilize the animation functionality to create videos of the processed image.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
