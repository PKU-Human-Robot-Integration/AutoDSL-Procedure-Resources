  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures outlined here have been approved by Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Care and Use Committee.\n1. Synthesis of modRNA\nNOTE: The details of modRNA synthesis can be found in Kondrat et al.13.\nOrder the plasmid templates (Table of Materials) and generate a clean PCR product to use as the mRNA template.\nPrepare the modRNAs by transcription in vitro with a customized ribonucleoside blend of the following (Table of Materials): T7 transcription kit, 6 mM anti-reverse cap analog (ARCA) 30-O-Me-m7G(50) ppp(50)G, 75 mM guanosine triphosphate, 75 mM adenosine triphosphate, 75 mM cytidine triphosphate, 100 mM pseudouridine-5-triphosphate, and T7 DNase enzyme.\nPurify the modRNA made in step 1.2 with a transcription cleanup kit (Table of Materials) and treat with antarctic phosphatase. Next, repurify the modRNA with the transcription cleanup kit and quantify it using a spectrophotometer.\nPrecipitate the modRNA with ethanol and ammonium acetate and resuspend in 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA.\nConcentrate the modRNA for in vivo delivery by centrifugal filters and measure the quality using an automated electrophoresis platform (Table of Materials).\n2. Preparation of modRNA injection for in vivo delivery\nCalculate the volume needed for 100 µg of luciferase (Luc)/Cre modRNA injection based on the modRNA concentration.\nMix the calculated volume of modRNA with equal parts of sucrose solution prepared in nuclease free water (0.3 g/mL) and 0.1 M citrate solution (pH = 7) (20 µL each recommended).\nBring the final volume of the injection to 60 µL by adding saline solution.\n3. Myocardial infarction surgery\nAnesthesia and preparation of the animal\n\tNOTE: This study uses male and female CFW mice 8−12 weeks old.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with 2% isoflurane using an induction chamber and place the animal on its back in a dorsal position with a facemask over its nose and mouth to keep up the anesthesia. Maintain the anesthesia by mechanical ventilation using a respirator equipped with a 7−8 mm airway tube and a filter.\nTo immobilize the mouse on the surgery platform, secure its limbs with surgical tape. shave the neck area and the left side of the ribcage and disinfect using 70% ethanol and povidone iodine. Repeat the disinfecting step twice. Check its reflexes, pinching the tail and hind feet to assess the depth of anesthesia.\nContinuously monitor and maintain the core body temperature at normothermia (37.5−38 °C).\nMaintain an open airway by performing intratracheal intubation. To do this, place the mouse in a ventral position with its mouth facing towards the experimenter and gently pull out the tongue. Adjust the angle of the neck and straighten the intubation path and push in the intubation cannula.\nIn case the animal is unable to breathe through it, tracheostomy can be performed. Perform a cervical incision along the midline isolating the skin, muscle, and tissue outlining the trachea using a microscope. When the trachea is clearly visible, insert the endotracheal tube into the tissue between two cartridge rings below the glottis by making a small hole and holding the cranial part of the trachea using microsurgical forceps.\nObserve the thoracic movement of the mouse to verify that both lungs are receiving oxygen. The respiratory rate (RR) should be approximately 120 breaths per minute, with an inspiratory pressure of 17−18 cm H2O.\nLeft anterior descending (LAD) artery ligation",
    "To perform the LAD ligation, turn the mouse carefully so it is lying on its right side. Lift the skin and perform a left sided thoracotomy between the 3rd and the 4th rib and dissect the tissue and muscle carefully. Use a cautery to prevent bleeding.\nOpen the thorax carefully and once it is open, find the heart, without touching the lung with any sharp object. Place the retractors into the incision to keep the thoracic cavity open and have a clear view of the heart. Now move the lungs to the edge of the incision and remove the part of the pericardial sac that is covering the heart to access the anterior surface of the heart.\nCarefully identify the LAD, which can be seen as a deep light red vessel located between the pulmonary artery and the left auricle. Ligate the LAD proximal with one single suture of a 7-0 silk suture. Place a chest tube (28 G, venal catheter), between the 4th and the 5th rib.\nClose the thoracic incision in layers. Use the 6-0 silk running sutures to adapt the ribs and use 5-0 silk running sutures to close the skin. Make sure to leave a proper window for future echocardiographic measurement.\nCarefully drain the thorax with warm isotonic solution (9 g of sodium chloride in 1 L of water) using a 2 mL syringe. Place the mouse on its back. If performing tracheostomy, take the endotracheal tube out and using 7-0 silk sutures adapt the tracheal cartridge rings with one single stitch. Place the face mask on the mouse and close the skin using 5-0 silk running sutures.",
    "For the recovery phase, disconnect the intubation cannula from the ventilator and allow spontaneous breathing. Place the animal under a heat lamp until it attains consciousness. Do not leave the animal unattended after surgery until it is fully awake.\nManage pain therapy with buprenophine at 0.1 mg/kg body weight, injected subcutaneously for the next 3 days at 12 h intervals.\n4. Cardiac delivery of modRNA\nDeliver a total of 60 µL of the modRNA prepared in step 2.3 intramuscularly (IM) using an insulin syringe (31 G) following an MI.\n\t\nInject 20 µL of the modRNA at three different sites of the heart muscle surrounding the infarct area (two on either side of ligation and one in the apex). Perform the injections immediately after the LAD, before closing the chest.\n\t\tNOTE: Representative images of modRNA injection sites can be seen in the Figure 1.\n5. Protein expression validation in heart post MI\nLuciferase modRNA expression using a bioluminescence imaging system\n\tNOTE: A total of 100 µg of Luc mRNA prepared in 60 µL of the sucrose citrate buffer is directly injected into the heart of CFW mice after the MI.\n\t\nAt 24 h post MI and modRNA injection, anesthetize the mice with 2% isoflurane using an induction chamber and intraperitoneally inject luciferin (150 mg/g body weight) to validate the Luc signal in vivo.\nImage the mice using a bioluminescence imaging system every 2 min until the Luc signal reaches saturation.\nQuantify the collected imaging data with imaging analysis software. Use the mice injected with saline only as a baseline reading for Luc expression and subtract the background signal collected from the saline-injected mice.\n\t\tNOTE: Luc signal is expressed in p/s/cm2/sr x 106.\nImmunostaining for Cre transfection validation",
    "To validate the transfection with Cre, sacrifice the animals 24 h postinjection using an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine followed by cervical dislocation. Before making an incision, disinfect the chest and abdomen using a 70% alcohol swab.\nOpen the thoracic cavity by making a transverse incision ~1 cm lower than the sternum and move the scissors towards the head, cutting through the rib cage.\nOpen the chest and inject 1 mL of sterile PBS in the right ventricular chamber to remove excess blood. Excise the heart immediately and place it in the sterile PBS to wash away the remaining blood.\nFix the heart in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h, followed by overnight incubation in 30% sucrose solution at 4 °C. The following day embed the hearts in optimal cutting temperature medium and section them at a thickness of 10 µm using a cryostat.\nStain the sections with primary antibody against cardiac troponin I (cTNI) and label them with a fluorescent secondary antibody. To identify the nucleus, stain with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min. Image the slides using a fluorescent microscope.\n6. Statistical analysis\nPlot a bar graph based on the Luc expression in saline and Luc-injected mice and report the values as mean ± SEM. Compare the two groups using an unpaired t-test (****p < 0.0001).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
