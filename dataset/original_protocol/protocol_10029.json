    "1. Conversion of a commercial 3D printer into a 3D bioprinter\nRemove the extruder and the heater of a commercial 3D printer (Table of Materials) from the printer frame, and unplug the wiring controlling these elements from the main circuit board (Figure 1A). Since the sensor that controls the operational temperature of the printer needs to be functional to communicate with the printer software, remove from the printing software the algorithm that delays printing until operational temperature is reached.\nConnect a pipette tip (200 µL tip) via silicon tubing (inner diameter of 1 mm) to a 5 mL syringe loaded into a syringe pump. Mount the pipette tip onto the 3D printer extruder head as a replacement for the original extruder (Figure 1B).\nIf more than one type of bio-ink will be used, mount additional tubing system(s) and pipette tip(s) to the printer.\n2. Substrate preparation for 3D printing\nAdd 4 mL of 5 M CaCl2 solution to 400 mL of 1% w/v agar dissolved in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) medium, supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and inducers (here 34 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 0.5% rhamnose).\nDispense 20 mL of the LB-agar solution into each 150 mm x 15 mm Petri dish. Dry 30 min at room temperature with the lid half-open.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here by storing these printing substrates at 4 °C for up to several days.\n3. Bio-ink preparation\nPrepare a sodium alginate solution (3% w/v), and heat to the boiling point three times to sterilize the solution. Store at 4 °C until used.",
    "Grow E. coli MG1655 PRO ΔcsgA ompR234 (E. coli ΔcsgA) bacteria carrying plasmids pSB1C3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (constitutive GFP expression)2 or pSB1C3-GFP-CsgA (constitutive GFP expression, rhamnose-inducible CsgA expression) overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm in 50 mL of LB medium containing 34 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 0.5% rhamnose.\nCentrifuge the cell culture for 5 min at 3,220 x g to pellet the bacteria. Remove the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the bacteria pellet in 10 mL of LB medium and add 10 mL of sodium alginate (3% w/v).\n4. 3D printing process\nInstall and open the 3D printing software (Table of Materials) on a computer. Connect the 3D printer to the computer. Move the printhead to its home position by clicking the home button for the X, Y, and Z axes.\nFor each print, place a prepared printing substrate onto a particular location on the printing bed.\nCalibrate the height of the printhead in the Z axis.\n\t\nRaise the printhead to a height of 22 mm under manual control, so that it will not collide with the edge of the petri dish when moving to the desired position. Position the printhead overtop of the plate, and move it down until the pipette tip contacts the printing surface. Assign this Z-axis position as Z1 (the height of the printing surface).\nRaise the printhead, and move it outside of the plate area by manual control in the X, Y, and Z axes. If the working distance between the printhead and the plate surface is defined as Z2, enter Z1 + Z2 into the printing program as the Z-value during printing.\nProgram the printing shape by a self-developed point-by-point coordinate-determined method according to the desired trajectory.",
    "If the desired trajectory is a straight line, define only the start and end points. Including additional points on curved lines will result in smoother curves. Move the printhead manually to every point sequentially, and record the coordinates of these points in order. Enter all of these coordinates as well as the printhead moving speed for each printed segment into the G-code editor.\nBoth before and after printing, lift the printhead to a distance higher than the plate edge (20 mm), and move directly out of the plate region. Save this program as a G-code file and load directly for use in subsequent prints, while re-measuring the Z axis height for each new printing substrate.\n\tNOTE: See Table 1 for an example G-code for printing a square.\nLoad the pre-programmed G-code file. Open the G-code editor in the software, and program in the commands for printing the desired shape. At each command line, the position of the printhead may be changed in the X, Y, and/or Z axis. Input the Z value during all printing steps as Z1 + Z2 (height of printing surface + working distance).\n\tNOTE: The moving speed is also adjustable; 9,000 mm/min is a suitable value for typical printing rates.\nLoad the liquid bio-ink into syringe(s), and mount them in the syringe pump(s) of the 3D bioprinter.\nPrint the bio-ink onto the printing substrate by clicking the Print button.\nDuring printing, control the printhead movement entirely by the software. Manually start the syringe pump before the printhead comes into contact with the printing surface.",
    "NOTE: The coordination of the syringe pump and the printer is empirically determined depending on the extrusion speed, the speed at which the printhead moves to the first print point, and the initial position of the printhead. If the initial printhead position is 20 mm, with a printhead speed of 9,000 mm/min and an extrusion speed of 0.1 mL/h, start the syringe pump immediately after the printing is started. If the extrusion speed is changed from 0.1 mL/h to 0.3 mL/h, then wait 2−3 s to start the syringe pump after the printing is started.\nStop the syringe pump as soon as the printhead arrives at the last point of printing. Halt the syringe pump before the printhead lifts up at the end of the printing process, otherwise excess bio-ink will drop onto the printing substrate and reduce the printing resolution.\nFor the construction of 3D structures, control all movements of the printhead in the G-code editor. Type in the printing height of the first layer. Increase the Z-value in the G-code by 0.2 millimeters for the second layer to increase the printing height. Thereafter, increase the Z-value by 0.1 millimeters when moving to a higher layer. Do not move the plate during the printing process.\nTo measure the width and height of the printed hydrogel, use a steel ruler placed underneath or alongside the sample.\n5. Growing and testing the effectiveness of biofilm production by E. coli\nIncubate the printed samples at room temperature for 3−6 days to allow the production of biofilm components (curli fibers). Image the plates using a camera or fluorescent scanner.",
    "To dissolve the alginate matrix, add 20 mL of 0.5 M sodium citrate solution (pH = 7 adjusted with NaOH) to the printing substrates, and incubate for 2 h with 30 rpm shaking at room temperature. Discard the liquid and image the plates again to compare with the images of the plates before citrate treatment.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
