    "1. Preparation of Splints and Occlusive Dressings\nOutline 10 mm circles on 0.5 mm thick silicone sheeting and use scissors or a biopsy punch to create silicone disks.\nCentre a 5 mm biopsy punch in the middle of the 10 mm circle and press firmly to create a hole to form a \"donut\"-like disc that will be used as a splint.\nOutline 10 mm circles on a transparent occlusive dressing such as Opsite and use scissors to create circular dressings.\n2. Experimental Animals\nObtain Animal Ethics Committee approval for all experiments that will be performed.\nUse 8-week old (22-26 grams) male C57BL/6J mice from a commercial breeder (e.g. The Jackson Laboratories).\nKeep mice in standard conditions of 21 °C and a 12 hr light-dark cycle with free access to food and water.\n(Optional): Diabetes can be induced in 6 to 7 week old mice by a bolus intraperitoneal injection of 165 mg/kg streptozotocin (in citrate buffer, pH 4.5), with hyperglycemia confirmed by regular blood glucose monitoring (AccuChek glucometer). Diabetic mice may have polyuria and so their bedding may need to be changed more frequently to eliminate wetness and their weights should be monitored closely.\n3. Anesthesia and Operative Preparation\nInduce general anesthesia using 5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen (flow rate 1 L/min) and maintain anesthesia using 1-3% isoflurane.\nEnsure the deep pedal reflexes of the mouse are suppressed and place the mouse in the prone position.\nPrepare the operative region by removing fur with clippers from the base of the neck to 3 cm further down the back and between the two shoulder blades.\nA light application of depilatory cream may be applied for no longer than 2 min. Wet gauze swabs can be used to ensure all cream and remaining fur is removed.",
    "Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab and two applications of 10% povidone-iodine (Betadine) and drape the mouse.\n4. Excision and Splinting of Wound\nDiagrammatic representation of the murine wound-healing model is presented in Figure 1.\nUse a sterile 4 mm biopsy punch to outline two circular patterns for the wound on either side of the mouse's midline at the level of the shoulders (see Figures 2a-2b).\nUse serrated forceps to lift the skin in the middle of the outline and iris scissors to create a full-thickness wound that extends through the subcutaneous tissue (Figures 2c-2d), including the panniculus carnosus (Figure 2e), and excise the circular piece of tissue.\nRepeat the process for the wound on the other side of the midline (Figure 2f).\nRemove plastic protective coating from each side of the silicone splint.\nApply cyanoacrylate adhesive (e.g. Super Glue or Krazy Glue) to one side of a silicone splint.\nCentre the splint over the wound (Figure 2g) and anchor the splint with interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures to ensure positioning (Figure 2h).\nRepeat the splinting process on the other wound.\nIf required at this time-point, apply the therapeutic compound to be tested (up to 100 μl) to one wound (Figure 2i), and the vehicle control to the other.\nCover the wound with a transparent occlusive dressing (for example, OpSite) (Figure 2j-2k).\nA ruler is placed below the splints and a photomicrograph taken (Figure 2l).\n6. Postoperative Management\nCarprofen (5 mg/kg) is administered once daily via sub-cutaneous injection for post-operative pain relief.\nAfter the surgery animals are individually caged and maintained on heat mats until fully recovered.\nMonitor animals twice daily for manifestations of pain and weight loss. We observed no gross behavioral displays of pain or weight loss.\n7. Wound Measurement and Treatment\nThe wound can be measured daily.",
    "Induce general anesthesia using 5% isoflurane gas (flow rate 1 L/min), and then ensure the deep sensory reflexes of the mouse are suppressed using 1-3% isoflurane.\nGently peel back the occlusive dressing with forceps.\nUse surgical calipers to measure the wound diameter. We take the average of three measurements along the X, Y and Z axis (Figures 2m-2o) as well as a photomicrograph for future reference (Figure 2p).\nOptional: At this time the animal can be assessed for blood perfusion using a laser Doppler imager (Figure 2q).\nRe-application of the therapeutic compound and the vehicle control can be performed at this point.\nA clean transparent occlusive dressing is then re-applied and the animals kept warm until fully recovered.\nNote: if splints are not secured properly the wound will readily contract (Figure 2r).\n8. Histological Analysis\nEuthanize the mice after 10 days with an overdose of anesthesia.\nUsing forceps and a scalpel blade remove the sutures and carefully peel away the splint.\nUse iris scissors to create a wide, full excision around and under the wound area and incubate the tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C overnight.\nTransfer tissue to 17% sucrose in PBS solution for a further 24 hr at 4 °C then remove excess solution by dabbing carefully on tissue and place in O.C.T compound and freeze at -80 °C.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining can be used to visualize the wound structure and epithelial gap. Neovascularisation can be assessed by immunohistochemical analyses to determine the number of capillaries (using Von Willebrand factor).\nSubscription Required.
