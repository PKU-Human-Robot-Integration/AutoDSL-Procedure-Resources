Follow the Novagen protocol (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/SAJ/Brochure/2/TB009.pdf[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/SAJ/Brochure/2/TB009.pdf]) for transformation and plate on LB agar supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/mL). Details describing how to make media and buffers are in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\nNote: The Rosetta-2 (DE3) pLysS chemically competent cells have an inherent chloramphenicol resistance. Therefore, to maintain the rare codons supplied with this E. coli strain, chloramphenicol must be present.\nFrom a single colony, using a sterile pipette tip, inoculate 250 mL of LB preculture supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/mL) in a 1 L flask.\nGrow preculture for 14–18 h at 37°C and 180–200 rpm in a shaker (Forma Scientific- Model 4580 Orbital incubator Shaker).\nIn 6 L Erlenmeyer flask (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing M9 Minimal Media with antibiotics ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/mL), glucose, and vitamin (commercially available Centrum) add preculture (1:100 dilution).\nCritical: If the protein is to be used for NMR experiments, 15NH4Cl should be used in the media instead of 14NH4Cl, to produce uniformly 15N-labeled protein.\nTransfer 6 L flasks to an InnOva 4330 floor shaker (New Brunswick Scientific CO., Inc.) prewarmed to 37°C and shake at 200 rpm. When the optical density (test in a Biowave CO8000 Cell Density Meter, Biochrom) reaches 0.6–0.8 at an absorbance of 600, turn down the temperature and speed to 16°C and 180 rpm, respectively.\nOnce the temperature reaches 16°C–19°C, add isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (GoldBio) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Express protein at 16°C for 18 h.",
    "Note: Zinc ions are essential for the expression of the BRPF1PZP domain. At this point, to increase yield of the protein it helps to add (20–30 μM ZnCl2) along with the IPTG during induction. Additionally, more IPTG added during expression of BRPF1PZP, may cause protein production to increase, however we have observed a delicate equilibrium that exists between well folded protein, and protein that is not. Therefore, we found a final concentration of 0.5 mM (to less than 1mM) IPTG in combination with zinc to be the best for expression of folded protein.\nHarvest the cultures and collect cell pellets by centrifugation in a F10-6 × 500y Fixed-Angle Rotor (Thermo Fisher Sci) in a floor centrifuge (Sorvall) for 10 min at 4,400 × g and 10°C.\nPause Point: Cell pellets can be stored for several months at −80°C.\nNote: If using more than 2 L of expressed cells at a time during cell lysis, it is best to freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen and then thaw them before starting next step. If the cells are to be stored, they can be frozen again in liquid nitrogen before storing in −80°C.\nResuspend cells in a beaker using PZP Purification Buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P 40, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 μM ZnCl2, and 5 mM MgCl2). Best to stir the cells for complete resuspension for 10–30 min at 4°C on a stir plate with a stir bar.\nNote: Lysozyme (Thermo Fisher Sci) and Dnase I (Roche) will promote cell lysis and enhance solubility of the protein. If protein degradation during purification is visible, 1 mM phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Sigma-Aldrich) can be added during cell lysis.\nSonicate the suspended cells in a beaker on ice for 5 min.",
    "Settings for the sonicator (Qsonica): 60% power with intervals of 5 s on and 10 s off.\nMix cells and repeat previous step. Always keep cell suspension on ice.\nSpin down the cell suspension in balanced 50 mL NalgeneTM Oak Ridge High-Speed PPCO Centrifuge tubes (Thermo Fisher Sci) at 27,000 × g using a SS-34 Fixed Angle Rotor (Thermo Fisher Sci) at 4°C–10°C for 30 min.\nGently collect the supernatant, be careful not to disturb the pellet containing the cell debris and insoluble fraction.\nCombine the supernatant with equilibrated glutathione beads in a 50 mL centrifuge tube and place on a rocker (Unico) (at low-medium speed) for 1 h at 4°C.\nWash the beads using PZP Purification Buffer B (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT) following the glutathione bead protocol (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0011719_Pierce_Glutathione_Agarose_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0011719_Pierce_Glutathione_Agarose_UG.pdf]) using either batch or gravity flow column method (Econo-Pac® Chromatography Column Bio-Rad).\nAfter washing out the unbound impurities, take a 15 μL sample of the beads for analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).\nIn the tube containing the beads, bring the volume up to 15–20 mL with PZP Purification Buffer B. To cleave the GST-tag, add TEV enzyme and follow protocol from the manufacture or use home purified enzyme (14 mg/mL, 30 μL) (Liu et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) and gently rock on a platform shaker set to level 2-3, (Microplate Titer Plate Shaker, LAB-LINE INSTRUMENTS, Inc.) for 15–20 h at 4°C.\nNote: Fast or rough agitation at this stage in the purification may not be good for the protein stability.\nVerify cleavage and purification steps by SDS PAGE.\nThe 10–15 well 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels can either be poured (5% stacking, 15% resolving) in a 1.5 mm mini gel cassette (Thermo Fisher Sci) or purchased (gradient 4%–15%).http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/Bulletin_6201.pdf[href=http://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/Bulletin_6201.pdf]",
    "Prepare gel and 4× SDS loading buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 400 mM DTT, 8% (w/v) SDS, 0.4% (w/v) bromophenol blue, and 40% (v/v) glycerol).\nHeat samples at 90°C for 10 min to denature proteins, spin down for 5–10 s at 5,000 × g in an Eppendorf Microcentrifuge 5424R (Eppendorf) and then load on gel.\nRun until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.\nAfter desired cleavage is obtained (visually inspect that 75%–90% of cleavage has occurred), elute the protein contained in the supernatant. Using a 10,000 Da MWCO centrifugal filter (Millipore) concentrate the protein to 2 mL at 3,000 × g in an Eppendorf 5810 R Centrifuge with an A-4-62 rotor (Eppendorf).\nTo further purify the BRPF1PZP protein, inject concentrated protein into a HiPrep™ 16/60 Sephacryl® S-100 HR (Cytiva) equilibrated with Purification Buffer B. Run column at 0.2 mL/minute in 4°C. Protein elutes at approx. 66 mL on this column.\nRun SDS PAGE as in step 16 to verify and select pure fractions. Pool fractions and concentrate to 20–40 mg/mL using a 10,000 Da MWCO centrifugal filter (Millipore) at 3,000 × g in an Eppendorf 5810 R Centrifuge with an A-4-62 rotor (Eppendorf).\nBRPF1PZP proteins can be used immediately or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.\nCritical: Prior to freezing and storage of protein, aliquot protein into multiple tubes (10–50 μL each) to prevent unnecessary repeated freezing and thawing.\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration experiments\nTiming: approx. 1 day for each ligand\nEvaluate the interaction between BRPF1PZP and its ligands by NMR spectroscopy.\nGently thaw purified 15N-labeled BRPF1PZP on ice. Centrifuge at 15,000 × g in an Eppendorf Microcentrifuge 5424R (Eppendorf) and separate supernatant from any debris or precipitation that has formed during freeze thaw process.",
    "Check the protein concentration (NanoDrop 2000c, Thermo Fisher Sci). The first time the protein concentration is checked it should be calculated using Bradford solution and a standard curve using BSA at known concentrations. With the standard curve, it is possible to determine the unknown concentration of the BRPF1PZP protein. The calculated protein concentration by Bradford solution can be compared to that found using the extinction coefficient (extinction coefficient determined from the protein sequence). If using the extinction coefficient is an accurate method to determine BRPF1PZP concentration, future protein concentration calculations can be completed using this method.\nDilute protein to 0.1–0.2 mM using Purification Buffer C (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, and 5 mM DTT) and Purification Buffer D (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT), bringing the salt concentration of the buffer to 150 mM NaCl. Final buffer for NMR sample is 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT.\nCombine 198 μL sample with 22 μL of D2O (final concentration of 10%), mix gently up and down with a pipette.\nUsing a glass pipette (Wilmad Labglass) gently pipette into a shigemi tube (Shigemi, Inc.). Once all the sample is added, insert the plunger, remove all bubbles by gently rotating the plunger up and down and seal with parafilm.\nRecord 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the apo-state of the protein at 298K on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/603-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of the apo-state of BRPF1PZP\nGood dispersion of resonances indicates that the protein is folded.\nFor titration, add increasing amounts of the histone H3 (aa 1-12, 15-34, or 1-31) peptide (synthesized by Synpeptide) to the NMR sample and record 1H,15N HSQC spectra after each addition of the ligand.",
    "Continue to repeat the previous step until saturation is reached.\nUse NMRPipe software (Delaglio et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) to process the spectra. To analyze chemical shift perturbations induced in BRPF1PZP, overlay the spectra.\nX-ray crystallization and structure determination of H3-linked BRPF1PZP\nTiming: approx. 1 month\nGenerate crystals of H3-linked BRPF1PZP, collect crystallization data sets, and determine the structure of the complex.\nPrepare and concentrate the H3-GSGSS-BRPF1PZP protein as above (> 20 mg/mL) in Purification Buffer B (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT).\nDilute protein with Purification Buffer C (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, and 5 mM DTT) to approx. 6 mg/mL to final buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT). Spin down the protein at 15,000 × g in an Eppendorf Microcentrifuge 5424R (Eppendorf) to remove any precipitation before setting up crystal drops.\nGrow crystals at 18°C using the sitting-drop diffusion method.\nSet up crystal screening trays using commercially available kits (Hampton Research).\nEach well is composed of 90% of the well condition (0.2 M calcium acetate, PEG8000 10% (w/v), and 0.1 M imidazole pH 8) and 10% additive from the commercially available additive screen (Hampton Research).\nSet up drops by combing 0.6 μL of protein with 0.6 μL of well solution.\nAdd 1.2 μL of a 60% (v/v) glycerol solution directly to the drop (final concentration of 30% (v/v)). With an appropriate loop size, loop the crystal and mount directly on the homesource (Anschutz Medical Campus X-ray crystallography core facility Rigaku Micromax 007 high frequency microfocus X-ray generator equipped with a Pilatus 200K 2D area detector).",
    "Optional: Additional well and glycerol solution can be added if the drop dries out slightly, however maintain cryoprotectant percentage of 30% (v/v) glycerol. Crystals can be frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage or shipping to a synchrotron.\nCollect X-ray diffraction data sets using a single crystal using a Rigaku Micromax 007 high-frequency microfocus X-ray generator.\nAlternatives: Collecting data at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 4.2.2, or alternative synchrotron is another option.\nUse HKL3000 program (Minor et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]) to complete the indexing, integration and scaling of the data set.\nAlternatives: X-ray Detector Software (XDS) (Kabsch, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) can be an alternative for processing.\nDetermine the initial structure by molecular replacement using the apo BRPF1pzp (PDB ID: 5ERC) as a model in the Phenix Phaser program (Adams et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCarry out manual model building and refinement with Coot (Emsley et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) and Phenix (Liebschner et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nValidate the structure with MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) and Worldwide Protein Data Bank OneDep SYSTEM (https://validate-rcsb-1.wwpdb.org/[href=https://validate-rcsb-1.wwpdb.org/]) (Berman et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), and fix any issues that arise. These servers provide a report that have details about the quality of model and experimental data. For example, information contained in these reports can be used to determine if a ligand needs work or protein side chains are in an incorrect conformation.\nNote: Additional validation servers are available depending on need and issues. All structures that are deposited with the PDB will go through the validation server, thus a preliminary check is helpful before depositing. Currently, many journals are requesting these reports as part of the manuscript submission process for anyone who submits a structure, so developing a good understanding of the validation system will help authors.",
    "Deposit data with the Worldwide Protein Data Bank OneDep SYSTEM (https://deposit-2.wwpdb.org/deposition/[href=https://deposit-2.wwpdb.org/deposition/]) and record PDB ID (Berman et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)\nTiming: 2–4 h\nElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs) are used to detect binding of two molecules through an observed change in electrophoretic mobility.\nNote: To save time, reactions can be started while gel is pre-running.\nUsing EMSA reaction buffer prepare BRPF1PZP running samples. Separately, dilute NCPs in 0.5× TE, and store everything on ice.\nFor BRPF1PZP, make 150, 100, 50, 30, 10, 3, and 1 μM running samples from the protein stock. Make 12 μL of each sample.\nPrepare 20 μL of 30 nM NCPs.\nNote: Concentration of BRPF1PZP in the running samples should cover at least 2 orders of magnitude of the dissociation constant for the protein-NCP interaction in order to reach saturation.\nMix BRPF1PZP samples with NCP and incubate at 4°C for 15 min.\nCombine 2 μL of NCPs with 10 μL of each BRPF1PZP sample to start the reactions. For zero BRPF1PZP concentration, 10 μL of Reaction Buffer is added instead.\nLoad reaction mixtures onto a gel and run electrophoresis at 300V for 1.5 h in 0.3× TBE.\nStart the gel running and then quickly load the reaction mixtures.\nImage the gel using a Typhoon phosphorimager with fluorescence imaging to detect fluorescein emission around 470 nm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/603-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. EMSA with NCP207 incubated with increasing amounts of wild-type BRPF1PZP",
    "Note: If a phosphorimager is unavailable, it is possible to stain the gel with Ethidium Bromide and image it on a UV transilluminator. To do so, add 10 μL initially of 10 mg/mL EtBr to 1 L of 0.3× TBE and incubate the gel in the EtBr + 0.3× TBE bath for 2 h. Then image the gel via 365 nm UV light. If no bands are observed, then add 5 μL more 10 mg/mL EtBr to the TBE bath and incubate the gel longer.\nCritical: As with BME, EtBr is highly toxic and can be readily absorbed through the skin. Gloves are absolutely essential when handling EtBr solutions and nitrile rubber gloves are preferred over latex gloves. Handling EtBr solutions should be done in a chemical hood and wearing full body PPE while doing so is recommended.\nFluorescence polarization (FP)\nTiming: 3–5 h\nFluorescence polarization (FP) is used to measure binding of a fluorescently labeled molecule to another molecule while exciting the fluorescently labeled molecule with polarized light.\nUsing fluorescence polarization reaction buffer, prepare BRPF1PZP samples (also prepare one set of samples for background measurements). Separately, dilute NCPs in 0.5× TE, and store everything on ice.\nPrepare 30 μL of 150, 100, 50, 30, 10, 3, and 1 μM of BRPF1PZP running samples from the protein stock.\nPrepare 70 μL of 50 nM NCPs.\nNote: Concentration of BRPF1PZP in the running samples should cover at least 2 orders of magnitude of the dissociation constant for the protein-NCP interaction in order to reach saturation.\nMix BRPF1PZP samples with NCP and incubate at 4°C for 30 min\nMix 3 μL of NCP with 27 μL of BRPF1PZP samples to start the reactions. For zero BRPF1PZP concentration, 27 μL of reaction buffer is used instead.",
    "For background measurements use 3 μL of 0.5× TE instead of the NCP sample.\nPlace reaction mixtures into wells of the Costar black plate.\nLoad plate into the Tecan plate reader.\nInitialize i-control and use the fluorescence module to design a protocol that will measure fluorescence polarization of each reaction by exciting the samples in the wells with 470 nm polarized light and measuring emission at 520 nm (for fluorescein) using the following settings:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_603_52.csv\nNote: Since the determination of dissociation constants in a fluorescence polarization binding assay is insensitive to the absolute polarization values measured, calibrating the G-factor is not important for the purpose of this method.\nMake sure the protocol outputs raw data of the polarized emission light intensity parallel and perpendicular to the plane of excitation. Then run the protocol.\nNote: If the fluorescence polarization binding assay is outputting data with large deviations between data points, consider increasing the reaction volume. Stirring the reaction mixtures in wells with a pipette tip to make sure they are sitting evenly in the wells may help as well.\nExport the data.\nAnalyze the data using preferred graphing software (GraphPad Prism, Origin, Gnuplot, etc) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/603-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Binding curve obtained for the interaction of wild-type BRPF1PZP with NCP207\nLiquid in vitro HAT assay\nTiming: 1 day\nLiquid in vitro HAT assays were performed in a final volume of 15 μl using 0.5 μg of purified free histones or H1-depleted short oligonucleosomes from HeLa cells as substrate.\nCritical: The quality of free histone or short oligonucleosomes should be monitored by Coomassie staining before HAT assays.\nMix free histone or short oligonucleosome with 3 μl of purified BRPF1 complex, 3 μl of HAT buffer 5×, 1 mM Na butyrate and 50 mM of KCl or NaCl.",
    "Note: For the best results, the total salt concentration (KCl +NaCl) should be between 50 and 100 mM.\nKeep the reaction mixture on ice for 15 min.\nAdd 0.125 μCi of 3H labeled Ac-CoA (0.1 mCi/mL).\nIncubate the mixture at 30°C for 30 min.\nSpot the reactions on P81 filter paper (St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research).\nAir dry the filter paper and wash 3 times in 50 mM carbonate buffer (NaHCO3–NaCO3, pH 9.2).\nRinse rapidly with acetone and air dry the filter paper.\nPlace the filter paper in scintillation tube (Fisher).\nAdd scintillation cocktail (MP Biomedicals) and measure counts in scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter) for 30 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/603-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. HAT activity of the native wild-type and mutant MORF complexes from K562 cells on histones\nLiquid HAT assays, in which reactions were spotted on P81 filters and counted by scintillation as counts per minute (CPM).\nCritical: In HAT assays, we used FLAG-MORFN1-716 instead of full-length MORF because transfection of full-length protein leads to substantial degradation.\nCritical: It is critical to purify the MORF enzyme with its associated subunits, BRPF1, ING5 and MEAF6, because the catalytic activity and substrate selectivity depend on these subunits."
