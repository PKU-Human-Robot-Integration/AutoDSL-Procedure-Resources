    "Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that requires a crRNA for targeting to a specific genomic site (Figs. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0001]-3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0003] and Supporting Information, Table S3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#support-information-section]; Jinek et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0015]). The crRNA consists of a sequence of 20 nt homologous to the targeted genomic region (spacer sequence; Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0003]) and a nonvariable sequence (repeat sequence). The spacer sequence is designed in function of the targeted genomic region and must be upstream of a so-called protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) in the targeted genomic region. The PAM for the Cas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes (spyCas9) is the trinucleotide NGG (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0003]). The nonvariable repeat sequence of the crRNA is necessary to bind to a second RNA called the tracrRNA. The tracrRNA is a nonvariable RNA molecule that contains a sequence complementary to the crRNA repeat sequence and a sequence required to bind Cas9 protein. The same tracrRNA is used for all experiments; only the crRNA needs to be custom designed. Because single gRNAs (combined crRNA and tracrRNA in one molecule; Jinek et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0015]) are longer than crRNAs and thus more expensive to synthesize, they are not recommended for this protocol.\nMaterials\nMilli-Q-filtered H2O, sterile (stored at room temperature)\nUltrapure 1 M Tris·Cl buffer, pH 7.5 (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 15567027) and 5 mM working solution (diluted in sterile Milli-Q-filtered H2O and stored at room temperature)\nCustom-synthesized crRNA (e.g., Integrated DNA Technologies [IDT] Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA)\ntracrRNA (e.g., IDT CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA)\n1. Identify the best site for GFP insertion for your particular locus. A C-terminal fusion is often considered least likely to interfere with possible localization sequences that are often located at the N terminus. N-terminal and internal insertion sites can also be considered as long as functional domains are not disturbed.",
    "We recommend identifying protein domains using online resources such as SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/[href=http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/]) in order to choose an insertion site that will not disturb an essential domain (Letunic & Bork, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0020]).\n2. Design the crRNA following these guidelines:\n         \nChoose a crRNA that will cause Cas9 to cleave the genomic DNA as close as possible to the desired GFP insertion site. Cas9 will generate a blunt cut 3 bp upstream of the PAM sequence. For best results, we recommend staying within a window of ±10 bp from the edit (Paix, Folkmann, Goldman, et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0026]).\nWhen possible, choose a crRNA containing a guanine nucleotide immediately before the PAM. Avoid having a cytosine at that position (Doench et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0008]).\nA GC content of 50%-70% GC in the crRNA spacer sequence also improves cutting efficiency (Gagnon et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0011]).\nMake sure that the crRNA targets a unique sequence (20 bp) and has few, if any, predicted off-target potential editing sites. Generally, two or more mismatches within the 10 bp upstream of the PAM sequence are sufficient to avoid targeting by Cas9. We recommend using online resources to identify potential off-target sites for crRNAs (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design[href=https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design]; Doench et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0007]).\n3. Order the crRNA: Several commercial sources are available, including IDT Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA. Two nanomoles is sufficient for 60 experiments using lipofection or six experiments using nucleofection. If more experiments are planned, order 10 nmol. Use the provider's website to enter the desired sequence (with IDT, only the 20-nt spacer sequence needs to be entered; do not include the PAM or repeat sequence). Briefly spin the crRNA in a bench microcentrifuge at room temperature and add 30.8 µl 5 mM Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, to the 2 nmol of crRNA provided (final concentration: 65 µM). Mix well by pipetting and store at −80°C.",
    "4. Order the tracrRNA: Use the same provider as for your crRNA to make sure that the crRNA and tracrRNA will be able to pair. Twenty nanomoles is sufficient for 600 experiments using lipofection or 60 experiments using nucleofection. Briefly spin the tracrRNA in a bench microcentrifuge at room temperature and add 308 µl 5 mM Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, to the 20 nmol of tracrRNA provided (final concentration: 65 µM). Mix well by pipetting and store at −80°C.",
    "Insertion of a fluorescent reporter is achieved using a linear donor DNA that will function as a template to repair the Cas9-induced break through homology-directed repair (Paix, Folkmann, Goldman, et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0026]). Linear donors are synthesized in the lab using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or can be purchased as gene fragments (e.g., IDT gBlocks; Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-prot-0003]).\nThe donor template consists of the insert (the coding sequence of GFP or other fluorescent protein) and sequences homologous to genomic sequences on the left and right sides of the desired site of insertion (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0003]; Paix, Folkmann, Goldman, et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0026]; Paix, Folkmann, & Seydoux, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0028]). Use the genomic sequence (not the cDNA sequence) when designing the donor template, as the cutting site can be close to an exon/intron junction. In addition, we recommend the following.\n         \nThe insert should be <1 kb in length, as editing frequency decreases significantly with increasing insert size (Paix, Folkmann, Goldman, et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0026]). Most fluorescent proteins are small enough to fit this size restriction (e.g., GFP without start and stop codons is 714 bp; Supporting Information, File S1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#support-information-section]).\nThe insertion site should be as close as possible to the site of Cas9-induced cleavage (Paix, Folkmann, Goldman, et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0026]; Paquet et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0032]). The sequence between the Cas9 cleavage site and the insertion site is homologous to the genomic region targeted (internal homology) and should be recoded with silent mutations to prevent premature recombination that would result in low insertion efficiency of the fluorescent reporter gene (incomplete editing; Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0003]; Paix, Folkmann, Goldman, et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0026]).",
    "Make sure that the donor template cannot be cut by Cas9. Mutations in the PAM sequence or in the sequence immediately upstream of the PAM in the crRNA spacer sequence are generally sufficient to prevent cleavage by Cas9 (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0003]; Hsu et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0013]). Note that spyCas9 also weakly cleaves sequences with NAG or NGA PAMs, so avoid recoding the PAM to NAG or NGA (Kleinstiver et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0016]).\nWe recommend testing the donor template in silico by translating the predicted cDNA fusion in order to rule out any unwanted codon changes or frameshifts due to errors in the design of the donor template (use cloning software or online resources such as https://web.expasy.org/translate/[href=https://web.expasy.org/translate/]; Gasteiger, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0012]).\nMaterials\n∼50-100 ng of plasmid containing desired fluorescent protein sequence at ∼100 ng/µl in H2O (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0007] and Supporting Information File S1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#support-information-section]), from a standard miniprep of 1.5 ml bacterial culture (100 ng/µl in H2O)\nPhusion Taq polymerase master mix with buffer HF and DMSO aliquots (NEB, cat. no.

    "Agarose minigel electrophoresis system (e.g., Fisher Scientific 14-955-170)\nNanoDrop spectrophotometer (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific ND-1000)\n1. Design the PCR primers: Design forward and reverse primers containing ∼19 nt homologous to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the desired fluorescent protein coding sequence. Add the homology arms (35-40 nt of sequence flanking the edit and cleavage site) to the 5′ end of each primers and, if necessary, for one primer, add the sequence including silent mutations between the edit and the cleavage site (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0003]). Purchase or synthesize the primers (e.g., 25 nmol from IDT, desalted), reconstitute each primer at 100 µM with Milli-Q-purified water, and store at −20°C.\n2. Prepare PCR master mix: In a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, mix 0.8 µl template plasmid, 2 µl each of 100 µM stocks of the forward and the reverse primers, 200 µl 2× Phusion Master mix, and 195.2 µl H2O. Vortex, and then split the mix into a PCR strip with eight tubes (50 µl per tubes).\n3. Run PCR as follows:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nInitial step:,2 min,98°C,(denaturation)\n30 cycles:,30 s,98°C,(amplification)\n,30 s,61.5°C,\n,45 s,72°C,\nFinal step:,10 min,72°C,(elongation)\nHold at 4°C.,Hold at 4°C.,Hold at 4°C.,Hold at 4°C.\n4. Analyze PCR products: Add 10 µl 6× Orange G loading dye to the 50-µl PCR reaction and run 8 µl on a 1.5% agarose minigel.\nWe found that most primers work well at an annealing temperature of 61.5°C. However, if the PCR reactions have a low yield or produce nonspecific gel bands, run a gradient PCR from 60°C to 72°C to determine the optimal annealing temperature. We also found that adding 3% DMSO (1.5 µl per 50-µl PCR reaction) can improve the specificity/yield of PCR reactions.",
    "5. Purify PCR products: Pool the eight PCR reactions together in a 15-ml Falcon tube, add 2 ml buffer PB, and vortex. Place 750 µl in a MinElute column and spin 1 min at 16,200 × g (13,000 rpm), room temperature, on a bench centrifuge. Discard the flowthrough and repeat twice using the same column. Wash the column with 750 µl PE buffer (containing ethanol), spin, and discard flowthrough. Re-spin the column empty. Carefully remove the column from the collection tube and place in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 10 µl of H2O in the middle of the column membrane (do not touch it). Wait 1-5 min and spin again. Discard the column and keep the tube containing the purified PCR donor.\nIt is not necessary to digest away the template plasmid as long as the plasmid does not contain sequence that could drive expression of the fluorescent protein and lead to false positives.\nWe do not recommend using agarose gel purification, as this procedure results in impure and low-yield DNA preparations.\n6. Determine the concentration using 1 µl purified PCR on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The expected concentration is 0.8-1.3 µg/µl.",
    "As an alternative to PCR fragments (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-prot-0002]), commercial synthesized gene fragments can be used as donors (e.g., gBlocks from IDT). gBlocks can be purchased commercially, but typically are provided in a limited quantity (1 µg for 751-1000 bp gBlocks, sufficient for one editing experiment).\nAdditional Materials (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-prot-0002])\nGene fragment (e.g., IDT gBlock)\n1.

The sequence complexity of the homology arms may prevent efficient gBlock synthesis. If so, extend the length of the homology arms while maintaining the total size of the gBlock at <1 kb (to obtain a yield of 1 µg).\n2. Order the gBlock (e.g., IDT): 1 µg, no 5′ phosphate group. Upon receiving the gBlock, do not reconstitute; simply store as is at room temperature.",
    "Relatively large amounts of spyCas9 protein are required for each editing experiment (80 µg/experiment for nucleofection and 8 µg/experiment for lipofection). Cas9 can be purchased from commercial suppliers, but it is also straightforward to purify in the laboratory.

Mis-insertion indicates rare events where the wrong tag was inserted at either locus. Because each editing event is independent, co-edits are rare but do occur. In the example shown, a few co-targeted cells are visible (red and green in same cell). (B) Experiment targeting the same locus (Lamin A/C, HEK293T cells) with GFP and RFP. This approach can be used to generate cells where the targeted locus is tagged with GFP or RFP in one experiment.

    "We recommend the following guidelines for tissue culture handling:\n         \nSterile conditions: It is important to work under sterile conditions when manipulating cell lines and culture reagents. We use antibiotic (Pen/Strep) in the cell culture medium after cell transformation because the Cas9, crRNA, tracrRNA, and donor DNA may not be sterile.\nCell adherence: HEK293T, DLD1 and U2OS are adherent cells. They can be detached using trypsin treatment. An incubation of 1-2 min followed by pipetting will be enough for HEK293T cells, whereas up to 7-10 min will be necessary for DLD1 and U2OS cells. HEK293T can also be partially detached by routine pipetting, and thus with these cells it is necessary to exercise caution when changing medium.\nCell passaging: We limit the number of cell passages to minimize any genetic drift (Liu et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0023]).

Equilibrate the cell culture reagents (medium with FBS, PBS, and trypsin) at room temperature.",
    "2. At 60-72 hr post cell transformation, the cells can be analyzed for fluorescent signal. Wash one well containing the transformed cells with 1 ml PBS.\n3. Add 1 ml trypsin and resuspend the cells.\nNontransformed cells are used as control.\n4. Transfer the resuspended cells in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 500 µl culture medium.\n5. Spin down the cells for 3 min at 350 × g (1815 rpm with FA-45-30-11 rotor), room temperature.\n6. Remove supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 ml PBS.\n7. Briefly vortex resuspended cells in PBS and immediately transfer 400 µl into a 1.5-ml tube without a cap.\n8. Run appropriate cleaning and calibration procedures through the cytometer. Set the cytometer to detect the fluorescent reporter of interest.\n9. Run nonfluorescent cells (nontransformed cells) to determine the fluorescence background and to check the cytometer parameters.\n10. Measure the fluorescent reporter expression in the transformed cells. We recommend analyzing 10,000 cells per sample, vortex the cells before every run. If the cells concentration exceeds 1500 cells/µl, dilute in PBS.\n11. Analyze the results: Determine the cell population to analyze on the negative control, and count fluorescent cells. We recommend setting a background threshold where <0.1% of the cells in the negative control are counted as GFP positive (false positive rate; Figs. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0004]-6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-fig-0006]).\nAnalyze the expression pattern of the fluorescent reporter using microscopy\n12. Equilibrate the PBS/formaldehyde solution at room temperature.\n13. At 60-72 hr post cell transformation, the cells can be analyzed for fluorescent signal. From the culture well containing a coverslip with cells grown on it, transfer the coverslip to a fresh 6-well plate containing PBS.\nNontransformed cells are used as control.\n14. Remove the PBS and incubate 1 hr with PBS/formaldehyde solution.\n15. Wash with PBS.",
    "16. Wash with PBS/0.25% Triton for 5 min, and then again with PBS.\n17. Mount coverslips on microscope slides using antifade mounting medium (containing DAPI). If necessary, remove excess PBS from the coverslip with paper tissue before mounting.\n18. Seal with clear fingernail polish.\n19. Analyze cells for fluorescent reporter expression by fluorescent microscopy. The total number of cells can be determined using the DAPI nuclear dye contained in the mounting medium.\nCell sort using FACS\n20. Equilibrate cell culture reagents to room temperature.\n21. Harvest edited cell population using trypsin (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-prot-0007]) and resuspend in PBS + Pen/Strep at 1 × 106 cells/ml.\nNon-transformed cells are used as control.\n22. Prepare two 96-well plates for cell cloning (two plates are generally enough to recover >75 viable clones) with 100 µl of culture medium + Pen/Strep in each well. If the sorted cells are pooled together instead of cloned in plate wells, prepare a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 500 ml culture medium with Pen/Strep.\n23. Filter the cells with cell strainers and keep the tubes on ice.\n24. Sort the fluorescence-positive cells according to the FACS instructions.\n25. Incubate the plates in a cell incubator. After 72 hr, add 125 µl culture medium with Pen/Strep to each well. If the sorted cells have been pooled in a single tube, transfer the contents of the tube into a well of a 6-well plate containing 1.5 ml culture medium with Pen/Strep, and change culture medium 3 days later (again using culture medium with Pen/Strep).\n26. Genotype single-cell clones using PCR primers. Use primers from outside the donor sequence to avoid false positives from off-target insertions (Won & Dawid, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpmb.102#cpmb102-bib-0034]).\nPooled sorted cells can be analyzed by microscopy or subcloned if necessary.\nCell freezing",
