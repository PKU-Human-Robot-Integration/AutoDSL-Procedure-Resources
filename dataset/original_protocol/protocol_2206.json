No need to change the culture medium during the treatment. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1815-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Increased SA-β-gal-positivity in senescent cells\nRepresentative staining images of SA-β-gal (colored blue) in non-induced and senescent cells treated with doxorubicin (150 ng/mL) for 5 or 10 days. Scale bar, 100 μM.\nCritical: Although cellular senescence is induced in cells treated with doxorubicin for 5 days as seen in the senescence markers including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), and Lamin B1 in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], SA-β-gal positivity is still not fully increased compared with cells treated for 10 days (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (Yamamoto-Imoto et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Therefore, we recommend to investigate in both situations to decide which is suitable state for your experiments. Duration of doxorubicin treatment can be changed if the possibility remains that alternative time points could lead to differences in your data.\nSample preparation to evaluate the senescent state\nTiming: 1 h\nBefore exploring autophagic activity, senescent state should be determined by SA-β-gal staining and Western blot for p21, LAMP1, and Lamin B1.\nNote: Since senescent cells show enlarged cell size (Bent et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Druelle et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), observing using normal microscopy can easily help to determine when to evaluate senescent state. These morphological changes are seen in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].",
    "At 10 days after the treatment of doxorubicin, prepare samples for SA-β-gal staining and Western blot.\nPrepare the samples for SA-β-gal staining using Senescence Cells Histochemical Staining Kit (Sigma, CS0030).\nWash each dish with 2 mL of PBS, then remove the wash solution.\nAdd 2 mL of 1× Fixation Buffer and incubate for 7 min at room temperature.\nWash each dish 3 times with 2 mL of PBS.\nPause point: After step 4.a.iii. samples can be stored in PBS at 4°C for a week.\nPrepare the samples for Western blot.\nWash each well twice with 2 mL of cold-PBS, then remove the wash solution.\nAdd 25 μL of lysis buffer and scrape each well on ice.\nNote: The amount of lysis buffer depends on the cell number. A suggested amount of lysis buffer is 25–100 μL.\nPipette 7 times to lyse well, and then transfer to a microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nMeasure the protein concentration using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit as described in https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23225[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/23225].\nAdjust the protein concentration among all samples using lysis buffer and mix well with 5× SDS-sample buffer.\nHeat them at 95°C for 7 min, and then place the tube at room temperature for 5 min.\nPause point: Samples at steps 4.b.v. and 4.b.viii. can be stored at ≤−80°C and ≤−20°C until use, respectively.\nEvaluation of the senescent state\nSA-β-gal staining\nTiming: 2 days\nTransfer the micro cover glass with the fixed cells from step 4.a.iii. into 24-well plate filled with PBS.\nRemove the PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of Staining mixture including X-gal Solution (Sigma, CS00030).\nSeal the plate with Parafilm.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 16–20 h without CO2.",
    "Note: Appropriate staining time should to be optimized in each types of cell using microscope.\nWash the cells three times with 1 mL of PBS.\nCover with Mounting Medium with DAPI (VECTASHIELD, H-1200) and observe the cells on DIC and DAPI images with Olympus cellSens Standard Imaging Software using microscope (100× magnification, BX53, Olympus). Count more than 200 DAPI-positive cells manually, and calculate the percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells per condition in each experiment. Please refer to (Yamamoto-Imoto et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nOptional: Cellular Senescence Plate Assay Kit -SPiDER-βGal (SG05, Dojindo) and Cell Count Normalization Kit (C544, Dojindo) can be useful alternatives to assess SA-β-gal positivity (https://dojindo.com/product/cellular-senescence-plate-assay-kit-spider-aygal-sg05/[href=https://dojindo.com/product/cellular-senescence-plate-assay-kit-spider-aygal-sg05/]).\nSDS-PAGE and western blot\nTiming: 2 days\nFor more details, please see Yamamoto-Imoto et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10].\nLysates are run on reducing SDS-PAGE gels.\nNote: Load 10–20 μg of total protein, but less amount of total protein can be used when senescence is markedly induced.\nBlot the protein to PVDF membrane and stained with Ponceau S to confirm the proteins are equally blotted among samples.\nBlocking with 1% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature.\nIncubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody.\nIncubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for an hour.\nBlots are developed with Immobilon Forte Western HRP Substrate or ImmunoStar LD.\nSignals are detected in ChemiDocTM Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nNote: After washing the membrane with TBST and ddH2O, dried membrane can be stored at room temperature to reuse for detecting other senescence markers.",
    "Critical: Because senescence is highly complex and heterogenous (Gorgoulis et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), various senescent phenotypes should be confirmed as described in (Kohli et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Especially, Cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial dysfunction should be assessed, for example by using Click-iT® EdU Imaging Kit (Invitrogen, C10337) and XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit that includes Oligomycin, FCCP, and Rotenone/Antimycin A (Agilent Technologies, 103015-100), respectively (Yamamoto-Imoto et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nDetection of autophagic activity\nTiming: 3 h\nAlthough this protocol describes the specific steps to assess autophagy in DNA damage-induced senescent cells, we have also used this protocol in the replicative senescence model. It is definitely important to compare the expression of LC3-II between the cells treated with or without bafilomycin A1, which is the inhibitor of the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome as described in (Mizushima et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Although confirming the LC3 expression level using microscope might be one of the indicators related to the autophagic activity, it still remain unclear that increased levels of LC3-II is due to the upregulation of autophagosome formation or inhibition of autophagic degradation of LC3-II.\nDilute the bafilomycin A1 stock solution or DMSO 1:1250 in culture medium to obtain the bafilomycin A1 (the final concentration is 200 nM) or DMSO solution.\nWash each well twice with 2 mL of PBS, then remove the wash solution.\nAdd 2 mL of culture medium with bafilomycin A1 or DMSO solution.\nIncubate the cells for 2 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber.\nPrepare the samples by the same method as step. 4.b.\nPerform SDS-PAGE and Western blot for LC3 as described above. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nNote: Performing SDS-PAGE in 15% gel is better to detect LC3-II.",
    "Optional: Increased levels of Rubicon can be the useful indicator of decreased autophagic activity (Yamamoto-Imoto et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Matsunaga et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nOptional: Measuring the expression levels of p62, which interact with autophagic substrates, with or without bafilomycin A1 is also used to explore autophagic activity."
