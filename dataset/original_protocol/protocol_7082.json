Gel Electrophoresis (see Notes 11 and 12)Set up the hrCNE gel in a cold room (4°C) with the pre-chilled cathode and anode buffers prepared in Procedure C.Pre-run gel at 100 V for 20 min to allow the detergent to enter the gel.Place the 1.5 ml microfuge tubes from Steps D2 or E3 in a microfuge pre-chilled to 4°C.Spin at 16,100 × g for 10 min at 4°C in the microcentrifuge (Eppendorf 5415R).Load 20 μl of each reaction supernatant into the wells. This can be a challenging step and may take some practice because no loading dye is used.Run the gel at 200 V for 3.5 h.",
    "Image the gel by in-gel fluorescenceGently separate the gel from glass plates and rinse three times in ddH2O.Image with the BioRad ChemiDoc MP imager, using the blot/UV/stain-free imaging plate.Preset program: ProQ Emerald 488 for EGFP fluorescence.Exposure times vary depending on band intensity. For quantitative gels, the optimal exposure time was determined and all gels were imaged for the same time; 80-120 s is a reasonable starting point.Quantify band intensity using the Bio-Rad Image laboratory softwareTutorial videos are available from Bio-Rad on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV_P47ScoYo&list=PLrAEgIY86I6zytNeMPGBhvXnKIm5MS-6J&index=3&t=8s[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV_P47ScoYo&list=PLrAEgIY86I6zytNeMPGBhvXnKIm5MS-6J&index=3&t=8s].Use the Image tools to straighten/rotate the image as needed.Use the lane and band tool to define lanes and select bandsManually assign 10 lanes and adjust the lanes to align with the gel.Use the “add bands” function to select bands for all dimer and quaternary complex bands.In the area where the bands are not easily visible, you can look at the lane profile tool to see faint bands.Use the lane profile view to select/adjust the width of the band peaks.Background can be adjusted and excluded as needed, by using the background selection.Review the width for each band and adjust as needed. Pay attention to band widths, to ensure that they are uniform.Export data using the analyze data function."
