    "This method required the use of animal subjects, allowed by Laval University Animal Ethics Committee (protocol # 2012-170).\n1. Setup and Preparation\nSolutions\n\t\nPrepare aCSF stock solutions according to the following recipes 7,17. Other recipes with concentration variations are available in the literature. Store stock solutions at 4 °C for up to one month.\n\t\t\nSalt solution: add 75.39 g of NaCl (129 mM final); 2.5 g of KCl (3.35 mM final); 0.81 g of NaH2PO4 (0.58 mM final); 2.33 g of MgCl2 (1.15 mM final); 1.85 g of CaCl2 (1.26 mM). Dissolve in 800 ml of distilled water then fill to 1 L with distillated water.\nBicarbonate solution: add 17.65 g of NaHCO3 (21 mM final). Dissolve in 900 ml of distillated water then fill to 1 L with distilled water. Variations of the bicarbonate concentration will result in pH variations.\nGlucose solution: add 54.06 g of glucose (30 mM final). Dissolve in 400 ml of distillated water then fill to 500 ml with distilled water.\nPrepare aCSF by diluting 100 ml of salt solution, 100 ml of bicarbonate solution, and 50 ml of glucose solution in 1 L of distilled water. Store at 4 °C until use.\nPrepare a glass electrode by warming and stretching a glass tube until it breaks. Sand down the tip before use. The electrode can be reused many time as long as it stays clean.\nExperimental Setup\n\tNote: The set-up details are presented in Figure 2.\n\t\nTurn on the amplifier, moving averager, data acquisition system, temperature controller and pump. Check the signal amplification (gain = 10,000), the filtration (low threshold, 10 Hz; high threshold, 5 kHz), and the sampling rate of the analog to digital conversion of the raw signal (2.5 kHz).",
    "Fill a bottle with aCSF and bubble it with carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2). Induce a bubbled- and warmed-aCSF flow in the recording chamber (volume 5 ml) at 4 ml/min. Hold the temperature in the recording chamber at 26 (± 1) °C. pH should be 7.4 in these standard conditions.\nKeep 50 ml of RT and carbogen-bubbled aCSF in a 50 ml syringe near the dissection chamber.\nTurn on the computer and start the recording software.\n2. Dissection\nWeigh and visually determine the sex of the animal (males have a longer ano-genital distance, while females have a short ano-genital distance; males genitals are often dark while female genitals are pink).\nAnesthetize the newborn rodents by one of the following options: cryoanesthesia (completely immerse the animal in ice for 4 – 5 min 18), injection (equitensine at 4 ml/kg) 19 or inhalation of volatile anesthetics (isoflurane 20 or ether 21). Confirm an adequate plane of anesthesia by the absence of a paw withdrawal reflex.\nPlace the animal on the bench, ventral face down. Section the rostral part of the head coronally with a scalpel at the bregma level (visible through the skin and skull). Perform this step immediately after the animal is anesthetized.\nSection the body coronally with a scalpel under the anterior members .\nRemove skin, muscles, fatty tissues and viscus with surgical and thin scissors and pliers. Since bones are soft at this age, be cautious to not damage the nervous system. Perform this step on the bench.\nPlace the preparation in the dissection chamber. Use the aCSF stored in the syringe to oxygenate the preparation. From this point to the end of the recording, use a microscope.",
    "On the dorsal face of the preparation, cut the skull and vertebras from the rostral to the caudal part along the medium axis with surgical and thin scissors and pliers. Open the cut skull and vertebras in order to expose the nervous tissue. Use the aCSF strored in the syringe to oxygenate the preparation.\nWith the pliers, remove the Arachnoid membrane, a thin tissue covering the surface of the nervous tissue. Retain the pia mater and blood vessels against the nervous tissue. Use the aCSF stored in the syringe to oxygenate the preparation.\nPlace the preparation with the dorsal face down, and carefully bring down the brainstem and spinal cord by cutting the nerves and connective tissue with the scissors while holding the preparation in place. A dorsal approach is also possible. Keep the roots and nerves as long as possible. Remove the bones to isolate the brainstem and spinal cord. Use the aCSF stored in the syringe to oxygenate the preparation.\nRemove the cerebellum and remaining rostral structures by sectioning them with the scalpel. Use the aCSF stored in the needle to oxygenate the preparation.\nOptionally depending on experimental design, remove the pons with the scalpel by a coronal section anterior to the inferior cerebellar artery 22. Note that keeping the whole pons will slow down the rhythm in rats and fully inhibit it in mice. Preparations that include only the caudal part of the pons display a respiratory-like activity with a stable frequency at the C4 root.\n3. Recording\nPlace the preparation in the recording chamber, ventral face up. Fix the preparation with pins in the lowest part of the spinal cord and rostral-most part of the brainstem.",
    "Using a syringe linked to the electrode by its needle, induce a depression in the electrode (glass tip diameter: 150 - 225 µm) by pulling out the syringe piston, in order to partially fill the electrode with aCSF.\nUsing a micromanipulator, carefully place the electrode close to one of the fourth ventral roots. Other ventral roots could also present a respiratory-like activity (e.g., XII cranial nerve, C1 ventral root).\nInduce a depression in the electrode tank via the syringe by pulling out the piston in order to gently aspirate the nerve rootlet. Then carefully move the electrode to apply it against the spinal cord.\n\tNote: Ideally the size of the rootlet matches the size of the electrode opening and thus creates a seal between the internal and external compartments of the electrode. Since differential amplifiers are commonly used for such recordings, any opening between the inside of the electrode and the recording chamber reduces the quality of the signal and makes it difficult to eliminate background noise.\nStart the recording.\nRecord the rhythm produced by the preparation under normoxic conditions (i.e., aCSF bubbled with carbogen: 95% O2 and 5% CO2) for at least 20 min to determine the baseline parameters of the preparation.\nSwitch the perfusion from carbogen-bubbled aCSF to stimulus aCSF (i.e., bubbled with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 for hypoxia stimulus) for 15 min. Alter exposure duration depending of the experimental protocol. Record the exposure duration on the recording and animal datasheet. Use stainless steel tubes between the aCSF bottle and the chamber whenever possible to avoid gas diffusion to the outside of the tube.\nSwitch the perfusion back to standard carbogen-bubbled aCSF for at least 15 min for a recovery recording. Record this on the recording and animal datasheet.\nEnd the recording.\n4. Statistical Analysis",
    "From the integrated signal, calculate the frequency as the number of bursts per minute (expressed in bursts/min), the amplitude as the difference between the baseline and the peak of the burst (expressed in mV), the burst duration as the duration from the beginning to the end of the burst (expressed in s), the burst area as the area under the curve of the burst on the integrated signal (expressed in mV·s) (Figure 3).\nCalculate the frequency, amplitude, burst duration and burst area under normoxic (baseline), hypoxic (stimulus) and post-hypoxic (post-stimulus) recovery conditions as the average of the last 5 min of the recordings for each condition. Do not analyze the first portion of each condition because there is a delay between switching the perfusion and aCSF homogenization in the recording chamber.\nExpress then stimulus (i.e., hypoxia) and post-stimulus (i.e., post-hypoxic) recovery values as a percentage of the baseline values for the corresponding recording. Express the results as means ± S.D.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
