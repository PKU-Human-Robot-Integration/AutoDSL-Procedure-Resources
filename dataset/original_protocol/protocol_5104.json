    "Note: Ensure that all safety instructions for the handling of hazardous compounds and for waste management are properly considered; since these may vary in different countries the following protocol does not provide any instruction on these issues.Part I. Oxygen consumption assayIn solutions, the oxygen concentration can be monitored in real time and allows for the biochemical characterization of oxygenases. Here, we describe an assay to analyze the oxidative cleavage of rubber (polyisoprene) by rubber oxygenases such as rubber oxygenase RoxA or latex clearing protein (Lcp).PreparationsPrepare the oxygen monitoring instrument according to the instructions supplied by the respective manufacturer.(e.g., PreSensOxy-4-mini, https://www.presens.de/products/o2/meters.html[href=https://www.presens.de/products/o2/meters.html])The sensor spots are excited by light and therefore should be kept in a dark environment for long time storage when not in use, otherwise their reactivity and sensitivity will decrease.Cut the sensor spot in shape using sharp scissors. Don’t cut away too much to ensure a surface as big as possible but still fitting into the cuvette, here ~4 x 5 mm. Use long, slender tongs to reach into the cuvette.Pay attention on the orientation of the sensor spot, in case of PreSens spots, the red side comes in contact with the silicon compound and the glass wall of the cuvette whereas the black side represents the inside and comes in contact with the reaction mix later. Be careful not to put silicone compound on the black, reactive side of the sensor spot.Glue one sensor spot to the inner surface of each cuvette 5 mm above the bottom. Use the specified silicone compound as instructed by the manufacturer. For a video see: http://www.presens.de/support/presens-tv/how-to/o2-spot-integration-part1-glassvials.html[href=http://www.presens.de/support/presens-tv/how-to/o2-spot-integration-part1-glassvials.html]. Dry over night at room temperature in the dark. Prepare four cuvettes, compare Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315014250_6383.jpgFigure 1. Oxygen monitoring cuvettes. The total volume per cuvette is 1.4 ml.",
    "A PreSens oxygen sensor spot (red) was cut and glued in place as described above.To align the light cable with the sensor spots in the cuvettes, a self-made, modified cuvette rack is employed that is not commercially available. Instruction for assembly:Cut the 16 slot cuvette rack in the middle (to give two equal sized halves).Seal the bottoms of the four front slots with duct tape.Fill the cavity completely with hot glue, wait until the glue is solid.Cut away the bottoms of the four remaining slots (see Figure 2) so that the cuvettes fit in completely.Use a 3 mm power drill to drill a hole from the front of the cuvette rack to the back.Note: Be very careful not to bend the light conducting cable, otherwise it might break and become dysfunctional.Insert the light conducting cable so that the interface of the cable is correctly aligned with the sensor spot in the cuvette, compare Figure 2.Secure the light conducting cable against mechanical stress with a drop of hot glue to the cuvette rack.Repeat this procedure to prepare four slots.To finish the apparatus, glue the prepared block on the lid of a cryo storage box as a strain relief for the light conducting cable.Now your device should look comparable to the one pictured in Figure 2.Upon completion, position the device on a magnetic stirring unit and set it to ~750 rpm to mix the reagent solutions with a magnetic micro stirrer (5 x 2 mm) in each cuvette.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315014423_2412.jpgFigure 2.

The apparatus is placed on a magnetic stirring device to mix the reaction.",
    "This simple and cheap measuring station has been set up because, to our knowledge, no small scale measuring vessels are available; furthermore, in protein assays often only a very small amount of sample is available and our set up saves reagents and enzymes. Alternatively, one might employ a poly-carbonate block and mill the cavities into the block or to use a 3D-printer to assemble a cuvette holder. The assembly can easily be adjusted for another number of cuvettes. Other variants and sizes of cuvettes can be employed for the assay as well.Measurement of oxygen consumptionMeasurement of protein concentrationDetermine the protein concentration of the oxygenase to be characterized in this assay exactly by a suitable method, e.g., using the Bradford assay, the BCA assay, or, as in our case, spectroscopically via the known specific extinction coefficient of the heme containing rubber oxygenases. For example: spectroscopic determination of a LcpK30 protein concentration c E412 = ε412 x c x d or c = E412 x ε412-1 x d-1Where,ε412: extinction coefficient of LcpK30, 80,000 M-1 x cm-1 [L mol-1 cm-1] at 412 nmE412: absorbance measured spectroscopically at 412 nm [no unit]d: path length of the cuvette, usually 1 cmLcpK30 molecular weight ~43,300 Da = 43,300 g x mol-1Experimental data: measure the extinction of your protein of interest with a photometer in a cuvette with a path length of 1 cm in a suitable dilution; in the following example a value for the extinction at 412 nm of 0.5 was recorded for a 1:10 dilution of a purified LcpK30 solution.E412 = 0.5; dilution = 1:10, path length = 1 cm.Calculation:c = 0.5/80,000 x 1 [M x cm/cm] = [M]c = 0.5/80 [mM] = 500/80 [µM] = 6.25 µM1 M LcpK30 = 43,300 g/L 1 µM LcpK30 = 0.0433 g/L = 43.3 mg/L6.",
    "25 µM LcpK30 = 271.6 mg/L, since the protein was 1:10 diluted the concentration of the undiluted protein solution is 2716 mg/L or ~2.7 mg/mlWashing of latex milkStock latex milk containing approximately 60% polyisoprene latex is usually stabilized with ammonia that has to be removed by washing.Prepare 200 ml 0.1% wt/vol Nonidet P-40 by solving the detergent in deionized water.Pour 25 ml stock latex milk into a 50 ml Falcon tube and add 25 ml Nonidet solution.Invert the tube 10 times. Do not vortex or shake to prevent coagulation of the polymer.Centrifuge the tube at 11,000 x g at 4 °C for 1 h to separate the latex from the solution.Remove the white latex on top with a spatula into a new 50 ml tube.Discard the washing solution.Add Nonidet solution to the latex up to 50 ml.Resuspend the latex by inverting the tube several times.Repeat the washing procedure three times.After the last centrifugation step, weigh the remaining latex and dilute it to a concentration of 60% wt/vol with Nonidet solution.The washed natural rubber latex can be autoclaved (liquid cycle 121 °C for 20 min) in a heat-stable container and stored at ~5 °C for approximately 6 months.Preparation of diluted colloidal latex bufferFor use in the oxygen consumption assay, dilute the washed natural rubber latex to 0.2% wt/vol with air-saturated potassium phosphate buffer (KP, see Recipes) at the desired pH, usually pH 7.For example, pipette 6 ml KP buffer into a 15 ml Falcon tube and add 20 µl of the washed natural rubber latex in Nonidet solution, invert the tube 5 times.Incubate the buffer-diluted latex emulsion until the desired temperature (e.g., room temperature, 23 °C) is constantly reached; alternatively the whole system can be placed in a room with an elevated temperature, e.g., 30 °C).",
    "This is important since oxygen saturation depends on the temperature.Prearrangements for measuring oxygen saturation.Pipette 500 µl freshly prepared diluted colloidal latex buffer into each cuvette.Add a magnetic stirring rod to mix the emulsion at 750 rpm.Equilibrate for 2 min.Operation of the softwareStart the program for monitoring, in our case we use ‘oxy4v2’ for the measurement of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the cuvettes via the transmitter oxy4-mini.CalibrationSelect the tab labeled ‘Calibration’.Press the button labeled ‘All Channels’.Calibrate the diluted colloidal latex buffer to 100% saturation by pressing the button ‘CAL 100 %’. This corresponds to an oxygen concentration of ~8.3 mg per L at 23 °C. The slight difference in oxygen concentration between distilled water and the buffered assay emulsion used in this study is negligible. A second calibration with 0% oxygen is not necessary.Data loggingSelect the tab labeled ‘logging’.Press the button labeled ‘All Active Channels’.Pick a distinct file storage location and file name, e.g., ‘date_1Lcp_2Lcp_3blank_4blank_pH_temperature’.Press the button ‘save’.Setup for measurementsSelect the tab labeled ‘Measurement’.Pick a suitable sampling rate, e.g., 15 sec, equal for all cuvettes.Select 23 °C as the channel temperature when measuring at 23 °C room temperature.Choose ‘% air saturation’ as the oxygen unit.Press the button ‘All channels’ to start logging of acquired measurement data.Pay attention that the amplitude is in the green range, indicating that the light conducting cable and the sensor spot in the cuvette are properly aligned.Execution of the measurementSelect the tab labeled ‘All Channels’ to view the saturation graph for all channels.Measure the baseline for up to 10 min until linearity of the oxygen saturation has been reached. The value should be at ~100 ± 2% for all channels.Add the desired amount of enzyme to the assay mixture in each cuvette with a pipette or Hamilton syringe.",
    "Usually, a concentration of 4 µg/ml rubber oxygenase is sufficient to achieve a decrease of the oxygen concentration with a measurable slope in ~10 min.For example: enzyme in the assay/protein concentration x assay volume = amount: 4 µg/ml/0.25 µg/µl x 0.5 ml = 8 µl.Note: The decrease in oxygen concentration should be linear for at least 5 min. For routine assays, the cuvettes do not need to be sealed because oxygen consumption by the enzyme is much faster than diffusion of oxygen into the assay mixture.Stop the measurement by selecting the tab ‘Measurement’ and press the button ‘All Channels’. A representative dataset with a blank without enzyme (blue), wild type Lcp as reference (black) and two mutein samples (red and green) is pictured in Figure 3. Data was also shown in the supplementary materials of Röther et al., 2016.Termination and cleaning of the deviceCarefully remove each cuvette from the rack and pour the assay solution into a beaker to avoid loss of the magnetic stirrer. Wash the cuvette and stirrer with deionized water 3 times and dry the cuvettes in a dark environment.After prolonged measurements with diluted colloidal latex buffer, some precipitation of latex in the cuvettes might occur. The residual latex can be removed with a 2 mm spatula from the glass. Pay attention to the sensor spot to avoid damage. Do not use solvents to clean the inside of the cuvettes since they might dissolve the silicone compound securing the sensor spot in place. The spots can be reused as long as the amplitude is still indicated as sufficient by the software. If necessary, the sensor spot can be removed with a spatula and remains of the silicone compound can be removed with acetone.",
    "After drying the cuvette, a new sensor spot can be glued into the cuvette as described above.From the logged saturation data files, the slope of the decrease can be calculated using e.g., Excel as shown in the data analysis section. For data analysis and determination of specific enzyme activities, see below. Figure 3 shows a representative dataset for a measurement with four cuvettes. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170315/20170315015436_2973.jpg Figure 3. A representative dataset showing the monitoring of the oxygen saturation of diluted colloidal latex buffer. A blank without enzyme (blue) represents a baseline. After ≈ 4 min, wild type Lcp as reference (black) and two mutein samples (red and green) were added separately. The data are also shown in the supplementary materials of Röther et al., 2016.Inhibitor studies This assay allows for the rapid and easy determination of enzyme activities depending on the measurement of oxygen saturation. It is possible to compare different enzymes, muteins, or to investigate the effect of potential inhibitors. As an example, 0.1% SDS inhibits oxygen consumption by Lcp.Part II. HPLC based separation of rubber cleavage productsAfter the oxidative polyisoprene cleavage occurred, the produced oligo-isoprenoids can be extracted from the reaction mixture and subsequently separated by HPLC for analysis as described below.PreparationsSet up the HPLC apparatus according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer and install the RP-8 reversed phase column.Degas deionized water.Supply the water as first mobile phase and methanol as the second.Program a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min at 23 °C.Program the injection volume of 20 µl sample per run.Program the solvent gradient:table:",
