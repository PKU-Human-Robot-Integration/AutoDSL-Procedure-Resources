    "1. Preparation of Polyelectrolyte Solutions\nPurify chitosan, as detailed in Liao et al. Briefly, create a 1% (w/v) solution of chitosan in 2% (v/v) acetic acid and vacuum filter using grade 93 filter paper. Neutralize the filtrate using 5M NaOH until the pH stabilized to 7. Centrifuge the precipitated chitosan at 1,200 x g for 10 min. Decant the supernatant and add deionized water to wash the chitosan. Repeat the centrifugation and washing step two more times. Freeze the precipitated chitosan at -80 °C and lyophilize O/N to obtain the purified form. Store purified chitosan in a dehumidified cabinet.\nWeigh out 1 g of purified chitosan into a sterile tissue culture dish. Place the chitosan in the tissue culture dish as close as possible to the UV lamp in the biological safety cabinet and expose to UV light for 15 min. Using sterile forceps, place the sterilized chitosan into a glass container. Dissolve chitosan using filtered 0.15M acetic acid to a final concentration between 0.5% and 1% (w/v).\nWeigh out 0.1 g of alginic acid sodium salt and dissolve in 10 ml distilled deionized (DDI) water to obtain a 1% (w/v) solution. Mix the alginic acid sodium salt for at least 2 hr on the vortex mixer to ensure complete dissolution. Filter the alginate solution through 0.2 µm syringe filter. Store the alginate solution at 4 °C.\nReconstitute human recombinant growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or beta - nerve growth factor (NGF), as recommended by manufacturer.\n2. Drawing of IPC Fibers",
    "Mix proteins, growth factors or other biomolecules into 10-20 µl aliquot of the polyelectrolyte solution that has a similar net charge. Biological molecules with net negative charge (eg bovine serum albumin [BSA]) should be mixed with alginate solution. Biological molecules with net positive charge (eg VEGF) should be mixed with chitosan solution.\nPlace small aliquots (10-20 µl) of chitosan and alginate on a stable flat surface that is covered with parafilm. The droplets of chitosan and alginate should be placed in close proximity but not in contact with each other.\nLightly dip each tip on a pair of forceps into the chitosan and alginate droplets. Bring the droplets of polyelectrolytes together by pinching the forceps. When the droplets come into contact with each other, slowly pull the forceps vertically upward to draw the IPC fiber from the interface of the two droplets (Figure 1A).\nCarefully place the end of the drawn IPC fiber on the forceps on a collector, such as a flat polymeric scaffold affixed on a rotating mandrel (see section 3 and 4). Rotate the mandrel at a fixed speed of 10 mm/sec to allow formation of uniform and beadless IPC fibers. Increasing the speed of drawing the IPC fibers will form beads, which will cause a burst release of incorporated biochemical and premature fiber termination.10\nTo determine incorporation efficiency, collect all the remaining liquids left on the parafilm by diluting with 500 µl of 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Measure the protein or growth factor content in the residue through BCA assay (for BSA), ELISA (for VEGF and NGF) or an appropriate assay to detect incorporated biomolecule.\n3. Fabrication of Composite Hydrogel Scaffold of Pullulan-Dextran (PD) Polysaccharide and IPC Fibers\nFabricating sacrificial pullulan frame for IPC fiber collection",
    "Weigh out pullulan polysaccharide and mix with distilled deionized (DDI) water to create a 20% (w/v) aqueous solution. Mix the pullulan solution O/N to ensure homogeneity.\nCast 15 g of pullulan solution into a 10 cm diameter tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) dish. Dry the pullulan solution O/N at 37 °C. Cut the pullulan films into 7 mm x 7 mm square frames.\nPreparing pullulan-dextran polysaccharide solution\n\t\nCreate a 30% (w/v) solution of the polysaccharides pullulan and dextran (3:1 ratio) in DDI water. Mix O/N to ensure homogeneity of the polysaccharide solution. Slowly add in sodium bicarbonate to the polysaccharide solution to achieve a final concentration of 20% (w/v). Mix O/N to ensure homogeneity of the solution. Store the polysaccharide solution at 4 °C.\nCollecting IPC fibers on pullulan frame\n\t\nAffix the sacrificial pullulan frame (section 3.1) using an alligator clip. Stick the alligator clip and pullulan frame on the end of the rotating mandrel using plastic-coated adhesive tape. Rotate the mandrel with the affixed frame at a constant speed of 10 mm/sec. The pullulan frame can be affixed onto the rotating mandrel in desired orientations.\nDraw the IPC fibers using a pair of forceps (section 1) and attach the drawn end of the IPC fibers onto the rotating pullulan frame. Draw the IPC fibers at a constant speed. Upon reaching the terminal end of the IPC fiber, dry the fibers-on-frame construct O/N at RT.\nEmbedding IPC fibers into PD hydrogel scaffold",
    "To crosslink every gram of pullulan-dextran solution, add 100 µl of 11% (w/v) sodium trimetaphosphate aqueous solution and 100 µl 10M sodium hydroxide.7 Mix the solution at 60 rpm using a stirplate for 1 to 2 min. After the addition of sodium trimetaphosphate and sodium hydroxide, the polysaccharide solution will crosslink almost immediately. Pour the viscous polysaccharide solution onto the fibers-on-frame construct to fully embed the IPC fibers. Incubate the combined pullulan-dextran-IPC fibers (PD-IPC) at 60 °C for 30 min to form a chemically crosslinked composite scaffolds (Figure 1B).\nCAUTION: Perform step 3.3.2 in the fume hood and use proper protective equipment as acetic acid is a corrosive and flammable.\nTo induce pore formation in the PD-IPC scaffold, submerge the whole scaffold in 20% (w/v) acetic acid for 20 min.\nRemove unreacted reagents by washing PD-IPC scaffolds in 1X PBS for 5 min while shaking at 100 rpm. Repeat this step 2 times.\nRemove the excess PBS and immediately freeze the PD-IPC scaffolds at -80 °C O/N. Lyophilize the scaffolds at least 24 hr before use in any controlled release or bioactivity assays.\n4. Fabrication of Composite Scaffold of PCL and IPC Fibers\nCAUTION: Dichloromethane is a hazardous material. Use the fume hood and personal protective equipment when handling dichloromethane. \nCreating pristine and patterned PDMS substrates\n\t\nCreate a pristine polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomeric substrate using a piece of TCPS of desired dimension using soft lithography process. Create patterned PDMS substrates by using standard soft lithographic methods on poly(methyl methacrylate) templates with the desired topography.12\nFabricating sacrificial PCL frame for IPC fiber collection",
    "Weigh out PCL and dissolve in dichloromethane to create a 0.9% (w/v) solution. For every 1 cm2 area of the PDMS substrate, drop 500 µl of 0.9% PCL solution. Allow all of the dichloromethane solvent to fully evaporate in the fume hood. Repeat the process of casting 0.9% PCL to thicken the film to the desired thickness. Remove the dried PCL film from the PDMS substrate. Create a hole in the PCL frame using a suitably-sized puncher.2\nCollecting IPC fibers on the PCL frame\n\t\nAffix the sacrificial PCL frame with hole (from 4.2.1) on an alligator clip. Stick the alligator clip onto the rotating mandrel by using plastic-coated adhesive tape. Attach the drawn end of the IPC fiber onto the PCL frame before starting the rotation at a constant speed of 10mm/sec (section 2). After the end of IPC fiber drawing, dry the fiber-on-frame construct O/N at 4 °C.\nEmbedding fiber-on-frame construct into patterned PCL substrate\n\t\nDrop 500 µl of 0.9% PCL solution onto the PDMS substrate to create a pristine or patterned PCL base, as required. Cast multiple layers of 0.9% PCL solution to obtain a scaffold with the desired thickness. Allow all of the dichloromethane solvent to fully evaporate in the fume hood.\nPlace the fiber-on-frame construct (section 4.3.1) on top of the PCL base. Add 0.9% PCL solution on the fiber-on-frame construct multiple times to get the desired thickness and fully embed the IPC fibers, fabricating a PCL-IPC composite scaffold (Figure 1C).\n5. Measurement of Release of Biological Agents from Composite IPC Scaffolds\nPlace composite PD-IPC or PCL-IPC scaffolds and stand-alone IPC fibers separately in a 24-well plate.",
    "Immerse the scaffold and stand-alone IPC fibers with 500 µl of 1X PBS. Incubate the samples at 37 °C. Collect PBS at various time points (release media) and replace with 500 µl of 1X PBS.\nMeasure the amount of protein or growth factor in the release media using a BCA assay (BSA), ELISA (VEGF and NGF) or other appropriate assay to calculate the cumulative release profile for the incorporated biomolecule.\n6. Seeding of Cells on Composite IPC Scaffolds to Test Bioactivity of Released Biological Agents\nSterilize the lyophilized PD-IPC or PCL-IPC composite scaffolds using UV light in the biological safety cabinet for at least 20 min.\nUse standard cell culture techniques to obtain a cell suspension of 2 x 105 cells in 200 µl growth media. Seed the concentrated cell suspension onto the composite scaffolds. After 20 min, top-up the volume of growth media to fully submerge the scaffolds.\nMeasure cell activity through standard techniques such as Alamar blue metabolic activity assay, PC12 neurite outgrowth assay or immunofluorescence.\nSubscription Required.
