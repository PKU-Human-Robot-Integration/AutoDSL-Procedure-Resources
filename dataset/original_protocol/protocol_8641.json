    "The use of rats for research was in accordance with guidelines established by the Animal Welfare Committee of The University of Tokyo.\n1.Preparation of Plasmid DNA\nGenerate DNA plasmids for in vivo electroporation by subcloning the cDNA or shRNA sequence into an expression plasmid for mammalian cells12. Use a cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer and chicken β-actin promoter fusion (CAG) promoter-driven plasmid13 because it allows strong and stable expression. For expression of shRNAs under the control of a CAG promoter, use a mir30-based shRNA cassette system for subcloning the shRNA14.\nPurify plasmid DNA with a maxi-prep kit according to manufacturer's instructions, and resuspend the DNA with HEPES-buffered saline (140 mM NaCl, 0.75 mM Na2HPO4, 25 mM HEPES; pH 7.40). Adjust the concentration of DNA to ≥4 µg/µl.\nPrepare the plasmid DNA solution to a concentration of 4 µg/µl, and add a minimal amount of fast green dye (final concentration of 0.01%) to label the injection site. When simultaneous electroporation of multiple plasmids is required, adjust the total concentration of the plasmid DNA solution to 4 µg/µl.\n\tNote: The optimal composition of plasmid DNAs should be determined according to the transfection efficiency of each plasmid.\n2. Sterilization of Surgical Instruments and Saline\nAutoclave surgical instruments and the 0.9% NaCl solution.\n3. Preparation of the Glass Micropipette\nPull glass pipettes using a pipette puller. Cut the tip of the pipette to a diameter of 30-50 µm. Use the following parameters: Heat, 600; Velocity, 50; Time, 75.\n4. Animal Surgery, DNA Injection and Electroporation\nNote: An overview of this step is described in Figure 1. Although the procedure for rat pups are described here, the method is also applicable to more mature animals using the same procedure.",
    "Anesthetize the rat with isoflurane in the induction box until the animal becomes immobile by adjusting the oxygen flow to 0.4 L/min and the isoflurane concentration to 4% (vol/vol). Perform toe pinching to confirm proper anesthetization.\nPut the rat on the preheated warmer under a binocular microscope, and maintain anesthesia by continuously administering isoflurane through the face mask. Adjust the oxygen flow to 0.2 L/min and the isoflurane concentration to 2% (vol/vol). Use eye drops to prevent dryness of eyes if the eyes of the animal are open.\nFix the legs with surgical tape.\nClean the skin on the posterior thigh with povidone-iodine, and make an incision with a scalpel.\n\tNote: Shave surgical areas if the surgical areas are covered with hair.\nExpose the sciatic nerve by creating an opening between the quadriceps femoris muscle and biceps femoris muscle with sewing needles.\nWet the nerve with 0.9% NaCl solution. Absorb excess water with lint-free paper.\nInsert the base of a glass micropipette onto flexible tubing, and fill the adequate amount of DNA solution (at least one microliter) into the micropipette by gently aspirating.\nLift the exposed nerve by gently pulling the distal side of the nerve using a needle.\n\tNote: Do not apply tension to the nerve to minimize mechanical stress.\nInsert the glass micropipette into the distal site on the nerve, and inject the DNA solution by applying pressure (i.e. by blowing into the open end of the flexible tube). Inject DNA solution until the nerve appears green (1 µl maximum). Because frequent insertion of the micropipette can damage the nerve, do not insert the micropipette more than twice.\nPlace a tweezer-type platinum electrode about 1-2 mm apart from the nerve. Fill the gap between the electrode and the nerve with 0.9% NaCl solution.",
    "Note: Do not hold the nerve with the electrode to avoid mechanical stress on the nerve.\nApply electric pulses to the injection site using an electroporator with the electrode. After the first pulse set, invert the electrode and apply another pulse set. Use the following parameters: voltage, 50 V; pulse duration, 5 msec; pulse interval, 100 msec; pulse number, 4 times.\nClean the electroporation site with 0.9% NaCl solution.\nRepeat steps 4.4-4.11 on the contralateral sciatic nerve.\n5. Post-electroporation\nClose the incisions with cyanoacrylate glue.\nAfter drying the glue, clean the wound with povidone-iodine.\nRelease the pup from the face mask. Warm the pup on a warmer at least for an hour in order to allow it to fully recover from anesthesia. Do not leave the pup unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness.\nAfter recovery from anesthesia, return the pup to the mother rat. Do not return the pup until fully recovered.\n6. Post-surgery\nHouse the rat pups in the cage until conducting the experiments11 (see examples in Figure 3). Administer carprofen (5 mg/kg; i.p.), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), an opioid analgesic, if required.\n\tNote: If the rat pup does not grow well or inflammation is observed around the surgery site, exclude the animal from the experiments."
