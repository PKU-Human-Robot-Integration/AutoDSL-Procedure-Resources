    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nVascular lung perfusion and pneumonectomy\nTiming: 20 min per lung (plus 10 min for each additional experimental animal) (for step 1)\nThis step details handling of experimental animals and lung excision with or without prior perfusion (optional). Animals are sacrificed either by bleeding out via heat puncture (after step 1) or by bleeding out through transection of the abdominal vena cava (step 5).\nSubject laboratory animals to deep anesthesia according to approved protocols e.g., with 3-fold overdosed anesthetics. Confirm depth of anesthesia by loss of pedal withdrawal reflex.\nNote: If working under BSL-3 conditions, make sure to wear appropriate PPE including chain gloves when handling animals while they are still awake and to use appropriate safety needles and sharps.\nNote: If protocol without perfusion is performed animals can be sacrificed at this step by bleeding out via heart puncture. If analysis of blood or serum is to be performed in parallel, it can be collected here and placed in an EDTA or clotting tube, respectively. EDTA blood should be kept on ice, whilst clotting should be allowed to occur at 20°C.\nNote: Protocols with and without perfusion generated valid results. Past reasons to follow a protocol without perfusion were in our case e.g., i) necessity to increase speed of experimental procedures, ii) regulatory limitations restricting use of sharps in biosafety level 3 laboratory and iii) approved animal experimental protocols for sacrifice by bleeding out via heart puncture instead of vena cava.\nPlace anesthetized animals in a secured supine position.\nSoak abdominal and thoracic areas with 70% ethanol to disinfect the fur and keep the surgical instruments sterile.\nCritical: Ensure that the laboratory animal does not aspirate ethanol as it could potentially damage cells in upper and lower airways.",
    "Open the abdominal cavity by incising the abdominal skin and peritoneum from the sternum to the pubis using surgical scissors and forceps.\nSacrifice the animal by bleeding out through transection of the abdominal vena cava (in case bleeding out via heart puncture has not been performed after step 1).\nNote: If analysis of blood or serum is to be performed in parallel, it can be collected here from the abdominal vena cava in a 1 mL syringe using a 27G needle and placed in an EDTA or clotting tube, respectively. EDTA blood should be kept on ice, whilst clotting should be allowed to occur at 20°C.\nOpen the thoracic cavity and expose the heart and lungs.\nWithout perfusion continue with step 9, with perfusion proceed with step 8.\nPerfuse the pulmonary vessels through the animals’ right heart ventricle by slowly flushing with 5 mL lung perfusion medium using a 5 mL syringe capped with a 26G needle (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2294-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Lung perfusion and pneumonectomy\n(A) Illustration displaying perfusion of pulmonary vessels through the right heart ventricle.\n(B) Medial thoracotomy was performed to enable access to the heart.\n(C and D) (C) The heart is fixed in position with tweezers to inject perfusion needle and (D) ejection of lung perfusion media.\n(E) Illustration displaying prepared trachea and perfused lungs.\n(F) Heart and thymus are removed facilitating access to the lungs.\n(G) Pneumonectomy is performed without tissue contact by lifting the trachea.\n(H) Once transferred to cell culture dish, remaining parts of the trachea are removed and dissected lungs (without trachea) are stored in digestion media.\nNote: The perfusion step allows for removal of blood cells within the pulmonary vessels.",
    "Lift up the lungs by pulling the trachea, dissect them free and dip them twice into ice-cold PBS to remove residual fluid or blood.\nRemove the trachea.\nPlace the lungs (mice) or right caudal lobe (hamsters) in an individual well of a 6-well plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H) or in an individual petri dish and add 2 mL lung digestion medium.\nNote: If dissecting multiple animals one after another, place lungs into 3 mL RPMI medium or PBS containing 1% BSA and 2 μg/mL actinomycin D on ice until all animals are dissected, then proceed with step 11.\nEnzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation of lung tissue\nTiming: 50 min per lung (plus 10 min for each additional lung)\nThis step details how enzymatic digestion in combination with gentle mechanical force allows for dissociation of solid lung tissue into single cell suspension.\nNote: For processing multiple lungs, the following steps are carried out in parallel for each well. Clean forceps with 1× PBS before moving on to the next well.\nCritical: Rapid, yet gentle cell isolation reduces cell stress and ensures high quality transcriptome data.\nWithin the digestion medium, mechanically dissociate the tissue by securing it with straight anatomical forceps in one hand and repeatedly hitting it with a second curved anatomical set of forceps held in the other hand for approximately 2–3 min. Alternatively, lungs can be cut into <1 mm pieces using pointed scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2294-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mincing of murine lung tissue in digestion medium\n(A) Mechanical dissociation of lung tissue by repeatedly clapping with forceps.\n(B) Result when of lung tissue was minced using pointed scissors.\nNote: We have experienced that dissociating lung tissue with clapping forceps results in higher numbers of structural lung cells.",
    "Incubate at 37°C (with occasional shaking, e.g., using an orbital shaker at 0.26 × g) for 30 min.\nAdd 8 mL ice-cold 1% BSA/PBS buffer to stop enzymatic digestion.\nPipette the tissue and liquid up and down 3–10 times using a 5 mL serological pipette to further disrupt the lung tissue. Avoid introducing air bubbles.\nCollect the complete suspension in a 10 mL serological pipette and discharge onto a 70 μm cell strainer placed on top of a 50 mL conical tube.\nUse the plunger of a 5 mL syringe to gently swipe remaining lung tissue through the cell strainer.\nRinse the well with 10 mL cold 1% BSA/PBS or 0.5% BSA/PBS buffer and pass it through the cell strainer to retrieve the maximal number of cells.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nRed blood cell lysis, cell filtration and counting\nTiming: 35 min per lung (plus 20 min for each additional lung) (for step 20)\nThis step details red blood cell lysis, and washing and counting of lung cells.\nAdd RBC lysis buffer (2–10 mL) to the cell pellet and carefully resuspend. Incubate the suspension for 2–5 min at 20°C.\nNote: The required volume and incubation time is dependent on the rodent species and prior vascular perfusion of lungs. We recommend testing appropriate volume and incubation times for individual experimental settings. In our hands, 2 mL RBC lysis buffer and 2 min incubation time was sufficient for perfused mouse lungs while 10 mL RBC lysis buffer and 5 min incubation time was sufficient for non-perfused hamster lungs.\nStop RBC lysis by adding at least 10 mL 0.04% BSA/PBS buffer.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 6 min at 4°C and discard supernatant.",
    "To ensure that RBC are lysed, check if pellet has turned colorless (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). If not repeat steps 18–21.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2294-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cell pellets prior and after red blood cell lysis\n(A and B) (A) Cell pellet containing RBC (as indicated by the red color) prior to adding RBC lysis buffer (left) and (B) after successful RBC lysis (right).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 4–10 mL of 0.04% BSA/PBS buffer.\nFilter the single cell suspension by discharge onto a 40 μm cell strainer placed on top of a 15 mL conical tube.\nDetermine the cell concentration by counting cells using a Neubauer hemocytometer:\nDilute the single cell suspension 1:10 in trypan blue solution by adding 20 μL cell suspension to 180 μL trypan blue solution and gently pipette to allow mixing.\nCount cells in the 4 square subdivisions placed at the corners of a Neubauer hemocytometer (S1 – S4).\nCalculate the cell concentration for each sample.\n   c e l l  c o u n t =   S 1 + S 2 + S 3 + S 4  4   x  d i l u t i o n  f a c t o r  x  10  000  x  s a m p l e  v o l u m e   [  m L  ]   \nVisually check cell viability and singularity on the hemocytometer.\nNote: Viability should be at least 80%. A high proportion of dead cells indicates problematic handling of tissue, e.g., due to enzyme concentrations, incubation time and other processing steps being too harsh. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nNote: To increase the fraction of viable cells in the single cell suspension, depletion of dead cells using magnetic cell separation or fluorescence-activated cell sorting can be performed.",
    "Adjust the single cell suspension to approximately 500 μL to 1 mL suspension with an appropriate concentration for single-cell RNA-sequencing by diluting with 0.04% BSA/PBS buffer.\nFilter 500 μL to 1 mL of the diluted suspension with Flowmi® cell strainers (40 μm) to ultimately remove cell clumps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2294-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Removal of cell clumps\nCell filtering via Flowmi.\nNote: The optimal cell density for the demonstrated single-cell sequencing approach using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Kit v3.1 (10x Genomics) was 4 × 105 – 2 × 106 cells/mL. Low concentrations of BSA in buffers are recommended for mRNA barcoding steps by the manufacturer.\nNote: Labeling or barcoding of mRNA needs to be performed as soon as possible after processing of the final single cell suspension. Please refer to the desired manufacturer’s protocol for step-by-step instructions.\nIn the demonstrated approach that generated the data shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Kit v3.1 (10x Genomics) was used for mRNA barcoding, reverse transcription, and single-cell transcriptome library preparation (https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/1eX2FPdpeCgnCJtw4fj9Hx/7cb84edaa9eca04b607f9193162994de/CG000204_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3_v3.1_Rev_D.pdf[href=https://assets.ctfassets.net/an68im79xiti/1eX2FPdpeCgnCJtw4fj9Hx/7cb84edaa9eca04b607f9193162994de/CG000204_ChromiumNextGEMSingleCell3_v3.1_Rev_D.pdf]). Next generation sequencing was performed using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 (150 Cycles) on a NextSeq500 device (both Illumina).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2294-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) plots represent size and granularity of cells, respectively. R0: represents counting beads, R1 represents all cells minus debris. Cells gated on R1 are displayed for CD45, CD326 and CD31 positive populations to identify leukocytes (R2), epithelial cells (R3) and endothelial cells (R4), respectively. FVD was used to stain dead cells (R5) and to allow discrimination of viable leukocytes, epithelial and endothelial cells (R6 to R8) from dead cells.\n(B and C) (B) UMAP plot displaying clustering and annotation of sequenced and bioinformatically evaluated naive murine lung cells and (C) pie chart indicating proportions of sequenced and annotated lung cell types.

    "The aim of this protocol is to provide an easy-to-handle lung cell isolation and processing workflow that has been performed under high containment biological laboratories and is thus suitable for infectious disease research. Processing naïve lung tissue according to steps 1 to 29 should provide a single cell suspension containing approximately 1 × 107 cells (murine C57BL/6J lungs and Syrian hamsters’ caudal lung lobe). Cell numbers can vary, depending on age, disease, infectious agent and time point of analysis. Cell suspensions should include alveolar, interstitial, and inflammatory macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, alveolar epithelial cells type 1 and type 2, ciliated cells, endothelial cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, mesothelial cells, natural killer cells, T cells and B cells with singularity and viability rates of above 90%, thereby fulfilling the necessary technical quality criteria for subsequent single-cell RNA-sequencing. The expected unsorted (not enriched or depleted for any specific cell type) physiological frequencies of pulmonary cell types after barcoding, library preparation and sequencing are displayed in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nGenerated sequencing data can be processed in a straightforward way using the demonstrated Vignette of R Package Seurat. 13[href=https://star-protocols.cell.com/bib13], 14[href=https://star-protocols.cell.com/bib14], 15[href=https://star-protocols.cell.com/bib15] The adapted code for generating a murine lung Seurat Object from a single sequencing file is displayed in Code Boxes 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbox1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbox2].

If a particular population of cells is of specific interest, we highly recommend carefully practicing the protocol and analyzing the samples via flow cytometry prior to proceeding with single-cell barcoding experiments. For instance, staining for major cell populations of the lung (e.g., CD45+  leukocytes, CD326+ epithelial cells and CD31+ endothelial cells) and for cell viability (via measuring 7AAD- or FVD-  cells) can be performed, which allows the frequencies of viable singlets amongst the parent population (or total numbers of cells) to be determined.\nBioanalyzer and Qubit",
    "Before sequencing the final single-cell gene expression libraries, quality control measures should be performed to determine the concentration (Qubit) and cDNA fragment sizes (Bioanalyzer) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2294-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Quality control of generated gene expression libraries\nExample of a final gene expression library with fragment size distribution suitable for next generation sequencing.\nNote: Instead of using a Bioanalyzer, the fragment sizes can also be measured using a fragment analyzer or tape station.\nLimitations\nAlthough the demonstrated protocol was established to represent all major lung cell types, we observe that the distribution of isolated cell types might not necessarily represent cellular frequencies of physiological lung tissue. Estimates based on morphological identification and counting of cells in normal lung tissue sections across species suggest that alveolar type 1 epithelial cells represent between 8%–12%, alveolar type 2 epithelial cells 8%–16%, endothelial cells 30%–46% and alveolar macrophages 3%–10% of total lung cells.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Over- or underrepresentation of cell types of interest depend on the type and amount of enzymes used during digestion and processing of the tissue."
