  "procedures": [
    "The present protocol follows the ethics guidelines of Amsterdam UMC. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for this article and the video.\n1. Preoperative management\nPerform preoperative imaging with a CT scan to assess the localization and the extent of the duodenal stenosis and its relationship with the papilla of Vater (Figure 1).\nPerform esophagogastroduodenoscopy to describe the stenosis and its location. The duodenal lumen must be partially/entirely obstructed by the lesion, making it impossible for the endoscope to proceed any further and complete curative endoscopic treatment (Figure 2). Place, before the stenosis, a small 1 cm mark with an inked tattoo on the submucosa for intraoperative identification of the lesion.\nEvaluate the eligibility for the surgical approach and relative contraindications (severe stenosis causing dysphagia, pain, malnutrition, feasibility of treating the disease endoscopically, duodenal stenosis far and distal from the papilla of Vater, no history of abdominal surgery, and in more general terms any benign, premalignant, malignant local entity in D3 duodenum which can be treated with a partial duodenectomy).\n2. Anesthesia, positioning of the patient, and safety check procedures\nInduce the patient with general anesthesia with the help of an anesthesiologist.\nPlace the patient in a French position. Lower the right arm alongside the patient on an arm board while placing the left arm in a 90° position. Tilt the table 20° to the left of the patient and in a 20° reverse Trendelenburg position.\nPerform the safety check procedures as required by the Institution (e.g., patient's name and surname, date of birth, type of surgery, prophylactic antibiotic therapy, etc.) and create a sterile area using chloride surgical solution and surgical drapes.\n3. Pneumoperitoneum creation and trocars' placement",
    "Insert a Veress needle at Palmer's point, 2 cm below the left coastal margin following the mid-clavicular line, in order to create a pneumoperitoneum. Then insufflate to 10-12 mm CO2.\nAfter insufflation, mark the positions of the trocars and place them as shown in Figure 3 (4 robot trocars, 2 (12 mm) laparoscopic table-side surgeon trocars).\n\t\nFirst, draw a line from a point, 2 cm to the right of the umbilicus to the costal margin left of the gallbladder. On this line, 11-12 cm downwards from the costal margin, mark the robotic camera trocar, number 3.\nAt 7 cm distance left and right from trocar 3, mark trocars 2 and 4.\nMark trocar 1, 7 cm craniolateral from trocar 2.\n\t\t​NOTE: This follows the Pittsburgh approach for robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy4,5,6. However, this procedure can also be performed with only one laparoscopic trocar, which can later be used for the extraction of the specimen.\n4. Port placement\nInsufflate with a Verres needle at the Palmers' point connected to the CO2 resource. Place a 12 mm table-side surgeon trocar, 7 cm from both robot trocars 2 and 3, to the right of the umbilicus.\nPlace the four 8 mm robotic trocars as marked after inspection and removal of the Veress needle.\nPlace a second 12 mm table-side surgeon trocar, 7 cm from both trocars 3 and 4.\n\t​NOTE: Make sure the distance between all the trocars is approximately 7 cm.\n5. Docking\nInstall the robot over the patient's right shoulder and dock the robot arms to the robotic trocars.",
    "​NOTE: The final operative setting is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. To facilitate a large standalone 3D screen to the patient's right, have the robot come in cranially, over the patient's shoulder. To facilitate a comfortable position for the table-side surgeon, ensure that this surgeon sits down with cranially placed trocars and a favorable screen position.\n6. Treitz mobilization\nCranialize the greater omentum and colon by pushing them aside towards the diaphragm.\nIdentify the first jejunal loop from the retroperitoneal cavity through the Treitz ligament.\nDissect the left side of the ligament of Treitz to free the most distal part of the duodenum and the first part of the jejunum from the aorta using the robotic cautery hook on arm 4 and the laparoscopic vessel sealer.\n7. Ascending colon and hepatic flexure mobilization\nPerform tunneling through the hepatocolic ligament in order to spare vascular structures.\nPerform mobilization of the hepatic flexure and the ascending colon using the robotic cautery hook on arm 4 and the laparoscopic sealing device.\n\t​NOTE: Pay attention to any vascular abnormalities of the right colonic artery.\n8. Pancreatic head identification and mobilization\nPerform the Kocher maneuver by mobilizing the duodenum and the head of the pancreas from the caudal to cranial using the robotic cautery hook and the laparoscopic sealing device. To do so, incise the peritoneum at the right edge of the duodenum and move the duodenum and the head of the pancreas to the left of the patient7.\nPerform the traction of the jejunal loop in the retroperitoneal cavity.\n9. Duodenal resection\nStaple the intestinal loop, 10 cm distally, to the submucosal tattoo.\nDetach the duodenum from its mesentery using a laparoscopic sealing device, by performing a safe and feasible dissection of the mesentery.",
    "Staple the duodenum at the level of the submucosal tattoo, including the tattoo in the specimen. A robotic endo stapler can be used as well.\n\t​NOTE: The minimum distance of the lesion from the papilla of Vater should be 5 cm. In other situations (e.g., 2-5 cm), a Fogarty balloon-tipped catheter can be passed through the papilla of Vater. This can be confirmed intraoperatively by endoscopy.\n10. Duodeno-jejunostomy\nCreate two small enterotomies using robotic scissors with diathermia at the antimesenteric side of the duodenal and jejunal stump.\nMake a side-to-side jejuno-jejunostomy of 60 mm using an endo-stapler with a vascular cartridge (white cartridge).\nClose the remaining anastomosis opening with two layers of running 4-0 suture (~15 cm).\n11. Drain-placement\nIn case of a misfire of the stapler or in case of accidental contamination of the abdomen from intestinal fluids, place a drain.\n\t​NOTE: Drain was not placed in this specific case. The patient underwent elective operation with no operative events, so no drain was needed.\n12. Postoperative management\nRemove the nasogastric tube early in the morning of postoperative day 1. Start a soft liquid diet and move on to a normal diet in 24 h.\nAssess serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and leucocyte levels on postoperative days 2, 3, and 4. Perform a CT or MRI scan of the abdomen if CRP on day four is elevated compared to day three or when there are undesired changes in the postoperative course (drain quality, insufficient clinical improvement).\nDischarge the patient earlier if clinically well, eating sufficiently, pain-free, and CRP <150.\n\t​NOTE: The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3, almost pain-free, clinically well, with a CRP value of 67 mg/L.\n13. Post-discharge management\nPerform follow-up medical examination after 10-14 days."
