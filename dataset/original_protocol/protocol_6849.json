    "Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolationIsolate PBMCs from samples acquired in heparinized tubes from healthy volunteers. PBMCs are isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque solution.Dilute the blood sample 1:2 with the same volume of RPMI 1640.Add a volume of Ficoll-Hypaque solution equal to that of the blood sample in a 50-ml centrifuge tube.Add the diluted blood sample carefully and slowly to the surface of the separation fluid. Centrifuge at 800 × g for 20-30 min at room temperature.Note: The blood sample volume determines the centrifugal conditions; read the separation solution instructions. Carefully absorb the second annular opalescent lymphocyte layer into another centrifuge tube, add 10-20 ml RPMI 1640, mix well, and centrifuge the cell suspension at 580 × g for 10 min at room temperature.Aspirate the supernatant completely. Wash the cell pellet by adding 10 ml RPMI 1640 and centrifuging at 290 × g for 10 min at room temperature.Repeat Step A5.MACS separationCD8+ cells (A-CD8+) and CD4+ cells (A-CD4+) are isolated from PBMCs of individual A by positive selection using the MACS system. APCs are obtained by depletion of CD2+ cells from PBMCs of individual B (B-APCs) or individual I (I-APCs). Donors were selected according to their HLA-A, -B, and -DR compatibility or incompatibility based on the specific requirements of individual experiments. Several groups of individuals designated as A, B, and I, which are fully HLA-A, -B, and -DR mismatched were screened out from 130 volunteers and used for independent experiments.Note: Keep the cells and the buffer cold. Centrifuge at 4°C. Add 10 ml 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer to resuspend PBMCs (from Step A6) and determine the cell number.Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 10 min. Aspirate the supernatant completely.Resuspend the cell pellet in 80 μl 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer per 107 cells.",
    "Add 20 μl appropriate Microbeads per 107 cells.Mix well and incubate for 20 min in the refrigerator (2-8°C).Wash the cells by adding 1-2 ml 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer per 107 cells and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min. Aspirate the supernatant completely.Resuspend up to 108 cells in 500 μl 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer.Note: For higher cell numbers, scale up the buffer volume accordingly. Place the LS column in the magnetic field of a MidiMACS separator.Note: Choose an appropriate MACS column and MACS separator according to the numbers of total and positive cells. For details, see the Microbead instructions. Prepare the column by rinsing with 3 ml 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer.Apply the cell suspension to the LS column.Collect the unlabeled cells that pass through and wash the column with 3 ml 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer. Collect the total effluent; this is the unlabeled cell fraction (such as CD2- cells).Wash the column by adding 3 ml 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer twice. Only add fresh 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer when the column reservoir is empty.Remove the column from the separator and place on a suitable collection tube.Pipette 5 ml buffer onto the column. Immediately flush out the magnetically labeled cells by firmly pushing the plunger into the column (such as CD8+ cells, CD4+ cells).Perform flow cytometry analysis to evaluate the purity of the sorted cell suspensions; the purity should be ≥97%.In vitro expansion of CD8+CD28− T cellsA-CD8+ cells are isolated by positive selection using the MACS system according to Procedure B. B-APCs (CD2- cells) from HLA-A, -B, -DR mismatched individual B are isolated by depletion of CD2+ cells using CD2 microbeads.Centrifuge the A-CD8+ cells and B-APCs obtained above at 300 × g for 10 min. Aspirate the supernatant completely.Resuspend in 5 ml RPMI1640 and determine the cell number.",

Aspirate the supernatant completely.Resuspend up to 108 cells in 500 μl 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer.Note: For higher cell numbers, scale up the buffer volume accordingly.",
    "Place the LS column in the magnetic field of a MidiMACS separator.Note: Choose an appropriate MACS column and MACS separator according to the numbers of total and positive cells. For details, see the microbead instructions. Prepare the column by rinsing with 3 ml 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer.Apply the cell suspension to the column.Collect the unlabeled cells that pass through and wash the column with 3 ml 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer. Collect the total effluent; this is the unlabeled cell fraction (CD28- cells).Perform flow cytometry analysis to evaluate the purity of CD28- cell suspensions; the purity should be ≥95%.In vitro suppression assaysResponder CD4+ cells are isolated from PBMCs of individual A (A-CD4+ T cells) by positive selection using CD4 microbeads. As stimulators, APCs cells from individual B (B-APCs) or from HLA-A, -B, -DR fully mismatched indifferent individual I (I-APCs) are isolated by depletion of CD2+ cells using CD2 microbeads.Centrifuge the A-CD4+ cell suspension (from Step B14) at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant completely.Wash the freshly isolated CD4+ cells with 10 ml PBS to remove any proteins.

Aspirate the supernatant completely.Wash the cells once again with RPMI 1640. Aspirate the supernatant completely.Resuspend in 5 ml RPMI 1640 and count the cells.Note: After labeling with CFSE, perform flow cytometry analysis to ensure that the cells are stained. Centrifuge the A-CD8+CD28- cells, B-APCs, and I-APCs obtained above at 300 × g for 10 min.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant completely.Resuspend in 5 ml RPMI 1640 and count the corresponding cells.Centrifuge the A-CD8+CD28- cells, B-APCs, I-APCs, and A-CD4+CFSE at 300 × g for 10 min. Aspirate the supernatant completely.Resuspend the cell pellet in culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% FBS) to achieve A-CD4+CFSE at 1 × 106 cells/ml, B-APCs or I-APCs at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and A-CD8+CD28- cells at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml.Seed the A-CD4+CFSE cells (5 × 104/well), B- APCs or I-APCs (5 × 104/well), and CD8+CD28- cells (2.5 × 104/well) onto 96-well round-bottomed plates in a total volume of 200 μl cell culture medium containing 15% FBS.Note: Responder CD4+ T cells, stimulated with B-APCs or I-APCs, only served as positive controls (B-APCs were used as priming cells in vitro to expand CD8+CD28− T cells from individual A, whereas I-APCs had never had immune recognition by CD8+CD28− T cells from individual A during the in vitro expansion period). Change semi-culture medium (100 μl) after 3 days, 5 days, and 9 days of coculture.After 7 or 11 days of coculture, harvest, stain, and detect the CD4+ cells for CFSE dilution by flow cytometry.In vivo suppression assaysIsolate the responder CD4+ T cells and APCs (Procedure A and B).Mix a total of 4 × 106 human CD4+ T cells with an equal number of APCs, either B-APCs or I-APCs, and combine with 2 × 106in vitro-expanded human CD8+CD28− T cells in a total volume of 1.5 ml PBS.
