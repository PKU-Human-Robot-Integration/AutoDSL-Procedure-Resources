    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue isolation and digestion\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThese steps include dissection of the muscle tissue from the hindlimb of 3–5-week-old male mice, followed by mechanical and enzymatic digestion to liberate isolated myoblasts. Using mice 3–5 weeks old will ensure a robust yield of myoblasts. Older mice can be used but the myoblast yield will significantly decrease with age. A series of purification steps will then take place to yield a purified myoblast culture.\nDissect mice at 4 weeks of age.\nEuthanize the mouse by CO2 asphyxiation and spray the hind limb area with 70% ethanol.\nMake a horizontal incision on the lower abdominal area using Vannas scissors.\nPull down the skin to expose the hindlimb muscle (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2528-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection of muscle tissue from the mouse hindlimb\n(A) Exposed hindlimb muscle tissue.\n(B) Representative example of a thorough dissection of muscle tissue from the hindlimb.\n(C) Tissue pulp after mechanical sheering with dissecting Vannas scissors performed before exposure to digestion enzymes and shaking.\nUse dissecting scissors to cut off as much muscle tissue as possible (highlighted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nUsing curved, serrated forceps, place the harvested tissue in a 15 mL conical tube of HBSS on ice until ready to perform digestion steps (Repeat this step for the second hindlimb).\nTo begin digestion, discard the HBSS from the isolated muscle tissue, wash once with fresh HBSS and place on a petri dish on ice.\nMechanically sheer the tissue with dissecting Vannas scissors until you obtain a paste-like texture (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTransfer mixture to a clean, pre-weighed 15 mL conical tube and weigh the tissue.\nAdd 2 mL of Dispase II and 2 mL of Collagenase II enzyme solutions for each gram weight of tissue.",
    "Place the tube into a shaking water bath set to a speed of 150 strokes/min at 37°C for 20 min to begin the enzymatic digestion.\nAfter 20 min pipette the solution up and down at medium speed using a 10 mL pipette 20 times to assist with the dissociation of the tissue while leaving the cells intact.\nReturn to the water bath for another 10 min.\nRemove the tube and pipette up and down 20 times using a 5 mL pipette.\nAdd 4 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (D10) to the enzyme cell mixture and filter the entire content through a 100 μM sterile filter into a 50 mL conical tube to remove large debris and undigested tissue.\nNext, filter the flow-through, through a 40 μM sterile filter into a clean 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 800 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and wash the remaining cell pellet in 4 mL D10. Centrifuge once again at 800 × g for 5 min to pellet.\nAspirate the supernatant and wash the remaining cell pellet in 4 mL of D10.\nTransfer the cell mixture to a clean 15 mL conical tube.\nRepeat washes with 4 mL of D10 three times for a total of five washes. On the final wash, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend pellet in 5 mL of primary myoblast growth medium (PMGM growth medium) supplemented with fresh bFGF at a concentration of 1:10,000.\nAspirate gelatin from the pre-coated T25 flask (from step 1), and plate cell resuspension.\nCulture for 48 h for cellular expansion in a humidified 37°C incubator supplied with 5% CO2. At this step, myoblasts are considered to be at passage zero (P0).\nPurification and maintenance of primary myoblasts",
    "After 48 h of expansion, coat a new T25 flask with 2% gelatin for at least an hour and incubate PBS and primary myoblast growth medium in a 37°C water bath for 30 min.\nRemove the culture flask from the incubator and gently aspirate the culture medium and add 3 mL PBS to the flask and let it sit at room temperature for 2 min.\nAfter 2 min perform the negative selection purification method which takes advantage of the weak adherence properties of the myoblasts compared to fibroblast.\nHold the cell culture flasks firmly in your hand and subject it to a strong mechanical force by performing five firm taps gently hitting the flask against a hard surface on each side to dislodge the myoblasts while leaving the fibroblasts attached to the plate surface.\nWhen complete, visualize cells under the microscope to confirm myoblast detachment (suspended small rounded circular cells). Approximately 70% of the myoblasts will be detached.\nCritical: The remaining 30% of myoblasts will remain attached to the flask. This is expected and they should be left behind to ensure a pure myoblast culture. If you attempt to increase the mechanical force to dislodge all myoblasts, the risk of unwanted cell type transfer is high and will decrease the purity of the culture.\nCarefully add 3 mL primary myoblast growth medium to the culture flasks with the PBS and dislodged myoblasts being mindful not to scrape the cell culture surface and transfer the entire content to a 15 mL conical tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Centrifuge the suspended myoblasts at 300 ×g for 5 min to pellet the cells and aspirate the supernatant.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2528-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic highlighting dislodged primary myoblast capture",
    "Critical: When collecting dislodged myoblasts, avoid touching or scraping the cell flask surface (where the cells are adhered) as this may dislodge any unwanted cell types and introduce it to the myoblast culture (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of PMGM media supplemented with bFGF and return to the incubator for continued expansion.\nMyoblast growth cultures are then maintained and split every 48 h using a 1:10 Trypsin to PBS solution to continue to take advantage of the differential adherence properties of the purified myoblast vs fibroblast.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2528-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Characterization of purified myoblasts\n(A) Representative images showing the crude culture with a heterogeneous cell population (e.g., RBCs, fibroblast, myoblast) 48 h after plating (left) and purified culture of ∼90% myoblasts after two passages (right). Cells were fixed and immunostained for Pax7. Images were merged with Pax7 and phase contrast. Red arrows indicate fibroblasts without Pax7 stain. White arrows indicate myoblasts with Pax7 stain. Scale bars = 200 μm.\n(B and C) Expression of fibroblast markers (Fap and Tcf4) and muscle markers (Desmin and Pax7) genes normalized to the house keeping gene RPL13 in heterogeneous cell population and purified myoblast. Data represent mean ± SEM. ∗ is p-value <0.05, ∗∗ is p-value < 0.01 and ∗∗∗ is p-value < 0.001 by Student’s T test.\nNote: A greater than 95% myoblast purity will be achieved after passage 2 with a 1:10 trypsin split (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). After P2, myoblasts will be ready to move to a T75 for continual expansion.\nCritical: To ensure that the myoblasts remain in the proliferative state, always supplement the culture media with fresh bFGF when plating after each low trypsin split and ensure that the confluency does not exceed 50%. The bFGF will be stable in culture for up to 5 days.",
    "Note: All myoblasts cultured and expanded prior to the 1:10 low trypsin:PBS split are considered to be at passage 0. Every subsequent low trypsin:PBS split will increase the passage. Myoblasts perform well in culture up until passage 6 (P6). Primary myoblasts should be cryopreserved at a very early passage (P1-P2) for future SMS applications. Approximately 90% of the primary myoblasts will be recovered after cryopreserved cells are thawed.\nNote: Purified myoblast cultures can be visualized morphologically by eye or confirmed by extracting RNA and documenting a decline in fibroblast markers and an enrichment of myoblast marker genes such as Desmin or Pax7 (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nSmall molecule screening to assess regenerative capacity of myoblasts\nOption 1: Ex vivo knockout primary myoblasts: Adenoviral CRE-mediated excision of gene of interest (GOI)\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step will detail the preparation of an adenoviral CRE-mediated gene knockout in myoblasts for SMS to assess myoblast regenerative capacity as the primary readout. Myoblasts isolated from C57BL/6J mice with floxed alleles of Cox10 will be used as an example in this protocol but any floxed transgenic mouse model will be effective.\nNow that a purified myoblast culture has been obtained following steps 1–19, perform a 1:10 low trypsin: PBS split of the floxed myoblasts.\nSeed myoblasts in PMGM growth media at a concentration of 4 × 105 cells on a T75 gelatin-coated flask in 15 mL PMGM media.\nNote: You will need two T75 flasks: one for Adeno GFP infection and the other for the Adeno CRE infection.\nCulture for 24 h in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nAfter 24 h, begin the preparation of the adenovirus infection.\nFirst, calculate the desired Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) for your gene target (please see the critical section for how to perform this calculation).",
    "For the ex vivo deletion of Cox10 in primary myoblasts, an MOI of 250 was used.\nDilute 2.5 μL of stock GFP-expressing or Cre-expressing adenovirus (a titer of 4 × 1010 pfu/mL) to 1 mL pre-warmed PMGM growth medium.\nAdd directly to the 15 mL myoblast T75 culture flask and gently shake the flask to evenly distribute the adenovirus into the culture media.\nReturn the infected cell flask to the incubator and culture for an additional 72 h.\nTo check for infection efficiency, visualize the Adeno GFP expression using a fluorescent microscope after 72 h of viral incubation time.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2528-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. MOI of primary myoblasts with Ad5CMVeGFP\nMyoblasts were transduced with Ad5CMVeGFP at a MOI of 50 (Left), MOI of 100 (Middle) and MOI of 250 (Right) following steps 19–22. After 3 days, live myoblasts were imaged under fluorescent microscope. Scale bars = 200 μm.\nCritical: Myoblast should have 100% penetrance of the Adeno GFP viral expression (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). If this is not the case, then increase the MOI.\nAspirate the viral cell culture media and rinse cells gently with 3 mL of PBS.\nRemove the PBS, then trypsinize the virus treated myoblasts using 2 mL of a 1:10 Trypsin to PBS solution.\nCollect the trypsinized cells and place in a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 300×g for 5 min to pellet. Following the spin, aspirate the supernatant.\nTake an aliquot of 1 × 105 myoblasts from the Adeno GFP and Cre treatment groups and return the remaining cells to the incubator to continue with cellular expansion.\nCentrifuge Adeno GFP and CRE myoblast aliquots at 300×g for 5 min to obtain cell pellets.\nConfirm the protein target knockout in these cells using western blot and/or qPCR with appropriate target antibodies and/or primers.",
    "After confirming your GOI is successfully ablated, primary myoblasts can be used to establish a SMS dynamic range. See “Establishing the dynamic range” section.\nCritical: MOI is defined as the ratio of infectious agents to cells. Therefore, if 1 × 106 viral particles were added to 1 × 106 primary myoblasts with the assumption that each viral particle infected a single cell, then the MOI would be 1. The MOI needs to be empirically determined according to your GOI by both evaluating infection efficiency by using Adeno GFP penetrance as a proxy (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) in addition to performing standard immunoblotting techniques to determine if your GOI is ablated when infected with Adeno CRE. To establish an ex vivo KO of Cox10 in primary myoblasts, we utilized an MOI of 250.\nTo calculate the amount of virus needed after establishing MOI:\n  (Total number of myoblasts per flask or well) × (desired MOI) = total viral particles or plaque forming units (pfu) needed.\n  (Total pfu needed) / (pfu/mL functional titer) × 1000 = total μL of adenoviral particles to add to each flask or well.\n  Example calculation: For 1 × 105 of myoblasts, MOI of 250, and 4 × 1010 pfu/mL functional titer of stock adenoviral.\n    Total pfu needed = 1 × 105 × 250 = 250 × 105 pfu.\n    Total volume of adenoviral particles = 250 × 105 pfu / 4 × 1010 pfu/mL × 1000 = 0.625 μL of adenoviral particles.\nWhen handling adenovirus, please use the appropriate safety guidelines to both handle and discard all contaminated materials.\nOption 2: In vivo knockout primary myoblasts: Tamoxifen-induced CRE-mediated excision of GOI\nTiming: 2 weeks",
    "In lieu of knocking out your GOI ex vivo using adenovirus administration, this step will detail the isolation and purification of myoblasts from knockout mice that have already been exposed to the CRE recombinase in vivo. In this example, myoblasts will be isolated from the satellite cell-specific Cox10Flox/Pax7CRE-ERT2 mice to assess myoblast regenerative capacity as the primary readout in SMS. Mice are intraperitoneally injected with tamoxifen to induce the in vivo Cre-mediated excision of Cox10.\nWeigh two 4-week-old male Cox10Flox/Pax7CRE-ERT2 mice and administer either tamoxifen (KO group) or vehicle (control group) via intraperitoneal injections (IP) at a concentration of 30 mg/g body weight daily for 5 days.\nNote: After the 5th day of IP injection, leave mice undisturbed for 7 days with no injections. (“washout” period).\nEuthanize the mice with CO2 asphyxiation and isolate primary myoblasts and maintain in culture as detailed above in the “tissue isolation and digestion[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]” section (steps 1–19).\nConfirm the knockout using Western blot and qPCR as described in step 27.\nEstablishing the dynamic range for small molecule screens\nThis step will define the dynamic range between the baseline proliferation capacity of healthy control myoblasts compared to your GOI knockout myoblasts. This step is critical to establish the rescue potential of your SMS. This step is performed after validating the knockout efficiency and prior to initiating a screen.\nCoat three 96-well plates with 100 μL of 2% gelatin per well for at least 1 h.\nNote: Each plate will be dedicated to a Day 1, Day 3, or Day 5 timepoint evaluation when establishing the dynamic range.\nAfter an hour, remove the 2% gelatin from 96-well plates.\nTrypsinize a T-75 flask of primary myoblasts using the low trypsin split as described previously.",
    "Seed 30 wells of control and 30 wells of knockout myoblasts in 200 μL/well of PMGM growth media at a concentration of 2.4 × 103 cells/well according to the layout in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2528-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Establishing primary myoblast dynamic range for HTS\n(A) Schematic representation of the plate layout to evaluate growth dynamics between knockout and control myoblasts.\n(B) Representative example of dynamic growth difference between Cox10 knockout and Flox control myoblasts in a 24-well format over five days using Celigo. Inlay is a WB demonstrating successful KO of MT-CO1 (a proxy for Cox10). Data represent mean ± SEM.\n(C) End point dynamic growth dynamic difference between Cox10 knockout and flox control myoblasts using Cell Titer Glo assay. A ≥ 2-fold dynamic range is considered a successful for rescue in a SMS screen. Data represent mean ± SEM. ∗∗∗ is p-value < 0.001 by Student’s T test.\nAfter seeding, leave plates in the cell culture hood for 15 min at 37°C to allow myoblasts to briefly settle before placing them in the incubator.\nCulture for 24 h in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nFollowing the 24 h incubation time, prepare the staining buffer.\nFirst, calculate the amount of staining buffer needed: number of primary myoblast wells × 100 μL per well.\nNext, prepare the staining buffer by adding 0.5 μL of Hoechst stock solution and 2 μL of PI stock solution per 1 mL of pre-warmed serum free D10 media.\nAdd staining buffer to the myoblasts.\nSlowly remove 180 μL of culture medium from the cell plates with a multichannel pipette leaving behind 20 μL so that the primary myoblasts do not dry.\nAdd 100 μL of staining buffer per well to the myoblasts.",
    "Return the plate to the incubator and incubate for 45 min at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nRemove the cell plate from the incubator and perform the cell count using an automated cell counting instrument. As an example, we used the Nexcelom Celigo cytometer.\nRecord the myoblasts count labeled with Hoechst (Blue channel) and PI (Red Channel).\nThen calculate the live cell number as: Hoechst-stained cell number – PI-stained cell number for the control and KO myoblasts. This will be the dynamic range obtained after one day of culture.\nReplace medium in the remaining two 96-well plates.\nSlowly remove 180 μL of culture medium with a multichannel pipette leaving 20 μL behind.\nReplace it with 180 μL of fresh PMGM growth media.\nIncubate for an additional 48 h.\nRepeat steps 35–40 and record the dynamic range of the control and knockout myoblasts for the Day 3 and Day 5 timepoints (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nDetermine which culture timepoint gives the maximal dynamic range.\nNote: A ≥ 2-fold dynamic range would be considered successful for rescue potential in a screen. For COX10 KO primary myoblasts, the maximal culture dynamic range was acheived at 5 days and is the endpoint of the SMS (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nCritical: Never aspirate culture media using a vacuum manifold when in a 96-well format. The weak adherent properties of myoblasts will cause the cells to dislodge.\nNote: Place 200 μL of PBS in the wells surrounding the perimeter of the 96-well plate to minimize edge effects.\nNote: Control myoblasts should reach 80% confluency on Day 5, if longer culture time is required, seeding density should be adjusted accordingly.\nNote: Other cellular quantification methods such as the Cell Titer Glo can be utilized to establish the dynamic range in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B.\nInitiating a small molecule screen in primary myoblasts",
    "This step will detail the initiation of a small molecule screen in primary myoblasts using cellular regenerative capacity as the primary readout. Although the use of small molecules is highlighted in this section, employing siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 libraries are also robust options. Furthermore, other readouts such as tagged proteins or fluorescent expression constructs will be equally effective utilizing these methods. This step is initiated after the appropriate dynamic range and experimental culture endpoints have been established.\nCoat two 96-well plates with 2% gelatin according to the guidelines outlined in step 32.\nNote: Each plate will be an independent screen replicate to ensure SMS rigor and reproducibility.\nAfter 1 h, remove the gelatin.\nSeed 2.4 × 103 flox control and knockout myoblasts per well in 100 μL of PMGM supplemented with bFGF according to the plate layout outlined in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2528-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Seeding plate layout for SMS\nIncubate myoblasts for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nFollowing incubation, expose the KO myoblasts to a unique small biomolecule by administering directly into the well.\nNote: Compound concentration must be determined empirically but a typical starting concentration for SMS applications is 10–25 μM. Small biomolecules are tested in duplicate following the plate layout in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] to allow for the comprehensive profiling for up to 27 small biomolecules per plate.\nAfter compound administration, gently swirl the cell culture plate to ensure even distribution.\nReturn the plates to the incubator to culture for 5 days or according to your established experimental endpoint defined in section “Establishing Dynamic Range”.\nAfter 5 days, assess the rescue potential of the small biomolecules by measuring myoblast regenerative capacity as described previously following steps 35–39.\nAnalyze the data.",
    "Calculate the fold rescue potential of each small biomolecule for both screen replicate plates according to the equation detailed in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2528-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Analysis screen result using fold change\n(A) Equation to calculate rescue potential fold change (top), and two representative examples of how to apply the equation with two screen replicates.\n(B) Schematic representation of an X-Y plot of two replicate biogenic small molecule screen. X axis, Biomolecules screen replicate 1. Y axis, Biomolecules screen replicate 2. FC threshold was set to 1.3. Negative biomolecules that failed to cross the FC threshold on both screen replicate plates are located at lower left quadrant or that crossed the FC threshold on only one of the screen replicate plates are located at the upper left quadrant and lower right quadrant. Positive biomolecules that crossed the FC threshold on both screen replicate plates are located at the upper right quadrant.\nThen plot data from both SMS replicates 1 and 2 against each other to define Pearson’s correlation coefficient (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nNote: This will assess rigor and reproducibility of the SMS. Compounds that yield a 30% rescue (1.3-fold) or greater for both screen plates are scored as positive biomolecules for downstream analyses, but this can be empirically defined according to your specific application.\nCritical: Compounds are only scored positive if they cross the fold-change threshold on both screen plate replicates (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B). That said, be mindful of false-positive and false-negative results. It is heavily encouraged to closely evaluate the original values for all 4 candidate replicate values to identify potential outliers that may influence and sway the fold change calculations.\nNote: Positive lead biomolecules candidates must be validated by performing 1) downstream concentration dose response analyses to identify the optimal drug concentration and 2) time course analyses to define drug dynamics.",
    "Note: As cell proliferation is a proxy for myoblast regenerative capacity, it is critical that myoblasts are evenly seeded at the beginning of the assay. A cell count 3 h post seeding in step 43 using the phase-contrast scan on an automated cell counter is recommended. These values can then be used to confirm that cells were evenly seeded and can be further for normalization purposes.\nNote: If the investigator has access to automated robotic seeding and dispensing equipment platforms such as the Thermo-Fisher Combi Reagent Dispenser and the Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handler, then step 42 can be advanced to a high-throughput screening (HTS) capacity. The modification to HTS is as follows:\nStep 42- Increase the number of 96-well culture plates as desired. For typical HTS, approximately 30–40 plates are seeded at a time."
