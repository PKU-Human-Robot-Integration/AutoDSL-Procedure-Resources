    "1. Buffers and reagents\nCell growth media for HepG2/C3A cells: Prepare Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, 4.5g/L glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), non-essential amino acids (1% v/v), L-glutamine (1% v/v) and penicillin/streptomycin (0.5% v/v). Store the growth media at 4 °C.\nCell growth media for THLE-3 cells: Prepare bronchial epithelial cell growth medium [BEGM] containing its supplements (bovine pituitary extract [BPE], hydrocortisone, human epidermal growth factor [hEGF], epinephrine, transferrin, insulin, retinoic acid, triiodothyronine, gentamicin sulfate-amphotericin [GA]) as well as 10% FBS, 5 ng/mL hEGF and 70 ng/mL phosphoetanolamine.\n500 mM DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT): To prepare 10 mL, resuspend 0.771 g of DTT in 10 mL of HPLC grade water. Store 100 µL aliquots at -20 °C.\n200 mM iodoacetamide: To prepare 1 mL, resuspend 36 mg of iodoacetamide in 1 mL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Do not store resuspended iodoacetamide.\n5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS): To prepare 50 mL, resuspend 2.5 g of SDS in 50 mL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Store at 4 °C.\n12% phosphoric acid: To prepare 100 mL, dilute 14.1 mL of 85% phosphoric acid in 85.9 mL of HPLC grade water. Store in a glass bottle at room temperature (RT).\nBinding buffer: To prepare 1 L, add 900 mL of concentrated methanol to 100 mL of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate or TEAB.\n0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) solution: Add 1 mL of concentrated TFA to 999 mL of HPLC grade water. Store at 4 °C.\n60% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA solution: Add 600 mL of HPLC grade acetonitrile (60% v/v) to 399 mL of HPLC grade water. Next, add 1 mL of concentrated TFA to this solution, then store at 4 °C.",
    "Mobile Phase A (MPA) - 0.1% formic acid: Add 1 mL of concentrated formic acid to 999 mL of HPLC-grade water and mix well.\nMobile Phase B (MPB) - 80% HPLC-grade acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid: Add 800 mL of HPLC-grade acetonitrile to 199 mL of HPLC-grade water. Next, add 1 mL of concentrated formic acid to this solution and mix.\n2. Preparation of spheroids\nNOTE: Figure 1A represents the initial steps for preparing and culturing 3D spheroids from cell lines.\nThaw frozen HepG2/C3A and THLE-3 cells and grow them as a monolayer using standard growth media in a tissue culture flask or dish until they reach approximately 80% confluency.\n\tNOTE: When cells reach confluency, check the general cellular morphology and growth patterns using a microscope. It is not recommended to use cells at high passage numbers.\nWash cells twice with Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, use 5 mL for a T75 cm2 flask or 10 cm dish).\nAdd 5 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA diluted in HBSS (1:2 dilution) and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Use a microscope to assess cell detachment and add 3 mL of FBS or growth media (containing 10% FBS) to neutralize trypsin reaction.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube. Spin down at 270 x g at RT for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 mL of complete growth media.\n\tNOTE: If there are too many cells, dilute the cell suspension before counting.\nCount the number of cells and dilute the cell suspension in complete growth media to obtain 1 x 106 in a maximum volume of 1.5 mL.\nEquilibrate an ultra-low attachment 24-well round bottom plate containing microwells.\n\t\nWash the wells with 0.5 mL of growth media.",
    "Centrifuge the plate at 3,000 x g for 5 min (this removes air bubbles from the surface of wells).\nTransfer the cell suspension (prepared in step 1.4) into the plate and centrifuge for 3 min at 120 x g.\n\tNOTE: The cell suspension volume may vary depending on the cell count, but it is important to limit it to 1.5 mL.\nIncubate the plate for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to begin spheroid formation.\n3. Spheroids culture into bioreactors (Figure 2)\nNOTE: To preserve the structure of spheroids, use wide bore tips when handling 3D spheres.\nEquilibrate the bioreactor by filling the humidity chamber with 25 mL of sterile water and the cell chamber with 9 mL of growth media 24 h before transferring the spheroids to it (Figure 2A). Be sure to use a 10 mL syringe coupled to a long needle when filling humidity and cell chambers.\nIncubate the bioreactor, rotating (15 rpm) in the 3D incubator (Figure 2D,F), for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nUsing 1 mL wide bore tips, gently pipette up and down to detach spheroids from the ultra-low attachment plate and transfer the spheroids to a tissue culture dish.\nWash the ultra-low attachment plate with 0.5 mL of pre-warmed growth media to capture leftover spheroids and transfer them to the same dish from step 3.3.\nAssess spheroids' size, compactness, and roundness using a light microscope (4x magnification) and select the ones that are sufficiently formed.\n\tNOTE: Cells are sufficiently formed when they are compact and do not fall apart during handling. It is also important that spheroids are a single unit and not clumped together. A spheroid size between 100-200 µm is preferred when transferred to the bioreactor.",
    "Transfer spheroids into the equilibrated bioreactor filled with 5 mL of fresh growth media. After transferring the spheroids, completely fill the bioreactor with fresh growth media, and be sure to avoid adding bubbles to the bioreactor when filling it with media.\nPlace the bioreactor in the 3D incubator and adjust the rotation speed using the control unit (Figure 2C). For HepG2/C3A spheroids, set the rotation speed to 10-11 rpm; for THLE-3 spheroids, set it to 11-12 rpm.\n\tNOTE: The rotation speed is correctly set when the spheroids are evenly distributed in the center of the bioreactor and not touching its walls. Figure 2E shows a rotating bioreactor.\nExchange growth media every 2-3 days by removing 10 mL of old media and replacing it with 10 mL of fresh media; be sure not to remove spheroids when exchanging media (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to have a routine of media exchange (for example, 48 h/48 h/72 h) and keep a detailed record.\nAdjust rotation speed every time media is changed. Increase the speed as spheroids grow in size and number.\nAfter 15 days in culture, split spheroids into two new bioreactors.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the cell line and growth rate, the time may vary and should be optimized individually.\nAfter 20 days, spheroids are ready for collection.\n4. Image capture and counting of spheroids\nNOTE: The simplified pipeline for spheroids count is shown in Figure 3A. For spheroids count and area determination (section 5), it is critical to evaluate the compactness of the 3D structures. This will contribute to a more enhanced color contrast, which is necessary for the method to be accurate.\nOpen the 3D app installed on the tablet.\nSelect the bioreactor and take a snapshot.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, a picture can be taken. The following parameters should be considered.\n\t\nPlace a black background behind the bioreactor (black support is provided in the bioreactor box).\nEnsure there is no light reflection on the cell chamber.\nTake the picture as close to the bioreactor as possible.\nOpen one picture in FIJI (ImageJ).\nPrepare the picture for analysis:\n\t\nSelect the Oval tool. Draw a circle around the plug.\nClick Delete on the keyboard to make everything inside the circle black. Draw a circle around the cell chamber. Make sure that all spheroids are inside the circle.\nRun macro to count spheroids:\n\t\nClick Plugins > Macro > Record. Copy macro text from Supplementary File 1 into the recorder.\nPress Create, and a new window will open. Press Run to analyze the picture opened.\nA new window will open with the results (count, total area, average size, and percentage area).\nClose the image and repeat steps 4.4 and 4.5 for each image for which the spheroid count is needed. For easier and quicker processing, save the macro and run it by clicking Plugins > Macro > Run and select the saved macro.\n5. Planimetric determination of the spheroid area\nNOTE: The simplified pipeline for determining the spheroid area is shown in Figure 3B.\nTake images as described in step 3.5.\nBefore starting, set a global scale to measure the area of the spheroids.\n\t\nOpen in FIJI a picture with a scale bar with the desired magnification. Select the line tool. Draw over the scale bar (the line needs to be as long as the scale bar is).\nOpen Analyze > Set Scale. Write the know distance (the length of the line is automatically entered in the Distance in Pixels. Make sure to tick Global.",
    "Press OK. Now the scale is set for the picture that will be analyzed.\nTo start the planimetric determination, run the macro (Supplementary File 2).\n\t\nClick Process > Batch > Macro. Choose the folder that contains the pictures to be analyzed. This folder will be the Input.\nChoose the folder created in step 5.3.1 as Output. Press Process.\nAs a quality check, evaluate if the spheroid area measured corresponds to the original image.\n\tNOTE: Macro excludes spheroids on the edge where only a part of the spheroid can be measured.\n6. Collection of spheroids\nNOTE: It is strongly advised that spheroids are collected using wide bore tips to preserve their 3D structure. The collection can be done by using the plug in the front of the bioreactor (Figure 2A).\nThe size of spheroids at collection may vary depending on the cell line, starting number of cells, and splitting process (days in culture, number of spheroids per bioreactor, and splitting ratio).\nTo collect spheroids, remove 5 mL of media from the bioreactor through the top port using a syringe coupled to a long needle. Be sure to let spheroids sink to the bottom center of the bioreactor (near the bottom port).\nOpen the front port and collect spheroids using a 1 mL wide bore tip. Place the spheroids in microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the spheroids at 500 x g for 5 min and discard media.\nWash the spheroids with 200 µL of HBSS to remove the FBS. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nSnap-freeze the spheroid pellet with liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until processing.\n7. Viability of spheroids",
    "NOTE: Spheroid viability was determined by measuring the activity of the adenylate kinase (AK) released by damaged cells (Figure 4A). Due to the diffusion gradient, AK measurement is efficient when spheroids are smaller than 900 µm in diameter12. If the spheroids become larger, or if there is any doubt regarding the viability measurement, an ATP assay can be performed15.\nCollect the spheroid supernatant and transfer 20 µL to a 96-well white-walled plate (flat bottom clear). Add 100 µL of adenylate kinase detection reagent to each well and homogenize by gently pipetting up and down.\nRemove bubbles by centrifugation in the speed vacuum for 2 min at RT. Incubate the plates for 20 min at RT.\nPlace the plate in the luminometer (plate reader, luminescence mode) and initiate the program. Set the parameters according to the kit manufacturer's instructions.\n\t​NOTE: In bioluminescent viability assays, the direct luminometer light output (commonly RLUs) may be used to calculate the cell response. As adenylate kinase will only leak from cells whose cell integrity has been compromised, it is possible to achieve a total adenylate kinase control by using a lysis reagent.\n8. Protein extraction\nNOTE: Figure 1B represents the workflow for spheroids processing and protein extraction.\nCollect spheroids (section 6) on day 36. Resuspend spheroids in 25 µL of 5% SDS to lyse the cells.\n\t\nAfter adding 5% SDS, homogenize the pellet by pipetting up and down. In some cases when it is difficult to lyse the spheroids, use a small pestle.\nIncubate the samples with 20 mM DTT for 1 h to reduce proteins. Mix by pipetting up and down.\nIncubate samples with 40 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min protected from light to alkylate proteins. Mix by pipetting up and down.",
    "Add 12% phosphoric acid solution (10x) to the samples at a final concentration of 1.2%.\nDilute samples in six volumes of binding buffer and gently mix.\nLoad the sample to an S-Trap filter plate and spin down at 500 x g for 30 s.\n\tNOTE: If the total volume of the sample in step 8.4 exceeds the column volume capacity, load samples in batches and repeat step 8.6 until everything is passed through the column.\nWash the samples twice with 150 µL of binding buffer. After each wash, spin down at 500 x g for 30 s and discard the flow through.\nIncubate the samples with 1 µg of sequencing-grade trypsin diluted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: At least 20 µg of protein is recommended as starting material for comprehensive proteome analysis. For this, 1 µg of trypsin is the ideal amount for efficient digestion. Remove any bubbles between the buffer and the column bed.\nElute peptides with 40 µL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and pool into the same collection tube.\nSpin down at 500 x g for 30 s. Elute peptides with 40 µL of 0.1% TFA and pool them into the same collection tube.\nSpin down at 500 x g for 30 s. Elute the peptides with 40 µL of 60% acetonitrile and 0.1 % TFA and pool them into the same collection tube.\nSpin down at 500 x g for 30 s. Dry pooled eluates in the speed vacuum and store the samples at -80 °C until processing.\n9. Sample cleanup",
    "NOTE: Before proceeding to the proteomics analysis, it is necessary to remove the salt present in the samples. Salts can interfere with high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis as they ionize during electrospray, suppressing the signal from peptides. The setup for de-salting used in this study was previously demonstrated by Joseph-Chowdhury and colleagues16.\nBefore starting, ensure there is a clean 96-well collection plate to collect the flow through during the following steps. Mix the C18 resin (50 mg/mL in 100% acetonitrile) on a magnetic stir plate.\nAdd 70 µL of the C18 resin suspension per well of the 96-well filter plate, do this swiftly to ensure that C18 resin does not pool at the bottom of the pipette.\nTurn on the vacuum gently to prevent splashing. Discard the flow-through collected on the 96-well collection plate.\nWash the resin with 100 µL of 0.1% TFA. Turn on the vacuum gently to prevent splashing and mixing of samples and discard the flow through.\nResuspend each sample in 100 µL of 0.1% TFA. Check and ensure that the pH is between 2-3.\nLoad each sample into each well of the filter plate. Turn on the vacuum gently to prevent splashing and mixing of samples and discard the flow through.\nWash with 100 µL of 0.1% TFA. Turn on the vacuum gently to prevent splashing and mixing of samples. Discard the flow through.\nReplace the 96-well collection plate with a new 96-well plate to collect the de-salted samples.\nAdd 60 µL of acetonitrile/0.1% TFA per well. To elute the samples from the C18 resin, turn on the vacuum gently to prevent splashing.\nCollect the flow through and dry in a speed vacuum at RT. Proceed to LC-MS/MS or store the plate at -80 °C until ready to process the samples.",
    "10. Proteomics analysis via liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry\nNOTE: To generate the data for this manuscript, a nLC-MS/MS system with a two-column system setup with a 300 µm ID x 0.5 cm C18 trap column and a 75 µm ID x 25 cm C18-AQ (3 µm) analytical nano-column packed in-house was used.\nPrepare the mobile phases to run on the HPLC:\n\tMobile Phase A (MPA): 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water\n\tMobile Phase B (MPB): 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade acetonitrile\nProgram the HPLC method as follows: 4%-34% MPB over 120 min, 34%-90% MPB over 5 min, isocratic 90% MPB over 5 min; flow rate: 300 nL/min.\nSet up the MS acquisition method to perform data-independent acquisition (DIA) to generate MS/MS spectra of the detected peptide signals.\nResuspend 1 µg of samples in 10 µL of 0.1% TFA prior to placing the samples in the nLC autosampler.\nRun the nLC-MS method as programmed for canonical proteomics acquisition:\n\t\nSet full MS scan to 300-1100 m/z in the orbitrap, with a resolution of 120,000 (at 200 m/z) and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 125.\nSet MS/MS in the orbitrap with sequential isolation window of 50 m/z with an AGC target of 400 and a Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) energy of 30.\n11. Data analysis\nImport the nLC-MS/MS raw data files into a peak detection software compatible with the MS platform used.\nSelect the proper database (human, mouse, etc).\nSet N-terminal acetylation as variable modification and carbamidomethyl cysteine as fixed modification.\nSpecify trypsin as the digestive enzyme with two missed cleavage allowed.\nSet mass tolerance accordingly to the mass analyzer utilized for the spectra acquisition.\nExport the analysis as a spreadsheet and process the data further as needed."
