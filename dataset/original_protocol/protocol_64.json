    "<p> \n<strong>Part I: Generation of raw replication timing datasets</strong> \n \n<p><strong>PROTOCOL 1. BrdU labeling and staining of cells for FACS</strong></p> \n \n<p>This protocol can be performed using PI staining and ethanol fixation prior to sorting \\(<strong>option A</strong>), or, for cells that break or clump in ethanol, by collecting cells following pulse labeling with BrdU and treating with a DAPI staining solution containing Triton X-100 to permeabilize cell membranes \\(<strong>option B</strong>).  The drawback of option B is that cells need to be sorted immediately following staining.</p> \n \n<p><strong>A. Labeling and PI staining of cells for FACs following ethanol fixation - TIMING 3.5 h</strong></p> \n \n<p>1. For adherent cells, remove cell culture medium and replenish with fresh medium.    Add BrdU at a final concentration of 50µM.  For suspension cells, add BrdU to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 50µM.<br /> \n2. Incubate cells for two hours in a carbon dioxide incubator at 37ºC, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.<br /> \n  3. For adherent cells, rinse gently with ice-cold PBS twice. For suspension cells, collect cells  in a 15mL tube and proceed directly to step 6.<br /> \n  4. Detach adherent cells using 0.2X Trypsin-EDTA for 2-3 minutes or Accutase for 3-6 minutes.<br /> \n  <strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> Incubate cells at 37 ºC with the enzyme treatment and/or use gentle trituration if necessary to achieve a single cell suspension, as this is necessary for accurate FACS sorting.<br /> \n5. Add 5mL of cell culture medium \\(containing FBS if trypsin has been used) to the cell culture dish or flask, pipette gently, and transfer contents to a 15mL round bottom tube.<br /> \n  6. Count the number of cells collected using a  hemacytometer.<br /> \n  7. Centrifuge at approximately 200 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes.<br /> \n  8. Aspirate supernatant carefully and resuspend cells in 2.5 mL of ice-cold PBS containing 1% FBS.<br />",
    "9. Add 7.5 mL of ice-cold 100% ethanol dropwise while gently vortexing.<br /> \n  <strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> Note that gentle vortexing is required.<br /> \n10. Seal the cap of the 15 mL tube with parafilm and mix gently but thoroughly.<br /> \n  11. <strong>PAUSE POINT</strong> Proceed to the next step to begin PI staining or stop here and store tubes in the dark at -20ºC indefinitely.<br /> \n  12. Resuspend the BrdU-labeled, ethanol fixed cells by tapping and inverting the tube.<br /> \n  13. Transfer 4 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> - 8 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells to a 5 mL polystyrene round bottom tube.<br /> \n  14. Centrifuge at approximately 200 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes.<br /> \n  15. Decant supernatant carefully<br /> \n  16. Add 2 mL of PBS with 1% FBS and mix well by tapping the tube.<br /> \n  17. Centrifuge at approximately 200 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes.<br /> \n  18. Decant supernatant carefully.<br /> \n  19. Resuspend cell pellet in PBS with 1% FBS to achieve a solution of 3 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL.<br /> \n  20. Add 1mg/mL propidium iodide to a final concentration of 50 µg mL.<br /> \n  21. Add 10 mg/mL RNase A to a final concentration of 250 µg/mL.<br /> \n  22. Tap the tube to mix and incubate for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark.<br /> \n  23. Filter cells by pipeting them through 37 micron nylon mesh into a 5 mL polystyrene round bottom tube.<br /> \n  24. Keep samples on ice in the dark and proceed directly to FACS sorting.</p> \n   \n<p><strong>B. BrdU labeling and DAPI staining of cells for FACS - TIMING 3 h</strong></p> \n \n<p>1. Remove cell culture medium from growing cells and replace with cell culture medium containing BrdU at a final concentration of 50uM.<br /> \n2. Incubate cells for two hours in a carbon dioxide incubator at 37ºC, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.<br />",
    "3. Rinse adherent cells gently with ice-cold PBS twice.<br /> \n  4. Detach adherent cells using 0.2X Trypsin-EDTA for 2-3 minutes or Accutase for 3-6 minutes.<br /> \n  <strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> Incubate cells at 37 ºC with the enzyme treatment and/or use gentle trituration if necessary to achieve a single cell suspension, as this is necessary for accurate FACS sorting<br /> \n5. Add 5mL of cell culture medium \\(containing FBS if trypsin has been used) to the cell culture dish or flask, pipette gently, and transfer contents to a 15mL tube.  Count the number of cells collected using a hemacytometer.<br /> \n  6. Centrifuge at approximately 200 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes.<br /> \n  7. Aspirate the supernatant carefully.<br /> \n  8. Add 5mL of ice-cold PBS and pipette gently but thoroughly.<br /> \n  9. Centrifuge at approximately 200 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes.<br /> \n  10. Aspirate supernatant carefully.<br /> \n  11. Resuspend the cell pellet in DAPI staining solution \\(1 X PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100  and 2µg/mL DAPI) to achieve a solution of 5 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> – 10 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL.<br /> \n  12. Filter cells by pipeting them through 37 micron nylon mesh into a 5 mL polystyrene round bottom tube.<br /> \n  13. Keep samples on ice in the dark and proceed directly to FACS sorting.</p> \n   \n<p><strong>PROTOCOL 2. FACS sorting fractions of S-phase - TIMING 1 h</strong></p>",
    "<p>This protocol describes the use of flow cytometry to sort cells based on DNA content.  Electrostatic sorting is performed as described here on a BD \\(Becton-Dickinson) FACS Aria flow cytometer.  During FACS analysis forward and side scatter analyses should be used to select an appropriate population of cells free of doublets or cell debris, both of which can hinder accurate sorting of desired populations.  Lasers used in this protocol include 488 Blue to detect PI or 407 Violet to detect DAPI in cells that have been stained for DNA content.  Two separate fractions of S phase, early and late, are chosen to be collected, but more can be collected if desired<sup>9,10</sup>.</p> \n \n<p>1. Run sample on FACS Aria cell sorter \\(Any comparable cell sorter can be used)<br /> \n<strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> It is very important to keep all samples chilled on ice or at 4ºC during FACS analysis to avoid cell cycle progression in the absence of BrdU.  Protect samples from light.<br /> \n2. Use forward and side scatter information to select the desired population of cells to be included in the sort.<br /> \n  3. Create a histogram that plots cell count on the y-axis and DNA content \\(fluorochrome intensity) on the x-axis.  See <strong>Fig.1A</strong><br /> \n  4. Select two distinct S-phase populations to be sorted into separate fractions as indicated in Fig.1.<br /> \n  5. Store cell immediately on ice in the dark until all samples have been sorted.  Cells are sorted into fresh 5ml round bottom tubes and kept at 4ºC during the sort.<br /> \n  6. Centrifuge at 400g for 10 minutes at 4ºC.  Alternatively, if fewer than 150,000 cells have been collected for each fraction, proceed directly to step 8.<br /> \n  7. Decant supernatant gently, only once.<br />",
    "<strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> The cell pellet can easily become loose. Some residual sheath fluid can be left in the tube.<br /> \n8. Add 1 mL of SDS-PK buffer containing 0.2mg/mL Proteinase K and 0.05mg/mL<br /> \n  glycogen for every 100,000 cells collected and mix vigorously by tapping the tube.<br /> \n9. Incubate samples in a 56ºC water bath for 2 hours.<br /> \n  10. Mix sample thoroughly and aliquot 200µl, equivalent to approximately 20,000 cells, per 1.5 mL tube.<br /> \n  11. Stop here and store samples at -20ºC in the dark or proceed directly to step 12.<br /> \n  <strong>PAUSE POINT</strong> Samples can be stored for at least 6 months before use.<br /> \n12. Add 200µl SDS-PK buffer with 0.05mg/mL glycogen to each aliquot and proceed<br /> \n  directly to BrdU immunoprecipitation.</p> \n \n<p><strong>PROTOCOL 3.  BrdU immunoprecipitation - TIMING 2 d</strong></p> \n \n<p>This protocol begins with cells that have been pulse labeled with BrdU and sorted into different cell cycle stages by FACS. Here DNA from these cells is sonicated into fragments ranging from 250bp to 2kb and then immunoprecipitated using an anti-BrdU antibody.  Immunoprecipitated DNA is then purified and ready for use in further steps of replication timing analysis for a time period of up to one month.  If samples have been stored at -20ºC prior to beginning the immunopreciptation, thaw samples in a 56ºC water bath and add 200µl of SDS-PK Buffer pre-warmed to 56ºC with 0.05mg/mL glycogen to each sample prior to performing the phenol-chloroform extraction in step 13.</p> \n \n<p>13. Extract once with phenol-chloroform, collecting the upper phase in a 1.5mL tube.<br /> \n14. Extract once with chloroform, collecting the upper phase in a 1.5mL tube.<br /> \n  15. Add 1 volume of isopropanol and mix well.<br /> \n  16. Store at -20ºC for 20 minutes.<br />",

Centrifuge at 16.1 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes at 4ºC, then remove all ethanol and let the pellet dry.<br /> \n  20. Resuspend the pellet in 500µl 1x TE.<br /> \n  <strong>PAUSE POINT</strong> Stop here and store overnight   at 4ºC or proceed directly to step 21.<br /> \n21. Sonicate DNA to an average size of ~0.7-0.8 kb.<br /> \n  22. Incubate sample at 95ºC for 5 minutes to heat denature.<br /> \n  23. Cool sample on ice for 2 minutes.<br /> \n  24. Add 60µl of 10X IP Buffer to a clean 1.5mL tube.<br /> \n  25. Add the denatured DNA to the tube containing 60µl 10X IP Buffer.<br /> \n  26. Add 40µl of 12.5 µg/ml anti-BrdU antibody.<br /> \n  27. Incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature with constant rocking.<br /> \n  <strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> Foil tubes to keep samples in the dark.<br /> \n28. Add 20µg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG.<br /> \n  <strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> Foil tubes to keep samples in the dark.<br /> \n29. Incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature with constant rocking.<br /> \n  30. Centrifuge at 16.1 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes at 4ºC<br /> \n  31. Remove supernatant completely.<br /> \n  <strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> If pellet becomes loose, then centrifuge sample again in order to completely remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.  Several centrifugations may be necessary to completely remove supernatant.<br /> \n32. Add 750µl of 1X IP Buffer that has been chilled on ice.<br /> \n  33. Centrifuge at 16.1 <em>g</em> for 5 minutes at 4ºC.<br /> \n  34. <strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> Remove supernatant completely, as in step 31.<br /> \n  35. Resuspend the pellet in 200µl digestion buffer with freshly added 0.25mg/mL proteinase K.<br /> \n  <strong>PAUSE POINT</strong> Incubate samples overnight at 37ºC.<br />",
    "36. Add 100µl of fresh digestion buffer with freshly added 0.25mg/mL proteinase K.<br /> \n  37. Incubate samples for 60 minutes at 56ºC.<br /> \n  38. Extract once with phenol-chloroform, collecting the upper phase in a 1.5mL tube.<br /> \n  39. Extract once with chloroform, collecting the upper phase in a 1.5mL tube.<br /> \n  40.

    "<p>To ensure quality, BrdU-IPs are screened by PCR amplification using primers specific to DNA markers of known relative replication time \\(i.e. early or late).  As PCR results can vary between aliquots of the same sample and replication timing changes during development<sup>2,3</sup>, consistency across multiple samples from the same cell type is the most reliable way to assess the quality of IP samples. Among the mouse sequences listed below, mitochondrial DNA replicates throughout the cell cycle<sup>11</sup> and is equally represented in early and late S-phase fractions. Alpha-globin, Pou5f1 and Mmp15 are generally early replicating markers, whereas beta-globin, Zfp42, Dppa2, Ptn, Mash1, and Akt3 are generally late replicating markers. Zfp42 and Dppa2 are early replicating in ESCs whereas they are late replicating in all somatic cell types examined to date. Among the human sequences listed below, mitochondrial DNA is equally represented in early and late S-phase fractions, while alpha-globin, MMP15 and BMP1 are generally early replicating markers. PTGS2, NETO1, SLITRK6, ZFP42 and DPPA2 are generally late replicating.

PCR method for quality control of BrdU-immunoprecipitation - TIMING 5 h</strong></p> \n \n<p>45. Prepare enough PCR master-mix to screen all IP samples with each primer set.

Aliquot 11.5 uL master-mix per tube and add 1 uL IP sample.<br /> \n47. Run samples in thermocycler with an initial denaturation step of 94˚C for 2 min, followed by 38 cycles of 94˚C for 45 sec, 60˚C for 45 sec and 72˚C for 2 min, and then a final elongation step of  72˚C for 5 min.<br /> \n  48. Add 2.5 uL 6x loading dye to every 12.5 uL reaction and load 6 uL onto 1.5% agarose gel.<br /> \n  49. Score each IP based on anticipated enrichment of amplicon DNA.<br /> \n  <strong>CRITICAL STEP</strong> Before proceeding, verify sample quality with corresponding primer sets listed above.<br /> \n50. If several IPs of the same sample and S-phase fraction pass the screening, pool equal amounts of each IP to a final volume of 50 uL \\(e.g. If two IP pass, combine 25 uL of each to pool).</p> \n   \n<p>***** Mitochondrial primer sets should be used at 1.0 uM concentration instead of 0.5 uM. For this master-mix add 0.63 uL F/R 20uM combined primers and 9.31 uL nuclease-free water per reaction.</p>",
    "<p><strong>PROTOCOL 5. Whole Genome Amplification - TIMING 8 h</strong></p> \n \n<p>Once purified by immunoprecipitation and screened for sample quality, BrdU incorporated DNA must be amplified  to obtain sufficient amounts for array hybridization. If multiple samples pass PCR screening, DNA from parallel immunoprecipitations can be pooled together and used as the starting material for whole genome amplification. Otherwise, a single screened immunoprecipitation is used. Whole genome amplification \\(WGA) is performed using GenomePlex Complete Whole Genome Amplification Kit \\(Sigma Catalog Number WGA2) followed by GenomePlex WGA Reamplification Kit \\(Sigma Catalog Number WGA3). Amplified samples are then  loaded onto a gel to determine size range and screened once more by PCR to ensure no bias was introduced during amplification.</p> \n \n<p>51. Precipitate DNA fractions by adding 1.25 uL 2 mg/mL glycogen, 20 uL 10M ammonium acetate and 150 uL ethanol to each 50 uL IP sample \\(If pooling multiple samples, 50 uL total volume should still be used). Mix well, let stand at -20˚C for 20 min, then centrifuge for 30 min at max speed and 4˚C.<br /> \n52. Rinse pellets with 70% ethanol, air dry and resuspend in 10 uL nuclease free water.<br /> \n  53.

S/G1 FACS Sorting \\(Alternative to Steps 1-57) - TIMING 1 d</strong></p> \n \n<p>In this method, cells are sorted into two fractions, G1 phase and S phase, based on DNA content, and replication timing is derived from the 2-fold copy number increase for early vs. late replicating sequences in pure S-phase populations.  DNA analysis using flow cytometry can be performed simply by the use of a single DNA-binding fluorescent dye such as PI or DAPI as originally described.  The advantage of this method is that it eliminates the need for BrdU-IP and whole genome amplification steps \\(described below), which need to be carefully controlled. However, direct comparisons have shown that this method produces a lower signal to noise ratio than protocol 1<sup>1</sup>.</p> \n \n<p>58. For adherent cells, remove cell culture medium from exponentially growing cells and replace with cell culture medium containing BrdU at a final concentration of 10 uM.   For suspension cells, add BrdU to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 10µM. In order to obviate the amplification step prior to labeling and array hybridization, start with 6 million cells. One should also prepare a small sample of non BrdU-labeled, EtOH-fixed cells for PI-only control and set aside a small number of BrdU-labeled cells for BrdU-only control.<br /> \n59.

Labeling and hybridizing - TIMING 1-3 d</strong></p> \n \n<p>In order to avoid the ambiguity inherent to generalized methods, this protocol is based specifically on NimbleGen products. During our earliest attempts to profile replication timing genome-wide, NimbleGen outperformed other platforms we tested and became our platform of choice. Others have successfully applied this method to additional platforms<sup>13,14</sup>, including deep sequencing of BrdU-IP DNA<sup>15</sup>. Currently, mammalian replication timing data generated from microarray hybridization and deep sequencing is of equal quality<sup>1, 3</sup>, while the microarray method remains more cost-effective and the bioinformatics are considerably less demanding for the typical laboratory. Future advances reducing BrdU-labeling times and sequencing limitations may make this method more worthwhile and accessible<sup>16</sup>.</p> \n \n<p>84. Differentially label reamplified early and late WGA DNA fractions with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes following the Sample Labeling Instructions for NimbleGen Dual-Color DNA Labeling Kit \\(cat. no. 05223547001). Briefly, 1 ug of early or late replicating DNA is labeled with either Cy5 or Cy3 random 7-mer dyes by Klenow reaction, precipitated with isopropanol, and resuspended in nuclease-free water and quantified.

Properties of RT switching domains.</strong> To compute domains that switch to earlier or later replication timing during development, we first subtract the normalized \\(not loess smoothed) values of the two experiments to be compared, then segment the resulting profile of timing changes as shown below:</p> \n \n<p>141| dRT = CNA\\(RT$NPCave-RT$ESCave, RT$CHR, RT$POSITION, data.type=\"logratio\", sampleid=  \"NPC-ESC dRT\")<br /> \n142| Seg.dRT = segment\\(dRT, nperm=10000, alpha=1e-15, undo.splits = \"sdundo\", undo.SD=1.5, verbose=2)<br /> \n143| dRTdom = Seg.dRT$output<br /> \n144| quantile\\(dRTdom$seg.mean, probs = c\\(0.05, 0.95)) # Top 5%<br /> \n145| quantile\\(dRTdom$seg.mean, probs = c\\(0.40, 0.60)) # Middle 20%<br /> \n146| LtoEdom = subset\\(dRTdom, dRTdom$seg.mean &gt; 1.28552) <br /> \n147| EtoLdom = subset\\(dRTdom, dRTdom$seg.mean &lt; -1.32328)<br /> \n148| middleDom = subset\\(dRTdom, dRTdom$seg.mean &gt; -0.14808 &amp;  dRTdom$seg.mean &lt; 0.23698)</p>",
    "<p><strong>7.) Assignment of replication timing values to gene promoters.</strong> The smoothed data object produced by loess is valuable for calculating timing \\(or other) values at a shared set of genomic coordinates, which is especially helpful for comparing datasets from different array platforms or assigning timing data to NCBI's RefSeq gene promoter locations \\( <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/</a>) as outlined below:</p> \n \n<p>149| chrs = levels\\(RefSeq$CHR) # List of chromosomes to be analyzed<br /> \n150| AllSm = NULL  # Store smoothed data for all chromosomes<br /> \n151| ChrSm = NULL # Store smoothed data for current chromosome<br /> \n152| for\\(chr in chrs) \\{<br /> \n153| RTc = subset\\(RT, CHR==chr)<br /> \n154| RSc = subset\\(RefSeq, CHR==chr)<br /> \n155| cat\\(\"Current chromosome: \", chr, \"\\n\")<br /> \n156| lspan = 300000/\\(max\\(RTc$POSITION)-min\\(RTc$POSITION)) <br /> \n157|  <br /> \n158| smLym1    = loess\\(RT$mLymphR1 ~ RT$POSITION, span = lspan)<br /> \n159| smLym2    = loess\\(RT$mLymphR2  ~ RT$POSITION, span = lspan) <br /> \n160| smLym3    = loess\\(RT$mLymphAve  ~ RT$POSITION, span = lspan)<br /> \n161| <br /> \n162| Lym1    = predict\\(smLym1, RSc$TSS) <br /> \n163| Lym2    = predict\\(smLym2, RSc$TSS)<br /> \n164| Lym3    = predict\\(smLym3, RSc$TSS)<br /> \n165| <br /> \n166| ChrSm = data.frame\\(CHR=chr,POSITION= RSc$TSS, Lym1, Lym2, Lym3)<br /> \n167| AllSm = rbind\\(AllSm, ChrSm)<br /> \n168| }<br /> \n169| write.table\\(AllSm, “Mouse lymphoblast RT at RefSeq gene positions.txt”, quote=F, sep=”\\t”)</p>",
    "<p><strong>8.) Assignment of histone and other epigenetic marks to gene promoters.</strong> Through the ENCODE project and other initiatives, a wide array of epigenetic datasets have been made, and similar data repositories. Just as timing can be assigned to gene promoters as outlined above, datasets from GEO \\( <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</a>) or the UCSC Genome Browser \\( <a href=\"http://genome.ucsc.edu/\">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</a>) can be assigned to any set of genomic loci, including gene promoters or the boundaries of replication domains.  Below is a generic method for assigning values from epigenetic mark datasets to promoter regions surrounding gene transcription start sites.  However, note that the specific methods of quantification should be informed by the biological properties of the marks to be quantified and the questions to be addressed.</p> \n \n<p>170| chrs = levels\\(Marks$CHR);  AllGenes = NULL;  AllHist = NULL<br /> \n171| for \\(chr in chrs) \\{<br /> \n172| RSc = subset\\(RefSeq, CHR==chr)    <br /> \n173| RTc = subset\\(Marks, CHR==chr)<br /> \n174| for\\(m in 1:nrow\\(RSc)) \\{<br /> \n175|  if\\(RSc\\[m,]$Strand==\"+\")  \\{<br /> \n176| RTcSub = subset\\(RTc, \\(RTc$Start &lt; RSc\\[m,]$txStart +500) &amp; \\(RTc$Start &gt; RSc\\[m,]$txStart - 2500))<br /> \n177|   AllHist = rbind\\(AllHist, apply\\(RTcSub, 2, max)\\[3:12])<br /> \n178|   AllGenes = rbind\\(AllGenes, RSc\\[m,]$Gene)<br /> \n179|  }<br /> \n180|  if\\(RSc\\[m,]$Strand==\"-\")  \\{<br /> \n181| RTcSub = subset\\(RTc, \\(RTc$Start &lt; RSc\\[m,]$txEnd +2500) &amp; \\(RTc$Start &gt; RSc\\[m,]$txEnd - 500))<br /> \n182|   AllHist = rbind\\(AllHist, apply\\(RTcSub, 2, max)\\[3:12])<br /> \n183|   AllGenes = rbind\\(AllGenes, RSc\\[m,]$Gene)<br /> \n184|<br /> \n185|       }<br /> \n186|   cat\\(\"Chromosome:\", chr, \"   Gene:\", m, \"/\", nrow\\(RSc), \"\\n\")<br /> \n187|   }<br /> \n188| }<br /> \n189| OutFile = data.frame\\(cbind\\(AllGenes, AllHist), stringsAsFactors=F)<br /> \n190| write.table\\(OutFile, file=\"Histone modifications at RefSeq gene<br /> \npositions.txt\", row.names=F, quote=F, sep=\"\\t\")</p>",
    "<p><strong>9.) Integration of epigenetic mark values over replication domains \\(density vs. timing)</strong> Given that the magnitude of correlations between genetic properties generally increases when measured in larger windows, it is important to quantify these relationships in windows consistent with biologically regulated unit sizes.
