    "Cell culture (Day 0)  For each condition, seed 100,000 RPE1 cells per well on 18 mm sterile glass coverslips in a 12-well plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Let the cells grow to confluency for two days. Cell culture (Day 2)  Replace the medium with DMEM without FBS to remove the available thymidine and to minimize the number of dividing cells. Incubate for 24 h. Local UV-C treatment, EdU incorporation, and fixation (Day 3)  Prepare a new 12-well plate with 1 mL of DMEM (without FBS), supplemented with 20 µM EdU and 1 µM FuDR (FuDR inhibits thymidine synthesis and maximizes EdU incorporation).Wash the cells with PBS.Rinse the 5 µm polycarbonate filters in PBS.Cover a tray (e.g., a 15 cm plate) with parafilm and transfer the coverslips (cells facing up) to the parafilm. Make sure different conditions stay separated.Drain excess PBS from the 5 µm filters and carefully place the filter on top of the coverslips. Duplicates or triplicates can be combined per filter; make sure to not move the filter after placing.Irradiate the cells through the filter with 30 J/m2. Note: To prevent drying of the coverslips, irradiate up to three covered sets of coverslips per run and keep the irradiation time as short as possible by reducing the distance to the lamp. Our UV lamp = 0.33 J/m2/s = 91 s for 30 J/m2.  Carefully add PBS on top of the filter to slightly lift it from the coverslips and remove the filter with tweezers.Drain the excess PBS from the coverslips, place the coverslips in the prepared 12-well plate with 20 µM EdU and 1 µM FuDR, and incubate for 1 h at 37°C.",
    "Note: A longer incubation up to 4 h may be helpful to assess potential residual repair activity in (partially) NER-deficient cells (Apelt et al., 2021).  Wash the cells with DMEM (without FBS) and incubate with DMEM (without FBS) supplemented with 10 µM thymidine for 15 minutes at 37°C, to dilute the non-incorporated EdU.Wash with PBS and fix the cells in 3.7% formaldehyde (diluted in PBS) for 15 min at RT.Wash the coverslips twice with PBS and store in PBS at 4°C until click reaction and staining. Note: Coverslips are stable at 4°C. However, continuation with fluorescent EdU labeling and CPD staining is recommended within approximately one week.   Fluorescent labeling of incorporated EdU by Click-iT chemistry (preferably within one week after fixation in step C)  Remove PBS from the coverslips.Permeabilize the cells with 0.5% Triton-X100 in PBS for 20 min at RT.Wash twice for 5 min with 3% BSA in PBS.Wash once with PBS.Prepare 100 µL of click reaction mix per coverslip (see Recipes).Place 100 µL droplets of the click reaction mix on parafilm, place the coverslips (cells facing down) on the droplets, and incubate for 30 min at RT in the dark.Place the coverslips back in the 12-well plate (cells facing up).Wash with PBS. Keep the coverslips in the dark during the subsequent steps of the protocol. Note: Continue immediately with antibody-mediated labeling of remaining CPDs to detect sites of local damage.   Antibody-mediated detection of remaining CPDs  Fix cells again in 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at RT to prevent any loss of Click-iT signal.Wash twice with PBS.Block unreacted aldehydes with 100 mM glycine in PBS for 10 min at RT.Wash with PBS.Denature the DNA with 0.5 M NaOH in PBS for 5 min at RT (the CPD antibody only recognizes CPDs in a single-stranded DNA configuration).",
    "Wash three times with PBS.Block with 10% BSA in PBS for 15 min at RT.Wash with PBS.Equilibrate with WB (see Recipes).Place the coverslips on parafilm (cells facing up), add 100 µL per coverslip of the primary CPD antibody (diluted 1/1,000 in WB), and incubate for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4°C.Remove the antibody and wash the coverslips while on parafilm four times for 5 min with WB.Add 100 µL per coverslip of the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse Alexa 555) diluted 1/1,000 in WB and incubate for 1 h at RT.Wash once for 5 min in WB.Add 100 µL per coverslip of DAPI diluted to 1 ug/mL (typically 1/1,000) in WB and incubate for 5 min at RT.Wash twice for 5 min with PBS.Mount the coverslips (cells facing down) in aqua poly/mount on glass microscopy slides marked for each condition.Let dry horizontally overnight at RT.Image the slides with a fluorescence microscope using 63× magnification and store images in Carl Zeiss Image Data Format (.czi files)."
