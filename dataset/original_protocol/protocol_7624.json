    "Label cells with EdU For the preparation of mESC medium and culture and expansion of mESCs and NIH3T3, please refer to our publication (Zhang et al., 2023). Before EdU labeling, incubate cells with 37 °C pre-warmed fresh mESCs medium for 2 h, with 25 mL of medium for each 15 cm diameter dish containing ~1.5 × 107 cells.To perform EdU labeling, take the dishes to a biological safety cabinet, add 25 μL of EdU stock (10 mM) into 25 mL of pre-existing medium for each dish, and mix well gently to make sure that the final concentration of EdU is 10 μM. Depending on the percentage of mESCs in S phase (more than 60%), we calculated that at least 9 × 109 cells in each dish were labeled by EdU.Put the dishes back into the incubator quickly and label for 10 min.Note: Typically, fork-associated RNA components display a low-dose manner. To improve the productivity, using a cell line with high percentage of S-phase cells is critical to secure the RNA output. In our study, we used mESCs, as these always keep more than 60% of cells in S phase. If you need to evaluate replication stress dynamics, add genotoxic drugs such as 4 mM hydroxyurea (HU) into the dish and incubate for 2 h. To get post-replicated chromatin samples, remove EdU-positive medium, carefully wash cells three times with 5 mL each time of pre-warmed chase medium. Chase medium, containing 10 μM thymidine, is used to compete with EdU to chase DNA replication. After 1 h incubation, the EdU-labeled DNA has been constructed to mature chromatin. So, this group is used as a chromatin control. Then, add 25 mL of pre-warmed chase medium and incubate for 1 h.",
    "Formaldehyde crosslink and harvest cells Once finished with EdU labeling, thymidine chase, or drugs treatment, remove culture medium quickly and add 10 mL of ice-cold PBS containing 1% formaldehyde to each dish to fix cells for 20 min at room temperature.Caution:  Formaldehyde is toxic to human health.Critical:  Do not wash cells with PBS buffer before fixation since PBS washing may cause RNA degradation.Add 1 mL of 1.25 M glycine to each dish to quench formaldehyde.Scrape cells and harvest into 50 mL RNase-free centrifuge tubes. Record the fixation volume.Critical:  Keep tubes on ice all the time.Spin down at 900× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove supernatant.Use ice-cold 1× PBS buffer containing 10 U/μL RNase inhibitor to wash sediments three times with the same volume as the fixation volume from step B3.Pause point:  Samples can be quickly immersed into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for at least four weeks.Cell permeabilization Resuspend cells in ice-cold permeabilization buffer containing 10 U/μL RNase inhibitor. Adjust cell density to 1 × 107 cells/mL. Vortex well and incubate at room temperature for 30 min on a shaker (40 rpm).Centrifuge at 900× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove supernatant.Wash cells with ice-cold 1× PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 10 U/μL RNase inhibitor; the volume used is equal to the permeabilization buffer in step C1.Centrifuge at 900× g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove supernatant.Repeat steps C4 and C5 once. Keep samples on ice for click reaction.Click reaction Prepare click reaction cocktail as listed in Table 1.Table 1. Click reaction cocktail (5 mL for 1 × 108 cells) table:",

    "Critical:  The biotin-azide is sensitive to light. The reaction cocktail should be stored in the dark.Critical:  CuII is unstable in water. The reaction cocktail should be prepared fresh.Resuspend cells into click reaction cocktail. Adjust reaction volume to reach the density of 1 × 108 cells per 5 mL.Vortex gently and incubate for 2 h at room temperature on a shaker (40 rpm).Critical:  Keep the reaction tubes in the dark.Centrifuge at 900× g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove supernatant.Wash cells with ice-cold 1× PBS buffer containing 0.5% BSA and 10 U/μL RNase inhibitor. The PBS volume used is equal to the permeabilization buffer in step C1.Centrifuge at 900× g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove supernatant.Repeat steps D5 and D6 once.Cell lysis and sonication Keep lysis buffer on ice. Add leupeptin, aprotinin, and RNase inhibitor before use.Add 100 μL of lysis buffer per 1.5 × 107 cells and resuspend well. Transfer cell suspension into a 1.5 mL RNase-free centrifuge tube.Sonicate cells using a microtip sonicator with the following settings: pulse, 20 s; 40 s pause; 15 cycles; power: 13–16 watts.Critical:  Tubes should be immersed into an ice-cold water bath in the process of sonication to prevent overheating.Note: After sonication, the supernatant should be clear, but not cloudy. Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant through a 90 µm nylon mesh and collect into a new 1.5 mL RNase-free centrifuge tube; then, keep samples on ice.Note: To examine DNA fragment size at this step, pick up 5 μL of supernatant to extract DNA. Perform electrophoresis using 1% agarose gel at 120 V for 30 min to detect DNA fragments (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4869/bioprotoc-13-21-4869-g001.jpgFigure 1. DNA fragments after sonication. The size of DNA fragments is mainly concentrated in the 200–1,000 base pair range.",
    "DNA extraction.Take 5 μL from the supernatant from step E5, add protease K to the final concentration of 50–100 μg/mL, mix well, and incubate at 50 °C for 3 h.Add an equal volume of chloroform/isopropyl alcohol (volume ratio: 24:1), mix well, centrifuge at 10,000× g for 10 min, and transfer the supernatant to the new centrifuge tube.Add 10% volume of 10 M ammonium acetate and mix gently.Add twice the volume of isopropyl alcohol and mix gently.Centrifuge at 10,000× g for 10 min and discard supernatant.Add the same volume of 75% ethanol and mix well, centrifuge at 10,000× g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.Air-dry pellets for 5 min and dissolve with 10 μL of double-distilled water for electrophoresis.Dilute the samples with the same volume of ice-cold PBS to improve the efficiency of following Biotin capture. Make sure to add 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL aprotinin, and 10 U/μL RNase inhibitor.Pick up 15 μL of each sample, mix well with 15 μL of 2× SB, and boil at 95 °C for 10 min. These samples can be used as input for immunoblotting targeting replication fork proteins such as PCNA.Critical:  This step is crucial since immunoblotting of PCNA can be used to confirm the pull-down efficiency and specificity.Pick up 15 μL of each sample, mix well with 500 μL of TRIzol, and store at -80 °C for RNA purification.Critical:  This step is crucial; samples will be used to calculate enrichment fold change in the following qPCR confirmation.Streptavidin capture Vortex streptavidin agarose beads well.Calculate agarose beads volume for each sample. Typically, 100 μL of streptavidin agarose beads is used per 1 × 108 cells.Wash streptavidin agarose beads two times with lysis buffer and one time with PBS before use, using 1 mL for each wash.",
    "Add beads into each sample and incubate for 16 h at 4 °C on a rotator (40 rpm).Critical:  Keep the rotator in the dark.Centrifuge at 1,800× g for 1 min at 4 °C and remove supernatant.Wash beads three times with ice-cold lysis buffer and one time with 1 mL of salt wash buffer. For each wash, samples should be rotated for 5 min before centrifugation.Elution of proteins and RNAs Separate the beads of each sample into two parts equally to elution protein and RNA components, respectively.Add 2 μL of 2× SB into one part, mix well, and boil samples at 95 °C for 25 min to elute proteins. These are ready to use for immunoblotting.For elution of RNAs, add 500 μL of TRIzol into another part of each sample, and mix well.Add 100 μL of chloroform into each tube, vortex tightly for 30 s, and leave on ice for 5 min.Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant of each sample into a new RNase-free tube and record the volume.Add an equal volume of isopropanol and leave on ice for 10 min.Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant.Wash the pellet with 75% alcohol.Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C.

Approximately 200–400 ng of RNA can be extracted from 1× 108 cells.Note: RNA purification is critically important; the optical density (OD) 260/230 value should be between 1.5 and 2.4, and the OD260/280 value must be between 1.8 and 2.4."
