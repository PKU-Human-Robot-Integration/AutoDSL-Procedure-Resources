    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparing the mice for removal of the aortae\nTiming: 30 min\nThese steps describe the preparation of the aortae to achieve a high quality X-Gal staining.\nEuthanize the mice by placing them into a cage that is slowly filled with CO2. Wait until no more breathing could be observed. Go on with further procedure only after death has been confirmed reliably.\nNote: Alternatively, mice could also be euthanized using inhaled anesthetics (Isoflurane, for example: Inhalation of 5.0 relative vol. % in an anesthesia chamber at an oxygen flow of 1 l/min) combined with blood deprivation or intraperitoneally injected anesthetics (Ketamine / Xylacine) combined with blood deprivation.\nCAUTION: Use of anesthetic must be approved by the appropriate institutional authorities.\nCut the chest open and expose the chest cavity.\nPerfuse the animal with 1×PBS through the left ventricle until the liver appears to be whitish.\nFix the aortae in situ by slowly perfusing the mouse with 10 mL of the fixative solution. If a perfuser is used: perfuse at 60 mL/h for 10 min.",
    "Note: The composition of the fixative solution depends on further processing: For X-Gal staining of whole mounts or cryosections the fixative contains 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde (in PBS) as this combination has proven to yield excellent fixation of a wide variety of tissues. However, the standard fixative for perfusion fixation, which is 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, could also be used and we assume that this will not have a significant negative effect on the X-Gal staining outcome. Other fixatives like osmium tetroxide, mercuric chloride-based fixatives, precipitating fixatives Oethanol, methanol and acetone) or diimidoester fixation have not been used in our laboratory and are therefore not recommended using this protocol. The fixative solution can be stored at 4°C for a maximum of 4 weeks.\nDissection and staining of the aorta\nTiming: 2 days\nHere, we describe the process of the X-Gal staining and its quantification.\nRemove internal organs as well as the lungs, trachea and esophagus. Only the heart with its attached vessels should be left now.\nCut ascending vessels, below the pharynx.\nGrab the heart with forceps and lift it carefully to set the aorta under some tension.\nCut along the spine towards the tail.\nNote: Avoid rupture of the aorta during dissection. It is very difficult to find its loose end in the body.\nTransfer the excised aorta (still attached to the heart) into a 10-cm Petri dish with PBS and remove the heart by carefully cutting the left ventricle in 5 mm distance around the aortic valve.\nTransfer aorta into a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube with 1 mL of fixative solution.\nPostfix tissues for 30 min at RT with gentle shaking.\nWash fixed tissues three times for 5 min with PBS at RT with gentle shaking and process immediately for further analysis.",
    "lncubate fixed aorta in 1.5 mL of X-Gal staining solution overnight in the dark at RT with gentle shaking.\nNote: X-Gal stock solution (40 mg/mL) should be stored as 1 mL aliquots at −20°C. The staining solution should be stored in the dark at RT. Before use, X-Gal stock solution should be added to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL of X-Gal. Depending on the amount of tissue to be stained, 2–20 mL of X-Gal staining solution per mouse need to be prepared.\nWash tissues three times for 5 min with PBS at RT with gentle shaking.\nTake photos under a dissection microscope or stereo-microscope.\nMeasure LacZ positive (blue) area using ImageJ (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1928-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Quantification of LacZ+ area within plaque area\nWhole aortic area and blue area within the aorta is measured with an image analysis program like ImageJ. Here is an example of the accumulation of LacZ expressing CD11c+ cells within the atherosclerotic lesions with time in high cholesterol fed ApoE−/− mice. Data are the mean +/- SD. ∗p<0.05\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1928-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Examples of X-Gal-stained aortae macroscopically as well as microscopically (scale bar: 50 μm) containing plaques with LacZ expressing CD11c+ cells\nNote: Optionally, aortae can be paraffin embedded, cut with a microtome and analyzed microscopically (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and section “quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]”). Then, quantification can also be performed with the paraffin sections using ImageJ (analysis of pixels per mm2).Co-stainings using immunohistochemistry can be performed to further characterize the LacZ positive cells."
