    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCulturing yeast cells for single-molecule imaging\nTiming: 4 days\nFor single-molecule imaging experiments, we need to revive the cells from the −80°C freezer, grow them to the log phase in SC media, and label the -HaloTag protein with HTL. Follow these steps for the same.\nFour days before imaging, streak yeast cells (from −80°C freezer) onto a SC+Agar plate to get single colonies. Incubate the plate at 30°C for 2 days.\nOne day before imaging, inoculate a single colony in 3 mL SC broth (in 14 mL Falcon tube). Grow cells at 30°C at 230 RPM for 20–24 h for saturated growth.\nOn the day of imaging, inoculate 50 μL of this saturated culture into a fresh 3 mL of SC media (in 14 mL Falcon tube). Grow cells at 30°C at 230 RPM for 4–5 h to bring them to the log phase of growth.\nOptional: If you want to give any treatment (e.g., auxin/rapamycin induction for protein depletion, induction for protein expression, etc.), add the inducer after 4 h of growth, keep it for shaking for another 1–2 h (depending on your experimental need) and then proceed.\nAfter 5 h growth, centrifuge 3 mL culture to pellet down the cells ( ∼ 541 × g for 1 min). Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of fresh prewarmed SC media.\nAdd fluorescently labeled HTL. Please refer to the note below for the selection of the HTL and its concentration.\nCritical: Make sure the suitable laser and filter are available on your microscope before ordering HTL.",
    "Note: For single-molecule tracking, we need sparse labeling of the protein molecules so that their individual trajectories can be observed. Generally, we recommend labeling 3 to 5 molecules of protein per nucleus or 5–8 molecules of protein per cell. Such a low labeling density can be achieved by using an extremely low concentration of the HTL (Generally, JF646, JF552, JF549 or TMR work best with yeast). The labeling efficiency depends on the intracellular/intranuclear concentration of that protein. E.g., histone H3 (Hht1) is present in high abundance, so 0.005 nM JF646-HTL is enough to label 3 to 5 molecules per nucleus, whereas aurora kinase B (Ipl1) is present in low abundance, so 15 nM JF646-HTL is required to label 3 to 5 molecules per nucleus.\nShake the culture for an additional 30 min after adding the HTL at 30°C at 230 RPM.\nCentrifuge the culture (541 × g for 1 min) to pellet down the cells. Discard the supernatant gently.\nWash the cells twice or thrice with prewarmed SC media (1 mL each wash, 541 × g for 1 min) to remove unbound dye.\nResuspend the cells in the remaining 10–20 μL of media. Take 3 μL of this cell suspension for imaging.\nNote: We have observed an inverse relationship between the emission wavelength of the HaloTag ligand and cell permeability.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] The ligand with the higher emission wavelength (JF646) labels the HaloTag protein to the same extent at 100–1,000 times less concentration than the ligand with the shorter emission wavelength (JF549/TMR). Generally, the HaloTag ligands with a green fluorophore (JF503-HTL or JF525-HTL) fail to label the HaloTag proteins in yeast (Unpublished observation). Recently, Zheng et al. reported a similar observation that JF552-HTL show improved cell-permeability compared to JF549-HTL.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nNote: JF552 is more photostable with better signal-to-noise than JF646.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]",
    "Single-molecule imaging under the inverted microscope\nTiming: 1–4 Day(s)\nFor acquiring time-lapse single-molecule movies, live cells are placed under the nutrient agarose pad (8 mm × 8 mm) in a LabTekII chamber for a continuous supply of nutrients and to keep the cells in a monolayer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Cells are focused under the Highly Inclined and Laminated Optical (HILO) sheet microscope and time-lapse movies are acquired with below mentioned parameters.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2238-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. How to mount cells under the agarose pad for imaging\n(A) LabTekII Imaging chamber with 3 μL of cell suspension.\n(B) Agarose pad in petri dish, a piece of 8 × 8 mm has been removed using surgical blade.\n(C) Agarose pad (8 × 8 mm) placed on the top of the cell suspension.\nFor making agarose pad, add 250 mg of SeaKem GTG Agarose to 25 mL of SC media in a 100 mL flask. Boil it in a microwave until all the agarose particles dissolve. Mix well and boil again. Pour exactly 15 mL media into a 100 mm Petri dish and let it solidify (∼20 min). Keep the lid of the petri dish open for 20 min to remove excess moisture. Prepare the agarose pad freshly (just before 1–2 h of imaging).",
    "Critical: For single-molecule tracking, three different imaging strategies can be used depending on which biophysical parameters need to be quantified: 1) Continuous acquisition mode: this mode is used to quantify diffusion parameters of a protein of interest, such as mean-squared displacement (MSD), diffusion coefficient (D), the fraction of bound and unbound molecules, target-search mechanism. For this mode, images are acquired with 10–30 ms exposure time and 0 ms time interval.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] Due to continuous acquisition, the photobleaching is faster and these movies are not good for estimation of the residence time, as the residence time is curtailed due to photobleaching. 2) Long-time interval imaging: to reduce the photobleaching, this mode is used in which images are acquired with 10–30 ms exposure time and 200 ms or 500 ms or 750 ms or 1,000 ms time interval.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This mode allows long-term imaging of the bound molecules, and it reduces photobleaching, so the bound molecules can be observed for a longer time. However, such movies shouldn’t be used for quantifying the diffusion parameters, as the imaging time interval is beyond the resolution of the diffusion parameters. 3) Long time interval, long exposure imaging: It has been observed that imaging with a long exposure time requires low laser power and it only captures the bound molecules. Due to the long exposure time, fast-moving molecules will not be captured because of motion blur.14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14],15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] So, this mode of imaging is good for estimating residence time, but not good for the diffusion parameters. Hence, before imaging, decide what biophysical parameters you want to extract and select the best imaging strategy.\nTurn on the microscope software and hardware (camera, light source, lasers).\nTurn on the stage incubator at 30°C and leave it on for 30 min before imaging for temperature stabilization.",
    "Take LabTek II chamber with 1.5 mm cover glass.\nPut 3 μL of cell suspension from step no. 10 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCut 8 mm × 8 mm agarose slab from the Petri dish using a surgical blade.\nPut this agarose slab upside down on top of the cell suspension (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nGently press it with a finger or the back of a pipette tip to spread the cells evenly under the agarose pad and to arrange them in monolayer.\nClose the lid of the LabTek II chamber.\nFocus on the cells under the microscope using a 100× 1.49 NA oil objective lens, in transmitted light mode.\nFind out the best field for imaging.\nNote: Generally, we choose a field in which we get ∼10–20 cells in monolayer in the displayed image on the computer screen (not in the eyepiece, because the eyepiece has a bigger field of view than the camera).\nAfter focusing, switch the transmitted light mode to fluorescence mode/reflected light mode.\nSwitch on the 488 laser to focus on the intracellular structure/protein labeled with GFP (e.g., nucleus/spindle/transcription site etc).\nCritical: Work quickly to focus on the structure with minimum exposure/laser power to avoid photobleaching/phototoxicity.\nSet acquisition parameters in the imaging software as follows:\nExcitation power: Start with 100 μW 488 nm laser, 1 mW 647 nm laser.\nAdjust the power of the 488 nm laser such that the GFP-labelled protein/structure is clearly visible in the single-focal plane (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nAdjust the power of the 647 nm laser such that the single molecules of the -HaloTag protein are visible (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2238-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A field view of cells under GFP and 647 channels (single-focal plane images)",
    "Select a field with ∼10–20 cell per image. Adjust the 488-laser power in such a way that the entire nucleus is visible in a single-focal plane. Adjust the 647laser power such that the single-molecules of Hht1 are visible with signal to noise ratio of at-least 5:1. Higher the laser power, faster the photobleaching. If residence time estimation is required, try not to bleach the single-molecules faster due to high laser power. Representative images have been shown with adequate labeling density, over labeling density and under labeling density. Yellow arrows show specific cells with over labeling and red arrows show specific cells with under labeling. Scale bar: 2 μm.\nNote: Try to optimize the laser power so that the single-molecules are visible with sufficient signal to noise ratio (∼5:1) for automated detection, however, they should not be too bright as that will lead to fast photobleaching. While imaging with long exposure time, the laser power should be reduced proportionally.\nExposure time:\nGenerally, 10–30 ms exposure time is recommended for quantifying the diffusion parameters (such as MSD, diffusion coefficient, a fraction of bound and unbound molecules, and target-search mechanism).\nFor quantifying residence time, the use of a higher exposure time (∼200–500 ms) with low laser power is recommended to capture only the bound molecules.15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15],16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] The fast-moving molecules will be blurred out in these images.\nZ-stack: Generally, single-molecule tracking is performed from a single-focal plane time-lapse movie due to technical limitations, such as fast photobleaching of the single fluorophores and reduced speed of imaging. So, a z-stack is not mandatory. However, there are reports on single-molecule tracking in 3D.17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17],18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]\nTime interval between frames: For single-molecule tracking, the images are acquired at different time intervals to extract different parameters.",
    "Movies with continuous acquisition (10–30 ms exposure, 0 ms time lapse) are used to extract the diffusion parameters. However, continuous acquisition bleaches the fluorophores faster, so these movies are not good for quantifying the residence time because the residence time is curtailed due to photobleaching.\nFor estimating the residence time, movies are acquired with a longer time-lapse. Generally, 100 ms, 200 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000 ms time intervals are recommended for yeast cells, as the movies collected with higher than 1,000 ms time intervals show cell movement and distortion of the tracks.\nNumber of frames:\nFor continuous acquisition mode (10–30 ms exposure, 0 min time interval), it is recommended to capture ∼1,000–2,000 frames (until you see a negligible number of single molecules).\nFor long time-lapse imaging (i.e., time interval 200 ms, 500 ms, 750 ms, 1,000 ms), acquire ∼200–400 frames (until you see a negligible number of single molecules).\nWith this set of imaging parameters, acquire enough movies to get at least 1,000 tracks per strain or per condition.\nNote: We generally have an imaging session of 4–5 h per day to collect 20 movies of each 0 ms time interval (1,000 frames), 200 ms time interval (200 frames), and 1,000 ms time interval (100 frames). We need ∼30 to 50 movies to get 1,000 tracks. So, 2–3 days of imaging (4–5 h daily) is required to complete one experiment (condition).\nCritical: Do not image the cells from the same agarose pad for longer than 1 h to avoid the artifact caused by phototoxicity. Also, the cellular dynamics and growth rate may change/slow down under the agarose pad or after several irradiations. So, take freshly growing cells and place a new agarose pad in the LabTekII chamber at every 1 h to acquire more movies.",
