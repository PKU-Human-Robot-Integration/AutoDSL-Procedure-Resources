    "1. Making and sterilizing a medium for growing yeast\nMake 180 mL of a complete yeast extract with bactopeptone (YP) medium. The complete YP medium contains 1% (w/v) yeast extract and 2% (w/v) bactopeptone.\nDistribute 180 mL of the YP medium equally into four 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Each of these flasks contains 45 mL of the YP medium.\nSterilize the flasks with YP medium by autoclaving at 15 psi/121 °C for 45 min.\n2. Wild-type yeast strain\nUse the BY4742 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) strain.\n3. Growing yeast in the YP medium containing 2% glucose\nSterilize a 20% (w/v) stock solution of glucose by autoclaving at 15 psi/121 °C for 45 min.\nAdd 5 mL of the autoclaved 20% (w/v) stock solution of glucose to each of the two Erlenmeyer flasks with 45 mL of the sterilized YP medium. The final concentration glucose in the YP medium is 2% (w/v).\nUse a microbiological loop to inoculate yeast cells into each of the two Erlenmeyer flasks with the YP medium containing 2% glucose.\nGrow the yeast cells overnight at 30 °C in a rotational shaker set at 200 rpm.\nTake an aliquot of yeast culture. Determine the total number of yeast cells per mL of culture. Count cells using a hemocytometer.\n4. Cell transfer to and cell grows in the YP medium with 2% glucose\nAdd 5 mL of the sterilized 20% (w/v) stock solution of glucose to each of the remaining two Erlenmeyer flasks with the autoclaved YP medium. The final concentration of glucose is 2% (w/v).",
    "Transfer a volume of the overnight yeast culture in YP medium with 2% glucose that contains the total number of 5.0 x 107 cells into each of the two Erlenmeyer flasks with the YP medium containing 2% glucose. Use a sterile pipette for the cell transfer.\nGrow the yeast cells for at least 24 h (or more, if the experiment requires) at 30 °C in a rotational shaker set at 200 rpm.\n5. Making reagents, preparing labware, and setting up equipment for cell quenching\nPrepare the following: 1) a quenching solution (60% high-grade (>99.9%) methanol in 155 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) buffer, pH = 8.0); 2) an ice-cold ABC solution (pH = 8.0); 3) a digital thermometer capable of measuring up to -20 °C; 4) 500 mL large centrifuge bottles; 5) a pre-cooled high-speed centrifuge with a pre-cooled rotor and pre-cooled 500 mL centrifuge bottles for this rotor, all at -5 °C; 6) metabolite extraction tubes (15 mL high-speed glass centrifuge tubes with polytetrafluoroethylene lined caps); and 7) dry ice.\n6. Cell quenching\nUse a hemocytometer to determine the number of yeast cells per mL of YP with 2% glucose culture.\nTransfer a volume of the culture in YP medium with 2% glucose that contains the total number of 5.0 x 108 cells into pre-cooled 500 mL centrifuge bottles.\nQuickly fill the centrifuge bottle containing the cells up to the volume of 200 mL with a quenching solution stored at -20 °C.\nCentrifuge the bottles in a high-speed centrifuge at 11,325 x g for 3 min at -5 °C.\nQuickly and tenderly recover the bottle from the centrifuge; gently unscrew the lid and remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.",
    "Quickly resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of ice-cold ABC buffer and transfer the suspension into a 15 mL high-speed glass centrifuge tube with a polytetrafluoroethylene-lined cap for metabolite extraction.\nCollect cells by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 3 min at 0 °C.\nQuickly remove the supernatant and place the tube on dry ice to begin metabolite extraction or store the tube at -80 °C until extraction.\n7. Preparation of reagents, labware and equipment for metabolite extraction\nPrepare the following: 1) LC-MS grade chloroform; 2) LC-MS grade methanol; 3) LC grade nano-pure water; 4) LC-MS grade (ACN); 5) glass beads (acid-washed, 425-600 µm); 6) a vortex with a foam tube holder kit with retainer; 7) 15 mL high-speed glass centrifuge tubes with polytetrafluoroethylene-lined caps; 8) MS vials; 9) dry ice; and 10) 1.5 mL tubes washed once with ethanol, once with ACN and once with nano-pure water.\n\t​NOTE: Use only micropipette tips and tubes made of polypropylene that is resistant to organic solvents.\n8. Metabolite extraction\nTo the metabolites kept on dry ice or stored at -80 °C tube from step 6.7, add the following: 1) 2 mL of chloroform stored at -20 °C; 2) 1 mL of methanol stored at -20 °C; 3) 1 mL of ice-cold nano-pure water; and 4) 200 µL of 425-600 µm acid-washed glass beads.\nCover and close the mouth of a tube with aluminum foil. Place tubes in a foam tube holder kit with retainer and vortex them for 30 min at medium speed (i.e., at a speed that is set at 6, with 12 being the maximum speed of a vortex) at 4 °C to facilitate metabolite extraction.",
    "Incubate the tube for 15 min on ice (NOT dry ice!) to promote protein precipitation and the separation of the upper aqueous from the lower organic phase.\nCentrifuge the tube in a clinical centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. This centrifugation step allows separating the upper aqueous phase (which contains water-soluble metabolites) from the middle layer (which contains cell debris and proteins) and from the lower organic phase (which contains mostly lipids).\nUse a micropipette to transfer the upper aqueous phase (400 µL) to a washed and labeled 1.5 mL tube containing 800 µL of ACN that was stored at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: There will be white cloud precipitation after adding the upper aqueous phase to ACN kept at -20 °C.\nCentrifuge the tube with the sample in a tabletop centrifuge at 13,400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\n\t​NOTE: The white cloud precipitation will disappear after centrifugation.\nTransfer 800 µL from the upper portion of a liquid in the tube to a labeled MS vial. Store the sample at 0 °C until it is analyzed by LC-MS/MS.\n9. Preparation of reagents, labware, and equipment for LC\nPrepare the following: 1) a vortex; 2) an ultrasonic sonicator; 3) MS glass vials; 4) an LC system equipped with a binary pump, degasser, and autosampler; 5) a zwitterionic-phase chromatography column (5 µm polymer, 150 x 2.1 mm) named in Table of Materials; 6) a column heater; and 7) mobile phases, including phase A (5:95 ACN:water (v/v) with 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH = 8.0) and phase B (100% ACN).\n10. Separation of extracted metabolites by LC\nSubject the content of the MS vial to ultrasonic sonication for 15 min.\nVortex the MS vial 3x for 10 sec at room temperature (RT).",
    "Place the MS vial into the well plate.\nDuring chromatograph, maintain the column at 45 °C and a flow rate of 0.250 mL/min. Keep the sample in the well plate at 0 °C. Refer to Table 1 for the LC gradients that need to be used during chromatography.\n\tNOTE: A representative total ion chromatogram of water-soluble metabolites that were extracted from cells of the wild-type strain BY4742 is shown in Figure 1. The metabolites separated by LC were identified and quantified by mass spectrometric analysis that was performed in positive ionization [ESI (+)] mode, as described for step 11.\n11. Mass spectrometric analysis of metabolites separated by LC\nUse a mass spectrometer equipped with heated electrospray ionization (HESI) for the identification and quantitation of water-soluble metabolites that were separated by LC. Use the mass spectrometer's analyzer for MS1 ions and the mass spectrometer's detector for MS2 ions. Use the settings provided in Table 2 and Table 3 for the data-dependent acquisition of MS1 and MS2 ions, respectively.\nUse a sample volume of 10 µL for the injection in both the ESI (+) and ESI (-) modes.\n12. Identification and quantitation of different metabolites by the processing of raw data from LC-MS/MS\nUse the software named in Table of Materials to conduct the identification and quantitation of different water-soluble metabolites from raw LC-MS/MS files. This software uses MS1 for metabolite quantitation and MS2 for metabolite identification. The software exploits the most extensively curated mass spectral fragmentation library to annotate the metabolites using the LC-MS/MS raw data by matching MS spectra. This software also uses the exact mass of MS1 and isotope pattern match to annotate metabolites using online databases. See Figure 2 for details.",
    "Use the library of databases and spectra, which is freely available online (https://www.mzcloud.org), to search for MS2 spectra of the raw data.\n13. Membrane integrity assay by propidium Iodide (PI) staining and fluorescence microscopy\nAfter cell quenching performed as described for step 6, wash the quenched cells thoroughly with 15 mL of ABC buffer to remove the quenching solution. Collect cells by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 5 min at 0 °C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of ABC buffer and add 0.5 mL of the PI solution (0.5 mg/mL).\nVortex a tube with the sample 3x for 10 s and incubate it for 10 min in the dark and on ice.\nCentrifuge the tube with the sample in a tabletop centrifuge at 13,400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of ABC buffer.\nCentrifuge the tube at 13,400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant. Repeat this step 2 more times to remove the PI bound to the cell surface.\nResuspend the pellet in 300 µL of ABC buffer. Place 10 µL of the suspension on the surface of a microscope slide.\nCapture the differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy images with a fluorescence microscope. Use a filter set up at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 593 nm and 636 nm (respectively).\nUse a software to count the total cell number (in the DIC mode) and the number of fluorescently stained cells. Also, use this software to determine the intensity of staining for individual cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
