    "All participants were briefed about the procedures and signed a consent form prior to study initiation. The McMaster University Health Sciences and St. Joseph’s Healthcare Research Ethics Boards approved all procedures.\nNote: In this protocol, 47 right-handed females between the ages of 16 and 24 years are used. Of which, 15 participants suffer from MDD (physician-confirmed diagnosis) and are experiencing a depressive episode at the time of the study. This group of individuals is denoted as the “MDD group”. The at-risk group in this protocol consists of 16 participants who have a first degree relative (parent or sibling) with a diagnosis of MDD, but diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and are not currently depressed. The control group in this protocol consists of 16 participants who do not have first-degree relatives with depression, have no lifetime diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder and are not currently depressed.\n1. Participants Selection\nRecruit healthy control and at-risk female participants through the internet and print advertisements in the local community, and through the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience and Behavior at the local university. Recruit depressed participants through the Mood Disorders Clinic at the local hospital.\n\tNOTE: Qualifying patients are eligible to participate if they are female and have been diagnosed with a primary mood disorder according to DSM-IV criteria27, and have clinically significant standardized cut-off scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-Version II (BDI-II) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) questionnaires, as determined by completion of these measures upon arrival.",
    "Conduct initial phone or in-person interviews with interested participants to establish eligibility. Exclude participants that do not meet scanner safety requirements, or eligibility criteria for the MDD, at-risk or control groups, and all participants with a current or past history of psychosis, mania or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Additionally, exclude participants who have experienced a head injury leading to unconsciousness, or have had previous treatment with electroconvulsive therapy or transcranial magnetic stimulation.\nInvite the selected group of individuals for extensive testing, and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan using the following parameters [3T, T1-weighted SPGR axial acquisition with: 132 - 160 slices (1 mm thick). fMRI scan, 8-channel head coil, 31 axial slices (4 mm thick, no gap), TR/TE = 2,500/35 msec, FOV = 24 cm, matrix = 64 x 64, flip angle 90°].\nNOTE: Exclude participants with GAD as it is anticipated that they might experience higher levels of anxiety during the MRI scanning portion of the study, interfering with concentration and task compliance.\nScan the participants during the first 12 days of their menstrual cycles (follicular phase) to reduce the potential influences of hormonal fluctuations.\n2. Build Thought Suppression Task\nBuild a modified version of the suppression paradigm described by Mitchell and colleagues18, that will be viewed by the participants in the scanner. The paradigm consists of 4 blocks, each marked by a newly presented screen.\nUse psychology paradigm building software to program the paradigm. Using the software, assemble text and image slides to be presented serially, with responses collected with millisecond timing. The first block presents a target statement on the screen for 12.5 sec. Format the paradigm so that a 3-color traffic signal is present on the left hand side of all subsequent screens.",
    "Configure the paradigm to present a red traffic light signal for 30 sec on the following screen. Program the paradigm to present a green traffic signal for 30 sec on the next screen presented.\n\t\nConfigure the final screen to present a flashing yellow light. Flash the light four times at pseudorandom intervals between 1,500 - 2,500 msec apart. Repeat this series of screens 12 times.\nInsert the target statements into the paradigm during the participants visit, and therefore construct the paradigm in a way that makes it easily modifiable. During the participants visit, instruct the participants to suppress the target thought when the red light is presented, to free think when the green light is presented, and to press the response button each time the yellow light flashes. Completing this task in the MRI scanner will allow the assessment of neural activity difference during each instructed task.\n3. Participant Visit\nUpon arrival, assess depression severity and psychiatric status of all participants with the BDI-II, HAM-D and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MINI) questionnaires. Collect information regarding medication status and educational background.\n\tNOTE: These questionnaires were completed as part of a larger investigation including other measures not listed here.\nAsk participants to list troubling thoughts or concerns that they have been repeatedly revisiting over the past few weeks and that they have been unable to shake. Record these oral statements while discussing them with the participant. Working with the participant, paraphrase the statement, shortening it to 7 - 10 words in length and identify a key word that is emotionally significant and explicitly conveys the meaning of the target sentence to the participant.",
    "Prior to the scan, instruct the participant to observe the traffic signal on the screen throughout the paradigm. Instruct the participant to suppress the presented target statement when the red light is presented. Ask the participant to think freely about anything and let their minds wander when the green light is presented.\nInstruct the participants to press the button on the scanner response box each time the target thought re-emerges during both the thought suppression and free thought periods. Finally, ask the participants to press the response box button each time a flashing yellow light is presented.\n\tNOTE: The order of blocks in each functional run is as follows: a) target statement presentation period b) personal or distracter thought suppression period, c) free thought period, and d) motor response period to control for activation of motor areas induced during button presses in the thought suppression and free thought blocks. This pattern repeats 12 times, four times in each of the 3 runs.\nInsert personally relative and distractor target statements and key words into the paradigm. Within each run, ensure the first block consists of two personal thought suppression blocks and two distracter thought suppression blocks (See Figure 1).\n\t\nPresent the shortened statements and key words in a subsequent order and for 1TR each, followed by the traffic light signal for the rest of the target statement presentation period. Counterbalance the order of personal and distracter thought periods within each of the 3 fMRI scans and across participants.\n\t\tNote: Target statements and key words will consist of both personally relevant negative ruminative thoughts provided by the participant (for example: “Think about not getting into university”), and neutral distractor statements taken from a battery prepared by Nolen-Hoeksema (for example: “Think about a row of shampoo bottles on display” 2).",
    "Scan each participant with three functional MRI scans.\n4. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Acquisition and Analysis\nConduct imaging on a 3T whole body short bore scanner with an 8-channel parallel receiver head coil. Perform a T1 weighted three-dimensional SPGR axial anatomical scan with 132 - 160 slices (1 mm thick). Acquire three functional MRI runs using a gradient-echo EPI sequence consisting of 31 axial slices (4 mm thick, no gap) beginning at the cerebral vertex and encompassing the entire cerebrum (TR/TE = 2,500/35 msec, FOV = 24 cm, matrix = 64 x 64, flip angle 90°).\nTransfer the acquired images to a work station.\n\t\nTransform anatomical MRI data sets into Talairach space28 to perform co-registration on functional data sets and average to generate a composite image.\nTemporally correct the functional data sets29. 3D motion correct the functional data sets29. Realign the functional data sets to the 5th frame of each run29. Smooth using a 6 mm Gaussian kernel and normalize to Talairach space29.\nUse an event-related analysis method when analyzing the data. Build an analysis protocol that extracts intervals of time associated with thought suppression, thought re-emergence and successful re-suppression, as outlined below.\nDefine a re-emergence event as the interval beginning 500 msec before the button press (re-emergence of thought prior to button press) and continuing for 2,000 msec after the button press, during the thought suppression or free thinking block. The time spanning the thought suppression block with re-emergence events excluded is to define thought suppression in the analysis protocol.\n\tNOTE: Define successful re-suppression in the analysis protocol as maintained suppression, without an intrusion event, within one TR following the re-suppression event. Define motor control in the protocol as event times when the yellow light flashed during the motor response period.",
    "Using the neuroimaging software, contrast activation maps using a general linear model to identify clusters of activity associated with contrasts between and within groups. Conduct a random effects analyses (3 x 2) with a priori hypothesis testing. Conduct between group contrasts for thought suppression vs. motor control and thought re-emergence vs. re-suppression for control/at-risk vs. depressed, control vs. depressed, control vs. at-risk, and at-risk vs. depressed groups.\nCorrect contrasts for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR, set at p = 0.05) methodology implemented in the neuroimaging software.\nSubscription Required.
