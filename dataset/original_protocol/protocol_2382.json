However, older animals and different breeds have also been successfully used to make brain slices (Pencheva et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Please refer to Humpel, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] for further explanation on the different ages and (dis)advantages.\nNote: The use of cervical dislocation or guillotine is not recommended, as it can damage the brain tissue before dissection.\nPeel away the skin and meninges of the head until the skull becomes visible (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A-I,II).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2020-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mouse brain dissection and vibratome slicing of ex vivo organotypic brain slices\n(A) Example images of dissection steps described in step 2 (I, II), step 3 (III), step 4 (IV, V), step 5 (VI) and step 6 (VII, VIII) of the step-by-step method details. Pictures were taken with a digital photography camera.\n(B) Example images of vibratome slicing steps described in step 9 (I, II), step 10 (III, IV), step 11 (V,VI), step 14 (VII), step 17 (VIII, IX) of the Step-by-Step Methods Details. Pictures were taken with a smartphone camera.\nPlace ultra-fine scissors in the spinal cord and cut until the cerebellum is reached (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A-III).\nCarefully peel away the skull meninges using forceps until the brain is uncovered (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A-IV, V).\nWith ultra-fine scissors make a cut rostral of the olfactory bulb to disconnect the olfactory nerves (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A-VI).",
    "Place forceps caudally under the brain and transfer the brain from the skull into a 50 mL tube containing 25 mL aCSF and place it on ice (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A-VII,VIII).\nRepeat the procedure for the other mice when multiple brains are needed.\nPreparation of ex vivo organotypic brain slices using the vibratome (day 1)\nTiming: 45 min\nIn these steps, we describe the procedure of making brain slices from freshly dissected mouse brains using the vibratome. The procedure described below is adapted from Pencheva et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nTake the vibratome equipment out of the buffer tray with 70% ethanol, remove the ethanol and let everything air-dry.\nPour the aCSF with the brain(s) into a sterile Petri dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-I) and remove the olfactory bulb and cerebellum using a sterile razor blade (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-II).\nPlace the brain on the razor blade with the rostral part facing upward (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-III) and remove residual aCSF from the caudal part by lightly touching the brain-blade interface with a paper tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-IV).\nPlace a drop of Loctite 401 instant adhesive glue on the specimen disk and transfer the brain to the glue with the rostral part facing up (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-V,VI).\nNote: Two additional brains can be transferred to the same specimen disk to slice three brains simultaneously. In this case, make sure that all brains are aligned and oriented in the same direction.\nPlace the specimen disc with the mounted brain tissue into the buffer tray and fixate.\nFill the buffer tray with cold aCSF until the tissue is fully submerged (100 mL).\nPlace a filter tip connected to CO2 into the bucket to carbonate the aCSF (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-VII).\nTurn on the vibratome, set the frequency to 7 Hz and the slicing thickness to 350 μm.",
    "Start trimming off the rostral region of the brain and stop when the lateral ventricles become visible.\nTake the culture plate with the cell inserts out of the incubator and start collecting tissue with visible lateral ventricles. To collect the tissue:\nPlace a sterile spoon underneath the blade and carefully transfer the tissue to the spoon using a sterile brush (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-VIII).\nPour off most of the aCSF and transfer the brain slice to a cell culture insert (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-IX).\nAfter collecting four slices per insert, remove the residual aCSF using a P1000 pipette with filter tip and take the plate to a cell culture laminar flow cabinet.\nWash the slices once with sterile PBS.\nOptional: When the slices are collected in serum-free recovery medium, transfer the cell culture inserts to the culture plate with serum-supplemented recovery medium after the PBS wash.\nPlace the plate with cell culture inserts containing the brain slices in serum-supplemented recovery medium into a 37°C with 5% CO2 incubator for recovery of the brain slices.\nCulture the brain slices overnight (min 24 h).\nInjection of glioma cell lines into the ex vivo organotypic brain slices (day 2)\nTiming: 2–4 h\nThis section describes the preparation of glioma cell suspensions and the injection of the cells into the ex vivo organotypic brain slices (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). The timing needed for these steps is dependent on the number of cell lines and the number of brain slices that will be used in the experiment.\nPrepare the cell-suspensions:\nPassage the cells used for the experiment with standard passaging methods.\nMake cell suspensions of 2.5 × 104 cells/ μL. A minimal volume of 5 μL (1.25 × 105 cells) is needed.",
    "Optional: The invasive and proliferative properties of the experimental group can be directly compared to an internal control group. When choosing for this experimental set-up, mix cells of the internal control cells with fluorophore A one to one with the experimental group expressing fluorophore B. We used H2B-mCherry expressing control cells as an internal control, in combination with experimental groups expressing H2B-mNeonGreen.\nTransfer the ex vivo organotypic brain slices:\nPrepare a 6-well plate with 1 mL neural stem cell (NSC)-medium per insert.\nPrepare a 6-well plate with 2 wells with 1 mL PBS per insert.\nTake the cell culture inserts with ex vivo organotypic brain slices from the incubator.\nDip the inserts two times in 1 mL PBS.\nRemove the remaining recovery medium from the inserts and transfer the inserts to the 6-well plate with NSC-medium.\nPrepare the micromanipulator set-up (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-I):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2020-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bar = 100 μm. Images are taken with an AxioVert A1 epifluorescent microscope.\nClean your working space with 70% ethanol.\nFixate the micromanipulator at the dissection microscope using the magnetic stand.\nPlace the Hamilton syringe in the micromanipulator.\nClean the syringe by washing it first with acetone (1×) and, subsequently, multiple times with 70% ethanol. Finally, rinse the syringe with PBS.\nOrient the plate with organotypic brain slices and the micromanipulator under the dissection microscope.\nPlace the 6-well plate with the organotypic brain slices under the dissection microscope and remove the lid.\nMove the micromanipulator and orient in such a way that the syringe is in the center of view at 4× magnification when touching the organotypic brain slices (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-II,III,IV).\nInject the ex vivo organotypic brain slices with the glioma cell suspensions prepared in step 22:\nMix the cell suspension with a normal pipette and directly take up 0.5 μL with the syringe.\nUsing the micromanipulator, move the syringe to the brain slice. Slowly insert the syringe ∼ 50 μm into the lateral ventricle at an angle of approximately 45 ˚ and afterwards retract it 40 μm out of the tissue.\nInject the cell suspension into the lateral ventricle at low speed (∼30 s per 0.5 μL), to prevent the cells from flushing over the tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A-V, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nSlowly take out the syringe after injection.\nRinse the syringe with PBS multiple times before injecting the next cell line.\nAfter finishing all the injections, rinse the syringe with PBS, 70% ethanol and acetone.",
    "Inspect the organotypic brain slices with a fluorescent microscope to check the presence of fluorescently labeled cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPlace the culture plate in the incubator to culture the ex vivo organotypic brain slices.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Injection of glioma cells into ex vivo organotypic brain slices, related to step 26\nCulturing and fixation of the ex vivo organotypic brain slices (day 2 – day 8)\nTiming: 7 days\nBelow we describe the procedure for culturing the injected organotypic brain slices and fixating them at the end of the co-culture period.\nReplace the medium of the injected organotypic brain slices once every 2 or 3 days by transferring the inserts into a new well with 1 mL of fresh prewarmed NSC-medium.\nAt day 8 (on the 7th day after injection of cells), fixate the ex vivo organotypic brain slices.\nWash the cell culture inserts containing the brain slices one time with PBS.\nPlace the inserts in 2 mL 4% PFA in PBS (covered from light) at 4°C overnight (min 12 h).\nThe next day, wash the inserts 3 times with PBS and store at 4°C until further use.\nNote: The migratory patterns of the glioma cells can be followed during the culturing period using epifluorescence microscopy (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Note, however, that the cells that can be observed with an inverted microscope are the cells that migrate on the membrane rather than into the tissue. To visualize and analyze the cells migrating into the tissue, follow the steps described below.\nPause point: The fixated organotypic brain slices can be stored in PBS for multiple weeks before further processing. Anti-fungal agents can be added when the slices are not used within a month.\nWhole-mount immunostaining and tissue clearing\nTiming: 6 days",
    "In this section, we describe a whole-mount co-immunostaining protocol for the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein laminin and the intermediate filament protein vimentin and describe clearing- and tissue mounting steps required for imaging of the samples. Immunostaining for laminin labels both the vasculature of the mouse brain tissue, as well as the ECM proteins produced by the injected glioma cells at the injection site. The latter allows for distinction between the tumor core and invasive front used during later analysis steps. Vimentin can be used to visualize the larger cellular processes of the glioma cells. The described protocol is an adaptation of the whole-mount immunostaining protocol developed by (Belle et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and the RapiClear 1.47 clearing method developed by the SunJin Lab (www.sunjinlab.com, n.d.[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Bekkouche et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCut the membrane from the inserts around the individual brain slices using a scalpel and transfer the membrane with the brain slice attached to it to a 24-well plate.\nPermeabilize the brain slices in 500 μL 2% PBST (2% Triton-X100 in PBS) at room temperature (19°C–21°C) for 4 h.\nAdd 500 μL PBS-GT (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to the brain slices and incubate at room temperature (19°C–21°C) overnight (min 12 h).\nCritical: The PBS-GT contains thimerosal (a mercury solution) and should be handled with caution, handle solutions containing this compound in a fume hood.\nIncubate the brain slices with primary antibodies:\nAdd primary antibodies to PBS-GT with 0.1% saponin, prepare 250 μL primary antibody mix per sample.\nAdd the mix to the brain slices and incubate at 37°C on a horizontal shaker (70 rpm) for 72 h. Here we used rabbit anti-laminin (1:1 000, specific for human, mouse, and other species) and chicken anti-vimentin (1:1 500, specific for human, mouse, and other species) antibodies.",
    "Wash the brain slices 6 times with PBS-T (0.5% Triton-X100 in PBS) for 1 h per wash (total of 6 h) at room temperature (19°C–21°C).\nIncubate the brain slices with secondary antibodies:\nAdd secondary antibodies to PBS-GT with 0.1% saponin, prepare 250 μL primary antibody mix per sample.\nAdd to the brain slices and incubate at 37°C on a horizontal shaker (70 rpm) for 24 h. Protect from light by covering the well plate with aluminum foil. Here we used donkey anti-rabbit-Cy3 (1:1 000) and donkey anti-chicken-AF647 (1: 1 000) secondary antibodies.\nWash the brain slices 6 times with PBS-T at room temperature (19°C–21°C) for 1 h per wash step (total of 6 h).\nIncubate the brain slices with clearing solution:\nPre-warm RapiClear 1.47 solution at 37°C and add 300 μL to each brain slice.\nPlace on a horizontal shaker at 37°C and incubate for a minimum of 45 min until the brain slice is transparent.\nNote: The used RapiClear solution can be reused maximally three times.\nMount the brain slices within iSpacers on a glass microscopy slide:\nPlace an iSpacer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) on a glass microscopy slide.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2020-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

(VI) Visualization of mouse brain astrocytes with GFAP (green) and invading mCherry expressing U251-MG cells (magenta). Scale bar = 100 μm. Images were taken with a LSM 880 confocal microscope.\nTransfer the brain slices to the microscopy slide. Multiple brain slices can be mounted on one glass microscopy slide.\nFill the iSpacer with fresh RapiClear solution and seal with a coverslip.\nUse clear nail polish to seal the edges of the coverslip.\nStore the microscopy slides at 4°C until further use.\nNote: The membrane can become detached during the procedure. In this case, use a spatula to transfer the brain to the iSpacer. If the brain slice is still attached, use forceps to transfer the membrane with the brain slice to the iSpacer and orient it in such a way that the membrane is on the bottom of the glass microscopy slide. Orienting it the other way around (i.e., when the membrane is facing the coverslip) may interfere with confocal imaging.\nConfocal imaging and image processing\nTiming: 1 h/ brain slice\nThis section describes the procedure for confocal imaging of the whole-mount immunostained brain slice and the preparation of the images for image analysis. We used a 10× objective to capture all tumor cells and to create a 3D reconstruction at the macroscopic level. Higher magnification can be used when smaller parts of the tumors are imaged and higher resolution is needed.",
    "Place the microscopy slide with the cleared brain slices on the stage of a confocal microscope with the coverslip facing the 10× objective. Navigate to the region of interest.\nAdjust the laser power and gain to optimize the signal based on background and fluorescent signal.\nAdjust the number and size of tiles and the top and bottom of the z-stack in such a way that all cells are captured.\nNote: Make sure that the pixel size and step size remain constant when imaging different samples within your experiment. For the 10× objective, we used a pixel size of 1.77 μm/pixel and a step size of 6.07 μm as a minimal XY and Z resolution to allow quantification.\nStitch the tiled images using the confocal software or using the ‘Stitching of 3D images’ plugin (Preibisch et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) in ImageJ. We used four tiled images of 576 × 576 pixels each to capture the tumor region.\nAnnotation and selection of the tumor core based on laminin deposits using ImageJ\nTiming: 15 min/ brain slice\nHere we describe how you can use the laminin immunostaining to distinguish glioma cells residing in the tumor core from those invading the tissue. We explain how to use ImageJ to create an additional channel in the image file where only the laminin signal associated with the tumor core is selected (see also Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nOptional: Before the start of the analysis, use a filename randomizer plugin to blind the images when comparing different experimental conditions.\nOpen the confocal-generated and tiled image in ImageJ. This file should consist of minimally two channels: a channel with the nuclei and a channel with laminin staining.\nCreate a selection of the laminin signal around the tumor core (laminin deposits):\nGo to a z-plane where the nuclei are clearly visible.",
    "Open the Brightness & Contrast (Image > Adjust > Brightness & Contrast).\nLinearly increase the laminin signal by sliding the bar above ‘Maximum’ to the left.\nStop adjusting the histogram until the laminin signal in and around the nuclei become clearly visible (= laminin deposit). The laminin signal from the blood vessels will be saturated at this point.\nDuplicate the channel with the laminin staining (Image > Duplicate). Duplicate the hyperstack for the laminin channel only, for all slices.\nOpen the ROI manager (Analyze> Tools> ROI manager).\nGo to the first plane in the z-stack.\nDraw a region of interest (ROI) around laminin signal of the tumor core.\nSelect polygon selection tool.\nDetermine the border of the tumor core based on the laminin deposit and the density of the nuclei (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-I–III).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2020-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(B) Analysis steps in Imaris to quantify invasion. Open the file created in ImageJ in the Imaris software. With the ‘Create Surface’ tool, create a surface of the tumor core (1). In Imaris version 9.5 or older, use the Distance transformation option to create new channels where the signal intensity represents the distance to or in the tumor core (1b). In newer versions, this step can be replaced by selecting the option ‘Shortest Distance Calculation’ in the first step of creating a surface. Create spots of the H2B-mNeonGreen channel with the ‘Create Spots’ tool (2). In the newly created spots, the software can calculate, display (3), and export the distance to the surface created in (1). Scale bar = 100 μm.\nAdd the selection to the ROI manager by clicking ‘Add[t]’ in the ROI manager.\nNote: In case no tumor core is visible, in the ROI manager go to ‘More>Specify. In this panel, type the value 1 in ‘Width’, ‘Height’, ‘X coordinate’ and ‘Y coordinate’ and leave the ‘Slice’ value at the plane of interest. After clicking OK, a selection of 1 by 1 pixel will be added to the ROI manager. This step is important for further processing at step 49.\nRepeat step 48f for all other z-planes.\nSave the ROIs in a designated folder (ROI manager > More> Save).\nCreate an additional channel of the laminin deposits:\nOpen the ‘Macro’ tool of ImageJ (Plugins > Macros > Startup macros).\nOpen a new file in the ‘Macros’ tool (File > New).

    "Note: After running the macro, the laminin signal outside of the tumor core should have been deleted in every plane and you should be left with the laminin tumor core (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-IV).\nMerge the laminin deposits channel with the original file.\nSelect the original file.\nSplit the original file into separate channels (Image > Color > Split Channels).\nMerge the separate channels of the original file with the laminin tumor core channel created in step 49 (Image > Color > Merge Channels).\nChange the color of the laminin tumor core to distinguish it from the original laminin channel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A-V).\nSave the newly created file (File > Save As).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. ImageJ analysis steps to create a selection of the tumor core based on laminin signal, related to steps 47–51\nAnalysis of the distribution of nuclei in tumor core and invasive front using Imaris software\nTiming: 10 min/ brain slice\nThis section describes the final analysis steps to quantify the number of invaded and non-invaded glioma cells and to quantify the invasion distances (See also Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]). The analysis steps differ depending on the version of Imaris that is used (versions 8.4–9.4 or version 9.5 or higher). Both versions are described below.\nImport the files created and saved in step 51 into the Imaris Software and open the first file in the ‘Surpass’ environment.\nCreate a surface (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, step 1):\nIn Imaris version 9.5 or higher, the first panel in the new surface option is ‘Algorithm Settings’. In this panel select ‘Shortest Distance Calculation’.\nSelect the source channel corresponding to the laminin tumor core. Select the smooth function. In our experiments, we chose a ‘Surface Detail’ of 5 μm.",
    "In the next panel, set the threshold based on ‘Absolute Intensity’. In our experiments, we set the threshold at 2.00.\nIn the next panel, additional filters can be applied to the created surface. This step can be skipped.\nCreate spots of the individual nuclei in the image (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, step 2a):\nIn Imaris version 9.5 or higher, the first panel in the new surface option is ‘Algorithm Settings’. In this panel select ‘Shortest Distance Calculation’.\nSelect the source panel corresponding to the nuclei of the injected glioma cells. For spot detection in our experiments, we chose an ‘Estimated XY Diameter’ of 11 μm.\nSelect ‘Model PSF-elongation along Z-axis’. In our experiments we choose an ‘Estimated Z Diameter’ of 22 μm.\nSelect ‘Background subtraction’.\nIn the next panel, set the threshold for the creation of a spot based on the quality of the signal. In our experiments we choose a quality threshold of 10.\nNote: This step will affect the number of spots that are created and therefore the outcome of your measurements. It is important to optimize these settings.\nFinish the creation of the spots by clicking on the green arrows.\nInspect the spots that are created. Spots that are created based on background signal can be manually deleted in the ‘Edit’ panel.\nImaris version 9.5 or higher: calculate the distance from the individual spots (nuclei) to the created surface (laminin tumor core, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, step 3).\nClick on ‘Statistics ’and go to ‘Detailed’ and select ‘Specific Values’.\nIn the dropdown menu, select ‘Shortest Distance to Surfaces Surfaces = x’ in which x corresponds to the name of surface of the laminin tumor core.\nClick on the ‘Save’ Icon to export the list as an excel file.\nVisualize the distribution of nuclei:\nclick on the ‘Color’ icon.",
    "For ‘Color Type’, select ‘Statistics Coded’.\nIn the dropdown menu select ‘Shortest Distance to Surfaces Surfaces = x’.\nNote: The values and color coding correspond to the closest distance between the individual spots and the border of the surface, with positive values representing nuclei outside of the surface (invaded into the tissue) and negative values representing nuclei within the surface (within the tumor core).\nCritical: The function ‘Shortest Distance Calculation’ during the first step of creating a new surface (step 53a) or spots (step 54a) is a new feature in Imaris, only present in version 9.5 or higher. For older versions, skip step 55 and continue with step 56.\nImaris version 8.4 – 9.4: Perform distance transformation on the created surface (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, step 1b).\nSelect the created surface and click on ‘Tools’.\nSelect the second option: ‘Distance Transformation’. This will start a MATLAB Script embedded within the Imaris Software. Select ‘Outside SurfaceObject’.\nRepeat the ‘Distance Transformation’, this time select ‘Inside SurfaceObject’.\nNote: After completion of these steps, two new channels will be added. In the first one created in step 56b, the intensity of the signal corresponds to the distance to the outside of the surface. In the second one created in step 56c, the intensity of the signal corresponds to the distance to the surface border within the surface.\nImaris version 8.4 – 9.4: Calculate the distance from the individual spots (nuclei) to the created surface (laminin tumor core, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, step 3).\nSelect the created spots, click on ‘Statistics’ and go to ‘Detailed’.\nIn the second dropdown menu, select ‘Intensity Center Ch = x Img 1’, in which Ch = x corresponds to the channel that was created during step 56b (Outside SurfaceObject).\nClick on the ‘Save’ Icon to export the data as an excel file.",

In the file exported in step 57c, values of 0 correspond to nuclei located within the tumor core, whereas values higher than 0 correspond to nuclei outside the tumor core. In the file exported in step 57e, values of 0 correspond to nuclei located outside the tumor core and values higher than 0 to those inside.\nAfter exporting the data on invasion distance from every brain slice, copy the columns with the invasion distances into a single file for further statistical analysis. The number of invading and non-invading cells can be determined and a histogram can be made to show the distribution of cells within the brain slice (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2020-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

This allows for immunostainings with antibodies that are not compatible with the whole-mount immunostaining method. In the next sections we describe how a BrdU assay can be performed on glioma cells injected into organotypic brain slices, to determine the level of proliferation of these cells.\nPrepare the organotypic brain slices and inject the glioma cells as described before, up to step 30 of this protocol.",
    "On the 7th day after injection, place a drop of 50 μL 40 mM 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyridine (BrdU) in NSC-medium on top of the lateral ventricles containing the glioma cells and incubate at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 6 h (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2020-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. BrdU assay to determine proliferation\n(A) Schematic representation of BrdU assay.\n(B) Example images of cryo-sectioning & immunostaining steps described in step 65(I), step 66 (II), step 67a (III), step 67b (IV), step 74 (V) and step 75 (VI) of the step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details]. Pictures were taken with a smartphone camera.\n(C) Sectioned organotypic brain slice injected with H2B-mNeonGreen (green) cells, stained with BrdU (magenta) and counterstained with Hoechst (cyan). Scale bar = 100 μm. Images were taken with an AxioScope A1 epifluorescent microscope.\nAfter 6 h of incubation with BrdU, fixate and wash the tissue as described in steps 31 and 32 of this protocol.\nCryosectioning of fixated organotypic brain slices\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes the cryosectioning procedure of the fixated organotypic brain slices incubated with BrdU.\nCut the membrane of the insert around the individual brain slices and transfer to an embedding mold.\nSubmerge the brain slices in 30% sucrose in PBS solution (pH = 7.2) and incubate at 4°C for 48 h. Upon incubation in the sucrose solution, the brain slices should have sunk to the bottom of the embedding mold.\nRemove the sucrose solution and wash the slices once with PBS.\nAdd Tissue Tek to the brain slices and snap freeze by placing the embedding molds in 2-Methylbutan (−55°C) on dry-ice for 2 min until the Tissue Tek is frozen (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B-I).\nTransfer the snap-frozen brain slices to a cryostat with a chamber temperature of −20°C and an objective temperature of −18°C (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B-II).",
    "Use the cryostat to section the brain slices into 20 μm sections.\nAfter making a section, hover over the tissue with a SuperFrost Plus Adhesion microscope slide so the tissue will spontaneously and permanently attach to it (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B-III).\nCollect the tissue on different microscopy slides in a series of four or five (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B-IV).\nNote: Take time to orient the brain slice at the right angle relative to the knife of the cryostat, so that it matches the cutting surface of the vibratome sections.\nUpon collection of all tissue, let the sections dry at room temperature (19°C–21°C) until the Tissue Tek has evaporated. Store the microscopy slides at −20°C or directly proceed to the immunofluorescence staining.\nBrdU Immunofluorence staining of tissue sections\nTiming: 2 days\nThe section below describes the antigen retrieval and immunofluorescence procedure to immunostain BrdU-positive cells and the analysis steps to calculate the percentage of BrdU-positive cells in the cryosectioned tissue slices.\nTake out the glass microscope slides from −20°C and air dry in an incubation box (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B-V).\nWash the tissue three times with PBS to get rid of the remaining traces of Tissue Tek.\nPerform antigen retrieval on the tissue sections.\nCover the tissue sections with HCl 2 N and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nIncubate the tissue sections in Borate Buffer at room temperature (19°C–21°C) for 15 min.\nWash three times in PBS (pH = 7.2) with 0.25% Triton-X100.\nDab the edges of the glass microscope slides carefully with a tissue paper without touching the brain tissue. Delimit the area around the brain tissue with a hydrophobic pen to minimize antibody volume.\nIncubate the tissue sections in blocking buffer (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) at room temperature (19°C–21°C) for 90 min.\nIncubate the tissue sections with BrdU primary antibodies:",
    "Add the antibody to blocking buffer diluted 1:1 in PBS. Prepare 100–300 μL per microscopy slide, dependent on the size of the delimited area. In our experiments, we used rat anti-BrdU (1:500).\nPlace the microscopy slides with tissue sections in a humidified chamber by placing wet paper tissues in the incubation box (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B-V).\nAdd the primary antibody mix to the microscopy slides and incubate at 4°C overnight (min 12 h).\nWash the tissue sections three times for 5–10 min with PBS by transferring the microscopy slides to a slide staining jar on a shaker (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B-VI).\nIncubate the tissue sections with secondary antibodies:\nAdd the secondary antibodies and Hoechst (1: 1 000) or an alternative nuclear stain to PBS with 0.25% triton. Prepare 100–300 μL per microscopy slide, dependent on the size of the delimited area.
