    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMice perfusion and dissection\nTiming: 30 min / mouse\nWe routinely performed this protocol for young and old (3 weeks to 24 months old) mouse tissue from whole brain, or from dissected regions such as prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and white matter. While we have not tested this protocol on every age and region of the mouse brain, we believe that it is capable of isolating single cells from all regions and ages of mouse brain samples. We recommend performing a pilot experiment to determine the number of cells that can be obtained from the region of interest with one animal, then scale up accordingly. For the white matter tissue and prefrontal cortex (gray matter), we generally pool white matter dissected tissue from 2–3 mice together in one C tube. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nTissue harvesting\nAnesthetize the mice and transcardially perfuse with 20 mL cold perfusion solution for 3–5 min as described by Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nPerform cervical dislocation, cut the head and carefully free the brain from the skull. A proper transcardial perfusion results in white not pink colored brain. Transfer the brains in 15 mL tubes filled with ice-cold DPBS-CMF.\nDissection of targeted brain region. (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Microdissection of White and Grey matter of mouse brain, related to step 2.)",
    "Set up the dissection workplace to keep tissue ice cold during dissection as shown in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C. Perform the dissection in a petri dish (60/15 mm or similar), filled with cold DBPS-CMF, and on ice. Microdissected tissue are transferred to a new petri dish (60/15 mm or similar), filled with cold 1 mL of Enzyme Mix 1, and on ice. Prepare separate petri dish for each target regions (e.g one carrying white matter tissue and the other gray matter tissue Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). An explanatory Movie describing the mouse brain dissection of white and gray matter of the prefrontal cortex is provided (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). The total dissection of all samples should be as quick as possible, and the total duration should be less than 2 hours. To prevent transcriptional responses, brains should be kept cold on ice and dissected tissue immediately placed in ice cold Enzyme Mix 1 with transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (Wu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nCritical: All steps should be done on ice except the enzymatic digestion.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Microdissection of White and Grey matter of mouse brain, related to step 2\nTissue dissociation\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this step the tissue is dissociated using the automized gentleMACS™ Octo Dissociator with a customized program, which decreases technical variation compared to manual mechanical dissociation.\nAdd 30 μL of Enzyme Mix 2 to each C Tube.\nTightly close the C Tubes and attach them upside down onto the gentleMACS™ OctoDissociator. Tap the tubes to move tissue on the walls into enzyme mix.\nRun the “15 min dissociation program” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/712-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Filter the dissociated tissue samples by pouring the dissected tissues onto the filters.\nAdd 9.5 mL of cold DPBS-CMF into each C Tubes, shake them gently and add the liquid to the respective filter to collect remaining tissue fragments and cells.\nDiscard the 70 μm filter and centrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant slowly and avoid disturbing the cell pellet.\nCritical: The gentleMACS™ OctoDissociator is using a custom shortened program for scRNA-seq, which may decrease cell yield, but is half of the duration which, as a result, limits transcriptional responses to dissociation.\nOriginal gentleMACS™ Program for dissecting brain tissue:\n20–100 mg: 37C_ABDK_02\n>100 mg: 37C_ABDK_01.\nWe use a custom gentleMACS™ Octo Dissociator program (Supplementary file 1) optimized for microdissected tissue for scRNA-seq.\nInstruction on how to install the program in the gentleMACS™ Octo Dissociator:\nFirst create a folder named “GM8” in a USB stick, and copy the program file into this folder.\nThen connect the USB stick to the device\nClick in the USB stick folder logo that appears on the left side of the screen\nSelect the program file “37C_cus_NT_15_1” by clicking on the checkbox on the right side",
    "Click the Save button. A window will appear asking where to save the file. In this window click on the folder logo to find the folder where to save the file. Click ok.\nOpen the destination folder to ensure that the transfer was successful. For more details, please refer to gentleMACS™ Octo Dissociator with Heaters Manuals section 4.5.1.\nNote: The program “37C_cus_NT_15_1” consists of three incubations at 37°C of 4.5 min each and in between each incubation there is mechanical dissociation. First mechanical dissociation is set at 100 rpm and the last two are set at 300 rpm. The temperature is set to 37°C during the whole program. The total duration of the program is 15 min.\nNote: If the gentleMACS™ Octo Dissociator is not available in the lab, preheat the tissue in the Enzyme Mix 1 at 37°C for 15 min in a water bath at 37°C and proceed with manual dissociation on ice. For the manual dissociation, tissues should be triturated by three separate flame-polished Pasteur pipets with successively smaller openings (Preparation of 3 Pasteur Pipets and their application are described by (Bordt et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) and continue with Step 10.\nDebris removal\nTiming: 40 min\nIn this step, cell debris are removed by a gradient centrifugation to obtain a single-cell suspension.\nResuspend the cell pellet gently in 1550 μL of cold DPBS-CMF and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL falcon. Do not vortex cell suspensions!\nAdd 450 μL of cold Debris Removal Solution from the “Adult Brain Dissociation Kit”.\nMix well by using a 1000 μL pipette.\nOverlay very gently and slowly with 2 times 1 mL cold DPBS-CMF by using a 1000 μL pipette.\nCentrifuge at 4°C and 3000 × g for 10 min with acceleration 9 and brake 9.",
    "Three layers will form (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Aspirate the two top layers completely with a vacuum pump.\nFill the tube up to 5 mL with cold DPBS-CMF.\nGently invert the tube three times. Do not vortex!\nCentrifuge at 4°C and 1000 × g for 10 min with acceleration 9 and brake 9. Aspirate supernatant completely and avoid disrupting the cell pellet.\nCritical: After the debris removal part, the next step depends on which method is chosen by the researchers.\nDroplet based scRNA-seq: please follow the tiles with “for 10× Genomics”, continue with step 19.\nPlate based scRNA-seq: please follow the tiles with “for flow cytometry”, continue with step 32.\nMyelin removal (for 10× Genomics)\nTiming: 60 min\nThe myelin removal part is necessary to remove myelin and big clumps, which can block the 10× loading chip. This step also removes most of the oligodendrocytes. A comparison of cell suspensions under light microscopy, before and after the myelin removal part, is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 270 μL of loading buffer and add 30 μL Myelin Removal Beads II. Mix well with the pipette, but do not vortex. Incubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nNote: These specific volumes are sufficient to remove myelin as well as most of the oligodendrocytes from cell suspension of grey matter and white matter from three adult animals. Adjust the bead volume for the target brain region according to the data sheet.\nWash the cells by adding 10 times the labeling volume (in this case: 2700 μL of loading buffer) and centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min.\nDuring the centrifugation time, place the appropriate number of LS Column (according to manufacturer of Myelin Removal Beads II) in the magnetic field of a suitable MACS Separator (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).",
    "Note: From now on, preferably work in a 4°C cold room until step 26 is done.\nRinse the column with 3 mL loading buffer.\nAfter the centrifugation, aspirate the supernatant completely.\nAdd 1000 μL of loading buffer for each LS Column and resuspend the cells.\nApply the cell suspension onto the LS column. Collect the unlabeled cells that pass through. This is the myelin freed sample. Do not trash!\nWash the column with 2 times 1 mL of loading buffer. Collect the total effluent, since it still contains the myelin freed sample. Only add new buffer for washing when the column reservoir is completely empty.\nFilter the collected cell suspension through a 30 μm filter (prewetted with 500 μL DPBS-CMF)\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 300 × g at 4°C.\nCell counting (for 10× Genomics)\nTiming: 10 min\nThe cell number and viability are counted to confirm that the requirements for loading the sample on a 10× genomics chromium controller are fulfilled. After a final filtering step, the single-cell suspension is ready to be loaded on the 10× Genomics Chip.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant and gently resuspend gray matter cell pellets in 120–160 μL of loading buffer (for 10× Genomics), and white matter cell pellets in 60–80 μL of loading buffer.\nNote: When doing the experiment for the first time, start the resuspension with a quite low volume, so the cell density can be adjusted to 10× Genomics requirements accordingly.\nTake 10 μL of the cell suspension and mix thoroughly with 10 μL of trypan blue. Load the mixture into a manual cell counting slide or an automated cell counter such as Bio-Rad T20 to determine the live and dead cells concentrations. Adjust the cell concentrations according to the recommendation of the 10× Genomics protocol.

    "Critical: If the protocol is done fast enough, the live cell ratio should be above the 70% recommended in the 10× protocol. If cell survival is low, optimize the duration of the protocol and make fresh buffers.\nBefore loading, filter the low volume cell suspension through a 45 μm filter (flow cytometry cell strainer).\nFor filtering, detach the cap of a flow cytometry cell strainer from the tube and discard the tube. Pre-wet the 45 μm filter in the cap with 1000 μL of DPBS-CMF.\nThen carefully add the sample on top of the filter. On the bottom side of the filter, a drop will form.\nCarefully draw the hanging drop from the bottom of the filter with a 1000 μL pipette (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/712-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Images on using the flow cytometry cell strainer to filter low volume cell suspension\nCritical: This filtering approach will free the small volume sample from debris gently with minimal loss.\nNote: The data of single cell RNA-seq can be analyzed with Seurat (Stuart et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), or other available platforms.\nIsolation of microglia from cell suspensions (for flow cytometry)\nTiming: 70 min\nIf the plate based scRNA-seq is required, after finishing step 18, please directly continue with step 32.\nThe single cell suspension is labeled with antibodies for flow cytometry, to finally gate microglia.\nAfter the debris removal part, resuspend the cell pellets in 1 mL DPBS-CMF and filter the collected cell suspensions through a 30 μm filter (prewetted with the 500 μL DPBS-CMF) into 15 mL falcon. Wash the filter with 2 times 1 mL of DPBS-CMF and collect the total effluent.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 300 × g at 4°C and discard the supernatant.",
    "For each flow cytometry sample, resuspend the cell pellet (up to 107 cells) gently in 50 μL of blocking buffer. Incubate the samples for 10 min at 4°C.\nMeanwhile, prepare the desired antibody staining mixture.\nCritical: All antibodies should be tested beforehand with unstained and single stained controls. We recommend applying the compensation process on the flow cytometry machine using control samples (unstained control samples and single stained control samples).\nAfter the 10 min incubation, add 50 μL of the prepared antibody staining mixture to each sample. Incubate the samples for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nThen add 3 mL of DPBS-CMF to each sample.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 300 × g at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant by a vacuum pump and/or by pipettes. Remove as much liquid as possible.\nAdd 500 μL of flow cytometry buffer to resuspend the pellet.\nPut 7-AAD (final concentration: 25 μg/mL) in each sample and incubate for 5 min at 4°C in the dark (7-AAD can be used for the exclusion of non-viable cells in flow cytometry analysis).\nContinue cell sorting in a single cell sorting mode with a flow cytometer (e.g., Sony SH800) selecting the proper gates for each antibody.\nStandard forward scatter height versus area criteria were used to discard doublets and capture singlets. A membrane impermeant dye (7-AAD) is used for negative selection to remove dead cells. For the gating strategy for microglia, see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].
