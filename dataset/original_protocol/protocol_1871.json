    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnalysis of time-lapse videos to study primary cilia dynamics\nTiming: 3–4 days\nHere we describe in detail the analysis of primary cilia growth/resorption in living cells on the example of mNeonGreen-ARL13b cell line prepared in the previous steps.\nDay 1: Seed the cells (here we used hTERT-RPE-1 Flp-In T-REx TTBK2 KO cells (Bernatik et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) with DOX-inducible expression of FLAG-TTBK2 and constitutive mNeonGreen-ARL13b reporter) in a RPE-1 complete medium supplemented with DOX on a 10-well glass-bottom CELLVIEW CELL CULTURE SLIDE, PS, 75/25 MM at a high density (∼25.000–30.000 cells per well).\nNote: Typically we use DOX in 1 μg/mL final concentration, please see DOX optimization step in the section “Generation of stable cell lines using Flp-InTM T-RExTM system[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]”.\nNote: Other types of chamber slides can also be used here. Throughout this protocol we used CELLVIEW CELL CULTURE SLIDE or IBidi μ-Slide. We recommend choosing CELLVIEW CELL CULTURE SLIDE for long-term experiments such as cilia growth/resorption analysis. Their black chambers offer better protection from light during adjacent well imaging. Moreover, the area of the chamber is smaller and volume of the medium higher, thus decreasing the risk of medium evaporation compared to IBidi μ-Slide.\nNote: For the imaging setup using LSM800 (described below) it is advised to use adjacent wells and limit the analysis to 3 conditions (3 wells) maximum to reduce the movement of the slide during imaging. Increasing the number of wells/conditions comes hand in hand with increased time the microscope needs to move between each condition/well and increasing the chance the immersion runs dry.\nDay 2 (the exact timing may differ in respect to your experimental treatment): Depending on the biological question, this is probably the time to treat the cells as needed (e.g., small molecules, siRNA transfection, etc.).",
    "Day 3 (the exact timing may differ in respect to your experimental treatment):\nWash the cells with PBS or serum-free low auto-fluorescence FluoroBrite medium (imaging medium) to remove the remnants of the previous media.\nAdd Imaging medium (supplemented with 1 μg/mL of DOX) to the cells to promote ciliogenesis. Add as much medium as possible in the well to prevent its evaporation during the long imaging (we typically use about 300 μL/well).\nDepending on the experimental question either proceed directly to live-cell imaging to monitor the growth of the cilia.\nOr starve the cells for 24 h to promote cilia formation, and before imaging add Imaging medium with 10% FBS (supplemented with 1 μg/mL of DOX, see above) to monitor cilia resorption.\nTime-lapse live imaging of cilia dynamics acquisition",
    "Given that live cells growing on the surface of the slide are to be imaged in this setup, an inverted microscope system is required. To keep the cells in optimal conditions throughout the whole imaging session (in our case up to 16 h), it is necessary to use a microscope equipped with an environmental chamber, which allows precise control of temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels. The confocal microscope compared to a widefield microscope offers a better signal-to-background noise ratio which might be helpful to extract the specific signal in cells with a higher background signal as seen in our reporter cell line. Inside living tissue, the important events can occur deep within the specimen, further away from the cover glass. Water immersion objectives typically overcome spherical aberrations better than oil immersion objectives, as it better matches the sample refractive index. Due to the increased evaporation it is recommended to use water oil immersion e.g., Zeiss Immersol Immersion oil W 2010 (Carl Zeiss, 444969-0000-000). Moreover, it is very helpful and convenient if the microscope – operating software allows multi-position acquisition with easy position list setup, which will enable to add specific positions of the cells with cilia.",
    "Here we used Inverted (Axio Observer.Z1) laser scanning confocal and epifluorescence microscope LSM800 equipped with an environmental chamber for live-cell imaging (controlled temperature, humidity, CO2). We opted for C-Apochromat 63×/1.20 Korr UV VIS IR water immersion objective. Solid state laser 488 in combination with high-sensitivity GaAsP detector were used to acquire images and the microscope was controlled by ZEN Blue software. Data acquisition was performed in 1024 × 1024 pixel format, with pixel time around 1μs and pixel size 0.10 μm in bidirectional mode with 2× averaging and 8-bit bit depth. Images were taken as Z-stacks thickness 0.6 μm with 0.5 μm slices spacing (see the note below) every 10–15 min for up to 16 h.\nNote: Being aware that the optimal Z-slice spacing according to the Nyquist criterion would be lower (0.28 μm) we opted for 0.5 μm slice spacing. This allowed us to keep around 10% overlap between the slices, while significantly reducing the time of acquisition and in turn sample bleaching. Importantly, this setting also allows to use of wider range in the Z-axis, which is particularly relevant for imaging cilia, as they typically spread across the Z-axis. We did not observe any loss of information when using the maximal projection image for the final cilia length analysis.\nOpen the ZEN Blue Software.\nTurn on the temperature and atmosphere control in the “Incubation” window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) at least 20 min before starting the microscope setup for the chamber to reach the set incubation conditions. After sample insertion in the holder the microscope setup will take another 30–40 min, thus the whole system is equilibrated at least for one hour before the actual start of the imaging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "(A) Incubation conditions, (B) localizing the cells using the eyepiece and (C) Imaging Setup details.\nPut a drop of the appropriate immersion medium (here we used a Zeiss Immersol Immersion oil W 2010 with a refractive index of water) on the selected objective and insert the slide with the cells in the slide holder, close the chamber with the lid.\nIn the “Locate” tab (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) turn on the fluorescence (represented by “GFP” button) and find the focus looking on the specimen through the eyepiece. You can search specifically for a cell with cilium here. Make sure to close the shutter as soon as you find the sample focus, to avoid sample bleaching.\nSwitch to “Acquisition” tab (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C), select “Z-stack”, “Tiles” and “Time series” and “Auto Save” to add the particular windows with setup options.\nIn the “Imaging Setup” window (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) add “+LSM Confocal”, add “Tracks” in a “Frame” mode, here we only use one channel, thus one Track. Select the “Dye” (here we used the preset EGFP) and the “Color code”.\nIn the “Acquisition Mode” window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) set the “Scan Speed” to get the “Pixel speed” around 1μs. Bidirectional “Direction” of scanning will make the imaging faster and 2× “Averaging” reduces noise and improves image quality.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "In the “Channels” window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) select one Track at a time, turn on the appropriate laser (here 488 nm for GFP and its derivates such as mNeonGreen), start with the “Master Gain” on ∼650 V, and in the Live mode increase the laser % to see your cells and/or your cilia signal. Keep in mind to leave the laser intensity as low as possible, considering the possible bleaching effect or even cell death over time.\nFind the position with the cells of interest either in “Locate” or “Live” mode and add them in “Positions” list in the “Tiles” window by clicking on a “+” button until all positions to be imaged are added to the list. Uncheck the “Tile Regions/Position – Sort by Y then X”, so the positions stay in the order added also for the imaging (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Setup of the Zeiss LSM800 in ZEN Blue, step 25\nCreating a list of Positions for the subsequent imaging.\nNote: When planning the experiment, keep in mind that only a limited number of positions can be imaged in one experiment, depending on the number of conditions/wells, number of channels, and number of the Z-slices to fit into the selected time between the timepoints. This is also highly dependent on the microscope system of your choice. With our setting with imaging two conditions in one channel, 10–15 Z-slices each and 10–15 min between the steps we used up to 20 positions in total.",
    "In the “Definite Focus” window (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A) in “Live” mode click “Find Surface”, if necessary fine-tune the focus on the center of the cell/cilium and click Store Focus. This creates an offset value, which will be used to set the focus plane in the same distance from the automatically found focus before each timepoint. It is also possible to do this step right at the beginning of the imaging to find the focus plane of the cells and thus eliminating the need for the manual search of the focus plane.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Setup of the Zeiss LSM800 in ZEN Blue, steps 26–29\n(A) Definite Focus and Offset setup (B) Focusing strategy details (C) Setup of the Z-stack and (D) Time Series.\nIn the “Focus Strategy” window (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B) choose:\n“Use Focus Surface/Z Values Defined by Tiles Setup”.\nIn “Focus Surface” choose “Local (per Region/Position)”.\nCheck “Adapt Focus Surface/Z values” with “Definite focus”, “Update with Multiple Offsets”.\nIn “Initial Definition of Support Points/Positions/Tile Regions” choose “By Definite Focus: Recall Focus”.\nWith this setting before each new timepoint, the software will find the surface and update the focus plane, which would help with the loss of focus during the long-term imaging.\nIn the “Z-stack” window (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C) in the “Center” mode set the desired number of slices, and the interval between them, the center position will be taken from the “Tiles setup”, as set in the “Focus Strategy” above.\nIn “Time Series” window (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D) set “Duration” to “As Long as Possible” so the scanning will continue until manually stopped or set a precise number of cycles. Set an interval between the individual time points and the units – here we used 10 or 15 min.\nIn “AutoSave” window fill in the file name and the saving path.",

Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nFor further analysis, the Z-slices can be projected in one layer by Orthogonal maximal projection. This is particularly useful when imaging objects like cilia, which spread through several Z slices. To do so:\nHave your Z-stack ∗.czi file to be processed in the active tab.\nGo to “Processing” tab.\nIn “Method” find “Orthogonal Projection”.\nSet “Projection Plane” to “Frontal (XY)”, set “Method” to “Maximum” and click “Apply”.\nThis will create a maximum intensity projection of all the Z planes into a single XY image.\nThe resulting file contains all the positions as “Scenes” in one large ∗.czi file. To export individual positions to individual TIFF files:\nHave the ∗.czi file to be processed in the active tab (it can be either the original Z-stack or processed Orthogonal Projection file).\nGo to “Processing” tab.\nIn “Method” find OME/TIFF export.\nIn the “Method Parameters” unselect “Merge All Scenes” and set the path for the exported TIFF images, click “Apply”.\nImaging of intraflagellar transport (IFT) in primary cilia of living cells\nTiming: ∼4 days (according to the type of treatment)\nThis section covers live-cell imaging analysis of IFT, namely the measurement of transport frequency and velocity, in primary cilia of hTERT-RPE-1 cells stably expressing mNeonGreen-tagged protein IFT74 (pGFT1.1 - mNeonGreen-IFT74).\nDay 1: Seed the hTERT-RPE-1 mNeonGreen-IFT74 reporter cell line in RPE-1 complete medium supplemented with DOX (typically 1 μg/mL, please see DOX optimization step in the section “Generation of stable cell lines using Flp-InTM T-RExTM system[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]”) on IBidi ibiTreat μ-Slide 8 well chamber slide (see note after step 14 in the previous section of this protocol) at a high density (∼25.000 cells per well). We used 300 μL of the media per well.",
    "Day 2 (the exact timing may differ in respect to your experimental treatment): Depending on the biological question, this is probably the time to treat the cells as needed (e.g., small molecules, siRNA transfection, etc.).\nDay 3 (the exact timing may differ in respect to your experimental treatment):\nAspirate the medium from the cells grown in μ-Slide 8 well chamber slide.\nWash the cells with PBS or imaging medium to remove the remnants of the previous media. Aspirate the solution for each well.\nAdd Imaging medium (supplemented with 1 μg/mL of DOX, see above) to the cells to promote ciliogenesis.\nAfter 24 h proceed directly to live-cell imaging to monitor the transport of IFT trains.\nNote: If your experimental setup is based on the use of small molecule(s), do not forget to add them to the media. If you want to study more rapid response to your intervention, it is probably better to start the treatment just before the imaging (see below).\nTime-lapse live imaging of IFT in primary cilia acquisition",
    "As the copy number of each IFT protein in a given train is rather low (Ishikawa and Marshall, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]), the signal emitted by mNeonGreen-tagged IFT protein per each train is weak. Typically, this could be circumvented by using long exposures to increase the signal-to-noise, but imaging the IFT trains requires taking images at a fast enough rate that the movement of the trains does not cause blurring in the image. Thus, it is necessary to use both fast and sensitive instrumentation. For this purpose, we have employed an inverted Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning confocal microscope mounted on an Axio Observer.7 stand and equipped with an Airyscan detector. We opted for alpha Plan-Apochromat 100×/1.46 oil differential interference contrast M27 immersion objective. Compact light source HXP120V mercury lamp was used for the ocular observation. Images were acquired using Multiline Argon laser 35 mW in combination with a ZEISS Airyscan detector and the microscope was controlled by ZEN Black acquisition software. Data acquisition was performed using the confocal in super resolution mode, with the Airyscan detector, Pixel Dwell Time below 1 μs and Scan Time below 200 ms (depending on scan speed), 16 Bit Depth (8 bit depth can also be used, it could actually help for dim the sample) and Zoom 8–11 (depending on the length of imaged cilia). Images were taken as Time Series taking an image every 200 ms, with 150 images in total. The Airyscan detector allows acquisition with increased resolution and signal-to- noise ratio compared to conventional confocal scanning. A spinning disk confocal microscopy, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent (TIRF), or “TIRF-like” microscopy (see the section “Imaging IFT using variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy” for details) is also suitable for the IFT imaging due to reduced bleaching of the fluorescence signal and very good signal-to-background noise ratio, in comparison to e.",
    "g., standard wide-field microscopy.",
    "Note: Using an oil objective with a higher numerical aperture (NA) will allow for higher resolution imaging, especially in combination with the Airyscan detector (in comparison to the water objective used in the previous section).\nBefore beginning the imaging, prepare the microscope of your choice (here Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan detector, operated via ZEN Black acquisition software according to your needs (e.g., preheat the chamber to 37°C and equilibrate it with CO2 (see step 18 in the previous section), switch on argon laser, etc.).\nOpen the ZEN Black acquisition software.\nPut a drop of the appropriate immersion medium on the selected objective and insert the μ-Slide 8 well coverslips with the cells in the slide holder.\nIn the “Locate” tab turn on the fluorescence (represented by “GFP” button) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A) and find the focus with the eyepiece. You can search specifically for a cell with cilium here.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Select the “Dye” and a “Color code”.\nSelect the “Acquisition” tab (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A) and tick “Time Series”. The recommended settings of key parameters of the “Acquisition Mode” window (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B) to start with is the following:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

    "Zoom: typically 8–11, depending on the length of imaged cilia.\nNote: For our imaging setup it was sufficient to acquire images in one focus plane in “Airyscan super resolution” module. However, in case the use of Z-stack is desirable the “Fast module” could be used instead of the “Airyscan super resolution” to shorten the time of individual acquisition steps.\nSet laser line attenuator transmission (for 488 nm: 0.5%) and select the “Airyscan Mode / SR” (superresolution) in “Channels” window (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C).\nSet “Cycles” (up to 150) and “Intervals” (to 200 ms) in “Time Series” window (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]D).\nWhile being in “Live mode”, adjust focus on primary cilia and select a region of interest with the cilium you want to analyze, click on “Start Experiment” (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A). Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nFollowing the time-lapse acquisition, a ∗.czi file is created and saved locally.\nGo to the “Processing” window and select “Airyscan Processing”, “Select” and then Apply (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). Airyscan processing is a type of post-acquisition processing, which allows for simultaneous improvement in resolution and signal-to-noise. This generates a processed ∗.czi file with better resolution than the unprocessed ∗.czi file. For illustration of the processed file see Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

    "Note: For the analysis of IFT74 dynamics in primary cilia we used auto setting of Airyscan processing. For the analysis of molecule movement it is sufficient to use the auto setting when the strength of the filter is calculated for each image separately, which results in different Airyscan processing values. However, when comparing structure sizes or intensities between different samples, the same optimized Airyscan processing setting (with manually adjusted strength of the processing) should be reused in the whole set of images which are to be compared.\nRepeat the steps 45–47 to obtain a sufficient number of recordings of primary cilia per each condition of your experiment. We recommend measuring at least 20 primary cilia per experimental condition to get sufficiently robust data for the subsequent analysis.\nNote: The speed of IFT movement is typically between 0.25 and 1 μm/s (Figure 17[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig17]C) (Ishikawa and Marshall, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). The settings described above allow taking an image every 200 ms, with 150 images in total, which is typically sufficient to detect the movement of IFT trains. We try to minimize the bleaching of IFT trains by setting laser power to minimal levels. Please consider adjusting these parameters according to your needs to get optimal results.\nNote: Primary cilia in non-polarized cells (e.g., hTERT-RPE-1) are typically confined in a deep narrow pit created by membrane invagination (Mazo et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]; Sorokin, 1962[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]). While response of such “submerged” primary cilia to clues, such as fluid flow, is limited (Mazo et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]), their imaging and IFT analysis is, in turn, fairly straightforward (as they do not significantly move).\nPause point: The subsequent computer analysis can be done at any time.",
    "Here we describe how to assemble obtained images into a kymograph (a very convenient tool to visualize time-lapse data in a single image) and to determine the velocity and frequency of IFT trains. To analyze the obtained data for IFT movement dynamics we suggest using Fiji software (2.1.0 version or newer, no specific plug-ins are required).\nNote: Commercial image analysis software packages (e.g., MetaMorph) are also suitable.\nStart the Fiji software to open an Airyscan processed ∗.czi file (i.e., drag and drop the file to Fiji toolbar or click on File → Open…) (Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], steps 49a–c).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S2.

Draw a segmented line from the base to the tip of the primary cilium (left-click to start drawing and adding points, right-click to finish the drawing) and measure the length of the cilium by selecting the panel “Analyze” → “Measure” or keyboard shortcut Ctrl+M. The measured length will be displayed as μm in “Results” window. All steps of time-lapse imaging analysis of IFT transport dynamics using Fiji software can also be found in the tutorial videos (Methods Videos S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]; ).",
    "Critical: Draw the line from base to tip of the primary cilium. To position the cilium correctly, pay attention to the signal difference between the base and the tip (the foci of IFT protein signal at the ciliary base is typically more prominent and also of different shape over the IFT pool in the tip, Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]). Alternatively, detection of the cilia orientation can be facilitated by expressing additional markers, such as a basal body protein fused with a red fluorescent tag (e.g., mCherry-TTBK2). In a situation the orientation is not clear, exclude such primary cilium from the analysis.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S3.

    "Note: Note that the base of the imaged cilium is now at the bottom of the obtained kymograph, while the ciliary tip is at its top (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]A). Consequently, the first image of time-lapse is situated on the very left side of the obtained kymograph, which can in turn be used to track any detected movement of mNeonGreen-IFT74 particles inside the cilium.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Tracking of movement in kymograph\n(A) The kymograph represents the movement of IFT74 particles inside the primary cilium (PC). The primary cilium base and tip are at the bottom and top of the kymograph, respectively. The first image of the time-lapse is located on the left side of the kymograph. The green arrow shows the anterograde transport going from the base to the tip of the cilium while the red arrow indicates the retrograde transport going from the tip to the base of the cilium.\n(B) Tracks in the kymograph can be distinguished by color and numbers. Green lines represent the anterograde transport while red lines depict retrograde transport.\n(C) The visualized tracks in the kymograph have to be overlaid from ROI manager before you save the image.\nIFT trains inside cilia use either anterograde or retrograde type of transport (Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). To track the movement of individual IFT trains, draw straight lines (right-click on a Segmented line in Fiji toolbar and choose Straight Line) through all visible tracks of IFT74 trains in the kymograph and add them to the “ROI manager”.\nNote: Note that we track only trajectories clearly distinguishable from the background signal (in turn the drawn lines sometimes do not fully span from the tip to the base).\nSelect the “ROI Manager” panel and click “Measure” (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).",
    "Note: Remember that only the IFT train trajectories tracked in the kymograph in step 49c will be measured. The obtained values represent an angle between each measured trajectory and the horizontal axis, the speed of IFT train is calculated by tan(angle) (Ishikawa and Marshall, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Because the unit of tan(angle) is given in pixel, this can be converted into μm/s by multiplying pixel size and frequency (frames per second), see step 54. The positive angle values represent the anterograde transport while the negative values represent the retrograde transport.\nNote: Keep in mind that only IFT trains “passing through” the drawn line (step 49c) will be included in kymograph analysis. Consequently, it may be necessary to draw an additional line to “cover” all IFT particles recorded in the time-lapse Movie.\nOptional: To add a color code in the kymograph for better orientation, click on the line or the number in “ROI Manager”, select “Properties” in “ROI Manager”, and change the color (Video 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). In Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]B shown as an example, the anterograde transport lines are shown in green while the lines representing the retrograde transport are in red (see for details). The numbering of lines is done automatically, but you can hide the numbers by checking off “Labels” in “ROI Manager” (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nOptional: To save the kymograph with overlaid track visualization, select “Image” → “Overlay” → “From ROI Manager” (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]C), and save as usual.",
    "Critical: Keep in mind that the position of the signal in the kymograph corresponds to the time when the individual images were recorded. As the time axis goes from left to right, the lines representing detected IFT tracks are also oriented from left to right. In turn, the tracks going from the base of the cilium (bottom of the kymograph) to the tip of the cilium (top of the kymograph) visualize the anterograde transport, while the tracks going from the tip to the base belong to the retrograde transport. The direction of drawing the straight lines in the kymograph is critical for the correct calculation of IFT trains' velocity. Therefore, the individual lines need to be drawn in the proper direction: anterograde from the bottom of the kymograph; retrograde from the top of the kymograph; and in chronological order, i.e., from left to right (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]A).\nPause point: The subsequent determination of frequency and velocity of measured IFT trains can be done at any time.\nDetermination of frequency and velocity of IFT trains using mNeonGreen-IFT74:\nThe frequency of trains directly corresponds to the number of green (anterograde) and red (retrograde) lines per used period of time.\nCalculate the velocity of individual IFT trains:\nVelocity (μm/s) = tan(angle) ∗ pixel size ∗ frames per second\nNote: As mentioned earlier, the determined angle values for retrograde transport will be negative, which in this case reflects the fact the trains are moving in the opposite direction (to the anterograde transport). However, as velocity cannot be negative, simply use absolute values for its calculation in the case of the IFT trains moving via the retrograde route.\nNote: The used pixel size and number of frames can be determined in Fiji, click on Image → Properties (Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).",
    "Alternative: Imaging IFT transport using variable-angle epifluorescence (VAEM) microscopy\nExperiments focused on detailed study of IFT train trajectories require high time resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. If these parameters are critical, wide-field techniques such as TIRF microscopy can be a preferred alternative to confocal microscopy. TIRF microscopy uses critical angle illumination, where incident light is totally internally reflected at the glass-sample interface and only ∼300 nm deep evanescent field penetrates into the sample (Martin-Fernandez et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). This way, most of the background fluorescence is suppressed and contrast sufficient to image single molecules is achieved in the illuminated part of the cells. Most primary cilia are, unfortunately, located in cells such that they are out of the range of a true TIRF microscopy. However, modifications of the TIRF microscopy, sometimes referred to as “pseudo TIRF”, such as highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) or variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM) can be used to illuminate fluorophores deeper in the sample while still gaining significant improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (Tokunaga et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]) (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]). VAEM illuminates a sample at a sub-critical angle, at which light does not undergo total internal reflection, but enters the sample at a high inclination. It can be set up on any microscope equipped with a TIRF condenser. Here we demonstrate its use to visualize IFT in primary cilia with high time resolution.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. Comparison of epifluorescence microscopy (left) and VAEM (right)\nA cilium is marked with an arrow. Note the difference in the background fluorescence signal. Scale bar=10 μm.",
    "We use an inverted widefield microscope Nikon Eclipse Ti-E equipped with a motorized XY stage, Perfect Focus System, H-TIRF module, Nikon CFI Apo TIRF 60× Oil NA 1.4 objective, 488 nm laser diode illumination and Quad Band Filter Set 405/488/561/640 nm (TRF89901, Chroma). Temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration were maintained by module for environmental control (Okolab). Images were recorded by an EMCCD Andor iXon Ultra DU888 camera (Andor Technologies) with 1024 × 1024 sensor format, 13 μm × 13 μm pixel size and 16-bit bit depth, controlled by NIS elements Ar 5.02 software.\nPrepare ciliated hTERT-RPE-1 cells with mNeonGreen-IFT74 marker as described in previous sections.\nSwitch on the microscope, camera, and 488 nm laser illumination.\nInstall the objective-heating collar and environmental control stage insert, allow at least 20 min for the temperature, CO2 and humidity to stabilize before inserting the sample (see step 18 in the previous section).\nStart the NIS Elements software.\nApply immersion oil to the objective, insert a glass bottom dish with the cells and switch on the “Perfect Focus” system. As the glass/buffer interface has not been detected yet, the “Perfect Focus” button on the microscope will be flashing green.\nSlowly raise the objective until the immersion oil makes contact with the glass bottom of the dish. Keep raising the objective until the microscope emits a beep and the “Perfect Focus” button stops flashing. This means that the glass/buffer interface has been detected and the “Perfect Focus” is now in control of the objective-sample distance. The focusing knobs on the microscope are no longer active and focus adjustments must be made through the offset control wheel of the “Perfect Focus” system.",
    "Switch on 488 nm laser illumination, start “Live” acquisition in NIS Elements, and position the sample to have at least one cilium in the field of view.\nYou need to set up one microscope configuration with a low laser power for sample screening and another one with a higher laser power for acquisition. There are three main parameters to set (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]): (a) exposure time, (b) illumination angle, and (c) laser power, and optionally also (d) region of interest. Signal-to-background ratio above 1.5 (typically 1,500 gray value background and 2,250 gray value IFT fluorescence) allows reliable tracking of IFT trains, therefore it should be the minimum target for high laser power acquisition.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig13.jpg\nFigure 13. Imaging settings for VAEM, step 62\n(A) Exposure time (B) Illumination angle. X and Y sliders set the position of a focused laser beam at the back focal plane of the objective, determining the angle at which light enters the sample. Zero position (shown here) places the beam at the center of the back focal plane, which leads to conventional epifluorescence illumination. Position above 55,000 displaces the beam enough to generate TIRF illumination. (C) Laser intensity setting (D) Region of interest setting.\nExposure time will be determined by the experimental question. The minimum time we use is 10 ms. Using shorter exposure times does not improve the time resolution much, but reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly. Select an appropriate value in the “DU-888 Settings” window (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]A).",
    "Illumination angle needs to be adjusted for each experiment individually. The position of cilia in individual cells varies, which affects their distance from the glass surface. Hence, the optimal illumination angle also varies and needs to be determined empirically. We recommend adjusting the angle each time the sample dish is replaced, or a dish is moved by a significant distance (more than 2 mm). The illumination angle is set by moving the beam position in X and Y in the “Lapp H-TIRF XY-F Pad” window (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]B). When both values are set to 0, the microscope is in epifluorescence mode.\nNote: To find an optimal illumination angle, first determine the critical angle of a true TIRF illumination. At the critical angle, no cilia will be visible, only the cell regions in direct contact with the glass surface. Subsequently, reduce the angle step-by-step towards the epi-illumination mode until cilia start to be visible. Stop when the signal from the ciliary marker starts to be eclipsed by the fluorescence background. As the cilium in focus is partially bleached at this point, move to a different field of view and verify that the signal-to-background ratio is at its optimal level.\nNote: The illumination angle will not be consistent across the entire field of view and the optimization and subsequent acquisition should be performed in the same region (usually center) of the field of view.\nWe typically use laser power of 50%–75% for no more than 40 s of acquisition. When screening samples the laser power should be set to the lowest level which allows localizing the cilia (e.g., 10%) (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]C).",
    "Note: The laser power increases both the signal-to-noise ratio and cell damage significantly and should be set with respect to the intended duration of the acquisition. Several experimental movies should be recorded first to determine if there is significant bleaching of the fluorophores or cell damage (recognizable by IFT trains slowing down) during the recording.\nThe full field of view of our camera is 1024 × 1024 pixels (88 μm2 with our optical setup), which can accommodate several cells and cilia.\nOptional: While imaging multiple cells at once can be an advantage, recording full-frame movies comes with significant time overhead in addition to the selected exposure time and reduces the resulting frame rate. For very fast single cilium acquisitions, check “ROI” box at the “DU-888 Settings” panel (Figure 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig13]D) and using “ROI size / Define ROI” define the region of interest of 128 × 128 pixels (resulting in a 11 × 11 μm field of view with our setup).\nOnce the desired parameters are set for the screening configuration:\nCreate a button (Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]) for a new configuration in the OC panel, preferably by duplicating an existing TIRF configuration,\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig14.jpg\nFigure 14. Selection of optical configuration, step 63\nHighlighted button sets up the high-power illumination configuration. Right-click on the button offers the option “Assign current microscope settings” to update the configuration.\nright-click on it and choose “Assign current microscope settings”.\nThen change the microscope settings to the desired acquisition configuration,\nagain create a new button,\nright-click on it and choose “Assign current microscope settings”.\nDefine the experiment flow in the “ND Acquisition” window. For a simple time-lapse experiment, two variables need to be defined: time and optical configuration (Figure 15[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig15]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1464-Fig15.jpg\nFigure 15. Setting up an experiment acquisition, step 64",
    "In the “Time” panel, select one phase with interval option “No delay”. In the “Lambda” panel select one optical configuration and set to the high-power illumination configuration.\nIn the “Time” panel, check “Phase 1” only, set “Interval” to “No Delay” and “Duration” to the desired value.\nIn the “Lambda” panel, check the first “Opt. Conf.” option and set it to the optical configuration prepared for acquisition. Set the path for saving movies and appropriate filename base. Software will automatically add incrementing numbers to the filename base if multiple movies are recorded in the same experiment.\nSwitch to the low-power screening configuration and start searching for a suitable cilium to image. Once found, move it to the center of the field of view and bring it into focus with the “Perfect Focus” offset control. If you are using the region of interest option, switch on the “ROI” in the “Camera panel” and reposition the cilium to be fully contained in the visible area.\nPress the “Run now” button in the “ND Acquisition” window. The optical configuration will switch to the high-power illumination configuration and the movie is recorded.\nCritical: Time spent on previewing the cell and switching from searching to acquisition should be kept to a minimum to prevent cell damage and photobleaching. It is a good practice to organize the microscope workplace and software layout to have all necessary knobs and buttons at an easy reach.\nSwitch back to the low-power screening configuration and repeat the process with more cilia.\nOptional: Review the recorded movie using NIS elements or Fiji to ascertain that the image quality is satisfactory."
