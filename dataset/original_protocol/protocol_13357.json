    "All laparoscopic surgical procedures and postoperative treatments in this study were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the Laparoscopic Operation Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, China. The research protocol and content were explained to all patients, and informed consent was obtained. This study was conducted under the guidance of the ethics committee of the hospital.\n1. Case inclusion criteria\nInclude patients who have been diagnosed with sigmoid colon or high rectal adenocarcinoma (10-15 cm from the anus), who have undergone single-surgeon, three-port laparoscopy with NOSES in the study. Adopt the following inclusion criteria:\n\t\nEnsure diagnosis of sigmoid colon or high rectal adenocarcinoma by preoperative colonoscopy and pathological examinations.\nEnsure that enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests do not reveal any tumor invasion into the surrounding tissues, or bowel obstruction due to distant metastasis.\nEnsure that the tumor circumference is <5 cm.\nEnsure the T stage is ≤T4a.\nEnsure that the patients have no major organ diseases and can tolerate surgical treatment.\nEnsure that the patients do not have excessive obesity or mesenteric hypertrophy (BMI < 35 kg/m2).\nEnsure that the patients have not undergone any previous abdominal surgery and do not have pelvic floor adhesions.\n2. Preparation for surgery\nAdminister oral laxatives and slag-free semi-liquid or liquid food and oral compound polyethylene glycol electrolyte powder (137.12 g) 3 days before the operation to prepare the patients for intestinal surgery.\nPerform an enema the night before and early in the morning of surgery.\nPlace the patient in a modified lithotomy position, with the head lowered 15°-20° and the body tilted 15° on the right side.\n3. Surgical procedure",
    "To perform the three-hole trocar insertion, make a 10 mm incision below the umbilicus and insert a 10 mm trocar. Insert a 12 mm trocar into a 12 mm incision above the line connecting the right umbilicus and the anterior superior iliac spine. Next, insert a 5 mm trocar into a 5 mm incision above the right flat umbilicus. These latter two holes are considered the operating holes.\nAfter a routine inspection of the abdominal cavity, examine the upper abdominal liver and diaphragmatic peritoneum and check the abdominal cavity counterclockwise. Probe the location of the tumor and adjacent structures. Use anastomosis needles to suspend the uterus (in female patients) to the front of the abdominal wall to expand the surgical field, assist single-surgeon operation, and facilitate the removal of specimens through the vagina and insertion of the stapler seat.\nDissociate the sigmoid colon and its mesentery, usually done by releasing the left lateral side first, or use a medial dissociation approach, to expose the dissection plane between the Toldt and Gerota fascia.\n\tNOTE: However, due to mesangial hypertrophy or lack of help from an assistant, fully exposing the operating field may be challenging. Therefore, the lateral separation approach was preferred in this study.",
    "Enlarge the cephalic space of Toldt and ligate the inferior mesenteric artery and vein. After releasing the lateral side of the sigmoid mesocolon, adopt the medial approach. Next, lift the mesentery with gastric forceps to expose the mesenteric junction, dissociating it from bottom to top until the horizontal segment of the duodenum is reached, including the dissection of lymph nodes in 253 and 216 groups. After exposing the inferior mesenteric artery, ligate the vessels to expand the Toldt's space until the lower part of the pancreas is reached, and then ligate the inferior mesenteric vein at a high position.\nExpand the Toldt's space caudally and pull the inferior mesangium up freely. Pay attention to the movements of the left hand: perform micro-external rotation of the intestinal forceps and pull the proximal colon backward and upward. Expose the hypogastric nerve while protecting it under appropriate tension. After adequate separation of the mesentery, according to the distance from the tumor site, separate the mesentery below the rectum for excision, resulting in a naked intestine.\n\tNOTE: Since the lateral mesentery is dissociated first, when the inferior mesentery is released, the sigmoid colon can be lifted smoothly using gastric forceps, properly exposing to show the tension.\nTo determine the extent of bowel resection, first prepare an 8-10 cm length of silk thread in vitro, and mark the position of the proximal resection of the intestinal tube with the silk thread on the upper edge of the tumor. Dissociate the proximal bowel canal and expose it using an ultrasonic scalpel. Use an endoscopic linear cut stapler to sequentially transect the proximal and distal ends of the naked intestinal tube.\nInsertion of the stapler anvil seat and specimen removal",
    "Ensure that the distal rectal stump is flushed when removing the specimen from the rectum. Incise the distal rectal stump and place a clean endoscopic gauze under it to prevent contamination of the surgical field.\nWhen the specimen is taken out from the vagina, have the assistant irrigate the vagina, and then insert an intestinal pressure plate. Next, make a 3-4 cm incision in the vagina under the guidance of the intestinal pressure plate. Repeatedly disinfect the rectum or vagina with iodophor gauze.\nInsert a specimen bag into the abdominal cavity through the 12 mm trocar as protection during specimen retrieval to prevent tumor seeding or contamination of the rectum or vagina. During this process, place the staple anvil first and then take out the specimen to avoid possible contamination of the staple anvil.\nSutures of the vaginal wall and rectal stump\n\t\nSuture the vaginal wall directly with 3-0 antibacterial polydioxanone. After the rectal stump is sutured, lift the thread and close the rectal stump again with an endoluminal cutting and closure device to avoid the possibility of contamination and anastomotic leakage.\nPlacement of the stapler seat into the proximal bowel\n\t\nIncise the proximal intestinal canal, enlarge a 2-3 cm incision, and routinely sterilize it with iodophor gauze. Place an anvil and suture the intestinal canal without knots with 3-0 polyglactin.\nBowel anastomosis and reinforced stitching\n\t\nPerform routine end-to-end anastomosis of the bowel through the anus. Insert the ring stapler trigger handle through the anus, pierce the center piercing device of the stapler trigger handle, connect the center rod of the proximal stapler to the nail seat, and rotate the intestinal wall near the proximal and distal ends.\nPress the anastomotic wrench tightly to complete the cutting and anastomosis.",
    "Suture the full circumference of the anastomosis in a 4-0 knot-free pattern.\nFlush the abdominal cavity, place a drainage tube, and place a rubber tube on the left or right side of the pelvis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
