This expansion protocol enables higher cell numbers and a highly enriched population of MR1T cells at the end of culture, overcoming the challenge of resource limitations, including the need for large amounts of primary bat immune cells.\nCritical: Viability of bat cells tends to be low. Thaw a few vials from multiple bats as a backup.\nNote: This protocol is adapted from a human MAIT cell expansion protocol (Boulouis et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The overall timeline representation of Part I is depicted in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/665-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Timeline of the staining process for flow-cytometry-based analysis\nInitiation of primary culture from cryopreserved bat cells\nThawing of primary bat cells\nThaw cryovials in a water bath set at 37°C until a small piece of ice is left.\nTransport cryovials into biosafety cabinet class-II (BSC-II) on wet ice.\nCritical: Practice aseptic technique, keep everything sterile and work in a BSC-II from this step onwards.\nIn BSC-II, transfer cells into a sterile 50 mL falcon tube.\nAdd cold (2°C–8°C) R10 medium dropwise onto cells. Swirl tube to mix as media is being added. Mix well.\nNote: This thawing step describes thawing of 107 cells/mL. For every 1 mL of cells, add 10 mL of media. Scale proportion of media and buffers accordingly.\nCentrifuge tube at 390 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant into diluted (10%) bleach. Resuspend cells with 10 mL of cold PBS. Centrifuge tube at 390 x g for 5 min at 4°C. Repeat step twice for a total of 3× PBS washes.",
    "Resuspend pellet in 1 mL cold R10 medium and allow cells to recover at 23°C–25°C for 30 min.\nPerform cell count by Trypan Blue exclusion. (Troubleshooting - Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1])\nCritical: Keep reagents on ice and centrifuge cold at 4°C. Wash out DMSO thoroughly to minimize DMSO toxicity on bat immune cells. This recovery step is critical before culturing.\nCulturing primary bat MR1T cells\nWash the cells by adding 10 mL PBS to cells, mix well and centrifuge tube at 390 x g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant by inverting the tube and pipette out any excess residual liquid. Resuspend cells in complete expansion media (IC expansion medium (2× cytokines) diluted with base IC culture medium at 1:1 ratio), at 5 × 106 cells/mL.\nAdd 5-OP-RU to final concentration of 10 nM (x1000 dilution). Mix well and plate cells onto sterile 96-well U-bottom plate, at 200 μL per well (106 cells/well).\nIncubate cells at 37°C in the 5% CO2 incubator.\nReplace half volume of media with IC expansion medium (2×cytokines), every 2 days by pipetting out half volume of media and add back the equivalent volume. Mix well. If cells are accidentally disturbed during the media change, centrifuge supernatant and resuspend pellet with equivalent volume of fresh media before adding back to the wells.\nAdd 5-OP-RU at final concentration of 10 nM to cells on day 5 and 10.\nRecover viable cells with Ficoll density gradient centrifugation as described (Dias et al., 2017b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) on day 11 .(Troubleshooting - Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nCritical: 5-OP-RU degrades rapidly upon exposure to aqueous solution. Only add into culture media immediately before the intended experiments (within 2 min). Preferably work in a darkened BSC-II. We recommend titrating 5-OP-RU to determine the optimal concentrations for your experimental set-up.",
    "Staining cells and flow-cytometry-based analysis on day 0, 10, and 14 post-culture\nNote: This staining step is for routine monitoring of expanded culture.\nNote: This is the most basic staining cocktail for Pa MR1T cell identification.\nTransfer 106 cells into a 96-well V-bottom plate.\nWash once with 200 μL FACS buffer. Spin at 390 × g, 5 min at 4°C. Discard supernatant by pipetting.\n(Blocking) Add 50 μL of 10% FCS or if available, 10% bat serum diluted in FACS buffer to block cells for 30 min at 4°C. Additionally, pre-block cells with human (h)MR1-6-FP fluorescent-conjugated tetramer diluted in FACS buffer for 40 min at 4°C.\nNote: Initial pre-blocking experiments are recommended to determine the binding specificity of hMR1-5-OP-RU tetramer to pteropid MR1T cells (Leeansyah et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Once this has been determined in your experimental set-up, the pre-blocking step may be omitted. We previously showed that hMR1-5-OP-RU tetramer binds with high specificity to Pa MR1T cells (Leeansyah et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). By contrast, through pre-blocking experiments with hMR1-5-OP-RU tetramer, we showed that hMR1-6-FP tetramer bind weakly and with low specificity to Pa MR1T cells (Leeansyah et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nWash cells with 150 μL FACS buffer.

(Refer to Materials and Equipment)\nExport files as Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) 3.0.\nAnalyze files using flow-cytometry-based analysis software such as FlowJo.\nPart II: Functional analysis—cytotoxicity\nTiming: ∼3 days\nNote: This part is the continuation of Part I and should be planned accordingly. The overall timeline representation of Part II is depicted in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. The suggested experimental layout is outlined in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/665-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Plate layout for the Pa MR1T cell cytotoxicity assay\nThe second part of this protocol is used to examine the cytotoxic potential of the cultured MR1T cells by measuring apoptosis or cell death of cognate antigen-pulsed target cells.",
    "Target cell lines are pulsed with synthetic MR1 ligand 5-OP-RU or riboflavin biosynthesis proficient E. coli, producing these MR1 ligands. Target cells presenting cognate MAIT cell antigens on the MR1 molecule are recognized and killed by the expanded MR1T cells as effector cells, via the release of cytolytic granules such as perforin (Leeansyah et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Because MR1 is highly conserved in eutherian mammals, functional cross-reactivity has been observed between pteropid MR1T cells to human MR1 (Leeansyah et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Thus, cell lines of both pteropid bat and human origins can be used to assess pteropid MR1T cell cytotoxic capacity.\nMR1 antigen/bacterial-pulsing of target cell lines (PaKi, HEK293T-MR1, HeLa) (-3.5 h)\n(∼18 h before experiment) Seed cells at 5 × 104 cells per well in 200 μL cell culture media (Media and reagents preparation, point 2), into a 96-well flat bottom plate 18 h before assay.\nOn the day of experiment: harvest cells from three representative wells and count cells.

A time-kinetic study is also recommended to identify the best timing for capturing maximum target cell killing, e.g., 3, 6, 12 h. If human cell lines are used as target cells, MR1-dependency of MR1T cell cytotoxicity can be determined by using a blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human MR1 (Leeansyah et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), clone 26.5 (Biolegend, catalog No. 361103) (Huang et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). No blocking mAb against pteropid MR1 is commercially available at present.",
    "Pause Point: Effector cells for 0-h control can be kept at 4°C and stained together at the assay’s endpoint. Fixed bacteria can be kept on ice for up to 2 hours if cells are not ready. Cytotoxicity assay can be done with expanded cells between day 15–18. Stain expanded culture 1 day before the assay to determine purity of effector cells, which may guide adjustment of the required E:T ratio (Dias et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Flow-cytometry-based acquisition of stained cells should be done immediately if possible, or the samples can be stored protected from light at 40C for up to 24 h. Due to the cell number limitations, we recommend users to acquire as many cells as possible.\nPart III: Functional analysis—cytokine production\nTiming: ∼2 days\nNote: This part is the continuation of Part I and should be planned accordingly.

The assay may give insights on how pteropid MR1T cells would orchestrate downstream immune responses via the production of cytokines.",
    "Freshly-thawed autologous bat immune cells will need to be supplied as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as the expansion procedure depletes the APCs originally contained at the beginning of the expansion culture (Leeansyah et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). These added autologous APCs will take up the cognate antigens and present them to the expanded Pa MR1T cells. Due to the lack of pteropid bat-specific reagents, we were able to verify only two cytokines that can be readily detected by using the reagents listed in this Protocol: tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-17.\nThis assay also allows examination of IL-17 and TNF production by freshly-thawed (non-expanded) bat primary immune cells.\nPreparation of autologous APCs (−4.5 h)\nThaw cells as described above and determine cell number (Refer to Part I, point 1a).\nSeed cells at 5 × 104 cells per well in 90 μL into a sterile 96-well U-bottom plate in R10 medium.

    "Discard supernatant by pipetting. Wash with 200 μL 1×BD TF perm wash to remove remaining fixative. Spin at 757 × g, 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant by pipetting. Spin at 757× g, 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove remaining excess residual liquid by pipetting.\n(Intracellular/intranuclear staining) Stain cells with 50 μL intracellular staining cocktail containing anti-CD3ε, and (optional) anti-T-bet, anti-Eomes, anti-PLZF, and anti-RORγt antibodies in 1× BD TF perm wash for 40 min at 4°C, in dark.\nWash cells with 150 μL 1× BD TF perm wash. Spin at 757× g, 5 min at 4°C. Discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL FACS buffer.\nTransfer cells to FACS tubes. Store tubes in dark at 4°C until acquisition.\nAcquire cells on a flow cytometer. (Refer to Materials and Equipment).\nCritical: 5-OP-RU degrades rapidly upon exposure to aqueous solution and Ac-6-FP may be sensitive to light. Only add 5-OP-RU into culture media immediately before the intended experiments (within 2 min). Preferably work in a darkened BSC-II. We recommend titrating 5-OP-RU, Ac-6-FP, and the bacterial dose (i.e., CFU/cell) to determine the optimal concentrations for your experimental set-up. Minimize light exposure when working with CTV-labelled cells. If possible, also set apart ∼106 unlabeled and CTV-labeled cells and culture in IC culture media throughout the culturing experiment; they can be used to set up compensation matrix and as a fluorescence minus one (FMO) control on the day of the assay.\nPause Point: Flow-cytometry-based acquisition of stained cells should be done immediately if possible, or the samples can be stored protected from light at 40C for up to 24 h."
