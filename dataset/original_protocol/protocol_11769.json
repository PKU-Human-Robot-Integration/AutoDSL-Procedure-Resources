    "All experiments have complied with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80023, revised 1978). The procedure was approved with IACUC protocol #2016-0068 by the Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation\nTo mate age-matched wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice, place them in the same cage at 6:00 p.m. and separate them at 9:00 a.m. the next day.\nTo determine embryonic day 0 (E0), look at the vaginal plug, which has a homogeneous outer zone attached to the vaginal wall and an inner zone that is fibrous and includes some spermatozoa that form entangled masses mixed with the fibers of the plug material.\nRecord the weight of the mice at the time of mating.\nRe-weigh the mice on E10 to ensure ongoing pregnancy.\nPerform the surgery on E16.5 (early canalicular stage).\nSterilize the instruments that are going to be used during surgery: scissors, needle holder, forceps, clamps, and surgical knives and handles.\nPre-heat the surgery platform to 24 °C and prepare warm saline (24 °C) prior to surgery.\nCreate a warm environment for recovery, and leave wet food inside the cage for the early feeding.\nStay with the operated animals until they can feed themselves.\nKeep the operated mice alone in their individual cages after the surgery.\n2. Anesthesia\nApply subcutaneous 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine to the pregnant dams 1 h before the procedure.\nUse inhaled 5 mL/h of isoflurane for induction and 2 mL/h continuously during the procedure for anesthesia.\nMonitor the movements of the chins of the pregnant mice.\n3. Laparotomy\nClean the abdominal surface with alcohol and povidone-iodine. Maintain sterile conditions throughout the operation.\nPerform a vertical incision for the laparotomy of pregnant dams. Cut all layers separately.",
    "Identify uterine horns on each side.\nDetermine the candidate fetuses for the surgery.\n\tNOTE: Do not operate on the fetuses that are the nearest to the vagina.\nOperate on two fetuses in each uterine horn if there are an even number of fetuses on each side (4 most of the time), and on 1 fetus in each uterine horn if there are an odd number of the uterus(3 most of the time).\n4. Tracheal occlusion\nUse 2.5x magnification glasses for visualization.\nPosition the uterine horn in a transverse fashion.\nTake the pups, facing upward, between two fingers using the eyes of the pups and the tail as a guide to position the fetus.\nApply gentle pressure to the pup's head to allow extension of the head and therefore, visualization of the neck.\nUse a 6.0 polypropylene suture with an atraumatic needle to perform TO (Figure 1). Keep the placenta on the side and far from the entrance and exit points of the needle.\nInsert the needle transversely through the side of the uterus away from the placenta through the 1/3rd anterior part of the neck.\nMove the needle gently until the midline of the neck and direct it to the anterior part, then exit the neck between the trachea and opposite the carotid sheath and uterus.\nKnot the suture, taking care to maintain the integrity of the membranes and uterine wall, and keep the umbilical cord safe during knotting.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61772/61772fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Tracheal occlusion. (A) The transuterine suture passing through the neck.

Abdominal wall closure",
    "Replace the uterine horn in the abdomen.\nInject 2 mL of warm sterile saline into the peritoneal cavity before closure.\nPut a running 5/0 polyglactin suture to close the abdominal wall, and close the skin with a non-running silk suture.\nApply 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine intraperitoneally for analgesia, and allow the recovery of the dam in a warm incubator.\n6. Harvest\nApply anesthesia to the pregnant dam, and harvest all fetuses at E18.5 by cesarean section.\nCheck the viability of the fetuses by watching the movements of the fetuses.\nUse at least two different techniques for the euthanasia: carbon dioxide insufflation and cervical dislocation.\nRemove the bodies per the regulation of veterinary laboratory.\nWeigh all fetuses.\nPerform a vertical incision on the thorax for thoracotomy to remove the lungs.\nDissect the lungs of embryos, and weigh them to calculate total lung to body weight ratio (LBWR = (left lung weight + right lung weight)/body weight x100).\n7. Histology\nSnap-freeze the tissues in liquid nitrogen, optimal cutting temperature compound, and dry ice.\nCut the samples in 10 µm sections using a cryostat, and mount them on poly-lysine-coated slides.\nBake the slides at 60 °C overnight, and stain the baked slides with hematoxylin and eosin before mounting them for image acquisition at 10-20x magnification using a widefield microscope.\n8. Tissue processing for protein and DNA analyses\nSnap-freeze the dissected fetal lungs, and homogenize them in 300 µL of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min at 18,000 × g.\nExtract and quantify protein, DNA, and RNA10,12.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
