    "Assessing survival of wild-type and mutant yeast cells by spot assayStreak wild-type and mutant yeast strains (Table 1) to single colonies on YPD plates. Incubate for 2 days at 30 °C.Using a sterile toothpick, select individual wild-type, and mutant colonies. Resuspend the colony in 100 µl YPD in a centrifuge tube. Measure the OD600 using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop 2000c) and calculate to determine the volume required to achieve a final cell concentration of OD600 equals 0.0006 in 30 ml YPD. Dilute this volume of culture into 30 ml YPD and grow overnight (~16-18 h for a colony from a plate stored at 4 °C, or ~12-14 h for a colony from a plate coming from the 30 °C incubator) to mid-log phase (OD600 ~0.4-0.5) at 30 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. Measure the OD600 of the cultures. Determine the volume of culture equivalent to ~12 OD600 units. For example, 12 OD600 units of a culture with an OD600 of 0.5 equals 24 ml culture (divide 12 by 0.5). Transfer the calculated volume to a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 3,900 x g for 3 min. Remove supernatant, and resuspend cells in 20 ml pre-warmed YPD.Mix cultures well by vortexing, and add 10 ml of culture to two sterile flasks for each strain being tested.To one of the flasks, add H2O2 to 4 mM final concentration in 10 ml culture. Commercially-available H2O2 is usually 30% (w/w), density of 1.1 g/ml, and has a molecular weight of 34.01 g/mol. Therefore, the stock concentration is 9.79 M, and 4.08 µl of the stock gives a final concentration of 4 mM in a 10 ml culture volume.",
    "The calculation for determining the molarity of the stock solution is shown below:Stock solution: 30 g of H2O2 per 100 g H2O 100 g H2O/1.1 g/ml = 90.9 ml of solution for 30 g H2O2 (30 g H2O2/90.9 ml) x 100 = 33.3 g H2O2 in 100 ml H2O33.3 g H2O2/34.01 g/mol = 0.979 mol in 100 ml = 9.79 MPlace all flasks in the shaker and continue incubating at 30 °C for 30 min.After the 30 min incubation, remove 1 ml from each culture and place in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,200 x g for 2 min. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml sterile, distilled water.Set up a 10-fold dilution series of cells in a 96-well plate. You will have a separate row of cells for each strain. In the first well, add 200 μl of undiluted cells. In the next five wells, add 180 μl of sterile water. For each strain, take 20 μl of the undiluted cells and add it to the next well (containing 180 μl of water) using a multichannel pipette. Pipet up and down to mix sample. Then take 20 μl of this dilution and add it to the next well. Pipet up and down to mix and transfer 20 μl to the next well. Repeat to finish the dilution series. Using a multichannel pipette, spot 5 μl from each well on to a YPD plate. Start with the most dilute samples and end with the undiluted samples. Let the spots dry on the plates, and then transfer to the incubator at 30 °C.Cells from untreated cultures should be visible by day 2, whereas cells from cultures treated with H2O2 may take up to 5 days to be visible.",
    "Take pictures of the plates every day on a black background with white light using a gel documentation or other imaging system. Representative images are shown in Figure 1.

This type of data corresponds to the experimental outline described in Procedure A.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190115/20190115182048_1792.jpgFigure 2. Flow-chart describing experimental outline for Procedure A. Many of the steps shown in the flow-chart are similar to those used in Procedure C, in which SET4 (or a gene of interest) is overexpressed. Assessing survival of wild-type and mutant yeast cells by counting colony forming units (cfu)Follow Steps A1-A2 to grow yeast strains, except grow only 10 ml of each culture instead of 30 ml. When the cultures have reached mid-log phase (OD600 ~0.4-0.5), remove 10 µl of each culture to perform serial dilutions, and follow Step B3 to treat the remaining culture with H2O2. While the culture is incubating (as described below), dilute the 10 µl into 990 µl sterile, distilled water, and then perform a second 1:100 serial dilution. Plate 100 µl of the diluted cells onto a YPD plate using a glass plate spreader, representing a 1:1 x 105 dilution (or a dilution factor, DF, of 105) of the original culture. While performing dilutions and plating cells, treat the cultures with H2O2 to 4 mM final concentration (4.08 μl of the H2O2 stock in the 10 ml culture volume). Continue shaking at 30 °C for 30 min.",
    "After the incubation, remove 10 µl of each culture and dilute once into 990 µl sterile, distilled water. Plate 100 µl of the diluted cells onto a YPD plate using a glass plate spreader, representing a 1:1 x 103 dilution (or a dilution factor, DF, of 103) of the original culture. Incubate the plates at 30 °C for 2 days. Count colonies on each of the plates and record values to calculate percent survival, as shown in Table 2 and described in the Data Analysis section. A flow-chart outlining the steps in this protocol is shown in Figure 3.  Table 2.

Flow-chart describing experimental outline for Procedure B. Many of the steps shown in the flow-chart are similar to those used in Procedure D, in which SET4 (or a gene of interest) is overexpressed. Assessing survival of yeast overexpression strains by spot assayFor testing survival of cells overexpressing a gene of interest, yeast strain yEG315 was used and transformed (Gietz and Schiestl, 2007) with the vector pMN3, which drives overexpression of a cloned gene in the presence of β-estradiol (strains and plasmids provided by Scott McIsaac; Table 1 [McIsaac et al., 2013]).Streak yeast containing the empty vector or overexpression vector onto SC-URA plates to single colonies. Incubate for 2 days at 30 °C.Pick a single colony using a sterile inoculating stick and inoculate 3 ml of SC-URA medium in a 15 ml glass culture tube and grow overnight with shaking at 30 °C. The next day, measure the OD600 using a spectrophotometer. Dilute the cultures to OD600 ~0.1-0.2 in 20 ml SC-URA medium.Freshly prepare 10 mM β-estradiol in ethanol. Further dilute to 0.1 mM in ethanol and add 1 µM β-estradiol to each culture.",
    "Incubate the cultures with shaking at 30 °C. Grow to mid-log phase (OD600 ~0.5-0.7; approximately 4-6 h).Measure the OD600 of the cultures and calculate the volume of culture equivalent to ~12 OD600 units, as described in Procedure A.Transfer the calculated volume to a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 3,900 x g for 3 min.Resuspend in 20 ml pre-warmed SC-URA medium.Swirl to mix cultures well, and remove 10 ml of culture to a new flask so that you have two flasks for each strain being tested. To one of the flasks, add H2O2 to 20 mM final concentration (20.43 µl of the H2O2 stock in the 10 ml culture volume).Place all flasks in the shaker and continue incubating at 30 °C for 30 min.After the 30 min incubation, remove 1 ml from each culture and place in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,200 x g for 2 min. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml sterile, distilled water. Follow Steps A10-A13 to set up 10-fold serial dilutions, spot cells on SC-URA plates, and take images of the plates after 2-3 days of growth at 30 °C. Assessing survival of yeast overexpression strains by counting colony forming units (cfu)Follow Steps C1-C4, except grow only 10 ml cultures in SC-URA (rather than 20 ml). Freshly prepare 10 mM β-estradiol in ethanol. Further dilute to 0.1 mM in ethanol and add 50 nM β-estradiol to each culture.When the cultures have reached mid-log phase (4-6 h at 30 °C; OD600 ~0.5-0.7), remove 10 µl of each culture and perform serial dilutions. Dilute the 10 µl into 990 µl sterile, distilled water, and perform a second 1:100 serial dilution.",
    "Plate 100 µl of the second dilution onto an SC-URA plate using a glass plate spreader, representing a 1:1 x 105 dilution of the original culture. While performing dilutions and plating cells, treat the cultures with a final concentration of 20 mM H2O2 (20.43 µl of the H2O2 stock in the 10 ml culture volume) for 30 min. Continue shaking at 30 °C.After the incubation, remove 10 µl of each culture and dilute once into 990 µl sterile, distilled water. Plate 100 µl of the diluted cells onto an SC-URA plate using a glass plate spreader, representing a 1:1 x 103 dilution of the original culture. Incubate the plates at 30 °C for 2 days.
