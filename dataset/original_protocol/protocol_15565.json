    "The four different mushroom variants described in this protocol were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Isolation of fungal β-glucans\nExtraction and isolation of soluble mushroom polysaccharides\n\tNOTE: Soluble mushroom polysaccharides (SMPs) were obtained according to the procedure schematically shown in Figure 1.\n\t\nGently rinse fresh P. ostreatus, P. djamor, H. erinaceus, and G. lucidum fruiting bodies (about 2,000 g/mushroom) in distilled water five times.\nDry the fruit bodies at 50 ± 2 °C in a conventional air-drying oven until a constant weight is reached (~24 h).\nGround the dried mushrooms in a blade mill, obtaining about 200 g of powder from each mushroom.\nSuspend 100 g of mushroom powder (MP) (P. ostreatus, P. djamor, H. erinaceus, and G. lucidum) in 1,000 mL of H2Od. Then, autoclave at 121 °C for 15 min, and finally leave at room temperature for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the resulting suspension at 6,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nDry the precipitate containing insoluble mushroom polysaccharides (IMPs) at 50 ± 2 °C in an air-drying oven for 24 h.\nDiscard the precipitate and keep the supernatant. Concentrate the supernatant 10 times in a rotary evaporator.\nPrecipitate the concentrate containing SMPs with ethanol (80% final concentration) at 4 °C overnight.\nCentrifuge the ethanol suspension at 6,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, retain the pellet (precipitate), and discard the supernatant with a pipette.\nWash the precipitate three times with 80% ethanol before dissolving it in H2Od (10% w/v). Adjust the pH to 6.5/7 and the temperature to 37 °C, and treat with 2 U and 4 U of α-amylase and glucoamylase, respectively, to solubilize α-glucans following the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials).",
    "After the treatment with α-amylase/glucoamylase, adjust the pH and temperature to 8.0 and 50 °C, respectively, and treat with alcalase (2.5 U/g of protein) (see Table of Materials) to solubilize the proteins.\n\t\tNOTE: This sequential enzymatic treatment removes most α-glucans and proteins that co-precipitate with β-glucans in the ethanol precipitation.\nAfter hydrolysis, centrifuge the hydrolysate at 6,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the clean supernatant concentrate five times in a rotary evaporator. Precipitate again with 80% ethanol.\nSolubilize the resulting precipitate in H2Od and dialyze in distilled water for 24 h using cellulose tubing membranes (12,000 Da cut-off membranes; see Table of Materials) to remove low molecular weight molecules. Recover the water-soluble portion and freeze-dry it to produce soluble β-glucans (SβGs).\nSugar and protein measurement\n\t\nMeasure the total sugar content of each fraction by the phenol-sulfuric acid method, using glucose as standard8.\n\t\tNOTE: Quantitation of β-glucan content may also be done by using the β-glucan assay kit (mushroom and yeast; see Table of Materials), based on enzymatic hydrolysis and the activity of oxidoreductases: namely exo-1,3-β-glucanase, glucose oxidase, β-glucosidase, and peroxidase, with the subsequent formation of the quinoneimine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, with slight modifications.\nUse 18 MH2SO4 instead of 12 MH2SO4.\nEvaluate the content of the total glucans and α-glucans separately.\nMeasure the resulting β-glucan values as the difference between the total glucan and α-glucan (triplicate) values following the Kjeldahl protocol. In certain cases, protein content can be determined by the Lowry method, using albumin to plot the calibration curve11,12.\nUltraviolet absorption spectroscopy analysis\n\t\nObtain the SβG ultraviolet (UV) spectra using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials) by scanning the samples in the 200-400 nm region (Figure 2).",
    "Prepare 1.0 mg/mL of each SβG in H2Od, transfer the solution to a quartz cuvette, and scan at room temperature.\nMolecular weight distribution analysis\n\t\nEstimate the homoegeneity of SβGs and molecular weight of polymers by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (see Table of Materials) equipped with a refractive index detector and an ultra-hydrogel linear gel-filtration column (300 mm x 7.8 mm; Figure 3).\nPerform the assay at 40 °C using deionized water as eluent at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min-1 and dextrans (110, 80, and 50 kDa) as standards (see Table of Materials). Collect a 5 mL fraction.\nFourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis\n\t\nRecord the infrared spectra (Figure 4) on an FTIR spectrometer in the range of 4000-500 cm-1. The samples should be previously mixed with KBr to form films (standard FTIR procedure; see manufacturer's instructions and Table of Materials).\nMolecular composition analysis\n\t\nEstimate the molecular compositions of SβGs by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) as well as gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), following standard procedures12.\n2. In vitro study of β-glucan-induced microglia stimulation\nCell culture of mouse glioblastoma and microglia cells in 8-well chamber slides\n\tNOTE: This protocol is specific for GL261 (glioblastoma) and BV2 (microglia) cell lines. However, with slight modifications, these steps could potentially be used to study other cancer and immune cell lines.\n\t\nPrepare Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) complete medium modified with L-glutamin, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, and without pyruvate. Add 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (see Table of Materials). Pre-warm the material in a water bath at 37 °C for 15 min.",
    "Thaw frozen BV2 and GL261 aliquots into a water bath (37 °C) for 2 min, and just before they completely thaw, carry them into a laminar flow hood and plate the cells into two different sterile T25 flasks (one for each cell line).\nIncubate the T25 flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 until the culture is confluent.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the freezing conditions and the time under cryopreservation, the time until confluence may vary. These cell lines usually require between 3 to 5 days to reach confluency in a T75 flask.\nAfter the BV2 cell culture becomes confluent, transfer it into 8-well chamber slides 0.6 x 106 cells/well. Keep the 8-well chamber slides in the incubator for 24 h.\nOnce the microglia cells are plated into the 8-well chamber slides, repeat the same protocol with the GL261 cells.\nActivation of microglia with β-glucans\n\t\nCoat the BV2 cells with four different β-glucans (P. ostreatus, P. djamor, G. lucidum, and H. erinaceus) at a 0.2 mg/mL concentration for 72 h. One experimental condition must remain untreated (normal medium), acting as the control group.\nCollect the supernatant with a pipette after 72 h and pass the remaining volume through a 0.20 µm syringe filter. Then, freeze the supernatant at -80 °C for at least 24 h.\nTreatment of GL261 with pre-activated microglia-conditioned medium\n\t\nOnce the GL261 is 80% confluent within the 8-well chamber slides, add β-glucan-treated microglial medium (step 2.2.2) at a final volume concentration of 25% for 72 h (total volume: 250 µl/well).\nRemove the medium after 72 h incubation and discard it.\nWash the cells with phosphate buffer saline (PBS; pH 7.4, 0.1 M) three times for 5 minutes.\nFix the cells by adding 200 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 °C for 15 min.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the different antibodies that might be used for immunofluorescence, fixation methods may differ from typical 4% PFA. Alcohol-based fixatives may be more efficient in preserving certain epitopes.\nImmunofluorescence study\n\t\nWash the samples with PBS with triton X (PBST; 0.01%) for 10 min three times.\nRemove the PBST and add bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking buffer 10% in PBST (Table 1) for 30 min at room temperature.\nRemove the blocking buffer and add 200 µL per well of PBS containing the primary antibodies mixture (1:500 rat Ki-67 monoclonal antibody and 1:500 rabbit cleaved caspase-3 antibody; see Table of Materials). Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nAfter 24 h of incubation at 4 °C, leave the samples at room temperature for 30 min.\nWash the wells three times for 10 min with PBS on a shaker (low speed).\nRemove the PBS and replace with 200 µL per well of PBS containing the mixture of secondary antibodies (1:200 donkey anti-rat IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 and 1:200 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 647; see Table of Materials) for 45 min at room temperature in the dark.\nWash the samples with PBS for 10 min on a multipurpose shaker.\nRemove the PBS and add 200 µL per well of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) diluted in PBS (1:5,000) for 1 min.\nRemove DAPI (see Table of materials) and wash the cells for 5 min in PBS.\nRemove the well frame and add 50 µL of PBS:glycerol (1:1) on each well and cover with a coverslip.\nSeal the slides with nail polish.\nAcquire images at 20x using a confocal microscope system (see Table of materials).\n3. Quantification and analysis of tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis",
    "NOTE: In order to measure the potential effect of the different β-glucans on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis, an in-house script was used in ImageJ software to quantify the number of positive pixels of Ki67 (proliferation) and cCasp3 (apoptosis)13.\nOpen ImageJ. Click on the Plugins button. Click on Coloc2, a plugin previously installed in the plugin folder, and finally select the image to analyze11.\n\tNOTE: This plugin was available following previous contact with Dr. Vasiliki Economopoulos (veconom@uwo.ca). Instead of the script, both ImageJ and Fiji software have different tools for colocalization analysis (see Table of materials), with similar properties.\nSet thresholds according to the control (untreated, DMEM only) conditions. Click on the OK button.\n\tNOTE: In order to avoid background and intensity discrepancies, all images must be taken under the same conditions. Preferably, imaging sessions should be performed on the same day, and microscope parameters unaltered across images.\nEnsure that the resulting images of the colocalized pixels and a summary window providing the percentage or raw number of pixels above the threshold pop up. Normalize the results with respect to the control (untreated) conditions.\n\tNOTE: All data are given as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using graphing and analysis software (see Table of Materials). A one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used. Errors are represented as standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
