    "1. Preparation of the Materials, Hydrogel, and Cell Culture Materials\nMaterial and solution preparation\nWash and dry 250 mL and 100 mL glass beakers, magnetic stirrers, spatulas, 10 mL cartridges, 25 G cylindrical nozzles (with a length of 0.5 in and an inner diameter of 250 µm). Sterilize the materials by autoclaving them at 121 °C/15 min/1 atm. Keep the materials under sterile conditions until use.\n\t\tNote: Refer to the Table of Materials for vendor information.\nWeigh 3 g of alginate (3% w/v) and 7 g of gelatin (7% w/v) (denoted as A3G7 hereafter).\nSterilize the following items under UV light for at least 4 h: alginate and gelatin powders, paraffin film, aluminum foil pieces of 5 cm2, and 1 mL and 5 mL syringes. Sterilize the end caps, tip caps, and pistons by immersing them in 70% ethanol for at least 4 h and wash them 2x with sterilized ultra-pure water.\n\t\tNote: Refer to the Table of Materials for vendor information.\nDissolve 4 g of agarose with ultra-pure water and sterilize it by autoclaving.\n\t\tNote: The agarose is completely dissolved after the autoclaving process.\nPrepare a 100 mM solution of anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2) in sterilized ultra-pure water and a sterile filter (with a pore size of 0.22 µm) prior to use.\nFor agarose-coated 6-well plates, melt the sterile agarose in a microwave to obtain a liquid solution; then, under a Biosafety Cabinet (BSC) and using a 1 mL micropipette, add 2 mL per well and mix it gently to create a uniform layer in the bottom of the well. Leave it to cool down and seal the well with paraffin film. Keep it at room temperature (RT) until use.\nPreparation of the A3G7 hydrogel precursor",
    "Mix 3 g of alginate and 7 g of gelatin powders into a 250 mL beaker within a BSC. Add a magnetic stirrer and 100 mL of DPBS. Seal the beaker with sterile paraffin film and aluminum foil (5 cm2) to avoid contamination.\nDissolve the powders under a constant agitation in a magnetic/hot plate with 600 rpm at 60 °C for 1 h and at RT for an extra 2 h.\nHeat the material at 37 °C until the gel undergoes a phase transition to the liquid state (for 100 mL of stock gel solution, this takes approximately 45 min). Transfer the solution into sterile 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes, seal them, and centrifuge the tubes at 834 x g for 5 min to eliminate any gas bubbles from the material.\nAspirate the hydrogel precursor into 10 mL syringes. Seal the syringes with caps and paraffin film. Store them at 4 °C until use.\nCell culture \n\tNote: The steps in this section must be performed under sterile conditions.\n\t\nPrepare the basal DMEM medium as follows (for 1 L): in a BSC, mix 100 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus 10 mL of an antibiotic/antimycotic solution (a 100x stabilized solution) into a fresh sterile container. Add DMEM medium to adjust the mixture up to 1,000 mL. Seal the container and keep it at 4 °C.\nIn a previously warmed water bath (37 °C), defrost 1 vial of MDA-MB-231-GFP (human breast cancer cell line GFP-labeled, nuclear localization) and 1 vial of IMR-90-mCherry (cancer-associated fibroblast cell lines mCherry-labeled, with cytoplasmic localization) cells from the liquid nitrogen storage by moving them gently into the water. Both cell lines, and the plasmids for GFP and mCherry labeling, are commercially available.",
    "Transfer 160 µL/well of cell solution (3 x 106 cell/mL) into a 6-well plate and add 5 mL of warmed (37 °C) basal DMEM medium. Incubate the plate at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 24 - 48 h until the cells reach 80% confluence.\nAfter the cells reach confluence, discard the medium and rinse the cells twice with DPBS; incubate the cells with 500 µL of trypsin-EDTA solution/well (0.25%, 1x, previously warmed at 37 °C) at 37 °C for 6 min. Then, inactivate the trypsin by adding 500 µL of FBS, recover the cell solution and transfer it to T-75 flasks. Incubate them again at 37 °C/5% CO2 until the cells reach 80% confluence.\n\t\tNote: The volume of trypsin-EDTA solution can vary depending on the cell-growth vessel.\nRepeat the previous step to work with cells on passage 3 - 4 as that is when cells have more metabolic activity and stability.\nCount the cells using a trypan blue assay (0.4%) to determine the initial concentration of cells to be mixed with the hydrogel.\n2. Measurements of Rheological Properties of Hydrogels\nPrepare the alginate/gelatin hydrogel precursor as described in step 1.2.\n\tNote: Sterile conditions are not required for samples generated for mechanical testing and analysis. All rheological tests are performed in triplicate.\nTake a syringe of the hydrogel precursor and warm it up in a 37 °C water bath for 1 h.\nTurn on the rheometer and initialize the system according to the following steps.\n\t\nTurn on the air compressor connected to the rheometer and let the air compressor run for 30 min.

Scaffold Design, Cell-laden Hydrogel, and 3D Printing Models\nScaffold design\nDraw a propeller-like model on paper.\n\t\tNote: The propeller-like model is designed based on the following considerations: (a) it simulates the in vivo scenario where cancer cells are surrounded by CAFs; (b) it minimizes the concentration of stress via the use of circular geometries; (c) it is flexible so that more sectors can be added into the model in the future without changing the existing geometries; and (d) it is flat in its vertical scale to facilitate nutrient diffusion.\nLet the center of the propeller be the origin and use the symbols R0, R1, and R2 to represent the maximal radius of the inner circle, middle sectors, and outer sectors, respectively. Use the symbols m and n to represent the number of internal arcs and spokes inside the sector area, respectively.",

Continue adding liquid nitrogen to avoid the hydrogel from defrosting. Transfer the powder into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, seal it, and store it at -80 °C for 2 h. Freeze-dry the sample for 24 h.\nFor spheroid imaging, wash the hydrogel gently with DPBS 2x, fix the cells by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C, and then rinse them with DPBS and freeze them with liquid nitrogen. Finally, freeze-dry the sample for 24 h.\nAnalyze the hydrogel/spheroid structure and morphology with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 25.0 kV, under 70 Pa (chamber pressure) with a magnification of 40X up to 5,000X.\nSubscription Required.
