    "1. Assembly and Alignment\nChoose a cantilever whose stiffness is appropriate for the intended experiment. Attach the LP to the cantilever using #4-40 socket head cap screws (SHCSs) (see Figure 3A). Take care to not plastically deform the cantilever arms while attaching the LP.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Procedure for assembling the cantilever force sensor and measuring its stiffness. (A) The load point (LP) is attached to the cantilever (C), with the load point tip (LPT) pointed upward. (B) The cantilever and LP subassembly is attached to the cantilever plate, denoted as CP. The recessed pocket of the cantilever plate is shown beneath the cantilever arms. (C) The cantilever plate is attached to the underside of the frame so that the side of the plate shown in (B) is facing the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq6.jpg direction. The FODS micrometer is denoted as FM. (D) The wire hook and calibration weights used in step 2 of the protocol are shown hanging from the hole in the LPT.

Inspect the mirror for scratches and replace the mirror if it is damaged.\nLoosely attach the cantilever to the cantilever plate using #6-32 SHCSs on the side of the plate containing the recessed pocket with the LPT pointing away from the plate (see Figure 3B). Insert the 1/8\" alignment pins through the cantilever and plate, tighten the screws, and then remove the alignment pins.",
    "Retract the FODS as much as possible by turning the FODS micrometer counter-clockwise (see Figure 3C). Loosely attach the cantilever plate to the frame using #6-32 SHCSs with the LPT pointing in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq4.jpg direction (see Figure 1A). Insert the 1/8\" alignment pins through the frame and cantilever plate, tighten the screws, and then remove the alignment pins (see Figure 3C).\nTurn on the power supply and set the voltage to 12.00 V in constant voltage mode using the adjustment knob. Then turn on the voltage output and confirm that the current draw displayed on the power supply's LCD screen is roughly 60-70 mA. Wait at least one hour for the current draw to reach steady state to reduce voltage measurement uncertainty.\nOpen and run the the Basic_Data program (see Supplementary Code files). Turn the FODS micrometer (see Figure 3C and Figure 4A) clockwise to move the FODS toward the LP mirror until the output voltage displayed on the user interface graph reaches a maximum value.\nAdjust the gain of the FODS by turning the set screws on the side of the FODS housing so that the voltage output is 5.0 V. Turn the FODS micrometer counter-clockwise to retract the FODS.\nTurn on the microscope illuminator and adjust the microscope position and focus using the two manual translation stages so that the LPT is centered in the field of view. Stop the Basic_Data program by clicking the 'Stop' button.\nOpen the motor controller user interface software. Use the potentiometer slider on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq5.jpg-axis motor controller to move the stage to the maximum allowable travel in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq6.jpg direction and set the home position by clicking the 'Home' button in the user interface.",
    "Use the potentiometer slider on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq7.jpg-axis motor controller to move the stage to the maximum allowable travel in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq8.jpg direction and set the home position. Close the user interface software.\nSeat the stage on the stage base plate (see Figure 4A) so that the tips of the micrometer heads on the leveling plate rest in the stage base plate divots. Place a bubble level on the isolation table and adjust the pressure in each of the table's legs by turning the valve arm thumb screws so that the surface is level.\nMove the bubble level to the top of the stage leveling plate and adjust the micrometers so that it is also level. Note the micrometer positions and remove the stage from the stage base plate. Note: The protocol can be paused here.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4: The mechanical testing device as assembled in steps 1.9 and 3.7 of the protocol. (A) The sample stage (SS), is attached to the translation stage (TS), and is leveled using the micrometers on the stage leveling plate (SLP), which are seated on the stage base plate (SBP). The stage base plate is attached to the optical breadboard of the isolation table. The cantilever (C); cantilever plate (CP); and fiber optic displacement sensor (FODS) compose the force sensing system. (B) The load point (LP) is attached to the cantilever and the load point tip (LPT) is positioned over the spicule on the sample stage. During a bending test, the displacement of the LP is measured using the FODS. The initial distance between the FODS and the LP mirror is controlled by the FODS micrometer (FM) shown in (A). (C) A micrograph of the spicule laying across the trench in the sample stage, positioned beneath the LPT. Scale bar = 250 µm (C).

Cantilever Stiffness Measurement\nRun the Basic_Data program and turn the FODS micrometer clockwise until the output voltage is approximately 4 V. Stop the program by clicking the 'Stop' button.\nMeasure the mass of the wire hook and calibration weights using an analytical balance.\nOpen the Cantilever_Calibration program (see Supplementary Code files) and enter the desired file name for the force calibration output file in the text box in the user interface.\nRun the Cantilever_Calibration program and click 'OK' when prompted to enter the mass of the first calibration weight. Wait for the output voltage displayed in the user interface graph to stop oscillating and click the green 'Voltage Stabilized' button to take a voltage measurement.",
    "Use tweezers to hang the wire hook from the hole in the LPT so that the hook is facing away from the microscope objective (see Figure 3D). Use the tweezers to damp the vibration of the cantilever caused by the addition of the hook.\nEnter the mass of the hook in grams in the dialog box and click 'OK'. As in the previous step, wait for the output voltage to stop oscillating before clicking the 'Voltage Stabilized' button.\nUse tweezers to hang the first weight on the wire hook and repeat the process of taking a voltage measurement as described in the previous step. Repeat this step until either all of the calibration weights have been hung or the output voltage is less than 1.8 V. At this point, click 'Cancel' in the dialog box to exit the Cantilever_Calibration program.\nTurn the FODS micrometer counter-clockwise to retract the FODS. Carefully remove the hook and weights from the LPT.\n\tNOTE: The force calibration output file is a tab delimited list of the force applied by the calibration masses, the mean of 100 FODS output voltage readings and the standard deviation of those readings. The Representative Results section describes how this data file is processed to measure the cantilever stiffness.\n3. Specimen Preparation\nWear nitrile gloves when handling the E. aspergillum sponge skeletons and store the skeletons in sealed containers when they are not being handled.\n\tCAUTION: Since the spicules are composed primarily of silica, broken spicule fragments are sharp and can become embedded in skin, leading to irritation.\nUse a pair of tweezers to grasp one anchor spicule by its distal end and pull to remove it from the skeleton (see Figure 2A). Place the spicule on a clean microscope slide.",
    "Hold the spicule against the slide near the midpoint along its length using a #00000 red sable brush. Cut a ≈4 mm section of the spicule by pushing a razor blade against the spicule on either side of the brush perpendicular to the slide surface (see Figure 2B). Discard the large distal and proximal spicule sections and keep the ≈4 mm section.\nInspect the 4-mm spicule section using a polarized light microscope at 10x magnification (see Figure 2C-E). Discard the spicule section and return to step 3.2 if it is missing large regions of silica layers (see Figure 2E). Handle inspected spicule sections exclusively using the #00000 red sable brush to avoid introducing any new damage to their silica layers.\nClean any spicule fragments or other particles from the surface of the sample stage with a brush or compressed air. Then apply a few drops of 2-propanol to a lint free cotton swab and wipe the sample stage. Avoid contact with the areas of the stage coated with non-reflective paint.Note: The paint is used to reduce the number of specular reflections in the images taken during the bending test.\nTransfer the spicule section to the sample stage. Position the spicule section across the trench with the desired span for the bending test and gently push it in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq10.jpg direction against the trench ridge. Ensure that the spicule is perpendicular to the trench edges (see Figure 2C).\nSeat the stage on the stage base plate so that the tips of the micrometer spindles rest in the stage base plate divots. If needed, adjust the micrometers on the stage leveling plate to the values noted in step 1.9 of the protocol.\n4. Voltage-displacement Interpolation File",
    "Open the Bending_Test program (see Supplementary Code files). Set the 'step size' to 2 µm, 'maximum displacement' to 0.5 mm, 'low voltage stop' to 1.5 V, and 'high voltage stop' to 4.6 V using the text boxes shown in the user interface.\nSelect the desired image and data directories and the output file name using the text boxes in the user interface. Set the 'save images' switch in the user interface to the down position and click the green rectangular button below the words 'Voltage Difference' so that it becomes illuminated.\nRun the Bending_Test program and wait for the motor controller and camera interfaces to initialize.\nTurn on the illuminator and adjust the brightness so that the LPT is visible. Turn the FODS micrometer clockwise until the output voltage displayed in the user interface graph is ~1.7 V.\nUse the potentiometer slider on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq5.jpg-axis motor controller to move the stage in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq1.jpg direction until it is ~1 cm below the LPT and set the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq5.jpg-axis home position by clicking the \"Home\" button.\nUse the potentiometer sliders on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq7.jpg- and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq11.jpg-axis motor controllers to position the LPT over the center of the thin steel strip located on the sample stage in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq12.jpg direction from the trench. Use the potentiometer slider on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq5.jpg-axis motor controller to move the stage in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq1.jpg direction until the stage is within the microscope's field of view.\nUse the potentiometer slider on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq5.jpg-axis motor controller to move the stage in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq1.jpg direction while watching the output voltage graph in the user interface. Determine the approximate position at which the LPT contacts the stage's surface by looking for a change in voltage with further movement of the stage. Retract the stage approximately 10 µm.",
    "Click the button labeled \"Begin Test\". When prompted, enter values of 0.003 V and 0.001 mm for 'touch sensitivity' and 'touch off step size', respectively. Wait for the test to complete.\n\tNOTE: After this point, do not remove the stage from the stage base plate until the bending test is complete in order to ensure accurate displacement measurements. The voltage-displacement interpolation output file is a tab delimited list of the mean of 100 FODS output voltage readings and the standard deviation of those readings along with the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq5.jpg-axis stage position at every stage displacement increment. The Representative Results section describes how this data file is used to convert measured FODS output voltages to LP displacements.\n5. Bending Test\nOpen and run the Basic_Data program and turn the FODS micrometer counter-clockwise until the output voltage displayed on the user interface graph is approximately 3 V. Use the potentiometer slider on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq7.jpg-axis motor controller to position the LPT between the trench edges above the spicule (see Figure 4C).\nUse the potentiometer slider on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq5.jpg-axis motor controller to move the stage in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq1.jpg direction until the LPT is below the top surface of the trench ridge (see Figure 5A). Finally, use the potentiometer slider on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq11.jpg-axis motor controller to bring the front surface of the trench ridge into focus so that the complete width of the LP is between the edges of the trench ridge. Stop the Basic_Data program by clicking the 'Stop' button.\nOpen and run the Center_LoadPoint program (see Supplementary Code file). Use the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq7.jpg-axis motor controller to move the stage until the LPT is nearly in contact with the right trench edge. Click the \"Find Edge\" button.",
    "When prompted, use the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq7.jpg-axis motor controller to move the stage until the LPT is nearly in contact with the left trench edge. Click the \"Find Edge\" button. Wait for the program to position the LPT mid-way across the trench span (see Figure 5B).\n\tNOTE: After this point it is important not to adjust the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq7.jpg-axis motor controller as this will result in a misalignment of the LPT.\nOpen the Bending_Test program. Set the step size to 2 µm, maximum displacement to 0.5 mm, low voltage stop to 1.5 V, and high voltage stop to 4.5 V using the text boxes in the user interface.\nSelect the desired image and data directories and the output file name using the text boxes in the user interface. Set the 'save images' switch in the user interface to the up position and click the green rectangular button below words 'Voltage Difference' so that it is not illuminated.\nRun the Bending_Test program and wait for the motor controller and camera interfaces to initialize.\nMove the stage in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq1.jpg direction using the potentiometer slider on the motor controller until the spicule is within the microscope's field of view. Use the potentiometer slider on the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq11.jpg-axis motor controller to move the stage until the spicule is under the LPT.\nAdjust the microscope focus knobs so that the spicule is in focus in the user interface (see Figure 4C). Turn the FODS micrometer counter-clockwise until the output voltage is approximately 1.8 V.",
    "Use the potentiometer slider on the z-axis motor controller to move the stage in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq1.jpg direction while watching the output voltage graph in the user interface. Determine the approximate position at which the LPT contacts the spicule by looking for a change in voltage with further movement of the stage. Retract the stage approximately 50 µm.\nClick \"Begin Test\" and wait until the bending test is completed and the stage returns to the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq5.jpg-axis home position.",
    "NOTE: The stage will move in 2 µm increments (as is prescribed in step 5.4 of the protocol) in the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq1.jpg direction, bending the spicule (see Figure 5C) until one of several stopping conditions is met. The stopping conditions are: a) the maximum stage displacement of 0.5 mm is reached; b) the spicule breaks and the program detects a large drop in the FODS output voltage; or c) the high voltage limit of 4.5 V is reached. For stopping condition (a), the user will be prompted if they would like to end the test or override the previous value. When 'Override' is selected, the user will have the opportunity to either increment the stage displacement limit or reverse the direction of the stage displacement step in order to continue collecting data as the spicule is unloaded. The stage displacement increment direction can also be changed by clicking the \"Reverse Loading\" button at any point during the test. The bending test output file has the same structure as the voltage-displacement interpolation output file generated in step 4.6 of the protocol. That is, it is a tab delimited list of the mean of 100 FODS output voltage readings and the standard deviation of those readings along with the imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571eq5.jpg-axis stage position at every stage displacement increment. The Representative Results section describes how this data file is used along with the voltage-displacement interpolation file to compute the cantilever displacements and stage displacements during the bending test. Subsequently, the cantilever stiffness is used to compute the force applied by the LPT on the spicule.\nAfter the test is complete, turn the FODS micrometer counter-clockwise until the FODS is at least 5 mm from the LPT mirror. Then, carefully remove the stage from the stage base plate.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56571/56571fig5.jpg",
