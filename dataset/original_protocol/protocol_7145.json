    "When utilizing cell lines that grow in suspension, skip Steps A1–A5 and start at Step A6.Preparation of mammalian cellsGrow adherent cells in sterile culture vessels (T-75 flask) in appropriate cell culture medium in a tissue culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) until they reach a confluency of 70–80%.Note: Given that for each time point and NBD-lipid, at least ~104 cells are required, a total of 3 × 106 cells were collected per lipid tested, which corresponded to three T-75 flask of CHO-K1 cells at a confluency of 70–80%. For other cell lines, growth conditions and confluency degrees might require adjustment. Remove media and wash cells twice with 5 mL of HBSS (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free, pre-warmed at 37°C).Add 1.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution (pre-warmed at 37°C) and incubate the T-75 flasks in a tissue culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity).After 5 min, check under the microscope if the cells have detached. If the cell line allows it, tap the flask in the side to help the detachment of the cells from the bottom.Note: Cells in suspension will show a round-shaped morphology. Stop trypsinization by adding 7.5 mL of appropriate cell culture medium (pre-warmed at 37°C).Note: For cells grown in suspension, Steps A1–A5 are omitted. Transfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL Falcon and set aside 50 µL of this in a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube for cell counting, e.g., using the hemocytometer (see below).Centrifuge cells in the 50 mL Falcon tube at 500 × g and room temperature for 10 min and discard the supernatant.Add 10 mL of TBSS buffer (see Recipes) at room temperature to the cell pellet, and resuspend completely by pipetting up and down.",
    "Note: This additional washing step ensures the removal of phenol red, a pH indicator present in DMEM media that interferes with the NBD-lipid fluorescence quantification. Centrifuge the cells in the 50 mL Falcon tube at 500 × g and room temperature for 10 min and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in TBSS buffer (see Recipes) to a final concentration of ~106 cells mL-1.To block the conversion of NBD-lipids by cellular phospholipases, add PMSF and OBAA to a final concentration of 1 mM and 5 µM, respectively, to the cell suspension.Gently mix and incubate at 20°C in a water bath placed in a cold room for 10 min. The assay is typically performed at 20°C or below to suppress endocytosis.Cell countingPrepare the hemocytometer by cleaning the chambers and coverslip with isopropanol. Dry the hemocytometer by using lint-free tissue. Place the glass cover slip over the counting chambers.Add 50 µL of 0.4% trypan blue stock solution to 50 µL of cell suspension (Step A6) to obtain a 1:1 dilution.Load the hemocytometer with 10 µL of cell suspension and examine immediately under an inverted phase contrast microscope at low magnification.Count the number of viable (seen as bright cells) and non-viable cells (stained blue) in the large outer quadrants.Calculate the percentage of viable cells: % viable cells = [1.00 – (Number of blue cells ÷ Number of total cells)] × 100. Cell viability should be at least 95%.Calculate the cell concentration, based on the premise that each square accounts for a volume of 10-4 mL of cell suspension.To obtain the total number of viable cells per ml of aliquot, multiply the total number of viable cells by 2 (the dilution factor for trypan blue) and the correction factor of 104 (volume of each square).",
    "NBD-lipid uptake assayNote: In order to prevent nonspecific binding of the NBD-lipids, all steps must be performed in glass tubes. Prior to the start of the assay, prepare round bottom glass tubes with NBD-lipid stocks in DMSO (see Recipes) and 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice: one empty and one with 30 µL of 20% BSA (see Recipes) for each time point.Note: We routinely use a final BSA concentration of 4.6% (w/v) for NBD-lipid extraction. However, the amount of BSA required for extraction, as well as the incubation time, may vary depending on cell type and lipid analog used in the assay (Fellmann et al., 2000). To determine the optimal conditions, label the cells at 4°C and measure the cell-associated fluorescence after different time of contact of the cell suspension with BSA. To start cell labeling, add 3 mL of the cell suspension (from Step A12) into the glass tubes containing the NBD-lipid stocks, and gently vortex for 2 s (Figure 2).Incubate cells with NBD-lipids for the desired time periods, e.g., 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min. Note that for t=0 min, samples need to be collected immediately after addition of cells to the lipid suspensions. When analysing uptake of several NBD-lipids in parallel, start cell additions spaced by 1 min intervals.At each time point, gently vortex the cell suspensions for 2 s using low vortex power settings to avoid pelleting of the cells, and take two aliquots of 100 µL. Transfer one aliquot to a pre-cooled empty 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, and the other aliquot to a precooled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube containing 30 µL of 20% BSA (see Figure 2).",
    "Note: At this point, additional samples can be taken for analyzing metabolic conversion of the fluorescent lipid analogs using lipid extraction and thin layer chromatography analysis (see section D). Keep the samples on ice for a maximum of one hour after collecting the last sample, and analyse them via flow cytometry.Turn on the CyFlow® SL flow cytometer, start the computer, and open the FlowMax software.Click on the panel “Instrument Settings” and manually enter the parameters (Table 1).Note: Save the employed parameters on the instrument to reload in future runs. Open the gating menu, select “Polygon” and click on “New”. Generate a gate in the plot, by default termed R1, with the parameters forward scatter (FSC) in the x-axis and side scatter in the y-axis (Dawaliby et al., 2016), covering most of the surface in the center of the plot.Note: Gates can be saved and loaded in future runs. Click on the option “Setup” to open the Setup window. Select as the maximal count number for R1 10,000 cells. Click “OK”.Note: We typically count cells until reaching 10,000 in gate R1 (corresponding to population P1). To rinse the machine before use, add 1 mL of TBSS into a flow cytometer tube and run for about 1 min at a speed between 4–8 µL s1.Note: Make sure there are very little to no counts and thus, no contamination or residual cells in the flow cytometer. In case of contaminants, rinse for longer times with TBSS and, if still persistent, wash with the cleaning solution, and then again with TBSS. Set the flow speed at 3–4 µL s-1 for counting on average 300 cells s-1. Speed can be adjusted if necessary.",
    "Transfer the cell sample into a flow cytometer tube, followed by addition of 1 µL of 1 mg mL-1 PI and 1 mL of TBSS. Shortly vortex and place the sample tube in the sample holder. PI labelling allows excluding dead cells from the analysis, which readily absorb NBD-lipids because of the disruption of their plasma membranes. Upon addition of a new cell sample, a message appears to save the data just collected. In the equipment used, samples are automatically saved in the .fcs format (check “Data analysis” on how to proceed for samples analysis).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4330/bioprotoc-12-04-4330-g002.jpgFigure 2. Schematic illustration of the NBD-lipid uptake assay. For labeling, cells (106 cells mL-1) pre-incubated with phospholipase inhibitors at 20°C are transferred to glass tubes containing the DMSO-dissolved NBD-lipid, and then incubated for different time periods. At each time point, two aliquots of 100 µL are taken. One aliquot is transferred to a pre-cooled empty 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube, and the other aliquot to a precooled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube containing 30 µL of 20% BSA. Samples are subsequently analysed by flow cytometry. Details on the individual steps are described in the text.Table 1. Parameters employed for flow cytometry analysis of the mammalian cell line CHO-K1 labelled with NBD-lipids. Settings employed for each parameter, including gain, scale (Log), lower limit (L-L) and upper limit (U-L). FSC, forward scatter; SSC, side scatter; FL1, channel for NBD fluorescence; FL3, channel for PI fluorescence. The flow cytometer used is equipped with a blue solid state laser (488 nm, 20 mW). FL1 and FL3 fluorescence are recorded with a band pass filter IBP 527/30 and a long pass filter RG 630 nm, respectively. Note that these values might require adjustment depending on the cell line and/or flow cytometer employed.table:",

    "Analysis of fluorescent lipid metabolismLipid extraction can be performed based on the modified (Bligh and Dyer, 1959) protocol. The method is based on the partitioning of lipids in a biphasic mixture of chloroform and methanol. Methanol disrupts hydrogen bonds between lipids and proteins following addition of an organic solvent such as chloroform. Except centrifugation, all steps described are performed in a flow cabinet to avoid direct exposure to organic solvents.Transfer aliquots of the cell suspension at the given time points to 12 mL glass tubes. We typically analyse the metabolism after 60 min, by taking volumes corresponding to ~4 nmol NBD-lipid (150 µL of cells labelled with NBD-PE; 300 µL of cells labelled with NBD-PC; 600 µL of cells labelled with NBD-PS or NBD-SM).Add up to 2 mL of ddH2O considering the volume already present in each glass tube.Add 2.2 mL of methanol followed by 2 mL of chloroform using glass graduated pipettes and vortex carefully for 3–5 s to achieve a single phase.Centrifuge the tubes at 500 × g for 5 min to obtain two separated phases.Transfer the lower phase (chloroform phase containing lipids) into a conical bottom glass tube using a glass Pasteur pipette.For a second round of extraction, add 1 mL of chloroform to the original tubes, vortex shortly and centrifuge again at 500 × g for 5 min.Transfer the lower phase into the glass tubes from Step D5.Prepare four conical bottom glasses and add 4 nmol of NBD-PC, NBD-PE, NBD-PS and NBD-SM resuspended in chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) from the same lipid stocks used to label the cells. These samples will serve as standards to compare to the extracted lipid samples.",
    "Dry both the lipid extracts and the standard samples under vacuum at 250 mbar overnight or under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas for 30 min to 1 h.On a TLC silica plate, mark 1 cm lines as loading spots with a pencil. These should be 1.5 cm apart from the bottom edge and 1 cm apart from the side edges and from each other. Draw a total of eight lines, four for the NBD-lipid standards and four for the extracted NBD-lipid samples (Figure 3A). Samples information can be written by pencil under the loading spots. Do not use excessive force when writing on a TLC plate as this will remove the silica coating.Carefully pour the running buffer (see Recipes) into the developing chamber until filled to ~0.5 cm of heigh. Close with the lid to allow air saturation for ~20 min.Dissolve the extracted dried lipids (~4 nmol) and the 4 nmol NBD-lipid standards in a volume of ~5 µL of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v).Apply the dissolved NBD-lipids onto the TLC silica plate using a glass Pasteur pipette, by placing it carefully on top of the 1 cm loading spot to avoid peeling off the silica and ensuring even distribution. Let the organic solvent evaporate before adding more sample on top on the loading spot.Place the TLC plate as evenly as possible in the chamber with a slight tilt. Close the lid and run for 20–25 min, or until the running front has reached a distance of 1 cm from the top edge.Remove the TLC plate from the chamber, mark the running front with a pencil, and let it dry for 15–30 min.Image NBD-lipid fluorescence in the Chemidoc Imaging System, using the Image LabTM software and emission filter 530/28 nm under Blue light Epi illumination (Figure 5C).",
    "Note: Place the TLC plate on top of a transparent plastic bag to avoid scratching the Chemidoc tray surface. Optional: Band intensities can be quantified using the Image LabTM software, e.g., to assess the percentage of metabolic conversion of lipids. Low hydrolysis (<10%) does not affect the NBD-lipid internalization kinetics. However, for higher hydrolysis (>10%) it is crucial to determine whether the converison occurs intracellularly or on the cell surface, to interpret the results.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4330/bioprotoc-12-04-4330-g003.jpgFigure 3. Preparation of the TLC. A) Marking of the loading spots on the silica plate with a pencil and loading of the NBD-lipids with a glass Pasteur pipette (for details see text). The lanes should not be placed too close to the edge: keep a distance of 1.5 cm as indicated by red arrows. B) Silica plate placed into the TLC chamber containing the alkaline running buffer and covered with the glass lid. The plate is developed until the solvent is about half a centimeter below the top of the plate."
