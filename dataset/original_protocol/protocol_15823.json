    "This protocol follows the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. Rodent experiments were approved and monitored by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Columbia University.\nNOTE: All experiments used two-month-old male mice that weighed approximately 20 g.\n1. Preparation and administration of tamoxifen for inducible genetic ablation of floxed genes\nNOTE: Retinal vessel diameter can be affected by the weight of the animal. Make sure that all animals used for an experiment are of similar weights.\nDilute tamoxifen in corn oil to a concentration of 20 mg/mL.\n\tNOTE: Tamoxifen is a toxicant and is light-sensitive. Protect from light, e.g., with aluminum foil.\nVortex the solution for a couple of seconds.\nLeave in the oven at 55 °C for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the tamoxifen has dissolved completely. Additional vortexing may be necessary.\nStore the solution at 4 °C for up to 1 week.  \nUse a 1 mL syringe fitted with a 26 G needle for tamoxifen injection. Clean the injection area with 70% ethanol.  Administer 2 mg of tamoxifen (100 µL of 20 mg/mL) intraperitoneally (IP) once daily for the established time according to the specific inducible Cre line. \nAllow two days of rest for the animals before starting the experiments.\n2. Preparation of reagents for laser photocoagulation\nRose bengal\n\tNOTE: Rose bengal is light-sensitive. Store in the dark until usage and prepare fresh for best results.\n\t\nPrepare rose bengal by diluting it to 5 mg/mL in sterile saline and filter it through a 0.2 µm syringe filter.\nPrepare a 1 mL syringe fitted with a 26 G needle with rose bengal.\nKetamine/xylazine\n\t\nDilute ketamine and xylazine in sterile saline accordingly for the following concentrations: ketamine (80-100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5-10 mg/kg).",
    "Carprofen\n\t\nDilute carprofen to 1 mg/mL in sterile saline.\nPrepare a 1 mL syringe fitted with a 26 G needle with carprofen.\nSterile saline\n\t\nPrepare a 5 mL syringe fitted with a 26 G needle with sterile saline.\n3. Laser setup\nGently handle the fiber optic cable and connect it to the laser control box and the laser adapter of the retinal imaging microscope.\nTurn the retinal imaging microscope lamp box on.\nTurn the computer on and open the imaging program.\nAdjust the white balance by using a piece of white paper and putting it in front of the mouse eye piece and clicking on Adjust in the imaging program.\nTurn the laser control box on by turning the key and following the instructions on the screen of the laser control box.\n\tNOTE: The laser used in this experiment is Class 3B and can cause eye damage. Wear protective goggles when operating the laser.\nVerify the baseline laser power.\n\t\nUse a laser power meter.\nAdjust the screen of the laser control box to the following parameters: 50 mW and 2,000 ms.\nTurn the laser on and place the power meter in front of the eyepiece.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure microscope light is off while testing baseline laser power.\nPress the footswitch pedal to activate the laser.\nAim for the laser power readout to be 13-15 mW.\n\t\tNOTE: The laser power readout will determine the success rate for retinal vein occlusions. If the laser power readout is too low, adjustments can be made to the power and time of laser exposure. See Table 1 for recommendations.\nAdjust the experimental laser power by setting up the screen of the laser control box for the following parameters: 100 mW, 1,000 ms.\nTurn off the laser.",
    "​NOTE: For safety and to prevent overheating, it is best to keep the laser off between mice.\n4. Mouse tail vein injection of rose bengal\nPour 300 mL of water into a 500 mL beaker.\nWarm the beaker in a microwave oven for 1 min.\nPut gauze in the warm water in the beaker.\nPut the mouse in a restrainer.\nPress the gauze into the mouse tail gently and look for the dilated veins. Disinfect the injection site using an alcohol wipe after the warm water dilation. \nInsert the needle into the injection site and pull on the syringe to ensure you are in the vein. Then, inject the mouse tail vein, administering the correct amount according to the weight of the animal (37.5 mg/kg). Apply pressure on the injection site to avoid hematoma or bleeding. Wipe the site.\nRelease the mouse from the restrainer and return it to the cage.\nAllow 8 min for the rose bengal to circulate before the injection of anesthetics.\n\t​NOTE: This will provide a total of 10 min between the rose bengal injection and laser irradiation.\n5. Occlusion of major veins\nTurn on the heated mouse platform.\nAdd one drop of phenylephrine and tropicamide in each eye.\nInject 150 µL of the anesthetics, ketamine (80-100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5-10 mg/kg) IP.\n\tNOTE: During this procedure, the mouse was given two IP injections. Hence, the sides were alternated. The IP injection for the anesthesia was given into the lower right abdominal quadrant, and the saline was injected intp the lower left abdominal quadrant. Pulling on the syringe before injecting is recommended to ensure that the needle is in the abdomen and not any organs.\nToe-pinch the animal to determine the depth of anesthesia and wait until it is unresponsive.",
    "Add one drop of proparacaine hydrochloride per eye (analgesic).\nAdd gel ointment to both eyes.\nInject 150 µL of carprofen subcutaneously between the ears.\nAccommodate the mouse on the platform.\nAdjust the platform until the view of the retinal fundus is clear and focused.\nCount the retinal veins and take an image of the fundus.\n\tNOTE: Retinal veins are darker and broader than arteries. Veins and arteries alternate; however, sometimes there can be a branched artery close to the optic nerve, and therefore, two adjacent arteries.\nTurn the laser on and aim towards a retinal vein at approximately 375 µm from the optic disc.\nIrradiate the vessel by pressing the footswitch and slightly moving the laser beam up to 100 µm. Repeat this step three times and move the laser beam after each pulse so that the irradiation is not focused in one spot.\nRepeat irradiation on other major vessels to achieve 2-3 occlusions.\n6. Establishing the number of veins occluded at day 0\nTurn off the lamp after irradiating the vessels and wait for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Light exposure can cause retinal damage and inflammation; turn off the lamp during the waiting time to minimize exposure7.\nTurn the lamp back on and count the number of veins occluded.\nTake an image of the fundus.\n7. Aftercare\nInject 1 mL of sterile saline IP.\n\tNOTE: See IP injection details in section 5, step 3.\nAdd lubricant eye drops to both eyes.\nAdd gel ointment to both eyes.\nWatch the mouse as it recovers from anesthesia, and do not return it to the cage with the other animals until fully recovered. Carprofen (5 mg/kg) can be given daily up to 2 days post-procedure. If applied to humans, pain is not a symptom of RVO.",
    "NOTE:  Do not leave the animals unattended until they fully recover from anesthesia.  \n8. Assessment of retinal edema by optical coherence tomography (OCT)\nNOTE: This step can be done at the investigator's time point of interest. The peak of retinal edema for a C57BL/6J mouse is 1 day after the RVO procedure. This time point might vary depending on the background of the mouse.\nTurn on the retinal imaging microscope light box, the OCT machine, and the heated mouse platform.\nThe day after the occlusion, follow steps 5.2 to 5.7 to prepare the animal.\nOpen the imaging and OCT software programs.\nIn the OCT program, adjust the nudge to 5.\nTake OCT at 75 µm distal from the burn or 4 clicks.\nTake OCT images at four quadrants of the retina.\nAnalyze the OCT images using tracing software.\nCompare the retinal thickness of pre-irradiated measures to 1 day post RVO or at the time point of interest.\n\tNOTE: When analyzing the data, take into consideration the number of veins irradiated as this can influence the development of retinal edema. Animals are then euthanized by administering anesthetic followed by perfusion non-survival surgery.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
