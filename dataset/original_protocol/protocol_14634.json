    "Ethics statement: All animal procedures mentioned in this video-article were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center.\nNote: Use sterile microsurgery instruments throughout the surgical procedure. Surgical instruments may be sterilized utilizing an infrared sterilizer at an optimum sterilizing temperature of 1,500 °F (815.6 °C). Telemeters can be reused, however, before inserting it in the animal make sure to sterilize the entire transmitter according to the manufacturer instructions and that the tip of the catheter has been refilled with a special gel provided by the manufacturer.\n1. Experimental Animals\nObtain an IACUC approval for all experiments that will be performed. Consultation with institutional IACUC is highly recommended regarding requirements for post-operative analgesic use after this procedure.\nKeep the animals in climate-controlled rooms having an ambient temperature of 21 °C, 60% relative humidity, and a 12-hr light-dark cycle with free access to food and water.\n\tNote: Because the mouse body has to accommodate the telemetry probe (approximatively 1 cm diameter x 2 cm long), it is preferable to use mice that weigh 20 g or more.\n2. Anesthesia and Operative Preparation\nWeigh the mouse using a precision scale and record its weight. Make sure to handle the animal gently and quietly.\nPlace the animal into the induction chamber and close it. Set oxygen flow rate at 0.5 L/min and set isoflurane concentration at 4 - 5% .\nWhen the mouse loses consciousness, place it on a body warming plate maintained at 36 - 37 °C. Maintain the anesthesia via nosecone with isoflurane set at 2% (keep flow rate at 0.5 L/min).\nPrepare the operation regions by removing the hair from the back of the neck and the ventral aspect of the neck by applying hair removal cream.",
    "Treat the incision site with 3 applications of surgical scrub (betadine solution) alternating with 70% isopropyl alcohol.\n3. Surgery \nPlace the mouse in a supine position. Check for reflexes by pinching the foot, and adjust anesthesia until there is no response. Make an approximately 1-cm midline incision below the neck of the mouse with a scalpel. In the left side of the cut create a subcutaneous space by carefully separating the skin from the underlying connective tissue.\nFlip the mouse, and use a scalpel to make a skin incision of approximately 1.5 cm in the dorsal left side behind the scapula. Create a subcutaneous pocket along the animal's flank large enough to accommodate the device. Insert the transmitter into the pocket.\nInsert a small hemostat clamp in the back incision and maneuver it subcutaneously towards the anterior neck opening. Using the inserted-hemostat clamp, gently grasp a non-toxic polyethylene tube (4 cm length x 1 mm I.D.).\n\t\nPull the hemostat back through the tunnel out the lateral incision in the back until the tubing protrudes from both abdominal and dorsal incision, release the tube from the hemostat. From the back, insert the catheter sensor into the tube to tunnel the tip of the pressure sensing catheter through the neck. From the neck anterior, pull and remove the polyethylene tube and close the dorsal incision using metal clips.\nCarefully separate the mandibular glands using sterile cotton tip applicators and retract the left mandibular gland using an elastic stay hook. Using fine-tipped curved forceps, locate the carotid artery along the left side of the trachea. Keep the surgical site sterile  by placing and securing a sterile drape.",
    "Carefully isolate the vessel from the surrounding tissue and gently separate the vagus nerve (whitish in color) that is along the carotid artery away from the artery. Be careful not to cut or damage the nerve or the artery.\nPass three pieces of non-absorbable 7-0 suture underneath the isolated carotid artery section. Tie the cranial suture to close off blood flow. Pull the suture that is closest to the sternum to temporarily occlude blood flow from the aorta.\nMake a loose knot using the middle suture. This will be used to secure the catheter in the vessel. Cut a small incision into the artery between the cranial and the sternal sutures using micro-scissors.\nGrab the catheter with special vessel cannulation forceps, being careful not to squeeze the catheter to prevent gel loss from the probe. Gently, grab the artery with a fine tip curved tweezers forceps, retrieve the catheter, and insert it in the vessel through the small incision.\nTighten the middle suture node around the artery and gently advance the catheter. Gently release the suture that is proximal to the sternum and continue to advance the catheter towards the transverse aorta.\n\t\nObserve the mark on the catheter that gives an approximate index of how far the catheter needs to be inserted. Once the point is reached, gently tighten both the lower and the upper suture around the catheter. The catheter is secured to the carotid artery by suture knots.\nClose the skin incision with non-absorbable 5-0 suture. Once closed, seal the incision with tissue adhesive.\n4. Surgical Recovery and BP Measurements\nMonitor animal closely for the return of normal postures and behaviors. During the 24 hr post-surgery period administer analgesia as directed by a staff veterinarian.",
    "Once the animals have recovered (5 - 7 days post-surgery), house them individually in a regular mouse cage placed on top of the telemetry receiver plate.\nTurn the implanted transmitters \"on\" and \"off\" by using a magnetic device briefly positioned close to the animal from the outside of the cage.\nSubscription Required.
