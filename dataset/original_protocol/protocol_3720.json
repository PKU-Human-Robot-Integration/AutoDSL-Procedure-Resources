    "For generating mice with multiple mutations, the same procedure was performed except for the preparation of electroporation solution for delivering sgRNA or sgRNA+ssODN into the zygote (steps 4a–d of step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details]). We performed 10 simultaneous genetic modifications in Sakurai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]. However, if necessary, a number of sgRNAs in the range of 2–9 can be selected (See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nHerein, we only describe the preparation of an electroporation solution for the delivery of 10 sgRNAs with various target sites (Sakurai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nDay 0, preparation of the electroporation solution for delivering 10 sgRNAs into the zygote\nPrepare 30 μL of mixed sgRNAs (50 ng/μL per sgRNA, total 500 ng/μL in 75% DPBS) in a 0.2-mL PCR tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_646_28.csv\nHeat the tube at 75°C for 5 min and then keep it at 21°C–25°C for 5–10 min.\nThereafter, add 30 μL of Opti-MEM (final sgRNA concentration, 25 ng/μL per sgRNA, total 250 ng/μL in a 1:1 mixture of 75% DPBS and Opti-MEM).\nKeep on ice until use (60 μL in the 1:1 medium).\nNote: In our analysis (Sakurai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), the upper limit of sgRNA concentration of the mixture solution was set to 250 ng/μL. However, up to approximately 400 ng/μL would be considered possible (unpublished data). If necessary, each sgRNA concentration can be increased to >25 ng/μL to increase the biallelic mutation rate. However, when targeting a gene whose functional deficiency causes lethality, the sgRNA concentration is to be preferably maintained at approximately 25 ng/μL (Sakurai et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])."
