    "Individually-housed male adult (8-12 weeks) C57BL/6 mice were used in this experiment. Animals received proper care before, during and after experimental procedures with food and water ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the animal ethics committee from Federal University of Minas Gerais (protocol number 59/2014).\n1. Electrode Placement\nSedating and fixating the animal onto the stereotaxic apparatus\nSterilize all the necessary surgical instruments.\n\t\tNote. Surgical instruments were sterilized for 3 minutes at 440 °C. Cotton swabs were autoclaved at 20 psi (pounds per square inch) at 121 °C for 20 min.\nAdjust the thermal platform controller to 37 °C.\nWeigh the animal and calculate the appropriate dose for anesthesia induction. Use a mixture of ketamine and xylazine at a dose of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 8 mg/kg xylazine, given intraperitoneally (needle size, 31 G). The animal should fall asleep within 2 to 3 min.\nUse an electric shaver or razor to shave down the surgical site.\nPlace the animal onto the stereotaxic apparatus over the pre-warmed heating plate.\nHold the animal's head and insert the tip ear bars into each of the animal's ears to fix it to the stereotaxic platform.\nVerify there is no lateral head shifting and little vertical movement after by slowly shifting the animal's head positioning.\nGently slide the anesthesia mask over the mouse's nose and fix it in place by tightening the screw.\nSet the isoflurane to 1% with 1.0 L/min of O2.\nApply eye ointment to the animal's eyes to prevent corneal drying during the surgery.\nAttaching the implant to the animal's head\nUse the cotton swabs to prepare the surgical site with three alternating scrubs of povidone-iodine (or 2% chlorhexidine) and 70% ethanol.",
    "Use a pair of tweezers to verify anesthesia depth by lightly squeezing the animal's toes and verifying the loss of animal's pedal withdrawal (toe pinch) reflex.\nMake an incision about 3 mm posterior to the animal's ear line and stop at the eye line. The incision site must have approximately 1 cm in length to be large enough to receive the implant.\nGently scrape the cranium with a bone scraper to improve glue and cement adherence. Do this light handedly with the intention of creating micro scratches.\nCarefully position surgical hooks to the loose skin to maintain an open surgical field and free of obstructions such as skin and fur.\nUse a sterile cotton swab to dry the animal's scalp.\nUse a dissecting microscope to visualize the top of the animal's cranium.\nAttach a needle to the stereotaxic holder and locate the bregma. Position the needle directly above the animal's head slightly touching the bregma.\nZero out all coordinates on the digital tracer and then raise the needle.\nFix the tDCS implant on the stereotaxic holder. Position the implant over the animal's head and lower it slowly onto the region of interest using the proper stereotaxic coordinates.\nUse a needle to spread 1 drop (approximately 35 μL) of super glue onto the implant's base.\nSlowly move the holder downwards until it touches the skull. Be sure that the implant base is entirely in contact with the surface.\nPrepare the surgical cement according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nAfter precise positioning, apply 3 thin, even layer of cement across the cranium and onto the lower portion of the implant. Apply drop per drop using an application brush. Layers must form a hill-shaped structure for further structural support of the implant.",
    "Leave the implant's screw thread clean of cement to allow a smooth, unobstructed connection.\nAllow each layer to dry for approximately 4 minutes.\nWhen dry, carefully remove the holder until it is completely detached from the implant. Always use extreme caution when handling the implant, since it may be accidentally extracted from the animal's skull.\nFinishing surgery and post-surgical care\nHydrate the animal's skin in the incision site with a saline-soaked cotton swab.\nCoat the skin over the base of the tDCS implant.\nUse a pair of tweezers to bring the tissue together and close the incision with a drop of surgical tissue glue per 0.2 cm of tissue.\nInfiltrate 1-2% lidocaine in the incision site and underlying tissues.\nHydrate the mouse with 500 µL of lactate Ringer's solution subcutaneously.\nPlace the mouse into a pre-warmed (37 °C) clean, single-housed cage.\nPut a small dish with wet food pellets in the cage for easy access to food in the following hours.\nRegister the animal's post-surgical weight.\nGive the animal ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously after the surgery and on the next 2 days.\nMonitor the recovery of the animal closely for at least 1 week. Assess any sign of distress, such as piloerection, lack of grooming, reduced locomotion, wound scratching and inflammation of the surgical site.\n2. tDCS Setup and Stimulation\ntDCS Setup (see Figure 2)\n\t​Note. Make sure that the tDCS stimulator is fully charged.\n\t\nAttach the anode and cathode cables to the tDCS stimulator and make them available near the stimulation site. Attach the pin-type electrode to the stereotaxic holder.\nSet the thermal platform to 37 °C.\nTurn on the oxygen flowmeter on the inhalation anesthesia system to 1 L/min.\nPlace the mouse into the anesthesia induction chamber.",
    "Turn on the isoflurane vaporizer to 3%. Allow the animal to undergo isoflurane effects for 4 min.\nWhile the animal is in the induction chamber, use a sterile syringe to fill the body electrode with 0.9% saline solution.\nRemove the animal from the induction chamber and position its chest over the body electrode.\nGently slide the anesthesia mask over the mouse's nose and fix it in place. Lower the isoflurane output to 1.5%.\nFill the implant and the pin-type electrode with saline and carefully attach them.\nAdjust stimulation time and current intensity.\nVerify the contact quality on the tDCS stimulator.Optimal contact goes from 7 to 10 on a 1 to 10 scale.\nStimulation\nStart the stimulation.\nObserve the current ramping up for 30 s to the selected value and maintaining itself steady for the established time, then, at the end of the session ramping down again.\nActivate the sham button for control mice.\nObserve the current ramping up for 30 s to the selected value and then down to 1 for the rest of the stimulation period with a final ramp to the selected value at the end with a consecutive ramp down.\nOnce the stimulation session is complete, carefully transfer the animal to a pre-warmed (37 °C) cage for 10 min.\n\t\tNote. Animals start to awaken after 3 min.\nTurn the inhalation anesthesia system off.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
