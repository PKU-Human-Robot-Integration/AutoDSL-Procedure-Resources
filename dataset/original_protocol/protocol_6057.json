    "Quantification of serotonin levels in plants Levels of serotonin in plants were quantified by HPLC according to Kang et al. (2007) with some modifications. Grind fresh tissue (of leaf/stem/root) in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and immediately store in a -80 °C freezer.Weight one to three grams powder and dissolve in 8 ml methanol by shaking for 10 min on an orbital shaker (4 °C, 200 rpm). Centrifuge the mixed solution at 13,500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Transfer and filter the supernatant to a new tube using a syringe with a Millex-LG filter (0.2 μm), Add 2 ml distilled water (1/4 volume of the total) at room temperature.Slowly inject the above solution into a pre-activated Sep-pak C18 cartridge (first wash with methanol in three times volume of the cartridge column, followed by distilled water of the same amount) and collect effluent into a 50 ml tube.Wash the cartridge using 10 ml 80% methanol and collect the effluent into the 50 ml tube. Transfer the effluent into a round-bottomed flask for drying in a rotary evaporator (40 °C under vacuum). Add 500 μl 50% methanol into the flask and dissolve the residue by slightly shaking. Analyze the serotonin level on reverse-phase HPLC. Inject 10 μl sample solution into a C18 column, mixed with an isocratic solution of 10% methanol in water containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, and detect the signal at 280 nm. Prepare standard serotonin at concentrations of 2, 1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1 μg/ml. Analyze 10 μl of serotonin standard solution as above to determine the retention time and quantitative relationship between concentration and peak area.Calculate the serotonin concentration according to serotonin retention time point.",
    "Quantification of serotonin levels in brown planthopper (BPH) (Figure 1)The content of serotonin in BPH body is lower compared with that in plants, hence the measurement of serotonin needs to be performed on HPLC-MS, here is the protocol modified from Ma et al. (2011).Collect about 15 adult insects from rice plants into 2 ml centrifuge tubes. After starving for 12 h, freeze in liquid nitrogen, homogenize into powder and store in a -80 ° C freezer.Transfer 10-20 mg insect homogenate to 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, add 300 μl ice-cold 0.1 M perchloric acid, after brief vortexing, and keep on ice for 10 min.Centrifuge the mixture at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Transfer and filter the supernatant to a new tube using a syringe with a Millex-LG filter (0.2 μm), and store at -20 °C until HPLC-MS analysis.Analyze the serotonin level on HPLC-MS system, Agilent Technologies 1290 with Agilent 6460 triple mass selective detector under multi reaction monitoring (MRM) working mode. Inject 10 μl sample solution into a C18 column (Zorbax XDB, 2.1 x 150 mm, 3.5 μm). Mix with a gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The elution is composed of 2 mmol/L ammonium acetate containing 0.1% formic acid and methanol with increasing methanol proportion from 19% to 90% (v/v) during the first 2.5 min, and remain the methanol proportion at 90% from 2.5 to 4.5 min.Settings for the MS system are: gas temperature: 325 °C, gas flow: 5 L/min, sheath gas temperature: 350 °C, sheath gas flow: 11 L/min, nebulizer pressure: 344.8 kPa, capillary voltage: 3,000 V, nozzle voltage: 500 V in positive mode. Parent ion (m/z) 177, daughter ion (m/z) 160. Use nitrogen as the drying and sheath gas, and argon as collision gas.",

Serotonin content in leaf and stem of WT Jiazhe B. E. Serotonin content in BPH females after feeding on WT (Jiazhe B) or mutant (Jiazhe LM) rice plants. Prior to the assay, female adults were starved for 12 h.BPH artificial diet experimentThe artificial diet experiment was performed as previously described (Fu et al., 2001; Ji et al., 2017). Prepare artificial diet (D-97) for BPH according to Koyama et al. (1988), modified by Fu et al. (2001), supplemented with serotonin at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 μg/ml.Cover one end of the glass cylinder (Figures 2A-2B) with parafilm, drop 40 µl artificial diet (Figure 2C) on to the parafilm at the center, cover with another layer of parafilm (Figures 2D-2F).Insert a piece of wet filter paper (2 x 6 cm) and release 20 second-instar BPH nymphs into the cylinder (Figure 2G).Cover the other end as Step C2. Wrap the cylinder with a black cotton cloth (Figure 2H).Place the cylinders in a growth chamber at 28 ° C under 16 h/8 h day/night cycles with a photon flux density of 250 μmol of photons m-2 s-1.",
    "Every day, transfer survived nymphs to a new cylinder (prepared the same as above) with fresh diets, and record the mortality at the same time for five days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190217/20190217201824_1478.jpgFigure 2. Step-by-step procedure for preparation of cylinders for BPH artificial diet experiment SSB artificial diet experimentPrepare an artificial diet according to Han et al. (2012), with supplementation of 1 μg/g serotonin as appropriate.Cut artificial diet into small patches (Figure 3A) and insert one into each plastic tube (24 x 95 mm).For production of neonates, thread 2-3 leaf segments with SSB eggs in one insect pin and place in the tube with artificial diets without serotonin supplementation (Figure 3B). Transfer one neonate into one tube with one pellet of the artificial diet supplemented with 1 µg/g serotonin (Figure 3C).Place the tubes in a growth chamber with a photon flux density of 250 μM of photos m-2 s-1 in an 8 h light/16 h dark regime at 28 °C. Replace diet every two days (Figure 3D)Examine the larvae development stage every day, and weight larvae after each molting until the 6th instar stage.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190217/20190217201842_7120.jpgFigure 3. Step-by-step procedure for SSB egg hatching and artificial diet experimentIn support of the role of serotonin in BPH and SSB resistance in rice, the beneficial effect of this hormone was demonstrated in artificial diets, with increased performance of both BPH (Figure 4A) and SSB (Figure 4B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190217/20190217201935_8247.jpgFigure 4. Addition of exogenous serotonin attracts BPH and SSB feeding. A. Addition of serotonin to the artificial diet increases BPH survival rates. Relative survival rate (%) = (Nt-Nc)/Nc x 100, Nc and Nt stand for the number of survived nymphs feeding on an artificial diet without and with serotonin, respectively, at a given time point. B. Addition of serotonin in artificial diet enhances SSB performance. Control stands for artificial diet without serotonin.",
