    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: The steps below are only for the protocols we modified from the manufacturer's suggestion. Because we deal with both mouse and human proteins in this protocol, we will distinguish them by referring to the mouse proteins with only the first letter capitalized (e.g., Pum1) and human proteins in all caps (PUM1).\nGross brain morphology with Nissl staining\nAnimal perfusion\nTiming: 10–20 min per animal\nBefore starting\nPum1 mutant mice were previously generated in a B6/129 mixed background by the University of Connecticut Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility (Chen et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: All work with fixative should be carried out under a chemical fume hood because paraformaldehyde (PFA) is highly toxic.\nPrepare the following items:\n    500 mL bottle with 1× PBS solution.\n    250 mL bottle with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\n    500 mL bottle of RNase free distilled water.\n    Fill the required number of 20 mL vials (one vial per brain) with about 10 mL of 4%PFA.\nPrepare the pump:\n    Prepare the tubing system as in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, attaching to one end of the tube a 27G needle.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1504-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Brain perfusion\n(A) Minipump shows all the connected tubes.\n(B) Glass drop jar to hold the mouse after the anesthesia, before the procedure begins.\n(C) The skin is pulled before making a small incision just large enough to insert the scissors and enlarge the gap.\n(D) Cut through the diaphragm along the rib cage until you see the heart.\n(E) Right atrium and the left ventricle. Insert the needle into the left ventricle and make a small incision on the right atrium.\n(F) Cartoon representing how to properly insert the needle in the left ventricle (magnification on the bottom).\n(G) Representative image of 5-week old Pum1−/− cerebellum with Nissl staining.",
    "Fill the tubing system connected to the peristaltic pump (Gilson Inc. 3P Miniplus III peristaltic pump, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) with 1× PBS until the solution starts coming from the needle drop by drop but not too slowly. The recommended speed is 5 mL/min.\nNote: If there is no pump available, it is possible to perfuse the brain using a handheld syringe, but this takes considerable skill to maintain steady pressure at the desired level. We recommend a pump as to produce better, more consistent results.\nWeigh the mouse in order to calculate the amount of Avertin needed.\nAnesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection (IP) of 250 mg/kg of avertin (0.5 mL of avertin solution for a 25 g mouse) and place the mouse in a glass jar (or any place with low external sound) for several minutes in order to give the anesthetic time to take effect (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: the age, weight, and general health of the mouse will all influence the amount of time it takes for the anesthetic to work. The IACUC recommends 125–250 mg/kg IP for dosage and estimates 5 min to induce anesthesia, 15–30 min under anesthesia, and 90 min to complete recovery, but the mice might go under anesthesia in 2–3 min or it might take almost 15 min if the animal is old or obese. Therefore, you must check to see whether the mouse has truly lost consciousness by pinching the paws with a forceps — a fully anesthetized animal will not respond. For more details see (Koizumi et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Lieggi et al., 2005a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], 2005b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Meyer and Fish, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Reid et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Tarin and Sturdee, 1972[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Zeller et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).",
    "Place the animal on its back on a flat, raised surface (you can use a plastic tray or styrofoam surrounded by a container to collect fluids).\nGently tape the animal's paws to a plastic tray (or needle if you use a styrofoam tray) to immobilize them (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D).\nPull the skin on the abdomen up and make an incision. Insert the scissors and enlarge the gap, making sure to avoid damaging the liver (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nGently make an incision into the diaphragm and along the rib cage to reveal the heart (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: For convenience, incise the sternum, avoiding the lungs. This allows you to bend the upper part of the rib cage to expose the heart (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D);\nCarefully insert the pump needle into the left ventricle, making sure not to puncture any other part of the heart.\nCut the right atrium, and at the same time, start pumping the PBS 1× solution in at 5 mL/min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nNote: Thick blood should be visible. Continue to perfuse with 1× PBS until the liver changes color from dark to light brown and the body structures (paws, for instance) turn white.\nPerfuse with 15–20 mL of PBS 1×.\nStop the pump and quickly transfer the tube in the 4% PFA container.\nResume pumping 15–20 mL 4% PFA.\nAs the PFA solution enters the circulatory system, the tail and other body parts will twitch and move.\nWhen the paws and tail become inflexible, stop the pump.\nRemove the needle from heart, flush with water, refill with 1× PBS for the next animal.\nDecapitate the mouse and cut the skin of the head longitudinally from the neck to between the eyes.\nWith scissors cut the skull starting from the occipital region to the nasal bones.",
    "Make a cut between the left and right anterolateral corner of the frontal bone.\nUsing forceps, detach the right and left portion of the skull bone to reveal the brain.\nUsing a spatula scoop the brain away and place it in 10 mL of 4% PFA (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nCritical: Between mice, wash the pump with RNase free distilled water for 3–4 min in order to flush out the residual 4% PFA and then fill the pump with 1× PBS.\nBrain preparation\nTiming: 3–5 days\nIncubate brain overnight in 4% PFA-1× PBS solution at 4°C.\nThe next day change to 5% sucrose in 1× PBS and place the vial back at 4°C for 1 h.\nThe next day, change to 10% sucrose in water and place the vial at 4°C for 1 h, the brain should sink to the bottom of the vial.\nReplace with 20% sucrose in water solution place the vial at 4°C from 2 h to overnight (about 16 h) until the brain will sink at the bottom of the vial.\nNote: If the brain does not sink to the bottom of the vial wait until it does sink in the solution.\nChange to 30% sucrose in water solution and place at 4°C. With 30% sucrose the brain can take longer than one day to sink to the bottom of the vial.\nTissue inclusion and cryostat sectioning\nTiming: 1–2 days\nRemove the brain from 30% sucrose solution, dry the brain as much as you can on a paper towel (we used Kimwipes).\nPlace the brain into a freezing mold, cover with Tissue-Plus™ O.C.T.\nPlace the freezing mold on a flat surface with dry ice.\nTake the frozen O.C.T. embedded brain out from the mold and section it on Leica CM3050S Cryostat at 30 μm thickness.",
    "Mount sections on gelatin-subbed microscope glass slides either directly or collect the slides in a 1× PBS solution in a 12 well plate with no more than 4–5 sections per well.\nNote: brain sections in 1× PBS can be stored at 4°C for a short time. If you wish to store them for more than one week, prepare a 1× PBS solution with 0.02% of sodium azide to prevent bacterial growth. This should allow storage at 4°C for about 30 days.\nNote: for frozen sectioning, it is also possible to snap-freeze the tissue without the perfusion, but then blood will remain in the tissue. For applications like Nissl staining or immunofluorescence it is important to clear blood from the tissue and fix it with PFA before placing in O.C.T.\nDry-mount the slides on the Fisherbrand™ Slide Drying Bench (FisherScientific) at 60°C for several hours or at room temperature overnight.\nNissl staining\nTiming: 30–40 min\nPrepare 300 mL of ethanol 100%, 95% and 70% in distilled water. Place six glass jars under a chemical fume hood and fill each with one of the following six solutions: 1) 100% 200-proof ethanol, 2) 95% 200-proof ethanol, 3) 70% 200-proof ethanol, 4) distilled water, 5) Cresyl violet solution, 6) Xylene.\nTake the mounted brain slides and immerse them in the following order:\n100% Ethanol for 1–2 min;\n95% Ethanol for 1 min;\n70% Ethanol for 1 min;\nwater for 2–3 dips;\nCresyl violet solution for 2–3 min;\nwater for 2–3 dips;\n70% Ethanol for 1 min;\n95% Ethanol for 1 min;\n100% Ethanol for 1 min;\nXylene for 1 min.\nNote: immerse the glass slides very carefully to keep the brain slices from sliding out. Always use RNase-free water to treat the slides and to prepare the ethanol solutions.",
    "Place 3–4 drops of Permount Mounting Medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences) on the slide.\nHold the slide at a slant. Gently, slowly move the coverslip from the bottom edge of the slide to the top in order to allow air to be replaced with Permount. Gently push the cover glass with finger. Wipe the other side of the slide with a Kimwipe and let dry for at least 3 hours to overnight.\nImages are now ready to be acquired in a bright field microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nNote: If you want to store the slides, please allow 1–2 days for them to dry completely at room temperature before storing them in boxes. It is possible to work with the slides before they are completely dry, but in this case be careful that the cover slip does not fall apart.\nPlating and preparing dissociated cultured neurons on coated coverslips for Sholl analysis\nCover slip coating\nTiming: 1 h to overnight\nUnder a laminar flow cabinet place one glass cover slip for each well of a 12-well plate.\nAdd 400 μL of coating medium.\nIncubate at 37°C for 1 h or overnight.\nNote: Perform the following steps the day of hippocampal dissociation (see step 40 of tissue harvesting and dissociation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2.2] section)\nWash three times with 4 mL of sterile water.\nLet dry open under the biosafety cabinet for at least 15 min before seeding.\nTissue harvesting and dissociation\nTiming: 1 h and 20 min\nNote: Primary hippocampal neurons were dissected from neonatal mice.\nCritical: Maintain sterile conditions throughout the entire procedure.\nRemove the mouse's head and place it in a 10 cm petri dish filled with 5 mL of Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) 1×.",
    "Make a careful incision into the skin and the skull, carefully remove the brain, and transfer it to a 10 cm plate with HBSS 1× (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1504-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Add 750 μL of pre-warmed plating medium to the cells.\nDissociate using a p1000 and a p200 pipette, pipetting up and down for 15 times (or until no more cell clumps are visible) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nPut cells through 70 μm cell strainer collecting the cells in a 50 mL conical tube.\nTransfer the cells in a 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCount the cells with a hemocytometer and adjust the volume to 0.5 × 106 cells/mL.\nPlate ∼3.5 × 105 cells per well in a 12-well plate support (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nOn the next day (first day in vitro, i.e., DIV1), remove plating media and replace with 1 mL of growth medium.\nOn DIV4, replace half of the medium with fresh medium containing 10 μM final concentration of 5-Fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine/Uridine FdU/U. Repeat this step every 2 days.\nNote: We add FdU/U to the growth medium to inhibit the growth of glial cells.\nTransfection of cultured neurons with plasmids\nTiming: 60 min\nNote: The 3×HA-PUM1 mutants were generated by mutagenesis from wild-type (WT) constructs as described above. Prepare pEGFP-C1 and 3×HA-PUM1 plasmids by DIV9 using an endotoxin-free Plasmid Midi Kit.\nAt DIV9, check the quality of the plated neurons by observing them under a microscope.\nNote: At DIV9 the neurons have extended their neurites, healthy neurons have multiple neurites and will be attached to the surface of the coverslip. You may see debris surrounding the cells, which is an indicator of cellular distress and death; if there is a lot of debris, you need to adjust your culture or image acquisition procedures. It is also important to keep the number of glial cells to a minimum, because they will quickly outcompete neurons in growth and make further analysis difficult.",
    "For each transfection, prepare Solution A and Solution B (as in the table below) in separate sterile microcentrifuge tubes according to the manufacturer’s instructions (CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1504_8.csv\nNote: Solution B is a solution of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (2× HBS) provided by the CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit.\nVortex Solution A while adding Solution B (2× HBS) dropwise (usually takes 30 s–1 min per reaction).\nIncubate the mixed A+B solution at 24°C–26°C for 30 min.\nGently add the A+B solution dropwise to wells of a 12-well plate containing coverslip-plated neurons.\nGently move the plate back and forth to evenly distribute the transfection solution.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 8 h to overnight.\nReplace the medium containing transfection solution with growth medium.\n24 h later, assess the success of transfection by monitoring pEGFP fluorescence in neurons under a fluorescence microscope.\nNote: GFP+ neurons start to become visible under a fluorescence microscope ∼12 h after transfection. The fluorescence will be visible in both soma and neurites.\nImmunocytochemistry\nTiming: about 20 h\nNote: i) The earlier the imaging can be done following mounting, the better. All our imaging was completed within 2 weeks of the initial immunocytochemistry to ensure the best staining; ii) any standardized protocol for imaging can be used. The immunocytochemistry protocol will need to be optimized for the antibodies that you are using and the cells of interest; iii) we imaged with a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope and used the Zen2.6 software suite for image acquisition and processing.\nAt DIV14, aspirate growth medium and wash coverslip-plated neurons by adding ice-cold PBS.\nPause point: before immunocytochemistry procedures, inspect all transfected neurons under a fluorescence microscope to ensure they are healthy and attached to the plate surface with minimal cellular debris.",
    "Add a solution of 4% PFA in order to fix the cells and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the fixing solution and wash twice neurons by adding ice-cold PBS.\nAdd permeabilization/blocking solution to 12-well plates and incubate at room temperature for 1 h.\nAspirate the permeabilization/blocking solution and wash three times for 5 min each, with ice-cold PBS.\nIncubate with primary antibodies as follows:\nprepare 100 μL of primary antibody solution (anti-GFP [diluted 1:1,000] and anti-HA [diluted in 1:100] in blocking solution) per coverslip.\nplace a 100 μL drop of primary antibody solution on a parafilm-coated plate for each coverslip.\nretrieve the coverslips using forceps, place onto drops of primary antibody solution, and incubate at 4°C for 16 h.\nTransfer the coverslip-plated neurons to wells of a 12-well plate filled with 1× PBS and wash three times for 10 min each time.\nIncubate with secondary antibodies as follows:\nprepare 100 μL of secondary antibody solution (Goat-anti-mouse-Alexa 488 [diluted 1:500] and Donkey-anti-goat-Alexa 594 [diluted in 1:150] in Blocking solution) for each coverslip. Please note that Alexa 594 is used only if you want to double-stain for HA and PUM1; otherwise, you can just use Alexa 488.\nplace 100 μL drop of secondary antibody solution on a parafilm-coated plate for each coverslip.\nretrieve coverslips using forceps, place onto drops of secondary antibody solution, and incubate at 24°C–26°C for 1 h.\nNote: Cover the plate in aluminum foil after adding the secondary antibodies to avoid exposure to light. Perform all further steps in as little light as possible.\nTransfer the coverslip-plated neurons to wells of a 12-well plate filled with 1× PBS and wash three times for 10 min each time",
    "prepare microscope slides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific) and place a drop of VECTASHIELD antifade DAPI mounting medium on the surface of the slide.\nretrieve coverslips from the 12-well plate using forceps and place on slide glasses with neurons facing down.\nseal each coverslip with transparent nail polish.\nConfocal imaging and analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nWe strongly recommend that you image the samples right after staining because the fluorescence decreases over time. In order to have comparable images, we suggest acquiring all the images over the course of a single confocal session. The stained slides can be stored at 4°C.\nAcquire Z-stack images with parameter settings using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM710) equipped with a 63× objective and Zen2.6 Software (Zeiss).\nNote: For these experiments we used the LSM710, but any confocal microscope equipped with a 63× objective can be used.\nGenerate maximum intensity projections for all captured Z-stack files (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nPerform neuron tracing and Sholl analysis using Neurolucida 360 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H) (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nNote: As an internal control, the expression level for each variant was quantified based on the fluorescence signal intensity of the HA tag. Specifically, cells expressing 3×HA-PUM1 were identified and analyzed using the software Imaris (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). The mean intensity of HA at the cell body was used to quantify PUM1 overexpression for each variant and WT.\nNote: To see the final output, you can view all the 212 neurons imaged in (Gennarino et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) at the following resource website: http://neuromorpho.org/NeuroMorpho_Linkout.jsp?PMID=29474920[href=http://neuromorpho.org/NeuroMorpho_Linkout.jsp?PMID=29474920]."
