    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDeparaffinize and rehydrate sections\nTiming: 2 h\nParaffin is removed followed by hydrogen peroxide quenching to avoid detection of endogenous peroxidase activity, and tissue is rehydrated through incubation in graded ethanol solutions.\nNote: Fresh xylenes and graded ethanol solutions should be prepared daily for use in this protocol. For large numbers of stained slides, we recommend replacing these solutions after processing every 50 slides.\nNote: Deparaffinization and rehydration steps should be carried on in a chemical hood to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals.\nRemove paraffin from FFPE sections.\nMelt paraffin to drive off any residual water trapped behind sections.\nPlace slides in a xylene compatible, non-metal slide rack.\nBake the rack of slides in a 55°C dry oven for one hour.\nDissolve surrounding and infiltrating paraffin from the sections. Perform all steps at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nPlace rack of slides in xylene for 5 min.\nTransfer rack of slides to fresh xylene, incubate for 5 min.\nTransfer slides to fresh xylene, incubate for 5 min.\nClear the xylene from slides. Perform all steps at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nPlace rack of slides in 100% ethanol for 5 min.\nTransfer rack of slides to fresh 100% ethanol, and incubate for 5 min.\nNote: It is recommended that two slides be prepared for each case and tissue so that rabbit IgG isotype control can be stained in parallel with the ACE2 stained slide.\nNote: To confirm the antibody specificity, preincubation of the ACE2 antibody with the synthetic peptide to which the antibody was raised could be utilized as an additional staining control.\nBlock endogenous peroxidases.\nPlace rack of slides in freshly prepared 3% hydrogen peroxide diluted in methanol, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).",
    "Optional: Peroxidase blocking can alternatively be performed after the antigen retrieval steps using a commercially available hydrogen peroxide blocking reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nRehydrate sections through graded ethanol solutions. Perform all steps at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nTransfer slide rack to 95% ethanol and incubate 5 min.\nTransfer slide rack to 75% ethanol and incubate 5 min.\nTransfer slide rack to 50% ethanol and incubate 5 min.\nTransfer slide rack through 2 changes of deionized (DI) water for 2 min each.\nPause point: The assay could be paused at step 1 b (i) provided the incubation time does not exceed 72 hours.\nNote: Used xylene and ethanol solutions must be disposed of according to federal, state and organization laws.\nCritical: From this point on, do not allow slides to become dry as background will occur in the staining.\nPerform antigen retrieval\nTiming: 30–40 min\nHeat retrieval is used to reverse fixation crosslinking and enable antibody recognition of the antigen.\nPrepare retrieval chamber.\nPrepare 1× citrate buffer by diluting 1 part of 10× citrate buffer stock solution with 9 parts deionized water.\nTransfer slides from rack to a plastic coplin jar filled with 1×X citrate buffer.\nNote: Slides may be placed back-to-back in the coplin jar to increase capacity.\nAdjust the citrate solution level to cover the top of the slides.\nPlace coplin jar into a 400 mL Pyrex beaker and fill beaker with tap water up to one cm from cap edge.\nNote: Leave lid to coplin jar slightly loose to allow steam to escape.\nRetrieve tissue sections.\nProgram a microwave oven at 600 watts for 7 min.\nPlace coplin/water jacket assembly in center of the microwave and press start.\nWhen microwave cycle ends, remove beaker from microwave and tighten lid.",
    "Allow coplin/water jacket assembly to cool on the bench top for 20 min.\nIncubate slides 1 min in DI water to rinse off buffer.\nUsing PAP pen, make a square or circle hydrophobic barrier around the tissue section to keep staining reagent localized to the tissue and minimize reagent waste.\nPlace slides in prepared humid staining chamber and cover section surface in wash buffer.\nOptional: Use of humid staining chamber is strongly recommended. However, alternatively, use of PAP pen alone should create humid environment and keep tissue sections from drying provided that the incubation time with each staining reagent does not exceed the recommended duration.\nOptional: Borg Decloaker RTU (Biocare Medical, LLC) can be used as an alternative antigen retrieval solution, following manufacturer’s instructions.\nOptional: Heat retrieval methods involving a different heating device, such as a water bath, have been successfully used in this assay. For the water bath epitope retrieval, we recommend the following setting: temperature 97°C; time 30 minutes. The antigen retrieval solution should be pre-warmed to 97°C before adding it to coplin jar with slides. The temperature in water bath should be closely monitored to ensure correct heat.\nOptional: It is possible to adapt this method to use a preferred retrieval reagent provided titer is tested and adjusted.\nBlock tissue sections\nTiming: 70 min–3 h\nEndogenous tissue components are blocked to avoid background stain development.\nBlock biotin present in the tissue using Avidin/Biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories). Perform all steps at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nWipe buffer from the surface of the slide with a folded Kimwipe, avoiding contact with the tissue.\nCover tissue section surface with biotin solution and incubate 15 min.\nWash slides in wash buffer for 5 min.\nWipe buffer from the surface of the slide with a folded Kimwipe, avoiding contact with the tissue.",
    "Cover tissue section surface with avidin solution and incubate for 15 min.\nWash slides in buffer for 5 min.\nWipe buffer from the surface of the slide with a folded Kimwipe, avoiding contact with the tissue.\nOptional: Biotin blocking is not necessary if your tissue type does not contain endogenous biotin.\nPerform normal goat serum blocking.\nCover the tissue section surface with goat serum diluted to 2% in wash buffer and incubate 30 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nNote: Ensure that serum matches the species that the secondary antibody is produced in.\nPause point: The assay can be paused for up to 2 hours provided the goat serum solution level is adequate for the tissue to remain completely wet.\nApply primary antibody\nTiming: 60 min - overnight (8–12 h)\nDiluted primary antibody solution is placed on top of tissue sections to allow recognition of the ACE2 antigen\nPerform primary antibody incubation.\nDilute rabbit monoclonal ACE2 primary antibody at 1:150 in antibody diluent reagent.\nWipe serum from the surface of the slide with a folded Kimwipe, avoiding contact with the tissue.\nCover tissue section-containing area of slide with ACE2 antibody solution.\nIncubate for 1 h.\nOptional: In a separate tube, dilute rabbit IgG isotype control at a final concentration to match that of the ACE2 antibody. Cover tissue section-containing area of an additional slide with isotype control antibody solution.\nNote: Concentration of antibody used is dictated by retrieval method. Alterations to the retrieval conditions will necessitate adjustment of the primary antibody titer.\nPause point: The assay can be paused by placing the humidity chamber at 4°C and incubating overnight (8–12 hours).\nApply secondary and tertiary reagents\nTiming: 80–85 min\nBiotinylated secondary antibody and avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase reagent are sequentially applied to the sections to recognize and amplify the antibody/antigen complex.",
