    "Proteoliposomes are artificial lipid membranes (liposomes with a reconstituted protein). Proteoliposomes have a major advantage as compared with natural membrane systems because they can be obtained with fewer components, thereby allowing a more direct measurement of the activity of the protein of interest with a lower background.

    "The assay development starts with a physiological buffer and uses the \"single solution exchange\" protocol of the SURFE²R apparatus (Nanion Technologies Munich; Figs. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.650#cpz1650-fig-0001] and 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.650#cpz1650-fig-0004]). The physiological buffer is used to attach the membrane or liposomes (non-activating buffer). For the first experiment, membranes are attached at a concentration of 5 µg/well and liposomes with a protein concentration of 100 ng/well, and in the following step a high concentration of substrate (0.5-1.0 mM in assay buffer = activation buffer) is used to test substrate transport. It is always important to additionally spot wild-type cell membrane or empty liposomes on the plate as a control and to test those under the same assay conditions. Some substrates or endogenous proteins generate artefacts on SURFE²R. If a control does not generate currents, you can be sure that the SLC currents are selective and specific due to the transport of the substrate. It is also essential to ensure that the assay buffer and activation buffer have the same composition, aside from the absence or presence of the substrate. Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.650#cpz1650-fig-0005] provides schematic representation of a current trace recorded using a transporter of interest in the presence (red) or absence (black) of the corresponding substrate. The transporter is activated by a concentration jump of substrate that leads to an ion/substrate symport into the vesicles. Ion influx charges the vesicles; at the same time, the sensor also charges, and this charging current is measured and contains information about the kinetics of the transporter.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/69b76ae8-5949-44ed-aae1-e5683d9b9c5b/cpz1650-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",

For the first experimental measurements, perform 3-4 activations without substrate to prove baseline stability. The first activation without substrate is normally done to wash out the remaining storage buffer components. By the second activation without substrate, all residual attachment solutions will have been washed out, so from that point on the baseline will be mostly stable. When starting the assay development, add two more activations without substrate.

    "For some assays, e.g., for the exchange of sodium and potassium, an ion gradient must be established. In these cases, the existing \"double solution exchange\" protocol from Nanion Technologies Munich is applied. The physiological buffer is used to attach the membrane or liposomes and later becomes the non-activating buffer. For the first experiment, membranes are spotted on the plate at a concentration of 5 µg/well and liposomes at a protein concentration of 100 ng/well. Afterwards, a high concentration of substrate (0.5-1.0 mM in assay buffer = activation buffer) is applied to test substrate transport. It is always important to spot wild-type cell membranes or empty liposomes on the plate as a control and to test the those under the same assay conditions. Some substrates generate artefacts on SURFE²R: If a control does not generate currents, you can be sure that the SLC currents are selective and specific due to the transport of the substrate. It is also essential to ensure that the assay buffer and activation buffer always have the same composition, aside from the presence or absence of the substrate.\nNOTE: The exact buffer composition must be adapted to the respective assay.

    "The SURFE²R (Nanion Technologies Munich) has a standard evaluation software called Data Control 96 that can calculate parameters like current maximum or area under the curve (AUC) of each individual recording in an automated way. For raw data analysis, the parameters “max” (maximum height of the signal/peak) and “AUC” (area of the signal/peak) are used.\nAt the beginning of an assay development and by measuring the different dependencies, only AUCs are determined. Later in assay development, i.e., when IC50 values of the standard inhibitors are determined, both parameters can be used for data quantification. AUC data provide usually more consistent and reliable results. Note that the Z' factor is not calculated, because each well has its own controls and the deviation of 100% signals from well to well would have too large an influence.\nThe SURFE²R software, Data Control 96 (Nanion Technologies Munich), is able to calculate the AUC of signal minus the AUC baseline, so that this value can be used for later evaluation (AUC calculated = AUC signal – AUC baseline). For this purpose, the sections in which the signal or the baseline are to be expected must be defined. An advantage of the SURFE²Rs and of this procedure is that each well—i.e., each sensor—has its own low control and its own high control to which the compound measurements are referred.\nEvaluation of which wells should be used for the calculation\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Only if the signal deviation of activations 3-5 is <8% should a given well be used for the later calculation of an inhibition.\n         \n1.Average “AUC calculated” (activations 3-5 plus substrate):\n               \nAverage “AUC calculated” = (AUC calculated 3 + AUC calculated 4 + AUC calculated 5)/3\n2.SD = σ = √(∑x −¯x)2 /n):\n               \n SD “AUC calculated” (activations 3-5 plus substrate)",
