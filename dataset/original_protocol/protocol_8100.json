    "All procedures are to be conducted according the institutional and funding body requirements for animal experimentation. The use of animals for this dissection and the protocol for euthanasia have been approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at the University of Melbourne (Protocol number 1814639).\nNOTE: The dissections illustrated here were performed on adult (~10 weeks) male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (Biomedical Sciences Animal Facility, University of Melbourne), weighing 280 g (female) and 350 g (male). Prior to these dissections, the rats were euthanized in a CO2 chamber for 4âˆ’5 min. Immediately following death, MPG were dissected. If dissecting tissue from an animal that has undergone transcardial perfusion with fixative, take precautions to protect the operator from exposure to fixative, i.e., perform dissection in fume cupboard or downdraft cabinet and wear suitable personal protective equipment. A protocol for transcardial perfusion has been published in detail12.\n1. Major pelvic ganglion and adjacent nerves: access and resection in a male rat\nNOTE: Figure 1 shows anatomical landmarks for MPG visualization in a male rat.\nAccess to the abdominal cavity and pelvis\n\t\nPlace the rat in a supine position and access the abdomen and pelvis through a ventral midline incision, taking care to avoid contamination of the surgical field with fur.\nGently move the abdominal organs to one side using forceps or cotton-tipped applicators. Note the location of the ventral lobes of the prostate gland and the urinary bladder.\nMove the seminal vesicle to the contralateral side.\nCut the vas deferens to provide better access to the area overlying the ganglion.",
    "NOTE: From this point of the dissection, the tissue must not dry out; keep the tissue moist with physiological saline (for fresh tissue dissection) or fixative (for perfusion-fixed animal). Keeping the tissue moist with saline not only benefits tissue structure but also makes the dissection easier as dry nerves are more fragile and tear more easily during handling.\nIdentify the dorsolateral lobe of the prostate gland, on the dorsal surface of which is the location of the ganglion; this will not yet be visible.\nTo visualize the ganglion, carefully clear away tissues near and overlying the ganglion. If necessary, use a retractor to keep the dissection field clear.\nRemove a nearby aggregate of adipose tissue and open the lateral fascia of the pelvis.\nDissection of the MPG and its associated nerves\n\t\nIdentify the following locations that provide landmarks for the next steps of the dissection: the dorsolateral lobe of the prostate gland (the ganglion is located on the surface of this lobe, slightly more caudal than the junction between seminal vesicle and prostate) and the seminal vesicles (where they converge at the midline indicates the ganglion location on the animal's rostrocaudal axis).\nAs required from this point, carefully remove any tissue that impedes complete view of the neural structures, avoiding damage to the thin capsule of the prostate gland or major vessels.\nIdentify the pelvic nerve by visualizing the following landmarks and features.\n\t\t\nFind the internal iliac vein and its fine branch projecting towards the MPG and the bladder. This vascular branch runs parallel to and is sometimes embedded within the pelvic nerve, then traverses the ganglion.\nGently place fine-tipped angled forceps under the pelvic nerve and slide the forceps along to free it from surrounding tissue.",
    "NOTE: It may also be possible to isolate the pelvic nerve from the small vessel running parallel to it, but for most types of experiments this is not essential. Confirm that the structure is the pelvic nerve by viewing under high magnification to determine that the nerve contains several loosely aggregated fascicles, which are easily distinguished under the dissecting microscope and are characteristic of the pelvic nerve, as none of the other major nerves associated with the ganglion show this clear fasciculation.\nIdentify the cavernous nerve by visualizing the following landmarks and features.\n\t\t\nAfter following the pelvic nerve to its junction with the ganglion, follow the cavernous nerve as it travels across the prostate and then caudally towards the cavernous bodies of the penis.\nIf microscope magnification permits, note that there is a small group of delicate nerves emerging from the ganglion between the pelvic and cavernous nerves; these are the rectal nerves that travel to the lower bowel.\nIdentify the hypogastric nerve by visualizing the following landmarks and features.\n\t\t\nIdentify where the hypogastric nerve joins the ganglion at its cranial edge, after travelling alongside the ureter.\nConfirm that the hypogastric nerve is much thinner than either the pelvic or cavernous nerves and is not accompanied by large vessels.\nIdentify the MPG by visualizing the following features.\n\t\t\nVisualize the ventral, dorsal and cranial edges of the ganglion, forming a triangular shape.\nConfirm the location of each major nerve: the pelvic nerves emerging from the ganglion's dorsal edge, the cavernous nerve at the most caudal corner of the ganglion, the hypogastric nerve from its cranial edge, and the accessory nerves emerging from the ganglion's ventral edge.\nIdentify the accessory nerves by visualizing the following landmarks and features.",
    "After clearing tissue to enable visualization of the ventral edge of the ganglion, identify a cluster of nerves that project towards the urinary and reproductive tracts.\nIf microscope magnification permits, identify one caudal group of nerves that enter between the prostate lobes and one rostral group between the seminal vesicle and the bladder.\nRemoval of the MPG with its associated nerves\n\t\nGently slide forceps between the ganglion and the underlying prostate gland, being careful not to puncture the thin capsule of the prostate. Disrupt any connections between the ganglion and the prostate.\nClear any final connections with surrounding tissues for the lengths of nerves required for the experiment, then cut each nerve.\nUsing fine forceps, move the ganglion with its nerves to the appropriate solution for the experiment and confirm that each of the main nerves are intact.\n2. Major pelvic ganglion and adjacent nerves: access and resection in a female rat\nNOTE: Figure 2 shows anatomical landmarks for MPG visualization in a female rat.\nAccess to the abdominal cavity and pelvis\n\t\nPlace the rat in a supine position and access the abdomen and pelvis through a ventral midline incision, taking care to avoid contamination of the surgical field with fur.\n\t\tNOTE: From this point of the dissection, the tissue must not dry out; keep the tissue moist with physiological saline (for fresh tissue dissection) or fixative (for perfusion-fixed animal).\nGently move the abdominal organs to one side using forceps or cotton-tipped applicators. Note the location of the uterine horn, urinary bladder and rectum.\nCut the ovarian and uterine vessels and retract the uterine horn.\nEnter the peritoneal space and gently clear away an aggregate of adipose tissue located near the uterine cervix.\nDissection of the MPG and its associated nerves",
    "Identify the lateral wall of the uterine cervix, just caudal to its junction with the uterine horns; this region is the primary landmark for defining the MPG location on the animal's rostrocaudal axis.\nAs required from this point, carefully remove any tissue that impedes complete view of the neural structures, avoiding damage to major vessels.\nIdentify the pelvic nerve by visualizing the following landmarks and features.\n\t\t\nFind the internal iliac vein and its fine branch projecting towards the MPG and the bladder. This branch runs parallel to and is sometimes embedded within the pelvic nerve, then traverses the ganglion.\nConfirm that the structure is the pelvic nerve by viewing under high magnification to determine that the nerve contains several loosely aggregated fascicles, which are easily distinguished under the dissecting microscope and are characteristic of the pelvic nerve, as none of the other major nerves associated with the ganglion show this clear fasciculation.\nIdentify the hypogastric nerve by visualizing the following landmarks and features.\n\t\t\nIdentify where the hypogastric nerve joins the ganglion at its cranial edge, after travelling alongside the ureter.\nConfirm that the hypogastric nerve is much thinner than either the pelvic or cavernous nerves and is not accompanied by large vessels.\nIdentify the cavernous nerve by visualizing the following landmarks and features.\n\t\t\nAfter following the pelvic nerve to its junction with the ganglion, follow the cavernous nerve as it travels caudally along the lateral wall of the cervix towards the vagina.\nIf microscope magnification permits, note that there is a small group of delicate nerves emerging from the ganglion between the pelvic and cavernous nerves; these are the rectal nerves that travel to the lower bowel.\nIdentify the accessory nerves by visualizing the following landmarks and features.",
    "NOTE: The accessory nerves are difficult to see but project from the medial aspect of the MPG. After clearing tissue to enable visualization of the ventral edge of the ganglion, identify a cluster of very delicate nerves that project towards the urinary and reproductive tracts.\nIdentify the MPG by visualizing the following features.\n\t\t\nVisualize the ventral, dorsal, and cranial edges of the ganglion, which form a triangular shape.\nConfirm the location of each major nerve: the pelvic nerves emerging from the ganglion's dorsal edge, the cavernous nerve at the most caudal corner of the ganglion, the hypogastric nerve from its cranial edge, and the accessory nerves emerging from the ganglion's ventral edge.\nRemoval of the MPG with its associated nerves\n\t\nGently place fine-tipped angled forceps under the pelvic nerve and slide the forceps along to free it from the underlying uterine cervix and surrounding tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: It may also be possible to isolate the pelvic nerve from the small vessel running parallel to it, but for most types of experiments this is not essential. If demonstrating the dissection, place a suture under the pelvic nerve, to facilitate its visualization.\nRepeat the process for the cavernous nerve, then the hypogastric nerve, and finally the accessory nerves.\nGently slide forceps between the ganglion and the underlying uterine cervix. Disrupt any connections between the ganglion and the cervix.\nClear any final connections with surrounding tissues for the lengths of nerves required for the experiment, then cut each nerve.\nUsing fine forceps, move the ganglion with its nerves to the appropriate solution for the experiment and confirm that each of the main nerves are intact.\n3. Confirmation of ganglion components (optional)",
    "After removal of the ganglion, immerse ganglion in a conventional histological fixative (e.g., 4% buffered formalin) for a minimum of 1 h, wash out fixative with 0.1 M phosphate buffer and process tissue for cryosectioning and fluorescence immunohistochemistry, as previously described13.\n\tNOTE: Many high-quality antibodies that specifically recognize these three neural markers are commercially available. See Table of Materials for the reagents used for the labeling shown in Figure 3.\nAlternatively, process ganglia intact (wholemounts) for immunohistochemistry using a similar method as above but increasing the incubation times for the antibodies to 4 days (primary antibody) and 2 days (secondary antibody).\nTo demonstrate a major population of sensory axons, use antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).\n\tNOTE: The recommended dilution of the antibody used in this study is 1:5,000.\nTo demonstrate noradrenergic sympathetic neurons, use antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH).\n\tNOTE: The recommended dilution of the antibody used in this study is 1:5,000.\nTo demonstrate a major population of cholinergic neurons, use antibodies against neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS).\n\tNOTE: The recommended dilution of the antibody used in this study is 1:500."
