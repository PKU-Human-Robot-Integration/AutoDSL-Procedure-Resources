    "1. Preparations\nInsect cell culture\n\t\nPrepare 50 mL of cell culture medium. To do so, add 500 µL of antibiotics (Amphotericin B = 0.25 µg/mL, Penicillin = 100 unit/mL, Streptomycin = 100 µg/mL) and 5 mL of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in serum-free cell culture medium (without FBS or antibiotics).\nNOTE: Heat the fetal bovine serum at 65 °C for 30 min in a water bath before use.\nMaintain Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), sf9 insect cells. Detach ca. 80% of the cells from 25 cm2 cell culture flask by shaking the flask and check under light microscopy. Then, transfer 50% of the cell suspension to a new 25 cm2 cell culture flask and allow the cells to attach for 15 min at room temperature. Replace the medium with 5 mL fresh cell culture medium and grow in an incubator at 28 °C. Passage cells every 2 to 3 days depending on the cell growth.\nPreparation of plasmids for cell transfection\n\t\nInsert the target DNA fragments (e.g., Lymantria xylina MNPV (LyxyMNPV) iap3 gene and its deletion constructs) into pDHsp/V5-His by PCR-based cloning method11. Check the growth of transformed colonies by colony PCR using PCR Master Mix (2X) and the pDhsp-F2/Op-IE2R primer set. Confirm the plasmid sequences by commercial sequencing service.\nNOTE: Table 1 lists the primers used for PCR and the corresponding constructs.\nCulture single sequenced bacterial colonies, which contain the aforementioned plasmid constructions (step 1.2) in 200 mL LB medium containing selected antibiotics (50 µg/mL), respectively.\nExtract the plasmids from the cultured E. coli using Midi Plasmid Kit according to manufacturer's instructions12.\nPrepare plating medium by mixing 1.5 mL of cell culture medium and 8.5 mL of serum-free cell culture medium.",
    "Prepare Actinomycin D (ActD) cell culture medium by adding 1.5 µL of ActD stock (1 mg/mL) into 10 mL of cell culture medium (final concentration = 150 ng/mL). Store at 4 °C.\n2. Protein transient expression\nCell seeding\n\t\nHarvest the sf9 cells by shaking culture flask, topple and fall the cell suspension to 50 mL tube, and transfer 10 µL to hemocytometer by a P10 pipette. Count the cell number under a light microscope.\nPlate 3 × 105 sf9 cells into each well in a 24-well plate for 15 min at room temperature. Replace the medium with 0.5 mL of plating medium.\nTransfection of plasmids\n\t\nDilute cell transfection reagent: Dilute 8 µL of cell transfection reagent in 100 µL serum-free cell culture medium and mix by vortexing for 1 s.\nAdd 2 µg of plasmid DNA (pDHsp70-Ac-P35/V5-His or pDHsp70-Ly-IAP3/V5-His or pDHsp70-Ly-IAP3-BIR/V5-His or pDHsp70-Ly-IAP3-RING/V5-His) into 100 µL of serum-free cell culture medium and mix by vortexing for 1 s (Figure 2).\nCombine the diluted plasmid DNA and diluted cell transfection reagent (210 µL), and mix by vortexing for 1 s. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd 210 µL of DNA transfection reagent mixture dropwise onto the cells by a P1000 pipette. Incubate at 28 °C for 5 h.\nReplace the plating medium with 0.5 mL of cell culture medium using a P1000 pipette. Seal the 24-well plate with tape and incubate the cells at 28 °C for 16 h.\nHeat shock the transfected cells: Put the plate in a 42 °C water bath (floating on the water surface). Heat for 30 min and return the 24-well plate to the 28 °C incubator.\nDetection of protein expression\n\t\nAfter 1 h or 5 h heat shock,wash the cells with 0.5 mL of 1x PBS buffer briefly three times.",
    "NOTE: Dilute 10x PBS buffer to 1x PBS buffer by adding 1 mL of 10x PBS buffer to 9 mL sterilized ddH2O\nLyse the cells with 40 µL of 1x SDS Loading Dye by pipetting up and down.\n\t\tNOTE: Dilute 4x SDS Loading Dye by mixing 30 µL of 1x PBS buffer and 10 µL of 4x SDS Sample Buffer.\nHeat the protein samples at 98 °C for 10 min in a heat block, spin down for 1 min, and put on ice for Western blot assay.\nWestern blot assay\n\t\tFollow the procedure of Western blot assay from Eslami and Lujan13. Run SDS-PAGE gels14: one gel subjected to Coomassie blue staining (loading control for checking that the quantity of protein samples loaded in each well is equal in amount) and the other subjected to Western blot assay, according to Eslami and Lujan13.\nDetect V5-tagged fusion proteins with rabbit anti-V5 antibody (5 mg/mL) (1:5000 dilution in TBST buffer to working concentration 1 µg/mL) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (0.8 mg/mL) (1:10000 dilution in TBST buffer to working concentration 0.08 µg/mL).\nNOTE: Adjust the percentage of polyacrylamide to 17.5% when the protein molecular weight to be <17 kDa.\n3. Anti-apoptotic activity assay\nGene-induced cell apoptosis: Repeat the aforementioned procedure from 2.1 to 2.3.
