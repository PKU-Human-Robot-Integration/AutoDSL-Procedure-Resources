    "The following procedures were approved by the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute Animal Care Committee in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC).\n1. Preparation\nStudy\n(Critical) Prior to performing any experiment, obtain the appropriate approvals (e.g., IACUC) and trainings (e.g., animal handling).\nFamiliarize yourself with the equipment and the operating software. Read the user manuals and, if needed, create a configuration file to define the number of sites, input signals, analyzers, and parameters.\nNote: Make sure to select a high sampling rate (2 KHz).\nConfigure the analyzers settings for the parameters of interest.\n\t\t\nSelect Tuning from the tool bar and then Analyzers.\nAdjust the flow threshold to a value that correctly separates the breaths (mouse: 0.5 mL/s) and opt for Ti + Te to compute the breathing rate.\nSet a value for the barometric pressure (760 mm Hg) and specify the maximal deviation of inspiratory/expiratory volume for a breath to be considered valid (mouse: 20%).\nClick on Setting in the Calculated parameters field to adjust the limits of acceptance.\nNote: The following settings were used for the described mouse experiments: Inspiration time, 50 to 170 ms; expiration time, 40 to 180 ms; frequency of breathing, 30 to 450 bpm; specific airway resistance, 0 to 15 cmH2O·s; midexpiratory flow with a precision of at least 3 decimals.\nOnce completed, select Apply and Close to exit the dialog window.\nFrom the tool bar menu, go to Tuning again and then Storage to set a desired data storage rate. Click on Apply and Close to exit the window.\nNote: An average at every 10 s is typically used.\nCreate a protocol within the operating software to define a sequence of commands and the desired timing for each one. An example is displayed in Figure 1.",
    "If the experiment involves the administration of a substance by aerosol, prepare the appropriate solutions and dilutions according to the concentrations to be tested.\nAnimal\nWork in a quiet area remote from the housing room. Allow the animals to adjust to the change of environment.\nWeigh the animals and select the appropriate restraint size.\n(Critical) Acclimate the animals to the restrainer and procedures prior to the start of the experiment. Depending on the experimental design, multiple acclimation sessions of increasing duration (e.g., 5-30 min) may be needed.\nNote: Animals that do not acclimate should be removed from the study.\n\t\t\nAt each acclimation session, insert the animal within the restrainer, proceeding from the back opening; holding the device vertically can be helpful.\nOnce the animal is in position, insert the back plunger and gently lock it in place without applying an excessive force.\n(Critical) Visually check that the animal breathes normally. If needed, adjust its position by moving the locking mechanism. Make sure that the animal's nares are protruding outside of the nose-cone with its snout resting against the inner walls of the restrainer.\nDetach the back panel of the thoracic chamber, insert the restrainer containing the animal through the rubber opening in the thoracic chamber, and close the chamber.\nAttach the head chamber and provide a bias flow. Use a flow of 0.5 L/min for a mouse.\nAllow the animal to relax for 5 min.\nOnce the animal is calm, start the recording of the nasal and thoracic flow signals. Verify on the computer screen that the traces are smooth and that they display a regular breathing pattern; see example in Figure 2.\nNote: If the protocol involves the aerosol administration of a substance, a saline challenge can be included in the acclimation procedure.",
    "At the end of each session, remove the animal from the thoracic chamber and the restrainer and return it to its housing cage and room.\nEquipment\nOn the day of the experiment, start an experimental session and load the appropriate configuration file.\nNote: Verify that it contains the desired protocol for the experiment.\nGo to Run in the tool bar menu. Enter the experiment and animal's information. Once done, click on the Run button at the bottom of the window.\nProceed with the calibration of the system. Calibrate each site and input signal separately.\n\t\t\nTurn on the bias flow generator, connect it to the head chamber via a piece of tubing, and adjust the flow rate.\nClose the top opening of the head chamber with a cap.\nDetach the back panel of thoracic chamber, firmly insert the calibration tool inside the rubber opening between the head and the body chamber to create a hermetic seal. Then close and re-attach the back panel of the thoracic chamber.\nVerify that the side port of the thoracic chamber is capped.\nFrom the software tool bar menu, go to Tuning and then Calibrate.\nGo to Input 1 (thoracic) and select Calibrate to launch the calibration dialog box for the thoracic flow signal.\n(Critical) Verify that the listed parameters in the calibration dialog window display the appropriate settings, i.e., Physical stress applied low value: 0; Physical stress applied high value: -20 mL/s; Samples: Integrate. Once done, click on Low in the Samples window.\nVerify that the signal generated is constant across the display window and then click on Close.\nConnect a 20 mL-syringe through the side port of the thoracic chamber using a plastic connector and a piece of tubing.",
    "(Critical) Select High in the Samples window and immediately inject 20 mL of air into the chamber over a 2 s period at a flow rate as constant as possible.\nVerify that the signal generated appears completely inside the display window. Use the arrow icon to verify whether the signal is centered and symmetric around the zero line. Then, click on Close. Remove any offset from zero by clicking on Remove AC offset in the Samples window\nNote: The high value calibration can be redone, if needed.\nVerify that the resulting Scaled Input Range is within the recommended range (mouse: ±280 to ±420 mL/s). (Critical) Repeat the calibration steps if the values are outside the acceptable range.\nCalibrate the head chamber in a similar manner as the thoracic chamber (step 1.3.3.6). This time, select Input 2 (nasal).\nNote: (Important) The value for Physical stress applied high value must be set to +20 mL/s. This will change the polarity of the flow in the front chamber in relation to the rear chamber. Hence, when the animal is breathing, the two flow signals will almost be in phase, aside from the delay used to calculate sRaw.\n2. Lung Function Measurements\nWeigh the animals and note their body weights.\nInsert the animal within the restrainer and place it inside the thoracic plethysmograph chamber (Steps 1.2.3.1 to 1.2.3.5).\nAllow the animal to relax for at least 5 min.\nStart the protocol of commands by selecting the first step and then, click on Execute.\nCheck on the computer screen that the animal's breathing signals are regular and smooth (Figure 2). The software automatically displays the calculated parameters on a breath-by-breath basis. Verify that the animal's parameters are stable.\nRecord the breathing pattern under baseline conditions for up to 10 minutes.",
    "For protocols involving the administration of a test substance by aerosol, do as follows:\n\t\nAdjust the nebulizer on-time and duty cycle, as required.\nNote: In the examples demonstrated in this article, the nebulizer was operated at a 5% duty cycle for 10 s.\nPerform a vehicle challenge (e.g., saline) and record the response.\nIf needed, expose the animal to increasing concentrations of the test substance by changing the concentration in the nebulizer in escalating steps (e.g., doubling concentrations). Record the response after each administration.\nAt the end of the experimental session, if not done automatically, stop the recording and return the animal to its housing cage and room.\nIf needed, select Run from the tool bar menu to run another experimental session.\n\t\nBetween sessions, clean the plethysmograph chambers and rinse the nebulizer with water.\nNote: The use of alcohol may cause irreversible damage to the plethysmograph.\nIf the study involves repeated evaluations over time, repeat the whole measurement sequence at each chosen timepoint.\nNote: It is wisely recommended to complement the study with some precise measurements of respiratory mechanics and/or lung volumes1,15.\n3. Data Analysis\nNote: The software automatically saves the experimental file and exports the recorded parameters when the experimental session is closed.\nCalculate a baseline average for the parameters of interest for each animal and experimental group.\nNote: Table 1 lists a number of typical parameters, categorized based on the type of information they provide.\nWhen relevant, evaluate the effect of the aerosolized substance studied on the parameters of interest at each concentration using a specific point (e.g., maximal or minimal value), an average, or the full time-course; a normalization to baseline can also be considered.\nReport the results using the group means and errors in a table or graphic format. Analyze the results statistically.",
    "Note: In the present study, two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures were used to assess the effect of methacholine, the allergen – house-dust mite (HDM) –  and their interaction on different DCP readouts (sRaw and EF50), as well as on different FOT readouts (RN, G and H), in both strains of mice. Sidak’s multiple comparison tests were then used to determine the concentrations of methacholine at which the allergic mice differ from the control mice. The same tests were used to assess the effect of days, HDM and their interaction at baseline (i.e., before methacholine) on readouts of airway obstruction (sRaw and EF50) and of ventilation pattern (BF, TV, MV and EIP). Pearson’s correlations were used to evaluate the correlations between sRaw obtained with the DCP and RN obtained with the FOT. All statistical analyses and graphs were performed using alternative standard statistical software (e.g., GraphPad Prism). p ≤ 0.05 was considered sufficient to reject the null hypothesis."
