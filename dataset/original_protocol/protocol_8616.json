    "1. Solutions Used for Brain Dissection and Immunofluorescent Staining\nDissect the adult fly brains in artificial Cerebral Spinal Fluid (aCSF): 119 mM NaCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.3 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM glucose. Before use, gas the aCSF with 5% CO2/95% O2 for 10 - 15 min and spike with 2.5 mM CaCl2. Sterilize the aCSF solution by filtering through a 0.22 µm membrane filter.\nNote: Store aCSF at 4 °C to prevent bacterial contamination. Fly brains can also be dissected in a Phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS) solution, although detailed comparisons of the effects of the two dissection solutions on the final imaging quality of the dissected brains have not been performed.\nUse 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) prepared in 1x PBS as the fixative solution, which is normally aliquoted and stored at -20 °C.\nCaution: PFA is toxic and corrosive and should be handled with care.\nUse 1x PBS to rinse the PFA from the brains and after the last washing step, during the immunofluorescent staining of the dissected brains. Prepare the 1x PBS from 10x PBS stock solution (1.37 M NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 100 mM Na2HPO4, and 18 mM KH2PO4).\nUse 0.3% Tween-20 in 1x PBS (1x PBT) for all the subsequent washing steps during immunofluorescent staining of the dissected brains.\n2. Microsurgical Dissection of Adult Fly Heads\nNote: The dissection procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.\nAnesthetize the adult flies with CO2. Using forceps, pick up a fly and briefly dewax its cuticle by dipping it in 70% ethanol for 3 - 5 s. This ensures that no bubbles adhere to the fly cuticle when immersed in the aCSF or 1X PBS dissection solution.",
    "Under a dissecting microscope with a light source at an angle that will not be blocked by hands, set the objective lens to attain a clear view of the fly (1.2X magnification). Use forceps with the nondominant hand to immobilize the animal and immerse the fly into the cold dissection solution with its abdomen facing upwards, as shown in Figure 1A.\nKeep the forceps at a 160 - 170° angle with respect to the dissection plate, while exerting a small force onto the abdomen of the fly (illustrated as arrows in Figure 1A). This step will immobilize the fly and force it to move the head backwards by 15 - 25° while extending the proboscis upwards. In the process, a soft and translucent region of the cuticle, underneath the proboscis, should become apparent. Increase the magnification and adjust the focal plane onto this region.\nNote: Do not hold the forceps too tightly, but rather just firm enough to stabilize the fly. Too much force will cause the inside organs to rupture into the solution.\nUse the dominant hand to press the dissecting forceps so that its tips are closed, which will generate a mild resistant force on the tips of the forceps, so that the forceps will spring open when pressure from the holding hand is released. Position the forceps perpendicularly to the forceps holding the fly, as shown in Figure 1B.\n\t\nPierce the closed tips of the dissection forceps through the soft and translucent region of the cuticle underneath the proboscis, as illustrated by the red arrow in Figure 1B. It is important not to penetrate the forceps too deeply that it touches the brain. The brain proper should become visible. Maintain a stable grasp of the fly with the nondominant hand.",
    "Quickly but steadily, release the tips of the dissection forceps by its own force and rely on the momentum from this release to tear away the exoskeleton surrounding the fly head. An intact brain proper should become visible (the white tissue immediately above the tip of the bottom forcep in Figure 1C) Follow an imaginary line to guide the momentum of the released forcep tips (illustrated as the outward red arrows shown in Figure 1C). This will gently remove the exoskeleton and most of the brain-associated eye and trachea from the brain. The proper timing and force applied to open the exoskeleton will be dependent on the investigator's experience.\nNote: This is the most critical step during the dissection. It is important to rely on the natural force generated from the momentum of the opening forceps to remove the exoskeleton while leaving the exposed brain remains attached to the rest of the body.\nUse the forceps in the dominant hand to carefully remove the remnant accessory tissues, such as the tracheal that appears as white fiber structures remaining attached to the brain. Be careful not to pull or damage the brain proper.\n3. Immunofluorescent Staining of the Brains\nFix the dissected brain samples with their associated torsos in approximately 1 mL of 4% PFA for 40 - 60 min.\nNote: For this and subsequent steps, keep the tubes or plates with samples on a nutator to properly mix the samples in the solution.\nRinse with 1 mL of 1x PBS by pipetting the solution up and down 3 times. Be careful not to aspirate the brains away.\nWash 5 times with 1x PBT for 5 min each. Keep the samples on the nutator during incubation.\nIncubate with primary antibodies at proper dilution O/N at 4 °C.",
    "The next day, remove the primary antibodies, and wash the samples 5 times with 1x PBT. Leave the samples for 5 - 10 min in the 1x PBT solution in between each wash. Keep the samples on the nutator during incubation.\nIncubate the washed samples in appropriate secondary antibodies with the suggested dilution and time of incubation.\nWash the samples six times with 1x PBT with a 10 min incubation between each wash.\n\tThis step is critical for the removal of nonspecifically bound secondary antibodies from the sample.\nIncubate in a 1:10,000 dilution of 1 mg/mL 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in 1x PBT solution for 30 min. DAPI is a DNA dye that binds to the AT regions of DNA and can be used to reveal the overall morphology of the brain.\nRinse three times with 1x PBS.\nTransfer samples to a dissection dish, and separate the brains from the bodies in a dissection dish using forceps.\nAfter the staining and washing steps, mount the brains in between two coverslips and place the coverslips on top of a mounting slide. In this way, the brain samples can be easily flipped so that both sides of the brain can be imaged with a similar signal intensity.\nNote: Mounting the brain on the coverslip instead of directly on the mounting slide allows flipping of the sample's orientation freely. The mounting process is explained in more detail below.\n\t\nPlace an 18 x 18 mm coverslip on top of a mounting slide. Widen the opening of a pipette tip with a blade and use it to transfer the brains in 1x PBS solution onto the 18 x 18 mm coverslip.",
    "Place the brains on the middle of the coverslip, remove the liquid around the brains with a fine pipette tip, and then add another 20 - 40 µL of anti-fade mounting medium (0.2% (w/v) n-propyl gallate in 99.5% ACS grade glycerol) over the brains.\nNote: The amount of mounting medium added depends on the number of brains examined.\nGently spread out the brains while displacing the viscous mounting medium outwards. Place a second 18 x 18 mm coverslip on top of the brains by first lowering the slide from one side until it makes contact with the surface of the mounting slip, and then slowly lowering the other side to minimize brain contact with air bubbles. \nNote: There is no need to use a spacer in between the two coverslips, as the volume of the mounting medium and the brains should provide a space sufficient to separate the two coverslips.\nAllow the slides to settle down. Remove excessive liquid that come out from the sides of the slips with a laboratory tissue.\nTo prevent the coverslips with the mounted brains from falling off the mounting slide during transportation, use a small piece of tape to attach the coverslips to the mounting slide.\nNote: Brains mounted in between the slides can be imaged immediately or preserved at 4 °C for up to one week without significant loss of fluorescent signal, without a need to use any sealant to seal the slides. For long-term preservation of the stained brains, the side of the two slips can be sealed with nail polish and stored in a -20 °C freezer, although stained brains might lose their signals over time. This is not recommended.\nUse an appropriate compound fluorescent microscope or confocal microscope to image the brains.",
    "First, acquire the image from the side of the brain closer to the objective, and then carefully flip the coverslips to have the samples sandwiched in the middle. This step facilitates acquiring the image of the other side of the same brain.\nUse an upright compound fluorescent microscope and a 20X objective lens to image the whole brain (examples in Figure 2) and a 40X objective to image smaller regions of the brain, such as DA neurons in the Paired Anterior Medial (PAM) cluster region (examples in Figure 3).\nSubscription Required.
