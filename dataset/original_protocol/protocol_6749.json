    "Preparation of tissue lysatePrepare mouse liver lysate as diluent for MSD calibration curve standardsPerfuse an adult mouse liver with PBS, pH 7.4 (see Note 2) through the portal vein until the color of liver turns yellow or white (Cabral et al., 2018). Cut off the liver tissue and weigh on an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo).Freeze the liver tissue in liquid nitrogen and pulverize it using a liquid nitrogen cooled mortar and pestle Cryo-cup grinder (Biospec).Add ice-chilled MSD lysis buffer to the pulverized liver tissue in the amount of 2 ml of buffer per 100 mg of tissue. Homogenized the tissue with a motor-driven Teflon coated mortar and pestle tissue grinder, size B (Thomas Scientific) on ice, at a speed of 740 rpm for 30 strokes.Transfer the homogenate to 2-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 16K rcf, 4 °C, for 15 min with a refrigerated centrifuge (Eppendorf).Transfer the supernatant (liver lysate) to a new tube without disturbing the precipitation (containing nuclei and cellular debris) and avoid taking any fat or oil droplet floating on the surface of the lysate. Keep the supernatant on ice.Measure the protein concentration of liver lysate following a protocol using the Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce, see Note 3). The protein concentration typically ranges from 5 to 7 mg/ml for liver lysate obtained from this process. Adjust protein concentration to 4 mg/ml with the MSD lysis buffer.Prepare mouse brain lysate for MSD calibration curve standards and for test samplesPrepare brain lysate for standards using adult mouse brains, as NaV1.1 expression is developmentally regulated and stays at a high level in adulthood (Han et al., 2020). Prepare brain lysate in similar way as liver lysate, except that brain tissue is not pulverized in liquid nitrogen before homogenization, and 1.",
    "5-ml of MSD lysis buffer is added to every 100 mg of brain tissue. Smaller sized Teflon coated mortar and pestle tissue grinder, size A (Thomas Scientific) could be used for homogenization of test samples. The protein concentration typically ranges from 5 to 7 mg/ml for brain lysate obtained from this process. At the end of preparation, adjust the concentration of brain lysate to 4 mg/ml with MSD lysis buffer.Qualification and characterization of MSD-ECL assayValidate the specificity of antibodies with Scn1a-/- mouse brain tissue (see Note 4).Prepare brain lysate from Scn1a-/- mice and wild type (WT) littermates. We bred the Scn1atm1Kea 129S6.Scn1a+/− mice (The Jackson Laboratory) to create Scn1a-/- mice. Alternatively, NaV1.1 null tissue could be obtained from CRISPR engineered Scn1a knock-out cell culture.Perform SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) with 50 µg of brain lysate on each lane of a precast TGX acrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Run SDS-PAGE at 120 V for ~90 min.Transfer total protein to a 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) with a dry blotting system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Use the following transfer program for protein transfer: step 1: 20 V for 1 min; step 2: 23 V for 4 min; step 3: 25 V for 5 min.Perform immunoblotting with the test antibodies. Block the membrane with 2% ECL Prime blocking reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for 30 min. Use Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) to prepare the blocking buffer. Use the blocking buffer as diluent for primary and secondary antibodies incubation. Wash the nitrocellulose membrane with TBS-T between antibody incubation. Develop immunoblotting signals with the ECL Plus Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and capture the immunoblot images with a laser scanner (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Antibodies specific to NaV1.",
    "1 should detect a protein band at about 223 kDa with WT mouse brain lysate but not with Scn1a-/- mouse brain lysate. An example of NaV1.1 specific antibody validation is given in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3910/bioprotoc-11-xx-3910-g002.jpgFigure 2. Examples of NaV1.1 antibody validation. Immunoblotting was performed with brain lysate from a Scn1a-/- mouse (mid lane) and two wild type (WT) littermates (flanking lanes). The NaV1.1 antibody from vendor A (left panel) is not specific and may cross react with other VGSCs homologs. The NaV1.1 antibody from vendor B (right panel) is specific since NaV1.1 protein band is not seen in the lane of Scn1a-/- brain lysate. Therefore, NaV1.1 antibody from Vendor B is found to be suitable for MSD-ECL assay development. (Protein ladder: PageRuller Plus)Evaluation of mouse liver lysate as diluent for MSD calibration curve standardsPerform SDS-PAGE with 50 µg of mouse liver lysate or brain lysate on each lane. Transfer total protein to a 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane and perform immunoblotting with a validated NaV1.1 antibody. Antibodies specific to NaV1.1 should detect a protein band about 223 kDa with brain lysate but not with the diluent (liver lysate in this case). Results confirming mouse liver lysate as a suitable diluent for brain lysate are shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3910/bioprotoc-11-xx-3910-g003.jpgFigure 3. Evaluation of mouse liver lysate as diluent for brain lysate. Immunoblotting was performed with mouse liver lysate and brain lysate with a validated NaV1.1 antibody (from vendor B, the same antibody as in Figure 2). Vinculin immunoblotting was shown for loading control. (Protein ladder: PageRuller Plus)Preparation of MSD calibration curve standardsPrepare MSD calibration curve standards by mixing WT mouse brain lysate (4 mg/ml) and WT mouse liver lysate (4 mg/ml) at various ratios (Table 1).",
    "Store MSD calibration curve standards in small aliquots at -80 °C to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles (see Note 5).Table 1. Preparation of calibration curve standards (STDs)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210201/20210201232231_1106.jpg Characterization and acceptance criteria for the MSD-ECL assayAccuracy and precisionPerform MSD-ECL assay with standards and quality controls (QCs) in duplicate wells. We typically prepare high concentration quality control (HQC) at 70-75% level and medium concentration quality control (MQC) at 45-55% level of the largest non-zero calibrator (STD12 in this case). We prepare low concentration quality control (LQC) approximately 3 times the smallest non-zero calibrator (STD2 in this case). Prepare the QCs using mouse liver lysate as diluent (see Note 5).As a measure of assay accuracy (A), the mean back-calculated concentrations for all standards should be ± 15% of their nominal values. 75% of the non-zero standards should meet the above criteria. The mean back-calculated concentrations for QCs should be ± 20% of their nominal values.As a measure of assay precision (P), the % CV between duplicates should be ≤ 20%.Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and upper limit of quantification (ULOQ)LLOQ is defined by the smallest non-zero calibrator with MSD signal at least 3 times greater than the blank (STD1) or greater than blank plus 10 times the standard deviation (SD) of the blank. LLOQ should meet the accuracy and precision criteria.ULOQ is defined by the largest non-zero calibrator (STD12 in this case) that meets the accuracy and precision criteria.SpecificityPerform MSD-ECL assay with brain lysate from Scn1a-/- mouse following steps in Procedure C. The MSD signal from Scn1a-/- brain lysate should be below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ).Dilution linearityThe three QC samples (HQC, MQC and LQC) serve the purpose of evaluating the dilution linearity of the assay.",
    "If more stringent test is desired, MSD-ECL assay could be performed with 4 or more levels of dilution for the QC samples. The mean back-calculated concentrations for QCs should be ± 20% of their nominal values.Establishment of dilution linearity helps to extend the dynamic range of the standard curve beyond 100% of NaV1.1 expression in WT mouse brain. Test samples for which anticipated NaV1.1 expression is higher than WT mouse brain tissues or showing levels above ULOQ can be diluted using the established dilution factors.Storage stabilityStore standards and QCs at -80 °C and perform MSD-ECL assay in 1 week, 1 month and 3 months (or longer as appropriate for the study). The mean back-calculated concentrations for all standards and QCs should be ± 15% and ± 20% of their nominal values respectively, while both passing the precision criteria.Performing MSD-ECL assayBlock the MSD GAM (goat anti-mouse antibody) plates with 5% MSD blocker B (see Note 6) in Tris-Buffered Saline, 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), 100 µl/well. Seal the plates and shake on a microplate shaker (Corning) for 1 h, at room temperature, speed 700 rpm.Tap blocker B out of the plates over a stack of paper towels. Coat the wells with capture antibody (NeuroMab, 0.95 mg/ml, dilute to 1:200 in 5% Block B/TBS-T), 25 µl/well. Seal the plates and shake for 4 h at room temperature, speed 700 rpm.Tap the capture antibody out of plates over paper towels. Wash the wells with TBS-T (150 µl/well) for 3 times while shaking the plates, at room temperature, speed 700 rpm. Five minutes for each wash.Add 25 µl of MSD calibration curve standard (4 mg/ml) or test sample lysate (4 mg/ml) to individual wells. Include high, medium and low concentration quality controls (HQC, MQC and LQC, respectively) on the same plate.",

Seal the plates, shake overnight, at 4 °C, speed 700 rpm.Tap the content out of plates over paper towels. Wash the wells with TBS-T (150 µl/well), for 3 times while shaking the plates, at room temperature, speed 700 rpm. Five minutes for each wash.Add 25 µl of detection antibody (Alomone, 0.6 mg/ml, dilute to 1:250 in 5% Block B/TBS-T) to each well.

Five minutes for each wash.Add 150 µl of 1× MSD Read Buffer T (diluted in dH2O) to each well. Make sure bubbles are not created when dispensing the read buffer. Read the plates immediately on a Meso Quickplex SQ 120 machine with the MSD Discovery Workbench 4.0 software (Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3910/bioprotoc-11-xx-3910-g004.jpgFigure 4. Example of plate layout for a 96-well MSD-ECL assay. Each standard (STD) and test sample (SPL) was run as duplicate. High, medium and low concentration quality controls (HQC, MQC and LQC, respectively) are included in the plate.",
    "One can also run one standard curve and one set of QCs before the test samples and the second set of standard curve and QCs at the end of the test samples."
