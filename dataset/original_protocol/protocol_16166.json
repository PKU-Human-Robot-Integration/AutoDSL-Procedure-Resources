    "In this protocol, the stable and reproducible generation of 3D retinal organoids is described. The human embryonic stem cell line H9 is differentiated to 3D retinal organoids using a combination of two already published protocols (Browne et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-bib-0004]; Kuwahara et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-bib-0022]) with some modifications. This protocol describes the procedure for one 70%-80% confluent well of a 6-well plate. Briefly, 12,000 single cells are seeded into each well of a 96-well U-bottom plate (low-adhesion). The formed organoids are transferred to a 48-well flat-bottom plate coated with agarose at day 21 (d21), keeping one organoid per well during long-term culturing (>22 weeks), which prevents fusion of organoids and improves medium supply and monitoring of organoids. Using this protocol, retinal organoids with all seven retinal cell types are obtained. One has to be aware that bipolar and Müller glia cells are late-born cell types, and therefore will appear after d126 of culturing. However, at this time there will be no ganglion cells left, as they disappear over time, probably because of malnutrition (diffusion of the medium into the inner organoid decreases with time). Figures 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0002] illustrate the different stages of the differentiation process.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f5515cdb-b995-4c9e-8b2c-097da8f3afdf/cpsc120-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1",

All colonies are lifted from the bottom and start dissociating. The picture of the 12,000 cells was taken immediately after seeding into a 96-well U-bottom plate. Scale bar: 200 µm. d1: One organoid has formed in each well of the 96-well U-bottom plate at d1. Before medium change, a ring of single cells around the organoid is detectable. These cells were not included in the organoid. The size of the ring can vary from setup to setup and cell line to cell line. After medium change, these “unused” single cells are gone, as they were aspirated. Scale bar: 200 µm.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3507a618-abb7-40a5-a88d-ecc161594dc4/cpsc120-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nDifferentiation timeline for retinal organoids.

Prepare 10 ml of medium M0 as described in Reagents and Solutions (Table 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-tbl-0008]).\n4. Wash the cells (one well of a 6-well plate) with 2 ml D-PBS (room temperature), aspirate, and add 1 ml Accutase to the well.\n5. Incubate for 5-10 min at 37°C (in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator).\n6. Place 2 ml of DMEM/F12-GlutaMAXTM Supplement with 20 µM Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor (prepared in step 1) in a 15-ml tube during the incubation in step 5.\n7. Confirm under the microscope that all cells are detached (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0001]). After 10 min, all cells should be detached—do not incubate for longer.\n8. Transfer cell suspension (1 ml) into the prepared tube (step 6) and rinse the well with 1 ml of the rest of DMEM/F12-GlutaMAXTM Supplement containing 20 µM Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor (the 15-ml tube contains now 4 ml). Avoid too much pipetting, as cells are very sensitive—transfer cells all at once and rinse one to two times.\n9. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 × g, room temperature.\n10. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml AggreWell medium containing 20 µM Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor (prepared in step 2). Do not pipette too much, as cells are very sensitive (this depends on the cell line used).\n11. Count viable cells using a hemocytometer (see Current Protocols article: Phelan & May, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-bib-0030]).",
    "12. Prepare 8 ml cell suspension with 1.6 × 105 cells/ml using medium M0 (prepared in step 3).\n13. Count viable cells again using a hemocytometer (optional).\nThe result should be ∼1.6 × 105 cells/ml.\n14. Pipette 75 µl (12,000 cells) of cell suspension into each well of a 96-well U-bottom plate (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0001]) and place the plate in the incubator.\nDo not forget to harvest cells at d0 for mycoplasma testing; usually, the rest of cells not needed for seeding should be sufficient.\nd1\n15. Prepare 60 ml of medium M1 as described in Reagents and Solutions (Table 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-tbl-0008]). Add IWR1-endo, SB-431542, and LDN-193189 to 10 ml of M1 at final concentrations of 3 µM, 10 µM, and 100 nM, respectively, and perform a complete medium change on the cells from step 14. To do that, aspirate the medium carefully without destroying the built organoid and carefully add 100 µl of the prepared medium to each well using a repetitive pipette (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0001]).\nFor a medium change, always tilt the plate toward you so that the visible organoid sinks to the edge, and aspirate the medium as much as possible (complete medium change) or take off the given amount of medium (half-medium change).\n16. Place the plate in the incubator until d6.\nd6\n17. Add BMP4 to 20 ml of M1 for a final concentration of 55 ng/ml and perform a complete medium change on the cells. Aspirate the medium carefully without destroying the organoid, and carefully add 200 µl of the prepared medium to each well using a repetitive pipette.\n18. Place the plate in the incubator until d9.\nd9 and d12",
    "19. Perform a half-medium change on d9 as well as on d12 (on each day a total of 10 ml of medium M1 is needed). Carefully take off 100 µl medium without disturbing the organoid using a 200-µl pipette and carefully add 100 µl of medium M1 using a multichannel pipette and a reagent reservoir (add 10 ml of medium to the reagent reservoir).\n20. Place the plate in the incubator until d12 and d15, respectively.\nd15\n21. Prepare 60 ml of medium M2 as described in Reagents and Solutions (Table 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-tbl-0008]).\n22. Add CHIR99021 and SU5402 to 20 ml of M2 at final concentrations of 3 µM and 5 µM, respectively, and perform a complete medium change on the cells. Aspirate almost all medium carefully without disturbing the organoid, and carefully add 200 µl of the prepared medium to each well using a repetitive pipette.\n23. Place the plate in the incubator until d16.\nd16\n24. Add CHIR99021 and SU5402 to 10 ml of M2 at final concentrations of 3 µM and 5 µM, respectively, and perform a half-medium change on the cells. Take off 100 µl of the medium carefully, without disturbing the organoid, using a 200-µl pipette, and carefully add 100 µl of the prepared medium to each well using a multichannel pipette and a reagent reservoir (add 10 ml of medium to the reagent reservoir).\n25. Place the plate in the incubator until d19.\nd19\n26. Add CHIR99021 and SU5402 to 20 ml of M2 for final concentrations of 3 µM and 5 µM, respectively, and perform a complete medium change on the cells. Carefully aspirate as much as possible of the medium without destroying the organoid, and gently add 200 µl of the prepared medium to each well using a repetitive pipette.",
    "27. Place the plate in the incubator until d21.\nd21\n28. Prepare 380 ml medium M3 as described in Reagents and Solutions (Table 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-tbl-0008]).\nThis is the amount that will be needed for 2 weeks. Store at 4°C\n29. Coat two 48-well flat-bottom plates with 1% agarose dissolved in ultra-pure water. Weigh 1 g agarose and dissolve in 100 ml ultra-pure water, then boil in the microwave until agarose is completely dissolved. Let it cool down a bit and pipette 300 µl into each well. Add retinoic acid (RA) to 50 ml of medium M3 for a final concentration of 0.5 µM, and add 400 µl of the prepared medium to each well using a repetitive pipette when agarose has hardened (the rest of the prepared medium is needed in step 30).\nAs retinoic acid is light sensitive, the light should be turned off during the medium change.\n30. Perform a complete medium change. Aspirate the medium carefully without destroying the organoid, and carefully add 100 µl of medium M3 containing freshly added 0.5 µM retinoic acid to each well of the 96-well U-bottom plate using a repetitive pipette (use 10 ml of the medium prepared in step 29).\n31. Transfer each organoid to a well of the 48-well flat-bottom plates (step 29)—each organoid is kept separately. If you started with a full 96-well U-bottom plate at d0, you will need two 48-well flat-bottom plates at this step. For the transfer use a 200 µl pipette with tips that were cut (sterile; size of opening should be ∼3 mm as the organoids at this point have a size of ∼1-1.5 mm) so that the organoid will not be destroyed.\nThe transfer is necessary because the organoids grow and need more medium.",
    "The tips should be cut under sterile conditions (use sterile scissors, cut under laminar flow hood).\nKeeping one organoid per well avoids fusion and building of chains of several organoids, which is seen when organoids are cultured together in a 10-cm dish. Moreover, monitoring of organoids is improved, as the development of each organoid can be followed separately.\n32. Place the plate in the incubator until d23.\nd23\n33. Add retinoic acid to 60 ml of medium M3 for a final concentration of 0.5 µM and perform a complete medium change every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for long-term culturing until d152 or beyond. Aspirate the medium carefully without destroying the organoid and carefully add 600 µl of the prepared medium to each well using a repetitive pipette. The last addition of retinoic acid is on d119.\nAt later time points, some of the organoids might break into several small organoids that have a nice bright retinal layer (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0003]). Immunostaining of these small organoids reveal normal results.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9650bf74-3bed-47f4-8a67-b2c0b41c0a32/cpsc120-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nOrganoids can fall apart into several smaller organoids during differentiation. Some organoids might disintegrate during differentiation. In this case, several smaller organoids can be observed in a single well. All of these smaller organoids have a bright outer layer. Scale bar: 500 µm.\n34. Harvest organoids for RNA and DNA analysis and embedding/immunofluorescent staining at desired time points during differentiation. Embed and section as in Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-prot-0003], then proceed to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-prot-0002].\nLight-microscopic images of the organoids are also advantageous for monitoring retinal differentiation.",
    "Detailed analysis of, e.g., cell composition, spatial cell organization, and cell proliferation in the in vitro–generated retinal organoids is performed by immunostaining of cryosections (which generally result in better detection of antigens compared to paraffin sections) of the organoids (Fischer, Jacobson, Rose, & Zeller, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-bib-0012]; Hira et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-bib-0018]). Presence, absence, localization, and distribution of certain cell types can be determined by using specific antibodies for marker proteins (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0004]). This protocol is based on Browne et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-bib-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5d85ef49-d536-43bc-b777-d1791de0df5b/cpsc120-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nImmunostaining for early retinal markers and all retinal cell types. At d35, the outer layer stains positive for the early eye field marker RX. Moreover, in the outer part, retinal progenitor cells (VSX2), and in the inner part, ganglion cells are present (BRN3). CRX, a marker for retinal progenitors and immature photoreceptors, is present at d35, and a shift to the outer layer can be detected at d61. Horizontal cells (PROX1) and amacrine cells (AP2α) are present in the inner nuclear layer (d61, d126). Cone photoreceptors (RXRγ, ARR3; d96, d126, d152) and rod photoreceptors (NRL; d152) are present in the outer nuclear layer. Bipolar cells (PKCα) and Müller glia cells (VIM) are present in the inner nuclear layer (d152). A schematic overview of the retina with the seven different cell types organized in specific layers is given.

    "Good embedding is essential for good sectioning.

Avoid air bubbles. Immediately fill up the rest of the tissue mold with fresh O.C.T. compound and let it freeze on dry ice (∼15-30 min; Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0005]).\nIf air bubbles occur in the tissue mold, remove them immediately with a pipette tip.\n9. Wrap up the tissue mold in aluminum foil that has been labeled, and keep the cryo-block at −80°C overnight.\n10. Section the cryoblock using a cryotome (prepare 10-µm sections). As soon as you have reached the organoid, you will see white/yellowish tissue in the cryoblock and on the test slide. From this point on, place six sections on a labeled Superfrost slide, as shown in Figure 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0005]. Two sections will be one staining area (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0005]). Store slides at −80°C until used for immunostaining.",
    "In order to use immunostaining to analyze possible differences regarding specific cell types, it is necessary to quantify either cell number or the area of specifically labeled fluorescence signals. This protocol describes how to quantify cell numbers using macros in Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-bib-0032]). For quantitation, TIFF images are acquired on a confocal microscope. In this case, a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope is used, and according to experience, a pixel size of 150 nm is set as default. However, this may vary depending on the microscope used. To increase precision, at least four pictures are taken per organoid, with three organoids per differentiation and three biological replicates of differentiations (36 images in total). As the described macro is based on a DAPI mask, it is mandatory to take an image of the DAPI channel for each picture to make sure that only nucleated cells are included into the results.",
    "On the DAPI channel image, a watershed algorithm will be performed which is only sufficient to separate sparsely touching cell-cell events in a single cell layer derived from, e.g., cell culture slides. However, in thicker tissue slices, more than one layer of cells will be present, and the density of nuclei will be too high for precise quantitation of single cells. The DAPI area will be eroded by a fixed factor to mimic the true size of a cell. Subsequently, a mask for the fluorescent signal of the immunostaining will be created by a fixed threshold value that is to be tested by the user for each condition. It is also important to adapt the macro for different cellular localizations of the fluorescence staining. In the next step, the fluorescence marker label will be compared with the previously created nuclei mask. Only signals within the DAPI mask will be used for final outputs. After thresholds have been determined for a staining, all images can be processed as a batch. The results table of the macro script will show absolute cell numbers and area values (integrated density). Depending on the type of slides/samples used—monolayer cell culture slides or tissue sections—the respective number can be used for calculations. Calculation of the ratio between the fluorescence area values and the DAPI area values results in cell quantitation on a percentage basis.\nMaterials\nMacro for cell quantitation (Supporting Information Macro S1)\n1. Install the Fiji software including the Biovoxxel toolbox (Brocher, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-bib-0002], 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-bib-0003]).",
    "2. Because the macro is provided as a .docx file, it needs to be converted to a .ijm file, which can be processed by Fiji. Open Fiji, then open the macro editing window by clicking on the tab “Plugins” in the task bar. Next, choose the tab “New” from the drop-down menu, and finally the tab “Macro.” Copy the text from the .docx file into the macro editing window. Click on the tab “Language,”select “IJ1 Macro,” and save the macro.\n3. For automated cell counting, it is necessary to find the best threshold for each staining. Drag and drop the converted macro into the Fiji taskbar to open it in editing mode. Adjust the percentage for the threshold of your staining (line 91 of the macro). Start, for example, with a threshold of 95. The macro will hereby take only the brightest 5% of the signal into account. Run the macro and select a destination folder in which to save the results.",
    "4. Make sure that the threshold suits the staining as exactly as possible by taking a close look at the resulting pictures. In the resulting pictures, the microscope image is overlaid with the mask that was created from the DAPI signal (cells/areas outlined in yellow; Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0006]). Green lines indicate the signals that were counted as the brightest 5% of the signal in step 3. If the threshold is too low, many signals will not be counted (and therefore many fluorescent areas will not be encircled by green lines). If the threshold is too high, too much background will be counted as signal (negative areas will be encircled by green lines). Testing several different thresholds for each staining will help to find the perfect fit. It is also important to consider testing thresholds for all different time points of each staining of the experiment.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fea7c542-e04a-4e40-915a-9994539a49da/cpsc120-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nExample of an analysis using the macro for cell counting. Left: picture of the DAPI signal (blue); middle: proliferating cells were stained with an anti-KI67 antibody (red); right: image of the red KI67 signal overlaid with the mask which was created using the DAPI signal (yellow lines). Green lines indicate the areas that are counted as actual KI67 positive signal. Thresholds used here: particle size threshold, 500 pixels to infinity; red signal threshold, brightest 5%.",
    "5. To adjust the pixel range for the particle size (defining the size of stained areas to be taken into account), proceed as described for the fluorescence signal threshold in step 3 (line 163 of the macro; here: 500 to infinity; Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.120#cpsc120-fig-0007]). This step helps to discriminate between background, staining artifacts, and the actual fluorescence signal. Try different particle-size thresholds to find the one that fits for your analyses. If needed, adjust particle-size threshold for all channels separately.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b1f41e66-4757-4786-a54a-090bf46d32d1/cpsc120-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nExample of different particle size thresholds. Image of the red KI67 signal. Green lines indicate the areas which are counted as actual KI67 positive signal. Left: particle size threshold, 20 pixels to infinity; right: particle size threshold, 500 pixels to infinity. Note that in the left image, there are too many small particles counted as signal (white arrows).\n6. Before running the macro, create a folder for the results.\n7. Run the macro with the adjusted thresholds for all pictures to be analyzed and select the destination folder.\n8. A summary of the analyses will be saved as a text file in the results folder. Copy the data to Excel or any statistics program of choice.\n9. One approach to calculating the percentage of immunofluorescence-positive cells among all nucleated cells is to use the area values of the DAPI signal and the area values of the fluorescent signal for calculation. In order to do this, the mean value of the DAPI signal of all 36 pictures is calculated. This value represents the average number of nucleated cells or the average area of nucleated cells.\n10. Calculate the mean value of the fluroescent signal for each set of the four images per organoid. This will result in nine values (three organoids, three differentiations).",
    "11. To calculate the percentage of cells positive for the fluorescent signal, each of the nine mean values for the fluorescent signal (calculated in step 10) is divided by the mean DAPI value (calculated in step 9) and the result is multiplied by 100. This set of nine percentage values can be used for statistics.\n12. For quantitation of cells grown on cell culture slides, it would also be possible to directly use the number of counted fluorescence signals, which are listed in the results table (as absolute number of stained cells). In this case, cells need to be very evenly distributed in a single layer and should not be too close together. It is also necessary to make sure that there is only one fluorescent signal per nucleated cell (to be checked when adjusting the thresholds)."
