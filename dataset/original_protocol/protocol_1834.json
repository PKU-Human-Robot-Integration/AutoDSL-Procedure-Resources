    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample preparation – seeding cells\nTiming: ∼12–24 h\nThis part of the protocol addresses cell seeding, from grid preparation until the cells are ready for staining and plunge-freezing.\nGlow discharge EM grids:\nNote: While working with cells, use Au mesh grids.\nPlace a glass slide inside a petri dish (100 mm round dish).\nWith fine tweezers, gently place the desired number of grids, carbon layer facing up, on the edge of the glass slide so that ¼ of the grid is not touching the slide.\nPlace the petri dish with the grids inside a glow discharge instrument; remove the cover of the dish.\nUse plasma cleaning to make the grid’s surface hydrophilic: with air (15 sccm), radio frequency (RF) power 18W, duration 2min, pulse ratio 50/255.\nTake the dish out of the plasma cleaner and transfer it to a biosafety cabinet using proper aseptic techniques for working in a class II biosafety cabinet.\nPrepare the dish for seeding:\nNote: From this moment on, all the steps are performed in a biosafety cabinet.\nInside the biosafety cabinet, prepare 2 glass-bottomed 35 mm imaging dishes. The volumes used in this protocol were optimized for the 14 mm glass-bottom dishes.\nPlace 350 μL of GM inside each glass-bottomed well (only inside the well).\nGently transfer up to 4 grids to each dish, carbon layer facing up. The grids should sink to the bottom. If not, gently poke the grid edge with a 10 μL tip until they break the surface tension and sink.\nOptional: Alternately, carefully insert the grids on the edge using fine tweezers. This will require a better handling on the grids and will likely break less of the carbon film.",
    "Check the integrity of the holey carbon layer. Do not use grids in which more than ∼75% of the grid squares have torn carbon.\nKeep at 37°C, 5% CO2 until seeding.\nNote: there is probably no upper limit for how long grids can be kept under these conditions.\nOptional: For easier handling, put the 35 mm dishes inside a 100 mm plastic petri dish.\nSeeding cells:\nNote: All the solutions used in the following part are pre-warmed to 37°C.\nWash the cells twice with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) without calcium or magnesium.\nAdd 2 mL of trypsin solution to the cells and incubate for 5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nCheck under the microscope that the cells detach; they will be round and move upon the gentle shaking of the dish. If most of the cells are still attached, incubate for an additional minute. If the cells do not detach, consider opening a new batch of trypsin.\nAdd 8 mL of growth medium (GM) to the dish, tilt it to one side and wash it several times with the same solution to aspirate as many cells as possible. Transfer the cells to a 15 mL conical tube.\nSpin at 180×g for 5 min at room temperature.\nNote: In this protocol, room temperature is within the range of 21°C–25°C, and we refer to this range throughout the protocol.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1.5–2 mL of GM.\nRemove 200 μL of GM from each of the dishes prepared in step 2. e. and add 3x104 cells in 200 μL of GM only to the glass-bottomed area.\nNote: The number of cells depends on the type of cell and grid used. The numbers here are optimized for C2C12 on a 200 mesh Au, Quantifoil R3.5/1 grid.",
    "Shake the dish gently to spread the cells evenly on the glass bottom.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2–4 h.\nCheck under the microscope that the cells have attached to the grids before gently adding 2 mL of growth media to each dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nPause point: Incubate the cells for an additional 8–18 h at 37°C, 5% CO2 before proceeding.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1427-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. C2C12 cells on EM grids. Cells after 8–18 h of incubation\n(A) When the cell concentration is too high, many cells are placed in every grid square. An overcrowded grid compromises the targeting of specific cells later on in the workflow.\n(B) An optimal cell concentration is one that gives a good compromise between the number of cells and the ability to target a specific cell easily. Scale: 200 μm\nSample preparation – staining\nTiming: 30–45 min\nTo preserve the staining in the frozen cells, stain the sample right before the plunge-freezing. Although we describe staining only with BODIPY 493/503, additional staining, such as Hoechst or MitoTracker, can be applied simultaneously (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Generally, every chemical dye can be used if it does not interfere with the other dyes. Skip the staining steps if the cells are genetically expressing all the desired fluorescent markers.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1427-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Plunge-frozen grid under cryo-FM",
    "An EM grid of C2C12 cells stained with BODIPY493/503, to label lipid droplets (green), and MitoTracker DeepRed, to label mitochondria (red). Potential cells for cryo-FIB-SEM image acquisition are cells that are positioned close to the middle of the grid square (black, dashed circles). During the sample preparation steps, part of the carbon layer on top of the grid tears (black asterisks) and ice particles attach to the sample (black arrow), which may block the cells below them. Both tears and large ice particles can help with sample re-orientation during the cryo-FIB-SEM session. Scale: 100 μm.\nWash cells 2–3 times with warm DPBS.\nIncubate the cells with a warm staining solution of 1μg/mL BODIPY 493/503 in DPBS for 20 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nNote: In our hands, we observed a decrease in signal intensity after a couple of hours. This is probably due to cellular processes. Therefore, it is important that plunge freezing will be done within an hour from BODIPY 493/503 wash to retain staining of lipid droplets.\nWash out the staining solution thrice with warm GM and transfer the cells to an incubator.\nNote: It is recommended to keep cells in optimal incubation conditions (37°C, 5% CO2.) and so, we recommend having an incubator in proximity to the plunger.\nSample preparation – plunge freezing and clipping\nTiming: 2 h\nPlunge freezing is a cryo-immobilization approach in which the sample is rapidly plunged into a liquid cooled to cryogenic temperature. The rapid freezing prevents ice crystal formation and is essential for the sample preservation (Dubochet et al., 1988[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Our workflow uses clipped grids for easier grid handling, which increases the robustness of the workflow, however, this is not a requirement and unclipped grids work as well.",
    "Note: The workflow presented here uses a Leica EM-GP plunger (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany); modifications may be required for other plungers. The following link has a short video tutorial demonstrating the plunge freezing process in Leica EM-GP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyu9IgqlgKg&ab_channel=LeicaMicrosystems[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyu9IgqlgKg&ab_channel=LeicaMicrosystems]. Always work in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines.\nCheck the integrity of the plunging tweezers, as bent tweezers might damage the grids upon plunging.\nTurn on the plunger and fill the humidity bath with deionized H2O.\nReplace the blotting paper in the plunger and set the plunger to the following parameters:\nHumidity: 90%.\nTemperature: 37°C.\n2.5 s back blotting.\nNote: The calibration of the plunger changes between different instruments of the same type. Therefore, in the beginning of each session we perform a mock test with a wet grid to determine the blot arm position parameter. Check that the blot arm touches the grid pushing it slightly forward. A wet blotting mark appears on the blotting paper after the blotting.\nNote: The blotting time is calibrated according to the cell density and the grids used in Scher et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]. If using other cell types or grids, the protocol may need to be adjusted. Different cells may also require a different level of humidity and temperature.\nAutomatic plunging: on. This mode immediately plunges the grid after blotting.\nCool the system by pouring dry liquid N2 into the reservoir. When the vigorous bubbling stops, fill the rest of the reservoir and the grid box place.\nPlace a grid box in the designated place next to the ethane cup in the plunger.\nFill the liquid ethane cup to its brim with ethane.\nNote: To prevent waste of gaseous ethane, stop filling ethane if the temperature indicator rises above -160°C, and continue once the temperature returns to -178°C.",
    "Pick one grid using the plunger’s tweezers. When the tweezers are mounted, the cells should face away from the blotting paper.\nMove the tweezers to the loading position, press blot and check that a blotting mark remains on the blotting paper (problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nPress ‘transfer’ and gently detach the tweezers with one hand while holding the lower part of the tweezers with the other to keep the grid from hitting the cup.\nNote: To reduce the contamination hazard from breathing, wear a face shield while handling the frozen samples.\nRapidly transfer the grid to the box.\nOnce all the grids are plunged, store the box in liquid N2 and dry the plunger by starting the plunger’s bake-out function.\nCritical: From this moment on, every tool that touches the frozen grids needs to be cooled to liquid N2 temperature before handling of the grids.\nNote: The grids can be clipped at a different time. However, we recommend clipping immediately after the plunge-freezing.\nOptional: Clipping. Briefly, clipping is done by fixing a c-shaped clip into a c-clip ring with an EM grid in it under liquid N2 and using a special clipping tool and station. To account for the short working distance (WD) of the cryo-objective in the cryo-FM, it is important that the cells face away from the c-clip while clipping. For a detailed clipping tutorial, go to the Unit 2 Sample Preparation lecture of the Cryo-EM Course by Caltech (course website: http://cryo-em-course.caltech.edu/[href=http://cryo-em-course.caltech.edu/]).\nPause point: Store the grids in a liquid N2 storage system until imaging.\nCryo-fluorescence microscopy\nTiming: 2–3 h per grid\nLeica cryo-CLEM FM transfer shuttle can accommodate clipped grids. For older cryo-CLEM models and workflow, including video demonstrations, see Schorb et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9].\nTurn on the operating computer and all the microscope’s components.",
    "Note: To prevent communication errors, wait until the computer finishes booting before turning the camera on.\nTo reduce thermal fluctuations, pre-cool the objective:\nLower the cryo-objective ¾ of its range.\nInsert the pump into the liquid N2 Dewar slowly. After the bubbling of liquid N2 relaxes, start cooling.\nAllow the system 45 min to stabilize.\nWhile the microscope is cooling:\nTurn on the LASX software and allow stage initialization.\nOpen Leica’s MatrixScreener HCSA (High Content Screening Automatization) software and load the CLEM module (Schorb et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nFill a dry Dewar with liquid N2 to cool the cryo-CLEM shuttle.\nBring the grid box from the liquid N2 storage.\nPut the sample holder on the sample holder loading station.\nIn the last 5–10 min of stabilization, while wearing a face shield, cool the shuttle and keep it covered.\nLoading the sample:\nTransfer the grid box to the designated place in the shuttle and mount one grid, with its cells facing up, to the sample holder.\nGrab the sample holder with the transfer rod, retract the rod, and move away the sample holder loading station.\nCover the shuttle and attach it to the microscope.\nRaise the objective slightly to avoid damage during the transfer.\nOpen the valves of the microscope and the shuttle, transfer the sample, retract the rod, close the valves, and detach the shuttle.\nLower the objective to its final position.\nNote: For a detailed tutorial of the cryoCLEM protocol, check Appendix A. of Schorb et al., in particular the Methods video S1 (Schorb et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nFind focus using the brightfield.",
    "To observe the grid’s condition, apply a spiral scan with brightfield and GFP. This step will allow you to determine the overall condition of the grid, including the quality of the ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). If the grid is badly bent or the ice is too thick, do not use this grid. Replace it with another grid and refer to problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1427-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

In (B), fluorescent signal is hazy (black asterisks), and cracks are apparent in the ice (black arrows). Scale: 100 μm.\nMapping the grid:\nDefine a region in the middle of the grid, excluding the grid squares close to the c-clip ring. The view of the cells close to the c-clip might be obscured once the sample is tilted in the FIB-SEM.\nAcquire maps in all relevant channels. The step size is 1–2 μm over a range of 50–100 μm.\nGo over the generated mosaic and mark cells of interest with an auto-focus point indicator.\nTo obtain a map for re-orientation in the FIB-SEM, save a snapshot of the mosaic with all the focus points.\nAcquire a single tile stack for every cell of interest using a step size of 0.15–0.25 μm over 10 μm.\nNote: Change the range according to your cell’s height.\nNote: While 0.15 μm step size is beyond the z resolution of the instrument, we wanted to have the option to apply deconvolution to the stacks.\nUnloading the sample:\nCool the shuttle and attach it to the microscope’s stage.\nRaise the objective slightly to avoid damage during transfer.",
    "Open the valves of the microscope and the shuttle, grab the sample, retract the rod, close the valves, and detach the shuttle.\nStore the grid in its box.\nIf another grid is to be imaged, repeat steps 21–26 Otherwise, proceed to next step.\nOptional: Bake out:\nRaise the objective to the maximal height.\nHeat the microscope stage from the pump controller.\nTurn off all the components but the pump.\nAfter the temperature reaches 60°C and the stage is dry, turn off the pump and take it out of the liquid N2.\nPause point: The grids are stored until FIB-SEM imaging.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1: Loading clipped grids to the sample holder, related to step 29\nCryo-FIB-SEM\nTiming: 1–3 days\nOur Crossbeam 550 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) cryo-FIB-SEM workflow uses a sample transfer system by Leica (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), which includes a cryo-stage, Vacuum Cryo-Transfer shuttle (VCT), and a modified Vacuum Cryo-Manipulation system (VCM). The modification of EM-VCM was made to reduce ice contamination to the sample while exposed during mounting. The instrument loading chamber was enclosed in a thick nylon sheet to form an improvised glove box around it. To dry the air inside the enclosed space, dry gaseous N2 flows into the chamber at ∼1.5 psi (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B–4D, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). The steps related to the modified version of the VCM will be marked as optional.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1427-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Modified cryo-sample holder and vacuum cryo-manipulation (VCM) setups\n(A) A cryo-holder designed based on Leica’s sample holder, shown from three different angles. The stage holder has a pre-tilt of 25° and a copper lid to protect the sample during transfer. In the right image, a clipped grid is placed in the left slot.",
    "(B) A modified version of a Leica EM-VCM. The instrument is sealed with two clear plastic sheets, with a two-layered plastic tarp located between them. The lower layer of the tarp has holes for the entrance of hands (yellow circles).\n(C) Top view of the cryo-manipulation chamber. To keep a dry environment with as little vapor contamination as possible, dry N2 is inserted into the chamber (∼1.5 psi). An additional Cu tube is installed in the transfer inlet gate as a cryo-shield over a gap between the inlet gate and the VCM cold bath cage.\n(D) A demonstration of the work inside the VCM through the glove box. The upper layer of the tarp rests on the forearms of the user, ensuring a closed environment. Throughout the work process, a constant flow of dry N2 and a low-humidity environment (< 3%H2O) is maintained.\nOptional: We recommend performing a mock experiment with the instrumentation before putting a sample in the cryo-FIB. This step will ensure that minimal problems are encountered during the actual experiment.\nMicroscope preparation:\nInstall the cryo-stage in the chamber and pump down the system. We recommend doing this a night before the session so the system will have time to stabilize.\nInitialize the stage and move it to the cryo-transfer position.\nCool down the microscope with liquid N2; the working temperature should be lower than -140°C.\nNote: Start cooling the microscope once the vacuum is lower than 5×10−6 mbar.\nLoading sample:\nPlace a cryo-sample holder inside the VCM (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nTurn on Leica’s VCM.\nOptional: To work in a drier environment, we recommend warming the VCM chamber to 50°C–70°C for one hour, and to purge the enclosed space with dry N2 for 5–10 min before cooling it down.\nFill the reservoir with dry liquid N2.",
    "Start pumping liquid N2 to the chamber using the ‘low fill’ mode.\nPump a VCT and keep it pumped in standby. We pump the VCT while it is connected to a BAF060 (Bal-Tec, Liechtenstein) instrument, but it can be connected to any other VCT shuttle compatible port.\nWhen the VCM chamber is ready, place the grid box inside the chamber.\nOpen the box and transfer grids onto the sample holder, cells facing up.\nNote: To increase the success rate, we recommend loading two grids at once, in case one sample was damaged or the regions of interest are not easy to relocate.\nCover the sample holder with its lid to prevent sample contamination.\nCool the pumped VCT and attach it to the VCM.\nGrab the sample holder with the VCT rod and rapidly retract it to the VCT chamber.\nDetach the VCT and attach it to the Crossbeam.\nOptional: To reduce unwanted charging effects and improve the image quality, coat the sample surface with a 5–10 nm conductive layer of Pt or carbon prior to loading it into the FIB-SEM. We use a BAF060 instrument for this purpose.\nTransfer the sample holder to the chamber. Make sure it slides into the cryo-stage before retracting it a little to slightly turn it and remove the lid from the sample.\nDetach the VCT from the crossbeam.\nOptional: Close the dry N2 valve to stop the flow to the VCM.\nCryo-Serial Surface Imaging (SSI):\nTurn on both the FIB and the SEM columns.\nMove the sample to the SEM observation position and adjust the working distance (WD) to the FIB-SEM coincidence point (5 mm). Choose an object in the central area of the grid square for this adjustment.",
    "Take a wide field of view image of the entire grid (∼100X magnification) at high resolution (at least 3027x2304 pixels). This allows future digital zoom-in on regions of interest (ROIs).\nNote: The typical SEM settings for imaging of unstained cryo-cross sections are 1.6–2.3 kV, 25–40 pA. To avoid damaging the cross-section during scanning, keep the electron dose as low as possible, while considering signal-to-noise ratio. This is done by reducing beam current and pixel dwell time. The origin of contrast mechanism is in changes of secondary electrons (SE) yield, which are influenced by local surface potential (Grabenbauer et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Vidavsky et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Fine alternations in accelerating voltage need to be made to optimize the visualization, and change from sample to sample, therefore a range is given.\nUpload an FM map on a support computer and align it to the same orientation of the SEM map by flipping / rotation, using an image-processing editor (we used Fiji standard image transform functions (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])). Every landmark can aid in retracing an ROI: central mark, finder grid labeling, broken grid squares etc.\nNavigate the stage to ROIs, inspect them with a higher magnification of the SEM.\nOptional: Upload the transformed FM image to the ‘Image Navigation’ folder of the SmartSEM platform. Three-point registration will allow you to navigate the stage by clicking on the FM map positions.\nAdjust the height of the stage to the WD of the coincidence point for each ROI.\nRun SmartFIB software to operate the FIB.",
    "Inspect the ROI with the FIB. The ion beam is destructive to the specimen; therefore, it is recommended to use low ion beam currents for imaging. Typical parameters for imaging are 30 kV, 10–50 pA. Adjust the stage tilt to make the ROI clearly visible at the FIB field-of-view. Correct the WD if needed.\nNote: There are two possible setups for SSI: Normal-to-FIB and Low Angle. The Normal-to-FIB orientation positions the FIB perpendicular to the surface and minimizes the ion beam damage on the surface. However, when used on plunge-frozen cells on grids, this limits the exposed area on the cross-section. The Low Angle orientation has a smaller tilt angle and is usually used for lamella preparation. It exposes a larger area on the cross-section at the expense of the beam causing greater damage to the edges of the cross-section. We prefer to work as close as possible to the Normal-to-FIB orientation.\nPerform Pt-organometallic layer deposition to protect the sample surface from damage during milling:\nNote: The deposition in this protocol is neither electron beam nor ion beam induced. The precursor condensates on the colder surface of the specimen.\nMake sure that the Pt precursor is at room temperature.\nIncrease the WD to 7–8 mm.\nOpen and close the nozzle of the gas-injection system (GIS) for 3 cycles of 30 s each.\nNote: We use a multi-port GIS, but the steps are similar with a uni-port GIS.\nMove back to the working position and perform a milling test.\nCritical: Adjusting the FIB-SEM settings for milling and imaging are performed on another, unimportant, cell.",
    "Adjust the ion dose factor and dwell time to suit the sample’s particular properties. For the mammalian cells used in our study, we used an ion dose of (160–200 mC/cm2). The typical milling current range is 50–300 pA for a 10–30 nm slice thickness.\nNote: The dose factor, milling current, and slice thickness change the milling duration and affect the acquisition duration. To cover large volumes in several hours, we suggest increasing the slice’s thickness according to the object of interest’s dimensions and milling currents, when possible.\nCut a cross-section with a reasonable exposed area, showing at least 2 μm of the cell in height for SEM imaging adjustment. It is important to have some features on the cross-section to focus on, even milling artifacts can help at first, before image adjustment on a cellular object.\nOptimize the SEM parameters to obtain an acceptable image quality. Our acquisition parameters were as follows: acceleration voltage 1.6 kV, current 40 pA, pixel dwell time 12–22 μs, pixel size 10 nm, line average N=140. Detection: InLens SE and external SE2 were mixed at a ratio of 0.6–0.7 to reduce charging artifacts and optimize the signal to noise ratio (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nNote: To prevent electron beam damage, we keep the scan speed as fast as possible while the image quality is not greatly compromised. This, in turn, helps shorten the session’s overall duration. SEM imaging parameters may vary for different cells.\nCritical: Always work with the tilt correction feature on −36° when imaging a cross-section. The FIB and SEM alignment always sets a cross-section at a 36° angle to the SEM.",
    "Optional: Some samples may require back-scattered electron (BSE) detection in addition to SE detection. Atomic number-based contrast may add information which is not available with SE detection. This is the reason why heavy metal staining in room temperature FIB-SEM imaging generates contrast from a smooth cross-section. Despite the fact no heavy metals are introduced in cryo-FIB-SEM imaging, BSE detection is helpful when there are inherent heavy atoms in the samples, such as in biominerals. In such cases, we recommend using the dual channel feature in SmartSEM and collecting images using the energy-selective back scatter (EsB) detector in parallel.\nOptional: Setting the dynamic focus and scan rotation: In some cases, the focal point in different heights along a cross-section might be slightly different. To adjust the focal point using dynamic focus, first adjust the focus in the middle of the field of view. Then, use ‘reduced scanning area’ in the upper right part of the image and change the dynamic focus value to obtain a focused image. Check if the image is in focus on the bottom left part as well and readjust iteratively. Use the scan rotation feature to align the base of the cell with the x-axis.\nMove to the desired ROI and take a FIB image with a low current (20–50 pA).\nOn the FIB image: Place a milling pattern on the ROI. Select or create a recipe for serial sectioning with the adjusted milling parameters.\nCreate a folder for data collection, link the path to the recipe.\nStart the serial milling. If necessary, correct the SEM image quality on the exposed section’s face.\nAdjust a reduced scanning area to minimize the scanning time per frame.",
    "Follow the SSI process for the first 1–2 h and, if the session is stable, continue for long-term acquisition. This time is required for the system to reach a steady state, balancing milling and imaging iterations. If the cross-section drifts, refer to Problems 2–3.\nNote: Other instruments may require shorter or longer stabilization times.\nLong-term acquisition requires an automatic liquid N2 supply for the periodic refilling of the cryo-FIB-SEM Dewar, which normally needs to be refilled every 2 h. We use Norhof #905 (NORHOF LN2 MICRODOSING SYSTEM, The Netherlands) with a volume of 50 liters in the one-sensor controllable mode. The microdoser pumps liquid N2 into the microscope’s Dewar once every two hours, until it reaches the sensor’s level. The 50-liter container can supply liquid N2 for 2–3 days of continual work (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1427-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Liquid nitrogen refilling for long unsupervised acquisition.\n(A) For long acquisitions, the microscope Dewar is connected to a microdosing system that refills liquid N2 every two hours.\n(B) Close-up of the connection between the microdosing Dewar and the microscope Dewar. The N2 is replenished every two hours and the filling stops once the level of liquid reaches the sensor.\nPause point: After the data collection is completed, transfer the data to a third-party computer for further processing. For detailed image processing pipelines, see Spehner et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]. Take out the grids, passing through the VCM if they are to be kept, and store until future use.\n3D correlation: general housekeeping\nTiming: 0.5–3 h\nFor this protocol, we have uploaded a dataset for correlation (DOI: https://doi.org/10.34933/wis.000399[href=https://doi.org/10.34933/wis.000399]); the details of the dataset are presented in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1427_4.csv\nIdentify the data and metadata required.",
    "Note: Because the images are collected at different time points and on different imaging modalities, it is convenient to have all the files in one directory, which allows one to easily start the different registration steps.\n3D correlation of datasets\nTiming: 0.5–2 h\nCorrelating the binned FIB-SEM dataset and the BODIPY signal involves two main steps. The first is optional automatic registration, which consists of initializing the transformation without identifying the pairs of fiducials (steps 32–35). The second (step 36), which must be done in any case, consists of manual accurate registration by matching fiducials. If you decide to go directly to this manual step, open and check the metadata, as outlined in steps 32 and 33, before jumping to step 36.\nNote: The acquired cryo-FIB-SEM dataset was processed as described in Scher et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] prior to performing the correlation steps described below. Image processing varies based on the data acquired and, therefore, we do not cover this issue in this protocol.\nOpen the FM images, check the metadata, and extract LDs center:\nLaunch Icy.\nDrag and drop the fluorescence image stack containing the BODIPY signal. We use source_c1.tif in this step. Check the metadata in the ‘Sequence Properties’ panel (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). The stack pixel size should be 0.13 μm in the x and y and 0.15 μm in the z step. Edit the metadata by clicking on the edit button, if needed. Delete any previously added ROI (select all ROIs in the ‘ROI’ panel).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1427-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Metadata validation and LDs center extraction",
    "(A) Icy working environment showing the opened FM dataset source_c1. The most important step in the correlation procedure is to validate that the metadata in Icy is correct (red box), which involves checking the pixel size (red arrow) and editing, if needed. Without the correct pixel size, the transform is not computed properly.\n(B) To find the LDs centers, the Icy Spot Detector plugin is used. Simply search it using the search bar in the upper left corner of the Icy banner (shown in A.). In the ‘Detector’ panel, set the spot size to ‘Scale 2’ (red arrow) and check that the associated sensitivity is 10.\n(C) Go to the ‘Output’ panel to export the centers to the ROI list (red arrow). Then, press the ‘Start Detection’ button (red rectangle). D. The Spot Detector output is presented on the FM stack, which shows the segmented spots (green) and their centers (red circles’ centers).\nNote: While 0.15 μm step size is beyond the z resolution of the instrument, we wanted to have the option to apply deconvolution to the stacks.\nNote: In the source_c1.tif FM stack there are 19 LDs, one of which does not appear in the cryo-FIB-SEM dataset because it was out of the FIB-SEM’s field of view.\nSearch for the Spot Detector plugin in the search bar. Launch it while keeping all the default settings apart from the ‘Detector’ panel. Select ‘Detect bright spots over dark background,’ set the spot size to ‘Scale 2’ (by checking the associated box) and the associated sensitivity to 10 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). In the ‘Output’ panel, check the box ‘Export to ROI’ (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nClick ‘Start Detection’; spots should then be displayed as ROIs on source_c1.tif.",
    "Move the z cursor on the stack to parse z and check the segmentation (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D). Segmented ROIs are represented in green; the red circle indicates the xy position of their centroid, regardless of their z. The centroids disappear when closing the Spot Detector plugin. If you are not satisfied with the result, see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nClose the Spot Detector plugin and keep source_c1.tif opened.\nOpen the FIB-SEM stack and manually click LDs center of mass:\nDrag and drop the FIB-SEM data, here binned for memory and speed purposes. We use target_fibsem.tif in this step. Check the metadata in the ‘Sequence’ panel (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A); the stack dimensions should be 40 nm in x, y, and z. Edit the metadata by clicking on the edit button, if needed. Delete any previously added ROI (select all ROIs in the ‘ROI’ panel) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A and 7B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1427-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. LD picking in FIB-SEM and AutoFinder rough transformation\n(A) When loading the FIB-SEM stack onto Icy, it is critical to validate the entered pixel size dimensions in the ‘Sequence Properties’ panel (red box).\n(B) LDs can be manually picked using the ‘Region of Interest’ panel (left red box). Before you begin, make sure to delete any remaining ROIs in the ROI list of the FIB-SEM dataset (right red arrow), zoom in and mark the center of the LDs with a Point 3D object. Make sure to pick the center of the LD in z as well.\n(C) Upper part: the ‘ROI’ panel; we use Point 3D objects to pick the ROIs. Lower part: In case the centers of LDs were found using different software, such as Amira, import the coordinates from a .csv file, as described in step 33. c.",
    "(D) After picking the centers of the LDs, the first transformation is done with AutoFinder. The dimensions of both the source (upper red box, FM stack) and the target (lower red box, FIB-SEM stack) need to be checked again; the rest of the parameters are adjusted according to step 34. Press the ‘Play’ button (bottom left red box) to start the transformation.\n(E) The result is a transformed (rigidly) FM stack that has the same dimensions and orientation as the FIB-SEM data.\nUse the mouse or the ‘Sequence’ panel to navigate in the FIB-SEM data and identify the center of LDs (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nSelect ‘Point 3D’ from among the ‘type of ROI’ options in the ‘Region of Interest’ panel. Click on the approximated center of each LD parsing the z (If you click and no ROI points are appearing, see problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]). The provided cryo-FIB-SEM dataset should include 18 LDs but selecting only 15 could be sufficient.\nOptional: Alternatively, if you have identified the LDs in another software, such as Amira, you can use ImportRoiPointsFromFile. When importing EM ROIs from Excel:\nOpen the .xls file in Excel and remove the first column and first row. Keep only the columns with the x, y, and z coordinates. Save as a .csv file with comma separation.\nOpen ImportRoiPointsFromFile in Icy and load your ROIs to the EM data (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nLaunch AutoFinder and set the parameters as follows (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D):\nSource image: FM with spot-detected ROIs.\nTarget image: FIB-SEM with manually picked ROIs.\nTransform mode: Already in the same orientation.\nMax error: 10 μm.\nPercentage of target points to keep: 70%.",
    "The max error and percentage of target points to keep should allow to find a transformation in most cases. Additional explanation and how to change their values are described in problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nPress the ‘Play’ button to initiate the AutoFinder registration (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E).\nNote: If the initialization provided by this method is not good enough, see problems 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nCompute the 3D image registrations:\nSave the transformed source and give it an explicit name. It is advised to use the SaveAsTiffFast plugin for Icy. You can now close the source_c1.tif stack.\nNote: The transformed source image now has the same metadata as the FIB-SEM dataset.\nCritical: For each image opened in Icy, check that the metadata, such as pixel size and image dimensions, are correct. The metadata are shown in the right bar in Icy; edit it if needed. eC-CLEM will not be able to compute the transformation correctly if these details are incorrect.\nNote: If the metadata are incorrectly changed in Icy, this can be fixed by deleting the new xml metadata file that was created in the same folder as the image; this should reset the metadata to the original values.\nChoose the Affine transformation model and the Isotropic noise model.\nAdd fiducial markers to each of the images, dragging the corresponding point to the same place in the other image as it appears. Rotate the field of view of an image if it helps with finding the same area in both images.\nOptional: To make it easier to look at the same field of view in both datasets, pick the same numbered lock icon in the top left panel of both stacks. ‘Lock 3’ keeps the z dimension independent between the datasets, which is convenient for adding fiducial markers.",
    "Optional: z-alignment may be more easily done by observing the orthogonal view of the image stack. In Icy, click on the drop-down arrow in the top left corner of the image and change it from ‘2D’ to ‘OrthoViewer.’ This may help place the points more accurately in the center of the point spread function of each fluorescent point.\nNote: You can zoom in and out using the mouse scroll wheel. The image will zoom to the location of the mouse pointer on the image.\nCritical: When finding locations for fiducial markers, rotate the image using the right mouse button only, as this will not alter the image properties. The images might be flipped with respect to each other. Do not use Icy’s ‘Flip’ tool (or any other image-transformation tool that is not a part of eC-CLEM), as such changes are not tracked by eC-CLEM, which would result in an incorrect final transformation schema. Instead, place 2–3 points and ask eC-CLEM to compute the transform and it will flip the image during the transformation, after which you can easily place more points and re-compute the transform.\nCritical: When picking points in 3D registration in eC-CLEM, make sure to first scroll to the correct slice in both stacks before placing a marker point. The program adds the second marker in the other stack to whichever z slice is displayed, and this cannot be changed.\nClick on ‘update transform’ after placing 3–10 points. The transformation files will be automatically saved in the same folder as the source images.\nNote: Three files are saved per computation. The file required for recomputing the 3D transformation is a .xml file with the suffix transformation_schema.\nAdd more points if required and re-compute the transform.",
    "Once you are pleased with the transform, and after result evaluation (see the following section), the same transform can be applied to any additional FM channel acquired for the same dataset by uploading the channel and transforming it with the transformation_schema file.\nOptional: To avoid a cropping effect and to limit the interpolation of your data, combine the automatic registration and the step 36 registration as a cascaded transform as described in Vyas et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], by using the EcClemCascadeTransform plugin:\nClick ‘Add’ and select the transformation_schema .xml file created by AutoFinder.\nClick ‘Add’ and select the transformation_schema .xml file created by the 3D registration.\nClick ‘Choose File Name’ and give an explicit name to your transformation schema, such as original_cryoFM_to_cryoFIBSEM_schema.\nPress ‘Play’. To use this file, open the original FM data, launch the ApplyTransformation plugin, select the .xml file created in step c., and press ‘Run’. For additional information on cascaded transform, check eC-CLEM documentation and video tutorials over the GitHub page: https://github.com/anrcrocoval/ec-clem/[href=https://github.com/anrcrocoval/ec-clem/].\n3D correlation: evaluation of results\nThe accuracy of the co-registration can be evaluated using eC-CLEM. Two types of error calculations are available: (1) an error map showing the general distribution of the error in the whole image; (2) an error for each of the placed fiducial markers.\nGenerate an error map in eC-CLEM:\nAfter computing a transform, click ‘Compute the whole predicted error map’.\nThe error map can be scaled by adjusting the histogram.\nThe appearance of the scale bar or color bar can be toggled under the ‘layer’ panel in the right bar shown in Icy.\nThe maximum and minimum values on the color bar show the values of the maximum and minimum error.",
    "Install the histogram plugin in Icy (search for ‘histogram’ in Icy) to plot the error map distribution. The width of the plot on the x-axis corresponds to the registration error and the y-axis portrays the number of points with each error value.\nMeasure the error between points used as landmarks by clicking on ‘show measured error.’\nZoom in to the fiducial points to see red lines corresponding to the error.\nUse the ‘ruler helper’ tool in icy to measure the length of the red line, to obtain the error magnitude.\n‘Display 3D ellipse,’ which represents the 95% likelihood of matching, gives a measurement of the correlation accuracy."
