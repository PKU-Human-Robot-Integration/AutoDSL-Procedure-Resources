    "1. Decellularization of the BioVaSc\nRinse the vascular system of the porcine jejunal segment via cannulated arterial access and the intestinal lumen with PBS-. Repeat until it is completely clean.\nPrepare a 200 mm diameter glass tank with 4 adapters and connect them via silicon tubes to the peristaltic pump (Ismatec). The pressure controlling unit can be monitored via a pressure sensor that is connected to a sterile disposable dome (see Figure 1).\nFill reservoir bottles with decellularization (DZ) solution and check the tubing system for possible air bubbles.\nConnect the intestinal lumen with cable ties to the glass connectors for luminal flow. Pump 500 ml DZ solution into the red arterial access (Figure 1B) of the vascular system. Interrupt the pumping process every 15 min shortly to manually press out the entire intestinal lumen.\nDuring the decellularization process, the pressure of the buffer solution should be between 80 - 100 mm Hg, modeled after the natural blood pressure.\nWash the BioVaSc with PBS- until it is free of cell remnants (\"completely white\").\nFill the BioVaSc completely with DZ solution and incubate it submerge in DZ solution over night at 4 °C on rocking shaker.\nRepeat step 1.6.\nPlace the BioVaSc in DNase solution and incubate over night at 4 °C on rocking shaker.\nRemove DNase solution and rinse with washing buffer.\nγ-sterilization with 25 kGy\n2. The Different Cell Types\n2.1 Isolation of primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (mvECs) and fibroblasts\nCut skin biopsy (preferably preputium) into strips of 2 - 3 mm width with scalpel and rinse them 3x with PBS- solution.\nCover the tissue with Dispase solution and incubate it for 16 - 18 hr at 4 °C.\nSeparate epidermis from dermis with 2 tweezers and transfer both separately into petri dishes filled with PBS+.",
    "Rinse dermis strips 1x with Versene.\nAdd 10 ml Trypsin/EDTA solution to the dermis strips and incubate it in the incubator for 40 min.\nStop the enzyme reaction immediately with 1% FCS.\nTransfer skin strips to a petri dish filled with VascuLife and scratch out each strip with the scalpel 8x each side, adding a little pressure.\nTransfer the produced cell suspension via a cell strainer to a centrifuge tube and rinse cell strainer 3x with VascuLife.\nCentrifuge the tube at 1,200 x g for 5 min and resuspend the cell pellet with VascuLife.\nTo isolate the fibroblasts, chop dermis strips into little pieces using the scalpel.\nAdd 10 ml of collagenase solution to dermis pieces.\nIncubate it for 45 min in the incubator, then centrifuge it and carefully remove supernatant.\nWash pellet 1x with DMEM + 10% FCS + % PenStrep, centrifuge it and carefully remove supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in culture medium and transfer it to a T75 culture flask to allow cells to grow out of the tissue.\n2.2 Tumor Cell Line S462\nThe tumor cell line S462 (kindly provided by Dr. Nikola Holtkamp, Charité University Medicine Berlin) was generated from a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor of a female patient with the hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 9. S462 are cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Medium has to be changed every 2 - 3 days. Once a week the cells have to be split.\n3. Tumor Test System: Static Culture Conditions Compared with Dynamic Culture In Bioreactor Systems\nCut the tubular SIS-Muc open on one side and fix it between two metal rings (cell crowns, 10 mm diameter, self constructed). Cover the SIS-Muc in cell culture medium overnight.",
    "Seed isolated cells in defined cell numbers (see below) on one or both sides of the SIS (mono- or co-culture set-up).\n\t\nSeed 8,000 cells/cm2 of primary mvECs in a total volume of 100 μl onto the basolateral surface of the SIS (former serosa). 3 hr later fill the well with medium to ensure a submersed culture.\nAllow endothelial cells to adhere for 3 days. Flip the static culture system by 180° and transfer it to a 12-well plate.\nSeed a mixture of primary dermal fibroblasts (8,000 cells/cm2) and tumor cells (15,000 cells/cm2) within a total volume of 500 μl on the apical surface of the SIS (the side of the former lumen).\nAllow cells to adhere for 3 hr and fill the well with medium (submersed culture, medium: 50% Vasculife + 50% DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS).\nThe tumor test system is cultured under static conditions at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in the incubator for additional 14 days. Change culture medium every 2 - 3 days.\nFor the dynamic culture, fix the SIS-Muc between two metal rings and seed primary mvECs as described in 3.2.1. After 3 days remove the SIS-Muc from the metal rings and insert the membrane into the flow reactor (see Figures 2C and 2D). Apply the primary dermal fibroblasts and tumor cells with a syringe and cannula onto the matrix in the bioreactor, and allow the cells to adhere for 3 hr before filling the bioreactor system with culture medium.\nOn the following day dynamic culture conditions with constant medium flow (3.8 ml/min, 37 °C, and 5% CO2) can be initiated. The dynamic culture is maintained for 14 days, culture medium is changed after 7 days.",
    "The dynamic test setup is cultured in a self-constructed incubator that provides media flow through a pump and the necessary temperature and CO2 content.\n4. Characterization Methods for Analysis\n4.1 Fixing and paraffin-embedding of the seeded collagenous matrix\nFor (immuno-) histological characterizations remove the culture medium and fix the tissue with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 hr.\nRemove 4% paraformaldehyde and transfer the SIS from the metal insert to a tissue embedding cassette. Water the tissue to remove remaining fixative and dehydrate for paraffin infiltration.\nBefore embedding in a paraffin block, cut the SIS in 2 - 3 slices and place them in a paraffin-filled metal base mold so that the cut surfaces face downwards. Add the tissue cassette on top of the mold as a backing.\nCut 5 μm slices and float them on a 40 °C water bath for straightening, then mount slides onto suitable glass slides. Uncoated slides are used for H&E stains, polylysine-coated slides for immunohistological staining to improve attachment. Let slices dry thoroughly.\nMelt paraffin, remove it with xylene and rehydrate slices for following staining.\n4.2 Staining\nThe rehydrated slices can be stained with Hematoxylin/Eosin as a standardized overview staining.\nFor immunhistological staining, the fixed and paraffin-infiltrated tissue slices must undergo an antigen retrieval to allow antibodies to recognize and bind to their specific epitopes. Therefore, deparaffinized and rehydrated slides are placed in a steam cooker with heated citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 min.\nTransfer slides to washing buffer (0.5 M TBS buffer + 0.5% Tween) and circle slices with a PAP pen to minimize the required volume for staining solutions.\nPlace the slide in a moisture chamber. To secure a specific horseradish peroxidase-mediated visualization of antigen-antibody-binding, the endogenous peroxidase must be saturated with 3% hydrogen peroxide.",
    "Primary antibody dilutions are applied to the slices, incubated for 1 hr at RT and carefully washed off with washing buffer.\nFor detection of specific antigen-antibody bindings the Ultra Vision Quanto Detection System HRP DAB (Thermo Scientific) is used according to the recommended protocol.\nNuclei are counterstained with Hematoxylin for 1 min.\nSlides are mounted with an aqueous medium, dried, and imaged using an inverse microscope."
