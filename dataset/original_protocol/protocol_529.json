    "**Design of sgRNA target sequence**\nSgRNA target sites were designed by seeking sequences corresponding to N20NGG on exon regions of the sense or antisense strand of the DNA by ZiFit Targeter program13. Then we BLAST \\(Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) these candidate target sequences against the P. xuthus genome to eliminate those with potential off-target sites using strict criteria, where the candidate editable site is defined only when the seed region \\(12 nucleotides \\(nt) to protospacer adjacent motif \\(PAM) NGG) is unique1. From candidate editable sites, we selected those with the first two bases of GG, GA or AG for sgRNA synthesis. \n**SgRNA preparation** \nSgRNA can be produced by plasmid-based or PCR-based strategies. We list the protocol of two methods here, but based on our experiences, we recommend PCR-based strategy. \nFor plasmid-based method, please go 1. \nFor PCR-based method, please go 3.\n1. _Construction of empty gRNA plasmid._\n  1) Order the double-strand oligonucleotides including sequences of T7 promoter \\(underlined with framed denoting the transcription start site), restriction endonuclease BsaI \\(Bold) and DraI \\(Bold and italic) sites, and guide RNA \\(underlined and italic) as following:\nTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAGAGACCGAGAGAGGGTCTCAGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGCTAGTCCGTTATCAACTTGAAAAAGTGGCACCGAGTCGGTGCTTTTAAA \n2) Ligate the above double-strand oligonucleotides into PMD18-T. \nddH2O                     3 μl            \nPMD18-T Simple vector       1 μl\nDouble-strand oligonucleotides  1 μl\nSolution I                   5 μl       \n                          10 μl\nIncubate at 16°C for overnight.\n3) Transformation and plate on Kanamycin \\(Kan) + plate \\(50 mg/ml). \n4) Confirm correct insertion of double-strand oligonucleotides by sequencing using M13-47 primer.\n5) Mini-prep PMD18-T7-gRNA plasmid using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit.  \n2. _Construction of sgRNA expression plasmid_\n  1) Order oligos \\(oligo1 and oligo2, produced by ZiFit Targeter program)\n2) Aneal and phosphorylate oligos\nddH2O                6.5 μl\nOligo1 \\(100 μM)          1 μl \nOligo2 \\(100 μM)          1 μl\n10X T4 Ligation Buffer     1 μl \nT4 PNK                0.5 μl               \n                       10 μl",

Adult and hand pair\n  Pupae were reared in plastic baskets at room temperature or under the conditions of 26 °C, 75% relative humidity and 18h/6h light/darkness. Emerged adults were crossed via hand-pairing<sup>14,15</sup>. \n2. Egg laying, collecting and preparing\n  Mated females were transferred into net room with host plants for oviposition. Eggs were collected from the host plant leafs following 15-60 min oviposition bouts, dipped into clear water and then aligned on the microscope slide mounted into a model designed by our lab using soft paintbrush, fixed by glue.\n**Microinjection and egg hatching**\n1. _Microinjection_\n  2 nl mixture of sgRNA\\(s) and Cas9-encoding mRNA with the different combination of final concentration was injected through the chorion into each egg under a stereoscopic microscope \\(Nikon SMZ800), using an TransferMan NK2 and FemtoJet microinjection system.\n2. _Hatching_\n  Injected eggs contained in the petri dishes were placed in an incubator at 25°C and 70% relative humidity. When embryos are close to hatch, host leaves \\(e.g a horticulturally rutaceous plant \\(Zanthxylum piperitum) are placed into the dishes for newly hatched larva feeding. \n**Breeding and Phenotyping**\n1. _Breeding_\n  The leaves with newly hatched larvae are carefully transferred into large petri dishes. All larva were fed on host leaf collectively or individually in glass containers. Container is cleaned and leaves of host plant are renewed every day. Pupae are transferred into plastic baskets to eclose.\n2. _Phenotyping_",
    "For developed but unhatched eggs, which are morphologically black, we dissect larvae from eggs and observe their morphological traits using stereoscopic microscope. Larvae of the newly hatched and the second instar were carefully checked using stereoscopic microscope and pictured using microscopic digital camera if there are morphological changes compared with wild type. From third instar larvae on, morphologic changes in different developmental stages are observed using stereoscopic microscope or by naked eyes. In the cases of the three genes, we mainly observe abdomen habitus for Abd-B; for ebony, we mainly pay attention to the color of larvae and adults; for frizzled, we mainly observe the cuticular structures.\n**Genotyping**\n1. _Sampling, genomic DNA extraction, and target loci amplification_\n  Sampling strategies are determined based on the anticipated phenotypes of target genes and the developmental situation of injected individuals. Genomic DNA extraction and PCR for unhatched larva dissected from developed eggs are carried out using Animal Tissue Direct PCR kit \\(FOREGENE, China) following manual instruction; genomic DNA of hatched larva, prepupa, pupa and adult are extracted using Gentra Puregene Blood Kit \\(Qiagen, Germany), and their target sites are amplified using exTaq polymerase. Amplified target region \\(300-800 bp) are purified with Qiagen PCR purification kit, and eluted in 30μl Nuclease-free water. \n2. _T7 endonuclease I mutation detection assays_\n  Purified or unpurified PCR products of target loci were for T7 endonuclease I \\(T7EI) mutation detection assays as previously described 16. It is noted that T7E1 might cause false positives if the target DNA sequences carry allelic polymorphism, AT-rich region, or sequence differences due to PCR errors.\n3. _Cloning and Sequencing_\n  T7EI positive and/or morphologically mutated individuals were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing 12 TA clones. \n**Validation of expression of disrupted gene**",

The differences in expression of Abd-B gene between mutants and wild type were compared by SPSS16.0 statistics software \\(SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) using Independent_Sample t Test.
