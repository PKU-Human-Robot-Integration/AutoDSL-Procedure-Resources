    "All procedures in this protocol followed the principles of animal welfare of the Ethics Review Committee of Shenzhen Second People's Hospital. Islet graft recipients and donors were 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice purchased from the Medical Animal Center of Guangdong Province. The procedure of the harvesting, isolation, culture, or administration of the harvested cells were carried out in aseptic conditions.\n1. Islet preparation\nPrepare a collagenase Type V working solution. Weigh collagenase Type V and dissolve with D-Hank's buffer to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, filter using a 0.22 μm syringe-driven filter unit and a 60 mL syringe and precool in ice. A volume of 5 mL for each donor recipient is required.\nEuthanize a 10-week-old C57BL/6 male mouse (23 ± 2 g) by cervical dislocation and spray the external part of the mouse with 75% ethanol for a few seconds. Meanwhile, fill a 5 mL syringe with collagenase solution and change the syringe needle with a bending blunt-pointed perfusion needle (32 G).\nPut the donor mouse in the supine position on an ice bag under the dissecting scope, cut a transverse opening using straight pointed ophthalmic scissors in the skin of the pubic area, and completely incise the skin towards the head. Then completely open the abdomen via a V-incision from the pubic region to the xiphoid process.\nExpose the gall bladder and the entire length of the common bile duct by repositioning the liver. Then clamp the duodenal opening of the common bile duct with a vascular clamp and cut a small opening in the gallbladder.\n\tNOTE: Optimal needle placement is important to prevent backflow into the liver and gallbladder.",
    "Cannulate the common bile duct from the gall bladder opening using the perfusion needle in step 1.2, then inject ~2 mL of collagenase solution into the pancreas. After that, separate the perfused pancreas from the intestines, stomach, and spleen using two pairs of noninvasive microtweezers, and put it into a 50 mL conical tube on ice.\n\tNOTE: Repeat the process for all donor mice. Three consecutively perfused pancreases (no more than 40 min apart) can be combined into a 50 mL conical tube prefilled with 3 mL of collagenase solution for each pancreas.\nAdd 100 μL DNase I (10 mg/mL) per pancreas into the 50 mL conical tubes, and digest the pancreases in a water bath at 37 °C by shaking the conical tubes for 3–5 min.\n\tNOTE: Shake the tubes vigorously 40x in 10 s intervals to disassociate the tissue prior to digestion in the water bath, and then moderately shake the tubes during digestion.\nAdd stop solution (2.5 mg/mL BSA-HBSS solution) up to a final volume of 50 mL to block the digestion, and pulse centrifuge the tubes to a speed of 750 x g at 4 °C and quickly stop.\nPour off the supernatant and wash the pellets 2x by gently resuspending in 15–25 mL of BSA-HBSS. Pulse centrifuge the tube with the same speed conditions as outlined in step 1.7 for 1 min.\nPour off the supernatant and pool the pellets of the three conical tubes into a 50 mL conical tube. Resuspend the pellets in a total volume of 10 mL of histopaque-1119. Mix homogeneously, and sequentially add 5 mL of histopaque-1077 and 5 mL of HBSS by pipetting slowly along the side of the tube.\nSpin the samples in the centrifuge at 750 x g at 4 °C for 10 min without brakes.",
    "Aspirate the islets from the HBSS/histopaque-1077 interface into a 50 mL conical tube using a disposable 5 mL Pasteur pipette, add BSA-HBSS to a final volume of 50 mL, and pulse centrifuge at 750 x g at 4 °C.\nPour off the supernatant and wash the islets using 30 mL of BSA-HBSS. Centrifuge for 1 min at 750 x g at 4 °C.\nResuspend the islets using 30 mL of culture medium (10% FBS-1%P/S-CMRL-1066) per tube and pour in a 10 cm diameter light-tight culture dish. Under a stereomicroscope, using 200 μL gel-loading pipet tips, handpick the islets from the solution based on their morphology (i.e., spheroidal, white). Put into an untreated cell culture dish with 10 mL of culture medium.\n\tNOTE: A second handpicking can be carried out if the purity of first-purified islets is not optimal after the first picking.\nCheck the purity of the handpicked islets by dithizone staining under a light microscope and detect the viability of islets by fluorescein diacetate (FDA)-propidium iodide (PI) staining under a fluorescent microscope.\nCulture the isolated islets in culture medium (as in step 1.13) in an incubator at 37 °C, 95% air-5% CO2 before transplantation.\n2. ISWAT islet transplantation\nInduce diabetes in the 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (22 ± 2 g) by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ). On day -4, fast the mice for ~4–6 h, then prepare a 2% STZ solution using 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.4). Weigh, resuspend in buffer, and inject the mice intraperitoneally at a dose of 180 mg/kg.\n\tNOTE: STZ solution needs to be freshly prepared before use and covered with aluminum foil due to its light sensitivity. It should be used immediately, because it will lose activity within 15–20 min.",
    "Puncture the caudal veins of the STZ-injected mice to collect some blood at around 10 AM of day -1 and day 0 and measure the non-fasting blood glucose level using a test strip and a basic blood glucose monitoring instrument. The mice will be used as islet transplantation recipients if the blood glucose levels of the 2 consecutive test days are both at least 20 mmol/L.\nOn day 0, weigh and mark all the recipient mice. Anesthetize each recipient by injecting 60 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium intraperitoneally.\n\tNOTE: Administer a toe pinch to check the depth of anesthesia. If the recipient mouse has no withdrawal reflex, the level of anesthesia is enough for surgery. If not, administer an additional 10 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium. The pentobarbital sodium used was diluted in sterile physiologic saline at the concentration of 2% (m/v).\nTake the hydrogel out from a -20 °C freezer and keep it on ice to allow thawing. The hydrogel is liquid at 4–10 °C and will solidify at a higher temperature.\nPick ~450–500 islet equivalents (IEQ) for each recipient into a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube under the stereomicroscope (as in step 1.13) with 200 µL of culture medium and keep on ice until ready for transplantation.\nSwab the left inguinal area of the recipient using 75% ethanol. Place it in the supine position and fix the four limbs using surgical tape. Shave off the hair around the surgical site with electrical clippers and swab the area with Iodophor.\nMake a vertical skin incision in this area using the ophthalmic scissors and noninvasive microtweezers, identify the inferior epigastric artery and vein in the ISWAT, and create a small pocket above the vessels.",
    "Spin the islets tube for 30 s at 200 x g and remove the supernatant as much as possible. Aspirate 20 µL of completely thawed hydrogel and load it into the tube with the islets. Resuspend the islets gently, avoiding bubbles.\nDeliver the entire islet-hydrogel mixture in the tube into the pocket (step 2.7) of the recipient with a 200 µL pipette tip.\n\tNOTE: This process requires two technicians, one for picking up the edges of the pocket using noninvasive microtweezers, and the other for delivering the islet mixture into the pocket.\nAdd 20 µL of cephalosporin (~5–10 mg) into the transplantation site after the islets-hydrogel mixture is completely solidified, then use a 5-0 surgical suture to close the muscle and skin with the continuous suture method.\n\tNOTE: The hydrogel needs about 3 min to solidify due to the body temperature.\nPlace the recipient into a clean cage and keep warm using a thermal pad. Keep monitoring until the recipient fully recovers and starts to move autonomously. Then administer 0.03 mg/ml Buprenorphine with sterile physiological saline intraperitoneally, according to 0.1 mg/Kg dose.\nRepeat steps 2.3–2.11 for each recipient mouse.\nMeasure the non-fasting blood glucose levels of the recipient mice (as in step 2.2) 3–4x a week for the first month, and 1x a week thereafter.\nAt the end of the follow-up (100 days after transplantation), under anesthesia (carried out as in step 2.3) excise the ISWAT bearing the graft from the recipients following the sterile steps described in step 2.6. Fix the tissue in formalin and paraformaldehyde according to the histological protocols for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunofluorescence of insulin and glucagon.\nAdd cephalosporin and close the incision of the recipients as in step 2.10, then prepare for recovery as in step 2.11.",
