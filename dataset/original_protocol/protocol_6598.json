    "The protocol of thawing Plasmodium knowlesi A1-H.1 parasite depends on the source of parasites and needs to be checked with the person that froze the sample. Parasites are maintained in a flask gassed with a mixture of 90% N2, 5% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 °C, monitored by microscopy using Giemsa-stained thin films, and parasitaemia maintained at between 0.5% and 10%. All procedures need to be carried out with sterile equipment, materials and reagents with aseptic techniques. Local safety policies must be followed for all work involving human infectious agents.Parasite multiplication assaySynchronize P. knowlesi parasites via purification with NycodenzTransfer 5 ml of 55% Nycodenz working solution to a 15 ml conical tube and warm up to room temperature (check Note 1).Centrifuge down a high parasitemia (4-10%) P. knowlesi 50 ml culture with 2% hematocrit at 900 x g for 4 min at high brake/acceleration at room temperature.Resuspend parasite pellet at 50% hematocrit in RPMI.Carefully lay 2 ml of this culture onto 5 ml Nycodenz in a 15 ml tube.Centrifuge at 900 x g for 12 min with low brake/acceleration (check Note 2).Transfer the brownish colored top layer schizonts to a new conical tube and wash with RPMI to remove Nycodenz (see Figure 2).Incubate schizonts in culture media with 1 μM Compound 2 for 2-3 h (check Note 3).Wash off Compound 2 with RPMI (centrifuge at 900 x g for 4 min at high brake/acceleration at room temperature) and transfer schizonts back to culture (with 2% hematocrit red blood cells). The number of harvested schizonts depends on the starting parasitemia and age of the parasites (check Note 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200903/20200903012645_5088.jpgFigure 2. Schizont enrichment with NycodenzIn the following cycle, when parasites are again reaching the schizont stage, set up the multiplication assay in a 96-well plate (see Figure 3 for the plate layout).",
    "Fill out all outer wells in the 96-well plate with 100 μl of RPMI or sterile water. This ensures inner wells are not affected by evaporation.Plate out 75 μl complete growth media alone (or with vehicle control) or with 2x concentration of drug or antibody to be tested. Plate out 75 µl of the parasite culture per well as indicated in the plate layout. The plate layout can be customized depending on the individual experiment (see Figure 1 for plate layout).Prepare a culture with young schizonts at around 1% parasitemia and 4% hematocrit.Purify synchronous schizonts with Nycodenz as described in Step A1.Resuspend parasite pellet with 1 pellet-volume complete media to 50% hematocrit.Prepare complete media with 4% red blood cells (e.g., 5 ml media + 200 μl red blood cells).Transfer 1% schizonts to media + 4% red blood cells (around 4-6 μl of 50% schizonts to 5 ml, depending on the parasitemia of enriched schizonts that is usually between 80 and 90%) and mix well.Confirm the parasitemia by counting at least 400 cells of a blood smear.Add 75 μl of the culture to each well that contains 75 μl media and mix by pipetting.Plate out 150 μl of uninfected red blood cells (2% hematocrit) as a control.Mix by pipetting up and down and transfer 50 μl of each well to a new 96-well plate. Carry out Step A3. if the parasites can be measured with FACS within the next 30 min or with Step A4. if parasites are fixed and measured up to 1 week later (check Notes 5, 6, 7).Incubate the 96-well plate with 100 μl parasite cultures for one growth cycle (24 h) under standard parasite culture conditions (37 °C, 3% O2 and 3% CO2 and 94% Nitrogen).",
    "After 24 h incubation, mix each well and transfer 50 μl of the remaining 100 μl culture to a new 96-well plate. This is plate 2 (final parasitemia). Continue with Step A3. if the parasites can be measured with FACS within the next 30 min or with Step A4. if parasites are fixed and measured up to 1 week later (check Notes 5, 6, 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200903/20200903012708_5271.jpgFigure 3. Example of the plate layoutPrepare samples for flow cytometry for live cell flow cytometryPrepare filtered PBS and a 1:5,000 dilution of SYBR Green I in PBS.Add 50 μl of SYBR Green I dilution to the 50 μl of parasite culture and incubate for exactly 30 min at room temperature.Dilute stained cultures 1:5 in filtered PBS by adding 40 μl of stained cells to 160 μl of PBS and run on a FACS machine.Prepare samples for fixed cell flow cytometryPrepare all buffers in filtered PBS [0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml ribonuclease A, 1:10,000 dilution of SYBR Green I)].Add 50 μl of fixative to 50 μl of parasite culture and incubate at 4 °C for at least 1 h or overnight.Centrifuge down plates for 4 min, at 4 °C and 763 x g in bench top centrifuge for plates with medium brake/acceleration settings.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 100 μl PBS and spin down again.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 100 μl of PBS with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Wash twice with 100 μl PBS.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 100 μl 0.5 mg/ml ribonuclease A in PBS and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.Wash with 100 μl PBS.",
    "Remove as much PBS as possible and resuspend pellet with 100 μl 1:10,000 SYBR Green in PBS and incubate for exactly 30 min at room temperature (always keep SYBR Green tube and stained cells protected from light and keep SYBR GREEN I incubation consistent for all samples).Resuspend cells again and dilute 1:5 in PBS (Transfer 40 μl to a new 96-well plate with 160 μl PBS. No need to wash off SYBR Green I).Keep plates at 4 °C and protected from light. Measure parasitemia by FACS on the same day.Record events by flow cytometryFor the Becton Dickenson LSR-II the following Voltages are used:FSC                                               170       logSSC                                               209       logGreen laser 530/30 488 F          360       logRecord 50,000-100,000 cells/treatment group.Export data to fsc file format.Analyze the flow cytometry dataUpload the fsc files to FlowJo, Flowing or a comparable flow cytometry software.Open Dot Plots for each well of the 96-well plate.Within the Dot Plot of the RBC only control, generate a gate for RBCs (R1) that excludes other blood cells or broken red cells. X-axis is FSC-A and y-axis is SSC-A (see Figure 2).Open a Histogram for R1 and generate a gate for parasites (H-2). X-axis is SYBR-Green signal 530/30 488F-A and y-axis is number of cells. Compare RBC only control with a parasite containing well to find the right areas on the x-axis where RBCs and parasites need to be separated (Figure 4). Use the same gates for all wells.Save data as xls file and open it with excel.Calculate ratios (H-2/R1*100) and subtract the ratio of RBC only control. Calculate the ratio of End (24 h incubation, plate 2) and Start (0 h incubation, plate 1) to determine the multiplication rate (Example in Figure 5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200903/20200903012816_5202.jpgFigure 4. Gating of flow cytometry data. Within the Dot Plot a region (R1, green) defines red blood cells.",
    "All cells within that region are analyzed within a Histogram. In the Histogram a region (H-2) is defined to separate parasites from uninfected red blood cells (RBCs). The ratio of Parasite/total RBCs ((H-2/R1)*100) is calculated to give the parasitemia.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200903/20200903012846_5914.jpgFigure 5. Calculation of Multiplication rates Parasite growth inhibition activity (GIA) assaySet up GIA assay in 96-well plate flat/half area tissue cluster culture platesPlates should include: Triplicate wells of each test IgG concentration Triplicate wells of positive control6 x wells with infected erythrocytes and media only (0% GIA control)6 x wells with uninfected erythrocytes at 2% hematocrit or iRBCs + 5 mM EDTA (100% GIA control / background)3 x wells with non-malarial human antibody as a negative control Plate out 20 μl of purified IgG (check Note 8) in 2x concentration in incomplete media to wells. Use serial 1:2 dilutions of immune serum or pre-immune serum of around eight final concentrations, depending on the EC50 value (for example 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312, 0.15 and 0.075 mg/ml). Set up each treatment in triplicate test wells. Enrich P. knowlesi parasites via Nycodenz purification (see Step A1) or by magnetic separation (Ribaut et al., 2008).Prepare 20 ml cell culture at 1.5 % parasitemia in 4% red blood cell suspension in 2 x warm complete media (e.g., 20 ml media + 800 μl red blood cells + 12 μl trophozoites (~1.2 x 109).Confirm parasitemia by counting of blood smear. Add 20 μl of culture with 4% hematocrit and 1.5% parasitemia trophozoites or only uninfected RBCs to the IgG plates using a multichannel pipette. Change tips for each set of triplicate samples. Incubate for one cycle (in P.",
    "knowlesi 26-27 h) in standard culture conditions, together with a tracking culture (5 ml cell culture + 5 ml media in culture flask) to check parasitemia and life cycle stage.Before harvest check parasitemia (~ 4%) and life cycle stage (trophozoites are ideal, young parasites don’t have adequate LDH levels) of tracking culture.GIA assay harvestAdd 100 μl of cold PBS to each well. Spin down plates at 1,300 x g for 4 min with maximum acceleration/break setting. Aspirate 100 μl of supernatant from all wells. Do not aspirate any RBCs. Tilting the plate away from the RBC pellet will help.Repeat the Steps a to conce. Freeze at -80 °C if the assay is not going to be performed immediately–but this is not necessary otherwise.Measure parasitemia with the lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) activity assayHave NBT solution in LDH buffer ready and warm to room temperature. If plates have been frozen, thaw them at room temperature for at least 30 min. Plates need to be uniformly warmed to room temperature. If the plates have not been frozen, it is important that RBCs are uniformly resuspended prior to assay e.g. shake plate on Titramax at max settings for 1 min and check if RBC pellets have fully disappeared (check Note 9).Prepare complete LDH substrate by adding 50 μl of 3-Acetylpyridine Adenine Dinucleotide (APAD) stock and 200 μl of Diaphorase stock to every 10 ml of NBT solution. After all reagents are combined, use prepared LDH substrate immediately. Start the timer and add 120 μl of complete LDH substrate to all wells. Avoid bubbles (fully depress the plunger of the multichannel pipette before picking up the first aliquot of substrate, pipette should draw up extra substrate and no air will be ejected. Pipette down at the edge of the wells).",
