    "The scheme of the procedure is provided in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191113/20191113231626_3463.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of the procedure of ELISA based protein ubiquitylation measurement. 1. Immobilize HBH tagged CFTR on NeutrAvidin coated 96-well plate. 2. The CFTR binding proteins (other proteins) are removed by adding the Denaturing buffer and washing with the Urea wash buffer. 3. Using an anti-Ub antibody (e.g., anti-Lys48 specific ubiquitin antibody), the ubiquitylation is detected. Refer to the procedure for a detailed description.Lysate preparation from BHK cells expressing Biotin-tagged CFTRPrepare confluent BHK cells (negative control) and BHK cells expressing Biotin-tagged target protein (e.g., HBH-∆F508-CFTR-3HA) on a 60 mm dish.Incubate with inhibitors (e.g., 10 μM MG-132) for 3 h at 37 °C to accumulate the ubiquitylation.Lyse cells with 1 ml of lysis buffer (Recipe 3) on ice.Centrifuge (14,000 x g) for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer 1 ml of supernatant to a fresh tube and place on ice for immediate assay or store at -80 °C for future usage.Biotin-tagged CFTR immobilization on NeutrAvidin coated 96-well plateWash the plate with the Wash buffer (400 μl/well) (Recipe 4).Block the plate with the Blocking buffer (100 μl/well) (Recipe 5) for 15-30 min on ice.Add the cell lysate to the plate according to Figure 2.Note: Add 50-150 μl/well of cell lysate depending on the desired signal for detection. It is essential to optimize the amount of cell lysate to obtain enough, but not saturated signals by the protein-of-interest. Prepare triplicate or quadruplicate samples for both CFTR and Ub detection. Negative control using cell lysate from BHK cells not expressing HBH-CFTR-3HA is necessary to measure the background signal.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191113/20191113233500_6919.jpgFigure 2. Assay template for ELISA based protein ubiquitylation measurement with negative control and two samples of HBH-∆F508 CFTR-3HA in BHK cells.",
    "Cell lysate from BHK cells not expressing HBH-ΔF508 CFTR-3HA is used as a negative control to measure the background signal. BHK cells stably expressing HBH-ΔF508 CFTR-3HA were treated with 10 μM MG-132 for 3 h at 37 °C before the cell lysis.Incubate for 2 h at 4 °C.Wash the plate with the Wash buffer (400 μl/well) once.Note: If the target protein tends to aggregate, add detergent in all the steps. Add Denaturing buffer (100 μl/well) (Recipe 6) and incubate for 5 min at RT (Room Temperature).Wash the plate with the Urea wash buffer (400 μl/well) (Recipe 7) for 5 times.Detection of the CFTR ubiquitylation by ELISABlock the CFTR-immobilized plate with the Blocking buffer (100 μl/well) for 20 min at RT.Add the primary antibody (50 μl/well) diluted with Blocking buffer according to Figure 2, and incubate for 1 h at RT.Note: For the primary antibody, the following conditions may work: Anti-Lys48 specific ubiquitin antibody (Apu2) (1:500); Anti-Lys63 specific ubiquitin antibody (Apu3) (1:500). Wash the plate with the Wash buffer (400 μl/well) 4 times.Add 50 μl/well of the secondary antibody diluted with the Blocking buffer according to Figure 2, and incubate for 45-60 min at RT.Note: For the secondary antibody, the following conditions may work: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000); HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000). Wash the plate with the Wash buffer (400 μl/well) 6 times.Add SuperSignalTM West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (100 μl/well) and incubate for 5 min at RT.Read the luminescence signal by SkanItTM software in Varioskan® Flash plate reader (Figure 3).The CFTR ubiquitylation level quantified by the anti-Ub antibody is normalized for the CFTR level quantified by the anti-HA antibody (Figure 4).Note: For normalization by the target protein, measure the amount of immobilized protein.",
    "If the target protein’s signal is too strong, reduce the amount of cell lysate to prevent the saturation of the signal.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191113/20191113233538_8374.jpgFigure 3. Protocol in SkanItTM software. The luminescence signal is measured by the Varioskan® Flash plate reader with the SkanItTM software. The protocol consists of 3 steps (boxed in red). 1st step is shaking the plate for 5 s. 2nd step is incubation (Pause) for 3 min. 3rd step is the luminescence measurement in a second.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191113/20191113233602_4535.jpgFigure 4. A typical result of the HBH-∆F508 CFTR-3HA ubiquitylation in BHK cells by ELISA according to Figure 2. A. The amount of HBH-ΔF508 CFTR-3HA immobilized on the NeutrAvidin plate (8 μg/well cell lysate) was measured using anti-HA antibody. B-C. The amount of K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (B) (80 μg/well cell lysate) and K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (C) (80 μg/well cell lysate) on the immobilized CFTR was measured using anti-K48-Ub and anti-K63-Ub antibodies, respectively. D-E. The amount of K48-linked poly-ubiquitylation (D) and K63-linked poly-ubiquitylation (E) of HBH-ΔF508 CFTR-3HA was quantitated after the normalization for the CFTR level quantified by the anti-HA antibody."
