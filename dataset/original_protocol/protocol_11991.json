    "All experimental procedures were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the CNIC (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares) and the Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid to ensure minimal animal suffering.\n1. Collection of Embryos from Pregnant Mice (from E8.5 to E12.5)\nSacrifice pregnant mice by either cervical dislocation or CO2 inhalation. The day of the first observed vaginal plug was considered embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5).\nLay the animal in the supine position on the absorbent pad and clean the abdominal skin of the mouse with 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Sterility is not required in the following steps.\nPinch and lift the abdominal skin using mouse-tooth forceps.\nMake an incision through the skin and the abdominal wall, 2 to 4 cm vertically across the midline of the abdomen using surgical scissors.\nExpose the abdomen and remove the uterine horns from the mother with forceps cutting blood vessels along the inner curvature of the uterus with surgical scissors.\nRemove the string of embryos and transfer it to a Petri dish on ice containing 10 mL ice-cold 0.01 M phosphate buffer saline pH 7.4 (PBS).\nCarefully dissect the embryos out from the uterus under a stereomicroscope in a Petri dish with 10 mL fresh ice-cold PBS. Grasp the muscle wall with watchmakers' forceps to expose the amniotic sac, and then tear the amniotic membrane to remove the enclosed embryo and the yolk sac using the tips of the forceps.\nCollect the littermate embryos from pregnant mice at early stages (from E8.5 to E12.5) (Figure 2).\nTransfer the embryos to a fresh dish with 10 mL cold 1x PBS using curved forceps or, for very small embryos (E8.5-E9.5), use plastic transfer pipettes to collect the samples without embryo damage.",
    "Before starting the fixation, take an embryonic sample in a microcentrifuge tube for genotyping by cutting a small piece of the embryo or taking the amniotic membrane in the smallest embryos (from E8.5 to E9.5) with watchmakers' forceps.\n\tNOTE: LacZ genotyping is determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers: forward, 5´-ATCGTGCGGTGGTTGAACTG-3´; reverse, 5´-CGAGGCGTTAACCGTCAGCA -3´.\n2. Fixation of Mouse Embryos\nTransfer each embryo into a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube with a rounded base containing 1 mL 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: Perform all steps in the protocol in these tubes with agitation using a rolling shaker.\nWash the embryos in 1x PBS for 1 min at room temperature to eliminate the remaining blood. Use plastic transfer pipettes to change liquids in the tubes.\nFix the embryo in 1 mL of 0.125% glutaraldehyde on ice.\n\tNOTE: The time of fixation depends on the size of the embryo: 20 min for E8.5-E9.5 embryos, 30 min for E10.5 embryos and 1 h for E12.5 embryos.\nRemove the fixative and wash the embryos in 1x PBS twice for 10 min at room temperature before processing the sample for X-gal staining.\n3. Whole Mount β-galactosidase Histochemistry of Mouse Embryos\nPrepare X-Gal Rinse buffer and X-Gal Staining Solution before starting the procedure (see Table 1 and Table of Materials). Use a wild-type (WT) littermate embryos as negative controls for the enzymatic reaction.\nIncubate the embryos in X-Gal Rinse buffer for 10 min at room temperature (Figure 2).",
    "Incubate the embryos in X-Gal Staining Solution from 2 h to overnight at 37 °C protected from light. Monitor the color reaction periodically via a dissecting microscope until sufficient intensity of blue staining is observed without the background in the embryo. Keep the pH of the solution between 8 and 9 to reduce background during the whole staining. If the staining solution begins to turn light, replace it with fresh substrate solution to extend the enzymatic reaction.\nStop the reaction when the desired signal is obtained by washing embryos in a microcentrifuge tube with 1 mL 1x PBS twice for 10 min each at room temperature.\nTransfer stained embryos to 1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to re-fix them, for 1 h to overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Embryos can be stored in 4% PFA/PBS for longer times at 4 °C or can be immediately processed for sectioning. This final fixation step is crucial for the long-term conservation of the staining pattern.\nWash the embryos in 1 mL 1x PBS twice for 10 min at room temperature.\nOption 1: Clear embryos by immersion in a series of solutions with increasing concentrations of glycerol (20%, 40%, 60% and 80% glycerol in 1x PBS) for 1 h at room temperature in each solution.\n\tNOTE: Wash embryos in 80% glycerol for longer times, even days, until they are cleared, and then store them in 80% glycerol at 4 °C at this step (Figure 2). Adding a very small amount of sodium azide ora crystal of thymol to the embryos stored at 4 °C either in glycerol or 1x PBS is recommended to prevent mold growth. After clearing, whole mount embryos can be used for photographing (step 4).",
    "Option 2: Process embryos for paraffin embedding and sectioning using a microtome (Figure 2). Document the expression pattern in whole stained embryos before sectioning (steps 4 and 5).\n4. Photography of Whole Mount Embryos\nTo photograph whole mount stained embryos prior to sectioning, transfer them to a Petri dish prepared with a base of solidified 1-2% agarose in 1x PBS.\nCover the embryo completely with 10 mL 1x PBS in the agarose-coated dishes to prevent dehydration and reflection while photographing through the liquid.\nOrientate the embryo immersed in 1x PBS using forceps. For older embryos (E10.5-E12.5), make a small hole in the agarose with forceps to place and position the specimen within it at different angles and to avoid the free-floating during photography.\nPlace the dish on the stereomicroscope stage, using the transmitted (under-stage) light. Change between the 'dark-field' and 'bright-field' adjustments to set the desired illumination during photography and to optimize the translucency of the sample.\n\tNOTE: Use fiber optic illumination for later-stage embryos to avoid reflection at the surface of the embryo. When photographing cleared embryos, follow the same procedure but transfer them to a Petri dish containing 100% glycerol and fully immerse them.\n5. Paraffin Embedding and Sectioning of X-gal Stained Embryos\nParaffin wax embedding\n\t\nRemove the X-gal stained embryos from 4 °C (step 3.5) and wash them with 1 mL 1x PBS three times to eliminate the excess of fixative.\nTransfer each embryo to a histology cassette using forceps.\nPlace the cassettes containing the embryos in a beaker and then dehydrate by passing them through a graded ethanol series at room temperature: 70% ethanol, once for 30 min; 96% ethanol, twice for 30 min each; 100% ethanol, twice for 30 min each.",
    "NOTE: Embryos can be stored in 70% ethanol for an undetermined time at 4 °C until starting the dehydration process.\nIncubate the whole cassette in isopropanol for 30 min at room temperature.\nBy using forceps, transfer the cassettes to a glass staining trough containing pre-warmed isopropanol and leave in an oven at 60 °C for 30 min.\nPlace the cassettes in a new glass staining trough containing a mixture of 50% isopropanol/ 50% melted paraffin wax and leave for 4 h in a 60 °C oven.\nIncubate the cassettes with the embryos with two changes of molten paraffin wax, 30 min at 60 °C each.\nAt the end of the final paraffin wash, open the cassette and transfer each embryo to a separate tissue embedding mold to view the sample under a stereomicroscope.\nFill the well with molten paraffin wax at 60 °C. Use heated forceps to keep the wax molten and carefully orientate the embryo in the mold.\n\t\tNOTE: The proper orientation of the sample is a critical step for sectioning the embryo in the desired plane.\nBefore paraffin solidifies in the mold, place a cassette without the lid on the top of the block and fill it with molten paraffin wax. Let the remaining wax cool until solidified overnight at room temperature.\nOnce the paraffin is completely solidified, remove the solid block from the mold and store the paraffin blocks either at room temperature or at 4 °C until sectioning14.\nParaffin Sectioning\n\t\nOrient the blade on the microtome and set up 5-7 µm of thickness. 5.2.2. Cool the paraffin block on the ice and trim it to produce a cube or a pyramid.\nAttach the block to the microtome holder by using a small amount of molten wax.",
    "Orient the block for optimal cutting. Section the paraffin blocks into 5-7 µm thick slices at room temperature using standard microtome.\nUsing a fine paintbrush, place the sections in a water bath at room temperature for manipulating and selecting slices.\nPick up sections from the water bath with a microscope slide and transfer them into a water bath at 42 °C for stretching.\nRemove sections from the water bath and gently place them onto adhesion microscope slides.\nDry the slides well in an oven at 37 °C overnight to allow the sections to completely adhere, otherwise, they may get lost during the staining.\n\t\tNOTE: Store the slides at 4 °C until starting staining procedures.\nDeparaffinization and Counterstaining of X-Gal-stained Paraffin Sections\n\t\nPut the slides on a microscope-slide tray in an oven at 60 °C for at least 45 min to make the paraffin wax more fluid.\nTransfer the slides onto a rack and use glass staining dishes to perform the following steps: submerge the rack in the staining jars containing alcohols of decreasing concentrations for complete paraffin removal and hydration of the tissues: isopropanol for 5 min at 60 °C; isopropanol for 3 min; 100% ethanol for 2 min; 96% ethanol for 1 min; 70% ethanol for 1 min at room temperature.\nRinse sections in distilled water twice to make sure that there are no alcohol residues.\nCounterstain sections with a stain (e.g. Nuclear-Fast Red solution) for 5 min (usually between 3-8 min) at room temperature (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: This staining helps to reveal overall tissue structure in the sections.\nAfter staining, wash the slides in distilled water for 1 min and check section staining in the microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: If the desired staining is too weak, counterstain sections again for a longer time.",
    "Dehydrate sections in the following series with increasing concentrations of ethanol: two washes in 95% ethanol for 2 min each, two washes in 100% ethanol for 2 min each, and, to avoid dissolving the blue color precipitates, just one quick wash in xylene.\nRemove the slides from the rack one by one and place them on a piece of paper. Then mount and coverslip each slide using a synthetic, permanent mounting medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Xylene is a flammable product whose vapors are irritating and harmful to human health and to aquatic organisms. It needs to be manipulated within a hood and requires the use of proper protective equipment.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
