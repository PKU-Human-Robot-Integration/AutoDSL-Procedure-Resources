The number of animals to culture for each seCLIP experiment will depend on several factors, including the RBP transgene expression level, the number of cells expressing the transgene, and the efficiency of immunoprecipitation of the target RBP. As a guideline, we obtained sufficient yields to build high-quality seCLIP libraries with ∼200 μL pelleted C. elegans expressing 3×FLAG::EIF-3.G transgene in the cholinergic motor neurons (driven by Punc-17B).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Users should adjust the volume of animals depending on the transgene expression variables.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2351-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

UMI: unique molecular identifier used to bioinformatically detect PCR duplicates.\n(K) Data analysis.\nCulture each C. elegans strain on 12 large NGM plates (150 mm) seeded with OP50 bacteria at the required temperature for 3–4 days.\nPick ∼10 adult hermaphrodites each onto 4 small seeded nematode growth media (NGM) plates (10 cm) and culture 20°C for ∼3 days.",
    "Slice the small plates into quarters and transfer these NGM chunks to 12 large 30 cm NGM plates.\nPlates are ready to harvest when they become confluent with C. elegans, nearly exhausting the bacterial lawn (typically ∼3–4 days at 20°C).\nCritical: Before harvesting, briefly examine the animals under a low power dissection microscope to ensure they appear healthy. It is not recommended to harvest C. elegans from plates after which the bacterial lawn is exhausted, as many of the animals will begin to experience starvation that could influence RBP activity.\nNote: If desired, it is also possible to culture worms from specific larval stages using a modified protocol (for example12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nHarvest C. elegans:\nPour a volume of M9 media enough to cover the surface of the large NGM plate and swirl the solution, allowing the animals to lift off the NGM surface.\nTransfer M9 with animals into 15 mL conical tubes.\nPellet the animals by centrifugation:\nCentrifuge animals at 523 × g for 2 min.\nDiscard the M9 suspension without disturbing the animal pellet.\nResuspend the animals in M9 to 15 mL.\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 as necessary until C. elegans are harvested from all 12 NGM plates.\nNote: Washing animals confluent on 12 large NGM plates typically yields ∼200 μL of pelleted animals.\nRemove gut bacteria from pelleted animals:\nTransfer the animal pellet into a 5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nResuspend the pellet in 5 mL of M9 media.\nAttach the 5 mL tube with harvested animals onto a rotator and rotate end to end for 10 min.\nWash the animal pellet:\nCentrifuge at 523 × g for 2 min to pellet animals.\nRemove the M9 supernatant and add M9 media to 5 mL.\nRepeat steps a and b one time.\nPrepare animals for crosslinking:",
    "Using a glass pipette, transfer animals onto two large (150 mm) unseeded NGM plates.\nAllow the liquid to evaporate and the animals to spread in an even lawn across the plate surface (∼5–10 min).\nNote: If needed, animals may be distributed onto more than two large unseeded NGM plates.\nPre-cool a small tabletop centrifuge (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to 4°C.\nInsert the animals into the Spectrolinker XL-1000 UV irradiator and initialize crosslinking using an energy setting of 3 kJ/m2.\nCritical: The success of crosslinking can be superficially judged by viewing the C. elegans plates under a dissection microscope. Crosslinked animals will be largely immobilized as though they are frozen in place.\nWash the crosslinked animals from the large NGM plates:\nPour a volume of M9 media enough to cover the surface of the large NGM plate and swirl the solution, allowing the animals to lift off the NGM surface.\nTransfer M9 with animals into 15 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge animals at 523 × g for 2 min.\nDiscard the M9 suspension without disturbing the animal pellet.\nResuspend the animals in M9 to 15 mL.\nRepeat this step as necessary until all C. elegans are harvested.\nTransfer animals:\nRemove the M9 supernatant, leaving approximately 5 mL C. elegans suspended in M9 media.\nTransfer the 5 mL pellet and M9 into a new 5 mL Eppendorf tube using a glass pipette.\nNote: The extra volume of M9 merely serves to facilitate transfer of the animals.\nPellet animals:\nCentrifuge the 5 mL Eppendorf tube with animals at 523 × g for 2 min.\nRemove as much of the M9 supernatant as possible without disrupting the animal pellet.\nPause point: Worm pellets may be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for up to 2 months.",
    "Resuspend the animals in 4 mL C. elegans lysis buffer and immediately transfer the tube to ice.\nSonicate the crosslinked C. elegans suspension with seven pulses (10 s each, power setting 11) with 50 s rest on ice in between pulses.\nCritical: Ensure the samples remain chilled on ice during the entire sonication procedure to avoid overheating the proteins.\nClarify lysates:\nClear the lysates by spinning at 5,242 × g for 5 min in the small tabletop centrifuge pre- cooled to 4°C.\nCarefully move the cleared lysate (4 mL), splitting the volume into four 2 mL Eppendorf tubes (1 mL lysate each).\nDiscard the insoluble pellet.\nNote: Splitting the lysate volume into four tubes serves to promote better mixing during the following RNase treatment steps.\nPause point: Lysates may be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for up to 1 week, if desired. Samples may be thawed exactly once when ready to proceed. Avoid multiple freeze thaws.\nRNase treatment of C. elegans lysates\nTiming: 25 min\nIn this step, clarified lysates are treated with RNase to fragment the total RNA in order to generate RBP associated RNA fragments that will be immunoprecipitated in subsequent steps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: In all proceeding steps, 'gently flick to mix' refers to manually flicking the reaction tube and firmly tapping the tube on the table surface to gather the liquid to the tube bottom. Keep in mind that excessive force (such as vortexing) can damage RNA and enzymes.\nAdd 2 μL Turbo DNase to each 1 mL lysate sample, gently flick to mix, and return to ice.\nDilute RNase I 1:25 in 1× ice-cold PBS.\nAdd 10 μL of the diluted RNase I to each lysate and gently flick to mix.\nIncubate the lysates in Thermomixer at 37°C for 5 min.",
    "Immediately transfer the samples to ice, then add 11 μL Murine RNase Inhibitor and pipette to mix.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min.\nCombine the four 1 mL RNase treated lysates reactions into two tubes (2 mL each), which will here forward serve as biological/technical replicates.\nImmediately proceed to step 22.\nImmunoprecipitation of RBP-RNA complexes\nTiming: ∼16 h\nIn seCLIP, RBP binding sites are identified based on the enrichment of read clusters mapped from the immunoprecipitated RBP (referred to as CLIP) versus an input control (designated as Input). The following steps will describe cDNA library preparation from both CLIP and Input (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). We recommend generating and sequencing at least two biological replicate seCLIP libraries for all samples and controls.\nAliquot 125 μL anti-FLAG magnetic beads into a 2 mL Eppendorf tube.\nNote: The anti-FLAG beads are too viscous to aspirate with most pipette tips. We recommend pipetting the bead suspension with a blunted P200 pipette tip cut with a razor.\nWash the anti-FLAG beads (one tube per replicate):\nResuspend the anti-FLAG beads in 500 μL 1× TBS.\nGently vortex the beads.\nMagnetically separate the beads (using the magnetic rack; approximately 10 s).\nRemove the supernatant.\nRepeat steps a through d one time.\nAdd 2 mL of the RNase treated lysate to the beads and incubate at 4°C overnight (∼16 h) on a rotator (total volume ∼2.125 mL).\nPause point: Samples are incubated overnight (∼16 h).\nRemove Input Samples:\nTake 20 μL of the beads and lysate sample mixture to a new tube and store at 4°C for the Preparative gel.\nTake 20 μL of the beads and lysate sample mixture to a new tube and store at 4°C for the Imaging gel.",
    "Critical: These will be used for the western blotting step described in step 44. Keep input samples at −80°C if storing them >1 day.\nWash beads:\nMagnetically separate beads and remove the supernatant.\nWash beads (thoroughly resuspend them) with 900 μL 1×TBS.\nRepeat steps a and b one time.\nMagnetically separate beads and remove the supernatant.\nWash beads (thoroughly resuspend them) with 500 μL 1×TBS.\nRepeat steps d and e one time.\nImmediately proceed to step 27.\nOn-bead RNA dephosphorylation and 3′ adapter ligation\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis step will dephosphorylate the immunoprecipitated RNA fragments (CLIP samples only) and ligate the 3′ end with the InvRil19 adapter, which will later be used as a priming site for RT-PCR (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Note that all steps are performed on the beads used for IP.\nAcclimate beads in 1×TAP buffer:\nRemove the 500 μL 1×TBS.\nThoroughly resuspend beads in 500 μL 1×TAP buffer.\nMagnetically separate beads and remove the supernatent.\nRepeat steps b and c one more time.\nOn ice, prepare the TAP master mix (100 μL per sample):\nAdd 79 μL H2O, 10 μL 10× FastAP Buffer (Thermo Fisher, EF0654), 2 μL Murine RNase Inhibitor, 1 μL Turbo DNase, and 8 μL TAP enzyme to a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube.\nGently flick tube to mix.\nAdd the TAP master mix:\nRemove the 500 μL 1×TAP buffer from the last sample wash in step 27.\nAdd 100 μL of the TAP master mix to each sample.\nIncubate in Thermomixer at 1200 rpm, 37°C for 15 min.\nPrepare the PNK master mix on ice (300 μL per sample): Add 224 μL H2O, 60 μL 5×PNK buffer (pH 6.5), 3 μL DTT (0.1 M), 5 μL Murine RNase Inhibitor, 1 μL Turbo DNase, and 7 μL T4 PNK enzyme to a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube.",

    "Western blotting is used to make the target RBP-RNA complex visible so that the RNA can be isolated for cDNA preparation. The seCLIP strategy uses two PAGE gels: the imaging gel is used for western blot detection of the protein to verify the target RBP was successfully immunoprecipitated, and the preparative gel is used for isolation of the RBP-RNA complex. The Input and CLIP samples will be run on both imaging and preparative gels. The RBP-RNA complexes from Input and CLIP will subsequently be isolated from the preparative membrane, the proteins are removed with Proteinase K, and the RNA purified in preparation for subsequent cDNA library generation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nTerminate the ligation reaction:\nMagnetically separate beads and entirely remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 100 μL 1× TBS and pipette to mix.\nMove 20 μL of each sample to a new 1.5 mL eppendorf tube for the Imaging gel.\nAfter magnetically separating the remaining beads and removing supernatant, resuspend the beads in 20 μL cold IP wash buffer.\nNote: These samples will be loaded on the Preparative gel.\nThaw on ice the imaging and preparative input samples (if stored at −80°C).\nPrepare NuPAGE mix (per sample): 0.75 μL β-mercaptoethanol + 6.75 μL Laemmli Buffer (4×).\nTo each Input and CLIP sample (20 μL), add: 7.5 μL NuPAGE mix + 3 μL DTT (1 M).\nDenature all samples:\nIncubate all samples for 10 min in a Thermomixer (1,200 rpm at 70°C).\nCool the samples on ice for 1 min before loading on the TGX™ Precast Protein gel.\nWhile denaturing samples:\nThaw the protein ladder (we prefer the Precision Plus Dual Color Standard from BioRad).\nPrepare a diluted ladder mix for each sample: 2 μL ladder + 2 μL 4× NuPAGE buffer + 6 μL 1× TBS.\nLoad the preparative gel:",
    "Load 13 μL protein ladder (un-diluted) in lane 1.\nLoad the entire 30 μL volume of preparative samples (both CLIP and Input) in all other lanes with 10 μL diluted ladder mix loaded in between samples.\nNote: It is helpful to load the input and CLIP for each sample side by side (with diluted ladder mix in between). The alternating diluted ladder helps to space apart samples in the preparative gel to prevent cross contaminating sampes when protein-RNA complexes are isolated in step 65.\nLoad the imaging gel:\nLoad 13 μL protein ladder (un-diluted) in the first lane.\nLoad 15 μL of each imaging gel sample (both CLIP and Input) and save the remaining volume at −80°C as a back-up.\nNote: it is not necessary to load diluted ladder between samples in the imaging gel, as the protein-RNA complex will not be excised from the imaging gel.\nRun the preparative and imaging gels:\nRun both gels in 1× Running Buffer at 80 volts for 20 min.\nAfter 20 min, increase voltage to 100 volts and run for 35 additional minutes (or until the dye front is near the bottom of the gel).\nWhile the gels are running, prepare 1× western blot transfer buffer and pre-cool at 4°C.\nPrepare a PVDF membrane for the imaging gel:\nIncubate PVDF membrane in 100% methanol for 30 s.\nSubmerge membrane in ddH2O for 30 s.\nLeave membrane in transfer buffer (at least 30 s).\nPrepare a nitrocellulose membrane for the preparative gel by pre-soaking the nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer only (Do not submerge nitrocellulose in methanol).\nFor each preparative and imaging gels, assemble the western blot transfer sandwich from anode (black side) to cathode (red) in the following order:\n1 sponge (Biorad, 1703930).\n3 pieces of Whatman paper.",

    "qPCR is used to estimate the quantity of template cDNA in order to determine the number of PCR cycles needed for PCR amplification of the cDNA library. Note that it is not necessary to perform the qPCR in replicates. If desired to confirm accuracy of qPCR results, users can perform a duplicate PCR using a 1:100 dilution of the sample cDNA, which should yield a CT ∼3 cycles above the 1:10 cDNA dilution. After qPCR, cDNA libraries are generated using primers containing indexes for Single-end sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq instruments (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).
