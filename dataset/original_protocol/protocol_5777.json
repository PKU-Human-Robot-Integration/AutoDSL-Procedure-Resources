    "Note: For the animal experiment included in the protocol, please refer to specific regulations in your institute. In our study, all animal studies were conducted according to the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Biomedical Research Ethics Committee. Day 0: Extraction of bone marrow cells Note: The volumes of medium or buffer in the procedures are for one mouse. Adjust the volume if handling multiple mice.Sacrifice a mouse aged between 4-7 weeks by cervical dislocation and quickly sterilize the body surface with 70% ethanol.Immediately dissect out the hinder limbs of the mouse by cutting at the ankle and the upper end of the thigh with scissors. Remove skin and muscle to reveal bones. Dislocate the femur and tibia by cutting at the knee with scissors. Rinse bones twice with pre-cooled PBS to remove excessive muscle tissues (Figure 1A).Remove both ends of each piece of bone (Figure 1B) and flush the bone marrow cells out with a 29 gauge syringe. Use 0.5 ml α-MEM per bone and temporarily collect cell solution in a 6 cm Petri dish (Figure 1C). Note: If bone marrow cells do not flow out easily, stir within the bone cavity with the syringe needle briefly to mobilize cells.Pipet the resultant cell solution gently and filter it through a 40 µm mesh cell strainer (Figure 1D) into a 15 ml conical tube. This step is to remove unwanted cell clusters and bone matrix. Collect cells via centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard supernatant.Resuspend cell pellets in 200 µl α-MEM and add 2 ml diluted red blood cell lysing buffer.",
    "Gently mix the solution by inverting the tube a couple of times and then leave at room temperature for 5-10 min until the solution becomes transparent red (Figure 1E).Note: Prepare the red blood cell lysing buffer just before use. Red blood cell lysing buffer is supplied as 10x stock. Dilute it with deionized water to the working concentration. Collect cells by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets should be almost white at this stage. If not, repeat Steps A5 and A6. Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 ml culture medium and culture in a 10 cm Petri dish in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator overnight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180531/20180531202827_3479.jpgFigure 1.

Primary bone marrow cells before (left), during (middle) and after (right) red blood cell lysis; F. Representative image of mature osteoclasts. Scale bar = 50 µm.Day 1: OsteoclastogenesisCollect suspended myeloid precursor cells in a 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend cell pellets in 1 ml culture medium and count cell number by hemacytometer. Note: Usually 1-2 x 107 cells can be obtained with one mouse at this step.Place sterilized coverslips into the central 8 wells of 24 well plates.Note: Usually four replicates are required for each setting.Dilute cell solution with culture medium or culture medium/conditioned medium mixture to the concentration of 1.6-2.0 x 106/ml. Aliquot 2 ml cell solution for each setting (four replicates). Add M-CSF (final concentration, 25 ng/ml) and RANKL (final concentration, 50 ng/ml) stock to their final concentration.",
    "Note: The final concentration of rRANKL may vary and please refer to Notes section for guidance.If specific cytokines or chemicals are of interest, please also add them into the cell aliquots. Gently but thoroughly pipet the cell solution and transfer 500 µl mixtures to each of the four replicates.Day 4: Refresh medium with the same medium recipe as Day 1Day 7: TRAP staining for mature osteoclastsConduct staining procedures of coverslips following the manufacturer’s protocol (Sigma). Here is the Sigma protocol with our modification:Note: The whole fixation and staining procedures can be conducted in the same multi-well plate of osteoclast differentiation. Prepare Fixative Solution by combining 25 ml Citrate solution (provided by the staining kit), 65 ml acetone and 8 ml 37% formaldehyde. Place Fixative Solution in glass bottles and cap tightly. Fixative solution is stable up to 2 months at 2-8 °C and discard if evaporation is observed.Pre-warm sufficient deionized water (at least 10 ml for each well) to 37 °C for the whole assay, including washes before and after staining. Bring Fixative Solution to room temperature (18-26 °C). Aspirate culture medium and rinse once with PBS. Fix cells on coverslips by adding 500 µl Fixative Solution/well for 30 sec. Rinse thoroughly in deionized water: Do not allow slides to dry.To a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube add 0.5 ml Fast Garnet GBC Base Solution and 0.5 ml Sodium Nitrite Solution. Mix by gentle inversion for 30 sec. Let it stand for 2 min.Prepare staining solution in the “Beaker B” column (45 ml deionized water pre-warmed to 37 °C, 1.0 ml diazotized Fast Garnet GBC solution from Step D1d, 0.5 ml Naphthol AS-BI Phosphate solution, 2.0 ml Acetate Solution and 1.0 ml Tartrate Solution). Note: All solutions except deionized water are provided by the staining kit.",
    "Add at least 500 µl staining solution to each well. Place multi-well plates in a 37 °C incubator for 1 h and protect plates from light.Aspirate staining solution and rinse several times with deionized water. Carefully take cover slips out and air dry them.Mount of air-dried coverslipsTake a clean glass slide and place one drop of 20 µl neutral balsam onto the slide. Carefully hold coverslips on the edge, facing the surface with cells toward glass slide, and slowly mount to avoid air bubbles. Count results within one week after mounting. Mature osteoclasts are TRAP-positive cells with ≥ 3 nuclei and diameter ≥ 50 µm (Figure 1F).Note: We usually count TRAP-positive multi-nuclei cells of a whole coverslip to collect data. It is not suggested to collect data by taking random snapshots since it is very difficult to pre-determine how many snapshots are sufficient to estimate the number of osteoclasts."
