  "procedures": [
    "1. Digester Construction\nSelect a digester vessel that contains all the features shown in Fig. 1 (a cone is not necessary), and your desired working volume (typically between 1-10 L). If your digester vessel is not equipped with a heated-water jacket, place the digester in some other temperature-controlled environment, such as a heated water bath or incubation chamber.\nSecure the vessel in a vertical position in an area with sufficient horizontal bench space for placement of remaining components (Table 2).\nConstruct the vessel lid according to Fig. 2. The ports of the influent and effluent tubes should be wide enough to prevent clogging. The tubes inside the bioreactor should be of sufficient length to stay submerged in the digester medium during decanting, while extending out from the top of the lid to allow attachment of tubing. The impeller sheathing should extend as far as possible into the digester medium (the submerged tubing and sheathing prevent headspace biogas from escaping the bioreactor).\nApply silicone-based vacuum grease to the contact surface of the lid and clamp it to the digester vessel top.\nSecure the variable speed mixer parallel to the digester's vertical axis using a ring-stand and clamps, then affix impeller shaft. Because of mixer motor vibrations and movement it is important to use an independent and free moving stand.\nConnect a section of flexible tubing to both the influent and effluent tubes and then connect another section of tubing to the gas port to be used as the gas line.",
    "Connect the biogas line to each of the various components, which can be placed above the digester on shelving. The components should be connected in this order: sampling port, foam trap, H2S scrubber, gas reservoir, bubbler, gas meter, and ventilation line (Fig. 3). To facilitate isolation or removal of individual components for troubleshooting or cleaning purposes, consider adding valves and connecter fittings between components. Make sure that the gas outlet is properly ventilated to the outside or a chemical hood because biogas is explosive.\n \nThe gas sampling port should be positioned near the reactor headspace.\nThe foam trap can be constructed using a simple flask or bottle, and should be at least 25% of the reactor volume. It should contain two ports, one for the biogas inlet line and the other for the biogas outlet line. These ports can be made by drilling two holes in a rubber stopper through which rigid tubing is inserted. The biogas inlet tube should extend to a greater depth than the biogas outlet tube (Fig. 4). Foam trapping is necessary to protect the gas handling system from possible digester foam.\nThe H2S scrubber consists of a long glass tube, with an inner diameter greater than 2 cm, filled with steel wool with a biogas inlet and outlet port on either end. The steel wool should be packed well to provide enough surface area for stripping, but not so tightly that biogas flow is blocked. Scrubbing is necessary to protect metal components in the gas meter from corrosive chemicals.",
    "The gas reservoir can be made out of any collapsible, air-tight material, such as a gas bag, or even a children's play ball, with a volume exceeding twice the targeted feed volume. This is necessary to prevent a pressure drop during decanting effluent and possible air suction into the headspace.\nIf the system will be temperature controlled by a circulating water heater, connect the heater to the heating jacket using flexible tubing. Place the unit above the liquid level of the heating jacket. Set the heater to the appropriate temperature for mesophilic or thermophilic digestion (Table 1).\nPerform a leak test of the system by detecting leaks with soapy water. Start by filling the digester tank with water, then slightly pressurize the influent line with a gas to a pressure less than 5 psi. First, clamp the biogas line and effluent lines to check for leaks around the reactor lid, and then remove the biogas line clamp to test for leaks for the entire gas handling system. Note that over-pressurization of the influent line will force water out through the impeller sheathing tube.\nTurn on the impeller and heating element and let run overnight to ensure that the mixer and heater can sustain continuous operation. The rotational speed of the impeller should be fast enough to ensure complete mixing of the reactor media. Common mixer problems include misalignment, excessive friction of the shaft, and inadequate securing of the motor to the ring-stand.\n2. Digester Inoculation and Conditioning using an Active Methanogenic Biomass",
    "Store the active methanogenic biomass (inoculum) in a closed container in a refrigerator at 4 °C while preparing the digesters. Ideally, the inoculum should be stored for as little time as possible and there should be enough to completely fill the entire volume of the digester. However, certain anaerobic biomass (such as granular biomass) can be stored for very long periods. Dilute the inoculum with water that was flushed with an anaerobic gas to the appropriate volume if necessary.\nFlush the empty digester system with anaerobic gas for several minutes by connecting it to the feeding tube, clamping the effluent line, and taping the space between the mixer axle and sheath to prevent excessive loss of anaerobic gas.\nDuring the flushing period, make sure to flush-out the gas reservoir.\nAfter flushing is complete, connect a funnel to the feeding tube and add the inoculum making sure to mix the inoculum periodically to ensure uniformity.\nReconnect the anaerobic gas to the feeding tube, turn-on the mixer, and flush the digester liquor for at least 15 min. Then disconnect the gas, clamp the feed tube and unclamp the gas reservoir. This digester is now in operation.\nAllow the digester to operate for a couple of days before commencing feeding and monitor the production of biogas. During this time, perform total solids and volatile solids concentration analysis for the inoculum (Table 1). If the solids concentration is considerably greater than that of the target mixed liquor concentration, remove and dilute digester contents accordingly before commencing feeding. This is done to prevent excessive washout of biomass during the operating period that may increase the Food to Microorganism (F/M) ratio too sharply throughout the startup period.",
    "Determine the organic biodegradable fraction of the substrate by measuring either the total and volatile solids concentration, biological or chemical oxygen demand, or total organic carbon of the substrate. Use this value to calculate a conservative initial organic loading rate (OLR).\nThe operator should gradually increase the OLR until a target value is reached (start-up period). One approach during the start-up period is to fix the organic strength of the feed, and then reduce the hydraulic retention time (HRT) incrementally until the target OLR is achieved (a process that may take several months to a year depending on the quality of the inoculum and the substrate used). Increasing the OLR too quickly will lead to excessive concentrations of volatile fatty acids (>2,000 mg/L as acetate) as shown in Fig. 5. The operator should reduce the OLR if volatile fatty acid concentrations increase to suboptimum levels (Table 1). If the volatile fatty acid concentrations are too high, the contents of the bioreactor may need to be diluted with water.\nAllow the digester a period of three HRTs at the target OLR before experimentation to establish a stable base-line condition.\n3. Digester Operation\nEffluent decanting always precedes substrate addition to the digester, so immediately before decanting, prepare the feed mixture and store at 4 °C until it is time to feed.\nDecant effluent from the digester by connecting the effluent tubing to a pump (side-arm flask under vacuum is one possibility of decanting) and remove an equal volume compared to the feed volume. Store the effluent at 4 °C for later analysis. Note that many of the analyses are time sensitive. For example, the pH should be measured immediately because CO2 escapes from the solution, increasing the pH.",
    "Remove the feed mixture from the refrigerator. Connect a funnel to the feed tube and pour in the feed (substrate) making sure to mix periodically to ensure that the solids get carried in with the bulk fluid.\nPerform troubleshooting steps outlined in Table 3, if necessary.\n4. System Monitoring\nCheck the digester system and its components frequently during operation. Particular attention should be paid to the mixing and heating systems. Insufficient mixing will manifest in an abrupt decrease in effluent solids concentration (Fig. 6). Periodically check that the oil or water in the gas meters is at the appropriate level and replace the steel wool in the H2S trap as needed. Note that the steel wool will become black and glossy as it reacts with H2S to form iron sulfide.\nPerform these analyses on digester effluent for diagnosis of system performance and stability. The values should consistently fall within the specified optimum range indicated in Table 1.\n \nMeasure the biogas production rate and pH every feeding cycle.\nMeasure the volatile fatty acid concentration, alkalinity, and biogas content multiple times a week. Note: The biogas content should be measured at the same time relative to the feeding cycle since its composition will change over the course of the cycle. Ideally, the biogas should be sampled at the end of a feeding cycle, just prior to feeding.\nMeasure the biological or chemical oxygen demand and total and volatile solids once a week or more often to obtain at least three data points for each experimental condition at pseudo-steady state conditions.\n5. Representative Results",
    "Successful inoculation of the digester is marked by the production of biogas within several days. The methane to carbon dioxide ratio of the biogas will increase during the acclimatization period as more methanogenic biomass is recruited. The slow growth of methanogens compared to acidogens makes long acclimatization periods and gradual operational changes necessary. In Fig. 5, we demonstrate the dynamic response of a digester when a high organic loading rate (OLR) is introduced too early in the start-up phase. In this example, there was insufficient methanogenic biomass to remove (i.e., utilize) the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) evolved from the substrate degradation step, acidogenesis. This led to an accumulation of VFAs, and subsequently, a reduction in the pH. To rectify this situation, the OLR was reduced to limit the production of VFAs by acidogens and to allow greater methanogen recruitment before returning to the higher OLR. The digesters then exhibited stable digestion for three hydraulic retention periods.\nStable digestion or pseudo-steady-state conditions can be assumed when the measured parameters, such as the biogas production rates, total VFA concentrations, volatile solids concentrations, and pH levels, are consistently maintained within 10% of their average values, for a minimum time period of one HRT. The significance of this allotment is revealed in Fig. 6, which shows the prolonged response of the CSTR system to a perturbation caused by insufficient mixing. The lack of proper mixing allowed the solids to settle in the reactor, which meant fewer solids were removed during effluent decanting. Their accumulation resulted in higher effluent solids concentrations after sufficient mixing was restored. It took approximately one HRT (i.e., 25 days) to return the digester to a normal effluent solids concentration.",
    "An anaerobic digester is a biological system; thus it will exhibit some internal variability in performance. This variability must be quantified before the experimenter can discern the specific effects caused by experimental perturbations imposed on the system (the proper use of statistics is required). Three HRT periods are required before an experimental change is made to the reactor system because this is generally considered an adequate period of time to assume stable concentrations of chemical species in the mixed liquor (Fig. 7). By the end of this interval, the experimenter should be able to construct a reliable baseline for each measured parameter. This baseline serves as a basis of comparison for future experimentation.\nThe general performance of the digester can be assessed by following the monitoring protocol, which requires that various standard analyses be executed routinely. This schedule provides adequate temporal resolution to identify precursors to most system problems and the lee time to prevent them. Furthermore, the results of these diagnostic tests are meant to be used in conjunction with Table 1 to identify suboptimum performance. Table 3 provides solutions to many of the problems typically encountered when setting-up a digester. In the event that a problem cannot be rectified by following the instructions outlined therein, the operator should consult other resources, such as a reference text pertaining to anaerobic biotechnology.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5\nOperation Parameters,Standard Methods Index,Typical Range,Typical Range,Extreme Range,Extreme Range\n,,Mesophilic,Thermophilic,Mesophilic,Thermophilic\nTemperature,2550(A),32-37 17 °C,50-60 17 °C,20-42 17 °C,45-65 17 °C\nOrganic Loading Rate,NL,0.8-2.0 17 g  VS-L-1-d-1,1.5-5.0 17 g  VS-L-1-d-1,0.4-6.4 17 g  VS-L-1-d-1,1.0-7.5 17 g  VS-L-1-d-1\nHydraulic Retention Time,NL,15 - 35 Days,15 - 35 Days,< 15 ; > 35 Days,< 15 ; > 35 Days\nCarbon: Nitrogen Ratio,NL,25:1 17,25:1 17,> 25:1,> 25:1\nMonitoring Parameters,Standard Methods Index,Optimum Range,Optimum Range,Suboptimum Range,Suboptimum Range",

Typical system response to a high organic loading rate (OLR) during reactor start-up. Beginning with an OLR of 1.35 gVS-L-1 caused the accumulation of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA). The acid accumulation caused a decrease in pH followed by a reduction in biogas yield. By lowering the OLR to 1.15 g VS-day-1, both systems were able to recover and establish a sufficient methanogenic biomass concentration to tolerate a 1.35 gVS-L-1 OLR.
