    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nNOTE: A schematic illustrating the approaches described in the paper is provided in Figure 1.\n1. Isolating Mouse Basal and Luminal Prostate Epithelial Cells Using Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) — TIMING: 30 Min\nNOTE: Perform steps 1.3-1.5 in the dark.\nAfter dissociating cells from total mouse prostate as described in Lawson et al.16, transfer the cells to FACS tubes and resuspend 0.1-5 x 106 cells in 100 µL of dissociation media (Table 1).\nAdd the appropriate volume of the following directly-conjugated primary antibodies: CD45, CD31, Ter-119, EpCAM and CD49f.\nIncubate on ice, protected from light, for 20 min.\nNOTE: It is recommended to utilize 10% of the total dissociated cells for unstained and single-stained controls. These controls are necessary to set the correct compensation and voltage for sorting.\nQuench antibody cocktail by adding 1 mL of dissociation media to each sample. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT) and remove the supernatant by aspirating.\nResuspend the cells in appropriate volume (250 µL per 1 x 106 cells) of dissociation media containing 1 µg/mL 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Proceed to FACS. Flow cytometry plots demonstrating isolation of mouse basal and luminal prostate epithelial cells are illustrated in Figure 2.\n2. Plating Sorted Prostate Epithelial Cells into Primary Mouse Organoid Culture — TIMING: 2-3 H (Excluding Poly-HEMA-coated Plate Preparation)",
    "NOTE: Plates are coated with Poly-HEMA to prevent 2D colony formation on the surface of the well beneath the matrix gel. Prepare Poly-HEMA-coated plates 1 day prior to plating sorted basal or luminal prostate epithelial cells into mouse organoid culture. Thaw 1 mL aliquots of reduced growth factor matrix gel, hereafter referred to as matrix gel, on ice 2 h prior to step 2.1. Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor) should be added to mouse organoid media immediately prior to step 2.1. Perform steps 2.1-2.8 on ice.\nPellet the cells in 5 mL round-bottom tubes by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant.\nWash the cell pellet in 500 µL of mouse organoid media (Table 2)14.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend in mouse organoid media at a cell density of 1,000 cells/µL.\nTo prepare master mixes, mix epithelial cells suspended in mouse organoid media with matrix gel to generate a final mixture that contains 25% cells/media and 75% matrix gel. Basal cells are typically plated at a concentration of 100-2,000 cells/80 µL, whereas luminal cells are typically plated at a concentration of 2,000-10,000 cells/80 µL. The density of cells plated varies depending upon the day of anticipated material collection, and the desired downstream application.\nNOTE: Chill appropriately sized tube(s) for expected master mix volume 5 min prior to master mix preparation. To ensure the matrix gel does not harden while handling, it is critical to chill the pipette tip by pipetting the matrix gel 3-4 times prior to transferring it to a new tube.",
    "Add 80 µL of the matrix gel/cell mixture per well of a 24-well plate. Pipetting a droplet onto the lower half of the wall of the well, while avoiding direct contact with the Poly-HEMA coating is recommended. After adding the matrix gel, swirl the plate to allow the matrix gel/cell mixture to form a ring around the rim of the well.\nPlace the 24-well plate into a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator right-side up for 10 min to allow the matrix gel to partially harden.\nNOTE: Begin warming mouse organoid media at 37 °C immediately after placing the 24-well plate in the incubator.\nAfter incubating for 10 min, flip the 24-well plate upside-down and incubate for an additional 50 min to allow the matrix gel to completely harden.\nAdd 350 µL of pre-warmed mouse organoid media dropwise to the center of each well.\nNOTE: To maintain the integrity of the matrix gel, it is critical to avoid the matrix gel ring while adding media.\nAfter adding the media, return the 24-well plate to the 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator.\n3. Replenishing Mouse Organoid Media — TIMING: 10-15 Min Per 24-well Plate\nNOTE: Existing media should be replaced with fresh media every 48 h. Before each media change, pre-warm mouse organoid media. It is not necessary to add ROCK inhibitor to the media used for replenishing.\nTilt the 24-well plate at a 45° angle and gently remove existing media from the center of each well using a p1000 pipette, while avoiding the matrix gel ring.\nAdd 350 µL of pre-warmed mouse organoid media as in step 2.9. It is recommended to add a larger volume of media (up to 1 mL) to organoids cultured for longer than 5 days in order to prevent rapid depletion of key nutrients and growth factors.",
    "4. Extracting Protein Lysate from Prostate Organoids for Western Blot Analysis — TIMING: 2.5-4 H\nNOTE: Prior to collecting organoids for protein lysate extraction, prepare and pre-warm dispase-containing media (Table 1).\nRemove the media from each well as in step 3.1.\nTo collect organoids, repeatedly blast the matrix gel by pipetting 1 mL of dispase-containing media directly onto the matrix gel ring until the entire ring is dislodged, and transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNOTE: It is critical to avoid direct contact with the Poly-HEMA-coated wells. Direct contact may cause contamination of the collected material with Poly-HEMA, which could negatively impact cell survival.\nPlace the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube(s) into a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min to 1 h to allow complete digestion of the matrix gel by dispase.\nPellet organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min at RT and remove the supernatant using a micropipette.\nAdd phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the organoid pellet and resuspend by gently flicking.\nNOTE: Failure to sufficiently resuspend the organoid pellet may result in the contamination of organoid material with residual dispase or matrix gel.\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 min at RT and remove the supernatant using a micropipette.\nFast freeze the organoid pellets by placing each tube into a solution containing dry ice and methanol. Store the tube(s) until future use at -80 °C. Alternatively, extract protein lysate immediately following step 4.6.\nResuspend the organoid pellets in 100 µL of protein lysis buffer (Table 1) per 10 µL of packed cell volume. Flick to resuspend.",
    "NOTE: If resuming after fast-freezing, ensure protein lysis buffer is thawed prior to removing samples from -80 °C, as lysis buffer must be added to samples immediately in order to prevent phosphatase and protease activity.\nIncubate the samples in protein lysis buffer on ice for at least 45 min.\nNOTE: It is recommended to sonicate prior to incubation on ice to increase the efficiency of nuclear protein recovery; however, sonication is not required. If sonication is not performed, proceed to step 4.10.\n\t\nTo sonicate, submerge tubes in wet ice and gently apply the tip of the sonic dismembrator to the outside of the microcentrifuge tube. Sonicate for 40 s at 20 kHz.\nProceed to Western blot following established protocols.\n5. Fixing and Staining Prostate Organoids for Immunohistochemical Analysis by Whole-mount Confocal Microscopy\nCollecting prostate organoids from 24-well plates — TIMING: 45-60 min\nNOTE: When collecting prostate organoids to process for confocal microscopy, it is critical to handle them with care in order to maintain their structure. The collection protocol below is designed to reduce disruption of organoid structure during isolation.\n\t\nRemove the media from each well as in step 3.1.\nDigest the matrix gel by incubating with 500 µL of dispase-containing media (Table 1) for 30 min in a 37 °C 5% CO2 incubator.\nCollect digested organoid suspension in a microcentrifuge tube and pellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT. Remove the supernatant.\nWhole-mount immunofluorescent staining of prostate organoids — TIMING: 3-4 days (1-5 h/day)\nAdd 500 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and incubate for 2 h at RT with gentle shaking.",
    "Pellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT, remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of PBS for 15 min with gentle shaking.\nWash the pellet as in step 5.2.2 for additional two times.\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT and remove the supernatant. Add 1 µg/mL DAPI in blocking solution (Table 1). Incubate for 2 h at RT or alternatively overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking.\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT and remove the supernatant. Add primary antibody (rabbit anti-p63, mouse anti-cytokeratin 8) in blocking solution and incubate overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking.\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT and remove the supernatant. Wash the pellet with 1 mL of PBS for 15 min with gentle shaking.\nWash the pellet as in step 5.2.6 for additional two times.\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT and remove the supernatant. Add secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 594, goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488) in blocking solution and incubate overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking.\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT, remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of PBS for 15 min with gentle shaking.\nWash the pellet as in step 5.2.9 for additional two times.\n6. Tissue Clearing and Mounting of the Stained Prostate Organoids for Whole-mount Confocal Microscopy — TIMING: 7 H\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT and remove the supernatant.",
    "Add 1 mL of 30% sucrose in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and incubate for 2 h at RT with gentle shaking.\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of 45% sucrose in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and incubate for 2 h at RT with gentle shaking.\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 1 mL of 60% sucrose in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and incubate for 2 h at RT with gentle shaking.\nPellet the organoids by centrifugation at 800 x g for 3 min at RT and remove 95% of the supernatant.\nNOTE: The pellet becomes looser as the concentration of sucrose becomes higher. Observing the DAPI-stained organoids under the UV light to confirm that they were not lost during removal of the supernatant is recommended.\nTransfer a 10-20 µL droplet of the remaining suspension to a chambered coverslip and proceed to confocal microscopy.\nNOTE: Coverslip fragments can be placed on either side of the droplet to be used as spacers (Figure 4C). These prevent organoids from collapsing when a coverslip is placed over the droplet."
