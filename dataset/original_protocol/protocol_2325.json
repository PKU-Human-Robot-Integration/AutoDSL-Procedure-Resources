    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1: Library construction & amplification\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis part generates the customized dual-gRNA screening library that contains 2 promoters (hU6 and mU6), 2 gRNAs, and 2 scaffolds of different versions within one vector. Briefly, the amplified gRNA pool inserts and digested vectors were ligated via their compatible ends.\nNote: Refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] for reducing recombination and troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] to improve efficiency.\n(Day 1) Oligo pool amplification: assemble two PCR reactions for amplifying two gRNA pools separately on ice using corresponding primers, then follow the cycling conditions for each PCR reaction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_8.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_9.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_10.csv\nAfter PCR amplification, run out the reaction on an EZ-VISION Blue-Light DNA Dye-stained 1% agarose gel. Visualize and cut the DNA fragment at ∼90 bp, then extract DNA using the QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, elute in 20 μL ddH2O.\nCritical: Elute the amplified gRNA and digested vector in ddH2O to avoid introduction of the excess salt, which might influence the electroporation in later step.\nNote: A guide line about the agarose gel concentration selection and optimization could be found at https://www.qiagen.com/us/knowledge-and-support/knowledge-hub/bench-guide/dna/analysing-dna/dna-analysis-using-analytical-gels[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/knowledge-and-support/knowledge-hub/bench-guide/dna/analysing-dna/dna-analysis-using-analytical-gels].\n(Day 1–2) Insert first set of gRNAs. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nVector linearization (could be done in parallel to step 1): assemble the following reaction on ice and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_11.csv\nThen run out the sample on an EZ-VISION Blue-Light DNA Dye -stained 1% agarose gel. Extract linearized vector using QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit, elute with 30 μL ddH2O.",
    "HiFi assembling: the molar ratio between the fragments of linearized vector: insertion (gRNA pools) is optimized to 1:100 with 100 ng of linearized vector. NEBioCacμlator helps to convert dsDNA mass to moles of dsDNA (or vice versa): https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/#!/dsdnaamt[href=https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/]. Assemble the reaction on ice, incubate at 50°C for 60 min (use thermocycler), then proceed to transformation (step 1c) directly.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_12.csv\n(Afternoon) Transformation by electroporation:\nCalculate the number of reactions needed based on the library size and coverage. For example, we usually get around 25,000–30, 000 colonies per reaction. For a gRNA pool with 250 gRNA, 1–2 electroporation reactions are required to reach at least 100 coverages (250∗100 = 25,000) for each gRNA.\nPrepare MicroPulser Cuvettes (2 mm) on ice for at least 10 min. Set up the electroporator with conditions of voltage 3,000 V, Capacitance 25 μF, resistance 200 Ω, cuvette 2 mm.\nThaw Endura Electrocompetent cells on ice for 15 min.\nFor each reaction: add 1 μL of the HiFi reaction product to Endura Electrocompetent cells, mix them gently. Then transfer the mixture into MicroPulser Cuvettes, electroporate at the setting listed in step ii, add 975 of Recovery Medium ASAP.\nCritical: Use fresh HiFi product for the transformation each time.\nCritical: Quickly adding the Recovery Medium into the cuvette ASAP after electroporation is one key step. The electroporation efficiency will dramatically decrease if this step is delayed.\nNote: One trial run is suggested to test how many colonies can grow for each transformation reaction. Then calculate the coverage and corresponding number of reactions needed.\nTransfer cells mixture to a bacterial culture tube with additional 1 mL recovery medium (or SOC medium). Shake the tubes for 1 h at 37°C in a shaking incubator.",
    "Titer the library: Set up dilutions for counting colonies: set up serial dilution (1:10, 1:100, 1: 1000,…) of the culture and plate onto 10 cm ampicillin LB agar plate. Count the colonies next morning to calculate the library coverage. The diluted plate is used to calculate the total colony number to ensure library coverage.\nPlate the library: Spread the original culture onto pre-warmed 15 cm ampicillin LB agar plate (0.5 mL/plate), incubate at 30°C for approximate 18 h.\nCritical: 30°C incubation is intended to minimize recombination of the lentiviral plasmid library.\nHarvest colonies and maxi-prep: Transfer 6 mL of LB+ ampicillin medium on one 15 cm plate, scrape the colonies off with a cell spreader. Then use another 6 mL of LB+ ampicillin medium to wash the plate. Collect all colonies and proceed to max-prep according to QIAGEN Plasmid Kit procedures.\nOptional: Sanger Sequencing. To ensure the success of gRNA pool’s insertion, pick several colonies from the plate (2d or 2e) to 4 mL LB culture with ampicillin. Shake the tubes for at least 8 h at 37°C. Use QIAGEN Mini Prep Kit to extract the plasmid and send it to Sanger Sequencing with primer of PCR1_F.\n(Day 2–3) Insert second set of gRNAs: The process is similar to step 2 of inserting first set of gRNA pools. The only difference is the enzyme digestion setting.\nVector linearization: assemble the following reaction on ice and incubate at 55°C for 1 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_13.csv\nThen run out the sample on an EZ-VISION Blue-Light DNA Dye -stained 1% agarose gel. Extract linearized DNA using QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit, elute with 30 μL ddH2O. PCR purification kit could be used on the enzyme digestion product to save time.",
    "Repeat HiFi assembling as steps 2b to 2f. Harvest colonies and max prep are the same as step2.\nNote: Step 3 usually requires much more reactions to reach appropriate library coverage, considering the combination of 2 sgRNAs. For example, for two sets of gRNA pools with 250 different gRNAs, there will be 62,500 combinations. To reach 10 coverages for each gRNA-gRNA construction, 20 electroporate reactions (62500∗10/30,000) are needed.\nLibrary QC: Directly proceed to steps 20–24 and data analysis part. Sequencing the whole library at least 50× coverage (refer to step 23 for how to choose sequencing service) for the QC purpose. Pay attention to mapping ratio, number/percentage of missed gRNA pairs, the distribution and evenness of the gRNA-gRNA constructions.\nLibrary amplification: depending on the experiment designs, such as cell coverage and number of replicates, the amount of library generated from steps 1–3 might be insufficient. In this case, amplify the pooled library by electroporation as described in steps 2c–2e. Instead of using 1 μL of HiFi reaction product, dilute the pooled library to 50 ng/μL and then use 2 μL 50 ng/μL pooled library for each reaction.\nPart 2: Large scale lentivirus production\nTiming: 5 days\nThis part generates lentivirus that will be used to integrate dual-gRNA cassette into cellular genome during the screening steps. In this protocol we transfected 293T cells with psPAX2, pMD2.G and the dual-gRNA plasmid library for lentiviral production. psPAX2 and pMD2.G are the second generation lentiviral packaging plasmid and VSV-G envelope expressing plasmid, respectively.\nCritical: Biosafety precautions: Double gloves should be worn, and all virus waste requires incubation in 20% bleach for 30 min before disposal. No vacuum pumps can be used.",
    "Day 1. Seed 8–9 × 106/15 cm plate 293T packaging cells (recommended: passage number < 15) in 20 mL none-antibiotic growth media. For 1 L virus production prepare ∼60 plates. Incubate cells for 24 h (37°C, 5% CO2), or until the following afternoon. The cells should be ∼70% confluent at the moment of transfection.\nDay 2 afternoon. Transfect 293T cells:\nPrepare the mixture of 3 transfection plasmid (∼1:1:1 molar ratio) in OptiMEM:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_14.csv\nFor each plate, prepare one 1× OptiMEM and X-tremeGENE transfection reagent (i.e., 60 tubes OptiMEM and X-tremeGENE mix will be needed for 60 plates): directly add 48 μL X-tremeGENE into the tubes with 600 μL OptiMEM, and gently mix them by flicking the tubes.\nCritical: Do not mix by pipetting or vertex here.\nAfter the incubation, add 200 μL OptiMEM with transfection plasmids drop-wise to each tube with OptiMEM and X-tremeGENE dilutions (1:3 ratio), then mix gently.\nCarefully transfer the transfection mix to 293T packaging cells by drop-wise adding in circular motion.\nIncubate cells for 18 h (37°C, 5% CO2).\nDay 3 morning. Replace the media containing transfection components with high-BSA growth media for viral production (∼20 mL/15 cm plate).\nDay 4 morning. Harvest media containing lentivirus at ∼40 h post-transfection. Transfer media to 50 mL plastic tube. Spin the media containing lentivirus at 180 × g for 3 min, then collect and aliquot the supernatant into 15/50 mL sterile polypropylene storage tube. Lentivirus should be frozen at −80°C for long-term storage but can be stored temporarily at 4°C for hrs to days.\nNote: Aliquot the lentivirus to smaller tubes according to the following steps’ usage to avoid freeze/thaw cycles.",
    "Optional: After harvesting the lentivirus at day 4 morning, add high-BSA growth media again for continuing viral production. Then harvest lentivirus at day 5 morning. Note that the lentivirus amount might drop a lot compared to day-4 batch.\nPart 3: Multiplicity of infection (MOI) determine\nTiming: 5–8 days\nThis part tests the titer of lentivirus produced from Part 2 and determine the volume of virus needed to reach the MOI ∼0.3 in the lentivirus transduction of the pooled library in Part 4.\nCritical: The MOI of lentivirus must be determined for each batch and under the exact same cell culture conditions, such as media and cell density, used in the screening. Measurements from different conditions cannot be scaled to determine the MOI.\nCritical: Biosafety precautions for virus waste. In our institution, all virus waste requires incubation in 20% bleach for 30 min before disposal. No vacuum pumps can be used.\nNote: To test MOI, two sets of samples with lentivirus infection are needed. The MOI can be calculated by measuring the ratio of living cells number in the lentivirus + antibiotics group over living cell number in the lentivirus only (no antibiotics selection, 100% survival control) group. Besides the samples with virus, another set of sample without virus but selected by antibiotics is needed for negative control purpose (0% survival control).\nNote: The cells are transduced at a concentrated seeding density in 12-well plates while centrifuging (‘spinfection’), to achieve higher transduction efficiency. For normal transduction without spinning, refer to Hart et al. (Hart et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). If the cells can reach MOI ∼0.3 with sensible volume of lentivirus (<50% medium), normal transduction would be an easier option.",
    "Note: The ideal spinfection conditions can be highly variable across cell type and should be optimized. A detailed protocol for the optimization of lentiviral transduction spinfection can be found at https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/dir/download?dirpath=protocols/production&filename=Optimization_of_Lentiviral_Spinfection_Oct2018.pdf[href=https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/dir/download?dirpath=protocols/production&filename=Optimization_of_Lentiviral_Spinfection_Oct2018.pdf].\nNote: The antibiotics selection time may vary from 2 to 5 days.\nDay 1. Lentivirus spinfection.\nThaw a fresh aliquot of pooled lentivirus on ice.\nHarvest cells for spinfection test and measure the number of cells/mL. Suspend the cells in small volume of median since spinfection requires concentrated seeding density.\nDesign dilution series of virus for MOI determination between 0–1 mL (e.g., 0.1 mL, 0.2 mL, 0.5 mL). For each dilution series, prepare two sets (one for testing MOI, one for positive control). Add 1 mL of cell suspension and 1 mL of media/polybrene/lentivirus solution to the corresponding labeled wells (total 2 mL each well). Prepare another one set of samples without lentivirus for negative control purpose (i.e., one set of 6 × 10ˆ6 SaOS2 in 8 mL media/polybrene solution ready for 4 wells).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_15.csv\nCentrifuge the plate: spin the plates at 930 × g for 1.5 h at 30°C.\nAfter 1.5 h spinning, add 2 mL of media without polybrene dropwise on top of each well.\nIncubate cells for 24 h (37°C, 5% CO2).\nDay 2. Transfer the cells into 15 cm plate and start antibiotics selection:\nInspect cells visually, take note of the following things: cell conditions, the confluence of the wells, how adhered the cells are, approximate number of dead cells.\nCollect the cells from the 6-well plate.\nRemove the median, gently wash the cells with 1 mL pre-warmed PBS.\nAdd 250 μL of trypsin each well and let the cells detach from the plate.\nAdd 750 μL of media to each well and transfer the cell suspension to corresponding labeled tubes.",
    "Spin down and then re-suspend the cells.\nReseed the cells to 15 cm plate (4 corresponding wells for one 15 cm plate for SaOS2) with either media containing puromycin at required concentration (2.5 μL/mL for SaOS2) or media without puromycin. Add media containing puromycin to the negative control (cells + polybrene, no virus) set.\nNote: If your incubator is not level, you can let plates sit level in hood for up to 1 h.\nDay 4. MOI determination.\nAfter 48 h, all uninfected cells should be dead. There should be no living cells in the negative control group.\nRemove media, gently wash the cells with pre-warmed PBS to remove all the remaining dead cells. Trypsinize and collect cells from each plate into 15 mL tubes.\nCount the cells from all plates and two settings of with or without puromycin selection.\nDetermine the lentivirus volume that yields to ∼30% survival with puromycin selection vs. without puromycin selection, which gives MOI ∼0.3 and ensure each cell is infected by no more than one virus.\nPart 4: Screening with customized library pool\nTiming: 3–5 weeks\nPart 4 performs pooled combinatorial CRISPR screen in human cells. The initial- and end- time point samples were harvested.\nCritical: Carefully consider the number of replicates and coverage you are going to use. Based on the previous MOI testing, cell coverage and replicate number, calculate the total number of cells, number of plates, and corresponding lentivirus volume (refer to step 13b).\nCritical: Biosafety precautions for virus waste (steps 12 and 13). In our institution, all virus waste requires incubation in 20% bleach for 30 min before disposal. No vacuum pumps can be used.\nNote: Please refer to troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] to address the low infection efficiency issue.",
    "Note: 1.25 × 10ˆ7 cells give ∼200-fold representation for each gRNA-gRNA construct in the 62,500 pool. If desired, you may use higher representation. In the previous combinatorial CRISPR screen, 80-fold is the minimum coverage ((Zhao et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26])).\nNote: Previous CRISPR/Cas9 screens have shown high genomic modification efficiencies after 6–12 days post-expression of Cas9 and gRNA. However, this genomic modification efficiency might be varied due to variations among gRNA performance and cell types. To confirm the ability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit genes in specified cell lines, surveyor assay can be used (Wong et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). Nevertheless, the culture time for CRISPR/Cas9 screen post antibiotics selection typically ranges from 10 to 30 days (refer to Table1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nNote: A transient slowing of cell growth may be noticed. The cells should be able to return to grow normally after 5–15 days after infection, depending on the cell lines.\nNote: Collect more cells if possible, considering the material loss during downstream processes such as DNA extraction.\nDay 1. Spinfection. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nThe following extra plates with same cell number each plate are needed for negative and positive control purpose: one negative control plate: no virus + puromycin (0% survival control); one positive control plate: virus + no puromycin (100% survival control).\nCalculate the plate number and total number of cells plated for infection with MOI ∼0.3. As discussed in Preparation4, for the SaOS2-Cas9 with triplicate at each time point, at least 2.5 × 10ˆ8 cells are needed at the time of infection, which requires ∼30 6-wheel plates for spinfection.\nThaw pooled lentivirus on ice.\nHarvest cells for spinfection with corresponding virus volume to achieve ∼0.3 MOI. Follow the spinfection process as step 9.\nDay 2. Transfer the cells into 15 cm plate and start antibiotics selection: same as step 10.",
    "Day 4. T0 sample collection and MOI checking.\nAfter 48 h, all uninfected cells should be dead. There should be no living cells in the negative control group.\nRemove media, gently wash the cells with pre-warmed PBS to remove all the remaining dead cells. Trypsinize and collect cells from each plate into 15 mL tubes.\nCount the cells from all plates and two settings of with or without puromycin selection. Ensure the MOI in the formal run is around ∼0.3.\nCollect T0 sample: collect 3 replicates of 1.25 × 10ˆ7 cells by centrifuge (500 × g for 5 min). Wash the T0 samples with PBS and centrifuge again. Label the tube and freeze the cell pellets at −80°C.\nRe-seed the rest of cells into three replicate groups. Ensure each replicate contains at least in total 1.25 × 10ˆ7 cells to maintain the 200 cell coverage. Do NOT use puromycin in this or subsequent plating steps.\nOnward. (T1, T2, …, end point): The pool-infected cells should be cultured and passaged as the same way that you normally use. Each instance that you passage the cells out to the endpoint, ensure at least 1.5 × 10ˆ7 cells in total for each replicate group.\nNote: Monitor the cell growth carefully, you may need to consider harvesting the Tend sample earlier if cells started dying fast.\nEnd time point. Collect Tend samples as step 14d.\nPart 5: Genomic DNA extraction and PCR\nTiming: 3–5 days\nPart 5 performs two rounds of PCR after genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction. PCR1 enriches dual-gRNA cassette regions from the whole genome. PCR2 adds Illumina adapters and sample indices to the amplified dual-gRNA to facilitate Illumina sequencing in part 6.",
    "Note: IDT UltramerTM DNA oligonucleotide is suggested for the long PCR2 primers (with adapter to flow cell, sample index, sequencing primer), which is more expensive than PCR1 primers. Thus two-step PCR is performed to reduce cost as well as PCR-induced error.\nNote: Assuming a diploid genome is around 6.5 pg and one dual-gRNA construction per genome, 80 μg (62,500∗200∗6.5pg) of genomic DNA yields ∼200-fold coverage of a library with size of 62,500. Note that the average 6.5 pg genome weight might not fit every cell line.\nNote: Please refer to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] for PCR failure.\ngDNA Extraction: extract gDNA following the protocol of JetQuick Blood and Cell Culture DNA Maxiprep Kit.\nPrecipitate and purify gDNA, and then quantify gDNA using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay.\nPCR1 (extract and enrich gRNA regions from the genome): add 2.5 μg of gDNA per 50 μL reaction. Set up identical 50 μL reactions to achieve the desired coverage.\nNote: Use the lowest amount of the gDNA among all samples to calculation the number of PCR1 reaction for each sample. For example, if 80 μg is the lowest yield from all gDNA samples, then set up 32 PCR1 reactions for all samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_16.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_17.csv\nPool all individual 50 μL PRC1 reaction products, mix by vertex. Then directly proceed to PCR2.\nOptional: Run 2 μL of PCR1 product on 1% gel. Visualize the PCR product on a gel imager. PCR1 yields a product of ∼1,300 bp.\nPCR2 (amplify gRNA with Illumina TruSeq adapters with i5/i7 indices and barcodes):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_18.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1933_19.csv\nGel extraction and QC:",
    "After PCR amplification, run out the reaction on an EZ-VISION Blue-Light DNA Dye-stained 1% agarose gel. Visualize and cut the DNA fragment at ∼580 bp, then extract DNA using the QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, elute in 20 μL ddH2O.\nQuantify the fragment concentration using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay.\nRun the sample in TapeStation DNA1000 or Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip for QC check.\nPart 6: Sequencing\nTiming: depending on the sequencing core\nPart 6 provides a guideline for selecting the sequencing service.\nNote: Please refer to troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9] for addressing the low diversity issue.\nChoose appropriate sequencing service.\nCalculate the total reads: the total reads needed can be calculated as: coverages∗library size∗number of samples / mapping ratio. For example, to reach 200 coverage for a library with 62.5k different gRNA-gRNA constructions with triplicate in the screening (T0 and Tend in triplicates, 6 samples in total), ∼ 9.5 × 10ˆ7 reads (200∗62,500∗6/0.8) will be needed. Ideally the mapping ratio should be greater than 0.8, this number can be reduced in read estimation if you were not confident about the library quality.\nStandard Pair-End (PE) sequencing with dual-index is required to sequence the two gRNAs on the both ends of the DNA fragment. At least 2 × 50 bp read cycle is suggested to cover the 20-bp gRNA sequence at both ends of the DNA fragment.\nGiven the total reads and PE sequencing, you may choose the sequencing service. The library samples can be sequenced on NovaSeq, NextSeq and MiSeq, which we have all used previously."
