  "procedures": [
    "Mice were housed in accordance with University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA) animal care guidelines in specific pathogen-free conditions with 12 h light-dark cycles and free access to standard feed and water. All animal experiments were approved and conducted in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Animal Research and Care Committee at the University of Pittsburgh.\n1. Surgical Field and Instrument Setup\nSterilize all surgical instruments, suture, gauze, cotton tip applicators, tubing, and tubing connectors prior to the procedure.\nSterilize surgical instruments, suture, gauze, and cotton tip applicators in an autoclave. Sterilize tubing and tubing connectors with ethylene oxide.\nSurgical field\nTurn on a water-circulating heating pad and set to 37 °C. Place a surgical blue pad on top of it and then a sterile drape on top of the surgical blue pad.\nOpen all sterilized instruments onto the sterile drape. Use sterile gloves to avoid breaking sterility during this step.\nFill a stainless steel bowl with 70% ethanol and set aside. This will be used to clean instruments between animals.\nTurn on microbead sterilizer and allow to heat to 150 °C. This will also be used to clean instruments between animals. If performing surgery on more than 5 mice, be sure to change instruments to a new sterile set.\nTransducer Set-up\nConnect a sterile transducer, PE-50 tubing, two 23G needles, and male-male luer, and a three-way stopcock.6\nCalibrate and zero the transducer per manufacturer instructions.\n2. Liver Laceration Surgical Procedure\nAnesthesia Induction and Positioning",
    "Inject sodium pentobarbital intraperitoneally at dose of 70 mg/kg. Anesthesia should take effect between 5-10 min; assess depth of anesthesia with a toe pinch. If the mouse has response to the toe pinch, additional time or anesthesia is needed. If additional anesthesia is needed during the procedure, supplement sodium pentobarbital. Do not give supplements in larger quantities than 0.05 mL to prevent overdose.\nAfter the mouse is completely under anesthesia, position the mouse supine on a surgical board. Secure all four limbs of the mouse to the board with tape.\nShave the abdomen and bilateral groins with a razor.\nSoak sterile gauze with betadine and apply to the abdomen and bilateral groins for surgery. For survival experiments, prep the abdomen and groins with betadine followed by ethanol for a total of three prep cycles.\nInsert a rectal temperature probe to monitor core temperature throughout the procedure. Keep the core temperature between 35-37 °C.\nFemoral artery and venous cannulation\nFor venous catheter set-up: fill PE-10 tubing, a 30 G needle, and a three-way stopcock with Lactated Ringer's solution from an IV bag.\nFor arterial catheter set-up: fill PE-10 tubing and 30G needle with heparinized saline (1:10 dilution of 1,000 U heparin). Heparin-saline is required to prevent clotting.\nPlace the mouse under a dissecting microscope.\nMake a 4-5 mm longitudinal incision over the groin muscle using surgical Iris scissors. Using Dumont forceps grab the adipose tissue connected to the adductor muscle and pull laterally for a clean exposure of the femoral bundle. Do not dissect through the adipose tissue as this will lead to vascular injury.",
    "Carefully dissect the nerve away from the artery and vein with the Dumont forceps. There is a fat pad adjacent to the nerve. Grab this with one Dumont forcep and pull laterally; this pulls the nerve away from the artery creating a plane for dissection. With other Dumont forcep bluntly dissect the connective tissue between the nerve and the artery.\n\t\t\nDo not grab the nerve during this part of the dissection.\nLoop three 6-0 silk sutures around the artery and vein proximal to the profunda femoris take off.\n\t\t\nPlace suture 1 most proximally and leave loose.\nPlace suture 2 most distally and tie immediately.\nPlace suture 3 between Suture 1 and 2 and leave loose.\nMake an arteriotomy on the ventral surface of the vessel. Use of microvascular scissors is recommended to make the arteriotomy to avoid transection of the vessel.\nInsert the three-way catheter into the artery. Immediately tie off Suture 1 and 2 to secure the catheter in place.\nConnect the three-way catheter to the transducer and collect baseline blood pressure data.\nRepeat steps 2.2.4 - 2.2.6 on the opposite groin. Cannulate the femoral vein in a similar manner to the artery. Perform a venotomy on the ventral surface of the vessel followed by catheter insertion. This catheter can be utilized for fluid or drug administration.\nLiver Laceration\nPre-weigh a tube containing 0.5 mL of PBS, three absorption triangles, and one weigh boat per mouse.\nMake a ventral midline laparotomy incision starting at the xiphoid process and extending caudally to allow exposure of the liver completely.\nInsert one absorption triangle in the abdomen against the right abdominal wall. Repeat on the left side.\n\t\t\nMake sure the absorption triangle is away from the liver to avoid a packing hemostatic effect after the liver is lacerated.",
    "Carefully grab the left-middle lobe of the liver and lacerate 75% of the lobe with surgical Iris scissors. Place the lacerated segment in a tube containing PBS.\nClose the abdominal wall with staples via a staple applicator. Grasp the skin and muscle together and fire the staple. Do this as quickly as possible after the liver laceration to avoid blood loss outside of the abdomen. In survival experiments, the abdomen is closed in two layers. A running absorbable suture for the muscle followed by a running layer of non-absorbable suture for the skin provides adequate closure.\nFor mice that are for survival timepoints longer than 30 min the femoral catheters should be removed, the artery and vein tied with suture 3 from step 2.2.6. Bilateral groins are then closed in two layers as described in the previous step.\nFollowing a specified time of interest for hemorrhage (30 min up to 72 h), remove the staples. Remove the absorption triangles and put into corresponding pre-weighed weigh boats. Use additional absorption triangles to soak up any unabsorbed blood.\nWeigh absorption filters to calculate total blood loss.\nPost-operative Care\nLeave mice that are to be sacrificed at 30 min on the surgical board and under constant monitoring and under full anesthesia until the time of sacrifice. Mice are euthanized with a combination of cardiac puncture and an overdose of inhaled isoflurane.\nPlace mice that are for longer survival time points in a recovery cage on top of a water-circulating heating pad. Constantly monitor the mice during recovery and do not leave unattended until they regain consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Return the mouse to cage space with other mice only once it has recovered from anesthesia.",
    "Administer post-operative analgesia with 0.1 mg/kg buprenex via subcutaneous injection once awoken from anesthesia and every 12 h after until the time of sacrifice.\nAllow mice free access to food and water after they are returned to their normal cages post-operatively.\nAt the time of sacrifice for survival mice, anesthesia is accomplished with inhaled isoflurane. Once under anesthesia blood is collected via a right heart cardiac puncture, blood loss is recorded as described above and finally euthanasia is insured with an overdose of isoflurane.\nSubscription Required.
