    "Animal studies were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of McGill University and procedures were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of McGill University (animal use protocol # 2009-5754).\n1. Generation of CA2Cre-shp53 Lentiviral Titre\nNOTE: The following protocol is the same as that described in Xia et al.6, with minor modifications.\nPreparation of lentivirus (for 15 cm x 10 cm dishes)\n\t\nOn day 1, plate healthy HEK293T cells (7.5 x 106 cells per 10 cm dish) with 10 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium) (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% pen/strep. Culture in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nPrepare the mix for calcium-phosphate transfection (mixture for 15 plates). Prepare tube A containing 225 µg (15 µg/plate) of the lentiviral vector (Ca2Cre-shp53), 75 µg (5 µg/plate) of PsPAX2 plasmid (containing HIV-1 gag and HIV-1 pol genes), 75 µg (5 µg/plate) of pMD2.G plasmid (containing VSV-G gene) for packaging, a final concentration of 0.15 M of CaCl2 and fill the tube with distilled H2O up to 3.75 mL. Prepare tube B containing 3.75 mL of 2x HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.05, 280 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4·2H2O, and 12 mM D-dextrose).\nVortex tube A and add it dropwise to tube B under continuous vortexing.\n\t\tNOTE: The total volume will be 7.5 mL.\nIncubate at room temperature in the dark for 20−30 min.\nApproximately 9 h after plating the cells, add 500 µL of the transfection mixture dropwise into the cell medium (7.5 mL/15 dishes: 0.5 mL per dish).\nSwirl gently each dish to mix, and incubate all dishes at 37 °C, 5% CO2.",
    "On day 2, 12−18 h after transfection, replace the media with 10 mL of antibiotic-free reduced serum media (Table of Materials) per 10 cm dish. Place dishes back in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nOn day 3, collect the media containing lentiviruses expressing Ca2Cre-shp53 and filter through 0.45 μm filters. Replenish the media with fresh antibiotic-free reduced serum media.\n\t\tNOTE: The collected media can be kept at 4 °C for no more than 3 days.\nOn day 4, collect, for a second time, the media containing the lentivirus and filter through a 0.45 µm filter. Keep at 4 °C (for no more than 3 days).\nCombine the virus supernatants from steps 1.1.8 and 1.1.9. Concentrate them through centrifugal filter units (Table of Materials) by centrifuging at 1,372 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Repeat the process until all the collected media has passed through the columns.\n\t\tNOTE: After each centrifugation, 100−200 μL of concentrated filtrate can be harvested.\nCollect and mix the concentrated filtrates in a 15 mL ice-cold tube. Mix the concentrated lentiviruses well and then aliquot (e.g., 100 μL/ tube). Store at -80 °C.\nLentiviral titration\n\tNOTE: Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing a loxP-flanked allele of green fluorescent protein (GFP) are used in this protocol for the quantification of viral titer. However, any cell line with a loxP-GFP allele should be suitable for this step.\n\t\nCulture cells expressing a loxP-flanked allele of GFP with DMEM, 10% FBS and 1% pen/strep at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nPlate 2 x 105 cells in two 50 mm wells of a 6-well plate.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells of one well will be used for lentiviral infection while that of the other will be used as a negative control.",
    "The next day, replenish the cells with 2 mL of DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% pen/strep 2 h before lentiviral infection.\nAdd 20 µL of the CA2Cre-shp53 lentivirus (the volume may vary when needed) in the lentiviral infection well.\nAfter 3 days in culture, determine the frequency of the Cre-induced GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry, as shown in Figure 1. Wash cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), detach by trypsinization and collect cells by centrifugation at 112 x g.\nWash the cells twice with PBS. Finally, suspend the cells in 100 µL of PBS. Determine the percentage of GFP positive cells by a cell analyzer (Table of Materials).\nCalculate the lentivirus infectious/functional titer using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60565/60565equ01.jpg\n\t\twhere F is the frequency of GFP-positive cells and calculated by subtracting the frequency of GFP -positive cells after infection (Fi) from the frequency of GFP-positive cells (background) prior to infection (Fc) as shown in Figure 1 (F = Fi-Fc), Cn is the number of plated cells (2 x 105), V is the volume of the inoculum (mL), and DF is the virus dilution factor.\n\t\tNOTE: The infectious/functional concentration = ~2 x 106 TU/mL.\n2. Intratracheal Intubation of Lentiviruses in LSL-KRASG12D Mice\nNOTE: The method of intratracheal intubation was used as described in the published protocol by Vandivort et al.9. In this protocol, mice LSL-KRASG12D mice in C57BL/6 background are used at age 6−8 weeks. A home-made working procedure board is used as described in Vandivort et al.9. The board is positioned in front of the experimenter in a convenient workspace (approximately 1 m2).\nPrepare a spirometer by removing the plunger of a 1 mL syringe and loading 60 µL of PBS into the syringe.\nAttach a 22 G catheter tip into the syringe and set aside.",
    "Anaesthetize the mice by intraperitoneal injection of a 1 µL/g of mouse body weight of ketamine (50 mg/mL)/xylazine (5 mg/mL)/acepromazine (1 mg/mL) cocktail. Ensure proper sedation of the mouse by a low respiratory rate (1 breath every 2 s).\nAspirate 20 µL of CA2Cre-shp53 lentivirus into a pipettor and set aside.\nPosition the sedated mouse on the working procedure board by hooking its upper incisors into the thread of the board.\n\tNOTE: The mouse's dorsum should be flat against the platform.\nTape the caudal portion of the thoracic cavity to the platform to ensure alignment of the mouse during the procedure.\nAdjust a gooseneck illuminator between 80−100% intensity and place the light 1−2 cm from the skin surface.\nFrom behind the platform, draw the tongue out of the oral cavity of the mouse using sterile forceps.\nWhile securing the tongue, insert a depressor into the oral cavity of the mouse then release the tongue.\nPosition the gooseneck on the main stem bronchi to illuminate trachea.\n\tNOTE: The trachea may be visible through the action of respiration, causing fluctuation of the light.\nWhen the trachea is clearly viewed, insert the spirometer prepared (syringe with PBS and catheter) into the tracheal path.\nRemove the depressor and observe the rise and fall of PBS in the syringe with each breath.\n\tNOTE: This is an indicator that the catheter is properly positioned into the trachea.\nRemove the syringe containing PBS while maintaining the catheter inside the trachea as the previous position.\nDeposit the 20 µL CA2Cre-shp53 lentivirus into the center of the catheter.\nWhile keeping the catheter in place, inject 300 µL of air into the catheter using an empty syringe to ensure proper distribution of lentivirus in the lungs.\nKeep the catheter in place and reinsert the spirometer into the catheter.",
    "NOTE: The rise and fall of the PBS bubble will ensure that the procedure is successful.\nRemove the catheter and tape. Place the animal in a warm and dry place until it is revived.\n3. Ultrasound Imaging of Lung Tumors in Mice\nNOTE: Ultrasound imaging was performed after 7 and 18 weeks of lentiviral intubation using the system listed in Table of Materials; however, any model can be used for the analysis.\nOne day prior to imaging, remove fur from the chest area of the intubated mouse.\n\tNOTE: Mouse should be sedated during this step by placing them in an induction chamber of 3% isoflurane and 2L/minute O2.\nOn the day of imaging, set up the workspace as shown in Figure 2. Turn on the heating pump for ultrasound gel and the temperature monitor.\nSet up a warm 33 °C incubator to place the mice in post-imaging.\nPlace the three-dimensional (3D) motor (Figure 2F) on the integrated rail system.\nMake sure that the 3D motor and the transducer mounting system are securely in place.\nConnect a preferred transducer (frequency: 40 MHz; Figure 2E and Table of Materials) for tumor measurements perpendicular to the 3D motor.\nStart a new study on the ultrasound software.\n\t\nSelect Study Browser, then select New at the bottom of the screen.\nSelect New Study, a new window will appear that enables the addition of a Study Name in addition to further information about the study, i.e., date of study, name of researcher, etc.\nFill in the information in Series Name, i.e., Animal ID, Strain, Weight, Date of Birth, etc.\nSelect Done, the program will change for B-mode.\nPut a heating lamp in a convenient position above the animal platform.\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber (3.5% isoflurane).",
    "NOTE: Proper anesthetization is confirmed by unconsciousness of the mouse, and slower respiratory rate of around 1 breath per 2 seconds.\nWhen the mouse is sedated, change the connection of the anesthetic machine to be directed towards the animal platform, reduce isoflurane to 2.5%.\nPlace the mouse on the animal platform in decubitus ventral, with its oral cavity directed towards the anesthetics tube.\nApply lubricant on the eyes of the mouse.\nPlace the mouse in decubitus dorsal and tape its hands and feet firmly onto the animal platform.\nApply a small layer of ultrasound gel on the mouse chest.\nLower the acquisition probe using the height-control knob to touch the surface of the mouse chest. Position the probe such that the heart of the mouse is approximately centered.\nUse the micro-knobs to acquire images of the whole chest, from both extremities, in the transverse orientation ideally gathering 500 frames per mouse (number of frames may vary depending on personal choice).\nOnce imaging is done, remove the gel from the chest of the mouse and place the mouse in the warm incubator.\n4. 2D Analysis of Ultrasound Images\nAfter opening acquired frames on the ultrasound software, scan the frames for tumors.\nFor small initiating tumors, count the number of B-lines periodically every 10 frames for the full length of the 500 frames acquired.\n\tTherefore, B-lines are counted in a total of 50 images, each image is separated by 10 frames. B-lines are characterized by longitudinal white straight lines fully traversing the screen.\nFor 2D measurements of large tumors, select the linear tool and measure the width and length of the tumor present.\nTo calculate the volume of the tumors, use the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60565/60565equ02.jpg\n\twhere L and W are the length and width of the tumor, respectively.",
