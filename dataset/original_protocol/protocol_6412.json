    "S. cerevisiae cellular extracts preparationStreak the S. cerevisiae strains to be analyzed from corresponding glycerol stocks on YD plates (Recipe 1). Incubate for two days at 28 °C.Using a sterile toothpick, select individual colonies.Grow yeast cells at 28 °C under agitation (120 rpm) in 50 ml YD medium to an OD600 of 3 (OD600 = 1 corresponds to a density of 1.25 x 107 cells/ml).Note: From this step, keep your samples on ice as much as possible. Centrifuge the yeast culture in 50 ml Falcon® tubes at 3,500 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 ml ice-cold water.Centrifuge at 16,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 s.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 200 µl ice-cold lysis buffer (Recipe 7).Add 200 µg acid-washed 425-600 µm diameter glass beads to the cell suspension.Perform cell lysis by vortexing 8 x 30 s at 3,000 rpm, with a 15 s break on ice between each vortexing step.Centrifuge at 2,400 x g at 4 °C for 20 s.Transfer the supernatant (cell lysate) in a new Eppendorf tube and store it at -80 °C if not used directly, with prior snap freezing in liquid nitrogen.Protein concentration quantificationNote: This protocol includes protein quantification using the bicinchoninic acid assay. If familiar with any other method for protein concentration quantification like Bradford assay, this can be used as well. Prepare standard solutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) from a 2 mg/ml stock solution according to the Table 1 for establishment of a calibration curve:Table 1. Preparation of the BSA standardsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200303/20200303000134_9214.jpgDilute the cell lysates so that their concentration is covered by the calibration curve.",
    "If starting from a 50 ml culture harvested at an OD600 of 3, samples can be diluted 10 times (10 µl of cell lysate in 90 µl MilliQ water).Mix 49 ml bicinchoninic acid with 1 ml CuSO4·5H2O (4%) (Recipe 8).Mix 20 µl of each standard/sample with 200 µl of the mix bicinchoninic acid/ CuSO4·5H2O.Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Read the absorbance at 562 nm.Determine a calibration curve using the standards and deduce the concentration of the samples to be analyzed using this calibration curve. Figure 1 illustrates a typical linear regression that could be obtained with the BSA standards prepared as described above.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200303/20200303000222_8185.jpgFigure1. Example of calibration curve obtained for the bicinchoninic acid assay from BSA standards prepared as described here. The equation of the linear regression as well as the corresponding R2 are mentioned on the graph.Sod2p activity stainingMix a volume of cell lysate corresponding to 200 µg proteins (about 15 µl if starting from a 50 ml culture harvested at an OD600 of 3) with the same volume of 2x cc. sample buffer for native gels (Recipe 9).Load the resulting mixture on a Mini-PROTEAN® TGXTM precast protein gel.Run the gel for 4 h at 100 V at 4 °C in native gel running buffer (Recipe 10).After gel migration, immerge it in 20 ml of a 1 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium solution for 15 min under agitation (40 rpm) and in the dark.Rince the gel with MilliQ water.Immerge the gel in 25 ml of the staining solution (Recipe 11) for 15 min under agitation (40 rpm) and in the dark.Rince the gel with MilliQ water.Expose to light for 15-30 min and scan the gel. The unstained region of the gel corresponds to Sod2p.",
    "Figure 2 illustrates the gel obtained for the wild-type yeast strain and for the strains deleted for the genes coding for the CuZn-Sod1p (sod1Δ) or for the Mn-Sod2p (sod2Δ).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200303/20200303000249_3608.jpgFigure 2. Activity of Sod2p assessed in-gel for the wild-type, sod1Δ, and sod2Δ yeast strains. The intensity of the white band at the level of the arrow correlates with the level of activity of Sod2p (the whiter this region, the higher the activity of Sod2p)."
