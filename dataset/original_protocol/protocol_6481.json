    "Sample preparationBefore subjecting to UPLC system, permethylated glycan sample should be cleaned up further by ZipTipC18 (described in Yu et al., 2020), and dried by SpeedVac.Re-dissolve the permethylated glycan sample in 10 μl of 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid.Set up the UPLC system parametersConnect the nanoACQUITY UPLC system to an LTQ-Orbitrap EliteTM hybrid mass spectrometer via PicoView nanospray source for nanoLC separation at 35 °C, using a 75 μm ID, 25 cm length C18 BEH column packed with 1.7 μm particles with a 300 Å pore size.Set up the constant flow rate of 300 nl/minSet the solvent system containing 100% water with 0.1% formic acid (FA) for mobile phase A, and 100% acetonitrile with 0.1% FA for mobile phase B. Use a linear gradient of 30-60% of B over the course of 30 min and then increase to 80% acetonitrile over the course of 5 min and hold isocratically for another 10 min (shown in Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200512/20200512005925_4636.jpgFigure 2. Steps in setting up HPLC gradient methodSet up parameters for MS acquisition (shown in Figure 3)Double-click the Xcalibur software and then, click the Instrument Setup.Click “Nth order double play”.Choose “Initialize method with Orbitrap Elite support”, and type “5” in Analyze Top N peaks, then click “OK”. The page named “Thermo Xcalibur Instrument Setup” will be shown.Set up parameters which areAcquire time is set for 60 min and type 3 in the “Scan events” in Segment 1 settings (indicated by blue arrow).Note: The acquisition time can be adjusted when LC gradient is changed or different UPLC system/reverse phase capillary column is used.Click Scan Event 1 (active window shown as yellow background).Scan Description: Analyzer: FTMS; Mass Range: Normal; Resolution: 120,000; Scan Type: Full; Polarity: Negative; Data type: Profile.Scan Ranges: First Mass (m/z) 650; Last Mass (m/z) 2000.",
    "Click Scan Event 2 (active window shown as yellow background). Scan Description: Analyzer: Ion Trap; Mass Range: Normal; Scan type: Normal; Data type: CentroidClick Settings and the window “Data Dependent Settings” will be shown.1)Choose “Dynamic Exclusion”; Click “Enabled”; Type Repeat count: 2; Repeat duration (s): 15; Exclusion list size: 500; Exclusion duration (s): 60; Exclusion mass width, choose “By mass”; Low: 1.5; High: 1.5, Click “OK”.2)Choose “Charge State”; Click “Enable charge state screening” and “Enable monoisotopic precursor selection”; Click “Enabled” and choose “Reject charge state”: “2”, “3”, “4 and up”. Click “OK”.Note: This setting is for mono-sulfated permethylated glycans due to singly charge of mono-sulfated glycans in the negative ion mode. 3)Choose “Current Scan Event”; Type Minimum signal threshold (counts): 5000. Click “OK”.4)Choose “Activation”; Choose Activation type: CID; Default charge state: 2; Isolation width (m/z): 2; Normalized collision energy: 35; Activation Q: 0.25; Activation time (ms): 10. Click “OK”.Click Scan Event 3 (active window shown as yellow background)Scan Description: Analyzer: FTMS; Mass Range: Normal; Resolution: 15,000; Data type: Centroid.Click Settings and the window “Data Dependent Settings” will be shown.1)Choose “Dynamic Exclusion”; Click “Enabled”; Repeat count: 2; Repeat duration (s): 15; Exclusion list size: 500; Exclusion duration (s): 60; Exclusion mass width, choose “By mass”; Low: 1.5; High: 1.5. Click “OK”.2)Choose “Charge State”; Click “Enable charge state screening” and “Enable monoisotopic precursor selection”; Click “Enabled” and choose “Reject charge state”: “2”, “3”, “4 and up”. Click “OK”.Note: This setting is for mono-sulfated permethylated glycans due to singly charge of mono-sulfated glycans in the negative ion mode. 3)Choose “Current Scan Event”; Type Minimum signal threshold (counts): 5000. Click “OK”.4)Choose “Activation”; Choose Activation type: HCD; Default charge state: 2; Isolation width (m/z): 2; Normalized collision energy: 110; Activation time (ms): 0.1. Click “OK”.",
    "Go to Tune plus window, and choose Setup→FT Injection Control or click imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200512/20200512011752_6314.jpg in the Instrument Control toolbar. The window named “Injection Control” will be shown. Choose FT, AGC Target Settings, Type “Full MS”: 1.00e6; SIM: 5.00e4; MSn: 5.00e4; Click “Enable Full Scan Injection Waveforms”. Choose Ion Trap, Full MS: 3.00e4; SIM: 1.00e4; MSn: 1.00e4; Zoom: 3000, Click “OK”. Note: These settings are based on the ones used in published work (Yu et al., 2018). Other settings should be adjusted according to sample type. For example,Scan ranges in the scan event 1 will be changed to 1,000-4,000 for permethylated mono-sulfated N-glycans due to singly charged property. Check the section “Data dependent settings” → “Segment” → “Charge State”, The rejected charge state should be adjusted depends on charge states of glycans. For di-sulfated N- or O-glycans detected in the negative ion mode are normally doubly charged. The rejected charge states should be 1, 3, and 4-and up. One should always optimize and calibrate the LC-MS/MS system accordingly.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200512/20200512010055_3701.jpgFigure 3. Setting up the MS acquisition"
