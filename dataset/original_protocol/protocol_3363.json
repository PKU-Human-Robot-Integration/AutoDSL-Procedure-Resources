    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMetabolic labeling\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nTo allow quantitative comparison of cell proteomes between the two studied conditions, cell populations are expanded in the presence of amino acids containing different stable isotopes until most (≥95%) of their proteins have incorporated them.\nHarvest cells of the two lines being analyzed and split them equally in two tubes.\nPellet cells by centrifugation at 500 g for 3 min.\nResuspend half of the control cell pellet with light SILAC medium, and the other half with heavy SILAC medium. Apply the same procedure for the test cell pellet. This will result in a total of 4 samples (i.e., cL, cH, tL, tH) that correspond to two replicates of the experiment with reciprocal labeling (i.e., cLtH and cHtL).\nAlternatives: It is highly recommended to perform this experiment with reciprocal labelling, i.e. have both control and test cell lines separately labelled with light and heavy isotopes, so that they are mixed in two different samples in which the only difference is the order of labelling. However, for preliminary experiments, and given the cost of amino acids containing heavy isotopes, it is possible to use a single labelling, with faster growing lines (typically control cells) being labelled with heavy medium and the other line with light medium. This way, the heavy medium is more effectively used to label cells, as incorporation goes to higher completion more quickly, and fewer medium exchanges are required.\nPlate the cells in an adequate vessel, such as a 6-well plate or a T75 flask.",
    "Note: The number of cells used to start the labelling depends on their doubling time. For fast growing cells such as HEK 293 or HeLa (doubling time approx. 24 h), it may be convenient to start with low number of cells (e.g. 0.3 × 106) as the population will expand during the labelling procedure according to   N =  N 0   e   t  ln ⁡  ( 2 )   / τ    , where    N 0    is the cells seeded and   τ   the doubling time. If enrichment of a subcellular compartment is required, its proportion should be considered (e.g. if mitochondria are to be isolated and the cell line of interest has a low amount of these, then a larger number of cells are needed). Typically, 12-15 15 cm plates of HEK 293 cells for each labelling condition are sufficient for one experiment with mitochondrial isolation.\nAllow the cell populations to expand in their respective SILAC medium for at least 7 doubling times, refreshing the medium every 2 days.\nCritical: It is crucial that the majority of the cell’s proteins are properly labelled. Since the regular culture medium contain naturally occurring isotopes, which are mostly the light counterparts, the labelling completion becomes an issue only for the populations incubated in the heavy medium. If the appropriate time to achieve >95% labelling has not been established, it is possible to monitor heavy isotope incorporation into cellular proteins by taking a sample while passaging and analyzing the whole cell lysate by mass spectrometry.",
    "Note: It is suggested that the amount of SILAC medium needed is determined before starting the experiment, to make sure there are enough resources available. Strategies to minimize the use of these could involve starting the labeling with a small number of cells and, attending to their doubling time, splitting them throughout labeling to obtain the desired number of cells at the end of this procedure.\nHarvesting and sample mixing\nTiming: 60–90 min\nOnce sufficient (>95%) labeling of cells is achieved, labeled cells are collected and mixed. Mixing of cell suspensions in equal proportions is one of the most crucial steps in the protocol. Refer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for schematic of sample mixing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3128-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematics of sample mixing\nControl (c) and test (t) cells are separately labeled with SILAC media containing amino acids labeled with light (L) and heavy (H) isotopes. It is preferable that all cells are labeled simultaneously, but it is also possible to prepare one half of the full experimental set of cells at a time (i.e., cL and tH, or cH and tL). After expanding the cell populations, they are harvested and total protein quantified in each sample. The volume corresponding to the same amount of total protein in each pair is determined and mixed (i.e., cLtH, or cHtL).\nThe day before cell harvesting, place all required solutions, ultracentrifuge rotors and homogenizer at 4°C overnight.\nOn the day of the experiment, refrigerate the centrifuges and ultracentrifuges.\nHarvest each cell population (cL, cH, tL, tH) into separate tubes.\nAdherent cell lines: detach the monolayer using trypsin or another routine dissociation method.\nSemi-adherent cell lines (e.g., HEK 293): detach the monolayer by pipetting directly on the monolayer.\nSuspension cell lines: centrifuge the suspension.",
    "Retrieve cells from the suspension by centrifugation in a 50 mL conical tubes (500 g, 3–5 min, 4°C).\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in cold PBS, pellet cells, and discard supernatant.\nNote: Remove as much cell culture medium as possible as it contains proteins that may behave as contaminants in later stages of the procedure.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 50 mL conical tubes in 10 mL of cold PBS. Keep on ice.\nSave a small fraction of cells labeled with SILAC heavy medium (i.e., cH, tH) to determine the extent of incorporation of heavy isotopes in cellular proteins.\nResuspend the suspensions of cells labeled in heavy medium and immediately collect 10 μL into new, methanol washed, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nPellet the sample in 1.5 mL tubes by centrifugation in a benchtop centrifuge (500 g, 3 min, 4°C) and carefully discard the supernatant.\nFreeze the cell pellets.\nCritical: It is important to store a small aliquot of heavy samples before sample mixing. These will be analyzed by mass spectrometry and inform on the extent of the isotopic labelling by the SILAC heavy medium. This information can be used to optimize the labelling time. If the labelling is determined to be insufficient, the quantitative comparison between samples cannot be made, as the unlabeled pool of proteins from heavy-labelled cells will be indistinguishable from that originating from light-labelled cells.\nDetermine protein concentration of heavy and light labeled samples.\nResuspend cell suspensions of heavy and light labeled cells and immediately collect 10 μL of each into separate, new microcentrifuge tubes. Keep cell suspension in 50 mL conical tubes on ice.\nPellet samples in microcentrifuge tubes by centrifugation in a benchtop centrifuge (500 g, 3 min, 4°C) and carefully discard the supernatant.",
    "Add 10–20 μL of lysis buffer and mix vigorously by pipetting up-and-down. Avoid foaming.\nCritical: Although it is possible to use most protein quantification assays that provide good results for low concentrations, it is important to use a lysis buffer compatible with the assay. Check the interfering compounds (e.g. detergents, reducing agents) of the assay in advance to choose the adequate lysis buffer composition.\nClarify the lysate by centrifugation in a benchtop centrifuge (15,000 g, 5 min, 4°C).\nCarefully collect the supernatant into a new tube, avoiding transferring pelleted debris or chromatin.\nUsing a protein quantification of choice, determine the total protein concentration for each sample.\nIdentify the sample with the lowest total protein amount for the samples that will make up each mix (i.e., cLtH and cHtL), and determine the volume of the other counterpart that contains the same quantity of total protein.\nMix cell suspensions so that total protein quantities from each pair of control and test cell lines are the same.\nPellet cell mixes by centrifugation in a benchtop centrifuge (500 g, 3 min, 4°C) and carefully discard the supernatant. Keep the pellet on ice.\nCritical: It is important to keep cells on ice and perform all centrifugation steps at 4°C to limit degradation of biomolecules.\nSubcellular fractionation\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis section describes purification of cellular components in order to enrich samples for the macromolecular complex of interest while simultaneously reducing contaminating species. Macromolecular complex refers to a stable, functional multi-component unit of proteins that can also contain non-protein molecules, such as nucleic acids.\nNote: This step can be tailored to the target of the study. Here, we describe the purification of mitochondria by differential centrifugation and a step/discontinuous density gradient.",
    "Note: Solutions used in this and following sections can be stored at 4°C for up to 1 year if protease and RNase inhibitors have not been added. For solutions containing carbohydrates, storage conditions will depend on their sterility.\nWeight the wet cell pellet in 50 mL conical tubes, using an empty tube as reference.\nGently resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of hypotonic buffer per 1 g of wet cell mass, and incubate on ice for 10 min. The hypotonic buffer causes cell swelling hence more efficient lysis upon homogenization (see next step).\nAssemble the Balch homogenizer with a suitable ball bearing (12 μm clearance for HEK 293 cells) and wash the inner chamber with hypotonic buffer using two 2.5 mL syringes.\nCritical: Use a ball bearing with an appropriate clearance in the homogenizer – it must be just slightly smaller than the size of the used cells when in suspension. This may be verified using an optic microscope.\nNote: Make sure there are no air bubbles in the syringes or the inner chamber, as these will make the flow of the cell suspension more difficult.\nHomogenize the cell suspensions.\nPass 2 mL of cell suspension through the homogenizer, 3 times or until cells have been disrupted. Keep the homogenizer on ice at all times.\nNote: The weakest point of the Balch homogenizer is the connection with the syringes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Make sure to wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including goggles, and avoid applying excessive pressure on the plungers.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3128-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The assembly and use of Balch homogenizer\n(A and B) Parts of Balch homogenizer (A) and assembled homogenizer (B). The weakest point of the homogenizer is the connection with the syringes (red circles).",
    "Note: The number of passages required to homogenize cells may require optimization. This would involve looking at the homogenate under a light microscope and proceed with further passages if there are still a considerable number of undisrupted cells in the suspension.\nTransfer the homogenate to a new 50 mL conical tube on ice, and immediately add 1.33 mL of 2.5x MSH.\nCritical: Avoid keeping the homogenate in hypotonic buffer for too long. If possible, before starting homogenization, add the required volume of 2.5x MSH to the pre-chilled tube where the homogenate will be dispensed.\nRepeat the homogenization steps until all suspension has been used.\nWash the homogenization chamber with 2.5x MSH and transfer the collected suspension to the tube containing the homogenate.\nMake the volume of the homogenate to 30 mL with 1x MSH.\nIf processing more samples (e.g., both cLtH and cHtL), disassemble the homogenizer, wash it in water and then 70% ethanol, and re-assemble it.\nRepeat homogenization for the next cell mix.\nAlternatives: The same procedure can be done using a Dounce homogenizer, or other preferred method for cell disruption. The main two points to consider are the efficiency of disruption and the integrity of the cell compartment of interest.\nRemove debris from the homogenate by centrifugation (1,000 g, 20 min, 4°C).\nTransfer the supernatant into a new 50 mL conical tube and keep on ice.\nPellet mitochondria by centrifugation (10,000 g, 20 min, 4°C). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the crude mitochondrial pellet in 1 mL of 1x MSH.\nPrepare the step density gradient to purify mitochondria.\nPipette 4 mL of 1.5 M sucrose buffer in a SW 40 Ti ultracentrifuge tube.\nGently layer 4 mL of 1.0 M sucrose buffer on top.",
    "Gently layer 3 mL of 0.5 M sucrose buffer on top of previous layer.\nLayer the crude mitochondrial suspension on top of the gradient column.\nTop up the tube with 1 mL of 1x MSH.\nBalance the tubes, and ultracentrifuge (85,200 g, 1 h, 4°C).\nLocate mitochondria in the gradient – they should appear as a brownish-red disc between the 1.0 M and 1.5 M sucrose cushions (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3128-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Expected results from purification of mitochondria by step/discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation\nThe photograph on the left was taken after ultracentrifugation finished, and the purified mitochondrial disc is highlighted by a white arrowhead. On the right, a scheme of the tube contents, with the location of the purified mitochondria disc highlighted by a black arrowhead. The tube shown in this figure is a 5 mL SW 60 Ti ultracentrifuge tube.\nRemove the 0.5 M and most of the 1.0 M layers by pipetting.\nCollect the mitochondria by pipetting and transfer them to a 15 mL conical tube.\nResuspend the mitochondrial pellet in 4 volumes of 1x MSH.\nPellet the purified mitochondria by centrifugation (10,000 g, 10 min, 4°C). Discard the supernatant. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nContinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation\nTiming: 3–4 h\nIn this step, macromolecular complexes are separated by ultracentrifugation through a continuous density sucrose gradient. The conditions described here have been optimized for purification of mitochondrial ribosomes.\nNote: Separation is done according to the density of particles. Depending on the buffer used, it is possible to retrieve ribosomal subunits, or monosomes. This step is highly customizable and can be tailored to isolate other macromolecular complexes.\nLyse purified mitochondria.\nAdd 250 μL of lysis buffer to the mitochondrial pellet.\nPlace on a roller at 4°C for 15–20 min.\nMeanwhile, prepare the continuous density gradient.",
    "Prepare the 10% (w/v) and 30% (w/v) sucrose-TNM (Tris-NaCl-MgCl2), 2.5 mL of each solution per pair of gradients, and keep on ice.\nMark pairs of methanol-washed TLS-55 ultracentrifuge tubes using the appropriate block.\nFill each tube to the mark with 10% (w/v) sucrose-TNM.\nLoad 2.5 mL of 30% (w/v) sucrose-TNM into a syringe equipped with a blunt needle.\nInsert the needle to the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tube and load the solution from the bottom of the column, until the interphase reaches the mark.\nCap the tubes and carefully place them on the magnetic base of the gradient maker.\nRun the TLS-55 10–30 Sucrose Short program on the gradient maker.\nGently remove the tubes and keep them at 4°C until needed, limiting the manipulation of the tubes to avoid disruption of the formed continuous gradient.\nClarify the mitochondrial lysate by centrifugation (13,000 g, 5 min, 4°C).\nRemove 100 μL from the top of the gradient column in the ultracentrifugation tube and load 200 μL of clarified mitochondrial lysate by dispensing slowly against the inner wall of the tube.\nBalance the tubes, and ultracentrifuge (100,000 g, 2 h 15 min, 4°C).\nNote: The amount of material loaded on the continuous density gradient may require optimization. Avoid overloading the column (e.g. >2.5 mg of protein or >200 μL of sample in a TLS-55 ultracentrifuge tube) in order to obtain higher resolution of separation.\nAlternatives: The buffer composition, sucrose concentration and ultracentrifuge rotor can be adjusted to better suit the macromolecular complex being isolated.\nFractionate gradients (e.g., 100 μL per fraction) into methanol-washed 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "Alternatives: Fractionation can be performed manually or automatically, from the top or the bottom of the tube. The smaller the volume of each fraction, the higher the resolution of the fractionation, but the probability of introducing technical artefacts is also higher.\nOptional: Transfer 5–10 μL of each fraction into new tubes for SDS-PAGE analysis. This will inform on the integrity of the gradient, and the distribution of the complex across fractions.\nPause point: Fractions can be stored at -80°C for several months until needed for mass spectrometric analysis.\nQuantitative mass spectrometry\nTiming: 3–4 days\nProteins in liquid fractions from the density gradient are precipitated, digested, and processed for mass spectrometric analysis using a quantitative pipeline for SILAC. The duration of this step will depend on the number of fractions collected, and the pre-processing employed. The output of this step is a list of identified proteins, and their respective abundance between samples and across density gradient fractions.\nTransfer an adequate volume of sample (e.g., 30 μL) to washed 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nNote: The amount of material required for mass spectrometric analysis depends on the amount of total protein loaded on the density gradient, the amount of complex retrieved from it and the sensitivity of the mass spectrometric analysis used. In doubt, use as much volume as possible, as the processed material can be stored and used for additional mass spectrometric analyses.\nAdd 20 vol of cold ethanol to each fraction and incubate overnight (12–16 h) at -20°C.\nNote: Ethanol precipitation does not modify the protein residues while efficiently removing detergents with minimal protein loss, as well as allowing the easier resolubilisation of the precipitate. Alternative methods to concentrate proteins can be used.\nPellet the precipitate by centrifugation (16,000 g, 5 min, 4°C).",
    "Add 1% (w/w) trypsin in 50 mM NH4HCO3 to the pellets and incubate overnight (12–16 h) at 37°C.\nFractionate the obtained peptide digests by nano-scale reverse-phase liquid chromatography using a gradient of 5–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid over 84 min, at a flow rate of 300 nL min-1. The eluate is transferred directly to the electrospray interface of the mass spectrometer.\nAcquire data from 400 to 1,600 m/z for precursor ions and set the ten most abundant multiply charged precursor ions in each spectrum to be fragmented by HCD with nitrogen. Precursor and fragment ion spectra are acquired with resolutions of 70,000 and 17,500, respectively.\nCritical: The settings and instruments used for mass spectrometric analysis can be flexibly adjusted. The key point is that each fraction is processed identically across the gradient, including their sequential analysis to minimize the effect of variations in instrument performance on sample analysis.\nAnalysis of raw mass spectrometry data\nTiming: 1–24 h\nIn this step peptides are identified and quantified from raw mass spectrometry data. The setup of the analysis should not take more than 1 h with the analysis running for approximately 8–12 h depending on the number of analyzed fractions. At the end, a table of all detected peptides matched to proteins is produced.\nUsing the Proteome Discoverer Deamon Utility submit the raw mass spectrometry files for all fractions for analysis by Proteome Discoverer.\nIdentify peptides by comparing the MS/MS spectra to the appropriate Mascot database with Proteome Discoverer.\nQuantify peptides using Proteome Discoverer.\nOpen a report from all fractions.\nExport the report of all peptides from all fractions as a single tab delimited text file (please refer to ComPrAn help files). Make sure that “Peptides” box is checked under Criteria. The stem “psms” will be automatically added into the filename.",
    "Use file from step 48 as an input for analysis by the ComPrAn R package.\nNote: For the analysis of samples from HEK 293 cells, we used following parameters: proteins were searched against human UniProt database; mass tolerances of 10 ppm and 0.5 Da were used for precursor ions and fragmented ions, respectively; trypsin was selected as the protease with one missed cleavage allowed; dynamic modifications included N-terminal acetylation and formylation, oxidation of methionine and propionamide modification of cysteine; Mascot was configured to consider the possibility of the presence of the heavy-labelled lysine and arginine.\nAnalysis of peptide level data\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section describes analysis of peptide level data with the use of ComPrAn R package. As an output, a table of normalized protein data, lists of proteins detected only in one sample, a table of clustered proteins, as well as various visualizations of results are created. Analysis steps are illustrated in Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nNote: Two types of input data can be used in ComPrAn: i) peptide data or ii) normalized protein data. In this protocol steps 51 to 58 describe a workflow for processing peptide level data, that results in the generation of normalized protein data which are used from step 59 onwards.\nNote: ComPrAn contains internal example datasets: i) peptide dataset obtained with Proteome Discoverer version 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in combination with Mascot database for peptide quantification and identification, respectively and ii) normalized protein dataset obtained by processing the example peptide dataset (i) in ComPrAn.
