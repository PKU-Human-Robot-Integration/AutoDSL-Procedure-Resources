  "procedures": [
    "In order to obtain a cell free preparation of outer membrane vesicles and vesicle chains, M. xanthus strain DZ2 (wild type) cells were harvested from restreaks on CYE Petri plates, 3-21 days old and inoculated into 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 25 ml of liquid CYE media (10:1 volume of flask:volume of culture ratio should be maintained for aerobic cultures of M. xanthus). A single 25 ml culture is sufficient for isolating ~200 μg of OMVs for further analysis.Cultures were grown with shaking at 200 rpm, 32 °C for 2 days to an OD600 = 2.0 (~2 x 109 cells/ml) in a Thermo Scientific MaxQ4000 shaking incubator. Cultures were transferred to 50 ml centrifuge tubes and vortexed for 30 sec to disperse aggregates and release vesicles. Note that for M. xanthus, large cell aggregates are common, and this duration of vortexing may not be needed when adapting to other bacterial species. Cultures should be handled at room temperature for steps 3-6, as cold temperature disrupts cell viability and impinges on fractionation. The vortexed culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 x g to pellet whole cells. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter to remove any remaining cells. Filtrate was further centrifuged as in step 4, then passed through 0.22 μm syringe filters to remove debris. Cell free filtrate was then subjected to 140,000 x g centrifugation at 4 °C using an ultracentrifuge for 1 h to harvest outer membrane vesicles, vesicle chains and membrane tubes, that will be in the resulting pellet and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Samples were then saved at -80 °C or subjected immediately to analysis.",
    "Samples were analyzed by two methods described below to (a) monitor the purity of vesicle fractions by fluorescent lipid dye binding and (b) monitor the purity and quality of vesicle fractions by electron microscopy. Additional analyses can also be performed, for instance, proteomic analyses have indicated that the OMV protein fraction is consistent with little to no contamination from any other large protein complexes.Sample aliquots were mixed with fluorescent lipid dye FM 4-64 (purchased as a 100 μg dry stock, stored at -20 °C until use) to a final volume of 100 μl and final concentration of 16 μM. The relative concentration of vesicle samples was determined using black 96 well plates and a fluorescence plate reader by exciting at 515 nm, measuring emission at 640 nm. Five independent samples were analyzed for each biological preparation, as mixtures are heterogeneous. 16 μM FM 4-64 in PBS should be used as a negative control, while whole cell fractions can be utilized as positive controls. Fluorescence units may vary, but successful preparations should be 10-40 fold or higher than negative control readings. 1:1 Serial dilutions of samples may be required if signal saturation occurs. Yield increases with increasing cell density and with stable surface grown cultures (biofilms) relative to aerobic liquid cultures but ~200 μg or more is obtainable with this protocol. Negative-stained TEM samples were prepared by applying 3 μl of the OMV samples in 3 replicates to 200 mesh formvar coated TEM grids, allowing 3 min to settle and rinsing briefly in distilled water. A 2.0 % solution of Uranyl acetate was applied to cover the grid before immediately blotting off and air drying.",
    "Samples were imaged on a FEI CM200 microscope with a 2k x 2k Gatan CCD camera or on a JEOL 1200 microscope, operated at 200 kV or 120 kV, respectively, with quality judged by the presence of vesicles and vesicle chains and the absence of cells or cellular debris.
