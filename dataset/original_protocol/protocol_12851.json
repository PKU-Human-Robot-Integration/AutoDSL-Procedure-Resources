    "1. Preparation of Effector and Reporter Gene Constructs\nBuild effector constructs that employ a constitutive promoter (e.g. maize ubiquitin, UBI) to drive expression from a desired open reading frame. For example, construct a plasmid containing UBI::TaABF1 to drive strong constitutive expression of TaABF15.\nBuild reporter constructs that include the promoter whose activity is to be measured, placed upstream of an open reading frame, such as GUS. For example, construct a plasmid containing HVA1::GUS to measure expression from the HVA1 promoter2,5.\nBuild an internal control construct (e.g. UBI::luciferase).\nUsing a silica binding column protocol (see Table of Materials), prepare high-quality plasmid for each of the required gene constructs. Using ultraviolet spectroscopy (see Table of Materials), carefully measure the concentration of each plasmid preparation.\n2. Preparation of Barley Grains for Bombardment\nSet up a spreadsheet (see Figure 1 for an example) indicating the plasmids that will be bombarded, the appropriate hormone treatments, and other relevant information for each treatment that will be part of the experiment.\nUsing a cutting board and a sterile razor blade, cut off the embryos from grains of Himalaya barley (40 for each treatment included in the experiment). Exclude grains that are discolored or substantially smaller than average.\nPlace all the embryoless grains into a 50 mL tube. Add 40 mL of water and rock for 10 minutes.\nPour out the water carefully (to avoid losing grains) and add 40 mL of 10% bleach. Rock for 20 minutes.\nPour out the bleach and add 40 mL of sterile water. Rock for 5 minutes. Repeat this sterile water wash four more times.\nAdd 40 mL of Imbibing Solution (20 mM sodium succinate, 20 mM calcium chloride, pH 5.0) and 40 μL of chloramphenicol stock solution (10 mg/mL).",
    "Transfer most of the Imbibing Solution (with chloramphenicol) from the tube into a Vermiculite Plate (see Table of Materials). Then transfer the grains onto the surface of the wet filter paper in the Vermiculite Plate. Spread out the grains evenly. Pour in enough imbibing solution to keep the grains partially (but not completely) submerged. Place the lid on top of the Vermiculite Plate.\nIncubate the embryoless grains at 24 °C for about 48 h with fluorescent lighting. Add additional Imbibing Solution as necessary.\nOpen up a 90 mm plastic petri dish and pour 20 mL of Imbibing Solution into the dish itself and 20 mL into the inverted lid. Add 20 μL of chloramphenicol (10 mg/mL) to each. Sterilize two pairs of fine point forceps by dipping them in alcohol.\nPlace a few of the embryoless grains into the lid of the petri dish. Using the forceps, gently remove the (transparent) seed coat from each grain. While removing the seed coat from the smooth side of the grain, do not damage the underlying (aleurone) cells. Transfer the peeled grain to the petri dish containing Imbibing Solution.\nAfter peeling the seed coat from all of the grains, return them to the Vermiculite Plate. Incubate the peeled embryoless grains at 24 °C for 16 - 20 hours.\nJust before using the grains for bombardment, remove surface moisture by shaking them between filter papers in a petri dish.\n3. Preparation of Plasmid DNA for Bombardment\nLabel a 1.5 mL tube for each treatment that will be included in the bombardment experiment. To each tube add 2.5 µg of UBI::luciferase internal control plasmid, 2.5 µg of a GUS reporter plasmid, and the desired amount (typically 0.025 µg to 2.5 µg) of an effector plasmid. Add water to bring the total volume to 5 µL.",
    "Prepare 1.6 µm gold microcarriers (see Table of Materials) following published protocols6.\nFor each treatment, add 50 µL of suspended microcarriers into the 1.5 mL tube containing plasmid DNA. Coat the microcarriers with plasmid DNA according to manufacturer's protocols6.\nAt the final step, when the plasmid-coated microcarriers are suspended in 48 µL 100% ethanol, pipet 8 μL of suspended microcarriers onto each of five macrocarriers and allow them to air dry.\n4. Particle Bombardment of Embryoless Barley Grains\nSet up the particle bombardment apparatus (see Table of Materials)6.\nPlace a 1550 psi rupture disk into the retaining cap and mount it on the instrument.\nPlace a macrocarrier containing the desired plasmid combination (together with a stopping screen) into the microcarrier launch assembly. Insert the assembly into the top slot of the bombardment chamber. Set the distance between the rupture disc retaining cap and the macrocarrier cover lid at the standard distance (6 mm), and place the stopping screen support at the (standard) middle position, allowing a macrocarrier travel distance of 11 mm (Figure 2A).\nArrange 8 embryoless grains in a tight radial pattern (with the thinner ends pointing inward) on a filter paper circle that is taped down flat to the lid of a 90 mm petri dish (see Figure 2B).\nPlace the dish with the grains into the bombardment chamber, at a distance of 6 cm from the stopping screen.\nEvacuate the bombardment chamber to 95 kPa and then bombard the sample.\nAfter releasing the vacuum, transfer the bombarded grains to a labeled 60 mm petri dish containing 4 mL of Imbibing Solution containing 1 mg/ml of chloramphenicol.\nRepeat until all of the bombardments have been completed. Incubate (on a shaking platform at 100 rpm) at 24 °C for 24 hours.",
    "5. Extraction of Soluble Protein from the Bombarded Grains\nUsing forceps, remove the 8 bombarded grains from a 60 mm petri dish and blot them dry on a paper towel. Divide the grains into two labeled 2.0 mL tubes (4 grains per tube) each containing 800 μL Grinding Buffer (100 mM Na phosphate pH 7.2, 5 mM DTT, 10 µg/mL leupeptin, 20% glycerol) and a 5 mm stainless steel bead. Repeat this process for all of bombarded grains.\nPlace (up to 48) 2.0 mL tubes into the two racks of the bead homogenizer (see Table of Materials). Mount the racks on the homogenizer.\nShake the samples at 30 Hz for 3 minutes.\nRemove the homogenizer racks from the homogenizer and place them on ice (5 min) to re-cool the samples.\nMount the racks back on the homogenizer - in the opposite orientation. Shake the samples again at 30 Hz for 3 minutes.\nCool the racks on ice, then repeat Steps 5.3 to 5.5. This will add up to a total of 12 minutes of shaking.\nCentrifuge the grain extracts at 16,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 minutes.\nImmediately after the centrifugation, decant the clear supernatants into a second set of microcentrifuge tubes. Give each tube a quick vortex. Store the tubes on ice.\nAfter transferring the supernatant, recover the steel beads from the pellets so they can be washed and reused.\n6. Measurement of Luciferase Activity from Grain Extracts\nFor each tube of grain extract to be assayed, prepare a 12 mm x 75 mm glass test tube containing 200 μL of Luciferase Assay Mixture (45 mM Tris sulfate pH 7.7, 15 mM MgCl2, 20 mM DTT, 1.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM luciferin, 1 mM ATP).",
    "Add 100 μL of the first grain extract to the first assay tube. Vortex quickly to mix well. Immediately place the tube into the tube holder of the luminometer and close the door. When the measurement is finished, remove the tube from the luminometer – leaving the door open for placement of the next tube.\nRepeat this process until all the samples have been measured.\n7. Measurement of GUS Activity from Grain Extracts\nAdd 200 μL of GUS Assay Buffer (50 mM Na phosphate pH 7.2, 2.5 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl--D-glucuronide, 10 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 10 µg/mL leupeptin, 20% methanol, 0.02% sodium azide) to each well of a 96 well plate.\nPlace 50 μL of each grain extract into the corresponding well. Mix with the tip after adding. Seal the top with sealing film.\nIncubate the 96 well plate at 37 °C in the dark for 20 hours.\nCentrifuge the 96 well plate at 4,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 minutes and place it on ice.\nAdd 250 μL of 0.2 M Na2CO3 to each well of a black 96 well plate.\nAdd 6.25 μL of each centrifuged GUS assay mixture into the corresponding well (containing 0.2 M Na2CO3) of the black 96 well plate. Mix with the tip after adding. Include wells with 6.25 μL of 10 μM, 40 μM, and 100 μM 4-methylumbelliferone as standards.\nPlace the black plate into a plate fluorometer and read the fluorescence of methylumbelliferone. Take the readings at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm, and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Set the gain of the instrument such that a well containing 6.25 μL of 40 μM 4-methylumbelliferone and 250 μL of 0.2 M Na2CO3 gives a reading of 1000 fluorescence units.\n8. Data Analysis",
    "Enter the values for the luciferase and GUS assays into a spreadsheet. Exclude from consideration any sample with a luciferase reading of lower than 20,000 relative luminescence units s-1, as this indicates that the gene constructs were not successfully delivered to the aleurone cells.\nFor each successfully bombarded grain extract (representing a group of four embryoless grains), calculate the normalized GUS expression from the raw GUS and luciferase data as follows: normalized GUS = [(GUS expression - GUS blank) x (2,000,000)] / (luciferase expression – luciferase blank).\n\tNOTE: This normalizes the amount of GUS activity to what would have been observed in a bombardment that gave a luciferase reading of 2,000,000.\nReport the relative level of expression of a particular reporter construct in the presence of effector constructs or hormone treatments being tested by comparing to the level of expression in the absence of effectors or hormones.\nSubscription Required.
