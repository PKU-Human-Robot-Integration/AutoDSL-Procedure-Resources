    "This experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Expert Committee at the First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, and performed at the University experimental laboratory, Department of Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, in accordance with Act No. 246/1992 Coll. on the protection of animals against cruelty. All the animals were treated and cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition, published by National Academies Press, 2011. All the procedures were performed according to standard veterinary conventions in the presence and under the guidance of a licensed veterinarian. Six New Zealand white rabbits were included in this series of experiments. Their mean body weight was 3.5 kg ± 1 kg on the day of pacemaker implantation. All the values are expressed as mean ± SEM and, if appropriate, by ranges of minimum and maximum measured values. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. For successful mastering of the technique, basic skills in animal anesthesia and surgery are necessary; previous experience with cardiac pacing is advisable but not required.\n1. Preoperative care\nAllow the rabbits to acclimate to their housing facility for at least 2 weeks and become comfortable with human touch and manipulation to facilitate the handling and management of the animals on the day of the surgery.\nFeed the animals hay and hay-based pelleted rabbit diet. Provide fresh water at regular intervals.\nCarry out a short daily check of their vitals (body temperature, respiratory rate) and overall condition, including optimal dietary intake and absence of distress.\n2. Anesthesia, premedication, and monitoring\nAfter 30 min of fasting, administer premedication: buprenorphine (0.01-0.04 mg/kg IM), midazolam (0.3-0.6 mg/kg IM), medetomidine (0.03-0.06 mg/kg IM), and ketamine (5-10 mg/kg IM).",
    "Insert a cannula into the marginal ear vein for intravenous drug application. Collect blood samples using low-volume tubes (0.5 mL) for hematological and biochemical analyses.\nShave the rabbit's skin using a shaver at the right jugular region on the neck — the surgical site — and on the limbs to attach the electrodes for ECG monitoring. Shave with care, as the skin of rabbits is easily susceptible to irritation and small tears are commonly seen.\nPlace the animal on a heating pad to prevent hypothermia.\nMonitor the vital functions, including ECG, rectal body temperature, and oxygen saturation by a pulse oximeter, according to the anesthesia protocol.\nPlace a mask over the animal's mouth and nose and secure it by a rubber seal around the animal's face. Use ointment to protect the animal's eyes from dryness.\nTo achieve adequate sedation, provide the animals with isoflurane (mixed with oxygen) via the facial mask. Start with a 3.5% concentration and reduce as needed according to the animal's responses in terms of a suppressed corneal reflex and motoric pain response.\n\tNOTE: To reduce the risk of lung injury during the anesthesia, spontaneous ventilation is recommended, but a neonatal manual or automatic ventilator must be kept ready in case of hypoventilation.\nPrepare all sterile instrumentation.\nPosition the animal on a fluoroscopy table. Wear full X-ray personal protective equipment.\n3. Ventricular lead implantation\nLocate the external jugular vein and mark its position on the skin.\nSterilize the entire region using povidone-iodine and proceed to cover the site of surgery with a sterile drape with a hole over the marked jugular area.",
    "Make an incision on the skin parallel over the marked jugular vein. Locate the external jugular vein and isolate a length of 1 cm from the adjacent fibrous tissue and the vascular bundle. Find the carotid artery for orientation and to prevent its injury.\nCreate a pocket in the subcutaneous tissue to accommodate the pacemaker. Use scissors for blunt dissection to prevent excessive bleeding and tissue damage.\nSecure the vessel using a rubber tie on both ends of the isolated vessel segment and occlude the blood flow (Figure 1).\nUsing the standard cut-down technique, make a cut of approximately 1/3 of the circumference of the vessel wall with a blade.\nUse a vessel pick to widely open the cut and introduce a single passive pacing lead into the lumen.\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance, further advance its tip to the apex of the right ventricle (Figure 2). Pre-shape a stylet into a curve and use it to guide the lead to pass the tricuspid annulus. Ensure that the tip of the lead is unsupported by the stylet so that the lead remains flexible and atraumatic when touching the tissue.\nTest the pacing parameters. The ventricular lead sensed signal and impedance must be stable, and the pacing threshold should be low. There should be no fasciculation of the adjacent muscles (Figure 3).\nSecure the lead position by stitching it over a protective rubber sleeve to the underlying fibrous tissue and seal the vessel lumen around the lead using a silk tie (Figure 4).\n4. Pacemaker implantation\nConnect the pacemaker to the pacing lead and secure the IS-1 connector using a screw. If the non-invasive pacing study function (see step 6) will be utilized during the follow-up, connect the pacemaker to the atrial channel socket.",
    "Bury the pacemaker and the extra length of the lead into the preformed subcutaneous pocket (Figure 5).\nFlush the pocket with povidone-iodine. Suture the skin wound using a monofilament thread.\nSet the desired pacing program and perform a final check of the pacing parameters (Figure 3).\n5. Postoperative care\nWithdraw the anesthetics and observe the animal carefully until it regains adequate consciousness.\nAdminister atipamezole (0.01-0.03 mg/kg IM) to revert the action of the medetomidine.\nAfter consciousness has been restored and optimal body temperature achieved, administer meloxicam (0.4-0.6 mg/kg) subcutaneously for pain relief. Add buprenorphine after 6-8 h if the pain relief is not adequate according to a valid pain assessment scale (e.g., Rabbit grimace scale).\nAdminister metoclopramide (0.5-1 mg/kg IV) to prevent further gastrointestinal stasis and to stimulate gastric motility and continue 3x per day until adequate food intake and stool production are restored.\nFollow a wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic regimen until the wounds have healed (enrofloxacin at 10-20 mg/kg 2x per day for 3-7 days).\nTransfer the animal to a comfortable and familiar environment and observe it until it regains sufficient consciousness. Do not return the rabbit to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered.\nMaintain meloxicam (0.4-0.6 mg/kg SC) administration daily for at least 5 days.\nMonitor and dress the wounds regularly to ensure safe and timely healing.\nWhen fully healed, approximately 14 days after the procedure, remove the non-absorbable skin sutures.\nPerform remote interrogation and check the pacing parameters regularly (i.e., pacing threshold, myocardial sensing, and lead impedance).\n\t​NOTE: The obtained values should follow a stable trend.\n6. Pacing protocol and data collection\nInterrogate the pacemaker and set the backup pacing mode by selecting minimal base rate in the Parameters menu.",
    "NOTE: Owing to the high heart rate and its high variability native to small animals, continuous artificial pacing can be achieved at a rate of 300-400 bpm, according to the specified requirements. Intermittent pacing can be achieved during each pacemaker interrogation (follow step 6.4 and Figure 6).\nRecord the pacing lead impedance continuously; in the pacemaker programmer Diagnostics menu, start data collection.\nRecord the myocardial potential continuously and check it manually every week by interrogation of the pacemaker; in the pacemaker programmer Test menu under the Sensing tab, measure the unipolar and bipolar myocardial potential amplitudes.\nAssess the pacing threshold regularly (weekly) by interrogation. Use the non-invasive pacing study (select NIPS under Test menu) function to measure the pacing threshold with a sufficient pacing rate (Figure 6). Assess the pacing threshold for various stimulus durations (from 0.1 ms to 1.5 ms) and express it in volts. Use the intracardiac electrograms or surface ECG for the determination of the loss of capture when the pacing stimulus output becomes subthreshold.\nPerform all the procedures according to standard veterinary conventions, sacrifice the animal according to the institutional regulations at the completion of each study, and perform a necropsy. Explant the pacemaker and lead and examine them for inflammatory responses, biofilm formation, and fibrosis.\n\tNOTE: A potassium overdose was given under deep anesthesia to euthanize the animals in this protocol."
