    "Note: Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the protocol. All spins are at 400 x g (2,000 rpm) for 30 sec unless otherwise stated and buffer recipes are listed at the end.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170614/20170614230159_7464.jpgFigure 1. Flowchart of the smFISH protocol for the C. elegans gonad Probe preparation for usesmFISH probes can be designed and purchased through the Biosearch Technologies website (https://www.biosearchtech.com/[href=https://www.biosearchtech.com/]). Choose fluorophores compatible with the microscopic system used for the experiments. For multiplexed probes, carefully choose probe-conjugated fluorophores to eliminate bleed-through between channels during image acquisition. To store smFISH probes, resuspend in 20 µl TE buffer (see Recipes) at pH 8.0 (final concentration of 250 µM) and store at -20 °C. This stock solution can be diluted to an appropriate dilution (e.g., 1:10-1:100) in TE buffer to make the working solution. Choose the dilution that works best for smFISH (e.g., the highest signal-to-noise ratio) and keep diluted probe solution at -20 °C in the dark. The frozen probe solution should be thawed at RT when used for smFISH. In our hands, multiple rounds of freezing-thawing did not affect the performance of smFISH. Do not boil the probes.Day 1: Gonad dissections for smFISHWipe down bench top, gloves, and pipettors with RNaseZap®.Pick worms from growth plates into glass Petri dish (or depression slide) with PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBSTw) containing anesthesia (e.g., 0.25 mM levamisole [or tetramisole]). Alternatively, add 200-300 µl PBSTw with anesthesia to growth plate and pipet worms into Petri dish or depression slide. A larger volume (1-2 ml) of PBSTw can also be used for moving worms into Petri dish. In case of whole worm staining, skip steps B2-B3 and proceed to step B4.Extrude gonads as quickly as possible (< 10 min including spin) directly in the Petri dish.",
    "Cut behind pharynx or at tail with a #10 scalpel or a needle (Figure 2) (Crittenden et al., 2017).Pipet extruded gonads into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Spin and remove supernatant.Add 1 ml fix solution (final 3.7% formaldehyde v/v in 1x PBS + 0.1% Tween-20) and incubate for at least 15 min (up to 45 min) at room temperature (RT) on rocker.Spin down the sample.Wash 1 x in 1 ml PBSTw.Incubate for 10 min in 1 ml 1x PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 at RT to permeabilize.Wash 2 x with 1 ml PBSTw.Resuspend in 1 ml 70% EtOH and incubate at 4 °C for 16-18 h (overnight). The sample can be stored in 70% EtOH for up to one week.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170614/20170614230543_6950.jpgFigure 2. Gonad extrusion. Cut the head (behind the pharynx) or tail of the worm (black dashed lines) using a scalpel or a needle to extrude gonads. Internal pressure of the worm causes gonads to extrude readily. Image: Maria Gallegos.Day 2: HybridizationMake wash buffer fresh, letting formamide come to RT before opening.Bring hybridization buffer (HB) to RT before opening.Thaw diluted probe, protecting from light.Spin the extruded gonads prepared on Day 1, remove ethanol.Add 1 ml wash buffer, equilibrate for 5 min at RT. Spin and remove as much buffer as possible.Add 1 μl diluted probe to 100 μl HB per sample (final probe concentration of 0.025-0.5 µM) and gently flick the tube (see Day 2 hybridization notes).Resuspend sample in HB with probe and mix well.Incubate overnight at 37 °C, with rotation and protected from light.Note: You can leave samples for up to 48 h at this step.Day 3: Wash and mount samples (all at room temperature)Add 1 ml smFISH wash buffer, invert to mix. Spin and remove buffer.",
    "Note: If worms don’t pellet well due to HB viscosity, this spin may be done at 400-500 x g (2,200-2,400 rpm) for 1.5 min.Wash with 1 ml wash buffer + 1 μg/ml DAPI for 30 min on rotator (protected from light).Wash 2 x with 1 ml wash buffer.Note: Either wash 5 min on the rotator or invert tube ~10 times before spinning down again.Remove as much wash buffer as possible from fixed samples.Resuspend gonads in the mounting media (e.g., ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant or GLOX buffer).Let sit for 30 min to a few hours.Pipet 12-15 µl onto a slide, cover with a 22 x 22 coverslip. Remove excess liquid.Cure at least overnight and up to 4 days in the dark at room temp or 4 °C. The ProLong Gold user manual recommends a ‘curing’ process (~24 h at RT) for best performance. We have observed that the curing process does improve fluorescence signal.Seal with nail polish for long term storage."
