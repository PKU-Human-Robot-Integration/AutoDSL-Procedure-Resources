    "Animals received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Principles of Laboratory Animals, prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and published by the National Institutes of Health. All animal protocols were approved by the responsible local authority (\"Amt für Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz, Hansestadt (Office for Health and Consumer Protection) Hamburg\").\n1. Animal Care\nObtain Lewis rats (LEW/Crl) rats and ROSA/luciferase-LEW transgenic rats weighing 300-350 g from the Institute of Laboratory Animals.\nKeep the rats under conventional conditions in ventilated cabinets and feed them standard rat chow and autoclaved water ad libitum.\nPerform a graft transplantation using the ROSA/luciferase-LEW transgenic rats as the donors and the syngenic LEW/Crl rats as the recipients.\n2. Preparation of the Donor Rat\nUse an induction chamber to anaesthetize a rat with isoflurane (2.5-3%).\nPlace the rat on its back and maintain the anesthesia with a facemask covering the mouth and nose. Check for sufficient depth of anesthesia by pinching the hind feet and verifying the absence of reflexes. Apply some vet ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.   \nSpread the hind legs and fix their position using tape.\nShave the inguinal hair with a hair trimmer and disinfect the entire area using povidone-iodine followed by 80% ethanol. Repeat the disinfection step twice.\n\tNOTE: The surgical area, gauze, and surgical instruments should be sterilized. Maintain a sterile field throughout the procedure and wear single-use, sterile surgical gloves, masks, and caps.\nUnder a microscope, perform a vertical incision along the linea inguinalis. Use two forceps to gently separate the subcutaneous tissues and expose the superficial epigastric vein from its origin on the femoral vein. Carefully isolate the superficial epigastric vein from the surrounding tissues.\nStop blood flow in the superficial epigastric vein using two micro clamps.",
    "Harvest an approximately 0.5 to 1 cm segment of the vein by carefully lifting the isolated vein with forceps and cutting through the vessel with microscissors. Leave the micro clamps on the vessel stump to prevent the loss of blood. Place the removed piece of vein on sterile gauze. Carefully place a 30 G needle inside one end of the harvested vein and flush the vessel with heparin (50 units/ml).\n\tNOTE: Handle the vein with care and avoid damage during lifting, cutting, and flushing. Make sure to flush the graft with the proper amount of heparin.\nKeep the vessel segment in 1% lidocaine on ice until transplantation into the recipient rat to prevent a vessel spasm.\nEuthanize the donor rat by increasing the anesthesia to 5% isoflurane. After 2-3 min, open the abdomen along the linea alba, cut through the diaphragm, and remove the heart to stop circulation.\n3. Preparation of the Recipient Rat\nAnesthetize and fix the recipient rat in the same way as the donor rat.\nShave the medial side of the legs with a hair trimmer and disinfect three times using povidone-iodine and 80% ethanol.  \nMonitor the depth of anesthesia and ensure that it is sufficient by verifying the absence of reflexes when pinching the hind feet.\nPerform a median femoral incision from the knee to the inguinal fold. Under a microscope, use 2 forceps to separate the femoral artery from its surroundings.\nUse micro clamps to stop the flow of blood. Place the proximal clamp first, followed by the distal clamp.\nCut out a short segment of the clamped femoral artery with microscissors and discard it. Shorten the remaining arterial stump with microscissors, creating a gap that is 1-2 mm larger than the vein graft. Flush the arterial stump with heparin using a 30 G needle.",
    "NOTE: If the adventitia protrudes slightly beyond the vessel stump, use forceps to pull it slightly over the end of the vessel and remove a piece.\nPlace the harvested vein from step 2.8 between the arterial stumps and adjust the length so that it fits suitably into the gap. Note the direction of the vein.\nPerform the proximal anastomosis first using a 10-0 prolene suture. Conduct single stitches in the order shown (Figure 1D). Start with a suture on each lateral side before adding three more sutures on the ventral side. Afterwards, place three stitches on the dorsal side of the vessel to complete the anastomosis.  \nConnect the distal vessels with the graft using the same technique as for the proximal anastomosis described in step 3.8. Again, start with a suture on each lateral side, and then place three sutures on the ventral side and the dorsal side.\nLoad two 1-mL syringes with fibrin glue component 1 and 2. Carefully lift the graft with forceps and drop approximately 100 μl of fibrin glue component 1 under the graft, followed by component 2.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that components 1 and 2 are applied in a 1:1 ratio.\nPlace the graft back in its position and drop an additional 100 μl of components 1 and 2 on top of the graft. Be sure that the glue covers both the graft and the anastomosis in order to prevent anastomotic insufficiency and over-distension of the vein graft.  \nCarefully open the distal clamp, followed by the proximal.\nConfirm a successful surgery by checking for a visible pulse in the transplanted vein and distal artery of the graft.\nRemove excessive glue, which impedes skin closure. Use forceps to lift the cured glue and remove the excess with microscissors. Close the skin layers with 5-0 prolene sutures.",
    "Inject 4-5 mg/kg Carprofen subcutaneously before allowing the rat to wake up. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Keep the animal in a single cage until it is fully recovered.\nAdd Metamizole to the drinking water (50 mg Metamizole per 100 ml) as pain medication for the following 3 days and monitor the animal daily.  \n4. Duplex Sonography\nNOTE: Use duxplex sonography to visualize blood flow non-invasively in rats14.\nAnaesthetize a rat in an induction chamber (isoflurane 2%). Place the rat on its back and maintain anesthesia with a facemask covering the nose.\nUse hair clippers and hair removal cream to remove the hair around the area of the thigh.\nApply ultrasound gel to the thigh. Make sure that there are no air bubbles. Acquire duplex sonography images using an MS 400 transducer (center frequency: 30 MHz) with a frame rate of 230-400 frames/sec.  \n5. Histopathology\nNOTE: Harvest and stain the vessel with Masson’s trichrome staining for morphometric analysis15.\nFix the harvested vessel in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and dehydrate it in increasing concentrations of ethanol.  Embed the sample in paraffin and cut it into 5 μm thick slices using a microtome.\n\tNOTE: Paraformaldehyde is toxic and should be handled with special care.\nDeparaffinize the slides before staining them with trichrome staining solution. Dehydrate the stained slides, clear them with xylene, and mount them in mounting medium. After drying the slides, view the samples with a microscope.   \n6. Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI)\nNOTE: The postoperative graft was tracked over time in vivo by measuring bioluminescent signal16.\nDissolve 1 g of D-Luciferin potassium salt in 22 ml of PBS and inject it intraperitoneally into the rat (375 mg/kg body weight). Wait 15 min for the luciferin to circulate in the animal.",
    "Place the rat into a real-time bioluminescent quantification system and access the bioluminescence signal.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
