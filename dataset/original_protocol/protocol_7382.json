    "Preparation of bacteria for mice infection  From a frozen glycerol stock (bacteria grown overnight were frozen in 15% v/v final strength sterile glycerol), inoculate the GAS strain into 10 mL of THY medium in 15 mL sealed conical tubes. Culture the bacteria statically at 37 °C for 16 h.Transfer 3 mL of overnight culture into 47 mL of pre-warmed fresh THY medium in 50 mL sealed conical tubes. Grow the bacteria at 37 °C without agitation to the mid-log phase, until the optical density at 600 nm (OD600  ) reaches 0.3–0.4.Centrifuge culture tubes at 4,000  × g  and 14 °C for 10 min, and discard the supernatant. Wash the bacterial pellet after suspending it in 20 mL of sterile PBS. Centrifuge at 4,000  × g  and 14 °C for 10 min. Repeat the washing step twice. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 1 mL of sterile PBS.Measure the OD600  of the bacterial suspension and adjust it with PBS to 0.8 (corresponding to 1 × 109  CFU/mL). Dilute the bacterial culture 1:20 in PBS to get 5 × 107  CFU/mL (sub-lethal dose). Place the tubes on ice until use.CFU counts are determined to calculate the number of bacteria injected into the mice. First, serially dilute the bacterial inoculum to seven dilutions, by adding 100 µL of inoculum to 900 µL of PBS. Next, plate 100 µL of the 10-5  , 10-6  , and 10-7  dilutions onto blood agar plates. Finally, incubate the plates at 37 °C overnight.To determine the CFU/mL, count the number of colonies on the blood agar plates in the appropriate dilution and multiply by the dilution factor.",
    "In vivo soft-tissue model  Three to four weeks old female BALB/c OlaHsd mice (weighing 10–12 g) were left to acclimatize for three days in disposable cages supplemented with enrichment, sterile food, and water, in specific pathogen-free (SPF) rooms with controlled environmental conditions.Weigh mice and distribute them evenly in cages. Mark mice on ears and shave their dorsal flanks one day before bacterial infection.Different groups of mice receive 100 µL of subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal (IP) injections of GSK2656157 (100 µg/mouse/injection) or ISRIB (35 µg/mouse/injection) or control (90 µL of saline + 10 µL of DMSO and PEG 400 at 1:1 ratio).Inject GSK2656157/ISRIB subcutaneously 4 h before bacterial infection. Subsequently, SC and IP injections of the inhibitors are alternately given at an interval of 12 h post-infection (PI) until the sixth day. In the post-treatment mice experiment, inject GSK2656157/ISRIB subcutaneously for 12 h PI, followed by IP and SC injections of GSK2656157/ISRIB, which are given alternately at an interval of 12 h until the sixth day (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4589/bioprotoc-12-24-4589-g001.jpg Figure 1. Timeline of the injection of inhibitors and sampling procedure.  BALB/c mice were placed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions with controlled environmental conditions. They were weighed, shaved on dorsal flanks, and marked for identification. Mice were infected by subcutaneous (SC) administration of 5 × 106  CFU of GAS strain, and were either untreated, treated 4 h before infection, or treated 12 h post-infection (PI) with GSK2656157/ISRIB. The inhibitors were injected every 12 h alternately with dose 1 (D1) and dose 2 (D2) through SC or intraperitoneal (IP) routes for 6 days. Sampling (S1, S2, S3, and S4) for quantification of bacteria through skin biopsy was performed at different time intervals.Inject mice with a sub-lethal dose (5 × 106  CFU) of GAS to test the efficacy of GSK2656157/ISRIB.",
    "A volume of 100 µL of the bacterial solution is injected SC into the rear flank of mice. The bacterial load is confirmed by serial dilution and CFU estimation on blood agar plates.Euthanize mice by inhalation of isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation, and collect skin tissue samples using an 8.0-mm punch biopsy tool at different time points. Transfer the tissue samples to 2 mL Eppendorf tubes containing 0.5 mL of sterile PBS. Homogenize skin tissue samples using a homogenizer at a vibration speed of 20,000 ± 100 rpm for 30 s, dilute this in PBS, and plate the samples on blood agar plates. CFUs are quantified after incubation of blood agar plates at 37 °C overnight. The amount of CFU is normalized to the weight of the soft tissue sample.Measure the dermonecrotic lesion area of the mice in different groups daily, using a digital vernier caliper. The lesion area is calculated with the formula A = π/2)(length)(width) (Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2018). The maximum permissible dermonecrotic lesion area is 2 cm2  .All the quantitative data (CFU counts and dermonecrotic lesion area) can be tested for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism 5.03 software."
