  "procedures": [
    "All procedures in the current study were performed using Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocols for animal handling at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA.\n1. Uaa Incorporation in Kir2.1 and Expression of the Resultant PIRK in the Primary Neuronal Culture\nDNA Construction\n\t\nSelect a target site of Kir2.1 for Uaa incorporation. Exploit prior knowledge and information about structure and function of Kir2.1, so that the chosen site with the photoresponsive Uaa incorporated enables optical modulation of Kir2.1 function21.\nConstruct a recombinant DNA encoding Kir2.1 gene with the chosen site mutated to the TAG amber stop codon. Use the standard cloning techniques25 to clone the Kir2.1-TAG DNA into a mammalian expression plasmid.\nClone tRNA/synthetase genes that are specific for the Uaa and incorporate the Uaa in response to the TAG stop codon into another mammalian expression plasmid21.\n\t\tNote: For optimal Uaa incorporation, different promoters and combinations of gene cassettes (for tRNA, synthetase, and Kir2.1) can be tested in different plasmids.\nObtain high quality plasmid DNAs using miniprep or maxiprep commercial kits according to manufacturer's protocol. Around 1.9 of the 260/280 ratio is optimal for the purified DNA. When necessary, perform an agarose gel electrophoresis to check purity of the prepped DNA25. Supercoiled plasmid DNAs with high purity are best for neuronal transfection.\nCulture Rat Hippocampal Primary Neurons\n\t\nPlace glass coverslips (circles, 12 mm in diameter) in 24-well plates, one coverslip on each well, and coat each well with 250 µl of 0.5 mg/ml poly-D-lysine (in 100 mM borate buffer: 1.24 g boric acid and 1.90 g sodium tetraborate in 400 ml of deionized distilled H2O or ddH2O at pH 8.5) for over 10 hr at room temperature, sealed. Prepare around 10-12 coated coverslips per pup.",
    "On the day of dissection, collect neonatal brains from postnatal rat pups (1-4 postnatal day) after anesthetizing them with isoflurane, and decapitating. Anesthetize the pups in an anesthetization chamber containing isoflurane (2-4%). Wait until they lose consciousness and fail to respond to tactile stimuli and to pinching of the paws.\nUsing the standard technique26, dissect hippocampi from the brain in warm (~37 °C) saline (10 mM HEPES and 20 mM D-glucose added in Hank's balanced salt solution), and collect hippocampi in a conical tube with 4.5 ml warm saline.\nAdd 500 µl of 2.5% trypsin to the hippocampi (0.25% final trypsin concentration), and incubate for 10 min in a water bath at 37 °C.\nThoroughly rinse the tissue with saline (3 x 10 ml) and triturate.\nRecover the dissociated neurons in 1 ml warm growth media containing Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 21.2 mM D-glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 2% B-27, and 0.1% serum extender.\n\t\tNote: Add L-glutamine and B-27 on the day of dissection to prepare fresh growth media.\nCount the neurons with a hemocytometer, and plate them onto coverslips in 24-well plates at 1.0-1.5 x 105 cell/well density with 500 µl growth media after filtered through a 40 µm nylon mesh.\nIncubate the neuronal culture at 35 °C in a 5% CO2: 95% air humidified incubator for 2-3 weeks. For the best result, avoid disturbing the culture as much as possible during incubation.\nCalcium phosphate (Ca-P) Transfection of Primary Neuronal Culture\n\t\nMake stock solutions and store at 4 °C: 0.5 M BES (N,N-bis[2-hydroxy-ethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) buffer (10x); 150 mM Na2HPO4 (100x); 2.8 M NaCl (10x); sterile ddH2O; sterile 1 N NaOH.",
    "On the day of transfection, make fresh 2.5 M CaCl2 solution in ddH2O and sterile filter with 0.22 µm filter. Make fresh 2x BES-buffered Saline (BBS) buffer containing 50 mM BES, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4, and 280 mM NaCl at pH 7.00 (adjust pH with NaOH) and sterile filter with 0.22 µm filter.\n\t\tNote: Calculate the amount of CaCl2 solution and BBS buffer depending on the number of coverslips to be transfected. Also look at 1.3.4.\nReplace the culture growth media with 500 µl fresh pre-warmed transfection growth media. (Transfection media can be made with MEM plus 21.2 mM D-glucose).\n\t\tNote: Do not discard the old media.\nCalculate the amount of ddH2O and prepare to add in order to make the transfection solution (33 µl per each coverslip) containing 1.65 µl CaCl2, 0.7 µg DNA, and 16.5 µl 2x BBS.\nPrepare the transfection solution immediately before adding it to the culture. To prepare, first combine CaCl2 and ddH2O while slowly agitating the tube. Continue agitating and slowly add DNA into the solution. Lastly, add 2x BBS buffer drop-wise while agitating.\nImmediately add 30 µl of the transfection solution to each coverslip of neuronal culture.\nRock the culture dish a few times to mix the solution and incubate at 35 °C in a 5% CO2: 95% air humidified incubator for 45 min-1 hr. After neurons are incubated with the transfection solution, very fine Ca-P precipitates would form a layer covering neurons.",
    "Replace the transfection media with 500 µl pre-warmed washing buffer (135 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM glucose at pH 7.3, sterile filtered with 0.22 µm filter) and incubate at 35 °C in a 5% CO2: 95% air humidified incubator for 15-20 min. Ca-P precipitates would disappear after the wash step.\nReplace the washing buffer with 500 µl fresh growth media. Again, replace the growth media with the saved original media.\nAdd the Uaa Cmn (pre-mixed in 50 µl warm growth media) to the culture to reach 1 mM final concentration.\nIncubate the transfected culture at 35 °C in a 5% CO2: 95% air humidified incubator for 12-48 hr before assays.\nWhole Cell Recording with Light Activation\n\t\nPrepare extra/intracellular solutions. The intracellular solution contains 135 mM potassium gluconate, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 2.56 mM K2ATP, and 0.3 mM Li2GTP at pH 7.4. The extracellular recording solution contains 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7.4.\nSet up the electrophysiology rig for whole-cell patch clamping: microscope fitted with 4X and 20X objectives, differential interference contrast (DIC), and mCitrine filter (excitation: 495/10 nm, emission: 525/25 nm); manipulator; patch-clamp amplifier; digitizer; data acquisition and analysis software.\n\t\t\nInstall a light-emitting diode (LED) with emission of 385 nm by the microscope at the rig to deliver light to the focal point from 1 cm away at a 45° angle. Check the power of the LED with a light power meter.\nPull patch pipettes from glass electrodes using a commercial micropipette puller to have 3-6 MΩ pipette resistance. Follow manufacturer's instruction to set up the micropipette puller.",
    "To test pipette resistance, first fill the pipette with the intracellular solution and position it on the electrode holder. Dip the pipette in a 35 mm culture dish filled with the extracellular solution, placed on the microscope platform. Immerse a ground electrode into the dish to complete a circuit.\nTurn on the amplifier/digitizer and start a data acquisition software. Monitor pipette resistance with a membrane test protocol.\nTake out a coverslip of the neuron culture from the incubator and rinse once in the extracellular solution. Using vacuum grease, hold down the coverslip in the middle of a 35 mm culture dish filled with the fresh extracellular solution.\nPlace the coverslip/dish on the electrophysiology microscope platform.\nUsing the standard patch clamping techniques, patch a neuron with mCitrine fluorescence27. Record neuronal activity using current clamp (I-clamp) method. First, adjust the resting potential to around -72 mV by injecting a small current. Then, inject a step current (10-200 pA) to induce continuous firing (5-15 Hz) of action potentials.\nManually, or using the data acquisition software, flash a pulse (a single pulse of 100 msec-1 sec duration) of the LED light to the neuron while recording, and see if action potentials are affected.\nAdd 0.5 mM BaCl2 to the bath and verify if action potentials are recovered.\n2. Uaa Incorporation in Kir2.1 and Expression of the Resultant PIRK in the Mouse Embryonic Brain In Vivo\nDNA Construction\n\t\nDesign the plasmid DNA similarly as in step 1.1. For in vivo expression, use a strong promoter such as CAG (chicken beta-actin promoter with CMV enhancer).\nPurify DNA with an endotoxin-free maxiprep commercial kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Perform phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation25 to acquire extremely high quality DNA (condensed to 2-5 µg/µl).\nIn Utero Electroporation to the Mouse Embryonic Neocortex",
    "Note: The basic technique for in utero electroporation has been described previously28.\n\t\nAnesthetize a timed pregnant mouse at the embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) with sodium pentobarbital (intraperitoneal injection, 50 µg per gram body weight) or isoflurane (inhalation, 2-4%). Monitor anesthetic depth by checking loss of consciousness and no response to tactile stimuli and to pinching of the paws.\nMake a small incision at the abdominal midline. Gently expose the uterine horns with forceps and fingertips.\nInject about 1 µl DNA solution (2-5 µg/µl of each plasmid, depending on the construct) into the lateral ventricle of each littermate with a glass pipette inserted through the uterine wall. In most cases, about 60-80% of total embryos are injected.\nElectroporate the embryos with an electroporator (33-35 V, 50 msec duration, 950 msec interval, 4-8 pulses).\nReturn the uterine horns to the abdominal cavity gently with forceps and fingertips. Suture the muscle wall and then the skin with surgical suture to allow the embryos to continue development.\nUaa Microinjection\n\t\nMake a small incision at the abdominal midline again at E16.5, and gently expose the uterine horns with forceps and fingertips.\nInject about 2-5 µl Cmn-Ala (500 mM) to the electroporated side or both sides of the lateral ventricle with a glass pipette inserted through the uterine wall. To increase Cmn bioavailability, use the dipeptide Cmn-Ala (Cmn-alanine) to deliver Cmn in vivo21.\nAgain, return the uterine horns to the abdominal cavity gently with forceps and fingertips. Suture the muscle wall and then the skin with surgical suture to allow the embryos to continue development.\nObtain Acute Brain Slices\n\t\nMake 1 L artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, and 11 mM glucose at pH 7.3.",
    "Take 200 ml ACSF and fast-freeze at -80 °C for 20-30 min. Bubble the rest of ACSF with 5% CO2: 95% O2 gas at room temperature.\nPrepare and sterilize surgery tools to harvest brains from the embryos. Also prepare a bucket of ice.\nMake ~100 ml 4% low melting point agarose solution in a flask by heating in a microwave. Cool down solution for about 5 min before it starts to solidify.\nEuthanize the mouse 12-24 hr after Cmn-Ala injection by CO2 overdose. Make large incisions at the abdominal area, and dissect out the electroporated/microinjected embryos from the uterus with fine scissors and forceps.\nHarvest brains from the embryos with fine scissors and forceps.\nPlace each brain on a 10 cm culture dish placed on the ice bucket. Divide two hemispheres using a sharp blade, and place each hemisphere on the dish with the midsagittal plane touching the bottom of the dish. Quickly pour over the agarose solution over brains (around 500 µl per hemisphere).\nUsing a sharp blade, square cut the agarose around a brain to make a brain-embedded agarose block.\nUsing tissue adhesive, glue down the midsagittal plane surface of the agarose block on a mount for vibratome. Fill the vibratome chamber with pre-chilled ACSF and cut 200 µm sagittal brain slices.\nIncubate acute slices in ACSF supplemented with 3 mM myo-inositol, 0.4 mM ascorbic acid, and 2 mM sodium pyruvate at 33 °C for 42 min while bubbling with 5% CO2: 95% O2 gas.\nAfter 42 min, turn off the heater and continue to incubate the slices at room temp with bubbling. Start whole-cell patch recording at least 15 min after turning off the heater.\nWhole Cell Recording with Light Activation",
    "Prepare the intracellular solution containing 130 mM potassium gluconate, 4 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, 1.1 mM EGTA, 3.4 mM Na2ATP, 10 mM sodium creatine phosphate, and 0.1 mM Na3GTP at pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH.\nPull patch pipettes from glass electrodes using a commercial micropipette puller to have 3-6 MΩ pipette resistance.\nSet up the slice electrophysiology rig for whole-cell patch clamping and superfuse the recording chamber with ACSF at 2 ml/min rate with a perfusion pump. Adjust the chamber temperature to around 33 °C.\n\t\tNote: The slice electrophysiology rig is equipped with a perfusion chamber, a water immersion objective and a temperature controller. Also, GFP filter (excitation: 480/30 nm, emission: 535/40 nm) and mCherry filter (excitation: 580/20 nm emission: 675/130 nm) are required.\n\t\t\nInstall an LED with emission of 385 nm by the microscope at the rig to deliver light to the focal point from 1 cm away at a 45° angle. Check the power of the LED with a light power meter.\nCarefully pick up a brain slice with a glass pipette and place in the perfusion chamber. Hold down the slice with a harp.\nPatch a neuron with mCherry/GFP fluorescence from the neocortical region27. Record PIRK activity using voltage clamp (V-clamp) method. First, hold the membrane potential at -60 mV. Then, record currents at fixed negative membrane potentials (-100 mV) or voltage ramps (-100 mV to +40 mV). Specifically, monitor Kir2.1 specific inward currents at -100 mV.\nManually, or using the data acquisition software, flash a pulse (a single pulse of 100 msec-1 sec duration) of LED light to the neuron while recording, and see if PIRK proteins are activated. Once PIRK is activated, inward currents at -100 mV would increase significantly.\nAdd 0.5 mM BaCl2 to the bath and verify if PIRK is inactivated again.",
