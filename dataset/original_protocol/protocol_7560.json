    "Step 1. Participant screening Eligibility screeningProvide interested volunteers with a participant information sheet containing sections explaining eligibility criteria, procedures, and risks.Eligibility criteria: (i) age is between 18 and 45 years old; (ii) no history of medical, neurological, psychiatric, or substance use disorders; (iii) naïve to CWI (not exposed to cold water including cold shower, unheated swimming pool, or the sea) in the last 12–18 months, and (iv) free from chronic pain of any type (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4794/bioprotoc-13-17-4794-g001.jpgFigure 1. Participants selection consort diagram. The diagram provides information about the selection steps (on the left) and the number of participants excluded in each selection step.If required, screen participants by telephone interview and undertake any additional pre-screening tests required by the medical officer to rule out any significant history of medical, neurological, psychiatric, or substance use disorders.Claustrophobia screeningSiemens Lumina scanner has a relatively large tunnel, is fully lit, and is open at both ends. This dramatically lowers the experience of claustrophobia. Ask participants whether they have ever experienced claustrophobia (or fear of being in a closed space) in the past.Ask participants whether they have previous experience with MRI scans.Ask participants whether exposure to a feared situation have led to immediate anxiety or panic attacks in the past.If the answer is yes to a. or c., the participant does not pass claustrophobia screening.MRI compatibility screeningMRI compatibility screening should comply with the standard operation procedures approved for scanner use. The procedures can be slightly different across universities. Discuss the screening procedures with your local scanner manager.Ask participants to answer questions assessing their eligibility for fMRI study: (i) Do you have a heart pacemaker or pacing wires? (ii) Have you had any recent surgery? (iii) Have you had any surgery to your head (including eyes/ears/brain)? (iv) Do you have any implanted devices (e.g.",
    ", programmable hydrocephalus shunt, nerve stimulator, cochlea implant, aneurysm clip? (v) Have you ever sustained any injuries involving metal to your eyes or any parts of your body? (vi) Do you have any of the following: dentures with metal, body piercings, hearing aid, nitro patch, artificial limb or prothesis, tattoos? (vii) For women: do you have an IUD (coil)? Could you be pregnant?If the answer to all questions is no, the participant will be taken to the next screening step. If the answer to one or several questions is yes, take this case to a radiographer.Participants who passed Step 1 were scheduled to visit the Institute of Medical Imaging and Visualisation (IMIV) at Bournemouth University where the study took place. For the scheduled visit, ask participants to (i) refrain from eating food 2 h prior to the scanning session; (ii) bring a swimsuit/trunks or shorts (+vest top for women), a towel, a woollen jumper or sweatshirt with no metal, and slippers or flip flops.Step 2. Pre-CWI assessments MRI safety assessmentIf the participant passes the MRI safety assessment, explain the experimental procedures and familiarise participants with the setup, including cold-water tub and monitoring equipment.Answer any questions the participant may have and ask them to complete a written informed consent form.Pre-CWI mood assessmentProvide a printed version of the PANAS questionnaire and instruct them to evaluate all items of the questionnaire, reflecting on how they feel as they complete it (in the moment).Ask participants if they have any questions. Ensure that their clothes do not have any metal parts (or provide a set of scrubs and blankets).Step 3. Experimental procedures Pre-CWI scanPosition a participant in the scanner (Figure 2). Use MRI-compatible headphones to reduce scanner noise. Use pads to fixate the participant’s head to reduce head movements.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4794/bioprotoc-13-17-4794-g002.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Participant’s position in the scanner Provide an alarm button (by pressing the button, participants are able to stop the scanning at any time).Ask participants to keep awake and keep their eyes open.Start anatomical (structural) scan (4.5 min). Immediately after, start the functional scan (resting state) (13.12 min).After completing the pre-CWI scanning procedures, take the participant to a changing room to change into swimwear.CWI (cold-water immersion procedure)Record participant’s height and mass.Instrument with a three-lead ECG connected via ECG electrodes and waterproof the electrodes using Tegaderm dressings to improve the signal quality during immersion.Provide the participants with a nose clip and mouthpiece and ask them to breathe freely throughout.A minimum of 2 min of baseline data are collected on the Chart software with the participant seated next to the cold-water tank. The Chart program also collects water temperature, ECG, and ventilatory data throughout the immersion, and comments should be added to the chart software to highlight pre immersion, immersion, and post immersion phases.Participant will stand, immediately enter the tank, and be seated in the water within a 10–15 s period. They will immerse to the depth of the axilla (see image in Graphical overview). If the immersion is too deep, ask them to sit at the shallow part; if it is too shallow, ask them to sit in a deeper part. This is done by putting weights on the bottom, which the participants could sit on.Participants are encouraged to breathe freely through the mouthpiece and do not attempt to hold their breath.Monitor the ECG during immersion for any ECG abnormalities that would necessitate withdrawal from the cold water.Upon the completion of 5 min of immersion or if the participant requires earlier withdrawal, they stand up, exit the water tank onto a skid resistance surface, and the ECG and mouthpiece are removed.",
    "Participants remove their swimwear and dry off and dress in private, as quickly as possible.Record the duration of time from exiting the cold-water tub to the MRI chamber door closing, following the positioning of the participant in the scanner. The average time between exiting the cold-water tub and entering the scanner was M = 5.82 min, SD = 2.08 min (range: 2 min 25 s–10 min 30 s). It is not anticipated that the transition time between the tub and the scanner dramatically affects changes in the brain, as previous research reported the effects of CWI to last over a few days (Massey et al., 2022). However, we encouraged participants to dry off and dress quickly after the CWI. It must be noted that the cold-water tub should be set up as close to the MRI scanner as possible, to ensure the shortest transition time. In our study, the cold-water tub was next door to the scanner room.Post-CWI scanPosition the participant in the scanner (Figure 2).Use a lightweight cotton blanket to cover the participant’s body (to minimise shivering after CWI).Switch off the built-in scanner ventilator (to minimise participant cooling and body movement due to cold air).Immediately after, start the functional scan (resting state) (13.12 min).Table 1 summarises the timeline for the experimental steps to provide a detailed estimation of the complete study per participant at the MRU suite.Table 1.
