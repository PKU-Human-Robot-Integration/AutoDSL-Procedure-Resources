PX458 has Cas9 fused to GFP which is useful for the estimation of the transfection efficiency.\nVector digestion. Prepare the following reaction in an Eppendorf tube and incubate the reaction for 4 h at 37°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1192_1.csv\nPurify the digested vector after electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel using GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit (ThermoFischer Scientific) and elute in at least 25 μL elution buffer.\nRun small amount of undigested PX458 vector alongside the digested vector as comparison (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1192-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Agarose gel image of PX458\nAgarose gel image of undigested (left) and BbsI digested (right) PX458.\nMeasure the concentration of the digested vector and dilute to 100 ng/μL.\nsgRNA top/bottom oligos hybridization\nSet up the following reaction in 200 μL PCR tube, and incubate at 95°C for 5 min and then ramp down to 25°C at 5°C/ min. As controls, use only one oligo as a negative control (sgRNA hybridization) and water for the re-ligation control (PX458).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1192_2.csv\nNote: In case the vector is dephosphorylated, phosphorylate the oligos in the same PCR tube by addition of 0.5 μL T4 PNK (NEB) and incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes before heating it at 95°C for 5 minutes. For phosphorylation, use only T4 ligation buffer, not the PNK buffer supplied with T4 PNK enzyme. This is because the PNK buffer doesn’t contain ATP.\nDilute the hybridized sgRNA 1:200 in ddH2O.\nLigation and transformation\nPrepare the following reaction, incubate the tube for 60 min at 22°C and then for 10 min at 65°C for heat inactivation of the ligase. Use re-ligation and single oligo hybrid as negative controls.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1192_3.csv\nTransformation",
    "Add 5 μl ligation mixture to 50 μL E. coli XL1 blue strain or any other competent E. coli strain.\nIncubate for 15 min on ice.\nHeat shock the cells at 42°C for 45 s, followed by incubation on ice for 3 min.\nAdd 500 μL LB medium and regenerate for 30 min at 37°C with shaking.\nSpin down the cells at 800 × g for 2 min and resuspend in 100 μL of LB medium.\nPlate the cells in ampicillin or carbenicillin containing agar plates, and incubate at 37°C for 16–18 h .\nCritical: Count the colony numbers. Usually, the ratio between colonies in the sgRNA ligation plate and control plate is >50. If the desired ratio is not observed repeat the hybridization and/or ligation again.\nPick 3–4 single colonies, carry out plasmid extraction (miniprep) and send the plasmid for sequencing (using ASK-FN2 as primer) to check the presence of sgRNA.\nPerform maxiprep using PureLink™ HiPure Plasmid Maxiprep Kit or other kit according to manufacturer protocol to obtain the sgRNA plasmid.\nHDR plasmid cloning\nClone the gBlock ordered into pJET1.2/blunt vector using CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Scientific) using the manufacturer protocol to generate the entry vector.\nExtract genomic DNA from the cell line of interest.\nPrepare lysis buffer for genomic DNA extraction. The buffer can be stored at 25°C, for two years.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1192_4.csv\nMix the cells with 500 μL lysis buffer in Eppendorf tube and incubate at 37°C for 2 h.\nAdd 250 μL saturated saline solution, vortex for approximately 20 s and incubate on ice for 20 min.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 5000× g at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant into new tube, add 10 μg Glycogen and 650 μL isopropanol, and incubate for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.",
    "Centrifuge at 14000× g for 10 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nWash the pellet with 70 % ethanol.\nAir dry the pellet and dissolve it in ddH2O to obtain the genomic DNA.\nNote: Alternatively, any kit can be used for genomic DNA extraction.\nPerform PCR using the primers for the amplification of the Homology arm (right, RHA and left, LHA) using genomic DNA as a template.\nClone the amplified fragments in pJET1.2, prepare minis and send for sequencing to check if the HA is correctly amplified.\nDigest the entry vector to remove the knock-in cassette (tag-selection marker) using RS3/RS4 and to prepare the vector backbone using RS1/RS5.\nDigest the LHA and RHA with correct set of restriction enzymes from the mini-prep plasmid and clone into the entry vector using a triple ligation (molar ratio RHA: LHA: knock-in cassette: empty vector backbone = 4: 4: 3: 1) with 50 ng of entry vector backbone.\nTransform the ligated mixture into competent E. coli cells.\nInoculate minis for 5–6 colonies, perform miniprep and digest them to check the inserts. Send few minis to confirm the sequence (using pJET1.2-F and pJET1.2-R as primers).\nFinally inoculate the mini with correct sequence for maxi and perform maxiprep to obtain the HDR plasmid.\nNote: It has been observed that the HDR plasmids could have different sequence to the one found on GenBank or UCSC browser, but as long as you observe the same mutations in more than one mini’s clones (pJET-HDR) and it is not leading to missense/non-sense mutations in the CDS of the protein of interest, it might be a natural variation to the UCSC sequence for that particular cell line.\nTransfection and selection of single cell clones\nTiming: 21 days\nAfter obtaining the required plasmids, carry out transfection.",
    "Seed 1–1.5× 106 cells per 10 cm or 1–2× 105 cells per 6 well plate evening before transfection. The cell numbers might vary with cell type. These above numbers are for U2OS cells\nCritical: As the cells will not be split until 72 hours post transfection, cell seeding must be optimized accordingly for other cell types.\nPrepare the following DNA and polyethyleneimine (PEI) mixture in two separate tubes for each of the following transfection with the DNA amount required for 10 cm dish.\nPositive selection control: Plasmid with resistance marker (Blasticidin in our case)\nKnock-in mix for each sgRNA: 3 μg PX458 (sgRNA-plasmid) + 9 μg (HDR plasmid)\nCRISPR control (to check random cutting): 5 μg PX458 (sgRNA-plasmid)\nHDR control (to check random integration): 5 μg HDR plasmid\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1192_5.csv\nVortex both mixtures, incubate for 10 min, add DNA-Mix to PEI-Mix dropwise, mix by pipetting and incubate for 20 min.\nRemove the medium from the cells, wash the cells twice with PBS and add 6 mL (10 cm dish) or 1.2 mL (6-well plate) transfection media (supplemented with 2% FCS, NO antibiotics). Finally add the DNA-PEI-Mix dropwise to the cells.\nWash the cells 2× with PBS after 6 h of transfection and add 10 mL (10 cm dish) or 2 mL (6-well plate) full medium (supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% Pen/Strep).\nMonitor the cell confluency and the GFP expression (GFP present in PX458) to judge the transfection efficiency (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) over the next days.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1192-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Transfection efficiency of U2OS cells\nGFP expression in U2OS cells 51 h after transfection of the PX458 plasmid containing sgRNA along with HDR plasmid. HDR only plasmid is a control. Scale bar: 200 μm.",
    "After 72 h of transfection, select the cells. For selection, trypsinize the cells and plate them in 15 cm dish with 20 mL media containing 7.5 μg/mL Blasticidin for all. Divide knock-in cells i.e., with sgRNA-plasmid and HDR into 5 plates serial diluting with various ratios (1:1000, 1:500, 1:100, 1:20, remaining cells for 10 cm dish or 1:500, 1:200, 1:50, and remaining cells for 6-well plate) into 15 cm dish with Blasticidin. For controls, do not prepare serial dilution plate, instead transfer all cells to 15 cm dish.\nRefresh the media with antibiotics every 48 h. Check the negative control and continue selection until all negative control cells are dead. For U2OS with Blasticidin 6 days selection works.\nWhen negative selection controls are dead, wash the knock-in cells with PBS (do it slowly to avoid cell detachment and mixing of clones) and put fresh medium and change medium as frequently as you would do in normal cell culture.\nNote: In the plates with knock-in cells, a lot of cells will die, which is normal and expected.\nOnce single colonies are observed, they should be allowed to grow and reach a size where they are visible by naked eyes by looking from bottom of the plate (usually within 10 days).\nSingle clone picking and expansion\nTiming: 7 days\nOnce the single clones are visible with naked eyes, transfer single colonies to 24 well plates using cloning rings. Mark each colony with a marker at the bottom of the plate and confirm by seeing under microscope. Usually from one 15 cm, do not mark more than 40 clones due to time constraints because the colonies dry very fast (see next steps).",
    "Critical: Only mark the colonies separated by approximately 0.5–1 cm from each other. If the colonies are near to each other, there is chance of picking both colonies into same well. Also, colonies are better visible if you remove the media, wash once with PBS, and leave cells in PBS. It will be easier to mark the colonies.\nRemove the medium and wash with PBS. Take autoclaved cloning ring using sterilized forceps (with 70% ethanol followed by flaming it with Bunsen-burner) and put in sterilized Vaseline so that the bottom of the ring is coated with thin layer of Vaseline.\nTake the cloning ring and carefully place it so that the colony is in the center of the ring (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). Use another cloning ring to press the cloning ring downwards so that it seals with the bottom of the plate. Repeat the same for all colonies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1192-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Single clone picking using cloning rings\n(A) Representative image for picking single clone, (B) cloning ring, and (C) cloning rings placed with colony in center for trypsinization.\nNote: We used self-made metal cloning ring, but it can also be bought from different vendors (Fischer scientific; catalog number 09-552-20).\nOnce all cloning rings are placed, add 50 μL of trypsin in each and incubate for 20 min at 20°C–22°C or at 37°C.\nNote: U2OS cells tolerate 20 minutes in trypsin. However, for other cell lines use shorter incubation of 5–8 minutes or precheck the trypsinization time for your cell type.\nDuring trypsinization, prepare 24 well plate with 1 mL medium each.\nTake 100 μL media from each well and add on the cloning rings with trypsinized cells to resuspend them.\nTransfer the cell suspension with trypsin into the 24 well plate and label them properly. Repeat the same for all.",
    "Leave the cells to attach 16–18 h and then change the medium next day.\nOnce the cells reach confluency, split them, and take about 0.8× for genotype screening and the rest for maintenance.\nIdentification of positive clones\nTiming: 7 days\nExtract the genomic DNA from the cells and carryout the PCR using the screening primers with genomic DNA as template for 28 cycles. Homozygous, heterozygous and wildtype or no knock-in clones should have one, two and one bands respectively (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1192-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Screening of the knock-in clones using the screening primers\nScreening of clones using screening primers set 1 (cSPT6_2055_F and cSPT6_2055_R). The PCR products of heterozygous, homozygous, wild type or no knock-in clones is labeled.\nCheck the correct integration by Sanger sequencing the integration site.\nSelect at least two clones which showed homozygous band in screening PCR for sequencing.\nGel extract and clone the PCR fragment into pJET1.2 using kit, perform miniprep and sequence using pJET1.2-F and pJET1.2-R.\nCheck the clones, not only by the sequence, but carefully observe the chromatogram (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]) for any small peaks which might be worrisome. Make sure to check all the junctions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1192-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Chromatogram from Sanger sequencing\nChromatogram of the homozygous U2OS C-terminally tagged SPT6 with AID using the screening primer set 1 (shown in Narain et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] as chromatogram for U2OSSPT6-AID-C1).\nFinally, for the clones with correct sequence at the insertion site, extract protein and perform western blots.\nIncubate the whole membrane with preferentially 2 antibodies recognizing N- and C- terminal.\nAdditionally, an antibody recognizing the epitope introduced during knock-in can also be used. It is important to see if there are any truncated proteins or random products."
