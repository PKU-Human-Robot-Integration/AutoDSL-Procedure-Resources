    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: If the same samples are used for both red blood cell (RBC) lysis and PBMCs isolation, the samples should be divided into 2 aliquots. The volumes depend on the amount of the starting material and ought to be adjusted to meet the requirement for next experiments.\nRed blood cell lysis\nTiming: 25 min\nIn this section, procedures for RBC lysis are described. RBC lysis is performed in whole blood samples from healthy volunteers prior to identification of HLA-A2 by using flow cytometry.\nCritical: RBC lysis and buffer—Sterilized by filtration through 0.22 μm filter.\nPrepare the RBC lysis solution\nRBC lysis\nManipulate the blood tube in the biological hood, and gently transfer 1 mL blood (About 1 × 106 PMBCs) to a 15 mL microcentrifuge tube\nAdd 10 mL RBC lysis buffer carefully by using a serological pipette\nVortex the microcentrifuge tube briefly and put it still for 10 min at 25°C\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant and add 15 mL BSM buffer, repeat centrifugation as in step d\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 100 μL BSM buffer\nCount viable cells and adjust to 5–10 × 106 cells/mL with BSM buffer, and distribute cell suspension into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with 100 μL/tube (5–10 ×105 cells/tube, at least 2 tubes)\nCell staining and flow cytometric analysis\nTiming: 1 h\nBlock Fc-receptors Human TruStain includes specialized human IgG that binds to Fc receptors through the Fc terminal of the antibodies. Human TruStain is compatible with flow cytometry staining with anti-human CD64 (clone 10.1), CD32 (clone FUN-2), and CD16 (clone 3G8) antibodies. The reagents blocking the Fc receptors may help to reduce non-specific immunofluorescent staining.",
    "Add 5 μL Human TruStain FcX™ per million cells in 100 μL staining volume, mix and incubate for 10 min at 25°C\nNote: There is no need to wash cells between these blocking and immunostaining steps.\nCell-Surface staining with PE anti-human HLA-A2 antibody HLA-A2 is the most dominant MHC class I subtype in population in North America and Northern Asia. MHC class I heavy chain and β2-microglobulin are expressed on all human nucleated cells.\nFor flow cytometric staining, it is ssuggested to use 5 μL reagent per million cells in a 100 μL staining volume, and incubate on ice for 20 min in the dark\nWash twice with 1.5 mL cell staining buffer by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nResuspend cell pellet in 200 μL cell staining buffer and add 5 μL/million cells of 7-AAD viability staining solution to exclude dead cells\nIncubate on ice for 3–5 min in the dark\nPerform flow cytometric analysis\nPause point: If you cannot read your samples immediately on a flow cytometer, keep them foil wrapped and in a refrigerator at 4°C–8°C for less than 4 hours. The samples should be resuspended in cell staining buffer. It is worth noting that the samples should not remain in a fixation buffer for a long time, which will affect fluorophore conformation and fluorescence.\nIsolation of human PBMCs (density gradient centrifugation)\nTiming: 1 h",
    "In this section, the procedures from PBMCs isolation from whole blood of healthy volunteers are described. These healthy volunteers enrolled in Guangzhou Blood Center and confirmed with a negative report for SARS-CoV-2 RNA real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. These donors had no known history of any significant systemic diseases, including, but not limited to, hepatitis B or C, HIV, diabetes, kidney or liver diseases, malignant tumors, or autoimmune diseases. The average yield of whole blood per mL was 1–2 × 106 cells PBMCs. Lymphocyte Separation Medium (LSM) is designed for the rapid, simple isolation of lymphocytes from diluted defibrinated whole blood layered on a solution of Ficoll® and centrifuged at low speed (805 × g) for 20 min. Blood cells migrate through the solution during centrifugation to form density-specific layers. Lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells form a unique band between LSM fractions and the plasma (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Lymphocytes are retrieved by aspirating the plasma layer and then removing the cells. Excess plasma, platelets, and LSM can then be removed by cell washing. To achieve the best results, use blood drawn within two hours. Blood drawn more than 24 h before should not be used.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/979-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Isolation of human PBMCs and EasySep™ human CD8+ T cells selection\n(A) Isolation of human PBMCs.\n(B) EasySep™ human CD8+ T cells selection.\nPreparation of the necessary materials\nPrewarm the LSM at 25°C and thoroughly mix it by gently flipping the bottle. For each sample (4 mL heparinized blood, 1–2 × 106 cells/mL), fill one 15 mL Falcon tube with 4 mL LSM and another one with 4 mL PBS\nProperly label the tubes, including sample ID, PBS, LSM etc.\nDensity-gradient centrifugation\nMix 4 mL heparinized blood with 4 mL PBS (equal volume of heparinized blood and PBS)",
    "Carefully LAYER the diluted blood over the 4 mL LSM in the 15 mL centrifuge tube, creating a distinct blood-LSM interface\nDO NOT MIX! The quality of separation depends on the distinct interface between the diluted blood and density gradient\nCentrifuge the tube at 805 × g for 20 min at 25°C\nNote: For PBMCs separation, the speeds of acceleration and brake are set 0.\nAfter centrifugation, open the centrifugation bucket in the hood to get the Falcon; PBMCs are carefully retrieved into the 15 mL Falcon pre-filled with PBS by using a 2 mL serological pipette\nNote: The volume of PBS should be twice as the expected PBMCs fraction, and adjust the final volume accordingly.\nCritical: Avoid mixing of density phases to prevent the contamination from red blood cells and granulocytes.\nWash cells twice with 10 mL PBS by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C\nNote: Washing the cells removes LSM and decreases the amount of platelets.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the PBMCs (1 × 106 cells/mL) in the desired volume of primary T cell medium\nCryopreservation of PBMCs samples\nTiming: 15 min\nIn the present section, the procedures for long-term storage of PBMCs for T cell activation later are described. Cells are resuspended in cell freezing medium containing DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen.\nPrepare required media and equipment\nCell freezing medium\nMedium for primary T cells\nChilled cell freezing container\nChilled cryovials\nCryopreservation protocol\nLabel cryovials properly, and put them on ice in the biological safety cabinet\nCentrifuge the isolated PBMCs at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C\nResuspend the cells in a suitable volume of cell freezing medium to make a cell concentration of 2–10 × 106 cells/mL (keep the cells on ice)\nMix the cell suspension gently",
    "Transfer 1 mL cell suspension into the cryovials on ice\nTransfer the cryovials into the pre-chilled cell freezing container\nPlace the container in a −80°C freezer for a minimum of 12 h\nTransfer the cryovials to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage\nHuman CD8+ T-cell isolation\nTiming: 8 min\nIn this section, high purity CD8+ T cells are isolated from fresh or frozen human PBMCs by immunomagnetic negative selection. Non-CD8+ T cells are recognized by antibodies specific to their cell surface markers, and labeled with magnetic beads, which help to remove these cells by using an EasySep™magnet. Starting with a single cell suspension of human PBMCs, the CD8+ T cell content of the isolated fraction is typically 98.6% (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). The wanted CD8+ T cells are then transferred into a new tube, and can be used immediately for downstream applications such as culture and flow cytometry.\nNote: Yield of CD8+ T cell isolation can greatly vary depending if they are isolated from fresh blood or frozen PBMCs. If derived from fresh blood, CD8+ T cells (about 15%–30% of PBMCs) are more than 95% viability. If derived from frozen PBMCs, CD8+ T cells (about 10%–25% of PBMCs) are more than 90% viability.\nPreparation of required media and equipment\nPBMCs suspension\nNote: Incubate the frozen PBMCs with 100 μg/mL Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I solution for at least 15 min at 25°C before labeling and separation. Filter the cell suspension with 37 μm cell filters to obtain optimal results.\nNote: DNase I solution is useful to reduce or prevent the clumping of concentrated and/or cryopreserved cell suspensions following thawing.\n5 mL polystyrene round-bottom\nEasySep™ Magnet\nCD8+ T cells isolation protocol\nPrepare cell suspension at 5 × 107 cells/mL in optimum EasySep™ buffer\nCritical: EasySep™ Buffer—This buffer should be free of Ca++ and Mg++.",
    "Add samples to 5 mL polystyrene round-bottom tubes\nAdd isolation cocktail to sample, 50 μL/mL of sample volume\nMix and incubate at 25°C for 5 min\nVortex RapidSpheres™, put at 25°C for 30 s\nNote: Beads should evenly dispersed.\nAdd RapidSpheres™ to sample and mix, 50 μL/mL of sample volume\nAdd propriate amount of EasySep™ buffer to top up to 2.5 mL. Mix by gently pipetting up and down for 2–3 times\nPlace the tube (without lid) into the magnet and incubate at 25°C for 3 min\nPick up the magnet, and in one continuous movement invert the magnet and tube, pouring the enriched cell suspension into a new tube\nCritical: Keep the magnet and tube inverted for 2–3 seconds, then return upright. Don't shake or wipe off any drops that may remain hanging from the tube orifice.\nCentrifuge the purified CD8+ T cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the CD8+ T cells in the desired volume of primary T cell medium\nActivation of CD8+ T cells\nTiming: ∼7 days\nOnce the human CD8+ T cells have been isolated in step 10, they will be stimulated in a primary culture in order to induce the production of specific CD8+ T cells and cytokines.\nPreparation of required media and equipment\nT2-A2 cells\nMedium for T2-A2 cells\nCandidate peptides (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1])\nMitomycin C\nCFSE\nIL-2\nAnti-human CD28 antibody\nClear 6-well TC-treated microplates\n96-well TC-treated microplates\nMitomcyin C ( 20 μg/mL) pretreatment of T2-A2 cells Mitomycin C induces cross-linking of the double-stranded DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis, triggering DNA repair events, and inducing apoptosis. The aminoquinone group in mitomcyin C contributes to the inhibition of DNA synthesis.",
    "Critical: Mitomycin C—To get higher solubility, please warm the tube at 37°C and shake it in an ultrasonic bath for a while.\nHarvest T2-A2 cells from T-75 cell culture flasks by agitation and aspiration using a 10 mL serological pipette, or equivalent. Cells are then transferred to a fresh 15 mL Falcon.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in complete IMDM to a final concentration of approximately 1–2 × 106 cells/mL\nTransfer the T2-A2 cells in 2 mL/well into the 6-well plate, add mitomycin C (20 μg/mL) per well, and incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 30 min\nWash twice with PBS and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nNote: The solubility of mitomycin C in DMSO is >16.7 mg/mL. To get higher solubility, warm the tube at 37°C and shake it in an ultrasonic bath for a while. Stock solution can be stored foil wrapped below −20°C for up to 6 months.\nCarboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) transfected with T2-A2 cells CFSE is a fluorescent dye with cellular permeability. It is covalently coupled with intracellular molecules, especially lysine residues and other amine sources, through its succinimide group. The binding of CFSE to cells is stable. It has no toxicity and will not alter the viability of labeled cells. CFSE persists in cells for 24 h after labeling, thus is suitable for long term detection of labeled cells (Xiao et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). In the process of cell division and proliferation, its fluorescence intensity decreases gradually with the cell division. The labeled fluorescence can be equally distributed to the two daughter cells, so their fluorescence intensity is half of the parental cells.",
    "Critical: CFSE—Freshly prepared or make small aliquots and store at −80°C for up to 2 years.\nNote: The concentration mentioned here is safe (≤5 μM ). However, high concentration of CFSE (FITC) might toxic to T cells.\nThe CFSE stock solution (5 mM) in DMSO is diluted to a final concentration of 5 μM in PBS with a total volume of 1 mL\n2–4 × 108 T2-A2 cells are resuspended with 1 mL PBS, mixed with 1 μL 5 mM CFSE ( final concentration is 5 μM ), and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 min with agitation\nThe labeling reaction is stopped for 10 min by adding 9 mL complete IMDM\nThe CFSE labeled cells are washed twice with PBS and recounted, and the cell concentration is adjusted to 5 × 106 cells/mL in serum-free IMDM\nNote: To get higher solubility, warm the tube at 37°C and shake it in an ultrasonic bath for a while.\nPeptide screening in T2A2 cells To validate the predicted epitopes, first check if they can be presented by HLA-A2 on the antigen presenting cells. T2A2 is an antigen-presenting cell lacking antigen peptide transporter and expressing HLA-A2 on the cell surface. The peptide-MHC complex would be more stabilized if the epitopes bind with HLA-A2 suitably.\nThe candidate peptides (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) are synthesized in GenScript Biotechnology and dissolved in DMSO at the concentration of 10 mM.\nT2A2 cells are seeded into 96-well plates with 105 cells in 200 μL per well, and then incubated with peptides at a final concentration of 20 μM at 37°C for 4 h, respectively.\nActivation of CD8+ T cells\nHarvest peptide loaded T2-A2 cells from step 14 and mix all cells together\nCentrifuge cells at 400 × g for 5 min at 4°C",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in primary T cell medium to a final concentration of approximately 2.5 × 106 cells/mL\n0.5 × 106 CD8+ T cells isolated from healthy donors and 0.5 × 106 peptide loaded T2-A2 cells are mixed and seeded into 96-well plates with 200 μL/well. Add 1 μg/mL anti-CD28 antibody and 50 IU/mL IL-2 into each well, and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2\nEvery two days, 50 μL old medium is carefully taken along the 96-well plate wall and discarded, and 50 μL fresh T cell culture medium containing 50 IU/mL IL-2 and 20 μM mixed peptide is added\nNote: When transfer the 96-well plate from the incubator, avoid shaking and carefully move it out of the incubator to prevent the cells from floating on the surface of the medium.\nThe T cell activation marker CD69 and tetramer specific CD8+ T cells are evaluated after 16 h and 7 days, respectively\nCell-Surface staining with APC anti-human CD69 CD69 is transiently expressed on activated leukocytes including T, B, and NK cells. CD69 is involved in early events of lymphocyte, platelet, and monocyte activation, and plays a role in redirected lysis mediated by activated NK cells.\nNote: The T cell activation marker CD69 was evaluated after 16 hours.\nTransfer the 96-well plates from the incubator to the hood. Mix the cells in each well and transfer 30 μL cell (1 × 106 cells) suspension into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes\nAdd 5 μL Human TruStain FcX™ per million cells in 100 μL staining volume, mix and incubate at 25°C for 10 min\nNote: There is no need to wash cells between these blocking and immunostaining steps.",

It can be used to detect the antigen-specific T cells. So, SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T cells can be directly detected with corresponding tetramers, unlike the indirect detection methods such as cytokine assay. Moreover, it can be applied for cell sorting. It enables detailed phenotypical and functional analysis of T cells.\nTransfer cells from each well into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend each pellet with 100 μL cold cell staining buffer by gentle swirling\nIt is recommended to add 5 μL Human TruStain FcX™ per million cells in 100 μL staining volume, mix and incubate at 25°C for 10 min\nNote: It is not necessary to wash cells between these blocking and immunostaining steps.\nAdd 2 μL per sample of corresponding Flex-T™ complex prepared in \"before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]\" steps 1–2, mix and incubate in the dark for 1 h at 25°C\nAdd 2 μL APC labeled human CD8+ (clone T8), mix and incubate in the dark for 30 min at 4°C",

Visualization of representative flow cytometry data and gating strategy\n(A) MHC tetramer staining of human CD8+ T cells.\n(B) Intracellular cytokine (IFN-γ and Granzyme B) staining.\nCritical: When perform MHC tetramer staining with anti-CD8 antibody in flow cytometry, you need to choose correct CD8 clones to gain the best results. A wrong CD8 clone may lead to undesired reactions on MHC tetramer binding to the TCR, either enhancing or reducing tetramer reaction (Campanelli et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] ). We strongly recommend clones T8, Hit8a or MCD8 for human MHC tetramer staining. Also make sure the correct protocol is followed.\nIntracellular cytokine (IFN-γ and Granzyme B) staining\nTiming: ∼8 h\nActivated cell populations can be generated from in vitro-stimulated cultures or from in vivo-stimulated tissues (e.g., antigen-specific activation). The Leukocyte Activation Cocktail, with BD GolgiPlug™ is a ready-to-use polyclonal cell activation mixture including the phorbol ester, a calcium ionophore (Ionomycin), the protein transport inhibitor BD GolgiPlug™ (Brefeldin A) and Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA). Primary cytokine responses by T cells can be induced with this mixture. Since Brefeldin A blocks the intracellular protein transport processes, the produced cytokines will be localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the cytokine producing cells. Thus, these cells are readily detected by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analysis due to the accumulation of the increased expression of cytokines.",
    "Cell-Surface staining with APC anti-human CD8\nOn day 7, quickly thaw the cocktail in a water bath at 37°C and add 2 μL Leukocyte Activation Cocktail to 1 mL cell culture (e.g., ∼106 cells/mL) and mix thoroughly\nCulture in CO2 incubator at 37°C for 6 h\nCritical: It is suggested not to keep Leukocyte Activation Cocktail with BD GolgiPlug in a cell culture for more than 12 hours.\nNote: Store product at −80°C before use or for long-term storage.\nHarvest cells from each well into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 100 μL cold cell staining buffer by gentle swirling\nIt is recommended to add 5 μL of Human TruStain FcX™ per million cells in 100 μL staining volume, mix and incubate at 25°C for 10 min\nAdd 2 μL APC labeled human CD8+, mix and incubate in the dark for 30 min at 4°C\nWash once with at least 1.5 mL cell staining buffer by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C\nNote: Some antibodies to surface markers of natural cells may not recognize fixed/denatured antigens. Therefore, it is suggested to stain cell surface antigens with live and unfixed cells before cell fixation/permeabilization and intracellular staining.\nFixation Stain the cell surface antigens as described in step 18, then fix cells in 0.5 mL/tube Fixation Buffer in the dark for 20 min at 25°C Tip: For mild fixation (especially with tandem fluorophore), FluoroFix™ Buffer (BioLegend Cat# 422101) can be used.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and discard supernatant",
    "Pause point: To hold the experiment at this point for future staining and analysis, wash cells with Cell Staining Buffer. Re-suspend the cells in Cell Staining Buffer, and store at 4°C for a short time, and stored at −80°C in a cell cryopreservation solution for a long time (fixed cells without surface antigen staining). Alternatively, cells can be kept in Cyto-Last™ Buffer for the storage of cytokine-producing cells for up to 2 weeks. The frequencies of cytokine-producing cells present in activated human PBMCs cultures may be very different due to the donor variability. For this reason, cryopreserved cells from a single donor can be used for longitudinal studies.\nPermeabilization\nDilute 10 × permeabilization wash buffer stock solution to 1 × in sterile nuclease-free ddH2O\nResuspend fixed cells in Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5–10 min\nRepeat step b twice\nIntracellular staining (IFN-γ and Granzyme B) Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and Granzyme B are potent multifunctional cytokines, mainly secreted by activated NK cells and T cells. Originally characterized based on anti-viral activities, IFN-γ also play a role in proinflammatory, immunoregulatory, and anti-proliferative activities. Granzyme B exerts crucial functions to induce rapid apoptosis and cell death.\nResuspend fixed/permeabilized cells in residual Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer and add a predetermined optimum concentration of fluorophore-conjugated antibody of interest (PerCP-IFN-γ and FITC-Granzyme B, 5 μL/tests ), incubate for 20 min at 25°C in the dark\nWash twice with 1.5 mL of Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min\nNote: It is required to carry out fluorophore conjugated streptavidin incubation if primary intracellular antibody is biotinylated, and subsequent washes in Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer.",
    "Resuspend the fixed and intracellular labeled cells with 0.2 mL cell staining buffer and perform flow cytometric analysis, representative data and a gating strategy are shown in (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B)\nNote: Set photomultiplier tube voltage and compensation using cell surface staining controls. Set quadrant markers based on isotype controls, unstained cells or blocking controls. To perform appropriate flow cytometric analysis, the cells stained with this method should be examined by optical microscope and/or flow light scattering mode to confirm that they are well dispersed. Bivariate dot plots or probability contour plots can be generated by data analysis to show the frequencies and patterns by which individual cells demonstrate co-expression of a certain level of cell surface antigen and intracellular cytokine proteins."
