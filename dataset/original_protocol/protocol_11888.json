    "The research techniques used during this study were approved by the institutional review boards (IRB) of Duke University and the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill.\n1. Imaging Task Design\nGenerate an event-based behavioral task that presents infrequent target stimuli (a circle) within a sequence of more-frequent standard stimuli (scrambled images). A schematic of the task is shown in Figure 1. Present the task using CIGAL software10.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51484/51484fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic of Task Design.

IAPS images are rated on a scale of 1-9 in order to reflect levels of arousal and valence11. High numbers indicate higher positive valence and arousal. Select a set of images that are age-appropriate to the study group such as pictures of snakes, spiders, or other animals.\n\tNote: The task-irrelevant aversive stimuli images used for this study had an average valence rating of 3.38 (S.D. = 1.78) and an average arousal rating of 6.14 (S.D. = 2.08). The neutral stimuli images had an average valence of 6.21 (S.D. = 0.26) and an average arousal rating of 3.72 (S.D. = 2.15).\nProgram the task script such that images are presented in a pseudo-randomized order for 1,500 msec with a 500 msec mean inter-stimulus interval. Present target stimuli and task-irrelevant neutral images no more frequently than every 15 sec and make each about 4% of the stimuli. Jitter event onset times in order to provide better resolution of the hemodynamic response function.",
    "Create 8 sets of images, one for each of 8 functional runs such that the participants are presented with a total of 40 targets and 40 task-irrelevant neutral images over the course of all 8 runs.\n2. Participant Setup and Scanning\nRecruit children and adolescents between the ages of 9 and 18 who are either healthy control individuals or who are at familial high risk for psychosis.\n\t\nEnsure that healthy individuals have no psychiatric illnesses or any first-degree family members with a psychiatric illness. Ensure that familial risk participants have at least one first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with schizophrenia. Do not exclude them for the presence of other psychiatric illnesses in first-degree relatives.\nAge and gender match healthy participants with familial risk group participants.\nAcquire informed consent from participants over the age of 18. For minors, acquire informed consent from parents/legal guardians. Additionally, acquire written assent from minors who are taking part in the study.\nPlace the participants in a mock MRI scanner in order to familiarize them with the environment. Play an audio recording of scanner noise and have them complete a practice run of the behavioral task in order to ensure that they understand the task instructions.\nPlace the participant in the MRI Scanner and acquire any necessary brain localization scans and/or anatomical images.\nUsing an MRI-safe input box, tell participants to press one button with their index finger in response to all target stimuli and another button with their middle finger for all other stimuli.\nFollowing fMRI scanning, collect subjective ratings of arousal and valence for the images used in the study from a subset of participants. The current study obtained ratings from 15 controls and 13 with familial high risk.\n3. Image Acquisition",
    "Place participants into a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner. First, acquire a set of structural images including a 3D coplanar anatomical T1-contrast image using a spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition pulse sequence (TR: 5.16 msec; TE: 2.04 msec; FOV: 24 cm; image matrix: 256 × 256; Flip Angle: 20; voxel size: 0.94 mm × 0.94 mm × 1.9 mm; 68 axial slices).\nAcquire functional imaging data using a gradient echo echo-planar imaging sequence with full-brain coverage (TR: 2,000 msec; TE: 27 msec; FOV: 24 cm; image matrix: 64 × 64; Flip Angle: 60; voxel size: 3.75 mm × 3.75 mm × 3.8 mm; 34 axial slices) so that brain activity can be measured during the performance of the behavioral task. Run this imaging sequence for each run of the behavioral task. Each run should consist of 120 imaging time points.\nPresent the task in 8 functional runs, each lasting approximately 4 min.\n4.
