  "procedures": [
    "All experimental procedures mentioned in the following protocol were approved by the Thuringian state authorities (Thüringer Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz, Reg.-Nr. 02-044/12).\n1. Preparations for Experiment\nFabrication of suction electrodes\n\t\nPull a micropipette using a standard borosilicate glass capillary with a micropipette puller, e.g. a standard patch electrode.\nBrake the electrode to tip diameter of 0.5-1 mm (slightly larger than the diameter of the dorsal roots) using a diamond file.\nHeat polish the tip so it will not harm the dorsal root when it is sucked in. A standard lab torch will be suitable.\nMount the glass filament on an electrode holder connected to a syringe through which negative pressure can be applied.\nPreparation of solutions\n\t\nInjection anesthesia for mice: Mix 0.75 ml ketamine 10%, 0.24 ml xylazine 2% and 5 ml 0.9% saline. 10 µl/g bodyweight (BW) of the solution will be injected intraperitoneally (i.p.).\nArtificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF): Dilute in double distilled water the following salts (in mM): NaCl 134; KCl 3; KH2PO4 1.25; MgSO4•H2O 2; NaHCO3 25; CaCl2 2; D-glucose 10. Add H2O2 to a final concentration of 0.003%. Use always freshly prepared solution.\nPreparation of the recording setup (Figure 2)\n\t\nConnect the amplifier to a PC interface for digitizing data.\nUse a PC-based program or an analogue timer to trigger a square pulse stimulator and data acquisition on PC hard drive.\nUse chlorided silverwires connected to standard glass electrode holders as for stimulation and recording.\nAssemble three manipulators for stimulation, recording and reference electrode respectively around a stereotactic frame for mice, so that all electrodes have access to the prepared spinal cord later on.\nConnect tubings and syringes to the electrode holders to be apple to apply negative pressure.\n2. General Comments for Animal Experiments and Animal Preparation for Recording Procedure",
    "Perform all experiments using mice according to the guidelines of the respective institutional animal care and use committee. Perform all surgery and recordings under deep anesthesia ensuring that animal suffering is minimized.\nAnesthetize the animal by i.p. injection of ketamine/xylazine (125mg and 8mg per g BW of ketamine and xylazine, respectively; 10 µl/g BW of the prepared solution as described above). If necessary during long-term recordings, additional injections can be made i.p. or i.m.\n\tNote: Repetitive i.m. injections of 0.05-0.1 ml of ketamine/xylazine solution in the upper thighs have proven to be suitable to keep the animal in deep anesthesia for up to 3 hr.\nUse vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nFix the head of the animal in a stereotactic frame and use a heating pad with rectal probe and reflex loop to control body temperature of the animal during the experiment. Fixation of the spinal cord in a stereotaxic frame is not necessary.\nBefore starting the preparation, check depth of narcosis by eyeblink reflex and twitching between toes of the mice. Reflexes should be abolished.\nOpen the skin along the midline above the spinal cord from the upper thoracic level to lower lumbar areas to get a clear operational field using a scalpel. Do not use scissors to make skin incisions. Carefully loose the skin from the underlying tissue. During subsequent steps keep the wound moistened by 0.9% saline.\nCut tendons and connective tissue on both side of the vertebrae from lumbar to thoracic levels using scalpel and scissor.\nRemove the spinous processes and rest of connective tissue around the vertebrae using a small nipper.",
    "Carefully crack vertebrae with the nipper starting from lumbar levels (L4/L5) under a dissecting microscope. Shove the tip of the nipper in the space between the vertebrae and the spinal cord and lift bone pieces apart. Do not harm the dura and avoid pressure to the spinal cord. Both are critical for success. Keep the spinal cord moistened during the whole procedure. Proceed to mid-thoracic levels.\n3. Separating of Dorsal Roots and DRP Recording (Figure 2)\nOpen the dura mater carefully using a thin needle (30 G) with a bent tip. Use aCSF for moistening from now on.\nSeparate the dorsal roots as far as possible using the gauge and cut two adjacent roots as distal as possible. Vigorous pulling on the roots during separation affects the success of the experiment.\nLower the suction electrode down to the dorsal roots. Add as much aCSF to the spinal cord as possible because liquid helps to suck in the dorsal roots.\nSuck the cut end of one dorsal root into one glass pipettes by applying negative pressure through a syringe. If needed, move the dorsal root in front of the electrode opening using a fine needle.\nIf the dorsal root lies dry within the suction electrode, add some aCSF to its tip while carefully sucking until the pipette is sufficiently filled with aCSF.\nAfter the dorsal root is sucked in, raise the electrode tip from the spinal cord. Take care that no “water bridge” between the pipette tip and the spinal cord short-circuit the recording/stimulation electrode.\nRepeat steps 3.3-3.6 for an ipsilateral adjacent root.\nPosition the reference electrode as close as possible to the dorsal roots and keep it moistened by applying aCSF.",
    "By establishing the recording setup, one root is already chosen for stimulation, the other for recording. Increase voltage stepwise while recording from the second dorsal root is done in current clamp mode. One may notice a short downward deflection which is followed by a slow, long-lasting upward deflection representing the DRP.\nAdjust the stimulus voltage to supramaximal levels and record several sweeps (at least 20 - 30 sweeps/dorsal root at 0.1 Hz, filter between 0.3 Hz-3 kHz).\nRecord short trains of three stimuli (100 Hz) to get information about the time-dependent summation of the DRP.\nSwitch recording and stimulation site for additional contralateral recordings.\nAnimals are not intended to survive the procedure. Sacrifice animals after last recording by decapitation while still under deep anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine, see above, step 2.2).\n4. Data Analysis\nTransfer data to analysis program (e.g. Sigma Plot, Igor Pro, or MATLAB).\nCalculate average traces from 20-30 sweeps.\nTake the maximal amplitude of the voltage deflection (from baseline; DRP peak amplitude) for further analysis (Figure 3).\nCalculate the ratio of the DRP peak amplitude after three pulses and single pulse to gain a measure of the time dependent summation of subsequent potentials.\nSubscription Required.
