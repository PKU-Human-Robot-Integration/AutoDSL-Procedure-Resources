    "1. Cultivation of Arabidopsis plants\nSoak Arabidopsis thaliana seeds in sterilized deionized water in a microtube, and incubate for 2 days at 4 °C in the dark.\nPlace approximately four of the imbibed, cold-treated seeds onto the soil surface using a micropipette. Incubate the planted pots in a growth chamber with a 16 h light (120 μmol photons m–2 s–1) and 8 h dark period at 22 °C and 20 °C, respectively.\nGrow one plant per pot by thinning other seedlings after germination. Prepare at least five pots. Incubate the plants in the growth chamber for an additional 4 weeks. Three plants are used for the experiments.\nUse the youngest, fully-opened mature leaf for photosynthesis measurements.\n2. Setting up the sample stage, photosynthetic instruments, and light source\nNOTE: For this protocol, a custom-built sample stage was used for fixing leaves and detection probes (Figure 1).\nAttach a 10 cm2 steel plate with a 1 cm diameter hole onto the custom-made sample stage. The hole size in this plate can be changed to accommodate different leaf samples or plant species. The stage has a clip for fixing the detection probes and an adjuster to adjust the distance between the probes and the leaf sample.\nPrepare thin fiber probes for measuring chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf reflectance. These thin fiber probes will be positioned closely so that they measure signals from the same leaf position.\n\tNOTE: A PAM chlorophyll fluorometer and a spectral radiometer were adapted for signal detection of chlorophyll a fluorescence and leaf reflectance, respectively. Both instruments use thin fiber probes with diameters of 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively.\nFit these two probes tightly together and wrap them with plastic tape.",
    "Clip the taped probes onto the sample stage using a coaxial lens holder (see Figure 1), and position them vertical to the leaf surface.\n\tNOTE: The field of view of the fiber optic cable in the spectral radiometer is α = 25°. In this method, the distance between the fiber probe tips and leaf surface is shorter than 1 cm. Therefore, the measuring leaf area is almost the same as that of the fiber.\nAttach a biforked light guide made of glass fibers to the halogen light source and irradiate the sample stage from both directions at angles of approximately 45°.\n\tNOTE: A halogen lamp, which is close to the wavelength distribution of natural sunlight, is used as actinic light for inducing photosynthesis. The halogen light source was adapted with a built-in cold filter, which removes long wavelengths from near infrared, to prevent increases in leaf surface temperature (λ = 400 to 800 nm).\nAdjust the light source so that light uniformly illuminates the sample stage without casting shadows.\n3. Setting up simultaneous measurements of leaf reflectance and chlorophyll fluorescence\nNOTE: All steps are performed in the dark room to avoid the detection of light other than actinic light. A weak-green light (e.g., green-cellophaned light) should be turned off before the actual measurements.\nMeasuring the distance between the leaf sample and the probes on the sample stage.\n\t\nPlace a test leaf on the leaf holder of the sample stage in the dark. Press the leaf against a steel plate on the stage (black square in Figure 1).\nTurn on the PAM and irradiate the leaf sample with a measuring light. The values of the chlorophyll fluorescence intensities are confirmed using PAM controlling software (see Table of Materials).",
    "Move the adjuster so that the fluorescence intensity measures approximately 100. Measure the distance between the probe and the leaf. Fix the adjuster, and record the value of the distance on the adjuster.\nTurn off the measuring light. Remove the test leaf.\nMeasuring the irradiance intensities of the actinic light\n\tNOTE: To observe light-dependent photosynthetic behaviors, actinic light of varying intensity is used to irradiate the leaf sample.\n\t\nSet a light quantum meter at the position where the sample leaf would be placed.\nIrradiate light from the halogen light source and measure the intensity.\nDetermine which positions of the light source dial would generate intensities of 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 μmol photons m–2 s–1.\n\t\tNOTE: Arabidopsis plants are grown under 120 μmol photons m–2 s–1; therefore, the irradiance intensities of the actinic light are selected to provide a range of small and large intensities.\nMark each irradiance intensity on the dial.\nMeasure a reflection standard.\n\tNOTE: A reflection standard is required to calculate the leaf reflectance ratio at each irradiance intensity.\n\t\nPlace a white plate as a reflectance standard at the position of the leaf sample.\nTurn on a spectral radiometer. The reflectance signal is shown by the spectral radiometer controlling software. At this time, there are no spectral data because there is no irradiating light.\nTurn on the halogen lamp to irradiate with 480 μmol photons m–2 s–1, the highest irradiance intensity in this test.\nAdjust the detection strength of the radiometer to avoid saturation.\nRecord spectral reflectance between 450–850 nm at 1 nm intervals under illumination with 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 μmol photons m–2 s–1.\n\t\tNOTE: A baseline electrical signal (dark current) is corrected and subtracted at every spectral measurement.",
    "4. Simultaneous measurements of leaf reflectance and chlorophyll a fluorescence, and calculation of photosynthetic parameters\nSet a plant at the leaf sample position.\n\t\nTransfer the Arabidopsis plant from the grown chamber to the controlled dark room with the same temperature and humidity as that of the growth chamber.\nIncubate the plant for 1 h in the dark at 22 °C to dissipate electrons from the PSII reaction center and to relax of non-photochemical quenching.\nPlace the dark-adapted whole plant on a lab jack under the sample stage (Figure 1).\nFix the sample leaf to the leaf holder so that the leaf surface is perpendicular to the detection probes.\nMeasurement of the maximum quantum yield of PSII.\n\t\nTurn on the PAM and start recording the curve. This value is called 0.\nTurn on the measuring light, and wait approximately 30 s for the curve to respond. This value is called F0.\nGive a saturated pulse of 4000 μmol photons m–2 s–1 for 0.8 s from the PAM.\nObtain the highest value of the spike in the curve with increased fluorescence intensity. This value is called FM.\nCalculate the maximum quantum yield of PSII in the dark (FV/FM), using the following equation.\nFV/FM = (FM – F0) / FM\nMeasurement of photosynthetic behaviors at steady state.\n\t\nTurn on the halogen lamp as the external light source with the measuring light on after recording FM (see 4.2.4). First, irradiate the leaf sample with the weakest light (30 μmol photons m–2 s–1).\nTurn on the spectral radiometer at the same time to monitor the leaf reflectance.\nWait for 20 min or longer for the photosynthetic reaction to reach steady state under the light conditions. The fluorescence intensity of the steady state is called Fs.",
    "Supply a saturating pulse at intervals of 1 min during illumination with the actinic light. The maximum fluorescence value achieved under the pulsed light is called FM′.\nRecord the data of FM′ at 20 min after turning on the actinic light.\nTake leaf reflectance data by averaging 10 scans at an optimized integration time, with a dark current subtraction.\nCalculation of photosynthetic parameters at steady state.\n\t\nCalculate the quantum yields of PSII photochemistry (ΦPSII), which can be estimated by irradiating with saturated pulses under actinic light, using the following equation.\n\t\tΦPSII = (FM′- FS) / FM′\nEstimate the linear electron flux (LEF) from the PSII reaction center as follows 4.\n\t\tLEF = The irradiance intensity of the actinic light × ΦPSII × 0.5 × 0.84\nCalculate the NPQ, which can be expressed the thermal dissipation, using the following equation.\n\t\tNPQ = (FM - FM′) / FM′\n\t\tNOTE: Light energy is primarily consumed by photosynthesis reactions. However, when plants absorb more light energy than energy consumed by photosynthesis, the mechanisms for the thermal dissipation are induced to avoid the excess energy.\nUsing the spectral data acquired with the radiometer under the same light conditions, calculate the leaf reflectance ratio as follows.\n\t\tReflectance ratio = Rleaf / Rstandard\nCalculate PRI from 531 nm and 570 nm as follows. These two wavelengths are extracted from the reflectance ratio.\n\t\tPRI = (R531–R570) / (R531+R570)\n\t\tNOTE: R is a reflectance.\nMeasuring of the relaxation kinetics of non-photochemical quenching.\n\t\nTurn off the actinic light after acquiring Fs and leaf reflectance.\nMonitor chlorophyll fluorescence by PAM for 10 min after turning off light.",
    "Provide a saturating pulse at intervals of 1 min during the dark relaxation. The maximum fluorescence value induced by the saturation pulse under the dark is called FM′′. Obtain ten of FM′′ in one test.\nSave the data of FM′′ at 2 min and 10 min after turning off the actinic light.\nTurn the actinic light on set to the next irradiance intensity, 60 μ mol photons m–2 s–1.\nRepeat a light adaptation for 20 min and a dark relaxation for 10 min with pulsing saturation light at intervals of 1 min. Record all data as described above. Repeat all steps and measurements using irradiation at 120, 240, and 480 μ mol photons m–2 s–1.\nCalculation of parameters of the non-photochemical quenching from the relaxation kinetics.\n\tNOTE: Light-dependent induction of NPQ is relaxed by turning off the light source13. It is possible to fractionate each NPQ function by adjusting the relaxation timescales.\n\t\nEstimate the qE (energy-dependent quenching) fraction using FM′′ after 2-min dark adaptation.\n\t\tqE = (FM2m′′–FM′) / FM′\n\t\tNOTE: The qE fraction is rapidly reversed within 1–2 min. This fraction includes mainly PsbS protonation and part of xanthophyll conversion, which depend on light-induced ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane13. Both are reversible on breakdown of the gradient.\nCalculate the qZ (zeaxanthin dependent quenching) fraction using FM′′ after 10-min dark adaptation.\n\t\tqZ = (FM10m′′–FM′) / FM′\n\t\tNOTE: A relaxation kinetics of NPQ at approximately 10 min after actinic light off reflects a xanthophyll cycle14. Most of the xanthophyll conversion is reversed at longer timescales of approximately 10 min (qZ) because the conversion requires a VDE (violaxanthin de-epoxidase) enzymatic reaction. The fraction is also relaxed by breakdown of the ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane.\nCalculate the qI (photoinhibitory state) as follows.\n\t\tqI = (FM–FM10m′′) / FM′",
    "NOTE: The slowest recovery among NPQ fractions is thought to be photodamage of PSII (indicating D1 turnover). This fraction of the photoinhibitory state (qI), which does not recover by 10 min15.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
