    "1. Initiation of Queries from Gene, Drug or Disease Terms\nAccess the homepage for \"RE:fine Drugs\" at the following link: http://drug-repurposing.nationwidechildrens.org. Begin by entering a query term in the search bar from any of the following three categories: drug (generic drug name), disease (new disease indication) or gene (official HGNC gene symbol).\nFilter the search bar function to include only \"Drug Name\", \"New Disease Indication\", \"Gene Symbol\" or \"All\" categories. The search bar includes an auto-fill function for query entries.\nPut in a keyword, and click on the \"Search\" button. Sort the table of results by any of the following columns: \"Drug\", \"Registered Indication\", \"P-Value\", \"P-Value Adjusted\", \"Odds Ratio\", \"Study\", \"New Indication\", \"Drug Bank Indication\", \"# of Medline Abstracts\", \"# of Clinical Trial Registry\", \"Potential\", \"SNP\", \"Gene\" or \"action\".\nNavigate to the advanced search option in order to enable the drug information feature. Click on the icon in the \"Info\" column for a particular drug. Observe a page that lists the all the corresponding information including p-Value for the association, Disease name, Drug name, Gene details (NCBI Gene link) and Drug details (DrugBank link).\n2. Exploration of Advanced Options\nClick on the \"advanced\" button located on the right side of the page, and several options to further refine the results are provided. The advanced search options include modifications to the following: drug, association, disease, potential, gene and action.\nExport results tables by clicking on the \"Export\" button on the right side of the page. Click on the \"Simple\" button in order to fold down the advanced search window.\nUnder the advanced option \"drug\" tab, specify a particular drug indication or an additional drug name to filter results.",
    "Under the \"association\" tab, filter results by the significance level P-Value, Adjusted P-Value with FDR, effect size (Odds Ratio), and/or Study type (GWAS, PheWAS or Both).\nUnder the \"disease\" tab, specify a certain disease description for the predicted new use.\nUnder the \"potential\" tab, filter results according to any of the following criteria: (i) whether the drug indication is contained in the DrugBank database, (ii) number of Medline abstracts with co-occurrence of the drug and the disease, (iii) number of ClinicalTrials.gov database entries with co-occurrence of the drug and the disease and (iv) Repurposing Potential.\n\tNOTE: The Repurposing Potential option describes the novelty of the discovery: (i) Known: relationship already exists in the DrugBank database, (ii) Strongly supported: some support in both clinical trial registry and the Medline abstracts, (iii) Likely: some support in either clinical trial registry or the Medline abstracts and (iv) Novel: no evidence in clinical trial registry nor in Medline abstracts.\nUnder the \"gene\" tab, enter a SNP identifier or Gene Symbol to filter results by specific drug target genes.\nUnder the \"action\" tab, specify the drug action type against the drug target(s), including agonist, antagonist, other, unknown or all (source: DrugBank database)."
