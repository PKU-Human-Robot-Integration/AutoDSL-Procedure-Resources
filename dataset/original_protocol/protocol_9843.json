    "1. Preparation of buffers\nTo prepare the ELISA wash buffer, add 3.94 g Tris-base, 8.77 g NaCl, and 1 g bovine serum albumin (BSA) to 1 L of deionized (DI) water. Add 500 µL polysorbate-20. Adjust the pH to 7.2 using HCl or NaOH.\nTo prepare the blocking buffer, add 3.94 g Tris-base, 8.77 g NaCl, and 10 g BSA. Add 500 µL polysorbate-20 to 1 L of DI water. Adjust the pH to 7.2 using HCl or NaOH.\nTo prepare the elution buffer (PBS), add 8.01 g NaCl, 2.7 g KCl, 1.42 g Na2HPO4, and 0.24 g KH2PO4 to 1 L DI water. Adjust the pH to 7.4 using HCl or NaOH.\n\t​NOTE: A 10x solution of this buffer can be made and diluted with DI water as needed.\n2. Preparation of OMV sample\nGrow A. actinomycetemcomitans cells to the late exponential phase (optical density at 600 nm of 0.7). Pellet the cells by centrifuging twice at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min. Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 µm filter.\nConcentrate the bacteria-free supernatant using 50 kDa-molecular weight cut-off filters. Ultracentrifuge the concentrated solution at 105,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 min. \nResuspend the pellet in PBS and ultracentrifuge again (105,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 min.) Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of PBS.\n3. Packing the S-1000 column",
    "Mix the stock bottle of gel filtration medium with a glass stir rod and pour out into a glass bottle the volume necessary to fill the column, plus approximately 50% excess (about 135 mL). Let these beads sit until they have settled, and then decant off the excess liquid. Resuspend the beads in elution buffer, so that the final solution is approximately 70% (by volume) gel, 30% buffer. Degas the solution under vacuum.\nMount the glass column vertically using a ring stand and fill with elution buffer to wet the walls of the column. Drain the buffer until there is only about 1 cm of buffer remaining in the column.\nWithout creating bubbles, carefully pipette beads into the column, filling the column to the top. Continue to drain excess buffer throughout this process. Be sure to not let the beads settle completely before adding additional beads to the top of the column. The column should be packed to a height of about 2 cm below the bottom of the column reservoir.\n4. Loading the sample and collecting fractions\nDegas the elution buffer under vacuum. Wash the column with two column-volumes (180 mL) of elution buffer.\nAllow the remaining buffer to fully enter the column. Once the buffer has reached the top of the gel layer, carefully pipette a 2-mL sample containing OMVs (at a lipid concentration of approximately 100 - 200 nmol/L) onto the surface of the beads, being careful not to disturb any of the beads at the top of the column. Allow the sample to fully enter the gel, that is, when no liquid remains above the gel layer. \nCarefully and slowly add elution buffer on top of the gel column. Do not disturb the top layer of the gel, as this will cause sample dilution.",
    "Place a single 50-mL tube under the column and open the column. Collect the first 20 mL of the eluent. Add additional elution buffer to the top of the column, carefully, as needed to ensure the column is never dry.\nPlace a series of 1.5 mL tubes under the column. Start the column and collect a series of 1-mL samples in each tube. As the samples are being collected, continue to add elution buffer to the top of the column, as necessary. Repeat until 96 fractions have been collected. Stop the column.\n\tNOTE: The samples should be stored at -20 °C for long-term storage or 4 °C for short-term storage until further analysis.\nTo clean the column, run one column volume (90 mL) of 0.1 M NaOH through the column. Run two column volumes (180 mL) of elution buffer through the column.\n5. Sample analysis\nTo measure the lipid concentration in each fraction, pipette 50 µL of each fraction into a single well of a 96-well plate. To each well, add 2.5 µL of lipophilic dye. Incubate for 15 s. Measure the fluorescence intensity on a plate reader with an excitation wavelength of 515 nm and an emission wavelength of 640 nm. To calculate the fraction of all lipid in each sample, sum all of the emission intensities and divide each individual intensity by the total.\nTo measure the concentration of a particular protein, pipette 100 µL of each fraction into a single well of an ELISA immuno-plate. Incubate at 25 °C for 3 h.\n\t\nDecant the samples. Add 200 µL of ELISA wash buffer to each well and decant. Repeat four times for a total of five washes.\nAdd 200 µL of blocking buffer to each well and incubate for 1 h at 25 °C. Decant.",
    "Incubate plates with 100 µL blocking buffer plus primary antibody (1:10,000 for purified antibody; 1:10 for unpurified antibody) overnight at 4 °C. Decant.\nAdd 200 µL of ELISA wash buffer to each well and decant. Repeat four times for a total of five washes.\nAdd 100 µL of ELISA wash buffer plus secondary antibody (1:30,000) to each well. Incubate for 1 h at 25 °C.\nAdd 200 µL of ELISA wash buffer to each well and decant. Repeat four times for a total of five washes.\nAdd 100 µL of the 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) one-step solution and incubate for 15-30 min or until a blue color develops. Stop the TMB reaction with 50 µL of the stopping solution.\nOn a plate reader, read the absorbance of each well at a wavelength of 450 nm.\nTo measure the total protein concentration, record the absorbance at a wavelength of 280 nm (A280) of each fraction, using a UV-vis spectrophotometer.\nA schematic of the protocol is shown in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62429/62429fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic of SEC procedure. The column is packed with degassed gel filtration medium carefully to avoid bubbles and discontinuities, then washed with two column volumes of elution buffer. Next, the sample is carefully pipetted onto the top of the gel, without disrupting gel packing. The column is opened and run until the sample completely enters the gel. At this point, buffer is placed on the top of the column, and the first 20 mL of eluate is collected. Next, a series of 1-mL fractions is collected. These fractions are then placed in a 96-well plate or 96-well immuno-plate for analysis of lipid and protein content.
