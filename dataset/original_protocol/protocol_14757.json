    "1. Clonogenic Assay\nPrepare a single cell suspensions of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D cells using the steps outlined below\n\t\nAspirate the culture medium (DMEM/10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum/glutamine and pen/strep) from a 10 cm tissue culture dish which is no more than 50% confluent with MCF-7 or T-47D cells. Rinse with PBS. Incubate with trypsin 0.25%/2.21 mM EDTA dissolved in DMEM high glucose at 37 °C for 1-4 min.\nCheck cells at 1 min intervals under a phase contrast microscope to ensure a single cell distribution. Resuspend the cells with a 2 ml pipette by pipetting up and down several times to disrupt cell-cell contact to achieve an almost invariable, single cell status.\nContinue to incubate cells in trypsin at 37 °C for up to 4 min if you observe clumps of cells after only 2 min of incubation. Do not use these cells for clonogenic studies if they remain adherent to each other after 4 min of trypsinization because error will be introduced in the colony number yield.\n\t\tNOTE: If cells are clumped, the number of colonies formed will reflect the product of fewer cells than the number incubated. If cells are excessively trypsinized, their clonogenic potential may be diminished.\nPrepare a single cell suspension of 1,500 cells/ml culture medium for 24 well plates, or less, (+ 500 cells/ml, depending on the cell type or passage number), by serial dilutions in one master tube containing the entire volume needed for all of the variables in the experiment.",
    "NOTE: The goal is a final cell density of 800 cells/cm2 (range of approximately 500 to 1,100 cells/cm2). The goal is to yield approximately 100 + 50 colonies, which permits relatively easy counting, prevents crowding and permits sufficient colonies to result in significant statistical differences when colonies are increased or decreased by experimental perturbations.\nIncubate Cells at Clonogenic Density Using Steps Outlined Below\n\t\nIncubate cells in quadruplicate wells on 24 well fibronectin-coated plates at a clonogenic density of 1,500 cells/well from a master single cell suspension tube of 1,500 cells/ml. Triturate the medium containing cells with a 5 ml pipette by drawing up 3 ml and dispensing 1 ml medium in each of 2 wells.\n\t\tNOTE: Fibronectin-coated plates should be purchased pre-coated from a commercial vendor. Coating plates outside of a quality controlled, automated process results in an uneven surface unsuited for this assay.\nMix the suspension by pipetting up and down with a 5 ml pipette, draw up 3 ml of cell suspension and fill 2 wells with 1 ml each. Fill only 2 wells at any one time from one pipette. Return the remaining volume in the pipette to the cell suspension in the master tube, resuspend cells again by pipetting up and down and draw up another 3 ml to fill another 2 wells with 1 ml each.\n\t\tNOTE: Continuous mixing of the master tube is necessary because cells will continuously sediment. Drawing up sufficient volume to fill only 2 wells is necessary to add similar cell numbers to each well because cells sediment in the pipette as well.\nWork rapidly to distribute the large volumes of cells because allowing cells to sit in suspension at room temperature and CO2 concentration will modulate their clonogenic potential (unpublished observations).",
    "Optimize the spatial distribution of cells during the act of pipetting them into wells for colony assays. Do so by slowly pipetting the suspension containing the final cell concentration into the middle of the well. Do not subject the plate to further motion before cells settle to the bottom. Do not swirl the plate because circular mixing will effectively centrifuge the cells to the perimeter of the well creating high cell densities and uncountable confluent colonies at 6 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not mix unless necessary since this is less desirable than no mixing at all after introducing the volume with the cells in suspension. If it is necessary to mix cells, do so by moving the plate back and forth in perpendicular directions while it rests on a flat surface.\nIncubate cells at 37 °C 5% CO2 without media change for 6 days. The small number of cells in a well after 6 days will not significantly impact the nutrient or cytokine composition nor the pH of the original medium.\nDesign the time course of the assay as follows: Incubate cells on fibronectin coated substrata on day  1. Replace existing medium with 1 ml fresh medium or fresh medium containing FGF-2 10 ng/ml on day 0. Stain cells on day 6 as below in 1.4). Conduct any experimental perturbations on day 3, as below in 1.3). \nSet Up Experimental Perturbations of Molecular Signaling or Adhesion Molecules\n\t\nOn day 3, add 100 μl of a solution containing 10x of the final intended concentration of the perturbing agent to the 1 ml medium in the wells. Do not mix. Continue to incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for an additional 3 days.",
    "NOTE: Perturbing agents can include a variety of inhibitors and blocking agents of adhesion molecules, receptors or other surface proteins, inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways, molecules, factors, cofactors or structural proteins, that may play roles in supporting the dormant state.\nStain colonies on day 6, as follows. \nStain Colonies\n\t\nStain cells after 6 days in culture with a freshly made 0.1% crystal violet in 2% ethanol/10 mM sodium borate (pH 9.0) solution. Aspirate media and add one ml crystal violet solution to each well for 20 min.\nWash plates by immersing them with the well openings facing down at an acute angle into an ice bucket overflowing with continuously running tap water in the sink. Tilt the plate to a horizontal angle once underwater, well opening down, and then tilt back to an acute angle when removing in one gentle flowing motion.\nRepeat the immersion 2 or 3 times until the water at the bottom of the wells is no longer blue. Vigorous washes may remove cells or colonies that are less adherent due to experimental intervention, adding significantly to the error in counting and the data.\nDry plates overnight by placing them upside down on towels on the bench top adjacent to their corresponding labeled covers. \nCount Colonies\n\t\nCount the number of growing and dormant colonies in each well after 6 days of incubation, staining and drying. Count colonies optimally at 40X magnification in an inverted phase contrast microscope. Count colonies of >30 cells as growing and colonies of 12 or less cells, with the morphological appearance of very large size compared to growing cells, large expanded cytoplasm with large cytoplasm to nucleus ratios, shown in Figure 17,15.",
    "NOTE: Clusters of 13-29 cells are not normally counted as they are not very frequent in straightforward dormancy assays. They can be counted if perturbations shift the growth potential of either growing or dormant cells. These results will then need to be correlated with biological significance.\n2. Clonogenic Incubation for Immunofluorescence Studies\nAdjust cell numbers to approximately 7,500-8,000 cells/well in 6 well plates, to correspond to cell numbers/surface area analogous to 24 well experiments.\nPlace a round, sterile, fibronectin-coated cover slip into each well base of 6 well plates for imaging studies prior to cell addition. Pipet cells in 3 ml volumes into each well 2 wells at a time at concentrations outlined, as described for the clonogenic experiments above in 1.2).\nIncubate cells for 6 days, as above in 1.2.4 and 1.2.5. Add perturbing factors on day 3 at 10x concentrations in 300 μl volumes, as described in the colony assay procedures in 1.3).\nStain cells on day 6 with antibodies to cell adhesion molecules such as integrins α4, α5, α6, β1, β3, for example, focal adhesion complex molecules FAK, paxillin and vinculin, for example, proteins involved in motility such as α-tubulin, for example, signaling pathway members such as phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, for example, or any other protein that is the target of investigation for its role in dormancy, using standard techniques for direct or indirect immunofluorescence staining.\n\t\nRemove slides with forceps day 6. Fix in acetone/methanol 1:1 at -20 °C for 20 min and air dry. An alternative fixative, such as paraformaldehyde, may be used, if necessary. Permeabilize cells with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min for detection of intracellular antigens. Wash cells with PBS.",
    "For indirect immunofluorecence staining, block slides for 1 hr at room temperature with 5% BSA or with 10% preimmune serum from the species in which the secondary antibody was generated.\nIncubate overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies to cell adhesion molecules, focal complex molecules, signaling pathway members or any other protein that is the target of investigation for its role in dormancy diluted to specific dilutions recommended by the manufacturer in PBS 0.1% TRITON X-100.\nWash 3 times with PBS. Incubate cover slips with fluorophor-conjugated antibodies at room temperature for 2 hr. As an example, Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey anti-Mouse IgG Antibody can be used to detect murine monoclonal primary antibodies. Mount coverslips cell side down on glass slides using an antifade agent with Dapi. Seal the perimeters with nail polish.\nFor direct immunofluorescence, carry out the BSA blocking as above in 2.4.2), incubate with fluorophor-conjugated primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Wash 3 times with PBS. Incubate the slides with an antifade agent and Dapi and seal with nail polish.\nCover slide trays with aluminum foil and store at 4 °C for imaging and photography anytime up to several weeks later. View and photograph cells using any fluorescence microscopic imaging systems equipped with a camera at 1,000x magnification.\nFor fibrillar actin staining, block slides in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min and incubate in BODIPY FL-Phallacidin (green) or Rhodamine phalloidin (red) at room temperature for 20 min. Add an antifade agent and seal as above.\n3. Clonogenic Incubation for Molecular Studies\nWestern Blots\n\t\nIncubate ER+ breast cancer cells MCF-7 or T47D at clonogenic densities of 20,000 cells/60 mm plate and 50,000 cells/100 mm plate on fibronectin-coated plates at 37 °C in 5% CO2.",
    "Incubate cells at slightly higher densities of 75,000 cells/100 mm plate for molecular studies requiring mg amounts for protein from lysates. Use up to ten plates per experimental point to collect sufficient protein for molecular studies using Western blots or for RNA isolation for Northern blots.\nCell number based gel loading is a necessary adjunct for comparing protein expression in vastly different-sized growing and dormant cells. Collect cells by trypsinizing and count an aliquot in a hemocytometer in 0.2% Trypan Blue for preparation of lysates for Western blots instead of scraping off the cells with a single edge blade.\nCentrifuge cells at 10,000 x g for 2 min, remove media by aspiration, add 200 μl lysis buffer, sonicate the cells in lysis buffer and determine the protein concentration.\nCalculate the amount of protein per cell by dividing the protein yield by the number of cells that generated that amount. Load the lysate into each well of separate polyacrylamide gels that represents both a) equivalent amounts of protein and b) protein quantities representing equivalent cell numbers. At least 25 μg protein should be loaded into each well.\n\t\tNOTE: This will permit comparisons between growing and dormant cells, which are significantly different in size and protein content (Figure 1).\nFlow Cytometry\n\t\nCollect cells from 100 mm plates by trypsinization, as in 3.1 and analyze by standard fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) protocols using primary or secondary immunofluorescence staining for either intracellular or extracellular antigens, as outlined in 2.4.\n\t\tNOTE: Detaching cells from tissue culture plates by trypsinization does not affect the concentration of membrane proteins as determined by antibody labeling.\nSubscription Required.
