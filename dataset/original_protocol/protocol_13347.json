    "The animal experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal Research and Ethics of the Hebei Yiling Medical Research Institute (approval number: N2020150). The 36 Sprague-Dawley (SD) female rats (3 months old, weighing 180-200 g) (see Table of Materials) were fed with normal food and clean water in the new drug evaluation center of Hebei Yiling Medical Research Institute and were exposed to artificial light for 12 h per day in rooms with controlled temperatures (20-26 °C) and relative humidity (40%-70%).\n1. Animal experiment\nDivide the rats into six groups randomly, a sham-operated group (SHAM group, 10 mL/kg/d saline), model group (OVX group, 10 mL/kg/d saline), progynova15 group (0.2 mg/kg/d), low-dose BZBS group (BZBSL group, 1 g/kg/d), middle-dose BZBS group (BZBSM group, 2 g/kg/d), and high-dose BZBS group (BZBSH group, 4 g/kg/d).\n\tNOTE: The dose of the BZBSM group was determined from the recommended dosages for humans and calculated as follows: equivalent experimental dose for rats (mg/kg/d) = human dose (mg/kg)/body weight (60 kg) x 6.3.\nEmploy 3% and 1.5% isoflurane for the induction and maintenance of rat anesthesia throughout the operation, respectively.\n\tNOTE: If the rats do not blink and the pedal reflex is absent, the depth of anesthesia is confirmed and the maintenance of rat anesthesia is conducted, respectively.\nApply local analgesia with a topical injection of 1.5 mg/kg bupivacaine after anesthesia. Remove the fur of the rat's abdomen with a razor and disinfect the skin of the rat's abdomen using ethanol and povidone-iodine 3x with a sterile cotton ball.\nPerform a 2 cm midline incision on the abdomen of the rat with a scalpel in the SHAM group and suture the midline incision using a 4-0 surgical suture.",
    "For the rats in the other groups, isolate and expose the intact ovary using forceps and ligate at the root of the ovary using a 4-0 surgical suture. Remove the intact ovary using surgical scissors. Suture the midline incision using a 4-0 surgical suture.\n\tNOTE: All postoperative rats were placed in isolation in 37 °C containers until the rats were awake and able to move freely.\nAfter 4 months of intragastric administration of designated drugs (in step 1.1), first anesthetize the rat with 3% isoflurane, and then disinfect the skin of the groin and entire lower limb using ethanol and povidone-iodine 3x with a sterile cotton ball.\n\tNOTE: The drug was administered once a day with a 10 cm stainless steel gavage needle. The gavage dose was adjusted weekly according to the weight of the rats.\nCut and peel the skin of the groin to expose the femoral artery using surgical scissors and tweezers. Collect a blood sample from the femoral artery using a vacuum blood collection tube and then apply pressure to stop bleeding with a cotton ball.\nContinue to cut and peel the skin of the groin and the lower limb to expose the intact tibia using surgical scissors and tweezers. After removing the tibia, wash it three times with saline and continue to remove excess muscle tissue in saline with tweezers and ophthalmic scissors.\nDisinfect the back skin of the lumbar L4 using ethanol and povidone-iodine 3x with a sterile cotton ball. Use surgical scissors and tweezers to cut the back skin and expose the lumbar L4.",
    "Sever the upper and lower vertebrae of the lumbar L4 with a rongeur and cut off the sternum around the lumbar L4 with surgical scissors. Wash the isolated lumbar L4 with saline three times and continue to remove excess muscle tissue in saline with tweezers and micro scissors.\nStore the tibia and L4 vertebra in 10% formalin tissue fluid (see Table of Materials) at room temperature for 3 days.\nEuthanize the rats with excessive inhalation of carbon dioxide, pack the carcass in a special cadaver bag, and place it in an animal carcass storage cabinet.\n2. Micro-CT imaging16\nPress the green power button to turn on the micro-CT scanner (see Table of Materials) and start the software to heat the x-ray source.\n\tNOTE: To avoid scattering of the x-rays, move any metal objects near the imaging area before starting. Micro-CT examination of rat tibial tissue in step 1.11 with insufficient x-ray irradiation can affect the findings. The bone should be kept moist during the micro-CT scanning. The animal bed should be taken out while warming up. Make sure that the key is turned to the ON position on the SAFETY KEY in the lower left corner in front of the CT instrument.\nCreate a database by clicking on a new one to build a file to save the data to obtain next.\nSet the data acquisition parameters in the software control window as follows: x-ray tube voltage (50 kV); CT x-ray tube current (100 µA); live x-ray tube current (100 µA); field of view (FOV) (18 mm); no gating technique; scanning technique (high resolution 4 min).",
    "Wash the tibia with saline three times and blot out excess water with filter paper. Wrap the tibia tissue on the bed with plastic film to fix its position. Adjust the tibia tissue to the center of the imaging field by rotating the button in the instrument.\nClose the instrument door and turn on the live mode. Press the capture button to view the tibial tissue.\nStart the scan by clicking the CT scan button. Click Yes to produce the image.\n\tNOTE: Once the x-ray is turned on, the orange light at the top of the instrument will be illuminated and the sliding door will not open for the safety of the operator. When the scan is complete, a new window appears in the 2D Viewer software showing the reconstructed cross-axis, coronal plane, and sagittal plane. Click Paste to the drawing board to save.\nTake the tibia out of the animal bed. Open the Analyze 12.0 software and import the objective CT image by clicking File > Load > Process. Click the Image Calculator... and Region Pad options to display the SubRegion dialog box.\n\t\nClick the Interactive option and select the bone in the 2 mm thickness area.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining",
    "Take out the tibia and L4 vertebra samples of the rat in step 1.11 and store them in 20% formic acid solution for a 4 day decalcification.\n\tNOTE: The 20% formic acid solution is prepared by mixing 2,400 mL of formaldehyde solution and 600 mL of formic acid solution.\nPut the processed tibia and L4 vertebra sample of the rat from step 3.1 in the embedding box and wash them with running water for more than 6 h.\nDehydrate the samples with gradient concentration alcohol solutions (60% ethanol for 1 h, 70% ethanol for 1 h, 90% ethanol for 1 h, 95% ethanol for 2 h, and 100% ethanol for 2 h) using an automated tissue processor.\nPlace the tissue specimens in xylene for 2 h to make them translucent. At the end of dehydration, place the permeabilized samples in paraffin wax at 60 °C for 3 h and embed them in an automatic processor.\nObtain the 4 µm sections by using a rotary slicer. Place the sections in hematoxylin stain for 3-8 min and eosin stain for 1-3 min.\nTransfer the stained sections to pure alcohol and xylene, respectively. Seal and fix the stained sections with neutral gum for pathological examination under an optical microscope.\nScan the slices with a slide scanner (see Table of Materials) at 40x magnification and use the viewing software to acquire the H&E staining results of the entire tibia and L4 vertebra.\n4. Immunohistochemistry\nPerform heat-induced epitope retrieval using the 4 µm tibia sections obtained in step 3.5. Add the appropriate antigen repair buffer (citric acid buffer, pH = 6.0) to a microwaveable container. Place the carrier sheet into the microwaveable container and place the container in the microwave oven. Set the program to hold the antigen repair for 20 min at 98 °C.",
    "Remove the container and rinse the interior with cold tap water for 10 min. Block endogenous peroxidase activity with hydrogen peroxide (3% H2O2) (see Table of Materials), then incubate the slice for 15 min at room temperature.\nWash the sections in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (see Table of Materials) three times, 5 min each.\nPut the sections into normal goat serum blocking solution (see Table of Materials), then incubate the samples in a moist chamber for 15 min at room temperature.\nAdd 200 µL of RANKL antibody (1:200) (see Table of Materials), OPG antibody (1:300) (see Table of Materials), and sclerostin antibody17 (1:200) (see Table of Materials) into the slice samples and incubate for one night at 4 °C in the dark.\n\tNOTE: Sclerostin is a negative regulator of bone growth. It is a secreted glycoprotein with a C-terminal cysteine knot-like domain and has a sequence similarity to the DAN family of bone morphogenetic protein antagonists17. This protein is not a member of the RANKL pathway.\nAdd biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (see Table of Materials) into the sections and incubate at room temperature for 30 min. Rinse the sections with PBS and use diaminobenzidine (DAB) (see Table of Materials) to stain the sections for 3-5 min at room temperature.\nDye the sections with hematoxylin for 1-2 min. After dehydrating and drying the sections, seal them with neutral gum.\nScan the sections at 40x magnification using a slide scanner (see Table of Materials) and capture digital images using an automatic microscope imaging system (see Table of Materials).\nOpen Imagepro Plus software (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nClick File to import the analysis image.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol\nEnsure that the ELISA kit for detecting 17β-estradiol includes the anti-17β-estradiol IgG-coated microplate (12 x 8 wells), 15 mL of stop solution, 22 mL of 17β-estradiol-HRP conjugate, 15 mL of 3,3',5,5' tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution, 50 mL of 10x washing solution, cover foils, a strip holder, the 17β-estradiol control, and a different concentration gradient of 17β-estradiol standard (see Table of Materials).\nRemove the 17β-estradiol kit from the refrigerator and place all the reagents at room temperature (18-25 °C).\nReagent preparation: Dilute the 10x washing solution with deionized water to prepare a 1x washing solution. Mix 50 mL of 10x washing solution with 450 mL of deionized water to make 500 mL of 1x washing solution.\nRemove the serum sample from the refrigerator and thaw it at room temperature.\nRemove the excess microtiter strips from the plate frame, return them to the foil bag containing the desiccant pack, reseal them, and store at 4 °C.\nAdd 25 µL of control, standard, or sample to each of their respective wells. Then, add 200 µL of 17β-estradiol-HRP conjugate to each well.\nCover all the wells with foil and incubate the plate at 37 °C for 2 h.\nRemove the foil and liquid from each well and wash the well three times with 300 µL of 1x washing solution.\n\tNOTE: Avoid overflowing of the reaction wells. Also, the soak time between each wash cycle should be >5 s. At the end, carefully remove the remaining fluid by tapping tissue paper strips before the next step.\nAdd 100 µL of TMB substrate solution to each well and incubate in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Add 100 µL of stop solution to each well and gently shake the microtiter plate for 30 s. Measure the absorbance of the sample at 450 nm within 30 min.\nDraw the average absorbance of the standards against concentration. Plot the best-fit curve by the plotted points.\nObtain the corresponding concentration values expressed in pg/mL by interpolating the values of the samples on the standard curve.\n\t​NOTE: The other protocols for detecting serum Ca2+, phosphorus, SOST, TRACP-5b, and β-CTX are the same as the 17β-estradiol measurement, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n6. Statistical analysis\nData were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Multiple comparisons were performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
