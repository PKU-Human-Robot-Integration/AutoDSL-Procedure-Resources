    "Rehydration of wheat grains (Philippe et al., 2006).   The germ part (see Figure 4) is removed with a razor blade, perpendicular to the crease zone (longitudinal axis) of the grain, and is discarded.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204004912_2011.jpg Figure 4. Wheat grain and position of razor blade during wheat germ removal. Both sides of grain are presented to easily localize the germ, brush and crease regions.    The grain is then placed in a Petri dish on top of Whatman filter paper moistened with dH2O, and left at +4 °C for 24 h.  Note: Whole rehydration procedure is skipped for young grains, which are naturally hydrated.     Preparing 70 µm-thin cross sections of wheat grains.    This step is done by using a Vibratome instrument according to instruction provided in the Instruction manual (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 2009). The grain is fixed with some glue onto the magnetic plate of the Vibratome. Orientation of the grain should be such that the longitudinal axis of the grain is placed perpendicular to the magnetic plate. Settings of the Vibratome instrument are as follows: frequency: 60; amplitude: 1.2; speed: 12.   A series of 400 µm-thick slices are cut and discarded, until the surface of the grain becomes flat and parallel to the razor blade of the Vibratome instrument.    Thin sections (approximately 70 µm) are then cut consecutively and placed immediately into Eppendorf tubes filled with 70% ethanol. They are stored at 4 °C until further processing.     Removing starch.    The wheat cross section is grabbed using a paint brush and transferred into a clean Eppendorf tube, filled with 0.5 ml of 1 mg/ml α-Amylase solution. This is allowed to incubate at 40 °C for 24 h on a Thermo-shaker.    Rinse thoroughly by transferring the wheat cross section into a clean Eppendorf tube filled with 1 ml of dH2O. Repeat this step twice.",
    "Wash the brush in water after each sample transfer. Note: This step is intended to avoid any hydrolysis of starch by endogenous enzyme activity, which would produce some glucans of similar masses as those expected from the hydrolysis of cell walls BG (additionally, when MALDI mass spectrometry is used for further analysis of the tissue, starch generates a strong suppressive effect on the signal).     Placing the cross-section onto an ITO glass plate (see Note 5).   Prepare the ITO glass plate that will receive the cross section:    Place a small piece of adhesive carbon tape at the location where the cross section will be deposited on the ITO glass plate;    With a Pasteur pipette, put a droplet of water on the tape.     Then, with a paint brush, grab the cross section from the Eppendorf tube. Lean the cross section at the surface of the water droplet, allowing it to detach from the paint brush. Proceed very gently, so to avoid any disruption or any distortion of the cross section (Figure 5).   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204004948_2527.jpg Figure 5. Positioning of grain section during wheat section grabbing a) and deposition onto the ITO plate (b, c).   Gently remove excess water with a Kimwipes tissue. Allow sample to dry at RT (approximately 30 min) (see Figure 6).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204005013_4312.jpg Figure 6. Appearance of the ITO plate with mounted wheat sections on it     Mount the ITO glass plate onto the MTP Slide Adapter II (Bruker) according to the manufacturer instructions [available in Bruker, (2012)].      Application of the hydrolytic enzyme on the cross section.    This step uses a homemade robot (see Figure 1 and Note 2).",
    "The aim is to deliver a controlled volume of enzyme onto the tissue by using an airbrush device, so that fine droplets of enzyme are applied on the tissue, thereby limiting the diffusion of the oligosaccharides released upon digestion over the tissue.   Spraying of the enzyme is achieved by connecting the electrospray probe mounted on the robotic arm  to a syringe pump delivering the enzymatic solution at a constant flow rate of 600 μl/h.    Spraying is assisted pneumatically with nitrogen (1.5 x 105 Pa).    The distance between the needle tip of the Electrospray probe and the ITO plate is 3 cm (Z-axis).    A X, Y deposition pattern following a “brush rectangle” is used (Figure 7).    The movement speed of the robot head was set at 5 mm/s.    Other parameters (X and Y axis start and end coordinates, volume of the enzyme placed into the syringe, number of spraying cycles) are set to ensure that the robot consistently deposits 0.3 μl of enzyme (4.6 U/ml endo-1,4-β-xylanase or 2 U/ml lichenase) per mm2 of sprayed area (corresponding to 0.0014 U xylanase and 0.0006 U lichenase per mm2 tissue).  Enzymes can be applied individually, consecutively or in mixture. Note: Endo-1,4-β-xylanase is used for AX hydrolysis, while lichenase is used for mixed-linkage BG hydrolysis.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141204/20141204005035_9888.jpg Figure 7. “Brush rectangle” pattern used for enzyme deposition. X and Y “start” and “end” positions are determined from the coordinates of the surface which must be covered by the enzyme.        Incubation.    The wheat cross sections covered by the enzyme in the previous step are allowed to incubate at 40 °C for 4 h.",
    "To prevent liquid from evaporating too fast and the enzyme becomes inactive, a wet atmosphere is maintained by placing the ITO plate into a sealed incubation chamber filled with 150 ml saturated K2SO4 and pre-incubated at 40 °C.    The ITO plate is placed on top of a 50 ml glass beaker weighted with stones and installed into the glass incubator (Figure 2).    After incubation, remove the tissues from the incubation chamber and let dry in the open air (approximately 15 min).     Additional step for MALDI MS measurement of the hydrolyzed cross sections: Deposition of the DMA-DHB MALDI matrix.    This step is performed with an automatic vibration vaporization system from Bruker (ImagePrep, see Figure 3) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Bruker Daltonik, 2007).    The settings are as follows (see Note 6): 1st Phase: 15 cycles: 12% spray power; 20% spray modulation; 2 sec spray time; 15 sec incubation time; 30 sec dry time. 2nd Phase: 40 cycles: 20% spray power; 25% spray modulation; 2 sec spray time; 30 sec incubation time; 60 sec dry time. During whole procedure N2 flow is provided at 2 x 105 Pa."
