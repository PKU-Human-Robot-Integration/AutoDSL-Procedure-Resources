    "Load 10 μL of this mixture into a hemacytometer.\nCount cells.\nCalculate number of cells per sample.\nCentrifuge the cells at 350 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nFlick the tubes to disrupt the cell pellets.\nResuspend cells to 2 × 106 cells/mL with PBMC media.\nTransfer 1 mL (2 × 106 cells) of cells to a fresh 10 mL tube and place on ice until you are ready to start the staining protocol.\nNote: The timing for this step is based on thawing four vials of PBMCs.\nWe routinely freeze aliquots of 107 PBMCs. The cells from each vial of 107 PBMCs was resuspended in 10 mL of PBMC media prior to counting. This may need to be adjusted to obtain an accurate cell count depending on the number of PBMCs you have per vial. If cells are resuspended in a smaller volume for counting, top the tube up to 10 mL with PBMC media after the cell count has been performed (step 3).\nAlternatives: An automated cell counter can be used instead of a hemocytometer. This may reduce the amount of time required for this step.\nCell staining\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes the procedure for staining PBMCs with metal-labeled antibodies. Cells are first stained with cisplatin, which is a viability stain used for dead cell discrimination, followed by a cocktail of metal-labeled antibodies against surface makers of interest. After surface staining, cells are fixed and permeabilized and then stained with metal-labeled antibodies against intracellular antigens. The cells are then fixed in the presence of an iridium-labeled DNA intercalator, which allows for the discrimination of nucleated cells from cellular debris. This protocol has been adapted from the Fluidigm MaxPar Nuclear Antigen Staining Protocol with Fresh Fix (https://fluidigm.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#700000009Daw/a/4u0000019gvy/k1.CbKFY8JN7swG2ZVHybPpEZldzMpDAZnJYQvxyrrc[href=https://fluidigm.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/]).",
    "Prepare Cell-ID Cisplatin, Fc receptor block and surface marker antibody cocktail.\nCell-ID Cisplatin: Dilute 5 mM Cell-ID Cisplatin 1:1,000 in DPBS to make a 5 μM working stock (prepare 200 μL/sample).\nFc receptor block: Dilute Human TruStain FcX 1:10 in cell staining buffer (prepare 50 μL/sample).\nSurface marker antibody cocktail: Dilute each surface marker antibody in cell staining buffer as indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] (prepare 50 μL/sample).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1525_3.csv\nPlace on ice until needed.\nCisplatin staining.\nAdd 2 mL of DPBS to each tube of cells containing 1 mL (2 × 106) of cells from step 8.\nCentrifuge the cells at 350 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nFlick the tubes to disrupt the cell pellets.\nAdd 200 μL of the Cell-ID cisplatin prepared in step 9a to each tube.\nPipette to mix and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: Cell-ID cisplatin staining must be performed in serum-free medium.\nCritical: Cells should be stained with Cell-ID cisplatin for a maximum of 5 min. Staining for longer than 5 min can result in significant cell death.\nAdd 2 mL of cell staining buffer to each tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 350 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nFlick the tubes to disrupt the cell pellets.\nSurface marker staining.\nAdd 50 μL of Fc receptor block prepared in step 9b to each tube.\nPipette to mix and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on an orbital mixer at 100 rpm.\nAdd 50 μL of antibody cocktail prepared in step 9c to each tube.\nPipette to mix and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C) on an orbital mixer at 100 rpm.\nAdd 2 mL of cell staining buffer to each tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 350 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.",
    "Flick the tubes to disrupt the cell pellets.\nRepeat steps 11e–11h.\nIntranuclear staining.\nVortex samples to thoroughly disrupt the cell pellets.\nAdd 1 mL of nuclear antigen staining buffer to each tube.\nVortex to mix and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd 2 mL of nuclear antigen staining perm to each tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 800 g for 5 min.\nNote: Cells are centrifuged at a higher speed after fixation to reduce cell loss.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nFlick the tubes to disrupt the cell pellets.\nRepeat steps 12d–12g.\nVortex samples to thoroughly disrupt the cell pellets.\nAdd 50 μL of a 1:50 dilution 161Dy-conjugated anti-T-bet (clone 4B10) antibody to each tube.\nPipette to mix and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAdd 2 mL of nuclear antigen staining perm to each tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 800 g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nFlick the tubes to disrupt the cell pellets.\nRepeat steps 12l–12o.\nVortex samples to thoroughly disrupt the cell pellets.\nPlace cells on ice for 10 min.\nIridium intercalator staining.\nWhile cells are incubating on ice, prepare the DNA intercalator.\nDilute 125 μM Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir 1:1,000 in Maxpar Fix and Perm Buffer to make a 125 nM working stock (prepare 1 mL/sample).\nAdd 1 mL of intercalator to each tube.\nVortex to mix and incubate at 4°C overnight (16–20 h).\nNote: Adequate fixation of cell suspensions is critical for maintaining cellular integrity during subsequent washes in ultra-pure water prior to acquisition. Failure to appropriately fix cell suspensions leads to loss of cells and clogging of the sample introduction system with debris during sample acquisition.",
    "Alternatives: Cell suspensions can also be fixed in a minimum of 4% fresh formaldehyde with iridium intercalator for at least 4 h, however overnight (16–20 h) fixation at 4°C is recommended.\nPause point: We usually run the samples on a Helios mass cytometer the next day, however samples may be stored for 2–4 days at 4°C without apparent detrimental effects.\nInstrument tuning\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step involves setting up the mass cytometer, followed by bead quality control (QC). Final sample preparation steps can be performed during instrument setup so that these can be acquired immediately on completing.\nTuning and QC is performed based on the standard Helios™ setup procedure as described in detail in the Helios User Guide. Note that other CyTOF™ systems such as the CyTOF2™ and CyTOF XT™ can also be used after following their specific setup procedures. Full tuning is recommended at the beginning of each day (described here), and with a full day analysis an additional quick tuning protocol is recommended to be run mid-way to ensure system responsiveness.\nConnect the nebulizer, and in the CyTOF software switch on the heater, nebulizer gas and sample flow running ultra-pure water. Droplet formation is monitored by spraying onto the underside of a cell culture dish lid.\nStop the sample instruction before mounting the nebulizer and when the heater temperature is >195°C, ignite the plasma. Leave instrument to thermally stabilize for a minimum of 20 min. A tube of tuning solution is introduced using the sample loader and the 159Tb dual count signal monitored in masses per reading mode until it has stabilized.\nIn tuning manager, launch the full automated tuning protocol. Signal from 159Tb should be >6 × 105 counts per pg.",
    "Remove tuning solution and wash for 3–5 min with wash solution, followed by 3–5 min with ultra-pure water.\nVigorously shake four element EQ bead bottle for 30 s and load a tube with 0.5 mL of beads into sample loader. Monitor bead rate using a rain plot with a protocol with bead channels open until event rate has stabilized. Collect 120 s of data.\nAfter EQ bead sample has finished acquisition, in the Process mode run clustering on the resulting EQ file to identify the main bead populations: 151Eu, 153Eu median signals should be >1,000 counts, and total bead numbers should be >6000.\nLoad a tube of ultra-pure water into the sample loader and run until samples are ready for acquisition.\nAt the end of the day, following sample acquisition (described below), run wash solution for 5 min and ultra-pure water for a further 5 min prior to shutting the system down, and removing the nebulizer. Refill the nebulizer with ultra-pure water to avoid clogging in dry state.\nSample acquisition\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section outlines the final sample preparation steps as well as acquisition of data from samples. Cell suspensions have previously been fixed and stained in a solution with iridium intercalator and have been stored at 4°C. They are retrieved and washed in batches throughout the course of the sample procedure to minimize degradation effects due to being resuspended in ultra-pure water.",
    "The timing for this step is based on acquiring four samples, with approximately 400,000 events acquired per sample. However, the time needed for acquisition of each sample depends on the cells available and the number of processed events needed for downstream analysis. A rule of thumb calculation is that approximately 0.75–1 × 106 cells can be introduced into the system per hour of instrument run time, and with a typical transport efficiency of approximately 55%–60%, this equates to around 0.4–0.6 × 106 events collected per hour. The number of “useable” events for downstream analysis then depends on any loss during pre-processing steps such as doublet discrimination and viability gating – see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]. Ultimately there is no hard and fast rule to the number of events to acquire per sample, and this should be informed by experimental design and analysis strategies (Marsh-Wakefield et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nWash cell suspensions.\nAn EQ bead suspension is made fresh daily by vigorously shaking the storage bottle for 30 s prior to aliquoting of 1 mL beads to 9 mL water. This step can be performed during the subsequent centrifugation steps.\nSamples that have been stained are retrieved from storage at 4°C. Each sample is in fixative and iridium intercalator in a volume of 1.0 mL.\nTransfer suspension to a round-bottomed 5 mL snap-cap centrifuge tube, add 4 mL ultra-pure water, replace tube cap and invert to mix.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 g for 8 min at ambient temperature in swinging bucket centrifuge, then decant supernatant.\nNote: The supernatant must be treated as toxic waste as it contains formaldehyde. Use appropriate PPE and follow institutional guidelines for waste disposal.\nGently flick cell pellet to resuspend, then add 4 mL of ultra-pure water, replace tube cap and invert to mix.",
    "Centrifuge at 1,000 g for 8 min at ambient temperature (20°C–25°C) in swinging bucket centrifuge, then decant supernatant, leaving cell in pellet form and stored on ice or at 4°C until acquisition.\nResuspend cells at approximately 0.75–1 × 106 cells per mL in a 1 in 10 dilution of EQ beads in ultra-pure water by pipetting, and filter through the mesh of a cell strainer tube.\nNote: Cell suspensions must be filtered immediately prior to acquisition to avoid clogging.\nAcquire sample on Helios.\nSet up a template that includes, at a minimum, all required parameters for the experiment. A full mass range template is recommended to monitor for unexpected metal contamination that could degrade instrument performance. The template can be set up during sample washing to save time.\nLoad sample and acquire in CyTOF software. Default sample collection settings are generally appropriate. Collection of .imd format files in addition to .fcs files is recommended as, in the unlikely event of poor event detection, data can be reprocessed to .fcs files.\nMonitor the run using a rain plot to ensure stable sample delivery, absence of clogging, and absence of metal contamination. With the High Throughput (HT) injector, an appropriate event rate is approximately 300–400 events per second, though lower event rates will reduce co-incidences and decrease eventual doublet events. If the event rate is higher than recommended, sample acquisition can be paused, and additional water/EQ mix can be added to adjust event rate.",
    "Following collection of data from each sample, load a tube of ultra-pure water on the sample introduction system and monitor the event rate in Preview mode until the event rate is < 1 per second. Note that processing of data into .fcs format may continue for some minutes after stopping data acquisition, and a tube of water can be run during this period to shorten washing time.\nBetween every 3–4 samples run wash solution for 3 min and then ultra-pure water for 3–5 min to remove lanthanides adhering to the sample tubing. Monitor the event rate in Preview mode until the event rate is < 1 per second.\nNote: In this example, a HT injector was used with cells suspended in a suspension of EQ beads in ultra-pure water. Use of a Wide Bore (WB) injector with cells resuspended in cell acquisition solution (not described here) is an alternative. Considerations for choice between use HT and WB injectors are instrument and sample dependent (Lee et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Thrash et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nEQ beads are included to normalize any signal drift during the run and is done post acquisition – see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]. Cell suspension samples are prepared throughout the day to avoid storage in pellet form for longer than necessary. A typical approach is to prepare two samples of approximately 106 cells per sample at one time, overlapping preparation times so that when one set is finished running, the first sample of the next set is ready to acquire."
