    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPlating hPSC for Differentiation\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes the passaging of hPSC cultures into monolayers appropriate for differentiation.\nCoat a 48-well plate with 5 μg/mL Laminin-521 and leave in the incubator for ≥2 h (see Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for laminin-521 dilution).\nNote: Differentiation can proceed in any size multi-well plate or flask. Adjust the Laminin-521 dilution, seeding density, and media volume accordingly.\nPassage hPSC at 70%–80% confluency by washing once in PBS−/−, adding 2 mL Accutase, and placing in the incubator for 4–6 min. Monitor the morphology of the cells closely during this period. Once colonies show a characteristic bright halo and are close to detaching, gently pipette using a P1000 until ≥90% of the flask has detached.\nRapidly dilute Accutase solution in ≥3 mL mTeSR and centrifuge at 260 × g for 3 min at 21°C.\nAspirate supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in fresh 21°C mTeSR supplemented with 10 μM Y27632 and count live cells using a hemocytometer.\nNote: Resuspend hPSC at 1–2 × 106 cells/mL to enable rapid, accurate counting. Typically, we resuspend hPSC in 1 mL/5–10 cm2. Each cell line grows at a different density and therefore the correct volume to resuspend cells in should be determined individually.\nSeed 0.3 × 106 cells/cm2 (48 well surface area = ∼1 cm2) in ≥400 μL of mTeSR + Y27632. Rock the plate in a “figure eight” movement to evenly distribute cells and leave to settle for 10–15 min before placing in the incubator.",
    "Note: It is crucial to start the differentiation with an even monolayer of cells. Carefully dissociating to a single cell solution is important as it allows for an accurate count and an even distribution upon seeding. It is equally important not to prolong exposure of the hPSCs to enzymatic dissociation as this will impair survival. The duration of enzymatic treatment and the balance between optimal dissociation and survival may vary between cell lines.\nNote: Initial seeding density should be optimized for each cell line to ensure confluency 24 h after seeding. Typically, we seed 0.2–0.4 × 106 cells/cm2. Trypan blue exclusion dye can be utilized during cell counting to ensure that only viable cells are included in the final cell seeding calculation.\nCritical: Seeding too many cells can lead to early detachment during differentiation, while seeding an insufficient number of cells can lead to poor survival and off-target differentiation.\nvmDA Progenitor Differentiation\nTiming: 13 days\nThis step describes the steps needed to differentiate hPSCs into vmDA progenitors.\nSee Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A for a schematic of the differentiation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/111-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Differentiation Overview and Morphological Changes during vmDA Differentiation\n(A) Schematic representation of the differentiation protocol indicating when each factor is added to the base media to appropriately pattern hPSC toward the vmDA lineage.\n(B) Morphological changes during differentiation. At day 3, the cells are a flat, uniform monolayer. By day 11, the density has increased, and the wells appear darker under the microscope. By days 18–20, fibers begin to appear as neurons accumulate and aggregate together and by day 25 vmDA neurons display extended axonal processes. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nDay 0: 24 h after seeding check under the microscope that hPSC have survived and appear as a single, confluent (≥95%) monolayer with no obvious differentiation or uneven distribution.",
    "Note: No (or very few small) gaps should be present the day after seeding the cells. If it is hard to see, wash twice with PBS−/− and check under the microscope. In addition, there should be very little death. If there is a large amount of death or cells are not confluent, it is best to discard the cells and start again.\nPrepare Induction Media and supplement with 10 μM SB431542 and 200 nM LDN193189, SMAD inhibitors of the Transforming Growth Factor-β and Bone Morphogenetic Protein pathways, respectively.\nGently wash each well twice with PBS−/− to remove residual mTeSR and replace media with 500 μL of supplemented Induction Media.\nDay 1: Change media to 500 μL Induction Media supplemented with 10 μM SB431542, 200 nM LDN193189, as well as ventralizing factors 100 ng/mL C25II SHH and 2 μM purmorphamine.\nDays 2 and 3: Change media to 500 μL (day 2) or 1 mL (day 3) Induction Media supplemented with 10 μM SB431542, 200 nM LDN193189, 100 ng/mL C25II SHH, 2 μM purmorphamine and 2.5 μM of the Wnt-agonist CHIR99021 to caudalize developing progenitors.\nNote: Media is changed every 24 h and 500 μL/48-well is added at days 0–2. At day 3 and beyond media is changed every other day and the volume is increased to 1 mL/48-well.\nDay 5: Change media to 1 mL Induction Media supplemented with 200 nM LDN193189, 100 ng/mL C25II SHH, 2 μM purmorphamine and 2.5 μM CHIR99021.\nDays 7 and 9: Change media to 1 mL Induction Media supplemented with 200 nM LDN193189 and 2.5 μM CHIR99021.",
    "Day 11: Wash cultures twice in PBS−/− and switch base media to Maturation Media with 20 ng/mL rhBDNF, 20 ng/mL rhGDNF, 0.1 mM dibutyryl cAMP, 200 nM Ascorbic Acid, 1 ng/mL rhTGFβ3, and 10 μM DAPT (Maturation Media + BGCATD), supplemented with 2.5 μM CHIR99021.\nOptional: Analyze cells at the end of progenitor patterning, day 13, for markers of vmDA progenitors by fixation and immunofluorescence or collection of cells for RT-qPCR. See below for the immunostaining protocol. By day 13 the majority (≥80%) of cells should co-express OTX2, FOXA2 and Nestin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A; Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]). Together, these markers indicate correct specification of ventral midbrain progenitors.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/111-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Characterization of Developing vmDA Progenitors and Neurons with 2.5 μM CHIR99021\n(A) Immunofluorescence analysis of developing vmDA progenitors differentiated from either H9:PITX3-eGFP or RM3.5:PITX3-eGFP using 2.5 μM CHIR99021. At day 13, vmDA progenitors should homogenously express OTX2, FOXA2 and Nestin, indicating correct midbrain floorplate lineage acquisition.\n(B) At day 25, vmDA neurons expressing FOXA2, PITX3, and TH should be readily observed if differentiation has been successful. Scale bar, 100 μm.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_111_5.csv\nExpression level: - none; +/- low; + moderate; ++ high; +++ very high.\nNote: If vmDA progenitors are too dense at day 13 for accurate quantification, it is possible to passage the cells with Accutase. If so, replate cells in Maturation Media + BGCATD, supplemented with 10 μM Y27632 at 0.3–0.45 × 106/cm2. Fix 24 h later, after cells have attached, for analysis or continued culture.\nCritical: Developing neural progenitors are extremely sensitive to CHIR99021 concentration. Take care when diluting new vials of CHIR99021 and precisely pipette the correct volume during the experiment. It is best to always add CHIR99021 on the day if possible.\nTerminal Differentiation and Long-Term Culture of vmDA Neurons\nTiming: 12+ days",
    "This step describes the long-term of culture of vmDA progenitors and the generation of vmDA neurons.\nDays 13–30. Change media every other day to Maturation Media + BGCATD.\nOptional: Transplantation of vmDA progenitors is optimal between days 13–22. Wash cells twice in PBS−/−, add 400 μL/48-well of Accutase and incubate for 7–10 min at 37°C. Monitor the wells closely under a microscope and test detachment every few minutes by gently pipetting the Accutase directly onto the cells. Once cells begin to detach, gently pipette using a P1000 to collect ≥90% of the well and further dissociate vmDA progenitors. Accutase can be left on for up to 20 min for slowly detaching, more dense cultures. Arrest enzymatic digestion when cells have dissociated into small (5–20 cell) aggregates by adding Maturation Media + BGCATD, supplemented with 10 μM Y27632 and centrifuge at 260 × g (3 min at 21°C). Aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in (1 mL/cm2) Maturation Media + BGCATD + 10 μM Y27632 and count viable progenitors using a hemocytometer and Trypan blue exclusion. Centrifuge at 260 × g (3 min at 21°C), aspirate supernatant, and resuspend at 0.1–0.2 × 106/μL in Maturation Media + BGCATD + 10 μM Y27632 and store on ice prior to transplantation.\nNote: From day 18–20, vmDA neurons will become increasingly abundant and can be indirectly observed by the formation of neuronal bunches and axonal projections. By day 25, these neuronal bundles become dense and highly arborized (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), making dissociation challenging and resulting in poor survival after plating and following transplantation. Viability when counting cells for further culture or transplantation should be ≥90%. Cells should not be stored on ice for >5 h.",
    "Optional: We routinely characterize our cultures at days 13, 16, and 25 to confirm the degree of vmDA specification and neuronal identity within the cultures. If desired, fix cultures or recover cells from wells at these stages for immunofluorescence and/or RT-qPCR. vmDA progenitors co-expressing LMX1A, EN1, NURR1 should be apparent by D16, and vmDA neurons co-expressing FOXA2 along with the postmitotic lineage markers PITX3 and TH should be readily apparent by D25 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B; Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\nFrom day 30 onwards, perform half-media changes, such that ∼400 μL is removed from each well and ∼500 μL of fresh, equilibrated media is added to maintain ∼1 mL/48-well. At these late stages of the differentiation, media changes can be done 2–3 times per week.\nNote: For in vitro studies of DA development, homeostasis, disease modeling, or for drug screening approaches, vmDA neurons can be cultured until at least day 60, at which point electrophysiologically active vmDA neurons will be present.\nCryopreservation of vmDA Progenitors\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes the protocol for generating frozen stocks of vmDA progenitors for downstream applications.\nNote: Cryopreserving vmDA progenitors between days 13 and 19 is ideal to balance lineage acquisition and survival.\nLabel cryovials and cool freezing container to 4°C.\nPrepare freeze media containing 20% DMSO and 60% KnockOut serum replacement and 20% fresh Maturation Media + BGCATD + 10 μM Y27632.\nNote: 0.5 mL of freeze media and 0.5 mL Maturation Media are needed per 1 mL cryovial. Typically, we cryopreserve vmDA progenitors at 3 × 106/mL.\nWash wells twice in PBS−/− and add 400 μL/48-well of Accutase. Place in incubator for 7–10 min. Monitor cell morphology closely under the microscope.\nDissociate cells by gentle pipetting using a P1000 and dilute Accutase in Maturation Media + BGCATD + Y27632.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 260 × g for 3 min, aspirate supernatant and resuspend in Maturation Media + BGCATD + 10 μM Y27632 (1 mL/cm2) at approximately 1 mL × 106/mL for accurate counting using a hemocytometer and Trypan blue exclusion.\nCentrifuge at 260 × g for 3 min, aspirate supernatant and resuspend in fresh Maturation Media + BGCATD + 10 μM Y27632 at 6 × 106/mL.\nTransfer 500 μL of the cell solution to each cryovial and add 500 μL of freeze media, pipetting twice to gently mix.\nRapidly move vials to the freezing container and place at -80°C.\nAfter ≥48 h, transfer cryovials to LN2 for long-term storage.\nPause Point: vmDA progenitors can be stored for periods ≥1 year.\nCritical: Ensure cells are exposed to Accutase for the minimum required time that still allows for accurate quantification. Maximizing the presence of small aggregates (2–10 cells) will improve cell survival. In contrast, over-dissociation in Accutase, leading to a high number of single cells, will significantly impair survival during thawing.\nRecovery of Cryopreserved vmDA Progenitors\nTiming: 30 min\nSee Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for an overview of vmDA progenitor maturation following thawing.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/111-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. vmDA Progenitors Can Be Cryopreserved and Thawed with High Viability\n(A) Differentiation schematic highlighting two time points where vmDA progenitors can be frozen and/or transplanted with high viability.\n(B) Live/dead analysis of DNA content using FACS highlights that cells are viable after cryopreservation at days 13 or 19.\n(C) By day 25, thawed and replated vmDA progenitors mature into FOXA2+/PITX3-eGFP+ vmDA neurons in vitro. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nThis step describes how to thaw cryopreserved vmDA progenitors for use in downstream applications.\nCoat 48-well plates with 10 μg/mL Laminin-521 and place in incubator for ≥2 h.",
    "Equilibrate 15 mL Maturation Media + BGCATD + 10 μM Y27632 at 37°C for ≥15 min.\nRapidly thaw a cryovial of vmDA progenitors in a 37°C water bath and transfer the contents to 10 mL of prewarmed media using a P1000 pipette.\nCentrifuge at 260 × g for 3 min, aspirate supernatant and resuspend in Maturation Media + BGCATD + 10 μM Y2732.\nPlate progenitors at 0.3–0.45 × 106/cm2.\nOptional: Count vmDA progenitors using a hemocytometer to ascertain an accurate count of surviving cells. Live/dead analysis using FACS can also be used with a subfraction of the cells, in addition to Trypan blue exclusion. Viability immediately post-thaw is typically 60%–70%, although a further proportion may undergo apoptosis after re-plating.\nOptional: Transplant vmDA progenitors directly after thawing. Wash once in PBS−/− after counting, centrifuge, aspirate supernatant and resuspend in Maturation Media + BGCATD + 10 μM Y27632 at 0.1–0.2 × 106/μL for transplantation.\nOptional: For long-term culture of vmDA neurons for studying development, drug screening, and/or disease modeling, wash cells once in PBS−/− the day after thawing and replace media with 1 mL fresh Maturation Media + BGCATD. Proceed with steps 14–15 to continue the differentiation.\nNote: The concentration of rhGDNF and Y27632 can be doubled to 40 ng/mL and 20 μM, respectively, if survival upon thawing is poor.\nImmunostaining of vmDA Progenitors and Neurons\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step outlines how to undertake immunocytochemical profiling of generated vmDA progenitors.\nWash wells once with PBS−/− to remove debris and add 200 μL 4% paraformaldehyde. Leave at 21°C for 10 min.\nAspirate paraformaldehyde and wash 3 times with PBS−/−, leaving wells in PBS−/− for at least 2 min between washes.",
    "Pause Point: Fixed plates can be stored for several months at 4°C. Addition of 0.05% Na-Azide to PBS−/− can reduce possible bacterial or fungal contamination if storing long-term.\nPrepare blocking buffer by adding 1 mL of species-specific serum (same as secondary antibodies) and 0.6 mL 10% Triton X-100 to 18.4 mL PBS-Azide 0.05%.\nAdd 200 μL/48-well of blocking buffer to each well for 30–60 min.\nDilute the primary antibodies in blocking buffer. Aspirate blocking buffer and add 200 μL/48-well of primary antibody solution. Incubate at 21°C for 12–18 h.\nWash wells 3 times in PBS−/− to remove primary antibodies and block cells again for 30–60 min by adding 200 μL blocking buffer.\nDilute appropriate secondary antibodies in blocking buffer and add 200 μL of secondary antibody solution to each well. Incubate cultures in the dark at 21°C for 1.5–2 h.\nWash wells in PBS−/− and add 1 μg/mL DAPI (diluted in PBS−/−) for 10 min.\nWash wells twice in PBS−/− and image.\nPause Point: Stained samples can be stored for a week at 4°C before imaging. It is best to store them in PBS−/− + 0.05% Na-Azide.\nNote: It is optimal to perform immunofluorescence immediately after fixation of the cells. If long-term storage is necessary, ensure sufficient PBS-Azide is added to each well (1 mL), to account for evaporation during refrigeration and minimize exposure to light to prevent fluorochrome fading."
