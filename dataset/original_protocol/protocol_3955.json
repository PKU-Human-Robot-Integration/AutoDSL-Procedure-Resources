    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBasic shuttling assays\nTiming: 1 day.\nTo follow a tagged protein that is expressed constitutively from its endogenous promoter.\nGrow two strains of cells (see above), one of which expresses a fluorescent nucleolar protein. One is MAT a and the other is MAT α.\nCombine aliquots of both parental cells (e.g., 100 μL of each). Vortex.\nSediment the cell mixtures and resuspend in synthetic medium with 2% glucose at OD600 ≈ 1.\nApply 25 μL samples of these mating mixtures to the surface of Petri dishes containing solid 2% agar in synthetic medium.\nLeave open in a laminar-flow hood. Liquid should be absorbed in < 15 min. The dishes are then covered. The overall timing of the cross is measured from the moment when the mating mixture is applied to the surface of the Petri dish.\nCritical: More time can be required for absorption if the volume of the samples is increased. In this event, the experiment will not be suitable for collecting kinetic information. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAfter 2 h at room temperature, recover the cell mixture by washing with synthetic medium and gentle pipetting up and down 4–5×. Under optimal conditions, many pre-zygotes and zygotes should be visible at this time; however, a majority of haploid cells will remain.\nCritical: Samples can be vortexed briefly but should not be sonicated. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSediment the cells. Without removing the supernatant, recover 0.5–1.0 μL samples of the cell pellet and apply this volume to the surface of freshly-opened Agarose pads, cover with a coverslip, and observe. For imaging in excess of 15 min duration, trim the pads to the dimensions of the coverslip with a single-edge razor blade (after adding the cells) and seal them with vaseline to minimize drying.",
    "Critical: Avoid nail polish or mounting media that include organic solvents since they will kill the cells.\nTo restrict attention to relatively early events, we examine zygotes that show no sign of bud emergence that coincides with onset of DNA synthesis (Sena et al., 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). We then focus on early zygotes that show evidence of nuclear fusion (redistribution of ER/NE markers). In our experience, once transfer of label begins, equilibration is reached within 10–15 min (Tartakoff et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). As is described below, control experiments need to be performed in parallel.\nIn these mating protocols, cell encounters, fusion and karyogamy are asynchronous, due to the variable proximity of potential mating partners and the fact that cell fusion can occur only when cells have reached the beginning of the cell cycle (Tartakoff, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20], Gammie and Rose, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Cells can be presynchronized, e.g., by exposure to α-factor which is then washed away when the two cell types are mixed. Alternatively, one can recover spent medium from cultures of MAT a and MAT α cells and use them to culture cells of the opposite mating type for 1–2 h. In our experience these procedures do not obviously increase the efficiency of zygote formation.\nTo follow tagged proteins whose expression can be repressed.\nPregrow one or both parental cells that expresses a tagged protein of interest from a repressible promoter, using a medium that allows expression (e.g., with galactose or lacking methionine).",
    "When the mating mixture is prepared, adjust the composition of the plate used for the cross to repress transcription, e.g., by addition of glucose or methionine. For the many nucleolar proteins that we have studied - judging from the restriction of label to a single nucleolus in [kar1Δ15 x wt] crosses - the rate of synthesis appears to be sufficiently low so that new synthesis is not a concern over the relevant time period (Tartakoff et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) - see below.\nRegardless of whether protein expression is repressed, intranuclear shuttling can be judged by determining whether the signal(s) that initially was in only one of the cells has become equally visible at both extremities of the elongated zygotic nucleus (i.e., in both of the nucleoli). In [wt x wt] crosses, cis-to-trans redistribution of nucleolar proteins begins once the two nuclei have contacted each other and in fact can be detected even before their zone of contact has visibly dilated (Tartakoff and Jaiswal, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nAccording to the goal of the experiments, evaluate possible shuttling either at a single time point or by time-lapse imaging. When only a single time point is needed, the samples can be fixed, as follows:\nPipette the mating mixture off the plate with complete medium.\nAdd 1/10 volume of formaldehyde from a 37% stock in water, shaking for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash once with growth medium to quench free aldehydes.\nPause point: Store samples in water at this point for 1–2 days at 4°C before examination.\nControl experiments\nTiming: 1 day.\nTo learn whether any appearance of fluorescent signal in the trans nucleus results from continued synthesis or nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, we can include two controls:\nFirst control.",
    "To learn whether transfer of label occurs before nuclear fusion, include a marker of the lumen of the nuclear envelope (and ER). This is either mRFP-HDEL or GFP-HDEL. The C-terminal HDEL peptide signal in conjunction with its receptor serves to retrieve cargo (mRFP, GFP) to the ER/NE if it reaches the Golgi (Semenza et al., 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). We find that the \"HDEL signal\" itself redistributes almost instantaneously upon cell-cell fusion We therefore transform cells with a centromeric plasmid encoding GFP-HDEL (pWP1055/pAT1182)(Prinz et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]), or an integrating plasmid encoding mRFP-HDEL (pTiKmRFP-HDEL/pAT1180) (Gao et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). We routinely include a HDEL marker in both [wt x wt] and [kar1 x wt] crosses.\nSince many ribosome assembly factors, in addition to being concentrated in the nucleolus, are present at low levels throughout the nucleoplasm or actually line the nuclear envelope (Tartakoff et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]), cis-trans continuity can often be evident without including an additional label (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/922-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Equilibration of the nucleolar protein, Mak11-GFP, in a [wt x wt] cross\nMating mixtures were applied to the surface of synthetic medium Petri dishes for 2, 3 or 4 h at room temperature and then examined. The brackets designate prezygotes and zygotes. The number of zygotes showing no transfer (a), transfer between separate nucleoli (b) or transfer and nucleolar fusion (c) is tabulated in the lower corners of the images. When relocation occurs, both nucleolar crescents become equally labeled. At 4 h, bud emergence is seldom visible. Strains: ATY8300, ATY3196.\nSecond control.",
    "Judge the possible contribution of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and new synthesis by following GFP-tagged AFs in crosses with a kar1Δ15 mutant, as described above. None of the dozens of nucleolar proteins that we have studied show labeling of both nuclei in such dikaryons over 2.5 h (Tartakoff et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) - Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/922-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative observations from a [kar1Δ15 x wt] cross after 4 h\nOne of the parental cells expressed Mak11-GFP and Sik1-mRFP, while the other expressed mRFP-HDEL. The pairs of nuclei are encircled by the mRFP-HDEL signal that also highlights the ER at the periphery of each cell. In each zygote, one nucleus shows the strong Mak11-GFP and Sik1-mRFP signals. The other nucleus is either unlabeled or is labeled much more weakly as designated (∗). The scale bar is 5 microns. er: endoplasmic reticulum, N1/N2: nuclei, v: vacuole.\nImaging\nTiming: 10 min–2 h\nThe number of early zygotes that can be imaged in a single field is difficult to control.\nCollect images of 3−10 fields and examine at least 25 zygotes per cross.\nUse a Deltavision RT epifluorescence microscope with an automated stage (Applied Precision, Inc) and an oil immersion objective (Olympus UPlanApo 100×/1.40; ∞/0.17/FN26.5).\nCapture z-stacks at 0.5–1.0 μm intervals using a CCD digital camera (Photometrics CoolSnap HQ). % transmission = 100%, exposure time 0.05–1 s, field 1040×1040 pixels, binning 1×1.\nExamine through-focal series spanning a total of 6 μ in all cases.\nRemove out-of-focus light using the Softworks deconvolution program (http://www.sussex.ac.uk/gdsc/intranet/pdfs/softWoRx[href=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/gdsc/intranet/pdfs/softWoRx] user manual.pdf).\nRepeat experiments 2–4 ×.
