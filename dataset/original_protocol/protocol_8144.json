    "1. Preparation of the Newborns\nNOTE: The procedure followed is innocuous and painless, so there are no counter-indications for evaluating full-term and preterm newborns, once they are clinically stable.\nEnsure two and half hour fasting and wakefulness before beginning the study, in neonates older than 40 weeks of postconceptional age.\nMake sure that the baby's head be washed with neutral soap the day before the study. Thus, his/her hair will be clean and dry. Do not apply conditioners.\nAllow the mother to start feeding the newborn 30 min before beginning the study. Allow him/her to burp and start the sleep wrapped in sheets. This will ensure that he/she sleeps easily and spontaneously.\nWash hands carefully before handling the neonate.\nUse sanitary masks.\nGently wipe the scalp of the newborn with a cotton ball or gauze soaked in alcohol to remove residual dirt and superficial grease, before the neonate falls asleep.\nMeasure the distance between nasion and inion, and between both pre-auricular pits. Calculate 10% and 20% to ensure proper placement of the cranial electrodes according to the international 10-20 system of electrode placement.\nCover the newborn's entire head with a tubular elastic mesh for the correct attachment of the electroencephalography (EEG) and VEP electrodes. Leave the face fully free and exposed, as shown in Figure 1.\nMark on the mesh the location of the surface electrodes.\nUse a swab to perfectly separate the newborn's hair at the sites where each electrode will be placed, and lightly rub the skin with abrasive gel for neurophysiological studies.\nNOTE: Reschedule the study if the neonate takes more than 2 h to fall asleep.\n2. Placement of the Surface Electrodes for EEG and VEP Sleep Recording",
    "NOTE: Before beginning, set the values of the instrument's frequency filters using the specifications in Table 1. It is advisable to connect all electrodes to the EEG and VEP instruments before placing them on the newborn.\nPlace the elastic band sensor on the baby's chest to record thoracic respiratory expansion.\nPlace the individual surface disc electrodes (standard silver-silver chloride, or gold disc electrodes) with conductive paste through the mesh to fix them in the cranial locations established by the international 10-20 EEG system, adapted for newborns.\nLocate the cranial electrodes for EEG at leads F3, F4, C3, C4, O1 and O2, or at least C3 and C4, referred to linked earlobes, to identify the stages of neonatal sleep.\nFix the surface disc electrodes to the skin with medical adhesive tape. To record ocular movements (EOG), place one electrode 1 cm above the external canthus of the left eye and place another 1 cm below the external canthus of the right eye, also referred to linked earlobes.\nSimilarly, attach the electrodes for surface electromyogram recording (EMG) on both sides of the chin, referenced against each other.\nUse two channels of the VEP equipment with the following leads: Oz (-) vs. Fz (+), and Oz (-) vs. A1 (+); the ground electrode is to be placed on the right mastoid.\nSet the analysis time for VEP registration in 600 ms.\n\tNOTE: Table 1 shows the filter settings used for recording sleep EEGs and VEPs.\nDo not begin VEP recording until impedance values are below 5 kΩ.\n3. Sleep Recording\nNOTE: VEPs are obtained while the newborn sleeps in hospital crib; the sleep stages are monitored simultaneously by polysomnography17,18.\nProlong the EEG recording for 60−90 min or until AS is identified, to evaluate active (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) in newborns.",
    "Begin EEG recording while carefully observing the characteristics of neonatal sleep, to identify the active sleep stage, during which VEPs will be recorded.\nIdentify neonatal sleep stages according to the criteria summarized in Table 2.\n4. VEP Recording\nNOTE: VEPs are registered according to established standards19,20.\nAllow one minute of EEG recording without visual stimulation when the neonate begins well-defined active sleep.\nApply monocular light stimulation through handheld goggles with a LED matrix held manually 2 cm directly above each newborn's eyes.\nObserve if the infant has his eyes closed during VEP registration in AS and note if this does not occur.\nBegin the averaging of the VEPs in the equipment, presenting 20 to 40 luminous stimuli whose corresponding recordings are averaged to obtain an average curve or evoked response.\nObserve the reproducibility of the recorded averages. At least two reproducible evoked potentials are recommended.\nVisually recognize PII component of the VEPs during recording, since this peak is considered typical of neonatal VEPs. Identify the PII component as the maximal positive peak between 120 and 300 ms, preceded by a negative wave (NII) and followed by a maximal negativity between 200 and 400 ms, also called NIII.\nStop the averaging of the VEPs if the newborn moves excessively, wakes up, or changes to another sleep stage, distinct from AS. Renew recording once the AS stage reestablishes.\nNOTE: This point is critical, because VEPs obtained during QS or transitional sleep are less reliable than in AS.\nFinish registration after 2 averages with reproducible VEP are attained, or when 6 averages occur without a recognizable VEP. In the latter case, consider the result an absence of a replicable response.\n5. Review and analysis of VEPs\nNOTE: Figure 2 shows the main components of neonatal VEPs and their measurements.",
    "Evaluate the reproducibility of the VEPs by similar appearance and measurements between the two averaged curves.\n\tNOTE: Some VEP recording systems offer a correlation measure between two averages.\nMeasure the absolute latencies of the NII, PII and NIII waves using the device's cursors. Absolute latency is the time in ms elapsed from the onset of stimulation to the maximal or minimal peak of each component.\nCalculate the interpeak latencies in ms, including the differences between the absolute PII-NII, NII-NIII and PII-NIII latencies.\nMeasure peak-to-peak amplitudes in µV, for the NII-PII and PII-NIII components.\nCompare the latency and amplitude values obtained to the normal, or expected, values estimated for a population of healthy, similar-age newborns.\nSubscription Required.
