    "All procedures described in this protocol have been performed in accordance with guidelines and regulations for the use of vertebrate animals, including prior approval by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Passivation of windows\nRinse the optical window frames (Supplemental Figure 2) with a 1% (w/v) solution of enzymatically-active detergent.\nInside a glass jar, submerge the optical window frames in 5% (w/v) sodium hydroxide solution for 30 min at 70 °C.\nRemove and wash the window frames with deionized water.\nInside a new glass jar, submerge the optical window frames in 7% (w/v) citric acid solution for 10 min at 55 °C.\nAgain, remove and wash the window frames with deionized water.\nRepeat step 1.2; then, remove and wash window frames with deionized water.\n2. Preparation for surgery\nConduct the surgery in a hood or laminar flow cabinet. To avoid contamination of the operative field, ensure distinct, separated areas for preparation, surgery, and recovery, respectively.\nIn advance of the surgery, sterilize all surgical instruments in an autoclave. If subsequent procedures are planned, re-sterilize instruments using a hot bead sterilizer. For this surgical procedure, a tips-only technique is used. \nPower on the heated surgical bead and bead sterilizer.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 5% isoflurane in the anesthesia chamber.\nTo remove hair, generously apply depilatory cream to the upper-left chest incision site. After no longer than 20 s, firmly wipe away hair and depilatory cream using moistened tissue paper. Repeat as necessary to remove all hair from the surgical site.\nUsing 2-0 silk suture, tie a knot at the base of a 22 G catheter, leaving 2-inch long tails (see Figure 1A).\n3. Lung window surgery\nWash hands using antiseptic soap.\nPrior to each new surgery, don new sterile gloves.",
    "To prevent corneal drying and damage to the mouse's eyes, apply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes.\nDilute 10 µL (0.1 mg/kg) of buprenorphine in 90 µL of sterile PBS, and then inject subcutaneously to ensure preoperative analgesia.\nIntubate the mouse with the silk suture-tied 22 G catheter15. Using an inflation bulb, confirm successful intubation by noting bilateral chest rise upon bulb squeeze.\nSecure the intubation catheter by tying the 2-0 silk suture around the mouse's snout (see Figure 1B).\nPlace the mouse onto the heated surgical stand and position it in the right lateral decubitus to expose the left thorax.\nConnect ventilator to the intubation catheter.\nEnsure controlled, stable ventilation on the ventilator and then lower the isofluorane to 3%. At the procedure's onset and periodically throughout the duration of the procedure, assess the adequacy of anesthesia by performing a toe pinch test.\nUsing paper tape, cranially and caudally secure the front and hind limbs, respectively, to the heated surgical stage. Place another piece of tape along the length of the mouse's back to maximize exposure to the surgical field (see Figure 1C).\nOpen all surgical instruments underneath the hood for the preservation of sterility.\nSterilize the surgical site by a generous application of antiseptic to the mouse's skin.\nUsing forceps, lift the skin and make an ~10 mm circular incision, ~7 mm to the left of the sternum and ~7 mm superior to the subcostal margin (Figure 1D).\nCarefully identify any major vessels. If the division of vessels is necessary, cauterize at both ends with the electrocautery pen to maintain hemostasis.\nExcise the soft tissue overlying the ribs.",
    "Elevate the 6th or 7th rib using forceps. Using a single blade of the blunt micro-dissecting scissors, the rounded side towards the lung, carefully pierce the intercostal muscle between the 6th and 7th ribs to enter the intrathoracic space (Figure 1E).\nDelicately discharge compressed air canister at the defect to collapse the lung and separate it from the chest wall. Fire the compressed air in short bursts to prevent iatrogenic lung injury.\nPlace the biopsy punch over the cutting tool (Supplementary Figure 1) and carefully maneuver the cutting tool's base through the intercostal incision (Figure 1F).\nOrient the base of the cutting tool such that it is parallel with the chest wall. Punch a 5 mm circular hole through the rib cage (Figure 1G).\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the exposed lung tissue is pink, without signs of damage.\nUsing the 5-0 silk suture, create a purse-string stitch ~1 mm from the hole, circumferentially, interlacing with the ribs (Figure 1H).\nPosition the window frame such that the edges of the circular defect align within the window's groove (see Figure 1I).\nSecurely lock the implanted window by tightly tying down the 5-0 silk suture.\nLoad 100 µL of cyanoacrylate gel adhesive into the 1 mL syringe.\nDry the lung by applying a steady gentle stream of compressed air for ~10-20 s (Figure 1J).\nUsing forceps to grip the window frame by its outside edge, gently lift to ensure separation of the lung from the undersurface of the window frame.\nDispense a thin layer of cyanoacrylate adhesive along the undersurface of the optical window frame (Figure 1K).\nIncrease the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the ventilator to inflate the lung.\nHolding for 10-20 s, apply gentle but firm pressure to attach the optical window frame onto the lung tissue (Figure 1L).",
    "Dispense a 5 mm drop of the remaining cyanoacrylate gel adhesive onto a rectangular coverslip.\nPick up the 5 mm coverslip using vacuum pickups. Dip the undersurface of the coverslip into the adhesive, and then scrape off excess adhesive three times against the side of the rectangular coverslip, such that only a very thin layer remains (Figure 1M).\nCarefully position the coverslip to fit inside the recess at the center of the optical window frame and is held above the lung tissue at an angle. Briefly clamp the ventilator to generate positive pressure, hyper-inflating the lung. Using a rotating motion, orient the coverslip parallel to the lung tissue to create direct apposition between the lung's surface and the undersurface of the coverslip. Maintain gentle pressure, allowing the cyanoacrylate adhesive to set (~25 s).\nUse the forceps to separate the coverslip from the vacuum pickups (Figure 1N).\nUsing 5-0 silk suture, again create a purse-string stitch, this time <1 mm circumferentially from the cut-edge of the skin incision. Tuck any excess skin underneath the outer rim of the window frame before tying it down tightly with locking knots.\nTo ensure an air-tight seal between the coverslip and the window frame, dispense a small amount of liquid cyanoacrylate at the metal-glass interface (see Figure 1O).\nAttach a sterile needle to a 1 mL insulin syringe. Insert the needle below the xiphoid process, advancing toward the left shoulder, entering the thoracic cavity through the diaphragm. Gently draw back on the syringe to remove any residual air from the thoracic cavity (see Figure 1P).\nRemove the tape from the mouse.\nTurn off isoflurane.\nContinue ventilation with 100% oxygen until the mouse appears ready to awaken.\nCarefully cut the 2-0 silk suture around the mouse's snout and extubate the mouse.",
    "Transfer the mouse to a clean cage and monitor until fully recovered. Euthanize the mouse if signs of difficulty in breathing are present.\nProvide postoperative analgesia by subcutaneously injecting 10 µL (0.1 mg/kg) of buprenorphine diluted in 90 µL of sterile phosphate buffered solution (PBS).\nSubscription Required.
