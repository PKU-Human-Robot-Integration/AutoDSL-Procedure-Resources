    "The Institutional Review Board at The College of St. Scholastica has approved the study under which this protocol was developed and tested.\n1. Fabrication of the visual screen\nCut the ¾ inch (1.9 cm) diameter PVC pipe into various lengths: two 30 inch (76.2 cm) pieces (screen base); two 8 inch (20.3 cm) pieces (screen base); one 44 inch (111.8 cm) piece (vertical screen support); and one 32 inch (81.3 cm) piece (screen fabric holder).\nPlace an end cap on one end of each 30 inch (76.2 cm) piece, and a 90° PVC elbow on the other end. Insert 8 inch (20.3 cm) pieces into the remaining open ends of both elbows. Connect open ends of the two 8 inch (20.3 cm) pieces with the PVC tee to create a screen base.\nInsert the 44 inch (111.8 cm) PVC piece into the vertical portion of the PVC tee to create a vertical support for screen. Place the 45° PVC elbow on the open end of the 44 inch (111.8 cm) piece. Insert the 32 inch (81.3 cm) piece into the open end of the 45° PVC elbow to create a screen fabric holder. Place an end cap on the open end of the 32 inch (81.3 cm) piece.\nPlace dishtowels on top of one another to ensure fabric opacity. Secure to the 32 inch (81.3 cm) piece with athletic tape. The fully assembled screen can be seen in Figure 1.\n2. Preparation of the testing equipment\nCalibrate electrogoniometer and electromyography (EMG) sensors according to the manufacturers’ instructions.\nTurn on the continuous passive motion (CPM) machine and activate Extension/Flexion mode. Program the CPM machine to move through 90° to 130° of elbow extension at a speed of 0.23°/s.\n3. Preparation of the participant for TDPM testing",
    "Seat the participant in a standard height chair (18 inch/45.7 cm), ensuring sitting with a straight back and feet flat on floor.\nVerbally prepare the participant for the EMG sensor and the electrogoniometer placement using a standardized script: “To begin, I am going to prepare your skin to attach sensors. They will help record movement and ensure your muscles are relaxed during the test. I’m going to mark landmarks on your arm and start attaching the sensors, so you can just relax in the position I place you in.”\nAttach the biceps brachii and the triceps brachii EMG sensors.\n\t\nManually resist elbow flexion to locate the biceps brachii muscle belly and mark the central point of the muscle belly with a small dot of washable marker to denote the location for the EMG sensor placement. Prepare the skin by removing the dead skin cells followed by scrubbing with an alcohol swab, and then attach the EMG sensor.\nManually resist elbow extension to locate the muscle belly of the lateral head of the triceps brachii and mark the central point in the bulk of the muscle belly with a small dot of washable marker to denote the location for the EMG sensor placement. Prepare the skin by removing dead skin cells followed by scrubbing with an alcohol swab, and then attach the EMG sensor.\nTest the EMG function by evoking an isometric biceps brachii contraction, followed by an isometric triceps brachii contraction, and observing for EMG activation.\nAttach the electrogoniometer to the participant.\n\t\nDetermine the midpoint of the dorsal aspect of the wrist and mark with a washable marker.\nPalpate the most prominent aspect of the lateral epicondyle and mark with a washable marker.",
    "Palpate the greater tubercle of the humerus and mark with a washable marker. Verify the greater tubercle location by passively moving the testing arm through internal and external rotation of the humerus as needed.\nAttach one end of the string to the lateral epicondyle mark using paper tape. Pull the string taut, connecting it with the dorsal wrist midpoint mark.\nTrace a line along the proximal forearm in line with the string using a washable marker.\nMove the free end of the string to the greater tubercle mark and pull the string taut.\nTrace a line along the distal humerus in line with the string using a washable marker, and then remove the string.\nPlace the distal paddle of the electrogoniometer along the path of the traced line, 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) distally from the lateral epicondyle mark.\nPlace the proximal paddle of electrogoniometer along the path of the traced line, 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) proximally from the lateral epicondyle mark. Secure the remaining components of the electrogoniometer to the skin using paper tape.\nPosition the participant’s upper extremity comfortably in the CPM machine.\n\t\nAdjust the height and orientation of the CPM machine to achieve a position of 90° sagittal plane shoulder flexion, 90° elbow flexion, and a neutral forearm. Align the participant’s lateral epicondyle with the rotational axis of the CPM machine.\nAdjust the CPM machine hand support to fit comfortably with the palm of the participant’s hand and secure the forearm via a wrist strap. Figure 1 shows the final participant setup for TDPM testing.\n4. Administration of the TDPM test",
    "Inform the participant of the testing procedure with the following standardized verbal information: “During this test, the machine is going to move very slowly to either straighten or bend your elbow. We will say “begin” at the start of each trial, there will be eight trials. When I say begin, the machine may or may not move your arm. Please press the button as soon as you feel your arm move, but only when you feel movement. If you don’t feel movement, we will stop the trial after a period of time; try to pay attention until we stop the trial. This is the button you’ll be using. Please press the button right now to test it.”\nHand the participant the electrogoniometer event marking trigger switch and test the switch.\nInform the participant of additional aspects of the procedure: “In between each trial, whether your arm moved or not, we will take your arm out of the machine and straighten it, and then place it back in the machine. Please remain relaxed. Do you have any questions about the test? We will be using this curtain to block your vision during this test and place this hearing protection over your ears to minimize any sounds you might hear during the testing.”\nOcclude visual input by blocking the view of the arm being tested and the CPM machine using a visual screen. Drape screen material at the participant’s shoulder to avoid sensory input during arm movement. Diminish auditory input by placing noise-cancelling headphones on the participant (see Figure 1).\nLoudly state “begin,” and wait the corresponding amount of time per trial before initiating movement of the CPM machine to decrease participant guessing when movement will begin19. Standardized delay times are shown in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\nTrial Number,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\nDelay (s),1,Catch,3,1,2,Catch,3,1",
    "Table 1: Standardized time delays and catch trial locations. Varied trial start time delays are included to prevent participant attempts to guess when movement will begin. Catch trials are included to test whether or not participant is actually detecting movement19,31.\nObserve for activation of biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles by monitoring EMG sensor feedback readings to ensure that the participant does not attempt to use active movement to assist in movement detection.\n\t\nIf muscle activation is noted, stop the trial and use the following standardized script: “Your muscles are activating. Please try to keep your arm relaxed during the test.” This trial should be noted for exclusion from data analysis, with the researcher proceeding with resetting the participant and CPM to start the next trial (protocol step 4.7).\nBetween each trial, remove the participant’s testing arm from the CPM machine and return the CPM machine to a 90° start position. Passively move the participant’s elbow through full extension and then back to 90° flexion to standardize the muscle spindle movement history27,28. Place the arm back in the CPM machine for the next trial.\nComplete eight trials, including two “catch” trials where the participant’s arm is not moved19. Terminate each trial (catch and non-catch) when the participant depresses the trigger switch, or after 15 seconds if the trigger switch is not depressed.\nIf during a catch trial a participant verbally reports they cannot feel movement, or depresses the trigger switch, use the following standardized response: “Your arm did not actually move during that trial. I know it’s hard to feel, the machine moves very slowly; try to concentrate and push the button as soon as you feel your arm move or that your arm position has changed.”\n5. Calculation of participant’s TDPM score",
    "Using the electrogoniometer tracing, identify the electrogoniometer angle measurement for the point at which the CPM machine movement started, and for the point at which the participant depressed the trigger switch indicating movement was felt. See Figure 2 for a representative example.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61391/61391fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Example electrogoniometer tracing with detection point. The electrogoniometer line tracing (green line), start point of the continuous passive motion (CPM) machine movement, and the point at which participant indicated movement was detected (first blue peak) are shown. The difference between electrogoniometer readings at the start of the trial (pink circle) and at detection point (orange circle) determines the TDPM value for that trial. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61391/61391fig02large.jpg]\nSubtract the starting angle from the final angle, thus identifying the number of degrees the CPM moved; this is the participant’s elbow TDPM value for that trial.\nTo determine participant’s overall TDPM score, remove the smallest and largest TDPM values from the six non-catch trials, and then average the remaining four trial scores29.\nSubscription Required.
