  "procedures": [
    "The use of animals in this protocol has been performed in accordance with procedures approved by the University of California Los Angeles Animal Care and Use Committee.\nNote: Begin by identifying the target murine population. In prior studies, only male wild-type C57/Bl6 mice have been used, however various transgenic or knockout mice can also be used. Note that stereotactic coordinates are based on C57/Bl6 anatomy. It is recommended that each user initially verify localization of the stroke to white matter.\n1. White Matter Stroke Induction - Medial Angled Approach\nBegin by preparing a pulled glass pipette using 0.5 mm capillary tube such that the distal diameter is between 15-25 µm 11.\nPrepare a sterile 10 µl aliquot of L-Nio (N(5)-(1)-iminoethyl-L-ornithine HCl) at 27.4 mg/ml (130 µM) in sterile 0.9% normal saline.\nPre-fill the pulled glass pipette with a small volume of L-Nio (2-5 µl) by affixing the glass pipette to tubing connected to a vacuum line. Lay the pipette flat on the bench top and insert the pulled end into the L-Nio solution.\n\t\nApply the vacuum until at least 2 mm of the 0.5 mm portion of the pipette is filled. Turn off the vacuum and withdraw the pipette. Place it aside until Step 1.12.\nPlace the mouse in an induction chamber and induce anesthesia of the mouse using standard 32% isoflurane flowed through a vaporizer (5 L/min inhaled with 5 L/min oxygen and 0.5 L/min N2) for 1 min or until deeply anesthesized. Transfer the mouse to a stereotactic apparatus equipped with a stereotactic microscope. Provide maintenance anesthesia using 32% isoflurane flowed through a vaporizer (2 L/min inhaled with 5 L/min oxygen and 0.5 L/min N2) and a nose cone. Check depth of anesthesia with a toe pinch. \nAdjust the injection arm to 36°.",
    "Affix a pulled glass pipette holder to the distal end of a low volume pressure injection system and attach it to the injection arm of the stereotactic setup.\nCoat the anesthetized animal's whiskers with petroleum jelly and place artificial tear ointment over both eyes. Prepare a sterile surgical field by placing a sterile drape over the animal's head with a 5-10 cm opening over the head. Prepare an aspetic surgical surface by shaving the fur overlying the skull. Clean the scalp with alternating betadine and 70% alcohol swabs.\nMake a 1.5 cm midline scalp incision with sterile fine scissors to expose the skull surface. Dry the skull with a sterile cotton swab and using a stereotactic microscope at 1-3X magnification, remove any overlying periosteal tissue using a sterile micro point tool.\nMark the Bregma as a reference point using a fine point marker.\nDrill a 2 mm ellipitical craniotomy using a sterile fine stip surgical drill bit beginning posteriorly at the Bregma and extending anteriorly just left of the midline. Remove bone fragments and overlying soft tissue so that the cerebral cortex can be visualized.\nKeep the surgical field and cortical surface moist by intermittently applying drops of sterile saline.\nAffix a pulled glass pipette to the injector arm of the stereotactic apparatus. Align the distal end of the pipette with the Bregma and zero the stereotactic coordinates.\nAdvance the pipette to the first anterior/posterior (A/P) and medial/lateral (M/L) coordinates provided in Table 1.\nAdvance the pipette to the cortical surface and zero the dorsal/ventral (D/V) measurement.\nSlowly pass the pipette into the brain until reaching the first D/V coordinate in Table 1.",
    "Using a low volume pressure injection system set at 20 psi for 20 msec pulses, inject 100 nl of L-Nio into the brain and wait 5 min to prevent reflux up the pipette track.\n\t\nUse a calibrated reticle in the eyepiece of the stereotactic microscope and a magnification of 3X.\nAccordingly, displace a total of 0.100 mm3 (0.5 mm length in a 0.5 mm diameter pipette, corresponding to 100 nl) from the pulled glass pipette for each set of coordinates. By using an reticule, measure and standardize since each set up varies depending on the magnification and scales used.\nFor accurate volume measurement during each injection, approach the angled pipette with the microscope from the side so that the air-fluid meniscus has a sagittal view. The meniscus should appear in the same focal plane of both the inner and outer wall of the pipette.\nSlowly withdraw the pipette and repeat steps 1.13-1.16.3 at the second and third set of coordinates provided in Table 1.\nAfter the final injection, remove the pipette and place enough bone wax to fill the craniotomy site. Approximate the edges of the scalp wound and bind with dermal adhesive.\nInject 0.1 ml of 0.5% Marcaine into the wound margins using a sterile 30 G needle to prevent to prevent local pain associated with the scalp incision.\nReturn the animal to housing and supply post-operative antibiotics (0.48 mg/ml trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or 0.5 mg/ml Levofloxacin) in the drinking water for 5 days.\n2. White Matter Stroke Induction - Posterior Angled Approach\nPerform steps 1.1-1.12 as in the medial angled approach protocol, except adjust the injection arm of the stereotactic setup to 45 degrees oriented anterior to posterior.\nAdvance the pipette to the first A/P and M/L coordinates provided in Table 2.",
    "Complete remaining steps 1.14-1.20 as in the lateral angled approach protocol.\n3. Retrograde Neuronal Labeling\nPrepare a sterile 10 µl aliquot of L-Nio at 54.8 mg/ml in 0.9% normal saline.\nPrepare a sterile aliquot of 20% Fluororuby (or 20% biotinylated dextran amine or 2% Fluorogold) in 0.9% normal saline.\nDilute together 1:1 for final concentrations of 27.4 mg/ml L-Nio and 10% Fluororuby.\nPerform the stroke protocol as above in steps 1.3-1.23.\nVisualize the natively fluorescent tracer in tissue section by perfusion fixation, cryosectioning and microscopy as previously described8.\n4. Tissue Processing for Immunofluorescence\nAt an appropriate post-stroke interval ranging from 3 hr to 14 days after stroke, euthanize mice via isoflurane overdose or local IACUC approved procedure.\nOpen the thoracic cavity using angled scissors and insert a 23 G butterfly needle into the left ventricle.\nPlace a small cut in the right atrium using fine scissors to allow an outflow track for the perfusion fluid.\nTranscardially perfuse with 30-40 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by 30-40 ml of cold 4% paraformaldehyde at a rate of 10 ml/min at RT.\nDecapitate the mouse and remove the brain using sterile scissors to open the skull posteriorly and then gently remove the overlying skull with a spatula, place the brain into cold 4% PFA for 24 hr, and then transfer to 30% sucrose in PBS for 48 hr.\nPrepare forty micron floating sections using a cryostat and perform antibody processing as previously described 6-8. In this study, use the following antibodies: rabbit anti-neurofilament 200 (1:500 dilution); rabbit anti-vimentin (1:500); goat anti-GFAP (1:500); rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:1,000).\n5. Tissue Processing for Protein or RNA Analysis\nAt an appropriate post-stroke interval ranging from 3 hr to 14 days after stroke, euthanize via isoflurane overdose or local IACUC approved procedure.",
    "Decapitate the mouse and remove the brain using sterile scissors to open the skull posteriorly and then gently remove the overlying skull with a spatula.\nInsert a sterile 4 mm spatula at the front of the brain to sever the olfactory bulb and optic nerves. Gently lift the brain out of the calvarium and place into ice-cold dissection buffer (1x Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 35 mM glucose, 4 mM sodium bicarbonate, and 0.01 mg/ml cyclohexamide).\nUsing a brain block and sterile new razor blades, prepare 2-3 mm slabs containing the stroke and place into cold dissection buffer.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, identify the white matter underlying motor cortex in the injected hemisphere. At longer post-stroke intervals, the region may be visually identified by focal necrosis and myelin pallor.\n\tNote: At earlier post-stroke intervals, injection of L-Nio mixed with 1 µl of 10% Fast Green can allow visual identification of the stroke (Figure 4A).\nUnder guidance of a dissecting microscope and using a fresh scalpel, carefully dissect the region of white matter containing the stroke, identified by either Fast Green labeling or tissue loss. Remove overlying cortex and underlying striatum as desired.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
