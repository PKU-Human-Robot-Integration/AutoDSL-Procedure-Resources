    "Ethics statement: since the clinical application of the protocol requires the use of cutaneous autologous tissue of the patient, its characterization in vitro was performed before clinical use on homologous cutaneous tissue at Emilia Romagna Regional Skin Bank following the guidelines of National Rules on harvesting, processing and distributing tissues for transplantation (CNT 2013).\n1. Bio-complex Building for Clinical Application\nNOTE: This protocol is clinically based on the use of Rigeneracons (tissue disruptor) and the Rigenera Machine (tissue disruptor system) (Figure 1A). The tissue disruptor is a biological medical disruptor of human tissues able to disrupt small pieces of tissues using a grid provided by hexagonal blades and filtering cells and components of extracellular matrix with a cut-off of about 50 microns.\nCollect skinsamples of the patient through a biopsy punch (Figure 1B) and disaggregate adding 1 ml of saline solution for each piece to obtain autologous micro-grafts 6,7,9 (or see step 2.1).\nPlace 1 ml of micro-grafts on collagen sponges (Figure 1C) toform bio-complexes to use for clinical application.\nCulture another 1 ml of micro-grafts on collagen sponges in the presence of 6 ml of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.\nFollowing 3 days of culture, fix the bio-complexes with 0.3% Paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. Pour the paraffin with a specific dispenser directly onto the sample. Obtain slices with a microtome with a thickness of 5 µm and put directly in a glass-slide.",
    "Immerse paraffin slices of 5 µm in a glass for histological analyses, containing 15 - 20 ml Xylene (commercially available - a mix of m-xylene (40 - 65%), p-xylene (20%), o-xylene (20%) and ethyl benzene (6 - 20%) and traces of toluene, trimethyl benzene, phenol, thiophene, pyridine and hydrogen sulfide) for 3 min each.\nImmerse the slices in decreasing grades (100% to 70%) of ethanol (100% ethanol for 1hr, 95% ethanol for 1 hr, 80 % ethanol for 1hr, 70% ethanol for 1 hr) and then deionized water for de-paraffinizing and rehydrating the sections.\nStain the sections with 1 - 2 ml of 1g/L Ematoxylin for 1 - 2 min and subsequently rinse in water to remove any Ematoxylin surplus.\nStain the sections for 4 - 5 min with Eosin Y alcoholic solution at 1% of concentration mixed with ethanol 70% and diluted in water.\nUse 1 - 2 ml of Eosin Y for each slide section and rinse under running tap water.\nImmerse sections in increasing grades of ethanol (see step 1.6) and finally, after a passage in Xylene for 1h, coverslip with a based-mounting mediumand observe under a light microscope at 100X magnification (Figure 1D).\n2. Collection, Disaggregation and In Vitro Analysis of the Tissues\nUsing a dermatome, take independent skin tissue, papillary de-epidermized dermis (Ded) or reticular dermis (Dermis) respectively of 0.6 mm, 1 mm or 2 mm in thickness from the trunk area of 4 different multi-organ and/or multi-tissue donors in a range from 40 to 55 years, following National Rules on harvesting, processing and distributing tissues for transplantation (CNT 2013).\n\t\nGently rinse all samples in 0.9% NaCl solution putting them in a dish on an orbital shaker for 5 min.",
    "Using the 5-mm biopsy punch, create samples which are uniform in diameter from the skin tissue, Ded and Dermis and weigh all tissue specimens before the disaggregation.\nInsert eight, three or four uniform samples of skin tissue, Ded or Dermis respectively, in the tissue disruptor, adding 1.5 ml of saline solution for the disaggregation.\nPerform different times of disaggregation for all tissue samples as indicated in Table 1.\nUse a correspondent number of punch biopsies derived from intact tissue samples as controls.\nAfter mechanical disaggregation, aspirate the saline solution containing micro-grafts and place separately each sample in a single well of a 12-well plate. Perform the same protocol for intact control punch biopsies.\nAdd 1ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics to each sample.\nEvaluate the cell viability immediately. To each well containing a micro-graft (obtained by the simultaneous disaggregation of eight, three or four uniform samples of skin tissue, Ded or Dermis respectively) add 1ml of medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution and incubate for 3 hr at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/air. Perform the same protocol for intact control punch biopsies.\nAfter incubation, remove all medium containing MTT and add to each sample 1 ml dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 10 min.\nTransfer each sample and DMSO in a cuvette and read at optical density (OD) at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer. Calculate cell viability as the ratio of absorbance at 570 nm and the weight in grams (gr) of tissue used before disaggregation. Perform the same protocol for intact control punch biopsies.\nAfter mechanical disaggregation, aspirate the saline solution containing micro-graft derived from skin tissue, Ded and Dermis samples of a single donor.",
    "Place separately each sample in a single well of a 12-well plate or in a culture flask for cell viability test and morphological analysis respectively.\nCulture micro-grafts adding 1 ml (12-well plate) or 5 ml (culture flask) of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/air for 24 hr or 7 days.\nEvaluate the cell viability after 24 hr or 7 days (repeat steps 2.1.8-2.1.10).\nPerform morphological analysis evaluating the presence of cell suspension by light microscopy after 24 hr and 7 days of culture in flask.\nAnalyze the samples of Dermis for positivity to the mesenchymal and hematopoietic cell markers, including CD146, CD34 and CD45 antigens by FACS analysis 6.\nUnder laminar flow hood seed each micro-graft (obtained by the simultaneous disaggregation of eight, three or four uniform samples of skin tissue, Ded or Dermis respectively) and a correspondent small fragment of each tissue sample not totally disaggregated (>50 micron in size after disaggregation process) on Columbia agar plate containing 5% sheep blood broth 100 µl.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C for three days and perform microbiological analysis on Columbia agar plate in order to assess the sterility11.\nSubscription Required.
