    "P. pastoris expression vectors are built on a classical E. coli/yeast shuttle model with components required for E. coli amplification (classically one origin of replication and one antibiotic selection marker) and specific elements for heterologous gene expression in P. pastoris. These typically include a selectable auxotrophy marker and/or an antibiotic resistance bacterial gene, as well as a promoter and a terminator sequence that surround a cloning cassette and optional fusion sequences added to improve the yields and proper folding of the expressed proteins and to facilitate their detection and their purification. Most of these vectors are built on, or derived from, the pPIC series of plasmids and are commercially available (e.g., Invitrogen). Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-tbl-0001] summarizes the vectors most frequently employed for the expression of IMPs.\nTable 1.\n                Pichia pastoris Expression Vectorsa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-tbl1-note-0001_19]\ntable:\n﻿Name,Selection markers,Phenotype of transformants,Promoter,Secretion sequence,Added tags\npAO815,HIS4,His+,PAOX1,none,none\npPIC3.5K,\"HIS4, Kan\",\"His+, G418R\",PAOX1,none,none\npPIC9K,\"HIS4, Kan\",\"His+, G418R\",PAOX1,α Factor,none\n\"pPICZ A, B, C\",Ble,ZeoR,PAOX1,none,c-Myc/His6\n\"pPICZα A, B, C\",Ble,ZeoR,PAOX1,α Factor,c-Myc/His6\npPink-HC,ADE2,Ade+,PAOX1,none,none\npPinkα-HC,ADE2,Ade+,PAOX1,α Factor,none\na HIS4 gene from P. pastoris, encodes a histidinol dehydrogenase and restores histidine prototrophy (His+); Kan gene, confers resistance to G418 (G418R); Ble gene from Streptoalloteichus hindustanus, confers resistance to Zeocin (ZeoR); ADE2 gene from P. pastoris, encodes a phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, restore adenine prototrophy; PAOX1, promoter sequence of the AOX1 gene from P. pastoris encoding an alcohol oxidase; α Factor, encodes the native S. cerevisiae α factor secretion signal; c-Myc, C-terminal myc epitope, EQKLISEEDL; His6, hexahistidine tag.\nDesigning the expression vector",
    "The first decision in setting up a P. pastoris expression system is the choice of the expression vector(s) that will be best adapted to a specific IMP. Usually there are two scenarios: no information is available in the literature, or similar proteins have already been successfully produced in this system and the published data can serve as a useful starting point. In the latter case, it is advisable to consult the few authoritative surveys that have been conducted on various IMPs expressed in P. pastoris (Alkhalfioui et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0001]; Bill & Hedfalk, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0008]; Byrne, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0012]; Hausjell et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0037]; Popova et al., 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0052]). When no published information is available, a combination of vectors that comprise the following sequence elements must be considered. First, plasmids bearing the HIS4/Kan or the ble selection markers are generally preferred. Similarly, the inducible PAOX1 promoter from the alcohol oxidase AOX1 gene of P. pastoris is also favored. Among the panel of constitutive and inducible promoters that are available in expression vectors, PAOX1 is one of the most tightly repressed by sugar-based carbon sources and strongly induced by methanol (Ata et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0003]; Hartner & Glieder, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0035]), allowing a finely controlled and efficient overexpression of IMPs that may be toxic to the host. Additional methanol-regulated and potent promoters have been recently investigated (Vogl et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0062]), but not yet used for the recombinant expression of IMPs.",
    "The sequences that can be fused to the IMP gene are usually very dependent on the particular protein, with various impacts. For instance, adding a secretion sequence, such as the alpha-factor secretion signal from S. cerevisiae, may be highly beneficial for some IMPs, such as the seven transmembrane (7TM) GPCRs (Grunewald et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0029]; Weiss et al., 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0066]; Weiss et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0067]). Alternatively, for several 6TM aquaporins where the N and C termini are both located intracellularly, protein expression led to high yields of high-quality protein suitable for structural studies, whether a secretion signal was present or not (Fisher et al., 2009[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0024]; Tornroth-Horsefield et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0060]).\nSimilarly, various tag sequences can be inserted to improve the downstream detection and purification steps. While it is difficult to decide on the best sequence and position to use, an ideal tag should have (1) no effect on the tertiary structure and the biological activity of the protein; (2) suitability with the shortest, affinity-based purification strategy; and (3) easy and specific removal to recover the native protein for further use. A large panel of such tags has been used with IMPs, ranging from hexa- or decahistidine (the most widely employed tags), c-Myc, FLAG, HA and StrepII epitopes, to larger peptidic domains such as a biotinylation domain (bio) and the green fluorescent protein GFP. It is noteworthy that C-terminal bio fusions have been shown to enhance the functional expression of GPCRs (Grunewald et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0029]; Weiss et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0067]). In addition, protease cleavage sites, such as the factor-Xa or TEV sequences inserted in some constructs, are sometimes included in the constructs for eliminating the fused tags after or during the purification step.\nCloning into the expression vector",
    "Once the expression vector(s) has been chosen, cloning is the next step. Basically, this is achieved by directly introducing the gene of interest into either a standard ready-made expression vector (see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-tbl-0001]), or after modifying one of these vectors to incorporate any chosen additional or alternate fusion sequence(s). In both cases, the final constructs can be obtained by common cloning strategies, such as subcloning DNA fragments, insertion of PCR fragments, or recombinational cloning.\nAs an illustration of how to handle such a task, the following sections present the information and protocols needed for the cloning of a member of the human GPCR family into an engineered pPIC9K plasmid. This vector was modified to incorporate a FLAG-tag, a TEV protease cleavage sequence and a decahistidine-tag (His10) upstream the BamHI and SpeI cloning sites for insertion of the target gene, as well as a second TEV site and a bio-tag downstream (André et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0002]). This combination was selected on the basis of previous studies showing dramatically enhanced expression levels of other GPCRs when fused to the α-MF signal sequence and the bio-tag (Grunewald et al., 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0029]; Weiss et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0067]). The FLAG and His10 tags were inserted for detection and purification purposes; the TEV cleavage sites were added to allow cleavage of the N- and C-terminally fused sequences following purification. The protocols below illustrate a standard way to generate the desired P. pastoris expression plasmid, as well as its preparation prior to yeast transformation. The human alpha-1A adrenergic receptor is employed as an example.\nMaterials\ncDNA template containing the full-length ADRA1A_HUMAN encoding gene (cDNA Resource Center, cat. no.

Thoroughly mix by vortexing and store up to several years at –80°C.",
    "As for the majority of the available expression vectors, those used for IMP expression are designed to be integrated in the genome of P. pastoris. Following yeast transformation, recombination events between linearized sequences borne by the plasmids (typically HIS4 or PAOX1) and their homologous sequence counterparts in the genome result in targeted insertion of the expression vectors into the P. pastoris genome. Moreover, such plasmid insertions frequently occur in tandem in yeasts and thus lead to multiple integration of the gene of interest with an associated impact on subsequent expression levels.\nIn an alternative strategy, integration can be obtained by replacing the P. pastoris AOX1 gene by the construct of interest, leading to clones exhibiting a reduced growth speed on methanol-containing media (methanol utilization slow –MutS phenotype). Such a gene replacement strategy is, however, not recommended for IMP expression. For a complete overview of the different existing integration possibilities and methods, see Cregg et al. (2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0019]).\nThe strains usually employed for heterologous expression of IMPs (see Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-tbl-0002]) are all histidine auxotrophs due to a deficiency in the histidinol dehydrogenase gene (his4). The prototrophy for histidine can be restored upon transformation with pPIC vectors bearing the HIS4 gene, thereby serving as a positive selection marker. Strains from the SMD series bear additional deficiencies in endogeneous proteases and are often preferred for this convenient phenotype. Additional engineered strains have been described, notably for their capacity in performing “human-like” N-glycosylation (Hamilton & Gerngross, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0031]), but none of them have been reported yet in IMP expression studies.\nTable 2.\n                Most Commonly Used P. pastoris Strains for IMP Expressiona[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-tbl2-note-0001_44]\ntable:\n﻿Strain,Genotype,Phenotype,Reference\nGS115,his4,\"Mut+, His-\",Cregg & Madden (1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0018])\nKM71,\"his4, arg4, aox1::ARG4\",\"MutS, His-, Arg+\",Cregg & Madden (1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0018])\nSMD1163,\"his4, pep4, prb1\",\"Mut+, His-, Prot- (A-, B-, CarbY-)\",White et al.

It is convenient to carry out, it yields transformants at high frequencies, and it is compatible with multicopy integration events.

    "9. Air dry the pellet for 15 min and then resuspend in 15 μl sterile H2O.\n10. Check the DNA linearization by loading 1 μl of the solution on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel.\nWhen the plasmid is correctly linearized, one single DNA band of the corresponding size should be observed.

It is important to keep in mind that this relation stays proportional for OD600 values below 0.3. In case of higher values, the cell density will be underestimated. To avoid this, measure OD600 of a 10- or 100-fold diluted solution.\n13.

Adjust the electroporation settings as follows: 1 500 V, 25 μF, 600 Ω.\n26. Place the cuvette in the electroporator chamber and apply the electric pulse.\n27. Immediately resuspend the electroporated mixture in 1 ml of ice-cold 1 M sorbitol and transfer into a sterile 1.5-ml microtube.\n28. Allow the cells to recover for ∼1 hr at 30°C then pellet the cells by centrifuging 5 min at 4000 × g, room temperature.\n29. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 μl of 1 M sorbitol. Proceed to step 30.\nSelect the recombinant clones",
    "In the present protocol involving a pPIC9K-derived expression vector bearing both the HIS4 and KanR markers, the selection of the recombinant clones is managed in two steps. The first one corresponds to the selection of His+ transformants growing on minimal medium (MD) agar plates, and the second is dedicated to the identification of multicopy transformants resistant to increased concentrations of the G418 sulfate antibiotic contained in YPD plates. In the present case, as the SMD1163 strain is more sensitive to G418 sulfate because of the prb1 and pep4 mutation it bears, a concentration range of antibiotic comprised between 0.05 and no more than 0.25 mg/ml is usually applied. In addition, whatever the strain used, the direct selection of transformants on G418 sulfate is not recommended, mainly because the level of resistance is dependent on the cell density and false positive clones may be isolated.\n30. Spread separately 50 μl and 450 µl of electro-transformed cells on each of two MD plates and incubate for 2 to 3 days at 30°C.\n31. Harvest the His+ transformants by adding 1 ml YPD medium onto the plates and scrape off all the clones using a sterile scraper.\n32. Perform 10× and 100× dilutions in YPD and measure the OD600 for each dilution.\n33.

    "35. Pick six to twelve representative colonies from the different G418 sulfate concentration plates, streak them onto a fresh YPD plates and let them grow for 1 to 2 days at 30°C. Directly use these colonies for further expression tests (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0003]) and/or resuspend them in 1 ml sterile YPD supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol and store them up to several years at –80°C.",
    "Once transformants have been obtained, the next step consists of screening for the clones exhibiting the best expression levels of the recombinant IMPs. As mentioned previously, tandem multicopy integration is indeed relatively frequent in the transforming conditions used, leading to recombinant clones with a variable number of copies of the expression vector. However, a high number of integrations does not necessarily correlate with higher expression levels, so several representative clones typically need to be assayed. For expression based on PAOX1-dependent vectors, this is practically achieved by growing the clones in repressive medium to an appropriate cell density and growth phase before starting the expression phase by transferring the cells to a methanol-containing induction medium. For clones and expression condition screening, small-scale culturing procedures most often rely on shaken baffled-flasks or tubes of smaller volumes, provided an appropriate aeration is maintained. Such a standard procedure is described below.\nWhen upscaling the production of IMPs to larger amounts (in the mg range), shake-flask culturing is often still the method of choice. Alternatively, when expression levels are low, when large volumes of culture are required (> 10 L), or when experimental parameters need to be finely monitored (oxygen transfer, pH, substrate feeding), bioreactors can be employed. Accordingly, a number of robust fermentation processes including fed-batch techniques or continuous culturing procedures have been developed. Detailed descriptions of these methods with their benefits and limitations can be found in several excellent and comprehensive publications (Cos et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0017]; Li et al., 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0042]; Looser et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0045]), including for IMP production (Singh et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0057]).\nMaterials\nBMGY medium (see recipe)\nRecombinant clones (from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0002]) freshly streaked on a YPD agar plate\nBMMY medium (see recipe)\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (e.g., Euromedex, cat. no.

    "1. Inoculate 50 ml of freshly prepared BMGY medium in a 500-ml baffled-flask with a fresh recombinant colony isolated on a YPD agar plate. Incubate overnight on a shaker at 250 rpm, 30°C.\n2. On the next day, measure OD600 of the culture. Dilute the cells into 50 ml fresh BMGY medium in a 500-ml flask to achieve an OD600 of 1 (∼5.107 cells/ml) and incubate on a shaker at 250 rpm, 30°C.\n3. When the culture reaches ∼5 OD600 (∼4 to 5 hr later), pellet the cells by centrifuging in sterile tubes for 5 min at 4000 × g, room temperature.\n4.

For optimal aeration of the clones during induction, it is important to maintain at least a 1:5 ratio between the volume of the yeast culture and the total volume of the selected vessel.",
    "The first critical step when preparing P. pastoris membranes is a robust cell lysis method that effectively disrupts the thick protective cell wall. Shearing-based methods involving microbeads are preferred since they are very efficient, compatible with a broad range of sample volumes, and directly accessible to most laboratories. In the simplest and widest-used mode, cells in cold buffers are violently shaken with 500-μm diameter beads using a basic vortex apparatus in 4 to 8 cycles of alternating shaking (30 s) and ice-cooling (30 s) phases. To achieve the most reliable and reproducible results, programmable equipment is recommended, such as the Tissue Lyser from Qiagen or the FastPrep 24 from MP Biomedicals that accommodate various sample volumes and formats (up to 50 ml), or the more sophisticated and expensive grinder series from Dyno Mills that can operate large volumes both in batch or continuous modes. In addition, pressure-based instruments have also proven efficient for the lysis of P. pastoris cells, and besides the well-known French pressure cell press, a panel of cell disruptors is available from Constant Systems that can handle from 0.5 to 40 ml of batch samples, and up to 24 L/hr with the continuous flow models. Here again, programmable equipment is recommended for reproducible results. Alternative methods can involve glucanase enzymes (e.g., Helicase from snail digestive juice, Zymolyase or Lyticase from microbial sources) to remove the cell wall and yield protoplast preparations that can be easily burst (Hartmann et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0034]).\nOf importance, keep in mind that the longer the induction phase, the thicker the cell wall and the less efficient the lysis step. This issue must be considered when optimizing the induction time in order to strike a balance between expression level and cell lysis efficiency.",
    "Following cell disruption in the presence of protease inhibitors (typically PMSF or other commercially available cocktails), the unbroken cells and large debris are separated from the lysate with a low-speed centrifugation step (typically 10 min at 2000 × g). The whole membrane fraction in the supernatant is then pelleted by ultracentrifugation before being resuspended in an appropriate buffer for further analysis. Optionally, cycles of ultracentrifugation and stringent washes may be applied to eliminate unwanted membrane-associated proteins, resulting in samples enriched with the IMP of interest.\nDescribed below is a protocol optimized for the preparation of membranes of P. pastoris using a bead-based disruption method and standard centrifugation procedures.\nMaterials\nYeast cell pellet (from Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0003])\nTNGE buffer (see recipe)\nAcid-washed glass beads (425- to 600-µm diameter, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

    "Expression levels of IMPs are usually assessed through specific immunodetection tests and activity assays. Immunodetection methods, such as western blot, dot blot, or ELISA are rather straightforward for evaluating the overall amounts of produced IMP. This is facilitated by the presence of a tag epitope fused to the protein of interest (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0001]), particularly when no specific antibody is commercially available, which is a recurrent issue with IMPs.\nThis protocol presents a western blot protocol where the expression level analysis of an IMP is illustrated with the His-tagged human ABHD12 monoacylglycerol lipase after a denaturing SDS-PAGE.\nMaterials\nMembrane preparation samples (from Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0004])\nBlocking buffer (see recipe)\nMonoclonal anti-His antibody from mouse (e.g., Qiagen Penta-His antibody, cat. no. 34660)\nBlotting buffer (see recipe)\nIRDye800-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (e.g., Euromedex, cat. no.

    "While western blot analysis (Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0005]) yields useful information on both the expression levels and the size and integrity of the immunodetected protein of interest, the throughput is generally low. Actually, SDS-PAGE separation and protein transfer onto western blotting membranes require a number of handling steps that are not adapted for the comparison of dozens of samples obtained from a large panel of recombinant IMP-expressing clones. In such a situation, screening for the best expressing clones can be more readily achieved by a dot blot approach, as it has been validated for GPCR expressing clones (Zeder-Lutz et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0073]).

    "As exemplified above, dot blot immunodetection is well-suited for screening purposes but is limited by the low throughput of all the manipulations required for sample preparation, from clone culturing and induction in liquid formats, to cell harvesting, cell lysis, and whole membranes isolation steps. The yeastern blot protocol presented below was developed for overcoming this issue (Hartmann et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0033]). Recombinant clones isolated on selective medium are directly spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane that is successively exposed to solid repressive BMGY medium and inducible BMMY medium on agar plates. The membrane is further processed for in situ yeast cells lysis, and the resulting cell fractions adsorbed on the nitrocellulose are directly analyzed via a standard anti-IMP immunodetection procedure.\nThis protocol is particularly well suited for the evaluation of 96 individual clones at once, which therefore allows skipping the second selection step on G418 containing plates (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0002]), thus further limiting the handling steps post-transformation.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0005])\nYPD medium (see recipe)\nG418 sulfate\nRecombinant clones on MD plate (from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0002])\nBMGY agar (see recipe)\nBMMY agar (see recipe)\nYeastern lysis buffer (see recipe)\nSterile 96-well microplate and lid (e.g., Falcon, cat. no. 353072)\nSterile toothpicks\n96-well microplate shaker\nMultichannel pipet\nLarge petri dishes, 14 cm diameter (e.g., Greiner Bio-one, cat. no. 639160)\n1.

    "Immunodetection analysis is an essential means to evaluate the actual synthesis and integrity of a recombinant protein. However, these methods do not inform on the proper folding and functionality of the protein, which is often an issue with IMPs that need to be properly translocated in biological membranes during their production to fulfill their function. As far as possible, activity assays are thus required to evaluate this aspect and to properly validate expression conditions. However, such assays are often not accessible for IMPs, in particular for transporters, channels or enzymes that require two separate compartments to exert their function, which is usually not applicable to membrane preparation samples. In the case of GPCRs and other liganded-IMPs, ligand-binding assays are valuable methods to determine the amounts of active receptors (Bmax) and their affinity (Kd) for specific ligands. This protocol assesses the ligand-binding parameters of the ADRA1A receptor toward a specific radiolabeled antagonist. In brief, membrane preparations are incubated in triplicate with a given concentration of radioactive ligands until equilibrium is reached. For nonspecific binding determination, similar incubations are performed in parallel in the presence of an excess of unlabeled specific ligand. Bound and free ligands are separated by rapid filtration on glass-fiber filters and the retained radioactivity is measured by liquid-scintillation counting. Saturation curves are obtained with increasing concentrations of radioligand, and data are analyzed by nonlinear regression with appropriate software (Prism from GraphPad Software or KaleidaGraph from Synergy Software). Detailed description of the theoretical aspects, benefits, and limitations of ligand binding assays can be found in more specific reviews (for instance, see Bylund & Toews, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0011]).\nMaterials\nMembrane preparation samples (from Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-prot-0004])\nIce-cold binding buffer (see recipe)\nIce-cold wash buffer (see recipe)\nFilter buffer (see recipe)\n[3H]-Prasozin (Perkin Elmer, cat. no.

Subtract the NS from the T values to determine specific binding values. Analyze the data by nonlinear regression using appropriate software.\nFigure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-fig-0004] depicts a ligand-binding saturation curve obtained with Prism7 (GraphPad) using membranes of a P. pastoris clone expressing the ADRA1A receptor.\nWhen the ligand binding assay is properly set up, NS binding should be 10% to 20% of the T values. If the NS binding is elevated and makes up more than half of the T binding, the assay needs to be refined (see useful troubleshooting guides in Bylund, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.936#cpz1936-bib-0010]). If the T binding remains low and close to the NS values whatever the radioligand concentration, this signifies a low specific binding representative of an expressed receptor with poor activity. In this case, several parameters can be adjusted for an optimal expression, such as the duration and the temperature of the induction phase, as well as the medium formulation including the methanol concentration and the use of additive compounds. These different aspects are addressed and illustrated in the Commentary section.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d3fad444-a0b1-4df7-ad84-cb6a0fc4125d/cpz1936-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nRadioligand binding saturation curves obtained from membrane samples of P. pastoris expressing a FLAG-tagged human ADRA1A receptor. The specific binding curve (black circles) has been calculated by subtracting the non-specific (triangles) to the total (squares) binding values. The results shown are from three independent experiments. Data were fitted using the one-site saturation binding model."
