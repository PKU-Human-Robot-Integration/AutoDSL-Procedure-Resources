    "This protocol was approved by the institution's human research ethics committee, and written consent was obtained from the patient before the procedure.\n1. Preparation\nFor image acquisition, use ultrasound systems that include two-dimensional (2D), M-mode, and full Doppler capabilities, as well as simultaneous electrocardiographic tracing display ability.\nEnsure that multi-frequency probes, 5-6 MHz (for infants >2 kg) and 8-12 MHz (for infants <2 kg), are available for use in the appropriate size of infants. Commonly used echocardiographic terms are described in Table 1 with Supplementary File 1, depicting examples of probe placement and the corresponding representative echocardiographic views.\n\t​NOTE: The first echocardiography study includes a full morphologic and hemodynamic assessment of cardiac anatomy and physiology using a segmental approach as per the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines11.\n2. Preparing the patient for echocardiography evaluation\nFollow the institution's specific infection control precaution guidelines for the prevention of infection to the patients.\nUn-swaddle and expose the baby's chest and upper abdominal area, carefully move any leads that may be in the way and pay particular attention to skin integrity.\nMaintain the body temperature of the patient and the neutral thermal environment by the minimal opening of the incubator.\nEnsure continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring during the scan.\n3. Probe and image acquisition\nPlug in the echocardiography machine, attach the EKG cord and warm the ultrasound gel to 102 ˚F while waiting for the machine to boot up.\nEnsure a patient identifier such that the imaging is linked to the appropriate patient chart.\nChoose a probe appropriate for the patient size (a 6S-D cardiac sector ultrasound transducer for a patient ≥2 kg; a 12S-D cardiac sector ultrasound transducer for a patient <2 kg).\n\tNOTE: This protocol describes a case using a 12S-D transducer.\nAdjust the depth and brightness of the images.",
    "Click the image store after each step outlined below for the images to be saved.\n\tNOTE: A minimum of 3 cardiac cycles should be obtained.\n4. Image acquisition\nApical views\n\t\nStart with the apical four-chamber view. Place the probe on the apex with the position marker (notch) angling toward the left shoulder (see Supplementary File 1). Click 2D to start the first image. Click the up/down button on the interactive touch screen to orientate the apex of the heart at the bottom of the screen.\n\t\tNOTE: In infants with evolving chronic lung disease, this view is sometimes obtained more laterally and, on some occasions, more medially. The sector width may need to be widened to allow complete visualization of the bilateral ventricular walls by turning the width reset button clockwise.\nThe image acquired shows the four chambers of the heart. Once the optimal view is obtained, adjust the gain, depth, and grayscale to optimize the image quality. Adjust the depth by turning the depth knob on the console to reach a depth of 3.5 cm to complete the visualization of the atria and ventricles. Click the image store to save the 2D image.\nClick color on the console. Place the color box over the tricuspid valve using the trackball. Adjust the velocity reset to a color scale of 70-80 cm/s.\n\t\tNOTE: The blue regurgitant jet through the tricuspid valve during systole is evidence of tricuspid regurgitation.\nClick cursor, and then use the trackball to place the sample gate over the tricuspid valve. Click CW button to obtain the tricuspid regurgitant peak velocity. Click freeze > image store.\nClick 2D to reset the screen. Click color > simultaneous buttons to activate color Doppler. Use the trackball to place the color box over the pulmonary veins.",
    "Adjust the velocity and decrease the color Doppler to 50-60 cm/s. Click cursor, place the sample gate over the pulmonary vein and click PW to obtain the pulsed wave. To save, click freeze > image store.\n\t\tNOTE: A pulmonary venous flow velocity trace recorded by Doppler echocardiography is often described in three components, which are the systolic component (S), followed by the diastolic component (D), and there might be flow reversal during atrial contraction (A) in some cases.\nClick 2D to reset the image. Click cursor and place the sample gate at the tips of the open mitral valves. Click PW to obtain the mitral valve E/A. Click freeze > image store.\nClick 2D to reset the screen and then click color > simultaneous to activate the color Doppler. Increase the color box to cover just above the mitral valve to the apex. Perform the settings as in step 4.1.3. Click image store.\nRotate the probe clockwise to open and visualize the left ventricular outflow tract. Click cursor and place the sample gate at the mitral inflow and outflow junction, and then click PW to obtain the pulsed wave. Click freeze > image store to save the image.\nClick 2D to reset the image with an open left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Place the sample gate at the aortic valve and repeat step 4.1.9 for image capture.\n\t\tNOTE: When performing a measurement of the isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), it is optimal to decrease the sweep speed (25-50 mm/s) such that the interval between the end of systole and the beginning of diastole is seen.\nTo focus on the LVOT, turn the width button to narrow the sector width, place the sample gate over the aortic valve at the level of the hinge points, and repeat step 4.1.9.",
    "NOTE: It may be necessary to rotate clockwise and/or move toward the left hip to optimally align the LVOT; it is essential for accurate measurement of the left ventricular output that the line of insonation is parallel to the LVOT. Tracing the envelope is required for the calculation of the velocity time integral (VTI).\nTissue doppler imaging from Apical four-chamber view\n\t\nClick 2D to reset the image. Click image store to save the 2D image.\nClick the TVI button on the console to activate tissue Doppler imaging. Click image store to save the image apex to base.\nTurn the width button to narrow the sector width to interrogate the septum with a target frame rate of >200 frames/s (fps). Place the sample gate below the mitral valve annulus in the wall of the septum and repeat step 4.1.9.\n\t\tNOTE: This provides a tissue velocity curve from the valve annulus with positive velocity in systole and negative velocity in diastole. The peak velocity in systole is S', early diastole is E', and late diastole during atrial contraction is A'. For all the tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) myocardial velocities, ensure to align the cursor with the ventricular wall such that the velocity measured is the movement from the ventricular apex to the base of the ventricles.\nClick 2D on the interactive touch screen, click Tilt to move the sector to focus on the lateral wall of the left ventricle and maintain the frame rate at >200 fps. Place the sample gate over just below the mitral valve annulus in the wall and repeat step 4.1.9.\nMove the sector to focus on the lateral wall of the RV. Click 2D on the interactive touch screen. Click Tilt, place the sample gate in the lateral wall of the RV and repeat step 4.1.9.",
    "While still in tissue Doppler mode, click cursor and use the trackball to place the line of insonation at the tricuspid valve annulus, perpendicular to the free wall hinge point of the tricuspid valve. Click the M-mode button on the console for tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and repeat step 4.1.9. This is measured either with or without a TDI map.\nClick 2D on the console to reset the image. Transition to the apical two-chamber view by counterclockwise rotation of the probe (approximately 1 o'clock) and click image store for 2D images. Click TVI > image store to obtain TDI images.\nFor apical three-chamber LV view, turn the probe counterclockwise (approximately 11 o'clock) and click image store. Click TVI button > image store. Repeat step 4.1.9.\nTurn width button, narrow the sector to the anterior wall and repeat step 4.1.9.\nApical three-chamber RV view\n\tNOTE: The apical three-chamber RV view is obtained by placing the probe on the left sternal border in the fourth intercostal space with the notch pointing toward the left axilla. Movement along the sternal border may be necessary to adjust the image to show the RV inlet and outflow tracts.\n\t\nClick the 2D button to reset the image, turn the width button for complete visualization of the RV lateral wall, click image store to save the image, click color. Use the trackball to place the color box over the tricuspid valve. Place the sample gate over the tricuspid valve where the blue jet is observed and repeat step 4.1.4.\nUse the trackball to move the color box over the pulmonary artery. Click cursor and place the sample gate over the pulmonic valve. Click PW and CW to obtain the pulsed and continuous wave Doppler of the right ventricular outflow. Click freeze > image store.",
    "Parasternal long-axis view\n\tNOTE: For obtaining an optimal parasternal long-axis view , place the probe straight down on the third or fourth intercostal space just to the left of the sternum with the notch pointing toward the right shoulder. Ensure that the probe is rotated anticlockwise or clockwise to obtain the full length of the left ventricle, mitral valve, aortic valve, and right ventricle.\n\t\nClick 2D and the up/down tab on the interactive control to orient the right ventricle at the top of the screen. Click image store > cursor. Place the line of insonation through the left ventricle at the tips of the mitral valve leaflets, ensuring that the line is perpendicular to the interventricular septum and that the left ventricle is not foreshortened. Click M-mode > freeze > image store.\n\t\t​NOTE: The M-mode tracing shows the biphasic opening and closing of the mitral valve, as well as the dimensions of the interventricular septum, left ventricular cavity, and posterior walls of the right and left ventricles in both systole and diastole. This image is used to calculate the ejection fraction and fractional shortening29.\nClick 2D to reset the image. Turn the width button and focus on the aortic valve. Turn the depth knob to adjust the depth (2.5-3 cm) or turn the zoom button on the console to view the aortic annulus. Ensure that both leaflets are visualized such that the diameter is measurable.\nClick cursor and place the line of insonation through the aortic valve annulus and left atrium for left atrium and aortic dimensions (at the hinge points). Click M-mode > freeze > image store.\nClick 2D and angle the probe toward the left shoulder to focus on the pulmonary artery. Click color > simultaneous to obtain an image of the right ventricular outflow tract.",
    "Place the sample gate over the pulmonic valve at the hinge point and repeat step 4.1.9. Place the sample gate over the tricuspid valve and repeat step 4.1.4.\n\t\tNOTE: It may be necessary to move slightly toward the left shoulder to elongate the right ventricular cavity. As with the other views of the right ventricle, if there is tricuspid regurgitation, obtain a continuous wave Doppler to calculate the TR.\nParasternal short-axis view\n\tNOTE: Obtain the parasternal short-axis view by placing the probe in a sagittal position in the third or fourth intercostal space just to the left of the sternum with the notch pointing toward the left shoulder and with all three valves opening (aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves). Obtain a 2D image of the right ventricular inflow and outflow.\n\t\nActivate the color Doppler as in step 4.1.5. Perform the settings of step 4.1.3. Place the sample gate over the tricuspid valve where the blue jet is observed and repeat step 4.1.4. Place the sample gate over the pulmonic valve at the hinge points and repeat step 4.1.9.\nClick freeze to unfreeze the image. Click cursor and place the line of insonation over any regurgitant jet (red coloration) over the pulmonic valve. Click CW and repeat step 4.1.9.\nClick 2D to reset the image. Continue angling the probe toward the left flank until the fish-mouth appearance of the mitral valve is visualized. Place the line of insonation through the mitral valve at the level of the mitral valve leaflets and repeat step 4.4.3. This view is also used to calculate the ejection fraction and fractional shortening.",
    "Click 2D on the console and reset the image. Continue the 2D sweep (25-50 mm/s) toward the left flank at the apex of the left ventricle; obtain 2D images at the level of the papillary muscles (used to calculate the eccentricity index) and the apex. Click freeze > image store.\nHigh parasternal view\n\t​NOTE: With the infant's head turning toward the left shoulder, place the probe along the upper right border of the sternum with slight clockwise rotation from the sagittal plane and with the marker pointing toward the head.\n\t\nActivate the color Doppler as in step 4.1.5. Perform the settings of step 4.1.3. Click image store to acquire simultaneous 2D and color images while ensuring that the three proximal branches of the aorta are visible.\nPlace the sample gate at the preductal aortic arch, ensuring the line of insonation is parallel to the flow, and then at the postductal arch below the level of the ductus, ensuring the line of insonation is parallel to the flow, and repeat step 4.1.9.\nTo obtain the ductal view with a color sweep of PDA, click freeze button twice. Move the probe in an angling motion from the aortic arch toward the pulmonary artery by angling the probe toward the right flank. Click freeze > select all > image store.\nIn the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), click cursor, place the sample volume at the narrowest point of the PDA, and repeat step 4.1.9.\nBranch pulmonary artery view",
    "NOTE: This view is obtained by placing the probe along the upper 2/3 to the left of the sternum at a 3 o'clock position. The probe marker is directed to the left of the patient. It may be necessary to move toward the head to navigate poor acoustic windows, particularly for patients with apical lung overdistension, such as with chronic ventilation.\n\t\nAngle the probe toward the patient's head to reveal the branch pulmonary arteries with the same setting of the screen as the aortic arch view. Place the sample volume through the right pulmonary artery (RPA), ensuring the line of insonation is parallel to the flow, and repeat step 4.1.9. If the peak systolic velocity is >1.5 m/s, repeat 4.1.4.\n\t\tNOTE: This is performed to evaluate for peripheral pulmonic stenosis (PPS).\nRepeat the same steps on the left pulmonary artery (LPA).\nPulmonary vein view: crab view\n\tNOTE: This view is obtained by placing the probe in the suprasternal notch, perpendicular to the sagittal plane. With the marker pointing toward the left of the patient, angle the probe toward the patient's head to reveal the pulmonary veins.\n\t\nTurn the width button clockwise to increase the sector width, then, turn the velocity knob counterclockwise to adjust the color Doppler gain to 30-50 cm/s, click image store to obtain the image. Interrogate each pulmonary vein with color flow Doppler, place the sample gate on the pulmonary vein, and repeat step 4.1.9. Repeat this step until all the pulmonary veins are interrogated.\nSubcostal view",
    "NOTE: The subcostal view is obtained by placing the probe at the epigastrium area of the abdomen. With the probe marker pointing to the left of the infant, angle the probe toward the patient's abdomen. Once visualization of both the right atrium and the left atrium is obtained, ensure that at least 1/3 of the image is of the liver for the optimization of this view.\n\t\nClick 2D > up/down on the interactive screen. Ensure that the right atrium is oriented at the bottom part of the screen. Turn the width button. Click color > simultaneous. Turn the velocity knob to adjust the color gain to 40-50 cm/s. If the foramen ovale is patent, place the sample gate at the defect and repeat step 4.1.9.\nTo visualize the superior vena cava (SVC), turn the probe by clockwise rotation. Click cursor and place the sample volume approximately 1 cm within the SVC, ensuring the line of insonation is parallel to the flow. Click freeze > image store.\nClick up/down on the interactive screen to reorientate the screen so that the heart is positioned on the right side of the screen. Position the probe in the sagittal plane with the notch pointing toward the head of the patient. Angle the probe tilting toward the left of the patient to visualize the IVC and the hepatic vein. Place the sample gate at the hepatic vein and repeat step 4.1.9.",
    "To view the position of an umbilical vein catheter (UVC) or lower limb peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), slide the probe up toward the middle of the chest until the catheter is visualized in the image sector. A sweep from the right or left or rotation counterclockwise is necessary to view the course of the catheter. Click image store to obtain the image once the appropriate view of the central catheter has been visualized.\nTransition to the sagittal view of the abdominal aorta by sliding the probe toward the umbilicus in the sub-xiphoid area with the notch pointing toward the head. Adjust the color gain to 70-80 cm/s. Place the sample gate over the celiac artery and repeat step 4.1.9. Repeat the same steps for the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).\nSubscription Required.
