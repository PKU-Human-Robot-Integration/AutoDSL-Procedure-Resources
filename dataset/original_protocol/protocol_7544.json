    "Notes:  The pST1374-NLS-flag-linker-Cas9 plasmid is only a suggested plasmid, which can be replaced by other suitable plasmids. The principle of plasmid selection: (1) choose a small-molecular-weight plasmid, so that the plasmid is more stable and with a higher copy number; (2) choose a relaxation control plasmid, so that the plasmid can replicate autonomously; (3) choose a plasmid with multiple restriction enzyme cut points; (4) choose a plasmid with easy-to-detect markers, such as resistance markers; and (5) choose a plasmid expressed in E. coli. The above plasmids are synthesized by GENEWIZ, Suzhou, China (https://www.genewiz.com.cn/[href=https://www.genewiz.com.cn/]).Plasmid transformation and bacterial culture (timing: 3 days) Place a centrifuge tube (1.5 mL) containing 100 μL of competent cells [E. coli BL21 (DE3)] in an ice bath until completely thawed.Notes:  Store the competent cells [E. coli BL21 (DE3)] at -80 °C. Avoid freezing and thawing to ensure the activity of the competent cells. After thawing the competent cells, DNA should be quickly added. Add 1 ng of pACYC-ClyA-L7AE plasmid into the competent cells. Mix gently and let stand in an ice bath for 30 min.Place the centrifuge tube for 60–90 s in a 42 °C water bath. Transfer the centrifuge tube quickly to an ice bath for 2–3 min to cool the cells.Note: Do not shake the centrifugal tube during this process. Add 900 μL of liquid LB medium to the centrifuge tube. Incubate for 45–60 min at 37 °C in a shaker at 150 rpm.Notes:  The resistance gene has not yet been expressed during this process, so the liquid LB medium must be antibiotic-free. Growth for 1 h at 37 °C has the best effect on cell recovery and antibiotic resistance expression. Add 100 μL of transformed cells to a culture plate (10 cm) with solid LB medium containing 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol.",
    "Spread the cells gently with a sterile glass stick.Note: Prepare the culture plate (10 cm) with the solid LB medium containing 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol in advance. Place the culture plate at room temperature until the liquid is absorbed. Invert the culture plate and culture for 12–16 h at 37 °C. The culture plate should be sealed with sterile sealing film (Troubleshooting 1).Note: The number of bacteria can be adjusted on the plate, ideally to obtain several dozens of colonies on a plate (10 cm). Pause point:  Store the bacteria on the plate for one month at 4 °C.Carefully pick one bacterial colony on the plate. Add it into 3 mL of liquid LB medium containing 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol in a centrifuge tube (15 mL). Incubate for 10–12 h at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm.Note: To ensure oxygen supply for bacterial growth, seal the centrifuge tube using the sterile breathable sealing film. Add 3 mL of bacterial culture medium from step B7 into 300 mL of liquid LB medium containing 50 μg/mL chloramphenicol in a conical flask (500 mL). Incubate at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm. A spectrophotometer is used to monitor the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the bacterial culture medium. Add 0.1 mM IPTG to the medium when the OD600 reaches 0.6. Incubate for another 16 h at 16 °C with shaking at 180 rpm.Note: The IPTG-induced expression can be performed for 2 h at 37 °C, but the expression efficiency is not as good as induction at 16 °C. OMV-L7Ae extraction (timing: 10 h) Divide the 300 mL bacterial medium into six centrifuge tubes (50 mL). After centrifugation at 7,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C, collect the supernatant.Notes:  Balance the weight of the centrifugal tubes (50 mL).",
    "Dispose as soon as possible after centrifugation to prevent bacteria from spreading into the supernatant. Filter the 300 mL supernatant through a filter (0.45 μm). Through centrifugation at 3,000× g for 5–10 min at 4 °C, concentrate the filtering medium to 100 mL using an ultrafiltration tube (100 kDa).Filter the concentrated solution through a filter (0.22 μm).Put the filtering medium into two ultracentrifugation tubes.Note: Clean and dry the ultracentrifugation tubes in advance. Separate the OMV-L7Ae through ultracentrifugation at 150,000× g for 3 h at 4 °C.Notes:  Balance the weight of the ultracentrifugation tubes; the weight error of all ultracentrifugation tubes is less than 50 mg. Tighten the ultracentrifugation tube cover. Discard the supernatant. To fill up the ultracentrifugation tubes, resuspend the deposited OMV-L7Ae at the bottom of the tubes using DEPC-treated PBS. Repeat the ultracentrifugation at 150,000× g for 3 h at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the deposited OMV-L7Ae with the 200 μL of reaction buffer for mRNA binding in each tube (Troubleshooting 2).Note: After ultracentrifugation, discard the supernatant as soon as possible to prevent the OMV-L7Ae from redissolving in the supernatant. Pause point:  Store the OMV-L7Ae for one week at -80 °C.BoxC/D-mRNA synthesis (timing: 1 day) Notes:  The following method is a reference to protocols from NEB’s official website (https://www.neb.com/). Before the experiment, the table should be wiped with DEPC-water to avoid RNase contamination. Please wear gloves during the entire process.

Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.BoxC/D-mRNA purification:To the 50 μL poly(A) tailing product, add 25 μL of LiCl solution and mix well.Incubate for 30 min at -20 °C.Centrifuge at 20,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the boxC/D-mRNA.Remove the supernatant carefully. Rinse the pellet by adding 500 μL of cold 70% ethanol.Note: 70% ethanol should be pre-cooled to -20 °C in advance. Centrifuge at 20,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Remove the ethanol carefully. Spin the tube briefly to bring down any liquid on the wall. Remove residual liquid carefully using a sharp tip (e.g., loading tip).Note: The residual liquid should be removed to prevent organic solvents from affecting subsequent experiments. Air dry the pellet and resuspend the boxC/D-mRNA in 50 μL of DEPC-treated water.Heat the boxC/D-mRNA for 5 min at 65 °C to completely dissolve the boxC/D-mRNA. Mix well.Determine the boxC/D-mRNA concentration using NanoDrop. Generally, the boxC/D-mRNA concentration is approximately 500 ng/μL. The mRNA from plasmid pST1374-EGFP-boxC/D is named EGFP-boxC/D mRNA and the mRNA from plasmid pST1374-sec-OVA-3HA-MITD-boxC/D is named OVA-boxC/D mRNA (Troubleshooting 4).Note: The 260/280 of mRNA is between 1.8 and 2.0; 260/230 ≥ 2 indicates that the prepared mRNA is qualified. Pause point:  Store the boxC/D-mRNA for one month at -20 or -80 °C.Assembly and delivery of boxC/D-mRNA by OMV-L7Ae (timing: 11 days) Assembly of boxC/D-mRNA and OMV-L7Ae:Mix 9 μg of OMV-L7Ae (total protein weight) from step C7 and 1 μg of boxC/D-mRNA (EGFP-boxC/D or OVA-boxC/D) from step D3i and then put the mixture (OMV-L-mRNA) for 5 min at room temperature.Notes:  OMV-L7Ae and boxC/D-mRNA should be mixed immediately before delivery.",
    "OMV-L7Ae vesicles should be free of bacterial contamination. Delivery and evaluation of EGFP-boxC/D mRNA by OMV-L7Ae:Before transfection experiments of 18–24 h, add HEK-293T cells to a 24-well plate at a density of 40,000 cells per well with 500 μL of DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin G, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The cells are grown at 37 °C in the cell incubator with 5% CO2.Supplement the OMV-L-mRNA mixture (EGFP-boxC/D mRNA) from step E1 with 500 μL of DMEM medium.Carefully discard the cell supernatant of the 24-well plate.Note: The cell density is approximately 80% when transfection experiments are performed. Add 500 μL of OMV-L-mRNA mixture from step E2b to the HEK-293T cells in the 24-well plate.Culture cells for 6–8 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.Carefully discard the cell supernatant of 24-well plate. Add 500 μL of DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin G, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin to the 24-well plate.At 24 h after transfection, digest the cells with 100 μL of trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) for 30 s. Add 300 μL of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin G, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin to stop digestion.Through centrifugation at 800× g for 5 min at 4 °C, collect the HEK-293T cells.Discard the supernatant and then resuspend the HEK-293T cells with 200 μL of PBS. Perform the flow cytometry evaluation within 1 h and analyze the cells expressing EGFP (Troubleshooting 5).Note: HEK-293T cells are fragile and should be handled gently. Immune stimulation evaluation of OMV-based nanovaccines in vitro through delivery of OVA-boxC/D mRNA by OMV-L7Ae:Keep the C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) with a 12 h light/dark cycle and a humidity of 30%–70% at 20–22 °C in a room. Provide food and water ad libitum.",
    "After killing the C57BL/6 mice by cervical dislocation, dissect the mice and obtain the femurs and tibias. Use scissors and tweezers to remove as much muscle tissue as possible around the bones.Notes:  i. The femur has more bone marrow than the tibia. ii. Do not destroy the bones to avoid pollution. Soak the bones in a sterile culture plate containing 70% alcohol for 3 min to disinfect and sterilize and then wash twice with sterile PBS.Flush repeatedly the bone marrow cells with an injection syringe containing RPMI 1640 medium, 100 U/mL penicillin G, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 2% FBS until the bones are completely white.Note: The femurs and tibias of one mouse are cultured using approximately 40 mL of medium. Through centrifugation at 800× g for 5 min at 4 °C, collect the bone marrow cells.Discard the supernatant. To lysis the red blood cells, resuspend the cells with 1 mL of ACK lysis buffer. Incubate for 90 s at room temperature.Stop the lysis. Add 3 mL of PBS and then filter the cells through a cell strainer (70 μm).Through centrifugation at 800× g for 5 min at 4 , collect the cells.Discard the supernatant. Resuspend the precipitated cells with 12 mL of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin G, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 1% HEPES, 0.05 mM β-ME, 20 ng/mL IL-4, and 20 ng/mL GM-CSF, and then divide into six wells in a 6-well plate.Notes:  i. During steps E3a–E3i, make sure all reagents and samples are placed on an ice bath, as this has a positive effect on cell activity. ii. To maintain a sterile state, perform all steps on a clean bench using sterile containers. Culture the cells for six days at 37 °C in the cell incubator with 5% CO2.Notes:  i.",
    "Replace half of the medium every 2–3 days. ii. Remove and add medium gently to avoid interfering with cell growth. Collect non-adherent cells on day 6 through centrifugation at 800× g for 5 min at 4 , which are known as BMDCs.Discard the supernatant and then resuspend the precipitated BMDCs with 10 mL of RPMI 1640 medium.Quantify the cell density using the automated cell counter. Place 100,000 BMDCs into a centrifuge tube (1.5 mL) with 500 μL of RPMI 1640 medium.Add OMV-L-mRNA mixture (OVA-boxC/D mRNA) from step E1 to the BMDCs in the centrifuge tube (1.5 mL).Culture cells for 6–8 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.Centrifuge at 800× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Carefully discard the cell supernatant. Add 500 μL of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin G, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin to the centrifuge tube (1.5 mL).At 12 or 24 h after transfection, collect the stimulated BMDCs through centrifugation at 800× g for 5 min at 4 .Note: Seal the centrifuge tube (1.5 mL) with sealing film but preserve the air hole to ensure oxygen supply. Discard the supernatant and then resuspend the precipitated BMDCs with 200 μL of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS.Add the proper antibodies to analyze the maturation and cross-presentation of BMDCs. For the maturation assay, stain the BMDCs with FITC-anti-mouse CD11c (1:200, 1 μL), APC-anti-mouse CD80 (1:200, 1 μL), or PE/Cy7-anti-mouse CD86 (1:200, 1 μL). For the cross-presentation assay, stain the BMDCs with FITC-anti-mouse CD11c (1:200, 1 μL) and APC-anti-mouse H-2Kb bound to SIINFEKL (MHCI-OVA) (1:80, 2.5 μL).",
    "Stain the BMDCs under dark conditions for 30 min at 4 °C and then add 500 μL of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin G, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin to stop staining and wash cells.Through centrifugation at 800× g for 5 min at 4 , collect the stained BMDCs. Discard the supernatant and then resuspend cells with 200 μL of PBS.Perform the flow cytometry evaluation according to the manufacturer’s protocols within 1 h.Note: Using the CD80 or CD86 as the maturation marker, the CD80+ or CD86+ cells are gated in the CD11c+ cells. For the cross-presentation assay, the CD11c+MHCI-OVA+ cells are gated in the BMDCs. Expected outcomes The flow cytometry results show that the OMV-L-mRNA (EGFP-boxC/D) successfully delivered the EGFP-boxC/D mRNA into HEK-293T cells, resulting in EGFP expression in 29.4% of cells (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1).In the immune stimulation evaluation in BMDCs in step E3, the OMV-L-mRNA (OVA-boxC/D) induced notable maturation and antigen presentation, indicated by the upregulation of the surface expression of CD80, CD86, and MHCI-OVA (Figure 2A–2C, Supplementary Figures 2–3). These data demonstrated that the OMV-based nanocarriers can efficiently deliver mRNA antigens into BMDCs and induce antigen presentation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4774/bioprotoc-13-13-4774-g001.jpgFigure 1.

One-way ANOVA and a Tukey’s multiple comparisons test were used for statistical analysis. ****, p < 0.0001. Figure adapted with permission from Li et al. (2022).Limitations This study preliminarily demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of OMVs as tumor vaccine carriers for mRNA delivery. However, compared with the LNPs-based delivery platform, the efficiency of the OMV-based delivery platform is lower, which needs to be solved urgently in the subsequent clinical transformation process. We can make efforts in the following two aspects: 1) optimize the structure of the archaeal RNA-binding protein L7Ae and the matched binding sequence boxC/D, and 2) more boxC/D sequences can be connected in series to ensure greater binding and delivery efficiency.In addition, as the bacteria-derived nanobiomaterials, the sterile production of the OMVs requires special attention in future clinical applications. In the procedure for the OMV-based nanocarriers, the bacteria were first centrifuged at 7,000× g for 15 min and almost all the bacteria were precipitated and removed. The OMVs from the supernatant were then filtered twice in 0.45 and 0.22 μm filters to ensure that the final OMVs did not contain bacteria. However, in future clinical applications, radiation sterilization of the final nanocarriers system can be performed to further ensure that the OMV nanocarriers are sterile."
