    "Design phase A1. sgRNA/Cas9 design and synthesis sgRNA target selectionAccess the “ZebrafishGenomics” (Varshney et al., 2016) and/or “CRISPRscan” (Moreno-Mateos et al., 2015) tracks on the UCSC Genome Browser (Figure 1).Select ~30 bp of sequence flanking each site of the intended integration site (~60 bp total sequence) to search for target sequences. Select 2–3 targets that generate the DSB as close to the integration site as possible and obtain their CRISPR target sequences (Figure 1).Note: See General notes for information about alternate sgRNA design. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4732/bioprotoc-13-15-4732-g001.jpgFigure 1. Screenshot of the UCSC Genome Browser with CRISPRscan and ZebrafishGenomics hubs enabled to identify sgRNA target sites. Use tracks (marked in yellow) to search for targets that can be synthesized with a T7 promoter (guide sequence begins with a “GG”) as close as possible to the intended nucleotide for point mutation or site of insertion. In this example, both CRISPRscan and ZebrafishGenomics predicted two overlapping targets (sgRNA-T1 and sgRNA-T2) close to the target nucleotide (marked in red box) and were selected for sgRNA synthesis.Add the T7 promoter sequence (TAATACGACTCACTATA) to the 5′ side of the target sequence (obtained from the genome browser) and the gRNA overlapping sequence (GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGC) to the 3′ side of the target sequence to obtain the final sequence of the top strand oligo. The oligo sequence for a 20 bp sgRNA will be as follows:5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAggn(18)GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGC-3′. Critical:  Do not include the PAM sequence in the oligo.Order the top strand oligos as standard desalted oligos and universal bottom strand oligo as an ultramer (see Reagents).Fluorescent PCR primer designDesign primers to amplify a 200–350 bp product surrounding the target region with the sgRNA binding sites approximately in the middle of the amplicon.",
    "Critical:  Target sequences should be a minimum of 25 bp from the ends of the amplicon to prevent NHEJ from removing any of the primer binding sequence. If possible, design primers to avoid repetitive sequences or stretches of the same nucleotide, as it is important that the PCR from a WT sample gives a single peak to avoid false positive data. A primer design software can also be used.Add the M13F sequence (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT -3′) to the 5′ side of the forward primer and a PIG-tail sequence (5′-GTGTCTT-3′) to the 5′ side of the reverse primer. Tailed primers will be as follows:Forward: 5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT (n)18–22 -3′Reverse: 5′-GTGTCTT (n)18–22 -3′Order tailed primers and the M13-FAM primer (see Reagents) as standard desalted primers. Critical:  It is recommended that each primer set be run with a minimum of eight WT DNA samples to ensure the amplicon produces a single peak (see section A3 for PCR setup).sgRNA synthesisSet up the oligo annealing reactions as follows:5× Phusion buffer 10 μLAdvantage UltraPure PCR dNTP mix (10 mM each) 1 μLTop-strand oligo (10 μM) 1 μLBottom strand ultramer (10 μM) 1 μLPhusion high fidelity DNA polymerase 0.5 μLUltrapure water 36.5 μLTotal 50 μLAnneal and extend the oligos in a thermocycler using the following conditions:98 °C, 2 min50 °C, 10 min72 °C, 10 min4 °C, holdRun 4 μL of the assembled oligo reaction along with a 50 bp DNA ladder on a 2.5% (w/v) agarose gel using standard conditions. A single band is expected at 120 bp (Figure 2).Following gel validation, set up the sgRNA synthesis reaction using the HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis kit as follows:NTP buffer mix 5 μLAssembled oligo 4 μLT7 RNA polymerase 1 μLTotal 10 μLIncubate the reaction for 4 h at 37 °C followed by a 4 °C hold.",

A band between 100 and 200 bp is expected (Figure 2). Occasionally, a slightly larger band is also seen due to secondary structure. Dilute the remaining sgRNA to a final concentration between 100 and 300 ng/μL with an A260/280 ratio of 2.0–2.3. Pause point:  sgRNA can be stored at -80 °C for several months.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4732/bioprotoc-13-15-4732-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Resuspend the RNA pellet with 20 μL of ultrapure water.Quantify the mRNA using a NanoDrop. The concentration should be > 500 ng/μL with an A260/280 ratio of 2.0–2.3.Run ~500 ng on an 1% (w/v) agarose gel to confirm quality using standard protocols. The expected band will run at ~1.6 kb.Aliquot the Cas9 mRNA into 5 μL aliquots with a concentration of 500–1,000 ng/μL. Pause point:  Cas9 aliquots can be stored at -80 °C for months. Multiple freeze-thaw cycles are not recommended.A2. Injections of sgRNA/Cas9 mRNA for evaluation of sgRNA activity Prepare injection apparatus and pull needles.Prepare an injection mixture for each sgRNA from section A1, step 3 with SpCas9 mRNA from section A1, step 4 as follows:sgRNA (354 ng) variable volumeCas9 mRNA (2.1 μg) variable volumeUltrapure water up to 10 μLTotal 10 μLLoad the injection mixture into a capillary injection needle and inject 1.4 nL per embryo into ~100 embryos. Repeat this step for each injection mixture.Note: If a different volume is injected, adjust amounts of sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA in injection mixture such that each embryo receives 50 pg sgRNA and 300 pg Cas9 mRNA. Incubate the injected embryos as well as uninjected controls from the same clutch in a 28.5 °C incubator in egg water.",
    "Remove any unfertilized and injected damaged embryos at 3–6 h post fertilization (hpf).At 1 day post fertilization (dpf), remove any deformed and dead embryos.A3. Determine activity of each sgRNA using CRISPR-STAT At 1 dpf, collect and euthanize eight embryos from each injection group and uninjected WT as controls.Place one embryo per well in a 96-well plate. Each injection group will use one column on the plate. Critical:  If embryos are still in chorions, place the plate into a -20 or -80 °C freezer for 20–30 min to completely freeze and burst the chorion, allowing extraction reagents in following steps to access the tissue.Mix 25 μL of extraction solution and 7 μL of tissue preparation solution for each embryo (i.e., 10 samples: 250 μL extraction solution and 70 μL tissue preparation solution). Add 32 μL of the extraction/tissue preparation solution mixture to each sample. Critical:  Embryos should be submerged in the solution. Do not vortex.Incubate the plate at RT for 10 min followed by 5 min at 95 °C.Add 25 μL of neutralization solution B to each well and mix by vortexing. Pause point:  DNA can be stored at -20 °C for up to four weeks.Note: See General notes for information about alternate DNA extraction methods. Dilute the extracted DNA 1:10 with ultrapure water for use in PCR reactions.Add 30 μL of fluorescent PCR primer mix (see Recipes) to a 500 μL aliquot of fluorescent PCR master mix (see Recipes) and aliquot 10 μL/well of a new 96-well plate.Note: These volumes are for 48 samples and can be adjusted depending on the number of samples being processed. Add 3 μL of diluted DNA from section A3, step 6 to each well. Vortex the plate and spin down.",

Vortex the plate and spin down.Incubate plate at 95 °C for 5 min using a thermocycler.Load the plate into the 3730xl DNA analyzer and run using CRISPR-STAT settings.Analyze data using the GeneMapper Software package to determine sgRNA activity and select the best target (Figure 3).Note: Active sgRNAs show multiple peaks corresponding to the NHEJ-mediated indels. If all tested sgRNAs show good activity, choose the target that generates the DSB closest to the intended integration site. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4732/bioprotoc-13-15-4732-g003.jpgFigure 3. Examples of CRISPR-STAT plots showing sgRNA activity. In this example, both sgRNAs selected in Figure 1 are active. sgRNA-T1 would be selected as the best target and used in subsequent steps, as it generates the DSB closer to the intended nucleotide change. The x-axis shows the size of the peaks (bp), the y-axis shows fluorescent intensity, and the green arrow denotes the WT allele.A4. Design of HDR template and screening primers HDR template designNote: The design described below is for a sgRNA in the reverse orientation (CCN PAM site) with respect to the open reading frame (ORF). If the sgRNA is in the forward orientation (NGG PAM site), it is recommended to align the guide in the reverse compliment orientation and follow the steps below.",
    "Align the selected sgRNA target sequence to the reference sequence in the orientation that displays PAM as CCN.Determine the sequence of homology arms by identifying the site of DSB. Select 91 bp of the sequence on the left side of the DSB site for the left homology arm. Select 36 bp of sequence on the right side of the DSB site for the right homology arm.Note: For SpCas9, the DSB occurs 5 bp upstream of the PAM site [i.e., N18(DSB)NN NGG]. For insertion of DNA fragments: insert the desired sequence between these homology arms (Figure 4). Critical:  If the inserted sequence separates the sgRNA binding and PAM sites, modification of the PAM site is not required to prevent recutting after HDR (example in Figure 4A). Otherwise, make a silent change in the PAM site. If a silent change cannot be made to the PAM site, 3–4 silent changes in the sgRNA binding site are typically sufficient to disrupt binding and prevent recutting from the sgRNA (example in Figure 4B).Note: Depending on where the DSB occurs, it might be necessary to add additional sequences to maintain the ORF (example in Figure 4C). For point mutations: modify the desired nucleotide in the homology arm sequence. If the desired point mutation disrupts the PAM site and generates a restriction site, additional nucleotide changes are not required (example in Figure 5A). If the desired point mutation does not disrupt the PAM site, silent changes are required to either destroy the PAM site (example in Figure 5B) or sgRNA binding site (example in Figure 5C). Any combination of these bp changes (desired change, PAM site, and/or sgRNA binding site) will need to generate a new restriction site that can be used for screening.",
    "Critical:  It is important to generate a new restriction site instead of destroying a restriction site. Using loss of a restriction site for screening can lead to false positives, as this site can be destroyed by random indels instead of the integration of the DNA fragment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4732/bioprotoc-13-15-4732-g004.jpgFigure 4. Examples of HDR template design to knock-in desired DNA sequences. (A) The DNA insertion of an in-frame codon TTA occurs directly at the DSB (denoted by red arrowhead). This insertion disrupts the sgRNA binding site and no additional modifications are required. (B) The DNA insertions occur 5 bp upstream of the DSB (denoted by red arrowhead). The insertion does not disrupt the sgRNA binding or the PAM site and a silent change cannot be made to the PAM site. Therefore, several silent changes (shown in magenta) are required to prevent recutting after HDR repair. (C) The HA epitope tag is inserted at the 3′ end of a gene’s ORF. The DSB (denoted by red arrowhead) occurs 6 bp upstream of the stop codon (shown in red font). To maintain the gene’s ORF, these 6 bp (shown in blue font) are added into the HDR template with one of the nucleotides (shown in magenta font) changed to a silent change to modify PAM site and prevent recutting after HDR repair. A new stop codon (shown in purple font) is added after the HA tag to terminate translation. In all examples, the sgRNA is in bold and the PAM site is underlined.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4732/bioprotoc-13-15-4732-g005.jpgFigure 5. Examples of HDR template design to knock-in a point mutation. (A) The point mutation G>A (shown in blue font) modifies the PAM site as well as generates an AluI restriction site that can be used for screening.",
    "(B) The point mutation G>C (shown in blue font) is 17 bp downstream of the DSB site. A silent change is made to disrupt the PAM site (G>C, shown in magenta font) and this change also generates a SalI restriction site that can be used for screening. (C) The point mutation C>A (shown in blue font) is 6 bp upstream of the DSB site. In this example, a silent change cannot be made to the PAM site, and, therefore, four silent changes are required (shown in magenta font) to destroy the sgRNA binding site. One of these changes also generates a SfcI restriction site that can be used for screening. In all examples, the DSB site is denoted by a red arrowhead, sgRNA is shown in bold font, and the PAM site is underlined.Identify potential polymorphisms in the homology arms by fin clipping 24 male and 24 female adult fish followed by PCR and sequencing of the target region.Note: The previously designed primers may be used for this step, depending on their binding sites. Analyze the sequence data to identify any polymorphisms. If polymorphisms are identified, fish should be grouped into a cohort with 100% homology to the reference sequence used for design of HDR template. Alternately, modify the homology arms to match the sequence of your fish cohort.To obtain the final sequence of the HDR template, orient the sequence with the 91 bp homology arm on the 5′ side and the 36 bp homology arm on the 3′ side. Order templates smaller than 200 bp as an ultramer (IDT) and larger than 200 bp as a ssDNA fragment (Azenta Life Sciences).Note: Depending on the vendor used to synthesize the HDR template, the amount delivered varies widely.",
    "The HDR template should be resuspended in ultrapure water to a concentration that can be accurately pipetted to prepare the injection mix in section B3. Design of knock-in screening primersFor knock-in of DNA fragments: design primers that amplify the target region but do not overlap with the HDR template. The primers should amplify a region of up to 350 bp (including the insertion sequence). Add the M13F sequence (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) to the 5′ side of the forward primer and a PIG-tail sequence (5′-GTGTCTT-3′) to the 5′ side of the reverse primer (Figure 6).Note: The previously designed fluorescent PCR primers may be used for screening if they meet these criteria. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4732/bioprotoc-13-15-4732-g006.jpgFigure 6. Schematic showing design of screening primers for insertion of a DNA fragment. Primers should not overlap with the HDR template to allow for screening of precise integration. Homology arms (left HA and right HA) are marked in red in both genomic DNA and HDR template. Inserted sequence is marked in blue on the HDR template. M13F sequence is added to the forward primer and the PIG-tail sequence is added to the reverse primer.For point mutations: design primers that amplify the target region but do not overlap with the HDR template. The primers should amplify a region up to 350 bp. Add the M13F sequence (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) to the 5′ side of the forward primer and a PIG-tail sequence (5′-GTGTCTT plus restriction site sequence-3′) to the 5′ side of the reverse primer (Figure 7). Critical:  This screening strategy will not work if the same restriction site is also present between the new knock-in restriction site and the forward primer. The digested PCR fragment must be > 100 bp for the fluorescent signal to be detected.Note: The previously designed forward primer may be used for screening if it meets these criteria.",
    "The reverse primer will need to have the new restriction site added between the PIG-tail and binding sequence. A schematic of the fluorescent PCR digestion strategy can be found in Carrington et al. (2022) (Figure 3B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4732/bioprotoc-13-15-4732-g007.jpgFigure 7. Schematic showing design of screening primers for knock-in of a point mutation. Primers should not overlap with the HDR template (shown with homology arms in red, restriction enzyme recognition sequence in blue, and point mutation by black line) to allow for screening of precise integration. M13F sequence is added to the 5′ end of forward primer. PIG-tail and the restriction enzyme recognition sequences (RS) are added to the 5′ end of reverse primer.Somatic screening phase B1. Injections to deliver sgRNA/Cas9 and HDR template Prepare injection apparatus and pull needles.Prepare injection mixture for sgRNA/Cas9 as described in section A2, step 2.Prepare injection mixture for sgRNA/Cas9 plus HDR template as follows:sgRNA (354 ng) variable volumeCas9 mRNA (2.1 μg) variable volumeHDR template (175 ng) variable volumeUltrapure water up to 10 μLTotal 10 μLNote: These amounts are for injections of 1.4 nL per embryo. If a different volume is injected, adjust amounts of sgRNA, Cas9 mRNA, and HDR template in injection mixture such that each embryo receives 50 pg sgRNA, 300 pg Cas9 mRNA, and 25 pg of HDR template. Load the injection mixture into a capillary injection needle and inject 1.4 nL per embryo. Repeat this step for each injection mixture. Inject ~100 embryos for the sgRNA/Cas9 mixture and ~200 embryos for the sgRNA/Cas9 plus HDR template mixture.Incubate the injected embryos as well as uninjected controls in a 28.5 °C incubator in egg water. Remove any unfertilized and injected damaged embryos at 3–6 hpf.At 1 dpf, remove any deformed or dead embryos.B2.",
    "Evaluation of somatic knock-in using CRISPR-STAT At 1 dpf, collect 24 embryos from each injection group (sgRNA/Cas9 and sgRNA/Cas9 plus HDR template) and uninjected controls in a 96-well plate (one embryo per well). Keep the remaining embryos in the incubator to be raised after knock-in is confirmed. Critical:  If embryos are still in chorions, place the plate into a -20 or -80 °C freezer for 20–30 min to completely freeze and burst the chorion, allowing extraction reagents in following steps to access the tissue.Extract DNA, perform fluorescent PCR using primers designed for knock-in screening (section A4, step 2), and run samples as described in section A3. For DNA insertion projects, proceed to step 7 and skip digestion steps 3–6 that are used for point mutation screening.Note: Store extracted DNA at -20°C, as it will be needed for confirmation by TOPO cloning. Prepare digestion mixture as follows:Enzyme (200 U/μL) 15 μL10× digestion buffer 75 μLUltrapure water 660 μLTotal 750 μLNote: This is an example using SalI-HF that should be modified based on the enzyme that is appropriate for the designed HDR template. Add 5 μL of the digestion mixture to a new 96-well plate.Add 5 μL of the fluorescent PCR products to the plate containing the digestion mixture.Incubate with the following conditions using a thermocycler:37 °C, 1.5 h (digestion)60 °C, 20 min (heat inactivation of restriction enzyme)4 °C, holdCritical:  It is highly recommended that restriction digestion conditions are modified based on the restriction enzyme being used and optimized using WT samples before using injected samples. WT sample digestion is assessed by removal of the PIG-tail, resulting in a product that is 7–10 bp shorter than undigested PCR products (see Figure 8 panel B to compare undigested and digested samples to see the shift in WT peak size after digestion).",
    "Mix 3 μL of fluorescent PCR product (DNA insertion) or digested fluorescent PCR product (point mutation) with 10 μL of ROX-Hi-Di mixture and run plates on 3730xl DNA analyzer as described in section A3, steps 10–14.Analyze data using the GeneMapper Software package to determine the number of samples in each group that have peaks at the expected knock-in allele size (Figure 8).Note: For point mutations, it is important to confirm complete digestion in the uninjected WT samples, since incomplete digestion can result in false negatives. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4732/bioprotoc-13-15-4732-g008.jpgFigure 8. Examples of CRISPR-STAT plots from injected embryos to detect somatic knock-in. CRISPR-STAT plots from uninjected, sgRNA/Cas9-injected, and sgRNA/Cas9 plus HDR template–injected embryos are analyzed to determine if an enrichment of the peak corresponding to the knock-in allele size is seen in the presence of HDR template. The x-axis shows the size of the peaks (bp), the y-axis shows fluorescent intensity, and the red arrow denotes the expected knock-in allele. (A) Example of a DNA insertion with the knock-in peak being larger than the WT allele. (B) Example of a point mutation before and after digestion. The undigested samples serve as controls, with peak for WT allele at 7–10 bp larger than in the digested samples. The peak for knock-in allele should only be observed after digestion in sgRNA/Cas9 plus HDR template samples.Compare the number of samples with knock-in peaks for each treatment and determine if there is an enrichment of the desired knock-in peak in the sgRNA/Cas9 plus HDR template samples compared to the sgRNA/Cas9 alone. If an enrichment is not observed, repeat injections to rule out technical errors or design a new sgRNA/HDR template combination.B3. Somatic knock-in confirmation by TOPO cloning and sequencing Select 2–3 samples that are positive for the expected size peak from the sgRNA/Cas9 plus HDR template group.",

Pool these fish into a tank and use for screening (described below), as these fish are most likely to show germline transmission to their progeny. Founder fish that are negative for the knock-in peak in their fins should be kept separated until a positive germline transmitting fish is identified.C2. Screening prioritized founder fish by pooled embryos Set up pairwise crosses of each prioritized founder fish with a WT fish and collect embryos for screening.Incubate embryos at 28.5 °C overnight.At 1 dpf, collect three embryos per well (up to 24 wells per founder depending upon the clutch size) in a 96-well plate.Note: This strategy allows for screening of 72 embryos per founder and four founders per plate. Extract DNA, perform fluorescent PCR, and run samples as described in section C1, steps 2–15. For point mutations, perform restriction digest steps described in section B2, steps 3–7 after fluorescent PCR.Analyze data using the GeneMapper software package to determine if any samples show the expected knock-in allele and identify the corresponding founder fish (Figure 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4732/bioprotoc-13-15-4732-g009.jpgFigure 9. Examples of fluorescent PCR plots from pooled embryo screening to identify germline transmitting founders. Each embryo has a WT allele from the WT parent and an unknown allele (could be WT, indel, or knock-in) from the founder fish.",
    "Thus, a robust WT peak (denoted by green arrow) is detected in all pools with up to three additional peaks of unknown sizes. (A) Example of a positive pool with one embryo heterozygous for the knock-in allele (denoted by red arrow). Other peaks in this sample (denoted by the blue arrows) are random indels generated by NHEJ. (B) Example of a negative sample where all embryos are heterozygous for random indels (denoted by blue arrows). The x-axis shows the size of the peaks (bp), and the y-axis shows fluorescent intensity.C3. Confirmation by screening individual embryos At 1–5 dpf, collect 48 embryos (one embryo per well) in a 96-well plate from founders positive for germline transmission of knock-in peak in pooled embryo screening. This may require crossing the fish again and collecting a new clutch of embryos.Extract DNA, perform fluorescent PCR, and run samples as described in section C1, steps 2–15. For point mutations, also perform restriction digest as described in section B2, steps 3–7.Analyze data using the GeneMapper Software package to determine if any samples have the expected knock-in allele.Note: Positive knock-in plots will have two peaks that represent the WT and knock-in allele. Examples can be seen in Carrington et al. (2022) in Figures 4, S2, and S5. Verify precise knock-in by Sanger sequencing of positive samples and aligning reads to a reference knock-in DNA fragment.C3. Establish stable lines Outcross germline transmitting founders with WT fish and grow progeny to adulthood.Fin clip F1 fish as adults and extract DNA, perform fluorescent PCR, and run samples as described in section C1, steps 2–15. For point mutations, also perform restriction digest as described in section B2, steps 3–7.Analyze data in GeneMapper software and determine samples with the knock-in allele.",
    "Verify precise knock-in by Sanger sequencing and aligning reads to a reference knock-in DNA fragment.Note: It is recommended that all F1 fish are sequence confirmed to ensure all fish have precise knock-in at both ends. F1 fish can be incrossed for subsequent experiments or phenotyping."
