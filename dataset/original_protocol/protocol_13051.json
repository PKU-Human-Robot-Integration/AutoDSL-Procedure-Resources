    "1. Sample preparation\nClone the sequence of interest into the vector containing the Lambda DNA fragments, which serve as the handle sequences (Figure 2)43,50.\nFirst generate a DNA template for subsequent in vitro transcription via PCR (Figure 2B; reaction 1). At this PCR step, the T7 promoter is added in the 5' end of the sense DNA molecule32,33,43,50. Set the PCR reaction according to Table 1. Run the PCR in 50 µL aliquots with appropriate cycles in the thermocycler.\nPrepare the handles by two separate PCR reactions (Table 1, Figure 2B; reaction 2 and 3). First, generate the 5' handle by PCR. Then, generate the 3' handle and simultaneously label it with digoxigenin by using a 5' digoxigenin-labeled primer32,33,43,50.\nAfter the PCR, purify the DNA using silica spin columns.\nCarry out the in vitro transcription reaction using T7 RNA polymerase (Table 2)32,33,43,50. Incubate the reaction at 37 °C for 2-4 h depending on the length of the RNA. Next, add DNase I to the reaction and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min to digest the DNA template. Purify the RNA using silica spin columns.\nDuring the labeling reaction of the 5' handle (Table 3), add biotin-16-dUTP at the 3' end of the handle by T4 DNA polymerase38,50. Perform the reaction at room temperature for 1-2 h. Afterwards, purify the DNA using silica spin columns.\n\tNOTE: Since the 5' handle must be labeled at its 3' end (Figure 2B), the labeling cannot be performed during the PCR.",
    "Mix the components mentioned above - 5' handle (3' labeled with biotin), 3' handle (5' labeled with digoxigenin), and RNA - in a 1:1:1 molar ratio in annealing buffer (80% formamide, 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8), to obtain the desired RNA/DNA hybrid (Table 4). Heat the annealing mixture up to 85 °C for 10 min and then slowly cool down to 4 °C.\nMix the annealed sample with 1/10 of volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5), 3 volumes of ice-cold ethanol and incubate at -80 °C for at least 1 h or at -20 °C overnight.\nCentrifuge the samples at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and dry the pellet (usually not visible) under vacuum.\nFinally, resuspend, the pellet in 50 µL of RNase-free water and make aliquots. Store the aliquots at -80 °C until used. For short term storage, the samples can be also stored at -20 °C.\n2. Instrument setup\nNOTE: The following protocol is optimized for the commercial optical tweezers instrument C-Trap from LUMICKS company. Therefore, adjustments to the presented steps might be necessary while using other optical tweezers instruments. If not used, the microfluidics system of the machine is kept in bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution) and must be washed before use.\nDiscard the bleach and fill the syringes with 1 mL of RNase-free water.\nAdd 50 µL of 0.5 M sodium thiosulfate to at least 1 mL of the RNase-free water and thoroughly wash the system (1 bar, at least 0.5 mL) to eliminate the remaining bleach in the system.\nDiscard the sodium thiosulfate solution from the syringes. Replace syringes with fresh ones and wash the system with at least 0.5 mL of RNase-free water.",
    "NOTE: Be careful, that the microfluidics system never runs dry to avoid air bubbles in the system.\nPut 2 drops of immersion oil (refractive index of 1.33) or approximately 70 µL of water on top of the objective.\nPlace the flow cell inside the holding frame in its position.\nPut 2 drops of immersion oil (refractive index of 1.51) on top of the flow cell.\nTurn on the laser device in the tweezers machine. Once it is running, turn on the trapping laser in the software interface at 100%.\nUsing diagnostic cameras (Z-finder), adjust the Z-axis to the middle of the chamber between the second and the third reflections (interfaces) where the refraction rings are the biggest, by turning the micro screw.\n\tNOTE: Each time the objective is moved closer to the measuring chamber and the focal plane of the objective crosses the interface between two phases, a reflection can be recognized in the Z-finder mode. There are 4 interfaces possible: (i) water/immersion oil and bottom glass (ii) bottom glass and buffer inside the chamber (iii) buffer inside the chamber and top glass (iv) top glass and immersion oil for condenser.\nAdjust the condenser position (set trapping laser to approximately 50%) so the condenser touches the immersion oil on top of the measuring chamber.\nAdjust the focus by moving slowly down/up with the condenser, so approx. 10 light bands are shown in the moon mode (diagnostic cameras).\n3. Sample measurement",
    "Incubate anti-digoxigenin-coated beads (AD) with the sample constructs (3 µL of 0.1% (w/v) AD bead suspension + 4 µL of sample) and with 1 µL of RNase inhibitors and 8 µL of the assay buffer (300 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.05% Tween 20, 5 mM DTT) at RT for 10-20 min. After the incubation, dilute the sample in 500 µL of assay buffer.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to add oxygen scavengers, particularly during fluorescence measurements to the buffer in order to prevent oxidative damage. Here oxygen scavenger system containing glucose (8.3 mg/mL), glucose oxidase (40 U/mL) and catalase (185 U/mL) was used.\nMix 0.8 µL of 1% (w/v) streptavidin-coated (SA) beads with 1 mL of assay buffer.\nDiscard water from the syringes and fill the syringes with respective suspensions/solutions. Wash for at least 2 min at approximately 1 bar, and then start catching beads.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the experimental set-up, different channel arrangements may be used (Figure 3). Typically, one flow channel is filled with anti-digoxigenin beads carrying the RNA molecule. A second channel is filled with the streptavidin-coated beads. Buffer channel is used to form the tethers. A fourth channel can be employed to load the RNA binding protein (Figure 3C), or alternatively RBP can be added directly in the buffer channel (Figure 3B).\nTo capture the beads, move the optical traps apart from each other. First move to the AD channel and catch an AD-bead in trap 1. Next, move the stage to the SA-channel and catch a single SA bead by trap 2.\n\tNOTE: Try to stay at the interface of the buffer and bead channels to avoid losing the already caught bead, or to prevent catching multiple beads by the same trap.",
    "Once the beads of the right size are captured, move to the buffer channel and stop the laminar flow. Next, perform force calibration to check trap stiffness. The respective stiffness values should not differ in the x/y axis by more than 10-15%.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the laser power or the laser split between the traps according to bead size. Force calibration does not have to be done for every bead pair as long as the bead templates match (similarity score > 0.9). However, it should be performed regularly, or at least every time assay conditions are changed.\nStart fishing for a tether by moving the beads close to each other, waiting for a few seconds, and then moving them back apart, repeat until a tether is formed. A tether formation results in an increase of measured force upon pulling the two beads away from each other.\n\tNOTE: To avoid formation of multiple tethers, the beads should not be moved too close. Upon catching a tether between the two beads, tether quality can be checked by finding the overstretching plateau. The plateau should be between 50 to 60 pN for a single tether.\nUpon obtaining a tether, start the measurement. Depending on the phenomenon studied different measurement setups should be chosen (Figure 1B-D).\n\tNOTE: Usually at the beginning of the experiment, a force-ramp experiment is conducted to check the tether quality and probe the behavior. Afterward, one may also start the constant-force or constant-position experiments to study the state transitions further. Once sufficient number of measurements have been performed on an RNA sample to determine its behavior, labeled factors can be added to the system to perform confocal measurements.\nTo perform fluorescence measurements, turn on the confocal lasers and photon counter unit in the optical tweezers instrument.",
    "Turn on the excitation laser of desired wavelength in the software interface and set the power of the laser to 5% or higher, depending on the fluorophore.\n\tNOTE: While not measuring lower the power setting of the excitation laser to 0% to avoid excessive photodamage to the sample.\nStart imaging the sample by using image functions of the software.\n\tNOTE: In order to get well-focused images, the focal plane of the confocal microscope and optical traps have to be aligned. For this purpose, autofluorescence of the polystyrene beads in the blue laser channel can be employed. The focal plane of optical traps is moved up or down in the z-axis until the image of beads reaches its highest diameter. At this position, the fluorescence signal from the molecule tethered between the beads can be measured.\nTo use the kymograph function, specify the x-y position of the kymograph axis so that it allows detection of the tether between the beads.\nThroughout the measurement, buffer composition can be easily changed by either moving the beads to different channels or by changing the buffer supplied in the microfluidics system.\n4. Data analysis\nRaw data pre-processing\n\t\nBy using a simple script, downsample the raw data enough to (i) allow faster subsequent data processing but (ii) still contain all the critical information (Figure 4A). Usually, 100-5000 Hz is suitable for this purpose.\n\t\tNOTE: The data gathering frequency in optical tweezers experiments is often higher than it is necessary for the analysis - in the presented experiments, the data gathering frequency is set to 78 125 Hz by default. Since storage space is limited, it is convenient and timesaving to reduce the sampling rate of the data. Here, the raw data were downsampled by a factor of 30.",
    "Next, employ a signal filter to reduce the high frequency measurement noise from the signal (Figure 4A). Adjust the filter degree and cut-off frequency parameters accordingly to optimize data output of different experiments (Figure 5).\n\t\tNOTE: Amongst signal filters, Butterworth filter51 is one of the most widely used. A custom-written python script allowing the pre-processing of raw data is provided in the supplementary data. Downsampling and signal filtering parameters (cut-off frequency, filter degree) need to be optimized for different experiments.\nFor force-ramp data analysis, use the following steps.\n\t\nMark the steps either manually by finding corresponding points on the force trajectory plot or by using custom-written scripts. Unfolding steps are characterized by a sudden drop in force combined with an increase in distance in the force-distance (FD) curve.\nOnce unfolding events are marked, fit different regions of the FD curve using appropriate models (Figure 4D).\n\t\tNOTE: For the region before the first unfolding step, the tether can be considered \"double-stranded\" and is commonly fit using an extensible Worm-like-chain model (WLC)47,52,53. The parts after the first unfolding event are considered a combination of double-stranded nucleotides (handles) and single-stranded nucleotides (unfolded RNA molecule). Therefore, data fitting is more complex - usually a combination of 2 WLC models or WLC and Freely-jointed chain (FJC) models are employed36,39,52. The extensible WLC model has two main fit parameters the contour length (LC) and the persistence length (LP). Contour length corresponds to the length of the fully stretched molecule and persistence length defines the bending properties of the molecule of interest. The model can be described with the following equation (1). WLC can be used to model the behavior of both folded as well as unfolded regions, although for each of these a separate model with different parameters has to be employed.\n\t\t(1) imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62589/62589eq01.jpg",
    "where x is extension, LC is contour length, F is force, LP is persistence length, kB is Boltzmann constant, T is Thermodynamic temperature, and S is stretch modulus.\n\t\tThe second model called Freely-jointed chain (FJC) is commonly used to describe behavior of unfolded single stranded regions. It uses similar parameters of the polymers but treats each unit of the \"chain\" as a rigid rod, here corresponding to the nucleotides of the unfolded single stranded region. The following equation (2) describes this model:\n\t\t(2) imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62589/62589eq02.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: Our lab has recently developed an algorithm that allows batch processing of the raw force-ramp data called \"Practical Optical Tweezers Analysis TOol (POTATO)54.\" The algorithm downsamples and filters the data, then it identifies possible unfolding steps and finally performs data fitting. The POTATO is built in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) (https://github.com/REMI-HIRI/POTATO).\nProcess constant-force data as follows:\n\tNOTE: The following instructions can be analogically applied on constant-position data.\n\t\nFor the constant-force data, plot the distance over time (Figure 5). A histogram showing the frequency (counts) of different conformations over the relative change in position is a useful way to characterize various dominant and minor states (Figure 7).\nFit the histogram using (multiple) Gaussian functions to estimate the overall percentage of individual conformers at a given force (Figure 7C). The Gaussian fits, mean position, and the standard deviation outlines the force-related relationship among different populations.\n\t\tNOTE: A custom-written python script allowing pre-processing and basic bimodal Gaussian fitting of constant-force data is provided in the supplementary data. Parameters (cut-off frequency, filter degree, expected means, standard deviation values and amplitudes) need to be optimized for different experiments.",
    "Next, employ the Hidden Markov model to further analyze the states, which may uncover additional folding intermediates (conformers)55. For further information on the constant-force and Hidden Markov model, one may refer to55,56,57,58.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
