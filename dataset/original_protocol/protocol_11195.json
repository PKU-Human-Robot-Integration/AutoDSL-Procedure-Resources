    "Prior to blood collection, informed consent from subjects participating in the research is required and must be obtained. The research described in this manuscript was performed in accordance and compliance with the Rabin Medical Center, Israel ethic committee (ethic code: 0039-17-RMC) and the Faculty of Medicine Der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Germany ethic committee (ethic code: D 405/14).\n1. Blood sample collection and storage in cfDNA or cfRNA preservative tubes\nProperly label the preservation tubes\nCollect ~8 mL of blood into the cf-DNA preservation tube (see Table of Materials), using a blood collection set and a holder, as per the standard institutional protocol for venipuncture as described below.\n\tNOTE: The use of a blood collection set may prevent possible backflow of the blood from the tube.\n\t\nAlign the patient with the arm in a downward position.\nHold the tube upright, with the cap faced upward, while ensuring that the tube contents do not touch the cap or needle tip.\nAs blood starts flowing into the tube, release the tourniquet slowly.\nImmediately after the tube is filled with blood (maximum capacity: 8.4 mL of whole blood), gently invert the tube (turn the wrist of the arm that is holding the tube by 180° downward and back) 5 times to stabilize the sample.\n\tNOTE: Inversion ensures the preservative is mixed uniformly with the sample. However, do not shake the contents again, even before plasma preparation. Insufficient mixing of preservatives with the blood sample leads to destabilization of the contents and the formation of micro clots or hemolysis. At this stage, the protocol can be continued immediately for plasma separation or blood-filled tubes can wait for up to 30 days at ambient temperature (15-25 °C), and up to 8 days at 37 °C.\n2. Plasma and buffy coat separation and storage",
    "Centrifuge the blood-filled preservation tube at 425 x g for 20 min at room temperature to separate plasma.\n\tNOTE: Steps 2.2 and 2.3 should be performed in a biosafety cabinet.\nCarefully pipette out the upper plasma layer to a fresh tube in 1 mL aliquots, without disturbing the lower layers.\nCarefully transfer the next layer of buffy coat to a fresh tube (the layer appears as a ring above the RBC pellets), while avoiding RBCs in the lower layer.\nProceed to step 3 with plasma and step 4 with the buffy coat. If needed store the separated contents at -80 °C.\n3. Purification of circulating cfDNA from 1 mL of plasma\nNOTE: This step is performed with a commercial kit (see Table of Materials). All buffers are provided with the kit.\nPreparation of buffers and reagents\n\tCAUTION: Do not add acidic solutions or bleach directly to the sample preparation waste. Guanidine salts present in Lysis buffer, Binding buffer, and Wash Buffer-1 when combined with bleach or acids can produce highly reactive compounds.\n\t\nBinding buffer: Mix 300 mL of Binding buffer concentrate with 200 mL of 100% isopropanol to make 500 mL of working Binding buffer. Store at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Binding buffer allows the optimal binding of the circulating nucleic acids to the silica membrane. 500 mL of the binding buffer is sufficient for processing 276, 138, 92, 69 or 55 samples of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 mL of plasma respectively and is stable for 1 year at room temperature.\nWash Buffer-1: Mix 19 mL of Wash Buffer-1 concentrate with 25 mL of 96–100% ethanol to make 44 mL of working Wash Buffer-1. Store at room temperature.",
    "NOTE: Wash Buffer-1 eliminates the contaminants bound to the silica membrane. 44 mL of working Wash Buffer-1 is sufficient for processing 73 samples of 1/2/3/4/5 mL of plasma and is stable for 1 year at room temperature.\nWash Buffer-2: Mix well 13 mL Wash Buffer-2 concentrate with 30 mL of 96–100% ethanol to make 43 mL of working Wash Buffer-2. Store at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Wash Buffer-2 eliminates the contaminants bound to the silica membrane. 43 mL of working Wash Buffer-2 is sufficient for processing ~56 samples of 1/2/3/4/5 mL of plasma and is stable for 1 year at room temperature.\nTo a tube containing 310 μg lyophilized carrier RNA, add 1,550 μL of Elution buffer, to prepare a carrier RNA solution of 0.2 μg/μL. After thoroughly dissolving the carrier RNA, divide the solution to suitable aliquots, and store at –30 °C to –15 °C. Do not freeze-thaw these aliquots more than 3 times. To the Lysis buffer, as shown in Table S1, add the reconstituted carrier RNA dissolved in the Elution buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: Because carrier RNA does not dissolve directly in Lysis buffer, it needs to be dissolved first in an Elution buffer and then in Lysis Buffer. Firstly, silica membrane-nucleic acids binding is enhanced when there are very few target molecules present in the sample. Secondly, the risk of RNA degradation is reduced because of the presence of large amounts of carrier RNA.\nBefore starting the isolation, bring the columns and samples to room temperature and adjust the sample volumes to 1 mL with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), if needed. Pre heat 2 water baths or heating blocks that contain 50 mL centrifuge tubes and 2 mL collection tubes to 60 °C and 56 °C, respectively.",
    "To a 50 mL centrifuge tube, add 100 μL of Proteinase K, 1 mL plasma, and 0.8 mL of Lysis buffer containing 1.0 μg of carrier RNA (prepared in step 3.1.4). Close the centrifuge tube with a cap and mix the contents by pulse-vortexing for 30 s, while ensuring a visible vortex in the tube. Thorough mixing of the contents is important for efficient lysis.\n\tNOTE: Immediately after vortexing, proceed to step 3.4, without delay.\nIncubate the solution at 60 °C for 30 min.\nRemove the cap, add 1.8 mL of the binding buffer to the tube, and thoroughly mix with pulse vortexing for 15–30 s after placing the cap.\nIncubate the resulting mixture for 5 min on ice and insert the silica membrane column into the vacuum apparatus that is connected to the vacuum pump. Then, firmly insert a 20 mL tube extender into the open column to prevent sample leakage.\nCarefully pour the incubated mixture into the tube extender of the column and switch on the vacuum pump. After all the lysate mixture completely runs through the columns, switch off the vacuum pump, release the pressure to 0 mbar, and remove and discard the tube extender.\n\tNOTE: Avoiding cross-contamination, the tube extender should be discarded carefully, to prevent its spreading over adjacent columns.\nRemove the column from the vacuum apparatus, insert into the collection tube, and centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 30 s at room temperature, to remove any residual lysate. Discard the flow-through.\nAdd 600 μL of Wash Buffer-1 into the column, centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature, discard the flow-through.\nAdd 750 μL of Wash Buffer-2 to the column, centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature, and discard the flow-through.",
    "Add 750 μL of ethanol (96–100%) to the column, centrifuge at 11,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature and discard the flow-through.\nCentrifuge the column at 20,000 x g for 3 min, by placing it in a clean 2 mL collection tube.\nDry the membrane column assembly completely by placing it into a new 2 mL collection tube with the lid open and incubating at 56 °C for 10 min.\nPlace the column in a clean 1.5 mL elution tube. To the center of the column membrane, apply 20–150 μL of Elution buffer and incubate at room temperature for 3 min with the lid closed.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the Elution buffer is equilibrated to room temperature. In case of using elution buffer less than 50 μL, ensure that it is dispensed carefully onto the center of the membrane. This helps with the complete elution of the bound DNA. However, the elution volume is not fixed and can be changed as per the downstream applications. The recovered eluate can be up to 5 μL and certainly less than the elution volume applied to the column.\nCentrifuge the recovered eluate in a microcentrifuge at 20,000 x g for 1 min to elute the nucleic acids, and store at -20 °C.\n4. Purification of genomic DNA from buffy coat\nNOTE: Commercial kit used in this protocol is mentioned in the Table of Materials. Buffers and reagents mentioned in the below protocol i.e., Lysis buffer A, Lysis buffer B, Wash buffer X, Wash Buffer Y, Proteinase Buffer, Elution buffer, and Proteinase K are part of this commercial kit.\nPreparation of the buffers and reagents",
    "CAUTION: Do not add acidic solutions or bleach directly to the sample preparation waste. Guanidine salts present in Lysis buffer B and Wash buffer X when combined with bleach or acids, can produce highly reactive compounds.\n\t\nWash Buffer Y: Mix well 12 mL of Wash Buffer Y concentrate with 48 mL ethanol (96–100%) to obtain 60 mL of working Wash Buffer Y. Store at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: 60 mL of working Wash Buffer Y is sufficient for processing 100 buffy coat samples and is stable for 1 year.\nProteinase K: Prepare Proteinase K solution by dissolving 30 mg lyophilized Proteinase K into 1.35 mL of Proteinase Buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: Total working solution of Proteinase K is sufficient for processing 52 buffy coat samples. Proteinase K working solution can be stored for at least 6 months at -20 °C.\nSteps before initiation of the procedure\n\t\nEquilibrate the buffy coat to room temperature.\nSet the heat block or water bath at 56 °C.\nSuspend buffy coat in Lysis buffer A to obtain a final volume of 200 μL. Then add 25 μL of Proteinase K solution, and 200 μL of Lysis buffer B. Mix by vortexing and incubate at 70 °C for 10–15 min. Ensure that the samples are completely covered with the lysis solution.\n\tNOTE: For processing series of samples, Proteinase K and Lysis buffer A may be premixed 10–15 minutes before the procedure, but no longer before that, as Proteinase K self-digests in Lysis buffer A without substrate.\nAdd 210 μL of 96–100% ethanol to the above mixture and vortex vigorously.\n\tNOTE: The addition of ethanol may form a stringy precipitate; however, this will not affect the DNA isolation. Be sure to load the precipitate also on the column, as shown in the following steps.",
    "Load the entire sample onto the silica column placed in a collection tube. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g. Place the column in a new collection tube and discard the previous tube along with flow-through.\n\tNOTE: Repeat the centrifugation step if the sample is not drawn completely through the matrix.\nAdd 500 μL of Wash buffer X, centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g, and discard the flow-through.\nPlace the column into the collection tube, add 600 μL of Wash Buffer Y onto the column, centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g, and discard the flow-through.\nAgain, place the column into the collection tube, and centrifuge the column for 1 min at 20,000 x g to dry the silica membrane.\nIncubate the column at room temperature for 1 min, placed into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and then add 100 μL of Elution buffer. Then, elute the DNA by centrifuging for 1 min at 11,000 x g and store at -20 °C.\n5. Quantification of cfDNA and genomic DNA using fluorometer\nBefore starting the protocol, perform the following steps.\n\t\nDilute 2 µL of eluted genomic DNA (from step 4.9) in 1:10 proportions with ultrapure nuclease-free water. Due to expected low concentrations, do not dilute cfDNA samples from step 3.15.\nEquilibrate the assay Standard #1 and assay Standard #2 to room temperature.\nPrepare a total of 6 thin-walled clear tubes of 0.5 mL size.\n\tNOTE: The protocol presented is for quantification of 2 cfDNA and 2 genomic DNA samples, therefore, 4 tubes for 4 samples and this assay requires 2 standards.\nLabel the lids of the tube.",
    "NOTE: Labeling on the side of the tube could interfere with the reading. Additionally, the assay standard tubes are labeled carefully, since calibration of the fluorometer requires that the standards are in the correct order.\nDilute the assay reagent in 1:200 with the Assay buffer to prepare the working solution. For 4 samples and 2 standards, use 6 µL of assay reagent plus 1,194 µL of Assay buffer to make 1,200 µL (200 µL in each tube) of working solution.\n\tNOTE: Do not use a glass container, instead use a clean plastic tube. Each tube must contain approximately 200 µL of the final volume (an assay standard tube must contain 190 µL of the working solution, and the sample tube must contain 180–199 µL of the working solution). Sufficient working solution must be prepared to accommodate all assay standards and samples.\nIn the working assay standard tubes, add 190 µL of working solution and 10 µL assay standard and mix the solution by vortexing for 2–3 s. Avoid the formation of bubbles within the solution.\nIn the sample tubes, add 198 µL working solution and 2 µL of cfDNA or genomic DNA. Mix the solution by vortexing for 2–3 s, and keep it incubated at room temperature for 2 min.\nIn the ‘Home’ screen of the fluorometer instrument, press ‘DNA’ and select ‘dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay’, to display the ‘Standards’ screen, then press ‘Yes’ on the fluorometer ‘Standards’ screen to read the standards.\nIn the sample chamber, insert the assay Standard #1 tube, close the lid, and press ‘Read’. Remove the tube once the reading is completed (approximately 3 s) and repeat the same step for Standard #2.",
    "A sample screen is displayed after the completion of the calibration process, then insert a sample tube and repeat step ‘5.8’. The “sample screen” will then display a value that correspond to the concentration of the sample after dilution in the sample tube.\nFor each sample repeat step ‘5.9’, until all samples are read.\nUse the following equation to calculate the actual concentration of the sample.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61449/61449equ01.jpg\n\tNOTE: The assay values are in ng/mL and corresponds to the concentration after dilution in the assay tube. Equation mentioned in above step 5.11, QF value is the value given by the fluorometer instrument, and x is the number of microliters of sample added to the assay tube. The units for QF values that are generated by the equation are similar to the value provided by the fluorometer. For example, if the value of the fluorometer is in ng/mL, the units for the concentration calculated by the equation are ng/mL.\n6. DNA fragment size distribution of cfDNA by fragment analyzer\nThe step before initiating the procedure: Equilibrate the DNA dye concentrate and DNA gel matrix to room temperature for 30 min.\nPreparation of the gel-dye mix\n\tCAUTION: Handle solutions with caution as DMSO is known to facilitate the entry of organic molecules into tissues.\n\t\nThoroughly thaw the DMSO by vortexing the DNA dye concentrate vial for 10 s. Pipette out 15 µL of this concentrate into a DNA gel matrix vial and store at 4 °C in the dark.\nAgain, vortex the capped vial for 10 s until mixing of the gel and dye is visualized.\nPour the mix on a spin filter to the top receptacle.\nMicrocentrifuge the spin filter at 2,240 x g ± 20% for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Label the prepared gel-dye in the tube and discard the filter, as per good laboratory practices. Label the tube and record the date of preparation.\n\t\tNOTE: Discard the filtrate as per good laboratory practices. The gel-dye mix can be used for 5 High Sensitivity (HS) DNA chips. If unused for more than 1 h, store at 4 °C. Storage in the dark is possible for up to 6 weeks.\nTo load the gel-dye mix, ensure the position of the base plate of the chip priming station and adjust the clip at the lowest position.\n\t\nEquilibrate the gel-dye mix to room temperature for 30 min, while monitoring light exposure.\nTake a new HS DNA chip from a sealed bag and place it on the chip priming station, then remove 9.0 µL of the gel-dye mix and dispense it at the bottom of the chip well, marked as ‘G’.\n\t\tNOTE: Draw up the gel-dye mix, avoiding particles that may accumulate at the bottom of the vial. While dispensing the gel-dye mix into the HS DNA chip well, insert the tip of the pipette completely, to prevent the formation of large air bubbles. Moreover, touching the pipette at the edges of the well will produce poor results.\nPosition the plunger at 1 mL and close the chip priming station. Ensure the lock of the latch clicks and set the timer to 60 s, then press the plunger down until it is held by the clip, and exactly after 60 s, release the plunger with the clip-release mechanism.",
    "When the plunger retreats at least to the 0.3 mL mark, wait for 5 s, and then slowly pull back to the 1 mL position, then open the chip priming station and again remove 9.0 µL of the gel- dye mix and dispense at the bottom of the HS DNA chip well, marked as ‘G’.\nTo load the DNA marker, dispense 5 µL of the DNA marker into the well, marked with the ladder symbol. Repeat the procedure for all the 11 sample wells.\nTo load the ladder and samples, dispense 1 µL of the DNA ladder in the well, marked with the ladder symbol and then add 1 µL of sample (used wells) or 1 µL of marker (unused wells) in all the 11 sample wells.\nVortex the HS DNA chip for 60 s at 2,400 rpm by placing the chip horizontally in the adapter. Ensure that the bulge that fixes the HS DNA chip is not damaged during vortexing.\nTo insert the HS DNA chip in the fragment analyzer instrument, open the lid and ensure that the electrode cartridge is properly inserted, and the chip selector is positioned to ‘dsHigh Sensitivity DNA’ in the fragment analyzer instrument.\nCarefully mount the HS DNA chip into the receptacle, which fits one way only, then lose the lid by ensuring that the electrode cartridge fits exactly into the wells of the HS DNA chip.\nThe display on the fragment analyzer software screen indicates the inserted HS DNA chip and the closed lid, through the chip icon at the top left of the screen.",
    "To initiate the HS DNA chip run, select the dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay from the ‘Assay’ menu on the instrument screen, then properly fill the table of sample names by feeding information such as sample names and comments and start the chip run by clicking the ‘Start’ button at the upper right of the screen.\nElectrode cleaning after an HS DNA chip run: Immediately remove the used HS DNA chip, as soon as the assay is completed and dispose of it according to good laboratory practices. Perform the following procedure to ensure the electrodes are clean, without leftover residues from the previous assay.\n\t\nFill slowly 350 µL of deionized analysis-grade water into one of the electrode cleaner wells and place the electrode cleaner in the fragment analyzer instrument by opening the lid and then close the lid and wait for about 10 s.\nRemove the electrode cleaner by opening the lid and wait for another 10 s, for the water on the electrodes to evaporate before closing the lid.\nSubscription Required.
