    "This protocol describes the process to obtain fragment (2), required for the synthesis of an epoxomicin-based probe amenable to click chemistry (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-fig-0001]). This fragment is synthesized using standard solid-phase conditions following Fmoc-based synthesis, from C- to N-terminus, using a high loading Wang-Thr resin, which proved to be high yielding, even at >1 g scale (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-fig-0002]). Following synthesis of the Thr-Ile-Ile peptide fragment, a PEG2 linker was attached and subsequent addition of an N-methyl propargyl amine was carried out via bromoacetic acid coupling. After cleavage from the resin, the crude material was precipitated using cold diethyl ether and dried. No purification is required at this stage.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c9580e49-f891-45ad-ac43-28e18e4b611d/cpz1490-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\n(A) Structure of epoxomicin (1), a potent proteasome inhibitor: (B) structure of the clickable peptide fragment (2) synthesized via solid-phase; (C) structure of the designed clickable epoxomicin-based probe (3).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/12d549c7-82a7-415c-9ecf-4de9de060143/cpz1490-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\n(A) Total ion chromatogram (TIC) of the synthesized peptide fragment.

Weigh Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-Wang resin in fritted syringe.\nThe resin used in the described procedure is 0.61 mmol/g. The amount used can be as high as 1 g in a single syringe without detrimental effects on the final yield.\nBe mindful of the size of the syringe based on the scale, as the resin beads will grow when in contact with DMF.\n2. Cap the bottom of the syringe and add 2 ml DMF to cover entirely the resin beads.\nThe amount of DMF can vary depending on the amount of resin used. Typically, between 2 and 5 ml of solvent is sufficient.\n3. Insert syringe plunger and push far enough to maximize contact between the resin beads and the solvent.\nPush gently. Be sure to remove the bottom cap first to avoid pressure buildup.\n4. Incubate the syringe for 30 to 60 min at room temperature with shaking to allow the resin beads to swell.\n5. Remove the plunger and place syringe on manifold to drain the solvent.\n6. Cap the bottom of the syringe and add 2 ml of 20% piperidine in DMF to deprotect the Fmoc group.\n7. Place syringe plunger back into the syringe and incubate for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. Put syringe on a manifold and drain the solution.\n8. Wash resin three times with 2 to 5 ml of DMF and validate complete removal of the Fmoc group by performing a Kaiser test:",
    "Add 1 to 2 drops of each of the 3 Kaiser reagents into a small round-bottom rimless glass tube.\nUsing a glass pipette, remove a small amount of resin beads from the syringe and transfer them to the glass tube.\nHeat the glass tube at ≥95°C for 5 min and check the color of the beads:\nA dark blue/purple coloration indicates a positive result (presence of primary amines). Slight to no change in color indicates the absence of primary amines, therefore, a negative result.\nIf the amount of resin beads is too small to confidently observe, use a white-light microscope to examine them more closely.\nIf the Kaiser test yields partial or no color change in the resin beads, repeat steps 6–8. If test is positive, proceed.\n9. Weigh out 4 equivalents of Fmoc-Ile-OH and 4 equivalents of HBTU. Dissolve in 2 ml DMF then add 8 equivalents of DIPEA to the mixture.\nColoration of the solution indicates activation of amino acid.\n10. Vortex mixture thoroughly and add solution to the resin. Incubate syringe for 1 hr at room temperature.\n11. Repeat steps 5–10 using Fmoc-Ile-OH once again. This “double coupling” ensures complete coupling to the resin.\nThe beads should be dark blue/purple after Fmoc cleavage, and no coloration should be observed after the addition of amino acid, indicating successful amide coupling.\n12. Repeat steps 5–10 using PEG2 linker.\nThree equivalents of linker and 6 equivalents of DIPEA can also render successful coupling reactions when the prepared solution is concentrated (1–1.5 ml of DMF).\n13. Repeat steps 3–7. Wash resin with 2 ml anhydrous DMF and perform the Kaiser test.",
    "While this protocol describes the synthesis of a chemical probe containing only one PEG2 linker fragment, additional couplings of the linker can be done as well. This will generate a more challenging substrate for the proteasome isoforms, thus providing a wider dynamic range and increasing the likelihood of identifying less potent proteasome modulators in drug discovery campaigns.\n14. Weigh out enough BAA to make 1 ml of a 2 M solution in dry DMF and prepare 1 ml of 1 M DIC in dry DMF.\nMake fresh solutions before each coupling. Flush the BAA bottle with argon/nitrogen before and after each use to ensure adequate storage.\n15. Mix BAA and DIC solutions and agitate in shaker until a white precipitate is observed.\nThe precipitate is typically observed within <5 min of reaction time and it works as a visual indicator of BAA activation; however, it also means the conversion of the activated species to an inactive isomer. Therefore, the mixture should not be agitated after the precipitate is evident to the naked eye.\n16. Cap the bottom of the syringe and add the 2 ml mixture of activated BAA. Insert the plunger and incubate at 37°C for 20 min with shaking.\nDo not incubate longer or at higher temperatures. The alpha carbon on the carboxylic acid is highly reactive, and extending the time can generate unwanted side products.\n17. Drain solution, wash three times with 2 ml anhydrous DMF and perform the Kaiser test.\nThe Kaiser test result should be negative since coupling of activated BAA to the free amine yields an amide bond. Do not let the resin sit too long before the next coupling as the bromine can become hydrolyzed by water in the atmosphere.",
    "18. Prepare 1.5 ml of a 1 M solution of N-methylpropargylamine in anhydrous DMF.\n19. Add solution to the resin and incubate at 37°C for 1 hr with shaking.\n20. Wash resin three times with 2 ml DMF and three times with DCM. Allow the resin to dry by pulling vacuum through the syringe.\nUsing DCM after washing with DMF is key to remove the DMF, which is otherwise difficult to remove.\n21. Cleave peptide from resin by adding 3 ml of cleavage solution and incubating the syringe at room temperature for 2 hr.\n22. Collect the resulting solution in a conical tube and wash beads three times with 3 ml DCM.\n23. Carefully place a stream of argon/nitrogen over the top of the solution to evaporate the mixture of solvents until a viscous residue remains.\n24. Add prechilled diethyl ether to the crude material and centrifuge at 4500 × g for 10 min.\nThe amount of diethyl ether to be used varies depending on the reaction scale. Typically, 3 to 5 ml is adequate for washing away side products.\n25. Decant the diethyl ether and vacuum-dry the resulting product until a solid is observed.\nA yield of 75%-85% of crude material should be obtained based on loading of the Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-Wang resin.\n26. Store product at −20°C until coupling of the epoxy-ketone fragment is conducted (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-prot-0002]).",
    "Once the clickable peptidomimetic fragment is synthesized, an in-solution amide linkage is performed after protection of the Thr hydroxyl group using conventional coupling reagents in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The crude material is dried under vacuum and resuspended in methanol (MeOH) for reverse-phase HPLC purification.

Weigh out (2) into Vial A and dissolve material in 1 ml anhydrous THF.\nBest results are obtained with new bottles of anhydrous THF (Sigma SureSeal bottle); otherwise, freshly distilled THF over Na/benzophenone is recommended if commercial dry THF is unavailable.\n3. Flush argon/nitrogen inside vial A and cap it.\n4. Weigh out 2 equivalents of TBSCl and 2.2 equivalents of imidazole. Add them to vial A, flush with argon/nitrogen and cap.",
    "5. Place vial A on stir plate and allow the mixture to stir for 18 hr.\nThe time required for the reaction was determined arbitrarily. The reagents were always allowed to react overnight; therefore, the reaction time can range from 12 to 18 hr.\n6. Weigh 1.05 equivalents of HBTU and 1.05 equivalents of HOBt and add them to vial A. Add 3 equivalents of DIPEA and flush the vial with argon/nitrogen.\nWhile regular DIPEA can be used, the best results are obtained with dry DIPEA. This amine readily absorbs moisture from air; therefore, distilling it from CaH2 under argon and then storing it with activated molecular sieves under argon provides higher yields. Alternatively, anhydrous DIPEA in septa sealed bottles can be purchased, if desired.\n7. Place vial A on stir plate and allow the mixture to react for 30 min.\n8. Weigh 1.05 equivalents of (S)-2-Amino-4-methyl-1-((r)-2-methyloxiran-2-yl)pentan-1- 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate and add them to oven-dried vial B. Dissolve the mixture in 0.5 ml anhydrous THF then add 3 equivalents of DIPEA.\n9. Flush argon/nitrogen inside vial B and cap. Place vial on stir plate and allow the mixture to react for 5 to 10 min.\n10. Transfer solution from vial B to vial A and allow the mixture to react at room temperature for 4 to 5 hr.\nTransfer must be done under argon. Rinse vial B with additional 0.5 ml dry THF to ensure complete transfer of material.\nSynthesis of final product can be monitored by LC/MS. No significant conversion of starting material was observed beyond 5 hr; the generation of side products increases with longer reaction times.\n11. Concentrate crude material in rotary evaporator and redissolve in MeOH.",
    "No work-up process is conducted in order to avoid water-mediated epoxide ring opening. Further, the TBS group comes off in situ during the HPLC purification when 0.1% TFA is present in solvents used as mobile phases.\nThe amount of MeOH for dissolving the crude product depends on the scale of the reaction, the HPLC system, and the column used for purification.\n12.

An additional mass observed in the spectrum correlates with the doubly charged state (377.2 m/z).\n13. Combine the fractions containing the desired compound and concentrate them in a rotary evaporator to remove ACN and TFA.\n14. Freeze the solution at −80°C and lyophilize until a powder is obtained.\nAfter HPLC purification, the purified yield should be between 70% and 80%. The amount obtained will depend on the amount of starting material, but we have successfully performed this reaction at up to 250 mg scale.\nStore the powder at −20°C as is or dissolved in DMSO.",
    "While the synthesized alkynyl fragment (2) possesses an intrinsic electrophile and a peptide recognition sequence for the proteasome in order for this probe be useful for imaging and activity analyses, a reporter tag must be incorporated into the structure before or after in cellulo treatment (i.e., bioconjugation). This protocol details the copper-catalyzed ligation of an azide-containing cell permeable fluorophore with fragment (2) using copper sulfate as the copper source and sodium ascorbate as the reducing agent for generation of copper ions in the +1 oxidation state. The crude material from this protocol is purified using the same HPLC method as described above and lyophilized into a powder (Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-fig-0004]).

Sterilization of the hood is to be carried out by UV light irradiation 10 min prior to starting any work and by spraying down the surface using 70% (v/v) ethanol in Mili-Q water. All items must be wiped with the ethanol solution as well before placing them inside the hood.\nAll stock vials containing cells should be kept in a liquid nitrogen freezer until use.\n1. Retrieve a frozen vial of HEK-293T cells from the freezer and thaw in a water bath at 37°C.\n2. After thawing the vial transfer the suspension to a sterile 15-ml conical tube and gradually dilute it to 10 ml using DMEM with 10% FBS.\nMedium should be added slowly to minimize osmotic shock, which will have a detrimental effect on cell viability.\n3.

Remove the plate from the incubator and dose each well with the synthesized activity-based probe. Place the plate back in the CO2 incubator for 1 hr.\nA final probe concentration of 250–2000 nM is recommended; however, performing a dose-response curve is advised if a different cell line or fluorophore is used.\nIf a molecule is to be tested for its ability to modulate the activity of the proteasome isoforms, prepare stock solutions at the desired concentrations, and incubate them for at least 1 hr before adding the activity-based probe.\nReplace the medium used to achieve the appropriate cell density with fresh medium containing the small molecules and/or the chemical probe to ensure an adequate supply of nutrients to the cells.\n19. Remove the plate from the incubator and vacuum aspirate the medium from each well. Add M-PERTM lysis buffer with 100X HaltTM protease cocktail to each well and agitate the plate on an orbital shaker for 10 min.",
    "The M-PER buffer is a convenient and mild lysis buffer suitable for a wide range of applications that allows the extraction of non-denatured proteins in high yields directly in plate. The amount of buffer recommended by the manufacturer is between 100 and 400 µl per well. For 24-well plate formats, 100 µl has been shown to be effective, yielding protein concentrations >3 mg/ml following the protocol here described.\nOptional: If partial cell detachment is observed; therefore, if desired, coating the plate with poly-D-lysine can be done to ensure full adherence of the cells to the bottom of the plate.\nDissolve 5 mg of poly-D-lysine hydrobromide in 50 ml of autoclaved Mili-Q water (100 µg/ml).\nFilter sterilize the resulting solution.

Use values shown in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-tbl-0002].\nLet the plate sit for 5 to 30 min at room temperature.\nVacuum aspirate the solution from each well and rinse the surface twice using the same volume of PBS.\nTable 2.\n                Stock Cell Suspensions and Volumes Needed by Plate\ntable:\n﻿Plate,Stock suspension (cells/ml),Volume per well (µl),Cells per well\n24-well,40 × 104,500,200000\n12-well,50 × 104,1000,500000\n6-well,1 × 106,2000,2000000\n20. Collect cell lysate in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 10 min and 4°C to pellet cell debris.\n21. Transfer the supernatant to fresh new tubes and measure the protein concentration following method of choice.\n22. Based on the measured protein concentration, aliquot the samples in such a way that the total protein is equal amongst them.\nFor in-gel fluorescence of the beta subunits of the proteasome in HEK-293T cells, between 25 and 50 µg of total protein is desired. This might need to be adjusted based on the biological system used and the fluorophore tested.",
    "23. Prepare loading buffer using 4× Laemmli sample buffer according to manufacturer instructions and add the necessary volume to each sample.\nBriefly vortex the samples to mix the loading buffer with the lysates.\n24. Heat samples in 95°C heat block for 5 to 10 min.\n25. Briefly centrifuge the samples and load them in a 10-well, 50-μl/well gradient gel with compatible ladder.\nIt is recommended to not load more than 45 µl to each well to avoid overflowing into adjacent wells. Load samples slowly without disrupting the bottom of the wells.\n26. Run the gel at 150 V and constant current for 55 min using 1× SDS Tris-HCl glycine running buffer and an electrophoresis cell with compatible power supply.\nTime and voltage might need to be adjusted if using a gel with a different concentration of acrylamide. Check for manufacturer's recommendations before running.\n27. Remove gel cassette from the electrophoresis cell and place the gel in a plastic box. Rinse three times with DI water.\n28. Image gel using biomolecular imager suitable for the selected fluorophore.\nIf desired, it is feasible to distinguish all catalytic subunits of the proteasome by using gradient gels and high-resolution settings.\nBand density can be quantified using Image StudioTM, ImageJ, or other software programs.\n29. Coomassie stain the gel for 30 to 60 min to ensure equal protein loading, and destain for 4 to 24 hr, or until the background is clear. See example in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-fig-0005].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3b173cbd-1340-41f9-8d91-0e74eac53e62/cpz1490-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",

    "Analysis of proteasome activity can be performed by other techniques such as confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. This Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-prot-0005] is analogous to Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-prot-0004] with the main difference being the sample preparation for the proteasome activity analysis by flow cytometry instead of SDS-PAGE. Once cells are cultured and plated, the live cell samples are rinsed and resuspended in PBS. A viability dye is used to discriminate live versus dead populations and fluorescence is measured by flow cytometry. Gating is performed sequentially by forward scatter versus side scatter to differentiate cells from debris based on size and granularity. Exclusion of the dead cell population is done based on the viability dye used.\nMaterials\nFrozen vial of HEK-293T cells (ATCC® CRL-3216TM)\nDulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)\n1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS)\nIncubator with CO2\nUpright, bright-light microscope, with 4× and 20× lenses\n15-ml sterile conical tubes\nT-75 cell culture flask\n1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes\nTO-PRO™3 Ready Flow™ viability dye (ThermoFisher catalog No. R37170)\nIce\nIce bucket\nCell scraper\nStandard tabletop centrifuge\nBD Accuri™ C6 Plus Flow Cytometer or compatible flow cytometer with fluorophore of choice\n1. Incubation of cells as well as plating is to be carried out following the procedure described in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-prot-0004] (steps 1–17)\n2. Remove the plate from the incubator and dose wells with the synthesized activity-based probe. Place the plate back in the CO2 incubator for 1 hr.\nA careful consideration of the appropriate controls is required for a successful experiment by flow cytometry (Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-tbl-0003]), therefore, make sure to have extra wells dedicated to the controls, as described in Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-tbl-0003].",
    "If desired, when using the viability dye for the first time, preparing a control with only dead cell populations by heating a sample of cells in a 95°C heating block for 5 to 10 min could be useful when assessing the difference between live and dead cells.\nTable 3.\n                Minimum Experimental Controls Required for Successful Proteasome Activity Analysis by Flow Cytometry\ntable:\n﻿Controls,Fluorescent probe,Viability dye\nUnstained,No,No\nNo probe,No,Yes\nNo viability dye,Yes,No\n3. Remove the plate from the incubator and place on ice. Carefully vacuum aspirate the DMEM from each well.\n4. Add 200 µl cold PBS to each well and gently dislodge the cells from the bottom of the plate using a cell scraper.\n5. Collect the cell suspensions in a fresh tube and centrifuge at 4°C for 3 min at 300 × g.\n6. Discard supernatant and resuspend in 200 µl of cold PBS. Centrifuge again as in Step 5.\nThis washing process is necessary to remove unreacted probe present in the samples and thus avoid inaccurate fluorescence readings.\n7. Remove supernatant and resuspend in another 200 µl of cold PBS. Add 20 µl of viability dye to all samples excepting the unstained and no viability dye controls. Incubate samples for 20 min at room temperature.\n8. Proceed with flow cytometry analysis by recording 50,000 events per sample. See example in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.490#cpz1490-fig-0006].\nMix samples by pipetting up and down before analysis. Do not vortex.\nA sequential gating should be performed where a forward versus side scatter gating is used in the first level to differentiate cells from debris. A second level gating is performed in the channel corresponding to the excitation/emission wavelength of the dye, so that dead cells can be distinguish from live cells by the extent of fluorescence after incubation with the viability dye.",
    "TO-PROTM 3 Ready FlowTM is a membrane-impermeable dye that binds to double-stranded DNA of dead cells; thus, dead populations can be distinguished alive ones by a shift in the fluorescence observed, in this case, the allophycocyanin (APC) channel.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/730dbda4-3faa-46b4-b6a3-8d09820a97d3/cpz1490-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\n(A) Forward versus side scatter (FSC vs. SSC) gating.
