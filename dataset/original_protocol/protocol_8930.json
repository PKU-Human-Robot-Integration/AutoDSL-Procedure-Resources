    "1. Construct the Surgery Apparatus\nNOTE: To ensure the fish remains alive during and after the operation, drip anesthesia solution ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate (MS-222, or Tricaine) at a half concentration (0.015%) with a velocity of 1 drop/sec through the fish's mouth using a homebuilt drip system shown in Figure 1.\nMake a box as shown in Figure 1A (length is 28 cm, width is 10 cm, height is 5 cm), put a sponge (length is 6 cm, width is 9 cm, height is 4 cm) in the middle and open a gap on it.\nMake a smooth globular surface on the end of the needle with light curing bond (Figure 1B) which will then be inserted into the fish mouth. Ensure that the surface of the needle is smooth to prevent the fish's mouth from being damaged.\nAdd the half concentration of MS-222 (left chamber, length is 6 cm, width is 10 cm, height is 8 cm) and saline (right chamber, length is 4 cm, width is 10 cm, height is 8 cm) to the reservoirs as shown in Figure 1C. Note: Fresh MS-222 is recommended.\nAnesthetize fish in 0.03% MS-222 for 2 min.\nPlace the fish in the gap of the sponge and fix the fish with two pairs of pins, inserted behind the pectoral fin and beside the cloacal pore, respectively11.\nConnect the fish’s mouth, MS-222, and rearing water with a T type tube as shown in Figure 1C.\nSwitch on the tube connected to the MS-222.\n2. Retrograde Label RGCs from the Right Tectum\nNOTE: Prior to beginning, disinfect all apparatuses with 70-75% ethanol, ensuring that no ethanol remains.\nRossing: slightly remove the skin over the whole skull with sclerectome (dorsal view of the skull is shown in Figures 2A and 2B).",
    "Clearing: wash the skull with saline and then dry it with ear washing bulb.\nInitial corrosion: corrode the skull with the etchant for 10 sec.\nClearing: completely wipe away the etchant with a cotton swab and then wash the area with saline and dry it.\nProtection: in order to protect the skull in other areas except the right tectum from excess corrosion, cover these areas with light curing bond and then cure it by exposure to blue light with portable illuminant.\nComplete corrosion: put the etchant in the central area of the right tectum again for complete etching for 2 min. Note: Since skulls of older fish are calcified, corrosion will take longer.\nClearing: completely wipe away the etchant with a cotton swab and then wash the area with saline and dry it again.\nSkull opening: carefully remove the malacic skull (Figure 2C) with forceps to expose the right tectum (Figure 2D).\nClearing: wipe the mucus and blood effusing from the hole with pieces of gelfoam and wash it with saline until the bleeding has stopped.\nDye placement: put the dye (tissue-labeling paste) on the whole right tectum and cover it with gelfoam.\nSegregating: cover the hole with a sterile scale from the same animal.\nSealing: place light curing bond onto the scale and then cure it with blue light again for 40 sec.\nRevival: wash the surface of the bond and revive the animal with saline.\nNursing and breeding: Keep the fish in 28.5 °C embryo medium (ZFIN) for 5 days and feed 2 times/day. Do not include fish whose dye fails to stay in the tectum for 5 days in the experiment. Note: Embryo medium (EM) solution is vital for fish survival and temperature is the key factor for DiI labeling.\n3. Wholemounting Retina and Imaging",
    "Place the fish in a dark field for 2 hr before retina wholemount.\nAnesthetize the fish with ice water.\nPuncture a hole in the margin of cornea and make an eye cup by removing the cornea with venus scissors.\nRemove the lens and then flush the center of retina with ice-cold 1x PBS.\nFlush the gap between retina and sclera with ice-cold 1x PBS until no pigment is left.\nCut the optic nerve at the disc.\nKeep the RGC layer upward and hold the retina with a self-made glass spoon (Figures 3A and 3B). A dropper can also be used to transfer the retina.\nPut the retina in a drop of icy 30% glycerin on a slide with the RGC layer upward (Figure 3C).\nRemove the glycerin and then flatten the retina on the glass slide before cutting retina into four quadrants (Figure 3D). Keeping the retina unfolded with RGC layer upward will be helpful for flattening the retina.\nDrip icy 50% glycerin on the retina to wash away the fragments of pigment.\nRemove the glycerin and then drop 20 µl of icy 75% glycerin on the retina.\nCover the sample with a 1.8 cm x 1.8 cm square coverslip.\nSeal the coverslip with nail polish. Immediate imaging of the retina is recommended.\nNon-interlace image the whole retina under a 20X object lens (NA=0.70) with DP72 CCD (each image is 1360 x 1024 pixels). Each field has three different focuses.\nExtend the depth of each field with the tool of “extended depth of field” in the software.\nAssemble a virtual retina with the function of photomerge.\nSelect three fields of 680 x 512 pixels (actual area is 350 µm by 264 µm, 0.092 mm2) in each orientation of the retina to analyze average density of RGCs (Figure 4A).",
    "Obtain the area with the function of measurements – create a polygon feature in the image software.\nCalculate the total number of RGCs by the equation “RGCs number = destiny x area” 9.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
