    "1. Making the Phosphate Buffered Saline with Tween-20 (PBST) Buffer\nDissolve one PBS tablet (0.01 M phosphate buffer, 0.0027 M Potassium Chloride, 0.137 M Sodium Chloride, pH 7.4) in 200 ml deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm).\nAdd 100 µl (0.05 (v/v)%) Tween-20 to the 200 ml buffer solution as a surfactant.\n2. Preparing the Carboxyl Polystyrene Particle Standards\nVortex the calibration particles for 30 sec before sonication for 2 min at 80 watts to create monodispersity of the particles.\nDilute the calibration particles 1 in 100 to a concentration of 1x1010 particles/ml in PBST buffer and vortex for 30 sec.\n3. Preparing Streptavidin Coated Particles\nVortex the particles for 30 sec before sonication for 2 min at 80 watts to ensure monodispersity.\nDilute the streptavidin coated particles 1 in 100 in PBST buffer to achieve a resulting concentration of 1x109 particles/ml and vortex for 30 sec.\n\tNote: A typical sample volume is 200 µl. For example, if investigating five DNA concentrations prepare 1 ml of diluted streptavidin coated particles.\n4. Preparation of Oligonucleotides\nReconstitute oligonucleotides with deionized water to a resulting concentration of 100 µM.\n5. Addition of Capture Probe (CP) DNA to the Streptavidin Coated Particles\nPrior to DNA binding, vortex the streptavidin coated particles (200 µl sample volume) for 30 sec followed by a 2 min sonication at 80 watts.\nBased on the binding capacity provided by the supplier (4,352 pmol/mg), add the appropriate concentration of DNA to the particles for resulting concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 47, 95, 140, and 210 nM DNA.\nVortex the samples for 10 sec and place on a rotary wheel at room temperature for 30 min to allow for the DNA to bind to the particle surfaces via a streptavidin-biotin interaction.",
    "Once the capture DNA has been added and incubated with the streptavidin coated particles, remove the excess DNA in solution via magnetic separation by placing the samples onto a magnetic rack for 30 min.\nRemove the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the newly formed cluster of particles closest to the magnet, and replace with the same volume of new PBST buffer.\n6. Hybridizing Complementary DNA to the CP-particles\nAdd the required amount of target DNA (in excess at 500 nM) to ensure the maximum possible target binding was reached.\nVortex the samples for 10 sec and place on a rotary wheel at room temperature for 30 min.\nOnce the hybridization is complete, remove the excess target DNA via magnetic separation by placing the samples onto a magnetic rack for 30 min.\nRemove the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the newly formed cluster of particles closest to the magnet, and replace with the same volume of new PBST buffer.\nRepeat steps 6.1 to 6.4 for duplicate samples and place these samples on a rotary wheel at room temperature for 16 hours to investigate DNA hybridization times.\n7. TRPS Setup\nPlug in the instrument into a computer system with software in place.\nCalibrate the initial stretch using a caliper.\n\t\nMeasure the distance between the outside of two parallel jaws.\nInput into the software by typing the stretch in the 'stretch' field in the 'Instrument Settings' tab and clicking 'Calibrate stretch' underneath the tab.\nLaterally fit a polyurethane nanopore membrane of appropriate sizing for analysis onto the jaws with the nanopore ID number facing upward. Then, stretch the jaws to the stretch required for analysis using the stretch adjustment handle on the side of the instrument. Stretch the jaws between 43 and 48 mm.",
    "Note: The exact value of the stretch is determined alongside applied voltage so that calibration particle blockades are at least 0.3 nA in size. The stretch is already inputted into the software in step 7.2 and will automatically adjust as the jaws are stretched.\nPlace 80 µl of PBST buffer in the lower fluid cell, beneath the nanopore, ensuring there are no bubbles present that may affect the measurement. If there are bubbles seen, remove and replace the buffer.\nClick the upper fluid cell into place and place 40 µl of buffer into it, again ensuring there are no bubbles present. If bubbles are present in the upper fluid cell, remove them by replacing the liquid.\nWhen a reproducible baseline current has been reached from replacing the upper fluid cell with buffer, add 40 µl of the sample to the upper fluid cell and measure by clicking 'start' in the 'Data Acquisition' tab on the software screen.\n\tNote: The data acquisition is completed at a frequency of 50 kHz with a blockade magnitude lower limit of 0.05 nA, although this can be altered using the software via the 'Analyse Data' tab (under 'Analysis Settings' and 'Resistive Blockades').\nPlace a Faraday cage over the top of the fluid cell system to reduce electrical background noise on the measurements.\nUse a variable pressure module (VPM) to apply a pressure or vacuum to the samples.\n\t\nTo apply an external pressure connect the nozzle to the upper fluid cell, then rotate the pressure arm and click into place (depending on whether a positive pressure (PRE) or a vacuum (VAC) will be applied).",
    "Apply pressure in a 'cm' or 'mm' scale using the pressure stage knob situated on the top of the VPM. Press the knob down to apply pressure on the 'cm' scale and pull it upward to apply pressure on the 'mm' scale.\n8. Preparing Samples for TRPS Analysis\nVortex samples for 30 sec and sonicate for 2 min at 80 watts prior to TRPS analysis.\n9. Calibrating the Nanopore for Zeta Analysis\nAfter placing 40 µl calibration particles (1x1010 particles/ml) into the upper fluid cell, complete a TRPS measurement (setup as in section 7) at 3 applied voltages. Alter the voltage by clicking on the '+' and '-' buttons on the voltage scale in the 'Instrument Settings' tab on the software.\nCheck that the 3 voltages return background currents of approximately 140, 110, and 80 nA. Ensure that at the medium voltage the calibration particles produce an average blockade magnitude of at least 0.3 nA.\nApply a pressure so the average full width half maximum (FWHM) durations of the calibration particles are at least 0.15 msec. Do this manually using the pressure arm attached to the variable pressure module. Select pressure (PRE) or vacuum (VAC) by rotating the arm until it clicks in the desired position and apply accordingly following set up instructions in step 7.8.2. Once these conditions have been achieved, start the run by clicking 'start' on the software in the 'Data Acquisition' tab.\nComplete the run by pressing 'stop' in the 'Data Acquisition' tab when at least 500 particles have been measured (see 'Particle Count' at the bottom of the software screen during the measurement) and the run has exceeded 30 sec (see 'Run Time' also toward the bottom of the screen).",
    "Calibrate the system by completing a calibration run as described every time a new nanopore is introduced or for each new day of analysis by completing step 9.1-9.4.\n10. Running a Sample\nRun the samples at the highest or second highest voltage as the calibration samples at ensuring a similar (±10 nA), if not the same, baseline current.\n\t\nOnce the appropriate baseline current is achieved, replace the electrolyte in the upper fluid cell with 40 µl of sample. When a sample is introduced, blockades will be seen on the signal trace. Start the sample run by clicking 'start' in the 'Data Acquisition' tab and record a minimum of 500 particles (check 'Particle Count' situated under the signal trace) and ensure the run time is a minimum of 30 sec (see 'Run Time' also situated below the signal trace).\nTo complete the measurement, click 'stop' in the 'Data Acquisition tab' and save the data file.\nTo save the file, input the file information in the following format; 'Investigation' is the folder the file will be saved in, 'Nanopore ID' is the serial number of the pore being used, 'Part #' is the type of pore (i.e., NP150/NP200), 'Sample ID' is the name of the sample, 'Calibration or sample' details whether it is a calibration or sample measurement, 'Dilution' is used if the sample was diluted (type 100 if the sample was diluted 100-fold), 'Pressure' is the applied pressure to the sample (in cm - see section 7.8), 'Electrolyte ID' is the name of the buffer the sample is made up in, and 'Notes' are any personal notes about the sample or run.",
    "Between each sample run, wash the system by placing 40 µl of PBST buffer into the upper fluid cell several times and applying various pressures (usually at -10, -5 cm (vacuum), and 5 and 10 cm (positive pressure)) until no more blockade events are present, ensuring there are no residual particles remaining in the system and therefore no cross contamination between samples. Run samples in triplicate with this wash step completed between each repeat sample run as well as between different samples.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
