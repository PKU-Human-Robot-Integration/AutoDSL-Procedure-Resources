    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample enrichment for extracellular matrix proteins\nTiming: 4–5 h (for step 1)\nTiming: 30–60 min (for step 2) (may vary according to the number of samples and sonication protocol)\nTiming: 1 h (for step 3)\nTiming: 30–60 min (for step 4) (may vary according to the number of samples)\nFor label-free quantitative discovery proteomics, we employ a chemical fractionation strategy12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] to enrich fetal mouse kidneys and kidney organoids for the detection of extracellular matrix proteins. Although we describe here an application for mammalian kidney systems, this protocol has also been tested with different tissue types (e.g., skin, brain meninges, lungs, and heart) and organisms (e.g., Drosophila, C. elegans). For highly fibrous and/or keratinized tissues, additional steps may be necessary to ensure full solubilization of fractionation pellets.\nCritical: Ensure adequate use of personal protection equipment (lab coat, gloves, facial mask, safety glasses) throughout sample fractionation and following processing for mass spectrometry.\nDay 1: Extracellular matrix enrichment through chemical fractionation and sonication.\nNote: Your samples were stored at −80°C, in sample tubes.\nThaw kidney organoids and fetal mouse kidney samples and wash briefly with ice-cold PBS.\nCritical: Samples must be kept on ice all the time to minimize protein degradation.\nNote: In this study, at least 3 kidney organoids per time point were collected and pooled whilst 6 mouse fetal kidney samples (2 kidneys per fetus, approximately 8 mg of tissue) were processed individually.\nPlace the samples in clean Petri dishes and cut the samples into small pieces (roughly 1 mm3) using a sterile blade.\nNote: For adult kidney samples, remove the kidney capsule and pelvis prior to tissue homogenization as these compartments are fibrous and may interfere with the efficiency of the enrichment strategy.\nCritical: Discard used blades in a biohazard sharps container.",
    "Add 0.5 mL–1 mL of ice-cold PBS to the tissue homogenate to aid in collecting and transferring it to 1.5 mL sample tubes.\nIncubate the samples for 5 min on a rotator to remove residual blood.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C and discard the PBS. Repeat this step at least once until all PBS has been removed.\nAdd freshly prepared Tris-lysis buffer to samples tubes.\nFor kidney organoids, add 50 μL of Tris buffer.\nFor mouse fetal kidneys, add 100 μL–200 μL of Tris buffer.\nNote: Use the smallest possible volume of Tris lysis buffer - high volumes might be difficult to handle when processing the samples for later trypsin digestion. Furthermore, very dilute samples will yield poor protein coverage in the proteomic analysis. We recommend a 5:1 (v/w) ratio for buffer and tissue, respectively. For approximately 3 mg–5 mg of tissue, 200 μL of lysis buffer might be enough for processing.\nMechanically disrupt samples through repetitive pipetting using 200 μL pipette tips. Remember to keep the bottom of the tube on ice.\nNote: Consider using a syringe equipped with an 18- or 21-gauge needle to shear the partial homogenate by passing it through the needle, however, be careful with sample loss when using needles compared to pipette tips.\nCritical: Discard used needles in a biohazard sharps container.\nIncubate the homogenate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) under gentle rotation (10 RPM) at 4°C to allow cell lysis and extraction of soluble proteins.\nNote: Incubation may vary from 30 min for cell-based samples to 1 h for tissue samples.\nCentrifuge the sample tubes at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Collect the supernatant and transfer it to new sample tubes and label it as Fraction 1 – This is your first sample fraction that is enriched for soluble cellular proteins.\nCritical: Be careful not to disturb the pellet while collecting the supernatant.\nNote: Tubes containing Fraction 1 should be kept on ice while the fractionation is carried out or stored at −80°C until further processing.\nResuspend the pellet in a freshly prepared alkaline detergent buffer by repetitive pipetting.\nNote: As for the Tris-lysis buffer, we recommend using the smallest possible alkaline buffer.\nCritical: If the pellet is not fully resuspended, use a syringe equipped with an 18-gauge needle to shear by passing the partial pellet through the needle.\nIncubate under gentle rotation at 4°C for 30 min to 1 h to allow solubilization and disruption of cell-matrix interactions.\nCritical: Incubate the samples in the alkaline buffer for no longer than 1 h as the NH4OH will damage proteins.\nCentrifuge the sample tubes at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCollect the supernatant and transfer it to new sample tubes and label it as Fraction 2 – This second sample fraction is less concentrated than Fraction 1 and contains cell surface and transmembrane proteins.\nCritical: Be careful not to disturb the pellet while collecting the supernatant.\nNote: Tubes containing Fraction 2 should be kept on ice while the fractionation is carried out or stored at −80°C until further processing.\nNote:  Fraction 1 and Fraction 2 may be combined in a 1:2 (v/v) proportion as a Cellular Fraction or processed separately.",
    "Resuspend the remaining pellet in 50 μL of 1× TEAB/SDS lysis buffer by repetitive pipetting, and label it as Fraction 3 - this is the enriched ECM fraction. It will be a visible pellet in a range of around 50 μL.\nNote: At this stage, the pellet consists of a thick, viscous, transparent mixture of highly insoluble proteins, which may be difficult to resuspend completely into solution through manual homogenization. Proceeding to sonication will aid with dissolving the pellet.\nNote: Collect a desirable volume of Fraction 1 and Fraction 2, or Cellular Fraction, and transfer to new sample tubes, and then add the same volume of 2× TEAB/SDS lysis buffer. The final concentration of SDS will be 5%, which will ensure protein denaturation and inactivation of undesirable protease digestion.\nDay 1: Sample sonication.\nPlace 50 μL of ECM fraction into Covaris AFA glass tubes.\nNote: The user can opt to add 5 mM of dithiothreitol (DTT) to the samples at this stage to improve disulfide reduction later after the sonication step.\nSonicate the ECM sample fraction using a Covaris LE220+ operated through the SonoLab software. Optimize and set the sonication parameters according to sample type. For example:\nFor kidney organoids, set duration = 30 s/sample, peak power = 500 W, duty factor = 20%, 50 cycles/burst, average power = 100 W.\nFor fetal mouse kidneys, set duration = 100 s/sample, peak power = 500 W, duty factor = 40%, 200 cycles/burst, average power = 200 W.\nFor ∗laser-captured or sieved glomeruli, set duration = 60 s/sample, peak power = 500 W, duty factor = 40%, 50 cycles/burst, average power = 200 W.\nNote: Other sonication approaches might also be considered and optimized to yield full disruption of the pellet without physically damaging proteins.",
    "Note: ∗In our study, the laser-captured fetal mouse glomeruli were not processed for matrix enrichment but resuspended in 1× TEAB/SDS lysis buffer and sheared by sonication.\nPlace the sonicated ECM sample fractions on ice.\nNote: You may store the sample fractions in 1× TEAB/SDS lysis buffer at −80°C at this stage or proceed to the protein reduction and alkylation.\nDay 1: Reduction and alkylation.\nPlace 50 μL or 100 μL of sample fraction into clean sample tubes.\nAdd 2.5 μL or 5 μL of 100 mM DTT stock solution to 50 μL or 100 μL of sample fraction, respectively, to a final concentration of 5 mM of DTT, and incubate for 10 min at 60°C using a heating block to reduce proteins.\nLet the samples cool down to 20°C then add 7.5 μL or 15 μL of 100 mM IAM stock solution to 50 μL or 100 μL of sample fraction, respectively, to a final concentration of 15 mM of IAM, and incubate for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark, to alkylate proteins.\nAdd the same amount of DTT as previously to quench the residual alkylation reaction, and vortex mix briefly.\nDay 1: Protein quantitation.\nTo measure protein concentration, use Millipore Direct Detect Assay-free Cards and place 2 μL of (reduced, alkylated) protein lysate in the center of corresponding membrane positions sized spots (and 2 μL of blank, i.e., 1× TEAB/SDS lysis buffer, in the membrane designated as the blank position).\nInsert the card into a Millipore Direct Detect Spectrometer and read the corresponding protein concentration for each sample.",
    "Note: This system requires only 2 μL per analysis to provide accurate measurement of protein lysates. If your sample is highly concentrated, consider diluting it in 1× TEAB/SDS lysis buffer added with 5 mM DTT and 15 mM IAM. Alternatively, other protein quantification approaches such as colorimetric protein assays (Bradford, BCA) can be considered.\nSample processing for label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics\nTiming: 2 h (for step 5)\nTiming: 16 h (for step 6)\nTiming: 1 h (for step 7) (may vary according to the number of samples)\nTiming: 2–4 h (for step 8)\nThis section will detail the procedures for protein clean-up using ProtiFi S-Trap Spin Columns and subsequent protein digestion to peptides with trypsin. At this stage, the sample fractions consist of reduced, alkylated protein lysates in 50 mM TEAB (pH 7.5) containing 5% SDS. If the samples have been stored at −20°C, allow enough time for the samples to thaw at room temperature.\nNote: The steps described next were adapted and optimized from a ProtiFi S-Trap micro spin column digestion protocol (available at: https://files.protifi.com/protocols/s-trap-micro-kit-2-1.pdf[href=https://files.protifi.com/protocols/s-trap-micro-kit-2-1.pdf] ) and a protocol developed by Ronan O’cualain (available at: https://www.protocols.io/view/s-trap-column-digestion-protocol-protifi-of-protei-yxmvmn6q9g3p/v1/[href=https://www.protocols.io/view/s-trap-column-digestion-protocol-protifi-of-protei-yxmvmn6q9g3p/v1/]).\nDay 2: Sample preparation for trypsin digestion in S-Trap Spin Columns.\nNote: Before starting, we recommend processing 25 μL or 50 μL of sample fractions to facilitate calculations for sample washing, cleaning, and digestion.\nNote: The ProtiFi S-Trap micro spin columns are equipped with derivatized silica that traps undigested proteins within its submicron pores, which allows washes to fully remove contaminants and detergents. The micro spin columns are suitable for samples with 1 μg–100 μg of proteins as per the manufacturer’s recommendations.\nNote: For the following steps, we will consider a sample volume of 50 μL, but adjustments can be made to other volumes accordingly.",
    "50 μg of protein is needed as starting material (the volume of sample fraction required can be determined based on previous protein concentration measurements).\nNote: If not 50 μL of protein lysates, make it up to this volume with 1× TEAB/SDS lysis buffer.\nAdd 5 μL of 12% (v/v) phosphoric acid (final concentration will be 1.2% phosphoric acid) and vortex mix briefly.\nNote: This step acidifies the lysate to pH < 1.0, which is critical to denature the proteins and aid the interaction with the resin within the spin columns.\nAdd 330 μL of protein binding/washing buffer and vortex mix briefly.\nPlace the spin columns on top of 2 mL collecting tubes, and add the acidified, methanolic protein lysates into the columns.\nCentrifuge at 4,000 × g for 2 min.\nCritical: Because the spin columns fit approximately 200 μL, sequential loading, and centrifugation rounds will be necessary if your sample volume is > 200 μL until all the lysate has passed through the silica.\nNote: Do not let the liquid that passes through the spin column come in contact with the protein-trapping silica within the column.\nWash the trapped proteins with 150 μL of MTBE/MetOH by simply adding the solution and centrifuging at 4,000 × g for 2 min and discarding the flow-through.\nNote: This wash with MTBE/MetOH will remove lipids that are not removed using methanol only.\nWash with 150 μL of protein binding/washing buffer by simply adding the buffer followed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 2 min, and discard the flow-through. Repeat this wash at least three times.\nNote: Protein denaturation through incubation with protein solvent (SDS), acidification, and multiple exposure to high concentrations of methanol will eliminate any undesired protease activity, hence reducing proteolysis significantly, and maximizing the efficiency of trypsin digestion next.",
    "Day 2: Trypsin digestion.\nMove the spin columns to clean 1.5 mL collecting tubes.\nPrepare 20 μg of Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin (Promega) in 200 μL of digestion buffer.\nNote: This volume will be enough for 20 reactions (consider using no less than 1 μg of the protease of choice per 10 μg of protein/spin column).\nAdd 20 μL of trypsin into the spin columns using a gel loading tip.\nCritical: When adding the trypsin solution, do not touch the trapping silica to avoid contamination. Do not leave air bubbles between the trypsin solution and the trapping silica – the S-Trap binding silica is highly hydrophilic and will absorb the trypsin solution.\nCap the spin columns to limit the evaporative loss and place the columns/collecting tubes on a heating block and incubate at 37°C for 12 h.\nNote: Alternatively, incubate for 1 h at 47°C. Do not shake or move the columns during incubation. Note that some dripping may occur during incubation, but this is not of concern.\nDay 3: Peptide elution.\nAfter the incubation finishes, proteins will have been fully (or partially) digested to tryptic peptides. The next steps will recover the hydrophobic peptides from S-Trap trapping silica. From now on, we will keep and combine each elution after each centrifugation round to yield the peptide samples.\nRemove the spin column and collecting tubes very carefully from the heating block and allow a few minutes for them to cool down to room temperature.\nAdd 65 μL of digestion buffer to the spin columns and centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 2 min and keep the flow-through.\nAdd 65 μL of 0.1% aqueous formic acid and centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 2 min. Combine the flow-through with the first elution.",
    "Add 30 μL of 0.1% formic acid in 30% ACN and centrifuge at 4,000 × g for 2 min. Combine the flow-through with the previous elution.\nNote: The final elution volume is approximately 180 μL, and the final concentration of acetonitrile will be around 5% (v/v).\nThe peptide samples are in an acidic mixture of organic solvents and salts. Proceed to desalt or store the elution at 4°C for 12 h.\nDay 3: Peptide desalting, cleaning, and drying.\nPrepare the OLIGO R3 beads in 50% ACN in a glass vial and let them settle into the bottle of the vial.\nAdd 10 μL of the settled OLIGO R3 beads into the appropriate number of wells of a Corning FiltrEX 96-well filter plate equipped on top of a 96-well collecting plastic plate.\nWash the beads with 200 μL of 50% ACN.\nCentrifuge the plate at 200 × g for 1 min to remove the liquid.\nNote: Discard the liquid containing ACN to an adequate non-chlorinated solvent waste container.\nWash the beads with 200 μL of 0.1% formic acid and centrifuge at 200 × g for 1 min to remove the liquid. Repeat this wash once.\nAdd the peptide samples to the wells containing the beads and incubate on a plate mixer for 5 min at 300 RPM without heating.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 1 min.\nNote: Each well fits approximately 200 μL of liquid, hence, repeat the last two steps if there is an additional sample left to process.\nAdd 200 μL of 0.1% formic acid to the wells containing the beads and peptides and incubate on a plate mixer for 2 min at 300 RPM without heating.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 1 min and discard the flow-through.\nRepeat the wash once.",
    "Replace the 96-well collecting plate with a new plate with unused, clean wells, to elute the peptides.\nAdd 50 μL of 0.1% formic acid in 30% ACN to the wells containing the beads and peptides and incubate on a plate mixer for 2 min at 300 RPM without heating.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 1 min and keep the flow-through.\nRepeat the previous wash, incubation, and centrifugation.\nCombine the flow-through with the first elution – these are your peptide samples.\nTransfer the peptide samples to MS sample vials and label them accordingly.\nNote: The peptide sample volume is approximately 100 μL. We recommend preparing pooled samples for quality control check and to improve the coverage for protein identification in the proteomic runs: for every 10 samples, take 9 μL from each sample and add to another MS vial labeled “pool” – you now will have 10 samples with 91 μL of sample and a pooled sample of 90 μL.\nCompletely dry the peptide samples using vacuum centrifugation.\nNote: Dried peptides are stable and can be kept at refrigerating temperature.\nSample analysis and data acquisition with mass spectrometry\nTiming: 1–2 days (for step 9)\nIn our study, the sample processing immediately prior to the analysis with high-resolution mass spectrometry was performed by the staff of the Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility (University of Manchester). Here we will describe the parameters used specifically for our study but can be adapted to other studies and/or instruments, accordingly.\nDay 4: Sample analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)\nReconstitute the dry peptides in 12 μL of 0.1% formic acid in 3% ACN.\nUse the pooled samples for instrumental quality assessment and sample quality check.\nCalibrate the instrument as per requirement and prepare the setup for LC-MS/MS.",
    "Note: For our study, we used a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a Dionex Corporation UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC nano-system.\nPeptide separation through liquid chromatography is carried out with an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System, using a CSH C18 analytical column operated at 300 nL/min flow rate.\nMobile phase A is 0.1% formic acid in LC-MS water, and mobile phase B is 0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN.\nThe column used is a 75 mm × 250 μm, 1.7 μm CSH C18 column (Waters).\nTransfer 1 μL of peptide sample to a 5 μL loop and load onto the column at a flow of 300 nL/min for 5 min at 5% B.\nUse the following gradient for peptide separation:\n5% B to 7% B from 300 nL/min to 200 nL/min over 1 min.\n7% B to 18% B over 64 min.\n18% B to 27% B over 8 min.\n27% B to 60% B over 1 min.\nWash the column at 60% B for 3 min before re-equilibration to 5% B in 1 min.\nAt 85 min, increase the flow to 300 nL/min until the end of the run at 90 min.\nUse the Q Exactive HF hybrid operated in the HCD mode.\nSet up peptide selection for fragmentation automatically by data-dependent acquisition on a basis of the top 12 peptides with m/z ranging from 300 to 1750 Th, charge state of 2, 3, or 4, with dynamic exclusion set at 15 s.\nSet MS resolution to 120,000, with an AGC target of 36, and a maximum fill time of 20 ms.\nSet MS2 resolution to 30,000, with an AGC target of 25, maximum fill time of 45 ms, isolation window of 1.3 Th, and collision energy of 28.",
    "Note: Parameters on the Q Exactive HF hybrid should be adjusted to different durations of runs.\nNote: ECM fractions were run first, followed by cellular fractions after. Blanks were run in between fractions and time-point for the organoid analysis, to avoid carryover from one sample to another.\nProcessing and bioinformatics analysis of the proteomics data\nTiming: 1 day (for step 10)\nTiming: 1–2 days (for step 11)\nDay 5: Proteome Discoverer analysis of cellular and ECM sample fractions.\nWe used the Thermo Scientific Proteome Discoverer software. The software has default qualitative workflows utilizing Sequest HT for peptide/protein identification, and quantitative workflow for label-free assays.\nNote: More details about the software workflows are available through the user guide (available at: https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/CMD/manuals/Man-XCALI-97808-Proteome-Discoverer-User-ManXCALI97808-EN.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/CMD/manuals/Man-XCALI-97808-Proteome-Discoverer-User-ManXCALI97808-EN.pdf].\nNote: Users can use other search engines and software like Andromeda and MaxQuant, Progenesis and Mascot, or use combined search engines integrated into Proteome Discoverer as we describe later.\nCritical: The cellular and ECM fractions are biologically distinct, i.e., their protein backgrounds are not comparable, and therefore, they should be analyzed separately.\nDownload and save the spectra data (.raw) to a local folder in your computer.\nOpen Proteome Discoverer and create a new study.\nIn the new study definition tab, add and assign adequate study factors corresponding to your assay conditions and replicates (this will impact the way the protein and peptide ratios are calculated by the software; the reader can refer to the software user guide for details about study factors for nested and non-nested assay designs).\nAdd “Individual” factors to assign sample replicate.\nAdd “Categorical” factors to assign experimental group or treatment.\nNote: In our kidney time course study, we defined “Day 14”, “Day 18”, and “Day 25” as categorical factors.\nIn the “Input Files” tab, upload the .raw files for the analysis.",
    "In the “Samples” tab, assign to each .raw file its respective category (group or treatment) and individual (sample replicate).\nNote: In the “Samples” tab, keep all files assigned as “sample” in the “Sample Type” column.\nCreate a “New Analysis” to open the Analysis window and two new tabs: “Workflows” and “Grouping and Quantification”.\nSelect the “Consensus step” in the “Analysis” window, and in the “Workflows” tab, open the “CWF_Comprehensive_Enhanced Annotation_LFQ_and_Precursor_Quan” workflow from the “ConsensusWF” local folder – this is a default workflow for LFQ-proteomics.\nNote: In the “Precursor Ions Quantifier” node, you can opt to change the scaling mode to none, and keep all the default settings for the rest of the workflow tree.\nSelect the “Processing step” in the “Analysis” window, and in the “Workflows” tab, open the “PWF_QE_Precursor_Quan_and_LFQ_SequestHT_Percolator” workflow from the “ProcessingWF_Qexactive” local folder – this is a default workflow for assays analyzed with the Q Exactive HF hybrid mass spectrometer.\n“Select the “Protein FDR Validator” and check the default settings for target FDR (strict = 0.01, relaxed FDR = 0.05). Proteins that pass the strict threshold will be classified and high confidence match whilst those passing the relax (but not the strict) threshold will be classified and medium confidence matches. Low confidence matches should not be considered for further analyses.”\nNote: Proteome Discoverer provides several default workflows for different instruments and analyses, with default settings. Select the adequate workflow accordingly.\nNote: Users are encouraged to use the latest released versions of the target database and additional contaminant database of choice.",
    "In the “Spectrum File RC” and “SequestHT” nodes, set Protein database to Homo sapiens or Mus musculus (SwissProt and TrEMBL databases), Precursor Mass Tolerance = 10 ppm, Fragment Mass Tolerance = 0.02 Da, and Dynamic Modifications = Oxidation / +15.995 Da (K, M, P), and leave the other setting as default.\nCritical: For this study, we used the SwissProt and TrEMBL databases (v.2018_01; OS = Mus musculus for mouse samples; OS = Homo sapiens for kidney organoids).\nNote: Adding oxidation of proline (P) and lysine (K) as dynamic modifications improve the quantification and identification of peptides derived from the collagenous domain of collagen molecules, as these present random hydroxyprolines and hydroxylysines residues at this domain region.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\nNote: By default, Proteome Discoverer uses Sequest HT but other search engine nodes are available and can be integrated into the workflow tree. For each extra search engine node, integrate a new “Percolator” node.\nFrom the “Input Files” tab, select the appropriate files, and drag and drop them into the “Processing step” box.\nIn the “Grouping and Quantification” tab, select the appropriate study variables (i.e., groups or treatment), and for the bulk ratio generator, choose the appropriate group as a denominator for the calculation of protein ratios.\nNote: In our time course study, we calculated “Day 18/Day 14”, “Day 25/Day 14”, and “Day 25/Day 18” ratios.\nLabel-free quantification and identification of extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins\nExport the protein group files from Proteome Discoverer to an Excel file (.xls or .xlsx) and use this for the downstream analysis.\nTo identify extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins, download specie-specific ECM and ECM-associated protein lists from the matrisome project15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] (https://sites.google.com/uic.edu/matrisome/home[href=https://sites.google.com/uic.edu/matrisome/home]) and basement membrane proteins from bmBASE5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] (https://bmbase.manchester.ac.uk/[href=https://bmbase.manchester.ac.uk/]), and cross-reference with your data using gene symbols and/or UniProt identifiers.",
    "Note: matrisomedb16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] and bmBASEdb5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] are online searchable databases that provide lists of individual matrix and basement membrane proteins, respectively, which are classified into different categories: collagens, adhesive glycoproteins, proteoglycans, regulators, matrix-affiliated proteins, secreted factors, cell surface interactors, and others.\nFor the downstream analyses, consider only proteins assigned to a unique “protein group”, quantified and identified by > 1 unique peptide, with a high/medium confidence match score (high: FDR < 1%, medium FDR > 1% and < 5% at protein level; use the same for peptide matches), and observed at least twice in each experimental group/condition.\nTo calculate enrichment level for extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins, first sum the intensity values (abundance) of all proteins in each respective category, then divide by the total sum of protein intensity to obtain the relative abundance of these protein categories per sample.\nNote: Apply the same strategy to calculate the relative abundance of the different matrix and basement membrane protein categories.\nCalculate the median extracellular matrix and basement membrane protein abundance per group and perform statistical comparisons with an ANOVA test.\nNote: In our study, no missing value imputation was done, and the statistical analyses were carried out with Proteome Discoverer through its in-built two-way ANOVA test with post hoc Benjamini-Hochberg correction, with proteins with a p-value < 0.05 being considered as significant.\nNote: If preferred, protein intensities can be log2-transformed prior to the abovementioned calculations to facilitate interpretation and visualization of the data.\nNote: For pairwise comparisons, use a student’s t-test or Welch’s t-test, depending on group size, Gaussian distribution of the data, and variance disparity between groups.\nCalculate fold changes for individual proteins and consider only those passing the statistical test with significant p-values (i.e., < 0.05).",

The reader can find detailed STRING tutorials at https://www.string-db.org/cgi/help/[href=https://www.string-db.org/cgi/help/].\nGo to STRING and search interactions for a list of multiple protein candidates.\nSet a minimum interaction score of > 70% to obtain high-confidence interactions.\nExport the data as a short tabular text output to upload to Cytoscape.\nGenerate and customize a protein interactome using the data from STRING.\nNote: Users can use the stringApp plugin20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] (https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp[href=https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp]) to generate protein interactomes directly with Cytoscape. Network topology parameters can be computed and analyzed with the NetworkAnalyzer plugin21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] (https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/networkanalyzer[href=https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/networkanalyzer])."
