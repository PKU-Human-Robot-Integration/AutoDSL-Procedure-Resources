    "NOTE: An overview of ubiquitylation assay protocol in mammalian cells is represented in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63561/63561fig01.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of the ubiquitylation assay procedure. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63561/63561fig01large.jpg]\n1. Cell culture\nGrow HEK293T cell line in a 100 mm TC-treated culture dish to 80%-90% confluence in growth media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 units), streptomycin (100 µg) and L-glutamine (0.292 mg/mL)). Incubate the culture at 37 °C in a humidified cell culture incubator at 5% CO2.\nTo passage the cells, aspirate the media from the culture dish using a serological pipette. Wash the cells once with 1 mL of sterilized 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 1x).\nDetach the cells by adding 1 mL of trypsin/EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) solution. Incubate the dish at 37 °C for 5 min. Resuspend the cells using a serological pipette in 2 mL of growth media.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a fresh and clean 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT). Remove the supernatant by pouring it out carefully. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL of growth media by pipetting up and down to obtain a homogenous cell suspension.\nTransfer 1 mL of the cell suspension to a 100 mm TC-treated culture dish containing 9 mL of growth media.\n\tNOTE: If the cells are in good conditions, each culture dish of HEK293T, wherein the confluence is 80%-90%, can generate three culture dishes with 80% confluence 2 days after the passage.\n2. Cell transfection\nNOTE: It is not recommended to transfect the cell culture if the confluence reached is less than 80%.",
    "Before transfection, certify if the cells are free from contamination and at an adequate confluence for transient transfections.\nFor each transfection sample, prepare the DNA-Polyethylenimine (PEI 1 µg/µL at pH 7.2) complexes as follows:\n\t\nDilute 3 µg of each plasmid in 100 µL of opti-MEM I reduced serum medium without supplementation and mix it gently by pipetting the solution up and down.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the cells were transfected with 4 µg of each plasmid: Empty vector (pcDNA3) or FLAG-Fbxo7 constructs and UXT-V2-HA, with or without 6xHis-myc-ubiquitin. The total DNA content was 12 µg.\nThaw the PEI at RT and add it into the solution following a proportion of 3 µL of PEI per 1 µg of DNA. Homogenize the solution by pipetting up and down. Then incubate it for 15 min at RT to allow the formation of DNA-PEI complexes.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal proportion of PEI volume per DNA quantity differs according to the cell line selected.\nAdd the total volume of DNA-PEI complexes to each dish containing the cell culture and mix it gently by rocking the plate back and forth. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in a humidified cell culture incubator at 5% CO2.\nReplace the growth medium after 5 h, since prolonged PEI exposure can be toxic to HEK293T cells. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in a humidified cell culture incubator at 5% CO2 for 36 h.\n3. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation\nAfter the incubation period and 6 h prior to cell lysis, treat the transfected cells with 10 µM of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Once again, incubate the cells at 37 °C in a humidified cell culture incubator at 5% CO2.",
    "Aspirate the media from each culture dish using a serological pipette and wash it once with 1 mL of 1x PBS. Detach the cells by adding 1 mL of trypsin and incubating the dish at 37 °C for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of growth media.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a fresh and clean 15 mL tube and centrifuge it at 500 x g for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the supernatant by pouring it out carefully. Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 200 µL of ice-cold NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 225 mM KCl, and 1% NP-40), supplemented with the protease and phosphatase inhibitors cocktail (10 mM NaF and 1 mM Na3VO4), and transfer the solution into a clean 1.5 mL microtube.\nIncubate the cell lysate for 30 min on ice. After incubation, centrifugate the cell lysates at 16,900 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\nMeanwhile, equilibrate the agarose-anti-HA beads with ice-cold NP-40 lysis buffer. Use 15 µL of agarose-anti-HA beads for each sample. Wash the beads with 200 µL of NP-40 lysis buffer by pulsing it in a microcentrifuge tube at 3,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. With a pipette, aspirate and discard the supernatant very carefully; repeat this process three times. Afterward, keep the beads equilibrated on ice until use.\nAfter centrifuging the cell lysates, recover the supernatant. Quantify the protein content in the total lysate using the Bradford method16.\nEnsure that each sample subjected to immunoprecipitation presents an equal amount of protein. Incubate the necessary volume of cell lysate with the equilibrated agarose-anti-HA beads for 4 h, gently rotating in a rotating incubator at 4 °C, which allows the UXT-V2-HA to bind to the agarose-anti-HA beads.",
    "Collect the agarose-anti-HA beads by pulsing them in a microcentrifuge tube at 3,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant. Wash the beads three times with ice-cold NP-40 cell lysis buffer and twice with ice-cold FLAG/HA buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 15 mM MgCl2, 225 mM KCl, and 0.1% NP-40).\nAfter the final wash, remove all the supernatant carefully using a pipette and elute the polyubiquitylated protein with HA peptide (300 µg/mL) diluted on FLAG/HA buffer. Incubate the agarose-anti-HA beads with HA peptide for 1 h at 4 °C in a rocking shaker platform.\nSpin down the beads at 3,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C and carefully pipette the supernatant containing the polyubiquitinated proteins. If necessary, store the eluate in a fresh and clean microtube at -20 °C.\nResolve the eluates and the cell lysates in 10% SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)17 and immunoblotting.\nIn this study, a wet transfer WB was performed. For this kind of transfer, place the gel in a transfer sandwich composed of filter paper-gel-membrane-filter paper, cushion it with pads, and press it together by a support grid. Place this system vertically in a tank filled with transfer buffer and between stainless steel/platinum wire electrodes. The transfer occurs for 90 min at 150 V in wet transfer buffer (glycine 192 mM, tris-base 25 mM, 0.025% SDS, 20% Methanol).\n\tNOTE: Since the cell extracts were quantified (step 3.7), run an SDS-PAGE with an equal quantity of protein for each sample. Also, to resolve the eluate, run equal volumes of each sample.",
    "Probe the immunoblot membrane using selected antibodies 11. Ensure that a smear signal is detected in the eluate from the polyubiquitylated substrate pulled in the IP process by using anti-myc antibody in the samples containing the wild-type E3 ligase, the substrate, and myc-ub. In the cell lysate (input), ensure that the signal from the chosen substrate, the Fbxo7 protein, ubiquitylated proteins, and a housekeeping protein (e.g., GAPDH and β-actin) is detected to guarantee the same quantity of proteins in each lane.\n\tNOTE: The dilution for each antibody used was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nSubscription Required.
