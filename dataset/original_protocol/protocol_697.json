    "**Solutions**\n- GK15 medium: GMEM supplemented with 15% KSR, 1x non-essential amino acid, 1x sodium pyruvate, 1x Glutamine, 1x penicillin/streptomycin and 100µM β-mercaptoethanol\n- αMEM-based IVDi medium: αMEM supplemented with 2% FCS, 150 µM ascorbic acid, 1x Glutamax, 1x penicillin/streptomycin and 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol\n- StemPro-34-based IVDi medium: StemPro-34 SFM supplemented with 10% FCS, 150 µM ascorbic acid, 1x Glutamax, 1x penicillin/streptomycin and 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol\n- Wash medium: DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA fraction V \n- IVG-αMEM medium: αMEM supplemented with 5% FCS, 2% PVP, 150 µM ascorbic acid, 1x Glutamax, 1x penicillin/streptomycin, 100 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 55 µg/ml sodium pyruvate, 0.1IU/ml FSH \\(Follistim), 15 ng/ml BMP15 and 15 ng/ml GDF9\n- Collagenase wash medium: αMEM supplemented with 5% FCS\n- Collagenase solution: Collagenase wash medium with 0.1% Collagenase IV\n- IVM medium: αMEM supplemented with 5% FCS, 25 µg/ml sodium pyruvate, 1x penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 IU/ml FSH, 4 ng/ml EGF, and 1.2 IU/ml hCG \\(Gonadotropin®)\n- Hyaluronidase solution \\(20x): 1% \\(w/vol) dissolved in PBS \n**Making reconstituted Ovaries** \\(rOvaries)\nProduce rOvaries according to the procedure reported previously<sup>6</sup> with slight modifications. \n1. Sort BV-positive PGCLCs differentiated from ESCs or iPSCs by FACSAria II. \n  2. Centrifuge PGCLCs, removed supernatant and resuspend with appropriate volume of GK15 supplemented with 1µM retinoic acid. \n  3. Dissect female gonads from E12.5 embryos and dissociate them by 0.05% trypsin treatment.<sup>6</sup>\n  4. Purify E12.5 female gonadal somatic cells by incubation with SSEA1 and CD31 antibodies conjugated with magnetic beads, followed by magnetic separation through a MACS MS column, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gonadal somatic cells should be in the flow through.    \n  5. Centrifuge gonadal somatic cells, removed supernatants and resuspend with appropriate volume of GK15 supplemented with 1µM retinoic acid.",
    "6. Aggregate 5,000 PGCLCs with 50,000 E12.5 gonadal somatic cells in a low-binding U-bottom 96-well plate in GK15 supplemented with 1 µM retinoic acid. \n  7. Placed in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator and culture for 2 days. \n  \n**IVDi culture** \n8. Set a Transwell-COL on a 6 well plate and soak with αMEM-based IVDi medium. \n  9. Using glass pipette, transfer rOvaries from the 96-well plates on the Transwell-COL. \n  10. Place in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.\n  11. Change the medium at 2 days of culture. \n  12. At 4 days of culture, change a half volume of the medium to StemPro-34-based IVDi medium. \n  13. Change a half volume of the medium to fresh StemPro-34-based IVDi medium every other day. \n  14. Add 500 nM ICI182780 to the StemPro-34-based IVDi medium from 7 days to 10 days of culture.  \n  15. At 21 days of culture, isolate individual follicles from the aggregates. Carefully remove interstitial cells between the follicles by a tungsten needle and then place the isolated follicles on the Transwell-COL. Leave a space between the follicles. During isolation, keep the plate warm on a heat plate. \n  16. After isolating all follicles, place the Transwell-COL on IVG medium in 6-well plate. \n  \n**IVG culture** \n17. After 2 days of culture, add 1ml collagenase solution on the follicles.\n  18. Leave for 10-20 min at 37° C. The time length depends on how much the interstitial cells stick to the follicle. \n  19. Wash 3 times with collagenase wash medium. \n  20. Place the Transwell-COL on IVG medium without BMP15 and GDF9 in 6-well plate, \n  21. Pour gently IVG medium without BMP15 and GDF9 to cover the follicles on the Transwell-COL.  \n  22. Place the plate in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. \n  23. Change a half volume of IVG medium without BMP15 and GDF9 every other day.",
    "24. After 11 days of culture, pick cumulus-oocyte complexes \\(COCs) up by a fine glass capillary and transfer them into 500µl IVM medium covered with Paraffin liquid in a 4 well dish. \n  \n**IVM culture**\n25. Place the 4 well dish in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. \n  26. Culture for 16 hours. \n  27. Add 25µl hyaluronidase solution to the IVM medium, and removed cumulus cells from the oocytes. \n  28. Check first polar body extrusion."
