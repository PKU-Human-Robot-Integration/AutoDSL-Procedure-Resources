    "Juvenile bovine knee joints, obtained from a local abattoir, were used for the present study. Studies with such bovine specimen samples are exempted from Columbia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Designing the friction testing device\nNOTE: A schematic representation of the friction testing device is shown in Figure 1. The device is built on a rigid base plate (not shown), which serves as a platform for structural support.\nAttach a stepper motor to the horizontal translation stage (see Table of Materials), creating a two-axis friction testing device that delivers reciprocal translating motion to contacting surfaces.\nMount a multiaxial load cell on the translation stage (see Table of Materials). The mounted load cell will be used to measure the normal load in the z-direction (Fn), and the tangential load in the x-direction (Ft).\nEquip the translation stage with a linear encoder (see Table of Materials) to record the horizontal displacement (ux) of the stage. Further, equip the loading stage with a linear encoder (see Table of Materials) to record the vertical displacement (uz) of the platen.\n\tNOTE: The translation stage encoder records the relative tangential displacement of the contacting surfaces, and this information is used to detect the beginning of each new cycle of reciprocating sliding.\nConfigure the loading platen (top contacting surface) as a glass, cartilage, or synovium counterface. Connect the platen to the loading stage via a threaded support rod.\nAttach a two-part magnetic base to the top of the load cell (see Table of Materials): (1) a fixed base that is permanently attached to the load cell and (2) a removable base that magnetically connects to the fixed base. Ensure that the two parts form a tight connection.\n\tNOTE: The removable base will hold the translating counterface (bottom contacting surface).",
    "Prescribe a normal load. Use dead weight mounted on linear bearings above the loading platen and support rod. Alternatively, specify a load using the voice coil actuator (see Table of Materials), which can dynamically load the bottom contacting surface41.\nHouse the device within an aluminum-framed acrylic enclosure (see Table of Materials) to protect its environment from contamination.\n\t​NOTE: A custom LabVIEW program controls the device (see Supplementary coding files) with user control of the duration of each test, as well as stage travel path, acceleration (change of direction), and speed. The normal force, tangential force, stage displacement, and creep displacement are monitored throughout the test with data acquisition hardware and software (see Table of Materials).\n2. Specimen preparation and mounting\nPrepare for a sterile tissue harvest following the steps below.\n\tNOTE: If a sterile harvest is not desired, proceed to step 2.2.\n\t\nSterilize metal tools in an autoclave. Spray joint holders with 70% ethanol and place them in the biological safety cabinet (BSC). Close the cabinet for one ultraviolet (UV) cycle.\nRetrieve the tools from the autoclave. Place the tools, betadine, sterile scalpel blades, and beakers containing 70% ethanol in the BSC.\nInside the BSC, open the tools and place them in 70% ethanol beakers. Attach the scalpel blades to scalpel handles.\nPrepare the joint for harvest. Spray the outside of the joint with 70% ethanol and wrap in aluminum foil for 30 min. Take care not to break the joint capsule.\n\t\tNOTE: The juvenile bovine knee joints were received with the femur and tibia cut approximately 15 cm superior and inferior to the joint to ensure an intact capsule.",
    "After 30 min, place the wrapped joint inside the BSC. Open the foil and secure the joint to its holder. Cover the joint in betadine by gently wiping the betadine across the joint surface.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to step 2.2 and step 2.3 for synovium-specific instructions and cartilage-specific instructions, respectively.\nHarvest the juvenile bovine synovium following the steps below.\n\t\nSecure the tibiofemoral joint capsule using a ring stand (see Table of Materials) with the anterior side facing the dissector. Using forceps and a scalpel blade, sever the patellar tendon using a horizontal incision of 5-10 cm (depending on joint size) superior to the tibia (Figure 2A).\nHold the detached patella tendon with forceps. Make two anterior-to-posterior cuts in the shape of a V (Figure 2B,C). These cuts should free the patella.\n\t\tNOTE: As the joint begins to open, be careful not to sever the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and meniscus.\nRotate the patella behind the joint or remove it completely from the joint. Carefully remove the tissue superficial to the synovial membrane on the medial and lateral sides of the joint to expose the synovium.\nUsing a scalpel blade, trace the outline of the synovium region of interest. Using forceps, grasp one end of the synovium and gently lift to stretch the synovium distal to the underlying bone. Use a scalpel blade to remove the synovium from the bone (Figure 2D,E).\nPlace the tissue in appropriate culture media or testing bath solution. The synovium explant may be cultured for a desired experiment or mounted and used for testing.\n\t\tNOTE: Culture media/testing bath solutions may vary based on a research group's preference. For the custom-made ones used for the present study, please see Table of Materials.",
    "Harvest the juvenile bovine cartilage (femoral plugs and tibial strips).\n\t\nSeparate the femur from the tibia by severing the ACL, PCL, MCL, and LCL. Take care not to slice the femoral condyle cartilage or slice through the meniscus to the tibial plateau. Place the separated tissues in their respective holders for dissection (step 2.3.2 for femur and step 2.3.3 for tibia).\nSecure the femur using a ring stand. Using a biopsy punch of desired shape and size, drive the instrument normal to the femoral condyle articular cartilage surface until reaching the bone (Figure 3A).\n\t\t\nLoosen the plug's connection to the bone by moving the punch left to right and forward to backward. Do this without removing the punch.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Crackling sounds may be heard as the bone separates from the cartilage.\nRemove the punch, and therefore the plug, from the underlying bone (Figure 3B). If necessary, repeat steps 2.3.2, 2.3.2.1, and 2.3.2.2 for the remaining untouched locations on the condyle.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In preparation for mounting the femoral plug onto a testing base, the deep side of the plug may need to be shaved flat. This can be done with a box cutter or scalpel.\nPlace tissue in appropriate culture media or testing bath solution. The femoral plug may be cultured for a desired experiment or mounted and used for testing.\nSecure the tibia in an adjustable holder (see Table of Materials). Remove the meniscus carefully while avoiding contact with the cartilage surface (Figure 4A).",
    "On the outer edges of the tibial plateau, use a box cutter to cut perpendicular to the cartilage toward the bone. Cut completely through the cartilage to make straight edges/sides (Figure 4B). Begin the cut approximately 2 mm away from each tibial plateau edge and remove excess tissue. Score the inside edges of the cartilage (Figure 4C).\n\t\t\tNOTE: At this point, the bone needs to be visible underneath the cartilage on the outside edges of the tibial plateau.\nOn the outside edges, use the box cutter to make a clean cut at the interface between the bone and cartilage (Figure 4D).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Cut must be parallel to the cartilage surface and approximately 5 mm inward, deep enough to start separating the cartilage and bone.\nTo remove the tibial strip from the plateau surface, gently insert a flathead screwdriver below the cut made in step 2.3.3.2. Gently rotate the screwdriver to loosen the articular cartilage from the subchondral bone (Figure 4E).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Crackling sounds may be heard as the bone separates from the cartilage.\nAs the sample loosens, slowly push the screwdriver forward until the cartilage strip detaches from the bone. Push the screwdriver toward bone, not toward cartilage. Repeat this process at multiple locations until the tibial plateau articular cartilage is completely removed from the underlying bone (Figure 4F).\nUsing a box cutter, cut the tibial plateau surface to produce rectangular samples of desired size and thickness.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For the present study, 10 mm x 30 mm strips were cut, but this dimension can be varied based on desired experiment and test set-up.\nPlace tissue in appropriate culture media or testing bath solution. The tibial strip may be cultured for a desired experiment or mounted and used for testing.\nIf necessary, repeat steps 2.3.3.1-2.3.3.6 for the second tibial plateau.",
    "Mount the synovium and the cartilage following the steps below.\n\t\nIf desired, select a tibial strip sample to test.\n\t\tNOTE: The strip can be tested as the bottom counterface.\n\t\t\nRemove the removable magnetic base (see Table of Materials) and glue a 60 mm diameter Petri dish to the top surface of the removable base.\nWith the Petri dish glued in place, attach the removable base to the fixed base and mark the Petri dish to indicate a sliding direction.\nApply a small amount of cyanoacrylate (see Table of Materials) to the center of the dish. Align the tibial strip with the sliding direction of the stage (as indicated by the mark on the Petri dish from 2.4.1.2). Gently press the cartilage strip onto the dish. Take carenot to scratch the cartilage surface.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A suction tool (see Table of Materials) can apply gentle pressure to the cartilage without damaging the surface to be friction tested.\nRestore the removable magnetic base (with attached cartilage strip) to its paired magnetic fixed base in the friction tester. Fill the Petri dish with the desired testing bath solution. The testing bath solution must completely cover the cartilage.\nIf desired, select a femoral cartilage plug to test.\n\t\tNOTE: The plug can be tested as the bottom or top counterface.\n\t\t\nIf the femoral condyle is used as the bottom counterface, remove the removable magnetic base and glue a 60 mm diameter Petri dish to the top surface of the removable base.\n\t\t\t\nApply a small amount of cyanoacrylate to the center of the dish. Gently press the cartilage plug onto the dish.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: A suction tool can apply gentle pressure to the cartilage without damaging the surface to be friction tested.",
    "Restore the removable magnetic base (with attached cartilage plug) to its paired magnetic fixed base in the friction tester. Fill the Petri dish with the desired testing bath solution. The testing bath solution must completely cover the cartilage.\nIf the femoral cartilage is used as the top counterface, remove the loading platen and support rod from the friction tester. If necessary, remove the existing platen and select a new platen suitable for cartilage mounting.\n\t\t\t\nApply a small amount of cyanoacrylate to the platen surface. Gently press the cartilage plug onto the platen.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: A suction tool can apply gentle pressure to the cartilage without damaging the surface to be friction tested.\nRestore the loading platen (with attached cartilage plug) and support rod to the friction tester. Adjust the vertical height of the loading platen such that the cartilage plug hovers over the bottom counterface and is submerged in the testing bath. Add more testing bath solution if needed.\nIf desired, select the synovium sample to test.\n\t\tNOTE: The synovium can be tested as the bottom or top counterface.\n\t\t\nIf the synovium is used as the bottom counterface, remove the removable magnetic base and glue a 60 mm diameter Petri dish to the top surface of the removable base.\n\t\t\t\nGlue a custom-machined circular acrylic-silicone post of the desired diameter to the center of the dish.\nUsing forceps, place the synovium on top of the post. To secure the synovium, spread an O-ring (see Table of Materials) over its circumference.\nUsing forceps, gently pull at the synovium to stretch tissue taught and flat beneath the O-ring. Trim excess tissue with surgical scissors.",
    "Restore the removable magnetic base (with synovium attached) to its paired magnetic fixed base in the friction tester. Fill the Petri dish with the desired testing bath solution. The testing bath solution must completely cover the synovium.\nIf the synovium is used as the top counterface, remove the loading platen and support rod from the friction tester. If necessary, remove the existing platen and select a new circular platen suitable for synovium mounting.\n\t\t\t\nUsing forceps, place the synovium on top of the circular platen. To secure the synovium, spread an O-ring over its circumference.\nUsing forceps, gently pull at the synovium to stretch tissue taught and flat beneath the O-ring. Trim excess tissue with surgical scissors.\nRestore the loading platen (with attached synovium) and support rod to the friction tester. Adjust the vertical height of the loading platen such that the synovium hovers over the bottom counterface and is submerged in the testing bath. Add more testing bath solution if needed.\n3. Friction testing\nNOTE: A custom LabVIEW program and associated hardware (see Supplementary coding files) are used for these tests. Please note that the custom code was built on LabVIEW 2010 and has been maintained on this same legacy version. As a result, the code may not be forward-compatible with the most recent version of the software. The following button strikes and user interface references will only be relevant to the custom code. If working with a different software version, a similar custom program can be written by modifying the code.\nInsert the mounted specimens (step 2.4) into the friction tester device.\n\tNOTE: The specimens need to be submerged in the testing bath solution but must not be in contact with one another.",
    "Open the software program and prescribe test parameters: stage speed, stage acceleration, travel path (distance), and test duration (Figure 5).\n\t\nOpen the three windows in the program: Analog Data Build MFDAQ, Initialize Load PID, and Trigger Dynamic Caller.\nRun the Analog Data Build MFDAQ window by pressing the Run (white arrow) button.\nRun the Initialize Load PID window by pressing the Run (white arrow) button.\nNavigate to the Stepper tab in the Trigger Dynamic Caller window. Specify the acceleration, speed, and distance of the translation stage in the user input boxes.\n\t\tNOTE: The distance value sets the wear-track half-length. In other words, the stage will move from the specified zero location (step 3.5) to the set distance value in both the positive and negative x-directions.\nIn the Stepper tab, specify the test duration by selecting the Stepper Time Index file path. Click on the Open folder button at the bottom right of the Time-State table and select the file.\nSpecify the test duration also in the Voice Coil tab. Navigate to the Voice Coil tab in the Trigger Dynamic Caller window. Similar to step 3.2.5, select the Voice Coil Index file path by clicking on the Open folder button at the bottom right of the Time-State table and select the file. The duration must match that of the Stepper tab.\nPrescribe the normal load. If using dead weights, place desired weights on the linear bearings above the loading platen. Ensure that the load applied plus the weight of the loading platen and support rod do not surpass the load cell rated capacity.\nSelect the path and file name for data storage using the open folder button to the right of the Write to File? box. Save the file with a \".txt\" extension.",
    "Center the bottom counterface underneath the top counterface. Set this as the zero x-position.\n\t\nRun the Trigger Dynamic Caller window by pressing the Run (white arrow) button. In the Stepper tab, click on the Home button to move the stage to the last-saved zero x-position.\nIf counterfaces are not aligned, move the stage by clicking on the green left and right arrow buttons. When the desired location is reached, click on the Zero button to save the current stage location as the new zero x-position. Stop the Trigger Dynamic Caller window by clicking on the Stop button.\n\t\tNOTE: The stage location can only be saved while the Trigger Dynamic Caller window is running, but the stage is not yet moving as specified by the program. Pressing the Run (white arrow) button in step 3.5.1 will initiate a 15 s timeframe before the stage begins to move. Use this 15 s timeframe to move the stage and save the desired zero location.\nIf the desired zero x-position is not obtained on the first try, repeat step 3.5.1.\n\t\tNOTE: It may help to hit the Zero button intermittently to save the stage position as the user moves the bottom counterface underneath the top counterface. Recall that clicking the Home button will move the stage to the last position saved by the Zero button.\nOnce the top and bottom counterfaces are centered, initiate friction testing of the samples by starting the cyclic movement of the stage. To do this, run the Trigger Dynamic Caller window by pressing the Run (white arrow) button.\nOnce the stage moves, slowly bring the top counterface into contact with the bottom.\n\tNOTE: The applied load value can be confirmed by viewing the Fz real-time plot in the software window (Figure 5A).",
    "Let the test run, collecting the friction testing data.\n\tNOTE: Any data recorded during step 3.5 will be overwritten. The real-time hysteresis can be viewed in the Trigger Dynamic Caller window (Figure 5C).\nAfter the desired testing duration, stop the test by pressing the Stop button and unloading the specimens by raising the top counterface and moving it out of contact with the bottom counterface.\n4. Data processing\nNOTE: A custom MATLAB program is used for data processing (see Supplementary coding files). The code calls on the output files specified by the custom LabVIEW code.\nUse the custom code to calculate the friction coefficient and the creep displacement (time-dependent tissue deformation) per cycle.\n\t\nEnsure all relevant codes are saved in the same folder: \"frictioncycle_fun.m\", \"frictioncycle_Hysteresis_plot.m\", \"frictioncycle_MU_plot.m\", and \"frictioncycle_run.m\".\n\t\tNOTE: These MATLAB codes were written to be used with the specific outputs from the aforementioned LabVIEW code. If the user has created their own code or has made modifications to the one described here, the MATLAB scripts may need to be edited to accommodate those changes.\nOpen the frictioncycle_run.m file. Click on the Run (green arrow) button in the script. Select the raw data file to be analyzed and the desired MATLAB output save location.\n\t\tNOTE: The software may require a few minutes to process data depending on the test duration.\nIf desired, perform standard tissue assessments and media analyses on the tested explants and aliquots of the testing bath solution.\nSubscription Required.
