    "1. Cleaning of the DIDC sensing chip\nAt the beginning of the experiment, clean the DIDC chip surface26 with piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2in a 3:1 ratio), and place it on the hot plate at 80 °C for 15 min. Next, rinse the sensor surface with distilled water drop by drop using a pipette to remove the cleaning reagents completely. To ensure the complete removal of the reagent, rinse the surface with four to five drops of ethyl alcohol.\n\tNOTE: The DIDC chip was fabricated following a previously published report26.\nThen, dry the sensor surface at room temperature for the complete removal of the reagents to obtain a hydrophilic sensor surface. This chip can be used for further fabrication of the graphene oxide layer on the chip (step 2).\nCover the clean sensor chip electrode pads with polyimide tape.\n2. Fabrication of the thin layer of graphene oxide on the DIDC sensing chip\nPlace the chip on the center of the spin-coating machine in the horizontal position, and add 4 µL of an aqueous solution of commercially available single-layer graphene oxide (GO) (see Table of Materials) onto the chip surface. Then, close the spin-coating chamber, and run for 2 min at 1,300 rpm.\nFor the annealing of the fabricated GO chip, keep the chip on the hot plate horizontally for 40 min at 80 °C.\n3. Cross-linking and functionalization of the GO-glazed DIDC sensing chip\nPerform cross-linking of the N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and NHydroxysuccinimide (NHS) with the thin-film GO chip.\n\t\nAdd 4 µL (0.4 M and 0.1 M, respectively) of EDC-NHS (see Table of Materials) to the thin-film GO chip for generating the covalent conjugation of amine and carboxylic groups via amide bond formation26.\n4. Antibody preparation and immobilization on the chip for protein sensing",
    "For binding the functionalized GO-DIDC chip with the antibody, dissolve commercially available anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs (reproduced by rabbit mAb anti-S1 protein, see Table of Materials) using the dilution buffer (0.01 M PBS containing 0.1% BSA [bovine serum albumin] and 0.86% NaCl).\n\t\nTo 1 µg of purified antibody, add 1 mL of diluted PBS. Then, drop cast 4 µL of the antibody solution onto the cross-linked activated GO-DIDC chip. Leave the chip in the closed chamber for 2 h to bind the Abs onto functionalized chip surface at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The Fab region of the Abs usually consists of abundant reactive amine and carboxylic groups due to its polar nature26; therefore, the subsequent specific immobilization leads to robust covalent \"tail-on\" Ab-specific orientation.\nOnce the antibody immobilization on the sensor surface is done, drop-cast 4 µL of bovine serum albumin (BSA) onto the chip to block the non-specific sites of the immuno-capacitive sensing chip. Place the chip horizontally in the closed chamber for 20 min at room temperature.\nWash the immuno-capacitive sensing chip with DI water, and then continue drying at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: After drying, the DIDC-based capacitive immunosensor (SARS-CoV-2-Ab-EDC-NHS-GrO-Ti/Pt-SiO2-DIDCs) is ready to perform the serial detection of the virus spike antigen.\nFor further sensing of the virus spike protein, prepare different concentrations from 1.0 mg to 1.0 fg to obtain a wide detection limit.\nSubscription Required.
