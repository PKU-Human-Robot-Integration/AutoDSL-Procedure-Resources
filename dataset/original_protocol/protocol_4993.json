Under RNase-free environment, the midguts with foregut and hindgut portion removed (left panel) are digested with Elastase for 1 h. The dissociated tissues are centrifuged, resuspended in DEPC-PBS, filtered, and then sorted through FACS. About 250,000 sorted cells are collected to harvest total RNA, which is then used for library construction and sequencing with Illumina Hiseq-2500 system. The upper right panel shows a confocal image of midgut epithelium with Esg-GFP expression. The bottom right panel highlights the Esg-GFP+ cell population measured by FACS.Isolation of intestinal progenitor cells by FACS (Figure 1)The fly strains carrying Esg-GFP fluorescent markers are used to sort intestinal progenitor cell population (including intestinal stem cells and enteroblasts), midguts from w1118 strain are used to set fluorescence gate. To achieve 250K Esg-GFP+ cells, a minimum of 1,000 midguts is required.Note: It is important to be consistent with age, gender and culture conditions among different biological samples. Here we take expression analysis of Sox21a mutant flies for example. Sox21a mutants carrying Esg-GFP markers served as the mutant sample, with Esg-GFP wild-type flies as WT Ctrl. Based on the observation that overproliferation phenotype is displayed after 10 days in 90% sox21a mutant intestines, we analyzed flies at 10 days old for both the mutants and WT control. For both groups, we chose female flies and cultured them with identical food (standard fly food plus yeast paste). The following steps are performed under RNase-free conditions. Forceps and the dissecting pads are pre-washed with DEPC-PBS solution. The prepared females are ice-anesthetized for dissection. Intestines are dissected and the foregut and hindgut parts are removed by forceps (Figure 2). The midguts are then immediately put in DEPC-PBS (see Recipes) solution on ice. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161214/20161214222921_4289.jpgFigure 2.

    "Use forceps to gently hold a fly and tear the abdomen at the boundary of thorax/abdomen, pull the abdomen away from the anterior part without touching the gut. B and C. Before the gut is fully stretched, cut the gut at the boundaries between foregut and hindgut. Remove the appendix if Malpighian tubule (Mt) or ovarium is attached to the midgut.Incubate 100-200 guts with 1 mg/ml Elastase (see Recipes) in about 1 ml DEPC-PBS per microcentrifuge tube for 1 h at 25 °C until the midguts are largely dissociated. Softly mix the sample every 15 min by pipetting and inverting several times. Dissociated samples are pelleted at 400 x g for 20 min, and resuspended in a microcentrifuge tube with 0.5 ml DEPC-PBS. The suspension was filtered with 40 or 70-μm filters (Corning), by touching pipette tips on the top of the filter so that the cells can go through filters. Wash the tubes and the filters with 0.5 ml DEPC-PBS, and also collect the filtered suspension in the filtered cells. The filtered cells are then sorted using a FACS Aria II sorter (BD Biosciences) and collected in 0.5 ml DEPC-PBS. Note: 40-μm filters are recommended for pure isolation of small diploid cells, such as intestinal progenitor cells or enteroendocrine cells. It’s recommended to double check the sorted cells based on cell morphology and expression of the fluorescent marker.The sorted cells are pelleted at 400 x g for 20 min and preserved in 0.2-0.8 ml RNAiso Plus (Takara Bio) reagents, which can be stored at -80 °C within 6 months until RNA isolation. For each of the biological replicates, at least 200,000 sorted cells are collected to harvest total RNA. For each genotype group, at least 3 biological replicates are prepared.",
    "RNA isolationAdd equal volume of > 95% ethanol directly to the homogenate cell sample. Mix thoroughly by vortexing.Follow the Directzol RNA MiniPrep Kit to harvest total RNA of each sample. DNase I treatment is unnecessary, as polyA RNAs will be selectively purified during cDNA library construction. The RNA sample eluted in DNase/RNase-free water should be used immediately for sequencing library construction or stored at -80 °C for up to 3 months.Library constructionQualify total RNA on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit.
