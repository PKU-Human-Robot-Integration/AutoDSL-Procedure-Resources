The feeder-free maintenance of iPSCs\nTiming: up to 2 weeks\nThis section describes the procedure for thawing, passaging and freezing human iPSCs (hiPSCs). We cultivate hiPSCs using mTeSR plus complete medium on growth factor-reduced Matrigel-coated 6-well plates. Routinely, we passage the cells every 3–4 days using ReLeSR.\nNote: All cell culture procedures are performed under a sterile hood. We utilize WT iPSC clones and HAX1-KO iPSC clones generated by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Because of clonal variations, we suggest at least two clones for each genotype to be included in the assay.\nCell thawing.\nExperimental setup.\nThaw one aliquot of mTeSR plus complete medium (40 mL) at 4°C overnight and prewarm it at room temperature (RT) for at least 30 min before usage.\nDilute 100× Matrigel stock into ice-cold DMEM/F12 medium and quickly dispense the Matrigel dilution into 6-well plates (1 mL/well).\nIncubation 6-well plates with Matrigel solution in a 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for at least 30 min at 37°C.\nNote: Plates can also be coated with Matrigel overnight in 37°C incubator before usage. Additional coated plates can be sealed with parafilm prior to the storage at 4°C for up to 2 weeks.\nFill each 15 mL conical tube with 10 mL plain Advanced DMEM/F12 medium and warm conical tubes with medium in water bath at 37°C for at least 15 min till usage.\nTransfer a frozen vial with 1 million cells from liquid nitrogen on dry ice.\nWash the Matrigel coated 6-well plate with PBS and add mTeSR plus complete medium supplemented with rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor referred as ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) at a final concentration of 10 μM into each well (1.5 mL/well).",
    "Transfer a vial of cryopreserved hiPSCs from dry ice into a 37°C water bath and keep cells into the water bath for 2 min until only a sliver of ice remains.\nUse a 2 mL pipette to remove the contents from the vial and transfer it into a conical tube containing pre-warmed Advanced DMEM/F12 medium (10 mL/tube).\nHarvest hiPSCs by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min at RT.\nAspirate supernatant and gently resuspend cell pellets with 500 μL pre-warmed mTeSR plus complete medium +ROCK inhibitor by pipetting up and down for 5 times.\nDistribute cell suspension onto the prewarmed 6-well plate equally in a drop-wise manner. Carefully, shake plate to further distribute cells evenly.\nNote: Gently resuspend the cell suspension to preserve cell clonal size and structure. Y-27632 acts as a cell-permeable, highly potent and selective inhibitor of ROCK1 and ROCK2 limiting cell death.\nExamine shape and distribution of newly thawed hiPSCs under the microscope and return the 6-well plate back to incubator.\nReplace medium with mTeSR plus complete medium (2 mL/well) the next day.\nReplace medium every second day until single colonies are visible and wells become 70%–80% confluent.\nCell passaging.\nGrow hiPSCs in mTeSR plus complete medium to 70%–80% confluency in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nWash hiPSCs twice with PBS by removing mTeSR plus complete medium and replacing it with 1 mL of PBS per well of a 6-well plate.\nAspirate PBS, add 0.4 mL of ReLeSR per well and incubate for 3–5 min at 37°C.\nNote: Closely monitor cells under the tissue culture microscope until the cells start to dissociate.\nAlternatives: Collagenase IV can be a milder substitute of ReLeSR with longer detachment duration (around 30 min–60 min).",
    "Carefully aspirate the ReLeSR solution, add 1 mL of mTeSR plus complete medium and gently resuspend cells using a 2 mL pipette 2–3 times.\nTransfer cell suspension into a conical tube and harvest cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min at RT.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend cell pellet with 1 mL mTeSR plus complete medium.\nTransfer cell suspension at different ratios (e.g., 1:15 to 1:20) into wells of the Matrigel-coated 6-well plate to a final volume of 1.5 mL.\nNote: Ideally, cells should reach 70%–80% confluence in 3–4 days. Adjust the split ratio to 1:15 to 1:20 to achieve this result, as higher split ratios are associated with more uniform distribution of cells across the well and result in more efficient differentiations into myeloid progenitors.\nNote: Ratios from 1:15 to 1:20 are typically for cell passaging of WT clones, while ratios for KO clones should be optimized based on the cell growth rate of KO cells. For our KO clones, we split cells in the ratio of 1:8 to 1:10 so as to synchronize cell growths between WT and KO before the start of myeloid differentiation.\nCell freezing.\nFollow the procedure 2a-2e.\nAspirate supernatant and use 1 mL of freezing solution (Bambanker) to resuspend the cell pellet of one well of a 6-well plate.\nTransfer each cell solution to a cryovial and place the cryovial(s) in a cell-freezing container.\nPlace the cell-freezing container in a −80°C freezer as fast as possible and the next day store the cryovial(s) in liquid nitrogen.\nNote: Make a clear record of cell passage number, which is of importance for iPSC differentiation.\nPart 2. iPSC differentiation into myeloid progenitors\nTiming: 21 days",
    "We here describe the protocol to generate myeloid progenitor cells from human iPSCs (hiPSCs) by stepwise tuning of cytokines and small chemicals in vitro.\nCritical: Proper maintenance of hiPSCs is critical to efficient neutrophil granulocyte differentiation. Seeding density and colony size must be closely monitored and spontaneous background differentiation must be kept as low as possible. All cell culture steps should be performed in a Class II biosafety cabinet. All solutions should be kept sterile and proper sterile technique should be used throughout.\nNote: We describe a refined protocol from this previous protocol.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nSeeding iPSC colonies for the myeloid progenitor differentiation.\nWash each well of a 6-well plate at a cell confluency of 60%–80% with PBS.\nAspirate PBS and add 1 mL Collagenase IV (1 mg/mL) to one well of a 6-well plate for generation of iPSC cell clumps.\nReturn the 6-well plate into the cell incubator and closely monitor hiPSCs under the tissue culture microscope between the 45 min incubation time.\nNote: The incubation times may vary among different batches of Collagenase IV; therefore, examination of the colonies is needed to determine the appropriate incubation time.\nNote: Passage numbers lower than 40 are optimal and robust for the iPSC differentiation.\nStop the incubation when the edges of the colonies have pulled away from the plate by adding 1 mL of mTeSR plus complete medium.\nCarefully collect iPSC colonies with a 2 mL pipette and transfer cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube.\nHarvest iPSC colonies by centrifugation at 10 × g for 1 min.\nDiscard supernatant and carefully resuspend iPSC colonies with 1 mL mTeSR plus complete medium using a 2 mL pipette.\nNote: Using a 2 mL pipette and limited pipetting times can minimize colony fragmentation.",
    "Drop 10 μL cell suspension on a cell culture dish and carefully examine the size and count the number of iPSC colonies (clumps) within the 10 μL suspension under the microscopy.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2408-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Cell suspension with iPSC colonies (clumps) before iPSC seeding for myeloid differentiation\n(A) 10 μL cell suspension was dropped on a cell culture dish and observed under the light microscope. Scale bar: 1.0 mm.\n(B) Cell colonies/clumps at optimal size (black circles) were taken into account for clump seeding. Scale bar: 1.0 mm.\nCritical: Take the colony clumps whose diameters are between 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm into account, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nSeed 6–10 iPSC colonies into a new Matrigel-coated well of a 6-well plate with 1.5 mL prewarmed mTeSR plus complete medium.\nNote: Because of the frequent random differentiation in KO clones, 10–15 KO colonies are optimal for seeding.\nReplace mTeSR plus complete medium every 2 days until the area of colonies reaches 0.5 × 0.5 mm2 to 1.0 × 1.0 mm2.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2408-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative images showing colonies with optimal sizes before the start of iPSC differentiation\n(A and B) iPSC colonies were grown till the optimal sizes reaching 60%–80% confluences of the vision observed by light microscope with 20× magnification. Scale bar: 200 μm.\nCritical: The optimal area of colonies (0.5 × 0.5 mm2 to 1.0 × 1.0 mm2) is equal to 60%–80% confluency of the vision observed by light microscope with 20× magnification (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The start of differentiation is dependent on the size of the undifferentiated iPSC clone, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].",
    "Note: Typically, 3–4 days after seeding, iPSC colonies have reached the appropriate size and round shape critical for differentiation start. During this time, 6 homogenous iPSC colonies characterized by an appropriate size and round morphology/shape are selected by microscopic examination and labeled with a pen at the bottom of the 6-well plate. Additional iPSC colonies will be carefully removed with a pipet tip. Wash shortly with PBS and add mTeSR plus complete medium. Return 6-well plate to the incubator.\nOn day 0, replace medium with mTeSR differentiation medium (as indicated in the materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) to start myeloid differentiation (2 mL/well).\nOn day 2, replace medium with prewarmed Essential 6 differentiation medium (2 mL/well).\nOn day 4, replace medium with prewarmed StemPro-34 differentiation medium supplemented with SB431542, SCF, bFGF and VEGF (2 mL/well).\nOn day 6, replace StemPro-34 differentiation medium supplemented with SCF, IL-3, Flt-3, VEGF and TPO (2 mL/well).\nOn day 8 to day 17, replace half of the medium with Stempro-34 differentiation medium supplemented with SCF, IL-3, Flt-3 and TPO every 3–4 days (1 mL/well). The scheme of iPSC differentiation into myeloid progenitors is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2408-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Scheme of hiPSC-differentiation into myeloid progenitor cells\nScale bar is 500 μm.\nFor cell counting at day 17, mix 10 μL of cell suspension and 40 μL of 0.1% Trypan blue solution (5×) and pipette 10 μL of the mixture onto a counting chamber slide. Count viable cells under the light microscope.\nNote: Mix the cell suspension thoroughly before taking the counting aliquot to achieve accurate and consistent cell number measurements.\nHarvest floating cells on day 17 for functional assays such as Seahorse of myeloid progenitors. Details are shown in Part 3 session.\nPart 3. Seahorse assay of myeloid progenitors derived from iPSCs\nTiming: 2 days",
    "Here we describe the mitochondrial stress protocol optimized for the full-plate seeding of a single Seahorse XFe96 set. For other Seahorse XF Analyzers (8-well, 24-well) provided by Agilent, the total buffer volumes and total cell numbers require proportionately adjusted. Details can be referred to other seahorse protocols.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nNote: General manufacturer’s instructions for performing a mitochondrial stress test can be found at https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Cell_Mito_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Cell_Mito_Stress_Test_Kit_User_Guide.pdf].\nNote: There are two sets of plates included in the seahorse assay. The set of cell culture microplate is used for seeding cells of interest. The set of utility plate is used for incubating the sensor cartridge with water or calibrant buffer (included in Seahorse FluxPaks). On the top of the sensor cartridge, there are four cavities/ports for drug loading.\nOne day before performing the seahorse assay (on day 16 of iPSC differentiation), prepare the following experimental setup in advance.\nCoat seahorse cell culture microplate with 0.05 mg/mL poly-L-lysine (18 μL/well) for 1 h at RT.\nWash plate with dH2O twice (200 μL/well) and dry cell culture microplate under the hood overnight.\nNote: Make sure there are no bubbles when the cell culture microplate is coated with poly-L-lysine. Alternatively, poly-D-lysine can be used for the plate coating of seahorse assay.\nIncubate the sensor cartridge with dH2O (200 μL/well) in the utility plate and place the cartridge/utility plate in a non-CO2, 37°C incubator for 12–18 h.\nIncubate 20 mL calibrant solution in a non-CO2, 37°C incubator for 12–18 h.\nTransfer aliquoted chemicals and reagents (2.5 M D-Glucose, 200 mM L-Glutamine, 2.5 mM Oligomycin, 2.5 mM FCCP, 2.5 mM Rotenone and 10 mM Antimycin A) from −80°C to 4°C.\nTurn on the seahorse machine one day before the seahorse assay.\nIncubate 30 mL seahorse XF RPMI medium in a 37°C water bath for 1 h prior to step 15.",
    "Discard dH2O and subsequently incubate sensor cartridge with prewarmed calibrant solution in the utility plate and incubate the cartridge/utility plate in a non-CO2, 37°C incubator for at least 30 min.\nReconstitute prewarmed seahorse XF RPMI medium (30 mL) with Glucose (fc. 5 mM) and L-Glutamine (fc. 2 mM) and directly take 2.5 mL reconstituted RPMI medium for chemical dilution of port A, B and C respectively.\nFurther reconstituted the rest 22.5 mL RPMI medium with FBS (1%) and incubate RPMI medium with FBS in a non-CO2, 37°C incubator until usage.\nInjection cavities preparation using reconstituted RPMI medium prepared at step 15.\nBuffer A: Add 15 μL Oligomycin (2.5 mM) into 2.5 mL reconstituted RPMI medium.\nBuffer B: Add 10 μL FCCP (2.5 mM) into 2.5 mL reconstituted RPMI medium.\nBuffer C: Add 5 μL Rotenone (2.5 mM), 1.25 μL Antimycin A (10 mM) and 10 μL Hoechst (20 mM) into 2.5 mL reconstituted RPMI medium.\nNote: Alive cells are stained with Hoechst after the last injection of rotenone and antimycin and quantified by multi-imager Cytation 1 (BioTeK Instruments/Agilent). Details are shown in session “Quantification and statistical analysis”.\nHarvest floating cells from each well of iPSC culture by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min at RT.\nResuspend cell pellets with reconstituted RPMI medium with FBS (1%) prepared at step 16.\nCount cell number in each sample and prepare cell suspension at 100,000 cells per 50 μL.",
    "Critical: To obtain a 90%–100% confluence of cell monolayer in the well of a seahorse cell culture microplate, it is critical to titrate the number of cells based on the cell size of each cell line before the assay. 90,000–100,000 cells are optimal for the cell seeding of iPSC-derived myeloid progenitors in the seahorse assay. For the initial setup assay of other cell lines, recommended cell seeding density per well can be found at “Agilent Life Science Publication Database” (http://www.agilent.com/cell-reference-database[href=http://www.agilent.com/cell-reference-database]). 0.5-fold, 1-fold and 2-fold of recommended cell numbers per well can be seeded as references respectively, in order to define the optimal cell seeding density.\nNote: Addition of FBS (1%) is necessary to ensure the cell viability of suspension cells derived from iPSCs.\nSeed 50 μL well-mixed cell suspension into each well of seahorse cell culture microplate precoated with poly-L-lysine.\nCentrifuge the cell culture microplate at 300 × g for 1 min with 7/9 acceleration and 2/9 deceleration.\nNote: Include at least 4 wells as technical replicates for the seahorse assay of each sample. 4 wells at corners of the plate are normally served as control wells, where 50 μL RPMI medium with 1% FBS instead of cell suspension is loaded.\nAfter the centrifugation, take out the microplate and carefully add 130 μL RPMI medium with 1% FBS into each well using a multichannel pipette.\nPerform the brightfield imaging of all wells of the microplate in Cytation1 machine to get an overview of the cell distribution in each well before performing the seahorse assay.\nAlternatives: The brightfield imaging of all wells of the microplate by Cytation 1 machine is optional. Alternatively, the cell seeding per well can be visually monitored and confirmed by light microscopy.\nDegas the microplate after imaging for 30 min in Cytation1 machine (37°C, without CO2).",
    "Critical: The non-CO2 incubation is important and necessary for the further cell seeding and attachment.\nAfter calibrating the sensor cartridge at step 14, add 20 μL buffer A, 22 μL buffer B and 24.4 μL buffer C into port A, B and C of utility/cartridge plate using a multichannel pipette.\nNote: Since the experimental design requires no injection for port D, each port D is left empty.\nNote: Tips should enter into the port and attach the wall before loading solutions.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Because the bottom of each port is not sealed, thus avoid touching the very bottom of the port during loading. To avoid drug leaking in ports resulting from air pressure, do not add the plate lid to the utility/cartridge plate after drug loading. More details about loading the injection ports can be found at https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/DAY OF LOADING CARTRIDGE XFe96-XF96.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/DAY%20OF%20LOADING%20CARTRIDGE%20XFe96-XF96.pdf].\nNote: The final working concentrations of solution A-C in each well after being injected into cell microplate are 1.5 μM (Oligomycin), 1 μM (FCCP) and 0.5 μM (Antimycin/Rotenone) respectively. For most human cell lines, the concentration ranges of solution A (Oligomycin) and solution C (Antimycin and Rotenone) are normally 0.25–2 μM and 0.5–2 μM respectively. The concentration range of solution B (FCCP) may vary from 1 to 10 μM. Optimal solution concentrations, especially for solution B (FCCP), need be titrated for individual cell type prior to the assay.\nMore details can be found in the Basic Procedures on Agilent Cell Analysis Learning Center and the Cell Line Reference Database at https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay]; http://www.agilent.com/cell-reference-database[href=http://www.agilent.com/cell-reference-database].\nCalibrate the utility/cartridge plate after drug loading in the seahorse machine (preheated at 37°C).\nChoose the program “XF Cell Mito Stress Test” on the Templates window and edit the group information of samples in the option “Plate Map”.",
    "Set parameters of seahorse assay in the option “Protocols” as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2408-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Protocol of Seahorse assay on the Cell Mito Stress Test\nClick “Start Run” at the Run Assay page and save the assay result file in a folder.\nSet the utility/cartridge plate without the lid into the seahorse machine.\nThe calibration process takes around 20 min prior to an automatic degassing procedure.\nSet sensor cartridge calibrated at step 27 onto the cell culture microplate degassed at step 25 and load the complete plate into the seahorse machine and start the assay.\nNote: To avoid the damage of machine, the plate lid must be taken away before the whole plate entering the seahorse analyzer.\nAfter finishing the seahorse assay, perform fluorescent imaging of all wells of the cell culture microplate by Cytation 1 machine for alive cell quantification.\nNote: The cell counts quantified by Cytation 1 machine are used for normalization of seahorse assay.
