    "Preparation and transfection of Caco-2 cellsNote: This technique was used in our recent Developmental Cell article (Michael et al., 2016). Culture Caco-2 cells in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection, plate cells at 200,000 cells/well in a 6-well plate containing 4x coverslips evenly dispersed and lying flat within each well. Once cells reached ~50-80% confluence (~36-48 h post-plating, Figure 1), transfect cells with GFP-NMIIA plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent, according to manufacturer’s instructions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128193406_5306.jpgFigure 1. DIC image of Caco-2 cells after 48 h plating using a 20x objective. The image shows a field of view of 600 x 600 μm.For the transfection, 2 μg of DNA is diluted in 190 μl Opti-MEM containing 5 μl P3000 reagent. In a separate tube, 5 μl of Lipofectamine 3000 is diluted in 190 μl Opti-MEM. Both mixes are then combined and incubated at room temperature for 10 min and applied to cells containing 1 ml Opti-MEM per well. Return cells to the 37 °C incubator and after 6 h, replace the transfection media with growth media. Leave cells to grow within the incubator for a further 24 h before fixation. Expression of the GFP-tagged plasmid can be observed in 30-40% of the cells after 24 h transfection using a fluorescent microscope (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128193514_7807.jpgFigure 2. Low magnification image of Caco-2 cells after 24 h transfection, taken with an epifluorescence microscope. Cells were fixed and stained using Alexa Fluor® 647 phalloidin.ImmunofluorescenceFix cells on ice with 4% PFA for 20 min followed by permeabilization on ice with 0.25% Triton X-100 in TBS for 5 min. Block cells with blocking buffer (see Recipes) at room temperature for 1 h followed by incubation with anti-Myosin IIA antibody (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature.",
    "All antibodies used were diluted in blocking buffer.Wash 3 times with TBS. Then, incubate cells for 1 h with the goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® 546 secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) and phalloidin Alexa Fluor® 647 (1:500 dilution). Wash cells again 3 times with TBS and then mount coverslips by inverting them onto glass slides containing 5 μl drops of ProLong® Gold mounting reagent. Imaging of Myosin IIA and F-actin at the zonula adherensPerform structured illumination microscopy (SIM) of the immunostained coverslips on a Zeiss Elyra superresolution microscope using a 60x objective, 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat oil immersion lens.Do 3-channel imaging, using 488, 561, 640 nm lasers, to detect GFP-NMIIA fluorescence, the NMIIA C-terminal antibody (Alexa Fluor® 546) and phalloidin (Alexa Fluor® 647) at the zonula adherens (ZA).Acquire images of a single z-slice through channel-specific gratings at 5 phases and 3 120° rotations of the grid pattern. Perform image reconstruction with the Zen software using a noise filtering level of -4.5 and an optical sectioning value of 100.Perform channel alignment on reconstructed images using pre-calibrated values that were previously obtained by measuring 4-colour bead alignment samples (multi-speck beads).The final images reveal a pseudo-sarcomeric organization of NMII decorating the phalloidin labeled F-actin filaments at the ZA (Figure 3A). Furthermore, due to the increased resolution of the SIM technique and the N-terminally tagged GFP-NMIIA and C-terminal NMIIA antibody labeling combination, the NMIIA bipolar filaments can be visualized in detail as a set of green-red-green puncta (Figures 3A and 3B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128193808_3934.jpgFigure 3.
