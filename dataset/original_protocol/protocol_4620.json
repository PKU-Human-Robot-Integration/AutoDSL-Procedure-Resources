    "Generation of transgenic nodulesGeneration of pUB:GFP-MtSYP22 or pLB:GFP-MtSYP22 expressing roots by Agrobacterium rhizogenes1-mediated transformation of 7 days old seedlings of M. truncatula. For transformation protocol see Limpens et al. (2004). Plants were grown for 14 days after transformation.Inoculation of composite M. truncatula plants with pUB:GFP-MtSYP22 or pLB:GFP-MtSYP22 transgenic roots with Sinorhizobium meliloti (S. meliloti) 2011 (Sambrook and Russell, 2001). Composite Medicago plants with transgenic roots are transferred to perlite saturated with Färhaeus medium without Ca(NO3)2 (Limpens  et al., 2004). After 2 days, plants are inoculated with 2 ml of the S. meliloti 2011 culture (OD600 nm of 0.1) per plant and grown for 2 weeks (21 °C; 16/8 h light/darkness).Sample preparation for image acquisitionTransgenic nodules (14 days after inoculation) are selected using a fluorescent stereomicroscope with DsRED1 filter settings (Figure 1A-B).Harvested nodules are collected with tweezers in an Eppendorf tube with 500 µl of fixative for 1 h fixation at 4 °C.Fixed nodules are hand-sectioned by razor blades in phosphate buffer (Figure 1C). Try to do sections as thin as possible.Nodule sections are collected by a tweezer in an Eppendorf tube with propidium iodide solution for 10-20 min staining at room temperature.Place nodule sections in a drop of phosphate buffer on a microscopic glass slide. Then place an edge of the cover glass over the sample and carefully lower the cover; make sure there is no air between tissue and glass.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151204/20151204013351_4027.jpgFigure 1.

    "Image acquisitionObserve the nodule section under the confocal microscope using an oil immersion objective lens (x63 or higher) with 488 nm excitation and 505-530 nm emission wavelengths for GFP and with 543 nm excitation and 636 nm emission wavelengths for propidium iodide. Filters: Ch1: LP560, Ch2: BP505-530. Pinhole: 106 μm.Find a group of infected cells at the developmental stage of interest and focus on it.Obtain Z-stack serial images of region of interest. Z-stack size: 512 x 512 x 20-73 pixel. Number of single images in Z-stacks 20-67 depending on the position and size of scanned cells. Using Projection tool you can create a 3D projection image or a rotation in 3D, which can be animated and exported as an AVI movie (Figure 2, Video 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151204/20151204013445_3164.jpgFigure 2. 3D projection of Z-stack serial images of nodule cells expressing GFP-MtSYP22 (green).

Scale bar 40 µm.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. 3D projection of nodule cell Image processing: 3D rendering and volume/area measurements of vacuoles and symbiosomes in infected cells Open Z-stack serial images of the nodule using IMARIS software. Select a region of interest by 3D Crop operation for further manipulations (Figure 3). If an image is too dim to view, adjust brightness of channels individually in the Display Adjustment window.To get rid of out of focus light or other artefacts before measurements, select Smoothing in the Image Processing menu. Select the channels you want to have filtered and filter out noise signal from the 3D image.Generate surfaces of vacuoles and symbiosomes of infected cells in the Surface generation wizard (select the Source Channel for segmentation: for vacuoles pick GFP channel and for symbiosomes RFP channel).",
    "To generate the surface of the whole infected cell, use manual 3D construction mode.Adjust the threshold (the thresholded regions are shown in grey during adjustment).Generated and complete surfaces will be present in the image with changed colours (Figure 3B). You can take measurements from your surfaces by pressing the measure icon (Imaris Measurement). If necessary, adjust the measurement parameters and use filters. Using Movie Maker you can create animations with generated surfaces (Video 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20151204/20151204013515_6896.jpgFigure 3. 3D rendering of the infected cell at the moment of bacteria release in Medicago root nodules.
