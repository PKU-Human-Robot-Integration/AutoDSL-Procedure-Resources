    "The protocol for isolating and identifying the gut commensal E. coli strains from laboratory mouse or rat feces includes the steps for fecal collection, bacterial culture and colony characterization (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180315/20180315190458_2840.jpgFigure 1. Workflow scheme for the isolation and identification of commensal E. coli from mouse or rat feces  Fecal collection Note: Personal protection equipment including gloves and masks are required. Put a healthy NIH Swiss mouse/SD rat into a clean cage and wait for defecation.Use sterile forceps to transfer one fresh fecal pellet into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube preloaded with 1 ml of 1x PBS. Note: Recommended weight of one fresh fecal pellet: mouse, 30-50 mg; rat, 80-100 mg.Put the tubes with fecal pellet on the ice and immediately transfer them back to the lab to perform serial dilution and plating.Serial dilution and plating Note: Wear gloves and use 70% ethanol as a disinfectant for cleaning the surfaces of working bench. Homogenize the fecal pellet thoroughly by vortexing for 30 sec at the maximum speed. Add 900 μl of 1x PBS into four 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes. Perform 1:10 serial dilution from the fecal samples using the wide bore tips.Use the cell spreaders to plate 100 μl of each dilution onto MacConkey agar plate (10-1 to 10-5). Incubate the plates aerobically at 37 °C for 16-18 h.Colony PCR for E. coli identification by Sanger sequencing using 16S rRNA gene primersMacConkey agar is a selective and differential medium for the isolation of coliform organisms. The potential E. coli colonies appear as red and round shaped colonies due to the capability to ferment lactose (Figure 2). Select potential colonies for the following PCR amplification.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180315/20180315190727_7445.jpgFigure 2. Colony morphology of E. coli isolated from rat feces after growth on MacConkey agar. The potential E. coli colonies appear as red with a round shape.",
    "The colonies pointed with black arrows are considered as negative colonies.Add 50 μl of PCR reaction mix (see Recipes) into each PCR tube.Use P10 tips to pick a small amount of the single colony and swirl in the PCR reaction. Mix the colonies and PCR reaction by pipetting up and down, and then discard the tips. Complete the reaction in a thermal cycler following the PCR program (see Notes).Prepare 40 ml of 1% agarose gel by dissolving 0.4 g agarose in 1x TAE and heating (microwave). Add 4 μl of SYBR Safe DNA gel stain into the gel and mix thoroughly. Cast the agarose gel in the apparatus and wait until the gel is solidified. Mix 5 μl of PCR reaction with 1 μl 6x DNA loading dye and apply the samples as well as the marker (2 μl, 1 kb Plus DNA ladder) to the gel. Run the electrophoresis for 30 min at 100 V. Take a picture to check the amplification using a UV transilluminator. Compare the size of the PCR product (about 1,465 bp) to the marker (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180315/20180315190810_0076.jpgFigure 3. Agarose gel electrophoresis image of the 16S rRNA genes amplified from six bacterial isolates. Lane 1 indicates the negative control and the lane 2 to 7 indicate the PCR products amplified the 16S rRNA gene of the selected bacterial isolates. The size of the PCR product is around 1,465 bp.PCR clean-up is performed using a GeneJET gel extraction and DNA cleanup kit following the manufacturer’s instruction. The remaining PCR mix after the gel electrophoresis is used for this step. With the adjusted concentrations, the cleaned-up samples are further sequenced by Sanger sequencing using the 16S rRNA gene primers. The 16S rRNA gene sequences are searched against the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP, released 11.4; http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/[href=http://rdp.cme.msu.",
    "edu/]) and the NCBI nucleotide database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi[href=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi]) (see Data analysis). The isolates that share higher than 98% 16S rRNA sequence identity with the type strain of E. coli are selected and cultured in LB broth (see Recipes) overnight in a shaking incubator (37 °C) to make glycerol stocks (25% glycerol, see Recipes) for preservation.Whole genome sequences and annotationThe selected isolates are cultured overnight in 5 ml LB broth for genomic DNA extraction using a PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s instruction. The LB culture from the last Step C8 can be utilized for DNA extraction. The whole genome sequencing is performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. The isolated genomic DNA is fragmented to generate libraries using a Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The concentrations of generated libraries are quantified by a QubitTM 3.0 fluorometer using a QubitTM 1x dsDNA HS assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The quantified libraries are further normalized to 2 nM and pooled following the protocol of the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit. Denature the pooled libraries using 0.1 N NaOH and mix with 5% PhiX genomic DNA as a positive control.The sequencing of denatured libraries is performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument with 2 x 300 bp reads generated, using a MiSeq reagent V3 sequencing-by-synthesis kit. The draft genome is assembled with the SPAdes assembler (Bankevich et al., 2012). Genome assemblies are evaluated by Quality Assessment Tool for Genome Assemblies (QUAST) (Gurevich et al., 2013). The tool of BBMap (Bushnell, 2014) is used to map the raw reads back to the contigs produced by SPAdes to obtain the information about the coverage for contigs. The algorithm of Megablast (Zhang et al.",
    ", 2000) is applied to blast the contigs against the reference bacterial genomes obtained from NBCI. Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) (Aziz et al., 2008) is used for genome annotation. IslandViewer (Dhillon et al., 2015) is used to predict toxin related virulence in the whole genome of the E. coli isolate. The genomes of the isolates submitted to IslandViewer are in the format of GENBANK. The isolates without identified hits of toxin virulence factor (VF)-related genes in the genome are considered to be commensal E. coli isolates."
