    "1. Growth, expression and harvesting of motor proteins controlled by a galactose induced promoter\nUsing a yeast-peptone-dextrose (YPD) culture plate and a sterile inoculating stick, streak desired frozen yeast strain and incubate for 3-4 days at 30 °C.\nDay 1 of culture growth: In the afternoon, add 10 mL of YP culture media with 2% dextrose to a 1\" diameter glass culture tube and inoculate it with a single colony from the plate. Grow in a rapidly rotating roller drum at 30 °C overnight.\nDay 2: In the afternoon, transfer the 10 mL of culture to a 250 mL flask containing 50 mL of YP culture media with 2% raffinose. Incubate overnight at 30 °C while shaking at 250 rpm on an orbital shaker.\nDay 3: In the afternoon, transfer the 60 mL of culture to a 3 L flask containing 1 L of YP culture media with 2% galactose. Incubate overnight at 30 °C while shaking at 250 rpm on an orbital shaker.\nDay 4: Starting in the mid-morning, monitor the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600 nm every 2 h. When the culture is between an OD 1.5 and 2, continue with the following steps to harvest the cells. Harvesting outside of this OD range may reduce yield due to low cell counts before OD 1.5, or cellular quiescence and protein degradation above OD 2.\nDecant the cell culture into centrifuge bottles and spin at ~6200 x g at 4 °C for 8 min. Pour off the supernatant and discard.\nResuspend the cell pellet in the bottle with double-distilled H2O (ddH2O).\nSpin the cells at ~6200 x g at 4 °C for 8 min. Pour off the supernatant and discard.",
    "Depending on the viscosity of the cell pellet, add up to 2 mL of ddH2O to create a solution fluid enough for pipetting.\nUsing a motorized pipette controller fitted with a 10 mL pipette, slowly dispense the cell slurry into liquid nitrogen one drop at a time. This will produce frozen pellets of yeast cells.\nStore the frozen cells at -80 °C until ready to purify.\n2. Purification of motor proteins from yeast cells\nCell lysis and soluble protein extraction\nPrepare 1 mL of a fresh solution of 0.1 M PMSF in pure ethanol. Wait to add the PMSF to aqueous buffers as it is unstable in water; also, avoid exposure to water until within 20 min (the approximate half-life of PMSF in water) of use.\nPrepare 50 mL of 4x lysis buffer on ice with supplements from the 5x stock of lysis buffer, but do not add PMSF until just before the buffer is applied to the yeast pellet.\nGrind the liquid nitrogen-frozen yeast pellets into a fine powder with a blade-type coffee grinder that has been pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: This protein extraction typically starts with the cell pellet harvested from 2 L of yeast culture. The starting amount of yeast culture can be adjusted up or down with commensurate adjustments to the volumes of IgG beads and DNA oligos in steps 2.2.2 and 2.3.1 below.\nAliquot 15 mL of the 4x lysis buffer with DTT and Mg-ATP on ice and add PMSF to the buffer to achieve a final concentration of 2 mM, completing the preparation of the 4x lysis buffer with supplements.",
    "Collect the yeast powder into a pre-chilled ~100 mL glass beaker on ice. Add a small volume of the 4x lysis buffer with supplements into the powder so that the final concentration of the buffer does not exceed 1x. Typically, add ~1.5 mL of the buffer for every 10 mL of yeast powder.\nQuickly thaw the powder to the liquid phase by placing the beaker in a 37 °C water bath with constant stirring using a spatula.\nPlace the beaker of lysate back on ice immediately after thawing, estimate the lysate volume using a 50 mL conical tube, and add more 4x lysis buffer with supplements so that the final concentration of the buffer is ~1x. Typically, 2 L of yeast culture yields a total of 25-35 mL of lysate containing 1x lysis buffer.\nEvenly distribute the lysate to centrifuge bottles on ice. Carefully balance the bottles to a mass difference no more than 0.01 g between each pair, ensuring that each bottle is above the minimum volume required to prevent bottle collapse. Centrifuge at ~290,000 x g for 25 min at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant containing soluble proteins in a 50 mL conical tube on ice, and discard the pellet containing cell debris and large organelles. Avoid collecting any cloudy portions of the supernatant, as they can clog the gravity-flow column used in subsequent steps. Save 10 µL of the supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis.\nIgG affinity purification\nDuring the spin above, set up a gravity-flow chromatography column on ice or in a cold room.",
    "Transfer 200 µL of 50% IgG affinity bead slurry to the column using a P-1000 pipette tip cut with a razor blade to enlarge the diameter of its entry port. If purifying more or less than 2 L of cell culture pellet, adjust the volume of bead slurry proportionately, with a minimum volume of 100 µL.\nAliquot another 15 mL of the 4x lysis buffer with DTT and Mg-ATP and add PMSF to the buffer to achieve a final concentration of 2mM. Dilute the 4x buffer on ice to 1x by adding ddH2O.\nWash the beads 2x with 5 mL of 1x lysis buffer with supplements.\nResuspend the beads in 200 µL of 1x lysis buffer with supplements.\nAdd the bead suspension to the protein extract obtained from centrifugation and incubate the mixture at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation.\nDuring the incubation, prepare 25 mL of the wash buffer (recipe detailed in Table 1) on ice and 50 mL of 1x TEV buffer (recipe detailed in Table 1) on ice.\nAfter the 1 h incubation, filter the lysate-bead mixture on ice or in the cold room through the same chromatography column used in step 2.2.2 above. Save 10 µL of the flow-through for SDS-PAGE analysis.\nWash the remaining motor-bound beads on ice 2x with 5 mL of wash buffer. Save 10 µL of the first wash for SDS-PAGE analysis.\nWash the beads on ice once with 5 mL of 1x TEV buffer. Allow the buffer to fully drain from the column.\nLabeling with DNA oligonucleotides and TEV cleavage",
    "Remove the chromatography column from the setup and cap the bottom of the column. Within the same column, incubate the motor-beads with 100 µL of 1x TEV buffer containing 10-20 µM of the purified BG-oligo at room temperature (RT) for 10-15 min. If purifying more or less than 2 L of cell culture pellet, adjust the volume of 1x TEV buffer and purified BG-oligos proportionately. Increase the incubation time according to manufacturer's instructions if needed to increase the yield and rate of motor labeling, but be aware that longer incubation times may also increase the proportion of dysfunctional motors due to protein denaturation at RT.\nGently resuspend the beads every minute of the incubation.\nWash the labeled motor-beads 4x with 4 mL of 1x TEV buffer using the same chromatography column and setup as before. Allow the final wash to fully drain from the column.\nCap the bottom of the column, resuspend the motor-beads in no more than 200 µL of 1x TEV Buffer, and transfer to a 2 mL round-bottom microcentrifuge tube.\nIncubate the suspension with ~0.3 units of TEV protease per µL of motor-bead mixture at 16 °C for 1 h with gentle rotations. The tube should be mounted so as to minimize the total surface area of the tube with which the beads come into contact.\nCentrifuge the tube in a microcentrifuge at 21,130 x g for 30 s in a cold room to concentrate the mixture at the bottom of the tube.\nStill in the cold room, use a cut P-1000 pipette tip to transfer the mixture to a spin column and centrifuge at 21,130 x g for 30 s. Collect the filtrate containing the TEV-cleaved, purified motors. The TEV protease will be in the filtrate as well as the motors.",
    "Save 10 µL of the filtrate for SDS-PAGE analysis. Aliquot the remaining filtrate in volumes of 2 µL for TIRF experiments or 50 µL for microtubule affinity purification. Flash freeze the aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.\nResuspend the beads remaining in the filter in 1x TEV buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. Use the same volume of 1x TEV buffer as in step 2.3.4 above.\n3. Microtubule (MT) polymerization\nPreparation of tubulin mixes for TIRF assays\nIn a cold room, separately dissolve the lyophilized tubulin of each type (unlabeled bovine tubulin, biotinylated tubulin, and fluorescent tubulin) in reconstitution buffer (recipe detailed in Table 2) to make a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Let sit on ice for 10 min.\n\t\t\nMix the following components and let sit on ice for 10 min in the cold room (final concentrations are indicated parenthetically): 18 µL of bovine tubulin (~8.2 mg/mL), 2 µL of biotinylated tubulin (~0.9 mg/mL), and 2 µL of fluorescent tubulin (~0.9 mg/mL).\nPrepare 3 µL aliquots of the tubulin mixture and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store the mixtures at -80 °C.\nPreparation of tubulin for MT affinity purification of motors\nIn a cold room, dissolve lyophilized bovine tubulin in the reconstitution buffer to make a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Let sit on ice for 10 min.\nPrepare 3 µL aliquots of the tubulin mixture and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store the mixtures at -80 °C.\nPolymerization of tubulin into MTs\nRemove a 3 µL aliquot of tubulin from the -80 °C freezer and very quickly and briefly thaw to the liquid phase by holding the bottom of the tube. Immediately place on ice and incubate for at least 3 min.",
    "Gently layer 3 µL of 2x polymerization mix (recipe detailed in Table 2) on top of the tubulin solution. Mix by gently flicking the tube, but do not mix by pipetting, as shear forces may disrupt MT nucleation and elongation.\nIncubate the mixture in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min.\nGently layer 6 µL of RT 1x BRB80 with supplements (recipe detailed in Table 2) on top and mix by flicking. Do not mix by pipetting.\nIncubate the mixture at 37 °C for at least 10 min.\nProceed to MT affinity purification, or if doing TIRF assays, incubate MTs in the dark at RT overnight to form longer MTs.\nStore polymerized MTs for weeks in the dark at RT.\n4. Microtubule (MT) affinity purification\nRemoval of unpolymerized tubulins by centrifugation\nMix the following components to make a 60% glycerol cushion: 1x BRB80 (without supplements; recipe detailed in Table 2), 20 µM Taxol (dissolved in DMSO), 1 mM DTT, and 60% glycerol.\nTransfer 60 µL of the glycerol cushion to an ultracentrifuge tube. Gently layer 12 µL of the unlabeled MTs polymerized previously on top of the cushion. To prevent shearing of MTs, transfer them using a cut pipette tip.\nCentrifuge the mixture at ~97,300 x g at 22 °C for 15 min. After the spin, the excess tubulins remain in the top liquid layer, while the MTs form a pellet at the bottom. Mark the outer edge of the tube before the spin to help locate the pellet, as the pellet may not be visible with the naked eye.\nCarefully remove the liquid layer (~12 µL) above the glycerol cushion and save 10 µL for SDS-PAGE analysis.",
    "Gently rinse the interface between the liquid layer and cushion with 20 µL of 1x BRB80 with supplements. Remove and discard the 20 µL rinse.\nCarefully remove the glycerol cushion (~60 µL) and save 10 µL for SDS-PAGE analysis. Be careful not to disturb the MT pellet.\nGently rinse the pellet with 60 µL of 1x BRB80 with supplements (recipe detailed in Table 2). Be careful not to disturb the MT pellet. Discard the rinse solution.\nResuspend the MT pellet in 24 µL of Taxol-supplemented lysis buffer (recipe detailed in Table 3) using a cut pipette tip.\nPurification of functional motors by MT-based affinity chromatography\nRemove two 50 µL aliquots of motors purified from yeast from the -80C freezer and quickly thaw to the liquid phase. Immediately place on ice.\nAdd the following components to a new ultracentrifuge tube in the indicated order and incubate the mixture at RT for 10 min: (1) 100 µL of the motors purified from yeast, (2) 29 µL of 5x ATP/Taxol mix (recipe detailed in Table 3), then (3) 12 µL of purified MTs transferred with a cut pipette tip.\nCentrifuge the mixture at ~97,300 x g and 22 °C for 15 min. After the spin, functional motors remain in the supernatant, and MTs form a pellet, along with the non-functional motors bound to them.\nCollect the supernatant, flash freeze in 2 µL aliquots, and store at -80 °C.\nSave 10 µL of the supernatant for SDS-PAGE analysis. Resuspend the pellet in 141 µL of 1x BRB80 for SDS-PAGE analysis, too. Use protein standards, such as actin, to create a standard curve for quantifying the concentration of the purified motors as previously detailed17.\nUse this concentration information when conjugating motors to the chassis in step 6.1.3.\n5. Production of segmented DNA origami chassis",
    "Formation of chassis\nOrder the staple oligonucleotides listed in previously published tables8 in 96 well plates wet at 250 µM in Tris buffer, or dry and then resuspend them to 250 µM with Tris buffer.\nCreate a pool of the core staples by mixing 5 µL of each core staple (see table S1 in Driller-Colangelo 20168).\nCreate a pool of the linker staples by mixing 5 µL of each linker staple (see linker staple table in Driller-Colangelo 20168).\nCreate a pool of the fluorophore binding staples by mixing 5 µL of each fluorophore handle staple (see fluorophore handle table in Driller-Colangelo 20168).\nMix 50 µL folding reactions with the following components: 1x Folding buffer; 100 nM 8064 scaffold; 600 nM core staple pool; 600 nM fluorophore staple pool; 9 µM fluorophore strand (see fluorophore antihandle table in Driller-Colangelo 20168); for each motor binding site, either 4.2 µM extended handle strands or 600 nM strands without handles as desired (see motor handle/antihandle staples table in Driller-Colangelo 20168); 600 nM linkers as desired8; additional 6 mM MgCl2; and water.\nFold in a thermal cycler using the following program: Rapid heating to 80 °C, cooling in single degree increments to 65 °C over 75 min, then additional cooling in single degree increments to 30 °C over 17.5 h.\nAssay folding quality on a 2% agarose gel in 0.5x TBE buffer (see Table 4 for recipe) supplemented with 11 mM MgCl2 and DNA gel stain (see Table of Materials). Run gel in 0.5x TBE buffer supplemented with 11 mM MgCl2 at 70 V for 60-90 min. Run gels in an ice water bath or in a cold room to prevent excessive heating and subsequent denaturation of chassis structures.\nImage the gel using conditions suitable for the DNA gel stain used in step 5.1.7.",
    "Purification of chassis\nIn the late afternoon the day before purification, create glycerol gradients by gently layering 80 µL each of 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, and 15% glycerol in 1x origami folding buffer in a centrifuge tube (see Table 4 for recipe). Boundaries between layers should be slightly visible.\nIncubate gradients at 4 °C overnight.\nThe next morning, add 45% glycerol in 1x origami folding buffer to the folded chassis solution to a final concentration of 10% glycerol.

Run gels in an ice water bath or in a cold room to prevent excessive heating and subsequent denaturation of chassis structures.\nImage the gel using conditions suitable for the DNA gel stain used in step 5.2.6.\nSelect fractions for future experiments that exhibit well-folded monomeric structures free of unincorporated staples.\nQuantified concentrations of selected fractions using appropriate spectroscopic methods, such as UV absorption at 260 nm. Use this concentration information when conjugating motors to the chassis in step 6.1.3.\n6. Making slide assay chambers",
    "Make a slide assay chamber by sticking two strips of double-sided tape to a glass slide and placing a coverslip on top. The chamber is the narrow space sandwiched between the coverslip and glass slide, flanked by the two strips of tape. Figure 1 illustrates the assay chamber.\nWhen preparing the slide with solutions, use a pipette to flow any fluid into the chamber from one side, and use a strip of filter paper to collect the flow of the fluid on the other side.\n7. Motor-ensemble motility TIRF assay\nConjugation of motors to DNA chassis\nOn ice, prepare fresh 1 mL each of DTT-supplemented BRB80, Taxol-supplemented lysis buffer, and casein-Taxol-supplemented lysis buffer (recipes detailed in Table 5). Transfer 200 µL of each buffer to a RT tube.\nStill on ice, use the cold casein-Taxol-supplemented lysis buffer to prepare the 4x energy and 4x scavenger mixes (recipes detailed in Table 5).\nIncubate 10 µL of ~300 nM purified motors with 5 µL of ~10 nM DNA chassis on ice for 15-30 min. These concentrations of motors have been shown to saturate the chassis' motor binding sites for this incubation time.\n\t\tNOTE: motor occupancy is not 100%, likely due to stochastically missing handle staples in individual chassis structures8,28.\nDuring the incubation, dilute the biotin- and fluorophore-labeled MTs 100x with the RT Taxol-supplemented lysis buffer, and prepare a gel filtration resin appropriate for size exclusion column chromatography by following the procedure outlined below.\nRemoval of excess motors from motor-chassis conjugates by size exclusion column chromatography",
    "In a 50 mL conical tube, wash 5 mL of the gel filtration resin 2x with 45 mL of ddH2O. For each wash, mix the resin with water in the conical tube, and spin the mixture at 460 x g for 1 min. Discard the supernatant and save the resin.\nWash the resin 2x with 45 mL of 1x lysis buffer (recipe detailed in Table 5) using the same method described above.\nResuspend the washed resin in 1x lysis buffer in a 1:1 ratio, so that the resin becomes a ~50% slurry in buffer. The washed resin can be stored at 4 °C for at least 1 month.\nTransfer 800 µL of the resin suspension to a spin column. Drain the excess buffer by gravity flow for 5 min. Remove any remaining buffer with a 2 s spin at 1,000 x g. The final resin volume should be around 350-400 µL.\nDilute the motor-chassis mix with the casein-Taxol-supplemented lysis buffer to a final volume of 50 µL. Transfer the diluted mix to the spin column packed with resin.\nCentrifuge the spin column at 1,000 x g for 6 s (this time is inclusive of the acceleration and deceleration time).

Incubate for 2 min to allow binding between the biotin on MTs and streptavidin.\nWash 2x with 20 µL of the RT casein-Taxol-supplemented lysis buffer. Incubate for 2 min to allow casein to permeate the entire chamber.\nDilute the purified motor-chassis conjugates 5x to 10x to single-molecule conditions (~10-100 pM) with the cold casein-Taxol-supplemented lysis buffer. Mix together the following components to produce a final motor-chassis mixture: 10 µL of the motor-chassis dilution, 5 µL of 4x energy mix, and 5 µL of 4x scavenger mix.\nFlow in 20 µL of the final motor-chassis mixture to the assay slide chamber and proceed to TIRF microscopy.\nImaging and data acquisition\nImage the slide immediately with a TIRF microscope. Typically, each slide remains useable for between 30 and 60 min.\nAcquire a still image in the MT channel, and a movie in the chassis channel. For the motors in this protocol, 10 min movies with a frame rate of 0.5 fps and exposure time of 200 ms are appropriate.\nFrom the chassis movie, generate one kymograph for each MT in ImageJ or a similar image processing software29. Analyze the velocities and run lengths of motor-chassis ensembles by measuring the slopes and horizontal distances of the runs on the kymograph30.\nSubscription Required.
