    "1. Fabrication of a wafer mold by soft lithography\nNOTE: Mask pattern data is available in our previous publication14.\nDehydrate a 4-inch silicon wafer in a 120 °C oven for 15 min.\nSpin coat 4 g of SU-8 2 negative photoresist onto a 4-inch silicon wafer at 1,000 rpm for 30 s to create a 5 µm thick layer (layer #1).\nSoft bake layer #1 on a 65 °C hotplate for 1 min and then transfer layer #1 to a 95 °C hotplate for 3 min.\nCool layer #1 to room temperature, place it onto the holder of the semi-automatic mask aligner, and align with the layer #1 chrome-plated photomask (capture-site layer).\nExpose layer #1 with 365 nm UV light at a dose of 150 mJ/cm2.\nRemove layer #1 from the aligner and post-bake on a 65 °C hotplate for 1 min. Transfer layer #1 to a 95 °C hotplate for 1 min.\nCool layer #1 to room temperature. Immerse in a propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate solution to wash away the uncrosslinked photoresist for 2 min. Gently dry with nitrogen gas to reveal a layer #1 alignment mark.\nCover the layer #1 alignment mark by an adhesive tape, spin coat 4 g of SU-8 10 negative photoresist onto the layer #1 at 1,230 rpm for 30 s to create a 25 µm thick layer #2.\nRemove the tape, soft bake layer #2 on a 65 °C hotplate for 3 min, and then transfer layer #2 to a 95 °C hotplate for 7 min.\nCool layer #2 to room temperature, place layer #2 onto the holder of the semi-automatic mask aligner, and align the layer #2 chrome-plated photomask (bypass channel layer) to the layer #1 alignment mark.",
    "Expose layer #2 with 365 nm UV light at a dose of 200 mJ/cm2.\nRemove layer #2 from the aligner and post-bake on a 65 °C hotplate for 1 min and transfer layer #2 to a 95 °C hotplate for 3 min.\nCool layer #2 to room temperature, and cover the layer #1 alignment mark by adhesive tape. Spin coat 4 g of SU-8 2050 negative photoresist onto layer #2 at 1,630 rpm for 30 s to create a 100 µm thick layer #3.\nRemove the tape, soft bake layer #3 on a 65 °C hotplate for 5 min, and then transfer layer #3 to a 95 °C hotplate for 20 min.\nCool layer #3 to room temperature, place layer #3 onto the holder of the semi-automatic mask aligner, and align the layer #3 chrome-plated photomask (culture chamber layer) to the layer #1 alignment mark.\nExpose layer #3 with 365 nm UV light at a dose of 240 mJ/cm2.\nRemove layer #3 from the aligner and post-bake on a 65 °C hotplate for 5 min. Transfer layer #3 to a 95 °C hotplate for 10 min.\nCool layer #3 to room temperature. Immerse in a propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate solution to washed away the uncrosslinked photoresist for 10 min, and gently dry with nitrogen gas.\n2. PDMS device preparation for multiple single cell capture\nPlace the wafer mold and the weighing dish containing 100 µL of trichlorosilane in a desiccator (only for silanization) and apply a vacuum (-85 kPa) for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: Silanize the wafer surface with trichlorosilane to create hydrophobic surface properties before PDMS castingso that it can effortlessly be peeled off from the wafer PDMS mold.",
    "Stop the vacuum, and then silanize the wafer mold in the desiccator (only for silanization) at 37 °C for at least 1 h.\nMix PDMS base and PDMS curing agent in a ratio of 10:1. Pour a total of 20 g of mixed PDMS onto the wafer mold in a 15 cm dish.\nPlace the 15 cm dish into a desiccator and apply vacuum (-85 kPa) for 1.5 min. Then remove the 15 cm dish from the desiccator. Keep for 20 min at room temperature. Finally, remove residual air bubbles in PDMS with nitrogen gas.\nPlace the 15 cm dish in an oven at 65 °C for 2-4 h to cure PDMS.\nRemove the PDMS replica from the wafer mold, and then punch a 1.5 mm inlet and a 0.5 mm outlet on the PDMS using a 1.5 mm inner diameter and a 0.5 mm inner diameter puncher (Figure 1C).\nClean the PDMS replica and the slide surface with removable tape and then treat the surface with oxygen plasma (100 W for 14 s).\nManually align the PDMS replicas with the slide and bring them into contact with each other.\nPlace the PDMS slide in a 65 °C oven for 1 day.\n\tNOTE: Permanent bonding between the slide and the PDMS replica is achieved to form the device.\nImmerse the PDMS device in a container filled with phosphate buffered saline and place into a desiccator. Then apply vacuum (-85 kPa) for 15 min to remove air bubbles.\nPlace the PDMS device in a cell culture hood and sterilize the device with UV light (light wavelength: 254 nm) for 30 min.",
    "Replace the PDMS device buffer with medium (DMEM-F12 basal medium containing 1% antibiotic and 10% fetal bovine serum) and incubate the PDMS device at 4 °C for 1 day. This prevents cells from adhering to the PDMS surface.\n3. Preparation of a single-cell suspension\nNOTE: Cell types include human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), human OSCC TW2.6 cells expressing WNT5B-specific shRNA (WNT5B sh4) and vector control (pLKO-GFP) which were obtained from our previous study15. Please refer to our previous publication for detailed cultivation steps.\nRemove the culture medium when the cells achieve 70-80% confluence. Then gently wash the cells with 5 mL of sterile PBS three times.\nAdd 1 mL of DMEM-F12 medium containing 1 µM fluorescent dye into WNT5B sh4 and pLKO-GFP cells (use MV2 medium for LECs) and then incubate the cells for 30 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: LECs were stained with green chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) Dye, WNT5B sh4 cells were stained with blue 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (CMAC) Dye and pLKO-GFP cells were stained with red Dil fluorescent dye.\nGently wash the cells with 5 mL of sterile PBS three times.\nRemove the PBS and add 2 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for LECs).\nIncubate the cells for 4 min at room temperature and then gently tap the tissue culture dish to promote cells detachment.\nAdd 4 mL of DMEM-F12 medium to disperse WNT5B sh4 and pLKO-GFP cells (For LECs use 3 mL of MV2 medium and 1 mL of trypsin neutralizer solution). Then transfer the cells into a 15 mL tube, and centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of DMEM-F12 medium gently. Count the number of live cells in a hemocytometer by using the standard Trypan Blue exclusion method16. Prepare 1 mL of cell suspension at 3 x 105 cells/mL concentration in DMEM-F12 medium, and then keep cells on ice to prevent cell aggregation.\n\tNOTE: In order to improve single-cell capture efficiency, careful preparation of the single cell suspension with well-dissociated is required.\n4. Multiple single-cell capture and triple single-cell culture\nConnect a poly-tetrafluoroethene (PTFE) tube between the outlet of the device and syringe pump. Remove the medium and add 1 µL of cell suspension at a concentration of 3 x 105 cells/mL into the inlet of the PDMS device.\nLoad the cell suspension into the device by a syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.3 µL/min (Figure 2A). Flow direction is from the inlet to the outlet.\n\tNOTE: Load immediately after adding the cell suspension into the inlet to prevent cell sedimentation.\nAdd 1 µL of DMEM-F12 medium into the inlet of the PDMS device after step 4.2.Load the DMEM-F12 medium into the device by a syringe pump at a flow rate of 0.3 µL/min (Figure 2B). Flow direction was flowing from the inlet to the outlet.\nLoad 0.3 µL of DMEM-F12 medium into the device by a syringe pump at a flow rate of 10 µL/min (Figure 2C). Flow direction was flowing from the outlet to the inlet.\nRepeat steps 4.1 to 4.4 to load other cell types into the device.\nAfter completing the cell capture, use a microscope with 4x lens to image each culture chamber.\n\tNOTE: The fluorescence emissions of the cells was used to identify and count the number of individual cells in each culture chamber.",
    "Remove the PTFE tube and seal the inlet and the outlet with polyolefin tape to create a closed culture system.\nMove the PDMS device to a 10 cm culture dish and add 10 mL of sterile PBS around the PDMS device to avoid evaporation of the medium from the device.\nTransfer the culture dish to an incubator (37 ° C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidity) for triple single-cell culture.\nMicroscopically observe and photograph cell growth every 12 h.\nSubscription Required.
