    "Development of the MSPT and initial application was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. MS patients and HCs signed approved Informed Consent Documents prior to testing MSPT.\n1. General Aspects of Method Development\nThe tablet used for this protocol is the Apple iPad, a powerful computing device with high quality inertial sensors embedded within the device. These various sensors packaged in a compact, affordable device provide an ideal platform for multi-sensor test administration.\nFor measuring rotation rates, utilize an embedded 3-axis gyrometer with a range of ±250 degrees per sec at a resolution of 8.75 millidegrees per sec at a maximum sampling rate of 100 Hz. Use a 3-axis linear accelerometer with a range of ±2.0 g at a resolution of 0.9-1.1 mg at a sampling rate of 100 Hz to capture linear acceleration.\nEnsure the device also has a high-resolution capacitive multi-point touch screen in which X and Y position data are sampled at 60 Hz while recognizing up to 11 separate contact points simultaneously.\nWrite the MSPT app in Objective-C, a general purpose high level object-oriented programming language that is used in Apple's Mac OS X and iOS operating systems.\nNOTE: Using this approach to software development allows an advantageous use of future advances in hardware while keeping collected data consistent. The program has been previously written and validated by a team of engineers through Xcode, an Objective-C compiler.\n2. Design and Testing of the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test (MSPT)",
    "Prepare the MSPT on the iPad to include five performance modules as follows: 1) Walking Speed, designed to simulate the WST; 2) Balance Test; 3) Manual Dexterity Test (MDT) for upper extremity function, designed to simulate the 9HPT; 4) Processing Speed Test (PST), designed to simulate the SDMT; and 5) Low contrast letter acuity test (LCLA), designed to simulate standard Sloan LCLA charts12 (Table 1).\nWalking Speed Test (WST)\n\t\nThis test is based on the WST, which is part of the traditional MSFC.\nPlace the tablet on the subject’s lower back at sacral level (Figure 1).\nRecommend that the subject use any usual assistive device (e.g., cane, walker, brace) for walking. Ask the subject to ensure the tablet volume is turned up for this test and the tablet is facing outwards on the belt and positioned on their back.\nHave the patient stand just behind the start line. Instruct the patient that they should begin walking when the technician hits the start button and issues the command to start.\nPress the start button and observe the patient as they walk the 25 ft to the finish line as quickly and safely as possible. Ensure that the patient does not slow down until after passing the finish line. When they pass the finish line, hit the tablet stop button.\nSample and collect data from the tablet to quantify the time required to complete the WST.\nBalance Test\n\tThis test is designed to provide objective clinical data regarding the integration of sensory information in maintaining postural stability.\n\t\nAffix the tablet to the subject’s lower back at approximately sacral level (Figure 1).\nAsk the subject to ensure the volume is turned up for these tests. Inform them that the test consists of two 30 sec trials.",
    "For the first trial, have the subject stand with their hands positioned on their hips, keep both feet together and balance. Instruct the subject that if they move out of the stance, regain balance, and get back into testing position as quickly as possible.\nObserve the subject as they balance for 30 sec and record any of the following errors: Hands off hips; opening at eyes; step or stumble; lifting toe or heel off ground; staying out of position for more than 5 sec; bending at the waist.\nFor the second trial, repeat steps 2.2.2.1 and 2.2.2.2 and have the subject keep their eyes closed.\nUse the data obtained to quantify movement of the subject’s center of gravity throughout the two trials as a measure of postural stability. Utilize a MATLAB script to determine center of gravity movement through computer analysis of the inertial data.\n\t\tTraditionally, an error counting system is employed to assess balance performance, but this measure is dependent on evaluator judgment, and is plagued by inter- and intra-rater reliability issues.\nManual Dexterity Test (Figure 2)\n\tThe MDT is designed to quantify manual dexterity during the performance of an upper extremity task by simulating the 9HPT. The module has two variations in terms of initial peg position. In the first variation, called the “dish” version, the 9 pegs originate in a shallow dish with the same dimensions as the standard  9HPT apparatus. The pegs are inserted into the 9 holes, then returned to the dish exactly as with the 9HPT. The alternative test, called the row version, starts with the pegs inserted in a home row located 7.1 cm from the middle of the center insertion holes. Pegs are removed from the row, inserted into the holes, then moved to the dish to complete the test.",
    "MDT Dish test.\n\t\t\nPlace the pegs in the starting dish.\nInstruct the patient to perform the peg task as quickly as possible. Inform them that if a peg falls onto the table they retrieve it and continue with the task but if a peg falls on the floor, they should keep working on the task and the technician will retrieve it.\nHave the participant picks up the pegs one at a time, using only one hand, and put them into the holes in any order until the holes are filled. Note: the non-dominant hand can be used to steady the peg board.\nThen, without pausing, have the participant remove the pegs one at a time, return them to the container, and touch the tablet screen upon task completion.\nObserve the participant repeat this task two times with each hand, starting with the dominant hand.\nMDT Row test.\n\t\t\nPlace the pegs in the starting home row positions, 7.1 cm from the middle of the center insertion holes.\nPerform this test by following steps 2.3.1.2 to 2.3.1.5.\nUse the capacitive touch screen of the tablet to determine the exact time of insertion and removal of each pin. Determine the total time to complete one cycle of insertion and removal of all 9 pegs for each version of the test.\nThe Low Contrast Letter Acuity Test (LCLAT)\n\tThe LCLAT is based on standard Sloan LCLA charts12. For the iPad version (Figure 3), contrast levels of 10% and 5% are shown, in addition to the 2.5% and 1.25% gradient levels used for traditional technician-administered testing.\n\t\nHave the participant sit. Hold or mount the tablet 5 ft away from them at eye level. Dim the lights or re-position the patient to minimize any glare.",
    "For each trial, ask the participant to identify five letters displayed in a row on the screen. Observe as the participant attempts to identify the letters in order from left to right. Score the trial based on the number of letters correctly identified out of the five presented. Continue trials with smaller letters and determine the smallest letter size identifiable by the participant.\nDetermine the number of letters correct at each contrast gradient level using the MSPT app, and compare with the performance on the Standard Sloan LCLA charts.\nThe Processing Speed Test (PST) (Figure 4)\n\tThe PST is similar to the SDMT, which has been recommended as a replacement for the PASAT in the MSFC. The SDMT is a reliable and valid tool for assessing information processing speed14.\n\t\nPrepare and test the patient as follows (using directions provided through the tablet):\n\t\t\nShow the patient a sample testing screen containing a symbol key (two lines of boxes at the top of the screen) and the test portion of the screen (two lines of boxes in the middle of the screen.\nExplain that, in the key, boxes in the top row contain symbols and boxes in the lower row contain corresponding numbers. Explain that in the test, the upper boxes display symbols, the lower boxes are empty and the task is to input the numbers corresponding to the symbols\nObserve the patient practicing the test. Initiate the practice round by pressing the “begin practice” button. Observe the patient select the appropriate numbers by lightly touching the keyboard at the bottom of the screen with only the index or pointing finger of their dominant hand.",
    "Inform the patient that, in the test, when they complete a row, a new row of symbols will appear. Instruct the patient to continue selecting numbers until told to stop and to move on from incorrect answers which cannot be changed. Ask the patient to complete the test as quickly and accurately as possible.\nBegin the test by pressing the “begin test” button. Observe the patient perform the test for 2 min. Determine the number of correct responses.\n3. Validation\nConduct a prospectively defined validation study to assess performance characteristics of the MSPT compared with traditional technician-based testing. Use this data to determine test-retest reliability, relationship to EDSS, disease stage, disease duration, patient-reported outcomes, and relationship to technician-administered neurological and neuropsychological testing.\n\tThe study presented here was conducted at a single site - The Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research at the Cleveland Clinic. 51 MS patients representing a range of neurological disability and disease duration, and 49 age and gender matched HC were recruited for a single study visit. The inclusion criteria were as follows: healthy controls willing to participate in MSPT validation or a diagnosis of MS by International Panel Criteria16, ages 18-65, able to understand the purpose for the study and provide informed consent; ambulatory and able to walk 25 ft, with or without ambulation assistive device.\nUtilize the following comparisons for validation:\n\t\nCompare the WST from the MSPT with the WST measured by a trained technician.\nCompare the MDT from the MSPT with the 9HPT measured by a trained technician.\nCompare the LCLAT test from the MSPT with the Sloan LCLA measured by a trained technician.\nCompare the PST from the MSPT with the SDMT measured by a trained technician.",
    "Compare the balance Test from the MSPT with balance testing by a trained technician using the Tetrax balance platform.\n\t\tValidation results are provided for all testing except Balance Test, which will be reported elsewhere.\nDefine the relationship between technician or MSPT testing and patient reported outcomes as correlations with the MS Performance Scales (MSPS)17,18. Additionally, collect Neuro-QOL PRO measures19 and work status (results to be reported elsewhere). The MSPS are validated patient reports of mobility, hand dexterity, vision, fatigue, cognition, bladder function, sensory function, spasticity, pain, depression, and tremor."
