    "This protocol follows the guidelines of our institution's human research ethics committee.\nNOTE: For the implementation of this protocol, a General Electric (GE) Vivid E95 or Philips Epiq 7C ultrasound system is used. On the GE Vivid E95 system, the user has a choice between the 4Vc-D (adult probe) or 6Vc-D (pediatric probe). On the Philips Epiq 7C, the user has a choice between the X5-1 (adult probe) or X7-2 (pediatric probe). See Figure 1.\n1. Patient setup and probe selection\nPosition the patient in a left lateral decubitus position when possible. See Figure 1, step A.\nSelect the appropriate 3D matrix probe, pediatric or adult, based on the patient size and imaging window quality. In the majority of pediatric patients under the age of ten, a high frequency (pediatric) probe can be used when imaging from a parasternal imaging window due to the close proximity of the mitral valve. Over the age of ten, use of a pediatric probe can be attempted, however with excellent image quality on older children, the adult probe is more ideal. See Figure 1, step B.\n\t​NOTE: If the user only has access to an adult 3D matrix probe, for smaller pediatric patients, increase the scanning frequency for optimal spatial resolution.\n2. Probe positioning and 2D image optimization\nApply a generous amount of gel to the selected 3D matrix probe.\n\tNOTE: The optimal imaging window for 3D mitral assessment is a modified low parasternal long axis view. From this view, the mitral valve apparatus is in close proximity to the probe and the mitral valve leaflets to be relatively perpendicular to the ultrasound beam. In addition, a low parasternal long axis view provides full visualization of the entire mitral valve apparatus. See Figure 1, step C.",
    "To obtain a modified low parasternal long axis view, position the probe on the chest in a standard parasternal long axis echocardiography view.\n\t\nSlide the probe laterally on the chest until the mitral valve leaflets are more perpendicular to the ultrasound beam and the 2D imaging window is optimal (this position will be between the standard parasternal window and standard apical window).\n\t\t​NOTE: If the patient does not have an optimal modified low parasternal view, a standard parasternal window and apical window in combination will allow full visualization of the mitral valve anatomy.\nCenter the mitral valve in the ultrasound sector by rocking the probe. Rocking the probe involves motion in the long axis of the probe along a fixed point while changing the angle of insonation away from 90 degrees. In 3D imaging, center the area of interest in the ultrasound sector to allow for a narrower volume and therefore better temporal resolution.\n3. 3D Volume acquisition method\nBegin by activating the 3D button on the ultrasound console (may also be labelled 4D by some vendors) to enter a full volume display. The full volume display should begin as a real-time full volume.\n\tNOTE: 3D Zoom can also be used to obtain a 3D data set of the mitral valve, however with its limited region of interest, would not be recommended because including surrounding structures can be important for surgical management.",
    "If the patient is cooperative and able to hold their breath, use ECG gated full volume acquisition (see Figure 1, step E). Choose the number of sub volumes (heart beats) to use for the acquisition; on most ultrasound systems the number of sub volumes can be set between 2-6 (see Figure 1, step H). The higher number of sub volumes used during acquisition will result in a higher volume rate (increased temporal resolution) but can result in stitch artifacts related to breathing or motion as the sub volumes are put together.\nIf the patient is uncooperative or unable to hold their breath, real-time 3D full volume acquisition will eliminate the potential for \"stitch\" artifacts (see Figure 1, step F). However, the reduced temporal resolution is not ideal in children and will require the user to either sacrifice volume size (region of interest) or spatial resolution to compensate (both discussed in the next step).\n4. 3D volume optimization (see Figure 1, step G)\nOptimize the full volume size to include all the mitral valve annulus, chordae, papillary muscles and aortic valve where possible.\n\tNOTE: With ECG gated acquisition, a larger volume of data can be acquired because of an increase in volume rate achieved via sub volumes.\n\t\nA smaller volume of data will be required for real-time acquisition, in order to maintain a reasonable frame rate. Do this by narrowing the elevation plane and imaging in a parasternal short axis to allow for full visualization of the mitral valve leaflets and annulus (see Figure 2).",
    "Optimize 3D signal-to-noise ratio (quality of the images) by increasing the ultrasound line density when possible. An increase in ultrasound line density will result in a decrease in volume rate. Different vendors have variable terminology for this function. On the GE Vivid E95 ultrasound system, optimize the line density using the Frame Rate knob. On the Philips Epiq 7C ultrasound system, optimize the line density using the Image Quality touch screen button.\n\t\nWith ECG gated acquisition, increase the 3D volume line density because the use of sub volumes will maintain a good volume rate.\nWith real time acquisition, balance the 3D volume line density with an acceptable volume rate for the patient's heart rate.\nSet the 3D gain settings higher than 2D gain settings to minimize drop-out in the mitral valve leaflets. Gain can be decreased during post-processing to further optimize the cropped image if needed.\n5. Storing the 3D full volume acquisition (see Figure 1, step I)\nIf using ECG gated acquisition, ask the patient to hold their breath and remain still. Then activate the number of sub volumes (heart beats) selected. Wait at least the number of beats selected before pressing Store (the more sub volumes that are selected will result in a longer storing process)\n\t\nEnsure there are no \"stitch\" artifacts present and the entire mitral valve is visible in the 3D volume before storing the final volume.\nIf using real time acquisition, store the final volume once all optimization is complete.\n6. 3D color Doppler acquisition\nSeparately obtain a color Doppler 3D volume acquisition by adding color Doppler and following steps 3-5 of the protocol. Optimize the color Doppler box size as narrow as possible while including the entire mitral valve annulus. Set the color Doppler velocity scale between 60-80 cm/s.",
    "Use ECG gated acquisition to maintain an adequate volume rate. Follow step 5.1 to store the 3D color Doppler volume.\n\t​NOTE: The addition of color Doppler to a 3D volume significantly reduces temporal resolution, making its feasibility in children difficult.\n7. Post processing and cropping of the mitral valve\nNOTE: Post processing and cropping of the mitral valve can be performed directly on the ultrasound system for immediate results. However, there is also dedicated GE software (EchoPAC) and Philips software (QLAB) that provide the same functions from a reviewing station. In addition, TomTec provides a universal software for post processing and cropping 3D datasets from both vendors.\nLoad the stored 3D volume of the mitral valve in a 3-panel multi-planar display (2D lateral plane, 2D elevation plane, and 3D reconstruction) and activate the quick cropping tool. The quick cropping tool requires two clicks and allows the user to crop in any plane.\n\tNOTE: Different vendors will have variable terminology for the quick cropping tool. On the GE Vivid E95 ultrasound system, this cropping tool is labelled \"2 Click Crop\". On the Philips Epiq 7C ultrasound system, this cropping tool is labelled \"Quick Vue\".\nTo obtain an en face view of the mitral valve viewing from the left atrium (Surgeon's view) follow the below steps (see Figure 3, step E).",
    "Working from the 2D lateral plane (low parasternal long axis in this protocol), position the first curser within the left atrium, just above the mitral annulus. After the first position is set, drag the curser across the mitral valve towards the ventricular side and align the crop line parallel to the mitral valve annulus. Position the second curser within the left ventricle, ensuring the mitral valve leaflets are captured within your crop lines, and set this point (see Figure 3 step B).\nThe recommended display orientation for the mitral valve en face is anterior up12. Using the trackball, rotate the 3D mitral valve to position the aortic valve at the top of the screen.\nTo obtain an en face view of the mitral valve viewing from the left ventricle, simply flip the previous step cropped image 180 degrees (on some vendor systems there is a flip crop function that accomplishes this quickly) (see Figure 3, step F).\n\t\nCrop the color Doppler 3D volume of the mitral valve in the same orientation as step 7.3.\nObtain a view of the mitral valve sub-valvar apparatus including the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles.\n\t\nWorking from the 2D lateral plane (low parasternal long axis in this protocol), position the first curser in the middle of the left ventricle. After the first position is set, drag the curser towards the posterior wall of the left ventricle and align the crop lines parallel with the long axis of the left ventricle. Position the second curser below the posterior wall and set this point (see Figure 4).\nOptimize the 3D gain and compression settings.\n\t\nOptimize the 3D gain settings to its lowest setting while maintaining minimal to no mitral valve leaflet drop-out.",
    "Optimize 3D compression settings to include a wider or narrower range of color shades. 3D compression can improve 3D depth perception. On the Philips Epiq 7 system, adjusting the 3D compression is performed by rotating the Compression knob. On the GE Vivid E95 system, adjusting the 3D compression is performed by rotating the Active Mode gain knob.\nStore the optimized, cropped 3D views of the mitral valve as separate cine loop clips.\nSubscription Required.
