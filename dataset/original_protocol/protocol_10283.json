    "1. Silicon Microwell-array Fabrication\nParylene coating\nDeposit between 1-1.5 µm of parylene N on silicon wafers using a commercially available parylene coating system according to the manufacturer's specifications and instructions (settings: vaporizer set point = 160 °C; furnace set point = 650 °C).\n\t\tNOTE: Approximately 6 g of parylene N loaded into a chamber yields coatings 1-1.5 µm thick.\nPhotolithography\nSpin-coat the parylene N-coated wafers with adhesion promoter, 20% hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS), and 80%propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) (see the Table of Materials) at 3,000 rpm for 45 s. Fill a 2 mL transfer pipette with adhesion promoter and sprinkle it over the entire wafer. Allow the wafer to sit for approximately 10 s before spinning it dry.\nFill a 2 mL transfer pipette with positive-tone photoresist (see the Table of Materials) and dispense the photoresist in the center of the wafer. Spin at 3,000 rpm for 45 s to yield a resist coating that is approximately 1.5 µm thick.\nSoft-bake the samples on a hotplate at 115 °C for 1 min.\nUse a contact aligner and photomask with the desired well pattern to expose the sample to ultraviolet light. Expose the spin-coated wafer through the patterned photomask for 6 s, giving an approximate dose of 60-80 mJ/cm2 measured at 365 nm.\nDevelop the pattern by submerging the sample in developer (< 3% tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide in water; see the Table of Materials) for 2 min. Rinse with DI water and dry with clean, dry nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: The areas of photoresist exposed to UV should be cleared during development.\nReactive ion etching\nUse an oxygen plasma etch to remove the exposed parylene all the way to the silicon substrate.",
    "NOTE: The recipe can be modulated to alter the etch rate of the parylene. For parylene thicknesses between 1 and 5 µm, use a recipe with 60 mTorr, 20 °C, 100 sccm O2, 10 W RF, and 2,000 W ICP on a Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) tool. After etching and removing the exposed parylene layer, the patterned area (i.e. the exposed silicon) should look shiny and silver.\nUse a deep RIE (DRIE; e.g., Bosch DRIE) etch process to etch into the silicon.\n\t\tNOTE: The etch rate and duration will determine the well depth. One full cycle of the Bosch process (a 3 s deposition step: 20 mTorr, 15 °C, 140 sccm C4 F8, 10 W RF, and 1,750 W ICP followed by a 10 s etch process: 20 mTorr, 15 °C, 120 sccm SF6, 8 W RF, and 1,750 W ICP) corresponds to approximately 1 µm of etch depth. The wells used in this demonstration range from 3 - 3.5 µm deep.\nVerify the etch depth using physical profilometry.\n\t\t\nLoad the sample into a physical profilometer (see the Table of Materials).\nTurn on the sample vacuum and press the manual load button.\nFocus the system onto the sample by pressing the \"Focus\" button. Position an appropriate feature for measurement on the view screen.\nScan the sample. Level the profile and measure the feature depth.\nRecord the etch rate and modulate subsequent etch times to achieve the desired depth.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The measurements will include the depth of the silicon well, the thickness of deposited parylene, and the thickness of the photoresist. Verifying the thickness of each layer throughout the procedure is necessary to achieve accurate well depth.\n2. Bacterial Culture and Seeding (Figure 1a)",
    "Start colonies on Luria Broth (LB) agar plates from glycerol stocks and use within two weeks. Pick colonies of the desired strains from LB agar plates and start overnight cultures of P. aeruginosa. Incubate the overnight cultures for approximately 18 h at 37 °C while shaking at 220 rpm in R2A medium.\n\tNOTE: Colonies should be picked within two weeks of plating to ensure that the mutations and fluorescent reporter genes are retained. All P. aeruginosa work should be done under BSL-2 conditions.\nUse a diamond scribe to section the silicon wafer into individual chips containing the ensembles of different sizes and pitch-well arrays. Ensure that each chip contains the full complement of well sizes and pitches for the study.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55701/55701fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Fabrication and Cell Seeding Procedure. (a) Microwell arrays are etched into silicon wafers coated with a thin layer of parylene (i). To wet the wells and/or functionalize the surface, a protein solution is added in a droplet on top of the arrays (ii). The protein solution is removed, the wafers are dried, and a new solution containing the desired bacteria is added (iii). The bacterial solution is removed after an incubation period, and the wafers are allowed to dry, leaving behind bacteria in the wells and on the surface (iv). The surface-associated bacteria are removed with parylene lift-off, leaving behind bacteria seeded cleanly in the microwells and still viable due to the 2% glycerol medium, which helps to keep the wells hydrated(v). The silicon chips are then placed array-side down on an agarose gel-coated glass coverslip, which feeds bacterial growth in the microwells (vi). (b) Layout of sub-arrays on a single silicon device. Each sub-array contains a set of identical wells. The diameter of the microwells across all sub-arrays range in diameter from 5-100 µm and are organized at 2x, 3x, or 4x the well diameter pitch, which is denoted by the white to dark-gray colors on the bottom panel schematic. When the well depths are shallow (<10 µm), the 5 and 10 µm well diameters are rarely useful, generally because of a lack of cells colonizing these very small wells. In this work, only the data from wells with 15-100 µm diameters were analyzed. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55701/55701fig1large.jpg]\nNOTE: As shown in Figure 1b, a complete chip contains sub-arrays of wells, with diameters ranging from 5 to 100 µm, with three different pitches (i.e. 2x, 3x, and 4x the diameter) repeating 4 times.",
    "Place a 150 µL droplet of 500 µg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS solution on top of the array to wet the microwells. Incubate the BSA solution for 1 h on the chip at RT in a humid chamber.\nCreate the chamber by filling the bottom of an empty pipette tip box with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS).\n\t\tNOTE: Other substances, such as specific lectins, can be used in place of BSA to functionalize the surface of the microwells.\nWhile incubating silicon chips with BSA solution, centrifuge the cultures at 2,500 rpm (corresponding to an average of 950 x g) for 5 min and then resuspend them in 500 µL of fresh R2A medium with 2% glycerol.\nDetermine the OD of the culture using a UV-vis spectrometer at 600 nm. Adjust it to an OD of 0.02 using 2% glycerol R2A medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The glycerol helps to prevent the wells from drying out during parylene lift-off.\nAfter incubation, remove the BSA solution and rinse 3x with PBS by removing and replacing the liquid droplet covering the silicon microwell array. Dry under nitrogen.\nAdd 150 µL of 0.02 OD cultures to each of the dry arrays placed in a humid chamber. Incubate for 1 h at 4 °C to allow the bacteria to adhere to the well walls.\n\tNOTE: Refrigeration is not required for incubation. The 4 °C incubation time can be used to prevent the growth of bacteria before imaging begins so that one can visualize the spatial organization of the communities prior to growth. Room-temperature incubation can also be used. Both protocols result in similar growth curves.\n3. Microscope Set-up",
    "Prior to starting the bacterial incubation on the silicon chips, turn on the stage-top environmental control chamber (see the table of materials) and adjust the settings on the control box so that the humidity (~100%) and temperature (30-32 °C, see step 3.2) can equilibrate prior to adding samples.\nLevel the sample holder and line the interior around the sample with PBS-soaked lab wipes (see the Table of Materials) to increase the humidity in the chamber to dew point. Set the temperature of the chamber to 30 °C and that of the chamber lid to 32 °C to reduce condensation on the imaging plane.\n\tNOTE: The slide holder fits into the live-cell chamber with a gasket that is approximately 1 cm thick. The sample holder is leveled with the assistance of a bubble level that is placed on top of the sample holder. The sample holder can be tilted slightly and remain sealed in the gasket to level.\nWhile cultures are incubating on the silicon chips, manually turn on the power switch for the mercury lamp at least 30 min prior to imaging. Manually turn on the camera and automated microscope stage. Open the software used to control the microscope and peripheral equipment and ensure that the equipment is recognized by the software.\n\tNOTE: Magnification is 10X with NA = 0.3.\n4. Preparation of Agarose-coated Glass Coverslips\nMicrowave previously prepared agarose solutions (i.e. 2% agarose in R2A medium) until a liquid state is reached, approximately 60 s.",
    "Wet the back of a 75 mm x 22 mm, #1.5 glass coverslip with ethanol and place it lengthwise, centered, across a 2 x 3\" (50 x 75 mm) glass slide. Place two PDMS spacers (thickness of ~1 mm) along the long edges of the coverslip and shift the glass coverslip so that roughly 1 mm of the coverslip is overhanging the edge of the slide.\nPour 5 mL of liquid agarose solution on top of the glass coverslip, just enough to completely cover it, and place a second 2 x 3\" glass slide on top of the assembly to \"sandwich\" the liquid agar between the coverslip and slide.\n\tNOTE: This controls the depth of agarose, making the total thickness of the coverslip and hardened agarose equal in thickness to the PDMS spacers.\nAllow the glass slide-coverslip-agarose gel-glass slide sandwich to set until the agarose solution begins to solidify; then, transfer it to a refrigerator. After 15 min, remove the excess solid agarose and cut around the glass coverslip. Move this to a clean dish and place it in a refrigerator until use.\n5. Sealing the Wells with an Agarose-coated Coverslip and Imaging\nAfter the bacteria incubation period is complete, remove the agarose-coated coverslip from the refrigerator and prepare the silicon chips, as follows.\nDip the silicon chips in ultrapure water, one at a time, for 10 s each. Set them on their edges on a lab wipe or tissue until most of the excess liquid has drained from the edges of the chips.\nCut a piece of tape to match the edge length of each silicon chip. Place the tape on the parylene that is covering the silicon and use it to quickly peel away the parylene coating.",
    "Immediately invert each peeled chip and place each chip such that the microwell-array side faces (and makes contact with) the agarose-coated side of an agarose-coated coverslip. Take care not to move or shift the chip after it touches the agarose to prevent the growth of bacteria outside of the wells.\nPlace the assembled microwell array/agarose coverslip in the slide holder of the stage-top environmental control chamber on the miscroscope.\nUse ambient light or directed light (e.g., a flashlight) to locate arrays of interest. Use the commercial software controlling the automated stage to save those positions (see the table of materials). Turn off ambient or directed light after the positions are stored.\nIn the commercial software, open the \"ND Acquisition\" panel.\n\t\tNOTE: This panel includes a menu for automatic saving to a specific directory, as well as programmable image acquisition. For these experiments, the \"Time,\" \"XY,\" and \"λ\" menus are used.\nTo save the locations in the software, click on the \"XY menu\" and then check an empty box on the left-hand side for each position that needs to be saved. Also, click on the \"Include Z\" button.\nAcquire images over time at the desired wavelengths and 10 magnification using the appropriate fluorescence filter cubes (see the Table of Materials).\nUse the control software and saved array positions to move to each saved location and to focus on the wells. Click on each XY location in the saved list and adjust the focus using the Green Flourescence Protein (GFP) filter. Save the new z-position by clicking the arrow pointing at the z-location.\n\t\tNOTE: This process can be time-consuming. Consider taking the precaution of increasing the gain and using the neutral density filter to reduce the light intensity to prevent photobleaching.",
    "Determine the z-axis distance between focal planes for each wavelength by noting the difference in the z-axis position when focused on the surface of the array. Choose 2-3 locations from the array with the mixed red/green bacteria population and focus using the Red Fluorescence Protein (RFP) filter.\n\t\t\nSubtract the distance between the focal planes using the GFP and RFP fluorescence filters and add that focal plane adjustment under the \"λ\" menu.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For example, if the array appears focused in the GFP channel at a z-location of 50 µm, and the same array appears focused in the RFP channel at 55 µm, add +5 next to the RFP optical configuration in the \"λ\" menu.\nBegin time-lapse image acquisition.\n\t\tNOTE: For the experiments shown here, RFP and GFP images were acquired for every array position at 30 min intervals using multi-dimension image acquisition through a commercial software that controls the camera, shutter, filter wheel, and motorized stage.\n\t\t\nSet the \"interval\" to 30 min and the \"duration of the experiment\" to 24 h under the \"Time\" menu. Click \"Run Now.\"\n\t\t\tNOTE: With the \"Time,\" \"XY,\" and \"λ\" boxes checked, running the program will move the stage to image each location (i.e. the saved XYZ locations), take an image in one wavelength, move the z-position to account for focal plane differences (i.e., lambda or wavelength control), take the second image, move on to the next array location (multipoint), and loop this at 30 min intervals (time-lapse).\nAcquire illumination control images.\n\tNOTE: Use the \"ND Acquisition,\" \"Time,\" and \"XY\" menus to take images of 4 locations, 25x each.",
    "Take a series of 100 \"darkfield\" images by turning off all light sources and taking an \"image\" of a standard slide. These images will capture camera noise. Use the longest exposure time used during the timelapse (step 5.3.3).\nTake a series of 100 \"illumination field\" images by imaging a standard slide (i.e. uniform RFP or GFP intensity) at a few different locations to capture the uneven illumination at the given experimental conditions. Choose an exposure time that maximizes the signal without reaching saturation.\n6. Analysis\nProcess the image stacks using an image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ).\nConvert the acquired images to tiff file format using the commercial software. Upload images into the image analysis software by clicking \"File\"> \"Import\"> \"Image Sequence.\"\nCreate a \"Correction Image\" by averaging all \"darkfield\" and \"illumination field\" images. Subtract the average \"darkfield\" image from the average \"illumination field\" image by choosing \"Process\" > \"Image Calculator.\" Select the two images, \"Image1\" and \"Image2,\" and then \"Subtract\" in the \"Operation\" field. Click \"OK.\"\n\t\t\nFor averaging, load the correction (or darkfield) images, click \"Image\" > \"Stacks\" > \"Z Project\" > \"Average Projection.\"\nPerform image registration if necessary. Then, perform background subtraction by clicking \"Process\" > \"Subtract Background.\" Enter a radius (e.g., 125) in the \"radius\" field and select \"sliding paraboloid.\"\nPerform illumination correction using \"Process\" > \"Calculator Plus.\" Choose the following parameters: operation, divide; i1, well image; i2, correction image; k1, correction image mean; and k2, 0. Click \"Create New Window.\"",
    "NOTE: This data set did not require registration, but in other work, the ImageJ Plugin StackReg was used with the \"Translation\" transformation. For the background subtraction, use the same sliding paraboloid radius for every image set. For example, if the largest wells imaged have a pixel radius of 100, use a radius larger than 100 (e.g., 125) for every image set.\nDetermine the growth of each strain in the microwells.\nSelect regions of interest (ROIs) around each microwell in the desired arrays using the ImageJ \"MicroArray\" plugin.\n\t\t\nIn the \"MAP\" menu, click \"Reset Grid.\" Specify rows, columns, and diameter (based on the well size and number on the array; see Figure 1b). Select \"circle\" from the \"ROI shape\" menu.\nHold the \"Alt\" key while selecting the top-left ROI with the mouse to move the ROI array. Hold the \"shift\" key while selecting the bottom-left ROI to change the size of the array. Hold the \"shift\" key while selecting an ROI from the right side of the array, but not at the corners, to change the spacing of the ROIs.\nUse the above commands to fit the ROI array over the wells in an image. Click \"Measure RT.\"\n\t\t\tNOTE: The plugin will export the desired measurements from each ROI. Use three ROI sizes, creating concentric rings around the wells to collect local the background signal (i.e., the signal from the middle ring subtracted from the outer ring) and fluorescence measurements (i.e., the signal from the inner ring).\nCollect the data in a spreadsheet software and calculate the background signal. Import it to a custom scripting software for further analysis.\nData organization and analysis",
    "Import the data and organize the data collected in ImageJ into a matrix in the following order for all times: column 1, sub-array number; column 2, well row; column 3, well column; column 4, mean intensity; column 5, background intensity; and column 6, mean intensity - background intensity.\n\t\t\nSeparate the results of the mCherry and GFP acquisition into different matrices. Store the results from each sub-array and each color in a different cell in a cell array.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This organization makes it simpler to move back and forth between image data and measurement results, cleaning the data and ensuring that the measurements accurately represent the data.\nAdjust for the autofluorescence of P. aeruginosa.\n\t\tNOTE: In experiments involving the co-culture of GFP and mCherry strains, an mCherry-only chip should be analyzed to ascertain the relationship between mCherry and green autofluorescence.\n\t\t\nPlot the mCherry-versus-GFP signal from all mCherry ΔretSΔtse/i1-6 wells at all time-points to determine the relationship between the mCherry signal and the autofluorescence in the GFP channel. Subtract the autofluorescence signal from the co-cultures.\nPlot the trajectories and fit a modified logistic equation to each trajectory to extract parameters using least squares fitting in either a spreadsheet software or a custom scripting software.\nLook for correlations between and among GFP and mCherry trajectory parameters.\nSubscription Required.
