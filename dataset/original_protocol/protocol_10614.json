    "1. Microfabrication of Microwell Array Substrate\nStart with a 4 inch silicon wafer with 100 nm of thermally grown oxide.\nSpin SPR-955 0.7 photoresist on the wafer at 4,000 rpm for 30 sec.\nBake on a hotplate at 115 °C for 90 sec.\nExpose photoresist.\n\t\nUse a mask that will create 1 µm holes arranged in a hexagonal array with a 3 µm period where the array covers a 2 mm x 2 mm area.\nExpose wafer in an i-line stepper using a step size of 6 mm and an exposure of 200 mJ/cm2.\nBake on a hotplate at 115 °C for 90 sec.\nDevelop using a spin developer to deposit 2 puddles of CD-26 on the wafer for a total development time of 90 sec.\nRinse thoroughly with ultrapure DI water and dry with N2.\nEtch the oxide in a reactive-ion etcher for 6 min with 50 sccm of Ar, 25 sccm of CF4, and 50 sccm of CHF3 flowing at a pressure of 75 mTorr.\nEtch silicon in an ICP deep-trench reactive-ion etcher for 2 min with 63 sccm of C4F8, 27 sccm of SF6, 40 sccm of Ar, and 10 sccm of O2 flowing at a pressure of 14 mTorr.\nRinse in acetone, methanol, and isopropanol to remove resist.\nPlace in a bath of H2SO4:H2O2 1:1 for 10 min to clean the surface.\nRinse thoroughly with ultrapure DI water and dry with N2.\nDeposit 1,080 Å of Al2O3 by atomic layer deposition at 250 °C.\n2. Preparation of Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Squeegee\nIf possible, work in a cleanroom. Otherwise work in the cleanest environment possible.\nObtain a plastic Petri dish (or other clean disposable container) with ≥13 mm sides.",
    "In that dish, pour out 5 g PDMS curing agent, followed by 50 g PDMS base agent (or anything with a 1:10 ratio that will mostly fill the Petri dish). Mix thoroughly with a disposable plastic pipette or rod.\nRemove bubbles by placing the mixed PDMS in a chamber with a vacuum line, applying vacuum until bubbles come out of mixture (approximately 30 min).\nIf not already in the Petri dish, pour PDMS in Petri dish, avoiding creation of air bubbles.\nCure overnight on a hotplate at >50 °C (higher heat for less time also works).\nWith new/clean razor blade, carefully cut a rectangular piece approximately 2.5 x 2.5 cm, keeping top surface as clean as possible. Peel out with a clean forceps. Trim off one edge (down to 1.5 cm) by pressing down on razor blade in one motion, to make top edge as sharp as possible (this will be the edge used in the squeegee process).\nClean with acetone, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, and ultrapure DI water, and then blow dry with clean nitrogen gas. Store in a clean Petri dish.\n3. Preparation of Vesicles\nCollect lipid stock solutions of 25 mg/ml egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 1 mg/ml 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) ammonium salt (Rho-DPPE) in chloroform and a 0.5 mg/ml stock solution of monosialoganglioside GM1 in chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v).\nIn a small glass vial make a mixture that results in 97 mol% PC, 2 mol% GM1 and 1 mol% Rho-DPPE by adding 18.9 µl of 25 mg/ml PC, 39.6 µl of 0.5 mg/ml GM1 and 7.9 µl of 1 mg/ml Rho-DPPE using glass syringes.\nNote: The supplementary material for Nair et al.25 contains an excellent customizable Excel spreadsheet for calculating the amounts of lipids required to create vesicles of any desired composition.",
    "Place vial in a vacuum desiccator and remove the solvent by leaving the vial under vacuum for 6 hr.\nMake an aqueous solution of 0.1 M NaCl. Add 0.5 ml of the 0.1 M NaCl solution to the vial containing the dried lipid film.\nAllow the aqueous lipid mixture to rest overnight.\nBriefly vortex mix to create a vesicle suspension, then sonicate for 20 min in a bath sonicator at room temperature.\nExtrude the vesicle suspension through a polycarbonate membrane with 100 nm pore size. Pass the vesicle suspension through the filter 17x.\nStore the extruded vesicles in a glass vial at 4 °C.  \n4. Formation of Spherical Supported Lipid Bilayers\nCollect 700 nm diameter SiO2 beads. The beads are supplied in distilled water with a stock concentration of 1.4 x 1011 beads/ml.\nIn a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube prepare a 1 ml bead suspension with a concentration of 1.5 x 1010 beads/ml by adding 107 µl of bead stock solution to 893 µl of 0.1 M NaCl.\nVortex the suspension to ensure it is well mixed.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 1,700 x g for 20 min then discard the supernatant. Resuspend the beads in 1 ml of 0.1 M NaCl. Repeat this step twice more to thoroughly wash the beads.\nTo form the SSLBs, in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube add 25 µl of the SiO2 bead suspension to 200 µl of 1 mg/ml vesicle suspension. Vortex the mixture and let stand for 1 hr at room temperature. At this stage the SSLB concentration should be 1.7 x 109 SSLBs/ml.\nCentrifuge at 1,700 x g for 20 min to pellet the SSLBs. The pellet should appear pink due to the rupture of vesicles with Rho-DPPE on the beads.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend in 225 µl phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH = 7.4. Repeat Steps 4.6-4.7 two more times to remove any unruptured vesicles from the SSLB suspension.\n5. Assembly of SSLB Array\nCleave wafer of microwell arrays resulting in rectangular pieces with 4-6 microwell arrays per piece.\nVortex mix the SSLB suspension, then place 10 µl of SSLB suspension on each microwell array. Lest rest for 1 hr to allow SSLBs to settle to the surface.\nGently wash the microwell array chip with PBS from a wash bottle, then submerge in a PBS bath prepared in a shallow dish.\nWhile submerged, gently place the PDMS squeegee flush on the microwell array chip and gently slide it along the surface 5x to remove SSLBs that are not immobilized in microwells.\nGrip the microwell array chip with tweezers and gently shake in the PBS bath to remove any excess SSLBs.\nQuickly remove the chip from the squeegee bath and place in a fresh PBS bath until further use. Make sure the top surface of the chip remains wet to preserve the SSLBs.\nNote: The assembly method described above can be used to create arrays of natural membrane particles, like myelin particles isolated from mouse brain, or phospholipid vesicles without the SiO2 bead supports. This work is described in detail in Wittenberg et al.21 and representative results are shown below.\n6. Cholera Toxin Binding Assay\nPrepare a 2 mg/ml solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS.\nPrepare a solution with desired concentration of Alexa 488-conjugated cholera toxin B-subunit in PBS with 2 mg/ml BSA.\nRemove the SSLB array chip from the PBS bath and wick away most of the PBS solution using a laboratory wipe. Leave just enough PBS on the chip to keep the SSLB array hydrated.",
    "To prevent nonspecific binding, add 200 µl of 2 mg/ml BSA solution to the SSLB array chip. Let rest for 1 hr in a humidified box.\nWith a micropipette, remove 200 µl of solution from the top of the SSLB array chip.\nAdd 200 µl of cholera toxin solution to the SSLB array chip and let rest for 1 hr in a humidified box.\nGently wash the SSLB array chip with PBS from a wash bottle to remove any unbound cholera toxin.\nWick away excess PBS using a laboratory wipe. Before imaging cover chip with a 24 mm x 40 mm cover slip.\nImage arrays with an upright microscope using filter sets appropriate for the fluorophores of interest.\nAnalyze the fluorescence intensity of individual SSLBs in an array using the automated particle analysis function of ImageJ software.\nCompile mean fluorescence intensities from individual SSLBs into histograms that summarize the intensities of SSLBs found on a given array.\nSubscription Required.
