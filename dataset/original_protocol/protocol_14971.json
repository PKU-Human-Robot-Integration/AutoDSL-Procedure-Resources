    "All animals were housed under pathogen-free conditions at the University of Colorado Barbara Davis Center Animal Facility under IACUC approval and cared for according to NIH guidelines.\nDepth of anesthesia is judged by toe pinch initially and by observance of respiration rate once the procedure has begun.\n1. Donor Heart Harvest\nAnesthetize the donor mouse by injecting pentobarbital (60 mg/kg IP).\nImmobilize the mouse by 4-way restraints and clip the fur. Wipe the skin with alcohol.\nAfter dissecting away the skin, open the abdominal cavity by making a transverse incision just inferior to the diaphragm.\nCut the diaphragm posterior to costal insertion and lift the anterior chest wall anteriorly and superiorly exposing the heart.\nExtend a full thickness cut up the posterior lateral thoracic cavity on the left and right sides of the chest.\nIsolate the inferior vena cava (IVC) and place a loose 5-0 silk suture around the IVC adjacent to its insertion into the right atrium.\nInject 1.0 cc of 4 °C heparinized saline (200 u/cc) into the IVC, then ligate the vessel with the 5-0 silk suture and divide.\nIsolate the right superior vena cava (rSVC) in similar fashion and ligate with 5-0 silk suture and divide.\nGently roll the heart towards the animals' right side and isolate the left superior vena cava (lSVC), ligate with a 5-0 silk suture and divide exposing the left pulmonary artery.\nSecure the heart under a wet gauze while the thymus is blunt dissected away from the main pulmonary artery (PA) and the left and right PA branches and ascending aortic arch.\nBlunt dissect the aortic arch free of the surrounding tissues. Micro-scissors are used to divide the aorta proximal to the right brachial-cephalic artery; i.e. there should be no branches between the heart and the division point of the aorta.",
    "This section of the aortic arch forms the arterial cuff for the implant process.\nReflect the aortic cuff inferiorly to expose the PA trunk and the left and right branches of the PA.\nBlunt dissect the left and right PA branches away from the surrounding tissues as far from the heart as possible. This allows for easy dissection of the PA trunk from surrounding tissues.\nDivide the PA trunk as distally as possible, just proximal to its bifurcation. This section of the pulmonary artery forms the venous cuff for the implant process.\nPlace a 5-0 silk suture around the base of the heart and tie. The heart is then cut free at the base, and placed in 4 °C saline. Total harvest time is approx. 10-15 min.\n2. Heart Implant Technique\nAnesthetize the recipient mice with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg IP initial dose, 25 mg/kg IP supplemental dose if required).\nClip the fur and immobilize the mouse by 4-way restraints and prep the skin with povidone-iodine and drape in a sterile fashion.\nMake a 2 cm midline vertical abdominal incision and enter the abdominal cavity.\nRetract the bowel superiorly and externalized on to the chest. Keep wrapped in sterile moist gauze (sterile saline) throughout the case.\nIsolate the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) below the renal vessels and place 4-0 cotton ties around the aorta and IVC superior then inferior to the anastomosis site.\nIdentify any lumbar vessels within the field and ligate with 10-0 nylon suture.\nKnot the cotton ties, first the inferior followed by the superior. In this way some blood is retained in the aorta making the aortotomy easier.",
    "Form the aortotomy with a 30 G needle to enter the lumen of the aorta. Extend the incision with fine micro scissors to a length of approximately 2 mm. This incision is made in a straight line along the longitudinal axis of the vessel.\nMake an end to side anastomosis of the donor aorta to the recipient aorta in the following fashion. Place a 10-0 nylon suture stay stitch in the donor aorta and to the inferior angle of the incision in the recipient aorta and tie. Place a second 10-0 nylon opposite the first in the donor aorta and the superior corner of the incision in the abdominal aorta and tie.\nMake a running suture line from superior to inferior in the lateral wall of the aorta and tie against the previously placed stay stitch. Be sure to bring the intimas (inner vessel surface) together as you stitch. Then suture the medial side in a running fashion and tie. The first and last stitch on each side should be placed as close to the stay stitches as possible. Then aim to have 3 evenly spaced stitches between these two making a total of 5 stitches.\nMake an end to side anastomosis of the donor pulmonary artery to the recipient IVC in the following fashion. Puncture the IVC with a 30 G needle and extend the incision for approx. 2 mm with fine micro scissors. This incision is made in a straight line along the longitudinal axis of the vessel.\nTie the donor pulmonary artery to the inferior corner of the incision in the IVC with 10-0 nylon. Place a second 10-0 nylon opposite the first in the donor artery and the superior corner of the incision in the IVC and tie.",
    "Make a running suture line between the pulmonary artery and the IVC and tie. The first and last stitch on each side should be placed as close to the stay stitches as possible. Then aim to have 5 evenly spaced stitches between these two making a total of 7 stitches.\nRelease the distal 4-0 cotton tie re-establishing venous flow.\nOnce hemostasis of the venous anastomosis has been observed the proximal 4-0 cotton tie is gradually loosened and the arterial anastomosis observed for hemostasis. When both anastomoses are considered secure, remove the cotton ties from the mouse.\nReturn the bowel to the abdomen. The abdominal wall is closed in two layers using 5-0 Silk suture in a running fashion.\nAdminister a 1.0 ml bolus of sterile, warm normal saline into the abdomen as fluid resuscitation upon closing, and 0.8 ml of normal saline is injected subcutaneously post-operatively. No other supportive measures are required during the surgery. Recover the animal on a warming blanket. Total implant time is approx. 90-120 min for beginners, 45-60 min with experience. Administer buprenorphine analgesia, 0.05 mg/kg, SC, 0.1-0.2 ml at the beginning of the procedure and every 6-12 hr for 72 hr post-op. \n3. Graft assessment\nAssess graft function daily by trans-abdominal palpation.\nHold the mouse as though it were to be given an intraperitoneal injection.\nGently press the tip of a forefinger against the abdominal wall and ascertain the beating strength and regularity of the graft.\nGive palpation quality a score from 4 (normal amplitude and frequency) to 0 (non-beating rejected graft).\nIMPORTANT NOTES:",
    "All instruments are sterilized, sterile gloves are worn throughout the procedure and a sterile field is maintained. The donor and recipient surgeries are performed with the use of an operating microscope. Ensure that the anastomoses are “clean”. That is, that the back walls are not caught when placing stitches. This will cause a significant constriction to flow that will more than likely result in a failed graft and in extreme cases to hind-limb paralysis. It is also vitally important that full thickness passes including the vascular adventitia and the intima of the suture needle are achieved. Evertion of the edges also ensures that there is intima-to-intima contact, which aids in sealing and healing of the anastomoses. Another vitally important factor is ensuring that the tension of the anastomotic suture lines is also optimal. Too loose and there will be irreversible leaking, too tight and stricture to flow will result. If on the arterial side this will result in poor perfusion of the graft, if on the venous side a congested heart will result."
