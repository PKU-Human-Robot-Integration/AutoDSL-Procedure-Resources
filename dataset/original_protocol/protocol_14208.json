    "The protocol involving human subjects was approved by all participating Institutes' Research Committee. Each center implementing the technique is responsible for the application to its institutional human research ethics committee for approval.\n1. Solution Preparation\nPrepare Solutions #1, #2 and #3, which are base solutions, in 1 L batches prior to the procedure and stored on-site (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: Amiloride is light sensitive and must be stored in the dark (see Table 1 for solution composition) (see SOP for detailed solution preparation11).\n\t\nBuffer all solutions at pH 7.4 and filter with a 0.22 µm bottle-top filter.\nFor solution #3, add the phosphate-containing salts first, allow them to ionize to prevent crystallization (See Table 2 for solution composition).\n\t\tNOTE: The sequence of mixing is critical for solution #3.\nStore these solutions at 4 °C (stable for 3 months) or at -20 °C (stable for 6 months).\nPrepare solutions #4 and #5 by adding agents on the day of the NPD test. Isoproterenol is light and oxidation sensitive and it loses its activity at room temperature (demonstrating 4% decay over 4 h at 4–8 °C). Store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: ATP is light and oxidation sensitive (see Table 3).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nCompound,Molecular Weight,Concentration (mM),Composition (g/L)\nNaCl,58,148,8.58\nCaCl2 2H2O,147,2.25,0.33\nKCl,75,4.05,0.3\nK2HPO4,174,2.4,0.42\nKH2 PO4,136,0.4,0.05\nMgCl2 6H2O,203,1.2,0.24\nTable 1: Solution Composition.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nCompound,Molecular Weight,Concentration (mM),Composition (g/L)\nNa Gluconate,218,148,33.26\nCa Gluconate,430,2.25,0.97\nK Gluconate,234,4.05,0.95\nK2 HPO4,174,2.4,0.42\nKH2 PO4,136,0.4,0.05\nMgSO4 7H2O,246,1.2,0.24\nTable 2: Solution Composition.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nSolution,Solution Number,Contents,EDC Mark\nRingers injection,Solution #1/A,Buffered ringers for injection,RINGERS\nRingers + amiloride,Solution #2/B,Buffered ringers + 100 μM amiloride,AMIL\nZero Cl- + amiloride,Solution #3/C,Buffered zero Cl- + 100 μM amiloride,OCL\nZero Cl- + amiloride + isoproterenol,Solution #4/D,Buffered zero Cl- + 100 μM amiloride + 10 μM isoproterenol,ISO",

Catheter\nUse a PVC, sterile, single use, 2 lumens (0.7 mm inner Ø) catheter with a round and smooth extremity (2.5 mm outer Ø), which is specifically designed for NPD.\nMake contacts with the mucosa by a side hole, 2 mm distant to the tip with a hole at the tip for perfusion (see step 10.1).\nConnect one of the two Luer-lock connections of the catheter to the measuring electrode and the other one to the perfusion pump. Use the channel stained in blue as the measuring lumen. Tag the catheter at each 0.5 cm interval for 10 cm.\n\t\tNOTE: The dead space is 0.3 mL. It is preferable to use the above procedure for the preparation of the catheter if this is not possible follow the next two steps.\nCut equal (~76 cm) lengths of PE50 and PE90 catheter tubing.\nAffix these together in a 1 cm piece of silicon rubber tubing. Insert a 25 G blunt tip needle snuggly into the opposite end of the PE-90 tubing. Insert a 25 G butterfly needle snuggly into the opposite end of the PE50 tubing making sure not to puncture the tubing as it is placed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57006/57006fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Catheter used for NPD measurements. Inset box demonstrates the catheter tip with measuring hole.\n3. Preparation of Agar Skin Bridge (Butterfly Needle) and Catheter\nNOTE: The manipulation of the melted agar may cause burns, and this should be done with caution.\nPrepare 3% agar by mixing 3 g of agar with 100 mL of solution #1 in a wide-mouth bottle. Melt the agar in the microwave until soluble (transparent).",
    "Fill the 10 mL syringe with warm agar.\nConnect the syringe subsequently to the butterfly needle (23 G) and to the marked lumen of the catheter. Inject the agar until it appears at the tip.\nAllow it to cool for at least 10 min.\nEnsure that the skin bridge and the catheter are fully filled and visualized to be free of air bubbles.\nStore the bulk skin bridges in solution #1 at 4 °C and do not use after 1 week.\n4. If Using ECG cream\nDilute the ECG cream with solution #1 (1:1, v/v Ringer). Let it rest until free of air bubbles.\nFill the 10 mL syringe with diluted ECG cream.\nConnect the syringe to the marked lumen of the catheter and slowly inject the ECG cream until it appears at the lower side hole.\nEnsure that the catheter is fully filled and free of air bubbles.\n5. Data Acquisition System\nNOTE: The general setup of the data acquisition system is shown in Figure 5.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57006/57006fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Set up of the data acquisition system. Demonstrating connections of the bioamplifier and headstage to the computer interface as well as the electrode connections to the headstage11. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57006/57006fig5large.jpg]\nConnections\nConnect the computer to the data acquisition system (Table of Materials) with a USB cable.\nTo connect the data acquisition system to the bioamplifier, connect the BNC cable from the channel 1 input on the data acquisition system (front) to the output on the bioamplifier (back).\nConnect the bioamplifier to the headstage with a custom cable pre-connected to the headstage screws into the input portion in the front of the bioamplifier.",
    "Connect the headstage to the electrodes and the ground electrode. Use standard 2 mm female-female connectors to connect the front of headstage to the electrodes.\n\t\tNOTE: The port is recessed and only fits one direction of the 2 mm cable: Red-measuring electrode to the patient nose (via nasal catheter); Black-Reference electrode to patient skin bridge; White to ECG electrode grounded to subject's skin.\nSet the bioamplifier as described: Offset: pull to activate, turn to adjust, leave in pulled position after adjustment; Voltage: DC; 1 mV cal: neutral position; Power: On to collect data, off to charge battery; Gain: set to 10; Band pass: LoFreq (Outer knob): DC; Band pass: HighFreq (Inner knob): 1kHz; Volume: Off.\n6. Adjusting the Head-stage Offset\nConnect the laptop and the amplifier in the sequence as indicated in the SOP11. Switch on the data acquisition system and then the laptop (the sequence is important for the software to recognize the apparatus used for data acquisition).\nAdjust the Head-Stage Offset as per the SOP sequence.\n7. Offsets\nNOTE: There are several offsets to be tested to ensure the stability of the electrical measuring system. (see Figure 6)\nFor the Electrode Offset, place the reference (negative) electrode and measuring (positive) electrode together in the diluted ECG cream or the 3 M KCl. Ensure that the potential difference reading between the electrodes is near zero on the headstage.\nFor setting the catheter and/or skin bridge offset, place the Luer-lock end of the nasal catheter or the Luer-lock end of the skin bridge into the bath with the measuring (positive) electrode. Place the other end of the catheter in the ECG cream bath or 3 M KCL containing the reference (negative) electrode ensuring that the potential difference is near zero on the headstage.",
    "To set up a closed loop offset, ensure that the circuit is closed when replacing the nasal catheter in the bath of the electrodes. Check that the closed loop offset reads near 0 mV (='offset'; ±2.5 mV). Adjust the headstage offset knob to bring the offset to 0 mV.\n\t\tNOTE: This confirms that all connections within the circuit are intact. If this is not the case, the nasal catheter may not be intact (air bubbles in the agar or the ECG cream). Change the agar bridge or push the ECG cream in the setup. The electrode offset must be performed first, followed by the closed system (closed loop offset) with the electrode and the bridge (Figure 6).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57006/57006fig6.jpg\nFigure 6: Setup of (A) Electrode offset, (B) Catheter (or bridge) offset, (C) Closed loop offset.\n8. Syringe Set-up\nNOTE: The following is the recommended set-up.\nThaw solutions #1, #2 and #3 approximately 1 h before the measurement.\nConnect the extension line to the stopcock closest to the catheter.\nSwitch on all pumps and flush the catheter with solution #1 to completely flush off the catheter until stopcocks are clear of bubbles.\n9. Placement of the Reference and Measurement Electrode\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57006/57006fig7.jpg\nFigure 7: Subject with measuring electrode and subcutaneous bridge ready for measurements.\nHave the study subject take a seated position facing the NPD operator. For more comfort, place feet on the optional anti-static mat and head on the orthoptic chin rest.\nConnect the ground lead electrode to the ECG pad placed on the subject's arm (Figure 7).\nEither insert the subcutaneous needle into the dorsal forearm (agar system) or apply the reference electrode to the ECG cream on a previously minimally abraded area on the forearm (see points 7 through to 10 below).",
    "Check the connection to the subcutaneous space by measuring the potential difference with the skin (Finger PD) and asking the subject to close the \"measuring hole\" by pinching the catheter between the tip of his/her thumb and index finger.\nIf the Finger PD is not -30 mV or more negative, check the insertion of the butterfly needle. Repeat the abrasion (for ECG cream set-up) and check bridges.\nStart the solution #1 syringe pump at 80 mL/h. Start with the right nostril.\nMeasure the Finger PD as a steady negative voltage (typical range -40 to -80 mV).\nIf using the ECG Cream System: dilute the ECG cream 1:1 and fill the catheter after a complete flush off out of the probe hole as previously seen for the Agar.\nConnect the catheter to a 50 mL syringe half-filled with the ECG cream to bathe the electrodes, allowing a check of the electrode offset and the bridge off set.\nConnect the reference Ag/Cl electrode to the subcutaneous space by slight previous minimal abrasion of the skin, the skin will appear ‘pink and shiny’ when the level of the dermis is reached.\nPosition the measuring electrode, covered with ECG cream, on the abraded skin. Check the finger PD as previously shown for the Agar system.\n10. Measurement of Basal PD\nInsert the nasal catheter into the right nostril using an illuminating rhinoscope (or equivalent) to visualize the inferior turbinate. Using the anterior tip as a landmark, advance the catheter targeting the inferior site of the inferior turbinate on the respiratory mucosa. Alternatively, if the placement is difficult, the probe hole can be placed in contact with the floor of the nostril.",
    "NOTE: The catheter is rigid enough to be guided into the nostril by the operator. To facilitate the placement, one channel of the catheter is colored in blue and contains the probe-side hole in contact with the inferior turbinate. This prevents catheter rotation. The marks indicated on the catheter from 1 to 10 cm provide easy reference points.\n\t\nMeasure the PD at the inferior turbinate. For this purpose, ensure that the measuring hole of the catheter is closed by its placement against the mucosa of the inferior turbinate (mark Right Basal AT).\nMeasure the PD at 3.0, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 cm (distance within the inferior meatus from the inferior turbinate): mark Right Basal PDs.\nMaintain each measurement at the specified distance for approximately 5 s each to ensure a steady reading (± 1 mV) and to facilitate accurate interpretation of basal PD values.\nRepeat the steps above in the left nostril, using the function key to mark the Left Basal PDs (3 cm, 2 cm, etc.) and the Left Basal AT.\nUsing basal PD measures as a guide, insert the probe of the nasal catheter to the site of most negative signal (up to 3 cm from the anterior tip of the inferior nasal turbinate), and secure with a small piece of tape on the tip of the nose (or equivalent).\n11. NPD Tracing Sequential Perfusions\nFor the Right Nostril\nVerify that the solution is dripping from the patient's nose. Have the subject assume a comfortable position with their head down (often helped by having the subject rest their head on their hand or use a chinrest or other immobilizing device). Remind the subject to minimize the movement and avoid touching nose or the tubing, and to avoid talking.",
    "Turn solution #1 (Ringers) pump on (5 mL/min, or 300 mL/h). Record until a stable value is obtained (<1 mV change/30 s).\n\t\tNOTE: This takes approximately 3 min to achieve stability.\nTurn off the perfusion with solution #1.\nStart the perfusion with solution #2 (Amiloride). Record NPD for a minimum of 3 min (if the plateau voltage is in doubt, continue the recording for up to 5 min total).\nStart the perfusion with solution #3 (Zero Chloride). Record NPD for a minimum of 3 min (if the plateau voltage is not stable, continue the recording for up to 5 min total).\nStart the perfusion with solution #4 (Isoproterenol). Record NPD for a minimum of 3 min [if the plateau voltage is not stable (a steady voltage tracing for at least 30 s of < 1 mV drift), continue the recording for up to 5 min total].\nStart the perfusion with solution #5 (ATP). Record NPD for a minimum of 1 min, until a peak hyperpolarizing response is obtained.\nTurn on the perfusion with the solution #1 (Ringers) and allow 30 s to flush the catheter.\nTurn off the solution #1 perfusion.\nRepeat the procedure for the left nostril.\n12. End of the Test\nRecheck and record stable Finger PD (\"Post Finger\") for 5 s.\nRemove the subject's cutaneous bridge and the bandage from the insertion site on the skin. For the AgCl/ECG Cream System, remove the electrode from the arm.\nRecord the \"Final Closed Loop Offset\" voltage as described for measuring the initial closed loop offset (see step 7.1.3).\nMark final offset with the Function key.\nStop data acquisition (Press \"Start\").",
    "NOTE: The current SOP recommends the use of 100 µM ATP to activate the purinergic calcium dependent Cl- secretion, to serve as a positive control for the test; however, this is an optional test."
