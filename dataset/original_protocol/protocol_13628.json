    "The Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol, and samples of the dilated left atrium (LA) tissues in the dextrocardia cases were collected for electron microscopy after written informed consent had been obtained.\n1. Surgical procedure and ablation\nPerform a median sternotomy and suspend the left lateral pericardium after opening.\n\t\nCannulate the ascending aorta and the superior and inferior vena cava (SVC, IVC) to establish mild hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\nHave the operator switch position from the right side to the left of the operating table after establishing the bypass.\nGive antegrade cold blood cardioplegia intermittently from the aortic root to achieve cardioplegic arrest.\nPerform the right atrial (RA) incision on the left side of the heart, parallel to the atrioventricular sulcus, providing exposure for subsequent RA ablation and tricuspid valve surgery. Ensure the left-sided left atriotomy is located parallelly under the interatrial groove.\nPlace a retractor on the wall of LA for sufficient exposure to perform LA ablation and approach the mitral valve (MV).\nMake an aortic incision via a transverse aortotomy performed specially for selective antegrade cardioplegia into the left and right coronary orifices and subsequent AV surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: This was done for the second patient.\nCryoablation\n\tNOTE: In the previous two patients, cryoablation was performed exclusively using a flexible, 10 cm long, metal cryoprobe (see the Table of Materials). The cryoprobe uses nitrous oxide (N2O) gas to achieve rapid atrial tissue freezing to a target of -60 °C10.\n\t\nDesign the cryolesion set to replicate the mirror image of the CMP-IV lesion set. Set the duration of the LA cryoablation for each lesion at -60 °C for 2 min.\n\t\t\nEnsure the posterior LA box lesion is composed of the LA incision and the cryolesion encircling the left and right pulmonary veins.",
    "Apply a cryolesion line to connect the left superior pulmonary vein with the left atrial appendage (LAA).\nForm an ice ball to mark the coronary sinus using cryoablation from the epicardium (Figure 2). When performing the mitral isthmus line, place the cryoprobe at the inferior aspect of the left atriotomy and direct it to the mitral annulus at the 8 o'clock position, across the posterior LA and coronary sinus, as marked with the ice ball (Figure 3A).\nApply right-sided LAA amputation.\nAfter the LA cryoablation, sample 4 x 8 mm tissue of the cryoablated LA for electron microscopic examination. In addition, sample a similar, large, nonablated tissue from the margin of the LA incision for the control test.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Nonablated tissue was sampled in the second case.\nPerform prosthetic valve replacement surgery with a 27 mm mechanical MV using a 2-0 polypropylene running suture. Replace a 23 mm mechanical AV with 2-0 polypropylene running sutures.\n\tNOTE: The mechanical MV replacement surgery was performed on the first patient, whereas the replacement with the mechanical AV was done for the second patient.\nPerform the RA cryoablation during the CPB, with the heart warm and beating, for 2 min at -60 °C for each ablation lesion.\n\t\nCreate the linear cryoablation lines from the inferior aspect of the left-sided right atriotomy up onto the SVC and down to the IVC (Figure 3B).\nMake the tricuspid isthmus linear cryolesion from the midportion of the right atriotomy, directed endocardially toward the tricuspid annulus at the 10 o'clock position (Figure 3B and Figure 4).\nMake a lateral cryolesion from the midportion of the right atriotomy up to the tip of the right atrial appendage (RAA).\nPerform three-dimensional (3D) printing of the heart in advance, using the derived cardiac CT data (Figure 5)11.",
    "NOTE: This was done for the third patient.\n\t\nAccess the left atrium through the interatrial groove during the operation. Extend the mitral isthmus lesion to the posterior mitral annulus for the left atrial lesion sets and ablate the coronary sinus in the endocardium and epicardium with a bipolar radiofrequency pen.\n\t\t\nMake other lesions using bipolar radiofrequency clamps: (i) bilateral pulmonary vein isolation; (ii) ablation lines connecting the left atrial appendage and the left superior pulmonary vein; (iii) ablation lines connecting the right and the left superior pulmonary veins; (iv) ablation lines connecting the right and the left inferior pulmonary veins, and (v) mitral line lesions (Figure 3A).\nDissect the Marshall ligament, and separate the left atrial appendage using an epicardial atrial clamp closure device. Use bipolar radiofrequency forceps to ablate the entire right atrial lesion sets, including the annular tricuspid valve lesions, superior and inferior vena cava lesion lines, and lesion lines connecting the right atrium incision to the right atrial appendage (Figure 3B).\nResect the A1 ruptured chordae, implant a single, flexible, artificial chord with 4-0 expanded polytetrafluoroethylene in situ (see the Table of Materials), and close the residual leak of the anterior commissure and the A2 leaflet cleft.\n\t\t\nImplant a 32 mm, rigid mitral ring to stabilize the annulus. Ensure that the coaptation height is 9 mm after the mitral valve reconstruction. After de-airing and closure of the interatrial sulcus incision, remove the aortic clamp, then make a longitudinal incision on the surface of the right atrium.\nPerform the tricuspid annuloplasty with a 30 mm tricuspid ring or with a 28 mm band, implanting them in an \"upside-down\" and particularly \"mirror-image inversion\" manner using 2-0 polyester interrupted sutures (Figure 6). Remove the holder before fixation of the annuloplasty ring.",
    "NOTE: Tricuspid annuloplasty was performed in the previous two patients, while the band was used in the third case.\nEnsure that sinus rhythm is restored in all patients without any atrioventricular block before cardiopulmonary bypass weaning. Fix temporary epicardial pacing wires after the cardiac surgery.\n2. Postoperative management and follow-up\nMonitor all patients by continuous ECG recordings during hospitalization to ensure no early AF recurrence occurs.\nAdminister antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) orally, with 200 mg/day of amiodarone routinely, for the first 3-6 months to prevent recurrence of AF.\nAdminister warfarin for oral anticoagulation and test prothrombin time (PT) regularly.\nPerform chest roentgenogram, TTE, ECG, and 24 h Holter before discharge.\nAfter hospital discharge, follow all patients with clinical examination, PT test, TTE, ECG, and 24 h Holter at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after surgery.\n\tNOTE: The third patient was followed during a 12-month follow-up period.\nSubscription Required.
