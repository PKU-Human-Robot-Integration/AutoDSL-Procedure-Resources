    "1. Recreating the Internal Sample Compartment of an FTIR Spectrometer Inside an Anaerobic, Dry Glovebox and General Experimental Requirements\nUse a commercial FTIR spectrometer equipped with an external mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector and ATR accessory. Purge the body of the spectrometer with dry air or dinitrogen, or alternatively use a spectrometer with an evacuated optical bench.\nPlace the spectrometer onto a stable, vibration-free table at the same height as an anaerobic (<1 ppm O2), dry (dew point < -75 °C) glovebox. Divert the IR beam of the spectrometer into the glovebox, through an IR transparent window that is large enough to accommodate the defocused beam.\n\tNOTE: It is important that the space between the glovebox and spectrometer is also purged or evacuated, especially if a hygroscopic window material, such as NaCl or KBr for example, is used.\nReplicate the internal sample compartment of the spectrometer inside the glovebox.\nDirect the beam inside the glovebox onto an off-axis ellipsoidal mirror, ideally with the same focal length as the internal focusing mirror of the spectrometer.\n\t\tNOTE: It is useful to have two additional plane mirrors placed before this focusing mirror, in order to allow both the height and the direction of the IR beam to be adjusted inside the glovebox; this will offset any inaccuracy in initial placement of the spectrometer.\nPlace an external MCT detector, complete with a suitable focusing optic (such as a short focal length ZnSe lens, or off-axis parabolic mirror, with a short focal length) inside the glovebox, positioned such as to replicate the dimensions of the internal sample compartment of the spectrometer.\nAdjust the 'focus' of the IR beam to be approximately equidistant between the focusing mirror and the MCT detector.\nCool the dewar of the external MCT detector with liquid nitrogen.",
    "Mount the ATR accessory into the glovebox sample compartment. Align the input and output focusing optics and ATR accessory to achieve maximum throughput to the MCT detector. If necessary, use an aperture or other suitable attenuation (such as a wire grid) to prevent oversaturation of the detector signal.\n\tNOTE: For the data presented here, a five-reflection ATR accessory with all reflective optics and a removable trapezoidal Si internal reflection element (IRE) is used (Crystal GmbH, dimensions ca 5 × 8 × 1 mm3, face angle 39.5°). The IRE is mounted in a removable baseplate machined from polyether ether ketone (PEEK).\nUse a glovebox to house the recreated sample compartment with suitable feedthroughs to allow connection to an externally-housed potentiostat (gas tight BNC connections are useful for this purpose), gas access, and cable(s) to transfer the signal from the MCT detector. It is important to retain any shielding on the detector cable to avoid introducing noise or interference to the measurements.\nPlace a peristaltic pump, capable of flow rates greater than 60 mL/min inside the glovebox. A schematic view of the spectrometer, ATR accessory, peristaltic pump and potentiostat setup is shown in Figure 1.\nConstruct a spectroelectrochemical cell, such as that shown schematically in Figure 2, that seals onto the ATR accessory. The cell should contain a high surface area counter electrode (Pt wire or gauze), a connection for the working electrode (carbon rod) and a miniature reference electrode. The cell should contain at least two further ports as inlet and outlet for rapid flow of solutions through the cell.\n\tNOTE: A miniature saturated calomel reference electrode is ideal for this purpose.36\n2. Preparation of Carbon Black Particles Modified with E. coli Hydrogenase 1",
    "In a 'wet' anaerobic glovebox, mix 20 mg of high surface area carbon black particles (>1,000 m3/g) with 1 mL ultrahigh purity water (resistivity >18 MΩ cm) in a microcentrifuge tube. Disperse the particles by low-power sonication (<100 W) for at least 15 min, or until the dispersion is uniform and does not sediment within 1 h, to give a carbon black dispersion with a loading of approximately 20 mg/mL.\nTake an aliquot of E. coli hydrogenase 1 (Hyd1, approximately 50 µL, prepared according to a published procedure55) at a concentration of ~7 mg protein/mL and exchange it into a low ionic strength buffer at a pH close to the isoelectric point (for example potassium phosphate, 15 mM, pH 5.8, no additional salt). To achieve best results, use an enzyme preparation that is as active as possible. Perform the buffer exchange by concentration and dilution, in a centrifugal filter device with an appropriate molecular weight cutoff (50 kDa works well for for Hyd1).\nAdd the Hyd1 to the filter device.\nDilute with approximately 450 µL of exchange buffer.\nReconcentrate to a volume of 50 µL using mild centrifugation (< ~2700 × g) to prevent irreversible precipitation.\nRepeat steps 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 until buffer exchange is complete (typically within ~5 cycles).\nMix a 5 µL volume of 20 mg/mL carbon black dispersion (prepared in 2.1) with the 50 µL aliquot of buffer-exchanged Hyd1. Store the enzyme-particle mixture in a refrigerator (at 0 °C) overnight to allow the enzyme to adsorb. It may be necessary to shake the mixture occasionally to ensure the particles remain dispersed.",
    "Wash the Hyd1-modified particles with low ionic strength buffer (potassium phosphate, 15 mM, pH 5.8, no additional salt) by successive sedimentation and re-dispersion cycles in a microcentrifuge (~2,700 × g). Repeat this process 3-5 times to remove non-adsorbed enzyme.\n\tNOTE: Before the first wash the supernatant should be virtually colorless, indicating good adsorption of enzyme.\nConcentrate the particles to a final volume of ~5 µL, to give a final loading of ~20 mg/mL of enzyme-modified particles.\n\tNOTE: The Hyd1-modified particles can be stored at 4 °C for up to two weeks if they remain hydrated; this is best achieved by storing particles diluted with ~50 µL of ultrahigh purity water.\n3. Preparation for PFIRE Measurements on E. coli Hydrogenase 1\nClean the Si IRE by low-powered sonication (< 100 W), first in H2SO4 (< 90 % w/w) for ~15 min, and then in HNO3 (70 % w/w) for up to 1 hr. This cleaning procedure should lead to a hydrophilic IRE surface. If further cleaning is required the IRE can be placed in piranha solution (a 1:3 ratio of H2O2:H2SO4) to oxidize any remaining organic material.\n\tNOTE: Harsh acidic cleaning methods may not be suitable for use with all IRE materials. Piranha solution is highly corrosive and a strong oxidant, surfaces should be reasonably clean before use of piranha solution and care should be taken during preparation and use of piranha solution due to the exothermic nature of the process - always add H2O2 slowly to H2SO4 and refer to the appropriate safety procedures for preparation, use and disposal.\nRinse the clean IRE in ultrahigh purity water, and dry under a stream of dry nitrogen gas. Carry out all prism handling using clean tweezers to avoid contamination.",
    "Seal the IRE into the ATR accessory baseplate using a thin strip of electrical-grade silicone sealant. Take care to restrict the sealant to the edges of the IRE. Allow the sealant to dry fully.\nTransfer the ATR accessory baseplate to the spectrometer glovebox and mount it onto the ATR accessory. Measure a reference (background) spectrum between 4000 - 1,000 cm-1 at 4 cm-1 resolution, using the standard rapid scan mode of the spectrometer and 1024 averaged interferograms (measurement time ~3 - 5 min). Use this spectrum as an input to allow computation of absorbance spectra later in the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Due to the small absorbance expected for the Hyd1 active site it is necessary to collect spectra with high signal to noise ratios.\nTransfer the ATR accessory baseplate to the 'wet' glovebox which contains the pre-prepared Hyd1-modified particle dispersion (section 2). Drop-cast a 1 µL aliquot of the particle dispersion onto the large face of the IRE, and spread them evenly across the surface. Note: Do not allow the particles to become completely dry on the IRE.\nCut a piece of carbon paper, such as that used as gas diffusion layer material in fuel cells, to a size ~0.1 mm smaller than the surface dimensions of the IRE (i.e. ca. 8.2 × 4.9 mm2). The surface area of the carbon paper should be large enough to cover the drop-cast Hyd1-modified particles, but not so large as to overlap the silicone sealant used to secure the IRE. Soak the carbon paper in water, and gently place it over the top of the particle film. The carbon paper will provide a good electrical connection across the whole particle film.",
    "NOTE: It is beneficial to prepare several pieces of carbon paper in advance, and store them pre-soaked in ultrahigh purity water inside the 'wet' anaerobic glovebox.\nMount the spectroelectrochemical cell (described in 1.7 and shown schematically in Figure 2) over the IRE, secure it into the baseplate with screws. Add ~200 µL of the experimental buffer to keep the enzyme hydrated. A mixed buffer system, capable of buffering over a wide pH range, is useful for studies on NiFe hydrogenases:56 sodium acetate, 2-[N'-morpholino]ethane-sulfonic acid (MES), N'-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-ethane-sulfonic acid] (HEPES), N'-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-3-amino-propane-sulfonic acid (TAPS), and 2-[N'-cyclohexylamino]ethane-sulfonic acid (CHES), with each component at a final concentration of 15 mM and containing 0.1 M NaCl as supporting electrolyte, with pH adjusted to pH 6 using concentrated NaOH and HCl.\n\tNOTE: The working electrode connection should protrude slightly below the plane of the spectroelectrochemical cell top (~0.1 mm) to ensure good electronic connection to the carbon paper (Figure 2).\nConnect the solution inlet and outlet of the spectroelectrochemical cell to a flow system containing peristaltic pump tubing and a vial of the experimental buffer. Transfer the assembled cell to the 'dry' glovebox containing the spectrometer.\nMount the spectroelectrochemical cell assembly onto the ATR accessory. Connect the working, counter and reference electrodes to the potentiostat. Connect the peristaltic pump tubing to the pump.\nRecord an absorbance spectrum with 1024 averaged interferograms at 4 cm-1 resolution over a spectral range of 4,000 - 1,000 cm-1, using the spectrum collected in 3.4 as a reference/background. At this point the spectrum should contain significant (>100 mO.D.) amide II bands at ~1,540 cm-1 and active site bands of Hyd1 should be evident in the spectral region 1,850 - 2,150 cm-1, largely in oxidized, inactive states (Figure 3).\n4. Activation of E. coli Hydrogenase 1 and Testing the Spectroelectrochemical Cell",
    "Apply a reducing potential (−0.8 V vs SCE) to the Hyd1-modified particle film. Saturate the experimental buffer with H2 and flow buffer slowly through the spectroelectrochemical cell. Leave the sample overnight to fully activate the Hyd1.\n\tNOTE: It is important to use anaerobic H2, N2 etc., and so all anaerobic gases should be passed through an O2 filter.\nRecord an absorbance spectrum of the sample after activation. The νCO and vCN bands of the active site should now show a distribution of reduced, 'active' states. This is most easily observed through the use of a difference spectrum, relative to the spectrum recorded in 3.10 (Figure 4).\nTest the electrical connection of the spectroelectrochemical cell. To do this, saturate the experimental buffer with N2 gas. Apply a sequence of oxidizing (0 V vs SCE) and reducing (−0.8 V vs SCE) potentials (of ca 30 min duration) to the Hyd1-modified particle film, and record an absorbance spectrum at each. The Hyd1 should become rapidly oxidized and reduced, and if the particle film is well connected 100 % of the sample should respond to the applied potential.\nSet an appropriate flow rate of the experimental buffer. To do this, apply a reducing potential (−0.8 V vs SCE) to the sample, and saturate the experimental buffer with H2. Record a series of cyclic voltammograms between -0.707 - 0.039 V vs SCE at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. Gradually increase the flow rate of H2-saturated buffer between voltammograms until the catalytic waveshape resembles that at a planar rotating disc electrode55 and the maximum current is independent of flow rate (Figure 5).\n\tNOTE: The solubility limit of H2 in water is ~0.8 mM at 293 K and 1 bar.",
    "As the sample is now ready for PFIRE measurements, collect spectra at a range of potentials, under a range of solution conditions (pH, temperature, H2 concentration etc.). Record all electrochemical data using the potentiostat software as it is important to be able to correlate spectroscopic and electrochemical data, especially when studying electrocatalytic processes such as H2 oxidation by Hyd1.\n5. Spectroscopic Data Handling\nConfirm that the active site has not been permanently altered during the course of the measurements by recording spectra at 0 V and −0.8 V vs SCE at the end of the experiment. These should be identical to the spectra recorded in 4.3, and no loss of active site should be observed during the measurement (Figure 6).\nExport absolute absorbance spectra from the spectrometer software in a suitable format (.csv, ASCII, 'matlab', Jcamp etc.) for processing using software such as Origin or Matlab.\nBaseline correct the data, using the process illustrated in Figure 7.\nTake the second derivative of each absorbance spectrum in the range 1,800 - 2,150 cm-1, in order to identify small (<1 mO.D.) active site bands against the highly-curved water background.\nPlace baseline marker points on the original absorbance spectrum, and set the points to 'snap' to the experimental spectrum.\nFit a baseline through the points using an interpolated cubic spline function or a polynomial function. Subtract this baseline function from the experimental data."
