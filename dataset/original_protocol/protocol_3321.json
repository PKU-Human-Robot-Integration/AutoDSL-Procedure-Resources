Place a pair of loxP-lox2272 sequences into the MCS of the plasmid in the opposite direction with an alternate order by using synthetic DNA.\nConstruct the transfer plasmid termed pAAV-CAG-FLEX-GFP by inserting GFP cDNA in the inverted orientation between a pair of the double recognition site sequences in pAAV-CAG-MCS-WPRE by using a Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs).\nIf necessary, replace the CAG promoter with another suitable promoter, such as the human elongation factor-1α (EF1α) promoter.\nFor other transfer plasmids, replace the GFP cDNA with other genes of interest, such as red fluorescent protein (RFP; mCherry), a variant of channelrhodopsin-2 fused to Venus (ChRWR/Venus), or a mutant form of human muscarinic M4 acetylcholine receptor connected to 2A-GFP (hM4Di/2A/GFP).\nCleave the pAAV-CAG-FLEX-GFP plasmid with EcoRI or ClaI at either side of the inverted transgene and insert the USS of approximately 750 bp using Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit. For instance, the gene cassette encoding TurboFP635, a mutant of TurboFP635 (mTurboFP635) or marine copepod luciferase (Luc) are inserted between the loxP and lox2272 sites either at the 5′- or 3′-end of the transgene, resulting in pAAV-CAG-FLEX/5′USS-GFP or pAAV-CAG-FLEX/3′USS-GFP.\nTransform E.coli DH5α strain with the respective plasmids, pick up colonies, culture each colony in 3 mL of LB medium containing 50 μg/mL of ampicillin at 37°C for 8 h, and then scale up to 500 mL to be cultured for 16 h.",
    "Prepare the plasmids using the NucleoBond Xtra Maxi EF Kit (Macherey-Nagel).\nNote: 108 μg of transfection grade plasmid is necessary for transfecting eighteen 100-mm dishes of HEK293T cells. The pAAV-CAG-FLEX-GFP, pAAV-CAG-FLEX/5′USS-GFP, and pAAV-CAG-FLEX/3′USS-GFP can be obtained from Addgene (#197883, #197884, and #197885, respectively).\nPause point: Plasmids can be stored at −20°C or −80°C for years.\nPreparation of AAV vectors\nTiming: 9 days\nIn this section, we describe how to produce AAV serotype 2 vectors (AAV-CAG-FLEX-GFP and AAV-CAG-FLEX/3′USS-GFP) based on AAV Helper-Free System (Agilent Technologies) by transfecting the plasmids into HEK293T cells with the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Transfection into the cells is also carried-out with polyethylenimine or lipofectamine. The vectors are purified by using the CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation. Purification processes are summarized in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. The procedures for preparation of AAV vectors are also described in some previous reports.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3088-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Purification processes of AAV vector particles\nThe crude viral vector lysate, which is prepared from the cultured cell medium after DNA transfection, is purified with the first round of CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation by using a near-vertical tube rotor (NVT 65) with quick-seal tubes (A), and then the second round of CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation by using a swinging-bucket rotor (SW 55Ti) with thinwall polypropylene tubes (B). The solution containing the particles is collected as drops through the needle inserted into the bottom of the tubes. The solution is dialyzed against PBS by using a dialysis cassette (C), and vector particles are concentrated by ultrafiltration through a membrane filter (D).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3088_9.csv\nNote: 6 μg of each plasmid is required for transfection per a 100-mm dish. In the case of a 150-mm dish, 16.8 μg of each plasmid is required.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3088_10.csv\nNote: A total of 18 mL of the transfection mix solution is used for eighteen 100-mm dishes.",
    "Culture HEK293T cells in 100-mm cell culture dishes containing 7 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nNote: The cell culture medium should be stored at 4°C, and pre-warmed to 37°C before use.\nThe cells should be subcultured before becoming confluent on the plate.\nMaintain the cells until approximately 80% confluent.\nAspirate medium, wash cells once with 5 mL of PBS, and remove residual medium in the plate.\nDetach cells with 2 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution for 3 min at 37°C.\nNeutralize the enzymatic activity of trypsin by adding 10 mL of pre-warmed culture medium and suspend the cells by gentle pipetting.\nTransfer the suspended cells to 50-mL tubes.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in an appropriate volume of pre-warmed cell culture medium.\nAdd the suspended cells to six 100-mm cell culture dishes containing 7 mL of cell culture medium (approximately 1 mL to each dish).\nNote: After dropping the suspended cells into each dish, shake the dish gently to spread the cells over culture medium.\nIncubate the cells for 24 h in a 37°C, 5% CO2-humidified incubator.\nPrepare a transfection mixture to transfect the plasmids into the cells in eighteen 100-mm culture dishes.\nMix 108 μg for each of AAV transfer (pAAV-CAG-FLEX-GFP or pAAV-CAG-FLEX/3′USS-GFP), pRep/Cap, and pHelper plasmids (2 mg/mL for each plasmid) in 8.1 mL of ddH2O and 0.9 mL of 2.5 M calcium chloride solution in a 50-mL tube.\nAdd 9 mL of 2× HBSP solution dropwise, mixing gently with the vortex mixer.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min to form the DNA-HBSP complex.",

    "Transfer the supernatant containing vector particles to a 15-mL tube. The volume of the supernatant is approximately 5–7 mL.\nNote: Store the supernatant at 4°C during the preparation of the CsCl gradient.\nFill up the supernatant to 8.11 mL with PBS, and add 4.59 mL of saturated CsCl/PBS solution (1.24 g/mL) (total volume 12.7 mL).\nTransfer the AAV vector solution to a quick-seal tube using a Pasteur pipette.\nAdd saturated CsCl/PBS solution into the tube until the surface reaches the tube’s hole neck, and then check the balance.\nSeal the tube top using a heat-sealer.\nCentrifuge in a Beckman NVT 65 rotor at 287,000 × g (55,000 rpm) for 24 h at 16°C.\nNote: After ultracentrifugation, carefully carry the rotor to avoid collapsing the gradient.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3088_11.csv\nInsert a 22-gauge needle into the top of the tube for venting, and another 22-gauge needle into the bottom of the tube.\nCollect approximately 1.0 mL of drop solution from the bottom into a 1.5 mL tube (1–10 fractions).\nPool the fractions containing vector particles to a thinwall polypropylene tube and balance with CsCl/PBS solution (0.55 g/mL).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3088_12.csv\nNote: In our protocol, the second to sixth fractions usually contain vector particles.

    "Here we describe how to prepare the surgical supplies, stereotaxic instruments, and glass micropipettes, and mention the method for stereotactic injection of AAV vector solution into the striatum of the wild-type (Long Evans) and parvalbumin (PV)-Cre knockin rats, in which Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the PV gene promoter. AAV vectors were introduced into the striatum (4 sites), and the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML), and dorsoventral (DV) coordinates (mm) from bregma and dura were 1.5/3.0/3.0 (site 1), 1.5/3.0/3.5 (site 2), 0.5/3.0/3.0 (site 3), and 0.5/3.0/3.5 (site 4) according to an atlas of the rat brain.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] A set of stereotaxic injection into the rat brain is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3088-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Intracranial injection of AAV vectors\n(A) Overall view of AAV vector injection into the rat brain. A deeply anesthetized rat is placed in a stereotaxic instrument to inject AAV vector solution into the brain region. 1) isoflurane anesthesia apparatus; 2) stereotaxic instrument; 3) microinfusion pump, and 4) micropipette manipulator.\n(B) Injection of AAV vector solution is performed by inserting the glass micropipette into the brain region according to the coordinates from bregma and dura.\nSterilize surgical instruments and supplies such as forceps, fine scissors, and swabs by using an autoclave.\nSterilize the surgical area with a sterilizing disinfectant.\nPrepare the glass micropipettes (10 cm in length, 1.0 mm in outer diameter, 0.75 mm in inner diameter) for vector injection.\nPull borosilicate glass capillary using a micropipette puller (Model PC-10, NARISHIGE). The parameter of a pulling program is: Step1, Level at 65.\nCut the pipette tip with scissors (outer diameter of the tip: 12–14 μm).\nApply the anesthesia to a rat and fix the head in a stereotaxic instrument.",

The dura mater is often punctured during drilling. If not, the mater is ruptured with a 25-gauge needle tip. Be careful not to damage the brain parenchyma.\nCritical: Bleeding may occur when puncturing the skull. In this case, stop the bleeding by pressing the hole with a small cotton swab dipped in sterile, cold PBS. Bone debris and excess blood should be washed away.
