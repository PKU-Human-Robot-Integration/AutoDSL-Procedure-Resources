Add 2 mL EDTA/PBS and incubate the cells at 37°C for 3 min.\nCritical: Extended exposure (> 10 min) to EDTA/PBS will decrease cell viability and differentiation potential when you passage hiPSCs.\nAspirate the EDTA/PBS and add 2 mL Stem Fit AK02N. Dissociate the cells into single cells by gentle pipetting.\nAfter cell counting, replate the cells at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates and add 2 mL Stem Fit AK02N medium containing 10 μΜ Y-27632 and 0.125 μg/cm2 iMatrix-511 silk.\nNote: We recommend that maintenance medium for hiPSCs be Stem Fit AK02N or AK03N (Ajinomoto) because the induction efficiency of UB lineage cells may be decrease with hiPSCs maintained in other media, such as Essential 8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nNote: We add iMatrix-511 silk to the medium to coat the plate at passaging. You may precoat the plate with iMatrix-511 silk at 37°C for 1 h; however, this is a time-consuming process (Miyazaki et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCritical: Adding ROCK inhibitor is important to prevent hiPSC apoptosis at passaging.\nPreparation of hiPSCs for differentiation\nTiming: 1 day for pre-differentiation\nThis section describes the preparation culture of hiPSCs before differentiation.\nPre-differentiation.\nPrepare the hiPSC suspension at passaging.\nAfter cell counting, replate the cells at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 and add Stem Fit AK02N medium containing 10 μΜ Y-27632 and 0.125 μg/cm2 iMatrix-511 silk.",
    "Note: hiPSCs will be 30%–40% confluency during pre-differentiation.\nCritical: Both confluency and the size of the initial hiPSC colonies should be considered to avoid spontaneous differentiation.\nNote: We use two wells of a 4-well culture plate, and the medium volume is 500 μL for a regular differentiation experiment. Other plate formats, such as 24-well plates, can be used alternatively.\nCritical: Adding ROCK inhibitor to the medium is important to prevent apoptosis at pre-differentiation.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 24 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1739-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

(2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nNote: Incubate the cells with EDTA/PBS until the cells have clearly defined bright edges under a brightfield microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The differentiation efficiency might decrease if the cells are treated with EDTA/PBS for >5 min or too short.\nNote: We recommend that the maintenance medium for hiPSCs be Stem Fit AK02N or AK03N (Ajinomoto) because the induction efficiency of UB lineage cells may decrease with hiPSCs maintained in other media, such as Essential 8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nNephric duct cell induction in 2D culture\nTiming: 16–28 h for APS induction, 3 days for AIM induction and 2 days for ND elongation\nThis section describes the induction of nephric duct (ND) cells through APS and AIM steps.\nAPS induction (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPrepare 1 mL APS medium for two wells of a 4-well plate before starting this step.\nAfter 1 day of pre-differentiation with StemFit AK02N, wash the cells with 500 μL PBS and add 500 μL APS medium per well.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 16–28 h.\nNote: You may need to optimize the incubation time depending on the hiPSC lines. To confirm APS induction, we recommend bright field microscopic observations and immunostaining analysis. Refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAIM induction (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPrepare 3 mL AIM medium before starting this step.",
    "After 16–28 h of APS induction, wash the cells with 500 μL PBS, add 1 mL AIM medium per well and incubate at 37°C for 2 days without changing the medium.\nAfter 2 days, coat the 24-well plates with 300 μL Geltrex per well and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nNote: Geltrex is ready-to-use and stored at 4°C until the expiry date indicated on the label. Coat new 24-well plates with undiluted Geltrex. You can use Matrigel alternatively.\nAspirate the AIM medium and wash the cells with 500 μL PBS.\nAdd 300 μL Accutase per well and incubate the cells at 37°C for 3 min.\nCritical: Extended exposure (>3 min) to Accutase will lead to decreased cell viability.\nDetach the cells from the plates and dissociate them into single cells by manual pipetting about ten times.\nCollect all cell suspensions from all wells in a 15-mL tube and add DMEM/10% FBS up to 1.5 mL/well in the 4-well plates to stop the Accutase activity.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200×g for 5 min and aspirate the medium.\nAfter cell counting, replate the cells at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/cm2 in a Geltrex-coated 24-well plate with 500 μL AIM medium containing 10 μΜ Y-27632 and incubate at 37°C for an additional 24 h.\nNote: Immunostaining analysis for GATA3, LHX1 and PAX2 can be performed to confirm AIM induction 72 h later. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). AIM cells co-express these three markers.\nND elongation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPrepare 2 mL ND medium to correspond to two wells of a 24-well plate before starting this step.\nWash the AIM cells with 500 μL PBS and add 1 mL ND medium per well of the 24-well plate.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 2 days without a medium change.",
    "Note: Immunostaining analysis for RET can be performed to confirm ND elongation cell induction. ND elongation cells co-express RET and GATA3 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\niUB organoid induction in 3D culture\nTiming: 2 days for ND epithelialization and 6 days for iUB organoid induction\nTiming: 6 days for the reconstitution of iUB organoids\nThis section describes the induction of iUB organoids through ND epithelialization step and reconstitution of iUB organoids from separated tip regions of iUB organoids.\nND epithelialization (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPrepare 2 mL ND medium for 20 wells of a 96-well plate before starting this step.\nWash the ND cells with 500 μL PBS per well and then aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 300 μL Accutase per well and incubate at 37°C for 3 min.\nDetach the cells from the plates and dissociate them into single cells by manual pipetting about ten times.\nCollect all cell suspensions in a 15-mL tube and add DMEM/10% FBS up to 1.5 mL/well in the 24-well plates to stop the Accutase activity.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200×g for 5 min and aspirate the medium.\nNote: You can cryopreserve these cells at a density of up to 2 × 106 cells/mL with STEMCELL BANKER.\nAfter resuspending the cells in ND medium and cell counting, seed the cells at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in low-attachment M-bottom 96-well plates with 100 μL ND medium plus 10 μM Y-27632 and incubate the cells at 37°C for an additional 2 days without a medium change.\nNote: After two days, one ND aggregate including unwanted cells is formed per one well of 96-well culture plates.\niUB organoid induction (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPrepare 2 mL UB organoid medium for 20 wells of a 96-well plate before starting this step.",
    "Separate unwanted cells from ND aggregates by manual pipetting 10–20 times using a 10- or 200-μL pipette (Mae et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: Unwanted cells are not UB lineage and arise in the process of UB differentiation because the induction rate of ND cells is not 100%. We recommend separating these unwanted cells to purify ND cells. The ND cell region is larger and harder than unwanted regions in one aggregate per well (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: If unwanted cells cannot be separated from the ND aggregate, reinduce the ND cells from hiPSCs by improving the APS induction step. Refer to troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAspirate ND medium and add 100 μL organoid medium per well to the same 96-well plates.\nIncubate the aggregates at 37°C for 6 days. Organoid medium is changed every two days to generate iUB organoids (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G–1I).\nNote: iUB organoids will be floating in the well. One iUB organoid is formed per well of the 96-well plates.\nCritical: Excessive pipetting (over 30 times) will break ND aggregates and may decrease UB budding.\nNote: M-bottom 96-well plates with spindle-shaped bottoms are recommended to generate iUB organoids. It is difficult to generate ND cell aggregates with U-bottom 96-well plates and to observe cell aggregates by microscopy with V-bottom 96-well plates.\nNote: You may centrifuge M-bottom 96-well plates containing ND cells at 200×g for 2 min to promote the cell aggregate formation.\nNote: The induction rate of iUB organoids may be low if the budding regions of iUB organoids are reduced and/or thickened. Refer to troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAdditional: Reconstitution of iUB organoids from separated tip regions of iUB organoids.\nPrepare 2 mL UB organoid medium before starting this step.\nMove some iUB organoids to a 35-mm dish (Sumitomo Bakelite) with 2 mL Essential 6 medium.",
    "Prepare two 22G needles (Terumo, # NN-2225R) and a stereomicroscope.\nManually separate the UB tip regions from iUB organoids with two needles using a stereomicroscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J).\nMove one separated UB tip region into one well of the low-attachment M-bottom 96-well plates and add 100 μL UB organoid medium per well.\nIncubate the aggregate at 37°C for 14 days. Organoid medium is changed every two days to generate iUB organoids (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K).\nNote: This reconstitution process can be repeated 3–4 times for each tip.\n2D-CDP induction\nTiming: 7 days for UB tip colony induction and 7 days for CDP induction\nThis section describes the induction of CDPs in 2D culture from iUB organoids through UB tip colonies.\nUB tip colony induction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1739-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bars, 100 μm. (D) and (F) are adapted from Mae et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nPrepare 600 μL UB tip medium for two wells of a 48-well plate before starting this step.\nCoat the 48-well plate with 150 μL/well hydrogel.\nNote: Keep Matrigel and hydrogel on ice to prevent them from solidifying before use. For details, refer to materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nIncubate the plate to solidify the hydrogel at 37°C for 1 h.\nCollect 10 day 6 iUB organoids in a 1.5 mL tube.\nWash the organoids with 500 μL PBS twice.",
    "Aspirate PBS and add 100 μL Accutase. Incubate at 37°C for 5 min.\nAdd 900 μL DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and dissociate the organoids by manual pipetting about 30 times.\nCentrifuge the cells at 200×g for 5 min and aspirate the medium.\nAfter resuspending the cells in 100 μL UB tip medium and cell counting, seed the cells at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in 48-well plates and add UB tip medium up to 300 μL per well.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 7 days. Change the medium every two days.\nNote: After 7 days, 500–1,000 tip colonies 80–100 μm in diameter will be formed per well.\nNote: Immunostaining analysis for RET and GATA3 will help confirm the tip colony induction (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). Tip colonies co-express these markers.\nNote: If UB tip colonies cannot be formed, refer to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\n2D-CDP induction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nPrepare 1 mL CDP medium for two wells of a 24-well plate before starting this step.\nAspirate the medium of day 7 UB tip colonies in 48-well plates (see 8. UB tip colony induction of step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details]) and add 300 μL Cell Recovery Solution per well.\nIncubate the plate at 4°C for 1 h to dissolve hydrogel containing 50% Matrigel.\nCollect all cell suspension from the four wells of the 48-well plates into a 1.5 mL tube, centrifuge the colonies at 500×g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nNote: If the hydrogel remains around the UB tip colonies, we recommend adding 1 mL Cell Recovery Solution to the 1.5 mL tube after aspirating the supernatant. Pipet gently three to four times and incubate the cells at 4°C for an additional 1 h.",

You may precoat the plate with iMatrix-511 silk at 37°C for 1 h; however, this is a time-consuming process (Miyazaki et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].).\nIncubate the cells at 37°C for 7 days. Change CDP medium every two days.\nNote: Immunostaining analysis for FOXA1 and AQP2 will help confirm CDP induction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).
