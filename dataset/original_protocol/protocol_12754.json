    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Georgetown University.\n1. Generation of the Fluorescent Reporter Strain\nDigest the genome integrative pRB4 vector sequentially with EcoRI and SmaI restriction enzymes. Following the manufacturer's protocol, set up an overnight digestion with SmaI using 1 µg of pRB4 at 25 °C, and then proceed with the second digestion for 1h at 37 °C by adding EcoRI to the reaction mixture. Inactivate the enzymes by incubating at 65 °C for 20 min.\nPCR amplify the regulatory region of interest from genomic DNA (in this case, a ~350 base pair DNA fragment containing the thermonuclease [nuc] promoter region), incorporating a 5' EcoRI restriction site and a 3' SmaI restriction site. The SmaI recognition sequence must be in-frame with the translational start codon. In this study, the PCR was performed using a high-fidelity DNA Polymerase according to the manufacturer's recommendations with forward primer oRB015 (5'-atcattgaattctccaaagtaaattataagttatac-3') and reverse primer oRB016 (5'-gggcataactaacacctctttctttttag-3'). The annealing temperature was 53 °C. Purify the resulting fragment using a PCR clean-up kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nDigest the resulting PCR product with EcoRI and SmaI as performed in step 1.1 and ligate the digested DNA fragment to the same sites of pRB4 using T4 DNA ligase as recommended by the manufacturer to generate the integrative construct. Introduce the ligation mixture into E. coli and confirm construct sequence.",
    "Electroporate the construct into S. aureus strain RN4220 as previously described34. In brief, use 1 µg of plasmid with 70 µL of electro-competent cells (100 Ω, 25 µF, and 2.3 kV) in B2 broth (1% [w/v] Casein hydrolysate, 2.5% [w/v] Yeast extract, 2.5% [w/v] NaCl, 0.1% [w/v] K2PO4, 0.5% [w/v] Glucose). Select for erythromycin resistance (Emr) at the permissive temperature (30 °C) on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with erythromycin (5 µg mL-1) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal; 80 µg mL-1). The resulting transformants are blue due to plasmid-encoded β-galactosidase activity.\nNOTE: Transfer of DNA into clinical isolates is extremely difficult due to a strong restriction-modification barrier35. Thus, S. aureus RN4220 was used as an intermediate recipient of the fusion construct because it is restriction deficient and highly transformable.\nTransfer plasmid to S. aureus USA300 strain of interest using electroporation or phage-mediated transduction36 at the permissive temperature. In brief, propagate Φ11 bacteriophage particles on the donor strain using TSA plates containing 5 mM CaCl2 overnight at 30 °C, and then sterilize by filtration through a 0.45 µM cellulose acetate syringe filter. Use lysates to transduce S. aureus strain LAC to Emr.\nNOTE: LAC is a widely used clinical isolate that was previously made Em sensitive by serial passage in TSB medium to cure the strain of the native plasmid pUSA03 that confers Emr 37,38.\nIntegrate the construct by two, successive homologous recombination events into the chromosome as described previously32. The recombinants are chloramphenicol-resistant (Cmr) on TSA plates containing 5 μg mL-1 of chloramphenicol, erythromycin-susceptible (Erms), and no longer blue.\n\tNOTE: When possible, re-introduce the marked fusion into USA300 via phage-mediated transduction to avoid the accumulation of mutations associated with in vitro strain passage39 and temperature shifts.\n2. Animal Infection: Preparation of the Inoculum, Systemic Infection, and Tissue Processing\nPreparation of bacterial inoculum",
    "Streak S. aureus strains of interest for isolation on blood agar plates from a frozen glycerol stock. Incubate at 37 °C for 16–24 h to confirm hemolytic phenotypes based on their ability to lyse red blood cells (RBCs) and form clear transparent zones.\nInitiate overnight cultures by inoculating single colonies of each strain to 4 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) in sterile glass tubes. Rotate the tubes at 37 °C for 16–24 h in a tube roller set at approximately a 70° angle and 70 rotations per minute [RPM].\nUse a spectrophotometer to measure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the cultures from step 2.1.2. Use sterile medium as an optical reference (blank). Dilute these cells to an OD600 of 0.05 in 25 mL of sterile Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) in separate, 125 mL DeLong flasks (5:1 flask to volume ratio) and incubate cultures in a water bath (for proper heat transfer to the cultures), shaking at 280 RPM and set to 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Growth of the inoculum can be performed in various ways; one method for growing cells to exponential phase is presented. Regardless, it is important to consistently use the same method for preparing the cells for inoculation.\nAt an OD600 of ~1, re-dilute the cells into fresh medium to a starting OD600 of 0.05 to ensure the cells achieve exponential phase and that factors that accumulate during overnight incubation have been reduced to exponential phase levels.\nHarvest the cells during exponential phase (OD600 ~0.6–0.8) by centrifuging at 3,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash the pellets twice in equivalent volume of sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4).",
    "Suspend the cells in 1x PBS (pH 7.4) to a concentration of 1 x 108 colony forming units (CFUs) mL-1 or as appropriate for the desired experiment.\nNOTE: it is important to determine the relationship between OD600 and CFU mL-1 for each strain of interest because strain-dependent alterations of cell size and shape can affect light scattering properties and ultimately, the infection dose.\nPreparation of the animals and bacterial infection\nAcclimate mice for 7 days on purified diet AIN-93. The diet is formulated to provide adequate nutrition while reducing tissue auto-fluorescence associated with the consumption of plant-based ingredients used in standard mouse chow40.\nNOTE: Female C57/BL6 mice (6-8 weeks old) are used here, but the mouse strain and sex will depend on the study.\nBefore infection, dilate mouse tail veins with lukewarm water.\nInfect animals by injecting 100 µL of the bacterial inoculum via tail-veins to produce a systemic infection. Save an aliquot of the initial inoculum if performing flow cytometry (see Section 4).\nMonitor animals daily and evaluate their health status using a monitoring system reviewed and approved by one's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nAllow the infection to progress for the desired duration. Here, the experiments are terminated 3 days post-infection.\nNOTE: Under these conditions, abscesses consist of a staphylococcal abscess community of bacteria, enclosed by fibrin deposits, and surrounded by concentric layers of immune cells5,41.\nHarvesting the organs and tissue processing\nEuthanize the animals by CO2 inhalation and cervical dislocation as a secondary method and perform necropsy.\nHarvest kidney (right) and other vital organs (heart, liver, lungs, spleen) and transfer into 15 mL polypropylene tubes containing 10% [v/v] buffered formalin. Proceed with these organs to step 2.3.4 below.",
    "Transfer the left kidney to a sterile 2 mL impact-resistant tube containing ~500 µL of 2 mm silica beads and 1 mL sterile 1x PBS (pH 7.4). Proceed with this organ to step 4.2.\nAllow organs from step 2.3.2 to fix in the dark at room temperature with gentle shaking or rotation for at least 24 hours but no more than 48 hours.\nEmbed organs in clear tissue freezing medium and store the tissues at -80 °C.\nUsing a cryostat, section tissue into slices of 10 µm thickness.\nDry the sections on a pre-cleaned, charged glass slide for 20 min in darkness, apply hard mounting medium with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain, and apply coverslip. Cure mounted slides at room temperature overnight, and transfer to 4 °C for long-term storage.\n3. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy and Image Processing\nExamine mounted slides to locate lesions using lasers appropriate for the fluorescent reporter being used. In this case, the green (GFP), red (tdTomato), and blue (DAPI) fluorescence signals are used.\nAcquire the image using the appropriate objective for visualizing individual cells (e.g., typically 20x or 40x objectives are used).\nMeasure the fluorescence intensities in the confocal images.\nOpen the confocal image in Image J and adjust brightness/contrast to properly visualize the fluorescence signal of the lesion.\nDefine the region of interest, and by using the Thresholding option, set the lower and upper fluorescence limits as necessary.\nDefine the centroid by selecting Area → Mean gray value → Centroid → Limit to Threshold under the Analyze tab in Image J. \nExtract centroid fluorescence intensity value or measure the mean fluorescence intensity in a given lesion per unit area (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) for GFP and tdTomato. Here, areas of one µm2 were used.",
    "NOTE: A blinded second analysis minimizes bias when the identity of the sample is known.\nPlot the data and perform the appropriate statistical analyses for each comparison.\n4. Flow Cytometry Analysis\n(Optional) Determine fusion activity of the inoculum on the day of the infection (from section 2.2.3)\nTo 899 µL of 1x sterile PBS (pH 7.4) add 100 µL of each inoculum and 1 µL of membrane permeant nucleic acid stain (see Table of Materials). As a control, be sure to include a sample lacking nucleic acid stain.\nPerform flow cytometry on all samples.\nNOTE: For the very first experiment, it is useful to include a vector only control for the fusion of interest to determine the proper voltage to use. A clear separation between positive and negative samples is essential for data analysis, indicating the reporter is well above background signal.\nTo identify the bacterial population, plot events using nucleic acid stain (y-axis) and forward scatter (x-axis).\nDraw an inclusion gate around events that are both nucleic acid stain positive and the correct size of the bacterium based on the forward scatter (between 0.5 to 2.0 µm for S. aureus).\nNOTE: Be rigorous when identifying this population as it is critical to include events that are clearly within these parameters. Be sure this gate excludes all events for the negative controls under other conditions. In this study, roughly 70% the cell population met these requirements in the analysis.\nAnalysis of tissue samples after sacrifice:\nEuthanize the animals, harvest the left kidneys (see step 2.3), and transfer into bead-beating tubes containing 1 mL of 1x sterile PBS (pH 7.4) and 250 µL of 2 mm borosilicate beads.",
    "Disrupt tissues to release bacterial cells. For kidneys, use a homogenizer to disrupt cells. Here, three 30 s bursts at 6800 rpm with 1 min cooling periods on wet ice between cycles were used to minimize heating samples.\nPellet the larger tissue debris by centrifuging at 250 x g for 3 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge cooled to 4 °C.\nNOTE: Typically, there is a cell pellet at the bottom of the tube and a layer of floating debris on the top. The middle aqueous layer contains the bacterial cells.\nTransfer 10 µL from the aqueous layer into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 1 µL of nucleic acid stain in 989 µL of PBS (total volume 1 mL).\nPerform flow cytometry using the same data acquisition parameters and gating as for the initial inocula.\nNOTE: Bacterial cell counts will be very low because the sample mainly contains tissue debris. The \"Live gate\" option can also be used if the cells are nucleic acid stain positive and size-gated when data are loaded into the application. This will also help to analyze more of the target events and reduce file size. Nearly one million events per sample are counted, but more event counts may be necessary depending on the severity of the infection and size of tissue analyzed.\nData Analysis: Determine mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for each fluorophore in a given sample using the inclusion gates determined in section 4.1.4. Normalize samples in flow analysis software to event counts. 10,000 counts are usually sufficient in the analysis.\nNOTE: It is not uncommon to find samples that contain less than this number of events since this is dependent on abscess formation and infection severity. Using this approach, 500-40,000 events are typically found in infected tissue.",
