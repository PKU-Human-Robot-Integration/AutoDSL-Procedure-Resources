    "1. Preparation of the Sample\nUse a needle to remove some of the sample from the sample container.*\nUse the needle to fill the capillary (maximum diameter of 2.2 mm) with sample. The capillary must be filled between 2 and 3 cm from the bottom.\nClose the capillary by melting wax on its tip.\nUnscrew the vacuum sample holder from the system.\nTake the capillary by the fused end (wax end) and insert the un-fused end into the sample holder.\nPlace the holder back into the system and screw in place.\n* Solid samples (including powder samples) can be directly placed in the sample holder (no capillary necessary), whereas liquid samples must be placed in a capillary.\nStart-Up of the SWAXS Machine\n2. Source Cold Startup Procedure\nClose the shutter by pushing the safety shutter button.\nSwitch the main power \"ON\" by pushing the green on button.\nVerify the Emergency \"Shut-Off\" button is in the extended position.\nSwitch the main power on by pushing the green button.\nVerify the interlock LED light is green, indicating all interlocks are ok.\nWait for the touch screen to load. Once it has loaded, press \"R6\" on the menu.\nTurn the Standby key to the \"ON\" position.\nTurn the X-ray Key to the \"ON\" position. The red X-ray light should light up.\nWait for the touch screen to read standby levels (30 kV and 0.4 mA).\nTurn the Standby Safety Key to the \"OFF\" position. Press the \"Start Cycle\" button on bottom of the touch screen.\nWait for the touch screen to read nominal power (50 kV and 1 mA). If a different power level is desired, enter the configuration screen by pressing \"R4\" on the touch screen and entering the desired settings.\n3. Chiller Procedure",
    "Turn the power switch to the \"ON\" position on the temperature control panel. A control light and the LED temperature display will light up.\nTurn the power switch to the \"ON\" position on the chiller.\nWait until the temperature display reads \"OFF.\" This is standby mode.\nPress and hold the enter button (return symbol) for about 4 sec or until the temperature display indicates an actual temperature.\nTo change the temperature, press the up or down arrows. The set value will be shown on the temperature display for approximately 8 sec before it will return to the actual value.\nPress the enter button once the desired set value is displayed. This will store that value.\nWait until the actual temperature reaches the desired set value.\nNOTE: If at any time the error \"E 01\" shows up on the temperature display, follow the Chiller Shutdown instructions, refill the bath unit by pouring purified water into the tank fill, and then perform the chiller Startup procedure again.\n4. Shutdown of Chiller\nPress \"enter\" for approximately 4 sec.\nTurn the power switch to the \"OFF\" position.\n5. Turning on the Vacuum\nEnsure the vacuum door is secured in place.\nTurn the Vacuum 1 and 2 knobs to the \"ON\" positions.\nWait until the VAP5 vacuum gauge reads a vacuum level less than 1.5 mbar.\n6. Detector System Setup\nTo set up the gas pressure, verify the Main Pressure Gauge of the reduction valve is at least 10 bar.\nOpen the Main Valve.\nSlowly open the Operating Pressure Valve until the pressure reaches 8 bar at the Operating Pressure Gauge.\nOpen the Second Main Valve\nTo adjust gas flow, open the Main Pressure valve by turning the knob to the vertical position on the Gas Control panel.",
    "Adjust the flow rate with the needle valve until the gauge reads approximately 8 bar.\nTurn the Main Power switch to the \"ON\" position. The LED light should light up.\nTo adjust the high voltage, activate the high voltage by turning the switch to the \"ON\" position. The LED light should light up.\nSlowly turn the voltage control knob until approximately 3.5kV is reached on the gauge. DO NOT EXCEED 4kV.\n7. Calibration\nThe experimental steps above are performed with a sample of known peaks.\nASA 3.3 is used to obtain graph of intensity vs. channel with 5 peaks.\nGo to Menu →Options→Enter channels and corresponding intensities.\nGo to ASA3, \"TPF\" tab first.\nChange filter, top left 1 mm Nickel (beam filter).\nSet position 32,000 (range 28,000 to 32,000, critical region around 28,000) → go to position, make sure vacuum is below 5 mbar, make sure the detector is reading between 1k -10K.\nRun for 10 sec for approximately 52 counts per sec.\nChange the energy windows, (or measure the energy window with the sample only, not including the filter case). Set the final run for 10 sec.\nFind the location of the primary beam (channel 233 for example).\nFor other runs, change filter again to 2 mm Tungsten (W, beam stopper) and start from 30,000.\nFind the location of all other peaks of the samples.\nUse ImageJ-macro software to calibrate SAXS - making transitions from intensity vs. channel to intensity vs. q (or d spacing) (Figure 1).\nUse ImageJ-macro software to calibrate WAXS - making transitions from intensity vs. channel to intensity vs. q (or d spacing) (Figure 2).\n8. Software Procedure\nUse the software ASA 3.3, to collect the live data: Live Data→ TPF tab→ Save file.\nFor EasySWAXS, click on the Device Settings tab.",
    "Enter the \"a\", lambda, and d values, as well as the center of gravity.\nSelect Point Collimation.\nSelect Globular particle type (unless it is a known to be a rod of flat shaped particle).\nClick on the Guinier-Plot tab. An I vs. q2 graph will be displayed.\nDrag the vertical lines to surround a section of approximately linear slope.\nAt the bottom of the screen, an R value will be displayed. Next to this there is a validation requirement.\nContinue to drag the vertical lines closer together until the validation value is between 1 and 2. This is subjective. The R value, or Radius of Gyration, obtained is an estimate.\n9. Source Shutdown Procedure\nVerify the safety and fast shutters are closed.\nTurn the Standby key to the \"ON\" position.\nWait for the touchscreen to read standby levels.\nPress R5 on the touchscreen.\nReduce the current to 0 A.\nReduce the voltage to 0 A.\nTurn the X-ray key to the \"OFF\" position.\nSwitch the main power \"OFF\" by pushing the red off button.\nSubscription Required.
