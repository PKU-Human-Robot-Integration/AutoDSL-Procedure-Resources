In this protocol, we used Human LOX-1 (GeneBank NM002543) and Human AT1R (GenBank NM_000685) as receptors of interest. LOX-1 tagged with V5-6×His at the C-terminus (V5-LOX-1) was subcloned into the EcoRI/EcoRV site of pmScarlet_C1 (Plasmid #85042, Addgene) (mScarlet-LOX-1), fluorophores located at N terminal. HA-FLAG-hAT1 was subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI site of pcDNA3-EGFP (Plasmid #85042, Addgene) (hAT1-EGFP), fluorophores located at C terminal. In this experiment, fluorophores were inserted into the intracellular regions of LOX-1 and AT1.\nNote: Whether to place the fluorophore at the C- or N-terminal end of the receptor to be labeled must be based on an understanding of the characteristics of the receptor and its intracellular or extracellular localization.\nPreparation of the samples for the imaging experiment\nTiming: 2–5 days\nThis step includes cell culture, preparation and transfection by electroporation.\nDefrost cells.\nFirstly, defrost one CHO-K1 stock from liquid nitrogen under 37°C water bath 3 min, then equally split cells liquid into two 10 cm dishes containing 10 mL Cell culture medium (medium+10%FBS+1%antibiotic) and culture in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C 12 h. If cultured cells are obtainable, you can skip this step.\nCell passage.\nEach 35 mm glass coverslip bottom dish is pre-coated with 200 μL 10 mg/mL Poly-L-Lysine (1:1000) diluted in ultrapure distilled water at a 37°C incubator for an hour.\nWash each 35 mm glass base dish with 200 μL 37°C PBS three times.",
    "Bring the cells in two 10 cm dishes from incubator, wash each 10 cm dish with 2 mL 37°C HBSS once, then add 2 mL 37°CTrypsin to detach cells in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 2 min.\nAdd 2 mL 37°CTNS to neutralize Trypsin, then transfer the mixture from each dish to one 50 mL tube, and centrifuge at 210 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\nAspirate supernatant, add 10 mL 37°C Cell culture medium (medium+10%FBS) to suspend cells, count cell number, transfer 5 × 104 cells to each 1.5 mL tube, and centrifuge at 210 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\nElectroporation.\nPlace Neon tube, pipette and tips, buffer R, buffer E and other required experimental tools in a biological safety cabinet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1608-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Pictures in the order shown in the electroporation protocol and SpinSR10 accessory equipment\n(A–L) Electroporation was performed on CHO cell lines with the Neon™ Transfection System (A–G and I). Required experimental buffers and tools in the biological safety cabinet (A). Transfer 400 μL culture medium into pre-prepared 1.5 mL tube (B). Transfer 3 mL buffer E into Neon tube (C). Insert the Neon tube into Neon Pipette Station (D). Aspirate the cell-DNA mixture into 10 μL Neon tip (E). Place the Neon pipette into Neon Pipette Station (F).

Microscope accessory of heating machine (K). Microscope shade plate on push-in position (L).\nSuspend cells (5 × 104 cells) with 10 μL buffer R per 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Add 400 μL Cell culture medium (medium+10%FBS) to another pre-prepared 1.5 mL tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nTurn on the Neon device and enter the electroporation parameters. Our parameters in this experiment were, Pulse voltage 1,560 V, Pulse 5 ms, Pulse number 10, Cell density 5 × 106 cells/mL Transfection efficiency 90%, and tip type 10 μL.\nFill the Neon tube with 3 mL buffer E (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nInsert the Neon tube into the Neon Pipette Station until it “clicks” into place (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nAdd 1.5 μg/35 mm glass coverslip bottom dish AT1-EGFP and 0.5 μg/35 mm glass coverslip bottom dish mScarlet-LOX-1 to the 1.5 mL tube from step b containing cells and mix gently.\nInsert a 10 μL Neon tip into the Neon pipette, then press the push-button on the Neon pipette to the first stop and immerse the Neon tip into the cell-DNA mixture. Slowly release the push-button on the pipette to aspirate the cell-DNA mixture into the Neon tip (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nInsert the Neon pipette with the sample vertically into the Neon tube placed in the Neon Pipette Station until it “clicks” into place, then press Start button on the Neon device touchscreen (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNeon device touchscreen displays “Complete” to indicate that electroporation is complete (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G). Electroporation parameters of CHO-K1 cell line from Neon Transfection System Cell Line Data is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H.\nRemove the Neon pipette from the Neon Pipette Station and immediately transfer the sample mixture from the Neon tip into the prepared 1.5 mL tube from step c containing 400 μL Cell culture medium (medium+10%FBS).\nTransfer 200 μL cell suspension from above 1.5 mL tube into each pre-coated 35 mm glass coverslip bottom dish, incubate in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 12 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I).",
    "Note: Depending on cell types, you need to check the optimal electroporation parameters.\n∗Neon Transfection System Cell Line Data and transfection parameters can be found on the manufacturer’s website.\nhttps://www.thermofisher.com/jp/ja/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-transfection-system/neon-transfection-system-cell-line-data.html[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/jp/ja/home/life-science/cell-culture/transfection/neon-transfection-system/neon-transfection-system-cell-line-data.html].\nCritical: To ensure reproducibility and eliminate variation of the transfection conditions within or between experiments, use each Neon tip only at single time. Discard the used Neon tip into an appropriate biological hazardous waste container.\nNeon Transfection System manual can be found on the manufacturer’s website.\nhttps://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/neon_device_man.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/neon_device_man.pdf].\nNote: It is recommended that experiments be performed with cells in the same condition as much as possible. In our experiments, we defrost the cells after each experiment and use them as soon as their condition is restored, in order to avoid changes in cell properties due to differences in the number of passages and contamination during culture. Cells that have undergone repeated passages are not used.\nNote: Cells should be grown at 80%–90% confluence when you passage the cells.\nNote: The pre-coating of Poly-L-Lysine is used to enhance cell adhesion after electroporation.\nNote: The Neon pipette is used only with Neon tips. Do not use any other tips for the Neon pipette.\nNote: The medium used in electroporation process should not contain antibiotics in order to keep cell viability after electroporation.\nNote: Preliminary experiments are required to determine the optimal transfection ratio of two plasmid vector, in this protocol, we used 1.5 μg/35 mm glass coverslip bottom dish AT1-EGFP and 0.5 μg/35 mm glass coverslip bottom dish mScarlet-LOX-1 to perform transfection.\nNote: In this study, we are performing gene expression by electroporation. Other gene delivery methods, such as viruses, can be used for both in vitro and in vivo experiments (Fus-Kujawa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nSpinning-disk confocal live-cell imaging of receptors in the single cell\nTiming: 10 min",
    "In this part, we describe how to make dynamic recordings of the above transfected cells under super-resolution microscopy.\nWash the sample dish three times with pre-warmed 37°C 900 μL/35 mm glass coverslip bottom dish imaging buffer and keep 900 μL/35 mm glass coverslip bottom dish to the sample dish before microscopic observation is initiated.\nTo start operating the super-resolution microscope, ensure a secure connection between the microscope and the PC software cellSens Dimension 1.11 (Olympus, Japan) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J).\nTurn on the 488 nm (green) and 561 nm (red) laser channels at 20% power, and subsequently adjust the laser power according to the image brightness. Set the film recording time to a total of 5 min, 60 cycles, and 5 s interval. Turn on the auto focus.\nAdd a drop of lens oil to the 100× NA 1.49 objective, then place the sample dish on it, fix the dish with the matching clamp, and turn on the heater provided by the manufacturer (STX Series Stage Top Incubator System, Tokai Hit, Japan) to keep the sample at ambient temperature at 37°C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K).\nUnder the EYE1DIC (Differential Interference Contrast) mode, adjust the focus to obtain clear images of the cells, then switch the channel to EYE2-G (green channel) or EYE3-R (red channel) to check the fluorescence expression and seek the best target single cell.\nAfter selecting the cell area, click “Start” to initiate image recording and add 100 μL of stimulus (1/10 final concentration diluted by imaging buffer, imaging buffer and oxLDL are used as vehicle and stimulus respectively in this protocol) or vehicle to the sample dish just after a 1-min image has been captured.",
    "Green and red channels, and the backgrounds of the two channels are subtracted using the 3D deconvolution algorithm of cellSens Dimension 1.11, and finally the two processed channels are combined to form the merged image (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1608-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Two receptors internalization triggered by the stimulation\nImaging of CHO-K1 cells co-transfected with mScarlet-LOX-1 and control or AT1-EGFP. Cells were preincubated for 1 min and stimulated. In the current protocol, we use 10 μg/mL oxLDL for stimulation. The imaging of before (0 min) and 3 min after stimulation. The imaging was observed by a confocal super-resolution microscope.\nNote: If there is a problem with the connection between the microscope and the PC, a pop-up appears. At that time, please follow the displayed pop-up.\nNote: Choose and keep the laser settings and microscope configuration consistent between conditions to get high quality quantitative data.\nNote: It is very important to find an optimal visualization of the cell in both the green and red channels. The best cell exhibits clear green and red puncta that are moving temporally. If you cannot find the best cell from the software screen, you can look for them under the microscope eyepiece. Prior to turn on microscope eyepiece mode, make sure the microscope shade plate needs to be on push-in position Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]L).\nNote: Gently add the stimulus to the sample dish without any disturbance or movement of the selected cell area. It might need to cease the imaging cycle for drug addition when focus is altered.",
    "Note: The focus may shift during stimulation. Please stimulate in a gentlemanly manner-slowly push the pipette to release reagent to periphery of dish. In this experiment, we use a microscope with autofocus function, which allows us to obtain stable live images. You can also use a perfusion device as an alternative method.\nNote: If bleach correction is required on the captured image, it should be performed prior to analysis.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.
