    "All animal use conformed to the European Community guidelines and was approved by the local ethics committee (Comité d'éthique en expérimentation animale N° 121) and the Ministry of Higher Education and Research (Ref #02285.03).\n1. Animals and Diets\nRats\nUse male Wistar rats weighing 260 - 320 g, started on a high-fat diet (HFD) at 7 weeks of age.\nDiet\nInduce a diet-induced obesity, with at least 12 preoperative weeks of the HFD. Give the rats free access to water and the HFD.\n\t\tNOTE: The HFD consists of a purified laboratory hypercaloric rodent diet containing 45% fat (see Table of Materials).\nEnsure that the rats are obese at the time of surgery, with a weight between 600 - 800 g.\n2. Material\nSurgical equipment\nAutoclave all surgical instruments before surgery.\nLay out all the surgical instruments needed for the procedure (see Table of Materials).\nPerform the anastomosis under magnifying glasses, using conventional and microsurgical instruments.\nEnsure that the rats are positioned on the warming plate at a temperature of 37 °C and under a heat lamp. Position the isothermal electric board as needed.\nAnesthesia and animal preparation\nAnesthetize the rat with an inhalation of 3% vol isoflurane in air for the induction of the anesthesia in the rodent box.\nTransfer the rat to the warming plate and maintain the anesthesia with the facemask at the same flow rate of 3%. Ensure that the anesthetization is complete by pinching the tail of the animal.\nShave the anterior fur, corresponding to the laparotomy's incision zone, a ~3 cm-wide zone from the xiphoid to the animal pelvis, using an electric razor.\nShave a 3 cm-wide zone on the back of the animal, centered on the neck of the animal. This step facilitates monopolar power conduction.",
    "Spray an alcohol-based disinfectant solution over the operation site.\n3. Surgery\nLaparotomy\nApply alcohol-based local antiseptic on the shaved skin.\nOpen the abdomen with a midline cutaneous incision from the xiphoid process of about 3 cm in length with a scalpel. Open the fascia and the peritoneum along the linea alba with a monopolar scalpel.\nEnsure that the peritoneal cavity is opened on the entire length of the cutaneous incision.\n\t\tExpose the peritoneal cavity with a self-retractor.\nGreater curve and hiatal dissection\nDissect the greater gastric curve from the junction between the glandular and nonglandular stomach to the left side of the abdominal esophagus with surgical scissors.\nProgressively coagulate the gastrosplenic vessels with the monopolar scalpel, in order to fully liberate the great gastric curve to the His angle. Then expose the hiatal area by sectioning of thin ligaments.\nDissect the right side of the abdominal esophagus, preserving the left gastric artery and vagal nerve, using a manual dissector.\nGastric pouch confection\nNonglandular stomach ablation\nApply a 35 mm staple gun (see Table of Materials) at the junction between the glandular and nonglandular stomach to the left side of the gastroesophageal junction. Ensure that the nonglandular stomach is on the right side of the stapler.\nFire the gun and then remove the resected nonglandular stomach.\nGastric pouch\nApply a second stapler using a thoraco-abdominal (TA) device (3 - 3.5 mm) (see Table of Materials), parallel to the first stapling, on the right side of the gastroesophageal junction to exclude the antrum and a part of the body of the stomach.\nEnsure that the result of the two staple lines is a gastric pouch about 0.5 cm wide.\nOAGB\nSmall bowel measurement",
    "Locate the duodenojejunal angle. The proximal jejunum is the small bowel portion located under the medial portion of the colon; it is the only nonmobile part of the small bowel in the rat.\nWith a 5 cm-long tape, manually measure 35 cm from the duodenojejunal angle. Then perform a punctiform enterotomy on the antimesenteric side of the jejunum.\nGastrojejunal anastomosis\nPerform a punctiform gastrotomy with the monopolar scalpel on the greater curve side of the gastric pouch, precisely between the two previous staple lines. If the gastric pouch is not totally empty, perform gentle manual pressure on the gastric pouch to empty it.\nPerform an end-to-side gastrojejunal anastomosis with nontraumatic forceps and a small needle-holder.\nStart the suture with two extremity stitches of 7-0 isotactic polypropylene (see Table of Materials), suturing the two extremities of the gastrotomy with the extremities of the enterotomy.\nThen, with the same threads used for the two extremity stitches, perform two running sutures on each side of the anastomosis. If needed, return the anastomosis to facilitate the maneuver. Ensure the quality of the anastomosis by placing close stitches, at least seven or eight on each side of the anastomosis.\nTake 1 mm-wide serosa in every stitch. Avoid taking any mucosa in the stitch in order to gently bury the enteric and gastric mucosa inside the suture.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The result of this is a terminolateral gastrojejunal anastomosis with a biliopancreatic limb on the left and an alimentary (AL)/CL on the right. Ensure that the anastomosis is permeable with gentle pressure on the gastric pouch.\nClosure and immediate care\nRinse the peritoneal cavity with 0.9% NaCl solution and manually replace the abdominal organs into their physiological positions.",
    "Close the abdominal wall with one running suture of braided polyester suture 2-0 (see Table of Materials) with a classical needle-holder.\nClose the skin with one running suture of polyglactin 910 4-0 (see Table of Materials).\nPerform two parietal injections of lidocaine 1% on each side of the laparotomy. Administer a total dose of 1 mL/kg of lidocaine 1% into the rectus abdominal muscle aponeurosis.\n4. Postoperative Care\nPerform an intramuscular injection of 20,000 units/kg penicillin G.\nPerform a subcutaneous injection of 10 mL of isotonic polyionic solution potassium (2 g of KCl/L, 4 g of NaCl/L, and 50 g of glucose/L). In this injection, it is possible to mix with suitable analgesics such as buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) and meloxicam (2mg/kg).\nPlace the rats in individual cages warmed up by a lamp until they are fully awake.\nFrequently inspect the animals in order to administer postoperative treatment with suitable analgesia and hydration (isotonic polyionic solution).\nInject suitable analgesic, buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) and meloxicam (2 mg/kg), subcutaneously from the immediate postoperative period till day 4, every 12 h.\nKeep the rats with free access to water during day 1. On day 2/3, give them free access to a liquid diet. On day 4, give them ad libitum access to a normal diet.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
