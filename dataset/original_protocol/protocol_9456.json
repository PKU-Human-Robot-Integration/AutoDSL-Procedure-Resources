    "1. Inducing a Phosphene with Stimulation to the Right Occipital Lobe\nIn a dimly lit room, seat the participant in a comfortable position. Have the participant put on a swim cap, provide them with hearing protection, and adjust the cap and ear plugs for comfort. To locate and mark the initial point of stimulation, first identify the inion, and then move ~2cm rostrally and ~2cm laterally (figure 1). Alternatively, a frameless stereotaxic system can be used to position the TMS coil over the targeted cortical region.\nUsing a standard figure-eight (double) TMS coil (70mm), place the center of the coil directly over the location determined in the previous step. The coil should be held tangential to the surface of the scalp and oriented in a medial to lateral orientation with the handle facing away from the midline (figure 2).\nWhen the participant is ready, apply a single pulse at 60% intensity output. Ask the participant to describe any visual sensation they may have perceived. Participants who are naíve to phosphenes may benefit from wearing a blindfold. If no phosphene was reported, reposition the coil and redeliver a pulse. If the participant still does not report a phosphene, continue delivering pulses every 7 to 10 seconds (~ 0.1 Hz), increasing the intensity by 5% after every five attempts until 100% intensity is reached.\nWhen the participant reports a phosphene ask him or her to describe in detail what they perceived including color, shape and location. Note: Phosphenes should appear in the contralateral visual field to the hemisphere that is being stimulated. For example if TMS is applied over the right visual cortex, phosphenes should be perceived in the left visual field. \nWhen phosphenes are reliably reported, mark the location of the coil on the swim cap.",
    "2. Obtaining a Phosphene Threshold Value for the Right Occipital Lobe\nDeliver a series of pulses at the same coil location and orientation as above. Ask the participant to confirm the presence of the induced phosphene. \nDeliver pulses every 7 to 10 seconds (~ 0.1 Hz). Instruct the participant to report, after each pulse, whether a phosphene was perceived using the following criteria: with a \"yes\" an unambiguously perceived phosphene; \"no\" the absence of any visual perception; \"maybe\" if they are not sure. A \"maybe\" response should not be counted as a positive response when determining the threshold value. \nAdjust the stimulation intensity, delivering 10 pulses at each intensity level, until a phosphene threshold is determined. The threshold is defined as the lowest intensity of stimulation at which the participant reports unambiguous phosphenes for at least fifty-percent of delivered pulses.\n3. Using the LTaP  System (Figure 3) to Determining the Size and Location of Phosphenes  at Various Fixation points\nSeat the participant so that the nasion (area between the eyes) is approximately 30cm from the center of the projection screen.\nTo acclimate the participant to the LTaP system, give them the laser pointer and instruct them to practice tracing figures that resemble perceived phosphenes. If the participant needs more practice, you may ask the participant to direct the laser point to indicated locations on the projection screen. When the participant is acquainted with the LTaP system and can accurately draw shapes on the screen, deliver a series of TMS pulses to the location marked in the previous steps sufficient to induce a visible phosphene. Ask the participant to trace or outline the perceived phosphene on the projection screen using the laser pointer.",
    "In the three test conditions the stimulus intensity should be 120% of the determined threshold value. For example, if the determined threshold value is 65%, the stimulus intensity value should be set to 78%. The coil location and orientation are the same as determined and described in the above steps.\nIn the first of the three test conditions, have the participant direct their gaze towards a central fixation point. After delivering a pulse instruct the participant to trace or outline the perceived phosphene using the laser pointer. Deliver a series of pulses sufficient to induce ten phosphenes.\nIn the second test condition, have the participant direct their gaze towards a fixation point that is elevated 45° from the central fixation point. Repeat the protocol as described for the first condition.\nIn the third test condition, have the participant direct their gaze towards a fixation point that is positioned 45° to the right of the central fixation point. Repeat the protocol as described for the first condition.\n4. Data Analysis\nAfter the completion of the study data obtained from the LTaP system can be analyzed. The output of the LTAP system consists of an .xml file including color coded X-Y coordinates with timestamps for each record tracing. Analyze the data in order to detect the shift in phosphene position in reference to shift of gaze. \n5. Representative Results\nWhen the TMS coil is placed over the right hemisphere all phosphenes should be observed in the left visual field. When participants are instructed to look straight ahead, phosphenes are typically located in the lower left visual field. Phosphenes should move in accordance with the shift in visual gaze (either 45° vertically or horizontally from central fixation) (figure 4).",

The LTaP (Laser Tracking and Painting) system. A participant (a) sits in front of a rear projection screen (b). After stimulation by the TMS coil (c), the participant uses a laser pointer (d) to draw the perceived phosphenes on the screen (d). A rear-facing webcam (e) records the laser and feeds it to a computer (f) running the LTaP software. The data is then projected back onto the screen via a rear-facing projector (g).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/1762/1762fig4.jpgFigure 4. Post-processing of the LTaP data.
