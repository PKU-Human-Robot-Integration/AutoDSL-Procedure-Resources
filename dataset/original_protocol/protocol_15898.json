    "This protocol can be used to embed cells grown on polyacrylamide-based hydrogels, which show limited infiltration by hydrophobic compounds such as Epon. The basic protocol describes the fixation and dehydration steps common to both alternate protocols. In our experiments, NIH3T3 cells and primary astrocytes prepared from 1- to 2-day-old newborn mice were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) on coverslips coated with polyacrylamide-based hydrogels and cultured under appropriate conditions (Smith, Newton, Mikulski, & Rybak, 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-bib-0020]; Thome et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-bib-0021]). We used self-prepared gels described by Cretu et al. (2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-bib-0003]) or purchased commercially available gels (SoftslipTM, Cell guidance systems, Cambridge, Great Britain). Following chemical fixation (Helmprobst, Frank, & Stigloher, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-bib-0004]), cells were processed for electron microscopy (Trusal, Baker, & Guzman, 1979[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-bib-0024]).\nMaterials\nCell culture medium, for example, DMEM (Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany; cat. no. 10566016)\nPolyacrylamide-coated commercially available SoftslipTM (Matrigen Petrisoft/Softslip, Cell Guidance Systems, Cambridge, United Kingdom) or self-made polyacrylamide coated coverslips (Cretu et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-bib-0003])\nGlutaraldehyde 25% (SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany, cat. no. 23114.01)\nSörensenbuffer (SB, see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-rec-0001])\nOsmiumtetroxide (Chempur, Karlsruhe, Germany, cat. no. 6051) (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-rec-0002])\nUranylacetate-dihydrate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, cat. no. 1.08473.0025)\nEthanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, cat. no. 32205)\nPropylene oxide (SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany, cat. no. 33715)\nEpon (SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany, cat. no. 21045)\nCell culture dishes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany; cat. no. 664160)\n24-well plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany; cat. no. 657160)\nSilicon embedding chambers for electron microscopy (Plano GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany, cat. no.

    "1. Seed your cells of interest on the hydrogel of choice and incubate them under appropriate conditions. It is beneficial to grow the cells to the maximum cell density desired (confluence) to increase the number of cells in the preparation. If, however, a specific experiment requires a lower cell density, the preparation can be performed with fewer cells.\n2. Upon reaching the desired confluence, fix the cells with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in Sörensenbuffer (SB, see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-rec-0001]) for at least an hour at 4°C.\nAll following steps should be performed at 4°C. All washing steps must be performed very carefully to avoid displacement of the cells from the gel.\n3. Transfer the coverslips into a 24-well plate and wash the samples five times with 1 ml SB for 3 min each.\n4. Postfix the cells with 2% osmiumtetroxide (OsO4) in SB for 90 min.\nOsO4 is highly toxic; strictly follow the supplier's instructions (e.g., safety data sheet [SDS]) when handling this reagent. Further safety instructions are provided in the Reagents and Solutions.\nDuring this step, the gels turn black (SoftslipTM) or milky (self-made polyacrylamide gel).\n5. Wash 5× for 3 min with 1 ml ddH2O.\n6. Prestain the samples overnight with 2% uranylacetate diluted in ddH2O.\nUranylacetate is very toxic; strictly follow supplier instructions when handling it and use a fume hood.\n7. Wash 5× for 3 min with 1 ml ddH2O.\n8. Dehydrate the samples in ascending graded alcohol (30%, 50%, 70%, and 90%) into 100% EtOH with 1 ml at 4°C for 30 min per step on ice.\nBe sure the samples are always immersed in liquid during this step. Dried samples are not suitable for transmission electron microscopy and ultrastructural analysis.",
    "During this procedure, high stiffness gels tend to detach from the coverslips, while most 0.2 kPA hydrogels remain attached. Samples still attached to the coverslip and detached samples are processed differently (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-fig-0001], detached gels: Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-prot-0002]; attached gels: Alternate Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-prot-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7db7010e-01fb-476d-954a-8965777fa1b8/cpz1524-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nWorkflow for Epon embedding of high stiffness hydrogels. The workflow for high stiffness hydrogels depends on whether the gels stayed attached to the glass coverslip or detached from the glass support, shown in light grey.\n9. Transfer the samples to room temperature and wash twice with 100% EtOH.",
    "This protocol describes the embedding of detached hydrogels in Epon and the steps necessary to prepare sections of high stiffness hydrogels.\nMaterials\nSee Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-prot-0001]\n1. Cut the detached hydrogels into pieces, transfer them to a glass vessel, and wash 3 × 30 min with 1 ml propylene oxide.\nPropylene oxide is toxic. Strictly follow supplier instructions when handling and use a fume hood. The samples must be transferred from the 24-well plate to a glass vessel because propylene oxide is incompatible with most plastic dishes. Be sure that the samples do not dry out.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cd892b7e-8747-4904-83af-f9a38ade7e60/cpz1524-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nEpon embedded polyacrylamide gels with high stiffness factor resist sectioning. Cells (black arrowheads) were grown on (A) low (0.2 kPA, black asterisk) and (B) high stiffness polyacrylamide gels (50 kPA, white asterisk). Sectioning of the low stiffness gels caused no problems (A). High stiffness gels in contrast (B) were not well infiltrated by the resin, shattered during sectioning, and subsequently swelled in contact with water which caused wrinkling of the sections (white arrowhead). Scale bar for (A) and (B).\n2. Incubate the samples overnight in 1 ml of a 1:1 Epon:propylene oxide solution.\nLiquid Epon resin penetrated low stiffness hydrogels (0.2 kPA), rendering the specimens suitable for sectioning after polymerization (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-fig-0002]). High stiffness gels, in contrast, were not properly infiltrated by Epon and these specimens could not be sectioned (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-fig-0002]).\n3. Exchange the solution with 500 µl Epon and wash twice with 500 µl Epon for at least 2 hr each.\n4. Transfer the samples to flat silicon embedding chambers for electron microscopy and cover the samples with Epon.\n5. Let the Epon polymerize at 70°C for 48 hr.\n6. Open the Epon blocks with a razor blade until the gel is reached (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-fig-0003]).",
    "Steps 7–9 can be omitted for low stiffness hydrogels, and ultrathin sections can be prepared immediately. These steps are necessary for high stiffness hydrogels.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7d406330-ae92-4ba6-9c7d-4ad263849251/cpz1524-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nPreparation of detached high stiffness hydrogels embedded in epoxy resin. The Epon block is opened with a glass knife or a razorblade and the sample is trimmed (white arrowhead, A). The trimmed surface is indicated by dashed lines. After incubation in water, the swollen gel is removed with a micro-grater (black arrowhead) from the Epon block (B). The generated fissure is then refilled with unpolymerized epoxy resin. After polymerization, the sample can be further processed for electron microscopy via semithin sectioning (C). Note that the gel is almost completely removed using this technique (black arrow).\n7. Incubate the opened block in water for 3 to 5 days to let the gel swell.\n8. Remove the gel carefully with a 25-mm Hedstroem and C-Pilot files micro-grater or toothpick (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-fig-0003]).\nThe removal of the hydrogel must be performed very carefully to preserve the morphology of the cells.\n9. Refill the cavity with fresh Epon and let polymerize for 48 hr at 70°C.\n10. Prepare 60-nm ultrathin sections and follow standard staining protocols for imaging samples in the electron microscope, as described (Reynolds, 1963[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-bib-0016]) (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-fig-0003]).",
    "Low and high stiffness hydrogels still attached to the glass coverslips are handled similarly after dehydration. The samples were embedded as described elsewhere (Trusal et al., 1979[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-bib-0024]).\nMaterials\nSee Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-prot-0001]\n1. Transfer the glass slides to an appropriate glass vessel with the cells on top and wash 3 × 30 min with propylene oxide.\nPropylene oxide is toxic. Strictly follow supplier instructions when handling it and use a fume hood. The samples must be transferred from the 24-well plate to an appropriate glass vessel because propylene oxide is incompatible with most plastic dishes. Be sure that the samples do not dry out.\n2. Incubate the samples overnight in a 1:1 Epon:propylene oxide solution.\n3. Exchange the solution with Epon and wash twice with Epon for at least 2 hr each.\n4. Transfer the glass slide with the cell layer facing downwards on top of an Epon-filled flat silicon embedding chamber and let polymerize for 48 hr and 70°C.\n5. Remove the sample from the silicon embedding chamber and remove the glass slide by freezing the Epon block in liquid nitrogen.\nWear safety goggles to protect your eyes! Make sure that the whole glass slide is removed. The glass slide will crack and can easily be removed from the sample. The samples with the low stiffness hydrogels can now be used directly for ultrathin sectioning, whereas the gel of the high stiffness gels must be removed as described in the next step.\nWhen the procedure is performed properly, the hydrogel and cell layer remain with the epoxy resin (Fig. 4A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e630efe9-a253-4fde-8093-3b5995c0b759/cpz1524-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",
    "Preparation of attached high stiffness hydrogels embedded in epoxy resin. The gel was nearly invisible after removing the glass slide by chilling in liquid nitrogen (A, black arrowhead). After incubation in water, the gel became milky (asterisk) and softened, and carefully was swiped away (B). The cells, which were infiltrated with epoxy resin, were then processed for electron microscopy. A semithin section stained with methylene blue is shown (C).\n6. Incubate in water (we found 10 min sufficient to swell and soften the gel, then remove the high stiffness hydrogel with a wooden toothpick (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-fig-0004]).\n7. Prepare ultrathin sections and follow standard staining protocols for imaging samples in the electron microscope, as described previously (Reynolds, 1963[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-bib-0016]).\nIn Figure 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.524#cpz1524-fig-0004], we show horizontal sections of the cell layer. If cross sections (such as those obtained from the detached gels) are required, the upper part of the Epon block containing the cell layer can be cut off and embedded again in Epon by turning the cell layer by 90°."
