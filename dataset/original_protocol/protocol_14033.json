  "procedures": [
    "All experiments were completed in accordance and compliance with federal regulations and University of California policy and procedures have been approved by the University of California, Riverside IACUC.\n1. Animal\nUse diabetic and obese B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J mice for the chronic wound model. Purchasing options include either heterozygotes for breeding or homozygotes directly for experiments.\nBreed heterozygote males and females to produce offspring. Only a quarter of the litter, statistically, will grow to become diabetic and obese (db/db-/-).\nWean and house db/db-/- mice together with their littermates 3 weeks after birth. Separate db/db-/- mice from their littermates 5 weeks after birth and house with other db/db-/- mice until they are 5-6 months old and can be used for the chronic wound model. During this time, a mature and complex skin microbiome can develop.\n\tNOTE: The db/db-/- mice are easily identified visually from littermates between 3-5 weeks of age. The db/db-/- mice are obese, are diabetic, and will be significantly larger and rounder than the wild type and heterozygous littermates. Their abdomen may appear slightly pinker and their hips larger. Increased weight should be confirmed prior to surgery. Also, it is possible to measure high levels of glucose in the blood and genotype the mouse to confirm the mutation in the leptin receptor.\n2. Vivarium and Husbandry\nHouse db/db-/- mice in a conventional vivarium (not a barrier/specific pathogen free facility) so that a microflora can be established on the skin of db/db-/- mice. To specifically model humans who suffer from chronic wounds, do not take special precautions to prevent exposure to pathogens.\nProtect the cages with micro isolator tops to minimize spread of infection within the vivarium. Change cages twice a week with new bedding and feed the mice with regular vivarium chow. Do not autoclave either the bedding or the food.",
    "Set room temperature to range between 21 and 24 °C, with minor fluctuations depending on the time of year. The humidity, reflective of the climate and location, will range between 19 and 70%.\n3. Requirements for the Development of Chronic Wounds\nUse only male and female mice that are phenotypically obese, diabetic, and at least 5-6 months of age for the development of chronic wounds. The weight of these mice should vary between 40-80 g, averaging around 60 g.\nDo not use mice that are considered obese but weigh less than 50 g.\n\tNOTE: All mice referred to in this protocol pass the qualifications described here unless otherwise noted.\n4. Shaving and Application of Depilatory Lotion\nNOTE: Remove unwanted hair on the dorsum of the mouse before wounding. The following procedure is done on live db/db-/- mice that are not under anesthesia the day before surgery. Take precautions to prevent stress and harm to the animal.\nShaving\n\t\nPlace the mouse on a clean surface and grip the base of the tail of the mouse with the thumb and second finger to secure the position of the mouse. The mouse may jump or make sudden movements; if it does, quickly respond and pull back the clippers to prevent injury.\nShave the hair of the mouse with a hair clipper (Figures 1A, 1B). Position the blade parallel to the skin of the mouse and shave the whole back from the neck to the tail, including all around the tail, to allow for a large enough surface area to place a transparent film dressing (see Table of Materials). Lightly run the blade against the direction of hair growth for the most efficient cut. (Figure 1B).",
    "Do not press the blade deeply into the skin, since it may damage the skin by bruising or cutting.\nApplication of depilatory lotion\n\tNOTE: Use depilatory lotion to obtain a very smooth skin so that the transparent dressing can adhere firmly.\n\t\nSoak the skin of the mouse with water to prevent chemical burns by lightly pressing a drenched paper wipe against the shaved skin with enough pressure to wet the already cut hair down against the skin.\nWhile the skin is wet, lightly rub the skin of the mouse with a small dollop of depilatory lotion (see Table of Materials) for 15-20 s (Figures 1C, 1D). Spread the lotion completely over wherever the hair has been cut short. Use more lotion if the mouse is larger.\nDo not apply lotion on the ears of the mouse, tail, or anywhere near the face. If the lotion gets on the ears or tail, simply wipe with a wet paper wipe until rinsing. If the lotion gets on the face of the mouse, immediately wash the mouse under running tap or deionized water to prevent damage to the eyes, nose, and mouth.\nLeave the lotion to react with the hair for an additional 20-45 s after application.\nBefore rinsing, check the completion of the depilatory reaction by lightly wiping away the lotion from the skin at various locations (Figure 1E) with a gloved finger or a thin metal spatula. The reaction is complete if the skin is pink without the presence of black hair. It is best to quickly check that the hair has actually been removed before rinsing than rinsing prematurely and then having to apply lotion again.\nRinsing",
    "NOTE: Once the completion of the hair removal reaction has been verified, wash the mouse with running tap or deionized water to remove the depilatory lotion and prevent chemical burns.\n\t\nPlace the mouse on the left gloved hand and press the base of the tail against the palm with the left thumb to prevent the mouse from moving around. Close and straighten the rest of the left fingers to prevent the mouse from biting.\nPosition the mouse so the face/head region is away from the stream of water and the stream of lukewarm water can fall behind the head and only on the back. Quickly but gently rub the back of the mouse with the right gloved hand to wash away the lotion. \nOnce the skin of the mouse is free of the lotion, quickly wipe the mouse with a paper towel to absorb most of the water (Figure 1F).\nCare after shaving and hair removal\n\t\nCheck and clean any residual depilatory lotion that may remain on the ears and tail with a wet paper wipe.\nPlace the mouse back in its individual cage and place the cage on a heating pad (40-45 °C) for about 30 min. The mouse should return to normal behavior, scurry around, and groom itself within a few min.\nHouse each mouse in a separate cage throughout the duration of the experiment. The skin of the mice is no longer protected and can be easily scratched and bitten by other mice.\nSince the depilatory lotion can have slight irritating effects that may interfere with or alter the wound healing process, wait 18-24 h before surgery to allow the mouse skin to calm down and the mouse to adjust to the lack of hair on its back.\nRemoving Hair from Skin with Dark Pigmentation",
    "NOTE: Some db/db-/- mice will potentially have dark patches in the skin that will have hair growing back faster and stronger than skin without these patches. (Figure 2A). These dark areas of the skin appear darker in color due to mid-late anagen stage hair follicles and/or pigment incontinence29,30.\n\t\nIf dark patches are noticed, apply depilatory lotion again, but only in these areas, and repeat step 4.2 and 4.3 (Figures 2B, 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: The dark patches of skin will grow hair faster throughout the duration of the experiment, so clip the hair short every 3-5 days, when necessary. A patch or two away from the desired location of the wound is acceptable. If the back of the mouse is significantly covered by these dark patches, do not use this mouse for the chronic wound model.\n5. Reagent Setup\nNOTE: The development of chronic wounds in db/db-/- mice is accomplished by treatment with specific inhibitors for catalase and glutathione peroxidase, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) and mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA), respectively16. The following procedure details the dose and administration of the analgesia and inhibitors based on the weight of the mouse.\nInject the pain reliever Buprenex intraperitoneally at 0.05 mg/kg mouse in sterile PBS. Inject a volume of 120 µL for a 60 g mouse approximately 30 min before surgery. Administer another dose 6 h after surgery. An extra dose may be given as needed.\nInject ATZ intraperitoneally at 1 g/kg mouse in sterile PBS. Inject a volume of 480 µL for a 60 g mouse approximately 20 min before surgery. Inject half of the volume on the left side of the abdomen and the other half on the right side.",
    "Deposit MSA topically onto the wound between the transparent dressing and the wound tissue at 150 mg/kg mouse in sterile PBS. Administer a volume of 60 µL for a 60 g mouse within 10 min after surgery.\n6. Surgery\nNOTE: The success of the chronic wound model relies on non-sterile conditions. These mice are not germ-free and are housed in a conventional vivarium. The bacteria microbiome that resides in the skin is crucial for the subsequent initiation and development of chronic wounds upon treatment with inhibitors of anti-oxidant enzymes. Therefore, traditional pre-surgical preparation of the site is contra-indicated.\nIntraperitoneal Injection\n\t\nSecure the mouse on slanted portion of the cage rack and hold the tail with the mouse comfortably standing with the head lower than the body of the mouse. This ensures that we attempt to move the internal organs as far away from the injection point possible. \nInsert the needle in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen to avoid injection into the bladder, or other abdominal organs. \nAspirate the needle before injection. \nTreatment and Anesthesia\n\t\nAdminister Buprenex 30 min and ATZ 20 min before surgery, as described in Steps 5.1 and 5.2.\nPlace the mouse in a small plastic container on top of a warm heating pad as shown in Figure 3A for approximately 15-20 min. Providing heat support prior to the procedure protects against potential mortality.\nPlace a paper wipe or paper towel over the top of the small container to better contain the heat. The mouse should calm down as it warms. Figure 3B shows materials necessary for surgery.\nPlace the mouse in an enclosed container that is hooked up to the isoflurane vaporizer in the chemical hood if using an open system.",
    "In an open system, administer 5% isoflurane for 1-2 min at a flow rate of 2-3.5 L/min. Continuously monitor the status of the mouse.\n\t\t\nOnce the mouse is unconscious or no longer moving, place the mouse on a white surgical pad and fit the head with a nose cone that is secured to the vaporizer to allow continuous administration of isoflurane during surgery.\nIn an open system, administer 2-3% isoflurane at the same flow rate during surgery and adjust to the flow of isoflurane to maintain depth of anesthesia.\nMinimize both the concentration and duration of isoflurane administered during surgery. db/db-/- mice are very sensitive to anesthesia so it is best to keep isoflurane exposure to a minimum. If the mouse is still responsive after 2 min at 5% isoflurane, secure the nose cone and administer 3-5% isoflurane for 15-30 s before starting surgery.\n\t\t\nConfirm proper anesthetization before wounding. Depth of anesthesia is confirmed by lack of response to physical stimuli such as strong toe pinch. The length of time of the mouse under inhaled anesthesia is under 5 min so no vet ointment is applied to the eyes.\nWounding\n\t\nSpray a paper wipe with 70% ethanol or a clinical ethanol towelette and wipe the back of the mouse to clean the area of the wound site. Clean the surface of the skin so the transparent dressing can adhere firmly, since dust from the bedding, food, or skin can prevent the dressing from sticking properly (Figure 4A). Do not wipe excessively, or there will be a risk of killing the bacteria present on the skin.\nDetermine the position of the wound site. The best place to perform the wound is on the dorsal side of the mouse, centered and away from patches of skin with higher pigmentation.",
    "NOTE: We have determined by experience that these mice can only withstand the burden of one wound.\nCreate a wound within 30-45 s using a 7 mm skin biopsy punch, tweezers and surgical scissors. Lightly press the biopsy punch onto the desired wound site and twist the punch around just deep enough to leave a slight impression of the punch (Figure 4B). Excise the outlined skin by pulling up the center of the punch with tweezers and cutting along the outline with surgical scissors (Figures 4C-4E).\nCover the wound firmly with half of a piece of transparent film dressing (6 cm x 3.5 cm).\nStop administration of 2% isoflurane to the mouse (Figure 4F).\n7. Post-Surgery Treatment and Recovery\nAdminister MSA treatment after surgery is complete and the transparent dressing is applied as described in Step 5.3. Deposit MSA onto the wound area under the dressing.\nPlace the mouse back in the small container on the heating pad for 30 min to help with recovery. Once the mouse has warmed up, put the mouse back in its cage. The effect of the isoflurane is temporary, and the mouse should be moving around shortly thereafter.\nDo not leave mice unattended nor return them to the vivarium until the mice have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n\tNOTE: The anesthesia of choice when working with these mice is isoflurane precisely due to its quick induction and subsequent emergence from anesthesia.\n\t\nHouse mice that have undergone surgery individually to avoid one mouse interfering with the chronic wound of another. As stated above, they do not return to the vivarium until fully recovered.\nAdminister the second dose of Buprenex 6 h after surgery.\nObserve the mice carefully for the first 48 h after surgery.",
    "NOTE: The surgery, coupled with the inhibitors to create the chronic wound, is very stressful on the animal that is already both diabetic and obese. Mice that survive the first couple days after surgery will usually survive the duration of the experiment.\n8. Data Collection, Survival Strategies, Handling the Mice After Wounding, and Additional Tips\nData collection\n\t\nTake pictures as early as immediately after surgery. Biofilms are observed anywhere between 5-10 days after wounding, and as early as 3 days.\nIf bacteria are the focus of analysis, roll a sterile swap with light pressure around the wound for 10-15 s. Store the swab, in an appropriate freezer media for culturing or dry without any media for culture-independent sequencing analysis, at -80 °C. Collect extracellular polymeric substances via a sterile metal spatula into a microcentrifuge tube and store at -80 °C before analysis.\nDo not administer anesthesia to the mouse during handling for biofilm collection or picture taking. During these procedures, place a piece of food in front of the mouse to calm the mouse down and prevent it from running off. Most mice will climb on top of the food, sit on it, and not move.\nAs secondary infections and unintended chronic wounds or ulcers can develop if the mouse is not properly moving or if the dressing is not applied correctly, periodically check the activity of the mouse and the ventral side for sores. Friction between the skin and wet bedding (db/db-/- mice are polyuric) can disturb the skin if the cages are not changed frequently.",
    "NOTE: Fluid buildup under the dressing can cause the adhesive to lose its stickiness and allow the fluid to leak. Dead skin cell, bedding, and fecal matter can then stick onto the skin and harden. These dried patches and aggregates on the skin should be cleared promptly to prevent a secondary infection.\nIf the mice stand or sit on their hind legs, move these mice to a cage where access to food and water is much lower. If the position of food and water in the cage is high, the mouse may stand or sit on its hind legs to reach it. Most mice will not have a problem eating and drinking if they could do so before surgery, though there is a possibility that some mice might flip over onto their backs. These \"flippers\" may have great difficulty turning over so they will need assistance and further monitoring.\nLeave the transparent dressing on the skin for up to 20 days if the skin is clear of debris, flakey skin and hair. If any of these occur on the skin, remove the old dressing and apply a new piece.\n\t\nTo take off the dressing, lightly pinch the skin directly behind the head, then pull the dressing away from the head in one smooth motion.\nTo place a piece of dressing on securely, have the mouse stay as still as possible. It is important that the skin is clean and free from flaky dead skin cells, dust from the bedding, and pieces of food. Place and then press the dressing into the skin around the wound to secure.",
    "If placing a piece of food in front of the mouse does not limit its movements, then place the mouse on top of the wire cage. Once the mouse has gripped a rail on the cage, hold the tail as close to the body as possible and pull with minimal force. As the mouse pulls forward the back will stretch and straighten for easy application; place the dressing securely at this point.\nNever re-use an old dressing. Always apply new dressing to the back for the greatest adhesion.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
