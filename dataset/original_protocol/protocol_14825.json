    "Femoral heads were collected from patients undergoing elective THR surgery in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the Stanford University School of Medicine. All tissues were collected as de-identified specimens in accordance with regulations of the Stanford University Research Compliance Office.\n​1. Selecting a Breast Cancer Cell Line(s)\nObtain or transfect the desired breast cancer cell line(s) with a luciferase-GFP reporter construct. The following experiments were performed using the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines engineered for the stable expression of firefly luciferase (fLuc) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by transfection with the Sleeping Beauty transposon plasmid pKT2/LuBiG and the transposase plasmid pK/hUbiC-SB1145,46.\n\tNOTE: The transfected cell lines are referred to as MDA-MB-231-fLuc-EGFP, and MCF-7-fLuc-EGFP.\n2. Isolating Tissue Fragments from Femoral Heads\nFollowing THR surgery, collect the discarded femoral head in a sterile container filled with physiological saline. Transfer the specimen to the laboratory and process it within 1-3 hr of surgery. Note: if there is a delay in processing, place the specimen at 4 °C.\nPrepare a working area by placing the following items on an absorbent mat in a laminar flow tissue culture hood: sterile gloves, surgical rongeur, forceps, beaker with 70% isopropanol to rinse instruments, and tissue culture vessels as stipulated below for each type of experiment.\nWearing a sterile surgical glove to hold the round femur head in one hand, use the rongeur in the other hand to extract trabecular bone fragments of desired size (~2-5 mm) from the exposed upper shaft of the femur. Transfer bone fragments into the culture vessel (e.g., 6-, 12-, or 24-well tissue culture plate or migration chamber), depending on the type of proliferation, colonization or migration experiment, as described in steps 3, 4 or 5.",
    "NOTE: Bone tissue fragments should be harvested as described above after completing the initial steps for each specific proliferation, colonization or migration assay. Fragments will range in size as shown in Figure 2. Fragments can be weighed before or after experiments for the purpose of standardization.\n3. Co-culturing Breast Cancer Cells Adjacent to Bone Fragments to Measure Breast Cell Proliferation Using BLI\nPrior to the experiment, prepare a suspension containing 2 x 105 breast cancer cells/50 µl, and prepare plugs of bone wax for immobilizing bone fragments in culture. Cut a P200 micropipette tip into 3 pieces and use the narrow end of the largest piece in a “cookie cutter” manner to cut small (~35 mg) pieces of bone wax. Use the wide end of the smallest piece to eject the bone wax plugs into a Petri dish for storage.\nPlace a piece of bone wax at the 12 o’clock position of each well and gently press down with a sterile-gloved index finger.\nPipette 50 µl of cell suspension containing 1 x 105 breast cancer cells in DMEM-10% FBS + Pen-Strep in the center of each well of a 6-well plate. (Alternatively, seed cells in a dispersed pattern if desired.) Place the plate in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator for 45 min to promote cell attachment.\nPlace 1 bone fragment onto 1 piece of bone wax for each experimental well and apply gentle pressure with the rongeur to secure it. Perform experiments in triplicate such that 3 bone fragments from a given THR specimen are placed into the top three wells, while the bottom three wells contain bone wax only as controls.",
    "Using a 5 ml pipette, gently and slowly deliver 5 ml of DMEM-10% FBS to the side of each well to avoid dislodging the breast cells or bone fragments. Place the plate in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator for 20-24 hr.\nTo perform bioluminescence imaging (BLI) remove the plate from the incubator and add luciferin substrate (to achieve a concentration of 300 µg/ml) to each well. Image the plate immediately on an IVIS Imaging Platform using the following parameters: f-stop of 1, small binning, exposure time of 1 sec, level D. Measure the signal intensity of each well as average radiance (photons/second/square centimeter/steradian).\nUse imaging software to define Regions of Interest (ROI) to quantitate the average radiance for all experimental and control wells. Export average radiance values to an Excel sheet to perform statistics and generate graphs.\n4. Co-culturing Breast Cancer Cells Seeded Directly Onto Bone Fragments to Study Colonization and Cell Number\nUse forceps to place bone fragments directly into the empty wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate (1 fragment/well).\nPipette a 50 µl cell suspension droplet of DMEM-10% FBS containing 1 X 103-6 breast cancer cells directly on top of each bone fragment. Place the plate in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator for 45 min to promote cell attachment. Gently add 1-2 ml DMEM-10% FBS into the side of each well such that the fragment is entirely submerged in medium. Incubate the plate in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator for 20-24 hr.",
    "After incubation, use forceps to transfer each bone tissue fragment to a fresh 24-well plate containing 1 ml DMEM-10% FBS in each well. To perform BLI, follow steps 3.6-3.7 above. Additionally, fragments may be viewed using a fluorescence microscope, or flushed to obtain the marrow population for analyses of breast cancer cell numbers and properties as described in step 6.\nTo prepare the intact fragments for qualitative evaluation by fluorescence microscopy following BLI, pipette 5 µl of fluorescent bisphosphonate labeling solution (prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions) into each well to label the mineralized spicules of the bone fragments. Incubate the plate in the tissue culture incubator for another 24 hr.\nFollowing 24 hr of culture in fluorescent bisphosphonate labeling solution, use forceps to transfer the fragments to tissue culture plates containing phenol red-free medium and view using a fluorescence microscope configured to image GFP (485 nm) and bisphosphonate label (680 nm).\n5. Measuring Migration of Breast Cancer Cells to Bone Tissue Fragments and Cultured Bone Fragment Supernatants\nMigration toward bone tissue culture supernatant.\n\tNOTE: Perform experiments in triplicate such that 3 fragments from a given THR specimen are used to generate 3 supernatants. For each experiment, migration is compared across three wells containing bone supernatants vs. three wells containing control medium only.\n\t\nGenerate bone tissue supernatants by placing bone fragments into the wells of a 12-well plate containing 2.2 ml DMEM-10% FBS per well. Culture in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator for 24 hr. Withdraw the medium at 24 hr and replace with 2.2 ml fresh DMEM-10% FBS. Treat control wells containing DMEM-10% FBS the same way.",
    "NOTE: The medium is changed at 24 hr to remove factors secreted in response to tissue trauma resulting from surgery. Because bone tissue supernatants are generated in FBS-containing medium, wells containing FBS-containing medium only are included to control for the contributions of FBS to breast cancer cell migration.\nAt 48 hr, collect 0.9 ml of each supernatant/control medium and pipette into the wells of a receiver plate. The inserts will later be placed into these wells. Incubate the receiver plate in the tissue culture incubator while seeding the inserts. Note: The remaining supernatant (~1 ml after evaporation) can be collected for analysis of secretome factors if desired44.\nTo seed the Transwell inserts, place them into a standard, empty 24-well tissue culture plate. Pipette 350 µl cell suspension containing 1 x 105 breast cancer cells in DMEM-10% FBS onto the upper, inner membrane surface of each insert as shown in Figure 1A. Place the 24-well plate containing the seeded inserts into the 37 °C tissue culture incubator for 45 min to promote attachment.\nOnce the cells have attached to the inserts, use forceps to transfer the inserts to the receiver plate according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Angle each insert when placing it into the receiver well to prevent bubble formation between the insert membrane and the receiver well supernatant. Incubate the receiver plate with inserts for 20 hr in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Check the bottom side of the receiver plate for bubbles between the insert membrane and the receiver well supernatant. If bubbles are visible, remove the specific inserts and place them again into the receiver well until no bubbles are present.",
    "After 20 hr use forceps to remove the inserts from the receiver plate. Using the procedures in steps 3.6-3.7 perform BLI to image the cells that have migrated into and attached to the bottom of the receiver plate wells.\nMigration toward bone tissue fragments.\n\tNOTE: Perform experiments in triplicate such that 3 fragments from a given THR specimen are placed into 3 separate inserts, and 3 glass beads are placed into 3 separate inserts as controls.\n\t\nPrepare the receiver plate by pipetting 0.9 ml DMEM-10% FBS into each well. Place it into the tissue culture incubator while preparing the inserts.\nTo seed the inserts, invert them on the surface of a plastic microfuge tube box that has a lid. Pipette a 50 µl cell suspension droplet of DMEM-10% FBS containing 1 x 105 breast cancer cells directly onto the outer, bottom surface of each insert membrane (which is facing up on the inverted inserts). Cover the microfuge tube box with the lid cracked open and transfer it to the 37 °C tissue incubator for 45 min to promote cell attachment.\nTransfer the microfuge tube box to the tissue culture hood, and use forceps to turn the seeded inserts right side up and transfer them into the wells of the receiver plate. Pipette 0.450 ml DMEM-10% FBS into each insert cup. Using forceps, transfer one bone tissue fragment (~3 mm) into each prepared insert cup. Optionally, use glass beads as negative controls in additional wells. Place the plate in a tissue culture incubator for 20 hr.",
    "To measure migration, prepare a standard 24-well tissue culture plate containing 1 ml DMEM-10% FBS per well. Remove the receiver plate from the incubator and use forceps to transfer the bone fragments and beads from each insert into separate wells of the standard plate. Add luciferin substrate (to achieve a final concentration of 300 µg/ml) to each well and perform BLI using the procedures in steps 3.6-3.7.\n6. Additional Pre- and Post-experimental Analyses\nAnalysis of flushed marrow.\n\t\nTransfer a bone fragment into a 70 µm cell strainer placed at the top of a 50 ml conical tube. Use a 10 ml syringe with a 25 G needle to vigorously flush the fragment with 10 ml of PBS to obtain a suspension of marrow cells in the conical tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 3 min at 300 x g and 21 °C, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pelleted cells in PBS or other desired solution for flow cytometry.\n\t\tNOTE: Resuspension volumes will vary depending on the size of the cell pellet after centrifugation, and application.\nFor viability assays ~75-300 µl volumes of PBS are appropriate, and these suspensions can be analyzed using commercially available fluorescence based viability assays according to the manufacturer’s instructions, pipetted into a conventional hemocytometer, and counted using an inverted fluorescence microscope.\nFor flow cytometric analysis or sorting based on detection of GFP-positive breast cancer cells, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml PBS containing 2% FBS, 2mM EDTA, and 10 mM HEPES such that the concentration is 1 x 106 cells/ml.\nH & E Staining and Immunohistochemistry.\n\t\nTo process the fragments for hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining and/or immunohistochemistry, place the fragments in plastic cassettes labeled with a number 2 pencil, and submerge in a container filled with 10% buffered formalin for 24 hr.",
