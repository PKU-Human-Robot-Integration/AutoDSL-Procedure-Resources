  "procedures": [
    "All animal experiments and procedures were approved by the East Carolina University (ECU) Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and conducted in compliance with guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and ECU on laboratory animal care and use. Inducible, intestinal-specific claudin-7 knockout mice were generated by crossing C57BL6 claudin-7-flox transgenic mice with Villin-CreERT2 mice19. Male and female mice aged 3 months were used in this study.\n1. Reagent/equipment preparation\nCool the following reagents/equipment before starting their associated experiments: phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for washing colon tissue during crypt isolation; a rocker/rotator (place in a 4 °C refrigerator) for incubation with epithelial dissociation media.\n\t\nRemove the gel matrix (see Table of Materials) from -20 °C and thaw on ice before plating.\nPre-cool the centrifuge to 4 °C prior to spinning down crypts for plating.\nCool 0.1% sodium citrate buffer (see Table of Materials) and keep on ice prior to in situ cell death detection.\nWarm the following reagents before starting their associated experiments: a 96-well culture plate for 24 h before plating; L-WRN media (see Table of Materials) before adding to plated crypts and before each media change.\n\t\nHeat the water bath to 94 °C before staining.\n2. Murine colonic crypt isolation\nPrepare the necessary media following the steps below.\n\tNOTE: The media volumes are calculated here for the colonic tissue of two mice.\n\t\nPrepare epithelial dissociation media: 30 mL of 1x PBS + 400 µL of 0.5 M EDTA + 50 µL of 10 mM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (see Table of Materials). Keep on ice until use.\nPrepare crypt dissociation media: 10 mL of 1x PBS + 10 µL of 10 mM Y-27632 dihydrochloride. Keep on ice until use.",
    "Supplement L-WRN media: 50 mL of L-WRN media + 47.5 mL of DMEM high glucose with L-Glutamine + 500 µL of L-glutamine + 500 µL of pennicilin/streptomycin + 1,000 µL of B-27 supplement (50x) + 500 µL of N2 supplement (100x) + 50 µL of HEPES (1 M) buffer solution (see Table of Materials).\nFilter the complete (supplemented) L-WRN media and aliquot for storage at -20 °C for up to 3 months.\n\t\tNOTE: Thawed media is stable at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nPerform the crypt isolation.\n\t\nFor general anesthesia, add 1 mL of isoflurane to cotton and place it inside a plastic cassette within a 0.09 cubic feet anesthesia chamber (see Table of Materials). Place the mouse in the anesthesia chamber until breathing halts (approximately 3-5 min) and then perform cervical dislocation20.\nMake an approximately 2 in incision down the midline of the mouse, pinning the back skin to expose the abdomen. Isolate the colon by cutting just below the cecum from the proximal side and above the rectum from the distal side21.\nUsing forceps, remove the adipose tissue attached to the colon. Gently push feces out utilizing the flat end of the forceps and cut the tissue open longitudinally.\nWash the tissue 10-15 times with cold 1x PBS using forceps to \"swirl\" the tissue around in PBS between washes.\nUsing clean, sharp scissors, cut the tissue into small pieces, approximately 3-5 mm in size.\nRepeat the process for the second mouse and combine the tissue pieces in a 50 mL tube containing cold epithelial dissociation media (step 2.1.1).\nIncubate the colon tissue pieces in epithelial dissociation media for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking.",
    "Allow the tissue fragments to sink to the bottom of the tube, then carefully discard the epithelial dissociation media without disrupting the tissue. Repeat this process when washing the tissue 10-15 times with cold 1x PBS. Discard as much PBS as possible during the final wash.\nAdd crypt dissociation media (step 2.1.2) to the 50 mL tube containing colon tissue pieces and continuously shake for 5-10 min by hand.\n\t\tNOTE: The media must become cloudy from the dissociated crypts.\nUnder the cell culture hood, filter the tissue and media with a 70 µm nylon cell strainer (see Table of Materials) into a fresh 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 10 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant without disturbing the crypt-containing pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the equipment, one may transfer the strained media to a 15 mL tube for centrifuging.\nResuspend the pellet in ~3-4 mL of cold 1x PBS.\nPipette 10 µL of the isolated crypts in a line on a microscope slide. Under the microscope, count the number of full, long crypts to estimate crypt concentration per 10 µL.\nCalculate the appropriate volume of crypts to spin down in order to plate 10 crypts/µL in a 96-well plate.\n3. Crypt plating\nCentrifuge an appropriate volume of isolated crypts in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant using a 1,000 µL pipette without disrupting the pelleted crypts.\nAdd 100 µL of gel matrix (enough for nine wells) to the pelleted crypts and pipette carefully to avoid introducing air bubbles.\n\tNOTE: See the Discussion section for a detailed description of how to mix the gel matrix and crypts. Typically, 100 µL is sufficient for nine wells.",
    "Allow the gel matrix to partially solidify (~1-2 min).\nPlate 10 µL of the gel matrix mixed with the crypts in each well of a pre-warmed 96-well culture plate to form a dome shape.\n\tNOTE: Place the dome in the center of the well. Be careful not to allow the gel matrix to spread to the sides of the well. See the Discussion section for a detailed description on solidification and plating.\nAllow the gel matrix to be fully set for 10-20 min in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nPrepare the final working solution of L-WRN media.\n\t\nAdd 100 µL pennicilin/streptomycin to a 10 mL aliquot of L-WRN media (see step 2.1.3) (stable for 2 weeks at 4 °C).\nAdd supplements to 900 µL of L-WRN media with pennicilin/streptomycin: 0.9 µL of 1 mg/mL EGF + 0.9 µL of 10 mM Y-27632 dihydrochloride.\n\t\tNOTE: The volumes are based upon nine wells. Y-27632 dihydrochloride is only added on day 0 (at the time of plating).\nAdd 100 µL of media to each well. Be careful not to disrupt the dome.\nIncubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n4. Creating claudin-7 knockout in culture\nAllow the crypts to grow normally in culture for 24 h after plating.\nIn a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, add 2.7 µL of 1 mmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OH-Tamoxifen) to 900 µL of L-WRN media (final concentration of 3 µmol/L) + 0.9 µL of 1 mg/mL EGF.\n\tNOTE: The stock solution of 4OH-Tamoxifen is prepared by mixing powdered 4OH-Tamoxifen (see Table of Materials) with 1x PBS to a concentration of 1 mmol/L.\nRemove old media from the wells via vacuum suction.\nAdd 100 µL of 4OH-Tamoxifen-containing media to each well and label them as claudin-7 cKO/4OH-TAM.",
    "NOTE: DMSO needs to be added to the control wells. Fresh 4OH-Tamoxifen-containing media must be added every 2 days.\nIncubate at 37 °C until the next media change (~2-3 days).\n5. Colonic organoid maintenance\nNOTE: Media must be changed every 2-3 days. Culture up to 12 days.\nPrepare a fresh final working solution of L-WRN media: 900 µL of L-WRN media + 0.9 µL of 1 mg/mL EGF.\nRemove old media from the wells via vacuum suction. Add fresh media to the wells.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to disrupt the dome.\nIncubate at 37 °C until the next media change.\n\t​NOTE: Cultures can be maintained and passaged for the duration desired for the experiment. The cultures for the present study were typically maintained for between 9-12 days, but one may wish to continue further, for 15 or 20 days.\n6. Harvesting and embedding colonic organoids\nRemove old media from the wells via vacuum suction.\nFix the organoids with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: PFA is a toxic material. Take precautions when using this reagent.\nRemove 4% PFA from the wells via vacuum suction and add 30% sucrose for 24 h at 4 °C.\nLabel a plastic mold and fill it to 90% with optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound (see Table of Materials).\nRemove 30% sucrose from the wells via vacuum suction. Add 10 µL of 1x PBS to each well.\nWith a pipette tip, gently scratch the bottom of the well to dissociate the dome containing organoids.\nWith a pipette, remove the PBS containing the dissociated organoids and load the liquid into the mold containing OCT.\n\tNOTE: Avoid introducing bubbles into the OCT compound.\nContinue this process until all organoids have been removed from all wells.",
    "In a stainless-steel Dewar flask, add dry ice pellets and 2-methylbutane (enough to cover the dry ice pellets) (see Table of Materials).\nSteadily hold the organoid-containing OCT block above 2-methylbutane to flash freeze.\nStore the organoid-containing OCT block at -80 °C until ready to section (can be stored for up to 1 year).\n7. Immunofluorescence\nSection the organoid-containing OCT block at a 5 µm thickness using a cryostat (see Table of Materials) at -20 °C.\nFor each section, check under the microscope to ensure an organoid was captured. When sectioning is complete, store the slides at -80 °C until ready to stain (can be stored for up to 6 months).\nHeat the slides in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer for 10 min at 94 °C.\n\tNOTE: The buffer is made by dissolving sodium citrate in deionized water. Adjust the pH to 6 with hydrochloric acid.\nAllow the slides to cool on the benchtop for 20 min. Rinse with distilled water for 5 min.\nAssemble the slides in a staining rack (see Table of Materials) with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubate with 100 mM glycine for 15 min.\nRinse three times with 1x PBS for 5 min each. Block with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 45 min at room temperature.\nIncubate with claudin-7 anti-murine rabbit primary antibody22 (diluted in 1% BSA) overnight at 4 °C. Rinse three times with 1x PBS for 10 min each.\nIncubate with Cy3 anti-rabbit secondary antibody23 (diluted in 1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Rinse three times with 1x PBS for 10 min each.\nMount the slides with an appropriate mounting medium (see Table of Materials) with DAPI and add a coverslip.\n8. Cell death detection",
    "Fix the organoids inside the wells with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Rinse with 1x PBS for 5 min.\nIncubate the culture plate on ice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in cold 0.1% sodium citrate buffer for 2 min. Rinse twice with 1x PBS for 5 min each.\nPrepare TUNEL reaction24,25 using TMR Red, an in situcell death detection kit (see Table of Materials). Add 50 µL of TUNEL reaction reagents to each well.\nIncubate in a humidified atmosphere for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark.\n\tNOTE: All the remaining steps must be completed in the dark.\nRinse three times with 1x PBS for 5 min each. Incubate with 1:2,500 Hoechst (diluted in 1x PBS, see Table of Materials) for 3 min.\nRinse three times with 1x PBS for 5 min each.
