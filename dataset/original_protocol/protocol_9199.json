    "1. Apparatus setting\nThe automatic modified T-maze apparatus (O’HARA & Co., Tokyo, Japan) is constructed of white plastic runways with 25-cm high walls1. The maze is partitioned off into 6 areas (A1, A2, S1, S2, P1, P2) by sliding doors (s1, s2, s3, a1, a2, p1, p2) (Figure 1) that can be automatically opened downward. The stem of the T is composed of area S2 (13 x 24 cm) and the arms of the T comprise areas A1 and A2 (11.5 x 20.5 cm). Areas P1 and P2 comprise the connecting passages from the arm (area A1 or A2) to the start compartment (area S1).\nThe end of each arm is equipped with a pellet dispenser that automatically provides a sucrose pellet (20 mg, Formula 5 TUT, TestDiet, Richmond, IN, USA) as a reward. The pellet intake by the mouse is detected by the infrared sensor and is automatically recorded by a computer.\nThe Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera is mounted above the apparatus to monitor the mouse’s behavior, and images of the apparatus and mouse are captured by the computer.\nPlace the T-maze apparatus in a soundproof room (170 x 210 x 200 cm, O’HARA & Co., Tokyo, Japan) as possible. The apparatus is illuminated by fluorescent lights at 100 lux in our laboratory. The light intensity could be weaker than this lux level but should be held at a constant level during all the experiments.\n2. Animal preparation\nHouse about two to four mice per cage in a temperature-controlled room (23±2°C) with a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM), according to guidance and protocols established by local Animal Care and Use Committee.\nTransfer all the cages containing mice into the soundproof room from the housing room at least 30 min before the first trial begins.",
    "All the experiments should be always performed during the same time period (e.g., 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM). During the testing period, the subjects from each genotype or experimental condition should be tested in counterbalanced order, since there could be a potential effect of the time in a day on the performance of the task.\n3. Food restriction\nUntil the beginning of the experiment, give free access to standard pellet chow and water to mice. \nFrom 1 week before the pre-training sessions, weigh mice daily and feed them with standard pellet chow to maintain 80% to 85% of their free-feeding body weight throughout the experiment.\nProvide daily with eight sucrose pellets per mouse in addition to standard pellet chow in their home cage to habituate to the sucrose pellets until beginning the pre-training sessions.\n4. Habituation to the apparatus and pre-training\nPlace six sucrose pellets per mouse into the center of each one of the six compartments of the apparatus, and deposit one pellet into each tray of the food dispensers.\nPlace all mice in a cage into the apparatus and allow them to freely explore the apparatus with all doors open for 30 min. \nFrom 1 day after the habituation, mice are daily subjected to pre-training. With all the doors closed and the pellet deposited in the food tray, place mouse into area A1. If the mouse consumes the pellet or 5 min elapse, transfer the mouse to area A2 and begin pre-training again. Such training is repeated five times a day, and continued until the mice consume more than 80% of the pellets. \nAfter the pre-training sessions are complete, the mice are subjected to either a forced alternation task or left-right discrimination task.\n5. Forced alternation task",
    "In the forced alternation task, each trial consists of a forced choice run followed by a free choice run. \nRun the application program (Image TM) for the onset of the task, and place a mouse in the start box (area S1).\nClick the start button, and a forced-choice run starts. In this run, the doors of start box (door s2) and of either area A1 (door a1) or area A2 (door a2) are opened, and a sucrose pellet is automatically delivered to the food tray of the area with the door open. The mouse is allowed to enter the area and to consume the pellet. When the mouse has eaten the pellet, the door near the food tray of the arm that the mouse currently stays (either door p1 or p2) is opened. Then, the mouse approaches the door (either s1 or s3) neighboring the start box, and either the door p1 or p2 is closed and the door s1 (or s3) is opened so that the mouse can return to the start box. If the mouse fails to eat the pellet within 30 sec, the response is recorded as an \"Omission Error\". Then, the pellet is automatically removed from the food tray and the door of the arm that the mice stayed (either p1 or p2) is opened, and then the mouse can return to the start box.",
    "Following the forced-choice run, the free-choice run automatically begins. The door s2 and both doors a1 and a2 are opened. The mouse is allowed to choose between the two arms. If the mouse enters the opposite arm that it was forced to choose in the forced-choice run, its response is considered to be \"Correct\" and the mouse receives a sucrose pellet. If the mouse fails to eat the pellet within 30 sec, the response is recorded as an “Omission Error”, and the pellet is automatically removed from the food tray. If the mouse goes to the same arm as that visited in the forced-choice task, the mouse is confined within the area for 10 sec as a penalty (“Error” response). Then, the doors of p1 (or s1) and p2 (or s3) are opened, and the mouse can return to the start box.\nA mouse is subjected to 10 consecutive trials in a session per day (cutoff time, 50 min). Control mice are trained daily to reach a group average of 80% correct response in a session. The group average of correct response is calculated by averaging the % correct responses of each mouse in a session in each group.\nAfter control and/or experimental mice are trained to the criterion, you can further test the mice in the delayed alternation task by inserting 3-, 10-, 30-, or 60-s delays between the forced-choice and the free-choice runs.\nAfter each session, return the mice to their home cage, and clean the apparatus with super hypochlorous water (pH 6-7) to prevent a bias based on olfactory cues.\n6. Left-right discrimination task",
    "In the left-right discrimination task, each mouse is given a free choice run of 10 or 20 trials. A sucrose pellet is always delivered to the food tray of one of the arms, namely, the goal arm. Mice have to learn to enter the goal arm. The location of the goal arm is invariable across trials and sessions, and is counterbalanced across control and experimental mice.\nRun the application program (Image TM) for the onset of the task, and place a mouse into the start box (area S1). \nClick the start button, and a free-choice run starts. In this run, the door s2 and both doors a1 and a2 are opened, and a pellet dispenser automatically delivers a pellet to the food tray of the goal arm. The mouse is allowed to freely choose between the left and right arms. When the mouse enters the goal arm, it is considered a correct response. If the mouse eats the pellet or 30 sec elapse, door p1 (or p2) is opened. When the mouse approaches the start box by passing through the area P1 (or P2), door s1 (or s3) is opened so that the mouse can return to the start box.\nA mouse is usually subjected to 10 to 20 consecutive trials in a session per day (cutoff time, 50 min). Control mice are trained daily to reach a group average of 80% correct response in a session. The group average of correct response is calculated by averaging the % correct responses of each mouse in a session in each group.",
    "After mice reach the criterion, you can give additional sessions to the mice either to assess retention memory and relearning by inserting a delay of several weeks between the sessions or to assess behavioral flexibility by placing the reward in the opposite, previously unbaited arm (i.e. reversal learning), as necessary. \nAfter each session, return the mice to their home cage, and clean the apparatus with super hypochlorous water (pH 6-7) to prevent a bias based on olfactory cues.\n7. Image analysis\nBehaviors in the T-maze apparatus are recorded by a video camera attached to a computer and the image is stored in a TIFF format. The application used for acquiring and analyzing the behavioral data (Image TM) is based on the public domain Image J program (developed by Wayne Rasband at the National Institute of Mental Health and available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), which was modified by Tsuyoshi Miyakawa (available through O'HARA & Co., Tokyo, Japan). \nThe Image TM program automatically generates the text files for percentage of correct response, latency (sec) to complete a session, distance traveled during the session, and the number of omission errors in the session. Also, the trace images of a mouse, raw position data, and raw response data (correct, omission, or error) in each run are produced and saved.\n8. Statistical analysis\nAnalyze each behavioral data by two-way (EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION (e.g., GENOTYPE) x SESSION or EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION x DELAY) repeated measures analysis of variance. \n9. Representative Results",
    "An example of T-maze performance by α-CaMKII+/- male mice and their wild-type control littermates (C57BL/6J background) (11-18 weeks old, n=10 per group for forced alternation or left-right discrimination task) is shown in Figures 2-4. Because α-CaMKII+/- mice exhibit high levels of aggression toward cage mates2,3, both the mutants and control mice were singly housed in a plastic cage (22.7 x 32.3 x 12.7 cm) after weaning. The experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Fujita Health University.\nIn forced alternation task, control mice will increasingly learn to make correct choices, and can usually reach the criterion of a mean 80% correct response in about 1 to 2 weeks (Figure 2A). Compared to the control mice, α-CaMKII+/- mice showed a significantly lower percentage of correct responses (GENOTYPE: F(1,18)=29.04, p<0.0001) and shorter latency (GENOTYPE: F(1,18)=8.88, p=0.008; GENOTYPE x SESSION: F(9,162)=2.24, p=0.0218) and traveled a shorter distance (GENOTYPE: F(1,18)=8.67, p=0.0086; GENOTYPE x SESSION: F(9,162)=3.19, p=0.0014) than control mice (Figure 2A, B, and C). No significant effect of genotype was found in omission errors (Figure 2D). Also, in the delayed alternation task, the correct choice percentages of α-CaMKII+/- mice were significantly lower than those of wild-type mice at any delay time (GENOTYPE: F(1,18)=38.781, p<0.0001; DELAY: F(3,54)=8.074, p=0.0002; GENOTYPE x DELAY: F(3,54)=0.223, p=0.88; Figure 3). These results indicate that the mutants displayed impaired performance compared to control mice although the mutant mice could perform the task faster than controls, suggesting that α-CaMKII deficiency induces a working memory deficit.",
    "In the left-right discrimination task, the correct choice percentages of the α-CaMKII+/- mutants gradually increased across sessions, similar to control mice (Figure 4A). Also, when a 1-month delay was inserted between sessions, there were no significant differences in the percent correct between the mutant and control mice. As in the forced alternation task, α-CaMKII+/- mutants showed a significantly shorter latency to complete a session (GENOTYPE: F(1,18)=12.12, p=0.0027) and shorter distance traveled in the apparatus during a session (GENOTYPE: F(1,18)=25.08, p<0.0001; GENOTYPE x SESSION: F(15,270)=2.83, p=0.0004) than control mice across the training sessions (Figure 4B and C). These data indicate that α-CaMKII deficiency dose not affect reference memory as assessed by this task. In the reversal-learning sessions, however, α-CaMKII+/- mutants showed a significantly lower percentage of correct responses (GENOTYPE: F(1,18)=10.92, p=0.0039; GENOTYPE x SESSION: F(5,90)=5.54, p=0.0002; Figure 4A) and had more omission errors (GENOTYPE: F(1,18)=17.12, p=0.0006; Figure 4D) than control mice. These findings suggest that α-CaMKII+/- mutant mice have reduced behavioral flexibility.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3300/3300fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
