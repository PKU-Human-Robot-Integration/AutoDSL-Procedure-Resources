    "1. Obtaining CRISPR/Cas9-targeted Single-cell Clones\nSeed HEPG2 cells on a 6-well plate at 500,000 cells per well in 2 mL of antibiotic-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Incubate for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nTransfect cells with plasmid co-expressing Cas9 and specific sgRNA against the gene of interest using an appropriate transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: For example, sgRNA can be cloned into the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP vector, as described previously4.\nReplace the culture medium 4 - 16 h after transfection with 2 mL of fresh antibiotic-free medium.\nAbout 48 h after transfection, collect single-cell suspension by trypsinizing the cells.\n\t\nTrypsinize the cells in 0.2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Add 1 mL of medium and resuspend thoroughly.\nSort the cells for GFP-positive clones, as described previously12, and collect about 3,500 cells.\nPlate the GFP-positive sorted cells on 10-cm dishes at 500, 1,000 and 2,000 cells per dish in 8 mL of penicillin/streptomycin-supplemented culture medium. Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nMaintain the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2, replacing the medium every five days, until they grow into single-cell colonies large enough to be visible to the naked eye. For most cancer cell lines, this takes about two weeks from day of plating.\nWhen the colonies are of the appropriate size (i.e., visible to the naked eye), transfer individual colonies to wells of a 96-well culture plate containing 200 µL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.\n\t\nAspirate the single-cell colonies using a 200-µL pipette with a small volume of medium. Resuspend the cells thoroughly in individual wells by triturating several times.",
    "Maintain the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2, replacing the medium every five days, until they reach 50 - 90% confluence. For most cancer cell lines, this takes about 24 - 48 h.\n2. Extracting Crude Genomic DNA Using a Direct Lysis Method\nWhen the cells reach 50 - 90% confluence, remove as much of the culture medium from the wells as possible using multi-channel vacuum suction or a multi-channel pipette.\nAdd 25 µL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (without phenol red) into each well and incubate at 37 °C for 7 min.\nResuspend the trypsinized cells thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times. Check the cells under a microscope to make sure that they are detached from the plastic surface.\nCreate a replicate of the individual clones by transferring approximately 5 µL of the single-cell suspension to an empty 96-well culture plate. Add 200 µL of culture medium to each well and maintain the cells until positive clones are identified using fluorescent PCR-capillary gel electrophoresis (see below). Serially expand the cells to 10-cm dishes or any other scale of choice (see section 7).\nAdd 5 µL of the single-cell suspension from step 2.3 to 10 µL of homemade direct-lyse buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.15% SDS, and 0.3% Tween-20)12 in a 96-well PCR plate and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times. Centrifuge briefly (to bring the liquid down to the bottom of the wells).\nAdd 200 µL of culture medium to the remaining ~ 15 µL of cell suspension from step 2.3 and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2, together with the replicate from step 2.4.",
    "Subject the lysates from step 2.5 to the following thermal cycling program to ensure complete lysis of the cells and release of genomic DNA: 65 °C for 30 s, 8 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1.5 min, 97 °C for 3 min, 8 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 3 min, 97 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 80 °C for 10 min. Centrifuge the lysates briefly.\nDilute the lysates by adding 40 µL of nuclease-free water and mix thoroughly using a vortex mixer. Centrifuge briefly. The diluted lysates can be used immediately or stored at -20 °C for several months without significant loss of quality.\n3. Performing Fluorescent PCR to Amplify CRISPR/Cas9 Target Regions\nDesign two fluorophore-labeled forward primers (both labeled at the 5' end) for each CRISPR/Cas9 target region; cutting sites that are further than 300 bp from each other should be considered as two separate target regions (e.g., green fluorophore-labeled primer for untargeted wildtype control and blue fluorophore-labeled primer for CRISPR/Cas9-targeted clones; see the Table of Materials).\n\t\nProcure these labeled forward primers and an unlabeled reverse primer accordingly. Note that primers can be designed using any tool of choice and that the amplicons should be 200 - 500 bp long.\nPerform PCR as described previously12 to amplify target regions using the labeled primers.",
    "Use 3 µL of the diluted lysates from step 2.8 in a 20-µL reaction (see Table 1) and the following thermal cycling program: 94 °C for 10 min (1 cycle); 94 °C for 10 s, 64 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min (4 cycles); 94 °C for 10 s, 61 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min (4 cycles); 94 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min (4 cycles); 94 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min (35 cycles).\nResolve 5 µL of the PCR amplicons on a 1% agarose gel to check for size and relative amount of amplicons12.\n\tNOTE: Performing this step for all the samples is encouraged but not necessary; resolving a selected number of samples is sufficient to estimate the amount of amplicons present in the samples in general.\n4. Preparing Samples for Capillary Gel Electrophoresis\nDilute amplicons of wildtype (untargeted parental cells) and CRISPR/Cas9-targeted DNA in nuclease-free water to approximately 2.5 ng/µL. Make sure to dilute enough wildtype DNA sample to be added to each targeted DNA sample (a minimum of 0.5 µL of diluted wildtype sample per targeted sample is required).\nMix the diluted wildtype and targeted DNA samples in equal ratio (e.g., mix 1 µL of wildtype sample with 1 µL of targeted sample).\nAdd 1 µL of the mixed amplicons to 8.7 µL of deionized formamide and 0.3 µL of dye-labeled size standard in a 96-well PCR plate that is compatible with the genetic analyzer.",
    "NOTE: The use of a master mix of the formamide and the size standard (i.e., a preparation of a premix of the formamide and the size standard in a 29:1 ratio prior to the addition of amplicons to ensure standardized amounts) is recommended.\nTightly seal the plate and heat the samples at 95 °C for 3 min using a PCR thermocycler.\nPlace the plate on ice immediately after the heating step and incubate for at least 3 min.\n5. Performing Capillary Gel Electrophoresis on a Genetic Analyzer\nSet up assay parameters, instrument protocol, and size-calling protocol on the capillary gel electrophoresis software connected to a genetic analyzer.\n\tNOTE: This step is only required for the first electrophoresis run; the program can be saved for future use. For subsequent runs, go straight to step 5.2.\n\t\nClick on the \"Create New Plate\" icon on the software dashboard.\nGive the run a dummy name and select the following options: Number of wells, 96; Plate Type, Fragment; Capillary Length, 50 cm; and Polymer, POP7. Click on the \"Assign Plate Content\" button.\nUnder \"Assays,\" click \"Create New Assay\"; a new panel will appear.\nName the assay \"FPCR-CGE Assay\" and check that \"Application Type\" is correctly set as \"Fragment.\"\nSet up instrument protocol by clicking on the \"Create New\" button under \"Instrument Protocol.\"\n\t\t\nSet or choose the following options and parameters in the appropriate areas: Application Type, Fragment; Capillary Length, 50 cm; Polymer, POP7; Dye Set, G5; Run Module, FragmentAnalysis; Protocol Name, FPCR-CGE Instrument Protocol; Oven Temperature, 60 °C; Run Voltage, 19.5 kV; Pre-run Voltage, 15 kV; Injection Voltage, 1.6 kV; Run Time, 1,330 s; Pre-run Time, 180 s; Injection Time, 15 s; and Data Delay, 1 s.",
    "Click on the \"Apply to Assay\" button and then the \"Save to Library\" button to save the program. Close the panel to continue.\nSet up a size-calling protocol by clicking on the \"Create New\" button under \"Sizecalling Protocol.\"\n\t\t\nSet or choose the following options and parameters in the appropriate areas: Protocol Name, FPCR-CGE Sizecalling Protocol; Size standard, GS500(-250)LIZ; Size-caller, SizeCaller v1.1.0; Analysis Settings,-; Analysis Range, Full; Sizing Range, Full; Size Calling Method, Local Southern; Primer Peak, Present; Blue, Green, Orange Channels, (Check); Minimum Peak Height, 175 for all channels; Use Smoothing, None; Use Baselining (Baseline Window (Pts)), (Check) 51; Minimum Peak Half Width, 2; Peak Window Size, 15; Polynomial Degree, 3; Slope Threshold Peak Start, 0.0; Slope Threshold Peak End, 0.0; QC Settings, -; Size Quality, -; Fail if Value is <0.25; Pass if Value is <0.75; Assume Linearity from 0 bp to 800 bp; and Actuate Pull-Up flag if Pull-Up Ratio ≤ 0.1 and Pull-Up Scan ≤ 1.\nClick on the \"Apply to Assay\" button and then the \"Save to Library\" button to save the program. Close the panel to continue.\nEnsure that the assay is saved by clicking on the \"Save to Library\" button once more and exit the panel by clicking the \"Close\" button.\nBack at the \"Assign Plate Contents\" page, click on the \"Create New File Name Convention\" link under \"File Name Conventions.\"\nName the program \"FPCR-CGE File Name.\"\nUnder \"Available Attributes,\" select the desired attributes that will appear in the file name (such as \"Date of Run,\" \"Time of Run,\" \"Well Position,\" and \"Sample Name\"). Choose the desired file location where the results of the run will be stored.\nClick on the \"Apply to Assay\" button and then the \"Save to Library\" button to save the program. Close the panel to continue.",
    "Back at the \"Assign Plate Contents\" page, click on the \"Create New Results Group\" link under \"Results Groups.\"\nName the program \"FPCR-CGE Results Groups.\"\nUnder \"Available Attributes,\" select the desired attributes that will appear in the file name (such as \"Assay Name\"). Choose the desired file location where the results of the run will be stored.\nClick on the \"Apply to Assay\" button and then the \"Save to Library\" button to save the program. Close the panel to continue.\nSet up the program for an electrophoresis run by following the steps below.\n\t\nGo to the dashboard and click on the \"Create New Plate\" icon.\nName the run as desired (for easy reference, include the date, cell line, and gene name). Select the following options: Number of wells, 96; Plate Type, Fragment; Capillary Length, 50 cm; and Polymer, POP7. Click on the \"Assign Plate Content\" button.\nLabel each well of the sample as desired (e.g., a sample can be named \"NC\" to indicate that the well is a negative control).\nUnder the \"Assays,\" \"File Name Conventions,\" and \"Results Groups\" boxes, click the \"Add from Library\" link and select the programs created in step 5.1.3 to 5.1.17.\nHighlight all the wells to be analyzed and select the relevant programs under \"Assays,\" \"File Name Conventions,\" and \"Results Groups\" by checking the boxes next to them.\nBefore loading the plate on the tray of the genetic analyzer, apply the rubber seal on the 96-well plate and put the sealed plate in the plastic case that comes with the genetic analyzer.",
    "Push the \"Tray\" button at the front of the genetic analyzer, and when the tray reaches the front of the equipment, open the door and load the encased plate on the tray. Ensure that the plate is locked in place and then close the door.\nClick on the \"Link Plate for Run\" button.\nIn the \"Load Plates for Run\" page, do a final check to ensure that all the reagents and conditions are correct and in order.\nClick on the \"Start Run\" button. Each run of 24 samples (the first 3x8 wells of the 96-well plate) takes less than 55 min to complete.\n6. Analysis of the Electropherogram to Determine Base-pair Differences\nWhen the capillary gel electrophoresis run is complete, open the analysis software to analyze the results.\nClick on the \"Add Samples to Project\" icon and search for the folder containing the run files. Recall from step 5.1.12 the assigned location of the results files.\nSelect all the results files of each injection in the completed run and click on the \"Add to List\" button; the names of these files begin with \"Inj\" and contain the details of the run.\nClick the \"Add and Analyze\" button to proceed with the analysis.\nSelect all the samples in the run by clicking on the first sample and dragging the cursor down to the last sample and then click the \"Display Plots\" icon.\nTo check the quality of the size standard, open the orange channel of the results by checking the orange icon and unchecking the rest of the colored icons; this is important to ensure that the size-calling is accurate and reliable.\nTo view the peaks corresponding to the fragments derived from the untargeted control and the targeted clones, check the blue and green icons to open readings from these channels.",
    "Place the cursor over the horizontal axis of the first results plot and right-click to select \"Full View.\" Scroll down to view all the results at a glance to determine if there is any major problem with the run. To zoom in on a specific range of values, right-click the mouse on the relevant axis of the plot, choose \"Zoom To…,\" and key in the range of values of interest.\n\tNOTE: One potential major problem is that all the samples give low intensity peaks. This is usually due to the prolonged storage of fluorophore-labeled amplicons prior to the capillary electrophoresis run or the over-dilution of amplicons, which can easily be rectified by repeating the PCR step or by diluting the amplicons using a lower dilution factor, respectively.\nTo save the results, follow the steps described below.\n\t\nEnsure that the blue and green channels are selected and click on the \"Sizing Table\" icon.\nSave the table of values in tab-delimited text (.txt) format by opening \"File\" and choosing \"Export Table.\" Name the file accordingly and select the file location of choice.\nTo save the plots of the run in PDF format, go to \"File\" and click on the \"Print\" option. Choose the relevant PDF writer and press \"Print.\" Name the file accordingly and select the file location of choice.\nTo calculate the difference in the size of the fragments derived from untargeted wildtype control and the CRISPR/Cas9-targeted clones, follow the steps described below.",
    "Open the tab delimited text (.txt) file from step 6.9.2 with a spreadsheet program. The table should include these four important columns: \"Dye/Sample Peak\" (indicating a blue or green channel), \"Sample File Name\" (the first characters indicate the well or sample name), \"Size\" (indicating the size of the fragment called), and \"Height\" (indicating the fluorescence intensity of the peak).\nTo single out relevant peaks, exclude those that are not in the expected size range.\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, indel mutations rarely result in more than a 100-bp difference in size; thus, peaks whose size differs by more than 100 bp from the wildtype control peak (dominant peak in the green channel) are excluded. This can be easily done by using the \"Between\" option under the \"Conditional Formatting\" function in the spreadsheet.\nTo remove non-specific peaks, which are indistinguishable from background level, use the \"Less Than\" option under the \"Conditional Formatting\" function in the spreadsheet program to exclude peaks whose heights are lower than 2,000 units. This cut-off value has been empirically determined and can therefore be adjusted where deemed fit.\nCalculate the difference in fragment size between each of the resulting peaks in the blue channel (CRISPR/Cas9-targeted clones) and the sole peak in the green channel (untargeted wildtype control) by subtracting the latter from the former.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to use values attributed to each capillary electrophoresis sample, as there may be inter-sample differences in the fragment size of the wildtype control.",
    "Round off the values to the nearest integer to determine the number of base pairs that have been inserted into or deleted from, if any, the genomic sequence in question. When knocking out a gene is of interest, select clones whose indel mutations are not of multiples of 3 bp to ensure that there is frameshift in the coding sequence.\n7. Verification of the Knockout Status of Clones\nExpand individual knockout clones from the 96-well plate (from steps 2.4 and 2.6) to a 24-well plate by trypsinizing the cells using 25 µL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubating at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 125 µL of medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) to the trypsinized cells and resuspend thoroughly.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15-mL tube and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove as much of the medium as possible using vacuum suction or a pipette, resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of medium, and transfer the cell suspension to a well of a 24-well plate. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until the cells reach 80-90% confluence.\nExpand the individual clones serially from the 24-well plate to a 6-well plate and from the 6-well plate to a 10-cm dish when they reach 80 - 90% confluence by repeating steps 7.1 to 7.4, using the following volumes: 50 µL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and 150 µL of medium (for expanding from the 24-well plate to the 6-well plate) and 200 µL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and 1 mL of medium (for expanding from the 6-well plate to the 10-cm dish).\nHarvest the clones when they reach 80 - 90% confluence by trypsinizing the cells using 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.",
    "Add 5 mL of medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) to the trypsinized cells and resuspend thoroughly.\nTransfer the cell suspension equally into two 15-mL tubes, centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and remove the medium as much as possible. One portion of the cells is for genomic DNA extraction and the other is for total protein extraction.\nFor verification via Sanger sequencing, follow the steps described below.\n\t\nExtract genomic DNA from the clones as described previously12.\nPerform PCR amplification of the region spanning the CRISPR/Cas9 target site, as described in section 3.2, but use unlabeled primers. Do not use labeled primers for this step, as the fluorescence from the tag will interfere with the subsequent Sanger sequencing step.\nPurify the amplicons using a PCR clean-up kit, as described previously12.\nSequence the purified amplicons using the PCR primers used in step 7.9.2 to determine the genotype of the clones, as described previously12.\nFor verification via Western blot analysis, extract total protein from the wildtype cells and targeted clones, as described previously12.\n\t\nPerform Western blot analysis using appropriate antibodies against the protein of the target gene, as described previously12; a true knockout clone is devoid of the expression of the protein.\nSubscription Required.
