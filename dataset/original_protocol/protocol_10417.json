    "The authors verify that the Indiana University Institutional Review Board approved the study (protocol # 1610743422) and written informed consent was obtained.\nNOTE: The SSHM was integrated into a repeated measures design that is intended to investigate changes among dependent variables within subjects at 0 h, 2 h, and 24 h post-intervention compared to individual pre-intervention values. This study design allows researchers to track changes for a 24 h period, which is the typical timeframe between athletic practices. In the present study, soccer players were randomly assigned to either a soccer heading (n = 18) or a soccer kicking group (n = 16).\n1. Setup\nFollowing baseline measurement collection (pre-intervention), begin the SSHM with the positioning of a soccer ball launcher approximately 40 ft away from the subject, as well as ensuring the soccer ball is inflated to 9 psi.\nThe face of the machine displays two identical dials, which regulate the speed of the left and right wheels, and an on/off switch in between them. Set both these dials to a standardized speed of choice.\n\tNOTE: For this demonstration purpose, the ball traveling speed has been set to 30 mph. This speed was chosen as it simulates a soccer throw-in from the sideline to midfield. Soccer players frequently perform this maneuver during practice and games.\nPlace 3 inch blocks underneath the wheels of the ball launcher to allow for the desired trajectory (no blocks needed for kicking subjects). Once this is complete, the ball launcher is then angled to 40°, which is measured as the angle between the ground and the midline of the rotating wheels.\n\tNOTE: The angle measurement is taken with a goniometer, and the machine can be adjusted after loosening a knob located along the blue rails where the soccer ball is loaded.",
    "Once the soccer machine is properly set, fit the subjects with a triaxial accelerometer embedded within a head-band pocket and positioned directly below the external occipital protuberance (inion) to monitor linear and rotational head accelerations.\nStart up the corresponding software for the accelerometer, and enter the subject’s information accordingly. At this point, the subject is ready to begin the familiarization trials of the intervention (heading, kicking).\n2. Familiarization trials\nPosition the subject approximately 40 ft in front of the ball launcher.\nBe sure to explain to the subject that the ball launcher will volley the soccer ball to them and that they simply need to simulate intervention contact with the ball (i.e., heading subjects will catch the ball with their hands in front of their forehead before head-to-ball contact is made, kicking subjects will “trap” the ball on the ground with their foot instead of volleying the ball back, and standing subjects will remain static and not make contact with the ball).\nWhen the subject understands and feels ready, have the researcher turn the ball launcher on, load the soccer ball onto the blue rails, and finally push the ball into the rotating wheels after a 3-2-1 countdown.\nAfter stopping the ball as described previously (step 2.2), have the subject roll the ball back.\nRepeat steps 2.3 and 2.4 two to four additional times (no rest time required between) to ensure that the subject positioning is correct and interaction with the ball will be safe and controlled. This concludes the familiarization trials.\n3. Intervention",
    "Verbally confirm that the subject is ready. Once confirmed, give instructions to the heading subjects to only make forehead contact with the ball; tell the subjects to avoid potential impacts to the crown, parietal, and temporal lobes. Instruct the kicking subjects to kick the ball only while it is in flight as ball contact with the ground will attenuate the subsequent impact to the foot.\nInstruct both heading and kicking subjects to volley the ball to a target (additional researcher) approximately half the distance between them and the machine. As best they can, ask subjects to do this in a manner that will mimic the arched trajectory the ball took during its flight toward the subject.\nActivate the triaxial accelerometer and begin the recording.\nLoad the soccer ball onto the blue rails, push the ball into the rotating wheels after a 3-2-1 countdown, and make sure appropriate contact is made.\nRepeat step 3.4 nine more times with a 60 s rest in between bouts. If the subject forgoes interaction with the ball (due to inopportune placement or suspected contact with the body in an area that must be avoided), then volley the ball to the subject again promptly, without any rest period.\nIn between each head contact with the ball, verify that the triaxial accelerometer registered an impact (using triaxial software; kicking subjects should not register G-force).\nOnce the intervention is concluded, turn off the ball launcher and stop the triaxial recording (important, as the movement required to remove the headband could record another “impact”). Once the recording has stopped, remove the headband.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
