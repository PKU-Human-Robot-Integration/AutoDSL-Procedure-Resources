    "Cell culture and transfectionPlate cells on 12-well plate with an 18-mm glass coverslip on the bottom. Optimize plate density to reach approximately 40-60% of confluence within 24 h.Transfect cells with the chosen Cameleon when they are at 40-60% of confluence. For HeLa cells, we used TransIT®-LT1 (3 µl of reagent for each µg of cDNA used) as transfection reagent and 1 µg of cDNA (the volume required depends on the cDNA concentration).Perform experiments after 24-48 h.Optimization of the perfusion chamberDrug perfusion ensures the best mixing and keeps cells in fresh and warmed solution, if perfusion is correctly set. To optimize the perfusion system, follow these tips:Locate the pump at the same height and close to the microscope;Keep the tubes as short as possible;Set the flow rate at 2-3 ml/min;To check the flow of the perfusion system, it is possible to add a 1-2 ml solution containing phenol red (0.3 mM in water) into the chamber, attach the in-flow and out-flow tubes and perfuse water. If the chamber solution is totally exchanged, turning from red to transparent in less than 1 min, the perfusion is correctly set.Ca2+-imaging experiment: SOCE activationRemove cells from the incubator, eliminate the medium and rinse cells twice with extracellular medium containing 1 mM CaCl2.Add 1 ml of extracellular medium containing 1 mM CaCl2 to the open-topped chamber.To focus and check cells’ health status, use bright-field illumination. Use fluorescence illumination to choose a field of view containing at least 2-4 transfected cells. To allow equilibration of cells in the saline, perfuse them with the first solution you will use for 2 min before starting the recordings session.",
    "Notes: The requirements that should be satisfied by the cells to image are:Donor and acceptor fluorescence needs to be at least two-fold of that of the background;Donor and acceptor fluorescence should not be the brightest since high fluorescence (typically 7 times or more the background values) level are associated with cells expressing an excess of the probe that can interfere with the cellular healthy state.  In our microscope, we work with 200-300 ms exposure time, binning 4, 20-50% of LED intensity. However, these parameters are strongly dependent on the experimental set-up and must be adjusted to satisfy the conditions expressed at points a and b. Collect images every 20 s for a couple of min, to record the resting [Ca2+]. For the experiments described in this protocol, the acquisition rate is 0.5-1 Hz (i.e., one images every 1 or 2 s); however, to avoid unnecessary photobleaching, the recording rate of this step can be slowed down to one image every 20-30 s.To trigger influx of Ca2+ from PM (i.e., SOCE activation), the intracellular stores must be depleted. To induce store depletion, without activation of IP3Rs, SERCA pump blockers are usually employed. Mainly two types of blockers are used: a reversible one, i.e., cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) or an irreversible one i.e., thapsigargin (TG). CPA is used at a final concentration of 20-50 µM and TG of 100 nM. Thus, treat cells with SERCA pump inhibitors at least for 7 min in a Ca2+-free, EGTA (600 μM)-containing extracellular medium. This step will deplete the store, allowing STIM1 puncta formation and their translocation to the PM, where ORAI1 is located. The store depletion can be performed either offline, i.e., maintaining cells at 37 °C in the oven, or recorded at the microscope.",
    "In the latter case, treatment of cells with SERCA inhibitor will cause a slow decrease of [Ca2+]ER that is observed as small and slow increase of [Ca2+] in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments.To allow the entrance of Ca2+ through ORAI1, cells are then perfused with the same medium, with or without the SERCA inhibitor (if a reversible SERCA blocker has been used, it should be added also in this saline), and challenged with a solution containing CaCl2 1.5 mM (Figures 2B-2E). The Ca2+ re-addition will cause an increase of R in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments.Note: If store depletion is achieved by adding the SERCA pump inhibitor offline, the pre-incubation with the inhibitor should be performed at 37 °C, in the absence of CO2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200119/20200119002722_6685.jpgFigure 2. Ca2+ imaging with a Cameleon. A. Schematic representation of a Cameleon structure and function. Ca2+ binding to CaM triggers its conformational change that, in turn, induces the binding of CaM to M13 forcing the CFP (donor) and the YFP (acceptor) in closer proximity (and thus increasing the energy transfer between the two FPs). B-E. Representative SOCE activation experiment in SH-SY5Y cells expressing the cytosolic Cameleon, D3cpv. Cells were pre-incubated with thapsigargin (TG, 100 nM, the irreversible SERCA blocker) for 7 min in a Ca2+-free extracellular medium containing EGTA 600 μM. The experiment starts perfusing cells with Ca2+-free extracellular medium containing EGTA 600 μM for 1 min, followed, where indicated by the same medium without EGTA and with 1.5 mM CaCl2 instead. B. Fluorescent microscope donor and acceptor fluorescence images taken with a 40x oil objective. Scale Bar = 10 μm. C.

Plot of ΔR/R0 values kinetic of the cell indicated by the ROI.Ca2+-imaging experiment: PM-potential-independent SOCE Remove cells from the incubator, eliminate the medium and rinse cells twice with extracellular medium containing 1 mM CaCl2.Add 1 ml of extracellular medium containing 1 mM CaCl2 to the open-topped chamber.To focus and check cells’ health status, use bright-field illumination. Use fluorescence illumination to choose a field of view containing at least 2-4 transfected cells. To allow equilibration of cells in the saline, perfuse them with the first solution you will use for 2 min before starting the recordings session (see note above, Step C3).Collect images every 1-20 s for a couple of min, to record the resting [Ca2+]. For the experiments described in this protocol, the acquisition rate is 0.5-1 Hz; however, to avoid unnecessary photobleaching, the recording rate of this step can be slowed down to one image every 20-30 s.Since the driving force for Ca2+ entry is strongly affected by differences in PM potential, altering the rate and the extent of SOCE (Penner et al., 1993), the evaluation of PM-potential-independent SOCE, requires the substitution the extracellular medium with a K+-based medium (where NaCl is iso-osmotically substituted by KCl; see Recipes for details). In these conditions, the PM potential collapses, nullifying differences of PM potential among cells. Clearly this latter protocol can be used in cells devoid of Voltage Gated Ca2+ Channels because, if they were expressed, they cause a major, SOCE independent, Ca2+ influx.  To trigger influx of Ca2+ from PM independent from PM potential (i.e., SOCE activation), the intracellular stores must be emptied using CPA or TG, as explained before.",
    "Thus, treat cells with SERCA pump inhibitors at least for 7 min in a Ca2+-free, EGTA (600 μM)-containing K+-based medium saline. As mentioned, the store depletion can be performed either offline, i.e., maintaining cells at 37 °C in the oven, or recorded at the microscope.To allow the entrance of Ca2+ through ORAI1, cells are then perfused with the same medium, with or without the SERCA inhibitor (when the reversible SERCA blocker has been used, it should be added also n this second buffer), and challenged with a solution containing CaCl2 3 mM. Indeed, since also the driving force for Ca2+ decreased when a K+-based medium is used, the extracellular [Ca2+] used to visualize SOCE must be doubled in respect to the classical SOCE activation protocol (from 1.5 to 3 mM). The Ca2+ re-addition will cause an increase of R in the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments.Ca2+-imaging experiment: ER Ca2+ release via IP3R activation Remove cells from the incubator, eliminate the medium and rinse cells twice with extracellular medium containing 1 mM CaCl2.Add 1 ml of extracellular medium containing 1 mM CaCl2 to the open-topped chamber.To focus and check cells’ health status, use bright-field illumination. Use fluorescence illumination to choose a field of view containing at least 2-4 transfected cells. To allow equilibration of cells in the saline, perfuse them with the first solution you will use for 2 min before starting the recordings session (see note above, Step C3).Collect images every 1-20 s for a couple of minutes time, to record the resting [Ca2+]. For the experiments described in this protocol, the acquisition rate is 0.5-1 Hz; however, to avoid unnecessary photobleaching, the recording rate of this step can be slowed down to one image every 20-30 s.",
    "To trigger only ER Ca2+ release (without SOCE contribution), cells should be first perfused for 1 minute with Ca2+-free, EGTA (600 μM)-containing medium.Then cells are stimulated by perfusing with medium containing an IP3-generating agonist. These drugs activate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) causing hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). The IP3 generated mediates the release of Ca2+ from IP3Rs, decreasing [Ca2+] in the ER and thus causing transient [Ca2+] increase in cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. Different drugs can be used to elicit IP3Rs activation depending on cell type. For HeLa cells, we use histamine at a final concentration of 10-100 µM (Figures 3A-3F) that is perfused in the extracellular medium containing EGTA, 1 minute after the perfusion of the same medium without the agonist. The usage of 100 µM of histamine ensures the maximal stimulation of IP3R. This drug should be freshly prepared in the extracellular medium containing EGTA 600 µM or CaCl2 1 mM at a final concentration of 20 mM (Figures 3G-3J).The stimulus is removed, perfusing the saline without the agonist.Ca2+-imaging experiment: ER Ca2+ release via RyR activation Remove cells from the incubator, eliminate the medium and rinse cells twice with extracellular medium containing 1 mM CaCl2.Add 1 ml of extracellular medium containing 1 mM CaCl2 to the open-topped chamber.To focus and check cells’ health status, use bright-field illumination. Use fluorescence illumination to choose a field of view containing at least 2-4 transfected cells. To allow equilibration of cells in the saline, perfuse them with the first solution you will use for 2 min before starting the recordings session (see note above, Step C3).Collect images every 1-20 s for a couple of minutes time, to record the resting [Ca2+]. For the experiments described in this protocol, the acquisition rate is 0.",
    "5-1 Hz; however, to avoid unnecessary photobleaching, the recording rate of this step can be slowed down to one image every 20-30 s.In excitable cells, it is possible to activate RyR, substituting the IP3-generating agonist with caffeine. This drug should be freshly prepared in the extracellular medium containing EGTA 600 µM or CaCl2 1 mM at a final concentration of 20 mM (Figures 3G-3J). To trigger only ER Ca2+ release (without SOCE contribution), cells should be first perfused for 1 minute with Ca2+-free, EGTA (600 μM)-containing medium. The usage of 20 mM of Caffeine in the extracellular medium containing CaCl2 1 mM ensures the maximal stimulation of RyR.The stimulus is removed, perfusing the saline without the agonist, once the Ca2+ response is observed. Typically, 1-2 min of Caffeine perfusion is sufficient.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200119/20200119002331_3598.jpgFigure 3. Mitochondrial Ca2+ imaging with mCerulean3-containing Cameleon, instead of CFP. A-F.

Cells were first perfused for 1 min in medium containing 1 mM CaCl2 followed by a Ca2+-free medium containing 600 μM EGTA for the same time. The IP3-dependent ER Ca2+ release was triggered by perfusing 100 μM histamine (Hist), indicated by the arrow. At the end of the experiments, probe calibration was performed to measure Rmin and Rmax. To achieve Rmin, HeLa cells were permeabilized with digitonin (Dig, 100 μM) in an intracellular-like medium containing EGTA (600 μM). To achieve Rmax, an intracellular-like medium containing 5 mM CaCl2 was perfused. A. Fluorescent microscope cpV and mCerulean3 fluorescence images taken with a 40× oil objective. Scale Bar = 10 μm.

Kinetics of R-values in the cell indicated by the ROI. J. Kinetics of ΔR/R0 values in the cell indicated by the ROI.Probe calibrationThe final step of the protocol is the indicator calibration, that consists in the measurement of both the minimum R, under Ca2+-free conditions (Rmin), and the maximum R, under conditions of saturating Ca2+ (Rmax). These Rmin and Rmax values represent the minimal FRET and the maximal FRET reachable with the probe. If the Kd for Ca2+ of the probe is known this step allows the conversion of the R-values into [Ca2+]. This protocol is also useful when a comparison between GECIs with different biophysical properties (i.e., different Kd and DR) is performed. For this part of the protocol, two different approaches can be used.Digitonin-based protocol: The best one consists of cell permeabilization with digitonin in Ca2+-free intracellular-like medium (Figures 3A-3F). Digitonin is a steroidal detergent that permeabilizes membrane, preferentially those with high cholesterol content such as the PM.",
    "The final concentration and exposure time vary depending on the organelles investigated.After permeabilization, cells are perfused with the same medium without digitonin and supplemented with EGTA (600 µM), to obtain Rmin.Finally, cells are perfused with a saturating CaCl2 concentration (3-5 mM) in intracellular-like medium, to obtain Rmax. Of note, for mitochondrial probe calibration, FCCP should be added in each solution of the calibration step. This drug is a mitochondrial uncoupler that, collapsing mitochondrial membrane potential, allows the equilibration of extra-mitochondrial [Ca2+] with that in the matrix. It is used at a final concentration of 5-10 µM. This concertation ensures a complete mitochondria depolarization.Ionomycin-based protocol The second approach consists of cell treatment with 5 µM ionomycin and 3 mM EGTA, to reach Rmin and then with 10 mM of CaCl2 intracellular-like medium, to obtain the Rmax. Ionomycin is a Ca2+ ionophore that exchanges two protons for one Ca2+.Generally, an accurate estimation of Rmin and Rmax requires 4-10 min of imaging that is the average time in which R-values are stable, meaning that an equilibrium between the [Ca2+] of the organelle and that of the perfused saline has been reached.Notes: Digitonin is a detergent used to permeabilize the PM to bring the cytoplasm or the lumen of organelles in equilibrium with the perfused medium. Since the permeabilization efficiency depends on organelles’ membrane composition and cell density on the coverslips, digitonin concentration and exposure time must be assessed for each experiment in order to avoid probe leakage from the imaged cellular compartment. Thus, load cells with a cytosolic chemical probe, e.g., Fluo-4 (see Figure 4), and transfect cells with the desired Cameleon.",
    "Since Ca2+ ions are smaller than chemical dyes, the correct concentration and exposure time of digitonin will be the one that causes the exit of only the chemical dye, without affecting the localization and the amount of the expressed Cameleon. For HeLa cells, we used 10 µM digitonin for 30 s for cytosolic Cameleon or 50-100 µM digitonin for 1 min for mitochondrial Cameleon; To calibrate mitochondria-targeted probes it is necessary to mimic the unique features of the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, since the pH is about 8 inside these organelles, it is recommended to use an intracellular-like medium with 20 mM Tris (in substitution of HEPES) and pH 8 at 37 °C. Ionomycin use requires some cautions: In case of manual addition, use a Ca2+-free extracellular medium containing EGTA, at least at the same concentration of [Ca2+] present in the chamber medium, to achieve Rmin; When, in a medium at pH 7.4, EGTA binds Ca2+, it releases two protons (Martell and Sillen, 1964) that cause a pH drop that sometimes can impact on both donor and acceptor emitted fluorescence. Furthermore, since ionomycin exploits the proton gradient to carry Ca2+, pH changes saturate the ability of the ionophore to transport Ca2+. To avoid this, it is possible to counteract the pH change by adding alkalinizing agents (i.e., addition of Tris-HCl), allowing further entrance of Ca2+; The treatment of cells with ionomycin and EGTA causes Ca2+ release from the ER, thus an increase in the R can be recorded with a cytosolic/nuclear Cameleon; Being a Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin is saturable (Fasolato and Pozzan, 1989). Thus, it is advisable to verify the achievement of a real Rmin value comparing this value with the Rmin obtained by incubating cells for 30 min in extracellular medium containing 5 µM BAPTA-AM.",
    "BAPTA-AM is a Ca2+-specific chelator with a faster kinetic compared to EGTA; The addition of ionomycin and high [Ca2+] to evaluate Rmax can lead to the swelling of organelles, cellular blebbing, and eventually cell death. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200119/20200119002300_1829.jpgFigure 4.
