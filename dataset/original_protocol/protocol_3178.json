    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRNA extraction from subcellular fractions\nTiming: 1 day\nThe protocol described in this section was used to investigate if the human YTHDC1 m6A reader regulates the expression level of specific RNAs (coding for HSPs and other proteins) by acting directly on chromatin at their site of transcription. It has been optimized to obtain the cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, and chromatin-associated fractions from HeLa cells. First, cells were lysed to obtain the cytoplasmic fraction and nuclei. Next, nuclei were isolated and lysed to sequentially collect the nucleoplasm (the soluble fraction of the nucleus) and the chromatin-associated fractions. Cell fractionation was performed in parallel with WT cells and knockdown cells for the m6A reader YTHDC1. An aliquot of each of the collected fraction was immediately taken for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses, before TRIzol was added for RNA extraction. This protocol allows to isolate and purify the chromatin-associated RNAs. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses (not described in details here) were used to validate the purity of the subcellular fractions. Relative RNA levels were then monitored using RT-qPCR analyses. All steps were performed at 4°C to limit degradation of proteins and RNA. Additionally, RNase inhibitor was added to all buffers to avoid RNA degradation. The centrifuge was pre-cooled to 4°C and labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes put on ice.\n72 h after transfection, harvest the transfected cells.\nUsing a cell scraper, gently scrape the cells and recover all the cells (with the floating cells).\nTransfer the cell suspension in labeled 15 mL polypropylene conical tube.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 400 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend gently the cells in 500 μL of cold PBS (without calcium and magnesium).",
    "Transfer the cells in labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge the cell suspension at 400 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and keep the cells on ice.\nCritical: Do not freeze the cells at this stage as it could impair the subsequent subcellular fractionation.\nGently resuspend the cell pellet in 400 μL ice-cold fractionation lysis buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nNote: Add DTT and PMSF before the experiments.\nIncubate for 10 min on ice.\nNote: This step must be optimized according to each cell lines (longer incubation can be required depending on the cell type).\nCentrifuge the suspension at 4°C for 5 min at 400 × g.\nCollect the supernatant (corresponding to the cytoplasmic fraction) and store it on ice. Take a 20 μL aliquot for SDS-PAGE analysis.\nWash the pellet.\nGently resuspend the pellet with 200 μL of cold fractionation washing buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nNote: Resuspend the pellet by gently tapping the tube or using a 1 mL pipet tip with pre-cut end.\nCentrifuge at 4°C for 5 min at 400 × g.\nAt the end of the centrifugation, remove the supernatant to obtain a final pellet containing the washed nuclei.\nWhile waiting for the centrifugation, add 1 mL of TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) to the remaining cytoplasmic fraction (380 μL) and vortex thoroughly for 1 min at RT (20°C–22°C). Incubate 2–3 min at RT and flash freeze the sample in liquid nitrogen.\nResuspend the washed nuclei in 200 μL of fractionation nuclear lysis buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Vortex for 30 s and incubate samples for 20 min on ice.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4°C.\nCollect the supernatant (corresponding to the nucleoplasm fraction) and store it on ice. Take a 20 μL aliquot for SDS-PAGE analysis.",
    "The remaining pellet contains the chromatin-associated fraction. Resuspend this fraction in 200 μL of fractionation nuclear lysis buffer and keep it on ice. Take a 20 μL aliquot for SDS-PAGE analysis.\nAdd 1 mL of TRIzol Reagent to the remaining nucleoplasm and chromatin-associated fractions (180 μL) and vortex thoroughly for 1 min at RT (20°C–22°C). Incubate the pellet for 2–3 min at RT (20°C–22°C) and flash freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen.\nPause point: At this step, samples can be stored at −80°C.\nCritical: TRIzol is a cytotoxic chemical that should only be handled inside a fume hood.\nOptional: Note that the fraction obtained in point 11 contains the chromatin-associated fraction and the insoluble nuclear fraction. It is possible to further enrich this fraction in chromatin components by using high salt concentration and a centrifugation step, which allows to recover in the supernatant the soluble chromatin-associated fraction and in the pellet, the nuclear insoluble fraction (that contains nuclear aggregates, membrane proteins). From the pellet obtained in point 11: resuspend the pellet in 200 μL of 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 700 mM NaCl. Vortex 30 sec and incubate 20 min on ice. Centrifuge for 5 min at 20,000 × g at 4°C. The supernatant contains the soluble chromatin associated fraction and the pellet the nuclear insoluble fraction. Recover the supernatant and store it on ice. Resuspend the nuclear insoluble fraction in 200 μL of nuclear lysis buffer and store it on ice.\nAdd 5 μL of 5× loading buffer in each 20 μL aliquots collected in steps 5, 10, and 11. Store the aliquots at −20°C for further SDS-PAGE analyses.

Validation of the purity of cytoplasmic and subnuclear fractions and determination of YTHDC1 subcellular localization",
    "(A and B) The cross contamination between the different enriched fractions was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (A), and Western blot (B) using specific protein markers (i.e., Tubulin β for the cytoplasm, HSF1 for the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm fractions, histone H3 for the chromatin associated fraction. This Figure is part of the Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] of the related publication Timcheva et al., 2022.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: Before proceeding with the RNA extraction, analyze the purity of the subcellular fraction collected by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis using antibody against marker proteins (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). To do so, load one volume (i.e., 4 μL) of cytoplasmic fraction and two volumes (i.e., 8 μL) of nuclear fractions (nucleoplasmic and chromatin associated) to respect the proportions of each fraction. No quantified is required before loading. In our study, we used the following protein markers: Tubulin β for the cytoplasmic fraction, the transcription factor HSF1 for cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic fraction, and histones for the chromatin associated fraction. Note that the western blot analysis also allowed us to show that the m6A reader YTHDC1 is mainly found in the chromatin-associated fraction.\nRNA extraction.\nThaw at RT (20°C–22°C) the frozen samples obtained after the addition of TRIzol (steps 7 and 12) and vortex to homogenize.\nNote: We do not use column-based RNA purification since it should be done at the same time as the fractionation. Indeed, once the subcellular fractions are obtained, RNA extraction must be performed or TRIzol added.\nAdd 0.2 mL of chloroform, vortex thoroughly for 30 s at RT (20°C–22°C) and incubate for 5–10 min.\nCritical: Chloroform is a cytotoxic chemical that should only be handled inside a fume hood.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.",
    "Note: After centrifugation, three phases are obtained. The lower (pink) phase contains the proteins, the interphase (white) contains the DNA and the upper colorless phase contains the RNA. Carefully remove the tubes from the centrifuge so as not to disturb the different phases.\nCarefully transfer the aqueous (upper) phase to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCritical: To avoid contamination with DNA, pipette at the top layer of the aqueous phase, leaving a small volume in direct contact with the interphase.\nAdd 0.5 mL of isopropanol, mix the sample by inverting the tube several times, incubate 10 min at RT (20°C–22°C) and centrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 × g, at 4°C.\nNote: Incubation at 4°C for 30 min or more increases the RNA yield. When working with limiting material, Glycogen or Glycoblue can be added to aid in visualizing pellet.\nRemove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of cold 75% (v/v) ethanol and centrifuge at 7,500 × g for 5 min, at 4°C.\nNote: Do not touch the pellet when removing the supernatant. Do not resuspend the pellet when adding 75% ethanol. Store 75% ethanol at −20°C.\nRemove the supernatant and let the RNA pellet air-dry.\nNote: Remove the maximum of ethanol. Be careful with the pellet which can be easily detached from the bottom of the tube.\nResuspend the pellet in 20 μL of RNase-free water for the cytoplasmic RNAs or 10 μL of RNase-free water for the two other fractions.\nNote: The amount of water depends on the size of the pellet.\nIncubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nDetermine the RNA concentration and the 260/280 O.D. ratio using a NanoDrop UV spectrophotometer.",
    "Note: Spectrophotometers, like the NanoDrop™ One (from ThermoFischer) can be used. More accurate measurements can be obtained using Qubit RNA assays with a Qubit Fluorometer.\nEvaluate the RNA integrity by electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel using the GelGreen Nucleic Acid Stain (Biotium) dye following the manufacturer’s instructions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2948-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Incubate for 20 min at 37°C in a thermocycler (T100 Thermal Cycler, Biorad).\nNote: If the RNA concentration of a sample is lower than 1 μg/mL, prepare all the samples at this lower concentration. DNase treatment can be performed on RNA fractions less than 2 μg.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2948_13.csv\nNext, add 1.88 μL of 50 mM EDTA to the RNA-DNase mixture and incubate 10 min at 70°C in a thermocycler.\nNote: This step inactivates the DNase.\nReverse transcription of RNA.\nHybridize primers to the DNase-treated RNA following the mixture indicated below for 10 min at 65°C in a thermocycler.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2948_14.csv",
    "After incubation, immediately place the samples on ice and proceed to the cDNA synthesis as described below. Using a thermocycler, incubate for 10 min at 25°C, 40 min at 55°C and 5 min at 85°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2948_15.csv\nNote: Oligo-dT or strand-specific primers can be used instead of random primers. If so, refer to the manufacturer instructions for the concentration to be used. The RNA samples are split into two, in order to have the positive control (incubation with reverse transcriptase) and a negative one (no incubation with reverse transcriptase).\nDilute the cDNA fraction at 1:10 for next use by qPCR. Store the resulting diluted cDNA fraction at −20°C.\nNote: qPCR is performed with primers that amplify specific targets to be tested (in our case HSP RNAs) and housekeeping genes (like Actin B). The expression level of HSP RNAs is normalized to that of the housekeeping gene (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section for method used for the quantification). The comparison of the RNA level between WT and YTHDC1 KD cells allows to determine if the protein is involved in the regulation of the expression of the RNA analyzed and if this regulation occurs at the chromatin level (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). In our study, we showed that YTHDC1 is essential for the expression of HSP genes and that its regulation occurs at the chromatin level.\nProtein-driven RNA immunoprecipitation\nTiming: 2 days",
    "In this section, we describe the protocol to immunoprecipitate the RNAs bound by the human m6A RNA binding protein, YTHDC1. RIP protocol was adapted to include the study of the RNAs associated to chromatin. Indeed, we have found that in the classical protocol the degree of sonication is not sufficient to solubilize most of these RNAs. A series of experiments was performed to ensure that our protocol enabled to include the chromatin-associated RNAs in the study. The experiment was performed with WT and m6A methylase knockdown cells. This allowed us to validate that YTHDC1 reader targets m6A methylated RNA, in particular HSP. Indeed, thanks to the experiments described in the first part of the protocol, we have shown that YTHDC1 is involved in regulating the expression of these RNAs at the chromatin level.\nCross-link and collect the cells.\nRemove the cell dishes from the CO2 incubator. Inside a fume hood, in ambient light, add 540 μL of 37% formaldehyde dropwise (to reach a final concentration of formaldehyde of 1%).\nCritical: The methanol-free formaldehyde used should be less than 1 month old. As it is a cytotoxic chemical, it should only be handled inside a fume hood.\nIncubate for 15 min at RT (20°C–22°C) under gentle agitation.\nQuench the reaction with 1 mL of 2.5 M glycine to obtain a final glycine concentration of 125 mM. Incubate for 5 min at RT (20°C–22°C) under agitation.\nUsing a cell scraper and at room temperature, collect the cells into a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cells for 3 min at 1,250 × g at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 20 mL of cold PBS.",
    "Centrifuge the cells as described above and wash a second time the pellet with 10 mL of cold PBS. Keep the washed cells pellet on ice.\nPause point: At this step, samples can be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.\nNote: The PBS used is without calcium and magnesium. The supernatants containing formaldehyde are disposed of in special containers (for toxic waste disposal).\nCells lysis and extract preparation.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 400 μL of RIP lysis buffer and incubate 10 min on ice.\nSonicate the sample in a cold-water bath sonicator (Active motif) for 10 min (30 s “on”/ 30 s “off” sonication cycle at 30% amplitude).\nCentrifuge the sample at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and collect the supernatant in a new labeled microcentrifuge tube.\nResuspend the remaining pellet in 400 μL of RIP lysis buffer and sonicate as describe in 18.b.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Combine the supernatant to the one collected in step 18.c.\nRepeat the steps 18.d and 18.e. to obtain a 1.2 mL final volume of cell lysate.\nNote: The number of sonication cycles is protein-dependent and thus needs to be adapted from 1 cycle of sonication to multiple cycles. 3 cycles of sonication are ideal for the recovery of chromatin-associated SATIII RNAs associated with YTHDC1. Less cycles of sonication leads to a poor recovery of these RNAs.\nDNase treatment.\nAdd 133 μL of DNase Buffer and 700 Units of DNase I (RNase free, special for RIP, Sigma D7291) to the 1.2 mL clarified lysate. Incubate for 1 h at 30°C.\nStop the DNase reaction with 80 μL EDTA 0.5 M.\nCentrifuge the sample 5 min at 15,000 × g at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant into a new microcentrifuge tube.\nImmunoprecipitation.",
    "Incubate 600 μL of the DNase treated lysate with either 10 μg of antibody anti-human YTHDC1 (Bethyl) or 10 μg of irrelevant IgG (from human serum) at 4°C for 1h.\nDuring this incubation step, prepare the protein A-Sepharose beads.\nPipet a volume equivalent to 25 μL of protein A-Sepharose (nProtein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow) for each immunoprecipitation sample.\nWash 3 times with 250 μL (10 times the Sepharose volume) of RIP lysis buffer by inverting the tube 5 to 10 times and spinning at 500 × g, 2 min at 4°C.\nAfter the last wash, add 4 volumes of RIP lysis buffer to the protein A-Sepharose beads (100 μL of RIP lysis buffer for each 25 μL of protein A-Sepharose, the final concentration is 20% (w/v).\nCritical: In order to keep the full potential of the protein A-Sepharose beads during the immunoprecipitation, all centrifugations should be performed at 500 × g. Do not vortex the beads.\nNote: Protein A Dynabeads can be used as an alternative. In that case, the qPCR signals from the control IP with the irrelevant IgG will be very low and potentially not measurable (because of less background compared to the protein A-Sepharose beads). In that case normalization must be done with the input sample (i.e., the DNase treated lysate before IP).\nAfter the 1h incubation, add 125 μL of a 20% prewashed protein A-Sepharose beads to the lysate and incubate at 4°C for another 1 h.\nCentrifuge the sample at 500 × g for 2 min and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads by adding 1 mL of RIP lysis buffer. Mix gently by inverting the tube 5 to 6 times.\nCentrifuge the sample at 500 × g for 2 min and remove the supernatant.",
    "Repeat steps 20.e and 20.f to perform the second wash.\nWash the beads by adding 1 mL of RIP lysis buffer containing 500 mM of NaCl and 10 U/mL RiboLock. Mix gently by inverting the tubes 5 to 6 times.\nCentrifuge the sample at 500 × g for 2 min and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads by adding 1 mL of RIP wash buffer. Mix gently by inverting the tube 5 to 6 times.\nCentrifuge the sample at 500 × g for 2 min and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads by adding 1 mL of TE-DTT buffer. Mix gently by inverting the tube 5 to 6 times.\nCentrifuge the sample at 500 × g for 2 min and remove the supernatant.\nElute the immunopurified material by adding 100 μL of RIP first elution buffer and incubating at 65°C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 30 s and transfer the supernatant into a new microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 150 μL of RIP second elution buffer onto the beads, mix well by vortexing 10 s. Centrifuge the sample at 10,000 × g for 30 s. Collect the supernatant and pool it with the one collected in step 20.m.\nReverse cross-link, protease treatment.\nReverse crosslink the sample by incubation at 65°C overnight (12h–16h).\nOptional: The reverse crosslink step can also be done for 4 h at 67°C.\nAdd 200 μL of RIP_TE_DTT_Proteinase K buffer and incubate for 30 min at 65°C.\nOptional: The Proteinase K treatment step can also be done alternatively for 2 h at 37°C or for 1 h at 42°C.\nRNA extraction.\nAdd 55 μL of 3 M NaOAc pH 5.2 to each sample.\nUnder a fume hood, add 500 μL of Acid-Phenol:Chloroform:isoamyl alcohol pH 4,5 (125:24:1), mix well by vortexing for 10 s.",
    "Centrifuge the sample for 5 min at 10,000 × g RT (20°C–22°C).\nCollect the upper phase containing the nucleic acids to a new tube.\nUnder a fume hood, add 500 μL of chloroform. Mix well with a 10-s vortexing.\nCentrifuge the sample for 5 min at 10,000 × g RT (20°C–22°C).\nCollect the upper phase containing the nucleic acids to a new tube.\nPrecipitate the nucleic acids by adding 1 mL of 100% (v/v) ethanol and 2 μL of glycogen (20 mg/mL). Incubate at −80°C for 20 min and then centrifuge at 4°C for 20 min at 10,000 × g.\nOptional: A 2-h precipitation of the nucleic acids at −20°C can also be used, followed by a 20-min centrifugation at 4°C at 10,000 × g.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 1 mL 70% (v/v) ethanol.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 × g, 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the RNA in 20 μL of TE with 5 mM DTT and 10 U/mL RiboLock.\nPause point: At this step, RNAs can be stored for 4–6 weeks at −20°C.\nThe purified RNAs are then analyzed by RT-qPCR as described in steps 15–16.

    "Note: Immunoprecipitation is performed with an antibody against the protein of interest (here human YTHDC1) and in parallel with human irrelevant IgG as a negative control. RNA obtained from each RIP are then extracted and used for RT-qPCR. For the qPCR, use primers that amplify specific targets to be analyzed (HSP RNAs in our study), and a control RNA (tRNA in our study for the RIP analysis, it can be housekeeping RNAs like Actin B or Tubulin β provided that they are not a target of the immunoprecipitated protein and that their expression does not vary with the conditions analyzed. Other non-coding RNAs like U2, U6 can also be used). To calculate the enrichment HSP/tRNA, we used the 2-ΔΔCT method (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section)."
