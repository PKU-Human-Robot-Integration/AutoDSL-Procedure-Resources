Surface biofilms is incubated directly inside non-activated plastic inserts (calWells™, Symcel AB, Sweden) to allow further metabolic measurements, while alginate beads are incubated in Erlenmeyer flasks and planktonic cultures in cell culture tubes and then transferred to plastic wells upon measurements.\nSurface attached biofilm formation has been optimized for the plastic inserts and the planktonic culture preparation has been adapted. The encapsulation of bacteria in alginate beads is done using a modification of previously described protocols.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nThe full workflow is illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2661-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Workflow of preparing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in different growth models\n(A) For planktonic cultures, 5 mL LB is inoculated from −80°C freeze stock and shaken at 180 rpm for 24 h at 37°C. The ON culture is then filtered through a 10 μm syringe filter and adjusted to an OD600 of 0.005 using a spectrophotometer.\n(B) For production of alginate beads, a filtered and OD600 adjusted ON culture is mixed with alginate. Following homogenization, alginate beads containing bacteria are produced by extrusion dropping into a stirred CaCl2 solution and beads are hardened for 1 h before being washed and transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks containing LB medium.\n(C) For production of surface biofilms, a filtered and OD600 adjusted ON culture is pipetted into individual plastic inserts, positioned in a standard 48 well plate and incubated for 24 h in 37°C and shaken at 120 rpm. Following incubation, media is removed, and the wells washed with sterile saline, and then transferred to titanium vials of the calPlate.",
    "Note: Two of the strains used here have an arabinose-inducible promoter. Thus, 0.2% L-arabinose (final concentration) should be added to induce the promoter. Here, we mixed LB with arabinose for inoculation into the calWells™ just prior to insertion in the calScreener™.\nNote: Use plastic inserts of calWells™ for setting up the growth model; that allows a direct measurement of the samples.\nPrepare a planktonic culture\nTiming: 1 h\nFilter the ON culture through a 10 μm syringe filter to ensure a mainly planktonic population.\nMeasure the OD of the filtered ON culture on a spectrophotometer and adjust to a final OD600 of 0.005 in sterile LB supplemented with 0.2% arabinose.\nAdd an aliquot of 200 μL to each plastic insert.\nPosition plastic inserts into titanium vial of the calPlate™ (Symcel AB, Sweden)\nPreparation of surface attached biofilm in plastic inserts\nTiming: 25 h (preparation ∼1 h; incubation ∼24 h)\nFilter the ON culture through a 10 μm syringe filter to ensure a mainly planktonic population.\nMeasure the OD of the filtered ON culture on a spectrophotometer and adjust to a final OD600 of 0.005 in sterile LB.\nFill the sterile plastic inserts (Symcel AB, Sweden) with 200 μL of the OD-adjusted ON culture.\nCover the plastic inserts with parafilm, position them in a 48-well plate and incubate for 24 h at 37°C, 120 rpm for biofilm to develop on the sides and bottom of the insert.\nFollowing incubation, remove planktonic biomass by removing supernatant gently, then washing gently with 200 μL sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl).\nAfter washing, position inserts into titanium vials of the calPlate™ (Symcel AB, Sweden).\nAdd 200 μL fresh LB media supplemented with 0.2% L-arabinose to each plastic insert.\nPreparation of P. aeruginosa encapsulated in alginate beads\nTiming: 26 h (preparation ∼1.5 h; incubation ∼24 h)",
    "Encapsulation of P. aeruginosa in alginate beads follows the procedure as described elsewhere.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] In case of problems forming the spheres see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nFilter the ON culture through a 10 μm syringe filter to ensure a mainly planktonic population.\nMeasure the OD of the filtered ON culture on a spectrophotometer and adjust to an OD600 of 2.\nDilute the OD adjusted culture 20× in a sterile alginate solution (2% w/v) to a final OD600 of 0.1.\nPlace 150 mL of sterile 0.25 M CaCl2 in a 250 mL beaker glass on a magnetic stirrer with a sterile magnet (∼3 cm length).\nSet the magnetic stirrer to 150 rpm and place a 21-gauge needle perpendicular to- and ∼3 cm from the surface of the CaCl2 solution, and ∼1.5 cm from the edge of the beaker.\nConnect the needle to a 20 mL syringe containing the alginate-bacterial solution by sterile silicone tubing (internal diameter = 2 mm).\nMount the syringe into a syringe pump and set the flow rate to 30 mL/h.\nDispense droplets of the alginate-bacteria solution into the stirred CaCl2 solution.\nHarden the spherical beads for 1 h in the 0.25 M CaCl2 solution.\nDiscard the CaCl2 and wash the beads twice by swirling the beads carefully in 50 mL sterile 0.9% saline solution in a beaker.\nTransfer 20 beads to 50 mL prewarmed LB medium in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nIncubate at 37°C and 100 rpm for 24 h.\nTransfer beads to a new beaker and rinse them gently by swirling in 50 mL 0.9% sterile NaCl for <1 min to remove non-embedded bacteria.\nPlace a single bead into a plastic insert (calWell™, Symcel AB).\nPosition plastic inserts into titanium vials of the calPlate™ (Symcel AB, Sweden).",
    "Add 190 μL fresh LB medium supplemented with 0.2% L-arabinose resulting in 200 μL total volume in each well.\nNote: Handle the filled inserts carefully to avoid spilling. It is advised to use sterile tweezers for insert handling to prevent contamination. Liquid on the rim of the vial can interfere with the signal (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nThe calScreener biocalorimetry procedure\nTiming: 1–2 days (or longer)\nIn this step, we set up the calPlate™ with the sample-containing plastic inserts and perform live cell metabolic measurements. Isothermal calorimetry with the calScreener™ allows evaluation of overall metabolic activity of a sample by continuous measuring of heat flow (HF, μW). Samples are prepared prior to insertion and measurement, which can be done for unlimited time, typically 24 h for fast growing cells.\nWe have optimized planktonic culture and a surface attached biofilm model for instrument specific plastic inserts, including cell number and pre-incubation times.\nSetup calPlate™ for measurement\nTiming: 1–2 days (or longer)\nSetup the calPlate™ (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and insert into the calScreener™ for automatic and continuous measurement of released heat. Vials at positions A 1–8 and F 1–8 serve as thermodynamic references and contain sterile medium, that is used for the sampled. Culture and medium controls shall be added separately to vials at sample positions (B1–E8).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2661-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.
