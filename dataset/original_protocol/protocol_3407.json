This is the first major and critical process for the collection of cell-secreted proteins or cell secretome (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: This multi-step process is easily adaptable to collect secretomes from any mammalian cells which can then be used for various downstream applications and proteomic analyses (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nCell seeding.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3171-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of protein secretion pathways\nConventional (ER/Golgi) and non-conventional (multivesicular bodies/MVB) pathways.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3171-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Secretomes and downstream applications\nDAY 0 – Grow cells in 10 cm tissue culture dishes until they reach 70%–90% confluency.\nFor each cell line to be studied, split cells from one dish in two 10 cm dishes and culture for ∼16 h.\nNote: Resuspend cells homogenously to ensure even seeding. Alternatively, count and seed a defined number of cells.\nCritical: Seeding fewer cells may result in low abundance of secreted proteins in the CM, whereas, too many cells will result in cell apoptosis and death.\nCritical: Do not allow cells to reach 100% confluency prior to serum starvation. Addition of serum-free media on 100% confluent cultures will result in apoptotic and dead cells, as well as release of cytosolic proteins into the CM.",
    "Critical: While cell confluency of 70%–90% is the optimum density for SYF and SYF+c-Src cells, different cell lines may proliferate at different rates. Therefore, it is best to optimize cell density and duration of serum-starvation for each cell line. See above (cell cytotoxicity assay[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]) the method we use to evaluate cell death in different conditions.\nSerum starvation.\nDAY 1 – Next morning and while cells are at ∼80% confluency, gently wash attached cells twice with sterile PBS suitable for cell culture or serum-free medium pre-warmed to 23°C.\nNote: Some cell lines attach weakly to plastic and can easily detach following washes with PBS.\nAspirate out the second wash of PBS/medium and add 4 mL of fresh serum-free medium by gently tilting the plate and adding medium at the edge so to avoid the mechanical detachment of cells.\nIncubate cells in a humidified 37°C cell culture incubator containing 5% CO2 for 24–36 h.\nDAY 2 – Collect cells and conditioned media (CM) in the afternoon.\nTransfer CM from each replicate dish in a sterile 15 mL conical tube. Combine CM from both dishes. Total volume of CM should be 8 mL. Keep CM on ice.\nCentrifuge CM at 290 g to pellet any floating detached cells at 23°C.\nTransfer CM to a new 15 mL tube and repeat centrifugation of at 3,220 g for 5 min at 4°C to remove dead cells.\nPause point: Store media at ‒80°C until ready to proceed to step 4.\nFor cell extracts, rinse gently cells once with 7 mL of ice-cold PBS. Remove and repeat with another 7 mL of ice-cold PBS and place dishes on ice for protein extraction.\nLeave PBS on cells until ready for step 5.\nNote: Be cautious because some cells may easily detach following washes with PBS.",
    "Concentration of conditioned media (CM).\nNote: We concentrate media at least 10x using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore Sigma). We use 3 kDa or 10 kDa cut-off units which eliminate small molecular weight proteins from the collected media.\nNote: Ensure unit cut-off is appropriate for the size of proteins tested.\nNote: To concentrate the CM, follow manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/Amicon-Ultra-Centrifugal-Filters,MM_NF-C134281?ReferrerURL = https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F[href=https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/Amicon-Ultra-Centrifugal-Filters,MM_NF-C134281?ReferrerURL%20=%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F]).\nNote: Perform centrifugations at 4°C and chill all materials on wet ice.\nWhen using the Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit[href=https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/Amicon-Ultra-4-Centrifugal-Filter-Unit,MM_NF-UFC800324].\nAdd up to 4 mL of CM (3.5 mL if using 23° fixed-angle rotor) to the filter device, cap the tubes and place them in a centrifuge rotor.\nMake sure to counterbalance the centrifuge.\nIf you use a swinging-bucket rotor, spin the device at 4,000 g maximum for approximately 10–15 min (to achieve 10x concentration of CM).\nFor 10x concentration of 8 mL CM you will end up with 800 μL CM.\nNote: If total CM volume is 8 mL one may use the Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit[href=https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/Amicon-Ultra-15-Centrifugal-Filter-Unit,MM_NF-UFC905008] instead.\nSpin CM in 5-min intervals at 3,220 g and stop when the volume of media in the concentrator reaches 800 μL.\nNote: Observe the volume that remains in the concentrator after each centrifugation and repeat centrifugation step if needed. Record the final volume of the concentrated media (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRemove concentrated CM immediately after final centrifugation for optimal recovery.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3171-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Pause point: Store concentrated CM in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes at ‒80°C until ready for downstream analyses.\nNote: Units can be reused up to 3 times. Follow manufacturer’s instructions.\nProtein extraction from serum-starved cells.\nNote: Protein quantification is routinely used as a method to determine the concentration of protein collected from cell extracts and to equalize protein levels for western blot analyses. We do not use the same method to equalize total protein from conditioned media (CM).\nNote: Although cells are plated in serum-free conditions, traces of albumin may remain in CM and will account for the majority of protein concentration. As an alternative, serum-free cultured cells are collected, lysed, and protein is extracted. The resulting concentration from these extracts is determined and subsequently used to normalize and equalize CM input for western blot analyses.\nNote: CM protein levels can also be normalized based on the cell number; specifically, following collection of CM, serum-starved cells may be trypsinized and counted.\nCritical: Cool down a refrigerated bench-top microcentrifuge to 4°C to spin down protein lysates. Protein degradation occurs if samples are allowed to warm up.\nNote: Include protease and phosphatase inhibitors in the 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nGently aspirate the ice-cold PBS from the dishes placed on ice in step 3d.\nDiscard remaining PBS by tilting the dishes and collecting the PBS at the bottom side of the plate.\nWait 30 sec-1 min and aspirate out the collected liquid.\nAdd up to 200 μL of 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer to each plate and allow to incubate on ice for 30 sec-1 min.\nNote: Add 200 μL of 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer in >80% confluent cells. If cell confluency is <80%, add less.",
    "Use a cell scraper to collect all cell lysate to one side of the dish.\nPipet the cell lysate into a labeled polypropylene microcentrifuge tube.\nCollect any remaining cell lysate and add this to the tube on ice.\nAfter collecting all samples, sonicate protein lysates for 3 s per each sample (∼65 kHz). Samples remain on ice.\nCritical: Wear hearing protection during sonication.\nPlace the tubes in a microcentrifuge and spin at 21,300 g at 4°C for 7 min.\nTransfer supernatant into a clean microcentrifuge tube and place on ice.\nQuantify protein concentration for each cell lysate sample per manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: Colorimetric protein quantification assays include the Bradford or the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Assays, both available for purchase from many commercial sources. You will need a spectrophotometer that reads in the recommended wavelength.\nNote: Some detergents included in Protein Extraction Buffers may not be compatible with these kits. It is advisable to consult the protein compatibility guide, if detergents other that NP-40 are used, see: https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F23246_23246S_deter_compat_bradford_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F23246_23246S_deter_compat_bradford_UG.pdf]\nIdentify the protein sample that has the lowest concentration.\nCalculate the ratios between the least concentrated sample and each of the remaining samples.\nUse the same ratios to determine the volumes of the concentrated CM for loading in an SDS-PAGE.\nTo load equal sample volumes in an SDS-PAGE, add 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer in those samples. In our case, this volume is 40 μL per sample.\nAdd 10 μL of 5X Protein Loading Buffer for a final volume of 50 μL.\nBoil the samples on a heat block at 95°C for 5 min.\nCritical: Use caution when removing samples from the heat block as built-up pressure may cause lids to suddenly pop.\nSpin samples in a microcentrifuge for 1 min at full speed.",
    "Pause point: Chill samples on wet ice or store at ‒20°C until use.\nWestern blotting of CM from SYF and SYF+c-Src cells\nTiming: 12–24 h\nNote: Western blotting is the qualitative method we use to detect proteins of interest expressed inside (cell extracts) or outside (secreted, CM) cells. Detection of substrate phosphorylation and its interaction with the secreted kinase will then follow (with and without anti-kinase antibody treatment).\nNote: Secretory proteins trafficked through the ER/Golgi pathway are overall abundant and easily detectable in the CM (e.g. TIMPs, MMPs) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Non-conventionally secreted proteins (e.g. c-Src, Hsp90) that predominantly function inside cells generally exist at much lower levels in the extracellular space.\nNote: Non-conventionally secreted proteins are less abundant and hard to detect using standard immunoblotting. One way to increase protein detectability in CM is to collect and analyze the maximum volume of concentrated CM possible in subsequent experiments.\nFor SDS-PAGE run an appropriate volume of concentrated CM prepared as described above in steps 7–8.\nInclude protein ladder and load samples on an SDS-PAGE gradient 4%–20% gel.\nVolume of sample load is determined by the capacity of the gel.\nNote: Run the gel long enough to resolve the smallest size protein for which you are probing.\nUse the semi-dry transfer system to transfer the proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane (see conditions below in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]: SDS Page and Protein Transfer).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3171_9.csv\nAt this point, continue with probing for proteins of interest e.g., c-Src kinase or TIMP2 substrate or other interacting protein candidates (e.g., Hsp90) identified in Backe et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: Probing for a ‘housekeeping’ protein, e.g. GAPDH, known to be a cytosolic protein is also advisable. We provide examples of western blots in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] in Backe et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCell treatment with anti-c-Src antibodies\nTiming: 2–3 days",
    "Timing: 1 ½ days (for step 16)\nTiming: ∼3–6 h (for steps 17–25)\nNote: We use anti-kinase (c-Src) antibodies to block formation of, and/or cause disruption of kinase-substrate complexes. We pre-treat SYF+c-Src cell cultures with anti-c-Src antibodies or the relevant IgG isotype controls for 1 h. This step is followed by addition of an extracellular kinase substrate of interest. In here, we test the human recombinant protein TIMP2-his6.\nNote: c-Src antibodies are commercially available, and details on formulation, specificity and sensitivity are found in the company’s antibody datasheet. Two such antibodies are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]. For the whole list of c-Src antibodies see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] in Backe et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: Because antibodies are added to cells for a short period of time (1–2 h), the presence of sodium azide in the antibody buffer will not affect cell viability. Antibody stocks will also be further diluted to working concentrations (at least 100x).\nCritical: Nevertheless, if presence of sodium azide is unfavorable, perform buffer exchange to remove any salts or unwanted molecules from the antibody or simply ensure that azide- and carrier-free forms of antibodies are purchased.\nNote: If stock antibody concentration is not indicated in the company’s datasheet, it is necessary to call the technical support ahead of time and request that information.\nFor cell seeding and serum starvation follow steps 1 and 2 described earlier.\nDAY 0 - Prepare four 10 cm dishes with cells growing at 70%–90% confluency and culture for ∼16 h.\nDAY 1 - Remove media, wash cells with PBS and add 4 mL of fresh serum-free medium to each dish by gently tilting the plate and adding medium at the edge so to avoid the mechanical detachment of cells.\nIncubate in a humidified 37°C incubator containing 5% CO2 for 24 h.",
    "Cell treatments – stock and working antibodies.\nNote: Treat cells with the anti-c-Src antibody or relevant IgG control at the final concentration of 1 μg/mL.\nDAY 2 – Observe cell cultures under the microscope. Note cell viability and confluency and return cultures back into the incubator.\nDetermine the amounts of antibodies to use for each treatment and prepare antibody stocks.\nCritical: Keep antibodies on wet ice.\nLabel four cell culture dishes as follows:\nPlate 1 (negative control): add 1x PBS equal to the experimental antibody volume.\nPlate 2: add 1x PBS equal to the experimental antibody volume.\nPlate 3: add IgG control so that the final concentration is 1 μg/mL.\nPlate 4: add anti c-Src antibody so that the final concentration is 1 μg/mL.\nGently swirl plates to mix.\nReturn cultures back to the 37°C incubator for 1 h.\nPrepare stock solutions of substrate of interest in sterile microcentrifuge tubes.\nNote: We study human recombinant TIMP2-his6 at working concentration of 50 ng/mL, while the more concentrated stock is prepared in sterile PBS containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nRemove the four dishes from the incubator and add the following:\nPlate 1 (negative control): add PBS containing 0.1% FBS at the volume equal to the TIMP2-his6 volume.\nPlates 2–4: Add recombinant TIMP2-his6 at final concentration of 50 ng/mL.\nSwirl dishes gently and return to the incubator for 1–2 h.\nRemove dishes from the incubator; collect conditioned media (CM).\nConcentrate media 10X as described in steps 4 and 5 (collect cells and determine protein concentration to equalize CM in western blot).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3171-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Coomassie blue dye staining\nSDS-PAGE gel showing total protein loading from concentrated 10X CM with indicated treatments.\nPause point: Store concentrated media at ‒80°C until ready for downstream analyses.",
    "Note: Coomassie blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels or Ponceau staining of the nitrocellulose membrane is required to visualize equal protein loading and transfer (respectively) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nDetection of kinase-substrate interaction\nTiming: 1–2 days\nNote: Verify the detection of extracellular kinase-substrate interaction in the absence of c-Src antibodies. However, pre-treatment of cells with anti-c-Src antibodies will convincingly disrupt protein-protein interactions, as we have previously shown to occur between c-Src and TIMP2 in Backe et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: Treatment of cells with anti-c-Src antibodies also provides valuable information on the impact of extracellular phosphorylation on cellular function (e.g. cell growth, survival, migration, invasion, etc.) (see Backe et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCritical: Keep everything on ice unless otherwise specified.\nNote: We use HisPur Ni-NTA Resin to pull down TIMP2-His6 from concentrated CM prepared in step 25.\nNote: Trim pipette tips to facilitate accurate pipetting of resin slurry.\nCritical: Be extra careful not to disturb the resin during washes.\nAliquot 40 μL of Ni-NTA resin per sample into one microcentrifuge tube per experimental condition. For example, for four pull-downs, combine 160 μL resin in one microcentrifuge tube.\nWash resin with 500 μL of fresh 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 21,300 g for 30 s and repeat steps 27–28 four times.\nNote: Vortex resin in 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer before centrifuging the tubes.\nCritical: The 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer should be freshly made and contain protease and phosphatase inhibitors.\nAfter the final wash, remove the supernatant and add 100 μL of 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer per tested sample. Here, we add 400 μL 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer.\nAliquot 100 μL resin mixture in four microcentrifuge tubes (one tube per sample).",
    "Centrifuge tubes at 21,300 g for 30 s then visually check for equal distribution of the resin among the four tubes.\nGently aspirate out the excess of 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer.\nContinue with the pull-down process (step 34).\nCritical: Be extra careful not to disturb the resin during washes.\nThaw all tubes with concentrated CM on wet- ice.\nAdd 100 μL–200 μL concentrated CM to the HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (from step 32) and place on rotator for 1 h–16 h at 4°C.\nWash four times with fresh 0.1% NP-40 Protein Extraction Buffer containing 50 mM imidazole to reduce non-specific binding of proteins to resin.\nAfter removing final wash, add 5x Protein Loading Buffer to the resin and boil samples in heating block for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 21,300 g for 30 s and transfer the supernatant containing the proteins to a clean microcentrifuge tube.\nRun a test-pull-down on an SDS-PAGE.\nInclude protein ladder and load 5 μL of volume per pull-down sample.\nProbe with anti-his antibody to detect his-tagged protein (TIMP2) in all samples where TIMP2 was added in.\nVerify all bands have equal intensity for TIMP2-his6. If they do not appear equal adjust volumes and run the samples again.\nCo-pull-down for interacting proteins.\nLoad up to 40 μL of pull-down sample prepared in step 38.\nWhen loading 40 μL of samples for the co-pull-down, normalize as in step 39c.\nProceed with western blotting and probe for c-Src or any other proteins of interest.\nNote: If co-pull-down is not detected due to weak protein-protein interactions, consider increasing the volume of concentrated CM for pull-down.\nDetection of extracellular substrate TIMP2 tyrosine phosphorylation\nTiming: 1–2 days\nNote: Below we describe a method that detects tyrosine phosphorylation of extracellular substrate TIMP2-his6 by c-Src-mediated tyrosine kinase in concentrated SYF+c-Src cell CM.",
    "Critical: Keep everything cold or on ice unless specified.\nRefer to steps 25 to 35 to prepare the Ni-NTA resin-CM mixture.\nTransfer the tubes to a microcentrifuge and centrifuge at 94 g for 30 s.\nWash the resin-CM mixture with 500 μL of high salt His6 -tagged protein purification buffer (contains 500 mM NaCl and 50 mM imidazole) to strip the his6-interacting proteins.\nRepeat step 44.\nWash the resin-CM mixture once with 500 μL 0.1% NP40 protein extraction buffer (for this step, add 50 mM imidazole).\nSpin down at 94 g for 30 s.\nRepeat step 46.\nCentrifuge at max speed (21,300 g) for 30 s.\nRemove supernatant then re-suspend the resin in 50–100 μL of 5x protein loading buffer (for this step, add 300 mM imidazole in the 5x protein loading buffer).\nBoil the samples for 5 min.\nSpin the tubes down for 30 s at 21,300 g then transfer the supernatant to new microcentrifuge tubes.\nCritical: Be extra careful not to transfer resin with the supernatant.\nRun 5 μL on SDS-PAGE to test the success of the pull-down.\nProbe for his6 (to detect TIMP2) to confirm equal loading.\nRepeat SDS-PAGE using 30 μL of sample in another SDS-PAGE and probe for total tyrosine phosphorylation of TIMP2-his6 using a pan-pY antibody (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table])."
