    "Transform E. coli strain BL21 star (DE3) cells with pET-SUMO vector containing the C2-domain open reading frame (residues 16-140) of human, chicken, mouse, or zebrafish cPLA2α.Thaw one vial of competent cells on ice per transformation.Add 5-10 ng of the plasmid in a volume of 1-5 μl to the cells and mix by gently tapping.Incubate the vial(s) on ice for 30 min.Heat shock the cells by incubating the vial(s) for exactly 30 s in a 42 °C incubator and then remove the vial(s) from the 42 °C incubator and quickly place on ice.Add 250 μl of pre-warmed SOC medium to the vial(s) and then incubate the vial(s) at 37 °C for 1 h.Plate the transformation reaction onto LB plates containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml) for plasmid selection. Invert the plates and incubate at 37 °C overnight.Notes: Chicken cPLA2α C2-domain sequences Synthesized ORF sequence TATAGCCATGTGTTTACCGTGACCGTGCGCAAAGCCACCAATGTGACCAAAGGCGCCATTGGCGATATGCTGGATACCCCTGATCCTTATGTGGAGCTGTTTATTCCGAGCGCACCGGATTGCCGCAAACGCACCAAGCACTTCAACAACGACGTGAACCCGGTGTGGAACGAGACCTTCGAGTTTATCCTGGACCCGAACCAGGATAACGTGCTGGAAGTGACCCTGATGGACGCCAACTATGTGATGGATGAGACCCTGGGCATGGCCACCTTTCCGATTAGCAGCCTGAAACTGGGCGAGAAGAAAGAAGTTCAGCTGACCTTCAACAACGTGACCGAGATGACCCTGGAACTGAGCCTGGAAGTTTGCAGC Wild-type ORF sequence TACTCACACGTATTCACTGTGACAGTAAGGAAAGCCACAAATGTCACAAAAGGAGCCATTGGCGACATGCTTGACACTCCAGACCCCTATGTAGAGCTGTTCATCCCTTCCGCTCCTGACTGCAGGAAGAGAACTAAACATTTCAATAATGATGTGAATCCTGTGTGGAATGAGACCTTCGAATTCATTCTGGACCCCAACCAGGACTCTTGGTATGGCCAACAATGTTCTTGAGGTTACTTTGATGGATGCCAACTACGTTATGGATGAGCATTTCCTATATCCTCTTTGAAACTGGGAGAGAAGAAGGAGGTCCAGTTAACTTTCAACAATGTTACAGAAATGACTTTGGAGCTGTCTCTTGAAGTGTGCTCT Chicken C2-domain Protein sequence coded by either ORF YSHVFTVTVRKATNVTKGAIGDMLDTPDPYVELFIPSAPDCRKRTKHFNNDVNPVWNETFEFILDPNQDNVLEVTLMDANYVMDETLGMATFPISSLKLGEKKEVQLTFNNVTEMTLELSLEVCS In the synthesized chicken C2-domain ORF, codon usage is optimized for E. coli expression. BamHI and SalI restriction sites are used for open reading frame (ORF) ligation into a modified pET-28-SUMO vector (kanamycin-resistant). Prior to insertion, the human ORF requires mutation to remove a single BamHI internal restriction site 5’-192GGATCC197-3’ without changing the protein sequence. The corresponding GGACCC sites in the chicken sequences are underlined. Collect 5-10 colonies and inoculate 20 ml of autoclaved LB medium (supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin) in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer culture flask. Incubate overnight at 37 °C while shaking at 200 rpm.Use 10 ml of culture from Step 2 to inoculate 1 L of fresh LB medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin and grow in a 2 L Erlenmeyer culture flask at 37 °C until OD600 = 0.6-1.0.",
    "Cool the resulting culture to 20 °C and add IPTG to yield a final concentration of 0.1 mM.After 16-20 h of induction with IPTG at 20 °C and stirring at 220 rpm, collect the cells by centrifuging the culture at 5,000 × g for 10 min.Suspend harvested cells in 30 ml of solution A and freeze at -30 °C until use.Thaw frozen cells and disrupt by French press or sonication. When using probe sonication, apply 6 × 20 s pulses while keeping the sample (30 ml) in an ice bath to prevent heat damage.Transfer the lysate to a centrifuge bottle and centrifuge at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C before loading the resultant supernatant onto a 3 ml column of cOmplete His-Tag Purification Resin pre-equilibrated with Solution A.Wash the resin with more than 10 resin-bed volumes using Solution B and then elute the protein with 10 ml of Solution C.Add Ulp1 protease to remove the N-terminal 6xHis-SUMO tag.Note: An advantage of the Ulp1 protease compared to other sequence-based proteases is the ability of Ulp1 to recognize SUMO tertiary structure and cleave at the C-terminal end of the conserved Gly-Gly sequence in SUMO. This ability eliminates unspecific cleavage associated with other proteases that target a linear protein sequence. SUMO cleavage by Ulp1 does leave two extra amino acids (Gly-Ser) at the N-terminal end of the C2-domain. Dialyze the sample with 2 L of Solution D for more than 3 h at 4 °C.Equilibrate an anion exchange chromatography column (HiTrap Q HP, 1 ml, 0.7 × 2.5 cm) with Solution E using a GE AKTA Prime Liquid Chromatography System.Load the dialyzed solution from Step 11 onto the pre-equilibrated anion exchange column and elute using a 3 to 50% linear gradient of Solution F.",
    "Note: The anion exchange chromatography (Steps 12 and 13) is optional. In Hirano et al. (2019), this chromatography approach was included for crystallography but not for fluorescence resonance energy transfer or surface plasmon resonance experiments since SDS-PAGE revealed similar very high purity in either case. Combine the fractions containing cPLA2α C2-domain and load onto cOmpleteTM His-Tag Purification Resin (3 ml) pre-equilibrated with Solution B, wash the resin with 10 resin-bed volumes of Solution B and then elute the protein with 10 ml of Solution C.Concentrate the flow-through using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter (15 ml sample volume, 10 kDa cutoff) to less than 10 ml and load onto a HiLoad16/60 Superdex 75 pg gel filtration column (L x I.D.; 60 cm × 16 mm, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Solution G for final size exclusion purification of C2-domain monomer using Solution G (Figure 1). SDS-PAGE analysis shows the purity of the resulting monomeric protein (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210203/20210203184123_6904.jpgFigure 1. Chromatogram of gel filtration purification (Step 15 in the Procedure). Y-axis represents absorbance at 280 nm whereas the X-axis represents elution time. The arrow corresponds to the elution peak for monomeric cPLA2α C2-domain (16-140; 14.3 kDa).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3906/bioprotoc-11-03-3906-g002.jpgFigure 2. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified chicken cPLA2α C2-domain (16-140). The protein load for purified C2-domain equals 1-2 μg.Concentrate up to 20 mg/ml and store at -80 °C until use or add glycerol to a final concentration of 50% (v/v) and store at -20 °C. Typical yields of human C2-domain (1.3 mg) and chicken C2-domain (2.2 mg) are readily achievable from 2 L of starting culture medium."
