    "All procedures performed in the studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee, and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n1. Medical History\nStart clinical examination with a detailed patient history.\n\tNOTE: An OLT must always be suspected in case of instability of the ankle with repeated sprains associated with swelling, stiffness, pain, and joint blockage. Moreover, in many cases OLT may be associated with a history of systemic disease, such as inflammatory or vascular disease, neuropathy or neurologic disease, and diabetes. The use of drugs or medical issues that may influence healing must be evaluated and taken into account.\n2. Clinical Examination\nEvaluate the patient in an orthostatic position to highlight ankle or hind-foot deformity. Assess muscle and tendon function and ankle range of movement (ROM). A diffuse tenderness is often present, especially during maximum flexion and extension, and it is not uncommon to encounter a touch-sensitive area at the level of the articular joint.\nPerform an anterior and posterior drawer test to identify a concomitant lateral ankle instability.\nDuring the preoperative consultation, record the following clinical and functional scores: American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle and hind-foot scores15, Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score16, and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)17.\n3. Radiological Assessment\nPerform a bilateral weight bearing radiograph of the foot and ankle. This consists of conventional weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP) mortise, and lateral weight-bearing views of the ankle. Perform AP mortise in neutral position, and with 15 degrees of internal rotation for a better visualization of the talus.\n\tNOTE: Only 50% of OLT can be diagnosed with radiograph; in case of big lesions, an area of detached bone surrounded by radiolucency can be noted18.",
    "Perform a conventional computed tomography-scan (CT-scan) of the ankle. A CT-scan allows a precise location and size of the lesion, identifying also bone fragments in case of detachment. The weak point of the CT is the ability to show the status of the cartilage. A previous study showed a sensitivity and specificity of 0.81 and 0.99, respectively, for detecting OLTs on CT19,20.\nPerform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the ankle. MRI is fundamental in cartilage and subchondral bone assessment. Moreover, the MRI does not involve ionizing radiation, and allows a better visualization of soft-tissue. The literature reports a sensitivity and specificity of 96% in detecting OLTs21,22.\n4. Surgical Technique\nHarvesting and processing of the adipose tissue\nPrepare Klein solution: 1 L of 9 g/L saline, 50 mL of 1% lidocaine, 1 mL of 1:1000 epinephrine, 10 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mL of 10 mg/mL of triamcinolone acetonide.\nCreate two para-umbilical incisions of about 0.5 cm with a scalpel blade. Inject approximately 300 mL of Klein solution into the subcutaneous fat tissue of the abdomen through the incisions using 60 mL syringes with a 18G needle (Figure 1).\nHarvest 40 - 45 mL of ADSCs using a 13G blunt cannula attached to a 20-mL syringe and introduced into the processing kit (Figure 2). Typically, perform the harvesting in the peri-umbilical area.\nInsert 100 - 130 mL of lipoaspirate in the closed system. Push the lipoaspirate into the device through a large filter to obtain a first cluster reduction; at the same time, a corresponding quantity of saline solution exits toward the wasting bag. A key role is played by stainless steel marbles to obtain a temporary emulsion between oil, blood, and saline. Remove oil residues and contaminated blood by a gravity counter-flow of saline solution.",
    "After this washing step (the flowing solution appears clear and the lipoaspirate yellow), stop the saline flux and reverse the device (gray cap up), leading to the second adipose cluster reduction. Obtain the reduction by pushing the floating adipose clusters through the second cutting hexagonal filter, pushing fluid from below with a 10-mL syringe. Collect the final product into a 10-mL syringe connected to the upper opening of the device.\n\t\tNOTE: The processing kit for fat tissue improves standard lipofilling technique: in fact, the system consists of a closed, full-immersion, low-pressure cylindrical system, in order to obtain a fluid and uniform product containing a great number of pericytes. This procedure allows the processing of adipose cells exclusively via mild mechanical forces, and preserving the integrity of the stromal vascular niche. The process is the least traumatic possible, and makes the final product available in a short time (15 - 20 min), without enzymatic treatments or expansion. Undamaged vasculostromal niches help the healing process.\nOnce the ADSCs have been harvested, apply a compression bandage on the abdomen.\nSurgical procedure and Adipose Tissue Injection\nPlace the patient in a supine position under spinal anesthesia with a tourniquet, at a pressure of 250 mmHg, at the level of the thigh to decrease the bleeding and allow a better arthroscopic visualization1.\nMark the anatomical landmarks on the skin with a dermographic pen. Landmarks are essential to avoid iatrogenic injuries.\n\t\tMark the following (Figure 3):\n\t\tboth malleoli (lateral (LM) and medial (MM))\n\t\tthe anterior joint line (JL), identified with dorsi- and plantar-flexion of the ankle joint\n\t\tthe tibialis anterior tendon (TAT), and Achilles tendon\n\t\tthe great saphenous vein, which runs just ahead of the medial malleolus\n\t\tthe superficial peroneal nerve (SPN)",
    "First, perform the anteromedial portal just medial to the tibialis anterior tendon, coinciding with a soft spot. This portal represents the approach portal. In most cases, a depression with the ankle in dorsiflexion is visible and palpable.\n\t\t\nCut only the skin with a blade, and then perforate the capsule by blunt dissection. Take care to avoid the saphenous nerve and the great saphenous vein. The saphenous vein is located 9 mm laterally to the portal, while the nerve is about 7.4 mm lateral to the portal. This constitutes one of two primary viewing portals.\nCheck the joint line, place the anterolateral portal, medial to the lateral malleolus, and lateral to the extensor digitorum tendon.\n\t\tNOTE: When performing the anterolateral portal, prevent any injuries to the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve (the lateral branch of the superficial peroneal nerve); for this reason, after cutting, the skin must be followed by blunt dissection.\nInspect the articular cartilage to assess size and position. Evaluate the condition and the quality of the cartilage with the palpator. Osteochondral lesions of the talus are usually located either posteromedially or anterolaterally.\n\t\t\nPerform arthroscopic treatment using wide-angle 2.7-mm arthroscopes with a 30Â° viewing angle, though some surgeons will use a larger 4 mm arthroscope, and keep the instrument in the anterior recess of the joint. Non-invasive joint distraction techniques and hyper plantar flexion can be used to access most of the talar dome.",
    "In case of a posterior lesion, percutaneously place a Hintermann spreader to distract the joint and allow exposure of the lesion. The Hintermann spreader has an opening lever arm applied on two K-wires previously positioned in the tibia and talar bone medially or laterally, according to the lesion side. In the case of a lateral lesion, take care to insert the proximal K-wire in the tibial bone, avoiding the fibula, to achieve better distraction of the joint.\nPrepare the lesion with a curette, removing the damaged and unstable cartilage, the calcified layer and necrotic and sclerotic bone in order to create a regular-shaped contained lesion with shouldered borders. For this step, use a standard arthroscopic curette (Figure 4).\nStimulate bone marrow stem cells from subchondral bone performing microperforations roundly from the outside to the inside of the lesion.\n\t\t\nCarry out perforations with intervals of about 3 mm between them. Induce microfractures using a Chondral Pick on the healthy subchondral bone underneath the defect (Figure 5).\n\t\t\tNOTE: A hemorrhage results in the formation of a fibrin clot. Blood clotting products, via inflammatory cascade activation, release vasoactive mediators, growth factors, and cytokines. These factors have the power to stimulate vascular invasion and migration of mesenchymal stem cells into the chondral portion of the lesion. These pluripotent cells are stimulated to differentiate into fibroblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, and play an important role in the stimulation of repair of the lesion. Paracrine growth factors in the articular environment promote the formation of extracellular matrix and the production of fibrocartilage. At the same time, cells of the bone part of the lesion produce an immature bone tissue that is progressively replaced by a mature bone.",
    "Remove the intra-articular water using the shaver in aspiration and the remaining liquid using a cotton sponge until the joint is completely dry.\nAdipose-derived stem cell injection\nInject 5 - 7 mL of adipose-derived stem cells, previously prepared in Step 4.1.3, into the ankle joint using one of the two portals (anteromedial or anterolateral).\nRelease the tourniquet.\n5. Postoperative Care\nAvoid ankle movements for 15 days, with the operated limb in full discharge.\n15 days after surgery, allow active and passive movements of the ankle, until full recovery and range of motion is reached.\nAllow charge 30 days after surgery.\n6. Clinical and Radiographic Follow-Up\nEvaluate patients clinically and radiologically at six and twelve months and, thereafter, annually. The follow-up protocol consists of AOFAS ankle and hind-foot scores, VAS pain score, and SF-12 at each end-point15,16,17. Radiographic examination includes an MRI and CT-scan of the operated ankle.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
