    "1. Synthesizing Functionalizable poly(1,3-glycerol carbonate-co-caprolactone)29 and poly(1,3-glycerol carbonate-co-lactide)27,28.\nMonomer synthesis.\n\t\nDissolve cis-2-Phenyl-1,3-dioxan-5-ol (50 g, 0.28 mol, 1 eq.) in 500 ml dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and stir on ice under nitrogen. Add potassium hydroxide (33.5 g, 0.84 mol, 3 eq.), finely crushed with a mortar and pestle. Place flask in ice bath.\nAdd 49.6 ml benzyl bromide (71.32 g, 0.42 mol, 1.5 eq.) drop-wise with stirring on ice. Allow the reaction to warm to room temperature with stirring for 24 hr, under nitrogen.\nAdd 150 ml distilled water to dissolve potassium hydroxide and remove the THF by rotary evaporation.\nExtract the remaining material with 200 ml dichloromethane (DCM) in a 1-L separatory funnel. Repeat the extraction twice.\nDry the organic phase on sodium sulfate.\nCrystallize the product by adding 600 ml absolute ethanol to the solution, mixing well, and storing overnight at -20 °C. The product can be stored at -20 °C for several days before performing subsequent steps.\nIsolate product by vacuum-filtration through a Büchner funnel and dry on high-vacuum. The product can be stored for several days before performing subsequent steps. A typical yield for this step is ~80%.\nIn a 1-L round-bottom flask, suspend the product obtained in step 1.1.7. in methanol (300 ml). Add 150 ml of 2 N hydrochloric acid. Reflux at 80 °C for 2 hr.\nEvaporate solvent and place under high-vacuum for 24 hr. The yield for this step is typically >98%.\nDissolve product of 1.1.9 in THF (650 ml) and transfer to a 2-L round-bottom flask. Place flask on ice bath and stir under nitrogen. Add 22.4 ml ethyl chloroformate (25.6 g, 0.29 mol, 2 eq.) to flask under nitrogen.",
    "Add 32.8 ml triethylamine (0.29 mol, 2 eq.) to an addition funnel. Mix with an equal volume of THF. Place addition funnel on round-bottom flask and keep under nitrogen.\nWith vigorous stirring, carefully dispense triethyamine/THF mixture drop-wise to the round-bottom flask on ice. CAUTION: this is an exothermic reaction. To prevent rapid temperature increase, add the triethylamine/THF solution no faster than 1 drop per second. After adding the full volume, stir the reaction for 4 hr, warming up to room temperature, or for 24 hr.\nFilter out the triethylamine hydrochloride salt using a Büchner funnel. Evaporate the solvent on a rotary evaporator.\nAdd dichloromethane (200 ml) to the flask and heat gently until the residue is dissolved. Add 120 ml of diethyl ether while swirling. Store at -20 °C overnight to crystallize the product.\nFilter monomer crystals and re-crystallize before polymerizing. The monomer product can be stored sealed at room temperature for 2 weeks or at -20 °C indefinitely. Confirm product by 1H NMR, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. A typical yield for this final step in the monomer synthesis is between 40-60%.\nCopolymerization of D,L-lactide/ε-caprolactone with 5-benzyloxy-1,3-dioxan-2-one.\n\t\nHeat silicone oil bath to 140 °C.\nMeasure 2.1 g of 5-benzyloxy-1,3-dioxan-2-one (prepared in 1.1) and add it to a dry 100-ml round-bottom flask. If copolymerizing D,L-lactide, measure out 5.7 g and add to the flask now. Add a magnetic stir bar and seal the flask with a rubber stopper.\n\t\t\nAlso measure 240 mg (an excess) of tin(II) ethylhexanoate in a small pear-shaped flask. This polymerization will result in a 20 mol% glycerol carbonate monomer composition. Adjust the masses of monomers to achieve different monomer compositions.",
    "Flush both flasks with nitrogen on a Schlenk manifold for 5 min and add 4.24 ml ε-caprolactone under nitrogen. Evacuate flasks’ atmosphere by applying high-vacuum (300 mTorr) for 15 min to remove trace water.\nRecharge the flasks’ atmosphere with nitrogen; repeat this cycle twice more.\nMix 500 µl dry toluene with the tin catalyst under nitrogen.\nPlace the monomer flask in the 140 °C oil bath and add catalyst once all solids have melted. The total volume of catalyst mixture delivered should be ~100 µl. Keep at 140 °C for no more than 24 hr, then cool the molten polymer to room temperature. Perform the subsequent steps immediately or at least 24 hr later.\nDissolve the polymer in dichloromethane (50 ml) and precipitate into cold methanol (200 ml). Decant supernatant and dry under high-vacuum. The subsequent steps can be performed immediately or at any point. Store polymers in the freezer until further use. The typical polymerization yield/conversion is between 80-95%.\nPerform 1H NMR analysis to determine the co-monomer molar ratios. Dissolve polymer in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) and integrate the benzylic proton shift of the carbonate monomer at 4.58-4.68 ppm; compare this peak area with that of the methylene peak at 2.3 ppm (PCL) and methyne peak at 5.2 ppm (PLGA).\nPolymer modification: deprotection and grafting.\n\t\nDissolve polymer (~7 g) in 120 ml tetrahydrofuran (THF) in a high-pressure hydrogenation vessel. Weigh and add palladium-carbon catalyst (~2 g).\nAdd hydrogen to the vessel using a hydrogenation apparatus. Hydrogenate at 50 psi for 4 hr. CAUTION: hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. Seek assistance from persons familiar with this procedure and always inspect the supply lines for possible leaks before performing this experiment.",
    "Filter out palladium-carbon catalyst using a packed bed of diatomaceous earth. Concentrate the polymer to ~50 ml under rotary evaporation and precipitate into cold methanol. CAUTION: Dry palladium particulates can spontaneously ignite. Keep a wet towel nearby in the event of a flare-up for smothering the flames. Add water to the palladium/carbon filter cake to keep it clumped and to prevent its ignition. Seek assistance from persons familiar with this procedure.\nDecant the supernatant and dry under high-vacuum. Confirm total conversion to free hydroxyl by noting the peak disappearance at 4.65 ppm (1H NMR in CDCl3). These polymers can be used immediately or saved for later use. Yields for this step are >90%.\nDissolve the polymer and stearic acid (1.5 eq.) in 500 ml dry dichloromethane (DCM). Add N,N’-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 2.0 eq.) and 3 flakes of 4-dimethylaminopyridine. Stir under nitrogen at room temperature for 24 hr.\nRemove insoluble N,N’-dicyclohexylcarbourea through a series of repeated filtrations and concentrations. At the end, concentrate the solution to 50 ml.\nPrecipitate polymer into cold methanol (~175 ml) and decant the supernatant. Dry the polymer under high-vacuum overnight. Subsequent use of these polymers can be performed at any time, but keep polymers in the freezer for long-term storage. The yield for this final modification step is generally between 85-90%.\n2. Characterizing the Synthesized Copolymers\nWeigh out ~10 mg polymer (record the actual mass) and add to aluminum sample pan, then hermetically seal it. Load sample pan and an unloaded (reference) pan into the differential scanning calorimeter.\nProgram a temperature ramp and cooling (“heat/cool/heat”) cycle: 1) heat from 20 °C to 225 °C at 10 °C/min, 2) cool to -75 °C at 5 °C/min, 3) heat to 225 °C at 10 °C/min.",
    "Determine melting point (Tm), crystallization (Tc) and glass transition temperatures (Tg), and heat of fusion (ΔHf) from the thermal traces (if applicable).\nDissolve each synthesized copolymer in THF (1 mg/ml) and filter through a 0.02-µm PTFE filter. Inject the solution into a gel permeation chromatography system and compare retention time versus a range of polystyrene standards.\n3. Preparing Polymer Solutions for Electrospinning/electrospraying27,31\nDissolve polymer(s) at 10-40 wt% in suitable solvent, such as chloroform/methanol (5:1) for PCL or tetrahydrofuran/N,N-dimethylformamide (7:3) for PLGA, overnight. The mass of polymer required for this step will depend on the dimensions of the desired mesh.\n\tNote: For example, to produce a 10 cm x 10 cm mesh of approximately 300-micron thickness, 1 gram will typically be required. It is worth noting that material losses may occur in subsequent steps of this protocol, such as during solution transfer to the syringe (especially for viscous solutions), and from dead volumes present in the optional connector tubing and the needle housing itself, which will reduce the yield of the electrospinning process. These reductions in yield may result in up to 20% loss of material, and it is recommended to scale up 1.5-fold to anticipate these losses, and also those losses associated with optimizing the electrospinning parameters when attempting this procedure for the first time.\n\t\nControl fiber size by varying the total polymer concentration, with larger fibers expected from more concentrated solutions. For a modest enhancement of hydrophobicity, use 10% (by total polymer mass) superhydrophobic dopant. For extremely hydrophobic/superhydrophobic materials, use 30-50% dopant and/or reduce the total polymer concentration (i.e., reduce fiber size). Subsequent work with these solutions may be performed the next day or within one week thereafter.",
    "For electrospraying, prepare solutions at lower concentrations (i.e., 2-10%) in a suitable solvent such as chloroform. Like electrospinning, modulate particle size by varying the polymer concentration.\nVortex polymer solution to thoroughly mix. Allow large air bubbles to subside (5 min).\nLoad solution into a glass syringe. Depending on solution viscosity, it may be easiest to remove the plunger and pour the solution directly into the syringe. A piece of inert, flexible tubing may aid maneuverability within the electrospinning setup. Invert the syringe to displace air through the hose/needle assembly.\n4. Electrospinning/electrospraying Polymer Solutions\nLoad syringe onto syringe pump, set total volume (e.g., 4.5 ml) and the rate (e.g., 5 ml/hr) at which to dispense this solution.\nCover the collector plate with aluminum foil to ease subsequent removal and transport. Secure the foil with masking tape along the outer edges.\nAttach the high voltage DC (HVDC) supply wire to needle tip. The distance of this needle tip to the collector is an important variable to consider because it 1) affects the electric field at a given voltage, and 2) impacts the evaporation of solvent and consequent drying of fibers during their collection.\n\t\nAs a first attempt, use a tip-to-collector distance of 15 cm. CAUTION: High voltages and flammable solvents are involved in electrospinning/electrospraying. Provide adequate ventilation to outside exhaust, and never touch the syringe/needle or open the enclosure until absolutely certain the HVDC supply is off.\nIf electrospinning/electrospraying a large area of coverage, turn on rotating and translating collector drum. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.\nStart the syringe pump.",
    "Turn on and adjust the high voltage source to achieve an acceptable Taylor Cone. If the solution at the needle tip is sagging, increase the voltage. If multiple jets are forming, reduce the voltage. In addition to these adjustments, it may be necessary to adjust the tip-to-collector distance if the fibers/particles appear wet or if adjusting the voltage does not adequately solve a dragging droplet at the needle tip.\n\tNote: For detailed troubleshooting, see the comprehensive electrospinning optimization process by Leach and co-workers47. Electrospraying will generally involve higher voltages and lower solution concentrations than electrospinning.\nTurn off the high voltage source and then the syringe pump and motorized drum (if applicable). Allow the electrospinning enclosure to continue ventilating for 30 min.\nRemove meshes/coatings from collector. Allow trace solvents to evaporate in a hood overnight. Materials can be stored at room temperature for at least two weeks (PLGA) or two months (PCL). Steps 4.5-4.8 may be performed in any order.\n5. Characterizing Fiber and Particle Size by Light and Scanning Electron Microscopy\nLight microscopy\n\t\nIf producing an electrospun mesh, cut and mount thin portions of it on a glass slide.\nObserve fiber diameter, node characteristics (blobs or discrete), and fiber shape (i.e., beaded, flat, straight/wavy). Ideal electrospun mesh fibers are uniform, straight or wavy, and bead-free.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM)\n\t\nCut and mount meshes or coated surfaces on aluminum SEM stubs using conductive copper tape. Electrospun fibers and electrosprayed coatings can also be observed by SEM by directly depositing fibers/particles onto the tape in advance.\nCoat the meshes/coatings with a thin (~4 nm) layer of Au/Pd through sputter coating.",
    "Load stubs into SEM chamber and observe at 1-2 keV. A 250X magnification provides a general topographical assessment of the material, while higher magnifications reveal additional fiber and particle features such as hierarchal patterns for extremely superhydrophobic fibers and interconnectivity for particle coatings.\n6. Determining Non-wetting Properties\nAdvancing and receding water contact angle measurements using the volume variation method\n\t\nCut thin (0.5 cm x 5 cm) strips of mesh or coated material (if possible) and place on the stage of a contact angle goniometer.\nCapture the water drop profile while dispensing it (from a 24 AWG syringe needle) on the material surface.\n\t\t\nTo do this, start with an approximate 5-µl drop, and make contact with the material surface. Continue to slowly add volume (20-25 µl) and capture the droplet image, which represents the advancing water contact angle. The needle tip should be small compared to the droplet, and the capillary length should be greater than the droplet to minimize distortion of droplet shape.\nWithdraw this same drop while simultaneously capturing its drop profile. Repeat on discrete surface locations of several samples to report an average value—typically, 10 measurements of both advancing and receding contact angles are sufficient to characterize these materials.\nDetermine critical surface tension of materials by modifying probing liquids.\n\t\nPrepare solutions varying in ethanol, propylene glycol, or ethylene glycol content, as these mixtures have known surface tensions99-101.",
    "Alternatively, use solvents with varying surface tensions—for example, water (72 mN/m), glycerol (64 mN/m), dimethyl sulfoxide (44 mN/m), benzyl alcohol (39 mN/m), 1,4-dioxane (33 mN/m), 1-octanol (28 mN/m), and acetone (25 mN/m). It is important to use solvents that will not dissolve the polymers, as these will confound results. Additionally, it is important to note that, in addition to surface tension, these liquids have different viscosities, which may impact contact angle measurements and is a limitation of this technique.\nMeasure the contact angle of these solutions probed on the material surface. Plot contact angle as a function of surface tension.\n7. Detecting Bulk Wetting of Meshes31\nObserve water infiltration into 3D meshes using micro-computed tomography (µCT).\n\t\nPrepare an 80 mg/ml solution of Ioxaglate (an iodinated contrast agent) in water.\nSubmerge meshes in these solutions and incubate at 37 °C; periodically measure contrast agent (water) infiltration by µCT (18 µm3 voxel resolution) using a 70 kVP tube voltage, 114 µA current, and a 300 msec integration time.\nUsing image processing software, measure pixel intensity throughout the thickness of the mesh, where bright pixels represent water infiltration. Select a pixel threshold value (~1500) for which higher intensity represents water infiltration.\n8. Testing the Mechanical Properties of Meshes\nCut meshes to 1 cm x 7 cm and place between the grips of a tensile testing apparatus. Measure the exact width, length, and thickness.\nPerform a ramp test of extension on three samples. Plot a stress-strain curve using these data to determine the elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation-at-break.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
