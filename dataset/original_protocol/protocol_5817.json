    "Preparation of rTRL (see Figure 1 for a schematic overview)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180702/20180702001504_9532.jpgFigure 1. Schematic depiction of TRL PreparationNote: All steps are performed at room temperature in a fume hood and in an isotope laboratory. Add the lipid solution (see Recipes section below) to a glass vial (2 mg lipids per mouse) and make sure to prepare at least for 3 more mice than are required. Since we gavage 200 µl rTRL per mouse, minimum volume/vial would be for 4 mice (total final volume of 800 µl) and maximum volume/vial would be for 20 mice (total final volume of 4 ml).Remove solvents from lipid solution under an ambient flow of nitrogen (1.5 L/min) until you have a lipid layer at the bottom of the glass vial (Figure 2A).Add per mouse 50 µl of chloroform and 18.5 KBq of [4-14C]-Cholesterol to the glass vial.Remove the chloroform again by evaporating the lipid solution under a flow of nitrogen (1.5 L/min) until you again have a lipid layer at the bottom of the glass vial (Figure 1A).To form rTRL, add per mouse 200 µl of 0.9% NaCl solution to the lipid layer and seal vial with parafilm to avoid spilling during sonification (Figure 2B).Carefully place the vial below the sonifier tip. Make sure the tip does not touch the bottom (Figure 1B). Sonify three times for 3 min and 20 sec (20,000 Hz, 100 W) with a vigorous vortex step after the first sonification until the liquid has a milky appearance (Figure 2C).rTLR particles have to be prepared freshly and may not be stored overnight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180704/20180704010233_4062.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of the rTRL. A.",
    "Lipid solution was added to a glass vial and solvents were evaporated under a flow of nitrogen to leave an oily lipid layer on the bottom of the glass vial before and after addition of radioactivity. B and C. 0.9% NaCl solution was added to the lipid layer (B) and was sonified to form a milk-like rTRL emulsion (C).Cholesterol uptake assayNote: All steps are performed at room temperature in an isotope laboratory. Cholesterol uptake experiment is performed in mice previously housed at thermoneutrality (30 °C) or cold (6 °C) for 7 days in a humidity-controlled (55%) climate chamber.In the morning of the experiment fast the mice for 4 h. For this purpose, remove the food from the cages and refresh the bedding in the morning.After the 4 h fasting period, bring mice to the isotope laboratory (room temperature).For the gavage, fill rTRL solution into 1 ml syringes (equipped with an animal feeding needle as tip). Restrict mice by hand-grabbing and carefully place the feeding needle into their mouth and esophagus to empty 200 µl of rTRL solution (10 mg lipid/ml and 92.5 kBq/ml) directly into their stomach. Let the mice ingest for a further 4 h (water is provided at all times).For blood collection, prepare 1 ml syringes equipped with hypodermic needles and fill them with 5 µl EDTA.After four hours, anesthetize mice deeply by i.p. injection of 300 µl anesthesia (see Recipes section below).When mice are deeply anesthetized, open peritoneum, take 200 µl blood from the heart and then add the blood to an Eppendorf tube.Take organs of interest, note total weights of wet organs and store organ pieces (< 180 mg) each in a separate Eppendorf tube at 4 °C until further processing.",
    "Liquid-Scintillation counting (see Figure 3 for a schematic overview)Note: All steps are performed at room temperature in an isotope laboratory. Prepare blood plasma by centrifugation of blood at 4 °C, 10,000 x g for 10 min. Take supernatant as plasma and store plasma at 4 °C until further processing.Dissolve organ pieces in 2 ml or 15 ml tubes with Solvable (100 µl per 10 mg organ) by shaking overnight at 60 °C. For scintillation counting, make sure to homogenize the solved organ thoroughly.Take 5 µl or 10 µl of rTLR solution or 10 µl of plasma and 400 μl of the organ solution and add 4 ml of Aquasafe 500 Plus in Pico Prias vials. Mix by shaking and let sit for an hour before liquid-scintillation counting (14C cpm mode).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180702/20180702001936_5343.jpgFigure 3.
