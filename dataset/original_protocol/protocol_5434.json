    "Cell culture and transfectionPerform all cell culture based work in a class II biological safety cabinet/tissue culture hood and disinfect the work surface and materials (e.g., pipettes) with 70% (v/v) ethanol.Grow mammalian cells of choice (here, human skin fibroblasts) in complete growth medium (see Recipes) (10 cm Ø cell culture dishes or cell culture flasks) in a humidified CO2 incubator (95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C).For maintenance of cells, refresh the cell culture medium every 2-3 days and split the cells before they reach 100% confluency using standard cell culture procedures (see Note 3).One or two days prior to transfection split the cells so that they reach 70-80% confluency at the day of transfection (10 cm Ø cell culture dishes or cell culture flasks).Prior to transfection prepare 3.5 cm glass bottom dishes with complete growth medium (without antibiotics), and pre-incubate in the CO2 incubator at 37 °C.In addition, place the Neon® Microporation device in the biological safety cabinet. Fill a Neon tube with 3 ml of electrolyte buffer E and insert the tube into the pipette station. Set the transfection parameters (here, 1,700 V, 20 msec pulse width, 1 pulse) on the device (see Notes 4 and 5).For transfection, wash the cells (from 10 cm Ø cell culture dishes or cell culture flasks) once with 1x PBS (see Recipes) and incubate for 2-5 min with 1 ml of TrypLE Express at 37 °C.Resuspend detached cells in 9 ml of complete growth medium (without antibiotics), and determine the cell number using a TC20TM Automated Cell Counter (see Note 6).For each transfection reaction use 1-2 x 105 cells (number of cells used with a 10 µl microporation tip) (see Note 7).",
    "Transfer the total number of cells for all transfections to a 15 ml tube and centrifuge for 3 min at RT in a table top centrifuge (500 x g).Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of 1x PBS and transfer cells to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge cells in a microcentrifuge for 3 min at 500 x g and resuspend the pellet in buffer R. The amount of buffer R will depend on the number of transfections and the microporation tip used (e.g., 6 transfections with a 10 µl microporation tip–6 x 10 µl = 60 µl).For each transfection, pre-mix 1-2 µg of plasmid DNA (here, EGFP-SKL) and 50-100 nM of siRNA (optional) in a microcentrifuge tube and add 10 µl of cells resuspended in buffer R. To facilitate pipetting, mix enough reagents for at least 2 transfections in each microcentrifuge tube (see Note 8).Mount a 10 µl Neon tip onto the Neon pipette.Immerse the tip into the cell-DNA-siRNA mixture and slowly aspirate 10 µl of the sample. Avoid generating air bubbles in the tip.Insert the pipette into the E buffer–containing tube in the pipette station, and press start on the touch screen.After delivery of the electric pulse, quickly remove the pipette from the pipette station and immediately transfer the cells from the tip to the 3.5 cm dishes containing the pre-warmed growth medium (without antibiotics) (see Note 9).Gently move the dish horizontal and vertical to evenly distribute the cells (see Note 10).Incubate the cells in a humidified CO2 incubator (95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C) for 48-72 h to allow efficient silencing (see Note 11).Discard the Neon tip in an appropriate biological hazardous waste container and repeat steps A12 to A18 for the remaining cell-DNA-siRNA mixtures (e.g., control siRNA and other plasmids of interest) (see Note 12).",
    "Live-cell imagingPrior to image acquisition set up a controlled-temperature and CO2 chamber at the microscope stage, as well as an objective warmer. In the absence of a CO2 regulator change cells to a CO2–independent medium (e.g., HEPES buffered).Set up a glass bottom dish in the controlled-temperature and CO2 chamber, switch on the mercury lamp and scan the sample for transfected cells (i.e., green GFP signal). Image collection is performed using VisiView software. For imaging, 250 stacks of 9 planes (0.5 µm thickness, 100 msec exposure) were taken from each cell in a continuous stream. All conditions and laser intensities were kept between experiments.Collected images are converted into a Maximum intensity projection file using VisiView. This option compresses the images from each stack into a single one and binds them in a continuous time frame (Videos 1 and 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Peroxisome movement in control fibroblasts. Video 1 shows movement of peroxisomes in human skin fibroblasts (control) transfected with the peroxisome marker EGFP-SKL (fluorescent reporter with a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal). Note the spherical, punctate labelling of peroxisomes and some long-range, directed movements, which are likely microtubule-dependent. Bar = 20 µm. Video 1 (2 min observation, 10 x original speed) is taken from Costello et al. (2017b).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Peroxisome movement in fibroblasts after loss of ACBD5. Video 2 shows increased movement of peroxisomes in human skin fibroblasts silenced for ACBD5. Peroxisomes were labelled as described (Video 1). Note that loss of ACBD5, which tethers peroxisomes to the ER, results in increased peroxisomal movement. Not all of the movements may depend on microtubules. Bar = 20 µm. Video 2 (2 min observation, 10 x original speed) is taken from Costello et al. (2017b).Peroxisome motility measurementsThe following workflow is implemented as a Python module, which uses Numpy, Scipy, and Scikit-Image libraries.",
    "Each frame is filtered using Laplace of Gaussian scale-space filtering (Lindeberg, 1998).The threshold for each filtered image is determined using Median Absolute Deviation as a robust estimator of foreground locations (Hampel, 1974).Peroxisome positions are calculated as maxima in the filtered image above threshold.Positions between frames are tracked using a global optimization subroutine using a modified version of the Jonker-Volgenant algorithm (Jonker and Volgenant, 1987). Tracking results are manually verified for accuracy.Peroxisome trajectories are displayed as trajectory and density plots, and converted into speed distributions which are subsequently plotted as cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) (Figure 1).Pseudocode for the tracking is:# Detection allpositions = [] for t in range(len(frames)):         filtered = scale_space_filter(frames[t])         threshold = median(filtered) + 3*median_absolute_deviation(filtered)         positions = peak_locations(filtered, mask=filtered>threshold)         allpositions.append(positions) # Tracking allidentities = [ range(len(allpositions[0])) ] max_identity = max(allidentites[0]) for t in range(1, len(allpositions)+1):         cost = distance_matrix(allpositions[t-1], allpositions[t])         identities, final_cost = lapjv(cost)         identities[final_cost > maximum_distance] = -1         max_identity = max(allidentites[-1], max_identity)         num_new = count(identities == -1)         identities[identities == -1] = range(max_identity+1, max_identity+num_new+1)         allidentities.append(identities) # Create trajectories for t in range(len(allidentities)):         for i in range(len(allidentities[t])): trajectories[allidentities[t][i]].append(allpositions[t][i])"
