    "Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved and are in accordance with animal care guidelines provided by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and the University of Ottawa animal care committees.\n1. Preparation\nPrepare the dissection surface by taping a 9 cm Petri dish lid with autoclave tape across its interior surface. Position it under a stereo-microscope.\nPlace 3 - 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae in a Petri dish and anesthetize in ˜1.5 mM Tricaine in 1x E3 embryo media (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4, pH 7.2).\nCut off the end of a P1000 pipette tip with a pair of scissors or a razor blade to a diameter of 2 mm to accommodate a 3 dpf larva with minimal stress.\n2. Fin Clipping of Zebrafish Larvae\nPick up an anesthetized larva using the modified P1000 micropipette and place the zebrafish larva onto the positioned autoclave tape on the Petri dish lid.\nRemove excess Tricaine solution surrounding the larva using a micropipette. The area should be as dry as possible to successfully section and pick up the fin but still wet to ensure survival.\nUsing a micro scalpel, section the caudal fin under a stereo-microscope as indicated in Figure 1, as described in Wilkinson et al16. During the incision, apply a steady downward pressure within the pigment gap site of the caudal fin, distal to the limit of the blood circulation (Figure 1A). Apply gentle pressure to avoid damaging the notochord.\nVisualize the sectioned fin under the microscope and position the piece on top of the tip of the microscalpel blade (Figure 2A). Place the microscalpel containing the fin onto the surface of a small piece of filter paper.",
    "NOTE: Due to the presence of melanocytes in the transected tissue, this step allows visualization of the fin as a small black spot (Figure 2B).\nUsing scissors and tweezers (Figure 2C), transfer the filter paper containing the fin to a 96-well PCR plate, containing 25 μL of 50 mM NaOH solution per well (Figure 2D).\nPrepare a flat-bottom 96-well plate, numbering the well according to the label of the PCR plate. Using the modified P1000 pipette filled with 200 µL of fresh 1x E3 embryo media, carefully collect the zebrafish larva using gentle pressure. Dispense the larva in the 96-well tissue culture plate, in the same well number as the PCR plate (Figure 2E).\nMake sure that the filter paper is well submerged in the solution (Figure 2F). Clean the blade of the microscapel and tweezers between each cut to prevent cross-contamination by dipping it into 70% EtOH solution. Wipe the blade with clean paper tissue/wipe.\nRepeat steps 2.1 - 2.7 until all embryos have been clipped.\nStore the larvae in the 96-well plate at 28 °C until the genotypes have been identified.\n\tNOTE: The embryo media does not need to be changed, since the protocol can be easily completed in less than 2 days. If more time is needed, a media change is recommended.\n3. Genomic DNA Extraction\nSeal the 96-well PCR plate and centrifuge the samples at 1,000 x g for 1 min to make sure all the filter papers are submerged within the NaOH solution.\nFor tissue lysis, heat the samples in a thermocycler at 95 °C for 5 min followed by cooling to 4 °C for 10 min.\nAdd 6 μL of 500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 to each sample. Vortex.\nBriefly centrifuge the plate at 1,500 x g, for 5 min at room temperature.",
    "Use 1.5 μL of the DNA supernatant per PCR reaction.\nPrepare a PCR to genotype the larvae, as shown in Table 1-2.\n\tNOTE: This protocol was tested for two applications: multiplex PCR reactions revealing the genotype using agarose gels9, and heteroduplex melting assay (HMA) revealing the genotypes using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)17.\n4. Alternative Genomic Extraction Using a Chelating Resin\nComplete step 2.5 by adding filter paper with the clipped fin to a 96-well PCR plate, containing 30 μL of 5% chelating resin (styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer containing paired iminodiacetate ions).\n\tNOTE: This type of resin is commonly used for tissue lysis and preparation of PCR-ready DNA in a fast and efficient manner18.\nFollow steps 2.6 - 2.8 as indicated.\nSeal the 96-well PCR plate and briefly centrifuge the samples to make sure all filter paper is submerged within the chelating resin.\nFor tissue lysis, heat the samples in a thermocycler at 95 °C for 15 min followed by cooling to 4 °C for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: This step allows lysis and subsequent binding of the polar resin beads to cellular components while DNA and RNA remain in solution.\nBriefly centrifuge the samples to pellet the resin beads and obtain the DNA in the suspension.\nFollow steps 3.5 - 3.6 to complete genotyping procedure.\n5. Application 1: Multiplex PCR Followed by Agarose Gel Analysis\nFollowing Table 1, set up a multiplex PCR reaction to enable the discrimination between homozygous mutants, heterozygotes, and WT larvae. Use a 96-well thermal cycler to perform the PCR reactions using the cycling conditions described in Table 3.\n\tNOTE: The PCR reactions can also be performed in any other conventional PCR thermal cycler. This example describes the PCR strategy used by Pena, et al.9 to identify aldh7a1 WT and 5-bp insertion mutant alleles in the same multiplex reaction.",
    "Prepare a 1% agarose gel in sodium borate buffer, stained with 1x GelRed.\n\tNOTE: 20x sodium borate buffer stock is made of 40 mL of 10 M NaOH, 1800 mL of ddH2O, pH adjusted to 8.5 with 76 g of boric acid and then completed to 2 L final volume using ddH2O.\nRun the gel in 1x sodium borate buffer for 15 min at 250 V. To facilitate the process, if possible, use a gel system that is compatible with multichannel pipets to enable higher throughput capabilities by reducing the time to load samples.\nImage the gel under ultraviolet (UV) light to allow discrimination of the different genotypes.\n6. Application 2: Heteroduplex Melting Assay\nPrepare PAGE 12% gels using the 1.5 mm spacer plate and the 15-samples combs. Prepare two PAGE gels using 12.21 mL of ddH2O, 2.52 mL of 10x Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE), 10 mL of 30% acrylamide, 250 μL of 10% ammonium persulfate (APS) and 20 μL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED). Use 1x TBE buffer (0.089 M Tris-HCl, 0.089 M boric acid and 0.002 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) as running buffer.\nHeat the PCR products at 94 °C for 5 min.\nCool the tubes on ice or in the thermocycler for 10 min at 4 °C.\nLoad 10 μL per PCR sample and 8 μL of molecular weight marker.\nRun the PAGE at 150 V in 1x TBE using a vertical electrophoresis system for 1 h or until the molecular weight marker almost reaches the foot line of the glass plate.\nImage the gel under UV light to allow discrimination of the different genotypes.\nSubscription Required.
