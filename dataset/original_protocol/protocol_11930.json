    "All methods described here have been approved by the University of Alberta Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Protocol 1: Visualization of SOS using stereomicroscopy and differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging\nEmbryo collection\n\t\nIn a tank of dechlorinated water, prepare crosses of gdf6a+/- zebrafish in the evening by pairing a male zebrafish with a female zebrafish. Be sure to separate the male from the female by using a divider to ensure that the embryos are born within a small range of time.\nThe following morning, pull the divider and allow the zebrafish to breed for no longer than 30 min. Collect the embryos in Petri dishes with E3 media, described in The Zebrafish Book12, and place them in a 28.5 °C incubator.\nRemove any unfertilized eggs or dead embryos, which will appear white and opaque.\nPreparation and live-imaging of zebrafish embryos\n\t\nAt 20 hpf, replace the E3 media with E3 media containing 0.004% 1-phenyl 2-thiourea (PTU) to prevent pigment production.\n\t\tNOTE: Addition of PTU at a slightly later timepoint, such as 22-24 hpf, is unlikely to interfere with the experiment due to the early age of the embryos at the time of imaging. However, it is recommended to treat the embryos early to completely prevent pigmentation as there is a band of pigmentation that appears in the dorsal eye, which can interfere with the imaging of the SOS.\nEnsure that all embryos are at the correct developmental stages at various points leading up to the time of observation. It is recommended that this is done at the stages at which somite number is clearly visible as outlined by Kimmel et al.13. Remove those that are developmentally immature.",
    "Place the embryos under a dissecting microscope, and dechorionate the embryos by gently pulling apart the chorion using fine forceps. Visualize the SOS in the dorsal eye. The SOS may appear as an indentation at the dorsal margin of the eye, and a line should be visible across the dorsal eye. For normal SOS closure, observe the embryos at around 20-23 hpf. For examination of delayed SOS closure phenotypes, observe the embryos at 28 hpf or later.\nSort the embryos that show SOS closure delay from those that do not.\nTo photograph these embryos using a dissecting microscope, prepare a Petri dish containing 1% agarose in E3. Lightly prick the center of the agarose to create a shallow hole in which the yolk of the embryo can sit when the embryo is placed on the agarose. This will ensure that the embryo is not at an oblique angle when being photographed.\nAnesthetize embryos with 0.003% tricaine in E3 and place laterally on the agarose.\nTo image the embryos using a compound or confocal microscope, transfer the embryo into 35 mm Petri dish containing a small bolus of non-gelled 1% low-melting point agarose in E3 (w/v). Quickly position the embryo laterally using a fine fishing line or an eyelash and wait for the agarose to cool. Once the agarose is firm, pour enough E3 into the dish to cover the agarose. For more details, see Distel and Köster14.\n\t\tNOTE: If using an inverted microscope, the embryo can be placed against the glass of a glass-coverslip-bottom dish and imaged with a standard 20X objective lens.\nUse a water immersion 20x objective lens to visualize the SOS with a compound microscope. Following visualization, gently pull the agarose from the embryos and fix in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or allow to continue their development.",
    "2. Protocol 2: Whole-mount immunofluorescent staining of laminin\nWhole-mount immunofluorescent staining of laminin: Day 1\n\t\nDechorionate embryos as described in Step 1.2.3, if not already done. Fix embryos in a microcentrifuge tube at the desired timepoint in freshly made 4% PFA for 2 h on a room temperature (22-25 °C) shaker. Wash in 1x PBST for 5 min, four times.\n\t\tNOTE: Following gastrulation, embryos may fix better after dechorionation.\nPermeabilize embryos in 10 µg/mL proteinase K at room temperature for 5 min. Incubation time will depend on the developmental stage at which the embryos are fixed (see Thisse and Thisse15).\nWash in 1x PBST for 5 min, four times.\nBlock embryos in a solution of 5% goat serum and 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1xPBST for 1-2 h on a room temperature shaker.\nPrepare primary antibody solution by diluting rabbit anti-laminin antibody in block solution at a 1:200 dilution.\nIncubate the embryos in anti-laminin primary antibody overnight on a 4 °C shaker.\nWhole-mount immunofluorescent staining of laminin: Day 2\n\t\nWash in 1x PBST for 15 min, five times.\nPrepare secondary antibody solution by diluting goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 antibody in 1x PBST to a dilution of 1:1000.\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible to adapt this step to suit the resources available to the experimenter by using a different secondary antibody.\nIncubate the embryos in secondary antibody overnight on a 4 °C shaker. Shield from light as much as possible from this step onwards.\nWash in 1x PBST for 15 min, four times. The embryos can be stored at 4 °C for up to a week, if necessary.\nDissection and mounting of embryonic eyes",
    "If desired, place the embryos in a small Petri dish and deyolk the embryos in 1x PBST. Do this by gently disrupting the yolk with fine forceps and removing the yolk cells through mild scraping of the yolk sac.\nPrepare the following concentrations of PBS-glycerol series solutions in microcentrifuge tubes: 30%, 50%, and 70% glycerol in PBS. Transfer embryos into 30% glycerol/PBS, making sure to place the embryos on top of the solution and transferring as little of the previous solution as possible. Wait for the embryos to sink to the bottom of the tube.\nWhen embryos have sunk to the bottom, transfer them to 50% glycerol/PBS. Repeat and transfer to 70% glycerol/PBS.\nOnce the embryos have sunk in 70% glycerol/PBS, move them to a small plastic dish for dissections.\nSever the embryo posterior to the hindbrain, and use the posterior tissue for genotyping, if necessary.\nMove the head to a glass slide, transferring as little glycerol as possible. Use forceps or other fine dissection tools to hold onto the posterior end to keep the head stationary. Use a fine minutien pin or other fine dissection tools to gently insert into the forebrain ventricle from the anterior and push downward to separate the right and left halves of the head from each other. Repeat this while moving posteriorly through the midbrain and into the hindbrain ventricle, essentially fileting the head down the midline. This minimizes manual manipulation of the eye and surrounding tissue, thereby leaving the SOS undamaged.",
    "Mount each side of the head midline down, eye up. Position four posts of vacuum grease at the corners (an appropriate distance apart for the coverslip being used) and cover with a glass coverslip, pushing down sequentially on each post until the coverslip makes contact with the samples. Pipette 70% glycerol at the edge of the coverslip so that the glycerol is pulled underneath, filling the space between the coverslip and the slide.\nImage samples within a day, or seal around the coverslip with nail polish and image samples only after the nail polish has dried. Store in the dark at 4 °C.\n3. Protocol 3: Visualization of SOS using eGFP-CAAX mRNA\nSynthesis of eGFP-CAAX mRNA\n\t\nLinearize 1 µg of pCS2-eGFP-CAAX plasmid16 with NotI in a reaction volume of 40 µL for 4 hours at 37 °C.\nTo stop the restriction digest reaction, add 10 µL RNase-free water, 2.5 µL 10% SDS and 2.0 µL 10 mg/mL Proteinase K.\nIncubate 1 hour at 50 °C.\nAdd the following to the reaction (total volume 200 µL) and proceed to next step: 50 µL RNase-free water, 20 µL 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 75.5 µL RNase-free water\n\t\tNOTE: RNase-free water is added in two separate occasions to prevent excessive dilution of the sodium acetate.\nPurification of DNA through phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation\n\t\nAdd 200 µL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and vortex for 20 s. Separate the aqueous and organic phases through centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 5 min.\nTransfer the upper aqueous layer to a new microcentrifuge tube, making sure to avoid the transfer of the bottom organic layer. Add an equal volume of chloroform to the new tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Addition of chloroform is optional, but it is recommended to ensure complete removal of phenol from the sample.",
    "Vortex for 20 s. Separate the aqueous and organic phases through centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 5 min.\nAs before, transfer the upper aqueous layer to a new microcentrifuge tube, making sure to avoid the transfer of the bottom organic layer.\nAdd 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2.\nPrecipitate DNA by adding 3 volumes of 100% RNase-free ethanol and chill at -20 °C for 15 min. Centrifuge at 18,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. A pellet should be visible. Decant the supernatant.\nWash the pellet with 100 µL of cold 70% ethanol/RNase-free water. After gently mixing to break the pellet loose, centrifuge at 18,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. A pellet should be visible. Decant the supernatant.\nAir-dry the pellet for 5 min and resuspend the DNA in 7 µL water.\n\t\tNOTE: The pellet may need to be dried for longer than 5 min depending on the airflow available.\nTranscription and purification of eGFP-CAAX mRNA\n\t\nIn an RNase-free manner, prepare an in vitro transcription reaction with a commercially available Sp6 RNA polymerase kit, using about 1 µg of purified linearized plasmid DNA obtained in Step 3.2. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Sp6 RNA polymerase must be used for the production of capped mRNA.\nAdd 1 µL of DNase (2 U/µL; RNase free) and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\nPurify the mRNA with any commercially available RNA purification kit. Aliquot the mRNA to avoid repeated freeze-thaw, and store at -80 °C.\nInjection and visualization\n\t\nObtain embryos as outlined in Protocol 1.1.\nUsing a microinjection apparatus, inject 300 pg of eGFP-CAAX mRNA at the 1-cell stage.\nScreen for embryos with the bright expression of eGFP in the eyes using a fluorescence stereoscope.",
    "Image the embryos as described in Protocol 1.2.\nAlternatively, dechorionate and fix the embryos at the desired timepoint in 4% PFA for 4 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Wash the embryos in 1x PBST for 5 min, four times, and dechorionate, if not previously done. Dissect the eyes and mount them on slides as described in Protocol 2.3.\nSubscription Required.
