    "Cell culture conditionsSf9 cells were cultivated in SIM SF Expression Medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% Penicillin-Streptomycin in shaker incubator at 28 °C, 130 rpm. Maintain the suspension Sf9 cells between 0.5 × 106-4 × 106 cells/ml.HEK293F cells were cultivated in SMM 293-TI Expression Medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% Penicillin-Streptomycin in shaker incubator at 37 °C, 130 rpm in the presence of 5% CO2. Maintain the suspension HEK293F cells between 0.5 × 106-4 × 106 cells/ml. It is best to passage the cells by no more than two months.Expression of KCC1The full-length human SLC12A4 gene (NCBI accession NP_005063) and a C-terminal Strep tag connected by a GGSSGG linker were cloned into a pEZT-BM vector.500 ng plasmid was added to 100 μl DH10Bac E. coli to Generate the recombinant bacmid.Isolation of bacmid DNA (page 20-22), transfection of Sf9 cells (page 25-28) and amplification of virus (page 30-31) were following methods from the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) (Reference 1).Measure the baculoviral titer for P2 stocks using flow cytometry with baculovirus envelope gp64 antibody (Figure 1). Briefly,In 96-well block, add 100 μl Sf9 cells/well (cell density = 2 × 106 cells/ml).Dilute virus stock 10× in an Eppendorf tube.In a 96-well plate, set up serial dilution of 10× diluted stock:250× (4 μl 10× + 96 μl media)500× (50 μl 250× + 50 μl media)1,000× (50 μl 500× + 50 μl media)2,000× (50 μl 1,000× + 50 μl media)Transfer 20 μl of serially diluted samples from 96-well plate to 96-well block.Seal block and place in shaker for 18 h at 28 °C and 200 rpm.Stain Sf9 with anti-gp64-PE conjugated antibody for 20 min in the dark and analyze cell count by flow cytometry.",
    "For infected values above 30%: IU = Total cell number × [-ln (1 - %infected value/100)] × [viral dilution factor]/(volume of inoculum); for infected values below 30% (more reliable): IU = Total cell number × (%infected value/100) × [viral dilution factor]/(volume of inoculum).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3966/bioprotoc-11-07-3966-g001.jpgFigure 1. Estimation of baculoviral titer using flow cytometry. Histogram plots of cell count as a function of PE signal, indicating distinct populations for (A) uninfected Sf9 cells, as well as (B) PE-positive infected Sf9 cells.The baculovirus was used to infect HEK293F cells of a density of 2 × 106-3.5 × 106 cells/ml at a ratio of multiplicity of infection (MOI) 20.HEK293F cells were supplemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate to boost protein expression in 8-12 h.Cells were cultured in suspension at 37 °C and 130 rpm for 48 h.Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 4,600 × g for 15 min.Purification of KCC1The cell pellet was re-suspended in 15-20 ml per liter of expression culture resuspension buffer and homogenized by sonication (2 s sonication and 5 s of pause in 40 cycles, 300 kW) on ice.Add 2% (w:v) n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM) supplemented with 0.2% (w:v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), shake on ice for 2 h to extract membrane proteins.Centrifuge at 38,000 × g for 30 min to remove the pellet.The supernatant was incubated with 2 ml per liter of expression culture Strep-Tactin Sepharose resin (IBA) with gentle agitation for 1 h.The resin was collected on a disposable gravity column, washed in washing buffer for 10 column volumes.KCC1 was eluted with elution buffer. Analyze on SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 2). Typical yield at this step is ~2-3 mg per liter of expression culture.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3966/bioprotoc-11-07-3966-g002.jpgFigure 2. 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of purified KCC1 stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue Load the sample into a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated with 1.",
    "2 column volume of SEC buffer, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C, collect 0.5 ml fractions.Pool the fractions based on the gel filtration chromatogram (Figure 3) and concentrate to 2 to 7 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filters (100 kDa cut-off) for structural analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3966/bioprotoc-11-07-3966-g003.jpgFigure 3.
