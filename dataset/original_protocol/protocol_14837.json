    "NOTE: The following experimental protocol was approved by the animal care committee of the University Health Network (Toronto, Canada) and is in accordance with the policies established in the guide to the care and use of experimental animals prepared by the Canadian council of animal care.\n1. Cervical Aneurysm Clip Contusion/Compression Model\nBefore surgery autoclave instruments and keep sterile conditions during the entire surgcial procedure by putting the instruments in a 70% alcohol bath.\nAnaesthetize Wistar rats (250-270 g) with a combination of oxygen (O2), nitrous oxide (N2O) (1:1), and 1.8-2.2% Isoflurane and support spontaneous breathing via a gas anesthesia mask. For induction of anesthesia start with 5% Isoflurane for 1 minute and reduce afterwards. Before starting surgery, control depth of anesthesia by giving a painful stimulus (e.g. at the paws). Apply fatty ointments in the eyes to avoid dryness and to prevent subsequent infections.\nPut the rats onto a heating cushion (37 °C) and fix the head into a stereotactic frame.\nShave the surgical region around the cervical spine and disinfect with povidone iodine and 70% alcohol.\nMake a midline incision above the spine from the cervical vertebra (C2) reaching to the prominent processus of the thoracic vertebral body 2 (T2).\nCut through the outer layer of the vertebral muscles directly on the midline (to avoid bleeding) in a cranio-caudal direction and further dissect the deeper muscle layers bluntly until you reach the processus spinosus and the laminae. Insert retractors.",
    "Orientate the prominent processus spinosus of the vertebra body T2 to observe the targeted levels for laminectomy. After identification and micro-surgical preparation of the selected laminae, cut through the ligamenti flavae to loosen the laminae and the processus spinosus. Finally, cut through the laminae with a bone clipper lateral to the spinal cord and remove those gently, avoiding any compression of the spinal cord itself.\n\tNOTE: Most common levels are C5/6, C6/7, or C7/T1. The perioperative mortality rate increases the more rostral the level of injury. Bleeding from the paravertebral venous sinus is common and can be addressed by careful compression with sponge.\nBefore inserting the clip to traumatize the cord, identify emerging nerve roots to spare them from clipping (especially at level C5/6).\nIn order to ensure smooth clip induction, loosen the ventral dura from the dorsal side of the vertebral bodies with a hook and prepare a corridor for the clip.\nFinally, insert the open clip and let it snap shut (rapid closure) to achieve a contusion injury. Clip closing force and duration of clip closure determine the intensity of the trauma and the extent of compression. Commonly used are clip forces of between 15-35 g and a clipping duration of e.g. 1 min. (Figure 1).\nAfter removal of the clip, adapt muscles in 2 layers and close the wound.\nStop anesthesia and let the animal wake up under your continuous observation until it regains sufficient consciousness for sternal recumbency. Finally, put the rat in a single cage and follow post-operative treatment guidelines.\nSince animals struggle with the severity of this type of injury, you must pay special attention to post-operative treatments:\n\t\nAdminister painkillers (Buprenorphine and Meloxicam for 3 days and 5 days, respectively and according to the clinical symptoms).",
    "Give additional saline solution subcutaneously for 3 days (2 times a day, 5-10 milliliter (ml)).\nProvide antibiotics in the drinking water 2 days prior and until 7 days post surgery (e.g. Moxifloxacine)\nSqueeze the urinary bladder 2-3 times a day until recovery of bladder function is constantly apparent.\nObserve neurological deficits and physiological condition of the operated animals at least once a day.\n2. Injecting SAPs and NPCs (14 days after injury)\nInduce anesthesia as described in 1.1. to 1.3, fix the head of the rat in a stereotactic frame, remove the stitches or wound clips, and disinfect the wound and the surgical area with povidone iodine and 70% alcohol.\nCarefully dissect the paravertebral muscles, insert retractors, remove scar tissue microscopically from the dura, and re-expose the lesion site.\nPrepare SAPs in a concentration of 1% (w/v) to perform an extracellular matrix gel. QL6 SAPs have a physiologically compatible pH and do not need to be buffered prior to injection. For visualization of SAPs in the spinal cord, use a fluorescent derivate of QL6 (QL6-FITC).\nInject SAPs (5 microliter (μl) into the center of the lesion, distributed in 2 portions, each 2.5 μl bilateral of the midline. Use a Hamilton syringe connected to the stereotactic frame with a micro glass capillary (100 micrometer (μm) outer diameter (OD)). Open the dura carefully with the tip of a sharp needle, and insert the glass capillary stereotactically 2 millimeter (mm) into the traumatized spinal cord.\nAfter injecting 1/3 of the volume, remove the needle to 1.5 mm depth, and after a further 1/3 to 1 mm. After injection of the entire volume, and before removal of the syringe, wait 5 minutes to stabilize gel formation.",
    "To generate NPCs, use adult DsRed mice (or YFP positive mice, green) and isolate and cultivate them from the paraventrical zone4,18,21.\nAssess viability of NPCs by Trypan Blue staining indicating the presence of ~90% live cells in the cell suspension. Dilute the cells in growth medium (50 x 103 live cells/μl) and then use them for cell transplantation.\nMake four 2 μl (8 μl total volume, containing 4 x 105 NPCs) intraspinal injections bilaterally at 2 mm rostral and caudal of the injury site. After opening of the dura, insert the Hamilton micro glass capillary 1.5 mm below the dorsal surface of the spinal cord and inject 2 μl of the cell suspension. Choose an injection rate at about 0.5 μl /min (min).\nAt the end of each injection and before removal of the capillary out of the cord, wait for at least 1 min allowing tissue stretching to accommodate the new cell volume. (Figure 2)\n3. Implantation of Subdural Pumps for Growth Factor Application\nIn order to enrich the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) with growth factors supporting cell survival, use micro-osmotic pumps diluting growth factors sub-durally throughout 7-14 days, with a dilution rate of 0.5 μl/hr, a catheter diameter of 0.04 cm OD, and a reservoir volume of 100 μl.\nChoose preferred growth factors (e.g., brain derived growth factor (BDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)), fill the pumps 6-10 hr prior implantation, and equilibrate pumps in a water bath at 37 °C.\nImmediately after NPC injections, prepare a subcutaneous recess to place the pump. Preferred locations are the lateral flanks of thoraco- abdominal region avoiding major local discomfort caused by the pump itself.",
    "To gain the highest concentration of growth factors, ensure that the open tip of the catheter ends close to the lesion site. Therefore, perform a skip-laminectomy of the adjacent upper or lower level. For example, if the SCI is at C7/T1, perform a small laminectomy of C5.\nPut the pump into the subcutaneous recess, shorten the catheter to the necessary length, and secure it with several sutures (6.0) on the paravertebral muscles avoiding any movement-associated dislocation.\nAfter opening the dura (e.g., at C5) with the sharp tip of a needle, introduce the catheter into the subdural space and let it glide in a caudal direction without any resistance and without injuring the cord. The skipped lamina of e.g. C6 serves as additional point of fixation and stabilization of the catheter.\nMake sure that the catheter runs smoothly and does not fold.\nClose muscles by layer, and skin, with sutures or clips. (Figure 3)\nStop anesthesia and let the animal wake up under your continuous observation until it regains sufficient consciousness for sternal recumbency. Finally, put them back in a single cage and follow post-operative treatment guidelines.\nProvide special postoperative treatment, even though, animals might have recovered partly at this time-point:\n\t\nAdminister painkillers (Buprenorthine and Meloxicam for 3 days and 5 days, respectively and according to the clinical symptoms).\nProvide antibiotics in water bottles 2 days prior until 7 days post-surgery (e.g. Moxifloxacine).\nContinue squeezing the urinary bladder, if still necessary.\nGive additional subcutaneous fluids, if the rats appear dehydrated.\nKeep observing the neurological function and physiological condition of the operated animals at least once a day.\nAdminister immunosuppression treatment 2 days prior NPC injection and until 7 days post transplanation (minocycline) and until sacrifice (sandimmune), respectively.\n4. Tissue Assessment",
    "Sacrifice animals at the end of the observation time (e.g. 4 weeks after SCI) in deep anesthesia (5% Isoflurane for 2-3 min) and perfuse them transcardially with 50 ml cold (4 °C) saline followed by 150 ml cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nRemove the spinal cord and put it in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hr.\nPut the spinal cords in 25% sucrose solution for cryoprotection for 48 hr.\nProvide longitudinal cryosections with a thickness of <30 μm.\nFor immunohistochemical staining of all cell-nuclei providing a background use DAPI (1:1,000). DsRed positive NPCs appear red, QL-6 FITC appears green, and both thus need not to be stained specially. (Figure 4).\nFor scanning electron microscopy (SEM) let samples soak in glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for 2 hr, dehydrate them slowly in 10% increment steps of ethanol for 5 min and place them in a pressurized liquid CO2 siphon for 1 hr. Coat scaffolds with gold using a sputter coater. Take images with a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope. (Figure 5)\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
