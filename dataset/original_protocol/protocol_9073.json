    "1. Egg Production and Collection\nZebrafish husbandry follows standard procedures described previously8. Briefly, adult zebrafish are set up in breeding tanks with dividers in place. When the lights in the room come on the following morning, dividers are removed from breeding tanks and fish are allowed approximately 20 to 60 min of undisturbed mating time.\nEggs from breeding tanks are collected in a strainer and rinsed with egg water. Eggs are then transferred to a Petri dish with egg water. Unfertilized eggs and debris are removed using a transfer pipette.\nPlace Petri dish containing the collected eggs in an incubator (28-32 °C). After eggs hatch, around two days post-fertilization (dpf), remove chorion and any other debris with a transfer pipette.\nOn desired day post-fertilization (3 to 8 dpf) remove Petri dish containing freely swimming larvae and place on lab bench at room temperature.\n2. Microelectrode Pulling and Preparation\nUsing a micropipette puller, pull a 1.2 mm OD borosilicate glass capillary into two needles and store in a 150 mm Petri dish or empty pipette box by laying over silly putty ramps. Needles can be pulled in advance. Different OD glass capillaries can be used depending on the type of amplifier headstage available.\nBackload the microelectrode with extracellular recording solution (2 M NaCl) using a 1 ml syringe with a Nalgene syringe filter (4-mm) and Microfil filament (Warner Precision Instruments) attached. Shake or tap the bolus toward the needle tip until there are few or no bubbles remaining.\n3. Immobilization in Agar\nPrepare a fresh solution of 1.2% low melting point agar in egg water. Place agar solution in a water bath set at ~37 °C.",
    "Prepare a coverslip with recording chamber and place in freezer (5-10 min). The recording chamber should match that used on the electrophysiology rig. We use a low-profile open diamond bath imaging chamber from Warner Instruments (Model RC-26GLP).\nUsing a Pasteur or transfer pipette, place one larval zebrafish in a small droplet of egg water in a clean Petri dish plate. To this droplet, add a droplet of solution containing an anesthetic (0.02% tricaine) and paralyzing agent (1 mg/ml α-bungarotoxin).\nMonitor zebrafish for loss of movement (5 to 10 min).\nRemove the coverslip/recording chamber from freezer. Place chamber on the stage of a stereomicroscope. Using a transfer pipette, mix several ml of 1.2% low melting point agarose with droplet and transfer solution (with fish) to the coverslip/recording chamber.\nUsing a pipette tip or fine blunt needle, position larvae under the stereomicroscope so that the dorsal aspect of the fish is exposed to the agarose gel surface. Allow agarose to harden (5-10 min), then using a flat spatula transfer the agar block to a recording chamber set up on an electrophysiology rig.\n3. Extracellular Field Recording\nAdd 2-5 ml of zebrafish recording media to the recording chamber. If drug changes are necessary, perfuse chamber with recording solution at a rate of approximately 1 ml/min. No oxygenation of the recording solution is necessary.\nInsert a microelectrode (approximately 1 μm tip diameter, 2-7 MΩ) into the amplifier headstage mounted on a three-dimensional micromanipulator. Check that the micromanipulator is in a proper position to allow for a range of movement and adjustment. Bring the microelectrode tip into the plane of view of the microscope, high off the stage, and using coarse adjustment lower to a point just above and slightly in front of the head of the zebrafish.",
    "With the amplifier in \"current-clamp\" mode zero the electrode.\nUsing coarse adjustment lower the electrode tip so that it just touches the surface of the zebrafish, slightly in front of the forebrain.\nUsing fine adjustment steps advance the electrode tip until it punctures the skin of the zebrafish. Allow to settle and then advance the electrode several microns into forebrain.\nRecord electrical activity in current-clamp mode using Axoscope software. Data are acquired at a sampling rate of 10 kHz.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
