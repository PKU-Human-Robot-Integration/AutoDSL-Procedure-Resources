    "Preparation of recombinant RDR6The recombinant RDR6 protein with N-terminal 3xFLAG-tags followed by a SUMOstar protease cleavage site is overexpressed by using Drosophila S2 cell expression system. This system produces higher levels of soluble recombinant RDR6 compared to plant cell-free translation systems or Escherichia coli expression systems. After lysis of the cells, the recombinant protein is purified by anti-FLAG antibody conjugated magnetic beads, and eluted with SUMOstar protease. Although we use the tag-less recombinant RDR6 protein, the N- or C-terminally tagged RDR6 can also be used for RdRP activity assay (Devert et al., 2015; Baeg et al., 2017).When S2 cells reach between 1.0 x 107 and 1.5 x 107 cells/ml in a 100-mm dish, collect them into a 50-ml tube(s). Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 3 min, remove supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet gently with Schneider’s Drosophila medium containing 10% FBS. Count the cell numbers using a cell counter plate. Seed 1.5 x 107 cells (1.5 x 106 cells/ml) in a 100-mm dish in 10 ml of Schneider’s Drosophila medium containing 10% FBS (see Notes 1 and 2).Dilute 10 μl of 1 μg/μl pAFW-SUMO-AtRDR6 plasmid with 500 μl of Schneider’s Drosophila medium in a 1.5 ml tube. Add 20 μl of X-tremeGENE HP transfection reagent to the diluent, mix by tapping, and incubate it at room temperature (~25 °C) for 10 min. Add the transfection mixture into S2 cells in a dropwise manner, gently agitate the dish in a circular motion to evenly disperse the transfection mixture, and statically incubate at 27 °C for 72 h.Collect the cells into a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube(s). Centrifuge in a swinging bucket rotor at 1,500 x g for 3 min at 25 °C. Remove the supernatant with a pipette.Resuspend the cell pellet gently in 300 μl of PBS (see Recipes).",
    "Transfer the cell suspension into a 1.5 ml tube. Centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant with a pipette completely.Weigh the cells and add an equal amount of pre-chilled hypotonic lysis buffer (see Recipes). Resuspend the cell pellet gently by tapping the bottom of the tube.Incubate the cell suspension on ice for 15 min, then vortex the cell suspension for 30 sec to disrupt the cell membrane.Centrifuge at 17,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant into the 1.5 ml tube containing Dynabeads protein G coated with anti-FLAG antibody (see Note 3). Mix by tapping, and incubate on a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h.Transfer the tube to a magnetic stand. Wash the beads twice with an equal volume of 1x lysis buffer (see Recipes) containing 800 mM NaCl and 1% Triton X-100, and once with an equal volume of 1x lysis buffer.Resuspend the beads with 100 μl of 1x lysis buffer containing 1 mM DTT, 20% glycerol and 0.05 U per μl SUMOstar protease. Incubate the slurry on a rotator at 4 °C for 20 min.Recover the supernatant in a pre-chilled tube, aliquot it into several tubes on ice, freeze with liquid nitrogen, and store at -80 °C. Measure the concentration of purified RDR6 by SDS-PAGE along with the defined dilutions of bovine serum albumin standard (PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit) after Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171227/20171227215446_4853.jpgFigure 1.

The arrow indicates purified recombinant RDR6.Preparation of template RNAsBecause in vitro transcribed RNAs often contain unwanted shorter or longer byproducts, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) purification of RNAs is essential for accurate determination of the template specificity of RdRPs.",
    "When synthetic oligo RNAs are used as the template for RdRPs, the use of HPLC purification is recommended.Transcribe reporter RNAs from DNA templates at 37 °C for 2 h using T7-Scribe Standard RNA IVT Kit following manufacturer’s instructions.Add 1 μl of DNase I, mix thoroughly and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min.Adjust the volume of the reaction mixture to 100 μl with distilled water on ice.Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol into the reaction mixture, and mix by vortexing at room temperature (~25 °C). Centrifuge at 17,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C.Recover the aqueous phase into a new tube with an equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and mix by vortexing at room temperature (~25 °C). Centrifuge at 17,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Recover the aqueous phase into a new chilled tube, add an equal volume of pre-chilled 5 M ammonium acetate, mix the solution by tapping the tube, and incubate on ice for 15 min.Centrifuge at 21,500 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and add 700 μl of 70% ethanol. Centrifuge at 17,000 x g at 4 °C for 3 min and remove the supernatant completely.Place the open tube on ice to air dry.Resuspend the pellet in 40 μl of 1x formamide dye (see Recipes). Incubate the sample at 95 °C for 5 min, mix by vortexing and load onto a urea gel containing 0.5x TBE and appropriate concentration of polyacrylamide (see Notes 4 and 5).Perform electrophoresis (see Note 6).Transfer the gel onto a plastic wrap, cover the gel with another wrap, and place it on a fluorescent TLC plate. Briefly expose the gel to UV light and excise a gel slice containing the RNA of interest (see Note 7).",
    "Transfer the gel slice into a 2 ml tube (Figures 2A-2C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171227/20171227215734_8956.jpgFigure 2. Workflow for RNA purification. A.

A gel slice containing the RNA of interest is transferred into a tube with sterilized pipette tips.Add 700 μl of PK buffer (see Recipes) and incubate the tube at room temperature (~25 °C) for 24 h on a rotator.Transfer the supernatant into a new 1.5 ml tube and add 700 μl of 2-propanol and mix by vortexing.Centrifuge at 17,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 min and remove the supernatant carefully.Add 700 μl of 70% ethanol.Centrifuge at 17,000 x g at 4 °C for 3 min and remove the supernatant.Repeat Steps B17 and B18.Air dry the pellet for 10 min and dissolve it in distilled water.Quantify the concentration of the RNA with a spectrophotometer.RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity assayThe flow chart of this assay is shown in Figure 3. After the reaction, the samples are electrophoresed on a urea gel or native gel. In urea PAGE, dsRNAs are denatured into two ssRNAs and migrate based on their molecular weights. Although RNase I treatment is essential for discrimination between RdRP products and TNTase products, this method allows the accurate estimation of the size of newly synthesized complementary strand. In contrast, because dsRNAs retain their double-helical structure in native PAGE, double-stranded RdRP products can be distinguished from single-stranded TNTase products based on their different mobilities without RNase I treatment. A drawback of native PAGE is that the mobility does not reflect the actual size of RNAs. The simultaneous use of both PAGE methods provides more accurate information for the enzymatic properties of RdRPs. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171227/20171227215906_6298.jpgFigure 3.",
