    "Procedures involving animal subjects have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Hamamatsu University School of Medicine.\n1. Preparation of Matrices\nBoil 4-8 silicone matrices in a microwave or on a hot plate for 5 min and allow them to dry completely for 1 h under laminar flow (striped side up).\n\tNote: The following procedures should be performed under laminar flow.\nBlow compressed air or use transparent sticky tape to remove any dust from the striped side of the matrices. Keep the striped side clean so it can firmly adhere to the plate surface.\nCarefully place the matrices onto 6-cm plastic dishes by pressing with a finger (one matrix per dish; stripe side down). Avoid getting air bubbles between the matrix and the dish. Mark the location of the stripes on the bottom side of the culture dish.\nIf the matrix fails to attach, repeat from step 1.2.\n2. Stripe Generation and Laminin Coating for Neuron Culture\nPrepare fluorescently labeled recombinant protein (25 µl each for injection [step 2.2] or 100 µl each for the placement method [step 2.2.1]) by mixing the Fc-tagged protein (10-50 µg/ml) and a fluorescent dye-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (1 to 3 ratio: 30-150 µg/ml) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Then, incubate the mixture for 30 min at RT.\nUsing a 22-G syringe, inject 25 µl of the recombinant protein prepared in the previous step (2.1) through the small hole on the side of the matrix (arrows in Figure 1A, 1C, and 1E).\n\t\nAlternatively, place 100 µl of the recombinant protein into the top slit of the matrix and aspirate approximately half of the solution from the small hole (arrows in Figure 1A, 1C, and 1E), so that the recombinant protein remains in the striped regions.",
    "Incubate the dish for 30 min at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator.\nPlace 300 µl of PBS into the top slit (Figure 1B) and aspirate from the small hole located on the side of the matrix (arrows in Figure 1A, C and E) to remove unattached recombinant proteins. Do not aspirate the PBS completely, because the proteins will dry. Repeat this step twice. (3 times total)\nCarefully remove the matrix and immediately place ~100 µl of control protein (10-50 µg/ml; Fc) to cover the entire striped area, creating an alternate coating. Then, incubate the dish for 30 min at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator.\nAfter washing the dish surface three times with PBS, coat it with ~100 µl of 20 µg/ml laminin in PBS.\n\tNote: Laminin should be thawed on ice to prevent solidification.\nIncubate the dish for 1 h at 37 °C in the cell culture incubator.\nWash the dish surface three times with PBS and add culture medium. Place the coated dish with culture medium in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C until use.\n3. Culturing Hippocampal Neurons from E15.5 Mouse Embryos\nEuthanize mother via cervical dislocation and isolate three E15.5 embryos.\nCut the skin and skull sagittally at the midline of the head with scissors, and remove the brain using a small spoon. Transfer the brain carefully to a 60-mm Petri dish containing 3 ml of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).",
    "Using a scalpel, cut out the hemispheres including cortex, hippocampus and striatum (Figure 2A). Then, dissect out the hippocampal region by carefully removing the meninges, and transfer the dissected hippocampal tissues to a 15-ml centrifuge tube containing 2 ml of HBSS solution, on ice (Figure 2B-C). Collect 6 hippocampi from 3 embryos in the tube, which are sufficient for culturing neurons in 8 dishes.\nReplace the HBSS solution with trypsin/EDTA solution (2 ml) and incubate the tube at 37 °C for 15 min in a water bath.\n\tNote: Aspirate HBSS without centrifugation and do not decant the HBSS solution by tilting the tube.\nNeutralize the trypsin activity by adding 500 µl of fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nCentrifuge the mixture at 100 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 2 ml of culture medium. Repeat this step once more.\nPipet the hippocampi up and down 10 times in culture medium using a 1,000-µl tip with a large hole (cut-tip) to dissociate the tissue.\nChange to a regular (uncut) 1,000-µl tip and pipet the dissociated tissue up and down to obtain a single-cell suspension.\nSeparate the single cells by passing them through an 80-100-µm mesh cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the filtered single cell suspension at 150 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant by aspirating, and resuspend the pellet (neurons) in 2 ml of culture medium.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer with trypan blue staining to determine the density and viability. Then, plate 10,000 neurons in 150 µl of culture medium for each set of stripes.The suspension should be carefully placed to cover the entire stripe region.\n4. Visualization of Cell Bodies and Axons by Immunofluorescence Staining using an Anti-Tau1 Antibody",
    "After 24 h of culture, aspirate the medium without disturbing the adherent cells, and fix the neurons with pre-warmed 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/4% sucrose/PBS at RT for 15 min.\nWash the plate surface 3 times with PBS. If desired, use a water-repellant pen to draw a circle around the striped region to decrease the amount of antibody needed.\nPermeabilize the neurons with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min.\nIncubate the neurons with blocking solution containing 3% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min followed by incubation with an anti-Tau1 antibody (1:200) in 1% donkey serum/0.1% Triton X-100/PBS O/N at 4 °C.\nWash the plate surface 3 times with PBS. Incubate the neurons with a fluorophore-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min.\nWash the plate surface 3 times with PBS. Cover the striped region with an 18 mm x 18 mm cover glass using 50 µl of antifade solution. avoid air bubbles, which interfere with the imaging.\nObtain fluorescent images with a fluorescence microscope using the appropriate system, e.g., x10 objective lens, filter sets for GFP and RFP, and 1,000-msec exposure time (Figure 3).\nSubscription Required.
