    "All human tissue work was performed using approved institutional protocols.\n1. Separation of Dermis and Epidermis from Human Skin (Juvenile Foreskin from Circumcision)\nPlace the foreskin (usually 1 - 2 cm2) into a non-adhesive sterile cell culture dish (Ø 10 cm) and cover it with 10 - 12 mL of phosphate-buffered saline+ (PBS, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM CaCl2, pH 7.2 = PBS+).Remove all excess (adipose) tissue using sterile scalpel and forceps.\nCut the skin into 3 mm x 5 mm pieces, wash them with PBS, and transfer them to a non-adhesive sterile cell culture dish (Ø 6 cm). Cover the tissue pieces with 5 - 7 mL of dispase solution (2 U/mL in PBS). Seal the cell culture dish with paraffin film and incubate for 16 h at 4 °C.\nRetract the epidermal from the dermal part with two sterile forceps. Transfer the dissected tissue pieces to individual non-adhesive cell culture dishes (Ø 6 cm) and cover each of them with PBS+.\n2. Isolation of Primary Keratinocytes from the Epidermis\nCarefully remove the PBS+ from the cell culture dish using a Pasteur pipette and wash the epidermal tissue pieces (section 1.3) with PBS. Cut the epidermis into smaller pieces (1 mm2) and collect them in a 50-mL conical tube. Add 10 mL 1x Trypsin-EDTA (preheated to 37 °C) and incubate for 5 min in a water bath at 37 °C. Vortex the tissue suspension every 2 min.\nStop the enzymatic reaction by adding 1 mL fetal calf serum (FCS). Resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down with a 10-mL plastic pipette for 4 min. Try to avoid bubbles and foam formation.",
    "Pipet the cell suspension into a cell strainer (pore size 100 µm), placed on top of a fresh 50 mL conical tube, and rinse 3x with 5 mL PBS. Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cell pellet in 2 - 6 mL culture medium containing 1% (v/v) gentamycin. Determine the cell number manually by counting cells in a hemocytometer and seed 6 x 105 cells into a T75 cell culture flask.\n3. Cultivation of Primary Keratinocytes\nIncubate primary keratinocytes isolated in step 2.3 in a cell incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in keratinocyte medium without FCS, to 50 - 70% confluency.\nTo passage the keratinocytes carefully remove the medium, add 5 mL PBS-EDTA, and incubate the cells for 10 min at 37 °C. Check if cells have started to detach from the culture flask under a light microscope (4X magnification: cells will appear rounded but are still attached!). If not, replace old PBS-EDTA with fresh PBS-EDTA and re-incubate for another 10 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 5 mL 1x Trypsin-EDTA to the rounded cells still covered with 10 mL PBS-EDTA and re-incubate them for 1 - 3 min at 37 °C. Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding 1 mL FCS and collect the detached cells in a 50-mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min, resuspend the pellet in keratinocyte medium, and seed 6 x 105 cells into a fresh T75 cell culture flask.\n\tNOTE: To generate organotypic skin reconstructs, the primary keratinocytes should be used no later than passage 3 - 4.\n4. Isolation of Primary Fibroblasts from the Dermis",
    "Cut the dermal tissue (section 1.3) into smaller pieces (1 mm2) and transfer them into a 50-mL conical tube. Add 10 mL collagenase-solution (5 U/mL in PBS+) and incubate for 45 min in a water bath at 37 °C. Centrifuge the mixture of tissue pieces and cells at 200 x g for 5 min.\nWash the cell pellet twice with 10 mL DMEM containing 4.5 g/L glucose and L-Glutamine, but without L-Pyruvate. Finally resuspend the tissue pieces in 2 mL of DMEM containing 1% (v/v) gentamycin and 10% FCS. Transfer them into a T25 cell culture flask and incubate them in a cell incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight.\n\tNOTE: The small volume allows the fibroblasts to migrate out of the tissue-debris and forces them to attach to the culture flask.\nThe next morning, add another 6 mL DMEM/Gentamycin/FCS and incubate for 2 - 3 days at 37 °C until the cells have reached 80 - 90% confluency.\n5. Cultivation of Primary Fibroblasts\nTo passage the fibroblasts, remove the medium and wash adherent cells with PBS. Add 5 mL 1x Trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 3 min at 37 °C.\nStop the enzymatic reaction by adding 5 mL DMEM/FCS and collect the detached cells in a 50-mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 5 min, resuspend the pellet in DMEM medium, and seed 6 x 105 cells into a fresh T75 cell culture flask.\n\tNOTE: To generate organotypic skin reconstructs, the primary fibroblasts should be used no later than passage 4 - 6.\n6. Generation of 3D Melanoma Spheroids Via the Hanging Drop Method\nCulture melanoma cells (e.g., 451-LU, or any melanoma cell line of interest) according to general protocols, using RPMI containing 10% FCS15.",
    "To generate melanoma spheroids of similar size and quality, wash the melanoma cells in PBS, add 5 mL of 1x Trypsin-EDTA in PBS to the cells in a T175 cell culture flask, and incubate for 3 - 5 min at room temperature (RT). Neutralize the Trypsin by adding 5 mL RPMI/10% FCS. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 200 x g for 5 min. Re-suspend the cell pellet in RPMI/FCS at a final concentration of 10,000 cells/mL as determined by counting in a hemocytometer.\nSpot 40 x 25 µL (= 250 cells) of the cell suspension onto the inner surface of the lid of a sterile non-adhesive cell culture dish (Ø 10 cm) using an electronic multi-pipette. With a fast but smooth movement, turn the lid around and place it on the respective cell culture dish containing 5 mL PBS.\n\t\nCulture \"hanging drop dishes\" in a cell incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 10 - 14 days, depending on the cell type used.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells from the MM growth phase typically grow faster and form more solid spheroids in the hanging drop compared to melanoma cells derived from the RGP or VGP. For individual evaluation, observe spheroid growth under a pair of binoculars or under a light microscope (4X magnification). Usually, spheroids become detectable after 48 h under a pair of binoculars or under a light microscope (4X magnification). After 10 - 14 days, they are visible without any magnification device.\n5 days after the initial drop spotting, add 10 µL of fresh RPMI/10% FCS medium to each drop. Subsequently, exchange 10 µL of medium every other day. The use of an electronic dispenser is very helpful in this step.",
    "Depending on the cell type, harvest the spheroids (see section 10 for details) after 10 - 15 days by gently rinsing them off the cell culture dish lid with PBS. Collect them in a fresh non-adhesive cell culture dish.\n\tNOTE: The cultivation period depends on the tumor growth phase of the melanoma cells when they were initially derived, e.g., spheroids derived from 451-LU cells grow to approximately 500 µm in diameter within 12 days of culturing in the hanging drop15.\n7. Generation of the Dermal Compartment of Organotypic Full Skin Reconstructs\nGenerate skin models using 24-well cell microporous membrane inserts (pore size 8 µm) placed in 24-well plates.\n\tNOTE: Make sure not to use hanging but standing inserts, because they will be placed into a 6-well plate for air-liquid cultivation at a later stage.\nPrepare the gel neutralization solution (GNL)15, as well as the culture media referred to as MM and endothelial growth media (EGM)16,17. To prevent coagulation, store the collagen type I (usually from rat tail, 3.5 - 4 mg/mL in 0.02 N acetic acid) on ice until use, because it starts to gel at RT.\nRe-suspend 1 x 105 fibroblasts per insert in GNL and quickly mix the cell suspension with collagen at a ratio of 1:3 in a final volume of 500 µL/insert. Mix by gently pipetting up and down to avoid bubble formation as bubbles may impair the quality of the skin reconstruct.\nAllow the individual dermal gels to settle by keeping them without medium at RT for 30 min in a sterile hood. Subsequently cover each gel with DMEM containing 4.5 g/L glucose, 1% L-glutamine, 10% FCS, and without L-pyruvate, and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\n8. Generation of the Epidermal Compartment of Organotypic Full Skin Reconstructs",
    "The next day remove the medium from the dermal gels and equilibrate them with EGM media (10% FCS, 1% PenStrep, 10 mg/mL gentamicin) for 2 h at 37 °C. Withdraw the medium and carefully seed 1 x 105 keratinocytes resuspended in 100 µL EGM on top of the dermal gel.\nIncubate the reconstructs for 1.5 h at 37 °C to allow the keratinocytes to adhere to the dermal compartment.\n\tNOTE: During this incubation time, the gels will start to shrink due to fibroblast-induced contraction, and thus, at least partially detach from the insert walls.\nCover the skin equivalents with approximately 800 µL EGM and carefully remove the residual gel from the insert wall with a small (white) pipette tip.Culture the skin equivalents submerged in EGM for 7 days in a cell incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and change the medium every other day.\n\tNOTE: During this time the skin equivalents will shrink significantly.\n9. Air-liquid Cultivation of Organotypic Full Skin Reconstructs\nAt day 8, transfer each insert into an individual well of a 6-well plate. Only add 1.2 - 1.4 mL of MM medium to each well, so that the skin reconstruct is supplied with medium from the bottom of the well but is not covered with medium.\n\tNOTE: Cultivation at the air-liquid interface allows stratification of the epidermal part and establishment of a full cornified layer (stratum corneum).\nDuring the next 10 - 17 days, change the medium as stated in section 9.1 every other day. During this period, add drugs or other stimuli as needed to the medium. Carefully remove the full skin reconstruct from the microporous membrane insert using curved tweezers for further analysis, e.g., immunohistochemical analysis (Figure 1).\n10. Generation of the Organotypic Melanoma Spheroid Skin Models",
    "To integrate the melanoma spheroids into the dermal compartment of the organotypic full skin reconstructs, carefully rinse the spheroids (after step 6.4) off the lid of the hanging drop cell culture dish with PBS. Collect 10 - 20 spheroids/insert in a sterile non-adhesive cell culture dish. Carefully remove excessive PBS with a Pasteur pipette.\nAspirate the spheroids in the smallest volume possible of EGM. At this point observe and count the spheroids with the naked eye, without any further magnification device. Take 10 - 20 spheroids per skin model/gel, as stated in step 10.1.\nTransfer them to the desired volume of GNL containing fibroblasts (during step 7.3), and mix with the collagen type I. From this step on proceed as described in sections 7.3 - 9.1.\n\tNOTE: Tumor spheroids become visible in the dermal gel as white spots (Figure 2)"
