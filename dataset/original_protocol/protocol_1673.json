Incubate cells at 37°C, ∼3 min.\nResuspend cells with 8 mL CL4 media.\nIn a 35 mm glass bottom dish (CellVis), add 300 μL (∼2 × 105 cells) to 1.7 mL CL4 media with appropriate selection antibiotics.\nIncubate at 37°C for 16h and use for imaging once cells grow to ∼50–80% confluency.\nOptional: Use a Plasma Cleaner to prepare the surface of 35 mm glass bottom dishes before plating to ensure efficient cell spreading and adherence. See manufacturer’s guide for instructions. It is not necessary to coat with fibronectin or laminin unless cell lifting during acquisition becomes an issue. See troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7].\nCritical: Plating cells at the correct density is critical for visualizing the growth of nascent microvilli. CL4 cells undergo differentiation in a contact-dependent manner, with full apical brush border maturation occurring ∼4–5 DPC. Cells in confluent monolayers have dense arrays of apical microvilli and new growth events are difficult to visualize and less likely to occur at this stage. Thus, it is to image cells that are sub-confluent or have only recently reached confluency (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1230-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of optimal cell density for capturing microvillus growth events\nCells are growing in sub-confluent islands.\nOptional: Plate multiple glass bottom dishes of cells at different dilutions to ensure that the optimal density for imaging is covered. See troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nSpinning disk confocal imaging\nTiming: 30 min/movie",
    "We perform spinning disk confocal imaging using a Nikon Ti2 inverted light microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk head, a Photometrics Prime95B sCMOS or Hamamatsu Fusion BT sCMOS camera, and 488, 561 and 647 nm excitation LASERS as described previously (Gaeta et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Meenderink et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Samples are loaded into a heated stage top incubator system maintained at 5% CO2 (Tokai Hit) and then imaged using a 100× oil 1.49 NA TIRF objective (Nikon instruments).\nBefore loading samples into the microincubation chamber, confirm with transmitted light microscopy that cells are present in sub-confluent islands or recently reached confluency (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Cells that have been confluent for > 1 day will no longer be suitable for observation of nascent microvilli growth events.\nLoad a glass bottom dish into the microincubation chamber maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 and humidity.\nOptional: We typically use CL4 medium with phenol red (DMEM + 10% FBS, + 1% L-glutamine) for imaging. However, Fluorobrite (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% L-glutamine may also be used to decrease background fluorescence.\nUsing a 100×/1.49 NA oil immersion objective, find a cell expressing your protein(s) of interest.\nDetermine whether the cell is suitable for observing microvillus growth events. Suitable cells typically satisfy the following conditions (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1230-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example of a CL4 cell expressing EGFP-EPS8 (green) and mCherry-ESPN (magenta)\nThis cell satisfies conditions outlined in Step-by-step details 3a. Most notably, microvilli are sparse enough to observe nascent microvillus growth events and the mCherry-ESPN signal is sufficiently high over background. Scale bar = 10 μm. Zoom inset scale bar = 2 μm.",
    "Protein(s) of interest are expressed at moderate levels. This is defined as high enough expression to produce a SNR adequate for imaging, but low enough to avoid aberrant localization (relative to that observed with endogenous staining) or phenotypes. A microvilli signal ∼1.2–2× the cytoplasmic signal is a good starting point.\nMicrovilli are sparse enough that growth of new protrusions will not be obscured by existing protrusions.\nA majority of the apical surface volume can be imaged in a 3–5 μm z-depth imaging volume (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1230-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Optical sectioning of CL4 cells over time to capture apical surface dynamics\n(A) Representative schematic of oversampling in the z dimension to enable deconvolution.\n(B) Stepwise acquisition settings.\nDesign acquisition routine in Nikon Elements “ND Acquisition” window (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nConfigure lambda (channel series) settings (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B arrow 1). Select the excitation/filter set of interest. In our case we will choose FITC X1 (488) and TRITC X1 (561).\nConfigure time interval and duration (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B arrow 2). Standard time interval is 30 s for 30 min duration. This can be adjusted based on experimental needs.\nSet laser power. For our system, we typically set the laser power to no more than 4% and exposure time to no more than 100 ms to minimize photobleaching. However, the laser power setting may vary depending on the system and total initial power of the LASERs used for excitation. The goal is to achieve a microvilli signal at least 1.2× the cytoplasmic signal using the lowest possible laser power and exposure time settings. We recommend keeping laser power and exposure time settings consistent between cells within an experiment if quantitative intensity measurements will be collected.",
    "Set the z-step size (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C arrow 3). Nikon Elements will suggest a step size to achieve Nyquist sampling (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C, magenta box). However, to maximize the performance of deconvolution in postprocessing, we typically over-sample in Z; using a 100×/1.49NA objective the step size is set to 0.18 μm or less (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nSet Perfect Focus (or equivalent automatic focusing system) to the middle of a symmetric imaging volume (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, green box). 4 μm is a good starting point (+2 μm above, −2 μm below midpoint) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B arrow 4).\nSet order of experiment to Lambda(Z series) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B, arrow 5). This allows for acquisition of the total imaging volume per channel before switching channels.\nPress “1 time loop” (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B arrow 6)\nScroll through imaging volume to see if a majority of the apical surface volume is captured.\nProceed with imaging if a majority of the apical surface volume is captured. If not, adjust the middle focal plane and press “1 time loop”. If a majority of the apical surface volume is still not captured, repeat step 3.\nRun the acquisition.\nSet up file path to ensure automatic saving (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B arrow 7).\nPress “Run Now” (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B arrow 8).\nNote: Finding “optimal” imaging conditions requires patience and balancing many factors. For example, a cell may present with sparse microvilli and protein(s) of interest expressed at reasonable levels, however a 5 μm z-depth imaging volume may be insufficient to capture the bulk of the apical surface.\nNote: For tips on minimizing cell death during the acquisition, see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]."
