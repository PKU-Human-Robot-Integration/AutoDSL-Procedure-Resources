  "procedures": [
    "The present study and procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Second Military Medical University (Shanghai, China) in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (US National Research Council, 1996).\n1. Animals\nUse Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of two months (200–250 g). For each behavioral assay, use a separate group of rats. Always use separate control and experimental groups.\n\tNOTE: There were two autonomic tests: EVM and FWR. The EVM had three conditions in addition to a control group (= 4) with three behavioral assays (balance beam, defecation counting and open field = 3) with 8 rats in each for a total of 96 rats (4 x 3 x 8). The FWR had one condition in addition to a control group (= 2) with three behavioral assays (balance beam, defecation counting and open field = 3) with 8 rats in each for a total of 48 rats (2 x 3 x 8). In total, we report 144 rats.\nCage rodents under a constant 25 °C temperature and 60%–70% humidity.\nHouse rodents in 12 h/12 h light/dark cycles with access to food and drinking water ad libitum.\n\tNOTE: Since the following protocols are behavioral experiments, rats should be handled gently. Handling animals should be with both hands with body and rear support, so as not to induce anxiety.\nPerform experiments (EVM and FWR) and evaluation assays (balance beam and open field evaluation) in the darkness to minimize visual cues.\n2. Elevator vertical motion device\nPerform the elevator vertical motion procedures in complete darkness to minimize visual cues.\nPlace the rodents in the Plexiglas box (22.5 cm x 26 cm x 20 cm). Here the Plexiglas box can accommodate four rodents (custom-made device).",
    "Ensure the box is fastened shut and securely closed to avoid rodents falling out. Place the Plexiglass box on the elevator pad of the elevator vertical motion device (custom-made device).\nTurn on the elevator vertical motion device to the lowest setting for acclimatization.\nSet the amplitude as 22 cm up and 22 cm down from neutral. Incrementally change elevator vertical motion as follows:\n\t\nSet the initial periods as 2,500 ms for 5 min, 2,000 ms for 5 min, and 1,500 ms for 5 min.\nUse a test period of 1000 ms for 2 h.\nSlow the device in reverse using periods of 1500 ms for 5 min, 2000 ms for 5 min, and 2500 ms for 5 min.\n3. Ferris-wheel rotation device\nFerris-wheel rotation device setup\nPlace the plexiglass container (22.5 cm x 26 cm x 20 cm) on a wooden bench (custom-made device).\nPlace the rodents in the plexiglass container with the long axis of the body perpendicular to the horizontal rotation rod of the Ferris-wheel (custom-made device).\n\t\tNOTE: The placement with body perpendicular to horizontal rod ensures stimulation of otolith organs (anterior-posterior and vertical direction) during rotation.\nClose the plexiglass box securely.\nPlace the second set of rodents in the plexiglass container with the long axis of the body perpendicular to the horizontal rotation rod on the second arm of the Ferris-wheel rotation device. Use a second set of rodents with similar mass to balance the Ferris-wheel.\nSecurely close the plexiglass box and place on the Ferris-wheel rotation device.\nFerris-wheel rotation procedure\nPerform the Ferris-wheel rotation procedures in complete darkness to minimize visual cues.",
    "Start the Ferris-wheel rotating in a clockwise direction at 16°/s2 to reach an angular velocity of 120°/s, and then begin to decelerate at 48°/s2 to reach 0°/s. After a 1 s pause, have the container continue to rotate in a counterclockwise direction in the same manner as above (acceleration at 16°/s2 to reach an angular velocity of 120°/s and then deceleration at 48°/s2 to reach 0°/s). The clockwise-pause-counterclockwise cycle requires approximately 10 s to reach its initial position.\nContinue the clockwise-counterclockwise rotation for 2 h per session for approximately 720 rotations.\n4. Evaluation of EVM and FWR\nNOTE: The evaluation of Ferris-wheel rotation device and elevator vertical motion is done by three procedures: balance beam testing, defecation counting, and open-field examination. Identical procedures are used to evaluate elevator vertical motion. These evaluation procedures should be done as soon as possible after Ferris-wheel rotation or elevator vertical motion.\nBalance beam\nBalance beam setup\nSet up the balance beam10,11,12 by placing two wooden stools (approximately 0.75 m in height) in the experimental field, approximately 110 cm apart.\nPlace a black plastic box (15 cm x 15 cm x 8 cm) on the finish stool.\nPlace a narrow wooden beam (2.5 cm x 130 cm) between the two stools, leaving a 100 cm distance between the stool edges, from the start stool to the finish stool.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The entrance to the black plastic box should be at the finish line of the 100 cm.\nPlace a lamp at the start stool. Turn on the lamp.\nTurn off the room lights and ensure that the room is as dark as possible. This ensures the rodent follows the direction of the balance beam from the lighted region to the obscured region.\nBalance beam procedures",
    "NOTE: The motor coordination assay of the balance beam is assessed by measuring the time taken to traverse the elevated wooden beam.\n\t\t\nTrain each rodent daily for 3 consecutive days, before the examination period, in order to achieve stable performance on the balance beam10. Train by introducing the rat to the beam in the lighted corner and prompting it to cross the beam. Eventually the rat will cross of its own volition. Rats in the present protocol took 3.6 ± 0.9 seconds.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Some rodents fail to achieve stable performance during training and should be excluded. Some rodents do not perform the task while others lack motivation to cross the beam. Stable performance was two consecutive trial periods of crossing times less than 4 seconds. If a rat falls off during training or assessment it should be categorized as a rat 'fall' and not assessed further.\nFor the actual procedure, place the trained rodent on the start stool near the light and simultaneously press start on a stopwatch. The rodent should cross the balance beam rapidly and enter the black box on the finish stool.\nPress start on the stopwatch once the rodent is in place and press stop when the nose enters the dark box on the finish stool. The time to traverse the beam is from start stool to finish stool.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Once the rodent is trained, you may perform an intervention or manipulation, such as inducing motion sickness, prior to evaluation. You may also obtain a baseline measurement, prior to the intervention, using the time to traverse of the last training session.\nDefecation counting\nPlace the plexiglass container containing the four rodents on a bench after the Ferris-wheel test period.\nRemove the rodents and place in individual open-field boxes (below).",
    "Count the number of feces pellets in the plexiglass box attributed to each rodent.\n\t\tNOTE: A baseline measurement can be obtained, for comparison with the evaluation after elevator motion, by counting feces pellets prior to undergoing elevator vertical motion.\nOpen-field examination\nPlace the rodents in the open-field box (40 cm x 40 cm x 45 cm).\nRecord open field behavior using an IR-video camera for 3 min28,29,30.\nDetermine the total distance traveled.\n\t\tNOTE: It is very important NOT to place the rodent in the open-field box before elevator vertical motion. The environment must be novel to the rodent. Therefore, baseline measurements should NOT be taken for open-field examination.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
