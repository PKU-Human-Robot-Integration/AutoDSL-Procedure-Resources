    "All animals were housed in a barrier animal facility at Baylor College of Medicine per Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines and under approved animal protocols.\n1. Collection of Mouse Liver Tissue\nPreparation of mouse for liver harvest\nEuthanize the mouse using isoflurane.\nPerform cervical dislocation of the mouse to ensure death.\nMake a transverse incision approximately one inch below the rib cage.\nExpose the entire ventral surface of the liver.\nCollection of the mouse liver\nCarefully, with small scissors, cut through the ligaments connecting the liver to other organs in the abdomen.\nCut through the common BD to detach the liver from the intestine.\nCarefully remove the liver by holding onto the gallbladder and immediately place in a 50 mL tube filled to three-quarters by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\n2. Fixation and Embedding the Liver in Paraffin\nFixation\nFix the liver tissue for 48 h in 4% PFA at 4 °C.\nWash the tissue with 70% EtOH for 1 h at 4 °C.\nWash the tissue twice with 95% EtOH for 1 h each at 4 °C.\nWash the tissue twice with 100% EtOH for 1 h each at 4 °C.\nClearing\nWash the liver tissue with clearing agent (Table of Materials) three times for 30 min each at room temperature.\nNOTE: The liver should feel rigid following the third wash.\nEmbedding in paraffin\nPlace the tissue cassette in a tissue mold in paraffin wax for 3 washes, 30 min each. Wax should be preheated to 60 °C.\nFill the tissue mold with paraffin wax to three-quarters height and keep on a heating block at 60 °C.\nPlace the liver in the mold with the ventral side facing up.\nCarefully remove the mold from the heating block.",
    "Place the top of the cassette on the mold and top off with hot liquid paraffin.\nAllow the mold and block to cool to room temperature overnight.\nNOTE: Tissue blocks can now be stored at room temperature.\n3. Sectioning liver tissue\nPreparation of the block for sectioning\nPlace the mold on ice for 5 min before removing the block from the mold.\nPlace the block on ice with a lab tissue paper present between block and ice.\nKeep the block on ice when not sectioning for best tissue slicing results.\nSectioning the liver blocks\nUsing a microtome, begin by sectioning through the superficial, dorsal side of the liver. Sections should be 5 µm.\nCheck the superficial sections under a dissection microscope to ensure sections are not sheared or folded.\nTake a section of the liver that includes the caudate lobe.\nNOTE: For some blocks, you will have the left, medial, right and caudate lobes on the same tissue slice.\nFor those blocks where all four lobes are not present on the same slide, continue to slice until the left, medial and right lobes are present on the same slide.\n4. Immunohistochemistry for wsCK and αSMA\nProcessing of slides for immunohistochemistry\nSelect one slide per genotype to be analyzed.\nWash the slide for 15 min in Xylene, 100% EtOH, 95% EtOH and finally 70% EtOH (3 x 5 min in each solution).\nWash the slide for 5 min in deionized H2O.\nImmerse the slide in the antigen retrieval solution (Tris-based, high pH).\nHeat under pressure in a pressure cooker for 3 min at 10 psi.\nAllow the slide to cool to room temperature (approximately 35 min).\nBlocking the tissue sections\nUsing a Pap Pen, outline the sections on the slide.",
    "Apply phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.1% Tween to cover the section twice, 5 min each.\nMake blocking buffer by mixing Normal Goat Serum (NGS) at 1:50 in PBS + 0.3% Triton. To have enough buffer for both blocking and primary antibody application, 100 µL per section is sufficient.\nApply 100 µL of blocking solution per section.\nIncubate the slides covered with the blocking solution at 4 °C for 1 h.\nStaining for wsCK and αSMA \nDilute anti-CK8 and anti-CK19 antibodies16 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, TROMA-I and TROMA-III, respectively) 1:20 in blocking buffer to stain for wsCK. Dilute the anti-αSMA antibody17 (Table of Materials) to 1:200 in the same buffer.\nApply 100 µL of the diluted antibody solution containing all three antibodies to each section.\nIncubate the slides covered with the antibody solution at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the slides with PBS + 0.1% Triton three times, 5 min each.\nDilute secondary antibodies (anti-rat-Alexa488 and anti-mouse-Cy5) 1:200 in PBS + 0.3% Triton.\nApply 100 µL of the secondary antibody solution containing both secondary antibodies to the slides.\nIncubate at room temperature for 1 h.\nDAPI nuclear staining and mounting\nWash the slides three times, 5 min each.\nApply 100 µL of DAPI (1:3000) to each section for 10 min.\nApply Antifade Mounting Medium (Table of Materials) to the slides and place a glass coverslip on top of the tissue sections. Leave the slides at 4 °C overnight. Seal the slides the next day.\nStore the slides at 4 °C and image within 1 week of mounting.\n5. Imaging and Quantification of BDs\nImaging liver sections\nPrior to imaging, blind yourself to the genotype of the sample with help from a lab member. Ensure all imaging files are devoid of genotype or other specific identifying information besides an animal/sample number.",
    "Using a fluorescent microscope, take 20x images at 1x zoom of each section and ensure that every PV across the liver is imaged. Include the left, medial, right and caudate lobes.\nNOTE: We usually find 60-90 portal tracts per animal depending on the size of the liver.\nTo identity the PVs, look for αSMA plus wsCK staining. Structures that are αSMA positive but lack wsCK staining are not portal structures.\nIdentification and counting of BDs\nCreate a spreadsheet with the following columns: Animal/Sample Number, Image Number, Number of PVs, and Number of BDs.\nGoing through each image, identify and record the number of PVs per image.\nIdentify patent BDs in each image by the presence of cholangiocytes (wsCK+) surrounding a definable lumen. Structures should be distinct and separated by mesenchyme from other wsCK+ cells.\nCount each patent BD and place in the same column as the image number.\nDo this for each image taken of a PV.\nCalculate the sum of all PVs and all BDs in the liver sample.\nCalculate the BD to PV ratio for the liver sample.\nSubscription Required.
