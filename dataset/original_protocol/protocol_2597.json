    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare for indoor flight simulator trials – Day of experiment\nTiming: 1–2 h before trials\nIn this section of the protocol, we describe how to prepare the workspace for conducting flight simulator trials under indoor, controlled testing conditions. This process consists of two major steps that are to be done on each day of experiments prior to conducting any trials: 1) preparation of the experimental room for the specific treatment or control conditions for trials to be conducted; 2) checking that all aspects of the flight simulator apparatus are in working order.\nPreparing the flight simulator and treatment conditions for indoor trials\nTiming: 2 min (for steps 1a and 1b)\nTiming: 5 min (for step 1c)\nTiming: 1–2 min (for step 1d)\nTiming: 5 min (for step 2)\nNote: This protocol summarizes the indoor, controlled testing of butterflies, such as migratory monarchs, during their subjective nighttime in response to nighttime light pollution stimuli as conducted by Parlin et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Tests subjecting butterflies to other stimuli during their subjective night can use this protocol. Similarly, if animals are to be tested during their subjective daytime under indoor, controlled conditions in response to daytime occurring stimuli, the same protocol can be used.\nAdjust (if necessary) and record ambient testing conditions.\nSet the temperature of the room at the desired level for trials.\nNote: We have found that temperature settings between 20°C–22°C work well for flight simulator trials. For reference, if temperatures are too cool (e.g., below 10°C) or too hot (>32°C), monarch flight motivation is decreased to the point where they do not fly consistently during trials. See Calibrating the flight simulator and trial conditions, sections 18.a and 18.b for setup and checking of temperature conditions.",
    "Check that the relative humidity level of the testing room is neither too dry (e.g., < 10% humidity) nor too humid (e.g., > 80% humidity).\nNote: See Calibrating the flight simulator and trial conditions, section 19.a for setup and checking of relative humidity conditions.\nCheck that the artificial lighting to be used for trials are set to the appropriate testing conditions (see Calibrating the flight simulator and trial conditions, sections 16 and 17).\nCritical: Check that the position of the light source(s), the intensity of the light source(s), and the wavelengths of light (spectral properties) emitted by the light source(s) are set to the specific conditions to be tested for trials.\nCheck that any magnetic, acoustic, and vibratory sensory cues are controlled or eliminated during trials.\nCritical: When selecting a suitable testing room, the initial calibration process to control for these conditions in the experimental room can take 60 min. On each day of trials, each pre-experiment check takes 1–2 min (see Calibrating the flight simulator and trial conditions, sections 12 and 14).\nPrepare flight simulator apparatus for trials.\nCheck that the flight simulator is positioned as desired in the room (see Calibrating the flight simulator and trial conditions, sections 13.a and 13.b).\nCheck that all cables that connect equipment are connected.\nCheck that any relevant switches, e.g., on button, or gain knobs or intensity controls, are on or placed at the appropriate setting for trials, respectively.\nPrepare animals for indoor flight simulator trials – Day of experiment\nTiming: Immediately before an individual trial",
    "In this section of the protocol, we describe how to prepare animals that will be tested in indoor, controlled flight simulator experiments. This process consists of the steps of 1) transporting the animals from where they are housed to the testing location under darkness and 2) acclimating the animals to the specific conditions that they will be tested at during trials.\nPreparing animals to be tested in the flight simulator\nNote: This protocol summarizes the indoor controlled testing of migratory monarchs in response to exposure to an acute stimulus simulating outdoor nighttime light pollution (i.e., light trespass) that occurs in urbanized settings during the subjective night of the butterflies. This protocol can also be used for testing monarchs at night when exposed to other types of nighttime light pollution (e.g., over-illumination) or other types of sensory cues or pollution that occur at night. This indoor testing protocol allows researchers to specifically isolate the potential effect of nighttime light pollution stimuli, while controlling other sensory and environmental variables that are either difficult or impossible to control, e.g., outdoor ambient temperature and noise, during experiments conducted under outdoor field conditions.\nNote: For trials during the subjective day of the butterflies or in response to other treatment/control conditions, this protocol can also be used to facilitate the performance of controlled experiments. Just make sure to omit portions of the protocol where the animal is kept in the dark (e.g., during handling from the incubator to the flight simulator).\nBring monarchs to be tested from where they are housed to the flight simulator testing location.\nMake sure that monarchs are not inadvertently exposed to light prior to a trial, by handling all monarchs in the dark before trials.",
    "Use red-light, e.g., a headlamp equipped with red-light, in order to be able to quickly and safely transfer the butterflies to the experimental room while in the dark.\nCritical: Do not expose monarchs to light (e.g., full-spectrum) during their subjective night phase, as light exposure might negatively affect their circadian clock and induce unwanted circadian phase shifting (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] – problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] for ways to deal with accidental light exposure at night).\nNote: Ideally, the room in which monarchs are held (incubator room) is not that far from the experimental room. If necessary, transport butterflies in a dark box that cannot have light penetrate.\nNote: If the room in which butterflies are held (incubator room) is a far distance away from the experimental room for indoor flight simulator trials, butterflies can be transported when contained in their individual housing (in a container preventing light exposure or under darkness) to the experimental room or an adjacent room, prior to trials.\nOptional: Butterflies can be held under darkness an hour before trials, to facilitate keeping each test animal in the dark until its trial has started.\nConducting flight simulator trials – Day of experiment\nTiming: During an individual trial\nIn this section of the protocol, we outline the procedure for conducting a flight simulator trial with an animal. This process consists of three major steps: 1) introducing and attaching the tethered butterfly into the flight simulator apparatus under darkness; 2) conducting the trial and ensuring that data (orientation data from flight simulator trials) are collected; and 3) returning the animal back to its housing conditions after a trial has been completed.\nConducting flight simulator trials (e.g., light trespass and other nighttime light pollution conditions).",
    "While in the dark, remove a butterfly from its glassine envelope housing and install the tethered monarch inside the flight simulator.\nNote: In our setup, this handling process takes approximately 30 s to complete.\nOnce the monarch is tethered, turn on the light according to the parameters of the stimulus to be tested.\nNote: For light trespass conditions, the light is immediately turned on after the monarch is tethered in the flight simulator. The latency for when the light should be turned on during a trial will vary with the type of stimulus conditions occurring during a trial, however.\nConduct flight trial for the desired trial duration.\nNote: For flight trials with monarchs, a trial of 5–10 min is suitable to assay the orientation behavior of individuals.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nMake sure that orientation data are collected by the flight simulator system prior to removing the monarch from the simulator.\nNote: Unless otherwise indicated by a specific testing protocol, we only test monarchs and obtain orientation data for that butterfly once per day.\nAt the end of a trial, immediately turn the light off.\nRemove the butterfly from the flight simulator and immediately return it to its glassine envelope.\nNote: Aim to have this process be of similar duration as at the setup of trials, i.e., when placing the tethered butterfly within the simulator (approximately 30 s).\nReturn the butterfly to its incubator while in the dark.\nNote: Use the same process for transporting butterflies in the dark, e.g., transport the butterflies in a box that does not let light penetrate."
