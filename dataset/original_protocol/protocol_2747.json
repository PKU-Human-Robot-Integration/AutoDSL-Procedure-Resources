    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nViral injection\nTiming: 30 min setup + 30 min per mouse\nThe first aim of this protocol is to optically access DRN neurons expressing a fluorescent indicator of neural activity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). This is achieved in two surgeries, a viral injection and lens implantation. In this first step, the calcium indicator GCaMP6m is virally expressed in serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). These methods follow standard practice for viral injections in the mouse brain, except for that the virus must be injected at an angle to avoid a confluence of blood vessels in the vertical path above the DRN.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2409-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. In vivo imaging of the mouse DRN using miniature microscopy\nA GRIN lens is implanted through a craniotomy in the mouse skull at a posterior angle to avoid major sources of bleeding in the vertical path above the DRN. Cells in the DRN express an indicator of neural activity, e.g., the calcium indicator GCaMP. The baseplate allows for the attachment of a miniature microscope during imaging sessions.\nThe morning of the viral injection surgeries, assemble the required materials.\nPrepare a 1% dilution of 50 mg/mL carprofen in sterile PBS for perioperative analgesia. This surgery will require approximately 0.25–0.3 mL per mouse for a final dose of 5 mg/kg.\nRetrieve and dilute the virus.\nFill a Styrofoam bucket with ice.\nRemove aliquots of the virus from the −80°C freezer and allow them to thaw in the in the ice bucket for 5 min. You will need approximately 1 μL per mouse.\nCentrifuge the tubes containing the virus for several seconds to ensure the entire volume is collected at the bottom of each tube.",
    "If using more than one aliquot, combine aliquots into a single PCR tube using a P10 pipette and the corresponding 10 μL pipette tips.\nDilute the virus with the virus dilution buffer.\nCritical: The dilution ratio will depend on the concentration of viral particles, which is reported by the supplier. The final concentration should be approximately 2 × 1012 vg/mL to avoid toxicity at higher concentrations.\nPrepare the surgical equipment.\nLoad a fresh drill bit into the micro drill.\nTurn on the micro drill, light source, digital stereotax display, and the digital controller for the injector.\nAttach the injector to the stereotax and load the Hamilton syringe onto the injector.\nAdjust the stereotax arm to have a lateral angle of 22° relative to the vertical axis (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2409-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Angles of virus injection and lens implantation\nBoth the needle used for viral injection and the GRIN lens are inserted at angles to avoid major sources of bleeding in the vertical path above the DRN.\n(A) The virus is injected at a lateral angle of 22 degrees. The needle should be angled relative to the vertical path above the DRN and be parallel to the coronal plane.\n(B) The lens is implanted at a posterior angle of 32 degrees. The lens should be angled relative to the vertical path above the DRN and be parallel to the sagittal plane. AP, anteroposterior; DV, dorsoventral; ML, mediolateral.\nUsing the knobs on the stereotax, move the syringe in all dimensions to ensure the tip of the needle can reach the approximate injection coordinates.\nNote: If using the right arm, it may be necessary to rotate it counterclockwise for injection left of the midline, and vice versa.",
    "Critical: Ensure the stereotax arm and injector are secure at the angle of 22°. The weight of the injector can cause the arm to slowly fall to a greater angle. This would interfere with both the leveling of the head (step 14) and the accuracy of the injection.\nAt the surgery station, lay out the required surgical tools: scissors, curved forceps, straight forceps, hemostat, sutures, drill bits, Q-tips, shaver, scalpel, scalpel blade, SUGI spears, 70% ethanol, betadine, eye lubricant, 1 mL syringe, 1 syringe needle per mouse, Vetbond, Topicaine, and a Hamilton syringe loaded with a 33-gauge NanoFil needle.\nNote: For the use and care of Hamilton syringes, consult the manufacturer’s instructions.\nLoad the virus into the syringe.\nSlide one of the ear bars inwards, towards the middle of the stereotax.\nNote: The ear bar is a convenient surface, but any flat surface reachable by the injection needle is acceptable.\nWrap the ear bar with parafilm.\nUsing the P10 pipette, deliver a drop of up to 10 μL of the diluted virus onto the parafilm.\nMove the tip of the needle into the middle of the drop. To do this accurately may require the use of the stereoscope.\nWithdraw the entire drop into the Hamilton syringe using the digital controller.\nNote: Note that the volume marking at the meniscus is often less than the volume pipetted due to evaporation during step 4 and the dead space in the needle itself.\nPull up the needle using the stereotax knobs and swing the stereotax arm to the side.\nCritical: Throughout the surgery, be careful not to bump the needle. If this happens, you can discard the bent needle and replace it with another without ejecting or withdrawing the virus. Remember to prime the needle following replacement as in step 16.c.",
    "Ensure the heating pad is on, and warm enough to provide thermostasis (37°C).\nInduce anesthesia with 3% isoflurane delivered via the SomnoSuite system at 500 mL/min.\nWhen the mouse is fully anesthetized, divert the isoflurane to the nose cone of the stereotax, reduce anesthesia to 1.5%, and adjust the oxygen flow rate as required. For the SomnoSuite system, the flow rate should now be approximately 80 mL/min.\nPlace the mouse in the stereotax.\nOpen the mouse’s mouth with curved forceps.\nFit the front teeth (upper incisors) into the hole on the mouse holder.\nCritical: The bar that goes into the mouse’s mouth can push the tongue back and obstruct the mouse’s airway. Be sure the tongue is not pushed back. You may even grab the tongue with your forceps when placing the mouse in the stereotax.\nMove the mask into place and tighten.\nCritical: It is essential to monitor the level of anesthesia of the mouse throughout the surgery. If the mouse’s breathing changes, they appear to awaken, or respond to a toe pinch, slowly and gradually adjust the percentage and/or flow rate of isoflurane until breathing normalizes and the pain response is absent.\nPosition ear bars so that the head is stable.\nImmediately after placing the mouse in the stereotax, lubricate its eyes with ophthalmic ointment.\nInject the mouse subcutaneously with 0.25–0.3 mL of the carprofen solution prepared in step 1.a.\nNote: For particularly large or small mice, the volume of the injection should be adjusted to achieve a dose of 5 mg/kg.\nShave the fur from the mouse’s head.\nSterilize the skin with Q-tips soaked in betadine and 70% ethanol. Move the Q-tips in a spiral from the center to the edge of the shaved area. Alternate the solutions for a total of 3 cycles.\nExpose the skull.",
    "View the mouse’s head through the stereoscope.\nUsing straight forceps, pinch a small patch of shaved skin at the base of the head.\nUsing scissors, make an approximately 1-cm incision along the midline to expose the skull.\nCritical: The incision must expose both bregma and lambda and make space for the burr hole which will be drilled several millimeters lateral to lambda. Avoid extending the incision past bregma, as suturing near the eyes can be difficult and interfere with the mouse’s ability to close its eyes.\nUsing two fresh Q-tips, clear the fascia from the surgical field by pulling it in opposite directions until it tears.\nLevel the head.\nMove the injection needle back into place so that the 22° rotation of the stereotax arm is perpendicular to the mouse (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: Alternatively, the stereotax arm can be kept upright for this step. If so, be sure to zero out the digital controller with the needle at bregma after angling the arm before moving on to step 15.\nMove the needle so it just barely touches bregma.\nZero out the digital controller.\nRaise the needle and move it back to lambda.\nLower the needle so that the tip just barely touches lambda.\nIf the z-coordinate reads less than -0.05 or more than 0.05 mm, lower or raise the head bar of the stereotax, respectively, and repeat this step.\nCritical: When adjusting head position, take care not to let the mouse fall out of the ear bars and avoid trauma to the face by loosening the nose cone before raising or lowering it.\nDrill the craniotomy.\nMove the needle so that the tip just touches the skull at the anteroposterior and mediolateral injection coordinates (-4.5 AP, 1.12 ML).",
    "Note: The mediolateral injection coordinate will be either positive or negative depending on which way the stereotax arm is rotated.\nThis is where you will drill the burr hole for the injection, so identify and remember landmarks on the skull relative to the tip of the needle. Alternatively, you can mark the spot on the skull with a surgical skin marker.\nMove the needle out of the way to make room for the drill.\nDrill a small burr hole (approximately 0.5 mm in diameter) using the Micro-Drill at the coordinates.\nNote: If the dura is still apparent after drilling, it can be removed gently using a 27G needle in a circular motion.\nStem any bleeding by quickly absorbing blood using a SUGI spear. If necessary, the hole can be further cleaned with Q-tips and sterile saline.\nInject the virus.\nMove the needle back to the AP and ML coordinates.\nMake sure the needle will be able to pass through the hole to the brain when lowered. If not, move the needle out of the way and expand the hole using the drill.\nPrime the needle.\nSet the digital controller of the injector to inject 60 nL at 30 nL per second.\nWith the needle still raised above the skull, repeatedly “inject” this volume until you see a drop of liquid form on the tip of the needle.\nNote: Especially before the first injection after filling or replacing the needle, the volume of air that needs to be ejected can be relatively substantial.\nUse a Q-tip to absorb this drop before lowering the needle into the brain.\nLower the needle into the brain to a dorsoventral coordinate of -3.2 mm.\nInject 400 nL of virus at 100 nL per minute.\nWait 5 min after the injection finishes.",
    "Raise the needle up to a dorsoventral coordinate of -3.1, and again inject 400 nL of virus at 100 nL/min.\nWait 10 min after the injection finishes before pulling the needle out of the brain.\nNote: A total volume of 800 nL of our diluted virus (2 × 1012 vg/mL, AAVDJ-DIO-EF1a-GCaMP6m, Stanford GVVC) was required to achieve spread throughout the entire DRN and did not appear toxic. The total volume of this injection may need to be optimized for use with a different virus.\nSuture the two sides of the incision together using, for example, interrupted or locking stitches, and apply Topicaine.\nHolding each side together with forceps, apply a small amount of Vetbond along the length of the incision for extra security.\nPlace the mouse in a recovery cage for 30 min before returning it to its home cage. The recovery cage is simply an empty cage with bedding and water only.\nFor 1 week post-operatively, keep a CPF-treated MediGel in the mouse’s cage for analgesia.\nPause point: Wait 3 weeks between the viral injection and lens implantation to allow for viral expression and therefore visualization of neurons during implantation.\nNote: Although it is possible to inject the virus and implant the lens in the same surgery, we do not recommend this. Injecting the virus in advance of implanting the lens allows for more accurate targeting by visualization of cells and/or fluorescence during implantation. Additionally, lenses in animals without cells or fluorescence can be retracted, cleaned, and used for the next animal.\nGRIN lens implantation\nTiming: 30 min setup + 1 h per mouse",
    "The implantation of a GRIN lens for miniature microscopy is adapted from previously published protocols.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] The typical method calls for the lens to be implanted vertically. To image the DRN, the lens must instead be implanted from a posterior angle (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) because the vertical path above the DRN contains a confluence of major blood vessels. Posterior implantation then requires the severing of several muscles attached to the skull to allow space for the building of the headcap.\nPrepare materials and equipment.\nPrepare Surgifoam by soaking small (1–2 mm) chunks in sterile PBS in a weigh boat.\nAttach the Proview system to the stereotax arm and load the lens according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Swing the arm to the side.\nPrepare all other equipment as described in steps 2 and 3, excluding the injector and its digital controller, and including the miniature screws.\nRepeat steps 5–13 for preparing the mouse for brain surgery.\nCritical: Make sure the incision and clearance of fascia goes far enough back to see the muscles that attach to the posterior lambdoid suture (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nSever the trapezius and occipitalis muscles attached to the posterior lambdoid suture as depicted in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2409-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparing the surgical field for DRN lens implantation\n(A) Diagram of the mouse skull from above. The landmarks that are visible during surgery are labeled.\n(B) Steps to prepare the skull for lens implantation and building of a stable headcap.\nNote: Bleeding may occur. Stem the bleeding with styptic powder and/or surgical foam placed between the severed muscle and skull.\nPlace the head screws.\nDrill two small holes (approximately 0.5 mm in diameter) in the parietal bones of the skull as depicted in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].",
    "Note: The coordinates of these holes should be approximately 1–2 mm anterior to lambda and 2 mm lateral to the midline. If the holes are small enough, i.e., 0.5 mm in diameter, the screws should not fall through and will be sturdy when screwed in. Otherwise, you can drill only partially through the skull and only penetrate using the screws.\nScrew a miniature screw into each hole.\nOnce the screws are stable enough to stand without being held up by the screwdriver, screw them 1.5 turns further.\nCritical: Visually assess the protruding length of the screws compared to their total length throughout this step to ensure they are not deep enough to touch the brain.\nUse the lens to level the skull as in step 14. Be careful that the lens does not touch the skull.\nBuild the first part of the head cap.\nEnsure that the skull is dry using Q-tips or lightly blowing on it with a compressed air canister.\nMix cement according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.parkell.com/SSP%20Applications/NetSuite%20Inc.%20-%20SCA%20Elbrus/Development/PDFs/IFUs/CB-Metabond-ifu.pdf]. An appropriate amount of cement can be prepared by combining one scoop of Metabond powder, 5 drops of base, and one drop of catalyst.\nNote: The cement is initially liquid and solidifies over a period of several minutes. For this step, the cement should be viscous and applied carefully to avoid seepage, especially onto the severed muscles.\nCreate a cement cup as illustrated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nStart by applying the cement along the posterior lambdoid suture.\nExtend the cement wall to the screws. Ensure that the cement forms a continuous wall that contacts the skull along its entire length.\nWait approximately 10 min for the cement to dry before proceeding.",
    "Critical: The height of the walls of the cement cup should be approximately 1–2 mm. This is most important for the posterior wall. If the wall is too high, it will interfere with the lowering of the lens. If this occurs, ensure the cement is completely dried, and then use the Micro-Drill to file down the obstruction. Then repeat step 25 to ensure the skull is still level.\nAdjust the stereotax arm holding the lens so that it is angled posteriorly by 32° (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCritical: Make sure the stereotax arm is stable at 32°. If the angle increases even slightly due to the weight of the arm, the lens will not hit the target.\nLocate the implantation site and drill the craniotomy.\nMove the stereotax arm so that the lens is at bregma. To do this, imagine a line from the center of the bottom of the lens projecting towards bregma.\nZero out the digital controller and move the lens back to -6.53 mm AP and 0 mm ML.\nVisually identify and remember any landmarks around the target. Alternatively, mark the skull with a skin marker at these coordinates.\nMove the lens up and to the side to make room for your drill.\nDrill a craniotomy of approximately 1 mm in diameter in this location.\nCritical: The hole needs to be wide enough for the lens to fit, and long enough for the lens to be lowered at an angle.\nIf the dura is still visible through the hole, remove it using a 27G needle in a circular motion.",
    "Critical: Before implanting, make sure the lens and implantation site are free of debris. Lens paper can be used to clean the surface of the lens. If there is bleeding from the craniotomy, absorb it with a SUGI spear. Sterile saline and Q-tips can then be used to clear the implantation site of any debris.\nNote: It is not necessary to aspirate, cut, or pierce the tissue along the intended lens tract prior to implantation.\nImplant the lens.\nMove the lens back to the coordinates (-6.53 mm AP and 0 mm ML) and begin to lower it into the hole.\nTurn on the imaging LED using the imaging software. For details, see the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NoZpTuGgGRMYaWzPDjB7H-AE6PXJ6fra/view].\nOnce the lens enters the brain, proceed slowly by advancing the lens by 0.1 mm, pausing 5 s, drawing the lens up by 0.05 mm, and then pausing for 5 s.\nNote: If new bleeding from the craniotomy begins during the lowering of the lens, soak up the blood with a SUGI spear.\nProceed until you see in-focus cells as in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nNote: In some cases, you will not see cells during implantation, but will see fluorescence during implantation and cells 1–2 weeks later during imaging experiments. In this case, stop advancing the lens when you see fluorescence and are near the typical DV coordinates. The final DV coordinate in our hands is approximately -3.8 mm. If there are no cells or fluorescence in the field of view, consult Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nNote: If there are no cells or fluorescence in the field of view, the lens can be reused by retracting it and cleaning it gently with ethanol and lens paper. In this case, either euthanize the mouse or close the incision and provide post-operative care as described in steps 34–36.",
    "Once you reach the coordinates, take a snapshot of the field of view, and turn off the imaging LED.\nFinish the head cap.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2409-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Lowering the lens into the DRN and assessing the field of view\n(A) Anatomy of the mouse skull relevant to lens implantation.\n(B) Lowering of the lens into the craniotomy and final head cap. This diagram is specific to the use of an Integrated lens. When implanting a Proview lens, the baseplate is substituted with an adapter, which should not be cemented.\n(C) Example fields of view during implantation (step 29) or baseplating (step 40). Note that a total lack of fluorescence has a distinctly different tone. Scale bar = 200 μm.\nWith the lens and microscope still in place, mix cement as in step 26.b.\nFill in the cement cup using toothpicks to reach the correct location. The cement should be liquid enough to fill the cup but not seep into the craniotomy.\nContinue building as much of the headcap as you can until you run out of cement, maximizing contact with the implant.\nWait 15–20 min, or until the cement is completely dry.\nCritical: Do not get cement on any components other than the implant, especially the scope, implantation equipment, and the hole for the screw that secures the scope in the baseplate or holder.\nRetract the scope while holding the head cap steady with forceps.\nIf necessary, mix a new batch of cement as in step 26.b and further build up the head cap.\nIf using Proview lenses instead of Integrated lenses, mix a small amount of Kwik-Sil and, using a toothpick, fill the bowl around the top of the lens to protect it. If using an integrated lens, attach the baseplate cover and secure with a screw.",
    "Suture the incision to close the wound around the headcap and apply Topicaine. You may use Vetbond to secure sutures, but do not glue the skin or sutures to the headcap itself.\nPlace the mouse in a recovery cage for 30 min before returning it to its home cage. The recovery cage is simply an empty cage with bedding and water only.\nFor 1 week post-operatively, keep a CPF-treated MediGel in the mouse’s cage for analgesia.\nIf necessary, singly house the mouse for the rest of the experiments.\nNote: Some mice can be housed together with headcaps on, while others will remove each other’s head caps. If group housing is important for your experiments, you may test the viability of group housing with a small cohort.\nPause point: If using Integrated lenses, wait 1–2 weeks for the mouse to recover before beginning imaging experiments. If using Proview lenses, wait 1 week and then perform the baseplating step described below.\nBaseplating\nTiming: 20–30 min per mouse\nWhen using Proview lenses, the baseplate must be aligned with the lens and cemented in place during a separate procedure. The following steps describe this procedure. Note that this section does not apply to those using Integrated lenses.\nInduce anesthesia, place the mouse in the stereotax, and lubricate the eyes as in steps 5–9.\nRemove the rubber mold from the top of the lens using straight forceps.\nLower the baseplate and attached scope at a posterior angle of 32 degrees until the field of view is acceptable as described in step 29.d and shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nNote: If there are no cells in the field of view, consult Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nMix cement and apply with toothpicks to attach the head cap to the baseplate.",
    "When the cement is dry, raise the scope as described in step 31.\nPause point: Begin imaging experiments as early as 2 days after baseplating. If during this period, the field of view is lost, consult Troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]. If the head cap detaches, consult Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nImaging\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nImaging experiments should be conducted according to the miniscope manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NoZpTuGgGRMYaWzPDjB7H-AE6PXJ6fra/view]. For imaging in the DRN using the calcium indicator GCaMP6m, we recommend an LED power of up to 1.8 mW/mm2, a frame rate of 20 Hz, and a maximum imaging duration of 30 min per session. To prevent cable tangling, the use of the Inscopix commutator is recommended. To avoid losing the field of view, we recommend imaging on consecutive days and limiting the length of the experiment to 1–2 weeks. However, in several animals we have observed normal activity and a consistent field of view for up to 4 weeks.\nHistology\nTiming: 1.5 weeks\nThis step is necessary to determine the placement of the lens in the brain. The tissue fixation step is like other histology protocols, except for the prolonged fixation of the head with the implant still in place. Considerations for determining lens placement are also standard, save special considerations for determining the imaging plane of an angled implant using coronal brain sections.\nHarvest brains.\nOnce behavioral experiments are completed, perfuse mice transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] This step requires a perfusion pump, fine scissors, decapitation scissors, needles, ketamine, paraformaldehyde, PBS, a spatula, and curved hemostats.\nDecapitate the mouse with decapitation scissors and place the entire head with lens and head cap still attached into 4% PFA and store at 4°C for 72 h.",
    "Critical: The lens should remain in place during the additional fixation period following cardiac perfusion. This modification of standard mouse brain harvesting is recommended to strengthen the lens tract enough to be distinguishable from the nearby fourth ventricle after sectioning.\nPause point: Allow heads to incubate in PFA for 72 h.\nRemove the head cap by gripping the base with hemostats and pulling upwards, in the direction parallel to the lens.\nDissect brains and place them in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C.\nPause point: Wait until the brains sink before proceeding. This usually takes 2–3 days.\nFreeze and section brains.\nPlace each brain in an embedding mold and cover in OCT.\nCritical: Make sure that the brain is oriented so that it lays flat on the bottom of the mold, the olfactory bulbs are nearly touching one side of the mold, which should be labeled ‘Front’, and that the anteroposterior axis is perpendicular to this front wall.\nFreeze the embedded brain by placing it in a −80°C freezer for at least 30 min.\nPlace the embedded brain in the cryostat 20–30 min before sectioning so that its temperature equilibrates. The temperature of the cryostat should be between −18°C and −20°C.\nSlice the brain in 30–50 μm sections.\nUnless otherwise required for your experiment, discard sections until just before the DRN.\nThen, collect sections serially – one per well in a 24-well plate with PBS – until the end of the DRN.\nNote: To prevent degradation of the tissue and GCaMP fluorescence, proceed to the next step within 7–10 days. Alternatively, sections can be stored for up to 3 months at 4°C in PBS with 5% sucrose and 0.05% sodium azide.",
    "Note: To reduce the required number of well plates, you can ‘start over’ on the same plate when you reach the last well. The ordering of sections is preserved using anatomical landmarks.\nDetermine lens placement.\nMount floating sections serially on Superfrost Plus microscope slides.\nAllow the slides to dry for 20–30 min at room temperature (68–74°F) in a slide box or slide storage folder. Ensure that the slides are not exposed to light while they dry.\nPipette approximately 100 μL of Vectashield mounting medium onto the center of the slide and mount the coverslip. Lower the coverslip slowly to avoid bubbles.\nVisualize sections using a fluorescence microscope.\nNote: Because the lens was implanted at an angle relative to the coronal sections, you will see a progression from the anterior edge of the lens to the center of the bottom of the lens where the tract will be lowest and widest, to the posterior edge of the lens, which will be deeper but thinner, and successive oval tracts that are more and more dorsal.\nNote: To facilitate the following step, you may take a picture or pictures of the section(s) at low magnification (2.5–5×) using a camera attached to the microscope and a computer with imaging software.\nDetermine the coordinates of the lens location using a mouse brain atlas.\nNote: Typically, the lens location is recorded as the coordinates at the center of the bottom of the lens; however, note that the imaging plane spans from the anterior to posterior edge of the lens tract.\nMotion correction\nTiming: 5–10 min per movie",
    "Motion of the field of view during calcium imaging is a significant barrier to extracting single-cell activity data, and motion in the brainstem is much greater than in other areas. Because of this, popular algorithms, including the one employed by the Inscopix Data Processing Software, often fail to correct for motion in DRN imaging data. Fortunately, brainstem neurons typically have baseline activity, and therefore baseline fluorescence, in every frame of the movie. This facilitates a simple motion correction algorithm based on cross-correlations between each frame and a reference. The movie is first filtered and processed to crudely subtract background fluorescence, thus highlighting cells. Then, cross-correlations of each frame to a representative reference frame are calculated and each frame is offset to maximize this value. By default, the reference frame is the first frame of the movie. If the first frame is known to not be representative, the reference frame can be adjusted according to the instructions in the second paragraph of Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nSample data can be downloaded here[href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/19QS5Ltl7dfHKJCYXUL4mKRsVCEjz6Tk6/view?usp=share_link]. This movie is a temporally downsampled clip of a representative movie recorded during repeated footshocks.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nPre-process the movie in the Inscopix Data Processing Software application (IDPS). In the same step, you will spatially downsample the movie by a factor of 4 for final dimensions of approximately 250 × 250 pixels and crop the movie to the field of view. It should be a circle inscribed in a square.\nOptional: Spatially bandpass the movie in IDPS.\nNote: Spatial bandpassing is unnecessary but harmless at this stage. Both the motion correction and cell segmentation algorithms incorporate forms of spatial bandpassing. It is, however, convenient for visualization of the data before processing.\nExport either the cropped raw movie, or the cropped and spatially bandpassed movie, as a TIFF.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2409-Fig5.jpg",

    "Constrained non-negative matrix factorization for microendoscopic data (CNMF-E) is a common algorithm used to parse calcium imaging movies into single-unit activity traces. For complete details of the this method, see Zhou et al.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Correlated activity and residual motion in movies from the brainstem can cause two issues with this method of segmentation: multiple units interpreted as a single unit (cell merging), and single units interpreted as multiple units (cell splitting). The methods described below address both issues by combining CNMF-E background subtraction with manual ROI selection.\nSubtract background with CNMF-E.\nInitialize CNMF-E as previously described.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nNote: We recommend running CNMF-E using the program’s demo_endoscope.m script. The code deposited with this protocol includes a copy of this script with parameters set for use with the sample data. Note that the sample data must first be motion corrected before running CNMF-E. For DRN movies, we suggest using single-stream processing (to reduce the incidence of cell splitting); an optimized maximum diameter of cells in the range of 15–25 pixels; a Gaussian kernel width of one third of this value; and a minimum local correlation and peak-to-noise ratio of at least 0.9 and 12, respectively. To reduce cell-splitting, we additionally use a merge threshold of [0.6 0.6 0], which requires higher spatial correlation, but slightly lower temporal correlation, than the default settings. Note that this initialization step involves initialization, two iterations of CNMF-E without manual intervention, and applying the results to the full resolution movie if necessary (demo_endoscope lines 1–170). Depending on the computer’s hardware, this step will take 20–40 min for a standard movie with 10,000–20,000 frames.",
    "Note: Depending on the movie, these parameters may need to be adjusted. The maximum diameter of cells will depend on the size of cells in the movie. The Gaussian kernel width is optimally one third of this value. For data from the DRN, the minimum correlation is set relatively high, and the peak-to-noise ratio relatively low. The higher the minimum correlation, the fewer non-cell units will be detected by the program. A lower peak-to-noise ratio allows for the detection of cells with a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. Other parameters, e.g., merge thresholds and deconvolution parameters, are less important when using this protocol, because CNMF-E is used only for background subtraction and not compiling the final set of cells.\nDuring manual intervention (demo_endoscope lines 172–173), split merged cells and trim large components to achieve units comparable to those shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A.\nNote: CNMF-E commonly misinterprets the lens edge as cells. Be mindful of the approximate location of the lens edge in the field of view and delete units that are either on or outside of it.\nRun a third and final iteration of CNMF-E (demo_endoscope lines 174–194). This will take 10–20 min depending on the computer’s hardware.\nOptional: To improve the quality of the image used for ROI selection, repeat step b.\nNote: Steps after line 195 of the demo_endoscope script are optional for this protocol.\nSave the results by entering the command below.\n>> save_cnmfe\nNote: The key files saved are a standard deviation projection of the background-subtracted, denoised movie, to be used for ROI selection, and the background-subtracted movie (Ysignal), to be used for generating traces.",
    "Note: Although Inscopix Data Processing Software now implements CNMF-E, it does not provide the necessary level of manual intervention or the required outputs to be compatible with the following steps. For this protocol, CNMF-E must therefore be run natively in MATLAB.\nSelect ROIs using CalTracer.\nOpen CalTracer by entering caltracer3beta into MATLAB.\nUnder Image, select ‘Open’.\nSelect the standard deviation projection of the deconvolved movie that was saved in step 49.d.\nSelect ‘Okay’ to the next pop-up window. Because there is only one image, this value is irrelevant.\nSelect ‘Next’.\nEnter an approximate cell diameter. This is only for automatic detection, which will be deleted in favor of manual drawing.\nClick ‘Detect’. Then select ‘Delete’ near the bottom right of the GUI and click on ROIs to delete them. Press escape to exit delete mode.\nNow select ‘Add’ and begin drawing ROIs. To confirm each ROI, double click inside it. Examples are shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B.\nNote: It is helpful to identify cells by adjusting the brightness and contrast of the image.\nUnder the ‘Export’ tab, select ‘Export contours to file’, and save the contours to your computer.\nGenerate traces.\nLoad the contours saved in CalTracer into your MATLAB workspace. By default, this variable should be called CONTS.\nApply the contours to the background-subtracted movie to generate raw traces using the following code.\n>> Ysignal = loadmovie;\n>> traces = generate_traces(Ysignal,CONTS);\nIn the pop-up window, select the background-subtracted movie, here defined as Ysignal. Each value in the timeseries for a trace will be the average fluorescence within the ROI.\nZ-score traces to account for differences in average brightness between cells. Use the following code.\n>> traces = zscore_traces(traces);",
    "To generate spatial footprints that are compatible with cell registration software for longitudinal tracking of single cells,10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] run the following code. In the pop-up window, select the denoised movie from CNMF-E, here defined as Yac.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2409-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Artificially correlated activity can arise from neuropil contamination, insufficient background subtraction, or motion in the z-plane that causes cells to get brighter or dimmer as they all move closer or further away from the lens, respectively. The following control analyses are designed to determine whether neuropil contamination or z-motion contributes to correlated activity, and whether z-motion contributes to activity in response to behavior.\nNote that the time required for this section varies widely by step. Steps 54 and 55 require 2–4 h. Step 56 requires 6–8 weeks, but can be completed concurrently with the experiments detailed in previous sections.",
    "Determine whether neuropil contamination contributes to correlated activity.\nRepeat steps 50 and 51, but instead of tracing cells, select ROIs with the size and shape of cells in the area between cells, i.e., the neuropil.\nNote: This can be done in a randomly chosen subset of movies instead of across the entire dataset.\nDetermine whether the pairwise correlation between neuropil ROIs is significant. The script neuropil_ROI_analysis.m provides code for each of the steps below.\nFirst compute pairwise correlation values between traces in each movie.\nRepeat for neuropil ROIs in the same movies.\nThen, compute the chance level of pairwise correlation by shuffling the traces in time and iteratively calculating correlation values.\nFinally, compare the distributions using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests.\nNote: These tests are performed using the native MATLAB function kstest2, for which the equations are given in their documentation[href=https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/kstest2.html]. If cells in the dataset are highly correlated, the distribution from real cells should skew significantly greater than chance. The distribution of neuropil ROIs, however, should be similar to chance, as demonstrated by either an insignificant p-value or a relatively small D-statistic.\nCalculate the pairwise distances between cells and check for a correlation between distance and activity using the script correlation_vs_distance_analysis.m. If activity is more correlated between neighboring cells, this may indicate that local background fluorescence or neuropil has not been sufficiently subtracted by CNMF-E.\nDetermine the effect of z-motion on observed activity.\nNote: Because z-motion is theoretically subtracted during CNMF-E, the traces used for this analysis will be generated from the raw movie, after crudely subtracting the background using a spatial bandpass filter.\nUse CalTracer as in step 50 to generate ROIs from a standard deviation projection of a spatially bandpassed copy of the raw movie.",
    "Note: If not already done, the spatially bandpassed movie can be generated using IDPS. The projection can be generated by loading the movie into ImageJ, and using the Image>Stacks>Z-project function.\nGenerate traces as in step 51.\nLoad the offsets data from motion correction performed in step 48.\nUse the code in the script zmotion_modeling_analysis.m to regress the traces against x and y motion, which are a proxy of z-motion.\nCompare z-motion to activity.\nCalculate and/or visualize z-motion changes in response to behavior using the same method for calculating activity changes in response to behavior.\nCalculate and/or visualize the same values at randomly chosen timepoints to judge the quality of the z-motion modeling. Z-motion traces should closely model the noise of traces generated as in step 50b.\nVisualize activity in response to behavior after subtracting the fitted z-motion from the activity traces.\nCritical: In cells where z-motion modeled noise well, activity responses to behavior should still be present. If instead they are eliminated by subtracting z-motion, any responses to this behavior in the real dataset may be due to residual z-motion.\nRepeat steps 1–48 of this protocol using a virus encoding GFP instead of GCaMP.\nNote: Because GFP is a static indicator, CNMF-E will not be able to identify cells in these movies. The effect of z-motion on activity in real movies can, however, be indirectly addressed by repeating the z-motion analysis as in step 55 on these GFP movies. Fluorescence should closely model x-y-motion, and subtraction of this motion should abolish any responses to behavior."
