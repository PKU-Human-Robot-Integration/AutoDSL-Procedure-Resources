Here, we detail a reliable and effective protocol for hippocampal neuron culture.\nHippocampal harvest\nTiming: 30 min\nSterilize tools with 70% ethanol 30 min before dissection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection of hippocampus from newborn mouse\n(A) A set of surgical tools, including an angled scissors, curved tweezers, blunt tweezers, fine tweezers, and fine scissors.\n(B) A P0−1 pup. Scale bar: 1 cm.\n(C) An isolated head in the dish containing ice-cold Dissection Solution. Scale bar (2 mm) also applies to panels (D–J).\n(D) A head after exposing brain.\n(E) An isolated brain.\n(F) A dissection microscope. The arrow shows a frozen-cold iron plate under a dish.\n(G) The location of the hippocampus in the ventromedial region of cerebral hemisphere.\n(H) Hippocampus marked with a dotted line, a “C”-shaped structure.\n(I) Isolated hippocampal tissue.\n(J) Chopped hippocampal tissue.\nPrepare the Dissection Solution, Papain Solution and Plating Medium.\nTransfer 10–15 mL of ice-cold Dissection Solution to each of four 60-mm Petri dishes. The solution should be enough to cover the tissue in the dish. Keep dishes on ice.\nDecapitate a P0‒P1 pup with angled scissors and keep the head in the first dish (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C). Always keep a frozen-cold metal plate under the dish to keep the Dissection Solution cool.\nNote: 1) Both male and female pups will be used. 2) 3–4 metal plates should be precooled in a −20°C freezer for 2–3 h before dissection. The plate under the dish should be replaced with one precooled in the freezer every 10–15 min.\nRemove the scalp with two tweezers.",
    "Pin down the head by impaling the eyes with blunt tweezers; make a small incision at the midline between the eyes with the tip of another curved tweezers, then open the skull along the midline between the incision and the foramen magnum. Keep cuts shallow to avoid damaging the brain.\nUsing tweezers, remove the two halves of the skull (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D), separate the brain from the skull base, and transfer the isolated brain to the second dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nUnder the dissection microscope (1×) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F), hold the brainstem with blunt tweezers and remove cerebral hemisphere with fine tweezers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nGently peel off meninges surrounding the hippocampus with fine tweezers. The hippocampus, a C-shaped structure, should be clearly visible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H). The concave side of the hippocampus, facing a ventricle, should be already free.\nUse blunt tweezers to pin down the cerebral cortex and isolate the hippocampus along its convex side with fine tweezers. Using a cut 1-mL pipette tip, transfer the hippocampal tissue to the third dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I).\nUse fine scissors to cut off the remaining dentate gyrus and subiculum around the hippocampus as much as possible; transfer the cleaned hippocampal tissue to the fourth dish.\nChop each hippocampus into 5–10 pieces with fine scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J).\nOn average, it takes 6 min to dissect 1 pup, or 30 min to dissect 5 pups.\nUse a 1-mL tip to transfer all chopped tissues into a 15-mL tube and wash them with 10 mL of ice-cold HBSS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) twice.\nRemove 90% of the ice-cold HBSS before digestion.\nHippocampal digestion and dissociation\nTiming: 80 min\nUsing a 1-mL tip, transfer the hippocampal tissue to a 15-mL tube containing 5 mL 37°C Papain Solution.",
    "Remove any bubbles that cause the tissue to float. Incubate the tissue in the 37°C incubator for 45 min, occasionally shaking gently.\nDuring this period, make up the 1/1 Solution and 10/10 Solution.\nUsing a flame-sterilized tweezers, place a 25-mm coverslip coated with mouse laminin and poly-D-lysine in each well of a 6-well plate. Keep the plate in the 37°C incubator until cell plating.\n45 min later, transfer the hippocampal tissue to a 15-mL tube containing 2 mL of 1/1 Solution to stop digestion.\nUse a 1-mL tip to triturate the digested tissue 2–3 times, allowing the tissue to settle to the bottom of the tube before each trituration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Then, gently pipette them up and down 5 times until all pieces are broken up uniformly. After trituration, the suspension should appear cloudy without any large pieces of tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Trituration of hippocampal tissue\n(A) Before trituration, the digested hippocampal tissue in 2 mL of 1/1 Solution settled to the bottom of the tube.\n(B) Using a 1-mL tip to triturate the tissue.\n(C) After one trituration, hippocampal tissue becomes smaller pieces.\n(D) After trituration two more times, the suspension appears cloudy without any large pieces left.",
    "Critical: Trituration is critical to cell yield. Improper trituration will cause low yield or cell lysis. An effective trituration is detailed as such: set the desired volume of a 1-mL pipette gun to 750 μL; depress the plunger to the first stop; immerse the tip in the solution, firmly push the tip against the bottom of the tube, then tilt the tip at a small angle to form a narrow gap between the bottom of the tube and the tip edge. When the depressed plunger is released slowly, the tissues are aspirated into the tip through the tight gap. Friction between the tissue and the gap dissociates the clumps of neurons into individual neurons. Move the tip away from the bottom of the tube and gently depress the plunger to push the suspension out of the tip. Repeat the trituration 2–3 times until the large pieces of tissue disappear.\nAt RT (22°C–24°C), spin down the suspension at 100 × g for 5 min. Carefully aspirate off 95% of the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 2 mL of 1/1 Solution and pipette up and down 5 times with a 1-mL tip until the pellet is completely dissociated.\nAllow the suspension to settle for 10 min at RT in the tissue culture hood. Undissociated tissue will sink at the bottom of the tube.\nGently remove 95% of the supernatant and layer it on the surface of 10 mL of 10/10 Solution in a 15-mL tube, rotating the tube while layering to achieve an even distribution.\nAt RT, spin down at 100 × g for 10 min. To count cells, remove 98% of the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 3 mL of Plating Medium (3 is the dilution factor, see step 28). Pipette it up and down 5 times.\nCell plating",
    "Timing: 20 min\nAdd 10 μL of the cell suspension to the hemocytometer to count the cells under a light microscope (10×).\nCount the cells in a square chamber (1 × 10−4 mL = 1 mm in length × 1 mm in width × 0.1 mm in depth) (black dash box, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). For accuracy, count the cells in each of four square chambers, use the mean value to estimate the total yield with the following formula:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Culture and development of hippocampal neurons\n(A) Under a light microscope (10×), the cells within a square chamber (marked with a black dash box) of the hemocytometer will be counted before cell plating. Bright dots are cells.\n(B) In a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, 6-well plates with coverslip-plated neurons are placed on the top of empty 6-well plates.\n(C) Under a light microscope (10×), cultured neurons were imaged at 1 h after cell plating. Scale bar (100 μm) also applies to panels (D and E).\n(D) Cultured neurons at DIV7 are ready for transfection.\n(E) Cultured neurons at DIV14 are mature and ready for imaging experiments.\n(F–H) Zoomed-in views of neurons shown in (C, D, and E).

It is difficult to distinguish between them under a microscope. Cells with short neurites are neurons (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F). 2) 10%–20% of cells in the suspension are dead, which will be excluded from total.\nAdd 2 mL of the cell suspension to each well of a 6-well plate (1 mL/well for a 12-well plate or 0.5 mL/well for a 24-well plate). Make sure the entire coverslip is covered by the suspension.\nKeep the plate in the 5% CO2, 37°C incubator (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nMaintenance of cultured cells\nTiming: 20 min\nCells will be cultured in the incubator from the day of plating to day 21 in Vitro (DIV21). In this period, check the cells under the light microscope (10×) every 2–3 days; feed them every 3–4 days by replacing 50% of the medium in wells with pre-warmed Feeding Medium each time.\nTimeline of maintaining the cultured cells.\nAt DIV0, plate the cells.",
    "At DIV2‒3, to limit proliferation of glial cells, add Cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C), a post-mitotic inhibitor, to the medium. Its final concentration is 2–3 μM.\nCritical: 1) Glial cells support the development and growth of neurons in culture. Overgrown glial cells, however, inhibit neuronal growth and cause them to intermingle with neurons, making imaging experiments more difficult. Therefore, application of Ara-C is one of the critical factors in good culture. 2) Prepare 2 mM Ara-C solution, store in the −20°C freezer, best used within 1 year.\nAt DIV7, transfect the cells (see steps 34–41).\nAt DIV14, neurons are mature and ready for imaging experiments. Most coverslips will be used within one week (DIV14−DIV21).\nAfter DIV21, the remaining coverslips will be discarded due to the gradual decline in health and SypH expression of neurons.\nTransfection\nTiming: 1 h 15 min\nUse Lipofectamine as a carrier to transfect synaptophysin-pHluorin (SypH) into the hippocampal neurons at DIV7 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a promoter is inserted into a pcDNA3 vector.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Lipofectamine transfection procedures\nNote: SypH, a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein, disperses on the interior of the vesicle membrane (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). pH values in the vesicle lumen and extracellular environment are 5.5 and 7.2, respectively. Vesicle exocytosis induces de-acidification of the vesicle lumen, wherein pH increases from 5.5 to 7.2, which activates the SypH to produce the fluorescence. After vesicle endocytosis, the vesicular lumen is re-acidified as H+ is pumped into the vesicle lumen, and pH decreases from 7.2 to 5.5, which quenches the SypH. Thus, changes in the fluorescence of SypH reflect exocytosis and endocytosis at high temporal resolution (Zhu, et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).",
    "Make Medium A. For each well, mix 150 μL of Opti-MEM medium, 4 μL of Lipofectamine PLUS reagent, and 2 μg of SypH plasmid DNA in a 15-mL tube (For double transfection, such as SypH and Cre-mCherry, add 1.5 μg for each plasmid).\nMake Medium B. For each well, mix 150 μL of Opti-MEM medium and 4 μL of Lipofectamine LTX reagent in a 15-mL tube.\nIncubate Medium A and B at RT for 5 min; mix them to make plasmid medium. Incubate the plasmid medium at RT for 15–20 min in the tissue culture hood.\nTransfer 1 mL/well medium from the plate containing coverslip-plated neurons (Plate #1) to the corresponding wells of a new plate (Plate #2).\nAdd 1 mL/well fresh Feeding Medium to Plate #1 and Plate #2, respectively. Each well of Plate #1 and Plate #2 will contain 2 mL medium (1 mL old medium and 1 mL fresh medium).\nAdd 300 μL/well plasmid medium to Plate #1. Incubate the plate in the 37°C incubator for 40 min.\nUsing flame-sterilized forceps, gently transfer the coverslips from Plate #1 to the corresponding wells of Plate #2. Incubate Plate #2 in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: The expression level of SypH in neurons can be checked under the fluorescent microscope.\nAt DIV13-15, neurons are mature and ready for imaging experiments. Typically, there are 5–20 SypH (+) neurons on a 25-mm coverslip, 2–5 SypH (+) neurons within imaging chamber.",
    "Note: At DIV0, about 6 × 105 cells were added to each well of a 6-well plate (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3G). During two weeks of culture, the total number of cells attached on coverslip decreases significantly, due to natural death, cell losing attachment, medium changing, and transfection. At DIV14, only 200–500 living neurons attach on a 25-mm coverslip (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E and 3H).\nPart II. Acquisition and analysis of epifluorescence imaging\nStudy endocytosis at live individual boutons by monitoring changes in fluorescent signal under a microscope and recording with a camera. In our study, we used the Nikon Eclipse Ti-E microscope and the Andor camera (iXon X3 897 EMCCD).\nSetup and setting\nTiming: 20 min\nChoose microscope settings.\nSet the filters for detecting the SypH signal (excitation maximum at 475 nm; emission maximum at 509 nm).\nSelect an oil objective (60 ×, 1.4 NA). Add a drop of immersion oil (Nikon, Type F).\nConfigure the software (NIS-Elements AR 5.20.02).\nSet the exposure time as 100 ms, exposure frequency as 10 Hz.\nSet the gain of A/D converter as 1, pixel readout rate as 10 MHz, pixel depth as 14-bit, no pixels binning for capture, and pixels binning 2 × 2 for “Live” window.\nSet time-lapse imaging: 3 min recording with continuous capture, which will cover fluorescence activities in the resting condition before stimulation (0–30 s), during the stimulation (30–40 s), and in the following recovery after stimulation (40–180 s) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nSimultaneously export a trigger signal to the stimulator when the acquisition starts.",
    "Choose stimulation settings. Exocytosis and endocytosis can be induced by field stimulation. For example, a 20-mA train stimulation (200 1-ms pulse at 20 Hz) is generated from a stimulator (Model 2100, A-M Systems) and delivered to platinum electrodes in the imaging chamber through the stimulus isolation unit (Model SIU-102, Warner).\nNote: 1) Explanation for 20 mA train stimulation (200 1-ms pulse at 20 Hz), 20 mA: current strength of pulses; 200: the number of pulses in a train stimulation; 1-ms pulse: each pulse with 1 ms duration; 20 Hz: 20 pulses per second or 50 ms interval between two adjacent pulses. The train stimulation can trigger the release of vesicles, including vesicles in the readily releasable pool and replenished vesicles from the recycling pool, in boutons of hippocampal neurons. 2) The strength of pulses can be altered by adjusting the current output from the stimulus isolation unit. The number of pulses in the train stimulation, single pulse width, and frequency can be modified by adjusting the train width, the pulse duration, and the pulse interval of the stimulator, respectively. 3) Usually, there is a 30 s delay between trigger signal and train stimulation for baseline recording.\nPosition the coverslip on the stage of the microscope\nTiming: 5 min\nAssembly of the coverslip-chamber unit.\nThe coverslip-chamber unit includes four parts, including a clamp, imaging chamber, coverslip, and platform (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Preparation of the coverslip-chamber unit\n(A) Bottom view of the imaging chamber. Two parallel platinum electrodes are used for field stimulation. The bath volume is 260 μL. Smear the grease on the bottom of the chamber.\n(B) Smear the grease on the top of the platform.\n(C) Mount a coverslip (colored with red to recognize it easily) on the top of the platform.",
    "(D) Put the chamber on the coverslip, with the bottom of the chamber with the grease facing the coverslip. The coverslip forms the floor of the chamber.\n(E) Put a clamp on the top of the chamber and tighten the screws to fix the chamber on the platform.\n(F) Coverslip-chamber unit was built. Add 250 μL of Saline Solution to bath.\nSmear high-vacuum silicone grease (Sigma) on the bottom of the chamber (RC-21BRFS, Warner) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) and the top of the platform (Model P2/PH2, Warner) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) with a #4 painting brush to seal the gaps between the chamber, coverslip, and platform.\nUsing fine forceps to mount a coverslip with plated neurons on the top of the platform (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) and cover it with the chamber (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D). Gently press on the chamber to ensure a tight seal.\nCritical: Keep 100–200 μL of Feeding Medium on the coverslip to prevent the glass from drying.\nAdd a clamp to the top of the chamber and tighten the 4 screws with a screwdriver to fix the chamber in place on the platform (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nAdd 250 μL of Saline Solution to the chamber (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F). Dry the bottom side of coverslip with kimwipes. During imaging experiments (30–45 min), it is unnecessary to perfuse the cells.\nEnsure no leakage, then position, and fix the coverslip-chamber unit on the stage of the microscope. Connect the chamber to the output wires from the stimulus isolation unit for field stimulation.\nCritical: If the Saline Solution is leaking from the gap between the chamber and coverslip, it will mix with the immersion oil under the coverslip. The mixture of leaked Saline Solution and immersion oil will result in changes in the refractive index that cause lack of focus during recording.\nCollection of imaging data\nTiming: 45 min",
    "In general, data in an independent experiment are generated by the first round of stimulation on each coverslip.\nTurn off the room lighting and keep the acquisition window in a dark scheme to reduce ambient light.\nDetect the SypH (+) neurons.\nUnder the simple white field, focus the sample by ocular observation.\nUnder the epifluorescent light (Intensilight, C-HGFI; power set as 100% illumination), look for SypH (+) neurons and branches by ocular observation as soon as possible.\nReduce the epifluorescence light to 12.5% illumination, switch light path to camera, observe SypH (+) neurons and branches on active “Live” window.\nCritical: In resting condition, if the fluorescent signals in the boutons are round or oval and those of branches are dim, blurry, and continuous, the neuron is a good candidate for the experiment; if they are bright, sharp, and discontinuous, the neuron may be sick or already dead, and you should not use it. Change to another coverslip if SypH (+) neurons cannot be found.\nSwitch off epifluorescence light temporarily and mark 20–50 expected boutons, visualized by dim fluorescence puncta, with 2 μm × 2 μm square markers on inactive “Live” window. Marking takes several minutes. Boutons will be identified by the increase of fluorescence intensity induced by stimulation.\nCritical: Dimming of fluorescent signals may be caused by 1) bleaching induced by intensive stimulation and long exposure to the epifluorescence light; 2) unhealthy cells collected from the knock-out mice. To avoid this issue, data generated only by the first round of stimulation will be considered for analysis. After that, the corresponding coverslip with cultured neurons will be discarded.\nData acquisition.\nSwitch on the epifluorescent light, double-check the focus by observing the active “Live” window and start an acquisition.",
    "Based on changes in the fluorescent signals shown on the window (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C), identify which square markers represent the boutons and observe if endocytosis rate is affected or not.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Fluorescence images\n(A) Diagram of SypH tracking exocytosis and endocytosis. 1: In resting condition, SypH is quenched by low pH (pHvesicle = 5.5) in the vesicle (see Figure 6B, left). 2: When the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, pHvesicle increases to 7.2 because the protons move out of the vesicle, which activates SypH to produce the fluorescence (see Figure 6B, center). 3: Vesicle endocytosis. 4: After endocytosis, vesicles are re-acidified, which quenches SypH again (see Figure 6B, right). Therefore, exocytosis and endocytosis can be tracked in real-time by monitoring changes in SypH signals (see Figure 6C).\n(B) Snapshots at 10 s (left), 40 s (center) and 170 s (right) in a 180-s imaging video. ROI squares (2 μm × 2 μm) marked with different colors represent five boutons, which were visualized by dim fluorescence puncta. The intensity of the fluorescence signal reached its maximum at 40 s (center) at the end of a 10-s train stimulation (200 1-ms pulse at 20 Hz). Scale bar (10 μm) applies to all photos in panel B.\n(C) In Time Measurement window, fluorescence intensity traces were collected from 5 corresponding ROIs in (B). Their baselines, from 0 to 30 s, have different intensity levels. During a train stimulation (200 1-ms pulse at 20 Hz), from 30 s to 40 s, the intensity of signals increases, representing the net outcome of exocytosis and endocytosis. After 40 s, signals decay slowly, reflecting endocytosis.\n(D) The mean trace is averaged from the 5 traces shown in panel (C).",
    "Critical: If boutons have not responses to stimulation, check the system to make sure the stimulation is indeed delivered from the stimulator to the imaging chamber. Otherwise, try another coverslip.\nSave an acquisition.\nQuantitative analyses of epifluorescent data\nTiming: 1–2 h per experiment\nIn our studies, the Nikon analysis software (NIS-Elements AR Analysis) was used for offline analysis. Free software, such as ImageJ, can also be used in analysis.\nIdentify and mark the boutons with square markers (2 μm × 2 μm region of interest (ROI)) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). Ensure each ROI large enough to cover the largest changes in fluorescence induced by vesicle fusion and fission, which will rule out the artifacts induced by movement of SypH along the plasma membrane.\nBecause the boutons of a neuron have different responses to the same stimulation, more than 20 boutons in one field of view will be randomly selected for data analysis per experiment.",
    "Critical: 1) In most cases, one field of view usually contains enough boutons (>20) for analysis. If not, simply exclude those recordings. For unhealthy cells from the KO mice, it is less probable that 20 boutons will be visible in one field of view. This problem will be solved by increasing the density of cells during plating or try more cultures. It is not recommended to collect data generated by multiple rounds of stimulation in different fields of view in an experiment. 2) The stimulation, exposure time, and intensity of epifluorescent light used in our previous studies did not cause significant bleaching. Similar fluorescent responses can be induced by 3–5 rounds of train stimulation at WT neurons. If bleaching happens, affected boutons are not considered in analysis. 3) Low expression of fluorescence will make boutons have small responses to stimulation. Increasing the amount of plasmid or using different carriers in transfection will improve the expression of SypH in cultured neurons.\nTo estimate background fluorescence in the region without cells, select an area around a marked bouton and mark it with the square maker (2 μm × 2 μm). Because boutons are visualized by puncta with different intensities of fluorescence, about 20 background areas are selected per experiment, each marked bouton having its own marked background.\nExport the averaged data of bouton and background signals (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D) to Excel.\nTo compare data from different experiments, the fluorescence change (ΔF) of boutons is normalized in Excel using the following formula:\n  Normalized   ΔF   ( % )  =    F max  −   F baseline     F baseline  −  F background    × 100  \nNote: Fmax and Fbaseline refer to maximal fluorescent increase after stimulation and baseline fluorescence before stimulation, respectively, and Fbackground refers to background fluorescence.",
    "In each experimental condition, about 10 independent experiments from 3 cultures should be conducted to minimize the effects of random variation on the data.\nUse the endocytosis initial rate (Ratedecay), the amount of fluorescence decay during the first 4–10 s after stimulation (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A), to measure the rate of endocytosis quantitatively in hippocampal synapses in different experimental conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Analysis of endocytosis rate\n(A) In Igor software, a sampled trace shows how the initial rate of endocytosis (Ratedecay) was calculated. Exocytosis and endocytosis were induced by a train stimulation (black bar, 200 1-ms pulse at 20 Hz). The same stimulation also applies to (B and C).\n(B and C) Fluorescence response (mean + SEM) induced by stimulation in WT (B, n=17) and Kv3.3 KO (C, n=15) boutons at 34–37°C. Kv3.3: a voltage-dependent potassium channel.\n(D) Summary of Ratedecay (mean + SEM) collected from B and C. ∗∗: p < 0.01; t test (compared to WT). Note: Data in Figure B‒D indicate that Kv3.3 enhances the vesicle endocytosis in hippocampal synapses. Data in Figure B‒D have been modified from Wu et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18].\nCritical: In control condition, endocytosis decay can be fit with a single exponential function and measured quantitatively with a time constant (τ). When endocytosis is inhibited, fluorescence decay slows down; the fluorescent signals usually do not return to baseline in each time window. Therefore, τ will not be used in this study of endocytosis because the value of τ is difficult to determine when endocytosis is inhibited.\nIn Igor software, Ratedecay is calculated by the following formula:\n   Rate decay    (  % / s  )  =   ΔF   ( % )    4  s − 10  s   after   stimulation",
    "Note: ΔF refers to the change in fluorescence density within 4–10 s after stimulation (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A). A smaller Ratedecay represents slower endocytosis.\nDetermine if mutation affects endocytosis by comparing the value of Ratedecay of the control group with that of the mutation group. Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B–7D shows a real case.\nPart III. EM acquisition and analysis\nEndocytosis is studied by observing the formation of individual vesicles and endosomes from the plasma membrane under an electron microscope. A typical experimental design includes four preconditions before a fixative is added (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A): 1) resting condition without 90 mM K+ stimulation; 2) no recovery condition with 90 mM K+ stimulation for 1.5 min only; 3) short recovery condition with 90 mM K+ stimulation for 1.5 min and 3 min recovery after KCl washout; 4) long recovery condition with 90 mM K+ stimulation for 1.5 min and 10 min recovery after KCl washout. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is applied for 1.5 min during the application of 90 mM K+ solution to label endocytosed vesicles. In resting condition, HRP is also added for 1.5 min before fixation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

    "Add 300 μL of filtered poly-L-lysine solution to each well of the 24-well plate.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 2 h.\nAspirate the poly-L-lysine solution.\nWash the plate 3 times with sterilized water for 10 min each.\nAir dry for 30 min in the tissue culture hood, store in the 37°C incubator, and start the dissection.\nHippocampal harvest, digestion and dissociation is the same as the protocol described in steps 1–29.\nAdd 0.5 mL of the cell suspension (4.0 × 105 cells/mL) to each well of a 24-well plate and store in the 5% CO2, 37°C incubator.\nFor wild-type and conventional knockout mice, the cultured neurons do not need any transfection at DIV7. At DIV14, neurons are mature and ready for EM experiments.\nCritical: For conditional knockout mice, it is necessary to transfect the Cre gene into hippocampal neurons at DIV7 to remove LoxP-flanked gene(s). However, the transfection rate is only ∼5% when Lipofectamine is used as a carrier for transfection of the Cre gene. To increase transfection efficiency, adeno-associated virus (AAV) can be used as a plasmid carrier to transfect the Cre gene into cells at DIV7. The transfection efficiency will be more than 95% at DIV14, which is extremely helpful for EM experiments.\nStimulation, staining, and primary fixation\nTiming: 2 days\nPrepare HRP (5 mg/mL) Saline Solution and HRP (5 mg/mL) 90 mM KCl Solution.",
    "Note: HRP is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of various substrates, such as 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB), using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Oxidized DAB is an insoluble product with a brown color. DAB and H2O2 can enter the cytosol by penetrating the plasma membrane, but HRP cannot. HRP enters the cytosol only by vesicle endocytosis. Therefore, oxidation of DAB happens only in HRP (+) vesicles. Thus, HRP can be used to track endocytosed vesicles in imaging experiments (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nDilute glutaraldehyde from 70% to 4% and 2% by adding 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4).\nCritical: 70% glutaraldehyde is toxic and sticky. Wear a lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles; stir the glutaraldehyde solution in a fume hood while diluting.\nAt DIV14, transfer all culture medium in the 24-well plate containing the plated neurons (Plate #1) to the corresponding wells of a new 24-well plate (Plate #2).\nCritical: Care must be taken to avoid drying of the neurons.\nExperiment for the resting condition (condition 1) (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A).\nAdd 300 μL of the HRP Saline Solution to each well of Plate #1 for 1.5 min at RT. The HRP (+) vesicles in this condition will be rare because the frequency of spontaneous endocytosis is extremely low.\nAspirate the HRP Saline Solution and wash the cells with 500 μL of the PBS.\nAspirate the PBS and add 500 μL of 4% glutaraldehyde to fix the cells.\nCritical: For a 24-well plate, we divide the wells with plated cells into 4 groups, which correspond to the four preconditions in EM experiments. Each group includes 3–4 wells.\nExperiments for other three high KCl stimulation conditions.",
    "Add 300 μL of the HRP 90 mM KCl Solution to each well of Plate #1 for 1.5 min at RT, to depolarize all neurons in the wells. Uptake of HRP into the vesicles will catalyze oxidation of DAB by H2O2 in endocytosed vesicles as explained in step 62.\nAspirate the HRP 90 mM KCl Solution and wash the cells with 500 μL of the PBS once to stop depolarization of the neurons completely.\nAfter aspirating the PBS,\nCondition 2: Add 500 μL of 4% glutaraldehyde to fix cells immediately after the PBS is removed. There is a 5–10 s interval between stimulation and fixation.\nCondition 3 and 4: Transfer the culture medium back from the wells of Plate #2 to the corresponding wells of Plate #1 for a 3 min recovery (condition 3) or 10 min recovery (condition 4); replace the culture medium in the wells of Plate #1 with 500 μL of 4% glutaraldehyde to fix the cells.\nAll fixations last 2 h at RT in the fume hood.\nNote: Glutaraldehyde is used to fix the samples, so that structures can be preserved for EM observation. Fixation kills the cells. EM images are snapshots of living samples before fixation.\nWash with 500 μL of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer 3 times and store the plate at 4°C overnight (12 h).\nAllow the plate to equilibrate to RT.\nStain the fixed cells with 500 μL of the DAB Solution at 37°C for 30 min (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B).\nNote: DAB will be oxidized in HRP (+) vesicles. Oxidized DAB forms brown precipitate, which can be detected by EM.\nWash the fixed cells 3 times with 500 μL of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 7 min each.\nAspirate the sodium cacodylate buffer and add 500 μL of 2% glutaraldehyde.",
    "Temporarily store at 4°C before post-fixation.\nEM sample processing and thin section preparation\nTiming: 5 days\nPreparation of thin sections containing boutons is critical in the EM experiment. Given the difficulty of this step, experience will help immensely to accelerate it. In the present study, this step was performed by researchers in the dedicated EM facility at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).\nRemove 2% glutaraldehyde, wash with 500 μL of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer 3 times for 7 min each.\nIncubate the fixed cells in 1% OsO4 (in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer) on ice for 1 h, covered with foil. OsO4 will contrast the image.\nCritical: OsO4 is acutely toxic. Wear a lab coat, protective goggles, and gloves; keep the sample in the chemical fume hood.\nWash the samples three times with 500 μL of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer on ice for 7 min each.\nUranyl acetate staining.\nWash the samples 3 times with 500 μL of 0.1 N sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 7 min each.\nIncubate the samples with 500 μL of 0.25% uranyl acetate (UA, in 0.1 N sodium acetate buffer) for 1 h at 4°C. The samples are covered with foil, which keeps them in the dark to avoid UA precipitation.\nWash the samples 3 times with 500 μL of 0.1 N sodium acetate buffer for 7 min each. Uranyl acetate staining will increase image contrast.\nDehydration.\nDehydrate the samples with 500 μL of 50%, 70%, and 90% ethanol in a fume hood for 7 min each.\nWash the samples 3 times with 500 μL of 100% ethanol for 7 min each.\nCritical: Replace the water content in the samples with ethanol to allow resin infiltration, as resins are hydrophobic.\nResin embedding.",
    "Incubate the samples with 500 μL of 1:1 epoxy resin/(100%) ethanol on a rocker plate for 30 min at RT.\nNote: 1) Epoxy resin penetrates the cell and occupies all the space in the cell. 2) Some labs prefer to use acetone as a transition solvent instead of ethanol.\nIncubate the samples with 500 μL of 2:1 epoxy resin/ethanol on a rocker plate for 30 min at RT.\nIncubate the samples with 500 μL epoxy resin in a 50°C oven for 10 min.\nExchange epoxy mixture with fresh 100% epoxy resin and incubate at 50°C for 1 h. Repeat it one more time.\nPolymerization. Add 500 μL of fresh epoxy resin and allow to harden in a 50°C oven overnight (12 h) and then in a 60°C oven for another 48 h.\nNote: After polymerization, the sample is hard enough to bear the pressure of sectioning.\nCarefully select a region of interest (ROI), an area with plenty of neurites, under an inverted light microscope (Figures 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A–9C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Determination of the regions of interest (ROIs) and preparation of the thin sections\n(A) The cells (grey spots) embedded in the resin are viewed under an inverted light microscope (10×).

This kind of area may yield fewer synapses. Scale bar: 100 μm.\n(D) Serial thin sections were cut by the ultramicrotome (Leica Ultracut S).",
    "Saw out the selected ROI and surrounding area (about 4 mm × 8 mm) with a jeweler’s saw. Remove sawed-out sample from plastic bottom of plate using a pair of pliers.\nPlace the sample on a chuck holder in an ultramicrotome (Leica Ultracut S), where it is manually trimmed to a trapezoid shape, with less than ∼0.5 mm wide and ∼1 mm long on the face side; the sample is sectioned extremely thinly (∼70 nm thick) using a diamond knife (its edge is parallel to the surface of the block) (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]D). The sections are then collected on individual grids (400 mesh copper grid) and air dried overnight (12 h).\nCritical: Total of 5 copper grids are collected every ∼5 sections, such as the 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th and 21st sections, to encompass neurite depth at different levels. Other sections are discarded.\nStain with 3% lead citrate for 5 min to enhance the contrast of the sections.\nWash the grids with ddH2O for 10–12 s, wick dry them with filter paper, then air dry. The stained sections on the grids are now ready for examination under the electron microscope.\nThe whole workflow (steps 62–85) for preparing the EM sample is shown in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

    "Critical: Two landmarks are helpful for identifying the synaptic boutons, 1) the electron dense thickening of the postsynaptic plasma membrane (the post synaptic density (PSD)), and 2) uniform sized synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal opposed to the PSD.\nSet exposure time as 60 ms, pixel binning as 4 × 4, gain of the A/D converter as 2, image average value as 2.\nCollect the digital images of the synaptic boutons from different sections. It is better to have a clear presynaptic and postsynaptic structure in the photo. Vesicles in the presynaptic part have a round shape and clear membrane structure (Figures 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11] and 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1788-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11.

For R, HRP was applied for 1.5 min before fixation; for other three conditions, HRP and KCl were co-applied for 1.5 min. Scale bar (200 nm) applies to all photos in panel A.",
    "(B and C) The number of HRP(+) vesicles (B) and bulk endosome area (C) per bouton (μm2) is plotted versus the time before (R) and at 0 (K+), 3, and 10 min after the end of KCl application in control (black bars) and β-actin KO (red bars) hippocampal cultures (mean + SEM; each group was from 40–100 synaptic profiles). ∗∗∗p < 0.001; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗p < 0.05 (ANOVA). Note: These results suggest that β-actin enhanced both vesicle endocytosis and bulk endocytosis in hippocampal neurons. Data in Figure 12 have been modified from Wu et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17].\nCritical: Image 30–50 boutons in a sample from one culture; data in each experimental condition are collected from at least 3 cultures.\nQuantification and statistical analysis of EM data\nTiming: 5–20 min per image\nUse ImageJ, a free software, to analyze the EM images (Schindelin, et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nLocate the synaptic structure, which includes the presynaptic bouton, synaptic cleft, and PSD (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). Boutons contain synaptic vesicles (diameter (d) 40 nm) and endosomes (d > 80 nm).\nCritical: 1) Bulk endocytosis, a large piece of membrane invagination after strong stimulation, generates endosomes, which gradually disappear as they are used to regenerate synaptic vesicles. 2) In resting condition, HRP (+) vesicles and endosomes are rare. 3) After stimulation, HRP (+) synaptic vesicles and endosomes increase, which suggests that vesicle endocytosis and bulk endocytosis occurred.\nTo study endocytosis, measure the areas of boutons and HRP (+) bulk endosomes, and count the number of HRP (+) vesicles (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).",
    "Critical: 1) Bouton size varies in different ultrathin sections. Using area of bouton normalizes the data to rule out the effects of bouton size on the results. 2) Both area and number of endosomes can reflect the bulk endocytosis. Our statistics indicate that the results based on the area were similar to those based on the number. In our studies, we measured the area of endosomes as it had a smaller variance.\nCalculate the number of HRP (+) vesicles per bouton (μm2) and the HRP (+) bulk endosome area per bouton (μm2) (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]).\nNote: Data in each group, such as the wild-type group, will be collected from 90–150 boutons in each of the four preconditions.\nThrough analysis of the data, the speed of vesicle endocytosis and bulk endocytosis can be estimated. For example, in the same condition, if the number of HRP (+) vesicles per bouton (μm2) obtained from the mutated cells after application of high K+ is less than the value obtained from wild-type, vesicle endocytosis may be inhibited by mutants. Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12] shows a real case.\nNote: To confirm changes in endocytosis induced by mutants, additional experiments are necessary, such as the rescue experiment."
