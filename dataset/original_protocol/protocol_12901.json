    "1. Preparation of Solutions\nPrepare the following solutions fresh for each experiment.\nFor the fixation solution, prepare 37% formaldehyde and store it at RT. Dilute it in 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to a final concentration of 1.42%.\n\t\tCAUTION: Formaldehyde is classified as irritant, corrosive, mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic. Do not ingest. Do not breathe gas/fumes/vapor/spray. In case of insufficient ventilation, wear suitable respiratory equipment. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Keep away from incompatibles, such as oxidizing agents, reducing agents, acids, alkalis, and moisture.\nFor the glycine stop-fix solution, prepare 0.125 M glycine in 1x PBS solution and store it at RT.\nFor the cell scraping solution, prepare a 1x PBS solution in dH2O and store it on ice. Directly before use, add proteinase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM.\n\t\tCAUTION: PMSF is classified as corrosive and toxic; wear protective clothing and use it in a ventilated area.\nDirectly before using the cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, and 0.5% NP40), add 1X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC; 100X stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): 104 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 80 µM aprotinin, 4 mM bestatin, 1.4 mM E-64, 2 mM leupeptin, and 1.5 mM pepstatin A) and 0.5 mM PMSF.\nDirectly before using the nuclei lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl; pH 8.0, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 1% SDS), add 1X PIC and 0.5 mM PMSF.\n2. Cell Fixation and Shearing\nGrow the cells to 70-80% confluence on 10 cm tissue culture plates. Stimulate the cells per the experimental aims.\nRemove the tissue culture medium, add 5 mL of fixation solution, and incubate the cells for 10 min at RT on a shaking platform.",
    "Remove the fixation solution and wash the cells twice with 10 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS.\nRemove the 1x PBS, add 5 mL of glycine stop-fix solution, and incubate the cells for 5 min at RT on a shaking platform.\nRemove the glycine stop-fix solution and wash the cells twice with 10 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS.\nRemove the 1x PBS, add 2 mL of cell scraping solution, and harvest the cells using a cell scraper. Transfer the harvested cells to a conical tube on ice.\nCentrifuge the samples for 10 min at 600 x g and 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 1X cell lysis buffer, and incubate on ice for 30 min. Alternatively, snap-freeze the pellet in liquid nitrogen and store it at -80 °C.\nOnce the pellet is resuspended in the cell lysis buffer, transfer the cell suspension to an ice-cold dounce homogenizer and dounce for 10 strokes using a type-B pestle for cell disruption.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge the samples for 10 min at 2,400 x g and 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 350 µL of nuclei digestion buffer, and incubate the samples for 5 min at 37 °C.\nAdd micrococcal nuclease (1 U/µL) and mix by vortexing. Incubate the samples at 37 °C for 5-20 min; mix the samples every 2 min by inversion.\n\tNOTE: The time and enzyme concentration differ between cell lines and might require optimization in cases of suboptimal enzymatic shearing.\nAlternatively, achieve chromatin shearing by sonication using commercially available sonicators.\n\tNOTE: Sonication conditions will require optimization. An optimization example protocol is provided below using a sample volume of 300 µL and a sample processing power of 25%.",
    "Following step 2.10, discard the supernatant and resuspend the nuclear pellet in 1.0 mL of commercial shearing buffer.\nAliquot 300 µL of the resuspended nuclear pellet into three 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Place them on ice.\nShear the 3 aliquots of fixed chromatin at 25% power using 3 different conditions to determine the optimal sonication conditions:\n\t\t5 pulses of 20 s each, with a 30 s rest on ice between each pulse.\n\t\t10 pulses of 20 s each, with a 30 s rest on ice between each pulse.\n\t\t20 pulses of 20 s each, with a 30 s rest on ice between each pulse.\nContinue with Step 2.15, as outlined below.\nFollowing the incubation with the micrococcal nuclease, add 7 µL of ice-cold 0.5 M EDTA to stop the reaction.\nCentrifuge the samples with the sheared DNA for 10 min at 16,200 x g and 4 °C.\nTransfer the sheared DNA-containing supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. Aliquot 50 µL into a separate microcentrifuge tube to confirm the successful shearing of the DNA (section 3). Use the remaining volume immediately for immunoprecipitation (section 4) or store it at -80 °C.\n3. Confirmation of the Shearing Efficiency\nAdd 150 µL of nuclease-free dH2O and 10 µL of 5 M NaCl to the 50 µL aliquot of the sheared chromatin from step 2.16.\nIncubate the samples at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the crosslinks.\nAdd 2 µL of RNase A (10 µg/µL) and incubate the samples at 37 °C for 15 min.\nAdd 10 µL of proteinase K (0.5 µg/µL) and incubate the samples at 42 °C for 90 min.\nFor purification of the DNA, perform a phenol/chloroform extraction12.",
    "Add nuclease-free water to a final volume of 200 µL. Add 200 µL of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to the sample and vortex for 20 s.\nCentrifuge at room temperature for 5 min at 16,000 x g. Carefully remove the upper aqueous phase and transfer it to a fresh tube. Be sure not to carry over any phenol during the pipetting.\nAdd 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate (NH4OAc), pH 5.2, and mix by flicking the tube several times with a finger. Add 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol and mix by vortexing for 5 s. Incubate the sample O/N at -20 °C, or for at least 1 h at -80 °C.\nCentrifuge the sample for 30 min at 4 °C and 16,000 x g to pellet the cDNA.\nCarefully remove the supernatant without disrupting the pellet. Add 1 mL of RT, 70% ethanol and invert the tube several times.\nCentrifuge the sample for 2 min at 4 °C and 16,000 x g. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nDry the pellet for 5-10 min at RT. Resuspend the pellet in 30 µL of dH2O.\nUse a 5 and 10 µL aliquot of the purified DNA for gel electrophoresis with a 1% TAE agarose gel.\n\tNOTE: Successful chromatin shearing results in a 200-1,500 bp DNA pattern. If the shearing is unsuccessful, determine the optimal shearing conditions for the specific cells by modifying the incubation time of the shearing step (step 2.12) to 5, 10, and 15 min.\nUse the remaining sample to analyze the DNA concentration of the sample. Reverse-calculate the DNA concentration in the sheared chromatin sample (step 2.16); use the same DNA amounts for each treatment group for the immunoprecipitation (section 4).\n4. Immunoprecipitation",
    "Combine 10-25 µg of the sheared, crosslinked chromatin (step 2.16) with 25 µL of ChIP-grade protein G magnetic beads, 10 µL of immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (stock solution: 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.0, 1.2 mM EDTA, and 167 mM NaCl), and 1 µL of PIC.\nAfter 4 h of incubation, add 1-10 µg of antibody (the antibody concentration will vary based upon the affinity of the antibody; it should initially be used per manufacturer recommendations and experimentally optimized if necessary) to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and add dH2O to a final volume of 100 µL.\n\tNOTE: Instead of the above-described direct immunoprecipitation method, the indirect immunoprecipiation method can be used by first combining the chromatin with the antibodies and subsequently adding protein G magnetic beads.\nIncubate the samples on an end-to-end rotator for 4-12 h at 4 °C.\n5. Elution\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic stand. Once the magnetic beads aggregate on the side of the tube, carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\nWash the beads three times with 800 µL of wash buffer 1 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA pH 8, 20 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8, and 150 mM NaCl); mix by inverting the tube several times. Place the tube on the magnetic stand and carefully remove and discard the wash buffer once the magnetic beads aggregate on the side of the tube.\nWash the beads once with 800 µL of wash buffer 2 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA; pH 8, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, and 500 mM NaCl); mix by inverting the tube several times. Place the tube on the magnetic stand and carefully remove and discard the wash buffer once the magnetic beads aggregate on the side of the tube.",
    "Resuspend the beads in 50 µL of elution buffer (1% SDS and 100 mM NaHCO3) and incubate the samples on an end-to-end rotator for 15 min at RT.\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic stand, and once the magnetic beads collect at the side of the tube, transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube.\nAdd 6 µL of 5 M NaCl, to reverse the crosslinking, and 2 µL of proteinase K (0.5 µg/µL). After mixing the samples, incubate the samples for 2 h at 65 °C.\nFor purification of the DNA, perform a phenol/chloroform extraction12 (step 3.5) and subsequently resuspend the pellet in 30 µL of dH2O.\n\tNOTE: The samples can be directly analyzed for protein binding sites (section 5) or can be stored at -20 °C.\n6. Binding-site Analysis\nPerform an analysis for specific binding sites within a known nucleic acid sequence using PCR or qRT-PCR. For primer design, follow conventional PCR or qRT-PCR protocols. Design the primers to synthesize a 150-400 bp amplicon that bridges the protein binding site of interest (Figure 1).\nSet up the PCR using four different DNA templates to assure specificity: i) DNA from ChIP immunoprecipitated with the antibody of interest, ii) DNA from ChIP immunoprecipitated with an unspecific IgG antibody, iii) input DNA, and iv) H2O as a negative control for the PCR to rule out contamination. In the case of pathway stimulation, choose a fifth template using a different set of primers specific to a known binding site of the immunoprecipitated protein.\n\tNOTE: In the case of the c-KIT ligand promoter analysis, use conventional PCR to demonstrate TGF-β-induced SMAD binding at the SBE within the c-KIT ligand promoter region. As a positive control, perform PCR on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as a known target of TGF-β-induced SMAD binding.",
