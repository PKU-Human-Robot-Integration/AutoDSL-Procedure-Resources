    "Construction of cuff electrode (Figure 3A) (~2 days)On day 1, cut two 12 inch lengths of Cooner wire. Strip off 6 mm of insulation from the tips of the Cooner wires. Cut one 0.5 inch length of Silastic tubing. Cut a slit longitudinally through the tubing.Thread the Cooner wires through the walls of the tube. Wrap the tip of the wire around itself to form a knot. The two exposed wires should be approximately 2 mm apart on the internal portion of the Silastic tubing. For any portion of wire that is exposed (not insulated) on the external portion of the Silastic tube, coat with flexible silicone and allow it to dry overnight.On day 2, trim the Silastic tubing so that the entire length of the cuff is ~1 cm.Construction of fine wire electrodes (Figure 3B) (~30 min per electrode)Cut two 12 inch lengths of 0.002 mm fine wire. Thread the two lengths of fine wire through a sterile 25 G needle. With a scalpel, gently scrape away the green insulation from the tips of the fine wire so that ~1.5 mm of wire is exposed as the electrode. Fold the de-insulated wires to form “hooks” at the needle tip. Stagger the tips so that the de-insulated portions of the two wires are not in contact with each other.On the distal length of the fine wires, gently scrape away ~1 cm of the green insulation. This end will connect to the pre-amplifier. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617044705_8779.jpgFigure 3. Recording and stimulating electrodes. A.

    "Optical activation of neurons with axons in the sciatic nerveSterilize instruments in hot beads (~250 °C for 2-3 s).Anesthetize mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine cocktail (Ketamine HCl, 80 mg/kg [McKesson, Memphis, TN, USA]; Xylazine, 10 mg/kg [AnaSed Injection, LLOYD Laboratories, Quezon City, Philippines]). The injections volume typically ranges from 0.1cc to 0.25cc based on mouse weight.Clip fur from the entire hindlimb.Clean the surgical site with betadine and ethanol three times.Make a 1-inch skin incision in the skin over the posterior thigh to expose the hamstring muscles overlying the sciatic nerve. Gently blunt dissect the hamstring muscles apart in the fascial plane to expose the sciatic nerve.Insert the fine wire needle electrode into the gastrocnemius muscle (Figures 4A and 4B). Place the electrode in a common location in each animal (the muscle will atrophy significantly after nerve injury).Place the cuff around the sciatic nerve (Figure 4B) and gently hold the tubing closed with a suture.Position the fiber optic cable so that the tip is gently contacting the sciatic nerve Figure 4A. Use a clamp to hold the cable in place. Take care that the clamp does not break the fiber optic. Optional: A specific branch of the sciatic nerve can be selectively stimulated by dissecting the epineurium to separate the tibial and common fibular nerves (Figure 4C).  Stimulate the nerve with a 0.1 ms electrical pulse at ~5 v applied through the cuff electrode. A visible muscle twitch (and M response resulting from direct motor axon stimulation) should accompany the pulse. If a muscle twitch occurs but no evoked EMG response can be recorded, check all connections.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617044731_5158.jpgFigure 4.

    "The cuff electrode is placed around the sciatic nerve. In A and B, observe that the green fine wire electrode is transcutaneously inserted into the lateral gastrocnemius muscle. C. Branches of the sciatic nerve were gently separated by removing the epineurium with fine forceps. The white asterisk indicates the larger tibial nerve branch, and the smaller common peroneal (fibular) and sural nerves can be seen above and below it, respectively. The black asterisk indicates a small branch of the sciatic nerve that innervates a portion of the hamstring muscle.Stimulate the nerve with a 5 ms pulse of light delivered through the optical fiber at maximal light intensity (see Note 1 regarding light output). A muscle twitch (and direct M response) should accompany the pulse (if using a mouse that expresses ChR2 in motoneurons, e.g., Thy1ChR2 or Chat:ChR2). Record potentials from the muscle and nerve in response to light stimulation. Stimuli should be delivered no more often than once every three seconds to minimize any muscle fatigue.Note: If recording from the nerve, action potentials will propagate in both directions along the nerve from the light source. In mice in which ChR2 expression is restricted to sensory neurons, e.g., the AvilCre:ChR2 mouse, no muscle twitch (or direct M response) should be present. Instead, potentials can only be recorded from the nerve cuff electrode as an electroneurogram (Figure 5A, right).  Stimulate both electrically and optically over a range of stimulus intensities, starting at the lowest intensity (voltage or light intensity) and incrementally increasing to determine a threshold (the voltage or light intensity) at which a response occurs with 50% of the stimulus trials and the maximal response (Vmax). For example, start at 0.1 V and increase stimulus strength by 0.1 V until Vmax is reached.",
    "Perform optical treatment at a light intensity greater than the intensity required to obtain a maximal M response. The most widely used treatment paradigm is supramaximal stimulation at 20 Hz for one hour.Perform nerve transection and repair.Nerve transection and repairCut a small (~3 mm x 3 mm) square of Silastic sheeting.With forceps, place the Silastic square under the nerve just proximal to the branch point of the sural nerve.Mix 2.5 μl of fibrinogen with 5 μl of thrombin and quickly pipette this glue mixture onto the nerve on the Silastic film.Allow the fibrin glue to dry.Gently probe the film with forceps to ensure that the nerve is secured to the Silastic film.With sharp spring scissors, transect the nerve where it is glued to the film and ensure that no fibers remain in continuity at the deepest part of the nerve.Apply more fibrin glue to the transected nerve.Post-operative recovery and monitoring Once all wounds have been closed with suture, animals should be placed in a clean recovery cage on an approved water bath-regulated heating pad so that half of the cage is heated and half is at ambient room temperature. Animals should be monitored every 15 min until fully recovered from anesthesia at which time they will be moved into their housing room. The non-absorbable skin sutures should be removed from the skin ~7-10 days. Loss of 25% of body weight from pre-operative body weight is considered evidence that the animal is debilitated, and a veterinary consult should be obtained regarding euthanasia."
