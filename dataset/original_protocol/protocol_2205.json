    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAn overview of the metabolite extraction is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Adherent cultured cells are detached from the culture dish by trypsinization and collected into a 15 mL tube. After centrifugation, cell pellets are lysed with methanol solution (steps 1–17). The crude lysate and cell debris mixture are treated for highly polar and charged metabolite analysis by CE-TOFMS (steps 18–60). The rest of the mix (200 μL in volume) is solubilized in chloroform to analyze hydrophobic metabolites by LC-QTOFMS (steps 61–89).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1814-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. CE-TOFMS and LC-QTOFMS analysis overview\nMetabolite extraction from adherent cultured cells\nTiming: 1 h\nThis section describes how to collect cells. For example, we describe the procedure for breast cancer cell line MCF-7.\nCulture cells until 80% confluent in a 10 cm dish.\nDiscard culture medium by aspiration.\nRinse the cells with pre-warmed PBS (-) once.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution per 10 cm dish.\nIncubate the dish at 37°C for approximately 5 min until the cells are detached from the culture dish.\nAdd 5 mL of PBS (-) supplemented with 10% FBS.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1814-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Discard the supernatant by aspiration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold extraction methanol solution with internal reference metabolites (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nSuspend cells by vortexing and store the sample tubes at −80°C until use (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nNote: The concentrations of metabolites are normalized to cell number at step 60. Thus, cell numbers should be counted for all samples at step 9.\nNote: In step 5, cells are examined using a phase-contrast microscope to confirm that all cells are entirely detached from the culture dish.\nNote: If cells could not be collected well, refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1.\nCritical: PBS should be eliminated from samples at step 12 because PBS affects the signal/noise ratio in mass spectrometry analysis.\nAlso, at step 13, mannitol solution should be added gently to keep cells in pellet form (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nPreparation of charged metabolites for CE-TOFMS analysis\nTiming: 5 h\nThe cell suspension at step 17 contains proteins that increase CE-TOFMS noise. Therefore, additional preparation steps are needed, as previously described (Hirayama et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nTransfer 400 μL of cell suspension (from step 17) into a 1.5 mL tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1814-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Dissolve the dried pellet in 25 μL of the external reference solution and mix by vortexing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nTransfer 7 μL of the sample into a CE vial (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nStore the vial at −80°C until measurement (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J).\nPrepared metabolite analysis using CE-TOFMS analysis\nHighly polar and charged metabolites are analyzed by using a CE-TOFMS system. CE-TOFMS is represented in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A. CE separates metabolites depending on the charge and molecular size. Then, TOFMS detects metabolites by monitoring the range of m/z values.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1814-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
