    "All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA and followed the guidelines established by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.\n1. Animal preparation\nKeep the animals housed under a constant temperature in a light-controlled environment. The temperature settings for the animal housing room should follow the guidelines set forth by the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\". The temperature range for mice is between 18 °C and 26 °C. Keep the humidity levels controlled and set at about 42%.\nFor this experiment, use male C57BL/6J mice (check the Table of Materials for details) that are more than 12 weeks of age (an adult mouse was used for this protocol).\n\tNOTE: A wild-type strain was used in this protocol for the demonstration, as it did not have any genetic abnormalities affecting the retina. However, one could use other strains, including genetically manipulated strains, for the retinal explant culture.\nProvide 12 h light/dark cycles via lighting control in the animal housing rooms.\nInspect every animal for health and adequate food and water intake twice per day during the week and once per day on the weekends. Make sure to provide them with fresh food and clean water.\nIf the food and water levels are low during the week, rinse the water bottle and refill it. Add fresh food whenever needed. Change soiled cages daily or as needed for the health of the animals.\n\tNOTE: To study the photoreceptors and light-induced changes in the retina, dark-adapt the mice overnight in a special dark box located in a dark room in the animal facility.",
    "Euthanize the animals in their home cage by CO2 inhalation overdose using compressed CO2 gas in cylinders connected to a CO2 chamber. Conduct death confirmation using a secondary method of euthanasia such as cervical dislocation.\nAfter completing the procedure, confirm the animal death by an appropriate method, such as confirming cardiac and respiratory arrest or observing fixed and dilated pupils of the animal.\n2. Tissue preparation\nOnce the animal is euthanized, clean the area with 70% ethanol. Then, open the eyelids with one hand so that the eye is visible. Apply pressure to the superior and inferior parts of the orbit with the opposite hand using curved forceps until the globe protrudes.\nTo enucleate the eye, gently close the forceps on the posterior portion of the eye, and elevate in a continuous motion. Using forceps, hold the eyeball from the optic nerve. Make sure to use sterilized dissection tools for all the steps and to work under complete aseptic conditions.\nImmerse each eyeball in a 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of ice-cold HBSS with penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 U/mL). Wash the eyeball in HBSS twice for 5 min each.\nTransfer the eyeball to a 1.5-2 mL tube containing complete media (10% FBS, 2% B27, 1% N2, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin).\n3. Tissue dissection\nDissect out the retina carefully under an operating microscope, as illustrated sequentially in Figure 1.\n\t\nMake a circumferential incision around the limbus to open the eyeball. Remove the cornea by circularly dissecting along the border of the cornea and the (limbal) incision, followed by removing the anterior segment, lens, and vitreous body, leaving an empty eye cup.",
    "By holding the region of the optic nerve head with fine forceps, peel off the outer coat of the eye gently. Pay great attention during the removal of the outer coat in order to not injure the neural retina and to ensure the retina remains totally intact.\n\t\tNOTE: The retina must be carefully peeled away from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and a single cut at the optic nerve head must be performed to detach the retina from the optic nerve. Visually ensure this by identifying the hole left by the optic nerve (the optic nerve head).\nDissect the retina radially into four equal-sized pieces.\nFollow the steps below for handling the small pieces of the retina to ensure proper orientation of the retinal culture.\n\t\nUsing a dissecting scissor blade, open just beneath the retinal piece (Table of Materials).\nSlowly lift the retinal piece with the tip of an open scissor blade, and gently transfer it to the culture plate.\nTransfer the explants derived from the isolated retina separately onto cell culture inserts in a 12-well plate, each containing 300 µL of retinal explant media, with the retinal ganglion cell (neuroretina) side facing up.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the media is DMEM media with N2 and B27 supplements. Add penicillin-streptomycin (10,000 U/mL) to the media as well (Table of Materials). The retina is formed of multiple layers of neuronal cells interconnected via synapses and supported from the outside by the pigmented layer of retinal pigment epithelium, which is the black layer that was removed during the dissection.\nRemove any remnants of the pigmented epithelium; however, these remnants can help in identifying the proper orientation of the explant. Ensure that the pigmented part is facing down and that the non-pigmented part is facing upward.",
    "Incubate the retinal explant culture in humidified incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nMake sure that the retinal surface is facing upward. If the retinal piece is flipped or folded, try to adjust it gently to the correct orientation.\n\t​NOTE: Pay great attention to the correct orientation of the retinal explant in the culture plate. Avoid any flipping or folding of the explant in the culture plate as this will result in failure of the proper growth of the retinal cells in culture.\n4. Retinal explant culture\nMaintain the retinal explant cultures (prepared in steps 3.2-3.3) in humidified incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nChange half of the media from each well every other day for 2 weeks. Do this by pipetting 150 µL from the well carefully. Then, add 150 µL of fresh media back into the well. Avoid flipping the explant when changing the media.\nCheck the explant carefully under the microscope before putting the culture plate back into the incubator. Examine the integrity of the cells and the retinal architecture under a brightfield microscope. Make sure the explant is still oriented correctly. Use both the 4x and 20x objective lenses to examine the explant.\n\tNOTE: Avoid the complete immersion of the explant in the media.\n5. Immunohistochemistry\nAfter 2 weeks, fix the retinal explant by removing the media. Do this by first washing once with 200 µL of 1x PBS and then adding 300 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4, to the well containing the explant and leaving it overnight.\n\tNOTE: This step can be done without removing the culture inserts from the plate. The explants can also be transferred to a 500 µL conical tube, and the washing and fixation can be done inside the tube.",
    "Transfer the explant to a 500 µL conical tube containing 300 µL of 1x PBS-2.5% Triton X for washing.\nWash the fixed explants in the tube three times for 5 min each using medium velocity on a shaker (25 rpm).\nBlock the expected nonspecific reactions by incubating the explant with 300 µL of 1x blocking buffer containing 0.02% thimerosal for 1 h at room temperature prior to the antibody incubation.\nIncubate the fixed explants with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C using medium velocity on a shaker.\n\tNOTE: Detect the retinal endothelial cells in the fixed explant by staining with GSL I, BSL I antibody (lectin) (7:1,000). Detect the glial cells in the retinal explants by staining with rabbit glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:250). Detect the retinal neurons by staining the explant with rabbit NeuN antibody (1:250)29,30. Incubate s{Tual-Chalot, 2013 #117}{Tual-Chalot, 2013 #116}{Tual-Chalot, 2013 #116}ome explants with the lectin, NeuN combination, and incubate others with the lectin, GFAP combination.\nThe next day, remove the primary antibody from the tubes by aspiration with a pipette. Wash the explants with 1x PBS-2.5% Triton X three times for 5 min each using medium velocity on a shaker.\nAdd the secondary antibodies: Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (1:500) (secondary for GFAP and NeuN) and Texas Red (7:1,000) (for the lectin). Incubate for 1 h at room temperature using medium velocity on a shaker.\n\tNOTE: The secondary antibodies are light sensitive, so cover the tube with aluminum foil.\nRemove the secondary antibodies by aspiration, and then wash three times for 5 min each with 1x PBS-2.5% Triton X.\nTransfer the explant from the tube to a glass slide using a transfer pipette. Remove any excess liquid on the slide, and then add one drop of mounting media with DAPI to the slide.",
    "Cover the tissue with a coverslip. Do not allow any air bubbles between the coverslip and the tissue.\nTake the stained slides to the fluorescence microscope, and start taking the images. It is important to cover the stained slides using a slide box as the fluorescence staining is light-sensitive.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
