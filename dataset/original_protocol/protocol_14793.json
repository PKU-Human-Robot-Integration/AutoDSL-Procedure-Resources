    "NOTE: This study was authorized by Ethics committee number CEEA34.PB.103.12.\n1. Use of Piglets as an Animal Model\nPerform the in two groups (n = 6 in each group), matched in terms of sex, age (15 ± 3 months) and weight (30 ± 10 kg) (control group and chronic hypoxia (CH) group). House the CH group for 3 weeks in a hypobaric chamber (0.4 atm), and house the control group in regular normobaric (1 atm) conditions.\nUse a hypobaric chamber consisting of a Plexiglas box with a 2 square meter footprint and a height of 1.6 meters, as shown in Figure 1.\nContinuously monitor and maintain a temperature of 18 °C and a pressure of 0.4 atm. Ensure adequate ventilation by a vacuum pump, enabling an air renewal rate of 8 m3 per hr.\nPlace two animals in the chamber of the appropriate litter. Every 48 hr, return the pressure in the box to normobaric conditions for half an hour to clean the box, in the presence of the two animals, with the box kept closedto prevent them escaping. This method of inducing pulmonary hypertension has been widely validated 13.\nAnesthetizing of the animals\n\t\nAnesthetize the piglets with an initial intravenous injection of sodium thiopental (10 mg/kg) and maintain anesthesia by continuous inhalation of isoflurane (1.5 to 3.5%). Apply two drops of Carbopol gel into the piglets’ eyes to prevent corneal dryness.\nPlace the animals in the left lateral decubitus position with their forelegs tied in a flexed position to expose the chest. Clean the skin with soap and water and then shave using an electric shaver to remove any hair that could impede penetration of the ultrasound through the chest.\nEchocardiogram",
    "Monitor the development of PAH longitudinally and non-invasively by echocardiography. Perform an echo every week using a 3 MHz transducer. Record an electrocardiogram by placing 3 electrodes on the right and left paws and on the right side of the chest.\nRecord two-dimensional and M-mode imaging data in three different incidences (longitudinal, minor axis and apical) using a-Doppler probe. Hold the probe in the right hand and place between the fourth and fifth left intercostal spaces. Move the probe slowly up and down, rotating it right and left until a good image resolution is obtained for the different cardiac structures (i.e. the septum). The acoustic window differs slightly from one animal to another depending on the position of the heart in the chest.\nRecord the ECG at the same time for each of these incidences and for at least 10 cardiac cycles to enable off-line analysis. End diastole is defined as the point in the cardiac cycle coinciding with the onset of the Q wave on the ECG. End systole coincides with the onset of the T wave.\nMeasure mitral and tricuspid valve blood flow by apical view Doppler ultrasound. Place the-Doppler probe at the tip of the manubrium sterni; the sampling zone was located just above the valve to record the blood flow crossing the valve.\nRecord the blood velocity during the cardiac cycle by Doppler flowmetry to obtain the velocity-time integral of the blood flow through the mitral and tricuspid valves and the aortic and pulmonary valves. Use the video graphics array of the echograph to store images at a frame rate of 25 per sec in order to get fixed images or sequence images provided by the echograph.",
    "Measure the dimensions and surface area of the heart cavities using measuring instruments and the contours of the surface areas proposed by the software integrated into the echograph in accordance with international recommendations 14.\nMeasure the free wall thickness of the right ventricle during diastole and systole by TM (time-motion) recording in minor axis incidence 14.\nMeasure the pulmonary artery root diameter at the tip of the pulmonary valves on the minor axis view 14.\nMeasure the septum and the posterior wall of the left ventricle during diastole in TM motion on the longitudinal view at the beginning of the Q waves on the ECG and in systole at the tip of the T wave on the ECG 14.\nMeasure the left ventricular end-diastolic diameters (LVEDD) and left ventricular end-systolic diameters (LVESD). Calculate fractional shortening (FS) using the formula FS (%) = (LVEDD-LVESD)/LVEDD. Measure the diameter of the aorta and the surface area of the right and left atrium.\nFrom the velocity-time integral of the mitral and tricuspid blood flows, measure the following: maximum amplitude of the E and A wave, deceleration half-time of the E wave, flow duration, velocity-time index 14.\nFrom Doppler measurements of the pulmonary artery, measure the following: maximum velocity, ascension half-time, flow duration and its integral 14.\nAssess the left ventricular volume using the Simpson 15 method.\nStore the data for each piglet in a database for subsequent statistical analysis on the whole group.\n2. Right Heart Catheterization\nAnimal preparation\n\t\nBefore pulsatile catheter placement, pig is placed in a hypobaric chamber during 3 weeks in order to induce pulmonary hypertension.\nFast the animals for 24 hr before surgery (24 hr for solid food, 8 to 12 hr for water).",
    "24 hr prior to RHC, have a well-trained vet perform a pre-anesthesia clinical exam to assess mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, global lung and heart functions using a stethoscope and body temperature using a rectal thermometer.\nAdminister injections of Midazolam (intramuscular, 0.5 mg/kg) and morphine hydrochloride (intramuscular, 0.1 mg/kg) 15 to 30 min before the induction of anesthesia. Repeat injection of morphine hydrochloride (0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg, intramuscular) during induction every 4 to 6 hr.\nAdminister sodium thiopental (10 mg/kg, intravenous) via an initial bolus injection of 5 mg/kg then by partial injection until it was effective. Follow this by bag and mask ventilation until endotracheal intubation.\nPiglet intubation\n\t\t\nLubricate the tube with pramocaine gel. Insert a metal stylus into the tube to stiffen it and facilitate the intubation process.\nTouch the eyelid to ensure deep anesthesia. Perform intubation by direct visualization of the larynx, using a laryngoscope to raise the tongue and avoid injury to the vocal cord. Inflate the tube balloon to prevent regurgitation-related issues.\nControl the respiratory rate at 10-12 breaths per minute; current volume of 7-10 ml/kg, insufflation pressure of 25 to 30 cm H2O and an inspiratory phase of 2 sec with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O.\nAnesthetize the animal with isoflurane in 100% oxygen (induction 3-5% with oxygen flow of 2 to 3 L/min, maintenance of 1.5-2.5% oxygen flow at 1 L/min). Apply carbopol gel to the cornea as in step 1.5.1.\nInsert a heparinized catheter into the caudal auricular artery (5 ml of 0.9% saline spiked with 5,000 IU/ml heparin) via subcutaneous infusion with green cannula fixed in place with a suture stitch.\nInfuse lactated Ringer’s solution (10-20 ml/kg/hr).\nPlace the animal on a slightly tilted examination table. Keep the head inclined slightly downwards to promote salivary flow.\nMonitoring",
    "Every 5 min, check and record the following values on the individual anesthesia case report: mucous membrane color and capillary refill time, mandibular muscle tone and eyeball position, miosis/mydriasis, palpebral reflex.\nContinuously monitor the heart and respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, body temperature and electrocardiograms. Insert an arterial introducer into the femoral artery. Insert a large-caliber 10 cm long catheter, into the femoral artery and monitor the systemic blood pressure.\nSetting up of the pulsatile catheter\n\tNOTE: This medical device consists of two catheters placed side-by-side and welded together. The distal part of the first one is connected to a standard balloon with a diameter of 20 mm and a maximum volume capacity of 5 ml. The second catheter enables insertion of a wire to facilitate positioning in the pulmonary artery. The device is 750 mm long with an internal gauge of 0.035 and an external diameter of 12 Fr.\n\t\nFor the experiments, perform pulsation with a small Harvard 683 animal ventilator, which applies an active vacuum to the balloon during deflation and positive pressure during inflation, with a volume of 2.5 ml for each pulse. Use helium as the propellant gas for the balloon pump in order to prevent gas embolism.\nRecord the surface electrocardiographic tracings continuously to document any heart rhythm disturbances during the protocol. In the left femoral artery, connect a sensor device to a 20 gauge catheter, connected to a hemodynamic monitoring system.\nRight heart catheterization\n\t\nWash and shave the neck of the animal. Clean the skin with a cutaneous antiseptic solution (Betadine scrub) using a gauze compress. To demarcate the surgical site, place sterile drapes around the right jugular between the right shoulder and the manubrium sterni.\nMake a 4 cm longitudinal incision with sterile scissors half-way between the right shoulder and the manubrium sterni.",
    "Carefully remove the skin and muscle layers with forceps. Then gently remove the connective tissue surrounding the vein over a length of approximately 5 cm. Clip the distal side to prevent bleeding. Place a binder wire around the proximal side to be able to control the vein opening after hemi-section.\nUsing a specific small very sharp chisel, cut the vein in half transversely. Ensure that the edges of the incision are neat. Using thin foam, raise one edge of the incision and gently push the catheter into the proximal side of the vein. Control bleeding with binder wire.\nIntroduce the catheter into the jugular vein and successively push through the superior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle and, finally, the pulmonary artery.\nRecord the pressures over 10 stable cardiac cycles, on each cardiac cavity and the pulmonary artery (T0). Measure cardiac blood flow three times at 1 min intervals.\nPosition the balloon catheter in the pulmonary artery under radioscopic control. Inflate and deflate the balloon (pulsation) with 1 cm3 of helium. Continue pulsation for 10 min. Record pressures over 10 stable cardiac cycles, in each cardiac cavity and the pulmonary artery and measure the cardiac blood flow after 10 min (T1).\nMeasure the cardiac blood flow again 30 min after the pulsatility protocol (T2).\n3. NO Measurement\nConnect a Douglas bag to the exhaled respiratory gas outlet pipe until it is completely filled. Place it over the in-pipe of a NO breath analyzer.\nSlowly and constantly force the exhaled air into the analyzer by compressing the elastic Douglas bag. Measure the bag outflow by the flowmeter of the analyzer to maintain a constant flow.\n4. Histology Measurements\nUnder anesthesia, inject 30 ml of Dolethal (injectable solution for euthanasia) into the pulsatile catheter placed in the heart.",
    "Immediately after euthanasia, open the chest by sawing the manubrium longitudinally, slightly move the heart and hold the right lung. Then using dissecting scissors, cut two 2 or 3 cm3 samples from the middle lobe of the lung.\nSnap freeze one sample in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Fix the second sample in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and then embed in paraffin for subsequent histological analysis.\nPerform histology measurements as previously described 16. Measure the PA wall thickness as follows: 2 measurements/artery in 10 arteries/piglet and in 6 piglets/group.\nPerform statistical analysis. Values were expressed as fold change ± SEM.\n\t\nTo compare two means, use an unpaired Student’s t test. To compare more than two means, use a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunn’s test. A p <0.05 was considered statistically significant (*).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
