    "**PREPARATION**\n Close all serum vials with the  stoppers and the aluminum caps. Take care that both are well fixed and centered. Use the crimp pliers to close the vial. \n Evacuate the closed vials as follows: Insert the needle into the tube and fix both at the outlet of the vacuum pump. Insert the needle into the middle of the butyl stopper of the vial and let the pump run until the vial is completely evacuated \\(it takes one to two minutes, depending on the pump’s capacity). The evacuation has succeeded well if the butyl stopper indents a little.\n Label the evacuated vials with symbols enable you to distinguish between the blind sample \\(v<sub>B</sub>), ambient air \\(v<sub>AA</sub>) and equilibrated air \\(v<sub>EA</sub>). \nTIMING: The preparation takes around 10 minutes for 3 samples \\(including assembly and dismantling of the pump construction).\n**SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS**\n Measure or describe the following parameters: water temperature, air pressure and relevant events \\(weather, discharge or wave intensity). The descriptive information can be a help when it comes to interpreting the data.\n Sample the control. To this end, inject 10 ml of a CO<sub>2</sub>-free gas \\(nitrogen) or standard gas in v<sub>B</sub> using the 60 ml syringe. The gas enters the vial automatically if the evacuation was performed correctly. Since it is impossible to evacuate a vial completely a control measurement has to be taken for the background correction. \n Take a 10 ml sample of ambient air directly over the water surface and inject it into v<sub>AA</sub>. \nAs an alternative, artificial air free of CO<sub>2</sub> \\(nitrogen or from a scrubber) can be used instead of ambient air. In the latter case the results from v<sub>AA</sub> should be the same as those from v<sub>B</sub>.",
    "Now the main sampling takes place: Fill the syringe with 40 ml water. Create a headspace in the syringe by sampling 20 ml of ambient air. As an alternative, CO<sub>2</sub>-free air can be used to create the headspace. Equilibrate both phases by shaking the syringe for 1 minute under the water surface. Since the saturation of the water and hence the amount of gas that drifts into the gas phase are dependent on the temperature it is important that the equilibration is done at water temperature and therefore below the surface. This could make a significant difference where springs are sampled during the summer, for instance. The temperature of the spring might be below 10°C whilst the air temperature is around 30°C. Also, if the sample is shaken in the air, the temperature of the sampler’s hand could affect the temperature of the solvent and thus the equilibration of both phases. \n Flush the needle of the syringe by discarding 10 ml of the equilibrated gas after equilibration is finished. \n Inject the remaining equilibrated gas into v<sub>EA</sub>. \n Store all vials at approximately 6°C until further analysis can take place. Analyses should be done within 48 hours, especially where higher concentrations are expected <sup>4</sup>. \nSubsequent gas analyses can be performed using an infrared gas analyzer or headspace gas chromatography. The choice of device \\(for instance the detector) depends on the one hand on the laboratory equipment and on the other hand on the anticipated concentration.   \n**TIMING:** The sampling procedure takes approximately 10 minutes for 3 samples, including registration of  environmental parameters. Since different protocols exist on how CO<sub>2</sub> should be analyzed, the analysis itself can take 5 to 15 minutes per sample. The time needed for calibration and the instrument’s warm-up time are not taken into consideration. This takes approximately one hour.",
    "**CALCULATION**\nThe following values are required for the calculation of the partial pressure and the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in water: \n measured CO<sub>2</sub> concentration from different vials \\(unit=ppmv or mgL<sup>-1</sup>; C<sub>B</sub>=concentration v<sub>B</sub>; C<sub>AA</sub>=concentration v<sub>AA</sub>; C<sub>EA</sub>=concentration v<sub>EA</sub>), \n air pressure \\(p<sub>A</sub> in atm) \n water temperature \\(T<sub>w</sub> in K).\nA step by step explanation of the calculation procedure is given below. \n \n1. Correct the concentrations \\(ppmv) of ambient air \\(C<sub>AA</sub>) and equilibrated air \\(C<sub>EA</sub>) for background concentration by subtracting C<sub>B</sub>. If several samples are taken it is necessary to determine the mean of a suitable number of blind samples. Before doing this, discard obvious outliers and calculate the mean, and use this as the correction factor for all samples. The standard deviation can be used for subsequent sensitivity analysis, if required. \n  \n 2. **Multiply the resulting C<sub>EA</sub> by 2**. This is a constant that needs to be included since only half of the equilibrated air was transferred into the evacuated vial \\(in this case: 10 ml of 20 ml). According to the ideal gas law, the concentration of C<sub>EA</sub> was thus halved, and this needs to be compensated by doubling the value. If greater or lesser amounts of gas are transferred into the vial, the calculation must be adapted accordingly. \n 3. Calculate the gas volume of the experiment \\(V<sub>Exp</sub> in L mol<sup>-1</sup>) as derived from the ideal gas law:\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3897/original/Equation_1.png?1505742273\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(1) \nTo describe the ideal gal, the molar volume \\(V<sub>i</sub>=V/n=22.414 L mol<sup>-1</sup>) of the ideal gas at standard pressure \\(p<sub>i</sub>=1 atm) and temperature \\(T<sub>i</sub>=273.15 K) can be used<sup>21</sup>.\n \n4. Calculate the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in mol in the headspace before equilibration \\(C<sub>before</sub>) using equation 2:\n  <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3899/original/Equation_2.png?1505742304\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(2)",
    "Whereby 10<sup>-6</sup> and 10<sup>-3</sup> are unit-conversion factors. 10 ml indicates the amount of sampled air. Values have to become adapted accordingly.\n 5. Calculate _C<sub>after</sub>_ \\(in mol), the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the headspace after equilibration using the following formula:\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3901/original/Equation_3.png?1505742363\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(3)\n \n6. For the following step calculate first _k<sub>0</sub>_, the Henry constant \\(_k<sub>H</sub>_, mol L<sup>-1</sup> atm<sup>-1</sup>, k<sub>H</sub>=k<sub>0</sub>) for freshwater. Use the formula given in Weiss <sup>10</sup>: \n  <a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3903/original/Equation_4.jpg?1505742474\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(4)\nwith A<sub>1</sub>=-58.0931; A<sub>2</sub>=90.5069; and A<sub>3</sub>=22.2940 \\(unit in mol L<sup>-1</sup> atm<sup>-1</sup>). To my knowledge, the formula given in Weiss<sup>10</sup> is actually state of the art. If waters with higher salinity are sampled, _k<sub>H</sub>_, can be calculated according to the full equation given there. If other gases are required \\(for instance CH<sub>4</sub>) the calculation of _k<sub>H</sub>_ must be adapted accordingly <sup>11,20</sup>.\n 7. Now determine _C<sub>Equ</sub>_, which is the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in water after equilibration according to Equation 5.\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3905/original/Equation_5.png?1505742500\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(5)\n 8. Calculate _C<sub>water</sub>_, the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in mol in the water after equilibration \\(cp. Equation 6):\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3907/original/Equation_6.png?1505742539\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(6)\nwith _V<sub>w</sub>_ as the volume of sampled water \\(_V<sub>w</sub>_= 40 ml). \n 9. Finally, calculate the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in water \\(in mol L<sup>-1</sup>) and pCO<sub>2</sub> \\(ppmv or µatm) as described in Equations 7 and 8\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3909/original/Equation_7.png?1505742594\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(7)  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3911/original/Equation_8.png?1505742617\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(8)",
    "10. Apply the quality control procedure based on precision analysis of duplicates as described in Lambert and Fréchette <sup>4</sup>. To this end, take all samples in pairs. The statistical sampling design must of course be adapted to take account of the specific issue being investigated or environmental conditions. In some cases it is therefore advisable to take three or more samples. Calculate the degree of precision using the following equation:\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3913/original/Equation_9.png?1505742641\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(9)\nwith _pc_ as the precision coefficient, d<sub>i</sub> as the difference between two duplicates, and n as the number of duplicate pairs. Convert the precision to a percentage using equation 10.\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3915/original/Equation_10.png?1505742658\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n\\(10)\nwhere m is the mean of the duplicates. The degree of precision of the results is high if _pc_ \\(%) is low \\(in the extreme, equal values have a _pc_ of 0%). \n**_ANTICIPATED RESULTS_**\nThe example given below can be used to illustrate the calculation step-by-step. The experimental conditions of the fictitious experiment are as follows: p<sub>A</sub>=0.95 atm and T<sub>w</sub>=285 K. The samples were taken at 5 locations with the same environmental pressure \\(same depth or same altitude). The water temperature was also the same for all locations. Three control samples were taken for \nthe background correction. The mean concentration of the controls is C<sub>B</sub>=21 \\(SD 12). The experimental conditions and the results are given in Table 2. Change the input data \\(especially pressure and temperature) and observe how it affects the outcome.\n**Table 2**_\n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/3919/original/Table_2.png?1505742686\">See figure in Figures section.</a>"
