    "This study was carried out in strict accordance with the institutional guidelines of the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany, as well as the European Community Council Directive (86/609/EEC). All experiments were communicated to and approved by the Animal Welfare Office at the Animal Care and Use Facility of the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany (institutional act number: O52/05). In accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act (Tierschutzgesetz, Articles 4 and 7), no formal additional approval for the postmortem removal of brain tissue was necessary.\nFor generation of acute slices, mice were anaesthetized with CO2 and quickly decapitated (following the recommendation of the European Commission published in: Euthanasia of experimental animals, Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 1997; ISBN 92–827-9694-9).\n1. Preparation of Solutions\nPrepare artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for dissection containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 6 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 20 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, resulting in a pH of 7.4.\nPrepare ACSF for experiments containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 20 glucose, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, resulting in a pH of 7.4.\nPrepare intracellular solution (ICS) containing (in mM): 150 KMeSO3, 12.5 hydroxy ethyl piperazine ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES), 40 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1.25 ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 5 Mg-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP. Adjust pH to 7.3. Store aliquots of 1 ml at -20 °C.\nDilute sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI)-salt in double-distilled water and prepare aliquots of 5 µl of a 10 mM stock solution.\nThaw ICS and add SBFI stock solution at a final concentration of 1 mM. Vortex and micro-filtrate (0.22 µm). Keep at 4 °C until used in experiment. Do not refreeze and only use for one day.",
    "Prepare MNI glutamate stock solution of 50 mM by dissolving the compound in double-distilled water. Dilute MNI glutamate stock solution to a final concentration of 5 mM in normal ACSF. Keep at 4 °C until used in experiment. Do not refreeze and only use for one day. Store aliquots, which are not immediately used in the experiment, at -20 °C.\n2. Dissection of Tissue\nNOTE: The preparation of acute hippocampal slices of the rodent brain was described in detail earlier13,14. In brief, the following protocol was employed in the present study.\nAfter decapitation, rapidly remove the brain from the skull.\nImmediately place the brain in a petri dish with ice-cold dissection ACSF and dissect a hemisphere by performing a sagittal cut along the midline.\nPerform a second cut in the desired orientation as a blocking surface and attach this to the cutting stage of a vibratome with superglue.\nTake cutting chamber and cooling element (both kept at -20 °C) of the vibratome out of the freezer and place cutting stage with brain section in the chamber. Then put cooling element in the chamber and submerge tissue in ice-cold dissection ACSF. To stabilize the preparation, one may want to counter the tissue block with agar gel.\nCut 250 µm thick, parasagittal slices of the hippocampus with the vibratome. Ensure that all ACS fluids are bubbled at all times.\nAfter slicing, keep tissue on a mesh in a beaker with the normal ACSF and incubate at 34 °C for 30 min. Then keep at room temperature.\n3.

    "Figure 1. Scheme showing light paths and experimental control of the rig consisting of multi-photon imaging, laser-scanning UV flash photolysis, and electrophysiology. The multi-photon beam (red) is produced by a pulsed, tunable infrared (IR) laser (TiSa). It passes a mechanical shutter, a Pockels’ cell, and the IR detector (detection of beam intensity), all of which enable control of the laser power and its administration duration. The flip-in/flip-out optional laser diode is employed for basic alignment of the laser beam. The beam expander may be used in combination with objectives with an extremely wide back-focal plane. The remote-controlled ND filter wheel may be used in addition or instead of the Pockels’ cell to control laser beam power. After passing the scan head, the pulsed IR-light is guided to the specimen. Emitted fluorescence light (light green) is collected either by the external or the internal photomultiplier detectors (PMTs). The external detectors are fully synchronized with the internal PMTs via a high frequency switch (PMT controller). The uncaging beam (light blue) is produced by a UV solid-state laser (DPSS UV-Laser). It is then directed to the galvo-driven scanning unit at the top-back of the epi-fluorescence condenser by a light guide. The precise positioning (chromatic aberration between imaging and uncaging beam) of the uncaging spot or area is enabled by the image export from the imaging software. The timing management for synchronizing the imaging, the electrophysiology, and the flash photolysis is electronically controlled. The transillumination detector (TL-PMT) is of need for documentation of the positioning of the pipettes within the tissue. The control units and software of the imaging system, which has been modified, is used to control and synchronize all other devices needed to run the system. System components labeled as “custom” were designed and build/adapted by the authors.",
    "Some components were adapted to meet the requirements of the custom-build multi-photon system and are labeled as “modified”. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52038/52038fig1highres.jpg]",
    "Switch on components of the multi-photon system. Test and adjust infrared laser beam alignment.\n\t\nControl beam positioning by flipping in the centering prism instead of an objective. If the beam is dislocated, re-adjust it by the mirrors in the periscope. Note that the centering plane of the prism must be at the same level as the back focal plane of the objective while imaging.\nSwitch on the spectrometer and check for the multi-photon characteristics of the beam.\nSet parameters of the imaging software to the following values: Choose a frame size of 512 x 512 pixels for overview images of the cell (smaller clip boxes with a zoom factor of 2.5 for high frame rate and high spatial resolution, respectively). Set imaging speed to fast mode and scan mode to XYT. Z-stepping should be 1 µm for overview stacks and 0.2 µm for detailed stacks to match spatial sampling requirements for deconvolution performed later.\nAdjust multi-photon laser beam (790 nm) intensity by altering settings of the Pockels’ cell (final power under the objective: ≈ 14 - 16 µW) and the photo-multipliers (PMTs).\nSwitch on and calibrate uncaging system by placing a fluorescent sample slide under the objective lens.\n\t\nUsing the binoculars, adjust the focus of the UV optics and spatially limit the UV laser spot to a size of 2 µm in diameter at maximum by employing the focusing unit at the UGA scan head.\nStart the calibration routine of the uncaging unit control software.\n\t\t\nSet the UV laser to several points within its scan range, while the fluorescence is captured with a CCD camera. By clicking on the UV laser spot at each point, adjust the positioning of the galvanic scan mirrors to correspond to a certain coordinate in the software.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52038/52038fig2highres.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Detailed scheme illustrating the characteristics ofexcitation, emission and uncaging beam paths. The IR excitation beam (red) passes the beam combining dichroic mirror at the level to the filer turret in the epi-fluorescence condenser of the microscope and the objective to reach the specimen. The uncaging beam (blue) is delivered via a quartz optical light fiber to the collimation and beam focusing unit and then subsequently guided to the scanning mirrors in the scanning unit, passes a dichroic mirror to the beam combining dichroic mirror. Here it is combined with the excitation scanning beam. The emitted light from the specimen follows the path of the excitation scanning beam path in the opposite orientation towards the imaging scan head. The camera is used for visual control of the patch pipette and for positioning of the uncaging beam in combination with the confocal laser scanning microscope (not shown). The green light path represents an optional epi-fluorescence illumination which may be of use with other applications.\nUse the flash photolysis system in the spot mode to gain focal applications. Ensure that the focal adjustment of the uncaging beam (average power underneath the objective: 0.55 mW) results in a spot size of 1.5 µm in diameter (xy extension) as revealed at a fluorescent slide positioned at a z-level that corresponds to that of a tissue slice (not shown).\nThe accurate positioning of the uncaging spot is achieved by the import of an image of the imaging system via a network connection between uncaging- and imaging-computers.",
    "Using a screen grabber software, continuously read out the frames of the imaging software (instead of the camera feed) and adjust the imaging and uncaging frames congruently. Export every 10th frame from the imaging software as a reference image into the flash unit to ensure proper adjustment during the entire experiment.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52038/52038fig3highres.jpg\nFigure 3. Adjustment of the uncaging spot: To precisely position the uncaging spot, a screen shot of the imaging software (yellow frame) is imported into the uncaging software (green frame). The left image within the yellow frame represents a Hi-Lo coded image (blue: black pixels, red: saturated pixels) of the entire CA1 pyramidal cell. The image is overlaid by the calibration grid of the uncaging software (green “X”s). To the right, a magnified part of the cell is shown with the overlaid uncaging spot (red cross). The yellow spot is the automatically overlaid image of the uncaging beam.

This will reduce costs enormously as compared to bath perfusion of these substances. Adjust the holding pressure to the given atmospheric pressure to prevent a drag of ACSF into or a leakage of caged substances from the application pipette.\n\tNOTE: The pressure application device hosts a highly precise and ultrafast micro-valve in the pipette holder. This enables to employ minimal application pressures and therefore reduces movement artifacts to a minimum during the local perfusion with the caged compound.",
    "Pull pipettes for whole-cell patch-clamp and local perfusion using fire-polished borosilicate glass capillaries. Pipettes should have a tip diameter of ~1 µm and a resistance of R ≈ 3 MΩ (values determined with K-MeSO3-based ICS).\nPlace slice in the experimental bath and affix it with a grid (platinum frame 250 µM thick, spanned with surgical filaments, o.d. 40 µm) (Figure 4A, B). Use an inverted, tip-broken, and fire-polished Pasteur pipette (suction ball at the side of the broken tip) for slice transfer. Avoid bending and any other harsh handling of the slice.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52038/52038fig4highres.jpg\nFigure 4. Components of the experimental bath and positioning of the bath at the microscope stage. (A) The experimental bath consists of the bath chamber itself (blue square), which is surrounded by a magnetic metal ring. The tubing ensures continuous perfusion of the bath with saline (ACSF). The grid to hold down and fix the slice is put into the bath chamber. (B) Acute slice preparation positioned within the bath chamber. The slice is fixed by the threads of the grid. (C) Positioning and geometry of the experimental bath at the microscope stage during the experiments.\nPlace bath at the microscope stage and permanently perfuse slice with ACSF.\n4. Whole-cell Patch-clamping\nLoad patch pipette with ICS containing SBFI and load local perfusion pipette with caged compound. Attach pipettes to corresponding micromanipulators. Place reference electrode in bath. Make sure that you are grounded permanently to avoid damage to the head stage (c.f. Figure 4C).\nLower both pipettes into bath and place them above the hippocampal CA1 region. Apply gentle pressure to patch pipette (+40 mbar) to avoid dilution of the ICS with ACSF.\nCompensate the offset potential of the patch pipette using the electrophysiology software.",
    "Approach a CA1 pyramidal cell with patch pipette employing IR-DIC video microscopy. Apply gentle suction until a Giga-seal is obtained. Choose a cell the soma of which is located 30 -70 µm below the surface of the slice to ensure intact cell morphology on the one hand side and low scattering and attenuation of the uncaging beam on the other hand side.\nCompensate for fast capacity. Break membrane and open cell to gain whole-cell configuration.\nCompensate for slow capacity and series resistance.\nAllow the cell to be dialyzed with the SBFI-ICS for at least 30 min before starting the imaging experiments.\n5. Multi-photon imaging and stimulation\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52038/52038fig5highres.jpg\nFigure 5. Experimental protocol. To initialize an experiment, a trigger pulse (indicated by red sign (ᴨ)and the red line) is set to simultaneously start the imaging (blue), the electrophysiology (green), and the administration of the caged compound (yellow) at time point 0 sec. During this first period, the imaging beam should be entirely dimmed (light blue). After 4.5 sec (dashed line), the local perfusion of the caged compound is terminated and the imaging beam should be set to its working intensity for data acquisition (blue). 1.5 sec afterwards (time point 6 sec), a second trigger pulse is given (indicated by red sign (ᴨ) and the red line), which initializes the UV flash unit (duration of the flash: 300 msec; indicated by the yellow flash) and sets markers in the electrophysiology and the imaging protocol.\nAdd tetrodotoxin (TTX, 500 nM) to ACSF to prevent activation of voltage-gated sodium channels and generation of action potentials.\nVisualize cellular morphology using multi-photon excitation and resulting SBFI fluorescence and choose a spiny dendrite for experiment. Zoom in for images at a higher resolution and place a clip box around the dendrite.",
    "Fill a standard patch pipette with 10 µl ACSF containing caged glutamate. Connect the pipette to the pressure application system and attach it to the micromanipulator.\nPlace pipette with caged compound near the dendrite (~30 µm). Position the pipette to allow efficient local perfusion of the dendrite of choice. Adjust the uncaging laser: position the uncaging spot close (~1 - 2 µm) to the structure of interest.\nSet regions of interest on the chosen dendrite and adjacent spines using imaging software.\nApproach the region of interest and focally inject the caged compound for several sec with low pressure (<3 PSI). Start patch clamp and fluorescence recordings (at 790 nm multi-photon excitation) via trigger signal.\n\tNOTE: During the local perfusion of the caged compound, the excitation beam is completely dimmed to prevent bleaching.\nStop local perfusion of the caged compound. Increase intensity of the two-photon laser to enable efficient excitation of SBFI and apply a UV flash to initialize uncaging (uncaging duration 300 msec).\nMonitor changes in SBFI fluorescence. Stop recording after SBFI fluorescence has recovered back to baseline.\n6. Pharmacology\nTo test the involvement of ionotropic glutamate receptors in the generation of the currents and/or sodium signals evoked by UV flash photolysis of caged glutamate, employ receptor blockers.\n\t\nSwitch to ACSF containing the AMPA-receptor blocker cyano-nitroquinoxaline-dione (CNQX, 10 µM) and the NMDA-receptor blocker amino-phosphonopentanoate (APV, 50 µM) in addition to TTX (see above) and perfuse slice for at least 10 min.\nRepeat stimulation procedure (see 5.4 and 5.5.)\nReversibility of the inhibitors’ effects\n\t\nSwitch back to normal ACSF containing only TTX.\nPerfuse slice for 20 min.\nRepeat stimulation procedure (see 5.4 and 5.5.).\n7. Morphology",
    "Record a XYZ-stack of the clip box-region set for the performed measurements. Ensure that this stack is oversampled spatially (at least 0.2 µm per pixel) to enable optimal image deconvolution and to increase image quality and resolution.\nRecord a XYZ-stack of the entire cell to assess cell morphology.\nRun deconvolution algorithm."
