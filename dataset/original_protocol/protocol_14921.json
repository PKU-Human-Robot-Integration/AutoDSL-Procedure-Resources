    "The Ethics Board of Hasselt University and University Hospital Antwerp approved the studies. Participants gave their written informed consent to participate.\n1. Instrument Setup\nRemove the black protection shells from the digital retinal camera and the main block of the unit.\nOpen the battery compartment and place the battery in the camera. Do not disconnect the wire connecting the battery and the main unit.\nScrew the camera onto the main unit and connect the two wires. Connect the main unit to the power grid and to the computer with the supplied USB cables.\nStart the main unit by switching the on/off button to “on”. Start the camera by switching the on/off button to “on”.\nStart the computer. This will prevent connection errors between the main unit and the computer.\n2. Capturing Photograph\nStart the Retinal Imaging Control Software (and fill in the required password). The software is a part of the digital retinal camera (see materials table for link).\nStart the study by clicking the “Study” icon in the upper left part of the screen. For a new patient, fill in all the details such as patient ID, patient name, date of birth, etc. If the patient is already in the system, fill in the “patient ID” and use the “Search history list”. Double-click on the name of the patient to start the study.\nAsk the patient to take a seat before the camera, place his/her chin on the chin rest and the forehead against the forehead rest and “lock” the head to take a photograph.\nAsk the patient to look straight into the lens of the camera. Move the camera in the horizontal (X-Y) plane to the right or left eye.",
    "Use the chin rest to position the cornea of the patient inside the two circles that appear on the camera display. Fine-tune by using the wheel on the joystick.\nMove the camera forward, backward, and sideways in the X-Y plane in order to position the pupil of the patient within the circles. Make sure the pupil forms a continuous circle. By doing so, the iris of the patient will be split up in two pieces.\nUse the “back trigger” on the joystick to switch from the cornea to the retina. At this stage, the patient should observe a green light. Ask the patient to look at the green light.\nFocus the camera by aligning the two lines that pop up when the wheel at the base of the joystick is turned. Turn the wheel until the two lines form a continuous line.\nUse the green light to place the eye in the optimal position for a photograph. If required, move the light using the arrow buttons at the right side of the camera. Position the green light in a way that the optic disc is centered on the camera display.\nSearch for 2 white spots which appeared after switching to the retina (in step 2.7). To find the spots, move the unit in the X-Y plane. The spots are visible as a blurry stain. Move the unit forward or backwards until blurry stains turn into bright, white spots. The brighter and rounder the spots, the better the quality of the picture is. Position the spots until both are visible. Use the little wheel on the joystick to bring the spots to the middle of the camera display.",
    "Confirm that the two lines (from step 2.8) form a continuous line. The optic disc is centered on the camera display and is flanked by two bright, white spots. Take the retinal photograph by firing the button on top of the joystick.\nSave the photograph by pressing the “Study Complete” button on the lower right corner of the computer screen. Completing the study will automatically save the pictures in a map and close the study.\n3. Analysis of Retinal Photograph\nDetermine the scale ratio by measuring the distance between the center of macula (fovea) and the center of the optic disc (blind spot). Anatomically this distance is determined to be 4,500 µm or 2.5x the diameter of the optic disc, with the latter being approximately 1,800 µm. Ensure the distance is measured in pixels. Calculate the scale ratio by dividing 4,500 by the distance (in pixels) between the macula and blind spot.\nOpen the retinal vessel analysis software “IVAN”.\n\tNOTE: The software is created at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Detailed information on the usage of IVAN is taken from the manual.\nFill in the scale ratio and proceed through the configuration.\nVerify that three yellow rings appear on the retinal photograph. The scale ratio determines the radius of the inner circle and encloses the optic disc. Verify that the middle point of the inner ring is on the middle point of the optic disc. If this is not the case, adjust the location of the circle by using the cursor keys. The radii of the middle and outer circles are 2x and 3x larger than the radius of the inner circle, respectively. In this way, zones A and B are created at a fixed distance from the optic disc.",
    "Check that the retinal image has the optic disc in the center of the photograph. This ensures a sharp focus of the image in zone B and this will facilitate the grading process (Figure 4A).\nObserve that the software automatically detects the blood vessels and assigns these vessels as venules (Figure 4B).\nDistinguish the vessels between arterioles and venules based on physiological differences. Arterioles will be indicated in red and venules in blue (Figure 4C). Use the following guidelines to identify each vessel:\n\t\nDetermine the vessel color. Arterioles have a lighter orange-red color with a strong central light reflection. Veins have darker purple-red color with little or no central light reflex.\nDetermine the course of the vessel. Arterioles tend to be straighter and smoother in outline; they are more regular in both path and outline. Venules are generally more tortuous, and more irregular in outline and diameter. Venules are broader in diameter at the disc margin than the corresponding arterioles.\nIdentify the vessel by looking at the annotation of the preceding vessel. In principle, arterioles alternate with venules. Therefore, if a distinct venule is measured, the next vessel is more likely to be an arteriole.\nDefine the crossing pattern. As a general rule, arterioles do not cross arterioles and venules do not cross venules. If a vessel of unknown identity crosses a venous branch within or distal to Zone B, then the unknown vessel is an arteriole. If it crosses an arteriolar branch within or distal to Zone B, then it is a venule.\nIdentify smaller branches by tracing them proximally to their branching from a parent vessel, the identity of which may be evident from the first two guidelines. Use angles between vessels to differentiate crossings and branchings.",
    "NOTE: Crossings are frequently almost perpendicular (90°) or, if the two vessels are coursing in parallel, the angle of the crossing may be very shallow (less than 30°). Branchings are usually somewhat less than perpendicular (with the angle between the two branches from 30° to 45°).\nSelect the full length of the vessel in the grading zone. Make sure that the standard deviation of the selected vessel does not exceed the value of 10. Smaller standard deviations indicate a good measurement.\nUse the software tools to select vessels that were not selected by the software itself. The same rules apply for these vessels as for the vessels automatically selected by the software.\nDetermine Central Retinal Arteriolar and Venular Equivalent (CRAE and CRVE) automatically in IVAN.\nCalculate the CRAE and CRVE from their respective branching daughter vessels using revised formulas of Parr and Hubbard28.\n\tNOTE: The relationship between trunks and branches, with empirically derived branching coefficients, is given in following two formulas to approximate vessel equivalents. IVAN uses the six largest arterioles and venules for calculating CRAE and CRVE. The formulas are applied in an iterative procedure to pair up the six largest arterioles (or venules) until the central arteriolar (or venular) vessel equivalent is obtained.\n\tArterioles: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51904/51904eq1.jpg (1)\n\tVenules: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51904/51904eq2.jpg (2)\n\twhere w1, w2, and W are the widths of the narrower branch, the wider branch, and the parent trunk, respectively.",
    "NOTE: Assume that in a retinal photograph the six largest arterioles are 120, 110, 100, 90, 80, and 70 µm wide. Put 120 and 70 into equation (1), as well as 110 and 80, and 100 and 90. After the first iteration there are three values: 122.2, 120.0, and 118.4. Perform the next iteration by pairing 122.2 and 118.4, yielding 149.8. Carry over the middle number (120.0) to the final iteration. Pair 149.8 and 120.0 to yield 168.7 for CRAE.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
