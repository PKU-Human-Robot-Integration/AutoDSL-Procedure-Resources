    "All experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines of Konkuk University.\n1. Agarose Salt Bridges Between the Bath Solution and Ag/AgCl Reference Electrode\nNOTE: Agarose 3M KCl salt bridges are produced as previously described12 with minor variations.\nFormation of bridges\n\t\nBend the fire glass capillary tubes to form a U-shape as appropriate. The inner diameter of the capillaries should be large enough for reducing series resistance when recording large ion currents. Tubes with an inner diameter of 2-5 mm are usually acceptable.\nPreparation of agarose 3 M KCl solution\n\t\nPrepare 100 mL of 3 M KCl solution (1 M or 2 M is also acceptable).\nWeigh 3 g of agarose.\nDissolve the agarose in 100 mL of KCl (i.e., 3% agarose) on a hot plate between 90 and 100 °C.\nLoading the bridges with 3 M KCl agarose\n\t\nFor easy loading, immerse the U-shaped glass bridges in the agarose-KCl solution.\n\t\tNOTE: It is easy to dig out the glass bridges if the agarose-KCl solution is contained in a shallow and broad container.\nKeep them overnight at room temperature (RT) for the agarose to set and harden.\nCarefully dig out the agarose-KCl-loaded glass bridges from the set/hardened agarose-salt.\nStoring the bridges\n\t\nPrepare enough volume (i.e., 500 mL) of the 3 M KCl solution in a wide-necked bottle.\nStore the prepared agarose-salt bridges in the bottle in a refrigerator.\n2. Application of Fluid Flow Shear Force to Cells in a Patch-Clamping Chamber\nNOTE: A schematic diagram of the patch-clamp experimental set-up is shown in Figure 1.\nPlace a container loaded with bathing solution (volume and height should already be measured) above the patch-clamp chamber.\nFill the patch-clamp chamber with the bathing solution by suctioning the tube.",
    "To stop the fluid flow, clip the tube at the container’s side to block the fluid flow, then clip the tube at the suction side to stop the suction at the same time. This is the “stationary” control condition.\nTo apply fluid flow shear force, open both tubes on the container and suction sides at the same time.\nBefore or after applying the fluid flow shear force to the cell, measure the flow rate in mL/min.\nCalculate the flow rate by measuring the decrease in fluid volume over a given time.\nFrom the measured flow rate and geometry (structure) of the bathing chamber, the shear force applied to the cell by the fluid flow should be estimated (see discussion section).\nAlternatively, to control the flow rate (for steps 2.3-2.6), use a perfusion pump. In this case, be careful to ensure a constant rather than a pulsatile flow.\n3. Measuring Changes in Liquid-Metal Junction Potential by Fluid Flow Between Bath Solution and Ag/AgCl Reference Electrode (Figure 3A)\nUse the Ag/AgCl electrode or pellet, which is available from the ready-made products, without the agarose salt bridge.\nPrepare a normal physiological salt saline for the bathing chamber (e.g., 143 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.33 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 11 mM D-glucose; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH).\nPlace a patch pipette containing a 3 M KCl solution in the chamber to minimize the junction potential shift between the pipette and bathing solutions.\nFix the voltage-clamp amplifier to the current clamp mode (“I = 0” or “CC”).\nAfter nullifying the initial offset potential, measure changes in voltage induced by various flow rates.",
    "To verify that the changes in voltage are liquid/metal junction potentials, re-examine the effect of fluid flow on the junction potential using the agarose-salt bridge between the bath solution and Ag/AgCl electrode.\n4. Experimental Estimation of Real Cl- Concentration in the Unstirred Layer Adjacent to Ag/AgCl Electrode Under Static Condition (Figure 3B)\nFrom the results of step 3, draw the junction potential-flow rate relationships and estimate the maximal (saturating) value of junction potential shift by the supra-fluid flow rate.\nPrepare solutions with various concentrations of Cl (i.e., 50, 99, 147, 195, and 288 mM of NaCl).\nBy changing the Cl- concentration in the bathing fluid, draw the junction potential-[Cl-] relationship. Note that the fluid rate should be constant and sufficiently high (> 30 mL/min) to prevent the decrease of Cl- concentration to that of the adjacent Ag/AgCl reference electrode.\nFrom the two relationship curves, estimate the changes in Cl- concentration from the measured junction potential shift.\nSubscription Required.
