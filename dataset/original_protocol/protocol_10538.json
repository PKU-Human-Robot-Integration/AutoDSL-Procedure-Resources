    "1. Magnetic Bead-based Exosome Extraction\nPipette a well-mixed solution of 5 µl of Streptavidin-Coated magnetic microparticles into 495 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer in a microcentrifuge tube to resuspend the beads. Wash and resuspend the beads with 500 µl of PBS three times using a magnetic rack. The rack is an array of magnets on the side of a housing unit that can hold the sample microcentrifuge tubes.\n\t\nFor each wash, first let the tubes sit on the rack for 1 min, and then use a pipette tip to carefully remove the supernatant buffer without disturbing the beads.\nPlace the tubes on a regular rack without magnets at the side. Add 500 µl of PBS into the tubes, and use the pipette to mix the solution and beads together. Then put the tubes back on the magnetic rack to again separate the beads from the solution.\nPerform this removal of buffer via magnetization and resuspension in PBS a total of three times. This performs an initial wash of the magnetic particles.\nResuspend the beads into 490 µl of PBS buffer, with the tube placed on the non-magnetized portion of the magnetic rack. Pipet 5 µl of biotinylated mouse anti-human CD63 antibody at 1.0 mg/ml stock concentration into the mixture of beads. Use the pipette to mix the beads and antibody in solution.\nPlace the microcentrifuge tubes with bead and biotinylated antibody mixture on a sample rotator. Set the rotator parameters for the sample rotator for reciprocal rotation at 90° tilting for 5 sec and vibrating at 5° for 1 sec. Rotate the sample-bead mixture tubes at these parameters for 30 min at RT.\nRemove unbound antibody after conjugation.\n\t\nFollowing 30 min of rotation at RT, place the tubes back in the magnetic rack for 5 min.",
    "Perform three washes of beads by removing the liquid phase using a micropipette and wash with 500 µl of PBS. After the triple wash, resuspend the beads in 490 µl of casein-PBS and place on the unmagnetized portion of the rack.\nExosome extraction using antibody-coated beads.\n\t\nLabel each tube with targeted sample ID. Pipette a 10 µl sample of serum or saliva into the microcentrifuge tube. Use the pipette to mix the sample and magnetic beads by pipetting several times.\nPlace the tubes with sample and anti-human CD63 antibody beads on rotator and rotate for 2 hr at RT. Use the same rotator parameters as described in step 1.2.\nFollowing 2 hr of sample rotating, perform a triple wash by magnetizing to separate beads from solution, removing liquid phase with micropipette, and resuspending beads in 500 µl of Tris-HCl buffer. The resultant beads are now bound to the exosomes and are ready for the electrical field release and measurement.\n2. Electric Field Induced Released and Measurement of Exosomal Content\nInitial Precoating of Electrode with GADPH Primer\n\t\nApply a plastic well to an electrode array to prevent cross-contamination of the individual electrodes. For this experiment, use a 16-sensor electrode array with each unit electrode in the array consisting of a working, counter, and reference electrode made of bare gold.\nPrepare a stock mixture of 100 nM DNA probe, 0.3 M KCl, and 10 mM pyrrole by pipetting stock reagents into a tube with ultrapure distilled water. Mix thoroughly by vortexing.\n\t\tNOTE: For this study, the DNA probe selected corresponds to the GAPDH reference gene, which is known to exist within exosomes. The probe sequence used is: 5'-Biotin-AGGTCCACCACTGACACGTTG-3'. Use this mixture on all the electrodes.",
    "Pipet 60 µl of the monomer-DNA probe mixture onto the surface of each gold electrode. Examine the electrodes to ensure that there is adequate coverage of the working, counter, and reference electrodes by the liquid mixture.\nElectropolymerize monomer-probe mixture to create a conducting polymer layer on the electrode surface by applying a cyclic square wave (CSW) electric field profile to the electrode surface. This electric field consists of applying +350 mV for 9 sec and immediately switching to +950 mV for 1 sec. Apply this cyclic square wave profile to the electrode for 10 cycles, for a total of 100 sec of applied electric field.\nRinse sensor surface 3 times with distilled water and dry with nitrogen gas to remove liquid from the surface of the electrode. Ensure that liquid is properly removed from the electrode.\nExosome Cargo Unloading\n\t\nLoad 5 µl of 1 µM of a detector probe into 495 µl of the bead-exosome complex mixture and use a pipette to mix.\n\t\tNOTE: The detector probe is a DNA primer sequence conjugated to a fluorescein molecule at the 3' end. The detector probe sequence used for this study corresponds to the GAPDH mRNA found within exosomes. The sequence of the fluorescein conjugated detector probe is: 5'-GCAGTGGGGACACGGAAGGCC-Fluorescein-3'.\nPipette 60 µl of the probe and bead-exosome complex mixture onto a gold electrode surface with a magnet array underneath. This magnet array consists of sixteen 2.54 mm diameter neodymium magnets aligned to correspond to the working electrodes of the sensor. Figure 2A illustrates the placement of the magnets and bead-exosome solution.",
    "Once sample is loaded on the electrode surface, apply 20 cycles of the CSW electric field with 9 sec at -300 mV and 1 sec at +200 mV (200 sec total). The exosomal cargo that is released will hybridize to the primers on the surface of the electrode. If surface markers of the exosome are the subject of investigation, skip this portion of the experiment. Figure 2B illustrates this process.\nWash-off the unbound analytes on the electrode surface by triple rinsing the electrode surface with distilled water. Dry the electrode with nitrogen gas.\nReporter Antibody and Readout\n\t\nAdd 60 µl of 150 unit/ml anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP in 1:1,000 dilution) diluted in Casein/PBS.\nUse an electric-field driven conjugation to complex anti-fluorescein HRP to the probe sandwich. Apply -200 mV for 1 sec and +500 mV for 1 sec for 5 cycles to the electrode surface. Figure 2A shows the capture and detector probe complexes for both a protein and nucleic acid system.\nTriple wash sensor surface using distilled water and dry with nitrogen gas.\nFollowing the wash-off of unbound excess anti-fluorescein antibody, add 60 µl of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. Load this substrate on to each sensor surface using a multichannel pipet.\nPerform amperometric readout of the current by measuring the electrode current at -200 mV for 60 sec using an electrochemical potentiostat capable of simultaneous measurement of 16 channels. Figure 2C is an example of current profile during readout.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52439/52439fig2highres.jpg",
