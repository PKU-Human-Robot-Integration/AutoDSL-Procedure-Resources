  "procedures": [
    "1. Larvae Preparation \nMaintain fly lines of OK6-Gal4, UAS-ChR2 or OK6-Gal4, UAS-NpHR2 in plastic vials containing standard fly food. \nSpread yeast paste containing all-trans retinal (ATR) at appropriate concentrations (1 mM for ChR2, 10 mM for NpHR2 (\"NpHR\" for short) on an apple juice agar plate. \nPick up 2nd or 3rd instar larvae from the vials and put them on the ATR-containing plate. \nRear them at 25 °C in the dark for an appropriate period of time (1 day for ChR2, 2 days for NpHR.) \n2. Microscope Setup\nAttach a CCD camera (XCD-V60, Sony) to a conventional confocal microscope (in our case, FV1000, Olympus) with a C-mount attachment (magnification 0.35x). \nIf there is a shutter along the light path from the objective lens to the CCD camera, which closes during laser scanning, remove it carefully. As this step depends on the microscope setup, contact the microscope manufacturer for technical support, if necessary. \n3. Dissection\nRinse the ATR-fed larvae with water to remove residual food from the body.\nPut the larva on a sylgard coated dish, dorsal side up (the dorsal side has two tracheal tubes running longitudinally, one either side of the dorsal midline). The thickness of the sylgard is about 5mm. \nInsert an insect pin (Austerlitz Insect pins, Φ0.10mm, stainless) into the tail between the tracheal tubes with forceps (#5 Inox, FST by Dumont, Switzerland). The pins, about 10mm long, should be bent or cut to be short enough (~2mm long) to avoid hitting and damaging the surface of the objective lens. Then put the second insect pin into the head of the larva near the mouth hook, black claw-like structure at the anterior end.",
    "Add Ca2+-free normal saline (NaCl 140 mM, KCl 2 mM, MgCl2 6 mM, HEPES-NaOH 5 mM, Sucrose 36 mM (pH7.1)) to keep the larva moist. \nMake a small incision near the tail with micro scissors (MB-50-7, Napox, Japan). \nFrom the incision, make a longitudinal cut along the dorsal midline toward the head. Be careful not to damage the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and axons. \nMake a small incision at the head laterally. \nPlace 4 pins at each corner of the dissected bodywall. The body wall should be stretched enough to visualize a segmental pattern of the body wall, but not too much to hinder peristaltic motion. \nRemove the internal organs except for the brain and the VNC and rinse the sample with Ca2+-free normal saline. \nAdjust the orientation of the ventral nerve cord to be bilaterally symmetric by changing the position and orientation of insect pins on body wall. To fix the position of the ventral nerve cord, insert a pin through tissue between the brain and the mouth hook down to the sylgard.\nReplace the buffer with 2 mM Ca2+ Ringer solution (NaCl 130 mM, KCl 5mM, MgCl2 2mM, CaCl2 2 mM, HEPES-NaOH 5 mM, Sucrose 36 mM (pH7.3)). \n4. Imaging with Laser Illumination\nAttach a 4x dry objective lens (UPlanSApo 4x, NA 0.16, Olympus, Japan) in the confocal microscope and set the larva preparation on the stage.\nObtain a transmission image of the dissected preparation with a red laser (633nm) to locate the ventral nerve cord by confocal microscope. For this scanning, be sure not to use a 488nm or 559nm laser, which induces unwanted stimulation of ChR2 or NpHR, respectively.\nDefine the region of interest (ROI) on the transmission image. Zoomed mode could be useful for detailed determination of the ROI.",
    "Change the filter set of the microscope to illuminate with 488nm or 559nm light. \nIlluminate the preparation with a halogen lamp to visualize the body wall. The preparation can be monitored with a CCD camera attached to the confocal microscope. \nRecord the motion of the body wall and switch the laser beam on and off while monitoring the motion."
