    "Human iPSCs were reprogrammed from the fibroblasts of healthy donors using a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Massachusetts General Hospital and McLean Hospital, and characterized as described in previous studies44,45,46.\nNOTE: Briefly, fibroblasts were reprogrammed to iPSC via mRNA-based genetic reprogramming47. The iPSCs were maintained in stem cell medium (SCM) (see material list) and stored at a density of ~1.2 x 102 cells/mL with 1 mL of SCM, 10 μM with rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor (ROCKi) Y-27632, and 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfide (DMSO), in cryopreserved vials in liquid nitrogen at -160 °C. All of the following procedures below are carried out in a biosafety cabinet unless stated otherwise.\n1. Basement membrane matrix dilution and plate coating\nDilute (1:50) growth factor reduced basement membrane matrix purified from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) without phenol red.\nCoat cell culture plates with the appropriate amount of diluted basement membrane matrix (i.e., 6-well plate = 1mL, 12-well plate = 0.5 mL) and incubate these plates at 37 °C for at least 1 hour.\n2. iPSC maintenance\nNOTE: The maximum confluency per well in a 6-well flat-bottom plate is ~1.2 x 106 cells.\nThaw cryopreserved iPSCs into SCM with 10 μM Y-27632 and plate onto a 6-well plate coated with diluted growth factor reduced basement membrane matrix.\nMaintain iPSCs in SCM with 10 μM Y-27632 for the first 24 hours after thawing. Switch to fresh medium after 24 hours.\nMaintain iPSCs in SCM until cells reach 80-90% confluency before passaging.\n\t\nCalculate how many iPSCs will be needed for differentiation by multiplying desired density for differentiation (15,600 cells/cm2) by the surface area of the well. For a 6-well flat-bottom plate, multiply 15,600 cells/cm2 by 9.6 cm2 for a total of 149,760 cells/well.",
    "To passage, wash the cells with Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBBS). Then, incubate the cells with non-enzymatic ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (see material list) for 5 minutes at 37 °C.\n\t\nUse a cell scraper to gently lift off the cells. Collect cells in fresh SCM.\nPlate cells onto cell culture plates coated with diluted SCM and maintain cells as described in step 2.3 or store them at ~1.2 x 106 cells/mL in 1 mL of SCM, 10 μM Y-27632, and 10% DMSO (v/v) in cryopreserved vials in liquid nitrogen at temperature of -160 °C.\n3. Differentiation of iPSCs to BMECs\nNOTE: Non-enzymatic EDTA separates cells into clumps. Enzymatic EDTA (see Table of Materials) separates cells into single cell suspension. Retinoic acid (RA) should be protected from light.\nWash iPSCs once with Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Saline (DPBS). Incubate with enzymatic EDTA (1 mL for 6-well plate, 0.5 mL for 12-well plate, and 0.25 mL for 24-well plate) for approximately 5 minutes at 37 °C to yield a single cell suspension.\nCollect cells and centrifuge at 300 x g (relative centrifugal force) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Resuspend cell pellets in SCM containing 10 μM Y-27632.\nDetermine cell density using Trypan Blue and automated cell counter or a hemocytometer device. Plate cells at a density of 15,600 cells/cm2 or 149,760 cells/well of a 6-well flat-bottom plate (with a surface area of 9.6 cm2/well) in SCM containing 10 μM Y-27632 for 24 hours.\nInitiate differentiation after 24 hours by changing SCM to E6 medium. Change E6 medium daily for the next 4 days.\nOn day 4 of differentiation, replace E6 medium with hESFM supplemented with diluted (1:200) B27 supplement, 20 ng/mL bFGF, and 10 μM RA. Do not change this medium for the next 48 hours.",
    "Prepare 200 mL of hESFM with diluted (1:200) B27, mix 1 mL of 50x concentrated B27 supplement to 199 mL of hESFM.\nPrepare 20 ng/mL of bFGF by reconstituting 50 μg of bFGF in 250 μL of Tris buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl) to make 200 μg/mL stock solution. Prepare 200 mL of hESFM containing 20 ng/mL bFGF by mixing 20 μL of 200 μg/mL bFGF with 200 mL of hESFM.\nPrepare 10 μM RA by first making a 40 mg/mL of RA stock solution by adding 2.5 mL of DMSO to 100 mg of RA powder. Dilute this concentration to 3 mg/mL to make 10 mM stock solution. Prepare 200 mL of hESFM containing 10 μM RA by mixing 200 μL of 10μM RA in 200 mL hESFM.\n4. Coating collagen IV (COL4) and fibronectin (FN) Matrix for Purification of iPSC-Derived BMEC\nAdd 2 mL of sterile water to 2 mg of FN to make 1 mg/mL FN stock solution. Add 5 mL of sterile water to 5 mg of COL4 to make a 1 mg/mL COL4 stock solution.\n\t\nAllow FN to dissolve for at least 30 minutes at 37 °C and the COL4 to dissolve at room temperature.\nDilute FN stock solution in sterile water to a final concentration of 100 μg/mL and COL4 stock solution to a final concentration of 400 μg/mL.\nCoat the desired plates (6-well plate = 1 mL of COL4/FN solution, 12-well plate = 0.5 mL, 24-well plate= 0.25 mL, and 12-transwell filtered plate = 0.25 mL) with the mixture of 400 μg/mL COL4 and 100 μg/mL FN.\nIncubate plates for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight at 37 °C; for Transwell filtered plates, a minimum of 4 hours is recommended.\n5. Sub-culture and purification of iPSC-Derived BMECs",
    "NOTE: Incubation with enzymatic EDTA may take longer than 15 minutes depending on the confluency of the cells on day 6 of differentiation.\nOn day 6 of differentiation, wash cells twice with DPBS. Incubate with 1 mL of enzymatic EDTA for at least 15 minutes at 37 °C until a single cell suspension is obtained.\nCollect cells via centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Resuspend cell pellets with fresh hESFM with diluted (1:200) B27 supplement, 20 ng/mL bFGF, and 10 μM RA.\nSeed cells onto plates coated with a mixture of 400 μg/mL COL4 and 100 μg/mL FN.

No medium changes are needed after this step.\n6. Sprouting assay\nCollect Day 8 iPSC-derived BMECs and seed them at 100,000 cells/well onto a 24-well flat-bottom plate freshly coated with 200 μL/cm2 of basement membrane matrix.\nTreat these cells with hESFM with diluted (1:200) B27 and 40 ng/mL of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA165).\nObserve cells every 24 hours and change the medium every two days.\n7. Immunocytochemistry (ICC)\nNOTE: ICC is carried out on 24-well flat-bottom plates.\nAfter 48 hours of sub-culturing (day 8), wash cells twice with DPBS. Fix cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 minutes.\nWash cells three times with DPBS, 5 minutes per wash. Pre-block cells for 1 hour at room temperature in DPBS with 5% donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v).",
    "Incubate with primary antibodies: mouse anti-human-PECAM1 (1:100, stock 0.5 mg/mL), rabbit anti-human-TJP1 (1:200, stock 0.53 mg/mL), mouse anti-human-CLDN5 (1:200, stock 0.5 mg/mL), mouse anti-human-OCLN (1:200, stock 0.5 mg/mL), and rabbit anti-human-SLC2A1(1:100, stock 0.2 mg/mL) in DPBS containing 5% donkey serum overnight at 4°C.\n\t\nRinse cells once with DPBS and then wash five times for 5 minutes per wash with DPBS.\nIncubate cells with secondary antibodies: donkey-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (1:200) and donkey-anti-mouse 488 (1:200) in DPBS containing 5% donkey serum for 1 hour.\nFollowing this incubation, add Hoechst 33342 trihydrochloride trihydrate diluted (1:1000) in DPBS for 10 minutes.\n\t\nRemove Hoechst 33342 solution and rinse once with DPBS and wash four times with DPBS for 5 minutes per wash.\nVisualize cells on fluorescence microscopes to look for expression and localization of cell makers.\n8. TEER Measurement and Analysis\nNOTE: Corning 12-Transwell filtered plates are equipped with filters consisting of 1.12 cm2 polyethylene terephthalate membranes and 0.4 micrometer pores. TEER measurements are obtained in technical (3 per well) and biological replicates (3 wells per cell line and/or condition).\n24 hours after sub-culturing (day 7), measure TEER using chopstick electrodes and a voltohmmeter every 24 hours. Refer to voltohmmeter user manual for specific instructions on obtaining measurements.\n\t\nTo measure TEER, charge the voltohmmeter instrument the night before. Lightly wipe the instrument and chopstick electrodes with 70% ethanol before placing them in the safety hood.\nSwitch the power on and calibrate the ohm meter as recommended by the manufacturer.\nPlug in the chopstick electrodes and rinse electrodes with 70% ethanol followed by DPBS.\nPlace the shorter end electrode into the trans-well insert (the apical chamber) and the longer end into the basolateral chamber.\nFirst measure a blank well that is coated with COL4/FN only. Then measure the other wells.",
    "Quickly rinse chopstick electrodes with 70% ethanol followed by DPBS when measuring different conditions (i.e. measuring different cell lines).\nAfter all measurements (in Ω) have been recorded, rinse chopstick electrodes with 70% ethanol and then sterile water. Gently wipe electrode and let it air dry in the safety hood.\nAverage the triplicate TEER values (in Ω) from the blank well and subtract this average value from each raw TEER value by condition.\n\t\nAverage the subtracted values and multiply them by 1.12 cm2 (the surface area of the 12-transwell insert).\nUse transformed values from step 6 to generate the graph showing TEER value and standard errors for each day of TEER measurement.\n9. Efflux Transporter Activity and Analysis\nNOTE: Efflux transporter activity assay is performed on a 24-well flat-bottom plate. Efflux transporters of interest include ABCB1 and ABCC1. It is recommended that each condition should be performed in triplicate with control wells (i.e. blank wells without the respective inhibitors).\nAfter 48 hours of sub-culturing (day 8), incubate cells with 10 μM Valspodar (ABCB1 inhibitor) or 10 μM MK571 (ABCC1 inhibitor) for 1 hour at 37 °C.\n\t\nPrepare 10 mM Valspodar stock by dissolving 5 mg of powder (1214.64 g/mol) in 412 μL of DMSO and dilute to working concentration of 10 μM.
