  "procedures": [
    "1. Preparation and Aging of Flies\nObtain or generate6 a collection of Drosophila mutants that will be used for the genetic screen. Here, ENU-mutagenized lines mapped to the second chromosome and balanced over CyO are used.\nAmplify experimental genotype lines in an incubator set at 25 °C, 12 h light/dark cycle on cornmeal-molasses medium.\nCollect around 20 homozygous progeny between 0-2 days of adult eclosion from each experimental genotype. Eliminate sex bias by consistently collecting either male or female flies.\nAge the flies on cornmeal-molasses medium as desired at 29 °C, flipping the vials every 2-3 days in order to maintain the flies on fresh food as they age. In the screen presented here, flies were aged for 10-12 days.\nAssemble a climbing assay testing chamber using two vials and tape as previously described10. The vials should be connected at both open ends. Use a ruler to mark a 5 cm line on one end of the chamber.\n2. Protocol 1: Climbing Assay (Adapted from Ali et al.10)\nValidate the climbing assay. In this study, test the climbing assay based on previously described methodology by Ali et al.10, using ElavC155>UAS-TauR406W (exhibiting lower climbing pass rates) and ElavC155>UAS-GFP (control) and ElavC155>UAS-mCherry (control) flies.\nFlip the flies into a testing chamber, one line at a time (do not use CO2 anesthesia) and allow them to recover for 5 min. If testing is done on different days, perform the assay at the same time of the day. In this study, all climbing assays were performed in the afternoon to control for circadian effects on locomotion12.\nNOTE: Avoid exposing the flies to direct sunlight when testing; this will interfere with their ability to climb.",
    "Forcibly tap the chamber (marked side down) onto a mouse pad placed on a solid surface 3 times so all flies begin the assay at the bottom. Observe fly locomotion over a period of 10 s.\nRecord the number of flies that reach or pass the 5 cm line within this time, as well as the total number of flies tested. Repeat the protocol, waiting 1 min between each trial, for a minimum of 3 trial replicates per line.\nNOTE: In the present study, each vial contained between 2 and 19 flies for the initial screening (male flies) and between 6 and 21 flies for the mutant deficiency analysis of crossed female lines (Section 5.3.).\n3. Protocol 2: Selection of Drosophila Strains for Further Analysis\nEnter the climbing assay data into Microsoft Excel or similar software and calculate the climbing pass rate for each line over all replicates as a percentage.\nPerform statistical analysis to detect mutant lines that deviate significantly from the mean climbing percent value of all lines using the R software package13.\nRead in data files curated for R (.csv or .txt files with a column for each variable or factor, and rows representing the specific values).\nNOTE: Here, data for males (initial assay) and females (line 867 crossed to deficiency lines) were entered into separate .xlsx sheets as two columns, one where the rows of the column identify the mutant line and how many times the assay was replicated and the other where rows represent the mean climbing success (as a percentage) for each replicate vial of flies.\nRead the data into R using the following code:\n\t\tmali<-read.csv(\"../male_init.csv\")\n\t\tfemdef<-read.csv(\"../fem_def_cross.csv\")",
    "NOTE: The \"..\" in the path directories are absolute paths from the root directory of the user's computer and would need to be specified by the individual user for their computer's directory paths.\nPerform linear modeling\n\t\t\nPerform dummy variable regression with the lm function in R. For the initial analysis of mutant lines, evaluate the significance of factor level effects (mutant lines) on percent climbing success against the grand mean for a zero mean centered response variable (percent success).\nNOTE: The \"-1\" at the end of the lm function call in section 3.2.3.2. removes the intercept and allows us to test all factor levels against the zero mean centered mean of percent climbing pass rate.\nPrint the results to the screen using the R summary function:\n\t\t\tmali_anova<-lm(scale(mali$P_Success)~mali$Mutant_line -1)\n\t\t\tsummary(mali_anova)\nUse control lines (if present) as the baseline to test factor level effects against using the following R code: x<-relevel(femdef$Mutant_line, ref=\"a867_plus\")\n\t\t\tfemdef_anova<-lm(femdef$P_success~x)\n\t\t\tsummary(femdef_anova)\nNOTE: The first line of code reorders the factor levels so that the negative control line becomes the baseline intercept to which all other factor levels (mutant lines) are tested against with the built-in t-tests in the lm function.\nChoose a threshold for candidate lines depending on age at the time of testing. To determine the threshold, perform a preliminary test at the desired age using known mutants that exhibit neurodegeneration and low climbing pass rates in comparison to wild type, control flies10.\nNOTE: A passing rate below 50% may be appropriate for 10 days-old flies as previously reported for Drosophila lines overexpressing the human neurodegeneration-related gene Tau in the nervous system10. Older flies should have a higher passing rate threshold since they are expected to exhibit decreased locomotion, thus, increased neurodegeneration.\n4. Protocol 3: Histology Analysis",
    "Wearing gloves, sever fly heads with a surgical blade following the climbing assay and use a paintbrush to gently place them in 1 mL of Carnoy's fixative (6:3:1 of 100% EtOH: chloroform: glacial acetic acid) in a 1.5 mL micro centrifuge tube O/N at 4 °C. Make sure the heads sink in the fixative solution.\nReplace the fixative solution the following day with 1 mL of 70% EtOH and maintain the samples still at 4 °C for future analysis.\nNOTE: The protocol may be paused at this step.\nPlace the heads from step 4.2. at a maximum of five per microbiopsy cassette. Immediately place the cassettes into a container filled with 70% EtOH. Store the container at 4 °C prior to shipping to a histology facility for processing and paraffin embedding of the heads. If equipment for tissue processing and embedding is available, follow step 4.4.\nEmbed the heads in paraffin for microtome sectioning:\nFollow the program settings for an automated tissue-processing machine in the order presented in Table 1 to dehydrate, clear and infiltrate with paraffin the heads.\nTransfer the samples into metal base molds that fit the cassette using paraffin heated at 60 °C using a paraffin embedding station.\nOrient the heads (antero-posterior orientation facing the top) in the base mold using fine forceps to allow proper visualization of the brain tissue following sectioning. This can be done by reheating the paraffin at 60 °C and repositioning the heads if necessary.\nNOTE: Metal molds can be replaced by disposable base molds.\nPosition the cassette on the top of the corresponding base mold and gently move these to the refrigerated side of the paraffin embedding station (4 °C). Wait until the block hardens prior removing it from the station.",
    "Remove the block form the mold by gently dissociating the mold from the cassette.\nTrim each paraffin block prior sectioning to minimize the surface that will be sectioned.\nSet the microtome to cut 5 µm sections of each block.\nPlace sectioned paraffin ribbon containing the tissue in a heated water bath (35 °C) for a maximum of 5 min.\nImmerse a poly-lysine coated slide (helps to retain the tissue) in the heated water bath, placing the sectioned ribbon on the slide using wood applicators. Let the slides air dry O/N at room temperature.\nHeat the slides for 15 min at 63 °C using a slide warmer.\nPlace the slides on a slide staining rack and stain with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) under a fume hood by respecting the following steps.\nPlace the rack in Histochoice (non-toxic replacement of Xylene, which helps to remove the paraffin from the sample) for 5 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with Histochoice for 5 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with 100% EtOH 1 for 5 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with 100% EtOH 2 for 5 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with 95% EtOH for 3 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with 70% EtOH for 3 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with Distilled H2O for 5 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with Harris Hematoxylin for 2-5 min.\nTake the rack out of the Hematoxylin solution and place it under running tap water for 10 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with distilled water by doing a short dunk.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with Eosin for 1-2 min.",
    "Transfer the rack in a container filled with 95% EtOH by doing a short dunk.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with 95% EtOH for 5 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with 100% EtOH for 5 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with 100% EtOH for 5 min.\nTransfer the rack in a container filled with Histochoice (or Xylene) for 5-10 min until all slides are mounted.\nMount the slide and coverslip (24 mm x 60 mm of size). Using forceps, take the slide out of the Histochoice or Xylene solution and make a thin strip of mounting medium on the top of it. Gently place the coverslip on the top, trying to avoid the formation of bubbles.\nLet the mounting medium on mounted slides harden O/N under the fume hood prior to analysis.\nStore stained slides in a box at room temperature.\nQuantify neurodegeneration by looking at all serial sections on the slide at 20x magnification under a light microscope. Examine the entire brain, taking qualitative note of size and number of vacuoles that appear in three consecutive sections.\nObtain images of representative brain sections at approximately mid-brain using a light microscope equipped with imaging software.\n5. Protocol 4: Gene Mapping of Recessive Mmutant Phenotype\nOutcross the candidate line to a wild type CantonS (BL_ 9517) or another wild type or isogenized strain (e.g., OregonR (BL_ 2376), w1118 (BL_5905) or yw (BL_ 6599) to determine whether the phenotype is dominant or recessive.\n\tNOTE: Results from this step will guide the next steps of the mapping. If the phenotype is recessive, then deficiency mapping can be performed.",
    "Using a paintbrush, make a cross by placing in a food-containing vial CO2-anesthetized flies of the mutant line of interest (5 males) and the CantonS line (10-15 virgin females). Place the vial at 25 °C.\nCollect heterozygous F1 progeny and repeat climbing and histology experiments.\nCompare the obtained results to the control line alone and to the homozygous mutants. A good indication of recessive phenotype will be if heterozygous mutants exhibit similar phenotypes as wild type flies.\nPerform meiotic mapping to roughly estimate the location of the mutation on the second chromosome using the wgSp-1 J1 L2 Pin1/CyO (BL_3227) or an equivalent strain with associated dominant markers at known cytological location. In this case, the mutation was previously known to be located on the second chromosome.\nUsing a paintbrush, make a cross by placing in a food-containing vial CO2-anesthetized flies of the mutant line of interest (5 males) and the wgSp-1 J1 L2 Pin1/CyO line (10 females). Place the vial at 25 °C.\nNOTE: The goal of this cross is to generate heterozygous females carrying the chromosome with the new mutation and the marker chromosome, which will recombine during meiosis6,14. Female F1 progeny are chosen rather than males since recombination does not occur in males.\nCollect at least 15 virgin female progeny carrying the chromosome with the new mutation and the marker chromosome and cross them to 5 males from a balanced line that carries another visible dominant marker (e.g., CyO/snaSco (BL_2555) or equivalent).\nCollect heterozygous male progeny carrying either Sco or CyO and the potentially recombined chromosome from the cross in step 5.2.2. and individually mate them to virgin females from the stock carrying the mutated chromosome.",
    "Collect the progeny from final cross described in step 5.2.3. and age the flies at 29 °C (in this study flies were aged for 10-14 days).\nCollect heads, perform histology analysis as described in Protocol 3 and look at the slides with brain sections to determine the degree of neuropathology as described in step 4.11. Histology analysis is performed rather than locomotion analysis due to phenotypes that may affect the climbing assay, such as Jammed (J), which causes fluid buildup in the wings15.\nPerform deficiency mapping on narrowed region of the chromosome to refine the location of the recessive mutation using the climbing assay. Each deficiency line has a deletion of different region of the chromosomes, allowing them to be used for complementation testing.\nStart with large deficiencies that span the region identified in the meiotic mapping, which can then be further narrowed down by the use of smaller deficiencies. If the deficiency analysis results in more than one candidate gene, the use of RNA interference (RNAi) stocks are recommended to target them.\nCross lines from the Drosophila deficiency kit16 for the second chromosome (DK2L in this study) and look for non-complementation of the phenotype of interest (in this study: climbing pass rate of 8.5% which corresponds to the pass rate of homozygous flies from line 867 used as positive control).\nConfirm the neurodegeneration phenotype using histology verification as described in Section 4 (Protocol 3).\n6. Protocol 5: DNA Sequencing and Analysis\nNOTE: Keep in mind that ENU mutagenesis introduces point mutations11.\nDesign forward and reverse primer sequences flanking the exon-coding region of the brat gene for amplification by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of the region of interest (in the case of line 867 a DNA fragment of the size of 3,247 bp is amplified for sequencing17).",
    "Extract DNA from a single fly18 :\nGently squish the fly in a 0.5 mL micro centrifuge tube containing 50 µL of Squishing buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.2, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl, and 200 µg/mL Proteinase K; the enzyme has to be diluted fresh from a frozen stock prior each use) using a P100 or P200 pipet tip.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C\nDeactivate the Proteinase K by placing the tube at 95 °C for 2 min.\nNOTE: The extracted DNA can be stored at 4 °C for several months.\nPerform the PCR reaction using a high-fidelity DNA Taq Polymerase (reagents and thermal cycling conditions used in this study are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively) by respecting manufacturer's instructions and run the PCR product on a 1% agarose gel containing Invitrogen SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain, which is a non-toxic alternative of Ethidium bromide.\nExcise the band of the correct size from the gel with a scalpel and purify the PCR product using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega) or equivalent kit, by respecting manufacturer's instructions.\nDesign forward and reverse primers that will be used for DNA sequencing in order to cover the entire region of interest, if possible. Sequence the gel-purified DNA from the previous step to identify point mutations. High accuracy in automated fluorescent Sanger sequencing could be achieved for up to 700 bp.\nNOTE: The Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa) can be used to amplify PCR products from genomic DNA templates up to 20 kb of size.",
    "Analyze obtained DNA sequences using the A plasmid Editor (ApE, by M. Wayne Davis) or similar software by aligning them and comparing them to the sequences obtained following sequencing of the same genomic region of a reference strain (e.g., originally mutagenized line).\nOpen sequencing files with ApE. As reference, use an ApE file containing the genomic consensus sequence of the brat gene downloaded in a FASTA format from Flybase, or a file containing results for sequence of genetic background control (e.g., originally mutagenized Drosophila line).\nGo to Tools, then Align sequences. Using the computer's mouse, select all sequences to compare. Remember to indicate the reference sequence used for this alignment in the drop menu.\nInspect the sequenced region for nucleotide changes in comparison with the reference sequence. If desired, save the alignment on the computer in .rtf format by clicking on Text, then Save.\nNOTE: If no mutations were identified, the DNA sequencing and analysis protocol would be repeated with primers designed to include non-coding regions of the gene.\n7. Protocol 6: Further Analysis of Candidate Gene Function\nPerform rescue experiments in neuroblasts to determine whether the gene brat is responsible for the neurodegeneration phenotype.\nDouble balance a UAS-brat19 and a neuroblast-specific worniu-Gal4 (wor-G4) stocks carrying the constructs on the third chromosome, as well as the 867 line, which is mutant for the gene brat located on the second chromosome.\n\t\t\nMake three separate crosses by placing in three different food-containing vials 5 males from UAS-Brat, wor-G4 and 867 lines and add to each set of males 10-15 virgin females from a line carrying markers and balancers for the second and third chromosomes (Sp/CyO; Dr/Tm3,sb; BL_59967).",
    "Collect 10-15 virgin females from the F1 of each cross with the following genotypes: +/CyO; UAS-brat/Tm3,sb, +/CyO; wor-G4/Tm3,sb and 867/CyO;+/Tm3,sb and 5 males of each of the following genotypes: +/Sp;UAS-brat/Tm3,sb, +/Sp; wor-G4/Tm3,sb and 867/CyO; +/Dr.\nCross collelcted +/CyO; UAS-brat/Tm3,sb virgin females to +/Sp; UAS-brat/Tm3,sb males; in a separate vial make a second cross with +/CyO; wor-G4 /Tm3,sb virgin females to +/Sp; wor-G4/Tm3,sb males and then in a third vial cross 867/CyO;+/Tm3,sb virgin females and 867/CyO; +/Dr males.\nFrom the F1 of each of these crosses, collect both males and females of the following genotypes: Sp/CyO; UAS-brat/Tm3,sb from the first cross, Sp/CyO; wor-G4/Tm3,sb from the second cross and 867/CyO; Dr/Tm3,sb from the second cross.\nPerform a final cross between brothers and sisters collected from each F1 progeny to establish permanent double balanced stocks for all three lines.\nCombine UAS-brat and wor-G4 with the 867 mutation.\n\t\t\nCollect sufficient number (~20-30 flies) of virgin females from the 867/CyO; Dr/Tm3,sb double balanced stock to perform two crosses.\nPlace 10-15 virgin females with ~5 males from the Sp/CyO; UAS-brat/Tm3,sb (cross #1) and in a second vial 10-15 virgin females with ~5 Sp/CyO; wor-G4/Tm3,sb males.\nCollect brothers and sisters from the F1 of each cross with the following genotypes: 867/CyO; UAS-brat/Tm3,sb from cross #1 and 867/CyO;wor-G4/Tm3,sb from cross #2. Use collected F1 progeny from each cross to establish permanent stocks by crossing brothers and sisters between them.\nNOTE: Following this final step, stocks for 867/CyO; UAS-brat/Tm3,sb and 867/CyO; wor-G4/Tm3,sb should be generated.\nPerform the rescue experiment.\n\t\t\nCollect ~15-20 virgin females from the 867/CyO; wor-G4/Tm3,sb stock and cross them to 5-10 males from the stock 867/CyO; UAS-brat/Tm3,sb. As control, cross ~15-20 virgin females from the 867/CyO; wor-G4/Tm3,sb and ~15-20 virgin females from the 867/CyO; UAS-brat/Tm3,sb line to the 867/CyO line alone.",
    "NOTE: 867 flies carry a temperature-sensitive allele of brat and the rescue cross should be performed at 29 °C.\nCollect the following F1 progeny from each cross by carefully selecting away marked balancers: 867/867; wor-G4/UAS-brat (rescue), 867/867; wor-G4/+ (control) and 867/867; UAS-brat/+ (control).\nAge the flies as desired at 29 °C and perform histology analysis on brains to look for neurodegeneration by using the protocol described in Section 4 (Protocol 3).\nPerform age-dependent analysis of neurodegeneration in 867 mutants.\nCollect 867;pcna-GFP and yw control flies, which carry a reporter gene (pcna-GFP) and are viable at 25°C and exhibit both higher penetrance and higher expressivity of the neurodegeneration phenotype than 867 alone at this temperature17.\nAge the flies up to 5, 15 and 25 as described in Section 1.4 and perform subsequent histology analysis by following the protocol in Section 4 (Protocol 3).\nSubscription Required.
