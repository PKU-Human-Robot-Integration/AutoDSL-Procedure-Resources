    "Note: All animal work must be carried out according to institutional and animal care guidelines.\n1. Preparation of Animal and Labeling\nAnesthetize rats: Anesthetize a rat (typically 150-400 g) using an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (50 mg/kg body weight), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg). Check for reflexes by pinching the foot, wait till there is no response. Since the anesthesia response varies between animals, it is best to determine the effect of the anesthetics by testing pain reflexes.\nDiI Solution: Weigh DiI powder and dissolve in sterile 100% DMSO to achieve a 1.5% solution (15 mg/ml). Store the solution at room temperature in a dry atmosphere until use.\nDiI Injections: shave the hair over the calf area on both legs of the anesthetized rat using an electric razor.\n\t\nFill a 1 ml sterile syringe (1¼ in 27 G needle) with 200 µl of 1.5% DiI solution. Slowly insert the needle parallel to the long-axis of each gastrocnemius muscle, and inject 100 µl DiI into the muscle while slowly backing the needle out of the muscle (~10 sec) without withdrawing from the muscle.\nPrior to withdrawing the needle from the muscle, pull back on the syringe plunger to ensure the dye no longer flows from the tip, wait 10 sec, and then withdraw the needle from the muscle. This step prevents the leakage of DiI from the needle onto the skin, which could label cutaneous afferents.\nRepeat for other leg.\nAllow 4-5 days for the DiI to be transported from muscle to the DRG.\n2. Dissection and Neuronal Isolation\nSolutions:\n\t\nPrepare Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) according to manufacturer’s instructions, filter sterilize and store at 4 °C.",
    "Culture media (MEM Plus): Mix 89 ml minimal essential media (MEM), 10 ml fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 ml penicillin-streptomycin solution, filter sterilize and store at 4 °C.\nPolylysine solution: dissolve poly-L-lysine hydrobromide powder (10 mg/100 ml) in 0.1 M sodium borate solution, pH 8.4, filter sterilize and store aliquots at -20 °C.\nCoating coverslips\n\t\nClean the glass coverslips (12 mm round) in 70% ethanol for 3-4 hr and air dry in sterile culture hood.\nPlace the dried coverslips in the polylysine solution O/N.\nRemove from polylysine solution and wash in sterile distilled water 2x for 5 min each to remove any excess polylysine.\nSeparate the coverslips, dry in culture hood, and store at 4 oC.\nSetting up for dissection\n\t\nPlace on ice a beaker with 10 ml HBSS, a 35 mm Petri dish and a 100 mm Petri dish.\nWeigh out enzymes: 7 mg collagenase, 1 mg of DNAse and 10 mg of trypsin.\nPreheat a shaking water bath to 37 oC and place into the bath a 15 ml centrifuge tube containing 10 ml of EBSS to warm up.\nDissection:\n\t\nSacrifice rat according to an IACUC approved protocol. Carbon dioxide was used to euthanize the rat.\nQuickly remove the back by cutting open the skin on the back, remove the connective and muscle tissue along the spinal column for better exposure and remove the lumbar section of the vertebral column (end of the thoracic region to the iliac bone; Figure 1).\nPlace the isolated vertebral column into the 100 mm Petri dish, and using a sterile Pasteur pipette apply chilled HBSS solution to keep the preparation moist and cold.\nCut the muscles from the sides of the vertebral column. Perform a dorsal laminectomy, using rongeurs or scissors, and gently remove the bone enclosing the recesses containing the DRG.",
    "Repeatedly apply ice cold HBSS (~1 ml) during this procedure.\nIsolate the DRG by cutting the peripheral and central nerves (leaving 1-2 mm of nerve to facilitate handling of the ganglia)\nPlace the isolated DRG into the 35 mm Petri dish containing ice-cold HBSS buffer.\nRepeat until all L-4 and L-5 DRG have been isolated. Thoracic DRG can be isolated and processed separately as a negative control for DiI labeling.\nPlace the dish with isolated DRG under a dissection microscope and remove the excess nerves and blood vessels using micro scissors and forceps.\nCut open the DRG for better exposure to the enzymes, but do not desheath the DRG.\nDRG neuron dissociation:\n\t\nAdd the enzymes into the warm EBSS media (kept in the water bath). Shake briefly to dissolve, and filter sterilize.\nUsing a sterile Pasteur pipette, place all DRG into the enzyme solution. Minimize the volume of HBSS that is added with DRG since the HBSS will dilute the enzyme mixture.  Gas the flask with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for 60 sec before tightly capping the flask.\nIncubate the flask in the shaking water bath set at 37 °C for 60 min at 240 rpm.\nAt the end of incubation, vigorously shake the flask 50x to dissociate the DRG5.\nUnder sterile conditions, add 5 ml of MEM Plus to the flask to stop the enzymes.\nTransfer flask contents to a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 16 x g for 6 min.\nRemove and discard the supernatant, add 5 ml of MEM Plus to the sample. Triturate gently with pipette to break up the pellet.\nRepeat centrifugation step, remove and discard the supernatant and add 500 µl of MEM Plus. Gently triturate with a 1 ml pipette tip on a pipette to make a cell suspension.",
    "Place one poly-lysine coated glass coverslip into an empty sterile 35 mm dish. Add a drop (~50 µl) of the cell suspension to the center of the coverslip.\nRepeat until cell solution is exhausted.\nPlace the 35 mm dishes into a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator for 1 hr to allow the neurons to adhere to the coverslips.\nAdd an additional 2 ml of media into each dish and return to the incubator.\n3. Patch Clamp Recording\nSolutions for recording: these solutions are for recording NaV currents. Examples of solutions with differing composition can be found in these references5-7.\n\t\nExternal solution: (in mM) 45 NaCl, 100 N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMG)•Cl, 4 MnCl2, 10 Na•HEPES and 10 glucose, with pH = 7.4 and osmolarity = 320 mOsm.\nInternal solution: (in mM) 104 NMG•Cl, 14 Creatine•PO4, 6 MgCl2, 10 NMG•HEPES, 5 Tris•ATP, 10 NMG2•EGTA, and 0.3 Tris2•GTP with pH 7.4 and osmolarity = 300 mOsm.\nMeasurement of ionic currents:\n\t\nPull recording electrodes from glass capillaries on an electrode puller and heat-polish the tips using a microforge. The resistance of the electrodes is typically 2-3 MΩ\nIdentify the DiI labeled DRG neurons using a microscope with epifluorescence and a TRITC cube. DiI has an excitation wavelength of 550 nm and emission wavelength of 570 nm.\nFill the glass electrode with internal solution (only filing ~ 1 cm of the electrode tip) and gently tap to remove any trapped bubbles. Place in electrode holder and move to cell using a micromanipulator.\nOnce the electrode touches the cell, apply gentle suction via the suction tube, until a tight seal is formed ( determined by the increase in electrode resistance).\nClamp the membrane voltage at the desired holding potential (typically -60 to -120 mV).",
    "Obtain the whole-cell patch clamp configuration by applying stronger suction to remove the membrane patch at the tip of the electrode. The transition to whole-cell configuration is observed electrically as an increase in capacitative current8-10.\nCompensate the series resistance using the compensation circuitry of the patch clamp amplifier (use at least 80% compensation)8,10.\n4. Immunocytochemistry\nFix the neurons on the coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr and then permeabilize with 2% Tween 20 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min.\nIncubate the fixed cells O/N in a blocking solution (normal serum or Bovine Serum Albumin) plus the primary antibody, which is an antibody developed to bind to a specific antigen of interest.\nIncubate a control set of neurons O/N in blocking solution that lacks the primary antibodies.\nWash the coverslips with PBS buffer 3x for 5 min followed by 2 washes of 5 min each with 1% Tween 20 to remove unbound primary antibody.\nIncubate test and control coverslips with the appropriate fluorescent tagged secondary antibody, which binds to the primary antibody to permit visualization.\nWash the coverslips with PBS 3x for 5 min to remove excess secondary antibody.\nMount the coverslips on a clean glass slide using mounting media.\nApply clear nail polish to edge of the coverslip to fix it place. Once dry, visualize the neurons and capture images using the software accompanying the fluorescence microscope.\n\tNote: In this work, a Nikon Microscope was used with NIS-elements BR 3.2 software. The exposure time was optimized and kept the same for control and test slides.\nMeasure fluorescence intensity and cell size from individual neurons using imaging software such as ImageJ (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html).\nSubscription Required.
