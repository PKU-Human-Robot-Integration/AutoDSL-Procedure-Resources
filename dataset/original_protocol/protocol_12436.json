Habituation\nMeasure response decrement to repeated presentations of a light, rattle and bell.\nRecord the number of trials it takes the infant to stop responding to each stimulus.\n3. Unwrap and Supine\nUnwrap and undress the infant and place in supine position.\nPosture: Record the infant’s posture as total extension, partial flexion, total flexion, or abnormal.\nSkin Color: Record skin color as normal, pallid, cyanotic or mottled.\nSkin Texture: Record any of the following skin texture signs that are observed: shedding or peeling, excoriations, loose skin or deep creases around eyes and nose.\nMovement: Record baseline motor activity as very little or none, normal or excessive.\nResponse decrement to foot stimulation: Record the number of trials it takes the infant to stop responding to press of the heel.\n4. Lower Extremity Reflexes\nPlace infant supine and hold infant’s leg just below the knee with the leg relaxed.\nPlantar grasp: Press thumb against ball of infants’ foot.\nRecord as no response, weak, normal or exaggerated.\nBabinski reflex: Scratch lateral side of infant’s foot.\nRecord as no response, weak, normal or exaggerated.\nAnkle clonus: dorsiflex the ball of the infant’s foot several times.\nRecord as no clonus, one, two or more, or sustained beats.\nRepeat plantar grasp, Babinski reflex and ankle clonus with opposite leg.\nLeg resistance and recoil: Hold both feet of infant’s legs near the ankles with one hand with your index finger between the feet. Fully flex hips and knees and then extend thighs and legs and release.",
    "Record resistance to extension as none, little, moderate or strong and note speed and amount of thigh and lower leg recoil.\nPower of Active Leg Movements: grasp the infant’s moving foot above the ankle between your index and middle fingers and apply gentle resistance.\nRecord active movements against gravity as none, minimal, moderate, or strong.\nPopliteal Angle: Grasp the bottom of the infant’s heel with your fingers. In one fluid motion bring the infant’s knee to his belly and then extend leg. Repeat with the infant’s other leg.\nRecord the angle formed at the knee by the upper and lower leg for Left and Right leg.\n5. Upper Extremity Reflexes and Face\nScarf sign: Place the infant’s arm just above the chest with one hand. Place your other hand on the infant’s trunk to prevent trunk rotation with your thumb at the infant’s elbow. Gently push the elbow across the chest so that the arm comes across the neck like a scarf. Repeat with the infant’s other arm.\nRecord the point on the chest to which the elbow moves easily prior to significant resistance.\nForearm resistance and recoil: Hold both infant’s arms at the wrist and fully flex arms at the elbow. Extend forearms and release one arm in 1 sec and the other arm 1 sec later.\nRecord amount of forearm resistance and speed and amount of recoil.\nPower of Active Arm Movements: grasp the wrist of the moving hand between your index and middle fingers and apply gentle resistance to the infant’s movement.\nRecord active movements against gravity as none, minimal, moderate, or strong.\nRooting: With one hand hold the infant’s hands against his or her chest. With the other hand, stroke the skin at the corners of the infant’s mouth.",
    "Record response as none, turn away from, weak, full or exaggerated head turn toward stimulated side.\nGrasp of Hands: Place index finger in the palm of the infant’s hand and press the palmar surface without touching the back of the hand. Repeat with the infant’s other hand.\nRecord response as none, weak, strong or prolonged.\nTruncal Tone: Place one hand under the infant’s buttocks and hold the back of the infant’s head at the neck with the other hand. Lift the infant a few inches above the surface of the crib so that the buttocks do not touch the surface. Gently flex the infant’s trunk by bringing the head forward and bringing the infant to a sitting position.\nRecord the tone of the trunk as no tone, some tone, good tone or exaggerated tone.\nPull to Sit: Hold the infant’s wrists/forearms with your hands. With the infant’s arms extended, pull the infant to a seated position.\nAs infant is pulled to sit, observe if there is muscular resistance to stretching the neck and if the infant attempts to right head into a position that is in midline of the trunk and parallel to the body.\n6. Upright Responses\nPlacing: Hold the infant upright with both hands under the arms and around the chest. Use your thumbs to support movement of the infant’s head. Lift the infant so that the top of the foot is stroked and gently pressed downward against an edge on the crib or tabletop. Repeat with the other foot.\nObserve if foot is lifted and then extends to “place”.",
    "Stepping: Hold the infant upright with both hands under the arms and around the chest. Use your thumbs to support movement of the infant’s head. Let the soles of the feet touch the surface and move the infant forward as stepping occurs.\nRecord response as none, some, clear or exaggerated stepping. If stepping was not elicited, note if infant can support weight, legs stiffen or if feet cross in a scissoring pattern.\nVentral Suspension: Over the crib, suspend the infant in the air in a prone position by placing a hand under the infant’s chest and abdomen.\nRecord final position of infant’s head, limbs and trunk.\nIncurvation: Slowly tap or stroke a line with the side of your thumb a few centimeters from the vertebrae, downward from the shoulder to the buttocks. Repeat on the other side.\nRecord response of trunk as it flexes laterally in a concave curve on the stimulated side as none, weak, fully developed or exaggerated.\n7. Infant Prone\nCrawling: Both 7.1 and 7.3 are scored from the following maneuver. With infant prone, place head in midline and arms near the head, palms down. If infant does not crawl spontaneously, stimulate the response by gently pressing your palms on the soles of the feet.\nRecord response as none, weak, coordinated or prolonged crawling and whether stimulation was applied.\nHead Raise in Prone: From above position, record lifting of the head as none, head turning, brief lift, sustained lift, or exaggerated response such as hyperextended neck.\n8. Pick up Infant\nCuddle in Arm: Hold the infant in a cuddled position in your arms. Do not rock or talk to infant. Facilitate cuddling only if there is no active participation from the infant.\nCuddle on Shoulder: Hold the infant in a cuddled position on your shoulder.",
    "Record infant’s ability to relax or mold, nestle, and cling as well as any resistance to cuddling.\n9. Orientation/Attention\nAdminister the orientation items as you sit in a chair with the infant resting on your lap. Have the infant at a slight upward angle.\nInanimate Visual: Hold the red ball approximately 10-12 inches from the infant’s eyes. Jiggle the ball to find the infant’s focal range. Then, slowly move the ball horizontally from one side to the other. If the eyes and head follow to at least one side, move the ball vertically and in an arc to see if the infant will continue to follow.\nInanimate Visual and Auditory: Gently shake the red rattle approximately 10-12 inches from the infant’s eyes. Slowly move the rattle horizontally from one side to the other. If the eyes and head follow to at least one side, move the rattle vertically and in an arc to see if the infant will continue to follow.\nAnimate Visual: Place your face 12-18 inches in front of the infant’s face. Slowly move from one side to the other. If the eyes and head follow to at least one side, move your face vertically and in an arc to see if the infant will continue to follow.\nAnimate Visual and Auditory: Speak in a soft, slightly higher pitched voice, with your face 12-18 inches in front of the infant’s face. Slowly move from one side to the other. If the eyes and head follow to at least one side, move your face vertically and in an arc to see if the infant will continue to follow.\nFor 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4, record infants ability to become alert, focus on the object, follow with eyes and head horizontally or vertically and to coordinate head and eye movements.",
    "Inanimate Auditory: Shake the rattle continuously, 6-12 inches from the infant’s ear and out of sight. Repeat so there are two trials on each side.\nAnimate Auditory: Speak softly into one of the infant’s ears with your face out of the infant’s line of vision, about 6-12 inches away. Repeat so there are two trials on each side.\nFor 9.6 and 9.7, record infant’s ability to become alert, turn and/or look toward the stimulus.\n10. Infant Spin\nTonic Deviation of the Head and Eyes: Hold the infant upright facing you with both hands under the arms, your thumbs across the chest and fingers around the infant’s back. Use your fingers to support the base of the head. Rotate your trunk in a half circle. Rotate in the other direction.\nObserve the infant’s eye/head movements and presence/absence of nystagmus.\n11. Infant Supine in Crib\nDefensive Movements: With infant’s head in midline, hold a small cloth in place over the infant’s eyes and nose but not occluding the nostrils.\nRecord activity level of infant as well as presence of nondirected/directed swipes of arms toward the cloth.\nAsymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex (ATNR): Turn the infant’s face slowly to one side and hold briefly in that position with the jaw over the shoulder. Wait for the infant to settle and make a postural adjustment. Repeat on the other side.\nRecord amount of extension of the infant’s arm and leg on the face side.\nMoro Reflex: Over the crib, hold the infant supine in your hands with one hand under the head and the other hand supporting the back and buttocks. While continuing to support the head, quickly lower the infant.\nRecord the abduction and adduction of the infant’s arms.\n12. Stress/Abstinence\nScore each sign of stress/abstinence as yes if present during the exam.",
    "Summary Items\nThroughout the exam, observe and record the following: quality of infant’s alertness and responsiveness, general tone, motor maturity, consolability maneuvers required, level of arousal, irritability, spontaneous and elicited activity, amount of tremors and startles, lability of skin color and state, predominate state, hand to mouth efforts and self-quieting efforts.\nSummary Scores\nAnalysis of the NNNS is based on previously established summary scores1 or scales measuring habituation, attention, need for handling, quality of movement, self-regulation, non-optimal reflexes, asymmetric reflexes, arousal, hypertonicity, hypotonicity, excitability, lethargy, and stress/abstinence. The requisite psychometric properties of these scales have been well documented including inter-examiner reliability, internal consistency, discriminant, construct, and predictive validity1 including norms for healthy term infants.6, 7 The summary scores have also been consolidated into profiles or typologies (described below) that classify infants into discrete categories.8-10"
