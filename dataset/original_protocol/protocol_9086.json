  "procedures": [
    "1. Cell Culture\nCulture neuronal cells and treat them as needed.\nHarvest cells into 15 ml tubes: aspirate media, rinse with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, calcium and magnesium free), add trypsin, collect in 15 ml tubes and neutralize trypsin with appropriate serum containing media.\nSpin at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate media.\nResuspend cells in PBS.\nSpin at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate media and resuspend cells in fresh PBS.\nCount cells using a hemacytometer or your preferred cell counter.\nCell samples should be prepared immediately before starting the assay.\nAll samples should be handled in the dark or yellow light to prevent DNA damage from ultraviolet light.\n2. Comet Assay\n1. Slide Preparation\nMelt 1% agarose (1 g / 100 ml in 1X Tris Base, Boric acid, EDTA, TBE) in a microwave for 3 min until all granules disappear.\nDip slides into the molten agarose and wipe a side clean with a kimwipe. Allow the agarose to air-dry to a transparent film. This can be done in advance and slides can be stored.\n2. Neutral Comet Assay\nChill lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA pH 10, 10 mM Tris Base, 1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 10) at 4 °C for at least 1 hr before use.\n2.2.2. Melt 1% low melting point agarose (1 g / 100ml in 1X Tris Base, Boric acid, EDTA) in a microwave for 3 min until all granules disappear. The agarose needs to be cooled to 37 °C in a water bath to avoid artificial induction of comet tail. Ideally, the agarose needs to be cooled for half an hour before use.",
    "2.2.3. Dilute the cell suspension so that there are 100,000 cells per ml. Combine the cell suspension with the low melting point agarose (at 37 °C) at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v), vortex briefly, and immediately pipette 50 μl onto the Comet Slide. Use the side of the pipette tip to spread the cell suspension evenly over the sample area. Each treatment group should be at least in triplicate.\nPlace slides flat in refrigerator for 30 min until a circle appears in the periphery of the slide.\nPrechill the lysis solution and submerge slides in this solution for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C (or in a refrigerator).\nPour off or aspirate the lysis solution and add 1X neutral electrophoresis buffer (Tris base, Boric acid, EDTA, 1X TBE). Leave slides in this buffer for half an hour in the refrigerator.\nAdd prechilled 1X Neutral Electrophoresis Buffer (TBE) in electrophoresis chamber, place slides in electrophoresis slide tray. Align slides so that they are equidistant from electrodes.\nPour 1X neutral electrophoresis buffer up to 0.2 inches above slides. Excess buffer will interfere with electrophoresis.\nSet power supply voltage to 1 V per cm (measured electrode to electrode) and run for 30 min at 4 °C (or the cold room) in the dark.\n3. Alkaline Comet Assay\nChill lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA pH 10, 10 mM Tris Base, 1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 10) at 4 °C for at least 1 hr before use.\nMelt 1% low melting point agarose (1 g / 100 ml in 1X Tris Base, Boric acid, EDTA) in a microwave for 3 min until all granules disappear. Then cool in a 37 °C water bath for at least 30 min.",
    "Combine cells at 1 x 105 / ml with molten low melting point agarose (at 37 °C) at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v), vortex briefly, and immediately pipette 50 μl onto the Comet Slide. Use the side of the pipette tip to spread the cell suspension evenly over the sample area. Each treatment group should be at least in triplicate.\nPlace slides flat in refrigerator for 30 min until a circle appears in the periphery of the slide.\nImmerse slides in prechilled lysis solution and leave at 4 °C for 1 hr to overnight in the dark.\nRemove the slides from the lysis solution, drain the slides and rinse once with cold neutralization buffer for 5 min to remove residual detergent and salts prior to the alkali-unwinding step.\nPlace slides in a gel electrophoresis chamber filled with prechilled freshly made electrophoresis Buffer (300 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH>13) not to exceed 0.5 cm above slides. Align slides so that they are equidistant from electrodes.\nLet slides sit in the alkaline buffer for 30 min in the dark to allow for unwinding of the DNA and the expression of alkali-liable damage.\nSet power supply voltage to 1 V per cm (measured electrode to electrode) and run for 30 min at 4 °C (or the cold room).\n4. Fixing and Staining Cells\nDrain excess Electrophoresis Buffer\nImmerse slides in pre-chilled distilled water for 5 min at RT.\nImmerse slides in pre-chilled 70% ethanol for 5 min at RT.\nDry samples overnight. Do not expose slides to bright light. Samples may be stored for months at room temperature prior to scoring at this stage.\nStain slides by immersing in Sybr green (1X diluted in PBS) for 20 min in the refrigerator.",
    "Remove slides and allow them to dry completely in the dark. The agarose will become transparent when completely dry.\n4. Image Acquisition and Analysis\nAcquire images using fluorescent microscope set to the green filter (Zeiss AxioVision) and analyze using Comet Assay software (Perceptive Instruments).\nClick on the \"comet head\" (the nucleus) and the software calculates the parameters including the mean tail moment and amount of DNA in the nucleus.\nAnalyze at least 200 cells per treatment.\nExport data to Microsoft Excel.\nCalculate mean tail moment for each treatment group and plot data as appropriate.\n5. Representative Results\nAn example of comet assay analysis on neuronal cells is shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. In this case, irradiation of the neuronal cells induces DNA damage. As the cells are subjected to the electrical field, the DNA migrates at different rates due to differences in size which is subsequently analyzed using the Comet Assay software. The more the DNA damage, the farther the DNA migrates out of the nucleus. This decreases the fluorescent intensity in the nucleus which is subsequently picked up by the software and results in higher tail moment. Table 1 depicts a representative table from comet assay analysis and Figure 4 shows a representative graph comparing DNA damage in neuronal cells following radiation as measured by the comet assay.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50049/50049fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Representative graph obtained by plotting the mean tail moment obtained by analyzing DNA damage in irradiated and non-irradiated neuronal cells using neutral comet assay. As expected, 3Gy radiation (x-ray) induces DNA damage as depicted by the higher mean tail moment in the irradiated neuronal cells.
