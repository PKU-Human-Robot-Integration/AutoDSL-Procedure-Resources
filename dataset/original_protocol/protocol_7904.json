    "All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at University of California, Irvine.\n1. Preparation for the heat-induced seizure assay\nSwitch on the Power On button on the heat chamber, followed by the Heat On button.\nSet the temperature of the heat chamber at 50 °C using the keypad on the digital temperature controller.\nWait for a minimum of 1 h to preheat the chamber at 50 °C before introducing the first mouse into the chamber. Preheating ensures uniform heating inside the chamber.\nLine the floor of the mouse heat chamber with cob bedding.\nMount a video recording camera in front of the heat chamber for recording each heat-induced seizure assay trial.\nLine a 140 mm diameter Petri dish with thick layers of tissue paper and place it on ice to serve as a cooling pad.\n\t​NOTE: At the end of the assay, individual mouse will be transferred on the prechilled cooling pad to help bring down their elevated body temperature.\n2. Preparing the mouse for heat-induced seizure assay\nSelect 10 adult mice (P30-P40), 5 that carry the epilepsy causing mutation and 5 of the wild-type litter mates for heat-induced seizure screening assay.\n\tNOTE: Wild-type mice, not harboring any epilepsy causing mutation do not exhibit heat-induced seizures at temperatures below 44 °C and serve as the control group.\nWeigh each mouse to be used for the screening assay and record its body weight. Only mice weighing 15 g or more should be used for the assay.\nScreen one mouse at a time in the mouse heat chamber.\nBriefly anesthetize the mouse for 10-15 s using a few drops of isoflurane at the bottom of a bell jar.",
    "Take the animal out of the bell jar and place it on a paper towel.\nEnsure that the mouse is completely anesthetized by checking that the mouse is unresponsive to a noxious toe pinch.\nCoat the metal tip of the rectal temperature probe with a lubricant (such as petroleum jelly) and gently insert it into the mouse at a depth of less than or equal to 2 cm.\nSecure the rectal probe to the mouse's tail with tape, so the probe does not come out during the assay.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, place the animal in a mouse restrainer cone and insert the rectal temperature probe. Secure it by taping to the tail.\nEnsure the rectal probe is connected to a multimeter that displays internal body temperature of the mouse.\nPlace the animal in a fresh cage lined with cob bedding, i.e., the recovery cage.\nStart a timer and wait for 5 min. Observe the mouse until it has completely recovered from anesthesia and the mouse is active and grooming.\n\t\nSimultaneously, monitor the core body temperature of the mouse till it stabilizes at 35-36 °C.\nAt the end of 5 min, note the body temperature of the mouse. This is the initial body temperature at time \"0\" min.\n\tNOTE: If the core body temperature of the mouse is below 35 °C, wait for additional time for the animal to recover from anesthesia-induced hypothermia.\nQuickly, transfer the individual mouse into the preheated mouse chamber. This marks the START of the experiment trial. Only one mouse is screened at a given time.\n3. Heat-induced seizure assay\nAfter gently placing the mouse on the floor of the pre-heated mouse heat chamber, close the plexiglass door and start the camera for video recording the experiment.",
    "Start the stopwatch. Record the body temperature of the mouse from the rectal thermometer at 1 min intervals for the duration of the experiment.\nAt regular intervals, increase the temperature of the mouse heat chamber such that the body temperature of the mouse increases at a rate of 0.25-0.5 °C /min.\n\tNOTE: Rapid increases in body temperature can lead to heat stroke or death and should be avoided.\nFollowing this protocol, increase the temperature of the mouse heat chamber by 5 °C every 10 min as shown in Figure 2A.\nAt 9.5 min, set the temperature of the heat chamber to 55 °C, to stabilize the temperature of the heat chamber to 55 °C by the 10th min as shown on the digital temperature display.\nSimilarly, increase the temperature to 60 °C at 19.5 min to stabilize the temperature of the heat chamber to 60 °C by the 20th min. Each seizure screening trial lasts for 30 min.\nIf the mouse has a seizure (vocalizes, shows head nodding, forelimb clonus, hindlimb extension, falls on its side, or experiences generalized tonic/clonic convulsions), record the following information.\n\t\nRecord the body temperature of the mouse during the seizure (seizure threshold temperature) from the rectal temperature thermometer.\nRecord the seizure behavior characteristics such as head nodding, forelimb clonus, hind limb extension, falling on the side, and/or generalized tonic/clonic seizures (GTCS) displayed by the mouse.\nQuickly but gently pick up the mouse from the chamber and place it on the cooling pad prepared in step 1.6.",
    "NOTE: If a mouse is experiencing Racine scale 5 seizures and exhibiting uncontrolled jumping, it can be difficult to pick up the animal from the heat chamber and transferred to the cooling pad outside. However, a typical heat-induced seizure lasts between 30 s to 60 s.Thus, the mouse should be taken out of the heat-chamber and put on the cooling pad within 60 s of start of heat-induced seizure episode.\nWait for the mouse body temperature to come down to 36-37 °C, before transferring it to a recovery cage. Only one mouse is placed in a recovery cage at a time.\n\tNOTE: Do not mix mice that are yet to be used for heat-induced screening with the mouse that has already experienced the heat-induced seizure experiment trial.\nGently and carefully, cut the tape between the mouse tail and rectal probe wire with a pair of scissors to remove the rectal probe from the mouse.\nWipe clean the metal tip of the rectal probe with 70% alcohol and soft tissue wipes to keep it ready for the next trial.\nContinue to observe the mouse in the recovery cage until it resumes normal activity (walking, grooming, etc.), before returning the mouse to its home cage. This marks the END of the experiment trial for this mouse.\nRecord the animal status after the assay-alive and recovered from the test session or dead. High intensity seizures involving uncontrolled jumping and generalized tonic/clonic seizures can sometimes result in the death of the mouse.\nIf a mouse does not experience heat-induced seizures within the 30 min observation period or the body temperature of the mouse reaches 44 °C, remove the mouse from the heat chamber and place on the cooling pad till the body temperature of the mouse returns to 36-37 °C.",
    "Reset the temperature of the mouse heat chamber to 50 °C and allow it to equilibrate till the display temperature on the digital temperature controller shows 50 °C.\nChange cob bedding between individual mouse trials.\nPrepare the next mouse for screening trial as described in section 2 and repeat the steps from section 3.\n4. Euthanizing the animals\nAlthough most animals recover post heat-induced seizures, in our experience, a few of the mice undergo SUDEP (Sudden Unexplained Death in EPilepsy) in their home cage within 24-48 hrs of heat-induced seizures. After concluding the screening on all the mice individually for heat-induced seizures following the 30 min trial, euthanize all the mice as per the institution's IACUC guidelines.\n5. Analyzing the heat-induced seizure data\nAfter completing the screening of a cohort of animals, calculate the percentage of mice in a given genotype showing seizures using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62846/62846eq01.jpg\nEstimate the mean seizure threshold temperature of mice within a given genotype by averaging the seizure threshold temperature of all mice (noted in step 3.7) in that genotype that exhibit heat-induced seizures.\nWhile still being blind to the identity and genotype, replay the video recordings of each of the mouse during the heat-induced seizure assay screening on a computer screen to score severity of seizure bouts.\nGive scores to individual mouse exhibiting heat-induced seizure behavior by using the modified Racine scale13 as described by previous studies13,14. See Table 1 for details.\nIf a mouse, while experiencing heat-induced seizures, only shows head nodding, give it a score of 2. If a mouse starts a seizure episode with head nodding but also exhibits forelimb clonus, falling over, and/or jumping give it a score of 5.\nRecord the maximum score for each mouse using the modified Racine scale13 as described above.",
    "Plot a scatter graph of maximum Racine scores exhibited by all mice in a given genotype.\nStatistically compare maximum Racine scores among different mouse groups as a method to determine the severity of behavioral seizures such as heat-induced seizures.\n\tNOTE: Racine scores are helpful to compare seizure characteristics between different mutant mice groups or genotypes. It is expected that the wild-type mice would not undergo heat-induced seizures and would not have to be considered for Racine score comparisons.\nBased on experimental design, perform appropriate statistical analysis to determine if the percentage of mice exhibiting seizures between wild-type and mutant mice, and their mean seizure threshold temperature values are significantly different from each other.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nRacine Score,Seizure characteristics,Seizure characteristics,Seizure characteristics\n0,No seizures,No seizures,No seizures\n1,Mouth and facial movements,Mouth and facial movements,Mouth and facial movements\n2,Head nodding,Head nodding,Head nodding\n3,\"Forelimb clonus, usually one limb\",\"Forelimb clonus, usually one limb\",\"Forelimb clonus, usually one limb\"\n4,Forelimb clonus with rearing,Forelimb clonus with rearing,Forelimb clonus with rearing\n5,\"Generalized tonic-clonic seizure, rearing, jumping, falling over\",\"Generalized tonic-clonic seizure, rearing, jumping, falling over\",\"Generalized tonic-clonic seizure, rearing, jumping, falling over\"\nTable 1: Racine scores."
