    "1. Encapsulation of Hydrophobic Compounds in Polymeric NPs Using a CIJ Mixer\nPrepare and clean equipment.\n\t\nProcure and validate a CIJ mixer.\n\t\tNote: See Supplemental Information section 1 for construction guidance. CAD files are available as Supplemental Information as well.\nBefore each use, ensure that all fittings on the CIJ mixer are snug and the outlet tubing is not bent or pinched.\nIn a fume hood, attach a 5 mL luer lock syringe containing 2-3 mL of solvent to each inlet adapter. Select a solvent (e.g., acetone) that will clean any compounds recently used in the mixer.\n\t\tNote: Typical selections are acetone or tetrahydrofuran (THF). Only use polypropylene syringes to avoid solvent compatibility problems such as leaching. Do not use syringes with rubber O-ring seal plungers.\nSet the CIJ assembly over a waste container.\n\t\tNote: A flask with an opening smaller than the CIJ body works well as this supports the mixer and allows easy operation of the syringes.\nSteadily depress the syringe plungers to empty the contents through the mixing chamber over a few seconds. Remove the syringes.\n\t\tNote: Syringes can be retained and reused for multiple rounds of cleaning between FNP runs.\nDry the CIJ mixer internals using a N2 stream. A male luer adapter on the end of a N2 line is effective.\n\t\tNote: If the cleaning solvent is not volatile (e.g., DMSO), repeat steps 1.1.3-1.1.5 with acetone or THF before proceeding to step 1.1.6. It is crucial to remove residual solvent for run-to-run consistency.\nPrepare solvent and antisolvent streams at target compositions.\n\t\nDissolve the hydrophobic compound (i.e., vitamin E) in unstabilized THF at 10 mg/mL in sufficient amount to complete the desired number of FNP runs. Prepare slightly more than needed per run.",
    "Note: Other solvents can be used in these steps, subject to the constraints in the Discussion section. If employing THF, stabilizer-free solvent is recommended because butylated hydroxytoluene has low aqueous solubility. Use caution to avoid peroxide buildup (including peroxide testing) and be aware that low levels of peroxides may interfere with certain NP applications (e.g., bleaching of dyes).\nMix the vitamin E solution on a vortex mixer until dissolved.\n\t\tNote: For some compounds, bath sonication for 1-2 min may assist in generating a dissolved solution. It is important that all NP components are molecularly dissolved.\nDissolve the block copolymer stabilizer (i.e., poly(styrene)-b-poly(ethylene glycol), PS1.6k-b-PEG5k) in THF at 10 mg/mL at approximately the same volume as in step 1.2.1 to form the polymer solution.\n\t\tNote: Other solvents can be used, subject to the constraints detailed in the Discussion section.\nMix the polymer solution with a vortex mixer until dissolved. If necessary, place the solution in a sonication bath for 1-2 min to aid in solids dissolution.\n\t\tNote: The polymer cannot be in a micellar form. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) can be a useful tool to determine whether a new stream composition meets this criterion.\nCreate the solvent input stream containing 5 mg/mL of both vitamin E and the stabilizer (50% vitamin E loading) by first pipetting 0.25 mL of the vitamin E solution into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Then pipette 0.25 mL of the polymer solution into the same tube.\n\t\tNote: Volumes larger than 0.5 mL per run are feasible with different syringe sizes. Above 10 mL input volume, it is practical to use a syringe pump.",
    "Mix well on a vortex mixer for 5-10 s. Optionally, centrifuge the tube at 1000 x g for 5-10 s to recover any liquid stuck to the cap, which improves reproducibility between CIJ runs.\nPipette 0.525 mL of deionized water into a second 1.5 mL centrifuge tube as the antisolvent stream.\n\t\tNote: It is better to have excess antisolvent, which ensures that the solvent stream never enters the mixing chamber without antisolvent present. In some cases where salt solubility in the solvent/antisolvent mixture is not limiting, buffered aqueous systems can be used.\nPipette 4 mL of deionized water into a 20 mL scintillation vial or other suitable container as a quench bath. Place a small magnetic stir bar in the vial.\n\t\tNote: The quench bath reduces the Ostwald ripening by lowering the final solvent content to 10% by volume15,17. This volume may be adjusted to address process constraints and can be directly scaled with input stream volume.\nProduce NPs by FNP using the CIJ mixer.\n\t\nPosition the open quench bath vial below the cleaned CIJ mixer on a stir plate in a fume hood. A practical configuration uses a 50 mL test tube rack block to support the CIJ mixer with the vial below and the outlet tubing directed into the vial. See Figure 1A for orientation.\nBegin stirring the quench bath via the magnetic stir bar at around 75% max speed.\nUsing a 1 mL polypropylene syringe fitted with a blunt-tip needle, draw the full volume from the antisolvent tube.\n\t\tNote: Do not use syringes that contain a rubber O-ring seal to avoid compatibility concerns. For larger inlet volumes, use an appropriately sized luer lock syringe. The syringe outlet must be centered on the syringe axis or it will be unstable during depression.",
    "Carefully remove all air bubbles from the syringe and remove the blunt tip needle, disposing in a sharps container.\nPrime the plunger so that the stream comes just to the syringe opening. Attach the syringe to one of the CIJ inlet fittings.\nRepeat steps 1.3.3-1.3.5 for the solvent solution.\nRapidly, smoothly, and uniformly depress the syringes at the same time by placing the ball of the hand, the palm of the hand, or one thumb each on the tops of the plungers depending on personal preference. Collect the effluent in the quench bath vial.\n\t\tNote: A 0.5 mL input should be depressed in less than 0.5 s.\nSet aside the CIJ mixer with the syringes still attached. Remove the stir bar and cap the vial, which now contains the NP dispersion with a core-shell particle structure (Figure 1C).\nHold the mixer over a waste solution container and remove the syringes. The hold-up volume (about 0.25 mL) will then drain out. Dispose of the used syringes and repeat the cleaning step 1.1 before the next FNP trial.\n\t\tNote: Do not allow the hold-up volume to empty into the vial containing the NPs as this will negatively impact sample uniformity.\nPerform analysis and post-processing of NP dispersion.\n\t\nTo characterize the NP size using DLS, pipette 100 μL of the NP dispersion into a plastic cuvette and add 900 μL of the quench bath solvent (e.g., water).\n\t\tNote: Smaller volumes may be used for low-volume cuvettes. A 10-fold dilution is generally sufficient.\nMix well by pipetting up and down or by mild shaking. Follow the instrument-specific instructions to analyze the sample.",
    "Note: Alternative characterization techniques such as zeta potential analysis or electron microscopy may be carried out as required. The NP dispersion can be processed further as dictated by the application and reviewed in the Discussion section.\n2. Encapsulation of Hydrophilic Compounds in Inverted NPs Using a CIJ Mixer\nPrepare solvent, antisolvent, and quench solutions in fume hood.\n\t\nComplete the cleaning and preparation procedures described in step 1.1, using DMSO as a cleaning solvent and adhering to the note in step 1.1.6 to complete a second rinse with THF.\nDissolve the hydrophilic compound (i.e., maltodextrin (MD) with dextrose equivalent (DE) of 4-7, average molecular weight = 3,275 g/mol, “3k MD”) in DMSO at 10 mg/mL in sufficient volume to complete the desired number of FNP runs.\n\t\tNote: Other solvents can be used, subject to the constraints outlined in the Discussion section.\nMix the maltodextrin solution with a vortex mixer until dissolved. If necessary, place the solution in a sonication bath for 1-2 min to aid in solids dissolution.\nCreate a block copolymer stabilizer (i.e., poly(styrene)-b-poly(acrylic acid), PS5k-b-PAA4.8k) stock solution in THF at 11.1 mg/mL at approximately the same volume as in step 2.1.2 to form the polymer solution.\n\t\tNote: Other solvents and stabilizer concentrations can be used. DMSO can readily be used as a solvent in place of THF.\nMix the polymer solution with a vortex mixer until dissolved. If necessary, place the solution in a sonication bath for 1-2 min to aid in solids dissolution.\n\t\tNote: The polymer input cannot be in a micellar form. DLS can be used to determine whether a new stream composition meets this criterion.",
    "Prepare the solvent stream input (0.5 mL) by combining the following, in order, in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube: 0.250 mL of the 3k MD solution, 0.225 mL of polymer solution, and 0.025 mL deionized water.\n\t\tNote: The water content of this stream has a strong impact on NP size and polydispersity. Generally it is best to operate in the 2.5-10 vol% range20. Values on the high end of the range may help encapsulation of larger molecular weight compounds.\nMix well on a vortex mixer for 5-10 s.\nOptionally, centrifuge the tube at 1000 x g for 5-10 s to recover any liquid stuck to the cap, which improves reproducibility between CIJ runs.\nPrepare a crosslinker solution of calcium chloride (CaCl2) dihydrate in methanol at 25.0 mg/mL.\n\t\tNote: The crosslinker will be added at a 1:1 charge ratio to the acid groups in the PAA block. Adjust the concentration accordingly if a different crosslinker is used or if a different PAA block size or polymer concentration is used20,21.\nPrepare the antisolvent stream by pipetting 0.5 mL of chloroform and 0.05 mL of the crosslinker solution (0.55 mL total) into a microcentrifuge tube.\n\t\tNote: Other acceptable antisolvents are dictated by the block copolymer choice and typically include dichloromethane or acetone. The crosslinker may instead be added to the quench bath, with additional aging of the NP dispersion to allow for crosslink formation20.\nMix well on a vortex mixer for 5-10 s.\nOptionally, centrifuge the tube at 1000 x g for 5-10 s to recover any liquid stuck to the cap, which improves reproducibility between CIJ runs.\nAdd 4 mL of the antisolvent (i.e., chloroform) to a 20 mL scintillation vial to form the quench bath. Place a small magnetic stir bar in the vial.",
    "Note: This volume may be adjusted to address process constraints.\nComplete the protocol for NP formation as described in step 1.3.\nPerform analysis and post-processing of NP dispersion.\n\t\nTo characterize the NP size using DLS, pipette 100 μL of the NP dispersion into a glass cuvette and add 900 μL of the solvent used for the quench bath.\nMix well by pipetting up and down or by light agitation of the cuvette. Follow the software instructions to analyze the sample.\n\t\tNote: Crosslinking of the NPs can be qualitatively assessed by DLS using a good solvent like DMSO or dimethylformamide (DMF) as DLS diluent20. Particles which are stably crosslinked will exhibit an autocorrelation function in the solvent with minimal change in particle size. Poorly crosslinked particles swell and exhibit a weak autocorrelation function and scattering strength21.\nOptionally, add a base, such as ammonia, to drive ionic complexation and strengthen crosslinking in the particle core.\n\t\t\nOptionally, prepare a 3.48 mg/mL solution of ammonia in methanol gravimetrically using ammonium hydroxide solution (typically, 30 wt% ammonia). Add 50 μL (i.e., 0.6 equivalents with respect to the acid groups on the polymer) dropwise with stirring.\n\t\t\tNote: The equivalents can be adjusted if desired by varying either the concentration or the volume added25.\nOptionally, age no less than 30 min with mild stirring for crosslinking to occur.\nProcess the NP dispersion to produce either microparticles or coated NPs as described in the literature19,20,21.\n3. Encapsulation of Ovalbumin in Inverted NPs Using a μMIVM\nPrepare solvent and antisolvent solutions.\n\t\nPrepare a 50 mg/mL solution of ovalbumin in deionized water (“OVA”).",
    "Prepare 0.75 mL of Solution A in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube by diluting 75 μL of the OVA solution with 0.675 mL of DMSO to generate a 5 mg/mL solution of OVA in DMSO containing 10% water by volume. Mix well and centrifuge briefly as described previously.\n\t\tNote: See step 2.1.6 regarding water effects. As in previous sections, the solution volumes can be scaled up or down to fit material needs.\nPrepare solution B by dissolving the block copolymer stabilizer (i.e., poly(styrene)-b-poly(acrylic acid), PS5k-b-PAA4.8k) in DMSO at 6 mg/mL. Mix well and sonicate to dissolve if needed. Pipette 0.75 mL into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nPipette 0.75 mL of THF (Solution C) into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nPipette 1.85 mL of chloroform (Solution D) into a glass scintillation vial.\nPrepare a 60.0 mg/mL calcium chloride dihydrate crosslinker solution in methanol. Mix using a vortex mixer.\nPrepare a 4.17 mg/mL ammonia solution in methanol as described in step 2.3.4.\nAdd 5.25 mL of chloroform to a 15 mL centrifuge tube as the quench bath.\nPrepare mixer assembly and stand.\n\t\nGather the bottom receiver, mixing geometry disk, the top disk, the spanner wrench, and an O-ring. See Figure 2 for schematic of components and mixer stand terminology.\n\t\tNote: Details on MIVM construction may be found in Supplemental Information (Section 1) and in the literature22. CAD files are available as Supplemental Information as well.\nPlace the O-ring into the groove, ensuring that it fits well and that there are no signs of wear or damage.",
    "Note: Normal operation will lead to worn or solvent-swollen O-rings. If the O-ring appears stretched or deformed, allow it to air dry overnight before use. If the shape does not recover overnight, dispose of the O-ring. Keep a large stock, as this is a consumable part.\nCarefully align the mixing disk holes with the pegs on the top disk and push together. Ensure that the O-ring does not become displaced by checking the two pieces sit flush.\nInvert the two pieces and manually assemble them with the bottom receiver. Ensure that the outlet tubing fitting has been loosened so that it does not interfere with complete tightening of the disk.\n\t\tNote: If the threading catches during assembly, carefully disassemble and apply a food- or pharmaceutical-grade anti-seize to the threading to prevent galling.\nAfter manual tightening, fit the spanner wrench to the top disk pegs and snugly tighten the assembly. Then tighten the outlet tubing fitting so that it sits firmly against the bottom face of the mixing geometry. Ensure that the syringe fittings on the top disk are snug.\nPlace the assembled mixer onto the mixer stand so that the outlet tubing extends below the support plate. Support the mobile plate so that it is suspended out of the way of the work space.\nOptionally, to check mechanical stop alignment, first attach the empty glass syringes to the mixer inlets.\n\t\tNote: Volumetric flowrates are varied using syringes of different barrel diameters, since the syringes are depressed simultaneously at the same linear velocity. The initial and final vertical heights must be the same for all syringes and can be adjusted using set screws tapped into the plunger shaft22. The mechanical stops ensure that excessive damage to the glass syringes does not occur.",
    "Optionally, lower the mobile plate so that is comes to rest on the mechanical stops. Ensure that these are aligned so that the plate also comes to rest immediately before contacting the empty syringes (as seen in Figure 2).\nOptionally, loosen the mechanical stops and reposition, if needed. Remove the glass syringes and reset the mobile plate out of the way.\n\t\t\tNote: For operation with plastic syringes, the mechanical stops are not required.\nPlace the open quench bath below the outlet tubing to collect the effluent.\nDraw Solution A into a 1 mL gas-tight syringe using a blunt tip needle. Remove all air bubbles and dispose of the needle. Prime the solution to the end of the syringe luer fitting. Repeat this process for Solutions B and C.\nDraw Solution D into a 2.5 mL gas-tight syringe using a blunt tip needle. Remove all air bubbles and dispose of the needle. Prime the solution to the end of the syringe luer fitting.\n\t\tNote: These volumes have been selected so that the initial syringe plunger heights are the same. If volumes are changed, they still must meet this height requirement.\nAssemble the four syringes onto the mixer in a clockwise fashion in alphabetical order. See Figure 1B for final appearance and syringe orientation schematic.\n\t\tNote: Check that no syringe height is significantly different from the others and troubleshoot as needed.\nPerform mixer operation and cleaning.\n\t\nGrip the bearing housing on both sides of the mobile plate. Do not place fingers on the bottom face of the housing because this is a pinch hazard against the mechanical stops. Slowly lower the mobile plate so that it is resting evenly but barely touching the syringes.",
    "Steadily and smoothly depress the plate, aiming to complete the operation in about 0.5-1 s for these stream volumes22.\n\t\t\nRemove and cap the quench bath tube which now contains the NP dispersion.\nTake the mixer with the syringes still attached and hold over a waste container. Remove the syringes, allowing the hold-up volume to drain into the container. Hold the mixer assembly upside and disassemble the mixer using the spanner wrench.\nUsing a spray bottle, rinse the outlet tubing with several milliliters of solvent (e.g., acetone) and dry with air or nitrogen.\nRinse the mixing geometry with a good solvent (e.g., deionized water or DMSO) and then rinse with acetone using several milliliters from a spray bottle. Dry with an air or nitrogen stream.\nRinse the O-ring in a stream of deionized water and blot dry.\nRinse the top disk thoroughly with several milliliters of acetone using a solvent bottle until visually clean. Dry with an air or nitrogen stream both the surface and the syringe fittings.\nRinse each syringe with several milliliters of a good solvent (e.g., deionized water or acetone) from a solvent bottle. Apply a final rinse of several milliliters of acetone and air dry before next use.\nPerform post-processing and analysis.\n\t\nAdd 50 μL of the calcium chloride dihydrate crosslinker solution dropwise while stirring at about 75% maximum speed.\nAdd 50 μL of the ammonia solution dropwise while stirring at 75% maximum speed. Age for at least 30 min.\nCharacterize the NP size as described in steps 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.\nProcess the NP dispersion to produce either microparticles or coated NPs as described in the literature19,20,21.\n4. Modifications for Formulation Scale-up",
    "Prepare the solvent and antisolvent solutions as described in steps 1, 2, or 3 at the desired composition and at sufficient volume for the required formulation size.\nOptionally, if needed, clean and sterilize the mixer in place using a suitable protocol prior to NP formation.\n\tNote: Sequential rinses of CIP 100, water (to neutral pH), CIP 200, water (to neutral pH), and a suitable solvent have been employed in the past. Additionally, sterile filters can be attached to the inlets of the mixer in instances where final particle size precludes sterilization by filtration.\nLoad the solutions into gas-tight syringes of suitable volume and attach polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing with a luer adapter fitted on the end. Manually prime the solutions to the end of the tubing.\n\t\nLoad the syringes into a syringe pump and attach the syringes to the mixer inlets on either the CIJ or the MIVM, as required.\n\t\tNote: Alternatively, flow controllers can be used at lab or pilot scale to provide larger volume capabilities than a syringe pump. Successful operation requires steady flow and sufficient pressure drop, which means that pressurized vessels with flow metering on the outlet are the most appropriate selection for large scale production.\nPlace a collection vessel containing a quench bath of sufficient volume, if required, beneath the outlet tubing.\nSet the volumetric flow rates to match those achieved manually (e.g., about 30-60 mL/min per stream).\n\tNote: If using the CIJ, the pump flow rates must be identical. If using the MIVM, different inlets can have different flow rates.\nSimultaneously begin the pumps. Collect about 5-10 mL of effluent as waste in a small vial (this is a “start-up volume”) and then begin collecting in the quench bath.\nCharacterize and process as described in the corresponding formulation section above."
