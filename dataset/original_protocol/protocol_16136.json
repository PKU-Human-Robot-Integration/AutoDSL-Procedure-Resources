    "The sample preparation follows a standard IF staining protocol. This protocol provides a guide for preserving subcellular structures (microtubules and mitochondria) in U2OS cells and describes sample preparation for two distinct single-antibody labeling approaches: 1) single-antibody labeling using dye-conjugated primary antibodies and 2) single-antibody labeling using dye-conjugated secondary antibodies on samples stained with unconjugated primary antibodies.\nMaterials\nU2OS cell line (ATCC, HTB-96)\nComplete DMEM (see recipe)\n0.25% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA (Fisher Scientific, 25200-056)\nDPBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14190-144, 500 ml)\nFixation buffer (see recipe; make fresh)\nBlocking buffer (containing permeabilization reagent; see recipe; make fresh)\nPost-fixation buffer (see recipe; make fresh; optional)\nUnconjugated primary antibodies (see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-tbl-0001])\nTable 1.\n                Unconjugated Antibodies Used for Immunofluorescence Staining\ntable:\n﻿Antibody,Target,Antibody concentration (nM)\n\"ReadyTag anti-HA (12CA5) (Bio X Cell, RT0268, 25 mg)\",3×HA tag on α-tubulin (microtubule),67\n\"Rabbit polyclonal anti-Tom20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA5-32148)\",Tom20 (mitochondria),27\n100 × 20–mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon, 353003)\nTube of choice\nStandard tabletop centrifuge\n8-well chambered cover glasses (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 55411, or Cellvis, C8-1-N)\nParafilm (Amcor, PM996)\nAdditional reagents and equipment for counting cells (see Current Protocols article: Phelan & May, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-bib-0011])\nCAUTION: Paraformaldehyde is a carcinogenic, toxic chemical.

    "NOTE: All solutions and equipment coming into contact with cells must be sterile, and proper sterile technique should be used accordingly, including use of a biological safety cabinet (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1300 Series A2).\nNOTE: All culture incubations are performed in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Series 8000 WJ) unless otherwise specified.\nCell seeding and fixation\n1. Maintain the U2OS cell line in 10 ml complete DMEM (initial cell density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2) in 100 × 20–mm tissue culture dishes in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Subculture when the cells reach ∼70% confluency.\n2. Trypsinize cells with 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, incubate for 3 min, neutralize with 9 ml complete DMEM, place in tube of choice, and centrifuge 3 min at 250 × g. Then, seed ∼5000 cells in 400 µl complete DMEM per well in an 8-well chambered cover glass. Let the cells grow at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 36 hr before fixing.\nAfter 36 hr, the cells achieve a confluency of ∼40%.\n3. Wash cells with 400 µl DPBS once.\n4. Add 200 µl fixation buffer and incubate the sample for 15 to 20 min at room temperature.\n5. Remove the fixation buffer and wash the sample two times with DPBS.\n6. Add 400 µl fresh DPBS, cover sample chambers with parafilm to prevent the cells from drying out during storage, and store fixed samples for ≤1 month at 4°C.\nOptional: Add sodium azide solution (5 mM in DPBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 19038-1000, MW 65.01) to inhibit bacterial growth.\nSample preparation for single-antibody labeling using dye-conjugated primary antibodies\n7a.

    "The blocking buffer contains either 5% (w/v) BSA or 10% (v/v) goat serum if a goat-host secondary antibody is used. Permeabilization is done by adding 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 to the blocking buffer. The permeabilization step should be skipped if labeling plasma membrane proteins. The permeabilization step should also be skipped if cell extraction was performed during fixation, i.e., with use of cytoskeleton buffer (see recipe for fixation buffer).\n8a. Optional: Add 200 µl post-fixation buffer. Incubate the sample for 10 min at room temperature.\nThis step preserves the sample blocking for single-antibody labeling.\nThis step may be omitted if the antibody no longer effectively stains the sample or results in poor staining after post-fixation. During the initial stages of our protocol development, we observed that omitting this step resulted in a noticeable increase in nonspecific binding events.\n9a. Optional: Wash the sample two times with DPBS.\n10a. Add 200 µl fresh DPBS. Proceed for Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-prot-0002] for time-lapse imaging with single-antibody labeling using dye-conjugated primary antibodies.\nOptional: Add sodium azide (5 mM in DPBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 19038-1000, MW 65.01) to inhibit bacterial growth.\nSamples can be stored ≤1 month at 4°C until imaging.

Add 200 µl blocking buffer (containing permeabilization reagent) to the sample. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\n8b. Dilute the unconjugated primary antibody in 200 µl blocking buffer to a final concentration within the manufacturer-recommended range.\nIn our study, we used a concentration of 4 µg/ml (27 nM) for full-length IgG (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-tbl-0001]).\n9b.

    "10b. Wash the sample three times with DPBS.\n11b. Add 200 µl post-fixation buffer. Incubate the sample for 10 min at room temperature.\nThis step preserves the primary antibody staining on the sample.\n12b. Wash the sample three times with DPBS. Add 200 µl fresh DPBS after washing. Proceed to time-lapse imaging with single-antibody labeling using dye-conjugated secondary antibodies, as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-prot-0002].\nOptional: Add sodium azide (5 mM in DPBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 19038-1000, MW 65.01) to inhibit bacterial growth during storage.\nSamples can be stored ≤1 month at 4°C. Cover sample chambers with parafilm during storage to prevent the cells from drying out.",
    "The following protocol provides the steps for three implementations of single-antibody labeling: 1) time-lapse imaging with single-antibody labeling, 2) multiplexed imaging with single-antibody labeling, and 3) dual-color single-target imaging with single-antibody labeling.\nThe first section of the protocol after data acquisition initiation outlines the steps for a basic single-antibody labeling experiment. This section includes the steps for initiating the imaging process, identifying the optimal antibody concentration, selecting the optimal NII, and setting up the imaging parameters for a subcellular target. Fiducial markers need to be added to the sample for drift correction. A short trial run must be performed to determine the optimal antibody concentration and NII before proceeding with extended acquisitions. This protocol is written for using an inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments, Eclipse Ti2E) with a 100×/1.49 oil objective and a Prime 95B sCMOS camera. The laser power densities indicated in the steps are measured after the objective. Imaging is performed using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy setup. Data acquisition is performed using ND acquisition in Nikon NIS-Elements software (version 5.21.03).\nThe second section of the protocol outlines the extended steps for multiplexed single-antibody labeling using different antibodies. The third section of the protocol focuses on dual-color single-antibody labeling of a single target. The rationale for developing this assay is that single-antibody labeling can yield lower sample labeling densities than other SMLM techniques. Dual-color single-antibody labeling increases the labeling density while minimizing the spatial overlap between molecules. This strategy uses a mixture of the same antibody conjugated with two different dyes. Additionally, the Alternate Protocol describes the use of OptoSplit II for dual-color imaging.\nMaterials\nChamber slide with target of interest prepared according to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-prot-0001]\nIndex-matching immersion oil (Cargille Laboratories, 16245; refractive index 1.5150)",

Turn on the inverted fluorescence microscope, Prime 95B sCMOS camera, acquisition computer with image acquisition software, and laser unit.\nIf the Prime 95B sCMOS camera is connected to the acquisition computer via Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe), be sure to turn on the camera before starting the computer.\n3. Select the objective (i.e., 100×/1.49 oil-immersion objective) and apply a layer of index-matching immersion oil.",
    "4. Position the sample on the microscope stage and raise the objective (e.g., 100×/1.49 oil objective) until the immersion oil makes contact with the sample.\nIf the objective carries an adjustable correction collar ring, adjust it to match the thickness of the cover glass. For instance, the thickness of cover glass #1 is 0.13 to 0.16 mm, so the correction ring would need to be set at the corresponding marking at 23°C (white-color marking) for image acquisition.\nIn the Nikon Eclipse Ti2E system, the perfect focus system (PFS) maintains the focus during imaging. Raise the objective using the focus knob until the PFS is engaged (PFS indicator “on”) and mount the sample.\n5. Open the image acquisition software that controls the data acquisition.\n6. Choose the optical configuration (excitation laser, quad-band set, and emission filter) for the fluorophore selected for single-antibody labeling.\nFor instance, if an antibody is conjugated to Alexa Fluor (AF) 647, select the 640-nm excitation laser, the quad-band set TRF89901-ET, and the emission filter ET700/75m. Save the settings to the optical configuration.\n7. Select the laser power intensity level and set the camera parameters.\nA laser power density between 20 and 30 W/cm2 and a camera exposure of 50 ms can be used initially. These parameters can be adjusted to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\n8. Prepare fiducial markers by vortexing TetraSpeck microspheres for 30 s or sonicating gold colloids for 3 min before use. Dilute TetraSpeck microspheres (size: 200 nm) 1:1000 in DPBS. Dilute gold colloids (size: 100 nm) 1:5 in Milli-Q water.\n9. Add fiducial markers (i.e., TetraSpeck microspheres or gold colloids) to the sample. Incubate sample with TetraSpeck microspheres for 5 min and gold colloids for 10 to 20 min.",
    "Fiducials can also be added to the sample after the sample preparation before placing it on the microscope stage.\n10. Using brightfield illumination, locate a cell and focus on it.\n11. Identify fiducial markers near the cell that can be used for drift correction (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ee1b7990-21e2-4231-bba9-6bafe89bd1cf/cpz1908-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nFiducial markers for drift correction in imaging.

Replace the fiducial marker solution with 200 µl DPBS.\nThe sample is ready for image acquisition.\nTime-lapse imaging with single-antibody labeling\n13a. Starting with an antibody concentration of 0.003 to 0.5 nM, prepare the imaging buffer by diluting the dye-conjugated antibody in DPBS.\nThe optimal antibody concentration (in the imaging buffer) and NII (see step 18a) need to be adjusted to capture sufficient single-molecule events without significant spatial overlap (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-fig-0003] vs. 3B). Refer to Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-tbl-0002] for dye-conjugated antibody concentrations. The optimal concentration and NII differ significantly for different antibodies and targets. In our study (Gunasekara et al., 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-bib-0004]), we conducted an NII scan, exploring NIIs of 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 s for different antibody systems. Through DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) characterization, we observed that increasing the NII led to increased capture of high-density events, likely associated with specific antibody-binding events.\nWhen the concentration of dye-conjugated primary or secondary antibodies is provided in mg/ml, use the appropriate molecular weights of the antibodies (full-length IgG = 150 kDa, F(ab’)2 = 110 kDa) to convert the concentration to nM.\nIf the stock solution is highly concentrated (100× or more), perform a serial dilution to minimize pipetting errors.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/70127677-3e9d-4446-9cb1-5e859320b296/cpz1908-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

The higher number of overlapping events in (A) renders single-molecule localization difficult. The antibody concentrations used are as follows: [12CA5-AF 647] =1 nM (A) and 0.5 nM (B); [DMIA-AF 488] = 1 nM (A) and 0.003 nM (B); [F(ab′)2-AF 647] = 0.5 nM (A) and 0.063 nM (B). NII= 20 s.

Increase the laser power density (100 to 400 W/cm2) and set the exposure time (50 ms).\nThe provided laser power and exposure time serve as a starting point. Adjust the parameters to capture more photons per frame while maintaining a low background signal.\n16a. Adjust the TIRF angle to achieve the maximum SNR.\nAn optimal TIRF angle restricts out-of-focus excitation and maximizes the SNR. In our study, we used a laser power density ranging between 100 and 400 W/cm2 and an exposure time of 50 ms, resulting in an SNR of 3 to 5. The antibody concentration was maintained within the range of 0.003 to 0.5 nM, depending on the antibody (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-fig-0004] and Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-tbl-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8e3fb077-128f-438e-8072-bb12a4f20fa4/cpz1908-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nCross-sectional intensity profiles across the indicated yellow lines showing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for three antibody-target systems from Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-tbl-0002].

    "In our study, we used ND Acquisition to set the NII and the frames. A similar acquisition control tab can be used for a different microscopy system to set up the imaging parameters and NII.\n18a. In the “Time” tab, input the NII in the “interval” column. Input the frames in the “loops” column.\n19a. Select “Time” tab and click “Run now” to record a movie consisting of at least 50 frames.\n20a. Replay the recorded movie and evaluate the sparsity of the binding events.\nA single-molecule event density of 0.09 to 0.3 events/μm² serves as a starting point for new antibody-target systems (Gunasekara et al., 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-bib-0004]).\n21a. To determine the average number of single-molecule events/μm², select three representative regions (e.g., 15 × 15 μm) of the movie captured in step 20a.\n22a. Count the number of single-molecule events in each frame and calculate the average number of events/μm².\nThe ThunderSTORM plug-in in ImageJ can be used for this purpose (refer to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.908#cpz1908-prot-0004] for using the ThunderSTORM plug-in).\nIn our study, the counts of single-molecule events in a chosen area (e.g., 225 μm²), with a range of events (e.g., 20 to 70), is calculated to be between 0.09 and 0.3 events/μm².\n23a. Adjust the antibody concentration of the imaging buffer to generate the optimal single-molecule event density for single-molecule localization microscopy (see step 13a).\nIf overlapping single-molecule events are observed right after the addition of the imaging buffer or if an accumulation of events is noted as the acquisition progresses, terminate the acquisition, decrease the concentration of the antibody solution by 10-fold, and reevaluate. If the concentration is still too high, decrease another 10-fold. If the concentration is too low, increase by 10-fold, reevaluate, and so on. Use a new sample well and repeat steps 19a to 22a.",

Select “Run analysis” in ThunderSTORM and click “Ok”.\nOnce the analysis is complete, a “results” table and the corresponding reconstructed image will appear. The selected single molecule localizations on the raw data will appear as red crosses on the movie file.\n12. Apply the drift correction by clicking the “Drift correction” tab in the results table. Check “Load from file”.\nBy default, the information of the last saved drift correction file is kept. In this case, click “Apply”. The x-y drift profile appears. The drift-corrected result file and the reconstructed image appear.\n13. In the “Visualization” tab, set the visualization method and magnification to render the final superresolution image.\nFor visualization of the results, we used “Averaged shifted histograms” or “Normalized Gaussian” at a forced lateral uncertainty of 20 nm. The magnification was set to 7.3 to have a pixel size of 20 nm in the reconstructed image.\nAdditional post-processing steps can be used to optimize the image reconstruction. Refer to the ThunderSTORM user's guide, version 1.3, post-processing modules.\nOptional: Change the “LUT” using “Lookup Tables” in ImageJ as intended.
