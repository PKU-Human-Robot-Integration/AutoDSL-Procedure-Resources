    "1. Yeast strain construction\nObtain marker plasmids and a suitable yeast strain.\n\tNOTE: The plasmids are available from Addgene. This protocol utilizes TN124 (MATa ura3 trp1 pho8Δ60 pho13Δ::LEU2), BY4741(MATa leu2Δ0 ura3Δ his3Δ1 met15Δ0), and DJ03 (BY4741 trp1Δ::MET15) as examples. One important consideration for strain choice, other than the nature of the scientific question, is the compatibility of selection markers. The organelle marker plasmids described here use URA3 and TRP1 as the selection markers. Therefore, the genotype of the recipient strain needs to be ura3 and trp1. Otherwise, one needs to modify the strain or the plasmids.\nPrepare yeast media according to the following recipes.\n\tNOTE: SMD (synthetic minimal dextrose; 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (YNB) without amino acids, 30 mg/L adenine, 30 mg/L lysine, 30 mg/L methionine, 20 mg/L histidine, 20 mg/L uracil, 50 mg/L tryptophan, 50 mg/L leucine). SMD+CA (SMD with the addition of 0.5% casamino acids). YPD (Yeast extract peptone dextrose; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). SD-N (synthetic dextrose without nitrogen; 0.17% YNB without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose). Please refer to the Discussion section for considerations on the choice of the medium.\nPrior to the transformation step, generate linearized DNA fragments by enzymatic digestion or PCR amplification of an organelle marker plasmid.\n\tNOTE: Table 1 lists the restriction enzyme sites and PCR primers to generate linear fragments from the organelle marker plasmids.\nCulture yeast cells in liquid YPD medium and transform yeast with linear DNA fragment.\n\tNOTE: Yeast transformation can be performed using the conventional LiAc-based method9 or other methods of choice. It is advisable to include appropriate controls for transformation, in particular, a negative control with no plasmid or plasmid-derived DNA.\nIncubate on an appropriate selection plate (e.g., for URA3 selection, use SMD-Ura medium) at 30 °C for 2-3 days.",
    "NOTE: It takes about 2 days for single colonies to show up.\nTo verify fluorescent chimera expression and integration copy number, pick eight colonies from the selection plate, re-streak on fresh selection plates, and incubate at 30 °C.\n2. Fluorescence microscopy: general procedures and single time-point imaging\nCulture yeast cells overnight in SMD liquid medium at 30 °C with shaking.\nThe next morning, measure the optical density of yeast culture at 600 nm (hereafter referred to as OD600) in a spectrophotometer or plate reader.\n\tNOTE: With some practice on inoculating yeast, one can usually ensure that OD600 of all samples is lower than 2 at this stage. If it ends up higher, it is advisable to dilute more in the next step and allow more time for yeast cells to recover.\nDilute yeast culture to approximately 0.2 OD600 using a fresh medium.\nContinue culturing till OD600 reaches approximately 0.8-1.0.\n\tNOTE: The doubling time of yeast is about 1.5-2 h.\nPut a cover glass on top of tissue paper on a flat surface, spread 5 µL of 1 mg/mL concanavalin A on the top side of the cover glass, and wait for 5 min (Figure 1A)10.\n\tNOTE: This preparation step can be done ahead of time.\nTransfer 100 µL of yeast culture to the top side of the cover glass, and wait for 5 min.\nCombine cover glass with a supporting glass slide, with the yeast cells sandwiched in-between; press with appropriate force to secure the attachment.\n\tNOTE: It takes some practice to find the right pressure, so that yeast cells form an immobile single layer but are not crushed (Figure 1B). The liquid medium will be pushed out and absorbed by the underlying tissue paper during this step.",
    "Mount the sample slide on the microscope stage. Locate and focus on a patch of yeast cells using differential interference contrast (DIC) or phase contrast (PC) illumination.\n\tNOTE: Do not use fluorescence to locate cells; otherwise, the signal may get bleached prior to data collection.\nManually configure three sets of parameters to collect image z-stacks: z-sectioning, imaging channels, and exposure parameters.\n\tNOTE: See Supplementary Figure 1 for GUI examples of parameter settings in one commercial software. The exact look differs across software platforms, but the options are more or less the same.\n\t\nZ-sectioning: Collect slices at 0.5 µm stepping for 15 slices (covering 7 µm depth, generally sufficient for normal haploid yeast cells).\nImaging channels: Select DIC or PC for cell contours and appropriate fluorescence channels as needed.\nExcitation light intensity and exposure time: Set the excitation light intensity and exposure time as appropriate for the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: As a starting point, use 100% for excitation light intensity and 100 ms for exposure time; decrease light intensity if photobleaching becomes obvious with the progression of z-stack collection or if the signal exceeds camera recording capacity (i.e., signal saturation); increase the light intensity if the signal-to-noise ratio is low.\nWrite down the imaging settings and use the same settings for all samples to be compared.\n\tNOTE: Do not use the \"auto\" setting for data collection and image visualization. It is important to record the settings in a lab note so that the exact same parameters can be re-applied in future experimental repeats. Some microscope controlling software applications have the ability to save and re-apply settings; even so, it is advisable to have the settings recorded independently because software profiles may get deleted or modified unintentionally by co-workers.\nSave the data in 16-bit multichannel stack format.",
    "NOTE: Do not save as 8-bit RGB pictures (or 24 bit, if counting all three colors). See the image visualization section (Section 4) for limitations of the 8-bit format.\nMove to a completely different area for the next image stack collection.\n\t​NOTE: Adjacent areas may have experienced photobleaching and phototoxicity. As a result, the image stack collected from these areas may be misleading.\n3. Time-lapse imaging\nNOTE: The procedure of time-lapse imaging differs from the one for single time-point imaging in two areas: sample preparation and imaging parameters.\nSample preparation\n\t\nCoat a 35 mm glass-bottom dish with 1 mg/mL concanavalin A and wait 5 min or more.\nAdd 1.5 mL of yeast liquid culture to the dish, and wait for 5 min to allow the yeast cells to settle to the glass surface.\nUsing a pipet, aspirate the liquid medium from the edge of the dish, then gently rinse the patch of yeast sediment with about 1 mL of fresh medium to remove insecurely attached cells.\nRepeat the rinsing 2-3 times. Aspirate with a pipet, then gently add 2 mL of fresh culture medium.\nImaging parameters\n\t\nZ-sectioning: Collect slices at 0.5 µm stepping for 15 slices.\nImaging channels: Select as needed.\nExcitation light intensity and exposure time: Use the minimal necessary to discern the subcellular structure under investigation.\n\t\tNOTE: For time-lapse imaging, photobleaching and phototoxicity from repeated illumination limit the total number of time points that can be collected. Therefore, excitation intensity and exposure time are generally set to low values so that more time points can be imaged.\nImaging interval: Set the timing intervals appropriate for the biological process being investigated.",
    "NOTE: For example, the formation of an autophagosome under starvation conditions takes about 5-10 min; an interval of 1 min or less is preferred to track its dynamics. Under nutrient-rich conditions, the yeast cell cycle occurs on the hour scale; a longer interval, such as 10-20 min, can be utilized.\nIf proper hardware is available, maintain the dish temperature at 30 °C.\n\t​NOTE: Most biological processes in yeast cells can also be imaged at room temperature (RT), except at a slower pace in general.\n4. Visualization of image stacks and assessment of integration copy number\nInstall Fiji or ImageJ software for image visualization and analysis11,12.\n\tNOTE: Fiji is a tool collection based on ImageJ, suitable for general purpose biological image data visualization and processing. For image processing listed in this protocol, ImageJ without additional plugins is sufficient.\nPick appropriate parameters for image display and comparison.\n\t\nIn Fiji, open a couple of z-stack images.\nDrag the z-position in each stack to the mid-section (or other positions if the structure under investigation is better visualized there).\nGo to Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast and click on Reset.\nIn the Brightness/Contrast (B&C) window, use the scroll bars to change two parameters, Minimum and Maximum values, to discern the structure under investigation clearly.\n\t\tNOTE: Generally, the Minimum value is set to be close to the average value in empty areas, and the Maximum is set to be close to the maximum in the image. Those values can be inferred from the displayed histogram (Figure 2A). If the imaging workstation is color-calibrated, the minimum value can be set slightly higher to hide more background signals.\nIn the Brightness/Contrast (B&C) window, click on Set and select Propagate to all other Open Images checkbox in the popup window Set Display Range.",
    "NOTE: This operation applies the same brightness/contrast settings (including the minimum & maximum values) to all opened images so that the images can be cross-compared.\nLook across different images and scroll through the z-stack in each. If the images look good with a proper dark background and little overblown saturations, write down the Minimum and Maximum settings.\nFor multichannel images, pick image display settings for each channel:\n\t\nGo to Image > Color > Channels Tool, select the Greyscale mode in the popup window Channels.\nGo through each channel, pick the proper Brightness/Contrast for that channel, and write down the settings.\nWith the Brightness/Contrast adjusted, go back to the Channels window and change to Composite mode for simultaneous visualization of multiple channels.\n\t\tNOTE: The pseudo color for each channel can be manually changed in Channels to suit personal preference. The checkboxes are for showing/hiding particular channels.\nIf needed, use the checkboxes in the Channels window to show or hide particular channels.\nIf desired, generate stack projections by going to Image > Stacks > Z Project.\n\tNOTE: Several projection modes are available. Max intensity is a good choice for quick assessment. The nature of the research should be considered to determine if a particular projection mode or individual slices should be used for quantification. Projection can also be limited to select z-slices to reduce the interference of out-of-focus light.\nScreen for single-copy-integration transformants.\n\t\nOnce the same Brightness/Contrast settings are applied across all opened images, compare the image intensities across samples to infer plasmid integration number.",
    "NOTE: Images should be acquired by following the general procedure for single time point imaging, beginning with overnight culturing in a liquid medium. Multi-copy integrations (See colony 2 & 3 in Figure 2B for examples) look substantially brighter than single-copy ones (colony 1 in Figure 2B). In contrast, single-copy ones look similar to each other (Figure 2B).\nExamine images from eight transformants for each strain, ensuring to use the same Brightness/Contrast settings.\nRe-streak and save three or more single-copy transformants for subsequent study.\nExport images for presentation.\n\t\nGo to Image > Duplicate to make a copy of the image of interest, and give it a name of choice.\nGo to Image > Type > 8-bit to convert the duplicate copy from 16-bit to 8-bit and save it as needed.\n\t\tNOTE: Be aware that once this is applied, if the Brightness/Contrast settings are not written down previously, there is no easy way of retrieving that information, and thus no easy way of re-applying the same setting in subsequent image visualizations. This is also the reason why the previous duplication operation is recommended.\nTo split a z stack into a collection of individual images, go to Image > Stacks > Stack to Images and save as needed.\n\t\tNOTE: Images can also be cropped to a smaller area in Fiji.\nSubscription Required.
