    "Ethics statement: All procedures described in this protocol were developed and tested following ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of the Psychology Department of Bologna University (see also the Declaration of Helsinki23,53).\n1. Participants\nSelect a sample of healthy young adult females.\n\t\nRecruit participants who are not on a diet, not taking psychoactive drugs, free of current or past psychiatric or neurological illness as determined by history, and na√Øve as to the purpose of the experiment.\nInvite volunteers to sit in a quiet room and collect their demographics, including gender, age, level of education, fasting hours, and height and weight.\nCalculate participants' body mass index (BMI)45,54,55.\n2. Hunger and Motivation Ratings\nCollect subjects' self-ratings about their feeling of hunger at that very moment on an 11-point Likert scale56,57.\nUse a similar scale as the one used in the previous step for self-rating the motivation to consume at that very moment six foods, one by one. Choose these foods among those with high appetitive value58-62 in the female population (based on the cultural context).\n\t\nDisplay the six foods in pictures, randomly, by using a slide show presentation program, so that their appearance and size match as much as possible those in the real word.\n3. Food Stimuli Selection\nSelect, individually for each participant, the two highest rated food items in the previous step.\n\t\nMake sure, at the group level, that participants are equally motivated to eat the two foods, namely, that there is no significant difference between the two items in the motivation rating (see steps 2.2 and 2.2.1).\n4. Errors as a Way to Enhance Cognitive Control\nUse the Error task24 modified as follows to associate the two preselected stimuli with two different error rates.",
    "Program and run the task with an appropriate stimulus delivery software, such as E-Prime. The task should last at least 15 min. See Supplemental Code Files for an example script.\nInclude two conditions in which one predicts (i.e., it cues) a Low probability of committing an Error (LE), namely, in which participants will make a small number of errors, and one predicts a High probability of committing an Error (HE), namely, in which participants will make a larger number of errors (see steps 4.5.2 and 4.5.3).\n\t\nUse one of the two preselected food items as the cue for the LE condition (LEFood); use the other food item as the cue for the HE condition (HEFood). Intersperse, randomly, the same number of trials for both conditions.\nSet the task so that each trial starts with a grayscale picture of one of the two food items, that, after 1,000 msec, becomes colored (Go signal), thus requiring the subject to respond.\n\t\nFor 33% of the total number of trials, superimpose a red circle on the colored image (Stop signal) after a variable stop-signal delay (SSD) (see section 4.4) relative to the Go signal onset, thus requiring the subject not to respond.\nOnce the Stop signal appears, leave both Go and Stop signals on the screen for a maximum response time of 1,000 msec after the Go signal onset (time window in which subjects are allowed to respond).\nAfter giving a feedback (see step 4.4.), separate the trials with a blank screen of variable interstimulus interval (500-2,000 msec).\nInstruct participants to respond to the Go signal as quickly as possible via button press, and to refrain when a Stop signal occurs. Instruct them about all possible feedback (i.e., ''Correct!'', ''Error!'', ''Too early!'').",
    "Define the error likelihoods for the LE and the HE conditions by changing their SSDs independently, by the means of a staircase algorithm, based on participant's performance. The LE has shorter SSDs, whereas the HE has longer SSDs24.\n\t\nStart the SSD at 200 msec in both LE and HE after the first Go signal onset.\nDuring the LE, increase the SSD by 5 msec on the subsequent trial if the subject succeeds in avoiding the button press after the Stop signal; decrease the SSD by 50 msec on the subsequent trial if the subject fails.\nDuring the HE, increase the SSD by 50 msec on the next trial if the subject succeeds, otherwise, decrease the SSD by 50 msec on the next trial if the subject fails63.\nFor the analyses, compare Go and Stop trials and LE and HE conditions for accuracy and response time24. Do not consider missed responses. Use Statistica or any other statistical software to analyze the data.\n5. Intertemporal Choice as a Measure of Cognitive Control\nAdminister participants two Temporal Discounting tasks, separately and in a counterbalanced order, soon after the Error task ends (see below for details). Measure in one Temporal Discounting task the subjective value for the LEFood, and in the other the subjective value for the HEFood. Run the tasks on E-Prime or any other stimulus delivery software. See Supplemental Code Files for an example script.\n\t\nIn each task, present participants, on each trial, a choice between 40 units of fictive food25,64,65 that can be obtained after a variable delay (i.e., 2 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year, for a total of six delay conditions25,66,67) and a smaller amount of the same food available in the immediate present.",
    "Include five choices in each delay condition. Deliver blocks of choices pertaining to the six delay conditions in a random order across subjects.\nInstruct participants to make a choice between the two options by imagining to receive the specified amount of reward at the specified time, and to indicate their preference by pressing one of two buttons25,68.\n\t\nMake clear to participants that they are making choices toward hypothetical foods; there are no correct or incorrect choices but they are free to choose the option they prefer the most; they have no time limit to decide, but they should make their choice as soon as they feel to prefer one reward more than the other.\nProgram the tasks so that, for each delay condition, the amount of the smaller-immediate option is adjusted, trial by trial, based on participants' previous choice, using a titration procedure that converges on the amount of the immediate reward that has equivalent subjective value as the delayed reward25,67 (see steps 5.3.1 to 5.3.5).\n\t\nFirst, always submit participants, for each delay condition, to a choice between 20 units (bites) of food available \"now\" and 40 units of the same food available at that specific delay67, so that, in the first trial of each delay condition participants always face a choice between these two specific amounts67.\nThen, decrease, after the first choice, the amount of the smaller option on the next trial if participant chose the smaller option in the previous trial, otherwise increase the amount of the smaller option on the next trial if the participant chose the larger option in the previous trial.",
    "Reduce the size of the adjustment of the smaller option with successive choices: The first adjustment is half of the difference between the smaller and the larger rewards, whereas for subsequent choices it is half of the previous adjustment23.\nRepeat the procedure in the above step until the participant has made five choices at one specific delay condition, after which the participant begins a new series of choices at another delay condition.\nFor each trial in a block, consider the smaller immediate amount as the best guess as to the subjective value of the larger later reward. Therefore, take the immediate amount that would have been presented on the sixth trial of a delay block as the estimate of the subjective value of the later reward at that delay and use it for the analysis (i.e., the so-called indifference point; see step 5.6)25.\nFit, through nonlinear, least-squares analysis, the hyperbolic equation V = 1/(1 + kT) (i.e., V = subjective value; k = constant of the best fitting; T = time delay in days) to participants' indifference points23, independently for each Temporal Discounting task. Do this in order to calculate the discount rate (k) of the subjective value for each reward under consideration as a function of time69-71. Use Statistica or any other statistical software to perform this non-linear estimation.\nLog-transform k values in order to normalize data, and then run parametric analyses23,25.\n\tNote: A larger k value corresponds to a steeper discounting function, thereby indicating that the subjects are more inclined to choose the smaller-immediate option over the larger later one.",
    "Compare the k values for the LEFood and the HEFood by correcting for hunger rating, self-report questionnaire score of sensitivity to external edible cues (see step 6), and BMI45,54,55. Use Statistica or any other statistical software to analyze the data.\n6. External Eating Behavior Subscale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQEEB)\nUse the DEBQEEB72 to measure volunteers' sensitivity to external edible cues, to control for possible confounding during the experiment.\n7. Debriefing\nDebrief participants as to the purpose of the experiment at the end of the session. Ask them if they were somehow aware of the error manipulation during the Error task and if they think they chose somehow in a different way during the Temporal Discounting tasks according to the two different foods.\n\tNote: Any impressions or feelings about the entire procedure (e.g., whether they think there was an association between the two main tasks) are welcome.\nSubscription Required.
