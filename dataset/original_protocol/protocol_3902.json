    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nObtaining brain slices\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step is crucial for obtaining viable brain slices. Ice-cold NMDG (cutting) solution is used for transcardial perfusion and cutting in the chamber of the vibratome. Brain slices are incubated first in NMDG solution (33.5°C) for 11 min and then in normal extracellular solution (33.5°C) for 50 min (or less) and finally in normal extracellular solution at room temperature (∼22°C–24°C) until recording (30°C–32°C). Gentle and skillful handling of the brain tissue is important. The cutting process (from tanscardial perfusion to brain slices in incubating chamber) should be short (typically 20–25 min).\nGeneral preparation\nSurgical tools: Scalpel, flat spatula, broad spatula (curved), hemostat, forceps, operating scissors (small), operating scissors (large) suitable for cutting tissues and bones. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H)\nRazor blade: Wash thoroughly with powdered detergent free of residue. Rinse again with 70% alcohol and deionized water. Fold and break the two-edged blades into separate two blades, one blade for the vibratome, the other for trimming the brain block.\nGlue: Krazy glue. It is quick to dry. Be careful to cap the tube properly.\nIncubating solutions: Place a small beaker holding 150 mL of NMDG solution in an incubating water bath at 33.5°C. Place another similar sized beaker holding 150 mL of normal extracellular solution in the same bath. We use home-made mesh baskets immersed in solution (1 cm deep) for keeping brain slices in both solutions (see below). Solutions are bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.",
    "Cutting solution: Take out cooled cutting solution (NMDG) from −20°C and stir to obtain an ice water mix (∼1/4 ice particles in the solution). Pour 50 mL into the perfusion reservoir at a height ∼0.5 m above the mouse. Pour 50 mL in a 100×15 mm petri dish which sits on a box of crushed ice.\nAnesthetics: isoflurane\nVibratome (Leica VT 1200S): Pack crushed ice around cutting chamber. Put the metal plate (brain-block is to be glued to this plate) in the chamber to cool down.\nTranscardial perfusion and brain block\nAnesthetize the mouse in a small closely sealed plexiglass box using 0.3 mL isoflurane. For added protection, this can be done in a fume hood or with an anesthesia gas veterinary scavenging system (Patterson Scientific, WI) to avoid exposure of the experimenter to the anesthetics. Once the mouse exhibits a slowed breathing rate and little response to a hindpaw pinch, remove the animal from the box and insert the nose of the mouse into a small tube (diameter 2 cm) containing cotton balls dabbed with a small amount of isoflurane (0.1–0.2 mL) to keep the mouse being anesthetized.\nPin the front pawns. Open thoracic chest with operating scissors (large) to expose the heart (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I). Puncture the left ventricle with the perfusion needle (21 gauge) for perfusing NMDG cutting solution (bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2) through the heart to the whole body and at same time cut the right atrium to drain blood (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I). When the fluid exiting the heart becomes white (clear), normally after ∼10–15 mL of perfusion, stop perfusion and decapitate the mouse with large operating scissors.",
    "Cut the front and left side of the skull in the cold cutting solution of the 100×15 mm petri dish, flip the skull (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]J), and gently remove the brain from the skull cavity using a flat spatula. Place the brain on the cold metal plate and block the brain according to the brain region of interest. In our case, we record in the prefrontal cortex, and thus we cut the brain coronally into two parts, an anterior and a posterior block at roughly the middle of the brain. Place brain blocks back into the cutting solution.\nClean the metal plate. Paint a thin layer of Krazy glue and put the anterior block of the brain containing the PrL on the glue with the cutting surface down (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]K).\nPlace the metal plate with the brain block in the chamber of the vibratome. Pour the rest of the cutting solution into the chamber (bubbling with 95% O2 and 5% CO2) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]L).\nObtaining brain slices\nSet Vibratome blade front and back cutting limit. Cut brain block cortex surface first at a speed of 0.14 mm/s and amplitude of 1 mm.\nCoronal slices containing the part of the brain of interest (e.g., the PrL) are collected. The thickness of the brain slices (200–500 μm) is determined by brain location and experimental design. We recorded from 300 μm slices containing the right side PrL. For PrL recording, we collect the right side of the coronal brain sections by physically separating the left and right sides of the brain (left and right are separable at this location due to the absence of the corpus callosum). For other brain areas such as the periaqueductal gray, to mark the sides of the slices, make a cut on the non-recording side of the slice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]M).",
    "One slice is collected every minute at this cutting speed. Slices are first placed in the NMDG beaker at 33.5°C, then transferred to normal extracellular solution at 33.5°C after 11 min. Count the time for each slice. Finally move the beaker with normal extracellular solution from the water bath (33.5°C) to room temperature (50 min timed from the first slice that was collected into the NMDG beaker). After approximately 1hr at room temperature, slices are ready to be used for electrophysiological recording.\nCritical: 1. Ice-cold cutting solution for transcardial perfusion and slice cutting in vibratome chamber is critical for obtaining viable brain slices. 2. Gentle and skillful handling of brain tissues is also helpful in maintaining healthy brain slices.\nWhole-cell patch clamp\nTiming: 4–5 h\nWhole-cell patch clamp is the gold standard for studying neuronal function and synaptic transmission in acute brain slices. Blue LED light (Thorlabs NJ), Multiclamp recording system (700B amplifier and DigiData 1440A digitizer) and software (pClamp electrophysiology data acquisition & analysis suite) (Molecular Devices, CA) are used to induce and record the optically evoked excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic current (oEPSCs and oIPSCs) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]N).\nGeneral preparation\nIntracellular solution: Pipette solution should be at room temperature for at least 30 min to completely thaw before use. The needle used to fill patch pipette should be clean. A Millex®-GV syringe filter unit (0.22 μm) is used to filter the Intracellular solution.\nPull glass pipettes: A glass pipette puller (Zeitz-Instruments Germany) is used to pull and polish glass pipettes (Borosilicate glass, Sutter Instrument). Tip resistance should be around 4–6 MΩ.",
    "Perfusion solution: extracellular solution is added to perfusion reservoir and bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The solution passes through an inline solution heater (Warner Instruments, MA) to keep solutions in patching chamber at 30°C–32°C. Flow rate of perfusion solution is 1.5–2 mL/min.\nAir table: is used to keep patch rig free from vibration. Turn on before experiment.\nWhole-cell Voltage Clamp recording of evoked postsynaptic current: To identify recorded neurons, a Xenon short arc lamp and filter set for tdTomato (Excitation 554/Emission 581) were used to illuminate and observe tdTomato fluorescence signal in cell bodies of the labeled neurons. We recorded from layer 5 PV GABAergic interneurons of the PrL in brain slices from PV-Cre::tdTomato mice and glutamatergic neurons of the PrL in brain slices from Vglut2-Cre::tdTomato mice. We also recorded from layer 5 putative glutamatergic neurons in paired recordings of both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the same brain slices. To activate axon terminals of the BLA-PrL projections in the PrL, we injected AAV (AAV5-CaMKIIα-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP) in the BLA and activated ChR2-expressing input fibers using LED light.\nTransfer one brain slice to the recording chamber perfused with normal extracellular solution (30°C–32°C). Place an anchor on top to stabilize the slice.\nLower the tip of the optic fiber (200 μm core, 0.22 NA) into the recording solution and aim at the area to be recorded. The tip of the fiber is normally at around 100–300 μm away from recorded cells. The optic fiber is connected to an LED (Thorlabs, NJ) to deliver blue light. It may also be possible to use whole field illumination to activate the opsin.\nFill patch pipette with Cs based intracellular solution for voltage clamp. Apply slight positive pressure to pipette before lowering into solution.",
    "Alternatives: Symmetrical Cl− solution (with equal Cl− in intracellular and external) could be used for recording IPSC and potassium based internal solution (gluconate or methanesulfonate salt) could be used for EPSC. Membrane potential is held at −70 mV in both conditions.\nTurn on pClamp acquisition/analysis software, and Multiclamp 700B commander software.\nIdentify a fluorescent cell with clear contour using a 40× water immersion objective. Bring the electrode tip close to the cell to be patched using DIC mode. Press electrode onto the cell at 1/3 of the cell body using slow speed until an obvious dimple is formed on the cell. Release positive pressure of the electrode and apply a subtle negative pressure or voltage (−70 mV) to help the seal. In Clampex software change from Bath to Patch, a −70 mV voltage is applied to cell automatically. Once a Giga-ohm seal is formed, apply a slight suction to break into whole cell patch configuration.\nPerform Capacitance and Access resistance compensation. Sampling rate is set at 20 k/s and holding potential at −70 mV. Wait for 7–10 min for the cell to settle down and start to record.\nApply one blue light pulse (5–10 ms) every sweep (5 s/per sweep) every 20 s. Increase light power from low to high intensity to find a threshold intensity which can induce an inward (downward) response (-oEPSC) when the holding potential is set at −70 mV (GABAA receptor reversal potential) or an outward (upward) response (oIPSC) if holding potential is set at 0 mV (AMPA receptor reversal potential).",
    "Note: 1. Temperature in the recording chamber (30°C–32°C) and the distance of the stimulating optic fiber to the recorded cells as well as light intensity all affect the amplitude of the postsynaptic response. They should be kept constant throughout the experiments. 2. When recording one of the postsynaptic currents, the holding potential is chosen at the reversal potential of the other postsynaptic current species to minimize interference. This is especially true when no blockers of that current are added to the perfusate. The reversal potential can be estimated using the Nernst equation if only one ion species is permeable for that channel, or by using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation if there are more than two permeant ions. Due to the existence of a liquid junction potential between the patch pipette and bath solution (at the interface between intracellular solution and external solution) when the pipette is in bath and offsetting (zeroing) of pipette current during patching, a small voltage error can be introduced into the recording after establishing the whole-cell configuration (where there no longer is a liquid junction potential). This must be considered when interpreting data. In our case, we did not correct junction potentials. Both the IPSC reversal potential (for Cl−, −70 mV) and EPSC reversal potential (for Na+, K+ and Cs, 0 mV) are calculated (−69.5 mV and 2.8 mV, respectively) and we verified this in real experiments. 3. High intracellular Cl− may affect other cellular processes and IPSC decay time course, which should be taken into consideration when using symmetrical Cl− intracellular solution to record IPSCs at resting membrane potentials.",
    "Determine monosynaptic connections: To confirm ChR2 induced depolarization of axon terminals and release of neurotransmitters is action potential dependent, we apply the sodium channel blocker TTX in the perfusion solution. To confirm that neurotransmitter release occurs in a monosynaptic (direct) connection, both TTX and 4-AP, a K+ channel blocker, are perfused to block action potential dependent polysynaptic transduction, to depolarize opsin-expressing axon terminals and to restore the synaptic connection and neurotransmitter release (Cho et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Little and Carter, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Petreanu et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Here we recorded in both PV GABAergic interneurons (PV-Cre::tdTomato mice) and glutamatergic neurons (Vglut2-Cre::tdTomato mice) to confirm that the BLA inputs form synaptic connections with both neuronal types.\nHold the membrane potential at −70 mV. Increase the LED blue light power (by increasing current amplitude and/or pulse duration) to more than threshold intensity (e.g., double threshold intensity) to get a 50–500 pA oEPSC without inducing massive compound electrical activity.\nWhen the amplitude of oEPSC stabilizes after a baseline recording (10 min), apply TTX (1 μM) in perfusate. If the oEPSC is action potential dependent, it should gradually decrease and eventually disappear (∼ 7–10 min).\nApply the K+ channel blocker 4-AP (100 μM) in the presence of TTX (1 μM) and record for 10 min. If an oEPSC reappears, presynaptic glutamate release is restored. This indicates that the ChR2 expressing terminals have synaptic contact with the recorded postsynaptic neurons.",
    "In separate experiments before application of TTX and/or 4-AP, we recorded optically evoked oEPSCs (at – 70 mV) and oIPSCs (at 0 mV) in glutamatergic neurons to analyze the latency of the oEPSC (monosynaptic) and the oIPSC (disynaptic) (see section 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and section 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#resource-availability]), and recorded neuronal response to high frequency (20 Hz) light stimulation to further confirm the monosynaptic nature of the BLA to the PrL glutamatergic neuron input\nNote: A monosynaptic connection is characterized by constant short latency, low jitter (jitter: variability of latency, represented by Standard Deviation or SD of the latency) and the ability to follow 20 Hz (light) stimulation without missing time-locked responses (Doyle and Andresen, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Ji et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). These characteristics distinguish mono- from polysynaptic connections and can be easily tested by using the appropriate pClamp protocol and further verified by above experiments (step 6).\nDetermine relative synaptic strength of BLA input to GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons: Selective opsin expression in BLA glutamatergic input is achieved using a glutamatergic neuron specific promoter (CaMKIIα) virus. However, variability in virus expression may compound the accurate quantification of synaptic strength (i.e., amplitude of oEPSCs). To overcome this we recorded oEPSCs in GABAergic and glutamatergic pairs (adjacent cells within 100–200 μm that may share similar input and output features and presumably express opsin at similar levels) in the same brain slices from SNI and Sham mice. LED light is used to achieve more stable mono-wavelength light source than most other available ones such as diode pumped solid state (DPSS) lasers.",
    "Record oEPSCs in fluorescent PV GABAergic and non-fluorescent large pyramidal putative glutamatergic neuronal pairs in layer 5 of the PrL of the same brain slices either from SNI or Sham PV-Cre::tdTomato mice (PV-Cre x ai9 crosses). We recorded in PV GABAergic and in glutamatergic neurons in alternate order.\nUse same LED light power for all cells and brain slices. When the amplitude of the oEPSC stabilizes after a baseline recording (10 min), apply TTX and K+ channel blocker 4-AP to restore presynaptic glutamate release and wait for drugs to take full effects (10 min). Measure the amplitude of the restored oEPSC in both PV GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons from the same brain slices. The ratio of oEPSCs from both neurons is used for analysis to eliminate opsin expression variation among different slices and mice as a confounding factor.\nDetermine E/I balance in layer 5 output neurons of the PrL: Like in other cortical regions, layer 5 output neurons of the PrL integrate inputs from excitatory and inhibitory sources before sending output information to other brain centers. E/I balance is important to determine the strength of layer 5 neuronal output. To assess the relative contribution of the BLA direct monosynaptic excitatory and BLA derived disynaptic inhibitory (feedforward inhibition) inputs, we recorded oEPSCs (holding −70 mV) and oIPSCs (holding 0 mV) in the same layer 5 output neurons across brain slices from either SNI and Sham mice .\nRecord light-evoked oEPSC at a holding potential of −70 mV (IPSC or Cl− reversal potential) for 5–10 min to obtain stabilized recording. Switch to a holding potential of 0 mV (EPSC reversal potential) to record the oIPSC in the same layer 5 output neurons of the PrL for another 5–10 min. We used Vglut2-Cre::tdTomato mice (Vglut2-Cre x Ai9 cross).",
    "Measure the amplitude both oEPSC and oIPSC from the same neurons. The ratio between oEPSC and oIPSC from each neuron recorded in SNI and Sham mice is used for analysis to cancel out opsin expression variation among different slices and mice.\nAt the end of each recording, apply DNQX (10 μM) and AP-5 (50 μM) to block the oEPSC to confirm glutamate release. The disappearance of the oIPSC after application of oEPSC blockers suggests that the oIPSC is secondary to the oEPSC and that the oIPSC is due to feedforward inhibition.\nNote: Bicuculine, TTX or 4-AP were not included in the extracellular solution in experiments described in section “Determine E/I balance in layer 5 output neurons of the PrL”.\nCritical: 1. An LED light source is recommended due to its stability compared to the most available powerful DPSS laser light. Strong (light) stimulation could cause polysynaptic and complex compound electrical responses, and should be avoided. 2. In experiments determining the relative synaptic strength (Step 7), voltage clamp is performed in a solution containing bicuculine (10 μΜ), TTX (1 μΜ), and 4-AP (100 μΜ) to ensure a monosynaptic connection. To assess input-output relations of synaptic transmission, the amplitude of the oEPSC in re-established synapses can be used for analysis, but for paired pulse ratio assessment, intact action potential dependent release is necessary to examine the function of presynaptic release, and thus the above strategy cannot be used (not shown in this protocol). 3. In experiments for determination of E/I balance (Step 8), neither bicuculine, TTX nor 4-AP are added to solution to keep polysynaptic conduction."
