If not, extend the incubation time.\nAdd CDF12 medium in an equal volume of TrypLE and pipette up and down several times to resuspend cells.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 5 min and remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL EPS medium.\nRemove MEFs by differential attachment:\nTransfer cell resuspension to a gelatin-coated 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for 1 h (MEF cells attached to the plate while EPS cells were still floating in suspension).\nNote: MEFs attach faster than EPS cells. After 1 h incubation, check the plate under a microscope to ensure that most MEFs are depleted from the suspension. MEF cells are easy to distinguish as they are much bigger than EPS cells.\nCollect cell suspension and filter it through a 45 μm cell strainer to eliminate cell aggregates.\nCount cells using the Bio-Rad TC-10 counter or a hemocytometer.\nNote: Bio-Rad TC10 counter requires a cell density at 1 × 105–5 × 106 cells/mL for optimal counting results. We usually count 2–3 times and calculate the mean as the readout.\nCritical: The cells should be healthy and surviving well at the end of the procedure. The percentage of live cells must be greater than 80% according to trypan blue staining. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nAggregate EPS cells for blastoid formation\nTiming: 5–7 days",
    "Next, we seed the dissociated EPS cells into microwells for the formation of small cell aggregates and subsequently EPS-blastoids.\nCalculate the volume for the required number of cells.\nNote: We routinely prepare cells enough for (N+1) wells (N is the number of wells to be seeded) to offset the pipetting loss.\nCritical: Cell seeding density is critical to the efficiency of blastoid formation. Typically, we seed an average of 5 cells/microwell in AggreWell 400. As each well of the AggreWell 400 24-well plate contains about 1,200 microwells, 6,000 cells are needed per well. For 6-well plate which contains about 7,000 microwells per well, 35,000 cells are needed. Also, depending on the accuracy of the cell count and the cell line difference, the optimal cell seeding number may vary. Therefore, we recommend testing a cell seeding density series (2 to 10 cells per microwell) to identify the optimal seeding density.\nPrepare a sufficient amount of cell seeding medium as mentioned in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nMix cells with medium, and pipette 500 μL into each well of the AggreWell 400 24-well plate or 2 mL for the AggreWell 400 6-well plate.\nShake the plate and spin down at 200 g for 2 min.\nNote: Shake the plate back and forth or from left to right. Never swirl it.\nCheck cells under a microscope to ensure that cells sit at the bottom of the microwells and are evenly distributed in all of the microwells.\nNote: If cells are not evenly distributed, pipette several times with a wide bore pipette tip to resuspend the cells and centrifuge again.\nOn the next day, check cell culture under the microscope. The cells in each microwell should form a compact aggregate at this time.",
    "Critical: Early signs of the compaction process can be seen as early as 4 h after cell seeding. If cells are still dispersed after 24 h of cell seeding, they are most likely dead. This can be due to excessive pipetting or over-digestion. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nRemove medium by tilting the plate slightly and aspirating medium with a P200 tip by gently placing the tip against the edge between the side and the bottom (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/930-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A diagram illustrating the placement of the tips for removing the medium and avoiding disturbance of the cells in the microwells\nReplace with blastoid induction medium (see recipe in “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”, 500 μL for AggreWell 400 24-well plate).\nOptional: Further medium change is optional. If the medium becomes acidic (yellow in color), or extended culturing is desired, additional medium change is necessary.\nCheck the culture daily to monitor the progress. EPS-blastoids usually emerge from Day 3 to Day 5. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nEPS-blastoid picking\nTiming: 1–2 h\nEPS-blastoids are identified and picked up for further experimentations or analyses. We identified the blastoids as having a cavitated sphere-like structure. The structures are round shaped or near round shaped with a diameter of 60–170 μm. These cavitated structures are easy to spot under a stereo microscope.\nUsing wide bore pipette tips to blow off the blastoid from the microwells by gently pipetting up and down.\nNote: Gentle pipetting is strongly recommended to minimize blastoid breakage. The use of wide-bore pipette tips helps minimize the shearing pressure on EPS-blastoids during pipetting and maintains integrity.\nTransfer the EPS-blastoid culture into a 6-well plate for picking. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nNote: Alternatively, P35 dish or Nunc 4-Well dishes for IVF can be used.\nPlace the stereo microscope inside a biosafety cabinet and disinfect.",
    "Place the plate containing the EPS-blastoid culture under the microscope.\nUse a mouth pipette with a hand-pulled glass microcapillary pipettes to pick up EPS-Blastoids.\nNote: Mouth pipette is routinely used to manipulate embryos. We used an aspirator tube assembly (Sigma-Aldrich, A5177) and attached a pulled glass microcapillary pipette. Note that the diameter of the opening in the glass pipette should be slightly larger than the maximum size of the embryo (∼170 μm). Pre-wetting the glass pipette with 1% BSA in PBS helps reduce the chances of EPS-blastoids sticking to the glass.\nAlternatives: Other pipetting equipment, such as the P10 or P200 pipette, should also be OK to use for picking up and washing blastoids. Pre-wetting the pipette tips with 1% BSA in PBS helps reduce the chances of EPS-blastoids to stick to the tips.\nPlace the pooled EPS-Blastoids into two drops of PBS successively for washing.\nUse EPS-blastoid for immunostaining analysis or further culturing:\nTransfer the EPS-Blastoid into a drop of 4% PFA for fixation and further immunostaining analysis.\nPause point: Fixed EPS-Blastoids can be stored in PBS at 4°C for months.\nTransfer EPS-blastoids onto an ibidi μ-plate for further culturing using the IVC1/IVC2 or a similar culture system.\nEPS-blastoids implantation\nTiming: 2–3 h\nTransfer manually picked EPS-blastoid into the mouse uterus for further experimentations or analysis.\nPick up EPS-blastoids manually and transfer them into a KSOM drop using a mouth pipette.\nAnesthetized the ICR female surrogate (2–4 months old) at 2.5 days post coitum (dpc) with ketamine (Putney, 100 mg/kg, dissolved in saline at 10 mg/mL) and xylazine (Akorn, 16 mg/kg, dissolved in saline at 1.6 mg/mL).\nExpose the uterine horn surgically and punctured it with a 27G needle.\nWashes EPS-blastoids three times in KSOM drops.",
    "Loaded EPS-blastoids into the pipette and transfer them to the uterine horn through the puncture.\nNote: Around 20 EPS-blastoids were transferred into each uterine horn. The process of transfer was typically performed within 20–30 min per surrogate.\nSacrifice the surrogate and performed Caesarean section (C-section) at 6.5, 7.5, or 8.5 dpc, and dissected out the uterus. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nNote: To stain the decidua, we inject 0.5% Evans Blue (MP Biomedicals, 151108) into the tail vein of the surrogate mice and wait for 15 min before starting the C-section.\nDissected deciduae out of the uterus, and dissect embryo-like structures out of the deciduae.\nFixed tissue samples with 4% PFA overnight (14–16 h) and embedded in the O.C.T compound.\nCut Frozen sections (10 mm thick) using a microtome cryostat (Leica, model# CM1900-3-1).\nPause point: Sections can be stored at −20°C or lower for months.\nPerform immunostaining on the sections."
