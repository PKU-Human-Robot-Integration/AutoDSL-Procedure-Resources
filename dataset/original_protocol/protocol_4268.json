    "D, L-Amino acids are bound with OPA, and NAC (Aswad, 1984) or NBC (Hashimoto et al., 1992) using two methanolic solutions (A and B) containing the derivatizing reagents (see Notes 1-3). This derivatization results in fluorescent diastereomers. Methanolic solution A is prepared by dissolving 8 mg of OPA and 10 mg of NAC in 1 ml of methanol, while methanolic solution B is prepared by dissolving 10 mg of OPA and 10 mg of NBC in 1 ml of methanol. These methanolic solution A and B are not light sensitive.   The reaction mixture (250 μl) for the derivatization contains 25 μl of amino acid sample, 50 μl of methanolic solution (A or B) and 175 μl of 0.4 M sodium borate buffer (pH 10.4) in a sample vial. Vortex the reaction mixture. To choose the correct methanolic solution for your sample, see Notes 2 and 3.   After fluorescence derivatization for 2 min at room temperature in the dark, set the sample vial on vial holder in ACQUITY sample manager of UPLC system. Introduction of an aliquot (1 μl) of the reaction mixture into a UPLC system is performed automatically. Because the fluorescence derivatives are unstable, the introduction of an aliquot into a UPLC system should be performed immediately after the incubation.    The system is operated at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at 30 °C. The UPLC gradient system for analysis of OPA-NAC derivatives [A = 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.9) and B = methanol] is 10-20% B for 3.2 min, 20% B for 1 min, 20-40% B for 3.6 min, 40% B for 1.2 min, 40-60% B for 3.8 min, 60% B for 1 min and 60-10% B for 0.01 min, and then the system is equilibrated with 90% A and 10% B for 4.19 min. About 4.",
    "0 ml of A and about 2.7 ml of B are needed for the analysis of one sample. The gradient system for analysis of OPA-NBC derivatives [A = 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.9) and B = acetonitrile] is 15-21% B for 7 min, 21-27.5% B for 1.5 min, 27.5% B for 2 min, 27.5-30% B for 1 min, 30-40% B for 2 min, 40% B for 0.5 min and 40-15% B for 0.01 min, and then the system is equilibrated with 85% A and 15% B for 3.99 min. About 3.8 ml of A and about 1.8 ml of B are needed for the analysis of one sample. The excitation and emission wavelengths for fluorescent detection of the diastereoisomeric amino acid derivatives are 350 nm and 450 nm, respectively. Before the first analysis, the system is pre-equilibrated with the equilibration condition described above for 16 min.   The data is processed using Empower 2 that is control and analysis software for a UPLC system. The peak heights and retention times are used for amino acid quantification and identification, respectively (see Note 4). In the case of analysis for biological sample, identification of amino acid is performed based on retention times of amino acids provided from analysis of a control amino acid sample run alongside.   The standard solution for calibration curves consists of 4 mM 32 kinds of amino acids: D- and L-forms of aspartate (Asp), glutamtamate (Glu), serine (Ser), alanine (Ala), leucine (Leu), phenylalanine (Phe), valine (Val), methionine (Met), tryptophan (Trp), arginine (Arg), histidine (His), threonine (Thr), asparagine (Asn), tyrosine (Tyr) and glutamine (Gln), plus L-isoleucine (L-Ile) and D-allo-isoleucine (D-allo-Ile). The standard solution was　diluted to 7 concentrations (5, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 μM) in 0.",
    "05 M HCl, after which the solutions were filtered through polytetrafluoroethylene membrane filters (4-mm diameter, 0.2-μm pore size). Based on chromatograms provided from UPLC analysis of each concentration of the standard solution, calibration curves of D or L-amino acid are calculated plotting peak height versus content of amino acid. The calculation of equation of a calibration curve and quantification of amino acid in your sample are performed using Empower 2 software."
