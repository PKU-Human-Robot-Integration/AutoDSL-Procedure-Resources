    "1. Equipment and Reagents Created In-house (See List of Materials for Others)\nPrepare a Drosophila cold anesthesia apparatus as previously described 8.\nPrepare a fly aspirator as previously described 13.\nPrepare social space chambers and holders.\n\t\nOrder or make glass panes and acrylic spacers to create the social space chambers. Each social space chamber consists of two square glass panes (17.6 cm by 17.6 cm, with a thickness of 0.3 cm), two right triangle acrylic spacers (with a height of 16.5 cm, a base of 8.9 cm, with a thickness of 0.3 cm), and two rectangular spaces (9 cm by 1.5 cm with a thickness of 0.3 cm) (Figure 1A).\nAssemble the glass and acrylic social space chamber such that it is identical to the chamber in Figure 1B. To do so, start by placing one triangular spacer flat on top of one square pane of glass such that the right angle of the triangular spacer is aligned with one of the corners of the square pane. Next, place the second triangular spacer flat on top of the square pane, mirroring the first triangular spacer.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure to wear gloves so as not to contaminate the pieces with oils and scents from your hands.\nPlace two small rectangular spacers flat on top of the square pane, along the side of the pane that is not covered. The acrylic spacers on top of the square plane should now form a triangular arena.\nPlace a second square pane of glass on top of the acrylic spacers such that it is aligned above the original pane of glass below.",
    "Use four binder clips to secure the panes and spacers together to form the social space chamber. Place one clip near the corner, over the long side of each of the triangular spacers, securing them inside the glass panes. On these same sides, place a clip in the adjacent corner, over each of the rectangular spacers, securing them inside the glass panes.\nAssemble a support stand and a flask clamp such that the clamp will maintain the social space chamber in an upright position, as the social space chamber rests on its edge on top of the work surface.\nFor each repeat in the experiment, assemble a social space chamber and support stand.\nPrepare a climbing assay response apparatus to check the climbing ability of the flies tested.\n\t\nUse a countercurrent apparatus, as previously described 14,15.\nEnsure homogeneous lighting conditions by performing the experiment on a work surface covered with a white bench cover and in front of a white background.\n2. Preparing the Flies before the Experiment\nMaintain flies in bottles containing standard Drosophila fly food. Keep them in an incubation chamber at 25 °C on a 12 hr light/dark cycle.\nOne to two days prior to the experiment, collect and sex flies under cold anesthesia, as previously described 8.\n\t\nChill the cold anesthesia apparatus at -4 °C. Place flies into 50 ml plastic tubes. Fully submerge the plastic tubes containing flies into ice in an insulated ice bucket, wait at least 5 min for flies to become immobile.\nPlace the flies on the polyethylene sheet of the cold anesthesia apparatus. At RT, use a stereomicroscope to separate males from females. Maintain flies, in groups, in vials containing standard Drosophila fly food, not exceeding 40 flies per vial.",
    "Two hours before the beginning of the experiment, ensure that the temperature of the room where the experiment will be performed is between 24–25 °C and the humidity is approximately 50%.\nTransfer the flies into new vials containing food, and place them for 2 hr on the work surface where the experiment will be performed.\n\tNOTE: For these experiments, the fly strains used were Drosophila melanogaster strains: Canton-Special or Canton-S (CS), w1118Cs10 (or W - w1118 outcrossed 10 times to Canton-S), Oregon and Samarkand flies were all from our laboratory stocks 16; Elwood flies were collected in Fall 2011 in the Elwood neighborhood of Huntington, on Long Island, New York, USA 8. Apart when specified otherwise, the results presented were obtained with Canton-S flies (in shades of red).\n3. Performing the Experiment\nPerform the experiment between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. (Zeitgeber time — the time in hours after the onset of light — of ZT 4 to 7).\nPrepare the social space chamber for the transfer of flies.\n\t\nPlace a social space chamber flat on a work surface, with the side containing rectangular spacers closest to your body.\nRemove one clip nearest your body and slide one rectangular spacer outwards, creating a gap of approximately 1 cm between the rectangular spacers.\nUsing tape and a marker, label the social space chamber in an upper corner with sex, strain, and repeat number. Take care to ensure the tape does not cover part of the inner triangular arena.\nTransfer the flies into the social space chamber.\n\t\nTransfer flies from their vial containing food into a new, empty vial. Aspirate flies from the empty vial and transfer them into the social space chamber.",
    "Inhale to draw the flies into the tip of the aspirator. Place the tip into the 1 cm gap between the rectangular spacers of the social space chamber and exhale at a consistent rate to force the flies into the inner triangular arena.\nImmediately slide the rectangular spacer back into place, closing the base of the inner triangular arena, and place the binder clip back on.\nOn a pounding pad, which is located on different bench than where the experimental work takes place, hold the social space chamber upright such that the rectangular spacers are on the bottom side. Pound three times to ensure all flies have fallen to the bottom of the arena.\n\tNOTE: Due to the acrylic spacer sticking out of the smallest chamber size (Figure 1D), bang elbows on work surface while maintaining a secure hold on apparatus to ensure the flies have fallen to the bottom.\nStart a timer.\nPlace the social space chamber on the work surface and use the support stand and flask clamp to keep it upright. Place a ruler or a sticker of known length flat against the social space chamber, but not covering any part of the inner triangular arena.\n\t\nFor horizontally positioned experiments, do not place the social space chamber in the support stand; instead lay the social space chamber flat on the work surface.\nWhen the flies have settled, usually after around 30 min, take a picture of the social space chamber. Ensure that the frame contains the entire inner triangular arena, the ruler, and the label.\nRepeat the experiment for each genotype and condition (ideally 3 internal replicates and 3 independent repeats).\n4. Analyzing the Social Space Data\nImport the following Macros in ImageJ 17\nImageJ is available here: http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/.",
    "You can create a 'Measure Distances' command in the Plugins menu by saving the macros below in a file named 'Measure_Distances.txt' in the ImageJ/plugins folder, in the macro subfolder, and using the Help>Update Menus command.'\nCopy in a .txt file the macros that are provided in supplementary data and were originally published in 3.\nUpload the pictures to a computer, and open one picture using ImageJ.\n\t\nCreate a scale by drawing a line from the 0 cm to 1 cm marks on the ruler in the picture, and under the Analyze tab, choose the Set Scale feature to set a scale of 1 cm for that distance (same approach for the sticker of known length). Choose the Global option before applying the scale to the picture.\nCrop the picture using the Crop feature under the Image tab such that it includes all of the flies, while removing as much of the rest of the picture as possible.\nMake the picture black and white by choosing 8-bit from the Type option under the Image tab.\nRemove all background noise from the picture by going to the Threshold feature under the Adjust option of the Image tab. Drag the sliders to enhance or remove the contrast so that the body of each fly can be clearly seen without any other markings in the image. If there are markings that are not flies, capture them with the rectangular tool and delete them.\nSet the measurements by using the Set Measurements tool under the Analyze tab. Select Area, Center of Mass, Centroid, and Display Label. Next, choose the Analyze Particles feature under the Analyze tab to create a numbered list of all the black spots representing flies.",
    "When using Analyze particles; set size 0.01-0.1 (do NOT choose pixel unit); circularity 0.00-1.00; show outlines; display results, and add to manager.\nEnsure that each black spot (each particle) is an accurate representation of the flies that are in the original picture, by comparing the numbered list to the original picture.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If some flies that are very close together being counted as one particle, manually draw a white line to separate the two flies on the binary image.\nWhile the list is selected, use the Nearest Neighbor — List Distances macro under the second Macros option in the Plugins tab to create a new list containing the distances, in cm, from each fly to their nearest neighbor.\nCopy the nearest neighbor distances from ImageJ and paste into a column of a spreadsheet program.\n\t\nCompile all of the data from each repeat onto the same spreadsheet and organize by genotype and condition.\nPerform data analysis using statistical software. In this experiment, Graph Pad Prism (version 6 for MacOSX, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, www.graphpad.com) was used to conduct one-way ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis Tests, Tukey’s and Dunnet’s Post-Hoc Tests.\nThe distribution of the distances follows a non parametric distribution 1, and data are represented as box and Tukey’s whiskers (to eliminate outliers).\n5. Climbing Assay (Control Behavior)\nUse a climbing assay as a control to test flies climbing ability 14,15,18.\n\t\nUse the countercurrent apparatus such that three trials can be run in parallel.\nTransfer 50 to 100 naïve flies (flies that have not been tested before) in three different test vials, and snap them into the 1st, 3rd and last slots at the bottom of countercurrent apparatus, with fresh empty vials in the opposite locations.\nPlace fresh, empty vials in the empty slots at the bottom of the apparatus.",
    "Tap down the apparatus three times, such that all the flies are at the bottom of each tube, to initiate the experiment.\nStart the timer for 15 sec (time sufficient for ~100% of 3–7 days old Canton-S to reach the top vial — see Figure 3F).\nSlide the upper portion of the counter-current apparatus, to displace the top vials by one slot.\nCollect flies by tapping the apparatus down, to bring all flies in the bottom vials.\n\t\n1st and 2nd tubes (or 3rd and 4th, 5th and 6th) correspond respectively to the flies that did not reach to top and the flies that reached the top vial.\nCalculate the Performance Index (PI).\n\t\nCount the number of flies in each vial.\nThe PI is the percentage of flies able to climb on the upper tube.\nThe means of the PI follow a normal distribution1, and data are represented as column graphs of mean plus or minus standard error to the mean (SEM).\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, the PI can be calculated as the percentage of flies able to reach the upper part of the lower vial (for older flies, 5 sec is the time sufficient to quantify a difference in climbing ability between infected and non infected 12 days old Canton-S quantified from a still picture: see results). Others have used different measures of performance in startle-induced negative geotaxis, that are also appropriate to quantify climbing ability 19-22.\nSubscription Required.
