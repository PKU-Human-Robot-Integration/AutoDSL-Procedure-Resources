    "1.  Extraction of Target Protein from Cultured Primary Hippocampal Neurons\nBefore harvesting endogenous protein from primary  hippocampal cells, prepare a Lysis Buffer (LB; Table 1) with protease  inhibitors. To 10 ml of lysis buffer, add 0.1 ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride  solution (PMSF) to a final concentration of 10mM, and add 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet.\nPrepare N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) solution (Table 1)  from lyophilized powder. Gently dissolve in 100% EtOH at room temperature (RT). Always  prepare NEM solution fresh for the day of the experiment.\nNext combine the lysis buffer and NEM. Add 0.5 ml of  2M NEM solution to a fresh 50  ml conical tube. Add 20 ml LB over top, and  quickly place LB +NEM (final concentration of 50mM) on a rocking platform at 4 °C to fully mix for 5 min. Always add NEM/EtOH solution first and LB second, so as to properly mix the two.\nRemove cultured neurons from incubator and place on  ice*. Gently remove cellular media, and gently wash twice with cold phosphate  buffered saline (PBS) 1x. Add 300 ml of LB  + 50mM NEM to the first well of hippocampal neurons, and scrape cells using a  disposable cell lifter. Collect the cell lysate, then discharge the lysate into  the next well of that group. Scrape cells within the second well using the cell  lifter, collect, and repeat using a third well, if needed to further  concentrate the lysate.",
    "Collect cell lysate into a pre-cooled (on ice), 1.5 ml  microcentrifuge tube. Repeat step 1.4 using 100   μl of LB  + 50mM NEM to collect any remaining cell lysate. Pass total cell lysate through  a 26½ gauge syringe 5-6 times to aid in mechanical lysis, being  careful to not blow bubbles into the solution. One can instead sonicate for 15  sec on ice, if equipment is available. Nutate cell lysate for ≥30 min at 4 °C.\nClarify the cell lysate by centrifugation at 16,000  x g/ 30 min, in order to pellet un-lysed cells and detergent-insoluble  material.\nCollect cleared cell lysate (supernatant) in a new  pre-cooled 1.5 ml tube on ice. Repeat harvest protocol for all groups of cells.  Measure protein concentration in all lysate samples using BCA assay, and  normalize the volume of all lysate samples from groups of cells to have exactly  equal total protein, with a recommended minimum of 500  μg. Top up all samples with LB + 50mM NEM to 500   μl total volume.\nAdd 1-5  μg of  primary antibody directed against the target protein to each of lysate sample.  Nutate the antibody-lysate mixed samples overnight at 4 °C.\n* Primary rat hippocampal neurons should be  cultured at a density of approximately 250,000 cells/well in a 6-well dish, in a  serum-free media containing a B27 neuronal supplement, as previously described5, and  grown for the desired length of time, typically 14-16 days-in-vitro (DIV) to  achieve maturity. A minimum of 500  μg of  total protein is recommended to successfully immunoprecipitate and biotinylate a  target neuronal protein, which typically requires 2-3 wells of a 6-well dish.\n2.  Precipitation of Antibody-bound Target Protein",
    "Before precipitating and immobilizing a target  protein, prepare a 50% slurry of protein A, or protein G-coated sepharose beads.  Specifically, add ≥60   μl of sepharose beads per sample to 1.5 ml tubes, ensuring that all samples  have equal amounts of beads. Magnetic beads are also suitable if the equipment  is available.\nAdd an equal volume of 50% slurry to each  antibody-lysate sample, and nutate for ≥1 hr  at 4 °C.\n3. Acyl-Biotin Exchange: Hydroxylamine (HAM) Cleavage\nWhile performing step 2.2, prepare a number of  tubes with lysis buffer (LB) of different pHs. The pH is very important for  these steps and should always be adjusted using a pH meter. Prepare 2 ml of LB  pH 7.2 per sample, and 0.5 ml of Stringent Buffer per sample (Table 1). Also  prepare 0.5 ml LB + 10mM NEM per sample, as in steps 1.1-1.3. Add PMSF and  protease inhibitor tablets to all lysis buffers, as in step 1.1.\nHydroxylamine (HAM) is a powerful reducing agent,  whose cleavage of palmitate from cysteines is required for biotinylation (Figure 1), and the omission of the HAM cleavage serves as a negative control. Split  each sample of beads into two samples, one omitting the HAM cleavage step  (-HAM), and one including the HAM step (+HAM). To normalize for protein  degradation caused by HAM treatment, one should split each sample into thirds, with  1/3 of the beads used for the -HAM control, and the remaining 2/3 used for the  +HAM treatment.",
    "Prepare additional 1.5 ml tubes on ice, labeled as  the -HAM control for each sample. Following step 2.2, gently centrifuge all  samples' beads at 0.5 x g/ 1 min at 4 °C  (centrifuge at this speed, duration, and temperature for all remaining steps  unless otherwise stated), place the tubes on ice, remove the supernatant, and re-suspend  the beads in 600   μl of LB  + 10mM NEM.\nAfter re-suspending the samples' beads in lysis  buffer + NEM 10mM, immediately collect 200   μl of  the sample's lysate-bead slurry, and discharge into that sample's -HAM tube on  ice. Add an additional 300   μl of LB  + 10mM NEM to the -HAM sample, and an additional 100   μl to the +HAM sample for a total of 500   μl in  each sample. Incubate the tubes for 10 min on ice.\nRe-suspend (wash) the -HAM and +HAM samples gently  with 0.5 ml stringent buffer, per sample. Perform this step quickly, as a longer  SDS incubation will result in the removal of bound antibody from the beads.\nGently wash all samples three times in 0.5 ml/sample  of LB pH 7.2, and spin down between washes as in step 3.2b.\nWhile performing step 3.5, prepare a HAM buffer (Table 1). Add appropriate volume of hydroxylamine solution to a new tube, to  achieve a final concentration of 1M in a volume of 0.5 ml LB pH 7.2, per +HAM  sample. Always prepare the HAM buffer fresh for the day of the experiment. Add 0.5 ml/sample  of LB pH 7.2 to all -HAM samples, and 0.5 ml/ sample of HAM buffer to all +HAM  samples.\nNutate all samples for 1 hr at room temperature  (RT). Do not exceed 1 hr.\n4.  Acyl-Biotin Exchange: Biotin-BMCC Labeling",
    "While performing step 3.6, prepare 2 ml of LB pH 6.2  per sample (Table 1), as in step 3.1. Place the LB pH 6.2 on ice until needed. Also  prepare a stock solution of Biotin-BMCC (Table 1) immediately before use. Weigh  out exactly 2.1 mg of Biotin-BMCC, collect in a 1.5 ml tube, and gently dissolve  in 0.5 ml Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by placing on a rocking platform at RT, to  achieve 8mM concentration (do not use a pipette to break up the powder).\nOnce step 3.6 is completed, gently wash the beads once  in pH 6.2 lysis buffer, to remove residual HAM buffer. Remove the supernatant  and place the samples on ice.\nBiotin-BMCC is a maliemide conjugated biotin  molecule that has a high affinity for free thiol groups of cysteines (Figure 1). While  performing step 4.2, prepare 0.5 ml of Biotin-BMCC Buffer (Table 1) per sample,  at working concentration between 0.5 μM to 5 μM. Concentrations in excess of 5 μM  will likely saturate the target protein6, and typically should not be exceeded, however this may differ depending  on the desired target protein. Add 0.5 ml of Biotin-BMCC buffer to each sample,  and nutate for exactly 1 hr at 4 °C. Do  not exceed 1 hr.\n5. Elution of Biotin-conjugated Target Protein and SDS-PAGE\nOnce step 4.3 is completed, gently wash all samples  once in LB pH 6.2. Keep all samples on ice in between washes. Remove 2x SDS  Sample Buffer with no reducing agents (Table 1) from -20 °C storage and slowly thaw on ice.\nGently wash samples three times in LB pH 7.5 +  PMSF/Inhibitors, and keep samples on ice in between washes.",
    "Remove the supernatant of the third wash, leaving  the pelleted beads in a slurry with remaining buffer in the bottom of the tube.  Dip a pipette with a small-diameter tip (a gel loading tip or P2 pipette tip  are sufficient) into the very bottom of the tube through the slurry, and  quickly collect any remaining buffer, being careful not to take up any beads.\nSupplement the 2x SDS Sample Buffer with  DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT) to achieve a final concentration of 5mM. Add 40-50   μl of 2x Sample Buffer + 5mM DTT to each sample. If necessary, vortex the  beads to completely mix with the sample buffer, and immediately centrifuge at  high speed to collect all beads in a pellet, submerged in sample buffer.\nBoil all samples for 10 min at 75-80 °C. Let samples cool to RT for ≥10 min on bench top, and centrifuge at 16,000 x g / 3 min to completely  pellet the beads.\nAdd complete volume of eluted protein (supernatant)  from each sample to a single lane within a polyacrylamide gel suitable for  western blotting, using SDS-PAGE7. Organize all samples so that the -HAM control eluent and +HAM eluent  for a single sample are run immediately adjacent to one another during SDS-PAGE  (Fig. 2). Following SDS-PAGE, transfer to a PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane.\n6. Western Blotting and Detection of Palmitoylation of Target Protein\nOnce step 5.6 is completed, wash the membrane twice  in Tris-buffered Saline (TBS 1x) for 10 min on a rocking platform at RT.",
    "Prepare a Blocking Buffer to block non-specific  labeling by weighing out Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), to achieve 3% weight in a  volume of TBS 1x + Tween-20 0.05% (TBS-T) that is sufficient to fully submerge  the membrane. For streptavidin blotting, always block with BSA and not powdered  milk. Block the membrane for 1 hr at RT on a rocking platform.\nPrepare an antibody solution of TBS-T + 0.3% BSA.  Add Streptavidin-HRP antibody reconstituted at 1 mg/ml in distilled water,  diluted at 1:5,000-1:10,000. Once step 6.2 is completed, wash the membrane once  in TBS-T for 10 min, then incubate the membrane in Streptavidin antibody  solution on a rocking platform for either for 1 hr at RT, or overnight at 4 °C. \nWash the membrane three times in TBS-T for 10 min on a rocking platform. In order to detect the palmitoylation signal, expose  the HRP luminescence using a chemiluminescent substrate kit.\nIn order to normalize palmitoylation levels to the  amount of the protein of interest that was immunoprecipitated, strip the  membrane using western blot stripping buffer for 5-10 min on a rocking  platform at RT. Repeat steps 6.1 - 6.4 using the primary antibody against the  protein of interest that was originally used for the immunoprecipitation.\nQuantify palmitoylation of the protein of interest  using image analysis software, and normalize palmitoylation levels to the  amount of immunoprecipitated protein."
