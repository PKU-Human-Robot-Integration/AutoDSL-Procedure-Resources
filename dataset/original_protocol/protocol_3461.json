    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample isolation\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, we isolate the desired samples from flies and prepare them for mounting. It is recommended that sample isolation and mounting be performed on the same day.\nOocytes of the desired stages can be isolated following the protocol below for mounting and scanning. Drosophila oogenesis is categorized into 14 stages. A D. melanogaster ovary contains ∼16 beads-on-a-string structures, called ovarioles. Each ovariole is a “production line” of oocytes, composed of egg chambers of different stages in order (Bastock and St Johnston, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; McLaughlin and Bratu, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Oocytes at desired stages can be collected by dissecting ovaries and using morphology to identify oocyte stages. Unlike most other species in which egg activation and fertilization occur simultaneously, Drosophila egg activation is uncoupled from fertilization and is triggered during ovulation (Heifetz et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Page and Orr-Weaver, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). Drosophila oocytes can be activated in vivo (and collected after being laid) or in vitro by mechanical pressure or swelling (when mature stage-14 oocytes are incubated in appropriate hypotonic solutions (Horner and Wolfner, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Page and Orr-Weaver, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17])). However, in vitro activation does not completely recapitulate the elemental fluctuations seen in in vivo activation (Hu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nAlthough we have only scanned oocytes and activated eggs, we expect that an analogous protocol can be used for scanning developing embryos. Embryos of a desired stage (Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) can be obtained by collecting laid eggs over a short time-window (30 or 60 min), and then aging them for a controlled period of time. Stages are verified by DAPI-staining a subset of the collected eggs. The embryos may need to be dechorionated manually, in order to allow desiccation.\nSample isolation",
    "For oocytes, dissect 3- to 5-day-old virgin females and isolate oocytes of desired stages in isolation buffer (IB) (Page and Orr-Weaver, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). A detailed protocol for oocyte isolation can be found in (Derrick et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), but briefly: using forceps, ovaries are dissected from the females on a microscope slide, and teased apart to release oocytes. Oocytes of the desired stage, based on morphology, are isolated for further processing. It is recommended to isolate >20 oocytes of each desired stage from >4 different females.\nActivated but unfertilized eggs can be collected as the eggs laid by virgin females, but such females normally produce few eggs each day. To be able to collect many eggs during a short time-window in order to prevent any degradation, mate virgin females overnight (14–16 h) with spermless males. These males are the sons of females homozygous for the tudor mutation (Boswell, 1985[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) that had mated with any genotype of male (we used ORP2 males). On the second day, transfer the female flies to a grape juice agar plate and allow them to lay eggs for ∼5 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C), ideally beginning in the morning. Collect laid eggs by washing them off the plate with egg wash buffer; a small paintbrush can help loosen the eggs. It is recommended to collect >20 activated but unfertilized eggs from >4 different females.",
    "Wash each egg or oocyte twice by grabbing its dorsal appendages (located at the anterior end, see the position of these in the graphical abstract) with forceps and rinsing it in mounting buffer (MB). Wash immature oocytes by pipetting them up and down in MB with a glass Pasteur pipette. This rinses off external salts from the oocytes/eggs without causing mature oocytes to activate and keeps the treatment of oocytes or eggs at different stages consistent.\nCritical: Since immature oocytes are very fragile and mature oocytes can be activated by mechanical pressure (Horner and Wolfner, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), it is important to handle the oocytes gently, to avoid the oocytes experiencing external pressure, or damage and loss of elemental content.\nAccumulate the samples in MB and mount them on the day of collection.\nSample mounting\nTiming: 1 day\nIn this step, we mount the eggs and oocytes that were collected in the previous step onto SiN windows, and wash and air-dry them in preparation for XFM scanning.\nPlace a 5 mm × 5 mm SiN window glued to an aluminum stick (APS custom made, see blueprint in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) with clear nail polish; this is done on the stage of a dissecting microscope. Place a 1 μL drop of MB in the middle of the window. Take extra caution not to contact the window with the pipette tip so as not to break the window.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/348-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Blueprint of aluminum stick used as the holder of silicon nitride (SiN) windows\nSizes are in inches.",
    "Gently transfer an oocyte or egg to the liquid drop with forceps. Grab the oocyte or egg by the dorsal appendages for ease of manipulation and to avoid pressure on the oocyte body. Take extra care not to contact the window with the forceps. Three or four oocytes or eggs can be mounted on the same window. Blot off extra MB with a Kimwipe touched to the edge of the drop. For immature oocytes without dorsal appendages, mount by pipetting ∼5 μL MB containing the oocytes onto the middle of the window and blotting off the excess MB as described. For each stage examined, prepare 3 to 4 windows for a total of 10 to 15 oocytes.\nAir-dry the windows by placing them in a closed petri dish (to avoid dust) at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 30 min. Take a picture of the window under a brightfield microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) to help locate the samples during future XFM scanning.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/348-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative SiN window with three Drosophila oocytes mounted on it\nNote the dorsal appendages, at ~8 o’clock on the upper oocyte, and ~11 o’clock on the lower ones. Scale bar, 500 μm.\nWindows with samples on them are stored in a closed petri dish. The petri dish can be stored at room temperature (20°C–25°C) in a sealed secondary container with desiccant (e.g., cobalt chloride), until XFM scanning.\nXFM data collection and processing\nTiming: 2–3 weeks (depending on sample sizes and numbers)",
    "In this step, the mounted specimens are scanned by XFM (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Such scanning is available at only a few facilities in the world; we performed it at Argonne National Laboratories. To use the Argonne XFM, one must apply for beamtime in advance; applications are available at https://www.aps.anl.gov/[href=https://www.aps.anl.gov/]. Other facilities with XFM capacity will have their own protocols.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/348-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic of 2-ID-E hard X-ray microprobe with its essential components (not to scale)\nThe XRF detector is orthogonal to the incident beam and the sample is rotated 15 degrees toward the detector. At the 2-ID-E beamline, horizontal scans can be done either in fly or step mode, but vertical scans can only be done in step mode; other beamlines may have different scanning modes.\nThe protocol below follows the general methods for XFM scanning (Fahrni, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Paunesku et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), but details given here are specific to the Argonne equipment. It is adaptable to the equipment available at other facilities. The scanning is performed with help from expert staff at the facility.\nThe specimens on SiN windows that are mounted on aluminum sticks (three windows per stick), are fitted into kinematic mounts for Microprobe setup.",
    "Mount the samples in chambers filled with He in order to reduce air scatter, decay of X-ray emitted by samples, and signals from Ar (which partially overlap with potassium signals). Set the X-ray beam to 10.3 KeV by using a 3.3 cm undulator and Si 111 monochromator, trimmed by a 500 μm pinhole, focused with a Fresnel zone plate (320 μm /100 nm, Xradia) to a ∼650 μm spot (Thompson and Vaughan, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Wu et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). The first order is selected by using a 30 μm order-sorting aperture 10 mm upstream of the sample. Scan the sample through the X-ray beam, with a 15° tilt toward the detector, using translation stages with Epics controls (Mooney et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). X-ray fluorescence spectra are collected by Vortex ME 4 (Hitachi) with an xMap DXP (XIA) readout system (Thompson and Vaughan, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). Two ion chambers, upstream of the pinhole and downstream of the sample, measure X-ray absorption by the sample; they are used for normalization.\nInitially, quickly fly-scan all samples selected for XFM analysis with a large step size (5–10 μm2) and short dwell time (5 ms).\nNote: While “fly-scan” seems the perfect term for a Drosophila XFM experiment, it is in fact the standard term for the data collection mode in which the horizontal stage moves the sample continuously through the scan area, at a uniform speed, with fluorescence data collected at specified time intervals (dwell times). This mode is more time-efficient than the more detailed “step scan,” which requires that the stage slow down, stop for data collection, and then resume motion at every pixel position.",
    "Critical: The initial fly-scan is sufficient to detect Zn, K, P, and Fe signals, and allows you to define the area for subsequent more focused detailed scans. It is also necessary to detect any artifacts (sample folds or damage) or contamination by dust or metal particles (which would show up in all elemental maps, or in one elemental map giving extremely high counts). One oocyte/egg scan takes ∼15–20 s.\nHigh-resolution fly-scans of selected oocytes are subsequently performed with a 1 μm step size and a 10 ms dwell time; thus each scan takes about 20 min. Altogether, each sample is scanned twice without significant radiation damage or loss of elements."
