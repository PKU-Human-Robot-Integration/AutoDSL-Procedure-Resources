    "NOTE: All experimental procedures described here were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA, and relevant local authorities in Aachen, Germany.\n1. Retrograde Abdominal Aortic Perfusion and Fixation of Mouse Kidneys\nPrepare solutions the same day or evening before and store in a fridge overnight. Warm solutions to room temperature (RT) before using.\nMake a fresh batch of 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). About 50-100 mL PFA is needed per mouse.\nTo make 1 L of 3% PFA: Weigh 30 g of PFA and add 800 mL of distilled water in the fume hood. Stir and heat to 50-60 °C. Do not heat above 70 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic. Prepare PFA in the fume hood.\nSlowly add several drops of 2N NaOH. Wait a few min until PFA goes into the solution or add a few more drops. Some small chunks will not dissolve.\nRemove the solution from heat. Add 50 mL of 20x PBS. Chill on ice to RT.\nAdjust the pH to 7.3-7.4 with HCl. Add distilled water to 1 L.\nRemove any undissolved particles by filtering 1x PBS and 3% PFA with 0.22 µm filter.\nAdd 1,000 units of Heparin to 1 L of 1x PBS. Transfer 1x PBS containing heparin and 3% PFA in 1x PBS into separate 50 mL plastic syringes.\nNOTE: If available, pressure-controlled pump set at 80-100 mmHg or hydrostatic pressure (drip method, the height of the perfusion solutions: 160-200 cm above animal) can be used for kidney perfusion.\nConnect the PBS, PFA and a blunted 21 G butterfly needle to a three-way stopcock. Make sure there are no air bubbles in the whole system.",
    "Label a 15 mL conical tube and dispense 10 mL of PFA into it.\nDeeply anesthetize a male or female C57BL/6 mouse 12-24 weeks of age using 120 mg/kg bodyweight ketamine and 16 mg/kg bodyweight xylazine. The animal must be checked for complete absence of responsiveness by pinching the reflexes before proceeding to surgery (e.g., toe pinch reflex).\nOnce the animal has reached a surgical plane of anesthesia, place it on its back under the dissecting microscope. Surgically open the abdomen with a midline abdominal incision using an operating scissors and expose the abdominal aorta.\nClamp the abdominal aorta right above the branching to the iliac artery with a curved hemostat. Then clamp the abdominal aorta right below the renal arteries with a micro serrefine. Make a small incision (1 mm) on the abdominal aorta between the two clamps with vannas scissors. Insert the butterfly needle into the incision slowly and be careful not to rip the abdominal aorta open.\nLigate the right renal artery with an 5-0 silk suture and remove the right kidney for other analysis if only one kidney is needed for perfusion and fixation.\nRemove the micro serrefine, transect the portal vein with vannas scissors, and immediately perfuse with 50 mL of PBS containing heparin, then switch and perfuse with 50 mL of 3% PFA.\nNOTE: High perfusion pressure through abdominal aorta is required to open renal tubules for better antibody diffusion through tissue. Perfusion through heart may not open renal tubules.\nCollect the perfused kidney carefully and avoid puncturing or squeezing the tissue.\nRemove the capsule and cut the kidney into 1 mm thick coronal slices. Use a slicer matrix (Table of Materials) to standardize slice thickness.\nNOTE: Alternatively, consider using a vibratome.",
    "Immerse the kidney slices with the prepared PFA in the labeled 15 mL conical tube.\nDispense 10 mL of PFA to another labeled 15 mL conical tube. Flush the three-way stopcock and butterfly needle with PBS before moving to the next mouse.\nCarry out post-fixation overnight at RT protected from light.\n2. Tissue Preparation and Immunostaining\nAfter post-fixation, wash the kidney slice twice with 1x wash buffer (Table of Materials) for 1 h on a horizontal rocker at RT.\nPerform antigen retrieval. Heat up 300 mL of 1x antigen unmasking solution (Table of Materials) in a 500 mL beaker to 92-98 °C. Enclose the slice in embedding cassette permeable to the heated buffer with stirring for 1 h at 92-98 °C. Remove the beaker from heat and leave it to cool to RT.\nNOTE: Some vendors test their antibodies for immunohistochemistry application and will include a suggested antigen retrieval method in the datasheet. Therefore, some epitopes may require a more basic buffer (e.g., pH 9).\nTransfer the slice into 10 mL of 1x wash buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100 and rock overnight at RT. Wash the slices 2x with 10 mL of fresh 1x wash buffer for 1 h the next day.\nDilute the primary antibody in 500 µL of normal antibody diluent (Table of Materials). Begin with a concentration of ­­­1:50-1:100. Gently rock the kidney slice in diluted primary antibody for 4 d at 37 °C.\nNOTE: Since each antibody has unique properties, temperature during antibody incubation and dilutions of antibody need to be optimized for individual probes. For secondary antibody-only controls, incubate kidney tissue in diluent without primary antibody. Instead of commercial antibody diluent, 1x PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.01% sodium azide can be used.",
    "Wash the kidney slice in 10 mL of 1x wash buffer overnight at RT with one change of wash buffer after 8 h.\nDilute the secondary antibodies (e.g., 1:100 for Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies) in 500 µL of normal antibody diluent. Incubate the kidney slices in diluted secondary antibody for 4 days at 37 °C. From this step onwards, protect the kidney slices from light.\nWash the kidney slices in 10 mL of 1x wash buffer overnight at RT with one change of wash buffer after 8 h.\n3. Tissue Clearing\nTransfer kidney slice to 5 mL of high grade 100% ethanol (Table of Materials) for 2 h at RT with gentle rocking (with one change to fresh ethanol after 1 h). This step is for tissue dehydration.\nNOTE: High grade ethanol is required to achieve a high tissue translucency in the next step. Methanol or tetrahydrofuran are alternative dehydration reagents with high delipidation potential.\nImmerse kidney slice in 2 mL of ECi (Table of Materials) with gentle rocking at RT (with one change to fresh ECi after 2 h) overnight.\nNOTE: The freezing/melting point of ECi is 6-8 °C. Therefore, do not store samples in the fridge. Conduct immersion in a properly ventilated fume hood and avoid direct contact with clothes and skin (ECi is a non-toxic Food and Drug Administration-approved compound but has a strong odor). Use regular Eppendorf tubes or glass vessels (no polystyrene vessels).\nTissue translucency can be achieved after ECi immersion and when the kidney slices are ready for imaging.\n4. ConfocalImaging and Image Analysis\nNOTE: For imaging, other microscopy techniques can be used as long as the refractive index matching solution is compatible with the objective lens. This protocol uses an inverted confocal microscope.",
    "Add 600-1,000 μL of ECi into the glass bottom dish (Table of Materials).\nNOTE: Avoid use of regular cell culture dishes, because ECi is an organic solvent that will dissolve the plastic dishes. Similarly, ECi might attack plastic parts/insulation rings on objective lenses. Refer to the appropriate reports for an overview of compatible imaging dishes30 and self-made 3-D printed chambers28.\nTransfer the translucent kidney slice into the dish. Place a round coverslip on the kidney slice to apply light pressure towards the glass bottom. Seal the dish with paraffin film (Table of Materials) to avoid leakage of ECi.\nNOTE: Whole organs or several millimeter-thick tissue slices may require a border (dental cement or silicone elastomer; see Table of Materials) around the tissue to make an ECi-pool for the sample.\nPlace the dish onto the microscope imaging platform.\nTake several z-stacks and perform stitching. Start with a z-step size of 5 μm.\nNOTE: Consider using long working distance (>5 mm) and high numerical aperture (>0.9) objectives for imaging of very thick tissue slices or organs. After imaging, transfer the tissue back to ethanol and store in wash buffer or PBS with 0.02% sodium azide.\nAnalyze the image using 3-D rendering with software (Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
