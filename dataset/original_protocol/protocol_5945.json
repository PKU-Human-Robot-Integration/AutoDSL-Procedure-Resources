    "All experiments were conducted during dark phase, under dim light illumination.Experimental setupAnimals: Naïve C57Bl/6Js were used, and as wild-type controls for the DAT-Cnr2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. The generation and breeding of the cKO mice was previously reported (Liu et al., 2017).Experimental space should be quiet and dimly lit, under controlled humidity and temperature.All the cages should be placed on a rack designated for this experiment. The rack should be stable to avoid movement and to prevent leakage. The experimenter should be careful when removing the bottles to minimize the amount of leakage. Leakage should be avoided to reduce undesired variability.The experimental area should be clean, and all the measurements should be conducted at the same time of the day.One of the cages will be the “control cage”. This cage will have everything described above except a mouse.All cages should be labeled with the information for the specific experiment, such as the mouse’s strain, age, and gender. Food should always be kept on the right side for consistency.Setting up 2-bottle choice testFill all the bottles with 150 ml of water and put on the sipper tap. Note: Make sure there are no water leaks by inverting the bottles. Label each bottle with the number of the subject mouse (1, 2, 3…) in permanent marker. Label the cages with the same number.Place the 2 bottles onto the wire lid (Figure 2), with minimal shaking to avoid dripping. Both bottles should be placed on one side of the divided wire rack, leaving the other side for food. Put food pellets on the other side of the wire lid. Note: Make sure that the food is always on the right side, to be consistent.",
    "Mice were adapted to the testing room, with the same conditions as in the colony room (22 ± 2 °C; humidity: 55 ± 5%; 12 h dim/artificial light/12 h dark cycle: light off at 7 PM). Habituation to the 2-bottlePlace a single mouse in the proper mouse caging (see Equipment) under controlled conditions (see Materials and Reagents).Isolate the subjects into individual cages and give them two bottles filled with 150 ml water. Allow mice to acclimate for at least 4 days under these conditions.Setting up 2 bottle choice for alcohol preferenceRemove the bottles and clean them.Mix water with 100% alcohol to 16%.For each mouse, fill one bottle with 150 ml of water and another bottle with alcohol solution. Put the sipper cap on the bottle. Note: Make sure there are no water leaks by inverting the bottles. Label each bottle with the assigned number of the mouse, and water or alcohol in permanent marker (e.g., 1 H2O/1 EtOH).Record weight with cap on the bottle and write down the value on a record sheet.Evaluation of alcohol preferencePlace the 2 bottles onto the wire lid, with minimal shaking to avoid dripping. Both bottles should be placed on one side of the divided wire rack, leaving the other side for food. Put food pellets on the other side of the wire lid. Note: Make sure that the food is always on the right side, to be consistent. Assess water and alcohol solution consumption daily for 5 days. Record weight. Monitor for any problems with liquid flow or spillage, e.g., wet bedding below the sipper tube. Switch positions (left vs. right) of bottles daily.The “control cage” has just two bottles of water without a mouse.",
    "These bottles are weighed to determine the amount of spillage when bottles are inverted, and to later correct the data of the other groups.Acute stress-induced alcohol preference (5 days)Set up 2 bottle choices for alcohol preference (described above).After removing the bottles for daily weighing on the first day, mice are randomly assigned to be in the experimental or control group. Label the cages with “control” or “experimental” (above where the mouse’s number is) and place them by group on the shelf. The experimental group of mice are restrained in a 50 ml conical tube for an hour. After that, they are released and the bottles for both groups (control and experimental) and placed in the cages again.Repeat these steps for 5 consecutive days. The bottles are weighed each day, and the mice are weighed before and after each phase.The general timeline of the alcohol preference is depicted from Procedures D-F over the 5-day period. Chronic mild stress (CMS) induced alcohol consumption (from 4-7 weeks) (Table 1)Set up separate groups of the wild-type and selected cKO mice (n = 6 per group) for experimental and control groups in separate rooms. All animals are housed individually, except for the non-stressed control groups.For the CMS regime, mice are subjected to various stressors according to a semi-random schedule Table 1 for 4-7 weeks as planned.The stress regime for each week consisted of food deprivation for 12 h, water deprivation for 12 h, damp bedding for 12 h, overnight stroboscopic illumination, tail suspension for 10 min, tube restrain for 30 min, as described above, loud music overnight, wire mesh to replace bedding 12 h, 30 min introduction of an intruder mouse to the cage and lights off or on. These stressors were paired morning or overnight.",
    "All non-CMS groups in the separate room were given food and water at all times.Conditioned place preference (CPP)Alcohol CPP training and testing are conducted using an infra-red photobeam detector open field apparatus (ENV-510) from Med Associates (St. Albans, VT, USA).Alcohol CPP training and testing are conducted using an infra-red photobeam detector open field apparatus (ENV-510) from Med Associates (St. Albans, VT, USA) equipped with the two-compartment place preference inserts (ENV-512), as shown in Figure 1D. The floor of compartment-1 has parallel rods (3-mm radius, 8 mm center to center spacing) with black cardboard paper covering the outside. Compartment-2 has a stainless steel wire mesh (6 x 6) floor with white cardboard paper covering the outside of the walls. Each compartment is 13 cm (width) x 15 cm (depth).Perform all conditioning sessions and preference tests in each group in three phases (Figure 3) (pre-conditioning, conditioning and post-conditioning phases).During the post-conditioning phase on the test day, mice are allowed to explore both compartments for 15 min.The CPP score is defined as the time spent in the alcohol paired compartment minus the time spent in the saline-paired compartment during the CPP test.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181014/20181014203845_0176.jpgFigure 2.

Graphical presentation of the CPP paradigm used. All conditioning sessions and preference tests were performed at the same time daily. Animals were allowed to habituate in the CPP apparatus for 45 min before the conditioning phase.Table 1.
