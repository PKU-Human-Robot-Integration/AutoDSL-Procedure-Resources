    "Images acquisitionThe macro described below can work with any type of confocal images whether taken with a laser scanning confocal microscope or with a spinning disk confocal microscope. You should therefore define acquisition parameter according to your microscope set-up. Note that for quantitative imaging, pictures should be taken with detector settings optimized for low background and no pixel saturation (Simon et al., 2016). For comparison purposes, we recommend using similar confocal settings for all images. Exposure time must be defined by taking into account compartments movement during acquisition. Too long exposure might lead to abnormal shape or multiple counts of the same intracellular particles.As an example, using the spinning disk microscope described in the equipment section above, we typically use the following settings: image acquisition time 200 msec, laser power 30%, EM gain 100 and image size 1024 x 1024 pixels. Note: The settings used might vary greatly depending on the microscope set-up and the strength of the marker line.

Procedure to install the Sice Spotdetector Macro and related Plugins Setting up parameters for single image analysisThe purpose of single image analysis (Procedure C) is to find the best parameters possible to segment your image correctly (i.e., best parameters to find all [or most] of the compartments in the image with as little false positive as possible) and then use these parameters in batch mode (Procedure D). Every marker lines have different signal strength, particle size and signal-to-noise ratio.",
    "It is impossible to predict which will be the best parameters to use for a specific marker line. Therefore, these parameters have to be determined empirically for each marker lines. The procedure in C allows testing a range of parameters to confront the segmentation results with your input image (step C10). Mostly, the use of these parameters are empirical and we advise you to explore different ones in order to find the best setting for your image (below, we provide some numbers that we find often work well for counting endosome numbers in Arabidopsis root). However some of these parameters are directly dependent on the type of particles you want to analyze, notably the size and circularity. Particle size can be estimated using the optional step C3, but you can also try different size parameters empirically as well and by-pass step C3.Open a confocal image with ImageJ (or Fiji) software in which you want to quantify the number of intracellular compartments or template pictures (see Note 2). It is possible to use a projected 3D-stack. However, we do not recommend using projections that might yield artifacts and/or mask the presence of some particles and we recommend instead quantifying all the images in the Z-stack using the batch mode (see Procedure D). If you want to use scaled images, ‘Set Scale’ in the ‘Analyze Tab’ according to your microscope set-up, otherwise proceeds directly to step C3.Estimate particle size with ImageJ (Optional STEP, Video 2). Use straight-line tool to draw a line through several compartments. Then, use the plot profile tool (Analyze > Plot profile) and measure the size of the structures within the profile by using again the straight-line tool. Measure several compartments small and big ones approximately at the base of the peaks (Figure 1).",
    "It will help you to determine maximum size, minimum size and sigma parameters, which will be useful for detection step (see below step C8). As an example, see Figure 2, which shows the typical size of various compartments obtained with the microscope set-up described above (see Equipment section). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170224/20170224012431_9093.jpgFigure 1.

Late endosomes (W7) fuse into the so-called ‘Wortmannin compartment’ following treatment with the PI3Kinase/PI4Kinase inhibitor Wortmannin (Wm, 30 µM for 60 min) (Jaillais et al., 2006; Simon et al., 2014; Simon et al., 2016). F. BFA compartments. Endosomes labeled by the endocytic tracer FM4-64 aggregates into the so-called ‘BFA compartment’ following treatment with the fungal toxin BrefeldinA (BFA, 50 µM for 60 min) (Geldner et al., 2003; Geldner et al., 2009).

Procedure to find the best parameters to segment intracellular particles with the SiCE spot detector macro Uncheck Batch mode to start single image analysis.Select if you want to use scaled images or un-scaled images, by checking/unchecking the ‘scaled image’ box. Scaled image will provide results expressed in number of spots/µm2, while un-scalded images will provide result expressed in number of spot/pixel2Uncheck Automatic ROI if you want to manually draw region of interest (Note 3).Select parameters (Figure 2)First three parameters directly arise from step C3. Min Particle Size, Max Particle Size and Circularity will be used in the Built-in Macro Function Analyse Particles (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-30.html[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-30.html]). Particles with size outside the range defined are ignored. Values are expressed either in square µm or square pixels. Circularity depends on the shape of the compartments and range from 0 (infinitely elongated polygon) to 1 (perfect circle). Classically, intracellular compartments in Arabidopsis roots, such as endosomes, can be detected using 0.5-5 µm2 and 0.5-1 circularity (but other parameters may be used to quantify more elongated particles, or bigger particles such as BFA compartments).In confocal images Intracellular compartments of interest will appear as more or less round shaped objects with higher fluorescent signal in the center. Image convolution by a Gaussian kernel is generally sufficient for segmenting them. Sigma parameter corresponds to standard deviation of the distribution used in the Gaussian filtering method (Lowe, 2004). Adjusting Sigma will depend on the background within cells and your object size and has to be determined empirically. The Gaussian filtering that will be applied to your image can be chosen from Difference of Gaussian ‘DoG’ or Laplacian of Gaussian.",
    "Classically, Laplacian of Gaussian filtering gives the sharpest boundaries of the objects allowing size measurement, while DoG filtering will be more efficient in findings structures of different sizes or in a higher background.Auto-threshold corresponds to the method/algorithm that will be applied to your filtered image (Triangle, Otsu and Huang) (see more details about this step at the following address http://imagej.net/Auto_Threshold[href=http://imagej.net/Auto_Threshold]). Again, you need to try these different methods to find the best one empirically.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170224/20170224012610_8465.jpgFigure 3. Snapshot from ImageJ program showing selection of parameters step. A. FIJI main toolbar; B. Test image window; C. Select Parameters selection windows of the SICE spot detector.Once you have chosen all your parameters, click ‘OK’ to proceed with the analysis.If you chose manual mode type OK and define a Region of Interest (ROI). Compartments within the defined area will be segmented according to the parameters, methods and modes chosen previously in step C8.If you chose automatic ROI (step C7), the macro will automatically define the portion of the image that corresponds to the root tissue with the highest signal (see red line in Figure 4) (see Note 3) and will discard the rest of the image for subsequent analyses. A merge image between segmented compartments boundaries and original fluorescent image will be displayed to evaluate the efficiency of the process (Figure 4); i.e., it will help you to evaluate if the parameters you used are the best to find the intracellular compartments of interest. ROI will be displayed on the original image as a red surrounded region. By clicking ‘OK’ you can return to step C8 to modify parameters and make new analyses. In manual ROI selection mode, you will be able to test a new set of parameters on the same manually defined ROI (ROI defined previously in step C9a).",
    "You will also have the option to define a new ROI. Automatic ROI allows you to switch from automatic to manual ROI selection of vice-versa.Reiterate steps C6-C10 until you find the best parameters to segment intracellular compartments in your image and then proceed to step C12.Uncheck the ‘unhappy’ box to display a ‘Summary’ table with ‘Picture name’, ‘Cell Area’, ‘Spot number’ and parameters used. Once you determined optimum parameters for your data set, you can relaunch the macro for batch mode analysis (see Procedure D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170224/20170224012634_3234.jpgFigure 4.
