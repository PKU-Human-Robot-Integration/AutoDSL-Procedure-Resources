    "1. Preparation of MALDI matrix\nPrepare 10 mg/mL MALDI-grade, and/or recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) in MS-grade solvents: 50% acetonitrile (ACN), 47.5% water (H2O), 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Example: 100 µL solution = 50 µL ACN + 47.5 µL H2O + 2.5 µL TFA + 1 mg CHCA\n\t\nPrepare at least 1 µL of matrix solution per MALDI plate spot and vortex or sonicate until in solution (approximately 5 min sonication or no visible solids).\n\t\tCAUTION: TFA is a strong acid that should be handled in a chemical fume hood while wearing proper personal protective equipment, as it can damage skin, eyes, and airways with contact or inhalation.\n\t\tNOTE: CHCA is hygroscopic and light-sensitive and should be stored in amber vials in a desiccator. There are many MALDI matrix options available. CHCA is most common for protein profiling of bacteria, but also works for specialized metabolite analysis. Matrix selection depends on individual user/experiment needs.\n2. Preparation of MALDI target plates\nNOTE: See Sauer et al.7, for more details.\nRinse MALDI plate with methanol (HPLC-grade or higher) and wipe dry with soft paper wipes. Do not use abrasive brushes when cleaning target plates, as this can permanently damage the surface of the target plate.\nAssign protein and specialized metabolite calibrant spots. Organize calibration spots evenly across the sample population, to account for MALDI-plate-irregularities and instrument drift over time. Assign an appropriate number of media/matrix-blank spots for the study; these spots will contain only media and matrix, or only matrix.\nUsing a sterile toothpick, transfer a small portion of a bacterial colony to the appropriate spot on the MALDI plate. Spread the bacterial colony evenly over the spot. The spot should appear as flat as possible.",
    "NOTE: It will be easier to flatten bacterial colonies that are more mucoid/amorphous. For more rigid/solid colonies, avoid leaving visible clusters of cell mass on the MALDI spot (Figure 1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: MALDI-target plate showing two different isolates before adding formic acid and MALDI matrix (top 3 spots - Bacillus sp.; bottom 3 spots - Streptomyces sp.). For both, column 3 represents excess sample; column 2 represents the appropriate amount of sample; column 1 represents insufficient sample for MALDI analysis.

Allow acid to air dry completely in a chemical fume hood (approximately 5 min).\n\tCAUTION: Formic acid is a caustic chemical and should be handled in chemical fume hoods. It can damage airways if inhaled.\nAdd 1 µL of the prepared MALDI matrix solution to each sample spot, as well as to the matrix/media control spots. Allow matrix solution to air dry completely (approximately 5 min).\n\tNOTE: It is possible to store the plate in a desiccator, in the dark, until it can be analyzed on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Allowable storage times may vary depending on sample stability.\nAdd 0.5–1.0 µL calibrant to the assigned calibration spots, followed by 1 µL MALDI matrix solution. Pipette the resulting solution up and down to mix. Allow all spots to air dry completely prior to introduction into the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.\n\tNOTE: The protein and specialized metabolite calibrants should be added within 30 min of MALDI analysis, as both are susceptible to degradation.\n3. Data acquisition",
    "NOTE: The general parameters for data acquisition are listed in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nParameter,Protein,Specialized Metabolite\nMass Start (Da),1920,60\nMass End (Da),21000,2700\nMass Deflection (Da),1900,50\nShots,500,1000\nFrequency (Hz),2000,2000\nLaser Size,Large,Medium\nMaxStdDev (ppm),300,30\nTable 1.\nFollowing the protocols specific to the instrument being used, set up both protein and specialized metabolite calibrations.\nTest a few separate target spots to determine the optimal laser power and detector gain to use when acquiring spectra (this will vary day-to-day and by instrument).\n\tNOTE: Figure 2A and Figure 3A show optimal spectra, while Figure 2D and Figure 3D are examples of poor-quality spectra.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Example protein spectra displaying the effect of modifying laser power and detector gain. Spectra quality is best in panel A, and decreases until insufficient spectra quality in panels C and D. While the spectrum in panel B may result in useable peaks, panel A displays optimal data.

Cleaning the MALDI target plate (adapted from Sauer et al.7)\nRemove the MALDI target plate from its holder and rinse with acetone.\nWash with a non-abrasive liquid soap to remove trace proteins and lipids, and soft paper wipes/soft-bristled toothbrush.\nRinse with de-ionized water for approximately 2 min to completely remove soap.",
    "Sonicate the target plate in water (HPLC grade or higher) for 5 min.\nRinse the target plate with water (HPLC grade or higher).\nRinse the target plate with methanol (HPLC grade or higher).\n5. Installing the IDBac Software\nDownload the IDBac software.\n\tNOTE: Permanent, versioned backups are also available for download (see the Table of Materials).\nDouble-click the downloaded “Install_IDBac.exe” to initiate the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.\n6. Starting with Raw Data\nNOTE: Detailed explanations and instructions of each data processing step are embedded within IDBac, however the main analyses and interactive inputs are described below.\nDouble-click the IDBac desktop shortcut to launch IDBac. IDBac will open on the Introduction tab by default.\nUse the Check for Updates button to ensure that the most current version of IDBac is being used (requires internet access). If a newer version is available, IDBac will automatically download and install the update, after which IDBac will request to be restarted.\nClick on the Starting with Raw Data tab and choose from the menu the type of data to be used with IDBac; continue by following the in-app instructions.\nWhen setting-up the conversion and processing of data files, input a descriptive name for the experiment where prompted (see Figure 4). Experiments will later be displayed alphabetically, so a helpful strategy is to start experiment names with a group-attribute (e.g., “bacillus-trials_experiment-1”; “bacillus-trials_experiment-2”).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: IDBac data conversion and preprocessing step. IDBac converts raw spectra into the open mzML format and stores mzML, peak lists, and sample information in a database for each experiment.

Input information into the auto-populated spreadsheet and press Save (Figure 6). This option allows the user to color-code data during analyses.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig6.jpg\nFigure 6: Input sample information. Within the “Work with Previous Experiments” page users can input information about samples such as taxonomic identity, collection location, isolation conditions, etc. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig6large.jpg]\n(Optional) Transfer all, or a subset of samples to a new or another experiment by clicking Transfer samples from previous experiments to new/other experiments and following the provided instructions (Figure 7).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig7.jpg\nFigure 7: Transfer data. The “Work with Previous Experiments” page contains the option to transfer data between existing experiments and to new experiments. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig7large.jpg]\nWhen ready to begin analysis, ensure the experiment to work with is selected. Select either Protein Data Analysis or Small Molecule Data Analysis.\n8. Setting up protein data analysis and creating mirror plots\nIf analyzing protein data, first navigate to the Protein Data Analysis page. Choose peak-picking settings and evaluate protein spectra of samples via the displayed mirror plots (Figure 8).\n\tNOTE: In the mirror plots, a red peak signifies the presence of that peak only in the top spectrum, while blue peaks represent those occurring in both spectra.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig8.jpg",
    "Figure 8: Choose how peaks are retained for analysis. After selecting an experiment to analyze, visiting the “Protein Data Analysis” page and subsequently opening the “Choose how Peaks are Retained for Analysis” menu allows users to choose settings like signal-to-noise ratio for retaining peaks. The displayed mirror plot (or dendrogram) will automatically update to reflect the chosen settings. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig8large.jpg]\nAdjust the percentage of replicates in which a peak must be present in order for it to be included for analyses (e.g., if the threshold is set to 70% and a peak occurs in at least 7 out of 10 replicates, it will be included).\nUsing the mirror plots as visual guidance, adjust the signal to noise cutoff that retains the most “genuine” peaks and the least noise, noting that more replicates and a higher “percentage peak presence” value will allow selection of a lower signal to noise cutoff.\nSpecify the lower and upper m/z cutoffs, dictating the range of mass values within each spectrum to be used in further analyses by IDBac.\n9. Clustering samples using protein data\nWithin the Protein Data Analysis page, select the Dendrogram tab. This allows for grouping samples into a dendrogram according to user-selected distance measures and clustering algorithms.\nClick Select Samples on the menu and follow the instructions to select samples to include in the analyses. Only samples that contain protein spectra will be displayed within the Available Samples box (Figure 9).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig9.jpg\nFigure 9: Select samples from the chosen experiment to include within the displayed dendrogram. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig9large.jpg]\nUse the default values or, under Choose Clustering Settings, select the desired Distance and Clustering algorithms to be applied to the generation of the dendrogram.",
    "Select Presence/Absence as input. Alternatively, if confident about the peak heights of the samples (e.g., after performing a study to assess variability of peak intensity), select Intensities as input.\n\tNOTE: At the time of publication, IDBac provides flexibility in settings for clustering, relying on users to choose the appropriate combinations. If unfamiliar with these options, it is suggested to pair either A: “cosine” distance, and “average (UPGMA)” clustering; or B: “Euclidean” distance, and “Ward.D2” clustering.\nTo display bootstrap values on the dendrogram, enter a number between 2 and 1000 under Bootstraps.\nWhen reporting results, copy the text within the Suggestions for Reporting Protein Analysis paragraph. This provides the user-defined settings that generated the specific dendrogram.\n10. Customizing the protein dendrogram\nTo begin customizing the dendrogram, open the Adjust the dendrogram menu (Figure 10).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig10.jpg\nFigure 10: Adjust the dendrogram. IDBac provides a few options for modifying how the dendrogram looks, these may be found within the menu “Adjust the Dendrogram”. This includes coloring branches and labels by k-means, or by “cutting” the dendrogram at a user-provided height. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig10large.jpg]\nTo color the dendrogram’s lines and/or labels select the appropriate button: Click to modify lines or Click to modify labels and select the desired options.\nTo plot information from the spreadsheet next to the dendrogram (see step 7.2), select the button Incorporate info about samples. This will open a panel where a category (column in the spreadsheet) will self-populate based on the entered values (Figure 11).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig11v2.jpg",
    "Figure 11: Incorporate info about samples. Within the “Adjust the Dendrogram” menu is the option “Incorporate info about samples”. Selecting this will allow plotting information about samples next to the dendrogram. Sample information is input within the “Work with Previous Experiments” page. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig11v2large.jpg]\n11. Insert samples from a separate experiment into the dendrogram\nTo insert samples from another experiment, select the menu button Insert Samples from Another Experiment. Follow the directions in the newly-opened panel (Figure 12).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig12v2.jpg\nFigure 12: Insert Samples from Another Experiment menu.

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig12v2large.jpg]\n12. Analyzing specialized metabolite data and metabolite association networks (MANs)\nProceed to the Metabolite Association Network (Small-Molecule) page. This page allows for data visualization by principle components analysis (PCA) and MANs, which use bipartite networks to display the correlation of small molecule m/z values with samples.\nIf a protein dendrogram was created (section 9), it will be displayed on this page as well. Click-and-drag on the dendrogram to highlight select samples of interest to be analyzed. If no samples are highlighted or no protein dendrogram was created, a MAN of a either a random subset or all samples will appear, respectfully (Figure 13).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59219/59219fig13v2.jpg\nFigure 13: Small Molecule Data Analysis” page. If a dendrogram was created from protein spectra, it will be displayed within the “Small Molecule Data Analysis” page. This page will also display Metabolite Associate Networks (MANs) and Principle Components Analysis (PCA) for small molecule data.

    "To subtract a matrix/media blank in the MAN, open the menu Select a Sample to Subtract and choose the appropriate sample to use as a blank.\nOpen the menu Show/Hide MAN Settings to select the desired values for percentage of peak presence in replicates, signal to noise, and upper and lower mass cutoffs, as was done for protein spectra in Section 9. Use the small molecule mirror plots to guide the selection of these settings.\nSelect “Download Current Network Data” to save the data of the MAN that is currently displayed. These data can be used in network analysis software other than IDBac.\nFor reporting results, copy the text within the Suggestions for Reporting MAN Analysis paragraph. This provides the user-defined settings used to generate the created MAN.\n13. Sharing data\nEach IDBac “experiment” is saved as a single SQLite database. It contains the converted mzML raw spectra, detected peaks, and all user-input information about samples. Therefore, to share an IDBac experiment simply share the SQlite file that has the same name as the experiment (the file location is displayed on the Working with Previous Experiments page)."
