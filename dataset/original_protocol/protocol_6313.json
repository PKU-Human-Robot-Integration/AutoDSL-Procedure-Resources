    "Flies collectionDrosophila flies are reared at 22 °C on standard medium. To prevent gender differences, collect only female flies at relevant age. For collecting young adults, we used 3-10 days old flies that were transferred to 29 °C for two days for activating the GAL4/Gal80 system and UAS-RNAi for gene knockdown. For more details regarding the GAL4/GAL80 system, see Salmeron et al. (1990) and Brand and Perrimon (1993). 5mC methylation assayDissect guts in watch glasses squares filled with cold Schneider medium. Transfer dissected guts to an Eppendorf tube containing 0.5 ml Schneider medium. Eppendorf tubes with dissected guts are kept on ice. Collect 8-10 guts per Eppendorf tube. For detailed gut dissection, see an excellent midgut protocol (Nawrot-Esposito et al., 2017). Remove Schneider media and add 1 ml cold DPBS to wash dissected guts (replace media only without incubation time).Fix: Replace DPBS with 1 ml of freshly made \"Fix-I solution\" (Recipe 1), this will form two phases of liquids: the upper phase is Heptane and lower phase is the formaldehyde/DPBS solution at the bottom (See Figure 3 “Fix”). Rotate for 20 min on an orbital shaker at RT.Note: Over-crosslinking can cause reduced diffusion and accessibility of the enzyme to the nuclei. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191114/20191114182739_5823.jpg Figure 3. Typical Eppendorf tube after formation of the two phasesGently remove all the liquid solutions (the 2 phases) leaving only the dissected tissue at the bottom. Be sure to remove all heptane, also from the cap.Wash guts three times with 1 ml DPBS, in each wash rotate the guts for 15 min at RT. Permeabilization: Permeabilize the tissue by incubating with 500 µl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 1h on an orbital shaker in Eppendorf tubes, at RT (we recommend evaluating different permeabilization conditions [e.g., 1 h, 2 h and triton concentrations (0.5%, 0.",
    "6%, 0.7%)]).Gently remove Triton solution, and wash for three times with DPBS, in each wash rotate the guts for 15 min at RT.Block in 1 ml \"PAT solution\" (Recipe 2) overnight at 4 °C on an orbital shaker.Wash twice with freshly prepared 250 μl of \"Pre-reaction Buffer \"(Recipe 3), 15 min each wash. Methylation reaction: Gently remove \"Pre-Reaction Buffer” and resuspend in 50 µl of M. SssI reaction buffer (Recipe 4) and incubate for 1 h at 25 °C, on an orbital shaker.Important: Titer the reaction conditions time (e.g., 1 h, 5 h, 24 h) and enzyme amount (25 U, 50 U) for optimal results. Termination: Add 1 ml of 2 N HCl and rotate on an orbital shaker at room temperature for 30 min. This step stops the M. SssI reaction and denatures the DNA.Remove HCl solution and neutralize with 0.5 ml of freshly prepared 100 mM Borax (dissolved in water) and rotate on an orbital shaker for 5 min at RT.Remove Borax and wash twice with 1 ml DPBS, rotate the guts for 15 min at RT each wash.Fix with freshly prepared \"Fix-II solution\" (Recipe 5) and rotate for 10 min. Remove Fix-II and wash twice with 1 ml \"PBX solution\" (Recipe 6), rotate the guts for 15 min at RT each wash. Note: Evaluate different time points (10, 15, 20 min) as over-crosslinking could affect antibody penetration. Remove PBX and block with 1 ml \"PAT solution\" (Recipe 2), for 30 min rotating at RT. Remove blocking solution and add diluted anti-5mC primary antibody in \"PAT solution\" (Recipe 2), to a concentration of 1 μg/ml (1:1,000). Incubate overnight at 4 °C on an Orbital shaker. Remove primary antibody and wash three times with \"PBT solution\" (Recipe 7), rotating for 15 min each wash at RT.",
    "Remove PBT and incubate in diluted Secondary Fluorescent anti-mouse (1:1,000) together with DAPI (1:1,000) (for DNA staining) in \"PAT solution\" (Recipe 2), cover the samples with aluminum foil or in a light protected box, and rotate on orbital shaker for 1 h in the dark. Remove Secondary antibody and DAPI solution and wash three times with \"PBT solution\" (recipe 7), 15 min each wash while rotating in light protected environment (box or aluminum foil) at RT.Wash twice with 1 ml DPBS, rotate the guts for 15 min at RT each wash.Mount in a Fluoromount-G (25 ml) on slide and keep at 4 °C until confocal microscopic analysis.Visualize under a confocal microscope, signal intensity in cells can be quantified. For quantification we suggest counting several hundreds of cells derived from different biological repeats, and in each scoring 5mC positive polyploid cells."
