    "Day 1Start 5 ml overnight (16-18 h) culture of E. coli isolate UTI89 (or other ExPEC strain) in LB at 37 °C with aeration.Seed RAW 264.7 cells into 24 well trays (Note 4) at a density of 1 x 105 cells/well and allow to adhere and grow to confluence for 36-42 h prior to infection. For general maintenance, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages are routinely grown in DMEM (HG) + 10% FBS and sub-cultured 1:4 approximately every 3 days using a cell scraper to detach adherent cells for sub-culture.Day 2Back-dilute bacterial culture 1:100 into 10 ml fresh LB media, and grow statically at 37 °C for 18-24 h to induce expression of type 1 pili adherence factor. This can be accomplished in an Erlenmeyer flask or sterile petri dish.To stimulate NO expression and the production of cytokines, pre-treat several wells of RAW 264.7 cells with 1 ng/ml IFNγ for 16-18 h (overnight) prior to infection (see diagram of 24-well tray below).Day 31 mM L-arginine is included in the media of a second group of RAW 264.7 cells for 1 h to pre-load cells for nitric oxide production upon stimulation with E. coli infection. L-arginine is a precursor to NO.A third group of RAW 264.7 cells is pre-treated with 1 mM of the iNOS-specific inhibitor L-NAME for 1 h prior to infection to inhibit NO production. L-arginine and L-NAME are subsequently included in the media for the duration of the experiments.Finally, a fourth group of RAW 264.7 cells is left untreated (naive) to serve as an un-stimulated control.Infect cells with E. coli by adding 10 μl of an OD600= 0.8 bacterial suspension (~1 x 107 colony forming units (CFU)7 or multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10) in PBS to confluent cell monolayers (~1 x 106 cells/well) for all 4 treatment groups.",
    "Centrifuge plates in a swinging bucket clinical centrifuge with microtray adaptors at low speed to bring bacteria in contact with the cell monolayer (5 min at 1,000 rpm) and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Determine initial 1 h adherence/invasion for the various treatment groups by following steps m through p). This number will be used to normalize CFU/well at 24 h post-infection to account for any difference in initial adherence/invasion among the various treatment groups or bacterial strains (Note 6).For the remainder of the treatment groups, wash infected monolayers 3 times with 0.5 ml PBS (avoid touching the monolayer with pipette tips or directly applying the wash onto the monolayer as this may disturb the integrity of the monolayer. This step is to remove the majority of extracellular bacteria).Incubate for the remainder of the 24 h experiment using a step-down gentamicin protocol (100 μg/ml gentamicin in DMEM HG + 10% FBS for 2 h then exchange for media with 50 μg/ml gentamicin for 21 h) (Note 7).Day 4Wash cells 3 times with 0.5 ml PBS. Remove last wash and add 1 ml PBS + 0.1% Triton-X. Pipet vigorously to lyse cells. Minor foaming is acceptable.Determine intracellular bacterial burden by plating serial dilutions in LB (including appropriate antibiotics depending on bacterial strain) and incubating at 37 °C overnight.Day 5Count bacterial CFU on plates.Intracellular burden at 24 h post-infection for various treatment groups and/or bacterial strains should be normalized to the corresponding 1 h adherence/invasion counts. Bacterial burden for each strain and/or group can be plotted using your favorite graphing program (Excel, GraphPad, etc.). Unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests can be used to determine statistical significance, which is defined as attaining p-values ≤ 0.05."
