    "Figure 2 gives a schematic presentation of the timeline for preparing the cells for lipid mixing experiments.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200302/20200302171046_3348.jpgFigure 2. Schematic presentation of the timeline for preparing and labeling the cells for lipid mixing experiments. The labeling of the cells is started 48 h post differentiation (i.e., 48 h after placing the cells into DM). Differently labeled cells are mixed 1 h later at 49 h post differentiation.Collagen-coating dishesCoat the dishes (60 x 15 mm) (two dishes for each condition) and 35 x 10 mm dishes (5 dishes for each condition) with collagen by covering the dishes with 3 ml or 1.5 ml of 1:10 solution of collagen in sterile water for 60 x 15 mm dish and 35 x 10 mm dish, respectively, and, after overnight incubation at room temperature and two washes (3 ml and 2 ml each for large and small dishes, respectively) with water, dry the dishes in the biosafety cabinet.CellsGrow C2C12 cells in the proliferation medium (PM) in the collagen-coated dishes to 75% confluency. Transfer the cells into the differentiation medium (DM) (t = 0). By 48 h post differentiation (t = 48 h), the cells spread to ~90% confluency and the first myotubes are observed. At this time, wash the cells in each of the two dishes with 2 ml PBS and place the cells in 2 ml fresh PBS.Cell labelingLabel the cells in dish 1 with CellTrackerTM Green and cells in dish 2 either with Orange CMRA CellTracker or with DiI. To label with CellTrackerTM Green; add 4 μl of the CellTrackerTM Green stock solution (50 μg of the probe in 20 μl of DMSO) to 2 ml of PBS and incubate the cells in this medium for 15 min at 37 °C.",
    "Then place the cells into complete DM for 30 min at 37 °C. Use the same procedure for labeling with Orange CMRA CellTracker. To label cells with DiI, inject 4 μl of 1 mM DiI stock solution into 2 ml of PBS at 37 °C and incubate the cells for 45 min. Wash the cells in the dishes 1 and 2 three times with 2 ml of DM and two times with 2 ml of PBS.Co-plating differently labeled cellsGently lift the cells in dishes 1 and 2 with 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA 0.05% applied for 1 min at 37 °C. During the subsequent 2-3 min incubation already at the room temperature, check whether the cells started to round up and lift. When they do, remove EDTA-trypsin and lift the cells into 4 ml of complete DM at 37 °C. Collect the cells from dishes 1 and 2 into the same 15 ml tube and mix the cells by vortexing. Adjust the volume to 10 ml. Then plate the cells (2 ml of cell suspension) onto each of five collagen-treated small dishes (35 x 10 mm). Two hours later, remove debris and non-attached cells by changing the medium for the fresh DM.Use coplating of the cells labeled with different CellTrackers to analyze content mixing between the cells. In the absence of content mixing, use coplating of the cells labeled with CellTrackerTM Green and cells labeled with DiI to analyze lipid mixing.At t = 72 h, fix the cells with 10% Formalin in phosphate buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Stain the nuclei by replacing Formalin with PBS supplemented with Hoechst (10 mg/ml stock diluted 1,000-fold) applied for 30 min at room temperature. Replace Hoechst-supplemented PBS with PBS. Take the images on a fluorescence microscope using appropriate excitation and emission filters."
