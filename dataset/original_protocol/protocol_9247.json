    "1. Preparation of the Horizontal Native Polyacrylamide Gel4.\nPreparation of the materials needed.\nFor the horizontal gel apparatus, use a gel box (37 cm x 24 cm) with a 27 cm x 21 cm tray and a capacity for two 24-well combs. This setup provides a total of 48 samples that can be analyzed simultaneously.\nPrepare the following reagents: 40% Acrylamide-Bis 19:1, 5x TBE (Tris-Borate-EDTA pH 8.0), TEMED, and 10% APS (ammonium persulfate).\nGeneration of a 10% native acrylamide gel.\nIn a 500 mL flask, add 80 mL of 5x TBE, 100 mL of 40% acrylamide, and water to a final volume of 400 mL.\nAdd 4 mL of 10% APS and 400 µL of TEMED. Mix well.\nPour the mix into the horizontal casting tray and allow the gel to polymerize for 30 min. The gel will be approximately 2 cm thick.\n\t\tNOTE: Gels can cast in a fume hood to speed up polymerization. After polymerization, a thin layer of liquid will remain on top of the gel.\nPour the liquid off and rinse with running buffer. Remove the comb(s) carefully and rinse the wells with running buffer using a syringe.\nPreparation of running buffer.\nPrepare 2 L of 1x TBE running buffer for the gel box. Dilute 400 mL of 5XTBE with 1600 mL and mix. Place 1x TBE buffer in cold room to cool.\nPre-Running the gel\nAdd 2 L of cold running buffer to the gel box and insert the gel.\nPre-run the gel at 120 V for 1 h at 4 °C in a cold room. During this time, prepare the binding reaction.\n2. Binding Reaction8\n2.1.Prepare the following reaction components.\n\t20 mM DTT\n\t10 mM BSA\n\t10 mM yeast tRNAs",
    "5X binding buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 250 mM KCl, 0.2% Tween-20)\n\t100 nM fluorescein labeled RNA purchased commercially\n\tConcentrated Bicaudal-C protein\n\t50% glycerol in DEPC-treated H2O\n\tDEPC-treated H2O\nAssemble the binding reaction components in an RNase free microcentrifuge tube.\nTo the tube, add 5 µL of 10 mM BSA, 5 µL of 20 mM DTT, 5 µL of 10 mM yeast tRNAs, 10 µL of 5x Binding Buffer.\nAdd protein to a final concentration of 250 nM in 50 µL. Add water to a final volume of 45 µL.\nAdd 5 µL of fluorescently labeled RNA substrate. Use a commercially purchased 3' fluorescein labeled 32-nucleotide substrate.\nMix and incubate in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.\n3. Analysis of Samples on the Native Horizontal Polyacrylamide Gel\nTo each reaction, add 15 µL of 50% glycerol and mix gently.\nCarefully add 30 µL of each reaction to the gel. The amount of sample that can be loaded into a single well varies depending on the thickness of the gel and the size of the wells. We have loaded volumes as little as 15 µL and as much as 45 µL into a single well of gels created with a 24-well comb and poured to a thickness of 2 cm.\nAfter connecting the power supply to the gel apparatus switch on the power and adjust the voltage. Run the gel in 4 °C at 120 V.\n\tNOTE: For the horizontal gel apparatus, this ends up being approximately 5 V/cm. For the vertical gel apparatus, this is 16 V/cm.\n\t\nTo prevent damaging or bleaching of the fluorescently labeled RNA, conduct electrophoresis in the dark.\nVary electrophoresis times depending upon the specifics of the RNA-protein complex being analyzed.",
    "NOTE: A major advantage of the horizontal EMSA analysis is that electrophoresis can be stopped, the gel imaged and then the gel can be placed back into the apparatus and electrophoresis can be continued for longer times.\n4. Imaging the Gel\nPerform analysis with any instrument designed for detection and imaging fluorescent substrates.\nPlace the gel on the imager.\nAdjust imager settings. For fluorescein-labeled RNA ligands, use the following settings: FAM (wavelength 473 nm), 750 Photomultiplier voltage (PMT), 100 µm pixel size.\nScan the gel to capture image.\nSubscription Required.
