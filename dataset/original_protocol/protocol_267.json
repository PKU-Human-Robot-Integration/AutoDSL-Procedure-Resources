    "A) Preparation of tumour-bearing mouse \n1. Disperse colon26 cells stably expressing Nano-lantern \\(1.0 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL) in Hank’s solution.\n  2. One hundred microliters of a single cell suspension was subcutaneously transplanted on the back of a mouse using a BD Lo-dose syringe 30G with a 30G needle.\n  _Critical: Keep the cell suspension on ice. Before filling the syringe with the cell suspension, it should be mixed well using a 1-mL pipette tip with the pointed end cut off._\n3. Maintain the mice on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with constant temperature and humidity.\n  \nB) Construction of the homemade luminescence-imaging system\n4. Construct a light-tight box using an aluminium angle box \\(large) and a shade curtain \\(Fig. 1A).\n  5. Attach a C-mount lens to a CCD camera and put the CCD camera in a small aluminium angle box. The aluminium angle box and CCD camera should be placed in a corrugated cardboard box to keep the mice under the imaging system \\(Fig. 1B). The small aluminium angle box, CCD camera, and light source should be put in the light tight box to block out stray light from the experiment room. Place the stainless steel box under the CCD camera.\n  _Critical: To allow soft illumination into the stainless steel box, reduce the light power \\(using an ND filter or something similar), attach a light diffuser to spread the light, and turn the output end of the light source toward the roof of the shade curtain._\nC) Construction of an alternative shutter control system",
    "CCD cameras have a “read-out time” to transfer signals to the AD converter. Therefore, the exposure time signal sequence has a square wave of “exposure on” and “exposure off” signals. The exposure time out signals from the CCD camera are used as the “trigger” signals for the multi-function wave generator that can generate a trigger input for the shutter \\(Fig. 1C). An oscilloscope is used to monitor the timing signals.\n6. Set the CCD camera parameters for video-rate imaging. Generally, the exposure time will be set to 0.033 s \\(30 Hz) and frame-transfer \\(or over-lapped) mode for the fastest data transfer from the CCD to the PC.\n  7. Connect the exposure time out signals from the CCD camera to one of the oscilloscope’s channels with a BNC cable and a BNC branch connector to monitor timing signals.\n  8. Connect the exposure time out signal from the BNC branch connector explained in the second step to the multi-function generator’s trigger input.\n  9. Set the parameters of the multi-function generator to generate the following signals: Function generation mode, burst; wave form, square; amplitude, 0–5 V; frequency, 15 Hz; cycle number, 1; phase, -1 degree; duty ratio, less than 50%. The output signals of the multi-function generator should be connected to another channel of the oscilloscope to simultaneously monitor the exposure out signals.",
    "_Critical: The parameters described above generate “one pulse” signals in response to the exposure time out signals of the CCD camera. The more important parameters are duty ratio and phase. Because the shutter device has both electrical and mechanical jitter \\(the delay time from ideal time signals), phase and duty ratio adjustments are required to prevent light leaking into another exposure time. Changing the duty ratio changes the duration time of the “turning on” time during exposure. Phase adjustment may be required to avoid pulse generation during another exposure time. However, if the shutter is mechanical, the jitter lasts several for microseconds. In that case, turning on and off the shutter timing may be ignored. If the light control will be performed by faster devices, such as LED power modulation, phase adjustment is essential<sup>6</sup>. Instead of adjusting the duty ratio, the frequency can be changed._\n10. Connect the output of the multi-function generator to the external input of the shutter device.\n  _Critical: To prevent light leaking from one exposure time to another, duty ratio and phase adjustment are required by imaging alternate excitation._\nD) Alternate luminescent and bright-field imaging of the freely moving mouse\n11. Dissolve 8 μg of coelenterazine-h in ethanol, and then dilute it in 1× PBS.\n  Critical step: The final concentration of ethanol should be less than 20%.\n12. Inject coelenterazine-h solution intratumourally with a BD Lo-dose syringe 30G.\n  13. Put the mouse onto the stainless steel box in the light-tight box, tightly close the shade curtain and start video-rate imaging."
