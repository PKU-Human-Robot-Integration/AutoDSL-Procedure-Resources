    "1. Plasmid construction\nBegin by deciding which histone protein will be acetylated and at which lysine site. Mutate the site to the amber stop codon (TAG) using site directed mutagenesis.\n\t​NOTE: There are four previously designed plasmids utilized for expression of histone proteins. All four histone proteins were cloned into the pETDuet-1 vector with an N-terminal histidine tag. Histone H4 also includes a SUMO tag, the origin of replication colE1 with a copy number of approximately 40, ampicillin resistant, and a T7 promoter.\n\t\nDesign forward and reverse primers that contain a TAG mutation at the desired site (replacing an existing lysine codon with the amber stop codon) in one of the four histone protein plasmids.\nUse whole-plasmid PCR to amplify the TAG containing plasmid. Determine an appropriate annealing temperature for the primers. In general, the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers minus 5 °C will be sufficient. If difficulty is experienced obtaining a PCR product, a temperature gradient around Tm - 5 °C can be used to optimize the annealing temperature for amplification.\n\t\tNOTE: In this experiment an in-house expressed PFU polymerase was used for 30 cycles with the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s (denaturation), annealing temperature for 30 s, and 72 °C for 6 min (or 1 min per kilobase-pairs). For more details on this type of PCR method see Liu and Naismith7.\nClean up the PCR product with a PCR clean up kit by following the manufacturer's protocol. Analyze the PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent ethidium bromide staining.\nLigate the plasmid by incubating with T4 ligase overnight at 16 °C.",
    "First transform the TAG containing plasmid (AmpR) into chemically competent Escherichia coli. Pick a minimum of 4 colonies from the transformation and purify the plasmid. Make cell stocks of each with glycerol using standard methods and store at -80 °C. Send for sequencing to confirm the desired TAG mutation.\nOnce the sequence is confirmed, co-transform the TAG-containing plasmid (AmpR) with pEVOL-AckRS (ChlR) into chemically competent CobB (the only histone lysine deacetylase known in E. coli.) deletion BL21 cells using the heat shock method. pEVOL is a plasmid with a mid-copy-number to low-copy-number p15A origin.\n\tNOTE: The pEVOL series of plasmids were constructed based on previous studies that showed an increased expression of the orthogonal aaRS/tRNATyr pair was effective in decreasing protein truncation and in increasing overall yields of mutant proteins8. If CobB deletion cells are not accessible, proceed with chemically competent BL21 cells. CobB is a Sirtuin-like histone lysine deacetylase and Nicotinamide can be added at a 5 mM final concentration during histone protein expression to inhibit CobB as an alternative approach9.\nMake a cell stock and store at -80 °C.\n2. Acetylated histone protein expression\nPrepare 1 L of autoclaved 2YT media (or volume of choice) in a culture flask.\nInoculate 20 mL of 2YT media containing the appropriate antibiotics with the co-transformed cell stock that has the TAG-containing plasmid (AmpR) and pEVOL-AckRS (ChlR) and grow at 37 °C to OD = 0.6 (4-6 h).\nAdd the appropriate antibiotics to the 1 L of autoclaved 2YT media and inoculate with the 20 mL starter culture. Grow at 37 °C to OD = 0.6-0.8 (2-3 h).\nAdd inducing agents and acetyllysine (AcK) to the final concentrations of IPTG 1 mM, 0.2% arabinose, and AcK 5 mM.\nGrow the culture at 37 °C for 6-8 h.",
    "Pellet cells at 2,700 x g for 15 min.\nStore the cell pellet at -80 °C overnight.\nFrom this step onwards keep the sample on ice all times. Dissolve the cell pellet in 50 mL of histone lysis buffer per 1 L of culture.\nSonicate according to the following cycle: 1 s on, 1 s off, total on time: 3 min at 60% amplitude.\nPellet inclusion bodies at 41,600 x g for 45 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend inclusion bodies in 30 mL of histone lysis buffer. Pellet inclusion bodes at 41,600 x g for 30 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend inclusion bodies in 30 mL of pellet wash buffer. Pellet inclusion bodies at 41,600 x g for 30 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and dissolve inclusion bodies in 25 mL of 6 M Guanidine Hydrochloride (GuHCl) buffer. Incubate with agitation at 37 °C for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: If needed, inclusion bodies can be incubated with agitation overnight at 4 °C.\nPellet inclusion bodes at 41,600 x g for 45 min. Incubate the supernatant with 1 mL of Ni-NTA resin equilibrated with 6 M GuHCl buffer for 2 h.\nProceed with Ni-NTA purification under denatured conditions. Wash the column with 3 column volumes of column wash buffer. Elute acetylated histone protein with 10 mL of elution buffer.\n\tNOTE: Attempting to concentrate the protein here is an option but acetylated histones are very unpredictable and can easily precipitate. It is not recommended to concentrate past 2 mL in total volume.\nExtensively dialyze the acetylated histone protein against 5% acetic acid buffer to remove salts. Dialyze for 3 h at a time at 4 °C, exchanging for fresh buffer a minimum of 6 times.",
    "NOTE: For improved protein purity, there is an option to dialyze against pure water. However, this causes significant precipitation and reduction in yield which may be undesirable for low-yielding acetylated histone proteins.\nAliquot and lyophilize protein, and store indefinitely at -80 °C. Wild type histone proteins generally yield 10-50 mg/L whereas acetylated histone proteins yield less than 10 mg/L depending on the specific lysine site. For example, H3K79Ac averages 5 mg/L.\n3. Wild-type histone protein expression\nTo assemble full nucleosomes, express all 4 histone proteins. When expressing and purifying wild type histones the protocol is the same as the acetylated histones except the following:\n\t\nDo not perform co-transformation. Do not use pEVOL-AcKRS for wild type histone expression. Adjust antibiotics accordingly.\nDo not use a CobB deletion cell line or add Nicotinamide, AcK, or arabinose during induction of cellular expression.\n4. Preparation of 601 DNA\nNOTE: A previously designed optimized DNA sequence to direct nucleosome positioning is assembled with histone octamers to produce mononucleosome with high efficiency. This sequence is referred to as 601 DNA or the Widom sequence. This sequence has become the standard DNA sequence for in vitro studies of nucleosomes from chromatin remodeling assays to single molecule measurements10.\nTo prepare significant quantities of 601 DNA for nucleosome assembly, transform pGEM-3z/601 into Top 10 cells and grow 10 mL of culture for plasmid amplification and extraction. Use a plasmid extraction kit and follow manufacturer's recommendation.\nUse an in-house expressed PFU polymerase (more efficient) for this amplification protocol. Set up a PCR reaction: For 250 µL reaction, use 207.5 µL autoclaved MQ H2O, 25 µL 10x PFU Buffer, 5 µL Forward Primer: ctggagaatcccggtgccg, 5 µL Reverse Primer: acaggatgtatatatctgacacg, 5 µL dNTP mix, 2.5 µL PFU enzyme. We typically run 60 reactions at once to get enough DNA to assemble.",
    "Use an annealing temperature of 52 °C for 30 s and an extension time of 30 s if using PFU polymerase. Otherwise follow the manufacturers recommended conditions.\nOnce PCR is done, use a PCR clean up kit of choice to purify the PCR product.\n5. Assembly of histone octamer\nDissolve aliquots of histone protein pellets H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 so that there is a separate stock of each histone protein in GuHCl Buffer with a total volume of 100 µL.\nCalculate the concentration of each histone protein by measuring the A280 absorbance.\nIf absorbance is greater than 1 for any protein, dilute with GuHCl buffer to get a more accurate concentration.\nCombine H2A and H2B proteins in a 1:1 molar ratio and dilute to a total protein concentration of 4 µg/µL. Repeat for H3 and H4.\nDialyze sequentially at 4 °C against 2 M TE buffer overnight, 1 M TE buffer for 2 h and 0.5 M TE buffer for 5 h.\n\tNOTE: The second and third steps of dialysis causes unstable conformations of protein to precipitate out. It is expected to see heavy precipitation at these steps.\nRemove precipitates by centrifugation at 16,800 x g at 4 °C.\nAgain, calculate the concentration of histone dimers (H2A/H2B mixture) and tetramers (H3/H4 mixture) measuring the A280 absorbance.\nMix dimers and tetramers in a 1:1 molar ratio and adjust NaCl to 2 M by the addition of solid NaCl.\nHistone octamer can be stored at 4 °C and is more stable than dimers and tetramers. Never freeze histone octamer as this can cause disassembly.\nIf assembling with acetylated histones, simply replace the wild type protein with the acetylated protein in the procedure.\n6. Nucleosome assembly",
    "Use 100x TE buffer and solid NaCl to adjust 601 DNA to 2M TE buffer. Add the 601 DNA in 2M TE buffer to histone octamer in a molar ratio of 0.85:1 to 0.90:1. A lower ratio of DNA may be added if free DNA is present in the gel shift analysis.\nTransfer the DNA-histone mixture a dialysis bag and place in about 200 mL of 2M TE buffer (or more if assembling multiple samples) and very gently stir at 4 °C.\nSet a peristaltic pump to purge to slowly drip in no salt TE buffer. When the volume has roughly doubled, pour out half the volume. Do this at least 4 times in total. With a pump this can take 4-8 h depending on the starting volume. Nucleosomes form when the salt concentration is reduced to 150 mM (measured by salinity meter).\nAfter the salt concentration is reduced to 150 mM, dialyze against a 20 mM TE buffer overnight.\nRemove precipitates by centrifugation and measure the concentration of the nucleosomes by A260 reading using a plate reader.\nAdd His-TEV protease (TEV: nucleosome 1:30, w:w ) and incubate overnight at 4 °C to remove all histidine tags. Remove the histidine tag impurities from the nucleosome solution by Ni-NTA resin pull down.\nTo position the nucleosome and homogenize the sample, incubate at 60 °C for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: For acetylated sites that are particularly unstable, this step may not be advisable.\nStore nucleosomes for short term (a few weeks) at 4 °C.\nFor long-term storage, dialyze nucleosomes against storage buffer and store at -80 °C.\nSubscription Required.
