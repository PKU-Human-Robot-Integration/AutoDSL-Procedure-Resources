Make a solution of 10 mM D-(+)-chiro-inositol in ddH2O.",
    "The internal standard will be required for signal normalization correcting any variation in the chemical reaction efficiency. Accuracy in the preparation of this solution is therefore extremely important. To enhance accuracy of the quantification between each derivatization procedure, using the same internal standard batch lot is recommended. D-chiro-inositol is stable for at least one year at −20°C. Freezing 500 µl aliquots of this solution is preferable and avoid freeze thaw cycles.\nPreparation of the calibration sets\n2. Make a solution of each calibration monosaccharide (arabinose, rhamnose, fucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, glucose, glucuronic acid, N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine) at 100 mM in ddH2O.\nThese monosaccharides are the most commonly found in microbial polymers, but others can be added to this list according to the sample to be analyzed. However, this list was designed to avoid monosaccharide co-elution and accurate quantification. If additional monosaccharides are needed, treat the new monosaccharide calibrator initially as a sample to identify its retention time and fragmentation profile. According to the results, the new calibrator could either be added to this preselection, be swapped with an existing calibrator or be independently quantified.\nThese solutions will be used for quantification of each monosaccharide. As with the internal standard, accuracy is extremely important while preparing these solutions. They can also be aliquoted and stored at −20°C.\n3. Mix all the calibration monosaccharide solutions together to obtain a calibrant mix at 10 mM.\n4. Prepare two calibration sets by pipetting 10 µl, 50 µl, 100 µl, 250 µl and 500 µl calibrant mix in sure-stop vials.\n5. Add 10 µl of 10 mM D-(+)-chiro-inositol to all sure-stop vials.\n6. Evaporate the two calibration sets using the sample concentrator equipped with one PTFE-coated needle per sample.\nPreparation of the cell wall samples",
    "7. Add ∼0.5 mg of fungal cell wall sample to each of 2 sure-stop vials using a spatula and an analytical precision balance.\nDocument the exact weight of cell wall placed into each vial, this weight will be required to normalize the data obtained from the 2 vials.\n8. Add 10 µl of 10 mM D-(+)-chiro-inositol to all sure-stop vials.\nHydrolysis\n9. Preheat oven 1 to 100°C.\n10. Preheat oven 2 to 110°C.\n11. Add 250 µl of 6 M HCl to one of your sample vials and to one calibration set.\n12. Cap the vials.\n13. Incubate at 100°C for 4 hr.\nThis hydrolysis protocol will allow the degradation of N-acetylhexosamine polymers such as chitin and A. fumigatus galactosaminogalactan. N-acetylhexosamines will be quantified using this calibration curve.\n14. Add 250 µl of 2 M TFA to the remaining sample vial and calibration set.\n15. Cap the vials.\n16. Incubate at 110°C for 2 hr.\nThis hydrolysis protocol will allow degradation of pentose and hexose polymers such as glucans and mannans. These monosaccharides will be quantified using this calibration curve.\n17. Evaporate the acid completely using the sample concentrator.\nMethanolysis\n18. Dilute the 3 M hydrogen chloride solution to 1 M with methanol.\nAlways prepare this solution immediately prior to use.\n19. Add at least 100 µl of the diluted hydrogen chloride solution to all sure-stop vials.\n20. Incubate overnight at 80°C in one of the ovens previously used.\nAppropriate closure of the vials is critical for this step. Any mishandling will lead to evaporation and subsequent burning of the sample or calibrant. Some evaporation is acceptable and will be controlled by the internal standard.\nRe-N-acetylation of amino sugars\n21. Evaporate the hydrogen chloride solution using the sample concentrator.\n22. Add 500 µl methanol to all sure-stop vials.",
    "23. Evaporate the methanol using the sample concentrator.\n24. Repeat steps 22 and 23.\n25. Prepare a solution of methanol:pyridine (5:1).\n26. Add 600 µl of the methanol/pyridine solution to each vial.\n27. Add 150 µl acetic anhydride to each vial, cap the vials and quickly swirl to mix.\nCaution should be taken as the addition of the acetic anhydride will result in an exothermic reaction occurring with your sample and the methanol:pyridine solvent. Do not premix the reagents prior to addition to the sample. Quickly swirl your vials following the addition of the acetic anhydride to ensure its homogenous distribution.\n28. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature.\nPersilylation\n29. Preheat oven to 110°C.\n30. Evaporate the re-N-acetylation mix with the sample concentrator.\n31. Wash twice all sure-stop vials with 500 µl methanol.\n32. Add at least 50 µl of TriSil-HTP reagent to each sure-stop vial.\n33. Incubate at 110°C for 20 min.\nSample preparation for injection into the GC-MS\n34. Dry down the Tri-Sil HTP mix with the sample concentrator.\n35. Wash twice all sure-stop vials with 500 µl cyclohexane.\n36. Reconstitute all sure-stop vials with 1 ml cyclohexane.\n37. Place all the sure-stop vials in the autosampler.\nPreparation of the GC-MS\nFor monosaccharide analysis the gas chromatograph uses helium as a carrier gas and the Agilent CP-Sil-5CB capillary column as stationary phase. The mass spectrometer is equipped with the extraction source XtrEI350. All GC-MS parameters for settings and analysis are controlled by the MassHunter software suite.\n38. Prepare a blank by adding 1 ml cyclohexane to a sure-stop vial.\n39. Fill 2 wash vials with cyclohexane for the injector needle to clean pre and post sampling.\n40. Tune the mass spectrometer using the EI extraction tune method furnished by the machine supplier.",
    "41. Implement your samples information into the autosampler interface.\n42. Implement the gas chromatography parameters with the following gradient:\n         \nHold 120°C for 2 min.\n120°C to 160°C at 15°C/min.\n160°C to 195°C at 1.5°C/min.\n195°C to 280°C at 30°C/min.\nHold 280°C for 1.5 min.\n43. Implement MS acquisition parameters as follows:\n         \nStart acquisition at t = 6 min.\nScan from m/z 50 to 400 at a frequency of 4.1 scans/s.\nSingle ion monitoring (SIM) of 3 ions under a cycle of 8.33 Hz: m/z 204 from t = 6 min to 18.5 min, m/z 305 from t = 18.5 min to 21 min, and m/z 173 from t = 21 min to 30 min.\nInjection\n44. Inject 1 µl of each sample and calibrant using the ALS syringe, inserting a blank injection between each sample injection.",
    "This Support Protocol presents the different steps required to extract the fungal cell wall from fungal biomass. This protocol can be applied to any fungal specie and in any required experimental settings. As cell walls are dynamic components of the cell, any change in the growth conditions and time of extraction can impact the composition obtained. Therefore, no specific instruction regarding the culture is given.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol)\nAbsolute ethanol (Greenfield global Inc. P016EAAN equivalent)\nFungal biomass\nChloroform (FisherScientific C606-4 or equivalent)\nAcetone (FisherScientific A18-4 or equivalent)\nWater bath (Montreal Biotech WBE05A11B or equivalent)\nMiracloth (MilliporeSigma 475855-1R or equivalent)\n50-ml conical tubes (VWR 82050-346 or equivalent)\nFreeze drier (Labconco)\nBiosafety cabinet\nTenbroeck tissue grinder (FisherScientific 06-421-40 or equivalent)\nTable-top centrifuge (ThermoScientific Sorvall Legend RT 75004377 or equivalent)\nVortex\nNutator\nFume hood\n1. Set the water bath to 70°C.\n2. Prepare a solution of 70% ethanol.\n3. Filter the biomass out of its culture medium on Miracloth.\n4. Squeeze biomass in the Miracloth to remove as much culture supernatant as possible.\n5. Transfer biomass to a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube.\n6. Add 40 ml of 70% ethanol to fungal biomass to wash out the culture supernatant.\n7. Shake vigorously.\n8. Discard the ethanol supernatant.\n9. Place the biomass in the freeze drier at −20°C to freeze.\n10. Freeze dry the biomass.\nSteps 9 and 10 are facultative but presents two advantages: It is a lot easier to crush dried biomass than wet biomass, and it will kill the fungi allowing crushing outside of a biosafety cabinet (BSC) (if spores are present, please observe appropriate safety measure, as they could survive the freezing process).\n11. Reconstitute biomass into 70% ethanol and transfer some to the tissue grinder.",
    "The amount of biomass and volume of ethanol to transfer at once to the tissue grinder are at the discretion of the experimenter. The difficulty of the crushing completion is directly proportional to the amount of biomass added to the grinder. It is possible to reduce the amount of biomass to crush at once and repeat this step. Use a minimum of 15 ml ethanol at a time.\n12. Crush fungal biomass until only very fine particles remain.\nIf step 9 was omitted, remain within a BSC if the fungi to crush require containment as an aerosol will be created.\n13. Incubate the crushed biomass suspended in 70% ethanol in the water bath for 15 min.\n14. Centrifuge 5 min at 2200 × g, room temperature.\n15. Discard the ethanol supernatant.\n16. Resuspend the pellet in 40 ml fresh 70% ethanol solution.\nResuspension can be hard to achieve by shaking or vortexing alone; you can use a clean spatula to smear out the pellet along the walls of the tube before completing the resuspension.\n17. Repeat steps 13 to 16 twice.\n18. Resuspend the pellet of the last ethanol wash in 40 ml of methanol:chloroform (1:1).\n19. Incubate on a nutator (or shaking platform) overnight.\n20. Centrifuge 5 min at 2200 × g, room temperature.\n21. Discard the methanol:chloroform supernatant.\n22. Resuspend the pellet in 40 ml acetone.\n23. Incubate on a nutator (or shaking platform) for at least 2 hr.\n24. Centrifuge 5 min at 2200 × g, room temperature.\n25. Discard the acetone supernatant.\n26. Dry the pellet overnight by leaving the conical tube opened in a fume hood.\nTo accelerate the evaporation of the acetone, it is recommended to smear the pellet along the wall of the conical tubes (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.853#cpz1853-fig-0001]).",
    "Once the pellet has dried, it will lose its grey color and turn white (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.853#cpz1853-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c7ec9b1b-5607-4337-b169-28ddfb615dcc/cpz1853-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nCell wall preparation final steps. (A) Material obtained after discarding the acetone wash. (B) Smearing this material will facilitate the drying of the cell wall. (C) Final cell wall extract after complete acetone evaporation.\n27. Break down the dry pellet by vigorously shaking the conical tube.\nWhen stored at room temperature, the cell wall preparation will be stable for an extended period of time."
