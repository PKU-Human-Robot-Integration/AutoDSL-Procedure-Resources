    "1. C. elegans maintenance and culture\nGrow and synchronize worms colonies to their fourth larvae (L4) stage following standard laboratory procedures8.\nThe day of IV-FPOP experiment, wash L4 worms from bacterial lawns (OP50 E. coli) with M9 buffer (0.02 M KH2PO4, 0.08 M Na2HPO4, 0.08 M NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4).\nObtain 500 µL aliquots of ~10,000 worms per IV-FPOP sample.\n2. Microfluidic flow system assembly\nStart the flow system assembly by cutting a 2 cm piece of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing (1/16 in. outer diameter (o.d.) x 0.020 in. inner diameter (i.d.)).\nUsing a clean dissecting needle, widen the i.d. of the FEP tubing in order to make a small crater at one end only, ~50 mm in length. The crater should be big enough to fit two 360 µm o.d. pieces of fused silica.\n\tNOTE: Do not widen the opposite end as this end will only be used to fit the outlet capillary.\nWith a ceramic cutter, cut two 15 cm pieces of 250 µm i.d. fused silica. These two pieces will become the infusing lines of the flow system.\nUsing self-adhesive tape, tape the two 250 µm i.d. capillaries together ensuring they are parallel to each other and their ends are 100% flushed.\n\tNOTE: To ensure the fused silica ends are not crushed after cutting, and are straight and 100% flushed against each other, it is recommended to examine them using a magnifying glass or under a stereo microscope.\nInsert the two taped capillaries into the handmade crater of the FEP tubing. Push the capillaries up to the very edge of the handmade crater.\n\tCAUTION: To maintain the efficacy of the flow system, do not push past the handmade crater (Figure 1a).",
    "Place a small dot of epoxy resin on a clean surface and mix with a dissecting needle.\nQuickly, using the same needle, place a small drop of resin at the end of the infusing capillaries where they connect with the FEP tubing and allow the resin to dry, hanging outlet-side up, for a few minutes (Figure 1a).\nWhile the resin dries, binding the FEP tubing and two capillaries together, cut a new 250 µm i.d. capillary. The new capillary will become the outlet capillary of the flow system. The desired length of the capillary can be calculated using the equation below:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60910/60910eq1.jpg\n\tWhere ℓ is length of the capillary to be cut in centimeters, t is the desired reaction time in minutes, f is the flow rate in mL/min, and i.d. is the inner diameter of the capillary in centimeters.\n\tNOTE: After cutting the outlet capillary, examine the ends ensuring they are straight and not crushed.\nOnce the resin has dried, insert the new capillary through the FEP tubing outlet end. The inside ends of the outlet capillary and the two infusing capillaries should be flush against each other inside the FEP tubing, this creates the mixing-T (Figure 1b).\nBind the outlet capillary and FEP tubing with fresh epoxy resin as described in steps 2.6 and 2.7.\nAllow the resin to dry overnight binding the flow system together. Set up the microfluidic flow system the next day (Figure 1c).\n3. Microfluidic flow system for in vivo FPOP\nInsert four magnetic stirrers inside one 5 mL syringe. This syringe becomes the sample syringe. The magnetic stirrers prevent the worms from settling inside the syringe during IV-FPOP (Figure 2A).",
    "Fill the two 5 mL syringes with M9. Make sure there are no air bubbles inside each syringe as they can affect the flow rate and mixing efficiency.\nConnect a Luer adapter to each 5 mL syringe ensuring they are finger tight and secured in place.\nAttach each syringe to a single 3-2 valve. The syringe should be attached to the middle port of the valve (Figure 2B).\nSecure each 5 mL syringe to the dual syringe pump and adjust the mechanical stop collar to prevent over pressure to the syringe from the pusher block. Keep in mind the addition of the magnetic stirrers when setting the stop collar.\nAttach each infusing capillary end of the homemade microfluidic flow system to the top port of each 3-2 valve using a super flangeless nut, FEP sleeve, and super flangeless ferrule (Figure 2B).\nTo the remaining opened port of the 3-2 valve (bottom port), attach a 10 cm 450 µm i.d. capillary using a super flangeless nut, FEP sleeve, and super flangeless ferrule (Figure 2B). These capillaries become the withdrawing sample capillaries.\nStart the pump flow and check all connections of the microfluidic flow system for visual leaks. Flow at least three syringe volumes using the experimental flow rate. The final flow rate is dependent on the laser irradiation window, laser frequency, and a zero-exclusion fraction volume.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, a final flow rate of 375.52 µL/min was calculated from a laser irradiation window of 2.55 mm, 250 µm i.d. fused silica, zero exclusion fraction, and 50 Hz frequency.\n\t\nThe flow path is marked by the arrows on the 3-2 valve handle. Each syringe can be refilled manually by moving the valve handle from the expelling position to the withdrawing position.",
    "NOTE: Leaks at the 3-2 valve can be fixed by re-screwing the super flangeless nut or replacing any of the valve connections (super flangeless nut, FEP sleeve, or super flangeless ferrule). Leaks at the mixing-T require a reassembly of the microfluidic flow system (steps 2.1 to 2.11).\nMove the microfluidic flow system to the experimental bench and secure the outlet capillary to the radiating stage using a 360 µm o.d. stainless steel union (Figure 2C,D).\nUsing a long-reach lighter, burn the coating of the fused silica at the laser irradiation window. Clean the burned coating using lint-free tissue and methanol.\n\tNOTE: Alternate between burning cycles and methanol cleaning cycles to avoid over-heating the capillary as excess heat can melt and/or break the capillary.\nPosition the magnetic stirrer block above the 5 mL syringe containing the magnetic stirrers. Adjust the speed and position of the magnetic stirrer block so that the magnetic stirrers inside the 5 mL syringe are rotating slowly and constantly.\n4. In vivo FPOP\nTurn on the KrF excimer laser and allow the thyratron to warm-up.\n\tCAUTION: The laser emits visible and invisible radiation at 248 nm wavelength that can damage eyes. Proper eye protection should be worn before turning on the laser and opening the beam exit window.\nMeasure the laser energy at a frequency of 50 Hz for at least 100 pulses by placing the optical sensor at the beam exit window.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, a 2.55 mm irradiation window was used with a laser energy of 150 ± 2.32 mJ.\nObtain approximatively 10,000 worms (500 µL) and manually withdraw the sample into the sample syringe.",
    "Fill the sample syringe with 2.5 mL of M9 buffer for a final sample volume of 3 mL. Make sure that no air bubbles are introduced into the sample syringe.\nFill the second syringe with 3 mL of 200 mM H2O2, again ensuring no air bubbles are introduced into the syringe.\nAt the end of the outlet capillary, place a 15 mL conical tube wrapped in aluminum foil containing 6 mL of 40 mM N’-Dimethylthiourea (DMTU), 40 mM N-tert-Butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN), and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide to quench excess H2O2, hydroxyl radicals, and inhibit methionine sulfoxide reductase activity, respectively.\nStart the excimer laser from the software window, wait for the first pulse, and start the sample flow from the dual syringe.\n\tNOTE: Samples should be run in biological duplicates in technical triplicates under 3 samples conditions: laser irradiation with H2O2 (sample), no laser irradiation with H2O2 and no laser irradiation no H2O2 (controls), totaling to 9 samples per biological set.\nCollect the entire sample in the 15 mL tube, while actively monitoring the sample flow for any visual leaks as some back pressure from the sample syringe can sometimes build-up.\nFollowing IV-FPOP, pellet worms by centrifugation at 805 x g for 2 min. Remove quench solution, add 250 µL of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 0.5% SDS, 50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]). Transfer the sample to a clean microcentrifuge tube, flash freeze, and store at -80 °C until sample digestion.\n5. Protein extraction, purification, and proteolysis",
    "Thaw frozen samples on ice and homogenize by sonication for 10 s, followed by a 60 s ice incubation. Multiple rounds of sonication may be required, homogenate can be observed under a stereomicroscope by placing a 2 µL sample aliquot on a microscope slide. Sample homogenization is complete when small to no pieces of worms are seen.\nCentrifuge homogenized worms at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant into a clean microcentrifuge tube.\nDetermine sample protein concentrations using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA assay) using the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\tNOTE: Sample concentration can be determined using any biochemical protein concentration assay of choice. Keep in mind reagent compatibility with lysis buffer (8 M urea, 0.5% SDS, 50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF). Additionally, a buffer dilution may be necessary.\nObtain 100 µg of protein from each sample and place in clean microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd dithiothreitol (DTT) to a 10 mM final concentration to reduce disulfide bonds in all samples. Vortex, spin down, and incubate samples at 50 °C for 45 min.\nCool samples to room temperature for 10 min.\nAdd iodoacetamide (IAA) to a 50 mM final concentration to alkylate reduced residues. Vortex, spin down, and incubate samples for 20 min at room temperature protected from light.\nImmediately after alkylation, precipitate the protein sample by adding 4 volumes of 100% pre-chilled acetone and incubate at -20 °C overnight.\nThe next day, pellet protein precipitate by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 10 min. Wash sample pellet with 90% acetone, remove supernatant, and allow pellet to dry for 2–3 min.\nRe-suspend the protein pellet in 25 mM Tris-HCl (1 µg/µL). Add trypsin at a final protease to protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w) and digest samples at 37 °C overnight.",
    "The next day quench the trypsin digestion reaction by adding 5% formic acid.\n\tNOTE: A minimum of 0.5 µg of peptides per sample is needed for LC-MS/MS analysis (steps 6.1-6.5). Determine sample peptide concentrations using a quantitative colorimetric peptide assay (see the Table of Materials) as described by the manufacturer’s protocol.\n6. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)\nUse the following LC mobile phases: water in 0.1% FA (A) and ACN in 0.1% FA (B).\nLoad 0.5 µg of peptides onto a trap column (180 µm × 20 mm) containing C18 (5 µm, 100 Å) and wash sample with 99% solvent A and 1% B for 15 min at 15 µL/min flow rate.\nSeparate peptides using an in-house packed column (0.075 mm i.d. × 20 mm) with C18 reverse phase material (5 μm, 125 Å).\nUse the following analytical separation method: the gradient was pumped at 300 nL/min for 120 min: 0−1 min, 3% B; 2−90 min, 10−45% B; 100−105 min, 100% B; 106−120 min, 3% B.\nPerform data acquisition of peptides in positive ion mode nano-electrospray ionization (nESI) using a high-resolution mass spectrometer.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, an ultra-performance LC (UPLC) instrument couple to a high-resolution mass spectrometer was utilized. Data dependent acquisition was utilized. The m/z scan range for MS1 was 3750–1500 at 60,000 resolution and 60 s dynamic exclusion. Ions with charge states of +1 and >6 were excluded. An automatic gain control (AGC) target of 5.5e5 was used with a maximum injection time of 50 ms and an intensity threshold of 5.5e4. Ions selected for MS2 were subjected to higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation using 32% normalized collision energy. Fragment ions were detected in the spectrometer with 15,000 resolution and a 5.0e4 AGC target.\n7. Data analysis",
    "Search tandem MS files with a bottom-up proteomics analysis software against the C. elegans database.\nSet the protein analysis search parameters as follow: one trypsin missed cleavage, 375–1500 m/z peptide mass range, fragment mass tolerance of 0.02, and precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm. Carbamidomethylation is set as a static modification and all know hydroxyl radical side-chain modifications9,10 as dynamic. Peptide identification is established at 95% confidence (medium) and residue at 99% confidence (high). The false discovery rate (FDR) is set a 1%.\nExport data to an electronic database and summarize the extent of oxidation per peptide or residue using the equation below11:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60910/60910eq2.jpg\n\tNOTE: Where EIC area modified is the extracted ion chromatographic area (EIC) of the peptide or residue with an oxidative modification, and EIC area is the total area of the same peptide or residue with and without the oxidative modification."
