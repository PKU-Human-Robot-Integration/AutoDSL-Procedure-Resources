    "All experiments conducted with human material were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Tübingen and written informed consent was obtained from all patients who contributed samples to this study.\n1. Isolation and Stimulation of Jurkat cells\nNOTE: To optimize the protocol, use the Jurkat cell line which is known to express the high levels of NFAT2. All steps are performed under a laminar flow hood.\nPrepare 50 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin by warming it to 37 °C in a water bath.\nCulture Jurkat cells for 1-2 d in a cell culture flask at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in 20 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to a density of approximately 2 x 106 cells/mL (cells are counted with Trypan blue staining and a Neubauer chamber under the microscope) and harvest them by centrifuging for 5 min at 200 x g.\nRemove the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Subsequently, count the cells with a conventional trypan blue staining and a Neubauer chamber under the microscope.\nCentrifuge the cells from step 1.3 for 5 min at 200 x g and remove the supernatant by aspiration. Then, resuspend the cells at a density of 2 x 107 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and transfer 1 mL in a new conventional 5 mL tube by pipetting.\nStimulate the cells by adding 32.4 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1 µM ionomycin. Then incubate the cells for 16 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with the lid of the tube opened (to avoid contamination, a sealing film permeable to air can be used).",
    "2. Isolation and Stimulation of Primary CLL Cells from Human Patients\nNOTE: Patient samples were acquired and stimulated as previously described7. All steps are performed under a laminar flow hood.\nPrepare the equipment necessary to draw blood from patients and to perform a density gradient separation: 21-G needles, tourniquet, NH4-heparin-blood collection syringes (e.g., S-monovettes), 1x PBS, and density gradient medium (density 1.077 g/mL).\nUpon venipuncture, draw the blood from CLL patients (ca. 40 mL blood per patient) into the syringes. Then transfer the blood in 50 mL conical tubes. Wash the syringe with 10 mL PBS and pool the blood-PBS-suspension in the 50 mL tubes (adjust the number of tubes to the volume of blood).\nPrepare 15 mL of the density gradient medium in a fresh 50 mL conical tube. Subsequently, layer 35 mL of the blood-PBS-suspension carefully on the density gradient medium. For this purpose, hold the tube at a flat angle and slowly pipette the blood-PBS-suspension against the bottom wall of the 50 mL conical tube. As more of the blood-PBS-suspension is accumulating in the 50 mL conical tube, increase the angle of the tube up to a right angle. Repeat this step according to the volume of the blood-PBS-suspension.\nPerform centrifugation at 560 x g for 20 min (without brake), then extract the mononuclear cell phase which contains the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To do so, collect the white interphase of the density gradient separation with a 5 mL serological pipette and transfer it to a new 50 mL conical tube.",
    "Fill the cell-suspension to 50 mL with PBS and centrifuge for 5 min at 360 x g. Remove the supernatant by aspiration. Repeat this step with centrifugation for 5 min at 275 x g. Then, pool the cells of one patient in 5-10 mL of PBS in a 50 mL conical tube.\nCount the cells as described in 1.3.\n\tNOTE: It depends on the proportion of CLL cells in the isolated PBMCs, if the cells can be used directly for this procedure or a B cell isolation has to be conducted, e.g., via magnetic cell sorting (MACS). The B cell isolation is recommended but can be omitted if the proportion of CLL cells is above 95% of total lymphocytes (determined via flow cytometry). Blood of CLL patients is fixed and lysed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then a staining with CD19-FITC and CD5-PE antibodies is performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and the cells are analyzed via flow cytometry. One exemplary patient is shown in Figure 1, in which the proportion of CLL cells is 89.03%. Thus, a B cell isolation has to be performed in this patient. The proportion of physiological B cells is negligible (3.72% in the example).\nWash the cells with 10 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 200 x g and remove the supernatant by aspiration.\nAdjust the cells to 2 x 107 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol (37 °C) and fill 1 mL of the cell suspension into a 5 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: The ß-mercaptoethanol is employed to counteract oxidative stress.",
    "Stimulate the cells by adding 32.4 nM PMA and 1 µM ionomycin. Then incubate the cells for 16 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with the lid of the tube opened (to avoid contamination, a sealing film permeable to air can be used).\n\tNOTE: To reduce the level of stress the cells can be rested for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the incubator prior to the 16 h of stimulation.\n3. Fixation, Cell Lysis, and Chromatin Shearing\nNOTE: Patient samples and Jurkat cells are fixed and lysed with a commercially available ChIP kit according to the manufacturer's instructions with modifications as described previously7. The fixation is performed under a laminar flow hood.\nPrepare a 1.5 mL tube with 1 mL of 37% formaldehyde, a 1.5 mL tube with 1 mL of 1.25 M glycine, a 5 mL tube with 4 mL of 1x PBS and a box with ice for the fixation of the cells.\nAfter stimulation of the cells for the respective incubation time in step 1.5 or 2.9, spin the 5 mL tubes at 200 x g for 5 min and resuspend the cells in 500 µL of PBS in the 5 mL tubes.\nAdd 340 µM formaldehyde (13.5 µL of 37% formaldehyde) to the cells. After brief mixing by carefully pipetting up and down incubate the suspension for 2.5 min (Jurkat cells) or 5 min (patient sample) at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Prolonged fixation time is needed for primary cells to assure optimal shearing.\nAdd 125 mM glycine (57 µL of 1.25 M glycine) to stop the fixation and incubate for another 5 min. Put the cells on ice immediately thereafter and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant by aspiration.",
    "Wash the cells twice with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant every time by aspiration.\n\tNOTE: After the fixation, the protocol can be paused. Fixed cells should be stored at -80 °C. To test, if the epitope of the antibody intended to use in the following protocol is not masked via fixation, additional samples can be used for analysis via SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and Western blot. These steps are performed with 100 µg of protein according to manufacturer's instructions. All αNFAT2 antibodies are used at a dilution of 1:1000, the GAPDH antibody at a dilution of 1:10000. An exemplary image of fixed samples from Jurkat cells with appropriate and inappropriate antibodies is shown in Figure 2.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of commercially available lysis buffer 1 by pipetting up and down. Then, place the samples on the ice on a shaker and incubate them for 10 min while shaking.\n\tNOTE: Prior to lysis, the cells can be disintegrated for 10 s in liquid nitrogen. This is useful for Jurkat cells but should be avoided in primary patient samples. For the disintegration, place the 5 mL tubes for 5 s in 5-10 mL of liquid nitrogen in a specific container. Wear safety glasses and appropriate safety gloves.\nSubsequently, centrifuge the tubes at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant carefully by pipetting.\nHomogenize the cells in 5 mL of commercially available lysis buffer 2 by pipetting up and down and incubate for 10 min on ice while shaking. Then centrifuge the tubes at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant carefully by pipetting.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL (Jurkat cells) or 140 µL (patient samples) of shearing buffer 1 containing 1x protease inhibitor (5 µL or 1.4 µL, respectively) and incubate the mixture for 10 min on ice.\nFor chromatin shearing, transfer 140 µL of the cell-suspension from step 3.9 into sonicator tubes (avoid producing air bubbles and repeat this step if necessary due to sample volume). Place the tubes in the focused ultra-sonicator at a temperature of 7 °C and shear for 10 min (cell line) or 7.5 min (patient samples) with an average incident power of 9.375 W to obtain 200-500 bp DNA fragments.\nFinally, centrifuge at 15700 x g for 10 min at 4 °C in the small centrifuge and collect the supernatant in a new 1.5 mL tube.\nTo test for the appropriate fragment sizes, analyze 20 µL of the sheared chromatin via gel-electrophoresis in 1.5% TBE agarose gel. An exemplary image of sheared chromatin from Jurkat cells of good and bad quality is shown in Figure 3. At this point, the protocol can be potentially paused. Sheared chromatin should be stored at -80 °C.\n4. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation\nNOTE: The chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with a commercially available ChIP kit according to the manufacturer's instructions with modifications7.",
    "Calculate the number of immunoprecipitations (70 µL (Jurkat cells) or 15 µL (patient samples) of sheared chromatin plus one antibody) and prepare 20 µL of protein A coated beads per precipitation in a 1.5 mL tube. Wash the beads in 40 µL of 1x ChIP buffer 1 per precipitation by pipetting up and down, let the beads rest in a magnetic rack for 1 min and remove the supernatant by pipetting. Perform this step four times in total. Eventually, resuspend the beads in the original volume with 1x ChIP buffer 1.\nFor the immunoprecipitation itself, use 10 µg of the αNFAT2 antibody (7A6) to capture NFAT2 with its bound target sequences. Use 2.5 µg of a rabbit IgG antibody (DA1E) as an IgG-control. Prepare the reactions in fresh 1.5 mL tubes as indicated in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: It is important to use a monoclonal antibody with high affinity whose epitope is not masked during fixation for this protocol. Polyclonal antibodies introduce an additional level of variation making it significantly more difficult to appropriately interpret the received results.\nIncubate the mixture from step 4.2 overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel at 6 rpm.\nOn the next day spin the tubes for 5 s at 7,000 x g in the small centrifuge, incubate them in a magnetic rack for 1 min and remove the supernatant by aspiration. Wash the beads once with each of the wash buffers 1, 2, 3 and 4 consecutively.\nTo do so, resuspend the beads in 350 µL of wash buffer and incubate them for 5 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel at 6 rpm.",
    "Thereafter, spin the tubes for 5 s at 7000 x g in the small centrifuge. Then, place them for 1 min in a magnetic rack, remove the supernatant and add the next wash buffer.\nAfter the last washing step, remove the supernatant by pipetting, take up the beads in 100 µL of elution buffer 1 and incubate them for 30 min on a rotating wheel at 6 rpm.\nSpin the tubes shortly (5 s at 7000 x g in the small centrifuge) and place them in a magnetic rack for 1 min.\nThen transfer the supernatant by pipetting to a new 1.5 mL tube and add 4 µL of elution buffer 2.\nTo create the input control, mix 1 µL of the sheared chromatin with 99 µL of elution buffer 1 and 4 µL of elution buffer 2 (in this setup, there are three tubes per patient: one input control, one IgG-control and one αNFAT2 sample).\nIncubate the samples for 4 h at 65 °C and 1300 rpm in a 1.5 mL tube shaker. Add 100 µL of 100% isopropanol, vortex and spin the samples for 5 s at 7000 x g in the small centrifuge.\nResuspend the available magnetic beads by thoroughly vortexing, add 10 µL of the beads to every sample and incubate for 1 h at room temperature on a rotating wheel at 6 rpm.\nAfter the incubation, spin the tubes for 5 s at 7000 x g in the small centrifuge and place them for 1 min in a magnetic rack. Remove the supernatant by aspiration.\nResuspend the beads in 100 µL of wash buffer 1. Invert the tubes to mix and incubate for 5 min at room temperature on a rotating wheel at 6 rpm.",
    "Spin the tubes for 5 s at 7000 x g in the small centrifuge, place them for 1 min in a magnetic rack and remove the supernatant by pipetting. Repeat the steps 4.13-4.14 with wash buffer 2.\nSubsequently, remove the wash buffer by aspiration, resuspend the beads in 55 µL of elution buffer and incubate for 15 min at room temperature on the rotating wheel at 6 rpm to elute the precipitated DNA. Finally, spin the tubes for 5 s at 7000 x g in the small centrifuge, place them for 1 min in a magnetic rack and transfer the supernatant into new 1.5 mL tubes.\n\tNOTE: Here the protocol can be potentially paused. The eluted DNA should then be stored at -20 °C.\n5. Detection of NFAT target genes in CLL cells.\nConduct the qRT-PCR reaction in duplicate for every sample as indicated in Table 2.\n\tNOTE: For the detection of target genes a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is conducted using a commercially available qRT-PCR Mix with a Real-time PCR instrument.\nUse white 96-well reaction plates for the reactions and the RT-PCR instrument. The cycling conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, [95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 30 s] x 40 cycles.\n\tNOTE: A serial dilution of the input (undiluted or diluted 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000 in nuclease-free water) is used to calculate the relative enrichment. In Jurkat cells, IL-2 was used as a positive control32. CD40L, a well-known target of NFAT2 in B cells, was used as a positive control in CLL cells and LCK as an example for a novel target gene of NFAT2 in CLL33,34. The primers for the CD40L, the IL-2 and LCK promoter region are described in the table of specific reagents and equipment.\n6. Normalization and Data Analysis",
    "NOTE: Relative enrichment for the promoter regions of interest (IL-2, CD40L or LCK) is calculated using the IgG-control for normalization.\nFirst, determine Ct (threshold cycle) values for the input serial dilution, the IL-2, CD40L and the LCK promoter region via the evaluation software from qRT-PCR data.\nDefine a standard curve for the concentrations via the serial dilution of the input. With this standard curve calculate the concentration for the IL-2, CD40L and the LCK promoter region for each duplicate of every sample.\nNext, calculate the mean of the duplicates. Then, set the IgG immunoprecipitation sample as a reference. Define the relative enrichment for this sample as 1.0 and compare the other sample (from the NFAT2 immunoprecipitation) to this reference.\nFinally, calculate the relative enrichment by dividing the concentration of the samples by the concentration of the IgG reference.\nSubscription Required.
