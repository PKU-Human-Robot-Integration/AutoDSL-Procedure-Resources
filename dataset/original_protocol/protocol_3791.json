    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of the affinity matrix (day 1)\nTiming: 2–2.5 h\nNote: This protocol is modified from previous publication (Heiman et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nThaw Biotin-Protein L and anti-GFP antibodies on ice.\nResuspend the Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 thoroughly in the original bottle by gentle pipette mixing. The magnetic beads are iron colored (reddish-brown); when the beads are dispersed, the solution become opaque. When the beads are collected on a magnet, the solution becomes clear.\nCalculate the required beads amount of based on the ratios below. Each biological replicate (ARC or PMv punches from 3 mice) requires: 250 μL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1, 100 μL Biotin-Protein L (1 μg/μL in 1✕ PBS), and 50 μg of each GFP antibody, 19C8 and 19F7.\nTo wash the magnetic beads, transfer the required bead volume to a 1.5 mL tube and place it on a magnetic tube holder. After 30 s, the beads will bind to the magnet and the solution will clear. Remove the supernatant.\nAdd 1✕ PBS (1 mL/1.5 mL tube) to the tube(s) and invert several times.\nPlace the tube(s) on magnetic holder, wait 30 s for the solution to clear and remove supernatant. If necessary, perform a quick spin to collect drops from the wall and lid of the tube(s). Repeat the procedure twice (three washes total).\nConjugate Biotin-Protein L to the Streptavidin MyOne T1 Dynabeads. Resuspend the washed beads in an appropriate volume of 1✕ PBS (original bead volume minus volume of Biotin-Protein L to be added) and 100 μL Biotin-Protein L per purification. For example: For an original bead volume of 250 μL, add 100 μL Biotinylated Protein L (1 μg/μL in 1✕ PBS) + 150 μL of 1✕ PBS.",
    "Incubate the beads for 35 min at 18°C to 25°C (room temperature) with gentle end-over-end rotation in a tube rotator.\nAfter 35 min, place the tube(s) back on the magnet holder, wait 30 s for the solution to clear and remove supernatant.\nBlock the magnetic beads. Wash beads 5 times with 1 volume of 1✕ PBS containing 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (IgG-Free, Protease-Free) (1 mL if in a 1.5 mL tube).\nAfter the last wash, place the tube(s) back on the magnetic holder, wait for 30 s for the solution to clear, remove supernatant, and proceed to antibody binding in Low Salt Wash Buffer.\nConjugate the anti-GFP to the beads via Biotin-Protein L. Add 50 μg each of anti-GFP antibodies 19C8 and 19F7 (100 μg total) in 1 mL final volume of Low Salt Wash Buffer and incubate at room temperature for 1 h using gentle end-over-end rotation in a tube rotator.\nWash the antibody conjugated beads 3 times with Low Salt Wash Buffer (1 mL for all washes if in a 1.5 mL tube). After the last wash, resuspend the beads in a volume of Low Salt Buffer such that each purification will receive an aliquot of the listed components ̶ beads/Biotin-Protein L/Ab (the affinity matrix in ratios described above) ̶ in a 250 μL final aliquot volume.\nNote: After antibody conjugation to the Streptavidin magnetic beads, combine aliquots and then dispense from a common source. The rationale is to have a consistent affinity matrix across all samples and to remove variability.",
    "Note: Once prepared, the affinity matrix can be used immediately, or can be stored for up to two weeks at 4°C with the addition of sodium azide to final concentration of 0.02%. If using pre-prepared affinity matrix stored in sodium azide, wash three times in Low Salt Buffer before use.\nMicropunch sampling of PMv and Arc (day 1)\nTiming: ~10 min\nAdd the following to 10 mL Tissue Lysis Buffer on ice.\n1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors\n10 μL 100 mg/mL CHX (Final: 100 μg/mL)\n5 μL 100 mM DTT (Final: 0.5 mM)\nEach biological replicate requires 500 μL of Tissue Lysis Buffer containing CHX, DTT, protease inhibitors and the adequate RNAse inhibitor described below.\n6.25 μL/mL of RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (40 U/μL)\n6.25 μL/mL of SUPERase•In RNase Inhibitor (20 U/μL)\n12.5 μL/mL of Protector RNase Inhibitor (40 U/μL)\nAdd 500 μL Tissue Lysis Buffer in a 1.5 mL tube on ice and place aside.\nAdd 10 μL 100 mg/mL CHX to 10 mL Dissection buffer on ice and set aside. Place two 3.5 cm round cell culture dishes (one for Arc and one for PMv) on ice and set aside.\nClean the mouse brain matrix, and the stage of stereo microscope with 70% ethanol and/or with RNase ZAP to decrease RNAase contamination.\nFill a styrofoam or plastic box with ice. Then insert the mouse brain matrix into the ice keeping only the working area outside the ice.\nTo aid in visualizing the tissue we found it helpful to place one or two freezing ice bag (s) on top of the bench and cover with a black background to improve visual contrast with the brain slices.\nClean the black background with 70% ethanol and/or RNase ZAP.",
    "Depending on institutional guidelines and animal protocol you may be required to anesthetize the mouse before euthanasia. We lightly anesthetized adult 10 weeks old female mice with isoflurane and then euthanized by decapitation. The brain was then quickly removed taking care to preserve the Arc and median eminence.\nImmediately insert the brain into the matrix with cortex side down (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/711-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Micropunch sampling of the mouse arcuate and ventral premammillary nuclei (Arc and PMv, respectively)\n(A) Brains were inserted into the matrix with hypothalamus facing up immediately after harvesting.\n(B) Once the brain is in position, chilled razor blades were placed along the extension of the hypothalamus.\n(C) The PMv and Arc were collected separately from the left and right sides of each individual mouse brain by micropunches. Scale bar: 2 mm.\nAdjust the brain’s position in the matrix with cold forceps so that the sagittal sinus and transverse sinus line up with the perpendicular grooves of the block.\nOnce the brain is in position, place a chilled razor blade through the optic chiasm and another chilled blade through the caudal end of the hypothalamus (caudal to the mammillary bodies). This will help to hold the brain in place.\nContinue to add a chilled blade at 1 mm interval at the level of interest (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nOnce the two blades are in place, press them down to the bottom of the slots with your fingers.\nGrasp each side of the two blades and move out of the matrix by rocking back and forth.\nOnce the blades are out of the slots, separate them gently and transfer the section to a pre-chilled cell culture dish placed on top of the black background using chilled forceps.",
    "To remove blood and other debris, quickly rinse the brain slice with approximately 500 μL ice-cold dissection buffer (containing CHX and DTT).\nHarvest the Arc (one punch in the midline, 1–1.25 mm diameter) and, in another section, the PMv (bilateral, one punch in each side, 1–1.25 mm diameter) with the help of a stereo microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nOnce harvested, immediately place the micropunch from each brain region into an ice pre-chilled tube with 500 μL Tissue Lysis Buffer.\nRepeat the steps to harvest more Arc and PMv micropunches from two additional mice and pool them together as one biological replicate. It takes about 3 min to collect both PMv (two punches) and Arc (one punch) from one mouse, or about 10 min for all three mice. Because we had three groups, we made the micropunches in three mice from each group (~30 min total) before processing the tissue for TRAP. This strategy resulted in RNA Integrity Number (RIN) = 10 for most of the samples, meaning the degradation of RNA was minimal.\nCritical: For optimal polysome integrity and high RNA yields, perform TRAP purification immediately with fresh tissue, as approximately half of the monosomes and the polysome aggregates are lost after flash freezing of tissue in liquid nitrogen, storage at −80°C and thawing (Heiman et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). If not possible, due to the requirement of large numbers of transgenic animals or different time-points following treatments, the isolated micropunches can be stored at −80°C after flash freezing in liquid nitrogen.\nCritical: To avoid experimental artifacts, all samples in an experiment should be processed in the same way (fresh or frozen).\nNote: Both the dissection buffer and the lysis buffer contain CHX. Follow your institutions’ guidelines for disposing of solutions (and/or solids) contaminated with CHX.\nTranslating ribosome isolation (day 1)",
    "Timing: ~40 min\nNote: RNA fraction definitions: Input RNA = RNA isolated from tissue lysates before S2 centrifugation (this will contain RNA from all the cells in the punch). Depleted/Cleared RNA = RNA isolated from non-GFP-labeled polysomes. Enriched RNA = RNA isolated from the GFP-labeled polysomes bound to the immunoprecipitation matrix.\nSet centrifuge to 4°C; refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for a flow chart.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/711-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. TRAP flow chart\nSummary of the protocol for TRAP organized in individual steps for concision and clarity.\nCombine the micropunches from one biological replicate together (i.e., six micropunches for the PMv and three for the Arc). Homogenize the pooled PMv or Arc punches in 500 μL (or more if needed) of Tissue Lysis Buffer with a single use pestles and a small, motorized homogenizer.\nCritical: Keep the homogenates ice cold; pre-chill pestle with Tissue Lysis Buffer (+protease and RNase inhibitors) and make sure the pestle does not rise above the level of the solution to avoid bubbles\nBring the final homogenate volume to 800 μL by adding 300 μL of ice-cold Tissue Lysis Buffer (with protease and RNase inhibitors). If desired, save an aliquot (50–100 μL) of homogenate and store at −80°C for RNA extraction. This is the input total RNA fraction.\nPrepare the post nuclear supernatant (S2) by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min, 2,000 × g.\nNote: The S2 pellet is the nuclear fraction, which you can keep at −80°C for RNA or protein, if desired.\nNote: S2 indicates the pellet post 2000 × g (S2) centrifugation.",
    "Transfer the S2 supernatant to a pre-chilled tube and add 1/9 sample volume of each 10% NP-40 (final concentration = 1%) and 300 mM DHPC (final concentration = 30 mM). Mix gently by hand inversion of tubes. For ~800 μL of supernatant this is 100 μL of each 10% NP-40 and 300 mM DHPC.\nIncubate on ice for 5 min.\nPellet the mitochondria by centrifugation at 4°C, 10 min, 20,000 × g (S20). The ribosomes and their associated RNAs remain in S20 supernatant.\nTransfer the S20 supernatant to a new pre-chilled tube on-ice and proceed immediately to translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP). The S20 supernatant can be stored on ice for several hours while additional samples are harvested before proceeding to TRAP.\nTranslating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) (day 1–2)\nTiming: ~18–20 h\nThoroughly resuspend the pre-prepared affinity matrix by gentle pipetting. If the affinity matrix was pre-prepared and stored with sodium azide, it should be washed 3 times in Low Salt Buffer before use. Follow your institutions guidelines for disposing of solutions contaminated with sodium azide; refer to Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. TRAP flow chart.\nAdd 200 μL affinity matrix to each sample (now at a volume of ~ 1 mL).\nCritical: Always resuspend the affinity matrix thoroughly by gentle pipetting immediately before use.\nIncubate at 4°C with gentle end-over-end mixing in a tube rotator overnight (16–18 h).\nPre-chill the magnet holder on ice (or overnight at 4°C).\nThe next day, prepare High Salt Buffer by adding CHX and DTT to 100 μg/mL and 0.5 mM final concentrations, respectively. Set aside on ice. You will need ~4 mL high salt buffer/biological replicate. Prepare enough volume for all samples (e.g., 5 biological replicates will need ~20 mL).",
    "Prepare the RNA isolation buffer. For QIAGEN RNeasy® Micro kit, add 10 μL β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME)/mL RNeasy RLT buffer. Set Aside.\nNote: If using another kit, follow manufacturer’s instructions.\nPrepare a set of microcentrifuge tubes to collect the post S20 lysate not associated with the anti-GFP coated beads.\nThe washing and collecting of the GFP-labeled ribosomes bound to the magnetic beads must be done either in a cold room or on ice. Collect the beads on a cold magnet holder. If necessary, use a mini centrifuge to spin down beads from caps in between washes.\nCritical: Save either an aliquot (100–200 μL) or the entire unbound fraction S20 lysate, this can be stored at −80°C to compare to enrichment of transcripts in purified material by downstream assays. RNA isolated from this fraction should be depleted (or cleared) of RNAs of your cell type of interest.\nAdd 1 mL of ice-cold High Salt Buffer and resuspend with gentle pipetting or 1–2 min end-over-end washing. After each wash, collect the beads with magnet and discard the supernatant.\nCritical: All washes should be performed by carefully pipetting to avoid the introduction of bubbles.\nRepeat High Salt Buffer wash 3 times (1 mL/wash for a total of 4 washes).\nAfter the last wash, remove wash buffer, remove the tube from the magnet and resuspend beads in 350 μL RLT with β-ME and then bring to room temperature (10 min) before processing (to avoid crystalizing the guanidine, or to redissolve the crystals).",
    "Place the tube back on the magnetic holder, wait for 30 s for the solution to clear. Remove the RNA (now in RNeasy RLT buffer) from the beads and place in a new collection tube. Proceed immediately to RNA clean-up following kit manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN RNeasy® Micro kit) or store at −80°C and process at a later date. RNA isolated from this fraction should be enriched for RNAs of your cell type of interest.\nCritical: Buffers from alternative RNA purification kits can be used, but the buffer used to release bound RNA from the beads must contain the denaturant guanidine thiocyanate. Guanidine thiocyanate can form crystals at low temperatures. Be sure to purify and clean up RNA at 18°C to 25°C (room temperature) to avoid crystallization.\nRNA cleanup and quantitation (day 3)\nTiming: 4–6 h\nProceed to RNA extraction follow the QIAGEN RNeasy® Micro Kit, or similar manufacturer’s instructions. Elute RNA in 30 μL RNase-free water. Purified RNA should be kept at −80°C for long-term storage. The RNeasy Micro Kit allows for elution of RNA in small volumes (as little as 10 μL). This is the cell specific or enriched ribosome-bound RNA.\nFor the depleted (or input) RNA, isolate RNA by adding 100–150 μL lysate to 350 μL RLT and following the protocol for RNA cleanup.\nTo assay the concentration and integrity of the RNA, analyze 1 μL of each sample on a Bioanalyzer 2100 using an RNA Pico/Nano chip (follow Agilent’s protocol for running chips). As RNA concentration in TRAP samples is likely to be low (<1 ng/μL), we do not recommend wasting RNA to nanodrop.\ncDNA synthesis and qPCR to screen for cell-type-specific RNA enrichment (day 3)\nTiming: 4–5 h",
    "As cell specific enhanced RNA concentrations are likely to be low, if necessary, reverse transcribe cDNA blind to concentration.\nReverse Transcribe 3–5 μL RNA of both enriched RNAs and depleted RNAs with the Reverse Transcriptase of your choice. We used Superscript II (Invitrogen) and the reaction was primed with both oligo dT and random hexamers (Burger et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Burger et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Han et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Ruka et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nWe also recommend creating a standard curve. This could be a dilution series of the RNA of interest, such as a pool created from either input or depleted RNA. We have shown previously that a range of 0.005 ng/μL to 5 ng/μL of hypothalamic RNA can be reverse transcribed and PCR amplified with high efficiency (Ruka et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nNote: Creating a standard curve provides an opportunity to determine the lower limit of RNA that can be both reverse transcribed and PCR amplified successfully from the tissue of interest. However, other options for determining PCR efficiency (e.g., dilution series of amplicon) are also acceptable.\ncDNA from the depleted and enriched RNAs were amplified for Lepr (cell specific transcript) and Tnf and Ccl3 (micro glial transcripts, potential glial contaminants), and β-actin (Actb; example of a housekeeping transcript) using Taqman qPCR technology (Han et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Lepr, Tnf3 and Ccl3 were normalized to Actb using normalized relative expression, comparative cycle threshold method (Bustin, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) and enrichment calculated as normalized relative expression in the enhanced RNA sample, divided by the normalized relative expression in the depleted sample. qPCR traces from TRAP enrichment from rare hypothalamic cell types can be found in previous publications (Burger et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Krashes et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).",
    "If desired, pre-amplification of remaining cDNA may facilitate examination of further transcripts of interest either by qPCR (Burger et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Ruka et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) or PCR array.\nNote: Once the technique is working it may be unnecessary to collect the input RNA."
