    "Cell growth Spread MT+ (CC-125) and MT- (CC-124) cells on TAP 1.5% agar medium using an inoculating loop (approximately two loop-full of cells spread over the whole surface).Incubate for 7–10 days in bright light (lid facing down, 22 °C, ~100 μmoles m-2·s-1) (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4705/bioprotoc-13-13-4705-g001.jpgFigure 1. Plates of Chlamydomonas CC-124 (MT-) and CC-125 (MT+) cells grown on TAP agar plate at harvesting time.  Two loop-full of cells were spread over the plate and grown under bright light (100 μmoles m-2·s-1) for seven days.Gametogenesis Start this step in the late afternoon (5:00–6:00 PM).For each plate, add 10 mL of TAP -N liquid medium to a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube (use one tube per plate).Using a cell scraper, transfer the cells from the agar to the liquid.Use a pipette to resuspend cell clumps as much as possible (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4705/bioprotoc-13-13-4705-g002.jpgFigure 2. Cell suspension after transfer from TAP agar plates to TAP -N liquid medium. Cells were scraped from plate and resuspended in liquid medium (here, MT- CC-124 on the left and MT+ CC-125 on the right). Pipetting is used to break cell clumps as much as possible.Leave horizontally in bright light (~100 μmoles m-2·s-1) overnight without shaking.Mating and autolysin production In the morning, transfer 10 μL of cells to a microscope slide and check for motility.Note: Over 50% of cells should be moving actively. Mix the MT+ and MT- strains in the 50 mL centrifuge tubes and incubate for 2 h in the dark without shaking.Centrifuge at 3,000× g for 5 min.Transfer supernatant to a clean glass beaker and discard the tube containing the pellet.Filter the supernatant into a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube using a 50 mL syringe and a 0.45 μm PES filter.",
    "Set aside 2 mL of filtered supernatant for Section D and place the rest to freeze immediately in a -80 °C freezer.Testing autolysin preparation efficiency Four days prior to autolysin production, inoculate CC-125 (cell walled) and CC-503 (cell wall–less) strains in 5 mL of TAP liquid medium in a 50 mL conical tube. Note: Any cell wall–less strain (cw15 or cw92 mutant) can be used as a control for lysis. After detergent treatment (step D10), it should show a white pellet and a green supernatant. CC-5325/CC-4533, which is annotated cw15, synthesizes a cell wall and should not be used for that purpose (Zhang et al., 2022).  Harvest the 5 mL of late log CC-125 and CC-503 cells and adjust each OD750nm to 0.3 with fresh TAP -N medium.To evaluate lysis efficiency by chlorophyll absorbance, transfer 1 mL to a cuvette and measure OD662nm of the initial cell suspensions (OD1, zero with TAP -N medium).Centrifuge 4 × 1 mL of CC-125 and 2 × 1 mL of CC-503 at 1,500× g for 5 min in 1.7 mL centrifuge tubes.Discard the supernatants.Resuspend the two pellets of CC-503 in 1 mL each of TAP -N (positive control), two pellets of CC-125 in 1 mL each of TAP -N liquid medium (negative control), and the two other CC-125 pellets in 1 mL each of the autolysin preparation supernatant set aside in step C6. We now have six tubes for three conditions: cell wall–less CC-503, cell-walled CC-125 in TAP -N, and cell-walled CC-125 treated with the prepared autolysin.Incubate horizontally for 45 min in bright light (~100 μmoles m-2·s-1) without shaking.Centrifuge all the tubes at 1,500× g for 5 min.Discard the supernatants.For each condition, resuspend tube 1 in 1 mL of water and tube 2 in 1 mL of 0.1% Triton X-100.Vortex for 2 min.",
    "Centrifuge at 1,500× g for 5 min.Autolysin efficiency can be quickly assessed from the color of the pellets and supernatants (Figure 3). After Triton X-100 treatment, the supernatant in the CC-125 cells treated with efficient autolysin is green, and we can proceed with the quantification of lysis efficiency. If it is still translucent, the autolysin preparation failed, and all tubes should be discarded.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4705/bioprotoc-13-13-4705-g003.jpgFigure 3. Expected results from autolysin and detergent treatment. Cells incubated with the prepared autolysin or in control conditions were treated with the detergent Triton X-100 to induce cell lysis. Cell wall–less cells (CC-503) display a green supernatant showing cell lysis and release of chlorophyll, while the pellet becomes white (B). Cell-walled cells (CC-125) incubated in control conditions are resistant to the detergent and the cell pellet stays green (D). Cells treated with good autolysin undergo at least partial lysis and display a green supernatant (F).Transfer the supernatant to a cuvette and measure OD662nm (OD2, zero with 0.1% Triton X-100).Calculate gross efficiency by the ratio between the OD662nm after (OD2) and before (OD1) detergent treatment:Efficiency (%) = OD2662nm/OD1662nm Using the autolysin preparation Thaw the frozen autolysin in a beaker filled with water at room temperature for ~1 h.Note: We recommend using the freshest preparation possible. Avoid using autolysin stored for more than two months, as it will significantly lose activity over time. Centrifuge cells to transform at 1,500× g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in autolysin solution at ~5 × 106 cells/mL.Incubate in bright light (~100 μmoles m-2·s-1) without shaking for 45 min.Centrifuge at 1,500× g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 25 mL of TAP sucrose 40 mM.Centrifuge at 1,500× g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant.Proceed with the transformation protocol."
