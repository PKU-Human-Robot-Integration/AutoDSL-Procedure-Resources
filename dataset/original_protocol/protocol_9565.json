    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials, reagents, and equipment used in this protocol.\n1. Fabrication of CF-PCR microfluidic chip\nHeat the silicon wafer at 200 °C for 25 min to remove the moisture.\nDispense 1 mL of SU-8-2075 photoresist per inch of the wafer. Spin it on the silicon wafer using a spin coater at 500 rpm for 5-10 s with an acceleration of 100 rpm/s, and then at 2,000 rpm for 30 s with an acceleration of 500 rpm/s.\nSoft bake the silicon wafer at 65 °C for 3 min, then at 95 °C for 15 min.\nSet 150 - 215 mJ/cm² as the exposure energy for the photolithography machine, and engrave the designed pattern onto the photoresist with a photolithography mask. Place the silicon wafer and the mask ready for exposure.\nPost exposure, bake the silicon wafer at 65 °C for 2 min, and then at 95 °C for 7 min.\nImmerse the silicon wafer in developer solution to remove excess photoresist and take it out when the microchannels can be seen (Figure 1). Use isopropanol to rinse off the residual developer solution.\nMix the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer and curing agent at a ratio of 10:1. Pour the mixed PDMS solution into the replica mold and solidify it at 80 °C for 60 min.\nBond the PDMS microfluidic chip on a slide after activation using a plasma cleaner, and solidify them at 80 °C for 30 min as soon as possible (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The outer dimensions of the chip are 80.0 mm × 30.0 mm × 0.4 mm. There are 40 serpentine channels (100 µm × 1.46 mm × 100 µm, width × length × depth) in the microfluidic chip.\n2. Preparation of the PCR solution",
    "Thaw the reagents completely before configuration. Use a vortex mixer and centrifuge to ensure the reagents are well mixed.\nPrepare a centrifuge tube, adding the following components in this order: 33.75 µL of water, 1.0 µL of DNA template, 0.5 µL of primer, 5.0 µL of buffer, 4.0 µL of dNTP mixture, 1.5 µL of Tween 20, 3.5 µL of PVP, and finally 0.25 µL of DNA polymerase.\n\tNOTE: Here, the DNA template used is E. coli. The primers for E. coli and the components of the PCR solution are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.\nMix the solution by vortexing.\n3. Construction of the CF-PCR system\nPrepare two positive temperature coefficient (PTC) ceramic heaters, two solid-state relays, two PID temperature controllers, two temperature sensors, and a power cord.\n\tNOTE: The size of the PTC ceramic heaters depends on the size of the microfluidic chip; the length should be greater than the length of the chip-the length-width-height of the PTC ceramic heaters used here is 10 cm x 2 cm x 0.4 cm.\nConnect the heater to the solid-state relay.\nConnect the solid-state relay to the PID temperature controller.\nAttach the temperature sensor probe to the bottom of the two heaters and connect the terminal to the PID temperature controller.\nConnect two solid-state relays in series and connect the power cord.\n3D print a slot for the two heaters and keep the heaters on the same plane (see Supplemental File 1 for STL files required for 3D printing).\n\tNOTE: Leave a 12 mm air gap between the two heaters.\nPlace the microfluidic chip on the two heaters.",
    "Prepare a syringe pump and a syringe, fix the syringe on the syringe pump, connect a silicone tubing (0.8 mm inner diameter [ID]) with a syringe, and connect a steel needle (0.7 mm ID) to the top of the silicone tubing (Figure 3).\nInsert the steel needle into the inlet of the microfluidic chip.\nPlace a pipette tip at the outlet of the chip to collect the PCR products.\n4. Construction of the CE system\nUse a high-voltage power supply to generate a pulsed-field electric field; note the positive and negative electrodes.\nUse a mercury lamp as the light source and filter the excitation wavelength from the mercury lamp through a filter.\nPlace the capillary on the microscope stage.\nCollect the fluorescence emission with the objective, and then detect it using an R928 photomultiplier tube (PMT). Observe the microscope and the capillary. Turn on the light under dark room conditions; excitation light is collected by the objective.\nUse the self-developed LABVIEW software to control the power supply and complete the data acquisition (described in steps 6.3-6.6). See https://github.com/starliyan/labview/blob/main/CZE20170723.vi.\n\t​NOTE: All experiments were performed in a dark room, and the schematic of the CE system is shown in Figure 4.\n5. Run the PCR solution\nPreset the temperature of the heaters of the CF-PCR system at 65 °C and 95 °C.\nPlace the microfluidic chip on the two heating blocks.\nInsert the tip of the silicone tube into a centrifuge tube containing 50 µL of the PCR solution (from step 2.3). Pull the syringe plunger to slowly withdraw the solution. Fix the syringe on a syringe pump. Insert the steel needle into the inlet of the microfluidic chip.",
    "Set the flow rate of the pump to 10 µL/min and press the start button to push the solution in the microchannel at the inlet of the microchip.\nCollect the PCR products at the outlet of the microfluidic chip.\n\t​NOTE: Rinse the channel with ultrapure water before and after the PCR to remove impurities.\n6. Detection of the PCR products by this CE system built in-house\nPrepare a capillary with an 8 cm total length and a 6 cm effective length.\nPrepare the separation buffer by mixing 100 µL of 1% hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC, w/v), 2 µL of 100x SYBR Green I, and 98 µL of ultrapure water to obtain 0.5% HEC (w/v) containing 1x SYBR Green I.\nFill the capillary with the prepared separation buffer using a vacuum pump.\nInput the injection voltage (800 V) and the injection time (2.0 s) on the software interface, click the start button, and wait for the PCR products to be electrodynamically introduced into the capillary at 100 V/cm (2.0 s).\n\tNOTE: In this step, the PCR products are placed on the negative electrode and the buffer is placed on the positive electrode.\nInput the DC voltage (800 V) on the software interface, click the start button, and run the electrophoresis at 100 V/cm of electric field strength.\n\tNOTE: In this step, both the positive and negative electrodes are placed with buffer.\nClick the stop button after all DNA fragments are separated in the capillary.\nFlush the capillary with sterilized water for 1 min after each run.\nSubscription Required.
