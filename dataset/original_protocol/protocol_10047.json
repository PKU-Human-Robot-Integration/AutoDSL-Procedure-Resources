    "All the methodologies described were approved by the i3S Animal Ethics Committee and Direção Geral de Veterinária (DGAV) and are in accordance with the European Parliament Directive 2010/63/EU.\n1. Preparation of the decellularization solutions\nNOTE: All decellularization solutions should be filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter and stored for a maximum of 3 months, except specified otherwise.\nFor 1x PBS: Mix 8 g of NaCl, 1.01 g of Na2HPO4 200 mg of KCl, and 200 mg of KH2PO4 with 900 mL of deionized water (DI water). Adjust solution pH to 7.5 and the final solution volume up to 1 L. Filter, autoclave, and store the solution at room temperature (RT).\nFor Hypotonic Buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.1% EDTA): Dissolve 1.21 g of TrisBASE and 1 g of EDTA in 900 mL of deionized water. Adjust solution pH to 7.8 with NaOH/HCl and the final solution volume to 1 L. Filter, sterilize by autoclave, and store at RT.\nFor 0.2% SDS solution (0.2% SDS, 10 mM Tris): Add 0.6 g of TrisBASE and 1 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in 400 mL of DI water and stir at 60 °C until complete solute dissolution. Let solution to cool down to RT. Adjust solution pH to 7.8 and the final solution volume to 500 mL. Sterilize solution by filtration.\n\tNOTE: The SDS solution should be prepared prior to use. Filter solution only after complete SDS dissolution, otherwise the SDS insoluble particles will saturate the filter, changing the final SDS concentration and consequently affecting tissue decellularization efficiency.\nFor Hypotonic Wash Buffer (10 mM Tris): Mix 1.21 g of TrisBASE in 900 mL of DI water. Adjust solution pH to 7.8 and the final volume to 1 L. Filter, sterilize by autoclave and store at RT.",
    "For DNase treatment (20 mM Tris, 2 mM MgCl2, 50 U/mL DNase): Dissolve 2.42 g of TrisBASE and 2 mL of 1 M MgCl2 in 900 mL of DI water. Adjust pH to 7.8 and the final solution volume to 1 L. Filter and sterilize solution by autoclave. Store solution at RT. Add DNase I (50 U/mL) prior to use.\nFor DNase I stock solution: Prepare a DNase buffer containing 50% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, and adjust to a final solution volume of 10 mL with DI water. In a laminar flow hood, add the DNase I powder to the DNase buffer and mix gently until complete dissolution. Sterilize solution through 0.22 μm filter. Prepare 1 mL aliquots and store at -20 °C.\n2. Tissue harvesting and cryopreservation\nEuthanize adult pregnant females at 18 days of gestation (E18 fetuses) via CO2 asphyxiation. Perform a cesarean section on the females with a surgical scissor and collect the uterine horns bearing the fetal mice to a Petri dish with ice-cold 1x PBS using two serrated tweezers with curved tips (one tweezer to each horn end).\n\t\nOpen the uterine horns and amniotic sac to isolate the fetuses. Transfer the fetuses to a new Petri dish with ice-cold 1x PBS to anesthetize them and decapitate with a scissor.\nEuthanize 7-8 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice using CO2 asphyxiation. Perform an incision on each mouse chest and collect the heart.\nBriefly rinse fetal and adult hearts with ice cold 1x PBS.",
    "Remove the atria of adult heart with the help of a scalpel. Perform an incision on the right ventricle and remove it using straight small scissors. Expose the left ventricle inner wall by removing the septum. In a new Petri dish, divide the left ventricle free-wall in longitudinal strips with 2 mm thickness and remove the papillary muscle using a scalpel and serrated tweezers with curved tips.\n\t\nExcise small tissue explants with the help of a scalpel using a 2 mm x 2 mm grid (Detailed description in supplementary Figure 15). Briefly rinse tissue explants with 1x PBS.\nAdd ~250 µL of the optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound to autoclaved 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Transfer whole fetal hearts and adult cardiac explants to the tubes with 250 µL of OCT and freeze them with dry ice-cooled isopentane and store at -80 °C (to a maximum of 6 months).\n\tNOTE: The use of cardiac tissue explants cryopreserved for more than 6 months will significantly reduce the decellularization efficiency, especially in the adult heart tissue explants.\n3. Tissue decellularization",
    "NOTE: Cardiac tissue decellularization is performed in a 24-well tissue culture plate with one sample per well. 1 mL of each decellularization solution is added to each individual well. All decellularization steps should be performed with agitation at 165 rpm (incubator shaker with an orbital diameter of 20 mm) and at 25 °C, unless specified otherwise. For more details, please consult the scheme on Figure 1A. Amphotericin B (e.g. fungizone) and gentamicin are freshly added to all decellularization solutions before use to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/mL and 0.01 μg/mL, respectively. To quantify the amount of DNA retained within decellularized tissues, the sample mass needs to be determined before starting the decellularization protocol. The DNA quantification protocol is further detailed in section 5.1.\nDAY 1\nRemove tissue samples from the -80 °C freezer. Leave the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes at RT until OCT becomes partially melted. Transfer the cardiac tissue block of the still frozen OCT to a Petri dish with 1x PBS.\nAfter the OCT melts, move the cardiac tissue to a new Petri dish with 1x PBS. Wash samples in 1x PBS and at 60 rpm with a shaker for 10-15 min. Repeat at least twice.\nAdd 1 mL of working Hypotonic Buffer per well of a sterile 24-well tissue culture plate.Transfer one sample per well with the help of forceps.\nMove the 24-well tissue culture plate with the samples to an incubator shaker at 25 °C and start the 18 h incubation with Hypotonic Buffer.\nDAY 2\nPrepare the 0.2% SDS solution as described in section 1.3.\nAspirate the Hypotonic Buffer and wash the samples with 1x PBS for 1 h. Repeat 3 times.\n\t\tNOTE: PAUSE POINT: Tissue under decellularization can be kept in 1x PBS at 4 °C for 18 h in static conditions.",
    "Remove the 1x PBS, add 1 mL of freshly made SDS solution (step 1.3) per well and incubate samples for 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: (CHECK POINT) Post SDS incubation, ensure that samples exhibit a white to translucent appearance. At this step, SDS treated samples are drenched in DNA, showing a gelatin-like consistency. Remove SDS solution slowly to avoid sample adhesion to the pipette tip.\nDAY 3\nWash the samples with Hypotonic Wash Buffer (1 mL per well) for 20 min. Repeat 3 times.\n\t\tNOTE: At this step, it is normal to observe a decrease in the sample size due to the removal of cell remnants. PAUSE POINT: Tissue under decellularization can be kept in Hypotonic Wash Buffer at 4 °C for 18 h in static conditions.\nAdd 1 mL of DNase Treatment solution per well and incubate the samples for 3 h at 37 °C.\nAspirate the DNase Treatment solution and wash the samples with 1x PBS (1 mL per well) for 20 min. Repeat 3 times. Perform a final wash with 1x PBS (1 mL per well) overnight at RT and shaking at 60 rpm.\n(Check point) After DNase treatment, ensure that the decellularized samples have lost the gelatin-like consistency.\n\t\tNOTE: After DNase treatment, remove and add 1x PBS gently since samples can be easily entrapped and attached to the pipette tip.\n4. Assessment of decellularized tissue cell removal\nFix the samples in a 24-well tissue culture plate, 1 sample per well, by adding 1 mL of freshly made 10% formalin neutral buffer with 0.03% aqueous eosin for 2.5-3 h at RT.",
    "NOTE: Eosin is added to the fixative to stain the decellularized tissue and to ease sample visualization during sectioning and histological staining. The addition of the eosin neither interferes with the histological stains nor with immunofluorescence techniques. Alternatively, the fixation can be performed overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove the fixative solution and add 1 mL of 1x PBS to wash the sample.\nEncapsulate the fixed bioscaffolds in histology processing gel using a disposable vinyl specimen mold according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nRemove the histology gel with the sample embedded from the mold and transfer to Biopsy Processing/Embedding Cassettes with Lid.\n\tNOTE: An alternative to tissue embedding in histology and processing gel is to process each sample in two biopsy sponges with small pores. The samples should be localized to the center of the biopsy sponges to enable detection. Of note, some samples can be difficult to localize using this approach.\nProcess the samples for paraffin embedding through successive incubations (30 min per solution) in series of alcohol concentrations (70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 100%), isoparaffinic aliphatic hydrocarbon solution (2 incubation stations) and paraffin (2 incubation stations) at 56 °C.\nMount the samples in a paraffin block.\nCut 3 μm-thick paraffin sections on a microtome and collect the sections on glass microscope slides.\nDry paraffin sections overnight at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: (PAUSE POINT) Paraffin sections are stored at 4 °C until further use.\nTo verify protocol efficiency, perform Hematoxilin and Eosin (H&E) and Masson's Trichrome staining (MT) of the decellularized sample sections and to sections of non-manipulated tissue according to manufacturer's instructions.",
    "NOTE: H&E staining stains cell nuclei blue/purple, cytoplasm dark pink/red and collagen pale pink and MT stains nuclei black, cytoplasm red, and collagen and mucin blue. Efficient decellularization is achieved when a porous light pink (H&E, MT) and blue (MT) network is observed, in the absence of a nuclear stain.\n5. Assessment of decellularized tissue nuclear material removal\nNOTE: The quantification of the DNA content on decellularized tissue must be performed in comparison to the respective non-manipulated tissue.\nBefore decellularization, weigh a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on a high precision digital scale. Transfer the cardiac tissue to the tube, remove the extra amount of 1x PBS and weigh the tube with the samples. Calculate the wet weight of the samples:\nSamplewet weight = weight tube with samples – weight empty tube\nDecellularize the samples as described in Step 3.\nAfter decellularization, collect the decellularized tissues into a microcentrifuge tube.\n\t\nDue to the small dimensions and mass of the individual cardiac samples and kit specifications, pool decellularized tissues of each sample condition (fetal heart: 5 whole hearts; adult LV explants: 15 explants). Perform the same procedure with the non-manipulated tissue.\n\t\tNOTE: (PAUSE POINT) The samples can be stored at -20 °C until DNA extraction and quantification are performed.\nCut the non-manipulated and decellularized tissues in small explants with a help of a scalpel in a clean Petri dish.\n\tNOTE: Use an individual scalpel and Petri dish for each sample. Mechanical disruption of the samples with a scalpel facilitates their posterior enzymatic digestion and subsequent DNA extraction.\nFor DNA extraction, use a spin-column based DNA extraction method according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\nCollect the mechanically dissociated samples from the Petri dish with the master digestion buffer (digestion buffer and proteinase K) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a wide orifice pipette tip.",
    "NOTE: Tissue lysis with Proteinase K digestion is faster in decellularized samples. To process distinct samples at the same time, keep lysed samples on ice, until all samples are lysed to minimize degradation. Complete samples lysis is achieved between 4-6 h.\nProceed with the protocol according the manufacturer instructions.\nTo increase the yields of extracted DNA of decellularized and non-decellularized tissue samples, elute the DNA on 25-50 μL and 100 μL of elution buffer, respectively. Collect the eluted DNA and load the spin-column. Incubate for 1 min at RT. Centrifuge the samples according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\tNOTE: (PAUSE POINT) The DNA extracted from the samples can be store at -20 °C until further use.\nQuantify the extracted DNA from the samples with a fluorescent dsDNA detection kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nNormalize the DNA content as nanograms of DNA per milligram of initial sample wet weight (before decellularization).\n6. Decellularized scaffolds cell seeding\nNOTE: All solutions/reagents need to be sterile and the entire procedure performed at sterile conditions.\nPrepare 1x DPBS with 2.5 μg/mL of amphotericin B and 1% P/S (penicillin, 100 I.U.; streptomycin 100 µg/mL).\nRemove the 1x PBS solution from the last decellularization washing step (step 3.3.3) and add 500 μL per well of the freshly prepared 1x DPBS/2.5 μg/mL of amphotericin B/1% P/S solution. Store samples at 4 °C from 1-7 days.\n\tNOTE: Samples storage at 4 °C is important to maintain sterility.\nAdd P/S to cell basal media (without FBS and supplements) to a final concentration of 1%.\nAspirate 1x DPBS/2.5 μg/mL of amphotericin B/1% P/S solution from the decellularized samples. Add 500 μL per well of cell basal media/1% P/S and let samples equilibrate for 1 h at 37 °C, or at 4 °C for more than 1 h.",
    "Split the cells of interest and prepare small aliquots of cells at the cell density desired.\n\tNOTE: The decellularized tissue seeding must be performed under a stereoscopic microscope and in sterile conditions. Cell culture media should contain 1% P/S.\nPipette 3-4 μL of DPBS to the center of a well of a 96-well plate. Using thin and straight tweezers, transfer the decellularized scaffolds to the DPBS drop, remove the extra DPBS by aspiration, and make sure that the sample is not folded or wrinkled. Let it become dry at the edges to adhere to the well surface.\n\tNOTE: Detached scaffolds have lower seeding efficiency.\nAdd cells to the scaffold by pipetting the single-cell solution slowly against the edges of the well.\n\tNOTE: For example, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes are seeded with at a density of 7,500 cells/mm2 and immortalized mouse Lin− Sca-1+ cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCSca-1) at a density of 60-1,500 cells/mm2. Adjust cell density according the experimental rationale.\nAdd DPBS to the neighboring wells to avoid fast media evaporation.\n24 hours post cell seeding, if the cell type used adhered to the tissue culture polystyrene plates (TCPS), transfer bioscaffolds to a new well. Otherwise, replace the medium to remove non-adherent cells.\nChange carefully the media according to specific requirements of the cell type.\nSubscription Required.
