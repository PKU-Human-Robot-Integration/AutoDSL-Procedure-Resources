    "1. Consent and Biomarker Identification\nThis protocol has been reviewed and approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central - Oxford A.\nIdentify appropriate subjects for study: subjects are those who are clinically identified as being suitable for deep brain stimulation (medically refractory Parkinson's disease). Note: Perform experiment after electrode implantation (day 1) and before battery/stimulator placement (day 7) whilst wires are externalized.\nConsent patient for stimulation testing and overnight Parkinsonian medication withdrawal.\nFollowing 12 hr withdrawal of Parkinsonian medication, connect externalized DBS electrodes to appropriate amplifier (amplifier must be designed, safety tested & validated for intracranial neurophysiological use in humans)16.\nRecord local field potential (LFP) at rest from all contacts bilaterally (L 0-3 & R 0-3.)\nCreate bipolar montages (0,2 and 1,3) by subtraction of recordings from adjacent contacts.\nPerform power spectral analysis to identify patient specific beta peak frequency and bipolar contact pair with highest beta amplitude for stimulation testing. Note: majority of PD patients off medication have a beta peak2. If no beta peak is discernible off medication, the patient should be excluded from further analysis as this may represent DBS targeting complications.\nSelect contact for monopolar stimulation that is bridged by bipolar contact pair (0,2 or 1,3) with highest beta amplitude.\n2. Connection of Patient to aDBS Setup\nConnect the DBS electrode to the analogue amplifier and filter. Note: band pass filter between 3 - 37 Hz with x 9,100 gain.\nConnect reference to patient. Note: Reference should be 5 cm x 5 cm neurostimulator gel electrode pad connected by a standard 2 mm monopolar electrode wire. Place the electrode over the left clavicle.",
    "Connect analogue amplifier to A/D converter and portable computer running signal analysis software. Second stage digitally filter the signal around the patient specific beta peak with a 4 Hz pass band. Monitor beta amplitude and use this to control stimulation with a pre-set threshold. Smooth beta amplitude with a smoothing window (400 msec was heuristically effective in this setup.)\nConnect D/A trigger to stimulator.\nConnect stimulator to patient through amplifier. Note: For safety, ensure charge densities are limited to <30 μQ/cm2 and stimulator has linear input - output function. Optically isolate all connections to patient. Stimulator should be designed and tested with EN60601-1 medical safety standard as reference.\n3. Testing of Conventional Continuous Stimulation\nTurn on conventional high frequency stimulation, but initially at zero voltage (100 msec, 130 Hz, 0 V). Apply monopolar stimulation at contact bridged by bipolar contact pair with highest beta amplitude. Monitor stimulator readout continuously throughout experiment to ensure that stimulation delivered is as expected.\nSlowly increase stimulation voltage by 0.5 V increments every few minutes, looking for clinical effect threshold. Establish clinically useful stimulation voltage (generally 1.5-3.0 V) accompanied by minimal or no side-effects such as paresthesia.\n4. Testing of Threshold with on/off Switching and Trigger Setting\nWith the stimulation at the clinically effective voltage, switch the stimulator off with 250 msec ramping down.\nWith the stimulation at the clinically effective voltage, switch the stimulator on with 250 msec ramping up.\nEnquire about paresthesia and any other possible side-effects experienced upon switching stimulation on and off.\nIf side effects are present, reduce the voltage by 0.25 V and repeat steps 4.1 to 4.3 until below paresthesia upon on/off switching threshold.",
    "By titration find the threshold for paresthesia with on/off switching again and set the voltage just below (0.1 V) this threshold for further testing. If this is clinically ineffective then try other contact (choose contact 1 or 2). Note: switching stimulator on and off may also in some patients cause a spike artifact, possibly related to capacitance charging at the tissue electrode interface. As the signal was pass-band filtered in the beta band, before setting a trigger level, this artifact was greatly attenuated. Nevertheless, in a few instances this artifact was sufficient to cause self-triggering. To address this in these cases, we reduced the voltage of stimulation, and increased trigger threshold to escape self-triggering. Another way that this could be tackled in the future if necessary is through the incorporation of a lock out period after each trigger onset to avoid self-triggering.\nTurn on stimulation at voltage just under the on/off switching paresthesia threshold determined above.\nIncrease beta amplitude trigger threshold to a level that results in the minimum time on stimulation whilst maintaining clinical effect. Aim for at least 50% reduction in time on stimulation.\nTurn off stimulation and leave patient without stimulation (following set up and between test blocks) for 10 min to washout stimulation effect.\n5. Testing of Patient Across Different Stimulation Conditions\nEnsure blinding of patients to test conditions (adaptive DBS, conventional & off).\nApply each test condition for a minimum of a 5 min stabilization period with the condition running before clinical testing begins. Counterbalance test condition order across subjects. Fix the voltage, pulse width and stimulation frequency identically across test conditions so that the only difference relates to the timing of stimulation with regard to beta amplitude.",
    "At a predetermined fixed point after commencement of stimulation (e.g., as a minimum 300 sec), assess the patient clinically for effect through the UPDRS rating scale.\nVideo record assessment and then blind rate by independent experts offline (excluding rigidity.)\nPerform clinical assessment using objective measures (accelerometry or actigraphy)."
