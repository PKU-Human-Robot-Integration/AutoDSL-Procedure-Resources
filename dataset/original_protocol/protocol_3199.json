    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPreparation of Lymphocyte Single-Cell Suspension\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes how to process the thymus and lymph nodes (LN) into single-cell suspensions that will be used for in vitro IL-2 stimulation and fluorescent antibody staining.\nPreparing the thymocyte suspension\nThe thymus is surgically removed from C57BL/6 mice and placed on gauze to remove blood and residual connective tissues using tweezers.\nThymus is placed into a 10 cm petri dish, and then gently disrupted and processed into small pieces (around 2–3 mm3) using tweezers.\nResuspend the thymus tissues with 10 mL harvest medium by pipetting up and down with a 10 mL pipette (more than 15 times) to generate a thymocyte suspension.\nCritical: Avoid generating air bubbles during the pipetting. Air bubbles result in increased cell death and loss of cells.\nFilter the cell suspension into 15 mL conical tubes by passing through 100 μm nylon filters and place the cells on ice until further use.\nLN dissection\nThe LNs are surgically removed and placed on gauze to remove residual connective tissues.\nPlace two frosted glass slides in 10 cm petri dish.\nAdd 10.5 mL harvest medium into the petri dish and wet the frosted sides of two glass slides.\nPut the LNs on one of frosted glass slide and press weakly while rubbing the glass slides in circular motions to rupture the LNs.\nResuspend the LN suspension by pipetting up and down more than 15 times using 10 mL pipettes to make a well-mixed cell suspension.\nCritical: Avoid generating air bubbles during the pipetting. Air bubbles cause increased cell death and loss of cells.\nFilter the cell suspension into 15 mL conical tubes through 100 μm nylon filters, and place the filtered cell suspension on ice until further use.",
    "Critical: Cell suspension should be kept on ice to ensure maximum cell viability.\nCounting of cell numbers\nAdd 10 μL single-cell suspension to 190 μL 0.08% trypan blue (1: 20 dilution).\nTake 10 μL of the cell suspension from step 3a and count cells using a hematocytometer.\nNote: We routinely use trypan blue and a hematocytometer to count the number of viable cells. If the viability is less than 80%, it is critical to use live/dead discrimination dyes prior to IL-2 stimulation to obtain accurate results.\nIn Vitro IL-2 Stimulation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes how to stimulate lymphocytes with recombinant IL-2 to trigger STAT5 phosphorylation. IL-2 stimulation and Foxp3 staining are performed in the same tube, and then split into two tubes for isotype control antibody staining and anti-phospho-STAT5 staining.\nLive/dead dye (Ghost dye Violet 510) staining (Troubleshooting 1)\nNote: If the cell viability is greater than 90%, live/dead dye staining can be omitted, and experiment can proceed directly to step 5.\nTransfer 4 million LN cells into each FACS tube and fill with 2 mL PBS.\nNote: For thymocytes, transfer 8 million cells into each FACS tube. The frequency of Foxp3+ Tregs is much lower among thymocytes than among LN cells. Therefore, it is necessary to use more thymocytes than LN cells to obtain sufficient number of cells for Foxp3+ Treg cell analysis (see Limitations).\nCentrifuge tubes at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 1 μL Ghost dye Violet 510 to each tube according to the staining chart, mix well and incubate the cells at 4°C for 20 min in the dark by covering the tubes with aluminum foil.",
    "Note: After discarding the supernatant, the cell pellet should be resuspended in the remaining buffer (in this case PBS) which is usually around 50 μL. In case that there is less residual buffer leftover, PBS can be added up to 50 μL.\nFill the tubes with 2 mL RPMI-1640 medium, centrifuge at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C to wash out excess dye.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 200 μL of prewarmed RPMI-1640 medium to each tube. Vortex the tubes gently and incubate cells in a 37°C water bath for 30 min.\nCritical: This step is necessary to allow the cells to dephosphorylate STAT5 from in vivo signaling and let the pSTAT5 return to basal levels.\nDuring the incubation, make a serial dilution of the 100 μg/mL IL-2 stock into each 2 mL of 2 ng/mL, 0.6 ng/mL, 0.2 ng/mL, and 0.06 ng/mL of IL-2 using RPMI-1640 medium. Also, prepare a tube of 4 mL RPMI-1640 medium without IL-2 as medium control. Prewarm the 5 tubes in a 37°C water bath.\nAdd each 250 μL of the 2 ng/mL, 0.6 ng/mL, 0.2 ng/mL, 0.06 ng/mL IL-2 solution to stimulation tubes (final concentration of IL-2 is 1 ng/mL, 0.3 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, and 0.03 ng/mL, respectively). Add 250 μL RPMI-1640 medium to the medium control tubes.\nIncubate the cell suspension in a 37°C water bath for 30 min.\nNote: The RPMI-1640 media that is used in the IL-2 stimulation should be serum-free.\nAntibody Staining of Fixed and Permeabilized Cells\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section describes how to stain cells for intranuclear Foxp3, intracellular pSTAT5, and surface markers.\nFoxp3 staining\nRemove tubes from 37°C water bath and place them immediately on ice.",
    "Add 3 mL of cold Foxp3 Fix/Perm solution to cells, and incubate the tubes on ice for 20 min.\nCritical: Because adding the Foxp3 Fix/Perm solution terminates IL-2 signaling, this step should be carefully timed.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 1 mL 1× Permeabilization buffer to each tube, and centrifuge at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nPause Point: The cell suspensions can be stored overnight (16–18 h) at 4°C after adding 1 mL 1× Permeabilization buffer to the cell pellet from step 6d.\nRepeat step 6d to wash the cells again.\nWhile the FACS tubes are spinning in the centrifuge, dilute eFluor 660-Foxp3 antibodies (1:10) in 1× Permeabilization buffer into working concentration.\nDiscard the supernatant, and add 5 μL Fc block solution to each tube to a final concentration of 1.25 μg/mL, including the single-color compensation tubes.\nAdd 10 μL of diluted eFluor 660-Foxp3 antibody to each sample tube and to the single-color compensation tubes for Foxp3 staining.\nNote: When using twice the number of cells for staining, such as for thymocytes staining, add twice the amount of Fc block solution (10 μL) and diluted eFluor 660-Foxp3 antibodies (20 μL) to each tube, because there are 8 million instead of the usual 4 million cells in each tube.\nGently vortex the FACS tubes and incubate cells at room temperature (RT, 20–25°C) for 30 min.\nFill the FACS tubes with 1 mL 1× Permeabilization buffer, and spin down at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, and repeat step 6j to wash the cells again.\nPhospho-STAT5 and isotype control staining\nResuspend pelleted cells from step 6k in 500 μL ice-cold HBSS.",
    "Add 500 μL 4% PFA (final concentration is 2% PFA) to each tube, mix gently, and vortex the tubes (Troubleshooting 2).\nIncubate FACS tubes on ice for 30 min.\nAdd 2 mL of ice-cold HBSS to each tube, and then centrifuge at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 2 mL of ice-cold HBSS to each tube to wash the cells again, followed by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 1 mL of prechilled 90% methanol to each tube.\nCritical: Make sure to prechill the 90% methanol at −80°C and keep it cold because warmed up methanol can disrupt the cell membrane. The repeated fixation and permeabilization steps are critical to achieve efficient permeabilization of the nuclear membrane while not losing intracellular pSTAT5 signals.\nIncubate the tubes on ice for 30 min.\nAdd 2 mL of ice-cold 10% FCS-HBSS to cells, and spin down cells at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and repeat step 7h to wash the cells again.\nResuspend cells in 170 μL of FACS buffer and split each sample into two tubes (around 110 μL for each tube).\nAdd 2 mL of cold FACS buffer to each tube, then spin down cells at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 10 μL of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated isotype control antibodies or 10 μL of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated pSTAT5 antibody to sample tubes, including the single-color compensation tube.\nGently mix the cells and incubate FACS tubes at room temperature (RT, 20°C–25°C) for 40 min.\nSurface marker staining",
    "While cells are incubating in step 7m, dilute the surface marker antibodies in FACS buffer according to the dilution factors as indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_297_11.csv\nNote: Antibodies conjugated with tandem dyes, such as PE-Cy7, should be always freshly diluted because of the possibility of degradation. On the other hand, antibodies conjugated with non-tandem dyes can be diluted to a working solution in advance and kept at 4°C for further use.\nUse 10 μL of each of the diluted antibodies to make a master mix for surface marker antibodies according to the number of samples. Make extra amounts of the master mix (calculate for 2 or 3 more samples than necessary) to secure sufficient amounts of antibodies and to compensate for pipetting errors.\nNote: We recommend making master mix when staining multiple antibodies to reduce variability between samples by pipetting.\nAdd 40 μL of the antibody master mix to each tube. For the single-color compensation tubes, add 10 μL of the diluted antibody according to the staining chart.\nIncubate tubes at room temperature (RT, 20°C–25°C) for 20 min.\nAdd 2 mL of cold FACS buffer to each tube, and then spin down cells at 1,500 rpm (500 × g) for 7 min at 10°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and repeat step 8e to wash the cells again.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 150 μL cold FACS buffer.\nFilter the cells into new FACS tubes using 60 μm nylon filters and place the tubes on ice until flow cytometric analysis.\nNote: Filter the cell suspension through 60 μm nylon filters to remove cellular aggregates. To prevent reaggregation, cells should be not filtered earlier than 30 min before the start of data acquisition.\nSample Collection and Data Analysis\nTiming: 3 h",
    "This section describes how to collect samples using a flow cytometer and which software to use for data analysis.\nUse unstained cells and single-color control staining to set appropriate PMT voltages and compensations for each parameter.\nAt least 0.5 million cells should be collected per tube at a flow rate of 6,000 events/s or less. A representative voltage setting for acquisition would be as follows: FCS: 565, SSC:330, Alexa Fluor 488: 500, PE: 500, PE-Cy7: 630, PacBlue: 390, eFluor 660: 460, Alexa Fluor 594: 510, Violet 510: 375.\nNote: The voltage of each parameter needs to be adjusted using unstained compensation tubes and single stained compensation tubes for each experiment.\nThe fcs format files were analyzed using FlowJo with linear scales for FCS-H and FCS-W, and log scales for fluorochrome parameters. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7, and the figures for publication were created in Canvas X."
