    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at SingHealth (Singapore). Female C57BL/6 J mice (6- 8 weeks old; 18-20 g) were obtained from InVivos, Singapore, and housed in a temperature and light-controlled vivarium of Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore. Animals were treated in accordance with the guidelines from the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research.\nNOTE: A flow chart highlighting the main procedures is shown in Figure 2.\n1. Preparation of contrast agents: Evans Blue (EB) and liposomes\nFor 2% EB dye solution, dissolve 1 g of EB in 50 mL of sterile saline. Filter the solution using 0.22 µm filters into 1.5 mL sterile tubes and store them at room temperature for later use.\nFor green-fluorescent liposomes, add POPC/Fl-DHPE (95:5), chloroform/methanol (2:1) into a 100 mL round bottom flask. Use a rotary evaporator at 150 rpm at 40 °C for 1 h, with vacuum maintained at 0 mbar1 to create a thin lipid film.\n\tNOTE: When comparing effects of liposomal properties (e.g., size, charge, lipid saturation, lipid chain length) on distribution, maintain a fixed percentage of Fl-DHPE or other fluorescent lipids to confirm that the results observed are due to the effect of the properties tested, and not to the variable load of large hydrophobic dyes.\nHydrate the lipid film with phosphate-buffered saline (to achieve 26.3 mM of fluorescent liposomes) at 40 °C to form multi-lamellar vesicles (MLV). Load the MLVs into a glass syringe for manual extrusion (30 times using a 0.08 µm pore size polycarbonate filter) to achieve the desired size of 100 nm.\n\tNOTE: The temperature for hydration must be higher than the transition temperature of the lipids.",
    "Filter the liposomes by passing them through a 0.22 µm sterile syringe filter. Confirm the hydrodynamic diameter (DH) of the liposomes using a dynamic light scattering system.\n2. Administration of EB and liposomes in live mice\nInject mouse with EB IV (intravenous) via the tail vein (2.5 mg/kg), 2 h before subconjunctival injection.\nFor subconjunctival injection, first, sedate the mouse using 5% isoflurane via inhalation in an induction chamber to achieve an adequate plane of anesthesia. Transfer the mouse to a nose cone and maintain sedation at 2%-2.5% of isoflurane while on a heating pad throughout the procedure.\nTrim the whiskers near the eye to be injected and instill a drop of topical anesthetic 0.5% proxymetacaine hydrochloride solution directly on the eye.\nLoad a 10 µL glass syringe (with 32 G needle) with fluorescent liposomes (Fl-DHPE: 0.78 mg/kg) and dispel all air bubbles in the syringe prior to injection.\n\tNOTE: Up to 20 µL of injectate can be accommodated in the subconjunctival space of mice18,19.\nUsing a tweezer, lift the conjunctiva slightly and inject slowly into the subconjunctival space (Figure 1A). Withdraw the needle slowly to prevent backflow. Ensure that a visible bleb filled with fluorescent liposomes is formed (Figure 1C).\nAdminister a drop of antibiotic 1% fusidic acid on the eye after the injection and monitor the mouse until it regains consciousness.\n3. CLM set-up\nSwitch on the CLM system and make sure both the connector and the distal tip of the scanning probe are clean.\nClean the connector of the scanning probe using an optical connector cleaner by following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\nPress the rachet (often colored) of the optical connector cleaner to reveal a cleaning ribbon.\nPosition the connector in contact with the cleaning ribbon and slide the connector along the ribbon while maintaining contact.",
    "Clean the distal tip (also known as the scanning tip) of the probe by dipping it into the cleansing solution, followed by the rinsing solution provided by the manufacturer. A cotton tip applicator can also be used for more thorough cleaning if the tip is very dirty.\nConnect the probe to the CLM system. Choose the Field of view (FOV) and the location for the acquisition files at this point.\n\tNOTE: Adjust the laser intensity at this step to ensure that fluorescence detection for Fl-DHPE is in the linear range. Laser intensity is to be kept consistent for comparison between images taken at different time points.\nAllow the system to warm up for 15 min as instructed and use the calibration kit to calibrate the system according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: In the calibration kit, there are three vials for each laser containing the following solutions: cleansing solution, rinsing solution, and fluorophore 488/660 nm solution for internal calibration. The calibration steps are prompted by the system and are to be followed accordingly.\n\t\nImmerse the tip in the cleansing vial followed by the rinsing vial (5 s in each vial). Leave it in the air for background recording for both channels.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is very crucial as it normalizes the background values from different fibers of the probe and ensures image uniformity.\nImmerse the tip in the cleansing vial followed by the rinsing vial (5 s in each vial). Immerse the tip in fluorophore 488 nm vial for 5 seconds to normalize signal values from different fibers in the probe.",
    "Immerse the tip in the cleansing vial followed by the rinsing vial (5 s in each vial). Immerse the tip in the rinsing vial until the fluorescence signal recorded in 3.5.2. disappears. Immerse the tip in fluorophore 660 nm vial to normalize signal values from different fibers in the probe.\n\t\tNOTE: Follow all the calibration steps in order to achieve proper calibration and optimal image quality.\nAfter calibrating the probe, check to make sure the background values for the probes are as low as possible. For the CLM system used, keep the background values below 100. Perform repeated cleaning of the probe with a cotton tip applicator and calibration if values are above 100/defined user value or if the probe appears to be dirty. This is to ensure that the background noise is kept around the same value.\n\tNOTE: It is important to define the maximum background value (for example, 100 as stated in step 3.6) to ensure that probe conditions are similar. This will allow proper quantitative comparison between images taken at different time points. The value may differ in different systems and probe conditions.\nSwitch on the animal temperature controller (ATC). Adjust the ATC to 37 °C. Cover the heating pad with a surgical drape and fix the nose cone on the heating pad.\n\tNOTE: ATC with an attached heating pad is required to ensure that the animal is kept warm throughout the imaging duration.\nClamp the stand of the dissecting microscope to the tabletop to secure it. Rotate and adjust the eyepiece of the microscope to view the mouse eye ergonomically through the eyepiece when the user is seated (make the adjustments after placing the animal).",
    "Sedate the mouse using 5% isoflurane in an induction chamber. Transfer the mouse to the nose cone once the animal is non-responsive and maintain sedation at 2%-2.5% isoflurane while on a heating pad throughout the procedure.\nTrim the whiskers of the mouse and instill a drop of anesthetic 0.5% proxymetacaine hydrochloride solution onto the eye.\nTo make sure the eyes are clean, drop a few drops of saline to wash the ocular surface.\nAdjust the microscope so that the mouse eye is in direct focus at 0.67x magnification.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to lubricate the eyes with saline. If the eyes are not lubricated throughout the imaging session, they can get dry, causing the lens to crystallize. As a result, during CLM imaging, the lens can emit a background red fluorescence.\n4. Live imaging of mouse eyes with CLM and acquisition\nTurn on the laser, place the probe on the eye and start recording acquisition to observe the fluorescence in the eye at the regions indicated on the eye map in Figure 3.\n\tNOTE: Hold the probe like a pen with the distal end of the probe directly onto the region to be imaged.\nStop the recording when all regions have been flagged and labeled. The acquisition files will be saved automatically in the file location chosen in step 3.4.\n\tNOTE: The file will be saved as a video file which can be exported to individual images. Label the flag according to the eye map to know exactly the location of the probe at the exact frame the recording was done.\n5. Image analysis",
    "Using the same CLM acquisition software, export the image acquisition files for further analysis. Click on File | Export and choose the format to be exported to. Mkt format files will allow adjustments of look up table (LUT) and further exports to image file formats using the CLM viewer software.\nFor accurate comparison of fluorescence intensity, use the same LUT adjusted for each channel when exporting all image files.\n\tNOTE: Choose the minimum and maximum LUT threshold with respect to those of the control mouse (with no liposomes injected) to minimize background fluorescence readings.\nOpen the image in an appropriate image processing software/freeware program (e.g., ImageJ). Draw the region of interest (ROI).\n\tNOTE: ROI here refers to the region of interest in the processing program. In most cases, ROI will be the whole image scanned. However, in the case of imaging the limbus, the probe cannot just get the image of the limbus separately. Therefore, an ROI has to be drawn to 'quantify' the fluorescence in the limbus region, as drawn in Figure 4.To keep the ROI consistent, use the same ROI across all images.\nMeasure and record the ROI values for green fluorescence. Enter the values in a spreadsheet. Tabulate the average and fluorescence intensity (a.u.) values of the ROI.\n6. Histology assessment\nEuthanize the mouse using a method approved by the local IACUC. \nEnucleate the eye and fix the eye in 1 mL of 4% formaldehyde or 10% formalin solution overnight.\nTrim excess fats and embed the eye in the Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound and keep it frozen in a -80 °C freezer for at least one day.\nCut sections of 5 µm thickness in the cryostat with cutting temperature maintained at 20 °C. Transfer the section to a Poly-L-Lysine-coated microscope slide.",
    "NOTE: Histology can serve as additional validation of the distribution of DDS. However, it requires additional optimization, technical expertise, and sacrifice of animals which the study aims to reduce by using CLM.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
