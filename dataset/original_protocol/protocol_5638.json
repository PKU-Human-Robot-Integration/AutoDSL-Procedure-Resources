    "Isolation of WJ-MSCsTo isolate mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton’s jelly of human umbilical cord, use the explants culture method.Collect fresh human umbilical cord after full-term birth (normal or cesarean) with informed consent (Figure 1) and transport it to the lab in an empty sterile 50 ml centrifuge tube on ice.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180211/20180211194022_9531.jpgFigure 1. Fresh umbilical cord after collectionRinse off the blood and blood clots using normal saline. Cut the cord into 2-3 cm pieces (Figure 2) and incubate the pieces in normal saline containing 1x antibiotic-antimycotic (100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin and 250 ng/ml of amphotericin B) at 4 °C for about 2 h.Note: This incubation step in saline containing antibiotic-antimycotic is carried out mainly to disinfect the umbilical cord tissue.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180211/20180211194143_2136.jpgFigure 2. The umbilical cord cut into 2-3 cm long piecesAfter 2 h, inside the laminar flow tissue culture hood, rinse the cord pieces three times with sterile PBS (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Rinsing umbilical cord pieces with 70% ethanol and PBS Next disinfect the cord pieces briefly by rinsing with 70% ethanol for 30 sec. Wash thoroughly three more times with PBS to remove any traces of ethanol (Video 1).Transfer one cord piece into an empty 10 cm cell culture dish, while the tube containing the other pieces can be stored on ice. Using forceps try to straighten the twists, if any, in the cord piece and using a scalpel fixed to a scalpel holder make a longitudinal slit along the length (Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Removal of artery from umbilical cord piece There are two arteries and one vein inside the cord. Cut open flaps of tissue to expose an artery and then trace the artery using scissors and forceps and remove it. The underlying perivascular Wharton’s jelly tissue can now be neatly excised (Video 2).",
    "Chop the excised tissue into smaller 3-5 mm pieces with the help of the scalpel and place in an empty 35 mm tissue culture dish using a fine forceps (Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Plating small explants of WJ portion of human umbilical cord Allow the cord pieces to attach for about 5 min with air drying. Next add 2 ml of warm fresh MSC isolation medium carefully, drop-wise and gently, taking care not to dislodge the tissue pieces (Video 3).Place about 10-15 explants in each 35 mm tissue culture dish and use about four to five 35 mm tissue culture dishes per umbilical cord sample.Place the tissue culture dishes containing the cord explants in a CO2 incubator maintaining 37 °C and 5% CO2.Note: Discard the remaining tissue pieces in a biohazard waste bag. All the liquid waste should be collected in a beaker containing sodium hypochlorite solution and discarded appropriately.After 48 h, give the first medium change with 2 ml of warm fresh MSC isolation medium. Following this, media changes are given with 2 ml of fresh MSC isolation medium every 72 h.After about 7-10 days, once enough cells have come out from the explants (Figure 3), remove the cord pieces using 1 ml blunt-end tips and add 2 ml of warm fresh MSC isolation medium.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180211/20180211194438_8173.jpgFigure 3. Phase contrast image of MSCs emerging from an umbilical cord tissue piece explantEstablishment of MSC cultureAfter 24-48 h of cord piece removal and depending on confluency, carefully aspirate medium and wash cells twice with DPBS.Note: As the cells are growing out in patches from the explants at this stage, within each patch cells should be ~50-80% confluent.Add 250 µl of TrypLE to each 35 mm tissue culture dish and let the cells detach for 4-6 min at 37 °C.",
    "Note: Trypsin can be used as a substitute for TrypLE. TrypLE is an animal origin-free recombinant enzyme which is gentle on stem cells, thus preserving well cell’s surface proteins.Add 1 ml of warm fresh MSC growth medium to the cells and transfer them to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at room temperature for 2 min at 500 x g.Aspirate medium, add 500 µl of warm fresh MSC growth medium to the cell pellet and suspend the pellet. Mix a small aliquot of cell suspension with an equal volume of trypan blue, and count the live (non-blue) cells using a hemocytometer.As a next step, seed WJ-MSCs at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 in 2 ml of warm fresh MSC growth medium in a 35 mm tissue culture dish or any appropriate cell culture vessel.Culture them for 72 h or till cells are 70-80% confluent. No medium change required in between.Detach cells with TrypLE, count and seed for the next passage, repeating Steps B2-B6.Note: TrypLE, MSC growth medium and DPBS need to be pre-warmed to 37 °C before start of trypsinization or detachment of cells.Freezing and reviving of WJ-MSCsOnce the WJ-MSCs are 70-80% confluent, detach with 250 µl TrypLE as per Step B2.Add 1 ml of warm fresh MSC growth medium to the cells and transfer them to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Take an aliquot for counting and centrifuge the remaining cells at 500 x g for 2 min at room temperature.Aspirate supernatant and suspend the cells directly in freezing medium at ~2 x 106 cells/ml.Aliquot 150-200 µl cell suspension into cryogenic vials and transfer the cryogenic vials to a Mr. FrostyTM freezing container containing isopropanol.Place the Mr.",
    "FrostyTM freezing container at -80 °C freezer for ~24 h before transferring the cryogenic vials to a liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage.For revival, remove a cryogenic vial with frozen WJ-MSCs from the liquid nitrogen tank and immediately transfer it to a beaker containing water at 37 °C.Once the cell suspension has thawed, inside the laminar flow hood add 1 ml of warm fresh MSC growth medium to the cell suspension in the cryogenic vial and transfer the contents to a 15 ml centrifuge tube containing 3-4 ml of additional warm fresh MSC growth medium.Centrifuge the cells at room temperature at 500 x g for 2-3 min to wash off the DMSO.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 0.5 ml of fresh warm MSC growth medium. Mix well by pipetting, count the live cells and plate up to 2-3 x 105 cells on a 35 mm tissue culture plate in 2 ml of warm fresh MSC growth medium.Note: During thawing and revival of MSCs, cells are plated at a higher density in order to maximize recovery.Transfer the dish to a CO2 incubator and replace medium with 2 ml of warm fresh MSC growth medium the next day.After 48 h of reviving and plating, detach cells with TrypLE and seed for the next passage.Immunophenotyping by flow cytometryTake WJ-MSCs at passage 4-5. Detach them with TrypLE and count the cell number as per Steps B2-B4.Wash the harvested cells 1-2 times with ice cold PBS by centrifuging at 600 x g for 2 min.Discard the supernatant and suspend cells in PBS at 2 x 106 cells/ml.Distribute 1 x 105 cells or 50 µl of cell suspension in each of the pre-labeled 5 ml FACS tubes.",
    "Add the PE or FITC labeled antibodies as per Table 1 and incubate on ice for 45-60 min. Mouse isotype antibodies can serve as controls (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180211/20180211195029_9753.jpgFigure 4. Immunophenotyping of WJ-MSCs as demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis. Open histograms represent background signal while shaded histograms indicate positive reactivity with the indicated antibodies. WJ-MSCs are positive for CD73 (A), CD90 (B) and CD 105 (C), and negative for CD34 (D)."
