    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nTissue Harvesting\nTiming: 20 min\nWhen using late embryonic stage (E17–18) rat fetuses, euthanize the dam, then remove the uterus and free individual fetuses from the embryonic sack (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/166-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of Rat Fetuses for Primary Neuron Culture\n(A) Euthanized pregnant female rat.\n(B) Opening in the mid-ventral side of the rat.\n(C) Prenatal pups in the uterus.\n(D) Opening the uterus and removing pups using autoclaved sterile forceps.\nPlace fetuses into a sterile Petri dish and continue as outlined below.\nDecapitate rat fetus or pup, following guidelines approved by the researcher’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\nRemove skin and skull and place each brain in a 60-mm Petri dish containing ice-cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) onto an ice pack.\nUnder the dissecting microscope, dissect hippocampi or cortices one at a time in a 100-mm Petri dish containing enough dissection solution to cover the tissue.\nOnce meninges are removed and the hippocampus or cortex is freed from the brain, cut out the extra tissue and transfer the hippocampus or cortex to a 35-mm Petri dish containing HBSS.\nTissue Dissociation\nTiming: 20 min\nAfter all hippocampi or cortices have been collected, transfer them to a 15-mL conical tube containing papain solution and allow them to incubate at 37°C for 15 min.\nNote: Prepare papain solution freshly in a 15-mL conical tube immediately before starting dissection.\nNote: During the papain incubation step, wash the coverslips three times with deionized water, place in wells of a 12-well plate, and add 1.5 mL warmed CNB medium to each well.\nStop the digestion by removing papain solution using a 1-mL pipette.",
    "Add 5 mL of HBSS, close the tube and invert it gently a few times. Let the hippocampi or cortices settle for about 2 min and then remove the HBSS.\nRepeat Step 9 two more times.\nAdd 1 mL of CNB medium and triturate tissues with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette 40 times. Try not to introduce air bubbles during this step.\nPlating Dissociated Cultured Neurons on Coated Coverslips\nTiming: 5 min\nDilute 20 μL of cell suspension into 180 μL of plating media and count cells on a hemocytometer.\nPlate 3.0 × 105 cells onto 18-mm poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips placed in wells of a 12-well plate containing warmed CNB medium.\nMaintain cultures at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nThe next day, replace the medium with fresh CNB medium (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/166-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Micrograph of Primary Hippocampal Neurons at 1 Day In Vitro (DIV1)\nScale bar, 0.2 mm.\nNote: It is important to monitor cultures daily for potential problem; otherwise, planned experiments could be compromised. However, observations should be as brief as possible to minimize stress (e.g., light exposure, pH and temperature variations) on the cells.\nTransfection of Cultured Neurons with Plasmids\nTiming: 60 min\nAt about DIV7, check the quality of the plated neurons by observing them under a microscope (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/166-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "For each transfection, prepare Solution A and Solution B in separate sterile microcentrifuge tubes according to the manufacturer’s instructions (CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit). For each ∼3.5 × 105 neurons plated in a 12-well plate, make Solution A by mixing 8 μg of pCAGG-VGLUT1-Venus plasmid DNA with 9 μL of a 2 M CaCl2 solution and sufficient deionized water to bring the total volume to 75 μL. Solution B consists of 75 μL of 2× HBS.\nNote: Prepare pCAGG-VGLUT1-Venus plasmids by DIV7 using an endotoxin-free DNA Midi Kit.\nCarefully vortex Solution A while adding Solution B dropwise (usually takes 30 s∼1 min per reaction).\nIncubate the mixed A+B Solution at 24°C–26°C for 30 min.\nWhile the A+B solution incubates, use forceps to transfer a coverslip with plated neurons to another 12-well plate containing 2 mL of MEM and 10 μL of 1 M MgCl2.\nNote: Retain the 12-well plate containing CNB medium conditioned by the original cultures of coverslip-plated neurons.\nGently vortex transfection (A+B) solution and then add the solution dropwise to wells of a 12-well plate containing coverslip-plated neurons.\nGently move the plate back and forth to evenly distribute the transfection solution.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 15 min.\nCritical: it is imperative that precipitates can be clearly observed under a microscope after the 15-min incubation period. If precipitates are not detected, incubate for an additional 5–10 min.\nPrepare 6-well plates containing 2 mL of HBSS per well (three wells are normally needed to process each coverslip).\nTransfer the coverslip to the first well of a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of HBSS and gently shake the plate.\nTransfer the coverslip to the second well of a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of HBSS and gently shake the plate.",
    "Transfer the coverslip to the third well of a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of HBSS and gently shake the plate.\nTransfer the coverslip to the 12-well plate containing the original neuron-conditioned CNB medium.\nTwenty-four hours later, assess the success of transfection by monitoring VGLUT1-Venus fluorescence in neurons under a fluorescence microscope.\nCritical: Transfected neurons start to become visible under a fluorescence microscope ∼12 h after transfection.\nImmunocytochemistry\nTiming: ∼3 h\nAt DIV14, aspirate CNB medium from 12-well plates and wash coverslip-plated neurons by adding ice-cold PBS.\nNote: Before immunocytochemistry procedures, inspect all transfected neurons under a fluorescence microscope to ensure their viability and health.\nAdd fixing solution and incubate for 10 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the fixing solution and wash neurons by adding ice-cold PBS.\nRepeat Step 32 twice more.\nAdd permeabilization solution to 12-well plates and incubate at 24°C–26°C for 10 min.\nAspirate the permeabilization solution and incubate with PBS-BH solution at 24°C–26°C for 15 min to block nonspecific binding of antibodies.\nIncubate with primary antibodies as follows:\nPrepare 100 μL of primary antibody solution (anti-Bassoon [diluted 1:100] and anti-GFP [diluted in 1:1,000] in PBS-BH solution) per coverslip.\nNote: Antibodies that label other active zone proteins (e.g., Piccolo, RIM1, or Munc13-1) would serve the same purpose as the anti-Bassoon antibody and could be substituted for it in this step.\nPlace a 100-μL drop of primary antibody solution on a parafilm-coated plate for each coverslip.\nRetrieve the coverslips using forceps, and place onto drops of primary antibody solution, and incubate at 24°C–26°C for 1 h.\nWash coverslip-plated neurons by transferring coverslips to wells of a 12-well plate filled with 1× PBS.\nRepeat Step 37 once more.\nIncubate with secondary antibodies as follows:",
    "Prepare 100 μL of secondary antibody solution (anti-mouse-Cy3 [diluted 1:500] and anti-goat-FITC [diluted in 1:150] in PBS-BH solution) for each coverslip.\nPlace 100-μL drop of secondary antibody solution on a parafilm-coated plate for each coverslip.\nRetrieve coverslips using forceps, place onto drops of secondary antibody solution, and incubate at 24°C–26°C for 1 h. Cover plates with foil to minimize light exposure.\nWash coverslip-plated neurons by transferring coverslips to wells of a 12-well plate filled with 1× PBS.\nRepeat Step 40 once more.\nPrepare microscope slides (Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific) and place a drop of VECTASHIELD antifade mounting medium (H-1200; Vector Laboratories) on the surface of the slide.\nRetrieve coverslips from the 12-well plate using forceps and place on slide glasses with neurons facing down.\nSeal each coverslip with transparent nail polish.\nConfocal Imaging\nTiming: 1–3 days (depending on the number of coverslips)\nAcquire Z-stack images in standard mode using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM800 with Airyscan module) equipped with a 63× objective (0.156 μm/pixel; X-Y dimension 1,024 × 1,024) and Zen2.6 Software (Zeiss).\nConfigure Z-stack images using Acquisition Dimensions and four slices with a 1.2-μm interval setting.\nGenerate maximum intensity projections for all captured Z-stack files (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/166-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
