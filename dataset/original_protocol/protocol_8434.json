    "1. Measurement of Luciferase Reporter Signals, which Correspond to γ-Secretase Cleavage of APP-C99 or NΔE\nNOTE: Please refer to the previous publications for detailed descriptions of the generation of CG and NG cells20,21.\nSeed NG or CG cells (20, 000 cells/well) onto 96-well microplates at a final volume of 200 μL/well in growth medium that is composed of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 μg/mL blasticidin, 250 μg/mL antibiotic (e.g., zeocin), and 200 μg/mL hygromycin B.\nCount cells with a hemocytometer.\nTransfer the microplates to a humidified CO2 incubator and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\nRemove 100 μL of growth medium from each well.\nAdd 100 μL/well of growth medium containing 2 μg/mL tetracycline with either 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 2 μM CL-387,785, 2 μM N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butylester (DAPT), or other related ErbB1/ErbB2 inhibitors.\nIncubate treated CG or NG cells in microplates at 37 °C for 24 h.\nRemove 150 μL/well growth medium from microplates.\nAdd 50 μL/well luciferase assay reagent (please see Table of Materials).\nTransfer the microplates to a luminescence microplate reader.\nMaintain the microplates at room temperature for 5 min with gentle agitation.\nDetermine the Firefly luciferase (FL)-emitted luminescence using a pre-defined program stored in the luminescence microplate reader.\nOpen the instrument control software (see Table of Materials for instrument details).\nFrom the 'Tool' menu, select 'Luminometry'.\n\t\t\nUnder the 'Parameters' settings, choose 'No filter' for Emission Filter, tick 'Normal' for Emission Aperture, enter '1' for Counting Time, and click on 'OK' to set up the luminescence reading.\nUnder the 'Instrument control' tab, scroll through the list of active protocols, and select the pre-stored protocol for reading luminescence.\nUnder the 'Live display' tab, define the Scale from the pull-down list, and select 'Logarithm' or 'Linear' for the Type.",
    "Under the 'Temperature' tab, select 'Off' for Plate heating.\nClick the 'Start' button to perform the luminescence reading.\nAs needed, export results into a spreadsheet format using the 'Explorer' embedded within the control software.\n2. Quantification of γ-Secretase Activity\nDefine a luminescence signal emitted by CG or NG cells treated with 0.1% DMSO in growth medium containing 1 μg/mL tetracycline alone as 100% relative γ-secretase activity.\nEstimate background luminescence from CG or NG cells by treating cells with growth medium that does not include tetracycline.\nNormalize luciferase signals from CG or NG cells that are cultured with growth medium containing 1 μg/mL tetracycline and either 1 μM CL-387,785 or 1 μM of DAPT with the luciferase signal emitted by DMSO-treated CG or NG cells (100% relative γ-secretase activity, as defined in 2.1).\nSubscription Required.
