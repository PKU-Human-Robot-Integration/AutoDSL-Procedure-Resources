    "Plant growth and root harvestSow sterilized Arabidopsis seeds (1 min in 95% ethanol, 15 min in Bleach [6-14% sodium hypochlorite], and 6 washes with sterilized water) on Petri dish with Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0.7% agar and 2.5 mM MES, pH 5.7 (see Recipes).Stratify seeds in the dark for 3 to 4 days at 4 °C, and transfer plates to a controlled-environment growth chamber under long-day conditions (16 h of light and 8 h of darkness) at a temperature of 22 °C. Grow seedlings for up to 4 weeks. For soil-grown plants, transfer 2 week-old seedlings grown on MS medium plates to pots containing pre-wetted peat moss-vermiculite-perlite (3:1:1, v/v/v) growing medium (about 700 cm3 per pot). Five plants per pots. Place the pots at 22 °C in a controlled-environment growth chamber with ambient humidity under long-day conditions.For collecting roots from tissue culture-grown seedlings, use a pair of scissors to eliminate the aerial portions of the seedlings, remove the entire agar medium disc from the Petri dish and place it upside down in the dish cover. With tweezers, collect the roots from the agar. It is not necessary to wash the roots after collecting them from the agar medium.For collecting roots from soil-grown plants, carefully eliminate the soil growing medium by soaking in water, use a pair of scissors to separate roots from other parts of the plant, and rinse roots thoroughly with distilled water to remove as much as possible the remaining growth medium. Non-extraction methodPool roots to form bundles of roots. Make 4 to 5 replicates.Dry roots as much as possible by pressing the material several times between paper towels, (i.e., until paper towels stay dry).Measure the fresh weight (FW). For Arabidopsis, 5 to 25 mg of FW roots is necessary per replicate.",
    "Solvent-extraction methodPool roots to form bundles of roots.Dry roots with a paper towel and measure the fresh weight (FW). For Arabidopsis, 70 to 100 mg of FW roots is necessary per replicate.Place freshly collected roots in glass extraction tube containing 4 ml hot (85 °C) isopropanol and incubate for 30 min at 85 °C in dry heating block. After cooling to room temperature, reduce to a fine powder with a Polytron when large root or lots of material is analyzed to allow efficient delipidation.After sedimentation of the residue, transfer isopropanol phase to a new glass tube and delipidate further the roots by extracting soluble lipids successively with:4 ml chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v)4 ml chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v)4 ml chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v)4 ml 100% methanolPerform all delipidation steps at room temperature for 24 h on a tube rotator with the wheel rotating at 40 rpm. Following each delipidation step, collect the solvent fraction in the same 9 ml glass tube, with the newly collected solvent being reduced each time under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas such that no solvent splashes out of the tube (but not completely dry so as to minimize oxidation of lipids). At the end, fully dry the resulting pooled extract, which corresponds to the soluble lipid fraction, resuspend it in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1; [v:v]), and store it at 4 °C until further analysis as described in the fatty acyl-chain analysis section.Following final delipidation step with methanol, dry the resulting solvent-extracted root material in a fume hood at room temperature for 2-3 days. This delipidated dry residue will contain the suberin polymer. Place the tubes containing the delipidated roots (without caps) in a dessicator for another 2 days before measuring the dried residues (DR) weight (usually representing 10 to 15% of FW).",
    "Fatty acyl-chain analysis by GC-MSAdd 1 ml of 5% (v/v) sulfuric acid in methanol containing 5 µg each of heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), pentadecanol (C15:0-OH) and C15-hydroxypentadecanoic acid (ω-OH-C15:0) as internal standards to the freshly collected roots (non-extraction method), or the solvent extracted dried residues, or to one fifth (200 µl) of the soluble lipid fraction (solvent extraction method). Close tubes tightly and incubate for 3 h at 85 °C in a dry heating block without agitation. This transmethylation step depolymerizes the suberin polymer as well as releases the acyl-chains making them all soluble lipids.After cooling at room temperature, add to each tube 1 ml of NaCl (2.5%, w/v) and 2.2 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and mix by shaking vigorously.Centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature to allow phase separation, and transfer the upper MTBE phase to a clean glass tube using a glass Pasteur pipet.Add 1 ml of 100 mM Tris base pH 8.0 containing 0.09% (w/v) NaCl to the MTBE phase, mix by shaking vigorously, and centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature to allow phase separation.Collect the upper MTBE phase in a clean glass tube using a glass Pasteur pipet, avoiding any aqueous (lower) phase, and evaporate MTBE under a gentle stream of nitrogen. It is better to leave behind some of the upper MTBE phase than to contaminate with any aqueous (lower) phase.Add 100 μl of 99% BSTFA (N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide) with 1% TMCS, close tube tightly, and incubate at 110 °C for 15 min in a dry heating block without agitation. This step trimethylsilylates the free hydroxyl groups making compounds containing these groups more amenable to separation by gas chromatography.",
    "After cooling at room temperature, evaporate the solvent under a gentle stream of nitrogen and dissolve the products in 250 μl heptane:toluene (1:1, v/v).Transfer each sample into a GC vial containing a glass insert.For GC-MS analysis, a 1 µl aliquot of the sample dissolved in heptane:toluene (1:1) is injected in splitless mode. The temperature of the injector is held at 250 °C. The column oven temperature is held at 50 °C for 1 min and then increased from 50 °C to 200 °C at a rate of 25 °C per minute, followed by a 1 min hold, and then is ramped up again at a rate of 10 °C per minute to a final temperature of 320 °C, which is held for 8 min. The total run time is 28 min. High purity helium is used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 ml per min."
