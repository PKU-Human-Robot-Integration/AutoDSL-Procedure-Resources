    "In this section, we describe the procedure to measure polyP and total P in C. reinhardtii. The first step is to culture algae cells. Next, collect an appropriate number of algae cells to extract P (polyP or total P) and then digest polyP or total P into Pi by hydrochloric acid or nitric acid from dried cells. To quantify the Pi released, the malachite green colorimetric method is used.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4692/bioprotoc-13-11-4692-g001.jpgFigure 1. Basic workflow of cell culture and P measurement. A. Procedure for algae cell culture. B and C show the procedures for polyP and total P measurement, respectively. Drawn and composed using Microsoft PowerPoint.Culture methods Protocols adapted from Wang et al. (2021).Cell culture is grown using 20 mL of TAP medium in a 50 mL flask. Stationary-phase cell culture with a volume of 200 μL is transferred into 20 mL of fresh medium every week. The culture growth conditions are adjusted to a speed of 150 rpm shaking at 25 °C using a rocking incubator, and the culture itself is illuminated continuously with white fluorescent light (150 μmol photons m-2 s-1). A cell density of approximately 1 × 107 cells (3–5 days after transfer, late linear phase) is used for the experiment.The following provides specific steps:Pick wildtype (CC-4533) and mutant (Crptc1) or other desired strain(s) from a fresh plate with a sterile toothpick or pipette tip and inoculate with 20 mL of liquid medium (TAP medium or appropriate selection medium) using a 50 mL flask. Rotate at 150 rpm and 25 °C for 5–7 days under continuous white light. This primary culture is grown to a stationary phase.Inoculate cultures into a 50 mL flask with 20 mL of TAP medium and adjust inoculum size appropriately to make the OD750 of inoculated solution approximately 0.2–0.3.",
    "Cultures will reach the stable period (~1 × 107 cells) again after 5–7 days. The OD750 should be measured every 12 h to count the number of algae cells.Transfer 1 mL of the secondary algae cells into a 250 mL flask containing 100 mL of TAP medium and incubate for 3–5 days.After three times of uniformization, different algae strains reach the same or similar growth status.Optional:Determine the OD750 every 12 h, calculate the regression equation, and draw the growth curve.Note: The growth phase can be determined by measuring cell density and drawing the growth curve. Extraction of P This section contains two parts. The first one is the purification and degradation of polyP and the second one is the digestion of total P in algae with nitric acid. After purification and degradation, polyP and total phosphorus content is converted into Pi released and can be measured using the malachite green colorimetric method.Purification and degradation of polyPProtocol adapted from Werner et al. (2005), Canadell et al. (2016), and Wang et al. (2021).Determine the OD750 of the algae using a spectrophotometer and record it.Add 500 μL of algae (record the exact weight) into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. After centrifugation at 8,000× g for 5 min at room temperature, remove all the supernatant by pipetting and harvest the algae cells.Note: The sample can be directly purified or stored at -20 °C. For more accurate measurements of dry weight, 5 mL of algae is filtered on 47 mm filter paper sheets using a vacuum pump, and then put in a drying oven for several hours (Figure 1). The weight of the 47 mm filter paper sheet should be measured using an analytical balance before and after sample loading.",
    "Add 50 μL of 1 M H2SO4 (see Recipes) into the algae, mix by pipetting or vortex to homogenate, and then place the tube at room temperature for 5 min.Neutralize the suspension with 50 μL of 2 M NaOH (see Recipes) and 100 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented to 6% (v/v) with 0.1% neutral red solution (see Recipes). Gently mix the tubes upside down four times.Note: The pH indicator helps to assure that the pH is around 7 (the sample color becomes orange red), which is a critical step for the reproducibility of polyP extraction. Samples too acidic (pink) or too basic (yellow) have to be corrected to the appropriate pH (orange red) by the addition of 2 M NaOH or 1 M H2SO4, respectively. Centrifuge at 1,600× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Drain 150 μL of supernatant with a pipette into a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube containing 450 μL of 6 M NaI (freshly prepared; see Recipes).Mix by pipetting 3–5 times and then transfer to a silica gel column (Spin Columns CA2 from TIANgel Midi Purification kit). Centrifuge the column at 12,000× g for 1 min at room temperature.Discard the flowthrough and place the column back into the collection tube. Add 400 μL of wash buffer (see Recipes) into the column and centrifuge the column at 12,000× g for 1 min at room temperature.Repeat step B1h.Discard the flowthrough, place the column back into the collection tube, and centrifuge at 12,000× g for 2 min at room temperature to remove residual wash buffer.Transfer the column into a clean 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and place the column with the cap open for 2–5 min to dry the membrane.",
    "Add 50 μL of ddH2O to the center of the membrane, incubate at room temperature for 2 min, and then centrifuge at 12,000× g for 2 min at room temperature.Note: The eluted polyP can be directly degraded; however, leaving it at room temperature for a longer time should be avoided. For long-term storage, it can be kept at -20 °C. Pipette 10 μL of eluted polyP and add 10 μL of 2 M HCl (see Recipes), mix thoroughly, and centrifuge for several seconds.Incubate at 95 °C for 30 min in the thermal cycler and then transfer onto the ice.The degraded polyP sample can be directly measured with the malachite green colorimetric method or stored at -20 °C.Determination of total PMark a 2 mL centrifuge tube and weigh it.Collect 10–15 mL of cells into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 2,070× g for 5 min at room temperature.Discard the supernatant, wash the algae cells with ddH2O, and centrifuge at 2,070× g for 5 min at room temperature.Repeat step B2c.Discard the supernatant, suspend the algae cells with 1 mL of ddH2O, and transfer the entire suspension to the 2 mL centrifuge tube.Centrifuge at 12,000× g for 5 min at room temperature and pipette all the supernatant carefully in case of loss of algae samples.Dry and weigh the tube with algae samples.Add 0.4–1.0 mL of concentrated HNO3 and incubate overnight at 4 °C until the solution is clean.Transfer the solution into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, wash the inside of the 2 mL centrifuge tube with ddH2O, transfer all the wash water into the 50 mL centrifuge tube, and dilute with ddH2O to 50 mL.This sample can then be analyzed for P concentration determination using the malachite green colorimetric method.",

    "According to the Pi concentration gradient in the table, add these substances in order:Add Pi solution (10 μg/mL) (see Recipes) and the corresponding volume of ddH2O.Add 86 μL of 28 mM ammonium heptamolybdate in 2.1 M H2SO4 (see Recipes).Add 64 μL of 0.76 mM malachite green in 0.35% polyvinyl alcohol (see Recipes).Leave the 96-well ELISA plate at room temperature for 30 min and measure the OD595 with a microplate reader.Note: Do not let the reaction proceed for more than 1 h as it can cause the appearance of small precipitates in highly concentrated Pi samples and polyP degradation in background samples, thus interfering with the correct Pi measure. Draw the standard curve by taking the volume of Pi solution (10 μg/mL) as the x-axis and the OD595 as the y-axis. Then, the P concentration of the samples can be calculated according to the standard curve.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4692/bioprotoc-13-11-4692-g002.jpgFigure 2. Standard curve. Pi concentration as x-axis and the OD595 as the y-axis. Drawn using Microsoft Excel and Prism GraphPad.Determination of P in samplesUse a 96-well plate for the reaction and measurement of polyP. To quantify released Pi, add to each well 10 μL of polyP after degradation, 90 μL of ddH2O, 86 μL of 28 mM ammonium heptamolybdate in 2.1 M H2SO4 (see Recipes), and 64 μL of 0.76 mM malachite green in 0.35% polyvinyl alcohol (see Recipes), in this order. Mix the well by pipetting gently.The blank control consists of 100 μL of ddH2O, 86 μL of 28 mM ammonium heptamolybdate in 2.1 M H2SO4, and 64 μL of 0.76 mM malachite green in 0.35% polyvinyl alcohol.Leave the 96-well plate at room temperature for 30 min and measure the OD595 with a microplate reader.Results imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4692/bioprotoc-13-11-4692-g003.jpgFigure 3.

    "(A) and (B) show filter paper sheets of 5 mL cells through a vacuum pump. The weight of algae cells was calculated using the dry weight difference of filter paper before and after filtration. PolyP content (C) and total P content (D) of the wildtype strain CC-4533 and the Crptc1 mutant. CrPTC1 is a vacuole efflux phosphate transporter in algae and catalyzes Pi transport out of acidocalcisomes. The Crptc1 mutant over-accumulates total P and polyP (Wang et al., 2021). Data is presented as the mean ± SD from five independent experiments. Pictures were taken using a Nikon Digital Camera D7200. C and D were drawn using Microsoft Excel and Prism GraphPad."
