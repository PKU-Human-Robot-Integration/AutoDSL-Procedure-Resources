    "All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined in the federal regulations as set forth in the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), the 1996 Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, PHS Policy for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, as well as the institution’s policies and procedures as set forth in the Animal Care and Use Training Manual, and all animal work was approved by the University of California Los Angeles Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee (ARC).\n1. S. aureus bioluminescent strain choice\nUse the bioluminescent S. aureus strain Xen36 as the inoculum of interest.\n\tNOTE: This strain was derived from the parental strain S. aureus ATCC-49525, which is a clinical isolate from a septic patient. S. aureus Xen36 uniquely utilizes a luxABCDE operon, which is optimized and integrated into the host’s native plasmid.19 As a result, the Xen36 strain is capable of producing a blue-green bioluminescent light with a peak wavelength emission of 490 nm. This emission signal is only produced by living metabolically active bacterial organisms.\n2. Preparation of S. aureus for inoculation\nAdd 200 μg/mL kanamycin to Luria Broth plus 1.5% agar to isolate S. aureus Xen36 from potential contaminants, utilizing the kanamycin resistance gene linked to the lux operon19.\nStreak S. aureus Xen36 bacteria onto tryptic soy agar plates (tryptic soy broth [TSB] plus 1.5% agar) and incubate at 37 °C for 12-16 h.\nIsolate single colonies of S. aureus Xen36 and individually culture in TSB for 12-16 h at 37 °C in a shaking incubator (200 rpm).\nDilute resultant culture at a 1:50 ratio.\nCulture for additional 2 h at 37 °C to isolate midlogarithmic phase bacteria.\nPellet, resuspend, and wash bacteria in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times.",
    "Measure the absorbance at 600 nm. The ideal OD600 is between 0.700 and 0.750 which corresponds to 4x105 CFU/mL. Perform serial dilutions to achieve desired bacterial inoculum (1 x 103  CFU/2 µL).\n\tNOTE: The optimal concentration of Xen36 for the establishment of a chronic infection was found to be 1 x 103 CFU. Lower dosing of bacteria was cleared by the host immune system and higher dosing caused wound breakdown. Wound breakdown does not differentiate between a deep implant infection and a superficial wound infection and is therefore avoided in this model (Figure 1)20.\n3. Mice\nUse 12-week old male C57BL/6J wild-type mice.\nHouse mice in cages with a maximum of 4 at a time.\nKeep water available at all times. Maintain a 12-hour light/dark cycle and do not perform experimentation during the dark phase of the cycle.\nUse alfalfa-free chow for feeding due to potential interference with fluorescent signaling.\nHave research or veterinary staff assess mice daily to ensure the well-being of the animals throughout the entirety of the experiment.\n4. Mouse surgical procedures\nInduce anesthesia by placing mice in an isoflurane (2%) chamber for approximately 5 minutes. Confirm appropriate depth of anesthesia by monitoring respirations to remain rhythmic and slower than when awake and not changing in response to noxious stimuli (e.g., surgical manipulation, toe pinch).\nTransfer anesthetized mice to a preparation station and remove hair from the sacrum to the upper thoracic spine with rodent clippers.\nClean and sterilize the skin with triple washes of alternating betadine solution and isopropyl alcohol.\nTransfer anesthetized and sterilized mice in the prone position to a sterile surgical bed maintaining anesthesia with administration of inhaled isoflurane (2%) via nose cone.",
    "Maximally flex the hips and identify the position of the knee at the level of the spine to approximate the lumbar 4 vertebral body.\nMake a longitudinal 2 cm incision through skin with a 15-blade surgical scalpel.\nPalpate the spinous processes to confirm midline and continue the incision down to bone.\nDissect subperiosteally on the right side of the L4 spinous process, extending laterally to the transverse process.\nPass an absorbable braided suture size 5-0 cephalad and caudad to the L4 body through the fascia and leave open, in preparation for future closure.\nUsing a 25 G spinal needle, ream the spinous process of L4 using a 25 G spinal needle and insert a 0.1 mm diameter, 1 cm long “L-shaped” surgical grade stainless-steel implant along the lamina with the long arm laying cephalad.\nInoculate the implant with 1 x 103 CFUs/2 µL bioluminescent S. aureus Xen36, taking care to ensure all solution contacts the implant.\nWait approximately 10 seconds before tying the previously passed absorbable suture following inoculation to ensure containment of inoculum on the implant.\nClose skin in running fashion with absorbable suture.\nAdminister pain medicine via subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) immediately postop and then every 12 hours for 3 days thereafter.\nRecover mice on a heating pad and monitor for return to normal activity.\nObtain postoperative radiographs to confirm appropriate placement of implant.\n5. Longitudinal In vivo bioluminescence imaging to measure bacterial burden\nAnesthetize mice with inhaled isoflurane (2%). Confirm appropriate depth of anesthesia by monitoring respirations to remain rhythmic and slower than when awake and not changing in response to noxious stimuli (e.g., surgical manipulation, toe pinch).\nRemove hair from the sacrum to the upper thoracic spine with rodent clippers.",
    "Load mice onto field of view of bioluminescent imaging platform to perform in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI)19.\nCapture bioluminescent signal over a 5 min acquisition time. Utilize large binning settings with a 15 cm field of view (B).\nRepeat steps 5.1-5.4 on postoperative days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28, and 35 (or other days based on specific experimental design) to monitor bacterial burden.\nPresent BLI data via color scale and overlay on a grayscale photograph. Isolate a standard ovoid region of interest (ROI) using BLI software to quantify BLI in total flux (photons per second) or mean maximum flux (photons/second/centimeter2/steradian).\n6. Quantify bacteria adherent to implants and surrounding tissue\nEuthanize mice on POD 35 or an alternative post-operative date of choice with exposure to carbon dioxide in accordance with AVMA Guidelines. Confirm euthanasia with secondary cervical dislocation.\nSterilize the dorsal skin according to Step 4.3 and position the mouse prone on a sterile surgical field.\nSharply incise the previous incision using a 15-blade surgical scalpel.\nUse sterile scissors to bluntly dissect to the L4 spinous process and identify the surgical implant.\nUse a needle driver to gently twist and remove the implant from its position in the L4 spinous process.\nUsing sterile forceps and scissors, harvest approximately 0.1 g of spinous process bone and soft tissue immediately surrounding the surgical implant and place in 1 mL of PBS in small conical rhino tube with 4 sharp homogenizing beads.\nRecord weight of soft tissue by weighing conical tube before and after harvest.\nPlace the implant in 0.5 mL of 0.3% Tween-80 in TSB and sonicate for 15 min.\nVortex the resulting implant suspension for 2 min and culture overnight for 12-16 h.",
    "Homogenize the soft tissue and spinous processes previously placed in 1 ml PBS surrounding the implant using homogenizer.\nVortex the resulting soft tissue suspension for 5 min and culture overnight for 12-16 h.\nAfter overnight culture, count CFU from the implant and surrounding tissues, respectively. Express value as total CFU/g harvested for soft tissue and CFU/mL for sonicated implant.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
