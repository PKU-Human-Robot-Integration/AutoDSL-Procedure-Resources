    "RNA extractionStreak out the E. coli strain to be used for RNA extraction on an LB plate and incubate overnight at 37 °C.Select a single colony from the streaked LB agar plate. Inoculate E. coli strain in 3 ml fresh LB medium supplemented with 0.5% galactose, and then grow for 16 h. The next day, assess the bacterial growth by measuring the OD600, usually it is around 4.Dilute the culture in 50 ml pre-warmed (37 °C) LB medium supplemented with 0.5% galactose to give an OD600 reading of about 0.05. Grow the bacterial culture at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. Assess the OD600 till it reaches 0.6, usually it takes 1 h 50 min for the wild type E. coli cell. At this time, the number of cells in 1 ml culture is about 2 x 108.Collect 1 ml cells in a microcentrifuge tube, pellet the cells by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 1 min, 20 °C).Discard the supernatant by pipetting, resuspend the cell pellet in 50 µl protoplasting buffer, and add 5 µl lysozyme (50 mg/ml), mix thoroughly, incubate for 5 min at room temperature.Add 500 µl Trizol, mix thoroughly by vortexing for 15 sec. incubate e the lysed sample for 5 min at room temperature.Add 100 µl chloroform to the lysate, shake vigorously for 15 sec. incubate the resulting mixture at room temperature for 5 min, and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Following the centrifugation process, the mixture separates into 3 layers: a clear upper aqueous layer (containing RNA), an interphase and a red lower organic layer, carefully transfer 250 µl of the upper aqueous phase to a fresh tube.Precipitate RNA from the aqueous phase by mixing 250 µl (equal volume) of isopropanol.",
    "Store samples at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.Decant the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet by vortexing in 1 ml 75% ethanol.Centrifuge the RNA suspension at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the remaining ethanol by repeating the centrifugation process and briefly air-dry the RNA pellet for 5 min (air-dry can be carried on at room temperature).Dissolve RNA in 30 µl RNA storage solution.Measure the concentration of RNA by NanoDrop. Typically, 800-1,000 ng/µl RNA can be isolated from 1 ml of E. coli culture.DNase I and Alkaline Phosphatase treatmentResuspend 25 µg RNA in 1x AP Reaction Buffer to a final volume of 50 µl.Add 3 U of DNase I, and 45 U of Alkaline Phosphatase, 20 U of RNasin® Ribonuclease Inhibitors, mix thoroughly and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.Add 50 µl PCI, mix thoroughly by vortexing for 10 sec.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min.Collect 30 µl of supernatant, and transfer to a Sephadex G-50 column.Centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 2 min, collect the pass through.Measure the RNA concentration by NanoDrop. Typically, 300-400 ng/µl RNA can be collected.LigationDeprotection of 3’-idT RNA oligoCentrifuge the tube briefly. Add 400 µl of deprotection buffer to the tube, vortex for 10 sec and centrifuge for 10 sec.Incubate at 60 °C for 30 min.Perform phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation as follows: add 400 µl of PCI solution to the tube, vortex for 5 sec.Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Carefully remove the 300 µl upper aqueous phase to a new tube.Add 2.5 volume of ice cold 100% ethanol, 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, and vortex to mix thoroughly.Precipitate at -80 °C for 20 min.",
    "Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Decant the supernatant and carefully pipet off the remaining supernatant, wash pellet twice by adding 500 µl ice cold 70% ethanol.Air dry the pellet at room temperature and resuspend in 100 µl of RNase and DNase-free water.Set up a 20 μl reaction as follows: 2 µl 10x RNA ligase buffer 0.25 µl RNasin (40 U/µl)1 μl T4 RNA ligase (5 U/µl)2.5 µg RNA0.5 µl 3’ RACE RNA oligo (100 nM)RNase-free water Incubate at 37 °C for 3 h.The sequence of 3’ RACE RNA oligo is 5’ P.

Thermocycling conditions for PEimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227211846_8055.jpgGel electrophoresisGel castingAssemble the gel according to manufacturer’s description and fix the gel in the gel-casting chamber. Use 0.4 mm thick spacers, glass plates (Inner plate x outer plate (W x H): 31 x 38.5 cm), 4 x 0.4 mm (14 cm) gel comb).Prepare 50 ml of the 8% urea-PAGE solution. Pour the gel immediately using an automatic pipette aid between the two glass plates. Avoid introducing air bubbles. Insert the comb and let the gel polymerize for 60 min. The assembled gel is indicated as in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227212038_4202.jpgFigure 2. A picture of assembled gel in the gel-casting chamber with the automatic pipette aidSet up the electrophoresis apparatus and pre-run the gelDismount the gel from the casting chamber and assemble it to the gel apparatus according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Fill the lower buffer chamber with 1x TBE running buffer, so that the glass plates will be submerged 2-3 cm with the buffer. Fill the upper buffer chamber up to the top of the gel with 1x TBE running buffer.Carefully remove the comb and rinse the wells with running buffer by using a pipette and gel loading tips.Attach the lid of the gel system and plug in the cables to a high voltage power supply. Before loading the samples you have to prerun the gel for at least 30 min to heat up the gel and to remove the remaining urea from the gel. The optimal temperature should be between 45-55 °C. Avoid temperatures higher than 60 °C as bands could smear or the glass plates could crack. Choose a constant watt for the prerun (30 W). The assembled electrophoresis apparatus is indicated as in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227212128_0105.jpgFigure 3. A picture of the assembled electrophoresis apparatusSample preparationAdd 15 µl 2x gel loading mix to 15 µl sample. Denature the sample by heating at 95 °C for 3 min.Load and run the gelRemove the lid and rinse the wells thoroughly as described earlier as urea will leach into the wells.Load 3 µl of samples carefully from the bottom of the wells. Avoid introducing air bubbles. Assemble the lid and run the gel at 30 W to maintain a gel temperature of 55 °C similar to the prerun. Observe the migration of the marker dyes until the dye front reached the lower end of the gel. A run can last 2-4 h.Process the gelRemove the gel cassette from the chamber by loosening the clamps. Pull away the spacers and carefully disassemble the glass plates. If necessary, cut away the upper well containing the gel part.",
    "Cut a Whatman 3MM paper to the same size of the gel, attach it to the gel, and carefully remove the gel from the glass plate. Carefully attach a saran wrap on top of the gel, seal it with scotch tape. A picture of the Whatman 3MM paper cut and saran wrapped is indicated as in Figure 4.Move the sealed gel to the X-ray cassette, put in a single piece of X-ray film, expose at -80 °C for 16 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180227/20180227212258_7929.jpgFigure 4. A picture showing the Whatman 3MM paper cut the same size as the outer plate or gel, saran wrapped sealed with scotch tape placed in the X-ray cassetteAfter the exposure time, take out the cassette from the refrigerator, wait about 1 h until it warms up to the room temperature.Develop the X-ray film in a dark room. Firstly, dilute one-part concentrate of the developer to 4 parts of water. Mix and store it in a bottle. Prepare the fixer in the same way. Then, pour the developer into a container, take the exposed X-ray film out of the cassette, immerse the film into the developer. After several minutes, when the dark bands appear, rinse the film with distilled water and then fix the film in the fixer."
