    "NOTE: Ethics Statement: This protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Animal Care Committee of Simon Fraser University (UACC; permit numbers 1037K-12 and 1060K-03) and is in compliance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care, the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the EEC Council Directive.\n1. Special Considerations\nNOTE: Busulfan is cytotoxic. Handle and dispose according to the material safety data sheet and institutional guidelines.\nPerform all techniques aseptically in a laminar flow hood.\nSterilize instruments prior to use by wrapping in an appropriate packaging material, such as a peel package, and autoclaving.\nWhile the risk for infection is lower with busulfan conditioning compared to irradiation, handle animals only in a laminar flow hood for the first 2 weeks following transplantation.\n2. Conditioning of Recipient Mice\nDilute busulfan to 3 mg/ml with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\n\tNOTE: It is important to make a fresh dilution of busulfan just prior to use each day of injection.\nAdminister 20 mg/kg of diluted busulfan to recipient mice via IP injection daily.\nRepeat daily IP injections of 20 mg/kg busulfan until a total dose of 60-100 mg/kg has been delivered (i.e., for an 80 mg/kg total dose, administer 20 mg/kg of busulfan for 4 consecutive days).\n3. Isolation of Donor Bone Marrow Cells\nNOTE: This protocol has been successfully used for isolating and preparing BM cells from up to 5 donor mice. Typically the cell yield per mouse is approximately 30-40 million BMDCs, which is sufficient to transplant 12-16 recipient mice. If more donor mice are needed the protocol may need to be adjusted accordingly.",
    "Following the last day of busulfan conditioning euthanize a GFP donor mouse (one to six months old) using CO2 (or by other euthanasia procedure accepted at institution). To avoid graft complications use syngeneic donors that are the same sex as the recipients.\nSpray mouse with 70% ethanol. Lift skin at the abdomen and using surgical scissors make an incision through the skin from the abdominal cavity up the leg towards the ankle. Holding the foot, firmly pull the skin from the ankle towards the hip exposing the leg tissue.\nTrim away muscle and fat tissue from the femur to expose the hip joint.\nWhile gently pulling on the foot to extend the leg, press the scissors against the hip joint. Cut just above the head of the femur taking care not to cut the femur itself.\nTo help maintain sterility, hold the leg by the foot and clean any remaining tissue from the bones by rubbing the bone surface with autoclaved tissues.\nSeparate the femur and tibia by cutting through the knee joint and place the femur in a culture dish containing sterile PBS. Incubate on ice.\nRemove and discard the fibula by cutting at the points where the fibula connects to the tibia. Place the tibia in the culture dish with the femur and incubate on ice.\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.7 for the other leg, and if necessary, additional donor mice. Following removal of the bones, sterilize the surgical tools with a hot bead sterilizer or use a new set of sterile tools for the subsequent steps.\nFor the femurs, hold the femur with forceps and using surgical scissors carefully ‘shave’ the distal ends off the bone. Remove as little of the bone as necessary to expose the BM cavity.",
    "Fill a syringe with 3 ml of sterile PBS and attach a 23 G needle. Carefully bore the needle into the BM cavity and flush the BM into a sterile culture dish. Be sure to scrape the medullary cavity with the needle point to ensure removal of all desired cells. Following extraction, ensure that the red BM is no longer visible and the bone now appears white.\nRepeat steps 3.9-3.10 for subsequent femurs, pooling all of the BM in the same culture dish.\nFor the tibiae, hold the tibia with forceps and carefully ‘shave’ the end where the tibia was attached to the knee to expose the BM cavity. Make a second cut along the bone where the visible red BM ends.\nFill a syringe with 3 ml of sterile PBS and attach a 25 G needle. Gently insert the needle into the BM cavity (from the end that was attached to the knee) and flush the BM into the culture dish containing the BM from the femurs. Scrape the walls of the BM cavity with the needle to remove all cells. Following extraction, ensure that the red BM is no longer visible and the bone now appears white.\nRepeat steps 3.12-3.13 for subsequent tibiae, pooling all of the BM in the same culture dish.\nGently triturate the BM with a 1 ml pipette tip to dissociate the cells.\nPass the cell suspension through a 40 μM basket filter into a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube. Rinse the dish with PBS to get any remaining cells and transfer this through the filter into the centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 450 x g at 4 °C. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the pellet in 3 ml of erythrocyte lysing buffer. Incubate on ice for 8.5 min.",
    "Add ~30 ml of sterile PBS to quench the lysing buffer.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 450 x g at 4 °C. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the pellet in 1 ml of sterile PBS. Keep on ice.\nTake a small aliquot of the cell homogenate and dilute with PBS (1:100 for 1 mouse; 1:200 for 2 mice, etc.) to quantify the cell number using a haemocytometer.\nDilute the cell suspension to 8 x 106 cells/ml and incubate on ice until injection.\n4. Bone Marrow Transplantation\nFill a 0.5 ml syringe (with a 28 G insulin needle) with 300 μl of diluted cell suspension for each mouse to be injected. Be sure to remove any air bubbles present in the syringe.\nPlace the mouse cage containing the conditioned recipient mice on a heating pad and allow the tail veins to dilate.\nTake a recipient mouse and place in the restraining device. Wipe the tail with surgical gauze soaked with 70% ethanol.\nFirmly hold the tail and with the bevel up, gently insert the needle into one of the lateral tail veins and inject the cell suspension.\nHold surgical gauze on the injection site until bleeding stops prior to introducing the mouse into a new clean cage.\n5. Estimating the Extent of BM Chimerism\nNOTE: Chimerism levels are typically variable in the peripheral blood at 1 week post-BMT, and as such chimerism levels are normally estimated at least 2 weeks post-BMT. Levels of chimerism should reach >80% GFP+ cells in the peripheral blood within 3-4 weeks post-BMT.\nPrepare FACS buffer (2 mM EDTA + 2% fetal bovine serum in PBS).\n\tNOTE: FACS buffer can be stored at 4 °C for several weeks.",
    "Place the mouse in a restraining tube and shave the fur on the posterior leg to expose the lateral saphenous vein.\nThinly coat the leg with petroleum jelly and pierce the saphenous vein with a 25 G needle.\nCollect approximately 50 μl of blood with a heparin coated capillary tube. Add the blood to a micro-centrifuge tube containing 1 ml of FACS buffer. Mix the tube by inversion and store on ice.\nHold surgical gauze on the injection site until bleeding stops before returning mouse back to the cage.\nCentrifuge the blood samples for 5 min at 900 x g. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the pellet in 500 μl of erythrocyte lysing buffer. Incubate on ice for 8.5 min.\nAdd 1 ml of FACS buffer to quench the lysing buffer.\nCentrifuge the samples for 5 min at 900 x g. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nPerform a second lysis step in 500 μl of erythrocyte lysing buffer. Incubate on ice for 8.5 min.\nAdd 1 ml of FACS buffer to quench the lysing buffer.\nCentrifuge the samples for 5 min at 900 x g. Remove and discard the supernatant. Check that the pellet is now white.\n\tNOTE: If the pellet still appears red, an additional lysis step may be needed before proceeding to the next step.\nRe-suspend the pellet in 1 ml of FACS buffer. Centrifuge the samples for 5 min at 900 x g. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nRe-suspend the pellet in 300 μl of FACS buffer and quantify GFP+ cells using flow cytometry (NOTE: At this point any desired immunostaining of the cells can be performed, using standard techniques, prior to flow cytometric analysis).\nSubscription Required.
