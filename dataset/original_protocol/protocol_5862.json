    "Preparation of fungal and plant cultures and subsequent plant-fungus incubationCulture conditions for Hebeloma cylindrosporumMycelia were grown in glass jars according to the procedure previously described in Bio-protocol (Becquer et al., 2017a).Culture conditions for Pinus pinasterThe procedure for disinfection of seeds, germination and culture conditions have been previously described in Bio-protocol (Becquer et al., 2017b).Culture conditions for Zea mays Sterilize the surface of seeds of maize (Zea mays L.) with a 6% H2O2 solution for 30 min and rinse with sterile distilled water. For germination, put the seeds between two sterile sheets of filter paper previously wetted with deionized sterile water. Incubate for 6 days at 30 °C in the dark for germination. Transfer the seedlings to the test tubes filled with a 0.2 mM CaSO4 solution (35 ml/tube) for 3 days in a growth chamber chamber under 16/8 h light/dark cycle at 25 °C/20 °C, 80%/100% RH, CO2 volume fraction in air of 350 x 10-6 and a photosynthetically active radiation of 400 μmol m-2 sec-1 (400-700 nm). Then, take the test tubes under a flow laminar cabinet to replace the CaSO4 solution by 35 ml of interaction medium (see Recipe 6) in each test tube. Return the test tubes into the growth chamber for an acclimatization period of 24 h.To study the plant roots signals eliciting a specific response of the fungal mycelia, follow the incubation procedure previously described in Becquer et al. (2017b).Fungal sample preparation for in vivo NMR studyPreparation of equipmentA wooden skewer with a hook made with a nichrome wire at its end.A glass capillary for the reference of chemical shift of NMR spectra (16.38 ppm), filled with a solution of methylene diphosphonate (MDP) 50 mM in Tris buffer 30 mM at pH 8.9 (see Video 1 how to prepare the capillary).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.",
    "Making the chemical shift reference with MDP solution  A special homemade NMR tube composed of 3 parts (see Figure 1 and Video 2)An external NMR tube (10 mm diameter).An internal glass cylinder (7 mm diameter) which can be screwed on the external tube.A plastic cap on the top of this device which is bored to allow 3 Teflon tubings to connect the NMR tube to a peristaltic pump permitting the circulation of the oxygenated interaction medium. The inlet tubing extends to the bottom of the NMR tube. The output tubing extends to the top of the mycelia in the NMR tube. The end of the safety output tubing is 3 cm above the mycelia.A string is attached to this device to allow its manual introduction into the hole in the magnet of the NMR spectrometer without using the air-lift system, to avoid friction between the 3 PVC tubings and magnet walls.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180813/20180813002101_5044.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of the device used for in vivo 31P NMR measurements<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Experimental set-up for in vivo NMR measurements   A system that allows the circulation of the oxygenated interaction medium into the above-described tube, avoiding anoxia of the mycelia during the NMR data acquisition.It consists of:The 3 Teflon tubings extending from the NMR tube that are connected to a peristaltic pump through PVC tubings.The inlet tubing supplies the interaction medium from a glass bottle (2,000 ml), in which oxygen is bubbled from a compressed O2 gas cylinder, to the NMR tube.The output tubing collects the medium which has oxygenated the mycelia to another originally empty glass bottle (2,000 ml).In case of dysfunction of the normal output system, a safety output tubing should avoid any leakage in the magnet hole.",
    "Introduction of the fungal mycelia in the in vivo device NMR tube (see Video 2)Remove the fungal mycelia from the flask, or from the syringe containing interaction medium (see Becquer et al., 2017b), let the solution drip off gently and put it on a filter paper with the help of spatula or tweezers.Put the fungal mycelia at the bottom of the NMR tube, as gently as possible, using the spatula first and then the flat side of the wooden skewer. With Hebeloma cylindrosporum, three mycelial samples obtained in the above-described culture conditions are necessary for a reasonable signal to noise 31P-NMR of 1 h of fully relaxed data acquisition.Put the chemical shift reference capillary at the bottom center of the NMR tube with the help of the wooden skewer and the hook.Screw the internal tube on the NMR tube. If the reference capillary is not well positioned inside the internal tube, start again and move it with the hook to set it up in the middle of the internal tube.Roll a silicone film on the plastic cap to ensure that the oxygenated perfusion solution will not leak off the NMR tube. Starting the oxygenating perfusion system (adapted from Lee and Ratcliffe, 1983)Start the oxygen bubbling in the glass bottle containing the interaction medium connected to the NMR tube via the inlet tubing.Adjust the flow controlled by the peristaltic pump of the inlet, output and safety output tubings to 9 ml min-1 for each of them.Introduce manually and slowly the NMR tube with the 3 tubings in the magnet hole of the NMR spectrometer with the help of the string. Fungal sample preparation for in vitro NMR study (adapted from Roby et al., 1987)Freeze the mycelia with liquid nitrogen.Store them at -80 °C before extraction.",
    "For each 31P-NMR measurement, thaw 6 frozen mycelia at 4 °C and crush them with 1 ml of 70% (v/v) perchloric acid containing sodium vanadate 10 mM.Remove the particulate matter and neutralize the perchloric acid in the sample (adapted from Aubert et al., 1996):Centrifuge the thick suspension at 10,000 x g for 10 min to discard particulate matter in the pellet.Transfer the supernatant into a 50 ml Falcon tube, add a pH electrode and neutralize the solution by very slowly adding a solution of 2 M KHCO3, allowing foam to subside, stop when a pH of 6.5 is obtained.Centrifuge again at 10,000 x g for 10 min to remove KClO4 in the pellet.Freeze dry the supernatant and store it at -80 °C.For the NMR measurement, the freeze-dried material is redissolved in 2 ml MOPS 40 mM (non-adjusted pH). Then add 0.2 ml EDTA 100 mM. Adjust the pH to 7.8 with KOH 1 N.Add NaN3 to a final concentration of 100 mg ml-1 to avoid microbial degradation.Add D2O (final concentration 10%) for the field frequency lock of the NMR signal. 31P-NMR data acquisitionRecord NMR spectra with a Varian UNITY INOVA 500 MHz operating at 202.4 MHz for 31P equipped with a 10 mm broadband probe operating at 25 °C.For the in vivo experiments use the following parameters for acquisition conditionsIt was not necessary to optimize shims considering the broadness of 31P NMR signals in in vivo experiments. Carry out the experiments without a lock signal.90° radio frequency pulses angle; spectral width = 20,000 Hz; acquisition time = 0.4 sec; 31P frequency offset = 3,900 Hz. No decoupling (not useful considering the broadness of 31P-NMR peaks in vivo NMR experiments: 1H decoupling does not affect the linewidths of peaks).",
    "20 sec inter-scan delay (5 times the spin-lattice relaxation time T1) giving a fully relaxed spectrum (Quiquampoix et al., 1993). This is a very important parameter for the quantitative analysis of the chemical metabolites identified in the 31P-NMR spectrum. A much lower inter-scan delay does not allow a real quantification.180 scans giving a total accumulation time of 1 h.Apodization of the spectra using a 10 Hz exponential function and zero filling to 16 K points.Phase and baseline correction.Note: Examples of in vivo spectra obtained with this protocol can be seen in Torres-Aquino et al. (2017).For the in vitro experiments use the following parameters for acquisition conditions10% of D2O in the mycelial sample as a lock signal.90° radio frequency pulses angle; spectral width = 9,600 Hz; acquisition time = 0.84 sec; 1H decoupling during the acquisition time using a Waltz-16 pulse sequence at a field strength of 4 KHz. 31P frequency offset = 4,900 Hz; 1H frequency offset = 170 Hz.4 sec inter-scan delay. In these experiments, the scope is the identification of the phosphorylated fungal metabolites based on the signal chemical shift, without the need of quantification. If quantification is required, use the 20 sec inter-scan delay as for in vivo studies.A sufficient number of accumulations for an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.Apodization of the spectra using a 2 Hz exponential function and zero filling to 16 K pointsPhase and baseline correction.Note: Examples of in vitro spectra obtained with this protocol can be seen in Torres-Aquino et al. (2017)."
