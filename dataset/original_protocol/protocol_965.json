    "This protocol requires a database of gene families that includes all predicted proteins of the species of interest \\(e.g. _Brugia timori_), as well as _C. elegans_, _S. mansoni_, human, and zebrafish. This could be built for example using the Ensembl Compara pipeline \\(Vilella _et al._ 2009), which identifies gene families and orthologues in those families.\n**Step 1: Protein Names**\n1. For each predicted gene in the genome of interest \\(e.g. _B. timori_), we first identify its one-to-one or many-to-one orthologues in human, zebrafish, _Drosophila melanogaster_, _Caenorhabditis elegans_, and _Schistosoma mansoni_ \\(e.g. many- _B. timori_ -to-one- C. _elegans_ orthologues). The orthologues are identified based on the in-house database of gene families.\n  \n2. Check whether the predicted gene of interest \\(e.g. in _B. timori_) has a human, zebrafish, _Drosophila melanogaster_, _Caenorhabditis elegans_, or _Schistosoma mansoni_ orthologue with a manually curated protein name in UniProt \\(Bairoch & Apweiler 2000), or a  _S. mansoni_ orthologue with a manually curated protein name in GeneDB \\(Logan-Klumpler _et al._ 2012). For this, if Ensembl accessions were used in the in-house database of gene families, the correspondence between UniProt accessions and Ensembl accessions can be downloaded from the UniProt website.\n  \n3. Taking the orthologues with curated names found in \\(2) above, in order of preference, select an orthologue from: _C. elegans_, _S. mansoni_, human, _D. melanogaster_ and then zebrafish. If an orthologue with a manually curated protein name from the most preferred species \\(_C. elegans_) is not found, check the second-most preferred species \\(_S. mansoni_), and so on. \n  \n4. Taking the selected orthologue found in \\(3) above, if it is from UniProt the UniProt ‘recommended name’ \\(RN) of the orthologue is used as the protein name, if it is from GeneDB the GeneDB  ‘product description’ is used as the protein name.",
    "5. If no orthologue with a manually curated protein name is identified in step \\(2) above, then check if the predicted gene of interest has an orthologue with a non-curated protein name \\(i.e. from a TrEMBL entry; Bairoch & Apweiler, 2000).\n  \n6. Transfer the selected protein name from \\(4) or \\(5) above \\(e.g. ‘caveolin’) to the predicted gene of interest \\(e.g. in _B. timori_) and record the UniProt/GeneDB accession of the source protein, along with the evidence code ECO:0000265 \\(‘sequence orthology evidence used in automatic assertion’), from the Evidence Code Ontology \\(ECO; <a href=\"http://www.evidenceontology.org\">www.evidenceontology.org</a>).  If several genes in the species of interest \\(e.g. _B. timori_) are assigned the same protein name \\(for example, because of many-to-one orthology to the same _C. elegans_ gene), number them  \\(e.g. ‘caveolin-1’, ‘caveolin-2’, etc.) to ensure they are given unique names.\n  \n7. To identify InterPro \\(Hunter _et al._ 2012) domains in the proteins of the query species \\(e.g. _B. timori_), run InterProScan \\(Quevillon _et al._ 2005) version 5.0.7 on the protein sequences of all predicted genes for that species.\n  \n8. If a particular query protein \\(e.g. from _B. timori_) is not assigned any protein name based on its orthologues, then assign a protein name based on InterPro domains in the protein \\(e.g. ‘ankyrin repeat and SAM-domain-containing protein’). Note the InterPro accession\\(s) of the source domains, and record the evidence code for the protein name as ECO:0000259 \\('match to InterPro signature evidence used in automatic assertion').\n  \n9. If a query protein \\(e.g. from _B. timori_) is not assigned a protein name based on either orthologues or InterPro domains, name it ‘Hypothetical protein’.\n  \n10. Add the protein names to the protein fasta file headers for the species of interest \\(e.g. _B. timori_). \n  \n**Step 2: GO Terms**",
    "1. For each predicted gene in the genome of interest \\(e.g. _B. timori_), we first identify its one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many orthologues in human, zebrafish, _Drosophila melanogaster_, and _Caenorhabditis elegans_. The orthologues are identified based on the in-house database of gene families.\n  \n2. Download manually curated GO annotations for human, zebrafish, _C. elegans_, and _D. melanogaster_ from the Gene Ontology website \\(Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010), and filter them to exclude annotations not based on experimental evidence \\(i.e. only those with evidence codes IDA/IEP/IGI/IMP/IPI should be retained), annotations with a ‘NOT’ qualifier, and annotations to the GO:0005515 \\(‘protein binding’) term, following the criteria used by the Compara project for projecting GO terms to vertebrate orthologues \\(Vilella _et al._ 2009). \n  \n3. Download the GO hierarchy from the Gene Ontology website \\(Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010).\n  \n4. Check whether the predicted gene of interest \\(e.g. in _B. timori_) has human, zebrafish, _Drosophila melanogaster_, or _Caenorhabditis elegans_ orthologues with manually curated GO terms.\n  \n5. Taking the orthologues and their manually curated GO terms from \\(4) above, take each pair of orthologues \\(A, B) from two different species \\(e.g. a _C. elegans_ orthologue and a _D. rerio_ orthologue, but not two _C. elegans_ orthologues), and use a breadth-first search algorithm to find the last common ancestors of their GO terms in the GO hierarchy. For example, if A has GO terms \\{A1, A2, A3} and B has GO terms \\{B1, B2}, we find the last common ancestors of A1+B1, A1+B2, A2+B1, A2+B2, A3+B1, and A3+B2. The GO terms assigned to the \\(e.g. _B. timori_) query gene are the union of the last common ancestors of GO terms for all pairs of orthologues from two different species.",
    "Figure 2 shows an example of such a breadth-first search, where the nodes N1-N14 represent nodes in the GO hierarchy \\(e.g. N14=GO:0030336, etc.). If two orthologues in different species, gene 1 and gene 2, have GO terms \\{N1, N10} and \\{N2, N11} respectively, then the ancestors of N1 and N2 are \\{N5, N7}, the ancestors of N1 and N11 are \\{N14}, the ancestors of N10 and N11 are \\{N13}, and the ancestors of N10 and N2 are \\{N14}. Therefore the union of all ancestors is \\{N5, N7, N13, N14}. \n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6591/original/Figure2.gif?1523703153\"><img src=\"https://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/6591/original/Figure2.gif?1523703153\"></a>\n6. Taking the set of GO terms assigned in \\(5) above, remove any GO term from this set that is an ancestor \\(in the GO hierarchy) of another term in the set. For example, in the example in Figure 2, we remove N14 as it is an ancestor of N13, leaving the final set of last common ancestors of genes 1 and 2 to be \\{N5, N7, N13}.\n  \n7. For each GO term in \\(6), note the UniProt accession of the source \\(orthologue) protein, and record the evidence code for the GO term as IEA \\(‘inferred from electronic annotation’).\n  \n8. Assign GO terms of the three possible types \\(molecular function, cellular component and biological process) to each query protein \\(e.g. from _B. timori_) in this way \\(using \\(1)-\\(7) above).\n  \n9. For each query protein \\(e.g. from _B. timori_), also identify GO terms using InterproScan \\(Jones _et al._ 2014), which identifies InterPro \\(Hunter _et al._ 2012) domains in the protein and maps GO terms to the domains \\(using InterPro2GO). Note the InterPro accession\\(s) of the source domains, and record the evidence code for the GO terms  as IEA."
