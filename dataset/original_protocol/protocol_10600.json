    "1. Mica and Slides Preparation\nPlace No. 1½ (0.17 mm) coverslips into staining rack.\nSonicate for 30 min in 2% detergent at 60 °C.\nWash 20 times with deionized water.\nRemove slides using forceps and blow dry using compressed air or nitrogen.\nCut mica sheet into 10 x 10 mm square pieces using scissors or razor blade.\nCut each mica piece into 2-3 thinner leaflets using razor blade.\n\tNOTE: This step requires use of sharp blade.\n2. Mica Assembly and Chamber Mounting\nClean microscopic glass slide with ethanol.\nGlue leaflet of mica cut in step 1.6 to glass slide using optical adhesive. Low viscosity adhesive is advised to better spread the drop and glue the mica.\nCure under UV lamp, 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Adhesive is cured by UV light with maximum absorption in the range of 350 to 380nm and the recommended energy required for full cure is 4.5 J/cm2. However, different light sources can be used for this step (see materials provided by adhesive supplier).\nExpose a clean mica surface by removing the first few layers with Scotch tape.\nPlace small drop (~20 μm) of optical adhesive onto the mica surface.\n\tNOTE: At this step, high viscosity adhesive with low autofluorescence level is advised. Our experience showed that using combination of low (step 2.2) and high viscosity adhesives increases significantly effectiveness of mica splitting (step 2.7).\nGently place freshly cleaned coverslip onto the drop of adhesive, avoiding air bubbles, let settle for 1 min.\nCure under UV lamp, 10 min.\n\tNOTE: after this step, the sandwich of glass slide, mica and coverslip can be stored for a relatively long period of time (up to few weeks). Proceed to the next step just before the actual SLB preparation, to make sure the mica surface is fresh.",
    "NOTE: Adhesive is cured by UV light with maximum absorption in the range of 350 to 380nm and the recommended energy required for full cure is 4.5J/cm2. However, different light sources can be used for this step (see materials provided by adhesive supplier).\nUsing an exacto knife, gently dismount the coverslip from side glass slide as shown in the video. In most cases, a thin and flat layer of mica will remain attached to the coverslip. Mica attached to glass slide can be reused (repeat from step 2.4).\nCheck the surface quality by naked eye or under a dissecting microscope, to make sure that mica layer is still glued to the coverslip and was not removed completely during splitting in step 2.8. Making a small scratch with a forceps or dissecting needle will help to distinguish between the adhesive which has a detectably different consistency from mica.\nRemove rubber seal from a 1.5 ml vial cap and glue the cap upside down to the surface using optical adhesive or nail polish, and cure with UV lamp, or let air dry 10 min, respectively.\n\tNOTE: If the sample is prepared for simultaneous optical (TIRFM or confocal) with AFM imaging, a 1.5 ml vial cap might be too small to mount the AFM head on the microscope stage. In that case, the cap might be substituted by any plastic O-ring with a bigger diameter, suitable for AFM head mounting. In case when the experiment requires removing the cap without damaging the mica surface, silicone grease can be used instead of glue or nail polish.\n3. Supported Lipid Bilayer (SLB) Formation\nPlace freshly prepared liposome solution into chamber with surface. The minimum volume required for SLB formation is ~30 μl.",
    "NOTE: For more details on the liposome and SLB formation, refer to published protocols, such as such as Bag et al., 201415.\nProceed with SLB formation using desired protocol. During incubation and imaging, the chamber can be placed in a heat-block or heated microscope stage to maintain temperature required to keep the lipids being used above their melting temperature.\nSubscription Required.
