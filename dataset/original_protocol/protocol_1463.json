Acid treatment for removal on non-EV related proteins, in particular caseins\nThis figure outlines the two treatments performed on milk to remove non-EV related proteins, especially caseins as they can act as contaminant proteins due to their abundance and overlapping sizes. Both SM and IMF were either left untreated or treated with 6 N acetic acid (AA) or Hydrochloric acid (HCl). Post-acid treatment, for removal of the precipitates, samples were centrifuged on a benchtop centrifuge and further used in a 3-step filtration process, as shown in the figure. Of note, the non-treated samples were filtered only using the filter paper as filtration using syringe filters was not possible due to clogging of filters by milk proteins.\nNote: Commercially available SM and powdered IMF were used in this study. Fresh SM and freshly prepared IMF samples were always used for EV separation steps. The preparation of IMF from its powder form was performed exactly as recommended by its manufacturer, to replicate the product that would be prepared to feed to infants. Specifically, in the example shown in this paper, 4.4 g of IMF powder was mixed with 30 mL of water that had been freshly boiled and then allowed to cool naturally. When prepared following the instruction on the container, the IMF was described by its manufacturer as a ‘nutritionally complete’ breast milk substitute with 0.7 mg per 100 mL feed iron content.",
    "Critical: Care should be taken when dissolving the IMF; only warm, not boiling, filtered water should be used for reconstituting the powder. We suggest following the manufacturer's recommendation when reconstituting any form of spray-dried IMF/milk to successfully separate EVs -as they would exist- from the source. Sterile tubes and filtered deionised water should be used for all steps.\nFor the untreated samples, centrifuge 50 mL of SM or IMF at 2,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Carefully collect the supernatant and discard the pellet containing any fat globules or debris. In case non-defatted milk is used as a starting material, centrifuge milk at 6,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove fats and then proceed with the supernatant and centrifuge at 2,000 g for 20 min at 4°C.\nPass this supernatant through WhatmanTM Grade 1 filter paper (diameter 150 mm) using a glass funnel. Fold the filter paper in half and, then again, fold it to form a 90° center angle. Place the folded filter paper on one side in the funnel and open one layer on the other side to form a funnel. Carefully pour the supernatant and collect the filtrate in a fresh tube at the bottom of the funnel (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nThe filtrate obtained from untreated SM is designated as SM_NT and the filtrate from untreated IMF is designated as IMF_NT.\nPreparation of acetic acid-treated milk samples\nTiming: 90 min\nThis part of the protocol is presented in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1007-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Three-step filtration of milk whey\n(A) Milk whey separated from caseins and filtrated using Whatman filter paper.\n(B) 0.45 μm syringe filter is used to filtrate milk whey.\n(C) 0.2 μm syringe is used to achieve total remotion of casein residues.\n(D) 20 mL of filtrated milk whey is transferred in a falcon tube\nThe acetic acid treatment of SM and IMF was performed based on a protocol published by Somiya et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] but with extra filtration steps as described in steps 4–6 below.\nCritical: For use of acid in this step, perform the task under a fume hood.\nTo adjust the pH of milk to 4.6, 6 N acetic acid was used. A standard pH meter (Mettler Toledo) was used to measure the pH. Acid is added to milk drop-by-drop, making sure the pH is changed in a controlled manner while stirring the milk sample continuously (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nOnce the pH is adjusted to 4.6, the sample is left for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C), followed by centrifugation (Sorvall ST 8 R benchtop centrifuge) at 5,000 g for 30 min at 4°C (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nA 3-step filtration, using WhatmanTM Grade 1 filter paper (diameter 150 mm), 0.45-μm and 0.22-μm membrane syringe filters, was performed (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The filtrate from SM is designated as SM_AA and that from IMF is designated as IMF_AA.\nCAUTION: Store the resultant whey at 4°C until further use, do not freeze.\nPreparation of isoelectric precipitated milk samples\nTiming: 90 min",
    "This part of the protocol is presented in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nIsoelectric precipitation (IP) was performed on SM and IMF based on the protocol published by Yamauchi et al.(2018) with modifications as described in steps 7–9 below.\nCritical: For use of acid in this step, perform the task under a fume hood.\nDilute the SM and IMF samples with an equal volume of distilled water and adjust the pH to 4.6 with 6 N HCl to precipitate caseins, following the details mentioned in point 4 above (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nThe pH adjusted milk is placed on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 5,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Whey is filtered as described above (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nThe filtrate from SM is designated as SM_IP and that from IMF is designated as IMF_IP (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCAUTION: Store the resultant whey at 4°C until further use, do not freeze.\nSeparation of EVs by ultracentrifugation\nThe outline of the ultracentrifugation steps is graphically presented in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1007-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Ultracentrifugation steps to separate EVs",
    "This figure outlines the ultracentrifugation techniques used for each sample as well as outlines the volumes required and the time required to carry out the process. Untreated, AA and IP treated milk samples were further subjected to either Gradient ultracentrifugation (GUC) or Differential ultracentrifugation (DUC). GUC required 2.33 mL of the sample that was mixed with Optiprep to obtain a 40% solution. This was layered at the bottom of a 17 mL tube followed by 30%, 20% and 10% solution of Optiprep solution in PBS. PBS was layered on the top of the tube and the tube was ultracentrifuged at 186,000 g for 18 h at 4°C. On the other hand, for DUC, 38 mL of sample was loaded in a polypropylene tube that was centrifuged at 12,000 g, 35,000 g, 75,000 g, 100,000 g and 200,000 g for 90 min each at 4°C. The final pellet was collected and stored for further use.\nCritical: The following steps include the use of ultracentrifugation and so proper care related to the use of an ultracentrifuge should be taken. The rotors are required to be stored at 4°C, as per the manufacturer’s suggestion. After filling up the tubes, a microbalance was used to balance the tubes. All the tubes were balanced to achieve the same weight ± 0.01 g/mL.\nGradient ultracentrifugation\nTiming: 20 h\nGradient ultracentrifugation (GUC) using an SW Type 32.1 Ti rotor in Optima XPN-100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) is performed using iodixanol solution OptiPrep™ (60% (w/v)) following the bottom-up technique.\nA 40% (w/v) bottom layer is made by diluting 60% Optiprep solution with each sample type (4.67 mL Optiprep + 2.33 mL sample = 7 mL).\nTransfer the 7 mL of the solution into the 17 mL polypropylene tube carefully, placing the tube in an upright position.",
    "After the transfer of the solution, place the tube at an approximately 70° angle to form the discontinuous gradient layers (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1007-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Preparation of the Optiprep density gradient\n(A) 2.5 mL of 30% Optiprep is carefully loaded on top of a 40% layer (60% Optiprep + 2.33 mL milk whey.\n(B) Ultraclear centrifuge tube is gently disposed of at approximately 70° angle to facilitate the loading of the layers.\n(C) The density gradient is prepared.\nCritical: The formation of the discontinuous gradient layering is done carefully without disturbing the layers formed inside the tube. For this, the respective iodixanol solution was added drop by drop, using a pipette.\nLayer the discontinuous gradient with 30% (w/v), 20% (w/v), 10% (w/v) and 5% (w/v) solutions of iodixanol (from bottom to top), that have been made by diluting a stock solution of OptiPrep (60% (w/v)) with sterile PBS (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nCritical: If multiple gradient tubes are being prepared, store the prepared tubes either at 4°C or on ice until the other tubes are ready.\nAfter the gradient tube preparation, carefully transfer the tubes into their respective rotor holders.\nThe holders are weighed to balance all the tubes to the same weight ± 0.01 g/mL using a microbalance.\nCritical: The parameters set for the ultracentrifugation step should be followed. Any changes to the step may lead to inaccurate separation based on density. Also, care should be taken so as the acceleration and deceleration (before and after centrifugation, respectively) of the ultracentrifuge do not occur abruptly, which may lead to the disruption of the separated layers.\nCarefully place the holders in the pre-cooled rotor and set the ultracentrifuge with the following parameters on the software:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1007_1.csv\nUltracentrifugation is performed following the above-mentioned parameters.",
    "Critical: After the centrifugation step, 1 mL fractions are collected; a total of 17 tubes corresponding to 17 mL volume of the polypropylene tubes. The collection of the 1 mL fractions is carried out carefully without disrupting the layers formed. The collection of the fractions should always be done from top to bottom and the sample should carefully be pipetted out from the centre of the liquid surface using a P1000 pipette.\nPost 18 h of centrifugation, 1 mL fractions are collected, starting from the top to bottom.\nRefractive index determination and pooling based on densities\nTiming: 60 min\nUsing a hand-held Pal-Ri Refractometer, the refractive index (RI) of each fraction is determined.\nFirst, the refractometer is zeroed using 300 μL of distilled water.\nOnce calibrated, 300 μL of each fraction is placed on the refractometer for each reading.\nResolution is displayed to four decimal places.\nBased on the measured RI, the following equation is used to calculate the density:\nDensity = 3.3411 × RI – 3.4584\nFollowing previously published research (Admyre et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Zonneveld et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), and based on the calculated densities, fractions are pooled as follows:\npool 1 (fractions with density ≤ 1.00 g/mL)\npool 2 (fractions with densities between 1.10 to 1.20 g/mL)\npool 3 (fractions with density ≥ 1.20 g/mL)\nCritical: After the pooling of the fractions based on densities, the iodixanol solution is washed by adding a PBS plus centrifugation step. In separate polypropylene tubes, the pooled fractions and sterile PBS are added to bring the volume up to 38 mL. The tubes are balanced to a similar weight ± 0.01 g/mL. The balanced tubes are placed in a pre-cooled SW Type 32 Ti swinging bucket rotor and ultracentrifugation is performed using the following parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1007_2.csv",
    "After centrifugation, all the liquid is carefully pipetted out and discarded and the viscous pellet at the bottom is resuspended with 1 mL of sterile PBS.\nCAUTION: Store the resultant EV-enriched suspension at −80°C until further use.\nDifferential ultracentrifugation\nTiming: 8 h\nCritical: The following steps include the use of ultracentrifugation and so proper care related to the use of ultracentrifuge should be taken. The rotors are required to be stored at 4°C, as per the manufacturer’s suggestion. After filling up the tubes, a microbalance is used to balance the tubes. All the tubes are balanced to achieve the same weight ± 0.01 g/mL.\nDifferential ultracentrifugation (DUC) separation of EVs from the untreated or treated SM and IMF samples is performed based on a protocol previously published by Benmoussa et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], with modifications as described below in steps 27–29.\nSamples are filled into 38 mL open-top polypropylene tubes and balanced to their weight (± 0.01 g/mL difference) before placing into the rotor specific holder.\nThe weighed tubes are carefully placed into the pre-cooled SW Type 32 Ti swinging bucket rotor and ultracentrifugation is performed using the following parameters:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1007_3.csv\nAfter each centrifugation step, the pellet (denoted as 12 K, 35 K, 75 K, 100 K or 200 K, respectively) is collected, resuspended in 1 mL PBS and stored at −80°C for potential further analysis, whereas the supernatant is poured in a fresh tube and centrifuged at the next speed.\nCAUTION: Store the resultant pellets at −80°C until further use."
