    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConstruct plasmid library\nTiming: 4 days\nAfter purchasing the synthetic oligo library, the plasmid library is constructed by PCR amplification, restriction digestion, and ligation to the background plasmid (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]), followed by bacteria transformation.\nPCR amplify the oligo library using the designed common primers (see section “design synthetic oligonucleotide library[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]”, step 11f).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2736_19.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2736_20.csv\nNote: The volume and cycles of PCR need to be adjusted based on the library size. The number of DNA molecules in the PCR product should be more than 0.1–1 × 1010 fold of the library size. For oligonucleotides 100 bp in length, we expect to get ∼7.3 μg of DNA (1.4 × 1014 molecules) from the reaction above, which is sufficient for a library with 100 k types of oligos.\nNote: Bias may be generated during PCR, so start with maximum amount of oligonucleotide library and minimize the PCR cycle number.\nConfirm the size of PCR products using 3% TAE agarose gel.\nPurify and concentrate the PCR product using Amicon 30K filter by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. Use 1× NEB Buffer r2.1 to wash and concentrate the PCR sample in this step.\nNote: Due to the short size of the oligonucleotide library, using the Amicon filter can generate higher yield than other PCR purification kit.\nAdjust the purified PCR product to 10 ng/μL in 1× NEB Buffer r2.1 and digest with BbsI at 37°C 12–16 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2736_21.csv\nCheck the level of digestion on a 3% agarose gel. If not complete, add more BbsI and digest for a longer time.\nPurify 60bp band from a 3% gel using GeneJET gel extraction kit (Thermo Fisher, K0691).",
    "Note: The purification yield typically is around 20%. Add Ethidium bromide to the buffer near positive electrode if you need to run the gel for a long time. If possible, use blue light or UV with long wavelength (365 nm) when doing gel extraction to avoid DNA damage.\nDigest the plasmid backbone at 37°C for 12–16 h and treat the digested plasmid with Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP). Check the digestion of plasmid on a 1% agarose gel.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2736_22.csv\nHeat inactivate enzymes at 80°C for 2 min, let the sample cool down, and then perform solution purification using the E.Z.N.A.® Cycle Pure Kit.\nLigate the digested PCR product and plasmid at 16°C for 12–16 h. Include a control with no insert to estimate the amount of self-ligation products.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2736_23.csv\nPurify the ligation products using the E.Z.N.A.® Cycle Pure Kit and store at −20°C for the next step. The final volume is 30 μL.\nCritical: This cleanup step is very important. Direct transformation with the ligation product causes low transformation efficiency because the salt concentration in the solution will influence electroporation.\nPre-warm NEB 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium at 37°C, and chill 1 mm electroporation cuvettes on ice (for Eppendorf Eporator or BIO-RAD MicroPulser).\nThaw NEB 10-beta electrocompetent E. coli on ice, and then add 2.5 μL of purified ligation product per 25 μL of competent cells.\nNote: Each 25 μL of electroporation reaction will produce approximately 2–3 × 105 colonies. Adjust your reaction volume based on the complexity of the library. For a library with 10 k different oligos, for example, we want to get more than 500 k colonies, which require two to three 25 μL electroporation reactions.\nAdd 25 μL of well-mixed DNA/ E. coli mixture to each chilled cuvette. Do this carefully to avoid the formation of bubbles.",
    "Perform electroporation at 1.7 kV for 5 ± 0.2 ms using Eppendorf Eporator.\nAfter electroporation, immediately add 1 mL pre-warmed SOC medium to each electroporation reaction, transfer into a culture tube, and then shake at 37°C incubator for 1 h.\nSerial dilute (1:100 and 1:1000) the cell culture above with SOC, and plate 100 μL of each dilution onto Ampicillin LB plates to count transformed cells. Dilute the rest of the culture to an optical density at 660 nm (OD660) of ∼0.07 in Ampicillin LB medium and shake for 12–16 h at 37°C.\nNote: Use the colony number above to estimate the total number of colonies in the reaction. For example, if 20 colonies are obtained on the 1:1000 dilution plate, the total number of colonies is 200 × total volume in μL.\nUse 80% of the culture to perform a maxiprep to get the plasmid library. Mix the rest of the culture with an equal volume of glycerol and freeze at −80°C.\nNote: In case bacteria carrying different plasmid sequences have different growth rates, long-term propagation of the bacterial culture can increase bias among sequences in the library. Therefore, avoid multiple passages of this bacteria stock.\nTest the plasmid library. If you can find a common digestion site inside all synthetic oligonucleotides that does not exist in the background plasmid, treat the plasmid library with the corresponding restriction enzyme and run an agarose gel to check.\nNote: In our design, we digested plasmids using BamHI. We expect to see one linearized DNA band, indicating that there is little contamination from the backbone plasmid and / or self-ligated plasmids.",
    "Test the diversity of the plasmid library. Use the plasmid library as template, PCR across the ligated oligo region, and perform amplicon sequencing using NextSeq (Illumina) with a total sequencing depth of 500 × N (number of oligos). See below for detailed amplicon sequencing protocol.\nNote: Library synthesis, amplification, and cloning will generate bias among sequences. As a result, some designed sequences can be relatively enriched or depleted in the library. It is therefore useful to check the diversity of the plasmid library to ensure that most oligo sequences have similar representations. In our experience, this is usually the case.\nYeast library construction\nTiming: 3.5 days\nThe number of yeast colonies should be more than 50 times the complexity of the plasmid library. Integration of the plasmid library into yeast can be done through electroporation or chemical transformation. The chemical transformation requires 2–3 times more DNA than electroporation. However, some mutant strains with poor fitness cannot survive electroporation, and chemical transformation is the only option.\nElectroporation.\nLinearize the plasmid library by digesting inside a sequence fragment that has a homolog in the yeast genome.\nNote: In our case, we cut the plasmid inside the CLN2 degron sequence at 25°C for 12–16 h in a 250 μL reaction containing 1× Cutsmart buffer, 200 ng/μL of plasmid, and 0.4 U/μL of ApaI.\nPurify the linearized library using the E.Z.N.A.® Cycle Pure Kit. Final concentration should be∼200 ng/μL.\nInoculate the yeast background strain (See “construct background strains[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]” section) in 80 mL of YEPD medium and shake for 12–16 h at 30°C.\nAfter incubation for 12–16 h, dilute the culture to OD660 0.1 in 1 L of YEPD.\nWhen the diluted yeast culture grows to OD660 0.7, Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 8 min at 20°C–22°C.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in 100 mL of 1× Lithium acetate (LiOAc)/TE and shake at 175 rpm for 45 min at 30°C in a water bath shaker.\nAdd 2.5 mL of 1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) to the suspension and shake at 175 rpm for another 15 min at 30°C.\nAdd 400 mL of ice-chilled water and harvest cells. Cells need to be kept on ice until step m. All reagents used after this step are pre-chilled on ice.\nWash cell pellet sequentially with 250 mL of ddH2O, 30 mL of 1 M sorbitol, and 30 mL of 1 M sorbitol by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 4 min at 4°C. Resuspend in 0.5 mL of 1 M sorbitol.\nCritical: the washes are critical because any salt left in the cell suspension will significantly reduce the electroporation efficiency.\nMix each 40 μL of competent yeast cells (∼6 × 108 cells) with 100 ng linearized DNA.\nChill the mixture on ice for ∼5 min, and transfer to a 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette (200 μL for each cuvette, max capacity 400 μL).\nNote: Transformation with 1 L yeast culture will typically result in 16 electroporation reactions.\nPerform electroporation with 1.5 kV voltage using Eppendorf Eporator. After electroporation, check the time constant (usually between 4–5 ms).\nGently resuspend cells with ice-cold SCD-Ura containing 1 M sorbitol (2 mL for each cuvette) and transfer them into a 125 mL flask. Combine cells from all cuvettes.\nTake out 100 μL of the culture above and serial dilute (1:10 and 1:100) using SCD-Ura with 1 M sorbitol.\nSpread each dilution on selection plate (in our case, SCD-Ura with 1 M sorbitol) to check transformation efficiency.",
    "Note: Use the colony number growing on the plate to estimate the total number of yeast colonies. We normally get 0.5–1 × 105 colonies from 1 L of yeast culture.\nShake the rest of cells in the flask at 50 rpm in a water bath shaker for ∼3 h at 30°C to allow the reformation of the cell wall.\nCollect the cells and inoculate them into SCD-Ura liquid media to an OD660 = ∼0.1, culture for two days or until the cell culture density is saturated. Afterwards, collect cells by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 8 min at 20°C–22°C, mix the cell pellet with equal volume of 30% glycerol, and freeze the cells at −80°C.\nChemical transformation.\nLinearize and purify the plasmid library (20 μg) using the same protocol as 19a & b.\nThe background strain is inoculated in 50 mL YEPD medium and incubated with shaking for 12–16 h at 30°C.\nNext morning, dilute the culture to OD660 0.1 in 250 mL of YEPD.\nWhen diluted yeast culture grow to OD660 = 0.7, harvest cells by centrifuging at 2000 × g for 8 min at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove supernatant and wash the cell pellet with 50 mL of ddH2O followed by 50 mL of 1× LiOAc/TE. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 1× LiOAc/TE, which results in ∼2 mL of cell suspension (cell pellet volume: 1× LiOAc/TE ∼ 1:1).\nDenature the carrier DNA (herring sperm DNA) by heating at 95°C for at least 5 min. Cool for ∼2 min on ice before use.\nMix the 2 mL of yeast suspension from step e with 600 μL carrier DNA and 20 mL of 1× LiOAc/TE + 40% PEG (either PEG3350 or PEG8000) in a 50 mL conical tube.",
    "Add 20 μg of linearized DNA to the mixture, and thoroughly vortex for 60 s.\nIncubate the mixture at 30°C for 30 min followed by heat shock at 42°C for 30 min.\nFill the 50 mL tube with ddH2O and gently invert 10 times, pellet the cells by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min and wash with 50 mL ddH2O to remove LiOAc and PEG.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of selection medium (SCD-Ura in our case).\nTake out 100 μL of the suspension, serial dilute (1:10 and 1:100), and plate on SCD-Ura plates to check the transformation efficiency.\nNote: Use the colony number growing on the plate to estimate the total number of yeast colonies. Normally we get 1–3 × 104 colonies from 250 mL of yeast culture and 20 μg DNA.\nTransfer the rest of the cell suspension to 1 L of SCD-Ura medium and culture for two days at 30°C.\nHarvest cells at 2000 × g for 8 min at 20°C–22°C. Mix the cell pellet with an equal volume of 30% glycerol, make 1 mL aliquots, and store at −80°C.\nNote: We normally keep 20 aliquots for each transformation. Each 1 mL aliquot should contain ∼109 cells. Therefore, one aliquot is sufficient to represent the sequence diversity of a library with 10–100 k complexity.\nHigh-throughput MNase-ISO assay\nTiming: 2 days (for step 22)\nTiming: 2 days (for step 23)\nTo measure nucleosome occupancy over the ISO sequences, treat the mixed yeast library with MNase, purify digested mono-nucleosomal DNA, amplify the target region using PCR, and perform amplicon sequencing.\nMNase assay on the yeast ISO library.\nThaw pooled yeast library and inoculate 1 mL of cells into 250 mL SCD-Ura medium. Grow cells for 12–16 h.",
    "Dilute the culture to OD660 0.02–0.05 in SCD-Met medium, then culture them until OD660 is 0.15–0.2.\nNote: The protocol below is for one reaction and one control, each starting with 10 mL of cells with OD660 0.15 (∼2 × 107 of yeast cells each). The MNase assay typically recovers 10%–20% of DNA, and thus from one reaction, we expect to get 2–4 × 106 copies of library DNA. For a library with 1 k complexity, this allows 2–4 k DNA molecules per type on average, which, in our experience, is the minimum amount required to get a reproducible measurement (5× more reaction is recommended for MNase-treated cells, 1× reaction is usually sufficient for control due to higher DNA recovery). For a larger yeast library, the volume needs to be scaled up accordingly.\nAdd 10 mL of cell culture into each 15 mL tube. Centrifuge at 1900 × g for 4 min. Discard supernatant.\nResuspend each 1.5 OD660 unit of cells in 1 mL cold water (OD660 unit = OD660 value ∗ volume). Transfer resuspended cells to a 1.5 mL tube.\nPellet cells in a microfuge at 800 × g at 4°C for 5 min and remove as much liquid as possible. Add 1 mL of 1 M ice-cold sorbitol to each tube.\nPellet the cells again and remove as much liquid as possible. Resuspend the cells in 500 μL of cold spheroplasting solution and add 30 μL of 0.5 mg/mL zymolyase.\nIncubate at 20°C–22°C for 6–7 min with gentle inversion.\nNote: The incubation time is influenced by the strain type and growth condition.\nNote: After zymolyase digestion, always keep cells cold until MNase digestion.\nPre-warm quench buffer by 37°C incubation.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 500 × g for 3 min at 4°C and carefully wash twice with 1 mL 1 M ice-cold sorbitol by gently dislodging and stirring the cell pellet with a 1000 μL pipette tip. Do not pipette up and down or vortex.\nGently resuspend cells in 200 μL of cold MNase digestion buffer with a pipette tip.\nCritical: Cells are fragile after zymolyase digestion, so resuspend cells very gently.\nAdd 0.5 μL of MNase to each reaction and then incubate for 8 min in a 37°C water bath.\nNote: In our experience, this MNase to DNA ratio will convert >50% of chromatin into mono-nucleosomes. Due to variations in MNase activity, we recommend doing a MNase titration to find a concentration that will generate a mono-, di-, and tri- nucleosome ladder, but with most mass in the mono-nucleosome band. A mock digest without MNase will generate a genomic DNA sample (control).\nAdd 20 μL quench buffer and vortex to terminate the reaction. Samples are incubated at 65°C for 5–10 min.\nNote: The solution should become clearer after this step.\nAdd 0.2 mL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and vortex for 1 min.\nCentrifuge at >14,000 × g for 7–10 min at 20°C–22°C and carefully transfer the top layers (∼150 μL) to new 1.5 mL tubes. Add 2.5 times the volume of the top layer of 100% ethanol. Vortex for a few seconds and invert to mix.\nCentrifuge at >14,000 × g at 20°C–22°C for 5 min, remove supernatant, carefully aspirate all liquid.\nNote: You should see a clear pellet at this point.\nRe-suspend the pellet in 0.4 mL TE buffer (pH8.0) and add 20 μL of 10 mg/mL RNase A. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min.",
    "Add 6 μL of 5 M ammonium acetate plus 1 mL of 100% ethanol. Mix by inversion. Centrifuge at >14,000 × g at 20°C–22°C for 5 min.\nNote: Pellet size is likely to decrease but should still be visible.\nAspirate the supernatant using vacuum. Air-dry the pellet and resuspend genomic / MNase samples in 25 μL of ddH2O, respectively.\nNote: For the mock digest genomic sample, directly proceed to the next amplicon sequencing step.\nAnalyze MNase samples on a 1.5% TAE agarose gel electrophoresis with orange G dye (one sample per lane). Gel purify the ∼150 bp size product.\nCritical: Use orange G instead of bromophenol blue / purple dye to avoid masking the ∼150 bp DNA band.\nCritical: Use long-wavelength ultraviolet light or blue light to visualize DNA in the gel and cut the gel as quickly as possible to avoid damage to DNA.\nAmplicon sequencing.\nPCR amplify the regions containing the integrated synthetic sequences in both the MNase and genomic DNA samples.\nNote: Indexes and adaptors are added during two rounds of PCR (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2736-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

Four random nucleotides (NNNN) and sequencing-primer binding sequences (yellow and orange) are added to the amplicon during the first round PCR. Sequencing flow cell binding sequences (red and green) and an index sequence (black) are added during the second round PCR.

    "Note: Minimize PCR cycles to reduce bias generated during PCR. At least ∼200ng of PCR product is needed for Illumina sequencing.\nClean the PCR product by SPRI beads.\nCheck the quality of the amplicon library by Tape Station or Bioanalyzer. Specific amplification is expected to yield only one DNA band (not including the loading controls).\nNote: If multiple DNA bands are present, optimize the PCR reaction or gel purify the target band.\nPhiX spike-in (10%–30%) is added into the sequencing library for each flow cell to increase the diversity of the sequencing library.\nPerform amplicon sequencing on NextSeq platform with 1 × 100 bp single-end sequencing.\nNote: MNase-ISO amplicon needs to be significantly shorter than a nucleosome length (147 bp) to measure nucleosome occupancy. We usually restrict the amplicon to 100–120 bp, and therefore 100 bp read length is enough to cover the entire variable region.\nNote: If you are doing MNase-ISO, proceed to step 1 of quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section for data analysis.\nHigh-throughput DNMT-based ISO assay\nTiming: 2 days (for step 24)\nTiming: 2 h (for step 25)\nTiming: 3 days (for step 26)\nHere we described a step-by-step method for mapping nucleosomes by expressing DNMT in yeast.

If the amplicon under test is shorter, you also can use bisulfite conversion kit from other vendors.\nAmplicon sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA.\nDesign primers for DNMT-ISO.\nNote: Special considerations need to be made to design primers to amplify the bisulfite-converted DNA. Primers should be selected in a region with no “GC” dinucleotide to avoid bias for certain methylation status. In addition, bisulfite-converted DNA tends to be C-depleted, and the regions on the template used for priming should contain high “G” content to enhance PCR efficiency.\nSplit the background sequences into two strands, forward and reverse complement.\nOn both sequences, replace all Cs in “GC” dinucleotide with “Y” (C or T) and replace the rest of the Cs with “T”. Note that the two strands are no longer complementary.\nDetermine the region to amplify. Given our purpose of mapping multiple nucleosomes near the engineered TF sites in nucleosome −4, we amplified a ∼1.3 kb region including nucleosome −6 to −1.\nNear each edge of the region to amplify, find one 25–30 bp fragment with >30% G content, but no “GC” dinucleotide.

At least 200 ng of PCR product is needed for Pacbio seq. 1000 ng is recommended.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2736_31.csv\nNote: Bias will be generated during bisulfite PCR, so try to minimize the PCR cycle number.\nCritical: If barcoded universal primers are used during PacBio sequencing preparation, they need to be added during PCR. Alternatively, if barcodes are added post-PCR followed by SMRTbell ligation, there is no need to add any additional sequence during PCR.

    "Note: We used a 608 bp region in the CLN2 promoter as control (with primers PF1-CLN2m and PR1-CLN2m). For efficient bisulfite conversion, >98% of “C”s in non-“GC” context need to be converted to T. GC/GT ratio in the sequencing file (.SCF) is used to determine the methylation level (more details in the quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section below).\nCritical: Since we are using conditionally inducible transcription of DNMT in cells, its expression may be variable in different strains. It is very important to make sure that all samples have comparable methylation level before doing high-throughput sequencing.\nSubmit sample from step c for PacBio sequencing.\nNote: For sequencing sample preparation, follow the PacBio sequencing manual (https://www.pacb.com/[href=https://www.pacb.com/]).\nNote: If the amplicon is shorter than 600 bp, you may also use Illumina MiSeq (2 × 300)."
