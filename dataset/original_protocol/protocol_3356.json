    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissection and harvesting of DRG\nTiming: 1–2 h (depending on number of animals)\nCultures from 4 – 8 week old animals provide the best recovery of viable neurons. It is expected that each animal will yield approximately 50,000 cells, assuming cervical, thoracic, and lumbar DRG are collected. However, cell counting methods do not effectively distinguish between neurons and non-neuronal cells and thus are poor measures of sensory neuron yield. Details for estimating number of animals needed can be found in the \"Before you begin” section. The yield of viable neurons is highly dependent on the accuracy and speed with which the experimenter can harvest DRG.\nNote: The isolation of DRG from mice is a very precise and delicate procedure. If you do not have experience with fine dissections or surgeries, it is recommended that you perform a trial culture at a small scale before culturing cells for critical experiments. A similar protocol from Sleigh et al. contains excellent high resolution images and videos that can be a useful resource for experimenters unfamiliar with fine dissections or the relevant anatomy.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]\nSacrifice the animal with CO2. Alternatively, the animal can be anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and, once under deep anesthesia, sacrificed via decapitation.\nDecapitate the animal with large surgical scissors, cutting as close to the base of the skull as possible to avoid damaging cervical vertebra.\nNote: Animals can alternatively be sacrificed via cervical dislocation. This method is functional, but not ideal as it will damage the vertebral column and can affect tissue recovery.\nNote: Most institutional animal care and use committees require details about the method used to euthanize animals for any procedure. It is critical to sacrifice animals using the method described in the experimenter’s approved protocol.\nRemove the dorsal skin.",
    "Spray the animal thoroughly with 70% ethanol.\nPinch the skin above the pelvis with forceps and lift (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3121-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Removal of dorsal skin\nVisual representation of step 3.\n(A) Dashed line represents approximate cutting site.\n(B) An image for placement of the dissection scissors.\nUsing fine dissecting scissors, cut the pinched skin (cutting plane of scissors aligned with the left/right nose/tail plane of the animal) beginning at the pelvis and continuing to cut in a cranial direction to remove the dorsal skin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nDissect the vertebral column.\nCut the tissue between the scapulae and upper ribs and pull the scapulae away from the vertebral column (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3121-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dissection of the vertebral column\nVisual representation of step 4. Dashed lines indicate Approximate cut sites.\n(A) Cut site to move scapula.\n(B) Cut site below lumbosacral joint.\n(C) Cut sites to remove vertebral column.\n(D) Fully dissected vertebral column.\nCut the vertebral column at or below the lumbosacral joint (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nUsing the thumb and index finger to locate the top of the pelvis.\nCut just below this point by inserting the blade of the fine scissors under the ventral side of the pelvis perpendicular to the vertebral column, with the other blade remaining exposed on the dorsal side.\nSqueeze firmly to cut through the upper region of the pelvis.\nFrom here, cut in a cranial direction through the ribs on the left and right side of the spine (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nLift the vertebral column and cut any tissue and organs attached to the ventral side\nHemi-sectioning the vertebral column.",
    "Using fine scissors, cut away any muscle and fatty tissue obscuring the dorsal and ventral side of the vertebral column. Remove enough tissue that the midline of the vertebrae can be seen along the entire length of the vertebral column on both the dorsal and ventral side. It is not necessary to fully expose the bone (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3121-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Hemi-sectioning of the vertebral column\nVisual representation of Step 5.\n(A) View of dorsal side.\n(B) View of ventral side.\n(C) Hemi-sectioned vertebral column.\nNote: Some protocols call for the completely removal of ribs and tissue from the sides of the vertebral column. This is not necessary, and excessive ‘cleaning’ of the vertebral column can make it more difficult to handle while hemi-sectioning and collecting DRG. Additionally, many experiments involve identifying the lumbar DRG associated with the sciatic nerve (lumbar 3–5). The most caudal rib is useful in identifying the final thoracic vertebra, with the next caudal vertebra being lumbar 1. Identification of these vertebrae is more difficult when the ribs are fully removed.\nTo hemi-section the spine, insert the bottom blade of a fine dissecting scissors into the opening on the cervical end of the spine and cut in a sacral direction along the dorsal midline down the length of the spine. Repeat this process for the ventral side (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3C).\nStore the hemi-sections in ice-cold HBSS.\nCritical: Do not use ethanol after cutting into the vertebrae, as this can result in loss of neurons.\nHarvest DRG.\nHarvest DRG from one hemi-section at a time, leaving the other submerged in ice-cold HBSS.\nRemove the spinal cord from the hemi-section with fine forceps.\nGently insert one prong of the forceps between the spinal cord and interior of the vertebrae.",
    "Lift or peel the spinal cord away from the bone (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4C). Do not pull with too much force, as you may remove DRGs with the spinal cord.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3121-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Removal of spinal cord and dura\nVisual representation of Step 6b, c.\n(A) Forceps placement to remove spinal cord.\n(B) Removal of cervical portion of spinal cord.\n(C) Fully removed spinal cord and partially removed dura.\nNote: Mice have 30–31 vertebrae, and therefore 30–31 pairs of DRG. The number of DRG recovered is dependent on where the vertebral column was severed. The anterior cervical vertebrae are often lost during decapitation, depending on scissor placement. Sacral vertebrae 2–4 are generally lost when separating the posterior end of the vertebral column, with sacral vertebra 1 DRG sometimes remaining accessible. 22–24 DRG should consistently be accessible from each hemi-section.\nNote: by orienting the hemi-section dorsal side up and removing the spinal cord with an out-and-down motion, many of the DRG fibers will be exposed and can serve as a guide to locate the DRG.\nThe dura forms a transparent layer between the spinal cord and the interior of the vertebrae. This can be removed in a manner similar to the spinal cord (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nThe DRG should now be exposed.\nTo remove DRG, locate the intervertebral foramen (the gap between the vertebrae) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3121-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Harvesting DRG\n(A–C) Schematic representation of DRG harvesting.\n(D) DRG harvesting.\n(E) Cut site for removal of fiber from DRG.\nInsert the tip of a fine forceps, slightly open, into this space (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nManeuver the tip of the forceps under the “head” of the DRG. Gently close the forceps and lift out (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nCritical: Do not grasp the “head” of the DRG with the forceps as this will damage neuronal soma.",
    "Note: the tips of the super fine forceps can be bent or blunted if pressed into bone. Always work delicately when removing the spinal cord, dura, and DRG to avoid damaging the forceps.\nPlace the DRG in a petri dish containing PBS or HBSS.\nUsing fine spring scissors, cut the fibers from the DRG “head” (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nPlace the DRG in the collection tube. Keep on ice for the duration of the dissection. Repeat this process until all the DRG have been collected.\nNote: The fibers often bunch or stick to the DRG when placed in liquid. Simply manipulate the tissue with forceps so that the fibers are stretched away from the DRG, then cut the fiber.\nNote: It can be helpful to perform these steps using a stereomicroscope or magnifying goggles. This is recommended for those who are new to DRG dissections.\nNote: There is a risk of DRG tissue drying out during the harvesting process. While an experienced experimenter can collect all DRG from a hemi-section before the tissues have dried, this may be challenging for those with less experience. To avoid this issue, it is advised that the experimenter submerge the hemi-section in ice-cold HBSS periodically while harvesting. Alternatively, cold HBSS can be applied with a dropper.\nCritical: It is crucial that fur is not retained from DRG tissues as this can easily lead to fungal contamination of the culture. This can be avoided by keeping the fur soaked in 70% ethanol and keeping a clean workspace. It is also strongly recommended that the experimenter change gloves and move to a new work area once the vertebral column has been isolated.",
    "Pause point: If necessary, the tissues can be temporarily stored in the collection tube on ice. However, it is not recommended to leave tissues on ice for longer than 1 h.\nNote: It is common in many facilities to perform surgeries and dissections in fume hoods. This may be recommended as a safety measure to prevent isoflurane inhalation. This is not a reliable method to eliminate contamination as the main source of fungal contamination is from the animal and fume hoods are not designed to reduce contamination from the environment. Using a BSC for steps 4b-6 may aid in eliminating contamination from the dissection environment. This may be helpful if one has access to a dedicated BSC for animal work. We would not recommend performing animal dissections in a BSC that is also used for mammalian cell culture due to the high risk of cross-contamination.\nTissue dissociation\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThe purpose of this step is to dissociate the tissues to generate a cell suspension that can be plated and cultured.\nPellet the DRG by centrifuging for 1–2 min at 400 × g.\nWhile centrifuging, thaw aliquots of Solutions A, D, and T, and begin warming media in a 37°C water bath.\nAspirate the HBSS, taking care to not disrupt the pellet.\nAdd 1 mL of Solution A, pipetting with modest force to break up the pellet. If needed, gently tap the vial to further disrupt the pellet. Avoid aggressive handling at this stage as tissues may stick to the sidewall of the vial.\nNote: Do not disrupt the pellet by trituration, as this usually results in tissue becoming trapped within the pipette tip.\nIncubate for 10–25 min at 37°C, tapping to disrupt the pellet halfway through the incubation time.\nCentrifuge for 1–2 min at 400 × g.",
    "Aspirate Solution A. Add 1 mL Solution D. Tap the tube to disrupt the pellet.\nIncubate for 20 min at 37°C, tapping to disrupt the pellet halfway through the incubation time.\nDuring this incubation, aspirate the PDL solution from the coated culture dish and wash once with sterile ddH2O. Aspirate and allow to dry in a BSC.\nCentrifuge for 1–2 min at 400 × g.\nAspirate Solution D. Add 1 mL of Solution T.\nTriturate using a P1000 until homogenous. The mixture should appear pink and cloudy, though some small pieces of tissue may be visible.\nPlace a 70 μm cell strainer in an open 50 mL conical vial such that the strainer basket sits inside the opening of the conical vial.\nPipet the mixture over the strainer. Wash the strainer with 10–20 mL of warmed DMEM/F12.\nCentrifuge 5 min at 400 x g.\nAspirate the media.\nResuspend in an appropriate volume of DRG culture media (see Plating).\nPlating and culture\nTiming: 45 min to 1 h\nThe plating method described here is optimized to concentrate DRG neurons in a localized area on the chosen culture dish, improving neuronal survival and efficiency of imaging.\nResuspend cells in enough media to plate as a single droplet per well. The volume will depend on the culture area and the number of cells plated. A ratio of 25–30 μL per ∼5,000 cells is sufficient for most applications. For example, we commonly resuspend total DRG cells from one animal in 240 μL media, and plate one 25 μL droplet per well of an 8-well chamber slide.\nPipette the desired volume of cell suspension onto the culture dish or cover slip, taking care to not allow the suspension to spread around the plate.",
    "Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30–45 min to allow the cells to adhere.\nGently add an appropriate volume of media. The volume required will be dependent on the vessel being used for culture.\nCompletely replace the media every other day, taking care to not wash the cells off the plate.\nNote: To ensure the recovery of viable neurons, monitor the morphology of the cultures over time. This is easiest with a phase contrast microscope. After the first media change, neurons should be clearly visible and can be identified by their large circular soma. Non-neuronal cells will appear smaller, flatter, and have an elongated or triangular morphology. Neurites begin growing within hours, and should be visible on all neurons within a day, though they can be difficult to see with low magnification.\nNote: A significant amount of debris will be present in the cell suspension upon plating. Much of this debris will initially be loosely attached to the plate, but should be almost entirely removed from the surface of the plate after the first media change. Some debris may be seen floating at the surface of the media. This will not affect the culture and will be removed with the next media change.\nNote: The duration of the culture will depend on the experiment being performed. For example, to examine growth cones or axon regeneration, neurons may be cultured for 1–3 days. To examine a more mature state, neurons may be cultured for 6–9 days.\nImmunocytochemistry\nTiming: 2 days",
    "The purpose of this step is to immunolabel desired targets in a primary DRG neuron culture. We have found the procedure below to be effective for numerous cytosolic targets. However, different epitopes may require optimization to effectively label. While we cannot include an exhaustive list of alternate steps, we include notes providing examples of where the protocol can be optimized. The steps below were performed using 8-well chamber slides with removable wells, but can be easily applied to other common methods of culturing cells for microscopy including cultures grown on coverslips and MatTek glass bottom dishes (e.g., MatTek P35G-1.5-14-C). For 8-well chamber slides, a volume of 150–200 μL per well is used for each reagent. Except where specifically indicated, all steps are performed at 20°C–23°C.\nAspirate the media from each well and wash with PBS warmed to 37°C.\nTo fix cells, aspirate each well and add 4% formaldehyde. Incubate for 15 min.\nNote: When aspirating wells, do not pipette or vacuum from the surface on which cells are attached, as this may result in loss of cells.\nNote: When pipetting into wells, dispense solutions down the side wall of the well rather than directly onto the bottom of the plate.\nAspirate and add PBS. Incubate 2–5 min. Repeat this for 3 total PBS washes.\nPause point: After the third wash, cells can be stored in PBS at 4°C for up to one week. It is advised to add extra PBS and leave the cap covering the wells to avoid drying.\nTo permeabilize, aspirate the PBS and add 0.5% Triton X-100. Incubate 10 min.",
    "Note: The permeabilization method can be altered as needed, depending on the targeted epitope. Less harsh permeabilization can be achieved by lowering the Triton X-100 concentration or replacement with detergents such as Tween 20 or saponin. Labeling extracellular epitopes may negate the need for permeabilization.\nPerform 3 PBS washes as in step 21.\nAspirate the PBS and add blocking solution (10% goat serum in PBS) and incubate for 1 h.\nNote: The incubation time for blocking can be extended by up to 2 h with no impact on labeling. The blocking solution can be optimized for different epitopes. Lowering the goat serum concentration and/or inclusion of low concentration detergent can aid labeling some targets.\nAspirate and add primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution.\nNote: Lower serum concentration is often used for antibody incubations and can aid in labeling some targets.\nNote: The optimal concentration of each primary antibody is highly variable and should be determined empirically, beginning with the manufacturer’s recommended dilutions.\nNote: It is crucial to always include a cell type marker when immunolabeling primary DRG cultures. Common pan-neuronal markers for these cultures include beta-III tubulin, and NeuN. Peripherin is predominantly expressed by sensory neurons associated with Aδ- and C-fibers. NF200 is a common marker for large diameter neurons associated with myelinated A fibers. Markers for more specific subpopulations of nociceptors include TRPV1, CGRP, and IB4, among others .\nIncubate 14–18 h at 4°C.\nPerform 3 PBS washes as in step 21.\nAspirate and add secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Incubate for 1 h away from light.\nNote: Secondary antibody concentration should be based on the manufacturer’s recommendation and empirically validated.\nNote: To preserve fluorophores, all subsequent incubations should be performed in the dark by keeping the slide in an opaque container.\nPerform 3 PBS washes as before.",
    "Optional: Nuclear staining with DAPI may be performed at this point. Add DAPI (100 ng/mL in PBS) and incubate for 10 min. Wash 3 times with PBS before proceeding to the next step\nAspirate the PBS.\nSeparate the wells from the slide. This step is only necessary if using chamber slides.\nPlace the slide in the plastic frame with the tab at the open end.\nPosition the splitter in the channels of the frame.\nTo remove the wells, press the splitter forward, lifting slightly at the back to prevent it catching on the slide.\nRemove the slide and splitter from the frame, then lift the wells off of the slide.\nTo mount, add 80–90 μL mounting media to the slide in evenly dispersed drops.\nPlace a coverslip on the slide.\nPress down gently with the back of a P200 pipette tip or capped pen to force any air bubbles out from under the cover slip.\nUse a paper towel to wick away excess mounting media from the edges of the coverslip. Do this frequently enough to prevent beads of mounting media from breaking on the surface of the cover slip.\nIf using hard mount media such as ProLong, allow the mounting media to set for roughly 2 h at 20°C–23°C .\nSeal the edges of the slide with quick drying nail polish, taking care to not obscure any part of the viewable area. Ensure that nail polish has completely dried before imaging.\nThe slide is now ready to be imaged.",
    "Note: If not imaging the same day, the slide will need to be stored. It is important to be aware that different fluorophores have highly variable lifespans. Fluorophore stability is also affected by the mounting media, light exposure and storage conditions. If storing longer than 48 h we recommend doing so at −20°C to preserve fluorophores. If stored at −20°C, slides can be imaged > 1 week after mounting. Many fluorophores are also stable for long periods (> 1 week) at 4°C. However, these recommendations should not supersede manufacturer’s recommended storage conditions for your reagents.\nCritical: Always perform all experimental conditions and controls for a replicate in parallel and always image them on the same day. Though fluorophores will be visible for > 1 week if properly stored, they will always exhibit some loss of fluorescence over time. If images from one experiment are acquired on different days, quantifications cannot be considered to be properly normalized.\nCritical: When collecting immunofluorescence data, it is necessary to use the chosen cell-type marker to set a region of interest (ROI) to define the area to be measured."
