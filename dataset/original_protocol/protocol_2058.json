    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\n      This protocol is aimed at isolating hepatocytes from mouse liver.\n      Following anesthesia, the vena cava is cannulated and the liver is\n      perfused to chelate calcium and wash out blood. Then, collagenase is\n      perfused to the liver in order to dissociate extracellular matrix.\n      Finally, the liver is dissected and hepatocytes are purified by\n      density-based separation. This protocol presents several advances over\n      similar protocols (Berry and Friend, 1969[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3];\n      Casciano, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4];\n      Klaunig et al., 1981[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8];\n      Li et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9];\n      Renton et al., 1978[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11];\n      Seglen, 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12];\n      Severgnini et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). The main improvements of\n      this protocol are better reproducibility, shortened duration, reduced\n      technical challenge, increased yield and higher viability. These are\n      achieved by several steps we altered or optimized. For example: (a) We\n      found that retrograde perfusion through the vena cava permits easier\n      cannulation as opposed to portal vein cannulation. (b) Periodical clamping\n      of the portal vein provides a visible checkpoint for proper perfusion and\n      greatly facilitates efficient washing and digestion. (c) The type of\n      collagenase used (Liberase) shows quicker digestion and better\n      reproducibility compared to other collagenases. (d) Percoll-based density\n      separation results in a population of purified hepatocytes of high\n      viability. Some of these protocol improvements were already implemented in\n      our previous publications (Goldstein et al., 2017a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5];\n      Goldstein et al., 2017b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) where we isolated hepatocytes\n      for experiments demanding a high yield of cells (such as chromatin\n      immunoprecipitation sequencing – ChIP-seq).\n    \nPump Preparation and Mouse Anesthesia\nTiming: 15–20 min\n    \n      Here, the pump is washed and primed with perfusion buffer. The mouse is\n      anesthetized and positioned on the dissection tray.\n    \nThis section is shown in Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nWarm water bath to 42°C.\nPlace perfusion buffer in the water bath.\n        Prepare the peristaltic pump:\n        \nRun 70% ethanol through the tubing.\nRun air through the tubing for 30–60 s.",
    "Wipe the end of the tubing with a paper towel.\n            Connect 27-gauge needle to the outlet end of the tubing using a luer\n            lock (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n          \n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \n          Methods Video S1. Mouse Positioning and Preparations for Cannulation\n        \n          The anesthetized mouse is positioned on the dissection tray. The mouse\n          fur and skin are cut in a “U” shape. Mouse intestine and the rest of\n          viscera are moved to the right and both the portal vein and vena cava\n          are revealed. Steps: 7–10.\n        \nimgsrc:https://hivebench-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/165-Fig1.jpg\n          Figure 1. Needle and Tubing Preparation\n        \n          The needle is connected to the outlet end of the tubing by using a\n          luer lock. The tubing and needle fixture is supported by a heavy\n          object (here a media bottle ring weight) to elevate it from the\n          dissection tray. This elevation facilitates proper cannulation.\n        \n        Prime the tubing with warm perfusion buffer (pump speed 3 mL/min).\n      \nNote: Purge some perfusion buffer to wash\n      residual ethanol.\n    \nNote: Avoid bubbles in the tubing.\n    \nNote: The optimal pump speed varies\n      greatly depending on the tubing diameter, needle gauge and other\n      specifications. In this protocol, pump speed was optimized to the detailed\n      tubing specifications and needle gauge (see\n      Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\n    \n        Prepare two 50 mL tubes (labeled “DB-chilled” and “DB-Liberase”), each\n        with 10 mL digestion buffer. Keep the tube labeled “DB-chilled” on ice.\n        Add 250 μL Liberase solution to the tube labeled “DB-Liberase” and warm\n        it in the water bath.\n      \n        Anesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection of anesthesia mix\n        (3.75 μL/g body weight. Final concentration for ketamine = 112.5 mg/kg;\n        for xylazine =22.5 mg/kg).\n      \nNote: Make sure the mouse is completely\n      anesthetized by the pedal reflex.\n    \nNote: Mice should be 8–10 weeks old,\n      younger mice have smaller veins, older mice have more fat lining the vena",
    "cava. Both these attributes make cannulation more challenging.\n    \n        Place mouse on the edge of the dissection tray and secure limbs using\n        needles (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\n      \nimgsrc:https://hivebench-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/165-Fig2.jpg\n          Figure 2. Mouse Positioning on the Dissection Tray\n        \n          The anaesthetized mouse is placed on the edge of the dissection tray\n          with its head protruding outside and its limbs secured with needles.\n          Securing limbs with tape is not recommended because the area will be\n          soaked with liquid during procedure, potentially loosening adhesion.\n        \nNote: The head should be protruding\n      outside the tray. This facilitates easier cannulation in later steps.\n    \nWet the fur thoroughly with 70% ethanol.\n        Make a “U”-shaped incision through the skin, secure the skin near the\n        head using a needle (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n      \nimgsrc:https://hivebench-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/165-Fig3.jpg\n          Figure 3. Incision and Preparing for Cannulation\n        \n          The mouse fur and skin are cut in a “U” shape, the mouse skin is\n          placed and secured near the head with a needle.\n        \n        Move the intestine to the right to reveal the portal vein and vena cava\n        (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Place a stable and heavy object adjacent\n        to the mouse hind legs to support the tubing such that it is slightly\n        higher than the mouse, lay the tubing and the needle on the object (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The edge of the needle should rest on the vena cava in a flat angle\n        (i.e., parallel to the vein, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n      \nimgsrc:https://hivebench-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/165-Fig4.jpg\n          Figure 4. Portal Vein and Vena Cava exposure\n        \n          Mouse intestine and the rest of the viscera are moved to the right.\n          Both the portal vein and vena cava are revealed.\n        \nimgsrc:https://hivebench-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/165-Fig5.jpg\n          Figure 5. Cannulation of the Vena Cava\n        \n          The tip of the needle is inserted (bevel side up, in an almost flat\n          angle) into the vena cava above the kidney. The tubing rests on the\n          elevating object without manual support.",
    "Note: Make sure that the tubing and needle\n      do not move or change angle when you let go.\n    \nCannulation and Perfusion\nTiming: 10–15 min\n    \n      Here, the inferior vena cava is cannulated and the liver is perfused to\n      wash out blood and circulating cells from the liver as well as to\n      eliminate calcium via EDTA. Chelating calcium with EDTA facilitates\n      loosening of cell-cell connections by perturbing calcium-dependent\n      adhesion factors. This step, initially suggested by (Seglen, 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) serves as a preparative step for liver digestion in the next section.\n      The original protocol was developed for rat and therefore, perfusing the\n      liver through the portal vein was amenable. We found that in mice,\n      retrograde perfusion via the inferior vena cava is significantly less\n      challenging and therefore more reproducible.\n    \nThis section is shown in Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\n        Turn on the pump and let the warm perfusion buffer reach the needle (the\n        buffer within the tubing has already cooled down to 20°C–25°C).\n      \nNote: Before proceeding, make sure you\n      clearly see the portal vein and vena cava.\n    \n        While buffer is running through the needle, insert the needle into the\n        vena cava above the kidney (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n      \nCritical: After 1–2 s, you should see\n      white spots forming in the liver and/or expansion/swelling of the portal\n      vein , this means perfusion buffer is indeed flowing through the liver (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\n    \nNote: Insert the needle in a flat angle\n      relative to the vein.\n    \nNote: The needle bevel should be facing\n      upwards.\n    \n        Immediately upon appearance of white spots and/or portal vein swelling\n        (occurs 2–3 s after cannulation), cut the portal vein with scissors. The\n        liver should clear of blood instantly; you’ll observe plenty of blood\n        rushing out of the portal vein and the liver will turn yellow-white\n        within a few seconds.",
    "Clamp the portal vein with forceps for 7–10 s (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B). Make sure no fluid is passing through.\n      \n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \n          Methods Video S2. Liver Cannulation and Perfusion\n        \n          The inferior vena cava is cannulated and the liver is perfused to wash\n          out blood and circulating cells as well as to eliminate calcium via\n          EDTA. Steps: 11–15.\n        \nimgsrc:https://hivebench-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/165-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Clamping the Portal Vein\n          (A and B) The portal vein is clamped with forceps for 7–10 s to stop\n          fluid exiting the liver. Liver swells upon clamping (compare A to B).\n        \nCritical: Make sure the liver swells\n      during clamp and then relaxes upon release of clamp (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\n    \nNote: Clamping serves two purposes: (a)\n      allowing perfusion buffer to reach all liver vasculature. (b) a visible\n      checkpoint (liver swelling and relaxation) validating liver is indeed\n      perfused. This is important because in some cases the liver seems white\n      only due to passive clearing of blood from the severed portal vein and not\n      from active perfusion.\n    \n        After 30 s perform a second clamp, make sure you observe liver swelling\n        and relaxation. If the liver is completely washed of blood, move to the\n        next section.\n      \nDigestion\nTiming: 10–15 min\n    \n      Here, Collagenase (Liberase) is perfused to the liver in order to digest\n      collagen in the extracellular matrix, thereby facilitating cell dispersion\n      (originally proposed by Berry and Friend, (1969)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\n      Collagenase is a calcium-dependent enzyme and therefore calcium is\n      included in the digestion buffer.\n    \n      This section is shown in Methods Videos S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] and\n      S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]\n        Stop the pump and quickly transfer the inlet tubing from perfusion\n        buffer to the pre-warmed “DB-Liberase” tube. Quickly turn the pump back\n        on.\n      \nNote: Make sure the tubing reaches the\n      bottom of the 50 mL tube and make sure no bubbles got in the tubing (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).",
    "Clamp the liver one more time, prior to digestion buffer arriving to the\n        liver. Make sure the liver swells and relaxes.\n      \n        While digestion buffer is perfused into the liver, clamp the portal vein\n        every minute but no more than 3–4 times.\n      \nNote: When clamping while digestion buffer\n      is perfused, the liver swells to maximal volume in the first clamp and\n      does not relax. This is normal.\n    \nNote: Digestion buffer contains phenol\n      red. This facilitates visualization of when the liver is perfused with\n      digestion buffer rather than perfusion buffer (which does not contain\n      phenol red).\n    \nRemove the needle before air gets into the liver.\n        Dissect out the liver gently (it is now very flimsy and frail): using\n        forceps, grab the central connective tissue between the lobes and\n        slightly lift upwards, using it as an anchor point. Cut all the\n        connections of the liver to other organs, remove the gall bladder, place\n        the liver in the tube labeled “DB-chilled” and put it back on ice.\n      \nNote: If needed, the liver can stay on ice\n      for 30–40 min.\n    \nClean the pump with ethanol (see step 3).\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S3.

    "Transfer liver and media to a 10 cm plate (not pre-coated with\n        collagen).\n      \n        Rupture liver sack with fine tip forceps in a few locations along the\n        liver surface and gently release cells using a cell lifter.\n      \nNote: Tilt the plate to have the liver\n      submerged in the media to improve releasing of cells.\n    \nNote: The liver should tear apart easily.\n      Do not cut the liver to pieces, leave it whole.\n    \n        Filter 5 mL of suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL\n        tube.
