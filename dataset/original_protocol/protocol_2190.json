    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\niPSC Preparation\nTiming: ∼2 weeks\nThere are two goals for this step:\nTo select iPSC lines with potential to differentiate into melanocytes,\nTo guarantee that these iPSCs are in good state before induction.\nCritical: Different iPSC lines show different potentials towards melanocyte differentiation. Therefore, it is critical to select or screen proper cell lines for this purpose (see Before you Begin, Selection of iPSC Lines above).\nCritical: iPSCs that are not properly adjusted to a normal state usually fail to differentiate into melanocytes.\nThaw Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)\nTiming: ∼50 min\nAdd 2 mL 0.1% gelatin to each 60 mm dish and ensure that the solution coats the entire bottom of the well.\nIncubate at 37°C for at least 30 min.\nAspirate the gelatin and discard.\nPlate mitomycin C-inactivated MEFs (at a density of 6x105 viable cells/60 mm dish) and culture them in 5 mL DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS. Incubate MEFs at 37°C for 12–24 h.\nCheck whether the cell density reach at least 70%–80% confluence.\nCritical: Both the quality and density of MEFs are critical for iPSC cultures; poor quality or low density can lead to spontaneous iPSC differentiation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/18-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The Quality and Density of MEFs Are Closely Related to the Quality of the iPSCs\nProper density of MEFs with good quality (a) and too low density with bad quality (b, large and flat morphology). Undifferentiated iPSCs typically show a colony with a sharp edge, compact cell junction, and high cell density in the center (c). Colonies with enlarged cells and significant fissures between cells usually indicate spontaneous differentiation (d). Scale bar: 200 μm.",
    "Critical: Check the quality (as judged by morphology) and determine the percent viability for each batch of mitomycin C-inactivated MEFs before use. If cells are found at a low confluence the day after plating, it is necessary to seed more cells into the original MEF cultures to reach the required 70-80% confluence and use them for iPSC cultures the next day.\nThaw the Frozen iPSCs\nTiming: ∼30 min\nPrepare mitomycin C–treated MEFs the day before thawing the iPSCs (refer to Thaw Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts).\nAspirate the medium and thoroughly wash the MEFs with 5 mL pre-warmed DMEM to remove FBS. Discard DMEM.\nAdd 4 mL hES medium to each 60 mm dish and return to the incubator.\nPrepare 5 mL DMEM/F12 medium in a 15 mL conical tube.\nTransfer the cryovial of iPSCs from liquid nitrogen to the 37°C water bath to thaw the cells quickly.\nGently pipette (2–3 times) and transfer the cell suspension to the tube prepared in step 4.\nAdd 1 mL DMEM/F12 medium into the frozen tube to collect the residual cells and transfer the suspension into the same conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 1 mL hES medium and resuspend the cells pipetting 2–3 times gently.\nTransfer the cell suspension to the dish prepared in step 3 and add Y-27632 to a final concentration of 10 μM.\nGently rock the plate side to side, and back and forth, to achieve an even dispersion of cells across the well and incubate in a 37°C incubator (Methods Video 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPause Point: Do not disturb the dish for at least 12 h.\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n            \nMethods Video 1\nCross Shake of the Culture Plate in Cell Thawing",
    "Refer to step 11 in Thaw the frozen iPSCs.\nChange the medium every day thereafter using MEF-based media (hES medium).\nPassage of iPSCs (MEF-Based Conditions)\nTiming: ∼40 min\nPrepare mitomycin C–treated MEFs the day before passage (refer to steps 1–3 in Thaw the Frozen iPSCs).\nWhen the iPSCs are of adequate size (usually 0.8–1 mm in diameter), discard the culture medium.\nWash the cells once with 4 mL DMEM/F12 medium and discard the wash medium.\nAdd 700 μL dissociation solution (prepared in Before you Begin, Dissociation Solution for Human iPSC Passage on MEF) and ensure that the solution covers the entire bottom of the well.\nIncubate at 15–25°C and observe cells under an inverted microscope.\nWhen the edges of the iPSC colonies become curled and unclear, remove the dissociation solution completely.\nWash cells twice with 4 mL pre-cooled DMEM/F12 medium. Aspirate and discard the wash medium.\nAdd 4 mL DMEM/F12 medium to the dish and gently pipette to break the colonies into small clumps.\nCritical: Do not pipette too vigorously; avoid breaking the iPSCs into single cells.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and wash the dish with 4 mL DMEM/F12 medium to collect the residual clumps.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, add hES medium, and gently resuspend the cells.\nAliquot the cell suspension (the ratio depends on cell lines) into the dishes prepared in step 1.\nCross-shake and culture in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nNote: Using pre-cooled media while passaging maintains low cellular metabolic activity thereby reducing cellular damage after detachment.\nPassage of iPSCs (Feeder-Free Condition)\nTiming: ∼60 min\nPrepare Matrigel-coated plates (refer to Before you Begin, Matrigel-Coated Plate).\nDiscard the culture medium. Wash the cells once with 2 mL pre-cooled DMEM/F12 medium.",
    "Add 600 μL of ReLeSR, ensuring the solution covers the entire bottom of the well. Aspirate ReLeSR within 1 min.\nIncubate at 15–25°C and observe cells under an inverted microscope.\nWhen there are obvious fissures between cells (about 5–8 min), tap the side of the plate firmly.\nAdd 2 mL mTeSR1 medium to the well and gently pipette to break large aggregates into small clumps.\nCritical: Do not pipette too vigorously; avoid forming clumps that are too small, or single cells.\nAliquot the cell suspension into the Matrigel-coated plates with adequate splits (the ratio depends on cell lines) and add additional medium to make the final volume 2 mL in each well.\nCross-shake and culture in a 37°C incubator.\nChange the medium every day.\nAlternatives: Depending on lab preference, the two-abovementioned dissociation solutions (dissociation solution for human iPSCs passage on MEF, and ReLeSR™) can be replaced with other commercial reagents, such as TrypLE™ Express, that perform a similar function.\nGeneration of Embryoid Bodies (EBs)\nTiming: ∼1 week\nThis step generates optimal EBs for melanocyte differentiation. Embryoid bodies can be formed either using aggregates with ultra-low attachment plates or using single cells with micro-space plates.\nThe aggregate method follows a simpler protocol and is recommended for inexperienced researchers.\nThe single cell method can generate EBs with uniform size and morphology.\nEB Formation using Aggregates\nTiming: ∼30 min\nDissociate iPSCs cultured under MEF-based conditions to generate small aggregates (refer to steps 1–10 of Passage of iPSCs, MEF-based conditions). Do not pipette vigorously; avoid breaking iPSCs into too small aggregates or single cells.\nDiscard the supernatant, add 2 mL hES medium (without bFGF), and gently resuspend the cells.\nTransfer these aggregates to ultra-low attachment plates and add Y-27632 to a final concentration of 10 μM.",
    "After 24 h, collect the aggregates and transfer them into 15 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 30 s at 15–25°C, to deposit the aggregates.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant to remove Y-27632.\nGently resuspend the aggregates in fresh hES medium (without bFGF) and transfer into the ultra-low attachment plates with 2 mL medium in each well.\nChange the medium when necessary (usually every day).\nOptional: The dissociation solution for EB formation, using aggregates, can be replaced by other commercial reagents such as TrypLE™ Express.\nOptional: hES medium (without bFGF) for EB cultures can be replaced by AggreWell™ EB formation medium.\nOptional: iPSCs cultured in feeder-free conditions can also be used to generate EB with the above protocol.\nEB Formation using Single Cells\nTiming: ∼60 min\nAspirate the culture medium of iPSCs cultured in feeder-free condition, wash the cells with DMEM/F12 medium and discard.\nFor each well of a 6-well plate, add 600 μL ACCUTASETM.\nIncubate for 4–6 min at 15–25°C. Check the cell morphology frequently using an inverted microscope.\nWhen the cells have become round, remove ACCUTASE TM.\nAdd 2 mL of DMEM/F12 and gently pipette the cells to dissociate them into single cells.\nTransfer the entire suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.\nWash the plate with another 2 mL of DMEM/F12 to collect the residual cells and transfer the suspension to the same tube.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 × g  at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL AggreWell EB formation medium.\nDetermine the viable cell density.\nSeed 2.5–5 × 10 5 cells into each well of an ElplasiaTM  plate (24-well), add additional medium until there is a final volume of 2 ml.\nAdd Y-27632 to a final concentration of 10 μM.",
    "Cross-shake the plate repeatedly to ensure the cells distribute uniformly across the micro-spaces.\nCulture in a 37°C incubator.\nAfter 24 h, gently pipette the bottom of the Elplasia TM plate and float the aggregates.\nCollect the aggregates and transfer them into a 15 mL conical tube.\nAllow the tube to stand for 2–3 min to allow the aggregates to settle.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully to remove Y-27632.\nGently resuspend the aggregates in fresh AggreWell EB formation medium and transfer into the ultra-low attachment plates, with 2 mL medium in each well.\nChange the medium when necessary (usually every day).\nNote: The frequency of media change depends on the number of EBs in each well and their growth capability.\nCritical: Medium change for EB formation must be timely and adequate to ensure that there are enough nutrients. Infrequent medium changes will lead to poor status.\nCritical: EBs in a good state have smooth borders and dark centers without cavities (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D), while EBs in a poor state have blurry boundaries and/or break easily and cannot be used for melanocytes differentiation (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nNote: To ensure a sufficient supply of fresh nutrients, split EBs into multiple wells when necessary.\nNote: When EBs reach about 300–500 μm in diameter and have compact centers (usually between 5 and 10 days, depending on the cell line), they are ready for differentiation (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nMelanocyte Differentiation\nTiming: ∼5–6 weeks\nThis step generates iMelanocytes from EBs; it takes about 5–6 weeks to generate fully differentiated iMelanocytes.\nNote: We divide the differentiation procedure into early and late stages, according to the time point, cell growth environment, and medium components.\nEarly Stage of Differentiation\nTiming: ∼3 weeks",
    "Early stage refers to the differentiation in the first 3 weeks and cells grow in colonies (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/18-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Early Stage of iPSC-Derived Melanocyte Differentiation\nDuring the first two weeks of suspension culture differentiation, EBs enlarge continuously. Although they show various morphologies, smooth and bright boundaries are typically found (week 2, a–c). Large quantities of melanocyte-like cells show a vigorous proliferative ability after they attach to the fibronectin-coated dishes (week 3, d–f). Scale bar: a–c, e, and f, 200 μm; d, 50 μm.\nCollect EBs that are ready for differentiation and transfer them into a 15 mL conical tube.\nAllow the tube to rest for 2–3 min and allow the aggregates to settle.\nCarefully remove the supernatant.\nResuspend EBs in melanocyte differentiation medium and transfer them into ultra-low attachment plates; for each well of a 6-well plate, 20 EBs are acceptable.\nReplace half of the medium every 2–3 days.\nTwo weeks later, collect the differentiated EBs and transfer them to fibronectin-coated plates; for each well of a 6-well plate, 10 EBs are acceptable).\nContinue the differentiation using melanocyte differentiation medium for another 7 days.\nReplace half of the medium every 2–3 days.\nSingle Cell Dissociation\nTiming: ∼30 min\nAt week 3 of differentiation, the density of iMelanocytes is very high (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D–4F), and they need to be dissociated into single cells and passaged (late stage).\nPrepare fibronectin-coated plate (refer to Before you Begin, Fibronectin-coated plate) at least 1 h ahead of single cell dissociation.\nAspirate and discard the culture medium. Gently wash the cells with DPBS.\nFor each well of a 6-well plate, add 600 μL TrypLE Express Enzyme and ensure complete coverage of cells.\nIncubate for 2–3 min at 15–25°C. Frequently observe the cell morphology using an inverted microscope.",
    "When the differentiated cells become round, add 2 mL of DMEM (low glucose) to dilute the enzyme.\nGently pipette the cells and transfer the entire suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.\nNote: Undifferentiated cells usually form aggregates after dissociation.\nCritical: do not pipette too vigorously to avoid dissociating them into single cells.\nWash the plate with another 2 mL of DMEM to collect the residual cells and add to the initial suspension.\nAllow the tube to stand for 2–3 min and allow the aggregates to settle.\nCarefully collect the suspension from the top of the tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with melanocyte differentiation medium (supplemented with 0.5% FBS and without TPA).\nDetermine the viable cell density.\nSeed iMelanocytes onto fibronectin-coated plates at a density of 2 × 104/cm2.\nChange the medium every 2–3 days and passage when the cells reach 90% confluence.\nNote: Commercial melanocyte medium, such as HEM 2201, is not suggested for the late stage culture as it cannot maintain iMelanocytes as long as the differentiation medium and usually leads to senescence.\nNote: iMelanocytes need to be plated at a relatively higher density (1.5–2 ×104/cm2 is recommended) than normal human epidermal melanocytes (usually 1×104/cm2), otherwise the proliferative ability decreases.\nPassage of iMelanocytes\nTiming: ∼30 min\nAfter single cell dissociation, epithelium-like cells and/or undifferentiated cells can initially be observed. Compared to iMelanocytes, it usually takes longer for these cells to become detached. As a result, differential dissociation can be used to purify iMelanocytes.\nPrepare fibronectin-coated plates (refer to Before you Begin, Fibronectin-Coated Plate) at least 1 h ahead of single cell dissociation.\nWhen the cells reach 90% confluence, aspirate and discard the culture medium.\nGently wash the cells with DPBS.",
    "For 60 mm dishes, add 600 μL TrypLE Express Enzyme and ensure complete coverage of cells.\nIncubate for 1–2 min at 15–25°C. Keep observing the cell morphology using an inverted microscope.\nWhen iMelanocytes form a round shape, gently tap the flask to detach the cells. (The epithelium-like cells and undifferentiated cells usually have not become round at this stage.)\nAdd 2 mL DMEM (low glucose) to dilute the enzyme and avoid pipetting the bottom of the well.\nTransfer the entire suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.\nWash the plate with fresh 2 mL DMEM to collect the residual cells, avoid pipetting the bottom of the well, and combine with the previous suspension.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with melanocyte differentiation medium (supplemented with 0.5% FBS and without TPA).\nDetermine the viable cell density (ideally > 90%).\nTransfer the iMelanocytes into newly prepared fibronectin-coated plates at a density of 2 × 104 /cm2.\nStorage of iMelanocytes\nTiming: ∼30 MIN\nThis step describes storage of iMelanocytes for transplantation or other applications.\nCritical: The quality of iMelanocytes must be confirmed before storage.\nCritical: Freezing steps must be followed strictly to ensure success.\nDissociate the iMelanocytes (Refer to step 1–9 of Passage of iMelanocytes).\nDetermine the viable cell density.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 × g at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with the appropriate volume of freezing medium (90% FBS supplemented with 10% DMSO).\nDispense aliquots of cell suspensions into cryovials.\nPut the vials in a gradient cooling box and store at −80°C.\nAfter 24 h, transfer the frozen cells to liquid nitrogen.\nPause Point: iMelanocytes can be stored in liquid nitrogen for at least one year, maintaining a good proliferative capacity after thawing.",
    "Note: Due to the damage caused by freezing, the cell density needs to be a little higher when thawing than when passaging (see also Single Cell Dissociation)."
