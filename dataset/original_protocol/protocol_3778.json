    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nPreparation of Cas9 RNPs\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes the procedure to prepare Cas9 RNP complexes for electroporation.\nEqual amounts of crRNA and tracrRNA solution (100 μM stock) were mixed in a 0.2-mL PCR tube. An example of the reagent amounts used for one electroporation reaction is shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_70_2.csv\nThe mixture was heated at 95°C for 5 min and then cooled to 20°C using a thermal cycler with a ramp rate setting of −0.1°C/s.\nAlternatives: Heated crRNA-tracrRNA complex can be cooled on the bench at 20°C–25°C.\nAlt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3 (IDT, 62 μM solution) was added to the cooled gRNA complex. Examples of the amount of reagent used for one electroporation reaction are shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_70_3.csv\nTo form the Cas9 RNP complexes, the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nPause Point: The Cas9 RNP complex can be stored at −80°C for 6 months.\nDirect Delivery of Cas9 RNPs by Electroporation\nTiming: 10–20 min\nThis step describes the procedure to deliver Cas9 RNPs to E. gracilis cells by electroporation.\nE. gracilis was cultured in KH medium (pH 5.5) for 3 days (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B), and 1 mL of the cell culture was transferred to a 1.5 mL tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/70-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of the Suspension of E. gracilis Cells for Electroporation\nTransfer of cultured E. gracilis cells (A), E. gracilis cells pellet after centrifugation (B), Resuspended E. gracilis cells (C).\nNote: The optical density at 600 nm of 10-fold dilution of E. gracilis after 3 days of culture is approximately 0.5–0.7.\nThe cell culture sample was centrifuged at 400 × g for 30 s (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), and the supernatant was removed.\nThe cells were then resuspended with the addition of 1 mL of electroporation solution.",
    "The cell suspension was centrifuged at 400 × g for 30 s, and the supernatant was removed.\nThe cells were resuspended in electroporation solution at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nThen, 48 μL of the E. gracilis suspension was transferred to 0.2 mL new tube (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/70-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation Procedure for Cas9 RNPs Introduction by Electroporation\nTransfer of resuspended E. gracilis cells (A), Addition of Cas9 RNPs (B), Transfer of Cas9 RNPs and cell suspension mixture to cuvette (C), Tapping of the cuvette (D).\nFinally, 2 μL of Cas9 RNP complex solution was added and the solution was mixed several times by pipetting (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Alternatively, to prevent the loss of Cas9 RNPs solution, the E. gracilis suspension can be directly transferred to a tube containing 2 μL of the RNP complex solution.\nCritical: The amount of Cas9 RNPs is important. If the RNP amount is reduced, the genome editing efficiency will decrease.\nThe Cas9 RNPs and E. gracilis suspension mixture was transferred to a 2-mm gap cuvette (EC-002; Nepa Gene) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nThe cuvette was tapped to drop the Cas9 RNP and cell suspension mixture to the bottom of the cuvette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nA NEPA21 Super Electroporator (Nepa Gene) was used for the introduction of the RNP complexes. The electroporation conditions are shown in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_70_4.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/70-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Operation Procedure for the Electroporator\nSettings of the electroporator (A), Insertion of the cuvette into the electrode chamber (B), Measurement of the impedance value (C), Initiation of electroporation (D).\nThe cuvette was inserted into the electrode chamber (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), and the “Ω” switch was pressed. The impedance value was usually approximately 0.4–0.5 kΩ (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nThe “Start” switch was pressed to initiate electroporation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).",
    "After electroporation, 1 mL of KH medium (pH 5.5) was added to the cuvette (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/70-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Procedure of Recovery Culture after Electroporation\nEjection of the cuvette from the electrode chamber (A), Addition of KH medium (B), Transfer of cell suspension to well plate (C), Covering of culture plate with aluminum foil (D) and recovery culture on a rotary shaker (E).\nThe cell suspension was transferred to a 12-well plate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C) and cultured on a rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 28°C under dark conditions (by covering with aluminum foil) for 24–72 h (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D and 5E).\nNote: Seal the plate with parafilm and surgical tape to prevent evaporation of the culture medium.\nSingle-Stranded Oligodeoxynucleotide-Mediated Knockin (Optional)\nTiming: 5 min\nThe high-efficiency knockin of short sequences (∼50 bp) is possible by introducing the Cas9 RNPs and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) with 50 bp upstream and downstream homology sequence arms of the target site (Nomura et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nssODNs were synthesized by IDT, and a 200 μM solution was prepared with nuclease-free duplex buffer (IDT)\nFor electroporation, 2 μL of RNP complex solution and 1 μL of 200 μM ssODN stock solution were added to 47 μL of the E. gracilis suspension.\nNote: It is possible to rewrite the target base using an ssODN containing the nucleotide substitutions. In this case, to prevent re-cleavage by Cas9 RNPs, two or more base mismatches are required in the seed region of the target sequence in ssODN.\nDetection of Targeted Mutagenesis\nTiming: 3 h or more\nFor the detection of mutagenesis at on-target sites in Cas9 RNP-introduced E. gracilis, a T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) mismatch cleavage assay was performed using an Alt-R Genome Editing Detection Kit (IDT).",
    "The DNA template was extracted from the small E. gracilis cells pellet (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A) using a Kaneka Easy DNA Extraction Kit v.2 (Kaneka).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/70-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Example of T7 Endonuclease I Mismatch Cleavage Assay\nSmall E. gracilis cells pellet after recovery culture for DNA extraction (A) and example of T7E1 assay results (B).\nNote: Alternatively, another DNA extraction kit can be used.\nDNA fragments, including the target sites, were amplified by Tks Gflex DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio) using the specific primer set.\nUsing the amplified DNA fragments, the T7EI treatment was performed according to the product manufacturer’s instructions.\nThe digested DNA fragments were monitored using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nNote: Because T7EI does not recognize single-base indels, the T7EI assay estimates a lower editing efficiency rate.\nPure-Line (Single-Cell-Derived Clone) Isolation from a Single E. gracilis Cell\nTiming: 1 week or more\nThis step describes how to obtain a single-cell-derived clone in E. gracilis.\nFollowing electroporation after 24–72 h culture in KH medium, a single cell was isolated using a micro pick-and-place system (Nepa Gene) (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A and 7B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/70-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Procedure of Pure-Line Isolation from Single Cell of E. gracilis\nA single E. gracilis cell isolation using a micro pick-and-place system (A and B), Culture from isolated single E. gracilis cell (C and D).\nNote: Contamination can be suppressed by using KH medium at pH 3.5 for culture.\nGenotyping by Sanger Sequencing\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step describes Sanger sequencing for genotyping of E. gracilis.\nThe DNA template was extracted from a 5–10-μL cell pellet volume of E. gracilis using the Kaneka Easy DNA Extraction Kit v.2 (Kaneka).\nDNA fragments, including the target sites, were amplified by Tks Gflex DNA Polymerase using the specific primer set for target site.",
    "Note: A PCR product length of approximately 500–1000 bp is suitable for genotyping.\nTo clone the PCR products, we used a CloneJET PCR cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nColonies were then selected with the vector containing the insert DNA by colony PCR.\nEach plasmid was extracted using a plasmid DNA extraction Mini Kit (FAVORGEN), and sequences were determined using Sanger sequencing."
