    "1. Construct the Flight Mill\nConstruct the acrylic plastic support structure:\nCut 3 mm thick transparent acrylic sheets into the two outside vertical walls, the one central vertical wall and the five horizontal shelves as specified by the design shown in Figure 1.\nAssemble by inserting the shelves (Figures 1 and 2; HS) into vertical walls (Figures 1 and 2; OW and CW) to form the support structure (Figure 2A).\nStrengthen the structure by inserting polystyrene columns at the external corners at the back of the device (Figure 2A and Figure 2C). If required, glue short pieces of right-angled edge-protectors along the central vertical wall junctions to provide additional support for the horizontal shelves.\nConstruct the pivoting arm assembly:\nGlue a 5 cm length of 1 cm diameter plastic tubing into the top center of each cell. Glue a 2 cm length of 1 cm diameter plastic tubing into the bottom center of each cell, making sure the top and bottom tubing in each cell is aligned. Using hot glue, affix two 10 mm x 4 mm N42 neodymium magnets to the end of each support, forming the magnetic bearing for the mill's arm.\nInsert an entomological pin into a 20 µl pipette tip and fix in place with hot glue. Position the pin such that both ends extend out of the pipette tip to form the armature of the flight mill.\n\t\tNote: During the flight trials, the top of the pin is held in place by the top set of magnets. The bottom set of magnets is to maintain the armature in a vertical position, allowing it to revolve around its axis.",
    "Cut a 24 cm length of 19 gauge non-magnetic hypodermic steel tubing. Using hot glue, affix the center point to the top of the pipette tip from step 1.2.2. Bend one end of the tubing at 2 cm from the end to an angle of 95°, leaving a long arm of 12 cm from the center point and a short arm with a 10 cm radius from the center to the bend (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNote: The radius length can be varied in order to accommodate different revolution distances.\nSet up the IR sensor and data logger:\nFix the IR sensors to the eternal sides of each cell using reusable adhesive putty, allowing the sensor to extend into the cell through the openings cut into the external vertical wall supports (Figure 2C).\nConnect the IR sensors to a data loggers through a very basic electronic circuit built on a solderless breadboard (Figure 3). Connect two resistors of 180 Ω and 2.2 kΩ respectively on the input and output of the IR connection on the breadboard (Figure 3A,B). Place the resistors in alternate rows along the breadboard to minimize drops in the voltage signal during recording from multiple sensors (see Figure 3C).\n2. Flight Trials\nTether insects to the flight mill arm indirectly through an insect pin:\nPlace a small foil flag at the end of the unbent end of the pivoting arm to maximize disruption of the IR beam in the sensor and to act as a counterweight.\nDepending on the insect’s size and cuticle area available for attachment, attach the experimental insect to an insect pin with reusable adhesive putty or non-toxic skin glue. If necessary, anesthetize the insect by either chilling or with CO2.",
    "Mould a small amount of adhesive putty around the rounded tip of an entomological pin and cover it with a drop of non-toxic skin glue. Gently apply on the pronotum area and wait 5-10s until the glue is dry.\n\t\tNote: The procedure in step 2.1.3 is suited for insects with hard (beetle, bugs) or soft (wasps, flies) cuticle. Insects with hairy cuticle (moths, butterflies) will need to have the hair gently removed with a very fine paintbrush before tethering.\nInsert the pin with the insect attached into the bent end of the pivoting arm assembly.\nAfter the flight test has ended, remove the tethering with a fine forcep.\n\t\tNote: Data logger set up and acquisition has been optimized as follows for the specific equipment listed in the materials table and should be adjusted for use with alternative equipment. \nInitiate a recording session with the freely available WinDAQ Lite software\nDownload and install the free software WinDAQ Lite (see equipment list).\nOpen the instrument hardware manager, select the data-logger from the pop-up list and press 'Start Windaq'. A new window will open and the input signal from each sensor will be shown.\nSelect the desired sampling frequency at which the data-logger reads and displays the sensor’s output.\n\t\tNote: The sampling frequency will depend on the insect's flight speed, however sampling frequencies ranging between 30-45 Hz will be fast enough to capture the flight of small-medium sized insects.\nPress Ctrl-F4 to start a recording session. Select the destination path of the recording file in the first pop-up window. Choose the appropriate length of time to record flight for the particular insect and experiment. Define recording time in the second pop-up window. Once the recording time is elapsed press Ctrl-S to finalize the recorded file.\nCheck quality of the recording.",
    "Open the recorded flight track and select a voltage channel. Press Ctrl-T to open a pop-up window with the voltage statistics for each channel.\nEnsure that no large drops in minimums value resulted from voltage drops across the circuit (Figure 4). Discard any channels in which the difference between the channel average and minimum voltage is greater than 0.1 V.\nSave the file in a *.CSV format: Go to File > Save as and in the pop-up window select “Spreadsheet print (CSV)”. In the “Spreadsheet Comments” pop-up window select “Relative Time” and deselect all the other options. Click OK to save the file.\n3. Analysis of Flight Data using Python 3.4.x\nInstall the latest Python 3.4.x version. Download the archive Python_scripts.zip[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53377/Python_scripts.zip] (Supplemental Files), open it, and save standardize_peaks.py and flight_analysis.py onto the desktop.\nStandardize and select the peaks in the recorded signal as follows\nRight-click on the standardize_peaks.py icon. Select 'Open with IDLE'.\n\t\tNote: IDLE is the default editor for Python, but any text editor can be used for this purpose.\nIn Lines 18-19, specify the threshold values around the mean voltage used to perform the standardization of the voltage signal for each channel.\n\t\tNote: The default values are set to deliver a fine tune signal standardization, but the user can define any desired threshold according to the value of the mean voltage for each channel. These can be found in the voltage statistics window (see step 2.3).\nIn line 45, type the path to the folder in which the recorded *.CSV file is saved.\nIn line 91, type the path to the folder in which you wish to record the *.TXT peak file.",
    "In line 61 and line 72, specify the number of channels needed. Add or delete channels by deleting the # at the beginning of line 61-63 and 72-74 up to a maximum of 8 channels.\nSave the file and launch the script by pressing F5.\nEnter the name of the *.CSV file (with any additional sub-folders) in to the pop-up window and press return to save a new *.TXT file with the standardized signals in the specified folder.\n\t\tNote: Depending on the number of channels used n, this file contains n+1 columns: the first column is the relative time of the sampling event, the other n columns represent the base and peaks events from the n channels used for the recording. A value of 0 represents the base voltage, while a value of 1 represents a peak derived from the passage of the flag through the IR sensor.\nAnalyze the flight track using the standardized file: Edit the flight_analysis.py script to accommodate the user experimental conditions:\n\t\nRight click on the flight_analysis.py icon. Select 'Open with IDLE'.\nIn line 39 and line 80 adjust the length of the circular flight path according to the arm radius.\nIf required, activate an optional speed correction loop by deleting the # in lines 50-52. Change speed value accordingly.\nIn line 77 and line 85, edit the speed threshold and the time gap values to correct for false speed readings in the flight track and account for very short time gaps occurring between two consecutive long uninterrupted flying bouts.\nIn line 198, specify the total recording time in seconds. Change the value ranges in the output lines from line 287 onwards.",
    "Note: The default ranges can be modified according to the user experimental requirements. In order to do so, all the numerical values inside the function (included the ones in the variable name, for example in the variable “flight_300_900”) need to be changed to the desired value.\nIn line 248 type the path to the folder in which the *.txt standardized file is saved.\nSpecify the number of channels. Add or delete channels by adding or deleting a # at the beginning of lines 257-259, lines 270-272 and lines 279-281 up to a maximum of 8 channels.\nIn line 304 type the path to the folder in which you wish to save the output files.\nOnce all the user settings are specified, save the file and launch the script by pressing F5.\nEnter the name of the *.TXT file to analyze (with any additional sub-folders) in the pop-up window and press return."
