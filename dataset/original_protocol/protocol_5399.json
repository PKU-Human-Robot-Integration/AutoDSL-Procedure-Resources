    "Preparation of oligonucleotidesDissolve the 5’ amino modified microarray probes to 100 µM in nuclease-free water.Dissolve the 33-plex PCR primers to 100 µM in nuclease-free water, then create a 100 µM primer mix by pipetting equal volume of all 66 primers (e.g., 6 µl each) into one 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Dissolving and phosphorylation of the padlock probes (Note 8).Dissolve the padlock probes to 200 µM in nuclease-free water, then create a 2 µM per probe Master mix by pipetting 1 volume of padlock probe (e.g., 66 x 10.00 µl) and 0.34 volumes of nuclease-free water (e.g., 66 x 10.00 x 0.515 = 340.00 µl in total) into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.Phosphorylation of the padlock probe Master mix is done by combining 10 µl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (0.2 U/µl final conc.), 50 µl of 10x reaction buffer A (1x final conc.), 50 µl of 10 mM ATP (1 mM final conc.), 250 µl of the padlock probe mix (1 µM per probe final conc.) and 140 µl PCR-grade water (final volume 500 µl).Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C, then for 10 min at 65 °C.Store microarray probes, padlock probes, primers and the respective master mixes at -20 °C.Growth of bacterial cells and preparation of genomic DNA extracts (Note 5)Inoculate a pure culture (e.g., from a glycerol stock) or a clinical isolate (e.g., from an agar culture) in approx. 5 ml CASO medium (see Recipes) in a 15 ml Falcon tube (Note 6). Do not completely screw the cap to allow for proper aeration of the bacteria.Incubate samples for 14-18 h at 37 °C in an orbital shaking incubator at 300 rpm (Note 7).Vortex the Falcon tube and transfer 2 ml of the culture to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube.",
    "Pellet the bacteria by centrifugation for 5 min at 2,400 x g at room temperature.Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml 1x PBS (see Recipes).Centrifuge the suspension for 5 min at 2,400 x g at room temperature.Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml sterile ddH2O and transfer to a 2 ml screw-cap tube suitable for the MagNA Lyser.Add acid-washed beads of 150-212 µm and acid-washed beads of 425-600 µm diameter at equal volumes to the tube, so that the beads make up about one third of the tube.Disrupt the bacterial and fungal cells using a MagNA Lyser for 30 sec at 6,500 rpm at room temperature.Leave sample 5 min at room temperature.Repeat step A9 once.For thermal lysis, incubate the sample for 20 min at 95 °C in a thermomixer.Centrifuge for 10 min at maximum speed.Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Microarray processingPrepare the Ritter 384-well spotting plate by adding 18 µl of the 2x spotting buffer (see Recipes) to every well to be used, and then add 18 µl of microarray oligonucleotide to every well (final concentration of every oligonucleotide is now 50 µM in 1x spotting buffer). Take note of which oligonucleotides are in which wells and how your spotter transfers the oligonucleotides to the glass slides (Note 4).Set the Omnigrid contact arrayer to an air humidity of 60% and set up the machine to print the oligonucleotides in 4 replicates per slide (Notes 9 and 10).Spot the oligonucleotides onto glass slides with aldehyde surface using SMP3 pins which produce spots with 100 µm in diameter.After spotting, allow the oligonucleotides to attach for approx. 5 h in the humid atmosphere.The glass slides are not washed after spotting.Store the slides at room temperature.Species identification16S rRNA gene PCRPrepare the PCR master mix in 0.",
    "2 ml PCR tubes for n + 1 reactions, using the Molzym Mastermix 16S Basic kit, according to Table 1. Include at least one negative control (NTC) where you replace the genomic DNA extract with water. A primer mix consisting of equal quantities of all four primers at 15 µM can be prepared in advance to avoid repetitive pipetting. In this case, 1.20 µl of the primer mix is used. Keep samples chilled on ice until they are placed into the thermal cycler (Note 11).Table 1. Multiplex PCR Master mix for 16S rRNA gene identificationimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170810/20170810020837_2335.jpgRun this reaction in parallel with ‘33-plex pre-amplification PCR for β-lactamase-encoding gene identification’ using the PCR program outlined in Table 2 in a thermal cycler with heated lid (Figure 2).Keep the samples at 4 °C after the PCR run is finished.Table 2.

Schematic illustration of the detection principle of the assay. For the species identification, the 16S rRNA gene is amplified using universal 16S primers (A1). Subsequently, the PCR products are labeled using a linear PCR and Cy5-modified cytosines (A2). In parallel, β-lactamase genes are pre-amplified in a 33-plex PCR (B1). Then, the padlock probes are hybridized (B2) and ligated (B3) using the β-lactamase PCR products as template and amplified in a first rolling circle amplification (RCA) (B4). The RCA products comprise a C2CA sequence and corresponding 16S rRNA barcode sequences. In a next reaction, the RCA products are monomerized (B5) using a restriction enzyme and circularized (B6) to serve as a new template for a second RCA (B7). These C2CA products are labelled in a linear PCR reaction using Atto532-modified cytosines (B8).",
    "Finally, the labelled amplification products from the 16S rRNA gene PCR and from the multiplex padlock assay are pooled together and hybridized to a microarray detecting the products at two different fluorescence wavelengths (C).Linear PCR for labelling of the PCR productsPrepare the linear PCR master mix in 0.2 ml PCR tubes for n + 1 reactions according to Table 3 with the PCR products from the previous PCR.
