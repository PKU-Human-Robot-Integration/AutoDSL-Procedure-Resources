    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRNA isolation, cDNA transcription and PCR of LDB3\nTiming: 3–4 h\nRNA isolation and cDNA synthesis (including the gDNA digestion) is followed by semi-quantitative PCR for LDB3.\nRNA-isolation of 60–90 days old iPSC-CM For RNA isolation, use the ReliaPrep RNA Tissue Kit. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for “Protocol for Isolation of RNA from Fibrous Tissue “ (see page 3 and 4, ReliaPrep RNA Tissue Miniprep System FB145.pdf) except for the DNAse I digestion step. Perform the following steps:\nDissolve the cell pellet in 500 μL lysis buffer by pipetting.\nAdd 500 μL dilution buffer and vortex for 10 s.\nCentrifuge 3 min at 10.000 g.\nTransfer supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube and add 340 μL isopropanol.\nMix by vortexing for 10 s and transfer the solution onto the QiaAmp column.\nWash the column twice with 500 μL washing buffer (centrifuge 1 min at 16.000 g and discard flow-through)\nPlace column into a new 1.5 mL tube and add 40–50 μL water directly onto the membrane and incubate 5 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge 1 min at 16.000 g and discard the column.\nDetermine RNA concentration with a Nanodrop. Dilute the RNA with water if the concentration is higher than 200 ng/μL.\ngDNA digestion and cDNA synthesis.\nDilute 100 ng RNA in 13 μL water.\nAdd 2 μL gDNA Removal Mix and incubate 2 min at 45°C.\nAdd 5 μL RT mix (consisting of 4 μL RT mix and 1 μL RT enzyme).\nIncubate with the following program for cDNA synthesis\n3 min at 25°C\n10 min at 45°C\n5 min at 85°C",
    "Note: The RT enzyme, gDNA Removal, and RT mix are provided by the QuantiNova RT Kit. Here, the SensoquestLabcycler was used, but any programmable thermocycler can be employed for this step.\nPCR of LDB3\nPrepare 25 μL PCR reaction mix:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1366_2.csv\nRun PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1366_3.csv\nNote: Since the PCR product is expected to be 766 bp (if every exon/nucleotide is included), the extension time is 1 min (1000 bp/min for Taq polymerase).\nGel electrophoresis and gel extraction of suitable PCR products\nTiming: 3–4 h\nRun the PCR products on an agarose gel to visualize the different splice products of LDB3.\nGel electrophoresis\nFollowing the PCR, separate the products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Dissolve 1.5 g of agarose in 100 mL 1×TBE buffer (1.5% agarose gel) and boil in a microwave until the solution is clear. Add 9 μL of Midori Green to the solution and pour it into a gel casting chamber. Leave the gel to cool and harden at room temperature for 30–45 min.\nNote: The percentage of agarose in the gel is dependent on the expected size of the PCR bands.\nPlace the gel onto the tray of the electrophoresis chamber and fill the chamber with 1×TBE buffer fully covering the gel. Load the gel with 20 μL of the samples and a DNA page ruler. Connect the chamber to the power supply and perform the electrophoresis at 120 V for 90 min.\nGel extraction with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit",
    "Remove the gel from the casting chamber and place it onto the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager ChemiDoc™ XRS (or any other Imager capable of taking images at UV-lighting). In the case of LDB3, two bands at approximately 700 bp and 250 bp become visible (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Place the gel onto a UV-transilluminator and excise the bands under UV-lighting and transfer them into 2 mL tubes. Extract the PCR products using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions (see https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=a72e2c07-7816-436f-b920-98a0ede5159a&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=a72e2c07-7816-436f-b920-98a0ede5159a&lang=en]) and elute the DNA from the QIAquick column with 25 μL nuclease-free water.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1366-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. DNA bands after PCR amplification of LDB3 using primer “LDB3 exon 4–7” for semi-quantitative RT-PCR (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) on an agarose gel\nThe two bands were excised from the gel, and the DNA bands were purified for Sanger sequencing. Sequencing results in combination with Clustalomega-based blasting demonstrated exons 4, 5, 6, 7 in the upper band and exons 4, 6, 7 in the lower band.\nNote: Additional purification steps for better sequencing results are included in the instructions of the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.\nPause point: Bands cut out from the gel can be stored at −20 °C for indefinite periods.\nSanger sequencing of PCR products and blast analysis\nTiming: 24 h\nThe PCR products are sequenced to determine which exons are included.\nSanger sequencing of the extracted DNA\nSend 20 μL from the extracted DNA for Sanger sequencing analysis with the LDB3-exon 4 forward primer to Microsynth (Göttingen).\nNote: The DNA concentration can range between 10–100 ng/μL with the Microsynth service provider.\nAlternatives: Any other sequencing provider can be used.",
    "Blast of the sequencing data For this, the Clustal Omega webpage is used (Clustal Omega < Multiple Sequence Alignment <EMBL-EBI). Select “DNA” in the first line and subsequently paste the nucleotide sequence of human LDB3 locus as the first query in the sequences window. Use a “space” to paste the nucleotide sequence obtained from Sanger sequencing of the PCR bands underneath the first query. Use “>” before each query. Press “Submit”.\nBlast the longer sequence (upper band from the gel) against the human LDB3 sequence and align at LDB3 exon 4, 5, 6 and 7 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nBlast the shorter sequence (lower band from the gel) against the human LDB3 sequence and align with LDB3 exon 4, 5, 6 and 7. In this transcript exon 5 is not included (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCritical: Check, if the sequencing results match with the observation of the PCR-bands on the agarose gel. Here, the bands are approximately 400 bp apart. Exon 5 has a described length of 368 bp, which corresponds to the observation on the agarose gel (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nDesign qPCR primers for expression of specific LDB3 exons\nDesign primers for qPCR to quantify mRNA transcripts including exon 5 (spanning exons 4 and 5) and primers against constitutive exons (spanning exons 3 and 4) to determine whole LDB3 expression for normalization (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for details of primer sequences).\nNote: For all primer designs, the NCBI Primer-BLAST webpage is used (Primer designing tool https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/]).\nQ-PCR of LDB3\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThe RBM20-dependent exon 5 in LDB3 is quantified using qPCR and normalized against a constitutively expressed exon of LDB3.\nQPCR of LDB3",
