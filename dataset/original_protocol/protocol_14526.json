    "NOTE: The reader is reminded that all research involving human subjects must be approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the Use of Human Subjects in Research. Research participants must be informed of the purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits of the proposed research; the availability of alternative treatments or procedures; the availability of remuneration; and of their rights to privacy and to withdraw their consent and discontinue their participation. Prior to the MRI testing session, an investigator must present a potential research participant with an IRB-approved informed consent document (ICD), explain its contents, and ask the potential research participant if he/she wishes to participate in the study. If so, the participant will have to sign and date the ICD prior to completing any of the steps of the protocol here.\n1. Actions Prior to the Day of Testing\nRestrict Lifestyle Habits that Could Confound the Data\nInstruct the participant not to perform moderate or heavy exercise during the 48 h prior to testing. Instruct the participant to abstain from over-the-counter medication and alcohol intake during the 24 h prior to testing. Instruct the participant to refrain from tobacco use or caffeine consumption during the 6 h prior to testing.\nPrior to testing, confirm that the participant has been compliant with these instructions.\nPrepare the MRI System\nEnsure the availability of all necessary equipment, as listed in the Table of Materials and Equipment.\nDefine an MRI protocol; suggested parameters are found in Tables 1 - 5.\n2. Day of Testing: Prepare for MRI Data Acquisition\nConduct Safety Screening\nScreen for potential hazards in the MRI environment by having an MRI safety-trained healthcare worker present the research participant with a suitable MRI safety form, such as that found at www.mrisafety.com.",
    "If there any implanted magnetic or magnetically sensitive objects, ensure that they are safe for MRI scanning.\nPrepare the MRI System\nEnsure that all personnel have removed all magnetic and magnetically sensitive objects before entering the room that houses the MRI system. Conduct this check every time that someone enters the MRI room.\nPrepare the MRI system by placing the receive coil on the patient bed of the MRI system. Also, place a mattress with sheet and pillow with pillowcase on the bed. Have straps available to place around the thighs and bolsters or pillows to place under the knees.\nStart the software interface, enter patient data, and open the imaging protocol.\nPosition the Research Participant on the MRI Scanner Table\nObserve the research participant as he/she checks his/her person and clothing for magnetically sensitive objects. Secure these objects outside of the MRI room in a lockable container. Enter the MRI room with the research participant immediately after completing this step.\nPosition the participant on the patient bed in a supine, feet-first position. Place the body part to be imaged as close to the midline of the table as practical. Place bolsters or pillows under the knees to provide strain relief for the lower back and place a pillow under the head. To limit motion, gently but effectively secure the thigh, leg, and feet and ensure that the participant is comfortable.\nPlace the RF receiver coil around the participant's thighs and connect it to the MRI system.\nInstruct the Participant and Complete Final Pre-testing Steps\nGive instructions about how to communicate with the investigators. Provide the participant with hearing protection and a signaling device that can be used to call for attention if needed. Instruct the participant of the need to stay still during and between all imaging sequences.",
    "Advance the patient bed into the MRI scanner such that the body part to be imaged is aligned to the center of the MRI scanner.\nAfter exiting the MRI room, confirm that the patient communication system is working and see that the participant is comfortable. Throughout the protocol, communicate regularly with the participant to ensure his/her comfort and compliance with instructions.\n3. Day of Testing: Acquire the MRI Data\nPreparatory Steps\nAs the MRI system determines the instrumental settings and calibrations prior to each imaging sequence (center frequency, receiver gain calibration, etc.), supervise these processes and ensure that each step is being performed correctly.\nUsing a suitable software interface, acquire a set of localizer images (also known as pilot or scout images); using suggested parameters presented in Table 2.\nDetermine where to place the center slice for qMRI data acquisitions, by identifying areas of damage and/or by referencing the slice position relative to reproducible anatomical landmarks.\nTransmit and Receive Coil Calibration Steps\nFor these steps as well as all of the subsequent imaging steps, define region of anatomy in which to optimize the homogeneity of the static magnetic field (B0), a process known as \"shimming\". See Figure 1A for the typical placement of the shimming volume of interest (VOI) used in the present studies.\nIf the MRI scanner has a multi-element transmission coil, acquire an RF calibration dataset.\nIf the MRI scanner has a multi-element receive coil, acquire a spatial sensitivity map of the coils.\nAcquire Structural MRI Data\nAcquire high resolution, multi-slice, T1-weighted images using a fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence; the imaging parameters used in the present studies are provided in Table 1.\nAcquire high resolution, multi-slice, T2-weighted images using an FSE sequence; the imaging parameters used in the present studies are provided in Table 2.",
    "Acquire Data for Real-time Quality Control and Making Post-processing Corrections\nAcquire three-dimensional (3D) multiple gradient-echo data for the calculation of B0 field maps. The imaging parameters used in the present studies are provided in Table 3.\nExamine the field maps to ensure that there are no deviations of greater than ±60 Hz (approximately 0.5 parts per million at 3 Tesla) across the image. If there are, adopt an alternative approach to shimming (different method, different placement of VOI, etc.).\nAcquire 3D data for the calculation of nutation angle maps. The imaging parameters used in the present studies are provided in Table 2.\nExamine the field maps to ensure that there are no areas that deviate excessively from the nominal nutation angle. For the RF pulses that are used in this protocol, deviations greater than ± 30% of the nominal nutation angle are considered excessive.\nAcquire the qMRI Data\nAcquire 3D images for calculation of the T1, using an inversion recovery sequence. The imaging parameters used in the present studies are presented in Table 3.\nRepeat the T1 measurement in the presence of fat signal suppression (FS; this parameter is abbreviated T1,FS).\nAcquire single-slice images for calculation of the T2, using a multiple spin-echo sequence. Use the imaging parameters presented in Table 3.\nRepeat the T2 measurement in the presence of FS (T2,FS).\nAcquire 3D images for calculation of qMT parameters, using a pulsed saturation sequence with FS and the imaging parameters given in Table 4.\nAcquire multi-slice data for calculation of diffusion-tensor parameters, using a series of diffusion-weighted images. The imaging parameters used in these studies are given in Table 4.\nAcquire 3D data for calculation of fat/water images, using a series of six gradient-echo images. The imaging parameters used in these studies are given in Table 5.",
    "After Completing the qMRI Protocol\nEnsure that all images are of suitable quality by examining them for potentially correctable artifacts and by measuring the sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.\nFor each qMRI dataset, define several regions of interest (ROIs) in the image series and examine the signal as a function of the relevant parameter (for example, for the T1-dependent data acquired in steps 3.5.1 and 3.5.2, plot the signal as a function of TI and ensure that the data follow the inversion-recovery function listed below in step 4.1.2).\nAfter completing a personal screening for magnetically sensitive objects, enter the MRI room. Remove the participant from the magnet, remove all straps and padding, and assist the participant in exiting the MRI scanner and the MRI room.\nTransfer the data, using methods compliant with local health privacy laws, to a local workstation for processing; data may be exported as Digital Imaging Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files or in the vendor's proprietary format (the method used in this protocol).\n4. Analyze the qMRI Data\nCalculate the Parametric Maps\nUse a computer program designed for scientific computing and image analysis. By examining a histogram of the signal intensities in the image, form a signal threshold-based image mask that delineates areas of signal from areas of noise. Complete the steps below for every pixel in the signal portions of the images.\nAnalyze the T1 data by measuring the signal intensity S for each inversion time (TI). Then, fit the values for S to an inversion-recovery with reduced pre-delay model:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52352/52352equation1.jpg\n\t\twhere M0 is a signal intensity representing the magnetization at the equilibrium state, Sf is the inversion ratio, and TD is the pre-delay time. Then, fit the data with FS to the same model, allowing determination of the longitudinal relaxation time constant with FS, T1,FS.",
    "Analyze theT2 data by measuring S at each TE. Then, fit the data to a mono-exponential decay model:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52352/52352equation2.jpg\n\t\twhere N is the signal offset at baseline. The reader may also decide to fit the data to a multi-exponential model, such as that below:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52352/52352equation3.jpg\n\t\twhere J is the number of exponential components and f and T2,j are the signal fraction and T2 values associated with the jth component. Or, the reader may use a non-negative least squares (NNLS) method3. In the latter case, the Multi-exponential Relaxation Analysis (MERA) toolbox33 is freely available; other programs are available too. Repeat these analyses for the data with and without FS.\nTo analyze the qMT data, measure S for each irradiation power and frequency offset. Correct the nominal irradiation powers (represented by ω1 in the equation below) using the nutation angle maps. Correct the frequency offsets (Δf in the equation below) by using the B0 maps to adjust the applied offset frequencies. Then, fit the data to the following model34,35\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52352/52352equation4.jpg\n\t\twhere is the exchange rate from the macromolecular pool to the free water pool, is the longitudinal relaxation rate of the free water pool, is the longitudinal relaxation rate of the macromolecular pool (assumed to be 1 s-1), is the PSR, is the T2 of the free water pool, and ω1CWPE is the average power of the saturation pulse. The saturation rate of the longitudinal magnetization of the macromolecular pool, is described by a super-Lorentzian model, as described in work by Henkelman and colleagues34,35.",
    "To analyze the DTI data, first use an affine transformation algorithm36 to register each diffusion-weighted image to the corresponding non-diffusion weighted image. Then, for each pixel, measure the values for S in the non-diffusion weighted image and in each diffusion-weighted direction. Form a matrix composed of the diffusion encoding directions. Using multivariate, weighted least squares regression, regress the signal data on the diffusion encoding matrix and form D. Diagonalize D and perform a magnitude-sorting of the eigenvalues and their eigenvectors. Then calculate the mean diffusivity (MD) as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52352/52352equation5.jpg\n\t\twhere λ1, λ2, and λ3 are the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor. Also calculate the fractional anisotropy (FA) as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52352/52352equation6.jpg\n\t\t \nAnalyze the FWMRI data using a quantitative approach that separates water and fat signals based on chemical shift (such as the FattyRiot algorithm, available for free download from https://github.com/welcheb/FattyRiot).\nDefine Regions of Interest for Analysis\nSpecify ROIs on the anatomical images (by defining the boundaries of each muscle of interest). An example is shown in Figure 1.\nResize the ROIs to match the matrix size of the qMRI images. As necessary, adjust the alignment of the ROIs to match the qMRI map (for example, if the participant moved between acquisitions, a translation of the ROI position might be required to avoid overlapping the muscle boundaries).\nExamine each ROI. If necessary, ensure that no pixels are included that contain partial volume artifacts, non-contractile tissue, and flow artifacts; please see Figure 1 for examples.\nCalculate the mean and standard deviation of the qMRI values in all pixels within the selected ROIs.\nSubscription Required.
