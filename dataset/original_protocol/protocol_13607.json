    "Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Columbia University Medical Center's approvals were obtained for all methods described. Wild-type C57Bl/6 male postnatal day 10 mice were used for the study.\n1. Preparation of Langendorff apparatus\nTo minimize complexity, use non-recirculating oxygenated perfusate within the Langendorff apparatus (see Table of Materials) via constant flow or constant pressure.\n\t\nUse Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB), containing 120 mmol/L of NaCl, 4.7 mmol/L of KCl, 1.2 mmol/L of MgSO4, 1.2 mmol/L of KH2PO4, 1.25 mmol/L of CaCl2, 25 mmol/L of NaHCO3, and 11 mmol/L of glucose at pH 7.4 (see Table of Materials), equilibrate with 95% of O2 and 5% of CO2 within the Langendorff apparatus and maintain at 37 °C.\nFor the constant flow approach, maintain a continuous flow rate at ~2.5 mL∙min-1.\n\tNOTE: This flow rate will approximate coronary flow of ~75-80 mL/g∙min, given that the average weight of a 10 day old (P10) mouse heart is ~30 mg17,18.\n2. Fabrication of aortic cannula\nFabricate the newborn mouse aortic cannula from a 26 G stainless steel needle (see Table of Materials). Using sharp scissors, cut off the tip of the needle to blunt the end. Take care not to crimp or restrict the diameter of the needle lumen. Smooth the cut edge and remove any burs by gently scraping the blunted end on the laboratory benchtop using a to-and-fro motion.\n\tNOTE: Microscopic burs and sharp edges must be removed because they can tear the newborn mouse aorta and damage the aortic valve. Alternatively, use fine-grit sandpaper.\nAttach the fabricated cannula to the Langendorff apparatus and assess flow and resistance. Measure flow rates through the cannula by collecting and measuring buffer quantity over a known time period. Ensure actual flow is equal to the set flow rate of 2.5 mL min-1.",
    "Quantify the pressure differential across the cannula with KHB flowing by following the steps below.\n\t\nMeasure pressure in the system with and without the fabricated cannula attached.\nDivide pressure differential across cannula by the flow rate to obtain cannula resistance as per Ohm's law15.\nEnsure that the fabricated cannula resistance comprises ~16.0 ± 1.9 mmHg∙min∙mL-1 of the total resistance6. Excessive resistance suggests a potentially compromised cannula lumen.\n\t\tNOTE: Sample calculation: Pwith cannula - P without cannula = ΔP. If Pwith = 48 and Pwithout = 8 then ΔP = 40. At a flow rate (Q) of 2.5 mL min-1 and ΔP of 40 cannula resistance equals 16 mmHg∙min∙mL-1 using R = ΔP/Q = 40 / 2.5 = 16.\nRemove the 26 G cannula and attach the high-pressure tubing (see Table of Materials) to the cannulation site on the Langendorff apparatus. Attach the aortic cannula to the distal end of the tubing. De-air the tubing and the cannula with oxygenated buffer, ensuring that all bubbles are removed.\n\tNOTE: The use of high-pressure tubing in this manner permits the cannula to be extended to a more remote position. This is necessary to allow aortic cannulation with a dissecting microscope adjacent to the setup (Figure 1).\n3. Organ harvesting\nAnticoagulate mice via intraperitoneal (IP) injection of heparin (10 kU/kg) (see Table of Materials) to prevent the formation of coronary microthrombi using a 26 G needle on 1 mL syringe. Allow several minutes for heparin to circulate before proceeding with the injection of any anesthetic.\nAnesthetize the animal with an IP injection using a 26 G needle on 1 mL syringe.",
    "NOTE: It is essential to carefully monitor the animal after anesthetic injection to avoid apnea and subsequent hypoxia. Pentobarbital (70 mg/kg) is a reliable choice of anesthetic, as it allows for rapid onset of sedation without inducing apnea19,20. Other anesthetic agents can be utilized, provided that the doses used do not cause apnea21. Investigators should consider the effects of alternative sedative-hypnotics on cardiac function22,23. Cervical dislocation as a primary mode of euthanasia may prolong pre-cannulation hypoxia and ischemia.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position and secure limbs immediately upon loss of consciousness. Use small gauge hypodermic needles to secure each limb. Begin harvesting as soon as the animal is unresponsive to toe pinch; the animal should breathe spontaneously during the initial dissection.\nMake a transverse subxiphoid incision across the animal's width to expose the abdominal cavity using straight dissecting scissors (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Sterile technique is not necessary given that the procedure represents nonsurvival surgery.\n\t\nIdentify the diaphragm superiorly and incise the anterior portion completely. Cut the ribcage bilaterally along the mid-axillary line in a cephalad direction. Ask an assistant to grasp the xiphoid process with forceps and reflect the sternum and ribs cranially to expose the thoracic organs.\nIdentify the infra-diaphragmatic inferior vena cava (IVC) above the liver. Transect the IVC with a curved iris scissor while maintaining slight anterior and cephalad tension on the proximal segment with iris forceps (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nCut posteriorly along the anterior surface of the spine using curved iris scissors while pulling the IVC up and out of the thoracic cavity. As the heart is mobilized, angle the scissors anteriorly and sever the great vessels superiorly to completely remove the heart and lungs.\n\t\t​NOTE: This method permits rapid explantation of the heart and lungs en bloc.",
    "Immediately submerge the specimen in ice-cold KHB or saline. The heart should stop beating within seconds.\n4. Cannulation\nCut a piece of paper towel and place it at the bottom of a shallow Petri dish to provide friction to stabilize the heart during cannulation. Moisten with ice-cold KHB to prevent the heart from adhering to it.\n\t\nPlace the prepared Petri dish under the dissecting microscope and adjust the focus. Place the aortic cannula attached to the high-pressure extension tubing under the dissecting microscope along with a 5-0 silk suture loosely tied around its hub (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Care must be taken to limit the amount of fluid in the Petri dish because the air-filled lungs can float and cause the excised organs to move.\nPlace the excised thoracic organs in the Petri dish. Under the microscope, identify the thymus by its white sheen and two lobes and orient the specimen such that the thymus is anterior and superior24. This will ensure proper orientation of the heart.\nUsing forceps, bluntly separate the lobes of the thymus to expose the great vessels. Identify the aorta by locating distinguishing branching features of the aortic arch.\n\tNOTE: A dark purple hue often demarcates the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. The ascending aorta is located between the main pulmonary artery and the right atrium.\nTransect the aorta with fine sharp scissors (see Table of Materials) just proximal to the subclavian artery takeoff.\n\tNOTE: If the aorta is transected too close to the aortic valve, there will not be enough aortic tissue to enable the cannula to be secured. Alternatively, if the aorta is transected too high, perfusate can leak out of one or more aortic branches (such as the subclavian artery).",
    "Gently grasp the transected aorta using jeweler-style fine curved forceps (see Table of Materials). Carefully cannulate the aorta with a 26 G blunt needle, taking care not to damage the aortic valve. Hold in place by grasping the aorta with the fine curved forceps around the cannula. Once control of the aorta is established, initiate retrograde perfusion to limit the ischemic time.\n\tNOTE: The heart should begin to beat and will become pale as blood is drained from the myocardium and KHB perfuses the coronary arteries. Failure to spontaneously beat, presence of ventricular engorgement, or lack of color change of the heart indicates a malpositioned cannula.\nAsk the assistant to grasp the ends of the loosely tied suture and carefully ensnare the aorta around the cannula. Cinch the suture above or below the curved fine forceps (holding the cannula in place), depending on the amount of aortic tissue and anatomical considerations. Tighten the suture and confirm the adequacy of coronary flow.\nDisconnect the high-pressure tubing from the Langendorff apparatus. Grasp the hub of the cannula and disconnect the blunt needle from the high-pressure extension tubing. Rapidly attach the hub of the cannula to the apparatus.\n\tNOTE: Care must be taken not to dislodge the heart or entrain air into the cannula.\nOnce the heart is hung on the Langendorff apparatus in the usual position, and adequate perfusion is confirmed, carefully trim off lung, thymus, and excess tissue. Incise the right atrium to permit coronary sinus effluent to drip freely.\n5. Functional measurement",
    "Make a small knot at the end of a 5-0 silk suture (attached to a curved needle). Pierce a small piece of paraffin film (2-3 mm x 2-3 mm) with the needle and slide the paraffin to the knotted end. Carefully pass the needle through the apex of the ventricle and pull the suture through the heart until the paraffin film is snug against the lateral wall of the ventricle.\n\tNOTE: The paraffin film helps to prevent the knot from tearing the heart and pulling through the ventricle.\nPass the needle through the opening of the water-filled warming jacket of the Langendorff apparatus. The heart can now be encased and warmed.\nAttach the needle to the force transducer (see Table of Materials) in such a manner that avoids the coronary sinus drip. Adjust the suture to apply 1-2 g of basal tension, as indicated by the diastolic tension or nadir in tension tracing.\n\tNOTE: Avoid pulling the heart off the cannula or twisting the aorta, thereby compromising coronary perfusion.\nPlace surface electrodes on the superior and inferior poles of the heart to record the electrocardiogram.\n\tNOTE: Use pediatric temporary epicardial pacing wire with the needle removed for flexible surface electrode connected to Bio Amp (see Table of Materials).\nSample the coronary sinus effluent for analysis using a 24 G IV catheter (see Table of Materials).\nSubtract the cannula resistance from the total system resistance to obtain coronary resistance per Kirchhoff's law25.\nSubscription Required.
