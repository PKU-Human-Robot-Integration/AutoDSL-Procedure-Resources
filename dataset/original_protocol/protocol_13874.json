    "All animal studies were approved by the Purdue Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Setup of the low-flow vaporizer\nIsoflurane or sevoflurane delivery\n\t\nSelect a carrier gas source. To utilize the internal air pump, remove the red cap from the Inlet port on the back of the system, allowing the system to intake room air. To use compressed gas, use a pressure regulator or pressure reducer set to 15 PSI, and connect to the Compressed Gas port on the back of the system.\nConnect the charcoal canister to the exhaust port.\nConnect the Accessory Connector to the Inspiratory and Expiratory ports on the front of the system. Connect the induction chamber to branches with blue clips and the nose cone to branches with white clips (Figure 1).\nFor mechanical ventilation\n\t\nConnect the intubation connector tubing to the yellow coded clips (Figure 2).\nCalibrate the ventilator by performing a deadspace calibration. From the Vent Run Screen, touch Setup, and then Calib & Tests. Select Deadspace Calibration and press Dial B.\nFor pulse oximetry\n\t\nConnect the sensor to the port on the back of the system, labeled MouseSTAT.\nFor warming\n\t\nConnect the warming pad to the ‘Pad Power’ port on the front of the system.\nConnect one sensor to the “Body Sensor’ port, and the other to the ‘Pad Sensor’ port. Secure the Pad Sensor to the warming pad.\n2. Configure the settings\nFor anesthesia\n\t\nPower on the anesthesia system. From the Anest Run Screen, touch Set Up.\nChoose the anesthetic agent. Touch Type Anest, and then turn Dial B to select Isoflurane or Sevoflurane.\nSet the syringe size. Touch Syringe Size, and then turn Dial B to select a size.\nTouch Back to return to the Anest Run Screen.\nUsing the bottle top adapter, fill the syringe with anesthetic.",
    "Connect the syringe to the anesthesia system. Touch Remove to move the pusher block backwards if needed.\nPrime the syringe. Touch and hold Prime to move the pusher block forward until the pusher block touches the top of the syringe plunger. Turning B while holding the Prime button regulates the pusher block speed.\nFor mechanical ventilation\n\t\nTouch the Vent Run Screen tab, and then Setup.\nTouch Body Weight and enter the weight of the animal.\nTouch Priority to choose volume or pressure-controlled ventilation. The Body Weight setting automatically sets appropriate respiratory rate and tidal volumes.\nFor pulse oximetry\n\t\nTouch the Oxi Run Screen tab, and then Setup.\nTouch HR and turn Dial B to set the minimum allowed heart rate reading. Presets are available.\nFor warming\n\t\nFrom the Warm Run Screen, touch Setup. Choose a warming method and target temperature setting.\n3. Begin anesthesia delivery\nAnesthetize the mouse\n\t\nFrom the Anest Run Screen, touch Start Induction to begin airflow. The default Induction flow rate is 500 mL/min. Turning Dial A adjusts the flow rate as needed.\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber, closing the lid tightly. Adjust the Anesthetic Agent Concentration dial to 3% for isoflurane.\nMonitor until the mouse has reached the desired anesthetic plane, determined by a decrease in respiration rate and a loss of righting reflex when the chamber is tipped. Adjust the Anesthetic Agent Concentration dial as necessary.\nOnce the animal has lost righting reflex and is sufficiently anesthetized, touch Stop Induction.\nIf desired, touch Flush Chamber to empty the chamber of residual anesthetic gas.\nOpen the clamps leading to the nose cone, and close the clamps leading to the chamber.\nTouch Start Nose Cone. The Body Weight setting determines the nose cone flow rate, though it can be manually adjusted by turning Dial A.",
    "Immediately fit the nose cone, and center the animal on the infrared warming pad.\nInsert the Animal Sensor as a rectal probe.\n4. Begin mechanical ventilation\nIntubate the animal.\n\t\nTransfer the animal to the intubation stage while keeping the animal anesthetized.\nSuspend the animal from its upper incisors using a thread fixed onto the vertical intubation stage (Figure 3).\nGently displace the animal’s tongue to the side and visualize the trachea using the lights provided in the intubation kit.\nCarefully insert tracheal tube and verify correct placement by connecting small air bladder to the tube and checking if the lungs inflate.\nConnect the endotracheal tube to the ventilation tubing.\nTouch Stop Nose Cone, and then touch Start Ventilator.\n\tNOTE: The Body Weight setting automatically determines proper respiration rate and tidal volumes. To perform pressure-controlled ventilation, set the target inspiratory pressure between 15-18 cm H2O. Make adjustments to the ventilator settings as needed per surgical protocols.\n5. Begin physiological monitoring\nPlace the sensor over the hind paw of the animal (Figure 4). The Pulse Oximeter will begin reading HR and SpO2 automatically. Touch the Oxi Run Screen Tab to view pulse oximetry data."
