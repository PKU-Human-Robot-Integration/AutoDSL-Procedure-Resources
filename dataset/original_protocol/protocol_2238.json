Mix well with 20 μL 0.4% trypan blue solution.\nTake out 20 μL of the mixture and add the mixture into the cell counting plate. Place the cell counting plate into the Countstar Automated cell counter and count the cell number.\nNote: 1 × 106 HEK293T cells will be needed for virus producing purpose for 1 × 106 bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells of one infection group.\nDay 1: Transfect HEK293T cells.\nChange the medium of HEK293T cells with 4 mL fresh HEK293T medium before transfection.\nPrepare two 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes, label the tubes with Tube 1 and Tube 2, and then add 250 μL Opti-MEM per tube.\nAdd plasmid and Lipofectamine™ 2000 into each tube according to the list below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1845_8.csv\nMix each tube gently and incubate for 5 min at 24°C.\nCombine tube 2 with tube 1, mix slightly and incubate the mixture for 20 min at 24°C.\nAdd the transfection mixture into HEK293T cells and culture the cells at a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: To obtain higher transfection efficiency, the ideal density of HEK293T cells is of 50%–60% confluence and well adherent.\nDay 2: Insolate BM progenitor cells.",
    "Change medium of transfected HEK293T cells with 4 mL fresh HEK293T medium and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate early in the morning.\nEuthanize donor mice. Disinfect the mice with 70% ethanol. Dissect the tibia and the femur of both rear arms, remove the muscles, adipose and disconnect the joints as much as possible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1845-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of an instant mouse fixation and operation board\n(A) Wrap the foam board with aluminum foil.\n(B) Cover the aluminum foil with 3 layers of paper towels. And then euthanized mouse can be fixed on top of the board for further operations.\nPut the bones into a 60 mm tissue dish containing 4 mL fresh BM washing medium. Flush BM cells into a new 60 mm tissue dish with 3 mL BM washing medium by use of a 3 mL syringe with 25 G 1 1/2 inch needle (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1845-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Harvest the bone marrow (BM) cells\n(A) Dissect the tibias and femurs into a 60 mm tissue culture dish with 4 mL fresh BM washing buffer.\n(B) Flush the BM cells.\n(C and D) Filter the cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer.\nEliminate cell debris and clumps by filtering the cell suspension with a 40 μm cell strainer, and collect the flow-through into a 50 mL centrifuge tube (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). Wash the cell strainer with 1 mL BM washing medium.\nSpin down at 400 g for 8 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets with 20 mL ACK lysis buffer at 4°C for 8 min to remove the red blood cells lysis.\nSpin down at 400 g for 8 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant and add 5 mL MCs buffer to resuspend the cell pellets.\nCount cell numbers.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 400 g for 8 min. Aspirate the supernatant.\nUse Lineage Cell Depletion Kit for magnetic labeling according to the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/CN-en/products/lineage-cell-depletion-kit-mouse.html]. Add 40 μL MCs buffer per 107 total cells to resuspend the cell pellets.\nAdd 10 μL Biotin-Antibody Cocktail per 107 cells and mix well. Incubate at 4°C for 10 min.\nAdd 30 μL MCs buffer and 20 μL Anti-Biotin MicroBeads per 107 total cells and mix well. Incubate at 4°C for 15 min.\nAdd 1 mL MCs buffer per 107 total cells to wash the cells. Spin down at 300 g for 10 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 500 μL MCs buffer per 5 × 107 total cells to resuspend the cell pellets.\nPlace the separation column in a MACS separator device. Rinse the separation column with 500 μL MCs buffer. Transfer the cell suspension to separation column and collect the pass-through.\nWash the separation column with 500 μL MCs buffer for three times.\nCount the enriched progenitor cells. Centrifuge cells at 400 g for 8 min and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellets at a density of 1–5 × 106 cells/mL with progenitor cell culture medium. Culture the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nNote: According to the instruction, the maximum volume of a MS column is 500 μL. According to our experiences, it is expected that one 5-FU injected healthy donor yields 2.5–3.5 × 106 BM cells. Other groups also reported the expected yields were around 3.04 ± 0.79×106 four days after 150 mg/kg 5-FU treatment. (Shaikh et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nDay 3: Infect BM progenitor cells.\nPre-warm the centrifuge at 30°C.\nCritical: It is important to keep the temperature consistently at 30°C to ensure the transfection efficiency and cell survival.",

Keep these cells in another 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nAdd 1 × 106 helper cells per recipient mouse into collection tube containing donor cells.\nCentrifuge the cells mixture at 400 g for 8 min.",

    "Note: Since engraftment (i.e., CD45.1+ population) of 1st BMT recipients at the end point is usually above 85% (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), these BM cells (i.e., 2nd BMT donor cells) are considered to be leukemic cells with malignant expansion, and can be used as 2nd BMT donor cells directly. If the primary recipients’ final engraftment is below 85%, purify the leukemic cells through flow cytometry isolation (see step 20 for details).\nFreeze remaining cells in liquid nitrogen with frozen stock solution.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1845-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.
