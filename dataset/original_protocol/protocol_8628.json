    "1. Microglial Cell Culture Maintenance\nWarm cell culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium; DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin (PSN) to 37 °C.\nObtain frozen stock of BV2 microglial cells at passage 18 - 25 from storage at -80 °C. Rapidly thaw cells in 37 °C water bath.\nGently transfer cells to a 75 cm2 vented flask containing 10 ml cell culture media.\nIncubate flask in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Aspirate media after 24 hr and replace with fresh media. Grow cells until approximately 70 - 80% confluency.\n2. Counting and Plating Cells\nIn a 37 °C water bath, warm DMEM and 1x-trypsin-EDTA solution.\nAspirate media from cells and add 500 µl of trypsin. Incubate at 37°C for 2 - 5 min.\nUsing a scraper, remove cells from the flask and suspend in 5 ml of DMEM. Pass cells through a 70 µm strainer into a 50 ml tube three times.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and seed 8,000 cells/well in a black walled clear bottom plate in a final volume of 200 µl DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSN. Incubate plate in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 hr.\nRemove old DMEM and replace with 200 µl of warmed DMEM supplemented with 1% PSN to serum starve microglia. Incubate plate in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 hr.\n3. Activating Microglia\nIn separate tubes, dilute AgNPs (0.01, 0.05 or 0.1 µg/ml) and vehicle/neutral control (sodium citrate, 0.04 mM) in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 1% PSN to final working concentrations.\nRemove 100 µl of media from each well and replace with 100 µl of appropriate treatment compound.\nIncubate plate in 5 % CO2 at 37 °C for 24 hr.\n4. Filtering Conditioned Media",
    "Collect 200 µl of media supernatant from each well and transfer into a filter (molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa) with collection tube (1.5 to 2 ml capacity).\nCentrifuge at 14,000 x g at room temperature for 15 min.\nDiscard the flow-through (supernatant with particles) and place the filter upside-down into a new collection tube.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 x g at room temperature for 2 min.\n\tNOTE: The resulting filtered media (containing secreted cytokines) is concentrated by six-fold.\nBring the volume of the concentrate to 400 µl with fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSN and store on ice.\n\tNOTE: To ensure residual AgNPs are removed from filtered media, generate an AgNP concentration based on the characteristic peak at about 390 - 420 nm 10. Briefly, prepare aliquots of unfiltered AgNPs (0, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 µg/ml as described in step 3.1) and filtered vehicle control (sodium citrate, 0.04 mM) in serum-free DMEM. Aliquot 50 µl of filtered samples and standards into a black walled clear bottom plate. Using a spectrophotometer, measure absorbance at 390 - 410 nm and compare readings to the AgNP concentration curve. If filtered samples have the same absorbance value as the vehicle control sample, it can be assumed residual AgNPs are removed.\nUse half of the filtered media to determine TNF-α secretion following instructions from a commercially available kit.\n5. Hypothalamic Cell Culture Maintenance\nWarm DMEM cell culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSN to 37 °C.\nObtain frozen stock of hypothalamic (mHypo-A1/2) cells at passage 18 - 25 stored at 80 °C. Rapidly thaw cells in 37 °C water bath.\nGently transfer cells to a 75 cm2 vented flask containing 10 ml cell culture media.",
    "Incubate flask in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Aspirate media after 24 hr and replace with fresh media. Grow cells until approximately at 70 - 80% confluency.\n6. Determining Hypothalamic Cell Toxicity\nWarm DMEM and 1x-trypsin-EDTA solution in a 37 °C water bath.\nAspirate media from hypothalamic cells and add 500 µl of trypsin. Incubate at 37 °C for 2 - 5 min. Remove cells from flask using a scraper as described above in step 2.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and plate hypothalamic cells at 5,000 cells/well in a black walled clear bottom plate in a final volume of 200 µl DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PSN and incubate overnight in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nRemove 100 µl of old media using a multichannel pipetter and add 100 µl of filtered concentrated conditioned media, to a final concentration of 1x.\nIncubate plate in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 24 hr.\nAdd 22 µl of resazurin reagent and incubate plate for 20 min in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nUsing a multimode spectrophotometer, record fluorescence (560 nm EX/590 nm EM) to measure cell viability. Report results as relative fluorescence units (RFU).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
