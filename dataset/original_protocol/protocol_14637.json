    "The following protocol uses parameters defined by the experiments in Figures 4 and 6 regarding acquisition settings and experimental conditions. Many of these parameters can be modified to fit other experiments (i.e., exposure times, binning, fluorescent channels, etc.). All procedures must adhere to institutional guidelines and regulations and be approved by the institutional biosafety committee. Microscope manufacturer websites contain excellent information for live cell imaging.\n1. Microscopes and Imaging Software\nPerform live cell imaging on a wide variety of inverted microscopes. The most common microscopes are widefield epifluorescence and spinning-disc confocal. Here, use an automated and motorized widefield epifluorescence microscope with 200 watt metal halide light source.\nObtain a stage-top or microscope environmental chamber. Here, use a stage-top environmental chamber.\nUse commercial software to operate microscopes with utilities to execute time-lapse microscopy.\nUse commercially available software or ImageJ for image analysis. Many other analysis tools are available commercially, and there are custom-made programs many of which have been published8,18.\n2. Visualizing Cellular Processes and Phenotypic Responses\nVisualize cells with brightfield microscopy. Differential interference contrast and phase contrast alone can be very informative to study responses to anti-cancer drug responses. These processes can include mitosis, cell motility and apoptosis.\nVisualize cell structures, organelles and processes with fluorescent biosensors. Fluorescent probes are informative in tracking specific subcellular processes. These can include microtubule dynamics, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dynamics, protein accumulation and localization, and molecular signaling (e.g., phosphorylation, calcium).\n3. Preparation of Samples\nGrow cells in cell culture certified dishes in a standard, humidified cell culture incubator (e.g., 37 oC, 5% CO2, 80% relative humidity).\n\t\nGrow HT1080 cells in MEM with EBSS. Supplement the media with 10% v/v FBS, 1% v/v Pen/Strep, 1% v/v sodium pyruvate and 1% v/v non-essential amino acids.",
    "Two days prior to imaging, plate 50,000 HT1080 FUCCI cells into 3 wells of a 12-well #1.5 glass bottom dish in a certified sterile laminar-flow hood. Adjust the number of cells plated to achieve ~60% confluence for the start of the experiment. Depending on the cell line and nature of experiment the cell density may be less.\n\tNote: Cell density may have profound influence on the growth of the cell line and on the experimental results. Count cells to minimize experiment-to-experiment variability due to density.\n\t\nDepending on the environmental chamber and the necessary conditions for the experiment, plate cells in single well dishes (typically 35- or 60-mm), 4 well 35-mm dishes, 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culture plates, or coverslip slides in various formats. Use glass-bottom plates with #1.5 glass as most objective lenses are optimized for this thickness of glass, and imaging through cell culture plastic is very poor.\n\t\tNote: Some cell lines do not grow and survive on glass. In these cases, the glass can be coated in order to enhance cell adherence (e.g., poly-lysine or collagen). Some companies manufacture optical cell culture plastic, it must be determined empirically if this is a viable option.\n4. Environmental Chamber Set-up\nPrior to any experimentation, set-up the environmental chamber so that it operates at ~80% humidity and so the temperature at the sample position is 37 oC. Most cultured cells grow in 5% CO2/balance air atmosphere due to sodium bicarbonate buffer in the medium. Depending on the set-up, either set the environmental controller to 5% CO2 and it will mix 100% CO2 with air, or use pre-mixed, certified 5% CO2/balance air gas. Follow manufacturer directions for gas flow-rates.",
    "Note: Some cell lines grow in CO2-independent medium in which case they can be maintained without CO2. Specifically designed imaging media is also available that limits the addition of autofluorescent compounds. Growth in theses mediums for the desired cell type must be determined empirically beforehand.\nPrior to imaging, ensure the water reservoir is filled (following manufacturer's directions) with sterile distilled water. Turn on the environmental chamber to the desired temperature setting and place it into the microscope stage inset. To save gas, do not start the flow at this point.\n\tNote: If there is any free space between the stage-top chamber and stage inset and/or any tension on connection cords to the chamber it may introduce motion artifacts into the experiment.\n\t\nLay pieces of paraffin film over the edges of the stage inset opening prior to inserting the chamber into it to couple the chamber to the stage, and make sure that no connections are pulling on the chamber.\nAllow the chamber to equilibrate to 37 oC. Maintain a stable temperature to prevent temperature fluctuations during imaging which can affect cell physiology and introduce drift. Reaching temperature equilibration typically requires 30 min to 1 hr, depending on the environment.\n\t\nInsert a 'dummy' dish with water in the wells into the chamber while warming. An imaging dish filled with water mimics the sample, helping ensure the chamber is sufficiently warmed and stabilized. Filling the chamber with pre-warmed sterile water reduces the time required to temperature stabilization and minimizes the temperature decrease upon addition of the experimental sample.\n5. Microscope Set-up\nTurn on the microscope, associated computer, and any required peripherals.\n\t\nDepending on the light source, wait to turn it on until needed (e.g., LED).\nWith the objective turret in a low position, select the 20X 0.7 NA objective to be used.",
    "Position the sample over the objective - this will make it easier to find the cells when the sample is in the chamber.\nDefine imaging parameters at this time if they are known from previous experiments.\n6. Transporting Cells to Microscope and into the Chamber\nTransport the cells to be imaged from the incubator to the environmental chamber. Ensure that this is done quickly to limit the effects of a comparatively low CO2 atmosphere and decreased temperature on the cells. Follow all institutional biosafety guidelines for sample transport and clean-up in case of a spill.\n\t\nPlace the cells in a sealed Styrofoam container or insulated bag to avoid large environmental changes.\nInsert the sample imaging dish into the chamber following manufacturer's directions.\nAfter the cells have been secured within the environmental chamber, seal the chamber to maintain a stable environment and immediately turn on the source(s) of atmospheric gas.\n\t\nAs some environmental chambers do not utilize a tight, sealed lid, to retard evaporation, layer sterile, embryo-certified mineral oil on top of the growth medium. Wrap gas-permeant paraffin film around the perimeter-edges of the sample dish being careful not to obstruct the glass imaging area. Localized, secondary humidification methods can be employed. Condensation on the lid of the sample dish can diminish performance of brightfield microscopy.\nIn order to minimize the effects of thermal drift early during the experiment, wait 30 min before starting the time-lapse. The required time varies based on imaging dish size and other factors. Determine empirically.\n7. Setting up the Imaging\nSelect imaging conditions that will best represent the data. Take precautions to avoid phototoxicity by limiting exposure times, using lower intensity light and selecting probes that are excited by longer wavelengths of light.",
    "Define x, y and z-plane and desired wavelength(s) for each position to be imaged. The time resolution is limited by the number of positions and wavelengths. For long-term time-lapse of most cellular processes, acquire one image every 10 - 20 min; higher time resolution (short intervals, e.g.,1 min) provides more data points and therefore more robust cell tracking, but also results in more integrated light exposure and larger data sets.\n\t\nAs HT1080 FUCCI have dynamic green and red fluorescent proteins (see Representative Results), use the following exposure times: FITC/GFP - 50 msec, Texas Red/TRITC - 40 msec, Brightfield - 20 msec. Use a 2 x 2 bin.\nEnable software controlled autofocusing using the default parameters under advanced settings. Define an autofocus range of 10 µm with the recommended step size. Be sure to do this before starting the time-lapse. Autofocus with brightfield images and never with fluorescence to reduce phototoxicity and photobleaching.\n\t\nUse software controlled autofocusing systems on any microscope with a motorized stage, and directly focus on the sample. However, they can limit the acquisition speed of the experiment. Hardware controlled continuous focusing systems work well for time-lapse microscopy and improve speed, allowing for more positions to be imaged or a higher rate of acquisition. However, they rely on detection of the air-glass interface and may lose focus of the sample with variations in glass thickness across the well.\nReplace half of the media with media containing the desired drug concentration that has been warmed to 37 oC. Partial media replacement helps to reduce thermal drift. The conditions in this experiment are Vehicle (DMSO), 1 µM selinexor and 10 µM PD0332991.",
    "Note: This step can also be done after starting the acquisition by pausing and restarting the experiment. This allows for longitudinal tracking of pre- and post-drug responses of single cells. If drug stability or metabolism is a concern, pausing and replacing the media can be done with the same method. To test for drug degradation or metabolism, media from treated cells can also be placed on naïve cells to test drug action.\nStart the time-lapse.\nAs the time-lapse runs, ensure that the imaged fields remain in focus and the chamber maintains a humid 37 oC.\n\t\nAdjust focus as needed by pausing the acquisition during the time gap between time points.\nIf necessary, add water to the chamber during longer experiments. Avoid cooling the chamber by adding pre-warmed, sterile distilled water at 37 oC.\n8. Ending the Time-lapse\nWhen the experiment has run to completion, stop the acquisition if it was not set to stop automatically.\nEnsure that the time-lapse has been saved properly onto the hard drive, although most software packages automatically save during the acquisition if not finished properly data can be lost.\nRemove the chamber from the microscope and dispose of the cells into biohazardous waste following approved institutional biosafety procedures.\n9. Longitudinal Tracking and Analysis of Time-lapse Data\nChoose the methodology for analysis that is appropriate for the biological processes of interest. Many plugins for ImageJ, programs using MatLab, and custom platforms have been produced for specific applications. The following methodology covers tracking of nuclei and analysis of nuclear fluorescent probes as demonstrated in Figures 4 and 5.\nOpen the .tif image stacks for the utilized channels in ImageJ. Alternatively, open native files from the acquisition program directly in ImageJ using the Bioformats plugin.",
    "Draw a region of interest (ROI) within the nucleus of one cell using the brightfield image or the nuclear label channel (if used) and add it to the ROI manager. Note: If the imaged cells have a nuclear label (e.g., histone H2B-EGFP), then automatic cell tracking may be utilized to create regions of interest (ROIs) representing individual nuclei through time.\nProceed to the next time point and position the ROI within the same nucleus. Add the ROI to the ROI manager.\nContinue to track and make ROIs for the individual cell until there is a cellular event (mitosis, apoptosis, etc.) or the cell can no longer be tracked (i.e., moves out of frame or the experiment ends).\nWhen ROIs have been established for cells through the time they are in the field, superimpose them onto the fluorescent channels of interest. Measure the mean intensity of the fluorescence in each channel for every time point. Save the ROI list for later use.\n\t\nVarious measurements can be made within the ROI for applications in different experiments. Click Analysis → Set Measurements… to bring up a menu to choose the analytical method (e.g., mean intensity within the ROI, integrated intensity, etc.).\nNote cell fates for individual cells (e.g., apoptosis, division, survival) while tracking. This allows for creation of survival curves and further population analysis.\nWith the mean intensity for both channels, create a scatter plot to display cell cycle dynamics in response to therapeutics (Figure 5B, C).",
    "Note: Plots can be created for individual cells over time or averaged over a population of tracked cells. Quantitative imaging can be critical for establishing complex responses and cell relationships in response to cancer therapeutics. Long-term time-lapse microscopy, longitudinal tracking and data analysis is a multi-step process, with many options for the type of microscopy and analysis tools, and follows the general outline provided in Figure 1.\nSubscription Required.
