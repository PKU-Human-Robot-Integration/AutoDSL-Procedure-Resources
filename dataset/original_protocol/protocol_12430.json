    "NOTE: Open field activity monitoring system uses an open field Plexiglas chamber with photocell emitters and receptors equally spaced along the perimeter of the chamber (Figure 1). These photocell emitters and receptors create an x-y grid of invisible infrared beams. When an animal is placed in the chamber, it moves about, causing beam breaks. Vertical sensors are also present to assess vertical activity levels (i.e. rearing behavior) as well. The analyzer records the beam break information and rapidly analyzes it. The computer software then calculates multiple activity measures over the preset time period. These measures include: horizontal activity (units), vertical activity (units), total distance traveled (cm), movement time (sec), and rest time (sec)5.\nNOTE: In general the testing room should be temperature- and humidity-controlled, with even illumination. Testing chambers should be evenly distributed about the room and should not be placed in direct light, dark corners, or shadowed areas. All instrument acclimation and testing should be performed at the same time each day (e.g., in the morning) and by the same individuals. These individuals should be blinded to the animal treatment group, and genotype when possible.\nThe following protocol has been performed under the guidance and approval of the Children’s National Medical Center IACUC.\n1. Instrument Acclimation\nPlace the mice in the testing room in their home cages for approximately 10 min to acclimate. Leave the room during the acclimation period.\nReturn to the testing room and turn on the activity chambers. Even though data are not being collected at this time, this will further mimic the testing environment.\nGently remove each mouse from their home cage and immediately place them in the test chambers. If the activity chamber contains a center divider that divides the chamber into quadrants (Figure 1), place one mouse into each empty quadrant.",
    "Once all animals are loaded into the test chambers, place the lid on top of each test chamber. Leave the room during this acclimation time.\nFollowing the 60 min, return to the room. Remove the lid from each test chamber and gently return each mouse to his or her respective home cage.\nClean each chamber with disinfectant and paper towels. Ensure no dirt particles are left in the chamber.\n\tNOTE: If multiple sessions are being run each day, thoroughly clean each test chamber in between each session.\nRepeat Steps 1-6 for 4 consecutive days.\n\tNOTE: Perform acclimation one week prior to initial data collection. If animals are tested multiple times throughout a study, only perform acclimation prior to the first round of testing to avoid habituation. In addition, randomly assign the animals to a new box each session. Track the box assignments throughout the duration of the study.\n2. Data Collection\nPlace mice in the testing room in their home cages for 10-30 min to acclimate. Leave the room during this time.\nFollowing the 10-30 min, return to the testing room. Turn on the activity chambers and open the accompanying computer software on the computer connected to the chambers. If the chamber contains a quadrant divider, insert the partition at this time.\n\tNOTE: If the test chamber contains a quadrant divider, two animals can be placed in the test chamber during data collection. One animal can be placed in the front-left quadrant and one in the back-right quadrant (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Do not place animals in all four quadrants during data collection or in the same row or column. Placing the animals in these orientations will interfere with the x-y grid of infrared beams and the animal movement will be inaccurately measured.",
    "Configure the computer software to perform a prebeam check. This configuration will allow one to run a pre-beam check following the experimental setup and prior to the insertion of animals into the test chambers (see below).\n\tNOTE: When the prebeam check is run, the computer software assesses the function of the x-y infrared beams. For example, it can determine if the photocell emitters and receptors are blocked and unable to appropriately detect movement within the chamber.\nSet the primary data collection parameters in the computer software to collect six 10 min blocks of data (i.e. collect data for a total of 60 min), and then enter the appropriate date, filename, and Mouse ID numbers.\nOnce all parameters are set, run the prebeam check. If a chamber does not pass the prebeam check it is most likely due to poor alignment of the center quadrant divider or test chamber. If this happens, realign the center quadrant divider and test chamber until the sensors are no longer blocked and the system states that the test chamber is ready. If this does not correct the problem, reference the instrument manual.\nWhen all test chambers are ready, gently remove the mouse from his or her home cage and immediately place him or her into the test chamber. Note the ID of the mouse and make sure it matches the one entered into computer.\nOnce all animals are appropriately loaded into the test chambers, place the lid on top of each chamber. Then select the appropriate command in the computer software to start data collection. At this time, the analyzer and computer software will start recording activity levels according to the data collection parameters.\nLeave the testing room for the remainder of the testing period.",
    "Upon completion of the testing period (i.e. 60 min later), immediately return to the testing room. Save the data, and then return each animal to their respective home cage.\nClean all units with a disinfectant and paper towels.\n\tNOTE: If multiple sessions are being run each day, thoroughly clean each test chamber in between each session.\nExport data to a spreadsheet and then exit the software program.\nCheck the data to ensure they were recorded. If the data were not recorded, or the animals slept throughout the entirety of the data collection time period, perform an extra day of data collection.\n\tNOTE: An animal is considered to be “sleeping” if it does not move throughout the entire 60 min testing duration.\nRepeat Steps 2.1-2.12 for 4 consecutive days.\n\tNOTE: If animals are tested at multiple time points throughout the duration of a study, do not perform open field activity measurements more than once a month to avoid habituation. In addition, randomly assign the animals to a new box each session. Track the box assignments throughout the duration of the study.\n3. Data Analysis\nCalculate the mean horizontal activity (units), vertical activity (units), total distance traveled (cm), movement time (sec), and rest time (sec) per mouse and group. The computer software calculates and reports the total horizontal activity (units), vertical activity (units), total distance traveled (cm), movement time (sec), and rest time (sec) over the data collection period (i.e. 60 min) for each mouse. Calculate the mean for each of the aforementioned parameters from the 4 days of data collection.\nPrior to performing any statistical analyses, assess the normality of the data using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and check for outliers using the Grubb’s test. Remove any significant outliers (p <0.05).",
    "For normally distributed data, compare means between groups using either an independent sample t-test or a one way ANOVA and post-hoc test with p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons depending on the total number of treatment groups.\nFor non-normally distributed data, compare median values between groups using either the Wilcoxon rank sum test, or a Kruskal-Wallis test and rank sum test with resulting p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons depending on the total number of treatment groups."
