    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of biotin-conjugated primary antibody\nTiming: 1–2 h\nHere we describe how to conjugate primary antibody using the Biotin labeling kit-NH2, but biotinylation using other products (e.g., Biotin Protein Labeling Kit (Roche), Biotin-XX Microscale Protein Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes), Biotinylation Kit/Biotin Conjugation Kit (Fast, Type A) - Lightning-Link® (abcam)) is also acceptable.\nAlternatives: If you are using an already biotinylated primary antibody, these processes are unnecessary.\nAlternatives: If you use HRP-conjugated secondary antibody as a detection antibody (such as the one in PS Capture Exosome ELISA Kit (Anti Mouse IgG POD), these processes are unnecessary.\nAdd 100 μL WS Buffer and antibody containing 50–200 μg protein to a Filtration Tube. Pipettes to mix and centrifuge at 8,000 × g for 10 min.\nAdd 10 μL DMSO to NH2-Reactive Biotin, and dissolve with pipetting. Proceed to the next step immediately.\nAdd 100 μL reaction buffer to the filtration tube, followed by 8 μL of NH2-Reactive Biotin solution, and mix with pipets.\nIncubate the tube at 37°C for 10 min.\nWash the filtration tube three times with WS buffer.\nAdd 100 μL WS buffer to the filtration tube, and centrifuge for 10 min at 8,000 × g. Discard the filtrate. After centrifugation, if the solution is still on the membrane, spin at 8,000 × g for an additional 5 min.\nAdd 200 μL WS buffer to the filtration tube and centrifuge it at 8,000 × g for 10 min. Discard the filtrate. Repeat this step (b) one more time.\nTo recover the conjugate, pipette around 10 times with 200 μL of WS buffer added to the filter tube. Transfer the solution to a microtube.\nPreparation of Washing Buffer\nTiming: 5 min",
    "Critical: When using PS Capture Exosome ELISA Kit (Tim4-coated plate), addition of Exosome Binding Enhancer to Washing Buffer is essential for extracellular vesicles to bind with a plate.\nBring Washing Buffer (10×) to room temperature before opening and dispense the necessary amount.\n[PS Capture Exosome ELISA Kit] Dilute 10 times with purified water. Exosome Binding Enhancer (100×) should be added to the diluted solution and thoroughly mixed.\nNote: As components have a tendency to deposit, use Washing Buffer (1×) no later than 8 h after the addition of Exosome Binding Enhancer (100×).\n[CD9 Capture Exosome ELISA Kit] Dilute 10 times with purified water.\nPreparation of Tim-4 or CD9 plate\nTiming: 10 min\nWash each well of a 96-well plate 3 times with 300–350 μL of Washing Buffer (1×). The plate should be inverted and carefully blotted with clean paper towels.\nReaction of ELISA plate with diluted urine samples\nTiming: 2 h ∼\nFill each well with 100 μL of sample dilution, standard dilution, and Reaction Buffer as a blank (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Put a plate seal over the plate. Incubate for 2 h at 20°C–25°C room temperature.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2818-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. An example of how to arrange urine samples in ELISA plate\nColumns 1 and 2 contain dilution standards for CD9 or CD63 antibodies, and column 3 contains standards for the primary antibody to be examined. Reaction Buffer (RB) instead of urine is placed for background measurements. Columns 4 and 5 contain the actual samples to be assayed, including negative control without primary antibody (A-4). Control with the antibody absorbed with antigens can be placed to confirm specificity (B-4) (See also Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).",
    "Note: It is advised to shake the microplate during incubation at a speed of 300–500 rpm because the standing condition could result in low detection sensitivity and significant well-to-well variance. Overnight incubation may be necessary depending on the reactivity of the primary antibodies.\nDispose of the solution and wash three times with 300–350 μL of Washing Buffer (1×). The plate should be turned over and carefully blotted with clean paper towels.\nAntibody labeling\nTiming: 1h ∼\nFill each well with 100 μL of biotinylated antibody diluent. As a negative control, add 100 μL of Reaction Buffer to a well instead of antibody diluent. Cover with a plate seal.\nIncubate for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) with shaking at 300–500 rpm using a microplate shaker.\nNote: The dilution and appropriate incubation time vary greatly depending on the primary antibody. If appropriate sensitivity is not obtained, increase concentration, or extend the incubation time. Overnight incubation may be applicable.\nRepeat the wash as in step 5.\nColorimetric assay\nTiming: 3 h\nAdd 100 μL of HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (1×) to each well. Put a plate seal over it.\nAlternatives: If you use HRP-conjugated secondary antibody as a detection antibody (such as the one in PS Capture Exosome ELISA Kit (Anti Mouse IgG POD)), dispense 100 μL of the secondary detection antibody reaction solution in each well.\nIncubate for 2 h at room temperature (20°C–25°C) with shaking at 300–500 rpm using a microplate shaker.\nNote: We usually proceed immediately to the next step, but overnight incubation may be applicable.\nAlternatives: If you use HRP-conjugated secondary antibody as a detection antibody, incubate for 1 h.\nDiscard the solution in the well and wash 5 times with 300–350 μL of Washing Buffer (1×). The plate should be turned over and carefully blotted with fresh paper towels.",
    "Pour each well with 100 μL of TMB Solution that has been warmed to room temperature. Use a microplate shaker to stir for approximately 1 min. Put a new plate seal on top.\nIncubate for 30 min at 20°C–25°C room temperature.\nPour each well with 100 μL of Stop Solution that has been warmed to room temperature.\nUsing a microplate shaker, stir for approximately 5 s. Measure the absorbance immediately using a microplate reader with wavelengths of 450 nm and 620 nm (600–650 nm).\nNote: Deposits may be seen on a plate's surface."
