    "NOTE: the use of rat balloon injury model and associated procedures including injection of recombinant sRAGE and ultrasound sonographic studies have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of National Institute on Aging, NIH.\n1. Pre-surgery Preparations\nInstrument, Surgical Platform, and Personal Protection Equipment.\n\t\nSee Materials and Equipment's Table for all the surgical instruments and reagents used in this procedure. Autoclave all surgical instruments prior to surgical procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: For multiple surgeries performed at the same day, use a pre-heated glass bead sterilizer to sterilize the instruments between surgeries.\nSterilize the surface of operating platform with 70% alcohol. Put on surgical gown, hair cover, surgical mask, safety glasses, and gloves. Leave a box of sterilized gloves near the surgical platform for additional use.\nPreparation of the Balloon Catheter.\n\t\nFill 1 ml syringe with sterile water and attach the syringe to a sterile water-filled two-way stopcock. Gently push the water through the stopcock to fill the Luer-lock portion of the balloon catheter, and remove air bubbles from the opening of the catheter.\nTest balloon inflation to assure the balloon can be inflated by 0.02 ml of water. Store the tip of the balloon in a container of sterilized water before the surgery to avoid desiccation and contamination.\nAnesthesia and Animal Preparation.\n\t\nWeigh male Wistar rats (400-450 g) and check the ear tag to confirm the ID. Place the rat in an induction chamber, then turn on the vaporizer and adjust the isoflurane level to 3.5-4.0% and the oxygen level to 1.5-2.0 L. Check the depth of sedation by checking pedal withdrawal reflex such as pinching the toe or tail of the animal.",
    "After reaching the anesthesia (i.e. the animal lacks pedal withdrawal reflex), transfer the animal to the surgical platform and hook the rat with a nose cone that connects to an anesthesia vaporizer. Adjust isoflurane concentration to 1.5-2.0 and oxygen to 0.6-1.0 L. Periodically check the depth of sedation by pinching the toe or tail of the animal to assure that the rat is completely relaxed and immobile.\nAfter reaching the surgical level of anesthesia, shave the ventral neck region from the chin down to just above the sternum with animal hair clippers and swab the shaved skin with alternating 1:10 dilution of povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol 3 times.\nPlace ophthalmic solution on the open eyes of the animal with a cotton swab to prevent them from drying. Moisten the tongue and mouth of the animal with drinking water to avoid drying during the operation.\nCover the rat with a sterile surgical sheet and cut the sheet to expose the neck region. Place the animal in supine position on a heated pad on the surgical platform with the head toward the surgeon. Fix the limbs of the animal to the surgical platform using tape.\n2. Surgical Procedures\nDissection and Isolation of the Left Carotid Artery\n\t\nUse a scalpel to make a straight incision below the chin in a direction toward the tail all the way to the top of the sternum just above the rib cage. Use a 7S forceps to bluntly dissect the salivary glandular tissues under the skin to expose the muscular layer. Separate muscular tissues to gain access to carotid vasculature and the vagus nerve in the neck region.",
    "Bluntly dissect tissues surrounding the carotid artery, and carefully separate the vagus nerve and vascular fascia to avoid any damage. Continually dissect till the carotid artery bifurcation to expose the internal and external branches and the common carotid artery down to the sternum.\nPreparation of Arteriotomy\n\t\nFor retraction and hemostasis, place a ligature at the most proximal site on the left common carotid artery, and another ligature at the location immediate distal to the bifurcation.\nPlace a 4.0 silk suture at the external carotid artery as far from the bifurcation as possible to retract the artery toward the head. Permanently ligate small arteries using 4.0 silk sutures along the external carotid artery including the ascending pharyngeal, the occipital and the superior thyroid to avoid arterial leak.\nPlace a 4.0 silk suture around the internal carotid artery to avoid a significant retrograde blood loss. Usually, the available length of the internal branch is minimal. To visualize the internal carotid artery, expose the internal carotid artery as much as possible by gently retracting the overlying carotid artery to the right.\nIntroduction of the Balloon Catheter\n\t\nRetract the proximal suture on the common carotid artery and place an arterial clamp on the vessel to temporarily stop the blood flow. Make a small (1/3 to 1/4 of the circumference of the artery) incision on the external carotid artery at a location as distal to the suture as possible.\nGently insert an un-inflated balloon catheter into the incision and then advance the catheter in the lumen close to the arterial clamp on the common carotid artery. Remove the clamp, and further advance the balloon catheter to the aortic arch, approximately 35-40 mm from the incision.\nBalloon Injury",
    "Manually inflate the catheter to a volume of 0.02 ml via the attached syringe and then lock the stopcock between the syringe and the catheter. Slowly withdraw the catheter with rotations. When the catheter is close to the arteriotomic incision, deflate the balloon. Advance the catheter back to original location.\nRepeat 2.4.1 for a total 3 times. Carefully remove the catheter from the artery lumen.\nClose Up the Surgical Wound\n\t\nClose the arteriotomy with sutures. Release the internal carotid artery to restore the blood flow. Check for arterial bleeding or leak. If bleeding occurs, apply a piece of gauze with a bit pressure to stop the bleeding.\nRemove the rest of sutures and clamps used for the procedure. Close the glandular tissue with 6.0 sutures. Close the skin with skin sutures or wound clips. Turn off isoflurane and leave the animal with pure oxygen for a few min.\n3. Administration of Therapeutics, Analgesics, Post-surgery Care, and Euthanasia\nAdministration of Therapeutics and Analgesics.\n\t\nFollowing the surgery, inject buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) intramuscularly. Inject 5 ml pre-warmed sterile saline subcutaneously to compensate the blood loss during the surgery. Inject sRAGE (0.5 ng/g) (therapeutics) into the peritoneum.\nMoisten the eyes again with ophthalmic ointment. Place the rat on the heat pad and monitor the animal until it regains complete consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nReturn the rat to a cage with clean bedding and bring the cage back to the vivarium. Place a special observation card on the cage to alert the attending veterinarians and caretakers.\nPost-surgery Cleanup\n\t\nPut used surgical material including pads, swabs, needles et al either into the trash or a special disposal container. Disinfect the surgery platform and clean the surgical instruments.\nPost-surgery Care",
    "Administer buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) twice a day (b.i.d.) during the 48 hr post-surgery period. Monitor the animal closely during the 48 hr post-surgery period for the common signs of distress such as immobility, inability to feed, hutched posture, ruffled fur, and grimace. Monitor wound conditions for redness, swelling, dehiscence, and infections.\n\t\tNOTE: Additional treatments may be prescribed according to attending veterinarian's recommendation.\nRemove the suture or wound clips according to attending veterinarian's recommendation.\nEuthanasia\n\t\nTwo weeks after the surgery, euthanize the rats to isolate the carotid arteries for post-mortem histo-morphological analyses22. Place the rat in a chamber containing 5-20% isoflurane saturated air for at least 2 min till complete cessation of respiration. Verify the death prior to dissection of the organs and tissues.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
