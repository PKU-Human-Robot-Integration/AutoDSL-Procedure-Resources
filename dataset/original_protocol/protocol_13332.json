    "1. Printing and preparation of a titanium alloy workpiece\nPrepare a workpiece made of porous titanium alloy using the SLM printing technique. Import STL format files into the metal printer, add Ti-6Al-4V powder, install the build substrate, set up the wiper blade, set the laser spot size to 70 µm, and set the layer thickness to 30 µm (Figure 1).\nGrade 23 Ti-6Al-4V powder with chemical composition as shown in Table 1 and a powder particle size of 15-53 µm.\nDesign the porous titanium alloy structure with simulated trabecular bone based on Tyson polygon anisotropy using parametric modeling, with an aperture size of 400-600 µm, small beam diameter of 100-300 µm, and porosity of 70%31 .\nEnsure the porous titanium alloy workpiece is in the shape of the medical lumbar cage32. For the porous structure and the lumbar cage, use Boolean operations to obtain the porous workpiece structure.\n2. Heat treatment\nA high temperature gradient during SLM printing will cause residual stress in the workpiece. Use heat treatment to eliminate the residual stress inside the workpiece and maintain the toughness, plasticity, tensile strength, and other physical properties of the workpiece.\nSeparate the porous titanium alloy workpiece from the printing substrate after printing using a medium speed wire-cutting machine. Install the titanium plate on the medium speed wire-cutting machine, in order to make the plate perpendicular to the ground, and ensure that the wire just contacts the support surface. Then, cut along the support and titanium plate to separate the porous titanium alloy workpiece from the printing substrate.",
    "Place the porous titanium alloy workpiece into the ultrasonic cleaning machine with deionized water for 15 min and the temperature controlled at 30 °C. Keep the ultrasonic frequency at 40,000 Hz. The ultrasonic cleaning aims to remove the titanium alloy powder remaining in the porous structure.\nRepeat the aforementioned ultrasonic cleaning procedure four times to remove residual titanium alloy powder and deionized water from the porous structure. After that, aim high-pressure air at the porous structure for 20 s to blow away the residual powder and liquid. The pressure of the high-pressure air is 0.71 MPa, which is generated by an air compressor and air dryer.\nPut the titanium basket into the heat treatment furnace at room temperature. The titanium basket is equipped with titanium alloy workpieces separated from the substrate. Keep different workpieces from touching each other and close the furnace door.\nOpen the gas valve, take out the air, and keep the vacuum degree at 3.9 x 10-3 Pa.\nSet the heat treatment process. First, heat the furnace to 800 °C for 1.5 h, maintain the temperature for 2 h, and then cool the workpiece inside the furnace. This process ensures that the vacuum pressure remains unchanged.\nAfter the heat treatment, cool the furnace to room temperature and fill the furnace with air. After returning to atmospheric pressure, as seen on the panel, take out the porous titanium alloy workpiece.\n3. Removing the support\nAfter heat treatment, the porous titanium alloy workpieces have no internal residual stress, so the workpiece surface will not crack and/or fracture when removing the support.\nMeasure the support thickness using a vernier caliper, fix the workpiece on the low-speed wire-cutting electrical discharge machining (EDM) machine, and ensure that the copper wire just contacts the support surface.",
    "Set the cutting depth equal to the support thickness. It's inevitable that removing the support by the wire-cutting EDM machine will form an ablation oxide layer. When removing the support, ensure that the workpiece is immersed in deionized water to minimize burns to the workpiece surface.\nA reasonable support design ensures accuracy when removing the support. If there are still some support residues, polish the workpiece with sandpaper.\n4. Ultrasonic cleaning\nSince the workpiece is immersed in deionized water during support removal, perform ultrasonic cleaning before plasma polishing to remove other impurities.\nPut the porous titanium alloy workpiece into the ultrasonic cleaning machine with deionized water, set the water temperature to 30 °C, and clean it for 5 min. After 5 min, take out the workpiece and blow out residual liquid with high-pressure air.\n5. First characterization\nScanning electron microscope (SEM): Image the surfaces with a SEM at 15 and 20 kV accelerating voltage, after ultrasonic cleaning and before plasma polishing.\nTake images at 30x, 100x, and 500x visual fields. Observe the general surface morphology, particle adhesion, and pore size of the porous titanium alloy workpiece, and qualitatively evaluate the plasma polishing effect.\nConfocal microscope: Image the surfaces using a confocal microscope.\nPlace the workpiece on the storage platform horizontally. Measure the surface arithmetic average roughness (Ra) parameter. Use ZEN core v3.0 and ConfoMap ST 8.0 software.\n\t\nSelect 2.5x magnification, choose Wide for live mode, click Auto intensity, and then go to 5x magnification to observe the overall situation. Click Auto intensity and set the live mode to Comp. Select the area of interest, click Set first at the lowest point and Set last at the highest point, and then set the acquisition to Normal.",
    "After about 5 min, import the results into a new document in ConfoMap ST 8.0. The Ra is easy to obtain in the parameters table in ConfoMap ST.\nObserve the overall condition of the workpiece with a fivefold mirror, then switch to a high-power mirror and focus the field of vision on a trabecula. Evaluate the plasma polishing effect quantitatively by describing the Ra of the porous titanium alloy workpiece before plasma polishing.\n6. Plasma polishing\nFor this, use an electrolytic cell to immerse the workpiece in an electrolyte connected as an anode20. Use 4% ammonium sulfate solution [(NH4)2SO4], pH between 5.7-6.1, as the electrolyte. Preheat the polishing electrolyte to 80 °C before plasma polishing.\nSet the polishing current to 59 A, the voltage to 313 V, and the polishing electrolyte temperature to 101.6 °C (Figure 2A). Conduct plasma polishing according to these parameters.\nPlace the surface of the porous titanium alloy workpiece to be polished horizontally and fix it on the fixture, and then put the fixture into the plasma polishing machine (Figure 2B). Conduct plasma polishing for 90 s, and then take the fixture out of the plasma polishing machine.\nSince the porous titanium alloy workpiece is fixed on the fixture through the clamping point, the clamping point is not in contact with the polishing solution, and the corresponding electrochemical reaction does not occur at the clamping point. Therefore, change the position of the clamping point slightly after the fixture is taken out.\nConduct plasma polishing again for 90 s and take the fixture out of the plasma polishing machine. Remove the porous titanium alloy workpiece from the fixture and then put it into the ultrasonic cleaning machine with deionized water.",
    "Set the water temperature at 30 °C and clean the workpiece for 2 min. After 2 min, take out the workpiece and blow out the residual liquid with high-pressure air.\n7. Second characterization\nAfter the completion of plasma polishing, image the surfaces using a SEM and a confocal microscope in the same way as in step 5. Assess the influence of plasma polishing on the surface roughness and surface quality of 3D printing porous titanium alloy by comparing the above two shooting results.\nSubscription Required.
