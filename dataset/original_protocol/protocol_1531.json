    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nStrategy 1: Exploiting the difference in light-scattering properties between red blood cells and leukocytes\nTiming: 35 min\nLight scattering is commonly used to discriminate subpopulations of leukocytes by flow cytometry. By exploiting the differential scattering of red and white blood cells and simultaneously detecting side light scatter at 405 and 488 nm, it is possible to differentiate erythrocytes and leukocytes in diluted whole blood. This method is based in the differential light absorbance properties of oxyhemoglobin, with a maximum at 413.1 nm. As red blood cells exhibit a differential absorption of light at 405 nm and 488 nm, the dual scatter plot allows resolution of independent clusters of erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAt 488 nm, the side light scatter of RBCs clearly dominates the whole scatter plot, making the discrimination of leukocytes impossible. At 405 nm, there is an apparent shrinkage of the erythrocyte cluster based on the differential light absorption of hemoglobin at this wavelength (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Hence, the simultaneous detection of side light scatter at 405 and 488 nm the dual scatter plot allows discrimination of RBCs from leukocytes, avoiding the disadvantages of hemolysis, such as incomplete depletion of red blood cells, and potential damage and loss of leukocytes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1100-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Effect of red cell lysing reagents on cell loss and subsets\nRepresentative forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) density plots comparing the protocol used for minimal sample perturbation in (A) and the effect of lysing reagents in (B), showing alterations in the scatter measurements. Cell counts provided 1782.04 events/μL when using unlysed human peripheral blood (A) and 1049.08 events/μL after a 10 min ammonium chloride lysis protocol (B).",
    "Keep in mind the need to plan carefully for the number of cells needed when analyzing a whole blood sample for rare cells, to ensure that a statistically acceptable number of cells can be analyzed from a diluted unlysed blood sample. Determining this number can start with a simple calculation based on the relative or absolute number of target cells (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Using this strategy, lower sample input rates up to 200 μL/min will minimize scatter degradation. Intact erythrocytes outnumber leukocytes up to three orders of magnitude. Expected counts after acquiring 15 μL of the above prepared dilution will approximately provide the following cell distribution: 100,000 to 150,000 erythrocytes, 1,000 to 1,500 platelets and 150 to 250 leukocytes. Even with this small number of leukocytes, scattered light will help to easily discern populations of lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. Indicative percentage of erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes using peripheral blood obtained from healthy donors (n=10) gave 94.54%–92.13% of erythrocytes, 7.66%–529% of platelets, and 0.30%–0.13% of leukocytes.\nFlow cytometer set-up\nTiming: 15 min\nNote: The flow cytometer used in this study was the Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher) (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Setting up a flow cytometer to detect violet side scatter (VSSC) is easy and requires changing of the optical configuration by physically moving the 405 and the 450 nm filters within the instrument. Please refer to the information supplied by the flow cytometer manufacturer and follow the specific section explaining the procedure you should follow to set up VSSC detection.",
    "Critical: A fixed optical assembly will not allow physically changing bandpass and dichroic filters. Fixed optical architectures without a VSSC channel will not allow VSSC detection even if your cytometer is equipped with a violet laser. If no alternative is possible for violet side scatter collection, the difference in fluorescence properties between leukocytes and erythrocytes can be exploited.\nCreate a new experiment.\nSelect the parameters for measurements. Select pulse height for FSC, BSSC, and VSSC (Blue and Violet Side Scatter, respectively). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nSelect the parameters and an appropriate threshold or thresholds for event triggering. Threshold is selected low enough to capture all events of interests and to eliminate almost all noise and debris. Indicative thresholds on the Attune NxT will be around 1 to 3 × 1000 setting. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Although FSC is the most common threshold parameter for immunophenotyping, SSC and in particular VSSC will provide low background relative to signal, as the lower wavelength allows for better particle discrimination according to Mie theory (Bohren and Huffman, 1983[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). As shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], noise for the VSSC is lower when compared with BSSC. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows the reduced contribution of RBCs that are coincident with leukocytes, being minimized when the VSSC is used.\nDesign the experiment workspace with the following density/dot plots as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1100-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Gating strategy according to the target population of erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes",
    "For the study of erythrocytes, gate the 488 nm BSSC-H vs. 405 nm VSSC and logarithmic display excluding platelets, leukocytes and noise. For the study of platelets, gate the 488 nm BSSC-H vs. 405 nm VSSC and logarithmic display including leukocytes and excluding erythrocytes. Use this gate to create a platelet differential scatterplot now excluding leukocytes. For the study of leukocytes, gate the 488 nm BSSC-H vs. 405 nm VSSC and logarithmic display including platelets and excluding erythrocytes. Use this gate to create a leukocyte differential scatterplot now excluding platelets.\nUse a dual wavelength scatterplot as a reference method to adjust the parameter settings and the appropriate threshold for triggering: 488 nm BSSC-H vs. 405 nm VSSC-H with logarithmic display.\nUse a 488 nm BSSC-H vs. FSC-H plot with logarithmic display identify platelets, erythrocytes and leukocytes. Also use a 405 nm VSSC-H vs. FSC-H density/dot plot.\nUse a FSC-H vs. a 488 nm BSSC-H plot with linear display (WBC differential scatter plot) to identify leukocytes. Also use a FSC-H vs. a 405 nm VSSC-H plot with linear display, to better visualize the cell populations, especially when high leukocyte rates are needed.\nSample preparation\nTiming: 5 min\nCollect freshly drawn human blood anti-coagulated with EDTA, ACD or heparin. In our laboratory we commonly use K3EDTA tubes validated for routine hematological testing. Please keep in mind that not all anticoagulants are recommended for use in immunophenotyping or functional analysis. Process the samples and collect the data preferably as soon as possible after collection.",
    "Critical: In order to preserve cell function and cell viability, fresh whole blood should be analyzed immediately after collection, when possible. Alternatively analyze samples within two hours of collection. If blood samples cannot be processed within two hours, samples should be kept at room temperature (20°C–24°C) for up to 24 h. Using this strategy, lower sample input rates up to 200 μL/min will minimize scatter degradation. Intact erythrocytes outnumber leukocytes up to three orders of magnitude. Expected counts after acquiring 15 μL of the above prepared dilution will approximately provide the following cell distribution: 100,000 to 150,000 erythrocytes, 1,000 to 1,500 platelets and 150 to 250 leukocytes. Even with this small number of leukocytes, scattered light will help to easily discern populations of lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes.\nPrepare a highly diluted sample of blood to determine the number of leukocytes. Dilute blood 1:500 by mixing 2 μL of freshly collected whole blood in 998 μL of HBSS using a 1.5 mL tube or a 12 × 75 mm polypropylene tube. Minimum number of cells required for analysis should be planned accordingly Poisson statistics.\nDo not vortex. Carefully homogenize the cell suspension using a P1000 pipette. Wide-bore tips can be alternatively used for marrow processing.\nSample acquisition\nTiming: 10 min\nRun the sample at a low flow rate using a 488 nm BSSC-H vs. 405 nm VSSC-H plot in logarithmic scale and adjust both parameters.\nSet threshold empirically for event triggering according to the population of interest. Threshold must be selected low enough to capture all events of interests as well as to eliminate almost all noise and debris.",
    "Acquire the sample and collect the number of cells needed for analysis, using the gating strategy detailed below. Plan for event rates well below the Poisson 10% coincident rate of an instrument, where 90% of cells can be classified as singlets.\nNote: Dual side scatter enables a rapid WBCs quantification of very small sample volume in highly diluted suspensions (1:500) when using VSSC thresholding. Lower volumetric throughput cytometers may need to reduce the theoretical dilution factors to achieve acceptable run times during acquisition.\nGating strategy\nTiming: 5 min\nApply the following gating strategy according to the target population as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]:\nFor the study of erythrocytes, gate the 488 nm BSSC-H vs. 405 nm VSSC and logarithmic display excluding platelets, leukocytes and noise.\nFor the study of platelets, gate the 488 nm BSSC-H vs. 405 nm VSSC and logarithmic display including leukocytes and excluding erythrocytes. Use this gate to create a platelet differential scatterplot now excluding leukocytes.\nFor the study of leukocytes, gate the 488 nm BSSC-H vs. 405 nm VSSC and logarithmic display including platelets and excluding erythrocytes. Use this gate to create a leukocyte differential scatterplot now excluding platelets.\nNote: The differentiation of leukocytes and erythrocytes can be easily validated using fluorescent conjugates either to target specific antigen expressing cells or to combine with viable DNA stains. Moreover, the use of a fluorescent threshold will capture only fluorescent-labeled cells, and will dramatically increase throughput, even to identify rare cells. We have routinely used this method for CD34+ cell determination by flow cytometry analysis. Please see Strategy 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2] for more information.\nStrategy 2: Exploiting the difference in fluorescence properties between leukocytes and erythrocytes\nTiming: 50 min",
    "This strategy involves the use of fluorescent dyes and conjugated antibodies and is predicated on achieving a bright signal for identifying fluorescent triggered events. The method is based on the original strategy reported by Hallermann et al. (1964)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] in which acridine orange was used to show leukocyte staining in fresh human whole blood.\nIn this protocol, we describe a strategy for flow cytometric identification of leukocytes in which staining and analytical flow cytometry facilitate the detection and quantification of subpopulations of leukocytes as a reference for avoiding potential artifacts related to sample manipulation, such as those related to red cell lysing, centrifugation and washing steps, or alternatively in pathological specimens resistant to hemolysis. Target cells can be stained with viable DNA probes alone, or in combination with fluorescent conjugates and other fluorescent markers. Please note that some stains tend to be very bright with extensive spectral bleed across multiple channels, so this must be considered for panel design. Multi-laser excitation can often be leveraged to minimize color compensation. Importantly, all stains should be previously titrated to determine concentrations allowing the optimal fluorescence intensity and high signal to noise ratio. We recommend performing kinetic analysis as we previously described (Fornas et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]), or alternately employing batteries of dilutions aimed at quantifying optimal concentrations.",
    "The differentiation of leukocytes and erythrocytes can be easily validated using fluorescent conjugates and viable nucleic acid stains, either used to target CD45-expressing cells or living nucleated cells. The fluorescent threshold will then capture only CD45+ (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) or alternatively nucleated cells (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]), and will contribute to dramatically increasing throughput, even allowing identification of rare cells. We have routinely used this method for CD34+ cell discrimination (Rico et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Alvarez-Larran et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Fornas et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). The identification of nucleated red blood cells can also be validated using fluorescent conjugates used to target CD45 negative cells, in combination with glycophorin A (GpA), a sialoglycoprotein expressed on human red blood cells and erythroid precursor cells, useful for red cell differentiation studies, as we previously described in Cytometry Part B (Fornas et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1100-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. CD34+ progenitor counting in mobilized peripheral blood\nThreshold was set on FITC-CD45 fluorescence (A) to discriminate erythrocytes, platelets and debris. CD45+ events were subsequently gated on BSSC vs. VSSC (B), FSC vs. SSC (C), FITC-CD45 vs. PE-CD34 (D) and VSSC vs. PE-CD34 (E). Region (R) 2 comprehends CD34+ progenitor cells, which are further gated in VSCC vs. FSC (F) and selected in R3.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1100-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Region (R) 1 was set in a BSSC vs. DCV-H dot-plot (A) to include nucleated cell events and applied in a DCV-H vs. DCV-A dot-plot (B) for doublet discrimination. R2 including single cells was applied in a FSC-H vs. BSSC-H dot-plot (C) to gate leukocytes (R3). R3 was gated in a BSSC vs. FITC-CD45 dot-plot (D) to select CD45+ events in R4, which was applied to display CD34+ in a PE-CD34-H vs. BSSC-H dot plot (E) and in a PE-CD34-H vs. FITC-CD45-H dot plot (F).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1100-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

CD45 and CD34 fluorescence was plotted to identify CD34 positive cells (E). Blue vs. Violet SSC was used to exclude coincident events (F). Violet SCC vs. CD45 fluorescence was used to select CD34+ events in R3 (G) and subsequently gated on light scatter (H), on light scatter singlets (I) and on fluorescent singlets (J).\nCell-permeant DNA stains are available in several colors. We routinely use Vybrant DyeCycle Violet (DCV), and Hoechst 33342 with violet excitation. Vybrant DyeCycle Ruby (DCR) Stain can be used on a 488 nm or 635 nm red laser. Green and Orange DyeCycle stains can also be used and adapted for multicolor panel design.\nFlow cytometer set-up\nTiming: 10 min\nCreate a new experiment or protocol.\nWhen possible, insert the filter components needed into appropriate locations to collect the violet side-scatter.
