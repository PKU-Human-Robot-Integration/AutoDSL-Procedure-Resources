Incubate the tubes at 37 &#xB0;C overnight \\(12 to 16 hr).\n  6. Spin to bring the sample digest to the bottom of the tube.",
    "**NB:** The volume of the sample digest must be less than 50 &#xB5;l. If the volume of the sample digest is greater than 50 &#xB5;l, lyophilise and then reconstitute with 30 &#xB5;l Dissolution Buffer.\n_Labelling the Protein Digests with the iTRAQ Reagents_\n&#xA0;1.
