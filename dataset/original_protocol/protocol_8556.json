    "1. Installation, Data Preparation, and Launching QNsim1.0\nDownload \"QNsim1.0.zip\" (provided as a supplement) and extract it to a desired directory.\nPrepare stimulated DA response data for modeling with the software program by organizing a spreadsheet in which each column contains a temporal DA response converted to µM DA concentrations. Save this (.xlsx) file to the same directory as the program files.\n\tNote: The spreadsheet can contain multiple responses in an individual experiment or multiple studies containing a fixed number of responses (see \"Sample.xlsx\" for an example).\nOpen the programming environment software, navigate to the \"QNSim1.0\" directory in the \"Current Folder\" window, and open the filed entitled \"Initialization.m.\" Click \"Run\" to launch the initialization screen (Figure 1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55595/55595fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Initialization Screen. This screen allows users to continue an existing project, by entering a previous *.mat project file (left), or to begin a new project from stored data of stimulated DA neurotransmission (right). Textboxes are provided to input the *.xlsx filename containing the data, a few essential descriptors of the data, and the *.mat project filename that will contain all the data relating to the project.

Initialization of the Simulation Environment\nNote: The initialization screen allows users to begin a new project (step 2.1) or continue with a previously saved project (step 2.2).\nOption 1: Beginning a new project\nUnder the New Project section, type in the name of the spreadsheet file that contains the DA response data for the project (e.g., Sample.xlsx) into the [DA] Data file textbox.\n\t\tNote: The file must be in the same folder as the program files.",
    "Next to Simulation time, input the time points corresponding to the start and end of data collection (in seconds) relative to the start of the stimulation. For example, if the data collection begins 5 s before the stimulation and ends 35 s after, as in the Sample.xlsx, input \"-5\" and \"35.\"\nInput the number of responses in each study next to the corresponding text box.\nNext to sampling interval, input the experimental data sampling interval in seconds.\nNext to Save as (.mat), designate the filename, including the file type (.mat) where the project is to be saved.\n\t\tNote: This is the file that will be accessed to create the simulations, and all work can be saved to this project file.\nClick Create New Project to launch the Simulator window (Figure 2).\nOption 2: Continuing a previous project\nIn the Continue Previous Project section of the Initialization window, enter the.mat filename of a previously begun project (e.g., Sample.mat).\n\t\tNote: This file must be contained within the same folder as the software program files.\nClick Load Existing Project to launch the Simulator window (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55595/55595fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Simulator Screen. The simulator screen allows users to select the experimental data in D and adjust simulation parameters in E to model the experimental data. Visual inspection of (A, B, and C) can then aid in the refinement of simulation parameters so that the simulation (blue dashed lines) models the experimental data (thick green lines). Here, (A) contains experimental and simulated DA concentration versus time data. (B) is a graph that aids in estimating post-stimulation DA release. (C) is a plot of the experimental and simulated first derivatives of DA concentration versus time data from A or the rate of evoked overflow (EO). The rate of EO is theoretically a balance of release-reuptake rates, which is superimposed on this graph.

Using the Simulator Window\nNote: The Simulator screen allows for selecting the experimental data to model (step 3.1), adjust parameters to simulate experimental DA response data (step 3.2), save/load modeling parameters for each DA response (step 3.3), and export the saved parameters (step 3.4).\nSelecting the experimental DA response to simulate.\nSelect the experimental DA response to simulate by inputting the study number, response number, and duration of the stimulation in the corresponding textboxes. Press the \"enter\" key or click simulate to begin the simulation process, which creates 3 graphs containing experimental data (thick green lines), simulated data (blue dashed lines), and simulated data that does not account for post-stimulation DA release (red dotted lines), as in Figure 2.\nModeling experimental DA responses.",
    "Note: The objective of modeling is to adjust the model parameters relating to stimulated DA release (step 3.2.1), DA reuptake (step 3.2.2), and post-stimulation DA release (step 3.2.3) to accurately model experimental DA responses. Modeling is an iterative process whereby the starting parameters are refined until the parameters yield a simulated DA response that approximates the experimental data in the DA versus Time graph (Panel A), which can be aided by fitting the simulated data to the experimentally derived data in the Estimated post-stimulation component graph(Panel B)and the Rates of release, reuptake, and EO graph (Panel C).\n\t\nAdjust the ΔDAR, ΔDARτ, and DARss parameters associated with DA release (Equation 2) to match the amplitude of the stimulation.\n\t\tNote: These parameters are only starting estimates that will get refined, but ΔDARτ=25 and a DARss value that is 1/5th of ΔDAR are satisfactory starting conditions. Increasing any of these parameters will increase the amplitude in the DA versus Time graph and increase the DA release rate in the Estimated post-stimulation release component and Rates of release, reuptake, and EO graphs.\nAdjust the Vmax, Kmi, ΔKm, Kminf, and k parameters associated with to DA reuptake (Equation 4), such that in Panel A, the simulated data approximates the shape of the rising phase of the experimental data (thick green line) and such that the simulation w/o post-stim release trace (red dotted line) is less than the experimental data trace for all post-stimulation time points.\n\t\tNote: This step likely requires readjusting DA release parameters (step 3.2.1).\nAdjust the XR, τR, and m parameters associated with post-stimulation DA release (Equation 3), such that the simulation approximates the experimental data in the DA versus Time graph.\n\t\tNote: XR should take on a value between 0 and 1 and should generally be greater than 0.7.",
    "Saving/loading the modeling parameters.\nOnce a set of parameters closely models the experimental data, click Save Parameters, which will save that set of parameters for the given response to the.mat file for the project.\nIf required, load previously saved parameters for a particular response by clicking Load Parameters. Ensure that the appropriate study number and response number are inputted in the corresponding text boxes.\nExporting saved parameters.\nIn the textbox next to the Export Parameters button, type in the filename (e.g., Sample.txt) and click Export Parameters to export a text file with all the parameters of the simulations. Delimit the text file using spaces to generate a spreadsheet of parameters, as in Figure 4 of the Representative Results section below.\nSubscription Required.
