    "GBM specimen was acquired from a patient during a routine operation after obtaining fully informed consent by human research ethics committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.\n1. Isolation and culture of patient-derived GSCs\nPlace fresh surgically resected glioblastoma tissue in a 15 mL centrifuge tube filled with sterile PBS and store the tissue on ice until further operation.\nMince the GBM tissue into approximately 0.5 to 1 mm diameter pieces using dissection scissors and wash the tissue specimens with neuronal basal medium to remove cellular debris in a biosafety cabinet.\nDigest the tissue fragments with 1 mg/mL collagenase A at 37 °C for 30 min and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant and suspend the pellet with blank neuronal basal medium and dissociate the pellet mechanically by repetitive pipetting on ice.\nCulture the mixture in ultra-low attachment 6-well culture plates filled with GSC culture medium (see Table 1 for the recipe) in a sterile cell incubator with 5% CO2 and 90% humidity at 37 °C until neurosphere formation.\nOn sufficient neurosphere formation, collect them using a pipette in a 1.5 mL microtube and centrifuge at 800 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend the pellet and split it into several flasks filled with the above culture medium for maintaining the primary GSCs.\n\tNOTE: Patient-derived GSCs used in the example were derived from surgical biopsies of a 34-year-old male patient with WHO grade IV recurrent GBM. The GSCs were named as XG387 for the future experiments. PCR-based mycoplasma tests were performed for the above GSCs to confirm no mycoplasma contamination is present. All the experiments involving GSCs used in this protocol were carried out <15 passages.\n2. Preparing luciferase-tagged GSCs",
    "Collect the GSCs from the medium culture and centrifuge them at 70 x g for 3 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant, digest the cells with accutase for 4 min at 37 °C. Use a 200 µL tip and pipette repeatedly to dissociate and resuspend the cell pellet.\nDilute the cells to 2 x 105 cells per well in a 12-well culture plate and culture the cells overnight.\nAdd 30 µL luciferase-EGFP virus supernatant (titer >108 TU /mL) into each well in the plate and then centrifuge the cells at 1,000 x g for 2 h at 25 °C. Culture the cells overnight.\nRefresh the medium the next day and culture the cells for another 48 h.\nObserve the cells under a florescent microscope to confirm the appearance of the GFP positive cells.\nUse a flow cell sorter to sort and select the GSCs with high GFP fluorescence to culture the cells further.\n3. Bio-luminescence based measurement of cell viability\nCoating plates with the extracellular matrix (ECM) mixture (e.g., Matrigel): Add 40 µL of 0.15 mg/mL ECM mixture to each well and incubate the plate for 1 h at 37 °C. Remove the excess ECM mixture and gently rinse once with PBS.\nAdd 100 µL culture medium containing 15,000, 10,000, 8,000, 6,000, 4,000, 2,000, 1,000, and 500 XG387-Luc cells together with 100 µL blank medium as control into each well for 6 replicates in a 96-well optical bottom plate and culture the cells overnight at 37 °C.\nRemove the supernatant, add 50 µL culture medium containing 150 ng/µL D-luciferin into each well and incubate the cells for 5 min at 37 °C.",
    "Take images of the cellular bio-luminescence in the plate using the IVIS spectrum imaging system. Use the built-in software to create multiple circular areas of the region of interest (ROI) and quantify the cellular bio-luminescence.\n4. Temozolomide treatment and combination screening\nPrecoat four 96-well plates as described above, prior to the treatment.\nSeed XG387-Luc cells at a density of 1,000 cells in 100 µL culture medium into each well of a 96-well optical bottom plate and culture the cells overnight.\nPrepare temozolomide and the targeted agents from the stock solution in advance. Prepare a concentration series composed of 800 µM, 600 µM, 400 µM, 300 µM, 200 µM, 100 µM, and 50 µM temozolomide in culture medium for the single-agent treatment. Dilute temozolomide and the targeted agents in stock solution in the culture medium, respectively, to obtain final concentrations of 200 µM and 2 µM for combination drug screening (Table 2).\nRemove the culture medium when most of the GSCs adhere to the bottom of the plates; add the above-prepared medium containing temozolomide into each well for three technical replicates per treatment.\nTo treat Temozolomide and to screen the drug combinations remove the blank medium and add the above-prepared medium containing either 200 µM temozolomide, or 2 µM targeted agent, or a combination of both into each well for three technical replicates per treatment.\nIncubate all plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3 days.\nRemove the drug-containing medium, add 50 µL blank medium containing 150 ng/µL D-luciferin into each well and incubate the cells for 5 min at 37 °C.\nTake images of the cellular bio-luminescence in the plate using the IVIS spectrum imaging system. Use the built-in software to create multiple circular ROIs and quantify the cellular bio-luminescence.",
    "5. Combination treatment of temozolomide and UMI-77 in XG387-Luc and XG328-Luc cell lines\nPrecoat three 96-well plates as described above, prior to the treatment.\nSeed XG387-Luc and XG328-Luc cells at a density of 1,000 cells respectively in 100 µL of culture medium into each well of a 96-well optical bottom plate and culture the cells overnight.\nPrepare a concentration series composed of 600 µM, 400 µM, 300 µM, 200 µM, 100 µM, 50 µM, and 0 µM temozolomide and a concentration series composed of 6 µM, 4 µM, 3 µM, 2 µM, 1 µM, 0.5 µM, and 0 µM UMI-77 in the culture medium for six-by-six dose titration matrix treatments.\nRemove the blank medium when most of the GSCs adhere to the bottom of the plate; add the above-prepared medium into each well for three technical replicates per treatment.\nIncubate these plates for 3 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nRemove the drug-containing medium; add 50 µL of blank medium containing 150 ng/µL D-luciferin into each well and incubate the cells for 5 min at 37 °C for bioluminescence measurement.\n6. Data analysis\nCalculate the sensitivity Index (SI) score of temozolomide and targeted agent according to the formula in Figure 2A.\n\tNOTE: The SI score is to quantify the influence of the addition of another drug. It ranged from -1 to +1, with positive values indicating temozolomide synergistic effects.\nCalculate the combination index (CI) values between temozolomide and UMI-77 using CompuSyn software to analyze their combined interactions. CI value <1 indicates synergy; CI value >1 indicates antagonism.\nCalculate the high single agent (HSA) values between temozolomide and UMI-77 using Combenefit software. HSA value indicates the combined inhibitory effect. HSA value >0 indicates synergy and the HSA value <0 indicates antagonism.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
