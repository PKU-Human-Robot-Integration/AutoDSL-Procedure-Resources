    "The UAS-GAL4 dependent and RNAi mediated knockdown of genes in Drosophila requires several steps. It includes steps like rearing the organism, setting up genetic crosses, harvesting larvae of desired genetic combination, RNA isolation and knockdown assessment, dissections, immunostaining, and phenotypic analysis. Mentioned below is the general scheme of tissue preparation and processing (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3924/bioprotoc-11-04-3924-g002.jpgFigure 2. A flow chart with details of the protocol Genetic crosses for RNAi mediated knockdownGrow +/+; Actin5C-GAL4/CyO-GFP; UAS-Dicer/UAS-Dicer flies in large numbers in vials containing fly media.Collect virgin females having the GAL4 driver in a separate media vial.Grow RNAi and wild type (w1118) flies in separate media vials to get sufficient male flies.Place 6-7 virgin driver females and 2-3 UAS-RNAi males of the same age (3-4 days old) inside a fresh media vial to establish a mating cross.For the control cross, use w1118 males instead of UAS-RNAi males and set up the cross with virgin females as in Step A4.Incubate vials with flies for the genetic cross at room temperature for 24 h.According to the experimental design, shift them to 28 °C, 25 °C, or 18 °C.Note: Incubation at a higher temperature allows higher GAL4 activity inducing increased RNAi expression. Keep crosses in an incubator set at the desired temperature until the third instar larvae are visible.Remove adult flies and put 2-3 ml water or 2% sucrose solution to harvest larvae from the media's top layer.Note: Steps A8 to A13 are in Figure 3. Using a paintbrush, mix the upper layer of food and water and collect it in a clean plastic dish.Separate third instar larvae in a clean distilled water/phosphate buffer saline containing plate.Wash collected larvae 2-3 times with water to clean them.",
    "Segregate non-GFP larvae (+/+; Actin5C/RNAi; UAS-Dicer/+, indicating the desired genetic combination of Driver and RNAi) from GFP (+/+; RNAi/CyoGFP; UAS-Dicer/+) larvae for subsequent processing.For the control, use non-GFP larvae from the control cross as described in Step A5.Dissect the salivary gland or the head complex of Actin5C-GAL4 driven RNAi from the non-GFP third instar larvae in PBS.Note: Refer to Figure 3 below and Steps 1-5 mentioned in Part-C for details of salivary gland dissection. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3924/bioprotoc-11-04-3924-g003.jpgFigure 3.

RNAi mediated knockdown reduces the specific RNA levels to affect the gene function. RNA digesting enzyme, RNaseA is a very stable and active protein; thus, taking proper precaution and using RNase inactivating solution like RNaseZAP is necessary.Prepare DEPC treated water for use (see Recipes).Make sure to use barrier tips, RNase-free microcentrifuge tube (MCT), and glassware.Put larvae inside a clean RNase-free MCT, flash freeze, and store for RNA isolation.",
    "Dissect sufficient salivary glands from larvae and flash freeze glands inside liquid nitrogen.Crush the salivary gland/larva using RNase free pestle and follow the manufacturer's protocol for RNA extraction given in the kit.Crush flash-frozen tissues directly using a pestle or first add lysis solution from the RNA isolation kit and then crush the tissue or larva in the solution.If adding the lysis solution before crushing, add half of the lysis buffer's final volume, and properly crush the tissue/larva. Subsequently, add the remaining lysis buffer.Check the purity of RNA using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer/nanodrop. A260/280 and A260/230 ratio equal to 2.0-2.2 suggests pure RNA. Lower values of these ratios indicate the presence of contaminants like proteins, carbohydrates, or phenol.In an MCT, heat the purified RNA sample at 65 °C for 10 min in a 25% formamide containing RNA loading dye.Keep RNA sample tubes on ice for 2 min and load immediately on the EtBr containing 1% agarose gel made in Tris-Acetate EDTA (TAE) buffer and run the gel to check the integrity of the isolated RNA.Prepare cDNA as per instruction given with the BioRad cDNA synthesis kit and store at -20 °C until further use.A typical cDNA synthesis reaction in 20 µl final volume contains 1 µg purified RNA, 1× iScript reaction mixture, 1 µl of iScript reverse transcriptase enzyme.Reaction steps include 5 min of priming at 25 °C, 20 min of reverse transcription at 46 °C, and 1 min of inactivation at 95 °C.Use gene-specific primers (200 nM) on prepared cDNA and run a typical PCR reaction (see Table 1 for primer sequences).Note: We used a standard annealing temperature (Ta) of 55 °C for all semiquantitative PCR. Use RpL49 primers as an internal control gene in the PCR reaction (see Table 1 for primer sequences).Table 1.",

Semiquantitative PCR based assessment of knockdown. cDNAs prepared from Control and nucleoporin knockdown used in a PCR reaction. Upper panels show levels of Nup160 (A), Nup107 (B), and Sec13 (C) from control and knockdown tissues. RpL49 served as an internal loading control between control and knockdown samples.Dissection and Staining of Salivary glandSalivary gland is post-mitotic tissue and carries large nuclei. It possesses polytene chromosomes, which serve as excellent model tissue in several cytological studies and gene expression analyses. The loss of nucleoporins and consequent perturbations in nuclear pore assembly and functions can be studied using immunostaining. dElys was knocked down in the salivary glands using RNAi. Subsequent steps in the dissection of salivary glands in immunostaining are the following.Dissect out salivary glands in PBS on a silicone elastomer plate from 20 third instar larvae.Note: Replace PBS solution after every 2-3 dissections. Grab the larva approximately at the middle portion of its size using forceps.Use Dumont 5 forceps to grab the mouth-hook and pull out the head complex.Simultaneously remove the gut region and other carcass tissues using Dumont 55 forceps.Use pointed Dumont 5 forceps to grab the head complex by mouth-hook all this while.Clean the dissected salivary gland by removing the brain, imaginal discs, and fat tissue and ensure that the mouth-hook remains attached.After dissecting each salivary gland, immediately transfer it to an MCT containing 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde.After all the salivary glands are dissected and collected, keep the MCT on an orbital shaker with gentle agitation for 40 min at room temperature.Note: Fixation should not go beyond 1 h; otherwise, the tissue becomes fragile, and staining is affected.",
    "Remove paraformaldehyde and wash tissues three times with PBS-T for 10 min each.Note: Do all the wash steps carefully to avoid the loss of salivary glands. It applies to all subsequent steps. Dissecting the salivary gland with the mouth hook attached to it gives an additional advantage that we can easily see the salivary gland, and thus their loss will be restricted.Block salivary glands in 3% normal goat serum containing PBS-T or 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS-T.Keep at room temperature for 1 h on an orbital shaker with 110 rotations per minute (rpm).Note: Perform all incubations/wash on an orbital shaker set at 110 rpm. Add 200 µl of anti-dElys and mAb414 primary antibodies containing solution (1:800 dilution of each of the two antibodies prepared in PBS-T).Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a shaker.Wash samples three times with 200 µl of PBS-T for 10 min each at room temperature (25 °C).Add 200 µl of Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa Fluor-568 conjugated secondary antibodies dilution (1:800 dilution prepared in PBS-T) and incubate at room temperature (25 °C) for 1.5-2.0 h.Wash samples three times with 200 µl of PBS-T, 10 min each at room temperature (25 °C).Put 15 µl of Fluoroshield with DAPI mounting medium.Pick all salivary glands using a cut 200 µl pipette tip.Note: Cut the sample inlet end of the fine 200 µl pipette tip to avoid any tissue damage. Place salivary glands on a previously cleaned slide and spread the tissue gently using Dumont 55 forceps.Note: Do not damage the tissue while spreading. Use the mouth hook to grab the tissue, only if required. Carefully place a clean coverslip on the tissue.Avoid trapping air bubbles between the slide and coverslip.Gently remove the excess mounting medium using tissue paper and seal the coverslip edges with transparent nail polish.",
    "Observe processed tissue under a fluorescent Leica microscope.On Zeiss  LSM780  , use the control slide to adjust settings and focus in a field with a clear view of cells.Scan the field having salivary gland nuclei under 63× objective in a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope  LSM780  .Capture images from different visual fields of the control slide (Figure 5).Reuse the same settings for the knockdown samples also.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3924/bioprotoc-11-04-3924-g005.jpgFigure 5.

The fourth panels represent the merged images. Scale bars =10 μm.Wing and Eye specific knockdownSet up crosses between nup160 RNAi and +/+; Ey-GAL4/Ey-GAL4; UAS-Dicer/UAS-Dicer (for eye-specific knockdown) or nup160 RNAi and +/+; wg-GAL4/Wg-GAL4; UAS-Dicer/UAS-Dicer (for wing-specific knockdown).Transfer crosses to a lower temperature (18 °C). The lower temperature reduces the GAL4 activity.Reduced GAL4 activity at 18 °C causes a reduction in knockdown levels and allows adult fly emergence.Dissection and visualization of eyes and wingsVisualization of eyesDrosophila compound eyes are complex yet pertinent tissue to observe growth defects upon RNAi mediated knockdown. A definite transcriptional paradigm regulates the arrangement of each ommatidium in the compound eye during development. Any perturbation in the ommatidium arrangement, their smooth morphology, and the presence of a bristle with each ommatidium due to RNAi mediated knockdown serves to indicate the importance of the gene function. After knocking down the Nup160 using RNAi, process wings in the following manner. If the gene of interest induces embryonic to larval lethality, eye-specific knockdown helps assess the gene function. After knocking down the Nup160 using RNAi, process compound eyes in the following manner.Collect adult flies in an empty vial.",
    "Apply 100-200 µl of diethyl ether on cotton and plug the fly containing vial to anesthetize them.Orient them properly (compound eye facing up) under Stereomicroscope Leica  S6E  .Fix the position of the fly using carbon conductive tape for steady observation of eyes.Observe eye morphology using Leica fluorescent stereomicroscope  M205 FA  at ×123 magnification (left panels in Figure 6A).SEM analysis of eye phenotypeAnesthetize the flies using diethyl ether. Flash freeze them and separate heads from the body.Fix head tissues with 2.5% Glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C.Wash with PBS and 4% sucrose solution.Dehydrate tissue using a series of graded ethanol wash (single wash with 25%, 50%, 75% ethanol, and twice with 100% ethanol) for 2 h each at room temperature.Keep inside a lab desiccator for critical point drying.Mount dried tissue on aluminum stubs with carbon-conductive tape.Coat the flies with gold particles in a sputter coating apparatus.Image using Zeiss Gemini II FESEM with In lens detector (middle and right panels in Figure 6A).Visualization of wingsDrosophila adult wings serve as an excellent tissue to observe the developmental defects induced by perturbation in a gene function. The changes in bristles, wing veins, and notched wings are distinct phenotypes seen with the knockdown of genes. Wing imaginal discs are present in the third instar larva. If the gene of interest induces post-larval lethality, wing imaginal discs are routinely analyzed. After knocking down the Nup160 using RNAi, process wings for visualization in the following manner.Follow Steps E1a and E1b of the visualization of eyes procedure.Cut the wings with scissors and place them on a clean slide.Put coverslip on top of the wing tissue and seal.Observe under upright light microscope Leica DM2500 at 10× magnification (panels in Figure 6B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3924/bioprotoc-11-04-3924-g006.jpgFigure 6.
