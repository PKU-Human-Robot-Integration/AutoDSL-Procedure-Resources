    "Sample proteins required for this experiment and a list of reagents are found in the Table of Materials. Equivalent proteins should be produced for the user's system of study to measure conformation changes.\n1. 3D printed magnetic lid\nDesign a microplate lid to house the magnets within a 24-well microplate. An example CAD file can be downloaded from GitHub12. The measurements are shown in Figure 1.\n\tNOTE: The height of the pedestal can be altered to change the distance between magnets and surface to alter the applied force. In addition, the final force exerted upon the particle depends on the particle size and gap between the pair of magnets. Equations to calculate the applied force for 1 µm and 2.8 µm particles at 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm gaps are given in Dos Santos et al.8. For the experiments described here with 2.8 µm particles and a 2 mm gap, use Equation 1.\n\tEquation 1: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62994/62994eq01.jpg\n3D print a microplate lid using Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG) on a 3D printer system.\n\tNOTE: Use a printer with a layer resolution of 0.02 mm to enable accuracy and reproducibility. The impact of printer accuracy was discussed in Dos Santos et al.8.\nAttach pairs of 5 mm cube Neodymium N42 magnets using adhesive to the pedestals with the magnetic poles orientated to create the field directed towards the bottom of the microplate.\nLeave at least 1 position empty to act as a no-magnet control.\nStore in a sealed container of sufficient size to readily place and remove the lid.\n2. Microplate surface modification\nTake a clean non-treated glass-bottomed 24-well microplate.\nWash the wells 3x with 500 µL of wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mM NaCl) at room temperature.",
    "Add 200 µL of biotin-BSA (0.2 mg/mL) in the wash buffer and leave it undisturbed for 15 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Biotin-BSA is used for both passivation and attachment. Other passivation and surface attachment strategies can be used. For first-time use and optimization, the concentration of biotin-BSA can be varied up to 1 mg/mL.\nWash the wells 3x with 500 µL of wash buffer.\nAdd 200 µL of streptavidin (20 µg/mL) in the wash buffer and leave it undisturbed for 15 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: For first-time use, the concentration of streptavidin can be varied up to 1 mg/mL.\nRemove the solution and then wash the wells 3x with wash buffer.\nCover the wells with 500 µL of wash buffer.\nStore at 4 °C until ready to use. Plates should be used on the same day.\n3. Sample preparation: Protein immobilization\nAllow the surface-modified microplate to reach room temperature.\nWash the wells with 500 µL of wash buffer.\nAdd 100 nM biotin-eGFP-Myosin VI Tail-mRFP (stock sample protein) and incubate for 15 min at room temperature in wash buffer.\n\tNOTE: This example protein is produced as described by Dos Santos et al.8. Concentrations and incubations times can vary depending upon the protein.\nWash the wells 3x with 500 µL of wash buffer.\nSet up the plate reader to record fluorescence spectra for GFP (excitation 490 nm and emission 510-600 nm) and RFP (excitation 560 nm and emission 580-650nm) to confirm the presence of the fusion proteins.\nIf there is a lack of protein, increase the concentration at step 3.3.\n\tNOTE: Poor binding could relate to inadequate biotin-BSA and/or streptavidin binding, and therefore, the amounts could be increased 10-fold.\nIf possible, perform a well-scan measurement to determine if the fusion protein is bound across the microplate (Figure 2).",
    "NOTE: This measurement will record the fluorescence intensity at specific points across the microplate well. It will reveal if the protein is bound across the well.\nEnsure that the signal is uniform (within 5%) in the center of the well where the assay measurement occurs.\n4. Magnetic bead preparation\nVortex the vial of 2.8 µm paramagnetic beads with recombinant Protein A (Table of Materials) for 30 s to resuspend the beads.\nTransfer the volume corresponding to 1 mg of paramagnetic beads to a 1.5 mL tube.\nPlace the tube in a magnetic isolator (Table of Materials) and then remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 200 µL of PBS by gently pipetting the solution up and down.\nPlace the tube in the magnetic isolator and then remove the supernatant.\nRepeat the wash step 3x.\nDilute 10 µg of Anti-RFP antibody in 200 µL of PBS.\nIsolate the beads in the magnetic isolator and then resuspend in the antibody solution.\nRotate at 20 rpm for 10 min at room temperature on a benchtop rotator.\nPlace the tube in the magnetic isolator and remove the supernatant.\nWash 3x in PBS.\nResuspend the beads in 200 µL of wash buffer.\nTo confirm antibody immobilization on the beads, incubate the antibody-loaded beads with a solution of >1 µM RFP fusion protein.\n\tNOTE: Confirm visually whether the protein is isolated by the beads.\nAlternatively, measure the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant (excitation 560 nm and emission 580-650nm) for RFP in a fluorescence spectrometer.\n5. Sample preparation: Bead attachment\nAdd 10 µg of the paramagnetic bead-antibody fusion diluted in wash buffer (200 µL) to the protein-bound microplate wells.",
    "Do not place beads in one control well to check for the effect of beads on the fluorescent signal. Prepare a control sample without antibodies to determine any non-specific interactions with the beads.\nIncubate the microplate at room temperature for 30 min.\nWash the wells 3x with 500 µL of wash buffer.\nIf available locally, check that the beads are bound to the surface on a brightfield microscope. If there is a lack of beads, increase the concentration in step 5.1 to 500 µg/mL.\n6. Data acquisition\nPlace the microplate, without lid, into a fluorescent plate reader at 25 °C.\nSet up the plate reader to record fluorescence spectra for GFP (excitation 490 nm and emission 510-600 nm) and RFP (excitation 560 nm and emission 580-650 nm) to confirm the presence of the fusion proteins.\n\tNOTE: Measure/record the fluorescence spectra through the bottom of the microplate to place the lid on top. Therefore, a suitable microplate reader should be selected.\nRecord a FRET fluorescence spectrum (excitation 490 nm and emission 510-650nm), or monitor fluorescence at 510 nm and 610 nm with excitation at 490 nm. This is set up according to the manufacturer's guidance.\nRemove the microplate from the reader and add the magnetic lid.\nReturn to the plate reader and leave the sample for 2 min.\nRepeat the FRET measurement, as in step 6.3.\n7. Data analysis\nExport the data for import into a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel).\nManually extract the data for Donor GFP at 510 nm and acceptor RFP at 610 nm.\nCalculate relative FRET using Equation 2 for each condition.\n\tEquation 2: imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62994/62994eq02.jpg\n\tA: acceptor intensity (RFP 610 nm), D: donor intensity (GFP 510 nm).\n\tNOTE: Use the recombinant RFP under the same excitation and emission conditions to control for the background excitation of the acceptor.",
