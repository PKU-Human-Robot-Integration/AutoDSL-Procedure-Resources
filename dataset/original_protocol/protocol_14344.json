    "All animal experiments were done in accordance with Dutch law, and protocols were approved by the Committee of Animal Experimentation of the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\n1. Recipient Mouse\nWhen the transgenic mice are born, screen the animals for the appropriate genotype using standard procedures9.\n\tNOTE: In this manuscript, data obtained from an eNOStag-GFP line9 developed in-house and a purchased ROSA-mTmG (stock 007676)10 line are presented.\nUse mice that are 12 weeks old or older and that are above 20 g.\n2. Donor Mouse\nNOTE: A tumor fragment for implantation in the dorsal window is obtained from a non-transgenic donor animal. Depending on the tumor type, normal (with syngeneic tumors) or immunodeficient (xenografts) mice are used.\nGrow the tumor cells in a medium with the appropriate supplements in culture flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the medium from the cell flasks, wash once with 1x PBS, and detach the cells using 0.25% trypsin.\nInactivate the trypsin by adding cell culture medium. Collect the cells, spin down at 1,200 x g for 5 min, and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of PBS.\nDilute 20 µL of the cell suspension with 20 µL of trypan blue, which stains dead cells. Count the number of living and dead cells using a hemocytometer; the number of dead cells should not exceed 10%.\nSpin the cells again at 1,200 x g for 5 min and resuspend the cell pellet in ice-cold PBS, yielding 1 million cells per 100 µL. Transport the cells on ice to the operating room.\nAnesthetize the animal using isoflurane/O2. Turn on the oxygen and adjust the flow to 0.5 mL/min. Adjust the isoflurane vaporizer to 3%. After a few minutes, place the mouse in the anesthesia chamber.",
    "NOTE: Prefill the chamber to ensure it is ready for use to  minimize stress.\nWhen the mouse is sedated, bring the animal to the operating heating table, kept at 37 °C, and place the snout in the anesthesia nose cone.\nNOTE: The animal is properly sedated when no reaction to a footpad pinch is noted.\nShave the mouse to better visualize the injection site. Inoculate using a 0.5 mL insulin syringe; inject 100 µL of cells into the flank of the mouse and allow a tumor to develop.\nEuthanize the animal by cervical dislocation under anesthesia as approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  Using micro scissors and forceps, cut open the skin at the location of the tumor and dissect the tumor. Put the tumor in a Petri dish with PBS. Using micro scissors and forceps, cut the tumor into fragments of approximately 1 mm3 (Figure 1A-a).\n\tNOTE: The tumor of the donor mouse should be big enough to give sufficient material, but large, necrotic tumors should be avoided. For most tumors, an average diameter of 10 mm suffices.\n3. Implantation of the Window Chamber\nPerform all procedures under aseptic conditions. Autoclave the surgical instruments (Figure 1A) and chamber materials (Figure 1B).",
    "NOTE: The window chamber used here, with a total weight of 1.1 g, is made of polyether ether ketone (PEEK), a light, synthetic material that is MRI compatible. PEEK is 3.4-fold lighter than titanium, which is commonly used in the literature for these windows. It is resistant to most chemicals, is inert, does not provoke immune reactions, and is sturdy. This window is also smaller in design compared to previously published windows. Mice fitted with this window show full capacity of motion, can climb, and gain weight comparably to mice without a window chamber. Because the animal can bite on the window, synthetic windows may last a little shorter compared to titanium windows; however, they are easy to make and are inexpensive. These particular windows are made in-house and can be acquired upon request.\nSedate the recipient mouse using inhalation anesthetics (i.e., isoflurane/O2) in an anesthesia chamber. Bring the mouse to the heated operating table kept at 37 °C and place the snout in the anesthesia nose cone (see step 2.6). Apply eye ointment to avoid dryness.\nRemove the hair from the entire back by shaving and applying hair removal gel. Take care that all gel is removed by rinsing the animal carefully with hand-warm tap water. Dry the animal and clean the skin with 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: The shaving procedure can also be done the day before window implantation. The cream need to be removed thoroughly with hand-warm water as this can cause skin irritation.",
    "Mark the center line on the mouse spine with a marker to ensure the symmetrical positioning of chamber. Reposition the mouse, pull the skin into a flap using the center line as a folding position, and grasp the middle of flap. Position the window such that the top of the frame is at least 2 mm below the center line and circle the window view area on the skin with a marker.\nUsing a scalpel holder/blade size of 15 and micro scissors, remove the skin along the drawn circular line. Be careful not to damage underlying fascia.\n\tNOTE: This creates the window view area of the chamber in which the tumor is transplanted.\nPull up the skinfold and use an ear puncher to punch holes 1 mm in diameter through the skin, one on either side of the view area (Figure 1A-b).\n\tNOTE: These are holes for two bolts to fix the window frames together.\nPlace the custom-made front chamber frame using bolts (Figures 1B-a, 1B-c) and position the back frame (Figure 1B-b) on the bolts. Place nuts (Figure 1B-d) at the back frame on the bolts.\n\tNOTE: These bolts are used to fix the chambers together against the skinfold and are later used to immobilize the chamber during evaluation under the microscope.\nPull the skin 2-3 mm above the top of the frames and make sure that the transplantable window view area matches the chamber area. Place 23 G needles through the two little suture holes (Figure 1B, black arrow) at the top of the frame. Tighten the nuts on the bolts with a micro screwdriver (Figure 1A-c) and a clamping needle holder to immobilize the nuts.\n\tNOTE: Take precautions to ensure that the skin does not turn around the bolts, and do not tighten too much.",
    "Replace the needles with sutures, starting at the top, to fix the frames against the skin. Do this for the 5 pairs of suture holes (Figure 1B, white arrow) in the frame.\nTurn the mouse to reveal the backside of the window chamber. Place a thick piece of filler glass with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 0.55 mm (Figure 1B-e) and then a standard cover glass of 12 mm (Figure 1B-f). Secure these with a retaining ring (Figure 1B-g) in the back-chamber area.\n\tNOTE: The filler glass prevents space to open between the fascia and the window at the front side, which is used for imaging.\nHydrate the window view area in which the tumor will be inserted by filling a 1 mL syringe with sterile 0.9% NaCl. Allow a few drops to fall on this view area. Remove excess saline with a sterile cotton tip.\nIn the fascia, create a pocket large enough to hold the 1 mm3 tumor fragment (Figure 1A-a) using a 25 G needle with its tip is bent at a 90° angle (Figure 1A-d). Using a needle holder or Kelly forceps, insert the tumor fragment in the middle of the transplantable window view area in this pocket.\nClose the window view area with a standard cover glass of 12 mm and a retaining ring.\n\tNOTE: An air bubble can form, but it will disappear within hours.\n4. Pre- and After-care of the Animal\nAdminister drugs for pain relief (i.e., 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine) subcutaneously as approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Allow the mouse to recover from anesthesia under a heating lamp.",
    "Place window-bearing mice individually in a cage and in a climate-controlled room set to 32 °C and above 50% humidity. Make sure that the water bottles are at environmental temperature before placing them on the cage to prevent leakage. Use cages and enrichment that allow unobstructed movement and access to food and water.\n\tNOTE: As this window chamber is very well tolerated, mice show normal behavior. Individual housing prevents damage to the window chamber caused by other mice, and the high temperature/humidity prevents the cooling down and dehydration of the skinfold.\nCheck the mouse regularly for chewed-off sutures, loose bolts/nuts, or broken cover glass. Immediately repair and replace when this happens. A cover made of light material may be used to protect the window.\n5. Intravital Imaging\nNOTE: In this procedure, a multiphoton microscope and the appropriate control software are used. Here, software packages that were provided with the microscopes are used. In principal, any software package that comes with a microscope and is meant for microscope control and for the capture of images will suite this purpose.\nSwitch on the system: PC/microscope, power to confocal control unit, laser power, and laser emission. For example, with this software, start the software and initialize the microscope table (Figure 1E-a and 1E-c) by clicking \"initialize table.\" Switch on the system and set it to the mode enabling the PC to control the microscope, xy-table, z-positioning, and image capture.\nSwitch on the fluorescent light (Figure 1E-b).\n\tNOTE: This is used to evaluate fluorescence images through the ocular together with bright field.\nSwitch on the custom-made, temperature-controlled platform (Figure 1C-c; described in the Discussion in more detail) set at 37 °C.",
    "Switch on the anesthesia unit using isoflurane/O2 (Figure 1E-d). Mount the anesthesia tube on the microscope stage (Figure 1C-e). Install a clamp on the xy-stage to fix the anesthesia snout piece.\nPre-evaluate the animal to establish the stage of tumor vessel development; this depends on the speed of tumor growth, but it can vary between individual mice.\nSedate the mouse using inhalation anesthetics (isoflurane/O2) in an anesthesia chamber (see step 2.6).\nPlace the animal on the temperature-controlled platform mounted on the microscope stage; this prevents the cooling down of the animal when it is anesthetized. Make sure the snout of the mouse is located in the anesthesia cone and apply eye ointment if the evaluation will take longer than 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: For an evaluation longer than 1 h, reduce the isoflurane flow to 2%.\nUse the chamber bolts to fix (Figure 1C-b, full arrow) the chamber on a custom-made chamber holder (Figure 1C-a). Screw this holder (Figure 1C-d, dashed arrow) to the heated platform (Figure 1C-c).\n\t\tNOTE: This combination prevents movement artifacts in the window view area while still allowing the animal to breathe freely.\nMake sure to clean the glass of the window view area with a cotton tip dipped in water to prevent a blurry image and interference coming from debris on the outside of the glass. Place the platform and mouse on the microscope stage (Figure 1D).\n\t\tNOTE: Take care that the tail does not get stuck between the platform and the microscope stage.\nVisually check the stage of tumor vessel development using a 10X objective lens, bright-field, and fluorescent light.",
    "NOTE: Fluorescent vessels should be in focus and the blood flow should be visible using bright field. When the vasculature is clearly seen, evaluate the stage of tumor vessel development. For instance, determine whether there is early-onset angiogenesis with the growth of tip cells or an already-established vasculature for drug delivery. The same animal can be evaluated again, and as tumor development is a continuous process. Several stages can be observed in a single tumor at the same time.\n\t\t\nWhen it is not possible to focus on the vasculature, remove the animal from the stage, let the mouse recover, and place the animal back in a climate-controlled space. Check it again later. When the mouse is ready for evaluation, continue with the process described below.\nSwitch on the confocal lasers and the control panel by clicking \"Laser\" and \"Ctrl panel\" in the Configuration tab\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to set the laser power low, particularly for the Argon laser, to prevent bleaching, the heating of the tissue, and photodamage. The control panel can be set to personal preferences. For intravital imaging using multiple fluorophores it is recommended to apply the following settings: \"smart gain, 100 V per turn,\" \"smart offset, 10% per turn,\" \"zoom, medium,\" \"X position, medium,\" \"Y position, medium,\"and \"Z position, 100 µm per turn.\" Prior to imaging, adjust the offset to minimize the noise and optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. The confocal zoom function allows for a higher magnification without changing the objective lenses. X, Y, and Z control is necessary to locate the fields of interest. For intravital microscopy, Z-positioning should be about 100 µm per turn as tick tissue is evaluated.",
    "Click on \"Acquisition\" in the Acquire tab and change the setting to: \"Acquisition mode XYZ or XYZT,\" \"Format (512x512 or 1024x1024),\" and \"Speed (400 Hz or 200 Hz).\" Click on \"Pinhole\" and set it to 1 airy unit. Click on \"Bidirectional X\".\n\tNOTE: To optimize the images, a balance between laser power, gain, and pinhole should be struck, which is mentioned in the Discussion.\nWhen evaluating multiple fluorophores, select “Sequential scan” and “Between frames” to prevent bleed-through, which is mentioned in the Discussion.  Choose “Line Average 4” to obtain a good reduction of the noise.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the intrinsic fluorescence present in the transgenic animal, other fluorescent markers, like dextrans, Hoechst, FITC-BSA, fluorescent chemotherapeutics, and/or nanoparticles diluted to the desired concentration in 0.9% NaCl can be administered and assessed in the tumor. These are injected through the tail or penile vein.\nClick on \"Experiment\" in the Acquire tab and select \"New\" to make a new data base.\nEvaluate the animal using, depending on the research question, 10X, 20X, or 40X objective lenses. Through the ocular, find a position to evaluate.\n\tNOTE: It is best to use dry lenses with an NA as high as possible, as dry lenses have a relatively long working distance and do not need immersion fluid. In the Discussion, the use of water-immersion objective lenses is mentioned.\nUse a fast live scan to find the proper gain and offset to prevent overexposure and to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. Also, maintain same imaging settings during and between experiments if quantitative comparison is needed.\n\tNOTE: Further considerations for optimal imaging are mentioned in the Discussion. The XYZ position and zoom can be finalized during the live scan using the control panel.",
    "To make a Z-stack, select \"Z-stack\" in the Acquire tab. Make a fast Z-scan using the Z-position in the control panel and set the beginning and end of the scan by clicking \"Begin µm\" and \"End µm.\" Set the Z-step size related to the pinhole size.\nCapture the images by clicking \"start.\"\n\tNOTE: As intravital microscopy is all about kinetics and therefore dynamic processes are observed, a compromise between the time needed to acquire an image and the speed of the biological processes must be made. In general, the higher the resolution, the more fluorescent channels are scanned and the bigger the scanning field, the more pixels per image. Thicker Z-stacks translate to a longer imaging time. A longer imaging time increases the chance of movement artifacts and may cause damage to the tissue imaged. Also, be aware that scanning certain fluorescent labels causes bleaching and toxicity, which is affected by laser power and the concentration of the accumulated dye.\nAfter scanning the Z-stack can be quickly evaluated by clicking “maximal projection”. The Z-stack is automatically saved in the data base and can be renamed.\n6. Data Analysis\nDepending on the original research question, use one of several software programs, such as ImageJ5, Matlab11, or Amira, for data analysis. Correct analysis is crucial."
