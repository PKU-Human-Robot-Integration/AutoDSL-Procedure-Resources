    "Cloning of Nematostella vectensis Hsp70 isoforms into yeast expression plasmidsThere are three Nematostella vectensis Hsp70 cytosolic isoforms; NvHsp70A, NvHsp70B, NvHsp70D.We assembled the open reading frame from each Hsp70 (A, B, D) using sequence resources available through Nematostella JGI genome portal (https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/[href=https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/]).NvHsp70A, B, and D were amplified from cDNA synthesized from RNA isolated from Nematostella vectensis originating from Massachusetts coast. The published protocol for Q5® High-Fidelity 2x Master Mix (https://www.neb.com/protocols[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols]) was used with an annealing temperature of 60 °C and extension time of 1 min. The following primers were used (Table 1):Table 1. Primer sequences used for cloning NvHsp70 isoformsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190925/20190925232118_7680.jpgInfusion cloning was used to integrate PCR products into yeast expression plasmid pAG415GPD-ccdB vectorThe main yeast cytosolic Hsp70, Ssa1 was used as a control.All inserts were sequence confirmed with Sanger sequencing.Ssa1-4∆ yeast strain S. cerevisiae contains four isoforms of cytosolic Hsp70 (Ssa1-4), at least one of the isoforms is required in order to remain viable. The ssa1∆ ssa2∆ ssa3∆ ssa4∆ (ssa1-4∆) pYCPlac33-SSA1 strain was generated using the loxP-kanMX-loxP gene disruption cassette. In order to keep the ssa1-4∆ strain, a plasmid-borne pYCPlac33-SSA1 (URA3) is needed. For more strain details, please see (Jaiswal et al., 2011).Transformation of Hsp70 expression plasmids into ssa1-4∆ yeast cellsInoculate 1 colony in 10 ml of YPD (See Recipes) and incubate in a shaker overnight at 30 °C. The following morning, inoculate 100 ml of YPD with the 10 ml overnight culture and incubate at 30 °C (shaking at 220 rpm) until an OD600nm of 0.5 is achieved. Harvest the culture in a sterile 50 ml centrifuge tube at 3,000 x g for 5 min.Pour off medium, re-suspend the cells in 25 ml of sterile H2O and centrifuge again.Pour off the H2O, re-suspend the cells in 1.",
    "0 ml of 100 mM LiAc and transfer the suspension to a sterile 1.5 ml microfuge tube.Pellet the cells at top speed for 5 s and remove the LiAc with a micropipette.Re-suspend the cells to a final volume of 500 μl which is about 400 μl of 100 mM LiAc.Boil a 1.0 ml sample of single stranded carrier DNA for 5 min and quickly chill in ice water.Vortex the cell suspension and pipette 50 μl samples into labeled microfuge tubes. Pellet the cells and remove the LiAc with a micropipette.The basic “transformation mix” consists of the following ingredients; carefully add them in order listed:240 μl of PEG (50%w/v)36 μl of 1.0 M LiAc25 μl of single stranded carrier DNA (2.0 mg/ml)50 μl of H2O and cloned NvHsp70 plasmid DNA (0.1-10 μg)Vortex each tube vigorously until the cell pellet has been completely mixed. This usually takes about one minute.Incubate the cell suspension for 30 min at 30 °C shaking at 220 rpm.Heat shock the cell suspension for 20-25 min in a water bath at 42 °C.Incubate on ice for 2 min.Microfuge at 5,000 x g for 15 s and remove the transformation mix with a micropipette.Pipette 0.2-1.0 ml of sterile H2O into each tube and re-suspend the pellet by pipetting it up and down gently.Screening the positive yeast colonies on selective mediaWarm and dry appropriate plates in a 30 °C incubator for at least 30 min prior to plating cells.After transformation, spread the yeast cells on synthetic dropout media (SD, Recipe 2) supplemented with the appropriate nutrients to select for plasmids and incubate at 30 °C for 2 days.Streak the colonies to fresh SD plates and incubate at 30 °C for at least 1 day.",
    "Streak yeast cells from previous to SD media containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA, Recipe 3) to counter-select for the URA3-based covering vector. If the mutated or non-native Hsp70 is insufficient to keep the cells alive as the sole isoform, the cells will not grow on plates containing 5-FOA.At this point, cells may be re-streaked and kept on YPD media. It is not required to keep them on SD-Leu as the Hsp70 plasmid is essential for viability.Testing functionality of Hsp70 under different treatmentsIf the non-native Hsp70 is able to provide essential function as the sole Hsp70 isoform of the cell at normal conditions (30 °C), we can further characterize the functionality of Hsp70 by observing the cellular resistance to different stressors including heat stress (37 °C), DNA damage (Hydroxyurea), Oxidative stress (H2O2), NaCl (osmotic stress), UV radiation, and CdCl2 and CuCl2 (heavy metal exposure).Ssa1-4∆ cells expressing NvHsp70 isoforms as their sole cytosolic Hsp70 are grown to mid-logarithmic phase (OD600nm = 0.5) in 10 ml of YPDA in a 50 ml tube.Dilute cells 10-fold serially (full concentration, 1/10 concentration, 1/100 concentration, and 1/1,000 concentration) in a clear 96-well plate.Cells are replica plated onto solid YPDA media containing the aforementioned chemicals or normal YPDA media and then exposed to abiotic stressors including heat stress at 37 °C and UV radiation (150 Jm-2, 200 Jm-2).Concentration of drugs used are as follows; HU (200 mM and 300 mM), MMS (0.04%, 0.08%), NaCl (0.8 M,1 M), CdCl2 (30 mM, 45 mM), CuCl2 (3 mM, 4 mM, 5 mM), H2O2 (0.8 mM, 1 mM).After cells have dried, all plates (except for the 37 °C plate) are kept upside-down in a 30 °C incubator for 3 days.",
    "A control plate of cells replica plates on normal YPDA (kept at 30 °C) should be used to compare the “normal growth rate” of the non-native isoforms in yeast to that on the chemical plates, see Figure 1. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190925/20190925232346_9037.jpgFigure 1. Expressing NvHsp70 in yeast (Waller et al., 2018). NvHsp70 isoforms provide essential Hsp70 function in yeast. Ssa1–4∆ cells were transformed with control plasmid pAG415-ccDB, Ssa1-expressing, or NvHSP70 isoform-expressing plasmids and then serially diluted onto media lacking leucine or containing 5-FOA. Growth of cells on 5-FOA demonstrates the ability of NvHSP70 isoforms to provide essential function when expressed as the sole Hsp70 in the cell. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C and then photographed."
