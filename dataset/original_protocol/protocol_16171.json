    "For scaled MSC-EV production, MSCs derived from bone marrow aspirates of healthy individuals are raised in 4-layered tissue culture stacks in human platelet lysate (hPL)−supplemented cultivation medium. During the expansion process, CM is harvested every 48 hr in a cumulative manner. Of note, to obtain optimal cell expansion required for optimal MSC-EV yield, we do not remove the EVs from the hPL-supplemented cultivation medium.\nNOTE: All steps should be performed under sterile conditions.\nMaterials\nMesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs; see appropriate articles in Current Protocols in Stem Cell Biology)\nCultivation medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-rec-0001])\n1× trypsin/EDTA solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-rec-0005]) or other suitable enzymatic detachment reagent\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Gibco, cat. no. 70013-016)\n0.4% trypan blue (Sigma, cat. no.

Seed MSCs at a density of around 800 to 1500 MSCs/cm2 in a 4-layered tissue culture stack containing 400 ml cultivation medium. Document the number of seeded cells.\nProliferating MSCs, independent of their origin (including bone marrow, adipose tissue, perinatal tissue), should be raised in serum, or, if xeno-free settings are intended, in hPL-supplemented medium (10%). Because of their low protein content, which is not compatible with the PEG precipitation, chemically defined media are not applicable.\n2. Examine the confluence of the cells with a microscope daily.\nDetermine the approximate confluence of the cells; train participating co-workers to reach comparable outcomes.\n3. Change medium when cells have reached ∼50% confluency.",
    "Discard the first harvest of CM. Because of low cell number, it contains only a low number of EVs.\n4. Collect the CM every 48 hr from MSCs showing 50% to 90% confluency.\nMSCs normally need to be split once a week before reaching 100% confluency. Typically, collection of CM can be performed up to two times before each split.\n5. For passaging, detach MSCs with suitable enzymatic detachment reagents and harvest the cells. For example, use 150 ml of 1× trypsin/EDTA for 5 min, at 37°C. Stop reaction by adding an equal volume of fresh cultivation medium; transfer to a 500-ml centrifugation tube, and spin down for 5 min at 900 × g.\nTo save conditioned medium for use in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-prot-0002], do not stop the enzymatic reaction with CM. No enzymes should reside in the CM being used for the EV isolation, so it is critical to only use fresh cultivation medium prepared as in Reagents and Solutions for this step.\n6. Resuspend pelleted cells in an appropriate volume of cultivation medium or PBS and determine the number of viable cells by trypan blue staining in a Neubauer chamber (hemocytometer; see Current Protocols article: Phelan & May, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-bib-0024]).\n7. Calculate the cell equivalents from which the CM was harvested:\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/e5097796-9c42-4498-80ae-629386aa7894/cpsc128-math-0001.pngn(imgsrc:/cms/asset/4424f074-4eef-4101-b0c6-71c2dfaa0e9f/cpsc128-math-0002.png): cell number during medium harvest at a time point imgsrc:/cms/asset/dffc8b4b-41fb-45ab-846d-f961b6bc0e5e/cpsc128-math-0003.png; n0: number of originally seeded cells.\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/c5801ea5-dcc5-4400-8469-e3c0c77c5d29/cpsc128-math-0004.pngn1: cell number during passaging at time point t1.\nAs an example, if 2 × 106 cells were seeded on day 0, and 4 × 107 cells are harvested on day 8 with the cells in exponential growth, the cell equivalent of day 6 CM is calculated as follows:\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/d3f15ba1-fa7c-4b03-b52d-2626cb6f9058/cpsc128-math-0005.png\nThus, at day 6, the CM can be considered to contain EVs from ∼1.89 × 107 cell equivalents.\nPreparation of MSC-CM",
    "8. Transfer the collected MSC-CM to a new centrifuge tube.\nThe size of the centrifuge tubes should be chosen based on the amount of cell culture. For small scale (up to 150 ml CM), 50-ml tubes are sufficient. For larger volumes (>150 ml) bigger tubes (e.g., 500-ml centrifugation tubes) are mandatory.\n9. Centrifuge the CM 15 min at 2000 × g, 4°C.\n10. Transfer supernatant to sterile storage containers.\nThe pellet contains detached cells and larger debris and should be discarded; only use the supernatant.\nThe supernatant can be stored either in centrifuge tubes or empty medium bottles.\n11. Store CM at −20°C until further processing.\nSupernatants of CM can be stored for up to several months at −20°C; however, freezing and thawing cycles should be avoided.",
    "The protein content of the CM is critical; thus, only serum- or hPL-supplemented media should be used. CM is harvested in in a cumulative manner, and can be pooled after thawing.\n         \nConditioned medium (CM; Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-prot-0001])\n3.75 M NaCl (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-rec-0003])\n50% (w/v) PEG 6000 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-rec-0004])\n0.9% sodium chloride (B. Braun, cat. no. 151072)\nMedium or buffer of choice: e.g.,10 mM HEPES buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-rec-0002])\nMedium-speed centrifuge (e.g., Avanti J26XP with rotor JS-5.3, Beckman Coulter)\nRapid flow filter system (e.g., Nalgene, cat. no. 595-4520)\n500-ml centrifuge tubes (Corning, cat. no. 431123)\nPolycarbonate tubes for ultracentrifugation (Beckman Coulter cat. no. 355622)\nUltracentrifuge (e.g., L7-65 with rotor Ti45, Beckman Coulter)\t\nLow-retention tubes (Kisker, cat. no. G017)\n1. Thaw CM at 4°C or at room temperature.\n2. Transfer CM to centrifuge tubes and—depending on the rotor—centrifuge 45 min at a minimum of 6800 × g and maximum of 10,000 × g, 4°C.\nThe pellet contains larger debris and should be discarded; only use the supernatant.\nThe maximum g-force that rotors can tolerate varies among available rotors. Rotors should be used that can be spun at least at 6800 × g, and if possible at 10,000 × g.\n3. Perform a bottle-top filtration of the CM using 0.22-µm filters.\nDepending on the cultivation medium used, pores of the filters tend to clog.\n4. Add PEG 6000 and NaCl to the filtered CM to a final concentration of 10% or 75 mM, respectively:\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nCM [ml],50% PEG 6000 [ml],3.75 M NaCl [ml]\n10,2.56,0.26\n40,10.26,1.03\n100,25.64,2.56\n400,102.56,10.26\n1000,256.41,25.64\n2000,512.82,51.28\n4000,1025.64,102.56\n10000,2564.10,256.41\n5. Incubate the suspension for 8-16 hr at 4°C (overnight).\n6. Mix the suspension well before transferring to centrifuge tubes.\nTubes from the preparation of the CM in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-prot-0001] can be re-used if they were kept sterile.",
    "Over time, the suspension will form layers. After mixing, the suspension should appear homogenous.\n7. Centrifuge 30 min at 1500 × g, 4°C.\n8. Remove and discard the supernatant carefully using a pipette; keep the white pellet.\nThe supernatant should be removed from the pellet as completely as possible. With some exercise, residual supernatant also can be carefully rinsed off.\n9. Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml 0.9% NaCl until the pellet is completely dispersed.\nThe suspension should be clear and should show no PEG lumps.\n10. Transfer the suspension to ultracentrifuge tubes.\nUltracentrifuge tubes are available in different materials; we have experienced the best recoveries in polycarbonate tubes.\n11. To transfer residual material, rinse the centrifuge tubes from the PEG precipitation with 25 ml of 0.9% NaCl.\n12. Transfer each washing to the same ultracentrifuge tube as its original pellet.\n13. Add 0.9% NaCl to the tubes to a final volume of 65 ml. Close the tubes with their lids.\n14. Balance/tare tubes before loading tubes opposite to each other.\nFor high-speed centrifugation, tubes need to be balanced according to the manufacturer's instructions. We tolerate a maximum discrepancy of 0.01 g. For odd numbers, load an empty tube with water to an equivalent weight and use it to balance the rotor.\nMark the outer side of each tube on the lid to easily identify the pellets following centrifugation.\n15. Ultracentrifuge 130 min at 100,000 × g, 4°C.\nDeceleration must be set without the brake. Total running time will thus increase to around 140 min.\n16. Take the tubes out of the rotor and place on ice.\n17. Carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette, and discard it.",
    "Avoid contact between the pipette and the pellet on the wall of the tube, which may be difficult to see. The mark on the lid allows localization of the pellet in case it is invisible. All of the supernatant should be removed from the pellet. The final residual amount can be carefully rinsed off; to avoid losing material, hold the pellet-containing side of the ultracentrifuge tube upwards.\n18. Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of the medium or buffer of choice.\nWe resuspend the yield of the CM of 4 × 107 cells in 1 ml 10 mM HEPES buffer. For reproducibility, we recommend always resuspending the pellet in a defined volume per cell equivalent.\n19. Add half of the calculated amount of buffer to the ultracentrifuge tubes, rinse the walls, and resuspend the pellet for a minimum of 4 min.\nAvoid air bubble formation during resuspension. It is best to resuspend by repetitive pipetting, keeping the tip always in the liquid.\n20. Add buffer to the final volume.\n21. Store small aliquots of the EV preparation in appropriate containers at −80°C.\nWe have compared several commercially available tubes and currently store our samples in Kisker low-retention tubes. Other tubes can be used, but should be tested for their impact on particle recovery and EV characteristics after storage.\nExample results are shown in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-tbl-0001].\nTable 1.\n                Example Results for Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.128#cpsc128-prot-0002]\ntable:\n﻿Volume supernatant [ml]:,4300,Cell count:,6.45 × 108\n\"Complete medium (after 6800-10,000 × g centrifugation)\",\"Complete medium (after 6800-10,000 × g centrifugation)\",\"Complete medium (after 6800-10,000 × g centrifugation)\",\"Complete medium (after 6800-10,000 × g centrifugation)\"\nProtein concentration [ng/µl]: From BCA,5224.69,Protein total [mg]: From BCA,22466\nParticle concentration [per ml]: From NTA,2.0 × 109,Particle total: From NTA,8.6 × 1013\nParticle size [nm]: From NTA_Average Size (×50 Value),100.3,100.3,100.3\nEVs,EVs,EVs,EVs",
