    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPCR procedures\nTiming: 9 h\nThe WW-PCR implements retrieving an unknown DNA using the partial overlap among three WWPs. A WW-PCR comprises three consecutive nested amplification reactions. And parallel WW-PCRs involve permutations of the WWPs. This section details the principle and operations of WW-PCR.\nFigure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] presents the rationale and process of WW-PCR. For convenience and clarity, only employ the permutation WWP1-WWP2-WWP3 to illustrate WW-PCR.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2374-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of wristwatch PCR\nGSP1, GSP2, and GSP3: gene-specific primers for primary, secondary, and tertiary PCRs, respectively; WWP1, WWP2, and WWP3: wristwatch primers for primary, secondary, and tertiary PCRs, respectively; thin solid line: known sequence; thin dotted line: unknown sequence; colorful thick line: primer complement; HSC: high-stringency cycle; LSC: low-stringency cycle; and RSC: reduced-stringency cycle. Only WWP permutation WWP1-WWP2-WWP3 is presented here to illustrate wristwatch PCR.
