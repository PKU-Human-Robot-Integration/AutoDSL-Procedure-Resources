    "1. Day 1: Cell and Reagent Preparation\nNOTE: All cell and reagent preparation should be performed in a biological safety cabinet to prevent contamination of samples.\nWarm filtered Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin in a 37 °C water bath.\nPrepare neonatal human dermal fibroblast (HDFn) media by supplementing warmed DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine.\nThaw a vial of frozen HDFns and centrifuge for 8 min at 200 x g to remove cryopreservation medium. Resuspend cells in prepared HDFn media at a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL and seed into a T-75 culture flask.\nPlace flask in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) to allow cell proliferation.\nStore HDFn media at 4 °C.\nPrepare pro- and anti-migratory reagents as needed.\n2. Day 3: Spheroid Preparation\nPerform the following in a culture hood to prevent contamination of samples.\nWhen cells reach 80% confluency, aspirate media and add 5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA. Store flask in a 37 °C incubator for 5 min to fully detach cells from the flask surface.\nAdd 5 mL of warmed media to the flask to neutralize the trypsin.\nIn a microcentrifuge tube, mix 10 μL of Trypan Blue and 10 μL of the cell suspension.\nCentrifuge the original cell suspension for 8 min at 200 x g.\nWhile the cell suspension is being centrifuged, add 10 μL of the Trypan Blue cell suspension to a hemocytometer and perform a cell count.\nFollowing centrifugation, aspirate media without dislodging the cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet at a concentration of 1.25 x 105 cells/mL.\nAdd 5 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the bottom of a 10 cm Petri dish to maintain a hydrated environment during spheroid growth.",
    "Invert the lid of the Petri dish. Add several 20 μL drops of the cell suspension onto the inner surface of the Petri dish lid.\nQuickly invert the lid again and place it back on the bottom of the dish, being careful not to dislodge the hanging drops. Figure 1 illustrates successfully formed hanging drops.\nCarefully place the dish in a 37 °C incubator and allow spheroids to grow in a hanging drop culture for a period of 72 h.\n3. Day 6: Embedding Spheroids into 3D Matrix\nPerform the following in a culture hood to prevent contamination of samples.\nFor the formation of first fibrin layer, create a clot solution of sufficient volume to add 100 μL of clot solution per well for as many wells as required (1 spheroid per well). Clots are comprised of 10% 10X HEPES buffer by volume (250 mM HEPES, 1500 mM NaCl, 50 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4), 2 mg/mL human fibrinogen, and 0.1 U/mL human alpha thrombin. The remainder of the clot volume is comprised of ultrapure water.\nAdd thrombin last and quickly add solution to desired wells in a 48-well plate in order to prevent clots from polymerizing prior to being added to wells.\nGently shake/tap well plate to ensure that fibrin clot mixture is coating the entire well, and then place well plate in the incubator for 1 h to allow the bottom clot layer to polymerize. Do not shake well plate hard enough to induce bubble formation; simply rock plate as necessary until the entirety of the well is coated. If larger clot volumes are used, this step may not be necessary.\nTransfer spheroids to the fibrin layer.",
    "Remove the well plate and the Petri dish containing spheroids in the hanging drop culture from the incubator and examine spheroids under a microscope. Then place the dish into the culture hood.\nCarefully invert the lid of the Petri dish to allow access to the hanging drop cultures.\nUsing a 21 G needle attached to a 1 mL syringe, carefully transfer one drop from the inverted lid into the center of each well, taking care not to puncture the polymerized fibrin layer coating the bottom of the well. To effectively transfer the drop, slowly pull the drop into the needle. Stop pulling the plunger back as soon as the entire drop is inside the needle; pulling the drop back too far may introduce air bubbles, which can disrupt effective spheroid transfer or subsequent imaging.\nExamine the well plate under a microscope to ensure that spheroids have properly transferred into all desired wells.\nFor the formation of second fibrin layer, create another clot solution using the same preparation as above for creation of the first fibrin layer (step 3.2). Carefully pipette 100 μL onto each spheroid-containing drop and examine under a microscope again to ensure that spheroids are still intact and have not been pushed to the edges of the wells.\nReturn the well plate to the incubator and allow the second layer to polymerize for 1 h.\n4. Day 6: Addition of Pro-migratory or Inhibitory Factors\nWarm HDFn media to 37 °C.\nPerform the following steps in a hood to prevent contamination.\nPrepare media for each group including appropriate concentrations of pro/anti-migratory agents to be evaluated.\nRemove the well plate from incubator and place in a culture hood.",
    "Add 500 μL of standard media to each well of the control spheroid group, 500 μL of inhibitory media to each well of the migration-inhibited spheroid group, and 500 μL of pro-migratory media to each well of the migration-enhanced spheroid group.\nReturn the well plate to the incubator.\nChange media every 48 h.\n5. Days 6-9: Evaluation of Cell Migration and Proliferation\nImage spheroids using brightfield microscopy immediately after addition of media (0 h) and then every 24 h for 72 h. Optional: at each time point, take a z-stack image in order to determine if migration is occurring in planes outside of the primary area of focus. In our experience this does not occur; however, it is useful to ensure this is the case in every experiment.\nUse ImageJ to determine cell outgrowth in each well by analyzing percent increase in area for each spheroid by tracing the cell border for each spheroid at each successive time point and using the \"Measure\" function to obtain the area.\nSubscription Required.
