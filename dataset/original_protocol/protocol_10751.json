    "1. Creating a Scotch-tape Master5\nDraw or print out desired microchannel layout, to scale, on paper. In our case the design consists of two Y-shaped channels, each 3 mm wide (Figure 2).\nCover a glass-slide with layers of scotch tape. The number of layers will determine the height of the channel (about 60 μm per layer). We used 3 scotch tape layers.\nPlace the layout design on a flat surface. Align the slide over the design pattern. Carefully cut the tape on the glass slide with a scalpel according to the layout.\nRemove the Scotch tape from all regions of the glass slide except those in the layout of the microchannel.\nPlace the slide in a heating oven at 65 °C for 2-3 min. Clean gently with ethanol.\n2. Fabricating a PDMS Microfluidic Device\nMix the base and curing components of PDMS as recommended by the manufacturer. We use a 10:1 ratio of base to curing agent. Pour about 30 ml of PDMS mixture into a Petri dish to a height of ~0.5 cm. Degas the PDMS in vacuum if needed. Submerge the glass slide in the PDMS with the patterned Scotch tape facing up. Placing the pattern after the PDMS prevents formation of air bubbles between the slide and dish bottom. Cure for 48 hr at 65 °C, making sure the dish is horizontal using a bubble level.\nIn a new 90 mm Petri dish pour 3 ml of PDMS mix, resulting in a layer about 0.5 mm deep. (If a spin coater is available, it can be used for this stage).\nDegas and cure as in 2.1.\nGently cut out the microfluidic device to the desired size with a scalpel. This layer will be termed the \"flow layer\".",
    "Cut out a similarly sized piece of thin layer PDMS from the second Petri dish. This will be termed the \"wells layer\".\nUse an appropriately sized biopsy puncher (We use 1.2 mm ID) to punch holes for the inlets and outlets in the flow layer.\nPlace the wells layer on a thick glass slide over the design layout and punch out wells, using 2 mm ID biopsy puncher, in alignment with the microchannels on the layout.\nClean both PDMS layers as well as a 24 mm x 60 mm glass coverslip with ethanol. Air-dry and keep clean.\nPlasma treat both the glass coverslip and the wells layer PDMS using either standard plasma etcher (for non-reversible bonding) or a hand-held corona treater6 for reversible bonding. Carefully place the wells layer on top of the coverslip to cause adhesion (Figure 3). Gently rub out any air bubbles (if needed).\n3. Cell Imaging Experiment\nMake sure you have the desired media ready in appropriate syringes connected to flexible plastic tubes with internal diameter of 0.02\" (Tygon) in the syringe pump.\nGrow S. cerevisiae strains to the desired phase in liquid YPD. Vortex thoroughly and place 300 μl of each strain into a microcentrifuge tube.\nGently place 1 μl of Concanavalin A (sigma) 2 mg/ml into each well. Wash out excess Concanavalin A from each well twice by gently pipetting water.\nWhile the Concanavalin A is drying, wash strains twice with 300 μl of SC medium lacking glucose. Washing residual glucose from the cell walls helps proper adherence to the Concanavalin A.",
    "Vortex cells thoroughly. Pipette 0.75 μl or less of each cell suspension into its own well (Figure 3). Gently wash out residual cells with rich medium. The next two steps need to be performed quickly in order to prevent cells from drying up.\nPlasma treat the chip and the wells thoroughly using the hand-held corona treater, being careful not to hit the wells directly. Carefully place the chip on the wells, paying close attention to the alignment between the two (this step can be done under a stereoscope). Gently press to adhere the two layers of PDMS. Slowly fill the device completely with about 50 μl rich medium, making sure no air bubbles are left inside the channel.\nConnect the device, inserting the tubes into the appropriate inlets and start media flow. Take care that no air bubbles are introduced into the device as these can be tricky to remove; this can be accomplished by disconnecting an inlet or outlet and gently tapping on the device where the bubbles are, being careful not to break the glass coverslip.\nPlace under microscope and find appropriate imaging points in each well.\nKeep the cells under rich medium flow for 1 hr or longer to allow recovery if needed.\nStart the experiment: we use constant flow from each of the two syringe pumps to prevent backflow of the media, changing relative flow rates as desired. Setting pump A to 0.8 ml/hr and pump B to 0.2 ml/hr results in medium A flowing over 80% of the width of the channel (Figure 4). This can be dynamically changed by changing the two flow rates. The new conditions stabilize within seconds along the full length of the channel2.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
