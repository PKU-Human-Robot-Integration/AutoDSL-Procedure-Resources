    "All procedures described were done in compliance with the laws and codes approved in the seventh title of the Regulation of the General Health Law Regarding Health Research of the Mexican Government (NOM-062-ZOO-1999) and in accordance with the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and were approved by the institutional committee of bioethics in research of the Universidad de Guanajuato and Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla.\n1. Microscope settings\nSwitch on the microscopy system.\nTurn on the pulsed laser to guarantee that it will be ready to lase at an optimal and steady power level after the sample extraction and preparation.\nTune the laser to 810 nm. To study tissular microtubules, 10%-20% of the available laser power is used, which, in the described system, corresponds to 13-26 mW measured at the back focal plane of the objective.\nMake sure the microscope is Köhler-aligned (Supplementary File 1), with the objective that will be used for the SHG imaging.\n\tNOTE: This is important since, in the commercial setup used in this work, the detection is performed in transmission mode and through the condenser.\nRemove unwanted filters from the optical detection path (Figure 1A).\nMake sure the condenser diaphragm is fully opened to ensure that no light is unnecessarily stopped at this level.\nPrepare a 25x/0.8 numerical aperture (NA) oil-immersion objective with a small drop of immersion oil in the lens.\n\t​NOTE: This objective was used to best match the condenser NA, which was 0.55 (ideally, NAcond≥ NAobj).\n2. Microscope preliminary controls\nNOTE: Perform the preliminary microscope controls once, unless the setup is modified.",
    "Image dry corn starch sandwiched between glass slides with SHG parameters to generate SHG images that reveal the laser polarization direction. Follow the steps reported in Supplementary File 2, except for the laser power, which is less than 5% for corn starch.\nTake one image of sparse corn starch grains, and mark the orientation of the SHG lobules in the x-y plane. This orientation corresponds to the laser orientation (Figure 2A).\nAs a control, take another image of the same sample, inserting into the optical path a half-wave plate (position shown in Figure 1A) to alter the oscillation direction of the laser. The resulting image displays rotated SHG signal lobules (Figure 2B, C).\nIf using a different type of bandpass filter for the SHG, make sure it has optimal transmission properties by comparing the images (Figure 2D, E) and the signal intensities pixel by pixel along a line-scan (Figure 2F).\n3. Tissue extraction\nNOTE: Always use clean tools to perform the surgical procedures.\nUse 6-12 month old taiep rats and age-matched Sprague-Dawley controls (WT).\nAnesthetize the animals with an i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamine-xylazine (0.125 mg/Kg and 5 mg/Kg) diluted in a 0.9% sterile NaCl solution.\n\t\nCheck the pain reflexes, and proceed only if they are absent.\nSacrifice the animal via decapitation.\nOnce the head is isolated, open the bones of the cranial vault carefully along the midline, starting from the most caudal point at the top toward the nose, from the orbital cavities toward the midline, and then from the most caudal point to below the brain and cerebellum.\n\tNOTE: Bone cutters and Rongeurs allow for proper removal of the head bones without damaging the brain structures.",
    "Release the brain and cerebellum from the bone. The two hemispheres could be separated. If the hemispheres are divided, use one half for SHG imaging, and fix the other half in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min inside a chemical hood for subsequent sectioning and staining.\n4. Vibratome sectioning\nPrepare a vibratome buffer tray filled with warm (37 °C) Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).\nFix the brain to the specimen plate using cyanoacrylate glue via a piece of masking tape. The most caudal portion/region contacts the glue so that the usable coronal sections from the opposite, rostral portion can be cut.\n\t\nAllow ~10 s for the glue to polymerize to obtain effective attachment of the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: The best results are obtained when the brain is oriented so that the blade cuts \"from top to bottom\" rather than \"from side to side\" (Figure 1B).\nTransfer the specimen plate onto its magnetic support inside the buffer tray.\nStart cutting 300-500 µm sections until the slices produced encompass the entire surface of the brain.\nAt this point, reduce the thickness of the section to 160 µm.\nOnce a complete 160 µm section is cut at the level of the corpus callosum, recover it with a modified glass Pasteur pipette with a large, flamed orifice (Figure 1C).\nTransfer it to a clean Petri dish with new warm HBSS or directly onto the glass support for microscopy (coverslip or glass-bottom dish).\n\t​NOTE: For the described experimental conditions, adding a coverslip above the sample is detrimental to the imaging.\n5. Transfer to the microscope\nIf the microscope is in a different room, prepare an insulated box with warmed gel packs to transfer the tissue sections while maintaining the temperature. The box also serves to keep the sections warm until they are imaged.",
    "Put the sample under the microscope, and make sure it is positioned properly under the objective by direct observation through the oculars with transmitted light.\n\tNOTE: The goal is to align the predicted emitting structures with the oscillation direction of the laser to maximize the emitted (and, therefore, detected) SHG signal.\nRemove the excess HBSS so that a thin liquid film covers the entire sample. Visually check the liquid film every few minutes to avoid excessive evaporation and drying of the sample.\n\tNOTE: In the conditions described, a section is used for no more than 20 min. Drying of the sample causes drastic artifactual effects (Supplementary Figure 1A). Rather than adding more HBSS, periodic soaking of the section in warm, fresh medium is recommended if longer imaging times are needed. The use of perfusion chambers and glue or low-melting agarose to immobilize the tissue is also recommended when longer experiments are to be done.\nPrepare the microscope stage for non-descanned imaging, which might include closing all the doors of the dark incubation chamber or covering the incubation chamber with a black nylon polyurethane-coated fabric.\n6. Imaging\nSelect the \"non-descanned\" imaging mode along the transmission path. This way, the capture of the weak SH signal of tubulin will be optimized.\nSelect the LCI Plan-Neofluar 25x/0.8 NA objective.\nSet a laser power between 13 mW and 26 mW, with a pixel dwell time of 12.6 µs. Take images no bigger than 512 pixels x 512 pixels, with speed 5 and averaging 2, for an average acquisition time of about 15 s.\n\tNOTE: Using higher laser powers and/or longer dwell times may damage the sample (Supplementary Figure 1B).",
    "Take images first using a 485 nm short-pass filter (SP485), and, in a second step, add a sharp 405 nm bandpass filter (BP405; Figure 3). Follow the steps reported in Supplementary File 2.\n\tNOTE: Pseudo-brightfield images can be taken through the same detector using the residual laser light of a visible line (405 nm or 488 nm lasers work best).\n7. Processing of the cerebellum\nFirst, cut the cerebellum with a scalpel into two hemispheres, and then glue them to the vibratome support by the middle portion (the flat part obtained after cutting).\nSection and image the cerebellum in the same way as was described for the brain (160 µm sections, same vibratome settings, same blade, same microscope settings, etc.).\n\tNOTE: Due to the anatomy of the cerebellum, its orientation at the moment of sectioning is not critical; in most of the slices generated away from the surface, there will be folia sectioned well into the white matter.\nSubscription Required.
