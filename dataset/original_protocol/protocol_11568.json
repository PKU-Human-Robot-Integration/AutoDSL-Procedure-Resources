    "NOTE: Some steps in this protocol can be accomplished using custom software provided (along with installation instructions) at http://groups.upb.de/viat/TVATOJ. In the protocol, this collection of programs and scripts is referred to as “TVATOJ”.\n1. Selection of Stimulus Material\nSelect stimuli according to the research question.\n\tNOTE: In general, two targets are shown at different locations on the screen. Stimuli that have been used with the present method include, for example, shapes, digits, letters, singletons in pop-out displays, and objects in natural images. The latter three types were used in this protocol.\n\tNOTE: Several different stimulus types are included in the TOJ plugin (\"psylab_toj_stimulus\" provided with TVATOJ) for the experiment builder OpenSesame12.\nWhen creating new stimulus types, make sure that the properties of interest have to be encoded for the judgment by making them important for the task or select stimuli where the properties of interest are encoded automatically (e.g., singletons in pop-out displays).\n2. Power Estimation and Planning\nPerform a Bayesian power analysis by simulating data sets with the selected model, planned design (SOA distribution and repetitions), sample sizes, and hypothesized parameters. Estimate whether it is likely to reach the research goal (for instance, a certain difference in the parameters). If the power is not sufficient, alter the design by adding or shifting SOAs or repetitions and repeat the analysis.\nTo use the provided TVATOJ software, open and edit the script \"exp1-power.R\". Follow the comments in the file to adjust it for the specific analysis. For general information on Bayesian power estimation refer to Kruschke13.\n3. Specification or Programming of the Experiment\nUse an experiment builder or psychophysical presentation library to implement the experiment.\nTo use the OpenSesame TOJ plugin provided in TVATOJ, drag the \"psylab_toj_stimulus\" plugin into a trial presentation loop. Alternatively, open the \"simple-toj.osexp\" example experiment in OpenSesame.",
    "Select the desired stimulus type from the dropdown menu \"Stimulus type\" in the psylab_toj_stimulus configuration. Follow the instructions in TVATOJ for adding new stimulus types if required.\nSpecify the trials as described in the following steps.\nFor every experimental condition, create trials with the planned SOAs. When using the psylab_toj_stimulus plugin and OpenSesame, add all varied factors as variables to the trial loop (e.g. \"SOA\").\nAdd rows to the table to realize all factor combinations (e.g., seven SOAs, from -100 to 100 msec, crossed with the experimental conditions \"attention\" and \"neutral\"). Adjust the loop's \"Repeat\" attribute to create sufficient repetitions (see protocol step 2 for determining the distribution and repetition of SOAs).\n\t\tNOTE: Typically, at most 800 trials can be presented within one hour. If more repetitions are needed, consider splitting the experiment into several sessions. Make sure that the \"Order\" attribute of the loop is set to \"Random\" before running the experiment.\nIn the psylab_toj_stimulus plugin configuration, add placeholders (e.g. \"[SOA]\") for the varied factors in the respective fields. Enter constant values in the fields of factors that are not varied.\n\t\tNOTE: Before running the experiment, make sure that accurate timing is guaranteed. If appropriate timing behavior of newer monitors was not verified, use CRT monitors and synchronize with the vertical retrace signal12.\n4. Experimental Procedure\nWelcoming and briefing of the participants\nWelcome the participants and inform them about the general form of the experiment (computer-based perception experiment). Inform the participants about the prospective duration of the experiment. Obtain the participants' informed consent to participate in the experiment.\nEnsure that the participants show normal or corrected-to-normal vision (optimally by conducting short vision tests). Some deficits, such as color blindness, may be tolerable if they do not interfere with the research question for the particular type of stimulus material.",
    "Provide a quiet booth where the experiment is conducted. Adjust the chair, chin rest, keyboard position, and so on, to ensure optimal viewing and response conditions for the experiment.\nMake the participants aware that the experiment requires attention and mental focus and can be fatiguing. Ask them to take short breaks when required. It is, however, equally important not to perform these simple tasks under strong attentional strain. Tell the participants that it is okay to make some errors.\nInstruction and warm-up\nPresent onscreen instructions for the task, detailing the presentation sequence and response collection procedure. Inform the participants that the task is to report the order in which the targets arrived, and that this will be difficult in some trials. Ask the participants to report their first impression when they cannot tell the order for certain, and let them guess if they have no such impression at all.\n\t\tNOTE: In the binary TOJs used here, there is no option to indicate the perception of simultaneity. To avoid excessive guessing, do not point out the presence of trials with simultaneously presented targets explicitly. Let these simply be difficult trials with the instructions outlined above.\nTo avoid eye movements during the trials, ask participants to fixate a mark which is shown in the center of the screen. Ask them to rest their head on a chin rest.\nAsk the participants to take short breaks if necessary. Let them know when breaks are allowed and when they must be avoided (e.g., during the target presentation and before the response).\nInclude a short training in which participants can get used to the task. To this end, present a random subset of the experimental trials (see protocol step 3.2).",
    "NOTE: Because the task itself is rather simple, ten to twenty trials are usually sufficient. It can be advantageous to increase the participants' confidence in their performance in this task. This can be done by slowing down the presentation and providing feedback.\nObtain the participants' confirmation that they have understood the task (let them explain it) and that they have no further questions.\nRunning the main experiment\nLet the experimental software start with the presentation of the main trials. Leave the booth for the main experiment.\n5. Model-based Analysis of the TOJ Data\nConvert the raw data files into counts of \"probe first\" judgments for every SOA. For instance, run the script \"os2toj.py\" provided with TVATOJ.\nRun the Bayesian estimation procedure to estimate the main parameters wp and C, the derived ones vp and vr and the differences of the parameters. For this purpose, run the script \"run-evaluation.R\" after editing it according to the instructions provided in the file.\nWhen the sampling has finished, the differences of interest for the research questions can be assessed. Examples can be found in the following section.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
