    "The animal experiments were carried out under the principles of the regional committee (Ministerium für Energiewende, Landwirtschaft, Umwelt, Natur und Digitalisierung des Landes Schleswig-Holstein, permission number: V242-21249/2020 [38-4/20]). The mice used for the present study were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials). The animals were kept under standard conditions with a 12 h light, 12 h night cycle; water and food were offered ad libitum.\n1. Animal care\nHouse the mice in specialized cages with bedding, nesting material, a hiding place, and proper access to drinking water and food.\nKeep the animals under continuous specialized veterinary control and treatment.\n\tNOTE: For mice ordered by external suppliers, please assure 7 days of acclimation before starting the procedure.\n2. Preparation of the o-ring\nNOTE: An o-ring with a fixed diameter of 0.4 mm is recommended to induce cardiac hypertrophy after 2 weeks. The extent and severity of the cardiac phenotype induced depend on the size of the o-ring diameter.\nFirst, perform one cut of the o-ring (see Table of Materials) under the microscope using scissors or a scalpel to enable the placement around the aorta (Figure 1A, B).\nPierce each ring side close to the cut with a needle connected with an 8-0 non-absorbable suture and pull the thread. Cut and leave 2-3 cm on one side and 2 cm on the other side to fasten the o-ring around the aorta in the final step (Figure 1C, D).\nBefore surgery, take the ligation aid (species instrument, see Table of Materials) and pull the end of the thread (which is kept longer) of one ring side through the hole of the constriction (Figure 1E, F). Put the ligation aid with the attached o-ring aside for placement in the following step (step 6).",
    "For the disinfection of the ring with the threads, place the ring in an alcohol solution for half an hour. Afterward, lay it on cellulose to dry. Keep the dried ring in a closed tub or case until use. During the surgery, after pulling the thread through the ligation aid, place the ring on a clean surface until use.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64455/64455fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Performing the o-ring preparation for ligation.

Premedication of the mice and preparation of the operating field\nTo receive sufficient analgesia during the surgery, inject the analgesic buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, see Table of Materials) intraperitoneally 20 min before proceeding to the surgery.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, the pain medication was used following the recommendations of the Gesellschaft für Versuchstierkunde/Society of Laboratory Animal Science (GV-SOLAS).\nAfter premedication, anesthetize the mouse in an induction chamber with 2%-4% isoflurane mixed with 0.5-1.0 L/min of 100% O2.\nShave the fur on the left thorax side of the sedated mouse. After shaving, put the mouse back into the isoflurane-filled chamber and wait for sufficient sedation before intubating the animal.",
    "NOTE: The right time point of the sedation shows slow breathing but avoids snap breathing. Depending on the isoflurane gas setting, it takes 2-3 min to achieve the right level of sedation.\nTurn the heating pad on before the surgery to maintain the animal's body temperature (37 °C). Connect the heating pad to a rectal probe (see Table of Materials) to maintain the mouse's body temperature automatically.\n4. Intubation of the mice\nPrepare the required instruments (Figure 2A). Disinfect the laryngoscope before the surgery by placing it in alcohol for about 1-3 minutes and then keeping it for drying overnight.\nStretch a rubber band around the heating pad to fix the mouse with the front teeth on the plate. Place the sedated mouse on the heating pad in a supine position.\nPlace the rubber band over the animal's front teeth to extend the neck on the plate.\nFocus a light source on the throat for good visibility of the opening of the trachea for the endotracheal intubation (Figure 2B).\nOpen the mouth gently with one hand positioning an intubation aid (handmade laryngoscope, see Table of Materials) (Figure 2A[3]).\nWith the other hand and small forceps, gently move the tongue to clear the opening of the trachea.\nUse this hand also to introduce the endotracheal tube into the trachea. On the other hand, still hold the intubation aid. For intubation, use a 22 G cannula (see Table of Materials) (Figure 2A[1]).\nConnect the endotracheal tube position via a three-way stopcock to a ventilator (see Table of Materials) for mice to confirm the correct endotracheal tube position (endotracheal).\nMonitor the right ventilation according to the manufacturer's instructions (tidal volume of 200 µL and respiration rate between 100-150 breaths/min) (Figure 2C).",
    "Confirm sufficient anesthetic depth by a toe pinch reflex check (no reflex response).\nTurn the anesthesia setting to 2% isoflurane mixed with 0.5-1.0 L/min 100% O2.\nApply ophthalmic ointment on the eyes to avoid dryness during the surgery.\nUsing a cotton swab, disinfect the surgery area 3 times with a commercially available disinfectant solution (see Table of Materials).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64455/64455fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Intubation of the mouse.

Surgery and preparation for ring positioning\nNOTE: Use sterile materials and instruments to avoid infections.\nUse scissors to make a 0.5-1 cm long skin incision in the middle of a line between the xyphoid process and left axilla. Use forceps to separate the muscle layer from the underlying ribs and place two retractors (5 mm length, see Table of Materials) into the incision to expose the rib cage.\nTo start the left thoracotomy, perform a small incision (~1-2 mm) in the intercostal muscles between the second and third rib using micro spring scissors. Open the thoracic cavity and spread the incision with 45° angled forceps.\nPlace three chest retractors (1.0-2.5 mm length) into the incision for opening the thoracic cavity to improve visualization.\nTo expose the aortic arch, try to lift up and gently separate the thymus and fat tissue from the arch with fine tip 45° angled forceps.\n6. Ligation of the transverse aorta with the o-ring",
    "Expose the aortic arch with 45° angled forceps in one hand. Position, with the other hand, the o-ring connected with the ligation aid via the threads of one side (step 2).\nPass the threads using the ligation aid under the aortic arch from the caudal side to the cranial side of the transverse aorta between the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries (Figure 3A).\nTake both threads between the ligation aid and the aortic arch with the forceps carefully. Retract and remove the ligation aid and gently position the o-ring around the arch by pulling the threads on each side (Figure 3B).\nAfter successful positioning, fix the o-ring with the threads and a surgical knot. Make an additional one to avoid opening the knot on each side (Figure 3C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64455/64455fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Performing the o-ring implantation. (A) The aortic arch is exposed by three retractors of 1.0-2.5 mm. Both long threads of one ring side are passed under the aorta. (B) The o-ring will be placed by gently pushing the ring and pulling the threads. (C) The is o-ring is in the right position, and one cranial thread is knotted with caudal thread on each side.

Suture and post-operative recovery\nRemove the three chest retractors (2.5 mm length) from the incision.\nIf needed, eliminate the residual air from the thorax by filling it with a warm 0.9% isotonic salt solution.\nTo expose the thorax incision for suture, take two retractors (5 mm length) again to hold the skin on the side.\nClose the thorax with two or three 6-0 non-absorbable sutures (see Table of Materials) and pinch off the outflow of the ventilator for 2 s to reinflate the lungs.",
    "Remove the two retractors and close the skin with three to five 4-0- absorbable sutures.\nTurn off the isoflurane and monitor. When the animal starts self-breathing, the whiskers are moving, and the toe pinch reflexes can be triggered, extubate the mouse. Lay the mouse on the left side under the heat lamp in its care unit and observe it until it is completely awake.\nDo not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness.\n\tNOTE: An animal that has undergone surgery should get its own care unit (cage) for better recovery.\nPerform pain management with tramadol (1 mg/mL) in drinking water for 7 days and buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, 3x daily) by intraperitoneal injection for 3 days after surgery if needed.\n\tNOTE: Follow local animal ethics committee recommendations for postoperative analgesia.\nCheck medication by weighing the water bottles daily and watch the animal's behavior.\n8. Confirmation of successful constriction and right position of the ring\nOne day after surgery, verify the stenosis using ultrasound by measuring the maximal flow velocity over the stenosis.\nFor measurements, use echocardiography with an ultrasound system and a transducer probe with a frequency of 30 MHz (see Table of Materials).\nAs described above, maintain anesthesia using a mask at 1.5%-2% isoflurane with 0.5-1.0 L/min of 100% O2.\nPlace the anesthetized animal on the heating pad in a supine position. Connect the heating pad with a rectal probe to maintain the body temperature at 37 °C ± 1 °C, and monitor the heart rate with an ECG using four mouse paw sensors (see Table of Materials).\nFor better visualization, use depilation creme.",
    "A successfully performed ORAB results in an increased flow velocity over the stenosis as measured by ultrasound (~2,400 mm/s) (Figure 4C). For this measurement, position the transducer head parasternally on the right thorax side to localize the aortic arch by two-dimensional (2D) imaging (\"B-mode\").\n\t\nUse the color Doppler to visualize the blood flow in the aorta and measure with the pulsed wave Doppler blood flow velocity over the stenosis.\n\t\tNOTE: Sham-operated mice (control surgery without a constriction) show a blood flow velocity of ~600-900 mm/s. In addition, a successful ORAB also results in an increased velocity flow ratio between the right carotid (~150 mm/s) (RC, Figure 4A) and the left carotid (~300 mm/s) LC, Figure 4B) in the mouse.\nVisualize the right and left arteria carotis interna by two-dimensional (2D) imaging (B-mode). Position the transducer head horizontal on the left and right sides of the neck at a 45° angle and use the pulsed wave Doppler to determine the blood flow velocity.\n\tNOTE: In sham-operated mice, the velocity flow in both arteries is similar.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64455/64455fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Confirmation of transverse aorta ligation using pulse wave Doppler velocity measurement in the carotid arteries. (A) Representative pulsed wave Doppler velocity signals of the right carotid artery. (B) The stenosis results in a higher flow velocity in the right carotid artery than in the left. (C) The stenosis induced by constriction results in a flow velocity in the descending aorta of more than 2,400 mm/s. Sham mice show a flow velocity of 600-900 mm/s.
