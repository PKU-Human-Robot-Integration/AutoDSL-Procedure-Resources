    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThawing primary cells\nTiming: 30–45 min\nThis step describes a method to thaw a primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell sample that was in cryogenic storage. This will ensure that cell viability is maintained while preventing clumping of cells. If using a fresh sample, this step is not necessary.\nWarm primary cells that were stored in liquid nitrogen until completely thawed in a 37°C water bath. This thawing protocol has been successfully used on cell numbers ranging from 5–200 million total cells.\nTransfer cells to 15 mL tube.\nIntroduce 100 μL of DNase I (−20°C) dropwise to the cells that are still in freezing media. Gently agitate the tube to mix.\nIncubate the cells in 37°C for 90 s with the DNase.\nWhile gently rocking the 15 mL tube, slowly add 10 mL thawing media. Rocking the tube while adding media will help mix the AML cells with the media and decrease clumping of cells. Invert the tube to further mix.\nCentrifuge the cells at 580 × g for 7 min at 20°C.\nAspirate the media and add 70 μL of DNase to the pellet, resuspend by flicking the tube.\nWhile gently rocking the 15 mL tube, slowly add 10 mL thawing media. Invert the tube to mix.\nCentrifuge the cells at 580 × g for 7 min at 20°C.\nAspirate the media and add 50 μL of DNase to the pellet, resuspend by flicking the tube.\nWhile gently rocking the 15 mL tube, slowly add 10 mL thawing media. Invert the tube to mix.\nCentrifuge the cells at 580 × g for 7 min at 20°C.\nStaining\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step describes the methods to stain the cells in preparation for sorting using antibodies and dyes.",
    "Here we provide optimized antibody dilutions for approximately 50–200 million AML cells and the instrumentation we have worked with; however, it is important to titrate and optimize antibody concentrations for each instrument (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]). Data shown in this protocol was generated using a BD FACSAria. These dilutions likely provide a good starting point.\nAspirate remaining thawing media from the cell pellet.\nResuspend cells in 80 μL of FACS buffer. Distribute 5 μL for unstained and single antibody controls into six, 5 mL round bottom polypropylene tubes, transfer the remaining 50 μL of cell suspension into a 7th tube. If the AML specimen is limited the user may choose to use less cells for staining controls. In this case, the number of cells used for staining controls can be adjusted as needed.\nCount cells (the remaining protocol was optimized for 50–200 million cells). 1–10 μL of cells is often sufficient for cell counting. It should be noted that manual counting is recommended as AML specimens often contain heterogenous cell types which are not as accurately counted using some automated counting systems.\nAdd 45 μL of FACS buffer to each control tube so each tube contains 50 μL of total volume. Adjust volume of 7th tube with sample of interest to achieve cell concentration of 0.1–0.5 million cells/μL (ex. 50 million cells in no less than 100 μL of FACS buffer).\nAdd antibodies to the appropriate tubes shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Recommended starting dilutions for antibodies are CD45-FITC (1:20), CD3-PeCy7 (1:40), CD19-Pe (1:20) (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_349_1.csv\nIncubate the tubes for 20 min at 4°C.\nWash cells in 500 μL of FACS buffer and centrifuge at 580 × g for 5 min at 20°C.\nAspirate the FACS buffer and unbound antibodies from the cell pellet.",
    "Prepare a 5 μM working stock of CellROX in serum-free metabolomics media. Add 500 μL to 1 mL per tube. For control tubes use serum-free metabolomics media without CellROX. CellROX is a cell permeable fluorogenic probe that exhibits photostable fluorescence upon oxidation by ROS. Other ROS dyes can and have been be used including 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) (Lagadinou et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]); however, we normally observe better resolution of the low and high populations using CellROX.\nIncubate the tubes for 30 min at 37°C.\nCentrifuge the cells at 580 × g for 5 min at 20°C and aspirate the media.\nWash the sample and control tubes with 1 mL of FACS buffer and spin at 580 × g for 5 min.\nAspirate the remaining FACS buffer from the pellet and resuspend each tube in either FACS buffer or FACS-DAPI preparation according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nPass the cells through a cell strainer to ensure a single cell suspension. Count the cells and adjust the total volume to give a final cell concentration of 20 million cells/mL.\nTransfer all samples on ice to cell sorter or flow cytometry facility. This protocol has been successfully executed using a BD FACSAria and a Sony SH800S cell sorter; however, it should be applicable to other sorters with ability to excite around 644 nm and detect around 665 nm emission.\nGating and sorting\nTiming: 2+ h\nThis step describes the critical methods for sorting primary cells into ROS-low and ROS-high populations. These sorting methods will distinguish between functional AML LSCs (ROS low) and AML blasts (ROS high). These methods will also exclude lymphocytes which can sometimes appear in ROS-low populations. Gating strategy shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Representative ROS profiles are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/349-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Scheme for ROS-low LSCs and ROS-high AML blasts cell sorting and expected results\n(A) Flow scheme demonstrating ROS sorting to enrich ROS-low LSCs and AML blasts. Step 1 is FSC versus SSC which is used to isolate cells. Step 2 is FSC-A versus FSC-H used to isolate single cells. Step 3 is FSC versus DAPI which is used to isolated DAPI- live cells. Step 4 is CD19 versus CD3 used to exclude lymphocytes (CD3-CD19-). Step 5 is CD45 versus SSC used to isolate AML blasts. Step 6 is CellROX staining, CellROX deep red shown here.\n(B) Example of the number of colonies formed from ROS-low and ROS-high cells. Data adapted from Jones et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].\n(C) Example of engraftment into NSGS mice from ROS-low and ROS-high cells. Data from Pei et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/349-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Scheme for ROS-low LSCs and ROS-high AML blasts cell sorting and expected results\n(A) Example of ROS profiles from 12 primary AML specimens. These data were collected using CellROX deep red.\n(B) Example of blast gating from 6 AML specimens using CD45 versus SSC.\nStart up and set up cell sorter using best practices. Protocol as described is run on FACSAria with 70 μm nozzle at 70 PSI sheath pressure and sort rates of 500–12,000 events/s and done under purity masking.\nCritical: Sort time should be kept as short as possible with a recommended maximum time of 2 h per AML specimens. Further, it is highly recommended that sorting is performed at 4°C.\nRun each control, starting with unstained sample to optimize the voltage, gating, and compensation matrix.\nUse the unstained sample to identify sample and single cell populations\nUse DAPI to gate on live cells.\nUse CD3 and CD19 to exclude lymphocytes (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3]).",
    "Use CD45 vs. SSC to gate for AML blasts (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5]).\nUse CellROX to gate for target ROS-low and ROS-high populations. These gates should cover the lowest 20% of cells fluorescing with CellROX and the highest 20% of cells fluorescing with CellROX, respectively.\nCells are collected in a 5–15 mL conical tubes that have 1–2 mL of metabolomics media.\nCritical: CellROX is a live cell dye and is metabolized during the sorting process. Careful monitoring to ensure no to minimal change in CellROX staining is observed is essential. If a significant decrease in CellROX intensity is observed the sorting should be terminated as the ROS-low population can no longer be distinguished from cells with decreased CellROX staining.\nPopulation validation (optional)\nTiming: 8–12 weeks\nAfter sorting, to validate the stemness of the ROS-low and ROS-high populations, colony forming assays and engraftment assays can be performed (Lagadinou et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Pei et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nColony forming assay – The colony forming assay is a readout of stem and progenitor function. This assay has several caveats including that some AML specimens will not form colonies and colonies can be formed by progenitors’ cells as well as stem cells. The strength of this assay is that it requires low cell numbers.\nSuspend approximately 100,000 cells from ROS-low and ROS-high populations in 4 mL of human methylcellulose and mix.\nPlace 1 mL of each into three 35 mm cell culture dish.\nIncubate all the dishes in a secondary large bioassay dish (245 mm × 245 mm) with a small volume of water in an extra 35 mm dish to maintain humidity in the bioassay dish.\nIncubate at 37°C for 10–14 days until colonies are visible.\nColonies are then counted using a light microscope.",
    "Engraftment assay – Engraftment into immune deficient mice is the gold-standard assay for assessing stem cell function (Bonnet and Dick, 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Lapidot et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nUse NSGS mice conditioned with 25 mg/kg busulfan via intraperitoneal injection utilizing 28G syringe 24 h prior to transplant.\nTreat 100,000–2,000,000 cells primary ROS-low or ROS-high populations with OKT3 to prevent graft versus host disease (Wunderlich et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nWarm the mice under a heat lamp and then restrain the mouse in a restrainer so that the tail is out. Clean the tail with alcohol wipe.\nInject primary cells in a 0.1 mL volume of FACS Buffer intravenously through the tail vein using a 28G syringe.\nAfter 6–12 weeks, euthanize mice and collect the bone marrow.\nTo collect bone marrow, femurs and tibias are dissected from mice and stored on ice until all samples have been collected. The marrow is flushed out of the bone using 1 mL of FACS buffer.\nSpin samples at 580 × g for 5 min and aspartate FACS buffer.\nRed blood cells are then lysed by incubating samples at 20°C for 1 min in RBC lysis buffer.\nSpin samples at 580 × g for 5 min and aspartate RBC lysis buffer.\nResuspend samples in FACS buffer and filter through cell strainer to remove any clumping material.\nSpin samples at 580 × g for 5 min and aspartate FACS buffer.\nResuspend cell in FACS buffer containing antibodies including CD45, CD34, CD38, and CD123 to measure human leukemic cells and stem cells via flow cytometry."
