    "1. Preparation of Culture Media, Coated Dishes and Maintenance of hPSCs\n1.1 Media preparation\nNote: Filter all media for sterilization and store at 4 °C in the dark for up to 2 weeks. Reagent names, company and catalog numbers are listed in the Materials Table.\nDMEM/10%FBS: Combine 885 ml DMEM, 100 ml FBS, 10 ml Pen/Strep and 5 ml L-Glutamine.\nHES-medium: Combine 800 ml DMEM/F12, 200 ml KSR, 5 ml L-Glutamine, 5 ml Pen/Strep, 10 ml MEM minimum essential amino acids solution, 1 ml β-Mercaptoethanol. Add 10 ng/ml FGF-2 after filtering the medium.\n\tCAUTION: β-Mercaptoethanol is toxic, avoid inhalation, ingestion and skin contact.\nKSR-differentiation medium: Combine 820 ml Knockout DMEM, 150 ml KSR, 10 ml L-Glutamine, 10 ml Pen/Strep, 10 ml MEM minimum essential amino acids solution and 1 ml β-Mercaptoethanol.\nN2-differentiation medium: Dissolve 12 g DMEM/F12 powder in 980 ml dH2O, add 1.55 g Glucose, 2 g Sodium Bicarbonate and 100 mg APO human transferrin. Mix 2 ml dH2O with 25 mg human insulin and 40 μl 1 N NaOH, add the dissolved solution to the medium. Add 100 mM putrescine dihydrochloride, 0.5 mM selenite, 1 mM progesterone and bring the volume up to 1 L with dH2O.\n1.2 Coating of culture dishes\nMatrigel coating: Thaw 1 ml frozen matrigel aliquot by pipetting 19 ml DMEM/F12 over the aliquot until it has dissolved. Remove clumps by passing it through a 40 μm cell strainer and plate 8 ml/10 cm dish. Incubate the dishes for 1 hr at RT. Aspirate the matrigel immediately before plating the cells.\n\tNote: Work quickly with matrigel because it can clump at temperatures above 4 °C.",
    "PO/Lam/FN coating: Add 10 ml of 1x PBS containing 15 μg/ml Poly-L Ornithin hydrobromide to a 10 cm dish. Incubate the dish over night at 37 °C. Wash plates with 1x PBS once and add 10 ml/10 cm dish of 1x PBS containing 2 μg/ml mouse Laminin-I and 2 μg/ml fibronectin. Incubate the dishes over night at 37 °C. Before plating the cells, completely remove the solution and let the plates dry thoroughly at RT for 15-20 min by standing them up onto the tissue culture hood wall without the lid on. \n\tNote: The dishes are completely dry and ready for cell plating when one can see crystal structures on the surface (visible by eye). The plates can be kept at RT for a few hours in this dried state. PO/Lam/FN dishes have to be prepared 2 days ahead of time. In emergency cases Lam/FN can be incubated for 2-4 hr only. However, this may risk suboptimal differentiation/survival results.\n1.3 Maintenance of hPSCs\nNote: hPSCs are maintained on 0.1% gelatin and mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in HES-medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml FGF-2 as described previously 10,12. The cells should be split every 6-8 days.\nCoat a 10 cm dish with 8 ml 0.1% gelatin (in 1x PBS without Magnesium or Calcium) at RT for 5 min.\nThaw frozen MEFs quickly in a 37 °C water bath. Add 1 million MEFs to 10 ml DMEM/10% FBS.\nAspirate the gelatin and plate the cells. Incubate at 37 °C for at least 6 hr.\nAspirate the DMEM/10% FBS from the prepared MEF plate, wash plate with 1x PBS once and add 10 ml HES-medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride. Allow the medium to warm up at 37 °C for 20 min.",
    "Note: For manual splitting of hPSCs a laminar flow hood with an embedded microscope is used. However, the cells can be passaged using appropriate alternative methods.\nUnder a laminar flow hood with an embedded microscope, detach separate colonies using a cell lifter and let them float.\nUse a 1 ml syringe to aspirate the floating colonies and dispatch them onto the fresh, warm MEF plate. Transfer approximately one fourth of the cells to the new dish. Incubate at 37 °C.\nFeed cells daily with fresh HES medium.\n2. Plating of hPSCs for Differentiation\nNote: hPSCs should be split or plated for differentiation when the colonies are large, but still have sharp edges with as little as possible differentiating cells at their borders (see Figure 1B). When the cells are maintained using manual passaging the colonies should be large enough to easily be seen by eye. To get the right feel for this time point one can maintain a separate hPSC dish for two weeks without passaging and watch the cells reach and pass the ideal time point for passaging/differentiating them.\nPrepare 10 cm dishes with matrigel 1 hr before starting the differentiation. Successful matrigel coating can be verified at 4x magnification. \nWhen the hPSCs are ready to be split, aspirate the medium and add 4 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to the cells.\nShake the dish horizontally for 2 min vigorously until one can see the MEFs as single cells lifting off the plate under the microscope. The hPSC colonies remain attached as colonies.\nImmediately and thoroughly, aspirate the trypsin and let the plate stand at RT for 2-4 min.\nAdd 2 ml of HES-medium to the plate and using a P1000 pipette, detach the cells.",
    "Note: If the cells cannot be lifted off the surface easily, the plate can be incubated empty at RT for another 2-3 min.\nTransfer the cells to 8 ml HES-medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride.\nAspirate the matrigel from a previously prepared 10 cm dish. Plate the cells at a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio (for example: The cells from one 10 cm dish are split into two 10 cm dishes) onto the matrigel plate. Incubate at 37 °C over night.\n\tNote: This plating should result in approximately 100,000 cells/cm2.\n3. Induction of Neural Differentiation\nNote: The differentiation can be initiated (day 0) when the cells are 90-100% confluent (see Figure 1C), usually the following day. If the accurate confluency is not reached yet, the cells can be fed daily with HES-medium until they are ready for differentiation. Alternatively, the initial number of cells plated can be increased.\nOn day 0 to 3, feed the cells daily with 10 ml/10 cm dish KSR-differentiation medium containing 0.1 μM LDN193189 and 10 μM SB431542.\nOn day 4 and 5 feed the cells with 75% KSR-differentiation medium and 25% N2-differentiation medium both containing LDN193189 and SB431542.\nOn day 6 and 7 feed the cells with 50% KSR-differentiation medium and 50% N2-differentiation medium both containing LDN193189 and SB431542.\nOn day 8 and 9 feed the cells with 25% KSR-differentiation medium and 75% N2-differentiation medium both containing LDN193189 and SB431542.\nOn day 9 and 10 prepare PO/Lam/FN dishes as indicated in 1.2.2 for replating of the cells on day 11.\nOn day 10 feed cells with N2-differentiation medium containing LDN193189 and SB431542.\n4. Replating in Droplets for NC Specification\nOn day 11 aspirate Lam/FN from the previously prepared plates and let them dry completely at RT for 20-30 min, as explained in 1.2.2.",
    "Remove medium from the differentiating cells, wash the cells once with 1x PBS and add 8 ml accutase/10 cm dish. Incubate for 20 min at 37 °C.\nUsing a cell lifter, detach the cells and resuspend them in accutase with a 5 ml pipette. Transfer the suspension to a 15 ml tube.\nAdd 5 ml of 1x PBS and spin the cells for 5 min at 114 x g.\nResuspend the cells in 10 ml 1x PBS. To ensure a single cell suspension, filter them through a 40 μm cell strainer and count the cells using a hemocytometer or equivalent technique.\nSpin the cells down and resuspend them in N2-differentiation medium containing 200 μM Ascorbic Acid (AA), 20 ng/ml BDNF, 100 ng/ml FGF8, 20 ng/ml SHH, 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride at the concentration of 100,000-150,000 cells/10 μl.\nUsing a repeat-pipettor, plate 10 μl droplets close to each other without them touching onto the dried PO/Lam/FN 15 cm dishes.\n\tNote: One 10 cm dish of differentiated cells normally results in approximately 2-3 times 15 cm dishes or approximately 100 x 10 μl droplets/15 cm dish.\nLet the droplets stand at RT for 20-30 min, then very carefully (not to disturb the droplets) add 30 ml of N2/AA/BDNF/FGF8/SHH/Y and incubate at 37 °C.\nOn day 12, carefully feed the cells with 20 ml/15 cm dish N2/AA/BDNF/FGF8/SHH.\nFrom day 14-17 feed the cells every second or third day with N2/AA/BDNF/FGF8.\nOn day 16 and 17 prepare PO/Lam/FN plates to replate NC cells after FACS sorting.\n5. Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) of NC cells\nNote: The preparation of the cells for FACS requires approximately 2 hr.",
    "On day 18 remove medium, wash the cells once with 1x PBS in the dish and add 12 ml accutase. Incubate the cells for 20 min at 37 °C.\nUsing a cell lifter, detach the cells from the surface and let them float. Pipette the cells into suspension using a 5 ml pipette, transfer them to a 50 ml tube and add 30 ml of 1x PBS. Spin the cells for 5 min at 114 x g.\nUsing a P1000 pipette, resuspend the cells in 1 ml of 2% FBS/HBSS (the HBSS contains 15 mM HEPES). Add 19 ml of 2% FBS/HBSS and filter the cells through a 40 μm cell strainer to ensure a single cell suspension. Incubate the cells on ice for 15 min for antibody blocking and then count them using a hemocytometer.\nSpin the cells down and resuspend them at the concentration of 10 million cells/ml in 2% FBS/HBSS.\nSet aside 1 million cells each for the unstained, single-stained (HNK-1 only and p75 only) and secondary antibody stained only (APC only and 488 only) FACS controls.\nAdd 5 μl of HNK-1 and 5 μl of p75 primary antibody per 10 million cells in 1 ml suspension to the proper samples and incubate for 20 min on ice.\nWash cells in 10 ml 1x PBS (centrifuge 5 min at 114 x g) and resuspend the cells in 1 ml 2% FBS/HBSS. Add 2 μl of APC and 1 μl of 488 secondary antibody per 10 million cells in 1 ml suspension to the proper samples and incubate for 20 min on ice in the dark.\n\tNote: APC and 488 are the secondary antibodies used here for the HNK-1 and p75 staining, respectively.",
    "Wash the cells in 10 ml 1x PBS twice, resuspend 10 million cells in 500 μl of 2% FBS/HBSS containing DAPI (at 0.5 ng/μl) or alternative appropriate live cell stain to exclude dead cells from the FACS analysis.\nTransfer the samples to appropriate FACS tubes.\nPrepare FACS tubes with 0.5 ml 2% FBS/HBSS for cell collection.\n\tNote: The cells and collection tubes are kept on ice in the dark during the sorting time.\nUsing a cell sorting machine with lasers that can detect DAPI, APC and 488 sort DAPI-/HNK-1+/P75+ double positive cells.\n\tNote: Preparation time and handling of the cells leads to a small percentage of cell death, DAPI stains dead cells only and thus allows for these cells to be excluded from the sorted population. Any alternative live/dead stain works equally well for this purpose. DAPI itself does not cause cytotoxicity in the live cell population.\n6. Replating of Sorted Cells, NC Maintenance and Expansion\nNote: FACS sorted cells should be handled with special care to ensure optimal survival. Keep them on ice until replating them. Do not vortex or pipette them harshly. The cells can be resuspended by flicking the tube.\nAfter FACS sorting, count the NC cells, then spin them down and resuspend in N2-differentiation medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml FGF2, 20 ng/ml EGF and 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride in the volume appropriate to replate them at 30,000 cells/10 μl droplets.\nThoroughly dry previously prepared PO/Lam/FN plates and plate approximately 50-70 droplets per 10 cm dish. Let the dishes stand at RT for 20-30 min.\nVery carefully add 20 ml/10 cm dish of N2/FGF2/EGF/Y-27632 without disturbing the droplets. Incubate the cells at 37 °C.\nFeed the cells every 2-3 days with N2/FGF2/EGF.",
    "Note: NC cells are expanded or passaged approximately every 4-5 days or when they start piling up within the droplets.\nTo passage the NC cells, remove the medium, wash the cells once with 1x PBS and add 8 ml accutase/10 cm dish. Incubate for 20 min at 37 °C.\nPipette the cells off the plate using a 5 ml pipette and transfer them to a 15 ml tube. Add 6 ml 1x PBS.\nSpin the cells for 5 min at 114 x g.\nResuspend the cells in N2-differentiation medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml FGF2, 20 ng/ml EGF and 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride in order to have 20,000 cells/10 μl droplet.\nReplate the cells in 10 μl droplets onto dried PO/Lam/FN plates. Let the dishes stand at RT for 20-30 min.\nCarefully add 20 ml/10 cm dish of N2/FGF2/EGF/Y-27632. Incubate at 37 °C.\n\tNote: NC cells can be maintained or expanded for up to 2 weeks as a relatively homogeneous progenitor population. Longer culture may lead them to differentiate into various progeny cell types.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
