    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFigure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] provides an easy-to-follow flowchart of the protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3100-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Flowchart outlining the steps involved in the protocol\nEC/LP, epithelial cells/lamina propria; MUS, muscle; EM, enzyme mix; CM, complete media; HBSS, Hank’s buffered salt solution; DTT, Dithiothreitol; RBC, red blood cells.\nPre-processing of specimen\nTiming: 10 min\nPreprocessing of complete full thickness tissue specimen.\nRinse tissue thoroughly with chilled HBSS.\nPlace complete full thickness tissue on staging board, mucosal side up (serosal side down), gently blot with paper towels, alternate rinsing and blotting.\nNote: Do not drag the paper towel across the mucosal side of the specimen.\nKeep the specimen wet, rinsing and blotting until the tissue is visibly clean of blood, debris and mucus.\nWork gently, and quickly.\nPlace the blotted tissue on clean paper towels, straighten it making sure all layers are distinguishable,\nNote: perform as efficiently as possible, do not let tissue dry.\nTissue should be rinsed and blotted within 10 min.\nWorking quickly ensures the highest viability of all cell populations.\nEpithelial/lamina propria layer isolation\nTiming: 2 h\nIsolation of lamina propria layer from intestinal tissue.\nDissect the specimen after the picture is taken. The steps below are an example for processing a full thickness tissue segment.\nLamina propria layer (avoid the inclusion any muscle or fat tissue).\nUsing curved, round-ended scissors, press down while “lightly pinching” the lamina propria with forceps.\nCut strips by gently bearing down on the scissors at the deepest part of their curve (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Avoid cutting into the muscularis propria.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3100-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustration showing the proper placement of bent-tip forceps and scissors to remove epithelial layer from intestinal tissue\nCut at least four to six strips of at least 2 cm length each.",
    "Note: Smaller samples can be used but are not as easy to manipulate and give lower numbers of cells. This is particularly important when considering the cell populations associated with different levels of inflammation in IBD.\nThe enzymes solutions here were used for samples up to 2 g per enzyme solution.\nTransfer strips to a 100 mm Falcon petri dish with HBSS to prevent tissue from drying.\nThe above strips are used for epithelial (EC) and lamina propria (LP) fraction isolation.\nRemove muscle tissue with scalpel (avoid fat). Proceed to \"Muscular Layer Isolation\".\nTransfer lamina propria strips to a small weigh boat. Weigh the strips and record the weight.\nIncubate strips in DTT (75 mg of DTT in 50 mL of HBSS), stirring only fast enough to keep the strips from settling, for 30 min at RT.\nCover DTT cup with the lid.\nSet the speed of stirrer to achieve slow stirring.\nAfter 30 minutes, use forceps to remove strips from DTT and transfer to a 100 mm Falcon Petri dish with 10 mL of HBSS. Rinse thoroughly.\nUsing forceps, transfer tissue strips to 10 mL EM1-A tube (contains the enzyme).\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C bath, invert for 10 s every 5 min.\nFilter EM1-A through 100 μm cell strainer filter.\nTransfer the partially digested tissue from the top of the strainer to the EM1-B tube (Contains 10 mL). Incubate EM1-B tube at 37 for 30 min (as in step 10a). Proceed with EM1-B in step 16.\nSpin the filtrate at 330 × g for 5 min, 4°C and resuspend pellet in 5 mL complete media.\nTake 40 μL of EM1-A cell suspension and mix with 40 μL of Trypan Blue.\nCount cells using a hemacytometer and record the cell number and viability.",
    "Leave the rest of cell suspension of EM1-A on ice.\nAfter counting, proceed to “RBC LYSIS PROTOCOL”. After red cell lysis, count cells again.\nNote: This is final count, and the fraction is labeled EC-LP1.\nTransfer strips from step 10 to EM1-B tube (containing the enzyme) and incubate as in step 10a.\nAfter 30 min, filter through 100 μm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the filtrate at 330 × g, 5 min, 4°C and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of complete media.\nRemove 40 μL of EM1-B cell suspension, mix with 40 μL of Trypan Blue and count cell number and viability.\nAfter counting proceed to “RBC LYSIS PROTOCOL”.\nNote: This fraction is now called EC-LP2.\nAfter RBC lysis, re-suspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of complete media and count cell number/cell viability again (RBC contamination should drop dramatically).\nNote: The cell number and cell viability are final values for EC-LP2.\nCritical: Frothing can be avoided by slowly resuspending the cells, and not allowing bubbles to be introduced during mixing. Time of digestion can be variable but must be constantly monitored, as over- or under-digestion will affect cell yield, quality and viability by live/ dead counts as indicated by trypan blue exclusion. Final tissue digest should be carefully evaluated for visual appearance (should be viscous, with fibrous threads, and devoid of any obvious tissue chunks) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3100-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Appearance of undigested, under-digested and fully digested tissue\nMuscular layer isolation\nTiming: 2 h\nIsolation of muscle layer from intestinal tissue.\nMuscular layer isolation is performed in parallel with EC isolation.\nWeigh the amount of muscle tissue in a small weigh boat and record it.\nAt least 2–3 g are needed get enough single cells from the muscle layer for 10× Genomics protocol.",
    "Transfer the muscle to a 100 mm Falcon petri dish.\nAlthough no infectious tissue is ever used in this study, all steps are carried out in a BSL2 biosafety cabinet to minimize biohazard safety exposure.\nUsing #21 curved scalpel blade, mince the tissue, with a rocking motion.\nCritical: Do not drag the scalpel blade to “tear” the tissue. Cuts should be very clean with the rocking motion of the blade. The easiest method to mince the tissue in this way is to cut strips.\nCut the strips into small squares or approximately 2 mm2. Pile the small squares up and mince with the rocking blade motion.\nTransfer the minced tissue from the petri dish to the 50 mL conical tube containing 10 mL of collagenase II (2 mg/mL), 2.5% PSF in RPMI (EM3).\nUse a small amount (about 2–3 mL) of collagenase II solution to rinse the petri dish and add back to the tube.\nIncubate at 37°C for 60 min. Invert tube continuously for 30 s every 15 min.\nAfter 60 min, filter through a 100 μm pore filter.\nTransfer the partially digested tissue to a petri dish containing 10 mL of (enzyme free) complete media.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C under 5% CO2.\nCentrifuge the filtrate solution (330 × g, 5 min, and 4°C), and re-suspend the pellet in ∼5 mL of complete media.\nNote: Keep on ice until the retained fraction is finished incubating.\nAfter 30-min incubation from 26a, filter through 100 μm pore cell strainer.\nCentrifuge at 330 × g, 4°C.\nResuspend pellet in complete media and combine with muscle filtrate fraction from step 27.\nCount the cell number and viability of the muscle fraction (pooled) by combining 40 μL of the cell suspension and 40 μL of trypan blue.",
    "Remove red blood cells using “RBC LYSIS PROTOCOL”.\nCount cell number and viability and label MUS.\nRBC lysis\nTiming: 30 min\nRemoval of red blood cells (RBCs) from isolated single cell suspension.\nBring the cell suspension from the ice bucket to the centrifuge and spin (330 × g, 5 min, 4°C).\nRe-suspend the pellet in working solution at 2 million cells/mL of working solution.\nIncubate with RBC buffer 5 min at 25°C.\nAdd 2× volume of complete media to halt lysis, centrifuge (330 × g, 5 min, 4°C), wash two additional times with 10-mL cold HBSS.\nAfter final wash, re-suspend the pellet in 5 mL of complete media and count.\nMethanol fixation of isolated single cells\nTiming: 10 min\nFixation of isolated single cells for storage and subsequent analysis.\nCentrifuge 0.1–1.0 × 106 cells in 15 mL round bottom culture tubes at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nThe exact cell number you fix is solely dependent on how many cells are obtained from each layer, ensuring multiple aliquots for each layer are prepared.\nRemove the supernatant without disrupting the cell pellet and add 1 mL chilled 1× PBS (Media Core #121–1000) using a wide-bore pipette tip (MBP #3531).\nGently pipette 10 times mixing until the cells are completely suspended. Spin the suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRepeat above two steps (step 38 and 39).\nRemove the supernatant without disrupting the cell pellet.\nAdd 200 μL chilled 1X PBS using a wide-bore pipette tip and gently pipette the mixture 10 times or until cells are completely suspended.\nAdd 800 μL chilled 100% methanol drop by drop to the 200 μL cell suspension in the tube while gently mixing on a vortex (at the lowest speed setting). This prevents cells from clumping.",
    "Store cells at −20°C for 30 min, then transfer to −80°C for long-term storage (several months).\nPause point: Methanol-fixed isolated cells can be stored until needed for scRNA-seq analysis.\nViability assessment based on dye exclusion and apoptosis\nTiming: 30 min\nQuality of the isolated cells (after single cell isolation and before fixation) can be assessed by Trypan blue staining. As a quality control measure, flow cytometry analysis can be performed with cells stained with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI).\nWash cells twice with cold PBS and then resuspend cells in 1× Binding Buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL.\nTransfer 100 μL of the solution (1 × 105 cells) to a 5 mL culture tube.\nAdd 5 μL of FITC Annexin V and 5 μL PI.\nGently vortex the cells and incubate for 15 min at 25°C in the dark.\nAdd 400 μL of 1× Binding Buffer to each tube. Analyze by flow cytometry within 1 h.\nSingle cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)\nIsolated single cells can be processed and analyzed for scRNA-seq using 10× Chromium kit (following manufacturers’ instructions and as outlined in our publication).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]"
