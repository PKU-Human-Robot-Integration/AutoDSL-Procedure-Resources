    "Dissection of larvae and pupae by ventral filletingPick larvae and pupae of the appropriate age. Tracheal progenitors are activated during the late second-instar (L2) stage and remodel the trachea throughout the third-instar (L3) and pupal stages.The staging of Drosophila melanogaster larvae and pupae is described in (Ashburner, 2005).Young (L1 to early L3 stage) larvae [see Ashburner (2005) for more information on larval staging] will burrow into the food as they feed. To isolate these larvae, scoop out a portion of the food with the spoon end of the spatula and place it into a petri dish filled with PBS. Gently separate the food with the spatula until larvae can be seen floating in the PBS, and then transfer the larvae into a new PBS-filled petri dish with a small paintbrush or a glass Pasteur pipette. Late L3 stage larvae that are about to enter puparium formation will migrate onto the walls of the vial or bottle they are cultured in, and because of this behavior are commonly referred to as wandering L3 larvae. Wet a small paintbrush by dipping briefly in PBS and blot the excess PBS on a KimwipeTM. Gently pick up larvae from the wall of the vessel with the tip of the brush. Dip the tip of the brush with the larvae into a petri dish filled with PBS and move the brush back and forth to allow the larvae to be transferred to the PBS.  During the pupal stages, tracheal metamorphosis occurs rapidly, and so it is necessary to obtain pupae of precise age. To do this, locate animals that have just entered pupariation [0 h after puparium formation (APF)]; they should be white, attached to the side of the vessel, and immobile (Ashburner, 2005) (Figure 1A).",
    "Gently detach these pupae with a small wet paintbrush and transfer them into a new vial. Set the pupae onto the walls of the vial so that the ventral surface of the animal is attached to plastic (the way they normally attach to the vessel wall).  Incubate at 25 °C until the desired time APF has been reached, then gently detach and pick up the pupae with a small wet paintbrush and transfer to a dissection dish.  When transferring, be careful not to damage the pupae by putting too much pressure on them.Preparations for dissection.Using forceps pick up insect pins one at a time and insert them vertically tip down into the silicone elastomer layer of the dissection dish to be used. Insert just deep enough that the pins are held in place by the silicone elastomer. This way, pins can be easily retrieved with forceps and moved to where they are needed during dissection.Ventral-filleting larvae, and pupae younger than 12 h APF (before eversion of the head) (see Videos 1 and 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Dissecting larva  <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Dissecting pupa younger than 12 h APF Place Petri dishes containing larvae on ice for 5 to 10 min. The cold temperature will slow the larva’s movements and facilitate dissection. Do not leave larvae on ice for more than 45 min. Pupae are immobile and will not need to be exposed to cold temperature prior to dissection. Fill a dissection dish with cold PBS and move the larva or pupa into the dissection dish. With forceps, turn the animal ventral side up, and gently hold it in place using forceps.",
    "Locate the posterior (Figure 2A and 3A, white arrows) of the left and right tracheal dorsal trunks, a set of large air-filled tubes running along the anterior-posterior axis on the dorsal side of the animal, and insert a pin between the trunks at the posterior (Figure 2A and 3A, white arrowheads) into the silicone elastomer. Insert another pin (Figure 2A and 3A, black arrowheads) between the dorsal trunks at the anterior end of the animal (Figure 2A and 3A, black arrows).  When dissecting larvae, first stretch the animal by pulling on the anterior with forceps, and then insert the second pin just below the pigmented mouthparts.   Gently pull up on the ventral epidermis (and cuticle in pupae) with forceps, and carefully insert the bottom blade of the Vannas spring scissors where the posterior pin has been inserted, and slide the blade just under the ventral epidermis. If necessary, enlarge the opening made by the pin by pulling on the epidermis with forceps before inserting the scissor blade. Cut towards the anterior of the animal (Figure 2A and 3A, horizontal dashed lines). Pupae can also be cut from anterior to posterior, although larvae are more easily cut from posterior to anterior.  Grasp the edges of the cut epidermis (and cuticle in pupae) with forceps, pull gently to the side and secure with pins (Figure 2B-C and 3B-C; asterisks) so that the epidermis is one flat layer (Figure 2C and 3C). Make additional cuts to the epidermis and cuticle as necessary (Figure 3A vertical dashed lines) to allow the sample to be pinned flat. Be careful to not pin or damage tracheal branches during the process.  Remove internal organs by pulling on them with forceps.",
    "Cut any terminal tracheal branches attached to the tissue (Figure 2D, arrows) so that the tissue can be removed. The main tracheal branches [as described in Manning and Krasnow (1993)] should now be visible (Figure 2C, E and 3C); they are rigid air-filled tubes and attached to the epidermis. Clear remaining debris and tissue around tracheal branches by gently pipetting PBS onto the sample with a Pasteur pipette.Ventral-filleting pupae older than 12 hours APF (after head eversion) (see Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Dissecting pupa older than 12 h APF  Pupae that have completed the larval-pupal molt and everted their heads (Figure 1C), which occurs around 12 h APF, need to be removed from the pupal case prior to dissection. To do this, move the pupa onto a dry dissection dish ventral side down. Work under a stereomicroscope, and hold a pair of Dumont #5 forceps in each hand. Carefully hold the pupa with forceps using the non-dominant hand and use forceps in the dominant hand to insert the tip of an insect pin through the posterior end of the pupal case just below where the pupa has detached from the pupal case (Figure 4A, white arrowhead). Continue inserting the pin into the silicone elastomer layer of the dish; the pupa should be securely pinned to the dish. Using Vannas spring scissors make a horizontal cut through both layers of the pupal case at the anterior end above the pupa’s head (Figure 4A, vertical dashed line). Remove the rest of the pupal operculum with forceps. Gently insert scissors just under the pupal case along the anterior-posterior axis (careful not to damage the pupa inside), and cut the pupal case from anterior to the posterior (Figure 4A, horizontal dashed line).",
    "Carefully peel away the pupal case and remove it or pin it down to the dish (Figure 4C, asterisks), making extra cuts in the pupal case as necessary to relieve any pressure exerted by the case on the pupa inside. Gently pick up the pupa from the pinned case with a small wet brush and transfer to a new dissection dish. An alternative method to remove the pupa from the pupal case is described in Wang and Yoder (2011).  With a wet brush (or very gently with forceps) orient the pupa ventral side up.  Gently holding the pupa in place with forceps, insert a pin through the head (Figure 4D, black arrowhead).With forceps, pull up on the ventral epidermis at the opening made by the pin and slide the bottom blade of the Vannas spring scissors just under the ventral epidermis. Cut all the way to the posterior of the animal (Figure 4D, black dashed line).Make a small cut in the dorsal epidermis from posterior to anterior just to the midpoint of the abdomen (Figure 4D, black dotted line). This cut allows the pupa to be pinned flat.  Grasp the cut edges of the ventral epidermis with forceps and pin down so that the epidermis is one flat layer (Figure 4E). Much of the internal tissues of the pupa will be histolyzed and can be removed by gently pipetting PBS onto the sample with a Pasteur pipette. Pipetting in the anterior to posterior direction results in least amount of damage to the tracheal branches. Any remaining tissue can be gently pulled out with forceps.Fix the dissected larvae and pupae.Remove the PBS containing detached internal tissues with a P1000 pipet.",
    "Gently pipet 1 to 2 ml of 4% PFA along the sides of the dish, enough to cover all of the samples.  Place the dissection dish on an orbital shaker in the fume hood. Cover samples with a light protected box if samples express fluorescent proteins. Set the shaker on a medium-low setting (i.e., 3 or 4) and allow the PFA to fix the samples at room temperature for 30 min.Remove the 4% PFA and properly dispose as hazardous waste. Gently pipet 1 to 2 ml room temperature PBS, and shake for 5 minutes to wash out residual PFA. Repeat 2 more times.  With forceps and working under the stereomicroscope, carefully remove the pins holding the samples in place. Transfer the fixed samples into a 4-well dish for staining.  Up to 6 larvae and 8 pupae can be stained in each well.   Proceed with the staining procedure described below or store the samples immersed in PBS at 4 °C with the plate wrapped in Parafilm. Samples can be stored for up to a few weeks.Immunofluorescence staining larval and pupal tracheaPermeabilize the fixed sample(s) by incubating in 650 μl PBS with 0.1% TritonTM X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. Pipet in liquids gently along the sides of each well to prevent damaging the samples. If samples express a fluorescent reporter, cover the dish with aluminum foil or a light protected box for this and subsequent steps.Remove the PBS with 0.1% TritonTM X-100, add 650 μl block solution into each well, and incubate at room temperature for 30 min on a Nutator mixer.Dilute primary antibody in block solution. Remove the block solution from the step above and apply 650 μl of the primary antibody solution per well.",
    "If amount of the antibody solution needs to be conserved, add just enough to immerse the samples, about 250 μl per well. Incubate overnight at 4 °C on a Nutator mixer.  Remove the antibody solution, add 650 μl PBS 0.1% Triton, and incubate on a Nutator mixer for 5 min at room temperature to wash away residual antibodies. Remove wash solution, and repeat 2 more times.   Wash the samples 3 more times in 650 μl PBS 0.1% Triton for 30 min each. These longer washing steps are necessary to remove any antibodies that might have been trapped in the tracheal tubes. Dilute fluorescence conjugated secondary antibody in PBS 0.1% Triton, and apply 250 to 650 μl to each well. Incubate on a Nutator mixer for 1 h at room temperature.  Cover the dish with aluminum foil or a light protective box for this and subsequent steps.Wash the samples in PBS 0.1% Triton 3 times for 5 min each.  Apply 650 μl DAPI staining solution each well and incubate for 10 to 20 min.Remove the DAPI solution, and wash the samples with PBS 0.1% Triton 3 times for 5 min each, and then 3 times for 30 min each.Mount samples on glass slidesCut two pieces of black electrical tape about 20 mm x 5 mm and affix to the glass slide. Leave a space slightly less than the width of the coverslip between the two pieces of tape (Figure 5A). The pieces of tape are used to create a small space between the slide and the coverslip (Figure 5B); if the samples are mounted without the tape, the coverslip may crush the sample and damage tracheal structures. Add two to three drops of Vectashield® mounting media onto the glass slide between the two pieces of tape.",
    "Place your samples in the Vectashield® and adjust the orientation of the samples so that the internal surface of the sample containing the tracheal branches is on top and the exterior surface of the epidermis is on the bottom. To facilitate imaging, orient the samples on the slide so that when observing the slide through the microscope the anterior is on the left and the posterior on the right. With forceps, remove any dust particles that might be lodged in the sample.  Cover samples with a coverslip and allow the Vectashield® to fill the space between the slide and coverslip, gently push down on the coverslip with forceps if necessary. Remove any extra Vectashield leaking from under the coverslip with a Kimwipe. Apply clear nail polish around the edges of the coverslip to seal in the samples and Vectashield®. Cover the slides with a light protective box, and allow the nail polish to dry at room temperature (approximately 10 min).  Proceed with microscopic analysis, or store the slides at 4 °C."
