  "procedures": [
    "Aplysia are invertebrates and thus not subjected to IAUC approval. To minimize discomfort to animals, ensure that they are fully anesthetized before applying the surgical techniques described below.\n1. Animal Selection and Anesthetization\nSelect an active animal by offering it seaweed and confirming that bite intervals are no greater than between 3 and 5 s.\nAnesthetize the animal with 0.333 molar magnesium chloride (see Table 1) by injecting near the head with an 18 G needle on a 60 mL syringe so that the highest concentration of anesthetic will be around the buccal mass.\nTake care to penetrate both the outer epithelium and the inner tissue layer with the needle. Ensure that the injection is roughly under the rhinophore, halfway between the rhinophore and the foot, and the needle should enter obliquely, pointing in the direction of the jaws.\nAfter 10 min, gently attempt to insert a pin into the gill and rhinophore, verifying that these do not retract, to ensure sufficient anesthetization.\nEnsure that the lips and jaw of the slug are relaxed so that the odontophore can be exposed.\nNOTE: The wrinkling on the lips of Figure 2A indicates that the animal’s lips and jaw are not sufficiently relaxed for the surgical procedure to be performed without damage. The smooth, relaxed lips of Figure 2B indicate that the jaws are fully relaxed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60030/60030fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Tension and Relaxation in Anesthetized Aplysia Mouths. (A) Aplysia showing a high degree of muscle tension around the lips. This correlates with jaw tension and contraindicates proceeding with the surgery. (B) Aplysia with relaxed lips, showing the inside of jaws (light grey). Colors again correspond to those observed in the animal.

    "If an animal’s lips are not relaxed, inject an additional 30 mL of magnesium chloride and wait another 5 min. If this does not result in lip relaxation, return them to an isolated container with good water flow to allow them to recover (see step 4) and proceed with a different animal.\n2. Exposing the Radular Surface\nPosition the slug so that the head hangs downward, allowing the buccal mass to settle against the jaws.\nApply pressure with the thumb and forefinger to push the buccal mass toward the jaws, holding the buccal mass in place.\nRotate the jaws so that they are visible. At the same time, maintain the pressure on the buccal mass so that the prow of the buccal mass is visible through the jaws. (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60030/60030fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Supporting the Buccal Mass Against the Inside of the Jaws. Fingers support the buccal mass that has been pushed up against the inside edge of the jaws until the tip of the prow can be seen.

If the jaws are not sufficiently relaxed, use the forceps to gently grasp the edge of the cleft to assist this process.\nCAUTION: This pressure does risk greater damage to the animal.\nOnce the surface is exposed, work the jaws clear of the anterior portion of the radular surface all the way around the perimeter. This makes the odontophore less likely to retract (Figure 4). Ensure that no more than half of the walls of the odontophore is exposed.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60030/60030fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4: Partial Eversion of the Odontophore. The radular surface is fully exposed, but the sides of the odontophore are not uncovered, making this only a partial eversion. Further eversion will likely result in damage to the animal. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60030/60030fig4large.jpg]\nNOTE: A full eversion of the odontophore will cause major muscle damage from which the animals are very slow to recover.\n3. Surgical Incisions\nOnce the radular surface is fully exposed, arrange the slug under a dissection scope for the surgery.\nAlternatively, use a wide rubber band and a third hand to stabilize the jaws and radular surface for the surgery, especially while learning. This, however, adds time and increased tissue damage to the procedure, which makes it less ideal over the long term.\nPlace the radular surface so that the cleft side faces the investigator.\nGently grasp the radular surface, near the radular base, so that a horizontal fold is formed perpendicular to the anatomical crease. Use fine scissors to cut through this fold, making an incision along the anatomical crease (Figure 5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60030/60030fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Location of Incision to the Radular Surface. (A) Radular surface, with an incision.

(Figure 6)\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60030/60030fig6.jpg",

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60030/60030fig6large.jpg]\nReach into through the incision, grasp both strands of I7, and pull them up through the incision, where as much as the muscle can be cut away as is practical (Figure 7).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60030/60030fig7.jpg\nFigure 7: Pulling the I7 Muscle Strand Through the Incision. The I7 muscle is highly elastic and can be pulled up through the incision for removal.

Post-operative Care\nAfter lesions have been performed, grasp the anterior tentacles, and push down on the radular surface to return the slug to its original configuration.\nPlace post-surgical animals in a protected environment with good water flow. Increased oxygenation speeds the recovery. Ensure that the animals are alert and responsive on the day after surgery. If this is not the case, it can be assumed that they will not recover.\nNOTE: Animals will usually begin to feed on the first or second day after surgery. Even animals that are having trouble biting should be offered seaweed, as it is our anecdotal observation that an animal’s recovery is improved by its attempts to eat.\n5. For Sub-radular Fiber Lesion\nFollow the steps from 1.1 through 3.5\nInsert the tip of a small straight scalpel blade (#11 or similar) through the incision with the sharp edge angled upwards. Gently scrape the fine muscular fibers from the underside of the radular surface. (Figure 8).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60030/60030fig8.jpg",
