    "Cell culture and maintenancePerform all cell culture-based work in a class II biological safety cabinet/tissue culture hood. Ensure work surface and materials are sterilized using 70% (v/v) ethanol.Grow mammalian cells of choice in complete growth medium using 10 cm cell culture dishes or cell culture flasks in a humidified CO2 incubator (95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). Here, we use mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from C57BL/6 mice and MEFs lacking the dsRNA transporter, SIDT2, as our gene of interest (see Note 2).Maintain cells using standard cell culture procedures or as recommended by the supplier. Here, split MEFs approximately every 3-4 days or before cells reach 100% confluency using standard cell culture procedures (see Note 3).One day prior to stimulation, split the cells as above and determine cell number using a hemocytometer or other appropriate methods under a light microscope.Quantification of poly(I:C) uptake by flow cytometrySeed 1 x 104 cells in a 24 well plate in triplicate for the following conditions in a total volume of 500 µl of complete growth medium (cells may be seeded for additional conditions as required):UnstimulatedStimulated with poly(I:C) (see Note 4)Let cells adhere and rest overnight in a humidified CO2 incubator (95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C).The next morning, remove cells from the incubator and add 1 µg/ml of fluorescein-poly(I:C) to the cell culture medium (see Note 5).Stimulate cells in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.After 24 h of stimulation, carefully aspirate complete growth medium from each well with a glass Pasteur pipette using a vacuum aspiration system.Wash cells with 1 ml of cold 1x PBS using a P1000 pipette. Carefully add PBS on the side of the well to avoid dislodging cells.Repeat Step B6 for a total of 3 washes.",
    "Harvest cells by adding 500 µl of Trypsin to each well and incubate cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 min.Add 500 µl of complete growth medium to each well.Gently resuspend cells by pipetting up and down 3-5 times.Transfer resuspended cells to new individual 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.Centrifuge cells in a microcentrifuge for 3 min at 500 x g and resuspend the pellet in 500 µl PBS supplemented with 10% FBS.Add 10 µl of RNase A enzyme (5 mg/ml stock) to each well at a final concentration of 100 µg/ml (see Note 6).Incubate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Centrifuge cells in a microcentrifuge for 3 min at 500 x g.Carefully aspirate RNase A solution from each well. Resuspend cells in 1 ml cold PBS.Repeat Step B15 for a total of 3-5 washes.Resuspend cells in 200 µl of 10% FBS/PBS.Transfer cells to individual 1.2 ml Micro Titertubes and leave on ice.Analyze the incorporated fluorescence of cells of both genotypes and using flow cytometry. Compare the histograms and corresponding mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) between fluorescein-poly(I:C)-stimulated cells and unstimulated cells (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180614/20180614022702_8331.jpgFigure 1. Analysis of poly(I:C)-fluorescein uptake by flow cytometry. The endocytic activity of WT and Sidt2-/- MEFs was assessed by measuring the uptake of fluorescein-conjugated poly(I:C) following 24 h stimulation. A. Representative histograms for the mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) for each genotype are shown. B. Mean percentage of poly(I:C)-fluorescein positive cells. n = 3 technical replicates and errors bars represent ± SEM. Loss of SIDT2 did not affect poly(I:C) uptake.",
    "Confocal analysis of poly(I:C) subcellular localizationSeed 5 x 103 cells in an 8 well chamber slide for the following conditions in a total volume of 200 µl of complete growth medium (cells may be seeded for additional conditions as required):UnstimulatedStimulated with poly(I:C)The next morning, remove cells from the incubator and add 1 µg/ml of rhodamine-poly(I:C) to the cell culture medium (see Note 5).Incubate cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.Carefully aspirate and discard complete growth medium from each well with a P200 pipette.Wash cells with 200 ml of cold 1x PBS using a P1000 pipette.Repeat Step C5 for a total of 3 washes.After washes, add 200 µl PBS supplemented with 10% FBS to each well.Add 10 µl of RNase A enzyme (5 mg/ml stock) to each well at a final concentration of 100 µg/ml (see Note 6).Incubate cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Carefully aspirate RNase A solution from each well. Wash cells with 200 µl cold PBS.Repeat Step C11 for a total of 3 washes.Fix cells with 200 µl of 4% PFA for 10 min on ice.Wash cells with 200 µl cold PBS.Repeat Step C14 for a total of 3 washes.Stain cells with 100 ng/ml DAPI solution in a final volume of 200 µl per well for 10 min at room temperature (see Note 7).Wash cells with 200 µl cold PBS.Repeat Step C17 for a total of 3 washes. After the final wash, add 200 µl of PBS to each well.Slides are now ready for imaging or can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.Acquire images using a ZEISS LSM 780 confocal microscope (an equivalent microscope can be used) with a 25x oil immersion objective lens.Acquire Z-stack of 0.",
    "25 μm slices from the top to the bottom of the cells (Figure 2A).Save images as .lsm files and separate each condition into individual folders (e.g., WT untreated, WT pIC treated, KO untreated, KO pIC treated). Drag and drop all folders into a single folder (see Note 8).Images are now ready for analysis using FIJI/ImageJ software (see below)."
