    "The protocol is conducted according to institutional guidelines relating to the handling of human biospecimens and following the current standard operative procedures of our clinical laboratory. The use of EA data and clinical information of patients being tested follows the guidelines of our institution’s human research ethics committee.\n1. Laboratory Equipment and Assay Kit Contents\nStore the EA kit at 2–8 °C when not in use.\nEach EA test consists of 5 different kinds of tubes; use each one for a different portion of the test (see section 2).\nUse tube #1 (the “Control” tube) to measure the basal activity of the non-specific oxidative burst of patient’s neutrophils in the absence of a specific antibody.\nUse tube #2 (the “Sample” tube) to measure the oxidative burst in response to the LPS-antibody complex.\nUse tube #3 (the “Max” tube) to measure the maximal oxidative burst of patient’s neutrophils in response to an excess of endotoxin.\nUse tube #4 (the “LPS” tube) as a source of exogenous endotoxin.\nUse tube #5 (“Aliquot” tube) for blood storage.\nNOTE: Duplicates of tubes #1, #2 and #3 are provided for a total of 8 tubes to be used for each blood sample being tested (the EA reagent bottle and quality control test can be used for all the tests contained in a pouch).\nCollect patient blood samples in sterile tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant. Store blood samples at room temperature before running the EA test.\nBefore starting the test, turn on the chemiluminometer and incubator shaker. Warm the incubator to the temperature of 37 °C.\nIdeally, start processing the sample within 30 min from blood collection.\n2. Endotoxin Activity Assay\nPrepare the EA test tubes for each patient’s blood sample you need to test. Put the tubes in tube racks. Then remove the caps.",
    "Using a combipipette, pipette a 1 mL volume of the EA reagent from the bottle into tubes #1 (Control tube), #2 (Sample tube) and #3 (Max tube), each one in duplicate.\nNOTE: Pipette down the side of the tube to avoid solution splashing back up.\nMix the patient blood sample by gently inverting the blood collection tube for 20 times. Then, pipette 0.5 mL of patient blood into tube #4 (LPS max tube) and tube #5 (Aliquot tube). Vortex tube #4 for 10 s.\nPut the tube racks with all the EA test tubes in the incubator shaker. Close the lid and incubate for 10 min at the temperature of 37°C.\nOpen the lid and remove the tube racks from the incubator shaker. Vortex tube #5 (Aliquot tube). Using a sterile tip, pipette 40 µL of blood into tubes #1 and #2, in duplicate.\nVortex tube #4 (LPS tube). Using the same pipette tip, pipette 40 µL of blood from tube #4 into tube #3 (Max tube), in duplicate.\nVortex the six final test tubes (#1, #2, #3, and respective duplicates), then place them back into their racks.\nNOTE: Ensure that all the tubes are vortexed for the same amount of time.\nPut the tube racks back into the incubating shaker and close the lid. Set the incubating shaker at 100 rpm, then start the motion for 14 min.\nInsert the EA labeled chipcard in the chemiluminometer and press start. After the 14 min incubation, follow the instructions displayed on the chemiluminometer to read the EA tubes in the correct order.",
    "Gently vortex each tube for 10 s before placing it onto the sample holder of the chemiluminometer. Open the sample drawer and place tube #1 in the sample holder. Then, close the sample drawer and wait for the Relative Light Unit (RLU) reading.\nRepeat step 2.10 for tube 2 and tube 3.\nRepeat step 2.10 for duplicate tubes 1, 2, and 3.\nNOTE: Try to vortex all tubes for the same amount of time during steps 2.10–2.12.\nAfter all the tubes have been processed, note that the EA results will be calculated and printed automatically. Levels are expressed as EA units and represent the mean of duplicate determinations from the same samples.\nRepeat steps 2.2 to 2.13 for every blood sample that needs to be tested.\nOnce the assay has been completed, store the remaining test tubes and EA reagents at 2–8 °C for up to 30 days.\nSubscription Required.
