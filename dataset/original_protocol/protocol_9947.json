Lift the sash and turn on the blower for 15 min.\nWipe all items to be used in the biosafety cabinet with 70% ethanol prior to putting the items into the sterilized cabinet.\nClean gloves or bare hands with 70% ethanol before working in the biosafety cabinet.\nWork in the center of the biosafety cabinet, away from the blower.\nUse unopened bottles of autoclaved sterile 10 mM MgCl2 and ultrapure H2O for experiments. Put bottles in the biosafety cabinet and only open them in the sterilized biosafety cabinet, not on the benchtop.\nUse dedicated glass pipettes and pipette tips for work in the sterilized biosafety cabinet. Ensure that these are only opened in the biosafety cabinet, never on the benchtop.\nAfter use of the biosafety cabinet, autoclave all waste (except bleach waste) and wipe down the surface with 70% ethanol.\n2. Preparation of plant media\nWeigh out and dissolve 0.5x MS basal salts in ultrapure H2O. Weigh out 0.8% bacto agar and then add to dissolved 0.5x MS.\nAutoclave and allow the media to cool in 50 ˚C water bath for 1 h prior to pouring or pipetting.\nTo ensure that plates are not overfilled, mark polystyrene disposable sterile 100 x 25 mm plates to a fill level of 40 mL. Pour media into 100 x 25 mm sterile plates in a sterilized biosafety cabinet.\n3. Preparation of plant materials and growth conditions\nPlace tomato seeds in a 2.2 mL microcentrifuge tube and add 2.0 mL of 50% bleach solution.",

Preparation of King's B23 (KB) media\nFill beaker with 500 mL of ultrapure H2O and stir on a stir plate.\nCompletely dissolve 20 g of bacto peptone, 1.5 g of anhydrous K2HPO4, and 12.5 mL of glycerol in a beaker with ultrapure H2O.\nPour the dissolved mixture into a 1 L graduated cylinder and bring up to a 1 L final volume with ultrapure H2O.\nPour the broth back into the beaker and stir until mixed.\nWeigh out 7.5 g of bacto agar into two 500 mL glass bottles and add 500 mL of KB broth from step 4.4 into each bottle. Autoclave for 20 min.\nRemove the bottles from the autoclave and swirl gently to distribute the agar.\nTransfer the bottles to a 50 ˚C water bath for 1 h.\nAfter 1 h, transfer the bottle to the biosafety cabinet and under aseptic conditions, add 1,600 µL of sterile 1 M MgSO4, and appropriate antibiotics to the media.\n\tNOTE: For rifampicin resistant strains PstDC3000 and Pst19, use rifampicin dissolved in dimethylformamide at a final concentration of 50 µg/mL. Use cycloheximide dissolved in ethanol at a final concentration of 50 µg/mL to prevent fungal growth on the plates.\nSwirl the media gently to mix and then pour to cover the bottom of the plates.",
    "Allow at least 1 h for the plates to solidify before storing them upside down at 4 ˚C.\n5. Maintenance of bacterial strains and culture conditions\nMaintain a glycerol stock from single colony of bacteria as 1 mL of saturated bacterial culture and 333 µL of sterile 80% glycerol at -80 ˚C.\nPatch bacteria (i.e., Pst19) from a glycerol stock onto KB agar with appropriate antibiotics (section 4).\nAllow the bacteria to recover for 2 days at 28 ˚C before streaking fresh bacteria onto selective KB agar using a flat, sterile toothpick.\nStreak fresh bacteria from the glycerol stock onto appropriate selective KB agar using a flat, sterile toothpick.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the patched glycerol stock is not more than 2 weeks old.\nFor PstDC3000, incubate the KB plate at 28 ˚C for 24 h prior to using bacteria in the flood experiment.\nFor Pst19, incubate the KB plate at 28 ˚C for 48 h prior to using bacteria in the flood experiment.\n6.

Add the 1/10 stock of surfactant to the last serial dilution (OD600 = 0.005) to a final concentration of 0.015% and swirl well to mix.\n8. Tomato seedling flood method\nTake the plates with the 10-day-old seedlings out of the growth chamber and put in the biosafety cabinet to prepare the plates for flooding.\nRemove the surgical tape from two plates.\nSet a timer for 3 min. Measure 6 mL of final inoculum (Pst19 OD600 = 0.0075 [section 6] or PstDC3000 OD600 = 0.005 [section 7]) and transfer 6 mL of inoculum to each plate with the 10-day-old seedlings.\nGently push the seedlings down into the inoculum with a sterile pipette tip. Start the timer.",
    "Hold one plate in each hand. Tilt the front of the plate down to accumulate inoculum and mainly submerge the cotyledons and leaves of the seedlings.\nSwish side to side 5–7x and then tip the plates back to cover the roots and the whole plate.\nTilt the plates down again to submerge the cotyledons and leaves, and repeat for a total of 3 min.\nPour the inoculum off the plates, set the plates down on a flat surface and then pour off any residual inoculum a second time.\nRewrap the plates with surgical tape and repeat steps 8.2–8.8 for any remaining plates.\nRe-incubate the plates in the growth chamber (see step 3.11 NOTE) after all plates have been flooded.\nPhenotype after 7–10 days for PstDC3000 or 10–14 days for Pst19 (section 11). If carrying out bacterial growth assays, collect leaf tissue after 4 days (sections 9 and 10) and then phenotype (section 11). Alternatively, perform phenotypic analysis and bacterial growth assays on separate sets of plants.\n9. Surface sterilization of cotyledons for bacterial growth assay\nFour days after flooding and re-incubating the seedlings in the growth chamber (section 8), remove the plates with the tomato seedlings from the growth chamber.\nNumber the individual seedlings on the bottom exterior of the plate where the seedling attaches to the plate for each genotype.\nLabel sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with the individual seedling numbers and use clean forceps to drop one 3 mm sterile borosilicate bead into each tube for use with a bead beater. (See NOTE in step 10.1.)\nPipette 200 µL of 10 mM MgCl2 into each tube and close tubes.\nPrepare 70% ethanol and pour 100 mL into a clean beaker. Pour 100 mL of sterile ultrapure H2O into a separate, clean beaker.",

Open the plate slightly to allow aseptic removal of one cotyledon with the clean forceps.\nPinch the petiole at the base of the cotyledon to remove a leaf and drop into the beaker with 70% ethanol to surface-sterilize for 10 s. Rinse the cotyledon in ultrapure H2O for 10 s.\nPlace the cotyledon on a paper towel and blot dry with delicate science wipes.\nIndividually weigh each cotyledon after surface sterilization and blotting, and record the weight.\nPlace the cotyledon in a previously prepared 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (from steps 9.3 and 9.4) labelled with the corresponding genotype and individual number.\nReseal the plates with sterile tape and re-incubate the seedlings in the growth chamber (see step 3.11 NOTE).\n10. Bacterial growth assay\nUsing samples from step 9.10, homogenize the tissue using the bead beater in 10 mM MgCl2 for 1–2 min. If the tissue is not adequately macerated, homogenize again.\n\tNOTE: Many manufacturers produce bead beater homogenizers. The number and type of beads, as well as the homogenization time and speed (if programmable) should be optimized for each type of homogenizer. Ensure that the samples do not overheat during homogenization.\nAdd 800 µL of 10 mM MgCl2 to each tube containing macerated tissue from step 10.1 and invert several times to mix.\nPrepare serial dilutions for each sample in 10 mM MgCl2 in 96 well plate (100, 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5) using a multichannel pipette (Figure 2A).\nPipette 5 µL from each dilution series using a multichannel pipette onto a KB agar plate (150 mm x 15 mm) with cycloheximide and appropriate selection for the bacterial strain of interest (see step 4.8 NOTE). Let the plates dry completely.",
    "Incubate the plate upside down at 28 ˚C for 36 h, then visualize (Figure 2B) the colonies on the plates using a dissecting microscope to determine if the colonies are large enough to count.\n\tNOTE: If the colonies are not large enough, re-incubate the plates and recheck the size of the colonies every few hours. Typically, the colonies are countable ~36–48 h after incubation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60805/60805fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Serial dilutions for seedling bacterial growth assays.

Sample calculations demonstrate how to normalize bacterial counts and determine log bacterial growth.\nFor wild accessions and other lines with complex genetic backgrounds, correlate the level of bacterial growth in individual seedlings with their phenotype as described in section 11.\n11. Phenotyping for resistance\nRemove the plates from the growth chamber and phenotype individual seedlings for death (due to disease) or survival (due to resistance) after 7–14 days.\nPhenotype plants infected with a highly virulent strain such as PstDC3000 earlier, at 7–10 days after flood inoculation.\nPhenotype plants infected with Pst19 at 10–14 days after flood inoculation.\nDetermine a scoring system based on the range of resistance phenotypes observed. Record binary phenotypes for cultivars, isogenic lines, and wild accessions with consistent, strong to intermediate resistance phenotypes (Figure 4A, 4B).\nIf the seedling displays new growth from the apical meristem within the time frame for phenotyping, count it as a survival. If the seedling has a brown apical meristem and displays no new, green vegetative growth, count it as a death (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60805/60805fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Schematic representation of a tomato seedling.

    "Figure 4: Schematic representation of expected phenotypes for seedling resistance and death in various genetic backgrounds. (A) Seedlings of Rio Grande-PtoR and the near-isogenic cultivar Rio Grande-PtoS are displayed 7 days after flooding with PstDC3000 (OD600 = 0.005) + 0.015% surfactant. Rio Grande-PtoR displays consistent resistance, and Rio Grande-PtoS displays consistent susceptibility to infection with PstDC3000. These lines give rise to discrete and binary phenotypes. (B) Seedlings of a wild accession, such as Solanum neorickii LA1329, are shown 10 days after flooding with Pst19 (OD600 = 0.0075) + 0.015% surfactant. Seedlings display phenotypic variability but were recorded as binary phenotypes. The amount of phenotypic variability and the method of phenotyping (binary resistance or resistance spectrum) will depend on the particular accession tested. (C) Mapping populations generated by outcrossing wild accessions to susceptible cultivars may display a wider spectrum of phenotypes in F2 segregating populations. In this case, it may be most appropriate to record seedling phenotypes on a spectrum. Highly susceptible seedlings from a mapping population may be phenotyped for death as early as day 7 when flooded with Pst19, and typically show a brown apical meristem, no to very little extension of the epicotyl, and no new, green vegetative growth. The apical meristem of susceptible seedlings may stay green or very light brown for more time, and there may be some extension of the epicotyl and very little vegetative growth, which turns brown and arrests by day 10. Individual seedlings can be phenotyped for resistance based on the amount of new and ongoing vegetative growth by day 14. Seedlings can then be grouped based on the phenotypes described above into different categories of resistance such as weak, medium, or strong resistance.
