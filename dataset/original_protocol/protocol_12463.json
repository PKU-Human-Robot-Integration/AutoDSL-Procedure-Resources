    "All of the experiments should be performed according to the guidance and protocols established by local Animal Care and Use Committees.\n1. Apparatus Setting",
    "The apparatus for the conditioning and context test is a square chamber with an electrifiable grid floor, a sound source, and a calibrated shock generator. Various chamber sizes are used, with dimensions varying from 54 cm x 27 cm x 30 cm 21 to 25 cm x 35 cm x 30 cm 22. In this protocol, the apparatus consists of an acrylic square chamber (33 cm x 25 cm x 28 cm; transparent in the front and rear walls; white in the side walls) with metal grids (0.2 cm diameter, spaced 0.5 cm apart) covered by a transparent acrylic lid (Figure 1A). It is necessary to place the chamber on a white acrylic floor (Figure 1B) to analyze the behavior of black, agouti, or dilute brown mice because an image analyzing system with the ImageFZ software program (available for free download, see Table of materials/reagents) distinguishes a dark subject from a white background in each captured video image. Albino mice also can be tested using black metal grids and a black acrylic floor (Figure 1B). Light-emitting diode (LED) lights are attached to the ceiling above the apparatus. The grid floor is illuminated at 100 lux by the LED lights. A speaker connected to a white noise/tone generator (Figure 1C) is mounted on a ceiling 5 cm above the lid to present an auditory cue (a white noise, 55 dB) as a conditioned stimulus (CS). The grids are wired to a shock generator (Figure 1C) to deliver an electric footshock as the unconditioned stimulus (US). The test chamber is placed in a soundproof room (170 cm x 210 cm x 200 cm) (Figure 1D) to minimize external noise during the tests.",
    "This condition also prevents the mice that are not currently being subjected to a test from hearing an auditory cue or the vocalization of the test mice.",
    "The apparatus for the cued test is composed of a chamber that has different properties from the conditioning chamber, providing a new context. It is imperative to change the sensory cues as much as possible so that the mouse perceives the novel context as being unrelated to the conditioning chamber. Generally, a differently shaped box or a triangular chamber is used. In addition, different lighting and/or olfactory cues are also provided to the mouse. In this protocol, the apparatus is an acrylic triangular chamber (33 cm x 29 cm x 32 cm; white in each side wall) with a flat, white floor for black, agouti, or dilute brown mice or a flat, black floor for albino mice, covered with a transparent acrylic lid (Figure 1E). LED lights are attached to the ceiling above the apparatus. The illumination level of the floor is set at 30 lux. A speaker is mounted on the ceiling 5 cm above the lid to present an auditory cue that is the same as that provided to the mice at the time of conditioning. The triangular chamber is located in a different soundproof room from the room in which the conditioning and context test are performed.",
    "Each chamber is equipped with a ceiling-mounted Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera connecting to a Windows computer via quad video splitter and USB image capture device to monitor the mouse’s behavior, and images of the apparatus and the mouse are captured and analyzed by the application software program ImageFZ (see Protocol 6). The white noise and footshock generators are automatically controlled by the ImageFZ software program; the start time and duration of the white noise and footshock must be written into a text file (see a sample text file ’simple-cond’ shown in the video for the details on how the parameters are written in the file), which is read into the application.\nBefore each test begins, the acrylic walls and floors are wiped with a towel soaked in super hypochlorous water (pH 6-7), and the grids are cleaned with 70% ethanol to prevent a bias based on olfactory cues. The grids are wiped with ethanol instead of super hypochlorous water to ensure that the grids do not lessen their electrical conductivity due to rust.\n2. Animal Preparation\nGenerally, two to four mice are housed per cage in a temperature-controlled holding room (23±2 °C) with a 12 hr light/dark cycle (e.g. lights on at 7:00 AM).\nIn this protocol, to reduce possible influences of cage transportation on behavior and to adapt the mice to the experimental environment, the cages containing the mice are transferred from the animal holding room into a soundproof waiting room adjacent to a soundproof testing room at least 30 min before each test begins.",
    "All of the experiments (Figure 2A) should be performed during the same time period in the light or dark phase each day to minimize the behavioral variations produced by testing at different times23,24. In this protocol, all of the experiments are conducted between 1 hr after the onset of the light phase and 1 hr before the onset of the dark phase (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM in the light phase). If only one apparatus is available, mice of each genotype should be tested in a counterbalanced order to reduce potential effects of the experimental time and the testing order of subjects on behavioral performance. ImageFZ can control a maximum of 4 apparatuses. Testing 4 mice simultaneously by using 4 apparatuses in a counterbalanced order allows the researcher to save time and reduces the possible effects of the experimental parameters on mouse behavior.\n3. Conditioning",
    "Mice are placed in the conditioning chamber, and the mice are typically allowed to freely explore the chamber for 120 sec. Thereafter, the auditory cue, such as a white noise, tone, and auditory clicker, is presented as a CS for 30 sec, and a 0.1-0.8 mA footshock is given to the mice as a US during the last 2 sec of the sound. The presentation of the CS-US paring is repeated to strengthen the association. The mice are left in the chamber for a length of time after the last presentation to further establish the association between the context of the chamber and the aversive experience. In this protocol, after 120 sec of free exploration, an auditory cue (white noise, 55 dB) is presented for 30 sec, and a 0.3 mA footshock is delivered continuously during the last 2 sec of the white noise. After 90 sec, the pairing of the auditory cue with the footshock is given to the subjects again. The presentation of CS-US repeats three times per session (120, 240, and 360 sec after the beginning of the conditioning) (Figure 2B). Following the final footshock, the mice are left undisturbed in the chambers for 90 sec.\nBefore the conditioning session begins, run the ImageFZ application software program, select the plug-in menu ‘FZ Conditioning and FZ Online (4 chamber)’, and set the parameter values step-by-step as follows.\n\t\nStep 1: Project ID. Specify a folder where you want to store your data files.\nStep 2: Session Name. Type any words, e.g. the experimental date, in the ’Session’ box, and select a reference text file in which the start time and duration of the white noise and footshock are written, in the ‘Reference’ box. A sample text file is shown in the video.",
    "Step 3: Parameter Settings. Enter parameter values in each box as follows.\n\t\t\nRate (frame/sec): frame rate of image acquisition, e.g. 1 frame/sec.\nDuration (sec): in the case of conditioning, the total duration is 480 sec.\nBin duration (sec): e.g. 60 sec; the data are analyzed in each block of 60 sec.\nSubject size - min (pixels): ImageFZ detects a mouse and noise as black particles (some mass of pixels) in a white background in each image. When the area of the black particle (pixels) is less than the ‘Subject size – min (pixels)’ value (e.g. 100 pixels), the particles are regarded as noise and are excluded from the image analysis.\nSubject size - max (pixels): when the sizes of the black particles are more than the size of the ‘Subject size – max (pixels)’ value, the particles are excluded from the analysis.\nFrame size - width/height (cm): chamber dimension, i.e. 33 cm wide and 25 cm high.\nFreezing criterion (pixels): e.g. 30 pixels, see the details in Protocol 6.\nFreezing duration - min (sec): e.g. 2 sec; when no mouse movement is detected for only less than 2 sec, its behavior is not counted as ‘freezing’.\nShock rate (frame/sec): see the details in Protocol 6.\nStep 4: Subject ID. Enter the subject identification.\nStep 5: Camera Settings. Control the brightness and contrast of the captured image.\nStep 6: Threshold Settings. Adjust the threshold values to detect a black mouse as black pixels in a white background in each image and to judge mouse behavior as ‘freezing’ or ‘non-freezing’ (see the details in Protocol 6). To analyze an albino mouse, click on the checkbox ‘invert mode’, and adjust the threshold values appropriately.",
    "Step 7: Set Cage Field. Specify the field of each chamber that you want to capture. After clicking the rectangle button in the toolbox, draw a rectangle around the floor of the chamber on the live image window. Next, select the chamber number and click the ‘Set’ button. Finally, click the ‘Complete’ button.\nAfter the parameter settings are set, a preparatory test should be given using practice mice (mice not used as subjects) before the first test of the day to determine whether the image analyzing system and white noise/shock generators work without problems.\nMove a home cage containing practice mice to the soundproof testing room from the adjacent waiting room, and place each mouse in the conditioning chamber. Immediately after placing the mice in the chamber, click the start button of ImageFZ. The application software will present auditory cues and/or electric footshocks to the mice in the order that you specify in a reference file.\nAfter 480 sec has elapsed, return the mice to their home cage and return the cage to the shelf in the holding room.\nClean the chambers carefully. Then, click ‘Next Analysis’ button, and repeat steps 3.2.4-3.6 for the test mice.\nImageFZ stores live and trace images in the TIFF format. The program allows us to perform an offline analysis to reanalyze the images using modified parameter values. If you conduct an offline analysis, select the plug-in menu ‘Fear Conditioning and FZ Offline’ and select the data folder that you want to reanalyze. Thereafter, input the parameter values again, and click the ‘Complete’ button.\n4. Context Test",
    "After the conditioning session has been completed, the mice are returned to the same conditioning chamber and scored for freezing behavior to measure contextually conditioned fear (context test). A delay interval between the conditioning and the context test has been generally set at 24 hr. In this protocol, to assess recent memory and remote memory (measured by the test 1 day and more than 28 days after conditioning, respectively)25, the mice are subjected to the context test approximately 24 hr and 30 days after the conditioning session. The mice are placed in the conditioning chamber and are allowed to freely explore the chamber for 300 sec without CS and US presentations (Figure 2C).\nRun the ImageFZ software program and set the application software’s parameter values in the same manner as in the conditioning (see section 3.2.3); however, modify the duration time of this test to 300 sec and select a reference text file for the context test. After changing the setting, a preparatory test should be given using practice mice to check the ImageFZ system.\nPlace each mouse into the conditioning chamber and click the start button. After 300 sec has elapsed, return the mice into their home cage, and leave the cage undisturbed until the cued test begins.\nClean the chambers. Then, click ‘Next Analysis’ button, and repeat steps 4.3-4.4 in the test mice.\n5. Cued Test",
    "Cued test is conducted on the same day of the context test or on the next day. In this test, mice are placed into another testing chamber with very different properties, providing a new context that is unrelated to the conditioning chamber for 3 min. At the end of the first 3 min, the auditory cue that is presented at the time of conditioning is given to mice for 3 min in the novel context environment. In this protocol, cued test is performed a few hours after the context test. Mice are allowed to explore the triangular chamber for 360 sec. In the first 3 min, neither a CS nor US is presented, and thereafter, a CS (a 55 dB white noise) is presented for the last 3 min.\nRun the ImageFZ software program and set the parameter values in the same way as in conditioning, except modify the duration time of the test to 360 sec and select a reference text file for the cued test. After adjusting the setting, a preparatory test should be given using practice mice to check the ImageFZ system.\nPlace each mouse into the triangular chamber and click the start button. After 360 sec has elapsed, return the mice to their home cage and return the cage to the shelf of the holding room.\nClean the chambers. Then, click the ‘Next Analysis’ button and repeat steps 5.3-5.4 in the test mice.\nTo further test remote memory, repeat the Protocols 4-5 about 30 days after the conditioning session (Figure 2A).\n6. Image Analysis",
    "Perform data acquisition and analysis automatically using ImageFZ. This application software program is based on the public domain ImageJ program (developed by Wayne Rasband at the National Institutes of Health and available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), modified by Tsuyoshi Miyakawa (ImageFZ application software, available for free download, see Table of materials/reagents).\nFor all experiments, capture images at a given frame rate (e.g. 1 fps) with ImageFZ using a USB video capture device, including a video camera. To measure the distance traveled from the consecutive images, adjust the ‘threshold min’ value of the program (e.g. 80 pixels), which is set to segment the images into a black particle (a mouse) and a white background. The distance traveled is calculated from the distance between each set of the x-y coordinates for the center of gravity of the particle in the consecutive images.",
    "To measure the freezing behavior from the consecutive images, adjust the ‘threshold min (xor)’ value of the program (e.g. 160 pixels), which is set to segment the images into a black particle (mouse) and background, and then calculate the amount of area (pixels) of nonoverlapping regions between particles of each pair of consecutive images. Adjust the value using the slider of the threshold tool until the black particle in each image matches the shape of the entire body of the mouse excluding the tail. If the area of the nonoverlapping region is below the ‘freezing criterion’ value (e.g. 30 pixels), the behavior is considered to be ‘freezing’ (Figure 3), which is generally defined as the complete absence of any movement except for respiration and heartbeat. When the area exceeds this value, the behavior is considered to be ‘non-freezing’ (Figure 3). The judgment should be made based on the definition of freezing. Mice sometimes exhibit a subtle movement and a momentary immobility, which might not be considered as a freezing behavior that reflects fear. The immobility that lasts for a short time (e.g. less than 2 sec), which is likely different from the manifestation of fear, can be excluded from the analysis by setting the time threshold of freezing. To set the time threshold, input ‘Freezing duration – min (sec)’ value (e.g. 2 sec).",
    "The ImageFZ program automatically calculates the distance traveled (cm) and the percentage of freezing. The results are saved in text files, and live and trace images are stored in a TIFF format. To measure the distance traveled (cm) as an index of electric footshock sensitivity, the ImageFZ program also acquires images at a high frame rate (e.g. 4 fps) for 6 sec, measured from 2 sec before the delivery of a 2 sec footshock until 2 sec after footshock during online analysis. To set the frame rate for image capture before, during, and after footshock, input a value in the ‘Shock rate (frame/sec)’ box. After the online analysis, perform offline analysis by selecting a plug-in menu ‘FZ Shock Offline’ to obtain the data for the distance traveled.\nThe parameter values of the ImageFZ program should be optimized to generate results similar to those obtained by human observers in preparatory tests. For manual scoring, the freezing behavior is continuously measured using a stopwatch and an event-recording program or an instantaneous time-sampling procedure every 3-10 sec, during analysis using ImageFZ software. Two observers typically conduct the behavioral observation. To adjust the parameter values of the ImageFZ program to ensure that the outcomes of the image analysis are consistent with those of human observers, perform an offline analysis of the ImageFZ program, modifying the ‘threshold min (xor)’ and ‘freezing criterion’ values. To perform the offline analysis, select the plug-in menu ‘FZ Offline’ and input any parameter values.\n7. Troubleshooting\nHow can the ImageFZ program be obtained and installed?",
    "The ImageFZ program is available for free download from our website (see Table of materials/reagents), and runs on a Windows computer. Download the zip folder for ImageFZ and install the software on your computer. See the ‘readme.txt’ file for the installation details and follow the step-by-step instructions.\nWhy is the error message ‘Error setting capture device’ displayed?\n\tCheck the connection of the camera cable and your driver installation of the USB image capture device. If there is no problem with the settings, then the ImageFZ software might not work with your image capture device. See the ‘readme.txt’ file concerning the appropriate device to use with ImageFZ software.\nImageFZ cannot detect the entire body of the mouse as a particle.\n\tSet the value of ‘threshold min’ and/or ‘threshold min (xor)’ lower than the current value. If ImageFZ cannot detect the mouse in a specific place, e.g. the corner of a test chamber, then insufficient testing conditions, such as a uniformly illuminated floor or a slightly contrasting difference between the mouse and the background, might exist. To solve this problem, adjust the parameter values (e.g. brightness and contrast of the live image and threshold values) of ImageFZ, control the number and position of lights, or use a white background for a black mouse.\nImage capturing at a high frame rate slows down the computer during online analysis.\n\tSet the frame rate to a value lower than the current rate, and perform online analysis. The ImageFZ analysis, through image acquisition at 1 fps, is sufficient for accurately measuring freezing, as shown in the representative results section.\nThe results of the ImageFZ analysis do not agree with those of human scoring.",
    "Examine the stored image and judgment result files. If ImageFZ overestimates freezing, set the ‘freezing criterion’ to a value lower than the current value, and perform offline analysis. If ImageFZ underestimates freezing, set the ‘freezing criterion’ to a value higher than the current value.\nIn optogenetical and in vivo electrophysiological experiments, the fiber cable attached to the head of the mouse interferes with the judgment of freezing.\n\tCoat the cables in white for a black mouse, and change the position and angle of the camera until the cables are not detected.\nWhat is needed for the offline analysis?\n\tCreate a folder named ‘Image_FZ’ in the root directory of the ImageFZ program. In this folder, create the subfolders ‘Images’ and ‘Sessions’. Move an 8 bit gray-scale image to the ‘Images’ folder, and create a text file in which the image file name is written in the ‘Sessions’ folder. Thereafter, run the ImageFZ offline analysis, and follow the instructions of the program."
