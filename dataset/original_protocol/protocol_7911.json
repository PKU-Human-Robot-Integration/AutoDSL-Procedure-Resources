    "All animal procedures were performed with approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC A334818).\n1. Calibration of the force transducer\nEnsure that the computer is properly connected to the USB-6009 multifunctional I/O data acquisition (DAQ) device, which in turn should be connected to the force transducer.\n\tNOTE: Other rat strains and species may require a different load-cell force transducer as higher forces are to be expected 44.\nAttach a custom clamp fashioned from a modified surgical hemostat to the force transducer that is mounted to a vacuum base adjustable lever arm.\n\tNOTE: The custom-made clamp consists of a surgical hemostat modified with a tightening screw that allows for adjustment of the tension (Figure 1).\nPosition the custom-made acrylic glass testing platform, which contains two wooden blocks for fixation of the rat hind limb, on the table.\n\tNOTE: Other materials such as urethane can also be used instead of wood as long as the K-wires are able to penetrate and fixate.\nAttach the clamp, force transducer and adjustable lever arm combination vertically to the testing platform using its vacuum base.\nFasten a hook or loop to the clamp for the calibration weights.\nTurn on the computer and open the software (e.g., LabVIEW).\nOnce the software is opened, start the custom-made virtual instrument (VI) for ITF measurement (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Figure 2 contains the LabVIEW code in a VI snippet. This VI snippet can be dragged onto the block diagram in LabVIEW. It will automatically be transformed into a graphical code. For this experiment the sampling rate was set at 2000 Hz with 25 samples to read for each iteration.\nRun the VI by pressing the white arrow in the left upper corner and select New calibration. A new window will open.",
    "Start the calibration process with zero weight (only the clamp with an attached hook or loop) and press OK.\nConsecutively, add 10, 20, 30 and 50 grams of weight and press OK in between each weight measurement.\nOnce all five measurements are collected, click on Process.\nOnly accept the values if the graph on the VI displays a positive linear curve (Figure 3).\nReposition the clamp, force transducer and adjustable lever arm combination horizontally on the testing platform. This will be the position used for measuring the ITF.\nClick on Zero and the window will automatically close.\n2. Animal subjects\nUse male Lewis rats weighing between 300-500 g.\n\tNOTE: For comparison of nerve regeneration, it is imperative to use the same rat strain in both the control and experimental groups, since weight and incidence of autotomy are strain dependent and can tremendously influence the results of the ITF10,32,45,46,47.\n3. Surgical preparation\nPrepare all required surgical instruments prior to surgery (Table of Materials).\nWeigh the animals to determine the required amount of anesthesia.\nInduce anesthesia by placing the rat in a chamber gassed with 3% isoflurane in oxygen.\nDeeply anesthetize the rat using a cocktail of ten-parts ketamine (100 mg/mL) and one-part xylazine (100 mg/mL) at a dosage of 1 mL/kg body weight via an intraperitoneal injection. Monitor the depth of anesthesia based on the response to a toe pinch and by observing the respiratory rate.\nApproximately 30 minutes after the initial dosage of the ketamine/xylazine cocktail, administer a supplementary dose of 0.3-0.6 mL/kg body weight of only ketamine (100 mg/mL) intraperitoneally to maintain adequate anesthesia throughout the entire procedure, which is defined as a low respiratory rate and an absent response to a toe pinch.",
    "CAUTION: It is important to meticulously administer the required anesthesia as an overdose cannot be counteracted.\nCarefully shave the hind limbs of the rat using electric clippers.\nPlace the rat in prone position on a heating pad to maintain the body temperature at 37 °C. Optionally, the body temperature can be monitored using a rectal thermometer.\nInject 5 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) subcutaneously into the loose skin over the neck of the rat to preserve an adequate hydration status throughout the procedure.\nDue to the non-survival nature of this procedure, the surgical field and instruments do not require to be sterile. The surgeon should use personal protective equipment (PPE) and surgical loupes are advised for proper visualization of the anatomical structures.\n4. Surgical approach to the common peroneal nerve\nPlace the rat in either the right or left lateral recumbent position depending on which side will be measured first.\nCreate a 2-3 cm incision in the skin of the posterolateral thigh parallel to the femur starting at the greater trochanter using a surgical no. 15 blade.\nIdentify the plane between the biceps femoris muscle and the gluteus maximus and vastus lateralis muscles and perform a blunt dissection using tenotomy scissors to separate these muscles and expose the underlying sciatic nerve.\nLocate the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve and place a retractor to acquire better access. The three branches of the sciatic nerve include the common peroneal nerve, the tibialis nerve and the sural nerve.\nIsolate the common peroneal nerve branch (usually the most ventral branch) of the sciatic nerve using a curved microsurgical forceps.\n\t​NOTE: In case of uncertainty, gently stimulate the isolated nerve with a surgical nerve stimulator and observe the motor response. Stimulation of the common peroneal nerve results in dorsiflexion of the paw.",
    "5. Dissection of the distal tibialis anterior muscle tendon\nIn order to expose the TA muscle and its insertion, incise the skin at the anterolateral aspect of the lower leg, starting at the knee joint and descending to the mediodorsal side of the hind paw.\nDissect the distal TA muscle tendon from the surrounding tissue using a scalpel with a surgical blade no. 15.\nUsing a mosquito forceps, bluntly dissect the TA muscle tendon towards the insertion and cut the tendon as distal as possible. Leave the proximal TA muscle undisturbed, preserving the neurovascular pedicle.\n\t​NOTE: Regularly (approximately every 5 minutes), moist the TA muscle with heated 0.9% NaCl (37 °C) to prevent cooling and desiccation.\n6. Isometric tetanic force measurement\nConnect the bipolar electrode cables and the ground cable according to their color to a bipolar stimulator device.\nAttach the other end of the bipolar electrode cables to a subminiature electrode.\n\tNOTE: The reference electrode (red, anode) should be placed distal and the active electrode (black, cathode) proximal.\nTransfer the animal together with the heating pad to the testing platform.\nFixate the hind limb of the rat to the wooden block using two 1 mm Kirschner wires through the ankle and the lateral condyle of the distal femur avoiding the posterior aspect of the knee.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid vascular damage to the popliteal artery and vein which are located dorsally to the femur condyle.\nAttach a holder with a custom clamp to the testing platform using its vacuum base.\nSecure the distal TA muscle tendon to the clamp attached to the force transducer.\n\tNOTE: The clamp and force transducer should be positioned parallel to the course of the TA muscle.\nPlace the retractor at the posterolateral thigh of the rat in order to access the common peroneal nerve.",
    "NOTE: The sciatic nerve and its branches should be kept moist with heated 0.9% NaCl (37 °C) to prevent cooling and desiccation.\nInsert the ground cable in the surrounding muscles (e.g., the vastus lateralis muscle).\n\tNOTE: The Grass SD9 stimulator requires a ground cable to reduce electrical artifacts. Newer stimulators might not require an extra ground cable.\nHook the common peroneal nerve to the subminiature electrode and fix its position using the holder on the platform (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: Ensure that only the common peroneal nerve is hooked to the subminiature electrode.\nOptimization of the muscle length\n\t\nTurn the bipolar stimulator device on and adjust the settings as follow: square monophasic pulse, delay 2 ms, stimulus pulse duration 0.4 ms, stimulus intensity 2 V.\n\t\tNOTE: The delay determines the time between the sync out pulse and the delivery of the leading edge of the pulse.\nSelect Parameter test and turn on Trigger collection in the VI.\nIncrease the muscle length (preload) by adjusting the lever arm attached to the force transducer.\nStart at 10 g of preload and use increments of 10 g until the maximum active muscle force is determined.\nFor each preload, apply two single twitches directly after each other using the button on the bipolar stimulator device. The output will be visible on the screen and the rat should show dorsiflexion of the paw.\n\t\tNOTE: Before stimulating the nerve, always remove any excess 0.9% NaCl surrounding the nerve using cotton tipped applicators to ensure the signal is not conducted to the surrounding tissue.\nTo stop the measurement, hit Trigger collection again in the VI.",
    "If the program automatically detects the two peak output forces click on Accept. In case the program does not automatically select these output forces, press Decline and select the peaks manually. The two peak output forces will be averaged to a mean peak output force (Figure 5).\nCalculate the active muscle force by subtracting the preload from the mean peak output force.\nWrite down the active force for each preload to visualize the trend and recognize the maximum active force (Figure 6). A spreadsheet can also be used.\nMeasurement of isometric tetanic force\n\t\nAfter determining the ideal muscle length, let the muscle rest at zero preload for 5 minutes prior to starting the tetanic muscle contractions.\nMeanwhile, switch from Parameter test to Frequency test on the VI and adjust the stimulus intensity to 10 V on the bipolar stimulator device.\nKeep the delay and stimulus pulse duration at 2 ms and 0.4 ms, respectively.\nMeasure the isometric tetanic muscle force using increasing stimulus frequencies starting at 30 Hz with increments of 30 Hz until the maximum force plateau is observed.\nClick on Trigger collection and set to the predetermined optimal muscle length.\nPress the Repeat button on the bipolar stimulator device to induce a tetanic stimulation for a maximum of 5 seconds or until a force peak is clearly observed.\n\t\tNOTE: Before stimulating the nerve, always remove any excess 0.9% NaCl surrounding the nerve using cotton tipped applicators to ensure the signal is not conducted to the surrounding tissue.\nTo collect the data, press Trigger collection again and document the maximum output force. In case the program does not automatically detect the peak maximum output force, press Decline and select the peak manually.",
    "Let the muscle rest again at zero preload for 5 minutes prior to starting the next tetanic muscle contractions.\n\t\tNOTE: Regularly (approximately every 5 min), moist the TA muscle with heated 0.9% NaCl (37 °C) to prevent cooling and desiccation.\nContinue increasing the stimulus frequency until the maximum force plateau is reached. The force plateau will be defined as the maximum isometric tetanic force.\n\t\tNOTE: After this step, remove the K-wires, staple or suture the skin and repeat the entire procedure to the contralateral hind limb, starting at step 4.\nSubscription Required.
