    "All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of South Carolina (federal assurance number: D16-00028).\n1. Defining Parameters and Calibration of the Startle Apparatus\nSet up the startle response system (see Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\t\nEnclose the startle platform in a 10 cm-thick double-walled isolation cabinet.\nCalibrate the response sensitivities using the startle calibration system.\nAttach the high-frequency loudspeaker 30 cm above the animal holder.\n\t\nMeasure and calibrate the loudspeaker using a sound level meter by placing the microphone inside the animal holder.\nAffix a white LED light (22 lux) on the wall in front of the animal holder.\n\t\nMeasure the lux presented as a visual prepulse using a light meter.\nConnect a semi-rigid plastic tube (0.64 mm diameter) to a compressed air tank via an airline regulator.\n\t\nSet the air tank to 16 psi for the presentation of tactile prestimuli.\nUse a sound level meter to measure the amount of noise being emitted by the tactile stimulus inside the tube, 2.5 cm from the end of the animal holder. If using multiple chambers, ensure that all chambers are calibrated in the same manner.\nNote: To prevent the tactile stimulus from being perceived as an acoustic stimulus, the sound of the air puff prepulse must be less than or equal to the white noise background. In the present set-up, the air puff prepulse emitted 70 db(A) inside the tube while the background white noise was also set to 70 db(A).\n2. Creation of Experimental Programs\nOpen the Startle Response System software (see Table of Materials).\nClick Definitions and Select Define Trial.\nDefine a pulse-only ASR trial.",

Protocol Structure\nUse the F344/N rat strain, the most common inbred rat strain, for assessments.\nNote: Cross-modal PPI and gap-PPI can be conducted in animals at a variety of ages, of both sexes, and regardless of hormonal status (i.e., ovariectomized, castrated, intact). Details regarding the animals used in the representative data are presented in the representative results.\nHandle the animals to allow for acclimation across a series of days prior to beginning experimentation.\nRandomize the order of animals for experimentation dependent upon the between-subjects’ factors of interest (e.g., biological sex, treatment).\nOpen the startle response system software.

Data Analysis\nCalculate an adjusted V. Max for each trial by subtracting the V. Max from the Start value.\nNote: The adjusted V. Max creates a measure of mean peak ASR amplitude.\nGraphically visualize results for the habituation session.\n\t\nPlot group means and standard errors of the mean for each trial. Regression analyses can be conducted and fit with 95% confidence intervals.\nGraphically visualize results for cross-sectional cross-modal PPI and gap-PPI.\n\t\nCalculate mean values for each ISI by averaging across the 6 trials individually for each animal.\nCalculate and graph group means and standard errors of the mean for each ISI and sensory modality.\nStatistically analyze cross-modal PPI and gap-PPI (Optional).\n\tNote: Although the precise statistical approach will be dependent upon the experimental design and research question of interest, a mixed-design repeated measures ANOVA provides one appropriate approach.\nSubscription Required.
