    "Preparation of GLDNPPlease refer to our published bio-protocols Sung et al. (2019 and 2020).Note: Stored GLDNP (in 1× PBS) can be enriched after ultracentrifugation (30,000 × g, 4 °C, and 45 min) and remove the supernatant. Setting up the AFM (see Note 1)Assemble the Nanosurf CoreAFM system according to the steps in the operating instructions of CoreAFM. The AFM equipment after assembly is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3969/bioprotoc-11-07-3969-g001.jpgFigure 1. Assembly of the Nanosurf CoreAFM system. A. The assembled Nanosurf CoreAFM system, which contains CoreAFM system, Isostage 300 controller, CoreAFM controller, and a laptop, according to the instructions. B. The CoreAFM toolset (see Note 2). C. Enlarged photo of CoreAFM in its opened configuration.Switch on the Nanosurf CoreAFM system (see Note 3).Insert a Nanosurf Dyn190AI dynamic mode cantilever in the cantilever holder, ensuring that the tip is not damaged and attaching the cantilever holder to the magnets at the bottom of the CoreAFM scan head (see Note 3).Loading GLDNP samples for AFM imagingDilute GLDNP solution in ddH2O to 1 mg/ml.Deposit 2 μl of nanoparticle sample to mica sheet (Figure 2A).Note: As a drug delivery vehicle, the precise dose-response is one of the factors that must be considered. For different samples, the solution is usually diluted from high concentration to low concentration, while the volume of the solution is continuously reduced. According to the imaging effect of AFM, the most suitable solution concentration and volume are finally selected. The concentration of GLDNP samples used for imaging in this procedure should be > 0.01 μg/ml. Dry the sample at room temperature (RT) for 2 h.Gently rinse the mica sheet with 5 μl of distilled water three times (Figure 2B).",
    "Note: First, drop distilled water gently into the middle of the mica sheet using the pipette, and then use filter paper to absorb water from the edge of the mica sheet. Since GLDNP samples are stored in PBS, the salt particles from PBS will affect the imaging effect of AFM, so the purpose of gently rinsing the mica sheet is to remove the salt in GLDNP samples. Dry the sample at RT for 2 h again.Leave the mica sheet for 30 min at RT until the sample becomes flat.Note: To judge whether a sample is dried and becomes flat, we can place the mica sheet in a vertical position, and if we observe no sign of flow from the sample spot, it generally means that the sample is flat and dried. The drying and flatness of the sample on the mica sheet will affect the imaging effect of AFM. Fix the mica sheet on the sample magnet in the center of the standard sample holder (Figure 2C).Close the CoreAFM scan head lid, and the three scan head feet will align with the corresponding sample stage pillars.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3969/bioprotoc-11-07-3969-g002.jpgFigure 2.

    "In the CoreAFM control software, open the Laser Alignment dialog (Figure 3A) and switch the CoreAFM to the top view camera (Figure 3B) using the Camera selector (Figure 3C).Note: The Laser Alignment dialog displays the current position of the AFM laser spot on the detector and the used laser power. The dialog is opened by clicking the “Laser Align” button in the Preparation group of the Acquisition tab. Use the laser alignment tool that came with the CoreAFM system to turn the screws in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction (Figure 3C). An optimally aligned laser would result in Figure 3A.Note: CoreAFM system comes with 4 holes in the scan head’s top cover that provide access to the laser and detector alignment screws that change different aspects of the laser beam’s optical pathway (Figure 3C). Open the scan head lid to an angle of approximately 30°, and you should now see a red laser spot somewhere on the sample holder or sample holder platform (Figure 3C). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3969/bioprotoc-11-07-3969-g003.jpgFigure 3. Checking the laser position and quality. A. The menu of CoreAFM control software application and the proofread completed Laser Alignment dialog. This graphical area shows where the deflected laser beam hits the photodiode detector. A green spot anywhere within the area enclosed by the dotted square means that the cantilever deflection detection system (consisting of laser, cantilever, and detector) is properly aligned. If the laser spot falls outside this area, it will become red, meaning that the alignment does not allow proper measurements to take place. B. Top view image of a cantilever and its chip structure. C. Physical photos of the CoreAFM scan head and the sample holder.Configuring measurement parameters of the CoreAFM (see Note 3).",
    "In the menu of CoreAFM control software, click the “Air” to select the measurement environment from the Measurement environment drop-down menu (Figure 4A).Click the “Static Force” to select the desired operating mode from the Operating mode drop-down menu (Figure 4B).Click the “ACL-A” to select the desired cantilever type from the Cantilever selector drop-down menu (Figure 4C).Click the “Frequency Sweep” button that opens the Vibration frequency search dialog. Click the “Find Vibration Frequency” button in this dialog (Figure 4D). Leave the dialog by clicking “OK”.Note: After the automatic frequency search is finished, you should see a clean resonance curve and a marker showing the vibration frequency. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3969/bioprotoc-11-07-3969-g004.jpgFigure 4. Configuring measurement parameters of the CoreAFM. A-C. Set the Measurement environment to “Air” (A), set Operating mode to “Static Force” (B) and select “ACL-A” as cantilever in the Cantilever selector (C). D. The menu of CoreAFM control software application and the proofread completed Vibration frequency search dialog.Approaching the GLDNP samples (see Note 3).Observe the distance between tip and sample in the side view (Figure 5A).While observing the tip-sample distance, click and hold the “Advance” button in the Approach group of the Acquisition tab until the tip is close enough to the sample (Figure 5B).Click the “Approach” button in the Approach group of the Acquisition tab (Figure 5B). Click the “OK” button (Figure 5C).Note: In this last step, this sample automatically approaches the tip until a given setpoint is reached. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3969/bioprotoc-11-07-3969-g005.jpgFigure 5. Approaching the GNDLN samples. A. A side view image of a cantilever. B. The “Advance” and “Approach” buttons in the Approach group of the Acquisition tab. C. When the Setpoint is reached, the “Approach done” message is displayed.Starting a measurement (see Note 3).Select the initial scan parameters in the Imaging dialog as follows (Figure 6A):Image Scan Size = 10.",
    "00 μmTime/Line = 0.78 sPoints/Line = 256Note: The other values on the master panel are the values automatically filled in by the instrument upon the finishing of probe tuning; thus, no changes of these values are needed. Click the “Start” button in the Imaging group of the Acquisition tab and start scanning for 1 min to stabilize the cantilever and adjust the instrument to surrounding environmental vibrations (Figure 6B).Note: Manually lower the “Setpoint” value until surface features start to appear on the height image. Imaging optimization can be achieved by adjusting “Setpoint”, “P-Gain”, and “I-Gain” values (see Note 4). Finally, the “Image Scan Size” can be decreased to 5.00 μm or 4.00 μm for adjusting the scan size of the image, and the “Points/Line” can be increased to 512 or even 1,024 (see Note 5) for more pixels in each image thus enhance the image quality. Once satisfied with the image quality, click the “Start” button and restart the scan with optimized parameters. After scanning, click the “Stop” button in the Imaging group of the Acquisition tab (Figure 6B).Note: Adjust the positioning screws of the CoreAFM system (see Figure 1C) so that the cantilever can be positioned in different locations of the mica sheet surface for each sample. Then click the “Prescan” button in the Imaging group of the Acquisition tab (Figure 6B). When the desired position is located by pre-scanning, click the “Start” button for scanning. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3969/bioprotoc-11-07-3969-g006.jpgFigure 6.
