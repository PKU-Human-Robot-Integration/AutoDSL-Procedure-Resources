    "All experiments outlined in this work were approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Institutional Review Board. Healthy adults (33.6 ± 3.3 years old; n=10) were enrolled in the study if they had a normal blood comprehensive metabolic panel, non-tobacco users, non-pregnant, a BMI between 20-30 kg/m2, and free of chronic medical conditions or acute illnesses. Healthy participants signed a written informed consent form prior to the start of the study.\n1. Clinical protocol and urine collection\nHave participants consume a low oxalate diet prepared by the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences Bionutrition Core for 3 days and fast overnight before collecting their urine (24-hour sample).\nThe following day, have participants return their 24-hour urine sample (pre-oxalate) before consuming an oxalate load (smoothie containing fruits and vegetables, ~8 mM oxalate). Have participants subsequently collect their urine for 24 hours (post-oxalate sample) and return their urine the following day.\nMaintain all urine samples at room temperature (RT) prior to processing as described below and shown in Figure 1.\n2. Urine Processing\nNOTE: All materials and equipment used are listed in Table of Materials.\nCAUTION: Wear personal protective equipment at all times while handling clinical samples and reagents. Specifically, gloves, face and eye shields, respiratory protection, and protective clothing.\nMeasure and record urine pH and volume. Mix thoroughly prior to adding 50 mL of urine into a labeled sterile 50 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge sample at 1200 x g for 10 min at RT using a benchtop centrifuge.\n\tNOTE: Keep the sample at RT to prevent further crystal formation as cooler temperatures can promote crystallization.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash and resuspend the pellet again with 5 mL of 100% ethanol. Centrifuge the sample at 1200 x g for 10 minutes at RT using a benchtop centrifuge.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 100% ethanol. Store the sample at -20 °C for later processing OR stain the sample as described below.\n\t​NOTE: There is no significant difference in data points (i.e., particle size/concentration) between stored or freshly stained samples.\n3. Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)\nSample Preparation\n\t\nGold nanoparticles: Use gold nanoparticles to optimize settings on the instrument. Dilute 100 nm sized gold nanoparticles 1:1000 in ultrapure water.\nHuman Urine: Dilute urine samples 20 times in water prior to staining with 5 mM Fluo-4 AM (a calcium fluorescence dye) for 30 min in the dark. Analyze the samples using NTA.\nPrepare Calcium Oxalate (CaOx) crystals as previously described29. Dilute 10 mM stock solution (14.6 mg in 10 mL of water) to 50 µM in water and stain the diluted samples using 5 mM Fluo-4 AM for 30 min in dark prior to analysis.\nCalcium Phosphate (CaP) crystals: Dilute 10 mM stock solution (50.4 mg in 10 mL of water) to 50 µM in water and stain the diluted samples using 5 mM Fluo-4 AM for 30 min in dark prior to NTA analysis.\nInstrument Set-up, Camera Settings, and Data Collection\n\tNOTE: The computer and instrument setup used for this method are shown in Figure 2.\n\t\nTurn on the computer and then the instrument. Open the software and turn on the camera.\nOnce the software window is open, click the capture icon in the top left corner on the window to start the capture mode. The camera initialization takes a few seconds.\nClean the platform by first pumping air into it using a 1 mL syringe until the platform appears clean. Gently add water to the apparatus 2-3 times using another 1 mL syringe to remove any air bubbles.",
    "​NOTE: Look for any air bubbles in the platform as well as in the tubing. It is important to not have bubbles throughout the apparatus prior to and while running samples. If bubbles are present, clean the platform again with air and water.\nOnce the platform is clean, add water to check for any contamination on the surface by viewing the camera. Next, add gold nanoparticles as a control to the sample loading pump injector to set up the instrument.\nAdjust the camera level on the screen or on the knob to the right side of the instrument until the image starts to display colored pixels and then reduce the camera level.\nThen adjust the screen to optimize the image. Left-click the mouse button on the video image. Hold the left mouse button and drag image up and down to get the entire view.\n\t\t​NOTE: The normal camera lens and filter is used to assess gold nanoparticles and unstained samples.\nSet up the infusion speed and focus the camera so that the gold nanoparticles are visible on the camera screen. Set the infusion speed to high (i.e., 500 µL/min) for initial set up to ensure the gold nanoparticles are detected. Once detected, reduce the speed to 50 µL/min.\nAdjust the camera level to visualize the particles. For unstained samples, adjust the screen gain at level 5 to achieve the camera focus, and set the camera level at 8. Once the focus is set, record the sample (i.e., 1 measurement for 60 seconds only).\n\t\t​NOTE: The focus and continuous flow speed are important for obtaining clear and sharp images of the particles for counting.\nAfter optimization, clean the apparatus again with water before assessing samples. View the camera to ensure that the tubing is clean and particles are not present.",
    "​NOTE: Wash the chamber between each sample until no particles are detected by the camera.\nTo analyze stained samples, adjust the camera to the filter position containing the suitable fluorescent filter. Load diluted and stained samples onto the sample loading pump injector and reduce the speed to 20 µL/min for analysis of the sample.\nNext adjust the screen gain and camera level as these are important parameters. For stained (fluorescent) samples, set the screen gain to 5 and the camera level at level 13.\n\t\t​NOTE: These parameters will vary based on the sample type and every sample will need to be optimized to gain focus.\nUse standard measurement to measure the samples for 5 captures per sample where one capture-duration is for 60 seconds.\nSave and store data after each measurement. The software will save image and video files for each measurement. The software provides output data (e.g., crystal size: 10 nM - 1000 nM and concentration) in both excel and pdf formats.\nCalculate the average number of nanoparticles for all 5 readings for each individual sample. Analyze the data using standard deviation or standard error of the mean and use t-tests for paired analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
