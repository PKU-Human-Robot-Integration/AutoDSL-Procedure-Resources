    "The collection of human specimens for this research was approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. All eligible patients over the age of 18 years had a diagnosis or presumed diagnosis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and were willing and able to provide informed consent. The tumor tissue from either primary or metastatic sites, in addition to ascites and pleural fluid, were obtained from consented patients at the time of care.\n1. Selection of established PDOs for viability assay\nNOTE: Typically, these organoids are within the first five passages. As described previously, ovarian cancer PDOs are formed by resuspending primary cell suspension in basement membrane extract (BME) such as Cultrex or Matrigel17 (see Table of Materials).\nPDOs should have a perceived doubling time of 24-72 h for the best efficiency of the assay. Estimate the perceived doubling time by visually determining the number of days it takes for organoids to form after passaging/plating.\n\tNOTE: In our experience, organoids that take longer than three days to form cannot be used for this growth inhibition assay.\nIdentify drugs and select a range of concentrations to test (e.g., Carboplatin, 0-50 µM, see Table of Materials).\nDetermine the plate setup. This assay will be performed in triplicate, limiting the number of drugs and concentrations that can be tested on one plate.\n\tNOTE: Selected PDO lines must be carefully observed before performing the assay. Established ovarian cancer PDOs form multicellular solid and hollow spheres with tumor-like budding shapes (Figure 1B). PDO morphology, genomic profile, etc., must be compared to that of the patient sample (when possible) before performing the assay29-33. Ovarian cancer PDOs can be generated from primary and metastatic tumor samples and ascites17.\n2. Reagent preparation for the viability assay",
    "Base Media: To advanced DMEM/F12, add 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin, 1x glutamax, and 1% (v/v)HEPES17 (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare Advance Organoid Media for ovarian cancer organoids following previously published report17.\n3. Plating of organoids (~Day -2)\nNOTE: This step must be performed 1-3 days before adding the drugs. Before beginning, warm all reagents (Base Media, Advance Organoid Media, and organoid dissociation reagent; see Table of Materials) to 37 °C in a water bath. Thaw BME in an ice water bath.\nUse a brightfield microscope to confirm whether organoids of interest are 70%-90% confluent.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to save images of the organoids for future reference.\nAdd 1-2 mL of warmed Base Media to the well containing organoids and pipette up and down to mechanically dissociate the BME-containing organoids. Transfer the entire solution to a 15 mL conical tube17.\n\tNOTE: Typically, 1-2 mL of media is enough to properly dilute the BME. Organoids of the same patient and passage can be combined.\nVortex for 5-10 s to further dissociate the cells, and centrifuge at 1107 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT).\nRemove the supernatant with a single-channel pipette and discard. Resuspend organoids in 1 mL organoid dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) and transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Incubate for 7 min at 37 °C.\n\t\nIf the pellet is still gelatinous because of the remaining BME, add an additional 1 mL of Base Media, vortex for 5-10 s, and repeat centrifugation.\nCentrifuge at 1107 x g for 5 min at RT. Remove and discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of Base Media.\nCount the number of cells in each PDO culture using an automatic cell counter (see Table of Materials) or a hemocytometer.",
    "Resuspend cells at 20,000 cells per 10 µL of 25% Base Media and 75% BME. Do this by resuspending the organoids in the media and mixing with BME.\nPlate one 3 µL droplets of resuspended BME + PDO cells into one well of a black opaque 96-well plate (see Table of Materials). Place the droplets in the center of each well. Plate each drug concentration in triplicate.\n\tNOTE: Since the cell viability assay is luminescence-based, it is best to use black opaque plates to avoid background. Transparent plates can be used to visualize organoids during the assay, but the bottom of the plates should be covered with opaque tape before measuring luminescence.\nIncubate plate in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C for 15 min.\nAdd 100 µL of Advance Organoid Media to each well. Incubate plate for 24-72 h (determine according to perceived PDO doubling time). Add 100 µL of Advance Organoid Media to an empty well for use as blank.\n\tNOTE: The goal is to allow organoids to form.\nOptional: For growth rate analysis, plate additional triplicate PDOs in a separate plate. This will be used to count cells at Time = 0 and should be assayed on Day 0 using the viability assay described in Section 5.\n4. Addition of drugs for the viability assay on Day 0\nNOTE: Day 0 refers to the day the drugs are added to the fully formed organoids.\nDilute selected drugs in Advance Organoid Media to desired concentrations. Dilutions can be made in 1.5 mL tubes or in a pre-set up 96-well plate, which would allow for the use of a multi-channel pipette to dispense the media.",
    "NOTE: Drugs must be resuspended in the solvent suggested by the manufacturer, such as dimethyl sulfoxide. For this study, the following dilutions of carboplatin in Advance Organoid Media, were made: 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 75 µM.\nRemove media from each well with a single or multi-channel pipette, being careful not to touch or disturb the PDO/BME droplet.\nAdd 100 µL of Advance Organoid Media and desired drug(s) to each well. Ensure to add fresh media to the three control wells.\n\tNOTE: Drug concentrations will vary and depend on the scientific question and drug mechanism of action. When deciding what concentrations to use, we begin with previously established drug concentrations in comparable 2D cell lines (e.g., immortalized ovarian cancer cell lines). Concentrations may need to be increased if there is no observed effect on organoids.\nRefresh media and drugs as needed (repeat steps 4.1-4.3). Whether the media will need to be refreshed depends on the assay length, the drug's biological activity, and the drug's half-life. For assays over one week, the media will need to be refreshed at least once.\n5. Ending the viability assay for readout (~Day 7)\nNOTE: This step can be performed on Days 7-10. The assay length must be determined according to the half-life and pharmacodynamics of the drugs being tested.\nAllow the viability assay reagents to reach room temperature in dark. Store the reagents at 4 °C overnight (in the dark) to reduce the thaw time.\nRemove the assay plate from cell culture incubator and allow it to acclimate to room temperature for 30 min. The plate does not have to acclimate in the dark.",
    "Add 100 µL of viability assay reagent (see Table of Materials) to each well (for a total volume of 200 µL), and place on a plate-shaker for 5 min (80 rpm). Remove the plate from the shaker and incubate for an additional 25 min at room temperature. Ensure the plate is always protected from light by covering it with foil or an opaque box.\nTurn on the bioluminescence plate reader and open the i-control software (see Table of Materials).\nUnder Connect to: Instrument Name, select infinite 200Pro.\nSelect Luminescence and Default Script.\nFrom the drop-down menu, choose plate type [BD96fb_Falcon-BD] Falcon 96 Flat Black.\nDetermine which wells to read and highlight the corresponding wells under Part of Plate.\nUnder Measurements on the left side of the screen, drag and drop Luminescence under the Part of Plate.\nSelect the luminescence parameters: Attenuation: NONE; Integration time: 1000 ms; Settle time: 0 ms.\nRemove the cover from the plate and load it into the plate reader. Press Start to begin.\nOn completion, export data and save.\n6. Data analysis\nCalculate the percent cell viability.\n\t\nSubtract the \"Blank\" from every well for the Blank Corrected readings. Next, calculate Control Average by averaging the three control wells.\nUse the following equation to calculate the percentage of viable cells in each well: (Experimental well / Control Average) x 100\nGraph the resulting data in the analysis software (see Table of Materials).\nExamine Growth Rate (GR) metrics.\n\t\nManually calculate the GR metrics according to the published report34.\nAlternatively, use the online GR calculator (see Table of Materials) to generate the metrics35. Use the Day 0 measurements as \"cell_count_time0\", which reflect the growth rate of the untreated PDOs.\nExport data and graph.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
