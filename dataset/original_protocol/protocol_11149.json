  "procedures": [
    "All procedures included here have been reviewed and approved by the ethical committee regulating experimental medicine in the University of Copenhagen and agree with Danish and European legislation. To demonstrate this protocol, we have used female BALB/cJ mice of 8-12 weeks of age and an MMTV-PyMT female mouse of 11 weeks of age.\nNOTE: Avoiding bacterial contamination of the decellularized ECM scaffold gives the best imaging outcome and allows long-term sample storage. It is therefore important to keep all the steps sterile. As such, all instruments and surgical material, including suture, micro-suture, solutions, tubing, Luer connectors and catheters, must be sterile. Surfaces, including a polystyrene tray, must be disinfected with 70% ethanol, and the perfusion should preferably be carried out under a laminar flow hood. All procedures take place at room temperature unless otherwise indicated.\n1. Post-mortem microsurgery\nEuthanize the mouse using a CO2 chamber.\n\t\nPlace mouse into a 4 L chamber, and begin to fill with 100% CO2, starting at 0.2 L/min for 2 min, increasing until reaching a flow of 0.8 L/min after 3 min. The mouse should fall unconscious during the first 2 min, and then respiration should cease (usually around 5 min, but flow can be maintained as necessary). Confirm death prior to proceeding to the next step.\nShave the thorax, abdomen and back of the mouse with the hair clipper and disinfect with 70% ethanol. Shaving greatly reduces the number of artifacts due to the presence of hair either on samples for imaging or biochemical analysis.\nPin the mouse to a polystyrene tray, extending its fore- and hindlimbs, as well as its head and tail. Place it under the microsurgery microscope.",
    "Using a Mayo straight pattern scissors establish surgical access with a cutaneous incision running from the submandibular region to the lower abdomen and dissect subcutaneously to expose the thoracic wall and peritoneum.\nUsing microsurgical scissors, cut the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles along the sixth intercostal space on both sides of the thoracic wall.\nUsing straight-pattern scissors, cut the sternum along the previous incisions, and then complete a sternotomy by cutting the sternum along its long axis, then elevate and pin both sides of the thoracic wall to expose the cardiopulmonary complex.\nUsing round-tipped micro-forceps (or Dumont micro-forceps), excise the thymus and surrounding adipose tissue by delicately pulling them off their attachments. This will reveal the major vessels.\nUsing the cautery, cauterize the descending cava vein and, using straight pattern scissors, cut the esophagus.\nUsing sharp micro-forceps, separate the brachiocephalic veins and the brachiocephalic, left common carotid and left subclavian arteries from the underlying tissue to facilitate ligation and cauterization.\nUsing micro-needle holder, sharp micro-forceps and 9-0 suture place stitches above the emergence of the brachiocephalic, left common carotid and left subclavian arteries.\nCauterize the brachiocephalic veins.\nSeparate the submandibular salivary glands along the midline to expose the neck muscles and the trachea. Separate the muscles to expose the cricothyroid ligament. Using micro-scissors, open an entrance by sectioning the ligament.\nIntroduce a 27 G catheter in the trachea and delicately push until the trachea branches into the bronchi (i.e., until resistance to the catheter is met, then retreat 3 mm). Be careful not to disrupt the bronchi. Using a 6-0 suture, place 3 stitches around the trachea to secure the catheter.",
    "Section the mouse at the height of the 12th thoracic vertebra. The descending aorta runs anteriorly to the spine and should be sectioned here along with the spine. Set the lower half apart.\nRetrogradely catheterize the aorta and push the catheter until it reaches the aortic arc. Using 9-0 suture, place 4 stitches around the aorta, beginning 5 mm below the catheter tip.\n2. Decellularization\nConnect the mouse to a pump system using silicone tubing and Luer connectors. Perfuse with deionized water at 200 µL/min for 15 min. Maintain this flow rate during decellularization.\nChange the perfusion agent to 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) diluted in deionized water and perfuse overnight.\nChange the perfusion agent to 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) diluted in deionized water and perfuse for 8 hours.\nPerfuse with deionized water overnight to wash away SDS and DOC for 24 h.\nResect the decellularized heart and lungs by sectioning its attachments to the thorax using a curved scissors and store in a sterile cryo-tube with deionized water with 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin and 0.3 µM sodium azide at 4 °C. ECM scaffolds can be stored for at least for 12 weeks1. If the scaffold will be used for biochemical analysis (e.g., mass spectrometry), snap freeze in liquid nitrogen.\n3. Immunostaining\nPlan the imaging: determine primary antibody (or antibodies) and the combination of fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies to match each other and to fit the laser lines of the fluorescence microscope.\nBlock the sample by immersing it in a cryotube containing 6% (v/v) donkey serum - 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight.\nIncubate with primary antibody (or antibodies) in 3% donkey serum in PBS for 24 h.\nWash 5 times for 1 h each time in 0.05% tween 20 in PBS (PBST).",
    "Incubate the sample with fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody (or antibodies) in 3% donkey serum in PBS for 24 h.\nWash 5 times for 1 hour in 0.05% (PBST). Wait 1 h between each wash.\nAdd deionized water and store at 4 °C away from direct light. At this point, the scaffold is ready to image.\n4. Imaging\nPlace the sample in a glass-bottomed dish and humidify it with two droplets of storing solution (PBS or deionized water).\nPrepare the objective. We recommend using a water immersion objective.\nInspect the sample using fluorescence light.\nSwitch to computer control. Turn on lasers and adjust laser intensity, pinhole aperture, detectors wavelengths, gain, resolution and zoom. Set the number and step size for z-stack and begin acquisition. We recommend using multiphoton laser excitation to increase tissue penetration and to minimize scattering of light, bleaching and tissue damage.\n5. Hematoxylin-eosin staining\nExcise 1 lung lobe from a euthanized mouse.\nPlace in a 10 mm x 10 mm x 5 mm cryomold and cover it with approximately 500 µL of OCT compound.\nFreeze on dry ice (-70 °C) and maintain the sample at that temperature.\nExcise one decellularized lung lobe from a processed mouse according to step 2.5.\nPlace in a cryomold with the largest surface area down and cover it with OCT compound as specified in step 5.2.\nFreeze on dry ice (-70°C) and maintain the sample at that temperature until otherwise required. The sample can be stored for at least 12 weeks.\nSection frozen tissue blocks at -20 °C in a cryostat with 5 µm thickness and place sections on adhesive glass slides and store at -80 °C.\nTake slides to room temperature until air dried (approximately 20 min).",
    "Shortly immerse in PBS and fix by immersing the slides in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Wash once in PBS for 5 min, then twice in distilled water for 5 min.\nImmerse in Mayer's hematoxylin solution for 10 min. This time can be optimized according to tissue source and stain preparation.\nWash in a Coplin jar under running distilled water for 10 min.\nImmerse in eosin solution for 7 min. This time can be optimized according to tissue source and stain preparation.\nDip in 50% ethanol to remove excess Eosin and dehydrate by shortly dipping in 70% ethanol, and in 96% and 100% ethanol for 30 seconds. Dip in xylene several times.\nApply few drops of DPX mounting medium and place a glass coverslip.\nLeave slides to dry overnight under a chemical hood.\nScan slides in a slide scanner.\nSubscription Required.
