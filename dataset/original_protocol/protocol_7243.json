    "AnimalsBreed the C57BL/6 strain (2–4 mice per cage) under the following specific pathogen-free conditions: at 23 ± 1°C controlled temperature, 12 h light-dark cycles (light on at 8:00 and off at 20:00), and ad libitum access to food and water.Preparation of eCG (7.5 IU/100 µL)Open three vials containing eCG powder and two bottles of saline.Add 2 mL of saline into each eCG vial using a P-1000 pipette with a 1,000 µL tip, mix by pipetting, and transfer the solution (a total volume of 6 mL) to a 50 mL tube.Repeat Step B2 twice to collect all the eCG, i.e., dissolve eCG powder (3,000 IU) in 18 mL of saline.Add 22 mL of saline into the 50 mL tube using a pipette controller with a 10 mL plastic pipette to obtain an eCG working solution, i.e., dissolve eCG powder (3,000 IU) in 40 mL of saline.Prepare 1.2 mL aliquots (7.5 IU/100 µL per mouse) in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20°C until use, for up to six months.When needed, thaw the eCG solution completely at room temperature and mix well before use.Preparation of hCG (7.5 IU/100 µL)Open a vial containing hCG powder and two bottles of saline.Add 2 mL of saline into the hCG vial using the P-1000 pipette with a new 1,000 µL tip, mix by pipetting, and transfer the solution to a new 50 mL tube.Repeat Step C2 twice to collect all the hCG, i.e., dissolve hCG powder (3,000 IU) in 6 mL of saline.Add 34 mL of saline into the 50 mL tube using the pipette controller with a new 10 mL plastic pipette to obtain the hCG working solution, i.e., dissolve hCG powder (3,000 IU) in 40 mL of saline.Prepare 1.2 mL aliquots (7.5 IU/100 μL per mouse) in 1.",
    "5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20°C until use, for up to six months.When needed, thaw the hCG solution completely at room temperature and mix well before use.Preparation of M2 medium containing hyaluronidaseMeasure 0.5 mg of hyaluronidase and add to a new 50 mL tube.Thaw M2 medium and add 50 mL to the tube containing hyaluronidase (1% solution).Mix thoroughly by gentle inversion.Prepare 1 mL aliquots in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and store at -20°C until use.When needed, thaw the solution completely at room temperature and mix well before use.Note: Hyaluronidase is sterile but non-filtered because this reagent is adjusted on a clean bench.Preparation of glass pipettes for egg handling (see Video 1)Cut the glass pipettes in the middle using an ampoule glass cutter (Figure 1A).Heat the cut edge of glass pipettes with the flame of an alcohol lamp to smooth.Hold both sides of the glass pipette with one hand and a pair of curved tip tweezers.Heat the middle of the pipette until it is softened slightly (Figure 1B), remove from the flame, and immediately pull both ends horizontally.Cut the excess part of the pipette, heat, and smooth the tip slightly. The smooth tip is less likely to damage the eggs and dishes.Check the tip under a stereomicroscope (Figure 1C) and choose glass pipettes with an inner diameter of approximately 150–200 µm.Wrap the glass pipettes with aluminum foil (Figure 1D), dry-heat sterilize (180°C, 30 min), and store in a new 15 mL tube at room temperature.Note: Pipettes with proper inner diameter enable to handle eggs easily. Multiple glass pipettes should be prepared for one experiment to replace the pipette with a new one when operation is not easy (e.g., cumulus cells adhere to the tip). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.

(D) Wrap glass pipettes.SuperovulationThaw eCG or CARD HyperOva® solutions at room temperature and mix well.Aspirate the required amount of eCG or HyperOva® (100 μL per mouse) with a syringe; for example, aspirate 1 mL of eCG or HyperOva® for 10 female mice (Figure 2A).Hold a mouse and inject 100 µL of eCG or HyperOva® into the peritoneal cavity (Figure 2B and 2C).Return mice to their cages.At 48 h after injecting eCG or HyperOva®, inject 100 µL of hCG in the same manner (Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C).Return mice to their cages.Note: Either wrong dosage or inadequate timing of hormone injection reduces the number of normal eggs ovulated. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4439/bioprotoc-12-11-4439-g002.jpgFigure 2.

AIS, anti-inhibin serum; eCG, equine chorionic gonadotropin; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin.Preparation of dishesAdd paraffin liquid to an empty 35 mm dish (Figure 3A and 3B).Place four and six CARD mHTF medium drops (100 µL per drop) in two 60 mm dishes and cover these drops with paraffin liquid (Figure 3A, 3C, 3D, and 3E).Incubate these dishes in a CO2 incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for at least 30 min before collecting the egg-cumulus complex (Figure 3F).Thaw the M2 medium containing hyaluronidase and place four drops (200 µL per drop) in a new 60 mm dish (Figure 3G and 3H). Note: Prepare this just before washing the eggs. There is no need to cover M2 medium drops with paraffin liquid and to place them in the CO2 incubator.",
    "As M2 medium is a 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-based medium, it can be used for a long time at room temperature outside the CO2 incubator (Carter et al., 1993).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4439/bioprotoc-12-11-4439-g003.jpgFigure 3.

(F) CO2 incubator. (G, H) Dish for removing cumulus cells from the egg.Collection of the egg-cumulus complexPlace scissors and tweezers on the bench (Figure 4A) and wear gloves (and other protective equipment as necessary).At 14–16 h after injecting hCG, sacrifice female mice (Figure 2C).Disinfect the abdomen with 70% ethanol and cut the abdominal skin of mice using large scissors.Pull two sides of the cut skin and access the mouse peritoneum.Cut the peritoneum using small scissors.Locate the V-shaped uterus, oviducts, and ovaries by shifting the position of the gut and internal organs.Hold the utero-tubal junction with a pair of precision tweezers, cut the utero-tubal and isthmic-ampullary junctions, and separate the oviducts from the uterus (Figure 5A and 5B).Clean the oviducts by removing adipose tissue, blood, and tissue fluid, and transfer oviducts to the keeping dish moved from the CO2 incubator.Note: Reduce the exposure time of the collecting dish to room temperature using the keeping dish. Move the collecting dish from the CO2 incubator to the bench and transfer oviducts to liquid paraffin on the collecting dish using the pair of precision tweezers and place the oviducts on the bottom of this dish.Take out the egg-cumulus complex from the ampulla using a needle under the stereomicroscope (Video 2 and Figure 4B) and add the egg-cumulus complex to one drop of CARD mHTF medium on the collecting dish (Figure 6A and 6B). Superovulation treatment induces an average of 20–50 eggs per female mouse (Shindo et al.",
    ", 2021), and one drop includes <100 eggs.Move the collecting dish to the CO2 incubator.Repeat Steps H2–H11 for all female mice.Note: Prepare the CARD mHTF medium drops corresponding to the number of superovulated mice. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4439/bioprotoc-12-11-4439-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Arrow indicates the ampulla.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Removing the egg-cumulus complex from the ampulla. Removing cumulus cells and counting eggsMove the collecting and washing dishes from the CO2 incubator to the bench.Aspirate the M2 medium containing hyaluronidase using a mouth pipetting set (Figure 4C), and transfer the egg-cumulus complex from the CARD mHTF medium drop on the collecting dish to the drop of M2 medium with hyaluronidase on the removing dish. Note: Aspirate the M2 medium containing hyaluronidase until the wide part of the glass pipette for easy handling of the eggs (Figure 4D).  Remove cumulus cells from the egg-cumulus complex by mouth pipetting and transfer the eggs to the drops of CARD mHTF medium on the washing dish (Figure 6C).Wash the eggs by moving them between three drops of CARD mHTF medium on the washing dish.Repeat steps I2–I4 for all egg-cumulus complexes.Count the number of normal eggs per drop using a mechanical tally counter and record the results in Microsoft Excel. Normal and abnormal eggs are easily distinguished by morphology (Figure 6D and 6E).",
    "Note: If the number of normal eggs is reduced, check the expiration date for solutions used, the timing of superovulation, and whether the age of mice is suitable for superovulation. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4439/bioprotoc-12-11-4439-g006.jpgFigure 6.
