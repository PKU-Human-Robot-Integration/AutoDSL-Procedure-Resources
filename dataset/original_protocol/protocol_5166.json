    "Original protocol for pericyte isolation from meninges using AnxA5-LacZ micePrepare approximately 200 ml of 5% FCS-PBS and cool down 100 ml of 5% FCS-PBS on ice.Carefully isolate the brain from 4-6 months old AnxA5-LacZ mice. Dissect the meninges under a stereomicroscope and transfer them into a 15 ml tube with 5% FCS-PBS on ice. Collect several meninges and then centrifuge the sample for five min at 400 x g at 4 °C.Aspirate supernatant and dissolve pellet in 1.5-3.0 ml of 0.4% collagenase type II. Incubate sample for 60 min at 37 °C slightly shaking. Subsequently, centrifuge digested tissue for five min at 400 x g at room temperature.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend in 1.5-3.0 ml of 2% trypsin/100 U DNAse I. Then, incubate digested tissue for 30 min at 37 °C slightly shaking. Next, centrifuge for five minutes at 400 x g at room temperature. Resuspend cell pellet in 5% FCS-PBS and filter cell suspension through a 100 μm cell strainer. After that, centrifuge cell suspension for 5 min at 400 x g at room temperature.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 5% FCS-PBS. Determine cell number by using a hemocytometer, then dissolve 1 x 106 cells in 20 µl of 5% FCS-PBS and distribute 20 µl of the cell suspension into new 1.5 ml tubes. Add 20 µl of 2 mM fluorescein-di-(β-D-galactopyranoside) (FDG) to 20 µl cell suspension and incubate mix at 37 °C for 75 sec. Add 500 µl of ice-cold 5% FCS-PBS to the cells and incubate on ice in the dark for 3 h. Use a non-stained sample as control for cell sorting.Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 min at 400 x g at RT and resuspend cell pellet in 500 µl of 5% FCS-PBS.",
    "To exclude dead cells, add propidium iodide (final concentration 1 µg/ml)Sort stained cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (MoFlow, Cytomation) and collect propidium iodide negative and FDG positive cells. Next, plate 5 x 104 of PI negative/FDG positive cells per well in proliferation medium (see Recipes) on gelatin-coated 24-well-plate and store cells in a 5% CO2 humidity incubator at 37 °C. Change medium every second day and expanse isolated cells. After initial expansion, the cells are cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS and 1% P/S. Cells should be further characterized by flow cytometry. Cells are positive for Sca-1, CD140b and α-SMA and negative for PECAM, CD45, CD34, F4/F80 and c-kit. Isolated Anxa5-LacZ(+) PVC from mouse meninges retain their perivascular cell phenotype and can be cultured without undergoing senescence for multiple passages (Brachvogel et al., 2007). Note: An established and well characterized PVC cell line with superior angiogenic activity can be send to individual researcher upon request to perform coculture experiments with endothelial cells (Zhou et al., 2016). This eliminates the need to isolate the cells from mouse brain meninges. Co-culture of PVCs and HUVECs in collagen type I gelsDissolve 0.1 g of gelatin in 100 g of autoclaved distilled water (final concentration 0.1%) and autoclave the solution at 121 °C for 30 min. Then, coat 100 mm TC-treated cell culture dish with gelatin by adding 5 ml of 0.1% gelatin solution to the dish and distribute gelatin solution until the whole 100 mm TC-treated cell culture dish surface is fully covered. After at less two hours’ incubation at 37 °C, the residual gelatin solution is aspirated. Subsequently, dry dish at room temperature before use. HUVECs are cultured in EGM2 culture medium (see Recipes) on gelatin-coated plates in a 5% CO2 humidity incubator at 37 °C.",
    "Cells are cultured until subconfluent (~80%) and further passaged (1:3 dilution). HUVEC are only used in early passages (passage 3-6). PVCs are cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS and 1% P/S (see Recipes) on T75-flasks or on 10 cm dishes and expand to about 80% confluency (see Note 2 and Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414195624_1611.jpgFigure 1. Cultured perivascular cells (PVC) and human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with different cell densities. Representative phase contrast images of 80% and 100% confluency (cell density) cultured PVCs and HUVECs. The cell density plays an important role for this co-culture experiment and can affect the tube formation. Bars = 100 µm.Prepare 10 ml of 2x medium-mix (see Recipes). Therefore, dissolve 0.38 g of NaHCO3 in 10 ml of autoclaved distilled water (concentration 0.45 M) and after dissolving sterile filter the solution. Then, mix 2 ml of 10x DMEM, 200 µl of 100x sodium pyruvate and 1 ml of prepared 0.45 M NaHCO3 (final concentration 0.045 M) in 6.8 ml (final volume 10 ml) of autoclaved distilled H2O. Solution should be cool on ice until use. For 4 ml of collagen solution (see Recipes), mix 2 ml of 2x medium-mix, 800 µl FCS (final concentration 20%), 963 µl of 8.3 mg/ml rat tail type I collagen (see Note 3) (final concentration 2 mg/ml) and 23 µl of autoclaved distilled H2O on ice. Finally, neutralize collagen type I gel solution with 214 µl of 0.1 N NaOH on ice and adjust pH of solution to 7.4. Store the prepared collagen solution on ice until usage. Wash sub-confluent, cultured HUVECs and PVCs with 10 ml of PBS and detach cells with 1-2 ml trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. Add 9 ml of EGM2 culture medium to stop reaction and collect cells in a 15 ml tube.",
    "Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 400 x g at room temperature (RT). Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cell pellets in 5 ml of EGM2 culture medium. Add 10 µl of each cell suspension into a hemocytometer to determine cell concentration.For monoculture, transfer 6.25 x 105 HUVECs or 1.25 x 105 PVCs (see Note 4) in EGM2 medium in a new 15 ml tube. Mix 6.25 x 105 HUVECs and 1.25 x 105 PVCs for co-culture in 2 ml EGM2 medium in a new 15 ml tube (Figure 2). Alternatively, different endothelial cells or perivascular cells can be used, but the relative ratio of cells need to adapted and tested. Technical duplicates or triplicates are highly recommended. Centrifuge cell suspensions at 400 x g for 5 min at RT. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414195854_3262.jpgFigure 2.  Workflow of the three-dimensional co-culture assayCarefully remove all medium and resuspend cell pellets in 1 ml of collagen type I gel solution. Add 200 µl into each well of a 48-well plate and incubate for 60 min at 37 °C until solutions turn into gel. To increase homogeneity of gels, collagen type I gel solution with cells should be properly mixed and gel solution be uniformly disturbed in the well. Try to prevent uneven distribution of the solution by adding the gel solution directly in the center of the well and distribute by moving the 48-well plate carefully. To improve gelling, 48-well plates should be prewarmed in the incubator at 37 °C Check after 60 min whether a homogenous gel has formed. Otherwise incubate additional 30 min. After gelling, carefully add 400 µl EGM2 culture medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml VEGF, 10 ng/ml PDGF and 250 μg/ml ascorbic acid phosphate on top of each gel. Other growth factors or drugs may be added at this stage for different experimental conditions.",
    "Incubate the gels for 3-6 days (see Note 6) in a 5% CO2 humidity incubator and take images (Figure 3) or videos (3 images/h) every 24 h. We used 10 or 20x objectives to take images of networks (Zeiss SteREO Lumar.V12 or Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL). Higher magnification can be used but the thickness of the gel can hinder the acquisition of images. EGM2 culture medium with supplements should be replaced every 48 h. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414200011_3323.jpgFigure 3. Tube formation studies of mono and co-culture HUVECs in a three-dimensional collagen type I gel. After 96 h, HUVECs form in present of perivascular cells a robust tube network in a collagen type I gel, whereas monocultured HUVECs few tubes. Representative phase contrast images were taken with 20x objective. Bars = 100 µm.Immunohistochemical detection of extracellular matrix and cellular proteins in 3D culturesWash gels twice with 600 µl of PBS (see Note 6).Fix gels with 400 µl of 80% methanol/20% DMSO (Dent’s Fixative) for 30 min at RT.Rehydrate gels with 600 µl of 50% methanol/PBS for 1 h at RT. Remove solution and add 600 µl of 20% methanol/PBS. Next, wash gel in 600 µl of PBS-T (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at RT.Aspirate solution and add 600 µl of 10% FCS, 5% BSA in PBS for 2-4 h at RT to block non-specific antibody-binding.Carefully remove blocking solution and incubate gels with 150-300 µl of primary antibody diluted in blocking solution (10% FCS, 5% BSA in PBS), overnight at 4 °C lightly shaking on a rocking plate. Antibody dilutions should be tested empirically before.Wash gels with 600 µl of TBS-T (0.1% Tween in TBS) for an hour. Repeat washing steps six times.Incubate samples with 150-300 µl of fluorescent chromophore-conjugated, secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 2-16 h in the dark at RT.",
    "Wash gels with 600 µl of TBS-T (0.1% Tween in TBS) for an hour. Then, repeat washing step six times.Carefully remove gels from the wall of the well using a 27 G needle. Use a 5 ml macro pipet tips to transfer gels on slides. Add 50 µl of mounting solution on top of the gels and carefully mount samples with a glass coverslip. Images are taken with Zeiss Axioplan 2 by using 5x and 63x objectives and adequate filter sets to get overview and close-up images, respectively. To visualize HUVECs in three-dimensional cultures gels can be immunostained with CD31 (Figures 4A and 4B) and PVCs can be immunostained with NG2-PG (Figure 4B) or α-SMA specific antibodies. The overview images of CD31+ HUVECs are used for tube formation analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414200201_0100.jpgFigure 4. Endothelial tube formation of human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was induced upon co-coculturing with PVC. A. HUVECs are cultured either alone (monoculture) or in co-culture with PVC in a three-dimensional collagen I gel. After 6 days in culture, the three-dimensional collagen I gels were stained with human CD31 as described in Procedure C. Scale bars = 500 µM. B. Immunostainings of co-cultured HUVECs and PVCs using CD31 and NG2-proteoglycan (NG2-PG) specific antibodies. Individual or as merged images with nuclear staining (DAPI) are shown. Scale bars = 100 µm.Cell labelling with fluorescent dyes (CFSE, SNARF-1) for live cell trackingDissolve CFSE or SNARF-1 in DMSO to a final concentration of 5 mM at RT in the dark. After using fluorescent dyes, solution can be aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. For subsequent use of fluorescent dyes, thaw CFSE and SNARF-1 dye at RT in the dark. Freshly prepare 100 ml of 3% FCS-PBS solution.",
    "Store 25 ml at RT and cool the remaining 75 ml on ice for at least 30 min.Detach HUVECs and PVCs as described (see step A3) and collect cells in 15 ml tubes. Determine cell number using a hemocytometer, then centrifuge cells for 5 min at 400 x g at RT.Resuspend cell pellets in an appropriate amount of 3% FCS-PBS to a final concentration of 1 x 107 cells per 1 ml of 3% FCS-PBS. Do not use less than 50 µl of 3% FCS-PBS solution.Prior to use, prepare 0.5 mM solutions of CFSE and SNARF-1 using PBS. Then, further dilute CFSE or SNARF-1 solutions (0.5 mM) using cell suspensions to a final concentration of 0.01 mM. Typically, 2 µl of 0.5 mM CFSE are added to 100 µl cell suspension. All following steps are performed in the dark avoiding light exposure.Mix HUVECs and PVCs for 10 sec at maximum speed on a vortex mixer. Then, incubate cell suspensions for 10 min in a water bath, pre-heated to 37 °C, without shaking.Add 5 ml of ice cold 3% FCS-PBS to stop the reaction and centrifuge cells for 5 min at 400 x g at 4 °C. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellets in 5 ml of ice cold 3% FCS-PBS. Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 400 x g at 4 °C. After centrifugation, aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet again in 5 ml of ice cold 3% FCS-PBS. Centrifuge cell suspensions for additional 5 min at 400 x g at 4 °C.Resuspend cells in an appropriate amount of EGM2 culture and proceed with step A4. Reduce light exposure during the subsequent steps and images (Figure 5) should be taken on an inverted microscope Eclipse TE2000-U (Nikon) or SteREO Lumar.V12 (Zeiss) over time. Here, a 20x objective was used for visualization.",
    "For each image, a phase contrast and fluorescence images in adequate channels (e.g., FITC-channel for CFSE labelled cells) were taken. SNARF-1 is normally used for detecting initial tube formation (a few hours after gelling). Later SNARF-1 labelling is difficult to detect. This system can be used to track the recruitment of perivascular cells to the endothelial cells during initial angiogenesis steps.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170414/20170414200452_7938.jpgFigure 5. Co-culture of human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and CFSE labelled perivascular cells (PVC) to track perivascular cells in three-dimensional condition. PVCs were labelled with CFSE as described in Procedure D and subsequently co-cocultured with HUVECs in a three-dimensional collagen type I gel. After 72 h in culture, phase contrast image and fluorescence images were taken with a 20x objective. The brightness and contrast of the CFSE fluorescent and merged image were adjusted for visualization. Scale bars = 100 µm."
