  "procedures": [
    "1. Maintenance of Drosophila Tissue Culture Cells\nMaintain S2R+, S2R+:RLC-EGFP, and S2:Fog-Myc cells at room temperature, preferably between 20 °C and 25 °C, in Shield and Sang M3 insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 amphotericin B at a density no lower than 5 x 105 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: Lower cell densities lead to death.\nQuickly thaw cryo-preserved vials of cells and transfer them to a tissue culture flask. Start with a small tissue culture flask (12.5 cm2 or 25 cm2) in a volume of 4 - 5 mL of cell culture medium until the culture is established and signs of cell death due to thawing have subsided.\n\tNOTE: Signs of cell death due to thawing include non-adherent cells that lack a smooth, rounded shape and small dark bits of cellular debris in the tissue culture medium indicative of necrotic cells.\nSlowly scale up the size of the tissue culture by allowing the cells to grow undisturbed for several days (4 - 8 d) to 100% confluency, where there is little to no space between the cells and they begin to pile up on one another. Transfer all the cells from this 100% confluent smaller 12.5-cm2 or 25-cm2 flask to a larger tissue culture flask (of 75 cm2) supplemented with 10 mL of cell culture medium.\n\tNOTE: Maintaining the cells in a 75-cm2 flask will yield enough cells for most experiments.\nPassage the cells every 3 - 4 d by pipetting the cell culture medium up and down, using it to dislodge any loosely adhered cells from the tissue culture plastic. Transfer this medium, now containing the resuspended cells, into a fresh flask. Dilute the cells 1:4 with fresh cell culture medium with each passage and repeat as needed.",
    "2. RNAi Treatment of Drosophila S2R+ Cells\nNOTE: Refer to Rogers and Rogers6 for detailed instructions on how to produce dsRNA suitable for insect culture.\nTransfer S2R+ cells to a 6-well or 12-well tissue culture plate at a density conducive for the viability, no lower than 5 x 105 cells/mL, using complete Shield and Sang M3 cell culture media for RNAi treatments.\nWorking in a tissue culture hood, remove the old cell culture medium by gently tilting the 6-well or 12-well tissue culture plate and aspirating the cell culture medium with a pipette. Quickly replace this old cell culture medium with the 1 mL of fresh cell culture medium by pipetting it into each well.\n\tNOTE: This can be done without substantial loss after the cells have been allowed to loosely adhere for 30 - 45 min prior to exchanging the cell culture medium.\nAdd 10 µg/mL of dsRNA that has been generated following the detailed protocol in Rogers and Rogers6 by pipetting it directly into the tissue culture medium of each well of cells per RNAi condition.\nRepeat this procedure daily, replacing the cell culture medium with 1 mL of fresh medium and 10 µg/mL of dsRNA per RNAi condition.\n\tNOTE: RNAi experiments are typically carried out for 7 d; however, the exact timing is dependent on protein turnover and efficacy of the dsRNA. RNAi treatments as short as 3 d effectively deplete cells of certain proteins, while other targets require longer treatments6.\n3. Fog Production and Harvest",
    "Scale up the growth of the S2:Fog-Myc cells by allowing them to grow undisturbed for 4 - 8 d to obtain a nearly 100% confluent 75-cm2 flask of cells in 10 mL of cell culture medium (or alternatively, a 150-cm2 flask in 20 mL of cell culture medium) to maximize Fog production.\nAdd 50 µL of 100 mM CuSO4 (or 100 µL of 100 mM CuSO4 for a 150-cm2 flask) to the nearly 100% confluent 75-cm2 flask for the induction of the metallothionine promoter. Incubate for 48 h at room temperature.\nRemove the Fog-Myc-containing medium from the tissue culture flask by pipetting and transfer it to a 15-mL or 50-mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 2,500 x g at 4 °C for 10 - 15 min to clear the medium of cells and cellular debris.\nTransfer the cleared cell medium to a new conical tube and maintain it on ice. Working in batches, transfer 5 mL of the cleared medium to 15 mL of 3,000 MW concentrators with regenerated cellulose membranes and centrifuge it at 2,500 x g at 4 °C for 30 min at a time, to concentrate the medium.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, a concentrator with a larger volume capacity could be used (50 mL). During concentration, a darker colored medium, which is enriched with Fog, will begin to build up at the bottom of the V-shaped filter.\nInsert the pipette tip to the bottom of the \"V\" of the concentrator and remove the darker colored media between each round of centrifugation and transfer it to a fresh 1.7-mL microfuge tube. Maintain the media on ice.",
    "Using the same concentrator, repeat steps 3.4 and 3.5 by removing the darker colored concentrated Fog-Myc media and replacing it with more precleared medium, until the medium has been concentrated to 1/10th of its original volume (i.e., 1 mL from 10 mL of starting material).\nStore the concentrated Fog-Myc at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: After storage, be sure to monitor for bacterial contamination, which may result from extended periods of storage.\nPerform SDS-PAGE by mixing 10 µL of concentrated Fog-Myc medium with 10 µL of a denaturing SDS-containing buffer to form a lysate. Run the SDS-PAGE gel at 35 mA for approximately 1 h. Transfer the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane (or alternatively, a PVDF membrane) for 1 h at 120 mA. Perform a western blot using any commercially available Myc antibody to detect a 150-kDa band.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of Fog-Myc in the conditioned medium may vary per batch. It is not necessary to determine the exact concentration of Fog-Myc in order to perform the assay, but the efficacy of each batch should be tested prior to performing an experiment.\nFollowing steps 3.1 - 3.2, prepare the control S2-conditioned media by collecting 10 mL of cell culture medium from a nearly 100% confluent 75-cm2 flask of S2 cells (or, alternatively, 20 mL from a 150-cm2 flask) by pipetting. Transfer the control S2 cell culture medium to a fresh 15-mL or 50-mL conical tube.\nFollowing steps 3.4 - 3.7, clear the lysate of cells and cellular debris by centrifugation (at 2,500 x g at 4 °C for 30 min at a time) and then transfer the cleared cell lysate to concentrators and centrifuge them to concentrate the control medium in batches to 1/10th the original volume.",
    "NOTE: Application of the S2-conditioned media does not lead to substantial cell contractility in the assay.\nStore the concentrated S2 control media at 4 °C for several months.\n\tNOTE: After storage, be sure to monitor for the contamination.\n4. Preparation of Concanavalin-A-coated Glass-bottomed Dishes and the Plating of S2R+ Cells\nMake 10 mL of the concanavalin A (con A) solution by dissolving 5 mg of con A into 10 mL of water for a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Aliquot this solution into more convenient volumes (500 µL to 1 mL) and store it at -20 °C.\nPrepare 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes by coating the glass portion of each dish with 200 µL of the con A solution and incubate the dishes for approximately 2 min at room temperature in a tissue culture hood. Next, remove all the con A solution (which can be retained and reused for future experiments) and allow the dishes to air-dry completely.\n\tNOTES: Dishes can be prepared in large batches and can be stored for up to 6 months in a dry place such as a lab bench drawer.\nAdd approximately 2 mL of fresh cell culture media to each glass-bottomed dish. Resuspend the S2R+ cells to be tested by the assay by pipetting the cell culture medium up and down, using it to detach any loosely adhering cells.\nTransfer the resuspended S2R+ cells to the 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes containing the fresh cell culture medium so they are between 50% - 70% confluent. Check the cell density under the tissue culture microscope by focusing up and down through several plains of the cells suspended in the medium to get an estimate of the number of cells.\n\tNOTE: Through trial and error, the appropriate density of cells needed to achieve 50% - 70% confluency can be achieved.",
    "Allow the cells to attach to the con-A-coated glass-bottomed dishes for 45 - 60 min.\n\tNOTE: Fully attached S2R+ cells appear 'fried-egg-like,' flattened and phase-dark.\n5. Efficacy Test of the Fog-conditioned Medium, and the Cellular Contractility Assay\nIf desired, confirm the yield of Fog-Myc produced and concentrated from the S2:Fog-Myc stable cells lines by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Add 10 µL of SDS-containing sample buffer to 10 µL of concentrated Fog-Myc and boil it for 5 min. Follow the standard SDS-PAGE and western blotting protocols and blot for anti-Myc to confirm Fog-Myc production.\nRemove all the Shield and Sang M3 medium from the attached S2R+ cells from step 4.3 by gently pipetting, and carefully add back 75 µL of fresh Shield and Sang medium to limit the amount of Fog-conditioned medium used.\nAdd 75 µL of Fog-conditioned media to the glass portion of the glass-bottomed dish from step 5.2 to bring the total volume to 150 µL, at a 1:1 ratio of Fog-conditioned media to Shield and Sang M3 media.\n\tNOTE: A total volume of 150 - 200 µL is needed to fully cover the glass portion of a typical glass-bottomed dish; however, this will depend on the dimensions of the glass-bottomed dish used.\nMonitor the contractility of the cells by phase-contrast microscopy using 20X or 40X magnification to observe an entire field of cells. Track the morphology of the cells and look for the alternating pattern of phase dark and phase light ruffling indicative of the shape change.\n\tNOTE: The application of Fog typically leads to 30% - 50% of the S2R+ cells undergoing cellular constriction, and after 10 min, the cells begin to relax, returning to their smooth-edged, fried-egg-like morphology.",
    "Monitor the robustness of the cellular contractility. If the cell response is very strong using a 1:1 ratio of Fog-conditioned medium to fresh Shield and Sang medium, reduce the amount of Fog-conditioned medium to conserve the concentrated Fog-Myc medium for future experiments. Use undiluted Fog-conditioned medium if a 1:1 ratio does not lead to robust cellular constriction; generally, a ratio of 1:3 produces enough response to successfully carry out the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Once the appropriate ratio of Fog-conditioned medium to fresh Shield and Sang medium is established per given batch of Fog-conditioned medium, use this ratio for all other experiments.\nMonitor non-muscle myosin II dynamics during the cellular contractility assay by using the stable S2R+ cell line that expresses GFP-tagged regulatory light chain (S2R+:Sqh-EGFP).\nUsing the established ratio of Fog-conditioned medium to fresh Shield and Sang M3 medium from steps 5.2 - 5.5, remove cell-cultured medium with a pipette and add back fresh Shield and Sang medium in the glass portion of the glassed-bottomed dish. Perfuse Fog-conditioned medium at the predetermined ratio while acquiring an image sequence of the live cells; take care as to not move the glass-bottomed dish during the perfusion.\n6. Fixing and Staining of Constricted S2R+ Cells\nFix S2R+ cells using a 10% paraformaldehyde solution in PEM buffer (100 mM Pipes, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 6.9).\n\tNOTE: PEM buffer is typically made at 2x stock solution and can be stored for months at 4 °C.\nRemove the cell culture medium from Fog-treated S2R+ cells by pipetting and immediately replace it with 1.5 - 2.0 mL of 10% paraformaldehyde solution. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature.",
    "NOTE: Fixed cells can be stored in fixation solution at 4 °C for several days; however, it is important that the initial 15-min fixation is done at room temperature prior to transferring the cells to 4 °C.\nRemove the 10% paraformaldehyde solution by pipetting and dispose of this organic waste product properly. Rinse the cells by gently pipetting 1.5 - 2.0 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the 35-mm glass-bottomed dish. Remove the old PBS by pipetting and replace it with 1.5 - 2.0 mL of fresh PBS 2x more to remove residual fixation solution.\n\tNOTE: It is important that the cells do not dry out from this point on in the protocol.\nBlock the cells with approximately 200 µL of 5% normal goat serum diluted in PBS that has been supplemented with 0.1% non-ionic detergent (PBST) for 20 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Typically, blocking solutions contain serum that matches the organism the secondary antibodies are raised in.\nPrepare the primary antibody solution by diluting it in PBST. Use a volume of approximately 200 µL to completely cover the glass portion of the glass-bottomed dish.\n\t\nRemove the blocking solution by pipetting and add the primary antibody solution directly to the glass portion of the dish. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature or, alternatively, incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nWhen incubating overnight at 4 °C, wrap the 35-mm glass-bottomed dish with parafilm to prevent evaporation.\nRemove the primary antibody solution by pipetting and rinse the cells by pipetting 1.5 - 2.0 mL of fresh PBS to the 35-mm glass-bottomed dish. Remove PBS by pipetting and replace it with 1.5 - 2.0 mL of fresh PBS 2x more.",
    "Prepare a solution of secondary antibody by diluting it in PBST. A volume of 200 µL is adequate to just cover the glass portion of the dish.\n\t\nAdd the secondary antibody solution directly to the glass portion of the dish. Incubate the cells with secondary antibody solution for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nWrap the 35-mm dish with parafilm if incubating overnight, to prevent evaporation.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution by pipetting and rinse the cells with PBS by pipetting 1.5 - 2.0 mL of fresh PBS to the dish. Remove the old PBS and replace it 2x more, following this same procedure.\nPreserve the fixed and stained cells by adding enough of an anti-fade fluorescent mounting medium to cover the glass portion of the glass-bottomed 35-mm dish.\nStore the samples at 4 °C and away from light.\n\tNOTE: The fluorescent signal will slowly decay over months even if properly stored. For best results, image within a week.\n7. Imaging and Quantification of the Cellular Contractility Assay\nImage fixed S2R+ cells using a standard inverted light microscope with phase contrast, DIC, or fluorescence imaging capabilities. Using 20X or 40X magnification, capture 10 - 30 nonoverlapping image fields of cells depending on the cell density, with the goal of acquiring the images of 200 or more cells per condition.\nUsing a standard cell counter, count and record the number of contracted (phase-dark, bonneted cells) and noncontracted cells per each field captured.\n\tNOTE: It is best to have two researchers take independent counts of contracted and noncontracted cells per field, or alternatively, the same researcher can count the same image field of cells three times, allowing for an average number of contracted and noncontracted cells per field to be calculated.",
    "Prepare several con-A-coated glass-bottomed dishes per experimental condition as described in step 4.2. Pipette up and down the cell culture medium to dislodge any loosely adherent S2R+:Sqh-EGFP cells and plate them so they are 50% - 70% confluent in the 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes. Allow the cells to attach for 30 - 45 minutes.\nImage the S2R+:Sqh-EGFP cells live using a spinning-disk, swept-field confocal microscope, or by light-sheet microscopy using 60X - 100X magnification. Remove all the Shield and Sang M3 medium from the glass-bottomed dish containing attached S2R+:Sqh-EGFP cells.\n\t\nPerfuse the predetermined ratio of Fog-Myc conditioned medium to fresh Shield and Sang M3 medium from steps 5.2 - 5.5 directly onto the glass portion of the glass-bottomed dish using a pipette, careful as to not to disturb the position of the dish on the objective. Acquire images for 12 - 15 min in order to capture the initiation and full contraction of the S2R+:Sqh-EGFP cells.\n\t\tNote: If staining for non-muscle myosin or myosin-pRLC, the formation of a tight myosin ring at the surface of the cells is also indicative of contractility. If imaging S2R+:Sqh-EGFP cells live, the EGFP-tagged RLC will form similar tight rings (see Figure 3) indicative of contractility. The shape change that occurs will cause the cells to \"bonnet\", taking up 3D shape; the plane of focus of the microscope may need to be adjusted to track this cell shape change. Under control RNAi conditions, typically, 30% - 50% of the cells undergo constriction upon the addition of Fog. Be aware that some RNAi conditions may lead to constriction in the absence of Fog."
