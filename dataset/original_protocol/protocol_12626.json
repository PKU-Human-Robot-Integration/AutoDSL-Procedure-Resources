    "Animal care and experimentation were performed according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n1. Preparation of tissue digestion and lysis buffers\nPrepare tissue digestion buffer.\n\t\nPrepare ~1 mL of digestion buffer for every gram of adipose tissue.\nWeigh out 1.5 U/mL collagenase D and 2.4 U/mL dispase II and add phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nPrepare nuclei preparation buffer (NPB).\n\t\nPrepare 10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM potassium chloride, 250 mM sucrose, and 0.1% NP-40 in nuclease-free water. Mix well. Sucrose may take more time to dissolve than the other components.\nPrepare 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution.\n\t\nPrepare 0.5% BSA in PBS containing EDTA. It is recommended to use sterile-filtered cell culture grade PBS (see Table of Materials).\n2. Enzymatic digestion of adipose tissue\nDissect mice to extract adipose tissue according to Aune et al.13. Collect isolated tissue in a dish containing PBS. Transfer the tissue to a paper towel to pat dry. Then place the tissue in a clean dish.\nAdd calcium chloride to the digestion buffer to a final concentration of 10 mM. Add a small volume of digestion buffer to the dish and thoroughly mince the adipose tissue. The volume of digestion buffer required will be based on the amount of tissue isolated. Usually ~1 mL or less is used.",
    "Add about half of the amount of prepared digestion buffer (e.g., ~10 mL for five mice) to the minced tissue. Using a serological pipette, transfer the sample to a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. Add any remaining amount of buffer to wash the dish and transfer to the 50 mL tube containing the sample. Pipette up and down several times. Then incubate with shaking at 200-210 rpm at 37 °C for 12-15 min.\n3. Adipocyte isolation\nAfter incubation, add 0.5% BSA at a 1:1 ratio to the sample. Mix well by pipetting up and down several times. Centrifuge the sample at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT) to spin down the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). The adipocyte fraction will remain in the top layer of the sample.\nPlace a 40 µm cell filter on top of a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube and filter the sample, collecting the top layer and leaving behind the SVF at the bottom of the tube. Transfer the top layer (adipocyte fraction) to a new tube by flipping the filter upside down over the tube and using 0.5% BSA to reverse wash the filter and collect the sample in the tube.\nBring the total volume of 0.5% BSA to 10-15 mL based on sample size and pipette up and down with a serological pipette or briefly shake up and down to mix the sample. Centrifuge the sample again at 300 x g for 5 min at RT.\n4. Nuclei isolation\nUse a wide-bore pipette tip and carefully transfer the top layer of the sample to a 100 µm cell filter placed on top of a new prechilled tube on ice, leaving behind any residual SVF.",
    "Rinse/wash the filter with a sufficient amount of NPB and discard the filter. From this step forward have the sample on ice as often as possible and work quickly to avoid leaky and/or unhealthy nuclei. It is helpful to prechill microcentrifuge tubes to be used in future steps on ice.\nPlace the sample on ice for no more than 2 min with intermittent gentle inverting of the tube to mix. The incubation time on ice should be optimized for sample size and type of adipocytes. Centrifuge at 1,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of NPB. Transfer the sample to a clean microcentrifuge tube. While transferring, avoid touching the walls of the tube, which contain debris and lipid. Add 0.6 U/µL RNase inhibitor to the sample and mix. Centrifuge again at 1,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Centrifugation speed and time should be decreased at this step for smaller samples.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of Nuclei Wash Buffer (2% BSA/PBS + 0.6 U/µL RNase inhibitor).\nDouble filter into a clean tube with stackable 30 µm filters. Wash filter with a small volume (~300 µL) of Nuclei Wash Buffer. Alternatively, for smaller samples, use a 30 µm filter that fits into a microcentrifuge tube and filter directly into it.\nConfirm successful isolation of healthy nuclei.\n\t\nStain a small aliquot of the sample with trypan and use an automated cell counter to assess average dead size and percent dead cells. Average dead size for a sample containing mostly nuclei should range between 7-10 µm. Nuclei size is usually around 8 µm.",
    "Stain a small aliquot of the sample with DAPI and examine under a microscope with a 20x objective or higher. The nuclear membrane should be intact and the nuclei should be round.\n5. FACS cleanup and nuclei concentration step\nProceed immediately to the FACS step to clean up nuclei and remove any excess debris. The collection buffer should contain Nuclei Wash Buffer. During FACS the buffer is diluted. Preparing a higher concentration of BSA and RNase inhibitor to account for dilution during sorting is helpful. The FACS collection block should be on cooling mode.\nAfter sorting the nuclei, centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to concentrate the sample. Reconstitute in an appropriate volume of Nuclei Wash Buffer to achieve a concentration of 500-1,500 nuclei/µL. Do not attempt to remove all the supernatant. Doing so will result in loss of nuclei.\nUse a hemocytometer and a DAPI stained aliquot for a final count and to visualize the nuclei. Then proceed immediately with snRNA-seq according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
