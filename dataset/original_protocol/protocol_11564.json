    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the local ethics committee of the University of Marburg; for all reported studies19,20,21, approval was obtained. Obtain approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB), with special attention to potential intrusiveness of study participation on daily-life routines and with special attention to the collection of salivary biomarkers for stress.\n1. Study Design: Sampling Protocol\nDecide on the number of days, as most studies involving multiple assessments typically run from 3 d to 3 weeks22. Choose multiple consecutive days (e.g., at least 7 d, to encompass both weekdays and weekend days) in order to gain representative insights into the daily life of the participants.\nDecide on a number of assessments per day. Distribute assessments over the day, spanning representative periods between awakening and bedtime (e.g., 6 assessments/d).\nDecide on the distribution of assessments per day (e.g., assessments can either be event-based, time-based, or a combination of these two designs)9.\nNOTE: Keep in mind that current recommendations prefer event-based procedures for the sampling of rare events only, mostly for the reason of compliance and to keep up the motivation of participants. Use a combination of event-based and time-based assessments.\n\t\nDue to the diurnal rhythm of salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase, use an event-based assessment directly after waking up.\nRelative to this assessment, schedule one subsequent assessment 30 min after waking up and schedule further fixed assessments at 12:00 h (before lunch), 14:00 h, 18:00 h, and 21:00 h (bedtime).\nNOTE: The study protocol described here scheduled the following assessments in each study: directly after awakening (event-based), 30 min after awakening, 10.0019,21/11.0020 (fixed), 14.00 (fixed), 18.00 (fixed), 21.00 (fixed).\n2. Selection of Participants\nPerform an a priori power analysis, as recommended by Bolger, Stadler, and Laurenceau23, if one has a priori knowledge on the expected effect sizes.",
    "Cautiously select the study participants and define the following inclusion criteria:\n\t\nEnsure that the participants' age range is as narrow as possible (e.g., 18 to 35 years of age) or consider it to be a confound and treat it statistically as such. Participants' Body Mass Index (BMI) should be equal to or lower than 30 (see step 3.1). The participants should either be nonsmokers or should smoke less than five cigarettes per week.\nMake sure to only include participants who do not consume drugs (no consumption of cannabis within the last 2 weeks, no consumption of any other psychotropic substances within the last 4 weeks). Furthermore, ensure that the participant does not take any medication (except for Hormonal Contraceptives (HC) in females, which should be recorded and considered within statistical analyses).\nOnly include participants who do not have any chronic somatic or psychiatric disease (according to self-reports based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 24.\nNOTE: If interested in the effects of music listening on psychobiological stress in specific patient populations (e.g., patients with fibromyalgia syndrome), please adjust these inclusion criteria (e.g., define inclusion criteria for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome based on the research criteria25,26).\nAssess the following covariates.\nNOTE: Covariates should be assessed once using paper-and-pencil questionnaires.\n\t\nDue to the assessment of biological parameters, control for BMI and gender. Either define inclusion criteria regarding BMI and gender (e.g., include only those subjects who have a BMI equal to or lower than 30, or include only men or women), or statistically control for the influence of BMI and gender.",
    "Concerning the association between music listening and stress, control for musical expertise and music preference (e.g., by means of the Music Preference Questionnaire (MPQ))27 in order to test hypotheses on differential effects concerning the association between music listening and stress based on personal music preference and expertise.\nAsk participants to complete the Trier Inventory for Chronic Stress28 and/or the Perceived Stress Scale29 to test hypotheses regarding the influence of overall stress levels on the association between music listening and current stress.\n3. Meeting with the Participants before the Assessment\nSchedule an introductory session with the participants to familiarize them with the electronic diary device, questionnaires, and saliva collection method.\nProvide participants with a mobile electronic diary device on which they can address the items occurring during the ambulatory assessment\n\t\nFamiliarize all participants with how to handle the electronic diary device.\nProvide each participant with information on how the mobile electronic diary device is used (e.g., how to turn it on and off, how to mute and unmute the alarm, how to react when an assessment is missed, how frequently to recharge it and how to start the application presenting the items).\nExplain and demonstrate all functions concerning the study.\nPrepare a study manual in which the study material, the items occurring in the ambulatory assessment, and the procedure for the collection of saliva are explained in sufficient detail. In this manual, describe each item in detail by explaining each response option.\nNOTE: Make sure to do a trial run and review the manual with each participant. Thus, provide particular instructions to the participant, both face-to-face and written in the manual, before the assessment period starts.\nProvide the participant with contact details in case of technical problems.\nInstruct the participant to start the first assessment the day following the introductory session.",
    "Set a date for the postmonitoring session after completion of data collection.\n4. Items on Music Listening\nNOTE: All items on music listening are presented via the electronic diary device.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54920/54920fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Exemplary Screenshots from Mobile Diary Devices. Using electronic diary devices, participants can be investigated in their daily lives while they go about their daily routines. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54920/54920fig1large.jpg]\nFirst, use a filter question and ask whether music listening has occurred since the last assessment.\nDefine what is meant by music listening by providing examples for music listening in daily life. Distinguish between passive music listening (e.g., background music while shopping) and active or deliberate music listening (e.g., music listening that is in the focus of attention).\nAsk subsequent items (e.g., valence, arousal, and reasons for music listening) that cover a more in-depth characterization of the music listening episode when participants report having listened to music.\n\t\nAsk for the perceived valence (ranging from sad to happy on a visual analogue scale) and perceived arousal (ranging from relaxing to energizing on a visual analogue scale) of the music that was listened to.\nAsk the participant to define two qualitative characteristics of the music they listened to using different response scales. On the one hand, ask them to rate whether the experience is sad or happy. On the other hand, ask whether the music is relaxing or energizing.\nNOTE: The ratings refer to the participant's subjective experience of the music.\nAsk the participant to try to make a rating. If this is not possible, ask the participant to choose the middle of the scale.",
    "In case the participant listens to more than one piece of music, please ask the participant to make a rating representing the majority of music listened to. That is, if the participant listens to both sad and happy music on the radio, ensure that the classification represents the predominant experience of the music.\nAssess the reasons for music listening by asking the participant to choose the main reason for music listening (among relaxation, distraction, activation, and reducing boredom).\nNOTE: We selected the reasons for music listening that have been reported most frequently in previous research5,6. Depending on the research question, other reasons may be chosen as well (e.g., emotion regulation, aesthetic enjoyment, and cognitive stimulation). However, please remember to keep the number of items to a minimum in order to maintain high compliance with the protocol.\n\t\nAsk the following questions:\nAsk if the participant listened to music in order to relax.\nNOTE: This can be due to some prior stressful event or to the general need to relax.\nAsk if the participant listened to music for activation.\nNOTE: For example, this means that music was chosen to sing along to, to move with, or to activate oneself.\nAsk if the participant listened to music for distraction.\nNOTE: Meaning, to distract from a certain topic or from certain thoughts.\nAsk if the participant listened to music because there were no other alternatives available for reducing boredom.\nNOTE: In contrast to distraction as the reason for music listening, here, music is not meant to distract from a certain topic or thoughts. Rather, music is listened to in order to pass time.\nAssess the characteristics of the listening situation.\n\t\nAsk the participant who else was present during listening to music.",
    "NOTE: In accordance to Juslin et al.6, ask the participant to choose among the following response options: \"I was alone while listening to music,\" \"Friends were present while listening to music,\" and \"Acquaintances were present while listening to music.\"\nAdditionally, ask whether the participant was in the presence of strangers while listening to music6.\nNOTE: If anyone is specifically interested in the role of social context factors on the stress-reducing effect of music listening, consider asking the participant whether interactions with other people occurred and how these interactions are rated (negative-positive). Furthermore, assess social support/attachment to determine whether these factors moderate the stress-reducing effect of music listening.\nConsult the appropriate literature on studies investigating music listening in daily life to learn more about these context variables6,18.\n5. Assessment of Psychobiological Stress\nNOTE: Stress is a multidimensional phenomenon that is assessed via subjective self-report as well as via physiological markers of stress. At each assessment, both data on subjective stress levels and on physiological markers of stress must be collected.\nMeasure subjective stress using a single-item30 indicating how stressed they feel at the moment (e.g., on a five-point Likert scale ranging from \"not at all\" to \"very much\").\nNOTE: This item should be presented using the electronic diary device.\nImmediately after having provided subjective information on music listening and stress, collect saliva samples for the later assessment of salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase as neuroendocrine and autonomic stress markers, respectively, using standard procedures.\nNOTE: There are commercially available assays for both analytes, e.g., enzyme linked immunosorbent assays.\nPreparation of saliva vials\nNOTE: For the concomitant assessment of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase, use the passive drool method, which controls for the effects of mastication, textual stimulation, or interferences of absorbent material with assay procedures31.",
    "Prelabel the saliva vials. Use a simple, unique code for each vial.\nNOTE: This code consists of the study number + participant code + day of sampling + time of day.\nWeigh the saliva vials both before and after study participation to determine the salivary flow rate (which is calculated by determining the saliva volume (the post- to pre-weight difference) divided by the collection time (mL/min)). \nSplit the samples according to the day of sampling by placing all samples from one day and the corresponding numbers of straws into a small plastic bag.\nSaliva Collection\n\t\nProvide participants with particular instructions for the saliva collection as follows.\n\t\t\nIn order to avoid contamination with blood, sugar, or acidity, instruct the participants not to brush their teeth within 30 min prior to saliva sampling or to have dental treatment 24 h before saliva sampling.\nNOTE: Major meals should not be consumed within 60 min prior to sampling; snacks and caffeinated or alcoholic beverages should not be consumed within 30 min prior to sampling.\nDocument the intake of food, drinks, and nicotine by means of the mobile electronic diary device by asking if the participate ate/drank/smoked within the last two hours (0: \"no,\" 1: \"yes\").\nInstruct the participants to rinse their mouth with tap water 10 min prior to sampling.\nInstruct the participants to document vigorous physical activity 2 h prior to sampling. Ask the participants if they were active. If yes, ask how active they have been during the last 2 h. Instruct the participants to respond with \"not at all,\" \"very little,\" \"moderately,\" or \"vigorously.\"",
    "Instruct the participant to store the samples at or below -20 °C as soon as possible (on the evening of each day at the latest) to prevent bacterial growth. In case participants do not have immediate access to a freezer, they should be asked to store the samples in a refrigerator in the meantime.\nCollect a saliva sample for demonstration purposes.\n\t\t\nAsk the participant to swallow once. Then, ask the participant to accumulate saliva by not swallowing for the next 2 min.\nSet a timer (2 min are usually sufficient) on the mobile electronic diary device.\nHold the vial and straw ready. After 2 min, ask the participant to transfer all accumulated saliva into the vial.\nNOTE: Participants can either use the straw to transfer all accumulated saliva into the vial, or they can transfer all accumulated saliva without the straw into the vial.\nThen, ask the participant to enter the code written on the vial as a compliance check at the end of each assessment time point.\n6. Meeting with the Participants after the Assessment\nAsk participants to return to the laboratory to hand over the study equipment after study completion (i.e. the electronic diary device and the saliva samples).\nConduct a standardized post-monitoring interview asking for any problems that may have occurred during the study, interference of study participation with daily-life routines, and overall satisfaction with the study participation.\n7. Statistical Handling\nPrepare the data set by excluding participants with less than 50% of the assessments completed.\nCheck the data for a normal distribution. As salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase are usually not normally distributed, transform the data (e.g., using the formula ln(x) + 10).",
    "NOTE: Due to the nested structure of the data (i.e. repeatedly-assessed music listening and psychobiological stress are nested in each person), analyze the data using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM)32 in accordance with the procedure described by Woltman, Feldstain, MacKay, and Rocchi33. Analyses should at least control for the time of day on level-1 and for BMI and gender on level-2. Calculate the amount of explained variance as an indicator for effect size using the formula provided by Singer and Willet34.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
