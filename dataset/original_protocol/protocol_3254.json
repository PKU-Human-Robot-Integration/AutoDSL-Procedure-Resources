Identifying optimal trimming depth in mouse brains\n(A) Mount OCT-embedded brains in the cryostat to trim from ventral side of the brain. A colored laboratory pen is used to label the OCT block. Different colors should be used for different brains.\n(B) View of brain when sufficient trimming is achieved.\n(C) Optimal trimming depth is reached when the brainstem appears to come in contact with the hypothalamus. The midbrain flexure will be apparent (red arrow) between the hypothalamus and brainstem.\n(D) Allen Brain Atlas view of optimal trimming depth with focus on brainstem coming together with hypothalamus (red arrow indicates location of expected midbrain flexure).3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nPosition the first sample in the cryostat so that the ventral surface of the brain is the face being cut.\nTrim brain 1 from the ventral side to such depth that the brainstem and the hypothalamus appear to touch (separated by the midbrain flexure) in the same plane (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B–1D).\nUse a single-edge razor to cut the brain in half down the sagittal plane (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3022-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dividing the brain into right and left hemispheres\n(A) Allen Brain Atlas view of the path of the incision through the midline of the brain (red-dotted line).\n(B) Use a razer chilled in the cryostat to cut the brain in half (make the cut as straight as possible).\n(C) The resulting cut should be right through the middle of the brain.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]",
    "Remove the 2 halves of brain 1 from the mounting block (use a spatula or tweezers).\nComplete steps 1–5 for brains 2, 3, and 4.\nSelect one half of brain 1 and a mirroring half from brain 2 that you want to merge together.\nMount each selected brain half from Step 7 to a separate cryostat chuck with OCT, ensuring the midsagittal plane is face up (with a single-edge razor, trim any excess OCT that obstructs mounting the brain half in this orientation). This enables the user to handle each brain half by holding onto the chuck, rather than the sample itself.\nPractice aligning the brain halves by matching the midbrain flexure of each brain (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Note that samples warm quickly when handled in the cryostat, so the user must align the brains quickly during the merging process.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3022-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Alignment of 2 brain halves\n(A) The landmark to align the brain halves to each other is the midbrain flexure (circled in red).\n(B) Practice aligning the brains together by joining the 2 brains together at the brainstem (red circle). Do this before applying OCT and attempting to join the 2 halves.\nGently warm up the sagittal face of each sample to be merged. The user can do this by tapping a room-temperature spatula (treated with 70% ethanol and RNaseZap) on the sagittal face of the brain half just until the OCT starts to soften (the brain should remain frozen).\nApply a thin layer of OCT to the sagittal face of the brain 1 half. Firmly press the sagittal face of the brain 2 half into the OCT on the brain 1 half, making sure to align the midbrain flexure.",
    "Allow the OCT of the merged halves for brains 1 and 2 to refreeze in the cryostat. Remove the brains from each cryostat chuck one chuck at a time (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3022-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Merging of 2 brain halves with OCT\nThe thin layer of OCT should be applied to the sagittal face of the brains. Spillover along the full length of the brain indicates proper distribution of OCT. Remove the cryostat chucks from these merged halves one at a time.\nMerge the remaining halves for brains 3 and 4 using Steps 9–13.\nRemount the merged halves for brains 1 and 2 on the cryostat so that the ventral surface is the face being cut.\nShave the bottom face of the merged brains until 2 sets of ventricles appear (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3022-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Discard rostral part of the block.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3022-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "If storing the assembled brain block for future processing, apply a thin coat of OCT on exposed brain areas. Allow the OCT to set before putting the brain block into a sealed container at −80°C (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C).\nA 50 mL conical tube works well as a storage container for the brain blocks"
