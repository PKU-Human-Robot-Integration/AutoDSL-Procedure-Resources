    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nLangendorff System Preparation\nTiming: 30 min\nCritical: Pre-warm and oxygenate the perfusion solutions.\nBefore isolation, we need to fill up the Langendorff apparatus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (Liu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), including circulating pipes, with 75% ethanol and soakfor 1–2 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/103-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The Schematic Diagram of the Langendorff Perfusion System for Cardiomyocytes Isolation\nNote: For the first use, the Langendorff device should be soaked with 25% bleach for at least 12 h to sterilize the system.\nSwitch on the water bath to warm up the water bath-jacketed tubes of the Langendorff system to keep the circulating perfusion solution at 37°C into the heart.\nNote: The temperature of the perfusate should also be checked regularly (Plačkić and Kockskämper, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nRinse the system 3 times with sterilized ddH20, and empty the system after each wash.\nFill Ca2+ KHB (∼80 mL) and Ca2+-free KHB (∼80 mL) into their containers (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nTurn on the oxygen to oxygenate all solutions that are going to be used for perfusion to maintain sufficient O2 supply.\nPut all the surgical tools in a beaker with 75 % ethanol, and prepare heparin sodium solution and sodium pentobarbital solution.\nFill a 60 mm petri dish with Ca2+ KHB, and place it on ice.\nAspirate an appropriate amount (3–4 mL) of Ca2+ KHB to a 5 mL syringe, which connects to the cannula, with care to avoid introducing air bubbles.\nFix the 5 mL syringe on the iron stand, adjust the height so that the end of the cannula is inside the 60 mm petri dish, and then tie a surgical silk to the connecting site of the syringe for tying aorta.\nHold 50 mL of Ca2+ KHB with a small beaker on ice.",
    "Pause Point: The system is ready for use and is fine for a break up to 4 h.\nSurgery\nTiming: 30 min\nCritical: Use ice-cold solutions, cannulate the heart on ice to reduce heart beating. Appropriately cannulate the aorta.\nHeparinize rat (200–350 g) with sodium heparin intraperitoneally injected at 1000 U/kg to prevent the blood coagulation and the heart coronary embolism.\nNote: The weight of rat (correlated with age, generally, a 200–350 g rat is 6–8 weeks old) is crucial for the quality of the cardiomyocyte preparations. Less than 4 months old rat can be used for isolation.\nNote: Heparin as an anticoagulant can be used in vivo or in vitro. In some protocols, heparin has been added to the cannulation solution for use (Plačkić and Kockskämper, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). However, instead of using heparin in the cannulation solution, we injected heparin before harvesting the heart, which can let the anticoagulant blood flow into the coronary to prevent the formation of embolism.\nAfter 10 min, anesthetize the rat with sodium pentobarbital intraperitoneally injected at 80 mg/kg.\nWhen the rat is in deep sleep (∼5 min after injection and no response to toe pinch), spray chest and upper abdomen with 75 % ethanol, make a large incision on chest well, cut through ribs on both sides to fully expose heart and lung.\nQuickly remove the heart with the thymus and intact aortic arch. Removing the heart and some lung tissues together is better for saving time.\nPut the heart into the small beaker with ice-cold Ca2+ KHB, gently press the heart against beaker wall 2–3 times to squeeze blood out, transfer the heart to the 60 mm petri dish with ice-cold Ca2+ KHB.",
    "Carefully remove other tissues and clean up the aortic root (leave 3–5 mm long of the aorta) with forceps and scissors.\nCannulate the heart with the cannula, and ligate twice with the prepared surgical silk to ensure no solution leaks from the ligating site (Liu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCritical: Cannulating the heart quickly is crucial for the quality of the cardiomyocyte isolation. During the isolation procedure, the cannula should not be inserted too deeply into the aorta, as this could lead to mechanical damage of the aortic valve leaflets and cause inefficient perfusion and poor digestion of the heart. The total time from the heart is removed to mounted and perfused on the Langendorff system should be as short as possible to avoid cell damage caused by ischemia and hypoxia (Plačkić and Kockskämper, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). We recommend a time of less than 10 min and usually perform these steps within 5 min.\nSlowly inject Ca2+ KHB into the aorta to exclude blood from the coronary artery and the heart cavity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), and quickly hang the heart on the Langendorff apparatus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/103-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cannulation of the Heart\nNote: The cannula with the heart must be carefully connected to the Langendorff system to avoid introducing air bubbles.\nHeart Perfusion\nTiming: 50 min\nCritical: Ensure sufficient perfusion to dissociate cells from the heart tissue.\nPerfuse Ca2+ KHB for 5 min at high flow rate (1–2 drops/s) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/103-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Perfused Digestion of the Heart\n(A) The rat heart is perfused with the KHB solution.\n(B) Collagenase solution perfused heart.\nNote: Enough Ca2+ KHB perfusion time leads to better myocardial cell protection.\nSwitch to perfuse Ca2+-free KHB for 4–5 min at the high flow rate. The heart stops beating in 1 min.",
    "When there is around 60 mL Ca2+-free KHB left in the container, add 20 mL 4× Rat Collagenase Buffer to the Ca2+ -Free KHB container to mix with the Ca2+ -Free KHB to get a total 80 mL 1× collagenase buffer in the whole perfusion system. Set a 40 min timer.\nNote: Fill 60 mL solution into the Ca2+ -Free KHB container and mark the solution level on the container when you use it the first time.\nPut the heart in a small beaker (50 mL), set up a tube to recirculate Collagenase buffer (set up the peristaltic pump at a speed of ∼180 mL/min) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nAfter 5 min, add 80 μl CaCl2 (100 mM stock) into the beaker twice at 0.5–1 min interval (the final concentration of Ca2+ is 0.2 mM in 80 mL 1× collagenase buffer).\nNote: We found that a higher level of calcium ions stimulated the heart to continuously beating during digestion, which would cause the quality of isolated cardiomyocytes to decline.\nMonitor heart digestion: use the forceps to check the heart after the heart becomes swelling and white. Stop perfusion if the collagenase solution drops become quicker, and frequency reaches to 180–200 drops/min. In our experience, this process usually takes 35 min.\nNote: The duration of the collagenase digestion varies and could last any time between 25 and 50 min. It depends on several factors, including weight, age, and strain of rat or disease model (cardiac remodeling)\nEnzymatic Digestion (0.05% Trypsin-EDTA Solution)\nTiming: 20 min\nTake off perfused heart, and remove atrium and aorta, put the ventricular tissues in a small beaker with 10–15 mL enzyme solution (0.05% Trypsin-EDTA), and tear the ventricular tissue into small pieces with two fine-tip forceps (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/103-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Enzyme Further Digests Cardiac Tissue",
    "(A) The digested heart was cut off the atrium and aorta.\n(B and C) Myocardial tissue has been digested one time with enzyme (B); myocardial tissue has been digested three times with enzyme (C).\n(D) Collected cardiomyocytes in tubes.\nPipette the tissue gently with 1 mL pipette (cut tip), and put in an incubator at 37°C for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min, pipette the tissue again (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), take one drop tissue solution to check the digest efficiency and cell viability under a microscope, stop the digestion if >80% rod shape cells are present individually (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/103-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Purification and Culture of Cardiomyocytes\n(A) A representative image of cardiomyocytes collected from preliminary collagenase digestion of the cardiac. Scale bar, 100 μm.\n(B) A representative image of cardiomyocytes obtained from trypsin digestion. Scale bar, 100 μm.\n(C) A representative image of 1-day cultured cardiomyocytes. Scale bar, 30 μm.\n(D) Expanded image of cardiomyocytes. Scale bar, 20 μm.\nAllow the tissues to settle by gravity for 1 min, collect the supernatant from the beaker, and transfer to two or three 15 mL conical tubes so that each tube contains 5 mL of supernatant.\nAdd 5 mL Stop Buffer to the tube containing the 5 mL of supernatant, and pipette up and down 3 times to mix.\nAdd 10–15 mL 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution to the left precipitated cardiac tissue in the beaker; repeat steps 26 to 29 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nCollect the sediment of cardiomyocytes through gravity (pipette up and down to mix and wait for 3–4 min) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). This will partially remove other small cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells.\nNote: Repeat digestion with trypsin 1–2 times to get more myocytes if necessary.\nCardiomyocyte Purification\nTiming: 20 min",
    "Sequentially add 25 μl CaCl2 (100 mM stock) to cells in the conical tubes (each containing 10 mL solution) 3 times at 5 min intervals, mix well, and the fourth time add 50 μl CaCl2, and mix well.\nCollect the precipitated live cardiomyocytes through 30 g, 30 s centrifugation, and discard the supernatant. The left fibroblasts and endothelial cells are removed from myocytes’ sedimentation by centrifuge.\nResuspend cells with 2 mL culture medium and merge all cells into one tube, then replenish the culture medium to 10 mL and mix well. Now, these cells are ready for experiments or culture (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nPause Point: The cardiomyocytes in the medium can be incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2–3 h.\nCardiomyocytes Culture\nTiming: 40 min\nPre-coat the 6 well plates or dishes with 40 μg/mL laminin (1 mL per well) for 30 min.\nNote: This step should be done before cardiomyocyte purification for saving time.\nCount the cell number and plate cells with 500 μl culture medium per well at a density of 5 × 104 cells/mL, then incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nTwo hours later, after cardiomyocytes attached to the plate, gently change the medium with 2 mL fresh culture medium for continued culture (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C and 5D)."
