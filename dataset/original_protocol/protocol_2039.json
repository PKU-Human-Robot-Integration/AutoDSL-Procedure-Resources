    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of a tissue specimen\nTiming: 4–20 h\nThis part of the protocol describes initial tissue processing. The skin is cut into small pieces and digested in liberase.\nNote: Tissue specimen should be placed in sterile cold transport medium. The medium volume can be adjusted according to the tissue size. We commonly use 15 mL of medium for neonatal foreskin samples, and less for smaller adult samples, provided the tissue is completely immersed in the liquid. The tissue can be stored for a short period at 4°C in the tissue transport medium and we have successfully isolated cells from tissues stored this way for up to 48 h.\nThaw 0.5 mL liberase aliquot and mix it with 4.5 mL of cold CnT and double concentration of antibiotics (100 μL of penicillin/streptomycin and 20 μL of Gentamycin/Amphotericin B) in a 15 mL tube.\nCritical: The liberase mix should be cold to prevent over-digestion of the epidermis. This is particularly important for the adult samples.\nEmpty tissue and transport media into sterile 10 cm plate (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1632-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Initial tissue processing\n(A) Neonatal foreskin tissue in 10 cm dish.\n(B) Adult facial skin tissue samples from 92 and 63 years old male donors in 10 cm dishes and skin sample from 85 years old male in 6 cm dish.\n(C) Neonatal foreskin cut open into a single sheet.\n(D) Neonatal tissue cut into small pieces for liberase digestion.\nNote: Neonatal tissues are usually larger than adult ones. Adult skin samples often contain large fat deposits which should be trimmed. Adult epidermis is thin and fragile, and it should be handled with care.\nPrepare the tissue according to neonatal foreskin protocol a, or adult tissue protocol b.\nNeonatal foreskin protocol.",
    "Using sterile scissors and forceps, cut down the midline of the foreskin to open to a single sheet (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nNote: Meticulous clean-up is not required – although this helps penetration of enzyme. Any large blood clots can be removed but removing further tissue is not advised as it reduces cell yield, particularly for microvascular endothelial cells.\nAdult tissue protocol.\nUsing sterile scissors and forceps trim any fat from the dermis layer.\nCritical: The fat should be removed completely as it will interfere with liberase digestion.\nCollect trimmed fat into a tube and add some of the tissue transport medium to keep the fat submerged and store at 4 °C.\nNote: The fat is well-vascularized and its inclusion in the isolation of microvascular endothelial cells and preadipocytes significantly increases cell yield.\nCut the tissue into pieces of 5–6 mm2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCritical: The pieces should never be more than 7 mm in diameter to ensure efficient penetration of liberase. The tissue can be cut into smaller pieces if faster digestion time is required.\nNote: It is better to cut tissue pieces into strips rather than squares as it improves enzyme penetration. Avoid cutting tissue into very small pieces as it makes it very hard to distinguish epidermis from the dermis, especially for light colored skin samples.\nTransfer the tissue pieces into 15 mL tube with liberase solution and invert gently.\nIncubate the tissue for 16–20 h at 4 °C with the tube lying on its side to ensure that all the pieces are completely submerged.\nNeonatal foreskin protocol.\nAlternatively, for same-day processing, incubation can be done at 19 °C–21°C with slow rotation of the tube for 3–4 h.\nNote: Same-day processing is not recommended for adult tissues as it usually leads to over-digestion of epidermis and poor keratinocytes recovery.",
    "Pause point: There is a stopping point when tissue is digested in liberase.\nPrimary cell isolation\nTiming: 4 h\nAfter digestion in liberase, the epidermis is peeled off from the dermis and both are enzymatically digested and physically manipulated to produce single cells suspensions. Keratinocytes and melanocytes are isolated from epidermis, whereas dermis is the source for fibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells and preadipocytes.\nCritical: Make sure all vessels are coated before starting this step.\nThaw an aliquot of collagenase.\nPrepare three 6 cm dishes, add 5 mL of HBSS to one of them, 3 mL of trypsin to another and leave the third one empty.\nDecant the digested tissue pieces into an empty 6 cm dish (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1632-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Tissue processing after liberase digestion\n(A) Neonatal foreskin tissue in 6 cm dish after 16–20 h digestion in liberase. Please note that the tissue pieces are less compact now.\n(B) Epidermis and dermis separated, please note that dermis pieces have pale, “top” side and vascularized “bottom” side.\n(C) Mechanically disintegrated epidermis, epidermis pieces are no longer floating on the surface of the solution.\n(D) Pieces of dermis prepared for fibroblast outgrowth, the vascularized side of dermis should be facing up.\n(E) Minced dermis prepared for collagenase digestion.\n(F) Digested epidermis repeatedly pipetted up and down to release cells from the tissue. Note that solution became cloudy. It is normal to see pieces of epidermis still remaining in the plate.\nTake one piece of tissue at a time and hold the dermis with a pair of forceps and peel the epidermis layer off with another pair of forceps; place the epidermis in the dish with trypsin and transfer the dermis to the dish with HBSS (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "Critical: Adult epidermis is more fragile and more prone to tearing than neonatal ones; be gentle.\nNote: When digestion is complete, epidermis should separate in one piece when pulled gently from the corner. If this does not happen, continue incubation of the tissue with liberase for another hour at 4 °C.\nWhen all epidermis and dermis pieces are separated, use the back of the curved forceps to pull apart/rub the epidermis on the bottom on the dish to remove as many large floating pieces of epidermis as possible (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nIncubate the epidermis for 10 min at 19 °C–21°C to digest it.\nIn the meantime, prepare the dermis for fibroblast isolation.\nNeonatal foreskin protocol.\nPlace 2–3 pieces of the dermis with the de-epidermized (pale) side face down in the 10 cm uncoated plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nLeave the dish open in the hood for about 15 min to dry the tissue slightly to help it attach to the plate.\nAdd 1 mL of warm fibroblast medium supplemented with double concentration of antibiotics to the plate to almost cover the tissue pieces but not entirely.\nNote: Be careful not to dislodge attached dermis pieces, they should not be floating in the dish.\nCarefully place the dish in the tissue culture incubator.\nAt the end of the day carefully add 4 mL of warm fibroblast medium supplemented with double concentration of antibiotics to the plate.\nAdult tissue protocol.\nIf the tissue is sufficiently large to yield at least 3 pieces in step 4, (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), place a piece of de-epidermized (pale) dermis side face down in gelatin-coated well of a 6-well plate (aspirate gelatin from the plate before placing the piece of tissue).\nLeave the dish open in the hood for about 15 min to dry tissue slightly to help it attach.",
    "Add 0.25 mL of warm fibroblast medium supplemented with double concentration of antibiotics to the plate concentrating on tissue piece.\nNote: Be careful not to dislodge attached dermis pieces, they should not be floating in the dish.\nCarefully place the dish in the tissue culture incubator.\nAt the end of the day, carefully add 0.25 mL more of warm fibroblast medium supplemented with double concentration of antibiotics to the plate.\nNote: Growing adult fibroblasts from explants yields purer population than growing them from CD31, CD34 negative fraction (point 51b), however they grow very slowly and have lower proliferation potential.\nMince the remaining dermis pieces with scissors (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) and transfer the pieces into a tube with collagenase.\nAdult tissue protocol.\nMince with scissors any fat trimmings from the previous day and combine it with dermis pieces.\nUse 2.5 mL of collagenase solution for digestion.\nDigest dermis pieces in 37 °C water bath with frequent agitation until the tissue is completely digested (between 45 min and 1.5 h).\nAdult tissue protocol.\nAfter about 30 min of incubation the fat layer will appear on the top of the tube. Centrifuge the tube at 250 g for 5 min at 19 °C–21°C and aspirate the fat layer together with the supernatant.\nAdd the remaining 2.5 mL of collagenase solution to the tissue pieces and continue digestion until tissue dissolves.\nNote: Adult tissues contain more extracellular matrix than neonatal ones and take longer to digest. Do not exceed 1.5 h of total incubation time even if some tissue pieces remain.\nAdd 3 mL of trypsin inhibitor to digested epidermis and vigorously pipet the solution up and down with a 1 mL pipette tip to further dissociate single cells from epidermis (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).",
    "Split the digested epidermis into two 15 mL tubes and centrifuge at 250 g for 5 min at 19 °C–21°C.\nAspirate collagen/fibronectin and gelatin solutions from the coated vessels.\nRemove the supernatant from each 15 mL tubes and resuspend the pellets by flicking the tubes a couple of times.\nAdd 10 mL to T75, 5 mL to 6 cm plate or 2 mL to 6-well plate of warm M2 medium supplemented with double concentration of antibiotics to one of the tubes and appropriate volume of warmed CnT supplemented with double concentration of antibiotics and 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride to the second tube.\nNote: Y-27632 greatly improves yield of isolated keratinocytes, especially for the adult ones, it also extends their lifespan, however it can also have an impact on downstream applications.\nSeed resuspended melanocytes and keratinocytes into appropriate vessels and place in the incubator.\nOnce pieces of dermis are digested, add 9 mL HBSS to the tube to reduce viscosity and pass the cell suspension through 70 μm cell strainer into 50 mL tube.\nTransfer the cell suspension into 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 250 g for 5 min at 19 °C–21°C to pellet cells.\nPrepare six 5 mL FACS tubes, each containing 1 mL of warm ECMV medium.\nAdd between 2 and 5 μL of CD31 Dynabeads (depending on the tissue size) to the first tube, mix thoroughly, place in a magnet stand for 1 min to wash.\nNote: The beads settle very quickly so swirl and pipette immediately.\nAspirate media from washed beads when still on magnetic stand and add 1 mL of warm ECMV medium.\nRemove supernatant from centrifuged cells, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of warm ECMV medium and add cell suspension to the tube with beads.",
    "Securely replace cap, invert tube several times and place it on a roller at 7 rpm.\nIncubate for 30 min at 19 °C–21°C.\nPause point: There is a stopping point when cells are incubated with CD31 Dynabeads.\nBriefly spin down the tube to collect all cells at the bottom of the tube.\nRemove the cap and place the tube in magnet stand.\nAllow beads to collect on magnet, turn the tube 180 ° to release any trapped cells and leave it for 2 min.\nCollect the supernatant containing unbound cells into a fresh 15 mL tube while tube is sitting on a magnet and avoid disturbing the beads.\nTake the tube out of the magnet and resuspend the beads in 1 mL of warm ECMV medium.\nTransfer the cell supernatant into next tube and place it in the magnetic stand.\nRepeat steps 31–35 until final tube is done, combining unbound cells from step 33 into the same 15 mL tube.\nAspirate gelatin coating solution from one of the coated vessels.\nDepending on tissue size, resuspend purified CD31 positive microvascular endothelial cells in 2 mL (6-wells plate), 5 mL (6 cm plate) or 10 mL (T75 flask) of warm ECMV supplemented with double concentration of antibiotics and seed into appropriate gelatin-coated vessel.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL tube with unbound cells for 5 min at 250 g at 19 °C–21°C.\nPrepare six 5 mL FACS tubes, each with 1 mL of warm preadipocyte medium.\nAdd between 2 and 5 μL of CD34 Dynabeads (depending on the tissue size) to the first tube, mix thoroughly, place in a magnet stand for 1 min to wash.\nNote: The beads settle very quickly so swirl and pipette immediately.",
    "Aspirate media from washed beads when still on magnetic stand and add 1 mL of warm preadipocyte medium.\nRemove supernatant from centrifuged cells, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of warm preadipocyte medium and add cell suspension to the tube with beads.\nSecurely replace cap, invert tube several times and place it on a roller at 7 rpm.\nIncubate for 15 min at 19 °C–21°C.\nPause point: There is a stopping point when cells are incubated with CD31 Dynabeads.\nBriefly spin down the tube to collect all cells at the bottom of the tube.\nRemove the cap and place the tube in magnet stand.\nAllow beads to collect on magnet, turn the tube 180 ° to release any cells trapped accidentally on the magnet and let it sit for 2 min.\nNeonatal foreskin protocol.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant containing unbound cells while tube is sitting on a magnet avoiding disturbing beads.\nTake the tube out of the magnet and resuspend the beads in 1 mL of warm preadipocyte medium.\nTransfer the cell supernatant into next tube and place it in the magnetic stand.\nAdult tissue protocol.\nIf the tissue is too small to yield 3 pieces in step 4, collect the supernatant containing unbound cells into 15 mL tube.\nTake the tube out of the magnet and resuspend the beads in 1 mL of warm preadipocyte medium.\nTransfer the cell supernatant into next tube and place it in the magnetic stand.\nRepeat steps 47 and 48 until final tube is done, combining unbound cells from step 48b into the same 15 mL tube.\nAspirate gelatin coating solution from coated vessel.",
    "Depending on tissue size, resuspend purified CD34 positive preadipocytes in 2 mL (6-wells plate), 5 mL (6 cm plate) or 10 mL (T75 flask) of warm preadipocyte medium supplemented with double concentration of antibiotics and seed into appropriate gelatin-coated vessel.\nAdult tissue protocol.\nCentrifuge the tube with unbound cells from step 49 at 250 g for 5 min at 19 °C–21°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 2 mL (6-wells plate) or 5 mL (6 cm plate) of warm fibroblasts medium supplemented with double concentration of antibiotics and seed into appropriate gelatin-coated vessel.\nNote: Growing adult fibroblasts from CD31, CD34 negative population gives better yield than growing them from explants (point 13b), however these cells are not as pure and have other cell types present as well.\nCulturing and expanding of isolated cells\nTiming: 5–30 days\nThis part of the protocol guides the reader though culturing and expansion of the isolated cells.\nApproximately 24 h after cell isolation, change media of all cell types to the ones containing single concentration of antibiotics.\nCritical: Antibiotics are essential in culturing the isolated cells for the first week as they prevent growth of microbes present on the skin. However, adult keratinocytes are particularly sensitive to antibiotics, therefore if changing medium is not possible the next day, it should be done by the end of the day of isolation.\nNote: For the first couple of days after isolation, dermis pieces used for growing fibroblast should have only half of the normal volume of medium to prevent the pieces from detaching. It is fine if the pieces are not completely submerged in the medium, avoid aspirating dermis pieces during media changes.\nNote: If cells were seeded into 6-well plate or 6 cm dish, they should be expanded before freezing.",
    "Change medium every other day, use single concentration of antibiotics for 7 days, after that time, cells are grown without antibiotics.\nWhen the cells become confluent and need to be passed, coat appropriate vessels with appropriate coating solution for the cell type for at least 1 h at 37 °C.\nNote: We did not observe any adverse effects of fibroblasts and preadipocytes being allowed to reach confluency. Keratinocytes and microvascular endothelial cells are contact inhibited, but confluency initiates their differentiation, therefore these cells should not be kept confluent for more than a day. Melanocytes are very sensitive to confluency and should be passed when 80 % confluency is reached.\nWhen the vessels are coated, wash the cells once with HBSS.\nAll cell types except for melanocytes.\nAdd 0.5 mL (6-wells plate), 1 mL (6 cm plate) or 2 mL (T75 flask) of trypsin and incubate cells at 19 °C–21°C (fibroblasts, preadipocytes and microvascular endothelial cells) or 37 °C (keratinocytes) until cells start to round up.\nCritical: Keratinocytes require longer trypsinization than other cells to detach properly.\nNote: Quite often colonies of keratinocytes appear in adult fibroblasts cultures. The two cell types can be separated based on the different times required for trypsinization and both cell types can be used.\nNote: Microvascular endothelial cells can sometimes differentiate into another fibroblastic-looking cell type, we are unsure of the identity of these cells. When this happens, cells should be trypsinized and re-selected with CD31 Dynabeads (steps 24–38).\nAdd equal volume of trypsin inhibitor and transfer the cell suspension into 15 mL tube.\nWash the dish once with HBSS to collect any cells left behind and add it to the same 15 mL tube; cells can be counted at this point if necessary.\nMelanocytes.",
    "Add 5 mL of HBSS – and incubate the cells for 10–20 min at 37 °C.\nCritical: Melanocytes are extremely sensitive to trypsin and therefore should only be passed by the method described here.\nAfter melanocytes start to round up, forcefully knock the vessel to detach melanocytes from the vessel and transfer supernatant to a 15 mL tube.\nWash the dish once with HBSS to collect any cells left behind and add it to the same 15 mL tube; cells can be counted at this point if necessary.\nNote: Keratinocytes which were left attached can be trypsinized, expanded and cryopreserved.\nFor subsequent passing of melanocytes, they should be incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in HBSS and then scraped from the vessel using a cell scrapper.\nCentrifuge the tube at 250 g for 5 min at 19 °C–21°C and aspirate the supernatant.\nRemove coating solution from the vessels and seed the cells in appropriate medium.\nFreezing isolated cells\nTiming: 30 min\nThe final part of this protocol describes how to cryopreserve isolated cells.\nNote: We typically freeze cells from confluent T75 flask in 3 cryovials at concentrations 0.5–2 million cells per vial. When cells are ready for freezing follow steps 54–56.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of cold freezing mix per vial frozen (e.g., if freezing 3 vials, resuspend cells in 3 mL of freezing mix).\nNote: Freezing mix should be cold to minimize harmful effects of DMSO and rapid manipulation is encouraged.\nAliquot 1 mL of cell suspension per cryovial.\nPlace cryovials in freezing container and store it at −80 °C for 24 h.\nThe next day cells should be transferred to liquid nitrogen storage."
