    "**Cell lysis**\n_Erythrocytes_: \n1. Spin down freshly drawn blood at 500 g for 10 min\n  2. Discard plasma and buffy coat \n  3. Wash erythrocytes 3 x in PBS\n  4. Lyse erythrocytes with addition of 3x volume of ACK lysing buffer \\(leading to 4 x original volume), add 1x protease inhibitor \\(PI)\n  5. Nutate lysate at 4 °C for 10 min, spin down at 14,000 g for 10 min \\(pellet contains organelles and membranes and can be discarded), take aliquot \n  \n_3D5 cells_:\n1. Everything is done quickly on ice\n  2. Aspirate medium\n  3. Depending on confluence and size of dish , add 200-100 µl PBS \\(higher confluence, higher volume) + PI\n  4. Scrape plates\n  5. Wash 3 times with PBS + PI \\(meaning spinning cells down for 5 min at 3000 rpm, resuspend in 1 ml PBS + PI and repeat)\n  6. Last washing step: Take up in desired volume PBS + PI \\(to get desired concentration, higher amount of cells leaving to higher amount of PBS + PI)\n  7. Sonicate each sample 3 x 15 s, using micro tip sonicator \\(Fischer Sonic Dismembrator Model 300)  Lysate is placed on ice between each run\n  8. Samples are centrifuged 10 min at 14000g to pellet nuclei, cell debris and mitochondria\n  9. Supernatant is transferred to new cups, pellet is discarded\n  \n**Ammonium sulfate precipitation**:\n1. Add 25% \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> SLOWLY at 4 °C \\(calculation via http://www.encorbio.com/protocols/AM-SO4.htm)\n  2. stir lysate for 1 h at  4 °C\n  3. Spin down sample at 20,000 g for 20 min\n  4. Keep supernatant, take aliquot \n  5. Discard pellet, take aliquot \n  6. Bring up the supernatant rom 25% to 50% \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, by SLOWLY adding at 4 °C \\(calculation via http://www.encorbio.com/protocols/AM-SO4.htm) \n  7. Stir lysate for 1 h at  4 °C\n  8. Spin sample down at 20,000 g for 20 min",
    "9. Discard supernatant take aliquot\n  10. Only for erythrocyte lysate: Wash pellet 5-10x with 55% \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in dd water, \\(calculation via http://www.encorbio.com/protocols/AM-SO4.htm), until red color of sup is mostly gone. Washing means nutating the pellet in 55% \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for 10 min at 4 °C, then spinning it down at at 20,000 g for 20 min, keeping the pellet and discarding the supernatant. \n  11. Bring washed pellet up in respective chromatography binding buffer \\(see below) by nutating it  for 1 h at  4 °C\n  12. Spin sample own at 20,000 g for 20 min, discard pellet \n  13. Filter supernatant sequentially trough Whatman filter paper and 0.2 µM sterile filter. After filtering, take aliquot\n  \n**Bulk purification**\n_Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography \\(Äktapurifier and HiTrap Phenyl HP 5 ml)_\n1. Running buffer: 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 M \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Elution buffer: 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.0\n  2. Equilibrate HiTrap Phenyl HP 5 ml \\(GE Healthcare) with binding buffer\n  3. Inject erythrocyte lysate after \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> precipitation with 0.5 ml/min flow rate until UV absorption is stable. Collect flow through for analysis\n  4. Elution of protein: Pressure Limit 0,30 MPa, Flow Rate 1,5 ml/min, Fraction Size 1,5 ml, linear gradient 0% to 100% elution buffer for 15 CV. Collect all fractions, take aliquots for analysis \n  5. Wash column with MilliQ water  \\(to UV-Absorption = 0) to reactivate column\n  6. System, sample loop and column can be washed with 1 x dd water, 1 x 44% formic acid, 1 x dd water in case excess hemoglobin could not be removed\n  7. Analyze fractions via Western blotting for α-Synuclein and Hemoglobin\n  8. Pool α-Synuclein positive / Hemoglobin negative fractions and concentrate using centrifugal filters \n  \n_Anion Exchange Chromatography \\(Äktapurifier and HitrapQ HP 5ml)_:\n1. Equilibrate column with binding buffer  \\(20 mM Tris, 25 mM NaCl, pH 8.0)",
    "2. Let sample \\(erythrocyte lysate after \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> precipitation) run trough column at flow rate of 0.5 ml/min until UV absorption is stable, collect flow-trough\n  3. Elute sample at a flow rate of 1,5 ml/min, Fraction Size 1,5 ml, linear gradient for 10 CV from 0% to 100% elution buffer  \n  4. Wash column with 1 M NaOH  \\(to UV-Absorption = 0) to completely elute any remaining protein\n  5. Analyze fractions via Western blotting for α-Synuclein and Transthyretin\n  8. Pool α-Synuclein positive / Transthyretin negative fractions and concentrate using centrifugal filters \n  \n_Covalent Chromatography \\(Äktapurifier and Thiopropyl Sepharose 6B packed in a 150 ml XK 16/100 column)_:\n1. Equilibrate column with PBS\n  2. Load erythrocyte lysate after \\(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> precipitation on Sepharose 6B column, flow 0.2 ml/min, keep flow-trough \\(contains α-Synuclein)\n  3. Sample is concentrated using Centricon Plus 70 to approx. 10 ml \\(avoid concentrating it too much since it will cause aggregation). Take aliquot\n  4. Elute column with 5 column volumes of 25 mM DTT in PBS, flow rate 2.5 ml/min\n  5. Equilibrate column with borate buffer pH 8.0 + 1 mM EDTA, flow rate 2.5 ml/min\n  6. Mix 320 mg dipyridyl disuphide with 400 ml borate buffer, stir at 4 C for 4h  and filter \\(0.2 µm) \n  7. Eluted column with the borate/dipyridil sulfide mixture for 2 CV at 1 ml/min\n  8.
