    "The following protocol describes the standard procedure to isolate RNA from CSF and profile microRNAs using ready PCR plates. Note that the organic phase extraction is optional, and that a carrier RNA is added to the sample during extraction ensuring maximal recovery of RNA. Consequently, there is no need to quantify the RNA.\nOverall, an average of 6-8 plates can be run in one day if the cDNA is synthesized the day before (about 2 hr). Analysis of data is performed when all samples have been profiled and loaded into the software. Depending on the number of samples/groups or their combination for comparison, data analysis may require from one to several hours.\n1. RNA Extraction\nThe RNA extraction was performed from CSF samples, stored frozen at -80 °C in aliquots until analysis. For this procedure the mirVana Paris isolation kit was used, following the manufacturer's instructions for the total RNA isolation. Please note that, although enrichment for small RNA species is possible with this kit, this step is not done and the RNA extraction procedure is ended after the total RNA isolation step. In addition, although the mirVana Paris isolation kit (like other commercially available RNA isolation kits) does not require organic extraction, a protocol for this procedure can be found below.\n\tThe protocol for RNA extraction consists of two steps:\n\t1.1. Organic Extraction (not required if using mirVana Paris RNA extraction kit)\n\t1.2.2. Total RNA isolation\n1.1. Organic extraction\n1.1.1. Prepare reagents\nAdd 375 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol to 2x Denaturing solution, and store it at 4 °C.\n1.1.2. Prepare the CSF",
    "Thaw every aliquot of CSF on ice before the RNA extraction. Add 1 µg of MS2 RNA carrier to 0.5 ml of thawed CSF and gently mix. Note that if the organic extraction is omitted, the MS2 carrier will be added to the sample prior RNA isolation described in 1.2.2.1 below.\nMix 0.5 ml of 2x Denaturing Solution at room temperature to the CSF.\nAdd 1 ml of acid-phenol:chloroform to the CSF plus the 2x Denaturing Solution: be sure to withdrawn the bottom phase containing acid-phenol:chloroform, not the aqueous buffer that lies on top of the mixture. Additionally, note that acid-phenol:chloroform contains phenol, which is a poison and an irritant, use gloves and other personal protection equipment when working with this reagent.\nVortex for 30-60 sec to mix. For convenience, the 2 ml of sample/denaturing solution/acid-phenol:chloroform mix are divided into two 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at maximum speed (10,000 x g) at room temperature.\nCarefully remove the aqueous (upper) phase without disturbing the lower phase or the interphase and transfer it to a fresh tube. Note the volume recovered.\n1.2. RNA isolation\nIt is recommended to have a dedicated bench, set of pipettes, and racks for handling RNA samples. The working area and tools are decontaminated by using RNase Zap spray and wipes prior each experiment.\n1.2.1. Prepare reagents:\nAdd 21 ml of 100% ethanol to miRNA Wash Solution 1 and 40 ml of 100 % ethanol to Wash Solution 2/3. Please note that miRNA Wash Solution 1 contains guanidium thiocyanate that is a potentially hazardous substance.\n1.2.2. Total RNA isolation\nAdd 1.25 volumes of room temperature 100% ethanol to the aqueous phase from the organic extraction and mix thoroughly.\nPlace a Filter Cartridge into one of the Collection Tubes.",
    "Pipette not more than 700 μl of the lysate/ethanol mixture onto the Filter Cartridge.\nCentrifuge for 30 sec at maximum speed. Apply the mixture exceeding 700 μl in successive applications to the same filter. Discard the flow-through after every centrifugation and save the Collection Tube for the washing steps.\nApply 700 μl miRNA Wash Solution 1 to the Filter Cartridge and centrifuge for 15 sec at maximum speed. Discard the flow through from the Collection Tube and replace the Filter Cartridge into the same Collection Tube.\nApply 500 μl Wash Solution 2/3 and centrifuge for 15 sec at maximum speed. Discard the flow through from the Collection Tube and replace the Filter Cartridge into the same Collection Tube. Apply a second 500 μl Wash Solution 2/3 and centrifuge for 15 sec at maximum speed. Discard the flow through from the Collection Tube and replace the Filter Cartridge into the same Collection Tube. Spin the assembly for 1 min at maximum speed to remove residual fluid from the filter.\nTransfer the Filter Cartridge into a fresh Collection Tube. Apply 100 μl of preheated (to 95 °C) nuclease-free water to the center of the filter, and close the cap. Centrifuge for 30 sec at maximum speed to recover the RNA.\nCollect the eluate containing RNA and store it at -80 °C for subsequent applications.\nQuantify 1 µl of RNA using the NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer. Note that RNA quantification can be skipped if an RNA carrier is added to the sample during RNA extraction. In that case 8 µl of RNA are subjected to cDNA synthesis as detailed below.\n2. miRNA Profile: qRT-PCR Protocol\nThe protocol for miRNA profiling consists of two steps:\nFirst-strand cDNA synthesis\nReal-time PCR amplification\n2.1. First-strand cDNA synthesis\n2.1.1. Dilute template RNA",
    "Adjust each of the template RNA samples to a concentration of 5 ng/µl using nuclease free water. If the RNA has not been quantified (see step 1.2.2.9), then 8 µl of RNA are utilized for cDNA synthesis\n2.1.2. Prepare reagents\nGently thaw the 5x Reaction buffer and nuclease free water, and immediately place on ice.\nMix by vortexing. Resuspend the RNA spike-in by adding 40 µl nuclease free water to the tube and mix by vortexing; leave it on ice for 15-20 min. Immediately before use, remove the enzyme mix from the freezer, mix by flicking the tubes and place on ice. Spin down all reagents.\n2.1.3. Reverse transcription reaction setup\nPrepare the required amount of RT working solution in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, or equivalent (in the proportions indicated in Table 1, except for the RNA template), mix by vortexing (1-2 sec at max speed), briefly spin down (we use a mini Eppendorf centrifuge with fixed speed, 10 sec) and place it on ice. Note that the UniSp6 RNA spike-in is added to the sample prior the RT reaction (see Table 1).\nDispense RT working solution into nuclease free PCR tubes.\nDispense template RNA in each tube.\n\t\tNote: remember to calculate 10% excess volume/each reagent for pipetting and/or robotic dead volume.\n\t\ttable:\n﻿0,1,2\nReagent,Panel I Volume (µl),Panel I + II Volume (µl)\n5x reaction buffer,4.4,8.8\nNuclease free water,9.9,19.8\nEnzyme mix,2.2,4.4\nUniSp6 RNA Spike-in template,1.1,2.2\nTemplate total RNA (5 ng/µl),4.4,8.8\nTotal Volume,22,44\nTable 1. Reverse transcription reaction setup.\n2.1.4. Mix and spin reagents\nMix the reaction by gentle (1-2 sec) vortexing to ensure that all reagents are thoroughly mixed. After mixing, spin down (mini Eppendorf centrifuge with fixed speed, 10 sec).\n2.1.5. Incubate and heat inactivate\nProgram a PCR machine as follow:\nIncubate for 60 min at 42 °C",
    "Heat-inactivate the reverse transcriptase for 5 min at 95 °C\nImmediately cool to 4 °C\nStore at 4 °C or freeze\n\t\tNote: the protocol can be interrupted at this stage. The undiluted cDNA may be kept at -20 °C for up to 5 weeks (optional store at 4 °C for up to 4 days).\n2.2. Real-time PCR amplification\n2.2.1. Prepare reagents for Real-time PCR\nPlace cDNA (from step 2.1.5) on ice.\nThaw nuclease free water and PCR Master mix on ice. Protect the PCR Master mix vials from light by covering them with aluminum foil. Immediately before use, mix the PCR Master mix by vortexing 1-2 sec in a mini centrifuge and spin down at 1,500 x g for 1 min.\n2.2.2. Combine SYBR Green master mix, water, and cDNA and add to PCR plates\nThe following procedure is recommended to avoid low concentrations of cDNA from adhering to tube surface:\nBefore removing the plate seal, briefly spin down the plate(s) in a refrigerated centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 1 min.\nIn a 15 ml conical tube, combine 2x PCR Master mix and water. Panel I: 2,000 µl 2x master mix and 1,980 µl water; Panel I+II: 4,000 µl 2x master mix and 3,960 µl water.\nAdd 20 µl cDNA (panel I) or 40 µl cDNA (panel I+II) and mix.\nMix gently by vortexing 1-2 sec and spin down in a refrigerated centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 1 min.\nPlace the PCR Master mix/cDNA mix in a multichannel pipette reservoir. You may have to identify a reservoir that has the length of the multichannel pipette. This keeps the level of volume high enough allowing for equal volume aliquots throughout the multichannel. This is critical towards the last few aliquots.",
    "Dispense 10 µl PCR Master mix/cDNA mix to each well of the 384-well plate using a 16-channel pipette.\nSeal the plate with optical sealing.\nSpin plate briefly in a refrigerated centrifuge (1,500 x g for 1 min), to mix the solutions and remove air bubbles.\n\t\tNote: the experiment can be paused at this point. Store the reactions protected from light at 4 °C for up to 24 hr.\n2.2.3. Real-Time PCR\nPerform real-time PCR amplification and melting curve analysis following the parameters detailed in Table 2.\ntable:\n﻿0,1\nProcess Step,\"Settings, Roche LC480\"\nPolymerase Activation/Denaturation,\"95 °C, 10 min\"\nAmplification,\"45 Amplification cycles at  95 °C, 10 sec  60 °C, 1 min  Ramp-rate  1.6 °C/sec  Optical read\"\nMelting curve analysis,Yes\nTable 2. Real-time PCR cycle conditions using the Roche LightCycler 480.\n2.3. Real-time PCR data analysis\nReal time PCR data analysis is done with the Exiqon GenEx Professional 5.0, following the recommended instructions. The GenEx step-by-step manual can be downloaded at http://www.exiqon.com/ls/Documents/Scientific/Exiqon-data-analysis-guide.pdf[href=http://www.exiqon.com/ls/Documents/Scientific/Exiqon-data-analysis-guide.pdf]\n\tData analysis consists of three steps:\nImport of data\nPreprocessing of data\nStatistical analysis\n2.3.1. Import of data\nIn the Roche LightCycler 480 select the 2nd derivative analysis method and calculate the Cq values. Data are exported as a table and saved as text files.\nTo import the data, open GenEx and click on the Exiqon import wizard button and click \"Start\". Follow the instructions to select format, instrument and plate layout file(s). Note that plate layout files (excel files) are downloaded from the Exiqon web site (http://www.exiqon.com/plate-layout-files[href=http://www.exiqon.com/plate-layout-files]).\nImport Panels I and II and click \"Next\".\nThe table generated after file import contains predefined columns. Samples names can be edited and classification columns can be added or removed at this step. Click \"Next\" when you are done.\nSave data and load to Data Editor.\n2.3.2. Preprocessing of data",
    "As recommended by Exiqon and GenEx, when comparing multiple plates the first thing to do is to calibrate the data between the plates by choosing inter-plate calibration from the preprocessing menu.\nIt is recommended to run miRNA arrays in triplicate runs. If a miRNA is not present in at least two out of three replicas it will be set as nonexpressed.\nIn the next step in the preprocessing, set a cut off. Defining a cut off value indicates that data with a threshold cycle (Ct) higher than this value are discarded. In the present experiments using cerebrospinal fluid specimen, the cut off was set at 39. Therefore, all samples with a Ct higher than 39 in the three replicas will be discarded. If a miRNA has a Ct > 39 for one probe (one replica out of three), that reading will be replaced with the average of the Ct for the other two probes, provided they are both below 39.\nDefine reference genes. GenEx Professional has the option to utilize geNorm and/or NormFinder to identify reference genes. Select a list of miRNAs that have similar Cq values across all sample and run geNorm and/or NormFinder. According to this analysis, in the example provided here, miR-622 and miR-1266 had the most uniform values across the samples and were chosen as reference genes (Figure 1).\nNext, data are normalized using the reference genes and the values obtained correspond to the ΔCt\nIf cDNA synthesis reactions were performed in triplicates, at this point the values should be averaged.",
    "Validate sheet to remove empty and almost empty columns. In the preprocessing window select \"Validate sheet\" and than apply on the Remove empty columns line. In the line below, chose the desired percentage of valid data and click apply. For instance, select 100% if you wish to compare only miRNAs common to all samples.\nHandle missing data.\n\t\tSelect “Missing data” from the Preprocessing menu and chose one of the options to handle missing data. This step is required. Note that GenEx will give you error if you try to load files that contain unhandled missing data.\nDetermine relative quantification between groups of samples (i.e. experiment versus control). Relative quantification among groups is calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. In GenEx, click the preprocessing tab and select relative quantification. In the window select the reference group and hit apply. Note that for graphical representations and/or for further statistical analyses, expression data should be converted to a logarithmic scale. In the preprocessing menu, select Log2.\n2.3.3. Statistical Analysis\nGenEx software allows a wide range of statistical analyses, including T-test and ANOVA.\nLoad the final mdf file into GenEx and open data manager. It is critical to select the correct samples or groups of samples for which statistical analysis is performed.\nSelect \"Statistics\" and chose the icon corresponding to the desired test.\nClick \"Run\" in the control panel window. Save results as excel or mdf files.\n2.3.4. Expression profiling\nMicroRNAs and samples can be classified, clustered, and visualized on heat-maps and dendrograms, as follows\nLoad the final mdf file into GenEx and open data manager. Use this window to select and create groups of samples or miRNAs. Click \"Apply\" when you are done.\nIn the upper left corner select cluster and click on the heatmap icon",
    "In the control panel window click \"Run\". The heatmap can be saved in various formats such as tiff or bmp; it can also be copied and modified as needed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
