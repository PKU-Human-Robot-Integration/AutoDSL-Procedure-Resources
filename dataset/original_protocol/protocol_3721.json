As we described in the section of “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”, the target DNA sequence can be fully chemically synthesized or come from genomic DNA. For the former, during chemical synthesis sequence of the flanking deoxyribozymes and homology arms can be directly added to the ends of the target dsDNA (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), thus the following steps (b(i-III)) are not needed. For the latter, please refer to steps (b(i-III)) for the construction of dsDNA that can be inserted into a phagemid vector.\nBasically, we use the chemically synthesized primers to PCR amplify the target DNA in a step-by-step way for DNA reconstruction. Take the pseudogene fragment that encodes an ssDNA triangle (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], Jia et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) as an example,\nFirst, employ primer1 fwd & rev as the initial pair of primers to amplify the pseudogene template as following:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_647_13.csv\nThermo-cycling condition of first round PCR\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_647_14.csv\nUse agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA recovery kit to purify the first round of PCR products.\nSecond, treat the purified products as templates, and use primer2 fwd & rev as the second pair of primers for the second round of PCR amplification. Use agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA recovery kit to purify the second round of PCR products.",
    "Third, similarly use primer3 fwd & rev as the third pair of primers for the third round of PCR amplification. After this operation, sequence of the deoxyribozyme and homology arm has been added to the ends of the target dsDNA. Use agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA recovery kit to purify the products. Use Nanodrop to quantify the concentration of collected dsDNA. Store the sample at 4°C or −20°C.\nPrepare the linearized vector of p3024 phagemid (3024 bp, a pBluescript variant). In the multiple cloning site, set up the primer binding regions for PCR amplification to generate the full-length linear phagemid, using the circular p3024 phagemid as the template. A pair of primers (p3024 fwd & rev) has been shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] as an example. PCR protocols are similar to that used in step b.i., except that the time used for extension is increased from 30 sec to 3 min in each PCR cycle. Purify the linearized phagemid vector by agarose gel electrophoresis and recover the products with the DNA Recovery Kit.\nAlternatives: Digest the circular p3024 phagemid with restriction enzymes, and isolate the linearized products by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nClone the recombinant p3024 phagemid\nInsert the target dsDNA fragment into the p3024 phagemid backbone by homologous recombination. Prepare two clean Eppendorf tubes, one for the experimental group and the other as a negative control. Refer to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] to add the components for the recombination reaction. Use a pipette to gently mix the reactant (Do not shake), and briefly centrifuge the tubes to let the samples set at the bottom. Details about the ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit can be further found on its standard protocol.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_647_15.csv\nIncubate the samples at 37°C for 30 min. Then chill the tubes on ice immediately for 10 min.",
    "Meantime, thaw two tubes of JM109 competent cells (100 μL in each) on ice. Pipette 10 μL of the recombinant products and mix it with the competent cells in one tube. Tap the tube gently for a thorough mixing and leave the tube on ice for 30 min. Do the same to the negative control sample.\nHeat-shock the samples at 42°C for 45 sec. Then immediately chill them on ice for 2–3 min. After that, add 900 μL of the LB medium to the samples, and shake the samples with a speed of 220 rpm at 37°C for 1 h.\nTake the samples off the shaker. Centrifuge the tubes at a speed of 5,000 rcf for 5 min. Pipette 900 μL of the supernatant and discard. Resuspend cell pellet at the bottom of the tubes in the left-over medium by vigorous tapping.\nWarm two LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL) at 37°C for 30 min. Plate 100 μL of each transformation (including the negative control) on the plates. Continue to incubate the plates at 37°C for 12 h. Multiple colonies should be viewable for the experimental group, and close-to-zero colonies should be identified in the negative control (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/647-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Add 2 mL LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL) into each tube. In our experiments, we used 10 tubes to examine the insertions in 10 colonies.",
    "Prepare the same number of 200-μL Eppendorf tubes. To each tube, add 30 μL of the PCR reaction solution prepared as above (see step 1.b.i.) including all components but the template. The pair of primers (primer4 fwd & rev, Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) is designed to complement with the regions on the p3024 vector nearby the insertion. Suggested concentrations of the primers in the reaction buffer are around 0.5–1 μM.\nUse the 200-μL pipette tip to pick a single colony from the agar plate. Dip the tip firstly into the LB medium for inoculation, then into the PCR solution for providing templates for amplification. Repeat the operation until all 10 colonies are picked.\nNote: a) Keep the tip dipping in the medium for 5–10 sec to ensure inoculation; b) For individual colonies, remember to label the 5-mL tube and 200-μL tube correctly, and make sure their one-to-one correspondence.\nCultivate the colonies in the medium at 37°C for 8 h, agitating at a speed of 220 rpm.\nMeanwhile, run standard PCR amplification (25–30 cycles) on a thermocycler. Then exploit agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis to check which colonies contain the right length of the insertion of the target DNA. An example gel is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/647-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Screening for colonies with the correct length of the insertion by agarose gel electrophoresis\nAccording to the electrophoresis data (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), discard the culture inoculated with colonies (1 & 9) carrying wrong insertions, and collect the cultures inoculated with the colonies with correct insertion (2–8, & 10).\nFrom the culture, extract the recombinant p3024 phagemid dsDNA using the Plasmid mini kit I. Pick three out of eight phagemid samples and send them for sequencing.",
    "Note: Normally the sequencing data show that, at least one among three samples contains the insertion of target DNA without a mutation. If all three samples contain mutations, check the other samples by sequencing.\nWhile waiting for the sequencing data, keep the DNA samples at −20°C for later use.\nNote: The sequencing process takes about 2 days.\nAmplification of phagemid and extraction of ssDNA from phagemid particles\nTiming: 3 days\nDay 5:\nTransformation with the recombinant p3024 phagemid carrying the correct insertion\nThaw JM109 competent cells (100 μL in a tube) on ice.

Tap the tube gently for a thorough mixing and leave the tube on ice for 30 min.\nHeat-shock the sample at 42°C for 45 sec. Then immediately chill it on ice for 2–3 min. After that, add 900 μL of the LB medium to the sample, and shake the sample with a speed of 220 rpm at 37°C for 1 h.\nTake the sample off the shaker. Centrifuge the tube at a speed of 5,000 rcf for 5 min. Pipette 900 μL of the supernatant and discard.

Continue to incubate the plate at 37°C for 12 h or longer, until colonies come out.\nDay 6:\nPrepare a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube with 20 mL LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL).",
    "With a 200-μL pipette tip, inoculate a single bacterial colony from the agar plate in step 4.d into the 20 mL LB medium.\nIncubate the medium culture at 37°C and shake it at a speed of 220 rpm for about 10–12 h.\nMeantime, seal the agar plate with parafilm and keep it at 4°C.\nNote: This is to store the colonies in case more phagemid needs to be amplified later. With the sealing, the colonies can be still effective after 6 months.\nDay 7:\nAmplification of the recombinant phagemid\nPrepare two 1-L sterile flasks with 300 mL 2× YT medium (5 mM MgCl2) in each.\nFor each flask, inoculate with 3 mL of the JM109 cell culture from step 4.g.\nShake the flasks with a speed of 200–220 rpm at 37°C until the OD600 of the culture reaches about 0.4–0.5.\nNote: This usually takes about 2–3 h. After 1.5 h, the OD600 value of cell culture should be measured every 15–30 min. Time point by the culture reaches OD 0.4–0.5 can be estimated by fitting the plot of the measured OD values by an exponential function. These steps can be necessary as the culture can rapidly reach and surpass the desired OD values.\nThaw the vcsM13 helper phage (prepared in the step 4.k of “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]”, 100 μL, 5 × 1012 pfu/mL)) at 23°C.\nAt an OD600 value of 0.4–0.5, add 100 μL vcsM13 helper phage into each flask. Continue to shake the flasks with a speed of 200–220 rpm at 37°C for 30 min.\nAdd 210 μL kanamycin (100 mg/mL) into each flask to select for cells that have been infected by the helper phage. Continue to shake the flasks with a speed of 200–220 rpm at 37°C for 3.5 h.",
    "Harvesting the phagemid particles In the presence of the vcsM13 helper phage, the recombinant p3024 phagemid is amplified in the single-stranded form and packed into phagemid particles, the majority of which are secreted into the medium.\nPrepare two clean 1-L centrifuge bottles.\nTransfer the medium culture in step 5.f to the two bottles. Balance, and then centrifuge at 4,000 rcf for 15 min at 4°C.\nPrepare a clean 1-L glass beaker.\nCollect the supernatant (where the phagemid particles are) from step 6.b by pouring it into the beaker. Discard the pellet containing bacteria.\nNote: The shape, color, and cleanness of the pellet can be used to judge the quality of the phage amplification process. An example with normal bacterial pellet after centrifugation is shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].

After discarding the supernatant, an example of the pellet of phagemid particles is shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/647-Fig8.jpg",
    "Figure 8. An example showing the pellet of phagemid particles\nThe pellet is highlighted with magenta dashed-lines.\nResuspend the pellet in TE buffer. Usually for the pellet generated from every 300 mL culture, we use 4 mL TE buffer.\nNote: a) Using the 1-mL pipette to repeatedly blow the buffer onto the pellet can facilitate its dissolving. b) More buffer solution can be used to dissolve the pellet of larger size.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 16,000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C to remove undissolved substances.\nPrepare two sterile 50-mL centrifuge tubes.\nPipette the supernatant in step 6.j carefully and transfer into the 50-mL tubes for storage at 4°C.\nDay 8:\nStripping proteins off the p3024 recombinant phagemid particles\nFor every 4 mL TE buffer (containing recombinant phagemid particles) in a 50-mL centrifuge tube, add 8 mL PPB2 solution and gently shake the mixture by hands at 23°C for 3 min.\nFor each tube, add 6 mL PPB3 solution to the mixture.

    "Note: Do not suck the sediment into the supernatant. Otherwise the purity of the phagemid ssDNA products would be affected. In case the supernatant is contaminated with the sediment after transferring, repeat steps 7.d–f.\nRecovering the p3024 recombinant phagemid ssDNA\nFor each tube from step 7.f (18 mL solution), add 18 mL 100% ethanol (v/v: 1/1).\nScrew up the cap, and vortex the tubes vigorously for thorough mixing.\nIncubate the tubes in an ice-water bath for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 16,000 rcf for 30 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.

In other words, the yield of phagemid ssDNA is commonly around 1–10 pmol per 1 mL cell culture.",
    "Isolation of target ssDNA from the recombinant phagemid ssDNA by deoxyribozyme-guided site-specific hydrolysis\nTiming: 2 days\nDay 9:\nCleavage of recombinant p3024 phagemid ssDNA by deoxyribozymes to release the target ssDNA\nConvert the concentration (C) of phagemid ssDNA from ng/μL to nM. This is calculated with the following equation: CnM = 106 × Cng/μL ÷ Molecular weight of phagemid ssDNA, wherein the Molecular weight of phagemid ssDNA roughly equals to (330 × the number of bases) g/mol.\nResuspend the pre-ordered DNA enzyme strands (E1&2 in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) in ddH2O to a concentration of 100 μM each.\nNote: To cleave ssDNA at a specific site, the deoxyribozymes can be designed to attack either in cis or in trans (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In this protocol, we choose the trans-attacking as an example, in which short, synthetic DNA enzyme strands must be added to hybridize to the deoxyribozyme substrate sites for DNA cleavage (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). If the cis-attacking mode was chosen, then the entire deoxyribozyme sequence would be programmed in the recombinant phagemid ssDNA, and no extra DNA enzyme strands would be needed (Praetorius et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). The pros and cons of the cis- and trans-attacking can be found in Praetorius et al. (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] and Jia et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/647-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. An example showing the trans-attacking by synthetic DNA enzyme strands\nThe target ssDNA (magenta) produced here is programmed to be able to self-fold into a triangular shape.",
    "Use a molar ratio of 3:1 for enzyme vs substrate to construct the reaction system. The enzyme refers to the DNA enzyme strand (E1&2 in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]), while the substrate refers to the recombinant p3024 phagemid ssDNA (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]). For example, the 4 mL phagemid ssDNA solution from step 8.k was measured with a concentration of ~700 nM. That means totally we have 2.8 nmol phagemid ssDNA. It requires 8.4 nmol E1 and 8.4 nmol E2, or 84 μL of each synthetic DNA enzyme strands (100 μM), for digestion at the specific sites.\nPrepare a 100 mL glass beaker.\nPour 4 mL phagemid ssDNA solution into the beaker. Add 84 μL of E1 and 84 μL of E2 to the beaker. Adjust the total volume of the sample to 28 mL with the Deoxyribozyme reaction buffer 1, which corresponds to a concentration of phagemid ssDNA of 100 nM. A recipe for digestion of phagemid ssDNA with deoxyribozymes\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_647_16.csv\nCritical: The deoxyribozymes we used here are Zn2+ dependent and have a sharp Zn2+ range (Gu et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). This metal ion is included in the Deoxyribozyme reaction buffer 2. High concentration of DNA is known to reduce the free Zn2+ concentration in the solution due to the non-specific binding of Zn2+ to DNA backbone. In our case, this will lead to the inefficiency of deoxyribozyme-guided hydrolysis of DNA. To avoid this issue, it is necessary to control the concentration of phagemid ssDNA in the deoxyribozyme-digestion system. Based on our experience, it is better to keep the concentration of phagemid ssDNA in the Deoxyribozyme reaction buffer 1 no more than 100 nM.\nPlace the beaker on a heater, and heat sample near to boiling (with a couple of bubbles generated from the bottom of the solution).",
    "Take the beaker off the heater. Cover the beaker with Saran wrap and leave it at 23°C for cooling down. It usually takes about 1 h.\nNote: The steps 9.f–g are annealing steps to allow the deoxyribozyme enzyme strands (E1&2) to hybridize to the corresponding substrate locations on the recombinant p3024 phagemid ssDNA, getting ready for the DNA-catalyzed DNA hydrolysis.\nAdd an equal volume (28 mL) of the Deoxyribozyme reaction buffer 2 to the beaker. Place the sample in a thermostatic chamber with the temperature setting at 37°C for ~12-h incubation.\nNote: The target ssDNA fragment is released from the recombinant p3024 phagemid ssDNA by the DNA-catalyzed DNA hydrolysis in this step.\nDay 10:\nPurification of the target ssDNA\nPrepare a 250-mL centrifuge tube.\nPour the sample from step 9.h into the tube. Add 3 volumes (168 mL) of 100% ethanol, and vortex to mix the solution thoroughly.\nBury the tube in dry ice for 30 min.\nBalance the rotor and centrifuge the tube at 16,000 rcf for 30 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nWash the white precipitate with 50 mL 75% ethanol (pre-cooled at 4°C).\nBalance the rotor and centrifuge the tube again at 16,000 rcf at 4°C for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nPlace the 250-mL centrifuge tube upside down to remove the supernatant residue and allow the ssDNA pellet air-dried. This takes about 1 h.\nWith 8 mL ddH2O, rinse the inner wall of the tube where the DNA pellet is. Use 1 mL pipette to repeatedly blow water onto the wall to completely dissolve the DNA.\nTransfer 8 mL DNA solution into a 50-mL Eppendorf tube.\nPrepare 1% denaturing agarose gels. See the “prepare reagents and buffers[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]” section for the detailed recipe.",
    "Alternatives: a) A general 1% agarose gel without the denaturing content (urea) also works for the purification. However, its resolution will not be as good as that of the 1% denaturing agarose gel, because the hybridization between the deoxyribozyme enzyme and substrate strands will lead to smearing of the cleaved ssDNA fragments under non-denaturing conditions. b) For milligram level of DNA, anion exchange chromatography can be used to separate the cleaved target ssDNA from the phagemid ssDNA vector.\nAdd 8 mL 2× denaturing loading buffer to the DNA sample in step 10.k. Shake the sample by hands for thorough mixing.\nLoad the sample on denaturing agarose gels. Run the gels at 6 volts/cm at 4°C for ~2 h.\nNote: a) Normally on a 12 cm × 8 cm × 0.8 cm (length × width × height) agarose gel, about 1 mL of the DNA sample in step 10.m can be loaded. Therefore to purify all 16 mL of the sample, multiple gels are required. Based on our experience, loading less than 200 pmol of the recombinant p3024 phagemid ssDNA on one agarose gel can guarantee the separation quality. Over-loading of DNA will decrease the resolution of electrophoresis. b) Agarose gels of a large size can be used to minimize the working load. c) Running the gels at low temperatures is suggested. High temperatures tend to cause melting of urea-containing gels.\nScan the gels using the Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR+ (Bio-Rad). An example gel image is shown in Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] for the potential problem.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/647-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. A typical gel image for deoxyribozyme-assisted digestion of phagemid ssDNA",
    "Critical: There should be 4–5 visible bands on the gel. The vcsM13 helper phage ssDNA (~8,600 nt) usually displays on the top. Depending on the size of the target ssDNA, it can be shown above or below the recombinant p3024 phagemid ssDNA. In our experiment, the target ssDNA is ~600 nt. Therefore its corresponding band is below the recombinant p3024 (3,600 nt) and the cleaved p3024 fragment (~3,000 nt). Because the lengths of the recombinant p3024 and the cleaved p3024 fragment are too close, they are not separated very well on the gel and presented as one broad band. The deoxyribozyme enzyme strands usually run to the bottom of the gel. Loading a DNA ladder into the gel can help to judge which band is supposed to be the target ssDNA.\nUsing razor or scalpel, excise gel containing a target DNA fragment under UV irradiation, and recover the ssDNA with the DNA recovery kit (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nAlternatives: Place the gel band into a dialysis pocket (SpectraPor biotech dialysis membrane, MWCO: 8–10 kD) with 1× TAE buffer. Seal the pocket and place it in an agarose gel-running chamber filled with 1× TAE buffer. Slowly run DNA out of the gel into the buffer in the pocket for ~1 h. Open the dialysis pocket and pipette the TAE buffer out. Precipitate DNA with ethanol to collect the purified target ssDNA products.",
    "Note: The deoxyribozyme-assisted excision of the target ssDNA off the recombinant phagemid is based on complementation of the DNA enzyme strands to the substrate regions on phagemid DNA. This complementation still exists after DNA cleavage, thus could result in the contamination of the target ssDNA with DNA enzyme strands if denaturation is incomplete. A second-time gel purification of the collected target ssDNA helps to further remove the potential contaminants of DNA enzyme strands, if high-quality of target ssDNA is critical to the downstream applications.\nUse Nanodrop to measure the concentration of the target ssDNA. Store the sample at −20°C for later use.\nNote: a) Usually we obtain yields of 10% to 20% after deoxyribozyme digestion and target-DNA purification. For the 2.8 nmol recombinant p3024 phagemid ssDNA extracted from 600 mL cell culture, eventually we collected 587 pmol (~0.1 mg) of the target ssDNA (~600 nt in length), which corresponds to an ~21% yield. b) To produce more quantities of target ssDNA, one can simply start with more shake flasks of cell culture, or transfer to fermenter for more efficient culturing and amplification of the recombinant phagemid. c) The cost of ssDNA production with this approach has been estimated to be ~$100 per 1 mg ssDNA with shake flask, and ~$200 per 1 g ssDNA with fermenter (Jia et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nQuality check of the target ssDNA\nTiming: 1 day",
    "The target ssDNA we prepared was designed to be able to self-fold into a triangular shape. Therefore its quality can be readily checked by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We conducted the characterization with a Multimode VIII microscope with ScanAsyst-Fluid + tips in the ScanAsyst mode in fluid. Users can design the sequence of target ssDNA for other purposes, including ssDNA-mediated targeted gene knockin and so on, with other characterization methods to check its quality. For example, one can use the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to evaluate the error/mutation rates of the produced ssDNA target, or use the chromatography-based separation method to check the purity of the produced ssDNA target. In this protocol, we focus on AFM characterization of the shapes formed by the target ssDNA in the following steps.\nDay 11:\nCharacterization of the ssDNA triangle by AFM\nPrepare a 0.6 mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd each component into the tube according to the table below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_647_17.csv\nUse a PCR thermal cycler to perform fast annealing of the sample: 90°C for 3 min, 75°C for 5 min, 60°C for 5 min, 45°C for 5 min, and 22°C for 5 min. Store the sample at 4°C.\nDo a 10× dilution with the 1× TAE buffer (12.5 mM MgCl2) to adjust sample’s concentration to 5 nM.\nDeposit 5 μL of the 5 nM sample onto the freshly cleaved mica surface and leave to adsorb for 5 min.\nAdd 25 μL of the 1× TAE buffer (12.5 mM MgCl2) and 5 μL of 100 mM NiCl2 onto the mica.\nScan the sample with a peak force set point of 0.01 N, peak force amplitude of 50 nm, and peak force frequency of 2 kHz.
