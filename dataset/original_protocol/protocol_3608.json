    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCulture of THP-1 Cells\nTiming: 1–3 weeks\nIn this protocol, THP-1 cells (Tsuchiya et al., 1980[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) are cultured until there are sufficient cells to perform the screen. Each full 384 well plate will require about 21 million cells. THP-1 cells are a suspension cell line and should not adhere to cell culture flasks when growing normally. Flasks should be kept static during cell growth, not shaken or otherwise agitated. Aseptic technique should be used to ensure the cells remain free of microbial contamination.\nCulture THP-1 cells in suspension in T75 or T150 flasks and move to T225 flasks when 50 mL or greater of cell culture is achieved. Cells should be maintained between 300,000 and 800,000 cells per mL in THP-1 culture media. Adjust the frequency of passaging to ensure cells remain under 800,000 cells per mL, do not exhaust their media too quickly (as indicated by the media becoming acidified and the phenol red indicator turning yellow), and double about every three days. It is not necessary to use low attachment cell culture flasks.\nPassage cells by diluting with media when cells approach 800,000 cells per mL.\nMix cells well and take a sample to determine cell density. Dilute a sample of cell suspension in a 1:1 ratio with 0.4% Trypan Blue solution. Load 10 μl of cell suspension with Trypan Blue to a hemocytometer or automated cell counter slide and count cells.\nDilute cells with fresh media to 300,000 cells per mL.\nPassage cells with a complete media exchange approximately 3–4 days later (adjust timing of passaging to ensure proper cell density and prevent media exhaustion).\nMix cells well and take a sample to count cells using 0.4% Trypan Blue and a hemocytometer or automated cell counter as described above.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend in fresh media at 300,000 cells per mL.\nCritical: Do not allow cell concentration to exceed 1 million cells per mL under normal culture conditions.\nTitrate IFN-γ Activity\nTiming: 3–4 days\nIFN-γ should be titrated to determine the activity of a given lot of IFN-γ and THP-1 cells, and to determine the effective concentration at which 20% (EC20) and 50% (EC50) maximal PD-L1 expression is achieved. We recommend performing a dose response curve with at least 12 concentrations of IFN-γ and at least 10 replicate wells for each concentration. This can be adapted for other stimuli applied to cells.\nCentrifuge THP-1 cells at 300 × g for 5 min. Resuspend cells in fresh media at 1.25 million viable cells per mL.\nDistribute 40 μl of cell suspension per well to a 384 well plate using a reagent dispenser (e.g., the BioTek MicroFlo) or multichannel pipette.\nPrepare dilution of IFN-γ.\nIFN-γ is prepared at 5X of its desired final concentration.\nA serial dilution should be performed. Start with IFN-γ diluted in THP-1 media at 10 μg/mL. Dilute by a factor of 2 to generate at least 12 concentrations (the final dilution should be about 4.9 ng/mL IFN-γ). Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] shows directions for performing an example serial dilution.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_533_3.csv\nTransfer diluted IFN-γ to cell wells using a multichannel pipette. Transfer 10 μl per well, for a final well volume of 50 μl, and 50,000 cells per well. Each dilution should have at least 10 replicate wells.\nAdd 10 μl of media without IFN-γ to a set of 10 replicate wells to serve as an unstimulated control.",
    "Incubate cells in a standard humidified 37°C 5% CO2 incubator for three days. Proceed with staining and flow cytometry analysis as described below beginning with step 21.\nGraph the median fluorescence intensity of PD-L1 vs IFN-γ concentration in log. Generate a dose response curve and calculate the EC20 and EC50 for IFN-γ using GraphPad Prism or a similar program. In GraphPad Prism, the analysis method “[Agonist] vs. response – Find ECanything” can be used to calculate the EC20.\nNote: We recommend performing the screen with cells treated with the calculated EC20 of IFN-γ because we have observed that this relatively low level of stimulation allows for identification of both activators and inhibitors of PD-L1 expression. It also allows for the identification of compounds which might only have a moderate effect on PD-L1 expression but still present interesting avenues for future research. Treatment with higher levels of IFN-γ might eclipse the effect of compounds which activate PD-L1 expression, because expression may “max out” at a certain point. However, if the investigator is only interested in inhibitors of PD-L1 expression (or a different protein for which this protocol might be adapted), it may be more relevant to treat cells with a higher level of cytokine stimulation, such as the EC50 or EC80. Calculations can easily be adjusted accordingly with the “Find ECanything” function in GraphPad prism.\nStimulate cells with IFN-γ and treat with compounds\nTiming: 1 day\nThe screen is initiated by stimulating THP-1 cells and treating with screening compounds. This assay is designed to detect compounds which decrease or increase PD-L1 expression.\nIf compound source plates are frozen, remove them from the freezer at least 2 h before the planned transfer of compounds to allow ample time for them to equilibrate to approximately 20°C.",
    "Ensure plates are well sealed with an aluminum seal when they are removed from and returned to cold storage.\nAfter compound source plates have equilibrated to approximately 20°C, mix them well by vortexing at a high speed with the HT-91002 microplate orbital shaker in order to ensure the compounds are well dissolved following thawing. Plates should be vortexed for at least 1 min, until compounds are completely dissolved.\nAfter the compound plates have been mixed, centrifuge them at approximately 20–25°C (a refrigerated centrifuge will cause DMSO in the source plates to freeze) for 10 min at 1000 × g in order to ensure no compound remains on the aluminum foil seals. This is critical to ensure there is no cross contamination between wells.\nMix THP-1 cells well. Count THP-1 cells with a hemocytometer and 0.4% Trypan Blue.\nCalculate the number of cells needed for the screen. You will need 21 million viable cells per full 384 well plate.\nMeasure out sufficient THP-1 cells for the screen. Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 300 × g.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend in fresh culture media at a concentration of 1 million cells per mL (21 mL per screening plate).\nPipette 1 mL of resuspended cells per plate into a separate centrifuge tube. These cells will be kept as unstimulated controls.\nAdd IFN-γ to the main tube of cells to a concentration equivalent to the EC20 of activation as determined in the previous IFN-γ titration section. In our hands, this is frequently around 50 ng/mL. Mix well by inverting the tube or pipetting up and down 5 to 10 times.",
    "Distribute IFN-γ stimulated cells to the first 23 columns of the black 384 well assay plates, 50 μl per well (50,000 cells per well). Distribute the unstimulated cells to column 24, also at 50 μl per well.\nNote: The placement of control wells within the plate can be altered as the investigator prefers.\nCritical: If a multidrop or other reagent dispenser is being used to distribute cells, about 5 mL of extra cell suspension should be prepared, at the same concentration of cells and IFN-γ. This is to account for the dead volume of the reagent dispenser tubing and loss of cells during priming of the tubing.\nCarefully label or barcode cell plates so they are clearly matched to compound source plates.\nRemove the aluminum foil seal from a compound plate. Use the BioMek FX to transfer 100 nl of compound from the compound source plate to the cell plate. Seal compound plate with a new aluminum foil seal.\nRepeat step 18 for each assay plate and compound source plate pair.\nIncubate cells at 37°C 5% CO2 for 3 days.\nStain cells for flow cytometry analysis\nTiming: 1 day\nAfter cells have been incubated for 3 days with IFN-γ and compounds, they can be stained for flow cytometry analysis. All centrifuge steps are performed for 5 min at 300 × g, at 4°C, unless otherwise noted. All reagents should be kept at 4°C or on ice unless otherwise noted.\nNote: This protocol is intended to detect cell-surface expressed PD-L1 and as such does not require a permeabilization step. The detection of intracellular targets will require membrane permeabilization with reagents such as saponin or Triton X-100 and likely will require further optimization. Permeabilization should only be performed on cells which have already been fixed.",
    "Remove vials of Fixable Viability Dye (Thermo fisher Scientific) 660 from the freezer to allow them to thaw and equilibrate to approximately 20°C. Do not place vials on ice, as this will prevent the DMSO solvent from thawing.\nCentrifuge cell plates.\nAspirate supernatant with the plate washer, leaving a thin layer of supernatant covering the pelleted cells.\nWash cells by dispensing 80 μl cold (around 4°C) DPBS without calcium or magnesium per well, then centrifuge and aspirate supernatant. From this point onwards, the plates should be kept on ice or refrigerated as much as possible. (Troubleshooting 1)\nNote: Cells are initially washed with DPBS, not FACS buffer, as protein-free DPBS reduces the background staining of the viability dye.\nNote: Fixable viability dyes are available in several colors. We chose this color (660, detected in the APC channel on most flow cytometers) because it is excited by the red laser on our Cyan ADP flow cytometer, whereas the fluorophore for our PD-L1 antibody is excited by our blue laser. This minimizes the possibility of spectral overlap between the two fluorophores. However, other color viability dyes are acceptable and should be selected with consideration of your chosen flow cytometer’s optical configuration.\nRepeat step 24.\nWhile the cells are centrifuging, mix viability dye concentrate by vortexing. Briefly spin down the tube with a benchtop microcentrifuge. Ensure the dye has completely thawed. Dilute the viability dye 1:1000 in cold PBS. Prepare 16 mL per plate, plus an extra 5 mL to account for the dead volume of the reagent dispenser tubing. Viability dye dilutions should always be prepared fresh.",
    "After the second wash cycle with DPBS (DPBS has been dispensed, cells have been centrifuged, and supernatant has been aspirated), dispense 40 μl diluted viability dye per well. Vortex each plate without a lid with the HT-91002 microplate orbital shaker at speed setting 700 (arbitrary units) for about 5 s to resuspend the cells. From this point onwards, plates should be protected from light. Incubate plates at 4°C, with gentle rocking or orbital shaking, in the dark, for 30 min.\nNote: If you are using the HT-91002 microplate orbital shaker, or an alternative shaker, for the first time, gradually increase the speed to find a setting where the plate can be shaken vigorously enough to resuspend the cells without spilling the contents of the plate. The investigator can ensure that cells are being thoroughly resuspended by looking at the plate with a standard light microscope.\nOptional: If you have not used the viability dye before, or if you are performing a flow cytometry assay with more than two colors, you can heat kill cells to create a positive control for viability dye staining. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for more information.\nFollowing the incubation, wash cells by dispensing 40 μl FACS buffer per well. Centrifuge.\nAspirate the supernatant with the plate washer. Wash cells again by dispensing 80 μl per well FACS buffer. Centrifuge.\nWhile cells are centrifuging, dilute Human FcR Blocking Reagent 1:20 in FACS buffer. 15 μl per well or about 6 mL per plate is required. FcR Blocking Reagent dilutions should always be prepared fresh.\nNote: The FcR Blocking Reagent prevents non-specific binding of antibodies to Fc receptors. Fc receptors are expressed on a variety of immune cells.",
    "After plates have been centrifuged, aspirate supernatant and dispense 15 μl per well diluted Human FcR Blocking Reagent. Vortex plates without lids using the plate shaker, at speed setting 700 for 5 to 10 s each.\nIncubate plates at 4°C, with gentle rocking or orbital shaking, in the dark, for 10 min.\nDuring this incubation, prepare antibody dilutions. The PE conjugated antibody against human PD-L1, should be diluted 1:60 in FACS buffer (for an ultimate dilution of approximately 1:150). Enough volume for 15 μl per well (about 6 mL per plate with dead volume) is required. Antibody dilutions should always be prepared fresh.\nNote: We have used an anti-PD-L1 antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) because PE is one of the brightest fluorophores available for flow cytometry. Brighter fluorophores may make it easier to distinguish antibody staining signal from background fluorescence. However, any other fluorophore which has minimal spectral overlap with the viability dye should be acceptable. Always confirm that a given fluorophore is compatible with your flow cytometer before selecting it.\nFollowing the 10 min incubation, without centrifuging the plates, dispense 15 μl per well of diluted antibody. We recommend leaving some wells unstained as a control. Vortex plates without lids using the plate shaker, at speed setting 700 for 5 to 10 s each.\nNote: The FcR Blocking Reagent does not need to be removed before adding the antibody solution.\nIncubate plates at 4°C, with gentle rocking or orbital shaking, in the dark, for 45 min.\nFollowing the 45 min incubation, dispense 40 μl per well FACS buffer. Centrifuge plates.\nAspirate supernatant, dispense 80 μl per well FACS buffer. Centrifuge plates.\nAspirate supernatant, vortex plates without lids using the plate shaker, at speed setting 700 for 5 to 10 s each.",
    "Dispense 40 μl per well 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron microscopy Services), diluted from the 32% stock in DPBS. 4% PFA solution should be prepared fresh.\nCritical: PFA is hazardous and should be handled in a fume hood using appropriate PPE and disposed of properly.\nIncubate for 15 min at approximately 20°C, with gentle rocking or orbital shaking, with plates protected from light.\nDispense 40 μl per well FACS buffer. Centrifuge plates, aspirate supernatant, and vortex plates to resuspend cells. PFA waste should be collected and handled as hazardous chemical waste and disposed of according to local regulations and institutional policies.\nDispense 50 μl per well FACS buffer. Vortex plates again to ensure cells are resuspended and well mixed. The plates are now ready to analyze.\nPause Point: Stained, fixed plates can be stored at 4°C, in the dark before flow cytometry analysis for 1 week.\nFlow cytometry analysis\nTiming: 1–2 h per plate\nThis protocol describes flow cytometry analysis using a Beckman Coulter ADP flow cytometer with a HyperCyt auto-sampler.\nSet up flow cytometer for analysis according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ensure the exact same conditions and settings are used for each plate.\nBefore analyzing plates en masse, analyze a few control wells to ensure the flow cytometer is working properly.\nSet gates:\nFSC-A vs. SSC-A to identify cells and eliminate debris\nFSC-H vs. FSC-A or FSC-H vs. Pulse Width to eliminate doublets\nAPC-A vs. FSC-A to gate on viable cells. Fixable viability dye 660 is detected in the APC channel. Viable cells will have less staining with the fixable viability dye.\nPE-A vs. FSC-A, or PE-A histogram to determine PD-L1+ cells. Use no IFN-γ and/or IFN-γ + vehicle control wells to determine gates for PD-L1 high or low expression.",
    "Analyze plates. The exact parameters of the analysis may need to be optimized by the investigator, especially if a different flow cytometer is used. We used the following protocol with the HyperView software and HyperCyt autosampler. Using this system, all wells in one plate are initially acquired continuously and data are stored as a single FCS file. (Troubleshooting 2)\nPump speed: 15 rpm\nPrime: 60 s with sheath fluid\nPre-shake: 15 s 3500 rpm\nSample: 7 s\nUp time: 3 s\nProbe rinse: After every 12 wells, 1 s with FACS clean solution, 1 s with water\nInter-well shake: After every 12 wells, shake 4 s 3500\nPost run flush: 60 s, sheath fluid.\nNote: The HyperCyt samples wells for the set “Sample time” and then takes up a bubble of air set by the “Up time”. This air bubble allows the HyperView software and the investigator to identify different wells when FSC is plotted against time. Refer to the HyperCyt and HyperView manufacturer’s instructions for more details.\nUse the Well Identification function in the HyperView software to identify individual wells. Analysis can be performed in HyperView, or FCS files for each well can be exported for analysis in other flow cytometry analysis software such as FlowJo."
