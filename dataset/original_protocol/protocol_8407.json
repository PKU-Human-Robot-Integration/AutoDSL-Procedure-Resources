    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Wyoming. All procedures, including electrophysiological recordings, are carried out at room temperature, approximately 23 °C. All methods described here are optimized for recording tectal neurons from tadpoles between developmental stage 42 and 49 (staged according to Neiuwkoop and Faber15).\n1. In Vivo Preparation\nAnesthetize the tadpole.\n\t\nPlace the tadpole in a small Petri dish containing Steinberg's solution with 0.01% MS-222 for approximately 5 min.\n\t\t​NOTE: MS-222 aka \"Tricaine\" is a common fish and amphibian anesthetic. The tadpoles are raised in the Steinberg's solution in mM: 0.067 KCl, 0.034 Ca(NO3)2•4H2O, 0.083 MgSO4•7H2O, 5.8 NaCl, 4.9 HEPES.\nEnsure the tadpole is deeply anaesthetized (non-responsive and no longer swimming) before proceeding to step 2.\nSecure the anesthetized tadpole to a submerged silicone block on the floor of the dissecting/recording dish.\n\t\nUse a disposable transfer pipette to move the anaesthetized tadpole to a dissection/recording dish containing external recording solution (115 mM of NaCl, 2 mM of KCl, 3 mM of CaCl2, 3 mM of MgCl2, 5 mM of HEPES, 1 mM of glucose; adjust pH to 7.25 using 10 N of NaOH, osmolarity 255 mOsm).\n\t\t\nTo minimize spontaneous muscle twitches, add the acetylcholine receptor blocker, tubocurarine (100 µM) to the external solution. (Typically, this is done by using a 200 µL pipette to add 100 µL of a 10 mM tubocurarine stock to 10 mL of external solution).\nUsing insect pins, secure the tadpole, dorsal side up, to a submerged block of silicone elastomer (such as Sylgard 184, see Materials Table for details), which has been glued to the dissecting dish floor.",
    "Note: The placement of the pins is critical: place them on either side of the brain, sufficiently caudal to avoid impaling the afferent RGC axons that project from the eye and enter the brain just anterior to the optic tectum (Figure 1A).\nFillet the brain along the midline.\n\t\nFor a clear view of the brain, remove the skin overlying the brain by making a superficial incision along the midline using a sterile 25-G needle.\nFillet the brain along the same midline axis by inserting the needle into the neural tube and pulling gently upward (dorsally) such that the dorsal portion of the tube is cleanly cut (severed) while leaving the floor plate intact (Figure 1B).\n\t\t​NOTE: It is important that the floor plate of the neural tube be left intact because the afferent sensory inputs enter the tectum via the floor plate.\nRemove the transparent ventricular membrane that covers the tectal neurons.\n\t\nMove the recording dish to the electrophysiology rig and use a broken glass pipette tip to remove the ventricular membrane overlying the tectal neuron cell bodies. Break the tip by lightly dragging it across a delicate task wiper.\nScrew the pipette into the pipette holder and lower it down to the optic tectum via the micromanipulator.\nUse the broken pipette to peel the ventricular membrane away from the tectum.\n\t\tNOTE: It is not necessary to remove the membrane from the entire tectum; a small window will suffice and provide access to plenty of neurons.\nObtain the whole cell patch clamp recordings.\n\tNOTE: The approach from this point forward is similar to carrying out whole cell patch clamp recordings from mouse brain slices as described in Segev, et al.16(Figure 1C).\nRecord the tectal neuron responses to a whole field flash of light projected onto the retina.",
    "To project a whole field flash of light onto the retina, place an optic fiber adjacent to the tadpole's eye. At the other end of the optic fiber is an LED in line with a variable resistor that allows for the light luminance to be controlled. Trigger the LED by the digital output of the amplifier. In this way, whole field flashes of varying intensities of light can be recorded (Figure 4A).\n2. Whole Brain Preparation\nPerform steps 1.1 to 1.3.\n\tNote: There is no need for tubocurarine in the external solution for this preparation.\nIsolate the brain.\n\t\nUse a 25-G needle to sever the hindbrain (Figure 2A).\nTo isolate the whole brain from the tadpole, gently run the needle underneath the brain, in a caudal-to-rostral direction to sever all lateral and ventral connective tissue and nerve fibers.\nSecure the brain to a block of silicone elastomer.\n\t\nOnce completely freed, secure the brain to a block of silicon elastomer by placing one pin through one of the olfactory bulbs and another pin through the hindbrain (Figure 2B). This is the optimal configuration for recording from tectal neurons.\nMove the dish containing the pinned whole brain preparation from the dissecting scope to the electrophysiology rig. Remove the ventricular membrane using a broken glass pipette as described in step 1.4.\nPlace a bipolar stimulating electrode on the optic chiasm (where the axon tracts from each eye cross at the midbrain) to directly activate the RGC axons.\n\t\nPlace the bipolar stimulating electrode rostral, and almost adjacent to, the large middle ventricle. The optic chiasm is located immediately rostral to the large middle ventricle (Figure 2B).",
    "Gently lower the stimulating electrode down onto the optic chiasm such that a small dent is formed in the tissue. The bipolar electrode is driven by a pulse stimulator which allows the strength of stimulation to be precisely controlled.\nPerform the whole cell patch clamp recording (Figure 2C) as described by Segev, et al.16\n3. Horizontal Brain Slice Preparation\nPerform steps 2.1 to 2.3.\nUse a razor blade to excise the most lateral fourth (which in vivo corresponds to the most dorsal fourth) of one side of one optic tectum. This cut is made parallel to the rostral-caudal plane as shown in Figure 3A.\nRe-pin the brain to the side of the silicone elastomer with the sliced side facing up (so that the somata and neuropil can be directly accessed for recording) and the ventricular surface of the brain facing away from the silicone elastomer block (Figure 3B) (so that a bipolar electrode can be placed on the optic chiasm).\nPerform the whole cell patch clamp or local filed potential recording (Figure 3C) as described by Segev, et al.16\nSubscription Required.
