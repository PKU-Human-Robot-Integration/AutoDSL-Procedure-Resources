    "Detection targets design Note: The primers and crRNAs used in this protocol for 10 pathogens (Table 1) have been experimentally and clinically validated with excellent effectiveness. Select detection targets. Manual screening of species-specific DNA data from bioinformatics; the screening principles are:To facilitate primer design, DNA length is preferably longer than 200 bp.DNA fragment without repetitive sequences.DNA fragment contains PAM sequences (5′-TTTN-3′) of Cas12a.Design crRNA.Find PAM sequences (5′-TTTN-3′) within the DNA target region.Select the sequence 20 bp downstream of the PAM sequence as the target of crRNA. Replace the T-base in the 20 bp target sequence with a U-base. Place the target sequence downstream of the crRNA backbone sequence (5′-UAAUUUCUACUAAGUGUAGAU-3′).Note: The base distribution of the target sequence should be balanced, with a GC content of 40%–80%. We also recommend using crRNA design software, e.g., CHOPCHOP (https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/[href=https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/]).Use NCBI Primer-BLAST primer design software to select primers.The input sequence is the upstream and downstream sequence of the crRNA target site.Set the Primer parameters as default parameters.Set Primer Pair Specificity Checking Parameters Database as Refseq representative genomes, and Organism as Homo sapiens (taxid: 9606).Pick a primer pair predicted without non-specific amplification.Experimental validationFor example, for the 10 sets of primers and crRNAs used in this protocol, each set of primers and crRNAs needs to ensure that no non-specific signals are detected for the remaining pathogens and human genomic DNA.DNA extraction from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) sample Biosafety notes: DNA extraction procedure should be performed in a biological safety cabinet to ensure user safety. Wear biological protecting clothing, gloves, and masks during operation. DNA extraction was performed referring to the Quick-DNA/RNA Pathogen Miniprep kit instructions. The procedure is as follows:Add 800 μL of DNA/RNA shield to each 200 μL of BALF sample and mix well by using vortexer.Centrifuge at 16,000× g for 1 min.",
    "Transfer up to 200 μL of the supernatant into a 1.5 mL nuclease-free tube.Add 2 μL of proteinase K and mix well.Add 400 μL of pathogen DNA/RNA buffer. Mix well and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Transfer the mixture into a Zymo-Spin IIC column in a collection tube and centrifuge at 16,000× g for 30 s. Discard the flowthrough.Add 500 μL of pathogen DNA/RNA wash buffer to the Zymo-Spin IIC column and centrifuge at 16,000× g for 30 s. Discard the flowthrough.Repeat the previous step.Add 500 μL of ethanol (95%–100%) to the Zymo-SpinTM IIC column and centrifuge at 16,000× g for 1 min to ensure that the ethanol is removed. Discard the collection tube and transfer the Zymo-SpinTM IIC column into a new nuclease-free 1.5 mL tube.Add 25–50 μL of nuclease-free water at 65 °C directly to the matrix of the column and centrifuge at 16,000× g for 1 min to elute the DNA.Measure DNA concentration using a NanoDrop and adjust DNA concentration to 100 ng/μL.Note: The DNA yield extracted from 200 μL of BALF is 8–43 μg. Depending on the patient's situation and operating procedure, typically 200 μL of BALF is sufficient for subsequent analysis. If the DNA yield is low, centrifuge the BALF sample at 12,000× g for 5 min, discard the supernatant, and retain 200 μL of bottom liquid. PCR amplification enrichment of target DNA sequences to be tested For one BALF sample DNA, prepare 10 PCR reactions using amplification primers, one for each of the 10 pathogenic bacteria.Setting up the positive and negative controls: the templates for the positive and negative controls are the genomic DNA of the corresponding pathogen and nuclease-free water, respectively.Prepare the PCR reactions in a 0.2 mL PCR tube.table:",

Preparation of premixes is recommended to improve experimental efficiency. With a pipette set at 15 μL and keeping the plate on ice, mix the reaction by pipetting the entire solution up and down 10 times.Note: Pipetting 10 times can ensure sufficient mixing of the reaction solution. Avoid excessive bubbles in the reaction solution; any trace bubbles will clear after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C in the next step. Place the plate in a fluorescence plate reader. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min, then measure the fluorescence values of each reaction well (excitation wavelength: 485 nm; emission wavelength: 535 nm)."
