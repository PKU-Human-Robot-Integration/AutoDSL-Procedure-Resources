This size of nanoparticles is used because they can be synthesized with high quality and reproducibility,5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] and the protocol of functionalization with nucleic acids has been well established.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2244-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of gold nanoparticle synthesis using the citrate reduction method\nIn a fume hood, prepare aqua regia: mix 3:1 concentrated HCl:HNO3 in an open and large container.\nCaution: Be exceptionally careful when preparing and working with aqua regia and wear personal protective equipment. Aqua regia should be freshly prepared and should not be stored in closed containers, as these may explode. Aqua regia should be disposed by carefully diluting and neutralizing.\nImmerse all the glassware (500 mL two-neck flask, magnetic stir bar, stopper, condenser and Erlenmeyer) in the freshly prepared aqua regia for at least 15 min. Afterwards, rinse the glassware with Millipore-filtered water.\nCritical: High-quality nanoparticles are essential for the success of the experiment. Care should be taken to make sure that no contamination with other metals is introduced during nanoparticle synthesis.\nAdd 225 mL of 1 mM HAuCl4 (88.61 mg) into the rounded bottom two-neck flask and place the flask in the heating mantle.\nPlace the stirrer inside the flask.\nConnect the condenser to one neck of the flask and place the stopper in the other neck.\nTurn on the heating mantle to reflux while stirring.\nWhen the solution begins to reflux remove the stopper and swiftly add 25 mL of 38.8 mM (285 mg) sodium citrate.\nAdd the stopper back into the two-neck flask.",
    "Note: A color change from pale yellow to deep red should be observed in approximately 1 min.\nAllow the system to reflux for another 30 min.\nMaintain stirring and turn off heating.\nAllow the system to cool to room temperature (23°C–25°C) protected from light.\nTransfer the colloidal solution to a 250 mL amber flask with a ground glass cap.\nNote: The obtained gold nanoparticles should be spherical under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with a diameter of approximately 14 nm (13–15 nm), a Surface Plasmon Resonance peak at approximately 520 nm, with a correspondent extinction value of 2.33×108 M-1.cm-1 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] and the solution should have a burgundy red color.\nUsing a quartz cuvette, record a UV-Visible spectrum (300–900 nm) of the gold nanoparticles.\nDetermine the concentration using the absorbance at the peak in the Beer-Lambert law (  A = ε × l × c  , in which: A is the NP absorbance at the peak, ε is gold molar absorptivity (2.33 × 108 M-1.cm-1), l is the length of light path (1 cm) and c is the concentration). Consider any dilution that is performed previously to the measurement.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2244-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Note: The wavelength (in nm) corresponding to the absorbance at the peak is the Surface Plasmon Resonance peak. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] shows an example of morphology (3A), size (3B), zeta-potential (3C) and UV-Visible spectra (3D) of the resulting nanoparticles.\nPause point: The prepared nanoparticles are stable for months when stored in a clean container (preferably glass) at 4°C. Gold nanoparticles should not be frozen, as this will induce particle aggregation and prevent further use. Maximum time for storage – 2 months at 4°C.\nFunctionalization of the gold nanoparticle’s surface with PEG\nTiming: 20 h\nThis step provides indications for the functionalization of 14 nm spherical gold nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG), to improve their stability and biocompatibility (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2244-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic representation of PEGylated gold nanoparticle synthesis\nMix 41.7 mL of a 12 nM stock solution of citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (final concentration, 10 nM) with 150 μL of a 1 mg/mL stock solution of (O-[2-(3-Mercaptopropionylamino)ethyl]-O′-methylpolyethylene glycol, 5000, Maximum time for storage – 6 months at −20°C) (PEG) (final concentration: 0.003 mg/mL) in an aqueous solution of SDS (final concentration: 0.028%, Maximum time for storage – 3 months at 25°C).\nAdd DEPC-treated water to reach the desired final volume.\nIncubate at room temperature (23°C–25°C) in a rotative shaker for 16 h.\nNote: The PEG powder stock should be dissolved in DMSO to intermediate concentrations, aliquoted and stored at −20°C to maintain the integrity of the thiols and avoid the formation of disulfide bridges. Prepare the working solution of PEG only at the time of functionalization by diluting an aliquot to the concentration of 1 mg/mL in DEPC-treated water.",
    "Note: The final PEG concentration can be adjusted, depending on the objective. For instance, gold nanoparticles can be previously incubated with different amounts of PEG to estimate which concentration corresponds to a certain percentage of PEG molecules at the nanoparticle’s surface, and then that concentration can be used for the functionalization step in a larger scale.\nDistribute the volume in centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to remove the PEG excess.\nNote: After centrifugation, the tubes should have an oily red deposition at the bottom and a clear supernatant.\nCollect 80%–90% of the supernatant and store it at 4°C for subsequent analysis. Keep track of the removed volume.\nResuspend the deposition in DEPC-treated water.\nRepeat step 9 twice.\nNote: In the end, three supernatants should have been collected.\nAfter the final centrifugation, redisperse the deposition in DEPC-treated water.\nNote: If the supernatant is not clear after the first centrifugation, collect it and centrifuge it again.\nUsing a quartz cuvette, record a UV-Visible spectrum of the PEGylated gold nanoparticles and determine the concentration as described in step 7.\nNote: The wavelength (in nm) corresponding to the absorbance at the peak is the Surface Plasmon Resonance peak.\nTaking into consideration the concentration of PEG added to the nanoparticles, prepare a calibration curve of PEG, in triplicate, by mixing the appropriate amount of stock solution of PEG for each concentration with 100 μL of phosphate buffer 0.5 M (pH=7).\nAdd DEPC-treated water up to 300 μL.\nFor sample preparation, mix, in triplicate, 200 μL of the supernatants retrieved in steps 9 and 10 and mix with 100 μL of phosphate buffer 0.5 M (pH=7).\nAdd the calibration curve concentrations and the supernatant samples to the wells of a 96-well plate.",
    "Add 7 μL of 5 mg/mL 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), to each of these mixtures and incubate for 10 min at room temperature (23°C–25°C).\nNote: If other PEG concentrations were used for functionalization, the calibration curve concentrations also need to be adjusted. DTNB is used to estimate the free thiols in the supernatants and should be freshly prepared before use by dissolving the powder in phosphate buffer 0.5 M (pH=7). A yellow color is expected to develop when many free thiols are present, which estimates that many PEG molecules are present. This should be observable at least in the higher concentrations of the calibration curve.\nRecord the absorbance values at 412 nm and an UV-Visible absorption spectrum (290–600 nm) of all samples.\nUse the calibration curve to calculate the amount of free thiols (and consequently, of PEG) in the supernatants and subtract this value to the amount initially added to the solution when functionalization started.\nNote: In this step it is important to know the total volume of initial solution and the volumes of supernatant collected. This process estimates the number of PEG chains and is used to determine the amount of PEG molecules attached to the AuNPs. To do this, use the equation of a straight line, which in this case is the tendency line that is obtained from the calibration curve data points:   y  = m x + b  , in which y is the absorbance at 412 nm, m is the slope of the line, x is the concentration/amount of PEG and b is the intercept.\nPause point: Store the nanoparticles functionalized with PEG at 4°C, protected from light, for 6 months. Save an aliquot of these nanoparticles for later characterization.\nSynthesis of gold nanobeacons\nTiming: 20 h",
    "This step provides indications for the functionalization of 14 nm PEGylated spherical gold nanoparticles with molecular beacons to develop a theranostic nanoconjugates for recognition, detection and inhibition of specific nucleic acids (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2244-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic representation of the synthesis of gold nanobeacons\nMix the lyophilized thiolated oligonucleotide with 1 mL of DEPC-treated water.\nCollect an aliquot of 100 μL and store it at −20°C for later use.\nAdd 100 μL of 1 M Dithiothreitol (DTT, Maximum time for storage – 6 months at 4°C) to the remaining 900 μL of oligonucleotide to attain a final concentration of 0.1 M in DTT.\nIncubate in a rotative shaker at room temperature (23°C–25°C) for two hours or overnight (16 h) at 4°C.\nNote: DTT is used to quantitatively reduce disulfide bonds and to maintain monothiols in a reduced state. At low concentrations, DTT stabilizes enzymes and other proteins that possess free sulfhydryl groups and was shown to restore activity lost by oxidation groups in vitro.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nExtract one volume (500 μL) of thiol-modified oligonucleotide with two volumes (1,000 μL) of ethyl acetate, to remove DTT. Mix thoroughly.\nCentrifuge at room temperature (23°C–25°C) for 5 min at 20,000 × g. Discard the organic phase (upper phase).\nRepeat steps 15 and 16 twice.\nAfter the third extraction, purify the remaining aqueous phase using a desalting NAP-5 column, according to the manufacturer instructions. Use 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH=8, maximum time for storage – 2 months at 4°C) as eluent.\nWash the column three times with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH=8).\nAdd 500 μL of oligonucleotide solution. Let all the solution pass through the column – the oligonucleotides will be retained in the column and the remaining DTT/ethyl acetate will be washed.",
    "Prepare a 1.5 mL Eppendorf for collection and then add 1 mL of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH=8) to the column to release the oligonucleotide.\nNote: This step can be repeated with the remaining 500 μL of DTT/ethyl acetate extracted oligonucleotide, using the same column. To do this, wash the column again and repeat the process.\nQuantify the purified oligonucleotide by UV-Visible spectroscopy using a Nanodrop and check the spectra for the existence of contaminations with DTT or ethyl acetate.\nMix the purified oligonucleotide with the PEGylated AuNPs previously prepared in a 1:100 AuNPs:oligonucleotide ratio.\nAdd ionic strength solution A (10 mM phosphate buffer pH=8, 2% SDS, maximum time for storage – 2 months at 4°C) to achieve a final concentration of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH=8) and 0.01% (w/v) SDS.\nSonicate for 10 s and incubate for 20 min at room temperature (23°C–25°C) in a rotative shaker.\nNote: A conventional ultrasonic bath, 40 kHz, 135 W can be used for the sonication process.\nSequentially increase the ionic strength of the solution by adding the respective volume of ionic strength solution B (10 mM phosphate buffer pH=8, 1.5 M NaCl, 0.01% SDS, maximum time for storage – 2 months at 4°C) up to a final concentration of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH=8), 0.05 M NaCl and 0.01% (w/v) SDS.\nSonicate for 10 s and incubate for 20 min at room temperature (23°C–25°C) in a rotative shaker.\nNote: Ionic strength solutions A and B should be stored at 4°C. Before starting the protocol, place them at room temperature until no precipitate is observed. If any precipitate persists, warm the solution with agitation until it disappears.\nRepeat step 22, thrice, for final concentrations of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 M of NaCl.",
    "After the last addition, incubate for 16 h at room temperature (23°C–25°C), in a rotative shaker, protected from light.\nNote: Carefully examine the aspect of the nanoparticles while increasing the ionic strength of the solution. NPs may be destabilized by the addition of salt and the color of the solution can be altered if aggregation occurs. An example of the aspect of the nanoparticles and their absorption spectra when aggregated is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D. See troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nCentrifuge at 4°C for 20 min at 20,000 × g.\nNote: There should be an oily precipitate at the bottom of the tube.\nCollect 80%–90% of the supernatant and store it at 4°C for subsequent analysis. Keep track of the removed volume.\nResuspend the deposition in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH=8.\nRepeat step 24, twice. In the end, three supernatants should have been collected.\nAfter the final centrifugation, redisperse the deposition in 20%–30% of the initial volume in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH=8.\nCritical: Be careful not to disturb the precipitate while removing the supernatant, as redispersing the Au-nanobeacons during this step can result in major losses of Au-nanobeacons and contamination of the supernatant with Au-nanobeacons.\nRecord a UV-Visible spectrum of the Au-nanobeacons and determine the concentration as described in step 7.\nNote: The wavelength (in nm) corresponding to the absorbance at the peak is the Surface Plasmon Resonance peak.\nPrepare a calibration curve, in triplicate, using the oligonucleotide aliquot collected in step 14a.\nMix the appropriate amount of stock solution of fluorescent oligonucleotide with ionic strength solutions A and B to obtain a final volume of 100 μL with a final concentration of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH=8), 0.3 M NaCl and 0.01% (w/v) SDS.",
    "Critical: Use at least 5 different concentrations to build the calibration curve to ensure that it is possible to quantify the amount of oligonucleotide that did not bind.\nAdd all the calibration curve concentrations and 100 μL of each supernatant previously collected in steps 24 and 25, in triplicate, to the wells of a microplate for fluorescence-based assays, 96-well.\nRecord the fluorescence emission of all the samples.\nNote: Be sure to use the appropriate excitation and detection wavelengths for the fluorophores in use (i.e., for 6-FAM excite the fluorophore at 495 nm and read the emission at 520 nm).\nUse the equation of the calibration curve to determine the amount of fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides that are present in each supernatant.\nNote: To do this use the equation of a straight line, which in this case is the tendency line that is obtained from the calibration curve data points:   y  = m x + b  , in which y is the emission at the wavelength that corresponds to the chosen fluorophore, m is the slope of the line, x is the concentration and b is the intercept.\nSubtract the result to the amount of oligonucleotides initially added in step 20 to obtain the amount of oligonucleotides that are present at the surface of the oligonucleotides. Use this value to ascertain the final AuNP:oligonucleotides ratio.\nFully characterize the Au-nanobeacons by determining the hydrodynamic radius using Dynamic Light Scattering and the surface charge by measuring the Zeta Potential.\nNote: The size, morphology and functionalization of Au-nanobeacons can be evaluated by staining a sample with 2% phosphotungstic acid (maximum time for storage – 3 months at 25°C) for 60–90 s and analyzing by TEM.",
    "Pause point: Store the Au-nanobeacons at 4°C, protected from light, for 3 months without loss of fluorescence signal or signs of aggregation.\nCharacterization of gold nanobeacons\nTiming: 10 to 120 min, depending on the assay\nThis step provides a characterization of the nanobeacons in terms of their interactions with the respective targets and in terms of their stability under different conditions and upon different stimuli that can also be found in cells, such as temperature, pH, reductive environments and presence of nucleases.\nHybridization specificity.\nMix 1 nM of Au-nanobeacons with complementary and non-complementary targets for a final volume of 100 μL, in triplicate.\nNote: To better observe the nanobeacon behavior with different concentrations of target, it can be incubated with different target/non-complementary target concentrations, for instance: a) a lower concentration than the nanobeacon’s; b) the same concentration as the nanobeacon’s; c) five times the nanobeacon’s concentration. The targets depend on the downstream applications of the nanobeacons and can be single-stranded nucleic acid molecules (e.g., miRNAs), double-stranded DNA molecules, for example.\nAdd the samples to a black 96-well plate and record the emission (fluorescence intensity) of the Au-nanobeacons at 37°C, every two minutes, for 120 min, using a plate reader.\nNote: Use the appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths for the fluorophore in use.\nAs a control, add in other wells the same concentration of Au-nanobeacons alone i.e., not mixed with complementary/non-complementary target.\nPlot the results against the variable in study (i.e., amount of complementary/non-complementary target, time).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2244-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "Note: An increase in fluorescence is expected to be observed with time in the condition “Au-nanobeacon + complementary target” and no relevant variation should be observed in the condition “Au-nanobeacon + non-complementary target”, when compared to Au-nanoconjugates alone. Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A shows an example of the expected results.\nCritical: See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nHairpin reversible denaturation/renaturation test.\nIncubate 1 nM of the Au-nanobeacons in phosphate buffer 10 mM (pH=8) at increasing temperatures ranging from 5°C to 80°C.

Record the emission every two minutes considering the excitation/emission wavelengths of the fluorophore in use.\nPlot the resulting emission values against temperature.\nNote: The graph should be similar to denaturing (step 32a) and renaturing (step 32b) DNA profiles, indicating if the Au-nanobeacons can reversibly change their hairpin conformation. An example of these results is shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B.\nNote: This test was performed using a qRT-PCR equipment, which allows to design temperature gradients and to record the fluorescence emitted at each temperature.\nCritical: See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nStability in reductive environments.\nMix, in triplicate, 1 nM of Au-nanobeacons with different concentrations of glutathione (e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 100 mM, maximum time for storage – 2 months at 4°C).\nTransfer the samples to a microplate for fluorescence-based assays, 96-well (100 μL/well) and incubate at 37°C for 120 min, acquiring the emission data every 2 min.\nNote: Consider the correct excitation/emission wavelengths for the fluorophore in use.\nRepeat the procedure with the same concentrations of DTT.\nPlot the emission data results against time. An example of the results is shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C.",
    "Note: Glutathione is an ideal reagent to test how Au-nanobeacons behave in reducing conditions as it exists in the organism and allows to mimic the endogenous microenvironment and its physiological concentration (1 mM). DTT is used to compare how the Au-nanobeacons react to other types of exogenous stimuli.\nCritical: If the emission data of the Au-nanobeacons is altered in the presence of concentrations equal or higher than 5 mM of reducing agents it is probable that the Au-nanobeacons are unstable and will not maintain their integrity in further experiments.\nStability in different temperatures.\nPrepare, in triplicate, 1 nM of Au-nanobeacons.\nTransfer the samples to a microplate for fluorescence-based assays, 96-well (100 μL/well) and incubate at different temperatures (e.g., 25, 30, 37, 40 and 45°C) for 60 min, acquiring the emission data every 2 min.\nNote: Consider the correct excitation/emission wavelengths for the fluorophore in use.\nPlot the emission data results against time.

Adjust the seeding density according to the type of cells that are being used, as cells have different growth rates.",
    "Critical: Usually, in an experiment starting from a confluent culture flask (75 cm2) and plating 1×105 cells per well in 24-well plates, for the equivalent to 50% confluence (surface coverage), use 100 μL of cell suspension plus 400 μL of complete growth medium, antibiotic-free, per well. However, this depends on the cells used and should be optimized.\nNote: For confocal microscopy experiments, cells should be seeded on sterile glass slides added to the bottom of the wells (e.g., for 24-well plates, use round coverslips with 12 mm diameter and <1.5 mm thickness). In case the cells do not adhere directly to the coverslips, these can be pre-treated with gelatin (2% w/v, in water) for 15 min at 37°C.\nNote: Confocal dishes could be used alternatively to glass slides on 24-well plates, as the latter are easily broken during removal from the plate.\nRemove the medium of each well and add the Au-nanobeacons targeting MRP1 at the chosen concentrations, in complete growth medium, to obtain a final volume of 500 μL/well.\nMix well to ensure even distribution of nanoparticles in the well. Consider preparing different plates to test the effects on different time-points.\nIncubate at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h.\nTo evaluate mRNA expression, collect and lyse the cells after 24 h for total RNA extraction (e.g., PureLink™ RNA Mini Kit) and prepare the samples for cDNA conversion (High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNase Inhibitor) following the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0017977_highcap_cDNA_RT_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0017977_highcap_cDNA_RT_UG.pdf]).\nUse the cDNA samples to perform RT-qPCR (TaqMan™ Fast Advanced Master Mix, using TaqMan probes for the target mRNA and for an endogenous control, such as GAPDH) following the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0025706_TaqManFastAdvMM_UG.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0025706_TaqManFastAdvMM_UG.pdf]).\nEvaluate the expression against the endogenous control and the fold-change relatively to the non-treated cells.

It uses a gold nanoparticle core decorated with a thiol-DNA hairpin that is labeled with a near-infrared dye (Quasar 705) and intercalated with 5-FU, and a thiol-DNA oligonucleotide which is labeled with a black-hole dark quencher (BHQ2). The system works in the same way as the one described in this protocol: when in hairpin configuration, the closeness of the near-infrared dye to the dark quencher promotes to fluorescence quenching. Hybridization of the DNA hairpin to a complementary target (in this case, the MRP1 mRNA) restores fluorescence emission, as the conformational reorganization causes the distance between the fluorophore and the quencher to increase, yielding a quantitative response.
