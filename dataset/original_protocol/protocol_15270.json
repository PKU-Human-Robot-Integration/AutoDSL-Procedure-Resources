    "1. Stool Samples\nStool samples should be stored frozen to preserve the RNA. To make a 10% fecal suspension, take approximately 0.1 g of thawed stool sample and complete to 1 ml with PBS.    \nAliquot in 200 μl to avoid repeated freezing and thawing. Store the aliquots at -70 °C. \nThaw and centrifuge aliquots at 4,000 g for 10 min before use in extraction. \n2. Preparation of Silica Particles for Extraction with Guanidine & Silica\nAt RT, suspend 30 g of silicon dioxide and complete with dH2O up to 250 mL.    \nAfter 24 hrs of sedimentation, remove 215 mL of the supernatant by suction. Add dH2O up to 250 mL, and suspend the silica pellet by shaking. \nAfter another 24 hrs, remove the supernatant by suction, and adjust the pH of the silica suspension to pH 2.0, using hydrochloric acid (HCl). Aliquot the silica suspension in glass bottles and autoclave. \n3. Preparation of L6 Buffer for Extraction with Guanidine & Silica\nAt RT, prepare L6 buffer by dissolving 60 g of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) and 1.3 g of  Triton X-100 in 50 mL of 0.1 M Tris hydrochloride, pH 6.4,  and 11 mL of a 0.2 M EDTA, pH 8.0 solution.  \n4.  Preparation of L2 Buffer for Extraction with Guanidine & Silica\nAt RT, prepare L2 buffer by dissolving 180 g of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) in 150 mL of 0.1 M Tris hydrochloride, pH 6.4.  \n5. Extraction Procedure \nIn each extraction a NoV positive stool sample, as positive control, and DEPC treated water, as negative control, should be included.    \nIn a micro-centrifuge tube mix the following; 1 mL of buffer L6, 20 μL of silica particles, and add 200 μL of the 10% fecal extract suspension. Vortex briefly and leave at RT for 15 min.",
    "Centrifuge the suspension at 6000 g for 10 s and wash the pellet with 1ml of buffer L2 twice, followed by two washes with 70% ethanol and one time with acetone. Dry the pellet in a dry heating block at 56 °C for 5 min. \nHydrate the RNA in the silica pellet by adding 50 μL of RNase-free dH20. Add 1 μL of RNasin, mix by inverting the tube and incubate at 56 °C for 15 min. \nCentrifuge for 3 min at full speed, in a tabletop centrifuge, and collect 40 μL of the supernatant containing the RNA. \nQuantify the extracted RNA samples using Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo scientific). Then store at -70 °C until use, up to 6 months. (Note: A better way to preserve total RNA intact is converting it into cDNA).\n6. Alternative Extraction Using the Commercial RNA QIAamp Viral RNA Kit\nFull instructions are found in the booklet provided with the QIAGEN kit. Briefly the procedure is as follows:\nPipet 560 μL of Buffer AVL containing the carrier RNA into a 1.5 mL tube, and add 140 μL of the 10% stool suspension. Mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 sec. Incubate at RT for 10 min.    \nAdd 560 μL of ethanol (96-100%) to the sample and mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 sec, then briefly centrifuge. \nApply 630 μL of this solution to a spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube. Centrifuge for 1 min at 6,000 g; then place the spin column into a clean 2 mL tube. \nWash the column containing bound RNA with 500 μL of Buffer AW1 and centrifuge at 6,000 g for 1 min. Place column in a clean 2 mL collection tube.",
    "Wash the column with 500 μL of Buffer AW2 and centrifuge at full speed (20,000 g or 14,000 rpm) for 3 min. \nPlace spin column in a clean 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tube, add 40 μL DEPC-treated water and elute the RNA at full speed. Repeat once for a final 80 μL of eluted RNA. \nQuantify the extracted RNA samples using Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo scientific). Then store at -70 °C until use, up to 6 months. (Note: A better way to preserve total RNA intact is converting it into cDNA).\n7. Detection of Norovirus in Extracted RNA by One-step Real Time RT-PCR with Specific Taqman Probes\nInstrument StepOnePlus Real Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems).\nMethodology\nWipe and Clean all work surfaces, pipettes, and centrifuges with RNase AWAY to remove any potential RNase contamination.    \nPipet the NoV GI and GII screening master mixes according to Table 1. Primers and Taqman probes are listed in Table 2. \nAliquot 10 μL of appropriate master mix to each reaction tube. \nAdd 5 μL of undiluted unknown sample RNA, DEPC-treated water as negative control, or GI respectively GII positive control RNA, to the corresponding reaction wells. All samples should be run in duplicate. Positive controls and standards with concentration of 300 μg/μL and 500 μg/μL respectively were provided by National Calicivirus Laboratory Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nCentrifuge the reaction plate at 6,000 g for 10 sec. \nIn the experiment properties screen; define and select a type of experiment for the run. Make sure TaqMan reagents are displayed as the reagents type, and that Pre-PCR read and amplification are selected. \nRun 15 μL reactions using the thermal profile in Table 3. \nAnalyze the results. \n8. Genotyping of NoV GI and GII Using Conventional RT-PCR and Sequencing",
    "(It's not mentioned in this video since it's a common and widely used method.)\nInstrument. Applied Biosystems StepOne and StepOnePlus Real Time PCR Systems with the Quantitec template.\nMethodology \nBefore genotyping, the genogroup (GI or GII) of the samples are determined by the screening RT-PCR described above. GI NoV RNA has to be amplified with the GI genotyping master mix and the GII NoV RNA with the GII genotyping master mix.    \nPipet the NoV GI and GII genotyping master mixes according to Table 4. Primers GI SKF/SKR and G2 SKF/SKR are listed in Table 5. \nAliquot 45 μL of the appropriate master mix to 0.2 mL reaction tubes. \nAdd 5 μL of DEPC-treated water to each negative control tube, and 5 μL of pre-screened, NoV (GI and/or GII) positive RNA to the corresponding reaction tube. \nRun 50 μL reactions using the thermal profile in Table 6. \nSend PCR products containing at least 100 ng/μL of the amplified capsid region to Macrogen Company for purification and sequencing. (9700 Great Seneca Hwy. Rockville, MD 20850 and $10 per sample per sequencing). \n9. Representative Results\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3232/3232fig1.jpg\nFigure 1 shows representative results from the Taqman One-Step RT-PCR when used to assay RNA extracted from stool samples from diarrheal children. The threshold cycle (Ct) for a positive sample was set at less or equal to Ct 37 for GI and Ct 39 for GII. The Ct-values for the positive controls were found to be less than 27 and 18 of the ORF1-ORF2 junction for GI and GII, respectively.

    "Figure 2 shows a head-to-head comparison of Ct values of in silica method guanidinium and QiAmp Viral RNA kit. Data of both tests fall very close to the equality line (slope = 1 and intercept = 0). This is confirmed by the Regression Analysis and the Correlation Coefficient.
