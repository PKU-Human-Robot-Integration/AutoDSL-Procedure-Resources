    "For adherent cellsRemove culture medium and wash the cell layer once with 5 ml of cold PBS (with cations; see Recipes) at room temperature (RT). Remove PBS and add 1 ml of enzyme-free dissociation reagent per T75 flask or 10 cm dish to dissociate the cells at RT.Transfer the flask or dish to 37 °C. After 1 min (minute), check if cells have started to detach. If not, keep them at 37 °C until detachment is obvious.Vigorously tap the sides of the flask or dish to dissociate the cells.After most cells have detached, re-suspend the cells in 9 ml of medium containing 10% FBS to obtain a single cell suspension. Adherent cells that are difficult to dissociate using enzyme-free dissociation reagent, the cells can be scraped off the flask or dish and resuspended as a single cell suspension in medium containing 10% FBS. Be careful allow clumped cells to settle.For single cell suspension obtained above and for cells growing in suspensionCount the cells–need at least 2 x 106 cells per ligand per replicate, if using 0.5 x 106 cells per reaction (0.5 x 106 cells: unstained cells to set the flow cytometer, 0.5 x 106 cells for negative control, 106 cells for test samples [Notch ligand-Fc]).Centrifuge the required cell volume in a 15 ml Falcon tube at 115 x g (1,000 rpm) for 10 min in a benchtop centrifuge (GMI, IEC, model: HN-SII) at RT.Aspirate the supernatant and wash the cell pellet in 10 ml ligand LBB (see Recipes). Be careful not to aspirate the cell pellet.Fix cells in 4% PFACentrifuge cells as above and aspirate supernatant.Add 1 ml of 4% PFA per 107 cells to the cell pellet and gently resuspend by vortexing in brief spurts in 4% PFA (see Recipes).",
    "Incubate cells in 4% PFA for 10 min at RT. Centrifuge at 115 x g (1,000 rpm) for 10 min and discard supernatant.Wash the cells twice more with 10 ml LBB.Resuspend cells to a final concentration of 106 cells/ml in LBB.Fixed cells can be stored at 4 °C for at least a month. The advantage of using fixed cells is that endocytosis of membrane receptors cannot occur, different cell types can be prepared and fixed on different days, and the ligand binding assay can be performed on all samples with each Notch ligand-Fc on the same day in one experiment, thereby reducing variation between samples. Unfixed cells can also be used for Notch ligand binding experiments. However, the cells should be used fresh from exponentially growing cultures at 37 °C, and washed in cold PBS, prior to assaying binding at 4 °C. It is important that endocytosis of Notch receptors is prevented and sodium azide at 0.05% can be included in the binding assay for that purpose. Cells that have a damaged plasma membrane can be identified using dyes like 7-amino actinomycin D (7-AAD), Hoechst 33342 and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in LBB added to cells just prior to flow cytometry, and subsequently gated out of the cells to be analyzed.Experimental designLabel 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and aliquot a fixed number of cells based on the following experimental design.Controls for the experiment:Unstained cells for background fluorescence: A mixture of equal numbers of each cell type to be assayed is aliquoted into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube so the final cell number is 0.5-1.0 x 106 cells in LBB. Mix briefly by vortexing. This sample is used to establish parameters in the flow cytometer.Negative controls-Fc tag alone or secondary antibody alone: Take an aliquot with 0.5-1.",
    "0 x 106 cells in LBB into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube for subsequent incubation with control-Fc or secondary antibody alone. A negative control is set up for each cell type.Test samples: Different Notch ligands tagged with Fc For each Notch ligand-Fc, aliquot 0.5-1.0 x 106 cells in LBB into separate 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Centrifuge cells aliquoted above at 420 x g (2,000 rpm) in a benchtop centrifuge (Eppendorf, model: 5417 C) for 5 min at 4 °C, and discard the supernatant.Wash cells with 1 ml ice cold LBB. Repeat the wash once and discard the supernatant.Add 50 μl FcR block (diluted 1:50 in LBB) to all cells, except the unstained control cells, which receive 50 μl LBB, and gently vortex.Incubate for 15 min on ice. Do not wash.Add 100 μl Notch ligand-Fc or Fc-tag alone (100-1,000 ng in 100 μl LBB). To unstained cells, or cells that will receive secondary antibody alone, add 100 μl LBB. Gently vortex each tube to mix.Incubate for 1 h on ice with intermittent mixing by hand every 15 min, or at 4 °C with rotation.Centrifuge at 420 x g (2,000 rpm) for 5 min at RT, and discard the supernatant.Wash cells with 1 ml ice cold LBB. Repeat wash once and discard the supernatant.Add 100 μl secondary anti-Fc antibody (1:100 in LBB) to all cell pellets, except the unstained cell pellet, and gently vortex to resuspend.Incubate for 30 min on ice, or at 4 °C with rotation. Cover tubes with aluminum foil to protect the samples from light.Centrifuge at 420 x g (2,000 rpm) for 5 min at RT, and discard the supernatant.Wash the cells with 1 ml ice cold LBB. Repeat wash once and discard supernatant.",
    "Add 250-500 μl of ice cold LBB to each cell pellet, mix and pass through the strainer cap of a 5 ml polystyrene round-bottom tube. This removes clumped cells immediately prior to flow cytometry. It is essential to have a single cell suspension prior to proceeding with flow cytometry–a) Clumped cells interfere with the analysis. b) Clumped cells can clog the flow cytometer.Proceed to flow cytometry. Care should be taken that samples are exposed to minimum light."
