    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSocial transfer of pain\nTiming: 1.5 h\nTiming: Up to the discretion of the experimenter. For time course evaluation, we suggest testing the mice at 0, 4, 24, and 48–72 h after the social interaction\nThis section describes the step-by-step protocol for the social transfer of pain. In this paradigm, a “bystander” mouse is exposed to a CFA-injected “demonstrator” mouse during a one-hour social interaction and subsequently tested for behavioral phenotypes associated with pain (e.g., von Frey mechanical sensitivity).\nNote: Prior to the first day of testing, mice are assigned to one of three treatment groups: control, pain (CFA), or bystander. Each animal is also assigned a partner within its cage, thereby forming pairs. Each pair will include a demonstrator mouse (which will exhibit pain) and a bystander mouse (which will interact with the pain mouse). Control mice are paired together (control + control) and each CFA mouse is paired with a bystander (CFA + Bystander). Thus, within each cage of 4, mice are assigned as either 2 pairs of control mice, or 2 CFA and 2 bystander mice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: We do not recommend performing an intraplantar saline injection in control mice to control for injection pain. We previously reported that intraplantar saline injection can induce hypersensitivity lasting for ∼3 days (Smith et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]), and our published and unpublished observations suggest that a range of nociceptive stimuli can lead to social transfer of pain. We thus suspect that the pain induced by saline injection could lead to social transfer of pain in control mice, resulting in preventable variability.",
    "Critical: Exposure to olfactory cues from mice in pain can alter the behavior of controls and introduce preventable variability in experimental results (Smith et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33] ; and see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Therefore, cages containing control mice must remain separate from those containing CFA-injected mice to avoid exposure to olfactory cues. Specifically, social transfer procedures and subsequent mechanical testing for control mice must be conducted separately from CFA and BY mice (in separate rooms, or in the same room at different times/different days). If testing control and CFA mice at different time points in the same room (ideally on different days), the room must be thoroughly cleaned between groups, with as much time as possible between groups. We have successfully tested control mice in the same room >2 h after CFA and bystander mice. Another option is to test the controls in the room first, followed by the CFA and bystander mice. The time of day and/or experimental room should be counterbalanced equally across experimental groups to avoid any confounding factors.\nPrepare the testing room.\nEnsure the room is dimly lit, quiet, and thoroughly cleaned with continuous air filtration.\nPosition the von Frey mechanical testing rack and acrylic compartments with a light source below, providing illumination of the underside of the wire mesh.\nObtain clean, pre-bedded mouse cages for the social transfer procedure.\nNote: Each pair of mice (controls, demonstrator & bystander) will be placed into one of these cages for the duration of the social transfer. Thus, the number of clean cages required will correspond with the number of mouse pairs that will be tested.\nNote: Cages may optionally be modified to provide an open top (to allow for optogenetic tethers or video recording), or lids with filter tops can be used.",
    "Prepare a large table space to accommodate all of the cages for the social transfer procedure.\nNote: If mice are tethered during the social interaction and mechanical test, be sure to place the cages near the testing rack and provide a sufficient amount of slack in the tethers to aid transport between the chambers.\nArrange the clean, empty cages on the table, placing an opaque divider between them to prevent mice from observing animals in other cages. Pre-cut cardboard, acrylic segments, or vinyl adhesive on the cages are sufficient.\nPrepare fresh animal home cages (with food and water) for all mice to be housed in after the social transfer of pain.\nNote: All mice will be split into separate housing arrangements following the social transfer of pain, thus the number of home cages will double (see step 6 of this section and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). All mice should be placed in new, clean home cages to provide equivalent experiences for each new pair.\nTransport the mice to the behavioral testing room and habituate them in their home cages for 20 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2070-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative mechanical and thermal sensitivity data for the social transfer of pain assay\n(A) Following a 1 h social interaction with a CFA-injected mouse, bystander mice display significant reductions in mechanical thresholds lasting for at least 4 h, and recovering by 24 h. Data were collected by five experimenters at two institutions. Dashed line indicates the mean baseline score of all groups. Data are presented as mean mechanical thresholds (g) ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of each group at a given timepoint.",
    "(B) Representative thermal place test data immediately following a second social interaction one week after CFA injection. CFA and bystander mice spend less time on the warm floor compared to controls. Data were collected from two researchers at two institutions. Data points represent individual mice, with bars representing the group mean ± SEM for the % time spent on the warm floor.\n(C) Control mice demonstrate significantly decreased mechanical thresholds compared to baseline when they are tested on the rack at the same time as CFA and bystander mice (“Tested w/CFA, bystanders”). Dashed line represents the mean baseline score of all groups. Data points represent the mechanical thresholds (g) of individual mice, with bars representing the group mean ± SEM. Statistical tests include two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post hoc comparisons between control and bystander mice (A), one way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post hoc comparisons between control and bystander mice (B), and Paired t-test (C), ∗p < 0.05. ∗∗∗p < 0.001∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.\nInject CFA into the left hind paw of all CFA demonstrator mice:\nVortex the CFA bottle to resuspend Mycobacterium tuberculosis particles which may have precipitated on the bottom of the vial.\nLoad the Hamilton syringe with 10 μL CFA for each mouse, drawing up slowly and carefully to avoid introducing bubbles into the syringe.\nLightly restrain the mouse under one hand, and with the same hand, produce and restrain the left hind paw.\nInject 10 μL into the intraplantar surface of the paw using a Hamilton syringe (Knight et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Deuis et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Burek et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). This process should take <30 s per mouse.",
    "Note: Mice can be optionally anesthetized with isoflurane during the CFA injection to simplify the procedure. However, this protocol has been exclusively performed by injecting CFA in awake, lightly restrained animals to avoid the need for anesthesia.\nCritical: After CFA injection, the demonstrator and bystander mice must not interact outside of the designated social transfer period. Do not return the CFA mouse to the home cage with its respective bystander mouse. Following CFA injection, all CFA mice are to be housed separately from bystanders (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nImmediately following CFA injection, place the mouse into one of the clean, empty cages prepared in step 1e of this section. Keep track of which cage each mouse is being placed into, as their respective partner will be introduced in the next step.\nOnce all demonstrator mice have been injected with CFA and placed individually into cages, introduce their pre-assigned bystander partner to the corresponding cage. Allow the two mice to interact freely for 60 min.\nNote: Video recording, in vivo cell recordings or neural circuit manipulations (e.g., optogenetics or chemogenetics) can take place during this time to further examine behavior or manipulate/measure neuronal activity, respectively.\nFollowing the 1-h social interaction, split and separately house CFA and bystander mice originating from the same cage to prevent the continuous social transfer of pain in the home cage.\nNote: This will result in each original cage of 4 mice (containing two CFA mice and two bystander mice) being split into two cages (one containing two CFA demonstrator mice, and the other containing two bystander mice).\nNote: This procedure should also be applied to cages containing control mice (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Note: After the social transfer of pain procedure (described above), the same mice may be optionally exposed to another social transfer session—with the same partner mouse—at least one week later. If conducting a second social transfer, all procedures remain largely the same. However, immediately prior to the social transfer, CFA mice receive a needle “poke” to elicit active pain responses. To do this, restrain each CFA mouse and puncture the intraplantar surface of the treated hind paw with the 28-gauge hamilton syringe, or a 28-gauge needle, but do not inject any CFA. Following the poke, conduct the social transfer procedure as described above and perform additional behavioral tests.\nBegin nociceptive or other behavioral testing.\nNote: The following behavioral tests have been validated for this protocol: von Frey mechanical sensitivity, tail immersion, emotional discrimination, thermal place test, and elevated plus maze (Smith et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]) and a subset of these are described below.\nvon Frey - mechanical sensitivity test: Here we describe methods for the von Frey mechanical sensitivity test. For a more complete description, readers are encouraged to follow the protocol described in Chaplan et al. (1994)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nHabituation: On the 2 days prior to taking baseline measurements, habituate mice to the testing rack for 20 min. On the test day, allow mice to habituate to the testing rack for 5–20 min.\nBefore any treatment or social transfer, perform von Frey testing to establish baseline mechanical thresholds.\nNote: For our experiments, we use the Up-Down technique (Chaplan et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) which uses stimulus oscillation around the response threshold to determine the median 50% threshold of response.\nNote: It is acceptable to conduct baseline measurements immediately after the second habituation session (while the mice are still on the testing rack) or on the following day.",
    "The following evaluator sizes of von Frey hairs are to be used: 1.65, 2.44, 2.83, 3.22, 3.61, 3.84, 4.08, 4.31, 4.56. To begin testing, start with the 3.61 size von Frey hair (target force of 0.4 g). Place the hair perpendicular to the intraplantar surface of the left hindpaw and apply pressure until filament buckles, and hold in this position for 1–2 s.\nIf a response is observed, mark an ‘X’ on your score sheet and go “down,” testing with the next lowest filament (i.e., 3.22). A response is defined as withdrawal, shaking, splaying, lifting or licking of the paw. In contrast, if no response is observed, mark ‘O’ on your response sheet, and go “up,” testing with the next highest filament for the subsequent measurement (i.e., after starting at 3.61, go “up” to 3.84 if no response is observed).\nContinue this process until you reach 4 total tests after the first response is recorded (e.g., XOXXO). Record the filament evaluator size used on your final measurement next to your XO response (e.g., XOXXO - 2.44).\nCalculate the mechanical thresholds for each mouse using an open-source calculator (e.g., Gonzalez-Cano et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] or http://www.u.arizona.edu/∼michaelo/jflashdixon.html[href=http://www.u.arizona.edu/%7Emichaelo/jflashdixon.html]) or your own.\nTail immersion - thermal sensitivity test: Here we describe methods for the tail immersion test for thermal sensitivity. This test is not subject to locomotor confounds and measures a thermal reflexive nociceptive response. For considerations for the use of this test, readers are encouraged to read (Ramabadran et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]; Patel et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]).\nHabituation: on the 2 days prior to the first test session, lightly restrain mice in a cloth and dip the tip of their tail (∼5 cm from the end) into room temperature water for 5 s.",
    "On the test day, lightly restrain mice and submerge the tip of their tail into 46°C water. Use a stopwatch to determine latency of tail withdrawal response, which will appear as a rapid flick of the tail.\nWait 10 min, then repeat the procedure and average the two latencies for a single data point per mouse.\nEmotional Discrimination - affective state assay: Here we describe methods for the emotional discrimination test first described in Ferretti et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]. We have adapted the treatment conditions to include CFA mice, bystander mice, control mice, and an observer test mouse (unfamiliar with the CFA, bystander, and control mice). For a more complete description of the original protocol, (see Ferretti et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nHabituation: on the 3 days prior to testing, habituate naive observer mice (age- and sex-matched unfamiliar wild-type mice) to the testing apparatus by allowing them to explore the entire chamber (containing empty cups) for 10 min. Clean the chamber and all cups with warm water between each mouse. After the stranger mice have been habituated, clean the chamber and all cups with 70% ethanol. Next, habituate the mice that will become the CFA, bystander, and control mice by placing them under the cups in the chamber for 10 min. Clean the chamber and all cups with warm water between mice.\nOn the test day, conduct the social transfer procedure as described above. Immediately following the social transfer, place a control mouse under one of the two cups in the testing apparatus, and either a CFA or a bystander mouse in the other cup.\nNote: This will result in mice being placed under the cups in the following pairs: control and CFA, or control and bystander.\nIntroduce the previously habituated observer mouse into the chamber to explore freely for 6 min.",
    "Note: Use a camera positioned above the apparatus to record the stranger mouse’s exploration of the chamber.\nTo analyze the behavior, use a stopwatch to manually score the length of time the stranger mouse spent sniffing each cup (Ferretti et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nNote: Proximity to each cup is not sufficiently sensitive, and trained observers must specifically score sniffing behavior.\nThermal Place Test – affective state assay: Here we describe methods for the thermal place test as performed in Smith et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35].\nOn the test day, prepare a dual hot plate with one side of the plate set to room temperature (30°C), and the other side set to 40°C.\nAllow the mouse to freely explore the chamber for 10 min.\nDuring minutes 6–10, record the amount of time the mouse spends on the warm floor (40°C).\nNote: For minutes 1–5, the mouse will be acclimating to a new environment; therefore, this section of the trial is not scored.\nCompare the time spent on the warm floor during the final 5 min between control, CFA, and bystander mice with experimenter video analysis or automatic software analysis.\nNote: In the thermal place test, CFA mice do not display an aversion to the warm floor one-hour post-CFA injection, but do actively avoid the warm floor one week after CFA (Smith et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]). Alternative time courses have not been tested.",
    "Note: Whenever possible, the experimenter should be blind to treatment conditions. However, since CFA mice are easily identifiable by a swollen paw, and CFA / bystander mice need to be tested separately from controls, it is often challenging to effectively blind the experimenter to treatment conditions during behavioral testing. Experimenter bias may be mitigated via the following approaches: 1) for experiments involving multiple conditions/treatments (e.g., differing genotypes, drug injection, in-vivo neuronal/circuit manipulation) the experimenter should be blinded to those conditions. 2) We recommend the use of nociceptive measurements that can be scored via automated software or a blind experimenter and are thus less prone to experimenter bias (e.g., hot plate or thermal place test). 3) This protocol may be performed with other inflammatory agents such as capsaicin and formalin (Smith et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]) which do not induce such profound inflammation of the paw, and as such, can be substituted for CFA. However, we have only systematically tested the parameters for this protocol with CFA injection. NB: We have had several different experimenters (male and female) from various laboratories (across different institutions) replicate the social transfer of mechanical (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and thermal sensitivity (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B; Smith et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33], 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]; Walcott et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]). We have also observed the social transfer of pain in assays that do not require manual scoring (e.g., thermal place test). We are confident that the effects on von Frey are not due to experimenter bias, though every available precaution should be taken to ensure that you are cognizant of this potential confound.\nAdaptations\nTiming: 1.5 h",
    "The social transfer of pain protocol may optionally be adapted for the social transfer of analgesia. For this procedure, animals are assigned to one of three groups: CFA-control, CFA -analgesia, or CFA-bystander. Mice are then paired in the following 2 groups: 1) CFA-control and CFA-control as well as 2) CFA-analgesia and CFA-bystander (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Since this procedure is largely identical to the social transfer of pain protocol, please refer back to the social transfer of pain protocol wherever indicated in the steps below (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2070-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Timeline and representative data for the social transfer of analgesia\n(A) Protocol timeline; On 2 days prior to the social transfer, habituate all mice to the testing room and mechanical testing rack. On the second day of habituation, perform baseline mechanical threshold testing. 24 h later, habituate all mice to the testing room, and inject all mice with CFA, and analgesia mice with morphine immediately before the social transfer. Place paired mice together in a clean, unfamiliar cage for a one hour social interaction. Immediately following the social transfer, perform mechanical sensitivity and other behavioral testing. If conducting thermal place tests, repeat the experiment one week later, substituting a poke of the CFA paw immediately prior to the social interaction. This panel uses modified graphics from Biorender.com[href=http://Biorender.com].\n(B) Following a 1 h social interaction with a CFA-morphine injected (analgesia) mouse, CFA-bystander mice display significantly higher mechanical thresholds than CFA-control mice, lasting for at least 4 h, and recovering by 24 h. Data were collected by two experimenters at one institution. Dashed line indicates the mean baseline score of all groups. Data are presented as mean mechanical thresholds (g) ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of each group at a given timepoint.",
    "(C) Representative thermal place test data immediately following 1 h and 1 week post CFA injection. Dashed line represents 50% time on the warm floor. Data points represent the mechanical thresholds (g) of individual mice, with bars representing the group mean ± SEM.\n(D) Following a second social interaction one week after CFA injection, CFA-morphine Analgesia mice and CFA-Bystander mice spend more time on the warm floor compared to CFA-controls. Data were collected from two researchers at one institution. Data points represent individual mice, with bars representing the group mean ± SEM for the % time spent on the warm floor; Statistical tests include two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post hoc comparisons between control and bystander mice (B), and one way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post hoc comparisons between control and bystander mice (C), ∗p < 0.05. ∗∗∗p < 0.001∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.\nSocial Transfer of Analgesia.\nPrepare the testing room, as described in step 1 of the social transfer of pain[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section.\nHabituate all mice, as described in step 2 of the social transfer of pain[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section.\nInject 10 μL CFA into the left hind paw of all mice (CFA-control, CFA-analgesia, and CFA-bystander), as described in step 3 of the social transfer of pain[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section.\nImmediately after CFA injection, inject all CFA-analgesia mice with 10 mg/kg morphine (subcutaneous).\nNote: For control pairings, inject one CFA-control mouse from each pairing with subcutaneous saline. CFA-bystander mice do not receive an injection.",
    "Note: It is possible that other analgesic drugs may be substituted for morphine in the social transfer of analgesia procedure. However, this protocol has only been tested with (and is optimized for) the use of subcutaneously injected morphine as the analgesic agent. We have chosen subcutaneous injection as it has been previously demonstrated that morphine produces more robust analgesic effects when administered subcutaneously versus intraperitoneally (Bianchi and Franceschini, 1954[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Fennessy, 1968[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). However, intraperitoneal injection is also acceptable with an appropriately adjusted dose.\nImmediately following injection of morphine (analgesia) or saline (control), place the CFA-analgesia or CFA-control mouse individually into one of the empty cages prepared in step 1 of this section. Repeat for all mouse pairings, until each cage contains one mouse from each pairing.\nIntroduce the pre-assigned CFA-control or CFA-bystander mouse into the appropriate cage containing its partner and allow the mice to interact freely for 60 min.\nFollowing the 1-h social interaction, separate CFA-analgesia and CFA-bystander mice as described in step 6 of the social transfer of pain[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] section to prevent the continuous social transfer of analgesia.\nImmediately following the social transfer, begin nociceptive or other behavioral testing.\nNote: von Frey mechanical sensitivity and thermal place tests have both been validated for the social transfer of analgesia protocol (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C; Smith et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]).\nNote: As mentioned above, CFA injected mice do not avoid the warm floor 1 h after CFA injection (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B; Smith et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]), and we have only systematically used the thermal place test 1 week after CFA injection, following the second social transfer session.",
    "Note: Mice display robust hyperlocomotion while under the influence of morphine; thus, von Frey mechanical sensitivity measurements in morphine-injected mice are not possible. Locomotor changes are not evident in CFA-Bystander mice following the social transfer of analgesia (Smith et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35])."
