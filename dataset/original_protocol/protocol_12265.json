    "Procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the CAMH animal care committee and conducted in compliance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.\nNOTE: The handling method described herein can be used in various mouse strains, including non-transgenic (C57/BL6, BalbC, CD1, SV129, etc.) and transgenic lines. It can also be used with young or old mice, noting that young adult (4-6 weeks old) mice tend to be slightly more active than adult or old mice, especially on day 1.\n1. Experimental preparation\nPrior to study initiation, as per ARRIVE guidelines21, randomly assign mice to each handling group (3D-Handling, Tunnel Handling or Tail Handling).\nIdentify the room to perform the handling. It can be performed in the housing room, or in a separate room. If the handling is performed in a separate room, which requires the animals to be moved on a moving cart, allow the animals to habituate to the new room for 20-30 min prior to initiation of the handling protocol.\nFor group housed-animals, use a temporary cage to house mice after the handling, before regrouping them all in their initial home cage. This reduces potential fights between animals prior to handling (particularly in males).\nWork on a counter (preferably a cleared countertop) or in a biosafety cabinet, with the housing cage away from the animal being handled. Close proximity to the housing cage increases the risk of jumping. If animals are group-housed, jumping of the mouse being handled into the home cage may cause stress to cage-mates.\n\t​NOTE: Working in a biosafety cabinet limits the risk of mice jumping on the floor, and can be required in certain facilities. This technique can be used in a biosafety cabinet, making sure to always perform all steps inside the biosafety cabinet, and avoiding mice walking on handler forearms.",
    "2. DAY 1: 5 min per mouse\nGently open the cage and place the lid on the side, remove nesting materials, and other enrichment such as running wheels or shelters.\nIntroduce a gloved open hand to the home cage, slowly placing the hand along one side of the cage wall (the wall closest to the handler, Figure 1A).\n\t\nDo not immediately try to pick up the mouse.\nRemain immobile and allow the animal to habituate to the presence of the hand in the cage for about 30 s.\nAttempt to pick up the mouse in the palm of the hand (i.e., avoid picking up the animal by its tail).\n\t\nIf the mouse is not easily picked up after 3 attempts, guide the mouse to a corner and cup with both hands.\nGently move the cupped hands towards the mouse to try to pick it up.\nIf unsuccessful after a maximum of 3 attempts with both hands, pick up the mouse gently by the base of its tail, and transfer it to your forearm or flat hand.\nWith the mouse in the hand, keep the hand as flat and open as possible.\n\tNOTE: This provides a flat platform for the mouse to step onto, and limits the risk of bites.\nHolding the hand open and flat with palm up, place the other hand adjacent to the hand holding the mouse and allow the mouse to move freely from hand to hand without any restraint (Figure 1B).\nLet the mouse explore and move between hands for 1 min.\n\t\nAt this point mice may try to jump away. Position the hands such that if the mouse jumps, it will land on a countertop rather than the floor.",
    "If a mouse looks like it is preparing to jump (moving towards the edge of the hand and rearing on hind legs), slowly place the other hand in front of it and try to guide it into walking onto this hand. Avoid sudden movements as it increases their risk of jumping.\nIf a mouse does jump, attempt to pick it up avoiding tail handling and resume the handling session. If the mouse stays on the floor or out of the hands for more than 10 s, add additional time to the handling session to make up for any time the mouse was out of the hands.\nTake notes of the jump. Total number of jumps can be used to assess potential variability between animals.\nAfter 1 min of handling with flat hands, relax the palm of the hand, and slightly cup the mouse in the hand, prior to gently rolling the mouse between hands (Figure 1C).\n\t\nTo \"roll\", position the mouse in the palm of the hand, on a flat hand, perpendicular to fingers.\nSlowly close the hand, placing the fingers on the back of the mouse.\nPlace the free hand directly under the hand holding the mouse.\nSlowly turn/rotate the hand with the mouse to gently transfer the mouse to the other hand (180° flip).\nRepeat this back and forth between hands.\nAlternate from gentle rolling between hands and free exploration on open hands for 60 s, alternating between techniques about every 20 s.\nPerform a \"shelter test\" (Figure 1D).\n\t\nLet the mouse move to the edge of the hand then bring the 2 hands together.\nVery slowly, cup them so the mouse fits inside a \"shelter\" formed by the hands. Leave an opening so the mouse can escape if needed.",
    "Aim to keep the mouse in the shelter for 5-10 s, without any restraint.\nAlternate between the shelter test, roll between hands and free exploration of open hands for another 60 s, being sure to perform the shelter step 3 or more times.\nIn all procedures described in 2.10, do not rush the process. If the mouse appears stressed (i.e., tentative to escape, jumps from the hands, avoiding contact with hands etc.) by being confined inside the hands, continue with rolling between hands and free exploration for 20 s, and then retry.\nMilestone: Perform at least 1 successful shelter test of 10 s for completion of Day 1.\n\t\nConsider a shelter test successful when the mouse stays in the hands. If the mouse pops its head out and returns to the shelter, it is still a successful test. If the animal entirely exits from the shelter, it is a failure.\nAllow free exploration in hands for 30 s.\nGently replace the mouse in its cage. If group housed, place the mouse in the temporary cage until all cage mates are handled. Return the mice to their original cage by picking them up in the palm of the hand. Do not use a tail pick up.\nClean the bench top of potential feces and urine with 70% ethanol.\nRinse gloves thoroughly with 70% ethanol (or appropriate cleaning solution) or change gloves prior to handling the next mouse (it is possible to keep the same gloves for cage mates).",
    "​NOTE: It is recommended to perform the handling with a reasonable number of animals to avoid fatigue from the handler. Handling 24 mice takes around 2 h and it is recommended to not exceed 24 mice per handler. If more animals need to be handled, it is recommended either to have multiple handlers, or to split the handling procedures into subgroups, over multiple days.\n3. DAY 2: 3 to 5 min per mouse\nAttempt to pick up the mouse in the palm of the hand. At this stage, it should be already feasible and mice should not jump out of the hand.\nStart with palm open as on Day 1, allowing the mouse to explore freely for 20 s.\nThen, roll the mouse between hands a few times (4-5 times).\nPerform the \"shelter test\" for 5 s.\nRepeat the shelter test several times (~5-6) over a 2 to 3 min period.\nDuring the same 2 to 3 min period, alternate with the roll between hands and free exploration of open hands step from day 1 to improve habituation.\n\t\nTouch the mouse on its head and back (Figure 1E), 5-6 times. A sign of habituation is when the mouse lets you touch it without attempting to escape.\nPerform a \"Nose poke\": Try to touch the snout of the mouse, 2 to 3 times (Figure 1F).\n\t\t\nIf the mouse attempts to bite or shows obvious signs of stress at being touched, do not immediately attempt the nose poke again. Instead, alternate with flat hand exploration and roll. \"Habituation\" is reflected by the animal not running away or turning its head in cases of human contact.",
    "In all procedures described in 3.4-3.6, do not rush the process. If the mouse appears stressed by being confined inside the hands or does not want to be touched, continue with rolling between hands for 20-30 s and then retry.\nMilestones: Perform at least 1 successful nose poke for 2-3 s for completion of Day 2.\nStop this session after about 3 min of handling if the animal reacts well to the \"shelter\", \"head petting\", \"nose poke\", and if the mouse appears to be willing to explore the hands without signs of stress.\nIf the mouse continues to exhibit signs of stress or is not reacting well to the \"shelter test\" or \"nose poke\" test, continue the session until reaching 5 min as in Day 1.\nReplace the mouse in its cage, clean the bench top and gloves as in Day 1.\n4. DAY 3: Around 3 min per mouse\nOn the third day, proceed through the same steps as in Day 2, for 2 to 3 min.\n\t\nPick up the mouse in the palm of the hand.\nTransfer and roll the mouse between hands\nPerform a shelter test.\nTry to pet the mouse on the back and head.\nAlternate between these steps over approximately 1 to 2 min.\nContinue the procedure until the mouse is relaxed enough to sit in the palm of the hand without attempting to escape.\nBefore the end of Day 3, repeat the shelter test and nose poke test as a test of habituation.\n\t\nIf both tests can be completed on their first attempt, the habituation process is complete. Continue gently handling the mouse for 30 s to a minute.\nIf the mouse is initially resistant to either test, repeat steps 4.1-4.3 for 20-30 s before reattempting the nose poke and shelter test.",
    "If the mouse remains resistant to these tests after 3 min, the third day may be repeated.\nMilestones: Perform at least 2 successful shelter tests of 10 s each, and 2 successful nose poke test for completion of Day 3, and completion of the entire 3D-handling procedure.\nReturn the mouse to its cage, clean the bench top and gloves.\n5. Optional approach for animals to be subjected to restraint for injection or gavage\nNOTE: On Day 3, if the animal will be restrained for experimental purposes (oral gavage, intra-peritoneal injection, etc.), the mice can be subjected to the neck pinch test.\nGrasp the nape of the neck between the thumb and forefinger (Figure 1G).\nLift the mouse 3-5 cm above the hand for 2-3 s.\n\tNOTE: This is normally a non-natural position for adult mice, and if the mice remain near immobile, they are well habituated to handling and will be easy to restrain for experimental purposes.\nPlace the mouse back on in the flat hand, or if the mouse is reactive to the neck pinch, consider placing it on the experimenter's sleeve, cage lid or countertop\n\tNOTE: If working in a biosafety cabinet, do not place the mouse on the sleeve or it could walk up and exit the biosafety cabinet. Prefer placing the mouse on the countertop inside the biosafety cabinet.\nLeave the mouse to freely explore the experimenter's hand for 1 min.\n6. Optional approach for additional days of handling\nIn the eventuality of a highly stressed mouse line, add additional days to decrease the reactivity and stress level of the animals, using the methods described in Day 2/3.",
    "​NOTE: Many factors can affect baseline stress of the animals including strain, presence of transgenic modification, age, sex and housing conditions. If these factors are not consistent between groups such as aged animals being tested against young controls or transgenic animals being tested against wild type controls, it is recommended that the same number of days of habituation are used for each group.\n7. Tunnel handling\nNOTE: This technique is applicable only to the Tunnel-handled mice. Tunnels are polycarbonate tubes approximately 13 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter.\nPlace the tunnel in the cage of the mouse.\nLeave the tunnel in the cage for 7 days prior to handling.\nOpen the cage and place the lid on the side.\nGently guide the mouse into the polycarbonate tunnel (already in the cage).\nLift the tunnel from the cage, horizontally. If necessary loosely cover the ends of the tunnel to prevent the animal from jumping/falling out of the tunnel, potentially falling back in its cage or on the floor.\nMove the animal in the tunnel away from the home cage and hold it away from any surfaces for 30 s.\nPlace the tunnel back in the home cage, allowing the mouse to exit the tube.\nWait for 60 s and then repeat steps 7.4-7.7 once.\nRinse gloves thoroughly with 70% ethanol or change gloves prior to habituating the next mouse.\nRepeat this procedure for 10 consecutive days.\n8. Tail handling\nNOTE: This technique is applicable only to the Tail-handled mice. It is used to transfer mice from their cage to an apparatus, and vice-versa.\nOpen the cage and place the lid on the side.\nGrasp the mice by the base of the tail between thumb and forefinger.\nLift the mouse from the cage.",
    "In 2-3 s, transfer mouse to the experimenter's opposite forearm while maintaining a grip on the tail to avoid the mouse dangling.\nWhen tail handling is required in the implementation of this experiment (e.g., before blood draws for cortisol testing) animals are transferred to the experimenter's forearm by tail handling and held for 15 s before being returned to their cage.\n9. Elevated Plus Maze\nRoom setup\n\t\nPlace the maze in the middle of the room, under a digital camera equipped with a memory card.\nSet up the light of the room at ~60 Lux using 2 standing lamps placed behind the maze.\nTurn off any overhead lighting to avoid direct light on the maze that creates reflection and disrupts the detection of the animals in the maze.\nOnce all the equipment is set up, transfer the animals to the room and let them acclimatize to the light settings and the new environment for 30 minutes.\nTesting\n\t\nClean the maze with 70% ethanol to prevent smells from dust or from the animal that was tested previously.\nStart the camera.\nUse a piece of paper with the animal ID to record the ID on the video, prior to placing the animal in the maze (this will facilitate the proper identification of which mouse is being filmed on each video).\nUse the appropriate handling technique to each animal to transfer it to the maze.\nPlace the mouse on the central platform, facing an open arm.\nAllow the mouse to explore the apparatus for 10 min, undisturbed.\nAfter 10 minutes, stop the camera.\nRetrieve the mouse from the maze and put it back in its cage.\nClean feces and urine from the maze with 70% ethanol.",
    "Once testing is complete with all mice, transfer videos from the memory card to a computer for video tracking.\nUsing automated animal tracking software, track the number of entries to the open and closed arms, and the time spent in open or closed arms (here Ethovision XT 14).\n10. Experimenter Interaction (derived from Hurst and West9)\nRoom setup\n\t\nPlace a table in the middle of the testing room under a digital camera equipped with a memory card.\nSet up the light at 50-70 Lux with 4 light bulbs placed in the corner of the room facing up to the ceiling. Turn off overhead lighting to avoid direct light on the maze that creates reflection and disrupt the detection of the animals in the arena.\nBring the animals to the room.\nLet them acclimatize to the room for 30 minutes.\nExperiment\n\t\nPlace the home cage under the digital camera.\nRemove the lid.\nRemove nesting material and other enrichment that might interfere with tracking of animals.\nStart the camera.\nUse the cage card with the animal ID to identify the animal on the video.\nPlace a hand in the home cage along the wall of the cage in the front right side.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the handler's head is not blocking the camera to film the mouse.\nStart a timer.\nKeep the hand immobile for 2 minutes, and let the mouse explore the hand.\nRemove the hand from the cage for 15 s.\nAttempt to pick up the mouse using cupped hands and record whether the mouse flees.\nRepeat the last step up to five times, every 5 seconds, or until the mouse allows itself to be picked up.\nRecord the number of attempts required to pick up the mouse.\nReturn nesting material and enrichment to the cage.",
    "Clean gloves with 70% ethanol or change gloves before proceeding to the next animal.\nAfter testing, transfer videos from the memory card to a computer.\nUsing automated video tracking software, divide the cage into four equal quadrants and record the time spent by the mouse in each quadrant (here, Ethovision XT 14).\n11. Novelty Suppressed Feeding\nFood deprivation\n\t\n3 days prior to the test, perform a full cage change, and single house the animals (single housing is preferable to perform the home cage testing).\n\t\tNOTE: Providing fresh bedding removes potential dust or little pieces of food accumulating in the bedding since last cage change.\nThe day before testing, weigh all animals around 6 pm.\nRemove all food from the food hopper, and ensure that there are no pieces of food in the cage or in the bedding.\nRoom setup\n\t\nPlace the NSF chamber on a table.\nFill the chamber with a thin layer of corn bedding (or other bedding that is different from bedding used in animals home cage).\nSet up the light at 70 Lux with 4 light bulbs placed in the corner of the table where the chamber stands, facing up to the ceiling. Turn off overhead lights to maintain low room lighting.\nPlace one pellet of standard chow used in the facility, on the side of the chamber facing the experimenter (≈10 cm from the wall).\nTesting\n\t\nIn the morning after food deprivation, bring the animals to the room 30 minutes prior to testing to let them acclimatize to the light settings and the new environment.\nWeigh all animals in order to measure their weight loss based on the weight measured the previous day. Animals should lose 8-12% overnight to be able to perform the task properly.",
    "Sort the animals per weight loss, and screen them starting from the mouse that lost the most to the mouse that lost the least weight.\nEnsure that the chamber is filled with bedding and with a single pellet.\nPlace the animal on the opposite side of the chamber, away from the food pellet.\nStart the timer immediately.\nLet the mouse explore the chamber for up to 12 minutes.\nMeasure the latency to approach and feed (animal must bite and eat) on the food pellet.\n\t\t\nConsider it to be an approach when the animal comes close to the pellet, smells it and does not bite.\nDefine a bite as when the animal starts consuming the pellet.\nRecord the latency to approach and feed on the pellet in seconds.\nOnce the mouse has fed on the food pellet, remove the mouse from the chamber.\nDiscard the bedding but save the pellet that will be used for testing appetite drive in the mouse home cage.\nReset the chamber for the next animal and proceed with the next animal.\n15 min after completion of the test in the chamber, drop the pellet used during the test, inside the home cage of the mouse, against the wall at the front of the cage.\nMeasure the latency to feed on the pellet when the pellet is in the home cage. This is a measure for appetite drive.\n\t\t\nIt is preferable to remove the nesting material to ensure that the mouse sees the pellet being dropped in its cage.\n12. Serum Collection and Corticosterone Measurement\nHandle animals for 1 min using the assigned technique, 15 min prior to blood collection (this can be done with group housed or single housed animals, keeping in mind the risk for fights when regrouping mice).",
    "For the tunnel handled mice, guide them to the tunnel, lift the tunnel from the cage for 1 min, and replace the mouse in its cage.\nFor tail handled mice, grab the tail base of the mouse and remove the mouse from its cage. Transfer the mouse to the experimenters sleeve for 1 min, and return the mouse to its cage by tail handling.\nFor 3D-handled mice, use cupped hands to remove the mouse from its cage. Hold the mouse in cupped hands for 1 min, and return it to its cage.\n15 min after handling, proceed with blood collection from the submandibular vein22.\nFirmly scruff the mouse such that the head of the mouse is securely immobilized.\nLocate the site of puncture.\n\t\nThere is a small hairless dimple along the mandible of the face that can be used as a landmark to locate the puncture site. Drawing a line between the base of the jaw and this dimple the puncture site lies behind this dimple towards the ear by roughly 5 mm, just behind the hinge of the jaw.\nHold a clean 23 G needle perpendicular to the puncture site and use a quick firm lancing motion. The tip of the needle should penetrate to a depth between 1-2 mm, blood will flow immediately as soon as the vein is punctured.\nCollect ~150 µL of blood in EDTA coated collection tubes and store on ice.\nApply slight pressure with a sterile gauze pad to the puncture site for 5 s or more to allow the blood to clot.\nOnce blood has clotted, return the mouse to its home cage.\nCentrifuge blood at 4 °C 3,500 x g for 10 min.\nDecant the supernatant.\nStore the supernatant at -20 °C for downstream analyses.",
