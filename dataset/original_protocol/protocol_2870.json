    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLoading neurons\nTiming: 45 min\nOptional: For better identification of\n      cells, neurons may be loaded with fluorescent dyes. Calcein AM was chosen\n      in this protocol to identify the cells' cytoplasm and thereby their\n      morphologies.\n    \n        Staining neurons with fluorescent dyes\n        \n            Dilute 5 mM calcein AM stock to a final working concentration of\n            100 nM in HEPES ACSF.\n          \n            Load cells with 100 nM calcein AM in HEPES ACSF for 30 min at 37°C\n            in 5% CO2 incubator.\n          \n            After loading, wash cells in fresh HEPES ACSF and transfer to 35 mm\n            glass base dish (IWAKI) with 3 mL of HEPES ACSF.\n          \nCritical: Calcein AM is sensitive to\n      hydrolysis. Calcein AM-containing aqueous working solutions should be made\n      shortly before use and used within one day.\n    \nCritical: The concentration of calcein\n      AM and the incubation time are strictly controlled since relatively high\n      concentrations of calcein AM can be toxic to cells, especially neurons;\n      low concentrations of calcein AM can also lead to difficulties in\n      observation.\n    \n        Check cells with conventional microscope\n        \n            After staining is complete, use fluorescence microscope to assess\n            staining of neurons.\n          \nNote: Wait 15–60 minutes to allow for AM\n      ester removal if fluorescence color presentation is insufficient for cell\n      identification.\n    \nObservation of propofol in living neurons\nTiming: 1 h\n        Detection of propofol-d17 signal\n        \n            Align the two lasers to maximize the SRS signals using\n            alkyne-containing standard sample (alkyne-estrogen).\n          \n            Just before imaging, add propofol-d17 to the cell culture dish to\n            make a final concentration of 100 μM.\n          \n            Place the dish on the sample stage and prepare for observation.\n            \nOptional: If the system is\n              equipped with single photon confocal microscopy, turn it on,\n              illuminate cells with 488 nm laser, locate the cells with the\n              fluorescence of calcein AM.\n            \n            After checking the safety of the optical line, open a shutter for",
    "pump and Stokes lasers, run program to start the experiment.\n          \n            Referring to the two-photon microscope channel, adjust the bottom\n            objective lens to position the cell again.\n          \nCheck the signal of the SRS channel.\n            If the objective lens is equipped with correction collar, adjust it\n            to maximize the SRS signal.\n            \nNote: Although SRS signals do not\n              bleach, fluorescence signals may be susceptible to bleaching with\n              high intensity lasers used for SRS imaging.\n            \n            Adjust the number of frame and average according to the strength of\n            the signal and acquire the image (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2579-Fig5.jpg\n                  Figure 5. Representative images of multimodal multiphoton\n                  imaging of primary cultured neurons\n                \n                  SRS signals of propofol-d17 at 2055 cm−1 (A) and\n                  two-photon excited fluorescence of calcein AM (B) can be\n                  acquired simultaneously.\n                \nNote: Frame averaging result in\n              acquisition of images with better signal to noise ratio but\n              reduces temporal resolution.\n            \n        Confirmation of the signal of propofol-d17\n        \n            Set the pump wavelength to make the wavenumber below\n            2,000 cm−1, off-resonance wavenumber of propofol-d17.\n          \nObtain the image in the same frame averaging setting.\n            Compare images under on- and off-resonance pulses to confirm the\n            signal of propofol-d17.\n          \nData analysis\n      Fiji was used to analyze the intensity distribution of the SRS signals,\n      which can further confirm the location of propofol-d17 on neuron.\n    \nMeasuring dynamics of propofol by washout experiment\nTiming: 3 h (for steps 6 and 7)\n    \n      High sensitivity and low toxicity of multimodal multiphoton system allows\n      characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of propofol. For this\n      purpose, a perfusion system was used to wash away propofol-d17 on the\n      neuronal culture while monitoring SRS signals.\n    \n        Washout experiments\n        \n            Using the loaded neuronal cells described above, choose a target\n            cell for timelapse imaging.\n          \n            Perform a timelapse imaging for a total 1,000 frames while perfusing\n            of 3 mL 100 μM propofol-d17 solution with fresh HEPES ACSF solution",

SRS image before (left) and after (right) exchange\n                  of propofol-d17 with fresh HEPES ACSF on hippocampal neuron\n                \n                  Reduction in the SRS signal intensity of propofol-d17 at\n                  2055 cm−1 at somatic regions (blue and red boxes)\n                  after washout can be seen.\n                \nOptional: Use ImageJ (Fiji) to process\n      the data, make a composite image, and group every 20 images to get a\n      time-lapse image set and perform mathematical analysis.\n    \nOptional: Alternatively, a set of 1000\n      frames can be obtained during the washout of 3 mL 100 μM propofol-d17 with\n      fresh 100 μM of regular (non-deuterated) propofol on the same kind of\n      neuronal cells.\n    \n        Data Analysis\n        \nNote: The microscope system can\n          acquire data from four channels at the same time as photodetectors can\n          be equipped with a bandpass filter to detect various signals. In this\n          experiment, two main signal channels are used i.e., SRS signal and\n          two-photon excited fluorescence signal are acquired simultaneously, in\n          which the two-photon excited fluorescence image is used as a guide to\n          identify the location of cells.\n        \n            Choose the region of interest for analysis (cell body in the example\n            shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\n            \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2579-Fig7.jpg\n                  Figure 7.
