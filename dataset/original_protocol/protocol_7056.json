    "Nuclear extract:Note: All nuclear isolation steps and solutions should be kept on ice.Inoculate 250 ml of liquid glucose minimal medium (GMM) to a final concentration of 1 x 106 spores/ml and incubate at 37 °C, 250 rpm for 48 h.Collect mycelia by vacuum filtration through two layers of miracloth. Remove excess moisture by squeezing in between paper towels. Place mycelia into a 15 ml Falcon tube and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen. After freezing, grind mycelia to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Transfer ~5 g ground mycelia to 50 ml Falcon tubes.Add 40 ml of ice cold Nuclear Isolation buffer and vortex to mix. Centrifuge for 10 min at 1,000 x g, 4 °C. Filter supernatant through a double layer of miracloth into 30 ml centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge for 10,000 x g for 15 min, 4 °C. Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 ml of ice cold Resuspension buffer.Centrifuge for 10,000 x g for 15 min, 4 °C. Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold ST buffer.Transfer suspension into 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and pellet debris by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 30 sec, room temperature.Transfer supernatant into a sterile 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Store at -20 °C if desired.Quantify protein levels using Bio-Rad Protein Assay or equivalent. Western blotting:Load standardized amount of protein per sample (e.g. 50 μg) onto an SDS-PAGE gel with appropriate sample loading buffer (such as Laemmli 2x sample buffer).I used 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE, cast according to Schägger (2006), and the Bio-Rad Mini Protean gel electrophoresis system.Transfer to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting using the Bio-Rad Semi-Dry Blotter (can be done at room temperature).",
    "Soak your gel in western transfer buffer for 30 min and soak the nitrocellulose membrane in western transfer buffer for 10 min before blotting.Soak extra thick blotting paper in western transfer buffer–construct the “sandwich” according to the semi-dry transfer manual. From the bottom (+ pole) working to the top (- pole): Extra thick blotting paper, nitrocellulose membrane, acrylamide gel, extra thick blotting paper.Assemble apparatus and run at 15 V for 1 h.Block membranes for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T. Incubate with primary antibodies for 1 h in TBS-T. 10 ml is sufficient for a small blot. Incubation may also be performed at 4 °C, especially if planning to reuse primary antibody solutions. Pour off the primary antibody solutions. Primary antibody solutions may be reused up to 5 times, although antibody concentration will decrease with each use. (note: These solutions contain sodium azide as preservative).Wash 3 x 10 min in TBS-T. Apply secondary antibodies in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. 10 ml is sufficient for a small blot.Pour off secondary antibody solution (no need to retain). Wash blots 3 x 10 min in TBS-T at room temperature on the orbital shaker.Add One-step NBP/BCIP developing solution and agitate gently. Keep an eye on the signal intensity, it will only be a matter of minutes to develop and development time will be different for each antibody. When reaches desired intensity (or just before), pour off the developing solution and rinse in several changes of distilled water. Incubate in ddH2O for ~20 min.(Note: NBP/BCIP developer results precipitation of a colored substance on the membrane, thus, membranes cannot be stripped and reprobed. If intending to reprobe the membrane, alternative secondary antibodies (e.g. HRP or fluorescent conjugated) should be used.",
    ")Blots can be dried on bench to preserve. Signal will fade upon direct exposure to light."
