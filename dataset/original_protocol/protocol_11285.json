    "1. 3D spheroids as an in vitro model for fibroblast/CAF differentiation using different TGF-β1 inhibiting compounds of cell-matrix interaction\nMix 1 part of 6 mg/mL methylcellulose solution and 3 parts of cell culture media, MEM supplemented with 1% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to obtain the spheroid formation solution.\nResuspend freshly thawed immortalized normal fibroblasts (iNFs), immortalized CAF (iCAFs) or integrin α3β1 KO iCAF (passage up to 25) in the spheroid formation solution. If preparing one 96 well plate, prepare an excess of spheroid formation solution, 10 mL and add 75,000 cells, keeping in mind that each spheroid is composed by 750 cells, and that 100 µL are distributed per each well of the plate.\nIf cytokines or integrin inhibitors are included in the study, add these compounds to the cell suspension, in order to embed them into the spheroids during their formation. Note that iNFs are stimulated with 10 ng/mL of TGF-β1 in order to trigger differentiation. Where appropriate, add inhibitor compounds together with TGF-β1, such as 20 µg/mL BM2 or 10 µg/mL of lebein 1.\nPrepare CAF homospheroids in the same way but without the TGF-β1 stimulus, since they are already differentiated. Prepare the integrin α3 KO CAF homospheroids without the addition of any compound.\nDistribute the spheroid formation solution onto a round bottom 96 multi-well plate by adding 100 µL of the solution in each well. Every time the spheroid solution is distributed in the wells, mix well by pipetting up and down, several times.\nPlace the plate in the cell culture incubator for 24 h to allow one spheroid to be formed in each well.",
    "Collect the spheroids after about 24 h and use them for different downstream purposes: immunofluorescent staining, real time (RT) q-PCR and flow cytometry. To detect expression of intra- and extracellular antigens, including deposition of ECM proteins within the spheroid, use immunofluorescent staining. After disintegration of spheroids into single cells, quantify membrane-anchored receptor by flow cytometry. To detect gene activation and transcriptional changes, use RT q-PCR of mRNA isolated from the spheroid cells.\n2. Immunofluorescent staining of spheroids\nCollect the spheroids after about 24 h into one 1.5 mL reaction tube per experimental condition or per protein to be analyzed. For example, place the spheroids of iNFs stimulated with TGF-β1 in a tube different from the control iNFs, which were not treated. To avoid rupture of spheroids due to too strong shear forces, cut the end of the pipette tip to enlarge the orifice. Include at least 5-10 spheroids in one reaction tube, to allow replicates and take into account the possible losses during the washing steps.\nCentrifuge the spheroids with a bench top centrifuge for about 30-60 s at 1,000 x g. Carefully remove the methylcellulose-containing supernatant by pipetting, without disturbing the pelleted spheroids.\nWash with 50 µL of 1x PBS. Repeat the centrifugation step and carefully remove the PBS by pipetting, as described in 2.2.\nDepending on the protein to be stained, fix with 50 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature (for αSMA, NG2 and integrin α3β1) or with 50 µL of methanol for 10 min at -20 °C (for laminin-332 subunits).\nRepeat the washing step as explained in steps 2.2-2.3.\nPermeabilize the cells with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 4 min at room temperature.\nRepeat the washing step as explained in steps 2.2-2.3 three times.",
    "Incubate the spheroids in PBS containing 5% FBS and 2% BSA, for 1 h at RT to block non-specific protein interaction sites.\nIncubate the spheroids with 30 µL of primary antibodies in PBS, 2.5% FBS and 1% BSA at 4 °C overnight. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-αSMA Cy-3 conjugated and anti-NG2 at 5 µg/mL; BM2 anti-laminin α3, 6F12 anti-laminin β3 and anti-laminin γ2 20 µg/mL.\nRepeat the washing step as explained in steps 2.2-2.3 three times.\nIncubate the spheroids with 30 µL of secondary antibodies in PBS, 2.5% FBS and 1% BSA at RT for 90 min. The following secondary antibodies used were: Alexa 488 anti-rabbit and anti-mouse (5 µg/mL).\nRepeat the washing step as explained in steps 2.2-2.3 three times.\nIncubate the cells with 30 µL of DAPI staining solution for 4 min at room temperature.\nRepeat the washing step as explained in steps 2.2-2.3.\nPlace the spheroids on a glass slide, in a drop of PBS, using a glass Pasteur pipet.\nImage the spheroids by fluorescence microscopy in a laser scanning microscope using a magnification of 10x. Take different optical cross-section of the spheroid at different optical planes of a z-stack (15-20 stack planes). To establish the laser settings in the microscope, use a spheroid composed of cells negative for the antigen of interest or a spheroid stained only with the secondary antibody. Reuse the same settings for all the samples that will be compared.\nAnalyze the microscopic images with ImageJ software as published previously14. The steps are summarized in Supplemental Figure 1. As background, determine the integrated signal density of a cell-free region of interest (ROI). Calculate the total corrected cell fluorescence (TCCF) as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60122/60122eq1.jpg",
    "Determine the total corrected fluorescence (TCF) of the spheroids as the TCCF normalized to the area of spheroid and the number of stacks.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60122/60122eq2.jpg\n3. RT q-PCR of homospheroids\nTo perform RT-qPCR, collect at least 288 spheroids (corresponding to three 96-well plates) into a 50 mL reaction tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g and carefully remove the methylcellulose-containing supernatant by pipetting without disturbing the pelleted spheroids.\nWash with 1 mL of 1x PBS and transfer the spheroids to a 1.5 mL reaction tube. Centrifuge the spheroids with a bench top centrifuge for about 30-60 s at 1,000 x g. Carefully remove the PBS by pipetting, without disturbing the pelleted spheroids.\nDissociate the spheroids with 250 µL of 4 mg/mL collagenase B, 50 µg/mL DNase I, 2% BSA, 1 mM CaCl2 in PBS at 37 °C for about 30-45 min by gently vortexing and pulsing intermittently for a few seconds every 5 min.\nRepeat the washing step as explained in step 3.2.\nIsolate the total RNA from the cells of disintegrated spheroids using a commercial RNA isolation kit, according to the manufacturers’ instructions.\nReverse transcribe the isolated mRNA into cDNA with a commercial kit, according to manufacturers’ instructions.\nQuantify the transcription levels in replicates by real-time PCR. The primers used were: α-SMA: Fw 5′-CCGACCGAATGCAGAAG GA-3′, Rev 5′ ACAGAGTATTTGCGCTCCGAA-3′15; Laminin α3 chain: Fw 5′-GCTCAGCTGTTTGTGGTTGA-3′, Rev 5′-TGTCTGCATCTGCCAATAGC-3′16; Laminin β3 chain: Fw 5′-GGCAGATGATTAGGGCAGCCGAGGAA-3′ Rev 5′-CGGACCTGCTGGATTAGGAGCCGTGT-3′17; Laminin γ2 chain: Fw 5′-GATGGCATTCACTGCGAGAAG-3′ Rev 5′-TCGAGCACTAAGAGAACCTTTGG-3′ 16; NG2: Fw 5′-CTGCAGGTCTATGTCGGTCA-3′ Rev 5′-TTGGCTTTGACCCTGACTATG-3′18; integrin α3 subunit: Fw 5’-AGGGGACCTTCAGGTGCA-3’ Rev 5’-TGTAGCCGGTGATTTACCAT-3’19; TOP-1: Fw 5′-CCAGACGGAAGCTCGGAAAC-3′ Rev 5′-GTCCAGGAGGCTCTATCTTGAA-3′20.\nCorrect the Ct values for the Ct-value of an endogenous reference gene such as TOP-1 using the equation: 2- ΔΔCt. ΔΔCt = ΔCt (target sample) – ΔCt (reference sample) and ΔCt= Ct of target gene or reference gene – TOP-I.",
    "4. Flow cytometry analysis of integrin expression\nFor flow cytometric analysis, collect at least 288 spheroids (corresponding to three 96-well plates) into a 50 mL reaction tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g and carefully remove the methylcellulose-containing supernatant by pipetting.\nWash with 1 mL of 1x PBS and transfer the spheroids to a 1.5 mL reaction tube. Repeat the centrifugation step and carefully remove the PBS by pipetting.\nDissociate the spheroids as described in step 3.3.\nRepeat the washing step as explained in step 4.2.\nTo block non-specific binding sites and to prevent binding of detection-relevant antibodies to Fcγ-receptors (CD16, CD32, and CD64), incubate the cells in 100 µL of PBS containing 2% horse serum (or serum of another animal species, the antibodies of which will not be used in the experiment) and 0.1% BSA for 20 min at 4 °C with rotation.\nIn case of staining intracellular markers, fix/permeabilize the cells as described under step 2.2-2.5.\nIncubate the cells with the primary antibodies in 100 µL of PBS containing 2% horse serum and 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. Dilute the primary antibody to 10 µg/mL.\nWash with 100 µL of PBS + 0.1% BSA three times, with centrifugation steps in the top bench centrifuge at 1,000 x g in between.\nIncubate the cells with the secondary antibodies in 100 µL of PBS containing 2% horse serum and 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. Dilute secondary antibody to 10 µg/mL.\nRepeat the washing step as explained in step 4.7.\nAnalyze 2.0 x 104 stained cells in a flow cytometer. Gate for single live cells via the FSC-SSC dot plot and analyze the fluorescence of the gated cells on the channel appropriate for the selected fluorophore.",
    "5. Invasion assay using heterospheroids\nPrepare the spheroid formation solution for heterospheroids, containing the different cell types and corresponding mediums, as summarized in Table 1. The cells had previously been transduced with lentivirus containing vectors for either mCherry or GFP expression.\nFill 100 µL of the spheroid formation solution in each well of the plate and incubate the plate in the cell culture incubator for 24 h to allow one spheroid to be formed in each well.\nPrepare 60 µL of gelatinous matrix mixture containing 2 mg/mL of rat tail collagen I, 30% of commercial gelifying matrix and 2.5 µg/mL of laminin-332 in a 1.5 mL reaction tube. Rapidly distribute 15 µL in 3 wells of the µ-slide angiogenesis chamber. Embed one spheroid in each well already containing the gel.\nIf necessary, rapidly adjust the location of the spheroid to the center of the well with a pipette under the microscope.\nRepeat steps 5.2-5.3 for the next heterospheroids and repeat again for the homospheroids.\nIncubate the gels in the incubator for 1 h to solidify and, then, gently overlay the gels with cell culture medium.\nImage the spheroids by fluorescence microscopy in a laser scanning microscope. Take different optical cross-section of the spheroid at different optical planes of a z-stack and at different time points of invasion (e.g., 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h).\nAnalyze the images by counting the number of invading cancer cells. Invading cells are those ones that have left the spheroid and entered the invasive area. The invasive area is defined as the ring area between the outer and inner perimeters given by the furthest invaded cell and by the spheroid border of the spheroid at the beginning of the invasion experiments, respectively, as outlined in Supplemental Figure 2.",
