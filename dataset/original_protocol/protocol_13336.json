    "The ethical committee of the Laboratory Animal Research Center of Chonnam National University Hospital (approval no. CNU IACUC - H - 2022-36) approved all the animal experiments. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-450 g), used in this study received care in compliance with the guidelines for the care and use of the laboratory animals. The rats were housed in temperature-controlled rooms with a 12 h light-dark cycle, with standard food and water available.\n1. Preparation\nNOTE: A single experimenter can conduct all experimental procedures.\nAssemble the Langendorff apparatus, including the oxygenator, pump, and perfusion lines, prior to surgery (Figure 2). Fill the perfusion circuit with 20 mL of saline solution and circulate it until it is primed with autologous blood.\n\tNOTE: The objective of this step is to warm the extracorporeal circuit.\nAttach the cardioplegic line to the circuit via the stopcock attached to the aortic cannula and prepare the syringe pump for the final cardioplegic infusion.\n\tNOTE: Ensure the removal of any air bubbles from the perfusion circuit and the cardioplegic line.\nPlace the temperature sensor within the reservoir where the donor heart will be stored, maintaining the circuit's temperature at 37 °C.\nSurgical preparations\n\t\nPrepare a separate set of sterile micro-instruments and materials for each donor and recipient rat.\n\t\t\nPrepare the surgical set for the donor: pair of surgical scissors, pair of micro forceps, sharp mosquito forceps, 5-0 silk sutures, cotton swabs, 50 mL syringe, perfusion line for the cardioplegic solution (CPS), syringe pump, 18 G angiocatheter, one set of 5 Fr. femoral catheters, and sterile gauzes.\nPrepare the surgical set for the recipient: microsurgical scissors, wound retractor, pair of micro forceps, mosquito forceps, vascular micro clamps, 1 mL syringe, one 5-0 and 9-0 polypropylene sutures, 5-0 silk sutures, cotton swabs, and sterile gauzes.",
    "2. Donor heart preservation and blood collection\nInduce anesthesia in the donor rat with isoflurane (5%) in the anesthesia chamber and record the rat's weight before placing it on the surgical table.\nPlace the rat in the supine position on the surgical table and administer continuous anesthesia by delivering 2%-2.5% isoflurane with 90% oxygen through a nosecone.\nVerify the depth of anesthesia by checking the lack of response to the toe pinch and the breath frequency, which should be between 50-60 per minute.\n\tNOTE: An adequate level of anesthesia is crucial to avoid unnecessary stress and pain to the donor rat.\nApply eye lubricant and shave the region pubis to the clavicula, where the surgery will be performed. Clean the area with an iodine-based scrub and 70% alcohol.\nCatheterization\n\t\nMake a 7 cm midline abdominal incision and bilateral incisions measuring 3 cm from the xiphoid process to the mid-clavicle. Remove the pelt from the thoracic region.\nUsing cotton swabs, mobilize the abdominal organs to the left side of the abdomen. Isolate the abdominal aorta from the retroperitoneal fascia and adipose tissues.\nInject 1,000 IU heparin dissolved in 0.3 mL of isotonic saline through the inferior vena cava (IVC) using a 1 mL syringe. Stop any bleeding from the needle hole by gently compressing with a cotton swab.\n\t\tNOTE: Be cautious of air embolism during injection, as it can lead to cardiac arrest.\nInsert a 5 Fr. femoral catheter into the abdominal aorta (Abd. A). Ensure that the catheter tip reaches the aortic arch. Confirm the catheter location by assessing the approximate length of the inserted part of the catheter.\nBlood collection\n\t\nCollect around 10 mL of blood via the catheter inserted in the Abd. A.",
    "Later, dilute the priming blood with isotonic saline until the total volume reaches 12 mL. Add 5 mg of cefazolin dissolved in 0.3 mL of saline and insulin (20 IU).\nCardiac arrest\n\t\nConnect the previously prepared CPS perfusion line to the abdominal catheter and start the CPS administration with the syringe pump at a rate of 800 mL/h.\nOpen the thoracic cavity from the diaphragm and cut the IVC close to the diaphragm to prevent ventricular distention. Cut the ribs bilaterally along the thoracic spine up to the thoracic inlet. Reflect the mobilized ventral chest wall superiorly with mosquito forceps.\nRemove the thymus entirely using micro forceps to visualize the aortic arch. Apply light compression if thymic arteries bleed.\nExtraction\n\t\nAfter administering all the CPS, isolate the aortic arch from the surrounding tissues. Carefully dissect just below the left subclavian artery.\nTransect the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries at a distant position, leaving the longer stumps of the aortic arch for easy handling during aorta cannulation. Transect the main pulmonary artery (MPA) as close as possible to the bifurcation. Be cautious not to damage the left atrial appendage.\nCarefully ligate the superior vena cava (SVC) and IVC with 5-0 silk sutures, preventing the obstruction of the right atrium (RA) and coronary sinus. Cover the left margins of the thorax with wet gauze, place the heart, onto it and gently retract the SVC and IVC ligatures to expose the hilum.\nLigate the pulmonary and azygos veins together with a 5-0 silk suture. Sever the tissue dorsal to the ligature and extract the heart. Examine the heart for any injury. Finally, weigh the heart before aortic cannulation.\n3. Ex situ perfusion\nAorta cannulation and perfusion\n\t\nBefore aorta cannulation, replace the saline-primed circuit with blood priming.",
    "Insert the aortic cannula into the aortic arch and secure it with a temporary micro clamp. Ensure that the tip of the cannula is positioned at the brachiocephalic junction.\nConfirm the correct position of the cannula by gently grasping the aorta with micro forceps.\nStart the perfusion at a flow rate of 2-3 mL/min, allowing perfusate to leak from the cannulation site to remove any air bubbles.\nMonitor the perfusion pressure and temperature through the sensor connected to the monitoring system.\nGently massage the heart with the first and index fingers until venous blood leaks from the main pulmonary artery (MPA).\nSecure the aorta with a 1-0 silk ligature and remove the clamp after verifying all the settings (perfusion circuit, perfusion pressure, temperature).\nOnce the permanent ligature is placed, ensure the heart begins to contract within a few seconds and reaches normal rhythm in 60 s. A mean perfusion pressure of 55-65 mmHg with a coronary flow rate of 3-4 mL at 37 °C indicates adequate perfusion.\nCollect 0.15 mL of blood from the reservoir and check the blood gas analysis (BGA) at the beginning of perfusion and every 20 min thereafter. Monitor and record the pH, pCO2, pO2, glucose, hematocrit, potassium, and lactate during perfusion. After 120 min of perfusion, administer 3 mL of Custodiol through the syringe pump at a rate of 250 mL/h to arrest the heart.\n4. Implantation\nPreparation of recipient\n\t\nBegin the recipient preparation 30 min before the cessation of ex situ perfusion.\nAnesthetize the recipient animal using the same method as mentioned in step 2.2.\nPlace the rat in a supine position on the heating pad and insert the temperature probe into the rectum to maintain the body temperature at 37 °C.",
    "Apply eye lubricant, shave the pubic to the epigastric area, and cleanse the area with an iodine-based scrub and 70% alcohol.\nMedications\n\t\nInject 2 mL of warm saline subcutaneously to compensate for the fluid lost during the surgery. Inject 200 IU of heparin subcutaneously.\nAdminister antibiotic prophylaxis by injecting 10 mg/kg cefazolin dissolved in 0.3 mL of saline subcutaneously or intramuscularly.\nAdminister pain control by injecting 20 mg/kg of diclofenac subcutaneously.\nPerform the mid-line laparotomy and insert a retractor to widen the abdominal cavity. Mobilize the abdominal organs to the left side of the recipient using cotton swabs to make space for the procedure.\nPrevent dehydration by wrapping the abdominal organs with warm and wet gauze. Intermittingly spread warm saline with a 50 mL syringe during the surgery.\nUtilizing a surgical microscope with a 10x magnification, mobilize the duodenum and proximal jejunum by blunt dissection with cotton swabs to expose the Abd. A. and IVC. Prepare the Abd. A and IVC for anastomosis and systematically implant the donor heart, in accordance with Figure 3 or previously documented methods15.\n\tNOTE: Do not separate the Abd. A. and IVC.\n\t\nAssuming vascular anastomosis to be placed infrarenal, prepare a sufficient portion of the aorta and IVC for clamping.\nPerform blunt preparation using cotton swabs or sharp-serrated forceps to remove the fats and fascia around the vessels.\nPlace 5-0 silk ligatures to the mesenteric branches and both the cranial and caudal sides of the major vessels. Elevate the abdominal vessels and coagulate or ligate the lumbar branches with 5-0 silk sutures. Remember to spare the testicular arteries and veins and do not clamp them.",
    "Use ligatures to lift the vessels and position the micro-clamps to the mesenteric branches, caudal, and cranial sides of the major vessels to stop the blood flow at the anastomosis site. Switch off the heating pad before placing the clamps, as excess heating can exacerbate limb ischemia. Ensure to switch on the heating pad after de-clamping the vessels to avoid hypothermia.\nPuncture the aorta using a 27 G needle and elongate the incision with micro scissors to a length equal to or slightly larger than the opening of the donor ascending aorta (Asc. A), which is approximately 5 mm.\nMake a longitudinal incision on the IVC in the same way as the aortotomy, but make it 3 mm closer to the caudal side compared to the aorta incision.\nStarting the anastomoses, placed the donor heart on the right side of the recipient's abdomen and attach the donor Asc. A to the recipient's Abd. A with one simple interrupted stitch (9-0 polypropylene) at the cranial corner of the longitudinal incision.\nMove the heart to the left side of the recipient abdomen and perform anastomosis of the donor's Asc. A with the recipient's Abd. A using a running 9-0 polypropylene suture.\nFixate the donor pulmonary artery to the IVC with two interrupted sutures (9-0 polypropylene) at the caudal and cranial corners of the longitudinal incision.\nPerform the first half of the venous anastomosis from the intraluminal side of the vessel and complete the second half from the extraluminal side of the vessel. Before tightening the knots, flush the field with saline to prevent air embolism.\nDe-airing and de-clamping\n\t\nRemove the mesenteric vein clamp first after completing the anastomosis to allow the right side of the heart to fill with venous blood.",
    "Remove the air in the coronary circuit and Asc. A. by applying retrograde coronary perfusion for several seconds.\nPlace a piece of gauze on both sides of the vessels and remove the caudal clamp and the cranial clamp.\nApply gentle compression with cotton swabs for 1-2 min. After ensuring adequate hemostasis, remove the swabs and wash the anastomoses with warm saline.\n\t\tNOTE: The heart should begin beating within the first minute of reperfusion. If the recipient rat's body temperature is below 35 °C, the heart rhythm will normalize after the temperature reaches 36 °C.\nReplace the abdominal organs in a meander-like manner and close the layers of the abdominal incision using continuous 5-0 polypropylene sutures.\nAfter the surgery, place the anesthetized animal on a clean area over a heating pad until the body temperature reaches 37°C. \n\tNOTE: Do not initiate the postoperative examinations till the body temperature reaches 37°C. Maintain anesthesia at 2-2.5% isoflurane until the end of the experiments.\nMonitor the ECG of the transplanted donor heart for 3 h. Then, excise the heart under deep anesthesia for histological studies.\n\tNOTE: Confirm anesthesia depth via lack of pedal reflex before excising the heart. The surgical procedure and the ECG monitoring take less than 6 h. Diclofenac, administered perioperatively (step 4.2.3.), enables pain management for the entire duration of this procedure. The analgesia regimen can be adjusted per the institutional animal use guidelines.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
