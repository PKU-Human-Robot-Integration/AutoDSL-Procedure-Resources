    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of primary brain culture\nTiming: 10–15 days\nBefore starting dissection of mice pups, place 10 mL of 1× HBSS (in a 15 mL Falcon tube), 1 mL of 0.05% DNase I and 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin on ice and arrange dissection tools, microscope, a cold light source and 70% ethanol under the dissection hood. This step includes dissection and preparation of primary brain cultures. To obtain a confluent layer of primary astrocytes cells, collect 3–4 pups’ brains in a 15 mL tube containing 1× HBSS solution.\nPreparation of brain tissue\nTiming: 15–30 min\nBefore starting the dissection, gently hold the mice pup and spray the neck with 70% of ethanol to prevent contamination.\nDecapitation of mice can be done by using sharp scissors in one cut.\nCritical: Brain isolation can take time due to inexperience. In order to achieve high efficiency after the procedure and healthy brain culture, only one decapitation should be applied at a time and the remaining decapitation procedures should be carried out after step 14 is finished from the first mouse.\nTo keep the head fixed and stabile use anchoring forceps at orbital cavities (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1220-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection of the brain from PN0 mouse\n(A and B) (A) Cut should be performed to remove the skin and (B) skull layers covering the brain. Dashed lines indicate the cuts using Vannas spring scissors. The cut starts from the neck where the vertebral foramen is located and extends anteriorly to the nose.\n(C) Exposed brain. Scale bar: 5 mm.\nMake an incision of the skin at the hindbrain and follow along the midline to eye level where transverse cuts to the eye cavity will be made (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Grasp the skin from both sides by using Dumont #5 forceps and pull it aside to reveal the skull (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCarefully cut the cranium using a small scissors. The cut should start from the neck where the vertebral foramen is located and extended anteriorly to the nose. Make additional transverse cuts to the eye cavity.\nCritical: While cutting the cranium be sure that no excess pressure is applied to the brain. This may cause deformation in brain tissue and bleeding, which can lower culture purity because of contamination with red blood cells and endothelial cells.\nCarefully pull apart the cranium using forceps to reveal the brain.\nTake out the brain with the help of a small spatula. First, place the spatula under the cerebellum and gently push it towards the olfactory bulbs and scoop out by lifting. This will disconnect the brain from the skull base.\nTransfer the brain to a 10 cm petri dish containing ice-cold 1× HBSS under sterile conditions. The brain should submerge completely in the liquid.\nRemove olfactory bulbs in order to free the meninges. Meninges can be distinguished by their reddish color resulting from blood vessels (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1220-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Dissection of mouse brain at P0\n(A and B) Removing the meninges from mouse brain. (A) Dorsal view (B) and ventral view of isolated mouse brain. Meninges can be distinguished by reddish color in the cortex of the mouse brain. (A′ and B′) Meninges removal from the cortex of the mouse brain. Arrows indicate removed meninges from the cortex of the mouse brain. (A″ and B″) Dorsal and ventral view of completely meninges-free brain.\n(C) Dissection of brain parts with a sharp razor blade or fine forceps. Scale bars: A and B: 10 mm; C: 5 mm.",
    "Reversing the brain and starting from the bottom side can help to remove meninges easily. Dissect the meninges from the surface of the cortical layer by using fine forceps.\nNote: We observed that keeping brain integrity during the process may reduce the risk of meningeal cells and fibroblast contamination and ensure full removal.\nFlip the brain and continue meninges removal.\nCarefully check whether there is any meninges residue and if not, cut the brain into 6–10 pieces using forceps or sharp blades in order to increase disassociation efficiency (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPlace the brain pieces into a 15 mL tubes that contain 10 mL 1× HBSS and keep on ice (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1220-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Dissociation of mouse brain tissue for primary cell cultivation\n(A) Brain tissue dissected from wild type mice in 1× HBSS.\n(B) Homogenized mouse brain tissue (MBT).\n(C) MBT pellet after centrifugation.\n(D) MBT pellet after removing supernatant.\n(E) Resuspended MBT pellet in complete growth medium.\nCritical: Only 3–4 brains should be collected in 10 mL 1× HBSS. If more brain tissue is needed, use a 50 mL Falcon and increase the volume of 1× HBSS for 5 brains to 11 mL and for 12 brains 20 mL. If the brain pieces are not submerged completely, tap the bottom of the Falcon tube. This may help to submerge brain pieces that float on top.\nNote: After obtaining meninges-free brain, repeat the steps 1–14 for the rest of the mice. Doing only one brain at a time will ensure healthy cultures.\nUnder the sterile condition, add ice cold 0.05% DNase I into the tube and gently triturate brain tissue 10–15 times with a 10 mL and 2 mL pipette, respectively.",
    "Afterwards, add 0.05% trypsin, mix by using 10 mL pipette 20–30 times and incubate at room temperature (22°C–25°C) for 20 min.\nCritical: The amount of DNase I and trypsin can be adjusted depending on the number of brains in one tube. For 3–4 brains; 1 mL of DNase I and 1 mL of trypsin, for 5 brains; 1.5 mL of DNase I and 1.5 mL of trypsin, for 12 brains; 3 mL of DNase I and 3 mL of trypsin should be added.\nDuring incubation time, prepare one T-75 flask for 3–4 brains and coat with 3 mL of 0.01% Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) for 20 min. Place the T-75 flask in the incubator.\n20 min after incubation of brain pieces mix the Falcon tube thoroughly (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 150 RCF to the pellet brain tissue (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nAfter centrifugation, carefully aspirate the supernatant using a Pasteur pipette connected to a pump (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: If there is any meninges residue or blood vessel contamination, which can be distinguished by a reddish color on top of the pellet, also aspirate and discard this layer. Resuspend pellet with 2 mL of complete growth medium and repeat centrifugation step.\nResuspend cell pellet with 2–4 mL of DMEM with a 10 mL pipette and mix thoroughly 10–20 times in order to obtain a single-cell suspension (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nAspirate PLL from the T-75 flask and rinse with 10 mL of DMEM to completely wash out any residue. Add 8–10 mL of pre-warmed 37°C DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2% pen/strep.\nPlate the resuspended cell pellet and incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 in an incubator.\nChange the medium on day 1, day 2 and day 7 after plating the primary cells (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).",
    "Note: In order to remove unattached and death cells wash the plate by using 1× PBS, before adding fresh complete growth medium.\nDeriving pure primary mouse astrocyte culture\nTiming: 7–15 days\nThis step will be used for the separation of primary astrocytes cells from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), microglia and neurons. In confluence, their tight arrangement at the bottom of the culture flask can distinguish primary astrocytes cells from other cell types. Widefield microcopy distinguishes microglia cells from other brain-derived cells revealing a bright and small rounded cell morphology.\nRemoval of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs)\nTiming: 10–20 min\nMixed primary cell cultures which were obtained in steps 1 to 24 reach full confluency on days 10–15. When mixed cell culture reach confluency, gently tap the flask from both sides several times in order to detach the OPCs layer. After tapping the flask, check the cells under the microscope. Detach OPCs can be distinguished as floating cells in the plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1220-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Detached oligodendrocyte progenitor cells after tapping the flask\nOPCs are distinguished as floating cells above the monolayer of astrocytes and microglia. Arrow heads indicate round shaped floating OPCs. Scale bars: 100 μm.\nNote: In case of incomplete detachment repeat tapping several times. Tapping should be done gently so as not detach the astrocyte layer.\nAfter the OPCs are released aspirate the medium completely to remove detached cells and rinse remaining cells carefully with 10 mL of complete growth medium.\nNote: To avoid any loosening or loss of astrocyte layer, medium aspiration and rinsing should be done carefully. A 10 mL pipette should be placed at the corner of the flask and the medium should be slowly added against the wall of the flask and not directly onto the attached cells.",
    "After removing OPCs, add 10 mL of complete growth medium and ice cold 0.5 mL DNase I to loosen the remaining cell layer and incubate 5 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 in an incubator.\nAfter DNase I treatment, the remaining OPCs are released by horizontal shaking the T-75 Flask 20–30 times.\nNote: While too gentle shaking may cause insufficient OPCs removal, too intense shaking can damage the astrocyte layer. Shaking should be performed at a steady speed by hand.\nCritical: Shaking can cause foaming; therefore, the shaken flask should be held vertically for 30 s to allow the foam to float on the top.\nRemoval of microglia\nTiming: 2–2.30 h\nAspirate the medium which may still contains OPCs, and wash the astrocytes and microglia layer with 3–4 mL PBS.\nAdd 3–4 mL of 0.05% trypsin and incubate 3–5 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 in an incubator.\nCritical: Cells should not be incubated with trypsin for more than 5 min. Longer incubation time may harm primary astrocytes and results in an unhealthy culture.\nAfter incubation, check the cells under the microscope. If there is incomplete detachment, tap the slide of the flask several times and check under the microscope again.\nAfter trypsinization, add 6–7 mL of complete growth medium and resuspend the cells.\nTransfer the suspension to a new 15 mL Falcon tube and pellet detached cells by centrifugation for 10 min at 150 rcf.\nDuring centrifugation, prepare 4 sterile 10-cm bacterial grade plates. Add 2 mL of complete growth medium in each of 4 Petri dishes.\nAspirate the supernatant which you obtain after step 33 and resuspend cells with 4 mL of complete growth medium.",
    "Add 1 mL of the cell suspension to each petri dish (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A) and incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 in the incubator for 20 min (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1220-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Differential surface binding of primary astrocytes from mouse brain\n(A) Whole brain cell suspension which obtained in step 35.\n(B) Red arrow heads indicate settled microglia after 20 min of incubation.\n(C) Transferring the supernatant which obtained in step 37 to a new bacterial grade plate.\n(D) Red arrows indicate settled microglia after 90 min of incubation. Scale bar: 50 μm.\nNote: In this step, remaining microglia cells should adhere to the bacterial grade plate while primary astrocyte cells should not.\nAfter incubation, collect all supernatants containing astrocytes of all 4 Petri dishes and pool them to a new 10-cm bacterial grade plate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nCritical: The transfer of supernatant should be performed carefully as shaking of the plate may result in loosening bound microglia. Gently tilt the plate and collect the supernatant from the side of the plate.\nIncubate the supernatant (obtained in step 37) contains ∼10–12 mL medium at 37°C with 5% CO2 in the incubator for 90 min (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nNote: After incubation, check the cells under the microscope. Microglia cells should completely adhere after this step and primary astrocytes can be distinguished as floating cells in the culture medium.\nTransfer the supernatant containing primary astrocytes into a new T-75 flask.\nNote: According to volume of the obtained supernatant, add additional amount of pre-warmed complete growth medium to the T-75 flask to fill up to 20 mL.",
    "Incubate the primary astrocytes for 7–15 days at 37°C with 5% CO2 in the incubator. Primary astrocytes are reaching confluency in between day 7–15 after isolation. After culture reach confluency, primary astrocytes can be used for downstream experiments (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nCritical: Change the complete growth medium by aspirating half of the old medium (approx. 10 mL) and replacing it with a fresh, pre-warmed complete growth medium (approx. 10 mL) every 4 days during cultivation. This will provide you with a conditioned medium that will help maintain a healthy culture.\nTransfection of isolated primary astrocytes and live-cell imaging\nTiming: 3 days\nIn these steps, we describe how to transfect primary mouse astrocytes with a focal adhesion (FA) construct namely RFP-Paxillin and how to perform live imaging to investigate FA dynamics. For live-cell imaging, we use a μ-Slide 4 Well chamber (Ibidi, Munich, Germany) and for transfection, we use GeneJuice® transfection reagent (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).\nFirst, coat the μ-Slide 4 Well chamber with 300 μL of fibronectin 5 μg/mL dissolved in dH2O for 1 h at 37°C.\nNext, remove the fibronectin from the wells and wash the wells once with 500 μL of sterile 1× PBS or water. After the washing, place the chamber in the incubator in order to dry it.\nNote: Fibronectin solution can be used up to 3 times, therefore discarded fibronectin can be store at −20°C for further usage.\nCritical: If the purpose of the experiment is to study migration or focal adhesion dynamics, we strongly recommend the usage of fibronectin instead of poly-L-Lysine coating, since fibronectin may enhance cell adhesion and spreading (Blau 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nWash the primary astrocytes when reach confluency which are cultured in T-75 flask with 1× PBS and add 3 mL of 0.05% trypsin for 5 min at 37°C to detach cells.",
    "Collect the detached cells in a 15 mL tube and add 1–5 mL of growth media for preparing cell suspension. Count the number of cells and prepare 5 × 104 cell/mL suspension.\nAdd 700 μL (∼35,000 cells) of cell suspension into each well and incubate 1 day at 37°C with 5% CO2 in the incubator.\nNote: Cell number can be adjusted based on chamber size used. Cells should be at least 50% confluent before transfection.\nThe day after incubation, change the medium to fresh 700 μL of complete growth medium.\nNote: Transfection reagent volumes and DNA amount can be scaled up if more than 4 wells are needed.\nFor the single transfection of focal adhesion construct, prepare 1 Eppendorf tube and add 100 μL of Opti-MEMTM and add 6 μL of GeneJuice®. Vortex the solution thoroughly to mix it and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 2 μL of focal adhesion construct at a 1 μg/mL concentration into the serum-free/ GeneJuice® mixture and mix it by tapping the tubes and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nCritical: Do not vortex the solution after adding the DNA construct, vigorous mixing can cause low transfection efficiency.\nDrop-wisely add 27 μL of reagent/DNA mixture to the cells and rock the chamber to homogenize the solution in the complete growth medium.\nAfter 24 h of transfection remove the old medium which contains transfection reagent and add pre-warmed complete growth medium and incubate the cells for additional 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in the incubator.\nBefore starting live-cell imaging, turn on the temperature and CO2 controller of Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E/Yokogawa CSU-W1 Spinning disk microscope and wait till the condition stabilizes for usage.",
    "Acquire the movies at 1 frame/3–5 min with 20 z-stacks at 0.5 μm step size for 1.25 h to 3-h time course (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: Time interval between frames and z-stacks size and steps can be adjusted based on your experimental setup. After determining the parameter, all movies should be acquired using the same settings in order to provide experimental consistence.\nApply maximum projections to the movies and analyze focal adhesion assembly/disassembly rates by using Focal Adhesion Analysis Server (FAAS) (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]) (Berginski and Gomez 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nNote: Microtubule induced focal adhesion disassembly experiment can be used as a control experiment in order to establish the protocol (Ezratty et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Time-lapse images of RFP-Paxillin transfected BL/6 mouse primary astrocyte cell, related to step 52\nImages were acquired for 85 min with 3 min time intervals. Live-cell imaging performed under 5% CO2 and at 37°C using Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E equipped with a spinning disc microscope. Scale bar: 20 μm.\nImmunostaining of focal adhesion molecules in fixed primary astrocytes\nTiming: 4 days\nWe used a Leica DM6000B microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) for imaging of specimens.\nPrepare 10 mm glass coverslips in 6-well plates and coat with fibronectin as described in step 41–42.\nSeed 1–1.5 × 105 cells in each well and incubate the primary astrocytes cells for 48 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 in the incubator.\nAfter the 48 h incubation, carefully remove the growth medium and wash one time rapidly with 1× PBS and do second time washing using 1× PBS for 10 min in room temperature.",
    "Prepare a parafilm sheet and place it a wet chamber for keeping humidity during incubation times. Take the coverslips out from wells, place onto parafilm sheet and fix the cells by using 50 μL of 2% of PFA in 1× PBS for each coverslip for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells 2 times for 10 min with 1× PBS to remove any remaining PFA.\nPermeabilize the cells with 50 μL of 0.2% Triton-X-100 in PBS solution.\nRemove the permeabilization solution and wash cells with 50 μL of 50 mM NH4Cl in PBS for 5 min in room temperature.\nIncubate the cells with 50 μL of blocking solution (0.1% Ovalbumin and 0.5% Fish gelatin in 1× PBS) for 60 min in room temperature.\nAfter incubation, treat the cells with 50 μL of primary antibodies 12–16 h at 4°C. We used rabbit anti-GFAP (1:400 dilution) and mouse anti-vinculin (1:200 dilution) prepared in blocking solution.\nNote: Primary antibodies can be incubated at room temperature for 2–3 h.\nAfter primary antibody incubation, wash the cells with 1× PBS one time rapidly and two additional times for 10 min.\nApply the 50 μL of secondary antibodies for each coverslip. Alexa Flour 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 488 IgG antibody (1:400 diluted in blocking solution), Alexa Fluor 640-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:400 diluted in blocking solution) and the dyes TRITC-phalloidin (1:400 diluted in blocking solution) for labeling actin filaments (F-actin) and 4′,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole (DAPI) (1:400 diluted in blocking solution) for counterstaining of nucleus were prepared in a 1.5 mL tube. Incubate the cells with antibodies at room temperature for 60–75 min in room temperature.\nWash the cells with 1× PBS one time rapidly and three times for 10 min.\nMount the coverslips with Mowiol.",
    "Critical: Step 63–66 should be conducted in subdued lighting to prevent bleaching of the fluorescent probes.\nQuantification of number and length of focal adhesion molecules in the primary astrocyte cells\nTiming: 1–2 days\nImages were acquired on Leica DM6000B microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) with a 63× objective and 20 cells for each condition were used for quantification. The number and length of focal adhesion molecules were quantified by using Fiji (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). For this, we modified a protocol which previously described (Horzum et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1220-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Step by step quantification of focal adhesion (FA) numbers and lengths\nStep 77: Representative image shows merged image of primary mouse astrocytes which co-labeled with vinculin marker (magenta), actin filaments (red), GFAP (green) and for nuclear staining DAPI (blue). Step 78: After splitting channels, only vinculin staining is shown. Step 79: 8-bit image. Step 80: FFT Bandpass filter applied image. Step 81–83: Subtracting background and detecting FAs in the cell. Scale bar: 10 μm.\nOpen the images using ImageJ software.\nIf Z-projection is not created\nGo to Image-Stacks-Z Project-Maximum Projection.\nSave the processed image in the folder.\nPick an exported and processed image from the images folder.\nTo set the scale: First, draw a straight line on the image scale bar.\nGo to Analyze-Set scale\nAnd mark as global.\nVerify the scale by drawing a line on the scale bar.\nMake a duplicate image named DUP1 for the RGB image (for comparison).\nDraw a scale bar in the image near to the cell to be cropped.\nAnalyze-Tools-Scale bar\nNow, select the Rectangle box symbol from the imageJ toolbar and draw around the cell.\nThen right-click within the drawn box and press duplicate.\nGo to Image-Adjust-Brightness and contrast for adjustments and then save the image in the folder.",
