    "1. Photolithography Fabrication of Photoresist Master Mold\nThe following protocol shows the process to fabricate the microchannels with diameters between 30-60 μm. To get a microchannel with a smaller diameter (less than 30 μm), a single spin-coating of photoresist is needed.\nTransfer the reflow photoresist from the refrigerator at 4 °C to the cleanroom 24 hr prior to use and allow it to warm to room temperature.\nClean a silicon wafer and bake it for one hr at 150 °C to allow it to dehydrate. The dehydration will assist the photoresist adhesion to the silicon substrate.\nSpin-coat the first layer of photoresist using the following recipe:\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nStep,Time (Seconds),Speed (rpm),Acceleration\n1,2,300,highest\n2,10,0,\n3,3,300,highest\n4,60,600,highest\n5,10,500,highest\n6,10,600,highest\nThen, bake the wafer on a hotplate with a temperature of 110 °C for 90 sec. After the soft bake the thickness of the photoresist will be 20-30 μm.\nSpin coat a second layer of photoresist following the same recipe used for the first layer.\nSoft bake the wafer again by placing it on a hotplate with a temperature of 110 °C for 90 sec. After this soft bake the thickness of the photoresist will be 40-60 μm.\nGenerate positive master patterns by exposing the photoresist to UV light with an exposure dose of 14,500 mJ/cm2 through a film mask.\nDilute the developer with deionized (DI) water (1:2 (v/v)). Rinse the wafer repeatedly in the solution until the pattern is fully developed. Then wash the wafer with DI water and dry it using nitrogen gas.",
    "Reflow: Place the wafer on a hotplate with a temperature of 120 °C for 4 min and cover with a glass Petri dish to prevent solvent evaporation. Remove the wafer from the hotplate and allow it to cool to room temperature. The photoresist thickness after reflow will be 50-60 μm.\n2. Soft Lithography Fabrication of PDMS Microchannel Network\nPrepare polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) solution at the weight ratio of 10:1 (base:curing agent) and mix it thoroughly using a planetary centrifugal mixer.\nCast the PDMS solution onto the reflowed photoresist master mold. Place the casted PDMS in a desiccator for 15 min to degas. Use nitrogen gas to remove any remaining bubbles if necessary.\nBake the PDMS in an oven at a temperature of 60 °C for 3 hr to allow it to cure. Then remove the cured PDMS layer from the master mold.\nUse a sharpened puncher to create inlet/outlet holes by punching holes in the channel network. Clean the surface of the PDMS using nitrogen gas.\nTreat two PDMS layers with oxygen plasma for 30 sec inside a plasma cleaner at an operating pressure of 4.5 x 10-2 Torr and an oxygen flow rate of 3.5 ft3/min. Then, align the surfaces of the PDMS manually under an optical microscope. Use a drop of water if necessary for a better control of the alignment.\nBake the device in an oven at 60 °C for 30 min to achieve permanent bonding.\n3. HUVEC Culture and Seeding in the Chip\nCulture the HUVECs with culture medium with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For the experiment passages between 2 and 5 were used.",
    "Once the HUVECs are confluent, count the cells and harvest them by first rinsing the cells with HEPES buffered saline solution (HEPES-BSS), and then treat the cells with trypsin/EDTA and incubate for 2-6 min at 37 °C. After the trypsinization is complete, neutralize the trypsin/EDTA with trypsin neutralizing solution. Centrifuge and suspend the cells in culture medium with 8% dextran to collect them. Dextran was used to increase the medium viscosity to aid in better cell seeding and attachment.\nTreat the device with oxygen plasma for 5 min with an operating pressure of 4.5 x 10-2 Torr and an oxygen flow rate of 3.5 ft3/min. Then load the device with DI water and treat with UV light for 8 hr in a laminar biosafety hood for sterilization.\nOne day before the cells are ready, wash the device with 1x phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS) then coat with fibronectin (100 μg/ml, diluted with 1x PBS) and incubate in the refrigerator at 4 °C overnight.\nAfter the fibronectin coating, wash the device with 1x PBS then load with culture medium. Incubate the device at a temperature of 37 °C for 15 min.\nLoad the HUVEC cells in 8% dextran culture medium with a cell concentration of 3-4 x 106 cells/ml. Place a 20 μl droplet of cells at one inlet of the device and tilt it to introduce the cells into the microfluidic channel. After 15-20 min the cells will begin to attach to the side walls of the channels. Rotate the device every 15 min to create a more uniform distribution of cells. If necessary, additional loading can be performed.\n4. Long-term Perfusion Setup",
    "After 5-6 hr of static culture, the attached HUVECs will start to fully spread out. Set up perfusion using a remote controlled syringe pump system with a steady flow of 10 μl/hr. Perfusion can be adjusted for a higher flow rate, and can last for a time period between 4 days to 2 weeks.\n5. Cell Staining and Microscope Characterization\nWhen the cells reach confluence inside the device, firstly, wash the device with 1x PBS to thoroughly remove the medium. Then load the device with red dye diluted with diluent (4 μl-1 ml). Load the dye similar to the cell loading procedure. Incubate the device in the dark for 5 min at room temperature, and then wash the device with culture medium to stop the staining. Long incubation of the dye can cause cellular toxicity and disadhesion.\nLoad the device with blue dye diluted with 1x PBS (2 droplets per ml). Incubate in the dark for 5 min at room temperature then thoroughly wash the device with 1x PBS.\nExamine the cell staining under an inverted optical microscope. If the staining was good, load the microchannels with fixing medium (3.5% paraformaldehyde diluted with 1x PBS), then submerge the device in fixing medium and completely cover it with aluminum foil. Store the device in the refrigerator at a temperature of 4 °C to prevent the device from drying out and photobleaching. The fixed device is now ready for confocal imaging, which can be done by a laser scanning confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
