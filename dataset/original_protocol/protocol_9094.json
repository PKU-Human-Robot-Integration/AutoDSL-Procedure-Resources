    "1. Step One\nPre-anesthetic medication: 10-15 min before the induction of anesthesia, inject atropine (0.20 mg/kg) and methylprenidsolone (0.05 mg) sub-cutaneously to prevent salivation and oedema, respectively.\n2. Step Two\nInduction of anesthesia: inject pentobarbital sodium (70 mg/kg) or a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) intra-peritoneally. Let the mouse go under until no toe pinch reflex can be obtained. If the anesthesia seems too light, supplement with 1/4 of the dose.\n3. Step Three\n*Note: this surgery is a terminal procedure.\nWhen a surgical plane of anesthesia has been reached, transfer the mouse on a raised warm blanket in a prone position.\nCover the snout of the mouse with a mask delivering pure O2 at a flow around 100 ml/min.\nUsing a hair clipper, shave the dorsal region from the nape of the neck to the base of the tail.\nShave also the right hindlimb.\nFlip mouse to supine position but take care to leave the oxygen mask in place.\n4. Step Four\nSecure the mouse in place with sutures looped around the limbs and secured at the four corners of the work surface.\n5. Step Five\nInsert a temperature probe to monitor the mouse core temperature. Adjust heating blanket/lamp power to maintain core temperature between 36 °C and 38 °C.\n6. Tracheotomy and Artificial Ventilation\nUsing blunt scissors, make a cut over the trachea and pull the skin away on both sides.\nUsing blunt forceps, tear apart the salivary gland so as to expose two thin muscles (Sternohyoid) covering the trachea.\nUsing blunt forceps, separate the two muscles along their medial separation to reveal the trachea.\nUsing a Dumont 7 forceps, slide two length of 4.0 silk suture under the trachea.",
    "Make a transversal cut in the trachea in between two cartilaginous rings but take care not to completely section the trachea.\nInsert the tracheal tube down the trachea, then secure it on both sides of the insertion opening by tying the sutures over it. The tracheal tube is connected to a mouse ventilator (SAR-830/AP, CWE Inc.) and a capnograph (μcapstar, CWE Inc.). The ventilator is connected, through a compliance bag, to a source of pure O2. Adjust the parameters of the ventilator (breathing rate 100-150 bpm, end-tidal volume 170-310 μl) so that the mouse is not fighting against the artificial ventilation and the end-tidal pCO2 is stable between 4 and 5%.\n7. Placement of the Intravenous Lines\nUsing blunt dissection techniques, expose the jugular vein on one side of the neck. At this level, the jugular vein splits into two major trunks, the anterior and posterior facial veins.\nDo the following steps twice, one set for each of these trunks:\n\t\nUsing Dumont 4 or 5 forceps, carefully separate the vein from its surrounding conjunctive tissue.\nUsing Dumont 7 forceps, slide two length of 6.0 silk sutures under the vein. separate them as far as possible along the length of the vein.\nPlace a small vessel clip on the proximal side of the vein (the side closest to the heart), and tie off the distal side of the vein.\nUsing very fine iris scissors, make a small transverse incision in the vein, taking great care not to section the vein completely.\nInsert a pre-filled 1Fr catheter (premicath, Vygon) in the opening, up to the vessel clip.\nHolding the vein and the catheter together in a Dumont 4 forceps, carefully remove the vessel clip, then push the catheter a few more millimeters into the vein.",
    "Secure the catheter by tying it with both sutures on both sides of the insertion.\nOne of the catheters is connected to a syringe or a syringe pump to inject supplemental doses of anesthetics whenever necessary (usually every 10-30 min). The IV dose is either 6 mg/kg of pentobarbital sodium or 1250+40 μg/kg/min of ketamine/xylazine12. The other catheter is connected to a syringe pump for a slow intravenous infusion (50 μl/hr) of a 4 % glucose solution containing NaHCO3 (1 %) and plasmion (14 %).\n8. Close the Neck Skin with Needle and Suture, and Return the Mouse to Prone Position\n9. Dissection of the Hind-limb Muscle and Nerves\nUsing scissors, make an incision from the top of the thigh to the Achilles tendon. Separate the skin from the underlying muscles, taking care not to damage blood vessels. Cauterize as needed.\nIdentify the anterior edge of the Biceps Femoris, which appears as a white line running down the thigh. Using scissors, carefully open along the line from the knee all the way to the hip bone. Separate the muscles. The sciatic nerve is now visible under the Biceps Femoris.\nCarefully dissect the Biceps Femoris. Cauterize/ligature as needed to prevent bleeding. The Biceps Femoris can be totally removed or simply reclined to expose the sciatic nerve and the Triceps Surae muscles.\nDissect out the Sural nerve.\nUsing 8/0 silk thread, tie up the distal part of the Common Peroneal nerve and cut distal to the knot. Dissect the nerve all the way up, as close to the hip as possible.\nIdentify the Tibial nerve in between the Common Peroneal and Sural nerves. Among the different branches of the Tibial nerve, identify the branches innervating the Triceps Surae from the branches that go deeper (henceforth referred to as Tibial nerve).",
    "Using 8/0 silk thread, tie together all the branches of the Tibial nerve while keeping intact the branches innervating the Triceps Surae. Cut the the Tibial nerve distally to the knot and dissect the nerve up as far as possible.\nCover the whole hindlimb with a gauze imbibed with saline to prevent dessication while proceeding with the next step.\n10. Laminectomy\nUsing scissors, make an incision along the backbone. Separate the skin from the underlying muscles.\nMake two incisions on each side of the vertebrae to separate the subcutaneous muscles. Then cut each tendon of the muscles that attach on the side of the vertebrae on each side.\nUsing blunt forceps and a fine curette, remove the remainder of the muscle on the dorsal side of the vertebrae around the spinous processes to clearly identify each individual vertebra.\nIdentify vertebrae T13 and L1. T13 is the last vertebra to have ribs attached. The vertebral column will be immobilized using the Cunningham Spinal Cord vertebral clamps (Stoelting Co.). Place the spinal clamps on each side of T13 and L1. Be careful not to compress the spinal cord, but put a little bit of tension in the longitudinal axis. Check that the spinal column is well secured by pressing down gently with forceps.\nUsing fine rongeurs, remove the spinal processes then the laminae over T13 and L1, thereby exposing the spinal cord.\nCover the exposed spinal cord with small bits of cotton or spongel imbibed with saline to prevent desiccation.\nPlace a custom made plastic bath on top of the back, surrounding the spinal cord. Secure the bath in place using 4/0 silk thread. Ensure that the bath is waterproof by sealing it with Kwik-Cast sealant (WPI).",
    "Once the Kwik-Cast has dried, remove the cotton covering the spinal cord, and fill the bath with mineral oil.\nUsing Dumont 5 forceps and very fine iris scissors, gently pull on the dura mater surrounding the spinal cord, and open it as far as possible in both direction. Fold the dura on each side of the spinal cord.\nLower the raised platform on which the mouse is lying so as to keep it suspended by the vertebral clamp.\nUse another vertebral clamp to clamp a spinous process of the sacral region to support the back region of the animal.\nA third clamp is used to immobilize the right hindlimb and ankle, flexed at a 90° angle at the knee.\n11. Achilles Tendon Dissection\nWith the limb bent at 90° at the knee and at the ankle, remove the gauze covering the hindlimb area, and dissect the Achilles tendon free of surrounding tissue. Dissect as much as possible the Triceps Surae from surrounding tissue as well.\nCut the tendon of the Plantaris muscle close to the calcaneus, then cut it again to remove the tendon completely.\nUsing a threaded needle, attach 6/0 silk thread through the Achilles tendon and make a triple knot around the tendon.\nPlace the force transducer close to the knot, cut the distal part of the tendon, and attach it to the force transducer using the silk thread.\nInsert two lengths of stainless steel wire under the fascia of the Triceps Surae muscles. These wires are connected to an extracellular AC amplifier for EMG recording.\nPlace the Common Peroneal nerve and the Tibial nerve on two bipolar hook electrodes.\nPlace the Triceps Surae nerve on the cathode of a hook electrode, with the anode touching a nearby muscle.\nConnect all stimulating electrodes to an isolation unit.",
    "Place a ball electrode on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, connected to an extracellular AC amplifier to record cord dorsum potentials. Place an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in contact with a back muscle.\n12. Step Twelve\nStimulate the Triceps Surae nerve using a 50 μsec square pulse of increasing intensity at a low frequency (<1 Hz) until maximum twitch amplitude is observed. Slowly move the force transducer to stretch the muscle while monitoring the amplitude of the twitch response until the twitch amplitude reaches a maximum.\n13. Intracellular Recordings of Motoneurons\nFrom this point on, standard electrophysiological techniques are used to prepare an intracellular electrode, penetrate a neuron in the spinal cord and identify it as a motoneuron.\nPull a glass micropipette to a ~1 μm tip using a pipette puller (P-97 Micropipette Puller, Sutter Instruments). Fill the electrode with a KCl 3M solution (resistance of the electrode 10-20 MΩ).\nUsing a micropositioner, drive the micropipette, connected to an intracellular amplifier (Axoclamp 2B, Axon Instruments) into the spinal cord. Monitor the local field potentials elicited by the stimulation of each nerve to locate the motor pool of the Triceps Surae.\nCarefully approach putative motoneurons while monitoring the resistance of the microelectrode. When pushing against a membrane, the resistance increases. Penetration can sometime be facilitated by using the \"buzz\" function of the intracellular amplifier.\n14. Euthanasia Procedure\nAt the end of the experiment, the animal is euthanized by an overdose of pentobarbital (210 mg/kg IV), followed by decapitation.Subscription Required.
