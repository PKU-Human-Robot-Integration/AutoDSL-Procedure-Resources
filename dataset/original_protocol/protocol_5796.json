    "nMagHigh Protein Expression and purificationTransform nMagHigh with a C-terminal His6-tag in a pET-21b(+) expression plasmid into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells using a standard protocol. Prepare a starter culture from a single colony in 10 ml LB with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Incubate overnight at 37 °C at 250 rpm. Transfer 10 ml overnight culture into 1 L LB with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C at 200 rpm till OD600 = 0.6-0.8. When the desired OD600 is reached, add 500 µl IPTG (1 M stock, 500 µM final concentration) to the culture and incubate overnight at 16 °C at 250 rpm. Pellet bacteria at 6,371 x g at 4 °C for 8 min using the high-speed centrifuge with the JA-10 rotor (500 ml centrifuge tube). Discard the supernatant. All the following steps must be done on ice.Resuspend the pellet in 20 ml Buffer A (Recipe 1) containing supplemented with 1 mM PMSF (100 mM stock in methanol) and 1 mM DTT (1 M stock in water). Transfer the suspension into a 50 ml Falcon tube.Lyse bacteria by sonication. Settings for tip sonicator: 50% frequency, 40% power, 10 min. Keep the Falcon on ice during sonication. Transfer lysate into plastic high-speed centrifuge tubes, Centrifuge at 17,418 x g, 4 °C for 30 min using the JA-25.50 rotor (50 ml centrifuge tube).Filter the supernatant through 0.45 µm cellulose filter twice. Equilibrate Ni-NTA column (column volume = 5 ml) with 20-30 ml Buffer A + 1 mM DTT.Load clarified cell lysate on to the Ni-NTA column by passing the lysate twice dropwise using a 50 ml syringe.
