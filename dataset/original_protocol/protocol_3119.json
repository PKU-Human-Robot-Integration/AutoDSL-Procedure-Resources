To improve cell viability, keep cells on ice\n      during all steps, except for the gradient spin.\n    \n        Dissociate collagenase-digested mouse liver by gentle pipetting.\n        \n            Filter through a 40\n            \n μ  M filter into a 50 mL conical tube.\n          \nFill the 50 mL conical tube with RPMI 1640 media.\nSpin at 60 × g for 2 min at 4°C.\nNote: Centrifuge [Sorvall Legend T\n      Benchtop Centrifuge, with rotor: 75006445] is pre-cooled to 4°C.\n      Alternative desk-top centrifuge with swinging bucket rotors may be\n      utilized.\n    \nNote: The purpose of this spin is to\n      pellet the hepatocytes. The supernatant will contain the liver NPCs, which\n      include endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and\n      immune cells.\n    \n        Carefully collect the supernatant and transfer it to a new 50 mL conical\n        tube using an automatic pipettor.\n      \nNote: The supernatant volume varies\n      between 40–45 mL.\n    \nNote: After collecting the supernatant,\n      the hepatocyte pellet can be either collected for downstream applications\n      or discarded.\n    \n        Repeat steps #1 and #2 at least three times to remove nearly all\n        hepatocytes.\n      \n        Centrifuge NPC-containing supernatant at 400 × g for 10 min at\n        4°C.\n      \n        Create Percoll gradients by layering 25% Percoll solution over 50%\n        Percoll solution, if not already done.

LECs can be sorted on DAPI-\n      (live cells), CD45- (hematopoietic marker), and CD31+\n      (endothelial marker). Cell sorting was conducted on BD FACS Aria II\n      platform and analysis of cells were conducted on FlowJo software.\n      Alternative FACS sorters are Sony SH800, or BD FACS Aria III platform.\n      Sorting instructions are beyond the scope of this protocol.

The purpose of\n      cytocentrifugation is to place a monolayer of cells onto a circular area\n      on a slide. This allows cells to be kept intact for further examination of\n      cellular and subcellular proteins and structures.\n    \nNote: All cytocentrifugation buffers and\n      recipes are outlined in\n      materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.
