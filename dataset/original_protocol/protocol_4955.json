  "procedures": [
    "Flow cytometry analysisThis procedure uses flow cytometry to determine whether a fluorescently labelled peptide can be internalized by a bacterium of interest. Flow cytometry measures a large number of individual cells and therefore provides a strong support for the significance of peptide uptake.Pick up a single colony of the bacterial strains grown onto agar plates with the appropriate medium.Suspend the bacteria in 5 ml of sterile liquid medium in polypropylene tubes with ventilation cap and incubate with shaking (140 rpm) at 37 °C for E. coli and S. typhimurium, or 30 °C for S. meliloti and Bradyrhizobium. Growth is overnight (approximately 18 h) for E. coli, S. typhimurium and S. meliloti, and 3 days for the slow growing Bradyrhizobium.Dilute the pre-cultures 1:30 in fresh medium and incubated them by shaking at the appropriate temperature to obtain mid-log phase bacteria, approx. 2 h for E. coli and S. typhimurium, 4 h for S. meliloti and overnight for Bradyrhizobium.Note:  The use of a mid-log phase culture (OD600 = 0.3-0.5) is important to obtain reproducible results since some bacterial species may become insensitive or less sensitive to certain peptides at later growth phases.Bradyrhizobium samples are washed 3 times with 1 volume sterile PBT before proceeding to the next step. This washing step allows the peptides to interact more efficiently with the bacterial membrane.Adjust the bacteria to 1 x 106 to 1 x 107 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/ml (OD600 ~0.01 to 0.05) in MHB for E. coli and S. typhimurium or PB for S. meliloti and Bradyrhizobium.Prepare 1 ml aliquots of bacterial suspension in Eppendorf tubes.",
    "Add the fluorescently-labelled peptide to the bacteria and incubate samples for chosen times (usually a few minutes to one hour, depending on the bacterial strain and the peptide) at 37 °C or 30 °C according to the bacterial strain used. Prepare one tube for each peptide concentration and time point and arrange a negative control without peptide. Note: To evaluate correctly peptide internalization, select a concentration that is below the membrane-permeabilizing concentration of the peptide. This information can be obtained by a PI-uptake assay as described in the supplementary Procedure C or Procedure D.Wash samples three times in BHSS (for E. coli and S. typhimurium) or PB (for S. meliloti and Bradyrhizobium) in order to remove the fraction of peptide that is bound weakly to the bacterial surface. Resuspend cells in 1 ml of BHSS or PB, respectively.Analyze samples by the flow cytometer. Gate on the bacterial population using the forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) parameters. Use filter settings that are adapted for the fluorophore used. The detector is set to logarithmic amplification. A total number of 10,000 to 50,000 events are usually acquired for each sample.Plot the number of counted events as a function of the fluorescence intensity (Figure 1). Cytometric data analysis may be performed using the FCS Express software, the Summit 6.2.2 software or equivalent software.Add trypan blue to each bacterial sample at 1 mg/ml final concentration.Incubate 10 min at room temperature and then analyze all samples again as in steps A8 and A9.Confocal scanning laser microscopyThis procedure is complementary to Procedure A. It can confirm for a smaller number of cells peptide uptake or membrane association.Prepare samples as described until step A7 in Procedure A.",
    "Place 1 to 10 µl of each treated bacterial suspension between slide and cover-glass to obtain an immobile monolayer of cells. Observe samples with a confocal laser scanning microscope using a 63x or 100x objective. Analyse the image stacks collected by the confocal microscope using appropriate software, e.g., for image acquisition Leica Application Suite X or EZ-C1 Free Viewer and for image processing ImageJ.Observe the distribution of fluorescence on the cell surface and inside the bacterial cells (Figure 2).Supplementary procedures: if the membrane permeabilization activity of the peptide of interest is unknown, Procedures C and D can be used to determine a concentration at which the fluorescent peptide does not affect the bacterial membrane permeability, providing a working concentration to be used in Procedures A and B. Propidium iodide uptake assay by microplate readerPrepare samples as described until step A3 in Procedure A.Adjust the bacteria to 1 x 107 to 1 x 108 CFU/ml (OD600 ~0.1) in MHB for E. coli and S. typhimurium or PB for S. meliloti and Bradyrhizobium.Add PI to each bacterial sample at 10 µg/ml final concentration.Add samples to a microplate, 190 µl per well.Add 10 µl peptide to each sample at the required final concentration.Note: A range of concentrations should be tested from one tenth of the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration or lower till the minimal inhibitory concentration. Typical Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations for antimicrobial peptides are in the range of 1 to 10 µM.Immediately measure fluorescence in the fluorescence plate reader. Using Magellan software, acquire data every 2 min for 120 cycles. Filters for PI fluorescence are: excitation 536-539 nm filter; emission 617-620 nm filter.Analyse data in an Excel data sheet (Figure 3).Propidium iodide uptake assay by flow cytometry (alternative to Procedure C)Prepare samples as described until step A4 in Procedure A.",
    "Aliquot 1 ml of bacterial suspension into the tubes. Prepare one tube for each concentration of peptide.Add PI to each sample (final concentration 10 μg/ml).Add the peptide to the desired concentration and incubate in a thermostatic bath at 37 °C.Acquire each sample with the flow cytometer every 15 min (for maximum 2 h).Plot the number of cells as a function of the PI fluorescence signal (at 620 nm).For each incubation time, evaluate the percentage of permeabilised cells (Figure 4)."
