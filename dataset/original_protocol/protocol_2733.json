Cell cycle synchronization\nTiming: 4 days\nIn this step, culture cells are synchronized at G1/S boundary or mitosis and go through cell cycle stages synchronously. The step helps monitor the S phase and mitotic stages because the cell numbers of the S phase and mitotic cells are lower than those in other cell-cycle stages.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nDouble-thymidine synchronization for G1/S stage.\nSeed HeLa cells at 2 × 106 cells /10 cm dish for each time point.\nNote: According to sample numbers, culture is scaled up. For each time point, seed two 10 cm dishes with 2 × 106 HeLa cells for extraction.\nNote: Ensure uniform distribution across the culture dish. The aggregation of the cells would inhibit the growth, resulting in poor synchronization.\nAllow the cells to grow for 16 h from the seeded time point and replace the media with supplemented DMEM media containing thymidine, which can arrest the cell at G1/S boundary by inhibiting DNA synthesis.\nAfter treatment with thymidine for 16 h, wash the cells twice with 10 mL of drug-free supplemented DMEM media prewarmed at 37°C.\nCulture the cells in drug-free supplemented DMEM media for 10 h.\nAfter 10 h, replace the media with supplemented DMEM media containing thymidine and allow the cells to grow under the thymidine-containing media for 16 h.\nAfter 16 h, wash the drug-treated cells twice with 10 mL of drug-free supplemented DMEM media prewarmed at 37°C and cultured under drug-free supplemented DMEM media. Cells are harvested at the selected time points (ex. 3, 6,9,12, 15, 18 h).\nNote: To confirm cell cycle status, prepare a FACS sample at 4 × 105 cells /6 cm dish per time point.\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nThymidine and nocodazole block for synchronization in mitosis.",

Collect the cells arrested in mitosis at time zero.\nWash the cells twice with 10 mL of drug-free supplemented DMEM media prewarmed at 37°C. Culture the cells in drug-free supplemented DMEM media. Harvest the cells at selected time points (ex. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min).\nNote: To confirm cell cycle status, prepare a FACS sample at 4 × 105 cells /6 cm dish per time point [troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]].\nPart 2. Preparation of cell extracts\nTiming: 1 h, days\nIn this step, prepare the cell extracts from synchronized cells at each time point. The cell extract at each time point should be extracted immediately after cell collection to avoid the degradation of protein and the breakage of protein complexes by freezing.\nRemove the media by decantation, dislodge the cells directly by scraping, and transfer the cells and media (∼1 mL) into 1.5 mL tubes.",
    "Spin down the cells at 80 × g for 5 min at room temperature and wash the cells twice with 500 μL of PBS. Add 500 μL of ice-cold NP-40 lysis buffer (per 2 × 10 cm dishes) and suspend the cells by pipetting 10 times. Incubate on ice for 20 min.\nMix the suspension with a Vortex mixer for 15 s at full speed to disrupt viscous materials. Alternatively, carry out benzonase treatment, sonication, or homogenization on the lysates to break the DNA. Centrifuge the cell extracts at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Transfer the supernatant to clean tubes.\nMeasure the protein concentration of the supernatant using a standard Bradford protein assay.\nNote: ∼7 mg of protein is obtained from two 10 cm dishes of HeLa cells.\nPause point: No pause points in this step.\nPart 3. Preparation of stepwise glycerol gradient for fractionation of protein complex by size\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this step, make the stepwise gradient for centrifugation and fractionate the sample after centrifugation. The making gradient and fractionation of the sample are critical for size fractionation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2391-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Glycerol gradient centrifugation\n(A) 800 μL of the highest glycerol concentration in NP-40 lysis buffer is first layered in the bottom of a 5 mL tube. Stepwise, 800 μL of each glycerol concentration in NP-40 lysis buffer is overlayed gently on the previous layer. After standing for 1 h at 4°C, the boundary of gradients is diffused and becomes invisible.\n(B) After centrifugation, the gradient is fractionated from top to bottom using a micropipette. The pipet is positioned at the tube’s center and brings the tip of the pipette-tip vertically near the liquid surface. The surface is swelled by surface tension (arrowhead). Maintain the immersion depth and aspirate the sample carefully.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2391-Fig2.jpg",

    "Note: Using SW 55 Ti rotor, up to 1 mg of cell extracts is used for the best result. The sample volume is a maximum of up to 1/10 volume of tube size.\nUltracentrifuge at 30,000 × g for 18 h at 4°C.\nNote: Set the acceleration and deceleration to a minimum.\nAfter centrifugation, fractionate the gradient from top to bottom using a micropipette with surface tension (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Each fraction volume is 200 μL.\nAdd an equal amount of ice-cold TCA solution to 20 μL of each fraction to precipitate proteins and mix with a Vortex mixer for 15 s at full speed. Incubate the mixture on ice for 30 min and centrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant, rinse the pellet fraction with ice-cold ethanol, and centrifuge for 5 min at 12,000 × g at 4°C. Dry the pellet and resuspend it into 50 μL of 1 × SDS sample buffer. 1/10 volume of each sample will be subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis.\nNote: For estimation of the mass of the protein complex, prepare sedimentation markers with the same concentration of glycerol gradient conditions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). A sedimentation markers: 4.2S Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), 8.9S beta-amylase (200 kDa), 17.6S apoferritin (443 kDa), 19S Thyroglobulin (670 kDa).\nPause point: No pause points in this step.
