    "1. Prepare Starting Materials and Equipment for Assays\nPrepare hydrolyzates using 18 to 20% initial biomass dry weight in the pretreatment reaction for use in the evolution, isolation and ranking procedures. See Slininger et al. 201518 for the detailed methods to prepare AFEX CSH, PSGHL, and SGH with nitrogen supplements N1 or N2 used in evolution, isolation or ranking. See Table 1 for composition of each hydrolyzate type.\n\tNOTE: Nitrogen fortifications of SGH were designated as SGH-N1 or SGH-N2 defined as follows: SGH-N1 = SGH fortified to 42:1 molar carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) with nitrogen sources including urea, vitamin-free amino acids from casein, D,L-tryptophan, L-cysteine, and vitamins from defined sources (such that ~15% of molar nitrogen N is primary amino nitrogen (PAN) and ~85% of N is from urea); SGH-N2 = SGH fortified to 37:1 C:N with urea and soy flour as the lowest cost commercial source of amino acids and vitamins, providing ~12% of N from PAN and 88% as urea.\nAcquire a lyophilized culture of the parent strain, Scheffersomyces stipitis NRRL Y-7124 (CBS 5773) from the ARS Culture Collection (National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, Peoria, Illinois), and prepare glycerol stock cultures as directed. Maintain stock cultures of the parent yeast and its derivatives in 10% glycerol at -80 °C.\n\t\nStreak glycerol stocks to yeast malt peptone dextrose (YM) agar plates (3 g/L yeast extract, 3 g/L malt extract, 5 g/L peptone, 10 g/L dextrose, 20 g/L agar) and incubate 48-72 hr at 25 °C.8 Developed plates can be stored up to a week at 4 °C prior to use as liquid pre-culture inocula.",
    "Prepare Optimal Defined Medium (ODM), a synthetic medium compatible with industrial formulation procedures20 that was previously developed for optimal conversion of xylose to ethanol by the parent strain Scheffersomyces (Pichia) stipitis NRRL Y-7124.7 Use the defined medium in all precultures and cultures for fermentation performance bioassays and also for ethanol challenged, xylose-fed continuous culture evolution. ODM composition is listed for reference in Table 2.\nAs described previously,18 analyze cell biomass using a cuvette- or micro-plate reading spectrophotometer, as appropriate, to measure culture absorbance at 620 nm (A620). Quantitate sugars, ethanol, furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and acetic acid in culture samples using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or robotic enzymatic determination of glucose and xylose for higher throughput.\n2. Enrich Robust Derivatives during Serial Transfer on AFEX CSH\nInoculate a preculture of strain NRRL Y-7124. Transfer cells from YM agar to 75 ml ODM + 150 g/L xylose to maintain the ability to grow under osmotic stress. Incubate precultures in 125 ml flasks closed with silicon sponge plugs 24 hr at 25 °C with shaking (150 rpm, 1\" orbit).\nThaw frozen aliquots of 6-12% glucan AFEX CSH in cold water for use. Adjust pH to 5 if needed and filter sterilize prior to preparing a dilution series in 96-well microplates.\nFill microplates with 50 µl per well and 8 wells per hydrolyzate dilution, then inoculate with a few microliters of preculture per well to allow an initial absorbance (620 nm) A620 ≥0.1. Incubate plates statically 24-48 hr at 25 °C in a plastic box with a wet paper towel for humidity.\nUsing the most concentrated hydrolyzate dilution that visibly grew to A620 >1, transfer 1-5 µl to each well of a new hydrolyzate dilution series to achieve initial A620 ≥0.1.",
    "Monitor growth culture A620 in microplates with a spectrophotometer. An uninoculated dilution series serves as a control and blank. Plate lids are left on during monitoring to prevent contamination, and the readings adjusted accordingly.\nPrepare glycerol stocks of adaptation cultures regularly for subsequent isolation of improved strains or for use in reinoculating the continuing hydrolyzate dilution series. To prepare stocks, pool four wells (200 µl) of the greatest hydrolyzate concentration colonized. Mix 1:1 with 20% sterile glycerol in cryovials, to freeze cells in 10% glycerol at -80 °C.\nRepeat steps 2.3-2.6 until growth in 12% glucan AFEX CSH is consistently visible at 24 hr.\n3. Isolate Single Cell Tolerant Derivatives after Enrichment on AFEX CSH\nStreak selected glycerol stocks of adaptation cultures to YM agar, and use streaks to inoculate 50 µl of 3% or 6% glucan AFEX CSH (pH 5) in each of three microplate wells (initial A620 ~0.1). Incubate microplates 24 hr as in step 2.3. Pool replicate colonized wells at the highest hydrolyzate strength with strong growth, and dilution plate to YM or 6% glucan AFEX CSH agar. Prepare the latter as a 1:1 mix of filter sterilized 12% glucan AFEX CSH with warm autoclaved 30 g/L agar solution.\nPick 5 single colonies from the highest dilution plate showing growth after 24-48 hr incubation at 25 °C to freeze as glycerol stock cultures. Streak each colony to a YM plate. Incubate 24 hr. With a sterile loop, transfer a developed streak of cells to a small volume of 10% glycerol, mix to suspend cells, and distribute to 2-3 cryovials for freezing at -80 °C.\n4. Evaluate Performance of AFEX CSH Tolerant Derivatives Compared to Parent\nTest Isolates in Simple 6% Glucan AFEX CSH Batch Cultures.",
    "Transfer cells from 48 hr plates streaked from glycerol stocks to pH 7 potassium phosphate buffer (0.4 mM) to prepare cell suspensions with A620 = 10. Use 1 µl of each suspension to inoculate each of four wells of 50 µl 3% glucan hydrolyzate to initial A620 = 0.2. Incubate microplates 24 hr as in step 2.3. Prepare the 3% glucan AFEX CSH at pH 5 by diluting 12% glucan AFEX CSH 1:3 with sterile water.\nTransfer two 24 hr microplate wells to inoculate 25 ml precultures of pH 5 12% glucan AFEX CSH used at 50% of full strength. Incubate precultures in 50 ml flasks with silicon sponge closures for 24 hr at 25 °C, ~150 rpm (1\" orbit). Prepare the half-strength 12% glucan AFEX CSH by diluting the hydrolyzate 1:1 with sterile water.\nUse half-strength hydrolyzate precultures to inoculate similar 25 ml growth cultures to initial A620 = 0.1. Incubate the growth cultures as above (4.1.2) and sample daily (0.2 ml). Monitor accumulations of biomass (A620) and concentrations of sugars and fermentation products (HPLC).\nAlternatively, repitch (i.e., harvest and reuse) populations of 6% glucan AFEX CSH-grown yeast for testing in 8% glucan hydrolyzate batch cultures, as described previously.18\nAlternatively, further test populations of repitched 6% glucan AFEX CSH cultures by feeding with 12% glucan hydrolyzate, as described previously.18\nTest diauxic lag of isolates in batch cultures of ODM with mixed sugars.\n\t\nInoculate precultures of 75 ml ODM with 150 g/L xylose in 125 ml flasks with silicone sponge closures by loop transfer from YM glycerol streaks. Incubate 24 hr as in step 2.1.\nUse precultures to inoculate similar 75 ml test cultures with ODM containing 75 g/L of glucose and 75 g/L of xylose at pH 6.5. Shake flasks at 25 °C, 150 rpm. Sample daily.",
    "Alternatively, test the impact of 0-15 g/L acetic acid on diauxy during fermentation of glucose and xylose by using a similar protocol, except initial pH is set at 6.0 ± 0.2 in test cultures to maintain pH 6-7 during acetic acid consumption, as previously described.18\n5. Apply Continuous Culture to Select for Ethanol-challenged Xylose Utilization\nPrepare ODM as the continuous culture feed medium with 60-100 g/L xylose, 20-50 g/L ethanol at pH 6.3 ± 0.2. Choose combinations of xylose and ethanol to simulate the partial fermentation of 150 g/L xylose, assuming a potential yield of ~0.5 g ethanol/g xylose, and to accommodate the potential for 50-70 g/L ethanol to occur.8\nTo prepare the continuous culture inoculum, transfer a representative AFEX CSH-tolerant colony (analogous to Colony 5 in example, Figure 1) by loop from a 48 hr YM plate to 75 ml of the ethanol-free ODM (100 g/L xylose, in this case) in 125 ml flasks. Incubate at 25 °C, 150 rpm (1\" orbit) for 24 hr. Choose the preculture ODM xylose concentration to match that of the initial continuous culture holding volume.\nInoculate a continuous culture holding volume of ODM at pH 6.3 ± 0.2 having 100 g/L xylose + 20 g/L ethanol with ~5-10 ml of a preculture concentrate of a AFEX CSH-tolerant isolate (analogous to Colony 5, Figure 1) to obtain 100 ml at initial A620 ~0.5. Maintain the culture holding volume (VR), at 25 °C in a jacketed 100 ml spinner flask stirred at 200 rpm and outfitted with sterilizable pH electrode, pH controller and temperature-controlled circulating water bath.",
    "Initially, since cell growth will be slow due to the ethanol exposure, set up the feed medium to dose using a pH-actuated pump. Set the pump to feed pH-6.3 ODM with 100 g/L xylose and 50 g/L ethanol when the culture fermentation drops the pH to 5.4, thus stopping further pH drop. Maintain the volume at 100 ml with an effluent pump continuously skimming the culture surface. Consequently, ethanol concentration rises with continued metabolism and feeding.\nMeasure effluent and draw samples (1-2 ml) from continuous cultures every 48-72 hr for analysis of viable cell concentration, products and substrates, as previously described.18 To find viable cell concentration, make serial 1:10 dilutions of samples in buffer (see 4.1.1) and spread plate the dilutions to YM agar (see 1.2.1). Based on effluent collection rates (Q), calculate the dilution rate (D) (Q/VR), and, in the example of S. stipitis, it varied from 0 to 0.01 hr-1.\nSave glycerol stocks regularly by isolating from viability plates of buffered sample dilutions forming 30-100 colonies, representing most prevalent robust colonists at that time in enrichment. Flood plates with ~5 ml of 10% glycerol to allow preparation of duplicate cryovials. For maintenance or a respite, stop the continuous culture and restart as needed using most current (resistant) glycerol stock(s).\nTo restart, streak the glycerol stock(s) of most resistant populations to YM agar and transfer 24-48 hr cells by loop to a pre-culture of ethanol-free ODM for incubation as above. Inoculate the 100 ml holding volume of ODM to initial A620 0.5 using a concentrate of the precultured yeast, and allow the culture to grow batch-wise to stationary phase before the feed medium flow is restarted.",
    "If cultures can grow steadily at >0.01 hr-1 on xylose in the presence of >25 g/L ethanol, start the continuous culture feed (ODM + 60 g/L xylose + ethanol ranging 30 to 50 g/L) at a low dilution rate ~0.01 hr-1 to the 100 ml holding volume (initially ODM + 60 g/L xylose + 20 g/L ethanol). Over time, raise the ethanol in the feed toward 50 g/L. Capture advanced populations in glycerol stocks.\n\tNOTE: Maintaining the low dilution rate allows formation of a high enough cell concentration to reduce oxygen availability and support fermentation.\nOptionally, apply ultra-violet (UV) irradiation monthly to glycerol stock populations used to reinoculate continuous cultures.\n\t\nResuspend colonies from glycerol stock streaks in 10 ml of ODM (as in precultures) with 60 g/L xylose, and pool all stocks in a single sterile flask. Apply the pooled cell suspension at ~5 x 108 viable cells/ml to just cover the bottoms of 4-5 Petri plates with 6 ml/plate. To obtain 6 ml coverage of a standard disposable petri plate, dispense 15 ml to overcome surface tension, and then remove 9 ml.\nExpose each open culture plate to UV from the light source in a biological safety cabinet. Adjust the UV exposure time or distance to obtain the desired kill rate >90%. Here, expose for 45 min at around 56 cm from the source.\nDilute plate cell suspensions before and after irradiation. Estimate kill rate based on colony forming units. For the S. stipitis example, the kill rate was ~97%.",
    "Transfer the UV-exposed cultures (24-30 ml) to a foil-covered 50 ml flask, and incubate at 25 °C and 150 rpm for 24 hr to allow the small percentage of viable cells to repopulate to ~1 x 108 viable S. stipitis cells/ml. By preventing photo reactivations, the foil cover preserves mutations while cultures are incubated.\nUse the repopulated mutagenized culture to inoculate continuous cultures to ~1 x 107 viable cells/ml. Restart the ethanol-enriched ODM + 60 g/L xylose medium feed to continue the selection process.\n6. Evaluate Glycerol Stock Populations and Identify Those with Improved Xylose Fermentation in the Presence of Ethanol\nStreak selected glycerol stock cultures to YM agar as the first step in the screen for best growth and fermentation of xylose in the presence of ethanol.\nTransfer each evolved population to be screened from agar streaks to 75 ml precultures in ODM with 150 g/L glucose, and incubate in 125 ml flasks 96 hr prior to use as inocula for test cultures. The large glucose-grown populations will require induction of enzymes for xylose utilization.\n\t\nTo test induction, harvest each culture, suspend cells to 30 ml, initial A620 of 40 in ODM +60 g/L xylose + 30-45 g/L ethanol, and incubate at 25 °C, 150 rpm (1\" orbit) in 50 ml flasks with silicon sponge closures. Draw samples twice daily for monitoring xylose uptake by HPLC analysis.",
    "Alternatively, as described in Slininger et al.,18 to assess growth on xylose in the presence of ethanol, prepare precultures of each evolved population by loop transfer to 75 ml of ODM with 150 g/L xylose in 125 ml flasks, and incubate 96 hr at 25 °C, 150 rpm (1\" orbit). Inoculate test cultures to a low initial A620 of 0.1 in 25 ml of ODM + 60 g/L xylose + 30-45 g/L ethanol in 125 ml flasks. Incubate flasks at 25 °C, 300 rpm, 1\" orbit and sample.\n7. Isolate Single-cell Colonies That Utilize Xylose in PSGHL When Ethanol Is Present\nBased on results of step 6, select glycerol stock populations showing superior ability to grow on and ferment xylose in the presence of ethanol. Use these to streak plates. The streak plates are used to prepare dense, buffered cell suspensions of A620 = 5.  Then cell suspensions are used to inoculate precultures in 96-deep well plates to A620 = 0.5. Inoculate 1 ml precultures on PSGHL mixed 1:1 with ODM + 50 g/L xylose (no ethanol). Incubate precultures in 96-well, deep well plates with vented low evaporation covers for 48 hr at 25 °C, 400 rpm, 1\" orbit. Separate different glycerol stock populations by empty wells.\nUsing each preculture, inoculate sixteen 1 ml replicate cultures to initial A620 ~0.5 in 1:1 PSGHL:ODM+50 g/L xylose with 20, 30, or 40 g/L ethanol to enrich tolerant colonists. Incubate enrichment cultures similarly to precultures.\nFor each different glycerol stock, harvest the culture wells with highest ethanol concentration allowing growth and xylose use. Plate each cell line to YM agar to obtain prevalent single colonies to preserve in glycerol. Pick ten colonies per cell line and streak each to a YM agar plate for glycerol stock preparation.",
    "8. Further Enrich Robust Evolved Strains during Serial Transfer on PSGHL, as for AFEX CSH\nPrepare pre-cultures of NRRL Y-7124 (parent), AFEX CSH-tolerant evolved isolate, and continuous culture evolved population with enhanced ability to use xylose in the presence of ethanol. Inoculate 75 ml of ODM + 150 g/L xylose by loop from glycerol stock streaks as described above (step 2.1) for the AFEX CSH hydrolyzate adaptation process.\nDilute PSGHL with water to provide a series of increasing concentrations. Prepare a 96-well micro-plate for each of the three cell lines by using each PSGHL dilution to fill 8 wells with 50 µl. Use preculture to inoculate each 50 µl micro-culture of the dilution series to initial A620 ~0.1-0.5.\n\t\nContinue the evolution of yeast in increasing strengths of PSGHL using the same procedure as the AFEX CSH hydrolyzate adaptation detailed above (step 2) until cultures are able to grow in the full strength hydrolyzate at a stable 14-d average ratio of ΔA620 per Δtime as serial transfers are continued an additional four months.\n9. Isolate Single-cell Colonies Using PSGHL Gradients with or without Ethanol Challenge\nObtain single-cell isolates directly from full strength PSGHL final adaptation plates by dilution plating to YM agar. Pick ten large colonies for each of the three cell lines and bar streak to YM plates to prepare glycerol stocks as previously described (step 3.2).\nOptionally, explore earlier time points in the evolution process by isolating from stored glycerol stocks of the three cell lines.\n\t\nInoculate a preculture for each cell line by loop from glycerol stock streaks and incubate 24 hr on 30 ml ODM + 50 g/L xylose (50 ml flasks, 25 °C, 150 rpm).",
    "Challenge cells from precultures to growth in hydrolyzate by inoculating 50 µl of 50% PSGHL in microplate wells to an initial A620 ~0.2 and incubating statically 48 hr.\nSpread 0.1 ml of each enriched culture onto PSGHL gradient agar plates ranging from 0 to 50% strength hydrolyzate (delivering ~300-400 viable cells per plate), and pick 10 single colonies per cell line from the highest possible hydrolyzate concentration area of the gradient.21 Streak picked colonies to YM for glycerol stock preparation as in step 3.2.\nAs an alternative to step 9.2.3, instead of inoculating the gradient agar plates, inoculate wells of 96-well micro-plates to initial A620 ~0.2, where the wells are designed to contain a range of hydrolyzate concentrations from 50 to 100% strength and ethanol from 10 to 40 g/L. In this case, develop micro-plates 72-96 hr and otherwise as in step 2.3. Isolate ten single colonies from wells of the harshest hydrolyzate-ethanol combinations showing growth via dilution plating, and prepare glycerol stocks as in step 3.2.\n10. In a Primary Screen, Eliminate Inferior Isolates by Comparing and Ranking Performances on PSGHL at Two Nutrient Conditions\nApply a high throughput deep well plate screen of PSGHL performance to screen five sets of thirty isolates along with NRRL Y-7124 parent and AFEX CSH-tolerant isolate (analogous to Colony 5 of the Figure 1 evolution example) as controls to choose six top strains (20%) from each set to pass to the secondary screening level (step 12).",
    "Carry out the screen in deep well plates filled 1 ml per well and covered with stainless steel lids with black silicone low evaporative seals. Clamp all plates to the board of the incubator/shaker and operate at 25 °C and 400 rpm (1\" shaker orbit). Design all deep well plate filling patterns to allow separation of different isolates by open wells.\nTo begin cultivations, pick a bead of cells from glycerol streaks prepared from 30 isolates obtained as above (in steps 3, 7, and 9) to duplicate wells of ODM + 50 g/L xylose and incubate 48 hr.\nAs a challenge medium for preculturing isolates, prepare 50% PSGHL by mixing PSGHL 1:1 with ODM + 10 g/L glucose + 50 g/L xylose. For screening 30 isolates and two control strains, 2 plates with 2 wells per each of 16 isolates are filled, leaving empty wells between the different isolates.\nFor challenge cultures, transfer, a 50 µl volume of ODM pre-cultures (A620 ~10) to each of two 50% PSGHL challenge culture wells for each of the isolates and controls to obtain an initial A620 ~0.5 and incubate 72 hr.\nUse two test media of different nutritional richness for screening isolates: 60% PSGHL + ODM nutrients; and 75% PSGHL + ODM + YM nutrients. Add ODM nutrients (excluding sugars) at half of the strength as standard for ODM use with 50 g/L sugar (step 1.3). As designated, add YM nutrients (excluding sugars) at half of the standard strength of 3 g/L yeast extract, 3 g/L malt extract, 5 g/L peptone.\nInoculate test cultures by transferring 50 µl of 72 hr 50% PSGHL challenge pre-cultures to inoculate 1,000 µl to initial A620 ~0.5 in five deep wells for each of two test media.",
    "Sample each isolate daily. Pipette the contents of a well to a microfuge tube and centrifuge (5,533 x g, 15 min) to obtain supernate for ethanol, glucose and xylose high throughput analyses. Measure biomass as A620 in 96-well micro-plates (200 µl/well) with a spectrophotometer.\nWithin each set of 30 isolates tested (5 sets for S. stipitis NRRL Y-7124 evolved strains), calculate relative performance indexes (RPI) as described in step 11 below and use to rank each strain based on ethanol yield (maximum ethanol accumulated per initial sugar supplied) and xylose uptake rate (xylose concentration consumed per initial 96 hr) on both test media.\n11. Rank Isolates in the Primary PSGHL Screen Using Relative Performance Index (RPI)\nFollowing primary screening, calculate dimensionless relative performance indices (RPI) in order to rank the 30 isolates in each of the five different experiments to screen isolates on PSGHL with two different nutrient formulations per experiment, i.e., 60% PSGHL and 75% PSGHL.\nCalculate the statistical parameter F for use in ranking isolate performance within a group of isolates tested in a given experiment: F = (X-Xavg)/s. Here, X is the performance parameter, such as yield (Y) or rate (R), observed for each individual isolate, while Xavg and s are the average and standard deviation, respectively, of X observed for all isolates within a given experiment. For normal distributions, -2 < F < 2.",
    "For each isolate in an experiment, calculate relative performance based on rate, RPIR = (2+FR) × 100/4, and similarly calculate relative performance based on yield, RPIY = (2+FY) × 100/4. The value of RPI ranges from ~0 to 100 percentile (lowest to highest). Then calculate RPI averages for each isolate within a given hydrolyzate experiment as follows: RPIavg = (RPIY +RPIR)/2, where yield and rate contributions are given equal weighting in this application.\n\tNote that in general, yield and rate parameters can be weighted if deemed unequal in importance.\nCompute RPIoverall across the n types of hydrolyzates tested: RPIoverall = Σi=1,n[(RPIY +RPIR)/2]i/n. Consider each isolate in an experimental set of 30 isolates and 2 controls. During primary ranking of the ~150 single-colony isolates adapted to xylose-rich PSGHL, the RPIoverall is calculated for rates and yields across the two PSGHL formulations applied in the screen, i.e., 60% PSGHL and 75% PSGHL, where n = 2.\nBased on RPIoverall within each experiment, choose the top percentage of isolates to pass to the secondary screen. In this example, the top 20% of strains are chosen to pass through (i.e., 30 of 150 tested).\n12. In a Secondary Screen, Compare Top Primary Screen Performers on Multiple Complete Hydrolyzates (>100 g/L Mixed Sugars) to Reveal Highest Functioning Robust Strains\nCompare top PSGHL performers on 6% glucan AFEX CSH and SGH amended with two levels of nitrogen, SGH-N1 and SGH-N2 (compositions as in Table 1) for final ranking. Screen the 30 isolates that were the top performers in the primary deep well plate screen of PSGHL (steps 10 and 11) and the two controls (parent strain NRRL Y-7124 and AFEX CSH-tolerant isolate (analogous to Colony 5, Figure 1 example).",
    "Begin cultivations by picking a bead of cells from glycerol streaks to duplicate deep wells of 1 ml ODM + 50 g/L xylose as before and incubate 48 hr in the deep well plate system (step 10.2). Then transfer 50 µl of ODM precultures to 50% SGH challenge cultures, and incubate in the deep well plate system for 72 hr to obtain A620 at ~10). Prepare the 50% SGH by mixing SGH 1:1 with sugarless ODM + 50 g/L xylose (pH 5.6).\nFor each of the isolates, inoculate a 16 ml aliquot of SGH-N1 or SGH-N2 with the cell pellet (15 min, 2,711 x g) from three wells of challenge culture to yield initial test culture A620 ~2.0. Incubate test cultures at 25 °C, 180 rpm (1\" orbit) in 25 ml flasks with silicone sponge closures. Sample flasks daily and analyze per the PSGHL screen.\nSimilarly, screen isolates as in steps 12.2 and 12.3, but this time substitute SGH-N1 and SGH-N2 with 6% glucan AFEX CSH at pH 5.2 for use in preparing the challenge culture medium and test culture medium. For the 50% strength challenge cultures, use 6% AFEX CSH diluted 1:1 with water since it is nitrogen sufficient without amendment.\nRepeat steps 12.1-12.4 to duplicate results.\n13. Rank the Performances of Isolates in the Secondary Screen Using RPI overall to Rate Use of Multiple Complete Hydrolyzates\nCalculate relative performance indices (RPI) in order to rank each of the top 20% of isolates (~30 out of 150) from the primary screen that have been tested in the secondary screen on enzyme saccharified hydrolyzate formulations of varying nutritional richness.",
    "Score each isolate tested in the secondary screen based on xylose uptake rate and ethanol yield performed on three enzyme-saccharified pretreated hydrolyzate formulations run in duplicate, including AFEX CSH (i = 1 and 2), SGH-N1 (i = 3  and 4) and SGH-N2 (i = 5 and 6).\nCalculate the RPIoverall for each isolate, and apply this ranking parameter to further winnow the list of superior isolates: RPIoverall = Σi=1,n[(RPIY +RPIR)/2]i/n, where n = 6.\n\tNOTE: Demonstrate kinetics of superior isolates in SGH-N2 hydrolyzates in flask cultures by following the procedures in Slininger et al.18\nSubscription Required.
