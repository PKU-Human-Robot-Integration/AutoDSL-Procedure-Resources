    "1. Preparation of Instruments\nTurn on the external power supply to the ammonia optical sensor platform, laser diode controller, a custom built control electronics unit (CEU), the breath sampler, air pump, and laptop.\nCheck that both the exhaust and cooling fans of the ammonia sensor are operating. NOTE: One is located in the rear of the sensor, the second is found within the sensor, which is easily accessible.\nEnsure the acoustic detection module and needle valve temperature are at 38.0 °C by checking the digital display located on the side of the ammonia sensor box. Wait approximately 35 min from the time the sensor is provided power for the temperature to stabilize.\nSet inlet tubing and mouthpiece temperature to 55 °C by clicking on an icon name “ChangeT” found on the desktop of the breath sampler. The temperature can then be changed by clicking the up or down arrow followed by clicking “Update Temp”. Click “Exit” to return to the desktop. Allow the system at least 5 min for the temperature to stabilize. Maintaining the temperature of the sampler and tubing at 55 °C minimizes the surface loss of ammonia.\nOpen the software on the laptop that controls the ammonia sensor. The program can be accessed within a folder named “NH3 Breath Sensor Program” on the desktop. Within this folder, the user must select the icon “main labview software”. This folder contains several applications, but the user must select “Mainsequence.vi” to access the desired interface. Select “run” in the top left corner of the screen. NOTE: This begins the line locking calibration sequence. The laser of the QEPAS monitor operates on an optimal current, which is selected during an automated line-locking procedure. This process will take approximately 25 min.",
    "Create a new session on the sampler such that each subject session has its own file that is saved to an attached flash drive. NOTE: This is performed by opening the program “Breath Sampler” found on the desktop of the sampler. There is space to identify the session appropriately. All data generated during the session will be saved in the flash drive under this identifier. The date of the experiment is typically used as part of the file name. The inlet and mouthpiece temperature must be adjusted before entering the breath-sampling program.\nInsert a new disposable mouthpiece into the inlet pipe. Wear disposable gloves as to avoid contaminating mouthpiece with ammonia from fingers.\n2. Breath Sample Collection\nNOTE: The relevant Institutional Review Board (Ethics Board) must approve any study that involves human subjects. There are many factors that can drastically influence breath ammonia. These factors can alter breath ammonia measurements by directly affecting systemic ammonia levels or by affecting the journey of breath metabolites from the lungs to the instrumentation.\nEnsure subjects arrive to the lab in a fasting state, having consumed no food for approximately 12 hr upon arrival and that they have refrained from exercise the morning prior to testing.\nEnsure no substance has been introduced into the mouth for at least 1 hr prior to data collection. Ensure that subjects brush their teeth greater than 1 hr before testing.\nSeat the subject in front of the ammonia sensor. Instruct the subject to hold the inlet pipe, and make sure they do not touch the mouthpiece to avoid ammonia contamination.",
    "Click “Start” on the sampler interface. Have the subject exhale into the mouthpiece for as long as they can, or until the operator deems the sample to be sufficient. NOTE: This is a single full exhalation lasting at least 10 sec. Mouth pressure is measured in real-time as a surrogate for flow rate. A color-coded pressure gauge helps the subject produce and maintain the desired exhalation pressure of 10 cm of water, which represents an exhalation flow rate of 50 ml/sec. This flow rate was selected since it has been adopted by the ATS/ERS for the protocol to determine FeNO. This exhalation flow rate is achievable by children and adults. Similarly three reproducible exhalations should be obtained that differ by less than 10%.\nClick “Stop” on the sampler interface when the breath sample is completed.\n3. Breath Sample Measurement\nOnce a breath sample has been analyzed, the laboratory technician operating the monitor then has the ability to analyze any segment of that breath profile. The portion of the breath that is of interest is the phase III segment. This is characterized by a “plateau” in the concentration of carbon dioxide and is found in the middle to late stage of the breath.\nSelect the phase III portion of the sample by dragging the vertical lines on the sampler interface to begin when carbon dioxide plateaus and stop right before the pressure drop of the breath. See Figure 1 for clarification.\nSave the data to the flash drive by clicking “Store” on the sampler touch screen interface.\nOnce the breath data have been stored, the user can select “start” to initiate a new breath sample.\n4. Illustrating the Effects of Mouth Rinse and pH on Breath Ammonia",
    "Sample 3 breaths to establish the baseline ammonia level. Ensure that breaths are taken at least 5 min apart from each other.\nRinse the mouth thoroughly with a 30 ml aliquot of water for 60 sec.\nCollect a breath sample within 60 sec of the rinse (Section 2). Collect breath samples over the course of the next hour to observe the change in ammonia over time. NOTE: Samples can be taken as frequently as every minute, but longer intervals are typically used.\nRinse mouth thoroughly with a 30 ml aliquot of basic solution (sodium bicarbonate in water) for 60 sec and repeat 4.2.1.\nRinse mouth thoroughly with a 30 ml aliquot of acidic solution for 60 sec and repeat 4.2.1.\n5. Illustrating the Effects of Inlet and Transport Tubing Temperatures on Breath Ammonia\nSample three breaths over the course of 15 min with the inlet temperature set to below body temperature, approximately 30 °C.\nIncrease the temperatures of inlet and transport tubing to 55 °C respectively using a desktop icon on the touch screen interface of the breath sampler. Allow the system at least 5 min to reach steady state.\nSample 3 breaths, 5 min apart into the heated inlet.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
