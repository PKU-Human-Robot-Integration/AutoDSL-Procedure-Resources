Due to experimental constraints, it is possible that the temporal resolution of the mRNA and protein measurements may not be identical (e.g., the mRNA sampling is performed less often than the fluorescence time-lapse imaging). If this is the case, the mRNA profile should be interpolated to obtain information on the intermediate time points. The mRNA profiles for Drosophila ColIV and Ndg was sampled with 2 h intervals starting from egg laying, and it was interpolated to obtain a data point every 2 min to match the sampling frequency of the protein. There is no theoretical limit on how different the temporal resolutions could be; however, the sampling frequency should be enough to give confidence that the interpolated curve is reflecting the observed dynamics (e.g., if two time points are too far from each other, the curve in between could take a number of shapes).\nCritical: care should be taken to align the temporal scales of both mRNA and protein data. The imaging for ColIV started at embryonic stage 15 (about 11 h 20 min after egg laying); therefore, the time was set to zero at this point for the ColIV mRNA data. The imaging for Ndg started at embryonic stage 11 (about 5 h after egg laying); therefore, the time was set to zero at this point for the Ndg mRNA data. Time zero on the two graphs in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B therefore represents two different stages of development.",
    "mRNA profile interpolation. Different software can be used to interpolate the mRNA data to increase temporal resolution; an option is detailed below using GraphPad Prism (version 8 or 9). A standard spline fitting can be chosen when the raw data have relatively even spacing between time intervals. A spline provides piece-wise polynomial fitting of a curve by dividing it in a number of segments. An increase in the number of segments and an increase in the temporal resolution of the data will increase the spline fitting quality.\nCopy time and mRNA profile data into an XY data table in Prism\nCalculate how many data points are needed in the interpolated function. In this case we want to match the experimental protein acquisition to obtain a data point every 2 min. The total available time we have ColIV and Ndg mRNA data for is −10 h to 38 h and −-4 h to 44 h, respectively (48 h = 2,880 min; time zero is the start of protein expression measurements). Therefore, we need the interpolated function on 1,441 data points (2,880/2 min + 1 data point for t = 0).\nSelect “Analyze > Fit spline/LOWESS” from the Analysis menu\nA cubic spline with 1,441 segments was chosen for this example (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B), but the parameters might need to be adjusted for different data to assure good fitting quality (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/523-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Fitting of mRNA temporal profile",
    "Spline interpolation (solid line) for ColIV (A) and Ndg (B) mRNA data, respectively, allowing to infer the intermediate data points between mRNA experimental acquisitions (circles). A poor fitting example is shown in (C): the data point at 12 h and 14 h were deleted to simulate poor fitting quality for the unsmoothed ColIV mRNA profile with the same interpolating spline function as of (A) (dash line, gray square). The data points at later time are not frequent enough to capture the curve plateau at equilibrium. A.U., arbitrary units (relative measure over time).\nCritical: check your results for overall fitting quality (see also troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]). An example of poor fitting quality for the ColIV mRNA profile is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, where the fitting does not match the expected curve shape with a peak and a plateau. The available data are too sparse at late time points to fully capture the mRNA dynamics at equilibrium (i.e., plateau). It is worth noting that acquiring the ColIV example data beyond 15 h is essential simply to make sure that the mRNA profile is reaching homeostasis around the time when we observe the protein levels also reaching equilibrium.\nProtein expression fitting. Protein expression is expected to show a logistic trend over time from initiation to homeostasis for the purpose of the present modeling (refer to step 4 of Modeling requirements[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4] for details). Logistic curves can be fully described by three parameters (Brown and Rothery, 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]): the carrying capacity K (value at infinite time), the inflection point ti (midpoint of the curve), and the intrinsic rate of increase r (steepness of the curve around ti). Logistic fitting can be achieved in GraphPad Prism as follows.\nCopy time and protein expression data into an XY data table, with one column for each experimental replicate",
    "Select “Analyze > Nonlinear regression (curve fit)” from the Analysis menu\nSelect the option “log(agonist)vs. response -- Variable slope (four parameters)” in the Dose-response – Stimulation sub-menu\nIn the Results page, check the Goodness of Fit – R squared row, to evaluate how well the data fit to a logistic curve. Values close to one signify best fitting (an average R squared of 0.99 was achieved with both sample datasets, Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B). It is not possible to state a cut-off value on the R squared parameter, and fitting quality should always be visually evaluated against the expected dynamics (i.e., curve shape).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/523-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

If protein levels are obtained by imaging of a fluorescently tagged protein, the Bottom parameter represents the residual autofluorescence. To facilitate the conversion between the GraphPad parameters and the logistic parameters an Excel workbook named 01_logistic_parameters.xlsx is provided in the Material S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/523-Mmc1.xlsx].",
    "Critical: fitting quality scores, such as R2, should be checked. If the performed fitting has low quality, it is likely that the protein does not follow a logistic behavior, or that not enough data points were obtained within the time interval of interest to fully capture the logistic trend. This could mean that the data acquisition should be adjusted (see what data do you need?[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1] and data acquisition[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]) or that the protein of interest does not meet the modeling assumptions (see modeling hypotheses[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] and limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] sections).\nAnterograde modeling\nTiming: 30 min\nRun anterograde modeling. The model in Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1] can be solved numerically for the protein expression if using the mRNA temporal profile as input (Matsubayashi et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). The synthesis and degradation rates can be obtained by minimizing the difference between the numerical solution and the experimentally measured protein levels. This is achieved by nonlinear regression (Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares algorithm, MATLAB function nlinfit); confidence intervals for the fitted parameters are also computed.\nCreate an empty folder where the analysis output will be saved\nInside the folder, create two separate csv files with the interpolated mRNA profile (step 2 of data fitting[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1]) and the fitted logistic parameters for the protein profile (step 3 of data fitting[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1]). The first file should include two columns, one for time and one for mRNA values, and the number of rows will depend on the chosen time steps and interval; the second file should include three rows (K, ti, r) and one column for each biological replicate (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). The number of biological replicates to include ultimately depends on the biological and experimental variability in the system used. In this example, due to small discrepancies in embryo staging and possible fluctuations in room temperature (24°C–25°C), 10 ColIV and 6 Ndg samples were deemed sufficient.",

Structure of input and output files\nSchematic of the required input (A) and the obtained output files (B).\nIn MATLAB, open the file called anterograde_model.m and hit Run. The code will request you to locate the two files you created and to choose the time interval and span of your experiments (in the case of the sample data, Time interval [min] = 2 and “Starting time experiment [h]” and “Finishing time experiment [h]” were chosen equal to 0 and 15 for ColIV and to 0 and 20 for Ndg, respectively).\nThe code will produce four output csv files, containing the values for the synthesis and degradation rates and their confidence intervals (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Each row represents a biological replicate.\nCritical: the confidence intervals should be checked in order to verify good fitting of the model. These values are expected to be much smaller than the biological variability between replicates (see also troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7]).\nRetrograde modeling\nTiming: 30 min\nRun retrograde modeling. The model in Equation 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd1] can be solved analytically for the mRNA profile if using the logistic curve fitted to the experimentally measured protein expression as input (Matsubayashi et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). The synthesis and degradation rates can be obtained by minimizing the difference between the analytical solution and the experimentally obtained mRNA profiles. This is achieved with the same nonlinear regression algorithm of the anterograde case; confidence intervals for the fitted parameters are computed.\nCreate an empty folder where the analysis output will be saved\nCopy in the newly created folder the two csv files created at step 4b of Anterograde modeling[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.2]",
    "In MATLAB, navigate to the folder where the code was saved. Open the file called retrograde_model.m and hit Run.

Each row represents a biological replicate.\nCritical: this step represents a control for the internal consistency of the modeling, as the synthesis and degradation rates for anterograde and retrograde should be similar. If this is not the case, this is the third warning sign that the modeling might not be sufficient for the protein of interest (see the limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] section). In the case of the test data, this condition is satisfied, as the calculated turnover rates do not show statistical difference when comparing anterograde and retrograde modeling (Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, level of significance set to 0.01, for both ColIV and Ndg, Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/523-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

Please note that this is an arbitrary choice, the degradation rates from the retrograde model could be used and should lead to similar results as internal consistency between the two modeling approaches is expected. The test data show an average protein half-life of about 6 h for ColIV and about 14 h for Ndg."
