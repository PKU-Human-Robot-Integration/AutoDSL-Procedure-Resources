    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nLoad Cells with Calcein\nTiming: 90 min\nIn this step, cells are loaded with calcein-AM, which they will metabolize to calcein. Calcein fluorescence is quenched by protein in a concentration-dependent manner and can therefore be used as a probe of protein concentration. On short timescales during which the number of intracellular protein molecules is constant, calcein fluorescence can therefore be used as a probe of cell volume. At higher concentrations (in the mM range), calcein is known to self-quench. At the concentrations used here (μM loading concentrations leading to nM intracellular free calcein concentrations (Solenov et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])), self-quenching does not occur, and the observed fluorescence changes are caused by protein-dependent quenching.\nPrepare calcein-AM loading medium by taking pre-warmed full cell culture medium and adding probenecid to a final concentration of 1 mM (from a 175 mM stock in 200 mM NaOH), and calcein-AM to a final concentration of 5 μM (from a 5 mM DMSO stock). The non-fluorescent, membrane-permeable calcein-AM will be metabolized to fluorescent non-membrane-permeable calcein by intracellular esterases.\nRemove all culture medium from cells and add 100 μL of calcein-AM loading medium per well. For speed and reproducibility, we recommend use of a multichannel pipette where possible. Return cells to the incubator at 37°C for 90 min. During this 90 min incubation, switch on the plate reader and set the internal temperature to 37°C. How soon into the 90 min this needs to be done will depend on the specific plate-reader model, and how quickly it heats up. The experimenter should check this beforehand.",
    "Note: In some cell types, (e.g., some neuronal cells), calcein can be sequestered in intracellular organelles (Crowe et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Kovacs et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). This may lead to artifacts in the measurements described here. This can be checked by observing calcein-loaded cells under a fluorescence microscope; in order for this protocol to be used, the calcein fluorescence should be uniformly distributed through the cytoplasm.\nWash Cells and Prepare Hypertonic Medium\nTiming: 20 min\nIn this step, the calcein-AM loading medium is removed, the cells are washed to remove residual calcein-AM, and the hypertonic medium used to induce cell shrinkage is prepared.\nPrepare washing medium by taking pre-warmed HEPES-buffered full cell culture medium and adding probenecid to a final concentration of 1 mM. HEPES-buffered variants of most cell culture medium formulations are available from a variety of suppliers. For example, for cells cultured in DMEM, we would use HEPES-buffered DMEM (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich D1152). A full 96-well plate will require 275 × 96 6 = 26,400 μL (26.4 mL). This can be rounded up to 30 mL for simplicity and to allow for pipetting losses. Wash cells twice by removing all medium and replacing with 100 μL of washing medium. On the third wash, replace with 75 μL of washing medium. Return cells to the incubator for at least 10 min to equilibrate with the new medium. An alternative to using HEPES-buffered medium in this step is to use standard bicarbonate-buffered medium and a plate reader with environmental gas control set to 5% CO2. Bicarbonate buffer requires CO2 control, whereas HEPES buffer does not.",
    "Prepare hypertonic D-mannitol medium by dissolving D-mannitol powder directly in washing medium (full HEPES-buffered culture medium + probenecid) to give a final concentration of 400 mM. Sterilize using a 0.2 μm filter. We recommend preparing at least 10 mL more than is required, to prevent the formation of bubbles in the injector tubing toward the end of the experiment. For example, 1 full 96-well plate will require 75 × 96 = 7,200 μL (7.2 mL), therefore 17.2 mL should be prepared. This could be rounded up to 20 mL for simplicity. The D-mannitol concentration (and the osmotic gradient used in the experiment) can be checked using a freezing point depression osmometer. The D-mannitol medium should have an osmolality 400 mOsm higher than the mannitol-free washing medium, which will give an osmotic gradient of 200 mOsm when mixed 1:1 with mannitol-free medium in the next step of the protocol.\nPrime the plate-reader injector system with the hypertonic D-mannitol medium. To maintain the temperature of this solution, it can be stored in a heating block or water bath set to 37°C or placed inside the plate-reader housing (depending on the model).\nAlternatives: The experimenter should consider whether D-mannitol is an appropriate non-permeant solute for their cell type and experiment. There is evidence that some membrane channels, such as mammalian AQP9 (Tsukaguchi et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) are mannitol permeable. If the cells of interest may express such a channel, alternative solutes should be considered, e.g., sucrose.",
    "Note: Other similar protocols recommend the use of phenol red-free cell culture medium for experiments with calcein-AM. We find that the absorbance and fluorescence of phenol red in standard cell culture medium at the wavelengths in question (ex: 485 nm, em: 525 nm) is negligible. We therefore use standard culture medium with phenol red. If the experimenter wishes to convince themselves of this, they can use a phenol red-free washing medium and compare the fluorescence intensity between wells of calcein-AM-loaded cells in standard medium and phenol red-free medium. In our hands, using bottom optics, they are indistinguishable.\nNote: The incubation times for steps with probenecid are 90 min for the calcein loading, and 10 min for the post-loading equilibration.\nMeasure Water Permeability\nTiming: 1–90 min\nIn this step, calcein fluorescence is measured continuously following injection of hypertonic medium. Cell shrinkage will lead to calcein fluorescence quenching.\nRemove the cells from the incubator, remove the lid from the cell culture plate, and insert the plate into the pre-warmed plate reader. Set the plate reader to read each well for 5 s, followed by injection of 75 μL hypertonic D-mannitol medium at a speed of 300 μL/s (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for further discussion of injection speed), and a further 50 s of continuous reading, with a read interval of 50 ms using bottom optics. If the cells of interest have especially high or especially low water permeability, the length of the second read step can be increased or decreased from 50 s.",
    "Critical: For accurate quantification of the cell shrinkage constant, it is important that the fluorescence intensity should reach a plateau by the end of this reading step. If the fluorescence begins to recover before the end of this step (regulatory volume increase), it is important in the analysis steps to only fit to the data up to the plateau, and not include the recovery. If the fluorescence begins to recover before the end of the shrinking phase, the cell type used will not be suitable for this protocol.\nNote: The plate can be left to run at this point. A full 96-well plate will take 96 x 55 s (88 min).\nCritical: In our plate-reader setup, during this time we do not observe any significant evaporation of medium from the unlidded plate. However, it is crucial that the experimenter checks this in their setup, as water evaporation will concentrate extracellular solutes, change the starting cell volume, and change the actual osmotic gradient that is applied. This can be done by leaving an unlidded plate with culture medium in the plate reader for the required amount of time (e.g., 88 min for a full plate read), then checking medium volume visually by aspiration into a micropipette tip, and by checking the osmolality on a freezing point depression osmometer."
