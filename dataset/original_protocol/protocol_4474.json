    "A. tumefaciens-mediated transient transformation of N. benthamiana Culture bacterial strains carrying the constructs of choice in 5 ml liquid LB under appropriate antibiotic selection overnight (ON) at 28 °C.Harvest bacteria by centrifugation in 2 ml reaction tubes at 6,500 x g and resuspend in infiltration solution. For pUbi-YFP constructs use a final OD600 of 0.01 and for pAM-PAT-35S-CFP/YFP constructs use a final OD600 of 0.2-0.4. To improve expression, add an A. tumefaciens Agl1 strain containing a construct mediating expression of the viral silencing inhibitor P19 (Voinnet et al., 2003) to each sample at a final OD600 of 0.1. Excess presence of the same type of RNA may cause RNA degradation by the plant as part of the immune response to a putative viral infection. P19 helps to reduce such RNA degradation.Incubate the solution for 2 h in the dark at room temperature (RT).Subsequently syringe-infiltrate the youngest fully expanded leaves with the individual samples using a 1 ml syringe (as demonstrated in Video 1). The infiltrated area will be clearly visible. Use sufficient infiltration solution to cover sufficient leave area for later imaging (usually 100-300 µl).    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Infiltration of Agrobacterium tumefaciens into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves  Continue plant growth for 2 days prior to imaging. Water plants moderately. The time between infiltration and imaging strongly depends on the type of protein (e.g. solubility of transmembrane), the used promoters and the growth conditions of the N. benthamiana plants.A. tumefaciens-mediated transient transformation of A. thaliana 24 h prior to infiltration, spray five to six weeks old plants grown under short-day conditions with the 2 μM DEX solution containing 0.04% Silwett-77. Spray under fume hood to prevent inhalation of Silwet-77. Turn plants multiple times and ensure leaves are completely covered by a thin film of liquid until drip-of.",
    "In case of drops forming on the leave surface with the liquid not spreading to make a film, slightly increase the Silwett-77 concentration.Prepare the infiltration solution containing A. tumefaciens strains of your choice as described for transformation of N. benthamiana above.Subsequently syringe-infiltrate the youngest fully expanded leaves with the individual samples using a 1 ml syringe (see Video 1 for the corresponding infiltration procedure in N. benthamiana). The infiltrated area will be clearly visible. Use sufficient infiltration solution to cover sufficient leave area for later imaging (usually 100-300 µl).Grow plants for 2 days for imaging, water moderately.Sample preparation for image acquisitionFor microscopic analysis, cut leaf discs from infiltrated areas using biopsy punches or cork borers.Prepare cover glasses with drops of water.Mount lower side of the leaf on cover slips on top of water drops, make sure there is no air between leaf tissue and glass.Add microscope slides and image directly.Image acquisitionIn transiently expressing systems, choose lowly expressing cells. To be able to differentiate between autofluorescence and real fluorophore signal, choose a non-infiltrated cell area and adjust imaging settings in order to eliminate background. Use these setting to search for cells displaying non-saturating intensities. In an 8-bit greyscale image these values should ideally not exceed 100 (out of 255 possible grey levels). For stably expressing system, use lines, if possible, expressing your protein of interest under control of its native promoter (ideally in a mutant background). Select lines where expression of the transgene is similar to levels of the endogenous transcript (e.g. by quantitative Real Time PCR) or compare protein levels if an antibody against the endogenous protein is available.For single pictures of PM surfaces, use 2 line averages per frame.",
    "For co-localization experiments (especially when using fluorophores with partially overlapping excitation/emission spectra), use the microscope in the sequential scanning mode to avoid ‘bleed-through’ between the channels.Export images as .tif files for further processing or use original microscope files if readable by the processing software.To be able to compare images, make sure settings are identical between different takes (e.g. laser intensity, gain, offset, scan speed,  etc.…)Image processingQuantitative analysis of subcellular single protein localization: The analysis includes the creation of a mask, which will be overlaid with the original image for measurements.Open individual pictures of single infiltrations in Fiji.If necessary, change properties according to your image setting (adjust pixel and voxel size).Change Image → Type to 8-bit.Image → Duplicate image and continue working on the duplicated image.Run Process → Filters → Mean filter of 2 pixels.Subject to Process → Subtract background choosing a rolling ball radius of 20 pixels (be aware that background subtraction is critical and should be carefully evaluated prior to application. E. g. measure the size of the objects you are interested in and make sure the radius you chose is significantly bigger than your biggest object!).Image → Adjust → Threshold to segment the image in foreground and background, try this for a number of different images and then decide on a default setting to process all images you want to compare.Process → Binary → Convert to mask.Process → Binary → Create a binary image.In case of overlapping regions of interest, apply Plugins → Watershed.Choose Analyze → Set measurements and define which parameters you would like to analyze, tick “add to Roi manager”.Analyze particles (the output will be a table including all parameters previously defined in the “Set measurements” menu).Select the original image, click “Show all” and “Measure” in the ROI manager.",
    "The original image will show all regions selected by the mask for measurements, the table will now include a second set of measurements for the original image.To perform statistical analysis on the results we recommend R using ANOVA and Tukey’s honestly significant difference."
