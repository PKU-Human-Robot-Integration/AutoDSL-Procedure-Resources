    "Note: All steps are performed under a cell culture hood, using aseptic techniques. Well plate preparation (Day 1-2)Day 1Place 300 µl of poly-L-lysine 1 mg/ml in all wells of the 24 well plate. Poly-L-lysine is an attachment factor, which improves cell adherence.Incubate over night at room temperature.Day 2, before part BRemove the poly-L-lysine.Rinse 2 times (quickly), then rinse for 1 h and finish with 2 rinses (quickly) with sterile water.Add 1.5 ml of the first culture medium per well.Place the plate in the incubator until step B9.Hippocampal neurons preparation (Day 2)Remove hippocampi from the embryo brain in 1x HBSS using the pliers and the microscope, Figure 1 [see Figure 1A-F in the article of Fuller and Dailey (Fuller and Dailey, 2007)].Place hippocampi in a tube with 4.5 ml of 1x HBSS.Add 500 µl of 10x trypsin.Incubate in a water bath at 37 °C (98.6 °F) for 15 min.Rinse 3 times with 1x HBSS leaving the tissue at the bottom of the tube. Add 500 µl of the first culture medium.Using a P1000 pipette with a P1000 cone and a P200 cone, perform the mechanical dissociation (Figure 2) by sucking and spitting several times the cone content with the pipette. During this step, be careful not to create air bubbles in the medium (air bubbles are toxic for neurons).Wait a few minutes until the aggregate settles to the bottom of the tube.Transfer supernatant containing dispersed cells to a sterile Eppendorf tube. Leave ~25 µl of culture medium containing aggregate.With a Neubauer or Malassez cell counting chamber, count the number of cells and adjust to a number of 2.2 x 105 cells per well. Usually, there are around 1 x 106 hippocampal cells per embryo, so one embryo can be used to fill 5 wells approximately.",
    "Place in the incubator for 2 h.Replace the first culture medium by the second culture medium (1.5 ml per well). Place in the incubator for 2 days (until part C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150103/20150103193947_4693.jpgFigure 2. Mechanical dissociation using a P1000 pipette with a P1000 cone and a P200 coneAddition of MnCl2 in the medium culture (Day 4)In this protocol, 5 dilutions of MnCl2 are studied: 0, 20, 50, 100 and 150 µM. Replace the culture medium by the Mn solutions at different concentrations and place the plate in the incubator for 24 h.MTT assay (Day 5)MTT assay is a fast method for the enumeration of living cells. The tetrazolium salt (yellow) is reduced into formazan by the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase of living cells. This reaction creates a purple precipitate.Prepare fresh MTT solutions 5 mg/ml.Remove the culture medium and add 500 µl of MTT 0.5 mg/ml diluted in the second medium culture.Incubate the plate for 2 h at 37 °C.Induce cell lysis by replacing MTT solution by 500 µl of pure DMSO. Cells will liberate the purple precipitate formed by mitochondria of living cells.Using a P1000 pipette, help cell lysis by sucking and spitting several times with the pipette.Detach the last cells still attached to the plate with a cell scraper.Transfer the lysate into an Eppendorf tube.Take 200 µl of each lysate and place them in a 96 well plate.Fill one well with 200 µl of pure DMSO for reference. The optic density of this reference-which contains 0 cells-will be subtracted from the other optic densities.Using the spectrophotometer, read the optic density of each well filled with the lysate using a wavelength = 519 nm. An absorbance inferior to 1 is necessary to respect the law of Beer Lambert. If the absorbance is above 1, the lysate must be diluted in pure DMSO.",
    "The typical absorbance for a culture of 2.2 x 105 neurons at Day 5 is 0.93 ± 0.09. The well without Mn is considered to contain 100% of living cells. You can then compute the fraction of living cells in the other wells from the ratio between the optic density in the wells and the optic density in the well without Mn."
