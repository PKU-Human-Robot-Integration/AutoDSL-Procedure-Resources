    "1. General protocol guidelines\nMaintain the microscope on an air table or at a minimum on a vibration-free table. Ensure that extraneous vibrations (e.g., foot tapping on the floor, touching the table, door closures, laboratory traffic) are kept to a minimum.\nSet and maintain the temperature of the laser module at a constant temperature for all video recordings.\n\tNOTE: The temperature chosen was 25 °C because the nanoparticle size analyzer was calibrated at that temperature. Therefore, it is important that all users of the instrument know and use the calibrated temperature. Room temperature is not an acceptable setting because it can vary.\nEnsure that all diluents, also called negative controls (e.g., Dulbecco's Phosphate-buffered Saline (DPBS), ultrapure distilled water [DW]), are all NTA-characterized using the same camera level and detection threshold as the nanoparticle samples being measured. Use characterized DPBS for the flushing of the laser module and dilution of samples. Factor contaminants in the negative control DPBS into sample results if their levels are significant.\nStore samples at 4 °C prior to evaluation and never freeze them as this would degrade the liposome sample. Warm samples/standards/diluents to room temperature for 30 min prior to analysis.\n\tNOTE: Sample handling was specific to the material being examined.\nEvaluate sample and standards using Quick measurement to establish an appropriate dilution to obtain 107 to 109 particles/mL (approximately 50 to 100 particles/NTA video screen) determined to be optimal for NTA analyses.\n\tNOTE: The authors have found that particle concentrations at the higher end of this range produce more consistent and reproducible results.\nFill in all applicable fields within the Capture box of the SOP tab for both Quick and Standard measurements, including the dilution and diluent used.\n2. Preparation of 50 nm and 100 nm size calibration standards\nNOTE: See the Table of Materials.",
    "50 nm size Transfer Standards diluted 1:5,000\n\t\nAdd 2 µL of the 50 nm standards to 9,998 µL of 0.22 µm-filtered 10 mM potassium chloride (KCl)/0.03% Tween 20 in ultrapure DW into a twice-rinsed 15 mL conical tube. Store the diluted 50 nm standard at 4 °C for up to a year.\n100 nm size Transfer Standards diluted 1:333\n\t\nAdd 30 µL of the 100 nm standards to 9,970 µL of 0.22 µm-filtered 10 mM KCl/0.03% Tween 20 in ultrapure DW into a twice-rinsed 15 mL conical tube. Store the diluted 100 nm standard at 4 °C for up to a year.\n3. Cleaning and assembly of the laser module\nVisually inspect the laser module and flow-cell cover windows for scratches or imperfections.\n\tNOTE: If either glass surface is scratched, imaging may be affected.\nClean both glass surfaces gently with a good quality lens cleaner and lens paper. Do not use tissue wipes or paper towels on glass surfaces.\nEnsure that the O-ring seal is properly seated in the groove of the flow-cell cover prior to assembly.\nPlace the flow-cell cover on the laser module, ensuring the electrical contacts are in the proper orientation. Place the 4 spring-loaded thumbscrews through the flow-cell plate and engage the threads of the laser module but do not tighten individually.\nPutting uniform pressure down on the flow-cell cover, uniformly tighten the thumbscrews in an alternating diagonal manner until snug. Only tighten the thumbscrews until finger-tight. Do not overtighten.\n\tNOTE: Uneven tightening of the thumbscrews can crack the laser module surface. Newer-designed thumbscrews will \"bottom out\" at the proper pressure, avoiding possible overtightening.\n4. Flushing procedure for the laser module prior to and between samples",
    "Use a newly opened container of DPBS and aliquot into triple-rinsed 15 mL polypropylene tubes. Ensure that products used to flush or dilute samples are NTA-characterized prior to use (see step 1.3).\nFlush two 1 mL tuberculin syringes with slip lock adaptors 3 times with 1 mL of DPBS to remove any particulate residues. Use either port as the input but use it consistently during the experiment. Do not use larger syringes due to the danger of breaking syringe ports from the increased weight and size of the syringe.\nRemove and discard the plunger from the 1st tuberculin syringe and insert it into the remaining port to serve as a voided diluent/sample reservoir.\n\tNOTE: Failure to remove the plunger will cause increased pressure in the sample chamber and leakage around the seal.\nFill the 2nd syringe with 1 mL of DPBS and attach it to the inlet port of the flow-cell cover.\nHold the laser module tilted with the outlet syringe port elevated to allow air to be purged from the chamber as the DPBS is injected slowly into the laser module.\nFlush the remaining DPBS from the laser module by injecting 1 mL of air into the inlet port. Repeat flushing 2 more times.\nEmpty the laser module as completely as possible after the last flush.\n\t​NOTE: Thorough, careful flushing is necessary following NTA analysis of the 50 nm standard, as these particles persist in the laser module. The laser module is now ready to be used.\n5. Placement of the laser module on the microscope stage\nLocate the laser module focus alignment guides on the arm of the microscope (Figure 2) and align them using the focus knob.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63059/63059fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Laser module focus alignment guide. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63059/63059fig02large.jpg]",
    "Facing the microscope, place the laser module in the grooved stage and gently slide it as far as possible to the right.\n\tNOTE: If done carefully, the alignment and focal spot will be easier to locate between samples.\nTurn on the rocker switch on the laser control box.\n6. Focusing and positioning of the laser module\nNOTE: This must be performed with fluid in the chamber.\nLoad the NTA software (see the Table of Materials) from the desktop.\n\tNOTE: An error may appear, \"Temperature H/W not found on COM3.\" Simply close and reopen the software to fix it.\nClick Start Camera under the Capture tab in the upper left corner box. If the camera shuts off automatically after 5 min, simply click Start Camera again to restart it.\nIn the same tab, adjust Camera Level to 14 to 16 to brighten the laser line and simplify particle identification and focus.\nDivert the image from the camera to the eyepieces by moving the top slider on the left side of the headpiece in or out.\nFind the area of increased density, commonly referred to as the thumbprint. Center and focus the thumbprint vertically in the field of view.\n\tNOTE: The laser line will be to the left of the thumbprint. Darkening the room may help facilitate locating the thumbprint and focusing on the laser line.\nCenter the laser line in the field of view; move the top slider to divert light to the camera as observed on the computer screen.\n\tNOTE: The laser line now visible on the screen is a mirror image of the eyepiece view; left in the eyepieces will be right on the computer screen.\nAdjust the focus to sharpen the image of individual moving particles on the screen with the focus knob.",
    "NOTE: Due to the depth of focus, all the particles will not be in focus, which is acceptable. Even particles that are slightly out of focus will be captured by the camera and analyzed by the software.\n7. Loading standards/samples/diluent into the laser module for NTA analysis\nDraw up 1 mL of standard/sample/diluent into a rinsed 1 mL tuberculin syringe and attach it to the inlet port of the flow-cell cover. Advance the plunger until fluid is evident in the open syringe attached to the outlet port.\nIn the camera view, move to the right of the laser line to an area of a uniform number of particles. If necessary, adjust the vertical orientation to center the horizontal bands of light. Refocus until the highest number of particles are in view. Ensure that for all subsequent measures, this position is maintained as closely as possible.\nAdjust the Camera Level to the point that the Dark information symbol flashes intermittently on and off in the top right of the camera view.\n\tNOTE: This helps ensure that a consistent camera level selection is made at the minimum sensitivity level for each data collection series.\n\tNOTE: Camera Level cannot be changed during capture.\n8. Validation of calibration",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to validate the module calibration using size standards (see section 2) prior to sample analysis. Routine validation is necessary to ensure accurate measurements. In a multiuser laboratory, individual user adjustments of software configuration settings can inadvertently cause inaccurate data collection. For critical data collection, daily validation is a matter of good laboratory practice. The day-to-day reproducibility of validation needs to be included in the reported results. Typically, calibration is set by the technician and is not adjustable by the individual user unless the user has administrator access. This prevents unauthorized reconfiguration by individual users.\nWarm diluted standards (see section 2) to room temperature for 30 min.\nBriefly vortex the standards and then load as described in section 7.\nPerform sample NTA as described in section 10 and record values for subsequent calculation of the coefficient of variation, which should be less than 2% if correctly calibrated.\n9. Optimizing sample concentration for NTA\nNOTE: The screen should contain between 50 and 100 measurable particles when the camera level and sample concentration are adjusted properly. If there is any question about whether a sample has an appropriate particle number, a Quick Measurement can be run on the sample at this point (see steps 9.1 to 9.7). It is used to assess the sample characteristics rapidly prior to longer video captures. The Quick Measurement tab is found within the SOP tab in the bottom middle box.\nSet Capture duration to 30 s.\nAccept the existing base filename or enter a new filename by clicking the ... tab for a new storage site for generated data.\nCheck the box for Target temperature and input the desired temperature.\nLoad the sample as previously described (step 7.1) and click Create and Run Script.",
    "Wait for the number of particles per frame to be displayed on the bottom right of the video screen after the completion of the 30 s video. If the number of particles is greater than 100, flush the laser module 3 times (as previously described in step 4.6).\nDilute the sample to the desired concentration range using the characterized diluent.\nLoad the properly diluted sample into the flushed laser module and run the Quick Measurement to verify the sample is within the acceptable range.\n10. Sample NTA\nNOTE: The Standard Measurement tab is within the SOP tab in the bottom middle box and is used for routine sample analysis (see steps 10.1 to 10.12).\nSet the duration to 30 or 60 s and the number of videos to 5.\nAccept the existing base filename or enter a new filename by clicking the ... tab for a new storage site for generated data.\nCheck the box for Target temperature and input the desired temperature.\nClick Create Script to reuse this Standard Measurement.\nOnce the sample is loaded as described in section 7 and the experiment is ready to run, click Create and Run Script.\nFill out the fields in the Set Report Details popup screen with information on the operator, sample description, dilution of the sample, and diluent used.\n\tNOTE: This information will be recorded and printed on the final experimental report.\nWhen all desired fields have been filled, click OK to initiate the script.\n\tNOTE: If Target temperature was selected, the heater will stabilize the sample in the laser module to the desired temperature for 5 s prior to allowing the script to proceed with the measurement. The diagnostic panel in the lower-left corner of the screen will read HEATER ON and display the temperature of the sample.",
    "Prior to each video capture, look for a prompt to Advance the plunger manually. Inject ~0.05 mL of the sample into the laser chamber and allow the particles to come to \"rest\" (i.e., not flowing), and then click OK.\nWait for a Settings Confirmation box to appear upon the completion of the 5th video capture and for the Process box to flash. Set the Detection Threshold for processing of the sample by noting the number of blue crosses marking particles on the screen as the frames are advanced manually from the bottom of the video screen. If there are more than 3-4 blue crosses marking particles on each screen as frames are advanced, increase the Detection Threshold.\n\tNOTE: The blue crosses on the individual particles are analogous to the \"swarm\" effect in flow cytometry and should be minimized for optimum accuracy and reproducibility of data collection.\nClick Settings OK when the Detection Threshold is acceptable.\nWait for the videos to be automatically processed and a histogram of results and a dialog box notification of completion to be displayed before clicking OK.\nOnce the Export Settings box appears, save the results by clicking Export.\n\tNOTE: All results from videos and analysis will be stored in the destination file defined in step 10.2. This requires a large amount of storage. Monitor and transfer to a secondary storage device as necessary.\n11. Re-analysis of the current sample at different detection thresholds\nNOTE: Immediately following NTA analysis (step 10), the data can be reanalyzed using different Detection Threshold settings. However, Camera Level cannot be modified following capture.\nHighlight all 5 of the capture videos listed in the Current Experiment.\nClick Process Selected Files, and wait for the Setting Confirmation box to appear and the Process box to flash to change Detection Threshold.",
    "Adjust the Detection Threshold to the desired level and click Setting OK.\nWait for the videos to be automatically processed and a histogram of results and a dialog box notification of completion to be displayed before clicking OK.\nClick Export Settings. When additional evaluations are performed on the most recent sample, be sure to click the Export Results box in the Current Experiment as the Export Results popup box will not be displayed following the sample re-analysis.\n\tNOTE: As there are no reminders to do this, it can easily be overlooked, and the analysis will be lost. However, the underlying data will remain and can be reanalyzed later.\n12. Analysis of archived files\nNOTE: If previously analyzed experiments have not been saved or additional analysis needs to be done on these samples, the individual files can be reloaded into the NTA software for additional Detection Threshold evaluations. Camera Level changes cannot be modified following capture.\nLoad the NTA software from the desktop.\nClick the Analysis tab in the lower middle panel.\nClick Open Experiment and navigate to the desired .nano file.\n\tNOTE: The video files associated with the selected .nano experiment must be in the same folder as the main experiment file; otherwise, an error will appear when trying to process the files. The first 6 digits of the filename are the date the experiment was run (xx-xx-xx). The last 6 digits of the filename are the time the video was recorded (xx-xx-xx) and the individual video identifier. The PDF file of each combined experiment lists the included .nano files for that analysis.\nClick Process Selected Files to run the analysis.\nOnce the Process box flashes to allow changes in Detection Threshold, set the threshold to the desired level and click OK.",
    "Wait for the videos to be automatically processed and a histogram of results and a dialog box notification of completion to be displayed before clicking OK.\nClick Export Results. Be sure to click the Export Results box in the Current Experiment, as the Export Results popup box will not be displayed following the re-analysis.\n\tNOTE: As there are no reminders to do this, it can easily be overlooked, and the analysis will be lost.\n13. Cleaning and disassembly of the laser module\nTurn off the laser control box.\nFlush the entire sample from the laser module and discard it properly.\nHold the laser module tilted with the open syringe port elevated to allow air to be purged from the chamber as the DPBS is injected slowly into the laser module and is flushed from the outlet syringe port.\nFlush the remaining DPBS from the laser module and discard.\nRepeat flushing 2 more times and empty the laser module as completely as possible after the last flush.\nPutting uniform pressure down on the flow-cell cover, uniformly loosen thumbscrews in an alternating diagonal manner until disengaged from threads, remove the thumbscrews, and store in the laser module case.\nRemove the flow-cell cover from the laser module.\nClean both glass surfaces gently with a good quality lens cleaner and lens paper. Do not use tissue paper or paper towels on glass surfaces.\nVisually inspect the laser module and flow-cell cover \"windows\" for scratches or imperfections following use and report to the supervisor.\nReplace the laser module and flow-cell cover in their cases to prevent damage to glass surfaces during storage.\n14. Sample analysis protocol\nUnfiltered samples",
    "Vortex the sample prior to loading and record 5 x 60 s videos at Camera Level 12 and Detection Threshold Level 3 as described above. Reanalyze these videos using Detection Thresholds 2 and 5.\nRepeat video collections of the same sample at Camera Levels 13 and 14 and Detection Threshold Level 3. Reanalyze these 2 additional videos using Detection Thresholds 2 and 5. Repeat the entire process using 5 x 30 s videos in the SOP setting.\nFiltered samples\n\t\nVortex the sample and then simultaneously load and filter it (0.22 µm syringe filter) directly into the laser module.\n\t\tNOTE: The syringe filter was flushed with 2 times the volume of the filter dead space prior to use to remove any resident particulates. The syringe filters (see the Table of Materials) had a measured dead space of 0.5 mL and were flushed with 1.0 mL of the sample prior to measurements. Note the filter type in the SOP data fields. The filtered sample was processed exactly as described for unfiltered samples in step 14.1.\n15. Statistical analysis of NTA results\nFor the analysis of main effects or interactions, perform analysis of variance following a check of ANOVA assumptions (normality, unimodal, homogeneity of variance). Use Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks in cases of failure of ANOVA assumptions.\nFollowing the return of significant main effects, use Dunn's method to perform means testing for preplanned comparisons. Consider a p-value of 0.05 to be significant in two-tailed testing.\n\tNOTE: Data files generated here are available from the authors following the completion of a materials transfer agreement.\nSubscription Required.
