    "Note: All experiments are performed during the light phase (between 09:00 and 16:00) under fluorescent overhead lighting. Setting up the apparatusRemove the bottle caps from the four bottles, and use the drill and screws to secure the caps to the bottom of the storage bin with the open side facing up. Place one cap in each of the four quadrants as shown in Figure 1A.Handling and habituating the rats to the experimenter and testing apparatusFor 2 days prior to testing, rats should be handled for 5 min each day by the experimenter. Each rat should also spend 5 min on each day in the empty apparatus (with bed-o-cobs covering the floor and four bottle caps) to habituate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190414/20190414183805_0243.jpgFigure 1.

Familiarization and delay period (Figure 2)Turn on video camera positioned above testing apparatus.Twist to secure bottles onto two of the caps in one of the familiarization configurations (Figure 1B). Be sure to counterbalance configurations across rats. Sprinkle bed-o-cobs around the bottom of the apparatus covering all of the bottle caps.Start the video recording.Hold testing sheet in front of camera listing the rat number and “familiarization”.Place the rat into the apparatus and start the timer for 15 min.After 15 min, stop the recording, return the rat to the home cage, and write down the time on a testing sheet. The test time for the rat will be the current time + 3 h (delay). Spray the stimuli with 70% ethanol and let them dry. Remove any feces from the apparatus.Start the next rat using the same procedure (b-h above).",
    "TestingWhen a rat is ready for testing (3 h after the familiarization phase), secure the bottles onto two of the caps in one of the test configurations (Figure 1C). Be sure to counterbalance configurations across rats. Make sure bed-o-cobs are still covering the bottle caps.Start the video recording, and hold the testing sheet in front of the camera listing the rat number and “test”.Place the rat into the apparatus and start the timer for 15 min.After 15 min, stop the recording, return the rat to the home cage, and spray the stimuli with 70% ethanol.Continue this procedure (a-d) until all rats have been tested. Move the video files over to the computer, and turn off the camera. Video 1 illustrates a typical DOR familiarization trial for two rats tested in adjacent testing bins.Note: All testing intervals and timings are based on previous data using the Novel Object Recognition task. Familiarization and testing lengths of 15-min allow enough time for the animal to explore the objects. The three-hour delay interval has been used successfully to show a hippocampal-dependent memory effect using the Novel Object Recognition task previously (Broadbent et al., 2010). Shorter time delays may not show hippocampal dependency, and longer time delays can lead to weaker memories in control animals. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190414/20190414183830_8194.jpgFigure 2.
