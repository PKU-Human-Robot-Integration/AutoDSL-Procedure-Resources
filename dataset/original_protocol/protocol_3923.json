    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConjugation of peptides with BSA\nTiming: 2 days\nTo efficiently immobilize the peptide on the substrate slide, the peptides are conjugated to a large carrier protein. Here we used BSA as the carrier. Other protein can be used. However, the protein may bring non-specific binding so as to generate high background or false positive signals. One strategy to lower this effect is that the carrier protein is added into the Blocking buffer and serum Incubation buffer.\nReconstitute the lyophilized peptides with double distilled water (ddH2O) to 4 mg/mL. Notably, for hydrophobic peptides which is difficult to be dissolved with water, DMSO (20 μL) could be added to 1 mg peptide followed by adding 230 μL ddH2O. However, a few peptides that still cannot be completely dissolved would have a compromised concentration.\nBSA activation by Sulfo-SMCC.\nDissolve 10 mg BSA with 2.5 mL 1 × PBS (phosphate buffer saline).\nDissolve 2 mg Sulfo-SMCC with 100 μL ddH2O and pipette up and down to mix to generate homogenous solution.\nAdd 97.7 μL dissolved Sulfo-SMCC into the BSA solution, gently shake and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (22°C–27°C).\nNote: The molar ratio of BSA to Sulfo-SMCC is 1: 30.\nDialyze in 1 × PBS at 4°C to remove the excess Sulfo-SMCC. The dialysis buffer (1 × PBS) should be changed at least twice after 3–4 h of dialysis each.\nPeptide conjugation.\nAdd 250 μL activated BSA to 1 mg reconstituted peptides (1:1 in w/w).\nIncubate at room temperature (22°C–27°C) for 4 h on a rotator.\nOptional: Conjugation efficiency can be estimated by electrophoresis separation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). It is highly recommended particularly for those peptides which do not dissolve completely.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/892-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(A) BSA-peptide conjugation validation by gel electrophoresis. There is an obvious shift of the conjugations when compare BSA-peptide conjugation to BSA and activated BSA.\n(B) The layout and image of the peptide microarray. Fabricated peptide microarray of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was incubated with Anti-BSA followed by Cy3 labeled secondary antibody. Each spot indicates one probe and each probe is printed in triplicate. The peptides that failed to be synthesized or conjugated were replaced by Printing buffer.\n(C) A representative image of serum profiling with the peptide microarray as same as in B. Green, the 532 nm channel, IgG response; Red, the 635 nm channel, IgM response.\n(D) Calculation of Factor N for slide   i  . Each spot indicates one peptide. The Factor N for the slide is 1.4094, which would be used for normalization.\n(E) An Example of the linear epitope map for SARS-CoV-2 Spike generated by ImmunomeBrowser. The map is reprinted with permission from Li et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nPeptide microarray fabrication\nTiming: 2 days\nHigh quality microarray is essential for high quality data acquisition. This part provides detailed procedures as well as considerations to fabricate peptide microarray. For the Spike peptides, we created an array of 32 × 20 features with triplicates for each probe.\nLoad the dissolved peptides and controls to a 384-well plate\nDilute the BSA-peptide conjugates with Printing buffer (1 × PBS with 25% glycerol) to 0.3 mg/mL.\nNote: The concentration refers to the peptides. The optimal concentration of peptides for serum detection is 0.1–1 mg/mL according to our experience. However, the optimal concentration that largely depends on the sample types or antibody concentrations, if required, it needs to be determined in a case-by-case manner.",
    "According to the designed layout of the microarray, add the probes into the designated wells of the 384-well plate. For the Spike peptides, we created an array of 32 × 20 features with triplicates for each probe (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The minimal volume is 10 μL per well, while the maximal volume is 50 μL. The minimal and maximal volume would be different for alternative types of 384-well plates.\nNote: the probes should be handled on ice.\nCentrifuge the plate at 800 × g for 1 min at 4°C.\nPause point: the prepared plate could be stored at −80°C for long term (at least one year).\nMicroarray printing\nUse the printer (Super Marathon) to print the probes on PATH substrate slides according to the manufacture’s instruction (https://www.arrayjet.co.uk/instruments/printers-in-detail[href=https://www.arrayjet.co.uk/instruments/printers-in-detail]).\nIncubate the microarrays at 4°C with humidity less than 50% overnight (over 12 h).\nPut the slides into the dedicated slide box (5 or 1 slide(s) per box), seal the box with Parafilm and store the box at −80°C.\nPause point: the microarrays can be stored at −80°C for several years.\nGAL (GenePix Array List) file generation\nCreate an Excel file and list the position of the probes on 384-well plate (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_892_1.csv\nCreate GAL file using the printer software by combining of this file with the printing program.\nNote: The GAL file is for extracting the data from the microarray (step 17).\nOptional: Microarray quality evaluation. The steps for this experiment are similar with the following part of Serum Profiling (step 9–17) except that 1) the Blocking buffer were replaced by a commercial blocking buffer (QuickBlock blocking buffer) and 2) the microarray was incubated with an Anti-BSA antibody (1:1000) followed by incubation with a Cy3 labeled Anti-Mouse secondary antibody (1:1000).\nSerum profiling\nTiming: 1 day\nBlocking.",
    "Take out the slides from −80°C and place them at 4°C for 30 min followed by room temperature for 15 min to enable temperature equilibrium. The slide box should be well sealed during this process.\nCritical: for PATH substrates, condensate water would cause merging of neighboring dots without the equilibrium step.\nPrepare the Blocking buffer (1 × PBS with 3% BSA).\nAdd 30 mL Blocking buffer in the Slide Container at room temperature (22°C–27°C)(materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nKeep the face of the slide down. Immerse the barcode side into the buffer while keep the other side out, then keep barcode side and slowly lay down the other side until the whole side is immersed into buffer. Turn over the slide and leave the slide immersed in the blocking buffer.\nCritical: It is better to take 1.5 minutes or longer to finish this process to avoid trailing effect (a phenomenon that a big tail attached to the otherwise circular feature).\nKeep the slides at room temperature (22°C–27°C) and shake at 20–30 rpm (revolutions per minute) on a shaker for 3 h.\nWash and dry the slide.\nDiscard the Blocking buffer, add 20–30 mL 1 × PBS and keep the slides shaken at 20–30 rpm for 5 min at room temperature (22°C–27°C).\nDiscard the buffer, add 20–30 mL 0.2 × PBS and keep the slides shaken at 20–30 rpm for 5 min at room temperature (22°C–27°C).\nDiscard the buffer, add 20–30 mL ddH2O and keep the slides shaken at 20–30 rpm for 5 min at room temperature (22°C–27°C).\nDry the slides by centrifugation. As list in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] table, we used a specialized slide centrifuge SlideWasher™ 8 with default parameters. Alternatively, a normal staining rack with a compatible centrifuge can be used (500 × g for 1–2 min).",
    "Pause point: The dried slides can be stored at 4°C in a dry environment for at least one month without compromised signal intensity for serum profiling.\nSera sample preparation. Centrifuge the tube at 12,000 × g at 4°C for 20 min.\nSample incubation\nInstall a 16-well chamber with gasket on the slide.\nDilute the sera sample as well as the positive control (1: 200) with Incubation buffer (1 × PBS with 0.1% tween-20 and 1% BSA).\nAdd 200 μL diluted sample into one well that contains one subarray. For each slide, the last two blocks or wells are added with Incubation buffer and positive sera sample as blank control and positive control, respectively, i.e., block # 13 for blank control, and block #14 for positive control. A blank control is used to monitor unexpected contaminations.\nNote: 1) The samples can be added with a multichannel pipette. 2) Immediately record the sera number, the block position and the slide number.\nIncubate the slide at room temperature (22°C–27°C) for 2 h. It is recommended to keep them in a box to prevent evaporation.\nPre-wash and wash.\nRemove the solution from each well with a multichannel pipette, add 200 μL Wash buffer (1 × PBS with 0.1% tween-20) to each well, and pipette up and down for 15–20 times.\nRepeat the above step twice.\nUninstall the 16-well chamber.\nCritical: Do not leave the surface of the slide dry.\nPlace the slide in a container with ∼20 mL Wash buffer. Keep the container at room temperature (22°C–27°C) and shake for 90–100 rpm on a shaker for 10 min.\nRepeat the above step twice.\nSecondary antibody incubation\nDilute the secondary antibody (1: 1000) with Incubation buffer.",
    "Remove the Wash buffer from the container and add 15 mL diluted secondary antibodies. Depending on the isotypes of antibody of interest, multiple isotypes could be detected simultaneously, only if the isotype specific fluorescence labeled secondary antibodies are available and compatible with the microarray scanner. Here, we detected the IgG and IgM isotypes using Cy3 (532 nm excitation) and Alexa Fluor 647 (635 nm excitation) labeled isotype specific antibody, respectively (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nNote: if only one slide is used, a smaller container would be suggested with a smaller incubation volume.\nKeep the container at room temperature (22°C–27°C) and shake for 20–30 rpm on a shaker for 1 h. Keep the slides shielded from light.\nWash and dry\nRemove the solution from the container and add 30 mL Wash buffer. Keep the container at room temperature (22°C–27°C) and shake for 90–100 rpm on a shaker for 10 min.\nRepeat the above step twice.\nWash twice with ddH2O.\nDry the slide by centrifugation.\nNote: From step 15 on, the slides should be kept under dark.\nMicroarray scanning (link to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 2–4)\nOpen the Scanner Genepix 4200A and warm up for 15 min.\nScan the slide with 532 nm (IgG) and 635 nm (IgM) laser, successively. Recommended scanning parameters: 95% power, PMT 200–300. However, the optimal scanning intensity should be adjusted according to the overall signal intensity.\nAfter scanning is completed, save the two images as one single TIF file.\nCritical: 1) All sides which belongs to the same experiment should apply the same parameters. 2) Avoid scraping or touching the surface of the microarrays in any way during the whole process.\nMicroarray data processing\nTiming: 1 day",
    "Quantitative signal intensity (indicating the antibody response) to each peptide for one sample could be acquired by transforming the color intensity of the microarray image to digital signals, which is microarray data extraction. Then, normalization is performed to enable comparations of the signal intensities among the samples.\nExtract microarray data\nUse the software Genepix 6.0 to align the features. The software enables automatic alignment of the GAL file (step 8) to the features of the microarray image, however, it is necessary to double check all aligned features and adjust the incorrectly aligned features. It is a time-consuming process.\nExtract the data of all features to generate a GPR file (raw data) for each slide.\nCalculate signal intensity\nCalculate signal intensity for each feature: subtract Foreground Median (F median) with Background Median (B median). IgG (532 nm channel) and IgM (635 nm channel) are calculated separately.\nCalculate the average of the triplicates of each probe in the same subarray.\nPerform normalization among slides. Use the data of the positive sera sample (the data of block #14 for each slide) to calculate the normalization factor (Factor N) for each slide. IgG (532 nm channel) and IgM (635 nm channel) are calculated separately.\nWith the data of block #14 of all slides, calculate the overall average signal intensity for each peptide (not for the control probes) to create a reference data set.\nExclude the peptides with low signal intensity (< 300).\nCalculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the reference data set and the data of block #14 for each slide. If the coefficient is less than 0.98, exclude some spots far away from the diagonal line.",
    "Perform linear fitting and calculate the Factor N for each slide using the following function in Excel software: LINEST (Y, X  i  , FALSE), where the Y is the reference data set, the X  i   is the data of block #14 from the slide   i   , and the FLASE means to make the constant term equal to 0.\nFor each slide, all the signal intensities are normalized by multiplying the corresponding Factor N.\nLinear epitope landscape\nDue to potential non-specific binding, sera from healthy people were set as negative controls to define the basal signal intensity for each peptide, so response frequency could be specifically depicted for each peptide in the patient group. For the map, higher frequency value implies widespread epitopes of the target antigen. The peptides with higher response frequency imply epitopes that elicit stronger antibody responses.\nSet threshold for each peptide\nUse serum samples from healthy people to define the baseline and calculate the threshold value as Mean value + 2 × SD (standard deviation).\nCalculate positive rate or frequency response for each peptide for the patient group.\nGenerate linear epitope map. For each peptide, provide the total patient sera number and positive number as well as the peptide sequence to the webpage-based tool ImmunomeBrowser (Dhanda et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). An epitope map would be generated (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). For the map, higher frequency value implies widespread epitopes of the target antigen. For SARS-CoV-2 Spike, several hot areas in rich of linear epitopes were indicated in the map."
