    "Isolation and digestion of lymph nodesPrepare digestion mixes 1 and 2 (see Recipes) and place in a water bath at 37 °C. Note: The volume of the digestion mixes prepared is dependent on the number of samples required for the experiment. 1 ml of each digestion mix is required for up to 6 skin draining lymph nodes (LN). Digestion mixes are prepared fresh for each experiment. We prepare the required amount of each enzyme for each experiment. However, users can prepare a 100x stock of the enzymes (in RPMI) and store them at -20 °C for further usage if preferred.Harvest LN from mice, place in wells of a 24-well plate containing 1 ml of RP-2 solution per well (see Recipes) and keep on ice. Note: We typically process two skin draining LN from non-infected mice (inguinal, axillary or brachial). During an inflammatory episode such as Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) flank infection, we process the brachial LN individually. If popliteal LN are isolated, we pool and process at least 4 LN from non-infected mice, and only one during an inflammatory event.To assist with the identification of mouse LN, users can refer to a diagram of the localization of LN in the mouse model, available here:http://www.informatics.jax.org/greenbook/figures/figure13-4.shtml[href=http://www.informatics.jax.org/greenbook/figures/figure13-4.shtml]Take the LN out of the plate and disrupt the LN into 4-5 pieces with two thin forceps.Transfer disrupted LN into a 10 ml tube and add 1 ml of digest mix 1. Note: During this step, LN are not put back into the 24-well plate. Thus they are digested in 1 ml with the digestion mix 1. Place tubes in the water bath and incubate for 25 min at 37 °C. Invert tube and flick a few times during digestion.",
    "After incubation, cut off the tip of 1 ml pipette and thoroughly mix the digested LN for 30 sec, up to 1 min. Leave undisturbed until remaining visible pieces of tissue settle to the bottom of the tube. Remove supernatant without taking the undigested pieces of LN and transfer into a 50 ml tube containing 15 ml of FACS buffer (see Recipes) and keep on ice. Note: Make sure to remove as much supernatant as possible without taking any pieces of LN. There should be minimal medium left in the tube. One round of digestion is not enough to properly digest LN and thus two rounds of digestion are necessary to maximize the yield of SC to be released.Add 1 ml of digestion mix 2 to the undigested pieces of LN left from step A7 and place in the water bath for 15 min at 37 °C. After incubation, thoroughly mix the digested LN with 1 ml pipette for 1 min. Transfer supernatant to tubes containing the cell suspension from step A8. Note: LN should completely be digested after this step. If any pieces are remaining, repeat steps A9 and A10 with 10-min incubation only.Centrifuge cell suspension for 5 min at 500 x g, 4 °C. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cell suspension in 500 (for up to 6 skin draining LN, or popliteal LN) or 1,000 μl of FACS buffer (if more than 6 skin draining LN). Filter cell suspension through 70 μm nylon mesh in a 5 ml FACS tube and count cells. Note: Users can also use counting beads (blank calibration particles) during acquisition by flow cytometry, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.Antibody staining of LN cell suspensionsTransfer up to 200 μl of the cell suspension into each well of a 96 U-bottom well plate.",
    "Note: If plate holders are not available, the staining can be performed in small Eppendorf tubes and a refrigerated micro-centrifuged can be used. Alternatively, staining can be performed in FACS tubes. Centrifuge plate at 500 x g for 5 min and at 4 °C then flick off the supernatant. Add 50 μl of the stromal cell antibody cocktail mix (see Recipes) to each well, resuspend the cells and incubate for 25 min at 4 °C in the dark. Add 150 μl of FACS buffer per well, centrifuge the plate and flick off the supernatant. Resuspend cell suspension in 200 μl of FACS buffer and run the stained cells in a flow cytometer (BD LSRFORTESSA)."
