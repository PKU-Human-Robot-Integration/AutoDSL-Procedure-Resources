    "Animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the VA WNY HCS and the University at Buffalo-SUNY. Animals were used according to the stipulations of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) and the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Mouse Models\nIdentify mouse models to be evaluated including controls.\nNOTE: Imaging was performed for a C57BL/6(J), hC1/hC1//mWT/mWT, a partially humanized mouse retinal degeneration model homozygous for human mutant RHOP347S hC1 alleles on the wild-type (WT) mouse RHO+/+ genotype26,27, hC1 x BL/6(J), a partially humanized model with a single copy of the mutant human RHOP347S hC1 allele on the WT mouse RHO+/+ genotype (hC1/-//mWT/mWT) (obtained by crossing hC1/hC1//mWT/mWT with C57BL/6(J) mice). The above autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) models are on the C57BL/6(J) background. A mouse model that is homozygous for two copies of the human WT RHO gene on the mouse RHO knockout background was also used28,29. This line is on the 129Sv background. When this line was crossed with a mouse RHO knockout on the 129Sv background, a single dose of human RHO occurs on the mouse RHO background.\nMaintain the animals following the conditions pertinent to the experimental design.\nNOTE: The animals were maintained in the Veterinary Medical Unit (VMU) at the VA WNY HCS. Mice were fed standard lab chow and grown under 12 h:12 h light: dark cycles with soft fluorescent overhead white lights with approximately 300 lux at cage level at approximately 72 ˚F.\n2. Mouse Eye Gel\nPrepare the optical gel used for retinal imaging30 and surgical procedures.\nCombine 2 mg/mL w/v high molecular weight (4 x 106 g/mol carbomer in sterile 1x Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS).\nMix at room temperature until the gel forms a viscous optically transparent gel.",
    "Transfer the gel into small sterile bottles and centrifuge in a swinging bucket tabletop centrifuge at 350 x g to remove trapped air bubbles.\nApply the gel directly to the cornea to create an interface between the mouse cornea and a premium cover glass (18 mm x 18 mm).\n3. HR-SD-OCT Imaging\nSee the HR-SD-OCT device (Figure 1).\nWeigh the animal to determine the proper dose of anesthetic. Then anesthetize the mouse using 25 µL/g of body weight of the 2.5% solution of buffered 2,2,2-tribromoethyl alcohol (Avertin) solution via intraperitoneal injection (IP) and add the eye drops to dilate the pupils after the animal is immobilized.\nConfirm that the animal is fully anesthetized by a toe pinch, and be certain the animal does not react.\nTrim the whiskers and place the mouse onto the HR-SD-OCT sled.\nPosition the mouse's eye directly in front of the headpiece lens and manipulate the stage controls until the cornea and iris are located. Keep the cornea hydrated by applying artificial tears.\nNOTE: The fine adjustment micromanipulators on the HR-SD-OCT sled are used to position the mouse such that the pupil aperture is centered and oriented. The optical headpiece is then advanced until the retina becomes visible and the animal is further adjusted to obtain the best possible image.",
    "First, open the software program \"Mouse\" and click \"patient/exam\". Second, click \"add patient\" and enter the pertinent information to identify the animal in the new patient window and \"save and Exit\". Third, click \"add exam\" followed by \"start exam\". Fourth, click \"add custom scan\" and select \"rectangular volume\", choose OD or OS for the eye being imaged, then click \"add exam\". Finally, start aiming the instrument and positioning the animal to obtain the region of interest. After finding the correct region, remove any excess fluid from the eye surface using a sterile cotton tipped applicator just prior to image acquisition in order to further enhance image quality, then click \"start snapshot\", and if a good image is obtained, click \"save scan\".\nNOTE: Typical parameters for rectangular HR-SD-OCT images are 900 a-scans/b-scan and 90 b-scans/image. Acquired images are 1.4 mm x 1.4 mm. The region of the retina imaged depends on the specific experiment, but most images are centered on the optic nerve head (ONH).\n4. Assessing the Presence, Rate, and Uniformity of Model Outer Retinal Degenerations\nOuter Retinal Degeneration Model Evaluation by HR-SD-OCT\nObtain animals with a wide spectrum of ages for both the control and experimental subjects to assess the presence, rate, and uniformity of outer retinal degeneration.\nPerform HR-SD-OCT imaging on multiple animals at each age from both cohorts (disease and normal). Use the method described in 3.1.6 to obtain the OCT images.\nNOTE: Data can be collected from a large cohort of animals all at once, which have distributed birthdays spanning a wide period of time (1 year), or a small cohort of animal can be used to collect multiple images over a long period of time (1 year) to obtain similar results.",
    "Open a recorded HR-SD-OCT rectangular volume image, and identify the first b-scan to be measured (ideally will include the ONH or other identifiable landmark) from the ensemble of images. Enlarge the image to fill the screen using the zoom feature in the software.\nOpen the desired number of calipers by right clicking on the image of the b-scan and then clicking on \"Calipers\" and finally clicking on as many calipers as desired (they are numbered 1 through 10). Ensure that the calipers show up in lower right corner of the image. Using the \"Configure Caliper\" feature, assign them all as \"vertical\" in the angle block column and turn on the \"Display Caliper Location\" to facilitate uniform placement across the retina and finally, click apply.\nNOTE: The 1st caliper should be placed on the left side of the image when processing the oculus dexter (OD) right eye and the 1st Caliper should be placed on the right side of the image when processing the oculus sinister (OS) left eye images. This results in a nasal to temporal orientation of all the data for both the left and right eyes when plotting.\nUsing the computer mouse, move each caliper to the desired location (2.0 mm apart) across the b-scan, being sure to place one caliper in the center of the optic nerve head, in b-scan images that include it (set this caliper to zero). Then use the mouse to click and drag the caliper to length to span the region of interest. Arbitrarily set calipers that do not overlay measurable regions of the b-scan to maximum length, and ignore during the data analysis.",
    "Measure the ONL thickness using the Caliper tools, by placing the top of the caliper at the external limiting membrane (ELM) and the bottom of the caliper at the bottom of the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Repeat this for each caliper across the retina at 0.2 mm increments. Save the measurements.\nAfter all calipers have been placed and adjusted to size, right click on the image and click \"Save Caliper Data\".\nRepeat measurements on subsequent b-scans (every 10th scan works well) from the same rectangular volume OCT image spanning the entire retina from inferior to superior regions. Calipers should remain open and at the same location in the X-axis. Adjust the length of the calipers without moving them in the X-direction.\nOpen the save data files by clicking the small file icon next to the processed b-scan image and click \"Go to Data\". Click \"Date Modified to arrange the files in order based on time saved, and open all the files for each b-scan measured.\nCompile the raw data from each b-scan into a single file in order from lowest to highest based on frame number. Select the columns of data including \"Caliper name\", \"Length\", and \"Center X\".\nEnsure that the center X is the same for all b-scans measured for each rectangular volume OCT image processed. Delete any data from calipers that were not used to record measurements, and set the caliper located at the center of the optic nerve head to zero.\nPlot the data for X vs. multiple Y data sets to get a 3D plot function to plot the overall thickness of the ONL or another measured retinal layer.\nCompare ONL measurements between control and experimental animals with corresponding ages to determine the rate and uniformity of any potential retinal degeneration.",
    "Repeat the process for OSL measurements using the same b-scan images. Follow the same methodology used to measure the ONL, except placing the calipers between ELM and Bruch's membrane (BM).\nNOTE: An example of how to place the caliper is shown in Representative Results section (Figure 3B). This should be done on a zoomed in image to decrease error.\nRepeat the data analysis for multiple animals for each birthday for both experimental and control cohorts.\nComprehensive measurement and 3D mapping of the ONL or OSL thickness using the software calipers tool\nReview the post injection OCT images and make note of any identifiable landmarks, like the ONH or blood vessels in the retina. Then position the mouse to obtain a follow-up SD-OCT from the same region, and be sure to include the same identifiable landmarks.\nNOTE: Ensure that the region of the retina imaged and involved in the retinal detachment is identified in the post injection SD-OCT images. Record a rectangular volume SD-OCT image and save it.\nProcess the recorded images as described above in steps 4.1.3. to 4.1.14. Save the caliper data and plot as described above.\nNOTE: The resulting array of ONL measurements is used to create a 3D plot depicting the ONL thickness. The position of the calipers along the X-axis allow one to replot the graph placing the optic nerve at the origin (0) along the X-axis. The Y-axis is plotted using the b-scan number and the optic nerve is then used to define the starting point, which allows one to properly position the optic nerve at the origin on the Y-axis. Identifying the optic nerve in each data set allows follow-up images to be aligned reliably.\nMapping the extent of the injection site onto the fundus image",
    "Perform post injection rectangular volume OCT to confirm the success of the injection. Follow the method described in 3.6.\nUse the Caliper feature in the software to identify the inflection point at the border of the detached retina from a number of b-scans spanning the entire OCT image. Use the method to open calipers described in 4.1.4.\nRecord the fundus images with the mapped location of the OCT b-scan and corresponding caliper position on the fundus image, which corresponds to its location.\nCompile all of the fundus images into a composite image, including the caliper positions, which results in a precise map of the injection site onto the fundus image (Example in Representative Results section, Figure 5A).\n5. Intraocular Injections\nNOTE: Details on use of the RIS are further elaborated in a recent study23.\nPreparing glass injection needles\nAutoclave the capillary tubes with filaments in small batches, using the dry cycle.\nUse a pipette puller and set-up a program that will produce a glass tip with the sharpest angle, and a diameter in the range of 2-5 µm.\nNOTE: A sample 5 step program which produced effective needles on our pipette puller is shown in Table 1.\nStore the pulled glass needles in a sterile pipette needle jar at room temperature.\nFill the injection needle with the desired solution for injection\nMount the needle into the needle holder, leaving approximately 5/8\" protruding beyond the end of the holder.",
    "NOTE: A distance less than 5/8\" will make it difficult reach the injection solution to fill the needle, because the needle holder does not fit readily into the opening of 0.2 mL tubes. Also, having the needle protrude more than 5/8\" results in significantly larger oscillation or precession of the tip, making real time imaging difficult since the tip leaves the focal plane or the field of view (FOV), while attempting to puncture the eye.\nPrepare the injection solution in a sterile 0.2 mL tube. Add a 1:10 dilution of sterile fluorescein sulfate (10 mg/mL in 1x PBS) to the injection solution to obtain a final concentration of fluorescein at 1 mg/mL.\nNOTE: The exact dye used is specific to the user and can be anything that is non-toxic and visible to the naked eye under white light illumination to help facilitate precise placement of the needle tip at the level of the RPE and subretinal space.\nVisualize the needle through the stereo microscope while using the control knobs of the 3-axis micromanipulator to position the needle so that it is aligned with the center of the tube containing the injection solution to be used for filling the needle.\nCarefully drive the needle tip into the 0.2 mL tube until the tip of the needle is submerged in the fluid. Draw up the desired volume of injection fluid (e.g. 1 µL) into the needle necessary for a single injection. Maintain the remaining solution in the tube placed in ice.\nPreparing the animal for injection",
    "NOTE: The RIS microscope is kept clean, and is a non-contact system. The heating plate is covered with a clean adsorbent pad and needles are autoclaved prior to being pulled. After they are pulled by a self-sterilizing heated metal strip, they are kept in a closed sterilized chamber designed to hold pulled glass needles. The needles are only handled using gloved hands, and care is used to prevent touching the tip of the needle while mounting it into the holder. The injected solutions are prepared using sterile technique, and are tested for contamination by streaking a sample of the virus preparations onto LB agar plates and incubating them over night at 37 ˚C.\n\t\nWeigh the animal (g) to determine the appropriate dose of anesthetic analgesic.\nAdminister anesthetic (2.5% solution of buffered 2,2,2-tribromoethyl alcohol (Avertin)) via intraperitoneal injection (IP).\nImmediately apply anticholinergic drugs (e.g., cyclopentylate) to both eyes to dilate the pupils.\nTrim the animal's whiskers and number the animal using ear punch or other method.\nWash the eye and surrounding area with diluted betadine.\nNOTE: Avoid getting any solution around the nose, as this can result in unintentional drowning.\nPlace the mouse on the heating pad, maintained at 39 ˚C, in the pre-molded modeler's clay mouse holder with the eye to be injected towards the needle.\nMake sure the mouse is unresponsive using a pinch test of the hind foot.\nPerforming subretinal injection\nUse a pair of sterile blunt iris forceps to gently induce proptosis of the globe by placing the tips of the forceps at 7 and 10 o'clock positions on the eye lids while pushing open and downward at the same time.\nUse the forceps to coax the eyelids under the eye globe to keep it out of the socket during the injection process.",
    "NOTE: Animals 10 to 14 days old will often hold the eye out of the socket more easily than older animals.\nDirect the tip of the needle about 1-1.5 mm below the edge of the corneal limbus and carefully drive it into the eye through the conjunctiva until it creates a scleral depression as the needle penetrates into the tissue of the sclera, and allows manipulation of the eye.\nRotate the eye downward with the micromanipulator to visualize the scleral depression through the dilated pupil with the RIS stereo microscope.\nApply a drop of sterile eye gel or 1x PBS solution and cover with a sterile coverslip.\nFocus on the scleral depression created by the tip of the needle (2-5 µm), and drive the needle forward until a sharp peak of the retina forms at the injection site.\nRotate the needle using the holder until the tip bores through the sclera and the fluorescein in the needle is visible under the retina in the immediate vicinity of the RPE cell monolayer.\nDrive the tip of the needle so it is tangential to the globe, and then activate the injection pump with the foot pedal switch.\nAfter the desired volume has been delivered (0.5-1 µL) to the subretinal space, withdraw the needle and check if the bleb is stable and that fluid does not leak out of the injection site, which is the first criteria of a successful injection.\nNOTE: Maintaining a proper tip diameter (2-5 µm diameter) is critical to avoid leakage from injection site.\nPlace the animal on the imaging platform of the OCT instrument. Follow the directions for HR-SD OCT Imaging to record a rectangular volume image.",
    "Confirm that the injected fluid is located in the subretinal space, and save the images for determining the extent of the bleb.\nRemove the animal from the holder and apply an ample amount of antibiotic ointment to the injected eyes.\nPlace the animal onto a heating pad until it completely recovers, then place it back into the original cage where it came from.\nNOTE: Our animals are usually injected prior to weaning, therefore the animals need to be returned to the cage with the mother.\nMapping the extent of the subretinal bleb using OCT instrument software tools.\nObtain a rectangular volume OCT image, using methods described earlier, of the bleb and position it to include a recognizable landmark within the eye such as the ONH.\nNOTE: Recording 90 b-scans works well for mapping the bleb, but could be used depending upon the desired resolution.\nAdd a single caliper to the figure and place it at the inflection point where the retina detaches from the RPE and choroid.\nNOTE: The software automatically maps a corresponding point to a line onto the fundus image representing the caliper and the b-scan being evaluated.\nCapture the screen following placement of the calipers, and compile the images to effectively map the border of the injection bleb onto the fundus image, which precisely maps the injection site. Save the compiled image for reference to help in locating the regions of interest during follow-up imaging.\nNOTE: Alternatively, the caliper data can be saved, complied, and plotted using a similar method for plotting 3D data sets of ONL thickness.\nIntravitreal Injection",
    "Place the tip of the needle using a similar surgical approach as sub retinal injection, except that the needle is driven entirely through the sclera at the pars plana about 0.25 mm behind the corneal limbus and into the vitreous.\nFollowing needle placement, apply the injection pulse with the foot pedal.\nNOTE: A rapid diffusion of the fluorescein dye throughout the vitreous of the eyecup is observed, filling the dilated pupil aperture with fluorescence.\nSubscription Required.
