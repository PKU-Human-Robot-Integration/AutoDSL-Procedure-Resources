    "Resuspending β-amyloid peptide\nBefore getting started have ready:\nAβ1-42 (lyophilized powder)\n1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoro-2-Propanol (HFIP)\nLow-binding polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml)\nGasTight Hamilton syringe with Teflon plunge stop (250 μl)\nDimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)\nAllow lyophilized Aβ1-42 to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 minutes to avoid condensation upon opening the peptide vial.\nUnder the fume hood, re-suspend Aβ1-42 peptide in ice cold HFIP to obtain a 1 mM solution and vortex the solution for a few seconds.\nUsing a glass GasTight Hamilton syringe with Teflon  plug, quickly divide the Aβ1-42/HFIP solution equally into three polypropylene vials and seal the vials.\nThe vials are then incubated for 2 hours to allow for Aβ monomerization. Next, open the vials and concentrate the Aβ1-42/HFIP solution under vacuum by using a SpeedVac centrifuge (800 g, room temperature) until a clear peptide film is observed at the bottom of the vials. Check carefully the temperature inside the SpeedVac centrifuge to avoid peptide degradation (max 25°C).\nSeal the vials and store the aliquots at -80°C.  Aβ film can be stored for 6 months.\nRe-suspend one film by adding DMSO to obtain a concentration up to 5 mM Aβ1-42. Sonicate in the water bath for 10 minutes to ensure complete re-suspension.\nAliquot this  5mM Aβ1-42  solution  into  polypropylene  vials. Seal all the vials and store them at -20°C. Aliquots should be thawed only once. Beware of water condensation inside the freezer. Peptides in solution degrade very easily.\nOligomerization\nBefore getting started have ready:\nAβ1-42/DMSO (5mM)\nSterile phosphate buffer\nLow-binding polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml)\nLow-binding polypropylene centrifuge tubes (50 ml)\nDilute the obtained 5mM Aβ1-42/DMSO aliquot with sterile phosphate buffer (up to 100 μl).\nVortex for 30 seconds and then incubate for 12 hours at 4°C\nHippocampal slice treatment",
    "When treating hippocampal slices, it is important to avoid non-specific peptide adhesion onto beakers, perfusion tubing surfaces, and the recording chamber. Use preferentially low-binding polypropylene tubing and containers. Avoid the use of glassware or generic plastic-ware. Perfusion media should be serum- or albumin-free.\nAβ perfusion\nBefore getting started have ready:\nOligomerized Aβ1-42\nRecording buffer (in mM: 124 NaCl, 4.4 KCl, 1 Na2HPO4, 25 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 glucose)\nElectrophysiological recording set-up with interface chamber\nTransverse hippocampal slices incubated in oxygenated recording buffer for at least 90 minutes post-dissection (T = 29° C; constant perfusion rate = 2 ml/minute)\nImmediately prior to the experiment, dilute the oligomerized Aβ1-42 aliquot to the appropriate working concentration (200 nM or higher) in a polypropylene tube with pre-oxygenated recording buffer.\nPerfuse the Aβ1-42 solution for 20 minutes to the slices before the induction of synaptic plasticity.\nInduction of plasticity and follow-up\nTypically, the most widely-used model of synaptic plasticity is the LTP. It can be induced through tetanic stimulation of a given synapse in the hippocampus. We record field responses from synapses between the Shaffer's collateral projections and CA1 pyramidal neurons in the stratum radiatum. Our tetanic stimulation consists of a theta burst stimulation which includes 3 trains separated by 15 second intervals.  Each train consists of 10 bursts at 5 Hz where each burst entails 5 pulses at 100 Hz. Apply the tetanic stimulation immediately after the perfusion of oligomerized Aβ has been completed.\nImmediately after the tetanic stimulation switch back to perfusion with normal recording buffer. Maintain a constant perfusion rate, recording chamber temperature and proper oxygenation throughout the duration of the experiment.\nRepresentative Results and possible problems",
    "The Aβ oligomerized according to the classical protocol of Stine et coll.1, generates Aβ monomers and a variety of oligomers of different sizes (dimer, trimer, etc.) The perfusion of oligomerized Aβ1-42 leads to decreased LTP in Aβ-treated slices compared to control slices. Under our experimental conditions, where 3-5 month old C57BL/6J male mice are used, LTP in 200 nM Aβ-treated slices is on average 150% of the baseline values at two hours after tetanic stimulation, while in control slices LTP values are on average 200-250% of baseline2. In some cases, treatment with Aβ may fail to reduce hippocampal LTP. Several critical errors that might occur include excessive film drying during Aβ concentration and incomplete oligomerization. Aβ perfusion in hippocampal slices might be another source of concern because of the physicochemical properties of the Aβ peptide in solution, which is prone to non-specific adhesion to plastics. Troubleshooting of these issues is discussed below.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
