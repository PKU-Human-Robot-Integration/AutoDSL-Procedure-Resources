    "All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). NIH guidelines for laboratory animal care and safety are strictly followed. Animals with surgical procedures were adequately treated for minimizing pain and discomfort.\n1. Spinal Cord Curgery and Cell Grafting\nAutoclave surgical instruments prior to all surgeries. Use Hot Bead Sterilizer (Fine Science Tools) to remove pathogens and microbial contaminants from instruments between procedures on different animals. Use sterile surgical gloves, gown, and drapes during the surgery. Employ aseptic surgical technique for each surgical procedure.\nAnesthetize female Fischer 344 rats with a combination (2 ml/kg) of ketamine (25 mg/ml), xylazine (1.3 mg/ml), and acepromazine (0.25 mg/ml) administered via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.).\nShave the back area and clean the skin repeatedly with Betadine and ethanol.\nCut the skin using a #10 blade and bluntly dissect muscles layers. Use a scalpel to isolate the vertebrae, expose the T3 vertebra, and perform a dorsal laminectomy using a fine-tipped rongeurs.\nIncise the dura longitudinally and transect the spinal cord at T4 level using a combination of iridectomy scissors and microaspiration to create an approximately 1 mm rostrocaudal gap between the spinal cord stumps.\nWait about 1 - 2 min until the bleeding fully stops, then suture muscles with 3-0 Vycril and close the skin with wound clips.\nInject Lactated Ringer’s (5 ml), buprenorphine (0.035 mg/kg), and Ampicillin (33 mg/kg) subcutaneously immediately after surgery and maintain rats in a warm incubator until awake.\nInject the Ringer’s and Ampicillin solution once daily up to 10 days, and buprenorphine twice daily for 3 days or until signs of pain and distress disappear. Do not return an animal to the company of other animals until fully recovered.",
    "Manually empty the bladder twice a day for about two weeks until the establishment of reflex bladder emptying, and then empty the bladder once a day throughout the survival if necessary.\nTwo weeks later, re-anesthetize SCI rats as described above and re-expose the spinal cord lesion site. Keep the dura closed to retain implanted cells in the lesion site.\nInject 10 µl of cell solution (3.5 × 105 µl), collected from E14 ubiquitous GFP transgenic rat embryos and embedded in fibrinogen and thrombin5,6, into the epicenter of the lesion cavity and the rostral and caudal interface of lesion with multiple injection sites, using a pulled glass micropipette with an inner diameter of 40 µm, connected to a Hamilton syringe.\nSuture the muscle layers and close the skin with wound clips.\nPerform post surgery injection and bladder care as described in steps 1.6 – 1.8.\nOne week before perfusion, inject 0.5% Fluorogold (FG, 0.4 ml in distilled water) intraperitoneally to retrogradely label sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord7.\n2. Transmitter Implantation\nSoak transmittersin 2% glutaraldehyde solution (4 ml of 50% glutaraldhyde in 96 ml distilled water) for at least 1 - 2 hr (up to 10 hr) at room temperature for sterilization.\nWash transmitters thoroughly with sterile 0.9% saline 3 times and store them in saline until use (no more than 1 hr).\nEight weeks after E14 cell transplantation (10 weeks post injury), reanesthetize the rats that underwent a SCI with or without cell grafting and naïve control rats.\nShave the abdominal area and hindlimbs. Clean the skin with Betadine. Place the rat on the surgical table in supine position.\nIncise the skin on the ventral abdomen and inner thigh on the right side using a #15 blade.",
    "Cut through the subcutaneous connective tissues to expose the bundle of femoral vessels and nerve using a small scissors.\nSeparate the femoral artery from the vein and the nerve using a fine forceps with curved tips.\nPut three silk sutures underneath the artery and make a loose knot in each suture.\nApply 0.1 ml Lidocaine (2%) to the surface of the artery to elicit vasodilation for subsequent catheterization.\nSecure the vessel distally with a permanent silk knot and temporary block proximally by stretching a loose silk suture.\nPuncture the artery using a 20 gauge curved needle and insert the tip of the telemeter catheter (8 cm long) using a catheter insertion tool.\nInsert the catheter rostrally up to 4 cm thereby placing the tip in the thoracic aorta.\nAnchor the catheter within the vessel by tying three silk sutures around the femoral artery.\nMake a subcutaneous pocket along the flank between the caudal edge of ribcage and the most cranial extension of knee's range with a blunt scissors.\nInsert the transmitter body into the pocket and suture to the connective tissue surrounding the transmitter to avoid excessive movement.\nSuture the skin with No. 6 silk thread.\nInject Lactated Ringer’s (5 ml), buprenorphine (0.035 mg/kg), and Ampicillin (33 mg/kg) subcutaneously immediately after surgery and maintain rats in a warm incubator until awake.\n3. Basal Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and Heart Rate (HR) Recording\nAs early as one day following transmitter implantation, put a single animal on the receiver pad and turn the transmitter on. Wait for around 10 - 15 min to habituate the animal and stabilize the cardiovascular parameters.\nRecord resting MAP and HR, which are derived from the pulse arterial pressure with a computerized data acquisition system for at least 1 hr. Collect data every 5 sec.",
    "Monitor the animals continuously and remove data points during the occurrence of visible spasms. For each animal, average data points to obtain mean values.\n4. Colorectal Distension-induced Autonomic Dysreflexia\nRestrain NSC-grafted or SCI control rats in a towel supplied with food pellets inside on the transmitter receiver. Usually rats can stay cooperatively during the procedure.\nInsert a latex balloon-tipped catheter into the rectum for approximately 2 cm and secure it to the tail with tape8.\nTurn the transmitter on and wait for 10 - 15 min allowing the blood pressure to return to preinsertion baseline.\nInduce colorectal distension by inflation of the balloon slowly over 10 sec with 1.4 ml of air for 1 min, to generate a pressure of approximately 30 mmHg.\nRecord MAP and HR 1 min before, 1 min during, and 1 min after colorectal distension; sample data every 3 sec during the 3 min procedure.\nPerform 2 - 3 trials per animal with at least 15 min recovery interval between two trials.\nOverdose animals (i. p.) with double dose anesthesia combination described above if no further evaluation. Perfuse animals with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.\nFor each animal, average the values before and during colorectal distension respectively; calculate the difference between baseline and distension-induced MAP and HR changes for each trial; average over the 2 - 3 trials to obtain mean values.\n5. Transmitter Cleaning\nRemove the transmitter from the animal body after anesthesia but before perfusion. Soak immediately in a beaker filled with distilled water until cleaning; avoid drying of the telemeter device.\nTransfer the telemeter to 1% Terg-A-Zyme enzymatic cleaning solution (10 g/L water) for 24 hr at room temperature.\nRegel the tip of transmitter catheter with a blunt 30 gauge needle connected to the regel syringe.",
    "Carefully dry the transmitter using a folded soft tissue and store it in the original plastic tray.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
