    "1. Preparation of Collagen Gels\nPrepare a stock medium, containing 455 μl 10x MEM, 112 μl 7.5% NaHCO3, 50 μl glutamine and NaOH. The concentration and the amount of the NaOH depends on the rat- tail collagen preparation (see 1.2), the final volume of the stock medium being 1,000 μl.\nPrepare rat-tail collagen according to Ebendal (1). Store the Collagen solution at 4 °C. A degradation of the collagen solution could not be observed. After preparation of a new batch, estimate the NaOH concentration needed for the stock medium (see 1.1). Use the pH-indicator of the medium for titration of the amount and concentration of NaOH. 800 μl acidic rat-tail collagen have to turn a shade of red when mixed with 210 μl of the stock medium. If the concentration of NaOH is too low the collagen solution will turn yellow, due to the pH indicator of the medium. Add the collagen to the medium and mix without producing bubbles. Perform these steps on ice. The polymerization occurs within 2 hr after the collagen solution and the stock medium have been mixed and the new solution is incubated at 37 °C. Test this before starting an experiment. 1.3) Mix 800 μl of collagen solution with 210 μl of stock medium (see 1.2). Place 100 μl of this solution in wells of an 8 well chamber slide. Incubate the slides at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and humid conditions in a cell culture incubator. Prepare the collagen gels under a cell culture bench and sterile conditions. The collagen gelatinizes within 2 hr.\n2. Dissection of Embryonic SCGs\nHarvest embryos of time pregnant mice (E16-18) from the uterus and keep them in PBS until further needed.",
    "Dissect one embryo from the amnion. Decapitate the embryo caudal of the clavicular level. Fix the head on a silicon bottom dish with \"insect-needles\". The ventral side of the head has to face to you and you have to see the submandibular region. The fixation enables easier preparation.\nRemove the skin of the submandibular region left and right and with it the sub-cutaneous connective tissue.\nRemove the submandibular salivary glands from their location to clear the view onto the hyoid, the infrahyoidal muscles and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nRemove these muscles carefully to clear the view onto the larynx and the trachea. Remove the trachea and the larynx. The carotid arteries are then visible on both sides on the prevertebral muscles. The SCG is located in the bifurcation of the carotid arteries and has an oval shape. Carefully remove the ganglia and place them in PBS. Remove the ganglia gently from the dissection tools if they are sticking to them. It is beneficial to use forceps as well as a needle holder mounted with an \"insect needle\" for the SCG removal.\nOnce in PBS, store the ganglia at room temperature in PBS until you dissected enough ganglia. Then clean the ganglia from blood vessels and connective tissue. Perform the SCG dissection and cleaning under a dissecting microscope placed under a laminar flow bench.\nFinally, place the explanted ganglia onto the gelatinized collagen gels with the help of syringe needles mounted on a syringe for easier handling.\nIncubate the SCG explants on the gelatinized collagen in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C, with 5 % CO2 and humid conditions.\n3. Treatment of SCG Explants",
    "After 1-2 hr incubation, cover the SCG explant containing collagen with 100 μl Neurobasal cell culture medium containing B27 supplement, glutamine and antibiotics. Now the wells of the chamber slides contain a volume of 200 μl (100 μl gel and 100 μl medium). Add another 200 μl of the medium, however now containing NGF (60 ng/ml) to facilitate axonal growth. Accordingly the final NGF concentration is 30 ng/ml.\nTo investigate the onset of SC migration, add additional factors directly at day in vitro 0 (DIV0). Dissolve the factors in the NGF containing medium in the double concentration needed (2).\nIn order to analyze the impact on SCs, which already started migrating along axons, add additional factors at DIV3 until DIV4 (potential stop of the experiment). To this end, carefully remove 180 μl of the solution, at DIV3, and add 200 μl new medium containing NGF and the additional factors of interest at the double concentration (2).\n4. Time-lapse Imaging",
    "Use an inverted microscope for analyses. Various objectives can be used, defining the field of view and magnification. One important aspect, however, is the working distance of the used objective, as imaging of the SCG explants is performed through the glass slide and the collagen gel. The recording frame rate of 1/10-30 minutes showed good results (2). However, this aspect has to be adjusted to the scientific question. A normal CCD camera can be used for image acquisition. For time lapse imaging a cell culture incubation chamber has to be attached to the stage of the microscope. Incubate the tissue during imaging at 37 °C, with 5% CO2 and humid conditions. Start the incubation system one hour before the start of imaging. This allows the microscope parts (e.g. objective) including the chamber slide to adjust to the temperature and prevents temperature induced drifts. Define specific areas of analyses (within on explant and between different explants) with the help of the microscope software and a software-controlled motorized stage (multiposition setup) for simultaneous analyses of different applied conditions to the SCG explants. For time-lapse imaging wildtype tissue as well as tissue from transgenic animals can be used marking the SCs (s100b:GFP) (3). For imaging fluorophores a fluorescent light source has to be implemented in the micropscope setup. Use standard filters.\n5. Quantification of SC migration distances",
    "At the end point (DIV4 for instance), fix the collagen gels with 4% PFA in the chamber slide for 3-4 hr. Consecutively wash the collagen gels 5 times for 10 min with PBS. Apply standard protocols for immunocytochemistry (2). If you are new to the preparation of SCGs, verify the identity of the ganglion as a sympathetic ganglion by immunohistochemistry against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) a common marker for catecholaminergic cells. During immunohistochemistry (after the primary antibody), transfer the explant containing collagen gels to 24 well plates, which have a greater volume, which is beneficial for washing the gels.\nAfter immunohistochemistry, carefully place the collagen gels on glass slides. Carefully remove the remaining solution and let the collagen dry/shrink to two dimensions. This allows easy measurements of distances (2). After this, mount the samples.\nFinally, measure migration distances with the help of Fiji (NIH) software. No special plugins are needed to this end. To allow correct measurements in μm, check the correct imaging metadata and the settings under the Fiji, image and scale. Use Fiji also for quantification of cells.\nSubscription Required.
