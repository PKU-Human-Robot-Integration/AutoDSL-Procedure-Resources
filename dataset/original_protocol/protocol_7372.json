Experimental timeline for the culture of the human Colon Intestine-Chip   Isolation and cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)  Follow the instructions outlined in section A of Part I: Alveolar Lung-Chip protocol. Thawing of human intestinal microvasculature endothelial cells (HIMECs) (Day -3)   Note: HIMECs are included in the Emulate Basic Research kit.  Heat 50 mL of HIMEC culture medium to 37 °C.Add 5 mL of attachment factor onto the entire growth surface of a T-75 flask and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2  for 5 min.Discard excess attachment factor.Add 15 mL of HIMEC culture medium to the flask and leave it in a 37 °C incubator until ready for plating.Thaw the vial(s) of cells by immersing in a 37 °C water bath.Immediately transfer the contents of the vial using a P1000 pipette into the prepared T-75 flask containing warm HIMEC culture medium.Incubate the flask at 37 °C and 5% CO2  for 6 h.Aspirate medium and carefully add 15 mL of fresh HIMEC culture medium.Return the flask back to the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2  overnight.Exchange medium in flask with fresh HIMEC culture medium every other day until use for chip seeding. Chip activation and preparation (Day -1)  Follow instructions outlined in section D of Part I: Alveolar Lung-Chip protocol. An overview of the timeline for the Colon Intestine-Chip experimental timeline is shown in Figure 20. Chip coating with ECM (Day -1)  Follow procedure outlined in section E of Part I: Alveolar Lung-Chip protocol, with the following alterations:In steps 2–4, use colon ECM working solution for bottom channel.In steps 5 and 6, use colon ECM working solution for top channel. Prepare chips for seeding (Day 0)  Gently wash each channel of the chip with 200 μL of warm complete HIMEC culture medium.",
    "Aspirate the medium outflow at the surface of the chips, leaving the medium in the channels.Repeat the wash with an additional 200 μL of complete HIMEC culture medium per channel, leaving the excess medium outflow covering the inlet and outlet ports.Cover the 150 mm dish and place the chips in the incubator until the cells are ready for seeding. Harvest of human intestine microvascular endothelial cells (HIMECs) (Day 0)  Aspirate culture media from a T-75 flask of confluent HIMECs.Add 15 mL of DPBS to wash the culture surface and aspirate the DPBS wash.Add 3 mL of TrypLE Express to the flask and incubate for 2–3 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2  .Tap the side of the flask gently and inspect the culture under the microscope to assess complete detachment of cells from the flask surface.Add 3 mL of warm complete HIMEC culture medium to the flask and pipette gently to mix, while collecting all cells from the flask surface.Transfer the contents of the flask into a sterile 15 mL conical tube.Pipette gently to create a homogeneous mixture and transfer 20 μL of the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL tube containing the cell counting solution of 20 μL of HIMEC culture medium + 20 μL of trypan blue, making a 1:3 dilution.Mix the counting solution thoroughly and count cells using a manual hemocytometer.Count both viable and non-viable cells.Calculate percent viability of the cell solution.The expected viability of the HIMECs should be greater than 80%.Calculate viable cell concentration.Discard cell counting suspension and calculate viable cell yield.Centrifuge HIMEC suspension at 150  × g  for 5 min at room temperature.Carefully aspirate the supernatant, leaving approximately 100 μL of medium above the cell pellet. Note: The cell pellet will be very small. Aspirate carefully.  Loosen the cell pellet by flicking the tube gently.",
    "Using a P1000 pipette, gently resuspend the cells by adding 200 μL of warm complete HIMEC culture medium.Dilute with warm complete HIMEC culture medium to the required final cell density of 8 × 106  cells/mL viable HIMECs. Seed HIMECs to bottom channel (Day 0)  Bring the 120 mm dish containing the prepared chips to the BSC.Avoiding contact with the inlet and outlet ports, carefully aspirate excess medium droplets from the surface of one chip.Very gently agitate cell suspension before seeding each chip to ensure a homogeneous cell suspension.Using a pipette, pipette out the medium from the bottom channel, leaving it empty.Quickly and steadily pipette 10–15 μL of the HIMEC cell suspension into the bottom channel inlet port, while aspirating the outflow fluid from the chip surface. Avoid direct contact with the outlet port.Cover the dish and transfer to the microscope to check the seeding density within the chip (see Figure 21 for reference). Note: At this stage, optimal seeding density should form an even layer with cell-to-cell spacing of approximately half the radius of a single cell.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230102/20230102185840_3651.jpg Figure 21. Endothelial (HIMEC) optimum cell seeding density.  (A) Optimal seeding density under brightfield microscopy immediately after seeding into the bottom channel. (B) HIMECs attached on chip two hours post-seeding.If seeding density is not optimal, return the chips to the BSC and wash the channel with 200 μL of fresh medium two times. Do not aspirate the medium from the channel. Adjust cell density accordingly and repeat steps F3–F5 until the correct density is achieved within the channel.After confirming the correct cell density, seed cells in the remaining chips, invert each chip, and rest the edge of the chip carrier on the chip cradle. Note: Each chip cradle can support up to six chips inside a square cell culture dish (Figure 7).",
    "Place DPBS at the cradle to provide humidity for the cells. Replace dish lid. Note: Minimize the amount of time the cells are outside the incubator by seeding no more than 12 chips at a time and immediately placing them in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2  after seeding each batch.  Place the chips still in the dish in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2  for approximately 30 min–1 h, or until cells in the bottom channel have attached.Once HIMECs have attached (approximately 1 h post-seeding), flip the chips back to an upright position. Wash chips (Days 1 and 2)   Note: A gentle wash is performed 30 min–1 h post-seeding, once the cells have attached, to ensure that nutrients are replenished and that channels do not dry out. If cells are not attached, incubate overnight and then wash.  Gently pipette 200 μL of warm complete HIMEC culture medium to the top and bottom channels of each chip to wash. Aspirate the outflow, leaving media in the channel.Repeat the step using complete IntestiCult expansion media to wash the top channel. Harvest of colonoids (Day 0)   Note: Due to the donor-dependent protocol variation, this protocol assumes the user has in-culture expanded colonic organoid material from a primary, healthy donor. For more information on colonic organoid expansion and culture please see Sato et al. (2011) and Sontheimer-Phelps et al. (2020).  Carefully aspirate medium from each colonoid without disturbing the matrigel dome.Gently add 500 μL of cell recovery solution to each well.Scrape the matrigel using a cell scraper.Using a P1000 pipette, collect contents of each well and transfer to a cold, LoBind 15 mL conical tube.Incubate conical tube on ice for 45 min, inverting the tube every 2–5 min during this time.",
    "While cells are incubating on ice, ensure the centrifuge is cooled down to 4 °C.Centrifuge the organoid suspension at 300  × g  for 5 min at 4 °C.After centrifugation, observe the tube to confirm complete disappearance of matrigel and clear formation of a cell pellet. Note: If a thin layer of matrigel is present, remove the supernatant carefully using a P1000 pipette without disrupting the pellet and add 5 mL of new cell recovery solution. Incubate for 5 min on ice and repeat centrifugation in Step H8. If no clear pellet is formed, repeat step H8.  Once a defined cell pellet is observed, aspirate the supernatant, gently flick the tube to disrupt the pellet, and add the prepared dissociation solution, 2 mL for every 24-well plate.Incubate the conical tube in the water bath at 37 °C for 1–2 min to dissociate the organoids into fragments. Note: Incubation time will vary based on the size of organoids; however, do not incubate for longer than 2 min, as this may result in dissociation of organoids into single cells, leading to decreased seeding efficiency.  Dilute at least two times with advanced DMEM/F12 medium to wash.Centrifuge to pellet the dissociated organoids at 300  × g  for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant and adjust seeding density by suspending the pellet in IntestiCult expansion media. Adjust cell density (Day 0)  The seeding density depends on the size and density of organoids cultured on the 24-well plate. Use of two to three wells of organoids per chip has been recommended (Figure 12).To calculate volume for suspension of dissociated organoids:Chip seeding volume = 30 μL.Number of chips = 6.Volume of media required to resuspend dissociated organoids = 30 μL × 6 chips = 180 μL.",
    "Dilute the organoids with warm IntestiCult expansion media to the required final cell density (see Figure 22).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4579/bioprotoc-13-01-4579-g022.jpg Figure 22. Optimal single and fragments organoids density. (A) Low magnification; (B) Higher magnification. Note that the porous membrane is completely covered by the cells. Seed colonoids to top channel (Day 0)   Note: Work with one chip at a time. After seeding the first chip, assess cell density within the channel through the microscope, adjusting the density of the cell suspension accordingly for the subsequent chips if necessary.  Pipette out the medium from the top channel, leaving it empty.Very gently, agitate the cell suspension before seeding each chip to ensure a homogeneous mixture for even seeding.Quickly and steadily, pipette 30 μL of the cell suspension into the top channel inlet. Avoid direct contact between the aspirator tip and the outlet port.Cover the dish and transfer to the microscope to check the seeding density within the chip. Note: At the optimal seeding density, the organoid fragments will form an even cell layer on the top channel of the chip, covering the whole chip membrane (Figure 11).  If seeding density is not optimal, return the chips to the BSC and wash the channel with 200 μL of fresh medium two times. Do not aspirate the medium from the channel. Adjust cell density accordingly and repeat steps J3–J5 until the correct density is achieved within the channel.To avoid density gradient between chips, once the cells density is confirmed, transfer approximately 300 μL aliquots of the cell suspension to 1.5 mL low protein binding tubes.Seed cells in the remaining chips. Note: Minimize the amount of time the cells are outside the incubator by seeding no more than 12 chips at a time, immediately incubating them at 37 °C and 5% CO2  after seeding each batch.",
    "Place the dish of chips with a filled DPBS reservoir at 37 °C and 5% CO2  and incubate undisturbed overnight. Gas equilibration of media (Day 1)   Note: The media equilibration step is important for the success of Organ-Chip culture. Omission of this step will cause the eventual formation of bubbles in the chip, the pod, or both, which will in turn cause irregular flow and negatively impact cell viability. Minimize the time media is outside of a warmed environment to no more than 10 min, as gas equilibrium can become compromised when media is allowed to cool.  Prepare at least 3 mL of HIMEC culture medium for each chip in a 50 mL conical tube.Prepare at least 3 mL of IntestiCult expansion media for each chip in a separate 50 mL conical tube with the addition of 10 μM Y-27632, 5 μM CHIR99021, and a tracer of your choice to check the permeability. The most common one is the 3 KDa Dextran Cascade Blue at final concentration in medium of 100 µg/mL. The tracer can be kept in culture medium throughout the course of the experiment to ensure a tighter barrier function. The permeability assay section will provide further instructions. Note: Approximately 2 mL of medium will be used per reservoir of the chip. For 12 chips, prepare approximately 30 mL of medium for the top channel and 30 mL of medium for the bottom channel.  As noted above, minimize the time media is outside of the incubator during pod preparation to maintain temperature. This is a critical step to ensure success of the chips.Follow steps 3–10 in section N of Part I: Alveolar Lung-Chip protocol [Gas equilibration of media (Day 4)] to complete gas equilibration of media.",
    "Media priming of pods (Day 1)  Open the pod package and place the pods into the trays. Orient the pods with the reservoirs toward the back of the tray (Figure 9A).Pipette 2 mL of pre-equilibrated, warm media to each inlet reservoir. In the top channel inlet reservoir, add complete IntestiCult expansion medium; in the bottom channel inlet reservoir, add Complete HIMEC culture medium (Figure 9C).Pipette 300 μL of pre-equilibrated, warm media to each outlet reservoir, directly over each outlet via (Figure 9C).Follow steps 4–16 in section O of Part I: Alveolar Lung-Chip protocol [Media priming of pods (Day 4)]. Wash chips (Day 1)  Transfer the seeded chips in a 120 mm square dish from the incubator to the BSC.Wash twice the top channel of each chip with 200 μL warm equilibrated IntestiCult expansion media, aspirating the outflow from the chip surface.Wash the bottom channel of each chip with warm, equilibrated HIMEC culture medium, aspirating outflow from the chip surface.Place small droplets of equilibrated IntestiCult expansion media on all inlet and outlet ports of the top channel and HIMEC culture medium on the inlet and outlet of the bottom channel.Repeat steps M2–M4 for each chip. Chips-to-Pods (Day 1)  Follow procedure outlined in section Q of Part I: Alveolar Lung-Chip protocol [Chips-to-Pods (Day 4)]. Pods-to-Zoë (Day 1)  Follow procedure outlined in section R of Part I: Alveolar Lung-Chip protocol [Pods-to-Pods (Day 4)]. Alevolar-Chip via wash and the regulate cycle (Day 2)  Follow procedure outlined in section S of Part I: Alveolar Lung-Chip protocol [Via wash and the regulate cycle (Day 5)]. Colon-Chip via wash and the regulate cycle (Day 2)  Replenish media in the top inlet reservoir with IntestiCult maintenance media (without the addition of Y-27632 and CHIR99021 inhibitors).Add HIMEC culture medium to the bottom inlet reservoir.Replace pod lids.",
    "Inspect the chip for bubbles. Initiating mechanical stretch (Day 3)  Pause Zoë by pressing the silver “Activation” button.Using the rotary dial, highlight the “Stretch” field.Press the dial to select “Stretch” and rotate the dial clockwise to increase stretch to “2%.”Press the dial to select “Freq.” and rotate the dial clockwise to increase stretch to “0.15 Hz.” Sampling and maintenance (Day 4)  Follow protocol outlined in section V of Part I: Alveolar Lung-Chip protocol (Sampling and media replenishment). Permeability assay (Day 2+)   Notes:   This protocol is to assess the permeability of an Organ-Chip's endothelial-epithelial barrier. Apparent permeability (Papp) of tracer molecules is determined by dosing the inlet of the top channel, collecting the effluent of both top and bottom channels, and calculating the amount of compound that crossed through the membrane over time. A recommended tracer molecule is Dextran Cascade Blue 3000MW (Thermo Fisher, catalog number: D7132).   It is recommended to prepare and analyze the permeability assay samples fresh for each timepoint day.  Prepare standard curves of the fluorescent tracer molecule (i.e., Dextran Cascade Blue) used in your permeability assay in both the dosing channel media as well as receiving channel media. This is required to quantify and further analyze barrier integrity on the Organ-Chip.Start by preparing at least 500 μL of a solution of fluorescent tracer dissolved in the dosing media at the same concentration that is added to the dosing channel reservoir. (You can prepare a larger volume if needed to accommodate a greater dilution of the tracer.) Label this as  solution 1  .Label seven other tubes 2–8 and add 200 μL of the respective media (dosing or receiving channel media) to each of the tubes.Take 200 μL solution from tube 1 and add to 2, mixing evenly by pipetting up and down a few times.",
    "Then collect 200 μL from 2 and add to 3, continuing this way until you have prepared a serial dilution until tube 7. Add media without compound to tube 8, which will be used as the blank.Repeat this serial dilution for receiving channel media but start with a concentration of the fluorescent molecule that is 25% of the concentration added to the donor channel reservoir. (This is done to align the standard curve with the expected recovery concentrations.) Label tubes 9–16.Load a 96-well plate with either 50 or 100 μL (as per the requirements of your plate reader) of each of the solutions from tubes 1–16 (standards), as well as samples collected while running the barrier function assay. Load your plate and read on a plate reader.Using the standard curves generated by the plate reader, quantify the concentration of each sample, making sure to use the curve used for the media type being analyzed (e.g., top or bottom channel).A linear relationship is expected between concentration and plate reader output—check to ensure that the data is indeed linear in the concentration range being measured from the samples, especially the receiving channels, which is expected to be a much lower concentration than the donor channel.Perform a linear regression on the standard curve data to determine the equation of the form Y = m*X + b, which is needed to correlate plate reader data to concentrations.Correlate plate readings to data using the regression equation. The Emulate Standard Curve Calculator (EC003,  https://emulatebio.com/protocol-archive/ep187-v1-0[href=https://emulatebio.com/protocol-archive/ep187-v1-0]) automatically generates the standard curves and converts inputted data based on the curve generated. This calculator performs a log-log linear regression analysis, which minimizes the percent error across the full range of the standard curve data.",
    "Once all the concentrations have been calculated, Papp  can be calculated using the following equation, which accounts for any loss of compound by assuming first-order loss dynamics along the length of the chip:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4579/bioprotoc-13-01-4579-ga001.jpg where, Papp  is the apparent permeability in units of cm/s; SA  is the surface area of sections of the channels that overlap (0.17 cm2); QR  and  QD  are the fluid flow rates in the dosing and receiving channels, respectively, in units of cm3/s; CR,0  and  CD,0  are the recovered concentrations in the dosing and receiving channels, respectively, in any consistent units.The Emulate  Papp  Calculator (EC004) automatically performs this calculation (https://emulatebio.com/protocol-archive/ep187- v1-0[href=https://emulatebio.com/protocol-archive/ep187-%20v1-0]).Sample data is shown below in Figure 23 to illustrate expected Papp  over time for healthy Colon Intestine-Chips (“Control”) compared to chips with barrier disrupted by cytokine IFNγ. Seeded Colon Intestine-Chip typically forms an intact barrier around day 3–5, corresponding to apparent permeability below 1 × 10-6  cm/s (https://emulatebio.com/support/ep203-v1-0/[href=https://emulatebio.com/support/ep203-v1-0/]).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4579/bioprotoc-13-01-4579-g023.jpg Figure 23.

Intact barrier threshold marked by dotted line at y = 1 × 10-6  cm/s, which should be used as a guideline. Compared to healthy control (“Control”, blue line), cytokine treatment by IFNγ (pink line) replicates the damage of unhealthy permeable barrier (note: IFNγ treatment not included in this protocol). Increase stretch to 10% (Day 4)  Pause Zoë by pressing the silver “Activation” button.Using the rotary dial, highlight the “Stretch” field.Press the dial to select “Stretch” and rotate the dial clockwise to increase stretch to “10.0%.”Press the dial to select “Freq.” and rotate the dial clockwise to increase stretch to 10% and the frequency to 0.15 Hz.Press the “Activation” button.",
