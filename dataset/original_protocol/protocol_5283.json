    "Design and construction of sgRNA expression vectorSelection of target sequenceChoose the 20 bp target sequence in the gene or genomic region of interest (Figure 1B).Check the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence (5’-NGG-3’) at the 3’-end of the target sequence.To induce a dysfunctional mutation in the gene, the target sequence should be designed near the 5’-end or in the functional domain.Avoid poly-T sequences, which work as transcriptional terminators for sgRNA; ensure that the G + C content is 40-80%.If the target site includes the recognition site of a restriction enzyme, it will be possible to perform restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis for genotyping. Note: It has been reported that truncated sgRNA could decrease off-target effects (Fu et al., 2014). We confirmed that truncated sgRNA (18 or 17 bp target sequences) works in our system; however, we have not yet evaluated their targeting efficiency. Add the following adapter sequence for cloning (Figure 1B): 5’-TCTG-3’ for sense oligonucleotides and 5’-AAAC-3’ for anti-sense oligonucleotides.Digestion of pSCgRNA vector (Figure 1C)Prepare the digestion mixture, as given below:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615220002_0698.jpgIncubate the mixture at 37 °C for 3 h.Purify the BbsI-digested pSCgRNA vector using the DNA purification kit (Favorgen GEL/PCR Purification Mini Kit).Annealing of oligonucleotides (Figure 1C)Prepare the annealing mixture, as given below:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615220117_0485.jpgIncubate at 95 °C for 5 min in a thermal cycler.Remove the tube from the thermal cycler and allow the mixture to cool down on the bench at 20-25 °C for 30 min.Cloning of annealed oligonucleotides into pSCgRNA vector (Figure 1C)Prepare the ligation mixture, as given below:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615220206_9974.jpgIncubate the mixture at 16 °C for 3 h or more.Transform DH5α-competent cells using 2 µl ligation mixture and spread on an LB plate with 50 µg/ml ampicillin. Incubate the LB plate at 37 °C for 14-16 h.Mix a PCR reaction mixture, using the ScU6p Ins.",
    "check F primer (as the forward primer) and the antisense target sequence (as the reverse primer).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615220305_0301.jpgVerify the insertion by performing a colony PCR with the following cycle:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615220337_1450.jpgNote: If the cloning is successful, a 950 bp band will be amplified and detected (Figure 1D). We recommend testing at least 8-16 colonies.Grow the positive colonies in liquid LB medium with 50 µg/ml ampicillin. Purify the plasmids using a plasmid DNA mini prep kit (Favorgen Plasmid DNA Extraction Mini Kit).Confirm the inserted target sequence in the pSCgRNA vector using ScU6p Seq. check F primer using Sanger sequencing.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615205240_3389.jpgFigure 1.

M: DNA ladder markers.PEG-mediated protoplast transformation (Figure 2A)Purify the pSCgRNA containing the target sequence and pSCOE1-fcoCas9, which backbone is pTN182 vector (Sakakibara et al., 2008), using the midi prep kit (NucleoBond® Xtra Midi) and dilute it with sterile TE buffer at 1 µg/µl. Use 15 µg of each plasmid for transformation.Co-transform both the vectors using the PEG-mediated protoplast transformation method, as described in a previous report (Nishiyama et al., 2000; PHYSCOmanual ver. 2.0 in NIBB PHYSCObase website: http://moss.nibb.ac.jp/protocol.html[href=http://moss.nibb.ac.jp/protocol.html]).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615010248_6590.jpgFigure 2. Overview of protocol for acquiring mutant strains using RGENsRegeneration of protonemal cells and transient screening using antibiotic G418 (Geneticin). After inoculating the transformed protoplasts in PRM/T on cellophane and on a PRM/B plate, incubate the mixture at 25 °C for 7 d in a plant growth chamber (Figure 2B).For transient screening, transfer the regenerated protonemata from the protoplasts in PRM/T on cellophane to new BCDAT plates with 20 µg/ml G418 (Figure 2C).",
    "Culture the plates in a plant growth chamber for 5 d (Figures 2C and 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615010643_6177.jpgFigure 3. Example of protonemata after transient screening (PpFtsZ2-1 targeted). A. Representative example of dead protonemata; B. Representative example of surviving protonemata. Strain also shows the phenotype of PpFtsZ2-1 mutation. Scale bars = 50 µm.Transfer the surviving protonemata in PRM/T on cellophane to new BCDAT plates and culture again until small colonies have formed (Figure 2D).Using tweezers, choose the protonemata at the edge of the colonies and transfer them to new, numbered BCDAT or BCDAT + 0.5% glucose plates (Figure 2D).For genotyping, culture the protonemata until the colonies become 5-10 mm in diameter. Note: There is a possibility that the acquired strain is a mosaic plant, which is a mixture of strains with different mutations or wild type. If so, we can isolate the monogenic strain from the protoplast, single protonemal branch, or leaf of the gametophore.GenotypingGreen PCRTransfer a pinch of fresh protonemata to PCR tubes (Figure 4A) and grind using the tip of the 200 µl pipette chip into 50 µl lysis buffer (see Recipes) (Figure 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615010832_2321.jpgFigure 4. Preparation of the template for Green PCR. A. A pinch of fresh protonemata in the lysis buffer; B. Protonemata crushed by the tip of the 200 µl chip in the lysis buffer.Incubate at 95 °C for 10 min.Spin down the debris at 3,500 x g for 10 sec and use the supernatant as the PCR template.Design the primer set using free online tool Primer 3 (http://primer3.ut.ee/[href=http://primer3.ut.ee/]) for amplifying the genomic DNA, including the target site for sequencing or for other genotyping such as RFLP.PreparePCR reaction mixture, as given below:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615220444_7780.jpgAmplify the PCR product, including the target site of the genome, with the cycle given below:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170615/20170615220514_2038.",
    "jpgRestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysisIf the target site includes the recognition site of a restriction enzyme, it will be possible to observe the targeted mutagenesis by RFLP.After confirming the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis, digest the PCR products using the corresponding restriction enzymes.After sufficient digestion, analyze the enzyme-treated and untreated PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis. It is possible that restriction enzyme-tolerant PCR products have mutations.Note: If a mixture of PCR products derived from wild type and mutant strains is used, the targeted mutagenesis can be checked using the T7 endonuclease I or cel1 assay, which can recognize and cleave non-perfectly matched DNA. As high throughput and comprehensive genotyping method, high resolution melting analysis or next-generation sequencing is also applicable. Sequencing of target sites in the genomeAfter confirming the PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis, clone the PCR products into the sequencing vector using the Zero Blunt PCR Cloning Kit or the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit.After colony PCR and mini prep, check the DNA sequence of the inserted PCR product of several clones by Sanger sequencing.Note: If the PCR product is present as a single band in monogenic plant, it will be possible to check by direct sequencing."
