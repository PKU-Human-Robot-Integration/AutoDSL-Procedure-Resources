  "procedures": [
    "All fish-related procedures were carried out with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Harvard Medical School.\n1. Tool and Reagent Preparation\nMake a wire loop to chop embryos\nTake 20 cm of stainless steel wire that is stiff and non-corrosive with a diameter of 40 μm. Loop the wire through into glass capillary (1.0 mm outer diameter, 0.5 mm inner diameter, no filament), making a small loop at the top (loop length is 1.0 mm)\nPut a little droplet of clear nail polish onto the tip of the glass capillary between the wire loop to hold it in place. Let dry. Make sure not to get any nail polish onto the loop portion, as it may damage the embryos.\nAttach the glass capillary with the loop onto a wooden chopstick (9” bamboo disposable chopsticks broken in half) using lab tape. Leave about 2.5 cm of the glass capillary extending beyond the chopstick, so that the chopstick part of the tool does not dip into the water. Adjust this length to preference.\nAlternatively, make a glass needle to chop embryos\nPinch one end of glass Pasteur pipette with forceps, while holding the other side with a hand. Heat the thin part of the pipette over a spirit lamp or Bunsen burner.\nHand-pull the glass pipette. The ideal pipette as a diameter of approximately 30 μm and a gentle curve (radius of curvature = approximately 5 mm). Proper diameter and curvature is obtained with practice and some chance.\nPrepare methyl cellulose",
    "Methyl cellulose is used to hold the embryos while chopping. Make 2% methyl cellulose solution in ⅓x Ringer’s solution (116 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; pH 7.2)). Shake methyl cellulose powder in ⅓x Ringer’s solution at 4 °C overnight.\nOptionally, add ~1.5 mL phenol red (0.5% in DPBS stock solution) to 10 mL 2% methyl cellulose solution, until red, to make the solution visible. Shake it until the color becomes uniform.\n2. Preparation of Zebrafish Embryos for Surgical Size Reduction\nCollect embryos\nPlace one or two male and one or two female zebrafish in a mating chamber filled with a lot of water. Separate males and females using a plastic divider. Use the AB line for somite imaging (section 4) and a transgenic reporter line of neural tube patterning (nkx2.2:mem-gfp, dbx1b:gfp, or Olig2:dsred) for neural tube imaging. Leave them in the chamber overnight.\nNOTE: The choice of adults is important for obtaining eggs that survive surgery well. Typically, young healthy females produce healthy eggs.\nOn the next morning, transfer the chamber into shallow water and place the chamber with slight tilt. Remove the divider so the fish can mate.\nCollect the eggs by pouring into a tea strainer. Transfer the eggs into a Petri dish with egg water (for 20x egg water, 6 g instant sea salt, 1.5 g CaSO4 and 1 L H2O; use at 1x). For better staging, collect the eggs right after spawning. Place the embryos in a 28.5 °C incubator.\nIf necessary, inject morpholino, mRNA, etc., at 1–4 cell stages following a common protocol7,8. Inject mRNA for fluorescent membrane label (mem-mCherry, mem-mBFP1, or mem-mCitrine) for neural tube imaging (section 5).\nDechorionate using pronase",
    "Around the 128-cell to 256-cell stage, transfer healthy embryos to a 35 mm glass dish filled with egg water. Remove as much egg water as possible from the dish.\nAdd 1 mL of 20 mg/mL pronase. Gently swirl embryos around by moving the plate and gently pipette the solution up and down to help dechorionation using a glass pipette.\nWhen the chorions start to lose elasticity (usually 1-4 min after addition of pronase, depending on the amount of eggs and water), add as much egg water as possible to dilute pronase. Assess elasticity loss by gently touching the chorion with forceps; the chorion should  hold the dent without immediately bouncing back. Transfer the eggs to another dish with egg water using a glass pipette (at this point, most of the chorions are not broken).\n\t\t\nAlternatively, gently pour the embryos from the dish into a large 400 mL glass beaker filled with egg water without exposing embryos to air. Then, let the embryos completely settle. Tilt the beaker to let embryos fall to one side. Collect these embryos using a glass pipette and transfer to a new 35 mm glass dish filled with ⅓x Ringer’s solution.\nWait for several minutes until most of the chorions lose elasticity completely. Remove the remaining chorions from embryos by gently pipetting the eggs. Remove damaged embryos and incubate the embryos in a 28.5 °C incubator.\n3. Surgical Size Reduction and Recovery\nPrepare one clean 35 mm glass dish. Spread approximately 0.5 mL of 2% methyl cellulose (in ⅓x Ringer’s solution, with phenol red to help visualize) near the center of the bottom of the larger dish using a plastic spatula. Thinly and evenly spread the methyl cellulose to a thickness of approximately 0.5 mm.",
    "Pour approximately 30 mL of ⅓x Ringer’s solution to the side of the dish and allow to spread onto the rest of the dish, covering the methyl cellulose.\nPlace dechorionated embryos at the 256-cell-1k-cell stage on 2% methyl cellulose. Adjust the orientation of the embryos onto the side to visualize both the cells and the yolk. (Figure 1)\nChop approximately 30%-40% of cells from the blastoderm near the animal pole by cutting perpendicular to the animal-vegetal axis using the wire loop (or the glass needle) (Figure 1, top panels). After removing the cells, gently tap the ends together to help the remaining cells stick back. Within minutes, the dead cells should slough off when the embryo starts to heal.\nMake a small wound to the yolk near the vegetal pole instead of “chopping” the yolk (Figure 1 middle panels). Wound the yolk by nicking the egg membrane with the mounted wire. Yolk will ooze out for few minutes after wounding, and then the wound will heal (Figure 1 bottom panels).\nWhen the yolk stops oozing out, move the embryo using a pipet outside of the methyl cellulose in the same dish to allow them to better recover.\nRepeat steps 3.4­-3.6 for all embryos. Leave the dish stable for 30 min while the embryos recover.\nTransfer the embryos to a new dish with fresh ⅓x Ringer’s solution and put them in 28.5 °C incubator to allow them to completely recover.\n(Optional) If the stage of interest is the early somite stage, embryos can be incubated at 20 °C after being incubated at 28.5 °C until the shield stage, to adjust timing for experimentation and imaging.\n4. Live Imaging of Zebrafish Somitogenesis",
    "Prepare 100 mL of 1% agarose solution by adding 1 g of agarose to 100 mL of egg water, heating until agarose is fully dissolved. Let cool for 5-10 min to a temperature of 62-72 °C.\nPrepare a mount for imaging.\n\tNOTE: This guide was developed for use with an inverted wide-field microscope.\n\t\nPour ~15 mL of 1% agarose in to a 100 mm x 15 mm plastic Petri dish.\nGently place a Dorsal Mount V1 mold template5 onto the bottom of the Petri dish. Keep the mold on the bottom by using a weight, such as 15 mL tube with water.\nNOTE: This is so the embryos are as close to the bottom of the Petri dish as possible, when using an inverted microscope. Although the embryos are mounted laterally for somite imaging, here Dorsal Mount V15 is used since it holds the embryos better at early somite stages.\nLet cool until agarose is fully solidified. Pour in ~30 mL of egg water with 0.01% tricaine, and carefully remove mold by gently prying off with forceps.\nMount embryos for somite imaging\nPrepare 1% Low Melting Agarose in ⅓x Ringer’s solution (or egg water) and keep it at 42 °C. Wait until the temperature comes down to 42 °C.\nUnder a dissection microscope, place one embryo per well. Pipette approximately 1 μL of Low Melting Agarose in the well to finely adjust the well size to the size of individual embryos that vary in size, especially between those with and without size reduction.",
    "Quickly orient the embryos before the Low Melting Agarose is solidified so the embryos face completely laterally to the dish. After mounting embryos, gently place the cover slip in the agarose mount to hold the embryos in place. The orientation is particularly important for the long-term somite imaging because the embryos have to be exactly laterally mounted for all the somite boundaries to be clearly imaged at later stages.\nSubmerge away from the mounting area and manipulate a 25 mm x 25 mm cover glass such that it is 45 degrees offset from the orientation of the square indent made by the mold. Slide the coverslip over the mold in this orientation until each corner is resting of a different side of the mold.\nNOTE: Although this protocol is for an inverted microscope, placing a cover glass on top of the mold is still important so that the embryos do not move while transferring to the microscope.\nImaging somite formation process\nPrewarm the microscope to 28 °C in an incubator built with foamcore boards and a cabinet heater.\nPlace the Petri dish with the mounted embryos onto the microscope stage. Find the embryo mounted in the top-left well of the agarose mount with lower magnification lens, then switch the objective to 10x.\nSet up image acquisition.\nNOTE: This instruction is for bright field.\nFind conditions for the light power, exposure time, and condenser so that the somite boundary can be clearly seen. Using z-stack settings set the lowest and highest desired imaging plane. Set the total time and time interval. Find and register the xy positions of all the embryos mounted so multiple embryos can be timelapse imaged at once.\nMeasure the lengths of PSM and somites using Fiji16.\n5. Imaging of Neural Tube Patterning",
    "Prepare 100 mL of 1% agarose solution by adding 1 g of agarose to 100 mL of egg water, heating until agarose is fully dissolved. Let cool for 5-10 min to 62-72 °C. Adjust tricaine to 0.01%.\nPrepare a dorsal mount for imaging.\n\tNOTE: This guide is developed for use with an upright fluorescence microscope. For inverted microscopes coverslip bottom dishes are necessary and mounting orientation in step 3 is flipped.\n\t\nPour in ~15 mL of 1% agarose in to a 100 mm x 15 mm plastic Petri dish. Gently float a Dorsal Mount V1 mold on the surface of the agarose to avoid introducing air bubbles. Let cool until agarose is fully solidified.\nCarefully remove the mold with forceps or a razor blade. Fill the dish with egg water with 0.01% tricaine and cover until use.\nMount embryos for neural tube imaging.\nAllow transgenic or injected fluorescent size-reduced and control embryos to develop until the 20-25 somite stage (roughly 18-22 h after fertilization). Embryos expressing a fluorescent membrane label (mem-mCherry, mem-mBFP1, or mem-mCitrine) and a transgenic reporter of neural tube patterning (nkx2.2:mem-gfp, dbx1b:gfp, or Olig2:dsred) are used for imaging.\nReplace egg water medium in prepared dorsal mount with 0.01% tricaine working solution. Gently pipette in embryos to be imaged in to wells of the dorsal mount.\nManipulate embryos into the correct orientation such that the head is facing forward in the mount and the tail is pointing towards the rear with the dorsal portion facing towards the water surface.",
    "Orient the embryo such that the tail is lying flat and not pointed downward towards the bottom of the dish. It is sometimes helpful to rest the posterior portion of the tail on the side ledge of the mounting well to prevent the tail from sinking and inadvertently imaging the hindbrain. Repeat for each embryo. Make certain with size reduced embryos that they do not fall to deeply into the wells to be imaged.\nSubmerge away from the mounting area and manipulate a 25 mm x 25 mm cover glass such that it is 45° offset from the orientation of the square indent made by the mold. Slide the coverslip over the mold in this orientation until each corner is resting of a different side of the mold.\nSlowly rotate the coverglass until it gently falls on to the mounting area. Check to be sure embryos are still mounted in the correct positions and orientations. If too much movement is caused by the falling of the coverglass, remove gently and repeat mounting from step C.\nImage in 3-D the developing spinal cord.\nGently transport the dish containing mounted embryos to the confocal microscope. For long-term live imaging, be sure to use an incubated microscope. Otherwise, low temperatures are tolerable.\nUnder brightfield illumination, navigate to the embryo to image and center the field of view on the preferred anterior-posterior position. To enable a detailed comparison between embryos, this position on each embryo must be consistent.\nSet the imaging parameters to excite and capture signal from the fluorescent proteins being imaged. Parameters can be tuned by eye to create a desired image on the initial sample. To enable measurement consistency, apply these settings to all embryos in the dataset. If many z-stacks are required optimize settings for speed.",
    "Using z-stack settings, set the lowest and highest desired imaging plane. For optimal image quality in the z-stack, set the z-resolution to the highest that is optimal for the aperture setting. Good images can be generated with 1 μm z-spacing.\nAnalyze imaging data by any preferred method.\nNOTE: In this case, analysis was performed with custom MATLAB scripts that enable simple segmentation of the neural portions of an image and quantification of imaging signal.\nSubscription Required.
