    "Animal Ethics Statement - Experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and an approved animal research protocol by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of California, Irvine, an AAALAC accredited institution. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.\n1. Preparation of Lysis Buffers\nPrepare \"Soluble\" lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% Triton-X 100, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) and sterile filter through 0.22 µm filter.\n\t\nFor a working \"Soluble\" lysis buffer, measure N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) and thoroughly dissolve in 100 mM phenylmethysulfonyl flouride (PMSF) dissolved in 100% EtOH.\n\t\tNOTE: Lysis Buffer Inhibitors: (i) 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM); (ii) 0.2 mM PMSF; (iii) 1 mM Sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4); (iv) 1 µg/mL leupeptin; (v) 1 µg/mL aprotinin; (vi) 20 mM Sodium fluoride (NaF).\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear a face mask when working with NEM throughout the protocol. Working lysis buffer must be made fresh to ensure active inhibitors.\nFor soluble lysis buffer with protease inhibitors, add inhibitors in the following order: Sodium Fluoride (NaF), up to volume with cold lysis buffer, Sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), Aprotinin, and Leupeptin.\nFor \"Insoluble\" lysis buffer, supplement to 4% SDS by adding 500 µL of 20% SDS to 2 mL of \"Soluble\" lysis buffer. Leave at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: SDS will precipitate out when kept at 4 °C ; keep this at room temp. Final Lysis Buffer composition: 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4); 1% Triton X-100; 150 mM NaCl; 10% glycerol; 4% SDS (Insoluble Only).\n2. Soluble/Insoluble Fractionation Protocol\nNOTE: See Figure 1 for a schematic.\nLabel two sets of tubes for each sample: \"Soluble\" and \"Insoluble.\"\nAdd X-µL of ice-cold working soluble lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (see 1.1.1) to tissue.",
    "NOTE: X = Volume varies depending on tissue amount; See Table 1.\nFor mouse brain tissue (i.e., striatum), dounce slowly 30 times in glass 1 mL douncer and pipet into \"Insoluble\" labeled tube (keep on ice).\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to break surface of liquid after starting douncing, as bubbles will form and may yield incomplete homogenization.\nFor cells (i.e., HeLa, HEK293T), rinse cells once with cold, 1x PBS. Remove PBS and apply minimal volume of lysis buffer to cells and lift with cell scraper.\n\tNOTE: For above cell lines, cells were plated at 5 x 105 cells per 6 well plate and grown to near confluency. One well is comparable to volumes used for mouse striatum.\nTransfer homogenate or cell lysate into labeled, \"Insoluble\" tubes and lyse on ice 1 h (Start clock after final tube is processed).\n\tNOTE: For cell lysates, triturate several times to break up cell clumps prior to starting incubation. Avoid formation of bubbles. Briefly vortex pulse each sample for 1 s halfway through lysing.\nCentrifuge samples at 4 °C at 15,000 x g for 20 min.\nRecover supernatant as the \"Soluble\" fraction.\n\t\nRemove with pipet, be careful not to disturb pellet/cloudy layer as this will contaminate the fraction. Pipet soluble fraction into \"Soluble\" labeled tube. Keep on ice.\nWash pellet with 500 µL of lysis buffer (x2) and centrifuge at 4 °C at 15,000 x g for 5 min after each wash; it is okay if some of the cloudy layer is pipetted off.\nAfter final wash, remove ALL remaining wash buffer leaving only the tissue pellet.\n\tNOTE: From this point, insoluble samples should now be kept at room temperature.\nResuspend pellet with X-µL lysis buffer supplemented with 4% SDS (Volume can be adjusted depending on pellet size; see Table 1).",
    "Sonicate each sample for 30 s at room temperature with a probe sonicator (125 Watts, 20 kHz, Pulse, Amplitude 40%, see Table of Materials).\nBoil samples (rolling boil) for 30 min; Centrifuge briefly (15 s) at 6,000 x g as to not lose any sample.\nPerform DC (detergent compatible) protein assay (see Table of Materials) or Lowry protein assay to measure protein concentration (recommended started dilutions of 1/5 of sample in respective lysis buffer for cell culture and 1/10 for tissue lysates).\n\tNOTE: Protein concentrations will have to be read using a DC or Lowry assay due to high detergent concentration.\nAliquot samples into 50 µL batches to avoid freeze-thaw issues.\n\tNOTE: Protocol can be paused here prior to further biochemical analysis by storing both fractions at -20 °C.\n3. Western Blot and Quantification\nPerform western blots as reported elsewhere1,13 by diluting 30 µg of sample 1:1 in loading buffer (1.6x loading dye, 1x reducing).\n\tNOTE: 30 µg of protein per fraction is sufficient, but can be adjusted for optimal resolution. 3 - 8% Tris-Acetate poly-acrylamide gels should be used for the insoluble fraction. 4 - 12% Bis-Tris gels are recommended for the soluble fraction.\nBoil samples (rolling boil) for 5 min. Centrifuge briefly (15 s) at 6,000 x g to collect sample.\nAnalyze fractions by SDS-PAGE and western blot, according to manufacturer's protocol for reduced samples.\n\tNOTE: Insoluble fraction resolves best when transferred onto 0.45 µM nitrocellulose membrane. 0.45 or 0.2 µM nitrocellulose can be used for the soluble fraction, depending on the size of the protein of interest. Some optimization may be required for best transfer of HMW materials.\nStain membrane with whole protein stain (e.g., MEMcode, see the Table of Materials) to visualize protein loading efficiency.",
    "NOTE: Western blots can be analyzed by mean pixel intensity. Soluble fractions can be normalized to a house-keeping protein best suited for the experimental system. Insoluble fraction as relative protein abundance was verified by reversible protein staining or Histone 3 normalization on separate blot.\nSubscription Required.
