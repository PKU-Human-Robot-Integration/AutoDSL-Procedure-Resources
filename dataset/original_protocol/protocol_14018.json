    "The present study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Friendship Hospital Capital Medical University.\n1. Diagnosis of the osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) by X-ray fluoroscopy, magnetic resonance image (MRI), bone scintigraphy, and symptoms\nIdentify patients who have OVCF by older patients with back pain, tenderness in the spinous process, paraspinal muscles at back, etc.\nUse posterioanterior X-ray fluoroscopy to check if patient has vertebral compression fracture.\nUse an MRI to diagnosis whether a patient has a newly onset vertebral compression fracture, and determine the target compressed vertebrae. For patients who cannot undergo the MRI, use bone scintigraphy.\nOrder PVP treatment for the patient who has an acute vertebral compression fracture and record the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and Oawestry Disability Index (ODI)8.\n\tNOTE: There are a few criteria for inclusion: 1) vertebra fractured patient whether having history of a low-energy trauma or not; 2) no history or evidence of metabolic bone disease or cancer; 3) VAS score â‰¥ 7; 4) diagnosis as vertebral fracture by X-ray, MRI or bone scintigraphy.\n2. Preoperative localization of target vertebra\nBefore the operation, conduct prone computer tomography on the patient with three radiopaque markers placed in the midline of patient's back skin at the compressed vertebral level. While pressing the most painful part, confirm the target area by x-ray fluoroscopy and a physical examination on the patient's back.\nBefore the prone computer tomography scan, put a gradienter on the patient's back just inferior to the fixed markers. Record the patient's body position and then remove it. Have the patient stay in the same position during surgery.",
    "Save the CT images (1 mm scanning layer thickness, 1 mm layer spacing, and either 90 slices (conventional scanning) or 400 slices (thin slice scanning) in a DICOM format. Put a cotton pad on the patient's back to ensure that the markers remain until the operation.\n3. Simulating the percutaneous vertebroplasty procedure in the computer software\nExport the CT images in DICOM format into medical imaging processing software (e.g., MIMICS) and select the target slices to reconstruct the compressed vertebra.\nSelect Threshold Segmentation to adjust the threshold range for the target vertebra from 125-3071H and create a mask. Press Duplicate Mask to make two masks: Mask A and Mask B.\nClick Mask Edit to erase the target vertebra in Mask A. Then click Boolean Operations to form a new Mask C by using Mask B to minus Mask A. Press Calculate 3D from Mask to reconstruct the target vertebra.\nSimulate PVP via a bilateral transpedicular approach in the software. First, define the Medcad cylinder in the software as the puncture needle model. Define the cylinders as the same length and radius as the puncture needle (a length of 125 mm and a radius of 1.25 mm).\nSimulate the entry point, the entry angle (head inclination angle and abduction angle orientation), and the puncture needle depth for a real PVP with the 3-D views of the target vertebra.\nAdjust the puncture needles to its ideal position by using the Move and Rotate function. Keep needle trajectories consistent with these principles: 1) the puncture needles can extrapolate through the pedicle, preferably in its superior half; 2) the ideal location of the tips is at the point within the anterior one third of the vertebral body on the lateral view.\n4. Three-dimensional printing guide template",
    "Save all of the 3D template data and send it in the MCS format to a three-dimensional printing company.\nConvert MCS format data into a STL format and design the template using software. Reconstruct the base, which must cling to patient's back skin, reconstruct the trajectory canal according to all of the parameters, including skin entry points, entry angles and the depth of the two needles' trajectory, print two same templates out for the operation.\n\tNOTE: The guide template is made from polylactic acid, which can be sterilized and by low temperature steam disinfection.\n5. Applying the three-dimensional printing guide template to assist the real PVP operation\nMake the patient lie prone on the operation table as for the CT scanning in accordance with the gradienter record. Measure the distance of the three radiopaque markers and draw the outline of the three markers to match the template with the target location.\nMatch a skin template along with the skin outline. Insert and press two swabs through the needle's trajectories on the template to mark the insertion points on the skin. Then remove the template and draw the points as point A and B.\nRemove the template and disinfect the skin. Drape the area and put the tips of two puncture needles at the insertion points (point A and B). Then, use the anteroposterior view of C-arm fluoroscopy to confirm whether the puncture points determined by template are feasible.\nGive the patient local anesthesia by injecting a 5 mL mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1% ropavicaine at each puncture point. Fix another sterilized template on the patient's back by sterilized film.",
    "Tap the two needles into the target vertebra slightly via insertions through the guiding cylinders of the template. Verify with the C-arm fluoroscope that the trajectories are suitable for insertion. Make sure that the punctuation is within the pedicles and then tap the needles to advance further until the end of the trajectory.\nWhen the whole needles are completely inserted into the guiding cylinders, verify with the C-arm fluoroscope that the needle tips have reached their ideal location.\nInject bone cement into the vertebral body through the needles. Inject 2 mL of bone cement via each trajectory for a total of 4 mL of bone cement to the vertebra.\nFinally, use fluoroscopy to check the distribution of the bone cement within the vertebral body by anteroposterior and lateral views. Stitch the insertions.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
