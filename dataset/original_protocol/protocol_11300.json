    "All experiments using live animals must be conducted in accordance with animal use and care guidelines and regulations. The procedures described in this study were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health regulations concerning the care and use of experimental animals and with the approval of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Evaluation of \"bursting permeability\" using live animal imaging\nTransplantation of syngeneic breast tumors into mouse hosts with fluorescent macrophages\nGenerate pieces of tumor tissue suitable for transplantation.\n\t\t\nGenerate fluorescently-labeled tumors in mouse mammary cancer models by crossing the spontaneous, autochthonous, genetically engineered mouse mammary cancer model MMTV-PyMT mice with transgenic mice expressing fluorescent reporters38,39 [e.g., enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP), or Dendra2].\nAllow the MMTV-PyMT mice with fluorescently labeled tumors to grow to a size of no larger than 2 cm (approximately 10-12 weeks of age).\nEuthanize the tumor bearing MMTV-PyMT mice by placing them into a chamber with 5% isoflurane until 30 seconds after all respirations stop.\nPerform a cervical dislocation.\nRemove hair from the euthanized mouse’s abdomen using a topical depilatory cream.\nPlace a Petri dish with DMEM/F12 cell culture medium on ice.\nPlace the mouse and Petri dish on ice into the fume hood.\nSanitize the mouse’s abdomen with 70% ethyl alcohol.\nUsing sterile gloves and surgical tools (sterilized scissors, forceps, and blade) remove the tumors and place them into the Petri dish.\nCut up the tumor into small pieces (~2 mm x 2 mm x 2mm in size), discarding any necrotic portions, while they are in the Petri dish.\nTransplant the tumor pieces into recipient hosts.\n\t\t\nRaise mice with genetically engineered fluorescently-labeled macrophages, e.g., MacGreen40 or MacBlue 41 mice (Csf1r-GAL4VP16/UAS-ECFP)",
    "Allow the FVB mice with fluorescently labeled macrophages to grow to an age of ~4-6 weeks).\nAnesthetize the FVB mice with fluorescently labeled macrophages in a chamber using 5% isoflurane with oxygen as a carrier gas.\nReduce the anesthesia to ~3% isoflurane and apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes of the mouse to prevent drying.\nRemove hair from over the 4th mammary gland of the mouse.\nClean the skin with betadine. It is important to maintain sterile conditions throughout the rest of the procedure. This includes using sterilized instruments and reagents.\nMake a small incision ~2-3 mm just inferior to the 4th nipple.\nDissect until the mammary fat pad is exposed.\nTake a tumor piece from the Petri dish and coat in artificial extracellular matrix.\nTransplant tumors underneath the 4th mammary fat pad.\nClose the incision using cyanoacrylate adhesive.\nContinuously monitor the animal until it fully recovers from anesthesia and is able to maintain sternal recumbency. Also, do not to return the animal to the company of other animals until full recovery.\nTo minimize infections, add 1 mL of 100 mg/mL enrofloxacin antibiotic to the animal's drinking water bottle (8 fl oz).\nAllow tumors to grow until palpable (~5 mm; ~4 weeks).\nDepending on the experiment, allocate the mice into treatment groups, and perform the corresponding treatments, if applicable.\nSetup for intravital imaging       \nTurn on microscope's two-photon laser and detectors.\nTurn on the heating box and pre-heat the microscope's x-y stage.\nPlace the custom-made stage insert42 into the x-y stage.\nPreparation of imaging window\nPrior to setting up for imaging, autoclave the custom-made circular imaging window frame42.\nUse a pipette or an insulin syringe to place a thin layer of cyanoacrylate adhesive to the window frame and affix in place an 8 mm circular cover glass.",
    "NOTE: 1) It is important to avoid getting residue on the clear aperture of the cover glass. 2) It is important to adhere the cover glass to the window frame at least 1 h before use for imaging.\nCarefully wipe clean any excess cyanoacrylate on the clear aperture of the cover glass using a laboratory wipe wetted with a small amount of acetone.\nPreparation of tail vein catheter for administration of fluids and fluorescent dyes during imaging\nCut a 30 cm piece of polyethylene tubing to construct a tail vein catheter.\nDetach the needle portion of a 30 G needle from its Luer taper by gently bending the needle back and forth until it breaks.\n\t\tNOTE: The needle should be held close to the Luer taper and not the needle tip. This can be performed with pliers or forceps to grasp the needle in order to prevent needle stick injury.\nInsert the blunt end of the needle into one end of the polyethylene tubing.\nInsert the sharp end of another 30 G needle, keeping its Luer taper attached, to the opposite end of the tubing.\nFill a 1 cc syringe with phosphate buffered saline, attach it to Luer taper of the assembled catheter, and flush the tail vein catheter making sure that there are no air bubbles in the system.\nFor vascular labeling, fill a 1 cc syringe with 100 μL of 10 mg/kg 155 kDa dextran-tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) or quantum dots.\nPreparation of mouse for imaging\nAnesthetize the mouse in a cage underneath (~1 foot below) a heat lamp using 4%-5% isoflurane mixed with 100% oxygen set to a flow of 1.5-2 L per min.\nTurn on heat lamp over surgical working area. This step is critical for maintaining the core physiologic body temperature of the mouse during the surgery.",
    "Place the mouse under the heat lamp and lower the anesthesia to 2%-3% for the duration of the surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: Be sure to keep the heat lamp at a safe distance (~1 foot) away from the mouse to avoid overheating.\nPlace ophthalmic ointment on the mouse’s eyes to prevent drying of the eyes and blindness.\nTest that the mouse is anesthetized by performing toe-pinch test. If animal withdraws, increase dosage of isoflurane by 1% and retest in 1-2 min.\nInsert the tail vein catheter into the most distal point on the tail possible.\nAffix the tail vein catheter to the tail with a small piece of lab tape that wraps around the tail and sticks to the needle to insure it does not get dislodged.\nInject 50 μL per h of PBS through the tail vein catheter to provide adequate hydration. It is critical to avoid injecting too much fluid (no more than 200 μL per h) or any bubbles into the catheter as this can be fatal to the mouse.\nRemove hair on the abdomen over the 4th and 5th mammary glands using depilatory cream.\nClean the skin with betadine and allow skin to dry.\nMake a longitudinal midline incision starting immediately superior to the genitals and carry the incision up to the level of the superior aspect of the 4th mammary gland.\nCarry the incision transverse to the superior aspect of the 4th mammary gland. It is critical to avoid compromising the blood supply at this point.\nDissect the mammary fat pad off the peritoneum creating a tissue flap using sterile forceps and scissors.",
    "NOTE: Skin flap imaging is susceptible to significant motion artifacts and tissue dehydration. These are avoided, as described previously43,44, by affixing a rigid piece of rubber behind to the skin side of the flap (to stiffen the soft tissue and isolate it from the rest of the body) and then placing the tumor into a shallow imaging window to preserve the hydration. This is critical for stable imaging as the tumor and surrounding tissue in this setting are very compliant.\nStabilize the skin flap by affixing (with cyanoacrylate glue) a small piece of rigid rubber measuring 2 cm x 2 cm to the skin side of the flap. The tumor should be in the center of the area being stabilized by the rubber.\nKeep exposed tissue hydrated with drops of PBS.\nApply a small film of cyanoacrylate to the outer rim of the custom-made imaging window frame.\nApply a small droplet of PBS (~10–20 μL) to the center of the cover glass.\nDry the surrounding flap tissue with a laboratory wipe. It is critical to make sure that the cyanoacrylate on the window frame does not come into contact with the PBS on the glass, as this can cause the cyanoacrylate to polymerize and set prematurely.\nAffix the small imaging window to the tissue flap with the tumor at the center of the clear aperture.\nRemove the heating box from the stage.\nTransfer the anesthetized mouse and tail vein catheter to the microscope stage. Use extreme caution to ensure the tail vein catheter does not fall out.\nPlace mouse on the stage in the prone position.\nPlace the nose cone of isoflurane over the snout to ensure maintenance of anesthesia.\nInsert the window into the bore on the custom x-y stage plate.",
    "Place the heating box back onto the stage to maintain a physiological temperature.\nMonitor the animal's vital signs by attaching a pulse oximeter probe via clip sensor to the back paw.\nSlowly decrease isoflurane to 0.5%-1% to maintain adequate blood flow and avoid over anesthetizing the mouse.\nIntravital imaging\n\tNOTE: The imaging we describe in this section was performed on a custom-built two-laser multiphoton microscope that has been previously described5,39,45. Briefly, a femtosecond laser is used to generate 90 femtosecond pulsed laser light centered at 880 nm. Fluorescence light is detected with three of the four simultaneously acquiring detectors (Blue = 447/60, Green = 520/65, and Red 580/60; central wavelength/bandwidth) after separation from the excitation light by a dichroic (Chroma, Z720DCXXR). The microscope stand contains a 25x, 1.05 NA (numerical aperture) long working distance (2 mm) objective lens. It is important to note that, while we have used a custom-built microscope, the protocol described below can be accomplished on any commercially available multiphoton microscope as well.\n\t\nPlace a drop of distilled water between the 25x, 1.05 NA microscope objective and the window’s cover glass to make optical contact.\nUse the microscope eyepiece to focus on areas with fluorescent tumor cells near to the surface of the window.\nFind flowing blood vessels and labeled macrophages. It is critical to have flowing blood vessels to assess the dynamics of the vasculature.\nSwitch the microscope into multiphoton mode.\nSet the upper and lower limits of a z-series, which measures approximately 50 μm.\n\t\t\nSet the upper limit of the z-series by using the focus adjuster to move the objective to the desired start location, at the most superficial position, and marking this position as zero within the software by clicking on the Z position Top button.",
    "Set the lower limit of the z-series moving the objective to the deepest layer (typically 50-70 μm from the top for smaller tumors) and clicking the Z position Bottom button.\nSet the z-step size to 5 μm.\nClick the Time-Lapse panel button and set the time interval between acquisitions to at least 10 s to provide adequate time to replenish the water above the objective lens. This is done manually with a squeeze pipette on the objective during the long time lapse.\nRemove the syringe with PBS in the tail vein catheter and replace it with another syringe containing the 155 kDa dextran-TMR (tetramethyl rhodamine).\nInject 100 μL of 155 kDa dextran-TMR via the tail vein catheter.\nAfter injection, replace the TMR syringe with the PBS syringe.\nAcquire a z-stack time-lapse imaging by clicking on the Z-Stack and Time-Lapse buttons, then clicking on the record button.\nInject 50 µL of PBS every 30-45 min to maintain adequate hydration of the animal. Avoid injecting more than 200 μL at time as this can cause fluid overload.\nEuthanasia\nIncrease the isoflurane to 5% and keep the animal under 5% isoflurane with nose cone in place until 30 s after respirations cease.\nRemove the mouse from the stage.\nPerform cervical dislocation.\nImage processing\nLoad all images into ImageJ and format them into a 5 dimensional hyperstack (x, y, z, t, and color channel).\nPerform separation of spectral overlap (i.e.: GFP and CFP) and elimination of x-y drift from the hyperstacks using established methods38.\nUse the brightness and contrast adjustment to increase the white level of the blood channel so that the background signal becomes visible.",
    "For each z slice, carefully inspect each movie for signs of transient vascular leakage (a \"burst\"). Running the movies at fast frame rates (40 fps) may aid this identification.\nOnce a burst has been identified, return the brightness for this channel to a normal level and crop the hyperstack to this region and z-slice.\n2. Evaluation of extravascular dextran using fixed tissue analysis\nTumor and sample preparation\n\tNOTE: The 2nd part of this protocol assumes that breast tumors have been harvested from an orthotopic transplantation mouse model of breast carcinoma (i.e. the MMTV-PyMT). This model could be the same as the one described in the 1st part of the protocol, although fluorescently-labeled tumors are not necessary at this point.\n\t\nFollowing the termination of the experimental pipeline (i.e. drug treatments, etc.), perform a tail-vain injection of 100 μL of 10 mg/mL 155 kDa dextran-tetramethyl rhodamine, 1 h before sacrificing the mice.\nSacrifice the mice and harvest the breast tumors.\nFix tumors in 10% formalin for 48-72 h and proceed to paraffin-embedding.\nUsing a microtome, cut two 5 μm-thick sequential slides from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. One slide is used for staining the dextran, while the other will be used for performing TMEM triple-IHC, for reference.\n\t\tNOTE: The TMEM triple-immunohistochemistry protocol has been described elsewhere 10.\nIF staining and scanning for the first of the two sequential sections\nSubmit slides to a standard de-paraffinization protocol. This includes two subsequent immersions in xylene (10 min each), followed by dehydration in serially diluted alcohol solutions (100%, 95%, 70%, and 50% EtOH in H2O for 2 min each immersion).\nPerform antigen retrieval by heating (close to boiling point) the sections submerged in citrate (pH 6.0-adjusted) for 20 min.",
    "Let the samples cool to room temperature for 15-20 min and then wash in PBS 3x for 2 min each wash.\nBlock for 60-90 min in blocking buffer (10% FBS; 1% BSA; 0.0025% fish skin gelatin; 0.05% PBST, i.e. PBS with 0.05% Tween-20).\nIncubate samples with a mixture of primary rat and rabbit antibodies which target Endomucin and TMR, respectively, and then wash in PBST 3x, 2 min each.\nIncubate samples with a mixture of secondary donkey antibodies against rat IgG (conjugated to Alexa-647) and rabbit IgG (conjugated to Alexa-488), and then wash in PBST 3x 2 min each.\nPerform a routine DAPI staining (i.e. immersion in DAPI solution for 5-6 min), mount the slides using a glycerol-free \"hard\" mounting medium, and store in a dark place until scanning.\nFor optimal results, scan the slides on a digital whole slide scanner.\nImage Analysis\nCapture 10 High Power Fields (HPFs) per case, using any software suitable for digital pathology.\nSave the Endomucin (Red) and TMR (Green) channels separately as TIFF.\nUsing ImageJ, upload the TIFF files and convert them into 8-bit images.\nThreshold the 8-bit images to the level of the negative control, and generate two binarized images, showing the Endomucin and TMR \"masks\".\nFrom the Binary tools, select Fill Holes on the Endomucin mask.\nGenerate and save the following five regions of interest: 1) The thresholded dextran image as \"Dextran ROI\" (ROI1), 2) the thresholded endomucin image as \"Vascular ROI\" (ROI2), 3) the inverted endomucin image as \"Extravascular ROI\" (ROI3), 4) the intersected \"Extravascular ROI\" and \"Dextran ROI\" image (ROI1 ∩ ROI3) as \"Extravascular Dextran ROI\" (ROI4), and 5) the entire image as \"Tumor ROI\" (ROI5).",
    "Divide the ROI4 area by the ROI5 area and multiply by 100 to generate the percent area that the extravascular dextran covers in the entire tumor.\nRepeat the process for 10-20 HPFs per case (depending on tissue availability) and generate an average Extravascular Dextran (% area) for each case.\nSubscription Required.
