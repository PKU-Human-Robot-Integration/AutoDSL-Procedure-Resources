    "Preparation of M15 cells   5x106 M15 cells are plated to a 100 mm dish with 10 ml EF medium.   M15 cells are incubated in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.   When M15 cells are confluent (for 2-3 days), passage from a 100 mm dish to five 100 mm dishes.   M15 cells are washed by PBS.   M15 cells are trypsinized with 1 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min.   M15 cells are pelleted at 190 x g for 5 min.   M15 cells are plated to five 100 mm dishes.      When M15 cells are confluent, M15 cells are incubated with 10 μg/ml MMC containing EF medium in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 h to stop M15 cell from proliferation.   MMC-treated M15 cells are washed by PBS.   MMC-treated M15 cells are trypsinized with 1 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min.    M15 cells are pelleted at 190 x g for 5 min.   Resuspend and freeze MMC-treated M15 cells into cryovials with 22% FBS and 20% DMSO containing DMEM at 1 x 107 cells per tube at -150 °C.      Preparation of MEF   MEF (5x106) are plated to a 100 mm dish with 10 ml EF medium.   MEF are incubated in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.   When MEF are confluent (for 2-3 days), passage from a 100 mm dish to five 100 mm dishes.   MEF are washed by PBS.   MEF are trypsinized with 1 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min.   MEF are pelleted at 190 x g for 5 min.   MEF cells are plated to five 100 mm dishes.      When MEF cells are confluent, MEF are incubated with 10 μg/ml MMC containing EF medium in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 h.",
    "MEF are treated with MMC to stop M15 cell from proliferation.   MMC-treated MEF are washed by PBS.   MMC-treated MEF are trypsinized with 1 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min.    M15 cells are pelleted at 190 x g for 5 min.   Resuspend and freeze MMC-treated M15 cells into cryovials in 22% FBS and 20% DMSO containing DMEM at 2 x 106 cells per tube at -150 °C.      Maintenance of human ESCs   1 x 105 MMC-treated MEF cells are plated to a gelatin-coated 60 mm dish with EF medium. Note: Lower number of MEF cells is used compared to that of the mouse ESCs.    MMC-treated MEF cells are incubated in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight.   5x106 Human ESCs are plated on MEF-coated dish with hESC Medium in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C (day 0), until passage (4-7 days).    Medium is changed daily.       Intestinal differentiation of human ESCs   1 x 107 MMC-treated M15 cells are plated to two gelatin-coated 24 well plates in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight.   ESCs plated on MEF-coated dishes (step C3) are treated hESC Medium with 10 μM Y-27632, which is a ROCK inhibitor and is added to inhibit apoptosis, in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight (day 1).   ESCs are washed by PBS.   ESCs are trypsinized with 1 ml 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min.   ESC cells are pelleted at 190 x g for 5 min.   The supernatant is removed and 1 x 106 cells/ml resuspended in EB medium.    5 x 104 ESCs in 500 μl EB medium are plated to a M15-pre-coated well (day 0).   Medium is changed to hESCs Endoderm Medium at day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9.",
    "Note: Human ES cells-derived definitive endodermal induction is different with that of the mouse ESCs.    Medium is changed to 2 ml Intestinal Medium at day 10.   Medium is changed with 2 ml Intestinal Medium at every two days (Figure 1).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131219/20131219195714_1793.jpg Figure 1.
