Sequence the plasmids that contain inserts of the correct size \\(confirmed in step 118) using either sFvVP16F or sFvVP16R primers. Multiply the transformation efficiency from step 116 by the fraction of plasmids with insert determined from sequence data. This is equal to the size of library from 1 μl of ligation reaction in step 112.\n  120. Calculate the volume of ligation required to make a sub-library size of >1x106. Repeat the bacteria transformation with the remaining ligation reaction from step 112.",

Using the same bait line expressing LexA-antigen from step 36, screen the CDR2 sub-library using the procedure described in steps 37-65.\n  127. Plate all of the transformed yeast onto 5x large \\(25 cm × 25 cm) YC − WLH plates containing 25, 50, 75 or 100 mM 3-AT \\(this will allow iDAbs with increased in vivo binding affinity to be selected on the higher concentrations of 3-AT). \n  Pause Point: Yeast should be stable for at least 1 week at 4 °C. \n128. Incubate for 4–7 d at 30 °C. \n  129. Pick those yeast colonies that are 1–2 mm in size and separately streak onto a new 14- or 9-cm small round YC − WLH plate \\(as master plate). \n  130. Incubate the plates at 30 °C until yeast growth is visible \\(1–2 d). \n  Pause Point: The plates can be kept at 4 °C for 3–7 d.",
