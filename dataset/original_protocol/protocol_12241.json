    "Placentas were obtained immediately after spontaneous vaginal deliveries from uncomplicated pregnancies at the CHUM-St-Luc Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada, with informed patient consent and approval of ethical committees (CHUM-St-Luc Hospital and INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Laval, QC, Canada).\n1. Isolation and Purification of Villous Cytotrophoblast Cells\nSolutions and media\n\t\nPrepare transport media by supplementing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium High-Glucose (DMEM-HG) with 1% vol/vol antibiotic (10,000 units/ml penicillin G, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulphate) and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare primary culture media by supplementing DMEM-HG with 10% vol/vol fetal bovine serum (FBS), 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1% vol/vol antibiotic (10,000 units/ml penicillin G, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulphate) and store at 4 °C. Warm media to 37 °C before use.\nPrepare 4 L of saline solution (0.9% weight/vol sodium chloride).\nPrepare modified Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) by adding 25 mM HEPES to 1x HBSS (pH 7.4).\nPrepare fresh, four bottles of digestion solution with modified HBSS (prepared in 1.1.4), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), calcium chloride (CaCl2), trypsin, deoxyribonuclease IV (DNase IV), and 1% vol/vol antibiotic (10,000 units/ml penicillin G, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate) as shown in Table 1.\nPrepare density centrifugation media gradient\n\t\t\nPrepare density centrifugation media solution by supplementing density centrifugation media with 10% vol/vol HBSS 10x.\nPrepare 14 assay tubes with density centrifugation media solution and modified HBSS, as described in Table 2.\nMix each density solution (step 1.1.6.2) vigorously before adding its content to the gradient. Gently add the density solutions to a 50 ml glass centrifuge tube with a peristaltic pump (1 ml/min), beginning with the highest concentration (70%). Avoid droplets by draining the solutions against the tube wall to maintain the proper separation of each layer of the gradient.\n\t\t\t\nIn absence of a peristaltic pump, apply the layers very gently with Pasteur pipettes.",
    "Prepare final running buffer by supplementing the running buffer (see Table of Materials) with 2% vol/vol antibiotic/antimycotic (10,000 units/ml penicillin G, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate). Store at 4 °C.\nVillous cytotrophoblast isolation\n\tNote: Use sterile surgical equipment, glassware, pipettes, flasks, etc.\nOn the day of villous cytotrophoblast isolation, in a 37 °C water bath, warm the digestions solutions (from step 1.1.5) and 70 ml of FBS. Note: Use 50 ml of FBS to interrupt the digestions and the remaining 20 ml for the freezing step (1.2.22) which can be placed on ice once thawed.\nAfter delivery, bring the placenta to the laboratory in ice-cold transport medium (from step 1.1.1) as quickly as possible (less than 1 hr).\nDiscard transport medium and placental blood in liquid dustbin. Weigh the placenta and immerse in cold saline solution.\nMeasure and analyze the following features: umbilical cord length; umbilical cord localization; placental length, width, shape (oval, discoid); membrane color; cotyledon structure pathologies. Note: Data are presented in the results section.\nCut the umbilical cord alongside its placental insertion (i.e., at its base with an additional 1 cm radius circle around the cord). Immerse in 300 ml of histological tissue fixative solution (formalin 10%) for later histological analysis.\nCut the entire placenta into cubes of 5 x 5 x 5 cm. Wash thoroughly (4 times x ~ 1 min) in saline solution (0.9%) to remove blood cells until saline solution is clear. Discard rinsing liquid.\nIn a watch glass, remove placental membranes and mince tissues to remove blood vessels and calcifications. Hold blood vessels firmly with forceps and remove tissues using the back of Metzenbaum scissors.",
    "Place minced placenta in a Büchner funnel. Rinse with approximately 100 ml of saline buffer. Continue mincing until 30 - 35 g of minced tissue is obtained (use plastic weighing boat and scale). If needed, mince the remainder of the placenta to obtain up to three additional 30 - 35 g preparations. During this time, put minced tissue in a weighing boat on ice.\n\t\t\tNote: This step will take around 45 min to 1 hr.\nAdd the 30 - 35 g minced placental tissue to a trypsinizing flask. Transfer 150 ml of the prepared digestion solution 1 (Table 1) to the trypsinizing flask and mix well.\nPlace the trypsinizing flask in a shaking water bath for 30 min at a speed of no more than 50 cycles/min and manually mix the trypsinizing flask every 5 min for homogenous digestion.\nAt the end of the first digestion, remove the trypsinizing flask from the water bath and tilt it (45°) for 1 min to sediment the placental tissue. With a 10 ml sterile pipette, remove and discard approximately 80 ml of supernatant. Avoid aspirating the tissue.\nTransfer 100 ml of digestion solution 2 (Table 1) to the trypsinizing flask; mix well and repeat step 1.2.9.\nAt the end of the second digestion, remove the trypsinizing flask from the water bath and tilt it 45° for 1 min. With a 10 ml sterile pipette, remove 80 ml supernatant and gently transfer to a centrifuge tube with a cell strainer (100 µm mesh). Transfer the filtered supernatant to a beaker containing 2 ml of FBS every time the centrifuge tube is full.\nPerform the third digestion as described for the second digestion (1.2.11 and 1.2.12) using 75 ml digestion solution 3. In parallel, perform steps 1.2.15 to 1.2.16.1 for digestion 2.",
    "Perform the fourth digestion exactly as the third digestion using the digestion solution 4 (75 ml), but collect a maximum amount of supernatant. Perform steps 1.2.15 to 1.2.16.1 in parallel for digestion 3, and finally for digestion 4.\nAliquot the supernatant (from digestions 2, 3 and 4) into 13.5 ml parts, each part into one 15 ml centrifuge tube. With a 22.8 cm long glass Pasteur pipette, very gently and slowly place 1.5 ml of FBS at the bottom of each tube in order to create a separate layer. Do not mix FBS and supernatant. Centrifuge the tubes without brake for 20 min at 1,250 x g at room temperature.\n\t\tNote: After centrifugation, 4 layers are visible in the tube, as shown in Figure 1. The separation of trypsin and trophoblast cells avoids excessive cellular digestion.\nWith a vacuum pump, aspirate and discard the supernatant (digestion solution) and FBS layers, including the whitish film between the two layers. Resuspend the pellet (the trophoblasts and red blood cell layers) with 1 ml of warm cell culture medium (step 1.1.2; with no FBS and no HEPES).\n\t\t\nCollect resuspended cells from all tubes and combine them in 1 tube. Let the tube stand at room temperature until the end of all digestions. Note: After all digestions, the usual yield is 3 tubes of resuspended cells (one per digestion).\nMake up the volume to 15 ml with warm cell culture medium. Centrifuge at 1,250 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant with a vacuum pump. Avoid aspirating the pellet.\nGently resuspend the pellet obtained from the 3 tubes with 1 ml of warm cell culture medium. Pool their content in 1 tube. To obtain 8 ml, complete the volume with warm cell culture medium.",
    "Very gently layer the cell suspension on a separation gradient with a Pasteur pipette. Centrifuge without brake for 30 min at 507 x g at room temperature.\nAfter centrifugation, identify the different layers of cells in the gradient with back-lighting. Locate the layers containing trophoblast and contaminating cells between 40 - 50% of density centrifugation medium. With a vacuum pump, remove upper layers (> 50%).\nCollect cells located in the layers of interest with a Pasteur pipette and transfer them to a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Make up the volume to 50 ml with cell culture medium. Centrifuge for 10 min at 1,250 x g at room temperature.\nUnder sterile conditions, discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet with 20 ml of FBS and count the number of cells using a hemocytometer. On ice, add 2.22 ml of sterile dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and mix gently by flipping. Aliquot 1.5 ml of cell suspension into cryogenic vials, freeze overnight at -80 °C and transfer to a liquid nitrogen tank.\nTrophoblast purification\n\t\nInstall the rinsing and running buffers and a new filter column on the magnetic purification instrument according to manufacturer's instructions. Perform the \"clean program\" to clean negative 1, positive 1 and positive 2 ports, and then introduce the 50 ml tubes under each port according to manufacturer's instructions.\nThaw the cells that were frozen in step 1.2.22 quickly in a 37 °C water bath. Transfer cells to a 50 ml tube and resuspend cells gently with 20 ml of cold running buffer solution. Centrifuge the tube for 5 min at 450 x g and 4 °C.",
    "Discard the supernatant. Repeat the wash step with cold running buffer. Count cells using a hemocytometer to determine viability. Repeat the centrifugation (for 5 min, 450 x g at 4 °C). Carefully remove the supernatant. Add 1 ml of cold running buffer containing 1% vol/vol of mouse anti-HLA-ABC antibodies. Incubate at 4 °C for 30 min, mixing gently every 5 min.\nAdd 6 ml of cold running buffer. Centrifuge for 5 min at 450 x g and 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and repeat this step. Resuspend cells in 1 ml of cold running buffer containing 10% vol/vol of anti-mouse secondary antibody-coupled magnetic beads. Incubate at 4 °C for 15 min, mixing gently every 5 min.\nAdd 6 ml of cold running buffer. Centrifuge for 5 min at 450 x g and 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend in 5 ml cold running buffer.\nSeparate the trophoblast cells using the magnetic purification instrument. Collect cells at the negative port and add 20 ml of cold running buffer.\n\t\tNote: Trophoblast cells do not contain the complex HLA-ABC, and are thus separated from other cell types and directed towards the negative 1 port.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 450 x g and 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the cells in 20 ml warm primary culture medium. Count the cells using a hemocytometer to determine viability.\nPlate the cells at the following densities: 0.15 x 106 cells/well in 96-well plates, 1.6 x 106 cells/well in 24-well plates and 4.5 x 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. Incubate plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nConfirm the purity of the trophoblast cells by flow cytometry16,17 and/or by immunocytochemistry18.",
    "Note: The purity of the immunopurified cells was determined using FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against cytokeratin-7 and vimentin17-19. This protocol is well detailed in Lanoix et al., 20087.\nAfter at least 4 hr, rinse the cells twice with warm culture medium to remove unattached cells and then transfer the plates to the normoxia chamber, which is composed of 8% O2 (see Figure 2 and section 2).\n2. In Vitro Induction of Normoxia and Hypoxia/Reoxygenation\nIncubator chamber operation (see Figure 2A for set-up).\n\t\nIn a laminar flow hood, place a Petri dish containing sterile water at the bottom of the incubator chamber to avoid dryness; then place the previously prepared cell culture plates or flasks (step 1.3.10) on the superior shelves of the chamber.\nOutside the hood, attach the chamber (inlet port) to the gas hose (Figure 2A: 5a, b and c) to reach the tube of gas (8% O2 or 0.5% O2) (Figure 2A: 7). Open both inlet and outlet ports of the chamber. At this moment, the gas regulator (Figure 2A: 4) should remain closed.\nCarefully open the gas regulator valve (Figure 2A: 4). Flush for 4 min with an air flow of 25 L/min to completely replace the air inside the chamber.\nAfter flushing the chamber, close the gas regulator then the inlet and outlet ports of the chamber.\nUnplug the flow meter outlet hose (Figure 2A: 5c) from the inlet port of the chamber and place the chamber in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C.\nReplace the air currently present in the plates, flasks and dissolved in the culture medium by filling the chamber with gas 1 hr after step 2.1.3.\nRepeat steps 2.1.1 to 2.1.6 for the other gas compositions (e.g., 2% O2 for first trimester trophoblast culture9).\nConfirm the oxygen percentage (Figure 2B-C)",
    "To confirm the concentration of oxygen in the cell culture medium (without cells) inside the chamber, use an oxygen electrode connected to an oxygen adapter. Connect the oxygen electrode to a voltmeter.\nCreate a calibration curve in the same solution (i.e., cell culture medium) by exposing the solution to gases with known oxygen contents (e.g., 0% and 21% oxygen). After the readings are stabilized for each concentration, introduce the electrode into the medium in the chamber.\n\t\tNote: Take all measurement at the same depth in order to avoid any bias in oxygen concentration10.\nInduction of normoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation in trophoblasts.\n\t\nAfter adding primary trophoblast cells to the appropriate cell culture flasks, plates or Petri dishes, perform treatments as necessary.\nIn parallel, inside the chamber, expose cells to the desired gas mixture to reproduce a specific condition every 24 hr (Figure 3).\nSubscription Required.
