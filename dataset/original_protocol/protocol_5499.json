    "The preparation of partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) is depicted in Figure 1. All reagents are added using glass pipettes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171031/20171031235012_2632.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of the preparation of partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) from polysaccharides having galactose residue. (i) DMSO, NaOH-DMSO suspension, CH3I; (ii) TFA (2.5 M); (iii) 5% pyridine in 50% CH3CN/H2O, NaBH4 in 30% CH3OH containing 0.03 M NaOH; (iv) 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine in CH3CN, pyridine, acetic anhydride.Preparation of partially methylated sugarsDry tetrasaccharide (100 μg) in a screw-cap tube.Add 200 μl of dry DMSO and sonicate for 30 min.Add 200 μl of NaOH-DMSO (see Recipes) and vortex. Transfer the tube containing the sample onto ice and add 100 μl of iodomethane (CH3I). Sonicate for 5 min and vortex 3 times. Add 50 μl of CH3I again, and incubate for 30 min on ice.Add 1 ml of distilled water and then vortex. Add 1 ml of chloroform using a glass pipet (1 ml), vortex for 1 min, shake the tube well for 1 min, vortex for 1 min.Centrifuge sample at 900 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Remove water fraction (upper layer) using Pasteur pipette (aspiration).To wash organic layer containing the methylated carbohydrates, add 1 ml of water and shake the tube well for 1 min, then vortex for 30 sec. Centrifuge at 900 x g for 5 min at room temperature and remove the water fraction using Pasteur pipette (aspiration).Wash the organic layer two times using 1 ml of water.Evaporate organic fraction (lower layer) for 40 min at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen using a sample concentrator (Figure 2).Dissolve sample with 150 μl of 2.5 mol/L TFA. Fill with nitrogen gas and close tightly with a screw cap. Incubate at 100 °C for 4 h.",
    "Evaporate sample for 40 min at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen using a sample concentrator (Figure 2).Add 500 μl of 5% pyridine in 50% acetonitrile/water (see Recipes) to the dried, partially methylated sugars.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171031/20171031235348_1992.jpgFigure 2. Evaporation of sample at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen using sample concentrator (MD200-2). The spray nozzle was inserted into a glass tube which was placed to aluminum dry bath heating block. Sample was dried at 40 °C under nitrogen gas.Preparation of partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) from partially methylated sugarsAdd 200 μl of 5 mg/ml of NaBH4 solution (see Recipes) into the sample and incubate for 4 h at 37 °C.Add 200 μl of acetic acid and evaporate sample within 1 h at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen using a sample concentrator (Figure 2).Dissolve sample with 1 ml of 0.1% (v/v) MeOH-HCl and evaporate sample within 1 h at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen (Figure 2). Repeat this step four times.Add 150 μl of 5 mg/ml of 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine, 50 μl of pyridine and 150 μl of acetic anhydride, respectively, and incubate at room temperature for 4 h.After incubation, add 2 ml of distilled water.Add 2 ml of chloroform, vortex, centrifuge at 900 x g for 5 min at room temperature and remove water (upper layer).Add 2 ml of distilled water, vortex, centrifuge at 900 x g for 5 min and remove water (upper layer).Evaporate sample (organic layer) for 40 min at 40 °C under a stream of nitrogen (Figure 2).Dissolve sample with 30 μl of hexane.GC-MS (Agilent Technologies 7890A GC system) analysis of PMAAsSet electro impact ionization, 70 eV.Set carrier gas, helium at 1.2 ml/min.Set split less sample injection.",
    "Set column oven temperature program: 3 min at 100 °C, with an increase at 4 °C/min to 160 °C, 1 min at 160 °C followed by an increase at 0.5 °C/min to 180 °C, and a final increase at 20 °C/min to 260 °C and held for 10 min at 260 °C. Submit 1 μl of PMAAs in hexane to GC-MS."
