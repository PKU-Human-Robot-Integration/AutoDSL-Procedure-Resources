    "NOTE: The device, including the method of analysis, is covered by Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-169881 and the Japanese Patent No. 5708911. This study, including the protocol of the experiment with human subjects, was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Kanazawa University (#553-1).\n1. Prerequisites for the Perspiration Monitoring Device\nNOTE: Perform these steps only once before the first use.\nInstall the universal serial bus (USB)-serial port conversion interface drivers in the computer27. If the drivers are already installed, skip this step.\nConnect the USB-serial port conversion interface to the computer via USB cable. Wait for the automatic driver installation if any.\nSet the parameters of the conversion interface and check the ID number of the serial port as follows.\n\t\nOpen the device manager, and select [View] → [Devices by Type].\nLocate the \"Ports (COM & LPT)\" heading, and expand the section to find the heading containing \"CP210x USB to UART Bridge\" in the list.\nMemorize the ID number of the port (e.g., \"COM5\") in the \"CP210x USB to UART Bridge\" heading.\nDouble click the \"CP210x USB to UART Bridge,\" and open the \"Port Settings\" tab.\nSet the parameters as follows: \"Bits per second\" = 9600, \"Data bits\" = 8, \"Parity\" = \"None,\" \"Stop bits\" = 1, and \"Flow control\" = \"None.\"\nClick the \"OK\" button to close the window, and close the device manager.\n2. Setup of the Perspiration Monitoring Device\nNOTE: Set the recording settings as follows before using the device. Repeat these steps for each device if multiple devices are to be used.\nMake sure the battery is not inserted in the perspiration monitoring device.\nPlug the white connector of the USB-serial port conversion interface to the receptacle at the top of the perspiration monitoring device.",
    "Execute the perspiration recording software, followed by setting the device parameters as follows.\n\t\nOpen the \"Settings\" tab.\nSet the \"COM\" number to the ID number of the serial port (see step 1.3.3).\nClick the \"Confirm Connection\" button. Check if the message \"Connected…\" appears.\nAt the \"Data File Folder\" settings, choose the drive and select the folder where the perspiration data will be saved. To select the subfolder, double click the folder to open.\nSet the \"Number of holes\" to \"4.\"\nOpen the \"Measure & Rec\" tab, and set the \"Time Interval\" to the desired sample time.\nInsert a battery to the perspiration monitoring device.\nFill the device with dry silica gel (color should be blue or green if the color indicator is available), and close the lid. If the lid does not close completely, reduce the amount of silica gel.\nClick the \"Start Logging Now\" button in the perspiration recording software.\n\tNOTE: Because the perspiration recording starts just after the disconnection, the perspiration monitoring device may be left connected until the monitoring is to be started.\n3. Setup for the Measurement of Sympathetic Skin Response (SSR)\nNOTE: These steps are intended to monitor the sympathetic activities as the palmar SSR, and are not necessarily required for perspiration monitoring itself. SSR is a change of skin potential according to the sympathetic arousal stimulation such as upset and concentration28,29.\nCleanse the skin where the SSR is to be recorded with an alcohol swab.\nPut the anode, cathode, and grounding electrode on the palm, back of the hand, and wrist, respectively, by means of an electrode paste. Fix the electrodes with medical tape.",
    "Set the conditions of the instrumentation amplifier by turning the corresponding knobs of the amplifier as follows: Sensitivity = 1 mV/V, High cut filter (\"HI CUT\") = 3 kHz, and Low cut filter (\"LO CUT\") = 0.5 Hz.\nExecute the SSR recording software, and start the recording at a sampling rate of 200 Hz by clicking the \"Start Measurement\" button in the software.\n4. Recording of the Perspiration\nPut a medical double-sided tape on the bottom of the perspiration monitoring device. When putting a tape, make sure the measurement windows (i.e. four holes at the bottom of the device) are not obstructed.\nDisconnect the perspiration monitoring device from the USB-serial port conversion interface. Immediately after the disconnection, observe the perspiration monitoring begin automatically. Make sure the LED lamp is blinking.\nRemove the release liner of the medical double-sided tape, and put the perspiration monitoring device on the skin where perspiration is to be monitored.\nWait 10 min for stabilization of water vapor diffusion.\n\tNOTE: Although this process cannot be monitored, the previous study has confirmed that waiting 10 min is sufficient for stable monitoring26.\nStart the examination (e.g., sympathetic activity test).\nAfter the examination, remove the perspiration monitoring device from the skin. To stop the SSR recording, click the \"Stop Measurement\" button in the SSR recording software, and remove all electrodes from the skin.\n5. Perspiration Analysis\nConnect the perspiration monitoring device to the USB-serial port conversion interface (as in step 2.2).\nExecute the perspiration monitoring software.\nOpen the \"Settings\" tab, and click the \"Confirm Connection\" button.\nOpen the \"Measure & Rec\" tab, and click the \"Download\" button to save the raw data of the device in the specified folder (see step 2.3.4).\nPerform perspiration analysis as follows.",
    "Open the \"Analysis\" tab, and click the \"Read Data File.\" Observe the \"Open File\" dialog pop up. Select the saved file in the step 5.4, and then click the \"Open\" button.\n\t\tNOTE: The software automatically performs perspiration analysis based on the published method26, and the results will appear on the screen. At the same time, the perspiration data as the comma-separated values format will be saved in the same folder.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
