    "Begin operation with vessel setup. A conventional fermentor has the following components that need to be installed (Figure 1):\n\t\npH probe - for measurement of pH in the live culture. Calibrate probe before installation and sterilize with the vessel. Install probe in the headplate.\npO2 probe - for measurement of dissolved oxygen content inside the vessel during fermentation. Install in the headplate.\nHarvest pipe for sampling the culture. Install this adjustable height component in the headplate.\nGas sparger - resides at the bottom of the vessel and provides gas infusion to the culture. Hook sparger up to the gas source on the fermentor and mount in the headplate.\nImpeller shaft and impeller - the impeller stirs the culture and is critical for maintaining culture uniformity in the vessel.\nExhaust gas condenser - for curbing evaporative loss in the vessel by cooling the exhaust gas path.\nReagent pump lines for pH control or feed addition.\nClean the vessel and headplate with soap and water. A soft brush is recommended for scrubbing the vessel and headplate. Bleach or cleaners with chlorine cannot be used to clean the vessel.\nIf the media is not heat labile, add it to the clean vessel. Only add until maximum working volume is reached. In this instance, maximum working volume is 3.3 L for a 5 L total volume vessel.\nMount the vessel headplate, ensuring that the o-ring seal is properly seated.\nInstall the exhaust gas condenser.\nInstall the antifoam probe into its 10 mm port.\nInstall the harvest pipe into its 10 mm port. Put a piece of tubing on the top of it and clamp it off.\nInstall tubing and a 0.20 μm filter on the sparge inlet and then clamp this off.\nCalibrate the pH probe:",
    "Gather 2 reference buffers in small beakers, a wash bottle, and a spare wash beaker.\nHook the pH probe up to the fermentor and turn the fermentor on.\nScroll to the pH parameter and using the menu button, scroll to the 'Cal' option, and press 'Enter'.\nSelect '2' for 2 point calibration.\nWash off the probe tip and submerge in the low reference buffer. The value on the fermentor will stabilize. Using the + and - keys, adjust the displayed value to match the value of the pH reference buffer. Once it stops blinking, press 'Enter'.\nWash the probe off and insert it into the second reference buffer. Allow the value to stabilize and then use the keypad to make the displayed value match the high reference buffer value. Press 'Enter' to confirm.\nWash the probe tip off and disconnect it from the fermentor. Put the protective cap on the connection and install it in the headplate.\nOpen the pO2 probe tip and check to ensure that there is enough electrolyte to cover the tip. If not, add some to the reservoir and close it back up.\nInstall the pO2 probe in the headplate and make sure that the autoclave cap is put on to protect its electrical connections. It will be calibrated after sterilization.\nObtain a bottle for reagent feed with a dip tube and air filter. Add pump tubing to the dip tube port and attach the other end to the inlet port on the fermentor.\nPlace tubing on all unused ports then clamp tubing off.\nInstall a 0.45 μm filter on the exhaust gas condenser. This filter ensures that the vessel does not pressurize in the autoclave.",
    "Check that all tubes that go below the level of the media are clamped off to prevent media from coming out.\nPut the vessel in the autoclave for 25 - 30 min at 121 °C, liquid cycle. Caution: When it comes out it will be very hot.\nInstall the vessel on the fermentor base.\nHook up the pH probe cable.\nAttach the pO2 probe cable.\nHook the sparger up to the gas addition rotameter.\nSterilely add 1 M NaOH reagent to the bottle with the dip tube and install the pump head on the base pump head spindle.\nPut the temperature sensor in the thermowell on the headplate. Ensure that it goes all of the way to the bottom of the thermowell.\nLower the agitation arm onto the vessels impeller coupling.\nMake sure that the fermentor is on.\nCheck that water is available to the fermentor.\nTurn on the air supply to the fermentor.\nScroll to the temperature parameter and set the temperature to 37 °C. Press the 'Enter' button to start the temperature control. The vessel will heat up in 15 min or less.\nTurn the gas flow to 1 vessel volume of media per minute or less. For this set up, gas flow is 3 L/min. Bubbles should appear at the bottom.\nScroll to the agitation parameter and set to 300 rpm. Press 'Enter' to turn on the agitation.\nOnce the temperature has reached 37 °C, scroll to the pH parameter and set it to 6.8. Turn the pH control on by pressing the 'Enter' button.\nSet agitation to the maximum speed of 1,000 rpm for the run.",
    "Ensure that the pO2 probe is polarized properly to display proper values. After 2 hr, scroll to the pO2 parameter and use the 'Menu' button to select the 'Calibrate Function' and select the 1 point calibration.\nAfter 15 min, use the cursors to set the value to 100 and press 'Enter.' This will calibrate pO2.\nScroll to agitation and set to 300 rpm.\nUsing the 'Menu' button, turn the 'Cascade' to 'on' in the agitation menu. This will increase the speed of agitation in an effort to chop up air bubbles and force more oxygen into solution as growth demand increases.\nScroll to the pO2 parameter and set the value to 30. Press the 'Enter' button to start pO2.\nStart the control software package on the PC.\nOnce the probes are calibrated, agitation is stable at 300 rpm, temperature is at 37 °C and pH is close to 6.8, it is time to inoculate. Using alcohol, sterilize the port that will be used for inoculation.\nDraw the inoculum into a syringe and add it into the sterilized port. Close the port.\nMark the time of inoculation in a log book.\nIt is also important to take a sample at sterilization time. Sterilize the end of the harvest pipe tube with alcohol.\nOpen the clamp covering the harvest port and use a syringe to draw a sample. This first sample is usually discarded because it has been sitting in the pipe.\nUse another syringe to pull another sample.\nWith a third syringe, push air back through the pipe to remove as much dead volume from the line and clamp the line off.\nDetermine the cell density and pH and record the values. With microbial cultures, it is useful to log values every hour. Interval is culture dependent.",
    "Harvest methodology depends upon the intent for the culture after growth is completed. In this case, sample the culture a final time to receive endpoint values for cell density and possible pH or measurement of wet cell weight. Open the headplate disposed of the contents in a designated \"kill tank\" with bleach or other antimicrobial agents."
