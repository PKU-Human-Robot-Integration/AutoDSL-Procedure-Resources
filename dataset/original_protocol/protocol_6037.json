    "Construction of chamber and preparation of assay components (Figure 1)Dish for water deprivationPunch a hole in the Petri dish lidUse the lid of a 35 mm Petri dish to make the chamber for water deprivation of flies. Punch a 4 mm diameter hole through the side of each lid with an electric drill. Cover the Petri dish lid with nylon mesh (Figure 1A)Cut a circle of nylon net (100 mesh) slightly larger than the Petri dish lid. Spread 502 glue evenly round the edge of the lid, and then press the cover onto the nylon net with a heavy weight for at least 15 min.Clean the finished dishTo eliminate glue odors, wash the resulting experimental dish three times with distilled water and dry it in a ventilated space for at least five days before the experiment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128214756_4931.jpgFigure 1.

Dimensions of the experimental dish used for water deprivation.Construction of the dry chamber for water deprivation of flies (Figure 2)Make the dry boxPlace 600 g anhydrous CaCl2 into a plastic tray (220 x 160 x 60 mm, L x W x H).Cut the acrylic sheetCut a rectangle of acrylic sheet to cover the plastic tray containing CaCl2 (240 x 180 x 3 mm, L x W x H).Construct the dry chamberTransfer the covered plastic tray into a storage chamber (265 x 200 x 170 mm, L x W x H).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128214821_1446.jpgFigure 2. Drying chamber for water deprivation. Anhydrous calcium chloride (600 g) is contained in a covered plastic tray, which is kept in a storage chamber.",
    "Make the humidity plate (Figure 3)Drill holes in an acrylic sheetUse an acrylic sheet with a thickness of 2.5 mm to make the humidity plate. Cut the sheet into rectangular pieces 300 x 200 mm. Drill ten 9 mm holes through each sheet (ensure the distance between holes is at least 70 mm, as shown in Figure 3B).Attach caps of Eppendorf tubes to surround the holesRemove the caps from 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Apply 502 glue to these caps and press them onto the acrylic sheet to surround the holes, for 5 min. Leave the sheet overnight before the next step.Mark the positions of the experimental dishes on the humidity plateWhen the Eppendorf tube caps are tightly adhered to the acrylic sheet, draw a circle with a diameter of 40 mm using a marker pen with each hole as the center.Clean the humidity plateTo eliminate glue odor, wash the humidity plate with distilled water three times and dry in a ventilated place for at least five days before the experiment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128214836_3630.jpgFigure 3.

Diagram of one hole of the humidity plate with dimensions.Preparation of fliesFly Stocks Maintain flies at 25 °C and 60% RH under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. Use adult flies 4-7 days after eclosion for hygrotactic assays.Fly rearingTo maintain a suitable population density, transfer 20 females and 10 males of wild-type flies to a culture bottle (diameter 48 mm, height 100 mm) and allow females to lay eggs for two days; then discard the adult flies.Preparation of flies for behavioral testsCollect 20 male (or female) flies on a CO2 fly pad under a stereo microscope into a fresh food vial (diameter 32 mm, height 80 mm).",
    "Maintain the collected flies at 25 °C and 60% RH in the food vial under a 12:12 h light/dark cycle for two days before tests. Water deprivation (Figure 5)Transfer flies into a water deprivation dishGently move the 20 flies from their food vial into the tip of a 1 ml pipette with an attached suction tube (Figure 4), and then gently blow the flies into a water-deprivation dish through its side hole. Seal the hole with transparent tape.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128214858_3934.jpgFigure 4. Suction tube. Photograph of the top view of the suction tube for fly transfer from a culture tube into a water-deprivation dish.Transfer the experimental dishes into the dry chamberGently position the water-deprivation dishes loaded with flies onto the acrylic sheet in a dry chamber with the nylon net facing upward (Figure 5A).Place the dry chambers in an incubatorSeal the dry chambers by closing their lids. Transfer the dry chambers into an incubator at 25 °C and 60% RH (Figure 5B) for 8 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190128/20190128214916_2189.jpgFigure 5.

Photograph of dry chambers in an incubator.Observation of hygrotactic behavior in DrosophilaSet the testing environmentBefore the behavioral experiment, set the room temperature to 24 ± 1 °C and the humidity to 40-60% RH.Add water to the humidity platePlace the humidity plate on a horizontal surface. Add 200 μl distilled water to fill each cap on the plate and allow the plate to equilibrate at room temperature (24 ± 1 °C) for 30 min.Environmental acclimatization of flies After water deprivation, gently remove the experimental dishes with flies from the dry chamber.",
    "Allow the flies (still in their dishes) to acclimate to the experimental environment, including temperature (24 ± 1 °C), humidity (40-60% RH), and illuminance (we use an array of white LEDs as the light source, 800-850 Lux) for 15 min.Record water-seeking behavior (see Video 1)Turn on the video recorder and adjust the focus to the top surface of the humidity plate; then start recording. Gently place the experimental dishes on the humidity plate with the nylon net side facing downward. Align the experimental dishes with the centers of the water-containing caps, one by one. A video recorder monitors ten dishes on one humidity plate. Turn off the video recorder after the last dish has been placed on the humidity plate for 5 min. Note: The control group (flies without water deprivation) and experimental group (flies with water deprivation) should be placed on the same humidity plate. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Recording of water seeking flies. The left dish contains water-deprived flies. The right dish contains hydrated flies. The video is played at a speed of four times of normal.Cleaning experimental dishes and chambersThe dry chamber should be washed after use with distilled water and/or dilute ethanol solution (70%). The water-deprivation dish should only be washed with distilled water. We strongly recommend wearing gloves when handling deprivation dishes and chambers to prevent transfer of unwanted odors."
