Pay attention to the pH and osmolarity of solutions to avoid unnecessary cell death.\nFinal preparation of solutions. ∼25 min\nMeasure 180 mL of NMDG stock solution. Bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for > 10 min at 22°C.\nMeasure 90 mL of HEPES holding solution. Bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for > 10 min at 22°C.\npH the NMDG and HEPES solutions to 7.25 using HCl. Overshooting pH can be compensated with KOH (for NMDG) or NaOH (for HEPES holding). Avoid adding NaOH to NMDG solution to keep Na+ concentration low.\nAdjust osmolarity to 300 mOsm.\nMeasure the slightly overconcentrated solutions with an osmometer.\nReduce osmolarity by adding volumes of ddH2O. For NMDG; volume needed (mL) ∼= (Osm × 180/300 − 180) × 0.9 For HEPES; volume needed (mL) ∼= (Osm × 90/300 − 90) × 0.9\nTypically, this will bring the total volume to 200 mL of NMDG, and 100 mL of HEPES.\nPlace NMDG solution in −20°C or −80°C freezer until very cold (not frozen). This usually takes about 5–10 min.\nDissection and Sectioning ∼45 min\nSetup dissection tools and vibratome and water bath.\nBring water bath to 35°C.\nAssemble useful tools including: large scissors (for removing head), small scissors (for cutting skin and skull), blunt forceps, spatula, single edge razor blade; tray and Styrofoam lid for pinning and dissection; syringe for cardiac perfusion.\nPack vibratome outer-chamber with ice. Fill inner-chamber with 100 mL of the ice-cold NMDG solution. Bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.",
    "Place remaining 100 mL of ice-cold NMDG in slice holding chamber and keep on ice. Bubble with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Reserve a small amount (10 mL) for cardiac perfusion.\nAnesthetize the research animal according to institutional requirements. Vaporized isoflurane will anesthetize the mice and slow the breathing rate. Animals should be alive, but non-responsive to serious toe pinch. An inverted 15 mL centrifuge tube containing a tissue moistened with additional isoflurane placed over the animal’s snout will ensure a continued anesthetized state during cardiac perfusion procedure.\nAlternatives: Sodium pentobarbital is a common alternative anesthetic.\nPin animal, expose heart, puncture right atrium and perfuse ∼10 mL of ice-cold NMDG solution into left ventricle.\nQuickly remove head, open skull, and remove brain directly into the ice-cold NMDG. Let sit for about 1 min.\nRemove to a towel and bisect hemispheres. Block brain for semi-transverse sections (about 20 degrees from coronal and angled slightly off vertical, inward/downward) (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) with single edge razor blade.\nDab on towel and glue the cut cerebellar side to the vibratome plate. Insert plate into vibratome and orient the cortex toward the cutting blade to provide structural stability.\nSlice at 280 μm thickness, using speed ∼0.16–0.20 mm/s and amplitude of 1.6 mm. Slower sectioning while cutting through the hippocampus will preserve integrity of the hippocampal layers.\nGently collect sections containing hippocampus into the slice holder containing ice-cold NMDG using inverted/cut transfer pipette, or gentle paintbrush.\nWarming ∼10 min\nTransfer the NMDG containing slice holder with sections from the ice, into the 35 degree water bath.\nContinue bubbling in the water bath for 8–10 min. Do not over warm. It is recommended to shield from light to preserve fluorescence.\nRecovery ∼1.5 h\nRemove holder from water bath.",
    "Carefully discard the NMDG solution and replace with room-temperature (at 22°C), bubbled HEPES holding solution. Slices may either remain in the slice holding chamber during solution change or may be carefully transferred to a second container with HEPES. Ensure that sections are submerged and loosely separated. Continue bubbling at 22°C for 1–1.5 h. Take care that bubbling is not so vigorous as to cause turbulence/tumbling of the sections. Continue shielding from light with sheets of aluminum foil.\nCritical: All materials and equipment involved in the preparation of acute brain slices must not have come in contact with fixative (paraformaldehyde or equivalent). Reserve glassware, dissection tools, and vibratome for “live-tissue only.” Do not share equipment with lab-mates that use fixative or other harsh chemicals, as it will seriously compromise your tissue. It is recommended not to use detergents or use department dishwashers. Thorough rinsing in water and scrubbing with reserved glassware brush will suffice. Brief application of 70% ethanol may be used to keep bacteria from growing on tools or slice chambers.\nPatch recording\nTiming: 4–7 h\nThe bioelectric state of the cellular membrane has been shown to control cell behavior and proliferation in many cell types through regulation of ion channels or pumps in the plasma membrane (Aprea and Calegari, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Levin, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Cells undergoing division events require depolarization for the division process and will otherwise remain hyperpolarized during the non-division parts of the cell cycle. In Nestin-GFP+ rNSCs, electrophysiological patch recordings during chemogenetic stimulation allows monitoring of the membrane potential (Vm) as a readout of the stem cell activation state. This section assumes readers have some general knowledge of the patch-clamp technique and will therefore highlight specificities for recording rNSCs.\nFinal preparation of 1× ACSF recording solution\nCombine in ddH2O.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_468_6.csv",
    "Bubble for at least 10 min at 22°C with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\npH to 7.24.\nAdjust osmolarity to ∼305 mOsm.\nIdentify cells for recording.\nPlace a single slice in upright microscope recording chamber (actively perfused with bubbled ACSF). Secure with a slice anchor.\nLocate dentate gyrus and confirm presence of GFP+ rNSCs and mCherry+ virally targeted CCK neurons containing DREADD construct. See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nUsing a 40× water dipping objective, identify the small GFP+ cells that contain radial processes that extend into the granule cell layer. Avoid enlarged and overtly rounded cells which may be proliferating progenitor cells, rather than rNSCs. Cells closest to the interface of hilus and granule cell layer are best.\nAvoid cells directly on the surface of the slice, which may be damaged or cut.\nSwitching back and forth from fluorescence to DIC imaging modalities will help locate the soma of a rNSC that can be patched.\nPatch a rNSC. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/468-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sample recordings from rNSC during chemogenetic stimulation of virally targeted CCK interneurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus\n(A) Differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescent images from live tissue during targeted recording of a GFP+ rNSC in a CCK-Cre::Nestin-GFP animal. Scale bar, 50 μm.\n(B and C) Representative whole-cell recordings of membrane potential in rNSCs when CCK cells are activated by bath application of 10 μM CNO. Depolarization begins within approximately 10 min of CNO addition and reaches steady state in about 30 min. Depolarizations are blocked in the presence of CCK2 receptor antagonist, YM022.

(2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3].\nPull 1.5 mm capillary glass to 4.5–6.5 Mohm resistance when filled with the K-gluconate based internal recording solution.",
    "Note: The rNSCs are small, and therefore the user will need to pull microelectrode tips slightly smaller than typically used for neuronal recordings.\nApproach cells under DIC illumination with moderate positive electrode pressure to pass through the granule cell layer, and then reduce to weak positive pressure when in proximity to the cell of interest. rNSCs do not always form an obvious dimple in the membrane as a neuron might, but they are somewhat hardy, and will withstand slight touches from the pipette tip itself. Cells that shift entirely when nudged are probably dead and have overly hardened membranes or shriveled appearance.\nZero the offset, apply very weak suction for 2–4 s while adjusting the holding potential in order to form a seal. Gohm seals should form quickly in most circumstances. Do not over suction, as the cellular material is very limited.\nSet holding potential to -75 mV.\nUse slight but quick suction in conjunction with the zap function (1 V pulse) to break in. Use the smallest duration zap possible (typically around 0.5 ms), and progressively increase it until break in has been accomplished. rNSCs have very little capacitance, and low resistance, and therefore look very square upon break in. Whole-cell parameters typically obtained by a square voltage deflection (for example, using “cell” mode in the seal-test window of pClamp) will not able to provide capacitance and time constant measurements.\nSwitch to I=0 mode and monitor resting membrane potential. An average of 10 runs of a 200 ms sweep will suffice. Vm should be between -70 and -90 mV.",
    "Change to voltage-clamp mode and apply a series of holding pulses (100 ms pulse starting from -95 mV and increasing at 5 mV steps) to monitor current responses. They should be large and very linear. No sodium currents typical of immature action potentials should be present.\nChange to current clamp mode, and apply a series of current pulses (100 ms pulse starting at -30 pA and increasing by 5 pA steps) to monitor voltage responses. These should be small and no rectifying voltage deflection at higher current steps should be visible.\nRecord membrane potential. See Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C.\nRemain in current clamp mode with no applied current (Ih = 0).\nUse the following protocol to record 10 min of baseline Vm. Breaking the 10-min recording into 30-s sweeps followed by brief test pulses allows for periodic monitoring of the seal integrity during recording.\nUse current clamp mode with the holding current set to 0 pA.\nEnable comments in the data file, and use them to keep track of experimental conditions, such as when CNO or other pharmacology has been added.\nRecord 20 sweeps of 31.2 s long (totaling slightly longer than 10 min).\nOf the 31.2 s sweep, 30 s will be allocated to data recording, and the remainder will be used for a small current pulse to monitor seal integrity.\nApply a -100 pA, 100 ms monitoring pulse at time = 30.01 s.\nSudden changes in the response to this monitoring pulse during the experiment may indicate seal failure.\nTypical experimental paradigms will include 1 run (10 min) of stable baseline recording, followed by several 10-min runs in the presence of chemogenetic stimulation by introducing 10 μM CNO into the bath perfusate.\nSlices should be changed between recordings to avoid residual effects of previous pharmacology applications.",
    "Optional: Include various pharmacological agents such as glutamate receptor antagonists in the bath starting at baseline conditions to help determine mechanisms of action on the rNSCs. For examples, see (Asrican et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: Membrane responses in rNSCs are slow, and may take up to 30 min to develop, and typically are on the order of several tens of millivolts. For example, rNSCs may depolarize from -80 mV to -20 mV when CCK interneurons are activated chemogenetically. See Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C. Depolarizations should be smooth and not abrupt.\nCritical: Electrode position must be constantly monitored via camera to avoid loss of the rNSC during the recording due to drift. Small microelectrode position adjustments are typically needed throughout the recording. As these cells are small, they are less tolerant than neurons to positional drift of the patch pipette."
