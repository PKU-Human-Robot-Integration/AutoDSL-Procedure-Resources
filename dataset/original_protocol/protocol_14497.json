    "All materials and equipment need to be gathered and adequately organized prior to procedure. The procedure is to be conducted with seamless transitions from one step to the next in order to provide consistent, reproducible data. This protocol follows institutional policies set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Buffalo Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\nNOTE: Both male and female C57BL/6 mice were used for this protocol. There is no significant difference of albumin leakage between sexes.\n1. Hydrochloric Acid Preparation\nMake 56.2 mM HClsterile by adding 281 µL of 1 N HCl to 4.72 mL sterile normal saline (SNS). Titrate to pH 1.25 with 1 N HCl (≈ 0 - 50 µL).\nMake this preparation fresh prior to injury. As low pH SNS is not buffered it ensures the hydrochloric acid injury insult is transient.\n2. Anesthesia and Tracheal Exposure Technique\nNOTE: Ensure that the injury procedure is conducted in a fume hood with charcoal filtering for anesthetic gas scavenging. Maintenance of sterile conditions is essential as this is a survival surgery. Use sterile gloves and sterilize all instruments in a glass bead surgical instrument sterilizer prior to surgery on each animal. The use of drapes to isolate the surgical site is recommended to maintain sterility. Use isoflurane as the anesthetic gas as it provides a relatively low blood gas solubility allowing rapid induction of anesthesia, as well as rapid recovery following the injury.\nStart by inducing anesthesia in a chamber with 2.75% isoflurane in oxygen with flow rate of 2 L/min.",
    "Once the mouse is adequately anesthetized (unresponsive to toe pinch strong enough to not break skin or cause deep tissue damage), suspend the mouse by the superior incisors with a 15 cm length of 1-0 braided silk suture in a supine position on a 60o incline dissection board.\nEnsure that anesthesia is maintained throughout surgery by delivering isoflurane through a nose cone. Apply veterinary ointment on mouse's eye to prevent dryness.\nShave the ventral portion of the neck with an electric trimmer and apply topical antiseptic solution (i.e., povidone-iodine). Remove excess antiseptic with gauze and let dry (~15 - 30 s).\nInfiltrate the midline of the neck from the sternal notch to inferior part of jaw with 100 µL 0.5% bupivacaine (to provide pre-, peri-, and post-operative analgesia).\nMake a 1 - 1.5 cm longitudinal midline incision in the neck with a scalpel or curved fine scissors. Penetrate the fascial membrane between the salivary glands by blunt dissection with 2 curved serrated forceps to expose the trachea (identified by the white cartilage rings).\nStill using the 2 serrated forceps, grasp one side of the paratracheal musculature and pull it to the side while dissecting between the muscle fibers longitudinally next to the trachea.\nOnce dissection plane is established, continue retracting the paratracheal muscle as the second pair of forceps is worked under the trachea. Use these forceps to place a 15 cm strand of 1-0 braided silk suture into the tip of the forceps and pull through to place the suture behind the trachea.\n3. Intra-tracheal Instillation Procedure",
    "Prepare the injury instillation syringe by filling a 0.5 mL syringe attached to a 22 G needle with 0.2 mL of air followed by 3.6 mL/kg of hydrochloric acid. The air will act to aid in dispersion of the vehicle, as well as an alveolar recruitment maneuver for those alveoli that may have undergone atelectasis during anesthesia administration.  \n\tNOTE: Follow local IACUC guidelines regarding post-operative analgesia and consult with your local veterinarian. Be careful about using any analgesics with anti-inflammatory properties before employing this model of sterile lung injury.\nTo administer the injury, first discontinue isoflurane administration. Allow mouse's anesthetic depth to rise for about 10 - 15 s until it begins to react to a forceps toe pinch.\nImmediately begin instillation steps of injury. If anesthetic depth is too deep the animal will not breathe spontaneously after injury instillation, which is especially true for hydrochloric acid containing injuries.\nHave an assistant squeeze the ribcage to expel vital capacity.\nUse the 1-0 braided silk suture placed previously around the trachea to provide traction by pulling it superiorly and then insert syringe needle into trachea between the 1st and 2nd cartilaginous rings below the larynx. The needle bevel should face the surgeon and advance until the bevel is just past the trachea with the needle as parallel with the trachea as possible.\nRelease the chest just before bolus administration of hydrochloric acid in order to assure dispersion and deposition into the distal airway and alveoli. Deposit the bolus in roughly 0.5 - 0.75 s. Keep the needle in the trachea until the first spontaneous breath is taken to ensure that the entire injury bolus volume is inhaled into the lungs.\nClose incision using either 1 - 2 skin staples or sutures.\n4. Recovery",
    "Using a 5 mL syringe with a 26 G needle, inject 1 mL SNS subcutaneously into scruff of neck for fluid resuscitation. Although there is minimal fluid loss during procedure, following surgery the mouse tends to not drink and can potentially dehydrate. Alternatively, provide SNS via an intraperitoneal injection.\nPlace mouse in heated chamber at 37 °C perfused with 100% O2. Ensure that the mouse is adequately recovered before being placed back into housing. Monitor animals and do not leave unattended during this time until ambulatory and fully recovered.\n5. Bronchoalveolar Lavage and Lung Processing\nInduce and maintain isoflurane anesthesia as described in Step 2.1 and Step 2.2. Confirm adequate plane of anesthesia using toe pinch method described in Step 2.2.\nSecure in a supine position on a dissecting board and use a loop of 1-0 braided silk suture hooked onto the superior incisors to extend the neck. Apply veterinary ointment on eyes to prevent dryness.\nAfter removing the neck skin staples, make a midline longitudinal incision through the skin from the lower abdominal wall through the previous neck incision to the mandible with scissors.\nMake a midline incision in the peritoneal musculature with scissors and retract the abdominal organs with sponges to expose the retroperitoneal space. If blood is needed, collect from the abdominal aorta or inferior vena cava at this point.\nEuthanize the animal via exsanguination by transecting the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava. By utilizing a bilateral thoracotomy in the following step a secondary confirmatory method of euthanasia will be completed humanely as established by IACUC guidelines.",
    "Perforate the diaphragm to cause lung collapse. Then using bone cutting scissors, cut away the diaphragm and cut through the rib cage parallel to and on both sides of the sternum. Use a locking hemostat to retract the sternal flap to facilitate injecting 5 mL warm (37 °C) Hank's Balanced Salt Solution with calcium and magnesium into the right ventricle to flush the lung vasculature.\n\t\nAs the blood from the aorta is obtained to evaluate peripheral cytokine levels prior to the procedure described in this paper, make a small incision in the left ventricle to provide necessary outflow for blood to leave the circulation to adequate flush the lung vasculature if not obtaining blood.\nProp the dissection board to a 60° incline and use the procedure described in Step 2.2 to facilitate inserting a 20 G x ½\" stainless steel cannula in the trachea and secure with a 1-0 suture.\nPlace the dissection board horizontally and perform a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).\nTo perform the BAL attach two 5 mL syringes to a 3-way stopcock. Fill one syringe with 5 mL of SNS and screw into port of stopcock. Attach an empty 5 mL syringe to a 2nd port and finally attach open port of stopcock to intra-tracheal cannula placed in Step 5.6. Instill 1 mL of NS into lungs and lavage with second syringe.\nRepeat for 5 total 1 mL NS instillations being careful that the tracheal cannula remains secured and parallel to the trachea so it does not tear the trachea.\nFor histological analysis, cannulate the trachea as in Step 5.7. Fix the lungs by insufflating with 10% neutral buffered formalin at 20 cm H2O for 24 h.",
    "Remove each lung lobe carefully using scissors and forceps by transecting bronchus near the hilum. Place each lung lobe (5 total) in a histology cassette prior to being embedded in paraffin. Cut 5 µm tissue sections with a microtome, and stain with hematoxylin and eosin using standard histological techniques.6 Morphometrics can also be performed on the histological slides to quantify the severity inflammation.4\nProcess the recovered BAL by centrifuging at 1,500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Aliquot the cell-free BAL supernatants in equivalent amounts into 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes for future analysis. Store at -80 °C.\nAnalyze the BAL for albumin concentration by ELISA, or any other biological product of interest.11The pelleted cells from the BAL can be counted, cytoslide specimens generated, and stained with Wright-Giemsa-based stain for white blood cell differential count determination to assess the lungs' inflammatory reaction.\nSubscription Required.
