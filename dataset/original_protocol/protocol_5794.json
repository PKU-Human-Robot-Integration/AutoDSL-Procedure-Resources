    "Biofilm formation and treatment (Figure 1)Streak out S. aureus strain (IPLA1) from the frozen stock onto a TSB agar plate and incubate statically overnight at 37 °C.To obtain three biological replicates, pick 3 isolated colonies of S. aureus from the agar plate with a sterile plastic loop and inoculate into three 10-ml polystyrene tubes containing 2 ml of TSB medium.Grow bacterial cultures overnight at 37 °C, with shaking at 250 rpm.Dilute the overnight cultures to an OD600 of 0.1 in TSBG medium (TSB supplemented with glucose), containing approximately 107 CFU/ml, and then make a 1:20 dilution in the same medium to prepare the inoculum for the biofilm assays.Inoculate 2 ml from this cell suspension (approximately 5 x 105 CFU/ml) into each well of a 12-well microtiter plate (four wells per biological replicate).Incubate the microtiter plate in static for 24 h at 25 °C.Note: In this case, the temperature used for biofilm formation and treatment was 25 °C, which represents treatment/disinfection at “room temperature”. Nonetheless, the experiment could have also been performed at different temperatures; for instance, at 37 °C to represent treatment of human infection.Remove the planktonic phase from the wells and wash the biofilms twice each with 2 ml of PBS.For each replicate, add 1 ml of NaPi buffer alone to two wells and 1 ml of NaPi containing 10.94 μg/ml (0.18 μM) of LysH5 to the other two wells. Incubate in static for 30 min at 25 °C.Remove supernatant.Wash twice with PBS.Harvest cells corresponding to the same biological replicate and treatment in 1 ml of RNA protect® and 500 μl PBS by scraping with a pipette tip and transfer to a clean Eppendorf tube.Process the samples according to the RNA protect® manufacturer’s instructions.Store at -80 °C or proceed to RNA purification.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180614/20180614031459_5022.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of the protocol.",
    "The different steps of this method include biofilm formation and treatment (purple), subsequent RNA purification and RNA-sequencing (pink) and, finally, computer analysis of the generated data (light green).RNA purification and sequencing (Figure 1)To achieve cell lysis, perform mechanical disruption of the cells with glass beads and phenol using FastPrep equipment.After lysis, samples were centrifuged at 9,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer the upper phase to a clean tube and add 500 μl chloroform and then centrifuge for 5 min at 9,000 x g and 4 °C.Transfer the upper phase to a clean tube and mix with 250 μl of ethanol by pipetting.Transfer the samples mixed with ethanol to the columns provided with the illustraTM RNAspin Mini kit and perform the rest of RNA purification steps following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.Elute in 50 μl of nuclease-free water and add 1 μl of SUPERase-InTM.Add 5 μl of Turbo DNase buffer and 1 μl of Turbo DNase per 50 μl sample and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Add 1 μl of Turbo DNase per sample and incubate for another 30 min at 37 °C.Remove DNase from sample with inactivation reagent as indicated by the manufacturer.Add 1 μl of SUPERase inhibitor per 50 μl sample.Check RNA quality and concentration by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) in TAE buffer and the Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (Figure 2). RNA concentrations obtained with this protocol usually range between 200 and 700 ng/μl.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180614/20180614031813_9928.jpgFigure 2. Agarose gel electrophoresis of total RNA from S. aureus biofilm samples. Aliquots (1-2 μl) from different RNA samples were run in a 1% agarose gel. Two bands corresponding to the 23S and 16S rRNAs should be visible and preferably in a proportion of 2:1 (23S:16S) indicating RNA integrity.",
    "Sometimes a lower band corresponding to 5S rRNA can also be observed.Samples with A260/A280 ratios ≥ 1.8 can be considered adequate for RNA-seq analysis. Otherwise, clean up the samples with the illustraTM RNAspin Mini kit following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer.Take 8 μg of RNA from each sample and proceed with sequencing steps according to the protocols recommended by the manufacturer of the selected platform. For example, in this study samples were sent to an external service provider (Macrogen Inc., South Korea) for sequencing with an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform according to the protocols recommended by Illumina, generating 100-bp paired-end reads.Computer analysis of the generated data (Figure 1)Check the quality of the reads in FASTQ format with FastQC.Download the reference genome in FASTA format (.fa or .fna), the protein table file (.ptt) and the RNA table (.rnt) from the NCBI archive (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/archive/old_genbank/Bacteria/[href=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/archive/old_genbank/Bacteria/]). Run script “edge.pl” with arguments indicating the FASTQ files containing paired-end reads for each sample (-u and –v) as well as the three files mentioned above (-g, -p and –r) and the prefix for the output files names (-o). In a first step, EDGE-Pro will map the reads to the reference genome using program BowTie2 and create an alignment file as output (this file will be in sequence alignment map or SAM format). BowTie2 also indicates the percentage of alignment to the reference genome. Once completed this step, EDGE-Pro performs transcript quantification into Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKMs). The output files containing the RPKM counts will end in “.rpkm_0”.Example: /edge.pl -g SAreference.fna -p SAreference.ptt -r SAreference.rnt -u Lys_1-1.fastq -o Lys1 -v Lys_1-2.fastqRun script “edgeToDeseq.perl” indicating the .rpkm_0 files to be analyzed in order to generate a table gathering the raw counts for each gene and each sample.",
    "This table will be saved in the output “deseqFile”.Example: /edgeToDeseq.perl NaPi1.rpkm_0 NaPi2.rpkm_0 NaPi3.rpkm_0 Lys1.rpkm_0 Lys2.rpkm_0 Lys3.rpkm_0 Note: This step is necessary because DESeq2 requires information on raw counts and not RPKMs.Perform differential expression analysis between treated and untreated samples with DESeq2 by using the “deseqFile” from the previous step as an input. Select genes with an adjusted P-value < 0.05 for further analysis and save the table of differentially-expressed genes in .csv format.Confirmation of RNA-seq results by RT-qPCR (Figure 1)Convert 0.5 μg RNA from each sample into cDNA with iScriptTM Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR as indicated by the manufacturer.Dilute cDNA samples 1:25 in nuclease-free water and use them as a template for qPCR.To perform qPCR, add 2.5 μl aliquots from the different samples to each well of a MicroAmp® Fast optical 96-well reaction plate together with 3.25 μl of nuclease-free water, 0.25 μl of each primer from a 10 μM stock, and 6.25 μl of Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix.Analyze each biological replicate in duplicate.Determine changes in gene expression by using a reference gene (in this case rplD) according to the 2-ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001), in which ΔCT = CT(target gene) - CT(reference gene) and ΔΔCT = ΔCT(target sample) - ΔCT(reference sample)."
