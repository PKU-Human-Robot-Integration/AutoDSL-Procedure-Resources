    "1. The Measurement of Suppression\nBefore beginning the measurement of suppression, give the patient detailed instructions (see 1.8) and show the visual stimuli relating to steps 1.2-1.8 below on the laptop screen. All patients should wear full refractive correction (glasses/contact lenses) throughout the procedure, suitably adjusted for the working distance.\nThe goggles (eMagin 8700) should be fitted to the patient (over the top of spectacles/contact lenses) and properly adjusted. Ensure that the screens sit parallel to the ocular surface. The screens can be adjusted to account for each patient's interpupillary distance. Instructions for connecting and calibrating the goggles can be found here: http://www.3dvisor.com/wpcontent/uploads/2010/08/UserGuide10.7.pdf[href=http://www.3dvisor.com/wpcontent/uploads/2010/08/UserGuide10.7.pdf].\nThe stimuli consist of two populations of moving dots, one population moving in a common direction (the 'signal' dots) and the other moving in random directions (the 'noise' dots). The observer's task is to report the signal direction. Task difficulty is manipulated by varying the relative proportion of signal to noise dots in the stimulus.\nThe custom Matlab programs which control these measurements utilize a 3-down 1-up staircase procedure. There are two separate measurement stages. The first provides a binocular threshold, that is, the threshold number of signal dots required when both signal and noise dots are presented to both eyes at high contrast. The second program measures the contrast imbalance required to achieve the same threshold when the dot populations are presented to separate eyes.\nDifferent images are displayed on the goggles screens through the use of a Matrox DualHead2Go, (Montreal, Canada) device.\nTo begin the suppression assessment, first measure a binocular threshold. Here the same visual stimuli are shown to both eyes and the minimum number of signal dots required to accurately judge the direction of the dot movement is measured.",
    "To align the eyes, the screens will display a black half cross in each eye against a white screen. Using the keyboard, the patient is asked to move the half of the cross seen by the amblyopic eye until it lines up with the half seen by the fellow eye. It is important that the patient is advised that the image seen by the amblyopic eye may be blurry, but it is the alignment that is important. If the moving image disappears from view ask the patient to blink more frequently as this may improve the visibility of the image. Exact ocular alignment (pixel values) can be extracted following each measurement to ascertain the repeatability of this task.\nOnce the patient reports that the half crosses are aligned, the measurement procedure can begin. Each measurement takes about three minutes to complete. Five short staircase measurements are completed for each of the two parts of the measurement. The following instructions should be given before the measurement begins:\nInstructions for the observer:\n\t\"During this test you will be asked to make a judgment about the direction of moving images.\"\n\t\"You will see a group of white/grey dots against a grey background. After each presentation I will ask you to decide if the dots are mostly moving to the left or right using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard in front of you.\"\n\t\"There are two groups of dots, some move smoothly to the left or right (the signal dots), the other group appear to move in random directions.\"",
    "\"Please try to decide which direction the signal dots are moving in (right or left) amongst the confusion of the random dots.\" \"As you continue to make decisions the number of random dots will increase, making it more difficult to see the signal dots, when it gets so difficult you cannot tell the direction, please just take your best guess\".\nThe first measurement can now start. A good 'last minute' instruction is to remind the participant to blink regularly (\"a good time to blink is when you press the button\").\nFive measurements using the binocular staircase paradigm are now made. Ocular alignment is repeated before each measurement is started.\nThe result obtained from each measurement is the threshold number of signal dots (out of 100 dots total) required to correctly judge the direction when both eyes see the same stimuli. The program also reports the range of responses as a standard error of the measurement.\nFor the next measurement, the contrast staircase, the five results from the binocular staircases are averaged and the resulting threshold defines the number of signal dots presented to the amblyopic eye. The remaining noise dots are presented to the non-amblyopic eye at varying contrasts to assess suppression.",
    "For this measurement the amblyopic eye always sees high contrast dots whereas the contrast of the noise dots shown to the non-amblyopic eye is varied using a staircase procedure. At the start of the staircase a fixed number of signal dots (obtained from step 1.11) are shown to the amblyopic eye at 100% contrast and the remaining number of noise dots are shown to the fellow eye at 0% contrast (i.e. no noise dots are visible resulting in minimal suppression). Correct identification of the signal dot direction results in an increase in the contrast of the noise dots shown to the fellow eye according to the 3-down 1-up staircase algorithm. Throughout the measurement, the contrast of the noise dots shown to the fellow eye is varied by the staircase until task performance converges on 79% correct. This indicates that the signal and noise dots are being combined between the two eyes to produce the same level of task performance that was observed under binocular viewing conditions (step 1.11). The ratio of the contrast of the signal dots presented to the amblyopic eye (always 100%) relative to the contrast of the noise dots shown to the fellow eye at threshold is a measure of the balance point. Increasing the contrast of the noise dots shown to the fellow eye above this point would result in suppression of the signal dots shown to the amblyopic eye and impairment in task performance.\nFive measurements are made of the contrast imbalance and an average result is calculated. The result informs the examiner about the level of contrast imbalance that is necessary to overcome suppression and allow the amblyopic eye and fellow eye to see the dots simultaneously.\n2. Training Using this Method",
    "The contrast imbalance found in step 1.14 above can be used as a starting point for a training regime. The training involves integrating the use of dichoptic images with the contrast imbalance into a video game format (\"tetris\"). The video game can be implemented on either the virtual reality goggles or on an ipod touch device.\nThe video game tetris involves a series of falling blocks which are fitted together to form complete lines. The amblyopic eye sees full contrast blocks, and the fellow eye sees reduced contrast images. Information presented to each eye must be perceived simultaneously for successful play.\nOver time as the training regime continues the contrast imbalance is reduced by increasing the contrast to the fellow eye, making it more difficult for the visual system to overcome the suppression caused by more similar dichoptic images.\nTraining duration should be 1-2 hr a day and should be continued until no further improvement in contrast imbalance (increase in contrast presented to the fellow eye) is observed. During the training regime, checks of monocular and binocular function should be made regularly (determined by age of patient and underlying condition). Tests of monocular visual acuity, stereopsis and standard tests of suppression are particularly important for reporting progress."
