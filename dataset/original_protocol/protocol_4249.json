    "Plate 1.5 x 107 293T cells in a T175-cm2 tissue culture flask with 20 ml of DMEM culture media and culture overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Prepare 1.75 ml of H2O containing 60 μg of TN6-GFP proviral DNA, 20 μg of pCMV-BlaM-Vpr, and 10 μg of pAdVAntage vectors.Slowly add 2 ml of 2x HBSS and mix gently by pipetting up and down.Add 250 μl of 2 M CaCl2 drop by drop.Incubate 10 min at room temperature to precipitate the DNA. Replace the 293T cell culture media with 40 ml of fresh DMEM culture media pre-warmed to 37 °C.Slowly add 4 ml of DNA precipitate and incubate for 16 h at 37 °C.Replace the media with 40 ml of fresh DMEM culture media pre-warmed to 37 °C.Incubate for 24 h at 37 °C.Harvest the supernatant of the transfected 293T cells into a 50-ml Falcon tube.Centrifuge the supernatant at 365 x g at room temperature for 10 min to remove the cellular debris.Filter the clarified supernatant through Steriflip.Transfer 36 ml of virion-containing supernatant to Ultra-Clear centrifuge tubes.Place the tube in the bucket of the SW28 rotor and balance the tube with DMEM culture media if necessary.Ultracentrifuge (72,000 x g, 90 min) at 4 °C without using brakes.Remove the supernatant, resuspend the viral pellet in 1 ml of DMEM, divide into 100-μl aliquots, and store at -80 °C.Quantify p24Gag content of the viral preparation by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay or FlaQ Assay (Maiti et al., 2014).Wash the PBLs with RPMI culture media.Count PBLs and make a suspension 2 x 107 cells/ml in RPMI culture media.Divide the cell suspension in aliquots of 100 μl (2 x 106 cells) per condition to be tested in a V-bottom 96-well plate.",
    "Distribute two additional aliquots of cells into two wells to serve as compensation controls. One well will be loaded with CCF2 substrate while the other will remain unloaded. These two control wells will not be stained with anti-CD3-APC-Cy7 and anti-CD4-PE-Cy7 antibodies. Add a quantity of HIV-1 virions containing BlaM-Vpr equivalent to 400 ng of p24Gag to all wells except the “non infected control” and the two compensation controls. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.Collect the cells by centrifugation at 365 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Wash the cells once with 200 μl of CO2-independent media and centrifuge at 365 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Resuspend the pellet in 100 μl of CCF2-AM loading solution and incubate for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Make sure to keep one well unstained by resuspending with CO2 independent media only. Collect the cells by centrifugation at 365 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Wash the cells with 200 μl of development media and centrifuge at 365 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Resuspend the pellet in 200 μl of development media and incubate the cells at room temperature for 16 h in the dark.In two empty wells, add one drop of each of BD compensation beads vials (negative control and Anti-mouse IgK).Collect the cells and beads by centrifugation at 365 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Wash the cells and beads once by addition of 200 μl of FACS staining buffer.Collect the cells by centrifugation at 365 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspend the pellet in 100 μl of immunostaining solution (in FACS staining buffer) containing a 1/100 dilution of anti-CD3-APC-Cy7 and a 1/50 dilution of anti-CD4-PE-Cy7. Do not stain the 2 compensation controls nor the beads.",
    "Stain the CompBeads with a FACS staining buffer containing either a 1/100 dilution of anti-CD3-APC, or a 1/50 dilution of anti-CD4-PE-Cy7.Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C.Collect the cells and beads by centrifugation at 365 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Wash the cells and beads with 200 μl of FACS staining buffer.Fix the cells in FACS staining buffer supplemented with 1.2% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C.Acquire the samples on a FACS instrument. The set of samples should include: unloaded unstained cells, the CCF2 loaded unstained cells, the CD3-APC-Cy7 stained beads, the CD4-PE-Cy7 stained beads, the non-infected control loaded with CCF2 and immunostained, and the infected samples loaded with CCF2 and immunostained. Make sure to acquire emission in the FITC channel in addition to the parameters of the assay (uncleaved and cleaved substrate, APC-Cy7 and PE-Cy7). The voltage should be set using the non-infected, immunostained sample. Import the fcs files into the FlowJo software. Use the fcs files corresponding to the CompBeads to compensate for APC-Cy7 and PE-Cy7, use the CCF2 loaded and unloaded samples to compensate in the FITC channel. Apply the compensation to all samples.Gate the cells as shown Figure 2."
