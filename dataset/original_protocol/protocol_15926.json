    "mPlum-pBAD FP is expressed in One Shot TOP10 electrocompetent E. coli cells. The mPlum construct used in this article has an N-terminal poly-histidine affinity tag and is purified by two-step purification, including immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The purity of the sample is evaluated by SEC and sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A high-quality protein sample shows a predominant protein band at an expected molecular weight of 29.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE and a single, symmetrical peak with an elution volume >50 ml on SEC (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.745#cpz1745-fig-0001]). This protocol will allow researchers to produce recombinant mPlum, but it can also be adapted for the production of other FPs of interest.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0b7bb3aa-d3b3-446c-9e9c-fe74086220d5/cpz1745-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSEC (A) and SDS-PAGE (B) of mPlum.\nMaterials\nmPlum-pBAD (gift from Michael Davidson and Roger Tsien; Addgene, plasmid cat. no. 54564; http://n2t.net/addgene:54564[href=http://n2t.net/addgene:54564]; RRID: Addgene_54564)\nQiagen Plus Maxi Kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 12963)\nOne Shot TOP10 electrocompetent E. coli cells (Invitrogen, cat. no.

    "Carboxylate microspheres can be purchased from several sources. They come in various sizes and can come dyed in different colors or with fluorescent characteristics. The microspheres (also referred to as beads) used in this protocol are composed of 4.5-µm undyed carboxylate polystyrene. Although larger beads can bind more protein, there will be fewer beads per milliliter of suspension, and larger beads settle more quickly. These beads are found to bind enough FPs to compare well with all but the brightest FP-expressing cells.\nFigure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.745#cpz1745-fig-0002] demonstrates the results of coupling of nine FPs to beads. The relative brightness of each of the FPs coupled in our laboratory is shown in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.745#cpz1745-tbl-0001].

Vortex briefly then add 250 µg purified FP suspended in 100 μl of 90% (v/v) DPBS and 10% (v/v) glycerol.\nSome experimentation may be required. Ideally, the 250 µg FP will be in a volume <100 µl (so the initial concentration of FP should be ≥2.5 mg/ml). Glycerol does not interfere with coupling, so a concentration of 0% to 10% glycerol will yield comparable results.\n9. Incubate for 4 hr on a rotary mixer at room temperature.",

    "FP-coupled beads (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.745#cpz1745-prot-0002]) may have a slightly different fluorescent signature compared to cells expressing the same FP. When using the Cytek Aurora, unmixing can be performed using FP-coupled beads. Single FP–expressing cells can then be acquired on the instrument. There may be some “unmixing errors.” This protocol will enable investigators to compare the spectral signature of cells expressing FPs and beads coupled to FPs. These differences are very small with some FPs, whereas with others, the difference is greater. Care must be taken to ensure that the cells not expressing FPs (negative cells) and the FP-expressing cells have the same autofluorescence. Similar disparity can be observed when using polystyrene antibody capture beads. The median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) from all fluorescence channels for blank beads, FP-coupled beads, unstained cells, and FP-expressing cells can be exported from SpectroFlo to Excel™ (Microsoft) or other graphing software. The values from the negative particles can be subtracted from those for the respective positive particles to give the values from the FPs regardless of the autofluorescence of the particles themselves. These fluorescent signatures can be normalized and the differences measured as is described below. The similarity index (SI) described in Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.745#cpz1745-prot-0004] cannot be used for this, as it only allows comparisons of reference controls.\nMaterials\n4.5-µm polystyrene microspheres with no FP (blank beads; see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.745#cpz1745-prot-0002])\nDPBS (Gibco, cat. no. 14190144)\n4.5-µm polystyrene microspheres (beads) coupled to FP (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.745#cpz1745-prot-0002])\nNon-FP-expressing parental cells (e.g., HEK 293T)\nFP-expressing cells (e.g., HEK 293T)\nVortex (optional)\n12 × 75–mm polystyrene test tubes (Falcon, Corning, cat. no. 352054)\nSpectroFlo software, v3.x (Cytek Bio)\nCytek Aurora spectral cytometer (Cytek Bio)\nMicrosoft Excel or similar\n1.

    "2. Dispense one drop of blank beads into a 12 × 75–mm polystyrene test tube (∼40 µl). Add 200 µl DPBS.\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 but with 4.5-µm polystyrene microspheres coupled to FP.\nThis process can have one or more FPs.\n4. Add 200 µl non-FP-expressing parental cells (hereafter referred to as unstained cells) to a 12 × 75–mm test tube (∼50,000 cells).\n5. Add 200 µl FP-expressing cells to a 12 × 75–mm test tube (∼50,000 cells).\n6. Open SpectroFlo software and choose “default experiment.”\nAs only raw data are used in this protocol, no unmixing is required, and only raw data files are analyzed. As no unmixing is required, no reference group is required. The Cytek Assay Setting gains should be used. See the Cytek Aurora User's Guide.\n7. Install the tube of blank beads in the Cytek Aurora spectral cytometer and click “acquire.” Adjust forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC) to position the beads in a central position on the FSC and SSC plot. Create a gate around the beads called P1. Set cytometer to acquire 10,000 events within the P1 gate. Click “record.” Repeat the process for the FP-coupled beads.\n8. Repeat step 7 for the unstained and FP-expressing cells.\nThe FSC and SSC gain will need to be adjusted. Custom settings can be saved, one for beads the other for cells. Note, the gains of all the fluorescence channels should not be changed. The P1 gate will have to be moved between beads and cells.\n9. Viewing a raw worksheet where all the unmixed channels are present, create a statistics box to include only the MFIs of all fluorescence channels and the parameter name. Right-click the statistics box to save these values as a CSV file.",
    "This process is repeated for each sample.\n10. Create a spreadsheet with the parameter names in row 1, the MFI values of each fluorescence channel from the blank beads in row 2, and the MFI values of the FP-coupled beads in row 3. In row 4, calculate the values derived from subtracting the blank-bead MFIs from the FP-bead MFIs, thus giving the median value of the FP in each channel without the autofluorescence contribution of the blank beads (these values can be referred to as corrected MFIs, or CMFIs). Normalize these CMFI values by dividing each value in row 4 by the highest value in row 4, ensuring that highest fluorescence value will be 1. Create a scatter plot in Microsoft Excel or similar, with the fluorescence channel along the x-axis and the normalized CMFI on the y-axis.\n11. Repeat step 10 for unstained and FP-expressing cells.\nNormalizing the data allows samples with different fluorescence intensities to be overlaid and compared. The shape of the curve is the spectral signature. We now have the fluorescence signatures of both the cells and the beads without the contribution of autofluorescence of either beads or cells.\n12. Comparing the normalized values of the CMFIs for cells and beads, calculate the differences in these values for each channel between cells and beads. Determine the sum of these values, referred to as the difference index (DI).\n13. Normalize the DI by dividing the DI value by the DI value of beads that share little spectral similarity, such as CFP- and mCherry-coupled beads, to produce a metric referred to as the corrected difference index, or CDI.\nSamples with identical spectral signatures will have a CDI value of 0, and samples with few similarities will have a CDI value near 1.",
    "Please see the table in the Supporting Information[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.745#support-information-section] for a template allowing calculation of these metrics. Several examples are given to demonstrate a value of 0: beads versus cells, two lots of mCherry-coupled beads, mCherry- versus CFP-coupled beads, and two instances of the same mCherry-coupled beads. Data can be inserted into this template to determine the difference between the spectral signatures of two samples. The CDI is an arbitrary value, but it is a simply a convenient measure of how different two spectral signatures are. It can be used to determine the difference between bead-bound and cell-associated FPs, two different FPs, FPs and fluorescent antibodies, and two different fluorescent antibodies, among other comparisons.",
    "This protocol describes how to use the SI and complexity index (CI) in SpectroFlo software to measure the similarity of the reference controls within an experiment and how to use FlowJo software to look at the spreading of the reference controls. This can be helpful when planning an experiment to determine the likely success of a panel. This protocol uses unmixed data.\nAdditional Materials (also see Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.745#cpz1745-prot-0003])\nFlowJo software, v10.x (BD Biosciences)\n1.

Create an experiment in SpectroFlo and select the fluorochromes (FPs) used in the experiment.\nThe unstained sample will be cells expressing no FPs. The reference controls will be each type of FP-coupled beads. An extra negative control should be created and called blank beads. This can be used as the negative control for each FP sample. The Cytek Assay Setting gains should be used.\nThe FSC and SSC gain will need to be adjusted. Custom settings can be saved, one for beads and the other for cells. Note that the gains of all the fluorescence channels should not be changed. The P1 gate will have to be moved between beads and cells.\nSee the Cytek Aurora User's Guide for more information.\n6. Run the unstained cells and then each of the reference controls. Select “unmix,” click “next,” and choose the “QC controls” tab. Select the “similarity matrix” button and then select “View Similarity Matrix.” Export the matrix.",
    "7. Open FlowJo software and use “add samples” to import all reference-control FCS files (these will all be unmixed FCS files). Drag the single FP–coupled beads and the blank beads onto the Compensation group.\n8. Open the compensation tool. Display the compensation matrix and then click on the “SSM” button and choose “export SSM.”\nThe resulting CSV file can be opened in Microsoft Excel or another graphing software.\nIn SpectroFlo, the SI matrix will have a value for each pair of FPs. Another value, referred to as the complexity matrix, will also be shown. Identical FPs or FPs that are very similar will have an SI of 1. FPs with no similarities will have a value of 0. The complexity matrix gives a measure of the total overlap between all the FPs chosen and is useful for panel design.\nIn FlowJo, the spillover spread matrix (SSM) shows how much each of the FPs will spread into other channels intended for other FPs."
