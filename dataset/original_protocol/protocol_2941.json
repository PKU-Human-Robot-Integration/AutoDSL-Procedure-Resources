    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTissue dissection\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step details how to dissect and collect chorion and decidua basalis / villous tissues.\nFirst, remove the amnion by placing the placenta with the fetal surface (umbilical cord side) facing upwards.\nManually peel off the amnion from the chorion towards the umbilical cord.\nRemove and discard the amnion completely (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2685-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Placental tissue dissection\n(A) Manually separate the amnion from the chorio-decidual membrane, peeling the amnion towards the umbilical cord insertion site. Discard the amnion.\n(B and C) Drape the chorio-decidual membrane on palm with decidual surface facing upwards and (C) gently separate decidua parietalis from chorion.\n(D) Using scissors, 2 × 1 cm2 thin sections of decidua basalis are carefully cut from the maternal side of the placenta. Collect approximately 15–20 pieces.\n(E and F) Lay decidua basalis on finger carefully with villi (roughly textured surface) facing upwards, and then (F) carefully remove villi from decidua basalis with scissors, avoid buttonholing the decidua basalis.\n(G and H) The final product should have a fine layer of villi on the decidua basalis.\nTo collect the chorionic membrane, gently scrape the chorion from the maternal decidua parietalis, using sterile curved tip forceps (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nAvoid necrotic or thickened, inflamed tissue and blood clots.\nDo not allow chorionic membranes to dry out at any time.\nCollect approx. 30 mL of chorionic membrane tissue in a labeled 50 mL conical tube containing 20 mL wash medium A (see Materials). Wash Medium A can be prepared ahead of time and stored at 4°C until use.\nCollect decidua parietalis tissue in a labeled 50 mL conical tube containing 20 mL wash medium A (see Materials), for decidual lymphocyte isolation as described in Ikumi et al., 2023.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]",
    "To collect decidua basalis tissue, turn the placenta over so that the maternal surface (basal plate with cotyledons) is facing upwards.\nCarefully cut thin pieces of approximately L = 2 x W = 1 x H = 0.5 cm3 size from the placenta basal plate using sterile scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nAvoid necrotic tissue and blood clots.\nGently spread out each piece of decidua basalis on your finger with the villi facing upwards.\nUsing scissors, carefully remove extra villi from the decidua basalis, until a 2–3 mm thin membrane remains (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E and 1F).\nA fine layer of villi should remain attached to decidua basalis (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G and 1H).\nNote: This is distinct from the decidua basalis tissue collection with complete villi removal as described in the lymphocyte isolation protocol by Ikumi et al., Star Protocols 2023.\nCollect approx. 15 mL decidua basalis tissue in a labeled 50 mL conical tube containing 30 mL 1× PBS.\nContinue to process chorion and decidua basalis tissue separately.\nTissue washing and digestion\nTiming: 2.5 h\nThis step details how to wash and then digest the placental tissues.\nWash the tissues without centrifugation by adding sterile 1× PBS into each of the conical tubes.\nWait until the tissue settles in the lower half of the tube (for approximately 1 min).\nCarefully discard the supernatant by either pouring it out or using a serological pipette.\nFill up the tubes with PBS and wash all tissues several times until the PBS is clear and there is no blood visible.\nCut the tissue into small (1–2 mm2) pieces inside the 50 mL falcon tube using scissors.\nWash the tissues without centrifugation by adding sterile 1× PBS into each of the conical tubes until the PBS is clear as described in step 5.",
    "After the last wash step, let the tissues settle for 2 min to the bottom of the 50 mL conical tubes until no debris is visible in the PBS supernatant and measure the tissue volumes.\nDivide tissues between multiple conical tubes and create one tube containing 30 mL chorionic membrane and two tubes containing 7.5 mL decidua basalis tissue.\nNote: Dividing the decidua basalis tissue over two tubes optimizes the digestion and minimizes risk for over or under digestions (see trouble shooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nFill up all tubes with 1× PBS and centrifuge at 200 g for 1 min. Then carefully discard the supernatant.\nTransfer chorionic membrane tissue into a separate labeled 300 mL sterile bottle. Transfer each 7.5 mL of decidua basalis tissue into separate labeled 300 mL sterile bottles.\nAdd 125 mL Tissue Digestion Enzyme Cocktail A (see Materials) to bottle containing chorionic membranes and 100 mL to each of the two bottles containing decidua basalis. Enzyme cocktail A can be made ahead of time. Make 10 mL aliquots and store at −20°C until use.\nPlace the bottles containing decidua basalis tissue in the 37°C water bath and the bottle with chorionic tissue in the 39°C water bath for 15 min.\nAgitate bottles every 3 min by hand for 30 s.\nNote: Chorion is digested at a higher temperature than decidua basalis to optimize digestion. Digesting chorionic tissue at 37°C results in under digestion.\nFiltration\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis step details how to filter placental tissues after digestion.\nRemove the bottles from the water bath.\nLet the tissue settle to the bottom of the bottles for approximately 1 min and filter the supernatants through a metal dissociation sieve placed in a 15 cm petri dish.",
    "Gently stir the solutions through the sieve (mesh size 40) with the back of a transfer pipette to strain the supernatant into the petri dish.\nContinue to filter the remaining tissue through the metal dissociation sieve by adding 10–30 mL Wash Medium B to the tissue (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\ngently stir the solution through the sieve with the back of a transfer pipette to strain the supernatant into the petri dish.\nCritical: When stirring the tissue and liquid in the strainer do not attempt to grind the remaining tissue through the filter as this will result in impurities.\nFollowing digestion 1, use new clean metal sieves for digestion 2.\nTransfer the undigested chorion and decidua basalis tissue into two separate 50 mL sterile conical tubes, fill tubes with sterile ×1 PBS and centrifuge tissues at 650 g for 7 min.\nCarefully discard the supernatant and transfer chorion and decidua basalis tissues into two labeled 300 mL bottles and repeat steps 12 through 16. This is digestion 2.\nFilter all supernatants from the petri dishes through 100 μm cell strainers into 50 mL conical tubes, labeled with the tissue type and the digestion number.\nMaintain first digestion preparations separate from second digestion preparations for both the chorionic membranes and the decidua basalis tissue.\nCentrifuge filtered supernatants at 650 g for 7 min, discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellets with 5 mL Wash Medium B using a 2.5 mL bulb transfer pipette.\nCombine cell pellets of the same tissue type and digestion number into one tube, to create a total of 4 tubes: i) chorion digest 1; ii) chorion digest 2; iii) basalis digest 1; and iv) basalis digest 2.\nFill up tubes with Wash Medium B to a total of 25 mL per tube.\nDensity gradient centrifugation",
    "Timing: 0.5 h\nThis step details how to load suspensions on Ficoll gradients for density gradient centrifugation.\nPipette 12.5 mL undiluted Ficoll into four 50 mL conical tubes (one for each digest). Carefully layer 25 mL of resuspended cells over Ficoll, being careful not to mix the layers.\nCentrifuge tubes at 800 g for 20 min (RT) without a brake.\nOnce the centrifugation is complete, there will be a distinct cell layer at the interface in each tube.\nUsing a sterile transfer pipette, carefully collect the layer at the interface of each Ficoll tube and transfer it into a separate 50 mL conical tube.\nFill up the tubes with Wash Medium B (see materials) and centrifuge at 650 g for 7 min.\nCarefully decant the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets containing EVT in 1 mL Wash Medium B.\nCell sorting\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step details how purify cells using flow cytometry.\nFor cell sorting of EVT, add anti-CD45-APC (1:50); anti-EGRF1-AF488 (1:50); anti-HLA-G-PE (1:100) antibodies. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature (20°C) and in the dark.\nAdd 2 mL Wash Medium B and centrifuge cells at 650 g for 7 min.\nDiscard supernatant and carefully resuspend cell pellets in 1.0 mL Wash Medium B.\nFilter cells through a 40 μM cell strainer and transfer to a 5 mL sterile FACS tube with cap.\nSort CD45-HLA-G + EVT cells in Wash Medium B according to the gating strategy depicted in (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) using a 100 μM Nozzle at room temperature (20°C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2685-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Cell culture Medium A should be made fresh on the day of use.\nTransfer cell culture plates to humidified CO2 37°C incubator and let EVT adhere for 2 h.\nAfter this incubation the HLA-G+ EVT are ready for experimentation (including infection and/or co-culture with lymphocyte fractions to study maternal – fetal interactions).\nEstablish EVT-like cell lines\nTiming: 14 days\nThis step details how to establish primary EVT-like cell lines.",
    "Plate HLA-G+ EVT onto collagen-coated flat bottom culture wells. Choice of cell well size is dependent on the number of sorted HLA-G+ EVT.\nNote: It is critical to maintain optimal cell concentration to support EVT growth and proliferation. For EVT cell fractions of:\n0.5–1 × 105 EVT, seed in 48 well cell culture plate in 200 μL Complete Cell Culture Medium B;\n1–5 × 105 EVT, seed in 24 well cell culture plates in 1 mL Complete Cell Culture Medium B;\n0.5–1 × 106 EVT, seed in 12 well cell culture plates in 1.5 mL Complete Cell Culture Medium B.\n1–2 × 106 EVT, seed in 6 well cell culture plates in 2 mL Complete Cell Culture Medium B.\nNote: Complete cell culture Medium B should be made fresh on the day of use.\nTransfer cell culture plates to humidified CO2 37°C incubator.\nAfter 12–20 h, replace culture medium with fresh Complete Cell Culture Medium B. This removes dead cells and leaves viable EVT (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2685-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The scale bars indicate 100 μm.\nReplace tissue medium with fresh Complete Cell Culture Medium B every two days as described (6).\nTransfer or split EVT cultures dependent on culture confluency as follows:",
    "If at day 3–7 after plating, EVT have 80%–90% confluency (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C), transfer EVT to two same sized collagen pre-coated culture wells.\nIf at day 7 after plating, EVT have 40%–80% confluency, transfer the EVT to one same sized collagen pre-coated culture well.\nIf at day 7 after plating, EVT have 10%–40% confluency, transfer the EVT to a smaller sized collagen pre-coated culture well.\nTo transfer EVT-like cell lines:\nIn a tissue culture hood, remove cell culture medium and add room temperature TrypLE Trypsin to wells:\n1.5 mL TrypLE to a 6 well;\n1 mL TrypLE to a 12 well;\n0.7 mL TrypLE to a 24 well;\nor 0.1 mL TrypLE to a 48 well.\nIncubate 5 min at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nAssess cells with a light microscope to confirm cell detachment from the culture plate. When cells detach, move on to step 45. If not, incubate another 3 min and assess detachment again.\nRepeat until EVT are detached. On occasion, EVT may require incubation of up to 20 min for detachment.\nOnce EVT are detached, gently agitate the cells from the plate with a p1000 pipette and transfer to a 15 mL sterile conical tube. Rinse wells with sterile Tissue Culture Medium A to ensure complete cell collection.\nCentrifuge collected cells at 650 g for 7 min with a medium brake.\nDiscard the supernatant and gently resuspend the cell pellet in fresh Complete Cell Culture Medium B by flicking the tubes.\nTransfer cells to appropriately sized, collagen-coated flat bottom culture well.",
    "If after 4–6 transfer cycles, EVT-like cell lines are growing well such that 80%–90% confluency is achieved within 5–7 days after plating (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D), the EVT-like cell lines can be frozen for future research. Following step 46, add freeze medium A and transfer cells to sterile 1.2 mL cryo tube.\nNote: Freeze Medium A should be made fresh on the day of use.\nSlow freeze in cool cell at −80°C prior to transferring to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.\nCritical: Maintaining optimal cell concentration with each transfer is imperative to supporting EVT growth and proliferation. Sparsely populated wells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) and overly confluent cultures (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F) are at risk of growth failure. Pre-coated collagen wells should be ready with medium to receive EVT-like cells; delays to transfer increase risk of cell death.\nPhenotyping of EVT-like cell lines\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step details how to phenotype EVT-like cell lines using flow cytometry.\nTrypsinize EVT-like cell lines as described in steps 44–46.\nAdd 2 × 105 cells to a 5 mL FACS tube in 100 μL basal medium.\nAdd cell surface antibodies for ITGA6, ECAD, EGFR1, ITGA6, HLA-G, HLA-E, HLA-C, PDL1 and B7-H3.\nIncubate 20 min at room temperature in the dark.\nAdd 2 mL basal medium and centrifuge cells at 650 g for 7 min. Discard supernatant and carefully resuspend cell pellets in 0.5 mL basal medium.\nAcquire cells directly on a flow cytometer. Leaving the cells too long will lead to reduced cell viability.\nThe phenotype of the EVT-like cell lines should include the expression of ITGA6, ECAD, EGFR1, ITGA5, HLA-G, HLA-E, HLA-C, PDL1 and B7-H3 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) and the absence of HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 expression (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2685-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Phenotype of EVT-like cell lines",
    "(A) EVT-like cell lines established from two donors of 6–12 week villi (TL1 and TL2); villi /d.basalis >37 week (TL3 and TL4) and chorion > 37 weeks (TL5 and TL6) all express high levels of ITGA6 and E-cadherin (ECAD) as shown in the FACS plots. Different cells lines with high and low HLA-G expression were established from each tissue.\n(B) Similar to primary HLA-G+ EVT, EVT-like cell lines also express the EVT markers ITGA5 and EGFR1, co-inhibitory molecules PDL1 and B7-H3, and HLA-C and HLA-E.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2685-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Thus, the EVT-like cell lines cells described here do not resemble trophoblast stem cells established by Okae et al., 2018.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Yet the EVT-like cell lines may not be fully differentiated EVT as they maintain high proliferative capacity and maybe a EVT precursor.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7],8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] Further studies elucidating the phenotype and differentiation state of EVT-like cell lines compared to primary cells and trophoblast stem cells are essential.",
    "Note: Using the EVT differentiation protocol described in Okae et al., 20186[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] on these EVT-like cell lines resulted in over 95% cell death. This high cell death may be due to differences between EVT-like cell lines and human trophoblast stem (hTS) cells that result in distinct differentiation requirements for EVT-like cell lines and TS cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated EVT.\nCo-culture of primary HLA-G+ EVT or HLA-G+ EVT like cell lines with lymphocytes\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step details how to set up co-cultures of HLA-G+ EVT or HLA-G+ EVT like cell lines with lymphocytes.\nIsolate primary lymphocytes from the same placenta according to the protocols described by Ikumi et al. 2023.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nSeed 5 × 104 HLA-G+ EVT in 100 μL Cell Culture Medium A on fibronectin-coated flat bottom 48 well culture plates or 5 × 104 HLA-G+ EVT-like cell lines in 100 μL Complete Cell Culture Medium B on collagen-coated flat bottom 48 well culture plates.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nAdd 1 × 105 purified NK cells, T cells or macrophages in 100 μL Cell Culture Medium C to the HLA-G+ EVT. Cell culture medium A and C should always be mixed 1:1 to maintain EVT and leukocyte viability.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nAdd 2.5 ng/mL IL-15 to NK cultures and 50 U/mL IL-2 to T cell cultures to maintain their viability.\nFor negative controls include additional wells only containing HLA-G+ EVT or leukocyte fractions.\nFor positive controls include additional wells with 1 μg/mL PMA and 1 μg/mL Ionomycin (NK cells and T cells); 1 μg/mL anti-CD3/CD28 beads (T cells) or 100 ng/mL LPS (macrophages)."
