    "All experimental procedures described below were approved by Local Ethical Committee at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences.\nNote: Some of the scenes in the associated video are accelerated. Speed factor is indicated in these scenes.\n1. Surgery Preparation\nSterilize all tools, glass containers for liquids and cotton swabs in the autoclave. Use dispensable gloves. Clean the surgical table, the stereotaxic frame and all the surrounding area with 70% ethanol. Use a sterile surgical pad to create a sterile space for all the sterilized equipment. Cut gelfoam into small pieces and soak them in sterile saline.\n\tNote: According to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, ethanol is neither a sterilant nor a high-level disinfectant. It should only be used as a cleaning/defatting agent on previously sterilized surfaces.\nPut the animal in the induction chamber and set the isoflurane level to 5% and oxygen flow to 2 L/min. This procedure should take about 3 min.\nTake the animal out of the induction chamber. Use tail or toe pinches in order to ensure that the animal is fully sedated.\nUsing a precise trimmer shave the hair from the back of the head (between the ears) up to the eyes.\nPlace the animal in the stereotaxic frame and stabilize the head with ear bars.\nSet anesthesia levels to 1.5-2% isoflurane and 0.3 L/min oxygen.\nApply the eye ointment.\nInject the animal subcutaneously with Tolfedine (4 mg/kg), Butomidor (2 mg/kg) and Baytril (5 mg/kg) to prevent inflammation, pain and infection, respectively.\nInject the animal intramuscularly with Dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg) to prevent brain swelling.\nNote: It is possible to inject Dexamethasone subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to prevent muscle damage.\nClean the skin using sterile cotton swabs with Betadine followed by 70% ethanol.",
    "Change the gloves and spray them with 70% ethanol.\nNote: While using disposable gloves do not touch the sterile field. Touch the animal only with the tips of sterile surgical instruments and sterile swabs.\n2. Cranial Window Surgery\nLift the skin with forceps and using micro scissors incise the skin horizontally along the base of the head and then obliquely to the front point between the eyes. Remove the skin flap.\nApply lidocaine ointment with a sterile swab on the periosteum to prevent excessive bleeding and pain.\nUse sterile cotton swabs or a scalpel to remove the periosteum. Dry the skull with sterile swabs.\nUsing a sterile needle apply dense cyanoacrylate glue on the skin edges to immobilize them and to prevent from contact with dental cement. Wait for the glue to dry.\nLay a sterile 3 mm coverglass over the skull anteriorly to the lambdoid suture. Center the coverslip at RSC coordinates: AP, bregma -2.8; ML, bregma 0. Mark the coverslip edges by scratching the skull surface with a sterile needle. Put the coverglass back into the sterile container with 70% ethanol.\nUse a high-speed dental drill with small diameter burr to outline a 3 mm diameter circle. Clean the drilling site from the bone dust with sterile saline dipped swabs. Use the gelfoam and swabs to stop the occasional bleeding and clean the bone.\nIn between drilling check the bone thickness with fine forceps by gently touching the bone circle and checking its mobility. Keep in mind that the bone is thicker on the suture's area. Stop the drilling when the bone circle is mobile and only an even, thin layer of bone is left on the circumference. Clean the operational field of all the remaining bone dust with saline dipped swabs.",
    "Drop the sterile saline on the drilling area, covering the drilled circle. Carefully pry the bone circle with fine forceps and then gently but firmly remove the bone by lifting it upwards. Be careful not to skew the bone circle while lifting it to prevent possible damage to the dura.\nGently apply the gelfoam soaked in sterile saline on the dura to help stop the bleeding. Wait until all bleeding is fully stopped. Carefully remove the gelfoam not to disturb the clotting process.\n\tNote: The suture area is highly vascularized, so the bleeding at this point might prove to be profound. It is essential to wait for the sufficient time for the bleeding to stop completely. It is helpful to keep the saline-soaked gelfoam cooled by placing it on ice.\n3. Virus Injection\nAttach the infusion pump to the stereotactic tower and connect the controller.\nInsert the 35G needle into the syringe. Flush the syringe 10 times with ethanol to sterilize it and 10 times with sterile saline to remove traces of ethanol. Remove air bubbles from the syringe. Insert the syringe into the pump.\n\tNote: Consider using other disinfectants.\nThaw a single dose of rAAV2/1mCherry preparation (1012 pfu is recommended) and keep it on ice. Fill the syringe with the virus solution.\nCenter the needle on the bregma and then gently insert into the hippocampus using the following coordinates: AP -2, ML +/- 1.0, DV -1. These coordinates will be located near the edge of the craniotomy. Wait for 5 min for the tissue to stabilize.\nInject 0.7 µl of the rAAV2/1mCherry solution at the rate of 50 nl/min. Wait 10 min for the virus to fully adsorb. Gently remove the needle. Blot with gelfoam if bleeding occurs. Repeat with the contralateral site.\n4. Cranial Window Implantation",
    "Lay the sterile, dried coverglass on the top of the dura in the drilled circle frame. Hold the coverglass with the forceps to gently flatten the dura and bring coverglass' edges closer to the skull surface.\nNote: It is possible that the coverglass disrupts the clot and the bleeding resumes. If that is the case, lift the coverglass, place it in alcohol, dry and return to step 2.9.\nUsing a sterile needle apply the dense cyanoacrylate glue on the coverglass edges to attach them to the skull. Wait for the glue to dry.\nPlace a fixation bar (M2 nut or a custom made design) in the front part of the skull. Apply the cyanoacrylate glue over the edges of the bar. Wait for the glue to dry.\n\t\nPlace the fixation bar in a position that will enable horizontal positioning of the cranial window during imaging session. Place it as distant as possible from the window. If it is placed too close to the window, the bar and the screw connecting it with the custom-made holder might pose as an obstacle for the objective during the imaging process.\nPrepare the dental acrylic and apply it on the skull surface around the glass. It is helpful to form a crater-like shape around the window. It will create a cavity for water applied later for imaging with the water objective.\nCreate a cap with the dental acrylic, covering the rest of the operational area, skin edges, fixation bar, reinforcing the crater around the cranial window. Wait for the dental cement to harden.\nRemove the animal from the stereotaxic frame and put it into the recovery chamber.\nWait for the animal to recover from the surgery while observing the physiological functions.",
    "Apply post-operative analgesia (carprofen, 10 mg/kg) and antibiotics treatment (baytril, 5 mg/kg) for 48 hr.\n5. Imaging\nStart the Ti:Sapphire laser, power up the microscope. The system used in this experiment is equipped with a two-photon laser, OPO system and dual GaAsP PMT.\nPut the animal in the induction chamber and induce anesthesia.\nRemove the animal from the induction chamber and place in the gas anesthesia mask under the microscope. Decrease the oxygen flow to 0.3 L/min and the isoflurane concentration to 1.5-2%.\nFix the animal to the custom microscope frame with a M2 screw (or another custom system). Level the cranial window.\nNote: It is possible to use the microscope manufacturer's head fixation system, although the specific custom frame gives better results (improved head stability, constant positioning in multiple sessions during a chronic experiment).\nUsing the widefield microscope settings and a low magnification objective center the view on one of the sides of retrosplenial cortex and focus it on the coverslip surface.\nApply a droplet of water into the crater-like acrylic well. Switch to a long distance water immersion objective. Move the objective towards the cranial window until the water meniscus connects the specimen and objective.\nSwitch to two-photon settings and begin scanning the specimen top to bottom using lowest zoom. The crossing of dura mater will be visible as a glare of high non-specific signal.\nAdjust the microscope acquisition settings in both channels (GFP and mCherry) according to the signal strength from fluorescent cells in order to cover the entire dynamic range.\nAfter finding a suitable neuron (with the dendritic tree separated from other cells) perform an initial scan using only the GFP filterset with lowest zoom and z-distance of 5 microns.\nObtain a maximum projection of the scanned stack and print it for annotations (using inverted colors).",
    "Set zoom to a value that will allow to image the desired morphological details. Image the entire dendritic tree in the GFP and mCherry channels using maximum projection as guide.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
