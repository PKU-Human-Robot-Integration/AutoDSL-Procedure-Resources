    "The Medical Sciences Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee (IDREC) University of Oxford provided approval for this protocol (Ref No: MS-IDREC-C1-2015-200, R46287/RE002, and R42687/RE004).\n1. Design and conditions\nConduct three experiments in the following fixed order with all participants: Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3, with no break between them. Make sure that all participants in Experiment 2 participated in Experiment 1 and all participants in Experiment 3 also in Experiment 2 (and Experiment 1).\nConduct Experiment 1 – a pre-test-post-test design, with three experimental groups: Blind, blindfold, and vision; and three repeated within-group measures. Present the trials in fixed order to all participants. (Total number of trials: 8.)\n\t\nConduct the pre-test (Trial 1) to test the instant tactile/visual-auditory bouba/kiki-effect.\nConduct the first repeated within-group measure (Trial 4) to test the effect of repeated tactile/visual shape (either filled or outlined) and varied audio (word and non-word sound).\nConduct the second within-group measure (Trial 5) to test the effect of new tactile/visual shape (either outlined or filled) and varied audio (word and non-word sound).\nConduct the third within-group measure and post-test (Trial 8) to test the effect of varied tactile/visual shape (filled and outlined) and varied audio (word and non-word sound).\nRandomly assign which type of tactile/visual bouba/kiki shapes to present in trials 1-4 (either filled or outlined). Present the other type in trials 4-8. Then, randomly assign which auditory word (either bouba or kiki) to present in Trial 1, and which auditory bouba/kiki (either bouba or kiki and either word or non-word sound) to present in each one of Trials 2-8.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that in total, there are four bouba and four kiki trials; four filled and four outlined tactile/visual shape trials; four auditory word and four auditory non-word sound trials.",
    "Conduct Experiment 2 – a within-subject design, with three experimental groups: Blind, blindfold, and vision; and two within-group measures. Present the trials in fixed order to all participants. (Total number of trials: 8)\n\t\nTest the instant recognition of congruous (bouba/kiki + bouba/kiki) shape-audio (Trial 1).\nTest the recognition of (a) congruous (bouba/kiki + bouba/kiki), and (b) incongruous (bouba/kiki + kiki/bouba) shape-audio [across four trials per type of congruousness (Trials 1-8)].\nRandomly assign which type of tactile/visual bouba/kiki shape (either filled or outlined) to present in trials 1-8. Then, randomly assign which congruous tactile/visual shape and auditory non-word sound (either bouba + bouba or kiki + kiki) to present in Trial 1, and finally which type of congruousness (either congruous or incongruous tactile/visual bouba/kiki shape + auditory bouba/kiki non-word sound) to present in each one of Trials 2-8.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that in total, there are four tactile/visual bouba and four tactile/visual kiki trials; four filled and four outlined tactile/visual trials; four congruous and four incongruous (shape + non-word sound) trials. (The auditory bouba/kiki word is not included in this experiment.)\nConduct Experiment 3 – a post-test only design, with three experimental groups: Blind, blindfold, and vision. Present the trials in fixed order to all participants (Total number of trials: 4).\n\t\nTest what mental images the training in noticing shape-audio regularities (i.e. Experiment 1 and Experiment 2) have produced, in four separate trials: Bouba word, bouba non-word sound, kiki word, and kiki non-word sound.\nRandomly assign which type of auditory bouba/kiki (either bouba or kiki and either word or non-word sound) to present in each one of Trials 1-4.\n\t\t​NOTE: Make sure that in total, there are one auditory bouba word trial, one auditory bouba non-word sound trial, one auditory kiki word trial, and one auditory kiki non-word sound trial.",
    "2. Participants\nRecruit one group of participants who are congenitally blind; that is, blinded less than four months after birth20,21,22: Categories 5: total blindness; and 4: Light perception (perceiving a light source) and light projection (perceiving where a light source is situated)22. Make sure they are all braille readers.\nRecruit one group of fully sighted participants, at twice the size of the group of participants who are congenitally blind. Make sure they all have normal/corrected to normal vision.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that all participants are between 18 and 70 years of age, with normal/corrected to normal hearing, no cognitive delay or impairment, nor any physical disabilities, and that they are all naïve to the bouba/kiki-effect.\nRandomly assign half the group of the fully sighted participants to the blindfold-group and the other half to the vision-group.\n\tNOTE: Participants, type of tactile/visual bouba/kiki shape(s), type of auditory bouba/kiki, and congruousness are all randomly assigned to one of two categories: Blindfold or vision; filled or outlined; word or non-word sound; bouba or kiki; congruous or incongruous. Thus the random assignment can be done either by a computer program or manually (e.g., by tossing a coin).\n3. Materials\nProduce the tactile/visual materials\n\t\nTransfer the visual bouba/kiki shapes (30 x 23 mm) to swell paper, either by printing them from a personal computer or by photocopying then from a picture. Make sure to transfer two types of visual bouba/kiki shapes: One filled and one outlined [(1.5 pt. line). Cf. Figure 1].\nPass the swell paper through a heat fuser. Make sure the tactile bouba/kiki shapes rise to ~0.5 mm height. Alternatively, order the tactile/visual bouba/kiki shapes from a transcription service for people who are visually impaired (with a PDF file attached).\nGlue the swell paper onto foam board [white (5 mm thick)]. Use spray glue.",
    "Cut the swell paper and foam board into size (50 x 50 mm), that is, to create four separate tactile/visual picture cards: Bouba filled, bouba outlined, kiki filled, and kiki outlined (cf. Figure 1). Use a knife for cutting wallpaper.\nCut a carton plate/foam board for covering the tactile/visual bouba/kiki shapes into size (297 x 210 mm). Use a knife for cutting wallpaper. Alternatively, order the A4 format.\nCut copy paper/plastic embossing film into size (210 x 148 mm). Use a guillotine. Alternatively, order the A5 format.\nCut a rubber mat into size (230 x 150 mm). Use a knife or pair of scissors. Alternatively, order the Moon hand frame and take it apart to uncover the rubber mat.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59954/59954fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Two types of bouba/kiki shapes: Filled and outlined Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59954/59954fig1large.jpg]\nProduce the auditory materials\n\t\nRecord the spoken bouba (cf. Audio 1) and kiki words. Save in the MP3 format: One file for the bouba word and one for the kiki word.\nCreate the bouba and kiki non-word sounds, by mimicking the duration and frequency (i.e. melody) of the spoken words ‘bouba’ and ‘kiki.’ Use a sound wave generator and pitch bend. Save in the MP3 format: One file for the bouba sound (cf. Audio 2) and one for the kiki sound.\nInstall the VLC app for iOS on a smartphone. Transfer the MP3 files for bouba and kiki to the VLC app. Save them as four separate files: Bouba sound, bouba word, kiki sound, and kiki word.\nAudio 1: Bouba word Please click here to download this file.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59954/Audio_1.mp3]\nAudio 2: Bouba sound Please click here to download this file.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59954/Audio_2.mp3]\n4. Procedure and scoring\nSet up the test session",
    "Conduct the three experiments in a quiet room that is neutral in color, and with all participants individually. Ask the participants in the blindfold-group to put on their blindfold, before setting up the tactile/visual-auditory materials, and make sure they keep their blindfold on throughout and between all three experiments.\nSet up the tactile/visual materials\n\t\nPlace the rubber mat directly in front of the participant. Then, place (Experiment 1) the two tactile/visual bouba and kiki shapes (Experiment 2), the one tactile/visual bouba or kiki shape and (Experiment 3), the copy paper/plastic embossing film on top of the rubber mat.\n\t\tNOTE: In Experiment 1, make sure to always present bouba on the left and kiki on the right; and in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, to always present them in the same orientation (cf. Figure 1): To enhance the participants’ ability to form mental images of the bouba and kiki shapes without interference from their position and/or orientation on the rubber mat. Make sure not to inform the participants about this fixed presentation of the tactile/visual bouba and kiki shapes. In the vision-group, always set up the test material behind a carton plate/foam board, to prevent these participants from taking a sneak peek at what is in store.\nSet up the auditory materials\n\t\nPlace the MP3 player directly in front of the participant (on the other side of the rubber mat), with the loudspeaker closest to them.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not repeat back verbally the auditory information from the MP3 player: To prevent the participants in the vision-group from observing the lip movements on the bouba/kiki word-trials1, and thus keep under control across all experimental groups the amount and type of sensory information.\nConduct Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3",
    "Invite the participants who will be exploring and drawing the tactile shapes (i.e. the blind and blindfold-group) to explore the rubber mat (by touch): For example, for size and texture, without any of the tactile/visual picture cards and/or copy paper or plastic embossing film placed on top.\nConduct Experiment 1\n\t\nExplain that two picture cards will be presented on the rubber mat, each one picturing a tactile/visual shape. Then, explain that some audio will be played from the MP3 player and that this audio will correspond to one of the tactile/visual shapes.\n\t\t​NOTE: Do not inform the participants about the two types of tactile/visual bouba/kiki (filled and outlined) and the two types of auditory bouba/kiki (sound and word).\nPlace the two tactile/visual picture cards on the rubber mat (cf. Figure 1).\nIn the blind and blindfold-group, ask the participant to make a fist using both hands and to place their fists on top of the presented tactile/visual picture cards, guiding them if needed. Place the left hand on top of the participant’s fists.\nAsk the participant to explore the two tactile/visual shapes, the blind and blindfold-group by touch and the vision-group by vision, when the hand on top of their fists (blind and blindfold-group) / the carton plate or foam board (vision-group) is removed, and to say ‘yes’ when they have finished their exploring.\nRemove the left hand from the participant’s fists (in the blind and blindfold-group) / the carton plate or foam board (in the vision-group).\nAs soon as the participant says ‘yes,’ cover the tactile/visual picture cards.\nPlay the audio from the MP3 player.\n\t\t​NOTE: Play the auditory information from the MP3 player only once and do not repeat it back orally to the participants.",
    "Ask the participant to signal which tactile/visual shape they associate with the audio, for example, by saying ‘left/right,’ ‘curvy/angular’ or ‘flower/star’, and note the shape given. Do not respond to the participant’s answer.\nScore whether the participant’s answer is correct or incorrect.\n\t\t​NOTE: Repeat 4.5.2–4.5.9 for all eight trials.\nConduct Experiment 2\n\t\nExplain that one picture card, picturing a tactile/visual shape, will be presented on the rubber mat and that some audio will be played from the MP3 player. Then, explain that the audio will be played one time per picture card, as soon as the participant starts exploring the tactile/visual shape.\n\t\t​NOTE: Do not inform the participants about the two types of tactile/visual bouba/kiki (filled and outlined), the one type of auditory bouba/kiki (sound), and the two types of congruousness (congruous and incongruous).\nPlace the tactile/visual picture card on the rubber mat.\nIn the blind and blindfold-group, ask the participant to make a fist using both hands and to place their fists on top of the presented tactile/visual picture card, guiding them if needed. Place the left hand on top of the participant’s fists.\nAsk the participant to explore the tactile/visual shape, the blind and blindfold-group by touch and the vision-group by vision, when the hand on top of their fists (blind and blindfold-group) / the carton plate or foam board (vision-group) is removed, and to listen to the audio. Then, ask them to name the tactile/visual shape and the audio as either ‘bouba’ or ‘kiki’: One name only23,24,25, when they have finished their exploring.\nRemove the left hand from the participant’s fists (in the blind and blindfold-group) / the carton plate or foam board (in the vision-group) and play the audio from the MP3 player.",
    "​NOTE: Play the auditory information from the MP3 player only once and do not repeat it back orally to the participants.\nAs soon as the participant names the tactile/visual shape and the audio, cover the picture card and note the name given. Do not respond to the participant’s answer.\nScore whether the participant’s answer is correct or incorrect.\n\t\tNOTE: Repeat 4.6.2–4.6.7 for all eight trials.\nAcross the congruous and incongruous trials, count a participant as ‘correct’ when they have recognized ≥75% of the tactile/visual bouba and kiki shapes.\nConduct Experiment 3:\n\t\nExplain that some copy paper/plastic embossing film will be placed on top of the rubber mat, instead of the tactile/visual picture card(s), and that the participant will be asked to draw on it. In the blind and blindfold-group, invite the participant to try out the different drawing equipment and to decide for themselves which they prefer: The copy paper or plastic embossing film and rollerball pen or saddleback style. Next, explain that some audio will be played from the MP3 player and that the participant will be drawing the tactile/visual shape they associate with this audio, one shape per segment of audio when asked.\n\t\t​NOTE: Do not inform the participants about the auditory information (bouba and kiki), nor the two types of auditory bouba/kiki (sound and word).\nPlace the copy paper/plastic embossing film on the rubber mat.\nIn all three experimental groups (blind; blindfold; vision), ask the participant to make a fist using both hands while holding the rollerball pen/saddleback style and to place their fists on top of the copy paper/plastic embossing film, guiding them if needed. Place the left hand on top of the participant’s fists.",
    "Ask the participant to draw the shape that they associate with the presented audio when the hand on top of their fists is removed. In the blind and blindfold-group, ask the participant to draw a tactile shape; and in the vision-group, a visual shape. Ask the participant to say ‘yes’ when they have finished their drawing.\nRemove the left hand from the participant’s fists.\nPlay the audio from the MP3 player.\n\t\t​NOTE: Play the auditory information from the MP3 player only once and do not repeat it back orally to the participants.\nAs soon as the participant says ‘yes,’ remove their tactile/visual drawing from the rubber mat and label it in the bottom right corner with the correct trial number. Do not respond to or provide any comments on the participant’s answer/drawn shape.\n\t\t​NOTE: Repeat 4.7.2–4.7.7 for all four trials.\nScan all tactile/visual drawings (1:1 size) into the jpg format immediately after each test session.\n\t\t​NOTE: Experiment 3 is scored by a group of scorers after all drawing data have been collected.\nProduce a questionnaire for scoring the drawing data (cf. Figure 2):\n\t\t\nScale down all scanned drawings to include 12 pictures per page in the landscape A4 format.\nRandomly assign bouba/kiki trials, sound/word trials, and blind/blindfold/vision drawers.\nAdd trial number in the upper left corner of each picture.\nAdd ‘bouba’ and ‘kiki,’ and ‘blind,’ ‘blindfolded’ and ‘sighted’ under each picture.\nRecruit a group scorer, above 18 years of age; with normal/corrected to normal hearing and vision; with no cognitive delay or impairment, nor any physical disabilities; that are all naïve to this study, and that show a visual shape-printed word bouba/kiki-effect.\nAsk the scorers to answer two multiple-choice questions per picture in the questionnaire:",
    "​(1) ‘Is the pictured shape “bouba” or “kiki;”’ and (2) ‘Is the pictured shape drawn by someone who is blind (since birth), blindfolded, or fully sighted?’17.\nDepending on the number of pictures in the questionnaire, ask half of the group of scorers to score half the questionnaire, and the other half to score the rest.\nFor each trial, count ‘correspond,’ ‘not correspond,’ and ‘inconclusive,’ that is:\n\t\t\n‘Correspond’ when (i) ≥75% of the scorers agreed on which tactile/visual shape (bouba or kiki) was pictured, and (ii) this shape corresponded to the presented auditory bouba/kiki in this trial.\n‘Not correspond’ when (i) ≥75% of the scorers agreed on which tactile/visual shape (bouba or kiki) was pictured, and (ii) this shape did not correspond to the presented auditory bouba/kiki in this trial.\n‘Inconclusive’ when <75% of the scorers agreed on which tactile/visual shape (bouba or kiki) was pictured. Remove the ‘inconclusive’ pictures/participant drawings from the statistical analyses.\nAcross trials, count a participant as ‘correspond’ when ≥75% of their drawn mental images: That is, that tactile/visual shapes correspond to the presented auditory bouba/kiki.\nFor each trial, count ‘recognized,’ ‘not recognized,’ and ‘inconclusive,’ that is:\n\t\t\n‘Recognized’ when (i) ≥66.6% of the scorers agreed on which experimental group (blind, blindfold or vision) had drawn the pictured shape, and (ii) this was correct in this trial.\n‘Not recognized’ when (i) ≥66.6% of the scorers agreed on which experimental group (blind, blindfold or vision) had drawn the pictured shape, and (ii) this was not correct in this trial.\n‘Inconclusive’ when <66.6% of the scorers agreed on which experimental group (blind, blindfold or vision) had drawn the pictured shape. Exclude the ‘inconclusive’ participant recognitions from the statistical analyses.\nAcross trials (and with ‘inconclusive’ participant recognitions removed), count a participant as ‘recognized’ when recognized in ≥75% of all trials.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59954/59954fig2v2.jpg",
