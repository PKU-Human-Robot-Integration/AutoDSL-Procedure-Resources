    "All animal procedures were approved and followed the animal care guidelines of the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC#16-03019).\n1. Preparing the Equipment for the Microinjection\nPreparing the injection plate.\nPrepare a 50 mL solution of 1.2% agarose dissolved in egg water (0.6 g/L aquarium salt in reverse osmosis water + 0.01 mg/L methylene blue). Boil the solution until the agarose dissolves and then supplement by adding 0.05 mg/L methylene blue. Pour 25 mL of the final solution into a 10 cm Petri dish and allow it to solidify. Place the remaining 25 mL of agarose solution in a 42 °C water bath until ready for step 1.1.2.\nSet a 2 inch diameter beaker in the center of the solidified surface and pour the remaining 25 mL of 1.2% agarose.\n\t\tNOTE: This creates an injection surface on the periphery of the plate and a core in the center, which provides an area to test needle size and tumor suspension consistency.\n\t\t\nMaintain the injection plate at 28 °C for at least 30 min prior to injection or at 4 °C for long-term storage.\nPreparing injection needles.\nMake the needles by pulling 10 cm capillaries with an outer dimension of 1.2 mm and an inner dimension of 0.9 mm (without a filament) into two needles on a needle puller.\n\t\tNOTE: Each needle should measure 6 cm in total length, where approximately 1.5 cm of the end is tapered.\nCarefully place the needle on a microscope slide wrapped in plastic paraffin film. Use a razor blade to cut the end of the needle at a 45° angle to create a needle with an opening at the tip.",
    "NOTE: Typically, 0.1 mm to 0.3 mm of the end of the needle is removed. A beveled tip is not required to perform the injections.\nPrepare the microinjection setup.\n\t\nArrange a standard microinjection setup, including a stereomicroscope, a manipulator, and a microinjector for the transplantation.\n2. Preparing Embryos for Transplantation\nCollect up to 500 mitfa w2 embryos44 (or embryos of any other zebrafish genotypes as defined by the user) as described45 and maintain in a 28 °C incubator.\nDechorionate the embryos at 24 hpf by adding 100 µL of 10 mg/mL protease cocktail solution diluted in egg water and gently rock for approximately 20 min. Rinse the embryos 3 times with fresh egg water to remove the residual protease.\nScreen the embryos at 48 hpf for the appropriate developmental stage, as defined by standard staging series criteria45.\n\tNote: Only correctly staged and morphologically normal embryos should be used for the transplantation.\nAnesthetize approximately twenty 48-hpf embryos in egg water containing 0.002% Tricaine-S in a petri dish. Confirm proper anesthesia by observing the cessation of movement.\n3. Making a Tumor Cell Suspension\nNOTE: Zebrafish brain tumor models can be generated by genetically engineering combinations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes17,46,47. Here, the sox10 promoter-driven NRASWT, p53zdf1/zdf1 CNS-PNET zebrafish model was used, as recently described17.\nEuthanize a brain tumor-bearing fish whose tumor burden is approximately 20% of the total body size using a 0.4% Tricaine-S overdose followed by immersion in ice water according to IACUC-approved protocols.\nDissect the fluorescently labeled tumor with a razor blade and tweezers under a fluorescence microscope using sterile technique and place it in 5 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).",
    "NOTE: Exact dissection methods will be user-defined and dependent on tumor type and tissue location. See the listed references for detailed procedures for the dissection of different zebrafish organs and brain tumors17,48.\nManually disrupt the tumor mass using a p1000 pipette until a uniform, cloudy solution develops. Remove large particulates with a pipette tip or using a 40 µm cell strainer (this is tumor-dependent). Centrifuge the suspension at room temperature for 5 min at 290 x g and remove the supernatant.\n\tNote: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is not performed to isolate tumor cells. This allows for the transplantation of a heterogeneous population of stromal, immune, and tumor cells.\nResuspend the tumor cell pellet in 100 µL of sterile PBS and transfer it to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Take 5 µL of the cell suspension and dilute it in 250 µL of PBS. Count the number of cells using a hemocytometer. Centrifuge the suspension for 3 min at 290 x g, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in sterile PBS to obtain the desired cell concentration.\n\tNOTE: Typically, cells resuspended in 30-40 µL of sterile PBS yield a solution that is viscous and opaque (cell concentration ≥100 cells/nL) and tend to generate the most successful transplants. Cell viability is not assessed.\nStore the tumor suspension on a 28 °C heat block during the transplantation procedure.\n4. Injecting the Tumor Suspension into the Fourth Ventricle of a 2-dpf Embryo\nTransfer 10-20 anesthetized embryos (from step 2.4) to the periphery of the injection plate using a transfer pipette; the embryos should fall laterally onto the injection plate, with the ventricles clearly visible and accessible. Use an angled probe to adjust the embryos as needed and position them away from the outer edge of the injection plate.",
    "Load 1-2 µL of the tumor cell suspension into the injection needle using gel loading pipette tips and insert the needle into the manipulator.\nManually lower the manipulator, holding the needle at a 45° angle. Adjust the knobs on the micromanipulator in the x, y, and z directions until the needle is just above and approximately 5 mm to the right of the embryo head. Look through the eyepieces of the stereomicroscope and slowly adjust the micromanipulator in the x-direction until the needle pierces the fourth ventricle of the embryo. Do not allow the needle to pierce the heart or the yolk.\nPush the foot pedal attached to the microinjector to inject the tumor cell suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: The injection pressure and time will vary based on needle bore size, but a good starting point is 5 - 10 PSI and 50 - 100 ms. The volume of injected tumor cells can be assessed with standard oil drop techniques through injection into mineral oil, if desired49. Injections of 500 pL with a drop diameter of 0.1 mm typically give the best results.\nGently rinse the injected embryos off the injection plate and into a petri dish using fresh egg water. Maintain the embryos in egg water for the remaining procedures or until they are grown in tanks (as described in step 4.9.1).\nInspect the injected embryos under a fluorescence stereomicroscope. Confirm that the injection pressure, angle, needle size, and cell suspension viscosity result in tumor cells filling 25-50% of the ventricle space. Adjust these parameters as necessary.\nRepeat steps 4.1-4.5 for any remaining embryos. Anesthetize the additional embryos as needed (described in step 2.4).\n\tNOTE: An experienced user can inject up to 300 embryos over 3-4 h.\nPlace the embryos back in the 28 °C incubator overnight.",
    "The next day, assess embryo survival by examining morphological and physiological features, such as normal heart and brain development, as described45.\nFor screening, anesthetize the embryos, as described in step 2.4, at 1 day post-transplant (dpt).\n\t\nUse a transfer pipette to add 4% methylcellulose onto the middle of a petri dish and add the embryos to the methylcellulose drop. Orient the embryos (ventral side facing the light source) using an angled probe and screen for a consistent engraftment size using a fluorescence microscope. Remove any embryos with tumor cells not confined to the ventricle or those that contain tumor cells emcompassing less than 25% of the ventricle space.\n\t\tNote: Consistent engraftment is defined as embryos with a single tumor mass that encompasses 25-50% of the ventricle space17. For screening purposes, use a fluorescence stereomicroscope with a 1X objective, a 0.15 numerical aperture, a magnification ranging from 0.7-1.6X, and an exposure time of 50 ms to 1 s. For all images, utilize the bright-field channel in addition to either the GFP or RFP channel.\nFor maintenance of tumors, place the transplanted embryos in tanks to grow45 at 8 dpf (6 dpt).\n5. Imaging Transplanted Embryos for Cellular Behaviors\nAnesthetize the embryos at 3-8 dpf (1-6 dpt) and mount (dorsal side facing the coverslip) in 1.2% low-melt agarose. Perform time-lapse imaging of the mounted embryos using a laser-scanning confocal microscope for the desired length of time to visualize cellular behaviors, such as migration, cell division, or cell-cell interactions, as needed38,43,53.",
    "NOTE: Use an aspect ratio of 1,024 x 1,024, a scan speed of 8 µs/pixel. Employ scan averaging and define the z-depth dimensions to ensure the capture of the entire tumor mass (1,000-1,500 µm). Additionally, perform 4-h time-lapse experiments, acquiring an image every 10-15 min using a 40x objective, to monitor invasive behaviors. The detector sensitivity will vary depending upon the intensity of the tumor mass, and the laser power will be microscope-dependent, but it is generally recommended to be between 15 and 40%.\nOnce the imaging is complete, free the mounted embryo from the agarose using an angled probe and transfer it to a petri dish with fresh egg water.\n6. Drug Administration to Transplanted Embryos and the Assessment of Tumor Burden17\nAnesthetize embryos at 3 dpf and orient them in 4% methylcellulose, with the ventral side facing the light source. Image the pre-treatment embryos using a fluorescence microscope17.\nPlace the transplanted embryos at 3 dpf in a 12-well plate, with 10 embryos per well in 0.5 mL of egg water. Add the appropriate amount of drug to obtain the desired final concentration (e.g., 50 µM MEK inhibitor) and return the embryos to a 28 °C incubator. The next day, remove the drug-treated egg water with a thin-bore transfer pipette and add fresh treatment. Repeat this daily until the embryos reach 8 dpf.\nAt 8 dpf, remove the embryos from drug treatment and place them in fresh egg water. Anesthetize the embryos and orient (ventral side facing the light source) in 4% methylcellulose. Image embryos post-treatment using a fluorescence microscope. Quantify the tumor area using appropriate software, as described17.",
    "Separate the embryos as appropriate per treatment and place them in tanks to grow. After 4-9 weeks, anesthetize the fish and assess them for overall tumor burden using a standard fluorescence stereomicroscope, as described17."
