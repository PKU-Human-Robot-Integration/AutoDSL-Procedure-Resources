  "procedures": [
    "All studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA) and conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.\n1. Fixation by Vascular Perfusion\nNOTE: A general description of the method for rat brain vascular perfusion has been already detailed in this journal13 and is beyond the scope of this protocol. However, the following steps are specific for the preparation of newborn rat brain tissue to obtain high-quality electron micrographs for quantitative analysis of synaptic vesicles distribution at pre-synaptic terminals.\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde\nPlace 800 mL of 0.1 M Phosphate Buffer (PB) in a 2 L glass beaker on a stirring plate under a fume-hood. Heat to approximately 60 °C without boiling the buffer.\nAdd 40 g of paraformaldehyde powder. Stir continuously\nWhile measuring pH, add small drops of 10 N NaOH until the solution clears. Final pH should be 7.2-7.4.\nAdd remaining 0.1 M PB to a final volume of 1 L. Let cool, filter with a 0.45 μm membrane and store at 4 °C overnight.\nNOTE: Prepare fresh paraformaldehyde the day before perfusion.\nCAUTION: Inhalation of aldehyde vapors can cause nasal symptoms and airway irritation. Contact with skin causes dermatitis. Aldehydes should be handled in a fume-hood while wearing gloves, a protective gown and safety goggles\nPrepare Tyrode solution\nPlace 1 L of distilled water in a glass beaker on a stirring plate. Add NaCl (8 g), KCl (0.15 g), CaCl2 (0.1 g), MgCl2 (0.006 g), NaH2PO4 (0.055 g), NaHCO3 (1 g) and dextrose (1 g) in the beaker.\nStir continuously and measure pH. Keep pH between 7.2 and 7.4.\nNOTE: Tyrode solution is also commercially available.",
    "Mix 4% paraformaldehyde with glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 2%. Add 40 mL of electron microscopy-grade 50% glutaraldehyde to 1 L of 4% paraformaldehyde. Mix well in a stirring plate\nNOTE: Approximately 100 mL of the paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde fixative solution is needed to perfuse the body of a newborn rat. Therefore, at least 10 newborn rats can be perfused with 1 L of fixative. Do not mix paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde until immediately before use. Bring all solutions to room temperature before perfusion.\nOnce access to the left ventricle has been gained (see whole animal perfusion protocol13), flush the vascular system with Tyrode solution for 30 s at a perfusion pressure of 120 mmHg.\nNOTE: The success of the perfusion depends in part on the complete exclusion of blood from the vascular bed\nFlush with paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde solution at the same pressure for 10 min.\nNOTE: Maintenance of constant perfusion pressure is essential to avoid introduction of artifacts. In addition, the temperature of the perfusate should not be below the rat’s body temperature to avoid vasoconstriction\nRemove the fixed brain from the skull and place in fresh paraformaldehyde-glutaraldehyde fixative at 4 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Brain Slicing\nEmbed the fixed brain in 4% agarose and glue the brain-agarose block on a vibratome stage\nNOTE: Other laboratories have obtained good quality sections by achieving a stable block on the vibratome without agar support\nSection slices of 50 μm thickness. Set the microtome to low frequency and speed.\nNOTE: Sections can be stored in 0.1 M PB with 0.05% sodium azide at 4 °C for several years.\nPlace the sections in 0.1 M PB in a Petri dish, examine the sections under a dissection microscope and select specimens for embedding\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.",
    "3. Rinsing\nNOTE: It is important to rinse the specimen after fixation with aldehydes and before post-fixation with osmium, since residual fixatives may produce osmium precipitates\nPipette 0.1 M PB into a short, wide-mouth glass vial with cap. Place one specimen per each vial. Fully cover the specimen so that it does not dry.\nNOTE: Keep specimens in the same vial from this step through all the solution changes of fixation, dehydration and infiltration, until they are ready for flat embedding.\nRinse the specimen in 0.1 M PB for 3 min x 2, then remove PB with a micropipette.\nNOTE: Since the brain of the newborn rat is profoundly sensitive to changes in osmolarity12,35,36,37, carry out the washings in the same vehicle as that used in the fixative mixture\n4. Post-fixation with Osmium\nPreparation of osmium tetroxide (OsO4)\nNOTE: This Author’s lab utilizes OsO4 4% supplied in an aqueous solution in glass ampoules (5 mL of OsO4 4% in H2O). Other labs have used OsO4 crystals successfully. However, several hours are necessary to dissolve OsO4 crystals in a vehicle.\n\t\nTake 5 mL (one ampoule) of 4% OsO4/H2O, open it and place it in a brown glass bottle\nNOTE: OsO4 is a strong oxidizing agent and readily reduced by exposure to light. Reduction can be avoided during preparation by placing OsO4 in a brown glass bottle\nAdd 5 mL of 0.2 M PB. This will yield 10 mL of 2% OsO4/0.1 M PB.\nNOTE: Since the brain of the newborn rat is profoundly sensitive to changes in osmolarity, use the same buffer to prepare aldehyde fixatives and OsO4 solution12,35,36,37\nAdd additional 10 mL of 0.1 M PB. This will yield a final solution of 20 mL of 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m PB.",
    "Use a 20 mL syringe fitted with a long needle to draw 1% OsO4 and place it in a brown glass bottle or a scint vial covered with aluminum foil.\nCAUTION: OsO4 is extremely volatile and its fumes are toxic to nose, eyes and throat. All work should be performed in a fume-hood using gloves and protective clothing, and no body part should be exposed to OsO4. Handling and waste disposal should be done according to your institution’s guidelines. Store the unused OsO4 in a tightly stoppered brown glass bottle with Teflon liner on the glass stopper, wrap the bottle in double aluminum foil and store in a dessicator. In the presence of leaking fumes, OsO4 can discolor internal surfaces and contents of the refrigerator. Under the above mentioned storage conditions the OsO4 solution is stable for several months. When solutions get oxidized during storage, they turn gray, in which case they need to be disposed of.\nAdd 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M PB in the specimen vial and let sit for 1 h. Extract OsO4 after 1 h with a micropipette.\nNOTE: Before applying OsO4 to the section, it is critical to unfold and flatten the specimen. Avoid application directly on top of the specimen, instead use the vial’s walls to gently drip OsO4 to the bottom of the vial. The specimen becomes brown and rigid shortly after OsO4 application. Handle gently from now on to avoid tissue damage\n5. Rinsing\nNOTE: It is important to rinse the specimen after post-fixation with OsO4 and before dehydration, since residual fixatives may react with dehydration agents37.\nRinse with 0.1 M PB for 3 min x 3.",
    "NOTE: Since the brain of the newborn rat is profoundly sensitive to changes in osmolarity, carry out the washings in the same vehicle as that used in the fixative mixture12,35,36,37.\nPlace the osmium solution and first two PB rinses into OsO4 waste and dispose of it according to your institution’s guidelines.\n6. Sequential Dehydration and Staining with Uranyl Acetate\nNOTE: This author’s laboratory uses water-immiscible epoxy resins for embedding. When epoxy resins are used, all specimen’s free water must be replaced with an organic solvent before infiltration by the embedding medium. Water is removed by passing the specimen through a series of solutions of ascending concentrations of ethanol and acetone12.\nPreparation of uranyl acetate (UA) \nPlace a 200 mL volumetric glass flask containing 100 mL of EtOH 70% on a stirring plate.\nAdd 4 g of UA to the flask. Wrap in aluminum foil (UA precipitates when exposed to light) and stir continuously.\nNOTE: UA dissolves slowly and incompletely in 70% EtOH. Allow undissolved crystals to settle down before using the solution. UA solution should be filtered with a 0.45 μm filter before use. UA can be prepared ahead of time and kept in a brown bottle wrapped in aluminum foil at 4 °C for months.\nCAUTION: UA is mildly radioactive and highly toxic. The inhalation of UA powder can cause upper respiratory tract disorders and disease of the lungs, liver and kidneys. UA is dangerous when ingested or when it comes in direct contact with skin and mucous membranes. All work should be performed in a fume-hood using gloves and protective clothing. Handling and waste disposal should be done according to your institution’s guidelines.\nDehydrate in 50% EtOH for 1 min. Remove 50% EtOH before adding UA.",
    "Add 4% UA in 70% EtOH. Let sit for 1 h or overnight. If overnight, place in the refrigerator at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Cap vial to avoid EtOH evaporation and cover with aluminum foil to avoid exposure to light. The protocol can be paused here.\n\t\nDispose of UA waste and the two following rinses according to your institution’s guidelines\nDehydrate in 70% EtOH for 1 min.\nDehydrate in 90% EtOH for 5 min.\nDehydrate in 100% EtOH for 5 min x 2.\nRinse the specimen in acetone for 2 min x 3.\n7. Infiltration and Embedding\nNOTE: Tissues are not sufficiently rigid to be cut into thin sections without the additional support of a resin matrix. Therefore, infiltration and embedding must precede sectioning12.\nPreparation of EPON resin\nUse a 60 mL gavage syringe. Remove the syringe plunger and cap the syringe with a safety needle.\nPlace the syringe with the open side up and add the volume of each ingredient of the resin mix incrementally. Add 22 mL of Embed-812 (resin). Add DDSA (hardener) to a total volume of 37 mL. Add NMA (hardener) to a total volume of 50.5 mL. Add 525 μL of DMP-30 (accelerator) with a pipette. Move the plunger of the pipette very slowly as DMP is very viscous.\nNOTE: it is important to add the embedding reagents in the order listed. The accelerator (DMP-30) must be added last. To obtain a cured block that has the desired characteristics, it is critical to use the exact amount of the hardener and the accelerator. Freshly prepared embedding mixtures are preferred.\nPut the plunger back and place the syringe on a rocker with continuous shaking for at least 30 min. Color will change from yellow to amber.",
    "NOTE: All ingredients must be mixed very thoroughly. Failure to do so results in uneven impregnation of the tissue specimen and a block of uneven hardness\nMix 1 volume of EPON resin with 1 volume of acetone in a scint vial and shake to mix. Apply the 1:1 EPON:acetone mixture on the tissue after removing the last acetone rinse. Keep covered to avoid acetone evaporation. Remove the 1:1 mixture of resin and acetone after 2-4 h or keep overnight.\nNOTE: the protocol can be paused here.\nReplace the mixture of resin and acetone with full resin. Let sit for 4 h or overnight. Put all EPON waste in a collection container under the hood to be polymerized and disposed of later.\nNOTE: the protocol can be paused here.\n8. Flat-embedding\nNOTE: Specimens are flat-embedded between two aclar films in a sandwich-like fashion.\nCut two rectangular pieces of clear aclar sheet. Wipe the films clean with EtOH 70%. Trim the sheets so that there is at least 1.5 cm of tissue-free plastic on every side of the section. The aclar sheet on top should have the same width as the bottom, and its height should be approximately two thirds of the bottom sheet.\nSlowly tilt the vial with the specimen and gently lift the tissue from the bottom of the vial.\nUse a micro flexible spatula and a fine brush to carefully move the section along the vial walls and transfer onto the aclar sheet.\nNOTE: Handle sections with caution to avoid specimen damage.\nGently place the aclar sheet on top of the specimen.\nNOTE: Make sure there is enough resin between the two sheets to seal the sandwich\nGently push out any trapped air bubbles without exerting direct pressure onto the section. Wipe out the excess EPON.",
    "NOTE: The elimination of air bubbles is important, as their presence makes visualization of the specimen difficult and weakens the stability of the resin bonds.\nLabel the sheets with a solvent resistant pen and place in oven at 60 ͦC for 2-3 days to polymerize.\nNOTE: the protocol can be paused here.\n9. Capsule Embedding\nNOTE: Ultramicrotomes are supplied with chucks to hold cylindrical blocks obtained from embedding specimens in capsules. Cylindrical blocks have the ideal geometry to be least affected by vibrations arising during sectioning.\nGently open the sandwiched aclar films. The specimen will adhere to one of the two aclar sheets.\nUse a solvent resistant pen to mark the side of the aclar sheet that contains the section. Mark near the tissue.\nNOTE: It is critical to perform this step before punching out the tissue of interest.\nUse a disc punch to obtain a circle sample of the section. The pen mark should be part of the punched out tissue.\nPrepare the cap of an embedding capsule side up on a capsule holder. Place a drop of resin on the cap.\nPlace the punched disc inside the cap with the tissue section facing up. The pen mark will gleam when light is shined on the specimen.\nInsert a capsule into the cap and use fine tweezers to insert labeling. Roll and lower a printed 2 cm-long piece of paper into the capsule. Make the label to fit to the curvature of the side walls of the capsule. Wait for polymerization to be complete, so that the label becomes permanently embedded in the resin.\nPour the embedding resin inside the capsule and fill until the edge of the capsule.",
    "Push the tissue specimen down to the bottom of the capsule with the aid of a pointed wooden stick and place in the oven at 60 °C for 2-3 days.\nNOTE: Take care not to press the tissue too hard, instead let it lie loosely so that a thin layer of the embedding medium is present between the tissue and the capsule surface. The protocol can be paused here.\n10. Trimming of Block Face\nNOTE: Small size and appropriate shape of the block face are prerequisites for satisfactory sectioning. Therefore, trimming of the specimen block is a necessity.\nUse a sharp one-edge razor blade. Clean with acetone immediately before use.\nMount the capsule block in a block holder and place the block holder on the stage of a stereomicroscope.\nNOTE: The trimming procedure should be carried out under microscope binoculars and oblique illumination.\nRemove the aclar sheet from the tip of the capsule using a razor blade. The aclar sheet appears as a shiny layer under the light of the dissecting scope.\nHold the razor blade at an angle of 45 degrees and make cuts down four sides of the capsule block.\nNOTE: Better control of the trimming is achieved if the blade is held with both hands.\nMake short cuts so that the block takes the form of a short pyramid with wall angles of approximately 45°.\nNOTE: The specimen face is supported much better if the sides leading to it are kept short. If the block tip is too thin and long, it will vibrate during thin sectioning. Ideally, the area of interest should be centered in the block face.\nTrim the tip of the capsule to discard superfluous tissue and only preserve the area of interest.",
    "NOTE: No part of the section should be without tissue, as variations in the density of the block face are a major cause of difficulty in sectioning. Ideally, the surface area of the capsule face should be no more than 1 mm2.\nTrim the capsule face in the shape of a scalene trapezoid. Because in a scalene trapezoid no side is equal, this shape is best to orient the area of interest relative to the rest of the specimen.\nNOTE: During sectioning, the trapezoid-shaped face is supported much better than that of any other shape.\n11. Microtome Sectioning\nNOTE: The majority of biological specimens are too thick in their natural state to be penetrated by an electron beam. Therefore, the material must be cut in thin sections that can be penetrated by the electron beam.\nCut thin sections (silver interference color, 600-900 Å) on a ultramicrotome at planes parallel to the surface.\nPlace the sections on grids. This author’s lab uses copper grids of 3.05 mm in outer diameter.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n12. Post-staining with Uranyl Acetate\nPrepare 2% UA in distilled water. Place a 200 mL volumetric glass flask containing 100 mL of distilled water on a stirring plate. Add 2 g of UA to the flask. Wrap in aluminum foil (UA precipitates when exposed to light) and stir continuously.\nNOTE: For details of UA preparation, see section 6 of this protocol.\nPlace several individual drops of 2% UA on a clean sheet of dental wax in a Petri dish.\nFloat the grid with the specimen (section side down) on a drop of UA for 25 min.\nNOTE: Float each grid on a separate drop of UA.",
    "Hold the grid at its edge with forceps and rinse twice under a gentle jet of boiled distilled water at room temperature from a plastic wash bottle.\nNOTE: Do not allow the grid to dry before staining with lead.\n13. Post-staining with Lead\nPrepare a CO2-free chamber (CO2 in the air is the primary source of lead precipitation). Place a piece of filter paper soaked with 1 N NaOH in a Petri dish. Place a small sheet of clean dental wax on top of the filter paper and place several NaOH pellets on one side of the dish. Cover the dish.\nNOTE: Prepare this setup before the grids are stained with UA, so that the atmosphere in the chamber is free of CO2 and ready for lead staining by the time UA staining is complete.\nMake 4% NaOH. Add 0.2 g of NaOH to 5 mL of distilled water.\nPrepare Sato’s triple lead solution. To prepare 10 mL, add 0.1 g of lead nitrate, 0.1 g of lead citrate, 0.1 g of lead acetate and 0.2 g of sodium citrate into a glass bottle. Add 8.2 mL of distilled water and shake vigorously for 5 min. Sonicate for 30 s, then add 1.8 mL of freshly made 4% NaOH.\nPlace several drops of Sato’s lead on the wax in the Petri dish.\nPlace the grid stained with UA (section side down) on the drop of lead.\nNOTE: Each grid should be floated on a separate drop of lead. Each drop should be small enough to allow the grid to float on top of the dome of the drop instead of sliding down on the sides.\nCover the dish and let stain for 5 min.",
    "Hold the grid at its edge with forceps and wash thoroughly under a gentle jet of boiled distilled water at room temperature from a plastic wash bottle.\nBlot dry the grid on filter paper and store the grid.\nNOTE: Make sure the section does not come in direct contact with the filter paper.\nSubscription Required.
