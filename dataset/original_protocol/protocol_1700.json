    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSubcutaneous administration of insulin and amyloidoma formation\nTiming: 10 min, 28 days\nHere, insulin fibril is injected subcutaneously to generate amyloidoma.\nThis section is shown in Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nLocate a spot and insert the needle subcutaneously.\nGently and slowly inject insulin (fibrillated) and insulin with IS1 (non-fibrillated) on the contralateral sides of the vertebrae. The area where insulin is administered will bloat which will gradually dissipate with time.\nRepeat the injection once daily for 28 consecutive days at the same injection site until the visual appearance of skin amyloidoma (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1285-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Visualization of subcutaneous amyloid mass deposition after injections for twenty-eight consecutive days\n(A) The emergence of subcutaneous amyloid mass (black arrow) at the site of insulin fibril administration, while no substantial amyloid mass was visible (red arrow) at the site of Insulin-IS1 complex administration.\n(B) Zoomed view of mice exhibiting amyloid mass for insulin fibril (black arrow) and insulin-IS1 complex (red arrow).\nScale bar 1 cm.\nNote: Insulin is readily soluble in acidic pH. Hence, insulin is first dissolved in a low volume of citrate phosphate buffer (pH-2.6).\nNote: The pH of the subcutaneous region is around 7.4. Therefore, before administration of insulin in mice, it is to be diluted to the required amount in PBS (pH-7.4) since the administration of acidic insulin in mice can cause lesions on mice skin since citrate is a strong ion, resulting in acidosis in the administered subcutaneous area. (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1])\nNote: The insulin needs to be administered subcutaneously at the same site for better amyloid formation (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).",
    "Critical: After the administration of insulin, monitor the mice to check whether it has undergone a hypoglycemic shock. To check, prick the mouse tail with a needle to obtain blood and check the blood glucose level using a glucometer (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]). In case of hypoglycemia, inject 100 μL of 20% glucose intraperitoneally and check whether the blood glucose level has recovered to a normoglycemic state, else, inject more glucose.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Subcutaneous administration of insulin preparations on the contralateral side of mice at a fixed site, related to step 1–2\nExcision of amyloidoma\nTiming: 15 min\nThis section is shown in Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].\nSacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation.\nUsing scissors, carefully excise the amyloidoma along with the surrounding tissue (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1285-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

No amyloid formation (bottom) in Insulin-IS1 Complex.\nScale bar 3.3 mm.\nWeigh the mass of the skin biopsy and note it down (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1285_7.csv\nStore the tissue in 10% formalin.\nCritical: Be careful to locate the position of the amyloidoma and cut the skin surrounding the amyloidoma along with it.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Excision of skin biopsies after 28 days of consecutive administration of insulin preparations, related to step 5\nFixing and sectioning tissue\nTiming: 1 day\nHere, fixed skin biopsies are embedded in paraffin, cut into tissue sections and mounted on slides.\nDehydrate the tissue by immersing the tissues at room temperature (20°C–25°C) according to Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1285_8.csv",
    "Carefully immerse the tissue in paraffin at 58°C.\nUsing a rotary microtome, cut tissues 10μm thick.\nNote: The tissues should be around 10 μm thick for optimal Congo Red staining (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nFloat the sections in a 56°C water bath.\nMount the sections onto slides and dry them overnight at room temperature.\nCongo red staining\nHere, amyloid fibrils are detected using Congo red dye. Congo red is a metachromatic stain that is commonly used for the detection of amyloids. This dye forms a hydrogen bridge bond with the carbohydrate part of the substrate and is capable of depositing itself on amyloid fibrils. The tissue appears orange-red upon Congo Red staining under a light microscope; however, under polarized light amyloid mass is observed as apple-green birefringence against a dark background.\nDeparaffinizing the tissue section\nTiming: 50 min\nDry heat the slides at 85°C for 15–20 min to dissolve wax.\nDeparaffinize the slides by immersing them into Coplin jars containing xylene for 2 min. Repeat the process two more times at room temperature.\nRehydrate the slides by serially immersing them in a gradient of alcohol at room temperature according to Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1285_9.csv\nWash the slides by dipping them in tap water for about 2 min.\nNote: The tissue needs to be properly deparaffinized for optimal staining. After the deparaffinization step, check whether the wax has been completely removed (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nStaining\nTiming: 50 min\nImmerse the slides in a Coplin jar containing Congo Red Solution and incubate for 15–20 min at room temperature.\nRinse the slides in distilled water following which quickly differentiate by dipping the slides in alkaline alcohol solution (5–10 dips).\nNote: Alkaline alcohol solution facilitates selective staining of amyloid and increases the intensity of staining.\nRinse the slides in tap water.",
    "Dehydrate the slides by immersing them in a Coplin jar containing 90% alcohol for 3 min followed by two changes of 100% alcohol for 3 min each at room temperature.\nClear the slides by immersing them in 2 changes of xylene for 3 min each at room temperature.\nMount the slides with DPX.\nPolarized light microscopy\nTiming: 5 min\nObserve the slides with a polarized light microscope."
