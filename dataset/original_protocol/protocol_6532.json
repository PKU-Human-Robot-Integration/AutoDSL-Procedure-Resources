    "Sample collectionSelect mice in similar growth status at 6-8 weeks.Collect fecal samples from 12 mice, approximately 300 mg per sample (stored at -20 °C). Used for the determination of SCFAs and recovery.Mix 12 samples fully, weigh about 100 mg of the mixed sample and place it in a 5 ml centrifuge tube. Repeat the weighing of the 22 samples. Use three of them to test SCFAs in parallel, and use the remaining 19 to determine the rate of recovery. Number and record the sample quality (stored at -20 °C).Sample pretreatmentKeep all biological samples frozen at -20 °C until the day of analysis.Add 3 ml HCl 1 M to each sample, vortex for 1 min, mix thoroughly until no obvious clumping.Place the well-mixed centrifuge tube in an ice-water bath in the beaker, and conduct ultrasonic extraction for 10 min (see Video 1). Set the temperature to room temperature and the frequency is 40k Hz.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Ice water bath Centrifuge the sample at 4 °C, 9,710 x g for 15 min.Use a pipette to transfer 1 ml of supernatant into a 5 ml centrifuge tube (see Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200702/20200702021120_8722.jpgFigure 1. Absorb the supernatantAdd 1 ml of ethyl acetate to the supernatant, invert the centrifuge tube to completely mix the supernatant (see Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Extraction Centrifuge the sample at 4 °C, 9,710 x g for 15 min.Aspirate the supernatant with disposable sterile syringe and filter through a 0.22 μm organic filter membrane. Transfer the filtered supernatant to Clear short thread wide mouth sample bottle, and inject into GC for analysis (If the sample stored in the bottle cannot be analyzed as soon as possible, it can be stored at -20 °C for 1-2 days) (see Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200702/20200702022239_1472.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and filterGas Chromatography (GC) experimental conditions Set the GC program according to conditions mentioned in Table 1. Table 1.

The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the standard SCFA was obtained according to the analysis of the GC workstation software.RecoveryCalculation of recovery rate by standard addition recovery method (Park et al., 2018).Take 19 samples from the \"A. Sample collection\" for testing recovery.Use 18 samples as parallel experiment and the other as a blank control without any treatment.",
    "Six samples as a group，add 1 ml of SCFAs standard solution of level 1 in Table 2. Select six samples as a group again and add 1 ml of SCFAs standard solution of level 3 in Table 2. Then select 6 samples as a group and add 1 ml of SCFAs standard solution of grade 5 in Table 2. The purpose is to check the accuracy of recovery.Treat the 19 samples in accordance with the sample pretreatment (Procedure B).Analyze the processed samples according to GC experimental conditions.Obtain the content of SCFAs according to the standard curve of SCFAs. Sample analysis      The 3 samples were analyzed according to the GC analysis method, and the SCFAs content in the samples could be obtained according to the standard       curves of various SCFAs."
