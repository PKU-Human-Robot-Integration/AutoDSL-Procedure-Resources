    "Step-by-Step Method Details:\nStep-by-Step Method Details:\nMouse Bone Marrow Collection\nTiming: ~10 min per mouse\nThis step describes the procedure for mouse dissection followed by collection of bone marrow.\nEuthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation.\nSterilize the dissection area, dissection kit, and the fur of the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nCut the skin of the abdomen and strip off the skin to the ankles.\nCut off the foot from the tibia just above the ankle and strip off the triceps surae along with the Achilles tendon.\nCut the patellar tendon, remove the quadriceps femoris and the biceps femoris muscles from the femur, and dislocate the hind limb from the hip joint.\nDislocate femurs and tibiae at the patella, remove residual muscles and connective tissues entirely using scissors (on paper towel), and place the bones in 20–30 mL of ice-cold PBS + 2% FCS in a 10-cm Petri dish (Greiner).\nFlush the femurs and tibiae with PBS + 2% FCS using a 21-gauge needle (Terumo) and a 10-mL syringe (Terumo) to collect the bone marrow plug and disperse the plug by refluxing through the needle.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 50-mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 680 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nCollection of the c-Kit-Positive Fraction\nTiming: ~60 min\nThis step describes the procedure for sorting of c-Kit+ cells with AutoMACS. This step is required in order to reduce the sorting time by FACS as well as to reduce the volume of antibodies used.\nDiscard the supernatant by inverting the tube quickly and remove droplets on the rim using a paper towel.\nAdd 5 mL of red cell lysis buffer (0.17 M NH4Cl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaHCO3) per mouse and incubate on ice for 1 min.",
    "Add 2 volumes of PBS + 2% FCS and centrifuge at 680 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 10–20 mL of PBS + 2% FCS\nFilter the cell suspension through a 40-μm nylon mesh (BD Biosciences) and centrifuge at 680 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 80 μL/mouse PBS + 2% FCS.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 1.5-mL tube.\nAdd an anti-CD16/32 antibody to block Fc-receptor (2 μL/mouse) and incubate for 5 min at 4°C\nAdd anti-c-Kit magnetic beads (Miltenyi) at a 1/5 v/v ratio and incubate for 15 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 0.5 to 1 mL of PBS + 2% FCS and centrifuge at 680 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nRepeat step 19.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of PBS +2% FCS, filter the suspension with a 40-μm filter, and transfer to a 5-mL tube. Then rinse the 1.5-mL tube with another 1 mL of PBS +2%FCS, and transfer to the 5-mL tube.\nEnrich c-Kit-positive cells using Auto-MACS Pro (Miltenyi) and the Possel-S program.\nTransfer the cell suspension of the positive fraction (2 mL) into two 1.5-mL tubes separately, centrifuge at 340 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and discard the supernatant.\nAntibody Staining\nTiming: ~45 min\nThis step describes the procedure for staining c-Kit+ cells with fluorescent-dye conjugated antibodies. This step is required in order to sort HSCs by FACS.",
    "Label cells with an antibody cocktail as follows: lineage markers (CD4, CD8a, Gr-1, Mac-1, Ter-119, B220)-PerCP-Cy5.5, c-Kit-APC-Cy7, Sca-1-PE-Cy7, CD150-PE, CD41-FITC, CD48-FITC, Flt3-APC, CD34-BV421. Alternatively, lineage markers (CD4, CD8a, Gr-1, Mac-1, Ter-119, B220)-PerCP-Cy5.5, c-Kit-APC-Cy7, Sca-1-PE-Cy7, CD150-BV421, CD48-FITC, Flt3-APC, EPCR-PE. Use all antibodies at 0.5 μL per mouse and mixed with 20 μL of PBS + 2% FCS. Resuspend the cell pellet to the antibody cocktail and combine the sample into one tube. Incubate cells for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS +2% FCS and centrifuge at 340 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 0.5–2 mL of PBS + 2% FCS + 0.1% propidium iodide, filter the suspension with a 40-μm filter, and transfer to a 5-mL tube.\nNote: If old mice (> 1 year old) are used, the CD41 antibody should be excluded to account for the high expression of CD41 in HSCs derived from old mice.\nOptional Steps\nIf compensation of fluorochrome is needed for the flow cytometer, prepare single-color stained bone marrow cells as follows. This step is mandatory when the configuration of the flow cytometer is altered. Following steps are branched from step 16.\nSplit bone marrow cells to the number of colors +1 (for no-stain control) you use and dispense them to 1.5-mL tubes. Cell number of around 5 × 105 in 50 μL of PBS + 2% FCS is optimal.\nLabel each of the compensation sample with 1μL of fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD45 antibodies for 30 min at 4°C. For instance, following samples are prepared: no-stain control, anti-CD45-BV421, anti-CD45-FITC, anti-CD45-PE, anti-CD45-PerCP-Cy5.5, anti-CD45-PE-Cy7, anti-CD45-APC, anti- anti-CD45-APC-Cy7.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS +2% FCS to each compensation sample and centrifuge at 340 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend cells in 0.5 mL of PBS + 2% FCS, filter the suspension with a 40-μm filter, and transfer to a 5-mL tube.\nPerform fluorescent compensation for the flow cytometer you use.\nCell Sorting\nTiming: 10 min per mouse\nThis step describes the procedure for sorting purified HSCs by FACS.\nSort HSCs with marker phenotype of CD150+CD41-CD48-Flt3-CD34- LSK or CD150+CD48-Flt3-EPCR+ LSK using the FACS AriaIIIu in a 1.5-mL tube containing 500 μL of culture media with 4% w/v BSA. Gating strategy we use is presented on Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/122-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating Strategy for Sorting HSC\n(A) Gating strategy for sorting CD150+CD41-CD48-Flt3-CD34- LSK cells.\n(B) Gating strategy for sorting CD150+CD48-Flt3-EPCR+ LSK cells\nCentrifuge sorted cells at 340 × g for 5 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant, and carefully aspirate the supernatant to avoid disturbing the pellet.\nKeep the cell pellet on ice until culture\nNote: When cultures are conducted in fatty acid-free conditions, use fatty acid-free BSA as a sorting medium to avoid fatty acid contamination in the culture medium.\nCell Culture\nTiming: 10–30 min\nThis step describes the procedure for culturing HSCs sorted by FACS.\nTransfer 200 μL of the medium prepared as described in the Medium Set Up section into each well of a 96-well round-bottom plate (Corning #353077).\nFill all unused wells with 100–200 μL of PBS to avoid medium evaporation.\nResuspend sorted HSCs in the culture medium at 30–100 cells/μL.\nAdd 10 μL of the HSC suspension to each well (300–1,000 cells per well). Considering the balance between technical variation and efficient use of cells, we usually culture 400 cells per well.\nPlace the culture plate in a humidified multi-gas incubator (Astec) at 37°C under 1% O2 and 5% CO2 conditions.",
    "Note: Culturing less than 300 cells per well would lead to the larger technical variation thus more wells per condition is needed to detect the biological difference. Although we have not experimentally tested, more than 1,000 cells would potentially compromise the maintenance rate due to cytokine/nutrient deprivation or accumulation of unfavorable cytokines/chemokines, so that we avoid culturing more than 1,000 cells in a single well.\nOptional Steps\nA flat-bottom tissue culture plate (Corning #353072) can be used instead of a round-bottom plate. A flat-bottom tissue culture plate reduces the cytokine requirement for HSC maintenance for unknown reasons.\nThe single-cell sorting mode of FACS Aria or other sorters can be used to directly sort HSCs in the culture well.\nUsing an 8-channel pipet when dispensing HSCs may reduce variation in cell counts.\nFor long-term culture (>7 days), half of the medium should be replaced every 3 to 4 days throughout the culture period. Carefully aspirate 100 μL of medium using a 200-μL pipette without disrupting the colony and add the same volume of pre-warmed fresh medium gently to each well."
