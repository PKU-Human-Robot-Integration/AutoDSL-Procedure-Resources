    "1. Preparing BN Gel1,2,3\nSet up the gel caster with 8 cm x 10 cm plates (rectangular glass and notched alumina plate) according to manufacturer's instructions using 0.75 mm spacers.\nPlace a gradient mixer on a stir plate and connect it with the peristaltic pump by a tubing. Attach a syringe needle to the other end of the tubing and place the needle between the glass and aluminum plate. Place magnetic stirrer to the \"heavy\" (H)-chamber.\nPrepare the 3.5% (v/v) and 12.5% (v/v) acrylamide (AA) solutions in 15 mL conical centrifuge tubes for the separation gel gradient (see recipes in Table 1). To prevent untimely polymerization, keep the centrifuge tubes on ice while preparing the solutions.\n\tCAUTION: Acrylamide is neurotoxic and carcinogenic, wear protective clothes and gloves.\nAdd 5% APS and TEMED right before pipetting the solutions to the gradient mixer. Pipet the 12.5% solution to the H-chamber.\n\t\nRemove air bubbles from the channel connecting the \"light\" (L) and H-chamber by opening the valve connecting the two chambers allowing solution to enter to the L-chamber. Close the valve and pipet the traces of solution back to H-chamber.\nFinally, pipet the 3.5% solution to the L-chamber.\nSwitch on the magnetic stirrer (the speed of the stir is not critical, but it should ensure proper mixing of the heavy and light solutions), open the valves and switch on the peristaltic pump. Allow the gel solutions to flow between the glass and aluminum plate, the flowrate should be roughly 0.5 mL/min. The needle must be above the liquid all the time, it can be attached to the upper part of the glass plate with a tape.",
    "When the H- and L-chambers have emptied, fill them with ultrapure water and allow water to gently overlay the gel surface. The gel polymerization takes around 1-2 hours at RT.\nPrepare the 3% acrylamide solution (see recipe in Table 1) for the stacking gel at RT. Pipet the stacking gel on top of the polymerized separation gel (before casting the stacking gel, remove the water overlaying the gel surface) and place a sample gel comb between the glass and aluminum plate avoiding air bubbles.\n\t\nAllow to polymerize 30-60 min at RT. Remove the comb gently under ultrapure water. Store the gel at +4 ˚C.\n\t\tPause point. The gel can be stored at +4 ˚C for a few days. The gel should be kept in moist conditions to avoid drying of the wells and the gel surface.\n2. Thylakoid Solubilization1,2,3\nNOTE: All steps should be performed under very dim light. Keep samples and buffers on ice.\nDilute isolated thylakoids with ice-cold 25BTH20G buffer to a final chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/mL. For 2D-BN-SDS-PAGE analysis roughly 4-8 µg of chlorophyll/ sample is suitable.\n\tNOTE: The thylakoids used in the experiments must be isolated from fresh leaves (for protocol of thylakoid isolation, see3)\nAdd an equal volume of detergent buffer, i.e., 2% β-DM (w/v) or 2% digitonin (w/v). Mix the detergent to the thylakoid sample gently with the pipet tip and avoid making air bubbles. The final concentration of the detergent is 1% and that of the thylakoids 0.5 mg Chl/mL.\n\t\nSolubilize the thylakoids for 2 min on ice (β-DM) or 10 minutes at RT with continuous gentle mixing on a rocker/shaker (digitonin).",
    "NOTE: Digitonin and β-DM are generally used for the solubilization of thylakoid protein complexes. If other non-ionic detergents are used, the detergent concentration and the solubilization time must be first optimized. Usually the detergent concentration range from 0.5%-5% (v/v).\n\t\tCAUTION: Digitonin is toxic, wear protective clothes and gloves\nRemove the insolubilized material by centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 20 min, at +4 ˚C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube and add 1/10 (v/v) of CBB buffer to the sample.\n\tNOTE: When the overall composition of the thylakoid membrane protein complexes is examined, determining the yield and the represented thylakoid domain of solubilized fraction is recommended. To determine the yield of the solubilized material, take 5 µL of the supernatant to a new tube (before adding CBB) and measure the Chl content and Chl a/b ratio5.\n3. BN-PAGE1,2,3\nSet up the gel to a vertical electrophoresis system (e.g., Hoefer SE 250). Fill the upper buffer chamber with blue cathode buffer (see Table 1) and pour anode buffer to the lower buffer chamber.\nLoad thylakoid sample (e.g., 5 µg of chlorophyll) into the wells.\nStart the electrophoresis and gradually increase the voltage: 75 V for 30 min, 100 V for 30 min, 125 V for 30 min, 150 V for 1 h and 175 V until the complexes have been separated completely. Run the gel at +4˚C, either using a cold room or adjusting the gel temperature with a cooling system.\n\tNOTE: Change the blue cathode buffer to a clear cathode buffer when the sample front has migrated about one third of the gel.\nAfter the electrophoretic run, scan the gel with a photoscanner for image archiving.\n4. 2D-SDS-PAGE\nAssemble the vertical electrophoresis system (gel size 16 cm x 20 cm). Use 1 mm spacers.",
    "Prepare standard SDS gel (12% acrylamide, 6 M Urea, see recipe in Table 2) with a 2D-comb (single large well for the strip and one standard well for molecular weight marker).\nCut the lane from BN-gel and place it in a (5 mL) tube. Add 2 mL of Laemmli buffer (containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubate the strip for 45 min with gentle shaking at RT.\nPlace the lane, with a help of e.g., a spacer, on top of the gel avoiding air bubbles.\nPipet 5 µL of molecular weight marker on a narrow piece of filter paper and place the paper to the standard well.\nTo seal the BN-gel strip and the marker paper, pour 0.5% agarose (in running buffer) on top of the gel strip and allow to solidify.\nPerform electrophoresis according to standard protocols. After the electrophoretic run, visualize the proteins with e.g., Sypro Ruby stain or silver staining according to6.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
