    "Preparation of genomic DNA from SP-6 cells This protocol was essentially described in Kunoh et al. (2015b).Pick SP-6 cells from a glycerol stock with a sterilized toothpick, spread on MSVP agar plate, and incubate for 3–5 days at room temperature (RT).Pick several colonies of SP-6 cells on an MSVP plate with a sterilized toothpick, inoculate into 25 mL of MSVP liquid medium in a 50 mL polypropylene tube, and incubate for 2–3 days at RT by shaking at 70 rpm.Collect exponentially growing SP-6 cells (total 50–100 mL) by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 5 min.Wash the resultant cell pellet twice in 25 mL of TE buffer, resuspend in 5 mL of TE buffer containing 20 μg/mL proteinase K and 0.6% SDS, and transfer to a 15 mL polypropylene tube.After incubation at 65 for 1 h, add 1 mL of 5 M NaCl and 800 μL of CTAB/NaCl solution to the cell suspension and incubate at 37 °C for one additional hour by shaking at 190 rpm.To eliminate proteins, add an equal volume (~7 mL) of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to the cell suspension, mix by inversion, and centrifuge at 7,000 × g for 15 min.Transfer the resultant aqueous phase to a new 15 mL polypropylene tube and perform chloroform extraction as described in step A5.For precipitation of nucleic acids, transfer the resultant supernatant to a new 15 mL polypropylene tube, add an equal volume (~5 mL) of isopropanol, and incubate at -20 °C for 1 h.Then, collect the pellet by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 30 min) and discard the supernatant, followed by rinsing the pellet in ~5 mL of 70% ethanol.",
    "After drying up the pellet at RT for 15 min, resuspend it in 500 μL of TE buffer containing 20 μg/mL ribonuclease A by pipetting, transfer it to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and incubate the suspension at 37 °C for 30 min.To remove ribonuclease A from the suspension, add an equal volume (~500 μL) of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), mix by inversion, and centrifuge (15,000 × g, 30 min). Then, transfer the resultant aqueous phase to a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Repeat this step once more.For precipitation of nucleic acids, add an equal volume (~500 μL) of ethanol and 1/10 volume (~50 μL) of 3 M CH3COONa solution to the resultant aqueous phase.After incubation at -20 °C for ~30 min, centrifuge the mixture (15,000 × g, 30 min) and remove the supernatant, followed by rinsing the pellet in 70% ethanol.After drying at RT for 5 min, suspend the resultant pellet in ~100 μL of TE buffer. Then, determine DNA concentration of the suspension by using a NanoDrop 2000c.Preparation of genomic DNA from B. subtilis 168 cells Pick B. subtilis 168 cells from a glycerol stock with a sterilized toothpick, spread on LB agar plate, and incubate at 37 °C overnight.Inoculate a single colony into 4 mL of LB medium in a test tube and incubate by shaking at 37 °C overnight.Transfer cell culture to 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes and harvest the cells by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 1 min).Resuspend the resultant cell pellet in 300 μL of TEN buffer containing 10 μg/mL ribonuclease A and 30 μg/mL lysozyme and incubate at RT for 20 min.To lyse the cells, add 9 μL of 10% SDS solution to the cell suspension, mix gently by inversion, and incubate at 50 °C for 10 min.",

Dilute approximately 10-fold by TE buffer and use the resultant DNA solution as a template for PCR.Construction of plasmids pUC18-Kmr and pUC18-mob To construct pUC18-Kmr, digest 20–50 ng of pSUP5011 and pUC18 with SmaI and HindIII at 37 °C for 30 min. To construct pUC18-mob, digest these plasmids with BamHI.Purify the insert DNAs from pSUP5011 (1.3 kb HindIII-SmaI and 1.8 kb BamHI fragments, respectively) and digest pUC18 by agarose gel extraction.Clone the purified insert DNA into pUC18 by using DNA Ligation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Transform E. coli DH5α cells with the ligation mixtures by electroporation, spread the cells on LB plates containing 50 μg/mL ampicillin sodium salt, and incubate at 37 °C overnight.Pick the resultant single colonies, re-streak them on LB agar with 50 μg/mL ampicillin sodium salt, and incubate at 37 °C overnight.Inoculate the resultant colonies into 4 mL of LB medium containing 50 μg/mL ampicillin sodium salt in test tubes and incubate by shaking at 37 °C overnight.Harvest the cells by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 1 min) and extract the plasmid DNA (pUC18-mob and pUC18-Kmr) using the GenEluteTM Plasmid Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Confirm the plasmid DNAs by digesting the restriction enzymes.",
    "Construction of the plasmid pUC18-mob-ΔLcho_0008::Kmr for Lcho_0008 gene deletion (see Figures 1 and 2) Standard overlap extension PCR, DNA extraction from agarose gel, and iVEC3 system are described in Sections H, G, and I, respectively.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4652/bioprotoc-13-08-4652-g001.jpgFigure 1. An overview of plasmid construction (see Kunoh et al. 2022). To construct a plasmid for the gene replacement of Lcho_0008 with the kanamycin resistance gene (Kmr), we first inserted fragments containing Kmr and mob from pSUP5011 into pUC18, respectively. Then, the upstream and downstream of Lcho_0008 (approximately 1.5 kb) and the spoVG terminator (approximately 0.1 kb) were amplified using genomic DNAs isolated from L. cholodnii SP-6 and B. subtilis 168, respectively. In parallel, Kmr was amplified using the pUC-Kmr plasmid as a template. These four fragments were stepwise joined by overlap extension PCRs (also see Figure 2) and cloned into the pUC-mob plasmid by the iVEC3 system, resulting in construction of the plasmid pUC18-mob-ΔLcho_0008::Kmr. Now, the resultant plasmid can be used not only for the gene replacement of Lcho_0008 but for the amplification of the Kmr-spoVG terminator cassette as the template to construct other plasmids, such as pUC18-mob-ΔLcho_3510::Kmr. Lcho_0008_5′ and Lcho_0008_3′, and Lcho_3510_5′ and Lcho_3510_3′ represent upstream and downstream fragments of these genes, respectively. spoVG represents the spoVG terminator.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4652/bioprotoc-13-08-4652-g002.jpgFigure 2. An overview of overlap extension PCR. The amplified PCR products contain overlapping 40 bp regions at both ends, whose Tm values were designed to be 65–76 °C (Ave. 70). These overlapping 40 bp regions are important for the overlap extension PCRs. Lcho_0008_5′ and Lcho_0008_3′ represent upstream and downstream fragments of Lcho_0008, respectively. spoVG represents the spoVG terminator.Amplify the upstream (approximately 1.5 kb) and downstream (approximately 1.5 kb) regions of Lcho_0008 gene by PCR using SP-6 genomic DNA as a template and Lc0008_F_out/Lc0008_Km_2 and term-Lc0008-1/Lc0008-R-out primer sets, respectively (see Table 1).Table 1.",
