    "The mice used in this work were cared for and handled in accordance with the guidelines of the European Union Council (86/609/EU) for the use of laboratory animals.\n1. Preparation of Required Solutions\nStock Solutions\n\t\n10x Poly-L-Ornithine (PLO) Solution: weigh out 10 mg of PLO hydrobromide (molecular weight = 30,000-70,000) and dissolve in 70 ml of sterile water.

Filter, aliquot, and store at 4 °C.\n1 M HEPES Solution: Weigh out 23.8 g of HEPES and dissolve in sterile water to a total volume of 100 ml. Filter, aliquot, and store at 4 °C.\n70% (v/v) Ethanol: Dilute 70 ml of absolute ethanol with 30 ml of sterile water.\nPhosphate Buffered Saline with Glucose and Antibiotics (PBS-GAB): add 10 ml of 30% glucose solution and 5 ml of penicillin-streptomycin solution to 500 ml of Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline. Store at 4 °C.\nInactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (iFBS): Thaw bovine serum overnight at 4 °C and inactivate at 56 °C for 30 min. Aliquot into 50 ml and store at -20 °C.",
    "Culture Medium: In sterile water, mix successively 40 ml of 5x DMEM/F12-Ham, 1 ml of 1 M HEPES, 2 ml of 200 mM L-Glutamine, 2 ml of penicillin-streptomycin, 4 ml of 30% glucose and 3 ml of 7.5% NaHCO3 to a final volume of 180 ml. Filter and use the same day.\nHormone Mix\n\t\nPrepare 180 ml of culture medium. Dissolve 200 mg of apo-transferrin in this medium.\nWeigh out 50 mg of insulin and dissolve in 2 ml of 0.1 M HCl. Add slowly 8 ml of sterile water while mixing gently. Dilute this solution in the culture medium.\nWeigh out 19.3 mg of Putrescine dihydrochloride and dissolve in 10 ml of sterile water. Add the 10 ml solution to the hormone mix.\nPrepare a 3 mM sodium selenite solution in sterile water and a 2 mM progesterone solution in absolute ethanol. Add 20 μl of each solution to the hormone mix.\nFilter the hormone mix, aliquot into 10 ml and store at -20 °C.\n2. Preparation of Culture Plates and Instruments\nFBS Coating of the Culture Plates: The day prior the dissection, prepare 180 ml of culture medium. Add 10 ml of iFBS to 90 ml of culture medium. Add 300 μl/well of culture medium/10% iFBS into poly-D-lysine precoated 24-well plates. Incubate overnight at 37 °C. Store the remaining media (with and without iFBS) at 4 °C.\nSterilize the instruments and Pasteur pipettes. Gather the equipment listed in Materials table as well as a Class II laminar flow hood and a CO2 incubator.\n3. Dissection of Mouse Mesencephalon",
    "Sacrifice an E13.5 pregnant mouse (according to institutional guidelines). Clean the abdomen of the mouse with 70% ethanol and open the abdomen wall. Collect the uterine horns, open them using delicate scissors, dissect each embryo from the uterine horns, and remove the amniotic membranes. Place the embryos in a 100 mm Petri dish containing sterile PBS-GAB and wash them by transfer in 3 successive identical baths using forceps. For dissection, place the embryos by 3 in a 60 mm sterile Petri dish.\nMove the final Petri dish under the stereomicroscope. Do not behead the embryos. Using Vannas scissors, excise the brains.\n\t\nCarefully remove and discard the fore- and hindbrain regions. To the rostral side, cut close to the thalamic region, to the caudal side cut at the isthmus region, remove the superior colliculus.\nOnce the ventral midbrain is isolated, carefully remove meninges using ultra fine forceps. Collect the dissected segments, without the meninges, in a sterile 13 ml tube filled with PBS-GAB.\nClean the tube containing the mesencephala thoroughly with 70% ethanol and bring it under the hood.\n4. Cell Dissociation\nWash mesencephala 3x with sterile PBS-GAB. Allow brain fragments to settle between each wash and avoid disrupting the tissue. After the last wash, remove carefully as much solution as possible and incubate brain segments in 3 ml of Trypsin/EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.\nFire-polish the Pasteur pipettes to maximize the survival of the neurons as the end of a non-polished glass pipet is sharp and can damage the cells during the dissociation steps. Slightly reduce the extremity diameter (up 0.5 mm) of the Pasteur pipette while fire-polishing it.\nCarefully remove as much Trypsin/EDTA solution as possible and add 10 ml of culture medium/10% iFBS. Wash brain segments 3x with culture medium/10% iFBS.",
    "Using the fire-polished Pasteur pipette, begin dissociation of mesencephala in 6 ml of culture medium/10% iFBS. Triturate 10x (avoid air bubbles), allow the chunks to settle, then collect the medium in a new sterile 13 ml tube.\nAdd 6 ml of culture medium, repeat the previous step once and collect the medium containing dissociated cells in the same 13 ml tube.\nCentrifuge cells at 160 g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in culture medium supplemented with 10% hormone mix.\n5. Cell Plating\nCount cells in suspension in a Malassez cell and adjust the volume of medium to a concentration of 600,000 cells/ml. Around 1,700,000 cells can be obtained from one mouse mesencephalon.\nRemove FBS-containing coating medium from 24-well plates and add in each well 1 ml of cell suspension (600,000 cells/well, 2-4% of TH+ cells).\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2/95% air. No medium change is necessary. Dopaminergic neurons are mature after around 5-7 days in vitro (consistent expression of the dopamine transporter). Keep cells in culture up to 15 days without medium replacement.\n6. Immunofluorescence Protocol\nCleaning of the Coverslips\n\t\nThe day before the dissection, add 10 ml of 1 M HCl into a Petri dish. Lay at the surface of the liquid 12-15 glass coverslips and wait 15 min.\nSink the coverslip into the liquid and wait for 15 min.\nRemove HCl and wash 3x with water.\nWash the coverslips quickly with pure ethanol once, then add pure ethanol to the dish and wait for 30 min.\nUnder the hood, remove cleaned coverslips from ethanol and add 1 coverslip per well of a 12-well cell culture plate using sterilized forceps.\nWash coverslips twice with sterile water (1 ml/well). Then, wash them once with sterile PBS.\nCoating of the Coverslips",
    "Remove PBS and add 500 μl/well of 2x PLO (diluted in PBS). Incubate for 4 hr at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator.\nRemove the PLO solution and wash 3x with sterile PBS.\nRemove PBS and add 500 μl/well of 20% iFBS/1 g/ml Laminin. Incubate overnight at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator.\nPlating the Cells for Immunofluorescence\n\t\nRemove coating medium from 12-well plates.\nAdd 900,000 cells/well in 2 ml volume and grow the cells at 37 °C in the incubator. Cells can be kept in culture up to 15 days without medium replacement.\nImmunostaining\n\t\nRemove medium from 12-well plates and wash with 500 μl/well DMEM preheated at 37 °C.\nAdd 500 μl/well of DMEM preheated at 37 °C, then add gently 160 μl/well of 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA, 2% final concentration) and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nRemove PFA and wash 3x with PBS/0.1 M glycine for 10 min.\nRemove PBS, add 300 μl/well of PBS/0.05% Triton X-100/20% Goat serum and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nRemove medium, add 300 μl/well of primary antibody diluted in PBS/0.05% Triton X-100/1% Goat serum and incubate for 2 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies that can be used for the detection of dopaminergic neurons and characterization of the culture are indicated in the Materials table. Keep 1 well without primary antibody to assess for background of the different secondary antibodies.\nRemove medium and wash 3x with PBS/0.2% gelatine for 10 min.\nRemove medium, add 300 μl/well of secondary antibody diluted in PBS/0.05% Triton X-100/1% Goat serum and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature, in the dark. Secondary antibodies used are indicated in the Materials table.\nRemove medium and wash 3x with PBS/0.2% gelatine for 10 min.\nRemove medium and wash 3x with PBS.",
    "Mount the coverslips on glass slides cell side down in a drop of VECTASHIELD. Keep the slides at room temperature overnight to let the mounting medium dry, then store them at 4 °C.\nAcquire images using a confocal microscope or a phase-contrast microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Representative images were acquired with a Leica SP2 UV confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
