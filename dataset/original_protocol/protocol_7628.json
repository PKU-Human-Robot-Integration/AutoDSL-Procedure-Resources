    "Part I: Identification of acetylation sites by mass spectrometry Protein extraction Collect 30–50 mg of third-instar larvae (L3) of FASNFlag flies with a Flag knock-in at FASN locus in a microcentrifuge tube. Samples can be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.Make lysis buffer 1 right before protein extraction.Add 300 μL of lysis buffer 1 to each tube. Homogenize larvae with a pestle gun on ice until larvae are shattered.Sonicate for 10 s at 10–20 amplitude.Bring volume to 800 μL with lysis buffer 1. Incubate samples on ice for 20 min.Spin at 20,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a new tube. Repeat the centrifugation step twice or until the supernatant is clear.Pipette 5 μL of lysate to a new tube. Dilute ten times with lysis buffer 1. The protein concentration of each sample is determined by PierceTM BCA Protein Assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Dilute protein to an equal amount according to the PierceTM BCA Protein Assay. The optimal amount of total protein for FASN pull down assay is approximately 1 mg. Bring volume to 1 mL with lysis buffer 1.Pause step:  Proteins can be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.Immunoprecipitation Add 25 μL of SureBeadsTM Protein G magnetic beads to a clean microcentrifuge tube.Wash the beads three times with 200 μL of lysis buffer 1: vortex for 5 s to resuspend the beads and centrifuge at 10,000× g for 1 min. Collect beads using a magnetic bead rack and remove the buffer by pipetting.Add protein lysate from Step A directly to the beads. Incubate at 4 °C on a rotor for 30 min to remove non-specific bindings.Briefly spin down the bead-lysate mixture. Collect beads using a magnetic bead rack and transfer lysate to a fresh microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Add 10 μL of ANTI-FLAG® M2 antibody (anti-FLAG) to 1 mL of protein lysate (1:100 dilution).Incubate antibody-lysate mixture on a rotor at 4 °C overnight.Add 100 μL of SureBeadsTM Protein G magnetic beads to a clean microcentrifuge tube. Wash the beads three times with 500 μL of lysis buffer 1 as described above.Add the antibody-lysate mixture to the beads. Vortex briefly to resuspend the beads.Incubate the antibody-lysate-beads mixture on a rotor at 4 °C for 3 h.Collect beads using a magnetic bead rack and discard the liquid by pipetting.Wash the beads three times with 1 mL of lysis buffer 1. Rotate at 4 °C for 10 min between each wash.Collect beads using a magnetic bead rack and carefully remove all liquid. Add 30 μL of denature buffer. Resuspend the beads by gently tapping the tube.Heat samples at 95 °C for 5 min to elute proteins from the beads, gently tapping the tube at the halfway point.Briefly spin samples and place the tube in a magnetic bead rack. Transfer elution to a new microcentrifuge tube.Pause step:  Eluted and denatured proteins can be stored at -20 °C or lower.Electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining Load 30 µL of protein samples from Procedure B on a 4%–20% Mini-PROTEAN® TGXTM Precast protein gel for electrophoresis.Apply Coomassie Blue stain to the protein gel according to the manufacturer’s protocol to visualize the protein.Cut protein bands with approximately 250 kDa molecular weight; the gel slices can be temporally stored in a microcentrifuge tube with distilled water at 4 °C (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4873/bioprotoc-13-21-4873-g001.jpgFigure 1. Protein electrophoresis gel showing immunoprecipitated fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein after Coomassie Blue stain. Protein bands at approximately 250 kDa were cut for further analysis.Samples are shipped to a Mass Spectrometry Facility for in-gel digestion, desalting, lyophilization, and MS analysis to detect acetylation sites.",
    "Acetylated site identification by mass spectrometry and data validation Proteomics analysis to identify acetylated lysine residues is normally performed by the Mass Spectrometry Facility. Raw data can also be acquired and processed through proteomics data analysis platforms (e.g., MaxQuant) if further analysis is desired. The use of MaxQuant has been well summarized before (Tyanova et al., 2016).MS-based analysis has identified eight acetylated lysine residues of FASN that are immunoprecipitated from L3 stage larvae, and the results are compared with previously identified acetylation sites of FASN, which can be acquired from open-access databases such as Protein Lysine Modification Database (PLMD) (Xu et al., 2017) and PhosphoSitePlus® PTM Resource (Hornbeck et al., 2014) (Table 1).Table 1. List of the eight acetylated lysine residues of fly FASN identified by mass spectrometry table:",

    "Acetylation of the lysine residue K813 is further validated using an Ac-K813 specific antibody.To verify the acetylation of K813 residue identified from MS, we first generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody against synthetic peptides with acetylated K813 (Yenzym antibodies, CA, USA). The peptide sequence is NAEGVFA-acK-AVNSSG. which covers amino acids 806–819 of the MAT domain of the fly FASN protein.We then expressed recombinant KS-MAT didomain of FASN protein using E. coli BL21 (DE3) expression system for the use of acetylation validation experiment.To validate the acetylation of K813 of the KS-MAT recombinant protein, we incubated recombinant proteins with different amounts of acetyl-CoA for 1 h and checked the acetylation of K813 by western blot analysis and Ac-K813 antibody. Interestingly, K813 was rapidly acetylated by acetyl-CoA in a dosage-dependent manner (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4873/bioprotoc-13-21-4873-g002.jpgFigure 2. Acetylation of K813 residue of the recombinant fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein (KS-MAT domain) was detected after Acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) treatment. Acetyl-K813 antibody was used in the western blotting analyses.Part II: FASN activity assay Protein extraction Collect 20–30 mg of L3 larvae of ywR flies in a microcentrifuge tube. Samples can be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.Add 300 μL of lysis buffer 2 to each tube. Homogenize larvae with a pestle gun on ice until larvae are shattered.Sonicate for 10 s at 10–20 amplitude.Centrifuge at 3,500× g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer lysate to a new tube and centrifuge again at 21,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C. Repeat twice.Pipette 5 μL of lysate to a new tube. Dilute ten times with lysis buffer 2. The protein concentration of each sample (mg/mL) is determined by Pierce Coomassie Bradford assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Pause step:  Proteins can be temporarily stored at -80 °C.",
    "FASN activity assay To generate NADPH standard curve, measure the absorbance of different dilutions of NADPH: dilute 24 mM NADPH stock solution with distilled water to prepare 12, 6, 3, 1.5, and 0.75 mM standard solutions. Add 200 μL of distilled water to the wells of a 96-well plate and 2 μL of different dilutions of NADPH to generate 0.24, 0.12, 0.06, 0.03, 0.015, and 0.0075 mM/well standards. Read at A340nm on a plate reader.On the same 96-well plate, add 20 μL of fly protein extracts and 200 μL of freshly made FASN reaction buffer.Read plates at A340nm at 37 °C for 3 min (1 min intervals) to measure background NADPH oxidation.Add 2 μL of 5.8 mM Malonyl-CoA (final concentration: 58 μM) to each well.Read at A340nm at 37 °C for 15 min (1 min interval) to determine FASN-dependent oxidation of NADPH.Calculation Use the values obtained from the appropriate NADPH standards to plot a standard curve.The rates of A340nm change are corrected for the background rate of NADPH oxidation. FASN activity is normalized against protein amount and calculated in nmol NADPH oxidized min-1 mg protein-1.Calculate the average reduction of OD readings within 15 min: Rate 1 = (OD_0 min - OD_15 min)/15. Calculate the rate of OD change of background readings within 3 min: Rate 2 = (OD_0 min - OD_3 min)/3. Correct the rate of A340nm change: Rate = Rate 1 - Rate 2.Convert the corrected OD reduction rate (Rate) to change of NADPH concentration (mM) per minute according to the standard curve (C). Calculate the reduction of NADPH amount per min in 200 μL reaction: C × 200 (nmol/min).Calculate the amount of protein added to each well (mg): Protein concentration (mg/mL) × 0.02 mL.Normalize reduction of NADPH against protein amount (nmol/min/mg of protein).",
    "In Figure 3, we show that FASN activity decreases in the fly larvae with a specific acetylation-deficiency mutant (FASNK813R) where the lysine residue at 813 position was mutated to arginine.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4873/bioprotoc-13-21-4873-g003.jpgFigure 3.

FASN activity was determined by oxidated NADPH per minute per milligram of protein. Fold-change of FASN activity is presented. Data are presented as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA; ***p-value < 0.001; ns. not significant."
