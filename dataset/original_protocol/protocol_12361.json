  "procedures": [
    "Zebrafish were raised and bred according to standard procedure; experiments were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of Embryos/larvae\nTo conduct timed matings, set up adult male and female Tg(fabp10a:CFP-NTR)s931 hemizygous or homozygous fishes O/N and place a divider between them. Remove this divider the following morning when mating is desired. Collect embryos by straining the water using a fine plastic mesh strainer.\nTurn the strainer upside down and rinse the mesh surface with a fine stream of egg water dispensed from a squeeze bottle. Transfer 100 embryos into a 100 mm petri dish with 25 ml of egg water. Keep no more than 100 embryos per petri dish and raise them at 28 °C.\nTo inhibit pigmentation, add phenylthiourea (PTU) into the petri dishes prior to 10 hr post-fertilization (hpf), and raise embryos/larvae until 80 hpf. The final concentration of PTU is 0.2 mM. CAUTION: PTU is toxic. Use in accordance with appropriate handling guidelines.\nAnesthetize the larvae by adding 3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester (Tricaine), at a final concentration of 0.016%, into the petri dishes. Then, using an epifluorescence microscope, sort CFP-positive larvae. Use larvae with a similar liver size and discard those with a smaller or larger liver.\n\tNOTE: any CFP-positive larvae, regardless of intensity, can be used because there is no difference in the extent of hepatocyte ablation between the hemizygous and homozygous larvae. CAUTION: tricaine is toxic. Use in accordance with appropriate handling guidelines.\nRemove the egg water containing Tricaine and add egg water supplemented with 0.2 mM PTU. Keep the embryos/larvae at 28 °C.\n2. Mtz Treatment",
    "Prepare fresh 10 mM Mtz solution by dissolving 0.171 g of Mtz powder in 100 ml egg water supplemented with 0.2% DMSO and 0.2 mM PTU. To completely dissolve the Mtz, mix the solution at RT with rapid stirring for 20-30 minutes. To help solubilize Mtz and to enhance Mtz permeation into the larvae, add DMSO when preparing Mtz. CAUTION: prolonged exposure or increased concentration of Mtz is toxic. Use in accordance with appropriate handling guidelines.\nSeparate the larvae into control and experimental groups by transferring desired number of larvae into two different 100 mm petri dish or multi-well plate. For the experimental group, keep the larvae in 10 mM Mtz solution; for the control group, keep them in egg water containing 0.2% DMSO.\nCover the plates or petri dishes containing the Mtz solution with aluminum foil to prevent the photo-inactivation of Mtz, and incubate at 28 °C. The duration of Mtz treatment depends on the larval stage and the transgenic line.\nTo observe similar severe hepatocyte ablation in the Tg(fabp10a:CFP-NTR) line, treat the larvae with the Mtz solution from either 3.5 days post-fertilization (dpf) (for a duration of 36 hr) or from 5 dpf (for a duration of 24 hr).\n3. Analysis of Biliary-driven Liver Regeneration\nAt the end of the ablation period, remove the Mtz solution from the plates. Wash the Mtz-treated larvae by adding 25 ml of egg water. Swirl the plate 2-3 times to wash the larvae before discarding the egg water. Repeat three times and then immerse the larvae once more in egg water. To avoid heart edema and larval death in the Mtz-treated larvae, add a lower concentration of Tricaine, at a final concentration of 0.008%, to immobilize the larvae.",
    "For liver analysis, examine the liver size of the Mtz-treated larvae under an epifluorescence microscope with the CFP filter. Assess hepatocyte ablation levels based on the relative liver size: large (non-ablated; 0-10% larvae), medium (partially ablated; 10-20%), and very small (fully ablated; 80-90%).\nRemove the larvae with non-ablated or partially ablated livers. Only keep larvae with a tiny liver, which is indicative of severe hepatocyte ablation. For liver analysis at the regeneration 0 hr time point (R0h), harvest the larvae after Mtz washout and CFP sorting. Otherwise, keep the sorted larvae in egg water supplemented with 0.2 mM PTU until ready for harvesting.\nTransfer harvested larvae into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and replace egg water with the fixation solution of 3% formaldehyde in PEM buffer. Incubate the tube on a rotator O/N at 4 °C.\nReplace the fixation solution with 1 ml of PBSDT and rotate the tube containing the larvae on the rotator for 5 min.\nTransfer the fixed larvae into a 100 mm petri dish containing PBSDT and using forceps, manually remove yolk and pectoral fins under a dissecting microscope. Transfer up tp 20 dissected larvae into a 1.5 ml tube.\nReplace PBSDT solution with 1 ml of blocking solution and rock the tube on a rotator at RT for 2 hr.\nReplace blocking solution with 100 µl of blocking solution containing primary antibodies. Slowly rock the tube on a rotator O/N at 4°C.\nRemove the primary antibody solution and wash with PBSDT 5 times for 10 min each time. Then add 100 ul of blocking solution containing secondary antibodies and rock it on a rotator at RT for 2hr.\nWash 5 times with PBSDT for 10 min each time at RT by rocking on a rotator.",
    "Orient the larvae laterally on a microscope slide and add a drop of mounting media. Carefully cover them with a cover glass and seal the cover glass with a nail polisher. Now, it is ready for confocal microscopy.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
