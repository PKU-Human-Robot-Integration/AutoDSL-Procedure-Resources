    "Notes before starting protocol: Fibrinogen is a blood derived protein and thus appropriate safety training must be completed before handling. This protocol requires 2 days to complete so time the desired stem cultures appropriately to ensure they are ready for seeding. In terms of calculating how much fibrinogen to weigh out, three 35 mm petri dishes of tris buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing 110-130 mg of fibrinogen dissolved in 3 mL of TBS will be sufficient to produce 1 24 well plate containing 400 μl fibrin scaffolds in each well.\n1. Day One: Making fibrinogen solutions and overnight dialysis\nTake lyophilized fibrinogen out of the refrigerator and let it sit for 20 minutes to allow it to come to room temperature.\nAdd 3 mL of Tris buffered saline (TBS) to each 35 mm petri dish. Each plate of fibrinogen yields 2 to 3 mL of fibrinogen solution ranging in concentration from 12 to 20 mg/mL and the total amount of fibrinogen needed can be calculated based on these approximations.\nWeigh out approximately 100-130 mg fibrinogen (Fg) and sprinkle onto the surface of the TBS present in each dish. Wait 5 minutes for the fibrinogen to begin to go into solution. Cover petri dish with lid.\nIncubate petri dishes at 37°C for 2 hours to allow the fibrinogen to fully go into the TBS solution.\nWet dialysis tubing (7000 MW cut off) with TBS. Fold bottom end of the tubing and clamp end shut with a dialysis clamp.\nPipette the fibrinogen solutions from dishes into dialysis tubing. Fold over top end and clamp shut with a dialysis clamp.\nPlace dialysis tubing containing fibrinogen solution into a 4 liter container of TBS. Mix solution using stir plate set to low speed (100 rpm).",
    "Dialyze solution overnight on stir plate for at least 12 hours. The TBS solution does not need to be changed over this time period.\n2. Day 2: Polymerization of fibrin scaffolds and seeding of stem cells into scaffolds\nAll steps described for this process should be performed in a sterile tissue culture hood as these scaffolds will be seeded with stem cell cultures.\nRemove the fibrinogen solution from dialysis tubing and place into an appropriate sized conical tube (either 15 mL or 50 mL).\nFilter fibrinogen solution with a 5.0 μm syringe filter to remove large impurities in the solution. Depending on the volume of the solution, the use of multiple filters may be necessary to process the entire solution.\nSterile filter the fibrinogen solution with a 0.22 μm filter into a 50mL conical tube. Using an appropriate size pipette, determine the volume of the filtered fibrinogen solution to use later when doing calculations. Depending on the volume of the solution, the use of multiple filters may be necessary to process the entire solution.\nMeasure absorbance of the fibrinogen solution at 280 nm using the spectrophotometer. A dilution factor of 50 is often necessary to obtain an absorbance under 1.\nCalculate the concentration of protein present in the fibrinogen solution using the following equation: [Fibrinogen in mg/mL] = (A280 × Dilution Factor) ÷ 1.55 where 1.55 is the extinction coefficient at A280 for human fibrinogen 13. Next calculate the amount of TBS needed to dilute the concentration of the solution to 11.1 mg/mL of fibrinogen based on the initial volume. The final concentration of protein in the fibrin scaffolds will be 10 mg/mL after polymerization.",
    "Obtain sterile thrombin and calcium chloride solutions. First, add 15 μL thrombin solution (concentration: 40 U/mL - final concentration in scaffold will be 2 U/mL) to right side of each well in the first row of the 24 well plate. Next, add 15 μL of 50 mM calcium chloride solution to left side of each well. Finally, add 270 μL of the fibrinogen solution to the plate. Shake plate from side to side followed by shaking back to front to ensure mixing of solutions.\nLet the row containing the mixtures polymerize for 5 minutes at room temperature. The scaffolds become more opaque as they polymerize.\nRepeat steps 2.6 and 2.7 until the desired number of fibrin scaffolds have been polymerized.\nAfter the last 5 minute incubation, place the plates inside of a 37°C incubator to allow for complete polymerization of scaffolds.\nAfter the one hour incubation is complete, the next step is to seed the scaffold with embryoid bodies. Using a 20 μL pipettemen, select an individual embryoid body and place in the center of the fibrin scaffold. Check with microscope that each well contains a single embryoid body.\nAdd 5 μL of thrombin solution (concentration: 40 U/mL) and 5 μL of 50 mM calcium chloride solution on top of each embryoid body followed by 90 μL of fibrinogen solution to each well. The solution should form a bubble encapsulating the embryoid bodies.\nPlace plate back in 37°C incubator for an additional hour to ensure polymerization.\nAfter incubation, add 1 mL of the appropriate cell culture media to each well and place plate back into 37°C incubator.\n3. Representative Results",
    "Figure 1 shows a schematic of the side view of an individual well containing the 3D fibrin scaffold culture system seeded with an embryoid body. Figure 2A shows representative images of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells being cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers. These cells are then induced to form embryoid bodies, aggregates of cells containing neural progenitors, using an 8 day retinoic acid treatment protocol (Figure 2B) as previously described 14 while Figure 3 shows the appearance of an iPS-derived embryoid body after 3 days of culture inside of 3D fibrin scaffolds. Similar results have been obtained previously using mouse embryonic stem cells 7. Additionally, this method has been used to culture iPS-derived embryoid bodies produced using a different protocol involving retinoic acid and purmorphamine 15 inside of 3D fibrin scaffolds, demonstrating the versatility of this culture system.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3641/3641fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell culture and differentiation . To differentiate these cells into neural phenotypes, the iPS cells are cultured in suspension to produce aggregates of cells called embryoid bodies (EBs). These EBs are then treated with retinoic acid to induce neural differentiation and this protocol was previously used to induce neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells.
