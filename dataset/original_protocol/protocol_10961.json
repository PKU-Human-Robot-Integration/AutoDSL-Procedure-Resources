    "Animal protocols involving experimental animals followed guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical University.\nThe procedures of introducing SCI and measuring BF of spinal cord using laser Doppler equipment described below were used in a published study1.\n1. Preparation for the Surgery\nPrepare pentobarbital sodium solution 3% (w/v) in saline and administrate at the dose of 35 mg/kg.\n\tCaution: pentobarbital sodium is a controlled substance. Detailed records should be kept and solutions stored in a safe, locked location.\nSterilize equipment and prepare surgery area.\n\t\nClean the surgery equipment with the following steps: 75% ethanol cleaning, then autoclave at 121 °C for 30 min, then dry in a 60 °C oven overnight. Sterilize the surgery area with 75% alcohol.\n2. Preparation of Rat for Surgery\nAnesthetize the rat with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (35 mg/kg). The entire procedure should take 30 - 40 min including surgery, BF measurements, and sutures.\nShave the dorsal area of the rat from the lower back to the neck. The hair should be cut as short as possible. Place the rat on a 40 °C heating pad to maintain a constant body temperature.\n3. Laminectomy and the Concussion to the Spinal Cord\nNOTE: To perform laminectomy only for the sham group, follow steps 3.1 to 3.6.\nPosition the animal dorsal side up. Sterilize the shaved part with iodine followed by 75% alcohol using sterile cotton balls. Make a skin incision (4 cm) with the scalpel over the laminectomy site covering thoracic vertebrae T7 to T11.\nCut the attached muscles on both sides from T8 to T10 to expose the spinous processes, the laminae, and the facet joints.",
    "Use the scalpel to make incisions that disconnect the junction between T10 and T11. Further expose the junction by carefully by dissecting the muscle layer away to expose the bone.\nUse the scissors to further clear muscle away from the lamina and around the pedicle with small snips. This will open a small space between the vertebrae at T10 and T11 (Figure 1A). Slowly and delicately insert one hemostatic forceps into this gap and break the pedicle (Figure 1B). Make sure the curvature of the forceps is always positioned laterally, away from the cord. Repeat on the other side.\nExpose the spinal cord (Figure 1C) and carefully lift and break off the lamina. Be sure not to leave any free or jagged bone fragments behind.\nRepeat the process to further remove T9 and T8 laminae.\nMove the animal to the impactor equipment table and use the pair of Adson forceps attached to the table to stabilize the animal's spine by clamping on the spinous process of T7 and T11, then adjust the forceps to straighten the spine (Figure 1D).\nPut the animal under the impactor, aim the strike rod to the center of the exposed spinal cord and lower the rod to within 3-5 mm of the surface of the spinal cord.\nSet the impact parameters such as the impact force (160 KD) and dwell time (1 s)\n\t\nInduce the SCI by clicking the \"Start Experiment\" button on the software interface, then click \"yes\" on the following interface to start the impact automatically. After the impact, the software will display the actual data of the impact next to the set parameters, check the data to make sure it was close to the setting point (Figure 1E).",
    "NOTE: A typical sign for the success of the experiment was a short period of involuntary tail swing and limb movement after the impact. Stimuli to the tail to check for limb reflection could also be done. However, locomotor assessment such as the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale22,23 is necessary to determine the effectiveness of induced injury.\n4. Laser Doppler Scanning\nSee the Table of Materials for the details of the laser Doppler scanner used in this study. To scan the exposed spinal cord, place the rat dorsal side up on a black, non-reflective background.\nSet up scanning parameters: Open the scanning software, click \"Measure\" to enter the measurement graphical user interface and click on the \"Scanner setup\" button to open the scanner setup interface. To scan small areas such as in this experiment, select \"High Resolution\" under the \"Scan Size and Display Options\" for a fine scanning mode with higher resolution (256 × 256 points covering 4 × 10 cm2) (Figure 2A). Click on the \"Image Scan\" option to check the scanning perimeters (Figure 2B).\nClick on the \"Video and Distance\" option to check the live video image. Position the scanner 10-13 cm above the surgical window and move the background with the animal to center the exposed spinal cord on the scanning window (Figure 2C).\nUse the \"auto distant\" function to fine adjust the scanning height, note the height of scanning should be kept consistent across all measurements in the experiment Figure 2C.\nUse a nonreflective cover with a window to expose only the surgical area to further minimize background and mark the animal's direction.",
    "Click on the \"Repeat Scan\", set the number of scans (we use 8 repeat scans in this case) then click \"OK\" to open the repeat scan interface. Click the start button to start scanning and the whole process will take approximately 3 - 4 min (Figure 2D).\n5. Laser Doppler Monitoring\nWe used a scanner monitor with VP3 Blunt needle end delivery probe to monitor BF and SO2 over time. Attach the Laser Doppler probe perpendicular to a stereotaxic instrument to set up the monitoring equipment.\nPut the rat on the stereotaxic apparatus dorsal side up, underlay the animal with a small piece of Styrofoam when necessary to level the exposed spinal cord.\nLower the probe to the spinal cord to monitor BF.\n\tNOTE: Step 5.3 is crucial for the reproducibility of the measurement as the data readings are sensitive to the pressure applied to the probe, hence extra caution is required to not over- or under-position the probe.\n\t\nExamine the incision and remove any excessive liquid or blood using a sterile cotton pad.\nUse the apparatus's X and Y axis to locate the probe to 2 mm rostral to the center point of the exposed spinal cord or lesion point and avoid the central vein.\nUse the Z axis to slowly lower the probe to the level just touching the surface of the spinal cord. The probe should just touch the surface of the spinal cord but not so loose to allow any bright light to escape from the side of the contact point.\nData recording",
    "Open the data acquisition software, click on the \"new experiment\" button to open the setup interface. Under the \"General\" option check for the system configuration and click \"Next\" (Figure 3A), in the Display Setup select the channel for BF and SO2 and click \"Next\" (Figure 3B).\nInput file information and click \"Next\" (Figure 3C) to enter the data recording interface, click on the green triangle button to start recording data from the probe (Figure 3D).\nOnce the signal is stable, record data for 8 consecutive min. Then lift the probe and remove the animal from stereotaxic apparatus to suture the incision and put the animal into post-operative care.\n6. Sutures and Post-Operation Care\nSuture the incision: Insert a suture needle into the muscle on both sides of the incision. Pull the thread through, pulling the tissues together, thereby covering the exposed spinal cord at the site of removed laminae. Using the needle holder, pull the entire thread through, form three square knots and trim the thread as close to the knots as possible.\nSuture the skin with 3 - 4 square knots in the same way as suturing the incision, then trim the threads approximately 1 cm from the knots.\nPlace the rat on its side in its cage, avoiding contact between the surgery site and the cage bottom. Cages should be placed on heating pads.\nMonitor the animal until it wakes up from anesthesia to ensure no post-surgery bleeding and that the sutures remain closed.\nSubcutaneously inject Benzyl Penicillin Sodium in rat for 3 days following surgery, 120 mg/kg per day. Intraperitoneally inject Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) immediately after surgery and every 6 hours post-surgery for 1 day.",
    "To make sure animals have access to sufficient food and water, fit water bottles with extended spouts and put food close to the animal in the cage.\n\tNOTE: We conducted BBB rating scale to evaluate the hindlimb locomotor function of the animal 24 h post-injury to exclude animals with a BBB score above 0, therefore ensuring that the animal was paralyzed by the induced injury.\nPost-surgery, provide manual empty of urinary bladder by gently applying pressure on the abdomen twice daily, if necessary.\nSubscription Required.
