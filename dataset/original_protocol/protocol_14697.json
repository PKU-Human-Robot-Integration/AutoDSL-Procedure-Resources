    "1. Assessing GI50 for Compound(s) of Interest\nGenerate growth curve(s) for cell lines of interest to assess the appropriate seeding density. Plot the cell number at various time points following seeding (days 2, 4, 6 and 8) relative to day 0. This will provide a relative growth rate of the cell line of interest and should be used to assess the initial seeding density such that confluence is not reached in 96-well plates within 7 days.\nOnce growth curves have been determined, seed appropriate number of cells in non-transparent, clear bottom 96-well plates in 100 µl of cell media to assess GI50. Seed the number of cells based on the cell line used and determined in 1.1. Typically, seed 3x103 cells for fast-growing cell lines with a doubling-time of ~24 hr, e.g., HCT116.\n\t\nPrepare an assay plate (day-1). For the assay plate, seed cells at desired density in 100 µl of culture media in wells shaded in blue (Figure 1). Wells highlighted in white contain only media.\nPrepare a control plate (day-1). For the control plate, seed the same density of cells as in step 1.2.1 in 100 µl of culture media in a separate 96-well plate. This 'Day 0' reading will help in interpreting the cytostatic/cytotoxic nature of the compounds being analyzed (Figure 2).\nThe next day (day 0), read the control plate. Equilibrate luminescent cell viability reagent (cellTiter-Glo substrate mixed with buffer according to manufacturer's instructions) to RT and mix gently by inverting contents to obtain a homogenous solution. Add 80 µl of reagent to the 100 µl of cell/media mix and shake contents for 30 min to induce cell lysis.\n\t\nRecord luminescence with a luminometer set to an exposure of 0.1-1.0 sec and detection wavelength of 560 nm.",
    "Add test compounds (compounds of interest) to assay plates (day 0). Make a 1:4 serial dilution of compounds in DMSO at 200x final concentration for a total of 10 concentrations (9 dilutions containing compound and one DMSO only, compound plate). As an initial starting point, aim for a 200x lowest dose of 0.03 µM and a top dose of 2,000 µM (final volume 200 µl).\nAdd serially diluted compounds to medium to make a compound-medium mix at 10x final concentration (final volume 100 µl, intermediate plate). Store the compound plate at -20 °C for use on day 3 of the assay. Add 10 µl of compound-medium mix to cells in triplicates such that the highest dose is 10 µM (e.g., rows B, C and D, day 0) (Figure 1). Incubate assay plates for 3 days at 37 °C. Discard intermediate plate(s) after use.\nOn day 3, prepare a 400 µl 1x compound-medium mix using the compound plates prepared in 1.4. Invert assay plates to remove media and pat dry on autoclaved paper towels 2-3x to remove residual media. Add compound/media (100 µl/well) to wells shaded in blue and add 100 µl of media to perimeter wells to prevent evaporation (Figure 1). Re-incubate the assay plates at 37 °C for an additional 3 days.\nOn day 6, assess relative number of viable cells by performing a luminescence reading as described in step 1.3.\nUse the day 0 reading to assess the static/toxic nature of compounds. Toxic agents induce apoptosis whereas cytostatic agents induce cell cycle arrest. If compound is toxic (day 6 reading is below day 0 reading), consider choosing GI50, and GI50 x 5 concentrations for resistance assays. However, if the compound induces stasis (equal to or higher than d0 reading), consider GI100 and GI100x5 for resistance assays (Figure 2).",
    "2. Setting up Drug Resistance Assays\nIf working with a cytostatic agent, seed cells at a confluence of 30-40% in 150 mm2 tissue culture dishes (volume= 30 ml) for the resistance assay. If working with a toxic agent, seed at a 70-80% confluence.\nFor cell lines which harbor an intact mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism, incubate cells from step 2.1 O/N at 37 °C with the carcinogen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Treat cells with 30 µl of a stock solution of 50 mg/ml ENU (final concentration 50 µg/ml) to enhance genomic instability. For cell lines that have a defective MMR (Tables 2 and 3), treatment with ENU or other carcinogens may not be necessary.\n\t\nFor other cell lines, determine MMR-deficiency by NCI criteria using microsatellite instability12, or based on the published characterization using microsatellite instability assays or genomic/epigenomic profiling of MMR genes13-15.\nTreat cells with the test compound(s) of interest at the concentration determined in step 1.8. For highly toxic compounds which cause cell death in a typical three-day viability assay10, start with a low dose treatment (i.e., GI50) and incrementally increase the concentration (multiples of GI50) of compound every 2-3 weeks until robust resistance is observed. Replenish media and compound every 3 d.\nOnce the selection has been initiated, change media/compound mix every 3-4 days until resistant clones emerge. Resistance by definition emerges when treated cells show greater growth/viability during drug treatment relative to acute treatment of DMSO-treated control cells.\n3. Isolating Single Cell Clones\nExamine culture dish using phase-contrast microscopy (magnification 40x) for viable clusters of cells.\nMark satisfactory clones at the bottom of the dish with a marking pen. Pick clones that are of average size (larger colonies may originate from multiple cells) and well isolated from other colonies. Pick clones using one of two approaches outlined in step 3.3.",
    "Approach 1: Using a Pipettor (Figure 3)\nRemove growth media and rinse with 1x PBS to remove any floating cells.\nUse black marks as guide to 'picking' clones with pipet tip (attached to pipettor, p200 preferably).\nTransfer clones into 48-well plates with 200 μl fresh media (with half compound concentration to allow optimal recovery of cells).\nAllow cells to recover for 2-3 days before adding 200 μl fresh media/ideal compound concentration.\nContinue to change media/compound every 3-4 days and continue to expand clones.\nApproach 2: Using Cloning Discs (Figure 3)\nMark clones as described in step 3.2.\nPlace 3 mm cloning discs in a 10 cm tissue culture dish containing 5 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 2 min.\nAspirate media from dish containing resistant clones and overlay clones with trypsin soaked cloning discs using sterile disposable forceps.\nLeave for 1-2 min, depending on how easily clones lift off the plates, in a 37 °C incubator.\nPick up cloning discs using sterile forceps and transfer into 48-well plates with 200 μl fresh media and half concentration of compound.\nPipette up and down gently to dislodge the cells from cloning discs and incubate O/N at 37 °C (leave cloning discs in wells).\nThe next morning, remove the cloning discs from 48-well plates and replenish wells with 200 μl fresh media/compound (half ideal compound concentration).\nThree days later, replenish media with the ideal concentration of compound.\nContinue to change the media/compound every 3-4 days and continue to expand clones.\n4. Assessing Degree of Resistance of Isolated Clones\nOnce 10-20 colonies are expanded, generate GI50 curves as described in step 1 to assess the degree of resistance.",
    "Always include control populations treated with DMSO during the selection process. It is very likely that the spectrum of resistance is going to be large (some showing partial whereas others showing full resistance). Collect a few clones from each of these classes as the mechanism of resistance may vary between the two groups.\n5. Next-generation Sequencing\nSpin down 2 million cells (control and resistant clones) (500 x g for 5 min) in 15 ml conical vials for both gDNA and RNA collection (therefore 2 x 2 million).\nWash twice with 1x PBS and freeze pellets in -80 °C until ready for isolation.\nUse a commercial extraction kit to isolate RNA or gDNA according to manufacturer's protocol.\nSubmit samples for next-generation sequencing using vendor's protocol10.\n6. Bioinformatics analysis of samples (whole-exome sequencing)\nPreprocess sequence data according to a best practice DNA-seq pipeline16.\n\t\nMap all reads to reference human genome GRCh37 using BWA17. Convert uncompressed SAM formatted alignments to compressed BAM format with Samtools18. Sort alignments by coordinate with Samtools. Add read groups using Picard. (For specific BWA, Samtools and Picard commands, see Supplementary Text 1, lines 1-4)\nMark all duplicates reads using the MarkDuplicates command from the Picard tool set19. Index this file with Samtools. (Supplementary Text 1, lines 5-6)\nTo minimize mismatched bases across all reads, realign reads locally at regions harboring small insertions or deletions using an indel realigner20. (Supplementary Text 1, lines 7-8)",
    "To further improve the accuracy of variant calling, empirically recalibrate base quality scores using a base quality score recalibration tool. The base quality calibration tool should not only correct initial quality score, but also take into account covariation of several features, including read group, machine cycle, base position, and dinucleotide context (previous+current bases). Generate recalibrated BAM with Picard PrintReads. (For specific commands for this step, see Supplementary Text 1, lines 9-10)\nRepeat steps 6.1.1 through 6.1.4 (Supplementary Text 1, lines 1-10) for each sample sequenced.\nIdentify single nucleotide variation (SNV) in each clone using a paired variant calling tool19, 21-23. For each clone sequenced, run paired variant calling using the parental clone as the matched “normal”. (Supplementary Text 1, line 11)\nFilter recurrent, high-quality variants and prepare for annotation with a variant annotation tool24. Deprioritize variants not common to all resistant clones. (See R script in Supplementary Text 2)\nAnnotate variants with an annotation tool25, 26. Many variant annotation tools have an accompanying web app allowing data to be uploaded and processed by a remote server.\nUse a functional impact prediction tool27-29 to prioritize those variants predicted of having high functional impact. Like variant annotation, several tools are available for functional impact prediction through a web interface."
