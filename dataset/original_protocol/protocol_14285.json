    "The presented protocol follows the guidelines of human research ethics committee at Charles University, Faculty of Physical Education in Sport and has been previously approved as part of research.\n1. Familiarize All Subjects Before Isokinetic Testing by Following Steps\nEnsure that the subjects have not had any recent musculoskeletal injuries or pain in the lower limbs in the previous 6 months. If a subject reports recent knee pain, or has knee pain during testing, exclude the subject.\nAs eccentric isokinetic testing is likely a novel stimulus for many individuals, familiarize the subject with the protocols on a valid isokinetic dynamometer19,20 (steps 1.3 to 1.7.6, below) at least twice before participating in official testing. Instruct the subjects to not perform any lower body resistance training, or other strenuous exercises, 72 h before testing.\nTo begin, guide the subjects through a general warm up.\nInstruct the subjects to jog for 5-10 min or cycle for 5-10 min on an ergometer with a resistance of 1.5-2 W/kg of body mass with a cadence between 60-90 rpm.\nAfter cycling, instruct the subjects to perform two sets of 8-10 body weight lunges and 8-10 hamstring curls on a Swiss ball with each leg with 1 min of rest between sets.\nNext, guide the subjects through dynamic stretching of the lower limbs including the quadriceps and hamstrings21.\nShow the subject an example of the isokinetic torque-angle curve and explain that live visual feedback will be provided during the test.",
    "Explain that the subject should \"kick out as hard and fast as possible\" for concentric knee extension and \"pull back as hard as fast as possible\" for concentric knee flexion. Also explain that the machine will move on its own during eccentric actions, but that the subject should try to \"push as hard as possible\" during eccentric knee flexion (eccentric action of the quadriceps) and \"pull as hard as possible\" during eccentric knee extension (eccentric actions of the hamstrings).\nAllow the subject to ask any questions and make sure they understand what will happen during the test. Clearly state that if the subject experiences any pain or discomfort during the test that makes the subject wish to terminate the test at any time, the subject should inform the researcher immediately, and the test can be safely aborted.\nStart the pre-set protocol listed in Table 1, and continually guide the subject through the protocol.\nUsing the recommendations of Brown22, position the subject on the dynamometer in a sitting position with a hip angle of 100° of extension. Adjust the settings of the dynamometer to ensure that the subject's hips are all the way back and in contact with the chair and the dynamometer's axis of rotation axis is in-line with the axis of rotation of the subject's tested knee.\nInstruct the subject to hold a deep breath while fixing the shoulders, pelvis, and thigh of the tested leg using the pads and straps on the dynamometer. Fix the lever arm of the dynamometer to the distal part of the shin with the pad placed 2.5 cm over the apex of the medial malleolus, but do not support the non-exercised lower limb.",
    "Allow the subject to passively and actively go through the full extension and flexion range of motion while readjusting the straps, dynamometer settings, or both if needed.\nEnsure that the subjects can see a screen that shows the torque-angle curve and provide a verbal countdown to begin the test. Instruct the subjects to hold the handgrips located at the side of the seat during all testing efforts.\nStart the test and verbally encourage the subject by using phrases such as \"go\", \"push harder\", \"pull, pull, pull\", etc. During the rest intervals, provide the subject with short instructions about the upcoming task.\nAfter completing the protocol, allow the subject to get out of the dynamometer chair, and adjust the dynamometer to test the other limb.\nAfter repositioning the subject and adjusting the machine accordingly, perform the gravity correction measurement again and start the test for the untested lower limb.\nOpen the test results that show the angle-torque curve and check whether the subject achieved the selected speed of contraction for the whole movement.\nTo determine if the desired speed was accomplished, ensure that the angle-torque curve does not appear to be interrupted (Figure 1).\nIf the curve looks interrupted (Figure 2), it is likely that the subject did not push or pull against the lever arm fast enough for the dynamometer to register torque. If the subject was not able to reach the required angular velocity and register torque, continue with additional familiarization or exclude the subject from the study and check the possibility of an articular knee lesion23.\n2. Isokinetic Strength Measurement After Two Familiarization Visits\nSet up the dynamometer's software to perform the tests according to Table 1, and complete the protocol as described in steps 1.3 to 1.7.6.",
    "After the end of the protocol, allow the subject out of the chair and begin analyzing the data.\n3. Hamstrings to Quadriceps Functional Ratio Calculation\nUse the best peak torque values from all three trials at each given speed and type of muscle action. Insert the peak torque data and resultant ratios into a data organizing software that can graphically depict data such as Microsoft Excel.\nCalculate the H/QFUNC60 ratio by dividing the hamstring eccentric peak torque at 60°·s-1 by the quadriceps concentric peak torque at 60°·s-1.\nCalculate the H/QFUNC180 ratio by dividing the hamstring eccentric peak torque at 180°·s-1 by the quadriceps concentric peak torque at 180°·s-1.\nCalculate the H/QFUNC240 ratio by dividing the hamstring eccentric peak torque at 240°·s-1 by the quadriceps concentric peak torque at 240°·s-1.\nAfter creating a table similar to Table 2, compare the H/QFUNC ratios across different speeds and between the right and left limbs.\nCompare the measured peak values with normative data of a similar athletic group of the same age and gender.\nDetermine if bilateral imbalances are present by comparing the right and left limbs at each tested speed.\nDetermine if the ipsilateral H/Qconv ratio at the same speed is above or below 0.624. If the values are below 0.6, the ipsilateral hamstring weakness is present compared to the quadriceps; design a specific hamstring strengthening intervention (Section 4).\nDetermine if the ipsilateral H/Qfunc ratio increases along with increased speed and reaches the desired value of 1.012,18, preferably in the speed of 180°·s-1. If the HQfunc does not increase with the increased speed, implement hamstring training to resolve the reciprocal function of the hamstrings (Section 4).\n4. Eccentric Hamstring Strength Training Examples",
    "Consult with a trained exercise professional25, such as Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist, to select various exercises that target the hamstrings across a variety of muscle lengths, speeds, and movement patterns.\nConsult the exercise professional for advice regarding exercises that improve neuromuscular control during landing and jumping in addition to exercises reported to decrease hamstring injury risk.\nUnder the professional's guidance, use the Nordic curl (Russian curl) exercise which can strengthen the hamstrings and reduce the risk of injury26,27, as this exercise focuses on eccentric hamstring strengthening.\nUnder the professional's guidance, use unilateral knee flexions on a Swiss ball to strengthen the hamstrings and possibly reduce a bilateral strength deficit28,29.\nUnder the professional's guidance, use unilateral or bilateral Romanian deadlifts, the good morning exercise, or both to strengthen the hip extension function of hamstrings28,30,31.\nUnder the professional's guidance, use complex exercises to strengthen both the hamstrings and quadriceps during \"triple extension\" exercises where the hips, knees, and ankle simultaneously flex and extend such as the squat, deadlift, and lunge.\nUnder the professional's guidance, use exercises such as drop jumps or other repeated jumps to train proprioception in the lower limbs.\nUnder the professional's guidance, progressively increase the number of sets and repetitions in bodyweight exercises such as the Nordic curl and unilateral hamstring curl on the Swiss ball32, while also progressively increasing the external resistance and decreasing the number of repetitions in complex exercises (for an example, see Table 3).\nSubscription Required.
