  "procedures": [
    "All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of National University of Singapore.\n1. Preparation of Artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid (ACSF)\nPrepare the ACSF consisting of (in mM) 124 NaCl, 3.7 KCl, 1.0 MgSO4.7H2O, 2.5 CaCl2.2H2O, 1.2 KH2PO4, 24.6 NaHCO3, and 10 D-glucose. Ensure the pH of the ACSF is between 7.2-7.4 when bubbled to saturation with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 mixture (carbogen).21 Use this ACSF for both the dissection, slice preparation and for perfusion during the electrophysiological recordings.  \n\tNOTE: Use clean apparatus for measuring and holding the ACSF. Using unclean apparatus may lead to cloudy solutions or formation of precipitates. Use deionized water for all the preparations.\nPrepare a 2 L 10x ACSF stock excluding NaHCO3 and D-Glucose in a volumetric flask. Add reagents to deionized water in the following order: NaCl (144.96g), KCl (5.52g), MgSO4.7H20 (4.92g), CaCl2.2H20 (7.56 g), KH2PO4 (3.28 g) and top up to a volume of 2 L. Stir continuously for at least 30 min using a magnetic stirrer to ensure all reagents are dissolved. Store the stock in 4 oC and use within 2 weeks.\nPrior to the dissection and the experiments, dilute the ACSF stock in a volumetric flask along with the addition of required amounts of NaHCO3 and D-glucose. For 1 L solution, dilute 100 ml of the stock to 1 L after adding 2.07 g NaHCO3 and 1.802 g D-glucose. The ACSF should be a clear solution free of any precipitate or undissolved particles.",
    "Cool about 200-300 ml of ACSF on ice, to be used during dissection. Ensure that the ACSF used for dissection is between 2-4 °C. Use the remaining ACSF for electrophysiological experiments. Bubble all ACSF solutions to saturation with carbogen (5% CO2, 95% O2) continuously. While waiting for the ACSF to cool, prepare the dissection area and the slice chamber.\n2. Preparation of Interface Chamber  \nNOTE: An interface brain slice chamber, used for incubating the slices and maintaining them during electrophysiological recordings (Figure 2B), consists of two compartments. The lower chamber contains distilled water maintained at 32 °C by a temperature controller and continuously bubbled with carbogen.\nSwitch on the temperature controller and preset it at 32 °C. Wash the upper chamber for 10 to 15 min by running distilled water through the inflow tubing. Ensure that the upper chamber is clean before placing the net. Check that water level in the bottom chamber is about 70% filled with distilled water.\nPlace the net in the upper chamber to provide a resting surface for slices (Figure 2C). Adjust the outflow tubing to ensure that the solution level is sufficiently wetting the whole area of the net. Place the lid above the net to maintain a humidified carbogen atmosphere within the upper chamber.\nAdjust the flow rate to 1 ml/min. Maintain this flow rate throughout the slice incubation period and the experiment. Start carbogenating the freshly prepared 1x ACSF and immerse the inflow tubing into the ACSF. Allow 20 min for the ACSF to be saturated with carbogen and for the upper chamber to be filled with it.\n3. Preparation of Acute Hippocampal Slices",
    "NOTE: The dissection protocol consists of (1) Removal of brain from the animal into cold ACSF and (2) Isolation and slicing of the hippocampus. In order for neurons to remain viable, isolate and place the brain in cold ACSF quickly and complete the whole process including slicing within 3-5 min.\nRemoval of the brain into cold ACSF\n\t\nLay out the dissection tools in the manner shown in Figure 1A. Arrange the tools according to the order of use to facilitate the dissection process. Before starting, ensure all the dissection tools are ready.\nMount a razor blade, cleaned with ethyl acetate, absolute ethanol and distilled water, onto the manual tissue chopper (Figure 1B), secure it firmly and ensure that the cutting edge is evenly aligned. Test chopping a piece of filter paper to ensure that the blade is firmly secured. Set the sliding Vernier micrometer to its starting position.\nEuthanize the animal using carbon dioxide (CO2) in an induction chamber and decapitate with bandage scissors or Guillotine. Using an Iris scissors, remove the skin and fur above the skull. Make a cut through the posterior to remove the brainstem.Make a small incision along the right side of the skull and a longer incision on the left.\n\t\tCAUTION! Make only a small incision to the side that is used for the experiments to avoid damaging it. When inserting the scissors, make sure that the force applied is upwards to avoid damage to the brain.\nCarefully remove the skull with a bone rongeur starting from the left to the right side of skull to reveal the cortex. A thin layer of dura can also be seen. Carefully remove the frontal plates with the rongeur. Remove most of the dura along with the frontal plates.",
    "CAUTION! Be careful that the dura does not slice through the brain tissue.\nRemove the remaining dura, if any, specifically in the junction between cortex and cerebellum with the flat end of a spatula. For steps 3.1.5 and 3.1.6, maintain pressure upwards i.e., away from the brain to avoid damaging it. Using the spatula, gently scoop the brain into a petri dish filled with cold and carbogenated ACSF (2-4 °C), placed on an aluminum cooling block.\nIsolation of the hippocampus\n\t\nUsing a scalpel, make a straight cut to remove the cerebellum and another cut to remove the anterior portion of the brain (approximately one quarter). Make a shallow cut along the midline.\nCarefully remove the cortex with a sickle scaler, starting from the midline to reveal the dorsal hippocampus. Remove the layer of cortex above the hippocampus. Use fingers or angled forceps to support the brain. Make a small cut to the hippocampal commissure. Gently remove the hippocampus with the sickle scaler starting from the dorsal hippocampus using rolling motions.\n\t\tCAUTION! Be gentle to avoid stretching and tearing the hippocampus.\nRemove any cortex and connective tissues around the isolated hippocampus with the sickle scaler.\nSlicing the hippocampal tissue and transferring the slices onto the interface chamber\n\t\nPlace a piece of ACSF-soaked filter paper (Grade 1, 30 mm) on the slicing stage of the manual slicer. Scoop and place the hippocampal tissue onto the filter paper. Move the filter paper to align the hippocampus at a proper orientation in relation to the blade of the slicer so that the hippocampus is sliced at an angle of about 70o to the fimbria.",
    "Blot the excess solution surrounding the hippocampal tissue with a folded filter paper (Grade 1, 85 mm) leaving the hippocampus slightly wet. Start slicing the hippocampus transversely. Slice and discard tissue from the extreme end of the hippocampus where the slice morphology is not clear.\nSlice the remaining tissue into 400 µm-thick slices. Pick up hippocampal slices gently from the blade with a brush with soft bristles using gentle swiping movements and place the slices into a small beaker filled with cold carbogenated ACSF. Perform the steps 3.3.1-3.3.3 as quickly as possible since the hippocampal tissue is exposed to air.  \n\t\tNOTE: Generally two-thirds of the hippocampus is sliced, and 4-6 slices with clear morphology can be prepared.\nTransfer the slices gently onto the net in the slice chamber using a clean plastic Pasteur pipette with a broad tip (made by cutting away 2-3 cm of the tip). Carefully adjust the position of the slices on the net using a small syringe with a bent tip. Position the slices in a manner that facilitates electrode location and recording. Check to ensure that the slices are sufficiently surrounded by ACSF but are not submerged or floating (Figure 2C-D). Cover the chamber and incubate the slices for 2-3 hr.  \n\t\tNOTE: The pyramidal cell layer in the healthy slices should show some transparency.\n4. Recording of CA3-CA1 Synaptic Responses  \nNOTE: The electrophysiology set-up used for field potential recording is shown in Figure 2A. A Faraday cage is strongly recommended if the electrical interference is beyond the control after the proper grounding of the electrical settings. Many different types of submerged and interface chambers are commercially available. However, interface chambers are preferred as slices exhibit more robust synaptic responses in them.\nPositioning of electrodes",
    "Turn on the electrical apparatus (stimulators and amplifiers) to be used. Mount and secure the stimulating and recording electrodes in the plexiglass holders of the micromanipulators.  \n\t\tNOTE: We use monopolar, lacquer-coated, stainless steel electrodes of 5 MΩ resistance for both stimulating and recording purposes.\nBefore use, insert these electrodes inside the pulled glass capillaries and secure with epoxy glue exposing only small portion of the electrode tip (Figure 2E). This gives strength to the otherwise slender electrodes and helps to secure them firmly in the electrode holders.\nGuided under the microscope, position the stimulating electrode(s) in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region to stimulate the Schaffer collateral fibers and the recording electrode in the apical dendritic region of CA1 to record field-EPSP (fEPSP) responses.  \n\t\tNOTE: Approaching the liquid surface above the slice with the electrodes gives a sound that helps to locate quickly the surface of the slice (provided, the amplifier is connected to a loudspeaker).\nIn synaptic tagging and capture experiments, according to the need of the experiment, position two or three stimulating electrodes (S1, S2 or S3) on either side of the recording electrode to stimulate two or more independent but overlapping inputs. Position the stimulating and recording electrodes about 200 µm apart.\nIf necessary, locate another recording electrode in the stratum pyramidale layer for recording population spike (Figure 3A).When both the electrodes have touched the slice, using the acquisition software, give a test stimulation to ensure a proper fEPSP signal.  \n\t\tNOTE: We use biphasic, constant-current pulses (impulse duration 0.1 msec/half-wave) for test stimulation.\nOnce a proper fEPSP signal is obtained, carefully lower the electrodes about 200 µm deep using fine movement knobs of the manipulators. Allow 20 min for the slices to recover. Test the pathway independence with a paired-pulse facilitation protocol27,28.\nInput-output relation",
    "Determine the input-output relation (afferent stimulation vs fEPSP slope) for each input by measuring the slope value at a range of current intensities. Perform this between 20 µA to 100 µA. Then set the stimulation intensity for each input to obtain 40% of the maximum fEPSP slope. Keep this constant throughout the experiment.\nAfter 15-20 min, start recording the baseline. Monitor the fEPSP slope closely during this period and reset the stimulus intensity if the slope fluctuates more than 10% from the set value and start a new baseline. Record at least 30 min or 1 hr stable baseline before proceeding.  \n\t\tNOTE: For the test or the baseline stimulation, we use four sweeps of 0.2 Hz biphasic, constant current pulses (0.1 msec per polarity) given every 5 min. An average slope of these four responses is then considered as one repeat. The signals are filtered and amplified by a differential amplifier, digitized using an analog-to-digital converter and monitored online with custom-made software.\nInduction of LTP/LTD using stimulation protocols\n\tNOTE: Both LTP and LTD have been classified as early and late-LTP/LTD based on the requirements of protein synthesis; the latter requiring translation and/or transcription for its late maintenance [for review see4]. A variety of electrical stimulation paradigms can specifically induce the different forms of LTP and LTD.\n\t\nWTET: 100 Hz, 21 biphasic constant current pulses (0.2 msec per phase).\nSTET: Three bursts of 100 pulses for one second (100 Hz) every 10 min ( Pulse width  0.2 msec per phase).\n900 bursts over a 15 min duration . 1 burst consists of 3 pulses (0.2 msec width) with an interpulse interval of 50 msec (20 Hz).  The inter burst interval is 1 sec ( total number of pulses 2,700).\n5. Cleaning of Slice Chamber and Perfusion System",
    "After the recording is over, collect the hippocampal slices for further biochemical analysis or else discard appropriately. Turn off the carbogen supply and temperature controller. Wash the carbogen bubbler in distilled water.\nClean the net thoroughly with a brush and distilled water. Wash the rig for 15-20 min with distilled water at a higher flow rate. Once in 3-4 days, change the distilled water in the lower compartment of the chamber and also clean the chamber regularly with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution to avoid fungal growth."
