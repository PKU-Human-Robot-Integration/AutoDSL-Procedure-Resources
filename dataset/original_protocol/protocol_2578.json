    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of antigen probes\nTiming: 30 min preparation + 60 min incubation\nIn this step, antigen probes for detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific B cells are prepared by multimerization of biotinylated antigens with fluorescently labeled streptavidin (SA).\nDilute SA conjugates to a concentration of 50 ng/μL in staining buffer.\nMix SA conjugates (15 ng/ sample) with the respective biotinylated antigens at a molar ratio of 1:4 and add staining buffer according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. Mass ratios were calculated as 1:6 for SA/SARS-CoV-2-S1, 1:5 for SA/SARS-CoV-2-S2 and 1:2.2 for SA/SARS-CoV-2-RBD.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2239_3.csv\nIncubate for 60 min at 4°C and use the incubation time to thaw cryopreserved PBMCs.\nNote: As antigen-specific B cells are very rare, bright fluorophores are used for labeling of antigen probes. To exclude B cells binding to the respective fluorophores, each antigen is separately multimerized with SA labeled with two different fluorophores. Only double positive cells are classified as spike-specific. Note that only one fluorophore is used for the RBD, as it is part of the S1 subunit and can be plotted against one of the S1 antigen probes.\nAlternatives: In this step, the antigens can be exchanged to adjust the protocol to detect B cells specific to other variants of the spike protein or other antigens of SARS-CoV-2, as well as antigens of other pathogens. For adjustment to other SARS CoV-2 variants, the amounts of S1, S2, and RBD can be adopted from Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], as they have the same molecular weight. For different proteins, the mass ratio to be used for labeling with fluorophore-conjugated SA has to be calculated based on a molar ratio of 1:4 (SA: protein), as described above. If there is only one antigen of interest, the other antigen probes/ fluorophores can be excluded from the staining protocol.",
    "Thawing of cryopreserved PBMC\nTiming: 45 min, depending on number of samples\nIn this step, cryopreserved human PBMCs are thawed and counted for subsequent staining.\nPrepare a 15 mL conical tube with 9 mL of ice-cold staining buffer for each sample and cool down centrifuge to 4°C.\nThaw cells.\nPlace cryotube with frozen PBMCs in a 37°C water bath until partially thawed.\nRapidly transfer vial into sterile working bench and decant cells into 15 mL conical tube containing staining buffer.\nUse 1 mL of fresh staining buffer to collect remaining cells from cryotube and transfer them into the same 15 mL conical tube.\nCritical: Rapidly conduct steps 5a–c. Subsequently place samples on ice until continuation with step 6 to reduce toxicity of DMSO contained in the freezing medium.\nWash and count PBMCs.\nCentrifuge samples for 8 min at 600 g and 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells using a 200 μL pipette.\nFill tube up to 10 mL with ice-cold staining buffer and resuspend directly before counting.\nMix 20 μL of cell suspension with 20 μL of Trypan Blue, transfer 10 μL into counting slide and count cells manually or using an automated cell counter.\nCentrifuge samples for 8 min at 600 g and 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in a maximum volume of 200 μL of staining buffer.\nTransfer 5 to 10 million PBMCs to a 96 well V-bottom plate for staining.\nNote: This protocol was established for staining of 5–10 million PBMCs per sample, but can also be used for staining lower or higher amounts of cells. Note that lower cell numbers may reduce the sensitivity of the assay due to the low frequency of antigen-specific B cells within PBMCs.\nStaining of PBMCs for flow cytometric analysis\nTiming: 3 h",
    "This section describes the procedure of staining PBMCs for flow cytometric analysis and consists of three staining steps and subsequent fixation. At first, the PBMCs are stained with an amine-reactive dye for detection of dead cells, in combination with an Fc receptor (FcR) blocking reagent to prevent non-specific binding of antibodies via their Fc region. The subsequent staining of antigen-specific cells is performed using the antigen probes prepared in steps 1–3. Additionally, SA labeled with PE/Cy5.5 is added as a decoy probe to distinguish B cells specific to the spike antigens from those binding to SA. Brilliant Stain Buffer containing free d-biotin is used to minimize potential cross-reactivity between the antigen probes. In a third staining step, different surface markers are stained using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies, followed by fixation with the cross-linking agent paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nPrepare staining mixes 1 to 3 according to Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and store them at 2°C–8°C until needed.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2239_4.csv\nCritical: For staining mix 2, free biotin has to be added prior to the sequential addition of SA-labeled antigen probes. This way, any possible free binding sites of SA resulting from the individual labeling reactions are occupied by the free biotin before adding the next antigen probe.\nNote: Volumes are indicated for staining of a single sample and can be scaled up depending on sample number. Some excess volume should be included into staining mixes.\nPerform blocking of Fc receptors and staining of dead cells.\nCentrifuge samples in 96 well plate for 3 min at 500 g and 4°C.\nDecant supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 105 μL per well of staining mix 1 as prepared in step 8.\nIncubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nWash cells.\nAdd 100 μL of staining buffer and centrifuge samples for 3 min at 500 g and 4°C.\nDecant supernatant.",
    "Resuspend cells in 200 μL staining buffer and centrifuge for 3 min at 500 g and 4°C.\nDecant supernatant.\nPerform staining of antigen-specific B cells.\nResuspend cells in 55 μL of staining mix 2 as prepared in step 8.\nIncubate for 60 min at 4°C.\nWash cells as described in steps 10a–d.\nStain surface markers.\nResuspend cells in 135 μL of mix 3 as prepared in step 8.\nIncubate for 30 min at 4°C.\nWash cells as described in steps 10a–d.\nFix cells using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nResuspend cells in 100 μL of 4% PFA.\nIncubate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash cells as described in steps 10a–d.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL of staining buffer and store at 4°C until acquisition.\nCritical: For incubation steps and storage, samples and staining mixes should be placed in the dark, as the fluorophores are sensitive to light exposure.\nPause point: Samples can be acquired directly or stored at 4°C to be measured the next day.\nSingle stained controls for Cytek Aurora\nTiming: 90 min (or in parallel with regular staining protocol)",
    "This section describes the preparation of single stained reference controls, which have to be prepared for each fluorophore included in the assay. Reference controls are needed for unmixing of raw data files, as they define the signature of each fluorophore across the full emission spectrum. If possible, reference controls should be prepared using the same cell type and staining protocol as for the regular staining procedure. However, it might be more feasible to use compensation beads (e.g., UltraComp eBeads, Thermo Fisher) for antibodies directed against rare antigens, to obtain sufficient events in the fluorophore-positive population. To provide reference controls for the fluorophores used in the antigen probes, compensation beads can be coated with any biotinylated antibody of host species mouse, rat or hamster, and subsequently labeled with the respective fluorophore-conjugated SA. Staining of reference controls for dead cell stains can be performed on killed PBMCs (e.g., by heat shocking, as described below).\nNote: Reference controls only have to be prepared and acquired once and can then be saved and re-used for all subsequent measurements.\nKill PBMCs for dead cell stain reference control.\nTransfer approximately 2 million PBMCs into a 1.5 mL tube and incubate in the water bath at 65°C for 10 min.\nDistribute PBMCs and compensation beads in 96 well plate, as needed for reference controls (see Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]). Include two additional wells for unstained PBMCs and beads, respectively.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2239_5.csv\nKilled PBMCs: add approximately 2 million cells per well.\nPBMCs: add approximately 2 million cells per well.\nBeads: add one drop of beads per well.\nWash samples.\nFill up wells to approximately 200 μL with staining buffer.\nCentrifuge samples for 3 min at 500 g and 4°C.\nDiscard supernatant.\nPerform single stain of dead cells.\nDilute LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain 1:1000 in staining buffer.",
    "Add 100 μL of diluted fixable BLUE to killed PBMCs.\nAdd 100 μL of staining buffer to all other samples.\nResuspend samples and incubate for 15 min at 4°C.\nWash samples.\nAdd 100 μL of staining buffer and centrifuge samples for 3 min at 500 g and 4°C.\nDecant supernatant.\nResuspend samples in 200 μL staining buffer and centrifuge for 3 min at 500 g and 4°C.\nDecant supernatant.\nPerform single stains on PBMCs and beads according to Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\nResuspend all samples in 100 μL of staining buffer.\nPBMCs: add 2.5 μL of the respective antibody.\nBeads: add 1 μL of the respective antibody or 1 μL of biotinylated anti-IgG antibody plus 1 μL of fluorescently labeled SA.\nIncubate for 30 min at 4°C.\nAlternatives: Instead of biotinylated anti-IgG antibody, a biotinylated antibody directed against any antigen can be used, as the compensation beads capture any mouse, rat, or hamster antibody.\nWash samples as described in steps 22a–d.\nFix cells using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nResuspend cells in 100 μL of 4% PFA.\nResuspend beads in 100 μL of staining buffer.\nIncubate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nWash samples as described in steps 22a–d.\nResuspend samples in 100 μL of staining buffer and store at 4°C in the dark until acquisition.\nNote: Fixation with PFA is only required for cellular samples, and steps 25 to 26 may be skipped for the wells containing compensation beads. However, it may be more feasible to stain cells and beads in the same plate and to resuspend beads in staining buffer during fixation of cellular samples, as described above.\nAcquisition at Cytek Aurora\nTiming: 2–5 h, depending on number of samples\nWarm-up of lasers and running of Quality Control (QC): 60 min.\nSetting up experiment and reference controls: 30 min.",
    "Acquisition: approximately 5 min per sample.\nThis section describes the process of starting up the Cytek Aurora, setting up a new experiment and acquiring reference controls as well as samples.
