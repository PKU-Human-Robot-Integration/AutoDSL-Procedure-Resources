    "Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0001] describes the extraction of a single-cell suspension from different tissue of control and chronically inflamed mice (BCG model; described in detail in a Current Protocols article by Ben-Meir et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-bib-0010]). This protocol represents the starting point for the various applications described herein. Extraction of cells can be performed under sterile conditions, if required when used for tissue culture.\nThis protocol has been used successfully with high reproducibility.\nMaterials\n8- to 14-week-old C57BL/6 mouse\nErythrocyte lysis buffer (ELB; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-rec-0004])\nDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (e.g., Biological Industries, cat. no. 02-023-1A)\n70% ethanol\n0.4% trypan blue (e.g., Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Anesthetize and restrain mouse with one hand, grabbing the scruff of the neck between the thumb and index finger with mouse bottom secured by the little finger holding the tail.\n2. Insert 22-G needle caudal to the eye at the small freckle by the jawline with the other hand.\nInsert the needle only to the depth of the bevel.\n3. Collect required volume of blood into a 1.5-ml tube.\nFor serum preparation, collect into a regular polyethylene tube. For single-cell suspension, collect into anticoagulant-treated tubes such as EDTA tubes.",
    "For serum collection, substantial blood collection is required and can be done by other methods such as using a syringe and needle to collect blood from the venous sinus.\n4. Put mouse back in home cage.\nBleeding should cease immediately; if it does not, apply gentle pressure with a sterile gauze sponge.\n5. Let blood sit at room temperature for 30 min.\n6. Centrifuge 10 min at 1000 × g, 4°C, and carefully transfer upper phase into a new tube.\nBe careful not to transfer any blood clots when collecting the serum. The serum can be kept for a few days at 4°C or for longer-term storage at −20°C. It is recommended to prepare aliquots of the serum and to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nSingle-cell suspension for flow cytometry staining\n7. Transfer 100 μl blood into a 15-ml conical tube filled with ELB and close cap. Flip tube twice to homogenize blood in ELB.\n8. Centrifuge 8 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Discard most of the supernatant.\nIt is recommended to leave ∼100 μl in order to prevent loss of cells.\n9. Wash pellet with 1 ml DPBS, and centrifuge as described in step 8. Discard supernatant.\n10. Resuspend in 100 μl DPBS or volume appropriate for the pellet size.\nCells are now ready for flow cytometry staining following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0003].\nThe solution used for suspension at this stage could be different and should be chosen depending on the exact staining procedure.\nSingle-cell preparation from tissue\n11. Euthanize mouse for excision of the desired tissue.\nMouse euthanasia should follow the experimental procedures approved by the animal care authority of your institute. Tissue collection must be performed carefully without damaging organs.\nSplenocyte extraction",
    "12. Wet fur using 70% ethanol to prevent fur from sticking to the spleen. Remove spleen and place in a 6-cm culture dish with cold DPBS. Remove as much fat and connective tissue as possible. In case of hair adhesion to the spleen, rinse and replace DPBS.\n13. Homogenize spleen using the back of a 5-ml syringe plunger.\n14. Collect cell suspension into 15-ml conical tube, and rinse culture dish with new DPBS to collect remaining cells.\nLeave behind fat and connective tissue.\n15. Centrifuge 8 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\n16. Resuspend cell pellet with ELB, and immediately repeat step 15.\nDepending on the spleen size, resuspend accordingly with different volumes of ELB. For control mice with a spleen size below 0.10 g, resuspend with 5 to 7 ml ELB; for enlarged spleens above 0.20 g, use 10 to 13 ml ELB.\n17. Resuspend cell pellet in DPBS, and strain through a 70-μm mesh strainer into a new 15-ml conical tube.\nThe solution used for suspension at this stage could be different and should be chosen depending on the next procedure. For regular-sized spleens, resuspend with 5 to 7 ml solution; for enlarged spleens use 13 to 10 ml solution.\n18. Count cells using a hemocytometer and trypan blue.\nManually count cells with trypan blue using a laser-carved grid to evaluate the number of cells in a unit of volume (usually millions of cells per milliliter).\nTrypan blue stains dead cells faint blue, allowing for distinguishing live cells.",
    "Normally, a single, whole spleen from a control mouse between the ages of 8 and 14 weeks contains 40–70 × 106 total cells. Although it is suggested to use cells immediately after the generation of single-cell suspensions, cells can be stored in RPMI 1640 full medium at 4°C for up to 12 hr before use.\nCells are now ready for further use, such as for flow cytometry staining following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0003] for isolated MDSC phenotyping and for isolation of T cells (described in detail in a companion Current Protocols article by Reuven et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-bib-0010]). The concentration of cells should be adjusted for the desired protocol.\nBone marrow extraction\n19. Remove leg and expose femur and tibia by trimming excess tissue. Carefully remove both edges of the bone near the joint by rotating the scissors back and forth. Remove as much muscle and connective tissue as possible.\nExtracted bone marrow can stick to the remaining tissue and can be lost during isolation. Be cautious with the removal of inflamed bones, as they are fragile and tend to break easily.\n20. Extract bone marrow cells from bones: \n         \nPuncture bottom of a 0.5-ml tube with a 18-G needle. Place bone in tube with knee facing down and close cap.\nInclude a maximum of four bones per tube.\nPlace closed 0.5-ml tube inside an open 1.5-ml tube, and add 150 μl DPBS. Centrifuge 15 s at 10,000 × g, 4°C. Discard inner tube containing the bones.\nAt the bottom of the larger tube, a small cell pellet should be visible. For healthy mice, the cell pellet will be red, and the bone should be white. For inflamed mice, the cell pellet and bones should both be white.",
    "21. Fill 1-ml syringe with 25-G needle with DPBS, and insert into the trimmed edge of the bone. Hold bone with forceps above a 1.5-ml tube, and flush out cells by pushing the plunger down. Repump syringe with the cell suspension from the tube, and pass it through the bone a few more times until all cells are depleted from the bone. Centrifuge 8 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\n22. Resuspend pellet with 1 ml ELB, and centrifuge 8 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\n23. Resuspend cell pellet with 0.5 to 1.5 ml DPBS depending on the pellet size, and strain using mesh into a new 1.5-ml tube.\nThe solution used for suspension at this stage could be different and should be chosen depending on the next procedure. For example, RPMI 1640 medium can be used.\n24. Count cells using a hemocytometer and trypan blue.\nNormally, a single leg from a control mouse between the ages of 8 and 14 weeks contains 7–10 × 106 total cells. Although it is suggested to use cells immediately after the generation of single-cell suspensions, cells can be stored in RPMI 1640 full medium at 4°C for up to 12 hr before use.\nCells are now ready for further use, such as for flow cytometry staining following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0003] for MDSC phenotyping and Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0004] for M-MDSC isolation. The concentration of the cells should be adjusted for the desired protocol.",
    "Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0002] is optimized for the preparation of single-cell suspensions from melanoma tumors in mice, without the use of digestive enzymes such as trypsin. Although these enzymes are very efficient in the disruption of cell-to-cell contacts, they may damage leukocyte cell surface molecules used as cell surface markers when characterizing cells within the tumor microenvironment using monoclonal antibodies for flow cytometry or immunofluorescence analyses. However, to prepare a single-cell suspension of B16-F10 melanoma cells grown in tissue culture, a brief digestion with trypsin B is advised.\nThis protocol describes a simple method for inducing B16-F10 melanoma tumors in mice by transplanting cells subcutaneously. The tumors can be excised and used to generate single-cell suspensions for additional testing.\nMaterials\nB16-F10 cells (e.g., ATCC, cat. no.

Culture B16-F10 cells in DMEM until cell confluence reaches ∼80% in a 10-cm culture dish.\n2. Discard medium and wash cells with 10 ml DPBS supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) HI-FCS and 1 mM EDTA. Discard DPBS.",
    "3. Add 0.5 ml trypsin B to detach cells from the dish, and incubate for 3 min at 37°C.\n4. Wash cells with 10 ml DMEM, and collect in a 15-ml tube.\n5. Centrifuge tube 8 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\n6. Resuspend pellet with 5 ml DPBS supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) HI-FCS and 1 mM EDTA.\n7. Strain cells using a 40-μm cell strainer to generate a single-cell suspension.\n8. Count cells using a hemocytometer and trypan blue. Adjust cell concentration to 0.25 × 106 cells/ml using sterile DPBS supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) HI-FCS and 1 mM EDTA.\n9. Store cells at 4°C until injection. Strain cells with a 40-μm cell strainer before cell injection, as cells tends to aggregate.\nTumor cell injection\n10. Anesthetize mouse using an isoflurane anesthesia setup.\n11. Shave mouse fur at the flank using an electric shaver.\n12. Disinfect skin at the injection site using 70% ethanol.\n13. Inject 100 μl cell suspension (25 × 103 cells) subcutaneously into the mouse flank.\n14. Follow mice for tumor development daily, and using a caliper measure tumor development and growth.\nVisible tumors are expected to appear within 10 to 14 days after injection. Usually tumor size reaches the endpoint of the experiment 28 days after injection of tumor cells. An example of tumor growth kinetics over a period of 28 days is presented in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-fig-0001].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2bfbd698-3b27-471d-9a7c-0ea8bc40bcae/cpz1561-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nGrowth kinetics of mice injected with B16-F10 melanoma tumor cells over the course of 28 days. When injecting a small number of cells, tumors will appear about 10 to 14 days after injection, and at the endpoint there might be variability in tumor volume.\nExtraction of cells from tumors",
    "15. Euthanize mice and collect tumors. Transfer each tumor to a culture dish containing 5 ml DPBS supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) HI-FCS and 1 mM EDTA. Keep tumors intact with the surrounding skin.\n16. Dissociate tumor mechanically using scissors, scalpel, and forceps.\nThe dissociated tumor fragments should be small enough to fit through a 25-ml serological pipette.\nThis step is extremely important because many immune cells reside in the lymph vessels that surround the tumor; therefore mechanical dissociation promotes the release of cells.\n17. Insert 100-μm cell strainer into a new 50-ml conical tube, and transfer fragmented tumor and DPBS supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) HI-FCS and 1 mM EDTA onto the cell strainer using a 25-ml pipette.\n18. Using a 2- or 5-ml syringe plunger, mash tumors into the cell strainer, and wash with DPBS supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) HI-FCS and 1 mM EDTA. Repeat step until only the hard and undissociated tissue parts are left in the strainer.\nThe cells should flow through the strainer, whereas the skin and connective tissue fragments should stay on top.\nIn case of large tumors, overflowing of the tube with DPBS might occur. To avoid this, move the strainer to a second tube and continue.\n19. Centrifuge 50-ml tubes 10 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\nThe supernatant is expected to appear black due to the tumor cell–derived melanin.\n20. Resuspend tumor pellet in ELB.\nThe volume of ELB to be added depends on the size of the tumor and the number of red blood cells within the tube. Usually, 15 ml is enough for a 10 × 10–mm tumor. Pipette thoroughly until the pellet is suspended.\n21. Centrifuge 50-ml tubes 10 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.",
    "At this point, the supernatant may appear red due to lysis of erythrocytes.\n22. Resuspend tumor pellet in 20 ml DPBS supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) HI-FCS and 1 mM EDTA.\nCell aggregation is expected.\n23. Insert 70-μm cell strainer into a new 50 ml conical tube, and transfer 20 ml cell suspension through the cell strainer.\nThe number of cells expected from each gram of tumor is 100–200 × 106 total cells. Although it is suggested to use cells immediately after the generation of single-cell suspensions, cells can be stored in RPMI 1640 full medium at 4°C for up to ∼4 hr before use.\nCells are now ready for further use, such as for flow cytometry staining following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0003].

    "When conducting in vivo experiments using models of chronic inflammation, it is imperative to identify, track, and characterize MDSCs within the different tissue. The use of multicolor flow cytometry enables high-resolution analysis of the different MDSC subsets, according to specific cell surface markers. Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0003] describes a simple and efficient preparation of samples for flow cytometry.\nTable 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-tbl-0001] details panels designed to characterize mouse and human MDSCs based on the expression of cell surface markers using flow cytometry. This protocol is suited for staining single-cell suspensions prepared from mouse tissue such as bone marrow, spleen, blood, lymph nodes, or tumors, as well as biopsies or other tissue types. Detection of pan-MDSCs or of PMN-MDSCs and M-MDSCs is performed using antibody panels 1 and 2, respectively, in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-tbl-0001]. It is possible to add more markers to the panel for further subdivision of MDSC populations and for measurement of population-specific protein expression.

    "13. Analyze using a flow cytometer.\nWhen setting up the flow cytometer, make sure to get height (H), width (W), and area (A) parameters for side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) parameters. Note that some flow cytometers save W data for only FSC or SSC; in such cases use only one of them. These parameters will be used to discriminate cell doublets in the analysis (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7f24440c-0943-43cd-be84-032123e37df6/cpz1561-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nGeneral and mouse myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) reciprocal gating strategy.

All percentages of the gated cells are presented separately each plot.\nImageStream analysis of MDSC populations\nImage stream analysis using ImageStream software is a technique that couples flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy and enables distinguishing between MDSC subpopulations based on the expression of cell surface markers, morphology, nucleus structure, and cell size. Analysis of ImageStream data using the IDEAS software allows for using different algorithms to analyze the change in cell morphology, cell cycle, colocalization of molecules, and engulfing of extracellular particles.",
    "Steps 14 through 27 provide a simple method to use a prepared cell population (e.g., splenocytes or bone marrow as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0001]) for ImageStream analysis. It allows the analysis and visualization of cells in order to determine frequency of PMN- and M-MDSCs, as well as intermediate subpopulations. This method was used successfully to characterize the response of MDSCs to the presence of bacteria, as measured by altered cell morphology upon interaction and engulfment of the bacteria.\n14. Prepare splenocytes, bone marrow, or blood single-cell suspension as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0001].\n15. Count cells using a hemocytometer and trypan blue. Adjust concentration to 5 × 106 cells/ml.\n16. Divide 5 × 106 cells in 1.5-ml tubes for each treatment planned.\nMake enough samples to also include a single-stained sample; divide samples by the number of different fluorophores to be used in the experiment. Single stains will serve as compensation between channels on the ImageStream system.\n17. Centrifuge 8 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\nWhen centrifuging tubes in a centrifuge with fixed-bucket rotor, make sure to position tubes so that the lid will be toward the middle of the centrifuge to ensure the cell pellet will always be in the back of the tube. This will make aspiration of supernatant easier even if the pellet is hard to see, thus avoiding cell loss.\n18. Fix cells by suspending in 300 μl of 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in DPBS and incubating at 4°C for 15 min protected from light.\nLive (nonfixed) cells can also be used for the assay. A fixation step is required when intracellular staining is considered because intracellular staining requires a permeabilization step.",
    "19. Wash cells from fixation by adding 500 μl cold DPBS to each sample and repeating centrifugation as described in step 17.\n20. Stain cells using antibodies for cell surface markers. For single-stained samples, use only one fluorophore per sample.\nIf you wish to stain intracellular components, permeabilization should be performed before staining with antibodies (as described in step 22). Another option is to combine both cell surface and intracellular staining by adding another staining step after step 22.\n21. Wash cells from unbound antibody by adding 500 μl cold DPBS to each sample and repeating centrifugation as described in step 17.\n22. Permeabilize cells using 300 μl permeabilization buffer for 20 min in the dark at room temperature.\nPermeabilization is used to stain intracellular components of the cells, including DNA with DAPI as described in the next step.\n23. To visualize the cell nucleus, stain cells by suspending in 300 μl of 1 μg/ml DAPI in DPBS for 10 min at room temperature, protected from light.\n24. Strain cells through 40-μm mesh to ensure cells are in single-cell suspension.\n25. Centrifuge 8 min at 300 × g, 4°C. Discard supernatant.\n26. Suspend cells at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in DPBS.\n27. Read samples using the ImageStream machine. First read a sample containing all fluorophores used in your experiment. Adjust laser intensities, and make sure to read all samples with the same values so as not to bias results.",
    "The ImageStream cytometer combines the vast features of classical flow cytometry—including impartial analysis of large numbers of cells in a short period of time, which results in strong statistical data output—with essential features of fluorescence microscopy such as collecting real multiparameter images of analyzed objects. When staining single-cell suspensions extracted from tissue, as suggested in step 14, it is possible to visualize specific cells and associate them the surrounding cells while performing statistical analysis.\nGiemsa staining to assess cell maturity\nUnder normal conditions, MDSCs represent the progenitor cells for dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, whereas under chronic inflammation immature MDSCs leave the bone marrow and can be found in the periphery. The increased demand for myeloid cells during an inflammatory response leads to enhanced myelopoiesis that is indicative of inflammation severity. Giemsa staining solution contains the pigments methylene blue, azure, and eosin, which allows for the identification of different hematopoietic cells located in different tissue. This protocol provides a method to assess the maturity of the cells as an indication of an ongoing inflammation.\n28. Prepare single-cell suspension of splenocytes or bone marrow as described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-prot-0001].\n29.

Mark slides appropriately, and load into Cellspin machine. To do so, open the cellclip, and insert microscope slide with labeled side facing forward. Insert filter card and cell funnel, and fix assembly using the brackets. Then load assembly into the rotor.\n32. Load samples into the appropriate cell funnel, making sure that the correct sample is loaded on the appropriately marked slide.\n33. Set Cellspin machine to centrifuge 5 min at 100 × g, and start centrifugation.",
    "34. Disassemble and remove slides carefully from rotor.\n35. Incubate slides containing cells in 100% methanol for 5 min at room temperature, and let slides air dry for a few minutes.\nMethanol fixes and permeabilizes the cells, allowing Giemsa stain to penetrate into the cells.\n36. Prepare Giemsa staining solution by diluting 1 vol. Giemsa solution with 20 vol. deionized distilled water (1:20 dilution; 0.02% [w/v] final). Prepare enough staining solution to use 100 μl per slide.\nFor example, if staining four slides, prepare 400 μl Giemsa staining solution by mixing 20 μl Giemsa with 380 μl water.\n37. Stain slides for 20 to 40 min at room temperature using diluted Giemsa staining solution.\nStaining time may vary and should be optimized accordingly.\n38. Wash slides thoroughly in a Coplin jar containing 20 ml DPBS three times.\n39. Let slides air dry, and mount using xylene-based mounting solution by adding a small drop of mounting solution onto the sample and pressing a coverslip on gently. Allow slides to cure at room temperature for 30 min before inspection on a microscope.\nExample results are presented in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-fig-0003].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/09cc53fb-eb1f-43ab-86f8-a2161af70573/cpz1561-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nRepresentative results of control (A) and inflamed (B) total bone marrow cells stained with Giemsa.

    "Immunofluorescence analysis of tissue sections allows for the detection of cell distribution in vivo, as well as the assessment of interaction among different cells types. Accordingly, this protocol enables the assessment of MDSC distribution in vivo in different tissue such as the colon, spleen, and lymph nodes.

    "For tracking MDSCs in human blood samples, it is imperative to use whole blood samples containing all M and PMN cells. This protocol is designed for freezing, storing, and thawing human whole blood samples for later analyses.\nMaterials\nFreeze buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.561#cpz1561-rec-0006])\nIsopropyl alcohol, analytical grade (e.g., Frutarom, cat. no. 2355531200)\nRPMI 1640 full medium (see recipe)\nDPBS, without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (e.g., Biological Industries, cat. no. 02-023-1A) or FACS buffer (see recipe)\n4-ml sodium heparin–coated vacutainers (e.g., BD, cat. no. 367871)\n15-ml tubes\n1.8-ml screw cap cryotubes (e.g., Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 368632)\nFreezing container (e.g., Mr. Frosty Freezing Container; Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 5100-0001)\nCentrifuge with swinging bucket rotor compatible with 15-ml tubes\n37°C water bath\nLiquid nitrogen Dewar vapor phase storage tank (e.g., MVE cryosystem 4000 or equivalent)\nSmall liquid nitrogen–compatible container\nLong forceps\nFreezing whole blood\n1. Draw blood using vacuum tubes (vacutainers) coated with heparin for anticoagulation.\nBlood samples can be kept at room temperature in the dark for up to 24 hr before freezing. Neutrophils will not survive the thawing process for flow cytometry analysis.\n2. Assess total amount of blood to be frozen in each sample using a 5-ml pipette, and transfer each sample into a 15-ml tube.\nWrite down the volume of each sample you transfer to the 15-ml tube.\n3. Prepare and label cryotubes for aliquoting.\nNote that the whole blood will be diluted at a ratio of 1:1 with freeze buffer; for example, for an aliquot of 100 µl whole blood, 100 µl blood will be mixed with 100 µl freeze buffer.\nDo not exceed 250 µl whole blood in each aliquot as it takes longer to thaw and may damage the cells.",
    "4. Using a 5-ml pipette, add freeze buffer to each 15-ml tube containing blood at 1:1 ratio (blood:freeze buffer). Mix well and place on ice until aliquoting.\nFor a 4-ml sample of whole blood, mix with 4 ml freeze buffer in a 15-ml tube.\nThe volume of freeze buffer to be prepared should equal at least the same volume of total blood in all samples to be frozen.\nMake sure the freeze buffer is sterile and ice cold. Filter before use.\n5. Dispense aliquots to the labeled cryotubes using a pipettor and 1000-µl filter tips.\nUse filter tips to prevent contamination of the samples and pipettor.\n6. Keep aliquots on ice for 10 to 15 min.\n7. Prepare freezing container filled with isopropyl alcohol at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n8. Place aliquots inside freezing container at room temperature, and freeze at −80°C.\nAfter 48 hr the samples can be transferred to long-term storage in liquid nitrogen or kept at −80°C.\nThawing whole blood samples\n9.

Warm tubes with RPMI 1640 full medium to 37°C in a water bath.\nIt is imperative to work quickly to reduce exposure of the cells to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the freezing buffer. The large volume (15 ml) of warm culture medium dilutes the freeze buffer and provides good conditions for the thawed cells. Waiting for the entire sample to thaw before transferring to the 15-ml tube may damage the cells.\n12. Fill a small container with liquid nitrogen, and put frozen samples inside.\nWhen thawing several samples, it is important to provide similar conditions for each sample.",
    "13. Select a sample from the liquid nitrogen using long forceps, and take the correspondingly labeled 15-ml tube with warm RPMI 1640 full medium.\n14. Carefully uncap cryotube, and dispose cap in a biohazard-compatible container.\n15. With a 1000-µl pipettor and filter tip, draw 1 ml warm culture medium from the 15-ml tube.\n16. Without touching the frozen buffer in the cryotube, release warm medium to thaw the sample. Gently mix with slow up and down motions, avoiding bubbles. Transfer medium with thawed cells back to the 15-ml tube. Repeat this process several times until the entire sample is thawed and transferred to the 15-ml tube.\nWhen thawing several samples, keep the thawed samples in the 15-ml tubes at room temperature until all samples are thawed and before advancing to step 18 (works for up to 10 samples).\nWhen thawing samples, do not exceed >10 samples for each batch.\n17. Centrifuge samples 10 min at 300 × g, 25°C, to pellet cells. Discard supernatant.\nThe pellet may appear red owing to remaining erythrocytes.\n18. Resuspend thawed cells in room temperature DPBS or FACS buffer or in RPMI 1640 full medium if in vitro tissue culture assays are performed. Stain cells promptly.\nIf cell surface staining is desired, resuspend cells in FACS buffer. For intracellular staining, resuspend in DPBS.\nThe resuspension volume should equal the original whole blood volume in the sample. For example, for an aliquot of 250 µl whole blood (excluding freeze buffer), resuspend the pellet in 250 µl DPBS, FACS buffer, or RPMI 1640 full medium.",
