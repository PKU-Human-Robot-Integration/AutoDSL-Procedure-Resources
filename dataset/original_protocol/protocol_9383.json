    "1. Preparation of Reagents\nPrepare the PEMFA Buffer using 100mM Pipes, 2mM EGTA, and 1 mM MgSO4.  Adjust the pH of the buffer to 7.0.  The PEMFA buffer is filter sterilized and stored at 4°C.\nPrepare PBT by adding 1ml of Triton X-100 to 100ml 1x PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) (pH 7.0). Store at 4°C.\nPrepare 5% BSA (bovine serum albumin) with 0.01% NaAcide in 1x PBS (pH 7.0).\nPrepare the saline solution using 0.7% NaCl and 0.03% Triton X-100 in deionized water. \nPrepare the fixative by combining 4 parts PEMFA buffer with 1 part 37% Formaldehyde.\n2. Collection of Embryos\nPrepare a cage for the Drosophila strain of interest by placing >100 flies in a plastic bottle containing an adaptor with agar feeding plate.\nLeave the cage of flies in the dark at room temperature for 72 hours, changing plates every 8-12 hours, so that the flies get acclimated to the cage and do not hold their eggs.\nFor the experiment collect embryos for 12 hours. Remove the Petri dish from the container and replace it.  Take the removed Petri dish and wash the embryos off the dish using the saline solution and a clean paint brush.\nCollect the embryos in a fine sieve.  Rinse with saline to remove any excess yeast. \nUsing a spatula gently pick up the embryos and place them in a small glass vial with a cap.  Add about 1ml of saline solution.\n3. Removal of the Chorion and Vitelline Membranes and Fixation\nFollowing the collection of embryos, prepare the Heptane-Fix solution by combining 50% heptane and 50% fixative. The solution will be layered with heptane on top and the fixative on the bottom.",
    "In the glass vial wash the embryos by incubating them in the saline solution for 5 minutes. Remove excess saline using a Pasteur pipette. \nRinse the embryos with deionized water. \nDechorionate the embryos by incubating them in 50% bleach for 3 minutes. \nRinse the embryos thoroughly with deionized water. \nFix the embryos by incubating them for 30 minutes in the Heptane-Fix solution with gentle shaking.\nUsing a Pasteur pipette replace the fixative (bottom layer) with methanol leaving the heptane in the tube.  Shake vigorously to remove the vitelline membrane.  The devitellinized embryos will sink to the bottom of the tube. \nCollect the embryos in a new glass vial using a Pasteur pipette. Rinse the embryos five times with methanol, each time incubate the embryos for 5 minutes.\n4. Antibody Staining, Mounting, and Visualization\nRehydrate the embryos in a mixture of 50% PBT solution and 50% methanol for 5 minutes.  Then rehydrate in 100% PBT solution for 5 minutes. \nBlock the embryos by incubating them in 5% BSA with 0.01% NaAcide solution for 1 hour at 4°C. \nEmbryos are now ready for antibody staining. Prepare the primary antibody by diluting it to the appropriate concentration using 5%BSA with 0.01% NaAcide solution. We use an antibody against the cysteine string protein (CSP), a vesicular synaptic protein and an anti-HRP or horse radish peroxidase antibody, which recognizes a neuronal specific-carbohydrate moiety present in the surface glycoproteins and labels all neurons.\nIncubate the embryos overnight at 4°C in the primary antibody solution. \nThe following day, wash the embryos 10 times with PBT over the course of an hour. \nPrepare the secondary antibody solution by diluting the appropriate concentration.  We use Alexa secondary antibodies at a concentration of 1:200.\nIncubate the embryos for two hours in 4°C in the secondary antibody solution.",
    "Wash the embryos 10 times with PBT over the course of an hour. \nIncubate the embryos overnight in Vectashield Mounting Medium.\n Mount the embryos on a glass slide and seal the cover slip with nail polish. Visualize embryos using a fluorescence microscope.\n5.
