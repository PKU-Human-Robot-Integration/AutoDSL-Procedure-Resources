    "Ethics statement: This protocol is approved by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n1. Specimen Procurement\nCollect research tissue samples from surplus tumor and related normal tissue10-12. Store specimens on wet ice to avoid autolysis.\nSend all tissues, medical devices and foreign bodies removed during a surgical procedure to the Department of Pathology for necessary examination in order to facilitate a pathologic diagnosis.\nHandle tissue allocated for research in accordance with applicable research and tissue banking policies and procedures.\n\tNOTE: Biospecimen collection involves the coordination of pathologists, pathologists' assistants, histotechnologists and tissue procurement specialists.\n2. Pathology Quality Assurance (QA) \nComplete and verify patient records as an early QA measure and consult a pathologist to review diagnostic patient records (pathology reports, tissue slides, etc.) and tissue samples. Judge tissue samples on morphological characteristics of interest such as percentage of tumor, necrosis, tissue-tumor interface, etc. This is in accordance with biorepository best practices10-12.\nFollowing initial review, conduct periodic reviews of biorepository data and research samples during the entire length of stay of the biospecimen.\nLink results and annotations from histopathological and other investigations to the samples and provide this data to the researchers through a proprietary biorepository software system.  \n\tNOTE: QA processes ensure the integrity of both the clinical and technical aspects of biorepository operations.\nPerform genetic and molecular tests to verify and characterize the samples for clinical use.\nCollect and analyze data based on feedback from researchers who have been using the samples for laboratory experiments. Track samples using barcode technology. This electronic tracking system is also advocated in biorespository best practices10-12.\n3. Specimen/Tissue Processing",
    "Always store fresh tissue specimens on wet ice, and process as quickly as possible, in order to limit changes induced by extraction of the tissue sample from its natural environment. Process normal tumor-matched and tumor tissue samples separately to avoid cross-contamination.\n\tNOTE: Based on research protocols, biospecimen processing can involve collection of the specimens in one or more types of media.\nBefore beginning the process, prepare a sterile Petri culture dish, a scalpel, as well as a needle or forceps for tissue processing. Ensure that tubes have been prepared, labeled, and laid out in order to limit time of sample processing (Figure 2).\nAll relevant tissue information, such as patient name, number, treatment, date of surgery, and other relevant information as may be appropriate for the study, should be made readily accessible in an institutional tissue database. Limited patient information should be held in the lab in paper or spreadsheet form.\n\tNOTE: Only collect biospecimen information relevant to the nature of the research viz., basic biomedical research, clinical research, translational research, etc. For disease-specific information, the biorepository staff should collect data deemed necessary by the current literature and governing organizations to ensure proper diagnosis and meaningful research. This includes but is not limited to tumor grades and cancer staging information.\nPlan all desired subsequent experiments in advance, to decide on the size of tissue sections required for each type of analysis, as well as the location of excisions. Ideally, although impossible, all analyses should be representative of the entire tissue section in order to account for tissue heterogeneity and limit bias of downstream analyses. Lay out all required items in advance as depicted in Figure 2.\nPlace the tissue specimen in the open Petri culture dish, flat against the surface.",
    "NOTE: Allow only authorized biorepository staff to handle identified samples and to review identified health data. Investigators should access only those patient identifiers as allowed by the signed informed consents and as regulated by the IRB. All specimens must be adequately labeled and should include at minimum, a unique tissue identification number and tissue type. Do not include any PHI in the labels, in accordance with HIPAA regulations.\nInspect the sample from all angles, to gain a better understanding of its structure and dimensions. Pin the sample to the bottom of the dish with the needle, and proceed to bisect the tissue along its largest and best representative axis.\nCut out a small piece of tissue and place it in a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1ml of RNA-stabilizing solution. This sample can be placed on ice for the remainder of the process and stored at 4 °C until needed.\n\tNOTE: When working with RNA, gloves should always be worn, and RNAse-free filter tips should be used to limit chances of degradation and RNA contamination.\nLay out an open and pre-labeled biopsy cassette in the lid of the Petri culture dish. Cut out a slice of tissue no thicker than 3 to 5 mm and transfer it to the cassette. Place the cassette in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF) for a minimum of 72 hr. Transfer the cassette in 70% ethanol for long-term storage before paraffin-embedding.\n\tNOTE: Labeling of cassettes should be carried out in pencil or with recommended markers as use of xylene during processing will otherwise erase labels.",
    "Cut out a piece of tissue and place it in a tissue mold. Cover the tissue section in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, and freeze it immediately at -20 °C for cryosectioning. This tissue section may be stored at -20 °C until ready for cryosectioning.\nCut out one or many pieces of tissue and transfer them to a 50 ml tube containing MACS buffer (1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) for subsequent flow cytometry analysis. For flow cytometry, larger samples may be preferable as cells may be lost during tumor disassociation, cell fixation and permeabilization when required. Generally, this section may be taken at the end, once all other pieces have been processed. Leftover representative tumor sample may be used for flow cytometry. Optionally, this tube may be stored at 4 °C O/N or used for flow cytometric staining immediately following digestion into a cell suspension (see Step 4 - Flow Cytometric Staining).\nCut remainder of tissue into pieces no larger than a maximum size of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm and transfer them to cryogenic vials for immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen. These snap-frozen samples may be used for future analyses and collaborative purposes.\n\tNOTE: Extra care should be taken when working with liquid nitrogen as direct contact can cause severe injury. Eyes should be protected with safety glasses with side shields or with a face shield. Cryogenic gloves should also be worn to protect from liquid nitrogen burns caused by splashing and direct contact. Gloves should fit properly but be loose enough to be removed quickly should liquid nitrogen splash into them.\n4. Flow Cytometric Staining\nTissue Homogenization",
    "Prepare digestion medium with DMEM (40 ml), DNase I (50 U/ml) and Collagenase I (2 mg/ml). Place fresh or O/N-stored tumor in MACS buffer in the lid of a Petri dish, and submerge with digestion medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Different digestion methods exist, each with advantages (i.e., cell surface protein expression, viability). Ensure you have the proper method for your desired downstream application.\nPin tumor to the bottom of the dish with a needle, and cut from the outside to center with a scalpel, until the tumor has a paste-like texture. Transfer tumor mix to a 50 ml tube, seal and place in a plastic bag to avoid leaks. Transfer tube to an incubator, and rotate at 225 RPM, 37 °C, 1 hr.\nFilter tumor cell suspension through a 70µm cell strainer. Centrifuge cell suspension at 250 x g, 4 °C, 5 min. Resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml FACS buffer (500 ml PBS, 1 ml 0.5 M stock EDTA, 10 ml FCS or FBS).\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and re-suspend at a concentration of 1x107 cells/ml. Transfer 100 µl per well (106 cells) in a 96 well round bottom plate for staining.\nViability and Antibody Staining\nAdd 200 µl of viability stain solution to each well and mix. Incubate for 30 minutes, at 4 °C, in the dark. Spin down cells at 250 x g, 4 °C, 5 min, and aspirate supernatant.\nAdd antibody mixture at recommended/titrated concentration (as per manufacturer) for surface antigens in 200 µl of FACS buffer. Incubate cells at 4 °C, 30 min, in the dark. Spin down cells at 250 x g, 4 °C, 5 min, and aspirate supernatant.",
    "Wash with 200 µl of FACS buffer, spin down cells at 250 x g, 4 °C, 5 min, and aspirate supernatant. Resuspend cells in 200 µl of FACS buffer and proceed to flow cytometer for acquisition and analysis.\n\t\tNOTE : If performing intracellular flow cytometry staining, perform fixation and permeabilization steps and intracellular staining between steps 4.2.2 and 4.2.3. If performing cytokine staining, cells should be pre-activated preceding staining as recommended, and an inhibitor of intracellular protein transport and secretion such as monensin should be used during activation to ensure retention of soluble factors. Fixed cells may be stored short-term (one week) at 4 °C in the dark prior to acquisition on a flow cytometer.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
