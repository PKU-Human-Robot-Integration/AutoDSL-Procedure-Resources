    "Pea aphid rearing (Figure 1)Put the broad bean seeds into water for imbibing absorption of water adequately for 2 days.Remove the seeds peels gently.Plant one peeled seed about 1 cm depth in a seedling pot filled with soil matrix.The planted seeds grow in the growth chamber at 21 ± 1 °C and 70 ± 5% relative humidity under a 16-h light (L): 8-h dark (D) photoperiod.Seedlings with more than six leaves can be used.Place ten adult aphids on each seedling through clamping the tentacles with tweezers and allow to produce offspring in the growth chamber.Remove the adult aphids from the seedlings two days later.Rear the nymphs on the seedlings for nine days until they reach wingless adults.Use these newly emerged aphid adults to do the following experiments.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3862/bioprotoc-10-24-3862-g001.jpgFigure 1. Pea aphid rearing. Put the broad bean seeds into water for imbibing absorption of water adequately for 2 days (A and B). Plant one peeled seed about 1 cm depth into a seedling pot filled with soil matrix and then the seed sprouts (C). Place adult aphids on each seedling through clamping the tentacles with tweezers (D and E) and allow them to produce offsprings (F). Remove the adult aphids from the seedlings two days later and the nymphs grow into wingless adults nine days later (G).Bacterial infectionPrepare Luria-Bertani liquid medium, Luria-Bertani agar medium, 0.85% NaCl and sterilize these reagents in an autoclave.Streak culture the P. aeruginosa and M. luteus (keep in a ultra-cold storage freezer at -80 °C) on Luria-Bertani agar plates respectively in an incubator at 37 °C overnight.Pick a P. aeruginosa bacterial colony into a test tube containing 5 ml Luria-Bertani liquid medium and pick a M. luteus bacterial colony into a conical flask containing 100 ml Luria-Bertani liquid medium in a laminar flow cabinet.",
    "Culture the bacteria in a bed temperature incubator at 37 °C with the rotate speed at 220 r/min.Measure the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm on an Eppendorf biophotometer until the optical density reaches approximately 1 (Figure 2A).Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 8,000 x g for 10 min and resuspend the pellets in sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution and wash the bacteria three times with 0.85% NaCl solution through centrifugation and resuspension.Bring the P. aruginosa suspension to 2 x 109 colony formation units (CFU)/ml (Figure 2B) and M. luteus cell suspension to 2 x 1010 CFU/ml.Anesthetize the adult aphids on ice for ten minutes and prick through the abdominal wall into the hemocoel of the aphids about 0.5 mm deep with a capillary dipped in bacteria suspensions or sterilized 0.85% NaCl solution (Figures 2C and 2D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3862/bioprotoc-10-24-3862-g002.jpgFigure 2. Bacterial infection. Culture P. aeruginosa in a test tube containing 5 ml Luria-Bertani liquid medium until the optical density at 600 nm reach approximately 1 (A). Harvest the P. aeruginosa cells by centrifugation and resuspend the cells to 2 x 109 (CFU)/ml (B). Prick through the abdominal wall into the hemocoel of the aphids about 0.5 mm deep with a capillary dipped in the P. aeruginosa suspension (C and D).Hemocyte phagocytosis assaysAnesthetize the adult aphids in a sterile Petri dish on ice for 10 min.Remove one aphid legs gently with dissecting forceps and mixed the drops of hemolymph with a 5 μl Grace’s medium drop containing 1 μM phenylthiourea and 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS).Collect the hemolymph from 20 aphids per test group as above and mix the collected hemolymph well with 2 μl of 1mg/ml E. coli or S. aureus Alexa Fluor 594 BioParticles.Perform the operations of 5-14 steps in the dark.",
    "Transfer the prepared samples to tissue culture-treated round coverslips (8 mm diameter) in a 48-well cell culture plate.Allow the hemocytes to settle and adhere through incubating at room temperature for 1 h.Wash the coverslips twice with 200 μl hemolymph collection medium.Fix the washed hemocytes for 10 min with 200 μl 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.Wash the coverslips three times (10 min each) with 200 μl PBS.Permeabilize the hemocytes with 200 μl 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and wash twice with 200 μl PBS (10 min each).Incubate the permeabilized hemocytes with 200 μl diluted SF488 Phalloidin by 1:200 in PBS for 1 h.Wash the coverslips with 200 μl PBS three times (10 min each).Mount the coverslips on slides using anti-fading reagent (3 μl per coverslip).Observe and take photos under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Figure 3). The excitation and acquisition wavelengths of the bacteria were respectively 590 nm and 617 nm. The excitation and acquistion wavelengths of Phalloidin were respectively 495 nm and 519 nm.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3862/bioprotoc-10-24-3862-g003.jpgFigure 3. The confocal images of hemocytes with F-actin stained by SF-488 Phalloidin (A), E. coli AlexaFluo 594 BioParticles (B) and the overlay of hemocytes and E. coli.  Scale bars: 5 μm.Calculate the bacterial fluorescence intensities in phagocytosing hemocytes with ImageJ software (The calculation processes were shown as Figure 4).Take the phagocytic index (PI) as the phagocytic capacity of hemocytes according to a previous description (         Melcarne et al., 2019b).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3862/bioprotoc-10-24-3862-g004.jpgFigure 4. The calculation processes of the bacterial fluorescence intensities in phagocytosing hemocytes with ImageJ software. The image (the image is from Figure 3B) was loaded into ImageJ software (A). The phagocytizing bacteria were circled (B) and the bacteria outside of the hemocyte were cleared out (C). The image type was set as 8 bit and inverted (D).",
    "Adjusted the threshold and chose the “Default” options as “B&W” (black and white) (E). Got the analyzed result after set the measurements and the IntDen (integrated density) value was represented the fluorescence intensity (F)."
