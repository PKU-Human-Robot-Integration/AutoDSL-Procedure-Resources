    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation on the day of experiment\nTiming: 15 min\nIn this step, the solution preparation is described.\nPrepare 2 mg/mL Collagenase I solution in RPMI media.\nMake the Collagenase I solution by weighing 20 mg of collagenase and adding it to 10 mL RPMI.\nPrepare 5 mL of Collagenase I solution per mouse/graft. Keep Collagenase I solution on ice at all times to protect it from degradation.\nPrepare sorting buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS).\nPrepare 30 mL of sorting buffer per mouse/graft.\nMouse preparation\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this step, the mouse preparation is described.\nAnesthetize mouse with 1–2% isoflurane and assess anesthetic depth by a firm toe pinch using front toes (pedal reflex).\nPlace mouse on infrared heat pad for temperature regulation and apply sterile eye ointment before shaving to minimize the risk of introducing hair in the eye and drying of the eyes.\nShave and disinfect the surgical site with betadine swabs alternated with alcohol at least three times.\nMake a less than 1 cm incision on the back above the kidney to allow access to the organ. If necessary, free kidney from adhesion and fat by carefully cutting fat away from the kidney without damaging the kidney using micro dissecting scissors. Identify the graft (filmy white graft is visible on ventral side of left kidney – Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/825-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative images of SC-β-cells transplanted under the kidney capsule (image taken right after the injection)\nGraft collection\nTiming: 2–3 h\nIn this step, the graft collection and homogenization are described. After engraftment, the typical graft size of 5–12 month old ∼5 million cell transplantation is around 0.5 cm/0.2 inches and covers a small portion of the kidney as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/825-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Kidney grafts collected post-transplantation",
    "SC-β-cell graft is indicated by the arrow.\nEuthanize mouse by performing cardiac puncture if blood collection is needed or by giving lethal amount of isoflurane inhalant, 4% isoflurane, followed by cervical dislocation.\nTrim fat as closely as possible from kidney.\nRemove the kidney with the graft from the body.\nPlace kidney with graft in a petri dish that contains 5 mL of PBS to keep the graft hydrated.\nUsing a razor blade, dissect kidney into hemispheres and gently peel graft-containing capsule using forceps.\nSlice the graft into several small pieces by pulling apart using two plastic tips (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/825-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. SC-β-cell graft after being cut into small pieces (˜ 1 mm)\nCritical: Make sure you chop the graft into small pieces (approximately 1 mm) before proceeding to the next step.\nPlace the graft pieces into a 50 mL tube with 5 mL of Collagenase I solution. Keep it on ice until ready to proceed to the next step.\nCritical: This is an important step for survival of the cells. Make sure you proceed to the next step as soon as possible. We recommend not more than 20 min.\nIncubate the graft in a water bath at 37°C for 45 min. Vigorously shake or vortex every 15 min.\nNote: If after 45 min you still see a lot of graft not dissociated, incubate it for additional 10 min. We do not recommend incubating the graft longer than total of 55 min, it will cause decrease of cell viability.\nAfter incubation, breakup the tissue with a wide mouth pipette and filter the homogenized graft through a 200 μm cell strainer into a new 15 mL tube.",
    "Centrifuge the graft homogenate at 500 × g for 5 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet with 10 mL sorting buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS).\nHuman cell sorting\nTiming: 50 min\nIn this step, the cell suspension preparation and human fraction enrichment are described. All the steps in this section, including centrifugations, are performed at room temperature, 20°C–22°C, unless indicated otherwise.\nFilter the cell suspension from step 16 using a 37 μM filter and determine cell number using a manual or automatic cell counter.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 10 min. Aspirate supernatant completely.\nResuspend cell pellet in 80 μL of sorting buffer per 1 × 10⁷ total cells.\nAdd 20 μL of Mouse Cell Depletion Cocktail (Miltenyi, 130-104-694) per 1 × 10⁷ total cells.\nMix well and incubate for 15 min at 2°C–8°C.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 5 mL of sorting buffer and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\nAdjust volume to 500 μL using sorting buffer for up to 1 × 10⁷ total cells. Keep the cells at 20°C–22°C until ready to proceed to step 25.\nCritical: Up to 1×10⁷ cells can be processed on one LS Column. If more cells were used, split the sample into multiple LS Columns.\nProceed to magnetic separation.\nPlace column in the magnetic field of a QuadroMACS Separator (130-090-976).\nPrepare column by rinsing with 3 mL of sorting buffer. Wait until it stops dripping.\nPut a 15 mL tube under the column; this tube will be used to collect the unlabeled fraction of human cells.\nApply cell suspension (500 uL) onto the column. Collect flow-through containing unlabeled cells, representing the enriched human cells.",
    "Wash column twice with 1 mL of sorting buffer. Collect the unlabeled cells that pass though at the same tube.\nRemove column from the separator and place it in a new 15 mL collection tube, this tube will be used to collect magnetic labeled fraction of mouse cells. Pipette 3 mL of buffer onto the column. Immediately flush out the magnetically labeled mouse cells by firmly pushing the plunger into the column.\nNote: If one originally transplanted 5 million cells into the kidney capsule, on average one can recover 1–2 million human cells per mouse graft following transplantation for 5–12 months.\nQuality control staining\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this section, standard staining for quality control is described.\nNote: You can add antibodies of your choice for quality control assessment here if you would like.\nCritical: Perform staining on ice until the fixation step to protect cells from dying.\nCollect a small fraction (˜ 300 μL) of both the human and mouse final resuspension for quality control assessment and transfer each to new 1.5 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nAdd 100 μL of surface staining buffer (PBS + 2% FBS) to each tube and incubate for 30 min. This is the blocking step.\nNote: At this point you can transfer your samples to a round bottom 96-well plate. It is useful to do the staining in a plate if you have preparations from more than 5 grafts/mice.\nPrepare 100 μL of 2× concentrated surface staining antibody mix for each sample.\nFor one sample: Add the mouse lineage cocktail-PB antibody (biolegend 133310, dilution 1:50) + HLA-ABC-PE antibody (biolegend 311405, dilution 1:50) to 100 μL of surface staining buffer.",
    "Note: To calculate the volume needed, multiply the number of samples (n) plus 1 by 100. (n + 1) ∗100 = volume (μL) needed for staining. We use this calculation to account for pipette errors.\nAdd 100 μL of 2× concentrated surface staining antibody mix into each sample (from step 33) and incubate on ice for 45 min.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant, and add 200 μL of surface staining buffer. This is the wash.\nRepeat step 36 once.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant, and add 100 μL of cytofix/cytoperm buffer solution (BD 554714) in each sample for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C, discard the supernatant, and add 200 μL of perm/wash buffer (1×) (BD 554723) at 20°C–22°C.\nRepeat step 39 once.\nPause point: Store the samples 4°C for up 3 days or proceed to step 41\nIncubate for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nPrepare 200 μL of 2× concentrated intracellular staining antibody mix for each sample.\nFor one sample: Add the Rat anti-C-Peptide antibody (DSHB, GN-ID4, dilution 1:50) to 200 μL of surface staining buffer.\nNote: To calculate the volume needed, multiply the number of samples (n) plus 1 by 200. (n + 1) ∗200 = volume needed for staining. We use this calculation to account for pipette errors.\nAdd 200 μL of 2× concentrated intracellular staining antibody mix into each sample (from step 38) and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 1 h.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C, discard the supernatant, and add 200 μL of perm/wash buffer (1×) (BD 554723) at 20°C–22°C.\nRepeat step 44 once.",
    "Prepare 200 μL of 2× concentrated secondary antibody mix for each sample.\nFor one sample: Add the Donkey anti-Rat IgG Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher, A-21208, dilution 1:150) to 200 μL of surface staining buffer.\nNote: To calculate the volume needed, multiply the number of samples (n) plus 1 by 200. (n + 1) ∗200 = volume needed for staining. We use this calculation to account for pipette errors.\nAdd 200 μL of 2× concentrated secondary antibody mix into each sample (from step 44) and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C, discard the supernatant, and add 200 μL of perm/wash buffer (1×) (BD 554723) at 20°C–22°C.\nRepeat 49.\nProceed to flow cytometry analysis."
