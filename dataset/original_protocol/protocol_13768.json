    "The protocol of piezo-ICSI described below follows the guidelines of the human research ethics committee at Kameda Medical Center.\n1. Equipment and preparation\nUse a piezo-ICSI system composed of a drive unit, an operation box, a footswitch, and a controller. Use any type of inverted microscope or three-axis micromanipulator. Attach the piezo drive unit to the micropipette holder, and place the footswitch on the floor. Set the INTENSITY level to 2 and the SPEED level to 1 on the operation box.\nUse a commercially available piezo-ICSI micropipette with a flat tip. Fill a micropipette with the operation liquid (fluorocarbon-based fluid) to a length of 20 mm. Avoid mixing any air bubbles in the operation liquid. Aspirate any air bubbles or excess operation liquid towards the back of the pipette with the liquid filling device.\nInstall the micropipette into the injection micropipette holder. If the injection micropipette holder has a silicon tube, insert the head of the pipette about 5 mm into the silicon tube. Tighten the holder cap and firmly fix the micropipette.\nAttach the drive unit to the manipulator and fix firmly to avoid any rotation caused by its weight.\nPosition the micropipette in the microscope field. Operate the injector and push the operation liquid to the head of the micropipette so that any air inside the head of the pipette is pressed out. Confirm that there is no air left inside the head of the pipette with the naked eye rather than with a microscope.",
    "Prepare the ICSI dish on the glass-bottom dish as shown in Figure 1. Prepare two microdroplets of 7% polyvinylpyrrolidone solution (PVP): the smaller microdroplet is for the preparation of micropipette (5 µL) and the other one is for sperm selection (10 µL). Prepare another droplet made in the center of the glass-bottom dish from the buffered medium; this microdroplet is for the oocyte and is used for sperm injection (8 µL).\nInsert the head of the micropipette into a 7% PVP droplet and coat the inner wall of the micropipette. Operate the injector vigorously, moving it along the interfacial boundary between the operation liquid and the PVP. Rinse the inside of the micropipette with PVP about 800 µm from the head of the pipette.\n\t\nRepeat this procedure (~3 or 4 times) until the interfacial boundary slides smoothly.\n2. Sperm immobilization\nSet the INTENSITY level to 2 and the SPEED level to 1 on the operation box. Apply the piezo pulse from the drive unit attached to the micropipette holder when the footswitch is turned on. When applying the piezo pulse during the procedure, the \"Piezo pulse\" icon appears on the upper right of the video.\nCollect the motile sperm by using a density gradient and hold the collected motile sperm into the buffered medium. Aspirate the buffered medium holding the collected motile sperm about 2-3 µL by using a pipette. Then inject this medium into the lower side of the 7% PVP microdroplet. Select the sperm under 400x magnification.\n\t\nAttach the micropipette tip to the tail of the selected sperm and then drive the piezo drive unit. Typically, repeat the driving 3 times for one sperm immobilization. After the sperm immobilization, aspirate the sperm into the micropipette tail first.\n3. Piezo-ICSI operation (an oocyte with a high-stretching ability membrane)",
    "Keep the sperm's head at a position about one full length sperm back from the head of the micropipette. While driving the piezo drive unit (about 5 times per one oocyte), advance the micropipette to carry out the puncture without deformation of the zona pellucida. When the micropipette tip reaches the inner layer of the zona pellucida and then the hollowed-out piece of the zona pellucida is completely aspirated into the micropipette, puncture of the zona pellucida is completed.\nRemove the hollowed-out piece of the zona pellucida inside the micropipette and at the same time move the sperm to the head of the micropipette. Push the micropipette in and stretch the cytoplasmic membrane until about 90% of the oocyte diameter.\nWhen it is sufficiently stretched, start up the piezo drive one time to rupture the membrane. Membrane breakage is completed when it is confirmed that the membrane has rebounded.\nAfter membrane breakage, inject the sperm's head into the oocyte. After the sperm's head is surely injected into the cytoplasm, pay attention not to add unnecessary liquid.\n4. Piezo-ICSI operation (an oocyte with a low-stretching ability membrane)\nNOTE: We explain how to deal with an oocyte with a low-stretching ability membrane which may spontaneously get ruptured during the stretching.\nPerform the same action as the oocyte with a high-stretching ability membrane up to the point of stretching the cytoplasmic membrane.\nIf the membrane is spontaneously ruptured during the action, inject the sperm's head from the position of the micropipette without pushing it further forward to avoid the degeneration of oocytes after sperm injection.\nAfter the sperm's head is surely injected into the cytoplasm, pay attention not to add unnecessary liquid."
