    "Revival of Huh7.5 or Rep2a-Rluc (hepatocytes) cell linesRapidly thaw frozen Huh7.5 or Rep2a-Rluc cells (~1 ml) in a 37 °C water bath.Transfer entire content of Huh7.5 or Rep2a-Rluc cells into a sterile 50 ml conical tube and slowly add 10 ml of pre-warmed DMEM media containing 10% FBS and 100 U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin (complete media).Mix well, and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at RT.Discard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 5 ml of complete media and transfer to a T-25 cm2 culture flask.Incubate cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Observe culture flasks routinely under inverted microscope using 10x objective and split cells one day before the experiment.Note: Next day after revival, observe the culture flask for floating cells. If floating cells are seen, replace flask with fresh 5 ml of complete media. Hepatoma cells should be split in 1:3 to 1:5 ratio in every 3-5 days to maintain the cell growth.BODIPY labeling of exosomesSeed 2 x 106 Huh7.5 cells of ~50% confluency in a 100 mm plate and incubate at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator overnight. Next day, infect cells with HCV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Allow virus to adsorb onto the cells for 8 h in a minimum volume (2 ml) of DMEM with 2% of FBS and antibiotics. Wash the virus-infected cells 3 times with PBS.Note: Media with reduced serum concentration helps in virus infection. PBS should be kept at room temperature before use.Alternatively, seed 3-4 x 106 Rep2a-Rluc cells of ~80% confluency in a 100 mm plate and incubate cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator overnight. Next day, wash the cells 3 times with PBS.",
    "Dilute 10 μl of 1 mM of BODIPY 493/503 solution (see Recipes) to 10 ml of culture media to make the final concentration of 1 μM, mix well and add onto the virus infected Huh7.5 or Rep2a-Rluc cells.Incubate cells for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator.Wash the cells 3 times with PBS.Add 10 ml of fresh DMEM media with 2% of exosome depleted sera (see Recipes) onto the cells and incubate for either 3 days or 24 h for HCV infected Huh7.5 or Rep2a-Rluc cells respectively.After incubation, collect culture supernatant and proceed for exosomes isolation.Exosome isolation by ultracentrifugationCollect 10 ml of culture supernatant from HCV infected Huh7.5 or Rep2a-Rluc cells and centrifuge at 300 x g at 4 °C for 5 min. Without disturbing the cell pellet, carefully transfer the supernatant to a new ultra-clear centrifuge tube.To get rid of possible cell debris, centrifuge the supernatant at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by 26,500 x g for 30 min at 4 °C using SW41 Ti rotor by ultracentrifugation. Transfer the supernatant to a new ultra-clear centrifuge tube.Then, centrifuge the supernatant using SW41 Ti rotor at 110,000 x g for 90 min at 4 °C by ultracentrifugation to isolate the exosomes. Discard the supernatant.Wash the exosome pellet 2 times with PBS. For this, resuspend pellet in 10 ml of PBS and centrifuge at 110,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant. Repeat this step again.Resuspend the final pellet referred to as exosomes in PBS to 1/20 of the original volume of culture supernatant for analysis.Check the size distribution of exosomes by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments). Size distribution analysis of exosomes by DLS is shown in Figure 1.",
    "Exosome size is measured as diameter in nm (d. nm) and Polydispersity index (PDI) indicates size distribution of exosomes within the sample.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171129/20171129012536_2609.jpgFigure 1. Size distribution analysis of purified exosomes by DLS (Nano-ZS90, Malvern). Mean value from the intensity distribution, Z average is 202 nm and polydispersity index, PDI is 0.34.Exosome isolation by ExoQuick methodCollect 10 ml of culture supernatant from HCV infected Huh7.5 or Rep2a-Rluc cells.To get rid of possible cell debris, centrifuge at 3,000 x g at 4 °C for 15 min. Transfer the supernatant to a new 15 ml conical tube.Add ExoQuick at a ratio of 5:1 in the supernatant (5 ml of culture supernatant and 1 ml of ExoQuick), mix well and incubate overnight at 4 °C.Centrifuge the cell culture supernatant and ExoQuick mixture at 2,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Remove the residual supernatant and resuspend the final pellet referred to as exosomes in PBS for analysis.Uptake of BODIPY labeled exosomesGrow immortalized human hepatic stellate cell lines, LX2 in DMEM media containing 10% FBS and 100 U/ml of antibiotics (complete media).Pre-coat the 4-well chamber slides with poly-L-lysine (0.01%) for 1 h at 37 °C.Split LX2 cells and resuspend cell pellet in DMEM media supplemented with 2% exosome depleted FBS and antibiotics.Seed 1 x 104 LX2 cells in each well of 4-well chamber slides.Incubate cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator overnight.Next day, expose LX2 cells with BODIPY labeled exosomes for 3 h (short) or 24 h (long).Note: Exosomes should be diluted in serumfree media from 1:2 to 1:10 before adding onto LX2 cells. Do not add exosomes directly onto the cells. Since exosomes are resuspended in PBS, longer incubation of cells with exosomes will detach cells from chamber slides.",
    "To observe any changes at molecular level such as gene expression, exosomes should be incubated with recipient cells for a minimum of 24 h.After incubation, process LX2 cells for confocal microscopy to observe exosome internalization.Staining of cells for confocal microscopyFix the cells with fixation solution (3.7% formaldehyde, see Recipes) for 20 min at RT.Wash the cells 3 times with PBS.Permeabilize cells with permeabilization buffer (0.2% TritonX-100, see Recipes) for 5 min at RT.Wash the cells 3 times with PBS.Stain the cell nuclei with DAPI (1 µg/ml) for 2 min at RT (blue color) and observed under a confocal microscope. A representative image is shown in Figure 2A. For cell boundary or plasma membrane staining, incubate live LX2 cells with 5 µg/ml of Alexa Fluor-647 conjugated WGA (see Recipes) for 10 min at 37 °C.Wash the cells 2 times with HBSS.Fix the cells and follow the procedure as mentioned above. A representative image is shown in Figure 2B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171129/20171129012812_8587.jpgFigure 2.

LX2 cells are exposed with BODIPY labeled exosomes for 3 h. A. Immunofluorescence images showing uptake of BODIPY labeled exosomes (green color) and nuclei (blue color) by LX2 cells. B. Immunofluorescence images showing uptake of BODIPY labeled exosomes (green color), WGA (white color) to mark cell boundary and nuclei (blue color) by LX2 cells. The red arrow indicates BODIPY labeled exosomes inside the cell. The images are taken at 60x2 X magnification.Notes:  It is very hard to observe evenness of exosome labeling by microscopy. They are too small to be individually resolved. Generally, under microscope, BODIPY labeled exosomes tend to clump together.",
    "Exosomes size vary from 50-150 nm in diameter, however, high protein content in exosomes increases the size up to 200 nm in diameter.Two commonly used method for exosome isolation worked on different principles. Ultracentrifugation involves differential centrifugation. Successive rounds of centrifugation are intended to pellet down sequentially apoptotic bodies, cell debris, shedding vesicles and then, the exosomes are isolated based on size and density. It is a timeconsuming process involves multiple steps and potentially lead to exosomal aggregation. Exoquick method involves polymer based precipitation technique. There is a chance of contamination of exosomes with microvesicles and apoptotic bodies, however, exosomes can be isolated from very small amount of sample by this method."
