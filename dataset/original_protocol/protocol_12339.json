    "1. Reagents and Solutions\nPreparation of fly food and media\n\t\nHeat fly ingredients 11% sugar, 2% autolyzed yeast, 5.2% cornmeal, agar 0.79% w/v in water in a hotplate set at 90 °C. Stir regularly until a homogenous slightly dense mixture is obtained. Prepare a final volume of 550 ml of fly food for a total of 100 vials with 5 ml fly food in each.\nRemove from the heating source, stir occasionally until the food cools down to 80 °C and add 0.2% tegosept-methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate dissolved in 95% ethanol.\nSplit the food in two equal volumes. Add 1.1 ml of 50 mM rapamycin dissolved in ethanol to one volume and 1.1 ml of ethanol to the other volume. Stir the rapamycin and the ethanol solutions into the food. Be sure that the temperature decreases to 50 °C before adding drugs.\nIsolation Buffer\n\t\nPrepare 500 ml of Isolation Buffer [225 mM Mannitol, 75 mM Sucrose, 10 mM 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) , 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)] in water.\nAdjust the pH to 7.2 using sodium hydroxide. The initial pH will be acidic.\nUse sterile filter storage bottles with a 0.22 µm pore size to sterilize solution and store it at 4 °C.\nWash Buffer\n\t\nPrepare 500 ml of wash buffer [225 mM Mannitol, 75 mM Sucrose, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris HCl and 5 mM KH2PO4] in water.\nAdjust the pH to 7.2 using sodium hydroxide. The initial pH will be acidic.\nUse sterile filter storage bottles with a 0.22 µm pore size to sterilize solution and store it at 4 °C.\n2. Rearing of the Drosophila Strains",
    "To control larval density during development, place 25 pairs of parents in to a culture bottle and allow them to lay eggs for 48 hr.\nRemove parents after 48 hr to regulate egg density.\nRepeat steps 2.1 and 2.2 using the emerging F1 offspring, so two generations of this density control is achieved.\nTo collect adults, anesthetize the flies using carbon dioxide (CO2) and separate by sex.\n\t\nUse a single stage regulator to delivered pure CO2 from a high pressured tank at a continuous flow of 5 psi. To avoid static electricity, use plastic tubing to catalyze the CO2 into a 500 ml filtering flask with water.\nUse a rubber stopper with one hole to seal the flask. Use plastic tubing to connect the lateral aperture of the flask to a CO2 pad.\nPlace the flies in the pad for no more than 10-15 min. Allow to recover from anesthesia for 24 hr before placing them in experimental conditions.\nTo generate enough metabolites for mitochondrial enriched fractions, use 300 flies per sample. Here, use females, but gender may differ in other experiments. Transfer 150 flies to a homemade 1 L demography cage. Allow access to 5 ml of fly food in a vial.\nTransfer the remaining 150 flies to another 1 L cage. Do not overpopulate cages with more than 150 flies.\nUse six replicate samples per experimental condition. Since whole animal extracts yield more metabolites, to generate 1 sample of whole animal isolates, transfer 50 female flies to one cage. As for the mitochondrial isolates, use six replicate samples per experimental condition.\nPlace cages at 25 °C with cycle of 12 hr light and 12 hr dark.\nProvide fresh food every 2 or 3 days in a vial with 5 ml of food to maintain food quality.",
    "Maintain flies on food for 10 days. This step is needed for the rapamycin treatment7. Other treatments or conditions will differ.\n3. Isolation of Mitochondrial Fractions\nDump flies from one cage (150 flies) into a glass-teflon dounce homogenizer filled with 1 ml of chilled isolation buffer.\nHomogenize by moving the pestle up and down for 15 strokes. Keep the mortar on ice to keep mitochondria intact.\nTransfer homogenate to a 1.5 ml tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTake the supernatant and centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to enrich for mitochondria.\nAs the supernatant contains the cytosolic fraction, discard the supernatant or use it for alternative experiments. Resuspend the pellet in 300 µl of wash buffer.\nRepeat steps 3.1 - 3.5 for the second cage. Combine the resuspended pellets of both cages in a cryogenic microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 6,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and flash-freeze the pellet in liquid nitrogen.\nStore the mitochondrial enriched fractions at -80 °C or lower temperature.\n\t\nAlternatively, for whole animal preparation, place the adults in a cryogenic microcentrifuge tube. Flash-freeze the vial in liquid nitrogen and store adults at -80 °C or lower temperature.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
