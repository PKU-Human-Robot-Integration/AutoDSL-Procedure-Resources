    "1. Day Before Assay\nCollect flies into fresh food vials in groups of 11 (single sex) under brief (1-5 min) CO2.\nAllow flies to recover O/N in food vials in an environmentally controlled space (typically 25 °C, 60% relative humidity, 12 hr light/dark cycle).\nPrepare ethanol solution(s) by diluting pure (100%) ethanol in purified (≥18 MΩ) water to final concentration(s) appropriate for the planned experiment. Allow solution(s) to return to RT O/N.\n\tNote: Dilution of ethanol is exothermic.\n2. Day of Assay\nFor each vial of flies to be tested, prepare (i) a clean, empty food vial; i.e., testing vial, (ii) a new cellulose acetate plug, (iii) a silicone stopper and (iv) 1 ml of ethanol solution (see Table 3).\nPrepare testing room by adjusting temperature to 20-25 °C and relative humidity to 55-65%.\nHave another worker assign a unique code to each group of vials and record the code for later. Place coded vials with flies in testing room to acclimate for a few min.\nLabel empty testing vials to match codes on fly vials from 2.3.\nConstruct a hard copy testing log by entering the codes into columns (one column/vial) in a spreadsheet similar to Table 1.\nUsing the testing log as a guide, arrange coded food vials with flies and empty testing vials into matching arrays in the testing room.\n\tNote: A reasonable maximum number of vials to test is 24 (i.e., 6 sets of 4 vials each).\nTransfer flies from food vials into matched/labeled empty testing vials and immediately insert cellulose acetate plugs into testing vials until cellulose acetate plugs are 2 cm below the vial tops.\nHereafter, handle each row of four vials as a set at staggered 1 min intervals.",
    "For the time 0 assessment, grasp each vial individually with thumb and forefinger, tap gently on the table three times to knock flies to the bottom of the vial, wait 30 sec and then count the number of flies that are immobile/dead. Record the number of immobile/dead flies for each vial at time 0 min in the hardcopy testing log.\nStart timer counting up continuously at time 0 and immediately begin adding 1 ml of ethanol to cellulose acetate plugs in the vials for the first row/set of 4 vials. Add 1 ml of ethanol to the cellulose acetate plugs in the vials at 5 sec intervals in the order they will be tested. Add ethanol to the cellulose acetate plugs in a circular motion so that the ethanol is absorbed evenly throughout the cellulose acetate plugs. When ethanol has been added to all 4 testing vials in the set, insert a silicone plug in each vial to seal it.\nAt times 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min, add 1 ml of ethanol to the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth sets of 4 vials, respectively. Continue inserting silicone stoppers after adding ethanol to each set of 4 vials.\nAt time 6 min, test the first set of 4 vials by grasping each vial with thumb and forefinger, tapping gently on the table three times to knock flies to the bottom of the vial, waiting 30 sec and then counting and recording the total number of flies that are sedated. Score flies as sedated if they (i) stand on the floor of the vial but do not walk or (ii) lie on their backs with or without flapping their wings.\nHandle each vial within the set at 5 sec intervals using the schedule in Table 2.",
    "At times 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 min, test the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth sets of vials, respectively, as done for the first set.\nAt time 12 min, test the first set of 4 vials again as described in 2.12 and continue testing the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth sets of vials at 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 min, respectively.\nContinue testing flies as described in 2.12 until all flies are sedated.\nEnter the total number of flies in each vial in the hard copy testing log. Censor immobile/dead flies at time 0 from the total number of flies.\nCalculate the percent active flies at each assessment time-point and plot data as % active flies (y-axis) vs. time (x-axis). Quantitate ethanol sedation by interpolating Sedation Time 50 values (ST50, time to 50% sedation) from third-order polynomial or sigmoidal curve fits or calculating area under the curve.\nCompile data from decoded vials and perform statistical analyses (e.g., one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison test) as appropriate for the experimental design.\nSubscription Required.
