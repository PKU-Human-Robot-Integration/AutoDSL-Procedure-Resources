    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nTwo-Step Singleplex Assay\nTiming: 5.5 h post RNA extraction to results\nThe two-step singleplex assay first generates cDNA from RNA standards or RNA extracted from patient samples via an independent RT reaction. RT-generated cDNA is subsequently loaded onto a qRT-PCR machine and interrogated for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genes (here, nucleocapsid N1 and N2) and human RNase P (RP) as an internal control for extraction and sample stability. CT values for N1, N2, and RP are in turn used to make diagnostic decisions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nGeneration of cDNA from RNA (standards or patient samples)\nPrepare master mix for reverse transcriptase reaction in a microcentrifuge tube.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_184_3.csv\nMix by briefly pipetting or gently vortexing.\nPipette 5.8 μL of master mix into PCR strip tubes.\nAdd 14.2 μL RNA to respective PCR strip tube and gently mix by pipetting 5–10 times.\nNote: In order to control for potential contamination occurring during cDNA generation and eventual qPCR plating, a no template control (NTC) should be used. Here, the NTC is defined as nuclease-free H2O at 14.2 μL in place of RNA in the RT reaction.\nSpin PCR strip tubes briefly in a mini-centrifuge (e.g., Spectrafuge™ mini-centrifuge, Millipore Sigma, Cat. No. S7816) at 2,000 × g for approximately 10 s.\nInsert tubes into Mastercycler Nexus GX2 thermocycler and run the following program:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_184_4.csv\nPause Point: RT (reaction can be left at 4°C step in PCR machine 16–20 h). Moreover, cDNA can be kept at −20°C for long-term storage (e.g., months) or 4°C for short-term storage (e.g., 1 week).\nNewly generated cDNA is subsequently diluted by adding 40 μL nuclease-free H2O for a final total volume of 60 μL.",
    "Note: This volume allows for a patient sample’s cDNA to be re-run in the event of an inconclusive result.\nPreparation of master mix for qPCR and respective plate setup\nThaw 2× TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix on ice.\nNote: Once thawed, master mix can be stored at 4°C.\nThaw primer/probe set on ice, protected from light.\nMix Master Mix and primer/probes by inversion 5 times, then centrifuge for 5–10 s.\nLabel one microcentrifuge tube for each primer/probe set (i.e., three tubes total: N1, N2, and RP).\nDetermine the number of reactions (N) to set up per assay. For a standard curve of 5 concentrations with two replicates each, you will need 48 wells. Account for margin of error.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_184_5.csv\nNote: Technical duplicates are used for each sample and primer/probe set. For research purposes, as N1 and N2 transcripts are being probed for in separate wells, it may not be necessary to utilize technical duplicates – saving time and reagents while at the same time increasing sample throughput.\nPrepare the above mixture and mix by pipetting slowly up and down.\nIf mixed via gentle vortexing, centrifuge each reaction mix for 5–10 s.\nDispense 10 μL each master mix reaction into a 384-well plate.\nGently vortex and centrifuge all standard and any samples.\nAdd 5 μL each standard or sample to the 384-well plate containing the reaction mixture. In the two-step singleplex assay, 56 patient samples can be run per plate.

    "Note: Reactions reading a CT value of ≥40 are taken as negative. CT values below 40 are classified as positive. Be advised that in the assays described herein, a CT value <40 for RP is considered positive. Other FDA approved EUAs, utilizing similar qRT-PCR-based methodologies for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection, utilize a more stringent cutoff for this internal housekeeping gene (e.g., positive values are only considered if CT values are <35). If employing this cutoff, it is important to adjust the respective results interpretation table.\nNote: In an effort to limit the potential for errors in interpreting qRT-PCR results, the use of an automated results reporting script is highly recommended. To this end, please see our recently developed R script capable of importing and interpreting CT values from qRT-PCR of patient samples in an unbiased manner (available at https://github.com/TaylorMatte/Quant6-Covid_Analysis[href=https://github.com/TaylorMatte/Quant6-Covid_Analysis]). The R scripts included within this link contain comments which provide step-by-step instructions. Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] describes how to use this script to interpret singleplex assay results based on the diagnostic matrix outlined above in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].

Utilizing R Script for Automated Interpretation of qRT-PCR CT Values, Related to Figure 4 and Step 5\nThis video, coupled with annotated R script code (provided at https://github.com/TaylorMatte/Quant6-Covid_Analysis[href=https://github.com/TaylorMatte/Quant6-Covid_Analysis]) provides a step-by-step guide for automatically interpreting qRT-PCR results into diagnostic calls. It is important to perform an independent quality control check to determine the presence of spurious curves which may result in miscalling patient samples.\nOne-Step Singleplex Assay\nTiming: 3 h post RNA extraction to results\nThe one-step singleplex assay relies on a RT reaction programmed within the qPCR step. As with the two-step singleplex assay, the one-step platform assesses for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genes N1 and N2, with RP as an internal control for extraction and sample stability. CT values for N1, N2, and RP are subsequently interpreted using the identical matrix utilized for the two-step singleplex assay (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nReaction Master Mix and Plate Setup for qRT-PCR\nThaw 4× TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix and primer/probe sets on ice, protected from light.\nMix master mix reagent and primer/probes by inversion 5 times, then centrifuge for 5–10 s.\nLabel one microcentrifuge tube for each primer/probe set (i.e., three tubes in total, for N1, N2, and RP).\nDetermine the number of reactions (N) to set up per assay.

    "If mixed via gentle vortexing, centrifuge each reaction mix for 5–10 s.\nDispense 17.5 μL each master mix reaction into a 384-well plate.\nGently vortex and centrifuge each standard and any samples.\nAdd 2.5 μL each standard or samples to the 384-well plate containing the reaction mixture. In the one-step singleplex assay, 56 patient samples can be run per plate. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] depicts a sample plate layout for a full 384-well plate including standard curve, NTC, and positive and negative controls with technical duplicates – this is the same layout as the two-step singleplex assay, described above.\nNote: Use of an automated liquid handling robot (e.g., Biomek platforms, Beckman Coulter, Cat. No. A31841) or multichannel pipette (e.g., ThermoFisher, Cat. No. 4672100BT) can dramatically improve the efficiency and speed of this step.\nCover the loaded 384-well plate with adhesive cover and centrifuge the 384-well plate in a mini plate spinner (e.g., Labnet MPS 1000 Mini plate spinner, Millipore Sigma, Cat.

In the standard curve, RP assays should not show significant amplification.\nPlease see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for US CDC panel recommended interpretations for diagnostic reporting for the one-step singleplex assay.",
    "Note: As with the two-step singleplex assay, in this platform, reactions reading a CT value of ≥40 are taken as negative. CT values below 40 are classified as positive. As stated above, here we classify a CT value <40 for RP as positive. Other FDA approved EUAs utilizing similar qRT-PCR-based methodologies for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection utilize a more stringent cutoff for this internal housekeeping gene (e.g., positive values are only considered for CT values <35). If employing this cutoff, it is important to adjust the respective results interpretation table.\nOne-Step Multiplex Assay\nTiming: 3 h post RNA extraction to results\nThe one-step multiplex assay relies on a RT reaction programmed within the qPCR step. Unlike the previous assays, the one-step multiplex assay tests patient samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S, N, and ORF1ab genes. In place of RP as a control for RNA extraction and sample stability, this platform assesses the presence of MS2 transcript – a bacteriophage transcript not present in human or SARS-CoV-2 genomes. This depends on spiking in MS2 RNA into patient sample prior to RNA extraction (described in Before You Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section above). CT values for S, N, ORF1ab, and MS2 are subsequently interpreted using the diagnostic decision matrix in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_184_10.csv\nReaction Master Mix and Plate Setup for qRT-PCR\nThaw TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix (no ROX) (4×) and COVID-19 Real-Time PCR Assay Multiplex on ice, protected from light.\nMix master mix and COVID-19 Real-Time PCR Assay Multiplex reagents by inversion 5 times, then centrifuge for 5–10 s.\nDetermine the number of reactions (N) to set up per assay. For a standard curve with two replicates, you will need 14 wells. Account for margin of error.\nSee “One-step multiplex qPCR master mix recipe” below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_184_11.csv\nNote: Technical duplicates are used for each sample.",
    "Critical: For the one-step multiplex assay, utilize the RNA standards provided within the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit. Different synthetic RNAs may contain partial regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and therefore might not include the N, S, and ORF1ab sequences assayed for in the COVID-19 Real-Time PCR Assay Multiplex system.\nPrepare the above mixture and mix by pipetting slowly up and down.\nIf mixed via gentle vortexing, centrifuge each reaction mix for 5–10 s.\nDispense 20 μL master mix reaction into a 384-well plate.\nGently vortex and centrifuge each standard and any sample.\nAdd 5 μL each standard or sample to the 384-well plate containing the reaction mixture. In the one-step multiplex assay, 186 patient samples can be ran per plate.

    "Generate a standard curve for N, ORF1ab, and S. MS2 should be present at roughly equivalent amounts throughout all samples (not including standard curve) ran.\nPlease see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for US CDC panel recommended interpretations for diagnostic reporting for the one-step multiplex assay adapted from the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit manual.\nNote: Reactions reading a CT value of ≥40 are taken as negative.
