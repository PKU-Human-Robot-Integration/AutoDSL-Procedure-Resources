    "All experiments were completed in accordance and compliance with federal regulations and University of Iowa policy and procedures have been approved by the University of Iowa IACUC.\n1. Animals and husbandry\nUse adult mice of the desired mouse line at 8-10 weeks of age when the hair follicle stage is in telogen.\nOn the day of surgery, separate mice into clean cages and individually house to minimize wound disruption.\n2. Surgery\nNOTE: It is unnecessary to maintain sterile surgical conditions. While care should be taken to maintain sterility between animals, the punch biopsy itself is done on a clean, but nonsterile surface. The surgery duration per animal is between 10 and 15 min.\nAnesthetization\n\t\nAnesthetize the animal for 1-2 min in an induction chamber with the isoflurane vaporizer set to a 4-5% flow rate and the oxygen flow meter set at 1 liter per minute. See Discussion for alternative anesthesia options.\nConfirm proper anesthetization before beginning the procedure. The depth of anesthesia can be confirmed by a firm toe pinch.\nTransfer the mouse from the induction container to a nose cone and reduce the isoflurane flow rate to 1.5% and the oxygen flow meter to 0.5 L/min.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes as the procedure exceeds 5 min.\nMaintain normal body temperature using a thermal pad.\nPreparation of the wound site\n\t\nUse an electric razor clipper in a caudal rostral motion to remove the fur on the back of the mouse at the shoulder level. Remove hair lower on the back as needed if performing more than two wounds.\nRemove the remaining hair by using a razor blade in a rostral caudal motion held at 20˚ from the back of the mouse to closely shave the clipped area (Figure 1A).\nClean the shaved area with a povidone-iodine swab.",
    "Wipe the skin with a sterile 70% isopropyl alcohol prep pad to reduce potential cutaneous irritation from the iodine swab.\nWounding\n\t\nPinch the skin between the shoulder blades along the dorsal midline and pull the sandwiched skinfold away from the body (Figure 1B).\nPosition the mouse on its side with the skinfold on a flat surface draped with a clean paper-based towel or equivalent. Use a sheet of dental wax underneath the towel to protect the underlying surface from damage (Figure 1C).\nPlace the biopsy punch of desired size as close to the body as possible and allow the skin to relax. Do not stretch the skin, or the wound size will be larger than the designated punch size (Figure 1D).\nPunch the skin by pressing down, a rocking motion may be used to ensure all layers of the skin on both sides have been penetrated (Figure 1E). Use a new biopsy punch for each animal.\nRemove the punch biopsies from the wounds (Figure 1F). If there are still sites of attachment use sterile scissors and tweezers to free the punch from the surrounding skin. Process the punch biopsy control tissue as required based on downstream plans for wound healing analyses (see Discussion for suggestions).\nTake macroscopic photographs from an equal distance to the wound sites or with a ruler in the frame in order to measure the initial wound area and eliminate outliers from analysis.\nAdminister analgesia for a minimum of 24 h in accordance with an approved animal protocol. For example: Buprenorphine SR-LAB, injected as a single dose subcutaneously at 0.5-2 mg/kg for 48 h of pain relief (see Discussion for alternate suggestions and considerations).\nMonitor the mouse as it comes out of anesthesia until it maintains an upright posture and is walking normally around the cage.",
    "3. Post wound monitoring\nMonitor mice daily for experimental endpoints as determined by the investigator and in accordance and compliance with institutional protocols. Examples include: infection, visible weight loss, or a hunched posture.\nTake daily macroscopic photographs in a controlled manner as was done after the initial surgery.\n4. Harvesting wounds\nEuthanize mice at the desired time point post-wounding in accordance with an approved animal protocol.\nTake macroscopic photographs of the wound sites in a controlled manner consistent with previous photograph acquisition (Figure 2A,C).\nCut a wide rectangle around the wound sites using a scalpel (Figure 2D,E).\nFree the rectangular piece of tissue using scissors and tweezers to peel back and cut the skin away from the underlying tissue (Figure 2F).  Place in a Petri dish (Figure 2G).\nHarvest the wounds. Trim down to 2 mm of unwounded tissue surrounding all sides of the wound in a rectangular shape (Figure 2H,I). See Discussion for alternative options to harvest the wound.\nProcess the wounds as required for subsequent studies. Reserve at least one wound per mouse for paraffin embedding and histological analysis.\n5. Wound fixation and embedding\nFix the wound\n\t\nFix the wound tissue in a freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution8 for 3 h at room temperature then transfer to 4 ˚C overnight. Electron microscopy (EM) grade paraformaldehyde and solution filtration is not required.\nWash the wounds twice for 30 min in 1x PBS.\nReplace PBS with 70% ETOH and store at 4 ˚C until embedding. Process tissues within 24-48 h to avoid antigen loss or within 1-2 weeks if only evaluating histological characteristics.\nProcess and embed the wound\n\t\nTransfer each wound to an embedding cassette. Label embedding cassettes in pencil as the process will remove inks.",
    "Process the tissue either manually or using an automated processor by dehydrating the tissue with increasing ethanol percentages, clearing with xylene, and then infiltrating the tissue with paraffin wax (Table 1).\nEmbed the wound 90˚ (“standing”) from the horizontal surface of the embedding mold (Figure 3A,B).\n6. Day 0 wound area analysis\nDownload NIH-Image J or NIH-Fiji free software (https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads).\nOpen a file with a photograph of day 0 wounds.\nCheck the box for “Area” under Analyze | Set Measurements.\nSelect “Set Scale” under Analyze. Enter the distance in pixels, the known corresponding distance and the unit of the distance (= unit of length) if macroscopic measurements are part of the study or skip this step if only relative measurements are required.\nSelect “Freehand selections” on the Fiji toolbar.\nOutline the perimeter of the wound.\nClick Measure under Analyze.\nCreate a spreadsheet to keep track of the measurements per animal per wound.\nCopy the measurement of the wound area in the spreadsheet.\nCalculate the mean area and the standard deviation of all wounds for a given experiment.\nExclude any wounds outside two standard deviations of the mean from histological analysis.\n7. Serial sectioning\nChill the paraffin-embedded wound blocks at 4 ˚C overnight.\nInsert the paraffin block on the block holder of the microtome and orient so the blade will cut straight across the block. Orient the block such that the tissue “stands” at 90˚ allowing the simultaneous sectioning of the epidermis and dermis (Figure 3C,D).\nMake 2-4 ribbons of 20-30 paraffin sections of 7 µm each.\nUse a dry paint brush and a dissection teasing needle to transfer each ribbon to a firm yet manipulatable surface such as a firm black plastic sheet.\nDetach the top section of each ribbon with a razor blade and place on a microscope slide.",
    "Observe the unstained sections under a brightfield microscope to determine which ones contain wounded tissue, which can be identified by absence of hair follicle, changes in the appearance of the connective tissue or the epidermis, and/or the presence of a scab (Figure 4A,B).\nDiscard unwounded sections up to 20 sections before the beginning of the wound.\nSection through the wound by repeating steps 7.3 and 7.4 until no wound is detected in unstained sections.\n8. Mounting of paraffin sections\nSeparate paraffin sections every 5 sections with a razor blade, starting with the first ribbon (Figure 3E).\nLabel microscope slides with both the slide number and all the section numbers.\nGrab the group of 5 sections with a wet paint brush and float them on the surface of the water of a warm water bath (40-45 ˚C) to flatten them out.\nPick the group of 5 sections out of the water bath using one of the labelled microscope slides (Figure 3F) and place on a slide warmer set at 37 ˚C for up to 24 h.\nStore the slides upright in a slide box.\n9. Histological staining\nTransfer every 8th microscope slide (equivalent to every 40th paraffin section) to a staining rack and stain with hematoxylin and eosin.\n10. Microscopic imaging\nAcquire images using a bright field microscope equipped with a 4x objective and digital acquisition capabilities. Record the scale at which the image is taken.\nImage the entire wound of the top section of each stained slide and make sure to include some unwounded tissue on either side. Take multiple overlapping pictures if the wound is larger than the frame of a single picture.",
    "Save the file including the section number for morphometric analysis. Use the section number followed by a, b, c, etc. for overlapping pictures of the same wound.\n11. Morphometric analysis\nNOTE: When the wound spans multiple pictures, sum the measurements taken from the individual pictures to obtain one value per metric per wound section to record in the spreadsheet.\nIn Image J, open a digital file of a stained wound picture. Do not use stitched pictures for analysis. Perform measurements on zoomed-in overlapping pictures by finding landmarks to leave off and pick up measurements from picture to picture.\nSet the scale and measurement preferences.\n\t\nSelect “Set Scale” under Analyze. Enter the distance in pixels, the known corresponding distance and the unit of the distance (= unit of length). The scale should appear in the window and should correspond to the scale the image was acquired at.\nCheck the box “Global” to keep the scale the same for each open image.\nRepeat steps 11.2.1 to 11.2.2 every time Image J is closed and reopened.\nCheck the box for “Area” under Analyze | Set Measurements.\nMeasure the wound length\n\t\nSelect “Freehand selections” on the Fiji toolbar.\nMeasure starting from the last hair follicle of the uninjured tissue on one side of the wound to the first hair follicle of the uninjured tissue on the other side of the wound (Figure 4A,B).",
    "Trace along the dermo-epidermal junction to reach these two landmarks. If the epidermis does not cover the entire wound, follow the dermo-epidermal junction on one side of the wound and where the migrating tongue ends continue following the superior aspect of the granulation tissue or the junction between the granulation tissue and the scab until you reach the migrating tongue and then finally the first hair follicle of the uninjured tissue on the other side (Figure 4E,F).\nUnder Analyze, click Measure. The length of the measurement will appear in the same units as set in the scale.\nCreate a spreadsheet to keep track of the measurements (Supplementary Table 1).\nCopy the wound length into the spreadsheet.\nMeasure the epidermal length\n\t\nIf the epidermis covers the entire wound, the epidermal length is the same as the wound length.\n\t\t\nCopy the “wound length” measurement into the “epidermal length” column in the Excel spreadsheet and skip to step 11.5.\nIf the epidermis does not cover the entire wound, select the “Freehand selections” and measure the distance between each epidermal leading edge following the superior aspect of the granulation tissue or the junction between the granulation tissue and the scab to the first hair follicle (Figure 4C,D).\n\t\t\nUnder Analyze, click Measure.\nSubtract this measurement from the wound length and record the number under “epidermal length” in the Excel spreadsheet.\nMeasure the wound area\n\t\nSelect “Freehand selections” on the Fiji toolbar.\nMeasure starting from the last hair follicle of the uninjured tissue on one side of the wound to the first hair follicle of the uninjured tissue on the other side of the wound (Figure 4A,B,E,F).",
    "Trace along the superior aspect of the epidermis (do not include the scab) or the superior aspect of the granulation tissue if the wound is not fully covered by the epidermis.\nContinue to trace vertically along the hair follicle into the granulation tissue once the opposite hair follicle is reached and until adipose tissue or muscle is reached. Follow the inferior border of the granulation tissue to the opposite side of the wound and join the starting point along the hair follicle to close the area (Figure 4E,F).\nUnder Analyze, click Measure.\nCopy the wound area into the spreadsheet under “wound area measured.”\nMeasure the epidermal area\n\t\nSelect “Freehand selections” on the Fiji toolbar.\nIf the wound is fully epithelialized:\n\t\t\nTrace along the superior aspect of the epidermis until the opposite hair follicle is reached and complete the area by “returning” to the starting point following the dermo-epidermal junction between the epidermis and dermis (Figure 4D).\nUnder Analyze, click Measure.\nCopy the epidermal area into the Excel spreadsheet under “epidermal area measured” and skip to step 11.7.\nIf the wound is not fully epithelialized:\n\t\t\nTrace along the superior aspect of the epidermis until the leading edge and return to the starting point following the dermo-epidermal junction (Figure 4C).\nUnder Analyze, click Measure.\nRepeat step 11.6.3.1 and 11.6.3.2 on the opposite side of the wound.\nUnder Analyze, click Measure.\nSum the two numbers obtained in steps 11.6.3.2 and 11.6.3.4 and enter the result under “epidermal area measured” in the spreadsheet.\nRepeat steps 11.3 to 11.6 on every 40th section (every 8th slide).\nCalculate the epidermal area of the entire wound.\n\t\nCreate a new column in the spreadsheet “epidermal area calculated” next to “epidermal length.”",
    "Multiply the number for “epidermal length” by 280 for each section except the last one (7 µm thick section x 40 sections).\nMultiply the number for “epidermal length” by 7 for the last section (thickness of the section).\nSum the value of the “epidermal area calculated” for each section to obtain the epidermal area of the entire wound.\nCalculate the wound area of the entire wound.\n\t\nRepeat steps 11.8.1 to 11.8.4 using the wound length measurements.\nCalculate the epidermal volume of the entire wound.\n\t\nRepeat steps 11.8.1 to 11.8.4 using the “epidermal area measured” measurements.\nCalculate the wound volume of the entire wound.\n\t\nRepeat steps 11.8.1 to 11.8.4 using the “wound area measured” measurements.\nCalculate the percentage of epidermal volume in the wound.\n\t\nDivide the total epidermal volume by the total wound volume and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage (do not do this ratio for each section).\nCalculate the percentage of epidermal area among the wound area.\n\t\nDivide the total epidermal area by the total wound area and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage. If a wound is fully epithelialized, this number should be 100.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
