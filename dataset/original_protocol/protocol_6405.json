    "Seed sterilization (40 min)Place ca. 15 μl of seeds of reporter and control lines into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Generally, the aim is to have at least four-six biological replicates for each treatment and time point planned in the experiment.Add ca. 1.5 ml of the bleach solution.Incubate the seeds for ca. 30 min, agitating.Under sterile conditions, pipette out the bleach solution.Add sterile water to the seeds. Mix and pipette it out.Perform the wash with sterile water at least three times to wash out the leftovers of the bleach solution.Seeds can be vernalized either in the sterile water or as described in the Procesure C.Seed plating (40 min)Use 1 ml pipette to transfer single seeds onto a Petri dish with solid 0.5x MS medium. Keep ca. 2-5 mm distance between the seeds in the same row to avoid entanglement of roots. Keep ca. 5 cm distance between the rows (Figures 2A-2B). It is recommended to use a seed plating guide for this procedure (Figure 1, Figure 2A, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4016917[href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4016917]).Seal the plates with a strip of Parafilm or sealing film.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200227/20200227010843_1611.jpgFigure 2.

Scale bars = 1.5 cm (B-D); 50 µm (E, F).Vernalization (24-48 h)Incubate the plates in the dark at 4 °C for 24-48 h.Growth on vertical plates (5 days)Place the plates into growth conditions (150 µM light, 22 °C for 16 h, 0 µM light, 20 °C for 8 h). Make sure the plates are perfectly vertical to ensure root growth on the top of the medium (Figure 2B).Grow the seedlings on the plates for ca. 5 days, the root length should reach ca. 2 cm.Drug treatment (2-24 h)Pipette 3 ml of liquid 0.5x MS into wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate. Add the chemical compounds of the required concentration.Using soft forceps, gently pick seedlings from the plates and transfer into liquid 0.5x MS (not more than 20 seedlings/well).Gently pipette the medium from the well onto the seedlings in the well to submerge the roots (white arrow, Figure 2C).Seal the plate with a sealing film or as trip of Parafilm.Incubate the plate under the same growth conditions for the required amount of time.Mounting the samples (1 min)Pipette a drop of medium, ca. 50 μl, from a well on the 25 mm x 50 mm cover slip.Using soft forceps, gently pick seedlings from the well and place it onto the drop of medium making sure that the root is straight. Avoid drying the roots during transfer!Place up to six seedlings on the cover slip.",
    "Cover the roots with 25 mm x 25 mm cover slip (Figure 2D).Apply immersion if needed to the objective lens and place the sample on the microscope stage.Setting up scanning parameters for confocal laser microscopy (30 min, required only once)To estimate optimal range of settings for scanning, it is advisable to perform a pilot experiment using three control treatments with 500 nM AZD 8055 for 4 h, 500 nM ConA for 6 h and corresponding amount of vehicle (e.g., 0.05% DMSO).Configure settings for sequential scanning of two channels:Channel 1 for detection of mWasabi: excitation at 488 nm, emission detection range 490-564 nm.Channel 2 for detection of TagRFP: excitation at 561 nm, emission detection range 564-700 nm.It is advisable to use the most sensitive detectors available in the system (i.e., GaAsp or HyD detcors for Zeiss or Leica CLSM, respectively).Using 40x objective is advisable to obtain images most applicable for automated analysis.Set switching between channels for each frame to minimize the crosstalk between channels and optimize the pinhole size. If possible, use the pinhole of 1 AU for each of the channels.If possible, use 16-bit resolution to increase the resolution of intensities.The sample treated with AZD 8055 will have the weakest fluorescence and should be used to adjust laser intensity and the Detector Gain (Master Gain) to the lowest possible values that do not result in oversaturated pixels.The sample treated with ConA will have the strongest fluorescence, at least in the green channel, and should be used to re-adjust laser intensity and the Detector Gain (Master Gain) to the lowest possible values that do not result in oversaturated pixels.The sample treated with the DMSO can be used to verify the applicability of the adjusted settings.Additionally, noise can be decreased by ramping down the scanning speed or increasing the averaging number.",
    "In our experience, scanning at the speed of ca 10 seconds per frame produced images with the quality appropriate for further analysis while also resulting in acceptable time for experiment.Scanning (ca. 30 min per treatment)The assay is optimized for measurement of autophagic activity in the epidermal root cells. Downstream image analysis relies on automated detection of the vacuoles in the green fluorescent channel. Thus optimally, images should be made in the focal plane where in each cell vacuole is surrounded by clearly visible cytoplasm.Most CLSM software will have an option for scanning at selected positions that will significantly decrease the time required for the experiment.Mark the positions at the beginning of the differentiation zone of the root (Figure 2E).Start fast scanning mode (live scan) and readjust the focal plane for each position to the middle section through the vacuole of the epidermal cells (Figure 2F with and without cortical cytoplasm)When all positions are readjusted, acquire and save the images. Please note, that automated statistical analysis will use information provided in the names of images. Please use the following rules to introduce the required parameters into the name of your images:separate parameters by underscores (_)Name the files as follows: line_treatment_seedlingX_imageY (e.g., Reporter_50uM.C12_seedling1_image2.czi)Where line and treatment are text variables or strings identifying the lines (either “Reporter” or “Control”) and treatments (i.e., “50uM.C12”) used. One treatment must be named “Vehicle”. X and Y are numbers indicating seedling and image replicates thus representing biological and technical replicates, respectively. Note that “seedling” and “image” are fixed strings and only the numbers X and Y are changed from image to image."
