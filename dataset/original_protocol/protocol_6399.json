    "Behavioral tasks (both protocols are performed in the same behavioral room and all animals perform both tasks)Nesting Start the nesting protocol at 08:00 a.m., one hour before the dark phase (12-h light/12-h dark cycle). Place the animal into an individual cage filled only with wood-chip bedding (around 2 cm). After 60 min, place a cotton square (5 cm x 5 cm) on the bedding (Figure 2, see corner of the cage). Innately, animals use the cotton to build a nest. The following morning (08:00 a.m.), perform evaluation of nest.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218235040_3459.jpg Figure 2. Place an animal in an individual cage with wood-chip bedding following by a cotton square 60 min later (scale bar = 5 cm)Burrowing Place each animal in an individual cage (26 cm x 48 cm x 20 cm) with the burrow tube filled up with 200 g of food pellets (these pellets are standard mouse food pellets normally supplied as their diet). The animals have access to water, but no access to food other than the one placed in the tube.Start the test at 06:00 a.m., three hours before the dark phase. Record the amount of food pellets displaced after the first 2 h of the test.The weight of the pellets burrowed for 2 h is then quantify by subtracting it from the original 200 g. The burrow tube is refill with pellets, and the test continue. Perform the final quantification of the displaced pellet weight after 12 h, as shown in figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218151504_1325.jpgFigure 3. Plastic black tube with pellets displaced at time 0, 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.ElectrophysiologyPatch-clamp (ethics approval should be obtained)Deeply anesthetize the animals with pentobarbital (63 mg/kg, alternatives ketamine and xylazin) to perform an intravascular perfusion (30 ml) of modified aCSF bubbled with carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2).",
    "At the end of the infusion, decapitate the animal and remove the brain in ice-cold aCSF. To obtain para-sagittal slices (Figures 4 and 5), remove the cerebellum and brainstem, separate the brain hemispheres and glue them by their medial portion at a 30° angle (Figures 4 and 5). First, glue the brain to a piece of filter paper and then, glue the filter paper (with the brain) to the agar block (Figures 4 and 5, agar size tends to vary according to brain size). Throughout this process, the brain tissue should be immersed in normal aCSF with continuous bubbled with carbogen.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218151549_5616.jpgFigure 4. To obtain para-sagittal slices (see sagittal cut, red dotted line), separate the brain hemispheres and glue them by their medial portion at a 30° angle. First, glue the brain to a piece of filter paper and then, glue the filter paper (with the brain) to the agar block (see sagittal slice sequence). The agar block is glue to the adaptor tray (R = rostral, D = dorsal, C = caudal, V = ventral).Once the brain hemisphere is attached to the agar block, place the tissue in an adaptor tray submerged in ice-cold aCSF bubbled with carbogen. To obtain the parasagittal slices of the hippocampal formation (350-400 µm thick), couple the tray to a vibratome. Cut slices (dorsoventrally), and ventral slices containing hippocampus, 4-6 slices from each hemisphere (Figure 5). Immediately, transfer them into a nest beaker and incubate them for 1 h, at room temperature, with bubbled aCSF (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218151627_0109.jpgFigure 5. Sagittal slice sequence. With the razor blade, separate the brain hemispheres (A), glue the brain to a piece of filter paper (B) and then, glue the filter paper (with the brain) to the agar block (C to E).",
    "Finally, transfer the plate into the slicing chamber of the vibratome and lower the blade holder (F). Once the slice is freed, transfer it to the nest beaker with recovery aCSF.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218151659_6897.jpgFigure 6. Incubate sagittal slices in aCSF bubbled with carbogen at room temperature for at least one hour for recovery. The nest beaker could be prepared according to Papouin et al., 2018.After recovery, transfer the slices to the recording chamber located in a microscope equipped with optical components to perform Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) (Eclipse E600FN; Nikon, Melville, NY, Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218151732_4093.jpgFigure 7. Electrophysiology whole-cell patch-clamp set up and microscopeIn the recording chamber (Figures 8 and 9), place the slice in a well, which could contain up to 3 ml circulating aCSF bubbled with carbogen, at a temperature of 32 ± 0.5 °C. A total of 30 ml of aCSF continuously recirculate through the recording chamber at a flow rate of 17-20 ml/min (Figures 8 and 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218152009_0098.jpgFigure 8. Slice holder and recording chamber. The slice holder is made of a bent and flattened stainless-steel wire crossed by horizontal nylon fibers (around 3 mm apart). The recording chamber is made of acrylic (measuring length in centimeters, cm).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218152038_0054.jpgFigure 9. Mounting and holding the brain slice containing the hippocampus onto the recording chamber. The brain slice containing the hippocampal formation is placed onto the recording chamber and immobilized with the holder, leaving the recording area free for electrode location but fixed to maintain stable recording while the slice is perfused at high speed (17-20 ml/min).Perform recordings with glass pipettes (Warner Instruments, G150F-4; Handem, CT) made in a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). The electrode resistance is 2-5 MΩ. Fill pipettes with an internal solution.The visual patch-clamp technique is on the whole-cell configuration in the current clamp mode (Figure 10).",
    "The biological signals are measured through an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Always focus recordings on neurons located in the CA1 pyramidal area (CA1 has the least heterogeneous neuronal population and the pyramidal cells are arranged into well-defined layers, see Mondragón-Rodríguez et al., 2018a). Once the whole-cell configuration is achieved, hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses are applied to evaluate the intrinsic properties of the recorded neurons (Figures 10 and 11). During this current injection protocol, the neurons remained at the original resting potential (variable between neurons). However, the same protocol was repeated while the cells had a -70 mV membrane potential, which was achieved mostly by applying hyperpolarizing current (for whole-cell patch-clamp video see Sunstrum and Inoue, 2019).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218152107_9121.jpgFigure 10. Images of the CA1 pyramidal cell layer visualized through a differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope. The visual patch-clamp technique, in the whole-cell configuration, is achieved with pipette electrodes (highlighted with the dotted line) located on the cell’s soma (10x and 40x magnification on the left and right, respectively).Electrophysiological variables Resting membrane potential (trans-membrane voltage, Vm) is measured immediately after obtaining the whole-cell configuration.Fire frequency is measured as the number of action potentials (APs) generated by a neuron during a supra-threshold pulse of a one-second depolarizing current (Figure 11). To compare all neurons, the minimal depolarizing current injection required to evoke at least one AP (rheobase) is multiplied by two to quantify the frequency of the AP evoked by current injection.Fire frequency adaptation is calculated by dividing T2/T1, where T2 is the time between the last two APs of a train and T1 is the time elapsed between the first two APs of the same train.",
    "A value larger than one indicates adaptation of AP firing, whereas a value close to or less than one indicates no adaptation of AP firing or acceleration.Membrane resistance is measured using Ohm's law by dividing the change in voltage induced by the injected current. This measurement is performed for five hyperpolarizing current pulses.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218152153_7054.jpgFigure 11. Characterization of the evoked firing pattern of a recorded whole-cell neuron. Injecting a one-second, 30 pA depolarizing current pulse (lower trace) induced a train of action potentials (upper trace), which exhibit the adaptation phenomenon (reduction in firing frequency during steady stimulation).Subthreshold oscillationsTo characterize subthreshold oscillations, bring the membrane potential to the level just below the threshold to trigger APs (although sporadic potential can be induced). Keep the membrane potential at the value at which maximal amplitude subthreshold oscillations could be observed while triggering the least amount of APs as possible. Such voltage is represented in Figure 12.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218152227_6747.jpgFigure 12. Bring the membrane potential to the level just below the level where action potentials are triggered (see arrow)"
