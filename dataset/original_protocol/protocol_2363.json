    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnimal study: Animal experiment and plasma collection\nTiming: Approximately 20 weeks\nThis step describes HFD administration and blood sampling on mice, as well as plasma sample treatment and storage.\nRegularly record food intake and weigh animals every 2 weeks.\nFeed animals with HFD for the total period of 8 weeks, with 2 blood collection moments, each after a period of 4–5 h fasting. Blood should be collected:\nprior to commencing HFD.\nin the middle of HFD intervention, i.e., week 4.\nNote: The same fasting period is also applicable prior to sacrifice. It is necessary to standardize the fasting period during the entire study (e.g., consistently between 7-11 a.m.) to minimize diurnal lipid variation at blood collection.\nCollect tail blood samples using EDTA-coated tubes (Sarstedt, Germany) according to local regulations on research using animals, preferably at baseline (before starting HFD or at the age of 12 weeks) and then every 4 weeks (at 16 and 20 weeks of age). For lipidomic research, around 10 μL plasma (∼30 μL of blood) is required. Store tubes on ice and prepare EDTA plasma within 30 min.\nCritical: If possible, avoid or limit the use of anesthetic agents prior to plasma collections since some of these compounds might affect plasma lipids.\nCentrifuge those EDTA tubes at 4,000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C. Transfer out the supernatant (plasma) to Eppendorf tubes. Store at −70°C for subsequent lipidomic analyses.\nThe last EDTA plasma sample should be taken 1 day prior to sacrifice unless sufficient personnel are available to keep fasting plasma taken in strict and standardized procedure.\nAnimal study: Study of WAT histology and inflammation\nTiming: Approximately 10 days\nThis step elaborates on the mice sacrifice method as well as isolations and histological analyses of adipose tissue from different depots.",
    "Weigh animals and sacrifice them within 2–3 h (or at the same time in two consecutive days in the case of limited personnel) according to the local ethical policy and animal welfare regulations (e.g., using isoflurane, CO/CO2 as appropriate).\nIsolate organs of interest from cadavers, including epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT), inguinal subcutaneous WAT, and mesenteric WAT. Carefully weigh and record those different isolated depots of WAT.\nFix the isolated WAT depots in neutral buffered formalin (3.7% v/v formaldehyde) between 24–48 h.\nDehydrate the tissues by incubating them in increasing ethanol concentrations (e.g., 3 × 60 min 70%, 2 × 60 min 96%, 3 × 60 min 100%; v/v), then 2 × 60 min in 100% xylene, and finally 3 × 60 min in paraffin.\nEmbed the tissues in paraffin.\nPrepare 5-μm cross-sectional cold paraffin blocks using a microtome cutting machine and place them in a drop of water on microscope glasses. Place the glasses on a heating plate (37°C) and when most of the water has been evaporated, transfer the glasses into a cell culture incubator (37°C) for further air-drying.\nNote: Air-drying is critical to prevent adipose tissue disruption which can occur due to too long incubation on the heating plate.\nDeparaffinize the tissues with 2 × 2 min 100% xylene and rehydrate the cross-sections with decreasing ethanol concentrations (e.g., 1 min 50 s 100%, 10 s 96%, 10 s 70% v/v) and finally 3 × 5 min in 100% distilled water. Stain the cross-sections with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron (HPS) following this procedure: 8 min Safran, 5 min hematoxylin, 3 min phloxine, and 20 s distilled water between each solution. Repeat tissue dehydration protocol: 70%, 96%, 100% ethanol for 20 s each and 2 × 3 min xylene, then coverslip them.",
    "Take pictures at 20× magnification and perform a computer-assisted WAT cellularity (parameters: cell size and diameter as well as number of crown like structures), for instance using the open-source software Adiposoft (Galarraga et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nTo analyze tissue inflammation, randomly select 5 non-overlapping fields, distributed across the HPS-stained cross-sections. Afterward, quantify the number of crown-like structures (CLS), defined as circular structures formed by inflammatory cells around adipocytes.\nAnimal study: Lipid profiling in mice\nTiming: Approximately 3 days\nThis step explains lipidomic experiment and analysis in mice using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS).\n10 μL of plasma (sample) is extracted with 2-propanol containing internal standards (IS). The obtained extracts are analyzed for neutral lipids by UPLC-HRMS method using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in positive mode. In each series, an external calibration curve consisting of several representative compounds can be produced to quantify the compounds detected in the sample. Since standards are not available for every single compound detected in plasma, standards with the most structural resemblance are used in this protocol, assuming the response factors are equal. If desired, samples can also be analyzed relative to each other without any external calibrators. An estimate of the concentration of detected neutral lipid compounds can be made using IS. In this case, more IS should be used, preferably one for each class. The concentration of each IS should be adjusted to the range of expected concentration of the lipids. If specific lipid class of interest is composed of many lipids in very different concentrations, two IS per class can be used to estimate low and high concentration levels without exceeding the linear range of the detection.",
    "Note: Lipid extraction with organic solvents is usually the first step towards lipidomic analysis. However, standard method for lipid extraction from biological samples has not been established yet. The common practice usually involves phase separation between immiscible solvents, with lipids partitioned into hydrophobic phase i.e., traditional chloroform-methanol extraction. However, rather than employing this traditional method, this protocol uses an intermediate solvent (2-propanol) that has no phase separation to extract the neutral lipid fraction from plasma. This method has several advantages: 1) sample preparation is much faster and easier compared to the traditional method, 2) neutral lipids are recovered from the aqueous matrix (such as plasma), and 3) the solvents are inexpensive and less toxic.\nNote: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is commonly used in lipidomic analysis to separate lipids prior to mass analysis. Therefore, the vast majority of lipidomic studies use coupled and targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative mode. However, since only neutral lipids are analyzed, this protocol employs untargeted UPLC-HRMS with APCI in positive ionization mode. The employed full-scan acquisition mode provides adequate sensitivity to semi-quantify the main neutral lipids present in plasma, i.e., mono, di-, and triglycerides, cholesterol, cholesterol-esters, and ceramides. Although LC-MS/MS.\nNote: The differences in the extraction step recoveries can be partially corrected by the use of lipid class-specific IS. But, due to different fatty acid chain lengths and saturation degree, such standards cannot fully account for different extraction behavior within lipid subclasses. Nevertheless, these differences are usually negligible in the extraction process.\nThaw samples at 20°C–22°C and homogenize\nPrepare IS working solution (used for protein precipitation and lipids extraction from plasma) in 2-propanol containing two IS (C51:0 TG 2 μg/mL and C17:0 ChE 25 μg/mL).\nMake stock solution C51:0 TG (1 mg/mL).",

    "Note: Keep extracts at 20°C–22°C because triglycerides will precipitate at low temperatures.

If this is not feasible, quality controls can be obtained from the same type of sample (e.g., plasma) and ideally from the same species (in this case should be from the same mouse model) available on stock will be used for quality control.\nTwo types of quality control samples will be prepared: A and B. A is QC sample for monitoring the system stability and therefore a larger volume of QC A sample will be extracted, aliquoted into vials, and stored at < −18°C until analysis. QC A will be added to each analyzed batch of sample, minimum 2 times, see also Sequence. B is QC sample for monitoring batch-to-batch differences during sample preparation. These samples will be aliquoted before the extraction and stored at < −18°C. A minimum of 2 QC B samples will be added to each batch of samples, see also Sequence.

    "Neutral lipids are separated on a Waters Acquity BEH phenyl column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm; T = 60°C) using a mobile phase gradient from 40% mobile phase A [5% methanol in 10 mM NH4Ac] to 100% mobile phase B (100% methanol containing 2 mM NH4Ac) in 13 min with a flow of 0.4 mL/min. Mass detection is carried out using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in the positive mode. Injection volume is 2 μL.\nThe ultra-performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) system consists of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system coupled on-line in series to a quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive, Thermo Electron Corporation, Bremen, Germany). The equipment is controlled using Thermo Fisher Scientific Xcalibur™ v 4.1 Foundation 3.1 SP4 software.\nData processing is performed using XCalibur software (v4.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with target lipids and their accurate masses listed in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1998-Mmc1.pdf].\nLipid mapping onto lipid metabolism pathways\nTiming: Approximately 1 day\nThis step describes the mapping of lipid species captured from animal experiments onto common lipid metabolism pathways shared across species.\nMap the candidate lipid biomarkers found from the animal study onto lipid metabolism pathways (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1998-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Lipid metabolism pathways\nNote: Although lipids and lipid metabolism differ across species, many lipid metabolism processes are evolutionarily conserved and thus could be still comparable between species, e.g., de novo lipogenesis, hepatic triacylglycerols formation, or fatty acid catabolism. Of note, species differences should be still considered carefully, especially regarding the activity and allosteric regulation of the enzymes involved. The lipid moieties, however, are still comparable and the conversion of omega-3, omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids depicted in the desaturase framework in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] (Olga et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) apply to both human and mouse fatty acids.",
    "Note: Since the fatty acid conversions that are enzymatically catalyzed by desaturases (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) occur in both humans and mice, ratio of the fatty acid used as substrate (educt) and the resulting fatty acid product that is formed provides a measure for desaturase activity (i.e., desaturase activity index). As desaturases catalyze several reactions and use several fatty acids as substrate, desaturase activity index of enzyme can be calculated in several different ways.\nNote: Desaturase activity indexes should ideally be calculated from the same lipid class. However, if translational studies are conducted using different methods, alternative ratios/calculations can be employed. For instance, in our study (Olga et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]); since mouse and human lipidomics were using different platforms and human sample was obtained through the least invasive method possible (i.e., heel prick among infants) resulting in limited amount of sample in dried blood spots, SCD-1 activity index was calculated from cholesteryl esters in mice and from both cholesteryl esters and phosphatidylcholines in humans.\nHuman study in an established infant cohort\nAfter mapping the candidate lipid biomarkers onto the corresponding lipid metabolism pathways, the next step is to validate these findings in a longitudinal infant cohort. However, there are practical considerations that limit such investigative studies of metabolic programming in infants, mainly due to ethics and difficult sample collections in small infants. Therefore, although plasma is the ideal sample for lipidomic experiments, dried blood spot obtained from heel-prick is more preferable in infants since the method is less invasive and thus can increase compliance and number of samples. Moreover, this method has also been validated and is evidenced to be able to provide sufficient materials for lipidomic analyses (Koulman et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Prentice et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Acharjee et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nHuman study: Longitudinal anthropometry measurement",
    "Timing: throughout the study period; each time of physical measurement takes about ∼90 min\nSince the outcome of the study is weight/adiposity gain, in particular during early life, this step sets out the conduction of a prospective infant human cohort with multiple visits to measure longitudinal growth and body composition parameters, including weight, height, and skinfold thicknesses (SFT).\nNote: Study design must be thoroughly explained to potential study participants before informed consent to minimize the possibility of dropping out before completing the study.\nInfant anthropometry measurement should be performed by pediatric research nurses, properly trained by an anthropometry expert.\nTo ensure the quality of data produced:\nEach infant clinic visit should be scheduled based on the exact age of infants with +7 days tolerance for birth, 2-, and 6-weeks visits, and +28 days for 3 months onward. If possible, record birth weight from the medical/hospital records.\nRegular machine calibration and personnel training should be conducted periodically.\nData cleaning has to be applied in all anthropometric measurements prior to statistical analyses to exclude any implausible and invalid data values (e.g., 0.37 kg instead of 3.7 kg of birth weight).\nMeasure infant weight to the nearest 1 g using Seca 757 electronic baby scale (Hamburg, Germany).\nNote: Infants are weighed nude without nappies, or alternatively the weight of the diaper can be subtracted from the resulting weight. Weight measurement should be made before feeding.\nMeasure infant supine length to the nearest 0.1 cm using Seca 416 infantometer (Hamburg, Germany).\nNote: Standing height was measured using a stadiometer if subjects could stand without assistance, typically from 2 years old onwards.\nCritical: Measurement of length/height should be strictly performed without foot- and headwear.\nUse weight and length/height measurements to calculate body mass index (BMI) by dividing weight by the square of length/height.",
    "Measure SFT at multiple sites in triplicate on the left-hand side of the body using a Holtain Tanner/Whitehouse Skinfold Caliper (Holtain Ltd, Crymych, Wales, UK), e.g., in 4 sites: triceps (at the posterior surface of the arm, halfway between the acromial process or shoulder and the olecranon or elbow), subscapular (at the oblique angle below the scapula or upper back), flank (in the posterior axillary line immediately posterior to the iliac crest), and quadriceps (in the midline and halfway between the top of the patella and the inguinal crease).\nNote: SFT reflect subcutaneous fat folds and can be used to assess subcutaneous fat at various regions of the body or summed to estimate relative total body fatness (Diet, Anthropometry and Physical Activity (DAPA) Measurement Toolkit, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nHuman study: Dried blood spot collection in infants\nTiming: throughout the study period; each time of sample collection requires ∼30 min\nThis step focuses on collecting, treating, and storing dried blood spots obtained from heel prick as the least invasive blood sampling method in infants.\nPerform heel-prick in infants and record their last feed.\nNote: Since fasting prior to sample collection can be considered unethical for an infant study, recording the time and type of last feed is critical. These data can then be covariates to adjust for in data analyses.\nDrop bloods onto Whatman™ 903® untreated filter paper (Ahlstrom 226, ID Biological Systems), similar to the method employed in the UK newborn routine screening program.\nNote: Ensure that the blood goes through the back of the paper to maximize the amount of captured biological materials.\nAir-dry the samples at 20°C–22°C for 16–24 h.\nStore the samples at −20°C or −80°C (preferably −80°C).\nNote: Use uniform temperature throughout to avoid results dissimilarities due to temperature differences.",
    "At the time of lipid profiling analysis, punch out a single aliquot spot with diameter ∼3.2 mm from the larger DBS spots.\nHuman study: Lipid profiling in human samples\nTiming: Approximately 5 days, depending on the number of samples\nThis step describes the whole process of lipid profiling analysis from human dried blood spots and the steps of lipidomic data processing.\nEach experiment should be conducted with blank controls, 2 different quality control samples (mixed anonymized adult human venous blood samples and commercially available horse blood), and 6 IS (0.6 μM 1,2-Di-O-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline, 1,2 μM 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 0.6 μM C8-ceramide, 0.6 μM N-heptadecanoyl-D-erythro-sphingosylphosphorylcholine, 6.2 μM undecanoic acid, 0.6 μM trilaurin). The experiment begins by eluting the punched-out 3.2 mm DBS in methanol containing those 6 IS in 1.2 mL cryovials. This process results in lipids being partitioned into methyl tertiary butyl ether. Then, samples are centrifuged at 4,000 rcf for 10 min to get the organic layer (that will be used for lipid analysis) separated. Afterward, infuse samples into a Thermo Exactive benchtop orbitrap (Hemel Hampstead UK) using an Advion Triversa Nanomate (Ithaca US) and acquire data from both positive (+1.2 kV) and negative (-1.5 kV) modes. Data obtained from this procedure will be in semi-quantitative form or as signal intensity of each lipid expressed relative to the total lipid signal acquired for each individual per thousand (0/00).\nLipids extraction.\nNote: The automated method for the extraction of lipids is developed using an Anachem Flexus automated liquid handler (Anachem, Milton Keynes, UK).\nPlace in total 80 dried blood spot samples, 4 blanks, 8 QC1 and 4 QC2 as 3.2 mm diameter discs in 1.2 mL Cryovials, which shall then be placed in the wells of a glass-coated 2.4 mL deep well plate (Plate+™, ESSLAB, Hadleigh, UK).",
