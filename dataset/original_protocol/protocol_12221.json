    "This study was approved by the Laurentian University Research Ethics Board. Only participants for whom informed parents signed the consent form participated.\n1. Setting\nAssess participants in a private room if possible.\nIn order to reduce the impact of possible fatigue on the cognitive and navigational scores, it is not recommended to administer all of the tests at one time, instead, assess the participants over two to four sessions that vary from 30 min to 2 hr each.\nWhen using this procedure for research purposes, to control for the element of test practice on subtests that were last given, randomly determine the order in which the navigational task and cognitive subtests are administered, and ensure that they are not the same for all participants.\n2. Procedure\nNavigational Task\n\t\nMaterials: Use a computerized tablet and an augmentative and alternative communication application with a 16-location grid and taxonomic categorization. Use the symbols that come preloaded with the augmentative and alternative communication application. Use the navigational task that involves the retrieval of 25 words (see Table 1) and 5 practice words before beginning the formal assessment. Use a booklet that contains the symbols for each of the target words. Note: Each symbol is present alone on one page.\n\t\ttable:\n﻿0\nWords From the Practice Portion\n1. foot\n2. banana\n3. cat\n4. boat\n5. fork\nWords From the Formal Navigational Task\n1. dog\n2. hand\n3. apple\n4. car\n5. spoon\n6. frog\n7. shoes\n8. mouth\n9. fish\n10. carrot\n11. chair\n12. flower\n13. duck\n14. table\n15. boy\n16. airplane\n17. turtle\n18. cookie\n19. baby\n20. belt\n21. tree\n22. bus\n23. pencil\n24. farmer\n25. bicycle\nTable 1: Words from the Navigational Task.",
    "Sit/stand at an angle, across from the participant in order to observe if they can select the appropriate symbols on the computerized tablet, and to facilitate turning the pages of the booklet. Place the computerized tablet directly in front of the participant, flat on the table or at a 45° angle to control the reflection from the lighting in the room. Place the booklet upright using an easel with the symbols between yourself and the participant.\nAsk the participant if they have previously used a smartphone or a computerized tablet. Note: This variable is only important if this method is being used for research.\nExplain that symbols can be found under folders representing categories, that the home button links to the first level and that the back button links to the previous level. State: “The symbols can be found in each of the different folders that represent different categories (point to the different folders). This button over here (touch the home button) links to this level (demonstrate for the participant) and this button over here (touch the back button) links to the previous level. See?”\nPresent in a booklet, alone on one page, the symbols that need to be found in the tablet. Say the words that represent the symbols aloud.\nKeep the booklet open while the participant navigates within the levels of the computerized tablet to find the symbols.\nGive as many verbal and physical prompts as needed during the practice portion, for example: “What category does this word belong to?”\nBegin the formal navigational task after the 5 practice words have been successfully retrieved.\nTouch the home button on the application between trials in order to consistently start from the first level.",
    "Ask the participant to retrieve all 25 words within the levels of the computerized tablet using the same procedure as the practice portion, with the exception that prompts are not given.\nIf a symbol cannot be retrieved, tell the participant that by turning the page of the image booklet, the item can be skipped.\nScore items as correct if the participant correctly selects the symbol that matches the target in the booklet.\nGive a score of zero when a symbol is incorrectly retrieved.\nWhen the participant does not make a selection within 5 minutes, remind the participant that by turning the page of the symbol booklet, that item can be skipped.\nEnd the test once all of the 25 items are presented or after the participant reaches the ceiling of failing to retrieve 8 consecutive symbols.\nCognitive Tests\n\t\nAdminister the following subtests of the Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (Leiter-R)3 according to the instruction manual. For each subtest, after providing the non-verbal instructions, monitor the participant and record the number of correct responses. Note: The Leiter-R is a non-verbal test that requires the participant and clinician to communicate only with non-verbal cues such as pantomime, gestures, pointing and a questioning manner. The tasks on the Leiter-R generally involve a pointing or matching response. Materials include stimulus easels, cards, and foam shapes.\n\t\t\nAdminister the Attention Sustained subtest.\n\t\t\t\nPoint back and forth between the target picture and one correct answer on the page and simulate a crossing out motion to indicate to the participant the need to find and cross out as many items as possible that are identical to the target within an array of geometric shapes, within a time limit of 30 to 60 sec3.\nAdminister the Picture Context subtest.",
    "Use pantomime to indicate to the participant that the stimulus card relates to an empty box on the easel illustration3. Gesture back and forth to indicate the need to identify a pictured object that has been removed from a large display by using contextual cues3.\nAdminister the Figure Ground subtest.\n\t\t\t\nPoint back and forth between stimuli material and the easel and shrug in a questioning manner to indicate to the participant the need to identify embedded figures or designs presented on a card within a complex stimulus3.\nAdminister the Sequential Order subtest.\n\t\t\t\nGesture back and forth between stimuli material and tray slots to indicate to the participant the need to select a related stimuli that progresses in a corresponding order. For example, place shapes or cards in the wrong order and shake head “no”3."
