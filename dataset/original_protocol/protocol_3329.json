    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nObtainment of tumor tissue blocks\nTiming: 2–3 weeks\nTiming: 1 h (for steps 16–22)\nThis section describes how to obtain the tumor tissue-blocks from the subcutaneous tumor or patient-derived tissues for orthotopic transplantation.\nHarvest luciferase labeled OC cells\nNote: For patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, steps 1 to 19 can be skipped.\nExpand the OC cells labeled with luciferase in complete DMEM/F12 medium.\nNote: ES2 and ID8 cells labeled with luciferase are cultured in complete DMEM/F12 medium. Different cells prefer different media.\nFor inoculation, collect the OC cells at 80%–90% confluence.\nPrewarm the culture medium, PBS and trypsin-EDTA solution at room temperature for 30 min before operation.\nRemove the medium in the culture dishes and gently rinse the cells with PBS.\nAdd 2 mL trypsin-EDTA solution and gently shake the flasks. Allow enzymatic reaction for 30 s–60 s.\nCritical: Optimize the enzymatic reaction time for each cell lines to reduce the influence of digestion on the cell viability.\nAdd 2 mL complete medium, gently suspend the cells. Mix all cell suspensions up in a new centrifuge tube.\nCalculate the total number of cells: Total = cell concentration (determined by a cell counter after 0.4% trypan blue staining) × volume. After a 300 × g centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min, discard the supernatant and obtain the cell pellet.\nWash the cells with PBS, resuspend the cells with 1 mL serum-free medium and calculate the total number of viable cells.\nDilute the cell suspension with serum-free medium to the concentration of 1–3 × 107/mL in a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nCritical: Keep the tube on ice during transportation to maintain the viability of cells. Inoculate the mice within 1 hour.\nSubcutaneous inoculation and tumor growth",
    "Note: The subcutaneous tumor serves as the donor of the tumor tissue blocks for subsequent orthotopic transplantation. For the tumor derived from OC cell lines and the primary cells of OC patients, steps 10 to 19 should be conducted. For the PDX derived from the solid tumor tissues of OC patients, these steps can be skipped.\nSterilize all materials and equipment using 75% ethanol and a 30 min ultraviolet irradiation in a superclean bench.\nNote: This step can be carried out at the same time as harvesting the OC cells\nInhale the suspension into the syringe, 150 μL (1.5–4.5 × 106 cells) each time. Mix the cell suspension before each extraction.\nDisinfect the scapular area of the mouse skin with 75% ethanol and wait for the ethanol to dry out.\nInject the cell suspension subcutaneously.\nNote: Successful injection will generate a skin bulge in the inoculation area.\nNote: For most human OC cell lines, BALB/c Nude mice are used for inoculation. For ID8 cells, C57BL/6N mice are used for inoculation. For PDX derived from the primary cells and cell lines with poor tumorigenicity, mice with higher levels of immunodeficiency should be used, such as NOD-SCIDs, NSG, etc.\nCritical: Ensure that there is no fluid leak out.\nReturn the mice to their original cages if they do not exhibit any significant discomfort.\nUse a slide caliper to measure the tumor diameters when subcutaneous tumors can be observed. Calculate the tumor volume as Volume = length × width × width / 2. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nNote: For subcutaneous tumors, a suitable volume of the tumor is 0.5 cm3.\nCritical: We recommend to use two mice for individual cell line in this step to ensure that enough tissue blocks can be obtained for the following steps.",
    "Dissociation of subcutaneous tumors and preparation of tumor tissue blocks for orthotopic transplantation model\nNote: Tissue blocks can be acquired from subcutaneous tumors derived from OC cell lines or the primary cells of OC patients, or directly from the surgical specimens of tumor tissues from OC patients.\nWhen the volume of subcutaneous tumor reaches approximately 0.5 cm3, euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia.\nPlace the mouse in a prone position and disinfect the mouse skin with 75% ethanol.\nLift and cut the skin in the middle line of the tumor surface.\nDissociate the tumor from the mouse and place it in sterile PBS solution at 4°C.\nCritical: If transplantations cannot be started immediately, the tumor from subcutaneous model or the tissue from OC patient should be kept in pre-cooled serum-free culture medium at 4°C, and the tissue blocks should be transplanted to mice within 24 hours.\nRemove the tumor capsule with forceps and scissors, and wash the tumor with cold PBS three times.\nCheck the tumor carefully to identify the tumor tissue sections with better vitality (tissues without bleeding or necrosis).\nObtain 3-4 pieces of tumor tissue from these sections.\nPlace them into a new dish containing fresh cold PBS.\nNote: As the central area of tumor is usually more likely to be necrotic due to an insufficient supply of blood and oxygen, the solid tissues located in the peripheral regions generally tend to be more active.\nCut the selected tumor tissues into small tissue-blocks with a maximum diameter of no more than 1 mm.\nWash the tissue blocks with fresh PBS three times.\nKeep them in pre-cooled serum-free culture medium at 4°C.\nTransplant the tissue blocks to mice within 4 h.\nIn vivo selection of HM OC cells\nTiming: 3 months",
    "Timing: 10–15 min for each mouse (for steps 23–40)\nTiming: 20 min for each mouse (for steps 41–48)\nTiming: 3–4 weeks for each cycle (for steps 58–60)\nThis section aims to enrich the OC cells with highly metastatic ability through the in vivo selection, which involves establishing the orthotopic model, in vivo bioluminescent imaging, and dissociating the omental metastases.\nEstablishing the orthotopic transplantation model\nPlace the surgical instruments and objects (the stereomicroscope, sterilized surgical kit, mouse mask, and operating platform) on a clean bench.\nDisinfect the surfaces of all objects with 75% ethanol spray followed by 30 min UV irradiation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3097-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Note: For most human OC cell lines, BALB/c nude mice are used for transplantation. For ID8 cells, C57BL/6 mice are used for transplantation. For PDXs and cells with poor tumorigenicity, mice with higher levels of immuno-deficiency should be used, such as NOD-SCIDs, NSG etc. The mice aged 5–6 weeks are used for orthotopic transplantation. The body weight should be more than 16 g in order to guarantee that they can tolerate the surgery.\nCritical: We recommend utilizing three mice for this step, considering the possibility of unexpected unsuccessful modelling. If all succeeded, in addition to the orthotopic xenograft for the next passage mice, the extra omental tumor lesions obtained are recommended for primary cell isolation, paraffin embedding and cryopreservation.\nPlaced the mouse on the right side after it is fully anesthetized.\nModify the gas flow of mask at 0.75 L/min and keep the mouse anesthetized by isoflurane through the respiratory mask.\nNote: In the step 28, all three mice are anesthetized in the induction cage simultaneously. While in the step 29, the mice receive surgery one by one. The mice waiting for transplantation are left in the induction cage to keep anesthetized.\nOpen the abdominal cavity.\nDisinfect the skin of its left abdomen with 75% ethanol.\nUse curved ophthalmic forceps to lift the skin at the lowest point and make a 0.4–0.8 cm incision with ophthalmic scissors.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3097-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The position of the incision\nLeft: the lowest point in the side view (the yellow arrow). Right: the incision should be made at the lowest point in the depression area between the rib bow and the thigh near the spine on a left lateral position. Circle: the spleen (white); the kidney (blue); the suitable area for incision (red). Figures originally published in Ying F. et al., iScience.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]",
    "Critical: In this position, a depression can be observed on the left lateral abdomen, between the rib bow and the thigh, near the spine (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nSearch a fat pad sized approximately 0.3 cm × 0.4 cm under the abdominal incision near the spine side.\nGently grip the edge of the fat pad with micro forceps and slowly pull it outside.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3097-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. The process of implanting the tissue blocks\n(A) The ovary of the mouse, circle: the fat pad (yellow), the ovary (red).\n(B) The incision of the bursa of ovary, green arrow.\n(C) Insert the tissue block into the bursa of ovary, circle: the tissue block (blue).\n(D) Stitch the incision of bursa with a 7-0 suture.\nNote: A red spherical organization wrapped in the center can be observed, which is the ovary of the mouse (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nKeep the fat pad moist with normal saline throughout the surgery. Place the mouse under the stereomicroscope.\nOpen the ovarian bursa.\nGently grab the capsular membrane surrounding the ovary along the borderline of the ovarian bursa and the adipose tissue with micro forceps.\nMake an incision with a micro scissor whose size can just match or is slightly smaller than the transplanting tissue-block with a micro scissor (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C).\nInsert a tissue-block into the ovarian bursa with micro forceps, and push it deeply into the bursa as much as possible. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nClose the incision with a 7-0 suture (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nGently place the fat pad back to the abdominal cavity.\nClose the abdominal cavity with a 5-0 suture. Clean and disinfect the wound with 75% ethanol.\nTurn off the gas flow of mask and wait for the mouse to awaken from the anesthesia, and then return it back to the cages.",
    "Note: It usually takes the mouse around 3 min to awaken. And consider the small incision and their quick recovery, the pain relief isn’t required after surgery. No significant discomfort is observed after the surgery. No infection is observed in our experiments due to the SPF circumstance and aseptic technique.\nIn vivo bioluminescent imaging\nNote: The first imaging should be performed 7 days after the implantation.\nOptional: For tumors that cannot be labeled, such as PDX, disease progression can be detected by other equipment, such as X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and ultrasound. Ovarian tumor size can be estimated by abdominal palpation. In advanced diseases, ascites may also be observed.\nPrepare the IVIS and the luciferase substrate working solution.\nInitiate the IVIS and set the imaging mode to bioluminescence.\nDisinfect the imaging room with 75% ethanol and UV irradiation.\nThaw the luciferase substrate working solution at room temperature or in a 37°C incubator while protecting it from light.\nNote: The solution should be mixed up before injection.\nTransport the mice to the imaging room in sterile cages.\nInitiate the gas anesthesia system. Set the gas flow of induction cage at 1.5 L/min, concentration of isoflurane at 2.5% and oxygen pressure at 0.1 MPa.\nPut the mice into the anesthesia induction cage 4 min prior to the injection time. Then wait for the mice to be fully anesthetized.\nWeigh the mice and calculate the substrate dosage for each mouse.\nIntraperitoneally inject the 15 mg/mL D-luciferin solution into the mice at a dose of 150 mg/kg (10 μL/g) and allow the mice to metabolize for 15 min before imaging.",
    "Note: The peak imaging time is 10–20 min after injection. The bioluminescence signals will reach a plateau during this period. Usually there are several mice waiting for imaging. We recommend to intraperitoneally administer the substrate to different mice at 3-min intervals, and record the time point for each individual, so as to have enough time to complete imaging for each mouse.\nWhen the imaging time is reached, set the gas flow of the imaging chamber to 0.5 L/min, place the mouse in the chamber, and acquire the image.\nAfter successfully imaging, close the isoflurane flow and allow the mouse to wake up on the heat pad and then back to the cages. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nNote: The imaging interval is inversely related to the malignancy of the grafts. The more rapidly the tumors progress, the more frequently the imaging should be done. In our experiments, the imaging is performed every 7 days for ID8, while every 3 days on the mice bearing ES2 due to their rapid growth.\nDissociating the omental metastases\nEuthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia when peritoneal metastasis is observed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3097-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. The progress of the orthotopic mouse model\n(A) The representative bioluminescent images of the tumor progress of the orthotopic model. Figures originally published in Ying F. et al., iScience.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n(B) The representative photograph of metastatic omentum and other abdominal organs. Arrows: red (omentum), orange (stomach), yellow (spleen), blue (pancreas).\nNote: The typical bioluminescent image of metastasis can refer to Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A. Due to the difference between OC cells, it is difficult to assign an exact imaging signal count.\nLay the mouse on a piece of sterile gauze, and use 75% ethanol to disinfect the whole abdominal skin of the mouse.\nMake a horizontal “H” shaped incision to expose the abdominal organs.",
    "Note: The ophthalmic forceps and scissors should be sterilized in advance.\nCheck the left ovary to confirm tumor formation.\nSearch the omentum between the stomach and the spleen. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nDissociate the omentum and wash with PBS three times.\nSoak the omentum in 150 μg/mL D-luciferin solution in a 60 mm dish and incubate at 37°C for 2–3 min.\nPut the dish into the imaging chamber to conduct ex vivo imaging. Based on the image result, determine the tissue areas with strong bioluminescent signals.\nNote: The strong signals indicated that these parts of omental tissue contain many metastatic tumor cells.\nHarvest these parts of tissue and remove the bleeding or necrosis sections to obtain tumor tissue blocks for orthotopic transplantation to the mice of next passage.\nIn vivo selection cycle\nTransplant the tissue-blocks obtained from step 57 into the ovary bursas of passage 2 mice.\nThe subsequent processing and maintenance of the omentum tissues are the same as in steps 23 to 58.\nWait for the formation of peritoneal metastasis. Two more cycles of in vivo selection are conducted until passage 3 mice. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nNote: It usually takes 3–4 weeks for each cycle. The tumors in passage 2 and 3 mice will progress more rapidly than those in passage 1 mice.\nCritical: The in vivo selection should be conducted until at least passage 3 at least. More passages can be accepted to enrich HM cells with enhanced metastatic ability.\nIsolation and primary culture of HM cells from omental metastasis\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nThis section describes the procedure of isolating the HM cells from the omental metastasis and cultivating the cells ex vivo, all of which must be done in a sterile setting.\nIsolating the HM cells from omental metastasis from passage 3 mouse",
    "Obtain the omentum from the passage 3 mouse as previously described (dissociating the omental metastases[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2.3]). Wash it with PBS three times.\nPut the tissue in a new 5 mL Eppendorf tube, and cut the tissue into pieces of 0.1 mm3 in size.\nPrepare collagenase type 1 working solution by adding 200 μL of 1% collagenase type 1 solution in 1800 μL of serum-free medium at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.\nAdd 2 mL collagenase type 1 working solution and incubate the tube on a thermostat shaker at 37°C for 1 h.\nAdd 2 mL fresh medium to dilute the enzyme.\nMix the suspension and infiltrate with a 40 μm cell filter.\nObtain the precipitation through a 200 × g centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min.\nResuspend the precipitation in 5 mL complete DMEM/F12 medium and seed into a 25 cm2 culture flask.\nNote: No antibiotics are used in the culture media.\nPrimary culture of HM cells\nWash the cells with PBS and add fresh culture medium after 24 h of incubation at 37°C.\nObserve the adherent cells under an inverted microscope.\nChange the culture medium every three days.\nPassage cells at 85%–90% confluence."
