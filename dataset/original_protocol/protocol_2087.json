    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSetting up the plasmid library\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes determination of the titer and amplification of the plasmid library.\nDetermining plasmid library titer.\nPrepare LB/Amp agar plates. Measure 25 g broth powder and 15 g bacteriological agar and swirl to mix in 1 L ultrapure water. Autoclave on liquid cycle (121 degree, 30 min) then cool to around 50°C in a temperature-controlled water bath. Add Ampicillin (final concentration 100 μg/mL) then pour the mixture into 18–20 15 cm plates (15–20 mL per plate) and allow so solidify at room temperature (25°C).\nDilute 1 μL of the bacterial plasmid library into 1 mL of LB broth and mix by gentle vortexing as Dilution A.\nDilute 1 μL of Dilution A into 1 mL of LB broth and mix by gentle vortexing as Dilution B.\nRemove 50 μL aliquots from Dilution B and spread onto each prewarmed LB/Amp agar plate.\nLeave the plate at room temperature (25°C) for 20 min and then incubate it inverted at 37°C overnight.\nCount the total number of colonies and calculate the titer by following this formula: (colony# from Dilution B/Plating volume) × 103 × 103 × 103 = colony-forming unit (cfu) per mL.\nNote: The titer should be at least 10-times higher than the number of independent clones present in the library. In this case, since our library size was ∼8.0 × 106, our cfu was >108.\nAmplification of plasmid library.\nPrepare enough of the cDNA library for transfection. Typically, this represents about 1 μL of 1,000-fold-diluted cDNA library culture (in E.coli DH10B) diluted in 150 μL of LB broth before spreading. It takes about 20 plates (150-mm) to amplify the whole cDNA library.\nIncubate plates at 37°C overnight.",
    "Add 5 mL of LB medium to each plate and scrape off colonies into 2 liters of LB/Amp broth. Repeat to ensure as much as possible was recovered from plates.\nIncubate cultures in a shaking incubator at 37°C to obtain a saturated culture (OD600 > 2.0).\nProceed with plasmid isolation using QIAGEN Maxi Prep (Catalog number 12162) (https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=0bd0c5fb-c271-43e7-af43-32d539374fa9&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=0bd0c5fb-c271-43e7-af43-32d539374fa9&lang=en]) to obtain highly purified plasmid library.\nVerification of cDNA representation.\nUse the 5′ and 3′ LIB primers (sequences in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) to amplify cDNA inserts by Advantage™-GC 2 PCR Kit (https://www.takarabio.com/resourcedocument/x32404[href=https://www.takarabio.com/resourcedocument/x32404]) in C1000 Thermal Cycler.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1677_4.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1677_5.csv\nConduct gel electrophoresis on the reactions to see a smear pattern consistent with the library size intervals. For the pLIB library we used here, that pattern should be between 0.5 kb to 5 kb size (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: The library used here was commercially procured, but cDNA libraries can be prepared in-house from any RNA pool. Flanking linkers can be added to the 5′ and 3′ insert ends using sequences compatible with 5′ and 3′ LIB primers or any other linker sequences determined fitting by the investigator.\nCritical: If the need arises, the amplified bacterial library can be stored frozen in 33% glycerol at −80°C for later use.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1677-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Lane 2, negative control without primers.\nPreparation of viral library\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes packaging plasmid library into viral particles.\nCulture of packaging cells.\nPlate HEK293T cells at a density of 6.0 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate 12 h before transfection.\nCritical: Replace old medium with fresh medium before transfection (1–2 h).",
    "Note: The number of packaging cell plates should be calculated and scaled based on library size. For example, the pLIB-human prostate retroviral library clone size we used here was ∼10 × 106, so 10-times more packaging cells were needed, i.e., 100 × 106 cells.\nTransfection of packaging cells.\nTransfect 10 μg of plasmid DNA along with 1 μg pCMV-VSV and 10 μg pUMVC using 63 μL Lipofectamine 2000 per 100-mm plate. Adapt viral envelope and packaging plasmid based on the nature of the plasmid (e.g., retroviral or lentiviral plasmid) carrying library inserts.\nNote: Gently swirl plates to make sure the transfection solution is distributed uniformly throughout the culture surface.\nVirus recovery.\nAspirate old medium at 10–12 h post-transfection, then wash the cells twice with 1× PBS and add 5–6 mL of fresh medium.\nAspirate medium 32–38 h after transfection and pass through 0.45 μm filters.\nMedia containing undiluted viral particles can be immediately used, stored at 4°C for use within 24 h, or frozen at −80°C for later use.\nCancer cell infection\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes viral library transduction of cancer cells.\nPreparation of GFP-DU145 cells.\nInfect DU145 cells with pRRL3 lentivirus to generate GFP-DU145 cells.\nPlate GFP-DU145 cells at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate 12 h before infection.\nGenerate 1:10 dilution of filtered library virus (preferably fresh) and administer to the GFP-DU145 cells in the presence of 5 μg/mL polybrene for 18 h.\nTo ensure the library is well represented, conduct genomic PCR of infected cells after 48–72 h using 5′ and 3′ LIB primers. A smear between 0.5-5 kb should be obtained, indicating adequate transcript representation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Of note, comparative library sequencing could also be conducted to ensure maintenance of library complexity.",
    "Critical: First, dilute the virus-containing media at least two-fold with fresh media. Second, it is very important to maintain a virion number that is substantially lower than the number of cells to be infected in order to reduce the risk of more than one cDNA insertion per cell. In our case here, and as an example, we used a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2, which we determined using pLAPSN, an expression plasmid containing the sequence of bacterial alkaline phosphatase. Assessment of alkaline phosphatase activity in the infected population allowed for a calculation of percentage of cells transduced, which, when combined with the dilution factor used and the number of cells plated provided us with a surrogate measure of viral titer and virion numbers to utilize.\nCellular library delivery in vivo and recovery of candidate colonization genes\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nThis section describes generation of metastases and verification of candidate colonization genes.\nGeneration of lung metastases.\nMix 1.5 × 105 of the infected GFP-DU145 cells in 100 μL PBS supplemented with 1% FBS and intravenously inject via tail vein into recipient NOD/SCID mice (8–10 weeks old).\nAfter 18 days, sacrifice these mice and excise and wash lungs in ice cold PBS. Lay down extracted lungs flat on a clean TC plate and examine the metastatic colonies using fluorescence-equipped dissecting SteREO stereomicroscope (Zeiss, Axio). Surgically cut pieces of lungs harboring distinct visible (∼1 mm in diameter) GFP-positive colonies, minimizing the carryover of peripheral lung tissues (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).
