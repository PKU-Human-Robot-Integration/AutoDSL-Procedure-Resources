    "The present protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. A healthy subject with a brain MRI scan that was free of artifacts or movement was used for this protocol demonstration, and written informed consent was obtained. A 3.0 T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil (see Table of Materials) was used to acquire 3D-T1 images with a 1 mm x 1 mm x 1.2 mm resolution. The MP-RAGE ASSET sequence with a 256 x 256 field of view, TR/TE/TI=7.38/3.06/400 ms, and an 11-degree flip angle was used.\n1. Importing brain MRI to 3D Slicer\nNOTE: 3D Slicer provides documentation related to its user interface.\nPrepare the brain MRI DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) or NIFTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) files for importing into 3D Slicer.\nImport DICOM data by clicking the DCM button in the upper left corner of the toolbar. Then click the Import DICOM files button to import DICOM format data.\nIf the MRI data is in the NIFTI format, import it by clicking the DATA button in the upper left corner of the toolbar. In the pop-up dialog, select Choose directory to Add to batch import NIFTI data in a folder or select Choose File(s) to Add to import specific NIFTI files. Then, click the OK button to proceed with data upload to 3D Slicer.\nAfter importation, MRI data will appear in the window on the right displaying axial, sagittal, and coronal planes.\nChange the layout of the windows by navigating to Layouts and selecting a specific layout. This can be found by either clicking on the Layouts module image in 3D Slicer's toolbar itself or via View > Layouts from the application menu.\n2. Downloading DICOM from sample data in 3D Slicer",
    "Click the Download sample data button in the opening screen of Welcome to Slicer section. Then select the MRHead button, and it will start the download process, which may take a few minutes.\nEnsure that the brain MRI data with axial, sagittal, and coronal planes are shown on the right window.\n3. Quality control and adjusting the MRI image\nDetermine qualitatively the image quality and the presence of artifacts due to head motion or scanning issues by critically reviewing each MRI slice.\nZoom the image slice by right-clicking and moving the mouse up or down to zoom out or in, respectively.\nTo move the image slice around, left-click the image, press and hold the Shift key, and drag the mouse around.\nAdjusting the image brightness can help with viewing the choroid plexus. To do this, either click on Adjust window/level of volume in the toolbar or left-click the image and move the mouse up or down to raise or lower the brightness, respectively.\nAdjusting contrast can additionally help with finding the choroid plexus. Left-click on the image slice and move the mouse to the left or right to increase or decrease the contrast, respectively. To determine the appropriate contrast for the choroid plexus, use the deep gray matter nuclei (central masses of gray matter arrayed around the lateral and third ventricles) or the signal intensity shown in the contrast scale bar.\nOnce the preferred contrast is selected, maintain the same contrast throughout segmentation and do not adjust for potential variations in supra- and infra-tentorial regions.\n4. Creating the manual segments of the choroid plexus",
    "To begin segmentation of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricle choroid plexus, create the segmentation files in the Segment Editor module. To navigate there, click either on the Segment Editor in the toolbar or go to the Modules: drop-down menu and select Segment Editor.\nClick on the drop-down menu for segmentation to select different segmentations (if multiple segmentations were created) and rename the currently selected segmentation.\nUse the Master Volume drop-down to choose which NIFTI or DICOM sets need editing. Only when the volume file is selected, the user can start segmenting/editing.\nClick the Add button twice to add two segments for the lateral ventricle choroid plexus. To rename these, double-click on the name and change them to Right lateral ventricle choroid plexus and Left lateral ventricle choroid plexus.\nClick the Add button again to add segments for the third and fourth ventricle choroid plexus, and rename them to \"3rd ventricle choroid plexus\" and \"4th ventricle choroid plexus\".\n5. Viewing different slices and segmentations\nBefore editing, perform a background study to know how to move between layouts in the viewing window and how to change the view or opacity of the segmentations.\nAt the top of the viewing window and to the left of the slice slider, click on the pin icon. This will open a drop-down menu, which may vary depending on the specific layout the window is in.\n\t​NOTE: Utilizing different layouts can be helpful when segmenting the choroid plexus since its structure can vary between individuals. For example, the 'Conventional' layout allows the user to simultaneously view all three slices and a 3D view of the scene. Choosing 'Red/Yellow/Green slice only' gives the user a close-up view of the 2D slice to allow for a more precise segmentation of the choroid plexus.",
    "6. Delineating lateral ventricle choroid plexus ROIs\nNOTE: Image registration to a template is not necessary for manual segmentation.\nFor the lateral ventricle choroid plexus, begin in the axial plane ensuring that the images are positioned based on the bicommissural line. Then use the trigonum collaterale as a reference point for locating the lateral ventricle choroid plexus.\n\t\nOnce edits have been made in the axial plane, move to the remaining views (sagittal and coronal) to ensure that the manual segmentation of the lateral ventricle choroid plexus is not capturing the surrounding brain parenchyma or CSF.\nTo begin editing, click on the segment to work on, and the segment name will become highlighted.\nClick on the Paint or Draw tool in the Effects section of Segment Editor to begin manual segmentation.\n\tNOTE: It is best to start segmenting in one plane (coronal, axial, or sagittal), and after segmentation has been completed in all of the slices, move to other planes to check and refine the manual segmentation. It is suggested that the user starts with the axial or coronal planes as the lateral ventricle choroid plexus is more easily seen in these views.\nWhen using the Draw tool, left-click and hold down to draw a contour at the boundary of the lateral ventricle choroid plexus. Once traced, right-click to fill in the drawn-in area.\nWhen using the Paint tool, first select the diameter of the brush to be used for painting. A 3% or 5% brush is suggested for a more precise delineation of the choroid plexus, while 10% can be useful for larger selections.\nFor either tool, utilize Paint or Erase to rectify any erroneous delineations by adding or removing selections.",
    "​NOTE: Referencing other planes of view can aid in identifying the lateral ventricle choroid plexus structure versus other brain structures, such as surrounding gray matter, the fornix, corpus callosum, or hippocampus. The user is encouraged to exclude brain scans that have choroid plexus cysts identified.\nUse the level of the red nucleus as a landmark for stopping the segmentation of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles.\n7. Delineating third and fourth ventricle choroid plexus ROIs\nNOTE: Higher resolution T1w images (such as 0.7 or 0.8 mm) and those obtained on a 7T MRI would provide a more accurate and reliable manual segmentation of the third and fourth ventricle choroid plexus. Segmenting the third and fourth ventricle choroid plexus is more difficult than the lateral ventricle choroid plexus as these regions can be much smaller and with fewer voxels to delineate.\nFor the third ventricle choroid plexus, begin in the sagittal plane and use the foramen of Monro, fornix, corpus callosum, thalamus, and internal cerebral vein as reference points to pinpoint the choroid plexus in the 3rd ventricle. Moving between slices within the same plane can aid in determining whether a region is the fornix, thalamus, vein, or third ventricle choroid plexus.\n\t\nOnce edits have been made in the sagittal plane, navigate to the remaining views (axial and coronal) to ensure that the manual segmentation of the third ventricle choroid plexus is not selecting the surrounding brain parenchyma or CSF.\nSimilarly, for the fourth ventricle choroid plexus, begin in the sagittal plane and use the superior cerebellar peduncle, pons, and medulla as reference points to pinpoint the choroid plexus in the fourth ventricle. Moving between slices within the same plane can aid in determining whether a region is the cerebellum, cerebellar tonsil, inferior medullary velum or 4th ventricle choroid plexus.",
    "Once edits have been completed in the sagittal plane, move to the remaining views (axial and coronal) to ensure that the manual segmentation of the fourth ventricle choroid plexus is not selecting surrounding brain parenchyma or CSF.\n8. Calculating the volumes of the choroid plexus\nFrom the Modules drop-down menu, navigate to Quantification and select Segment Statistics.\nUnder Inputs, select the new segmentation map for quantifying under the Segmentation tool and choose the MRI volume from the Scalar volume. For Output table (under Output), choose the Table option. Once complete, press Apply, and a table containing the volume of the choroid plexus will appear in various units.\n9. Saving the segments and volume results\nClick the Save button in the upper left corner of the toolbar to save generated files.\nSave the segmentation files as .nrrd (3D slicer file), .nii.gz (NIFTI file) or .tsv (table file).\n10. Determining accuracy, performance, and agreement of the segmentation\nNOTE: It is recommended to use the MONAI package (see Table of Materials), which describes the Dice Coefficient (DC) and the DeepMind average Surface Distance (avgSD). Details on DC and avgSD are described below. In order to compute these metrics, readers will need to know how to program (e.g., python, read images from disk, re-format the data to the appropriate input arrays for these functions). There is no user-friendly package that includes all these metrics.\nThe DC score is a standard approach to quantify the overlap of two geometric domains. To compute the average DC score between two segmentations, provide two tensors y_pred and y, i.e., multi-frame images with one frame for each binarized label image. Tensors y_pred and y may contain segmentations of two different manual raters, repeated segmentations of the same rater, or automated prediction and manual ground truth.",
    "Use the function monai.metrics.compute_meandice to calculate the mean DC score.\nGenerate suitable binary label tensors with monai.transforms.post.\n\t\tNOTE: The include_background parameter can be set to False to exclude the first category (channel index 0) from the DC computation, which is, by convention, assumed to be a background.\nConsider the avgSD score less common, and note that the approach can differ as multiple definitions exist for surface distance. For example, use the max distance (also known as Hausdorff distance, highly sensitive to outliers), the mean distance (as described here), and the 95th percentile (highly robust) as frequently used measures.\n\t\nUse the function compute_average_surface_distance to calculate the avgSD score.\nEnsure that this function computes the Average Surface Distance from y_pred to y under the default setting.\nIn addition, if symmetric = True, ensure that the average symmetric surface distance between these two inputs is returned.\nPerform the statistical analysis of the DC and avgSD score across multiple cases can be performed by using the robust Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired analysis.\nConsider using the Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as another commonly used method to determine whether multiple participants can be rated reliably by different raters. Remember that ICC operates on a set of paired measurements (e.g., the volume) of segmentations and not on the segmentation images directly. To compute ICC, use R software and R Studio (see Table of Materials), which makes the process straightforward.\n\t\nDownload the package using install.packages(\"psych\") and load the library(psych).\nEnter the data frame, which includes the participants (rows) and a rater in each column, by using Data <- data.frame(df). Then visualize the measurements using plot (Data).\nTo run ICC, use ICC(Data), which generates a table of the different types of ICC, e.g., to obtain the inter- or intra-rater scores.\nSubscription Required.
