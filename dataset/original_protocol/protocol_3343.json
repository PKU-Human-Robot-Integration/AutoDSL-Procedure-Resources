    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nWe divided these methods into four steps: (1) preparing the sample, (2) performing the cryo-ultramicrotomy, (3) TEM imaging, and (4) lipid extraction. Following this protocol involves TEM imaging both before and after lipid extraction, but the procedure for imaging post-extraction is identical to the procedure pre-extraction.\nSample Preparation\nTiming: 30 min\nEpicarp of V. tinus fruit is cryo-fixed for cryo-ultramicrotomy.\nPour liquid nitrogen in a stainless steel Dewar.\nPut the lower half of a small container in liquid nitrogen and let it cool down to the liquid nitrogen temperature.\nNote: The container may be made of plastic or metal with a volume of about 5 mL. We utilized the lower part of a 15-mL centrifuge tube with a brass wire attached to the edge of the tube as a handle (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/311-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic Illustrations of Sample Preparation\n(A) Specimen shapes between step 4 and step 7.\n(B) Side (left) and block face views (right) of the frozen specimen before (step 13) and after (step 15) trimming.\n(C and D) Freezing apparatus consisting of a centrifuge tube, brass wire, and a Dewar.\n(E) Specimen placed in a specimen holder. The photo was taken after recovering the specimen to room temperature (ca. 20°C–25°C).\nFill the container with ethane gas and let it liquidize.\nPeel pericarp of fresh V. tinus fruit with a razor blade and blot excess juice with a piece of filter paper.\nNote: The blotting time should be minimized, as otherwise it will cause dehydration of the epicarp and alter the ultrastructure.\nNote: Thickness of the peeled epicarp is typically 100–200 μm.\nNote: While there is little flesh/pulp in V. tinus, it is important to remove as much flesh as possible to facilitate the cryo-ultramicrotomy.",
    "Cut the peeled epicarp into a strip with dimensions of ca. 3 mm (L) × 1 mm (W), and cut a strip of filter paper with dimensions of ca. 5 mm (L) × 3 mm (W).\nSpread carbon adhesive paste (graphite adhesive) on half of the filter paper strip.\nPlace the epicarp on the edge of the filter paper strip in such a way that only its lower half is in contact with the half-dried carbon paste on the filter paper as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.\nLet the carbon paste dry and make sure that the pericarp is well adhered to the filter paper strip.\nHold the filter paper part of the specimen with tweezers.\nNote: Use cross locked tweezers for better handling.\nNote: Liquid ethane can solidify in the liquid nitrogen bath. If so, before step 9 melt the solid ethane by touching it with clean room-temperature objects such as tweezers.\nQuench the specimen in liquid ethane and let it freeze for about 10 s.\nNote: This freezing procedure can be performed using an (semi-)automated vitrification machine, such as Leica EMGP or Leica CPC when the specimen size is comparable to the size of an EM grid.\nTransfer the frozen specimen to liquid nitrogen in a polystyrene container in order to keep it frozen until ultramicrotomy.\nCryo-Ultramicrotomy\nTiming: 1 h\nCryo-ultrathin sections of the epicarp are cut and collected on a carbon-coated grid for TEM imaging.\nTransfer the frozen specimen from the polystyrene container to the cryochamber using tweezers precooled in liquid nitrogen.\nFix the filter paper part of the specimen in the flat clamp of the specimen holder (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3F) and let the specimen temperature equilibrate to the set specimen temperature (−110°C).",
    "Rotate the knife holder to put the trimming tool in the cutting position and approach the trimming tool to the tip of the specimen.\nTrim the specimen using the trimming tool to make a specimen surface with dimensions of ca. 0.1 mm (L) × 0.05 mm (W) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nRotate the knife holder to set the diamond knife in the cutting position and approach the knife to the specimen surface.\nHold the glow-discharged grid with tweezers and insert the tweezers in a micromanipulator of the cryochamber.\nUsing the micrometer gauges of the micromanipulator, place the grid slightly below the diamond knife.\nActivate the discharge function of the antistatic device.\nCut ultrathin sections of thickness of about 90 nm and transfer them to the grid surface using an eyelash. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nNote: We used a cutting speed of 0.1 mm/s for ultrathin sectioning.\nNote: The ultrathin sections do not form a ribbon in most cases since the shape of the cutting surface is often not ideal due to the tissue shape (as sections are not embedded and thus cannot be shaped into a typical trapezoid), so sections must be individually transferred from the knife edge to the grid surface.\nDisactivate the discharge function of the antistatic device to ensure adhesion of the sections on the grid surface.\nRetract the grid from the knife using the micrometer gauges.\nRemove the grid from the cryochamber and let it warm up to room temperature (ca. 20°C–25°C) under nitrogen gas or dry air flow.",
    "Note: Simple melt-drying is used for the V. tinus epicarp since the cell wall ultrastructure is not significantly altered by ice recrystallization due to its robustness and relatively low hydration level. For more hydrated soft tissues, one would need to use gentler recovery methods such as freeze drying to prevent ice artifacts (Geymayer et al., 1978[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nTEM Imaging\nTiming: 1 h\nTEM observation is performed on the cryo-ultrathin sections of the epicarp under low-dose condition.\nMount the grid in a standard TEM holder and then insert the holder into the TEM.\nAdjust the sample position to the eucentric height and perform TEM alignment if necessary.\nSet up Low Dose mode in SerialEM at a blank (non-specimen) area. The overall radiation dose, a sum of those from Search and Acquisition, should not exceed 4 e-/Å−1.\nNote: The detailed procedure for setting up of Low Dose mode can be found in the online help of SerialEM (https://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/hlp/html/about_low_dose.htm[href=https://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/hlp/html/about_low_dose.htm]). Briefly, the Low Dose mode consists of three “areas”: Record, View, and Focus, as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. The Record area is the area where a micrograph is recorded. The View area is at lower magnification and shares the center of the Record area. The Focus area is used to check and modify the defocus value without exposing the Record area, so it is displaced from the Record area along the tilt axis. In this protocol, the magnification was set at ×6,000–10,000 for Record and Focus, and ×2,000–4,000 for View. The target defocus value was set at −5–10 μm.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/311-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Low-Dose Setting in SerialEM\nColored squares indicate three predefined areas in the low-dose mode.\nAcquire images of the sections using the Low Dose mode.",
    "Critical: The specimen is an unfixed and unstained biological tissue, so extensive electron radiation causes severe radiation damage which alters the chemical composition of the components, and hence their solubility to solvents. It is thus necessary to perform TEM imaging in the low dose condition to minimize the radiation damage.\nNote: In the case of V. tinus, the unstained lipid globules show dark image contrast due to their crystallinity and likely higher density compared to that of the surrounding cell wall matrix (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/311-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Image Contrast of Lipid Globules in the Epicarpal Cell Wall of V. tinus Before and After Chloroform Extraction\n(A) Untreated globules showing strong dark image contrast. Cm, cell wall matrix; Lg, lipid globules.\n(B) Globules after insufficient chloroform extraction with slightly reduced image contrast. The contrast is heterogeneous in a single globule due to partial dissolution of lipids.\n(C and D) Globules after sufficient chloroform extraction. The image contrast of the globules is homogeneously and significantly reduced (C) or almost absent (D). Scale bars, 500 nm.\nNote: For better tracking of the sections after the lipid extraction step it is recommended to take a low magnification image of the sections (×100–600). Because the same area of the sample should be re-imaged following lipid extraction with chloroform, the sample will likely be rotated in the grid holder. A low magnification image facilitates finding the same region of the sample for re-imaging.\nRemove the grid from the TEM.\nLipid Extraction and Re-imaging\nTiming: 1–2 h\nLipids in the epicarp are extracted using the reflux extractor and the treated section is observed to localize the lipids.\nPut the grid on a filter paper strip.\nPut the strip on the sample holder of the reflux extractor.",
    "Insert the holder in the extractor and tilt the holder by about 20°, so condensed chloroform will flow down from the holder surface.\nTreat the grid with refluxed chloroform for 10–20 min.\nCritical: Make sure that condensed chloroform flows down from the sample holder. The movement of liquid chloroform around the specimen is essential for effective extraction of lipids. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nRemove the grid from the extractor and let it dry in air.\nInsert the treated grid into the TEM.\nObserve the previously observed area of the specimen under the same low dose condition.\nCompare the image contrast of the same view field before and after the chloroform extraction.\nNote: After the chloroform extraction the loss of material of the lipid globules should be observed as their reduced image contrast as shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]."
