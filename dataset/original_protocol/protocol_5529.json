    "Preparation of a dissection dish (Figure 2)Mix two kinds of silicone solutions (3.6 ml KE-106 and 0.4 ml CAT-RG) in a 35-mm culture dish (or its lid) and incubate at 37 °C for 2 days to congeal silicone. This dissection dish may be used several times.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128220304_1335.jpgFigure 2. Dissection dishPreparation of an observation tank (Figure 3)Put 2 pieces of plastic tape (20 x 25 mm) on a cutting board and cut out a square (10 x 10 mm) in the center of these tapes.Place the newly cut piece of tape on a cover slip (24 x 40 mm).Turn over the remaining piece of tape from step 2a.Put the tips of two insect pins on the adhesive surface of the tape and align the two pins at so that they are 2 mm apart (Figure 3).Put the tape with insect pins from step 2d on the tape attached to the cover glass as shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128220414_5110.jpgFigure 3. Assembly of an observation tankDissection of a larva (Figure 4)Prepare a fillet of larva on the dissection dish according to the following steps (larval dissection protocol Brent et al., 2009) is slightly modified. We use HL-3 warmed to room temperature):Pick up a third-instar larva and wash the body surface in HL-3 solution (see Recipes). Third-instar larvae (three days after hatching at 25 °C) stop feeding behavior and climb on wall of a vial, which is referred to as wandering behavior. Transfer the larva into 1 ml of HL-3 solution on the dissection dish.Hold both the front and tail edges of the larva using short insect pins (red arrowheads in Figure 4A), keeping its dorsal side upward so that the tracheae (white arrows in Figure 4A) can be seen through the body wall.",
    "Cut the body wall along the dorsal midline from the tail side (yellow dashed line in Figure 4B) to construct a fillet, holding the four corners of the body wall with short pins (red arrowheads in Figures 4C and 4D). Carefully remove the gut, fat bodies and salivary glands without injuring the ventral ganglion (orange arrows in Figures 4E and 4F), axons or body muscles. Fluorescence will be observed within the ventral ganglion (yellow dashed circles in Figures 4G and 4H) and axons (white arrowheads in Figures 4G and 4H) when using flies that express fluorescence markers in motor neurons. The green fluorescence signals in Figures 4F and 4H are derived from preproANF-EMD.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128220522_5059.jpgFigure 4. Dissection procedure for a larval fillet on a dissection dish. Scale bars = 1 mm for (A-F) and 5 µm for (G, H).Placement of a larva in observation tank (Figure 5)Carefully remove the short pins from the larva and transfer the larva to the observation tank filled with HL-3. Extend the head and tail of the larva carefully and secure them with pins (epidermis side up, Figure 5). Rinse by changing the HL-3 solution twice and put a cover glass (18 x 18 mm) to protect the larva against desiccation. Note: There is no need to hold the cover glass with nail polish. An organic solvent in nail polish could affect the neuronal activity.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128220735_1237.jpgFigure 5.

Larval motor neuron axons are observed from below using a 40x objective.ImagingLocate a motor neuron axon (Figure 6A) under an inverted fluorescence microscope. A laser-scanning microscope equipped with a high sensitivity detector is preferable.",
    "Capture live images every 0.1 sec for 30 sec under a 40x objective lens (Videos 1 and 2). To ensure that healthy neurons are imaged, it is important to complete the dissection within 5 min and subsequent observation within 5 min. Note: We usually use motor neuron axons projecting to the A6 muscles (Figure 4I). See also Figure 1A in Matzat et al., 2015. Choosing specific axons and observation of the same axonal region may be important to evaluate transport property.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171128/20171128220854_8414.jpgFigure 6. Generation of a kymograph from stacked images. 1) Open stacked images. To crop images, see an explanation in the box. 2) Select ‘Image > Stacks > Reslice’ menu. 3) Input an appropriate value in ‘Output spacing’ and check ‘Avoid interpolation’. ‘Output spacing’ defines the size of Y-axis ROI and we used 0.152. 4) Resultant resliced images represent kymographs of non-interpolated X-axis ROI (each pixel-line from top to bottom). 5) ‘Image > Stacks > Z-Projection’ menu merges all of stacked kymographs. Select ‘Max Intensity’ tab in the Z-Projection window. 6) Then, a merged kymograph appears.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.
