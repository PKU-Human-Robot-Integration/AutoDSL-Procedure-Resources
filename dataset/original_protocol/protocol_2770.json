    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare bacterial stocks for mice infection\nTiming: ∼ 28 days\nIn this step we prepare, freeze and titer the bacterial stocks needed for mice infection.\nGrow an aliquot of each bacterial strain needed for the experiment in a 37°C incubator, using 10 mL of 7H9 media in a 25 cm2 polystyrene tissue culture flask with vented cap, up to log phase (OD600 = 0.6–0.8).\nCritical: make sure to add the appropriate antibiotic selection marker for your strain. For our experiment we grew the hspx’::GFP/smyc’::mCherry strain in 7H9 media + 50 mg/mL of Hygromycin B. Failure to add the selection marker will result in loss of plasmid and relative fluorescence during mouse infection, and consequently it won’t be possible to discriminate between infected vs bystander cells during cell sorting.\nAfter ∼ 7 days of growth (depending on the initial inoculum), check OD600 with a spectrophotometer. If bacteria have reached log phase go to step 3, otherwise keep growing them until they reach OD600 = 0.6–0.8.\nOnce bacteria have reached log phase, spin down the culture at 2,800 × g for 10′ at 20°C–25°C, using a 15 mL falcon tube.\nWhile the bacterial cultures are spinning down, prepare and mark the amount of freezing vials that are needed to stock and freeze the bacterial samples (20 vials for each 10 mL culture).\nResuspend the bacterial pellet in 1 mL of 7H9 media plus antibiotic (if appropriate).\nUsing a 1 mL tuberculin syringe with a 25 gauge needle insert the syringe into the falcon tube and pass the bacterial culture in and out of the syringe for 20 times.\nCritical: proceed to the next step immediately, so that bacteria won’t have time to clump.",
    "Add 9 mL of 7H9 media plus antibiotic (if appropriate) and slowly pipette the bacterial culture up and down 10 times.\nImmediately transfer 500 μL of culture to each freezing vial.\nAdd 500 μL of a 40% glycerol stock solution to each freezing vial containing the bacterial culture (final volume = 1 mL) and pipette up and down until the bacterial stock solution appears homogenous.\nStore the bacterial stock solutions at −80°C for 7 days.\nAfter 7 days, thaw 3 randomly selected frozen vials at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: we wait 7 days at −80°C because after freezing some bacteria will die and we want to precisely determine the titer of the bacterial stocks prior to mice infection.\nTransfer each bacterial stock to a 15 mL tube and passage it through a BD tuberculin syringe (25G needle) 15 times to breakup bacterial clumps.\nTransfer 200 μL of each bacterial stock to a 96-well plate to perform serial dilutions and then plate for colony forming units (CFU) on 7H10 agar plates.\nAfter 21 days, count the number of bacterial colonies to determine the titer of the frozen bacterial stocks.\nMouse infection\nTiming: ∼ 2 h\nIn this step of the protocol we are going to infect mice intranasally with 1.5 × 103 CFU of our bacterial stocks.\nThaw the bacterial aliquots that are needed for mice infection at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: for cell sorting of the infected and bystander populations we infect some extra mice to use as gating and compensation controls. In the case of,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] we used a mouse infected with hsp60’::GFP Erdman (bacteria that constitutively express GFP), a mouse infected with smyc’::mCherry Erdman (bacteria that constitutively express mCherry) and a mouse infected with WT Erdman Mtb to be used as a compensation control for CD45 staining (See Figures S1A–S1C of1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).",
    "Transfer the bacterial cultures into 15 mL falcon tubes and passage them through a 1 mL BD Tuberculin Syringe with a 25G needle 15 times to breakup bacterial clumps.\nDepending on the titer of the bacterial stocks calculated on step 14, calculate the number of dilutions to reach a final concentration of 5 × 104 bacteria/mL needed for mice infection. Perform the dilutions in infection buffer, using 2 mL Eppendorf screw cap tubes.\nCritical: slowly pipette up and down 5–6 times when you transfer Mtb in the subsequent dilution tube to allow homogenous resuspension of the bacteria in the tube and avoid carrying over potential clumps.\nAnesthetize the mice using an isoflurane and oxygen mixture (5% isoflurane in oxygen at 4.5 L/min; VIP 3000 isoflurane vaporizer) for ∼ 2 min, until the animals are sedated and the breath slows down.\n30 μL (1.5 × 103 bacteria) are then administered intranasally to each mouse.\nNote: mice infected with different strains are kept in different cages for the duration of the infection, to prevent strain cross-contamination. We suggest preparing and labeling the cages before performing infection to avoid any potential mix-up when working with high numbers of animals.\nGeneration of a single-cell suspension and antibody staining for flow sorting\nTiming: ∼ 1 h\nFollow steps 4–18 of the previously published protocol to obtain a lung single-cell suspension.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nSlowly remove the supernatant and resuspend in 2 mL of washing solution.\nTransfer the lung single-cell suspensions to 2 mL Eppendorf screw cap tubes.\nSpin down at 500 × g for 3′ at 20°C–25°C.\nOptional: resuspend in 1 mL of Fc blocking solution (Washing solution + Fc block (anti CD16/32 for mouse)) and incubate for 15′ at 4°C. Spin down at 500 × g for 3′ at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Note: this step is only necessary if sorting using surface markers staining to discriminate and gate on specific immune populations. For our single-cell RNA-seq paper, we sorted directly on bacterial fluorescence to discriminate infected cells and we only used CD45 to sort the Bystander population, therefore we didn’t perform blocking.\nRemove the supernatant. Resuspend the lung pellet with the antibody mix in washing solution at the appropriate concentration.\nIncubate for 30′ in the dark at 4°C.\nAdd 600 μL of washing solution and pipette mix 5–6 times.\nSpin down at 500 × g for 3′ at 20°C–25°C.\nWash with 1 mL of washing solution and spin down again at 500 × g for 3’.\nResuspend in sorting buffer at an appropriate concentration based on the characteristics of your cell sorter (we typically resuspend the lung pellet in sorting buffer such that the sorting efficiency > 80%).\nPass the lung suspension through a 30 μM cell strainer to avoid the formation of clumps that can clog the nozzle of the instrument.\nCritical: keep the samples at 4°C or in ice while you setup the cell sorter.\nFlow sorting, ADT-HTO staining, and methanol fixation\nTiming: variable, depending on the number of samples and speed of the instrument\nFill 1.5 mL Eppendorf low-bind tubes (one for each sorted sample) with 600 μL of Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend).\nNote: this amount depends on your machine. We typically sort ∼60,000 cells in 300 μL of sorting volume.\nPrepare the sorting gates, acquire and start sorting the samples according to the Figures S1A–S1C of the original manuscript.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCritical: Keep the sorted samples at 4°C during the sorting process if your sorter allows chilling of the output tubes.\nSort the cells directly into the 1.5 mL Eppendorf low-bind tubes containing 600 μL of Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend).",
    "Immediately at the end of the sorting, spin down the cells at 500 × g for 5′ at 20°C–25°C.\nWhile the cells are spinning down, prepare the blocking solution according to manufacturer instructions. For example, if working with mice and if you have 4 sorted samples, prepare a master mix blocking solution mixing 2 μL of TruStain FcX™ PLUS (anti-mouse CD16/32) in 198 μL of Cell staining Buffer (Biolegend).\nCarefully remove the supernatant using a wide-bore 1 mL pipette tip first, and then completely remove the remaining supernatant with a 200 μL pipette tip. Be careful to not touch the tiny pellet.\nResuspend the pellet from each sample in 50 μL of blocking solution.\nIncubate for 15′ at 4°C.\nIn the meantime, prepare the HTO-ADT antibody pool. Add 1 μL of each HTO Totalseq antibody to each sample (for cell hashing) and a titrated amount of each ADT antibody (for cell surface marker staining), according to manufacturer instructions.\nNote: we usually prepare a master mix solution for the ADT antibodies using saturating amounts of each antibody. For example, if you have 4 samples:\nPrepare 5 different 1.5 mL Eppendorf low bind tubes (4 tubes for each sample and 1 tube for the ADT antibody pool).\nAdd 1 μL of a different HTO antibody to each of the 4 tubes.\nIn the ADT antibody pool tube, add 2 μL of each ADT antibody and then add Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend) up to a final volume of 196 μL. If you have > 100 ADT antibodies, no volume adjustment is necessary.\nQuickly spin down the ADT antibody pool at 8,000 × g for 15 s, and slowly pipette mix 5–6 times using a 200 μL pipette tip.",
    "Transfer 49 μL of the ADT antibody pool to each of the 4 tubes containing HTO antibodies and pipette mix.\nQuickly spin down the HTO-ADT antibody mixes at 8,000 × g for 15 s.\nAfter 15′ of incubation in step 38, add 50 μL of each HTO-ADT antibody mix to each sample and slowly mix by pipetting up and down 5–6 times.\nIncubate for 30′ at 4°C.\nAdd 300 μL of chilled Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend) to each sample.\nSpin down at 500 × g for 5′ at 20°C–25°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant without touching the cell pellet.\nRepeat the washing step 42–44.\nResuspend each pellet in 150 μL of chilled DPBS.\nAdd 1,350 μL (final volume = 1.5 mL of 90% Methanol solution) of frozen Methanol to each sample drop-by-drop while rocking the tube in the meantime, to fix the cells.\nNote: we fix the cells at this stage, since the subsequent steps involving library generation and sequencing are performed outside the BSL3.\nStore at −20°C for up to a week or at −80°C for long term storage.\nRehydration of the fixed cells\nTiming: ∼40 min\nCritical: we usually perform the following steps under a Biosafety hood. Clean all surfaces and pipettes with a product such as RNAse zap, to prevent degradation of RNA. Wear gloves at all times during the process. Maintain a clean and sterile work environment.\nDecontaminate and pick up the methanol-frozen samples from the BSL-3 and equilibrate them on ice for 15’.\nPrepare 2 mL (for 4 samples) of Rehydration buffer and keep on ice.\nSpin down the methanol-frozen samples at 500 × g, 4°C for 10’.\nUnder the Biosafety hood, carefully remove and discard as much methanol as possible, without disturbing the cell pellet at the bottom of the tube.",
    "Note: carry over of even small traces of methanol into the 10× chip will lead to a failed run.\nQuickly resuspend the pellet in 300 μL of Rehydration Buffer, by slowly pipetting up and down 10 times using a 200 μL pipette-tip.\nSpin down at 500 × g, 10′ at 4°C.\nRepeat wash steps 52–55.\nDepending on the number of sorted cells, resuspend the pellet in 40 μL of Rehydration Buffer. We typically resuspend in 40 μL of Rehydration Buffer for every 60,000 sorted cells. Keep on ice.\nCount the cells for each sample with a hemocytometer, withdrawing 10 μL volume from each sample.\nAdjust the concentration of each sample to be between 700–1,200 cells/μL using Rehydration Buffer (this is the recommended input requirement for loading into the 10× chip).\nNote: at this point samples tagged with different HTOs can be combined in the desired proportions to multiplex into a single 10× run. If HTOs have not been used, then every sample needs to be run separately into a single 10× run.\nAlternative approach: HTO and ADT staining after methanol-fixation.\nEquilibrate methanol-fixed samples on ice for 15’.\nIn the meantime, prepare HTO and ADT antibody pools as described above, using Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend) containing 0.5 U/μL of RNase inhibitor.\nSpin down samples at 500 × g, 4°C for 10’.\nRemove as much methanol as possible without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend in 300 μL of Rehydration Buffer.\nRepeat wash step c-f.\nSpin down at 500 × g, 4°C for 10’.\nRemove as much rehydration buffer as possible.\nResuspend the pellet from each sample in 50 μL of blocking solution (Cell staining Buffer containing 0.5 U/μL of RNase inhibitor + TruStain FCx plus).\nIncubate 15′ at 4°C.",
    "Add 50 μL of the HTO-ADT antibody mix to each sample and slowly pipette up and down for 5–6 times.\nIncubate for 30′ at 4°C.\nAdd 300 μL of Cell Staining Buffer (Biolegend) containing 0.5 U/μL of RNase inhibitor.\nSpin down at 500 × g for 10′ at 4°C.\nWash twice in 200 μL of Cell Staining Buffer containing 0.5 U/μL of RNase inhibitor, to remove all traces of non-bound antibodies.\nResuspend in Cell Staining Buffer containing 0.5 U/μL of RNase inhibitor to a final concentration of 700–1,200 cells/μL, counting the cells for each sample on a hemocytometer.\nAt this stage, samples tagged with different HTOs can be multiplexed in a single 10× run.\nGeneration of CITE-seq libraries and sequencing\nTo generate CITE-seq libraries we follow the commercially available protocols from 10× (CG000206 Rev D) with the following modifications.\nIn step 1.1: we use the single-cell suspension generated in step 58 of the “rehydration of the fixed cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]” section as the input for step 1.2b of the 10× protocol.\nCritical: first add the appropriate amount of Nuclease Free Water to the master mix and pipette mix 15 times, until the solution is homogeneous. Do not add nuclease free water to the single cell suspension.\nCritical: Pipette mix the single cell suspension 20 times before adding to the master mix, to breakup any potential clumps that could clog the chip and lead to a failed run.\nIn step 2.2a: we add 1 μL of ADT additive primer and 1 μL of HTO additive primer (if using both HTO and ADT) to the cDNA amplification mix. We also use the cDNA primers (included with the 10× kit) instead of the Feature cDNA Primers as highlighted in the 10× protocol, according to Biolegend recommendations[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/protocols/totalseq-a-antibodies-and-cell-hashing-with-10x-single-cell-3-reagent-kit-v3-3-1-protocol].",
    "For the library preparation for HTO and ADT antibodies we follow the Biolegend protocol[href=https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/protocols/totalseq-a-antibodies-and-cell-hashing-with-10x-single-cell-3-reagent-kit-v3-3-1-protocol] without modifications.\nFor sequencing, we usually combine libraries (mRNA, HTO and ADT) from 2 samples on a single sequencing run on a NextSeq 2k. We typically allocate 80% of the total output reads to the mRNA libraries (split accordingly to the number of cells loaded in the 10× chip for each sample), 10% for the HTO libraries and 10% for the ADT libraries. We perform paired-end sequencing with the following parameters: 28 bp Read 1, 8 bp Index I7, 56 bp Read 2."
