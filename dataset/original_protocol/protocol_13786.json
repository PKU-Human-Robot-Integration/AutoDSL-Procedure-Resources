    "Our study was approved by the Academic Ethics Committee of the Biological Sciences Division of the Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China.\n1. General aspects of method development\nUse a USB digitizer (e.g., Wacom Cintiq Pro 16) and a handheld stylus pen for the handwriting movements. The detailed specifications of the digitizer are as follows: external dimensions (width x depth x height) 410 x 265 x 17.5 mm, spatial resolution 3840 x 2160 dots, pixel size 0.090 x 0.090 mm, temporal resolution 30 ms, and a pressure level of 8,192.\nConnect a laptop PC to the digitizer to collect and exhibit the handwriting traces.\nUse a software (e.g., Neuroscript MovAlyzeR) for data recording, processing, and analyzing.\nPatient inclusion/exclusion criteria\n\t\nRecruit MCI participants who present with a memory complaint, an objectively impaired memory function, intact activities of daily living, and the absence of dementia21. Besides, they should have the educational level of more than 2 years of preliminary school in mainland China, otherwise, they might have difficulty in writing Chinese characters.\nExclude participants who have obvious visual and upper limb disability.\n2. Handwriting task\nRun the software and a non-inking stylus pen.\nCreate an example of Chinese characters on the writing area of the digitizer (see Figure 1).\nAllow the subjects to position the writing area into a comfortable position.\nAllow the subjects to write on the writing area and accommodate the pen and the surface of the writing area.\nSet the sampling rate in the software at 200 Hz.\nInstruct the subjects to write his/her name in Chinese with the dominant hand.\n\tNOTE: A signature in either cursive or a printed version is acceptable, as the subject wished.\nInstruct the subjects to write the Chinese character “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg” (pronounced “Zheng”) with the dominant hand.",
    "NOTE: The Chinese character “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg” in a printed version is acceptable.\n\t\nRemind the subjects to write in a printed version prior to beginning handwriting.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the subject sits and writes in an upright position.\nKeep instructions visible during each trial.\n\t\nRepeat the handwriting trial three times.\nIf the character “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg” was in written in the wrong stroke order, stop the trial and trace and show the subject how to write the character in the correct stroke order.\nIf any hesitation was derived from a lack of knowledge, stop the trial and show the subject how to write the character correctly.\n3. Data analysis\nRun the software; right click on Experiment and select Properties.\nSelect Processing, and then select Segmentation.\nClick on Add first segmentation at any rate, Add last segmentation at any rate, and Move segmentation point to nearest pendown if on a penlift in Segmentation Flags.\nClick on At pendown trajectories in Segmentation Methods.\n\tNOTE: All of these adjustments for the default mode were done to improve the analysis of the Chinese handwriting.\n4. Parameter calculation\nRun the software, select the subjects in “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg”, and click on Handwriting Trials.\nUse the tracing system and trace the handwriting process and stroke order of “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg” step by step.\nFind the segmentation of stroke #3 of “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg” and read out the “Average Absolute Velocity” in “extracted data”.\n\tNOTE: The handwriting analysis software will automatically calculate the “Average Absolute Velocity” of each segmentation.\n\tCAUTION: Stroke #3 of “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg” is a horizonal movement (from left to right) of the pen tip that is shorter than Character 1 and Character 5 (Figure 1A).\nFind the segmentation of stroke #4 of “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg” and read out of the “Average Absolute Velocity” in the “extracted data”.",
    "CAUTION: Stroke #4 of “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg” is a vertical movement (from up to down) of the pen tip that is shorter than Character 2 (Figure 1).\nRead out the “Pen Pressure” of each segmentation in the “extracted data” and obtain an “Average Pen Pressure” of “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg”.\n\tNOTE: The handwriting analysis software will automatically calculate the “Average Pen Pressure” of each segmentation.\nRun the software, select the subjects in “imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61841/61841equ06.jpg”, and click on Handwriting Trials.\nUsing the tracing system, trace the handwriting process and stroke order of the signature step by step.\nFind the segmentation of the stroke between the characters and read out the “Absolute Size” and “Road Length” in the “extracted data”.\nObtain the in-air length tortuosity in the segmentation between characters according to the equation.\n\tNOTE: The segmentation of the stroke between characters was an in-air segmentation (Figure 2).\n\t\nCalculate the in-air length tortuosity: 1-Absolute Size/Road Length %.\n\t\tNOTE: Tortuosity, defined by the ratio of the arc length to the Euclidean distance between end points, is a measure of curvature, and therefore indexes the smoothness of a specific writing output20. A highly tortuous curve has several bends or curves, whereas a low tortuous curve is one with relatively wide loops/curves and more straightness.\n\t\tCAUTION: Most Chinese names are composed of two or three characters. If the signature has two characters, there is only one segmentation of stroke between characters. If the signature has three characters, there are two stroke segmentations between characters. In-air length tortuosity in the segmentation between characters would be an average value.\n5. Statistical analysis\nEvaluate group differences using a Student’s t-test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Conduct all statistical analyses using the SPSS 22.0 statistical software package.\nSubscription Required.
