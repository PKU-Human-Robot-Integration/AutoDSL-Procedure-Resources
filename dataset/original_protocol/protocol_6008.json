    "Drosophila larval dissection and preparationThe Drosophila third-instar larval dissection has been described and video recorded (Brent, 2009), and the basic background for TEVC electrophysiological preparation, configuration, and recording has also been outlined (Kyriacou, 2010). Suction pipettes should be pulled with an opening of ~5 μm, while the recording electrodes should be pulled with resistances of ~15 MΩ (Figure 2). Polish the tip of the suction pipette using the microforge listed in the equipment, and fill both recording micropipettes with 3 mM KCl and the suction pipette with 3 mM Ca2+ modified HL-3 saline with microfill and syringe (Stewart et al., 1994; Dickman et al., 2005). Additional details of electrode preparation have been previously detailed in Zhang and Stewart (2010b).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181227/20181227020020_0341.jpgFigure 2. Examples of recording and suction electrodes. A. Representative recording electrode tip pulled by using the puller program described in Equipment. B. Representative suction electrode tip pulled by the program detailed in Equipment and polished to a diameter of ~5 μm. A magnetic recording chamber (shown in Figures 3A and 3B; detailed in Ramachandran and Budnik, 2010) is used. The magnetic tape is necessary to attract the pins to the chamber and to hold down the filleted larvae while performing electrophysiology. While any glass can be used to form the foundation, a 3”x 4” chamber is a standard size that can be purchased cheaply and thus is what most experimentalist will prefer to use. A simple razor is used to manually cut out the diamond shape area of the magnetic tape in the middle of the chamber, and a simple glue gun is used to seal the edges between the glass and the magnetic tape around the diamond cut out. This glue seal is used to hold the saline around the dissected larvae while performing electrophysiology.",
    "Alternatively, a 60 mm dish lined with Sylgard and sharp pins can be used to impale the filleted larvae for electrophysiological preparation (Singh and Wu, 1999; Budnik and Ruiz-Canada, 2006; Imlach and McCabe, 2009; Zhang and Stewart, 2010a and 2010c; Itoh et al., 2016; Bykhovskaia and Vasin, 2017). However, we recommend and prefer the magnetic chamber because of the gentler dissection, the lower saline volume necessary and the superior microelectrode accessibility.Dissect third-instar larvae in ice-cold Ca2+ free modified HL-3 saline (to prevent muscle movement during dissection). The recipe of the Ca2+ free modified HL-3 saline is the same as the modified HL-3 without CaCl2. Loosely pin the larvae (Figures 3A and 3B), remove the guts, trachea and ventral nerve cord from the larval body walls. Cut all motor nerves that originated from the ventral nerve cord (Figure 3C) and perfuse the preparation several times with fresh HL-3 saline via pipetting. Ensure that the motor nerves are not cut too short, as this may result in difficulty with suctioning and stimulating the nerve. Finally, fill the chamber with 3 mM Ca2+ modified HL-3 saline.Orient the NMJ preparation on the microscope stage for optimal electrode positioning (Figures 3C and 4A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181227/20181227020113_9342.jpgFigure 3.

Note that optimal positioning of recording electrodes (schematized in black) and the stimulation pipette (schematized in blue).Electrophysiological recordingsPlace the larval preparation and the tips of the three electrodes in the middle field of view using the 4x objective, and lower the electrodes closer to the plane of the preparation.",
    "We typically record from muscle 6 at abdominal segments A2 or A3. Switch to the 40x objective, move the target muscle close to the electrodes, and lower the suction electrode near the nerve bundle. Provide a small negative pressure through the syringe to withdraw the nerve into the pipette. Use suction to establish a seal between the suction electrode and the motor nerve that innervates the muscle segment (Figure 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181227/20181227020138_3011.jpgFigure 4. Schematic illustrating the TEVC recording configuration of the third-instar larval NMJ. A. Picture of the electrophysiology setup, with electrodes placed to stimulate and record from the larval preparation. B. Schematic of a dissected third-instar larvae with a detailed view of the muscle 6 NMJ after all electrodes are properly positioned. A stimulating electrode is used to suck the severed motor nerve innervating the muscle segment to be recorded from (top) and the recording electrodes are used for current injection or voltage following (bottom). The presynaptic nerve terminal (blue) is shown in a classical “beads on a string” bouton structure.Move the recording electrodes right above muscle 6, which is innervated by the motor nerve isolated in the stimulation electrode (Figures 3C and 4B). Set electrode baseline potentials to 0 by resetting the bridge balance and pipette offset. Chloride the silver wire in the recording pipette if the pipette offset value is higher than 100 mV. Digitize electrophysiological sweeps at 10 kHz by setting the sampling rate in the Clampex software, and filter the lowpass signal at 1 kHz. Impale the muscle 6 fiber with the voltage follower electrode (HS-9Ax0.1) and record the resting potential (Vrest). Inject a 500 msec pulse of -1 nA current to measure the muscle input resistance (Rin) by Ohm’s law: Rin=Vrest/(-1 nA).",
    "Reject recordings with Vrest more depolarized than -60 mV or more hyperpolarized than -85 mV, or if the Rin is less than 5 MΩ.Impale the same muscle fiber with the current injection electrode (HS-13Sx10) and wait for 15-20 s until the voltage potential readings from both electrodes become stable (both more hyperpolarized than -55 mV). Switch to TEVC mode, clamp the muscle membrane potential at -70 mV, and monitor the leak current. Reject recordings with leak current values higher than 10 nA. Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) are recorded in the absence of any stimulation for one minute with a typical gain value of 80. Stimulate motor axons to elicit excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) using an ISO-Flex stimulus isolator (A.M.P.I.) to modulate the amplitude of stimulatory currents. Adjust intensity for each recording to consistently elicit responses from both neurons innervating the muscle segment, but avoid overstimulation, in which case responses with multiple peaks can be initiated.Switch to the protocol necessary to measure the RRP using the same optimal stimulation intensity established in the previous step. The RRP protocol stimulates evoked responses and records EPSCs using a 60 Hz train of 30 stimuli in 3 mM extracellular Ca2+ HL-3 (Figure 5). The train sweeps were repeated for five times in each recording. The train of stimulus at a high Ca2+ concentration leads to a progressive depression of EPSC amplitude during the stimulation paradigm due to a depletion of readily releasable vesicles (Figure 5B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181227/20181227020203_5696.jpgFigure 5.

    "A line fit to the 18-30th stimuli was back extrapolated to time 0; this y-intercept value is divided by the mEPSC value to determine the size of the RRP."
