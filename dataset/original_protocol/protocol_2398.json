    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol begins with the collection of tumor and normal lung tissue samples, which are then mechanically and enzymatically digested to prepare a single cell suspension. The mixture of cells originating from lung tissue is then further fractionated based on the presence of the epithelial marker epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), also known as CD326. Both healthy and cancerous epithelial cells express EpCAM. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 40%–85% of adenocarcinomas (ACs) and 85%–98% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are reported to be EpCAM+ (Went et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Kim et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nLung tissue-derived single cells are labeled with EpCAM (CD326) antibody conjugated magnetic MicroBeads for positive selection of epithelial cells from both normal and tumor tissue. Different fractionated cell types (tumor EpCAM+, tumor EpCAM–, and normal EpCAM+) are then tested for drug sensitivity and resistance, and cell viability data is analyzed to identify cancer-cell selective drug vulnerabilities.\nCollection of normal lung and tumor tissue samples\nTiming: 15 min\nCollection of viable (non-necrotic) tissue samples is a critical step to achieve a maximum yield of viable cells. This step of the protocol highlights the factors that need to be considered while collecting tissue samples.\nCollect tumor and tumor-adjacent normal lung tissue samples from surgically resected tumors lung lobe/s carrying tumor/s (lobectomy) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2036-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection of tumor and normal tissue\n(A) Surgically removed tumor-bearing lung lobe.\n(B) The pathologist cuts the tumor site in the middle and removes a 3–4 cm section of the tumor for the FUTC processing. Reserve 1–3 cm3 of tissue pieces for the FUTC assay.\n(C) Normal tissue is sampled from the same lung lobe, from a region adjacent to the tumor.",
    "Note: A trained thoracic surgeon or pathologist should dissect tumor and normal lung tissue because it is critical to collect fresh and viable tissue samples for efficient cultivation and further analysis. To dissect tumor and normal tissue areas, separate sterile scalpels should be used.\nImmediately after dissection, collect the tissue pieces in 30 mL of ice cold HBSS containing antibiotics (100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin).\nUse separate tubes for collecting normal or tumor tissue pieces.\nTransport the samples to the cell culture laboratory using a styrofoam ice box with a closed lid.\nAfter reaching the cell culture lab, transfer tissue pieces to sterile petri plates and wash gently three times with ice-cold HBSS containing antibiotics.\nNote: Give a gentle wash to tumor tissue pieces. Washing fragile tumor tissue pieces vigorously can lead to the detachment of small tissue fragments in the solution, resulting in the loss of material.\nAfter the last wash with HBSS, add 3.7 mL of ice-cold DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium.\nUsing a scalpel, cut the tissue pieces into smaller pieces for analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein, as well as for preparation of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks.\nImmediately after HBSS wash, snap freeze ∼0.5 cm3 samples of the tumor and normal tissue for DNA and protein extraction and store at –80°C.\nFor RNA extraction, submerge a piece of <0.5 cm3 tissue samples in approximately 5× volumes of RNAlater solution at room temperature (20°C). Store at –80°C.\nTo prepare FFPE blocks, place >0.5 cm3 tissue samples in histo cassettes and mark the cassettes with a histology marking pen that is resistant to formalin, ethanol, isopropanol, and xylene.\nReserve 1–3 cm3 of tissue pieces for the FUTC assay.\nMechanical dissociation of normal lung and tumor tissue samples\nTiming: 15 min",
    "Mechanical digestion of the sample will break down the larger tissue pieces into smaller fragments, allowing effective further dissociation using an enzymatic procedure. This part of the protocol demonstrates how to dissociate normal and tumor tissue samples using a Miltenyi Biotećs gentleMACS Dissociator (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2036-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mechanical and digestion of the lung tissue pieces\nPlace the tissue material in a sterile petri dish and add 3.7 mL of ice-cold DMEM medium. Using a scalpel, chop the tissue pieces as small as possible. Transfer the chopped tissue pieces to the MACS C tube and run the preset program on the MACS dissociator designed for lung tissue dissociation. To ensure proper tissue dissociation, incubate the tissue pieces at 37°C on rotation at 50–100 rpm. Collect the single cell suspension by straining the dissociated tissue pieces through a 70 μm cell strainer. Centrifuge the cells to pellet, discard the supernatant and resuspend them in fresh DMEM medium.\nCritical: This procedure should begin immediately following the surgical resection.\nMove the tissue pieces into sterile glass petri plates at room temperature and add ice-cold DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium without FBS.\nRemove all excess fat, fibrotic, and necrotic areas from the sample.\nCut the tissue into small 1–2 mm pieces with a sterile scalpel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: It is important to work quickly and keep the samples cold on ice until initiating mechanical dissociation. This will minimize the loss of cell viability.\nEnzymatic dissociation of normal lung and tumor tissue samples\nTiming: 90 min\nPrepare the enzyme mix by adding 1 mL of DMEM (or RPMI 1640) medium, 200 μL of enzyme H, 100 μL of enzyme R and 25 μL of enzyme A to a gentleMACS C tube.",
    "Alternatives: A mix of collagenase and dispase can be used instead of MACS enzymes, and RPMI 1640 can be used instead of DMEM.\nNote: Lower volumes of DMEM and enzymes are recommended for processing smaller tissue samples. For tissue samples smaller than 1 cm3, use half of the volume of the enzyme mix (2.5 mL in total).\nTransfer the tissue samples minced using a scalpel into a gentleMACS C tube containing the DMEM and enzyme mix.\nClose the C tube tightly and attach it upside down to a gentleMACS dissociator.\nNote: Ensure that the tissue pieces are in the enzymatic dissociation mix and not attached on the walls of the tube.\nRun the gentleMACS preset ‘program h_tumor_01’ recommended for lung tissue.\nDetach the gentleMACS C tube from the dissociator when the spin is over.\nIncubate the sample in the incubator for 30 min at 37°C under continuous rotation at 50–100 rpm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCritical: After step 11, cool the centrifuge to 4°C.\nAttach the gentleMACS C tube upside down into a gentleMACS dissociator and run the preset ‘program h_tumor_02’.\nRepeat steps 11 and 12.\nTo collect the sample material at the bottom of the C tube, perform a brief centrifugation step: 200 × g for 4 min at room temperature (20°C).\nResuspend the sample in the medium contained in the C tube.\nPlace a 70 μm cell strainer on a new 50 mL falcon tube and moisten the strainer surface with 5 mL DMEM to enable efficient cell straining later.\nTo obtain a single cell suspension, strain the cell suspension in the C tube through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nWash the cell strainer with 10 mL of fresh medium.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 7 min at room temperature (20°C) and aspirate supernatant completely.",
    "Resuspend the cells in a 5 mL of F-medium.\nCount the number of cells.\nNote: It is recommended that cells are stained with trypan blue before cell counting to accurately count only the viable cells.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 × g at 4°C for 10 min. Aspirate the supernatant completely.\nEnrichment of epithelial cells using EpCAM purification\nTiming: 2 h\nEpCAM-based enrichment is a widely used strategy to isolate patient-derived epithelial tumor cells from various tissue types, including solid tumors, peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, and serous effusions. The enrichment of epithelial cells using MACS EpCAM monoclonal antibody-conjugated magnetic MicroBeads, involves the labeling of epithelial cells in cell suspension and the positive separation of these cells by loading the samples onto a MACS Column placed in a strong magnetic field. Cells labeled with magnetic MicroBeads are retained while unlabeled cells pass through the column. Labeled cells can then be collected by removing the column from the magnetic field.\nCritical: Before beginning the EpCAM+ cell enrichment, make sure that all reagents have been pre-cooled. Also, keep the cells on ice and work fast during the next few steps. Taking these precautions will prevent antibody capping on the cell surface and will avoid non-specific cell labeling. A few recommendations for speeding up the operations are mentioned below.",
    "Note: MACS columns are available in three sizes: MS, LS, and XS. MS columns can separate maximum 2 × 108 total cells or maximum 107 EpCAM+ cells. LS columns can separate maximum 2 × 109 total cells or 108 EpCAM+ cells. XS columns can separate maximum 2 × 1010 total cells or maximum 109 EpCAM+ cells. The column size should be determined by the total number of cells or the quantity of tissue samples available. In the step-by-step protocol below, instructions are provided for magnetic separation using the LS column. Use the same volumes as specified when working with less than 107 cells. To process large cell volumes, several columns can be used with OctoMACS and SuperMACS II separators. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol to process a total cell numbers greater than 2 × 1010 www.miltenyibiotec.com/FI-en/products/octomacs-separator-and-starting-kits.html[href=http://www.miltenyibiotec.com/FI-en/products/octomacs-separator-and-starting-kits.html] - gref.\nCritical: In case clumps are formed see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 2 for solutions.\nCritical: Sodium azide is present in reagents. When exposed to acidic conditions, sodium azide produces hydrazoic acid, which is toxic. Before discarding azide chemicals, they should be diluted with running water.\nResuspend the cell pellet using the cold EDTA-BSA buffer. For 5 × 10⁷ cells, add 300 μL of EDTA-BSA buffer.\nPer 5 × 107 total cells, add 100 μL of EpCAM (CD326) MicroBeads (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2036-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Isolation of epithelial cells using anti-EpCAM antibodies labeled with magnetic beads\nGently pipette the suspension up and down to mix well and break up cell clumps.\nIncubate the cell suspension for 30 min in the refrigerator (2°C–8°C).\nAfter incubation is over, wash the cells by adding 10 mL of cold EDTA-BSA buffer per 5 × 10⁷ cells and centrifuge at 300 × g at 4°C for 10 min.",
    "Note: During the centrifugation step (step 27), assemble the column and magnetic separator. Attach the MACS Separator to the MACS MultiStand. Insert the MACS column into a MACS Separator, making sure that the column's wings fit into the Separator’s notch provided to insert the column. Put a collection tube below the column. Lastly, prepare the column by adding 3 mL of cold EDTA-BSA buffer to it. Discard the flow-through and place a fresh collection tube under the column.\nAspirate the supernatant completely and resuspend the cell pellet using the cold EDTA-BSA buffer. Add 500 μL of EDTA-BSA buffer per 108 cells.\nApply the cell suspension onto the MACS LS column and collect the flow-through, which mostly contains EpCAM– cells. This fraction can be used as an EpCAM– control for drug sensitivity testing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nRemove any remaining unlabeled cells in the column by washing the column four times with 3 mL of EDTA-BSA buffer.\nNote: As soon as the column reservoir is empty, start the next round of washing by adding EDTA-BSA buffer. Do not allow the column to dry.\nImmediately after all the washing steps are over, remove the column from the separator and place it on a fresh 15 mL collection tube.\nApply 5 mL of cold EDTA-BSA buffer onto the column and push the plunger firmly into the column to flush out the magnetically tagged EpCAM+ cells.\nNote: To attain a higher purity of EpCAM+ cells, the positively selected cell fraction from step 32 must be separated over a second fresh MACS column by repeating steps 29–32.\nCentrifuge both the EpCAM– and EpCAM+ flow-throughs at 300 × g at 4°C for 10 min. Aspirate the supernatant completely and discard it.",
    "Resuspend each of the cell pellets in 3–5 mL of F-medium and count the total number of cells.\nCalculate the volume and cell number required for drug sensitivity testing. We recommend usage of 384-well plates, 2,500 cells per well, robotic dispensing of cells, and testing each condition at least in duplicates.\nNote: If the number of cells is not sufficient to test several drugs and a robotic dispensing facility is not available, a few drugs can be manually tested using the following steps (46–49).\nDrug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT): Robotic reagent dispensing\nTiming: 1–2 h\nRobotic dispensing of cells and reagents allows improved accuracy and speed, which are both important factors in optimizing the protocol for diagnostic test development. However, the use of a robotic dispenser increases the required number of cells since the priming step (done to wet the tubing and tips with the same solution that will be dispensed later; doing this step prior to dispensing improves accuracy) requires an extra number of cells. Furthermore, robotic dispensing can also be used for precise dispensing of CellTiter-Glo, a reagent used in this assay to measure cell viability at 0 h.\nNote: When exposed to cellular ATP, luciferase in the CellTiter-Glo produces a luminescent signal; thus, the luminescent signal produced by CellTiter-Glo is proportional to the number of metabolically active cells in the well.\nRemove the drug plates from the storage pod.\nIn addition to drug plates, seed tumor-derived EpCAM+ and EpCAM– cells as well as EpCAM+ cells derived from normal healthy tissue into two empty 384-well plates for cell viability assessment at 0 h and 72 h.\nUsing Biotek MultiFlo FX RAD (MultiFlo), drug sensitivity testing can be performed using the following procedures (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2036_4.csv",
    "aIncubate the DSRT and (72 h) viability plates for 72 h after cell seeding.\nbCellTiter-Glo dispensing is only done for the 0 h viability plates.\ncEvery time the equipment is operated, maintenance tasks involving washing and emptying MultiFlo cassettes are carried out. After each usage, the cassette should be immediately cleaned to prevent clogging.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2036-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. FUTC-based pharmacological screening\n(A and B) Drug sensitivity and resistance testing with (A) robotic and (B) manual reagent dispensing methods.\nNote: While preparing MultiFlo, make sure that the flow of liquid from the tip is steady and fully vertical. To troubleshoot dispensing errors, backflush is recommended with sterile Milli-Q and 70% ethanol.\nCritical: Before cell seeding, ensure that the cell suspension is homogeneous and break any cell clumps by pipetting up and down.\nNote: To dispense multiple cell types, repeat the ‘preparing MultiFlo’ step and priming with F-medium before cell seeding. Also, prepare the appropriate volume of medium and reagents for two or more plates.\nOptional: To avoid edge effects in viability and drug sensitivity testing plates, do not use wells at the edge of the plate. For robust assessment, measure viability in at least ten replicate wells.\nImmediately after cell seeding, place the plate on a plate shaker at 300 rpm for 5 min to dissolve drugs and to achieve uniform distribution of cells.\nIncubate DSRT plates after cell seeding for 72 h at 37°C.\nTo measure cell viability at 0 h, 25 μL CellTiter-Glo can be dispensed using MultiFlo (see details of the dispensing program in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nNote: Warm up the CellTiter-Glo ahead of time so it may be utilized as soon as the 0 h plates are ready for viability readout measurement.\nNote: After dispensing CellTiter-Glo, wash and empty the MultiFlo cassette according to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].",
    "To induce cell lysis, place the 0 h cell viability plate on the plate shaker at room temperature (20°C) for 5 min.\nTo remove the bubbles, spin the plate for 5 min at 200 × g.\nRecord the CellTiter-Glo luminescence signal using a plate reader compatible with the CellTiter-Glo-based assay.\nAfter the 72 h incubation (step 40), add CellTiter-Glo and proceed as in steps 41–44.\nDrug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT): Manual reagent dispensing\nTiming: 2 h\nManual dispensing of cells or drugs is an option in case the robotic facility is unavailable or the number of cells is insufficient for robotic dispensing. Instead of adding cells to the drug plates, in the manual reagent dispensing approach, cells are first added to the empty wells of the 384-well culture plate on the day of sample processing. The, next day, after overnight (20 ± 4 h) incubation, drugs are manually dispensed on top of the cells, and the plates are subsequently incubated for 72 h. CellTiter-Glo is added on the cells and its luminescence signal is recorded at the end of incubation. The steps outlined below describe how to manually execute FUTC-based drug sensitivity testing.\nIn a 384-well plate, manually seed the EpCAM+ cells from step 36 (2,500 cells per well in 15 μL of medium). Place the plate on a plate shaker at 300 rpm for 5 min to achieve uniform distribution of cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nAfter overnight (20 ± 4 h) incubation, add the different drug concentrations on top of the cells in 10 μL of medium.\nPlace the plate on a plate shaker at 300 rpm for 5 min to dissolve drugs.\nIncubate for 72 h and analyze viability with CellTiter-Glo as described in steps 41–44.\nDrug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT): Data analysis\nTiming: 2 h",
    "To analyze drug sensitivity data, an interactive web-based interactive portal called BREEZE can be employed (Potdar et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). BREEZE is a one-stop solution for extracting various data features from drug sensitivity testing, such as EC50, IC50, area under the curve (AUC), and drug sensitivity score (DSS). BREEZE’s dynamic data visualization tools enable systematic data analysis and exploration at many levels. BREEZE can be found at http://dsrt.fimm.fi[href=http://dsrt.fimm.fi] or http://breeze.fimm.fi[href=http://breeze.fimm.fi].\nNote: The video tutorial available on the BREEZE website is an excellent starting point for getting acquainted with the DSRT data analysis protocol. This video tutorial can be found at the BREEZE website http://breeze.fimm.fi[href=http://breeze.fimm.fi].\nAlternatives: Although the BREEZE portal is recommended for evaluating the DSRT data because it accelerates the process and provides visual insights into data quality and analysis, basic data analysis may also be done with MS-excel and GraphPad Prism. Excel may be used to calculate percent viability for each data point, and GraphPad Prism can be used to plot dose response curves. To compare drug responses, IC50 values generated in GraphPad Prism can be used instead of the DSS values.\nData submission\nThe Breeze data analysis portal accepts a variety of data input formats, but drug names, their concentration ranges, and CellTiter-Glo measurement raw reads are essential for DSRT data analysis. The raw CellTiter-Glo readout values are used to calculate the percentage inhibition for each data point based on the negative (DMSO) and positive (benzethonium chloride) control values on the corresponding plate. To support the data submission step, a template of the data input structure is available for download (https://breeze.fimm.fi/DSRT_documentation/docs.html[href=https://breeze.fimm.fi/DSRT_documentation/docs.html]).\nVisit the BREEZE online portal at http://dsrt.fimm.fi/[href=http://dsrt.fimm.fi/] or http://breeze.fimm.fi/[href=http://breeze.fimm.fi/].",
    "Click the browse button under the ‘Data analysis process’ tab and upload the annotation file with the CellTiter-Glo raw data from the drug screen. The annotation file should include positive and negative controls, which are represented as ‘POS’ or ‘BzCl’ and ‘NEG’ or ‘DMSO’ under the ‘Drug name’ columns. The example annotation file is depicted in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2036-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Example annotation file for drug screen data analysis using BREEZE\nSelect viability as a readout.\nSelect the 4PL curve-fitting algorithm.\nSelect DSS2 as a DSS method.\nDepending on the requirements, different clustering algorithms can be used.\nWhen the uploading of the input data file is complete, press the Start button, and a progress bar will appear.\nWhen the data is processed, the “Check Results” button becomes active, allowing you to view the results. The link to the “Final report” can be emailed to the user.\nData analysis: Quality control\nTechnical errors during drug screening processes like spatial plate variability, errors in dispensing, edge effects due to uneven evaporation of the plate edges, in addition to poor cell viability/metabolic activity or elevated cell death of FUTCs can significantly compromise the overall data quality. Therefore, keeping track of the potential errors is crucial before performing the actual data analysis. Data analysis using the BREEZE portal provides information on the multiple quality control parameters like Z′ factor, strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD), signal/background ratio, SD, coefficient of variation, and central tendency of controls. Z′ factor, a screening window coefficient that indicates data robustness, is primarily used to assess data quality before any further analysis. Screens with a Z′ factor value less than 0.2 were not considered for further analysis.\nData analysis: Drug response",
    "Breeze provides several options for combining dose response data into a single metric, including IC50, EC50, AUC, and DSS. DSSs were generated to compare drug responses across samples using dose response curve metrics such as the IC50, slope, top, and lower asymptotes (Yadav et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5])."
