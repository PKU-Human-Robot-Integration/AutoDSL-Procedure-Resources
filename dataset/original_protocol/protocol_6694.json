    "Cell Culture and Acini GrowthNote: A complete description of cell culture protocols, cell line development, and growth of acini structures are reported by Zhang et al. (2019). Culture and maintain MDCK II cells following standard cell culture protocols for thawing, feeding, and passaging. Incubate cells at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment. Cell culture medium ingredients and their corresponding concentrations are provided in the Recipes section of this protocol.Induce acinar formation of MDCK II cells in an 8-well chamber slide one week prior to performing the mechanical indentation measurement.Coat an 8-well Nunc Lab-Tek chamber slide with Matrigel by spreading 40-45 µl of Matrigel in each well of the chamber slide. Incubate for at least 30 min at 37 °C or until the gels have completely solidified.Trypsinize MDCK II cells following standard cell culture procedures. Centrifuge the cells at 125 x g for 15 min and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the MDCK II cells into MDCK acini indentation medium. MDCK acini indentation medium ingredients and their corresponding concentrations are provided in the Recipes section of this protocol.Seed the MDCK II cells into Matrigel coated 8-well chamber slide at a seeding density of ~5,000 cells/well with MDCK indentation medium. Incubate the chamber slides at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment for approximately 7 days or until the MDCK cells have formed glandular acini structures.Transfer the acini structures into a glass bottom Petri dish for the indentation measurement.Coat the glass bottom Petri dish with 0.01 wt% poly-L-lysine. Place 200 µl of 0.01 wt% poly-L-lysine into glass bottom Petri dish and let sit for 1 hr. Remove the poly-L-lysine solution and rinse with 1x PBS solution. The poly-L-lysine should prevent any slippage of the acini structure during the indentation process.Remove the acini from the Matrigel growth matrix.",
    "Wash the acini in Matrigel coated 8-well chamber slide with a 1x cold PBS solution at 4 °C. Incubate the Matrigel coated 8-well chamber slide containing the grown acini in a 1x PBS solution supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaVO4, and 1.5 mM NaF to remove the Matrigel growth matrix from the acini structure. Isolate the acini structures from the Matrigel support matrix by centrifuging at 4 °C for 15 min at 125 x g. Remove the supernatant and rinse the resulting pellet with a 1x PBS solution prepared at 4 °C. Centrifuge the acini structure again for 15 min at 125 x g and remove the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet into a 1x PBS solution at 4 °C and transfer the acini into poly-L-lysine coated glass bottom Petri dishes at a seeding density of ~1,000 acini/Petri dish. It is important to keep the acini density relatively low in the glass bottom Petri dishes to avoid contacting multiple acini structures during the indentation experiment.Dye the acini structures with calcein AM to check the viability of individual acini and enable fluorescence confocal microscopy of the acini during the indentation process. Replace the PBS solution with the appropriate cell growth medium supplemented with 1:2,000 parts calcein AM cell dye. Incubate the acini for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment. Remove the medium and calcein AM solution and replace with fresh cell culture medium. Continue to incubate the acini at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment until it is time to perform the indentation experiment.Instrument Set-UpMount the bio-indentation instrument and Petri dish support plate onto the confocal microscope.",
    "The bio-indentation instrument mounts onto the confocal using the condenser slot; slide the mounting flange of the bio-indentation instrument into the condenser slot and tighten the mounting screw until the bio-indentation instrument is securely mounted. Place the Petri dish support plate into the plate adapter on the confocal microscope’s translational stage. Connect the Petri dish support plate to the temperature controller and power supply unit, and adjust the power settings to maintain a temperature of 37 °C.Coat the indentation tip with F-127 pluronic to mitigate the effects of adhesion between the glass indentation tip and the acini structure. Remove the indentation tip from the double-leaf cantilever beam by unfastening the mounting screw from the mounting nut. Plasma clean the indentation tip using the O2 plasma cleaner for 1 min. Immediately after plasma cleaning, submerge the indentation tip into a 0.1 wt% F-127 pluronic solution for 10 min. Rinse the indentation tip with a 1x PBS solution before remounting the indentation tip onto the double-leaf cantilever beam.Adjust the height of the capacitance probe to ensure the double-leaf cantilever beam is within the detection range of the capacitance probe. The capacitance probe should be close enough to detect the cantilever beam but far enough away that the deflection of the cantilever beam during the indentation stays within the detection limits of the capacitance probe.Align the indentation tip over the center of the microscope objective. Beginning with the lowest magnitude objective, lower the indentation tip and adjust the objective focal point until the indentation tip is within focus. Using the XY linear translational stage, adjust the location of the indentation tip to align the center of the indentation tip with the center of the microscope’s field of view.",
    "Install the reflectance filter cube into the confocal microscope’s detector unit and load the reflectance imaging settings in the NIS-Elements software (Figure 2B). Adjust the focal plane of the confocal microscope to find the apex of the indentation tip. Continue to align the center of the indentation tip with the center of the microscope’s field of view.Repeat the alignment steps using progressively higher objective magnifications until the indentation tip is centered directly above the 20x microscope objective. It is recommended to use the 1.5x optical zoom feature during the indentation. Once the indentation is aligned over the microscope objective, remove the reflectance cube from the confocal microscope’s detector unit, re-install the 438/24 filter cube, and select the DAPI/FITC/TRITC imaging settings in the NIS-Elements software (Figure 2A). It is recommended at this time to check the indentation tip for any debris that may cause irregular surface contact between the indentation tip and the acini structure.Secure the glass bottom Petri dish on the confocal microscope’s translational stage. Place the glass bottom Petri dish containing the acini structures onto the Petri dish support plate. Secure the Petri dish to the support plate using the two mounting arms.Determine the location of the glass surface of the Petri dish and zero the indentation instrument’s force and displacement values. Navigate to a region in the center of the Petri dish in which there are no acini present in the microscope’s field of view. Initiate the indentation software and zero the force and displacement measurement. Drive the indentation tip 100 µm toward the surface of the Petri dish using the piezoelectric z-stage; at this time, the indentation tip should not be in contact with the surface and the force measurements should be fluctuating about 0 N.",
    "Manually lower the indentation instrument using the focal adjustment of the condenser stage until the indentation tip comes into contact with the glass surface as evident by a sudden and drastic increase in the measured force along with a decrease in the noise in the force measurement. Once contact with the surface has been made, slowly raise the indentation instrument using the focal adjustment of the condenser stage until the indentation tip is no longer in contact with the surface and the measured force returns to 0 N. Raise the indentation tip 100 µm using the piezoelectric z-stage. The indentation tip should now be located ~100 µm above the glass surface of the Petri dish – high enough to avoid contact with acini structures when moving the confocal microscope’s translational stage, but low enough to achieve contact during the indentation measurement.Mechanical Indentation of Acini StructureMechanical indentations of glandular acini structures are performed to determine the average applied pressure at which the acini structures mechanically fail. The indentation tip is slowly brought down into contact with an individual acini structure at a fixed indentation rate while the applied force is recorded with simultaneous fluorescence imaging of the cells. As the indentation force exceeds the background level of noise in the measured force, the acini structures are observed to flatten out. Further increasing the applied force results in continued deformation of the acini until there is a structural collapse resulting in the formation of cellular blebs and/or the bursting of cells (Figure 4A). These rupture events are captured in the fluorescence images of the deforming acini enabling us to pinpoint the time at which the first rupture event occurs (Figure 4B).",
    "After the initial rupture, the indentation tip continues to push into the acini structure until the measured applied load reaches the specified maximum indentation force. Once the maximum indentation force is achieved, the indentation tip pulls off the structure at the designated indentation rate, returning to the starting z-position. To perform the mechanical indentation of an acini structure:Locate an isolated acini structure and align it in the center of microscope’s field of view, directly beneath the indentation tip. It is important that the acini structure is isolated within the microscope’s field of view to avoid contact with other acini structures. It is recommended to use brightfield imaging while locating the acini structures to avoid prolonged exposure of the acini structures to the confocal laser and photobleaching of the fluorescence dye.  Misalignment of the acini structure can lead to irregular surface contact between the indentation tip and the acini resulting in improper force measurements as the indentation tip comes into contact with the glass substrate prior to the acini structure rupturing. A sudden, near vertical increase in the force vs displacement curve is a strong indicator that the acini structure is not properly aligned with the indentation tip.Navigate the focal plane of the confocal microscope to the desired imaging plane for the indentation measurement. It is recommended to choose a focal plane that is close to the bottom of the acini structure to fully capture the deformation during the indentation process (Figure 4A); a focal plane chosen too high may result in the acini structure deforming out of the imaging plane prior to the rupture event occurring.Note: It is optional to perform a confocal z-scan at this time to capture the shape of the acini structure prior to the indentation measurement. Prepare the confocal microscope for the indentation measurement.",
    "Initiate perfect focus in the confocal software and adjust the region of interest and the capture delay of the confocal software to achieve the fastest framerate possible. A higher framerate during the indentation measurement will result in an improved temporal resolution when determining the rupture pressure of the acini structure.Prepare the indentation instrument for the indentation measurement. Within the indentation instrument software, set the parameters for the indentation rate and maximum indentation force. We recommend using an indentation rate of 0.1 µm/s and a maximum indentation force of 100 µN. Faster indentation rates will reduce the temporal resolution of the fluorescence images captured throughout the measurement. A slower indentation rate will improve the temporal resolution when determining the rupture pressure but will increase the experimental time and laser exposure of the cells. The maximum indentation force should be set sufficiently high enough that the acini structure ruptures before the maximum force is reached. From our experience, a 100 µN maximum indentation load was sufficiently high enough to induce rupture of the acini; however, a higher maximum indentation force will not alter the results of the measurement.Simultaneously initiate the indentation measurement of the acini structure and the imaging time-lapse on the confocal microscope. Record any discrepancies in start times of the indentation measurement and imaging time-lapse."
