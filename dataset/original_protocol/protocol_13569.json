  "procedures": [
    "All mouse experiments were approved by the Laboratory Animal Center of the E-DA Hospital/ I-Shou University and were handled according to the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" (NRC, USA 2011). Male C57BL/6 mice, 7-8 weeks old, were used for the present study.\n1. Chemical preparation\nPrepare the chemical irritant by diluting 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate (CG, see Table of Materials) in 15% ethanol.\n2. Animal treatment\nAssign three mice as the control group. Perform intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of 1 mL/kg of 0.9% normal saline (NS) every other day for 3 weeks, for a total of nine times.\nAssign three mice to the peritoneal fibrosis group. Induce peritoneal fibrosis using chlorhexidine gluconate (CG) by administering i.p. injections of 0.1% of CG in 15% ethanol (step 1.1) at a dose of 12.5 µL/g body weight. Perform this every other day for 3 weeks, for a total of nine times.\n3. Peritoneal function tests (modified peritoneal equilibration test)\nPrepare a dialysis solution containing 4.25% glucose. Draw 0.5 mL of dialysate sample with a syringe, and then check the glucose concentration in the dialysate sample.\n\tNOTE: The glucose concentration is determined according to the hexokinase/G6PD method. Dialysate samples were accessed to L-type Glu 2 assay and investigated with a biochemical analyzer (see Table of Materials). This is the initial dialysate glucose concentration.\nAnesthetize the mice by intramuscular injection of Zoletil and Xylazine (prepared in a ratio of 1:2 by volume, see Table of Materials) at a dose of 20 µL/20 gw. Additionally, use vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness under anesthesia.\nPerform i.p. instillation of the dialysis solution (2 mL/20 g bodyweight).",
    "After 30 min, assess and verify the depth of anesthesia with lack of toe pinch reflex. Then, perform a vertical incision in the midline of the abdominal (beneath the xiphoid process), then open the mice's abdomen and collect the intraperitoneal fluid with a syringe (defined as \"volume 1\"). Then, measure the weight of a clean and dry cotton and put the cotton into the mice's abdominal cavity to absorb the residual intraperitoneal fluid. Finally, measure the cotton weight again.\n\tNOTE: The weight gain of cotton is equal to the weight of the residual intraperitoneal fluid. Then, convert to the obtained volume (specific gravity: 1 g/cm3; defined as \"volume 2\"). The final dialysate volume is volume 1 plus volume 2.\nUse 0.5 mL of dialysate sample (final dialysate) to measure the glucose concentration. This is the final dialysate glucose concentration.\nCalculate the net ultrafiltration using the formula15:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63903/63903eq01.jpg\nCalculate the peritoneal permeability using the following formula15:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63903/63903eq02.jpg\n4. Tissue preparation of the abdominal wall muscle and liver and histological analysis\nSacrifice the mice via cardiac puncture (phlebotomy)3,16.\nCut the abdominal wall (1 cm x 1 cm) and total hepatectomy. Fix the mice's abdominal wall and liver tissues overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nPrepare 3 µm thick paraffin sections of the abdominal wall muscle and liver, and perform histological analysis following previously published report17.\nEvaluate the parietal peritoneum of the abdominal wall and visceral peritoneum of the liver surfaces of the mice using morphometry18.\nPerform statistical analyses using statistics and graphing software (see Table of Materials). Express all data as mean ± SD and analyze for statistical significance using a t-test19. Define values with P < 0.05 as significant results.\nSubscription Required.
