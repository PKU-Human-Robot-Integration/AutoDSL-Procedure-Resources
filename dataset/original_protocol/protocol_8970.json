    "The procedures described here for anesthesia, euthanasia, and cardiac perfusion of mice were performed under a protocol approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of RNase-free Instruments and Solutions\nRNase is a common contaminant of all laboratory surfaces, including bench tops, micropipettes, and the investigator.\n\t\nChange gloves often or regularly wipe with a RNAse decontaminating solution.\nStainless steel dissection tools and glassware can be made RNase-free by heating at >200 °C for 1 hr or more. Note: Steam sterilization does not destroy RNase. Alternatively, wipe with a RNase decontaminating solution, then with RNase-free 70% ethanol and air dry.\nWipe bench tops, other lab surfaces and micropipettors with RNase decontaminating solution, then with RNase-free 70% ethanol. Designate a specific lab bench or work area for RNA recovery and analysis. Note: Remove tip ejectors before wiping the shafts of the pipettors and leave them off, if possible.\nUse tubes, microcentrifuge tubes, pipettes, and micropipette tips that are certified by their manufacturer to be RNase-free. Use of very-low binding tips and microtubes is recommended. If possible, use freshly opened boxes or bags of these components and keep them separate from the general lab supply.\nObtain RNase-free solutions [Dulbecco’s calcium and magnesium-free PBS (PBS), ethanol, RNase-free 70% ethanol] from commercial sources. Use newly opened bottles for each experiment.\nThe source of the Azure B dye is critical to successful recovery of intact RNA. Test each batch of dye before committing precious samples to staining and collection. Collect a few thousand neurons from a nonexperimental animal, prepare RNA, and determine the RNA integrity as described below to find one that consistently produces RIN numbers above 8.5.",
    "Dissolve Azure B dye (1%, wt/vol) in RNase-free 70% ethanol, typically 0.3 g in 30 ml ethanol in a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Mix well on a rocker at RT overnight or until all the particles have dissolved. One tube of this solution can be used to stain multiple slides without affecting the staining intensity.\nAs a precaution, use a different tube of stain for each biological replicate.\nUse the cryomolds and O.C.T. for embedding cord sections without further treatment.\nMaintain the cryostat at -20 to -24 °C. After sectioning, place the slides in a -80 °C freezer until a sufficient number has been prepared. Start RNA preparation as soon as possible after the slides have been made. For long-term storage, keep unsectioned or partially sectioned OCT blocks, rather than slides, at 80 °C.\nMake the guanidine thiocyanate buffer for RNA preparation from the dissected motor neurons using the solutions provided by the RNA preparation kit manufacturer according to its directions.\n2. Preparation of Spinal Cord Sections from Mice (Figure 1A)\nClean all the dissection tools, glass slides, razor blades, and dissection platform by baking or wiping with RNase decontaminating solution, followed by RNase-free 70% ethanol. Let dry for 2 min. Keep everything dust-free by covering with lab wipes.\nAnimal handling procedures, including anesthesia, cardiac perfusion, and euthanasia, should be carried out according to the requirements of the local institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC), with the goal of rapidly bringing the animal to the point of spinal cord dissection.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal (ip) injection of a lethal dose of Ketamine (450 mg/kg).",
    "Once a deep level of anesthesia is achieved and confirmed by lack of a toe-pinch response, position the mouse ventral side up on a dissection platform (a Styrofoam board, for example), open the chest cavity to expose the heart, and insert the 27 G butterfly needle of an infusion set into the left ventricle (which is on the investigator’s right). Nick the right atrium with a sharp forceps, and perfuse with PBS at a rate of 5-7 ml/min for about 2 min using a peristaltic pump. The liquid flowing from the atrium should be largely free of blood at this point.\nRemove the perfusion needle, decapitate the mouse, and turn it over on the dissection board. Open the skin to expose the spinal column, use small scissors and forceps to remove the vertebrae, and lift out the spinal cord while severing the nerve roots with a sharp forceps. Speed and practice are essential in moving from the start of the perfusion to removal of the cord; this should take no more than 7 min.\nRinse the cord for 10 sec in RNase-free water to wash off any residual blood. Lay the spinal cord on an RNase-free glass slide with a curved forceps very gently but quickly. Divide the spinal cord transversely using a clean razor blade into 9-10 pieces.\nPlace the pieces in a cryomold filled with O.C.T. using the same forceps, and align them vertically using a clean needle. Place the mold in a shallow tray containing 2-methylbutane precooled with liquid nitrogen, and then put the tray into a liquid nitrogen bath to fast-freeze the spinal cord pieces to avoid RNA degradation.",
    "Store the OCT-embedded block at -80 °C for up to 6 months before sectioning. The process from retrieval of the cord through freezing should be done within 5 min to maintain RNA integrity.\nCryosection the O.C.T.-embedded block at -20 °C with a cryostat to produce 20 µm slices, each containing 9-10 spinal cord cross sections, on RNase-free PEN-membrane 2 μm slides kept initially at room temperature to ensure that the sections adhere to the slide. Immediately refreeze the section on a -20 °C surface inside the cryostat. Keep the slides at -80 °C until used.\n3. Staining of Spinal Cord Sections (Figure 1A)\nOn a clean rack, arrange six 50 ml conical tubes. Fill all of them with 25-30 ml of RNase-free 70% ethanol, so that the depth is sufficient to cover all the sections on a slide when the slide is immersed. Make 30-35 ml of 1% Azure B solution as described earlier and keep it on the same rack to minimize time between changing solutions during washing or staining. Keep three or four lab wipes in front of the rack to drain extra solution quickly.\nTake the slides out of the -80 °C freezer onto dry ice. Thaw one slide by placing it on a gloved palm. Remove most of the moisture and condensation on the slide by wiping it off with a lab wipe, being careful not to touch the sections. Put the slide on fresh silica gel desiccant in a Petri dish for 30-40 sec to dry completely. If lab humidity is high, brief treatment in a vacuum dessicator can be used to dry the slide more quickly.\nWashing and staining.",
    "Dip the dried slide into the first tube of RNase-free 70% ethanol. Soak the slide for 30 sec, then wash the slide to remove the OCT by dipping it up and down for 45-60 sec . Take the slide out of the solution and drain the excess liquid on lab wipes. Repeat the same process by dipping the slide in the second tube of 70% ethanol. If the OCT around the spinal cord sections is not completely gone, repeat the washing in the third tube.\nAfter draining the excess liquid, submerge the slide in 1% Azure B solution in 70% RNase-free ethanol for 30-45 sec. Drain the excess Azure B on a lab wipe; at this point, the whole slide will be blue.\nSubmerge the slide in the next tube of 70% ethanol, and dip up and down quickly 3-4x to remove excess dye and to make the specific motor neuron staining visible. If the sections look very darkly stained, repeat the destaining step in a fresh tube of 70% ethanol. If the staining seems too light, return the slide to the Azure B solution for another 30 sec and repeat the destaining. Wipe off the excess ethanol and air dry the slide for ~40 sec until all the liquid is gone. The gray matter will be light blue, whereas the motor neurons will be stained deep blue, which is easily visible. Start the dissection immediately.\n4. Laser Capture Microdissection (LMD) (Figure 1B)",
    "Turn on the microscope and unload the tube holder to attach the cap of a 0.6 ml microfuge tube for sample collection. Put 30 µl guanidine thiocyanate lysis buffer into the cap of a 0.6 ml microfuge tube. Cover the surface of the cap with liquid by spreading the solution using a pipette tip. In this way, all the collected neurons will be dissolved in solubilizing solution as they are dissected. Align the cap with the hole and the objective with the microscope software. Keep the cap in the covered position until starting laser capture.\nPlace the air dried slide on the stage of the LMD microscope upside down, so that the membrane of the PEN slide faces down. The membrane with sections should face the hole, underneath of which is the collection tube.\nTurn on the laser 10 min before starting slide preparation. Focus on a spinal cord section with the 5X objective. Move to the 20X objective for dissection.\n\t\nMark a “dummy” region with the light pen and allow the laser to cut it out without collecting it. This relaxes the PEN membrane and makes it possible to mark and cut multiple regions successively.\nRefocus and identify motor neurons in the ventral horn region. These neurons are recognizable by their location, their pyramidal morphology, their large size, and their dark blue staining with Azure B (Figure 2).",
    "Using the light pen, select the drawing tool and mark along the edge of the motor neurons, making a complete outline. Try to make the outline as close as possible to the motor neuron to avoid contamination from cells other than the motor neuron. (Test some sections beforehand to see how wide the laser cut-line is and adjust the clearance as necessary.) Mark multiple cells before cutting; the software will remember the positions.\nBring the cap underneath the cutting position by clicking on the cap position. Click the start button to initiate motor neuron dissection with the laser. Collect all the motor neurons from all of the sections on one slide into the cap of one microfuge tube.\nAfter collection is complete, take the microfuge tube out of the holder by unloading the tray and gently dislodging the tube. Completely dissolve the motor neurons in the buffer by pipetting the solution up and down. Move the solution into the body of the tube by centrifuging at 14,000 x g for 2 min at 4 °C. Freeze the sample immediately in dry ice and store it at -80 °C. This process, from slide staining through motor neuron collection, should be done within 30 min for one slide to minimize RNA degradation.\n5. RNA Preparation from Motor Neurons\nThaw all of the collected neurons from one animal and pool them together to extract RNA. Samples may look pale blue depending on the number of motor neurons (stained with Azure B) in them. Extract RNA using a suitable kit according to the protocol provided for LMD tissue, eluting in the minimum volume possible. Take 1 µl to check the quantity and integrity of the sample. Fast-freeze the remaining RNA on dry ice and store at -80 °C.",
    "6. Determination of RNA Quality and Quantity\nDetermine the RNA quality with the 1 µl sample on a capillary electrophoresis microfluidics chip according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA preparations with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) above 8.5 can be used for RNA-seq and qRT-PCR. The data output also typically includes the approximate concentration of the sample."
