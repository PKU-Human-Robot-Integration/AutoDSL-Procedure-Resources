    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn the supplemental information[href=https://www.wicell.org#appsec2], there is a video showing crucial steps of training and testing session (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2], related to steps 3, 5–7 and 10–13).\nThe courtship conditioning or conditioned courtship suppression assay was described for the first time in Drosophila melanogaster in 1979 (Siegel and Hall, 1979[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Since then, the knowledge about this process has been greatly increased and it is summarized in detail by Raun et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]. The more generalized training for this protocol used to be three spaced 2-h trainings with 30 min resting intervals (Barajas-Azpeleta et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), although a single training of 5–7 h work similarly (Koemans et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). The latter protocol requires specific equipment and it is routinely employed by two different labs (Chubak et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Lei et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), This learning generates a robust long-term memory, lasting at least 5–9 days (Brenman-Suttner et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Inami et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). As other long-term memories, it is anesthesia sensitive (CO2 or ice cold). This memory is mainly generated by olfactory cues, but also involved visual inputs (Raun et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Avoid the use of vision- or smell-deficient mutant animals (for instance, white). Also, the strength of the female genotype is important for the rejection of the male: in our hands, CS mated females render a 15% of mating males whereas white mated females have a 30%–35% of successful mating.\nTraining session\nTiming: 6,5 h\nThis section describes the preparation and the training (i.e., learning) of male flies in order to induce learning and/or to generate memory (either short- or long-term). The aim is to select male flies that have been rejected by females from courting (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).",
    "Note: Prepare Mated Canton S females for Test in a tube with males (1:1 proportion), approximately 24 h before Test session start.\nCritical: For training and testing sessions, avoid the use of CO2 on experimental males. Use a neumocaptor instead (see Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E).\nGet pyrex tubes containing 5-day old naïve (unmated) males.\nPREPARATION:\nTrain 2/3 of the males (around 20 animals).\nPlace the pyrex tubes where they got mature in racks, trying not to cover other tube so the researcher can observe them without manipulating (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2331-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Training session\n(A) Example of the training session.\n(B) Cotton plug pushed down in order to promote fly interaction.\n(C) Two pyrex tubes containing two Drosophila couples. In the left one the male is doing the courtship, whereas in the right tube the male is actually mating.\nPlace the remaining 1/3 of flies in in racks nearby, to experience the same environmental conditions. These will serve as naive, non-trained control flies.\nTRAINING:\nIntroduce a mated female by aspiration in the tube of each male that is going to be trained (using the neumocaptor).\nOnce all tubes have a female, push the cotton plug near to the bottom down leaving a space of approximately 1.5 cm, in order to promote interaction. It can be done with the help of a forceps or with a pen. Try to push all the surface of the cotton to avoid flies from getting stuck between the plug and the tube wall (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nObserve flies every 15 min without disturbing and mating couples discarded from the experiment (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D). Drosophila mating lasts 20 min, at least.\nRemove wool cotton after 5 h of training cotton and retire kindly the female through aspiration.",
    "Put the cotton back, leaving the male alone in the pyrex tube.\nCritical: From this step on it is very important not to disturb experimental males. Examples of disturbing are switching lights on/off, loud noises, vibrations of the table where the racks are and rapid temperature changes.\nCritical: Temperature and humidity should oscillate between 19°C and 27°C and 50%–80%, respectively.\nNote: In our hands, a successful training using CS means around a 15% of mating males or above. Other female genotypes may render different ratios, given that this percentage depends on the “strength” of females.\nDifferent phases of memory formation can be studied with this protocol.\nLEARNING: Perform the test immediately or within a 15 min interval after the training session.\nSHORT-TERM MEMORY: Perform the test 1 h after training.\nLONG-TERM MEMORY: Perform the test 6–8 h after training (this is considered long-term memory). We typically do the assay 24 h after training. This requires a period of consolidation. Leave the males in their own tube in a temperature and humidity-controlled incubator for memory consolidation until test session starts.\nCritical: For long-term memory assays, it is very important not to disturb the experimental males during the critical period of consolidation. Examples of disturbing are opening/closing the incubator, altering the circadian rhythmicity, loud noises or vibrations by hitting the incubator.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "Critical: Use a room without any source of illumination but the one used in your experiments. The dark room diminishes distracting visual cues, something that may affect the test performance. Also avoid speaking or disturbing animals in any way.\nNote: Test arenas are 24-well plates and they can be reused. Please do not use soap, just running water.\nOPTION A (for traditional analysis).\nThis option is recommended for researchers that are not going to use assiduously the protocol or do not have the possibility to use an Automatized Tracking Program. Quantify manually the obtained video.\nIntroduce a male in each well (24 flies in a 24 wells plate) by aspiration with white high-dense plugs. Test the naïve males too.\nIntroduce a mated female in each well with the male.\nPush plugs down in order to create a 2D space (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2331-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Testing session\n(A) The plugged 24-well plate with animals included, ready to be recorded.\n(B) Example of the set up.\n(C) The 24-well plate with the transparent Tapino lids over the flies.\n(D) Example of the set up.\nRecord courtship behavior. Obtain a 10 min video at least (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nDiscard flies once they are recorded or keep if needed.\nNote: For white high-dense plugs, we cut the Drosophila Anti-Mite Vial plugs used for vials. Alternatively, commercial white foam can be cut to proper size.\nOPTION B (for automatized analysis).\nThis is the best option because it allows the use of an Automatized Tracking Program, which makes quantification much easier and less human-working time consuming. The weak point is that the tracking software may be not easy to implement.\nAspirate a female and a male and together introduce them in a well of the 24-well plate.",
    "Cover the well with the Tapino (3D-2D) lid and introduce the aspirator from one side. Test naïve males too.\nPress the Tapino lid until the bottom to create a 2-dimensional space which is highly important for the posterior tracking and analysis of the flies (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCover the plate with its own lid and flip it to check if all the flies are correctly placed and Tapino lids well situated.\nPlace the plate in the transilluminator, always in the same position.\nRecord courtship behavior. Obtain a 10 min video at least (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2331-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. The Tapino lid scheme, including dimensions\nThis 3D printed lid leaves a 3,5 mm space where flies can interact and behave comfortably, but in a 2-dimensional space that is a fundamental requisite for most automatic tracking programs.\nNote: To place the plate always in the same position, cut a piece of cardboard with the shape of the plate in the middle and place it in the transilluminator in such a way that it cannot move. Also mark the position of the tripod legs on the cardboard: the camera needs to be placed in the exact same position every time, otherwise illumination is modified and the posterior automatized analysis will not work properly (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: The Tapino lid is an in-house design and requires a 3D printer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2331-Mmc1.zip])."
