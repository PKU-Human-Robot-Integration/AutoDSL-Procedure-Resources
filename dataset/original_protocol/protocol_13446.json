    "All the procedures in the following protocol were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital for application on November 11, 2020. In this study, the process is explained to the patients in detail and the patients' consent is obtained before using electrophysiological technology for diagnosis and treatment.\n1. Patient selection\nSet the following inclusion criteria:\n\t\nSelect patients who score <22 points on the International Erectile Function Questionnaire-5 (IIEF-5).\nEnsure that the selected patients are generally in good health, married or have a fixed sexual partner, and can maintain normal sexual intercourse at least once a week from the beginning to the end of the study.\nEnsure that patients do not and have not taken any drugs to improve erectile function in the first 4 weeks.\nSelect patients whose reproductive hormone examination results are normal.\nSelect patients who voluntarily agree to participate in this study and give their signed, informed consent.\nSet the following exclusion criteria:\n\t\nExclude patients suffering from ED caused by hormones, nerves, or psychological factors.\nExclude patients with organic abnormalities in the penis (abnormal development of genitalia or abnormal palpation of the bilateral testis, epididymis, or spermatic cord).\nExclude patients with severe cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases who cannot have normal sex lives.\nExclude patients with a pacemaker implantation.\nExclude patients with poor blood pressure control (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg after treatment) and patients with poor glycemic control whose fasting plasma glucose is >7.0 mmol or 126 mg/dL after treatment.\nExclude patients with drug, alcohol, or other substance abuse history in the past 6 months.\nExclude patients with radical prostatectomy or pelvic surgery and those who have participated in any other medical device or drug clinical research studies in the past 3 months.",
    "2. Diagnosis and treatment process\nPreparation before inspection\n\t\nMaintain the ambient temperature of the infrared thermal imaging inspection chamber at 24 ± 2 °C and ambient humidity at 40% to 60%.\nProhibit the examinee from drinking alcohol, taking vasodilator and vasoconstrictor drugs, and eating food at temperatures over 40 °C (or any spicy food), 24 h before examination.\nFully expose the test area during the examination, removing bandages 2 h before the examination.\nProhibit the examinee from being exposed to high temperature, a strong cold environment, or being directly in the airflow from an air conditioner or fan 1 h before inspection. Loosen the pants belt, and remove watches, necklaces, and other items 15 min in advance.\nLet the examinee stand or sit quietly in the waiting area for 10 min.\nLocate the outliers.\n\t\nLet the patient enter the medical infrared camera inspection chamber, take off all their clothes, and face the scanning head.\nClick the motion capture bar button after posing, click freeze, and save each action (Figure 1).\nAnalyze the temperatures of different positions of patients under different movements, especially the penis, groin, and lower abdomen.\n\t\t\nConsider the penis position to be abnormal if the penis temperature is lower than 33.5 °C or higher than 34.5 °C (see Figure 2).\nConsider the groin position to be abnormal if the groin temperature is lower than 33.5 °C or higher than 34.5 °C (see Figure 2).\nConsider the lower abdomen position to be abnormal if the lower abdomen temperature is lower than 33 °C or higher than 34 °C (see Figure 2).\nAnalyze and determine the diagnosis and treatment plan.",
    "Analyze the treatment plan of the abnormal points on the computer equipment of the low-frequency neuromuscular therapy instrument and download it to the diagnosis equipment of the low-frequency neuromuscular therapy instrument after detecting the abnormal point.\nDetermine the abnormal points where the temperature anomaly was detected before, affix the electrodes one by one to the corresponding sites on the patient, and connect them to the computer equipment of the low-frequency (20-50 Hz) neuromuscular therapy instrument, as shown in Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5.\nObserve the real-time temperature change of each program acting on the abnormal point under infrared thermal imaging.\nSelect the fastest program that can be seen on the infrared imager for the temperature of the abnormal part to return to normal and determine the corresponding frequency and pulse width on the equipment of the low-frequency neuromuscular therapy instrument.\nPrecision electrophysiological therapy\n\t\nFind the corresponding plan on the Bluetooth equipment of the low-frequency neuromuscular therapy instrument.\nUse the Bluetooth equipment of the low-frequency neuromuscular therapy instrument to connect the patient's own mobile phone for treatment. Select a value at which the patient feels comfortable within the allowable frequency (20-50 Hz) and pulse width (0.02-0.3 ms) range once a day, for 12 stimulations as a course, and evaluate the effect after a course of treatment."
