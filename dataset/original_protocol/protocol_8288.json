    "All mice were housed in a humidity- and temperature-controlled, AAALAC-accredited animal facility at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. All experiments were approved by the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and conducted according to specifications of the NIH. \n1. Preparation of the Sample Extract\nAdherent cells\nPlate cells in 10 cm dishes in the appropriate culture media (1 x 106 to 1 x 109 cells per dish for cell lines, such as BV2, HEK-293, and SH-SY5Y, but ~1 x 1015 cells per dish for primary cells, such as primary cortical neurons). Assure that the cells are equally distributed on the entire surface of the plate and allow the cells to grow for 48 h to reach ~100% confluence (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nOnce the cells have reached the desired confluency, gently aspirate the culture media and wash the cells 2x with prewarmed serum-free media under a tissue culture hood.\nAspirate the serum-free media from the dish and add 1 mL of ice-cold extraction buffer (0.4 M sulfuric acid, 1 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0] and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail) to each dish.\nUse a plastic cell scraper to collect all cells in the extraction buffer (by scraping) and transfer them to a 1.5 mL labeled tube with a 1,000 µL pipette. Pipet the cells up and down 3x to facilitate homogenization.\nClose all tubes and immediately put them on ice.\nBrain tissue \nIf frozen tissue is being used, place the tissue in a prechilled 1.5 mL tube and briefly thaw it on ice. If fresh tissue is being used, proceed immediately to step 1.2.2.\n\t\tNOTE: The current protocol describes procedures using frozen mouse brain and mouse prefrontal cortex samples.",
    "Homogenize the tissue using a handheld Dounce homogenizer using the appropriate amount of extraction buffer and the recommended number of strokes (Table 1). To avoid excessive chromatin shredding, do not exceed the number of recommended strokes.\nUsing a single channel 1,000 µL pipette, transfer the homogenate to a prechilled 1.5 mL tube. Close all tubes and immediately put them on ice.\n2. Preparation of the Crude Histone Extract\nPlace the 1.5 mL tubes containing the cells or tissue suspended in extraction buffer on a rotating platform and rotate at 15 rpm at 4 °C to allow the extraction of crude histones.\n\tNOTE: The extraction time may vary for different cell and tissue types and must be optimized for each procedure. The current protocol presents results obtained following 15 min, 2 h, and 24 h of extraction (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5).\nPrechill the microcentrifuge to 4 °C. After the desired extraction time has passed, centrifuge the tubes at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant including the crude histones to a new, prechilled 1.5 mL tube. Discard the pellet.\nStore the supernatant at -80 °C (the extraction can be stopped at this step, see “Stop step” in Figure 1) or immediately proceed to the next step.\nNeutralize the crude histones with a 1/4 volume of 5x neutralization buffer (e.g., add 250 µL of 5x neutralization buffer to 1 mL of crude histones). Mix well by pipetting up and down 6x.\nCheck the pH of the mixture with pH strips. Adjust accordingly by adding more neutralization buffer to reach a pH of 7.\nEvaluate the presence of histone and nonhistone protein in the crude histone extract as follows (Figure 2).",
    "Add 37.5 µL of the sample to 12.5 µL of 4x (Laemmli) sample buffer and denature for 10 min at 99 °C.\nLoad the sample onto an SDS-PAGE gel and run the gel for 1 h at 100 V.\nStain the gel overnight with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining solution and destain during three consecutive washes (1 h/wash) with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 destaining solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Crude histones (Figure 2) can be compared with eluted and purified histones (i.e., column input [Figure 5A]).\n3. Purification of Core Histones\nSpin column equilibration \nAdd 500 µL of equilibration buffer to each spin column being used. Do not touch the column membrane.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C for 3 min at 800 x g. Discard the flow-through. Repeat 1x.\nHistone Purification \nAdd 500 µL of the sample of interest from step 2.6 to the column. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 3 min at 800 x g. Collect the flow-through.\nRepeat the previous step as many times as necessary to load the entire sample onto the column. Do not overfill the spin column.\nCombine the flow-through from each centrifugation step to analyze the column-binding efficiency (Figure 3).\nFollow step 2.7 to analyze the column flow-through.\nColumn wash \nAdd 500 µL of the wash buffer to each column. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 3 min at 800 x g. Collect the flow-through wash (wash #1).\nRepeat step 3.3.1 for a total of three washes. Collect the flow-through washes #2 and #3. Do not pool the consecutive column flow-through washes.\nTo further evaluate the column’s histone-binding efficiency, analyze the three column washes by following step 2.7 (Figure 4).\nHistone elution \nTransfer the column into a new labelled 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Add 50 µL of the histone elution buffer. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 3 min at 800 x g. Save the flow-through containing histone proteins.\nFor an additional elution, repeat step 3.4.2. Do not combine the first and second flow-through eluates as they differ in histone quantity and purity.\n4. Precipitation of Core Histones\nAdd perchloric acid (PCA) to the purified histones to a final concentration of 4% PCA (e.g., add 3 µL of 70% PCA to 50 µL of purified histones from step 3.4.2.\nCentrifuge for 3 s to collect all residual liquid from the tube wall. Mix by pipetting up and down 6x.\nPlace the tubes in a rack and incubate for 24 h at 4 °C.\nThe next day, prechill a microcentrifuge to 4 °C and centrifuge the samples for 75 min at maximum speed at 4 °C.\nAfter the centrifugation is complete, a small white pellet containing precipitated histones will be visible on the bottom of the tube. Do not vortex the sample.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and, without disturbing the pellet, add 500 µL of ice-cold 4% PCA to the sample.\nCentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min at maximum speed. Carefully aspirate the supernatant.\nRepeat step 4.7 2x.\nWithout disturbing the pellet, add 500 µL of ice-cold acetone. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min at maximum speed. Carefully aspirate the supernatant.\nRepeat step 4.9 2x.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant, leave the tubes uncapped, and allow the sample to dry on ice for 30 min. Check if all residual acetone has evaporated.\nLeave the tubes uncapped and allow the sample to dry at room temperature (RT) for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellet in 30 µL of sterile water. Do not pipet up and down. Flick the tube gently with a finger.",
    "Cap all tubes and allow the histones to reconstitute on ice for 30 - 50 min, depending on the pellet size. Check if the pellet is resuspended.\nCap all tubes and allow the pellet to further resuspend at RT for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: This solution (first and second elution from step 3.4.3) is constituted of purified and desalted histones and may be used for further quantification and histone acetylation analysis.\n5. Quantification of Eluted Histone Proteins\nUse a spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer’s protocol to quantify the total histone proteins obtained after the final elution in step 4.15. Measure the absorbance at 230 nm. Record the A260/A280 ratio indicative of the sample contamination with nucleic acid.\nUse the following formula to calculate the histone concentration (x):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58648/58648eq1.jpg\n\tHere, OD is the optical density measured at A230 nm.\nA histone concentration of ~1.5 mg/mL is considered an average yield for cell lines, while a histone concentration of ~5.0 mg/mL is considered an average yield for 30 mg of tissue.\n6. Western Blot Analysis\nAdjust the purified and eluted histone from step 4.15 to ~10 µg of histone protein/sample.\nAdd the appropriate volume of water and 4x Laemmli sample buffer to adjust the loading volumes.\nDenature the samples for 10 min at 99 °C. Cool them on ice. Centrifuge for 3 s to collect all residual liquid and condensation from the tube wall.\nLoad the samples onto an SDS-PAGE gel and run the gel for 1 h at 100 V.\nTo visualize total histone protein, stain the gel overnight with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining solution and destain during three consecutive washes (1 h/wash) with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 destaining solution.",
    "NOTE: The first elution of histone proteins contains high-quality histones (Figure 5A) while the second elution contains low to no levels of histones (Figure 5B).\nTo quantify histone PTMs, use a transfer system (see Table of Materials) to transfer the histone protein from the SDS-PAGE gel (step 6.4) onto a PVDF membrane.\n\t\nTo assemble the transfer sandwich, open the transfer system cassette and place the PVDF membrane stack (labelled as Bottom+) on the bottom of the cassette with the membrane facing up. Roll the membrane gently with a blot roller to remove any air from between the stack and the membrane.\nLay the gel on top of the membrane, roll the gel gently with a blot roller to remove any air from between the membrane and the gel, and place the top stack on the gel. Roll gently again and place the cassette cover on top of the sandwich, press down firmly, and turn the nob clockwise to lock.\nInsert the cassette to the transfer system slot. On the apparatus screen, select Turbo Protocol. Use a 3 min protocol for a single mini gel or a 7 min protocol for more than two mini gels.\nStain the membrane with Ponceau S stain for 5 min and visualize the total histone proteins.\nWash them in 1x Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h and block them in 5% milk for 1 h. Incubate with primary and secondary antibody (overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at RT, respectively) or according to a previously optimized protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: In the current protocol, antibodies against acetylated histones H4K12 (Figure 6 and Figure 7) and H3K27 (Figure 8) were used."
