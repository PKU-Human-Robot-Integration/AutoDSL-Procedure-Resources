    "Differential cysteine labeling and in-gel digestionNote: All washes that require mixing and incubations of samples are performed using Thermomixer R with a block that holds 1.5 ml tubes.To 6 µg of natural human αIIbβ3, add PBS to 25 µl.Note: For lyophilized proteins, a non-amide buffer with pH > 7.0 (e.g., PBS) is recommended for reconstitution. Add 2.2 µl of 50 mM 12C-IPA/DMSO solution to final 4 mM. Mix and incubate at 25 °C for 1 h in the dark.Note: Prepare fresh 12C-IPA/DMSO solution just before use. Discard any unused solution. Cysteine is a strong nucleophile, and its reaction with IPA should complete in 1 h. Extended incubation time with IPA is not recommended. Add 9 µl of NuPAGETM 4x LDS sample loading buffer and heat samples at 70 °C for 10 min. Analyze samples on non-reducing NuPAGETM 4-12% Bis-Tris gel in 1x MOPS running buffer at 150 V for 65 min. Stain protein gel with 40 ml of Coomassie Blue G solution at room temperature for 30 min. Remove Coomassie Blue G solution.Destain gel in destaining solution at room temperature until background becomes clear.Excise protein gel bands corresponding to β3 integrin (Figure 1) with a clean scalpel.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129002223_8238.jpgFigure 1. Analysis of αIIbβ3 integrin by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Bands corresponding to β3 are excised for subsequent in-gel processing of samples. A photo of Coomassie blue stained gel is shown.Dice gel band into small pieces of 1-2 mm3. Place gel pieces into a clean tube. Note: Use standard 1.5 tubes that are nuclease-free. Special low protein binding tubes are not required.  Add 150 µl of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate/50% acetonitrile buffer to gel pieces.Vortex gel pieces for 10 min at 25 °C using Thermomixer (Eppendorf). Remove supernatant by pipetting. Repeat Steps A9 and A10 for another 2 washes of the gel pieces.",
    "Dry gel pieces by adding 100 µl of 100% acetonitrile. Remove acetonitrile by pipetting.Note: Gel pieces should be completely dried out within 1-2 min. Can store dried gel slices after this step at -20 °C. Long-term storage of dried gel slices is not recommended. However, the dried gel slices stored under this condition should remain stable for 1 month or longer. Cover gel pieces with 80 µl of 40 mM DTT in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Incubate at 56 °C for 30 min. Remove supernatant.Wash three times with 150 µl of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate/50% acetonitrile buffer. Vortex each time for 10 min at 25 °C. Dry gel slices by adding 100 µl of 100% acetonitrile. Remove acetonitrile by pipetting. Note: It is not recommended to store gel pieces with proteins that contain free thiols generated from DTT reduction prior to alkylation with 13C-IPA. Gel pieces can be stored at -20 °C after alkylation with 13C-IPA, washed and dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile.  Prepare 50 mM 13C-IPA/DMSO solution and dilute it to 5 mM 13C-IPA in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer.Note: Prepare fresh 13C-IPA/DMSO solution and dilute it to 5 mM 13C-IPA/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution just before use. 5 mM 13C-IPA/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution can precipitate slightly. Discard any unused solution. Cover gel pieces with 100 µl of 5 mM 13C-IPA/25 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution and incubate in the dark for 1 h at 25 °C. Remove supernatant.Wash three times with 150 µl of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate/50% acetonitrile buffer. Vortex each time for 10 min at 25 °C.Dry gel slices by adding 100 µl of 100% acetonitrile. Remove acetonitrile by pipetting. Dry gel pieces in Speedivac for 15-20 min to remove traces of acetonitrile prior to enzymatic processing of gel pieces.",
    "Reconstitute 50 units of PNGase F in 100 µl ddH2O.Note: Any unused PNGase F can be stored at -20 °C. The enzyme remains stable for a few freeze-thawing cycles. For non-glycosylated proteins, skip PNGase F treatment (Steps A22-A28) and directly go to Step A29 to digest protein. Add 10 µl (5 units) of the reconstituted PNGase F to dried gel pieces and incubate at 37 °C for 15-30 min.Note: It is a very small volume to add to dried gel pieces, but it is not recommended to increase the volume of PNGase F by either diluting the enzyme or using more of the enzyme. Increased amount of PNGase F used can result in more PNGase F peptides that can distract the mass spectrometer in data acquisition. Add 25 µl of water to the sample such that the gel pieces are just covered by the liquid. Incubate at 37 °C overnight. Centrifuge briefly to collect condensation. Remove and discard supernatant from the samples.Wash gel pieces with 250 µl of water and vortex at 25 °C for 20 min. Remove supernatant. Repeat Step A26 twice for 2 more washes.Dry gel pieces in Speedivac until gel pieces are completely dried.Note: It may take up to 1 h to dry the gel pieces because of high water content. Reconstitute chymotrypsin with 1 mM HCl to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml.Note: Reconstituted chymotrypsin can be stored at 4 °C for 1 month. Dilute chymotrypsin to 12.5 ng/µl in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate/10 mM CaCl2 buffer.Add 35 µl of freshly diluted chymotrypsin to dried gel pieces and incubate at 37 °C for 4 h.Reconstitute trypsin with 50 mM acetic acid to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml.Note: Reconstituted trypsin can be stored in 5 µl aliquots at -80 °C for over a year.",
    "Dilute trypsin to 12.5 ng/µl in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer.Add 30 µl of freshly diluted trypsin to gel pieces and incubate at 25 °C overnight.Stop digestion of protein by adding 10 µl of 5% formic acid solution to sample.Transfer digest solution which contains peptides to a fresh tube.Elute remaining peptides from gel slices by adding 30 µl of 5% formic acid/50% acetonitrile solution to gel slices. Vortex for 20 min at 25 °C. Transfer supernatant to the tube containing peptides.Repeat Step A37 for another elution of peptides from gel pieces.Dry peptides with Speedivac with no heat applied. Peptide clean up and mass spectrometry analysisReconstitute peptides in 10 µl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Using a P10 pipet, wet the C18 Ziptip by aspirating 10 µl of wetting solution. Discard solution to waste.Note: Avoid introducing air to the C18 matrix when pipetting.  Repeat Step B2 for a second time. Equilibrate Ziptip using 10 µl of Equilibration buffer. Discard solution to waste.Repeat Step B4 for another two times. Bind peptides by aspirating 10 µl of the reconstituted peptide sample. Aspirate up and down no more than 4 times.Note: Do not aspirate more than 4 times as this will select for high-affinity peptides and lose peptides that only weakly bind to C18 matrix.  Wash column by aspirating 10 µl of Equilibration buffer. Discard wash to waste.Repeat Step B7 for another 2 times.Elute bound peptides using 5 µl of wetting solution by aspirating up and down 3 times in a clean tube. Dry peptides in Speedivac with no heat applied.Reconstitute peptides in 12 µl of 0.1% formic acid. Measure the concentration of peptide using a NanoDrop. Use 0.1% formic acid as blank.Dilute the peptide to 80 ng/µl with 0.1% formic acid.",
    "Inject 3 µl of peptides (200-250 ng) into a Thermo Scientific Dionex Ultimate 3000 and analyze peptides on a 35 cm x 75 μm C18 reverse phase analytical column with integrated emitter using a gradient of 2%-35% acetonitrile over 22 min (Table 1) with a flow rate of 300 nl/min.Note: Mass spectrometry analysis is best to be performed at a proteomic facility where technical support can be provided to set up the method to run peptide samples. The intensity of the TIC peaks should be in the range of 1E9-1E10.Table 1. Solvent gradient used in LCimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190129/20190129002317_5755.jpgAcetonitrile gradient for peptide elution is highlighted. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis is performed on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using HCD fragmentation. Set electrospray ionization of peptides at +2.0 kV. The scan range for full MS is set at 350 to 1,750 m/z. The spectrum data type for full MS is profile mode whereas for MS/MS is centroid mode.Data-dependent acquisition method is used to obtain MS/MS spectra of the top 10 most abundant ions at any one point during the gradient."
