    "Ethics statement: All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined in the federal regulations as set forth in the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), the 1996 Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the PHS Policy for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and all animal work was approved by the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #: MO12M465).\n1. Preparing the Inoculum of Mid-logarithmic Bioluminescent Bacteria\nStreak bioluminescent S. aureus strain Xen29 (or another bioluminscent strain such as Xen36) onto tryptic soy agar plates (tryptic soy broth in agar [1.5%]).\n\tNOTE: S. aureus Xen2921 is a genetically engineered S. aureus strain that contains a modified lux operon derived from Photorhabdus luminescens, which is integrated into a stable native plasmid found in this bacterial strain. These engineered bacteria constitutively emit light from live and metabolically active cells.\nGrow the colonies on the plates by incubating them at 37 °C for approximately 16 hr (O/N).\nSelect single bacterial CFU and culture in shaking liquid TSB (240 rpm) for approximately 16 hr (O/N).\nPerform a sub-culture with 1/50 dilution of the O/N culture to obtain mid-logarithmic growth phase bacteria (approximately 2 hr duration).\nPellet, resuspend and wash the bacteria 3x in PBS.\nEstimate the bacterial inocula (1 x 103 CFU in 2 μl PBS) by determining the optical density absorbance at 600 nm.\nVerify the CFU in the inoculum after culturing the bacteria O/N on plates.\n2. Mouse Surgical Procedures",
    "NOTE: For these experiment, use a twelve-week old male LysEGFP mice. These mice possess enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expressing myeloid cells (which consist of mostly neutrophils)20. Maintain sterile conditions during surgery and after surgical prep with betadine and 70% alcohol by placing each mouse on a sterile drape on top of a hard surface water circulating heating pad. Use gown, sterile gloves, mask and sterilize instruments.\nAnesthetize the mouse using a 2% inhalation of isoflurane. Use vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Assess the appropriate level of anesthesia by observing the respiratory rate, muscle tone, toe pinch, corneal reflex and color of mucous membranes. Cover the mice with a sterile surgical drape with a hole at the surgery site on the right knee. The mouse should get supportive heating measures to maintain body temperature while under anesthesia. Warm 37 °C water circulating in a warm water jacketed blanket or a water circulating hard plastic heated workstation (ProStation, Patterson, Scientific) are good ways to prevent hypothermia.\nInject buprenorphine (sustained-release formulation) (2.5 mg/kg) subcutaneously just prior to surgery. Additional doses of sustained-release buprenorphine may be administered at 3 day intervals as needed for analgesia.\nShave the operative knee and prep using three alternating scrubs using betadine and 70% alcohol.\nPerform a midline incision in the skin overlying the right knee joint. Extend the skin incision so that the extensor mechanism can be well defined.\nPerform a medial parapatellar arthrotomy and sublux the quadriceps-patellar tendon extensor mechanism laterally with an Adson forceps.\n\tNOTE: This brings the intercondylar notch of the femur into plain view.\nManually ream the intramedullary canal using a 25 G needle followed by a 23 G needle.",
    "Note: To avoid damage to femur, a stabilizing platform can be used. This should be important to the technique to minimize an accidental fracture of the femur.\nInsert a medical-grade titanium Kirschner-wire (0.8 mm diameter) by using a press-fit technique, which entails manually pushing it using a pin holder, in a retrograde direction into the intramedullary canal.\n\tNOTE: Titanium K-wires were used as there were fewer artifacts seen on the μCT images with titanium K-wires compared with stainless steel K-wires 16.\nCut the end of the Kirschner-wire with pin cutters so that the cut end of the K-wire extends approximately 1 mm into the knee joint space.\nUsing a micropipette, pipette 2 µl of 1 x 103 CFU of bioluminescent S. aureus Xen29 onto the tip of the implant within the knee joint space.\n\tNOTE: More volume leads to wider tissue contamination and less discrete imaging.\n\tNOTE: In control uninfected mice, add 2 µl of sterile saline without any bacteria.\nReduce the quadriceps-patellar complex back to midline using forceps and close the overlying subcutaneous tissue and skin using absorbable subcuticular sutures.\n\tNOTE: Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nAt the end of the experiments, euthanized all animals using carbon dioxide inhalation according the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Verify death by observing the animal fails to recover within 10 min after carbon dioxide exposure ends and cervical dislocation.\n3. 2D Optical Imaging (In vivo Bioluminescent and Fluorescent Imaging)\nAnesthetize LysEGFP mice (e.g. 2% inhalation isoflurane) and place them with ventral side up into an imaging chamber.",
    "Perform in vivo bioluminescent imaging using the IVIS Spectrum optical whole animal in vivo imaging system. First, check Luminescent and confirm the choice of an open filter selection, field of view (FOV) C - 13 cm, and scroll exposure time down to Auto (autoexposure setting). Autoexposure will automatically adjust acquisition time (shutter speed), binning (digital pixel binning), and f-stop (aperture) of the instrument to optimize signal intensity while avoiding saturation. Then click Acquire to capture the bioluminescent image.\n\tNOTE: For in vivo bioluminescent imaging, image mice between 1 - 5 min.\nPerform sequential in vivo fluorescent imaging by checking the box next to Fluorescent. Choose the 465 nm excitation filter and 520 nm emission filter. Scroll exposure time down to Auto and select FOV C (Step 3.2.1). Then click Acquire to capture the fluorescence image.\n\tNOTE: For in vivo fluorescent imaging, image mice between 0.5 sec.\nQuantify the in vivo bioluminescent signals as total flux (photons/sec) in a region of interest (ROI) using Living Image software by first expanding the ROI Tools section of the Tool Palette.\n\t\nSelect the Circle Icon and the number of ROIs which correspond to the number of subject animals in the FOV. Resize the ROI to encompass the region of interest i.e., the bioluminescent diffusion pattern collected.\nSelect Measure ROIs in ROI Tools in the Tool Palette and the ROI Measurement Window will appear. Total Radiance (photons/sec) values represent the sum of bioluminescent pixels within the generated ROI.\nChoose the SELECT ALL and COPY tabs in the bottom right hand corner of this window will transfer the information to the clipboard and allow pasting into subsequent programs for analysis.\nQuantify the in vivo fluorescent signals as total radiant efficiency ([photons/sec] / [µW/cm2]) within a circular region of interest (ROI) using Living Image software.",
    "Within the Living Image software window, expand ROI Tools in the Tool Palette. Select the Circle Icon and the number of ROIs which corresponds to the number of subject animals in the FOV.\nResize the ROI to encompass the region of interest corresponding closely to the bioluminescent signal from the previous image acquisition.\nSelect Measure ROIs in ROI Tools in the Tool Palette and the ROI Measurement Window will appear.\n\t\tNOTE: Total Radiant Efficiency ([photons/s] / [µW/cm2]) represents the sums of fluorescent pixels within the ROI.\nSelect All and Copy tabs in the bottom right hand corner of this window will transfer the information to the clipboard and allow pasting into subsequent programs for analysis.\n4. μCT Image Acquisition\nPlace the anesthetized LysEGFP mice into an imaging chamber.\n\tNOTE: This imaging chamber is designed to fit in both the IVIS Spectrum imaging system and the Quantum FX in vivo μCT imaging system to allow co-registration of the optical and μCT images.\nOpen the CT software and select the Menu preset 60 mm FOV std dynamic from the dropdown.\nInsert the large bore cover and the adapter arm for the imaging shuttle into the instrument.\nPlace the mouse imaging shuttle into the adapter arm then push the arm into the bore and close the door. Turn on Live Mode (the Eye Button on the Control Panel) and position the subject at the 0° and 90° gantry position using the X-axis and Y-axis controls to center the animal in the X capture window. Then turn off Live Mode by clicking the Eye Button.",
    "Acquire a dynamic scan image with the 60 mm FOV by clicking the CT Scan button (next to the Live Mode Button). Export the acquired image in the DICOM format and store in a location that can be accessed later.\n\tNOTE: The approximate dose will be 26 mGy per scan. A 30 mm FOV can be used if better resolution is desired.\n5. 3D Optical Image Acquisition, Formation and µCT Co-registration\nPlace the mouse imaging shuttle insert into the Spectrum by positioning the imaging shuttle containing the mouse into this insert and ensure the mouse does not move.\nUsing Living Image, select Imaging Wizard in the Acquisition Control Panel to begin the wizard setup. To start, choose Bioluminescence, then DLIT, and then select the reporter “Bacteria” from the dropdown menu and the appropriate emission filters for the model will be chosen automatically, in this case, 500 - 620 nm.\n\t\nSelect Next, then designate the acquisition parameters and subject information in the final window. Specifically, Imaging Subject will be Mouse, Auto Settings will be selected allowing autoexposure to maximize signal quality while avoiding saturation, and Field of View will be set to C - 13cm.\nSelect Finish in the final window and the sequence window of the Acquisition Panel will be automatically populated with the DLIT sequence. There will be one image acquired per emission filter chosen and autoexposure will choose optimal settings at each wavelength as per the Imaging Wizard selections. The generated sequence also includes a structured light image needed for subject surface generation via the Surface Topography tool detailed below.\nSelect Acquire Sequence to acquire the DLIT data.\nAfter the image acquisition is complete, generate the surface topography. Start by expanding the Surface Topography tab under the Tool Palette.",
    "Next, select the orientation that accurately reflects the side of the animal facing the camera or top of the IVIS instrument. Then click Generate Surface. Crop the region of the FOV that contains the animal.\nThen use the purple mask to define the bounds of the animal.\n\t\tNOTE: The masking tool uses color contrast so animals with dark fur or skin will not mask appropriately from the stage.\nSelect Finish and the surface will appear automatically. Save the result under the Surface Topography tab then close the tab as we will no longer need it.\nReconstruct the 3D optical source position using the diffuse optical reconstruction algorithms implemented in Living Image22 by expanding the DLIT 3D Reconstruction tab.\n\t\nImages acquired for the DLIT sequence are shown.\n\t\tNOTE: The software automatically verifies quality of the acquired data and will deselect images deemed too dim or where saturation is present. Select Start on the bottom right-hand side.\nIf required, one can adjust the threshold for each bioluminescent image by double clicking and using the thresholding slider on the bottom left hand side.\n\t\tNOTE: this is mainly to include lower intensity signal and caution should be practiced when thresholding higher as this may adjust overall intensity of the final reconstructed source.\nWhen satisfied with the threshold, select Reconstruct to automatically run the reconstruction algorithms which will result in a 3D representation of the optical source.\nOpen the DICOM browser by clicking the 3D icon in the Tool Bar at the top of the software (third from left) and search for the Quantum FX image acquired previously.\n\t\nLoad this image into the Living Image 3D View tab by double clicking on the file for import.",
    "NOTE: The fiducial should be automatically detected and result in the μCT image being registered with the 3D optical image.\nDeselect the surface topography visualization map by expanding 3D Optical Tools in the Tool Palette and deselecting the check box labeled Display Subject Surface in the Surface tab.\nManually create a lookup table to visualize the skeleton and the K-wire implant that are visible in the μCT image using the histogram under the Volume tab of the 3D Multi-Modality Tools section of the Tool Palette.\n\t\nThe histogram represents the distribution of voxel intensities in the 3D volumetric data and their color opacity. To determine where the particular tissue of interest is in the histogram, use the slider tool to threshold the rendering until the tissue or structure is visible.\nThen right click in the histogram to generate points and form a curve to isolate that area of the histogram. This will be repeated for each structure – skeleton followed by the K-wire implant and can be saved as a lookup table for future analyses.\nComponents can be color coded if so desired by double clicking any generated point in the histogram and selecting the desired color from the pop up window.\n6. μCT Image Visualization and Analysis\nUsing the Quantum FX software, select the image of interest and launch Viewer. Select the rotate tool and reorient the image to visualize the longitudinal axis of the femur. Select the measurement tool and measure the femur length.\nLaunch the 3D Viewer to generate 3D renderings. Adjust the threshold to show the changes in bone anatomy associated with implant infection.\nApply clipping planes so that the 3D rendering is limited to the desired cross-sectional section of the area of interest in the distal femur.",
    "Launch the Analyze 11.0 software package. Load the *.VOX file that was used to create the 3D rendering.\nLaunch the Image Calculator tool. Use the ‘Region Pad’ tool to crop the image (remove planes that don’t include the femur).\nLaunch the Oblique Sections tool. Use the 3 points option to find points at the middle of the femur, greater trochanter and the end of the pin. Make these points an oblique plane and generate an image with new slices.\nLaunch the Region of Interest tool. Display the transaxial slices. Adjust the min and max settings to display the cortical bone. Create contours for the slices corresponding for a several slices (with an approximate interval of 5 slices) for the slices corresponding to the distal 25% of the femur. Use the ‘Propagate Regions’ tool to interpolate between these contours and create a 3D region of interest. Save this region of interest as an object map.\nLaunch the ‘Sample Options’ tool. Select the checkbox for the object map that was just created and select the radio buttons for the appropriate options. Click the ‘Configure Log Stats’ button to confirm that the ‘Volume’ checkbox is selected. Click the ‘Sample Images’ button to make the actual measurements.\nExport the volume measurements into a data analysis program. Normalize the outer bone volumes from later time points to the first imaged time point using the formula: Δ Volume (%) = ([Volume(day X) – Volume(day 2)]/[Volume(day 2)]) x 100.\n\tNOTE: In this formula, the variable “X” represents the time point of interest. The resultant number will represent the change in the size of outer bone volume of the distal femur over time.",
    "To visualize the 3D region of interest on top of the bone, load the CT image in the ‘Volume Render’ tool. Load the object map containing the 3D region of interest. Go to ‘View’’Objects’ and set the ‘Original’ to be ‘On’. Open the ‘Preview’ window. Launch the ‘Render Types’ menu and select ‘Object compositing’.\nClick the ‘Threshold’ button and tool and adjust the thresholds to show the bone and object map. Use the same fixed threshold range for all time points. Click the ‘Rotation’ button and set the orientation to be a true anterolateral view. Click ‘Render’ to generate the final rendering. Save the rendering from the main ‘Volume Render’ window."
