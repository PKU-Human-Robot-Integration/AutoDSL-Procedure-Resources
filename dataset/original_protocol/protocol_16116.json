    "In this first section, we describe the protocol to generate callus starting from dry mature seeds. This method utilizes dehusked seeds, followed by sterilization and plating in callus-inducing medium to generate high-quality callus. The resulting callus is amenable to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation when implemented as described below.\nMaterials\nS. viridis (ME034V-1) seeds\n               \nNote that ME034V-1 = ME034V.

The bottom surface of the float and the base tray inner surface are lined with a corrugated plastic sheet with a ribbed side facing outwards.

Remove seed coats from 2-3 g of dry seeds (dehusk the seeds; Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0002]). We use a homemade device shown in Figure 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0002] for the removal of the seed coat. Avoid applying too much pressure on the seeds, as it could damage the embryos. Remove chaff and seeds that retain their seed coat (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0002] and 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0002]).\n2. Sterilize the dehusked seeds in a 50-ml conical tube filled with 40 ml of sterilization solution made with 10% bleach plus 0.1% Tween-20 for 10 min on rotating mixer at 30 rpm (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c3f830e9-07eb-4c8f-92a9-94849a7893c1/cpz1127-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nVarious steps of seed sterilization.

This orientation is important for the development of high-quality, regenerable callus compared to seeds with the embryo side plated touching the medium surface (Fig. 4C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0004]). Wrap plates with plastic wrap or Micropore tape and place plates in a growth chamber maintained at 24°C with a photoperiod of 16 hr for 1 week (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005]) followed by 4-5 weeks incubation in the dark at 24°C.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c5c88111-43b5-4701-a7e4-782dad1430b7/cpz1127-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nSterilized seeds plated on CIM medium to initiate callus.

Incubate newly sub-cultured calli in the dark at 24°C for 1 week (Fig. 5C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005] and 5F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0005]) prior to transformation with Agrobacterium (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-prot-0002]).\nCallus quality is the most important factor in achieving high and reproducible transformation frequencies. When possible, use the youngest available material that has reached a size of 2-4 mm. Subsequent sub-culturing of poor-quality callus onto new medium results in a significant decline in the transformation efficiency.—",

Remove all medium that is still attached to the roots by rinsing with RO water before placing the plantlet into the designated cell. Cover the roots with soil by gently tapping the soil around the root mass and stem base. Do not compress the soil excessively, as this can lead to root and plant stunting (Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0010]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3261d7a2-ffcf-4026-b110-654b88f86f9e/cpz1127-fig-0010-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 10\nTransplantation of plantlets from tissue culture medium to soil.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all plantlets have been transplanted to soil.\n6. Place flats with plantlets in the greenhouse with a Humi-Dome and spray with RO water 2-3 times daily for approximately 3 days after which the Humi-Dome is removed.\n7. Supplement bottom water as needed 1-2 times per week with Jack's 20-20-20 fertilizer mixed at a concentration of 200 ppm.\nIt takes approximately 2-3 weeks for plants to begin to develop inflorescence.\nOptionally, a total dissolved solids (TDS) meter can be used to test and confirm the ppm of the solutes in the water.\n8. Bag plants with maturing inflorescence, which have approximately ¼ of their seeds dark in color, using perforated clear plastic bags by gently pulling the bag over the plant to the base where it can then be tied off using a 4-in. twist-tie. Secure the plants around the stake using 7-in. twist-ties (6 plants per stake).",
    "Staking will keep plants erect and allow for better airflow as plants mature (Figs. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0011] and 12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0012]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6099bcdc-419f-43a3-9193-31dcdc36bad9/cpz1127-fig-0011-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 11\nGrowth of transgenic plants in soil.

(A) Bagging of the inflorescence. Yellow arrow represents the location ideal to tie the bag to minimize the loss of seeds and health of the plants. (B) Close-up of inflorescence: representative example of the stage of inflorescence before stopping the irrigation and starting the plant dry-out process.\n9. Continue monitoring plants for signs of fungus, pests, and condensation near the panicle and address those accordingly.\nIf condensation is observed inside bags, reduce watering frequency, as this can lead to fungus or other plant health issues causing poor seed development or premature plant death and consequent loss of transgenic lines).\n10. Once approximately 50% of the seeds on the panicle have matured and turned darker in color, stop watering to allow plants to completely dry down prior to harvest (Fig. 12[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0012]).\n11. Harvest seeds from a single plant at a time by cutting off the base of the plant at the soil level using a pair of scissors while keeping the 4-in. twist tie in place to prevent the loss of any seed that has already shattered from the dry inflorescence (Fig. 13A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0013] and 13B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0013]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ead8774d-00fa-4b90-b9a1-edbe78b7af43/cpz1127-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13\nSeed drying and harvest.

Invert the bag containing the plant so that all seed will fall toward the “top” of the bag, and tap the panicles to dislodge the remaining mature seed.",
    "13. Using scissors, snip off a corner of the bag and transfer seeds into a clean weighing boat.\n14. Clean the seeds from any plant debris and transfer clean seeds into small coin envelope (Fig. 13C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-fig-0013]). Label the packet and store at 4°C.\nMolecular analysis of putative transgenic events can be performed using the DNA isolated from the tissues samples collected from tissue culture materials or greenhouse grown plants following the standard PCR or TAQMAN® assay described by Van Eck, Swartwood, Pidgeon, and Maxson-Stein (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.127#cpz1127-bib-0020]).",
