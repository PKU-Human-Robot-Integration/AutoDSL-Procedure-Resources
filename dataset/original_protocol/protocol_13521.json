    "This study was approved by the human ethics committee of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital (approval number 2020-50-k28).\n1. Preparation and sterilization of the force sensor\nUse abrasion-resistant adhesive tape to fix the force sensor on the upper surface of the tibial trial before sterilization.\nPack and sterilize the force sensor using low-temperature sterilization with hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The sensor should be fixed on the tibial trial to prevent the effect of the shear force.\n2. Procedure of mobile-bearing UKA\nPerform the operation procedure of mobile-bearing UKA according to the standard surgical instruction6 or the kinematic alignment technique introduced by Zhang et al.10.\nStop the procedure when all the bone cuttings are finished, and the gap balance is confirmed manually.\n3. Installation of the force sensor\nInstall the force sensor along with the tibial trail first, and then install the femoral component.\nEnsure the sensor, the USB line, and the laptop are connected properly. After that, insert the feeler gauge into the component gap, and place the knee joint at deep flexion of 120° as the start point of the measurement. (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Use a sterilized protractor to make sure the accuracy of the knee flexion angle.\n4. Measurement and recording of raw data of the contact force\nRecord raw data of the force value using a computer program developed for this sensor.\nFirst, pay attention to the right side of the operation interface (Figure 3), and set up the recording frequency at 10 Hz and the recording time at 5 s. Then, click on the Data Feedback button when the knee is placed at the flexion angle of 120°.",
    "When the recording process is over, click on the Data Feedback button again when the knee flexion is 90°, then 60°, 45°, 20°, and 0° (Figure 3).\n\t​NOTE: Raw data is saved into .txt files by the computer program, and further management is needed to acquire force value.\n5. Management of raw data\nInput the .txt file into a spreadsheet (digital table) for raw data conversion. Compute the average value of 50 records as the contact force.\n\t​NOTE: The program can also show the distribution of the contact force.\n6. Clinical and radiographic observations\nRecord the patient's demographic data such as age, gender, diagnosis, and the American Knee Society score (AKSS).\nTake radiographs of anteroposterior, lateral, and full-length weight-bearing lower limb preoperatively and within 1 week postoperatively.\nMeasure the varus/valgus alignment of the femoral and tibial prosthesis (Figure 4-1), the flexion/extension alignment of the femoral prosthesis, and the tibial posterior slope (Figure 4-2).\nMeasure the hip-knee-ankle angle on the full-length lower limb radiographs both preoperatively and postoperatively. Measure the continuity of the prosthesis (Figure 4-3) and the convergence/divergence angle, which implies the axis of the femoral prosthesis relative to the surface of the tibial prosthesis (Figure 4-4).\nMake sure these data are integrated and can be analyzed in the future.\n\tNOTE: The method of the radiographic measurement of the angles6,11 are shown in Figure 4.\nSubscription Required.
