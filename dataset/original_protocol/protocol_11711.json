    "All of the experiments were approved by the York Ethics board and all participants signed informed consent forms. The experiments were performed in accordance with the Treaty of Helsinki.\n1. Stimuli\nTactile Detection Stimulus\n\t\nUse a tactor (1.17\" diameter and 0.30\" thick) to deliver tactile stimuli of 250 Hz vibration for 100 msec. Using a purpose-built tactor provides a linear relationship between the amount of travel and the voltage applied.\nControl tactile stimulus delivery with a 64 bit sound card.\n\t\t\nTo drive the tactor, treat it as a loudspeaker. Connect a stereo audio amplifier to a 64-bit computer stereo sound card. Connect the tactor to one of the outputs of the amplifier (e.g., the 'left speaker out'). Connect the second channel (e.g., the 'right speaker out') of the amplifier to a regular loudspeaker to provide auditory signals to the participant.\nIn the computer code that is controlling the experiment, generate the waveform that will be used to vibrate the tactor (e.g., a 250 Hz sinewave of duration 100 msec), and another waveform for the auditory signal (e.g., a 3,000 Hz sinewave with a duration of 100 msec). See Example Code 1 in the Supplemental Code File.\nPut each of these two waveforms into a two-dimensional array. For the tactor array put the signal in the first dimension and set the second dimension to all zeros. For the sound array put the signal in the second dimension and set the first to all zeros. Play the appropriate array to the soundcard at the appropriate point in the program. See Example Code 1 in the Supplemental Code File for a demonstration of how this is done.\nAttach the tactor to a strap with a mechanical-based fastening product.\nMasking Stimulus",
    "Provide the masking stimulus by an electric, hand-held vibrator (4 cm diameter; 83 Hz when set on \"low\").\nBased on the areas where masking is to be tested, select the sites where the masking stimulus is to be applied.\n2. Experimental Setup and Design\nArrange the computer and equipment on a desk, with a chair in front of it, for the experimenter.\nSet up a table on which participants rest their left (test) arm. Place a chair to the right side of the table. Put an armrest stand next to the chair on which the participants rest their right (masking arm) elbow. Add cushioning to the table and armrest for comfort.\nArrange a loudspeaker on a mechanically isolated surface. Arrange foot pedals (connected to the left and right buttons of a computer mouse) so that the participant's feet will rest comfortably on them (Figure 1).\nChoose the parameters of the study, including the appropriate number of trials required to obtain a reliable estimate of the threshold (typically, between 40-50 trials) and the number of blocks into which the experiment is to be divided (e.g., two blocks of 20-25 trials per condition).\nMake a list of the order in which the conditions will be run. Use this list to determine where to hold the masking stimulus for each block.\nEnter the number of trials directly into the computer program code (e.g., ntrials = 25; See Supplemental Code File). Ensure that each block is no longer than 10 min to maintain attention.\nProgram a two-alternative-forced-choice tactile detection task11in which stimulus intensity is controlled with a Bayesian adaptive psychophysical staircase psychometric procedure12.",
    "For each trial, present two 1 sec intervals, marked by three beeps (5 kHz, 3 kHz and 5 kHz, duration 100 msec), with the tactile stimulus presented in the middle of one of the intervals. Have the participant indicate in which interval the stimulus was presented by means of foot pedals (left for first, right for second). See Example Code 2, which shows how the intervals are run and scored.\n\t\tNote: The computer scores the response as \"correct\" or \"wrong\" and the adaptive staircase chooses the next value to be presented accordingly.\n\t\tNote: This method determines a threshold value for detecting the vibration at the test site.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53733/53733fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Experimental Design. This figure shows the set up of the experiment and the materials used. See text for details.\n3. Experimental Procedure\nObtain written informed consent. Seat the participant in the chair with their feet resting comfortably on the response foot pedals and explain the experimental procedure.\nMeasure and record the length of the dorsal surface of the left forearm. Apply the strap so the tactor is positioned in the middle of the arm halfway between the inner angle of the elbow and the wrist crease.\nWrap a tensor bandage loosely around the arm several times to hold the tactor in place.\nInstruct participants to place their left arm on the table and rest their right elbow on the armrest. Blindfold the participant to prevent them looking at the stimulus or masking location and instruct them to look straight ahead throughout the experiment.\nStart with a block of 20 practice trials (without the masking stimulus) in order to familiarize participants with the tactile detection task and to allow them to become familiar with the tactile stimuli.",
    "Following the practice trials, begin the experiment, running the blocks of conditions in a random, counterbalanced order. Before beginning each block, ensure that the arms and the masking stimulus are in the correct positions.\n\t\nFor each condition, hold the masking stimulus on the chosen site, referring to the list of conditions made earlier. Cross off each condition as it is run. Hold the masking stimulus throughout each block of data collection trials maintaining approximately constant pressure. The masking stimulus can be applied through thin clothing.\nRun the experimental program which will run through a set number of trials as previously selected. Introduce a 2 min rest period after each short block of trials. After a given block of trials is completed, select the next site for the masking stimulus and run the program again. Repeat until all trials are completed.\n4. Data Analysis\nTo visualize and confirm the estimate of the threshold value returned by the adaptive staircase program12, fit the participants' data with a cumulative Gaussian The formula for a cumulative Gaussian (sigmoid) that goes from 50% (chance level - equal number of 0s - wrong and 1's- correct) to 100% (all 1's, all correct) is:\n\tprobability of a correct response = 0.5 + 0.5/(1+exp(-(x-x0)/std))\n\twhere x is the intensity value tested, x0 is the 75% threshold value, and std is the standard deviation of the estimate. This formula can be fitted to the data using any curve-fitting software and the resulting x0 value compared to the adaptive staircase value.\n\t\nEnsure that the curve goes between 50% (chance performance) and 100%. Conduct statistical analyses (e.g., t-tests or ANOVAs) on the 75% threshold values obtained under each condition of the experiment (e.g., between different masking sites) to determine if there are any differences between the conditions tested.",
    "In order to identify outliers, calculate the mean and the standard deviation for a given condition. Compare each participant's score with the mean and if an individual score is more than 2 standard deviation from that mean then regard this score as an outlier and remove it from the analysis. Alternative criteria may be used if desired.\nTo standardize the values of the intensity of the tactors (which are in in arbitrary units), convert them to decibels relative to the control thresholds (measured when the masking stimulus is applied to the control site, e.g., the shoulder). Use this formula:\n\tdB = 10 x log10 (threshold value/control threshold value).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
