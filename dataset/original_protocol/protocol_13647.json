    "Ethics Statement:\nThis study was approved by the local ethics committee (69/2017) and was conducted in compliance with the declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Collection and transport of respiratory epithelial cells\nBrushing\n\t\nBefore brushing, administer a two-week course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid to the patient to eradicate biofilms interfering with cilia function. Ensure the antibiotic is terminated 2 days before the procedure.\nTo diminish an overlay of mucous material on the brushed epithelial cell strips, ask the patient to blow their nose thoroughly. Ask parents to help their small children blow their noses.\nFor brushing, use an interdental brush of 0.6 mm size (see the Table of Materials). Keep the head of the patient fixed with one hand, and with the other hand, brush the inferior turbinate of both nostrils to collect sufficient epithelial cell strips.\n\t\tNOTE: A slight resistance is usually experienced when inserting the interdental brush deeply under the inferior turbinate. Nasal brushing is carried out by quick turning and picking for approximately 2 s. Longer and intense brushing might otherwise cause severe epithelial injury and consecutive epistaxis.\nIf bronchoscopy is planned for reasons other than suspected PCD, collect samples during bronchoscopy by brushing the carina or bronchial epithelium or by biopsy13.\nDrop the harvested cell strips into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing the cell-nourishing Dulbecco´s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM).\n\t\tNOTE: Epithelial cell strips usually drop off the brush more easily by tossing and turning the brush against the tube wall.\nClose the lid of the microcentrifuge tube and hold the tube against a light source. Shake the tube to discover harvested cell strips and conglomerates.\nTransport of the specimen",
    "Place the microcentrifuge tubes in a tightly closed polystyrene box and ensure that the lid of the tubes is properly closed and the tubes are fixed inside the box.\nAdd a cold pack; however, avoid freezing the specimen.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal temperature for preserving the specimen before investigation is approximately 4-8 °C (39.2-46.4 °F).\nEnsure that the preserved samples are analyzed during the next 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: In these experiments, the mean time between brushings and HSVMA was 3 h.\n2. High-speed video microscopy analysis (HSVMA)\nVideo microscopy of the samples\n\t\nAfter receiving the microcentrifuge tubes containing the samples, warm them up to 37 °C (98.6 °F) to mimic an optimal, in vivo-like environment.\nIf the microscope is equipped with a heating unit, place the tubes under the hood and warm them up there. Alternatively, use an incubator to warm up the samples.\nStart the camera and the software of the video unit on the PC.\nUsing a pipette, take a small amount of the sample and place two drops into a cuvette or glass-bottom dish (see the Table of Materials). Cover the cuvette or dish with a lid and place it under the microscope.\nFor evaluation of the samples, use a differential-interference microscope equipped with a cold-light source and a video camera able to record at high speed (at least 200 frames/s). Use an oil immersion lens with a 100x magnification and put a drop of immersion oil onto the surface of the optic.\n\t\tNOTE: Microscopes with a lens approaching from below are recommended.",
    "Approach the bottom of the dish with the microscope lens and search for cell clusters without red blood cells and with low mucus content. After finding a representative region of interest (ROI), focus on one specific group of beating cilia with the largest cilia movements and record a video sequence. Record cells with beating cilia sidewise and from above. After that, search for another representative cluster of cells and repeat the recording.\n\t\tNOTE: The cilia coated cells must be investigated under a 1,000x magnification, and beating cilia should be recorded with a digital high-speed video (DHSV) camera set on a frame rate of 200/s or more (256/s in this protocol). Because the data obtained from the recorded video clips requires a lot of space on the hard drive, an external SSD hard drive is recommended.\nAnalysis of video sequences\n\t\nTo determine CBF and CBP, play the video clips back frame by frame.\nTo determine CBF, set the frame rate into slow motion with 15 frames/s and count 10 consecutive beats.\nRecord the number of frames passing by during a single cycle of 10 beats and insert the result into Eq (1). Determine the frequency by calculating the mean of all recorded cilia beat cycles and compare the result with the reference values for age (see Table 1)14.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63292/63292eq01.jpg (1)\n\t\tWhere X is the number of frames passing by during a cycle of 10 beats.\nFor evaluating CBP, watch if the movement of the beating cilia is in full range (see Figure 1) and synchronized. Have two independent operators evaluate the CBP to prevent selection bias.\nReport the results of the HSVMA analysis to be either compatible, unlikely, or inconclusive with PCD.\nSubscription Required.
