    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of calibration samples\nTiming: 30 min\nTo guarantee a high quality of the data collected on the microscope, a calibration routine is usually performed on the X-ray microscope, typically after shutdown of the synchrotron, that is twice per year. Calibration protocols allow for reproducible measurements of the effective pixel size and X-ray linear absorption coefficient, also called LAC (which is at the basis for segmentation and analysis of the reconstructed data). The calibration process uses polystyrene microbeads of different sizes. Depending on spatial resolution in the X-ray microscope and the size of a specimen, we use beads of 6 μm, 8 μm, and 10 μm with a size variation of less than 1% and with a chemical composition that meets ultra-high purity standards (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nTo ensure full penetration of X-rays, choose beads of <8 μm in size.\nSpin microbeads at 10000×g for 2 min using a centrifuge. Remove supernatant and resuspend beads in PBS 1×.\nRepeat washing in PBS 1× twice.\nCalibration standards were generated by filling a specimen capillary with a suspension of polystyrene beads (as delivered by the manufacturer).\nLoad 1.1–3.0 μL of beads mixture into a glass capillary using a micro-loading tip.\nRepeat steps 5 until a few capillaries containing beads are prepared.\nProceed with cryofixation.\nOptional: If specimens are prepared with addition of calibration beads, the calibration step can be performed on capillaries containing both – beads and cells.\nSpecimen loading\nTiming: 5 to 10 min",
    "This step shows how to load cells in glass capillaries and prepare the samples for rapid plunge-freezing. The addition of beads to cells serves two purposes: 1 – beads have greater mass and thus “shield” cells from propagation of pressure during plunge-freezing and reduce deformation of cells; 2 – they serve as calibration samples to calculate the effective pixel size.\nPrepare trimmed capillaries with a tip size suiting the cell diameter as described in Glass capillary preparation.\nCount cell density using hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\nChoose beads of the same size as capillary tip and calculate volume to ensure 1:1 ratio of cells and beads. For example, 15mL of 8μm beads with concentration of solids 0.3%, contains about 4.5 million beads per mL.\nSpin microbeads at 10000×g for 2 min using a centrifuge. Remove supernatant and resuspend beads in PBS 1×.\nRepeat washing in PBS 1× twice.\nNote: The bead washing is to guarantee that the beads will not affect physiological state of cells.\nSpin cells in a 15-mL tube at 300×g for 10 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1.5mL tube together with microbeads.\nSpin mix of microbeads and cells at 300×g for 10 min. Remove supernatant, resuspend beads/cells mixture in 20–30 μL PBS 1× and mix it by tapping with your index finger.\nLoad 1.1–3.0 μL of beads/cells mixture into a glass capillary using a micro-loading tip.",
    "Note: Cells and beads go into the glass tip due to capillary forces, thus it is recommended to wait a few seconds before removing micro-loading tip from the glass tube. Check the quality of the prepared capillary under a light microscope (see (Smith et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]) for example of equally distributed cells in a tip). Capillaries with low number of cells or lower ratio of cells and beads are usually discarded.\nRepeat step 15 until the desired number of capillaries containing specimens is prepared.\nOptional: It is helpful to document approximate number of cells and beads in each capillary visible under a light microscope.\nCryofixation\nTiming: 1 to 2 h\nAll specimens, whether live or chemically fixed, must be frozen prior to X-ray imaging to prevent radiation damage. Cryo-fixation can be performed with high-pressure freezer or plunge-freezer. Both techniques are optimized to prevent ice crystal formation and preserve cellular ultrastructure. This step describes rapid plunge-freezing of cells in liquid propane with the in-house developed automatic plunge freezer.\nPut a puck and storage box in the freezing apparatus (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) and cool down the freezing machine by liquid nitrogen.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1433-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Components for the cryofixation of capillaries\n(A) Empty puck and a storage box inside the freezing apparatus before addition of liquid nitrogen.\n(B) Top: Puck filled with capillaries (blue) and pins (orange) for fixed orientation of a puck in a storage box filled with liquid nitrogen. Bottom: Propane well (at 20°C–24°C temperature) in which the capillary is plunged positioned on the propane heater to avoid overcooling of propane.\n(C) The grabber firmly holding a capillary before plunging down.",
    "Optional: Due to symmetry of a puck, it is helpful to insert colored plastic pins in a few capillary slots (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B) to fix the orientation of the puck and retrieve capillary of interest.\nHome the robot, fill and put the propane well in position for plunging and attach tubes for dry nitrogen.\nCritical: Purging with dry nitrogen “cleanse” the system from contaminants, preventing buildup of ice on glass capillaries.\nSet up the plunger according to the type of samples to freeze down to allow proper vitrification of the sample. Make sure the height of the propane well is set correctly.\nTo create a temperature gradient for the plunging, set up the heater for dry nitrogen at 30°C. Set up heater for the viewing glass window at 30°C to protect from ice buildup and ensure visibility of capillaries (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nMount the capillary on the grabber (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Plunge the capillary in the propane well and automatically transfer the capillary from the propane well to an empty position in the storage puck.\nCritical: While simultaneous cooling down and heating of the freezer seems to be counterproductive, it ensures stabilization of temperature and temperature gradient for vitrification at the specific settings, including stability of the freezing apparatus over long periods of time (6–8 h).\nPause point: Vitrified samples can be stored in liquid nitrogen for weeks before data collection.\nCritical: Take cryogen safety courses and use appropriate personal protective equipment.\nX-ray beam alignment and the microscope setup\nTiming: 30–45 min",
    "The transmission soft X-ray microscope (XM-2) is located at the beamline 2.1 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The description of the beamline, its optical components, microscope design and cooling system was described elsewhere (Le Gros et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). This step describes alignment of illumination optics and imaging objective to achieve maximum illumination flux.\nCritical: Take beamline safety and operation course and use appropriate personal protective equipment.\nCheck the beam status of the ALS (https://als.lbl.gov/beam-status/[href=https://als.lbl.gov/beam-status/]). If the beam is available for user operation, open the Branchline Equipment Protective System (EPS) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and reset the pressure on the system.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1433-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Main components of the XM-2 microscope\n(A) Schematic overview of the Branchline EPS (Equipment Protective System) showing all valves (orange), gauges (blue), optical components and the path taken by the X-rays along the beamline and into the experimental end-station (outlined in purple).\n(B) Photograph of the experimental end-station. The optical table is 5m long and accommodates KZP, MZP boxes, sample chamber, X-ray camera, cryo-transfer device and controllers for stages, temperature and gas flow (N and He).\nCritical: Make sure that the status of all beamline components is correct (green). If not please contact the beamline scientist.\nEnsure that the pressure of the pressure gauge IG207 is around 10−5 Torr, IG206 is around 10−7 Torr, IG205 is around 10−8 Torr, IG204 and IG203 are around 10−10 Torr (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: The electronic logbook activated by the user at the beginning of the measurement asks to document these values. If out of range the logbook will give warning by depicting values in red, thus ensuring safe handling of the microscope.",
    "Open the vacuum valves from right to the left, that is first VVR204 , followed byVVR203 and VVR202 to let the X-ray beam come through into the microscope. The black line turns purple showing the path of the X-ray beam in the microscope.\nNote: Once the X-ray beam is open, the pressure on the gauges IG203 and IG204 will drop to 10−9 Torr.\nOpen the GUI and turn on the microscope. The GUI of the microscope turns on thermocouples, mechanical stages, their controllers for the condenser zone plate (KZP), micro-zone plate (MZP), and the X-ray camera (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nFill the liquid nitrogen cold traps of the KZP and MZP box.\nAlign the microscope:\nHome the sample stage, the filters, and the camera of the microscope.\nMove the X-ray camera towards the sample stage to get a big field-of-view and to see the intactness of the silicon nitrate window (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nNote: To enable a quick alignment of the beam, a 2×2 binning (512×512 pixels) combined with 100% filter transmission in non-scanning mode is used.\nAlign the microscope at ambient (20°C–24°C) temperature by translating the MZP and the KZP to the center of the FOV. After several displacements, the X-ray beam will look like on Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nNote: With regular use of the microscope, adjustment of the pinhole is not required.\nCool down the sample stage and re-align the beam\nInitialize the nitrogen and helium flow.\nTo cool down helium, fill the zeolite tank with liquid nitrogen.\nNote: Helium flow purges away humid air in the sample chamber.\nStart cooling down the cryobox with liquid nitrogen and turn on the heaters on top of the cryobox to avoid ice accumulation in the sample chamber.",
    "Re-align the microscope after cooling down as described in Step 27 The result of this alignment should look like Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B.\nAfter alignment, drive the camera back to its initial position and check the homogeneity of the illumination by making a snapshot with the scanning mode (pattern generator, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). If not, re-adjust the MZP and, possibly, the KZP. The scanning image should look similar to the one in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D.\nNote: The pattern generator allows to scan the X-ray beam in a zig zag like pattern (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). It is defined by the amplitude in X and Y directions, the exposure time (time to make the scan), the number of steps and samples. These last two parameters are rarely modified. Here the result is displayed with a 100 ms exposure time and pattern of 18 x18 μm with helium flow. The exposure time is adjusted to not saturate the camera.\nOptional: To ensure “water window” regime, the operating energy of the microscope can be calibrated using the K-shell absorption edges of oxygen (543 eV) and nitrogen (410 eV), by translating KZP and MZP along the x-ray beam path effectively scanning over whole spectral energy range. Position with highest X-ray transmission corresponds to ideal microscope settings just below oxygen absorption edge is identified.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1433-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Alignment of the X-ray beam to ensure maximum intensity and homogeneous illumination of the FOV\n(A) Low magnification (ca. 2150×) X-ray image after alignment of MZP, KZP and a pinhole at ambient (20°C–24°C) temperature.\n(B) X-ray image after MZP and KZP alignment after cooling down in high (ca. 3100×) magnification.",

(D) Pattern generator shows a line scanned pattern defined by the amplitude in X and in Y, the exposure time of the image (time to make the scan), the number of steps and samples.\nTransferring the specimen in the microscope\nTiming: 1 to 3 min\nThe loaded capillaries are stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection. This step describes transfer of the capillary in the sample chamber of the SXT microscope using a custom-made cryo-transfer device.\nInitiate the specimen transfer procedure in the GUI of the microscope. The sample stage will automatically move away from the chamber where the capillary is positioned, providing room for the cryo-transfer device. A little column of cold helium can be observed coming out of the sample chamber.\nNote: As for most tomography systems, the sample stage is equipped with several motors, specifically translational axes X, Y, Z, two inclination stages for rotation in planes XY and XZ, and the rotation around the Y-axis. These set of motors allows positioning of the specimen in the center of rotation and positioning of the rotation axis in the center of the X-ray camera.\nAdd the sample to the database (name of the principal investigator, cell type and cell condition).\nNote: The capillary ID will be generated and assigned to all datasets automatically.\nMaximize the cold helium flow of the cryo-transfer device in order to keep the sample vitrified and transfer the capillary to the sample chamber.\nNote: The specimen is suspended in the sample chamber by clamps.\nGrab the capillary by translating the sample stage in Y and Z axis (X is typically not required) and attaching capillary to a goniometer by a pin (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1433-Fig5.jpg",

Transfer and alignment of the capillary in the X-ray microscope\n(A) Microscopy image of the goniometer and attached (by pin) to its capillary.\n(B) Sparse alignment of a capillary tip to the center of the FOV (green circle) using a Borescope.\n(C) X-ray image of the capillary with cell when performing fine alignment under X-rays.\nPress sample transfer complete, which will automatically release the clamps and send the sample in the sample chamber for alignment with a Borescope.\nCritical: To avoid thawing of the capillary and buildup of the ice it is important to be quick.\nAlign the capillary tip in the center of X-ray beam under Borescope (low magnification) which is fiducially aligned with the optical path of the X-ray microscope (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nSelect alignment done.\nNote: The capillary will be transferred down into the X-ray beam path.\nOptional: If ice buildup on the capillary surface is observed under the microscope, de-ice the capillary (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). The de-ice function of the microscope will increase the cryobox temperature to -90°C for 60 seconds and then cool down the microscope to −150°C.\nFind the tip of the capillary under the X-rays and align the capillary with higher resolution until the capillary is in the center of the FOV (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nBy translating capillary vertically, find the cell within the FOV. Check rotation center again. If not centered, repeat step 37.\nNote: To avoid multiple exposure of a cell and thus high X-ray dose, we recommend to perform fine alignment of the capillary rotation below the cell of interest.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1433-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

On the right modules for control of capillary positioning in X, Y and Z (in blue), rotation of capillary tip to align capillary in the FOV (orange), settings for tomography acquisition (purple), automatic correction of capillary to the center of the FOV (dashed circle), selection of MZP (dashed rectangular) and others (image histogram, beam alignment, de-ice, etc.).\nTomographic data acquisition\nTiming: up to 10 min\nThe tomographic data acquisition module ensures automatic control of the capillary position within FOV.\nSet data acquisition parameters to 2 × 2 binning, 2° per step and 92 projections, corresponding to 180° data acquisition (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nOptional: For sensitive cells we recommend to distribute X-ray radiation dose more evenly (Loconte et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and acquire tomogram over 360° by setting step size to 4°.\nSet the exposure time between 200 ms and 500 ms, depending on the sample thickness and the beam flux (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nMove the sample out of the X-ray beam and select X-ray absorption filter (67%, 23%, and 4%) for reference (also called flat field) images to not saturate the X-ray camera.\nMove the sample back to the center of the FOV.\nSwitch on auto-correction procedure that, if capillary shifts out of the FOV, will automatically bring it back to the center of the FOV (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nStart the data acquisition.\nNote: Two sets of 10 flat-field images are collected automatically before and after the acquisition of projection images of the specimen.",
    "Optional: If a cell is larger than the field of view horizontally, shift the X-ray camera closer to the capillary. Changing the specimen-camera distance will reduce pixel size and increase field of view. If a cell is larger than the field of view vertically, shift specimen vertically by 80% of the field of view (20% overlapping area for stitching of 3D datasets) and repeat tomography acquisition.\nFind the next cell in the capillary and repeat tomographic data acquisition, i.e., step 39–44.\nCritical: The microscope has switchable resolution, that is two MZPs with 60 nm and 30 nm outermost zone width (Weinhardt et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). Make sure to select the MZP in use (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]), the pixel size and thus step size for translational movement of all motors will be recalculated automatically.\nRemoving specimen from the microscope\nWhen all cells in the capillary are imaged, move capillary up (Y axis) and remove the capillary from sample stage.\nCritical: Immediately dispose the capillary in a sharp container.\nTransfer the next specimen in the microscope, repeat alignment and tomography acquisition step 30–44.\nNote: In a typical working time of 8 h about 40 samples can be imaged.\nShutting down the microscope\nWhen all specimens are imaged, the microscope can be shut down and slowly brought to ambient (20°C–24°C) temperature.\nReduce the flow of dry nitrogen.\nSet de-ice of the microscope to 40°C for 360 s. Repeat de-ice procedure until liquid nitrogen in sample chamber has evaporated.\nClose the nitrogen and helium flow.\nSet the heaters on the sample box to continue heating to 24°C for 6 h after shutting down.\nNote: The heaters will continue to warm up the microscope after shutting down to ensure slow transition to ambient (20°C–24°C) temperature and avoiding buildup of ice on the microscope.\nTomographic data reconstruction",
    "Timing: 5 min\nAfter the data acquisition, the tomographic data reconstruction will be performed automatically (Parkinson et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Given the data collection was successful there are no manual steps involved. The reconstruction is available within approximately 5 min of the acquisition in its corresponding data folder.\nPause point: The reconstructed dataset can be stored at the national center for X-ray tomography server (with an automatic backup) until further analysis.\nCalibration of the microscope\nTo enable quantitative analysis of the SXT data, the microscope magnification and LAC values are calibrated with beads.\nTo calibrate the effective pixel size (pixel size of the camera changed by the microscope magnification) open SXT dataset with for example Fiji (Schneider et al. 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]) of polystyrene beads with known size.\nTake measurements of bead size in pixels. Calculate the effective pixel size.\nIf necessary, repeat step 53 for different X-ray camera positions, along the beam.\nNote: The XM-2 specimen stage contains a photolithographic, interpolated graticule that provides 1% positional accuracy over a 10 μm range. Consequently, the microscope magnification is measured with very high confidence. Therefore, the effective pixel size for different magnifications is measured and calculated once per year and can be used for any SXT dataset acquired with the same zone plate.\nTo calibrate LAC values, open tomographic data of beads collected under the same conditions as cells.\nUsing thresholding (see segmentation and data analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.11]) segment 80–100 polystyrene beads with a 6 μm of diameter. Multiply X-ray absorption (intensity) by the pixel area, i.e., 1/(2·pixel size) in μm.\nCompare the X-ray LAC of the beads with expected 0.81 ± 0.03 μm−1.",
    "Optional: In the case of mismatch, it is possible to estimate the X-ray energy window used with SXT imaging by comparing experimental LAC with expected absorption for polystyrene (C8H8) from the atomic scattering database maintained by the Center for X-Ray Optics (CXRO) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (http://cxro.lbl.gov/x-ray-data-booklet[href=http://cxro.lbl.gov/x-ray-data-booklet]).\nNote: After calibration steps, each voxel in the 3D reconstruction of the cell has an associated X-ray LAC value. The voxel LAC value directly correlates with the concentration of molecules in the corresponding space in the specimen.\nSegmentation and data analysis\nTiming: from 1 to 24 h per dataset\nTo analyze and quantify volume and mutual distances of cellular organelles, the procedure of isolating individual components, known as segmentation, is performed on reconstructed data. Currently segmentation of soft x-ray tomography datasets, particularly for samples of unknown variability like virally infected cells, is performed manually. Reconstructed tomograms are saved in .mrc format and are segmented and analyzed, using the commercial software Amira-Avizo (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described here.\nOptional: Segmentation of SXT datasets can be performed with other segmentation editors, for example in Fiji (Schneider et al. 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), MITK (Nolden et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), Slicer3D (Fedorov et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) or others.\nOpen tomographic data (.mrc file).\nNormalize the LAC value of each pixel as described in step 56. The normalization allows interpreting x-ray absorption per μm (not per pixel as reconstructed) assuring accurate measurements of both organelle chemical composition and volume.\nOptional: Perform edge-preserving smoothing to simplify outlining of organelles and to smooth visualization of the SXT data.",
    "Go to segmentation editor and define a set of materials (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]), that is nucleus (if desired heterochromatin and euchromatin), mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cytosol and lipid droplets. For infected cells, we recommend adding unknown materials for organelles associated with virus, like double membrane vesicles. These unknown organelles can be identified later.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1433-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

On the right: virtual slice through the reconstructed SXT volume with manually segmented nucleus (blue) and based on the absorption threshold (0.28 - 0.45 μm-1) semi-automatically segmented mitochondria (red). The insert shows expected outcome of segmentation procedure, i.e., 3D rendering of the cell, showing heterochromatin (blue) and euchromatin (magenta) defining the nucleus, mitochondria (magenta), lipid droplets (yellow), ER (cyan), and plasma membrane (grey).\nAdjust the contrast to enhance the edge of the structure of interest (i.e., nucleus, nucleolus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum - ER, intracellular vesicles, plasma membrane).\nSegment cytosol using magic wand tool (see Tools Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7])\nselect “same material only” and “all slices”.\nadjust the range of LAC values until all parts of the cells are selected and add to material (cytosol).\nSegment a nucleus\nUsing the tool Brush outline the edge of the nucleus, fill outlined region (by pressing F) and add to the nucleus material.\nRepeat outlining of the nucleus for every tenth orthoslices.\nSelect all slices and interpolate the labels (Selection - interpolate)\nIf desired heterochromatin and euchromatin can be segmented semi-automatically based on their bimodal distribution by thresholding (nucleus volume only).\nSegment mitochondria, ER, lipid droplets, and intracellular vesicles semi-automatically\nSelect Magic Wand tool",
    "Define threshold for X-ray absorption threshold for the analyzed organelle. From previous studies (McDermott et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Loconte et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), for lipid droplets 0.75 ± 0.09 μm−1, mitochondria 0.45 ± 0.03 μm−1, ER 0.24 ± 0.04 μm−1.\nSelect voxel corresponding to the organelle.\nAdd it to the material.\nRepeat until all organelles are segmented.\nNote: LAC values have relatively small variability, depending on the size and biological features of the analyzed cell type.\nOptional: Tomographic data collection is conducted in thin-walled glass capillaries, which show an average X-ray absorption of 0.70 μm−1. When the selection of a certain organelle does not omit the selection of the capillary, the capillary can be removed by extracting its internal content. The procedure is performed in Amira using the “Volume Edit” option.\nRetrieve physical features and values of each set of organelles by selecting Menu bar, Segmentation and Material Statistics (Mode: materials).\nNote: The immediate output of the segmentation provides information about either the cumulative or the individual volume (in pixels), surface area, and the average X-ray absorption of individual label fields. In general each label field can be exported and used as an input in custom-made analysis pipelines."
