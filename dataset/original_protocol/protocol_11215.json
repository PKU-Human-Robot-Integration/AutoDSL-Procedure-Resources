    "Animal use followed University Laboratory Animal Resources (ULAR) regulations under the OSU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)–approved protocol 2007A0120-R4 (PI: Dr. Gina Sizemore).\n1. Tail-vein injection of breast cancer cells\nPreparation of cells and syringe for injection\n\t\nPlate an appropriate number of cells based on the number of mice and cell concentration to be used.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of cells injected and time to the development of metastases will depend on the cell line used and will need to be optimized. In this demonstration, 1 x 106 MDA-MB-231 cells are injected intravenously into NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice, and macroscopic lung lesions are observed no later than 24 days post-injection. For the MVT1 murine mammary tumor cell line17, 3 x 106 cells are injected into immune-competent FVB/N mice with numerous lung metastases observed by 14 days22,23.\nAspirate media and rinse cell plates with 1x PBS. Trypsinize cells in minimal volume, add appropriate volume of media, and count cells using a hematocytometer or another preferred method. Trypan blue (0.4%) or other live/dead cell dyes can be used to determine viable cell counts.\nPellet cells by spinning at 180 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend appropriate number of cells in sterile 1x PBS such that a volume of 100 µL is injected per mouse. Keep cell suspension on ice to maintain viability.\nPrior to injection, thoroughly resuspend cells with a 200 µL or 1 mL pipette to avoid clumping. Draw up 100 µL in a 28 G insulin syringe (see Table of Materials).\nEliminate any air bubbles by keeping the syringe vertical, tapping on the syringe, and slowly adjusting the plunger. Injection of air bubbles into the vein is likely to cause an air/gas embolism that can be fatal.\nLateral tail-vein injection",
    "NOTE: For experimental breast cancer metastasis assays, injections are performed on > 6 weeks old female mice.\n\t\nHandle the mouse by the tail and slide animal into a slotted tube/restraint device of an appropriate size (see the Table of Materials for restraint device used).\nInsert the plug portion of the restraint device and position the mouse on its side such that its lateral tail vein is easy to view. The mouse has a ventral artery in line with the genitalia, a dorsal vein, and two lateral caudal veins.\nClean the surface of the mouse’s tail with an aseptic wipe. Grasp the tail between index finger and thumb with non-dominant hand and apply slight tension.\nBeginning at the distal portion of the tail, insert the needle parallel to the vein with the bevel end up.\nIf allowed, carefully recap the needle and bend to a 20-30° angle. A single-handed approach or needle recapping device is highly recommended.\n\t\tNOTE: It is not necessary to aspirate as this may cause the vein to collapse. However, a small flash of blood may be seen when first placed. The needle will advance smoothly into the vein with proper placement.\nSlowly dispense the complete volume into the vein. There should not be resistance when the plunger is pushed.\nIf any resistance is felt, promptly remove the syringe needle. If needed, re-insert the needle (ideally no more than 3 attempts) moving toward the proximal end of the tail or opposing lateral vein.\nA small volume of blood will likely be displaced after injection. Apply gentle pressure with sterile gauze and wipe with aseptic wipe.\nPromptly dispose of syringe in appropriate sharps container.\nReturn the mouse to a clean, ventilated cage and monitor for signs of distress.",
    "Monitor mice 2-3x/weekly for signs of metastasis formation (labored breathing, hunched posture, weight loss) and general distress. The time to development of metastasis will depend on cell line and mouse strain.\nIf using an in vivo live animal imaging device, image mice immediately after tail-vein injection to confirm successful injection of cells and obtain time “zero” data (specific details on in vivo bioluminescence imaging are not included herein, but are described by Yang et al.24).\n2. Lung tissue fixation and analysis of metastatic lung tumor burden\nLung tissue inflation to maintain the structural format of the lungs for histopathology\n\t\nAfter approved euthanasia procedures (e.g. carbon dioxide at 30 - 70% displacement of the chamber volume/min) are followed, secure the mouse carcass to a dissecting board with pins. Either spray or apply 70% ethanol to keep the mouse’s fur out of the way during dissection. \n\t\tNOTE: Carbon dioxide asphyxiation can cause pulmonary hemorhhage as an expected background lesion, especially at slower flow rates.\nOpen the thorax with a midline incision, extend the incision cranially/caudally through the peritoneum, and cut away the diaphragm by grasping the xyphoid process.\nUsing a separate set of scissors to not dull the blades, cut the ribs along each side of the sternum and carefully remove rib cage leaving room for the lungs to expand.\nIsolate the trachea by removing submandibular salivary glands and infrahyoid musculature. Placing pins on either side of the trachea can prevent unwanted movement during needle insertion.\nFill a 26 G syringe with 2-3 mL of 10% neutral buffered formalin and insert into the trachea.\nSlowly inject formalin and watch for the lungs to expand (usually requires ~1.5 mL of formalin).",
    "Once formalin begins leaking out of the lungs (avoid over inflation), pinch off the trachea with a pair of forceps, remove syringe needle and detach the entire respiratory apparatus. Place lungs, heart, etc. directly into formalin as additional trimming of tissue can be done post-fixation.\nComplete processing, embedding, sectioning of tissue, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining using standard methods.\nAnalysis of metastatic lung tumor burden\n\t\nScan H&E-stained lung sections on a high-resolution, slide scanner at 40x magnification (Figure 3).\nImport images into image analysis software (e.g., Visiopharm Image Analysis) for quantification of lung metastases.\n\t\tNOTE: We recommend that new users either obtain onsite or online training to use the image analysis software. Numerous webinars are also available through the commercial webpage.\nSelect the Visiopharm 10118 H&E Lung Metastasis App from the software’s app library.\n\t\tNOTE: The purpose of this app is to label and quantify lung metastasis on H&E-stained slides. As part of the 10118 H&E Lung Metastasis App, the first image processing step segments the lung tissue with the Tissue Detection App. The second image processing step uses the Metastasis Detect App which identifies the metastases inside the lung tissue. Metastases are identified via shape together with regions that are either too misshaped, too red or too sparse for being identified as metastases.\nAdjust the parameters defining shape and sparseness to best fit representative images. Segmented areas of tumor metastases and normal lung tissue can be displayed using different color labels for each tissue type.",
    "NOTE: In the event that the app cannot accurately separate metastases from normal lung tissue, a custom app using the Visiopharm Decision Forest program may need to be written as was done for the experiments (see Figure 2 and Figure 3). Details for writing a custom algorithm follow below. Otherwise, proceed to step 2.2.9.\nOpen the Decision Forest program, which works by training multiple Classes [i.e., lung tissue (non-neoplastic), metastases, red blood cells, epithelium, and/or white space] on a desired image. In Figure 2, tumor metastases are blue, normal tissue is green, and bronchiolar epithelium is yellow. Also, red blood cells are in red and air spaces in pink.\nFollow the prompted series of yes or no questions to appropriately train each Class for an image. The accuracy of the algorithm will determine the number of yes/no questions. For the analysis, the custom algorithm/app was written with accuracy set to 50 (range 0-100).\nAdjust Features for each class by applying filters to sharpen, blur, sort by shape, etc. to enhance the accuracy of the algorithm/App. Visiopharm views each Class through one or multiple lenses known as Features. Features change how the Class sees the image to bring out certain colors or intensities.\n\t\tNOTE: For the custom algorithm, metastases measuring 8500 µm2 and above are labeled and measured as metastases. This accounts for size variance and metastases too small to detect. Small misshaped areas and small metastatic areas under 8500 µm2 were included in the normal tissue quantification.\nSave the modified settings from either the app or custom algorithm and then, apply the algorithm/app to an entire set or series of H&E-stained tissues.",
    "Finally, export all output variables, which includes those listed in Table 1. Area in microns squared (µm2) can be quantified for each tissue type and percentages are derived from specimen total net tissue area (i.e., total tissue minus air space).\nWhen creating a custom algorithm, review tissue markups in consultation with a veterinary pathologist board-certified by the American College of Veterinary Pathologists to ensure accurate measurements and differentiate between tissue types.\nSubscription Required.
