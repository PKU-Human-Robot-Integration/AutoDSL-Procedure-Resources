    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n2-DG treatment to induce NELFAhigh 2C-like mESCs\nTiming: 5 days\nIn our protocol, we use 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) treatment, which inhibits glycolysis, to boost the NELFAhigh 2C-like population in culture. We previously determined that 2-DG treatment for 4 days can lead to an 8-10-fold increase in the 2C-like population. Accordingly, we have determined the optimal seeding density to be 1.2 × 105 mESCs/well for a 6-well plate. This ratio can be scale up or down according to the culture dish size. Unless otherwise stated, the protocol described here details the instructions for a single well of a 6-well plate.\nSeed NELFA reporter mESCs at 1.2 × 105 per well of a 6-well plate in 3 mL of standard mESC medium containing LIF and 2i (1 μM PD0325901 and 3 μM CHIR99021).\nNote: LIF is a cytokine that is commonly used to maintain mESCs in an undifferentiated state, and 2i refers to the combination of two inhibitors - PD0325091; MEK inhibitor, and CHIR99021; GSK3 inhibitor, that further blocks mESC differentiation.\nCulture cells on gelatin coated (0.1% w/v, 24 h) 6-well plates in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nDiscard spent medium the following day and transfer 3 mL of fresh medium containing 4 mM 2-DG to the reporter cells. This is day 1 of treatment.\n2-DG is prepared fresh at a final concentration of 1 M in sterile water.",
    "Note: User would require 4 μL of 2-DG solution (1 M stock) per mL of culture medium. For example, if 3 mL of ESC medium is used, 12 μL of 2-DG 1 M stock solution is added fresh daily. To prepare the 2-DG solution (1 M stock), dissolve 2-DG powder in sterile water and adjust concentration to 1 M. Make 50 μL single use aliquots and store in −20°C for up to 6 months. We recommend discarding thawed leftovers, and to avoid freeze-thawing of 2-DG stock solution.\nDiscard spent medium the following day and transfer 3 mL of fresh medium containing 4 mM of 2-DG. Repeat this step until cells have been treated for a total of 4 days.\nCritical: Monitor reporter cells under a fluorescence microscope daily to determine if treatment is effective. 2-DG-treated cells tend to grow slower than untreated controls and exhibit a more ‘flattened’ cell morphology. In a successful experiment, there should be a gradual increase in the number of 2C-like cells that is most apparent on day 4 of treatment (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2062-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative fluorescence images and FACS analysis\n(A) Representative brightfield and fluorescence images of reporter mESCs undergoing 2-DG treatment.\n(B) Representative FACS plot of NELFA-EGFP reporter ESCs following 2-DG treatment for 4 days.\nPrepare cells for flow cytometry after 4 days of 2-DG treatment.\nDiscard culture medium by aspiration.\nWash 2C-reporter mESCs carefully twice with 2 mL of sterile PBS.\nDiscard PBS after second wash.\nAdd 0.3 mL of room temperature (22°C–25°C) 0.25% trypsin to dislodge the cells.\nIncubate cells at 37°C for 2 min during trypsin treatment.\nAdd 0.7 mL of mESC medium to quench trypsin.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature (22°C–25°C).",
    "Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL of mESC medium containing freshly prepared 4 mM 2-DG.\nStrain cells through a 40 μm cell strainer and place cells on ice until flow cytometry commences.\nFlow cytometry enrichment of 2C-like cells\nTiming: 2–3 h\nWe used a Sony Sy3200 cell sorter for our experiment but other cell sorters with the appropriate lasers can also be used. Should phenol-red present in the culture medium interferes with the cell sorting process, alternative cell medium such as indicator-free culture medium, or the commonly used flow medium (1× PBS, 2% (v/v) FBS) can be used. It is important to perform the entire experiment under sterile conditions to ensure the cells do not become contaminated.\nBegin by defining the negative and positive sorting gates (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2062-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative gating strategy for NELFA EGFP; mCherry double reporter ESCs during flow cytometry\nNote: In our study, we have used a double EGFP and mCherry reporter. Our gene of interest, NELFA, is reported by EGFP while mCherry is constitutively expressed to mark the injected cells. The latter will allow us to track the localization and fate of both EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative mESCs in the early embryos after injection.\nCritical: It is important to adopt a strict gating boundary for every flow cytometry setup by including negative control i.e., cells with no EGFP or mCherry to define boundaries for the positive cells.\nFine tune the plate voltages and laser intensities to obtain clear separation of singlets and doublets in the forward and side scatter plots.\nDefine boundaries for cells that are EGFP negative in the control group and record an average of 10,000 events for reference.\nUnload the control cells and rinse the cell sorter with sterile water for 2 min.\nLoad 2-DG treated mESCs.",
    "Record an average of 10,000 events for reference using the same voltages and laser intensity.\nFrom this plot, define boundaries of EGFP positive cells that show clear separation from the bulk EGFP negative population.\nWe typically bias for the top 2% brightest EGFP cells. Once the gates are determined, the sorting can begin.\nCells are sorted at the slowest speed setting using a 100 μm nozzle for ensuring maximal cell viability.\nDepending on the downstream applications, we typically sort 1 × 104 to 3 × 105 EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative cells respectively.\nNote: EGFP-positive and negative cells should be sort enriched separately to reduce chances of cross contamination during flow cytometry.\nSort cells into 5 mL collection tubes containing 1 mL of ESC medium supplemented with 4 mM 2-DG. The sorting chamber is chilled at 4°C throughout the whole sorting process.\nFlush the cell sorter briefly with FACS buffer, and analyze the sorted cells on the cell sorter to determine sort purity.\nCritical: It is crucial to perform post-sort purity checks on the sorted cells to verify that there is minimal cross contamination between the EGFP-positive and negative populations, and that all cells are mCherry-positive.\nOnce the intended cell numbers for each population are obtained and placed on ice, set up a second sort to obtain another set of EGFP negative and positive populations using the same gating parameters.\nFlush cell sorter with sterile water for 2 min and the respective enriched cell populations from the second sort is loaded iteratively into the cell sorter to determine sorting purity.\nRecord an average of 10,000 events and obtain ∼95% pure EGFP positive and populations.",
    "If the post-sorting purity is sub-optimal i.e., less than 80%, the user should consider recalibrating the cell sorter’s laser with fluorophore standards and repeat the cell sorting procedure with more stringent gating i.e., defining the EGFP positive boundary even further away from the EGFP negative population.\nFlow sorted cells are transported on ice promptly for embryo microinjection.\nCritical: In the same batch of sorted cells for embryo injection, we typically set aside some cells for gene expression profiling with qPCR to ensure that the prototypic 2C restricted transcripts such as MERVL, Dux, and Zscan4c (Macfarlan et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Hendrickson et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Hu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Akiyama et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) are upregulated in the EGFP-positive cells compared to the EGFP-negative population. Additionally, a subset of the sorted cells can be re-cultured on gelatin-coated plates to assess cell viability and sterility post-sorting.\nEmbryo microinjection\nTiming: 2 days\nWe inject either NELFAhigh or NELFAlow mESCs with good survival status into mouse 8-cell stage embryos to generate chimeric blastocysts. The injected embryos are cultured for 2 days before immunofluorescence staining.\nCollect flow cytometry enriched mESCs via centrifugation at 200 g for 3 min at 4°C.\nDiscard FACS buffer supernatant and carefully resuspend the cells with 500 μL of M2 culture medium. Re-suspended cells are kept at 4°C until injection.\nNote: We typically sort 1 × 104 to 3 × 105 EGFP-positive (NELFAhigh) and EGFP-negative (NELFAlow) cells respectively during each flow cytometry session and resuspend the cells in 500 μL of M2 medium. Care is taken to resuspend cells gently to maintain cell viability and to obtain uniform suspension of single cells to facilitate downstream injection.\nPrior to harvesting embryos for injection, pre-warm M2 and KSOM media in a 37°C incubator supplemented with 5% CO2.\nMouse embryo harvesting.",
    "Sacrifice the donor ICR female mice by cervical dislocation at 2.5 days post-coitum (dpc) (Behringer et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nImmediately dissect out the fallopian tubes.\nUse a sterile 3 mL syringe with 27G needle to flush pre-warmed M2 medium into the fallopian tube to harvest the 8-cell stage embryos.\nUse a mouth pipette to transfer the embryos to a petri dish filled with pre-warmed KSOM medium.\nIn a separate petri dish, wash the harvested embryos 5 times in drops (50 μL per drop) of pre-warmed KSOM medium iteratively.\nCarefully mouth pipette the embryos to the first drop of KSOM.\nTransfer the embryos from the first drop to second drop of KSOM medium.\nSteps i-ii are repeated until the embryos are transferred to the 5th drop of KSOM medium.\nPick the healthy 8-cell stage embryos from the pool of washed embryos, and set aside in a separate petri dish containing pre-warmed KSOM medium (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2062-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative images showing the healthy 8-cell embryo (left) and abnormal 8-cell embryo (right)\nPlace healthy embryos in a 37°C incubator supplemented with 5% CO2 until injection.\nNote: It is important to pre-warm the KSOM medium in the 37°C incubator for at least 30 min in advance.\nEmbryo microinjection.\nPrepare the holding and injection pipettes using the micropipette puller and microforge. Thereafter, setup and adjust the holding and injection pipettes (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2062-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

(Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nCover 50 μL of M2 medium drops completely with 200 μL of mineral oil.\nCarefully mouth pipette 8–10 embryos into each M2-mineral droplet (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nRetrieve the FACS sorted mESCs from 4°C and gently pipette to mix.\nCarefully mouth pipette the sorted cells into a glass capillary, ensuring that there are no bubbles (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nFor each droplet containing the embryos, release a small number of mESCs into each droplet.\nPlace the prepared petri dish on the stage of an inverted light microscope.\nCarefully transfer the holding and injection pipettes into the droplets containing the embryos and mESCs.\nInject 5–7 NELFAhigh or NELFAlow mESCs into the cell space of 8-cell stage embryos by piercing through the zona pellucida (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E and 5F).\nTransfer carefully the injected chimeric embryos into a fresh petri dish containing KSOM medium and place in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 48 h before immunofluorescence staining (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2062-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Representative images of mouse embryos after injection of NELFAhigh mESCs. Scale bar are at 100 μm.\nNote: We typically perform injection in batches of 10 embryos during each session to minimize the time that the harvested embryo spends outside the incubator as unfavourable conditions will affect embryo development post-injection.\nImmunofluorescence (IF) staining on injected embryos\nTiming: 2 days\nIt is important to minimize disruption of the embryos post-injection. Do not remove the embryos from the incubator frequently as this will cause development to arrest.",
    "Remove the injected embryos from the incubator when developmental timepoint reaches approximately late E4.5 stage.\nCarefully remove the microinjected chimeric embryos using a mouth pipette and wash the embryos 3–4 times in consecutive 100 μL drops of PBS with 1% BSA.\nFix the embryos with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature (22°C–25°C) for 15 min.\nNote: It is important to wash the embryos in PBS containing BSA to prevent the embryos from sticking to the glass capillary and ensure that the PFA solution covers the embryos entirely.\nCarefully transfer the embryos using a mouth pipette into a 4-well dish containing PBS with 1% BSA. Aspirate and discard the PFA as per institutional safety regulations.\nDispense sufficient PBS + 1% BSA (∼0.5 mL) such that it covers the embryo completely and incubate at room temperature (22°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nStep 5 is repeated twice for a total of 3 wash steps. The addition of BSA in the wash buffer prevents the embryos from sticking to the glass capillary during transfer.\nNote: Embryos may be stored in sterile PBS + 1% BSA at 4°C for several days until the next step. Ensure that there is sufficient liquid covering the embryos to prevent dry up. For longer storage, cover the PBS containing the embryos with a layer of mineral oil to prevent evaporation.\nPermeabilize and block the embryos with IF blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature (22°C–25°C).\nDuring the blocking step incubation, prepare primary antibody dilutions in IF blocking buffer.\nDetermine the optimal primary antibody dilutions empirically. For a start, follow the recommended IF dilution by the antibody manufacturer.\nSetup IF staining for both mCherry (1:400) and Cdx2 (1:250), a trophectoderm marker (Hu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).",
    "Gently aspirate and remove the blocking buffer from the well and add the primary antibody solution to the embryos.\nIncubate the primary antibody for 12 h at 4°C.\nNote: We fill up any unused wells on the culture dish with 1× PBS to reduce evaporation of the primary antibody solution.\nNext day, carefully transfer the embryos using a mouth pipette into a 4-well dish containing IF blocking buffer and incubate at room temperature (22°C–25°C) for 5 min. Aspirate and discard the primary antibody solution.\nRepeat step 26 for a total of 3 washes.\nPrepare the secondary antibody dilutions. We have used 1: 500 dilution for Alexa Fluor 594 (for staining mCherry) and 1:250 dilution for Alexa Fluor 647 (for staining Cdx2). Additionally, we co-stain DAPI (1:1,000) simultaneously with the respective secondary antibodies.\nFor 1 well of embryos, add 1 μL of Alexa Fluor 594 Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L), 2 μL of Alexa Fluor 647 Rabbit Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) and 0.5 μL of DAPI solution into 0.5 mL of IF blocking buffer.\nPerform secondary antibody incubation at room temperature (22°C–25°C) for 1 h, protected from light.\nAfter incubation, discard the secondary antibody solution carefully and transfer the embryos into another well containing IF blocking buffer.\nIncubate at room temperature (22°C–25°C) for 5 min.\nDiscard the IF blocking buffer and repeat steps 15 and 16 for a total 3 washes.\nWash the embryos once with 1× PBS + 1% BSA.\nIn preparation for confocal imaging, we typically make a microdrop of PBS on the glass surface of a 35 mm glass-bottom dish and cover with mineral oil. Carefully transfer the embryos into the microdrops on the imaging dish using a mouth pipette.\nAcquire the images using the appropriate confocal microscope configurations.",
    "Note: The fixed embryos may be kept in the imaging dish covered with mineral oil to prevent evaporation and stored at 4°C for several weeks. Ensure that PBS is sterile and/or add sodium azide to prevent bacterial growth and contamination."
