    "All animal studies were undertaken in compliance with the regulations of the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Near Infrared (NIR) Fluorescence Imaging of Skeletal Collagen Remodeling In vivo\nPhoto-activation of the caged CMP and tail vein injection\nPrepare 110 µl of caged CMP solution for each mouse (20-30 g mouse weight): 100 µl of solution for dosing, with an extra 10 µl cushion for the possible loss during transfer and injection. Mix 11 µl of IR680-Ahx-NB(GPO)9 stock solution (400 µM) with 11 µl of 100 µM cysteine in sterile PBS solution; then bring the total volume to 110 µl with 1x PBS buffer. The final peptide solution contains 4 nmol of IR680-Ahx-NB(GPO)9 and 1 nmol of cysteine in 100 µl of 1x PBS solution.\nSlowly withdraw the peptide solution into a 0.5 ml insulin syringe with a transparent barrel and a small gauge (28-30 G) needle, and carefully remove the air bubbles. Turn on the UV lamp to allow the lamp to warm up for 2-5 min.\nPlace the peptide-containing syringe directly under the UV lamp (365 nm, >25 mW/cm2) for 5 min to allow photo-activation.\nMeanwhile, position the mouse in a restrainer under a heated lamp;  label the mouse with a permanent marker on the tail or other identification methods such as ear tag or toe tattoo, and disinfect the tail with 70% alcohol.\nImmediately after the UV activation, inject 100 µl of UV-activated IR680-Ahx-NB(GPO)9 solution into the tail vein, preferentially at the posterior part of the tail. Place the mouse back to the cage after injection.\nNIR fluorescence imaging of collagen remodeling activity\nSet the heater plate of the imaging bed of the impulse imager to 37 °C using Pearl Impulse 2.0 software.",
    "Put the nude or shaved mouse into the anesthesia induction chamber containing 2% isoflurane in oxygen. Verify depth of anesthesia plane by lack of mouse movement during handling and by monitoring the frequency of respirations (~1/sec).\nAfter the mouse is anesthetized, open the Pearl imager drawer, and place the animal on the imaging bed. Quickly remove the nose cone plug, and slide the mouse's muzzle inside the nose cone to keep the mouse under anesthesia (by 2% isoflurane in oxygen delivered at 2 L/min through the nose cone) during the imaging process. Once the mouse is in place, close the drawer.\nWhen the instrument indicates \"ready\" on the Image software panel, click the \"700 channel,\" \"white light\" and \"85 micron\" boxes followed by the \"acquire image\" button. NIR (excitation 685 nm, emission 720 nm) and white light photographs will then be taken using automatic focus and exposure.\nWhen the recording is completed, open the drawer, turn the mouse, and acquire images from another angle. The mouse can be placed with its front (ventral), back (dorsal) or sides facing the camera. Narrow strips of tape can be used as restraints to stretch its limbs to get the best view of the region of interest (e.g. rib cage, ankles, and wrists).\nA proper time to observe skeletal uptake of IR680-CMP is between 24-96 hr post injection (h.p.i.), based on the dosage (~4 nmol/mouse). To acquire high resolution images, sacrifice the mouse by cervical dislocation while under deep anesthesia after 72 h.p.i, remove the skin (and hair) using surgical forceps and scissors, and image it by NIR fluorescence as described above.\nAnalyze the acquired NIR fluorescence images.\n2. Visualization of Collagens in Ex vivo Tissue Sections\nMaterial preparation",
    "Prepare 1 ml of 10% (w/v) BSA solution in deionized water. Thaw 1 ml of goat serum in a water bath at room temperature. Cut a few pieces of Parafilm in the size of approximately 2 cm x 5 cm.\nPrepare 10 ml of blocking buffer by mixing 500 µl of goat serum, 1 ml of 10x PBS and 8.5 ml of deionized water. Prepare 5 ml of CMP dilution buffer by diluting 50 µl of 10% (w/v) BSA with 4.45 ml of deionized water and 500 µl 10x PBS.\nDilute stock solutions of carboxyfluorescein-labeled caged CMP, CFNB(GPO)9 (480 µM), to 5 µM using the CMP dilution buffer. Optimal CMP concentration varies from 2.5-30 µM, depending on the type of tissues and the nature of tissue samples. A volume of 100 µl is recommended for staining one tissue section slide. Store the formulated CMP solutions in dark.\nLet the mouse cornea tissue slides equilibrate to room temperature. Incubate the slides in 1x PBS buffer for 5 min. The mouse cornea tissues used in this demonstration have been prefixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution for 1 hr, cryopreserved in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. medium, cryosectioned to 8 µm thickness, and mounted on charged glass slides.\nTissue staining and imaging\nPlace the slides in a humidified chamber. To each slide, apply 0.5 ml of blocking solution and incubate the slides for 30 min at room temperature. Remove the blocking solution by blotting the slides on a paper towel.\nApply approximately 100 µl of CFNB(GPO)9 solutions to cover the tissue sections of each slide. Incubate the slides for 2 min to allow the CMP solution to permeate the tissues.",
    "Turn on the UV lamp. When the lamp is warmed up, expose the CMP-covered tissue sections to the UV light for 6 min (365 nm, ~8 mW/cm2) to deprotect the caged CMPs. After UV exposure, cover the tissue sections of each slide with a piece of Parafilm to prevent drying. Place the slides in the humidified chamber and incubate them at 4 °C for 2 hr.\nPrepare a 1:3,000 dilution of DAPI solution in 1x PBS. After CMP staining, gently remove the Parafilm with forceps, and blot the slides on a paper towel to remove excess CMP solution. Apply approximately 100 µl of diluted DAPI solutions to each tissue slide and incubate for 1 min at room temperature.\nAfter staining, immerse the slides in 1x PBS buffer in a staining jar for 5 min. Repeat this 3x in fresh 1x PBS to wash off unbound staining agents.\nAdd a drop of mounting medium on the tissue section and cover it with a glass cover slip while avoiding trapping air bubbles. Put the slides in a cardboard slide tray to protect them from light.\nImage the collagen strands (FITC channel) and cell nuclei (DAPI channel) in the tissue slides using a fluorescence microscope."
