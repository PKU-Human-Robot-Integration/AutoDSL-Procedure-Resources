    "Note: All animal procedures were in accordance with the NIH guidelines and were approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Committee on Animal Care.\n1. Illuminator Fabrication\nUse a pair of sharp shears to cut a section of 250 µm diameter plastic optical fiber that is at least 10 cm longer than the desired total illuminator length.\nRemove 15 - 20 cm of polyethylene jacket from one end of the plastic optical fiber using a 22 gauge wire stripper.\nSecure the distal most 3 - 5 cm of the stripped end of the fiber in a table vise clamp.\nHold the jacketed end of the fiber taut in one hand with a constant steady pull. The fiber should be parallel to the floor, perpendicular to the vice. Maintain this constant tension on the fiber throughout heating and cooling (Steps 1.5 and 1.6 below) so that the fiber remains straight and taut as it thins.\nUsing the lowest setting of a dual temperature heat gun (570/1,000 °F,), heat the stripped section of the fiber until it is thinned to a diameter of 60 - 100 μm, or about the diameter of a human hair.\nMaintain the constant tension on the fiber while allowing the fiber to cool. Failure to maintain tension may cause the fiber to curl.\nConfirm the diameter of the thinned tip under a dissecting microscope. Alternately, one may use calipers instead.\n\t\nIf the fiber is not thin enough, repeat steps 1.4 through 1.6 as needed to achieve the desired tip diameter.\nOptional if re-pulling, put a small mark at the narrowest portion of the fiber if it will be heated again so that the center of the heat gun targets the narrowest portion of the fiber.\nIf the fiber is too thin, start over.",
    "Once the fiber has full cooled and the desired diameter has been achieved, pinch the fiber 3 cm from the narrowest point on either side. With a quick, sharp pull along the axis of the fiber, separate the sides to create a tapered tip.\nExamine the tapered tip under a low power (e.g., 4X) on dissection microscope. If the tip is forked or curled (Figure 1f), discard the fiber.\nPrepare to etch the tapered tip by placing a piece of lab tape near the end of the tip, leaving the last 5 mm exposed. The tape protects the fiber from etching above the desired length of light emission. This tip length was selected based on thickness of primate cortex in the target region. A longer or shorter length could be exposed depending on the desired length of illumination. If a different etch tip length is desired, the edge of the lab tape can be moved closer to or farther from the tapered tip.\nFold a small (~1 inch x 2 inch) square of 5 μm silicon carbide lapping sheet over between the thumb and forefinger. Place the tip of the fiber between the two sides of the lapping sheet and gently etch the fiber using small circular motions, as if rolling a BB between the thumb and forefinger. Frequently rotate the fiber so that all sides are etched evenly. The fiber tip will appear “roughened” to the naked eye in areas that have been etched, while un-etched areas typically appear smooth.\nRepeat step 1.11 with a 3 μm aluminum oxide lapping sheet.\nAffix a connector on the end of the illuminator opposite to the etched tip. This allows the illuminator to connect to an optical cable or laser.",
    "Note: This method differs from the preferred method for fixing glass / silica optical fibers in ferrules. Because the metal ferrule is harder than the plastic optical fiber, polishing the fiber and ferrule as a unit after gluing can damage the plastic optical fiber as tiny shards of metal produced during the polishing process can embed themselves in flat-cleaved fiber.\n\t\nRemove about 5 mm of the polyethylene jacket from the opposite end of the illuminator using a 22 gauge wire stripper.\nCut the opposite end flat with a hot knife to smooth the surface.\nPolish the opposite end flat with successively finer lapping sheets: 5 µm, 3 μm, 1 μm and 0.3 µm.\nInsert the flat opposite end into a 260 µm inner diameter stainless steel ferrule until it is flush with the end of the ferrule.\nVisually confirm that the opposite end is smoothly and evenly polished with a fiber microscope.\nRemove the fiber from the ferrule and tape the ferrule vertically on the edge of a table with the fiber pointing down.\nFill a 1 mL syringe with plastic epoxy and attach a blunt 18 gauge needle to the syringe.\nUse the needle to apply epoxy down into the ferrule. Fill the ferrule completely with epoxy.\nInsert the fiber into the ferrule.\nWipe any excess epoxy from polished surface of the fiber with a wet lint-free wipe prior to drying if needed. Otherwise, excess epoxy can be removed after 12 - 24 h.\nStore the fiber gently until calibration and place a dust cap over the ferrule.\n2. Illuminator Calibration and Quality Control\nNote: These methods for calibration assess for light output non-linearity at different distances from the tip of the fiber. Uneven light distribution typically results from a “bumpy” or “wavy” taper.",
    "Create a light shielding diaphragm for the top of the integrating sphere using light absorbing foil (Figure 2).\nNote: Wear gloves whenever handling light absorbing foil to prevent skin oils from creating light reflecting smudges.\n\t\nFold a 2” by 4” piece of light absorbing foil over on itself to form a 2” x 2” square.  An alternative method is to cut a 2” x 2” square with one light absorbing side and one light reflecting side (i.e., a side of standard aluminum foil); however, the fold-over method is safer because it provides a dull edge for handling the diaphragm in the next step. \nFold lab tape or electrical tape along the edges of the square to bind the non-folded edges. This both holds the sides together and protects against cuts from sharp edges.\nPuncture a hole in the center of the square using a 26 gauge needle.\nRemove the large screw on cap from the integrating sphere and cover the opening with the diaphragm. Place the hole over the center. If the diaphragm was created with one light absorbing and one light reflecting side, place the light absorbing side up and the light reflecting side down, facing the inside of the integrating sphere.\nNote: To prevent dust and debris from entering the integrating sphere and to keep the hole centered, secure the diaphragm to the outside of the integrating sphere with lab tape.\nMeasure light output along the tip in 500 µm increments using a micromanipulator or stereotaxic arm and an integrating sphere.\nNote: Safety goggles of the appropriate wavelength should be worn whenever the laser is on.\n\t\nConnect the opposite end of the fiber to a laser or light source, but do not trigger light output yet.",
    "Secure the illuminator to a stereotaxic holder (preferably with lab tape) with the tip 7 - 10 mm below the bottom of the holder.\nScrew the stereotaxic holder into the stereotaxic arm.\nAlign the tip of the illuminator with the hole in the center of the diaphragm. Zero the micromanipulator when the tip is at the exact same level as the diaphragm.\nTurn off the room lights and zero the integrating sphere.\nTrigger the laser (or other light source) and measure the total light power output using the integrating sphere.\nNote: Use the lowest light output possible for calibration testing.\nLower the fiber 500 µm into the integrating sphere and repeat step 2.2.6.\nContinue lowering the fiber into the integrating sphere and measuring total light output in 500 µm increments until the total light power levels off.\nCaution: Total light power should level off once the entire tip is in the sphere. Do not continue to lower the fiber more than 1 - 2 mm beyond the etched tip length. If the tip contacts the bottom of the integrating sphere, it may melt and/or ruin the integrating sphere.\nConfirm an evenly etched fiber by plotting total light power output as a function of how far the fiber has been lowered into the integrating sphere to confirm linearity.\n3. In Vivo Illumination\nNote: Here, these methods are shown using a plastic model rather than a non-human primate.\nImplant a 25 mm diameter recording chamber was implanted over the brain area of interest prior to experimentation.\nPerform anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to experimentation. Place a custom recording grid in the chamber and fill it with sterile surgical lubricant to allow for grid visualization and determination of the level of the dura and target brain structures.",
    "Prepare a tower micro-drive prior to each testing session.\n\t\nAffix a 25 gauge guide tube with beveled tip to the middle and lower clamps on the drive. Two clamps are used to ensure that the guide tube remains straight. Both of these clamps can be moved manually if desired.\nNote: The guide tube may be epoxied or soldered to the clamps.\nSecure the large volume illuminator in the upper clamp on the same drive. This clamp is attached to the drive motor.\nThread the large-volume illuminator through the guide tube fully and confirm that the tip of the illuminator extends past the tip of the guide tube.\nNote: The length of illuminator that extends past the tip of the guide tube equals the distance from the dura to the lower margin of the target brain region, as determined via MRI.\nSoak the guide tube and illuminator in antiseptic solution (e.g., chlorohexidine) to sterilize.\nPlace a custom sterilized grid inside the clean chamber and secure it at a pre-specified orientation with a screw on the side of the chamber. The grid shown here has 1 mm spacing; however, the spacing can be customized as needed.\nNote: This should be identical to the grid and orientation used in the anatomical MRI.\nSecure the stereotactic micro-drive holder on the recording chamber in a pre-determined orientation.\nRetract the sterilized illuminator from the guide tube by pulling the illuminator up using sterile, blunt forceps. The tip of the illuminator should be 5 - 10 mm above the tip of guide tube.\nNote: The illuminator will bow outward between the guide tube and the clamp. This will not damage the flexible illuminator.\nAffix the micro-drive to the holder and place the guide tube into target grid hole.",
    "Lower the micro-drive stage until the guide tube is just through the level of the dura.\nNote: If desired, a second micro-drive with an electrode can be placed on the stage and lowered into a different grid hole. The local field potential on this electrode will show a distance-dependent light artifact, which can be used to confirm illuminator placement.\nAttempt the lower the illuminator manually with sterile forceps.\n\t\nIf there is any resistance, retract the illuminator 5 - 10 mm, wait 10 min to allow the tissue to settle and try again.\nIf there is still resistance on the second attempt, retract the illuminator tip into the guide tube, lower the guide tube 0.25 mm, and try again.\nRepeat until the illuminator slides through the guide tube without any resistance.\nLower the illuminator until it is taut.\nCaution: Do not push the illuminator forcefully against resistance. In these cases the guide tube typically has not penetrated the dura fully. Pushing the fiber forcefully will cause it to bend on itself, preventing the fiber from entering the brain and possibly destroying the tip (Figure 1g).\nConnect the ferrule on the other end of the illuminator to the larger optics set up or laser.\nEnsure that no light is visible to the non-human primate.\n\t\nUse black-out shielding or light absorbing foil to fully encompass the recording towers.\nPlace all optical connections in shielded envelopes made of light absorbing foil.\nShield all patch cables with either light absorbing foil or black electrical tape.",
    "As an extra precaution, place a decoy light-emitting diode (LED) bank of the same light color used in the experiment behind the non-human primate and flash the LEDs continuously at 2.5 Hz. This prevents the eyes from adjusting fully to darkness. If there were inadvertent light leakage, this flashing light would help to prevent the leak from serving as a behavioral trigger.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
