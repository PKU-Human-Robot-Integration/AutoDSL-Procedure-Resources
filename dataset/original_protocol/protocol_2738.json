Primary corneal HSV-1 infection\nPrior to the corneal HSV-1 infection, the smoothness of the corneal surface before and after scratching at 40X magnification. Scale bars, 1mm.\nCritical: During the topical application, ensure the pipette tip touches the corneal surface.\nAfter viral inoculation, lay down the anesthetized mice sideways in a disposable microisolator cage with infected eye facing up.\nKeep the cage with anesthetized mice on a heating pad.\nNote: The warmth from the heating pad prevents inadvertent hypothermia in anesthetized mice.",
    "Provide the corncob bedding and a water bottle along with feed pellets in the microisolator cages following mice recovery from anesthesia (recovery time: 90–120 min).\nHouse infected mice in AAALAC-accredited pathogen-free animal facility.\nMonitor the development of HSK in infected eyes every other day using a hand-held slit lamp microscope under the class II Biosafety Cabinet.\nNote: Assign the corneal opacity and hemangiogenesis score as reported.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nUse the mouse with severe HSK to separate the corneal epithelium and corneal stroma followed by the preparation of a single-cell suspension for flow cytometry assay.\nCritical: The corneal opacity score >3.0 and angiogenesis score >12 in infected eyes is considered as severe HSK.\nSeparation of corneal epithelium and single cell preparation for flow cytometry\nTiming: 1.5 h for media preparation and mice euthanasia, 16 h overnight incubation- a day prior to staining\nTiming: 2.5–3 h on the day of staining\nThis step enables the successful peeling of mouse corneal epithelial sheets and describes how to make single-cell suspensions from the individual epithelial sheet for FACS staining.

The triangular shaped pellet is shown within the black outline.\n(I) Counting of epithelial cells with 1:5 dilution with Trypan blue.\nEuthanize the mouse with overexposure to Isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation.\nEnucleate the eyeballs with curved forceps.\nPlace the eyeballs in a 24-well plate containing 1 mL of Dispase® II digestion media/well as stated under materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] (One well for one eyeball).\nIncubate the plate at 4°C on an orbital shaker set at orbital speed of 33 rpm for 16 h.\nPause point: Ensure the orbital shaker stays ON during the entire incubation period.\nAt the end of incubation, place the eyeball in 150–200 μL of Dispase® II digestion media in a 60 mm × 15 mm petri dish with the cornea facing sideways.\nUnder the stereo microscope, peel off the epithelial sheet with straight forceps.\nNote: The epithelial sheet should be peeled off without exerting excessive force. It takes around a min to peel off a single epithelial sheet.\nCritical: If working with more than five eyeballs, take the eyeballs out of the digestion media and dip them in 1 mL of PBS to prevent over-digestion while processing other samples.\nCarefully add individual epithelial sheet in 500 μL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA in 1.7mL Eppendorf tubes (already kept on ice).\nIncubate the tubes at 37°C in a CO2 incubator for 6 min.\nPipette up and down to homogenize the solution.\nCritical: Proceed to the next step once all clumps are homogenized. This step is crucial for making a single-cell suspension.",
    "Add 500 μL of ice-cold 2 mg/mL Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor in each tube to deactivate trypsin.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4°C in a 5424/5424R centrifuge.\nAfter centrifugation, gently aspirate the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with 1mL of complete supplemented RPMI media as stated under working solutions.\nFinally, resuspend the pellet in 250 μL of complete supplemented RPMI media. Pipette up and down 5–6 times.\nVortex the tubes and proceed with counting.\nUse 20 μL of the cell suspension and dilute 1:5 with 0.4% solution of Trypan Blue in PBS.\nNote: From the naïve epithelium, we can get around 1×105–1.5×105 cells while in the HSV-1 infected epithelium, these numbers increase to 2.5×105–3.0×105 cells per corneal epithelium.\nPlace the tubes on ice until ready to plate.\nCritical: Be cautious while peeling the epithelial sheet and transferring it to Trypsin-EDTA. It is easier to lose the epithelial sheet because of its transparency. The tubes containing Trypsin-EDTA should be kept on ice to delay trypsin digestion, as it will take some time to peel off the epithelial sheets from all the samples.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Peeling of intact epithelial sheet from C57BL/6 mouse cornea, related to step# 16\nDissection and digestion of corneal stroma for flow cytometry\nTiming: 2–3 h on the day of staining depending on the number of samples\nThis step enables the successful dissection of mouse corneal stroma from enucleated eyeballs after peeling off the corneal epithelial sheets. This step also describes how to make single cell suspensions from an individual dissected corneal stroma for FACS staining.

    "In a medium petri dish (60 mm × 15 mm), place a 70 μm cell strainer.\nNote: Add 1 mL of complete supplemented RPMI media through the cell strainer. This step will moisten the cell strainer.\nEmpty the Eppendorf tube containing the enzyme digested stroma on the cell strainer.\nUse a 3 mL-syringe plunger to gently homogenize the tissue to make a single cell suspension.\nNote: Rinse the strainer thoroughly with complete supplemented RPMI media.\nTransfer the contents of the Petri dish to a 15 mL conical tube.\nAdd 1 mL of complete supplemented RPMI media to the Eppendorf tube and repeat step 35 through 37, three times.\nCritical: The digested stroma after 30 min may have some visible tissue pieces left depending on the severity of HSK. An extra caution is needed to prevent the loss of any tissues while transferring the contents of the tubes to cell strainer placed inside the petri dish.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL tubes at 211 × g for 10 min at 4°C in a 5810R centrifuge.\nTake out the tubes and carefully discard the supernatant leaving about 500 μL media at the bottom.\nGently vortex the tube to break the cell pellet at the bottom.\nPlace the tubes on ice until ready to plate.\nCell surface staining for flow cytometry and acquisition\nTiming: 5 h on the day of staining\nThis step describes how to perform FACS staining of freshly prepared corneal epithelial and stromal cells for flow cytometry using LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain and fluorochrome conjugated cell-surface antibodies.\nPlate single cell suspension of corneal epithelial and stromal cells in 96 well U-bottom plate on ice.\nCentrifuge plate for 4 min at 475 × g at 4°C.\nRemove/flick off supernatant and add 200 μL of ice-cold DPBS.",

    "Set the appropriate PMT voltage.\nCritical: Set the Forward Scatter Area (FSC-A) -180 and Side Scatter Area (SSC-A)- 250 for epithelial cells, and FSC-A 216 and SSC-A 280 for corneal stromal cells.\nNote: The PMT voltage settings for the fluorochromes remains the same for corneal epithelial and corneal stromal cells.\nUse compensation beads for reliable and precise gating, thereby minimizing fluorescence spillover.\nAcquire the maximum possible events from each sample and analyze data using FlowJo version 10."
