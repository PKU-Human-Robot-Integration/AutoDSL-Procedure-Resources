    "Animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Science and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 86-23, revised 1985). All experiments were approved by the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (BMWF-66.011/0071-II/3b/2012).\n1. Arterial catheterization\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine10 and an analgesic according to local practice (e.g. buprenorphine).  Pinch the hind limbs with forceps to confirm the correct depth of anesthesia.\n\tNOTE: For this study, male C57BL/6N mice at the age of 8−12 weeks were used (weight 20−25 g). The authors have tested male BALB/c of the same age unsuccessfully but have not tried other strains (see Discussion).\nRemove the hair in the regions of interest (head, neck) using an electric razor. Ensure that no loose hair remains to prevent wound contamination. Subsequently disinfect the surgical field with 70% ethanol/chlorhexidine/ betadine and place the mouse supine with the head facing the surgeon.\nMake a cervical midline incision with dissecting scissors.\nDissect the submandibular glands and neck muscle tissue and separate them in order to expose the common carotid artery. Use mostly blunt dissection via forceps.\nPlace three 8-0 silk ligatures beneath the right common carotid artery.\nPlace a clamp on the proximal ligature and bring tension in the artery so that the flow is suspended.\nClose the most distal ligature.\nInsert the arterial catheter through a small, preformed skin hole on the cranial aspect of the incision. Squeeze and deform the lumen of the catheter if it appears too large to reduce blood backflow. Fixate with all three ligatures.",
    "Fixate the catheter to the skin to avoid dislocation. Do this by using a suture (e.g., 5-0 monofilament, non-absorbable) which connects the catheter to the skin in the area of the preformed skin hole.\n2. Tracheostomy\nDissect the pre-tracheal musculature bluntly using forceps.\nPlace two 8-0 silk ligatures beneath the trachea.\nTracheotomize using micro scissors as proximally as possible to avoid unilateral ventilation. Use a horizontal cutting line between two tracheal cartilages.\nInsert the ventilation tube and fixate with both prepared ligatures.\n\tNOTE: The proximal end of the trachea does not need to be ligated.\nClose the skin with a running suture (e.g., 6-0 monofilament, non-absorbable).\nVentilate the mouse with a frequency of 150/min and a tidal volume of 200 µL.\n3. Brain death induction\nArrange the mouse to the prone position.\nRemove the skin from the skull using surgical scissors and forceps to hold the skin.\nDrill a 1 mm caliber borehole paramedially above the left parietal cortex. Stop drilling before breaching the inner compact bone and the dura mater.\nPenetrate the final tissue bridge of the skull using blunt forceps, removing sharp edges.\nInsert the balloon catheter, so that it is entirely within the cranial cavity. Ensure that the balloon is prefilled with saline and all air is evacuated.\nBegin inflation at ~0.1 mL/min over a period of 10−15 min (total volume of 0.8−1.2 mL) with the help of a syringe pump.\n\tNOTE: The mouse will exhibit myoclonus, mydriasis, further seizure activity and agonal gasps.\nPronounce the mouse brain dead once the tail of the mouse has gone stiff and erected.",
    "NOTE: BD is confirmed by a characteristic initial blood pressure peak (Cushing reflex), the absence of brain stem reflexes and spontaneous breathing. Regular apnea testing should be avoided during experiments, as mice may become circulatory instable due to a lack of oxygen.\nStop the inflation of the balloon catheter.\nPut a heating blanket over the mouse to avoid hypothermia.\n4. During BD period\nMonitor and document blood pressure regularly. Exclude mice with a prolonged hypotensive phase (mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 50 mmHg for >30 min).\nInfuse 0.1 mL of saline every 30 min to stabilize the blood pressure of the mouse.\n\tNOTE: In total 0.8 mL of saline was administered to each mouse in this study.\nAfter 4 h of BD duration, harvest mouse organs/tissues. Exclude the mouse from the experiment if the heart of the mouse is not beating at the end of the experiment.\n5. Sham procedure\nPerform steps 1.1−3.3.\n\tNOTE: Do not open the inner compact bone. Do not insert or inflate a balloon catheter.\nStay close to the mouse and continuously observe the animal. Repeatedly pinch the hind limbs with forceps to confirm the correct depth of anesthesia. Apply additional anesthesia subcutaneously (approximately 1/2 of the starting dose) if the mouse shows signs of awakening, which, to our experience, happens approximately after 2−3 h post-anesthesia.  \nApply the same amount of intravenous saline as in the BD mice.\n\tNOTE: The sham mouse will regain spontaneous breathing after cessation of ventilation. The BD mouse will not. Apnea testing should be done while establishing the model, but during experiments it should be avoided due to unnecessary physiological stress.\nSubscription Required.
