    "The protocol follows the guidelines of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital’s Human Research Ethics Committee. Ethical approval for the experiment was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the hospital (IRB No. 201600593B0).\n1. Patient position and skin marking\nAfter general anesthesia, place the patient in a supine position on the operating table, with the head gently rotated to the contralateral side and elevated 15–30°.\nElevate the head of the bed approximately 15–30° to avoid blood recruitment to middle and inner ear and decrease bleeding.\nUse an electrophysiologic facial nerve monitor to assist the surgeon in facial nerve location and dissection.\n\t\nUse the detector probe to touch the suspected facial nerve or tissue to make sure that the operating direction is correct.\nSet a current of 1 A on the monitor. If the monitor alarms, stop the procedure. Then, decrease the current to 0.5 A and 0.2 A to ensure that the facial nerve will not be damaged.\n2. Local anesthesia and incision in the ear canal\nUsing a 3 mL syringe with a 21 G needle, provide local anesthesia by injecting the anesthetic (2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine) subcutaneously to the external auditory meatus until the skin of ear canal become blanching.\nAfter sterilizing the surgical area, including the external auditory canal, use a round knife to make a circumferential skin incision of the ear canal (EAC) at the osseo-cartilaginous junction.\nUse a round knife to carefully elevate the lateral EAC skin to form a skin flap for postoperative closure of the ear canal.\nUse the cotton ball soaked with epinephrine or electric cauterization to control the wound bleeding.\n3. Canaloplasty\nRemove the medial side of the EAC skin and tympanic membrane.\n\t\nUnder the endoscope, use a round knife to elevate the EAC skin connected to the tympanic membrane.",
    "Use an alligator clamp to completely remove the skin and tympanic membrane.\n\t\tNOTE: Try not to retain any epithelium in the external ear canal or middle ear cavity to avoid possible risk of external ear and middle ear cholesteatoma postoperatively.\nWiden the ear canal transmeatally with a 2 mm diamond burr.\n\t\nUsing an endoscope with the four-hand technique, enlarge the diameter of the canal to directly visualize all of the middle ear cavity. The assistant holds the endoscope with two hands, and the surgeon can also perform the surgical procedure with two hands.\nOtherwise, under the microscope, use both hands of the surgeon to enlarge the diameter of the canal with a 2 mm cutting burr.\nUse a silicone sheet or cotton ball to separate the middle ear and external auditory canal in order to avoid getting bony chips or the epithelium of the canal into the middle ear cavity.\n4. Insertion of the endoscope and setting of the 3D imaging system\nHold a 3.0 mm endoscope with the left hand and insert it into the canal after the bleeding is well-controlled.\nPlace both monitors of the 2D and 3D images in front of the operative table. Click Open to open software.\n\tNOTE: The 2D and 3D monitors provide 2D and 3D images, respectively, from different machines.\nHave the surgeon and all observers wear stereoscopic glasses for 3D vision.\n\tNOTE: Real time 3D reconstruction of the endoscopic ear image is carried out throughout the surgery by the processor. There is simultaneous display of the 2D (shown on one monitor) and 3D (shown on the other one) images. With or without goggles, observers can compare the 2D and 3D images of the surgical field. Any change in brightness, sharpness and color, and time delay could be perceived.",
    "Use a 45° 3 mm endoscope to confirm that the residual skin of the external auditory canal and remnant of the eardrum have been completely removed to avoid possible cholesteatoma after the surgery.\nTo avoid heat injury, keep the light resource under 40% throughout the surgery, and frequently move the endoscope forward and backward in the canal.\nUse antifog solution to clear the endoscope if the endoscope lens is contaminated with blood.\n5. Approach to the inner ear and tumor resection\nCut the chorda tympani nerve with the scissors and remove the remnant chorda tympani nerve with the retrieval device (e.g. Alligator) and suction.\n\t\nRemove all the ossicular chain (malleus, incus and stapes).\nUnder the endoscope, carefully remove the incus, malleus and stapes by the retrieval device, respectively.\nCarefully preserve the function and the path of the facial nerve with a facial nerve monitor.\n\t\nUnder the endoscope, observe the facial nerve canal, and avoid touching or damaging the facial canal.\nRemove the outer portions of the basal and middle turn of the cochlea and some of the lateral wall of the modiolus to expose the tumor with a piezosurgery instrument.\n\tNOTE: Similar to the surgical procedure introduced by L. Presutti8, the vestibular schwannoma can be visible after entering the fundus of the IAC.\nRemove the tumor carefully.\n\t\nWhen the tumor is visible, separate the tumor from the facial nerve and the cochlear nerve and remove the tumor.\nSet a stimulus of 0.05-0.1 mA, and use the probe to touch the suspected tissue to result in a facial nerve response. Be careful not to use the suction tube to touch the nerve.\nPack the defect with abdominal fat and hemostatic agents (e.g. Surgicel and Floseal).",
    "Suture the lateral EAC skin flap to the tragal skin in a watertight fashion for cosmetic reasons.\n6. Post-operative procedure\nAdmit the patient postoperatively to the intensive care unit for 24-48 hours.\nTransfer the patient to general ward if no postoperative complications occur.\nSubscription Required.
