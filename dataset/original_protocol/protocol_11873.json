    "All animals used in this protocol were kept under standard husbandry conditions, and experiments have been performed according to the handling guidelines and regulations of EU and the Government of Upper Bavaria (AZ 55.2-1-54-2532-0916).\n1. Preparation of Plasmid Mixture for Electroporation\nDilute the plasmid of interest in sterile water and add fast green stain stock solution [1 mg/mL]. Make sure that the final concentration of the plasmid is  ∼1 µg/µL. Add the stain at a concentration of no more than 3%, as its only purpose is to color the solution and visualize ventricular injection.\nOnce prepared, mix the plasmid solution by pipetting up and down several times or by finger tapping. Store at room temperature (RT) until usage.\nNOTE: For co-electroporation of two plasmids into the same cell, ensure that the concentration of each individual plasmid used in the mixture is at least 0.8 ng/µL with a molar ratio of 1:1 to obtain 80%–90% co-electroporation efficiency.\n2. Preparations for Injection and Electroporation Procedure\nPrepare the glass capillaries (outer diameter 1 mm, inner diameter 0.58 mm) necessary for the injection in the needle pulling apparatus.\nIn order to inject the correct amount of plasmid (see above), pull the capillary at a temperature of 68.5 °C with two light and two heavy weights (see Table of Materials for puller specifications).\nNOTE: In case a different puller is used, calibrate the capillary to deliver the appropriate volume of electroporation mix.\nManually set the injection device to an injection pressure of 200 hPa (by turning the Pi knob) and constant pressure of 0 hPa. Manually set the injection time to manual mode and control the pressure with foot pedal.",
    "Set the electroporation device to “LV mode” with five pulses at 54–57 V (25 ms each with 1 s intervals). Connect the electrodes to the device.\nPrepare one fish tank with clean fish water, where the fish will be awakened from anesthesia after the electroporation procedure. Aerate the water by keeping the air stone attached to the air pump for the entire recovery period until the fish is fully awakened.\nTake a regular kitchen sponge and make a longitudinal cut in the sponge to hold fish into during the injection and electroporation procedure (see previous publication3).\nNOTE: The kitchen sponge should be regularly washed or exchanged in order to remove potential toxic chemicals.\nPlace a small amount of highly conductive multi-purpose ultrasound gel next to the injection and electroporation setup.\nNOTE: This will ensure adequate electrical conductivity, and consequently, distribution of electroporated cells throughout the entire telencephalon.\n3. Zebrafish Anesthesia\nPrior to anesthetization, prepare a stock solution of anesthesia with 0.2% MS222 in distilled water and adjust the pH to 7 with Tris-HCl buffer. Dilute this stock 1:10 (i.e., to 0.02% MS222) using fish water.\nAnesthetize the fish by keeping them in this working solution until the movement of the body and gills subsides (typically for a couple of minutes).\n4. Plasmid Solution Injection\nFill the prepared glass capillary with 10 µL of plasmid solution using microloader tips. Avoid the formation of air bubbles inside the capillary.\nPress Menu/Change Capillary on the injection device. Insert and secure the needle into the needle holder.",
    "Under a stereomicroscope with a magnification of 3.2x or 4x, cut only the tip of the capillary using fine-end forceps. Switch the injection device from Change Capillary mode into Inject mode, then apply pressure with a foot pedal to ensure that the plasmid solution is running easily out of the needle and without hindrance.\nTransfer the fish from the husbandry tank to the container (plastic box) with anesthetic solution. Wait for a few minutes until movement of the gills subsides.\nPlace fish into the pre-wetted sponge with the dorsal side facing up. Perform all the following injection steps under the stereomicroscope to ensure the accuracy of procedure.\nUsing a dissecting micro-knife from stainless steel with 40 mm cutting edge and 0.5 mm thickness, create a small hole in the fish skull at the posterior side of the telencephalon (Figure 1B), just next to the border with optic tectum.\nNOTE: This step should be performed carefully since the hole should be very small and superficial, penetrating solely the skull, to avoid brain damage.\nTilt the fish as necessary and orient the tip of the glass capillary towards the skull in the correct angle to facilitate penetration of the capillary tip through the hole.\nInsert the tip of the capillary through the hole in the skull carefully until it reaches the telencephalic ventricle (see Figure 1B). This will require penetration through the dorsal ependymal cell layer. Be especially careful not to insert the capillary too deeply to avoid contact with the brain tissue. Keep the capillary precisely in between the hemispheres, remaining inside the ventricle just after piercing the dorsal ependymal layer.\nNOTE: This is a very delicate step. Accuracy of this procedure is improved using pigmentation mutant lines such as brassy24, allowing better visualization of glass capillary position during injection.",
    "With the capillary tip inside of the ventricle, inject the plasmid solution by applying pressure with the foot pedal for about 10 s, which corresponds to approximately 1 µL of plasmid solution.\nNOTE: If changing the needle puller, capillaries or injector, the system should be calibrated in order to always deliver 1 µL of plasmid solution. Calibration can be performed by measuring the diameter of the plasmid droplet expelled into a mineral oil (e.g., paraffin oil) and subsequently calculating the volume of the droplet. After 10 s of injection, there should be ~1 µL of plasmid liquid expelled into the mineral oil.\nConfirm success of the previous step by observing the spread of liquid throughout the ventricle.\n5. Electroporation\nRemove the fish from the injection set-up while still holding it in the sponge.\nImmerse the inner side of the tip of the electrodes in the ultrasound gel.\nCover the fish telencephalon with a small amount of ultrasound gel.\nPosition the fish head between the electrodes, placing the positive electrode at the ventral side of the fish’s head and the negative electrode on the dorsal side (Figure 1C), while still holding the fish’s body in the sponge. This sets the direction of the flow of the current necessary to electroporate ependymoglia positioned at subventricular zone.\nPress the electrodes gently and precisely against the telencephalon (Figure 1C). Administer the current with the foot pedal. Hold the electrodes in place until all five pulses are finished.\n6. Fish Recovery\nLet the fish recover in the previously prepared, continuously aerated tank until it wakes up. Lidocaine gel could be applied on the skull in order to relieve any possibly developed pain.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
