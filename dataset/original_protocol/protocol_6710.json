    "Preparation of C. elegans strainsTransfer four adult animals expressing GCaMP and mCherry from the cultivation plate to a new NGM+OP50 plate using a platinum worm picker under fluorescent dissection microscopy guidance.Keep the new plate at 19.5 °C for 8 h and then remove the four adult animals transferred in Step A1.Incubate the new plate at 19.5°C for 65-70 h until the start of the calcium imaging experiment. In these conditions, ~100 synchronized young adult animals will be grown with a few eggs laid on the plate per animal at the beginning of the experiment.Note: Because some transgenic strains lay fewer eggs than wild-type animals, the number of such transgenic animals transferred to the new plate can be increased to obtain ~100 animals per plate. Fine temperature adjustment is required for robust 2-nonanone response, although this may not be the case for other odor stimuli. Creation of 2-nonanone gas and a calibration curve for odor measurement using the vaporizing tankTurn on the semiconductor odor sensor at least 30 min before use.Add 70 μl of 2-nonanone into a 1.5-ml regular laboratory tube.Measure the baseline (i.e., room air) voltage level of the semiconductor odor sensor by withdrawing the room air to the sensor with a plastic syringe A8450 (Henke) set on the syringe pump at 8 ml/min for 450 s (Figure 6C, top panel).Make 6.13 μM 2-nonanone gas in the vaporizing tank while acquiring a data set for a calibration curve on the experimental day by the following steps.Put 4.45 μl of 2-nonanone from the aliquot in the groove of the heating metal block in the vaporizing tank using a 5-μl micro-volume syringe (SGE). Immediately start measuring the time-course of 2-nonanone vaporization in the tank.",
    "Withdraw the gas inside the tank to the odor sensor with the same equipment as that in Step B3 at 8 ml/min and record the voltage output from the sensor for 5 min (Figure 6C, middle panel). Confirm that the time-course of the voltage plateaued after 4 min and adopt the voltage at 5 min for the concentration of 0.51 μM (approximately 25.6 μmol of 2-nonanone added to the 50-L tank). After taking the measurement, stop the syringe pump and discard the gas inside the plastic syringe to prepare for the next measurement.Add another 4.45 μl of 2-nonanone to the vaporizing tank and measure the time-course of its vaporization for another 5 min. Adopt the voltage at 5 min for the concentration of 1.02 μM.Add 8.9 μl of 2-nonanone to the vaporizing tank using a 50-μl microliter syringe (Hamilton) and measure the time-course of its vaporization for 8 min. Adopt the voltage at 8 min for the concentration of 2.04 μM.Add 17.8 μl of 2-nonanone to the vaporizing tank and measure the time-course of its vaporization for 13 min. Adopt the voltage at 13 min for the concentration of 4.09 μM.Add 17.8 μl of 2-nonanone to the vaporizing tank. A total of 53.3 μl of 2-nonanone is evaporated in the tank, producing 6.13 μM 2-nonanone gas.Turn off the semiconductor odor sensor.Create a calibration curve to calculate the concentration from the measured voltage output. Subtract the baseline voltage value (final timepoint from Step B3) from the measured voltage values for 0.51, 1.02, 2.04, and 4.09 μM (from Step B4) to obtain four data points (x, y) = (voltage, concentration) for each concentration. Then, fit the four data points by the power approximation and determine parameters a, b of the calibration curve y = axb (Figure 6B).",
    "The calibration curve will be used to calculate concentration change y(t) from the measured voltage x(t) in the following experiment. Create a calibration curve each experimental day because the parameters a and b gradually change due to the characteristic of the semiconductor sensor.Preparation of open agar platesPrepare NGM with 2.5% agar on each day of the experiment. Dissolve the compounds (Recipe section) in a microwave oven. No need for sterilized handling.Keep the medium and the custom-made polycarbonate dishes at 60 °C for about 1 h.Bring the medium and dishes on the bench and keep the medium on a warming magnetic stirrer to retain medium-low viscosity.Quickly pour 10 ml of the medium into the dish using a 5-ml Pipetman P5000 (Gilson) before the pre-warmed dish cools to room temperature. Prepare one agar plate for one trial planned on the experimental day. Be careful not to create any bumps or dents on the agar surface that may disturb the imaging.Cover four plates on the bench with a lid of a 34 cm × 24 cm plastic case 2321E (Sanplatec) to avoid dust and excessive dryness (Figure 8A).After 15 min, move the agar plates to the 34 cm × 24 cm plastic case. Close its lid and store it at room temperature (Figure 8B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3866/bioprotoc-11-01-3866-g008.jpgFigure 8. Creating the open agar plates. A. Four open agar plates covered by the lid of a 34 cm × 24 cm plastic case 2321E (Sanplatec) on the bench. B. Four open agar plates stored in the 34 cm × 24 cm plastic case with its lid closed.Preparation of NGM buffer for washing the wormsMake 1 ml aliquots of NGM buffer solution without agar before adding CaCl2, MgSO4, and KPO4 buffer and store them at -25 °C before the experiment.",
    "Defrost one of the aliquots and add CaCl2, MgSO4 and KPO4 buffer to prepare 1 ml NGM buffer without agar on each day of the experiment. For the experiment with immobilized animals, add 25 μl of 200 mM levamisole as an anesthetic to make 1 ml NGM buffer with 5 mM levamisole.Confirmation of odor concentration in the vaporizing tankTurn on the semiconductor odor sensor again at least 30 min before use.Two hours after Step B4, the 2-nonanone concentration in the tank will become relatively stable; during the 2-h period, 2-nonanone adsorbs to the tank wall and its concentration decreases relatively rapidly. Measure the concentration inside the tank again using the same procedure as in Step B4 (Figure 6C, middle panel). Adopt the voltage at 2 min for the concentration in the tank.Calculate the 2-nonanone concentration inside the tank using the calibration curve obtained in Step B6. The concentration is expected to decrease from the original 6.13 μM to around 4 μM due to the adsorption of 2-nonanone to the tank.Daily confirmation of the temporal odor gradient before the experimentDepending on the design of the temporal odor gradient, fill one or two 25-ml Gastight syringes (Hamilton) with the 2-nonanone gas from the vaporizing tank at least 30 min before use to make the 2-nonanone adsorb to the syringe. To withdraw the gas from the tank, attach a Luer-lock side-hole needle 23 G × 4 cm ( 3008-46004  , GL Sciences) to the syringe and insert the needle into a rubber plug on the tank’s lid. Mark each syringe “2-nonanone syringe” and exclusively use it to transport 2-nonanone. Prepare two or three “air syringes” and exclusively use them to transport room air.After 30 min, discard the gas from the 2-nonanone syringe(s) in Step F1.",
    "Fill the 2-nonanone syringe(s) with the odor gas from the vaporizing tank again and set it on a syringe pump HV-SSP01 (HawkVision) for 2-nonanone. When only one 2-nonanone syringe is used, set an air syringe filled with room air on the other holder of the syringe pump for 2-nonanone.Set two air syringes filled with room air on another syringe pump HV-SSP01 for air.Connect the four Luer-lock basements of the custom-made microchannel to the 2-nonanone and air syringes (Figure 2).Connect the semiconductor odor sensor to the end of the microchannel (Figure 6C, bottom panel).Start measurements by the odor sensor and simultaneously start moving the two syringe pumps according to the predesigned temporal gradient.Repeat Steps F2-F6 twice more and calculate the temporal odor concentration changes using the calibration curve obtained in Step B6. Check if the measured temporal odor gradient is as expected and stable for the three measurements.Setting the tube end positionDisconnect the semiconductor odor sensor from the end of the custom-made microchannel. Instead, connect the end of the microchannel to the tube end attached to the bamboo skewer and the micro manipulator MF-1 (S Company).Place an agar plate on the stage and slide it under the objective lens.Change the objective lens from 20× UPLFLN to 10× UPLSAPO and use the binocular eyepieces to focus on the surface of the agar plate.Move the tube end of the microchannel toward the position shown in Figure 9 using the XY-adjusting screws of the micro manipulator.Using the Z-adjusting screw of the micro manipulator, lower the tube end until it touches the surface of the agar plate.Slightly raise the tube end to prevent scratching the surface of the agar plate.Return the objective lens from 10× UPLSAPO to 20× UPLFLN.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3866/bioprotoc-11-01-3866-g009.jpgFigure 9. Adjusting the position of the tube end. A.",
    "Positional relationship between the tube end and a worm in the view field of the binocular eyepieces. B. A schematic of the positional relationship between the tube end and the worm.Calcium imaging experimentFill the 2-nonanone syringe(s) with the odor gas from the vaporizing tank and set it on the syringe pump HV-SSP01 for 2-nonanone.Fill the air syringes with room air and set them on the other syringe pump for air. When only one 2-nonanone syringe is used, set an air syringe on the syringe pump for 2-nonanone as well.Connect the four Luer-lock basements of the custom-made microchannel to the 2-nonanone and air syringes (Figure 2).Put two droplets of the NGM buffer (10 μl each) on a Petri dish.Using a platinum worm picker, pick up a young adult worm expressing GCaMP and mCherry from the cultivation plate prepared in Step A3 and transfer it to one of the NGM buffer droplets under fluorescent dissection microscopy. For the experiment with immobilized animals, multiple (4-10) animals can be transferred.Keep the worm in the NGM buffer droplet for 1 min to wash bacterial food from the worm.Transfer the worm to the other droplet and keep it there for another 1 min for washing.Transfer the worm to the center of a new open agar plate. For the experiment with immobilized animals, place multiple immobilized worms side-by-side.Put the agar plate on the stage and slide it under the objective lens. Reset the position of the tube end according to Steps G3 to G7.Identify the worm(s) under the microscope by moving the stage. Position the worm(s) at the center of the view field and then start the odor delivery and calcium imaging (and tracking if necessary) simultaneously.After the program of the temporal odor gradient is completed, stop recording the fluorescent images.",
    "Remove the agar plate from the stage.Repeat Steps H1 to H11 to increase the sample number or test other experimental conditions.Daily confirmation of the temporal odor gradient after the experimentTurn on the semiconductor odor sensor at least 30 min before use.Fill the 2-nonanone syringe(s) with the odor gas from the vaporizing tank and set it on the syringe pump for 2-nonanone.Fill the air syringes with the room air and set them on the other syringe pump for air. When only one 2-nonanone syringe is used, set an air syringe on the syringe pump for 2-nonanone as well.Connect the four Luer-lock basements of the custom-made microchannel to the 2-nonanone and air syringes.Disconnect the tube end from the end of the custom-made microchannel. Instead, connect the semiconductor odor sensor to the end of the microchannel.Start the odor sensor measurements and simultaneously start moving the two syringe pumps according to the temporal odor gradient used on the experimental day.Calculate the temporal odor concentration changes by the calibration curve obtained in Step B6. Check if the measured temporal odor gradient is similar to the ones obtained in Step F7.Cleaning of the vaporizing tankAfter use, open the lid of the vaporizing tank in a fume hood and keep ventilating the odor gas for at least 30 min.Wipe the inside wall of the tank with tissue paper soaked with 70% ethanol to clean up the adsorbed 2-nonanone in the tank.Ventilate the tank in the fume hood with the lid open again for at least 30 min.After cleaning the tank, store it with the lid open until its next use."
