    "This protocol describes the pulse labeling of DNA and harvesting of the labeled human PSC intended for use in the DNA fiber assay. Human PSC should be seeded at least 48 hr before starting the experiment. Pulse labeling is performed sequentially with two thymidine analogs—chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU) and iododeoxyuridine (IdU)—for 20 min each (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]). DNA labeling exploits the ability of in vitro−cultured cells to incorporate nucleotide analogs into newly replicating DNA strands. To ensure consistent and robust labeling, the cells should be at ∼50% confluency at the start of the experiment: this will ensure the cells are still in the growth phase and replication is not suppressed. Further, the labeling time should be strictly monitored. A deviation in timing will introduce inaccuracy and confound experimental results. Once labeled, the cells should be dissociated into single cells using TrypLE, to minimize stress and allow for accurate cell counting. Dissociated cells should be kept on ice to inhibit further enzymatic activity before spreading (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0002]).\nThis protocol should produce a homogenous single-cell suspension of pulse-labeled cells in ice-cold PBS for DNA spreading (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0002]).\nMaterials\n1× PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0003])\nHuman PSC culture medium: mTeSR 1 (STEMCELL Technologies, 85850), E8 (in house; Chen et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-bib-0007]), or Nutristem XF (Biological Industries, 05-100-1A)\nRho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 inhibitor (Y-27632; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0009])\nOne T-12.5 flask of human embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells\nTrypLE Express single-cell dissociation solution (Life Technologies, 12604-021)\n2.5 mM 5-chloro-2′-deoxyuridine (CldU) stock solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0005])\n2.5 mM 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IdU stock solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0005])\nIce cold 1× Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0003])\nVitronectin-coated 6-well plate (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0011])\n15-ml conical centrifuge tubes (Falcon or equivalent)\nCell counter\nCentrifuge\nSeed human PSC for DNA labeling",
    "1. Add 2 ml of human PSC culture medium, supplemented with Y-27632 (1:1000), to each well of a vitronectin-coated 6-well plate. Pre-warm the plate for 30 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator to allow the vitronectin to set.\n2. Aspirate the cell culture medium from the T-12.5 flask of human PSC.\n3. Add 1 ml TrypLE to the T-12.5 flask and incubate for 3 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\n4. Add 4 ml of human PSC culture medium to the T-12.5 flask to detach the cells. Transfer the cell suspension into a 15-ml tube.\n5. Count the total cell number and centrifuge the cells 3 min at 300 × g, room temperature, then resuspend the pellet in 1 ml human PSC culture medium.\n6. Seed 80,000 cells per well of the 6-well plate prepared in step 1. Culture for 72 hr (minimum of 48 hr, although cell numbers will need to be adjusted accordingly) with daily batch feeding, removing the Y-27632 after 24 hr.\nDNA pulse labeling\n7. Prewarm CldU and IdU stock solutions to 37°C.\n8. Prewarm TrypLE solution to 37°C.\n9. Add CldU stock solution to the seeded cells (from step 1-6) for a final concentration of 25 μM (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\n10. Incubate for precisely 20 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\n11. Add IdU stock solution to the seeded cells for a final concentration of 250 μM (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\nThe concentration of IdU is 10-fold higher than the concentration of CldU. This is to ensure that IdU displaces CldU during the second pulse-labeling step. The addition of the second analog must be performed promptly following the 20-min incubation with the first analog.\n12. Incubate for precisely 20 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\n13. Aspirate the medium.",
    "14. Wash twice, each time with 2 ml ice-cold PBS, aspirating medium after each wash.\nSteps 13 to 14 should be performed rapidly to avoid over-labeling of nascent DNA.\n15. Add 1 ml pre-warmed TrypLE solution to each well. Coat the wells thoroughly and aspirate off the excess solution.\n16. Incubate for 3 min.\n17. Aspirate off the excess TrypLE and add 0.5 ml ice-cold PBS to release the cells from the 6-well plate. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15-ml conical tube.\n18. Count the total cell number and dilute with ice-cold PBS to 400,000 cells per ml.\n19. Keep on ice and spread (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0002]) within 30 min.",
    "This protocol aims to describe the technique of DNA spreading (Parra & Windle, 1993[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-bib-0021]). Following DNA labeling (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0001]), a small droplet of cell suspension is lysed on a glass slide (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]) and then tilted to allow spreading. The droplet of cell lysate solution generates cohesive tension with the slide as it runs its length, stretching the DNA into fibers that can be later stained and visualized by immunofluorescence (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0003] and Support Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0004]).\nThe major factor requiring optimization in this protocol is the type of glass slide used. Before initiating this protocol, different brands and batches of slides should be tested to ensure the droplet runs slowly down the length of the glass slide when tilted at 25°-40°. If this protocol is conducted properly, a droplet of cell lysate solution should run the length of a glass slide in 3 to 5 min. Once dried, the path of the droplet should leave behind a cloudy precipitate. Depending on the temperature and humidity, it may be necessary to alter the volume of the spreading buffer or the angle at which the slide is tilted to ensure that the droplet runs at a slow, constant rate.\nMaterials\nCell suspension (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0001])\nSpreading buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0010])\nMethanol/acetic acid fixative (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0006])\nSuper premium microscope slides (BDH Laboratory Supplies)\nOther slides are also suitable, although each batch should be tested to optimize spreading.\nThe lid of a multi-well plate (or something similar) to hold the tilted slides in place\nCell lysis\n1. Working with one sample at a time, pipette 2 μl of ice-cold cell suspension at the top of each of 3-5 microscope slides, depending on the number of replicates to be performed (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).",
    "Be sure that the droplet does not touch the frosted end of the slide, as this will inhibit its ability to spread. It is a good idea to mark with pencil the position of the cell suspension, to aid in finding the fibers on the microscope.\n2. Allow to dry for 5-7 min.\nThis step will require optimization. Look for the edges of the droplet beginning to dry and for the droplet to become tacky. The time that this takes may vary depending on room temperature and humidity. However, do not allow the droplet to completely dry.\n3. Add ∼7 μl of spreading buffer and stir with a pipette tip (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\nTo ensure that the droplet spreads down the slide slowly (step 5 to 6), the volume of spreading buffer may need to be adjusted.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Stir with the pipette tip; do NOT pipette up and down.\n4. Incubate for 2 min.\nSpreading\n5. Tilt each slide at an angle of 25° to 40° and hold in place on the lid of a multi-well plate.\n6. Let the droplet run down the slide slowly and at a constant speed. The droplet should reach the bottom edge after 3 to 5 min (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\nIt is important to ensure that the droplet spreads slowly and at a constant speed, so that the fibers do not clump and become uncountable during the analysis steps.\n7. Lay the slides flat and allow to air dry completely (approximately 15 min).\n8. Go back to step 1 and prepare the next sample.\nFixation\n9. Using a 1-ml pipette, gently add 1 ml methanol/acetic acid fixative to the bottom right-hand corner of the slide and allow it to spread over the entirety of the slide (Fig. 1D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\n10. Incubate for 10 min.",
    "11. Tilt the slide to allow the excess fixative to run off, and allow to air dry completely.\nAt this point, the slides can be stored at 4°C overnight.",
    "This protocol describes the immunolabeling of DNA fibers spread onto glass slides. The protocol begins with an acid treatment to denature the DNA fibers before blocking for unspecific binding and labeling the CldU and IdU labeled fibers with rat and mouse anti-BrdU primary antibodies, respectively. Detection of the labeled DNA fibers is possible by immunostaining with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Fig. 1E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0001]).\nFollowing this immunostaining protocol, it will be possible to detect the labeled DNA fibers by confocal microscopy. The labeled DNA should be detectable as bi-labeled fibers in the 555 and 488 Alexa Fluor visible spectrum. Further details and expected results from this protocol can be found in the “Understanding Results” section.\nMaterials\nSlides with spread DNA fibers (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0002])\n2.5 M hydrochloric acid (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0004])\n1× PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0003])\nBlocking solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0001]), pre-chilled\nRat monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody [BU1/75 (ICR1)] (Abcam, ab6326)\nMouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (clone B44) (Becton Dickson, 347580 (7580))\n4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-rec-0007])\nAlexa Fluor 555 goat anti−rat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21434)\nAlexa Fluor 488 F (ab′)2 goat anti−mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11017)\nFluoroshield mounting medium (Sigma, F6182)\nGlass staining troughs with slide racks (e.g., Sigma, BR472200)\nCoplin staining jar (e.g., Sigma, S5766)\nCoverslips, 60 × 22 mm (ThermoFisher Scientific, BB02200600A113MNT0)\nWash, denature, and block\n1.

Make a fresh solution of primary antibodies by mixing rat monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:500) and mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:500) in blocking solution.\nAntibodies should be titered, as the optimal concentration will depend on the source and nature of the antibody.\n8. Using a 1-ml pipette, gently add 750 μl of the antibody solution to the bottom right-hand corner of the slide and allow it to spread over the entirety of the slide.\nTo stop the solution from evaporating, this step should be performed on a damp paper towel covered with a plastic lid.

    "In support of the basic protocols above, we provide microscopy parameters and data-acquisition instructions to facilitate accurate data analysis (Support Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-prot-0005]). It is important to take pictures of fibers from across the entire slide where fibers do not overlap, in order to ensure that robust measurements will be obtained.

In particular, we will describe how to measure DNA fiber length, replication fork speed, fork symmetry, and inter-replication origin distance, and how to detect and quantify different replication events.\nIn each case, a total of 150-200 fibers should be analyzed per condition for a reliable estimation of fiber length, and to account for the range of fiber lengths that can be attributed to the varied dynamics of replication forks. Only clear fibers that do not overlap should be included (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.115#cpsc115-fig-0002]). It is also important to image fibers from across the entire slide to ensure robust measurement of replication fork dynamics. Data should be plotted as scatter dot plots, or in box-and-whiskers plots. Statistical significance between two groups is normally assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test (unpaired and nonparametric).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f91a62aa-ac91-4364-826e-68b0193a83eb/cpsc115-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nRepresentative image showing a single field of DNA fibers.

The fibers within the field show minimal overlap and can be easily measured. Analysis of fields with a high density of DNA fibers can confound measurements, as they are likely to overlap, hindering their measurement from end-to-end.

Analysis of these forks can be used to determine the fiber length and replication fork speed using the formulae shown. (B) Example of a bi-directional replication fork. Analysis of these fibers allows for the quantification of fork symmetry; loss of symmetry indicates that replication fork stalling has occurred.
