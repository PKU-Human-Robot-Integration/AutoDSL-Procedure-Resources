Flow chart of key steps in protocol.Notice that purified phosphatase after step B and mounted tissues after step F can be stored frozen, constituting possible breakpoints in the procedure.S2 cell transfection Note: All steps should be done in a biosafety cabinet. Prepare S2 cell media + 10% FBS (see Recipe 1).Revive S2 cells following DGRC instructions, available at https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/include/file/general_maintenance.pdf[href=https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/include/file/general_maintenance.pdf].Maintain cells in a 25 °C incubator at a density between 2 × 106 and 1 × 107 (6 mL final volume) in a 25 cm2 flask.Transfect and harvest S2 cells using the following 5-day protocol.Day 1: Passage cells into a new 25 cm2 flask.Day 2: Count the cells that were passaged on day 1.Determine cell density using CountessTM automated cell counter.Plate 2 × 106 cells per well of a six-well plate in 2.5 mL final volume.Day 3: Transfect S2 cells.Warm transIT-2020 reagent to room temperature and vortex gently.Pipette 250 µL of serum-free Schneider’s Drosophila medium into a microfuge tube.Pipette 2.5 µg of DNA of phosphatase expression plasmid (pPuro-MT-Nil-Twin-streptag) to media in step b and mix gently.Pipette 7.5 µL of TransIT-2020 into the DNA/media mixture and mix gently.Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Pipette transfection mixture dropwise to cells plated on day 2 and cover entire well.Swirl plate gently to mix.Place six-well plate in 25 °C incubator.Select for transfected cells using puromycin (optional).Allow transfected cells to recover for 48 h.Prepare a 10 mg/mL puromycin solution in water.Transfer cells from six-well plate to a 25 cm2 flask; add S2 cell media up to a final volume of 6 mL.Allow cells to grow until confluent.Remove S2 cell media and floating cells and transfer to new 25 cm2 flask.Allow cells to grow to reach confluency.Keep as a backup if the first selection fails.",
    "Begin selection of confluent cells by adding 6 mL of fresh S2 cell media + puromycin [10 µg/mL final concentration (see Recipe 3)].Remove S2 media every two days and add fresh S2 cell media + 10 µg/mL puromycin.Be sure to remove all floating debris.Monitor cell death daily using inverted microscope.Continue selection with 10 µg/mL puromycin until 90%–95% of cells are dead.Add fresh S2 cell media + 2 µg/mL puromycin to the few remaining cells and allow the transfected cells to grow until confluent. This may take 2–3 weeks. Maintain selected cells at normal density with 2 µg/mL puromycin after selection is complete.Plate 2.5 × 106 cells (2.5 mL) per well in a six-well plate to be induced.Day 4: Induce phosphatase expression from pMT plasmid for 24 h. Pipette 2.5 µL of a 0.7 M CuSO4 solution (see Recipe 4) to each well with transfected cells.Day 5: Harvest cells after 24 h of induction.Dislodge cells by pipetting the medium up and down.Transfer cell suspension to a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube.Centrifuge 5 min at 1,000 × g at room temperature.Remove supernatant.Wash cells by suspending in 1 mL of 1× PBS (see Recipe 2).Transfer cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microfuge tube.Centrifuge 5 min at 1,000 × g at room temperature.Remove supernatant.Freeze cells at -80 °C or proceed to protein purification.Nil protein purification Prepare lysis buffer (see Recipe 5).Add 1 mL of lysis buffer to cell pellet and suspend cells by pipetting up and down.Incubate cells/lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation.Centrifuge homogenate at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min.Wash 20 µL MagStrep “type3” XT magnetic beads three times with lysis buffer.Transfer lysate to washed beads.Incubate beads/lysate for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation.Prepare biotin elution buffer (see Recipe 7). Warm to 37 °C.",
    "Wash beads three times with 500 µL lysis buffer.Add 25 µL of biotin elution buffer to beads.Incubate 10 min with occasional mixing/vortexing.Remove beads from eluate using magnetic microfuge tube rack.Aliquot eluate containing phosphatase (5 µL each) and store at -20 °C.Quantify phosphatase concentration.Mix 10 µL of eluates with 10 µL of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and DTT to 0.1 M.Prepare serial dilutions of BSA in 20 µL of 1× Laemmli sample buffer ranging from 1 µg–0.1 ng. Include DTT to 0.1 M.Boil samples for 3 min at 100 °C.Load eluate samples and BSA dilution series samples on a 10% protein gel.Run gel for 1 h at 150 V in electrophoresis chamber.Transfer protein contents from gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane using blotting system.Stain membrane with a total protein stain.Image membrane with a Western blot scanner.Use software associated with Western blot scanner to quantify BSA and eluate bands.Determine eluate protein concentration by comparing quantification of band of interest to those of BSA serial dilutions.In situ dephosphorylation assay  Dissect third instar larvae in 300 µL of ice-cold 1× PBS (see Recipe 2) under a dissecting microscope on a silicone dish. Gently hold the larva at the middle with forceps and firmly hold the larval mouth hooks with other forceps. Then, pull the mouth parts away from the rest of the body to get a single mass of brain with attached eye-antennal imaginal discs and salivary glands, as well as other tissues (larval carcass). For a comprehensive description of such dissection see the video in Hsiao et al. (2012).Fix 10–15 larval carcasses in a 200 µL drop of periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde for 20 min on the same silicone dish (at room temperature; no shaking required) (see Recipe 12 for fixative preparation).",
    "Transfer fixed larval carcasses in a well of a 96-well plate with 200 µL of PBS and wash for 10 min with gentle rotation on an orbital shaker.For each of the following washes and incubations, gently use forceps to move carcasses into the next well on the 96-well plate with the indicated solution, and then incubate on an orbital shaker with gentle rotation unless otherwise specified.Wash two times in 200 µL of 1× PBS for 10 min (see Recipe 2).Permeabilize larval carcasses in 200 µL of PBSS (PBS + 0.3% saponin) for 10 min.Repeat the previous step one more time.Wash fixed and permeabilized tissues twice in 200 µL of 1× PBS for 10 min.Treat larval carcasses with 50 ng of wild-type Nil phosphatase without or with 100 µM CdCl2 or with 50 ng of the inactive NilD231N phosphatase in 100 µL of phosphatase assay buffer (see Recipe 15), for 3 h in 37 °C incubator. Nil, like other metal-dependent phosphatases, including its human homologs PPM1A/B, is potently inhibited by cadmium (Kamada et al., 2020; Nandi et al., 2022).Wash phosphatase-treated larval carcasses three times in 200 µL of 1× PBS for 10 min.To block unspecific antibody binding, incubate larval carcasses in PBSS + 5% normal goat serum for 30 min.Stain blocked larval carcasses with primary antibody (phospho-specific antibody for pS437-acinus raised in rabbit, 1:1,000) in 200 µL of PBSS + 5% normal goat serum overnight at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Cover wells with parafilm for overnight incubation.Wash antibody-stained tissues four times in PBSS for 10 min to remove unbound primary antibody.Stain blocked larval carcasses with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) cross-adsorbed secondary antibody (1:500) in PBSS + 10% normal goat serum for 3 h in the dark at room temperature.",
    "Note: Protect specimen from unnecessary light exposure during and after secondary antibody staining with aluminum foil. Wash secondary antibody–stained tissues four times in PBSS for 10 min to remove unbound secondary antibody.Add a small drop of Vectashield with DAPI to a microscope slide. Mount eye discs from the stained larval carcasses in that Vectashield with DAPI. DAPI stains the nuclei.Slowly lower the coverslip onto the drop of Vectashield in which eye discs are mounted. Take care to minimize air bubbles.Seal the edges of the coverslip to the slide with clear nail polish.Store slides in the dark at -20 °C until imaging.Image eye discs on a confocal microscope with a 63× objective for pS437-Acn staining. Acquire Confocal Z-stacks at 1 µm step size using Zen software."
