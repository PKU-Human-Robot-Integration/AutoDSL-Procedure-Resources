    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMicrosome preparation from cells\nTiming: 3 h\nTiming: for Step 7: 1–2 min per sample\nThe following protocol is for producing microsomes from monolayer SV589 cells.These cells are seeded at 4 × 105 cells per 6-cm dish and cultured for 2 days before harvesting. TM4SF20, the protein of interest, was transiently expressed via plasmid transfection. Alternatively, 90% confluent cells grown in a 15-cm dish can also be harvested to produce the same result as stated in Step 4.\nOptional: Transfection of expression vectors for the protein of interest: For TM4SF20, we use SV589 cells seeded in 6-cm dishes as above for transfection. One day after seeding, for each dish, 0.1 μg pCMV-TM4SF20-Myc expression vector with 1.9 μg empty vector is transfected with 3 μL Roche X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent following manufacturer’s instruction (PDF[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/234/408/xtghp-ro.pdf]). This approach yields at least 50% transfection efficiency. We harvest the cells 16 h post transfection.\nWhen cells expressing the protein of interest reach the density indicated above, they are harvested and broken by mechanical force. The microsome fraction is collected by ultracentrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatant.\nThaw Buffer T and add the protease inhibitor tablet to 1×. Keep Buffer T and PBS at 4°C or on ice. Prepare the collection tubes (15-mL tube) for harvest of the cells.\nAt room temperature (22°C), aspirate the media from cultured cells and rinse the cells with ice-cold PBS in the culture dishes.\nAspirate the PBS and add 1.5 mL (per 6-cm dish) or 10 mL (per 15-cm dish) PBS to the dishes.\nScrape the cells from the dishes in PBS with plastic cell lifters.\nFor each microsome sample, combine the cell suspension from three 6-cm dishes or one 15-cm dish into one 15-mL collection tube.",
    "After this step, the collection tubes are kept on ice throughout the experiment.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 1,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells. Aspirate the supernatant.\nNote: Cell pellet is usually visible at the bottom of the tubes.\nAdd 600 μL Buffer T to the cell pellet.\nBreak the cells in Buffer T by passing through a 22-Guage needle for 25 times.\nAssemble the 22-Guage needle with 1 mL syringe.\nIn the first cycle, draw the cell pellet together with the buffer and blow to disperse the suspension. Repeat the draw-blow cycle for 25 times.\nCritical: Now that the cells are broken, it is critical to keep the samples on ice or at 4°C to minimize degradation and undesired reactions.\nNote: Sharp needles. Use proper personal protective equipment.\nCentrifuge the homogenate at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet the heavy membrane fractions, mostly the nucleus.\nNote: The supernatant should be clear without white particles. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nTransfer 540 μL of the supernatant (post-nuclear supernatant) to a 2-mL ultracentrifuge tube.\nUltracentrifuge the post-nuclear supernatant at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to pellet the microsomes. Carefully remove the supernatant.\nNote: Microsome pellets are usually a visible thin layer. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nResuspend the microsome pellet with 100 μL Buffer T by pipetting with 200 μL tips.\nNote: Volume can be adjusted as desired. For one 15-cm dish of cells, 150–200 μL Buffer T is usually used.\nNote: Usually, 10‒20 times of pipetting are needed to disperse visible membrane particles in the buffer. The resulting suspension should be partially opaque without visible membrane particles. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nMove the resuspended microsomes to another tube (1.5 mL Eppendorf tube) for easier handling.",
    "Note: Ultracentrifuge tubes are usually round-bottom and without caps, making it at risk of spilling or rolling on ice.\nPause point: Resuspended microsomes can be left on ice for a few hours, although we recommend immediately advancing to the next steps of experiment. We have not tested if it could be stored longer or flash frozen.\nPNGase F accessibility assay\nTiming: 1.5 h (for steps 13 to 19)\nAfter obtaining the microsomes, this section will describe the setup of the PNGase F accessibility assay.\nDilute the PNGase F by 1:4 with buffer T for easier handling. The amount of PNGase F can be calculated from the Assay assembly chart below.\nFor each microsome sample, assemble four reaction conditions in reaction tubes on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2892_3.csv\nNote: It is convenient to perform these reactions in strip tubes or plates with thermocyclers as used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nIncubate the reactions at 30°C for 45 min, then cool down to 4°C or on ice for ∼5 min.\nPreheat the sample buffer for denaturation.\nDispense 20 μL of 2× Sample Buffer in a tube/well per reaction in the previous step.\nWhen the reaction in Step 15 is about to finish, preheat the sample buffer to 95°C.\nNote: Step 16 was implemented to prevent undesired PNGase F activity after the addition of Sample Buffer.\nNote: Refer to Safety Datasheet of DTT and perform the relevant steps in a well-ventilated area.\nWhen the sample buffer reaches 95°C, quickly transfer the finished reaction from step 15 to corresponding well containing the 2× Sample Buffer. Briefly pipette to mix the sample with Sample Buffer.",
    "Cap or seal the tubes or wells and incubate the samples at 95°C for 5 min, then at 80°C for 5 min. If using a thermocycler, set the cap temperature to 105°C to avoid condensation.\nNote: This step denatures the sample for SDS-PAGE and ensures inactivation of PNGase F. The heat inactivation condition of PNGase F was reported by New England Biolabs to be “75°C for 10 min”.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]\nCool the samples on ice.\nNote: Steps 16‒19 can be set as a thermocycler program as below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2892_4.csv\nPause point: Now the samples can be frozen at −20°C for a few weeks, depending on the stability of the proteins of interest.\nWestern blot analysis\nTiming: 1–2 days\nAnalyze the samples with SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot.\nTo control for unspecific bands, include a microsome sample without the protein of interest, such as that from cells transfected with an empty vector or those in which the gene encoding the protein of interest is knocked out.\nIn addition to blotting for the protein of interest, proteins known to contain N-linked glycans in the lumen should be analyzed as quality controls to indicate whether the microsomes are sealed during PNGase F treatment. We have used an ER luminal protein GRP94 and a membrane protein CREB3L1 for this purpose."
