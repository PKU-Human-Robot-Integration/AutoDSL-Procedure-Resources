    "1. Building the Stimulus Apparatus\nConstruct a moveable platform on a sliding track. Each stimulus will be placed on the moveable platform depending on the type of trial called for.\nSecure the track onto a table at an appropriate height that allows for the stimulus platform to be at eye-level with the participant to be seated in front of the table.\nAttach a retractable spring mechanism to the stimulus platform. Connect the input to the spring mechanism to a circuit board.\nPlace a set of lamps behind the participant's seat, facing the stimulus platform. It is important to illuminate the stimulus platform evenly because uneven lighting may cast shadows that interfere with the illusory percept. Connect the set of lamps to a converter that links it to the circuit board.\nAttach a switch box to the edge of the table closest to the where the participant will be seated. Participants place their hand on the switch box at the beginning of each trial and activate the switch as soon as they lift their hand to execute the reach movement. Link the switch box input to the circuit board.\nConnect each output pin of the circuit board to a pin on the microcontroller to control the simultaneous activation of the retraction of the moving platform via the spring mechanism and the turning off of lights once the switch box is triggered. The stimulus must retract and the lights must turn off after the initiation of the reach movement in each trial to prevent any online visual corrections and haptic feedback from occurring. The switch box is employed so that the stimulus retraction and darkness onset are performed only after movement begins, making this an immediate reach task.",
    "Write a MATLAB program that controls the microcontroller signals. Use the MATLAB code to store a sequence of trials and instruct the experimenter what stimuli and viewing conditions to use for each trial.\nConstruct training stimuli, the reverse-perspective stimulus, and the proper-perspective stimulus (Figures 1 and 2). Training stimuli consist of two rectangular panels representing the isolated right surface wall of the middle building embedded in the reverse-perspective stimulus and the proper-perspective stimulus. The purpose of the training stimuli will be discussed in the experimental procedure. Affix red planar disk targets to the right of the midline of the stimuli.\n2. Participants\nObtain written informed consent of the IRB approved protocol in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki before beginning the experimental session.\nTest the participant for visual acuity in each eye, stereopsis (using a Randot-Stereo Test), and eye dominance.\nSet-up the motion capture system. Use fourteen electro-magnetic sensors at 240 Hz and motion-tracking software. The high-resolution recording system allows for the in-depth analysis of the unfolding of movement in three dimensions of fourteen sensors simultaneously, that past studies lack.\n\t\nPlace twelve of the fourteen sensors on the following body segments using sports bands designed to optimize unrestricted movement of the body: head, trunk, right and left shoulders, left upper arm, left forearm, left wrist, right upper arm, right forearm, right wrist, right hand index finger, and right hand thumb.\nPlace the remaining two sensors on the backside of the stimuli directly behind the target location to attain an accurate position of the target in 3D space relative to the participant during the training and experimental blocks.\n3. Experimental Procedure",
    "Place all stimuli out of view from the participant at this time. Turn off all lights except for the lamps used to illuminate the stimulus platform. Dim any computer screens that are in use to run the experiment so that their lights do not interfere with the even lighting projected onto the apparatus.\nBefore beginning any trials, inform the participant of the experiment flow. Notify them of the stimulus retraction and turning off of lights once they initiate movement by lifting their hand off the switch box. Remind them not to try to follow the retracting platform, but to only grab at where the target was last seen. Demonstrate how to grab at where they last remember seeing the target by approaching it normal to the perceived surface.\nBegin practice trials. These trials allow for the participant to become comfortable with the setup. There is no test stimulus on the platform - only a black board with a center pole protrusion used to attach stimuli. Instruct the participant to reach at the center pole and to bring the hand back to rest upon completing the reach, at his/her own pace; repeat for three trials. Note: It is important not to give instructions on how to retract the hand; this component should be automatic and below conscious control.",
    "Initiate training trials. Ask the participant to close his/her eyes after each trial for the remainder of the experiment. While the participant's eyes are closed, affix the training stimulus called for in the MATLAB program to the center pole; the order of training stimulus presentation is randomized by the MATLAB program for a total of eight trials, four for each stimulus. Training stimuli help demonstrate the curvature of the reach when asked to grab at targets on physical surfaces representative of the targets used in the experimental stimuli.\nBegin experimental trials. There are three stimulus conditions for the experimental trials: (1) reverspective under illusory percept, as in Figure 1f (REV-ILLU), (2) reverspective under veridical percept, as in Figure 1e (REV-VER), and (3) proper-perspective (PRO), as in Figure 1c. Recall that conditions (1) and (2) utilize the same physical reverspective stimulus.\n\t\nFirst present the reverspective stimulus. Ask the participant if he/she can stabilize the illusory percept of the middle building \"popping out\" towards him/her. If the participant has trouble stabilizing the illusory percept, place a de-focusing lens on the nondominant eye to weaken stereopsis in order to preserve the illusory percept while maintaining reaching distance to the target18. If the participant requires the de-focusing lens, then make sure to instruct him/her to put them on before each REV-ILLU trial.\nAfter the first REV-ILLU trial, the MATLAB program will randomize the order of trials. For each trial, give the following instructions depending on the stimulus condition:\n\t\tREV-ILLU: \"View the middle building as popping out towards you.\"\n\t\tREV-VER: \"View the middle building as caving in away from you.\"\n\t\tPRO: \"View the middle building as popping out towards you.\"",
    "Once the participant confirms a stable percept, ask them to grab at the target. Perform twelve trials for each condition for a total of 36 experimental trials.\n4. Data Analysis\nTo analyze the movements in terms of the goal-directed reach and automatic retractions, first decompose the data into two movement classes by detecting the point at which the velocity of the movement, after its initiation, nears instantaneous zero velocity.\nTo look for differences in the curvature of hand path trajectories for each stimulus condition, perform the Wilk's Lambda Test Statistic on the 3-dimensional dataset at each point in time during the trajectory. The Wilk's Lambda Test reduces the likelihood test statistic Î› to a scalar value by way of determinants to help us deduce whether or not the mean trajectory vector for REV-ILLU is similar to REV-VER or PRO22.\nTo study the orientation of the hand towards the target at the end of the goal-directed reach, compare the angle formed between the unit approach vector generated by the thumb, index, and wrist sensor positions relative to the target's unit vector normal to the surface (Figures 5a and 5b).\nSubscription Required.
