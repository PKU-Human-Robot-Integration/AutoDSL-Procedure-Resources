    "The animal experiments were approved by the responsible animal care committee (Landesuntersuchungsamt Rheinland-Pfalz) and carried out in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Act (TierSchG). All applicable international, national, and institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.\nIn this study, male C57BL6 mice (age 10-12 weeks) were used. In brief, subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by endovascular filament perforation under anesthesia with isoflurane. The left external carotid artery was prepared surgically. Then, a filament was inserted into the external carotid artery and advanced intracranially through the internal carotid artery which was perforated at the carotid T, inducing a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A rise in intracranial pressure was taken as an indicator of successful endovascular perforation. A detailed protocol of an endovascular filament perforation model of SAH in mice has been published by others8,14.\n1. Perfusion and Endovascular Casting\nIn this study, perfusion was performed 72 hours after induction of SAH. Induce anesthesia by intraperitoneally injecting 5 µg/g body weight (bw) midazolam, 30 ng/g bw fentanyl, and 0.5 µg/g bw medetomidin. Continue only after a sufficient anesthesia level has been reached, which is confirmed by the absence of reactions to pain stimuli.\nOpen the thorax, puncture the left ventricle with a 21G cannula, open the right atrium, and clamp the descending aorta as described elsewhere15.\nPerform a transcardiac perfusion using the following solutions: (i) Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline containing MgCl2 and CaCl2 at pH 7.4 with 1 g/L glucose, and (ii) 4% paraformaldehyde solution.\n\t\nStart the perfusion with solution (i) for 2 minutes and continue with solution (ii) for 4 minutes.",
    "Infuse the solutions at a temperature of 37 °C and using a pressure-controlled pump with variable perfusion rate to perfuse with a constant pressure of 70 mmHg, which was found to be the optimal perfusion pressure to analyze vasospasm in mice16. Avoid a loss of pressure when switching from solution (i) to solution (ii).\nAfter perfusion with solutions (i) and (ii), continue perfusion for 20 minutes at room temperature with radiopaque casting agent (see Table of Materials) at a constant rate of 0.2 ml/min.\nAllow for curing of the radiopaque casting material at 4 °C overnight. Then remove the brain from the skull as previously described17, transfer the sample to 4% PFA solution, and store the sample at 4 °C until micro CT scanning.\n2. Micro Computed Tomography\nPlace the brain in the center of a plastic tube with a blunt anatomical forceps. Choose a tube with a slightly larger diameter than the sample to ensure that the object does not move during image acquisition. Use gauze to close the tube.\nAttach the plastic tube to the micro-stepping motor on the computer-navigated-control (CNC) positioning system in the X-ray cabin, in which the object is rotated around its horizontal axis.\nAlign the sample in the field-of-view under X-ray radiography. To achieve the maximal magnification, place the object as close as possible to the x-ray source and maximize the distance to the detector as far as possible.\nUse a step-and-shoot image acquisition protocol with the following scan parameters: set exposure time to 1 s for each projection to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), tube voltage 80 kV (current 38 µA), 360° rotation resulting in 1,000 projections.",
    "For reconstruction of RAW-Data use a filtered back projection algorithm applying the Shepp-Logan filter with a matrix of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 voxels using reconstruction software (see Table of Materials). For further analysis import the resulting DICOM data into 3D visualization software (see Table of Materials).\n3. 3-dimensional Reconstruction of the Intracranial Vascular Tree and Determination of Vessel Volumes\nNote: Background information on the functions of the visualization software can be found using the function help.\nImport Dicom data into visualization software using the function Import.\nVisualize the vessel tree with the function Volren. Choose the visualization threshold so that the large cerebral arteries are depicted in sharp outlines. It is important to use the same visualization threshold for all data sets belonging to the experimental series.\nVirtually dissect the basal cerebral arteries (Circle of Willis) with the function VolumeEdit by surrounding the vessels with the cursor. Then virtually dissect the vessel segment to be analyzed. Therefore, rotate the 3-dimensional model of the vascular tree in order to precisely separate all small branches from the main artery. It is essential for the further analysis to delete all vessels except the vessel segment to be analyzed.\nApply the function Autoskeleton with threshold set to visualization threshold, which generates a center-line-based SpatialGraph.\nThen, apply the function SpatialGraphToLineSet to create a line set. Divide the line set into its single subsegments by manually choosing the single subsegments with the cursor and clicking on \"split\". This step is crucial in order to calculate the volumes of the single subsegments.\nUse the function LineSetToSpatialGraph to create a Spatial Graph again.",
    "Use the function SpatialGraphStatistics to determine length, volume, and diameter of each subsegment. For color-coded visualization representing the course of the vessel diameter, use the function SpatialGraphView. Set segment coloring to \"thickness\", which correlates with the vessel diameter. It is important to choose the same color map for all datasets belonging to the experimental series.\nAdd the lengths of the subsegments to determine which subsegments are to be included in the further analysis. In the present study we evaluated a vessel segment consisting of 1 mm of the internal carotid artery proximal of the carotid T and 2.5 mm of the middle cerebral artery distal of the carotid T. Then add the volumes to determine the vessel volume of the defined vessel segment."
