    "Clone cDNA into expression vectorTo maximize the chance of generating a soluble, stable, and active protein, it is advisable to test several constructs, including full-length protein as well as fragments truncated based on predicted domain or secondary structure boundaries (Graslund et al., 2008). Histone modification binding domain constructs are frequently used successfully in histone peptide binding assays. However, it is possible that the binding characteristics of the full-length protein may differ slightly from the isolated domain.Two plasmids are provided for dual affinity purification. Select the appropriate plasmid to clone using Gibson assembly (a) or GatewayTM cloning (b). To enable dual tagging, the cDNAs should not have a start or stop codon:Clone cDNA of interest into plasmid pALS343 (pGEX-2TP-cTevHis-Gibson/MCS; Addgene， catalog number: 139788) using Gibson Assembly (standard restriction enzyme cloning may also be used):Digest plasmid with PdiI and KpnI. Purify the fragment from an agarose gel using a standard kit.Design primers as shown below (Figure 1), where the N’s are 21-24 bases of homology to the target cDNA. In the FOR primer, ensure your sequence is in-frame with the AAA AAA (KK) codons. In the REV primer, ensure your sequence is in-frame with the TAC (Y, sense strand) within the KpnI site. To preserve the KpnI site, the final codon of your insert must end in a G. Example primers are shown below.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4168/bioprotoc-11-18-4168-g001.jpgFigure 1. Scheme of the pALS343 vector insertion site and primer sequences used for cloning. A. Cloning insertion site of pALS343 (pGEX-2TP-cTevHis-Gibson/MCS) with key features indicated. B. Example primers indicating reading frame and restriction sites.

Purify the fragment from an agarose gel using a standard kit.",
    "Combine the gel-purified digested plasmid and the gel-purified PCR amplicon with NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix, incubate, and transform competent cells (e.g., DH5α) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.Screen colonies and confirm the reading frame and full sequence of your insert by Sanger sequencing.Alternatively, clone cDNA of interest into destination vector pALS099 (pGEX-2TP-cTevHis-DEST; Addgene #139787) using GatewayTM cloning:Design primers to amplify the cDNA flanked by attB sites as shown (Figure 2), where the N’s are 21-24 bases of homology to the target cDNA. In the FOR primer, ensure your sequence is in-frame with the AAA AAA (KK) codons. The first codon of the insert must begin with a T. In the REV primer, ensure your sequence is in the frame indicated. The last codon of the insert is NAC (in the sense direction).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4168/bioprotoc-11-18-4168-g002.jpgFigure 2. Example primers to amplify an attB-flanked insert for GatewayTM cloning. The N’s represents ~18-24 bases of template-specific sequence.PCR-amplify the cDNA of interest using a high-fidelity polymerase (e.g., Q5 or Phusion polymerase). Purify the fragment from an agarose gel using a standard kit.Create an entry clone and then an expression clone with sequential BP ClonaseTM and LR ClonaseTM steps according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Alternatively, in a 1-step reaction (Liang et al., 2013), combine the gel-purified attB-flanked PCR amplicon with the destination vector, donor vector, and LR ClonaseTM. Transform competent cells (e.g., DH5α) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.Screen colonies and confirm the reading frame and full sequence of your insert by Sanger sequencing.Express tagged proteinPart I. Pilot expression to test induction and solubility Before proceeding to a larger scale growth, test induction conditions and the solubility of your protein as described in this section. Process a known well-expressed and soluble protein (e.g., GST-His from empty pALS343 vector) in parallel as a positive control.Day 1.",
    "Transform expression plasmid into E. coli expression strain Prepare sterile 2× YTG media, sterile glassware, and 5× lysis buffer (see Recipes) for the next day.Transform E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS [Note 1] with expression plasmid miniprep DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions but scaled down by half.Plate on LB-Agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol.Incubate at 37°C overnight.Days 2-3. Culture E. coli, induce expression, harvest cell pellet In the early morning, pick a single colony into a 3 ml starter culture of 2× YTG containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol (2× YTG/Amp/Cam) [Note 2].Grow with vigorous shaking (~250-300 RPM) at 37°C for ~4 h, or until the culture is visibly turbid.To test three induction conditions, prepare a sterile Erlenmeyer flask with 150 ml 2× YTG/Amp/Cam [Note 3]. For aeration, ensure that the flask is ~ 4× the volume of the culture.Dilute the starter culture 1:50 into the 150 ml culture.Grow with vigorous shaking at 37°C until the OD600 reaches 0.6-0.8.Save a 0.5 ml aliquot in a 1.5 ml tube on ice.This will be the ‘uninduced’ control for SDS-PAGE analysis.Keep this sample briefly on ice.When ready, pellet the cells by centrifuging at maximum speed for 1 min in a microcentrifuge at 4°C. Remove the supernatant. Freeze the pellet at -20°C until ready to process for SDS-PAGE.To induce expression, add IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM [Note 4].Mix and split the culture into three sterile Erlenmeyer flasks with 40 ml each.Test several induction temperatures and durations. Suggested conditions are:30°C for 4-5 h.37°C for 3 h.14-16°C overnight (requires a refrigerated shaker).At the end of each induction, remove 0.5 ml of culture.These will be the ‘induced’ samples. Keep sample briefly on ice.",
    "When ready, pellet the cells by centrifuging at maximum speed for 1 min in a microcentrifuge at 4°C. Remove the supernatant. Freeze the pellet at -20°C until ready to process for SDS-PAGE.Transfer the remaining 40 ml cultures to centrifuge tubes. Centrifugation can be done in a low-speed centrifuge in disposable conical tubes (3,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C in SX4750 rotor) or in a high-speed centrifuge in Oakridge type tubes (6,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C).Discard the supernatant.Continue to prepare lysates or freeze the pellets at -20°C or -80°C for longer-term storage.Days 2-3 continued. Lyse E. coli and separate soluble and insoluble fractions Note: Keep samples at 4°C or on ice throughout. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1/40th volume (1 ml) of 1× lysis buffer containing reducing agent and protease inhibitors (see Recipes) [Note 5].Transfer to 1.5 ml tubes on ice.Sonicate with the tubes in an ice-water bath.Suggested starting point for Branson 250/450 with microtip. Optimize for your system.Ensure tip is well-submerged but does not contact tube walls:Set Output = 4.5 and Duty cycle = 50%.Pulse 12 times. Rest on ice for 30 s.Repeat (12 pulses with 30 s rest) up to a maximum of 8 times. Monitor the sample – upon lysis, the sample will become slightly less opaque and slightly darker in colour. This should be evident for a control protein such as GST-His. Lysis can also be monitored by taking small aliquots over time. Centrifuge these aliquots to remove insoluble material and determine the total protein concentration (e.g., using a Bradford protein assay). Determine when the concentration reaches a plateau.Clean the tip well by rinsing and a brief sonication in 70% ethanol.Take two 60 μl aliquots to new tubes to prepare the ‘whole’ and ‘pellet’ samples for SDS-PAGE analysis.",
    "Keep the ‘whole’ lysate 60 μl aliquot on ice for SDS-PAGE analysis (do not centrifuge).Centrifuge the bulk of the sonicated lysate and the ‘pellet’ aliquot at ~20,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min.For the 60 μl ‘Pellet’ aliquot for SDS-PAGE analysis – remove and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in Lysis buffer or PBS to a final volume of 60 μl.For the bulk of the sonicated lysate – transfer the supernatant to a new tube and discard the pellet.Take a 60 μll aliquot of the supernatant to a new tube – this is the ‘soluble’ sample for SDS-PAGE analysis.Freeze the remaining supernatant at -20°C or -80°C for longer-term storage. This supernatant could be used for a small-scale test purification if desired.Days 2-3 continued. Analyze samples on SDS-PAGE Prepare an SDS-PAGE gel (or use a precast gel) as required to resolve your fusion protein of interest.Prepare an aliquot of 4× Laemmli sample buffer with 2-ME as needed (add 100 μl 2-ME per 900 μl 4× sample buffer).‘Uninduced’ and ‘induced samples:Thaw the pellets.Add 1× lysis buffer or PBS to bring volume to 50 μl. Pipette or vortex to resuspend.Add 16.7 μl 4× Laemmli sample buffer with 2-ME.Heat at 95°C for 5 min with intermittent vortexing. Repeat for another 5 min.Spin for 5 min in a microcentrifuge (maximum speed) and take the supernatant to a new tube.Samples are ready to load on an SDS-PAGE gel (load 20-25 μl).‘Whole,’ ‘pellet’ and ‘soluble’ samples (60 μl):Add 20 μl 4× Laemmli sample buffer with 2-ME.Heat at 95°C for 5 min.Spin for 5 min in a microcentrifuge (maximum speed).Samples are ready to load on an SDS-PAGE gel (load 20-25 μl).Run SDS-PAGE and perform Coomassie staining. Note that the ‘whole’/‘pellet’/‘soluble’ samples have been concentrated by 40-fold, whereas the ‘induced’/‘uninduced’ have been concentrated 10-fold.",
    "Analysis – inspect the stained gel for an induction-dependent band that is of approximately the correct molecular weight for your fusion protein of interest.If there is not an obvious induced band of expected size, repeat the SDS-PAGE and perform a Western blot using the Anti-His(C-term)-HRP conjugated antibody. Because it is specific to a C-terminal 6×His tag, this antibody performs well in detecting fusion proteins in E. coli whole cell lysate samples.Assess the proportion of soluble fusion protein and select the best conditions for a larger preparation. Note that a modest level of expression and solubility may be sufficient for a histone peptide array experiment, which may typically be achieved with tens of μg quantities of protein (see Figure 3 below).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4168/bioprotoc-11-18-4168-g003.jpgFigure 3. Selected fractions from a representative preparative protein purification (Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE). Sizes of molecular weight markers (in kDa) are shown to the left of the gel. Positions of bands corresponding to the protein of interest (POI) before and after cleavage of the GST are shown to the right of the gel (orange arrowheads). References to relevant protocol steps are shown below the gel. Note that, for this POI fusion, it is difficult to detect induction by Coomassie stain in the lysate (Lanes 1-2). Nevertheless, sufficient protein was enriched by the 2-step purification (Lanes 9-12). In Lane 6, orange dots mark the positions of cleaved GST (~26 kDa) and the GST-tagged PreScission Protease (~46 kDa), which remain bound to the GSH-sepharose resin.Part II. Preparative protein expression The yield of fusion protein can vary dramatically, in the range of 0.1-10 mg of purified protein per L of culture. For the histone peptide array conditions described in section D, 100 μg would be sufficient for several experiments for a protein that is <70 kDa.Day 1. Transform expression plasmid into E.",
    "coli expression strain Note: We have found that freshly-transformed cells generally perform better and therefore do not freeze glycerol stocks. Prepare sterile 2× YTG media and sterile glassware for the next day.Transform E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS with expression plasmid miniprep DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions but scaled down by half.Plate on LB-Agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol.Incubate at 37°C overnight.Day 2. Culture E. coli, Induce Expression Note: Use flask sizes at least 4× the culture volume to allow sufficient aeration. In the early morning, inoculate a 25 ml 2× YTG/Amp/CAM starter culture with a single colony.Grow for ~5-6 h at 37°C with vigorous shaking.Dilute starter 1:50-1:100 into 1 L of 2× YTG/Amp/CAM.Grow 37°C with vigorous shaking until OD600 reaches 0.6-0.8.(optional) For low temp induction, briefly cool culture flask.Remove 0.5 ml uninduced control culture sample. Store on ice.Induce by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM.Induce for 4 h at 30°C, or as determined in your pilot expression.During this time, pre-weigh and pre-cool centrifuge bottles, rotor, and centrifuge to 4°C.Transfer the culture to centrifuge bottles.Remove 0.5 ml induced control culture. Store on ice and process with uninduced as described in the pilot expression section above.Balance culture bottles and centrifuge at ~ 4,000 × g for 20 min or 7,700 × g for 10 min at 4°C.Decant supernatant. Weigh bottle and calculate the pellet weight.Store at -80°C.Prepare buffers for the next day:Make 1.8 L dialysis buffer without DTT. Store at 4°C.Make purification buffers without reducing agents (2-ME or DTT) or protease inhibitors (PMSF, protease inhibitor tablets), which will be added fresh (see Recipes). Store at 4°C.Purify tagged proteinNote: All steps should be done on ice or at 4°C to minimize protein degradation. Aliquots are saved throughout the process to monitor afterwards by SDS-PAGE. Day 3.",
    "Part I – Lyse E. coli In the case of overnight induction, centrifuge culture and proceed with pellet.Add reducing agents and protease inhibitors to the buffers for glutathione-sepharose purification (see Recipes). Store on ice.Thaw the frozen cell pellet on ice.Pre-chill the centrifuge tubes on ice.Resuspend the bacterial pellet in ice-cold 1× Lysis Buffer containing protease inhibitors and DTT at ~5 ml per gram of pellet. For a 1 L preparative culture, this is usually ~25 ml.Transfer to pre-chilled tubes for sonication.Sonicate while keeping the samples cooled in an ice-water bath.Note: See the sonication conditions and notes in the optimization section above. If a larger tip is not available for your sonicator, split the resuspended culture into an appropriate number of tubes with smaller volumes and re-pool (combine) after sonication. Transfer the lysate to pre-chilled 30-50 ml Oakridge style centrifuge tubes.Remove two 60 μl aliquots for the ‘whole’ and ‘pellet’ fractions. Process in a microcentrifuge as described in the pilot experiment above.Ensure that accurately balanced tubes are prepared. Centrifuge the lysate to pellet insoluble material at 20,000 × g × 30 min at 4°C.During the centrifugation, prepare the GSH-Sepharose resin as described below.Pre-chill a tube for the supernatant on ice.Transfer the supernatant (clarified lysate) to the clean, pre-chilled tube on ice.Day 3. Part II – Purify on Glutathione-Sepharose 4B Note: All steps should be done on ice or at 4°C to minimize protein degradation. The glutathione-sepharose resin should be kept with buffer throughout the procedure. Take care not to lose resin during pipetting steps. Prepare GSH-Sepharose resin:Resuspend the resin by hand (inversion and shaking).For a 1 L preparative culture, use a 500 μl bed volume (BV).The resin is provided as a 75% slurry. Therefore, for 500 μl BV, transfer 666 μl (1.33× BV) to an appropriate tube (e.g.",
    ", 15 ml sterile conical disposable tube).Wash the resin 2-3× with cold 1× Lysis Buffer (or cold PBS and then cold 1× Lysis buffer).For each wash, spin 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C (e.g., in Beckman Allegra swinging bucket rotor) and carefully remove the buffer without disturbing the resin.Use the last wash to split the resin into two 15 ml tubes (or as needed for the sonicate volume).Store the resin in 1× lysis buffer until ready to use.Remove the buffer from the resin and immediately add the clarified lysate prepared above.Bind to GSH-Sepharose rotating at 4°C × 2.5-3 h.During the incubation, add reducing agents and protease inhibitors to other purification buffers as needed.Prepare labelled tubes on ice to collect aliquots for SDS-PAGE analysis: Flowthrough, high salt wash, low salt wash, PreScission buffer wash, PreScission cleavage.Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Save 10 µl of the supernatant (‘Flowthrough’ or unbound fraction).Wash GSH-Sepharose with 10× BV (5 ml) High Salt Wash Buffer. Incubate at 4°C with rotation for 5 min and centrifuging the resin at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C.Save 10 μl of the supernatant (‘High salt wash’)Wash GSH-Sepharose with 10× BV (5 ml) Low Salt Wash Buffer. Incubate at 4°C with rotation for 5 min and centrifuging the resin at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Save 10 μl of the supernatant (‘Low salt wash’).Proceed to elute the protein from the resin by cleaving the GST.Alternatively, the GST-fusion protein can be eluted from the resin using glutathione [Note 6].Wash with 10× BV (5 ml) of PreScission Cleavage Buffer.Remove the wash leaving a volume of ~1 ml.Use the remaining buffer to resuspend the resin and transfer it to a 1.5 ml tube.Wash the original tube(s) used for the binding using an additional ~0.",
    "5 ml of PreScission Cleavage buffer and add this to the 1.5 ml tube.Centrifuge and remove the supernatant.Save 10 μl aliquot of supernatant (‘PreScission buffer wash’).Add 460 μl PreScission Buffer and 40 μl of PreScission Protease (2,000 units/ml).If the resin bed volume used was not 500 μl, scale accordingly.Incubate for 5 h at 4°C on a rotator to cleave and elute the 6×His-tagged protein. The PreScission protease is GST-tagged and will bind to the resin.During the incubation, prepare the TALON resin (see below) and buffers for TALON purificationCollect the cleaved protein in the supernatant.Centrifuge the resin and transfer the supernatant (500 μl) containing the cleaved protein to a new tube on ice.Save 10 μl aliquot (‘PreScission Cleavage’).Add 1× BV (500 μl) Talon Binding/wash buffer to the GSH-sepharose resin. Rotate for 30 min at 4°C.Centrifuge and pool the supernatant with the previous fraction.Add another 1× BV (500 μl) Talon Binding/wash buffer to the GSH-sepharose resin. Rotate 15 min at 4°C.Centrifuge and pool the supernatant with the previous fractions for a total of 1.5 ml.Proceed to the 2nd purification of the 6×His-tagged protein in the next section.Aside – To check if there is protein remaining on the GSH-sepharose resin, add 1× BV (500 μl) of leftover PreScission cleavage buffer to the remaining GSH-sepharose resin. Store at 4°C to take a sample later for SDS-PAGE analysis as described on Day 4.Store the aliquots collected during the purification at -20°C for SDS-PAGE analysis.Day 3. Part III – Purify on TALON beads (Cobalt Sepharose 6B-CL) Prepare the Talon Resin in a 2 ml tube.Thoroughly resuspend the resin.For 1 L purification, use a bed volume (BV) of 200 μl.The resin is provided as a 50% slurry, so transfer 2× BV (400 μl) to a 2 ml tube.",
    "All centrifugation steps with Talon resin below are performed at 700 × g for 2 min at 4°C.Wash 2-3 × with cold 1× PBS or cold Talon Binding/Wash buffer.Keep in Talon Binding/Wash buffer until ready to proceed.To the 1.5 ml pooled supernatants from the first purification step, add MgCl2 to a final concentration of 0.2 mM (3 μl of 100 mM).Centrifuge the Talon resin, remove the buffer and add the 1.5 ml of supernatant from the first purification.Incubate with rotation at 4°C for 1 h.During this incubation, add DTT to the cold dialysis buffer and split it into 3 large beakers with stir bars (600 ml each) at 4°C.Prepare a Dispo-dialyzer chamber by snapping one membrane between the plastic holder and the plastic ring as described in the manual. Add 1 ml of dialysis buffer in the chamber. Leave the chamber open (do not add the 2nd membrane).Place the Dispo-dialyzer in a beaker of dialysis buffer at 4°C on a magnetic stir plate with gentle stirring.Label 1.5 ml tubes to collect fractions and place at 4°C (‘Talon Flowthrough,’ ‘Talon Wash 1’, ‘Talon Wash 2’, ‘Talon Elution 1’, ‘Talon Elution 2’, ‘Talon Elution 3’, and ‘Talon Elution 4’).Set up an empty Bio-Rad mini column over a 1.5 ml collection tube (‘Talon Flowthrough’) at 4°C. If a rack or holder for the mini column is not available, use a clean pipette tip as a wedge to brace the column vertically with its outlet inserted at the top of the collection tube.Transfer the Talon resin and buffer to the empty Bio-Rad mini column at 4°C.Allow the column to drain by gravity flow into the ‘Talon Flowthrough’ tube.When nearly all the buffer is through, change to the ‘Talon Wash 1’ collection tube.",
    "Add 10× BV (2 ml) Talon Binding/Wash Buffer to the column and allow to drain.Repeat the above steps for a 2nd wash.Elute 4× using 1× BV (200 μl) of Talon Elution Buffer for each elution. Collect these fractions in the ‘Talon Elution’ 1-4 tubes.Save 10 μl aliquots of each wash and elution fractions for SDS-PAGE analysis.Cap the column and add an equal volume of Talon Elution Buffer.Pool (combine) the 4 elution fractions.Remove the buffer from inside the Dispo-Dialyzer chamber and add the pooled protein elutions. Seal the top with a 2nd membrane and plastic ring.Allow to dialyze overnight with gentle stirring at 4 °C.Day 4. Finish dialysis and quantify protein. Analyze purification fractions by SDS-PAGE. The next day, transfer the Dispo-Dialyzer to the 2nd and 3rd dialysis beakers for 2-3 h each.During the dialysis:Prepare samples of the used remaining GSH-sepharose and Talon resins (‘post elution’) for SDS-PAGE:Resuspend the resins in an equal volume of buffer as indicated above.Transfer 30 μl to a 1.5 ml tube.Add 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer and heat at 95°C for 5 min.Centrifuge for 1 min at maximum speed.Transfer the supernatant (~20 μl) to a new tube.Store at -20°C for SDS-PAGE.Prepare the aliquots saved during the purification by adding Laemmli sample buffer to a final concentration of 1× and heating at 95°C for 5 min. Briefly centrifuge and resolve the samples on an SDS-PAGE gel of appropriate percentage for the size of your protein.Stain with Coomassie and evaluate the purification as described below in data analysis.Pipette the sample from the Dispo-dialyzer chamber into a pre-chilled tube on ice.Measure concentration with a Bradford or other protein quantification assay, comparing to a standard curve (e.g., of BSA).",
    "Note that the sample must be diluted in a buffer without detergents or reducing agents for a Bradford assay (e.g., PBS). Check an equivalent dilution of the dialysis buffer to ensure that there is no interference with the assay. Dilutions in the range of 1:3 to 1:5 should generally fall in the assay range [Note 7].Aliquot the protein to pre-chilled, pre-labelled tubes.Calculate the amount required for the peptide array assay (see the next section) to estimate the aliquot sizes. Freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided.Also freeze a 2-4 μg aliquot to examine the composition of the final product by SDS-PAGEFlash freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at -80°C.Histone peptide array assayNote: The optimal query protein concentration may be protein-dependent. However, we have found satisfactory results for several proteins using a final concentration of 175 nM. The range of concentrations recommended by the manufacturer is 10 nM to 1 μM. To minimize the amount of protein required, use a dish close to the size of the slide or a specialized slide hybridization chamber. The volumes here were used for a plastic container measuring 34 mm × 88 mm × 28 mm (L × W × H). Day 1. Block and bind protein to histone peptide array All incubations are done on a flat platform shaker with gentle agitation (~80 RPM). A vacuum aspirator may be used to help remove buffer between wash steps. Once wetted with solution, the array should be kept with buffer throughout.Prepare PBS-T, blocking buffer, and pre-binding buffer (see Recipes) [Note 8].Thaw an aliquot of the purified protein on ice.Centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C to pellet any insoluble material.Transfer the supernatant to a clean pre-chilled tube.",
    "Using clean forceps and handling the array at the ends, place the peptide array slide into an appropriate chamber (see Materials and Reagents, section D).Wash briefly 2× with PBS-T.Incubate in 10 ml of blocking buffer for 1 h 20 min at room temperature with agitation.Wash briefly with PBS-T.Incubate in 10 ml pre-binding buffer for 10 min 4°C with agitation.During the incubation on ice, dilute the protein to the desired concentration in a final volume of 4 ml of cold binding buffer.For example, a 4 ml solution containing 175 nM protein requires 700 pmol of protein. For a 25 kDa protein, this is 17.5 μg, and for a 75 kDa protein, this is 52.5 μg:(pmol protein = volume × concentration  = 4 × 10-3 L × 175 × 10-9 mol/L × 1 × 1012 pmol/mol)(μg protein = molecular weight × mol = kDa × 1000 Da/kDa × 700 pmol × 1 × 10-12 mol/pmol × 1 × 106 μg/g)Remove the pre-binding buffer and add the protein solution. Seal the container with Parafilm.Incubate overnight (~12 h) at 4°C with agitation.Store the remaining blocking solution at 4°C for use the next day.Day 2. Part I – Wash and detect protein on array All incubations are done on a flat platform shaker set to ~80 RPM.Wash the array briefly in PBS-T.Wash 3× in ~18 ml PBS-T, 5 min each, at room temperature with agitation.During the washes, prepare the HRPase-conjugated anti-His(Cterm) antibody in 10 ml of blocking buffer at a final dilution of 1:3,500 (v/v) [Note 9].Remove the last wash and add the antibody solution.Incubate for 1 h 20 min at room temperature with agitation.Wash briefly in PBS-T.Wash 3 × in ~18 ml PBS-T, 5 min each, at room temperature with agitation.",
    "When ready to proceed to imaging, remove the last wash and add 5 ml of each ECL reagent [Note 10].Agitate gently by hand for 1min or as directed for your ECL.Blot excess liquid on absorbent paper and wrap the array carefully in plastic wrap.Place in a film cassette along with an autoradiography ladder.Expose to film for 5 min.Expose to another film for 1 min.Develop the films and optimize the exposure time if required.An ideal exposure will have a strong signal-to-background ratio but will not have saturated or over-exposed peptide spots.Examine the two duplicate arrays and if the signals are similar to each other, as expected.Examine the negative control spots (positions P20-P24 in the bottom right corner of the array). It is expected that these would have no or low signal.For representative film images, please see Figure 1B and Figure S2A in Saltzman et al. (2018). If a satisfactory image is not achieved by varying the exposure time, it may be necessary to vary the protein concentration or buffer conditions. For additional troubleshooting, see [Note 8] and [Note 10].Align the developed films with the autoradiography ladder.Carefully mark the slide corners and the positions of alignment grid dots surrounding the array with a Sharpie marker. Take care not to mark on the array area.Day 2. Part II – Scan array and analyze results Scan the film(s) at 600 dpi in grayscale. Turn off any automatic adjustments of the scanner software.If required, use image editing software to rotate the image so that the rows of peptide spots are straight and the array label is on the right-hand side.Crop the image to just outside the array spots and save as .tif.Open the .tif file in ActiveMotif’s ‘Array Analyze’ software.",
    "Following the Array Analyze software manual, select spots to allow the software to overlay the grid of peptide spots on your image. If required, repeat this procedure to ensure good alignment of the image.Enter a sample ‘name’ for your sample. This is appended at the beginning of the filenames of the saved spreadsheets and figures.Select ‘analyze array,’ and the software will calculate the intensity of each spot and open a results window.In the ‘Spot Statistics’ tab, examine the concordance of the left and right array duplicates. A histogram of the error between the duplicates and a scatterplot of the intensity on the left vs. right duplicate can be saved as ‘name_fig1.png’ and ‘name_figXY.png,’ respectively.In the ‘Background Settings’ tab, examine the graph of intensity values. By default, the background threshold is set at the 67th percentile of the spot intensities. However, the background threshold can be manually raised or lowered (by dragging the orange line) to change the stringency with which spots are considered in further analysis. A graph of the ranked intensities can be saved as ‘name_fig2.png’.Examine the additional tabs and save the data tables and graphs as described in ‘Data Analysis’ below."
