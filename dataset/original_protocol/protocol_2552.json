The infectivity of virus stock is assessed by 2 different means including plaque assay (next section, beginning at step 7) or by tissue culture infectious dose-50 (TCID50) assay (beginning at step 14).\nGrow Vero-E6 Cells until 90% confluency in two 75-cm2 flasks.\n24 h before virus inoculation, plate Vero-E6 Cells at 6.5–9.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in ten 75-cm2 flasks in Complete Growth Medium. Each 75-cm2 flask will produce 15 mL of virus stock.\nPlate 2 additional flasks, 1 for mock-infected control and the other one for cell counting.\nNote: It is desirable to produce large amount of virus at a time to have consistency between experimental replicates. Usually, 10 flasks of Vero-E6 Cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection can be prepared. Vero-E6 Cells need to be 85%–90% confluent for virus inoculation and propagation.\nIncubate the flasks at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nCritical: Restart the culture with a new early passage of Vero-E6 Cells if changes in morphology or if virus titers have decreased to below 105 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL.\nCritical: SARS-CoV-2 should not be passaged more than 3 times in Vero-E6 Cells to avoid viral genome mutations that may decrease or change its infectivity.\nThe day after seeding, count the cells and calculate the volume of virus inoculum to have a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU per cell using the following formula:\nVolume of virus needed in mL= (Number of cells in the flask) × (desired MOI) / (virus inoculum titer in PFU/mL).",
    "Note: A 90% confluent 75-cm2 flask contains approximately 6.5–8 × 106 cells. For a virus titer of 107 PFU/mL, the volume of virus needed to inoculate 1 75-cm2 flask of Vero-E6 Cells would be: (6.5 × 106) × (0.01) / 107 = 0.0065 mL= 6.5 μL per flask.\nCritical: To produce SARS-CoV-2 virus stocks, it is important to inoculate the virus at low MOI (MOI=0.01 per cell) to ensure that each cell is productively infected while preventing the formation of defective viral particles.\nCritical: Steps 1–2 can be performed in BSL-1 or BSL-2 containment. From this step on, all procedures (steps 3–6) must occur under BSL-3 containment.\nThaw a vial of SARS-CoV-2 seed stock at 20°C–22°C.\nDilute the necessary volume of virus (calculated above) in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS (Complete Infection Medium).\nInoculate 90% confluent Vero-E6 Cell monolayers with virus.\nRemove the medium from the 75-cm2 flasks containing 90% confluent Vero-E6 Cells.\nWash once with 3 mL of PBS 1× per flask.\nAdd 3 mL of Complete Infection Medium containing the virus (from step 4) to each 75-cm2 flask. For mock-infected control, add 3 mL of fresh Complete Infection Medium.\nIncubate flasks at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nAfter 1 h, add 7 mL of Complete Growth Medium to each flask.\nMonitor the flasks daily for 48–72 h for the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE) using an inverted microscope (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Compare with mock-infected flask as negative control.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2187-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Note that the well corresponding to the 10-7 virus dilution does not show plaque formation but presents a scratch (indicated with a yellow circle) that has been accidentally performed when removing the agarose layer with the flat spoon and can be confounded with a plaque.\n(D) Representative fluorescent image of a typical 96-well plate prepared for virus titer assessment by the TCID50 assay (left). The table (right) shows a representative quantification of the number of positive infected wells that are used to calculate the virus titer by the Spearman-Karber method.\nWhen 90% CPE is observed, harvest the virus supernatant from infected Vero-E6 Cell monolayers.\nCollect the virus supernatant into sterile 15 mL conical tubes. Discard the mock-infected control.\nDispose flasks, remaining cells and pipettes as infectious waste.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 450 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet the cell debris.\nPrepare 200–500 μL aliquots of the supernatant in labelled 2 mL screw-tubes.\nImmediately store the aliquots of virus stock at −80°C.\nNote: The volume of virus stock aliquots will need to be adjusted to avoid repeated freezing and thawing cycles. This will prevent decrease of virus stock infectivity.\nTitration of SARS-CoV-2 virus stock by plaque assay\nTiming: 4 days",
    "This step is required to determine the virus stock titer by plaque assay, which measures infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles by quantifying the plaques generated in Vero-E6 Cell cultures after infection with serial dilutions of the virus stock using a viscous medium overlay. The viscous overlay is used to restrict the spreading of progeny virions to the initially infected foci of cells. In this manner, each infectious particle will generate a single area of cellular death, so called PFU. After incubation, cell monolayers are fixed and stained to visualize the plaques using crystal violet, which stains cells in purple while plaques remain clear. Plaques are then counted to assess the virus titer in PFU per mL (PFU/mL).\nPrepare Vero-E6 Cell monolayers for plaque assay.\nPlate 8 × 105 Vero-E6 Cells in 3 mL of Complete Growth Medium per well of 6-well plate.\nNote: One 6-well plate is prepared per virus stock to be tested.\nIncubate the plate for 12–16 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nAfter 12–16 h incubation, check under the microscope that cells formed a confluent compact monolayer in each well.\nCritical: Step 7 can be performed in BSL-1 or BSL-2 containment. From this step on, all procedures (steps 8–13) must occur under BSL-3 containment.\nHeat the 1% Agarose solution in a microwave and keep the bottle in a water-bath at 55°C.\nPrepare EMEM/14% FBS Medium and equilibrate it at 20°C–22°C.\nDilute the virus stock (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPrepare 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus sample between 10-1 to 10-7.\nFor each virus sample to be titrated, take seven 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and label them with each dilution (10-1, 10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5, 10-6, 10-7).\nAdd 900 μL of Complete Infection Medium to each tube.",
    "Add 100 μL of the virus sample to be titrated to the first tube (10-1) to make the first dilution.\nMix by vortexing the tube. This is your 10-1 virus dilution.\nContinue with serial dilutions by taking 100 μL of the first virus dilution (10-1) and transferring it to the second tube (10-2).\nMix by vortexing the tube. This is now your 10-2 virus dilution.\nFor subsequent virus dilutions repeat steps v-vi by taking 100 μL of the newly created virus dilution and adding it to the next Eppendorf tube until you have reached a 10-7 dilution.\nCritical: Directly discard the tips without pipetting between each dilution.\nInfect Vero-E6 Cell monolayers prepared in step 7 with the serial virus dilutions.\nLabel each well of 6-well plate with the corresponding dilution ranging from 10-3 to 10-7 and 1 well for non-infected control.\nRemove the existent Complete Growth Medium from the Vero-E6 Cell monolayers.\nWash once with 1 mL of PBS 1× per well.\nAfter vortexing the tube, transfer 500 μL of the 10-7 virus dilution to one well of the labelled 6-well plate.\nRepeat this step for 10-6 to 10-3 dilutions.\nNote: It is recommendable to start with the most diluted sample so the same pipette tip can be then used for subsequent pipetting from the most diluted to the less diluted samples.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1 h to allow virus to attach.\nCritical: Redistribute the supernatant by rocking the plates carefully every 15 min to prevent cell monolayers from drying out.\nDuring the incubation time, calculate the volume of Plaque Assay Overlay Medium needed, counting 3 mL per well of 6-well plate. Include 3 mL extra as a control of polymerization.",
    "Note: For example, for a 6-well plate, 6 × 3 mL + 3 mL are needed, i.e 21 mL of plaque assay overlay medium.\nAfter 1 h incubation, remove the viral inoculums from each well and close the plate.\nCritical: Change tips between each well.\nPrepare the Plaque Assay Overlay Medium in a 50 mL conical tube, by quickly mixing 1 volume of 1% Agarose solution (equilibrated at 55°C, see step 8) and 1 volume of EMEM/14% FBS Medium (equilibrated at 20°C–22°C, see step 9) (1:1 ratio).\nCritical: The overlay medium has to be prepared just before being distributed in the plate because agarose begins to polymerize rapidly after mixing with the EMEM/14% FBS Medium.\nAdd 3 mL of Plaque Assay Overlay Medium to each well of 6-well plate.\nCritical: Let the overlay polymerize in the plate under the hood. To check the polymerization status, check the status of the leftover in the 50 mL tube.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 3 days to allow plaque formation.\nVisualize plaques by Crystal Violet staining 3 days post-infection (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Crystal Violet stains proteins and DNA within intact cells. In this manner, areas of infected dead cells will appear as clear spots on the purple cell monolayer.\nAdd 1 mL of 25% Formaldehyde solution per well on top of the agarose to allow fixation of the cell monolayers.\nIncubate for 30 min at 20°C–22°C.\nNote: The fixation step with 25% formaldehyde solution allows for virus inactivation.\nCarefully remove the agarose layer using a flat spatula. Dispose as infectious waste.\nCritical: Do not touch the cell monolayer with the spatula to avoid scratching the monolayer.\nAdd 1 mL of 1% Crystal Violet staining solution per well of the 6-well plate.",
    "Incubate for 10 min at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove the Crystal Violet solution from the wells and wash 3 times with 3 mL of tap water per well.\nCritical: Properly discard formaldehyde and crystal violet solutions as toxic waste, according to institutional rules.\nLeave the plate inverted to air-dry the stained monolayers.\nPause point: At this point, air-dried stained plates can be stored at 20°C–22°C for further quantification.\nEnumerate plaques and calculate the virus titer. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCount the plaques in each well at each virus dilution.\nNote: Discount wells with fewer than 5 or greater than 100 plaques. Take note of plaque size and morphology. The negative control should present a uniform, purple-stained monolayer and is used as a reference control.\nIdentify the first dilution in which a maximum of 50 plaques can be counted. Determine the viral titer of the virus using the following formula:\nPlaque forming units (PFU)/mL = [average No. of plaques] / [Dilution factor × Volume of inoculum added in mL].\nNote: For instance, if you counted 50 plaques in the well corresponding to 10-5 dilution in which you have added 0.5 mL of diluted virus inoculum, the titer of the virus stock would be 50/ (10-5 × 0.5) = 107 PFU/mL.\nNote: We recommend to run the titration in duplicate or to repeat the titration step using another tube from the same viral stock.\nTitration of SARS-CoV-2 virus stock by TCID50 assay\nTiming: 3 days\nAs an alternative method to the plaque assay, this step details how to determine the virus stock titer by TCID50 assay.\nPrepare Vero-E6 Cell monolayers in a 96-well Black/Clear Bottom plate (96-BCB plate).",
    "Plate 30,000 Vero-E6 Cells in 100 μL of Complete Growth Medium per well of a 96-BCB plate. Prepare enough wells to test each virus dilution in triplicate.\nNote: One 96-BCB plate can be used to test 4 different virus stocks in triplicate (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nIncubate the plate 12–16 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nAfter 12–16 h incubation, check under the microscope that cells have formed a confluent compact monolayer in each well.\nCritical: Step 14 can be performed in a BSL-1 or BSL-2 containment. Steps 15–21 must occur under BSL-3 containment.\nInfect the Vero-E6 Cells prepared in step 14 with 10-fold serial virus dilutions.\nRemove the 100 μL of media from the first row of wells of the 96-BCB plate containing Vero-E6 Cells.\nAdd 110 μL of non-diluted virus stock per well.\nUse a multichannel pipette to remove 10 μL of virus from the first row of wells and place it in the second row of wells. Gently pipette up and down to mix the virus with the media. This is now your 10-1 virus dilution.\nRepeat step 15c by removing 10 μL of the virus dilution from the second row of wells (10-1) and adding it to the third row of wells. This is now your 10-2 virus dilution.\nFor subsequent virus dilutions repeat step 15c by removing 10 μL of the newly created virus dilution and adding it to the next row of wells until you have reached a 10-6 dilution.\nIncubate the 96-BCB plate for 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nCritical: Change the pipette tips for each dilution and make sure to properly mix the contents of the well before diluting into the next well. Leave the last lane as a mock sample.\nFix the 96-BCB plate at 24 h post-infection.",
    "Remove the virus-infected media.\nWash the wells 1 time with 200 μL of PBS 1× per well.\nAdd 200 μL of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) to each well and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 20 min.\nRemove the PFA and wash the wells 3 times with 200 μL of PBS 1× per well.\nNote: The fixation step with 4% PFA allows for virus inactivation.\nCritical: After the 20 min-fixation, the full plate should be submerged in 4% PFA solution and incubated for additional 20 min to ensure that any virus found in the plate is inactivated. Once completely inactivated, next steps can be performed in the BSL-1/BSL-2 laboratory.\nPerform immunolabelling of the fixed 96-BCB plate to detect virus infection (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nAdd 100 μL of PBS 1× supplemented with 0.05% Triton-X to each well. Incubate at 20°C–22°C for 15 min.\nRemove the solution and add 100 μL per well of the Intercept® (PBS) Blocking Buffer. Incubate at 20°C–22°C for 30 min.\nPrepare the necessary primary antibody solution by diluting the primary antibody against the virus nuclear protein (NP) at 1:1000 dilution ratio in Intercept® (PBS) Blocking Buffer.\nIncubate with the primary antibody solution as indicated below:\nRemove the Intercept® (PBS) Blocking Buffer from the wells and add 100 μL of the primary antibody solution to each well.\nIncubate at 20°C–22°C for 1 h.\nRemove the primary antibody solution from the wells and wash 3 times with 100 μL of PBS 1× per well.\nPrepare the necessary secondary antibody solution by diluting the anti-mouse IR800CW secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution ratio in Intercept® (PBS) Blocking Buffer. Supplement this solution also with the nuclear dye Draq5 at 1:10000 dilution ratio.\nIncubate with the secondary antibody solution as indicated below:",
    "Add 100 μL of the secondary antibody solution supplemented with the nuclear dye Draq5 to each well.\nIncubate at 20°C–22°C in the dark for 45 min.\nRemove the secondary antibody solution and wash the wells 3 times with 100 μL of PBS 1× per well.\nAdd 200 μL of PBS 1× to each well and image the plate in an Odyssey® Imaging System (Odyssey® M, CLx or DLx models by Licor). Analyse with the Empiria Studio® Software.\nAlternatives: An epifluorescence microscope can also be used instead of the Odyssey® Imaging System to image the immunolabelled plate. In this case, use PBS 1× supplemented with 5% BSA as blocking buffer and perform the secondary antibody incubation using a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 at 1:1000 dilution ratio and the nuclear stain DAPI at 1:2000 dilution ratio in blocking buffer.\nDetermine the number of positive infected wells using the following method:\nDetermine the average intensity of mock-infected cells.\nDetermine the standard deviation of the intensity of mock-infected cells.\nMultiple the standard deviation by 2.\nAdd the 2× the standard deviation to the average mock value. All values above this are considered positive wells.\nNote: For example – Average Intensity=180.2, standard deviation=23.4, 2× standard deviation=46.8, therefore all wells which have an intensity over 180.2 + 46.8 = 227.1 are considered positive.\nUse the Spearman-Karber method to calculate the TCID50/mL using the following formula:\nlog10 50% end point dilution = - (x0 - d/2 + d ∑ ri/ni).\nx0 = log10 of the reciprocal of the highest dilution (lowest concentration) at which all wells are positive.\nd = log10 of the dilution factor (dilution factor= 10).\nni = number of wells used in each individual dilution.\nri = number of positive wells out of ni.\nSummation is started at dilution x0.",
    "Note: For example, if the highest virus dilution at which all wells are positive is 10-4, then x0 = 4; d = 1; log10 of 50% endpoint dilution = - [4 - ½ + 1 ((3+2+1)/3)] = -5.5; Therefore, the 50% end point dilution= 10-5.5 and the titer of the virus = 105.5 TCID50/mL (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nTCID50/mL can be used to calculate the PFU/mL using the following conversion:\nPFU/mL = TCID50 × 0.69.\nNote: For example, if TCID50/mL = 105.5, PFU/mL = 105.5 × 0.69 = 3.2 × 105 × 0.69 = 2.2 × 105 PFU/mL.\nGeneration of kidney organoids from human pluripotent stem cells\nTiming: 18 days\nThe following steps describe the generation of kidney organoids from hPSC in a 96-well floating culture system.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] This protocol is an adaptation of our previous methodology describing the generation of kidney organoids using the transwell culture system3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] and our previous published works using 96-well floating culture system.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] In the next section, day 16 kidney organoids generated in floating culture conditions are exposed to normoglycemic-like glucose culture regimes or high oscillatory glucose culture conditions to emulate a diabetic-like milieu (beginning at step 26).\nSeeding of hPSC for differentiation (day -2 to day 0), see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A.
