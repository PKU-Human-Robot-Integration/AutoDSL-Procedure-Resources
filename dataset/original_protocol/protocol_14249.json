    "All procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and National Research Council’s Guide for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (IACUC) and has undergone approval by the Ohio State University IACUC committee.\n1. Initial Set-up\nPrepare the perfusion solution by combining the following: 86 mL of 25% albumin, 184 mL of Williams’ media, 30 mL of penicillin/streptomycin (10 U/mL penicillin and 0.01 mg/mL streptomycin), insulin (50 U/L), heparin (0.01 U/mL), L-glutamine (0.292 g/L), and hydrocortisone (0.010 g/L) to a total volume of 300 mL. For the base perfusate and PEG-CAT group, add 625 U/mL of PEG-CAT.\nBuffer the perfusate solution using tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (THAM) to pH 7.4. Use an arterial blood gas machine to confirm the perfusate pH.\nSet up the circuit (Figure 1).\nTurn on the water bath warmer and set it to 37 °C. Allow the organ chamber to warm up.\nPour the mixed and buffered perfusate into the reservoir and start circulation.\n\t\tNOTE: The perfusate mentioned in this step was prepared in step 1.1.1.\nTurn on the oxygenating gas (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide) to the flow counter through the in-line oxygenator.\nTurn on the data collection software and click “start” to record for the duration of the experiment.\nSet up the surgical microscope and the operating room (Figure 2).\nTurn on all equipment including the warming board, electrocautery, and the anesthesia and vital signs (heart rate and oxygen saturation) monitoring equipment.\n\t\tNOTE: The microscope settings will vary based on the microscope used and can be adjusted to the user’s comfort.\nFill the 10 mL anesthesia syringe with 10 mL of liquid isoflurane for inhalation (molecular weight 184.5 g/mol) and place in the anesthesia unit.",
    "Position a 0.5 mL syringe of heparin (50 U), the surgical instruments, 4-0 and 7-0 silk suture, sterile cotton swabs, and 4 cm x 4 cm non-woven gauze sponges appropriately (Figure 2).\nPrepare the isoflurane chamber.\n2. Induction of Anesthesia\nWear the following personal protective equipment (PPE): surgical mask, surgical gloves, disposable gown.\nWeigh the rat.\n\tNOTE: We use Sprague-Dawley rats between 250–350 g.\nTurn on the oxygen compressor and isoflurane. Place the rat, after being weighed, into the isoflurane chamber and secure the lid. Induce anesthesia using 6% isoflurane delivered with 2 L/min of oxygen.\n\tNOTE: The exact isoflurane dose used will depend on the specific anesthesia system being used.\nUse electronic clippers to clip the animal’s abdominal hair. \nReplace the animal in the isoflurane chamber.\nTurn on the anesthesia unit located in the operating room.\nRemove the rat from the isoflurane chamber when anesthesia is fully induced. Confirm the depth of anesthesia using a toe pinch.\n3. Procurement Procedure\nPrepare the 16 G portal cuff (Figure 3).\nBegin with a 16 G angiocatheter. Cut a 7 mm section of tubing. Determine the midpoint of the 7 mm section by measuring 3.5 mm. Incise at the midpoint and remove the anterior half of the tubing.\nUse a hemostat to crush this now flat portion. Use a lighter to melt the other end of the angiocatheter to create a lip. Do not place the tip directly into the flame or it will ignite.\nPrepare the bile duct cannula.\nTake a 27 G angiocath and cut off the injection port leaving only the catheter. Connect this to a 10 cm section of the 27 G cannular tubing.",
    "Position the rat with its nose in the anesthesia nose cone, and its four extremities immobilized. Monitor the vital signs by attaching the monitor to the left hind extremity. Perform a toe pinch to confirm appropriate depth of anesthesia. Continue anesthesia at 4% isoflurane (for animals that weigh >250 g).\nSpray the animal’s abdomen with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Allow to dry. Place a sterile drape over the animal.\nMake a midline incision from the xiphoid to the pubis using sharp scissors and extending through the skin (Figure 4). Gently enter the peritoneum and incise the muscle. Take care to avoid damaging the bladder in the inferior aspect of this incision and the liver in the superior aspect of this incision.\nExtend the incision laterally to the left and right to form a cross at the level of the inferior border of the liver.\nTurn the anesthesia down to 2% (for animals weighing >250 g).\nRetract the xiphoid process using a curved mosquito clamp and the ribs using rib retractors (Figure 5).\nCut the falciform, phrenic, and gastrohepatic ligaments with sharp scissors.\nLocate and tie-off the phrenic vein with a 7-0 suture as close to its origin as possible to prevent leaking.\nEviscerate the rat using a sterile moistened cotton tip applicator and wrap the bowel in gauze moistened with 0.9% normal saline. Take care not to stretch the vasculature of the small bowel.\nDissect over the inferior vena cava (IVC) to remove excess tissue. Dissect behind the IVC just superior to the bifurcation and pass a loop of a 4-0 silk suture for later use (Figure 6).",
    "Retract the right kidney to provide exposure to the right adrenal vein. Retract the right lobe of the liver superiorly with gauze. Tie off the right adrenal vein with a 7-0 silk suture as close to the IVC as possible and cauterize across it distal to the tie (Figure 7).\nCarefully dissect out the splenic vein, tie it off using two 7-0 silk sutures and cut across it between the two sutures.\nTie off and ligate additional veins using 7-0 silk suture for additional length on the portal vein, if needed.\n\tNOTE: There are sometimes small branches of the infrahepatic IVC between the right adrenal vein and the inferior liver.\nDissect around the gastroduodenal artery, tie off the gastroduodenal artery with a 7-0 silk suture, and ligate the gastroduodenal artery.\nDissect around the hepatic artery and then place a 7-0 silk suture tie around it (Figure 8).\nDissect out the bile duct.\nCheck the length of the bile duct. Tie off the bile duct at the distal end using a 7-0 silk suture. Place a loop of a 7-0 silk suture around the bile duct as proximally as possible.\nCut a hole that is half the diameter of the duct with small scissors and place a 27 G catheter into the bile duct proximally. Tie the catheter in place using a roman sandal tie suture (Figure 9).\nInject 0.5 mL of heparin (50 U) into the penile vein or IVC of the animal using a 27 G needle.\n\tNOTE: A 27 G insulin syringe can also be used instead.\nClamp and tie off the IVC using the previously placed 4-0 silk suture.\nTie off the hepatic artery using the previously placed 7-0 silk suture.",
    "Clamp off the portal vein using a microsurgical clip. Cannulate the portal vein using a 22 G angiocatheter. Flush the portal vein with 60 mL of cold 0.9% normal saline with 1 mL heparin (100 U) until the liver blanches (Figure 10).\n\tNOTE: If the liver does not blanch immediately it can be massaged with sterile cotton tip applicators.\nExpose the suprahepatic IVC and cut across it as high in the chest as possible.\nPerform a hepatectomy as follows. Cut around the diaphragm, cut the hepatic artery, cut the IVC, cut the portal vein, cut any additional ligaments, and take the liver out. Place the liver in ice cold 0.9% normal saline (Figure 11).\nPlace a 16 G vascular cuff in the portal vein (Figure 12). Place the liver on the ex vivo normothermic liver perfusion circuit.\n4. Ex Vivo Normothermic Liver Perfusion\nNOTE: The perfusate used here was prepared in protocol step 1.1.1.\nPlace the portal vein cannula into the cuffed portal vein (Figure 13).\nDuring the portal vein cannula placement, maintain flow of the perfusate through the circuit at 2 mL/min to start. Watch the monitor for any spikes in portal vein pressure; this may indicate the vessel has become occluded and repositioning of the cannula is needed.\nSuture in the IVC cannula for the return flow of the perfusate using a 7-0 silk suture.\nOnce both cannulas are in place, begin turning up the flow at 1 mL/min until a physiological pressure in the range of 10–16 cmH2O is reached.\nTake a 1 mL sample from pre- and post-ports at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min of perfusion. Divide the 1 mL sample into two 0.5 mL samples.",
    "NOTE: 0.5 mL of this will be used in protocol step 4.5.1, and 0.5 mL will be used in protocol step 4.5.2.\n\t\nSnap freeze 0.5 mL of this sample in cryogenic tubes in liquid nitrogen.\nRun an arterial blood gas analysis using the remaining 0.5 mL of perfusate.\nAfter running the blood gas analysis at each time point (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min) examine the pH levels and buffer the perfusate as needed to return to pH 7.4.\nAt the conclusion of 4 h of perfusion, disconnect the liver from the perfusion circuit. Divide the liver into 0.5 g segments. Snap freeze the liver tissue in cryogenic tubes in liquid nitrogen.\n5. Post-experiment Analysis\nDetermine alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level in the perfusate at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min using a commercial colorimetric assay kit.\nIn brief, incubate the perfusate with the reaction mix reagents at 37 °C for 60 min. Measure the optical density values at 570 nm using a microplate reader.\nHomogenize 0.5 g of liver tissue with 100 µL of lysis buffer and analyze the tissue lysate for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA).\nIn brief, measure the ATP levels of the liver tissue samples using a commercial assay kit. Mix the sample with the reaction buffer and incubate at room temperature for 30 min. Measure the optical density at 570 nm using a microplate reader.\nMeasure the GSH levels of the liver tissue samples using a commercial assay kit. Mix the tissue samples with the assay cocktail. Measure the optical density values at 405–414 nm.",
    "Measure the MDA levels of the liver tissue samples using a commercial assay kit. Mix the samples with TBA and heat to 95 °C for 60 min. Centrifuge the reactant and transfer the supernatant to a 96-well plate. Measure the optical density at 532 nm.\nHomogenize 0.5 g of liver tissue with 100 µL of lysis buffer and analyze the tissue lysate for relative caspase-3/7 activity using a commercial assay kit.\nMix the tissue lysate with the caspase-3-7 reagent assay buffer and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nMeasure the fluorescence level in each well using a microplate reader.\nDetermine the level of apoptotic cells in the liver tissue samples using a commercial in situ death detection kit.\nPre-treat the 0.5 g tissue sections with 10 U/mL Proteinase K for 10 min and then incubate with the reaction mixture at 37 °C for 60 min. Perform the analysis using a fluorescent microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
