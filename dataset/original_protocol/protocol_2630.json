The culture should produce a minimum of 250 mg cell pellet.\nIn a laminar air flow (LAF) bench, inoculate 50 mL of liquid ISP2 in a 300 mL baffled flask with the strain of interest from either an agar plate or directly from a cryostock.\nNote: This protocol has been used successfully with liquid ISP2, YEME, MS and ATCC-2.\nIncubate the culture at 30°C and 140 rpm until the culture can yield two pellets of 250 mg each (typically 2–7 days but it may take longer).\nNote: The growth rate will be highly dependent on the strain and conditions. If after 14 days no growth is observed consult troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nDiscard contaminated cultures\nTiming: 30 min + growth\nContamination often appears in the early growth phase since contaminants (such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus spp.) typically grow at a faster rate than Actinobacteria. If contamination is present, one or more of the following signs may be observed in the culture after one day of inoculation:\nUnder an optical microscope, the typical filamentous morphology of Actinobacteria is not observed (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2288-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Comparison and examination of contamination under a bright field optical microscope in two different grown cultures\nIn the left slide (1000 ×, scale bar 10 µm), a mycelial bacterial morphology characteristic of Streptomyces can be observed. In the right slide (1000 ×, scale bar 10 µm), the bacillary morphology indicates that the culture does not correspond to Actinobacteria. Each slide shows the appearance of the original culture in the lower left corner.",
    "High optical density, measured as OD600 > 2 on a cell density meter, indicates the rapid growth of the culture within hours of inoculation.\nPlace the culture on the table and observe the sedimentation of the cells, Actinobacteria will sediment faster than E. coli.\nOnce sedimented, tilt the flask to one side and observe the migration of the particles. Actinobacteria move faster, whereas contaminants leave a trail behind them.\nIn a LAF bench, streak the culture on an ISP2 agar plate (with the same medium as the previous culture).\nAfter 1 or 2 days in an incubator at 30°C, observe the morphology of the colonies:\nNote: If the colonies have a glossy appearance, the culture may be contaminated.\nAlternatives: Use a toothpick to scrape the surface, if the colony texture is slimy and slippery it is likely contaminated since most of the Actinobacteria will start to crumble or be quite difficult to pull off the surface.\nCell harvesting\nTiming: 2–4 h (28–56 samples)\nIn this step, biomass is collected from liquid culture to prepare it for DNA extraction. In the end, this should result in 250 mg of harvested cell pellet per sample.\nInspect the growth of your liquid culture and note whether the cells tend to grow in an aggregated or turbid manner, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2288-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Morphological diversity of growth in Actinobacteria in liquid medium\nCultures 1 and 2 correspond to a “turbid” type of growth, 3 is an intermediate culture form and would be treated as “turbid”. Cultures 4, 5 and 6 are examples of the “aggregated” type. Close-up pictures of cultures in 6-well plates are shown in circles (no magnification).",
    "In an aggregated culture the cells form small lumps and are not suspended in the medium. Thus, the culture exhibits little to no turbidity instead growing in a flocculent or sedimented manner. This is a common growth pattern for Actinobacteria.\nNote: Aggregation of the cells decreases the area available to enzymes during cell wall degradation, and as such, they must be ground to powder in liquid nitrogen (LN) as part of the extraction process.\nIn a turbid culture the cells grow suspended in the medium producing the opaque/cloudy cultures common for many lab-grown bacterial cultures. Since the cells are not heavily aggregated there is plenty of surface area available for enzymatic activity.\nTransfer a 2 mL aliquot from the liquid culture into an Eppendorf tube.\nNote: If the culture is aggregated, it is often easier to collect the mycelium using a P1000 pipette tip with the end cut off. This will allow the biomass to enter the pipette tip.\nCentrifuge the sample at 13,000 × g for 1 min and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 500 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) and resuspend the pellet by vortexing for 10–20 s.\nCentrifuge the sample again at 13,000 × g for 1 min and discard the supernatant. If there is little to no pellet (less than 150 mg), see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nStore the harvested cells at −80°C at least 12 h or up to several months.\nCell lysis\nTiming: 1–2 h hands-on + 4 h of incubation (28–56 samples)",
    "In this step, DNA is extracted by enzymatic lysis, while RNA and proteins are degraded by treatment with RNAse A and proteinase K. Samples that grew in an aggregated manner need to be ground to powder in LN before enzymatic treatment. As such, they take longer to process and grouping them together is advisable.\nPrepare fresh lysis mix for the number of samples according to the lysis mix recipe in Buffers and solutions.\nFor each sample, dispense 3.5 mL lysis mix into a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nAdd the frozen cell pellet to the lysis mix, according to the culture’s mode of growth:\nIf the sample grew aggregated, grind it into a powder in LN (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Physical disruption of cellular aggregates by grinding in liquid nitrogen cooled mortar).\nFor each sample, submerge a clean mortar and pestle in LN in a LN compatible ice pan.\nCritical: Handle LN with appropriate safety gear (cryo-gloves, safety goggles, lab coat, closed-toe shoes, and long pants).\nOnce cool, remove the mortar and pestle from the ice pan.\nNote: Leaving a small amount of LN in the mortar will ensure the sample stays sufficiently cold.\nPlace the still frozen pellet into the mortar and grind it into a fine powder.\nCritical: The pellet must remain at the temperature of the LN to minimize DNA shearing.\nScrape the powdered cell pellet into the Falcon tube with lysis mix.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Physical disruption of cellular aggregates by grinding in liquid nitrogen cooled mortar, related to step 16\nIf the sample was turbid simply add the frozen bacterial pellet to the Falcon tube with lysis mix.\nHomogenize the sample by vortexing for 10 s.",
    "Incubate the sample at 37°C and 50 rpm for 2 h in a horizontal position.\nNote: This extended incubation allows for complete lysis of the cell walls. The speed of the shaking should not exceed 50 rpm but can be lowered to minimize DNA shearing further.\nAdd 1.2 mL Buffer B2 to each sample.\nIncubate the sample at 50°C and 50 rpm for 2 h.\nNote: This extended incubation allows proteinase K to degrade cellular proteins completely.\nPause point: The now lysed samples can be stored at 4°C for ∼ 12 h.\nDNA purification and precipitation\nTiming: 4–6 h (28–56 samples)\nIn this step, the extracted DNA is purified using QIAGEN Genomic-tip 20/G columns and afterwards precipitated via isopropanol to concentrate the DNA.\nPlace QF Buffer at 50°C until needed.\nVortex each sample for 10 s.\nCentrifuge the samples at 8,000 × g for 10 min.\nNote: This pellets left-over cellular debris, which increases the purity of the extracted DNA and avoids clogging columns.\nFor each sample, place a QIAGEN Genomic-tip 20/G column into a 15 mL Falcon tube using the plastic spacer which comes with the kit.\nCalibrate the 20/G columns with 1 mL of QBT Buffer.\nLoad 2–3 mL of the supernatant by pouring from the samples onto the columns. Take care to avoid the cell debris as it can clog the columns.\nNote: If possible, avoid using a pipette to transfer the liquid to minimize shearing.\nWait for the samples to pass through the columns (up to 20 min). If the samples do not pass through, see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nAdd 2 mL QC Buffer to each column and let it pass through.\nAdd an additional 2 mL QC Buffer to each column and let it pass through.",
    "Discard the flow-through and place the columns into new clean 15 mL Falcon tubes.\nElute the DNA with 2 mL preheated QF Buffer.\nDiscard the columns and save the Falcon tubes with eluted DNA.\nPause point: The eluted samples can be stored at 4°C for ∼ 12 h.\nPrepare 2 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol per sample by diluting absolute ethanol with nuclease-free water. Place the prepared ethanol on ice or in the freezer (−20°C).\nPrecipitate the DNA by adding 1.4 mL room temperature (∼ 24°C) isopropanol.\nClose the tubes and mix each sample gently by inverting the tube slowly until completely mixed (precipitated DNA may be observed as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2288-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. DNA following precipitation with isopropanol\nGreen arrows point to the precipitated DNA.\nCentrifuge the samples for 15 min at 8,000 × g 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant by decanting or pipetting. Then add 2 mL of ice-cold 70% ethanol.\nNote: Take care to avoid dislodging the pelleted DNA. The pellet might not be visible at this stage.\nCentrifuge the samples for 20 min at 8,000 × g 4°C.\nRemove and discard all ethanol solution with a fine tip pipette.\nBriefly leave the tube cap open to let the residual ethanol evaporate from the DNA pellet (maximum 30 s).\nCritical: Do not over-dry a sample. If it happens DNA will not dissolve. This cannot be reverted.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 μL 10 mM Tris-HCl Buffer (pH = 8.0). If the pellet does not resuspend, see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nStore the samples at 4°C at least 12 h to allow for the DNA to be suspended.\nTransfer samples to clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf Protein LoBind tubes.\nStore DNA at 4°C until quality control.",
    "Critical: Avoid freezing HMW DNA after it has been purified to minimize DNA shearing.\nQuality control\nTiming: 5 h (for 28–56 samples)\nIn this step the quality and the quantity of the purified DNA is assessed by its concentration, ratios of absorbance, and degree of fragmentation. The DNA quality control should not be performed before the DNA has had ample time to resuspend (a minimum of 16 h at 4°C).\nDetermine the DNA concentration of the sample by measuring 2 μL sample using the Qubit dsDNA broad range assay.\nNote: The ideal concentration is approximately 50 ng/μL and at least 20 μL. For samples with concentrations below 10 ng/μL, see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nDetermine the amount of short DNA fragments by running 100–200 ng of DNA on a 0.8% agarose gel for 20 min at 5 V/cm.\nThe sample should show a single chromosomal band at the top of the gel as the gel is unable to separate fragments of the length of the average fragment (see example provided in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2288-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Examples of purified DNA on a 0.8% agarose gel\nThe samples that will need further clean-up based on their degree and type of fragmentation are indicated as either needing 0.4 × SPRI clean-up (in turquoise) or SRE clean-up (in orange). The A260/A280 and A260/230 ratios for the samples are provided in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\nIf there are small fragments on the gel (<1.5 kb, lane 7 highlighted with turquoise box in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) the sample can be cleaned by 0.4 × volume SPRI clean-up.\nIf the gel shows excessive smearing indicating fragments larger than 3 kb (see lane 1, 2, 5, and 10 highlighted with orange boxes on Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), the sample can be cleaned using a Short Read Eliminator kit (SRE). See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].",
    "Measure the absorbance at 230 nm, 260 nm, and 280 nm and calculate the A260/A280 and A260/A230 absorbance ratios of 2.5 μL of sample using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.\nNote: If the samples fall outside acceptable ranges, that is a 260/280 ratio between 1.8–2.0 and 260/230 ratio between 1.9–2.2 Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nStore samples at 4°C after QC.\nDNA library preparation\nTiming: 2 h (12–16 samples)\nIn this step, each sample’s HMW DNA is sheared and has a unique barcode attached using the protocol for the SQK-RBK110.96 kit (Version: RBK_9126_v110_revF 24 Mar 2021) to generate 12–16 DNA libraries that are subsequently pooled into a multiplex sample for sequencing. Ideally, samples with concentrations of ∼ 50 ng/μL (± 10 ng/μL) should be used to promote equimolarity. If the samples do not meet these guidelines, it is advisable to dilute the samples at least one day before preparing the libraries, allowing HMW DNA to be suspended in the final volume at 4°C, and remeasure the DNA concentration as HMW DNA dilutions are highly inaccurate.",
    "Note: The SQK-RBK110.96 protocol has been optimized for the present workflow by modifying the following elements: (1) The initial amount of HMW DNA per sample has been increased from 50 ng to 600 ng and is adjusted to a volume of 27 μL with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (instead of 9 μL and nuclease-free water). (2) To maintain the volume proportion, 3 μL of Rapid Barcode is added to the diluted samples. Hence, the concentration of HMW DNA in relation to barcode has increased by a factor of 4 in comparison with the commercial protocol. (3) For the SPRI clean-up step, the quantity of beads has been modified from 1 × to 0.4 × times the library volume, to remove small fragments and other impurities. In addition, the release of HMW DNA during elution was increased by incubation for 2 min at 50°C.\nPreheat the thermocycler to 30°C and the heating block to 50°C.\nHandle kit components as shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2288_13.csv\nAdjust the volume of each sample following the ratio of 600 ng template DNA to 3 μL of Rapid Barcode:\nIn PCR tubes, transfer 600 ng genomic DNA per sample adjusting the volume to 27 μL with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0.\nSpin down the Rapid Barcode plate in a microplate centrifuge. Add 3 μL of barcode (RB01-96), one for each sample. A multichannel pipette can be used for this step.\nAdd one barcode per sample.\nSeal the PCR tubes with strip lids.\nRegister samples and corresponding barcodes.\nMix the sample tubes gently by flicking and spin down in a microcentrifuge.\nIncubate in a thermocycler at 30°C for 2 min, and then at 80°C for 2 min.\nBriefly put the tubes on ice for cooling down.",
    "Pool the entire volume from all barcoded samples (libraries) in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf Protein LoBind tube, noting the total volume.\nInto the tube containing the pooled library, add 0.4 times the volume of resuspended SPRI beads. Mix the pooled sample by flicking the tube.\nNote: The ratio can be varied, where 0.4 × removes fragments shorter than 1.5 kb.\nIncubate tubes on a hula mixer for 5 min at room temperature (∼ 24°C, speed 10 rpm, keep tubes in horizontal position). Meanwhile, prepare 3 mL of fresh 80% (v/v) ethanol in nuclease-free water.\nSpin down the sample and pellet on a magnet for few minutes.\nKeep the tube on the magnetic rack and discard the supernatant.\nKeep the tube on the magnet and wash the beads with 750 μL of freshly prepared 80% (v/v) ethanol without disturbing the pellet.\nIncubate for 30 s.\nRemove the ethanol using a pipette and discard.\nWash again with 750 μL freshly prepared 80% ethanol for a total of two washes.\nBriefly spin down and place the tube back on the magnet.\nPipette off any residual ethanol with a fine tip pipette.\nAllow to dry for no more than 30 s, do not dry the pellet to the point of cracking.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic rack and resuspend the pellet in 15 μL Elution Buffer (EB) by gently flicking the tube.\nIncubate samples for 2 min at 50°C.\nIncubate for 8 min at room temperature (∼ 24°C).\nPellet the beads on a magnet until the eluate is clear and colorless.\nTransfer 13 μL of eluate into a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf Protein LoBind tube, while taking care to avoid transferring the beads.\nQuantify the concentration of the eluted sample, using 2 μL in a Qubit fluorometer.",
    "Note: If concentration is above 100 ng/μL, dilute with EB buffer for a final concentration of 50 ng/μL in a volume of 13 μL. Measure the concentration again using 2 μL of sample in Qubit.\nAdd 1 μL of RAP F to the remaining 11 μL of barcoded DNA.\nMix gently by flicking the tube, and spin down.\nIncubate the reaction for 5 min at room temperature (∼ 24°C).\nStore the pooled library on ice until ready to load on the flow cell.\nPriming and loading the SpotON flow cell\nTiming: 15 min (for step 73)\nA new flow cell FLO-MIN106D (9.4.1) usually has 1,300–1,500 available nanopores and produces 8–12 Gbases in <24 h with the present method. Although the SQK-RBK110.96 kit has the capacity to sequence 96 samples at a time in a single flow cell, the number of samples is limited by the amount of data necessary per sample. For practical purposes, it is assumed that each sample requires about 100 nanopores to be successfully assembled after sequencing for approximately 16 h. Thus, 12–16 samples can be sequenced per flow cell in <24 h.\nAllow the flow cell R9.4.1 to come to room temperature (∼ 24°C) for at least 5 min before inserting it into the MinION Mk1B device.\nDetermine the number of active pores in the flow cell by selecting “Check flow cell” in MinKNOW.\nOpen the priming port and check for a small air bubble under the cover.\nDraw back a small volume to remove any bubble:\nInsert a P1000 tip into the priming port.\nTurn the pipette’s thumbwheel anti-clockwise until the dial shows a gain of no more than 20–30 μL or until a small volume of storage buffer (yellow color) is entering the pipette tip.",
    "Critical: The introduction of air bubbles into the flow cell in any step will permanently damage the integrity of the pore array.\nPrepare the flow cell priming mix by adding 30 μL of FLT to 1,170 μL of FB, and mix by pipetting, being careful to avoid foaming/air bubbles.\nNote: Keep the FB-FLT mix at room temperature (∼ 24°C), not on ice.\nLoad 800 μL of the priming mix into the flow cell via the priming port and wait 5 min.\nIn a new tube, prepare the library for loading as follows (total volume 75 μL):\n37.5 μL SBII sequencing buffer.\n25.5 μL LBII loading beads (mix immediately before use).\nDNA library 12 μL.\nComplete flow cell priming:\nGently lift the SpotON sample port cover to make the SpotON sample port accessible.\nLoad 200 μL of the priming mix into the flow cell via the priming port (not the SpotON sample port).\nMix the prepared library gently by pipetting just before loading to resuspend the loading beads.\nLoad all 75 μL of sample into the flow cell via the SpotON sample port in a dropwise fashion.\nTurn back the SpotON sample port cover, making sure the bung enters the SpotON port, close the priming port and close the MinION lid.\nStarting the flow cell sequencing run\nTiming: 5 min\nOpen MinKNOW (v. 21.10.4).\nSelect “Start” then “Start sequencing” and fill in information, as requested:\nSelected positions.\nPosition: select the MinION device.\nChoose an Experiment number and Sample ID.\nVerify the flow cell ID number.\nKit.\nSelected kit: SKQ-RBK110.96.\nRun options.\nRun length: 72 h.\nBias voltage: -180 mV.\nAdaptive sampling: Off.\nBasecalling.\nBasecalling: On (High-accuracy basecalling).\nBarcoding: On.\nTrim barcodes: On.\nDetect mid-read barcodes: On.\nAlignment: Off.\nOutput.\nFAST5: On (Raw, VBZ, 4,000 reads per file).",
