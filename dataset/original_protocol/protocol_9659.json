    "NOTE: The workflow for contractility and impedance/EFP measurement is given in Supplementary Figure 2.\n1. Plate coating\nOpen the vacuum-sealed packaging and take out the 96-well plate. Handling procedures for 96-well plates of both modules are the same. Leave the contraction plate covered by the additionally supplied membrane guard until measurement in the contractility module.\nCoat the flexible 96-well plates for seeding cardiomyocytes.\n\t\nPrepare a diluted EHS gel coating solution by transferring 2.75 mL of EHS gel ready-to-use solution in a sterile centrifuge tube. Then add 8.25 mL of DPBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Mix the solution carefully.\n\t\tNOTE: Optionally, fibronectin can also be used for coating the wells: prepare 13 mL of fibronectin coating solution in a sterile centrifuge tube by diluting 650 µL of fibronectin stock solution (1 µg/mL) in 13 mL of DPBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, resulting in a 50 µg/mL working solution. Mix the solution carefully.\nTransfer the coating solution into a sterile reagent reservoir placed in the lab automation robot.\nAdd 100 µL of the coating solution per well with the lab automation robot by using the program \"ADD100µL\". Place the lid back onto the 96-well plate and incubate for 3 h at 37 ˚C.\n\t​NOTE: The program for the lab automation robot needs to be preset manually beforehand.\n2. Seeding of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes into flexible 96-well plates (Day 0)\nThaw the cells according to manufacturer's guidelines.\nCount the cells with a manual counting chamber and adjust the cells in the recommended plating medium according to the cell manufacturer instructions (e.g., 1 x 105 cells/well), resulting in 11 x 106 cells/11 mL for seeding an entire 96-well plate.",
    "Remove the EHS gel solution from the wells with the lab automation robot using the program \"REMOVE100µL\". Remove the reagent reservoir containing the dispensed coating solution from the robot.\nTransfer the cell suspension (11 mL total) into a sterile reagent reservoir placed in the lab automation robot and seed the cells with 100 µL/well using the program \"CELLS_ADD100µL\".\nImmediately after cell seeding, transfer the flexible 96-well plate into the incubator (37 ˚C, 5% CO2, humidity-controlled) and let the cells settle overnight.\n3. Medium exchange of flexible 96-well plates (Day 1)\nWarm at least 22 mL of cardiomyocyte maintenance medium per plate to 37 ˚C in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, 18-24 h after seeding the plates.\nTransfer the fresh medium (at least 22 mL) into a sterile reagent reservoir and leave it right next to the lab automation robot. Place an empty reagent reservoir in the robot and perform medium removal with the program \"REMOVE100µL\". Afterward, exchange the reagent reservoir containing the waste medium with the reagent reservoir containing the fresh medium and dispense 200 µL of the fresh medium per well with the program \"ADD100µL\". Perform this step twice to reach 200 µL/well.\nImmediately after medium exchange, transfer the plate back into the incubator.\nPerform a medium exchange (200 µL/well) every other day until compound addition.\n4. Final medium exchange before compound addition (Day 5-7)\nPerform a final medium change 4-6 h before compound addition.\nWarm at least 22 mL of assay buffer for one flexible 96-well plate. The assay buffer consists of maintenance medium or derivatives thereof (e.g., low/no serum media, phenol red free media, or other isotonic buffers).",
    "Transfer the fresh medium into a sterile reagent reservoir and leave it right next to the lab automation robot. Place an empty reagent reservoir in the robot and perform medium removal. Afterward, exchange the reagent reservoir containing the waste medium with the reagent reservoir containing the fresh medium and dispense 200 µL/well of the fresh medium.\nImmediately after medium exchange, transfer the flexible plate back into the incubator.\n5. Compound addition and data recording (Day 5-7)\nNOTE: An example measurement plan for the experiment is given in Supplementary Figure 3.\nPrepare working solution per compound at 4x concentration in the laminar flow hood using a sterile regular 96-deep well plate. The compound solution is based on the assay buffer used in step 4. Transfer the 96-deep well plate containing the compound solution for at least 1 h into the incubator to adjust it to the same condition as the flexible plate.\n\tNOTE: The 1x concentration of each drug used for every experiment is provided in the figures and legends.\nTransfer the plate to the respective measurement device 1 h before performing a baseline measurement.\nOpen Edit Protocol in the control software (part of the hybrid cell analysis system) and select the respective measurement mode contractility or impedance/EFP.\nDefine the sweep duration (length of one measurement; e.g., 30 s) and the repetition interval (time between measurements; e.g., 5 min) and save the protocol number.\nSelect Start protocol > Continue and fill in the requested fields.\nFinally, select Start measurement. Perform a minimum of three baseline measurements (sweeps) in 5 min intervals shortly before compound addition.\n\tNOTE: Example data of a contractility baseline measurement using the contractility module before compound addition is depicted in Supplementary Figure 4",
    "Remove 50 µL of the assay buffer from each well without removing the flexible 96-well plate from the measurement device.\nAdd 50 µL of the 4x concentrated compound solution into each well of the plate, according to the measurement plan.\nSelect Add region marker and define the compound plate layout and the volume of the compound solution after compound addition.\nFinally, select Proceed with standard measurement or Proceed with measurement series according to the experimental plan.\n6. Data analysis\nWith recording software, measure sweeps, whose length and repetition interval are defined by the user.\nWith analysis software, capture the shape of the signal by reading out parameters like amplitude, beat rate, pulse width, and so forth, automatically.\n\tNOTE: An averaged signal including the standard deviation, the so-called mean beat, is automatically calculated based on the data of one sweep. The user can define the contractility/IMP/EFP parameters that the software calculates and display.\nWith analysis software calculate the dose-response curve and IC50/EC50 for each compound.\n\tNOTE: The raw data and the analysis results generated with the analysis software can be easily exported in a variety of formats. Finally, the data reports are automatically generated to summarize and archive the experimental results. A comprehensive description of what and how an EFP signal is measured is discussed in 17.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
