Both chemically conjugated or biosynthetic DMNB-proteins can be used with the protocol.\nNote: All centrifugations should be performed at 1300 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. If beads of different size are used, centrifugation conditions should be adjusted accordingly.\nNote: During incubation time the beads must always be in suspension. Avoid beads settlement by periodic vortex mixing or orbital rotation.\nTransfer 50 μL per tube of well resuspended silica Protein A beads to 6 Eppendorf 1.5 mL tubes.\nAdd 200 μL of PBS to each tube, resuspend by vortex mixing for 1 min.\nCollect the beads by centrifugation. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 one more time.\nMake 1.3 mL 0.95 mg/mL of anti-DMNB MAbs 12B6 solution in PBS. Determine the initial amount of MAbs in solution by taking A280 reading.\nAdd 200 μL per tube of prepared anti-DMNB MAbs 12B6 to the washed beads, resuspend by vortexing and incubate in orbital rotator for 1 h at 20°C–22°C.\nNote: Alternatively, anti-DMNB MAbs can be bound by 16–18 h incubation at 4°C.\nCollect the beads by centrifugation, save the supernatant, take its A280 reading and determine the amount of unbound MAbs.\nCalculate the amount of MAbs bound to the beads. You should expect approximately 30 μg of MAbs bound to the beads equivalent to 50 μL of initial bead suspension. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]\nAdd 200 μL of PBS to the beads and rinse as above (steps 2 and 3).\nAdd 300 μL of PBS/1% BSA to the beads, incubate in orbital rotator for 1 h at 20°C–22°C.",
    "Collect the beads by centrifugation and rinse two times as above (steps 2 and 3).\nMake 1.3 mL of a DMNB-protein solution.\nIf working with bioconjugted EGFP D117C-DMNB, make solution in PBS at 25 μg/mL.\nIf working with cell lysate containing biosynthetic SUMOstar I106C-DMNB, dilute the lysate 1:10 in PBS with added cOmplete™, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail.\nCritical: This and all subsequent steps should be performed in the dark: wrap tubes in aluminum foil, dim the light in the room as much as possible.\nAdd 200 μL of the DMNB-protein solution to each tube containing the beads. Mix thoroughly by vortex mixing and incubate with orbital rotation at 20°C–22°C for 1 h. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nNote: Alternatively, DMNB-proteins can be bound by 16–18 h incubation at 4°C.\nCollect the beads by centrifugation. At his point, the IC complexes are fully assembled.\nWash the IC complexes three times with 300 μL PBS/2 mM DTT as above (steps 2 and 3).\nUse 200 μL of PBS/2 mM DTT to combine and resuspend the IC complexes from each 3 tubes into one aliquot, finally resulting in 2 tubes, each containing 200 μL of IC suspension. One aliquot is required to make samples for HPLC/ESI-MS analysis (steps 17–23), while the other aliquot will be used to make samples for SDS-PAGE analysis (steps 24–28).\nPause Point: We recommend to use the IC complexes immediately. Alternatively, they can be stored at 4°C until the next day.\nLight-controlled photochemical release of uncaged proteins\nTiming: 2 h\nDuring this step, the IC complexes are exposed to 365 nm light (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and photocage-free proteins are released into solution (Wang, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Samples for HPLC/ESI-MS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] steps 19–22) and SDS-PAGE analyses (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] steps 19–22, 25, and 26) are prepared.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/592-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Sample handling scheme",
    "Note: Prepare the UV light source for work ahead of time.\nNote: All centrifugations should be performed at 1300 × g for 5 min at 10°C. If different beads are used, centrifugation conditions should be accordingly adjusted.\nCritical: Handle the IC complexes in the dark: keep racks with tubes covered with aluminum foil, dim the light in the room as much as possible.\nCollect the IC complexes from one of the 200 μL preparation (step 16) by centrifuging. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL of PBS/10 mM L-Met buffer, resuspend very well by pipetting and vortex mixing.\nMake two 65 μL aliquots:\n-UV. Transfer 65 μL of IC suspension to a new tube. Keep at 4°C.\n+UV. Transfer 65 μL of IC suspension to a cap cut from the 0.5 mL Protein LoBind tube.\nKeep the remaining IC suspension at 4°C.\nPlace the cap on a pre-chilled mirror and assemble under the LED light source (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Turn on the UV light and let run for 10 min.\nNote: Our in-house LED light source was operating at an optical power of 6.2 mW directed at a cap surface area of 0.8 cm2, which afforded a nearly complete removal of DMNB-groups from the target proteins after a 10 min exposure. When other 365 nm light sources are used, optimal exposure time can be determined in control experiments by following the decaging efficiency of a particular DMNB-protein in solution at different time points by HPLC/ESI-MS.\nCritical: It is essential to use shielding against UV illumination.\nThoroughly resuspend the beads inside the cap by pipetting and transfer to a new tube.\nCentrifuge the -UV (step 19a) and +UV (step 21) samples.",
    "Transfer 40 μL of each supernatant to HPLC tubes, add 2 μL of 1 M DTT, mix thoroughly and proceed with the HPLC/ESI-MS analysis (steps 29–31).\nRepeat steps 17–22 with a second aliquot of IC complexes (step 16).\nWithout disturbing beads, carefully aspirate and transfer supernatants to new tubes; save tubes containing packed beads.\nPrepare samples for SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\n-UV solution. Transfer 45 μL of supernatant to a new tube.\n+UV solution. Transfer 45 μL of supernatant to a new tube.\n-UV beads. Reconstitute suspension by adding 65 μL of PBS/10 mM L-Met buffer to the packed beads and mixing thoroughly. Transfer 45 μL of suspension to a new tube.\n+UV beads. Reconstitute suspension by adding 65 μL of PBS/10 mM L-Met buffer to the packed beads and mixing thoroughly. Transfer 45 μL of suspension to a new tube.\nIC suspension. Resuspend saved IC complexes (step 19c), transfer 45 μL of suspension to a new tube.\nAdd 15 μL of reducing 4× Laemmli sample buffer to each sample, mix thoroughly and heat at 95°C for 10 min.\nPause Point: Samples can be stored at −20°C up to a week. Reheat at 95°C for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE analysis.\nLoad 8 μL of each sample on a SDS-PA gel (37.5:1). Use 11% and 15% SDS-PA gels to fractionate EGFP and SUMOstar proteins, respectively. Run and visualize by standard procedures.\nOptional: Same samples (10 μL) can be analyzed by western blotting.\nCharacterization of released proteins by HPLC/ESI-MS\nTiming: 2–6 h\nDuring this step, protein samples are fractionated on a reversed-phase HPLC column and the molecular masses of eluting major species are determined via ESI/Q-TOF mass spectrometry.\nNote: Prepare the HPLC/ESI-MS system for work ahead of time.\nPlace protein samples (from step 23) inside the autosampler chamber, prechilled to 4°C.",
    "Load 40 μL of sample onto the HPLC column, apply linear chromatography gradient of solvents A (1% formic acid in water) and B (1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at flow rate of 0.4 mL/min at 30°C as follows: 0–1 min, 2% B; 1–6 min, 2%–98% B; 6–7 min, 98% B; 7–9 min, 98%–2% B; 9–10 min, 2% B.\nCollect high-resolution mass spectra for protein products at 100–3200 m/z range, positive ionization mode.\nAnalyze the data using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis B.03.01 software, applying deconvolution parameters for protein mass spectra: Maximum entropy; calculation range of 4,000–80,000 Da. Use ProtParam tool (web.expasy.org/protparam/) to calculate theoretical mass values.\nNote: Manual adjustments based on the nature of protein maturation or chemical modifications may be required."
