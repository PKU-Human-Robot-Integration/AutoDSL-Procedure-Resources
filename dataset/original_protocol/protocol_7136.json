    "Spheroid CultureGrow tumor cells to ~70% confluence in a T-75 cell culture flask with normal supplemented growth media optimized for the cell lines of choice.One to three days prior to the Seahorse extracellular flux assay, wash cells with 5 mL of warm PBS and detach using 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA by incubating at 37°C for 10 min for ES-2 and OVCAR3 cells, and 15 min for OVCA433 cells. The time for trypsinization should be optimized for the cell lines used.Deactivate trypsin/EDTA with 6 mL of fully supplemented growth media, collect cells, and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min. Remove trypsin/media and wash cells with 5 mL of warm PBS. Repeat centrifugation and remove PBS.Resuspend cells in fully supplemented growth media (5 mL). In a 1.5 mL tube, add trypan blue at a 1:1 ratio to 0.2 mL of resuspended cells, and count viable cells via the trypan blue exclusion method, using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter. Derive final cell numbers by considering the trypan blue dilution factor. Alternate cell counting methods may be used. A single T-75 flask of ovarian cancer cells will typically yield ~0.8 × 106cells/mL.Dilute cells to 5 × 103 cells/mL and seed into a 96-well round bottom ULA plate, by pipetting 1,000 cells per well in 200 µL of growth media.Notes:  The use of round bottom ULA plates is recommended, as this is the most effective method for producing uniform-sized single spheroids per well. This ensures accurate transfer of predetermined size and numbers of spheroids to the Seahorse assay plate (Figure 1). The need for 1,000 cells per well was determined for ovarian cancer cell lines ES-2, OVCAR3, and OVCA433 to achieve uniform spheroid formation in 96 well ULA plates.",
    "Cell numbers per spheroid may require optimization depending on the cell lines used. It should be kept in mind that increasing cell numbers may lead to larger spheroids with hypoxic cores, potentially influencing mitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, adequate penetrance of compounds used in the Seahorse stress assays needs to be considered. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4321/bioprotoc-12-04-4321-g001.jpgFigure 1. Image of ES-2 cell spheroids pre and post extracellular flux assay run. Spheroids remain intact after the completion of the assay. Scale bar = 1mm.Incubate cells in ULA plates for 24-72 h under normal cell culture conditions in a humidified cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). The timing in ULA conditions is dependent on the experimental design and cell lines used.If comparing bioenergetics of spheroids to attached cells, follow steps A1–A4, and seed cells directly into Seahorse XFp wells. The number of cells seeded per well is dependent on proliferation rate differences between attached and spheroid cultured cells, therefore, the same number of cells should be plated in attached conditions relative to the number of spheroids per Seahorse well x cells/spheroid, for comparison.Preparation of Seahorse Reagents and assay setupNote: The following should be prepared a day before the Seahorse extracellular Flux Assay. Hydrate the XFp sensor cartridge, by adding 200 µL of sterile ddH2O to each well and 400 µL into the outer moats surrounding the wells of the utility plate. Place sensor cartridge into a 37°C humidified non-CO2 incubator overnight. (For more information on preparing the cartridge refer to: https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay#chapter2_3[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay], https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/Hydrating_an_XFp_Sensor_Cartridge.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/Hydrating_an_XFp_Sensor_Cartridge.pdf]).Turn on the Agilent Seahorse XFp Analyzer to ensure the temperature of the machine is at 37°C on the day of the assay.Open the wave desktop software and navigate to the template tab.Select the XFp cell Mito Stress test template.",
    "Under the tab “group definitions” in “assay navigation”, assign the experimental groups and proceed to design your plate map with your groups in the next tab. Lastly, under the “protocol” tab, set up the spheroid mitochondrial stress test assay with the following parameters:Three repeats: mix for 3 min, and measure for 3 min.Inject Oligomycin A in Port A.Three repeats: mix for 3 min, and measure for 3 min.Inject FCCP in Port B.Three repeats: mix for 3 min, and measure for 3 min.Inject Rotenone/Antimycin A.Three repeats: mix for 3 min, and measure for 3 min.Select the XFp cell Glycolysis Stress test template. Define your experimental groups and design your plate maps in the assay navigation. Set up the protocol for the spheroid glycolysis stress test assay with the following run times:Three repeats: mix for 3 min, and measure for 3 min.Inject Glucose in Port A.Three repeats: mix for 3 min, and measure for 3 min.Inject Oligomycin in Port B.Three repeats: mix for 3 min, and measure for 3 min.Inject 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose in Port C.Three repeats: mix for 3 min, and measure for 3 min.Note: The above assay run protocols may need to be adjusted for individual experimental setups. If a response plateau is not reached after the indicated number of reads following addition of drug, the number of reads and measure times should be increased to ensure that maximal effects of compounds are recorded. For dense and larger spheroids, five repeats of mix and measure after addition of a drug is recommended. Save the templates as new protocols and transfer to the Agilent Seahorse XFp Analyzer via the network or a USB drive.Note: For more information on experiment design and assay setup in Wave please refer to: https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay - chapter3_4[href=https://www.agilent.com/en/product/cell-analysis/how-to-run-an-assay%20-%20chapter3_4], https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/S7894-10000_Rev_C_Wave_2_6_User_Guide.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/S7894-10000_Rev_C_Wave_2_6_User_Guide.pdf]).",
    "Transfer of Spheroids into Seahorse Cell Culture PlatesOn the day of the assay, prepare the Seahorse XF assay media:For the mitochondrial stress test, supplement 10 mL of Seahorse XF base media (DMEM or RPMI, depending on cell line) with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 10 mM glucose. A volume of 10 mL of assay media is sufficient to run one XFp miniplate and to make compound dilutions. If multiple plates are assayed, or the assay is performed in a XF96 platform, the amount of assay media prepared should be scaled up accordingly.For the glycolysis stress test, supplement 10 mL of Seahorse XF base medium with 2 mM glutamine.Note: Seahorse XF assay media lacks sodium bicarbonate to maintain low buffering capacity. For the same reason, it is recommended to avoid the use of serum in the assay media. If cells are sensitive to a lack of FBS during the assay run, addition of 1% of FBS can be tested. Warm the assay medium to 37°C prior to adjusting the pH to 7.4, using HCl or NaOH. Filter sterilize using a 0.2 µm syringe filter.Replace growth media with Seahorse XF assay media and move spheroids from round bottom ULA well plates into the XFp cell culture plate, approximately 1–2 h prior to the assay run, using the following steps (C4–C10):Replace growth media in each ULA plate well with Seahorse assay media. Carefully remove 180 µL of growth media (from 96-well ULA plate) using a P200 pipette, by tilting the plate and angling the pipette tip towards the upper back of the well, avoiding aspiration of spheroids, which will be present in the center of the round bottom ULA well. Each ULA plate well should contain one spheroid.",
    "Inspect wells under the microscope for any loss of spheroids due to the aspiration procedure.Carefully add 200 µL of Seahorse Assay media to each ULA well by slowly pipetting media against the side of the well.Remove 180 µL of Seahorse assay media using a P200 pipette, as in step C4. A multichannel pipette can also be used to perform the washing steps (C3–C5).Repeat steps C3–C5 to ensure that minimal residual sodium bicarbonate from growth medium remains.Note: An additional wash step (C4–C5) can be added if deemed necessary. Remove each spheroid from a ULA well by carefully aspirating it in the remaining liquid (~40 µL) using a P1000 pipette, and transfer it to a well of the Seahorse XFp cell culture miniplate (wells B–G). Observe the ULA well and the XFp miniplate wells under the microscope to ensure successful transfer.Repeat step 8 to transfer the desired number of spheroids per XFp cell culture plate well. The optimal number of spheroids per XFp well should be determined empirically (Figure 2). Let the spheroids settle to bottom and adjust the media volume in the wells to a total of 180 µL.Add 180 µL of Seahorse assay media to wells A & H of the Seahorse XFp cell culture miniplate. Do not add spheroids to these wells, as they are used as a blank reference in the assay.Inspect wells using a microscope and take images with a low magnification objective prior to the assay run (Figure 1). This is to ensure successful transfer of the spheroids in each well, and adjust the number of spheroids if needed, in case of a failed transfer.Place the XFp cell culture miniplate containing spheroids in Seahorse assay media into a humidified 37°C non-CO2 incubator for 60 min prior to the assay, to de-gas the plate.",
    "This ensures diffusion of CO2 from the cells and media, prior to the measurements of O2 and H+ in the assay.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4321/bioprotoc-12-04-4321-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Basal OCR measurements were obtained from the indicated number of spheroids per well, using the Seahorse XFp extracellular flux analyzer. Prior to the assay, spheroids were cultured in ULA plates for either 24 or 72 h (n=2, with mean OCR shown).Seahorse XFp mitochondrial stress testOn the day of the assay, remove the H2O from the hydrated XFp sensor cartridge and replace with 200 µL of prewarmed XF Calibrant. Leave in 37°C humidified non-CO2 incubator until the assay run.Prepare the mitochondrial stress test reagents under sterile conditions (refer to the Recipes section for details). Prepare 300 µL of 10× reagents by diluting the stock solutions with pre-warmed XF assay media to the desired concentrations (see Table 1). The optimal concentrations for Oligomycin and FCCP can be adjusted based on empirical determination for each cell line. It is recommended to determine the optimal concentrations that yield maximal responses by testing a range of final well concentration between 0.125–2 µM of FCCP and between 0.5–2 µM of Oligomycin A.Consult the following method to carry out oligomycin A and FCCP titration assays: https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/New_Cell_Line_Characterization.pdf[href=https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/public/New_Cell_Line_Characterization.pdf].Table 1.

After assigning the experimental groups, click the Protocol page and “Start Assay”.Proceed by following steps D5–6.NormalizationFollowing the completion of the assay, remove the cell culture miniplate and image the spheroids as in step C11, to ensure spheroid integrity and even distribution of spheroids in the assay well post run (Figure 1).Prior to data analysis, choose a method to normalize the results. Examples of data normalization include:Number of spheroids per well. Prior to the assay, equal numbers of spheroids are plated into assay plate wells. This can be achieved by use of 96 well ULA plates to culture spheroids, as these tend to generate a single spheroid per well. Hence, the exact number of desired spheroids/assay well can be accurately transferred into the assay well plate. Post assay, the wells are imaged to count the number of spheroids again, to ensure that no loss or break-up of spheroids occurred during the assay. OCR and ECAR values are then divided by the number of spheroids per assay well and expressed per spheroid (e.g., OCR: pmol/min/spheroid). This method is appropriate when manipulation of experimental parameters is not expected to change spheroid morphology or size, and can be useful when wells vary in spheroid numbers.Number of total cells per well.",
    "This normalization takes into account the total number of cells per spheroid and the total number of spheroids per well. This normalization per cell is an appropriate method when comparing OCR and ECAR values between cells cultured as spheroids and those cultured in attached conditions. The total number of cells is calculated by multiplying the initial seeding density of a single spheroid with the final number of spheroids per XFp well. For comparison to attached conditions, the same total number of cells/well are seeded directly into the Seahorse assay plate. The OCR and ECAR measurement are then expressed per cell (e.g., OCR: pmol/min/cell). This normalization should be carried out to determine if cell density per spheroid affects bioenergetics. If desired, cell counts can be determined again post assay. Spheroids are collected from the assay wells, transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged (500 × g for 5 min), and resuspended in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. Following 5 min incubation at 37°C, and gentle resuspension after 1:1 addition of trypan blue solution, cells are counted using a hemocytometer, or other preferred cell counting method.Protein concentration per well. Spheroids are collected from the assay wells post assay, transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, centrifuged (500 × g for 5 min), media is aspirated, and cells are resuspended in 50 μL of lysis buffer, followed by protein quantification using a preferred method, such as the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) protein assay. The total protein per well is used to normalize the OCR and ECAR measurements across the wells (e.g., OCR: pmol/min/mg protein). For samples with different spheroid sizes, this should be used as the method of normalization.Note: It is recommended to save the cells post-assay to allow for normalization of protein content, in addition to spheroid and cell numbers.",
