    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDesign oligos for LbCas12a guide RNA\nTiming: 1 week\nThis step is required to design a guide RNA that will direct the Cas12a nuclease to a specific site for editing. To demonstrate CRISPR-Cas12a editing in M. oryzae, we mutated the trihydroxynaphthalene reductase encoding gene termed BUF1 (MGG_02252), which is involved in fungal melanin biosynthesis (Chumley and Valent, 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The buf1 deletion mutant showed buff color (i.e., tan/orange) compared with the gray/black mycelial color in the wild-type strain. In this step, we describe the procedure to design the Cas12a guide RNA targeting BUF1.\nDownload the sequence of gene of interest from FungiDB (https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app[href=https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app]). For the BUF1 gene, download the sequence for the gene MGG_02252.\nSearch for the LbCas12a PAM sequences (5′-TTTV-3′) in your gene of interest. Select a 23 bp DNA sequence downstream (3′ end) of PAM as a targeting sequence (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). In the case of BUF1, we designed two spacer/targeting sequences.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1324-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of Cas12a cutting\nBlue line highlights the PAM sequence, the orange line indicates the designed targeting sequence. Arrows indicate the cutting site (17th base after PAM in the non-targeted strand and 22nd base after PAM in the targeted strand) of Cas12a, which is represented by the purple shape. The gRNA contains a hairpin at the 5′ end to facilitate Cas12a interaction.\nBUF1-targeting sequence#1: TTTCTCACCTTCAGCTCACTTCCCCAA\nBUF1-targeting sequence#2: TTTACCATCAACACCCGTGGCCAGTTC\nFirst four bold letters are the PAM, the remaining 23 bp are the targeting sequences.",
    "Note: For LbCas12a guide designing, the targeting sequences must be on the same strand of PAM (‘5-TTTV-3’). V indicates A, C or G, but not T. Previous research reported that targeting sequences with GC-content (∼40%–60%) provides the highest editing activity for Cas12a (Kim et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). We advise avoiding targeting sequences with GC content <30% or >70% (Kim et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCheck the off-target effect by blasting the designed targeting sequences within FungiDB database (https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/search/transcript/UnifiedBlast[href=https://fungidb.org/fungidb/app/search/transcript/UnifiedBlast])\nChoose ‘genome’ as Target Data Type\nChoose ‘blastn’ as BLAST Program\nChoose ‘Pyricularia oryzae 70-15’ as Target organism\nInput 27 bp sequences (4 bp PAM + 23 bp targeting sequences)\nIf the blast result shows the other loci match first 4 bp PAM and at least 16 bp targeting sequences after PAM perfectly, it may cause off-target editing. It is best to discard this potential guide sequence. Otherwise, move forward with the targeting sequence design.\nNote: Pyricularia oryzae is a synonym of Magnaporthe oryzae.\nDesign oligos for preparing the DNA template for in vitro guide RNA synthesis. Two oligos are designed to construct the DNA template.\nUniversal forward oligo including the T7 promoter and LbCas12a mature direct repeat (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1324-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic examples of oligo design\nTarget specific reverse oligo including the reverse complemented sequences of LbCas12a mature direct repeat and the 23 bp targeting sequences you designed for your gene of interest (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Oligos designed for two guides targeting the BUF1 locus, termed BUF1-guide1 and BUF1-guide2, are provided as examples (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: Do not include PAM sequence in your target reverse oligo.\nNote: Various online tools have been developed for genome-wide CRISPR target design. Many are dependent on the organism of interest and must be checked for suitability.",
    "Optional: Commercial guide RNA synthesis kits, compatible with different Cas proteins, are available as an alternative option for preparing gRNA. For example, the NEB EnGen® sgRNA Synthesis Kit for the S. pyogenes SpCas9 protein can be used for making the corresponding gRNA (NEB, Cat#E3322V).\nCritical: If high-quality genome assembly of your isolate is not available, you can check the potential off-target effects of your guides with the commonly used 70-15 genome assembly (Dean et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nIn vitro guide RNA synthesis and RNP assembly\nTiming: 2 days\nFollowing guide RNA design, this step is required to synthesize and associate the guide RNA with the Cas12a protein. This results in a competent RNP ready for transformation.\nGenerate DNA template for in vitro guide RNA synthesis. Set up the below PCR reaction with Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_7.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_8.csv\nCritical: Make sure to use the correct concentration of oligos in the reaction. Products from this step do not require purification. The quality of the amplification reaction can be checked by running 2 μL of PCR product on a 2% agarose gel and visualization. The product should be 66 bp.\nOptional: Ordering the top and bottom oligos with full sequences (i.e., T7 promoter, LbCas12a mature direct repeat and 23 bp targeting sequences), and annealing them as the DNA template would serve as an alternative option to avoid this PCR step.\nGuide RNA in vitro transcription. Set up the transcription as below by using HiScribe™ T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB, Cat#E2040S).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_9.csv\nRun the reaction in a thermocycler with 37°C for 8–18 h.\nNote: Based on our experience, the yield should be at least 50 μg RNA from this step.\nPurification of synthetic guide RNA",
    "Remove the DNA template by adding 1 μL (2 units) RNase-free DNase to the guide RNA reaction and incubate for 15 min at 37°C in a thermocycler.\nPurify the DNase treated guide RNA through Monarch® RNA Cleanup Kit (NEB Cat#T2050L) followed the manufacturer's protocol (https://www.neb.com/protocols/2018/06/28/monarch-rna-cleanup-kit-protocol[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2018/06/28/monarch-rna-cleanup-kit-protocol]).\nQuantify the RNA quality by NanoDrop spectrophotometer. A 260/280 ratio of 2.0–2.2 following guide RNA transcription and purification indicates successful synthesis.\nUse guide RNA immediately for RNP assembly or store at −80°C for up to 2 months.\nAssemble the RNP for one reaction in a 0.2 mL PCR tube as indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_10.csv\nThe amount of gRNA depends on the concentration of gRNA (e.g., if the concentration is 1000 ng/μL, then use x = 0.5 μL for the reaction). Incubate the above reaction for 15 min at 25°C using a thermocycler.\nNote: Add the LbCas12a protein last to avoid protein precipitation (Fernandez et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Assemble the RNP immediately before fungal protoplast transformation.\nDonor DNA preparation\nTiming: 5–6 h\nThis protocol uses donor DNA for selection, which is integrated at the Cas12a DNA double-strand break site. This step is used to amplify and purify the donor DNA prior to transformation.\nAmplify the no-homology HYG DNA donor as indicated below\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_11.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_12.csv",
    "Note: Expected PCR amplification size is 1,466 bp. Each fungal protoplast transformation requires ∼3 μg donor DNA in total. Adjust the number of above PCR reactions based on the total number of transformations you will run. We amplified the HYG DNA donor by using pFGL821 plasmid as DNA template. Other selectable markers (e.g., G418 and Bialaphos) could be used. We amplified G418 coding sequence from plasmid pFGL921 and Bialaphos coding DNA from plasmid pBV9/pSM324 (Kankanala et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Zhang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). If the gene being edited can be directly used for selection, such as editing FKBP12 (Huang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) or URA3/URA5 as has been shown in Fusarium oxysporum for instance (Wang et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]), the inclusion of donor DNA in the experiment is not necessary.\nNote: Selection based on URA3/URA5 has not been established in M. oryzae, and preliminary experiments might be needed to confirm selection based on URA3/URA5 in M. oryzae.\nCheck the amplification quality by running 2 μL of PCR product on a 1% agarose gel. Successful amplification should yield a single product of the expected size.\nPurify the PCR reaction through Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up system (Promega). The detailed purification step follows manufacturer's protocols (https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protocols/technical-bulletins/101/wizard-sv-gel-and-pcr-clean-up-system-protocol.pdf?la=en[href=https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protocols/technical-bulletins/101/wizard-sv-gel-and-pcr-clean-up-system-protocol.pdf?la=en]). If there are more products from the amplification product as indicated by step 10, gel purification can be used to isolate the product of interest by using the same Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up system (Promega).\nQuantify the DNA quality by NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Donor concentration near 200 ng/μL–350 ng/μL is preferred.\nNote: Store the DNA donor in −20°C freezer until future use.\nM. oryzae protoplast preparation\nTiming: 5–6 h",
    "This step is required to generate the necessary M. oryzae cells to be used for transformation. The protoplasts are obtained by degrading the fungal cell wall, and allows more efficient RNP and nucleic acid transfer.\nPrepare the protoplast lysing solution freshly as described in “prepare medium and stock solution[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.1]” section.\nCollect the mycelia from sub-cultured liquid CM through 2-layers of 61/2 in Disks Non Gauze Milk Filter papers and funnel. Wash the collected mycelia with a 5 mL 1×STC solution.\nDry the collected mycelia with extra filter paper, transfer the dry mycelia to 100 mL flask with 25–30 mL protoplast lysing solution. Shake dry mycelia containing the flask at 30°C, 70–80 rpm, for 2.5–3 h under dark to digest the fungal cell wall and release protoplasts.\nNote: When transferring the mycelium, manually separate the mass so it is not a single large mass. This will increase the accessibility to the lysing solution.\nCheck the digestion progress and protoplast quality using a hemocytometer under a dissecting microscope. Successful digestion should release many healthy protoplasts, while if many undigested mycelia are observed, extend the digestion time. However, excessive digestion can also cause protoplast collapse (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1324-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Different protoplast status after lysing enzyme digestion\n(A–C) (A) An example of healthy protoplasts, (B) undigested mycelium, and (C) collapsed protoplasts each highlighted by black circles. Scale Bars = 50 μm\nCollect the protoplast by filtering the above lysing reaction containing the fungal protoplasts, through 2-layer miracloth into pre-chilled, 50 mL falcon tube. Wash the lysing debris left in the miracloth with 1×STC again to collect all the protoplasts.\nCentrifuge the 50mL falcon tube with protoplast at 4°C, 5,000 rpm (i.e., 3,829 g in Beckman Coulter-Allegra 25R centrifuge) for 10 min.\nNote: A visible pellet containing protoplasts should be seen.",
    "Discard the supernatant into a biohazard trash container. Gently resuspend the protoplast using 5–10 mL 1×STC by pipetting or flicking.\nRepeat step 18.\nDiscard the supernatant into a biohazard trash container, and gently resuspend the protoplast in 1mL 1×STC. Quantify the protoplast concentration using a hemocytometer. Add additional 1×STC to adjust the final concentration of protoplasts to 8 × 106 to 5 × 107 protoplasts/mL. Aliquot 200–250 μL protoplast solution to individual 50 mL falcon tubes for further transformation.\nOptional: The protoplasts can be frozen and stored by adding 7% v/v DMSO into the protoplast solution and freezing at −80°C. We recommend performing the protoplast transformation immediately after preparation for best results, but the frozen cultures can still be used for successful editing.\nNote: This protocol is strain independent, and we have used it to make protoplasts for various isolates including O-137 and Guy11 (Bao et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nM. oryzae protoplast transformation\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step transfers the assembled RNP and donor DNA into the fungal cell to allow editing and donor DNA integration.\nSlowly add 20 μL assembled RNP and 3 μg of no-homology HYG DNA donor into the 50 mL falcon tube containing the aliquoted protoplast. Mix the solution by flicking gently. Place the tube at room temperature for 20–25 min.\nNote: If your gene of interest can be used as selection directly, DNA donor is not required in step 22 For example, we have generated fkbp12 (FK506 receptor) mutants by using the selection of drug FK506 without DNA donor successfully (Huang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nSlowly add 1,000 μL PTC solution to the 50 mL falcon tube. Mix the solution by flicking gently. Place the tube at room temperature for 20–25 min.",
    "Slowly add 5 mL liquid TB3 medium into the 50 mL falcon tube. Mix the solution by flicking gently. Cover the 50 mL falcon tube lid with parafilm.\nShake 50 mL falcon tube at 28°C, 90 rpm overnight (12–20 h) in the dark.\nNext day, unseal the 50 mL falcon tube and add melting TB3 medium (near 40 mL for one transformation, 50°C–60°C) with final concentration of 100 μg/mL hygromycin solution. Mix gently, then pour the mixture (overnight protoplast culture + medium) into 150 × 15 mm petri-dish. Wait for about 20 min until complete solidification.\nNote: Protoplasts are fragile and require gentle handling. Other antibiotics corresponding to a different no-homology DNA donor can also be used. For example, we have also used G418 at a final concentration: 300 μg/mL. Bialaphos also can be used at a final concentration: 25 μg/mL in DCM instead of TB3 medium.\nAfter the first selection layer has completely solidified, pour a second layer of melting TB3 medium (near 50 mL) with final concentration of 200 μg/mL hygromycin solution into the 150 × 15 mm petri-dish above the first layer. Wait for about 20 min until complete solidification.\nNote: For G418 selection, the final concentration for the second layer is 600 μg/mL. Bialaphos also can be used at a final concentration: 100 μg/mL in DCM instead of TB3 medium.\nSeal the 150 × 15 mm petri-dish with parafilm and incubate the plate upside down at 28°C for 5–7 days under dark.\nNote: Transformants using M. oryzae isolate O-137 can typically be seen and transferred at 5 days, while those from isolate Guy11 typically take 7 days. Other isolates will have to be empirically determined.",
    "Pick the transformants growing in the top layer for further phenotyping and genotyping. This can be done using a sterile toothpick to move a piece of mycelium to a new plate containing the selection.\nFor BUF1 deletion identification, we cultured the transformants to OTA to check the mycelial color change. For other genes of interest, transformants can be moved to CM with corresponding appropriate selection: 200 μg/mL hygromycin or 500 μg/mL G418. If you use bialaphos selection (final concentration: 100 μg/mL), select DCM instead of CM for screening.\nQuick fungal DNA extraction for genotyping\nTiming: 5–6 h\nDNA is extracted from transformants in order to genotype putative DNA edits.\nPrepare the screw cap tubes with 1.0 mm beads, 400 μL 1M KCL and 400 μL chloroform (added in hood).\nAdd fungal plug (near 1 cm diameter) into the above prepared tubes. (Performed in the biosafety cabinet hood)\nPut the above tubes in a homogenizer with power 4 × 6 cycles (30 s each cycle) to disrupt the fungal material.\nCentrifuge 13,200 rpm (i.e.,16,100 g in Eppendorf 5415D centrifuge) × 10 min\nTransfer 200 μL supernatant into new labeled tubes\nAdd 120 μL isopropanol in the tube, mix well to precipitate the DNA for at least 10 min (added in hood).\nCentrifuge 13,200 rpm (i.e.,16,100 g in Eppendorf 5415D centrifuge) × 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 500 μL 75% ethanol.\nCentrifuge 13,200 rpm (i.e.,16,100 g in Eppendorf 5415D centrifuge) × 10 min.\nDiscard the ethanol and air dry for 10 min.\nAdd 50 μL sterilized water to dissolve the DNA pellet.",
    "Note: We prefer to use 1 μL of the dissolved DNA as template for PCR amplification. The DNA extracted by this quick extraction protocol is sufficient for PCR genotyping but should not be considered adequate for other uses such as next-generation sequencing or southern blot.\nPCR genotyping\nUsing the extracted DNA, PCR is used to determine if the gene of interest has been mutated by amplifying multiple regions at the target locus. This allows the researcher to understand and identify a range of possible DNA mutations, including INDELS, donor DNA insertions, and large deletions.\nWe prefer to design three pairs of primer for genotyping; one primer pair amplifies within the gene of interest (∼1–2 kb for PCR amplification, the RNP targeting sequence should be included in this amplifying region), and the other two primer pairs amplifying the 5′ and 3′ regions of the targeted sequence (∼ 0.5 kb for PCR amplification, the reverse primer for 5′ upstream amplification and the forward primer for 3′ downstream amplification should locate closely (1–200 bp) to the start codon and stop codon of the gene of interest) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1324-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic illustration of PCR primer pairs used for genotyping\nPerform genotyping PCR followed the below program for the gene of interest. We used the BUF1 gene as an example.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_13.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_14.csv\nNote: The expected amplification size for wild-type is 1,648 bp, the size for mutants might vary based on the mutation pattern (Huang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nPerform genotyping PCR for 5′upstream, 3′ downstream of BUF1 and ACTIN (loading control) with below program\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_15.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1324_16.csv\nNote: Annealing temperature for BUF1 5′ upstream or downstream is 54°C, while it requires 57°C for ACTIN. The expected amplification size for BUF1 upstream, downstream and ACTIN is 311 bp, 458 bp and 503 bp, respectively."
