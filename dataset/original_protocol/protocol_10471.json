    "1. Preparation of TiO2-coated Glass Coverslip\nNumber the coverslips using a diamond scriber. This helps not only to keep track of each coverslips but also to ensure that the correct side of the sample is facing up. Clean the coverslips, first under running ddH2O, then by immersing them in piranha solution (H2SO4:H2O2 = 4:1). After 10 min, rinse the coverslips thoroughly, 8 times in ddH2O. Dry the coverslips under N2 flow.\nSet TiO2 target in the radio-frequency (RF) sputtering system. Attach the coverslips onto a sample holder of the sputtering equipment using a polyimide tape. Place the sample holder in the sputtering chamber. Evacuate the chamber until the pressure reaches 2.0×10-4 Pa.\nIntroduce Ar gas into the chamber and set the deposition pressure to 4.0 mTorr. While keeping the shutter closed, gradually increase the RF power to 70 W.\nOpen the shutter and sputter for 15 min to obtain a film with a thickness of 120-150 nm (Figure 1: Step A). Growth rate of the film needs to be derived for each machine.\n2. Surface Coating with Cell-repellent Film\nHydrophilize the TiO2 surface by treating the sample with O2 plasma, following instructions provided by the manufacturer of the plasma reactor. We treat the sample for 5 min at 200 W with O2 flow of 100 sccm. Immerse the sample in ddH2O and confirm that the surface is superhydrophilic. Dry the surface thoroughly under N2 flow.\nPrepare 1 mM octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) solution by adding 39.6 μl OTS to 100 ml toluene. Immerse the sample in the solution for 1 hr at RT. Conduct this step inside an N2-filled glove bag (Figure 1: Step B).",
    "To remove physisorbed molecules, sonicate the sample in toluene, acetone, ethanol, and ddH2O for 5 min each, in that order. Rinse the sample four times in fresh ddH2O and dry the surface under N2 flow. The surface should be hydrophobic with a contact angle of 100-110°.\n3. Ex-Situ Surface Patterning\nWorking in a laminar flow hood, draw several scratch marks with a diamond scriber on the surface. The marks help in keeping track of the processed regions and also bringing microscopes into focus. Sterilize the OTS-coated TiO2 by immersing the sample in 70% ethanol for 5 min. Then rinse the sample twice in sterilized ddH2O.\nPlace the sample in a 35-mm dish, and add 2 ml of PC12 growth medium (see Step 4.2). Incubate for over 3 hr in a CO2 incubator (37 °C). This procedure is intended to let serum albumins absorb onto the surface. Adsorbed albumins inhibit subsequent adsorption of other proteins and cells (Figure 1: Step C).\nWhile waiting, set up the inverted fluorescence microscope.\n\t\nTurn on the arc lamp, insert the UV filter cube, and set the objective lens to 20X.\nMeasure light intensity I (W cm-2) using an UV-intensity meter, and calculate irradiation time t (in seconds) for a dose of d (in J cm-2) as: t = d/I.\n\t\tFor instance, to irradiate at a dose of 200 J cm-2 using a light source of 600 mW cm-2, 333 sec of irradiation is required.\nUse a stage micrometer and close the field diaphragm to set the size of the region to be irradiated, e.g., 200 μm.\nAfter the 3 hr incubation, supplement the medium with 200 μl of 3.0 mg ml-1 type-IV collagen (Col-IV; final concentration 300 μg ml-1).",
    "Transfer the 35-mm dish to the microscope stage. Find the scratch mark, focus the microscope onto the sample surface, and irradiate UV-light at a dose of 200 J cm-2 (Figure 1: Step D). The area of UV irradiation can be altered either by adjusting the opening of the field diaphragm or by replacing the field diaphragm with a metal mask of arbitral geometry.\nReplace the medium with a fresh growth medium (without Col-IV), and place the sample back in the incubator.\n4. Cell Culture\nRoutine culture of PC12 cells is carried out on a collagen-coated plastic dish.\n\t\nTo coat a 60-mm tissue-culture dish with Col-IV, first wet the surface with ddH2O and aspirate all ddH2O.\nPrepare 300 μg ml-1 Col-IV by diluting the original solution (3 mg ml-1) 10x with ddH2O.\nAdd 200 μl of 300 μg ml-1 Col-IV per 60-mm dish. Let the solution spread through the surface.\nDry the dish in a laminar flow hood for approximately 1 hr.\nRinse the surface twice with 4 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS). When not using the coated dish immediately, rinse the dish once with 4 ml of ddH2O. After aspirating ddH2O, store the dish in the incubator. Try not to keep it stored for more than two weeks.\nPC12 cells are grown in a growth medium that consists of: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) + 10% fetal bovine serum + 5% horse serum + 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Incubate the cells in a CO2 incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2), and replace half of the medium every other day. Passage cells before they reach confluence.",
    "Aspirate the growth medium, and add 2 ml of PBS+ (D-PBS + 10 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin (BSA) + 10 mM EDTA) prewarmed to 37 °C. Incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. Gently tap the dish to detach all cells.\nCollect cells in a 15 ml conical tube. Rinse the dish with 3 ml of fresh D-PBS, prewarmed to 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the tube at 150 × g for 4 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, and add 1 ml of the growth medium.\nFor routine culture, split the cells 1:3 to 1:5.\nTo plate cells on the UV-modified OTS/TiO2 sample, count cell density and add 3.0×105 cells in a 35-mm dish (Figure 1: Step E). Incubate the dish in the humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 1-2 days. Both naive and nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells can be used for the patterning experiments. For NGF differentiation, 100 ng ml-1 of 7S-NGF is added to the growth medium several days before plating the cells onto the sample. NGF-differentiation seems to increase the adhesibility of the PC12 cells and makes handling easier, especially in the in-situ patterning experiments.\n5. In-Situ Surface Patterning\nAfter 1-2 days of culture on the ex-situ modified surface, confirm that the cells are attaching and growing only on the UV-irradiated region. Set up the microscope, as described in Step 3.4.\nTransfer the sample to a new 35-mm tissue culture dish containing the growth medium, 100 ng ml-1 NGF (in the case of using NGF-differentiated cells), and 100 μg ml-1 Col-IV.\nPlace the dish on the microscope stage. Find the appropriate position, and irradiate UV light at a dose of 200 J cm-2 (Figure 1: Step F, G). The newly created permissive region is indicated with an asterisk in Figure 1: Step G.",
    "Try to complete processing of a single sample within 30 min. After irradiation, transfer the sample back into the medium without Col-IV.\nBe extremely careful when carrying the dish with cultured cells and transferring the sample from dish to dish to prevent detaching of the patterned cells.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53045/53045fig1highres.jpg\nFigure 1.
