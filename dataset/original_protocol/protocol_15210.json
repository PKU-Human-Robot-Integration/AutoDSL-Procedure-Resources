    "1. Tissue Processing and Digestion\nObtain human mammary tissue as discard material from surgical procedures. Reduction mammoplasties can provide normal or benign cells; fibroadenomas and gynecomastias provide benign cells; non-tumor mastectomy tissues (peripheral or contralateral to a tumor, or subcutaneous) provide cells that may range from normal to benign to containing microtumors. Ensure proper IRB approval exists prior to obtaining the discard material. All material should be treated under bloodborne pathogen regulations.\nPlace material in sterile containers containing buffer or media (e.g. 1:1 Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and Ham's F-12) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml Fungizone, 50U/ml polymyxin B, and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, and transport to laboratory at 4 °C. Reduction mammoplasty tissue can be stored or shipped at 4 °C for 72 hr without significantly affecting subsequent cell viability. Small pieces of non-reduction mammoplasty tissue may require more prompt processing.\nSeparate the epithelial areas from the stromal matrix of adipose tissue, connective tissue and blood vessels using a combination of sterile scalpel, forceps and scissors. Cut pieces of tissue with scissors and place in a large glass sterile dish (e.g., 150 mm). Gently dissect out the epithelial areas, which appear as white strands embedded in the yellower stromal matrix, using the forceps to hold the material and the scalpel to scrape away the grossly fatty material. To facilitate digestion, cut the epithelial tissue into smaller pieces of ~3-4 mm using opposing scalpels and place into a 50 ml test tube. If large amounts of tissue are being processed, fresh scalpel blades may be needed. Remove fatty material from the dish for disposal according to institutional regulations.",
    "In heavily fibrous tissues (e.g., subcutaneous mastectomies with severe fibrocystic disease), there will be more solid white, non-epithelial material. It may be difficult to dissect out the epithelial cells from such fibrous matrices. Large pieces of fibrous material can be cut into smaller pieces that are ~1-3 mm square in area and digested separately.\nPlace the dissected epithelial tissue into a conical centrifuge tube (50 ml or 15 ml) with the tissue comprising no greater than one third of the volume of the tube. Bring the tube up to full volume, leaving only a small air space to allow for mixing during rotation, using a tissue digestion mixture (DME/F-12 or equivalent, 10 μg/ml insulin, antibiotics as above, and final concentration of 10% FCS, 200 U/ml crude collagenase and 100 U/ml hyaluronidase.\nPlace tubes on a HulaMixer tube rotator and rotate 360° at 8 rpm overnight at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge tubes at 600 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant fat and medium for disposal according to institutional regulations.\nCheck for completion of digestion by diluting a small aliquot of the pellet in medium. Digestion is complete when microscopic examination shows clumps of cells (organoids) with smooth-appearing ductal, alveolar, or ductal-alveolar structures free from attached stroma (Figure 1A). Reduction mammoplasty tissues will usually still show attached stroma after an overnight digestion and will require additional digestion time.\n\t\nResuspend the incompletely digested pellet in fresh tissue digestion mixture and re-incubate with rotation at 37 °C for another 4-12 hr. Repeat steps 1.6 and 1.7. If digestion is still incomplete, again add digestion mixture to the pellet and re-incubate with rotation at 37 °C overnight. The concentration of enzymes may be reduced to prevent over-digestion overnight.",
    "When digestion is complete, centrifuge tubes at 600 x g for 5 min, aspirate the digestion mix, resuspend pellet in medium plus antibiotics at approximately 15 ml/50 ml tube, 5 ml/15 ml tube.\n2. Filtration and Freezing of Digested Material\nTransfer aliquots of the resuspended pellet onto a sterile 100 μm strainer over a sterile 50 ml tube. Let the medium drain into the tube, then rewash the organoids on top 1-2x times with 2-3 ml of medium. Repeat until all of the resuspended pellet has been transferred. If there are too many organoids on the filter and the medium no longer drains easily, use a new filter(s) for the remaining material. Carefully flip the filter(s) on top of another sterile tube and wash the organoids into the tube with more medium. This is the 100 μm organoid pool.\nTake the material that drained into the original 50 ml tube and repeat the process of 2.1 using a 40 μm strainer, to obtain the 40 μm organoid pool, which contains mostly alveolar structures. The material that drained into the tube constitutes the filtrate pool, which contains single/small clumps of mesenchymal and epithelial cells and small pieces of the vasculature.\nPellet the 100 μm, 40 μm, and filtrate pools at 600 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant, reconstitute each tube in CPM II (DME/F-12 or equivalent with 44% FCS and 6% DMSO) using approximately 1 ml of CPMII per 0.1 ml of packed pellet. Keep at 4 °C.",
    "Seed a test dish for the 2 organoid pools by placing 0.1 ml of resuspended material into a 35 mm tissue culture plastic dish drop by drop as in 3.2 below. The filtrate pool can be directly seeded onto tissue culture plastic with fibroblast medium (DME/F-12 or equivalent with 10 μg/ml insulin and 10% FBS).\nAliquot the remaining resuspended material into Nunc type freezing ampoules (1 ml/2 ml ampoule). Freeze overnight at -80 °C and then transfer promptly to storage in liquid nitrogen. We have not observed any significant loss of viability in our original ampoules stored frozen since the late 1970's.\n3. Seeding Frozen Organoids and Subculture of Primary Cultures\nQuickly thaw the frozen ampoule containing the organoids in a 37 °C water bath. Seed the organoids into 2 to 10 (usually ~6) 60 mm dishes, or 1-3 100 mm dishes, depending upon visual estimation of the number of organoids in the ampoule. Approximately 20-40 organoids seeded per 60 mm dish is optimal.\nThawed organoids are carefully placed, drop by drop, onto the dish surface with a 1 ml pipette or Pasteur pipette for an even distribution of organoids. Organoids placed close together will have limited space for outgrowth, giving rise to fewer cells for subculture or freezing. Avoid scratching the dish surface (cells tend not to grow past scratched surfaces). Wait 1-2 min to allow the organoids to attach and then slowly add growth medium to avoid dislodging the organoids (e.g. 2-3 ml/60 mm dish). Incubate at 37 °C in humidified CO2 incubator. These are the primary cultures. We currently use M87A+oxytocin(X) medium for the most robust HMEC growth (Figure 2).",
    "After 1 day, check that the organoids are attached. Add additional medium (e.g. 2-3 ml/60 mm dish). Cell migration from the organoids should be visible by 24-48 hr, and mitotic outgrowth by 48-72 hr after seeding (Figure 1B,C). Sometimes attachment is poor after 24 hr, particularly if plating overdigested organoids or organoids from older women, but most preparations will attach within 72 hr. Small pieces of the vasculature may attach and give rise to fibroblast cell outgrowth (Figure 1D).\nFeed cultures at least 3 times per week. Cells grown in M87A-type media grow to near confluence within 5-8 days, depending upon density of seeding.\nIf there is significant fibroblast growth, Differential Trypsinization (DT), based on the rapid detachment of fibroblasts from the surface plastic, is needed to remove the fibroblasts. When the epithelial patches become large, aspirate media, wash dish (e.g., 1-2 ml/60 mm dish) with STE (saline, 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA), aspirate, add fresh 0.5 ml STE and leave at room temperature for around 1 min with continuous microscopic observation. When the fibroblasts detach but the epithelial cells are still adherent, gently but sharply knock the side of the dish against a hard surface to dislodge the fibroblasts and then quickly aspirate. Wash once with PBS, and aspirate again. Cultures heavily contaminated with fibroblasts may need an additional DT.\nSubculture primary cultures when large epithelial patches are present, but before confluence. The density of organoid seeding and attachment will influence the time required. To retain the primary culture and to generate multiple secondary cultures, spaced over time, we perform Partial Trypsinizations (PT).",
    "Aspirate media, wash a 60 mm dish with 1-2 ml STE, add 0.5 ml fresh STE to dish. Observe cell detachment under the microscope at room temperature for 1-5 min, with gentle knocking of the dish to promote cell detachment. Trypsinization should be stopped when ~50% of the cells have detached. Early PTs usually have rapid cell detachment. For later PTs, cells can be placed at 37 °C for faster detachment, with careful monitoring, as all the cells may come off quickly.\nAdd 2 ml of serum-containing media to the dish, repipette to wash, and transfer to a sterile 15 ml tube. Repeat 2x with another ~1-2 ml media, adding the wash to the tube. Refeed the primary dish and return to incubator. Count the cells in the tube with the haemocytometer. PTs can be repeated around 4 to 8 times with good cell regrowth in the primary dishes and equivalent long-term growth from the subcultured or frozen secondaries (second passage cells are called secondaries; once subcultured, cells are no longer primaries). Once organoid material is no longer present in the primary cultures, subcultured secondaries show a decline in long-term population doubling potential.\nFor subculture to secondaries, seed cells directly from the tube into dishes. Seeding of 1-2 x 105 cells/100 mm dish in a robust medium such as M87A+X will lead to confluence in 4-7 days. We add cholera toxin to the medium at second passage to increase proliferative potential; cholera toxin is omitted in primary culture because it leads to multilayered cell outgrowth from the organoids.",
    "For freezing as secondaries, pellet tube at 600 x g for 5 min, and resuspend in CPMII with a final density of 106 cells/ml. Aliquot resuspended cells into Nunc type freezing ampoules, freeze overnight at -80 °C and then transfer promptly to storage in liquid nitrogen.\nIt is recommended to freeze cells from the first PT for safekeeping, and use cells from the second PT for subculture. Additional PTs can be stored frozen for future use."
