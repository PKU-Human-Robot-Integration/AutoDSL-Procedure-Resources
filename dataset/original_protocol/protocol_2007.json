Maintain at 28°C.\nAnalyze the phenotypes daily for four days following the transfections as indicated in step 10 (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).

    "(A and B) Deficient tcDAC2 cells present an abnormal phenotype with only one kinetoplast and multiple nuclei and flagella (A) suggesting proliferation defects and genome instability corroborated by the abnormal profile observed by cell cycle analysis (B). Cyan curves show wild-type cell profile and red and yellow line curves show mutant cell profiles. dpt – days post-transfection."
