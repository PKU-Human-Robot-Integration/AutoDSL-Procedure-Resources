  "procedures": [
    "This protocol has been approved by the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #22339) and the UC Davis Institutional Biosafety Committee (BUA-R1903). This protocol has been tested on C57BL/6J mice of both sexes at postnatal day 0-1.\n1. Clone the enhancer candidate sequence into the AAV vector plasmid.\nNOTE: The representative protocols are given, but the cloning strategy has a high degree of flexibility.\nSelect or design a reporter construct. Here, the enhancer candidate is inserted into the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the EGFP reporter gene, which is expressed under the control of the Hsp68 minimal promoter.\n\tNOTE: Many MPRA plasmid constructs appropriate for this assay have been deposited to Addgene41 and are available for research use.\nDesign PCR primers to amplify a sequence of interest. Add to the 5' end of the primers the appropriate homology arm for Gibson cloning (~35 bp corresponding to sequence 5' upstream of the insertion location, top strand for the forward primer, and bottom strand for the reverse primer).\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the base primer sequence is ~18-24 bp long and ~50%-60% GC content with a melting temperature of approximately 57-59 °C.\nPerform PCR from a DNA sample using the designed primers.\n\t\nAssemble the PCR reaction mix in 0.2 mL PCR tubes as described in Table 1.\nPlace the PCR reaction mix(es) on a thermal cycler and cycle according to the program mentioned in Table 1.\nConfirm the success of PCR by running 5 µL of PCR product on a 0.7%-1% agarose gel at 100 V for 30-60 min. Check for the fragment of predicted length.\nCleanup the PCR product using a commercial enzymatic reaction cleanup column kit. The final eluate is the cloning insert.",
    "Perform restriction digestion to linearize the AAV vector at the unique cloning site to insert the enhancer into the vector.\n\t\nThe cloning site in the 3' UTR of the enhancer reporter construct used here is bounded by unique PacI and AscI restriction sites. Perform a digest to linearize the plasmid at this location according to the following parameters (steps 1.4.2-1.4.4).\nDigest 1-10 µg of vector DNA using PacI and AscI, depending on how many cloning reactions will be needed. Prepare the reactions using the supplied buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 1-2 h to digest the vector DNA. (If digesting more than 5 µg in a 50 µL reaction, longer incubation may be necessary.)\nAfter 1-2 h of incubation, inactivate the enzyme by incubating at 65 °C for 20 min.\nSeparate the restriction digest fragments by gel electrophoresis using a 0.7%-1% agarose gel, run at 100 V for 30-60 min.\nExcise the band for the linearized vector and purify using a commercial gel extraction kit.\nPerform Gibson cloning reactions and transform\n\t\nDetermine the concentration of the purified vector and the cloning insert using a spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: DNA absorbs light at 260 nm, while contaminants absorb light at 230 nm and 280 nm. High ratios (>1.8) of 260/230 and 260/280 indicate highly purified DNA.\nAssemble Gibson cloning reactions in 0.2 mL PCR tubes: 5 µL of 2x Gibson master mix, 0.02-0.5 pmol DNA fragments in a ratio of 3:1 insert to vector (Optimal DNA concentration for the reaction should be determined empirically) and Nuclease-free water (bring up the volume to 10 µL).\nIncubate Gibson reactions at 50 °C for 20 min in a thermal cycler.\nTransform recombination deficient (recA-) competent Escherichia coli (E. coli).",
    "Set a water bath to 42 °C and thaw the commercially available competent cells on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: This step can be done prior to step 1.4, and the cells can thaw while preparing and incubating the Gibson reaction.\nAliquot 30-50 µL of cells into 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Add 2 µL of Gibson reaction to an aliquot and label the tube with the identity of the Gibson. Incubate the cells on ice for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Use 5-10 ng of undigested empty vector as a positive control and water as a negative control.\nHeat-shock the cells in the 42 °C water bath for 30-45 s, immediately return the tubes to ice, and let them recover for 5 min.\nWhile on ice, add 400-950 µL of the commercially available recovery media.\n\t\tNOTE: The recovery media used in these experiments contains 2% vegetable peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgSO4, and 20 mM glucose.\nAfter recovery on ice, fully recover the cells by incubating at 37 °C with gentle agitation of 250 RPM for 30-60 min.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 5 min and remove 400 µL of the supernatant, leaving ~50 µL of bacteria to plate.\nPlate on selective media and incubate at 37 °C overnight.",
    "NOTE: The selective media used in these experiments contains 1.0% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1.0% sodium chloride, 1-2% agar, 96-97% water, and carbenicillin at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. Always use recombination deficient strains of bacteria for cloning viral plasmids because the viral inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) have matching sequences and can undergo homologous recombination. However, recA- strains of bacteria still undergo low levels of recombination. The reporter plasmid used here is a self-complementary AAV, where the sequence of one of the ITRs has been altered and no longer perfectly matches the other ITR. Growing the bacteria at 30 °C is also recommended for further slowing the rate of homologous recombination.\nVerify clones and recover plasmids.\n\t\nPrepare a PCR master mix using forward and reverse primers (Table of Materials) that anneal to the vector, flanking the insert location. Aliquot 10 µL volumes into 0.2 mL PCR strip tubes.\nIn 14 mL round-bottom tubes, prepare 5 mL aliquots of antibiotic selective LB broth, one for each colony being tested via PCR and negative control.\nUse a sterile toothpick or pipette tip to pick an individual colony and roughly scrape the colony down into the bottom of one PCR tube.\nWhen the colony has dissociated into the PCR master mix, drop the toothpick or tip into one of the LB aliquots and label the 14 mL tube with the Gibson reaction and the PCR tube number.\nPlace the colony PCR reactions on a thermal cycler and cycle with the program described in Table 2.\nIncubate the 5 mL liquid cultures inoculated with toothpicks or pipette tips in a shaking incubator set to 37 °C and 180 RPM.",
    "Run the colony PCR reactions on a 0.7%-1% agarose gel at 100 V for 30-60 min and visualize the bands in a gel doc imaging system.\nDiscard the 5 mL cultures that do not display the predicted PCR band.\nFor each successfully integrated clone, allow the 5 mL cultures to grow overnight and then perform a plasmid mini prep from 4.5 mL using a commercial kit. Reserve 0.5 mL of the liquid culture and save at -80 °C as a glycerol stock.\nConfirm that the transgenes contained within the plasmids are free of undesirable mutations using Sanger sequencing42.\nAfter the reporter construct has been confirmed to be successfully cloned, use the saved glycerol stock to inoculate a 5 mL starter culture and grow for 8-16 h in a shaking incubator at 30 °C and 180 RPM.\nOnce the broth is cloudy, dilute the starter culture 1,000x in 250-300 mL of fresh selective LB broth and incubate at least overnight in a shaking incubator at 30 °C and 180 RPM. Then purify the plasmid using a commercial plasmid maxi kit.\n\t\tNOTE: Bacteria will grow more slowly at 30 °C compared to 37 °C, but this is the best temperature for slowing the rate of spontaneous recombination when growing large cultures.\nPerform an XmaI digest to test for recombination of the ITRs using steps 1.4.2-1.4.5, substituting XmaI instead of PacI and AscI. Visualize the bands on a gel doc imaging system.",
    "​NOTE: An rAAV plasmid with both ITRs present will yield two bands on a gel following this digest: one the length of the rAAV genome and the other the length of the rest of the plasmid backbone. If there is only one band, then the ITRs have undergone homologous recombination, and the rAAV plasmid will not be capable of packaging viral particles. The rAAV plasmid backbone described here has been designed so that XmaI sites only occur in the ITRs. If the enhancer candidate insert also contains any XmaI sites, update the predicted band results and analysis accordingly.\n2. Obtain packaged rAAV.\nUse packaged rAAV (professionally or in-house) for the experiments in this study.\n\tNOTE: There are many options for packaging an rAAV. An rAAV can be professionally packaged at a company or a university core facility. The rAAV can also be packaged in-house using different techniques that range in complexity and need for specialized equipment43,44. The primary concern is obtaining a vector that is high quality and that the infectious titer has been determined to a high degree of certainty. Both professionally packaged and in-house packaged rAAVs were used for different experiments described in this study.\n3. Intracranially inject rAAV-packaged plasmid into neonatal mice.\nPrepare rAAV mixture for delivery.\n\t\nIf the intent is to compare the expression patterns between different enhancer reporter viruses, equalize the titers of all viruses to be compared by diluting all to match the least concentrated virus.\nMix together a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of enhancer reporter virus and constitutively expressed control reporter virus and add a small amount (0.06% final concentration) of Fast Green dye.",
    "NOTE: Fast Green is a dye that is used widely in injections of experimental animals, including with AAV, to visualize the injection site during and immediately after the procedure45,46,47,48. While this is an important quality assurance step, it is possible that the addition of dye could interfere with transduction. Reconsidering the use of injection dye may be important for protocol optimization in certain cases. The constitutively driven control virus is absolutely critical for comparing independent injections. Virus injections will vary in location and extent of transduction from animal to animal. The constitutive control will enable excluding failed injections from analysis and provide a standard for normalization of variation in virus delivery.\nBreak the tip of a sterile pulled glass pipette made from a μL-graduated capillary tube by gently piercing it through a delicate wipe sterilized by soaking it in 70% ethanol and allowed to dry completely. Then insert the pulled glass pipette into the aspirator assembly consisting of a device for applying pressure connected to 15-inch long rubber tubing ending with a rubber gasket for holding a micro-capillary pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: The \"device for applying pressure\" may be a syringe or a mouthpiece. If a syringe is to be used, a second person will be required to apply pressure through the syringe while the experimenter manipulates the pipette in one hand and the animal in the other. If using a mouthpiece, enabling the experimenter fine control over both the positions of the animal and pipette and the pressure applied to the syringe, extra care to avoid virus contamination is required.\nApply negative pressure through the aspirator assembly to draw a small volume (~0.2-0.5 µL) of mineral oil into the glass pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is very important to provide a barrier to prevent aerosolized viral particles from contaminating the aspirator assembly.",
    "Set the prepared aspirator assembly aside and keep the virus on ice until ready to inject.\nCryo-anesthetize the neonatal mice in a dry plastic dish partially submerged in ice until the cessation of the pedal withdrawal reflex (~5 min). Ensure that the mice are not in direct contact with the ice.\nUse negative pressure through the aspirator assembly to draw the virus mixture into the pulled glass pipette until the meniscus passes the 2 µL tick mark.\nRemove the mouse from the cold chamber and position it on the benchtop. Locate the bilateral injection sites midway between lambda and bregma and midway between the sagittal suture and each eye. Sanitize both areas with an alcohol wipe.\nUse the pulled glass pipette to pierce the skull of the neonatal mice and gently apply positive pressure through the aspirator assembly as the needle enters the brain. Watch the meniscus of the virus mixture. Resistance to the pressure applied will decrease when the tip of the pipette reaches the lateral ventricle. Dispense 1 µL of the virus, withdraw the pipette, and repeat for the other lateral ventricle.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad or a warming chamber to recover. Once awake and active, return the animal to its home cage.\n4. Collect tissue and perform immunohistochemistry.\nAfter sufficient time following virus transduction, anesthetize the mice and sacrifice by transcardial perfusion.\n\tNOTE: Many experiments, including the representative results shown here, allow a period of 4 weeks or longer for the virus to transduce. However, self-complementary AAVs can show strong expression as early as 7 days12. The desired incubation period may need to be optimized depending on specific experimental techniques and goals.\n\t\nPrepare a peristaltic pump with intravenous infusion tubing and a 25 G needle.",
    "Prepare 1x PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and place them on ice.\nPlace the intake end of the tubing in the ice-cold 1x PBS. Set the flow rate (2.5 mL/min for P7 mice, 3.5 mL/min for P28 mice) and run the pump until the buffer is drawn all the way through the tubing and is cleared of bubbles. Set the needle aside until ready for perfusion.\nInside a fume hood, pipette a small volume of isoflurane onto a paper towel in the bottom of a drop jar chamber. Place the previously injected mouse onto a grate above the paper towel, ensuring it does not come into direct contact with the isoflurane. Seal the chamber to anesthetize the mouse. Wait for ~5 min and then open the chamber and check for a pedal withdrawal reflex. Proceed once the animal is unconscious.\n\t\tNOTE: Throughout the perfusion, the mouse should be maintained on isoflurane with a nose cone to prevent regaining consciousness.\nUse surgical scissors to open the abdomen and chest of the mouse, remove the rib cage and expose the heart.\nUse a pair of iris micro scissors to make a small incision in the mouse's right atrium, insert the IV needle into the left ventricle, and activate the peristaltic pump.\nPerfuse the animal with ice-cold 1x PBS until the blood flushing out of the incision in the right atrium runs clear. Clearing the tissue of blood is very important because red blood cells have autofluorescence, and blood vessels may impair the ability to image reporter-expressing cells.\nPause the peristaltic pump and move the intake tubing from the PBS to the 4% PFA. Reactivate the pump and perfuse 1 mL/g of body weight, ~25 mL for an adult mouse.",
    "NOTE: Fixation tremors should be observable, and the body of the mouse should stiffen.\nDissect and post-fix the brain.\n\t\nRemove the mouse's head with surgical scissors.\nUsing small surgical scissors, start at the base of the skull and make an incision along the midline of the head and pull back the skin and underlying tissue to expose the skull.\nUsing iris scissors, carefully cut the back of the skull, starting at the foramen magnum and continuing up toward and along the sagittal suture until the olfactory bulbs are passed.\nInsert the scissors into the skull over the olfactory bulbs and make two horizontal cuts in the skull. Make a similar pair of horizontal cuts in the occipital bone. The horizontal and midline cuts create a pair of door-like flaps in the top of the skull.\nPeel back the flaps of the skull to fully expose the brain. Use a pair of tweezers to sever the olfactory bulbs from the skull and to cut the cranial nerves, freeing the brain from the skull.\nDrop the brain into a 15 mL conical tube with 3-5 mL of 4% PFA in PBS. Post-fix 6 h to overnight. Do not over-fix the tissue.\nPrepare the brains for cryosectioning.\n\t\nTransfer the fixed brain to a new 15 mL conical tube with 12-14 mL of 30% sucrose in PBS for dehydration. Incubate at 4 °C until the brain sinks to the bottom of the tube (2-3 days).\nSubmerge the fixed and dehydrated brain in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound in a 15 mm x 15 mm x 5 mm cryomold. Add OCT until the brain is fully covered.\nPlace cryomold on a block of dry ice and freeze the sample in a solid block of OCT (~ 5 min).",
    "NOTE: OCT blocks can be stored at -80 °C for months to years.\nLabel the cryomold with the sample name and the orientation of the brain.\nObtain coronal sections using a cryostat microtome.\n\t\nMark the orientation of the brain on the OCT block in pencil and remove the block from the cryomold inside the cryostat.\nPosition the OCT block so that the brain is oriented with the olfactory bulbs facing the blade of the cryostat and adhere the block to the object holder of the cryostat with some fresh OCT.\nOnce frozen in place, begin cutting 50 µm sections through the block following steps 4.4.4-4.4.6.\nDo not use the anti-roll plate. Sections will curl into tight rolls as they are cut and will collect either on top of the block or fall below into a collection tray.\nWatch the shape of the block in the first few cuts that are made. Make vertical cuts through the block, producing an even face when beginning to cut. Adjust the angle using the sample adjustment arms if needed.\nWhen the olfactory bulbs are visible, pay close attention to the shape of the sections. If one appears larger than the other, the cuts are at an angle relative to the brain, and it is necessary to straighten the orientation of the brain against the blade using the sample adjustment arms.\n\t\tNOTE: If cutting straight, the cortex should begin to appear above each olfactory bulb at the same time.\nOnce the olfactory bulb has been sectioned and rostral brain tissue is visible, reduce the cutting thickness to 30-35 µm and begin to collect the floating sections. Follow steps 4.4.8-4.4.13 for sectioning the brain.",
    "Brush all previous sections off of the block and object holder so that they fall into the collecting tray. Brush them off to one side of the tray and keep them separate. If the pile is too big, then empty the tray.\nDispense 1 mL of PBS into each well of a 24 well plate. Label 1 row for each brain.\nCut 6 coronal sections. Retrieve the sections using cold tweezers and arrange them on the cryostat stage. Repeat this step 2 or 3 times, keeping the groups of 6 sections separate.\nWet a size 000 paintbrush with PBS and dab away excess liquid on a lint-free tissue or paper towel. Use the paintbrush to gently pick up each section, one at a time, and place it in the appropriate wells of the 24 well plate.\nPlace one of the 6 sections from the group of slices into each of the 6 wells in a row of the 24 well plate. This ensures that each well contains representative sections that span the sectioned area of the brain.\nContinue sectioning in groups of 6 until the caudal end of the cerebral cortex has been sectioned.\nFor storage, seal the 24 well plate with parafilm and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Sections are stable for 1-2 months at 4 °C. A PBS solution with 0.1% Sodium azide may be used to inhibit bacterial growth and prolong the shelf life of the sections. However, if the sections are to be stored for longer than 2 months, they should be placed in cryoprotectant solution and frozen at -20 °C for best results.\nPerform immunohistochemistry for reporter gene signal amplification.",
    "NOTE: All steps except antigen retrieval should be performed using gentle-to-moderate agitation (~100 RPM) on an orbital shaker.To preserve native fluorescence of the control reporter (mRuby3), all steps should be protected from light as much as possible.\n\t\nPrepare necessary buffers as described in Table 3.\nPrepare a new 24 well plate with one row for each brain being stained. In the first column of wells, add 1 mL of PBS to each well.\nUsing a size 000 paintbrush, gently transfer 1 well of sections from the original collection well to the fresh PBS in the new 24 well plate for a quick rinse to remove residual OCT compound.\nAdd 1 mL of ARB to the next well in the 24 well plate and transfer sections to this well. Incubate in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h.\nAllow the plate to cool at room temperature (RT) for 20 min.\nAdd 1 mL of PB to the next well and transfer the sections to this well. Incubate at RT for 20 min.\nAdd 500 µL of BB to the next well and transfer the sections to this well. Incubate at RT for 1 h.\nAdd 2 mL of WB to the BB and then pipette out ~2 mL of solution and discard, leaving a diluted BB solution in the well. Repeat until the sections are clearly visible.\nDilute the primary antibody (Chicken IgY anti-GFP, 1:1000) in BB. Add 350-500 µL of primary antibody solution to the next well and transfer the sections to this well. Seal the plate with parafilm and incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nDilute BB with WB as done previously until the sections are clearly visible.",
    "Add 1 mL of WB to the next well and transfer the sections to this well. Incubate at RT for 20 min.\nRemove ~800-900 µL of buffer and discard. Add 1 mL fresh WB and incubate 20 min. Replace 1 mL of WB 4 more times for a total of 5 washes, 20 min each.\nDilute the secondary antibody (Donkey anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated, 1:500) in BB. Add 350-500 µL of the secondary antibody solution to a new well. Incubate at RT for 45 min to 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: This is the seventh well, so if staining sections from more than 2 brains, a new plate will be needed at this point.\nDilute BB with WB as previously and transfer the sections to a new well filled with 1 mL of WB. Wash the sections as done previously for 20 min 3 times.\nPrepare a working solution of DAPI in PBS (final concentration 0.04-0.8 µg/mL). Protect solution from light.\nAdd 1 mL DAPI solution to the next well and transfer the sections to this well. Incubate at RT for ~5 min.\nTransfer the sections back to WB and gently mount on microscope slides using a size 000 paintbrush. Allow the slides to air dry.\nApply coverslips with an appropriate mounting media. Allow slides to cure at RT in the dark overnight.\n5. Image and analyze brain tissue sections for enhancer activity.\nUse a low magnification (5x) objective lens to record fluorescence images that span the brain section.\nLocate the injection site and evaluate the extent of the virus transduction based on the density and intensity of red fluorescent cells. Take care to compare animals that were transduced similarly.\nRecord detailed fluorescent images with a higher magnification objective lens (≥25x) if desired.",
    "NOTE: Always be sure to use the same settings for acquisition parameters such as excitation light intensity, filters, and exposure time between samples that are to be compared.\nProcess the images using image analysis software.\n\tNOTE: Processing may be done in any image analysis software package. The following steps are suggestions for determining whether a sequence acts as an enhancer in the reporter construct context (a yes or no question) using the open-source FIJI distribution of ImageJ. More in-depth photometry may be appropriate when comparing degrees of activity between enhancer variants. Images from different samples should always be processed consistently in order to be compared.\n\t\nApply filters to reduce noise. In Fiji select the Despeckle option under the Process > Noise menu.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a 3 x 3 median filter.\nSubtract background fluorescence following steps 5.4.3-5.4.6.\nSeparate the channels of a multichannel image. In Fiji, select the option Split Channels under the Image > Color menu.\nUse the rectangle or circle selection tool to draw a small shape in an area of the image that does not have any fluorescent cells and measure the average pixel intensity of the background using Analyse > Measure. Repeat to sample multiple areas.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure Mean Gray Value is selected in the Analyze > Set Measurements menu.\nAverage the mean gray value from 5-8 areas of background and drop the decimal point. Subtract this value from each pixel in the image using Process > Math > Subtract.\n\t\tNOTE: Rounding to the nearest whole number could over-estimate the background to subtract. It is more conservative to simply drop the decimal point. For example, 6.4 would be rounded down to 6, but 6.5 should also be rounded down to 6 to avoid the risk of subtracting 0.5 units of real signal from each pixel.",
    "If desired, merge the channels back into a multichannel image. In Fiji, use Image > Color > Merge Channels.\nStitch any overlapping images together. In Fiji, use Plugins > Stitching > Grid/Collection stitching.\nAdjust brightness and contrast. In Fiji, use Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast.\n\t\tNOTE: Always use the same minimum and maximum values for each image to be compared.\nCount the number of green fluorescent cells following steps 5.4.10-5.4.12. These are the cells in which the candidate enhancer sequence was able to drive reporter expression.\nStart by hiding the green channel and use the freeform selection tool to draw a shape around the region of the brain that expresses red fluorescence. Using the Measure function in Fiji, measure the area, integrated density, and mean gray value of the red channel in this zone.\nUsing the multi-point selection tool, count the number of green cells in this zone.\nNormalize the number of green cells by the integrated density of the red channel. The local red channel brightness is a proxy measure for the magnitude of virus exposure, enabling the comparison of enhancer activity between different transduced animals.\nSubscription Required.
