    "1. Sample preparation\nGeneration of multilamellar vesicles (MLVs)\n\t\nCalculate the quantity of chloroform-dissolved lipid(s) according to the desired lipid mixture and required suspension volume.\n\t\tNOTE: A final vesicle concentration of 4 mg/mL lipids is recommended for the resuspension (reaction) buffer.\nPipette the calculated volume of lipids into a 1.5 mL glass vial using positive displacement pipettes equipped with glass tips.\nEvaporate the lipid solvent under a faint stream of nitrogen and constantly rotate the vial to ensure equal distribution of the lipids on the glass walls.\nEnsure full solvent evaporation by placing the vial under a steady stream of nitrogen for 15 min.\nRemove residual traces of chloroform by vacuum drying in a vacuum desiccator for an additional hour.\nRehydrate the lipid mixture in the desired resuspension (reaction) buffer and thoroughly vortex the suspension until the lipid film has been dissolved from the walls of the vial.\n\t\tNOTE: The reaction buffer should ensure protein activity and stability. The reaction buffer used in this study contains 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 7.5), 150 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. Note that any buffer used to dilute lipids or proteins needs to be filtered to remove interfering particulate impurities (see step 5).\nGeneration of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs)\n\t\nFor consecutive freeze-thaw cycles of the lipid resuspension (step 1.1.6), boil 500 mL of water in a beaker on a hot plate (between 70 °C to 99 °C) and prepare a container with liquid nitrogen.\nShock-freeze the lipid resuspension in the liquid nitrogen. Transfer the vial into the beaker with hot water until the solution is completely thawed. Repeat this freeze-thaw cycle 8-10 times or until the previously turbid mixture appears clear.",
    "CAUTION: Use proper safety garments and equipment such as goggles, gloves, and tweezers to prevent any direct contact with the liquid nitrogen, the frozen lipid vial, or the boiling water.\nFor the generation of a monodisperse vesicle distribution, assemble a lipid-extruder and test its integrity with reaction buffer to ensure that it does not leak.\n\t\tNOTE: If leakage is observed, carefully re-assemble the lipid-extruder until no buffer spilling is evident.\nExtrude the lipid suspension for 37 passes through a nucleopore membrane with a pore size of 50 nm26. The number of passes should be uneven to ensure that the final SUV mixture crossed the nucleopore membrane and is hence free of lipid aggregates or multilamellar vesicles. The extruded vesicles will be used later to form supported lipid bilayers (see steps 6 and 7).\n\t\t​NOTE: SUVs can likewise be formed by sonication of the rehydrated lipid mixture. However, preparation via extrusion provides a more monodisperse distribution of SUVs, which facilitates vesicle rupture during supported lipid bilayer formation. Extruded vesicles can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 3 days.\n2. Cleaning of microscope slides\nDistribute an equal number of microscope slides (No. #1.5; 0.17 mm thickness) with dimensions of 24 mm x 60 mm and 24 mm x 24 mm in polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) microscope holders.\nTransfer PTFE holders into beakers containing ultrapure water and sonicate them for 15 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the beaker, the water volume needs to be adjusted to completely cover the PTFE holder.\nUse tweezers to remove the holders from the beaker and replace the water with ultrapure isopropanol. Insert the holder into the beaker containing isopropanol and sonicate again for 15 min.",
    "NOTE: Depending on the beaker, the volume of the isopropanol needs to be adjusted to completely cover the PTFE holder.\nReplace isopropanol with ultrapure water and sonicate the beaker containing the holders for 15 min.\nRemove the PTFE holders from the beakers and blow-dry the microscope slides in the holder under a steady stream of nitrogen gas or compressed air.\n\t​NOTE: Ensure proper cleaning of cover slides by using gloves, clean beakers, and paraffin film to cover each beaker. Otherwise, residual dust might cause significant background fluctuations during MSPT measurements.\n3. Hydrophilization of microscope slides\nNOTE: To obtain a homogeneous and fluid supported lipid bilayer, hydrophilization of slides is essential and must be carried out just before flow chamber assembly.\nPlace PTFE holders containing only 24 mm x 60 mm microscope slides in a plasma cleaner with oxygen as process gas and clean the microscope slides with plasma (parameters used in this work: 30% power, 0.3 mbar oxygen pressure for 30 s; see Table of Materials for details of the plasma cleaner used).\n\t​NOTE: To obtain fluid membranes, plasma cleaning parameters such as power, oxygen pressure, and cleaning time must be adjusted for each instrument. For this purpose, the use of fluorescently labeled lipids is recommended to ensure membrane fluidity, which can be quantified with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments27. If the parameters are not optimized for the respective setup, membrane diffusion might be impaired due to reduced membrane fluidity.\n4. Assembly of flow chambers\nBefore flow chamber assembly, keep the following components ready: cleaned microscope slides (24 mm x 24 mm), hydrophilized microscope slides (24 mm x 60 mm), aluminum foil, flat cardboard, scalpel, and double-sided tape.\nWrap the flat cardboard with aluminum foil.",
    "Spread the cleaned 24 mm x 24 mm microscope slides on the aluminum foil with sufficient distance between each other.\nAttach double-sided tape strips to the upper and lower edges of the slides.\nExcise each microscope slide with the scalpel, such that it can be removed from the aluminum foil. As a result, each slide should have stripes of double-sided tape attached to the upper and lower edges of the slide (see Figure 1).\nAttach the 24 mm x 24 mm slide with the two double-sided tape strips to the hydrophilized 24 mm x 60 mm slide to form a flow path between the smaller and bigger microscope slides.\n\t​NOTE: To ensure clean flow chambers, constantly wear gloves and ensure that the workbench is dust-free.\n5. Filtration of reaction buffers\nSterile filter all reaction buffers through 0.45 µm cellulose acetate membranes to ensure minimal background signal during MSPT measurements.\n\t​NOTE: If the presence of nucleotides, such as ATP, is essential for a successful experiment, be aware of a potential increase in the background signal. It is recommended to only use minimal amounts that still ensure protein activity.\n6. Supported lipid bilayer (SLB) formation\nNOTE: It is recommended to perform the formation of supported lipid bilayers on the mass photometer to visually ensure successful vesicle spreading and the complete removal of unfused vesicles.\nDilute freshly extruded SUVs (see step 1 for more details) to a final concentration of 0.4 mg/mL in the required reaction buffer. Optionally, to promote vesicle rupture, add 2 mM CaCl2 to the vesicle suspension.",
    "NOTE: Divalent cations might cause the aggregation of some lipids such as PiP2. For mixtures containing such lipids, refrain from using CaCl2 for the promotion of vesicle rupture or other divalent cations in the resuspension buffer. If required for the experiment, divalent cations can be added after the successful formation of the supported lipid bilayer.\nFlush 50 µL of the vesicle suspension into the flow chamber (step 4) and incubate the chamber for 2 min.\n\tNOTE: Buffers, vesicles, or protein solutions can be flushed through the flow chamber with a small piece of soaking tissue. However, it is also possible to use a mechanical pump system.\nRemove unfused vesicles through repeated (at least three times) washing of the flow chamber with 200 µL of the reaction buffer each time.\n\t​NOTE: Vesicles need to be thoroughly washed out of the flow chamber to ensure a stable background signal during MSPT measurements.\n7. Generation of calibration curve\nNOTE: To convert the contrast of detected particles into molecular mass, their signal needs to be calibrated using proteins of known sizes. It is recommended to adjust the standard protein size regime to cover the range of molecular masses expected for the system of interest.\nBiotinylation of standard proteins with a cysteine residue\n\t\nCalculate the appropriate amount of maleimide-biotin for the standard protein according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nIncubate the standard protein with the determined volume of maleimide-biotin for 1 h at room temperature.\nTo remove unconjugated maleimide-biotin from the conjugated biotin-protein complex, perform size-exclusion chromatography on a column suitable for the protein of interest.\nDetermine the protein concentration using a Bradford Assay.\n\t\tNOTE: To store the standard protein for further measurements, freeze the protein in single-use aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C.\nMeasurement of standard proteins for the calibration curve",
    "In a flow chamber, prepare a supported lipid bilayer with 0.4 mg/mL extruded SUVs (see steps 1 and 6 for more details) containing 0.01 mol% (v/v) Biotinyl Cap PE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-cap biotinyl).\nAdd 50 µL of 2.5 nM divalent streptavidin to the bilayer in the flow chamber and incubate for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Divalent streptavidin has been expressed and purified as outlined in Howarth et al.28. Tetravalent streptavidin can likewise be used. However, the use of divalent streptavidin can reduce the possible reaction stoichiometries between biotinylated lipids and standard proteins that are conjugated to a biotin moiety in order to facilitate the assignment of species.\nRemove unbound divalent streptavidin with 100 µL of reaction buffer.\nAdd 50 µL of 100 nM biotin-conjugated standard protein to the bilayer in the flow chamber and incubate for 2 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the biotinylation efficiency and whether di- or tetravalent streptavidin is used, the optimum concentrations of biotin-conjugated standard protein and streptavidin may vary.\nPerform MSPT measurement according to the details outlined in step 8.\n\t\tCAUTION: Imaging conditions need to be identical for both sample and calibration standards.\n8. Imaging\nSLB formation and sample preparation\n\t\nAs described in more detail in step 6, introduce SUVs of the desired lipid mixture (25 µL) to the sample flow chamber and form a supported lipid bilayer. Thoroughly wash the chamber (three times) with 100 µL of reaction buffer to remove all unfused vesicles.\nAdd 50 µL of the protein of interest to the sample chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: As MSPT is a single-particle method, protein concentration must be kept in the pM to nM range to allow for undisturbed particle detection and tracking.\nVideo acquisition",
    "Set the desired imaging conditions such as the size of the field of view (FOV), frame rate, exposure time, and acquisition time in the acquisition software.\n\t\tNOTE: The following settings have proven to work for MSPT on a commercial mass photometer (see Table of Materials): FOV of 128 pixels x 35 pixels, a frame rate of 1 kHz resulting in roughly 200 frames per second after subsequent 5-fold frame averaging, and an exposure time of 0.95 ms.\nAdjust the focus automatically or manually. If necessary, move the FOV to a position with a homogenous membrane using the lateral control.\nCreate a project folder and start recording the movie. Upon completion of the recording, specify a file name in the dialog prompted by the acquisition software. The movie is then automatically saved to the project folder as an MP file for subsequent analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Record at least three replicates in different flow chambers to ensure the integrity of individual membranes and reproducibility of results. The movie duration can be set in advance and depends on the type of experiment. In most cases, an acquisition time between 5 min and 7 min is recommended.\n\t\t​CAUTION: By default, movie recordings on the commercial mass photometer acquisition software are compressed before being saved to reduce storage space. However, file compression needs to be turned off to enable custom data analysis as described in this protocol. Details on how to turn off file compression can be found in the manufacturer's user manual.\n9. Data analysis",
    "NOTE: The data analysis pipeline is accompanied by two interactive Jupyter notebooks (MSPT analysis.ipynb, Movie visualization.ipynb). The Jupyter notebooks and associated custom-written Python modules necessary to perform the MSPT analysis outlined below are available in a public repository: https://github.com/MSPT-toolkit/MSPT-toolkit. For detailed instructions on the analysis below, readers are referred to MSPT analysis.ipynb accessed using the above link.\nVideo processing\n\t\nRemove dominant static scattering of light with the pixel-wise background estimation algorithm using the image_processing.mp_reader function.\n\t\t\nTo apply the background removal, choose the option continuous_median for the parameter mode and set an appropriate length for the sliding median window (window_length) in notebook section B.1. Optionally, save the movies after background removal to be used for particle detection and trajectory linking (by setting the parameter save_processed_movies to True).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Adjust the window size (window_length) to values between 101 and 2001 depending on the particle density on the membrane, the expected diffusion coefficient, acquisition frame rate, and the required processing speed.\n\t\t\tCAUTION: The background removal strategy works well if the membrane is not too densely packed and if the diffusion of the particles is sufficiently fast (i.e., each pixel is most of the time not occupied with a particle). Otherwise, the contrast of the particles will be systematically underestimated as they cannot be properly distinguished from the background signal. This can be compensated for by increasing the median window size at the cost of computational speed. However, be aware that setting the window size too large may negatively influence the output due to sample drift. A visual inspection of the processed videos is crucial.\nDetect particles and their respective position throughout the movie using the function particle_fitting.particle_fitter (see notebook section B.2).",
    "Tune the sensitivity of particle detection with the threshold parameter (thresh; see notebook section B.1), which is used to highlight candidate spots by image binarization. The effect of varying threshold parameters on spot detection sensitivity can be examined in a separate notebook (Movie visualization.ipynb). The results of particle detection are automatically saved to CSV files in a subdirectory of the movie file.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Setting the threshold parameter arbitrarily low (for example, for movies taken with the used mass photometer, a threshold parameter below 0.0005) is not recommended as candidate spots will be dominated by spurious noise and hence prolong processing time.\nLink particles in consecutive frames into trajectories using the Python package trackpy (v.0.5.0)29.\n\tNOTE: The trajectory linking is performed on the fly after spot detection. As a result, an additional CSV file containing the trajectory information is stored in a subdirectory of the particle detection CSV file.\n\t\nRemove trajectories with too few points using the parameter minimum_trajectory_length (see notebook section B.1) to enable a robust determination of diffusion coefficients. For detailed explanations regarding the other parameters of trackpy functions, refer to trackpy's documentation.\nTrajectory analysis\n\t\nIn notebook section C.1, specify the frame rate (frame_rate) and pixel size in nm (pixel_size), which were used for movie acquisition. Create a list of CSV files containing the trajectory information returned by trackpy (see step 9.2) with the trajectory_analysis.get_csv_files function (notebook section C.2).\nAdditionally, specify an output filename for the HDF5 container, which is used to store the fitting results on disk (notebook section C.3). Analyze all trajectories with the trajectory_analysis.fit_trajectories function in notebook section C.4, which iterates through the list of CSV files. This function uses jump distance distribution (JDD)30 and mean squared displacement (MSD)31 analysis to estimate the diffusion coefficient of each trajectory.",
    "Convert the median contrast of each trajectory to its corresponding mass by using the contrast-mass relationship obtained from the MSPT calibration (see section 7). Specify the slope (slope) and y-intercept (offset) of the calibration line, which relates iSCAT contrast to molecular mass (function trajectory_analysis.apply_calibration; see notebook section C.5). This function adds a column with the trajectory's median mass to each data frame.\nEvaluate the apparent particle density on the membrane with the function trajectory_analysis.membrane_density, which returns the median density value in terms of detected particles and present trajectories during each frame (see notebook section C.6) as additional columns in the data frame.\n\t\t​NOTE: As a portion of particles will be lost during both the detection and trajectory linking process, the actual particle densities may be higher. For reliable results regarding particle densities as well as mass histograms, visually inspect representative movie snapshots to verify that the measurement conditions are plausible for single-particle tracking (see step 9.1.1).\n10. Data visualization\nIllustrate the correlation of mass and diffusion coefficient with two-dimensional kernel density estimation (KDE), which is based on the Python package fastkde (v.1.0.19; https://pypi.org/project/fastkde/).\nTo generate the plot, specify the HDF5 file containing the MSPT results (see step 9.3.2 and notebook section D.1) and select a single (notebook section D.2) or a concatenated data frame (notebook section D.3) as input data for the plotting.generate_2D_KDE function (notebook section D.4).\n\tNOTE: Each plotted dataset should contain ideally more than 1,000 trajectories for a reliable 2D-KDE."
