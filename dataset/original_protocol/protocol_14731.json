    "This patient related study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) for human research.\n1. Patient Preparation and Positioning\nBring the patient to the procedure suite and place them on their right or left side with knees flexed to the chest.\nPerform a surgical timeout whereby the patient, surgical procedure, and indication are reviewed and confirmed.\nWhen indicated, administer intravenous sedation via the anesthesia service.\n2. Perform a Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)\nPlace size appropriate gloves onto both hands.\nInsert gloved finger after lubrication into rectal vault and examine prostate to feel for potential suspicious areas in need of focused attention during transrectal ultrasonography.10\n3. Creation of Povidone Iodine Rectal Preparation (PIRP)\nPour 15 ml of a 10% commercially available povidone iodine solution into a sterile basin.\nAdd 5 ml of a commercially available 1% lidocaine gel to this basin.\nMix the contents for 15 sec to create a povidone iodine slurry.\n4. Primary Administration of PIRP\nUse a sterile rectal swab to culture the rectal vault.\nOpen up a 4 cm x 4 cm sterile gauze, soak in the povidone iodine slurry, and then insert into the rectal vault. Only a small tail of gauze is left emanating from the anus.\nLeave the gauze in place for 2 min after which it is removed and discarded.\n5. Secondary Administration of PIRP\nUse a disposable gynecologic swab to paint the perianal area with the PIRP solution.\nInsert this gynecologic swab into the rectal vault to a distance of 3 cm from the anus.\nTo further maximize the exposure of the rectal mucosa to PIRP, swab the rectal vault in a similar manner at least three times.",
    "Allow the povidone iodine solution to dry for 2 - 3 min prior to proceeding with standard transrectal ultrasonography and subsequent biopsy.11 This is essential as the bactericidal effects of the PIRP require the solution to dry on the exposed mucosa.\nUse a sterile rectal swab to culture the rectal vault.\n6. Transrectal Ultrasonography and Biopsy\nInsert the ultrasound probe via the rectum.\nPerform measurements of the prostate and subsequent biopsy in the standard manner consistent with all urologic practices.11,12\nSubscription Required.
