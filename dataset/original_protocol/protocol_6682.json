    "Isolation of total RNA from R. palustris Notes: It is crucial to choose the proper cell lysis method for the organism of interest in order to capture the native charging state of tRNA. The method described here, based on micro beads and a beadbeater, is routinely used in our group to isolate RNA from R. palustris and related α-proteobacteria. We strongly advise the reader to test different lysis methods for their organism of interest (e.g., the ratio between bead volume and medium volume, the number of cell beating cycles, etc.).  Another note about tRNA charging states is that, as elaborated elsewhere (Janssen et al., 2012; Bullwinkle and Ibba, 2016), the sample needs to be kept in acidic conditions all the time. Acidic buffers and gel systems are used throughout this protocol.  RNA purified from Procedure A can be used directly in the following steps in this protocol. This is because the charging state of tRNA is calculated based on the ratio of charged vs uncharged tRNA. Slight contamination of DNA and/or protein, therefore, will not affect the end result after the purification described here. If the purified RNA is to be used in other procedure such as RNAseq or in vitro translation, further purification would be required. Before the experiment, prepare one screw-capped 2 ml centrifuge tube for each sample. Add ~500 µl of Zirconia/Silica Beads into each tube and autoclave all of the tubes.Grow R. palustris cultures as required by the experimental question. Typical growth conditions that we use are given in Kim and Harwood (1991). However, the composition of the cultivation medium is not important for the protocol we describe here. The typical sample contains 3-5 ml of culture at Abs660 ~1.2.",
    "Collect the cells at 4 °C by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm and store the pellets at -80 °C.Resuspend each frozen cell pellet in 1 ml of QIAzol Lysis Reagent. Mix gently with pipetting and transfer the resuspended samples into the tubes with beads. This step should be performed on ice.Break the cells with a beadbeater at 3,500 rpm for 1 min and then place the samples on ice for another 1 min. Repeat this cycle 3 more times.Place all the samples at room temperature for 5 min.Add 200 µl chloroform to each sample. Shake the tube vigorously by hand for 15 s.Place the tube at room temperature for 3 min.Centrifuge the samples for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C. Carefully transfer 560 µl of the colorless upper aqueous phase to a new 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.Add 0.5 ml isopropanol and mix thoroughly by vortexing.Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.Add 1 ml of 75% ethanol. Centrifuge for 5 min at 7,500 x g at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant completely. Air-dry the RNA pellet in a fume hood briefly (5-10 min).Re-dissolve each RNA pellet in 10 mM of sodium acetate, pH 4.5. The purified RNA can be stored at -80 °C for at least two weeks. A typical yield is 50 µl of 5 µg/µl total RNA. This number can vary depending on factors such as species, growth states and sampling volume.Alkaline pH treatment to produce a deacylated (uncharged) tRNA controlTake ~10 µg of purified RNA. Add stock solution of 0.5 M EDTA and 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) directly to the sample in order to adjust the final buffer to 1 mM EDTA and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Adjust final volume to 50 µl. Mix well by pipetting.",
    "Incubate the sample at 42 °C for 60 min.Add 5 µl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 to the sample. Reverting the buffer back to pH 5.2 will not make the sample acylated again.Add 137.5 µl of ice-cold 95% ethanol to the sample, then incubate on ice for 10 min.Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to precipitate RNA.Remove the supernatant and wash the RNA pellet with 1 ml of 70% ethanol.Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant completely. Air-dry the RNA pellet as needed.Dissolve deacylated RNA with ~30 µl 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5.Making DIG-labeled probe for tRNA-TrpDIG RNA labeling kit was used in our project to generate labeled probe for subsequent experiments. Equivalent reagents, such as DNase I and T7 RNA polymerase, can be substituted where suitable. Other strategies such as the classical P32-labeling can also be used for this step. If so, the following experiments should be adjusted accordingly. As the detailed protocol for the DIG kit is commercially available, this section will focus on how we adapted it to detect tRNATrp in R. palustris CGA009.A stretch of 31 nucleotides in R. palustris CGA009 tRNATrp was chosen as the target of the probe. The following dsDNA was commercially made (IDT) as the template of in vitro transcription:TGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGTTTTGGAGACCGGTGCTCTACCAATTGAG A basic purification level, which should be molecular biology grade by default, was sufficient for dsDNA in our experience. We have also ordered two complementing ssDNA and annealed them together to form the dsDNA (see Reference 5 for more information), and it worked as well.    Within the above sequence, the shaded part is the promoter for T7 RNA polymerase and the underscored part is the reverse-complement of our target on tRNATrp.",
    "A 7-bp clamp is added before the promoter to facilitate polymerase binding. The selection of tRNA target-sequence needs to be done case by case and the readers are encouraged to try several candidate sequences.Make the reaction mixture following the instructions for the DIG RNA labeling kit. Below is an example we used for our project (all reagents here except the template are included in the kit). The volume can be scaled up or down as needed.9 µl RNase-free water4 µl transcription (5x) buffer4 µl DIG labeling mix2 µl T7 polymerase1 µl template of dsDNA (10 ng/µl is sufficient)Incubate the reaction mixture at 42 °C for 1.5 h.For each reaction, add 2 µl DNaseI and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.There is no need to further purify the probe. The reaction product is diluted and ready for further steps. A testing Northern blot, such as a dot blot with total RNA, can be used to determine the optimal dilution factor for the probe to be used in actual experiments (e.g., make a serial dilution of the probe by the factor of 10, then test which concentration generates the best signal-noise ratio in reader’s detection system).Acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAn electrophoresis system of at least 20 cm in height is recommended to analyze the charging states of tRNAs. The thickness of gel/spacer does not matter as long as the well can be sufficiently cleaned of urea. The difference between charged and uncharged tRNA is small in size. A smaller gel might be suitable to analyze some peptidyl-tRNAs, but in general does not provide the resolution to analyze aminoacyl-tRNAs. For each run, a sample of uncharged tRNA must be included as the negative control.Assemble the electrophoresis system with acid-urea gel.",
    "Add the cold sodium acetate-EDTA running buffer and pre-run the gel at 20 V for 30 min at 4 °C. The purpose of pre-running is to bring up the temperature of the gel. See more information at company’s page (see Reference 6).Incubate the sample at 72 °C for 3 min. Briefly spin the sample and mix it with the loading buffer at a 1:1 ratio. We usually loaded ~20 µl of sample, a total of 2.5-5 µg total tRNA, per well for a gel of 20 cm height. The minimum and maximum amounts of sample required need to be tested and determined case by case.Clean the loading wells with syringe and needle. This needs to be done immediately before applying the sample to the well. For acid-urea gel, urea continues to accumulate in the well. This can prevent the sample from settling at the bottom of the well if not properly cleaned.Load the sample. There should be no change of dye color. Run the gel at 15 W for 12 h (for a gel of 20 cm height) at 4 °C. It is crucial to bring up and maintain the operating temperature of the gel during the run, hence the setting of constant power as well as the pre-run specified above (see Reference 5 for more information).Northern blot analysisAfter the electrophoresis, any standard protocol suiting the available system can be used to transfer RNA from the gel to a membrane. In our case, we used 0.5x TBE as the transfer buffer. We did a standard wet-transfer was at 4 °C, either at 20 V overnight or at 650 mA for 30 min. No obvious difference was observed between the two settings. The membrane is then ready for cross-link and following Northern blot.",
    "In our experience, exposure to a UV-light box for 10-15 min was sufficient and could serve as a start point.The standard protocol of the DIG system (Roche, see Reference 7 for more information) was used for Northern blot blocking, washing and detection steps. Briefly, the probe for tRNATrp is used to detect tRNATrp on the membrane, followed by interaction with Anti-Digoxigenin-AP and then CDP-Star to generate chemiluminescence signals. Any suitable imaging system, such as film or digital imager, can be used to detect and quantify the results."
