    "NOTE: The melanocyte protocol outlined here was first demonstrated by Mica et al.\n1. Preparation of Culture Medium, Coated Dishes and Maintenance of hPSCs\nMedium Preparation\n\tNote: Store all medium at 4 °C in the dark for up to 2 weeks. Filter all medium for sterilization.\n\t\nPrepare DMEM/10% FBS. Mix 885 ml DMEM, 100 ml FBS, 10 ml Pen/Strep and 5 ml L-Glutamine. Filter for sterilization.\nPrepare hESC-medium. Mix 800 ml DMEM/F12, 200 ml KSR, 5 ml L-Glutamine, 10 ml MEM minimum essential amino acids solution, 1 ml β-Mercaptoethanol, and 5 ml Pen/Strep. After filtering add 10 ng/ml FGF-2.\nPrepare KSR-differentiation medium: Mix 820 ml Knockout DMEM, 150 ml KSR, 10 ml L-Glutamine, 10 ml Pen/Strep, 10 ml MEM minimum essential amino acids solution and 1 ml β-Mercaptoethanol. Filter for sterilization.\nPrepare N2-differentiation medium. Dissolve 12 g DMEM/F12 powder in 980 ml dH2O. Add 1.55 g glucose, 2 g sodium bicarbonate and 100 mg apo human transferrin. Mix 2 ml dH2O with 25 mg human insulin and 40 µl 1 N NaOH; once dissolved, add the mixture to the medium. Add 100 µl putrescine dihydrochloride, 60 µl selenite, 100 µl progesterone. Bring the final volume to 1 l with dH2O before filtering.\nPrepare Full melanocyte medium. Combine 50% Neurobasal medium, 30% Low glucose DMEM, and 20% MCDB201. To this add: 0.8% ITS+, 250 nM L-glutamine, 100 µM Ascorbic Acid (L-AA), 50 ng/ml Cholera toxin, 50 ng/ml SCF, 0.05 µM Dexamethasone, 100 nM EDN3, 4 ng/ml FGF2. Sterile filter then add remaining reagents: 2% B27 Supplement, 25 ng/ml BMP4, 3 µM CHIR99021, 500 µM cAMP.\nCoating of Culture Dishes",
    "Carry out coating using gelatinous protein such as Matrigel. Upon opening, aliquot and freeze Matrigel into 1 ml parts to avoid repetitive freeze thaw cycles. Thaw and re-suspend a 1 ml frozen aliquot with 19 ml DMEM/F12. Plate 5 ml onto a 10 cm dish. Incubate the dishes for 1 hr at RT. Aspirate the gelatinous protein immediately before plating the cells and wash with DMEM/F12.\nCarry out coating using Poly-L ornithin hydrobromide/ mouse Laminin-I/ fibronectin (PO/Lam/FN). Coat dish with PBS containing 15 µg/ml Poly-L ornithin hydrobromide. Incubate O/N at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Aspirate the solution and wash the plates with PBS three times before coating with PBS containing 1 µg/ml mouse Laminin-I and 2 µg/ml fibronectin. Incubate the dishes O/N at 37 °C in a humidified incubator.\n\t\t\nPrior to plating cells, aspirate the solution and let the plates dry thoroughly without the lid in the tissue culture hood. Allow the plates to dry for approximately 10-15 min.\n\t\t\tNote: The dishes are dry and ready for cell plating when crystal structures appear on the surface by eye. The plates can be kept with PBS containing LAM/FN in the incubator for two weeks, as long as the liquid does not evaporate. The plates can be kept dried at RT for a few hr. \nMaintenance of hPSCs\n\tNote: hPSCs are maintained on 0.1% gelatin and mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in hESC-medium. The cells should be split every 6-8 days.\n\t\nCoat a 10 cm dish with 0.1% gelatin in PBS at RT for 5 min.\nThaw frozen MEFs quickly in a 37 °C water bath.\nAspirate the gelatin and plate the cells. Plate MEFs at a density of ~50,000 cells/cm2 in DMEM/10% FBS. Incubate MEFs at 37 °C O/N prior to adding hPSCs.",
    "Aspirate the DMEM/10% FBS from the prepared MEF plate, wash plate with PBS and add 10 ml hESC-medium with hPSCs. Passage the hPSCs at a ratio of 1:5/10 depending on density prior to passaging.\n\t\tNote: If the hPSCs are being thawed or passaged as single cells, supplement with 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (ROCKi) until the first passage.\nFeed cells daily with fresh 10 ml hESC-medium.\nPrior to starting a differentiation remove any pluripotent colonies that appear to contain differentiated cells, irregular borders, or transparent centers 28. Mechanically dislodge and aspirate the irregular colonies with a pipette under a laminar flow hood with a dissecting microscope.\n2. Plating of hPSCs for Differentiation\nNote: Differentiation conditions are described for 10 cm dishes.\nPrepare 10 cm Matrigel dishes before starting the differentiation as described in Step 1.3.1.\nWhen plating hPSCs for a differentiation start with a plate of hPSCs at a density ready for passage (~80% confluent) aspirate the hESC-medium, wash with PBS and add 3 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to the cells.\nVigorously shake the dish horizontally for 2 min while visualizing under the microscope until the MEFs lift off as single cells. The hPSC colonies should remain attached as colonies.\nAspirate the trypsin after the MEFs have lifted but before the hPSCs colonies detach.\nAdd 10 ml of hESC-medium containing 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride to the plate and detach the cells by pipetting up and down over the colonies.\nAspirate the Matrigel solution from the 10 cm dish prepared in step 2.1 and wash with DMEM/F12 to remove clumps. Plate the hPSCs at a 1:2 ratio onto the Matrigel plate. Add hESC-medium containing 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride up to 10ml. Incubate at 37 °C O/N.\n\tNote: This plating should result in approximately 100,000 cells/cm2.\n3. Induction of Neural Differentiation",
    "Note: The differentiation should be initiated (day 0) when the hPSCs are 80% confluent. The cells can be fed daily with hESC-medium containing 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride until beginning the differentiation.\nOn day 0 and day 1, feed the cells with 10 ml of KSR-differentiation medium containing 100 nM LDN193189 and 10 µM SB431542.\nOn day 2, feed the cells with 10 ml of KSR-differentiation medium containing 100 nM LDN193189, 10 µM SB431542 and 3 µM CHIR99021.\nOn day 3, feed the cells with 10 ml of KSR-differentiation medium containing 10 µM SB431542 and 3 µM CHIR99021.\nOn days 4 and 5 feed the cells with 15 ml of 75% KSR-differentiation medium and 25% N2-differentiation medium containing 3 µM CHIR99021.\n\tNote: Do not be alarmed to see a large amount of cell death in terms of floating cells. This is normal and to be expected.\nOn days 6 and 7 feed the cells with 15 ml of 50% KSR-differentiation medium and 50% N2-differentiation medium both containing 3 µM CHIR99021, 25 ng/ml BMP4, and 100 nM EDN3.\nOn days 8 and 9 feed the cells with 20 ml of 25% KSR-differentiation medium and 75% N2-differentiation medium both containing 3 µM CHIR99021, 25 ng/ml BMP4, and 100 nM EDN3.\nOn days 9 and 10 prepare PO/Lam/FN dishes as indicated in 1.2.2 for re-plating of the cells on day 11.\nOn day 10 feed cells with 20 ml of N2-differentiation medium containing 3 µM CHIR99021, 25 ng/ml BMP4, and 100 nM EDN3.\n4. Replating in Droplets for NC Specification\nOn day 11 aspirate Lam/FN from the prepared PO/LAM/FN plates and dry completely.\nRemove medium from the Day 11 cells, wash with PBS and add 4 ml cell detachment solution such as Accutase per 10 cm dish. Incubate for 25 min at 37 °C.",
    "Add 5 ml of Full Melanocyte medium to the dish and resuspend the cells by manually pipetting up and down with a 10 ml pipette until all the cells have lifted off the plate. Transfer the suspension to a 15 ml tube.\nSpin the cells down for 5 min at 200 x g and resuspend the cells at 2 x 106 cells per ml in Full Melanocyte medium. Count the cells using the trypan blue exclusion on a hemocytometer or equivalent technique.\nPlate 10 µl droplets close to each other (without them touching) onto the dried PO/Lam/FN 10 cm dishes. If the plate has been sufficiently dried, the droplets should have well defined edges and not run.\n\tNote: This creates a high density local environment for the cells, which is important when replating the cells, while maintaining room within the dish for expansion.\nAllow the droplets to stand at RT for 10-20 min to allow cells to adhere, then slowly (not to disturb the attached cells) add 10 ml of Full Melanocyte medium. Move dish to the incubator.\n5. Expanding Melanocyte Progenitors\nContinue feeding with Full Melanocyte medium every 2 to 3 days.\n\tNote: Pigmentation should start to be visible within clusters of cells by the end of the first week and become very clear by the second week. View the plate over a white background such as a sheet of paper to discern these early small, dark clusters. Cells will become progressively more pigmented over time, until the entire plate is uniformly pigmented (See Figure 2B).\nPassage cells once a week at a ratio of ~1:6 (plating as droplets is no longer necessary at this stage). Use Accutase to dissociate cells and wash twice with plain Neurobasal medium before re-plating in Full Melanocyte medium. Maintain cells on PO/LAM/FN plates.",
    "Note: We have found that the Full Melanocyte medium is best suited for maintaining and expanding hESC and iPSC-derived melanocytes. However, cells can be briefly cultured in commercially available M254 medium but the simplified media increases the risk of cells dying and lifting off the plate.\nSubscription Required.
