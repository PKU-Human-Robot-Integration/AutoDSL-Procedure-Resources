    "The line of P. americana was initially provided by Dr. Huiling Hao. This species has been maintained with inbreeding for 30 years9.\n1. Hatching and feeding of P. americana\nCollect fresh oothecae (immediately post egg-laying) of P. americana and incubate in the dark incubator at 25 °C and 60% humidity for ~25 days. Then increase the temperature and humidity to 30 °C and 75% 3 days before hatching.\nUse a sieve with 4 mm aperture to separate the hatched nymphs from oothecae.\nKeep the nymphs in cylindrical containers (12 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height) in the dark at 28 °C, 70% humidity. Brush the inside edge of the containers with vaseline to prevent cockroaches from escaping. Provide rat food, water, and shelter (egg trays). Pay attention to the activity of the nymphs and regularly clean up the feces and debris.\n2. Selection of the nymphs in proper instar\nUse a glass tube to pick out the freshly molted P. americana (white in body color). Keep them in new containers and wait for the correct stage for treatment.\n\t​NOTE: After ~19 days under the above feeding conditions, the nymphs in the 3rd instars will be available for injection. The color of freshly molted cockroaches is white, and the instars are clarified by molting times.\n3. Preparation of the target fragment with T7 promoters\nUsing the cDNA of P. americana as a template, design paired primers to perform PCR to obtain 300-800 bp DNA fragment of the target gene9. Then clone the PCR fragment into a pTOPO vector (see Table of Materials) for sequencing.",
    "Using the target fragment DNA as a template, synthesize one new pair of primers with T7 promoter sequence (5'-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3') at the 5' terminals and perform another round of PCR to obtain the target fragment with T7 promoters on each side9.\n4. Transcription and synthesis of dsRNA in vitro\nAdd 10 µL of T7 2X Buffer, 2 µL of the Enzyme Mix, T7 Express (see Table of Materials), and 2 µg of PCR product (obtained in step 3.2) in the reaction system and add up the total volume to 20 µL with ddH2O. Gently mix upside down manually and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min and 70 °C for 10 min, and then slowly cool to room temperature.\nDilute RNase A solution (4 µg/µL) with ddH2O at a ratio of 1:200. Then add 1 µL of RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (1 U/µL) and 1 µL of diluted RNase A solution to the system (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Now, the volume of a single system is 22 µL.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Then add 10% of the total volume (when performing N reactions simultaneously, the total volume is N x 22 µL) of Sodium acetate and three volumes of the total volume of isopropanol.\nGently mix upside down manually, place on ice for 5 min, and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the supernatant with a pipette, wash the residue with 75% ethanol (with 25% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water), and then centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove supernatant again. Air-dry the pellet for 15 min at room temperature. Use ~100 µL of DEPC water to dissolve dsRNA, then dilute the dsRNA to the final 2 µg/µL.",
    "​NOTE: The dsRNA could be stored at -80 °C for 6 months.\n5. Loading dsRNA solution into the syringe\nSet up the program in the micro-injection pump (see Table of Materials) in advance to ensure that the volume of each injection is consistent. Before using the syringe, clean the syringe by filling it with DEPC water 8-10 times.\nInstall the 10 µL Syringe on the micro-injection pump, start the pump, and fill the syringe with 10 µL of dsRNA solution (prepared at step 4.6). Inject 1 µL of the dsRNA into a 3rd instar nymph (see step 2) and ensure that it does not leak out to the body.\n6. Injecting dsRNA to P. americana\nAnesthetize the cockroaches with an increased concentration of CO2 in a container until the cockroaches do not move anymore, and then proceed immediately with the injection.\nGently pick up the cockroach with tweezers, and deliver the cockroach toward the needle with hand. Next, insert the needle via the gap between two abdominal somites horizontally against the epidermis. About insert depth, the shallower, the better.\nThen, inject the dsRNA solution into the cockroach. Finally, pull out the needle tip. Ensure that the needle tip is as close as possible to the epidermis to avoid damaging internal organs.\n\tNOTE: The injection should be made under a dissection microscope.\nPut the injected cockroaches into clean bioassay containers. Wait for about 10-20 min to let them recover from the CO2 effects. Label the containers with the date of injection, type and dose of dsRNA, and age of the P. americana.\nPlace the injected cockroaches in a dark environment at 28 °C, 70% humidity, provide water, feed, and shelter, and observe possible changes in the phenotype of the cockroaches regularly.\n7. Knockdown confirmation and phenotypic analysis",
    "Evaluate the efficiency of RNAi using any available molecular biology techniques such as quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. For detailed qRT-PCR and Western blotting procedures, see References1,12.\nTo observe and analyze RNAi-related phenotypes, use the microscope suitable for living animals.\n\tNOTE: RNAi may affect the morphology, behavior, molting, limb regeneration, and other physiological activities of cockroaches. The specific frequency of phenotype is calculated according to specific conditions.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
