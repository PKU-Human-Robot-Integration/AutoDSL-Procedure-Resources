    "1. Preparations\nCulture endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs)\n\tNOTE: Fetal ECFC samples used in these experiments were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and cultured by the Angio BioCore (ABC) at the Indiana University School of Medicine as previously described6. Routine quality control phenotyping was conducted within the ABC to confirm expression of endothelial antigens as previously described19,20,21. Samples used in experiments were passaged minimally (2-3 times). All tissue culture work was performed in a tissue culture hood. All reagents, including tissue culture plates and solutions, were sterile.\n\t\nTwo days prior to the experiment, coat 100 mm round tissue culture plates with 6 mL of 0.05 mg/mL type 1 collagen, and incubate at 37 °C overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: Type 1 collagen is diluted in double-distilled water containing 20 nM acetic acid to a working concentration of 0.05 mg/mL.\nThe day prior to the experiment, trypsinize and replate ECFCs on the type 1 collagen coated plates in 1.1.1. (See Note under 1.1).\nTo trypsinize ECFCs, aspirate media from plated cells and wash with 7 mL of PBS. Aspirate PBS, then add 2-3 mL of 0.5% trypsin and incubate cells for 2-5 min at 37 °C.\nImmediately following incubation with trypsin, add 3 mL of EGM2 and pipet up and down to dislodge all adherent cells. Transfer cell suspension to a 15-mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge all samples at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate supernatant and re-suspend cell pellets in 1-2 mL of EGM2. Mix the cell suspension thoroughly and remove a small aliquot (20-40 μL) for counting.\nAdd equal parts trypan blue to the cell aliquot and pipette 10 µL onto a hemocytometer. Count the number of cells in the four primary quadrants of the hemocytometer.",
    "NOTE: Use both sides of the hemocytometer for all sample counts to increase accuracy.\nWash the collagen-coated tissue culture plates, which were prepared in step 1.1.1, twice with 7 mL of PBS. After aspirating the second PBS wash, add 10 mL of endothelial growth medium 2 (EGM2) culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum to the plates.\nUsing the cell counts obtained in step 1.1.7, calculate the volume of cell suspension required to plate 4 x 105 cells. Plate 4 x 105 ECFCs on the tissue culture plates prepared in step 1.1.8, and incubate at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) overnight.\nPrior to the experiment, store supplies at 4 °C overnight\nStore a 3\" x 2\" metal plate, slide (keep in package until open in hood), a box of sterile 20 microliter (μL) tips, and basement membrane matrix (matrix).\n\t\tNOTE: The matrix is kept at -80 °C for long-term storage; always thaw it at 4 °C overnight or for several hours prior to use.\nConfirm availability of adequate space for the images on the computer's hard-drives.\n\tNOTE: Using the configuration outlined in this protocol, approximately 60 gigabytes (GB) of space were required per experiment (4 GB/well). However, space estimates are based on hardware configuration and will need to be determined for each system.\n2. Protocol 1: Experimental Setup: Preparing the Slide\nGather and prepare supplies\nThe day of the experiment, gather supplies for plating cells on the slide, including a bucket of ice, a small container of dry ice, a pair of scissors, and a 20 μL pipette. Spray all items with 70% ethanol, wipe dry with paper towels, and place items into a sterile tissue culture hood.",
    "Gather all supplies stored at 4 °C (see step 1.2) including the metal plate, box of tips, slide, and matrix. Spray the box of tips with 70% ethanol and place the box in the container of dry ice.\n\t\tNOTE:Remove matrix from the 4 °C fridge only when ready to use and always keep the matrix on ice.\nSpray the metal plate with 70% ethanol and embed it into the ice in the ice bucket. Open the package containing the slide, and place the slide on the metal plate to keep it cold.\nLoad matrix onto the slide\nSet the pipette to 10 μL and remove the tip from cold tip box with the pipette. Cut approximately 1 cm off the end of the tip with the scissors.\n\t\tNOTE:Cut perpendicular to the tip to reduce bubbles in the matrix. The pipette can be set to a volume slightly greater than 10 μL to account for matrix sticking to the inside of the tip.\nSlowly draw the matrix into the pipette tip. Immediately place the pipette tip on the center of the well. Gently touch the pipette tip to the bottom of the well and slowly push the matrix out.\n\t\tNOTE:Do not over pipette, as this will cause bubbles to form. If a bubble forms, pop it immediately using a small tip.\nThe slide contains 15 individual wells. Repeat the previous step for each well. Use a new pipette tip for each well to maintain consistency and reduce matrix solidifying inside the tip.\nOnce the slide is loaded with all wells containing matrix, push the lid all the way onto the slide, and incubate at 37 °C for 30-60 min until the matrix solidifies.",
    "NOTE: Do not let the matrix dry out. Add a small volume (2-3 mL) of PBS in the cap of a 50-mL conical tube near the slide in the incubator to reduce the risk of matrix drying.\n3. Protocol 2: Plating ECFCs on the Matrix\nRemove adherent ECFCs from tissue culture plates and collect in suspension\nObtain tissue culture plates containing the ECFCs plated the previous day (see section 1.1.9). Aspirate EGM2 media and wash adherent ECFCs once with 7 mL of PBS.\nAspirate PBS, add 2-3 mL of trypsin, and incubate adherent cells for 2-5 min at 37 °C.\nImmediately following incubation, add 3 mL of EGM2 and pipet up and down to dislodge all adherent cells. Transfer cell suspension to a 15-mL conical tube.\nRepeat steps 3.1.1-3.1.3 for the remaining three ECFC samples until all four cell samples are collected in suspension.\nPrepare master mixes\nCentrifuge all samples at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nAspirate supernatant and re-suspend cell pellets in 1-2 mL of EGM2.\nMix the cell suspension thoroughly and remove a small aliquot (20-40 μL) for counting.\nAdd equal parts trypan blue to the cell aliquot and pipette 10 μL onto a hemocytometer. Count the number of cells in the four primary quadrants of the hemocytometer.\n\t\tNOTE: Use both sides of the hemocytometer for all sample counts to increase accuracy.\nUsing the cell counts from above, calculate the volume of each cell sample that contains 1.4x104 cells. Mix all cell suspensions thoroughly and aliquot 1.4 x 104 cells into a fresh tube to prepare a master mix for each experimental condition. Add EGM2 media so that the final volume of each master mix is 175 μL.",
    "Mix each master mix by gently pipetting and aliquot 50 μL of master mix into individual wells on the slide.\n\t\tNOTE:All samples are plated in triplicate, with master mixes calculated for 3.5 wells to ensure sufficient volume for 3 wells.\nIncubate the slide\nIncubate the slide at 37 °C until it can be moved into the microscope chamber for imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: The time between plating and imaging should be as brief as possible to limit data loss during the early stages of vasculogenesis.\n4. Protocol 3: Microscope Setup and Image Acquisition\nNOTE: For our studies, Protocols 2 and 3 were conducted simultaneously by separate individuals. If Protocols 2 and 3 must be completed by the same individual, Protocol 3 Steps 4.1 and 4.2 below should be completed prior to initiating Protocol 2 above.\nTurn on the microscope and computer\nApproximately one to two hours prior to starting the experiment, turn on and preheat the stage top incubator to 37 °C, set the CO2 to 5%, and set the humidity to 85%. Fill the incubator's humidity reservoir, if empty.\nPlace an empty chambered slide in one of the two open positions, and fill with distilled water. Secure the feedback thermometer for chamber temperature control, if available.\n\t\tNOTE: If the feedback thermometer is available, use this \"incubator temperature\" to verify that the chamber has equilibrated.\nTurn on a secondary blower set to 39-42 °C to heat the slides from below and minimize condensation.\nAdd a second slide as a blank until the experimental slide can be added. This slide serves as a location placeholder for configuration of the image acquisition settings for individual wells during setup.",
    "Add water to the reservoir surrounding the wells on the second slide to mimic the conditions during the imaging experiment. The water surrounding the wells enables assessment of humidity during microscope setup and preheating.\n\t\tNOTE: Pre-equilibration of the stage-top incubator and secondary blower is critical for maintaining a stable culturing environment. Most live cell chamber controllers give real-time feedback of temperature, CO2, and humidity to assess the readiness of the system. Prior to continuing, check for the accumulation of humidity on the slide and excessive drying of the reservoir as filled in 4.1.5. Humidity may need to be adjusted if there is excessive drying or condensation in the chamber. To increase the humidity, add wipes wetted with distilled water. To decrease condensation, either decrease the humidity setting as adjusted in 4.1.1, or as condensation could be a sign of low temperature, check the chamber temperature settings and the positioning of the secondary blower.\nConfigure basic image acquisition settings during equilibration.\n\tNOTE:Image acquisition is configured through software that controls the stage, shutter, and camera. A multidimensional setup tool is the easiest way to configure the software. Furthermore, the software will need to have autofocus routines to ensure focus control over the duration of the experiment.\n\t\nUse the software to set multiple stage positions for each well. For this protocol, select the center of the wells.\nConfigure the image acquisition such that at each stage position, the entire well is imaged. For example, use a tilescan with 10-20% image overlap and approximately 5 x 5 fields, depending upon camera and final magnification.\nConfigure the time lapse for imaging every 15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Using the configuration outlined in this protocol, all 15 wells of the slide are imaged within a 15 min interval.\nLoad the experimental slide",
    "Following equilibration of the incubator chamber, replace the blank slide with the experimental slide.\n\t\tNOTE:An equilibrated chamber will have stable temperature, CO2, and humidity for at least 20 min. Once the experimental slide is ready, it is imperative that steps are completed quickly to minimize the \"dead-time\" between plating and the initial time point captured by the microscope. Furthermore, to facilitate comparison between imaging experiments, this time should be consistent. In these experiments, all steps outlined in Protocol 3 Section 4.3 required approximately 30 min to complete.\nRemove slide lid and add water to the reservoir surrounding the wells on the slide.\n\t\tNOTE: Lid is removed for the duration of the imaging experiment.\nConfigure final image acquisition settings\nPlace the CFI Plan Fluor DL 10X objective in position and select the Ph1 phase ring on the condenser. With the first well in focus, adjust the diascopic light path for Köhler illumination and configure phase optics by checking alignment of phase ring in the condenser with the objective phase mask.\nConfigure the exposure time and adjust the lamp intensity for phase contrast, which is typically less than 500 ms.\nCycle through each stage position set in 4.2.1 and confirm that the center of the well is selected, and adjust it, if necessary.\nAt each stage position, focus on the cells plated in the well and set the stage position's z position used for imaging in the software.\nTest the autofocus mechanism for the microscope. If the autofocus is hardware based, ensure it is on and positioned correctly for all stage positions.",
    "NOTE:As the specimen and stage may drift vertically during the experiment, it is important that the software check the autofocus at each stage position and every time-point to ensure reliable imaging during the time-course. If possible, an autofocus position determined in the previous time point should be used as the starting point for the subsequent autofocus routine. This way, on-going drift can be adjusted for easily.\nReduce or extinguish the lights in the microscope room and start the imaging experiment.\n5. Protocol 4: Image Processing and Kinetic Analysis of Vasculogenesis (KAV)\nSave images from individual time points as an image stack for each well\n\tNOTE: Most software for image capture can export multipage tiffs (stacks) of time series. KAV is designed to work on datasets that may include multiple time points. Thus, analysis occurs on the entire image stack for a given stage position. If required, the image processing software can import single images from each time point to reconstruct an image stack.\nOpen the image processing software on the computer\nAdd KAV to the image processing software\nDrag the KAV file from a folder into the grey bar at the bottom of the software window. Click 'Save' to add the software to the list.\nOpen the image stack to be analyzed\nClick 'File' then 'Open' through the dropdown menu in the image processing software, or drag the image file into the grey bar as in step 5.3.1.\nConvert the images to 8 bit by clicking 'Image', 'Type', '8 bit'.\nCreate a region of interest (ROI)\nOpen the ROI Manager by clicking on 'Analyze' in the tool bar. Then select 'Tools' followed by 'ROI Manager'.",
    "Create a new ROI by clicking on the circle or rectangle selection tools in the Toolbar and drawing the desired selection area on the image. Click 'Add' in the ROI manager window to save that shape.\n\t\tNOTE: A previously created ROI can be opened by dragging saved ROIs (zipped folder) into the 'Drag and Drop' bar to open in Manager.\nClick on the ROI label listed in the ROI Manager to view it on image.\n\t\tNOTE: If the ROI won't appear on the image, create a second ROI (any size/shape) and add it to the manager. Once both ROIs appear in the list, click back and forth between the two and the desired ROI will appear on the image.\nAlign the ROI if needed. Once the ROI is in place on the image in the desired location, go to the Menu and click 'Edit' then 'Clear Outside'. This will delete the image data outside of the ROI (useful for non-rectangular shapes) for every image in the stack.\n\t\tNOTE: You can also click on 'Image' and 'Crop' if you are using a rectangularly shaped ROI.\nRun the KAV software\nClick 'Plug-ins' in the menu bar.\nSelect the 'Analyze Network' Plug-in. This will open up a window with options to alter the settings in the Plug-in.\nChange the thresholding method using the drop down arrow.\nOnce all of the appropriate settings are selected, click 'OK' to initiate software processing.\n\t\tNOTE: Appropriate settings are determined through visualization of skeleton and mask renditions generated by KAV, which are indicative of the accurary of the software to identify and discern cells and networks from background in the phase contrast image.\nSave the KAV-generated data",
    "Once the plug-in has finished the analysis, two windows will pop-up on the screen including a data table with numerical values and a stack of fused images depicting skeleton and mask renditions.\nSave the numerical values by navigating to the upper left corner of the data table and clicking 'Edit' then 'Copy' or 'Cut' to paste values into an excel spreadsheet.\nClick on the fused skeleton and mask image. Save the fused skeleton/mask image stack as a Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) file by clicking 'File,' 'Save As,' 'TIFF.'\nSave the cropped phase contrast image stack (created using ROI) by clicking 'File,' 'Save As,' 'TIFF.'\nClick on the ROI Manager window and select the ROI used to crop the images. Click 'More' followed by 'Save' to save the ROI for future use.\n\t\tNOTE: Using the same ROI will help maintain consistency across analyses."
