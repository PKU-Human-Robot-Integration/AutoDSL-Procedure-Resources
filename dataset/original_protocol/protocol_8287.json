    "All procedures were approved by the animal research ethics committee at University of Barcelona.\nNOTE: X. tropicalis and X. laevis tadpoles are reared according to standard methods13,14. Tadpole water is prepared by adding commercial salts (see Table of Materials) to water obtained by reverse osmosis. Conductivity is adjusted to ∼700 µS and ∼1,400 µS for X. tropicalis and X. laevis tadpoles, respectively. Larvae can be obtained either by natural mating or in vitro fertilization14. Embryos are dejellied with 2% L-cysteine prepared in 0.1x Marc's Modified Ringers (MMR). 1x MMR contains (in mM): 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, 0.1 EDTA, pH 7.8. Larvae are transferred after 2–3 days (stage 25) to 2 L tanks with tadpole water. When tadpoles reach stage 40 of the Nieuwkoop-Faber (NF) criteria15, they are placed in 5 L tanks and maintained at a density of 10 animals/L. Temperature is kept constant at 23–25 °C and 18–20 °C for X. tropicalis and X. laevis tadpoles, respectively. Animals found at stages 48–52 of the NF criteria are used for experiments.\n1. Transection of Olfactory Nerves\nPrepare an anesthetizing solution of 0.02% MS-222 in 50 mL of tadpole water at room temperature.\nPrepare a small tank (1–2 L) with tadpole water to allow recovery of animals after surgery.\nCut rectangular pieces of cellulose qualitative filter paper (4 cm x 3 cm, see Table of Materials).\nWet 2 pieces of cellulose qualitative filter paper in 0.02% MS-222 solution and place them under the dissecting scope.\nPick a tadpole from the tank and immerse it into the anesthetizing solution. The animal stops swimming within 2–4 min and does not react to mechanical stimuli applied at the tail level using tweezers.",
    "Place the anesthetized tadpole on the rectangular pieces of filter paper. Position the animal with its dorsal side facing upward, so brain structures can be visualized.\nUsing vannas scissors (see Table of Materials) cut one or both olfactory nerves (depending on the type of assay to be carried out). Transect a single nerve for experiments that require an internal control of nerve injury.\nFor behavioral experiments, transect both nerves in order to suppress all odorant information arriving to the olfactory bulb. The efficiency of sectioning of olfactory nerves can be easily observed under the dissecting scope; however, pigmentation or animal position can be limiting factors.\nNOTE: (Optional) The best way to certify the validity of the procedure is using transgenic tadpoles that express fluorescent reporters on their nervous system (see representative results). To this aim, it is necessary to use a dissection scope equipped with fluorescence (Figure 1). If only wild-type animals are available, tracing with CM-diI can be employed. Follow protocol 2 (see below) to inject a 0.5 mg/mL solution of CM-diI prepared in 0.3 M sucrose in the nasal capsule. See 16 for details on preparation and storage of CM-diI. Leakage of dye out of the principal cavity must be minimize. To this aim, it is necessary to modify the pressure of injection and the opening of micropipettes. Fluorescence at the level of the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb becomes obvious 24 h after application of CM-diI. The present work uses labeling with CM-diI just to certify the transection procedure; however, this method can also be used to obtain morphological information of olfactory glomeruli using conventional histological procedures.",
    "Transfer animals to the recovery tank. Tadpoles should recover normal swimming within ~10 min. Perform a careful inspection for the presence of hemorrhages, which are expected in ~1% of animals subjected to surgery.\nEuthanize injured animals in a 0.2% MS-222 solution.\n2. Labeling of Olfactory Receptor Neurons with Fluorescent Calcium Indicators\nPrepare a solution containing 12% Calcium Green-1-dextran (see Table of Materials), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM NaCl17. Store the solution at -20 °C or at -80 °C if it is not to be used within a month.\nPrepare glass pipettes with tip openings ~1–2 µm (similar diameter to microelectrodes used for patch-clamp experiments) for microinjection using a micropipette puller (see Table of Materials).\nCalibrate the volume of microinjections. Using distilled water, adjust pressure and injection time in order to obtain injection volumes of 0.15–0.3 µL.\nNOTE: A simple procedure consists in counting the number of pulses required to empty a pipette filled with 1 µL of water. Typical parameters are a pressure of 30 psi and 50 ms injection time.\nPlace a pipette in the microinjector and load it with ~2 µL of calcium green-1 dextran solution.\nPrepare a tadpole following steps 1.1 to 1.6.\nMove the tip of the pipette into the principal cavity of the nasal capsule.\nNOTE: See Figure 2A describing the location of olfactory pathways in a Xenopus tadpole.\nUsing settings obtained in 2.3, deliver a couple of puffs. Restrict dye presence to the nasal capsule.\nLet the tadpole rest for 2–3 min. Using a Pasteur pipette, pour drops of 0.02% MS-222 solution on the more caudal parts of the animal to avoiding drying.\nTransfer the animal to the recovery tank.\nNOTE: It should recover normal swimming within ~10 min. Manipulation of animals might cause injuries.",
    "Euthanize tadpoles that do not recover normal swimming behavior 15 min after injection using a 0.2% MS-222 solution.\nObserve fluorescence at the level of the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb on the day after injection.\n3. Preparation of Tadpoles for Live Imaging of Presynaptic Responses\n24–48 h before conducting the experiment, coat 4–6 Petri dishes of 35 mm diameter with silicone elastomer (e.g., Sylgard). Once the elastomer has polymerized, fabricate a rectangular well to fit the tadpole.\nNOTE: Typical dimensions for X. tropicalis tadpoles found at NF stages 48–52 are 10 mm x 4 mm.\nPrepare 100 mL of a 160 µM to 1 mM amino acid solution acting as an odorant stimulus for tadpoles. The solution can contain a mixture of several amino acids: methionine, leucine, histidine, arginine and lysine. Dilute amino acids in Xenopus Ringer's solution, composed of (in mM): 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 240 mOsm/kg, pH 7.8. Ensure that pH is maintained at 7.8.\nFill an elevated reservoir with 20 mL of the amino acid solution. Connect the reservoir with polyethylene tubing to a 28 G capillary tube (see Table of Materials) placed above the nasal capsule.\nNOTE: The capillary tube is mounted on a micromanipulator (see Table of Materials). Air bubbles must be absent from the perfusion system.\nAchieve temporal precision in applying the amino acid solution using the transistor-transistor logic (TTL) control of solenoid pinch valves (see Table of Materials). A stimulator is used to generate TTL pulses (see Table of Materials). Check the temporal precision to deliver the odorant solution by changing the duration of TTL pulses, i.e., 0.1 to 1 s.\nFill another elevated reservoir with 100 mL of Xenopus Ringer's solution.",
    "Anesthetize a tadpole and place it under the dissecting scope (steps 1.1 to 1.6).\nPrepare a tadpole for imaging. If albino tadpoles are available proceed to step 3.9, otherwise remove the skin above the olfactory bulb because it contains melanocytes that impair imaging (step 3.8).\nNOTE: There are two ways to perform the experiment depending on the pigmentation of the animal. It is preferable to use albino animals. Albino strains are available for X. laevis and albino X. tropicalis lines have recently been generated by CRISPR-Cas9 12 or TALENs18.\nUsing vannas scissors, make a lateral incision on the tadpole skin on the edge of the central nervous system. Make the cut should be made at the level of the olfactory bulb and never reaching the position of tectum, which can be easily identified by the location of the optic nerve.\nPinch the cut skin using tweezers and pull it over the nervous system. Verify successful removal by the absence of melanocytes above the olfactory bulb. Keep the animal moist by pouring drops of 0.02% MS-222 solution using a Pasteur pipette.\nPlace the tadpole into the well of the coated dish (see Table of Materials). Put a glass coverslip coated with high vacuum grease above the animal. Position the coverslip to cover the top of the tectum to the end of the tail.\nEnsure that the olfactory bulb and placodes remain exposed to the extracellular medium. Keep the tadpole immobile during imaging. Fill the Petri dish with Xenopus Ringer's solutioncontaining 100 µM tubocurarine (see Table of Materials) to prevent muscle contractions.\nNOTE: Tubocurarine is stored in aliquots at -80 °C no longer than 6 months.",
    "Place the dish holding the tadpole under an upright microscope. Connect the reservoir containing Xenopus Ringer's solution with the dish using polyethylene tubing (see Table of Materials) for continuous perfusion of Xenopus Ringer's solution to keep the animal alive for >1 h.\nNOTE: Mini magnetic clamps (see Table of Materials) are very useful to stably connect tubing to the dish. Perfusion and suction tubes must be located in ~180° angle.\nStart perfusing Xenopus Ringer's solution. Maintain the level of the solution in the dish constant throughout the experiment. Continuously evaluate tadpole viability by observing blood circulation through the vessels.\n4. Live Imaging of Presynaptic Ca2+  Changes in Olfactory Glomeruli\nNOTE: The imaging procedure is described for wide-field microscopy but could be easily adapted to a confocal microscope by adjusting the acquisition settings. Imaging should be carried out in an upright microscope mounted on an anti-vibration table.\nVisualize the tadpole with a low magnification objective, for example 5x.\nMove the micromanipulator axes to place the capillary delivering the odorant solution on the top of one nasal capsule forming a 90° angle with the olfactory nerve. The flow of odorant solution above the olfactory bulb should be avoided because it might cause turbulences that distort imaging.\nFind the olfactory bulb located ipsilaterally to the nasal capsule (subject to stimulation) using a high magnification, long working distance, water immersion objective: 60Xx, 0.9 N.A.\nCheck the fluorescence emission by eye. Glomerular structures should be obvious (Figure 2B).\nPerform live acquisition with a camera suitable for calcium imaging. Define a box containing the entire olfactory bulb, typically of 256 x 256 or 512 x 512 pixels. Set the acquisition frame rate acquisition to 20–40 Hz. Adjust the gain, so that the values of basal fluorescence are ~20% of saturation. Acquire a 5 s video.",
    "Visualize the movie. Check image focus, the absence of movement artifacts and regions containing saturated pixels. Typical fluorescence values of glomerular regions should be of 5,000–20,000 a.u. if using a 16-bit camera. Proceed to the next step if imaging conditions are optimal. Repeat step 4.6 if needed to improve the image quality or adjust gain settings.\nStart a time-lapse acquisition to record responses evoked by olfactory stimuli.\nNOTE: Precise application of the odorant solution is controlled by TTL stimuli. A typical experiment contains a baseline period of 4 s, followed by stimulation times ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 s and a recovery period of 6–10 s.\nPerform repetitive stimulations of odorants for time intervals >2 min. Set the flow rate to 1–1.5 mL·min-1. Since the global perfusion is on during all experiments, locally applied amino acids are washed out.\nNOTE: The volume of solution in the dish is ~3 mL.\nImage analysis\nDetection of responses\n\t\t\nExport movies to ImageJ.\nNOTE: The goal is detecting the presence of glomerular regions responding to stimuli.\nTransform the raw sequence of fluorescence images to a ΔF/F0 movie. Measure relative changes in basal fluorescence according to the following relationship: (F-F0)/F0, where F0 indicates baseline fluorescence levels.\nDraw regions of interest (ROI) around areas showing putative fluorescence increases during stimulation and record their position in the ROI manager (Figure 2E). Draw an ROI to detect background fluorescence levels in an area devoid of glomerular structures.\nQuantification of responses.\n\t\t\nPlace the defined ROIs in the raw sequence of fluorescence images. Obtain the mean gray value of selected ROIs for each frame. Transfer the sequence of values obtained to an analysis program (e.g., Igor Pro).",
    "Subtract background fluorescence, and then calculate ΔF/F0 changes for each ROI (Figure 2F). Plot the increases in ΔF/F0 for each one of the ROIs selected. Calculate the standard deviation of basal ΔF/F0 (before stimulation).\nNOTE: A positive response is considered if increases in ΔF/F0 obtained during stimulation are larger than 2 standard deviations of basal values.\n5. Olfactory-guided Behavior Assay\nNOTE: A schematic diagram of the setup for performing the assay is shown in Figure 3.\nMake small holes to fit 1.57 mm O.D. x 1.14 mm I.D. tubing in the upper part of each well of a 6-well dish. Insert the tubing and seal using an epoxy adhesive (see Table of Materials).\nNOTE: The modified dish can be re-used many times after thorough wash with distilled water.\nPrepare 50 mL of an amino acid solution containing methionine, leucine, histidine, arginine and lysine (see step 3.2 for details). The concentrations can range from 160 µM to 1 mM. Place 20 mL of the solution in an elevated reservoir.\nDo not feed tadpoles for at least 12 h before the assay. Take 6 tadpoles from their housing tank and place them in 2 L of clean tadpole water to minimize the exposure to odorants.\nPlace the modified 6 wells dish on a white LED-transilluminator (Figure 3).\nCouple the perfusion inlets to the reservoir containing the amino acid solution using a manifold (see Table of Materials). Check the perfusion system and eliminate air bubbles. Fill the 6 wells simultaneously. Adjust the height of the reservoir to allow the delivery of ≥5 mL of odorant solution within ~30 s.\nNOTE: Wash each well 4 times with double distilled water after exposure to the odorant solution.\nFill each well with 10 mL of tadpole water. Place 1 tadpole/well. Leave to rest for >3 min.",
    "Set up image acquisition. Use a conventional CCD camera that can acquire images at ≥5 Hz. Connect the camera to a computer. Here, use a Zeiss MRC5 camera controlled by Zen software but other equivalent configurations can be used. If it is necessary to increase frame rate, apply pixel binning. Images should show the whole 6-well dish.\nStart image acquisition such that movies contain basal (30 s), stimulus (25–35 s) and recovery (30–60 s) periods.\nReturn animals from the 6 wells dish to tanks after imaging.\nAnalyze movies in ImageJ using plugins such as wrMTrck19,20 that provide multiple parameters associated to motility.\nTo prepare images for analysis, first select a well by drawing a rectangular ROI of 35 mm x 35 mm (Figure 4A). Obtain a background image by calculating the maximum projection of the whole sequence. It should display an image of the well without the tadpole.\nSubtract the maximum projection from the raw movie. Perform thresholding on the generated 32-bit movie and apply the wrMTrck plugin. Adjust WrMTrck parameters to reliably track animal movements. Transfer the obtained X,Y coordinates into an analysis program.\nUsing X-Y coordinates, calculate the Euclidean distance to the odorant source (perfusion inlet in the well), by applying the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58028/58028eq1.jpg\n\twhere os indicates the position of the odor source and tad indicates the tadpole position at a given time.
