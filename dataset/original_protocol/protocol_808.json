    "**A. Purify high-molecular weight \\(HMW) genomic DNA \\(gDNA)**\nTime: ~6 hrs\nThe substrate for SITE-Seq is high molecular weight \\(HMW) genomic DNA \\(gDNA). To obtain this use the QIAGEN Blood & Cell Culture DNA Maxi Kit.  2 x 10^8 cells will generate ~1mg of HMW gDNA. 10µg is required for each SITE-Seq sample. The following protocol details the procedure, which is per the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications: \n1. Use a 1 x107 cells/mL suspension. The following protocol is based on a 10mL suspension. Add 10mL ice-cold C1 Buffer, 30mL ice-cold molecular biology-grade water. Mix by inverting the tube several times. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes.\n  2. Centrifuged lysed cells at 4°C for 15 min at 1,300 x g. Discard the supernatant.\n  3. Wash with 2mL of ice-cold C1, with 6mLof ice-cold water. Resuspend by vortexing.\n  4. Centrifuge again at 4°C for 15 min at 1,300 x g, discard the supernatant.\n  5. Resuspend in 10mL G2 by vortexing for 10-30s at maximum speed. Completely resuspension is critical for good flow rate in later steps.\n  6. Add 200µL of QIAGEN Protease and incubate at 50°C for 30-60 minutes.\n  a. A full 60-minute incubation is recommended if suspension was not homogenous after vortexing in step 5.\n7. Equilibrate a Qiagen Genomic-tip 500/G with 10mL of QBT, allow to empty by gravity flow.\n  8. Vortex the digested suspension sample \\(from step 6) for 10s at maximum speed and apply it to the equilibrated Genomic-tip column, allow to empty by gravity flow.\n  a. If the column becomes clogged and gravity flow stops, positive pressure may be used, but do not allow the flow rate to exceed 20-40 drops/min.\n9. Wash the Genomic-tip column twice with 15mL QC each.\n  10. Elute the genomic DNA with 15mL of Buffer QF.",
    "a. Preheating the QF to 50°C will increase yields.\n11. Precipitate the DNA by adding 10.5mL of room temperature isopropanol to the eluted DNA. Mix by inverting the tube 10-20 times, immediately centrifuge at >5,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C\n  a. After mixing, a white, string-like precipitate should be visible floating in the sample.\n12. Remove the supernatant and wash with 4mL of cold 70% ethanol. Centrifuge again for 10 min at > 5,000 x g and remove supernatant.\n  13. Allow to air-dry for 5-10 minutes\n  14. Resuspend in 0.5-1mL of a suitable buffer \\(TE or 10mM Tris-Cl is acceptable), dissolve the DNA on a shaker overnight or at 55°C for 1-2 hours. Do not vortex.\n  \n**B. Quantification and Qualification of HMW gDNA with Gel Electrophoresis.**\nIt is necessary to confirm that the genomic DNA is intact and HMW \\(i.e. >50kb). This step details that procedure.\n1. Ensure that the genomic DNA is fully thawed and well mixed before handling. HMW gDNA is very viscous and easily sheared. Mix by inverting or pipetting up and down with a 1mL tip. \n  2. Prepare a 1% agarose gel by adding 0.5g to 50mL of 1x TAE buffer per gel. \n  3. Heat sample until agarose is in solution, swirl. After agarose is fully dissolved, add 10,000x SYBR Safe gel stain and pour the gel. Allow ~30 minutes to cool.\n  4. Load 10µL DNA ladder and 0.5-1.5µg of HMWgDNA mixed with loading dye.\n  5. Run the gel at 85-100V for ~1-2 hrs. See **Figure 1** for a representative gel.\n  \n<a href=\"#figures\" data-url=\"http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5449/original/gel_pic_fig1.png?1491886345\">See figure in Figures section.</a>\n**C. Digest high-molecular weight gDNA with RNP Complex.**",
    "This step details the digestion of HMW gDNA with a Cas9 RNP complex. The RNP concentration can be varied from 0.25-1,024nM, with a guide RNA:Cas9 ratio of at least 3:1. This protocol assumes a single-guide RNA \\(sgRNA):\n1. Make up 5x Cas9 Cleavage buffer \\(CCB) according to the following:\n  100mM HEPES, pH 7.4\n750mM KCl\n50mM MgCl2\n25% glycerol\n2.

Mix the diluted Cas9 from step 5 with the re-folded sgRNAs from step 4 and incubate at 37°C for 10 min.\n  7. Dilute the HMW gDNA to ~500 ng/µL and add 20µL to each RNP reaction.\n  8. Incubate cleavage reaction at 37°C for 4 hours.\n  a. At this point, the reaction can be held at 4°C overnight or proceed to step 9 for quenching\n9. Terminate the cleavage reaction by adding 6.8µL of Proteinase K/RNase A mix to each cleavage reaction according to the following:\n  Proteinase K \\(20mg/mL)  \\(0.5µL)\nRNAse A \\(20mg/mL)  \\(2.2µL)\n5x CCB Buffer           \\(1.4µL)\nWater     \\(2.7µL)\nTotal Mix \\(1 rxn)   \\(6.8µL)\n10.

Wash twice with 175µL freshly prepared 85% ethanol. Remove supernatant after 30 seconds for each wash.\n  6. Let ethanol evaporate for 10 minutes, until beads are dry.

Incubate the reaction mixture at room temperature for 5-10 min at RT.\n  9. Place the reaction mixture back on the magnetic stand, and allow beads to fully pellet.\n  10. Transfer 45µL of elution to a fresh tube. Continue to the dA tailing reaction step, or store the sample at -20°C until the next step can be started.\n  \n**E. dA-tailing reaction and adapter ligation 1.**\nThe dA-tailing reaction appends an adenine to the 3’ end of each DNA molecule, enabling subsequent adapter ligation.\n1.

SPRISelect DNA cleanup 2 \\(SPRI 2).**\nThis cleanup step is necessary to remove residual adapter 1 from the ligation reaction. Any residual adapter 1 will be carried through and can potentially form short functional molecules \\(adapter dimer) that can be detrimental to sequencing downstream. \n1. Add 0.5x volumes \\(25µL) of SPRISelect reagent to the sample.\n  a. Ensure that beads and gDNA are well mixed. Thorough mixing at this step is critical.\n2.

    "This step details the fragmentation of the adapter 1 ligated gDNA. The aim of this step is to fragment the library to an appropriate size for sequencing \\(~200-800bp). The results of the fragmentation will depend on the integrity of the HMW gDNA. It may be necessary to perform a series of trial reactions adjusting fragmentase concentrations and reaction times to optimize each gDNA set.\n1.
