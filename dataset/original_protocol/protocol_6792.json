    "Prepare CellsSeed Cells in 150 μl complete growth medium in a 96-well imagelock plate using a multi-channel pipette at a cell density that will reach up to 95% confluence overnight. In 96-well plates, it is advisable to exclude the outer wells from the experiment due to evaporation effects.Note: We seed 20,000 synovial fibroblasts or human dermal fibroblasts per well to reach full confluence within 24 h. Fill the outer wells with 300 μl PBS to counteract evaporation-effects in rest of the wells.Grow cells at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 overnight or until cells reach 95% confluence.Wash cells with 100 μl PBS twice using a multi-channel pipette.Starve cells with 100 μl FBS free culture medium in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 2 h to deplete growth factors.Note: In our setting, we starve cells for 2 h. Overnight starvation is commonly used for growth factor depletion. Starvation time may differ, depending on the experimental setting. Make scratchClean the wound maker in the wash boat for 5 minutes each in a series of four wash solutions (45 ml of each)0.5% Alconox1% Virkonsterile distilled water70% ethanolUse the IncuCyte® Wound Maker to create homogenous scratches(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7pMzJ1VIdA&feature=youtu.be[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7pMzJ1VIdA&feature=youtu.be])Remove top of the wound maker and place it in an empty wash boat.Insert plate into base plate holder and remove plate cover.Replace pin block by guiding the rear dowels of pin block into the rear holes of the base plate.Push and hold the black lever.Lift pin block while continuing to hold the black lever down.Discard the medium using multi-channel pipette without disturbing the scratch.Add 200 μl of Low-serum culture medium (2% FBS) containing the experimental treatments.Note: We treat our synovial fibroblasts or human dermal fibroblasts with anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) (Ossipova et al., 2014), control IgG, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and medium only.",
    "IncuCyte Zoom Scan setup (Figure 1A and Figure S1[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210222/3957 Supplementary file Figures S1 S3.docx])To avoid interrupting an ongoing scan, it is very important to check device status. Place a new plate only between scheduled scans. Do not eject door during scanning (Figure S2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210222/3957 Supplementary file Figures S1 S3.docx]).Place 96-well Imagelock plate and click ‘Schedule Scans’.Select the tray position of interest.Click ‘add vessel’ and select ‘96-well Essen Imagelock’ in Zoom software.Set scan type to ‘Scratch Wound’ with ‘Wide Mode’ and ‘Scan pattern’.Select ‘Phase contrast’ channels in Zoom software and Set plate layout as desired.Select the desired scan frequency and timing by, right clicking on the time base and selecting ‘Set Interval’. Scan interval depends on how many wells need to be scanned. We recommend a 1-2 h interval for a migration assay.Click ‘Apply’ button to finish setting. Any unapplied changes will not be performed.Plate Setup (optional) (Figure 1B)Under ‘properties’ panel, enter ‘label’, ‘cell type’, ‘passage’ and ‘notes’. In a high throughput assay, it is advisable to keep detailed information about experiments for further reference.Click ‘plate map’ and select ‘add’ in dropdown list to create assay layout. It is highly recommended to use plate map for further analysis.In plate map editor, click ‘NEW’ to create treatment.Select wells in the plate layout, enter concentration or dilution of treatment and add to selected wells.Apply step 4 to all treatments and complete plate map.Click ‘OK’ button to save plate map.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210320/20210320030747_9752.jpgFigure 1.

Steps 1 to 5 show the procedure to setup experiment properties, plate layout and treatment information.",
    "Data Collection and ProcessingIn side menu, select the experiment that needs to be analyzed.Create or Add image collection (Figure 2A).In ‘analysis job utilities’, click ‘Create or Add image collection’.Select several images to create image collection for algorithm definition. It is recommended to select from different locations from plate layout and different time points from scan time to represent whole experiment.Save the image collection with appropriate title.New processing definition (Figure 2B).In ‘analysis job utilities’, click ‘New processing definition’.Select the newly created image collection and continue to define the scratching mask.In left side menu, drag slide bar towards either ‘background’ or ‘cell’ to adjust segmentation.In clean up panel section, enter a certain number to fill up the holes between cells (optional).In filter section, select ‘min’ in ‘Area’ and enter a number to exclude cell debris in the image.Select ‘phase contrast’ in Image Channel, ‘scratching wound mask’ and ‘confluence mask’ in Analysis Mask.Click ‘preview’ to check the current processing definition and click ‘preview all’ to apply current definition to all images in collection.Adjust the definition until it fits most of images in collection and save it with a proper name.The processing definition can be applied for batch experiments.Launch Analysis Job (Figure 2C).In ‘analysis job utilities’, click ‘Launch Analysis Job’.In pop-up window, enter the name of the analysis.Select start and finish time point to define time range.Select wells in plate layout and click ‘Launch’ to start analysis job.Check analysis result in main menu in ‘search’ and under ‘analysis job’ tab.Data Export (Figure 2D)In side menu, select the experiment that needs to be exported.Select ‘Metrics’ panel, choose appropriate ‘phase metrics’ and click ‘Graph/Export’ button.In pop-up window, select ‘wells’ and ‘time points/time range’ and click ‘Data Export’ button.",
    "In ‘Export Metrics’ window, select ‘Layout’, ‘Destination’, ‘Other option’ and Click ‘Export’ button to export data for further analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210320/20210320031110_5981.jpgFigure 2.

Steps to select re-presentive images from all timepoints to create image collection. B. Steps to define confluence mask and wound mask for images from collection. C. Steps to launch analysis for selected plate and desired time range. D. Steps to export raw data.Lens Changing (Figure S3[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210222/3957 Supplementary file Figures S1 S3.docx])IncuCyte Zoom offers three different optical (4×, 10×, and 20× lens). To perform migration assay, it is essential to have 10× lens. To minimize the risk of conflict, changing lens is only available via administer account.In main menu, go to ‘Task list’, click ‘administer’ and select tab ‘optical configuration’.Follow the steps of ‘optics configuration’ to install new lens.Accept the change and create new schedule."
