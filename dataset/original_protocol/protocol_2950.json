    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRetro-orbital injection of CD45-PE antibodies, animal euthanasia and tissue harvesting\nTiming: 15–30 min per mouse\nThis section details steps progressing from r.o. injection of CD45-PE antibodies (or just 1× PBS) to blood and tissue collection.\nAnesthetize mouse using a veterinary anesthesia machine (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2693-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative images depicting animal anesthesia, r.o. injection, and cardiac puncture\n(A) Representative image of anesthesia machine.\n(B) Image showing mouse inside isoflurane anesthesia chamber. Bottom of chamber is lined with paper towels to collect any excrement.\n(C) Pre-injection: place mouse on its side with the r.o. cavity positioned upward.\n(D) Using thumb and index finger, stabilize the skull and apply gentle pressure on the fur/skin proximally located above and beneath the eye. This increases the perceived space between the eye and r.o. cavity allowing for easier injection.\n(E) Slowly insert the needle into the r.o. cavity until a slight bump is felt. This indicates the region where ophthalmic veins join. Depress plunger and deliver payload while applying slight downward pressure to penetrate/puncture the veins.\n(F) Upon delivery, transient eye “bulging” will be observed due to the increased liquid volume behind the eye. However, no leakage should be observed if injection was successful.\n(G) Image showing mouse position for dissection.\n(H) Exposure of mouse internal organs.\n(I) Image showing cardiac puncture with rib cage “flipped up” and stabilized using dissection pin.\nSet oxygen at maximal input.\nPlace mouse in anesthesia chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nInfuse anesthesia chamber with isoflurane (5%).\nAllow mouse to obtain a slow and steady breathing pattern (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nRemove animal from chamber and place on its side (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nUsing an insulin syringe with 28G needle, inject 100 μL of 1× PBS or CD45-PE antibodies (10 μg/mL) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D–1F).",
    "Note: Recommended maximum volume per mouse is 150 μL and 10 μL for adults and neonates,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] respectively. Please note that lower volumes such as 50 μL can be utilized reliably in adult mice.\nPlace animal into separate cage and start timer (previously set to 5 min).\nAt time, euthanize mouse via CO2 inhalation (primary form of euthanasia).\nAt cessation of breathing (∼30–60 s), remove animal from chamber and apply footpad pressure to verify non-responsiveness.\nUsing a dissection board (e.g., Styrofoam covered with tin foil and/or paper towels), position mouse with ventral side facing up and limbs spread (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nSpray mouse with 70% ethanol (EtOH).\nUsing scissors and forceps, expose internal organs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H) and perform cardiac puncture (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I) as secondary form of euthanasia.\nNote: To expose the heart, cut horizontally along bottom of ribs and diaphragm. Starting from the bottom of the rib cage, make 2 vertical cuts along the lateral portions, “flip up” the center portion of the rib cage and pin down to stabilize (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I). Cardiac puncture is performed by inserting a needle into the left ventricle and blood is harvested by slowly drawing back on the syringe plunger. To reduce the initial pressure vacuum, it is recommended to cycle the syringe plunger back and forth before ventricular insertion. This is especially important when using small bore needles such as a 28G insulin syringe.\nAlternatives: If cardiac puncture is not feasible, cervical dislocation can be performed as a means of secondary euthanasia. The mouse is then dissected, and blood collected following aortic bisection.\nTransfer blood to BD Vacutainer tube (or equivalent blood collection tube), invert multiple times to mix and place on ice.\nDissect organs of choice and place them on ice into individual 60-mm petri dishes filled with 5 mL of 1× PBS.",
    "Critical: Each experiment requires at least 1 animal that receives only 1× PBS. Samples derived from these mice will be essential in establishing background fluorescence in the PE channel upon flow cytometric analysis.\nCritical: Given the processing time for 1 mouse, it may be preferential to work in teams and assign 1 task per individual. If working with more than 2 mice, this will allow the team to stagger animals and perform the labeling and tissue harvesting in a more efficient manner.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Example of mouse undergoing isoflurane-based anesthesia, relevant to step-by-step method details step 1\n    \nTissue processing\nTiming: 1–2 h (dependent on number of animals)\nThis section details the processing of tissues post-harvesting.\nOrgan processing.\nSolid organ (e.g., spleen (SPL), thymus (THY)): In 60-mm petri dish with 5 mL 1× PBS, crush organ in between frosted ends of 2 microscope slides and transfer cell suspension to 15-mL conical tube on ice.\nBone marrow (BM): In 60-mm petri dish with 5 mL 1× PBS, cut off ends of bones with dissection scissors (or razor blade) and flush BM contents using 23G needle mounted onto a 5-mL syringe. Transfer cell suspension to 15-mL conical tube on ice.\nNote: We typically flush both femurs and tibias which provides more than adequate numbers of cells required for the analysis described below.\nCentrifuge samples at 600 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend cells in residual buffer (∼100 μL) by raking tubes against the rungs of a metal tube rack.\nAlternatives: Cells can also be resuspended by finger flicking of tubes combined with gentle pipetting.\nAdd 3 mL of RBC Lysis Buffer, mix thoroughly (e.g., pipetting or tube inversion) and place samples on ice for 3 min.",
    "For blood: 3 mL RBC Lysis Buffer is directly added to 100 μL of blood in 15-mL conical.\nNote: RBC lysis buffer is stored at 4°C for up to 6 months.\nNote: RBC lysis of peripheral blood within this protocol is usually incomplete. However, it reduces RBC density sufficiently to allow for flow cytometry. It also does not result in the potential loss of leukocytes which may occur when performing gradient-based separation (e.g., Percoll). If complete RBC lysis is desired, incubation times can be extended. However, this should be tested beforehand to verify that other cells are not inadvertently lysed as a result of increased time in the RBC Lysis Buffer.\nAdd 7 mL of 1× PBS to neutralize RBC lysis buffer.\nPass cells through a 40-μm cell strainer into new conical tube on ice.\nCount cells using Trypan Blue and a Hemocytometer.\nIn general, blood is omitted from this count as mouse blood normally contains from 2,000–10,000 leukocytes/μL.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Based upon this, the cellular concentration is too low to count using this method. If mouse blood cell counts are needed, samples can be run on complete blood cell (CBC) machine.\nFollow the below steps to counts cells:\nDilute samples 1:1 in Trypan Blue (this represents a 2-fold dilution).\nNote: If sample is too concentrated to count, dilute before adding Trypan Blue. Make a notation of this number as it will contribute to the final dilution factor used below to calculate cells/mL.\nNote: Trypan Blue is stored at 20°C–25°C for up to 1 year.\nLoad Hemocytometer with 10 μL of cells plus Trypan Blue mixture (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2693-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative counting of cells using a Hemocytometer",
    "Schematic shows loading of a Hemocytometer with a 1:1 mixture of cells:Trypan Blue (2-fold dilution). Live cells are “clear” and apoptotic cells are “blue”. Cells are counted in the upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right grids. If cells sit on edges of a grid, then only 2 out of 4 edges are considered as part of the grid. This is done to prevent over estimation of cell counts. In this schematic, cells on the top and right edges are considered as part of the grid. Cells/mL is calculated as follows: (total live cells counted / number of grids) × dilution factor × 10,000 = cells/mL. Using this example, cells/mL = (10 / 4) × 2 × 10,000 = 50,000. Figure made with BioRender.\nUsing a 20× microscope objective, count “clear” cells in 4 grids (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). “Clear” cells represent live cells while “blue” cells have taken up Trypan Blue dye as a result of a loss of membrane integrity. As such, “blue” cells are considered apoptotic.\nCalculate cells/mL using the following formula: (total live cells counted / number of grids) × dilution factor × 10,000 = cells/mL\nCalculate the total cells per organ/sample using the following formula: cells/mL × total sample volume = total cells per organ/sample\nCritical: The total cells per organ/sample will be used for 2 downstream calculations. (1) Determination of appropriate resuspension volume of samples before flow staining (relevant to step-by-step method details[href=https://www.wicell.org#step-by-step-method-details] step 20). (2) Calculating absolute numbers of populations of interest following flow cytometry (relevant to quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]).\nAlternatives: Cells can also be counted using automated systems such as a Countess.\nCentrifuge samples at 600 g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "Decant supernatant and resuspend in Flow Staining Buffer (FSB, 1× PBS + 0.1% BSA) at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/mL.\nDue to lower relative cellularity, blood samples can be resuspended in a minimal volume (e.g., 250 μL).\nNote: FSB is stored at 4°C for up to 6 months.\nCritical: Perform all steps in a biosafety cabinet using pre-sterilized solutions if cells will be subsequently cultured. Avoid direct light when processing samples to prevent potential quenching of PE fluorescence.\nPause point: Cells can be kept on ice for an extended period to allow for a break and/or preparation of downstream reagents.\nCell staining for flow cytometry\nTiming: 1–2 h (dependent on number of samples)\nThis section details the surface staining of cells for flow cytometric staining. However, these steps can be adapted to include intracellular staining when necessary (adds ∼1–2 h). For intracellular staining, it is recommended that antibodies and fluorochromes used for surface staining are tested for their resistance to fixatives as well as cell permeabilization reagents.\nPrepare Antibody Cocktail used for staining.\nAll antibodies are diluted in 1× PBS.\nNote: All antibody stock tubes are briefly vortexed, and touch spun before use to properly mix. All antibody stocks are opened only in a biosafety cabinet in the dark to preserve their sterility and prevent quenching of fluorescence.\nFor example, Antibody Cocktail is shown to stain 1 sample. However, it is normally scaled up to stain n + 1 samples.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2693_4.csv\nNote: If no dilution, the Volume Used per Sample corresponds to the volume taken straight from the antibody stock tube.",
    "Note:  Amount of Antibody Used (μg) is titrated for staining samples up to 5 × 106 cells. These amounts can be scaled up for staining of increased cell numbers (e.g., scale each antibody by a factor of 2 if staining 1 × 107 cells). Additionally, these amounts may vary depending on flow cytometer and laser setup/parameters. The Volume Used per Sample for each antibody is independent of the total cocktail volume. For example, addition of another antibody (e.g., 10 μL of diluted CD23) does not change the amount/volume of other antibodies within the total Antibody Cocktail.\nNote: Ex vivo CD45-APC staining is included to confirm CD45 surface expression on cell types of interest. Additional surface markers can be included to probe cellular phenotypes such as activation.\nVortex Antibody Cocktail to mix, briefly touch spin and hold on ice (in the dark) until use).\nAliquot 250 μL (5 × 106 cells) per sample to be stained into a 5-mL test tube on ice.\nFor blood, 250 μL will correspond to < 5 × 106 cells.\nAdd 55 μL of Antibody Cocktail to each a sample.\nNote: Fc receptor blocking is performed via the CD16/32-Unlabeled antibody included within the Antibody Cocktail.\nTouch vortex and incubate on ice (in the dark) for 30 min.\nAdd 3 mL FSB per sample and centrifuge at 600 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend in residual buffer (∼100 μL).\nAdd 250 μL of Flow Running Buffer (FRB, 1× PBS + 0.1% BSA + 2 mM EDTA).\nNote: The inclusion of EDTA in the FRB helps to reduce cell clumping. Volume of FRB is variable depending on the desired final cell density per sample.\nNote: FRB is stored at 4°C for up to 6 months.",
    "Strain samples into new 5-mL test tube via attached snap cap strainer.\nAlternatives: Generic nylon mesh or other single use strainers can be substituted.\nCritical: Cell straining is a key step to eliminate clumps that may have formed during sample processing. This helps to reduce the potential of clogging the flow cytometer during use.\nRun samples on flow cytometer and collect data for downstream analysis using FlowJo.\nNote: When running flow cytometry, setting the “stopping gate” based upon ASCs rather than total events will allow the user to ensure that enough ASCs are collected for reliable downstream analysis."
