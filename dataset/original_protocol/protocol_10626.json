    "1. Preparation of Measurement System\nPrewarm the array holder in an incubator to 37 °C before starting the experiment to prevent condensation.\nFill water casket of the incubator with distilled water to avoid drying of the wells.\nPerform all manipulations on cells and arrays in a laminar flow cabinet under sterile conditions.\n2. Preparation of Arrays and Inoculation of Cells\nNOTE: The ECIS arrays need to be cleaned and stabilized before an experiment to prevent electrode drift, to improve well-to-well reproducibility and signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore two options are available: A) pretreatment of the electrodes with L-cysteine and B) the stabilization function of the ECIS.\nOption A: L-cysteine is recommended as the most consistent pretreatment, but might in some special cases interact with protein coatings on the electrodes. The volumes presented are used for standard 8-well arrays.\nAdd 200 µl/well 10 mM L-cysteine. Cysteine cleans and modifies the electrode surface providing a high and reproducible electrode capacitance.\nIncubate 15 min at room temperature (RT).\nWash twice 500 µl/well with ultra-pure water (type 1). Do not use phosphate buffers, which can interfere with the adsorption of some proteins. Also avoid serum-containing solutions before coating, since the gold surface will adsorb the first macromolecules brought in contact.\nCoat with 200 µl/well warm 1% gelatin.\nIncubate 30 min at 37 °C.\nRemove gelatin, but don't let surface dry. This can damage the electrodes.\nWash once with ultra-pure water (type 1).\nAdd 400 µl/well complete cell culture medium (containing serum, antibiotics and all growth factors).\nSlide array into array holder and make sure that the array is positioned such that the nine gold square pads are properly contacted by the spring-loaded pogo pins and fix adjustment screw hand tight. Be careful with transparent arrays, the gold layer can easily be damaged.",
    "Open the measurement software and press Setup followed by Check in the \"Collect Data\" section to perform a quick impedance measurement of each individual well. The resulting values are the measurement baseline and will automatically be stored in the \"Comments\".\nThe well check will automatically determine the type of ECIS arrays used. Verify the selected arrays in the \"Well Configuration\" section.\nThe array diagram lights up green for properly connected wells and red for empty or incorrect connected wells. Still, always make sure that the arrays were placed correctly in the holder.\n\tNOTE: If cleaning and coating were successful the 8W1E ECIS arrays have a capacitance of about 5 nF and the 8W10E arrays of 50 nF, which results in a baseline resistance of about 2,000 and 200 Ω, respectively.\nRemove array from holder.\nSeed cells as a single cell suspension in 400 µl/well complete cell culture medium.\nOption B: The stabilization function of the ECIS can be used as an alternative or in combination with the L-cysteine treatment and if problems with electrode drift or large differences in well-to-well resistance and capacitance occur.\nPerform cysteine treatment (optional) and precoat electrodes with protein (optional).\nAdd 200 µl/well of complete medium to each well and place the array in the array holder.\nOpen measurement software and press Setup followed by Check to ascertain the array is properly connected and to measure initial Z, R, and C.\nStabilize the electrodes by pressing Stabilize in the \"Collect Data\" section. The ECIS will apply a high current (ca. 3 mA), high frequency (64 kHz) pulse to clean the electrodes.\nCheck electrodes again. Capacitance should be increased and resistance values should be in a comparable range.\nIf capacitance and resistance values are still not satisfactory, repeat the stabilization.",
    "Remove array from the holder and inoculate cells.\n3. Setting up Measurement Software and Data Acquisition\nPlace the array in the array holder as described before.\nOpen measurement software and press the Setup button in the \"Collect Data\" section to connect the ECIS software to the ECIS instrument and run another well Check.\nVerify the selected arrays in the \"Well Configuration\" section.\nSelect the wells to be measured in the \"Well Configuration\" section.\nSelect the measurement mode from the \"Collect Data\" options:\n\t\nFor a time series at a fixed frequency, select Single Freq. / Time (SFT) and choose the measurement frequency from the drop down menu.\nFor measurement of electrode coverage and modeling of Rb and Alpha, select Multiple Freq. / Time (MFT). The ECIS device will measure automatically at all available frequencies.\nFor micromotion (see data analysis) select Rapid Time Collect (RTC) and adjust measurement frequency and sampling frequency. Here the standard temporal resolution is one sample per sec (1 Hz), but sampling frequency can also be increased to track fast changes in impedance up to 25 Hz (for the Z-Theta). Important note: in RTC mode only a single well is measured.\n\t\tNOTE: If micromotion need to be measured in several wells subsequently, go to Help > Show expert toolbar/menu items > Acquire > Multi-Well RTC. Specify the Time limit (hr) in the Collect Data section; the ECIS will now measure the selected wells in numerical order. After starting the measurement the software will ask to specify the numbers of cycles. Enter the value for how often the measurement needs to be repeated.\nFor SFT and MFT, select the time Interval (sec) between measurements or if data need to be acquired as fast as possible leave this option unchecked.",
    "NOTE: To acquire data the ECIS device uses a multiplexer to switch from one well to another with a minimum SFT acquisition rate of 0.25 sec and 7.5 sec for MFT. Meaning the interval is dependent on number of selected wells and frequencies. For measurements on slow proliferating cells or a simple recording of resistance vs. time, use intervals of 600 sec or more.\nPress Start, name the file and select location to store the data.\n\tNOTE: File size should not be a problem, since ECIS data are saved in a kind of plain text format called *.abp, which never exceeds several hundred MB even with all measurement frequencies and number of wells selected.\nStop run by pressing Finish.\n4. Medium Change and Cell Manipulation\nPress Pause, this will stop the data acquisition, but continue to run the experimental clock.\nRemove the array from the holder and manipulate it under a laminar flow bench (i.e. change medium).\nPlace array back in the holder and either click Check Connection or Resume Experiment to continue data acquisition. The measurement software will place a time mark in the data set.\n5. Acute Stimulation During Data Acquisition\nNOTE: A second option is to manipulate the cells during data acquisition to follow immediate changes. This is only possible when samples don't needs to be sterile in the further course of the experiment.\nAdd the stimulus directly to the well and make sure to mix careful with a 200 µl pipette.\nMark time point manually by pressing Mark and add a comment.\n6. Electrical Wounding",
    "NOTE: Finding the right settings for the used cell type is key for electrical wounding. If wounding is too short this can result in insufficient removal of cells, whereas if wounding is too long and/or rough this can damage the electrodes (especially on the transparent arrays). Therefore, several short wounding pulses are recommended. For HUVEC cultures two 10-20 sec long wounding pulses of 5 V at 60 kHz each have been found optimal using the ECIS 1600R. In general it is recommended to use high frequencies >20 kHz to maintain uniform high fields across the cells and to avoid any damage to the electrodes.\nPerform wounding during an active ECIS measurement.\nEnable Wound / Electroporate Setup, then click Wound and fill in the time (sec), wound voltage (V for 1,600 R) or current (µA for Z and Z-Theta) and frequency (Hz). The displayed default values are based on the type of array and ECIS device.\nSelect the wells to wound in the \"Well Configuration\" section. Only the checked wells will be wounded.\nEnable Delay Until Hour and fill in the delay time to activate the delay wound function. This function can be stopped at any time by pressing Stop or applying a wound manually. Only one delay command can be active at a time.\nPress Activate and click OK in the pop-up window to start wounding.\nMake sure that the resistance signal drops to the offset impedance after wounding, otherwise repeat the wounding.\n7. Data Analysis\nData representation and exporting.\n\t\nFinish measurement or load data set via File -> Open.\nSelect wells to be displayed from the \"Well Configuration\" window. Group individual wells to present the average.\nChose parameter to be displayed from the upper toolbar (Z, R or C).",
    "Select graph type from the upper toolbar (T = time, F = frequency, 3D = waterfall blot).\nDefine graph offset and range with the sliders below the graph window or fill in the exact values in the adjacent controls.\nChose from the basic \"Time-Series Options\" in the \"Analyze\" section to perform standard deviation, running average or normalization of the data.\nActivate Expert Toolbar in the Help menu for more advanced operations like Nyuist plot and Fourier transformation.\nUse \"Display Options\" in the \"Analyze\" section to define range of x- and y-axes and export graph.\nExport selected data to an Excel file via File -> Export Data -> To Excel (Selected) and use a third party software of choice for in depth analysis, statistics and representation as needed.\nModeling of Rb and Alpha.\n\tNOTE: For modeling it is recommended to use a cell-free, medium filled well as reference.\n\t\nFinish MFT measurement or load MFT data set.\nIf a cell-free reference well is available press either Find to automatically select the reference value or Set to select the cell free time point manually from \"Freq. Scan Modeling\" in the \"Analyzing\" section.\nIf there is no cell-free reference, import a reference value from another data set. Open the reference data set (make sure that the same array and medium was used) and use Find or Set to select the reference value. Then navigate to the measured data and press Get.\nIf there is no cell-free reference data set available use the factory default.\nPress Model to start the calculations. Modeling might take several minutes dependent on the size of the data set.\nCalculation of micromotion.\n\tNOTE: This calculation is not part of the measurement software, but can be performed with any signal processing software.\n\t\nFinish RTC measurement or load RTC data set.",
    "Normalize data set by the averaged resistance of the entire period.\nBreak data set into segments with a length of 256-data points and clean each segment by a Hanning window.\nRun a 256-point Fourier transformation and average resulting frequency spectra to a single-sided 129-point power spectrum to minimize random noise and enhanced the biological signal.\nPlot frequency against amplitude in a log-log graph and apply least square linear fit.\nThe slope of the linear fit is a measure of overall noise in the signal and thereby micromotion of the cells."
