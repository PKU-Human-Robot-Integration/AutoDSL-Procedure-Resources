    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nReversible AFM-Chip assembly\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step will produce reversible AFM-Chip assembly to be used for further antibody immobilization on glass surface.\nBring the cleaned PDMS chips (channel sides facing down) and APTES-silanized glass slides (crossed sides facing up) into contact at 23°C and under atmospheric pressure to enable reversible AFM-Chip assembly.\nNote: The reversible AFM-Chip assembly occurs through physical bondage of silanols (Si−O-) on PDMS with protonated nitrogens on silanized glass slide via NH−O hydrogen bonds (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: Misalignment in this step may cause the channels to leak or not to fit into glass slide properly.\nGently press on the PDMS chips to make sure that the surfaces of the AFM-Chip are well-bonded.\nCritical: Avoid pressure on the channel areas, which could collapse channels and damage the structure of HB elements.\nKeep the AFM-Chips in a vacuum desiccator for 15 min to allow the trapped gas bubbles present between the surfaces to escape passively.\nAntibody immobilization on glass\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step will decorate the glass slides with antibodies at a high density while preserving their activity.\nCritical: Handle all chemicals in a fume hood.\nPause point: After each step below, droplets of PBS need to be pipetted on the inlet and outlet ports of the AFM-Chips to prevent any liquid evaporation within the channels during incubation times. Post incubations, AFM-Chip channels need to be manually flushed with 100 μL PBS using syringes so that unbound molecules/antibodies are removed.\nPrepare a 3 mg/mL solution of BMPS in PBS in a glass vial. Mix the solution using a vortex mixer for 5 s.\nPause point: Compared to other solvents (e.g., toluene, methanol, acetonitrile), BMPS is not completely dissolved in PBS because of its non-polar nature.",
    "Fill a glass syringe with 100 μL BMPS solution (3 mg/mL in PBS) and manually pass it through channels of AFM-Chip using polyethylene tubes. Incubate the silanized glass surfaces for 30 min at 23°C.\nNote: BMPS is an intermediate linker molecule that provides an excellent route to covalently tether antibodies to silanized glass surfaces in an oriented fashion and at high concentrations through site-specific coupling (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B): succinimide group to couple with the reactive silane amino groups through an amide (N−C=O) linkage, and maleimide group to couple with the sulfhydryl groups of antibodies through a thiol (C−S) linkage.\nNote: Due to its short spacer-arm length of 5.9 Å in comparison with a typical antibody size of ∼10 nm, BMPS forms a rigid covalent bridge between the amine-terminated APTES on the surface and the sulfhydryl groups on antibodies.\nDilute concentrated antibody solutions (EpCAM, PSMA, and PSA) to 10 μg/mL using PBS in Eppendorf tubes under biosafety cabinet. Mix the solution using a vortex mixer for 5 s.\nCritical: For multiplex capture of prostate cancer CTCs, repeat steps 6 and 7 three times, each time using separate AFM-Chips, to immobilize anti-EpCAM, anti-PSMA, and anti-PSA antibodies.\nNote: Most antibodies are expected to be stable when stored in PBS (pH 7.2–7.6) for long time (weeks). Therefore, the excess antibody solutions can be stored at 4°C and reused multiple times when needed.\nNote: 10 μg/mL antibody concentration used in functionalizing the AFM-Chip is sufficient to fully cover the glass surface within its 16 channels in an oriented fashion. Here, the high density and activity of antibodies aim to increase the CTC capture yield, while minimizing the nonspecific binding of other cells and thus increasing the CTC purity rate. However, it should also be noted that proper antibody concentration is subject to characterization and biological testing.",
    "Fill a glass syringe with 100 μL antibody solution per AFM-Chip and manually pass it through their channels using polyethylene tubes. Incubate the maleimide-activated surfaces for 45 min at 23°C.\nNote: During antibody immobilization, the pH of PBS is expected to be within the physiological range (7.2–7.6), thus providing stability to antibodies throughout their incubation time.\nNote: The specific binding of antibodies is only on the glass substrate through maleimide interaction (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). The top and side walls of the channels are expected to have minimal amount of antibodies physically adsorbed through non-specific interactions.\nPrepare 1% (v/v) BSA solution in PBS in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Transfer it to a 100 μL syringe and manually pass it through AFM-Chip channels using polyethylene tubes. Allow for 20 min to block the non-specific binding sites on microfluidic channel surfaces.\nNote: BSA is used to block the remaining nonspecific binding sites on the substrate surface, primarily available due to protonated amines formed during the APTES silanization process.\nStore the AFM-Chips at 23°C until the cell capture experiments.\nAntibody coverage characterization\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step will verify that immobilized antibodies maintain a high binding efficiency with antigens involving both arms of the Y-shaped antibodies.\nCritical: Handle all chemicals in a fume hood.\nPause point: This section is optional. However, antibody coverage characterization is recommended to verify the chemisorption and orientation of each antibody functional group to maleimide-activated glass substrate as control.\nManually pass 1 mg NHS-fluorescein in 400 μL of DMF through AFM-Chip channels using a syringe and allow incubation for 60 min in the dark at 23°C.\nNote: Succinimide groups of NHS-fluorescein bind specifically with the N-terminal groups of antibodies, which are located at the ends of their Fab arms.",
    "Manually flush the channels with 100 μL PBS using a syringe to remove unbound dyes. Detach the glass substrate from the PDMS and immerse them in Petri dishes containing dye-free PBS.\nCarry out imaging of glass slides with inverted fluorescence microscope (e.g., Nikon Ti) using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter cube and through a 10× air objective (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nCalculate the corrected total fluorescence of images following an algorithm that scales and shifts each pixel value of the input image to match its mean and standard deviation to those of target images (corrected).\nNote: In processing the fluorescence images, use a G’MIC color transfer filter to transfer the color characteristics of one image to another, and analyze images in ImageJ to calculate the corrected total fluorescence of images using\n  IntDen  =    ( Area )    ×    ( MGVSample )   \nwhere IntDen (Integrated Density) = a measure of “grayness” on an individual selection, Area = area of interest, MGVSample (Mean Gray Value of the sample) = the sum of the gray values of all the pixels in the selection divided by the number of pixels. With this, the corrected total fluorescence (CTF) is calculated using.\n  CTF  =  IntDen −  ( Area  ×  MGVBackground )    =    ( Area )    ×    ( MGVSample − MGVBackground )  .  \nBlood processing using AFM-Chip\nTiming: 5 h\nThis step will demonstrate capturing clinical CTCs from prostate cancer patients’ whole blood samples.\nPause point: Obtain immunization against blood-borne diseases, including Hepatitis B and Tetanus. Obtain IRB ethical approvals from your institution and the collaborating hospital, and signed consents from volunteering human subjects after explaining the study. Collection and use of blood must conform to all relevant governmental and institutional regulations and IRB guidelines.",
    "Critical: Treat all blood as potentially infectious. In case of blood spill, ensure that the infected surface is thoroughly wiped with ethanol. After experiments, properly dispose the glass slides along with all other experimental components used in the capture/characterization of CTCs.\nCritical: Collect the blood samples in EDTA tubes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A) and process them within 5-6 h after collection. Place the EDTA tubes on digital rocker at a slow mode while performing cell capture experiments.\nNote: For multiplex capture of prostate cancer CTCs, repeat the below steps 14–22 at once using AFM-Chips activated with anti-EpCAM, anti-PSMA, and anti-PSA antibodies.\nFill a glass syringe with 100 μL BSA solution in PBS (1%, v/v). Inject the BSA through the polyethylene tubes to prevent cell from sticking on the tubes' inner walls.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1683-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Methods of AFM-Chip for processing blood within 5 h of blood draw\n(A and B) A whole blood sample of a prostate cancer patient collected in EDTA tube and transferred to disposable syringes, respectively. Note that trapped air bubbles in the syringes should be removed.\n(C and D) Micrographs show the three antibody activated AFM-Chips along with the experimental setup for the multiplex capture of CTCs of prostate cancer from whole blood. Note that in the experimental setup, blood simultaneously passes through the devices to target the EpCAM, PSMA, and PSA markers of the CTCs.\n(E) Once captured, antigen-specific immunomarkers are used for the identification of CTCs (green dots pointed by arrows). A magnified single captured intact CTC is shown in the inset (Scale bar: 8 μm). Images in (E) reused with permission from Deliorman et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nTransfer 1 mL of whole blood from EDTA tubes into syringes of choice (we recommend disposable plastic syringes) under biosafety cabinet using a disposable needle (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].",
    "Connect polyethylene tubes to the syringe and inject the blood slowly until it reaches the other end of the tubes.\nPlace antibody activated AFM-Chips on a leveled stage (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Mount the syringes to a syringe pump (e.g., CETONI neMESYS) and connect them to the AFM-Chips using the polyethylene tubes. Connect the exit ports of the AFM-Chips to a waste container through another set of polyethylene tubes (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nAdjust the flow rate of a syringe pump to 20 μL/min and inject the blood completely into microfluidic channels.\nReplace the empty blood syringes with glass syringes filled with 100 μL of PBS. Wash channels at 20 μL/min flow rate for 5–10 min to remove the blood with any unattached cells from the channels.\nReplace the empty PBS syringes with glass syringes filled with 100 μL of anti-PSMA antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green) (1:10 by volume concentration in PBS). Pass the antibodies through channels at 20 μL/min flow rate for 5–10 min and allow incubation for 20 min in the dark to immunostain captured CTCs.\nWash the channels with 100 μL of PBS at 20 μL/min flow rate for 5–10 min to remove any excess staining antibodies.\nFor purity evaluation, repeat the steps 19–21 with 100 μL of anti-CD45 antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (red) (1:10 by volume concentration in PBS) to immunostain nonspecifically bound white blood cells (WBCs).\nPause point: Different staining antibodies can be mixed for staining the different cell types at the same time/run; however, this may cause cross-staining and thus compromise specificity.\nFollow with fluorescence imaging of stained cells as below.\nCTC capture and purity evaluation\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step will identify the captured CTCs and WBCs in the background.",
    "Investigate the CTC capture by manually counting captured CTCs with inverted fluorescence microscope in the dark using FITC filter cube and through 20× air objectives (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nInvestigate the isolation purity by counting nonspecifically bound WBCs with inverted fluorescence microscope in the dark using tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC) filter cube and through a 20× air objective.\nCalculate the purity of the device as the ratio of captured CTCs to the total number of bound cells including WBCs.\nAFM force measurements\nTiming: 4 h\nThis step will provide detailed AFM force procedures on single captured CTCs.\nPause point: Perform the AFM measurements using commercially available system (e.g., LS-AFM, AFM Workshop). Ideally, the AFM paired with an inverted fluorescence microscope and enclosed in vibration enclosure will suit best for identifying immunomarked CTCs and achieving a high degree of sound absorptions during the sensitive force measurements.\nSlowly peel off the PDMS in the AFM-Chips and transfer the glass slides with immunostained captured CTCs onto AFM stage for their nanomechanical characterization (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1683-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. AFM setup and force measurements of prostate cancer CTCs captured using AFM-Chip\n(A) Cartoon shows an AFM tip engaged with a single captured intact prostate CTC.\n(B) After peeling off the PDMS from glass slide, custom-made AFM liquid cell was used to confine the cell medium.\n(C) Micrograph shows an AFM tip positioned above the center of a stained prostate CTC for follow up force measurements (Scale bar: 30 μm).",
    "(D) Typical force curve demonstrates the interaction between the AFM tip and the CTC, where tip’s approach to and retraction from the cell surface is shown by black arrow. After initial tip-cell surface contact, the cell experiences an amount of surface deformation “D” due to the applied constant loading force. During tip retraction, the cell experiences a number of adhesion forces “F” (peaks 1–7 in the retraction process) due to its interactions with the AFM tip surface. In the process, the work of detachment “WD” (shaded gray area below the zero-force line) indicates the amount of work needed to completely detach the tip from the cell surface.\n(E) The measured adhesion values are tabulated for all peaks in (D).\n(F) After the initial tip-cell surface contact, force data (black circles) were fitted (red line) to surface indentation (dashed blue ellipse in (D)) to estimate the local Young’s modulus “E”. Images and schematics in (A–F) reused with permission from Deliorman et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nUse a custom-made PDMS gasket as the “AFM liquid cell” to hold the cell medium in the glass slides (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nNote: Cell medium choice can range from PBS to cell culture medium of choice (e.g., DMEM, RPMI) to help in maintaining the viability of the CTCs.\nMount a 6 μm-diameter colloidal tip with a nominal spring constant of 0.06 N/m on AFM liquid tip holder.",
    "Pause point: Probing CTCs with AFM in liquid could be very challenging because of cell softness. To minimize the cellular damage, cantilevers with spring constants comparable to softness of the cells are preferred in the AFM measurements, which typically range from 0.01 N/m to 2 N/m. The shape and size of the tip is another factor that needs an attention. Colloidal tips with sizes comparable to the average size of mammalian cells are preferred to minimize the interference caused by the electrostatic interactions between the cantilever and the cell surface, which could result in inconsistencies among the adhesion measurements.\nNote: Potential tip substitutions, such as high aspect ratio tips (e.g., tips with 10:1 height-to-width ratio) would also result in reliable force collection, both quality and accuracy wise, provided that there are no irregularities in the attached tips and tips are not contaminated.\nDetermine the cantilever spring constants from the power spectral density of the thermal noise fluctuations.\nDefine a clean (cell-free) area on the glass surface and approach the tip to engage with the surface. Calibrate the sensitivity of the photodiode by indenting the tip against the glass surface. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nDisengage the tip and position it above the center of a single captured intact CTC using the AFM integrated camera (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). Approach the tip to engage with the cell surface.\nPerform the force measurements either in single force mode or in force volume mode. In the latter, repeat the tip approach-retraction process over a 10 μm2 cell surface area at a resolution of 8 × 8 pixels. Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nSet the trigger force (i.e., applied constant force) to 6–12 nN, reflecting cell surface indentations of ∼0.2–0.4 μm. Set the tip approach and retraction velocities to 4 μm/s. Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15].",
    "Note: In typical AFM force measurements involving cells, it is critical to define a “proper” trigger force by which the cells will be pushed against the tip following initial tip-cell surface contact. The trigger (applied) force is experimentally determined on the cell prior to collecting force data and kept constant during subsequent AFM measurements with attention to not deform the cell above levels where tip can burst or dislocate it.\nRepeat steps 29–31 until all captured CTCs are characterized.\nAfter AFM measurements, further fix the captured CTCs and WBCs (background) using 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilize them using 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-10 for 10 min. Afterwards, immunostain the cells for DAPI (blue) and CK (red) in the dark for 30 min to verify, with inverted fluorescence microscope using DAPI and TRITC filter cubes and through a 60× air objective, that captured CTCs are DAPI+/CK+/EpCAM+ (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A) and WBCs are DAPI+/CD45+/EpCAM- (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1683-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Identification of captured CTCs and nonspecifically bound WBCs\n(A and B) Fluorescent images of (A) a captured CTC and (B) a bound WBC. Fluorescent images reveals the immunostaining of cell nuclei (blue, DAPI+ for CTC and WBC), cytoplasmic cytokeratin (red, CK+ for CTC), CD45 (red, CD45+ for WBC) and EpCAM membrane expression (green, EpCAM+ for CTC and EpCAM- for WBC). Scale bars: 20 μm. Images in (A and B) reused with permission from Deliorman et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nOptional: Measure the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear area ratio (CK+/DAPI+) of the CTCs using ImageJ.\nAFM force analysis\nTiming: 6 h\nThis step will guide with analysis of AFM force curves.",
    "Pause point: One way of analyzing AFM force curves is through extracting raw data as ASCII files using the AFM instrument software. Then, numerical computing environments, such as MATLAB, can be utilized to process the extracted raw data. For our raw AFM data, we utilized an in-house software (specifically developed for LS-AFM system of AFM Workshop) to extract the information on the elasticity, bio-adhesiveness, deformation, and work of detachment.\nExclude the force curves with unclear approaches and/or retraction curves from the analysis.\nFor the cell surface deformation measurements, measure the distance from cell contact point till trigger force is reached (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nFor the adhesion measurements, define the maximum adhesion forces from each data point in the retraction curves and assign as minima if they were less than their 5 nearest points to the right and left. Choose 10 pN as the cut-off force value due to experimental noise during measurements (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D and 5E).\nFor the work of detachment measurements, use a trapezoidal integral to calculate the area confined between the zero-force line and the retraction curve (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nFor the elasticity measurements, use the classical Hertz model of contact mechanics. Choose 100 nm fit range when applying the model (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).\nNote: According to the model, the loading force (FL) applied by the AFM tip required to indent a distance (  δ  ) into the cell surface is given by\n   F L  =  4 3   E  ( 1 −  ν 2  )    R  1 / 2    δ  3 / 2    \nwhere E is the elasticity modulus of the cell, R is the radius of the AFM tip, and   ν   is the Poisson ratio of the cell, which was set to 0.5 assuming cell’s incompressibility."
