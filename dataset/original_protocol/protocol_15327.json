    "1. The Exercise\nThe  muscle of interest for this experiment was the elbow flexors (Biceps Brachii).\nMuscle  strength was measured for each participant to be able to give each individual  an appropriate resistance. This was determined by testing each participant for  their resistance maximum (RM).\nFor  testing the RM, we used a strain gauge device interfaced with a computer  through a BioPac (DA-100C) bioelectric amplifier module (BioPac Systems,  Goleta, CA) to measure muscle strength. The module was connected to an MP-100 analog  to digital converter sampling at a frequency of 1,000 hertz per second, and at  a resolution of 24 bits (Fig. 10).\nThe  strain gauge device was fixed to a bench at a 45° angle. The subjects were  instructed to sit behind the device and rest their elbows on the padded area,  so that the exertion force is through their wrists. This was the best way to  insure that the subject will not recruit any muscle other than the biceps (Fig.  11).\nStrength  was determined on 3 occasions with each contraction being 3 seconds in duration  with approximately 45 seconds separating the contractions. The average of the 3 measurements was the RM.\nAfter  determining the RM for the biceps muscle of each participant, the intended  session of exercise was carried out with 35% of their RM.\nAll  the subjects underwent the same exercise using appropriate weighted dumbbells  to induce the muscle soreness (DOMS). This was carried out by doing 4 sets of  25 repetitions of biceps concentration curls while seated on a chair, and with  the elbows supported on their thighs (Fig. 12).",
    "Each  subject was given a 90 second resting period between each set. Subjects either  did the full set of 25 repetitions, or were instructed to stop if they failed  to steadily control the weight during the exercise.\n2. Infra-Red Camera Preparation & Setup\nThe  room where the infra-red imaging takes place was set at a constant temperature  to minimize any external bias from differences in room temperature, which could  lead to false thermal readings. For the purpose of this experiment we had a temperature  controlled room which was maintained at approximately 23°C (+/- 0.5°C).\nThe  camera was set at a distance of 1 meter away, and at a perpendicular angle to  the skin being measured (Fig. 9a)*.\nAfter  the required distance was set up, the subjects were advised to stand still  until the image has been taken. This shouldn't take more than a couple of  seconds, but it is very critical to minimize movement to insure the accuracy of  the taken image.\nIt  is preferable that the room has darker colored paint, rather than lighter  colors, to minimize any infra-red interference.\nLighting  is also critical when dealing with infra-red images, because light source that emit  infra-red waves like fluorescent or tungsten lighting could give false high  readings. The best lighting option would be a room equipped with uniform LED  lights, as LED lights hardly produce any infra-red interference (Fig. 9b)*.",
    "* A series of tests were done at our labs using the FLIR 660 IR Camera (Fig. 8), where we compared images of the skin at different angles (0 (perpendicular), 15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees), and at different distances (1, 2, and 5 meters) from the skin, to accurately detect the temperature of the skin. All images were compared to calibrated thermocouples, and the best correlation between the images and the thermocouple readings was at a perpendicular angle and at a distance of 1 meter away from the skin (r = 0.93). The different angles and distances caused a pixilation loss, and decreased the overall correlation between the images and the thermocouple readings.\n3. Image Acquirement\nFor  the purpose of this experiment, the image of the exercised muscle was taken  before the exercise, and at 24, and 48 hours post exercise.\nBody heat from sources other than the target could disrupt the thermal image and  give false readings. For this reason, no one should be standing beside or  behind the intended target.\nIn this investigation, pictures of both the exercised and non-exercised arm were taken for comparison purposes. We exercised one of the arms, as was mentioned  previously, and the other arm was used as a control (Fig. 4 and 5).\nImage numbers from the IR camera were recorded immediately on a separate spreadsheet, as it could be difficult to identify which image belongs to whom.\n4. Image Processing & Analyses\nThe  acquired IR images were processed using the \"ThermoVision ExaminIR\"  software Version: 1.10.2.\nAfter  selecting the required image for analysis, four regions of interest were  identified on the acquired image of the arm using statistical boxes on the  software interface (Fig.6).",
    "When  the required regions across the arm have been located, the software shows the  Means and Standard Deviations of the temperatures for each of the selected  regions. We can then either cross compare each region individually or obtain an average temperature of the whole arm (Fig. 7).\n5. Visual Analog Scale & Blood Analysis\nA visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess subjective soreness of the arm. The scale had a 10 cm (100mm) long line marked \"no pain\" at one end, and \"extremely sore\" at the opposite end.  Each participant was directed to make a mark along the 10 cm line to indicate their response to soreness.\nThe  VAS's were administered to the subjects before the exercise, 24 hours after the  exercise, and at 48 hours.\nPeripheral  blood was collected from the subjects to measure myoglobin concentration levels  in the blood.\nThe  blood was drawn from the subjects antecubital vein before the exercise, 30 minutes after the exercise was over, and at 48 hours.\nThe  blood was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to separate the serum from the cells. The samples were then stored at -80°C until the analyses of myoglobin  was done.\nMyoglobin was measured using a TOSOH \"AIA-360\"  Automated enzyme Immunoassay Analyzer (TOSOH Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The  myoglobin Assay kits (Myo 025297, ST AIA-PACK Myoglobin) were used according to  the manufactures instructions.\n6. Representative Results",
    "The results of IR thermal images taken during this investigation are clearly represented in figure 1. Images taken at the 3 time periods (pre-exercise, 24 hours post-exercise, and 48 hours post-exercise) for the exercised arms of the 41 subjects, showed a noticeable increase in temperature on day 2 (24 hours post-exercise) when compared to pre-exercise temperatures, and temperatures taken at 48 hours. As shown in figure 1, the average skin temperature was 32.80 +/- 1.03 °C for day 1 (pre-exercise), and 33.96 +/- 1.46 °C for day 2 (24 hours post-exercise), and 32.82 +/- 1.29 for day 3 (48 hours post-exercise). This difference in skin temperature from day 1 to day 2 was significant (ANOVA p < 0.01).\nHowever, for the un-exercised arm, changes amongst the 3 time periods were not evident. Figure 1 shows that the average skin temperature was 33.08 +/- 0.83 °C for day 1 (pre-exercise), and 32.79 +/- 1.42 °C for day 2 (24 hours post-exercise), and 33.17 +/- 0.95 for day 3 (48 hours post-exercise). This difference in skin temperature over the 3 days was not significant (ANOVA p = 0.38).\nThe results of the pain readings from the VAS are shown in figure 2. As seen in figure 2, the reported pain had a dramatic increase on days 2 and 3. Pain levels of the exercised muscle increased from 3.6 +/- 6.1 on day 1, to 36.3 +/- 22.8 on day 2, and 37.5 +/- 25.3 on day 3. This increase from day 1 was significant (ANOVA p < 0.01).",
    "The results of the myoglobin concentration levels are shown in figure 3. As seen in this figure, there was hardly any change between the 2 myoglobin concentrations on day 1 (pre, & 30 minutes post exercise). But on day 3, the increase in myoglobin was very large. This increase on day 3 was approximately 147 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood when compared to the first 2 concentrations on day 1. Myoglobin concentrations were 30.12 +/- 7.66 ng/mL at baseline, 31.66 +/- 11.89 ng/mL 30 minutes post exercise, and 178.96 +/- 249.51 ng/mL on day 3. This increase on day 3 was highly significant (ANOVA p < 0.01).\nA correlation analysis was done between the skin temperatures obtained from the IR images, and the VAS soreness levels. It was found that there was a considerable correlation between the VAS readings on day 2, and the skin temperature measurement on day 2. This correlation was significant (r = 0.312, p < 0.05). However, there was no evident correlation between the VAS readings and the skin temperatures on day 3. This correlation was insignificant (r = 0.047, p = 0.77).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3551/3551fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
