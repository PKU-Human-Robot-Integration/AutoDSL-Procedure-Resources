Imported data will be publicly available on the server\n      to other ImmCellFie users with access to your username. Please ensure that\n      no Protected Health Information (PHI) or business sensitive data are\n      imported. Also take care with uploading unpublished data. For private or\n      sensitive data we recommend locally installing and running CellFie.\n    \nPreparing ImmCellFie input files\nTiming: 5–10 min\n      ImmCellFie requires a specific format for input data. Expression data must\n      meet the following format requirements: i) entrez gene IDs in the first\n      column, ii) wide format (each subsequent column contains the expression\n      data for individual samples), iii) uploaded as csv, and iv) optional\n      header in the first row with sample names. Users also have the option to\n      include a properties file containing phenotypic information to group\n      samples. This file must: i) include a header with property names (e.g.,\n      sex, cell type, treatment, etc.), ii) match row order to the sample order\n      (columns) in the expression data, iii) uploaded as csv. Input data needs\n      to be pre-processed to meet these formatting requirements. The following\n      steps outline how the HPA blood expression data was pre-processed in R.\n    \n        Download the expression data from HPA as a zip folder and save into a\n        directory of your choice.\n      \nOpen RStudio.\nLoad the required library packages.\n> library(data.table)\n> library(dplyr)\n> library(tidyr)\n> library(AnnotationDbi)\n> library(org.Hs.eg.db)\nLoad HPA data.\n> blood.data <- fread(paste('unzip -p',\n          'Blood_Atlas_Data/rna_blood_cell_sample.tsv.zip'))\nNote: We have created a folder called",
    "‘Blood_Atlas_Data’ as our directory of choice in this example. Ensure that\n      your RStudio working directory is set to the same location that houses\n      this Blood_Atlas_Data folder.\n    \n        Generate expression matrix compatible with CellFie.\n        \n            Isolate expression data and reshape the data such that rows are\n            samples and columns are genes.\n            \n> TPM.matrix <- blood.data[, c(\"ENSG ID\",\n                  \"Sample ID\", \"TPM\")] %>% spread(‘Sample\n                  ID’, TPM)\n            Convert Ensembl gene IDs to entrez IDs.\n            \n> gene.map <- AnnotationDbi::select(org.Hs.eg.db,\n                  keys=TPM.matrix$`ENSG ID’, columns=c(\"ENTREZID\"),\n                  keytype=\"ENSEMBL\") %>% na.omit()\n> TPM.matrix.entrez <- left_join(gene.map, TPM.matrix,\n                  by=c(\"ENSEMBL\"=\"ENSG ID\")) %>%\n                  dplyr::select(-ENSEMBL)\n            Aggregate duplicate genes by max value.\n            \n> TPM.entrez.max <- aggregate(TPM.matrix.entrez,\n                  by=list((TPM.matrix.entrez[,1])),max) %>%\n                  dplyr::select(-Group.1)\n            Add pseudo count.\n            \n> TPM.entrez.pseudo <-\n                  cbind(ENTREZID=TPM.entrez.max$ENTREZID, TPM.entrez.max[,\n                  2:ncol(TPM.entrez.max)] + 0.00001)\n        Generate properties data matrix (phenotypic information for the\n        samples).\n      \n> pheno.data <- dplyr::select(blood.data, c(\"Sample\n          ID\", \"Donor\", \"Immune cell\")) %>%\n          distinct()\nExport files.\n> fwrite(TPM.entrez.pseudo, \"demo_expression.csv\")\n> fwrite(pheno.data, \"demo_pheno.csv\")\nNote: We have provided an R Markdown (RMD)\n      file with the complete code to preprocess these files (File S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2452-Mmc1.zip]). The end result of these steps is the generation of two CSV files:\n      demo_expression.csv and demo_pheno.csv. Users are free to use any platform\n      to process files to obtain CSV files. If users wish to avoid using R in\n      this tutorial, they can skip this step and use the provided processed\n      files (Files S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2452-Mmc2.csv]\n      and\n      S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2452-Mmc3.csv]) to follow along with the rest of the tutorial.\n    \nAlternatives: CSV files can also\n      be generated using spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel, to make\n      tables that match the layouts of demo_expression.csv and demo_pheno.csv,\n      and save the spreadsheets in CSV format.\n    \nImport data to ImmCellFie\nTiming: seconds\n      ImmCellFie allows users to import data in two ways: i) locally from a\n      personal computer and ii) remotely from\n      ImmuneSpace.org[href=http://ImmuneSpace.org]. Here we will be\n      importing the expression data and properties document saved locally from\n      the previous step. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1].",
    "Click ‘Select data’ below your newly entered user name, or click on the\n        ‘Data’ tab on the ImmCellFie Dashboard. Click on ‘Upload local files’. A\n        pop-up will appear with detailed formatting instructions.\n      \n        Upload the csv files generated from the previous steps:\n        demo_expression.csv and demo_pheno.csv.\n      \n        Annotate the data set as “ImmCellFie Demo” in the ‘Description\n        (optional)’ box.\n      \n        Click ‘Upload’ to submit the data set. A pop up will appear indicating\n        that the data has been successfully uploaded to your account.\n      \nAlternatives: Users have the\n      option to import data remotely from the ImmuneSpace database:\n      https://www.immunespace.org/[href=https://www.immunespace.org/].\n      While a complete tutorial of the ImmuneSpace database is beyond the scope\n      of this protocol, navigating their website is quite self-explanatory. To\n      import data groups from your ImmuneSpace account, simply click on\n      ‘ImmuneSpace’ rather than ‘Upload local files’ from the ImmCellFie Data\n      page and follow the detailed instructions (hover over the question marks)\n      to connect your custom ImmuneSpace group with ImmCellFie. For this you\n      will need to obtain an API Key from ImmuneSpace and identify Group Labels\n      for the data you wish to use.\n    \nRun CellFie algorithm\nTiming: 9 min (can be longer for larger\n      datasets)\n    \n      The CellFie algorithm presents a powerful approach to predict the activity\n      of many metabolic functions from transcriptomic and proteomic data. This\n      framework facilitates phenotypic interpretation from these complex omic\n      data types by comprehensively quantifying the propensity of a cell line or\n      tissue to express the molecular components underlying a set of metabolic\n      functions. Metabolic task scores can be computed based on any type of\n      transcriptomic (e.g., microarray or RNA-Seq, bulk or single cell) or\n      proteomic dataset for CHO, human, rat, or mouse. Additionally, users can\n      select various types of gene-expression thresholding methods.\n      Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3].\n    \n        The previous step merely uploaded data to your ImmCellFie account.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the\n            Data page from the ImmCellFie Dashboard and click the ‘Load’ button\n            to the right of the ImmCellFie Demo dataset.\n          \nNote: The dashboard should now read\n      ‘ImmCellFie Demo’ under ‘Input’.\n    \n        Click ‘Analyze’ from the ImmCellFie Dashboard, and select ‘CellFie’ from\n        the drop-down menu. Alternatively, users may click on ‘Analyze’,\n        followed by ‘CellFie’ (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\n      \n        The left side of the page contains the necessary parameters for running\n        a CellFie analysis. Select ‘human’ from the ‘Organism’ drop-down menu.\n        \n            This will automatically select the correct human model ‘recon v2.2’.\n          \n        CellFie provides two thresholding strategies to determine the set of\n        “active” genes in the input dataset. The global approach is mainly\n        applied when only one sample is available; therefore we will be using\n        the gene-specific local gene thresholding approach in this example.\n        Select ‘local’ from the ‘Threshold type’ drop-down menu and keep the\n        default local thresholding parameters. See\n        defining gene thresholds[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4] section for detailed\n        descriptions of the thresholding approaches.\n        \nPercentile or value: percentile.\nLocal threshold type: min-max mean.\nLow percentile: 25.\nHigh percentile: 75.\n        Add the optional description “demo-results” in the ‘Description’ box.\n        Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].",
    "Click ‘Run CellFie’. A pop-up window will appear with an estimate of how\n        long the run will take. After exiting the pop-up, the ImmCellFie\n        dashboard will continue to display a tiny spinning wheel on the far\n        right to indicate that the run is computing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\n      \n        When the run is complete, click ‘Load’ from the popup window to load the\n        CellFie results. Alternatively, users can load results by navigating to\n        the Data page from the ImmCellFie Dashboard and use the load button to\n        the right of the CellFie run. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7].\n      \nNote: The dashboard should now read\n      ‘demo-results’ under ‘Result’.\n    \nDownload CellFie results\nTiming: seconds\n      Users can download the raw output of a CellFie run. These results can be\n      further analyzed by the user using their platform of choice. The raw\n      output of CellFie includes 4 files (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Briefly,\n      the main output of CellFie is a matrix of metabolic task scores (MTSs).\n      The MTS output of CellFie provides a quantification of each metabolic\n      function within the samples. Due to the nature of how MTSs are calculated,\n      scores should not be compared across tasks (within a sample) but only\n      across samples. To facilitate intra-sample comparison of tasks, CellFie\n      also calculates MTSs in a binary form, which simply applies a\n      task-specific threshold to determine whether the task is active or not.\n      This binary form of MTSs provides a “pass” vs “fail” report of metabolic\n      activity.\n    \ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2452_1.csv\n        Use the ‘Downloads’ button\n        imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2452-Fx4.jpg\n        at the top of the CellFie Results track to batch-download all the\n        results.\n      \nNote: The score matrices do not contain\n      row or column headers. Row labels for the score matrices (score.csv and\n      scoreBinary.csv) are provided in a separate matrix file (taskInfo.csv),\n      and the column order of the score matrices correspond to the order of",
    "samples provided in the input expression file. Appending row labels and\n      headers can be easily done in any spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft\n      Excel, Google Sheets, etc.).\n    \n      Use properties data to generate subgroups based on cell type\n    \nTiming: seconds to minutes\n    \n      Users can generate subgroups based on information (columns) provided in\n      the properties document.

The ImmCellFie Hierarchy tool however provides\n        hierarchical visualizations in the form of a treemap, enclosure diagram,\n        or Voronoi map. Click on the ‘Hierarchy’ tab in the CellFie Results.\n      \n        Use the drop-down menus under ‘Select Subgroups to Compare’ to select\n        two different immune cell types. In this example we will look at\n        differences between two types of memory T cells: memory CD4 T-cells vs.\n        memory CD8 T-cells.\n      \n        Toggle between the three types of hierarchical visualizations: treemap,\n        enclosure diagram, and Voronoi treemap. Finish by selecting the\n        enclosure diagram tool.\n      \n        The Hierarchy tool provides many of the same parameters: ‘Depth’,\n        ‘Subgroup’, ‘Color map’. Two additional parameters are available for\n        users to customize the plot:\n        \n            Value: allows the user to display results in either the continuous\n            (‘score’) or binary (‘activity’) form.\n          \n            Label opacity: users can modify the label opacity using the sliding\n            bar at the bottom left of the plot.\n          \n        Set parameters:\n        \nDepth: 3 (task).\nSubgroup: memory CD4 T-cell vs. memory CD8 T-cell.\nValue: activity.\nColor map: blue-orange.\nLabel opacity: 0.75.\n        Hover your mouse over a plot element to view a pop-out window with\n        summary statistics of the element.\n      \n        Display multiple summary statistics.\n        \n            Select the task, system, and/or subsystem elements of interest.
