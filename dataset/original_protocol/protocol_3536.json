    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSensory testing\nTiming: 2 h\nWe recommend using a cotton swab, dynamic brush, and/or a 0.6 g VFH or lower to measure innocuous mechanical touch and the metal needles or 4 g VFH or higher to measure noxious mechanical pain. These instructions assume that the researcher is using a photron camera and the accompanying software, some specifics will vary depending on the setup. Consult the makers of the camera/software used for more info.\nNote: For each mouse group, this will take 30 min for experimental day habituation of all mice on the restrainer and then 5 min for each mouse sensory testing with a single stimulus.\nSet up the testing environment by placing testing platform on the table, with paper towels or diaper pad underneath.\nPlace testing chambers on the platform so the long side of the chamber can be seen perpendicularly by the camera. Additional chambers should be placed side by side (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nSet up camera on stand in front of the table so its lens is level and parallel with the side of the testing chamber (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/458-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. High-speed videography behavioral setup with camera set level with the platform and perpendicular to the chamber\n(A) Single mouse set up, (B) multiple mouse setup focused on center mouse, and (C) camera setup with infrared light on top.\nCamera setup.\nTurn on the camera, remove the lens cap, ensuring that the power cable is plugged in and its ethernet cable is plugged into the laptop.",
    "Open photron fastcam software (obtainable free from their website) on the laptop and ensure that the camera is functional. Note, this software is simply a useful tool available with our high-speed camera, but other software may be used. The software used should simply have the ability to play the recorded videos and perform accurate measurements of paw height and velocity.\nSet camera to record at 500–1,000 fps with the spatial resolution and framing sufficient to resolve the full body of the mouse.\nWe recommend setting the camera to “stop recording” when a trigger is pressed since the movement is short and camera memory generally only allows for a few seconds of recording. The behaviors are complete within 1,000 ms, and a second researcher or a single researcher with a trigger can assist in this.\n(optional) Depending on lighting and camera, it may be necessary to utilize infrared lights to ensure a clear image so that the movement of the paw and the eye are clearly visible. Placement of these lights must ensure that reflection of light on the plastic restrainer does not obstruct the image. Though some trial and error might be necessary to get an optimal image, placement of the light above the camera has previously been effective (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPlace mice in their chambers disturbing them as little as possible, making certain that all limbs and tail are contained within the chamber before placing the weight on the top.\nLine the chambers with their long sides perpendicular to the camera and place a piece of paper towel or other obstruction between each to prevent visual cues from neighboring mice.\nAllow 15–30 min to pass for experimental day habituation. It is imperative that mice are completely still but awake before applying stimuli to the paw.",
    "Apply stimulus to hind paw while recording.\nMove camera to ensure entire side of mouse is within frame and the eye and paw are within focus.\nEnsure that tail is not on the side being recorded as it will make proper analysis impossible with an obstructed view of the paw. Mice will turn every so often, so if one mouse is not in the proper position, the experimenter can move onto a different mouse until the previous has moved appropriately.\nHold stimulus below the mesh and apply to hind paw plantar surface, as described in Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]. We direct the readers to the sample videos in the training data to get an idea of how sensory stimuli are delivered, as well as typical mouse responses.\nIn the past, we measured “time to response” but found with a factor analysis that it did not provide any additional information to distinguish between noxious and innocuous stimuli so we have concluded that it is not important to see the exact moment the stimulus touches the paw. However, it is essential to confirm the stimulus came in contact with the paw and not a different part of the body such as the belly.\nTrigger the camera to stop recording after stimulation and behavior is complete. Generally, the full behavior is complete within 1000 ms, but we ensure 2–3 s of recording from the point of stimulation to capture the full behavior.\nConfirm all behavioral features can be resolved in the recorded video.\nEnsure that reaction occurred and was fully recorded, from the stimulus application to the timepoint where the mouse returns its paw to the mesh.",
    "Ensure that the stimulus made the desired contact with the paw, while not being obstructed by the mesh or touching other body parts. It is common that experimenters accidentally touch other parts of the body or parts of the mesh so confirming contact was made is essential.\nEnsure that the paw and eye are unobstructed so that all behavioral features can be measured.\nIf the video is not viable for recording, wait 5 min before repeating application of the stimulus.\nRepeat step 5 for another stimulus or move the camera to a new mouse and repeat step 5, waiting at least 10–15 min between testing the same mouse. We recommend performing stimulus application to at least an innocuous stimulus and a noxious stimulus.\nCritical: There are instances where a stimulus makes contact with the hind paw, but the mouse does not react. In these instances, the recording obviously cannot be used, but it is best to keep track of reactions and non-reactions to report response rate.\nCritical: Previous experiments have found that for the most consistent results, it is best for some more intense stimuli to only apply one stimulus a day, waiting about 24 h after each stimulus before applying the next. Applying one stimulus per day to a given mouse also avoids potential sensitization, which could cause altered responses with repetitive stimulation, making it difficult for trial-by-trial comparisons.\nCritical: Whether the stimuli are applied on the same day or on separate days, it is recommended that stimuli are applied in order from least intense to most intense to avoid sensitization.\nPause Point: A pause can be taken after each day of experiments, though if a mouse is not habituated or tested for over 2 weeks, it may be necessary to repeat habituation again.\nScoring behavioral features",
    "Timing: 10–20 min\nWe used Photron fastcam viewer (open-source, but only available for windows. Other software such as ImageJ can also be used) to score each video for three variables: paw height, paw velocity, and pain behavior score. After setting a scale based on a known length in the video, a researcher can score these variables. To limit variability in scoring, we suggest the same scorer is used for all videos in an experiment, especially if the researchers scoring videos are inexperienced in scoring this type of data.\nCalibrating Length and Frame Rate. To score paw height and velocity accurately, the video’s frame rate and a scale must be set within the software. For most recording software, each video recording will be a series of frames without an inherent frame rate or scale assigned to the file. In Photron fastcam, it will ask for the frame rate when opening the video. By entering the frame rate used for recording, the time will be set appropriately for measuring velocity. For measuring length accurately, it is important to set a scale to a known distance within the video. In Photron fastcam, this can be done by clicking “Dimensions” > “Calibration” and then choosing the “Manual” radio button. Choose “calibrate by length between two points” and enter the length. Finally, move the red “measurement line” in the video to the known distance and click “apply.” The grid or the sides of the chamber can be good targets for this.\nNote: The grid view of the cursor in Photron fastcam can obscure measurement. To remove it, go to “Menu” > “Configuration” > “Preference” > “Zoom Ratio” > 100%.",
    "Note: When calibrating the length, recognize that although the video recorded has depth, the video itself is two-dimensional. We suggest having a clear object that is aligned to either the y or x axis for more accurate calibration. The PFV manual that is included with the download has more detailed instructions on software use. The manual can be downloaded here: https://photron.com/software-downloads/[href=https://photron.com/software-downloads/]\nMeasuring paw height. After calibrating the video length, the paw height (mm) can be measured. Paw height should be measured as the distance from the apex of the first upward movement to the point directly below it on the mesh (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B). This can be done in Photron fastcam by clicking “Dimensions” > “Measurements” and choosing “Two points.” Play through the entire movement of the paw to identify the point at which the paw is at its apex during its first upward movement. Choose an easily identifiable region of the paw (i.e., middle of plantar surface, the point where a digit intersects with the paw, heel, etc.) and click it to set that as the initial point. Rewind the video to identify where that region was prior to stimulation and choose the second point at that location along the y axis. Importantly, ensure the line measurement is parallel to the y axis and not at an angle. The height will appear on the top left of the screen.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/458-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. How to score height and velocity measurements",
    "Height is taken by recording the location of the paw on the mesh before stimulus (A) and the location of the paw at its apex (B). The difference in distance in the Y direction is then taken to get the height (B). Velocity is measured by picking a point shortly after the paw rises from the mesh (C) and a point shortly before it reaches its apex (D) and measuring the distance between those two points (D) and dividing by the difference in time.\nCritical: It is important to play through the entire paw movement to identify the apex of the first upward movement. In some behaviors, especially painful ones, a paw shake may lead a mouse to raise its paw initially, move it back down, and then raise it even higher. In this scenario, the apex of the first upward movement should be used to measure the paw height. Do not use the second upward movement as that is a measurement of the paw shake instead.",
    "Measuring paw velocity. After calibrating the video length and frame rate, the paw velocity (m/s) can be measured. This can be done in Photron fastcam by clicking “Dimensions” > “Measurements” and choosing “Two points.” Play through the entire movement of the paw to identify the frames in which the paw is experiencing its first upward movement. Paw velocity is measured by taking two points at different frames during this movement (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D). Similar to a pendulum swinging, the paw’s upward movement will begin slowly, speed up, and then decrease its velocity near the middle of this movement. To measure the velocity of the movement, it is important to choose frames during the middle of the movement. We recommend choosing the starting frame as 1–2 frames after the paw has completely lifted off the mesh and the last frame a few frames later (5–10 depending on the movement) to capture the paw velocity. Select an easily identifiable region of the paw (i.e., middle of plantar surface, the point where a digit intersects with the paw, heel, etc.) in the starting and ending frame. For velocity measurements, the measurement line will likely be at an angle (unlike the height measurement). If using Photron fastcam, the height will appear on the top left of the screen. The velocity can also be calculated manually by simply dividing the distance by the number of frames or time between the start and end frames.\nCritical: It is recommended not to use the toe for velocity measurements since in some movements (primarily noxious), the toe can act as a cantilever and may feature much higher velocities than the center region of the plantar surface that are not accurate estimations of the paw’s velocity.",
    "Critical: Velocity will show the most variability in scoring with even the same scorer having the potential to come up with slightly different numbers when they rescore data. If properly done though with consistent standards for measurement, this variability should not exceed +/- 0.05 m/s.\nMeasuring pain score. The pain score is a combination of the presence of four behaviors that typically only occur with noxious-stimuli (orbital tightening, jumping, paw shaking, paw guarding). If three of the four behaviors occur within a video, the behavior will be scored as a 3.\nNote: We define the presence of jumping if all paws leave the mesh and at least three paws are lifted off the mesh surface at the same time.\nNote: We define the presence of shaking when the stimulated hind paw’s movement includes at least one up-down-up movement (i.e., the hind paw is lifted up, moves downward, and lifts back up again). Although paw shaking generally includes the paw moving up and down several times, just one shake is sufficient to be scored as occurring.\nNote: We define the presence of orbital tightening when the eyelid either slightly or extremely narrows during the movement. This is a component of the Mouse Grimace Scale and for our pain score, we would count either a level 1 or level 2 orbital tightening. We direct readers to the sample videos in the training data set for examples of orbital tightening. Those scoring videos must be careful that they do not mistake the apparent narrowing of a mouse’s eye due to the angled turning of its head for grimacing. The return to the eyes original level of openness normally indicates it is a true grimace.",
    "Note: We define presence of paw guarding when the paw does not immediately return to the mesh surface following stimulation or returns abnormally to the surface such as on its toes or other twisted paw configurations.\nStatistical mapping onto the mouse pain scale with CD1/C57 response library\nTo perform dimension reduction of these data (i.e., combining paw height, velocity, and pain score into a single number for comparison between videos), a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used. In our original paper (Abdus-Saboor et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), we used the eigenvalues of the first principle component from this PCA that was developed from a CD1/C57 male and female response library. The averages, standard deviations, and eigenvalue weights were therefore developed across both these genotypes and sexes. Since we saw limited variability between each genotype and sex, we can use and recommend using these aggregated averages, standard deviations, and eigenvalue weights (Table 1). However, it is also appropriate to use the variables from a specific strain and sex.\nThese variables represent the range of measurements (from both noxious and innocuous stimuli) to be expected in these genotypes/sexes. For this calculation, each measurement is first converted into a z score with a “z score transformation” using the average and standard deviation of that behavioral feature. The aggregated z scores of all three parameters are then combined using a weighted eigenvalue projection.\nAs an example, if a particular video had a velocity of 1,427.51 mm/s, height of 11.14 mm, and pain score of 2, these would first be transformed into the following z score equation and subsequently weighted with an eigenvalue projection with the CD1/C57 M/F response library:\nZ score Transformation\nVelocity: (1,427.51 mm/s - 1,106.372 mm/s) / 645.624 = 0.49741\nHeight: (11.14 mm − 11.167 mm) / 6.552 = −0.00412",
    "Pain Score: (2 − 1.04)/1.15 = 0.83478\nWeighted Eigenvalue Projection\n(0.49741 × 0.582674) + (−0.00412 × 0.580398) + (0.83478 × 0.568885) = 0.76233\nThus, this example video would be given a “0.76233” on the Mouse Pain Scale (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_458_2.csv\nCreation of in-house response library\nIf using a different genotype/sex combination or if considered that responses to stimuli may be different in a new researcher’s hands under new experimental conditions, it may be important to generate a new “in-house response library.” However, since we saw little variability between our genotypes/sexes, this may not be necessary. We thus recommend using our response library values.\nHowever, to generate response library values, a researcher should record videos for each genotype and sex being used in their studies in response to static touch, dynamic touch, light pinprick, and heavy pinprick as to capture the full range of possible behavioral features. We recommend capturing videos of 10 different mice per stimulus per group (genotype and sex). Thus, if using all four stimuli for males of genotype X, 40 videos would be recorded to generate the response library. If using both male and female, 80 videos would be recorded.\nTo generate the variables for z score transformation, simply calculate the average and standard deviation of each behavioral feature (velocity, height, pain score) for each group (i.e., male of genotype X) across ALL stimuli (static touch, cotton swab, light pinprick, heavy pinprick). If the researcher finds no difference between males and females or cross-genotype, we recommend finding an overall average and standard deviation across all groups to capture the full range of possible behavioral feature measurements.",
    "Next, the researcher will need to perform a principle component analysis (PCA) with SAS or other software to obtain the first principle component. This will produce a weighted eigenvalue for each measurement that can then be used to transform your three-dimensional z scores into a single number. It is recommended that the researcher only use the first principle component as we found it accounts reliably for most of the variance within this system and it projects in an easily-interpretable single dimension. To see how we performed this PCA with our initial videos, please see (Abdus-Saboor et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])."
