    "Agrobacterium mediated transient transformation of tobacco leavesCulture Agrobacterium strain C58C1 carrying the target gene of interest in a 5 ml culture medium of Lurie broth overnight at 30 °C in an incubation shaker and spin down at 1,000 x g. Transfer the bacterial cells into 5 ml of induction medium (see Recipes) and grow at 30 °C for 16 h with shaking.Spin the cells down and re-suspended in 1 ml infiltration medium (see Recipes). Measure the bacterial concentration to an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm in a fresh 5 ml tube of infiltration medium. Infiltrate young leaves of about 4 weeks old tobacco plants, Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi using a needleless syringe. Visualize plant expression after 48 h.Note: Protocol modified from Van den Ackerveken et al. (1996).Preparation of Arabidopsis plant samplesGFP or YFP when viewed through the oculars with a broad emission filter coupled with a 488 nm LED will not only allow visualization of GFP or YFP (with less excitation efficiency) but also the plastids. This full spectrum visualization allows the user to differentiate damaged areas where plastids shift from red emission to orange. Furthermore in variegated tissues, ocular observation may be the only method of differentiating low GFP or YFP and damaged/stressed areas. Ocular observations have the benefit of much deeper optical sections, providing context for localization. In this case, 10x and 20x visualization provided clues to pursue vascular localization.RFP excited with 543 nm light visualized with a broad emission filter will appear a deep orange color in a ruby red background from the plastids. With low RFP expression, it’s difficult to differentiate the two, and the CSLM should be used to separate the two.",
    "The benefit of using LED over more common mercury vapor lamps is the reduction in photobleaching or degradation of the plastid pigments, which will shift emission causing erroneous analyses.Leaf/flowerThe surface tension of the water used for wet mounting under a larger cover slip will hold samples steady during imaging. The addition of a trace of Tween 20 (5-10 µl in 250 ml water) will assist in the wetting of flowers, which are far more hydrophobic than leaves. StemsA double-edged razor blade snapped in half longitudinally before unwrapping is used to make cross sections of stems. Snapping double-edged razor blades is hazardous (Figure 1). The stem sections should be taken in the middle of the internodes to avoid leaf vascular traces found near the nodes (Figure 2). The sections should be thin enough and consistent enough to fit under a coverslip (< 0.3 mm) while in water. Cut the stem in a forward and downward motion exposing the tissue to clean blade areas preventing further damage (Figure 3). The blade will dull within roughly 30 cross sections and should be rotated or disposed of. Dull blades will compress the stems and pull the helical thickenings of the secondary cell wall out of the metaxylem. Note: The cut and damaged cells and those intact but in contact with the water under the coverslip will begin to degrade immediately. It is necessary to image deeper into the tissue than these cells with CSLM. Familiarity with the phenomenon of emission spectra shifting from far red plastid autofluorescence to green is best characterized with wild type plant material. The degradation of chlorophylls from damage causes the spectra to move from far red to green, this may result in autofluorescence being mistaken for GFP. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301105245_3536.jpgFigure 1.

    "Grasp the blade so that the sharp edges are not pressured by the fingers. B. The index fingers are retracted while slow and constant pressure is used to bend the blade in half. C. As the two outer edges come closer, the index fingers and thumbs are placed near the folded side and pressure there will cause the blade to snap into two separate blades. D. Unwrapping the blade is done carefully again to prevent cuts through the paper. Each half of the blade may be used for dissection.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301105404_1233.jpgFigure 2.

Method for cutting and mounting Arabidopsis stem cross sections. A. The stem with the unneeded portions removed is laid flat on the slide with water. B. Sections are cut as thin as possible in a forward and downward motion. The blade may be rotated to expose a sharp edge, or the other half may be used. C. While cutting, the sections may stack, this is remedied by gentle manipulation with a dissecting needle or probe or insect pin. D. Once all sections are separated, a cover slip is placed on the samples. Uniform sections are important for level cover slip placement. Water may be added or wicked off to keep the sections in water, but without movement.  Preparation of enzymatically digested plant tissues and visualizationPartial enzymatic digestion of A. thaliana leaves for visualization of fluorescence in plant vasculature. Enzymatic digestion is done by modifying the protocol of Yoo et al. (2007) used for Protoplast Isolation Procedure. Cut the leaves so most of the lamina is trimmed off from the midrib and veins and subjected to enzyme digestion. Note: A six to seven weeks old plant is normally used for this experiment.",
    "Place the plant material to be digested in a Petri dish containing the enzyme solution and put it in a vacuum desiccator and vacuum infiltrate for 15 min.Note: A 5-10 ml cellulase/macerozyme solution (see Recipes) is enough for a flowering A. thaliana plant.Take out the Petri dish from vacuum and continue digestion at RT for 2 h with gentle shaking on a platform shaker, between 30-50 RPM. The proper digestion time is near when the epidermis is digested away, and mesophyll cells begin sloughing away. The slurry generated to visualize vascular parenchyma with intact leaf or is easily transferred with a transfer pipette or fine tip forceps as the samples are not allowed to fully digest to the protoplast stage. The sample can be transferred to a Petri dish containing 10 ml of the WI buffer. On a compound microscope, if the vasculature can be seen, the sample is ready for confocal analysis. Vasculature is easily identified by the helical thickenings in the xylem with transmitted light at 10x or 20x. Digestion time will vary with the hardiness of the plant material. Mount samples on slides with coverslips for confocal microscopy. The incubation solution is used to mount the sample, as it will support the cells during imaging.GFP or YFP can be visualized with RFP with relative ease with the correct filter sets on the CSLM, although not simultaneously. Sequential or simultaneous acquisitions is dictated by the fluorescent protein used and the relative strength compared to various sources of autofluorescence. It is crucial to compare CSLM settings to the wild type material at the same settings used to detect the fluorescent proteins. When expression of the fluorescent protein(s) is low, it is suggested to check and recheck against negative controls.",
    "Plastid suborganellar localization often requires practices outside of routine confocal imaging. Operators should be aware of data clipping from under and overexposure of the detectors. Underexposed pixels may imply lost data. Overexposed pixels are data lost, and there is concern regarding overloading of the detectors. NIS-Elements has an indicator display for under and overexposed pixels. When expression levels are low or near the same signal levels as autofluorescence, it is suggested that the look up table (LUT) be manipulated to increase the brightness on the display screen after image acquisition. Images acquired in the same way between the negative and putative positives should be viewed with these same artificial increases in signal. Increasing the signal to the detectors will only increase the artifacts and noise in the images. Chlorophyll autofluorescence, detected in the 650-720 nm range at 60x or higher will overlap autofluorescence in other detection channels. Signal not colocalized with the chlorophyll autofluorescence may indicate positive fluorophore signal. It is crucial to repeat the experiment and continue to compare the images between the negative and putative positives.Nikon A1 CSLM notes:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301105915_1119.jpg"
