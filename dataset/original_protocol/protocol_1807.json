    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBlue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)\nTiming: between 2.5–3 h (day 1)\nThis step allows for the separation of mitochondrial supercomplexes based on their molecular weight (Acín-Pérez et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Using a molecular weight standard and Coomassie staining, the bands containing mitochondrial supercomplexes can be visualized and the protein composition of the different supercomplexes can be inferred (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1398-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. BN-PAGE schematic workflow\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com]\nThis step is adapted from the protocol described in Jha et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nPrepare the samples using 75 μg of mitochondrial protein as starting material.\nAdd 6 μL of digitonin stock to the mitochondrial pellet (for a final concentration of 1.5% digitonin).\nAdd 5 μL of NativePAGE™ 4x Sample Buffer.\nAdd 9 μL of MQ-H2O to make a final volume of 20 μL.\nCritical: The digitonin concentration should be adjusted depending on the protein concentration, such that the digitonin/protein ratio is kept between 4-8 g/g to allow for efficient solubilization of membrane proteins. In this protocol, we use 6 μL of a 5% digitonin stock, which corresponds to a digitonin/protein ratio of 4 g/g. For tissues with high mitochondrial content (e.g. heart), 8 g/g digitonin has been reported to give a better band separation and resolution than 4 g/g digitonin (Jha et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). For other applications, it is recommended to run a titration prior to experimentation.\nSolubilize the pellet by gentle mixing with a 20p pipette.\nNote: Avoid the formation of bubbles while mixing.\nIncubate the solubilized mitochondria on ice for 20 min.\nCentrifuge (20,000g, 10 min, 4°C)\nCollect 15 μL of the supernatant and transfer it into new tubes.\nAdd 1.5 μL of NativePAGE™ 5% G-250 Sample Additive sample additive to the collected supernatant.",
    "Note: The Coomassie G-250 sample additive should be such that the final G-250 concentration is ¼ the digitonin concentration. In this case, if 6 μL of 5% digitonin were used, the volume of NativePAGE™ 5% G-250 Sample Additive should be 1.5 μL.\nSet up the electrophoresis system (XCell SureLock Mini-Cell) and place the NativePage 3–12% gradient gel inside the cell (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1398-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Electrophoresis system setup and sample loading\nFor a technical demonstration of the protocol, 75 μg of isolated mitochondria from three animals were loaded in different wells from a BN-PAGE gel. The fourth well was loaded with 10 μL of NativePAGE™ 5% G-250 Sample Additive as a loading control.\nNote: Be sure to remove the white tape on the bottom of the gel and the comb from the wells.\nWash the wells of the gel by gently pipetting 1 mL of dark blue cathode buffer into the wells.\nAdd 20 mL of dark blue cathode buffer in the inner chamber of the electrophoresis system and check for leakage.\nLoad 15 μL of the sample into the gel wells using gel-loading tips (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: To our knowledge, only unstained protein standards are available for high molecular weights such as the NativeMark™ Unstained Protein Standard. In order to visualize this protein standard, a process of staining the gel in a different Coomassie than the one used in this protocol is required (e.g. G-250 Coomassie is used for the gel whereas R-250 is used for this standard). This staining process, in which the gel is incubated in acetic acid and other chemicals. Thus, if a molecular weight standard is required, we recommend running two gels, one for staining and one for in-gel digestion.\nNote: Avoid the formation of bubbles while loading the sample into the wells.",
    "Fill the inner chamber with 180 mL of dark blue cathode buffer and the outside chamber with 600 mL of anode buffer.\nNote: While filling the electrophoresis system chambers, be sure to use cold buffers and not to disturb the samples in the wells.\nPlace the electrophoresis system inside an ice-containing bucket and, if possible, place it inside a cold chamber at 4°C (please see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] for more details).\nPlug the electrophoresis system to a PowerPac™ Basic Power Supply and turn it on. Run the gel at 150 V for 30 min (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1398-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Running the BN-PAGE\nAfter 30 min, carefully remove the dark blue buffer and fill the inner chamber with 200 mL of light blue cathode buffer.\nRun the gel at 250 V for 60 min. If better separation of the bands is desired, then the gel can be run for a maximum of 150 min at 250 V.\nNote: Running times longer than 150 min will not substantially improve the separation and resolution of the bands.\nTake the gel out of the cassette. Hold the gel by the bottom part, which is thicker and reduces the chance of breakage.\nRinse the gel using abundant MQ-H2O before imaging (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1398-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Gel imaging. Each lane of the gel corresponds to a different animal, from left to right: S1, S2, and S3\nThe three most visible bands were selected for in-gel digestion and were numbered from top to bottom: band 1, band 2 and band 3. The selected band numbers do not reflect the bands selected in Gonzalez-Franquesa et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] and are used only as a technical demonstration of the presented protocol.\nImage using a camera or the Coomassie protocol in a Chemidoc XRS.",
    "Note: If imaging using a Chemidoc XRS, open the ImageLab software and create a new protocol, then under application menu, select the protein gels tab and then Coomassie Blue.\nIn-gel protein digestion\nTiming: 2 h (day 1) + overnight incubation + 2.5 h (day 2)\nDay 1\nIn this step, previously identified supercomplex-containing bands are selected (Jha et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Gonzalez-Franquesa et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), excised from the gel and inserted into different tubes (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Then, the gel bands are prepared for LC-MS/MS-based proteomics and the extracted proteins are digested into peptides (Shevchenko et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1398-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

In-gel digestion schematic workflow\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nNote: Special care should be taken to avoid contamination by keratins in the gel pieces which could interfere with the downstream proteomics analysis. Therefore, it is encouraged to use gloves during the following steps.\nPrepare the 2 mL tubes for the different bands and experimental conditions and place the gel on a cutting board.\nNote: Using round bottom tubes helps during this step as they allow for an easier resuspension and mixing of the gel pieces.\nUsing a scalpel cut the selected bands of interest into a long slice by performing a horizontal cut from end to end of the gel (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).",
    "Note: In order to guide the users on which bands to select for analysis, we have included the respiratory complexes composition of the bands analyzed in Gonzalez-Franquesa et al. (2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) in Figure 6.\nExcise individual bands as seen in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5], separating the gel slice using fine forceps and a scalpel before transferring the bands into the tubes.\nDe-stain the Coomassie from the gel bands by washing with 1 mL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC)/ethanol (1:1 volume). Incubate at RT in a rotating wheel for 20 min.\nRepeat step 21 for a total of 3 de-staining washes.\nNote: Incubate until Coomassie staining has been completely removed from the sample. If necessary, perform more washes (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1398-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Single gel band during in-gel digestion\nRemove the ABC/ethanol buffer using a pipette and add 1 mL of 96% ethanol. Incubate at RT in a rotating wheel for 10 min.\nRepeat this step for a total of 2 incubations with 96% ethanol.\nNote: After this step, the gel bands should shrink and turn white.\nAspirate as much of the ethanol as possible using a pipette. Care should be taken to avoid touching the gel bands. Let the cap of the tube open for the rest of the ethanol to evaporate, but do not allow for the gel bands to dry completely.\nNote: It is important to remove the ethanol from the tube as it might inhibit the enzymatic activity of trypsin during protein digestion.\nAdd 100 μL of Digestion buffer to cover the gel bands and incubate at 37°C, 700 rpm for 5 min in a thermomixer using the 2 mL SmartBlock.\nNote: Ensure that the gel bands expand in contact with the solution and lose the white color.",
    "Cover the gel bands by adding 250 μL of 50 mM ABC and place the tubes back in the thermomixer at 37°C, 700 rpm.\nSeal the tubes to avoid evaporation and incubate the mixture overnight (between 18 and 12 h).\nNote: To save time, prepare the stage tips that will be later used (step 38) during the incubation steps.\nDay 2\nThe next day, spin the tubes to ensure the gel bands are in the liquid.\nStart extracting the peptides from the gel bands by adding 35 μL (1:10 volume) of Buffer 1 into the tubes.\nIncubate the gel bands in the buffer for 20 min with gentle shaking in a thermomixer set at RT using the 2mL Smart Block.\nTransfer the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL tube using gel-loading tips to avoid gel pieces.\nAdd 100 μL of Buffer 1 to cover the gel pieces.\nIncubate as indicated in step 27a.\nTransfer the supernatant into the same tube used in step 27b.\nNow, dispense 100 μL of Buffer 2 into the tubes containing the gel bands.\nAgain, incubate as indicated in step 27a.\nCollect the supernatant into the same tube used in step 28b.\nProceed to add 100 μL of 100% ACN to cover the gel bands.\nIncubate as in step 27a.\nTransfer the supernatant to the tube used in step 29b.\nPlace the tubes in a centrifuge concentrator (with tube rotor) set at 45°C in alcoholic volumes (V-AL) mode and evaporate the buffer from the samples leaving 100–150 μL left (approximately 45 min).\nNote: If the buffer from the samples does not evaporate after 45 min, increase the temperature of the centrifuge concentrator to 60°C and resume evaporation until samples have the desired volume.",
    "Check the pH of the peptide solution using band strips and acidify the peptides by gradually adding 1% TFA solution until the pH is 2.5.\nPause point: The acidified peptides can be stored at 4°C for a week.\nPeptide desalting\nTiming: 2 h\nAt this point, peptides are desalted prior loading into LC-MS/MS instrumentation using in-house crafted C-18 filters (stage-tips) as previously described (Rappsilber et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Stage-tips are placed in an in-house 3D printed centrifugation-proof tip-holder rack that allows for the elution of loaded stage-tips into the 96 well microtiter plate underneath (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). Alternatively, Evosep tip boxes (EV2001, Evosep, Denmark) are also suitable for this procedure (Bache et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1398-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Setup used for peptide desalting\nStage-tips being held in a 96 well adaptor on top of a waste microtiter plate.\nActivate the C18 stage-tip filters:\nLoad 20–50 μL of 100% MeOH and centrifuge (500g, 3 min).\nNote: To avoid the stage-tip from drying completely always ensure there is a small volume on top of the C18 tips.\nWash with 50 μL of Buffer 2 (500g, 3 min).\nWash two times with 50 μL of Buffer 3 (500g, 3 min).\nNote: The stage-tips are now activated and are ready to bind the peptides.\nCentrifuge the peptide-containing tubes at maximum speed for 2 min to precipitate any particles present in the solution.\nTransfer the supernatant to the activated stage-tip.\nNote: Leave around 10–15 μL in the bottom of the tube to avoid any particles that could interfere with stage-tip peptide desalting.\nPerform cycles of centrifugation of 500g for 3 min until almost all volume has passed through the stage-tip and discard the flow through in each cycle.\nLoad 50 μL of stage-tip Buffer 3 and run cycles of centrifugation as indicated in step 35a.",
    "Repeat step 36 for a total of two washes.\nChange the stage-tip adaptor to a new and clean microtiter plate.\nElute peptides from the stage tips in a single step:\nLoad 40 μL of Elution buffer\nCentrifuge at 500g for 3 min.\nPlace the microtiter plate containing the eluted peptides in a preheated (45°C) centrifuge concentrator (with the plate rotor) in vacuum-aqueous mode until the volume has been completely evaporated (approximately 30 min).\nResuspend the peptides:\nLoad 10 μL of A∗ buffer into the sample-containing wells.\nShake the plate at 1,400 rpm for 10 min in a thermomixer.\nSpin the plate down in a centrifuge for 30 s at 750g.\nMeasure peptide concentration by assessing the A260/A280 ratio using a spectrophotometer. Adjust peptide concentration to 0.1 μg/μL in 10 μL of A∗ buffer.\nNote: Use A∗ buffer as blank during the spectrophotometry measurement.\nPause point: The plate containing the desalted peptides can be sealed to avoid sample evaporation and stored at −20°C indefinitely.\nNote: Even though the plates are sealed and stored at −20°C, evaporation can still occur. Therefore, peptides should be resuspended by shaking in a thermomixer set at 1.500 rpm for 10 min followed by a quick spin in a multifuge centrifuge for 1 minute before MS injection.\nMass spectrometry\nTiming: approximately 100 min per sample",
    "The liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) setup used in Gonzalez-Franquesa et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] consisted of a combination of an EASY-nLC nano-flow UHPLC system coupled with a LTQ Q-Exactive HFX Orbitrap mass spectrometer (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). Peptides from in-gel digested samples were injected on a 15 cm column packed with C-18 beads (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany), washed with 0.5% formic acid and separated using a 65 min linear gradient ranging from 5 to 40% of a 80% ACN, 0.5% formic acid buffer at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. Mass spectra were acquired in a data-dependent manner, with automatic switching between MS and MS/MS using a top-12 method. MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer with a mass range of 300–1750 m/z and 60,000 resolutions at m/z 200. HCD peptide fragments acquired at 28 normalized collision energy were analyzed at high resolution in the Orbitrap analyzer.\nTable 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] contains MS method parameters used in Gonzalez-Franquesa et al. (2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). This MS method is intended to serve as an example. When using other LC or MS instruments, users are recommended to adjust the MS method to their setup.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1398_16.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1398_17.csv",
    "Alternatives: Other HPLC and mass spectrometry instrumentation represent valid options for this analysis. In particular, Evosep One’s predefined short chromatographic gradients (e.g. 21 min) could substantially reduce the measurement time per sample although it might reduce the high resolution peptide separation achieved by an EASY-nLC (Bache et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Krieger et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Different mass spectrometers could also be considered for the MS analysis, such as other Orbitrap (e.g. Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Exploris 480) or Time of Flight (e.g. Bruker timsTOF) instruments (Meier et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Bekker-Jensen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). The user should carefully consider their LC-MS/MS set-up, the choice of which may be influenced by measurement time, number of samples, resolution, protein depth, and often machine availability.
