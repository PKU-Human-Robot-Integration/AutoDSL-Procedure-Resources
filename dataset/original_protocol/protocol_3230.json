    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nFixation of Cells and Binding Antibodies to Dynabeads\nTiming: 6 h to overnight\nThis section fixes cultured cells with formaldehyde, which preserves protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. In addition, antibody-beads complex is prepared for immunoprecipitation. When working with tissues, use an appropriate method to dissociate the tissue into single-cell suspension and start the protocol from step 2b. We normally use 5 × 105 cells for profiling histone modifications and 5 × 106 cells for transcription factors.\nAdd 1/10 volume of 11% formaldehyde solution directly to the culture media in plates. Swirl briefly and incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 10 min.\nAdd 1/10 volume of 1.25 M Glycine, swirl briefly and incubate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 5 min to stop formaldehyde crosslinking.\nFor adherent cells, remove all liquid in the plate, and rinse with ice-cold 1× PBS (pH 7.4) twice. Collect cells into 1 mL ice-cold 1× PBS (pH 7.4) supplied with 1% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) using a cell scraper, and transfer to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. Spin at 4°C for 5 min at 1,000 × g, and discard supernatant.\nFor suspension cells:\nTransfer enough cells into either Eppendorf tubes or conical tubes. If no serum is in the culture media, add 1/100 volume of FBS.\nSpin at 4°C for 5 min at 1,000 × g, and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cell pellet with the same amount of ice-cold 1× PBS (pH 7.4), spin at 4°C for 5 min at 1,000 × g, and discard supernatant. Repeat once.\nCritical: The addition of FBS during those steps help reduce the loss of cells, especially when the cell number is small.",
    "Cell pellets can be snap freezed in liquid nitrogen and store in −80°C for at least 6 months. Or cell pellets can be used immediately. See the next section.\nBind antibodies to Dynabeads. We use 10 μL Dynabeads and 1 μg antibody per ChIP. Protein A or G Dynabeads, or Pan Mouse IgG Dynabeads are chosen based on the primary antibody being used and the results from the previous section. Prepare each ChIP individually in different Eppendorf tubes.\nMix 10 μL Dynabeads with 500 μL Blocking Solution in the tube, and collect beads using DynaMag-2. Allow beads to set at the side of the tube. Invert twice or three times to collect beads at the tube cap. No need to centrifuge. Remove the supernatant with an aspirator.\nAdd 500 μL Blocking Solution to wash the beads. This can be done by removing the rack from the magnet and inverting the rack with tubes still in place for 20 times or until the beads are evenly distributed in the Blocking Solution.\nRepeat the above wash twice, to reach a total of three washes.\nResuspend the washed beads in 250 μL Blocking Solution, add 1 μg antibody, and put on a rotator at 4°C for at least 6 h or overnight (12–20 h).\nSonication and Immunoprecipitation of Chromatin\nTiming: 1 h hands-on time and overnight immunoprecipitation\nThis section describes the procedures to solubilize and break chromatin into appropriate size range, and use the specific antibody to immunoprecipitate the DNA bound by the protein of interest.\nIf using the frozen pellet from the steps described above, take the pellet from −80°C and thaw on ice.",
    "Resuspend the pellet of appropriate cell numbers in 300 μL Sonication/IP Buffer with freshly added 1× protease inhibitor cocktails, and sonicate on a Bioruptor Pico (or the alternatives) for an appropriate number of cycles based on the results from Before You Begin section.\nIncubate the chromatin with antibody-beads complex:\nCentrifuge the sonicated chromatin at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nDuring the 10-min centrifugation time, wash the antibody-beads complex from step 4d three times with 500 μL Blocking Solution in the same way as described in steps 4a and 4b.\nSave 2 μL supernatant from step 7a, and store in −20°C as the input sample, and transfer the rest supernatant to the washed antibody-beads complex. Incubate overnight (12–20 h) at 4°C on a rotator.\nNote: There should be very tiny or no visible pellet after the centrifugation at step 7a.\nWash Beads, Tagmentation on Beads, and Reverse Crosslinking\nTiming: 1 h hands-on time and 6 h to overnight reverse crosslinking\nThis section describes the procedures in to wash the immunoprecipitation and add sequencing adapters via tagmentation by Tn5. Then the crosslink is reversed by heating at 65°C. All wash steps are done at the bench with wash buffers kept on ice.\nPut the immunoprecipitation on DynaMag-2 to collect the beads at the side of the tube. Invert twice or three times to collect beads at the tube cap. No need to centrifuge.\nRemove the supernatant, and the buffer at the cap using an aspirator or a pipette.\nWash once with 500 μL RIPA Wash Buffer. This can be done by removing the tube rack from the magnet, add the buffer and invert by hand with the tube still on the rack for 15–20 times or until the beads are evenly distributed in the buffer.",
    "Wash once with 500 μL Low Salt Wash Buffer.\nWash once with 500 μL High Salt Wash Buffer.\nWash once with 500 μL LiCl Wash buffer.\nWash twice with 500 μL 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.\nNote: The washes from step 11 to 14 are performed in the same way as described in step 10.\nCritical: During the wash in step 14, the beads will not attach to the magnet very tightly. Therefore, DO NOT use the aspirator to remove the buffer. Instead, use a pipette to remove the buffer carefully.\nCollect the beads to the bottom of the tube by a brief centrifugation at 100 × g for 30 s.\nPut the tube on DynaMag-2 and remove trace of Tris-HCl.\nResuspend the beads thoroughly with 30 μL tagmentation mix, which consists of 15 μL 2× TD Buffer + 14 μL ddH2O + 1 μL Tn5. The Tn5 can be from either the Illumina Tagment DNA TDE1 Enzyme and Buffer kit or the Fapon Tnp Library Prep Kit for Illumina. You only need one kit, not both.\nTake the 2 μL input sample from −20°C, and mix with 30 μL tagmentation mix (the same as above).\nPut both the IP and input samples on the thermomixer to incubate at 37°C for 5 min with 800 rpm shaking.\nCritical: This incubation step allows Tn5 to add sequencing adapters to the immunoprecipitated DNA. At this stage, the DNA is still bound by the protein which protects the DNA from being cut by Tn5. Therefore, you do not need to worry about over-tagmentation. We used 1 μL for easy pipetting regardless of the cell number used here. What happens in the tube is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/300-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic View of the Tagmentation Process on the Beads\nStop the tagmentation reaction:",
    "For input samples, directly add 70 μL ChIP Elution Buffer, add 1 μL of Proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and leave at 65°C on a thermomixer with 1,400 rpm shaking for at least 6 h or overnight (12–20 h).\nFor IP samples, wash beads with 500 μL Low Salt Wash Buffer twice, then with 500 μL 1× TE 50 mM NaCl once. Perform the wash in the same way as described in step 10.\nBriefly centrifuge the IP samples to collect beads at the bottom of the tube. Put the tubes to DynaMag-2 and remove trace of 1× TE 50 mM NaCl.\nAdd 100 μL ChIP Elution Buffer to the beads, add 1 μL Proteinase K (20 mg/mL) and briefly vortex until the beads become homogeneous.\nLeave all samples at 65°C on a thermomixer with 1,400 rpm shaking for at least 6 h or overnight (12–20 h).\nCritical: In step 20c, the beads will not attach to the magnet very tightly. Therefore, DO NOT use the aspirator to remove the buffer. Instead, use a pipette to remove the buffer carefully. In step 20d, take care not to vortex the beads to the cap.\nDNA Purification and Library Preparation\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section describes the procedures of DNA purification and library preparation. See Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] below for the schematic view of this section with PCR details.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/300-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Schematic View of Steps of DNA Purification and Library Purification\nPurify DNA from both input and IP samples using the Qiagen minElute PCR Purification Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Elute the DNA in 11 μL Elution Buffer from the kit twice, which generally yields 20 μL DNA.\nNote: There is no need to quantify the DNA concentration at this stage. Use all for the next step.",
    "Setup the library PCR reaction per sample as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_300_15.csv\nRun a pre-amplification PCR using the following condition:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_300_16.csv\nNote: The combination of S5xx and N7xx primers identifies a sample. Therefore, different samples should use different combinations of S5xx and N7xx primers. If you do not have many samples, it is recommended to use different N7xx primers, because the index in the N7xx primer is sequenced first on an Illumina machine.\nCritical: Since the tagmentation process creates 9-bp gaps (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), the first step in the PCR should be 72°C to allow the polymerase to fill in the gaps.\nAfter the pre-amplification, take out 9 μL of the reaction, and mix with 1 μL 10× EvaGreen and perform a qPCR analysis to decide the optimal cycle number. Leave the rest 41 μL reaction on ice.\nUse the following cycling condition to perform a qPCR analysis, and monitor the amplification curve in linear scale.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_300_17.csv\nDetermine the cycle number N, where the amplification curve reach half way of saturation. In the examples shown in the Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] below, N = 11, 14, and 14 for the three different samples.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/300-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Amplification Plot of qPCR\nNote: The cycle number should be chosen at the exponential phase, before reaching saturation.\nOnce the optimal cycle number is decided, amplify the rest 41 μL reaction for a further of N cycles, using the following condition:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_300_18.csv\nCritical: Typically, the number N is between 6 and 14, i.e., the total number of cycles needed is between 10 and 18 cycles depending on the number of cells and the abundance of the protein. See Troubleshooting 2.",
