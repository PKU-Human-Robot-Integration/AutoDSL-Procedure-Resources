    "All procedures and animal handling were conducted in accordance with the animal care guidelines issued by the National Institutes of Health and by the University of Washington Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Surgery\nAnesthetize the mouse at 5% isoflurane in an induction box until unconscious. Confirm anesthesia by a reduction in the breathing rate and the absence of a withdrawal reflex following toe-pinch.\nMaintain anesthesia via nose cone at 2-2.5% throughout surgery. Monitor the breathing rate throughout surgery to ensure the mouse remains unconscious.\nPlace the mouse prone on a heating pad and position the mouse in the stereotactic device using ear bars, ensuring that the head is secure and flat.\nRemove hair from the scalp using hair removal cream. Rinse the scalp thoroughly with saline.\nClean the surgical site with an alternating iodine and 70% ethanol wash.\nAdminister a subcutaneous injection of Lidocaine and Bupivacaine (1 mg/kg) at the scalp.\nWith surgical scissors, make a longitudinal midline incision, and retract the skin to reveal the skull.\nUsing a 5 mm trephine saw preform a craniotomy over the left frontoparietal cortex with center point at 2.5 mm behind bregma and 2.5 mm left of the midline. Carefully remove the circle of bone to expose the brain.\nSet the impactor device to a velocity of 6 m/s and 200 ms dwell time.\nPosition the impactor device until the 3 mm convex impact tip is lightly touching the surface of the brain at 2.5 mm behind bregma and 2.55 mm left of the midline. Retract the impact tip, and lower by 1 mm (impact depth). When ready, fire the device, generating the desired impact.\nCover the craniotomy with a sterile polypropylene disc cemented to derma with tissue adhesive, and suture the incision closed.",
    "Remove the mouse from anesthesia, and give IP injection of Buprenorphine (0.5 mg/kg).\nAllow the mouse to recover in a clean cage, warmed by a heating pad. The mouse should be monitored for signs of pain or distress over the next 24 h.\n\tNOTE: Sham controls should receive identical treatment as above, with steps 1.8-1.9 omitted.\n2. Radial Water Tread Maze Construction\nBore 9 exit holes, large enough to accommodate 1-1/2 inch ABS DWV SPG x SJ trap adapters, at equal intervals around the circumference of a 32 inch diameter galvanized steel tub. Center these exit holes roughly 2-1/4 inches above the floor of the tub.\nFit a 1-1/2 inch ABS DWV SPG x SJ trap adapter into each of the exit holes, and secure with the included ring nuts.\nWith rubber stoppers, cap eight of the nine exits from the exterior of the apparatus. The final, uncapped exit will serve as the escape route. It does not matter which exit is designated as the escape route.\nAttach a 90° ABS elbow to the exterior end of the remaining exit. The 90° bend serves to prevent test subjects from visually determining the correct escape route from inside the maze.\nConstruct the escape box from any opaque box capable of being sanitized and roughly 30 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm in size. Cut a hole on the side of the box, directly above the floor, large enough to accommodate a the 90° ABS elbow.\nAttach the escape box to the terminal end of the 90° ABS elbow.\nSlightly elevate the escape box (less than one inch) above the surface of the floor. This allows ample room for an electric heating pad, or other heating source, to be placed beneath the escape box.",
    "Print and laminate at least 5 unique, visual cues. Use simple, high contrast images that can be easily discerned from within the apparatus. Black and white clipart shapes (triangle, square, circle) are recommended.\nUsing magnets, adhere the visual cues to the inner walls of the apparatus. Cues should be roughly equal distance apart, around the circumference of the apparatus.\n3. Radial Water Tread Maze Protocol\nNOTE: Water maze testing should begin only after the surgical site has healed (roughly one week post-surgery).\nPreparing for testing.\nAllow mice to acclimate to the testing room for at least 30 min prior to commencing testing.\nSanitize the apparatus using a 70% ethanol spray.\nFill the apparatus with roughly 1 inch of cold (12-14 °C) water.\nPlace an electric heating pad, or other heating source, directly underneath the escape box. Keep the escape box dark and warm throughout the duration of testing.\nPosition a bright light source over the apparatus.\n\t\tNOTE: If using a lamp that might be visible to research animals from the apparatus itself, take care to ensure that the lamp is placed in the same position each day. The lamp itself might represent another visual cue for the mice to use to locate the escape box, and moving it drastically from day to day might complicate results.\nTesting Protocol\nRemove the mouse from its cage gently by the tail, and place in the center of the apparatus.\nAs soon as the animal is in in the apparatus, begin timing.\nOnce the animal has found the correct exit, and has located/entered the escape box, stop timing and record the number of seconds required to find the correct path.",
    "If the animal attempts to climb into a terminating hole and does not spontaneously reenter the maze after 10 s, guide the animal back into the center of the maze by hand.\nIf the animal fails to find the correct path to the escape box within 3 min (180 s), score the trial as a failure and record as 180 s. Carefully guide the animal toward the correct path by hand.\nAllow the mouse to remain in the escape box for a 1 min, inter-trial rest.\nOnce the 1 min rest has passed, remove the animal from the escape box and return to its home cage.\nThoroughly sanitize the escape box and exits with a 70% ethanol spray to prevent the mouse from using olfactory cues to locate the correct escape route. This step should take no more than a few seconds.\nReturn the mouse to the maze for the next trial.\nRepeat Steps 3.2.1-3.2.9 until the mouse has completed a total of three trials, and has either located or been led to the escape box three times.\nFollowing the final 1 min rest, return the mouse to its home cage.\nDrain and replace the water in the apparatus between animals to ensure consistent temperature throughout testing.\nRepeat steps 3.2.1-3.2.12 for each mouse to be tested.\nOn the following day, repeat preparation steps 3.2.1-3.2.5. Take special care in ensuring that visual cues remain in consistent positions between testing days.\nTest animals using the above daily testing protocol for three trials a day for four days (training period), with a final three-trial test for memory retention on the fifth day. A sixth three-trial test (Long Term Memory retention) can be given on day twelve.\nDo not perform any tests between testing days five and twelve.\nAnalysis",
    "If a mouse fails to complete the maze in under 180 s during any two-day period (i.e., a total of consecutive 6 trials all scored at 180 s), consider the mouse insufficiently motivated by the testing conditions, and remove from analysis.\nCalculate the mean latency to complete the maze for each subject by testing date by averaging their three daily trials for that day.\nObtain group differences in memory retention using standard t-tests to compare groups at the fifth day test and long-term memory testing date. If more than two groups are being compared, one-way ANOVA followed by appropriate post-hoc analysis (such as Tukey's test) to follow up on any significance obtained should be employed instead.\nObtain group differences in the acquisition period (days 1-4) via repeated measure analysis of variance.\nSubscription Required.
