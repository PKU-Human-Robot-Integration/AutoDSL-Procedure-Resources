    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnesthetize mice\nTiming: 3–5 min\nThis section is the step-by-step procedure to monitor depth of anesthesia and ensure the mice have lost the sensation of pain before performing any surgical methods.\nPlace the mouse in an anesthesia induction chamber with 0.5 L per minute (LPM) of oxygen and 5% isoflurane.\nTurn on the oxygen tank so that it is set to 0.5 LPM. Turn on the isoflurane vaporizer to 5%.\nConfirm that the oxygen and isoflurane are flowing before you bring the mouse over to the induction chamber.\nCheck that the oxygen flow meter ball is floating to confirm oxygen is flowing through the tubing.\nOnce the mouse’s breathing has slowed and relaxed in the induction chamber, turn the isoflurane to 2% and move the mouse onto the surgical cloth in a prone position.\nPlace its nose and mouth into the nose cone.\nAssess the depth of anesthesia using a firm toe pinch.\nContinuously monitor tail, foot, or ear for blue coloration as this could be a sign of respiratory distress.\nPreparation of the wound site\nTiming: 8–10 min\nThis is the step-by step procedure to remove all hair from and sterilize the surgical site.\nWith one hand, gently pull the skin on the dorsal side of the body toward the inferior portion of the mouse.\nNote: The skin tends to gather under the ears. If you do not pull the skin down, you will not remove the hair above the shoulders and the skin punch biopsy will be performed much lower than expected.\nUsing the clippers, shave the dorsal side of the mouse.\nEnsure that the shaved area is large enough to make two skin punch biopsies.\nTrim about halfway down the back and laterally toward each front appendage.",
    "Add minimal depilatory cream onto a cotton swab and apply it to the area where the hair was trimmed.\nAfter about 1 min, wipe off the depilatory cream with a piece of gauze and 70% ethanol on the shaved area.\nThis will help wipe off the extra depilatory cream and sterilize the area.\nNote: Do not leave the depilatory cream on the mouse too long or the skin will become damaged (see troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nOptional: If there is still hair present, add a small amount of depilatory cream to the area and wait 30 s to one minute, and repeat the wash with 70% ethanol.\nUsing a cotton swab, apply Betadine to the shaved location on the back of the mouse to sterilize the area.\nPause for a moment to let the Betadine slightly dry so that it will be easier to perform the skin punch.\nPerforming the skin punch biopsy\nTiming: 8–10 min\nThis is the step-by-step procedure to perform two skin punch biopsies on each mouse.\nUsing a sterile skin punch, apply pressure lateral to the spine on the right (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The pressure applied to the skin should create a full thickness cutaneous injury extending through the panniculus carnosus.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2314-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Performing the skin punch biopsy with a sterile disposable biopsy punch\n(A) Apply pressure lateral to the spine on the mouse with a sterile disposable biopsy punch.\n(B) With pressure, twist the sterile disposable biopsy punch clockwise and counterclockwise until you feel that the biopsy punch has punctured the skin.\nTwist the skin punch biopsy clockwise and counterclockwise until you feel that the biopsy punch punctured the full thickness of the skin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) (see troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).",
    "If the skin punch needs to be lifted, make sure to place it back exactly where you initially had it placed. A circular indentation should be visible on the skin from the biopsy punch.\nApply force downward until “release” is felt, which is an indication that the punch tool entered the subcutaneous area.\nIf a clean cut with the skin punch was not made, use forceps to pull the skin upward, and carefully cut a full thickness wound in the skin while following the indentation line with sterile scissors.\nOnce a circular punch on the right side of the mouse is performed, follow the same steps to complete a second punch on the left side of the mouse’s back.\nWound measurements\nTiming: 1–2 min\nThis is the step-by-step procedure to measure the X and Y axes of each biopsy wound.\nUsing a caliper, measure in millimeters the X axis or the longest point spanning the length of the wound (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2314-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Measuring biopsy wounds in mice\n(A) Schematic demonstrating measurement of the longest point spanning the length of the wound using digital calipers.\n(B) Schematic demonstrating measurement of the height of the wound using digital calipers.\nRecord the measurement in the correct space on the data sheet according to X axis and mouse identification number (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nUsing a caliper, measure in millimeters the Y axis or the height of the wound (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nRecord the measurement in the correct space on the data sheet according to Y axis and mouse identification number (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nWound and animal care\nTiming: 30 min\nThis is the step-by-step procedure to properly tend to the biopsy wounds.",
    "If Tegaderm is not already prepared, cut a piece of Tegaderm into a small square that is only big enough to cover the area of the open wound.\nGently place the Tegaderm on the wound (see troubleshooting problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nRepeat steps 20 and 21 for the second wound.\nUsing a sterile syringe with a 0.36 mm permanently attached needle, place the needle parallel to the skin and approximately 3 mm from one of the wounds. Perform a single 0.1 mL subcutaneous injection of the 1:10 Buprenorphine Hydrochloride dilution per mouse.\nNote: Do not inject the Buprenorphine Hydrochloride solution too quickly or remove the syringe too quickly. Ensure that the needle is deep enough so the Buprenorphine Hydrochloride solution does not come out of the injection site. The full length of the 0.36 mm needle should be inserted underneath the skin for the injection.\nGently take the mouse out of the nose cone and place it back into its cage.\nFor the next 15–25 min, monitor the mouse for movement and quickened breathing."
