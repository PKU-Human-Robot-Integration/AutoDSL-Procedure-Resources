    "Animal experiments for this study were approved by the KU Leuven Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation (P153/2018). All mice were housed at the university's animal facility under standardized conditions (constant temperature of 23 ± 1.5 °C, relative humidity 40%-60%, and a day/night cycle of 12 h), with access to water and food ad libitum.\n1. Mice\nUse commercially available mouse strains, such as C57BL/6J mice, of young-adult age (8-12 weeks old). In general, 2-3 mice provide a sufficient number of AL cells for the protocol.\n2. Isolation and dissociation of mouse AL\nNOTE: Medium A, B, and C are prepared in advance19,20. Compositions are shown in Table 2.\nIsolation of mouse AL\n\t\nEuthanize the mice by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by decapitation (Figure 2A). Wash mice heads with deionized water to remove the blood and spray them with 70% EtOH to generate a sterile environment.\nUsing sterile surgical tools, remove the skin of the head between the ears (Figure 2B).\nOpen the cranium and remove the brain.\n\t\t\nBreak the 'nose bridge' (i.e., anterior part of the frontal bone; Figure 2B) with sterile scissors.\nOpen the cranium further with scissors, starting from the broken nose bridge toward the ears, on both sides (Figure 2C).\nRemove the cranium and the brain with sterile tweezers, without touching the pituitary gland (Figure 2D).\nRemove the diaphragma sellae with blunt tweezers, without damaging the pituitary. Discard the PL and the IL from the AL under a stereomicroscope.\n\t\tNOTE: The PL and IL are linked and thus removed simultaneously. These parts appear as white tissue, as compared to the pink-colored AL (Figure 2D).\nCarefully isolate the AL with blunt tweezers and collect it in a 10 mL Erlenmeyer flask, filled with 3 mL of medium A (see Table 2). Place the flask on ice until further processing.",
    "Dissociation of mouse AL\n\t\nRemove the supernatant (SN) medium A from the Erlenmeyer flask containing the isolated AL. Add 2 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) 2.5% trypsin solution and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.\nWithout removing the trypsin solution, add 2 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) DNase solution (2 µg/mL in medium A; sterile-filtered through a 0.22 µm mesh), and swirl the Erlenmeyer flask 10 times. Let the pituitary sink to the bottom (~1 min) and remove the SN.\nAdd 2 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) trypsin inhibitor solution (0.1 mg/mL in medium A; sterile-filtered through a 0.22 µm mesh) and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min. Let the pituitary sediment to the bottom and remove the SN.\nAdd 2 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) medium B (see Table 2) and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Without removing the SN, add 2 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) medium C (see Table 2) and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.\nLet the pituitary sink to the bottom and remove the SN. Rinse the pituitary three times with prewarmed (37 °C) medium C.\nDissociate the pituitary into single cells.\n\t\t\nAdd 2 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) medium C. Aspirate and expel the pituitary gland with a sterile, flame-polished Pasteur pipette multiple times, until fragments are not visible anymore.\nTransfer the suspension to a 15 mL tube with 4.5 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) DNase solution (2 µg/mL in medium A; sterile-filtered through a 0.22 µm mesh). Rinse the Erlenmeyer three times with 2 mL of prewarmed (37 °C) medium C and transfer the suspension to the 15 mL tube.",
    "Mix the collected cell suspension and filter it through a 40 µm cell strainer into a 30 mL tube. Rinse the 15 mL tube and the cell strainer three times with 2 mL of medium C and transfer the suspension to the 30 mL tube.\nPosition the tip of a glass Pasteur pipette, filled with 2 mL of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (in medium A; sterile-filtered through a 0.22 µm mesh), at the bottom of the tube and gently pipette out to form a visible density layer. Centrifuge at 190 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the SN by inverting the tube in one fluent movement and remove the remaining SN droplets with a P1000 tip. Resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold Advanced DMEM/F12 (Adv DMEM/F12) and quantify the cells with a cell counter.\n3. Establishment and culturing of AL-derived organoids\nNOTE: Thaw ECM on ice in advance (2-3 h for 1 mL) and keep it on ice for the duration of the protocol.\nOrganoid seeding and culturing\n\t\nCentrifuge the AL cell suspension at 190 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and remove the SN. Resuspend the cell pellet in Adv DMEM/F12 using the specific volume calculated to reach a cell density of 1.1 x 106 cells/mL.\n\t\t​NOTE: For instance, if the cell suspension contains 500,000 cells/mL, one must resuspend the cell pellet in 454.54 µL of Adv DMEM/F12 to reach the desired density of 1.1 x 106 cells/mL.\nTake out the volume of cell suspension needed for plating (according to the desired number of wells to seed for organoid development) and add ECM in a 30:70 ratio (30% cell suspension (in Adv DMEM/F12 ) and 70% ECM). Mix well by pipetting up and down.",
    "NOTE: For instance, for one droplet of 30 µL (see step 3.1.3), one should (gently) mix 9 µL of cell suspension (containing ~10,000 cells when taken from the 1.1 x 106 cells/mL suspension) with 21 µL of ECM.\nPer well, deposit a 30 µL drop of the cell suspension/ECM mixture (see step 3.1.2) on a pre-warmed (37 °C) 48-well plate. Turn the plate upside down and let the ECM solidify at 37 °C for 20 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Pre-warm the culture plates for at least 24 h at 37 °C.\nReturn the plate to its proper orientation and carefully add 250 µL of prewarmed (37 °C) PitOM (see Table 1) supplemented with 10 µM Rock Inhibitor (Y-27632).\nContinue to culture the organoids by changing the medium (devoid of Y-27632) every 2-3 days until the organoids are fully grown, which takes between 10-14 days (Figure 3A). Then, passage the organoids.\n\t\tNOTE: When aspirating the medium, make sure not to disrupt the ECM dome. Tilt the culture plate slightly and remove the medium from the bottom rim of the well. Fresh (prewarmed at 37 °C) medium should be added gently to the side of the well. If gel droplets de-attach, collect the organoids and resuspend and culture them again in a new ECM droplet.\nOrganoid passaging\n\t\nAspirate the medium gently and add 400 µL of ice-cold Adv DMEM/F12 to disintegrate the ECM and collect the organoids in a microcentrifuge tube. Wash once with 400 µL of ice-cold Adv DMEM/F12 EM. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nRemove the SN carefully and add 400 µL of prewarmed (37 °C) TrypLE Express Enzyme (1X). Mix by inverting the tube several times, and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.",
    "Add 400 µL of ice-cold Adv DMEM/F12 and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the SN.\nResuspend the pellet with 100 µL of ice-cold Adv DMEM/F12 and subsequently break up the organoids by vigorously pipetting up and down with a narrowed P200 tip (i.e., push down the empty tip against the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube, to reduce its opening diameter) until organoid fragments (with a diameter around 50 µm) are obtained (Figure 3B).\n\t\tNOTE: The dissociation mixture should contain predominantly organoid fragments and only a few single cells. Harsh dissociation of the organoids into single cells negatively impacts the re-growth of the organoids.\nAdd 800 µL of Adv DMEM/F12 and centrifuge at 190 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Remove the SN.\nPassage the organoids in a 1:2 to 1:4 ratio. Resuspend the pellet in an adequate volume of Adv DMEM/F12 as needed for plating and add ECM in a 30:70 ratio (30% cell suspension and 70% ECM). Mix well by pipetting up and down.\nSeed and culture the organoids as described above in steps 3.1.3-3.1.5.\n\t\t​NOTE: On average, 20 organoids develop per well from the 10,000 whole-AL cells seeded (0.2%). These passage 0 organoids can be split in a 1:2 ratio, resulting in >50 organoids developing per well (passage 1). Organoids can then be split in a 1:2 to 1:4 ratio during subsequent passages. Re-growth of the organoids slows down after ~10 passages (corresponding to 3 months of culture), concretized in gradually fewer and smaller organoids.\n4. Cryopreservation of AL-derived organoids and thawing\nCryopreservation of organoids\n\t\nFollow the passaging protocol from step 3.2.1 until step 3.2.5.",
    "Resuspend the organoid pellet (containing fragments and cells) with 1 mL of cryopreservation medium (Table 3). Transfer the suspension into a cryovial and place it on ice.\n\t\t​NOTE: Organoids (i.e., resultant fragments and cells) from up to four wells of the 48-well plate can be combined in one cryovial.\nPlace the cryovials in a freezing container and transfer them to -80 °C.\nAfter 24 h, transfer the samples to a cryobox and store them in liquid nitrogen (-196 °C) for long-term storage.\nThawing of cryopreserved organoids\n\t\nRemove the cryovial from the liquid nitrogen tank and place it on ice. Immediately proceed with the thawing protocol.\nThaw the solution with the cryopreserved organoid fragments and single cells at 37 °C (water bath).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not keep the solution for more than 2 min at 37 °C to avoid cell toxicity by DMSO.\nTransfer the content to a 15 mL tube containing 10 mL of ice-cold Adv DMEM/F12 with 30% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Rinse the cryovial with 1 mL of Adv DMEM/F12 with 30% FBS.\nCentrifuge at 190 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold Adv DMEM/F12 and transfer the suspension to a microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 190 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet in an adequate volume of Adv DMEM/F12 as needed for plating and add ECM in a 30:70 ratio. Mix well by pipetting up and down.\nSeed and culture the organoids as described above in steps 3.1.3-3.1.5.\n5. Validation of AL-derived organoids\nCollection and lysis of organoids for RNA isolation\n\t\nCollect and centrifuge the organoids as described above (step 3.2.1).",
    "Remove the SN and add 350 µL of lysis buffer with 1% 2-mercapto-ethanol. Vortex for 30 s and store at -80 °C or proceed immediately to RNA isolation.\n\t\t​CAUTION: Beware that 2-mercapto-ethanol is a toxic compound. All work must be done in a chemical fume hood while wearing nitrile gloves, a dust mask, and safety glasses. 2-Mercapto-ethanol can cause irreversible damage to the eyes and skin.\nFixation and embedding of organoids for immuno-histochemistry/-fluorescence staining\n\t\nCollect and centrifuge the organoids as described above (step 3.2.1).\nRemove the SN, add 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (RT) on an orbital shaker (100 rpm).\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA is a known human carcinogen that can cause irreversible damage to the cornea. All work must be done in a chemical fume hood. Nitrile gloves and safety glasses must always be worn.\nCentrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min and remove the SN. Add 1 mL of PBS, incubate 10 min at RT on an orbital shaker (100 rpm), and centrifuge at 90 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Repeat the washing step twice. Store in PBS at 4 °C.\nFor tissue processing and dehydration, remove the SN and add 150 µL of 2% agarose gel (in PBS) to the organoid pellet using a prewarmed widened p200 tip (made by cutting a small piece of the tip). Immediately pipet the entire volume up and eject in the lid of the microcentrifuge tube.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to work swiftly, as the gel containing the organoids will quickly solidify.\nLet the gel firmly solidify for 30 min and move the gel disc to a histology cassette. Immerse and store in 50% EtOH, until dehydration in the tissue processor.",
    "For paraffin embedding, place the gel disc (using forceps) in an embedding mold and fill with warm paraffin (60 °C). Place the molds at 4 °C until the paraffin is solid (approximately 45 min). These samples can either be stored at 4 °C or can immediately be subjected to sectioning.\nMicrotome the paraffin blocks containing organoids at 5 µm thickness and collect the samples on glass slides. Add one drop of deionized water underneath each section to allow proper stretching of the section and place the slides on a flat heating plate at 37 °C overnight. Store the slides with sections at 4 °C or directly continue with immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence staining.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
