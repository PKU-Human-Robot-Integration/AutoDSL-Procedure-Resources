    "The experimental protocol was approved by the European Animal Care Legislation (2010/63/EU), by the Italian Ministry of Health in accordance with the D.L. 116/1992 and by the guidelines of the University of Genova (Prot. N. 13130, May 2011). All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals for the project and to minimize their suffering.\n1. Preparation of Materials and Supports\nConstruct the mold to build the PDMS (Poly-Dimethyl-Siloxane) constraint by means of a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) milling machine. Such a mold is realized in polycarbonate with the central cylinder in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). This material allows an easier extraction of the mask once the PDMS has hardened.\n\tNOTE: The design of the mold has been performed by Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) and then delivered to the CNC milling machine.\nPrepare the PDMS elastomer. PDMS is an organic polymer. It is composed of two elements, a curing agent and a polymer. Mix them by a volume ratio of 1:10, one part of curing agent and nine parts of polymer. Put the two components in a Petri dish, shake and insert the mix in the vacuum chamber for 10 min to eliminate air bubbles. 3 g of PDMS are sufficient for one constraint.\nConstruct the PDMS constraint. Insert the PDMS material into the molder and put it into the oven for 30 min at 120 °C. The PDMS constraint has the shape of an ideal cylinder with an external and internal diameter of 22.0 and 3.0 mm, respectively and a height of 650 µm.\nThe day before the plating, couple the mask to the active area of the Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) by means of a tweezer under a stereomicroscope and sterilize the PDMS mask in the oven at 120 °C.",
    "Sterilize the glass microbeads (nominal diameter of 40±2 µm; certified mean diameter of 42.3±1.1 µm) in 70% ethanol for 2 hr in a conical vial and rotate every 30 min to expose all microbeads. \nRemove the ethanol solution from the vial and rinse the microbeads two times with sterilized water.\nCondition the central part of the MEA area delimited by the PDMS mask (diameter equals to 3.0 mm) with 24 µl of mixed solution of Poly-D-Lysine and Laminin at 0.05 μg/ml.\nCoat the microbeads with adhesion proteins, Laminin and Poly-D-Lysine at 0.05 µg/ml and leave them overnight in the incubator at 37 °C, to obtain a stable and long-lasting neuronal network.\nRemove the adhesion factors both from the glass surface of the MEA and from the glass microbeads. Aspirate approximately 95% of the coating solution with a pipette and apply a small volume- 24µl- of sterile water on the MEA surface. Aspirate again more than 95% of the water and let the MEA dry under the laminar hood for 1 hr before plating the cells.\n\tNOTE: In the case of microbeads instead, aspirate the coating solution and make a first wash with sterilized water and a second one with the basal medium and its supplement such as B27, in order to condition the glass surface where neurons will be plated. Do not let the microbeads dry. Leave them in suspension in the culture medium inside the vial.\nDistribute, by means of a pipette -200 µl-, the suspension of treated microbeads (about 32,000) onto a multiwell plate with membrane insert (pore diameter 0.4 µm) where they will self-assemble forming a uniform layer.",
    "Fill each well of the membrane with 0.5 ml of medium and put it in the incubator (T = 37.0 oC, CO2 = 5%) until the neurons are ready to be plated (3.2).\n2. Dissection of Embryos and Dissociation of Tissue\nHouse adult female rats (200-250 g) at a constant temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and relative humidity (50%) under a regular light–dark schedule (light-on 7 AM–7 PM) in the animal facility. Ensure that food and water are freely available.\nAnesthetize a pregnant female rat after 18 days of development (E18) using 3% isoflurane. Then, sacrifice the animal by cervical dislocation.\nRemove hippocampi from each rat embryo and place them into ice cold Hank’s balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+. At day 18 of development hippocampus and cortex tissues are very soft and do not need to be cut into small pieces. Further details can be found18,19.\nDissociate the tissue in 0.125% of Trypsin/Hank’s solution containing 0.05% of DNAse for 18-20 min at 37 °C.\nRemove the supernatant solution with a Pasteur pipette and stop the enzymatic digestion by adding medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 5 min.\nRemove the medium with FBS and wash once with the medium with its supplement, 1% L-glutamine, gentamicin 10 µg/ml. Remove again the medium with a Pasteur pipette and refill it again with a small amount (500 µl) of growth medium with its supplement, 1% L-glutamine, gentamicin 10 µg/ml.\nDissociate the tissue pellet mechanically with a narrow Pasteur pipette until a milky suspension of cells is apparent. It is not necessary to centrifuge the cell suspension.",
    "Dilute the small volume of cell suspension with the growth medium to obtain a final volume of 2.0 ml. Count the obtained cellular concentration with a hemocytometer chamber. Dilute this concentration at 1:5 in order to obtain the desired cell concentration of 600-700 cells/µl.\n3. Cell Plating\nPlate cells at a density of about 2,000 cells/mm2 onto the active area of the MEA, defined by the PDMS constraint to create a 2D neuronal network.\n\tNOTE: Each hippocampus contains about 5 x 105 cells, (1 x 106 for a single embryo). Dissect 6 embryos to get a total amount of 6 x 10 6 cells in 2 ml, and an estimated concentration of 3,000 cells/µl. Dilute this concentration at 1:5 in order to obtain the desired cell concentration and plate about 600-700 cells/µl. If the MEA area delimited by the PDMS constraint is about 7.065 mm2, and the total number of plated cells 600 cells/µl x 24 µl = 14,400 cells, the final density of 2,038 cells/mm2.\nPlace the MEA devices into the incubator with humidified CO2 atmosphere (5%) at 37 °C.\nDistribute 160 µl of the suspension with a cell concentration of 600-700 cells/µl (about 100,000 cells) onto the surface of the microbeads monolayer positioned inside the multiwell plates to complete the preliminary step for the construction of three-dimensional culture. Put the multiwell plates in the incubator with humidified CO2 atmosphere (5%) at 37 °C.\n4. 3D Neuronal Network Construction\n6-8 hr after the plating, transfer the suspension (microbeads with neurons) from the multiwell plates very carefully inside the area delimited by the PDMS constraint by using a pipette set for a volume of about 30-40 µl. After each transfer, wait for about half a minute, to allow the microbeads to self-assemble in a hexagonal compact structure.",
    "Once all the layers are deposited and spontaneously assembled, refill with a large drop of about 300 µl of medium the top of the area delimited by the PDMS constraint.\nPut the 3D structure coupled to the MEA in incubator (T = 37.0 oC, CO2 = 5%) for 48 hr before adding a final volume (about 1 ml) of growth medium culture with its supplement.\n\tNOTE: Consider the total number of beads on the multiwell plates with membrane insert (30,000) and the number of beads on a single layer onto the MEA device (6,000). The resulting 3D structure is composed of 5 layers of microbeads and cells. Taking into account that the 3D neuronal network is not geometrically perfect, the resulting 3D structure could be composed of 5-8 layers.\nThe day after plating, carefully add the final volume of the medium (about 900 µl) inside the MEA ring. Maintain the 3D cultures in a humidified CO2 atmosphere (5%) at 37 °C for 4-5 weeks. Replace half of the medium once a week.\n5. Confocal Microscopy Acquisition\nFix the biological samples to the stage of the microscope in a holder. Set the laser (Argon, 496-555 nm), the scan speed (400 Hz) at which to acquire the image, the gain and offset (-0.3%) of PMT for each image to capture the correct bandwidth emission filter and in order to avoid saturation and to increase the signal to noise ratio. The Results Section reports the values used to acquire the images of Figure 4.\nFor the acquisition of the z-stack sequence, first select, the value of z position of the top and the bottom layer of the sample, and then select the step size to make the acquisition.\nSubscription Required.
