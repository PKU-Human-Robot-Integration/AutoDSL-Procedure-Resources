    "NOTE: Perform all of the following steps under a sterilized fume hood according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP).\n1. Plasma Collection and Storage\nCollect 3 mL of peripheral blood sample in a K3E EDTA tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at room temperature at 1,880 x g for 15 min.\nRecover the supernatant plasma in aliquots of 450 µL.\nStore the samples at -80 °C until use.\nNOTE: Process the peripheral blood tube within 2 h of collection. When recovering the plasma from the tube, do not disturb the lymphocyte layer.\n2.

Do not disturb the interphase. Note the volume recovered and discard the tube containing the non-acqueous phase.",
    "NOTE: The 2x denaturing solution is stored at 4 °C and may solidify at this temperature. Before use, warm the solution to 37 °C, agitating occasionally for 10-15 min. Be careful to withdraw the bottom phase containing the acid phenol-chloroform, not the acqueous buffer that lies on top of the mixture. Preheat the elution solution or nuclease-free water to 95 °C. Be careful to heat an adequate volume of solution (100 µL per sample + 10% excess).\nSmall RNA enrichment\nAdd 1/3 volume of ethanol 100% to the aqueous phase from step 2.2.6 and mix thoroughly.\nPlace a filter cartridge into a fresh collection tube for each sample.\nTransfer up to 700 µL of lysate from step 2.3.1 and ethanol into the filter cartridge and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 s.\nIf there is >700 µL of mixture left, place the filtrate in a fresh tube and repeat step 2.3.3; repeat until all the mixture has passed through the filter cartridge.\nMeasure the total volume of the flow-through.\nAdd 2/3 volume of ethanol 100% to filtrate and mix thoroughly.\nPlace a second filter cartridge in a fresh collection tube.\nTransfer up to 700 µL of sample volume into the cartridge and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 s. Discard the flow-through.\nRepeat step 2.3.8 until all the mixture has passed through the filter cartridge.\nApply 700 µL of miRNA wash solution 1 to the filter cartridge and centrifuge the filter cartridge with the collection tube at 10,000 x g for 15 s. Discard the flow-through. Place the filter cartridge in the same collection tube.",
    "Apply 500 µL of wash solution 2/3 to the filter cartridge and centrifuge the filter cartridge with the collection tube at 10,000 x g for 15 s. Discard the flow-through. Place the filter cartridge in a fresh collection tube.\nPlace the filter cartridge in a fresh collection tube and repeat step 2.3.11 with 500 µL of wash solution 2/3. Discard the flow-through and transfer the filter cartridge to a fresh collection tube.\nCentrifuge the tubes with the filter cartridges at 10,000 x g for 1 min.\nTransfer the filter cartridge into a fresh 1.5 mL collection tube and add 100 µL of preheated (95 °C) elution solution or nuclease-free water.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 s to recover miRNAs and store at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: A white precipitate may form in the wash solution 2/3. This is excess EDTA released from the solution. Avoid drawing up these crystals during the pipetting steps.\n3. Perform Reverse Transcription and miRNA Pre-amplification (Table of Materials)\nPerform polyadenylation reaction\nThaw all reagents on ice, then briefly vortex and centrifuge to spin down the contents. In addition, thaw 50% PEG 8000, allowing it to reach room temperature.\nPrepare the reaction mix in a 0.5 mL centrifuge tube, obtaining a final volume of 3 µL of reaction cocktail for each sample.
