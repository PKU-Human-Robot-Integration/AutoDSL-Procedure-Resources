    "The protocol follows the guidelines of Nanoori Hospital's human research ethics committee. A written informed consent was obtained from all the patients with unilateral lower limb radiculopathy due to lumbar disc prolapse. The exclusion criteria were the presence of segmental instability, spondylolisthesis (more than grade 1), and the presence of significant spinal stenosis.\n1. Patient Position and Skin Marking\nPlace the patient in the prone position on the radiolucent operating table with the spine in slight flexion.\n\tNOTE: Indications for surgery in patients are as follows: intractable, frequently unilateral radiculopathy resistant to conservative measures (for at least 6–8 weeks), with or without associated axial back pain, a positive tension sign on physical examination, and radiculopathy correlating with radiographic evidence on confirmatory MRI studies.\nMark the midline of the spine, as well as the extent of the iliac crest, with a marking pen under an image intensifier.\nMark the paraspinal skin entry point along the center of the disc space using the manual back assessment method6: check the borderline between the back muscles and the abdominal muscles. Mark the skin entry points just medial to this borderline in mid-disc level both in Antero-Posterior (AP) and lateral X-rays.\n2. Local Anesthesia and Incision\nInfiltrate subcutaneous local anesthetic (2 mL of 1% lidocaine) around the entry point and then perform the skin incision of about 1 cm and infiltrate the trajectory with the local anesthetic (3 mL of 1% lidocaine) through a 23 G needle.\nInsert an 18 G spinal needle through the skin incision at a 25–35° angle to horizontal.\nPass the needle under the image intensifier through the fascia and the back muscles. Then, dock the needle at Kambin's triangle near the intervertebral disc.",
    "NOTE: Kambin's triangle is present at the posterolateral aspect of the disc. The hypotenuse is the exiting nerve root, the base is the superior border of the inferior vertebra, and the height is the thecal sac/traversing nerve root.\nCheck the free epidural space in Kambin's triangle by injecting 1.5 mL of contrast dye under the image intensifier. Provide local anesthesia in Kambin's triangle by injecting 8–10 mL of 1% lidocaine in the foraminal space followed by a booster injection of 2–4 mL of 1.6% lidocaine (8 mL of 2% lidocaine with 2 mL of saline plus 0.05 mL of epinephrine) 4–5 min after the initial injection.\n3. Discography\nInsert the needle in the discal space under fluoroscopy and perform discography by injecting 2 mL of 0.8% indigo carmine mixed with contrast.\n4. Insertion of Endoscope\nInsert a guide wire in the discal space through the needle and then remove the needle.\nThrough the inserted guide wire, slide the obturator in Kambin's triangle and anchor it over the surface of the disc space.\nInsert the working cannula through the obturator and, thereafter, introduce the endoscope into the Kambin's triangle.\n\tNOTE: The working cannula is the beveled type with an 8 mm outer diameter. The endoscope has a 30° viewing angle, a 7.3 mm outer diameter, a 4.7 mm-diameter working channel, and 251 mm of total length. The entire procedure is performed using constant saline irrigation.\n5. Surgical Procedure\nObserve the epidural fat and soft tissues in the Kambin's triangle through the endoscope prior to the entry into the disc (Figure 1A).\nClear the soft tissue and blood vessels over the annulus using the radiofrequency coagulator. Perform the annular fenestration with an annular cutter and enter the annulus under endoscopic vision.",
    "NOTE: To avoid any injury to the exiting and traversing nerve root during the approach, the operation proceeds with continuous feedback from the patient.\nObtain a half-and-half view of the epidural space and the disc space by inserting the bevel type of the cannula in the fenestrated annulus.\n\tNOTE: In the dorsal half of the half-and-half, the posterior longitudinal ligament, the epidural space, and the traversing nerve root and dura can be seen. In the ventral half, the annulus and the disc ventral to the posterior longitudinal ligament can be seen.\nLever the working cannula downwards to achieve an exact half-and-half view7 (Figure 2A and 2B).\n\tNOTE: Using the bevel-type working cannula, it is not easy for beginners to manipulate the exiting nerve root safely, so a round working cannula can also be used (Figure 3).\n6. Targeted Fragmentectomy\nAfter decompressing the protruded disc sufficiently, change the trajectory of working toward the symptomatic disc area.\n\tNOTE: The working channel is directed toward the suprapedicular notch in the inferior-migrated disc, the epidural space in the high-canal compromised disc and foraminal space in the superior-migrated disc (Figure 3).\nConfirm that all free fragments of the disc are removed by checking the free-floating dural sac, the exiting root, and the traversing root, and free the epidural space by rotating the working channel and the endoscope.\n\tNOTE: All patients undergo MRI on the day following the surgery (Figure 4 and Figure 5).\nSubscription Required.
