    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTiming: approximately 3 h\nThe section describes the step-by-step procedures to setup the Jz explants culture. This includes taking out the uterine horns from pregnant mouse, dissecting out placenta, separating placenta into different regions and setting up the explant culture.\nPreparation of junctional zone explants culture – Day 1\nTiming: 1–2 h (for step 1)\nTiming: ∼10–30 min (for step 2)\nTiming: ∼10 min (for step 3)\nTiming: 48 h (for step 4)\nDissecting out junctional zone from placenta\nNote: All dissecting instruments used below must be sterile or autoclaved\nRemoval of uterine horns from the pregnant animal at E12.5.\nWe have not tested the procedure at other gestational ages. However, the junction zone decreases in size after E16.5.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]\nCull the pregnant animal by cervical dislocation.\nSterilize the abdomen of the animal with 70% ethanol, blot dry with clean paper towel to remove excess ethanol.\nMake a skin incision in the abdomen with blunt scissors and the skin peeled back.\nNote: This can be done by hand or using blunt scissors.\nNote: Take care to prevent the outer skin surface touching the abdominal muscle and so avoid possible cross-contamination.\nUse a new pair of blunt scissors and a pair of blunt forceps to open up the abdomen.\nRemove the whole uterus and quickly submerge in 50 mL (per animal) ice-cold PBS in a Gosselin container and close the cap.\nNote: Keep the container on ice during transport.\nNote: Take the uteri to the Class I MSC (or the bench as described above) for the following steps.\nCarefully separate Individual implantations containing the embryo and placenta from the uterine horns and keep under ice-cold PBS in a sterile dish (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: Use sufficient PBS to submerge the entire implantation.",
    "Prepare a 35 mm dish containing ice-cold PBS for each implantation and leave it on the top of the ice.\nUsing blunt forceps take the uterine horns out of the container and place in a 100 mm dish containing ice-cold PBS and rinse briefly to remove material loosely attached to the tissue.\nUsing blunt forceps, grasp the junction between the two uterine horns and remove from the PBS.\nUsing fine scissors separate the implantations from the uterine horns by cutting between each one.\nNote: The myometrium may contract and expel the amniotic sac.\nPlace each implantation in a separate 35 mm dish with cold PBS prepared in step b.i. above. Place the lid on to minimize contamination.\nKeep the dish with the implantation, amniotic sac and placenta on ice until the next step.\nSeparating the maternal decidua and dissecting out the labyrinth region are performed under a stereo-microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A(b–e). For a better view, a schematic diagram of the images in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A is presented in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nProcess one implantation at a time in the 35 mm dish in ice-cold PBS.\nUsing fine forceps, first carefully remove the remaining uterine tissue still enclosing amniotic sac and placenta. If necessary, uses forceps to gently tear the uterine tissue apart.\nNote: Occasionally, the decidua separates from the placenta and adheres to the myometrium. If this happens, jump to step d below.\nUsing the same fine forceps, peel off the decidua layer from the basal (outer convex) surface of the placenta. Use the amniotic sac as an anchor to hold the placenta in position.\nAccess the decidual layer from the edge of the placenta.\nPeel off from the edge of the placenta gently and gradually extend towards the center of the disc to remove entire decidua layer (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C and 1D).",
    "Once the decidual layer is removed, separate the amniotic sac from the placenta.\nNote: At the position where the umbilical cord connects to the placenta and the embryo, use the fine forceps to cut the umbilical cord as close as possible to the chorionic plate of the placenta in order to minimise chorion/amnion contamination.\nCarefully dissect the labyrinth from the junctional zone with ultrafine forceps.\nLay the placenta flat with chorionic surface with umbilical cord attached facing upwards.\nNote: Identify the labyrinth as the central red area as it contains maternal and fetal blood vessels. The junctional zone is the paler, almost colourless rim.\nUse one forceps to gently hold the placenta and use another forceps to separate along the edge of the labyrinth. Push closed forceps into the boundary between the two and allow them to open slowly to tease the tissue apart. Continue around the disc.\nAfter completing the round, flip the placenta over. Use one set of forceps to lift up the edge of junctional zone layer and the other forceps to slowly tease apart the two layers towards the center of the disc until the two regions are completely separated.\nNote: If necessary, clean up the dissected junctional zone by removing any remaining labyrinth tissue which is pink in colour (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nTransfer the junctional zone to a new dish containing pre-cooled DMEM/F12 medium and keep on top of the ice until step 2).\nDicing junctional zone tissue.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2777-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

The procedure starts at the edge and gradually moves towards the center of the disc. (f) The dissected decidua, junctional zone and labyrinth. Scale bar =10 mm\n(B) Schematic diagram illustrating the steps in (A).\nDice the dissected junctional zone tissue into cubes approximately 1–1.5 mm3 in size using fine forceps inside an insert in dish containing the 2 mL Jz-medium under the stereo-microscope.\nPlace the junctional zone tissue from one or two placenta in a 15 mm or 24 mm diameter Netwell™ respectively.\nNote: If the placentas are from animals with the same genotype the same dish containing Jz-medium may be re-used. Otherwise clean forceps and new inserts are required for each placenta.\nNote: Clean the forceps by dipping in 70% ethanol following by serial rinsing in 3 pots PBS to remove residual ethanol.\nSet up ex vivo junctional zone explant cultures\nTransfer the 15 mm or 24 mm diameter inserts containing junctional zone explants into either a 12-well plate or a 6 well plate with well containing 1 mL or 3 mL Jz-medium respectively.\nNote: Make sure all tissue explants are submerged under the medium.\nCulture incubation\nIncubate the plate in a humidified 37°C incubator containing 5% CO2 and 10% O2 balance N2 for 48 h.\nCheck viability of the tissue by adding MTT (50 mg/mL) to the culture medium at a final concentration of 500 μg/mL. After incubation for 1 h in the incubator dark blue/purple staining indicates viable tissues (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In the higher magnification image, a few explants are not stained after MTT incubation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, arrows).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2777-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The junctional zone explants are viable after 48 h culturing",
    "After 48 h culturing, MTT was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 500 μg/mL and incubated in the incubator for 1 h. The dark blue staining indicates viability of the tissues.\n(A) Low magnification. Scale bar = 10 mm.\n(B) High magnification. Arrows show the explants that do not show positive MTT staining, indicating the tissue is dead or at the very least, has lost mitochondrial function. Scale bar = 1 mm.\nCollecting conditioned medium for downstream analysis – Day 3\nTiming: Approximately 3 h\nTiming: 1–3 h (for step 5)\nThis section describes step by step procedures for collecting and processing conditioned medium and harvesting explant tissues ready for downstream analysis.\nCollecting and concentrating conditioned medium\nAt the end of incubation, collect the junctional zone explant tissue from the inserts and place in a 1.5 mL tube and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis (Western blotting, PCR etc).\nFor the conditioned medium (CM) from each well, it can either collect separately or pool together in 15 mL or 50 mL centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge the CM at 4000 rpm (1771 g) for 30 min at 4°C to remove tissue debris.\nTransfer the supernatant (free of cell debris) to a new tube.\nIf the clarified CM is to be concentrated, transfer it to a Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator and centrifuge according to the manufacturer’s instructions until the desired reduction in volume is achieved. Transfer the concentrated CM to a 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: The CM is generally concentrated by 20 to 30-fold. Optimization is required to identify correct extent of concentration for different downstream processes.\nStore both junctional zone explant tissue fragments and concentrated conditioned medium at -80°C until further analysis.",
    "Critical: To avoid any contamination during explant culture, it is crucial to keep the entire procedure as clean as possible. All plasticware, glassware and instruments must be sterilized prior to use. Equipment and bench surfaces need to be disinfected with 70% ethanol prior to use.\nCritical: Keep lids/caps of all dishes and tubes closed whenever possible to minimise contamination. This is especially important when performing these procedures on the open bench.\nCritical: Keep placentas and dissected junctional zone under ice-cold PBS throughout the dissection procedure to minimise cellular stress."
