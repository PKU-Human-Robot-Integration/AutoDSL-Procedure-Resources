    "1. Preparation of Glassware and Cultures\nBefore proceeding with this experiment, prepare 5% sheep’s blood agar (SBA) plates for growing MRSA. Incubate SBA plates for 24 hr at 37 °C. After this time, single, well-isolated colonies should be present to be used for subsequent inoculations into liquid media. Store streaked SBA plates with single colonies at 4 °C for 1 - 2 months.\n\tNOTE: Sheep’s blood agar plates come in pre-made packs containing between 20 - 25 plates based on the manufacturer, and typically consist of a tryptic soy agar base with the addition of 5% w/v sheep’s blood.\nMake 500 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB) supplemented with 1% glucose and 0.1% NaCl. After this, collect and clean 2 glass test tubes. If autoclavable lids are unavailable for test tubes, use aluminum foil as a cap. Autoclave TSB and test tubes along with a box of 1 ml pipette tips.\nUnder a biosafety cabinet or near a Bunsen burner, pipette 5 ml of previously autoclaved TSB into autoclaved test tubes. Be careful to ensure that enough time has been given to let the TSB and test tubes cool to room temperature. From a previously streaked 5% SBA plate, inoculate a single colony into 6 ml TSB broth. One will contain MRSA, and the second test tube will be used as a negative control to ensure sterility.\nTake inoculated TSB test tubes and place them in a reciprocal incubator for 24 hr at 37 °C and at 200 rpm. After this time microbial growth should be apparent in the MRSA test tube while no growth should have occurred in the control test tube.\nTake 1 ml from 24 hr culture and pipette into 6 ml of fresh TSB. Incubate at 37 °C for 6 hr at 200 rpm.",
    "Pipette 1 ml of 6 hr sub-culture into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge for 3 min at 850 x g. Remove supernatant and re-suspend pellet in 1 ml of deionized H2O. Centrifuge, repeat, and re-suspend.\n2. Cleaning and Inoculation of Stainless Steel and Gold Substrates\nTake stainless steel and gold AFM sample disks (20 mm and 10 mm diameters respectively) and clean each side with 5 ml of deionized H2O. Hold sample disks in the dominant hand with forceps and use the subdominant hand to pipette 5 ml on each side of the sample disk. After washing both sides, place sample disks in a beaker containing 20 ml of deionized H2O followed by sonication for 1 min.\nAfter sonication use forceps to remove sample disks from the beaker. Place the disks so that they lean at a 60° angle against the edge of an open Petri plate onto a paper towel. Use the lid of the Petri plate to cover the drying disks. Let disks dry fully before proceeding. The drying time can vary between 4 - 8 hr.\nOnce dry, use forceps to place sample disks into a Petri plate.\n\t\nOptionally, functionalize the surfaces of sample disks with any material (e.g., collagen, hyaluronan, silver nano-particles, etc.).\nFor this experiment, use poly-L-lysine to coat the substrate surface. For poly-L-lysine functionalization, pipette 200 - 400 µl of 0.1% poly-L-lysine (in H2O) onto sample disks, and let incubate for 1 hr at room temperature in a Petri dish.\nAfter 1 hr, use forceps to hold the sample disk, and wash with 1 ml of deionized H2O. Let dry on paper towels as described in step 2.2.",
    "Take 2x washed re-suspended cells and plate 200 - 400 µl onto sample disks inside a biosafety cabinet. If sample disks are coated with poly-L-lysine, incubate for 0.5 hr at room temperature.\nAfter incubation of cells on sample disks, wash sample disks gently with 1 ml of deionized H2O. Let disks dry overnight before imaging.\n3. KPFM Imaging\nNOTE: For this experiment, use an Agilent 5500 series ILM-AFM.\nTo start AFM, turn on computer unit along with the AFM’s HEB and MAC III controller. Open AFM imaging software (e.g., Agilent’s PicoView). Be sure to initially select ACAFM or whichever the correct designation is on the AFM for imaging in intermittent-contact mode.\nUsing AFM forceps in the dominant hand, and holding the spring-loaded clip holder open with the subdominant hand, place a KPFM cantilever into to head-piece. Be careful when handling and transferring the AFM head-piece to the AFM as this unit (at least on the 5500 ILM-AFM) contains the fragile piezo crystal unit that controls X, Y, and Z scanning directionalities.\n\tNOTE: The KPFM cantilevers used in this case were Mikromasch conductive DPE (low-noise) cantilevers with average resonant frequencies of 80 kHz and spring constants of 2.7 N/m. Cantilevers with these resonant frequencies and spring constants were chosen due to their ease of use. Cantilevers with larger spring constants and higher resonant frequencies can also be used for imaging.\nCarefully load head-piece into the AFM and connect the appropriate wires (in this case two wires need to be plugged in: laser light and stage lift motor).\nAlign the laser onto the tip of the cantilever. Some units contain a camera functionality which allows for easier alignment. If camera functionality is not present on AFM, align onto the cantilever tip as described next:",
    "Rotate the front-to-back knob clockwise to move the laser overtop the cantilever chip. When the laser reaches the chip it will be blocked and will no longer be visible. Only turn the knob a few times.\nRotate the front-to-back knob counterclockwise until the laser spot reappears. The laser is now on the chip’s edge.\nRotate the left-to-right knob to position the laser on the cantilever. As the laser passes over the cantilever it will disappear and reappear in rapid succession. The laser spot should be visible in the frosted glass cover where the photodiode unit will later sit.\nTurn the front-to-back knob counterclockwise to move the spot down the cantilever towards the tip until the spot on the frosted glass disappears.\nTurn the front-to-back knob clockwise only slightly in order to position the laser so that it just sits on the cantilever tip. The laser spot will reappear on the frosted glass.\n\t\tNOTE: This is the laser positioning method for diving-board cantilevers. For triangular cantilevers, the alignment process differs slightly.\nOnce the laser is aligned, hold the stage lift motor in the “open” position for 10 sec to ensure enough space between the cantilever and sample when attaching the sample to the AFM.\nPlace sample on the KPFM sample stage. Ground the sample using a copper wire. Connect the appropriate wires from the AFM to the sample stage. Connect the stage to the AFM. In most cases the stage is held in place using magnets.\nIn the AFM software, tune the cantilever and then begin approach of the cantilever tip to the sample. Ensure that settling time is set at no more than 10 msec, and that approach speeds do not exceed 2.0 µm/sec in order to avoid tip damage.",
    "Once the cantilever tip is on the sample surface, select an imaging window size and ideal imaging area. Optimize I and P gains along with the cantilever set point so that topographical imaging is optimized.\n\t\nOnce topographical imaging is optimized, turn on KPFM module (either FM or AM mode; here, use FM mode). It should be noted that KPFM imaging is very challenging outside of 5 µm x 5 µm imaging window. Also, for optimal KPFM imaging, use a 512 x 512 resolution with slow scan speeds (0.02 - 0.05 lines/sec).\nFor FM-KPFM settings (not ACAFM settings), set the drive percent between 5 - 10%. Set the cantilever frequency between 1 - 5 kHz with a bandwidth of 2 kHz. Set I and P gains for the FM-KPFM settings to 0.3%.\n\t\nVary signal bandwidth and I and P gains between sample surfaces. To optimize SP imaging, further adjust signal bandwidth and I and P gains to obtain optimal images. The recommended range of I and P gains are from 0.22 - 0.35%.\nProcess and analyze collected KPFM images using post-image processing software to collect SP data.\nSubscription Required.
