    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWe have encapsulated the complex pipeline from Climente-González et al. (2021)1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] into a single command (see run the pipeline[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1] and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). The pipeline performs the following steps:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2325-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Overview of the pipeline stable_network_gwas.nf and its output\n(A) Visual depiction of the pipeline. The Manhattan plot comes from in Climente-González et al. (2021).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\n(B) Top 10 lines from the stable_consensus.tsv file applied to the data in Climente-González et al. (2021).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nSubsample the input GWAS dataset multiple times (five, by default) without replacement. Each equally sized subsample is analyzed independently, and only the final results are aggregated in the last step. The rationale is that the common part of the solutions obtained independently captures something true about the data. In contrast, the differing parts result from the sampling procedure and idiosyncrasies of the algorithm.\nCompute a chi-squared test of association between each SNP and the phenotype using PLINK 1.9.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nCompute a gene-level association score based on the association at the SNP level using VEGAS2.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nUse five algorithms to find important genes in a biological network: dmGWAS,2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] heinz,3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] LEAN,4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] SConES5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] and SigMod.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] SConES uses SNP-level information, while the rest uses gene-level information.\nCompile the solutions of the different methods on the multiple subsamples.\nRun the pipeline\nTiming: days (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment])\nRun the pipeline on your dataset to discover the set of associated biomarkers.\nInitialize the Docker daemon.\nRun gwas-tools’ stable_network_gwas.nf:\n> stable_network_gwas.nf \\\n--bfile <path> \\\n--with-docker gwas-tools\nThe flag --bfile indicates the base name (i.e., the path without the extension) of the GWAS files in PLINK binary format[href=https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats] (bed, fam and bim). For instance, if the three files are located in subdir/gwas_data.{bed,bim,fam}, it should take the value subdir/gwas_data.",
    "Note: The complete list of possible arguments are available in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2325-Mmc1.xlsx]. For instance, you can include a file specifying the gene-gene interaction network (step 10) via the --edgelist flag. Or a file containing the linkage disequilibrium reference panel (step 11) via the --vegas2_bfile_ld_controls flag. By default, their value is the same as in Climente-González et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nNote: If you need to re-run the pipeline, refer to Problem 3 in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nNote: Pipeline arguments like ‘--bfile’ (full list in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2325-Mmc1.xlsx]) need to be preceded by two dashes (‘--’), while Nextflow arguments like ‘-with-docker’ or ‘-resume’ (full list in Nextflow’s documentation[href=https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html]) are preceded by only one dash (‘-’)."
