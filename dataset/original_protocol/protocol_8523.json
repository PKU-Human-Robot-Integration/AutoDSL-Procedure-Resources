    "All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the University of Lausanne Animal Care Committee and the Service de la Consommation et des Affaires Vétérinaires of the Canton de Vaud.\n1. Surgery for EEG/EMG-ECG Recordings\nAnimal housing and selection.\nKeep animals (C57Bl/6J, 7 - 9 weeks, 25 - 30 g) in a 12:12-h dark/light cycle, singly housed, and under standard conditions (40% humidity, 22 °C), with food and water available ad libitum.\nUse only male subjects to avoid all influences of the hormonal cycle on sleep.\nPreparation of electrodes.\nBuild EEG/ECoG electrodes (used in step 1.3.11) using ~0.5 cm-long pieces of gold wire (75% Au, 13% Ag, and 12% Cu; diameter: 0.2 mm), each soldered on top of a gold-plated steel screw (3 mm length, 1.1 mm diameter at the base; see Figure 1). Prepare 2 EEG electrodes per animal and clean them in 70% ethanol.\nPrepare EMG-ECG electrodes with 3 - 4 cm-long gold wires (75% Au, 13% Ag, and 12% Cu; diameter: 0.2 mm). Bend the wires at a 90° angle 1 cm from one end and prepare a coil (1 - 2 mm ø) at the other end (Figure 1). Between the two ends, bend the wire to create a small curvature that corresponds to the surface profile of the bone between the cerebellum and lambda.\n\t\t\nPrepare 2 EMG-ECG electrodes per animal.\nPrepare a 6-channel female-to-male head connector (raster: 2.54 mm x 2.54 mm, size: 5 mm x 8 mm x 9 mm, pin size: 5 mm; see Figure 1).\n\t\t\nCover the connector at the base of both female and male pins with tape.",
    "Add a small amount of soldering wire to the tips of 4 of the 6 male pins to help with the soldering of the EEG and EMG-ECG electrodes during the surgery (see step 1.3.16).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55863/55863fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic Display of the Sites for EEG and EMG Electrode Implantation on the Skull of the Mouse. \nCraniotomies #1 and #2 are located ~2 mm lateral to the midline and ~2 mm rostral to bregma. Craniotomies #3 and #4 are located ~2 mm rostral to lambda and are, respectively, 4 and 2 mm lateral to the midline. The two EEG electrodes, made from soldering a gold wire to the top of a gold-plated steel screw (#2 and #4) are on the right hemisphere. The 2 left screws (#1 and #3) serve as supports. Note that EMG-ECG electrodes should not be in contact with these 2 supporting screws. EMG-ECG electrodes are 3 - 4 cm-long gold wires, bent at 90° angles over 1 cm on their rostral ends and coiled (1 - 2 mm ø) on the caudal ends. The 2 EEG and 2 EMG electrodes are connected to the 2 x 3-channel head connector by soldering one wire to one cornered pin, as shown by the dashed lines. Further detailed information on these electrodes and their implantation can be found in 29.

Inject 5 µg/g carprofen intraperitoneally (i.p.) when removing the mouse from the chamber, prior to stereotaxic fixation.",
    "Follow standard procedures to fix the mouse on the stereotaxic apparatus. Maintain isoflurane anesthesia through a gas mask (3% isoflurane + O2 during fixation at 1 L/min). Maintain the body temperature throughout the surgery at 37 °C using a heating pad.\n\t\t\nProtect the eyes from drying out by applying vitamin A ointment. Check the level of surgical tolerance of the animal by testing the paw withdrawal reflex.\nFix the head by positioning the ear bars on the skull with their blunt, reverse ends rather than their tips (without entering the ear canals)29. Position the mouth bar (as usual) to ensure the horizontality of the head.\n\t\tNOTE: Fixation minimizes damage to the ears, which is important for the acoustic arousal experiments (see section 4 of this procedure).\nMonitor the animal's respiration during the procedure, which should remain at ~2 - 3 breaths/2 s. Adjust the isoflurane concentration in the gas dispenser if necessary; it should decrease little by little during the surgery, from 3% during fixation to 1.0 - 1.5% towards the end of the procedure.\nInject 100 µL of 0.9 % NaCl i.p. once per hr using an ultra-fine insulin syringe to keep the animal hydrated.\nEnsure that the animal's head is lit by a bright light source.\nClean the area with 70% EtOH and iodine-based disinfectant (wet fur prevents hair from entering the surgical window).\nLift the skin at the center of the skull with Adson forceps and gently cut the lifted portion of the skin along the midline, from the top of the neck to the level of the eyes, using fine scissors. Remove the scalp (~1 cm anteroposterior, ~0.5 - 0.8 cm lateral).",
    "Ensure that the window is large enough (towards both sides) to clearly see the bregma and the lambda fissures of the skull. Fix the skin on both sides with bulldog serrefines to ensure access to the bone.\nRemove the conjunctive tissue (periosteum) by carefully scratching with a scalpel. Clean the area with iodine-based disinfectant and dry the skull with an antiseptic swab.\nUsing a sharp scalpel blade (size 15), scratch the skull to obtain a cleaned and mattified bone surface. Using only the scalpel tip, scratch a grid-like meshwork of grooves, with a distance of ~1 - 2 mm between the grooves.\n\t\tNOTE: This improves the attachment of the two-component epoxy glue to the skull at step 1.3.15.\nUse a microdrill with a 1/005 drill-size to perform 4 craniotomies (~0.7 mm ø) in the skull at specific locations (Figure 1; also see step 1.3.11.3.). Blow away bone dust using a Pasteur pipette and clean any bleeding with antiseptic swabs.\n\t\t\nIf bleeding occurs, ensure that it is stopped completely before resuming the process. Use a hemostatic sponge to accelerate hemostasis.\nUse the two craniotomies on the right hemisphere to insert the screw electrodes (craniotomies #2 and #4).\nUse the two craniotomies on the left hemisphere to insert anchoring screws that will stabilize the implant (craniotomies #1 and #3).\n\t\t\tNOTE: To increase stability, up to 4 anchoring screws have been used29.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The precise stereotaxic coordinates are: 2 mm from the midline on both hemispheres and 2 mm rostral from bregma (craniotomies #1 and #2), 2 mm rostral from lambda and 4 mm lateral-left from midline (craniotomy #3), 2 mm rostral from lambda and 2 mm lateral-right from midline (craniotomy #4). See Figure 1.\nOn the left hemisphere, screw two gold-plated screws through the craniotomies for support.",
    "Fix the screw in a hemostatic clamp and hold it vertically above the craniotomy. Carefully approach the bottom of the screw on top of the craniotomy. Rotate it while not deviating from the vertical position.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Only 1.5 rotations are sufficient to obtain good mechanical stability and high-quality signals while minimizing pressure on the underlying tissue25.\nOn the right, screw the previously prepared electrodes (described in step 1.2.1.) through the craniotomies.\nWith the help of forceps, carefully lift the border of the skin from the neck muscles. Insert the EMG-ECG wires, with the coiled ends inside the muscles (left and right). Glue the middle parts to the skull, such that the left EMG-ECG comes out next to the posterior left anchoring screw, while the right EMG-ECG is positioned next to the anterior left anchoring screw.\nTo detect ECG signals from the heart during sleep, ensure that the EMG-ECG wires are inserted into the muscle to a depth of ~0.8 - 1 cm, with their loop ends as far from each other as possible.\nUse a spatula covered with two-component epoxy glue to apply the glue to the skull between and around the screws. Let it dry in the light, but protect the eyes of the animal from excessive lightning.\n\t\tNOTE: The bases of the screws must be covered, and only the wires should be accessible, emerging from the glue.\nMake sure that the glue fills the space between the two EMG-ECG electrodes extending from the surface, such that there is no electrical contact between them and the support screws. Pay meticulous care not to glue the skin to the skull; the skin should remain free to move around the glue.",
    "Cut the EEG and EMG-ECG wires such that they reach ~0.5 mm out of the glue. Solder the four pins at the corner of the connector prepared in step 1.2.3. to the four wires emerging from the glue (Figure 1).\n\t\t\nTry to place the connector pins as closely as possible to minimize the height of the implant; use a small crocodile clamp attached to the stereotactic holder that maintains the position of the connector. Minimize the time in contact with the soldering tip, as this rapidly heats the screws.\nFill the space between the glue and the connector with dental cement to cover the soldered parts. Create smooth faces and avoid sharp edges that could hurt the animal. Moreover, avoid touching the skin, as this leads to itching.\nRemove the bulldog serrefines. If necessary, close the wound using a sterile suture thread (absorbable suturing fiber) in front and behind the connector, creating simple, interrupted closure patterns and two square knots (5-0 FS-3 needle, 45-cm filament).\nMonitor the animal until it is fully awake. Weigh the animal after the surgery and return it to its home cage for recovery.\nPost-operative care and connection to the system.\nMonitor the animal every day for a week. Look for weight loss, reduced or abnormal activity, and signs of infections. Follow the scoring procedure established by your veterinary authorities.\n5-6 days after surgery, connect the recording cable to the head connector on the animal, leaving it in its home cage. Wait an additional 4 - 5 days before the start of recording so that the animal is habituated to the condition and sleeps naturally.\n2. Basic Scoring of EEG/EMG-ECG Data for Vigilance State Determination",
    "Record EEG and EMG-ECG data over 48 h with a commercial polysomnographic software (e.g., Somnologica, SleepSign, or Sirenia). Use typical settings, such as 2,000x gain; a 2,000-Hz sampling rate at acquisition, down sampled to 200 Hz after acquisition; and a 0.7-Hz high-pass filter for EEG and a 10-Hz high-pass filter for EMG-ECG.\nExport the data in the \".edf\" file format.\nOpen the \".edf\" files with a custom-written (e.g., in Matlab) software that semi-automatically classifies every 4-s epoch as awake, non-REM sleep, REM sleep, and corresponding artefacts.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, there are several semi-automated scoring software available. This procedure describes some of the basic steps that must be done to set up scoring with the scoring software used here; other semi-automatic scoring systems might be based on other parameters.\nUsing the software, separate the \".edf\" files in 4 times 12 h of recordings.\n\t\nRemove artefacts that arise from EMG -ECG activity present in the EEG signal or from an unassignable behavioral state1,29.\nCalculate the mean of absolute EEG (EEGmean) and EMG (EMGmean) values over the 12 h of recordings from the EEG and the EMG-ECG traces, respectively.\nIdentify the mean EEG/EMG values of each 4-s epoch (EEGEpoch/EMGEpoch).\nClassify the epochs as \"Wake\" when EEGEpoch<EEGmean and EMGEpoch>EMGmean and as \"Non-REM sleep\" when EEGEpoch>EEGmean and EMGEpoch<EMGmean.\nClassify the epochs that do not satisfy these criteria with a correcting algorithm based on preceding and subsequent epochs.\nClassify the epochs as REM sleep when EEGEpoch<EEGmean and EMGEpoch<EMGmean.\nRefine the critical points, such as transitions from non-REM sleep to wake, REM sleep epochs, and micro-arousals during non-REM sleep. Visually inspect the scoring to ensure proper vigilance state determination29,30.\n\t\tNOTE: Always perform a final visual inspection and validation of the scoring.\n3. Analysis of the Infra-slow Oscillation For EEG And Heartbeats",
    "For this analysis, select only non-REM sleep bouts lasting ≥ 96 s (i.e., at least 24 epochs of 4 s); see Figure 2.\n\tNOTE: Customized routines are available upon request1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55863/55863fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Determining Sigma Power Dynamics During Undisturbed Non-REM Sleep. \n(A) Top, EEG (black) and EMG-ECG (gray) traces during the first 100 min of the light phase in one mouse. Vigilance states are indicated by the colored bar on top of the raw traces. Middle, typical example of a continuous (>96-s) non-REM sleep bout. Bottom, a randomly picked, 16-s interval that illustrates the subdivision into 4-s epochs. The following step of the analysis is shown for these four epochs only, but it is valid for every epoch contained in the bout. (B) Top, four successive FFTs generated from the 4-s epochs shown in the bottom panel of A. The sigma band (10-15 Hz) is shaded in red. Top right, 1-s inset from the last epoch showing the R-waves present in the squared EMG-ECG signal. Bottom, time course of the sigma power extracted from the corresponding spectrum above. The dotted lines illustrate the continuation of the power values prior to and after the four non-REM bouts selected for display. (C) Normalized sigma power (red) and heartbeat (in BPM) (gray) time courses, with the portion illustrated in (B) located between the vertical dashed lines. Below is the corresponding filtered EEG signal in the sigma band (10 - 15 Hz). (D) Result of the FFT computed on the sigma power time course shown in (C), demonstrating a dominant peak at 0.016 Hz. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55863/55863fig2large.jpg]\nExtract the power values for the sigma frequency band (10-15 Hz) spectral power in 4-s bins ( Figure 2A and B) using calculations of fast Fourier transforms (FFT)1.",
    "Calculate the baseline spectral power for non-REM sleep by averaging the values in each frequency bin for all non-REM sleep epochs (artifacts and epochs of transition between vigilance states are excluded from this averaging). Normalize the sigma power values of each epoch to the mean power of the sigma band during non-REM sleep over the time period of interest. Plot against time (Figure 2C).\nCalculate the FFT of the sigma power time course with Hamming windowing to reveal the oscillatory frequency components of the power dynamics (Figure 2D)1.\nNote that since the non-REM sleep bouts have different durations, the resulting FFTs have different frequency resolutions. Interpolate to adjust the resolution to the highest one obtained from the longest non-REM sleep bout and average the FFTs of all bouts.\nContinue these analyses to describe the phase relationships between the dynamics of EEG and ECG signals.\nExtract the heartbeat data from the squared EMG-ECG signal after 30-Hz high-pass filtering, using appropriate routines for the peak detection of the R wave.\n\tNOTE: Constraining the minimum time interval between two successive R waves to 80 ms helps to avoid the inclusion of occasional artefactual peaks due to muscle twitching1.\nMeasure the RR intervals and calculate the mean heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) every 4-s bin (Figure 2B and C).\n4. Exposure to Noise\nGenerate noises (i.e., white noise) through a custom-written software. Set the duration to 20 s and the intensity to 90 dB SPL (measured inside the cage). Play the noises through standard active speakers1.\nAfter the surgery, during the habituation to the recording condition, play experimental noises randomly, several times throughout the day and at different moments1.",
    "In the experimental condition (while recording EEG/EMG/ECG data), play noise pseudo-randomly during the first 100 min at light onset (ZT0). To play the noise, fulfill the following conditions1:\n\t\nEnsure that the mouse has been in non-REM sleep for > 40 s.\nEnsure that the previous exposure occurred more than 4 min before.\n\t\tNOTE: This results in ~15 exposures per session.\nMark the beginning of the recording time and the onset of each noise exposure. Keep the experimenter blind to the spectral composition of non-REM sleep during the procedure.\nAcquire all data with polysomnographic software1,29.\n5. Retrospective Analysis of Sleep Based on the Behavioral Outcome During Exposure to Noise\nManually score EEG/EMG -ECG traces in a 4-s resolution, without knowledge of the noise exposure times1.\nUse a custom-written script to extract the EEG/EMG -ECG/noise exposure data1.\nScore as sleep-through when both EEG and EMG signals remain unaltered during noise exposure (Figure 3A). Consider a wake-up when EEG amplitude decreases and the EEG frequency increases, in combination with detected muscular activity on the EMG-ECG electrode (Figure 3B).\nDiscard trials in which animals woke up during the pre-stimulus period or in the first 4 s of noise exposure (Figure 3D).\nDefine the arousal success rate as the proportion of wake-up trials within all included trials (\"Wake-up\" and \"Sleep-through\").\nIn all included trials, examine the dynamics of the sigma power during the pre-stimulus period (Figure 3E)1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55863/55863fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Behavioral Outcomes in Response to Noise Onset: Representative Results that Were Retained or Excluded from Analysis.",
    "(A-D) Raw traces of the EEG (black) and corresponding EMG-ECG (gray) signals for 40 s before noise onset and during the 20 s of noise, represented by the blue-shaded area. Vigilance states are indicated in the color code. To illustrate data that were included in the analysis, representative \"Sleep-through\" (A) and \"Wake-up\" (B) events are shown. Results that were discarded contained transitions to REM sleep (C) and a precocious \"Wake-up\" response (D). The inset shows an expanded portion of EEG and EMG-ECG traces characteristic for REM sleep. (E) Typical examples of sigma power dynamics in the 40-s window before noise onset during a \"Sleep-through\" (left) and a \"Wake-up\" (right) event. The raw EEG trace bandpass-filtered for the sigma band is shown above. The blue area represents the noise onset.
