    "1. Sample Preparation\nGenerate a transgenic C. elegans strain of interest using transgenic methodologies18. Alternatively, obtain appropriate strains from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC). To visualize axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors, use the transgenic line wyIs251 [Pmig-13::gfp::rab-3]7. To observe IFT, obtain the transgenic line mnIs17 [osm-6::gfp]19. These strains are used in this protocol.\n\tNOTE: Either extrachromosomal array, genomic integration, or even GFP knock-in works. To reduce background signals, use cell-specific promoters, rather than pan-neuronal promoters.\n\tNOTE: Maintenance of worms is described in other protocols20. Strains were maintained on lawns of Escherischia coli OP50 feeder on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates (1.7% (w/v) agarose, 50mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) peptone, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mg/mL cholesterol, 25 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4 on 60 mm diameter plastic dishes) at 20 °C.\nGrow worms at 20 °C on NGM plates to any life cycle stage of the worms.\n\tNOTE: One can observe both axonal transport and IFT at any stage. Late L4 to young adult is a good positive control because multiple publications have used these stages and visualized trafficking events14,21,22,23.\n2. Preparation of 10% Agarose\nNOTE: Many vendors provide similar products such as agar, agar powders, and agarose. Use electrophoresis grade agarose (gel strength >1200 g/cm2). Cheap agar powders do not work because the resulting gel is not strong enough to immobilize worms.\nMix 0.4 g agarose in 4 mL distilled water (DW) in a glass tube (1.5 cm x 10.5 cm). Put a lid on the glass tube to avoid evaporation.",
    "Put the glass tube on a 95 °C heat block for 90 min. In addition, prepare another glass tube (1.5 cm x 10.5 cm) filled with DW and keep it at 95 °C. Put a Pasteur pipet in the 95 °C DW (Figure 1A). A lot of small bubbles will be seen in the agarose tube and the solution should be turbid. Leave it until the solution becomes clear. Then, mix by pipetting up and down until the agarose solution becomes homogeneous.\n\tNOTE: Microwaves cannot be used to prepare 10% agarose solution when made from DW and agarose. Small bubbles caused by microwaves prevent agarose melting. However, solidified 10% agarose gel can easily be melted again using a microwave. Glass tubes containing 10% agarose gel can be prepared ahead of time and stored at 4 °C for at least 6 months. If doing so, melt the stock using a microwave when needed and start from step 3 in this protocol.\n\tNOTE: Agarose gradually loses the ability to solidify if incubated at 95 °C for a long time or after repeated solidification and melting. If this happens, prepare new 10% agarose.\n3. Preparation of Agarose Pad\nUsing the warmed Pasteur pipet prepared in step 2.2, place 2 drops of 10% agarose on a 76 x 22 mm slide.\nQuickly cover with a second 76 x 22 mm2 slide before the agarose drop solidifies as shown in Figure 1B, and push down on the second slide to flatten the agarose solution. The thickness should be 0.5-1 mm.\nQuickly flush the Pasteur pipette by pipetting 95 °C DW up and down until the agarose solution is washed out. Otherwise, the pipet will become clogged by agarose gel. Leave the pipette standing in the 95 °C DW.",
    "Wait for 1 min. The agarose pad forms and becomes cloudy. Then, slide the slides apart by hand (Figure 1C).\n4. Mounting of Worms\nNOTE: Even small amounts of worm movement prevent good observation. Levamisole has traditionally been used to prevent worm movement on the agarose pad24,25. However, Levamisole inhibits neuronal receptors in C. elegans, and therefore may affect trafficking events in neurons15. Using polystyrene microbeads described hereis a good alternative17.\nUnder a stereo microscope equipped with a slidable mirror transillumination, transfer ~30 transgenic worms expressing the appropriate markers to a new NGM plate without bacteria using a platinum wire pick.\n\tNOTE: A platinum wire pick is made of platinum wire and Pasteur pipette (5 inches), and the tip of the platinum wire was flattened. The preparation of the platinum wire picks and handling of worms with these are described in the Wormbook (http://www.wormbook.org).\nLeave the plate for 1 min. Bacteria are automatically removed from the surfaces of worms as the worms move on NGM agarose gel without bacteria.\nPut a 0.5-1.0 µL drop of 2.6% 100 nm diameter polystyrene microbeads in water onto the agar pad (Figure 1D). Transfer 10-20 worms from the bacteria-free NGM plate to the microbeads. Drop and spread the worms using the platinum wire pick to avoid the overlapping of worm bodies (Figure 1E).\nApply a 22 x 40 mm2 coverslip (Figure 1F). Push gently to remove air bubbles, but avoid crushing worms. The sample is now ready for imaging.\n\tNOTE: Because no anesthesia is administered, worms are fixed only by the frictional force generated by the agar pad, polystyrene microbeads, and coverslip17. The presence of feeder bacteria and/or too much solution will make the frictional force weaker.",
    "NOTE: Different sizes of coverslips (e.g., 22 x 22 mm2, 18 x 18 mm2) work. However, larger coverslips can prevent immersion water or oil from the objective lens leaking into samples during the observation.\n5. Observation\nNOTE: Appropriate imaging parameters (laser power, gain, binning, etc.) will differ for each microscope system and camera. Here, a widefield microscope equipped with a spinning disk confocal scanner and a digital CCD camera is used.\nSet the temperature control of the stage to 20 °C, or adjust the room temperature to 20 °C.\nPut the sample slide on the microscope stage. Use 100x (numerical aperture = 1.3 or better) objective lens.\nLook for the areas indicated in Figure 2A (for wyIs251 and axonal transport) or Figure 2B (for mnIs17 and IFT) as positive controls. Other areas can be analyzed as well22.\nSet parameters (CCD Gain = 200, Binning = 1 or 2, laser power at 488 nm = 1.0-1.3 mW). Perform time lapse recording at 4 frames/s for up to 1 min. Save files as mutli-TIFF format.\n\tNOTE: If GFP signals disappear and it is difficult to continue to observe GFP::RAB-3 or OSM-6::GFP for 30 s, the laser power is too strong. In that case, reduce the laser power. Conversely, if no vesicular movement is recorded, the laser power is too weak. In that case, increase the laser power.\nObserve a different worm and repeat 5.3 and 5.4. The observations can last for up to 20 min, but each worm should be recorded only once to avoid the effects of photo damage.",
    "NOTE: Worms have been observed for at least 20 min without significant defects7,27,28. Longer observation may be possible but haven't been tested yet. A clear sign of neuronal death is the change of neuronal morphology such as neurite swelling. As weak GFP signals can be seen in axons and dendrites in both wyIs251 and mnIs17, neurite morphology can be easily checked by just looking at axons or dendrites. Neuronal morphology is shown in Figure 2.\nGenerate movie files.\nOpen the multi-TIFF file using Fiji software. Go to File>Open then select the multi-TIFF file saved in step 5.4.\n\t\tNOTE: Fiji can be downloaded at jttps://fiji.sc. Image J and plugins can also be used to generate kymographs. If doing so, follow the relevant instructions for the chosen plugin. \nClick the \"Rectangular selection\" button (Figure 3A, arrow) and select the area of interest by drawing a rectangle with a computer mouse (yellow rectangle in Figure 3A). Go to Image>Stacks>Tools>Make Substacks and select the slice numbers that are included in the movie. A substack is generated.\nActivate the substack window by clicking and go to Image>Adjust>Brightness/Contrast. A window to adjust the brightness and contrast shows up. In the window, slide the top bar (Minimum) to the right so that the background signal disappears and the second top bar (Maximum) to the left so that the moving vesicles and particles can be seen quite well over the background.\nGo to Image>Stacks>Time Stamper. As the movie is recorded at 4 frames/s in step 5.4, the time interval is 0.25 s. Thus, type \"0.25\" in Interval.\nGenerate a movie file by selecting Save as>AVI from the File menu (Movie 1 and 2).\n\t\tNOTE: By using appropriate plugins, you can save the file as other formats such as \"mpeg4\" or \"mov\" files.\nGenerate kymographs.",
    "Open the original movie files using FIji software again and repeat steps 5.6.2 and 5.6.3 to adjust the brightness and contrast.\nClick \"segmented line\" (Figure 3B, arrow). Using a mouse, draw a segmented line along the cilia or axon (yellow line, in Figure 3B).\nGo to Analyze>Multi Kymograph>Multi Kymograph (Figure 3C). Line width window appears (Figure 3D). Type \"3\" in the Linewidth window and Click OK (Figure 3D).\nKymograph window is created. Save the image in TIFF or JPEG format.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
