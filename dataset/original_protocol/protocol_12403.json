    "Note: All supplies are listed in Table 1.\n1. Storing the Chicken Embryos\nIncubate chicken eggs of the strain Gallus gallus horizontally at 37oC with approximately 40% humidity and turn eggs once or twice daily. Turning eggs is important to prevent the embryo from adhering to the eggshell.\nDo not to turn the egg in the 24 hr prior to setting up the culture as otherwise the embryo will be located ventral to the yolk mass and will be damaged on opening the egg in step 3. In addition, keep the eggs at 4oC degrees for no more than one week before incubation to “halt” development but this is not ideal.\n2. Staging Chicken Embryos\nStage the chicken embryos using the Hamburger and Hamilton12 staging table. The ideal stage for setting up the ex-ovo culturing is HH stage 19-20 (around 3- days of incubation) because this is shortly after the head turns at 53 hpf.\n\tNote: HH stage 19-20 is characterized by the following morphological traits: somites are extended into the majority of the tail, however the very end of the tail remains unsegmented, the tail bud is curled, the allantois is small and has limited vasculature, the leg-buds are larger than the wing-buds and the eyes are unpigmented or have a grayish hue.\n3. Removing the Embryo from the Shell\nBefore removing the embryo from the shell, spray the shell with 70% ethanol and allow it to dry. Do not turn the egg rapidly as this will damage the embryo.",
    "Being careful not to alter the orientation of the egg, carefully crack the egg on the lower side (i.e., the side that was ventral during incubation) and release the embryo into a sterile weigh boat (88 x 88 x 23 mm). Wipe down weigh boats with 70% ethanol. Inspect the embryo to ensure that the yolk sack is not damaged. If the yolk has broken, discard the embryo, as it will not survive.\nObserve the embryo to ensure that it is viable; the heart is beating, vasculature appears normal, and no obvious abnormalities are present. Ensure that the edges of the weigh boat are dry.\nUsing a pipette, drop 40 μl of penicillin/streptomycin (5,000 units penicillin, 5 mg streptomycin per ml) on top of the albumin to help prevent infection.\n4. Preparing the Humidity Chamber\nPlace a small stack of kim-wipes and/or an absorbent pad made of cotton in the bottom of a sterile plastic container (12 x 12 x 6 cm) wiped with 70% ethanol.\nAdd sterile, distilled water to moisten the kim-wipes and/or cotton (approximately 150 ml of water).\n5. Assembling the Ex Ovo Culture\nPlace the weigh boat containing the embryo on top of the moist padding. Then, place half of a square sterile petri-dish (9.5 x 9.5 cm) on top of the weigh boat to form a loose lid.\nCover the plastic container with its lid. Press down two corners of the lid, ensuring a partial seal that still allows for good airflow inside the chamber.\nCarefully place the setup into the 37oC incubator until desired stage.",
    "Place containers of water in the incubator to help control the humidity, if a controlled humidity incubator is unavailable. Sterilize all water in the humidity chambers and in the incubator and replenish as needed during the incubation period. 40% humidity is ideal.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
