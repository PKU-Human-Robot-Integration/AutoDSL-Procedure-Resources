    "This general protocol is designed to support application of the platform to a wide variety of studies; aspects specific to the representative study described in this report are separated out in brackets. Figure 2 illustrates a representative study carried out using the protocol. Note that in the protocol, all \"instruct\" commands are automated through use of pre-determined scripts. Note too that Step 2 can be carried out in parallel with Step 1 (e.g. during Steps 1.7 and 1.8), and that Step 2.1 is often bypassed (because patterned/coated DMF device plates can be washed and re-used; see Step 5.2).\n1. Assemble and Populate the Cell Perfusion Chambers\nCoat the interior surfaces of sterilized (autoclaved) microcapillaries (fused-silica; 679 μm o.d., 534 μm i.d; 15 cm long) with fibronectin, by instructing the syringe pump to draw a sterile fibronectin solution (30 μl of 50 μg/ml) into each microcapillary, incubating (37 °C for 2 hr), instructing the syringe pump to withdraw the solution, and letting the microcapillaries dry (room temperature (RT) for 6 hr).\nConnect each fibronectin-coated microcapillary (perfusion chamber) to polycarbonate tubing (500 μm o.d., 100 μm i.d.) and the tubing to the multi-port syringe pump, using CapTite fittings (6 perfusion chambers, 8-port syringe pump).\nUsing tape, secure the body of each perfusion chamber to a heat block set to desired temperature (37 °C).\nImmerse the open ends of the perfusion chambers in a reservoir (microcentifuge tube or microtiter plate well) containing cells (P388D.1 murine macrophages) suspended in fresh growth medium (RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 500 units/ml penicillin, 500 μg/ml streptomycin) at desired concentration (106 cells/ml).\nInstruct the syringe pump to draw cells (10 μl, 104 cells) into each perfusion chamber followed by enough air to move the liquid plug (~4.5 cm) to the section secured to the heat block.",
    "Allow the cells to adhere to the fibronectin-coated interior surfaces of the perfusion chambers (37 °C for 1 - 2 hr). In the meantime, transfer the open ends of the perfusion chambers from the cells reservoir to a new reservoir containing fresh growth medium.\nAfter the adherence period, instruct the syringe pump to send the liquid plugs (conditioned media and unattached cells) to waste, withdraw fresh medium (10 μl), and follow with enough air to position the new liquid plugs (fresh medium) over the adhered cells.\nContinue to carry out medium exchanges (i.e. repeat Step 1.7) at regular intervals (every 2 hr) until the cell populations are sufficiently equilibrated and expanded (16 - 24 hr of micro-scale culture generated populations of ~1,000 cells/chamber).\n2. Fabricate the DMF Device and Assemble the Hub Architecture\nAs described previously14,29, pattern the bottom plate of the DMF device with forty-six indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes (drivers of droplet actuation) by photolithography and etching, and coat with 5 μm of Parylene-C and 50 nm of Teflon-AF. Form the top plate of the DMF device by coating an unpatterned ITO glass substrate with Teflon-AF, as above.\nUsing metal compression frames, fix the DMF plates into a polymer cast14,30 with recesses that maintain a 400 μm spacing between the plates; this spacing, combined with the actuation electrode size (2.5 mm2), defines the droplet volume (2.5 μl per electrode). Note that DMF assembly can be accomplished by simpler means24.\nInsert Teflon-coated transfer microcapillaries (360 μm o.d., 100 μm i.d.; 3.5 - 4.0 cm long) into the space between the DMF plates, positioning each to extend to the edge of its cognate actuation electrode.\nTo the opposite end of each transfer microcapillary affix a CapTite fitting.",
    "Engage the electrical connectors to supply voltage to the ITO electrodes. Electrode activation sequences are automated through use of a computer-controlled electronic interface running pre-determined scripts.\nOptional: Move the assembled DMF hub onto the translational stage of a microscope (SZ-6145TR (Olympus, Japan)) equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (DCR-HC96 (Sony, Japan)) to facilitate tracking of droplets.31\n3. Connect the Perfusion Chambers to the DMF Hub and Stimulate the Cell Populations\nRemove the open ends of the perfusion chambers from the medium reservoir (see Step 1.6) and insert them into the CapTite fittings affixed to the ends of the transfer microcapillaries of the DMF hub (see Step 2.4).\nInstruct the syringe pump to send the liquid plugs (conditioned media) in the perfusion chambers to waste.\nInstruct the DMF hub to draw stimulus (E. coli BioParticles at 100 μg/ml in fresh medium with 0.1% Pluronic F127 w/v) from an on-board reservoir and deliver a droplet of appropriate size (10 μl) to each transfer microcapillary. The on-board reservoirs are comprised of cylindrical-shaped compartments (1.5 x 1.5 cm each) and connected to the DMF Hub via tubing.\nInstruct the syringe pump to draw the stimulus plugs into the transfer microcapillaries, and follow with enough air to position the plugs over the cell populations in the perfusion chambers.\nIncubate the cells with stimulus (37 °C for 1 - 4 hr). Optional: Exchange for fresh stimulus (i.e. repeat Steps 3.2-3.4) at regular intervals.\n4. Terminate Stimulation and Recover Cell Lysates for Analysis\nOptional: If a post-stimulation period is required, exchange the stimulus-containing liquid plugs for fresh medium (i.e. repeat Steps 3.2 - 3.4, substituting fresh medium for stimulus), and continue to incubate and exchange as needed.",
    "Exchange the liquid plugs in the perfusion chambers for wash buffer (Prelude Direct Lysis Module Buffer B) (i.e. repeat Steps 3.2 - 3.4, substituting wash buffer for stimulus), and incubate as needed (5 min).\nExchange the liquid plugs (wash buffer) for lysis solution (Prelude Direct Lysis Module Buffer A with 0.1% Pluronic F127 w/v) (i.e. repeat Steps 3.2 - 3.4, substituting lysis solution for stimulus), and incubate as needed (5 min).\nInstruct the syringe pump to send the liquid plugs (cell lysates) to the DMF hub.\nDisassemble the DMF hub, remove the top plate of the DMF device (using care not to tilt the plate sideways, as this can result in droplet mixing), and collect the lysates using a Pipetman or syringe for off-platform analysis (gene expression profiling via qPCR).\n5. Clean Platform Hardware for Re-use\nImmerse the transfer microcapillaries and CapTite fittings in 10% bleach (v/v in water) for 10 min at RT, rinse well with deionized water, and dry using nitrogen gas.\nImmerse the DMF device plates in 10% bleach for 10 min at RT, rinse well with isopropanol followed by deionized water, and dry using nitrogen gas followed by baking at 160 °C for 10 min.\nThe syringe pump's polycarbonate tubing, and the DMF device's polymer cast and compression frame, can be re-used without cleaning. The perfusion chamber microcapillaries are discarded after each experiment.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
