Leave tubes open and air-dry until no ethanol remains.\nThis may take 10 to 20 min. Do not allow the pellets to over dry.\n22. Once the pellet is dry, add 50 µl HPLC-grade water or 1× TE buffer.",
    "23. Flick tubes to dissolve the pellet and spin down.\n24. Quantify concentrated PCR products using a microvolume spectrophotometer.\nWe recommend using PCR products that are ≥20 ng/µl.\n25. Store concentrated PCR products at –20°C until further use.\nIf the samples amplified have a single FMR1 allele (e.g., hemizygous male or a homozygous female with two FMR1 alleles of identical CGG repeat size), proceed to clone.\nIf you are interested in cloning one of the two alleles of a sample from a heterozygous female, we recommend that you first resolve the alleles on an agarose gel and isolate the fragments of interest for cloning. To accomplish this, load the concentrated PCR products into a 2% (w/v) agarose gel prepared with 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide. Electrophorese the gel at 5 to 10 V/cm for 15 to 40 min, and locate and carefully cut out the gel bands with the desired templates. Then isolate and purify the fragments of interest using a gel band purification kit such as the illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nBefore you proceed with the cloning steps outlined below, thaw the DH5α competent cells on ice, and set the water bath to 42°C. Remove the S.O.C. medium from 4°C, and bring it to room temperature.\nBacterial transformation\n26. Prepare ligation reaction by adding 1 µl salt solution and 1 µl pCRII-TOPO TA vector to 4 µl of each concentrated PCR product (from step 24).\nThe remaining steps have been optimized for the Invitrogen TA Cloning Kit. You may need to modify some of the steps depending on the kit you use.\n27. Add ligation reaction to the thawed DH5α competent cells (50 µl per tube).\n28. Gently tap tubes to mix.\n29. Incubate cells on ice for 30 min.",
    "30. Immerse two-thirds of the tubes into the 42°C water bath, and heat shock cells for 20 s.\n31. Place tubes on ice for 2 min.\n32. Add 0.95 ml room temperature S.O.C. medium to each tube.\n33. Shake tubes at 225 rpm for 1 hr at 37°C.\n34. Centrifuge tubes 5 min at 16,060 × g, room temperature.\n35. Remove 800 µl supernatant and discard.\n36. Resuspend pellet in remaining supernatant.\nBacterial culture\n37. Using a sterile cell spreader, spread cells from each tube on individual, labeled LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin.\nIf prepoured LB agar plates are not available, you can prepare them. Dissolve 15 g Bacto agar in 1 L LB medium, and autoclave to sterilize. Cool agar to 50°C, and then add 1 ml of 100 mg/ml ampicillin before pouring into plates and letting plates rest to solidify and set. Store prepared LB agar plates at 4°C.\n38. Incubate plates overnight at 37°C.\n39. Randomly pick 10 to 20 colonies from each plate using clean pipette tips.\n40. Suspend each colony in an individual PCR tube containing 10 µl of 1× TE buffer, and mark colony numbers on the PCR tubes and LB plates.\n41. Set up dTP-PCR CE assay (as outlined in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.427#cpz1427-prot-0005]) with 1 µl picked colony from each PCR tube.\n42. Examine electropherograms to identify colonies that have the inserts with expected FMR1 CGG repeat size and structure.\n43. Create a starter culture by inoculating the remaining 9 µl colonies of interest into individual 15-ml tubes with 5 ml LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin.\n44. Shake tubes at 250 rpm overnight at 37°C.\n45. Expand culture by performing an overnight incubation at 37°C with 250 rpm in 50 to 100 ml LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin.",
    "46. Prepare glycerol stocks for future use by adding 400 µl culture to 400 µl glycerol and pipetting up and down gently to mix. Store glycerol stocks at –80°C.\nMix glycerol solution, and ensure it is uniform before using it to prepare the stocks.\nEnsure the stocks are labeled clearly, and avoid repeated freezing and thawing of the glycerol stocks to maintain viability of the bacterial cells.\nIsolation and quantification of plasmid DNAs\n47. Use the Qiagen Plasmid Mini or Axyprep Plasmid MiniPrep Kit to isolate plasmid DNA samples as per the manufacturer's instructions.\n48. Quantify extracted plasmid DNAs using a microvolume spectrophotometer, and store samples at –20°C.\n49. Use 1 pg extracted plasmid DNA as the template for dTP-PCR MCA (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.427#cpz1427-prot-0001]) or dTP-PCR CE (see Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.427#cpz1427-prot-0005]) assays.\nThe repeat size and structure of the plasmid DNA extracts can also be verified by Sanger sequencing (see Basic Protocol 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.427#cpz1427-prot-0007]).",
