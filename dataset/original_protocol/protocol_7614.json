    "Perform all protocol steps for live platelets at room temperature. Do not put platelets on ice. A Schematic overview of the experimental process is shown in the Graphical overview.Collection of human blood Draw 5 mL of venous blood into a 10 mL syringe with a 21 G syringe needle from a consenting adult donor. This should be performed by a competent phlebotomist.Remove the needle from the syringe and immediately and gently transfer blood into a round-bottom 10 mL centrifuge tube containing 1 mL of 3.2% sodium citrate (see Recipes).Mix blood with sodium citrate by gently inverting the tube three times.Collection of mouse blood Collect 75 μL of blood from the mouse dorsal pedal vein or another venous non-terminal collection site. For blood collection from the pedal vein, place the mouse into a restrainer and puncture the vein with a 23 G and 27 G syringe needle.Collect the blood by holding an EDTA/heparin-coated capillary tube to the puncture site. Pre-warming the mice using a heated gel pack greatly aids the identification of the pedal vein.Alternatively, collect 900 μL of blood by cardiac puncture under terminal anesthesia with a 23 G needle and 1 mL syringe. Remove the needle from the syringe and transfer blood immediately to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 100 μL of 3.2% sodium citrate.Production of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from whole blood Centrifuge whole blood at 350× g for 20 min at room temperature (RT) or 1,300× g for 10 min at 22 °C.The blood will have separated into two layers: the lower, dark layer of packed red blood cells and the upper yellow layer of PRP. The PRP volume will be approximately 50% of the whole blood volume.Carefully remove the upper PRP layer and transfer it to a new round-bottom centrifuge tube.",
    "PRP may be used directly in cytometry experiments. Further processing is required to generate washed platelet suspensions.Platelet separation and washing Wash platelets by diluting PRP (see Procedure C) with 5 volumes of the HBSS, supplemented with 4 mM EDTA, pH 6.4, or washing buffer (see Recipes).Centrifuge at 350× g for 20 min at RT or 1,300× g for 10 min at 22 °C.Wash the platelet pellet gently without resuspending it three times with HBSS (supplemented with 4 mM EDTA, pH 6.4) or wash buffer containing 0.25 μM PGE1.Washed platelets can be resuspended directly into DMEM complete media (see Recipes) or resuspension buffer (see Recipes) suitable for the experiment.Count platelets using a coulter counter.Stain the washed platelets (8 × 105 cells/mL) with CellTrackerTM Green dye (see section E3 below) and readjust the required concentration in resuspension buffer or directly into DMEM complete media (see Recipes).Examination of platelets and tumor cell interactions by confocal microscopy Cell revival and maintenanceRecover MDA-MB-231-RFP or other tumor cells from liquid nitrogen and dip the lower half of the vial into the 37 °C water bath or bead bath to thaw.Do not let the whole content of the vial completely thaw (a small piece of ice should be visible inside the vial), wipe the vial from outside with 70% ethanol, and move to a laminar flow cell culture hood.Open the vial and add contents into a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing pre-warmed complete media.Centrifuge the 15 mL centrifuge tube containing cell and DMEM complete media (see Recipes) at 250× g for 5 min at RT.After centrifugation, wipe the outside of the 15 mL centrifugation tube with 70% ethanol, move to a laminar flow cell culture hood, and decant the media in the liquid discarder without disturbing the cell pellet.",
    "Pipette out the 1 mL fresh DMEM complete media (see Recipes) in the 15 mL centrifuge tube containing the cell pellet and resuspend the cells by slowly inverting the tube. Disperse the cells in a 100 mm dish plate containing 10 mL OF DMEM complete media (see Recipes) and keep the cultured dish plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified cell culture incubator.Replace the media with fresh DMEM complete media every 2–3 days.Seeding cells into collagen-coated 35 mm dish cover glassOnce the cells reach 80%–90% confluency, remove the media from a 100 mm dish by aspiration.Wash cells with 2–4 mL of DPBS (Ca2+/Mg2+ free) and remove the solution by aspiration.Pipette 2–4 mL of pre-warmed 0.05% Trypsin solution into the 100 mm dish and incubate the dish in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified cell culture incubator for 5 min.Swirl the dish to ensure the solution covers all cells.Observe the trypsinization process under the microscope at RT.Once cells are suspended, pipette 6 mL of DMEM complete media to the flask to inhibit trypsin activity.Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 250× g for 5 min to pellet the cells.Aspirate the media from the tube without disturbing the cell pellet.Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of complete medium by gently pipetting the cells up and down and count the cells using a cell counting chamber.Seed cells (4 × 104 cells/dish) immediately into the 35 mm collagen-treated cover glass plates or 48-well glass bottom plates (clear-culture plates) at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells/well in 500 μL of DMEM complete media (see Recipes).",
    "Following the addition of cells, swirl the media in the dish to distribute the cells and place the 35 mm collagen-treated cover glass and 48-well glass bottom plates in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified cell culture incubator.Platelet stainingFluorescently label the isolated platelets using CellTrackerTM Green according to the manufacturer’s protocol with slight modifications. Platelets isolated at a concentration of 8 × 105 cells/mL were reconstituted in resuspension buffer.Prepare the CellTrackerTM Green stock solution (1 mM) by adding the 20 μL of DMSO to a vial containing 50 μg of CellTrackerTM Green.Prepare the working CellTrackerTM Green solution to 2 μM by diluting it in 1× PBS.Add 200 μL of working CellTrackerTM Green solution (2 μM) to 1 mL of platelet suspension.Immediately mix the sample by gentle pipetting and incubate the sample for 10 min at 37 °C.After incubation, centrifuge the sample at 350× g for 20 min at RT.Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with warm PBS or washing buffer thrice by resuspending the pellet in PBS/washing buffer before centrifugation during each wash and after centrifugation. PBS should be discarded without disturbing the pellet.Resuspend the platelets pellet (6 × 106/100 μL) in the resuspension buffer for treatment.Treatment with agonist and antagonistAfter the labeling, activate the platelets by incubation with an agonist (U46619, 0.3 μM in PBS) and/or antagonist (Ifetroban, 10 μM in PBS) (Table 1).Table 1.

PBS should be discarded without disturbing the pellet.Resuspend the platelets pellet (6 × 106/100 μL) in the resuspension buffer or cell culture media (DMEM complete media, see Recipe) for treatment.Treatment and confocal examinationObserve cell growth in 35 mm collagen-treated cover glass (see step E2k). If the cells are confluent (80%–90%), then add the agonist- or antagonist-treated CellTrackerTM Green-labeled platelets (6 × 106 in 100 μL of DMEM complete media or PBS) (see step E4e).Incubate the cultures in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified cell culture incubator for another 30 min.Wash the cells thrice with warm PBS to remove unbound platelets.Fix the cells with 2% paraformaldehyde (diluted from 16% paraformaldehyde) in PBS for 15 min in a dark room.Gently wash the cells twice with warm PBS.Add 0.5 mL of mounting media with DAPI to fix cells and either examine immediately under confocal microscopy or store the slides at 4 °C until further analysis.Platelet quantification by microplate reader analysisRepeat steps E5a–E5c.Lyse platelets bound to tumor cells (see step E5c) with 200 μL of Triton X-100 (10% in PBS) agitated for 5 min.Transfer cell lysates to black 96-well plates and measure the fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 525 nm, respectively, using a microplate reader. Use at least triplicate samples to quantify platelet levels."
