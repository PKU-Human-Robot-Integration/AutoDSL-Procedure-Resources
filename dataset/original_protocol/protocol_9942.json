    "NOTE: Illustration of the complete synthetic cells’ production protocol is presented in Figure 1. According to the user’s needs, the protein expression (section 3.2) and synthetic cell formation (section 4) parts of the protocol can also be carried out independently (with some adaptations).\n1. Preparation of S30-T7 lysate\nStreak plate the E. coli BL21(DE3) bacteria transformed with the T7 RNA polymerase expressing pAR1219 plasmid on a LB-agar plate supplemented with 50 µg/mL ampicillin to obtain single colonies.\nPrepare a starter solution: Inoculate a single colony into 5 mL of LB-media supplemented with 50 µg/mL ampicillin in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask and grow overnight using a floor incubator shaker at 250 rpm and 37 °C. Prepare duplicates.\nInoculate each 5 mL starter separately into 500 mL of TB media supplemented with 50 µg/mL ampicillin in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask with baffles and grow it using a floor incubator shaker at 250 rpm and 37 °C until it reaches OD600 of 0.8-1. Monitor periodically using a spectrophotometer.\nAdd 2-3 mL of 100 mM stock of IPTG (to reach 0.4 - 0.6 mM) for induction of T7 RNA polymerase expression and continue growing the culture until it reaches OD600≈4.\nTransfer the solution from each Erlenmeyer flask into two 250 mL sterilized centrifuge tubes.\nCentrifuge each at 7,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: At this stage, the bacterial pellet can be stored at -20 °C for a few days before moving on to the next steps.\nRe-suspend each pellet in 250 mL of cold (4 °C) S30 lysate buffer and centrifuge at 7,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: The S30 lysate buffer is used for maintaining protein stability after cell lysis is performed using the homogenizer in step 1.9. From this step forward, all steps until 1.12 should be carried out consecutively and rapidly.\n\tNOTE: Before proceeding to the next step, pre-cool the tips and 1.5-milliliter vials that will be needed for storing the lysate\nDiscard the supernatant and re-suspend all pellets together in 15 mL of cold S30 lysate buffer. Filter the suspension using gauze pad.\n\tNOTE: 15ml of solution is due to homogenizer min. volume. Should be noticed that bacteria concentration is also important.\nHomogenize at a working pressure of 15,000 psi, with an air pressure of 4 bar (two passes) for cell breakage. Avoid solution dilution for a more concentrated and active lysate.\nAdd 100 μL of 0.1 M DTT (CAUTION) per 10 mL of the homogenized suspension.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 24,700 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.\nPerform the following step quickly for preserving the lysate activity: divide the supernatant one-by-one into 200 μL aliquots in precooled 1.5 mL vials and immediately snap freeze them with liquid nitrogen. Store at -80 °C for further use. \n\tCAUTION: DTT is classified as Irritant and Harmful and should therefore be treated with care.\n2. Preparation of lipids in oil solution\nDissolve POPC and cholesterol in chloroform (CAUTION) separately, each to a final concentration of 100 mg/mL. Vortex each vial separately.\n\t\nCombine the components in a 2mL glass vial: add 50 µL of POPC in chloroform, 50 µL of cholesterol in chloroform and 500 µL of mineral oil. For 100 µL of synthetic cells, 2 vials of lipids in oil are required.",
    "Vortex, and then heat for about 1 h at 80 °C in a chemical hood to evaporate the chloroform. Ensure that complete evaporation has occurred by following the specified time/conditions and monitoring the solution volume.\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting lipid-in-oil solution can be stored at room temperature for up to two weeks. For improved results, it is recommended to use a fresh preparation before each experiment. Lipid and cholesterol ratios can be altered according to the desired membrane composition. A high concentration of cholesterol can lead to the formation of aggregates in the final synthetic cell solution.\n\t\tCAUTION: Chloroform is classified as Irritant and Harmful and should therefore be treated with care and in areas with fume extraction.\n3. Preparations of outer, pre-inner and feeding solutions\nPreparation of stock solutions\n\t\nPrepare the stock solutions listed in Table 2 using ultrapure water (UPW).\n\t\tNOTE: Stock solutions should be prepared in advance and stored at -20 °C until further usage. Reagent 7 tends to form aggregates. Heating to 37 °C will reduce the aggregation. Slight aggregation will not affect the reaction significantly. Reagent 8 solution is milky and turbid.\nOuter solution\n\t\nDissolve glucose in DNase/RNase-free H2O to a final concentration of 200 mM.\nFor 100 µL of inner solution, prepare 1.6 mL of outer solution.\nPre-inner solution\n\t\nAdd reagents 1-14 according to the amounts and concentration listed in Table 2. For example, for a final synthetic cell volume of 100 µL, prepare 100 µL of inner solution.\n\t\tNOTE: UPW should be added to complete the final required volume. At this stage, the mixture can be stored at 4 °C for a few hours.\nFeeding solution\n\t\nAdd all the reagents according to the amounts and concentration listed in Table 3.",
    "NOTE: Use 1:1 ratio of feeding solution:inner solution. For a final synthetic cell volume of 100 µL, prepare 100 µL of feeding solution. It is recommended to prepare a small excess volume of outer, inner and feeding solution.\n4. Preparation of synthetic cells\nNOTE: The following volumes are adjusted for the preparation of 100 µL of synthetic cells.\nSynthetic cells producing protein\n\t\nIn a 15 mL tube, place 12 mL of the outer solution and slowly add, on top a layer, of 500 µL of lipids in oil solution. Incubate at room temperature for 20 min.\nTo finalize the inner solution preparation: mix the inner solution ingredients on crushed ice to a final volume of 100 µL by thawing and adding S30-T7 Lysate (reagent 15) and DNA plasmid (reagent 16) to the stored mixture.\nTo the second 2 mL glass vial with 500 µL of lipids in oil solution, add 100 µL of the inner solution. Pipette up and down vigorously for 1 minute and vortex for another minute on level five.\n\t\t\nIncubate for 10 min on crushed ice and slowly add the resulted emulsion on top of the oil phase in the 15 mL tube (from 4.1.1).\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 100 x g and 4 °C and then centrifuge for 10 min at 400 x g and 4 °C. By the end of the centrifugation, a pellet at the bottom of the tube should be observed.\n\t\tNOTE: Using a swinging bucket centrifuge rotor is preferred here for acquiring a better coverage of a second layer of lipids during the water-in-oil droplets’ passage through the interphase. In case there is no observable pellet, centrifugation speed can be increased to 1000 x g. Otherwise, see the Discussion section referring to the specific gravity of the outer solution.",
    "Extract the pellet.\n\t\t\nRemove excess oil layer.\nUse a trimmed pipette tip loaded with approximately 400 µL of outer solution to extract the pellet. Release the outer solution while passing through the oil phase in order to collect only the pellet in the aqueous phase.\n\t\t\t\nWipe the tip after the extraction of the pellet to avoid transferring oil remains and transfer the pellet to a clean 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 1,000 x g and 4 °C, remove the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 100 µL of feeding solution (1:1 ratio of inner:feeding solutions).\n\t\tNOTE: A fixed angle centrifuge rotor may be used here as well.\nFor protein expression, incubate for 2 hours at 37 °C without shaking.\n\t\tNOTE: Optimal incubation time varies between different proteins.\nEvaluate the produced protein amount using a suitable method according to the target protein properties.\nRecommended control groups\n\t\nInner solution and lysate activity confirmation\n\t\t\nPrepare a complete inner solution (with DNA & S30-T7 lysate).\nImmediately incubate the reaction above using a floor incubator shaker at 250 rpm or a thermomixer at 1200 rpm, at a constant temperature of 37 °C for 2 h.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Adjust the incubation time to match the synthetic cells incubation time.\nSynthetic cells\n\t\t\nNegative control group: Prepare the protocol presented in 4.1 with inner solution without DNA.\nPositive control: Prepare the protocol presented in 4.1 with inner solution containing a T7 plasmid encoding for a reporter gene.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Add a positive control group comprised of a reporter gene, such as sfGFP, alongside the test groups to ensure the encapsulation efficiency step.\nSubscription Required.
