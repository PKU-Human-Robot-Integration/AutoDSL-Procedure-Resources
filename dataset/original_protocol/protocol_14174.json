    "This study was approved by the Central South University Ethics Committee for Animal Research from the Second Xiangya Hospital (Changsha, China). The manuscript was prepared according to ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines9.\n1. Material and Animal Preparation\nPrepare required materials: adhesive tape, epilating agent, 75% ethanol, blood collection tube, 2.5 mL syringe connected with needle (24 G, 0.6 mm x 25 mm), hair shaver, electronic scale, and gauge (see Table of Materials).\nUse 20 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, aged 8-10 weeks and weighing 153-200 g (see Table of Materials). Maintain rats in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals10.\nHouse rats under standard conditions with free access to food and drinking water. Keep them in 530 cm2 cages with wood-shaving bedding (2 rats per cage). Maintain animals in a temperature-controlled room temperature at around 25 °C.\nInduce general anesthesia (sodium pentobarbital 40 mg/kg) in all animals through intraperitoneal injection before the subclavian vein puncture.\nPlace the rat in a supine position. Fix the hind limbs in a comfortable position and fix the upper limb parallel to the body axis just beside the trunk.\n\tNOTE: No mechanical ventilation is needed for this procedure (Figure 1).\nClean both sides of the infraclavicular space to remove fur (with hair shaver and epilating agent, see Table of Materials) and any visible dirt. Wipe the neck and thoracic skin with 75% ethanol. Keep the area for puncture clean and dry with gauze.\n2. Blood Collection Procedure",
    "NOTE: Both sides of the subclavian vein are suitable for puncture, and here we choose the right side for puncture. The location and direction of the right clavicle are identified by the operator's left thumb (Figure 2). The suprasternal fossae are gently touched with the index finger as the suprasternal fossae is in the direction of the needle (Figure 2).\nRinse a sterile 2.5 mL syringe with heparin solution (10 IU/mL).\nLocate the puncture site 0.5 mm caudal to the outer 1/3 region of the right clavicle (Figure 3). Move the syringe gently into the skin of the puncture site. Once the needle enters the infraclavicular skin, apply negative pressure with the operator's right hand (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: The average and maximal blood volume are 1.0 mL and 1.4 mL, respectively. The direction of the needle is positioned toward the suprasternal fossae and should be almost parallel to the clavicle just posterior to it. Usually, the subclavian vein can be reached by inserting the needle about 2 mm in this direction. Once the needle enters the vein, blood will enter the syringe under negative pressure.\n\t\nMaintain negative pressure until enough volume of blood is drawn (Figure 5).\nIf the subclavian vein blood collection is not successful, withdraw the needle to the subcutaneous area and adjust the direction of the needle slightly interior to the sternum.\n\t\nIf three attempts fail, avoid the subclavian vein from the same side and use the contralateral side for blood sampling.\nAfter blood collection, remove the puncture needle, and apply pressure to the puncture site for 1-2 minutes to stop bleeding.\n\tNOTE: The pressure must be very gentle to prevent choking.\n3. Blood Sample Processing",
    "Transfer the blood sample into an anticoagulant-coated vacuum tube (with EDTA) and centrifuge for 10 min at 1600 x g to collect plasma.\nAspirate the supernatant to a clean tube and store at -80 °C (Figure 6).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
