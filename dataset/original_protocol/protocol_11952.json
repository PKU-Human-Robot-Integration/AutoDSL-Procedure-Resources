    "All of the experiments were performed in accordance with the 1994 Israeli guidelines for animal welfare. Bovine sperm was supplied by commercial Israeli company for artificial insemination and breeding. Ejaculates of 11 bulls were evaluated in this study.\n1. Sperm Sample Preparation\nNOTE: The procedure is based on the Roth laboratory's protocol1,3.\nObtain approximately 1–6 mL of bull semen in a 15 mL tube at room temperature.\nTo each 1 mL of semen, add 6 mL of prewarmed (at 37 °C) NKM buffer (110 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM MOPS [3-N-morphilino propanesulfonic acid; pH 7.4]) and centrifuge for 8 min at 600 x g, 1–2 times until the supernatant is clear.\nNOTE: If sperm concentration or the initial volume are very high, split into two tubes at the first wash.\nImmediately remove and discard the clear supernatant and leave approximately 1 cm of the supernatant above the pellet.\nCarefully lean the tubes at a 30° angle to increase the surface area for sperm to swim up and wait 20–30 min to allow spermatozoa to swim up at 37 °C.\nNOTE: Turbidity can be seen.\nUsing a micropipette carefully, remove the upper 1 mL of the supernatant containing the motile spermatozoa to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nKeep the sperm at 37 °C until use.\nEstimate the sperm count using a Neubauer hemocytometer.\nNOTE: A different counting chamber can be used instead, but the counting is different.\n\t\nTo prevent spermatozoon movement, dilute 100 µL of the motile spermatozoa with 10 mL of double distilled water (DDW) (1:100 dilution) in a 15 mL tube and mix gently.\nLoad 10 µL of the sample into each side of the hemocytometer and coverslip. Make sure to avoid bubble formation inside the chamber as this may result in an inaccurate sperm count.",
    "Observe under a compound microscope with a 20X objective.\nNOTE: The full grid on a hemocytometer contains 9 large squares, each 1 mm2, and the coverglass rests 0.1 mm above the floor of the chamber. Thus, the volume over the central counting area is 0.1 mm3 or 0.1 µL. The central area of the hemocytometer contains 25 medium squares and each medium square has 16 smaller squares with single lines.\nCount the total number of cells found in 4 medium corner squares and the central square. For higher precision, count two chambers (both sides of the Neubauer hemocytometer) and use the average to calculate cell concentration.\nCalculate the sperm count by multiplying the mean number obtained by 5 (to obtain the number of cells per counting area) and by 10,000 (to obtain the number of cells per 1 mL of diluted sample). Then multiply the obtained count by the dilution factor (1:100).\nNOTE: For example, an average number of sperm counted in 5 of the 25 medium squares within the central counting area of two chambers is 150 ([152+148]/2). Thus, the mean number of sperms per chamber (or per 0.1 µL) is 150 x 5 = 750. Multiply 750 by 10,000 to obtain the number of cells per 1 mL of diluted sample (7,500,000) and then multiply by 100 (dilution factor) to obtain 75 x 107 cells per mL of original semen sample.\n2. Technique #1: Simultaneous Assessment of Sperm Membranes Using Multiple Fluorescent Probes\nNOTE: Sperm membranes (plasma, acrosomal and mitochondrial) were assessed as previously described by Celeghini et al.10, with some modifications. Epifluorescent microscopy was used, combined with a digital camera with excitation at 450-490 nm and emission at 515-565 nm using a triple filter.\nPrepare stock solutions.",
    "Prepare 0.1 mg/mL DAPI stock solution by dissolving 5 mg of DAPI in 50 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Prepare 50 µL aliquots and store at -20 °C. Before use, dilute the stock solution with PBS at 1:10 (working solution; 10 µg/mL).\nPrepare 1 mg/mL FITC–PSA stock solution by dissolving 1 mg of FITC–PSA in 1 mL of PBS. Prepare 50 µL aliquots and store at -20 °C. Before use, dilute the stock solution with PBS at 1:10 (working solution; 100 µg/mL).\nPrepare 1 mg/mL JC-1 stock solution by dissolving 1 mg of JC-1 in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Prepare 10 µL aliquots and store at -20 °C. Before use, dilute the stock solution with DMSO at 1:10 (working solution; 0.1 mg/mL).\nPrepare the PI stock solution by dissolving 10 mg of PI in 400 µL of PBS (giving 2.5 mg/mL). Store at +4 °C. Dilute stock 1 with PBS at 1:20 (working solution; 0.125 mg/mL). Store at +4 °C as a stock solution.\n\t\tCaution: PI is a potential mutagen and should be handled with care. The dye must be disposed of safely and in accordance with applicable local regulations.\nTransfer 133 µL of the motile spermatozoa (step 1.5) to a new 1.5 mL tube (25 x 106 sperm/mL).\nNOTE: If the sample concentration is higher, dilute it in NKM buffer to achieve the required concentration; if the sample concentration of the swim up sample is lower, centrifuge the obtained supernatant after swimming up at 1,000 x g for 5 min, remove 0.5 mL of the supernatant and count the sperm again.\nAdd 17 µL of DAPI (working solution) and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.",
    "To the pellet, add 100 µL of NKM buffer.\nAdd 50 µL of FITC–PSA, 2 µL of JC-1 and 3 µL of PI (working solutions) and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nTo the pellet, add 40 µL of NKM buffer and resuspend by pipetting.\nTransfer 10 µL of the sample to a glass slide, smear and coverslip.\nVisualize immediately by epifluorescence microscopy (use 40x objective) with a triple filter, equipped with a digital camera and capture an image separately for each filter.\nNOTE: There is no significance to the order of filters visualized.\n\t\nVisualize under DAPI channel with excitation at 358 nm and emission at 461 nm.\nVisualize under FITC channel for green monomers with excitation at 450–490 nm and emission at 515–565 nm.\nVisualize under PI channel for red aggregates with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 590 nm.\nVisualize under JC-1 red aggregates with excitation at 559 nm, and emission in the range of 574–627 nm; JC-1 green monomers with excitation at 488 nm and emission in the range of 500–535 nm.\nMerge the three images received from the filters in JPG/JPEG format, using the \"merge\" option of the camera software.\nOpen the merged image with \"Paint\" tool and use the brush option to mark counted spermatozoa.\nClassify spermatozoa based on the fluorescence emitted from each probe:\nIn general evaluate at least 200 spermatozoa per slide—all cells appear blue (DAPI).\nEvaluate the viability by counting dead cells, which appear purple (PI [red] + DAPI [blue]) and calculate the percentage of dead cells (dead cells/total counted cells x 100).",
    "Evaluate acrosome status using the patterns of fluorescent staining (FITC–PSA). Calculate the percentages of the different patterns (intact, damaged or reacted acrosome cells/total counted cells x 100).\nNOTE: Damaged acrosomal membrane appears as a fully stained, green acrosome cap; reacted acrosomal membrane shows residual green equatorial or upper staining; cells containing intact acrosomal membrane will not exhibit any green staining of the acrosomal region.\nEvaluate ΔΨm by distinguishing spermatozoa with high ΔΨm, which exhibit a red-stained midpiece, and spermatozoa with low ΔΨm which exhibit a green-stained midpiece. Count red and green midpieces separately and calculate their ratio (red/green).\n3. Technique #2: Assessment of Sperm Membranes with Ready-To-Use Kits and Flow Cytometry\nNOTE: Assessment of plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential and acrosomal membrane integrity was performed with ready-to-use flow cytometry kits containing lyophilized fluorochromes in each well. The procedure was performed according to the manufacturers with some modifications.\nPlasma membrane integrity evaluation\nTake the desired number of wells from the package of viability and concentration kit (PI and SYbr14), transfer them to the working base and cover with a flexible lid (protect from light).\nAdd 199 µL of buffered solution for cytometry per well.\nAdd 1 µL of homogeneous semen at 57 x 106/mL (57,000 cells per well) and homogenize by pipetting.\nCover the plate with the black lid.\nIncubate for 10 min at 37 °C protected from light.\nRun the sample through the flow cytometer with the setting ‘viability’.\nMitochondrial membrane potential\nTake the desired number of wells from the package of mitochondrial activity kit (JC-1), transfer them to the working base and cover with a flexible lid (protect from light).\nAdd 10 µL of absolute ethanol per well and pipette to resuspend the powder present within the well.",
    "Add 190 µL of PBS per well and homogenize by pipetting.\nAdd 0.75 µL of homogeneous semen at 57 x 106/mL (50,000 cells per well) and homogenize by pipetting.\nCover the plate with the black lid.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C protected from light.\nRun the sample through the flow cytometer with the setting ʽmitochondrial activity’.\nAcrosomal membrane integrity\nNOTE: FITC–PSA staining (see Technique #1) enables the evaluation of 3 acrosome categories (intact acrosome, reacted acrosome and damaged acrosome). Using the flow cytometer and viability & acrosome integrity kit (PI and FITC–PNA), the spermatozoa are separated into these 3 categories.\n\t\nTake the desired number of wells from the package of viability & acrosome integrity kit, transfer them to the working base and cover with a flexible lid (protect from light).\nAdd 200 µL of buffered solution for cytometry per well.\nAdd 0.7 µL of homogeneous semen at 57 x 106/mL (40,000 cells per well) and homogenize by pipetting.\nCover the plate with the black lid.\nIncubate for 45 min at 37 °C protected from light.\nRun the sample through the flow cytometer with the setting ʽInCyte’.\nAnalyze the resultant histogram by gating three marker areas according to fluorescence intensity, representing negligible, low-fluorescing cells with intact, unstained acrosome (R1), low-fluorescing cells with residual stained part of the acrosome (R2) and highly fluorescing cells with disrupted acrosome (R3).\nNOTE: Use the \"analyzing files acquired using other modules\" section in the instrument user guide in order to create the three regions (R1, R2, R3).\n4. Technique #3: Assessment of Sperm Membranes Using Fluorescent Probes and Flow Cytometry\nNOTE: Use of annexin V combined with PI fluorochromes enables assessing apoptosis and calculating the proportion of apoptotic sperm (apoptotic index).",
    "Prepare 1x annexin V binding buffer from 20x stock solution (dilute 500 µL of annexin V binding buffer 20x stock solution with 9.5 mL of sterile distilled water).\nEstimate the sperm count using a Neubauer hemocytometer as described in section 1.7.\nWash 106 spermatozoa in 1 mL of 1x annexin V binding buffer and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min.\nAspirate the supernatant completely.\nResuspend the pellet in 100 µL of 1x annexin V binding buffer.\nAdd 10 µL of annexin V conjugated to FITC.\nMix well and incubate for 15 min in the dark at room temperature.\nWash spermatozoa by adding 1 mL of 1x annexin V binding buffer per 106 cells and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min.\nAspirate the supernatant completely.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of 1x annexin V binding buffer per 106 total cells.\nAdd 1 µg/mL PI immediately prior to analysis with a flow cytometer.\nRun the sample through the flow cytometer set on ʽInCyte’.\nSubscription Required.
