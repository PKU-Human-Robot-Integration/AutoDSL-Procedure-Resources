    "The animal procedures in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the West China School of Stomatology, Sichuan University (WCHSIRB-D-2017-041). Adult C57BL/6 mice were used in this study (see the Table of Materials). This protocol adds mechanical load to the right maxillary first molar (M1) for mesial movement where a highly coordinated bone remodeling process is induced by coupling of bone resorption and bone formation (Figure 1).\n1. Preoperative preparation\nSurgical items\n\t\nPrepare the following surgical items for the operation: surgical platform (Figure 2A), fastener (Figure 2B), surgical instruments (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S1), orthodontic supplies (Figure 2C), and dental restoration supplies (Figure 2D).\n\t\tNOTE: The customized coil spring is custom-made and provides a force of 10cN when stretched to 10 mm.\nSterilization\n\t\nSterilize the surgical instruments by autoclaving and all the surgical items with ultraviolet irradiation for at least 30 min.\nAnesthesia\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse by administering ketamine (100 mg/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.\nApply vet ointment to the eyes of the murine with a cotton stick to avoid eye dryness.\nProceed with the surgery only when the mouse does not respond when its toes are pinched with forceps.\n2. Surgical process\nSpread and tape the limbs of the anesthetized mouse in a supine position to the surgical platform using adhesive tape.\nPin a 27 G needle on either side above the head and another 27 G needle on either side below the axilla.\nWind a rubber band around the above two needles and the upper incisors and another one around another two needles and the lower incisors. Change the needle positions to control the degree of opening and the orientation of the mouth (Figure 3A).",
    "NOTE: For the orthodontic tooth movement operation, keep the mouth open to the maximum extent before the buccinator becomes completely tight. The tongue should be pulled towards the non-operative side to expose the surgical field and prevent ischemia.\nBend the 1.5 mm end of a 3 cm 304 stainless steel wire and push the bent end through the interproximate space between the M1 and the maxillary second molar (M2) from the buccal side with curved ophthalmic tweezers (Figure 3B). When the palatal end of the ligature wire is seen from the palatal side, pull it out up to about half of its length and pass it through one end of the customized coil spring.\nTie a square knot with the two ends of the ligature wire in the mesial direction of the maxillary M1 until the spring is firmly fixed to the tooth (Figure 3C). Subtract the excess wire.\nSimilarly, pierce a second 3 cm 304 stainless steel wire through the other end of the coil spring.\nClean and dry the incisors' surfaces with cotton balls. Apply adhesives on all those surfaces with cotton sticks and light-cure them.\nPush the second stainless steel wire through the interproximate space between the maxillary incisors and tie a slip knot in the labial direction (Figure 3D). Subtract the excess wire and make the rest of the wire lie close to the tooth surface.\nInject light-cured resin to cover the knot and incisors; light-cure the resin (Figure 3E).\n3. Postoperative management\nNOTE: As there is no wound or bleeding during the operation, additional postoperative analgesia is not provided.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on a 37 °C thermostatic electric blanket. When the murine regains consciousness with ambulation, return it to a separate housing cage.",
    "Due to the limited functioning of the incisors after the surgery, replace regular hard fodder with only a soft diet.\nCheck the orthodontic appliances every day. Perform an additional operation when the orthodontic appliances break or are loosened.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
