  "procedures": [
    "Mice were kept in accordance with the institutional guidelines regarding the care and use of laboratory animals and in accordance with National Animal Care Guidelines (European Commission directive 86/609/CEE; French decree no.87-848). All procedures were approved by the French national ethics committee.\n1. Isolation of Muscle Tissue\nSacrifice one adult 6 to 8-week-old mouse by cervical dislocation. Sterlise the limb by rinsing it with 70% ethanol and dissect the hind limb muscles (Gastrocnemius, Tibialis Anterior, Quadriceps) using fine point scissors and forceps.\n\tNOTE: One mouse should yield around 500 mg of tissue.\nMince the muscles in a 2 mL test tube containing 1 mL of ice-cold hypotonic buffer to a homogenous preparation of small (<2 - 3 mm3) pieces using fine scissors and leave the tube shaking on a bench top agitator at 4 °C for 5 - 10 min.\n2. Tissue Lysis\nNOTE: Please refer to Table 1 for all buffer compositions.\nTransfer the homogenate to a 14 mL round-bottom tube and resuspend in 5 mL cold hypotonic buffer (EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and PMSF).\nHomogenise the minced muscle tissue using a loose dounce (20 - 30 strokes within 3 min) or a mechanical tissue homogenizer for 15 - 30 s in round-bottom 14 mL tubes.\n\t\tNOTE: The efficiency of lysis can be assessed at this stage by light microscopy, and if required, additional disruption can be performed.\nTransfer the homogenate to 15 mL tubes and fill volume to 10 mL using cold hypotonic buffer. Fix the homogenate as described below before proceeding with the next mouse.\n3. Fixation\nAdd formaldehyde to 1% final concentration and shake for 10 min at room temperature.\nAdd glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M in each tube to stop fixation and shake for 5 - 10 min at room temperature.",
    "4. Nuclei Preparation\nNOTE: Please refer to Table 1 for all buffer compositions.\nHomogenise the fixed lysate using a loose dounce (5 - 10 strokes).\nTransfer to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain nuclei and cellular debris.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in fresh 5 mL hypotonic buffer. Filter the lysate through a 70 µm cell strainer into a 50 mL tube. Re-filter the filtrate through a 40 µm cell strainer.\nTransfer the filtrate to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4 °C to obtain the nuclear pellet.\n\tNOTE: At this stage, the nuclei can be immediately sonicated, or snap frozen as a dry pellet in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.\n5. Sonication\nAssess the volume of the nuclear pellet (around 50 µL for both mechanical and dounce homogenisation) and resuspend it in sonication buffer up to 3 to 4 times of packed nuclear volume and sonicate for 10 - 15 min at 4 °C using a sonicator.\n\tNOTE: The chromatin can be analysed immediately as described below (6) or frozen and stored at -80 °C.\n6. Assessing the Chromatin Fragment Size following Sonication\nNOTE: Please refer to Table 1 for all buffer compositions.\nTo de-crosslink, take 30 µL of chromatin in a 1.5 mL test tube and add 20 µL 5 M NaCl. Complete the volume to 500 µL and incubate at 65 °C overnight.",
    "The next day, perform a treatment with 1 µL proteinase K (20 mg/mL stock), 10 µL 2 M Tris pH 6.8, and 10 µL of 0.5 M EDTA for 1 h at 42 °C. Perform a phenol-chloroform/chloroform extraction and precipitate the DNA with 1 volume of sodium acetate (3 M) and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol for one h at -80 °C or overnight at -20 °C.\nPellet the DNA by centrifugation at 13,500 x g for 15 min. Decant the supernatant and wash the pellet thoroughly with cold 70% ethanol and centrifuge again for 5 min. Decant the supernatant and air-dry the pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in the original volume (30 µL) of TE buffer. Measure the DNA concentration in a spectrophotometer by absorbance at 260 nm/280 nm. Pipette 500 - 1,000 ng of DNA together with a DNA size ladder on separate lanes of a 1.5% agarose gel and perform electrophoresis to assess the fragment size of chromatin.\n\tNOTE: Fragment size should be between 200 - 500 base pairs, and there should be no detectable high molecular weight fragments corresponding to non- or poorly-fragmented DNA. If required, the chromatin solution (step 5) can be re-sonicated for a longer time and then re-analysed as described above until the optimum size is obtained.\n7. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)\nNOTE: Please refer to Table 1 for all buffer compositions.\nBlock the Protein G sepharose beads by aliquoting 1 mL of the 50% slurry in ethanol. Pellet the beads by centrifugation at 400 x g for 1 min in a benchtop centrifuge and wash with 1 mL of TE buffer centrifuge at 400 x g and repeat the wash.",
    "After the second centrifugation, re-suspend in 1 mL of ChIP dilution buffer with 25 µL of BSA (stock 20 mg/mL) and 20 µL yeast tRNA (stock 10 mg/mL). Block the beads for at least 2 h prior to use by rotation (40 - 60 rpm) at 4 °C.\nDilute 50 µg of chromatin (step 5) 8 to 10 times using ChIP dilution buffer. Add 50 µL of blocked bead slurry and incubate for 2 h rotating (40-60 rpm) at 4°C. Centrifuge at 400 x g at 4 °C to obtain pre-cleared chromatin and transfer it to a fresh tube.\nFor immunoprecipitation, add the appropriate amount of primary antibody (e.g., 1-2 µg per 10 µg of chromatin) and incubate overnight with rotation at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The optimal amount of antibody may be recommended by the supplier or can be determined empirically by performing ChIP-qPCR with different quantities of antibody until optimum enrichment is observed. Also Protein G sepharose may be replaced by Protein A sepharose depending on the subtype of antibody used.\nAdd the blocked beads the next day and incubate for 1 h with rotation (40 - 60 rpm) at 4 °C. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 20 - 30 s to pellet the beads, remove the supernatant, and start the ChIP washes.\nChIP washes: Perform the following washes with the buffers: once with Low Salt Buffer, and then twice with High Salt Buffer, twice with LiCl Buffer, and finally twice with TE Buffer.\nPerform each wash for 10 min with rotation (40 - 60 rpm) at 4 °C and pellet the beads between each wash by centrifugation at 400 x g for 20 - 30 s in a bench-top centrifuge.",
    "For elution, remove the last wash and resuspend the beads in 250 µL elution buffer (freshly prepared) for 15 min at room temperature while shaking.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g and collect the eluate in a fresh tube. Perform this step twice and then de-crosslink the eluate overnight with 20 µL NaCl 5 M and 1 µL RNase A (10 mg/mL), treat with proteinase K, and phenol-chloroform/chloroform extract as in Step 6.\nResuspend in 50 µL of TE buffer and use aliquots for ChIP-qPCR as per standard protocols15 to check the quality of the ChIP.\nSubscription Required.
