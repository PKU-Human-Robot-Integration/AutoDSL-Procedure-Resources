    "This experimental protocol involves human subjects. The procedure was approved by the Kunsan National University Research Board.\n1. Preparation of equipment\nNOTE: The equipment includes the following: a personal computer (PC, 3.3 GHz with 8 GM) with a mouse, keyboard, and monitor; Walking Simulator software installed on the desktop PC; a customized treadmill (width: 0.67 m, length: 1.26 m, height: 1.10 m) equipped with handrails, a belt, and a magnetic encoder with a USB cable; and an Oculus Rift virtual reality device (DK1, U.S., 1280 x 800 pixels). The equipment also includes a customized manual treadmill. The treadmill turns via the walking motions of the participants and does not use an internal motor.\nPrepare sufficient space for the treadmill and a nearby desk for the PC. A photograph of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1A.\nConnect the equipment as shown in Figure 2.\n\t\nConnect treadmill’s magnetic encoder to the PC via a USB port.\nConnect the treadmill to a power source.\nConnect the headset to the PC via DVI/HDMI and USB ports.\n2. Preparation of walking simulator configurations\nAccess the walking simulator directory on the PC and open the “Config” directory.\n\tNOTE: Each configuration is saved as a text file in the “Config” directory with file names of “config001”, “config002”, etc. Here, 001, 002, etc. are the configuration numbers. Steps 2.2–2.8 describe how to create the configuration files so that they are readable by the simulator software. A schematic of a two-vehicle crossing situation showing customizable initial distances is shown in Figure 3. An example configuration file with proper formatting is shown in Figure 4. Section headings of the configuration file use square brackets (e.g., “[WALKER]”).\nComplete the section [WALKER] containing the parameter regarding the starting point of the participants.",
    "Set the parameter “Distance”, which indicates the starting distance of the participant from the starting point in meters (m).\nComplete the section [CAR] containing parameters regarding the first vehicle.\n\t\nSet the parameter “Type” (which indicates the type of vehicle) to “1” for sedan, “2” for bus, or “0” to remove the vehicle.\nSet the parameter “Speed” (which indicates the vehicle speed) to the desired value in km/h.\nSet the parameter “Distance” (which indicates initial distance of the vehicle from the crossing point) to the desired value in meters.\nComplete the section [SECONDCAR] containing the parameters related to the second vehicle. Parameters are identical to those of [CAR].\n\tNOTE: In two-vehicle studies, the gap is defined as the empty space between the two vehicles. The gap size, defined as the length of time during which the gap is along the participant’s walking path, is a function of the “Distance”, “Speed”, and “Type” parameters of [CAR] and [SECONDCAR].\nComplete the section [NEXTCAR] containing parameters related to additional vehicles. The parameters are identical to those of [CAR].\n\tNOTE: This option can be used to investigate pedestrian behavior within continuous traffic flow. This option is not discussed in the representative results section.\nComplete the section [ROAD], containing the parameter for lane selection. Set the parameter “lane” to “1” to use the lane closer to pedestrian’s starting position, or “2” for the lane further away. [OBSTACLE] indicates the parameters that configure a vehicle traveling in the second lane at the same speed as the first vehicle.",
    "NOTE: When using the closer lane as the primary lane, this option can be used to place additional vehicles on the farther lane going in the same direction. Hence, it can be used to study the impedance of the view of a vehicle by a parallel vehicle. This section has parameters “Type” and “Distance” with the same definitions described above. This option is not discussed in the representative results section. All results shown involve two vehicles driving in the lane closer to the pedestrian.\nComplete the section [SAVE], which contains the parameter related to sampling frequency. Set the parameter “numberpersecond” to the desired value in Hz.\nSave the configuration file and exit.\nRepeat sections 2.2–2.8 for all desired configurations and prepare data sheets with the list of configurations (in a randomized order) to be used in the experiment.\nPrepare three configuration files to be used in the practice trials.\n\tNOTE: The first practice configuration should have no vehicles (i.e., all “Type” parameters set to “0”). The second and third practice configuration files should have vehicles. The third configuration should have lenient crossing conditions. The same configuration may be used for the second and third practice trials, depending on the experimental design.\n3. Participation screening and preparation\nRecruit participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\n\tNOTE: All participants should be free of any conditions that prevent normal walking. They should be free of any dizziness while walking, and they should not have any history of serious traffic accidents.\nAsk the participant to sign a written, informed consent form before each experiment.\nPrepare an audio recording with verbal instructions of the task and play the recording to the participant.\n\tNOTE: The verbal instructions should narrate the basic procedure described below and give any specific prompts required by the experimental design.",
    "Encourage the participant to ask any questions about the experiment.\nLead the participant to stand on the treadmill when ready.\nHarness the stabilizing belt to the participant’s waist. Instruct the participant to hold the handrails at all times during the experiment.\n4. Running the practice trials\nInstruct the participant to practice walking on the treadmill, with the belt on, while holding the handrails.\nBegin the walking simulator program by double-clicking the executable simulator program once the participant is able to walk on the treadmill comfortably.\n\tNOTE: The black and white cartoon crosswalk shown in Figure 1B is displayed between crossing trials. At this point, it should be shown on the PC screen.\nInstruct the participant to wear the headset. Give assistance as needed. Check for both comfort and stability with respect to head turns.\nCalibrate the headset so that the black and white cartoon crosswalk is properly aligned with participant’s view.\n\tNOTE: Sections 4.5–4.7 describe three practice trials, which are designed to gradually allow the participant to become accustomed to the simulator environment. If the participant fails any trial due to misunderstanding of the instructions, up to two more extra trials should be performed until the participant understands the instructions. Extra trials are not performed in cases of failure to cross for reasons other than misunderstanding the rules (e.g., if a collision occurs).\nBegin the first practice trial.\n\tNOTE: The first practice trial should be without any vehicles for the participant to become accustomed to walking in the virtual reality setting.\n\t\nInform the participant that the first practice trial will occur without any vehicles.\nInstruct the participant to look straight ahead.\nEnter the first practice trial’s configuration number in the text box on the bottom of the screen.\nClick the “Start” button at the bottom of the screen.",
    "NOTE: The program should display the realistic setting depicted in Figure 1C on the screen.\nInform the participant to get ready when hearing “Ready” and to begin walking when hearing “Go”. Give the verbal cues “Ready” and “Go”.\nSecond practice trial\n\tNOTE: The second practice trial should introduce the vehicles without walking. The direction of the virtual reality view shifts as the participant’s head is turned.\n\t\nInstruct the participant in this trial, at the verbal cue “Go”, to look to the left and simultaneously take a small step forward, but not to walk forward any further. The participant should instead watch the vehicles pass by.\nType the second trial’s configuration number into the text box and click “Start” by providing the verbal cues.\n\t\tNOTE: The vehicles begin moving as the participant begins moving.\nThird practice trial\n\tNOTE: The third practice trial should be similar to the experimental configurations, but with lenient crossing conditions.\n\t\nInform the participant that 1) the third practice trial will involve two vehicles coming from the left side, and 2) he/she should attempt to cross the road between the two vehicles.\nEnter the third practice trial number in the text box by providing the verbal cue.\nClick the “Start” button and begin the trial by providing the verbal cues.\n5. Virtual walking experiment\nConfirm that the participant understands the experimental task and is able to perform it.\nWhen the participant is ready, type in the first configuration number from the data sheet on the text box and click “Start”.\nPerform the simulation as done in the final practice trial.",
    "NOTE: At the end of each crossing trial, the program displays “S”, “F”, or “C”, depending on whether the result is a successful crossing (i.e., the participant crosses to the other side of the street with no collisions), no crossing (participant does not cross to the other side), or a collision (participant has contact with a vehicle), respectively.\nRecord the result next to the configuration number on the data sheet.\nRepeat for all configurations on the data sheet and complete the experiment.\n6. Data export and analysis\nRetrieve the data files for analysis. The walking simulator software saves each run as a spreadsheet file in the “Data” folder.\nAnalyze data with the preferred tools. The output data records the positions and velocities of the walker and the vehicles as a time series. Use this data to analyze participant movements and the dependence on traffic conditions.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
