    "All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Regulations for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (311/1997, Ministry of Agriculture, Czech Republic), which is in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Isolation of Hepatic Microsomal and Cytosolic Fractions\nPrepare liver subcellular fractions (microsomes rich in P450 enzymes or cytosols rich in reductases or soluble peroxidases) from rats by simple differential centrifugation (105,000 x g).\n\tNOTE: The pellet and supernatant are taken as microsomes and cytosols, respectively.\n\t\nWash the liver samples (1-10 g) twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 containing 150 mM KCl buffer (buffer 1) (10-times higher volumes than weight of the tissue, i.e. 10-100 mL) and cut the tissues into small pieces (of around the 2 x 2 mm size).\nHomogenize the tissue in the presence of this buffer (>3 volume/weight mL/g) in homogenizer at 4 °C for 5 min, and discard the residual non-homogenized pieces of the tissue by filtration using filter paper. Centrifuge the homogenate at 600 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant to another centrifugation tube.\nRe-homogenize the pellet in buffer 1 (1 mL per 1 g of tissue), repeat step 1.1.3., and discard the pellet. Centrifuge pooled supernatants at 15,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to another centrifugation tube.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 105,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C. Collect the supernatant (cytosol) and store it in aliquots (1 - 10 mL) at -80 °C. Characterize cytosol for the amount of protein using the method described by Bradford26.",
    "Re-suspend the pellet in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (>2 volume/weight mL/g), centrifuge at 105,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant. Re-homogenize the pellet (microsomes) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 containing 150 mM KCl and 20% glycerol (<5 volume/weight mL/g) in homogenizer at 4 °C. Store microsomes in 0.5 - 1 mL aliquots at -80 °C. Characterize microsomes for the content of proteins using the method described by Bradford26.\nDetermine the concentration of cytochrome P450 in microsomes.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of P450 enzymes in microsomes is measured as described by Omura and Sato27, determining the absorption of the complex of reduced P450 with carbon monoxide (CO). Carbon monoxide is a toxic compound, and has to be handled with care and in a hood.\n2. Incubations of Test Chemicals (Carcinogens/Drugs) with DNA in the Presence of Enzymatic Systems\nIncubation of test chemicals (carcinogens/drugs) with DNA in the presence of oxidative enzymatic systems containing cytochromes P450\nPrepare incubation mixtures containing, in a final volume of 0.75 mL at 4 °C, the following compounds and enzymatic systems.\n\t\t\nMix 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, (0.375 mL) with 10 mM NADPH or NADPH-generating system (10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM D-glucose 6-phosphate, 10 mM NADP+, 1 U/mL D-glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) (75 µL).\nAdd into this mixture microsomes or pure recombinant P450 in Supersomes, which are microsomes isolated from insect cells transfected with a baculovirus construct containing cDNA of recombinant P450 enzymes, 50 pmol P450 enzymes in 50 µL microsomal or supersomal preparations - hepatic microsomal fractions isolated in the laboratory or from a commercial source.\nAdd 1 mg calf thymus DNA (0.3 mL of stock solution - 3.3 mg/mL in distilled water), and shake on a vortex shaker for 5 s.",
    "Finally, add 7.5 µL 0.1 mM test ellipticine drug dissolved in DMSO and 42.5 µL distilled water to reach a volume of incubation mixture of 0.75 mL. Use chemicals labeled with 3H or 14C or unlabelled chemicals, depending on the procedure for detection of DNA adducts.\nShake on a vortex shaker for 5 s. Incubate in opened tubes at 37 °C for 30 - 60 min.\nAlso prepare two control incubations similarly, but (i) without an activating system (microsomal samples) or (ii) with it, but without the test compound.\nIncubations of test chemicals (carcinogens/drugs) with DNA in the presence of reductive enzymatic systems\nPrepare incubation mixtures containing, in a final volume of 0.75 mL at 4 °C, the following compounds and enzymatic systems.\n\t\t\nAt 4 °C, mix 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Tween 20, (0.375 mL), 10 mM solution of cofactor of NQO1 reductive enzyme (NADPH) (75 µL), cytosolic fraction (hepatic cytosolic fractions - isolated in the laboratory or in the case of using the cytosolic fractions isolated from individual human donors they were obtained from the commercial source containing 1 mg protein (50 µL)).\nAdd 1 mg calf thymus DNA (0.2 mL of stock solution - 3.3 mg/ mL of distilled water), and shake on a shaker for 5 s.\nFinally, add 7.5 µL 0.1 mM test chemical (dissolved in distilled water, methanol, ethanol or DMSO, depending on solubility of the compound) and 42.5 µL distilled water to reach a volume of 0.75 mL for the incubation mixture. Use chemicals labeled with 3H or 14C or unlabelled chemicals, depending on the procedure for detection of DNA adducts (see below).",
    "Purge the reaction mixture with argon for 1 min. Shake on a shaker for 5 s. Incubate in closed tubes at 37 °C for 30 - 60 min.\nAlso prepare two control incubations similarly, but (i) without an activating system (cytosolic fractions) or (ii) with it, but without the test chemicals.\nExtraction of incubation mixtures with organic solvents to remove the excess of test chemicals\nMix the incubation mixture in a test tube with a cap with the same volume of ethyl acetate (or diethyl ether or hexane) by adding these solvents. Shake the contents of the tube on a shaker until an emulsion forms.\nSpin (3 min) at 1,600 x g in a centrifuge at ambient temperature. If the organic and aqueous phases are not properly-separated, spin once more for a longer period or at a higher centrifugation speed.\nRemove the upper, organic phase collecting with a pipette. If small volumes (<400 µL) are used, utilize an automatic pipette fitted with a suitable tip. Cast aside this organic phase.\nRepeat steps 2.3.1., 2.3.2., and 2.3.3. Remove residual organic solvents by a stream of nitrogen gas (at least 5 - 10 min of removal are needed).\nIsolation of DNA from incubations\nExtraction of DNA from solutions with phenol/chloroform and its precipitation with ethanol\nEliminate proteins to isolate DNA from incubation mixtures by extracting proteins from solutions of DNA with phenol, phenol/chloroform (1:1), and chloroform by the procedure shown below.\nCombine the incubation mixture with the same amount of phenol or phenol/chloroform (1:1) in a Falcon or Eppendorf tube with a cap. Stir the mixture until an emulsion forms.",
    "Spin (3 min) at 1,600 x g in a centrifuge at ambient temperature. If the organic and aqueous phases are not properly separated, spin once more for a longer period or at a higher centrifugation speed.\nTransfer the upper water phase with a pipette to a new polypropylene tube. If small volumes (<400 µL) are used, utilize an automatic pipet fitted with a suitable tip. Remove the protein interface together with the organic phase.\nCombine the upper water phase with the same amount of a mixture of phenol and chloroform (1:1). Reproduce steps 2.4.1.2. - 2.4.1.4.\nCombine the upper water phase with the same amount of chloroform and repeat steps 2.4.1.2. - 2.4.1.4. Recover the DNA by precipitation with 2 volumes of cold (-20 °C) ethanol. Determine the volume of the DNA solution.\nAdapt the concentration of monovalent cations by addition of 5 M sodium chloride to the final concentrations of 0.1 M. Stir vigorously. Combine with 2 volumes of cold (-20 °C) ethanol and mix properly. Cool to -20°C.\nStore at -20 °C until DNA is precipitated. When DNA is fragmented during the incubations (e.g., by formation of oxygen radicals during the enzymatic activation reaction) or during the isolation procedure to the size of DNA that is small (<1 kb) or when DNA is present in small amounts (<0.1 mg/mL), the time of cooling has to be increased and the temperature decreased to -70 °C.\nSpin (10 min) at 1,600 x g at 0 °C in a centrifuge. If DNA is present at low concentrations or in the form of small fragments, spin once more for a longer period (30 min). Discard the supernatant.",
    "To remove any solutes (or residual traces of the test chemical) which might be present in precipitated DNA, wash DNA with 70% ethanol and diethyl ether. Wash precipitated DNA with cold (-20 °C) 70% ethanol. Spin (10 min) at 1,600 x g at 0 °C in a centrifuge. Discard the supernatant.\nRepeat the step 2.4.1.10. Wash precipitated DNA with cold (-20 °C) 70% ethanol. Spin (10 min) at 1,600 x g at 0 °C in a centrifuge. Discard the supernatant.\nRepeat the step 2.4.1.10. Put the tube into a vertical state on absorbent paper to remove the residual supernatant. Wash the DNA pellet by adding 1 mL of diethyl ether to discard the potential residues of the test chemical from isolated DNA. Spin (10 min) at 1,600 x g at 0 °C in a centrifuge. Discard the supernatant.\nDissolve the DNA pellet in the appropriate volume (usually in 100 - 400 µL to achieve a DNA concentration of 0.5 - 1 µg/µL) of distilled water (or in 0.15 mM sodium citrate and 1.5 mM sodium chloride). The DNA solution can stand at 4 °C overnight, or can be heated to 37 °C for 10-30 min to increase dissolving DNA.\nBefore storage, separate the DNA into small aliquots (10 - 20 µL), because repeated freezing and thawing of DNA solutions might result in a decrease in adduct concentrations. Store at -80 °C or colder.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Spectrophotometric determination of DNA: The simple and accurate method, which is widely used to measure the amount of DNA in a preparation if the sample is pure (i.e., without significant amounts of contaminants such as protein, phenol, or other nucleic acids), is spectrophotometric measurement of the amount of DNA of UV irradiation absorbed by the bases (see the procedures described previously)28.",
    "Procedures for detection of DNA adduct formation\n32P-postlabeling assay\n\t\tNOTE: DNA hydrolysis utilizes the hydrolysate prepared at this stage for the analysis of adducts (2.5.1.) as well as of normal (unmodified) deoxynucleotides (2.5.7.).\n\t\t\nDissolve micrococcal nuclease (MN) in water at a concentration of ~450 units (U)/mL. Dialyze against distilled water and adjust to 300 U/mL. Dialyze spleen phosphodiesterase (SPD) solution and adjust to 4 U/mL.\nMix MN and SPD to final concentrations 150 mU/µL MN and 2.5 mU/µL SPD (MN/SPD solution). Take DNA solution containing 12.5 µg, and evaporate to dryness in an evaporator. Dissolve in 6.5 µL distilled water.\nAdd 5.0 µL MN/SPD solution (final concentration of MN is 60 mU/µL, final concentration of SPD is 1 mU/µL), and 1.0 µL digestion buffer (final concentration of sodium succinate is 20 mM, final concentration of CaCl2 is 8 mM). The final volume of the mixture is 12.5 µL. Mix and allow reactions for 3 h at 37 °C.\nRemove 2.5 µL (transfer to another tube) for further dilution and analysis of unmodified deoxynucleotides (2.5.7.)\nNuclease P1 enrichment procedure\nTo the remaining 10.0 µL of hydrolysate, add 0.65 µL sodium acetate buffer (final concentration, 40 mM), 0.65 µL ZnCl2 solution (final concentration 0.1 mM), 1.25 µL NP1 solution (final concentration, 0.385 µg/µL), and 0.45 µL distilled water. The final volume of the mixture is 13 µL.\nAllow the mixture to react for 30 min at 37 °C, and end the reaction with addition of 3 µL of Tris solution.\nn-Butanol enrichment procedure",
    "To the remaining 10.0 µL of DNA hydrolysate, add 215 µL of 11.6 mM ammonium formate solution, pH 3.5, and 25 µL 10 mM TBA chloride solution. Extract with 250 µL n-butanol (saturated with water) by vigorous mixing. Spin (3 min) at 1,600 x g to separate layers, and take off the upper n-butanol layer. Extract once more with 250 µL n-butanol (saturated with water), spin, take off the upper n-butanol layer, and combine with former extract.\nAdd 400 µL water (saturated with n-butanol) to this extract, and mix vigorously. Spin to separate layers and delete the bottom aqueous layer. Repeat this washing procedure using 400 µL of water (saturated with n-butanol). Add 3 µL of 250 mM Tris-HCl solution, pH 9.5, to the n-butanol layer. Evaporate n-butanol to dryness in an evaporator at ambient temperature.\nDissolve the residue in 100 µL n-butanol, evaporate to dryness again, and dissolve the residue in 16.0 µL water.\nLabeling of the adducts\nAdd 1 µL of bicine buffer solution (labeling buffer) and 4.5 µL of a mix containing 100 µCi [γ-32P]ATP, 45 pmol of cold ATP, and 10.0 U of T4-PNK (T4-phosphonucleotide kinase) to 16.0 µL solution from NP1 or butanol enrichment mix. The final concentrations of the reagents will be the following: 20 mM bicine, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiotreitol, 0.5 mM spermidine, and 0.5 U/µL T4-PNK, 3 µM ATP. The total volume of the mixture is 20 µL.\nAllow the mixture to react for 30 min at room temperature. Apply the whole sample (i.e. 20 µL) onto the PEI-cellulose TLC plate (2.5.6.).\nEvaluation of efficacy of NP1 or n -butanol enhancing procedures",
    "Wash the bottom of the tube with 50 µL water. Mix vigorously for 30 s and spin (1 min) at 1,600 x g in a centrifuge to establish there is no contamination on the lid. Spot 5 µL on a PEI-cellulose TLC plate (20 x 20 cm). Chromatograph using a solution 280 mM in (NH4)2SO4 and 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.8.\nTLC separation of adducted deoxynucleotides\nPre-wash the TLC plates with distilled water. It is recommended especially for home-made plates.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This wash should be carried out to remove the yellow color from plates, a color which can elevate the background, particularly at the solvent front.\nSpot the whole sample onto the PEI-cellulose TLC plate and start chromatography (2.5.4.); clean-up of adducts is performed by developing the plate in the D1 and D2 directions (Figure 2).\nDevelop the plate in a D1 direction (Figure 2). Use 1.7 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, to ensure that the DNA adducts are remaining at the start of the TLC plate. Analogously, develop the plate in a D2 direction using this buffer. For information on possible buffers for procedures, see solutions described for resolution of several types of adducts20,28.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Development of the plate in a D2 direction can be omitted.\nWash the plate in deionized water after chromatography for about 5 min in two consecutive baths. After that, dry the plates.",
    "Develop the plates in D3 and D4 direction using 3.5 M lithium formate buffer, pH 3.5, containing 8.5 M urea for D3 direction and 0.5 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.8 M LiCl and 8.5 M urea for D4 direction (Figure 2). The solvents must be adjusted to develop the adduct spots over the TLC plate. For information on possible buffers for D3 and D4 developing procedures, see the solutions described for resolution of several types of adducts23,24,25,28.\nTo avoid any problems in D4, after development in a D4 direction and a water wash, develop the plates (along D4) in 1.7 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.0 (usually assigned as development in direction D5), to the top of a paper wick (12 x 11.5 cm).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The D5 direction can also be omitted. In this case, it is necessary to open the TLC tank when the solvent has reached the top of the TLC, and allow a run for up to 60 min. This method is even better than adding a wick (the method frequently used in many laboratories to delete any problems in D4).\nQuantification of normal (unmodified) deoxynucleotides after hydrolysis\nDilute an aliquot of hydrolysate (from 2.5.1. describing DNA hydrolysis) with distilled water, (i.e., 2.5 µL of the digestion mixture from 2.5.1. adjusted to 250 µL, and 10 µL of this solution adjusted to 150 µL).\nTake a 5 µL (10 pmol normal deoxynucleotides) aliquot of this digest, add 2.5 µL 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, and label as in 2.5.4. (the final volume of the mixture is 10 µL). Allow to react for 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Take a 4 µL aliquot of the mixture and dilute to 750 µL with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Mix and spin to establish there is no contamination of the lid. Apply 5 µL on a PEI-cellulose TLC plate. Develop the TLC plate in a solution of 280 mM (NH4)2SO4 and 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.5. Allow to dry after TLC.\nUse autoradiography that is performed for approximately 45 min at ambient temperature to localize the four unmodified deoxynucleotide bis-phosphates. Cut spot for quantification by either liquid scintillation or Cerenkov counting.\nCalculation of the relative adduct labeling (RAL)\nDetermine the values of the counts in the adduct spots and the counts in the aliquot of labeled unmodified (normal) deoxynucleotides.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The latter have to be determined on 180,000 counts less material than the former, a figure which is the conversion factor to apply to the count of unmodified (normal) deoxynucleotides for evaluating the RAL values of adduct levels. RAL of DNA adducts is calculated according to the equation (2) shown above.\nDetection of binding of the test carcinogens or drugs to DNA using radioactive-labeled drug\nEvaluate the 3H or 14C radioactivity of DNA modified with chemicals by liquid scintillation counting.\nAdd 10 - 50 µL of DNA solution to 3 mL of a scintillation solution in the scintillation vial. Mix well. Measure the radioactivity using the scintillation counter.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
