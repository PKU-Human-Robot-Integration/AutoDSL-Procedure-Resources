    "NOTE: For the studies performed in our lab all subjects gave their written, informed consent to participate and all experiments were performed with UK National Health Service Ethics Committee approval (London Research Ethics Committee; reference: 10/H0718/10) and in accordance with the Human Tissue Act and Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Initial Preparation Prior to Muscle Biopsy (15 min)\nMake human skeletal muscle growth medium. To a graduated sterile 50 ml conical tube add 2.5 ml of the supplement mix, 10 ml fetal calf serum, antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) and glutamine to the correct final concentrations (Table 1) then fill the tube to 50 ml with skeletal muscle basal medium.\nPut 15 ml of the skeletal muscle basal medium in a sterile 20 ml conical tube and weigh it. Once weighed place this tube on ice. Use this to receive the human muscle sample.\nIn another 20 ml tube prepare 10 ml of a Collagenase D and Dispase II enzyme solution to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml each by dissolving stock aliquots of these enzymes in skeletal muscle basal medium. Filter-sterilize this solution by passing it through a 0.22 μm filter. Place this sterile enzyme mix in the incubator or water bath at 37 °C for 15 min to warm up.\n\tNOTE: This mixture of enzymes is slightly gentler than trypsin and better maintains cell viability17.\nSet aside a Petri dish and a pair of sterile scalpels.\n2. Muscle Biopsy Procedure (45 min-1 hr)\nPrior to recruiting participants, obtain full ethical clearance and procedural approval (including relevant vaccinations for experimenters) from all relevant governing bodies, committees and healthcare providers (e.g., ethical, institutional, governmental etc.).\nCreate a sterile field the around the leg (e.g., with sterile surgical sheets) and clean thoroughly the area around the biopsy site with an antiseptic antibacterial agent (chlorhexidine).",
    "Anaesthetize the proposed biopsy site on the volunteer’s leg by local injection of 2% lidocaine in the subcutaneous region overlying the fascia of the vastus lateralis muscle.\nMake a ~5 mm wide incision using a sterile surgical blade through the skin and fascia and perform the Bergström needle biopsy procedure18 with additional suction.\nUsing sterile forceps remove the muscle from the needle lumen and immerse in basal medium on ice. Transport the tissue to the laboratory for further processing as soon as possible although viable myogenic cells can be obtained after periods 24 hr or more.\nDebrief the subject, cleanse and seal the incision site with multiple sterile adhesive skin-closure strips and aseptically dress with a outer waterproof covering.\n3. Isolating Muscle-derived Precursor Cells (1 hr, 30 min)\nRemove the tube containing the muscle sample and weigh it (make sure tube is dry by wiping with tissue). Calculate the weight of the muscle sample by subtracting the weight of the tube containing medium and sample from the tube containing medium alone.\nSwirl the solution several times to wash the muscle sample of blood. Let the muscle sediment at room temperature for 30-60 sec.\n\t\nRemove almost the entire volume of medium from the tube, first using an electronic pipetting aid or aspirator but leave approximately 2-3 ml in the tube.\nInvert the tube on to a sterile petri dish allowing the remaining fluid to carry the muscle sample on to the dish; use the sterile scalpel to extract any remaining muscle fragments.Rotate the dish to mobilize the remaining liquid and remove it with a pipette.Remove any visible pieces of fat or connective tissue.\nFor biopsies weighing 100-400 mg, add 3 ml of warm enzyme solution and using sterile scalpels cut the muscle sample into very small pieces (<1-2 mm3).",
    "Using a wide bore 25 ml pipette draw up the muscle fragments and enzyme solution and transfer to a sterile 10 ml conical tube. Wash the petri dish with a further 3-5 ml of collagenase and dispase enzyme solution and using a smaller 10 ml pipette collect any remaining muscle fragments and place in the tube. The exact volume is not critical.\nPlace the vial in a 37 °C incubator (or water bath) for 60 min with trituration (10 ml pipette) every 15 min.\nAfter 1 hr terminate enzymatic dissociation by addition of an equivalent volume of fresh pre-warmed growth medium and pass the cell suspension through a 100 μm filter to remove any large myofibre debris. Centrifuge the filtered cell solution at 657 x g for 6 min at room temperature (20-25 ˚C).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5-7 ml of growth medium and plate in an uncoated T-25 tissue culture flask. Transfer this plate to the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 7 days. Change the medium every 48 hr. At this stage myogenic cells are very small and rounded and difficult to discern from non-myogenic cells.\n\t\nOn the first medium change, centrifuge the supernatant to pellet any non-adherent cells. Re-suspend these in fresh medium and re-plate.\nAfter 7 days in culture, ensure that most of the myogenic (and fibroblast) cells have attached but the cells have not yet reached confluence. Purify the myogenic precursors and perform MACS according to a protocol originally developed by in the laboratories of Gherardi and Chazaud19,20 and further modified by us5.\n4. Immunomagnetic Bead Sorting of Cells Based on CD56 Expression (1.5 hr)",
    "After 7 days rinse the cell monolayer (which typically will contain 50-60% myogenic cells5) with three exchanges of room temperature phosphate buffer solution (PBS) to remove any remaining non-adherent cells and debris from isolation.\n\t\nTrypinize the cells (0.04% Trypsin in Ca2+-free PBS with 0.73 mM EDTA) for 3 minutes. Once cells have detached, add 5-10 ml of skeletal muscle growth medium to prevent over-digestion. Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 657 x g for 6 min at room temperature (20-25 ˚C) and resuspend in an appropriate volume of complete medium for counting.\nCount a small sample of the cell suspension using the desired method (e.g., using a hemocytometer or an automated counting device) and calculate starting cell number and viability.\nPlate a few wells in a 96 well plate (or larger vessel if required) for immunocytochemical or flow cytometry based characterization of the population prior to sorting (fibroblasts and myogenic cells will be the most abundant cells types present).\nTo the cell suspension add 15 ml of sterile PBS to dilute cells and medium. Centrifuge the cells again and resuspend them in 170 µl of room temperature sorting buffer (1% BSA in a MACS rinsing solution, sterilized via passing through a 0.22 µm filter).\n\t\nAdd 35 μl of well mixed magnetic microbeads conjugated to a CD56 primary antibody (clone AF12-7H3, 130-050-401) into the cell solution, pipette to mix and leave to incubate for 15 min at 4 ˚C with gentle agitation at the halfway point.\nAfter incubation, dilute the cell and bead solution with 10 ml of MACS sorting buffer and centrifuge at 657 x g for 6 min. Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of sorting buffer.",
    "Add the MACs separator (magnet) to the MACS holding stand. Take care when adding magnet to the stand due to the strong magnetic field. Slot in the column and fit the pre-separation filter. Pipette 1 ml of sorting buffer through the pre-separation filter and column for lubrication.\nImmediately after this, gently mix the cell suspension and drip the entire 1 ml through Pre-separation filter and into the column.\nWash the column three times with 1 ml (or 500 μl) of sorting buffer. Collect the non-retained cells which pass through the column on the first sort in a sterile 50 ml conical tube containing a small amount of growth medium. These cells are the first sort CD56– fraction and will be highly enriched for connective tissue fibroblasts. Do not let the column dry out between washes.\nAfter washes the remove the pre-separation filter and add 2.5 ml of MACS buffer to the column. Then immediately remove the column from the magnet and collect the first sort CD56+ fraction in a separate 50 ml conical tube by depressing the plunger into the top of the column.\n\tNOTE: The plunger fits very tightly into the top of the column and can be quite tricky to operate; however, this must be done while the column is still full of buffer, so speed is required. Avoid depressing the plunger too hard and fast.\nPrior to plating assess the viability of the cells using, for example, the trypan blue assay. Determine the percentage of viable cells from 8 x 1 mm2 counting fields (both chambers of the hemocytometer).",
    "NOTE: The cells can be either single or double sorted depending on the purity required. If done carefully these cells tolerate the double sorting procedure very well and viability is very high >95%.  For double sorting, set up another column, lubricate with 1 ml sorting of buffer and proceed from step 4.6. \n\t\nIf imaging is to be performed, plate cells directly on to glass coverslips situated in 24 well dishes21 and coated with your choice of ECM molecule for cell attachment (e.g. collagen or laminin). Here, use 0.1-0.5 mg/ml collagen-I (Table 3).\n5. Sorting of Human Muscle-derived Fibroblasts Immediately After Isolation.\nTo purify fibroblast progenitors immediately after isolation, employ the protocol as above with the following modifications:\n\t\nImmediately after isolation resuspend cells in complete medium and filter once though a 100 µm cell strainer and then again though a 40 µm strainer. Add 5 ml of PBS and spin at 657 x g for 6 min.\nResuspend the cells in MACS sorting buffer and incubate in Anti-human Fibroblast Microbeads for 15-30 min at room temperature.\nUse the LS column and the Midi-MACS separator (Table 3) and install the 40 µm pre-separation filter.\nPerform one or two sorts depending on the purity required, transfer the cells as soon as possible into serum-containing medium, perform a count, and plate out at the desired density\n6. Immunocytochemical Staining (1 day and overnight).\nFix cells in their wells by the addition of an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde in ice-cold PBS for 10 min with gentle agitation. After 10 min aspirate fixative and wash twice with PBS.\nTo immunostain cell surface antigens, block cells for at least 1 hr in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and then probe with the relevant primary antibodies (Table 4).",
    "For intracellular antigens, permeabilize cells after fixation by addition of 0.2% Triton-X 100 in PBS with 1% BSA and NaN3 (0.01%) for 10 min, then block and incubate with primary antibodies. Perform all primary antibody incubations overnight at room temperature (or at 4 °C) with gentle agitation on a rocking platform.\nRemove unbound primary antibody and wash cells three times with cold PBS. Incubate for 1 hour incubation with species-specific fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies (Table 4) at room temperature.\nAfter removal of unbound secondary antibodies, rinse cells with three exchanges of PBS and then counterstain with the fluorescent DNA dye Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) solution for 10 min on a rocking platform.\nFor the simultaneous visualization of both cell surface antigens and intracellular antigens, probe cells first with primary antibodies to cell surface antigens followed by their appropriate secondary antibodies. Next, re-fix the cells in cold PFA, permeabilize, block and incubate with primary antibodies against cytoplasmic or nuclear antigens followed by their appropriate secondary antibodies.\nAfter staining, remove coverslips from their wells using curved forceps and rinse the back of the coverslip using distilled water. Lay the coverslip cell slide down on a drop of anti-fade mounting medium22 set on a glass microscope slide.\n7. Oil Red O Staining in Combination with Immunofluorescent Staining of Cells (2 hr)\nReveal the lipid content of cells plated in 24 well dishes by staining with Oil Red O (1-([4-(Xylylazo)xylyl]azo)-2-naphthol)5,23. First prepare a stock solution of 0.5% (w/v) Oil Red O by dissolving 500 mg of Oil Red O in 60 ml of 99% triethyl-phosphate and 40 ml of distilled water. Maintain this solution at room temperature in the dark until use.",
    "On the day of use, make a 36% (w/v) triethyl-phosphate working solution, containing 12 ml of Oil Red O stock solution and 8 ml of distilled water. Filter this solution through filter paper number 42 to remove all crystallised Oil Red O (which impairs image quality).\nGently warm this working solution in a water bath for 1 hr after which the solution is spun at 1,200 x g for 6 min. Remove the supernatant and filter again through filter paper (number 42) and transfer to a fresh 20 ml tube.\nAfter cells have been fixed, permeabilised and immunostained, remove the PBS and add 500 μl of Oil Red O/Triethyl-phosphate solution to the wells for 60 min. Triton-X at the concentration used here for cell membrane permeabilisation does not affect cellular lipid content23.\n\tNOTE: Oil Red O is excited by wavelengths between 540 and 580 nm and hence the Texas-Red filter can be used to detect Oil Red O emission in fluorescence microscopy23. Note that the fluorescence emission from Oil Red O can occasionally leak into the far red channel if cells are very strongly stained (i.e., very high fat content).\nAfter incubation, remove excess Oil Red O and rinse the cells five times with 500 μl of PBS. Mount the coverslips as for immunostaining as described in section 6. Detect Oil Red O dye by both brightfield/phase contrast microscopy or by epifluorescence microscopy using the Texas Red filter (shift free, EX BP 560/40, BS FT 585, EM BP 630/75, Carl Zeiss).\n8. Obtaining Micrographs from Fluorescence Microscopy for Subsequent Analysis",
    "NOTE: Ensure that slides to be compared quantitatively are stained with the same solutions, photographed at identical conditions (e.g., exposure, camera and acquisition settings etc.) and captured in the same microscopy session. All post-acquisition formatting should also be identical and be in strict accordance with suggested guidelines for digital images24.\nFor image acquisition (widefield microscopy), turn on the microscope and fluorescence light source and leave for the recommended amount of time to allow the fluorescence light source to warm up and stabilize.\nSet the dark current for the camera by blocking the light path to the camera; acquire an image at maximum resolution and use this to correct subsequently acquired images.\nIlluminate immunofluorescent probes by epifluorescence delivered by liquid light guides (flexible tube of fluoroplastic filled with phenylmethyl silicone oil) and signals visualised through red (filter set 45 HQ Texas red shift free, green (filter set 44 FITC special shift free) and blue (filter set 49 DAPI shift free) band pass filters on an inverted epi-fluorescence microscope (10X, 20X, 40X, plan apochromatic objectives with 0.25, 0.75, 0.95 numerical apertures respectively).\nTo avoid pixel saturation find the optimal exposure within the linear range of the detector for each fluorescent marker using the ‘Overexposure’ feature of image acquisition software. Make a note of the standardized exposure for each fluorescent label.\nCapture individual channels and save grayscale or pseudocolored tiff (tagged image file format) images files in the highest bit depth (preferably 16 bit - 65,536 gray values) provided by the recording device (e.g. cooled CCD (charged coupled device) fitted to the microscope). Set the image resolution to 1,388 x 1,040 or higher. Be sure to include a scale bar or object of known dimensions in the image.",
    "Where possible save files in 16 bit tagged image file format (.tiff) and not in .jpeg format to prevent loss of information25.\nIf there are any concerns over the evenness of illumination (software bundled with microscope may have automatic correction for this) take a ‘flat-field’ image of coverslip without cells but stained and mounted in the same way as experimental slides; this can be used to correct for illumination defects post-acquisition in image analysis software.\nFor image acquisition (confocal microscopy), optimize detector gain and laser power for each imaging experiment (avoid saturation). In general, the fluorescence measured is proportional to the laser power level. Set pinhole size to ‘1 airy’ to achieve best signal-to-noise ratio (improved resolution may be achieved at 0.5 airy for particularly strong signals). Take optical sections at different levels along the z-axis through the antibody-labeled cells and save a 16 bit maximum projection for each channel for image analysis.\n9. Performing Measurements of Fluorescently Labeled Nuclear Transcription Factors Using Image Processing and Analysis Software (5 min per field of view).\nAccess individual tiff image files and overlay corresponding channels by clicking and dragging one image into another. Each channel will then appear as a separate layer in the layers panel.\nSelect lighten from the filter menu to allow layers beneath to be visualized concurrently. Alternatively, adjust the opacity of the top layers to 50%.\n\tNOTE: Tiff images can be saved with the ‘lossless’ Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) data compression to lower file sizes without loss of information.",
    "In the analysis window (Analysis > Select Data Points > Custom), select Analysis and choose the measurements required (e.g., Integrated density, mean density, circularity, histogram etc.). Discard any unnecessary measurements by unchecking the box next to them. If area measurements are required in µm click on Analysis > Set Measurement Scale. The ruler tool will automatically appear – trace the length of the scale bar and enter its known length in micrometers. The software will then convert area measurements into square microns.\n\tNOTE: If the histogram analysis is selected, when measurements are recorded an additional folder will appear (the location of which can be chosen) with 8 bit histograms for each individual selection area in the micrograph as well as the summation of all individual selections (this always appears as Histogram-1 if multiple selections are made). This analysis cannot be performed by the software in 16 bit format, but is very useful for examining the distribution of pixel intensities throughout an object of interest.\nFor analysis of nuclear fluorescence intensity first construct a representative ‘Color Range Selection Mask’ (CRSM) for Hoechst or DAPI stained DNA to define nuclear area. Once the desired channel images are overlaid, only the Hoechst channel layer should be left in view by ensuring the ‘eye icon’ adjacent to it in the layers tab is selected and then layer is highlighted (turns blue), whilst all other layers should be deselected. Make sure the blending dropdown is set back to ‘Normal’ in the layers tab.",
    "Open the Color Range dialogue box (Select > Color Range) and set the selection option dropdown to ‘Sampled colors’. With the selection preview set to ‘quick mask’ (red background) select all the blue color tones within the nuclei by holding the shift key (‘+’ sign appears) and clicking within the nuclei using the eye dropper tool that appears.\n\t\nIf unwanted tones are selected, remove them by pressing the Alt key (‘─’sign appears) and clicking on them. Maintain the fuzziness scale at zero so that only manually selected color tones are included in the measurement and ‘Localized color clusters’ should be left unchecked.\nSave this CRSM to the computer’s hard disc as a-program-specific extract file (.AXT file). With another random field of nuclei, load, update, and save the CRSM (Select, Color Range, Load). Do this for at least five random fields to ensure that nuclear selections are representative.\n\t\nUse a colored version of a grayscale image for the creation of a mask to isolate features because the human eye is better able to discriminate between different shades of color than between varying shades of gray26.\nUse the nuclear CRSM to segment nuclear regions for staining. Once nuclei have been selected click on Image > Adjustment > Threshold and move the slider all the way to the right, such that the nuclei turn black. Alternatively, right click and select ‘Fill’ then choose ‘Fill to: black’. Then click on Select > Inverse and now press delete to remove all background (if the option appears choose ‘fill to: White’). This essentially binarizes the image based on your selection. Then load the watershed plugin from the filters tab to separate overlapping nuclei (Filter > Binary image > Watershed feature separation).",
    "If many nuclei are heavily overlapping, remove the nuclei from analysis by deselecting them (Hold the Alt key and loosely draw around them with the lasso tool).\nOn the now binary nuclear layer, go to Select > Color Range and > Shadows, to select individual nuclei. Alternative hold shift and click within any one black nucleus. All nuclei will immediately be selected. Then transfer this selection to the layer containing nuclear transcription factor staining (e.g. myogenin) by selecting that layer and deselecting all other layers. Marching lines will now show the position of nuclei in the myogenin channel.\nIf working with pseudocolored images only click on the Channels palette (to the right of the layers tab) and select only the green channel (the image will now appear gray). Then click on Image > Mode > Grayscale. A warning will appear ‘Flatten visible layers and discard hidden layers’ click OK, then another warning will say ‘discard other channels’ click OK again. Only a single layer of grayscale selected nuclei will now be present in the layers palette.\n\t\nClick Record Measurements in the Measurement Log to obtain data for the selected nuclei. If the layer to be analyzed (e.g. myogenin staining) is already a raw 16 bit grayscale image then simply press Record Measurements.\nExport selected measurements as TXT file to the location of your choice. These can then be further processed and analyzed in other data handling software packages\n\t\tNOTE: The Edit > step backward command (press all of Alt, Ctrl and Z keys simultaneously) restores all previous layers if required.\nCorrect for non specific background fluorescence27 for results to be quantitative and comparable as measurements of fluorescence intensity are always a mixture of signal and background.",
    "Select the square selection tool and check ‘fixed size’ choose 20 by 20 pixels (or larger if desired and depending on the confluency of cells in the image). While holding shift select ten or more background areas spread throughout the field of view. Press ‘Record Measurements’ in the Measurement Log.\nCalculate the average integrated density (sum of all pixel gray values) per pixel of all 10 selected background regions (given as the ‘mean grey value’ in the Measurement log). Multiply the average background density per pixel by the number of pixels in the target object (i.e., each nucleus) to give average background per object.\nSubtract background fluorescence from the objects original integrated density to yield the final background corrected value. This approach accounts for potential field to field variation in non-specific background fluorescence.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is of utmost importance to select only bona fide background regions as this correction has a considerable impact on the final values. Zooming in using the magnifying glass is recommended when making selections.\nIt may also be useful to divide the general background corrected value by the area of the nucleus in pixels (same as taking mean grey level/intensity per nucleus) to minimize any potential influence of nuclear localized background signal that would contribute more to the integrated density value with increasing nuclear size (Figure 3C).\nSubscription Required.
