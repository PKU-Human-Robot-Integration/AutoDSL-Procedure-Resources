    "Note: Many of the steps described below for harvesting cells, milling them to powder, and carrying out an affinity capture can be viewed in our online video protocol (LaCava et al., 2016). Cell culturing and harvestingThe tetracycline inducible EXOSC10-3xFLAG HEK-293 cell line can be obtained by contacting the authors or by following the manufacturer’s instructions. Except where noted, standard mammalian cell culturing procedures apply (Freshney 2011; Uphoff and Drexler, 2013).Adherent cell growthSeed ~107 cells on each of 16 x 500 cm2 square dishes in 90 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v FBS and 1x P/S (DMEM-FBS-P/S).Note: 16 x 500 cm2 square dishes should yield at least 10 g of cell pellet, wet cell weight (WCW).When the cells reach ~90% confluency, remove the medium and induce the expression of EXOSC10-3xFLAG by adding fresh DMEM-FBS-P/S supplemented with 5 ng/ml tetracycline (Tet). Harvest the cells at 24 h post induction by scraping in ice-cold PBS–we use 30 ml/plate. Note: Alternatively, the cells can be harvested by trypsinization. For each plate, wash the cells with 20 ml PBS, add 10 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, tilt the dish to expose the cell monolayer, remove the excess liquid, and place them back into the CO2 incubator for ~5 min. Resuspend the cells in 10 ml DMEM-FBS-P/S and transfer to a 50 ml tube.Centrifuge the harvested cells at 1,000 x g for 5 min (4 °C).Discard the supernatant, resuspend, and combine the pellets in ice-cold PBS (~100 ml total volume), within two 50 ml tubes.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min (4 °C).Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellets in ice-cold PBS (~1 volume of PBS per volume of the pellet), and transfer the solution to a 20 ml capped syringe.",
    "Seal upper opening of the syringe with Parafilm (to avoid any accidental spillage) and place it inside a 50 ml tube.Centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min (4 °C).Remove any remaining liquid, replace the plunger, and carefully inject the content into LN2.Note: First, fill 250 ml plastic beaker (placed inside a Styrofoam box) with LN2, then inject the cells directly into LN2. Store at -80 °C prior to cryomilling.Suspension cell growthFor this protocol you will need a platform shaker with appropriate tolerances, installed inside of a 37 °C, humidified, 8% CO2 incubator. Suspension cell growth offers a convenient and cost effective way to generate large quantities of cells and maintain continuous cultures. The protocol presented here is adapted from a method we previously adapted (Muller et al., 2005) and applied to HEK-293TLD cells (Dai et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2016). Using HEK-293 Flp-In T-REx cells, suspension growth may yield ~3-5 million cells per ml, with growth slowing above ~3 million/ml. Obtaining accurate cell counts can be challenging because these suspensions tend to grow in clumps and require trituration by pipetting to be counted in a hemocytometer. Yields in WCW should be ≥ 4 g per 400 ml culture of cells expressing 3xFLAG-tagged EXOSC10 at near the endogenous level.Seed cells from stocks in the standard way and obtain 2 x 175 cm2 flasks of nearly confluent (90%+) cells. We use 25 ml of medium per 175 cm2 flask.Split the cells into 4 x 175 cm2 flasks in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM-FBS-P/S and Freestyle medium supplemented with 2% v/v FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.5x P/S (the latter, referred to as conditioning medium). This initiates conditioning of adherent cells for suspension growth.",
    "Note: We have been unable to inoculate new suspension cultures directly from frozen cell stocks of suspension conditioned HEK-293 Flp-In T-REx cells. Therefore, we freshly condition cells for each new suspension growth, and then maintain cells in suspension for the needed duration. The difficulty in inoculating directly to suspension and the lower maximal cell density observed for HEK-293 Flp-In T-REx cells compared to HEK-293TLD cells may be due to the absence of the SV40 large T antigen in the former (Ahuja et al., 2005; Taylor et al., 2016).At the next cell splitting use a 1:3 mixture of DMEM-FBS-P/S and conditioning medium, transfer the cells into 8 x 175 cm2 flasks and grow to near confluence.Wash the cells with 10 ml PBS and discard the wash, then release the cells from the flasks using 0.1x TrypLE (1:10 dilution in PBS). Add 1.5 ml of 0.1x TrypLE solution, tilt each flask to expose the cell monolayer, and then remove the excess liquid. Incubate the flasks at RT for 10 min.Resuspend the released cells from each flask in 10 ml of conditioning medium. Combine 40 ml of the cell suspension and 60 ml of conditioning medium supplemented with 200 μl of 0.5% w/v phenol red (final 0.001% w/v) in a 1 L square glass bottle. This typically results in two 100 ml suspension cultures at a cell density of around a couple million per ml. Suspension cultures should be inoculated at between ~0.5-3 million cells/ml. Leave the bottle caps one-full-turn open (from just-closed) and set the cultures shaking at 130 RPM within the incubator.Note: The phenol red (PR) functions as a pH indicator and an indirect method of monitoring cell density in culture, complementing cell counting.",
    "The solution should have a light red appearance similar to commercially available DMEM, which also frequently contains this additive. The working volume for 1 L glass bottles in this protocol is between 100-400 ml. Two 400 ml cultures should ultimately yield at least 8 g WCW.Monitor the culture by cell counting and medium color. When the cell density is very near or exceeds 3 million cells/ml and begins to lighten in color towards orange, dilute the culture to 1-2 million cells/ml with 100 ml of Freestyle medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.5x P/S, and 0.001% PR (no FBS)–resulting in a 1% final FBS concentration while other reagent concentrations remain the same (referred to as suspension medium). All future dilutions can be made with suspension medium.Note: Cells are typically round, single, and relatively easy to count for a few days after the initial inoculation, and then will become increasingly clumpy, even adhering to some extent to the side of the flask where the liquid line reaches.Continue to monitor the culture by cell counting and medium color. When the cell density is very near or exceeds 3 million cells/ml and begins to lighten in color towards orange, dilute the cultures to ≤ 3 million cells/ml with 200 ml suspension medium. Once this 400 ml of medium is very near or exceeds 3 million cells/ml, remove 50 ml of the culture from each and use this to seed two or more new 100 ml cultures at ~0.5-2 million cells/ml (if desired). To the remaining 350 ml of culture, add 50 ml of suspension medium supplemented with 8 ng/ml Tet (1 ng/ml final), and incubate overnight (~16-24 h).Note: We observed that 1 ng/ml of tetracycline in suspension culture was sufficient to give expression comparable to 5 ng/ml in adherent growth.",
    "However, we encourage researchers to test expression in their hands by carrying out an anti-RRP6 Western blot after induction (Domanski et al., 2012). This protocol can be miniaturized using smaller culture vessels for pre-tests of that nature.Harvest the cells by centrifugation, wash and freeze in LN2 as described in steps d-j in section A1–Adherent cell growth–above.Cryomilling procedureThe cryogenic disruption of the mammalian cell pellets has been previously described (Domanski et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2016; LaCava et al., 2016). Briefly, pre-cool a milling jar, 2 x 20 mm grinding balls, a metal spatula, and a 50 ml tube by immersing in LN2. Remove any LN2 from the jar chamber and place the cell pellets inside. Set the counter balance and clamp the jar in the Retsch PM 100. Run the machine for 3 milling cycles of 3 min each (reverse rotation, 1 min interval, no break time) at 400 RPM. Cool down the milling jar with LN2 between cycles. Recover the resulting cell powder using a spatula and transfer to 50 ml tube. Store at -80 °C.Coupling of the anti-FLAG M2 antibodies to Dynabeads M-270 epoxyThe production of anti-FLAG magnetic medium has been previously described in detail (Cristea and Chait, 2011; Domanski et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2016) and can also be carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with comparable results. Briefly, prepare 20 μl of 0.5 μg/μl antibody, in a sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffered 1 M ammonium sulfate solution, per mg of magnetic beads to be antibody-conjugated (i.e., 10 μg of antibody, in 20 μl solution, will be used per mg of beads). Combine the antibody solution and the magnetic beads and incubate overnight (16-24 h) at 30-37 °C with rotation.",
    "The mixing applied should be sufficient to ensure the beads remain in suspension for the duration of the incubation. For small batches, conjugation can be performed at 37 °C in a thermomixer (≥ 1,200 RPM). After coupling, remove the excess antibody solution, wash the beads to remove residual uncoupled antibodies, and finally resuspend the antibody-conjugated magnetic medium in 1x PBS [final] containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 50% v/v glycerol (storage solution): add 6.7 μl of storage solution per 1 mg of medium (resulting in a slurry of ~15% w/v) and store at -20 °C. The slurry can be stored in this way for at least 1 year without any noticeable loss of performance. Affinity purificationA general procedure describing and demonstrating best practices for affinity purification using mammalian cell powder and magnetic media has been previously described (LaCava et al., 2016). The following implementation has been optimized for obtaining human RNA exosomes. Here, DIS3- exosomes are referred to as ExoI and the DIS3+ exosomes are ExoII.Pre-cool a metal spatula and 4 x 2 ml safe-lock tubes in LN2. Weight out 4 x 250 mg of HEK-293 EXOSC10-3xFLAG cell powder.Note: It is important to keep the cell powder frozen. Leave the tubes in LN2 until the next step is initiated. Place the samples in the rack, open the caps, and let them stand at room temperature for 1 min.Add 1,250 μl ExoI or ExoII solution to each (see Recipes).Note: ExoI solution yields DIS3- exosomes, whereas ExoII yields DIS3+ exosomes. Vortex at maximum speed to fully resuspend the cell powder (should not require more than 30 sec), and immediately place the samples on ice.Note: Once the cell powder is resuspended, the sample should be held on ice between all manipulations throughout the procedure unless otherwise stated.",
    "Briefly sonicate to completely disperse and homogenize the cell powder. Use 4 pulses, 2 sec each (~30 J total per 250 mg sample) (LaCava et al., 2016).Note: If clumps are visible, the sonication step should be repeated until no clumps are obvious by visual inspection.Clarify the extract by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 10 min (4 °C).While the samples are in the centrifuge, distribute 4x 25 μl anti-FLAG beads slurry into 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes and wash twice with 1 ml of the extraction solution of choice to thoroughly remove the storage solution.Note: We use 10 μl of the beads slurry per 100 mg of the cell powder. To wash the beads, combine 1 ml of extraction solution with 25 μl anti-FLAG magnetic medium (slurry) in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube and vortex briefly to fully resuspend the beads. Pulse-spin the tube briefly in a mini-centrifuge to collect all the solution at the bottom and then place the tube in a magnetic tube rack until the beads are collected at the side of the tube. Remove the supernatant using a pipet or an aspirator, and repeat the washing step one more time. Perform both washing steps at room temperature. After washing, the beads may be held on ice and are ready for use. Alternatively, one can also wash a total of 100 μl anti-FLAG medium and distribute across 4 tubes after washing. Combine the clarified extracts with the pre-washed beads. Incubate for 1 h with rotation at 4 °C (cold room).Collect the beads on a magnet, remove the supernatant, and wash with 1 ml of ice cold extraction solution, in the manner noted above.Wash with extraction solution two more times. Move each sample to a fresh tube during the second wash.",
    "Note: Moving each sample (beads resuspended in extraction solution) to a fresh tube minimizes contamination of the eluate. Cell extract proteins non-specifically adsorbed to the internal surfaces of the tube used for affinity capture may be released into the sample during subsequent manipulations.After the 3rd wash, spin the samples briefly in a mini-centrifuge.Place again on a magnet and carefully remove any remaining liquid.Add 30 μl of elution solution (1 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptide diluted from the stock in extraction solution) to each tube.Incubate the samples at room temperature for 15 min with gentle agitation. ~60% power on a vortex equipped with a head for multiple 1.5/2.0 ml tubes.Note: Make sure the beads are not being mixed too vigorously, nor settling at the bottom of the tube.Place on a magnet and collect the supernatants. Add 30 μl of the extraction solution to wash the beads. Collect as above and pool the fractions together. Keep the samples on ice prior to loading on a gradient. DTSSP crosslinking to obtain ExoIIDIS3 can be co-purified with the exosome in the ExoII extraction solution. However, it dissociates during sedimentation in a glycerol gradient. To preserve this interaction, we used chemical crosslinking. DTSSP will enhance the preservation of the DIS3/exosome interaction, but DIS3 enzymatic activity will be compromised by this treatment.Add 2 μl of freshly prepared 1.2 mM DTSSP per 10 μl of ExoII prepared by elution with 3xFLAG as described above.Carry out the crosslinking reaction for 50 min at RT.Quench by adding 2 μl 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.Keep on ice prior to loading on a gradient.Rate zonal centrifugationThe following settings and parameters are optimized for an SW 55 Ti rotor in a Beckman Optima L series ultracentrifuge. For MLS-50 details, refer to (Domanski et al., 2016).",
    "Prepare a 10-40% glycerol gradient using the BioComp Gradient Master instrument (short cap, 10-40% glycerol v/v) or other appropriate method. Always prepare an extra gradient to use as a balance.Pre-cool formed gradient to 4 °C (typically ≥ 1 h in a cold room). Load the sample(s) by gently pipetting onto the top of the gradient. Note: To avoid disrupting the top layer of the gradient, rest the pipette tip against the wall of the tube, just above the meniscus of the glycerol solution, and slowly eject the sample.Run the gradient using the following settings: minimum acceleration; no brake; 4 °C; 50k RPM; 6 h 36 min.After the run is completed, collect the fractions using a BioComp Piston Gradient Fractionator (consult the manufacturer’s instructions), or other appropriate method. We used the following settings with manual fraction collection: distance–2 mm, speed–0.3 mm/sec. This collection regime will produce a meniscus fraction, ~20 fractions of ~225 μl, and a bottom fraction. Some variations will be observed depending on the specific set-up implemented, however, using the described procedure and setup we retrieved the peak of sedimented ExoI in fraction 11 and ExoII in fractions 11 and 12.SDS-PAGE analysis of gradient fractionsMix 14 μl of the gradient fraction with 5 μl of 4x LDS and 1 μl of 10x reducing agent (or 500 mM DTT); heat at 70 °C for 10 min for ExoI (DIS3-) fractions or to 75 °C for 20 min for DTSSP-treated ExoII (DIS3+) fractions.Load the samples on a 26-well, 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel, following the manufacturer’s instructions.Run at 200 V until the tracking dye reaches the bottom of the gel cassette.Remove the gel from the plastic cassette and place in a clean container.Stain with the silver or Sypro Ruby following manufacturers’ instructions."
