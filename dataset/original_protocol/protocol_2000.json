    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInitial culture of hPSCs\nTiming: 45–60 min\nIn this step, hPSCs are thawed from cryotube containing frozen hPSCs to commence culture of hPSCs.\nPlace the required amount of refrigerated mTeSR1 solution in a 50 mL conical tube covered by a shading sheet at room temperature (approximately 21°C) for approximately 30–60 min to warm.\nNote: 10 mL of medium is required for a 10 cm dish, or 2 mL of medium per well in a 6-well plate. Moreover, 10 mL of medium is required for pelleting thawed cells and 10 mL is required for the initial culture of iPSCs.\nThaw an aliquot of 10 mM of Y-27632 diluted with DMSO.\nAdd 10 mM Y-27632 to the required amount of normal mTeSR1 solution (1:1,000 dilution) to prepare an mTeSR1 solution containing 10 μM Y-27632.\nWhen the incubation and warming steps are completed, the dish or plate is tilted to aspirate and remove the excess Matrigel solution in the bottom corner.\nOnce the Matrigel solution was removed, mTeSR1 solution with Y-27632 should be dispensed to prevent desiccation.\nThaw hPSCs were stored in cryotubes at −150°C in a 37°C water bath.\nAfter thawing, move the cryotube to a hood, and transfer the solution into a conical tube containing 10 mL of normal mTeSR1 with Y-27632, using a sterile 1,000-μL tip attached to a P1000 pipette.\nCentrifuge the tube for 3 min at 300 × g.\nThe supernatant should be aspirated carefully to prevent suction of the cell pellet, 10 mL of normal mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y-27632 was added, and the cells were gently stirred, preferably by multiple bouts of suction and discharge of contents using an electronic pipette controller with a sterile serological pipette.",
    "Critical: Do not repeat pipetting more than ten times, as this may cause cell death.\nTransfer an aliquot of the solution onto dishes or plates with the planned cell density. In this experiment, cells were seeded at approximately 3.4 × 103 cells per cm2.\nNote: The volume to be transferred is in accordance with the specified split ratio of the cells, which should be selected based on the desired passaging day. If you wish to passage cells sooner, then the split ratio should be higher to allow the cells to reach sufficient confluence on the planned day of passage. In our suggestion, if you passage in 2 or 4 days, seed cells with a density of 1.7 × 104 or 3.4 × 103 per cm2, respectively. To avoid direct seeding from a high-density suspension, which may cause more variation in the initial distribution, with 6-well plates, 500 μL of medium per well was added before dispensing the diluted solution with 1.5 mL of medium containing a designated number of cells per well.\nPlace the dishes or plates in an incubator at 37°C and gently move them side-to-side to evenly spread the cells without contamination.\nNote: We recommend initial seeding of hPSCs in a conventional setting without TRP, fortifying with TRP, to allow cells to grow in an accustomed medium environment.",
    "Alternatives: If cells were already cultured on a dish or plate containing mTeSR1, change the medium to TRP-fortified mTeSR1 on the next medium change day. If cells were grown in different media, they should be initially switched to mTeSR1 medium on the day after medium change, followed by TRP-fortified mTeSR1. If the cells cultured in non-fortified mTeSR1 are already confluent and ready for passage, they should not be passaged TRP-fortified mTeSR1 with Y-27632, as TRP fortification should commence at the time of medium change. If the cells were initially passaged using conventional mTeSR1 with Y-27632, and then the medium should be then changed to TRP-fortified mTeSR1 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1598-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Flowchart guiding adjustment of hPSCs to TRP-fortified medium\nThe switch to TRP-fortified medium from conventional TRP-concentration medium was performed after hPSCs were cultured in conventional TRP-concentration medium for at least 12 h.\nMedium change of hPSCs\nTiming: 45 min\nIn this step, hPSC culture medium is changed to Y-27632 depleted TRP-fortified medium.\nNote: As with the initial culture, the following steps should be undertaken under sterile conditions, except for assessments of the cells under the microscope.\nAfter 1–2 days of incubation, place the required amount of TRP-fortified mTeSR1 solution in a conical tube covered by a shading sheet at room temperature (approximately 21°C) for approximately 30–60 min.\nObserve cells in the dish or plate microscopically.\nNote: Observation of cells should be performed under an inverted microscope regularly prior to the timing of medium change, passage, or cryopreservation, particularly to assess the morphology indicative of differentiation and the presence or absence of contamination. The microscope should be thoroughly cleaned using 70% ethanol prior to and after use.",
    "Critical: Any signs suggestive of contamination, discontinue culture, and discard all concurrently cultured dishes and plates to prevent the dissemination of contamination in the laboratory.\nTilt the dish or plate, aspirate the culture medium, and change medium to TRP-fortified mTeSR1 solution (without Y-27632). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: During medium change or passage, if possible, minimize the time of direct light exposure, which may be detrimental to cells, and reduce the light level in a sterile hood.\nPause point: Change the medium every other day with TRP-fortified mTeSR1 solution. Once cells are 60%–80% confluent, they should be passaged to facilitate maintenance of pluripotency and spontaneous differentiation. The cells were passaged on day 7.\nPassage of hPSCs\nTiming: 45–75 min\nIn this step, hPSCs in TRP-fortified medium are passaged and is seeded with planned densities.\nPrepare resources for passaging when cells are ready.\nTransfer the required volume of TRP-fortified mTeSR1 to a conical tube with 10 μM Y-27632 and keep it in a dark place at room temperature (approximately 21°C) for warming.\nPrepare Matrigel-coated dishes or plates as described previously, and replace the coating with TRP-fortified mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y-27632.\nObserve cells in the dish or plate microscopically.\nTilt the dish or plate and aspirate medium.\nWash the dish or plate gently with PBS and aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd TrypLE Select for dissociation and the dish or plate was placed in an incubator at 37°C for approximately 3 min.\nNote: The amount of TrypLE Select depends on the surface area of the dish or plate and may need to be adjusted based on confluence. We typically added 2 mL to a 10-cm dish and 500 μL per well in a 6-well plate.",
    "Alternatives: Accutase can be used as an alternative to TrypLE Select. We typically added 2 mL to a 10-cm dish and 500 μL per well in a 6-well plate.\nNote: Observe the dish or plate to ensure that the cells are well-dissociated prior to the next step. Incubate for longer periods if the cells do not dissociate.\nAdd 10 mL or 2 mL per well of TRP-fortified mTeSR1 with Y-27632 to a 10-cm dish or 6-well plate, respectively. Then, gently detach the cells, and transfer all the cell suspensions to a conical tube using an electronic pipette controller.\nAlternatives: Cells can be collected directly using a 1,000 μL pipette tip after detachment by gentle pipetting. The collected cells were promptly transferred to a tube containing 10 mL TRP-fortified StemFit AK02N with Y-27632.\nCentrifuge the tube for 3 min at 300 × g.\nAspirate the supernatant carefully to prevent suction of the cell pellet; mix 10 mL of normal mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y-27632 and gently stir cells, preferably using multiple bouts of suction; discharge contents using an electronic pipette controller with a sterile serological pipette.\nPerform a cell count using Vi-CELL XR or equivalent, and assess cell density within the sampled solution and viability.\nSeed cells onto prepared dishes or plates based on the planned cell density or split-cell ratio.\nNote: The preferred cell density depends on multiple variables, including the cell line, passage number, and adaptation to TRP-fortified medium. Several attempts are required to determine the optimal cell density or split ratio. We suggest initial seeding and culture with different cell densities using multiple dishes or plates and choose one of them that is approximately 60%–80% confluent at the time of passaging. In this experiment, 1.7 × 103 cells per cm2 of cells were seeded.",
    "Place the dishes or plates in an incubator at 37°C and gently move them side-to-side to evenly spread the cells without contamination.\nPause point: Continue culture using TRP-fortified mTeSR1 for at least two weeks to allow hPSCs to adapt to their growth environment. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCryopreservation of hPSCs\nTiming: 45–60 min\nIn this step, hPSCs in TRP-fortified medium are cryopreserved.\nCryopreservation of hPSCs is recommended when the cells are adapted to TRP-fortified medium after a few passages, allowing easier access to cells that have an increased capacity to proliferate and to efficiently commence cell culture when another culture encounters problems, such as contamination or undesirable differentiation.\nPrepare 10 mL of TRP-fortified mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y-27632 in a conical tube and keep it in the dark (the medium does not need to be warmed).\nPrepare cryotubes and record data, such as date, cell line, passage number, TRP-fortification status, cell count, and medium used before freezing.\nRepeat steps 16–21.\nCentrifuge the tube for 3 min at 300 × g.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 500 μL of STEM-CELLBANKER per 1–5 × 106 cells.\nNote: Cell density that is either too high or too low may cause decreased survival after thawing.\nGently disperse the cells by pipetting with a sterile 1,000 μL tip attached to a P1000 pipette.\nNote: The cells are very fragile at this point. Only three pipetting strokes are required to disperse the pellets. More than five strokes can decrease the viability.\nImmediately after pipetting, 500 μL of cryopreservation solution should be transferred to each of the prepared cryotubes.\nPlace the cryotubes in BICELL freezing vessels.\nStore the vessels in a −80°C freezer.\nPause point: Cryotubes should be removed from the vessels overnight (8–24 h) and stored in a freezer at −150°C for long-term preservation.",
    "Note: Frozen hPSCs can be recovered in steps 1–11, except using TRP-fortified mTeSR1 with Y-27632 as the culture medium from the start.\nEvaluation of hPSCs proliferation: Live-cell imaging\nTiming: 30–60 min\nIn this step, hPSCs are evaluated in terms of proliferation.\nIncuCyte ZOOM is used to determine proliferation rates by serially measuring the confluence for specified periods. This system enables maintenance of the ongoing culture of cells while comparing proliferation rates between TRP-fortified medium and conventional medium in an installed humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.\nTurn on IncuCyte and establish a protocol for imaging, that includes setting up the type of plates and cells, scan mode, imaging intervals, and parameters for image processing.\nRepeat steps 15–24, with the exception that plates that are compatible with the imaging system must be used instead of passaging onto 10-cm dishes.\nAfter seeding, the plates should be gently moved side-to-side to evenly spread the cells without contamination, and gently but firmly placed in the instrument tray specific to the culture vessel.\nStart imaging and change medium as required (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: Avoid opening the drawer of IncuCyte during the first 24 h of culture, as cells are more susceptible to mechanical force shortly after passage.\nWhen the acquisition protocol established during step 36 finishes, the data should be analyzed using MS-Excel.

Proliferation of hPSCs in TRP-fortified medium, related to step 39\nThe orange area indicates the area annotated by IncuCyte ZOOM.\nEvaluation of hPSCs pluripotency: Flow cytometry\nTiming: 60–90 min\nIn this step, hPSCs are evaluated in terms of pluripotency using cytometry.",
    "Flow cytometry of hPSCs cultured in TRP-fortified medium should be performed after multiple passages to assess their pluripotency using hPSCs grown in conventional medium as a control. Three antibodies (anti-REA, anti-SSEA4, and anti-TRA-1-60) were used for this assay. The Gallios flow cytometer and its software, Kaluza and FlowJo, were used for measurement and analysis.\nPrepare hPSCs that are approximately 40%–60% confluent grown on 10-cm dishes or 6-well plates.\nRepeat steps 16–21 to perform cell counts.\nTransfer the medium containing 3 × 106–6 × 106 cells per cell line to another conical tube.\nNote: When performing flow cytometry to compare pluripotency between hPSCs in TRP-fortified medium and hPSCs in conventional medium, the same number of cells should be sampled from each condition.\nCentrifuge the tube for 3 min at 300 × g.\nAspirate The supernatant and add 300 μL of a solution containing 2% FBS in PBS.\nDivide the solution into three aliquots of 100 μL each in a 1.5 mL microtube.\nAdd 10 μL of each antibody to a separate microtube.\nPause point: Place the microtubes in the dark on ice for 30 min.\nAdd 1 mL of 2% FBS to each microtube and centrifuge for 3 min at 1,250 × g (or 5 min at 300 × g).\nUsing a pipette tip, aspirate supernatant.\nAdd 500 μL of 2% FBS in PBS to each of the microtubes.\nDispense the solutions to a separate test tube by filtering them through a cell strainer cap.\nRun the flow cytometer.\nEvaluation of hPSCs pluripotency: Immunocytochemistry\nTiming: 2–3 h\nhPSCs are evaluated in terms of pluripotency using immunocytochemistry.",
    "Immunocytochemistry of hPSCs cultured in TRP-fortified medium is recommended to assess their pluripotency, and should be performed together with hPSCs grown in conventional medium as a control. Three pluripotency markers were used in this assay (OCT-4, NANOG, and SSEA4). Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for details regarding the appropriate dilution ratio for each antibody, and ensure that the secondary antibodies correspond to the primary antibodies used. The fluorescence microscope BZ-X710 and its accompanying software, BZ-X Viewer and BZ-X Analyzer, were used for analysis.\nPrepare hPSCs at 40%–60% confluency on 6-well plates.\nNote: If three pluripotency markers are tested, a minimum of three wells are required for immunocytochemistry per cell line.\nAspirate medium.\nWash with 2 mL of PBS per well and aspirate.\nFix Cells by adding 1–1.5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde per well and refrigerated at 4°C.\nPause point: Place the plates in a refrigerator at 4°C for 30–60 min.\nAspirate 4% paraformaldehyde.\nWash with 2 mL of PBS per well and aspirate (twice).\nAdd 1 mL of 0.1% Triton X-100 per well to permeabilize cells and leave at room temperature (approximately 21°C) for 1–15 min.\nAspirate 0.1% Triton X-100.\nWash with 2 mL of PBS per well, and aspirate.\nAdd approximately 1.5–2 mL of ImmunoBlock per well.\nPause point: Blocking can be performed at room temperature (approximately 21°C) for 30 min to 1 h or at 4°C overnight (8–24 h).\nDilute the primary antibodies with ImmunoBlock in separate conical tubes (1 mL per well).\nAspirate ImmunoBlock from the plates and add diluted primary antibodies.\nPause point: Place the plates in a refrigerator at 4°C overnight (8–24 h).\nPrepare the corresponding secondary antibodies diluted with ImmunoBlock in separate conical tubes (1 mL per well is required).\nWash with 5 mL of PBS per well and aspirate (twice).",
    "Add diluted secondary antibodies to the plates.\nPause point: Place the plates in the dark at room temperature (approximately 21°C) for 2 h.\nWash with 5 mL of PBS per well and aspirate (twice).\nPrepare 2 mL of 0.02 mg/mL Hoechst 33342 by mixing 1.998 mL of PBS and 0.001 mL of 10 mg/mL Hoechst 33342.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.02 mg/mL Hoechst 33342 per well and the plates were left in the dark at 20°C for 30 min.\nWash with 5 mL of PBS per well and aspirate (twice).\nAdd 1.5–2 mL of ImmunoBlock per well.\nImage cells using a fluorescence inverted microscope suitable for immunohistochemistry.\nNote: If imaging is to be performed later, the plates can be stored in the dark place at 4°C for up to one week. Wrapping with a shade sheet to minimize light exposure is recommended."
