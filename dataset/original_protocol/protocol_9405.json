  "procedures": [
    "1) Intragastric Administration of Rotenone\nWeigh the animal.\nCalculate the total volume of rotenone/vehicle solution needed. In this case 0.01 ml per gram of the animal weight.\nCharge a 1 mL syringe with the previously calculated volume of rotenone solution (0.625 mg/mL rotenone, 4% carboxymethylcellulose and 1.25% chloroform) or vehicle solution (4% carboxymethylcellulose and 1.25% chloroform). In this case it corresponds to a 5 mg/kg rotenone dose.\nPick up the mouse and, holding the mouse's tail with one hand, stretch the skin of the neck by pulling it with the first two fingers of the other hand.\nOnce the head is fixed between the two fingers, lean it against the palm of the hand and turn it upside-down.  Fix the tail using the fourth and fifth fingers.\nKeeping the head towards the back, press the palate to open the mouse's mouth. Gently introduce the gavage in the mouth. It is important to use a gavage needle and not a regular needle. Slowly, move the gavage in the direction of the stomach far enough. This will avoid material getting in the lungs.\nAdminister the rotenone solution or vehicle by gently pressing the embolus. When completed, slowly extract the gavage.\nPlace the animal back in another cage until all animals from one cage are done.\n2) Immunostaining Procedures\nFollowing treatment, mice are anesthetized using Ketamin 100 mg/kg und Xylazin 10 mg/kg i.p. and intracardially perfused with 4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS.\nThe guts are then extracted by dissection, and placed in 15% sucrose overnight.  The next day, the tissue is transferred to 30% sucrose and incubated again overnight at 4°C.\nThe tissue is then placed in Tissue-tek and stored in a -80°C freezer until use.\nUsing a cryostat, 20 micron intestine cross-sections are transferred to Superfrost slides.",
    "Blocking and immunostaining procedures using anti-βIII-tubulin and anti-alpha-synuclein antibodies are then performed as previously described 9.\n3)\tAlpha-synuclein Inclusion Image Analysis\nIt is recommended that an external person unaware of images' origin performs the analysis. Therefore, the data should be codified.  Image analysis was performed using FIJI software.\nOpen the confocal image file.  Then, split the channels so that it is possible to work on each channel independently.\nClose those channels that are not going to be use and select Analyse>Set Scale and set the Pixel size to 1.  Set the known distance to 0.13 (this will depend on the objective and the resolution used) and click on global. The size of the image will now be shown in microns.\nSelect alpha-synuclein channel and select ganglion, make sure that the selection encloses the ganglion in all slices.\nPress Image>Duplicate to duplicate the image. With the ganglion selected, only an image the size of the ganglion will be duplicated.\nPress Edit>Clear Outside. The part of the image outside the selected region will become black.\nDuplicate the image again to determine in later steps how well the procedure went. Images that have a high signal to noise to background ratio should not be used for image analysis.\nSelect Image>Adjust>Threshold and then select MaxEntropy. Then move over the slices in the cropped image and the original one to ensure that the procedure went well. The entropic threshold selects an intensity signal level based on the image histogram and only those pixels with intensities higher than this threshold will be displayed in a white over black image.\nSelect Process, then click on Smooth. This step transforms the pixeled edges of the images in smooth edges.",
    "Select Process, then click on Binary, and choose Make Binary. The image will be displayed as a black over white image.\nDuplicate image to perform next step on the duplicated image.\nClick on Analyze>Analyze particles. Then select Show:Outlines and click on Summarize. The rest of settings should be leaved in default. This function recognizes the total number of pixels with a signal and those that are grouped together. The total surface of pixels with signal plus the number of groups of pixels and the mean size are reported.\nCompare and select the largest slice that adjusts well. The slice will be marked.\nCopy the data table with the total alpha-synuclein surface, the number of inclusions and the mean particle size.  Paste the data into an excel spreadsheet or annotated elsewhere.\nReturn to FIJI and find the previously selected slice in the β-tubulin channel, and select it.\nSelect ganglion area and click on Analyze then select Measure. Another table will appear showing the total surface of the ganglion.\nExtract the data from the table to the excel sheet near the alpha-synuclein measurement or copy it down elsewhere.\nUsing excel, divide the different parameters obtained in the alpha-synuclein measurement by the ganglion surface to obtain total alpha-synuclein surface and inclusion number normalized by ganglion size.\n4) Representative Results",
    "When gavage administration protocol is performed correctly the inconveniences for the animal are minimal. Treatment using this concentration of rotenone enables a local effect of rotenone on the ENS without rotenone levels in blood and no inhibition of muscle or brain mitochondrial Complex I even after 1.5 months of treatment (see Figure 1). If image analysis is performed correctly a rigorous analysis of alpha-synuclein pattern should be possible. It gives reliable data on the total amount of alpha-synuclein (total surface), alpha-synuclein pattern in the cell (number of inclusions) and the presence of alpha-synuclein inclusions (inclusion size) (Figure 2).\n imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2123/2123fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Mice were divided in three groups (n=3) and treated with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg rotenone (n=3), 300 μL of blood was extracted 1, 2 and 3 hours after rotenone administration and pooled together for HPLC analysis. C, mice were treated for one week once a day with 5 (n=3), 10 (n=3) and 20 (n=1) mg/kg rotenone, brain and brainstem were extracted 1 and 2 hours after last administration and prepared for HPLC analysis.

A, B, C, anti βIII-tubulin, alpha-synuclein and DAPI staining in duodenum (B) and ileum (A,C) sections. Arrow in B, 1.5 months treatment induced an increased alpha-synuclein punctate pattern inside enteric nervous system ganglia when compared to 3 months controls (A). Arrow in C, 3 months treatment induced formation of larger alpha-synuclein inclusions (ø>6 μm). D, immunofluorescence staining using anti-alpha-synuclein, Thioflavine S and DAPI. Arrow in D, only 3 month treated mice showed aggregation of these larger alpha-synuclein accumulations. E, E', E'', image analysis quantification steps.
