    "Protocol 1 describes the method for preparing dECM from porcine skin. The procedure begins with 50-100 g of skin from pig belly, which can be obtained from a local butcher or abattoir, and it requires 7-10 days to complete. An overall summary of the workflow is shown in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.393#cpz1393-fig-0001], and it is recommended that the entire protocol is reviewed carefully before beginning. Decellularization involves removal of the epidermis with the enzyme Dispase, followed by combined Trypsin and detergent treatment to remove the cells of the dermis. The decellularized dermal tissue is then freeze-dried and solubilized with Pepsin to yield a 20 mg/ml solution of dECM. The dECM can be portioned into small aliquots and stored at −20°C for up to 1 year. Note: an initial starting mass of 50-100 g (20 × 10 cm) of porcine skin can be expected to produce approximately 500 ml of soluble dECM.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6f0cf65c-c795-405d-a14d-6e982def284e/cpz1393-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nOverview of the porcine skin decellularized ECM protocol. (1) Fresh porcine abdomen skin was trimmed of fat and hair before being cut into 1 × 1 cm pieces. (2-3) Enzymatic dissociation of the epithelium was performed with Dispase II (50 U/L) followed by mechanical delamination of the epidermis. (4) Decellularization was achieved by trypsinization (0.25%/0.1% EDTA) and washes with a Triton-X 100 Tris Buffer solution (0.26% EDTA, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.69% Tris). (5) Enzymatic digestion of the dermis was performed by pepsin (1 mg/ml) digestion to produce tissue at a 20 mg/ml concentration. (6) The dECM hydrogel is gelled once neutralized with one-tenth of the digest volume of 1 N NaOH and one-ninth of the digest volume of 10× PBS and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr.\nMaterials\nPig skin (Local butcher, pork belly skin, 50-100 g)\nPBS (ThermoFisher, P4417)\nPenicillin-Streptomycin (Pen/Strep, ThermoFisher, 15140122)\nNaAc (Sigma-Aldrich, S8750)",

In a biological safety cabinet, rinse the fresh porcine skin with 70% ethanol and PBS. All subsequent steps should be carried out under sterile conditions\n2. Cut the skin into small pieces of approximately 1 × 1 cm using scalpels, and remove as much fat and hair as possible.\nChange scalpels once each of them becomes dull. Surgical scissors can also be used.\n3. Soak the skin in PBS supplemented with 1% Pen/Strep for 5 min.\n4. Pour away the dPBS/PenStrep solution and transfer the skin pieces into 50-ml centrifuge tubes.\n5. Weigh the skin in each tube and aim for approximately 25-40 g (100 pieces) per tube.\nRecord the empty tube weight to assist with measuring the dry weight on day 2.\n6. Freeze the skin at −80°C until completely frozen (approximately 4-5 hr or overnight).\n7. Freeze-dry the skin overnight within the lyophilizer with the caps of the tubes loosened or covered with parafilm with holes in it.\nEfficient removal of the water by sublimation in the lyophilizer requires the tissue to be completely frozen beforehand (step 6).\nDay 2",
    "8. Reweigh the freeze-dried tubes and determine the dry tissue mass.\nDry tissue mass = [Mass of the tube with dried tissue] – [Mass of the empty tube from step 5]\n9. Prepare the Dispase II solution at a final concentration of 560 U/L and make enough for 2 ml of Dispase solution per gram of dry skin.\n10. To the same tubes, add 2 ml of Dispase solution for every gram of freeze-dried skin. Do not exceed 40 ml in each tube to allow space for stirring.\n11. Seal the tubes and place them on a roller, similar to the one listed above, on medium speed at 4°C overnight.\nDay 3\n12. After approximately 12-16 hr incubation in Dispase, transfer the skin to a sterile petri dish in a biological safety cabinet. Gently scrape off the epidermis from each piece of skin with tweezers.\n13. Wash the dermis three times with sterile water.\n14. Wash the dermis again with 70% ethanol in a sterile 500-ml glass bottle overnight at room temperature with continuous mixing on a stir plate.\nDay 4\n15. Transfer the dermis to a clean, sterile bottle. Cover the dermis with 0.25% trypsin and incubate for 1 hr on a 40°C hot plate with stirring.\nAlternatively, a 37°C incubator can be used instead of the hot plate.\n16. Wash the dermis three times with sterile water and pour off the excess.\n17. Prepare a decellularization solution of 1% Triton-X-100, 0.25% EDTA, and 0.69% Tris (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.393#cpz1393-rec-0004]). Add enough of the solution to cover the tissue and incubate for 6 hr at room temperature with continuous stirring.\n18. Replace the solution with fresh Triton/EDTA/Tris solution and incubate overnight at room temperature with stirring.\nDay 5\n19. Wash the dermis three times with sterile water.",
    "20. Transfer the dermis to new sterile 50-ml centrifuge tubes and freeze at −80°C.\nThis step can be over the weekend. Note the weight of the empty tubes for calculating the dry tissue mass.\nDay 6\n21. Freeze-dry the tissue overnight in the lyophilizer with loosened caps or cover with parafilm with poked holes.\nAs noted above, ensure the tissue is completely frozen before the freeze-drying process\nDay 7\n22. Prepare pepsin solubilization solution by dissolving 600 mg Pepsin in 600 ml of 0.01 M HCl. Filter sterilize.\n23. Reweigh the tubes and determine the mass of dry tissue. Transfer the dry tissue to a sterile glass bottle and add 1 ml of the Pepsin solution for every 20 mg of freeze-dried tissue.\nThis step will result in a final dECM concentration of 20 mg/ml, which we find works well for HSEs, but the concentration can be adjusted based on the final application.\n24. Incubate at room temperature on a magnetic stirrer for 3 days or until all tissue is fully dissolved.\n25. Prepare 10 ml aliquots of the dECM and store them at −20°C for up to 1 year.",
    "This protocol describes how to construct three-dimensional (3D) HSEs using the dECM materials as the dermal support matrix. The procedure involves embedding human dermal fibroblasts in neutralized dECM, forming a soft gel at 37°C. Human keratinocytes are then seeded on the surface and cultured at the air-liquid interface to form a stratified and differentiated epidermal layer over 14 days. We recommend using the dECM at a concentration of 20 mg/ml, but this can be adjusted to modify the density or stiffness of the dermal matrix as desired.\nMaterials\nFrozen aliquot of dECM (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.393#cpz1393-prot-0001])\n10 × PBS (ThermoFisher, 70011044)\nNaOH (Sigma Aldrich, S5881)\nFAD medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.393#cpz1393-rec-0002])\nAscorbic acid (Sigma Aldrich, A92902)\nPrimary human dermal fibroblasts (isolated from neonatal skin) (Rikken, Niehues, & van den Bogaard, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.393#cpz1393-bib-0020])\nHuman keratinocytes (primary isolated from neonatal or adult skin or immortalized lines) (Rikken, Niehues, & van den Bogaard, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.393#cpz1393-bib-0020])\n12-well plates (ThermoFisher, Nunc 150628)\n12-well transwell inserts, 0.4-mm PTFE (Merck Millipore, MCHT12H48)\nCloning rings (Bel-Art, 378470300)\nCell culture incubator, 37°C, 5% CO2 (ThermoFisher, Heracell, 11666310)\nPreparing the gel-fibroblast mix\n1. Thaw the required volume of dECM at 4°C for 3-4 hr and place on ice until use. Prepare enough dECM for 340 μl per HSE plus 10% excess for wastage.\n2. Prepare a cell suspension of primary human dermal fibroblast cells at 1 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% pen/strep. Prepare enough cells for 3.4 × 104 fibroblasts per HSE.\n3. Combine the dECM with one-tenth the final volume of 1N NaOH and one-ninth the final volume of 10× PBS, then add in one-tenth the final volume of the cell suspension.\nMix gently with a 1-ml pipette by stirring WITHOUT pipetting up and down to prevent bubbles.",
    "The final fibroblast density will be 1 × 105 cells/ml.\nCasting the fibroblast embedded dECM gels\n4. Place Transwell inserts in each well of the 12-well plate.\n5. Add 340 μl of the gel and fibroblast mix to the center of each Transwell insert.\n6. Incubate in a sterile 37°C incubator for at least 1 hr to set. Keratinocyte can be added immediately after the gel is set or up to 24 hr later.\n7. After the gel has set, gently insert a cloning ring with the larger opening facing up and the smaller opening on the gel side.\nSeeding keratinocytes onto the dECM surface\n8. Prepare a cell suspension of human keratinocytes in complete FAD medium at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml.\nThe seeding density may need to be optimized for different keratinocyte lines, but 1 × 106 cells/ml is recommended for primary keratinocytes and the NTERT keratinocyte line (Dickson et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.393#cpz1393-bib-0005]).\n9. Into the center of each gel enclosed within the cloning ring, add 100 μl of the cell suspension drop by drop.\nThe cloning ring helps keep the keratinocytes on the surface of the gel and prevents the cell suspension from running down the side.\n10. To the cell suspension, add 100 μl of FAD medium.\n11. Add 500 μl of FAD medium to the bottom of the well. Add the medium slowly down the side of the well to avoid generating bubbles.\nThis should be enough to cover the bottom of the insert but not go over the sides into the middle of the insert. At this point, there will be 200 μl in the insert and 500 μl in the lower well, 700 μl in total.\n12. Place the plate in a 37°C incubator overnight.\nRaising HSE cultures to the air-liquid interface",
    "13. After 24 hr of submerged culture, the HSEs are raised to the air-liquid interface. First, carefully remove the cloning ring from each HSE with sterile tweezers.\n14. Gently remove the medium from the insert by pipetting and replace the medium in the bottom well with 500 μl of fresh FAD medium. The air-liquid interface is created by leaving the top of the insert exposed to the air, while the bottom remains in contact with the medium in the well through the insert membrane.\n15. Culture the gels at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 14 days, replacing the medium in the bottom well every day.\n16. Starting on day 8 of the culture, begin supplementing the FAD medium with 50 μg/ml of fresh ascorbic acid (vitamin C). This step encourages collagen deposition and stabilization of the dermal matrix in the later stages of the culture period.\n17. At the end of the culture period, HSEs can be fixed with paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and processed for histology and immunofluorescence using standard protocols (Schacht & Kern, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.393#cpz1393-bib-0021]).\nThe HSEs will be more fragile than normal skin and should be handled gently. They can be removed from the insert by cutting out the membrane with a scalpel and carefully peeling the membrane off the HSE."
