    "1. Software installation\nRevMan software installation\n\t\nGo to RevMan's official website (see Table of Materials), and according to the configuration of the computer system, select the compatible software version, and download it in the form of an exe file.\nDouble-click to run the exe file: Next > Select the appropriate installation path > Next > Finish.\nEndNote software installation\n\t\nGo to EndNote's official website (see Table of Materials) to download the installation package compatible with the computer's version as a ZIP file.\nDecompress the ZIP file within a local folder. Double-click to start the installer.\nConfigure the installation options: Next > Welcome to Endnote X9 > I would like a 30-day free trail > Next > I accept the license agreement > Next > Typical > Next > Finish.\n2. Literature search and screening\nCreate the retrieval strategy. Determine the search terms according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The details of the retrieval strategy for this study are provided in Supplementary File 1.\nPerform a literature search through various databases (common databases: Pubmed, CBM, Web of Science, CNKI, Cochrane Library, VIP, Embase, and Wan fang; see Table of Materials). Take PubMed as an example:\n\t\nGo to the PubMed database website.\nEnter the retrieval strategy based on the Pubmed search rules.",
    "NOTE: In this study, the query might be (\"insomnia\" OR \"restlessness\" OR \"sleeplessness\" OR \"wakefulness\" OR \"inability to sleep\") AND (\"Medicine, Chinese Traditional\" OR \"Traditional Chinese Medicine\" OR \"Zhong Yi Xue\" OR \"Chinese Traditional Medicine\" OR \"Chinese patent medicine\" OR \"Shugan Jieyu Capsules\"). In this query, the operator \"AND\" indicates that the studies must have all the keywords, the operator \"OR\" indicates that the studies must have at least one of the keywords, and the parentheses indicate the order of these logical operations. The literature search time for this study was up to February 21, 2022 (Supplementary Figure 1A).\nDownload all the retrieved literature: Save > PubMed > Create file (Supplementary Figure 1B).\nPerform the literature screening.\n\tNOTE: Take Pubmed as an example using Endnote.\n\t\nImport the retrieved literature: File > Import > Options > Import Options > PubMed (NLM) > Import (Supplementary Figure 2A).\nCreate inclusion and exclusion groups: My Groups > Create group set or Create group. For example, the exclusion groups contain inappropriate interventions, inappropriate patients, duplication of literature, etc. (Supplementary Figure 2B).\nRemove the duplicates: All References > References > Find Duplicates > Cancel. Then, all the duplicate literature is selected. Drag all the selected documents to the left side of the \"Trash\" to exclude them. After automatically eliminating the duplicate literature, manually check again to eliminate any duplicate literature (Supplementary Figure 2C).\nFor literature screening, firstly, read the titles and abstracts of the studies to delete any that do not meet the inclusion criteria, and then further read the full texts to determine whether each study is included.\nConsider performing a manual search of the referenced works in the selected studies to increase the search's exhaustiveness.",
    "Consider reaching out to the corresponding authors of the literature to request any missing or unclear data to maximize study inclusion and avoid uncertainty in the data collection.\n\tNOTE: The literature search and screening must be performed by two or more independent researchers. Final decisions should be made after discussion, or a third researcher must judge in the case of disagreement.\nUse Microsoft Word to create a PRISMA flowchart44 documenting the number of studies retrieved or excluded for each reason (Supplementary File 2).\n3. Data extraction\nCreate an Excel extraction spreadsheet containing a list of specific information to be extracted for each literature. For example, this information could include the first author, year of publication, sample size (experimental group/control group), gender, patient age, intervention, duration of treatment, and medication use in the experimental and control groups.\nEnsure that two reviewers independently conduct the data extraction and make the final decision after discussion or after a judgment by a third researcher when there is disagreement.\nSummarize the outcome indicators that reflect the effectiveness and safety of the treatment of insomnia with Shugan Jieyu capsules in the two groups. Extract the sample size and composition ratio for the outcome indicators of dichotomous variables; however, extract the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables.\n\t​NOTE: When two or more included studies mention the same outcome index, extract the specific data of that outcome index. For example, this could include the total clinical effectiveness rate, PSQI score, adverse effects, etc.\n4. Risk of bias assessment and quality of evidence\nUse the Cochrane Risk Assessment Manual45 to evaluate the risk of bias (RoB) of the included literature.",
    "Divide the evaluation grades into unclear, low, and high risk based on seven aspects: random sequence generation, blinding of participants and personnel, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, blinding of outcome assessment, selective reporting45, and other biases (other biases refer to the potential risk of bias in the included studies, such as in relation to the age of the participants, co-interventions, etc.).\nProduce quality evaluation charts.\n\t\nCreate a new file. Open the RevMan software: File > New > Next, and then select an appropriate type of systematic evaluation: systematic evaluation > Intervention review > fill in the title > Next > Full review > Finish (Supplementary Figure 3A).\nAdd the included literature: Studies and references > References to studies > Included studies > Add Study (Supplementary Figure 3B). Enter the study ID (e.g., Xiao Juan 2017)24.\nEnter the quality evaluation results: Tables > Characteristics of studies > Characteristics of included studies. Select the literature to be evaluated, and enter the evaluation result and basis for each item (Supplementary Figure 3C).\n\t\tNOTE: If the RoB is \"Unclear risk\", enter \"Unclear risk\" in the text box after it; otherwise, it cannot be displayed in the quality evaluation chart.\nCreate a graph of the RoB: Figures > Add Figure > Risk of bias graph or Risk of bias summary > Save (Supplementary Figure 4A).\nUse the GRADE guidelines46 to assess the quality of evidence, and generate a summary sheet in which the results of each study included in the meta-analysis are classified based on evidence quality.",
    "NOTE: The overall quality is downgraded according to five factors (risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, inconsistency, and publication bias) and upgraded according to three factors (large effect size, negative bias, and dose-effect relationships). The GRADE guidelines classify the quality of evidence as high, medium, low, and very low, reflecting the degree of confidence that the effect estimates are correct.\nEnsure that two reviewers independently assess the risk of bias and quality of the evidence and that disagreements are resolved by discussion or by an adjudicator.\n5. Meta-analysis\nStart the meta-analysis by using RevMan software: Data and analyses > Add Comparison, then add a comparison and enter the name of the control group > Finish.\nAdd the outcome indicators: Add Outcome > select the variable type (\"Dichotomous\" for dichotomous variables; \"Continuous\" for continuous variables) > Next, and then enter the outcome indicators (e.g., \"Total clinical effectiveness\", \"PSQI overall score\") > Finish (Supplementary Figure 4B).\nAdd the study data: Add Study Data, then select the literature > Finish (Supplementary Figure 5A).\nCreate forest plots47: Enter the extracted data > FE or RE > Forest Plot (Supplementary Figure 5B).\n\tNOTE: Due to the non-homogeneity of the population and intervention, random effect models were used to combine all the effect sizes in this study.\nSubscription Required.
