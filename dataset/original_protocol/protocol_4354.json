    "Construction of pCymMV-Gateway plasmid DNADNA fragments for silenced target gene for insertion into pCymMV-Gateway vector (Figure 1A) is obtained by PCR amplification with oligonucleotide primers containing 29-nt attB recombination site in both ends (see Note 1). Purify attB-PCR products by using a gel extraction kit.Insert target gene fragment into pCymMV-Gateway vector by using BP recombination reaction (Figure 1B).In a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube at room temperature mix attB-PCR product (150 ng), pCymMV-Gateway vector (150 ng), and 4 µl of 5x BP ClonaseTM reaction buffer. Then add 1x TE buffer (pH 8.0) until a total volume of 16 µl is obtained.Remove the BP ClonaseTM enzyme mix from -80 °C storage and put in ice for 2 min to thaw and vortex briefly twice (2 sec each time).Add 4 µl of BP ClonaseTM enzyme mix to each reaction (step A2a, above). Mix well by vortexing twice and then microcentrifuge briefly. Store BP ClonaseTM enzyme mix at -80 °C immediately after usage.Incubate reactions at 25 °C for 60 min.Add 2 µl of the Proteinase K solution to each sample to terminate the reaction.Vortex briefly and incubate samples at 37 °C for 10 min.Transform competent E. coli with the pCymMV-Gateway vector for amplification (in the Laminar flow cabinet).Incubate TOP10 E. coli competent cells on ice for 10 min (see Note 2).Add 5 µl of each BP reaction (step A2) into 50-100 µl of TOP10 E. coli competent cells.Incubate on ice for 15 min. Heatshock cells by incubating at 42 °C water bath for 45 sec. Incubate on ice for 2 min.Add 200 µl of LB medium and incubate at 37 °C for 60 min while shaking at 200 rpm.Spread each transformation (305 µl) onto LB-agar medium plates containing 50 µg/ml of Kanamycin.Incubate at 37 °C for 13 h.",
    "Randomly select two to four colonies for each construct, and then subculture.Recover and purify the plasmids.Confirm each construct by PCR with the gene-specific forward primer and the    general    reverse    primer    (CymMV 5351, 5′-CTTCTGTACCATACACATAG-3′) on the gateway vector.Transformation by electroporation after amplification of the recombined pCymMV-Gateway vector (steps B1-3 in the Laminar flow cabinet)Thaw the Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain EHA105) competent cells at room temperature and immediately place on ice. Transfer 100 μl of the competent cells to a chilled electroporation cuvette on ice. Add 1-2 μl of recombined pCymMV-Gateway vector (150 ng of plasmid DNA can be used depending on the competence of the cells), mix gently and keep on ice.Perform the electroporation.Insert the cuvettes in the electroporation chamber and initiate the electroporation. The voltage and pulse time parameters are pre-set.Immediately add 200 μl of LB medium in the cuvettes and transfer the solution to a sterile Eppendorf tube.Incubate the mixture at 28 °C  for 30 min. while shaking at 200 rpm.Spread all the mixture on selected LB-agar medium plate containing 100 μM of Acetosyringone and 50 µg/ml of Kanamycin and incubate at 28 °C for 16 h.Confirm each colony by PCR with the gene-specific forward primer and the general    reverse    primer (CymMV 5351, 5′-CTTCTGTACCATACACATAG-3′) on the gateway vector for the presence of the modified constructs.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180107/20180107193937_5411.jpgFigure 1.

    "Agro-infiltration of Phalaenopsis plantsPrepare electroporation competent Agrobacterium cells:Four days prior to infection, transfer a single colony of Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing recombinant plasmids into 5 ml of LB medium containing 100 μM of Acetosiringone and 50 µg/ml of kanamycin and culture at 28 °C for 16 h while shaking at 200 rpm. Subculture the bacterial cell in 50 ml of LB medium containing 100 μM of Acetosiringone and 50 µg/ml of kanamycin and incubate at 28 °C for 13-16 h while shaking at 200 rpm until OD600 reaches 0.8-1.0 (about 3-5 h). To harvest, transfer the culture to 50 ml centrifuge bottles and centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C 3,000 x g. From this step the cells should be kept cold throughout the preparation.After centrifugation, remove as much of the supernatant as possible. Resuspend cell pellets by adding 300 µl of MS medium containing 100 µM of Acetosyringone. It is allowed to stand at room temperature for 0.5 hours without shaking before agro-infiltration.Infiltrate 100 µl of Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing recombined pCymMV Gateway vector in virus-free Phalaenopsis plants by use of a 1-ml syringe with a needle (see Note 3).Perform infiltration using either one of the two methods (Figures 2 and 3):For leaf injection, inject suspensions into the abaxial side of blade or laminar regions but excluding form tip, base, midrib, and margin parts of the leaf (usually the third youngest leaf for Phalaenopsis) right above the inflorescence emerge (Figure 2, left panel and Figure 3A).For inflorescence injection, inject suspensions into the floral stalk (Figure 2, right panel and Figure 3B) of the raceme with eight internodes and one visible floral bud (extruding out of its bract). The raceme stalk usually emerges from the stem between the third and the fourth leaves.",
    "After injection, the injection areas become dark green under the epidermal surface than the un-injected ones (Figure 3C-D).Plants after injected should be grown back in stable and regular growth condition in an insect-proof and thermal-controlled (20-25 °C) greenhouse.Agro-infiltrated inflorescences bloom with the first blooming flower appearing on 31-35 days post Agro-infiltration.Confirm Agrobacterium infiltration, virus movement and silencing of transgene expression by PCR (see Note 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141217/20141217231434_6244.jpgFigure 2.
