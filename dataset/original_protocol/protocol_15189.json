    "1. Pre-procedure Preparation\nPrior to performing the procedure, discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient, and obtain a signed consent form. Adjust the patient's vitamin K antagonist dose to achieve an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. Continue antiarrhythmic drug therapy up to the time of the procedure.\nEither the day before or the day of the procedure, perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to document the absence of thrombi within the LAA, assess the features and type of the LAA, and to determine the appropriate WATCHMAN device size to implant (see the 2012 JoVE article by Mobius-Winkler and colleagues for more information)22.\nPerform the combined catheter ablation and WATCHMAN LAA Closure Device placement procedure in an electrophysiology lab with the appropriate diagnostic and imaging equipment for the procedure.\nWith the patient in the supine position, administer anaesthesia according to institutional protocols.\n2. Catheter Ablation\nEnsure that the electrophysiological recording system (Bard Inc., Lowell, MA) is using filter settings of 100 to 500 kHz and a signal amplification of 5,000.\nOnce the patient is fully anesthetized, administer 20 ml of 1% lidocaine as a local anesthetic in the groin region. Immediately, clean and prep the inguinal region for cannulation.\nLocate the femoral vein, and insert a venous 8 French (8F) sheath. Introduce a quadripolar catheter into the coronary sinus for pacing purposes. Then, insert a long guidewire, and remove the sheath. Introduce a standard venous transseptal access sheath.\nRemove the long guidewire, and insert a Transseptal RF Brockenbrough needle (Baylis Medical Company Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) with a 12.5F-outer-diameter/9.5F-inner-diameter steerable sheath (Channel, Bard, Lowell, MA) and perform a transseptal puncture.\nAfter crossing the interatrial septum, position a pigtail catheter in the center of the left atrium and perform a 3D rotational angiography.",
    "The Pulmonary Vein Ablation Catheter (PVAC: Medtronic/Ablation Frontiers, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) is a 9F, over-the-wire, circular, decapolar mapping and ablation catheter with a 25-mm-diameter array at the distal tip. No additional nonfluoroscopic guiding or steering systems were used. The PVAC has ten electrodes on a nitinol frame that enable mapping, ablation and verification of pulmonary vein isolation. Insert a 0.032-inch guidewire into the PVAC.\nNext, insert the whole system into the venous sheath. The information gathered by the PVAC is displayed on a monitor to generate a 3D image of the patient's heart with the catheter's location displayed.\nDeliver a bolus of 10.000IE heparin to prevent clotting as a result of the procedure. Position the wire in one of the branches of the pulmonary vein, then advance the PVAC into the pulmonary vein antrum.\nUse fluoroscopic guidance, electrograms, and 3D electric signal imaging (ESI) reconstruction to assess the position of the PVAC and adjust it to get the best contact with all of the electrodes.\nOnce a satisfying catheter position is achieved, commence radio frequency (RF)-ablation by selecting the appropriate electrode pairs for delivery of RF energy.\nSet the generator to adjust the power to achieve a target temperature of 60 °C for each electrode in the selected pairs. In most cases, all electrodes pairs will be activated during the first applications to create overlapping lesion rings.\nAblate for 60 sec. Check the monitor for conditions during ablation. If the temperature does not rise above 50 °C within 15 sec, discontinue the application, adjust the position of the electrodes and start again.\nMove and rotate the PVAC-catheter to create circumferential pulmonary vein lesions.\nRepeat this procedure for all pulmonary veins.\nAfter creating circumferential lesions for all pulmonary veins, restore sinus rhythm by direct current cardioversion (DCCV).",
    "Confirm isolation by checking the absence of local potentials (entrance and exit block) with PVAC mapping inside each vein combined with pacing maneuvers from the coronary sinus.\nFor residual potentials on isolated electrode pairs, target ablation only on that and adjacent pairs to facilitate reaching target temperature.\n3. Implantation of the WATCHMAN Device\nOnce the catheter ablation procedure is complete, the WATCHMAN device is implanted.\nAdvance a 0.035\" stiff guidewire (e.g. Amplatz Super stiff 260 cm) into the PVAC and position the guidewire in the left upper pulmonary vein. Remove the PVAC while maintaining the position of the guidewire.\nIf ablation was not performed prior to implantation, administer heparin at 100 IU/kg bodyweight to obtain an activated clotting time of 200-300 sec. Check the activated clotting time level to ensure that it is still 200-250 sec. Continue to monitor this every 30 min as needed.\nRemove the WATCHMAN Access System and dilator from the packaging under sterile conditions. Carefully inspect it for damage.\nFill a 60CC syringe with saline and flush the side port of the WATCHMAN access sheath. Use the remaining saline to flush the dilator. Insert the dilator into the WATCHMAN access sheath.\nAdvance the WATCHMAN access sheath and dilator over the guidewire into the left atrium. As the WATCHMAN access sheath nears the center of the left atrium, hold the dilator and advance the WATCHMAN access sheath to the initial position of the left atrium only.\nRemove the dilator and guidewire. Before tightening the hemostasis valve, allow back bleed to minimize the potential for introducing air. Flush WATCHMAN access sheath with saline.\nTighten the valve on the access sheath.\nTo confirm the LAA dimensions, use TEE to measure the maximum LAA dimensions in 4 views at 0 °, 45 °, 90 ° and 135 °.",
    "Flush the pigtail catheter with saline and advance it over the wire and through the WATCHMAN access sheath. Then, remove the guidewire and connect a syringe with contrast dye to the pigtail.\nWhile viewing TEE, turn the WATCHMAN access sheath counterclockwise to align the sheath more anterior and advance the pigtail in the desired position in the distal portion of the LAA.\nOnce the pigtail catheter has reached the LAA, obtain angiography at a right anterior oblique (RAO) of 20-30 °, caudal 20-30 °. Then perform TEE with a minimum of a 0-135 ° sweep. This is most important when the sheath is advanced near the wall or apex of the LAA and while advancing more distally in any anatomy.\nCarefully advance the access sheath over the pigtail catheter in the most superior lobe: in angiography this is the LAA-lobe situated around 2 o'clock at a right anterior oblique (RAO) of 20-30 °, caudal 20-30 °, in TEE it is the most right LAA-lobe at 135 °.\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance, advance the WATCHMAN access sheath to the desired depth in the LAA based on the marker band corresponding to the appropriate size.\nOnce the pigtail is as distal as possible, inject the contrast dye.\nSelect the appropriate WATCHMAN device size based on maximum LAA ostium dimensions and sizing 22.\nUnder sterile conditions, remove the WATCHMAN device from the packaging inspect it for damage. To confirm the device is attached to the core wire, open the hemostatic valve and retract the device approximately 1 cm.\nAlign the distal tip of the device with the marker band. The WATCHMAN device should not protrude.",
    "Attach a large 60 cc syringe containing saline. Flush the system several times to remove any air. Then, submerge the tip of the delivery catheter in saline and tap it to remove bubbles.\nRecheck the position of the access sheath by angiography. Loosen the access sheath valve and slowly remove the pigtail catheter from the sheath. Allow the sheath to back bleed.\nTo avoid introducing air, inject saline through the flush port so that it drips from the delivery catheter, then, introduce the WATCHMAN device system.\nUnder fluoroscopic guidance, slowly advance the delivery catheter into the access sheath until the most distal marker band on the access sheath lines up with the marker band on the delivery catheter and stabilize the delivery catheter.\nRetract the access sheath and snap it onto the delivery catheter. Using fluoroscopy, reconfirm position of the delivery catheter tip. Do not advance the access sheath once the delivery system has been snapped into it.\nIf repositioning is required, remove the delivery system, reinsert the pigtail catheter and advance the access sheath into the proper position.\nOnce the delivery system is positioned, loosen the valve on the WATCHMAN delivery catheter. Observe the distal end of device to ensure that no forward advancement or repositioning relative to ostium occurs.\nThen, to deploy the device, hold the deployment knob stationary and slowly retract the access sheath/delivery catheter assembly with a slow stable motion over a period of 3-5 sec.\nWithdraw the access sheath/delivery catheter assembly a few centimeters from the device to align it with the LAA, leaving the core wire attached.\nOnce the device has been deployed, inject contrast again. Then, using fluoroscopy and TEE, confirm the Position, Anchor, Size and Seal (PASS) device release criteria have been met as follows:",
    "Position: Confirm the device is properly positioned by ensuring that the plane of maximum diameter of the device spans the LAA ostium and is at or just distal to the orifice of the LAA.\nAnchor: Confirm the device is anchored in place, by withdrawing the access sheath/delivery catheter assembly 1 - 2 cm from the face of the device then gently retracting and releasing the deployment knob. The LAA and device should move in unison.\nSize: Confirm that the device is appropriately sized by measuring the plane of the maximum diameter of the device using TEE in the standard 4 views 0 °, 45 °, 90 °, and 135 °, ensuring the threaded insert is visible. The device should be 80-92% of the original size.\nSeal: using color Doppler, ensure that all of the lobes distal to device are sealed. Color flow should not be detected near the device. If there is a gap or jet around the device that is larger than 5 mm, the device should be repositioned or fully recaptured and replaced.\nIf all release criteria are met, move the access sheath/delivery catheter up to the face of the device and rotate the deployment knob 3-5 turns counterclockwise to release.\nAfter release, perform angiography with contrast dye to document that the device is still in place. Then, using TEE, recheck the size and seal. Remove the sheath assembly from the left atrium.\nIf the device is too distal or proximal in the LAA or the device criteria are not met, it may be necessary to partially or fully recapture the device (for details please see the 2012 JoVE article by Möbius-Winkler and colleagues)22.\n4. Post-procedure",
    "Once proper placement of the device has been confirmed, remove the sheath. The femoral vein should then be compressed for a few hours and the patient should be carefully monitored for at least 6 hr with blood pressure and heart rate monitoring.\nCheck for hematoma and/or bleeding at regular intervals according to institutional guidelines. The patient should be administered antibiotic prophylaxis per the American Heart Association's guidelines. NOTE: Post procedure heparin is not recommended.\nOnce the patient is awake, perform a neurological examination.\nThe patient should remain on warfarin and 81 mg aspirin for a minimum of 45 days after the implant procedure (internal normalized ratio = 2.0-3.0).\nThe patient should be hospitalized overnight and discharged the next day. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or chest x-ray may be performed to confirm the absence of pericardial effusion.\nAt 45 days, assess the WATCHMAN device placement using TEE. Cessation of warfarin is at physician discretion, if the LAA is closed completely and thrombus on the device was ruled out. If flow is noted around the device greater than 5 mm, consideration should be given to keep the patient on warfarin until it has decreased to less than 5 mm.\nPatients ceasing warfarin should begin 75 mg clopidogrel daily through 6 months post-implant and continue taking aspirin daily indefinitely.\nPrescribe the appropriate endocarditis prophylaxis for 6 months following implantation. Continuing endocarditis prophylaxis beyond 6 months is at physician discretion."
