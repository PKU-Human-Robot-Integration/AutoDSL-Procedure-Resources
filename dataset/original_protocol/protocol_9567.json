    "This protocol was approved by the UMD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Tissues from 7 to 9-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were used for these studies. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Manual dissociation\nNOTE: This step is adapted from Maisel K. et al.7.\nRemove dissected tissue and place it in cold cell culture media with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nChop the tissue using sharp dissection scissors until fragments are smaller than 1 mm in any dimension.\nTransfer the minced tissue to a 15 mL conical tube and add 5 mL of media.\nAdd digestion enzymes based on the tissue and cell types being isolated. For the presented experiments, use Collagenase 4 (1 mg/mL), Collagenase D (1 mg/mL), and DNase (40 µg/mL).\nIncubate on a shaker or rocker for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle agitation throughout the incubation. Pipette the sample up and down 100 times.\nAdd EDTA to achieve a sample volume with a 5 mM concentration. Pipette the sample up and down 100 times, and then vigorously pipette the sample up and down 100 times.\nPass the sample through a 70 µm cell strainer and collect it in a 50 mL or 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the collected cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant using a pipette and resuspend cells in 1 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature.\nNeutralize the lysis buffer by adding 9 mL of cold 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS).\nCentrifuge the collected cells again at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant using a pipette and resuspend cells in the desired buffer or media.\n2. Semi-automated mechanical dissociation",
    "Place dissected tissue in cold cell culture media with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\n\tNOTE: This protocol is intended for cell isolation from solid tissues.\nChop the tissue using sharp dissection scissors until tissue fragments are approximately 5 mm in any dimension. Transfer the chopped tissue to a C-tube and add 1 mL of media.\nLoad the C-tube onto the device. Fit the tube holder plate (Supplementary Figure 1A) over the D-shaped tube bottoms.\nSecure the tubes to the motor plate by latching the tension arms into the acrylic plate (Supplementary Figure 3).\nSet a custom program: Forward, 30 s; Reverse, 10 s; Loop, 4 times.\n\t\nChoose Custom Mode from the Main Menu by pressing the blue button.\nIn the first custom mode menu, specify the duration of forward rotation to 30 s by pressing the red button until the value on the screen reads 30 s. Press the blue button to select this value and advance to the next menu screen.\nIn the second custom mode menu, specify the duration of reverse rotation to 10 s by pressing the red button until the value on the screen reads 10 s. Press the blue button to select this value and advance to the next menu screen.\nIn the third custom mode menu, specify the number of times to repeat the selections set in steps 2.5.2-2.5.3 by pressing the red button until the value on the screen reads 4X. Press the blue button to select this value and start the program.\n\t\tNOTE: Custom programs are not stored in the device memory but can be programmed as one of the preset programs for faster operation (device programming instructions are provided in Supplementary File 1).",
    "Run the custom program at 200 rpm by adjusting the voltage control dial (Supplementary Figure 3) until the calculated rpm value in the bottom right corner of the LCD Screen reads 200 (Supplementary Figure 4).\nAdd digestion enzymes in 4 mL media according to the tissue and cell types being isolated.\n\tNOTE: For the presented experiments, use Collagenase 4 (1 mg/mL), Collagenase D (1 mg/mL), and DNase (40 µg/mL).\nLoad the C-tube onto the device and repeat steps 2.3-2.6 to run the following program at 200 rpm: Forward, 30 s; Reverse, 10 s; Loop, 4 times.\nTransfer the device with the tubes still loaded to a 37 °C incubator for 45 min.\nLoad the C-tube onto the device and repeat steps 2.3-2.6 to run the following program at 50 rpm: Forward, 270 s; Reverse, 30 s; Loop, 9 times.\nAdd EDTA to achieve a 5 mM concentration in the sample.\nLoad the C-tube onto the device and repeat steps 2.3-2.6 to run the following program at 100 rpm: Forward, 30 s; Reverse, 10 s; Loop, 2 times.\nPush the sample through a 70 µm cell strainer and collect it in a 50 mL or 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the collected cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant using a pipette and resuspend cells in 1 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer. Incubate for 1 min at room temperature.\nNeutralize the lysis buffer with 9 mL of cold Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS).\nCentrifuge the collected cells again at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant using a pipette and resuspend cells in the desired buffer or media.\n3. Data analysis\nAnalyze the data using a graphing and statistical analysis software (see Table of Materials).",
    "Use unpaired Welch t-tests to compare pairs of samples or groups, with sample sizes n > 4 mice representing 2 replicate experiments.\n\tNOTE: Differences were considered statistically significant when (p < 0.05). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.\nSubscription Required.
