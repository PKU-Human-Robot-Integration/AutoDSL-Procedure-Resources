    "1. Expression media and culture condition\nTransform the pET-22b vector containing the BaCDA gene into E. coli Rosetta pLysS competent cells using the heat-shock method, as described in15.\n\tNOTE: Care has to be taken while working with microorganisms. All microbiological work has to be performed inside a biosafety cabinet hood to avoid contamination.\nPerform the preliminary expression study in TB media containing 0.05% (w/v) glucose and 0.2% (w/v) lactose at 16 °C and 180 rpm. Grow 6.792 x 107 E. coli Rosetta pLysS cells in 100 mL of media containing BaCDA cloned plasmid till it reaches the stationary phase. At the mentioned growth conditions, the E. coli Rosetta pLysS cells reach an optical density 600 (OD600) of 10.85 ± 0.21.\n\tNOTE: Composition of the TB media (% w/v): tryptone, 1.2; yeast extract, 2.4; glycerol, 0.6; and 1x TB salt (17 mM KH2PO4 and 74 mM K2HPO4)17.\n2. Optimization and experimental design\nDesign the experiments and fit the second-order polynomial model in central composite design using the statistical tool software. The statistical software used in the present study was MINITAB 17.0 (trial version).\n\t\nTo do this, open the software and click on the following buttons: Stat > DoE > Response surface > Create response surface > Response design > Central composite. The output appears as a dialogue box.\nFeed the five parameters, incubation temperature, agitation rate, incubation time, glucose concentration, and lactose concentration, at five levels (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2) in the dialogue box.",
    "To do this, enter the parameters with the levels in the dialogue box, enter the details of all the parameters, and press OK. This generates the experimental design matrix with six replicates at the center point, requiring 32 experimental runs. The software generates a table containing the parameters and their levels in coded and uncoded terms, used in the process optimization using CCD (Table 1).\nPerform the 32 experiments with the software-generated conditions. Feed the experimental results into the experimental design matrix (generated by the software) containing levels and parameters in terms of coded and uncoded units (Table 2).\nAnalyze the experimental design matrix (Table 2) using the software. To do this, open the software and feed the response into the datasheet. Select Response column > Stat > DoE > Response surface > Analyze response surface design > OK. The output is analyzed for statistical significance, and a model is predicted by the software.\nTable 1: The parameters and their levels in coded and uncoded terms used in the experimental design to estimate the expression of recombinant chitin deacetylase in E. coli Rosetta pLysS cells.

Please click here to download this Table.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64590/Table 2_Re.xlsx]\n3. Validation of model\nValidate the designed model using the response optimizer tool available in the software.\nRepeat the fermentation at software-predicted optimum conditions and compare the experimental value with the software-predicted value.",
    "To do this, open the software and select Response column > Stat > DoE > Response surface > Response optimizer > Maximize > OK. The output is optimum process conditions and values predicted by the software. Repeat the fermentation at predicted optimum conditions and compare the values.\n4. Analytical methods\nExpression, biomass, and protein quantification\n\t\nPerform the fermentation in 32 conditions given by the software in the experimental design matrix (Table 2). Obtain the pellet after each run by centrifuging the culture at 5,405 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Weigh the cell pellet to determine the biomass yield.\n\t\tNOTE: All microbial handling should be done in aseptic conditions (i.e., inside biosafety cabinets).\nLyse the cell pellet to obtain periplasmic protein by sonication. Add 5 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole) to each gram of cell pellet and disrupt by sonicating for 10 cycles with a pulse of 10 s on and 10 s off at 60% amplitude. Collect the lysate by centrifuging at 5,405 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Quantify the protein concentration by Bradford's assay26.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid protein denaturation, sonication has to be done under cold conditions. Place the samples on ice while performing sonication.\nAnalyze the BaCDA expression using SDS-PAGE followed by ImageJ software. Load 10 µL of soluble cell lysate (periplasmic protein) on 12% bis-acrylamide gel and run under 1x tris-glycine-SDS (TGS) buffer at a 100 V current for 2 h. After the run is completed, stain the gel with Coomassie blue and destain to remove the background27.",
    "Capture an image using a gel documentation unit. Determine the BaCDA expression by comparing the band intensity in the form of the pixel values using ImageJ software. Consider the experimental run with the lowest BaCDA activity and biomass as the reference pixel 28.\n\t\t\nTo do this, open the software and open the image file, then select each lane using the rectangular box. Go to Analyze and set each lane as 100%, then select the overexpressed band in each lane using the rectangular box. Go to Analyze and determine the intensity of the band, repeat the process in each lane, and export the result as .xls file. Consider the band intensity of the experimental run with the lowest BaCDA activity as the reference intensity and analyze the expression of each lane.\nEnzyme activity assay\n\t\nDetermine the BaCDA activity using an acetate assay kit15, using ethylene glycol chitin (1 mg/mL; EGC) as the substrate29.\nAllow 20 µL of BaCDA to react with 40 µL of the substrate in the presence of 40 µL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7) buffer for 1 h at 30 °C by agitating at 800 rpm.\nAfter 1 h, centrifuge the 100 µL reactant through a 3 kDa column at 2,111 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. Discard the retentate comprising of BaCDA and collect the filtrate containing acetate released during the reaction. Use the filtrate for the acetate assay to determine the BaCDA activity.\n\t\t​NOTE: One unit of the enzyme is defined as the activity which releases 1 µM of acetate from the substrate per microliter of enzyme per minute. The enzyme activity assay was carried out in triplicates, and the respective enzyme activity was calculated accordingly.\nFermentation kinetics of lactose induction",
    "Investigate the activity profile to determine the point of lactose induction and expression start point. The activity profiling is made by estimating biomass and BaCDA activity with the optimized fermentation conditions.\nDetermine the glucose concentration in the media using a glucose estimation kit. Plot the activity profile using biomass, glucose concentration, and BaCDA activity against the fermentation time.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
