    "Reduction, denaturation, alkylation, and trypsin digestion of IP eluateMost standard IP protocols are adaptable to this procedure. It is recommended to immunoprecipitate bait protein from 2-10 mg protein extract for this procedure (the amount of protein present in the sample following immunoprecipitation will be in the low-microgram range). Following lysis, immunoprecipitation, and washes, add 3× resin volume of IP elution buffer (see Recipes section for info on bolded solutions) to the sample. Incubate at 65°C for 15 min.Note: Resin volume refers to the quantity of beads used in the IP. For example, if 30 μl of a 50:50 agarose resin:buffer slurry is used, the resin volume is 15 μl, and the volume of elution buffer used would be 45 μl. Spin down the sample at 1,000 × g for 1 min. Take the supernatant (= volume of IP elution buffer used in the previous step) and transfer to a new tube.Note: If the sample has been metabolically labeled for SILAC analysis, light and heavy IP eluates should be pooled prior to iodoacetamide treatment. Add iodoacetamide (IAc) solution to a final concentration of 25 mM. Incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15 min.Add 4 volumes PPT solution (see Recipes) to the sample. Vortex the tube for 10 s to wash the entire interior, and incubate on ice for 30 min-1 h. Longer incubation times may marginally improve the yield, but 30 min should be sufficient to precipitate most proteins. PPT contains flammable acetone and should be handled with care.Spin the sample at max speed (~14,000 × g) in a benchtop centrifuge for 10 min.Pour off PPT solution. You should see a small white pellet at the bottom of the tube. Alternatively, there may be small granules of protein spattered along the side of the tube.",
    "Add 1 ml PPT solution to the tube and vortex to wash the top and sides. Spin down at max speed for 1 min. Pour off PPT.Gently tap the open tube against a kimwipe to remove residual PPT, taking care not to dislodge the pellet at the bottom. Leave the tube open at room temperature for ~5 min, or until the acetone smell is nearly gone.Add 20 µl urea/tris solution to the tube. Vortex the sample 30 s, then add 60 µl ddH2O. Vortex again.Add 1 µl Trypsin Gold solution to the tube. Parafilm the top of the tube and nutate at 37°C overnight.Desalting the sampleThe next day, acidify the sample by adding formic acid (FA) at a final concentration of 0.25% and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at a final concentration of 0.25%. Additionally, add 2 µl α/β casein peptide digest (see Recipes section for details on how to prepare this solution).Note: It is recommended to make 10% working stocks of TFA and FA in water for use. Prepare a micro-spin desalting column by adding 20 µl 100 mg/ml C18 resin in acetonitrile.First, remove the luer plug from the micro-spin column.Obtain C18 resin by cutting open a Waters C18 Sep-Pak column of any size. Weigh out a small amount of C18 powder and resuspend in pure acetonitrile at a concentration of 100 mg/ml.Spin at 1,500 × g for 30 s. If C18 resin is not yet level at the bottom of the micro-spin column, add 40 µl acetonitrile to the column and spin again.Condition the column by adding 100 µl C18 Buffer E and spin at 1,500 × g for 30 s.Equilibrate the column by adding 100 µl C18 Buffer W1 and spin at 1,500 × g for 30 s.Load the acidified sample onto the column; approx. 100 µl.",
    "Spin at 1,500 × g for 30 s.Wash the column by adding 100 µl C18 Buffer W1 and spin at 1,500 × g for 30 s.Wash the column by adding 100 µl C18 Buffer W2 and spin at 1,500 × g for 30 s.Wash the column by adding 100 µl C18 Buffer W3 and spin at 1,500 × g for 30 s.Elute the sample into a low protein binding Eppendorf tube by adding 100 µl C18 Buffer E and spin at 1,500 × g for 30 s.Place the sample in a speedvac until dry; approx. 40 min.Note: It is important to ensure that the sample is completely dry. If some liquid persists after 40 min of drying, continue drying in the speedvac until all the liquid is gone. Reconstitute the sample in 20 µl 0.1% acetic acid in ddH2O.Preparation of Fe-NTA resinAdd 25 ml IMAC stripping solution to a 50-ml tube.Remove a Qiagen Ni-NTA spin column from its package (Figure 1a) and associated collection tube. Make sure that the cap is open and hold the column over the open 50-ml tube containing 25 ml IMAC stripping solution (Figures 1b and 1c). With the tip of tweezers or similar thin, pointy object, poke the bottom aperture of the column to dislodge the two frits and the resin in between (Figure 1c). The frits and resin will fall into the 50-ml tube (Figure 1d). Nutate for 1 h to strip the nickel from the NTA resin.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4113/bioprotoc-11-15-4113-g002.jpgFigure 1. Harvesting Ni-NTA resin from spin column.

(d) Frits from Ni-NTA column afloat in stripping solution. Resin will sink to the bottom.",
    "After a 50-min nutation in stripping solution, frits can be discarded.Spin at 1,000 × g for 1 min. Discard the supernatant. This first supernatant will include the two frits from the Ni-NTA column.Wash once with 25 ml ddH2O.Wash once with 25 ml 0.6% acetic acid in ddH2O.Resuspend the resin in 18 ml 0.3% acetic acid in ddH2O. Add 2 ml FeCl3 solution. Nutate for 2-3 h to bind the iron to the NTA resin.Spin at 1,000 × g for 1 min. Discard the supernatant.Wash once with 25 ml 0.6% acetic acid in ddH2O.Wash once with 25 ml IMAC wash I.Note: For this step, nutate for 1 min before spinning down. Wash once with 25 ml 0.1% acetic acid in ddH2O.Resuspend the resin in 0.1 ml 0.1% acetic acid in ddH2O and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube. The Fe-NTA resin should be prepared fresh every time.Preparation of gel-loader tip column.Clean a small area of bench surface with ethanol. Have glass fiber (4), gel-loader tips (3), BD syringes with slip tip (2), and a small section of 125-µm capillary tubing ready (1) (see Figure 2a).Fit the gel loader tip onto a micropipette. Take up 10 µl ddH2O and make a mark at the 10 µl level with a permanent marker.Remove the gel-loader tip from the pipette and cut the top of it with scissors so that it will fit snugly onto a 1-ml BD syringe.Roll a tiny wisp of glass fiber between gloved fingers. Cut into a small 5-10 mm segment using a razor blade.Insert the glass fiber segment into the top end of the gel-loader tip with the 10-µl mark (Figure 2b). Use the section of 125-μm capillary tubing to force the glass fiber segment into the tip of the gel-loader tip.",
    "Crimp the end of the gel loader tip with tweezers. Some glass fiber should be protruding from the end of the gel-loader tip at this point (Figure 2b, note wisp at end of tip). Use a razor blade to cut off any protruding glass fiber (Figure 2c).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4113/bioprotoc-11-15-4113-g003.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of gel-loader tip micro-column. (a) Materials needed for column assembly: (1) 125-μm capillary tubing; (2) 1-ml BD syringe with slip tip; (3) gel-loader tip; and (4) glass fiber, rolled and cut into small sections. (b) Gel-loader tip (note 10-μl mark in blue ink) with top cut to adapt to BD syringe and glass fiber wisp protruding slightly from tip. (c) Final resin-filled gel-loader tip ready for phosphopeptide enrichment. Inset shows where end has been crimped and wisp removed to form a flat tip.Phosphopeptide enrichment.Prepare the column (see Figures 2 and 3 for column assembly) by adding 20 µl 0.1% acetic acid:resin mixture from Step C11 to the gel-loader tip. Use the BD syringe to apply backpressure to the column, forcing the resin to settle. Keep the column vertical at all times to ensure that the resin bed is even and undisturbed. Keep adding 0.1% acetic acid:resin mixture until the resin level reaches the 10-µl mark on the gel-loader tip. Once the settled resin has reached the 10-µl mark, use the BD syringe to force the remaining 0.1% acetic acid solution through the column.Note: It is critically important to not allow the column to dry out. This is challenging due to the small volumes being worked with. When initially preparing the column and when performing washes, allow the liquid to reach the very edge of the resin bed (meniscus should nearly disappear). At this point, the column must be quickly removed from the BD syringe to prevent drying.",
    "In between washes, place the resin-filled gel-loader tip upright in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4113/bioprotoc-11-15-4113-g004.jpgFigure 3. BD syringe with phosphopeptide enrichment column. Figure shows a completed, assembled phospho-peptide enrichment column.Once the phosphopeptide enrichment column has been assembled, wash once with 25 µl IMAC wash II to equilibrate the column.Note: When passing solutions over the column, great care must be taken not to disturb the resin bed. Pipette carefully! Apply the acidified, trypsinized sample to the column (20 µl reconstituted in 0.1% acetic acid, from protocol Step B12). Apply consistent pressure using the BD syringe and discard the flowthrough.Note: Optionally, the flowthrough can be saved for a second attempt at phospho-enrichment if the first attempt fails. Once the sample has been fully loaded onto the resin, pipette 100 µl IMAC wash I onto the column, then remove 90 µl, leaving 10 µl. Push 10 µl through the column using the BD syringe.Pipette 100 µl ddH2O onto the column, then remove 90 µl, leaving 10 µl. Push 10 µl through the column using the BD syringe. While the ddH2O elutes, use a kimwipe to wipe the very tip of the gel-loader column. This will help to remove any residual contaminants.Elute the phosphopeptides with 30 µl IMAC elution solution into a target polypropylene conical insert tube inside a microcentrifuge tube labeled “90%”. Then transfer 3 µl into another target polypropylene conical insert tube inside a microcentrifuge tube labeled “10%.”Place both the samples in a speedvac until fully dry.Resuspend both samples in 5 µl 0.1 P solution.Proceed to MS analysis. Due to the low abundance and hydrophobicity of phosphopeptides, it is recommended to avoid using a trapping column. First run 5% of the total sample.",
    "If the MS chromatogram is relatively free of polymers and other contaminants, load increasing amounts of sample (for example: 10%, 20%, and 50%). Proceed to the “Data analysis” section.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210730/20210730195019_2596.jpgFigure 4. Representative IP-IMAC chromatogram. Representative chromatogram from 5% sample in 0.1P solution (top panel). Proceed to an injection of 20% sample (bottom panel) if chromatography from the 5% sample shows symmetric peaks with few contaminants. Contaminants are identifiable as any +1 charge state ions present in the sample. The same quantity of angiotensin II peptide is present in both samples (~200 fmoles). Casein peptides are also indicated. Casein peptide (1): β casein, m/z 1031.41, FQSphosEEQQQTEDELQDK; casein peptide (2): α casein, m/z 830.90, VPQLEIVPNSphosAEER."
