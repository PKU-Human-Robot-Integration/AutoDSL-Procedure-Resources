    "All institutional approvals were obtained before patient imaging.\n1. Image Acquisition and Segmentation\nAcquire a thoracic MRI scan of a neonate in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. Capture every slice of the scan in the ventricular diastolic stage of the heart cycle or obtain a thoracic MRI from an autopsy.\n\tNOTE: A visibly clear definition of the heart muscle, as well as atria and ventricles, is essential.\nUsing processing software (see Table of Materials) import the DICOM file of the thoracic MRI. Using the 'Editing Masks' menu item, select the area of the heart muscle on each MRI slice where the heart is present. The atria and ventricles, in this case, can be covered as well.\nCreate a new sketch layer and separately segment the two atria and two ventricles in the same manner as the selection for the heart muscle. Do not segment the valves present between the atria and ventricles, and between the ventricles and arteries.\nRender the muscle and chambers into separate 3D representations using the 'Calculate 3D' menu item and export them as five STereoLithography (.stl) files using the optimal resolution settings by using the 'STL+' menu item.\nLoad the.stl files into the CAD software (see Table of Materials). Use the fix wizard menu item to repair the.stl files for overlapping triangles and bad edges. Save the.stl files again.\n\tNOTE: If no heart MRI is available, consider using the heart model used in this protocol. This file also contains separate heart valve models.

Processing and Mold Printing\nLoad the set of atria and ventricles into a computer-aided design software (see Table of Materials).Â Please click here to download the files[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56710/Cardiac_model_parts.zip].",
    "Determine the position of the aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid valves using the original MRI (Figure 1).\nAdd the positive and negative mold halves of each valve to their respective position in the loaded set of atria and ventricles by dragging the valve file (obtained through the link above) into the current file activating the 'insert part' function. Indicate the position of placement by clicking the location of the surface of the atria or ventricles.\n\t\nExtrude the base of the positive and negative valve using 'features tab > extrude boss/base' to protrude into their respective chambers and merge the valve parts to their respective chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: The mitral valve consists of two semilunar parts, while the tricuspid, aortic, and pulmonary valves consist of three.\nAdd the pulmonary and aortic valve file to their respective ventricle location using the procedure described in step 2.2. From the top of these valves, sketch two arching cylinders of 5 mm diameter by clicking the 'sketch tab > circle' following a sketched arched line using the 'features tab > sweep boss/base' until both circular cylinder surfaces reach the horizontal position. Merge the valve parts to their respective ventricles and arteries.\nFrom the base of each of the four chambers, as well as the two arched cylinders, draw vertical cylinders of 5 mm diameter by clicking the 'sketch tab > circle' item and extrude them to 40 mm in length by clicking the 'features tab > extrude boss/base' item. Let each cylinder protrude into their respective chamber.",
    "To ensure the chambers positioning when assembling the six inner parts in the mold, add differential notches to the six cylinders (Figure 2) by sketching semicircles on top of the cylinders: click the 'sketch tab > sketch circle' menu item and use the 'feature tab > cut/extrude' menu item to create different depth indentations.\n\t\t\nSubtract their shapes from the chambers and arteries by selecting the solid body of the chamber and artery, right clicking, and pressing the 'combine' function after which the subtract setting can be selected. Do not merge these parts. Save all chambers and arteries separately.\nImport the heart muscle model. Offset the six-cylinder base sketches by starting a new sketch and selecting all cylinder base sketches by holding down the 'shift' key. Then, select the 'sketch tab > convert entities' menu item. Select the 'sketch tab > offset entities' menu item to offset the sketches by 2 mm.\n\t\nExtrude and merge these sketches by clicking the 'features tab > extrude boss/bass' menu item with the heart muscle model; repeat for the arching cylinders. Merge these cylinders with the heart muscle model by clicking the 'features tab > extrude boss/bass' menu item.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the heart muscle model opposite of the atria is over 2 mm in distance (Figure 1). Otherwise the wall will rupture when removing the inner molds.\nModel a cube from the base of the six cylinders down by first placing a reference plane by clicking the 'features tab > reference geometry > plane'. After this, click the 'sketch tab > square' menu item and sketch a square with a length and width that is 4 mm wider than the widest part of the heart muscle model.",
    "Extrude this downwards with a thickness of 8 mm by clicking the 'features tab > extrude boss/base' menu item, and merge this to the base of the six cylinders marking the 'merge parts' menu item. On the four corners of the base, add 4 mm cubes using the same method.\nUsing the square base as a sketch, extrude it to cover the entire heart model and subtract all other parts from this. Split the top part of the leftover rectangle at the widest part of the heart model. First place a reference plane at the desired height using the 'features tab > reference geometry > plane. After this, use the menu item 'insert > molds > split' to select the surface over which the split has to take place and the object requiring splitting.\n\t\nSplit the leftover rectangle again at the most convenient mold release position using the same method described in step 2.7 yet in a vertical position. Sketch 4 mm cubic sockets in the corners of the longitudinal parts of the mold and add 4 mm cubes to the corners of the top cover using the 'sketch tab > square' and 'features tab > extrude boss/base' menu items.\nSketch 50 circles of 1 mm in diameter covering the top of the entire outer mold model and cut-extrude these through all outer molds. Also, extrude several 1 mm cylinders on the side of the top cover at the widest locations of the heart muscle model. Cut-extrude a single 8 mm injection hole from the top cover.\n\t\nSave all four outer mold parts separately.",
    "CAUTION: In total, there should be ten mold components: the base of the mold, two outer mold side panels, one outer mold top cover, two inner mold atria with valve attachments, two inner mold ventricles with valve attachments, and one of each aortic and pulmonary inner mold artery with valve attachments.\nUse a jetting printer for printing with rigid and rubber-like photopolymer materials installed\n\t(see Table of Materials). When placing the parts for printing on the print bed, ensure the valve negatives are all printed facing upwards (vertically) (Figure 3).\n\t\nSelect the print settings to glossy. For the four chambers as well as the pulmonary and aortic mold attachments, select the flexible S95 material; for the other four mold parts, select the rigid print material.\nAfter printing the mold parts, remove the support material built up during printing by waterjet (see Table of Materials). After cleaning the mold parts, place the parts in a 5% sodium hydroxide solution for 24 h. After removing the parts from the solution, rinse them using cold water and leave to dry for 48 h before casting.\n3. Cold Injection Molding and Finishing\nSpray all surfaces of all mold parts with a release agent (see Table of Materials), except the valves, and wipe clean with tissue paper. Leave to dry for 15 min.\n\t\nClose the base of the mold and two side panels, and place on top of two spacers, so the base of the mold is not in direct contact with the table surface. Prepare the silicone by inserting a silicone cartridge into the manual dispensing gun (see Table of Materials).",
    "Add 5 mL of silicone squeezed from the dispensing gun into a measuring cup and mix using a toothpick. Using a toothpick, apply a generous amount of melted silicone to the negative and positive side of the right atria and ventricle valves. Make sure there are no air bubbles entrapped in the silicone (Figure 4).\n\t\nConnect the two chambers at the right valve angle, and push them onto their respective cylinders of the base mold. Repeat this for the left side. Finally, attach the pulmonary and aortic arched cylinders similarly. Leave these valves to solidify for 2 min, then attach the top part of the mold.\nAttach a static mixer to the cartridge, squeeze until the silicone is exiting the nozzle, then release the pressure. Position the entire mold on two spacers (Figure 5), insert the gun into the 8-mm injection molding socket, and squeeze with low pressure over the course of 3 min until all the air vents show signs of silicone overflow.\n\t\nStop injecting the silicone at this point, remove the mixer, and place the mold onto the table surface so that all bottom air vents are sealed, and no more silicone can flow from the bottom of the mold. Leave the silicone to solidify for 30 min.\nOpen the top part of the mold by prying and lifting a metal spacer into the crack between the top and lower part of the mold. Remove the side parts of the mold using the same method, removing one side at a time.\n\tNOTE: Make sure not to puncture the heart wall when inserting the spacer.",
    "Detect any air bubbles at the heart exterior after releasing the three outer mold components (Figure 6). Use a scalpel to pierce the bubble and fill it with a small amount silicone using a toothpick, then leave to cure for another 30 min.\nUse compressed air (see Table of Materials) to blow the heart model off the base of the mold leaving the six inner molds in the heart model. Make sure to firmly enclose the heart model with one hand to prevent air rupturing the heart wall.\n\t\nUse a syringe with water to fill and pressurize the left and right ventricles to release the inner molds. After this use a Magill forceps (see Table of Materials) to grab and pull out these inner two mold parts. Repeat this process for the pulmonary and aortic arteries and lastly for removing the left and right atria inner molds.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the positioning of the forceps does not compress the valve segment when clamp pressure is applied; it will destroy the printed valve.\nBind the two tubes leading directly downwards from the ventricles at the base of the heart model using tie wraps and remove access air vent strings by plucking them at the heart wall surface.\nSubscription Required.
