    "During the study, animal care and treatment complied with National Institutes of Health policy, were in accordance with institutional guidelines, and were approved by the University of Hartford Animal Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Entrainment of Animals\nNOTE: Twenty week-old male B6129SF2/J mice are used in the study.\nEntrain mice to a 12 h light (standard overhead white light)/12 h dark cycle for 2 weeks prior to the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Here zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 corresponds to lights on and ZT12 to lights off, while keeping all other environmental factors (i.e., food, water, and room temperature) constant 21.\n2. Preparation of Instruments, Culture Medium, and Challenge Medium\nAutoclave forceps and dissecting scissors. Wrap pairs of frosted microscope slides in aluminum foil and autoclave.\nPrepare culture medium by adding fetal bovine serum (FBS) to RPMI 1640 to a final concentration of 10%. Prepare 10 mL of challenge medium in 50 mL tubes by adding the following PAMPs to the culture medium (RPMI with 10% FBS); LPS (5 µg/mL), ODN1826 (5 µg/mL), heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (108 HKLM/mL), or another PAMP in its suggested concentration.\nWarm culture medium and challenge medium to 37 °C in a water bath, and keep approximately 70 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) at room temperature.\nAdd 10 mL of culture medium using a 10 mL pipette and pipette aid to a 50 mL tube and place on ice.\nAdd approximately 30 mL of 70% ethanol to a 100 mL beaker and place ends of dissecting scissors and forceps into the beaker to prevent microbial contamination.",
    "Prepare lysis buffer for RNA isolation by adding 10 µL β-Mercaptoethanol (under a fume hood) to every 1 mL of Buffer RLT in a 50 mL tube. Make only the amount that will be needed (600 µL per sample, which consists of approximately 1 x 106 cells).\n\tNOTE: The Buffer RLT is a component of the RNA extraction kit that supports the binding of RNA to the silica membrane.\n3. Splenocyte Isolation and Challenge\nEuthanize mice at a particular zeitgeber time via narcosis by keeping them in their original cage and adding CO2 to the cage at a flow rate of 3 L/min. Continue supplying CO2 for 1 min after breathing stops.\nConfirm death via cervical dislocation by placing the thumb and index finger on either side of the neck at the base of the skull. Alternatively, press a rod at the base of the skull while quickly pulling (using the other hand) the base of the tail or the hind limbs to cause separation of the cervical vertebrae from the skull22.\nSpray the mouse trunk with 70% ethanol and wipe with a paper towel. Place the mouse on its back and slightly tilted onto its right side. Cut away the fur, using dissecting scissors, along the mouse's left side, about halfway between the front and back legs.\nUsing forceps, grab the peritoneum and carefully make an incision so as not to damage the spleen. Remove spleen with forceps and place into a sterile 50 mL tube containing approximately 10 mL of culture media on ice. Repeat for the remaining animals.\n\t​NOTE: The spleen is the color of a kidney bean, and it is longer and flatter than the kidney.\nTransfer one spleen with 2 mL of culture medium to a small sterile Petri dish.",
    "Homogenize the spleen by grinding it between the frosted portion of two sterile frosted slides. If possible, keep the issue and cells in the medium during the homogenization process.\nOnce thoroughly homogenized, pipet the 2 mL of culture medium containing the splenocytes through a 40 µm nylon cell strainer into a 50 mL tube.\nRepeat the above steps for the remaining spleens using new pairs of frosted slides, 50 mL tubes with culture medium, and cell strainers.\nAdd 8 mL of cold culture medium to each of the 50 mL tubes containing the splenocytes for a total volume of 10 mL/tube. Determine the number of cells per milliliter using a hemocytometer.\nAdd approximately 1 x 106 cells/well to 6-well culture plates. Add cells to the number of wells that correspond to the number of different PAMPs being used for the experiment and include a control well. Add 3 mL of culture medium or 3 mL of challenge medium to the respective wells.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h.\nScrape the cells from the bottom of the well using a 1,000 µL pipet tip attached to a P1000 micropipette. Transfer the medium containing the cells using the same 1,000 µL pipet tip to a 15 mL tube.\nPellet the cells via centrifugation at 167 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove the supernatant and wash the cell pellet with 5 mL of PBS.\nPellet the cells a second time at 167 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant, and add 600 µL of lysis buffer to the cell pellet in order to lyse the cells. Then proceed to RNA isolation.\n4. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis",
    "Isolate RNA from splenocytes using the RNA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions and perform the 'optional' on-column DNA digestion.\nPrior to cDNA synthesis, determine RNA concentration using a microvolume spectrophotometer to verify that the concentration is within the optimal RNA range (up to 2 µg) of the cDNA synthesis kit.\nSynthesize cDNA for each of the samples using the reverse transcription kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Use 10 µL of RNA for each of the samples in a 20 µL total reaction volume. At the completion of the reverse transcription (thermocycler run) add 20 μL H2O to each reaction.\nConstruct the standard curving using a P10 or P20 micropipette to pool mRNA from a few control samples (e.g., 5 µL from 2 samples for a total of 10 µL) into a 0.5 mL tube to prepare the cDNA.\n\t\nAdd 10 µL 2x reverse transcriptase master mix.\nAt the completion of the reverse transcription, add 10 µL of H2O to the reaction tube, which will serve as the starting concentration (\"1\") in the dilution series for the standard curve.\nPerform a 10-fold dilution series (1 to 10-4) by adding 45 µL of water using a P100 or P200 micropipette into four 0.5 mL tubes designated 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, and 10-4.\n\t\t\nAdd 5 µL of the starting concentration \"1\" into the first tube (10-1) using a P20 micropipettor, mix by pipetting up and down several times, then transfer 5 µL from the 10-1 tube into the tube designated 10-2 and mix.\nTransfer 5 µL using a P20 micropipette from the 10-2 tube into the tube designated 10-3 and mix. Transfer 5 µL using a P20 micropipettor from the 10-3 tube into the tube designated 10-4 and mix.\n5. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR)",
    "Determine relative quantitation of mRNA levels by qPCR. Within the experimental set up, select \"Quantitation - Relative Standard Curve\" and \"TaqMan\" chemistry. Change the reaction volume to 10 µL. Enter the relevant information into the plate layout (e.g., target gene, standard curve, reporter, etc.).\nPrepare the reaction so that it contains 0.5 µL of the primer/probe assay, 5 µL of gene expression master mix, 2 µL of H2O and 2.5 µL of cDNA (10–100 ng).\n\t\nPrepare a master mix by multiplying each of the preceding reagents (except the cDNA) by the number of reactions, making sure to include those from the standard curve, negative controls, performing each reaction in duplicate, and 2 extra reactions that will account for pipetting variation.\nPipet 7.5 µL of the prepared master mix into pre-determined wells in a 96-well reaction plate with a micropipette or a multichannel pipette. Pipet 2.5 µL of cDNA into the appropriate well for the unknowns and standards, and 2.5 µL of H2O into the negative control wells.\nInclude primer/probe assays for various molecular clock genes, and also include an assay for an endogenous control (e.g., β-actin).\nIn order to determine relative expression values, calculate the mean relative quantity for each replicate, then, for each sample, divide the mean relative quantity for the target gene by the mean relative quantity for β-actin.\n6. Statistical Analysis\nUsing statistical analysis software, enter data into the program under the column statistics option. Select a one-way ANOVA with the Dunnett's post hoc test to assess differences between mean values of clock gene expression after PAMP challenge versus the control.\nSubscription Required.
