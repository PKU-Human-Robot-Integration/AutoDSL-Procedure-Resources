    "NOTE: All protocols involving animals were followed in accordance with the animal care guidelines of The Pennsylvania State University, IACUC #44057\n1. Lentivirus Production\nNOTE: The day before transfection, LentiX-293 cells should be at 80% confluency.\nRinse cells with DMEM just before transfection and incubate in 10 ml of DMEM/10% FBS with Penicillin (100 IU/ml) and Streptomycin (100 µg/ml) for 5 min at RT.\nDilute DNA and Polyethylenimine (PEI) (1 mg/ml) in 1:3 ratio (1 µg of DNA: 3 µl of PEI) in 1 ml of DMEM and vortex for 1 min. The volume of DNA added is dependent on the concentration of the DNA. Incubate at RT for 10 min.\n\t\nFor example, use 20 µg of DNA plasmid, comprised of 10 µg of vector plasmid, 5 µg of psPax214 plasmid, 5 µg of vesicular stomatitis virus(VSV) with 60 µl of PEI per dish.\nMix the DNA and PEI solution again by vortexing for 1 min. Incubate at RT for 10 min.\nAdd 1/10th volume of total culture medium of DMEM (i.e. 1 ml for 10 ml culture medium in a 100 mm dish). Add 1 ml of DNA-PEI mixture drop by drop into the dish and swirl the dish around until to the culture medium is well-mixed with the DNA.\nIncubate for 6 hr at RT and remove the supernatant. Add 5 ml of culture medium.\n48 hr after transfection, collect viral supernatant and spin at 627 x g for 5 min at 4 °C in a 50 ml tube. Filter 30 ml of viral supernatant through a 0.45 µm syringe filter into an ultracentrifuge tube.\nAdd sterile water to balance the tubes, and cover tubes with small piece of parafilm. Spin tubes at 11,249 x g for 120 min at 4 °C. Remove liquid using a vacuum tip.",
    "Add 100 µl of cold PBS the tube. Gently rock the tube at 4 °C O/N.\nTo re-suspend the virus, pipette the PBS added in step 1.8 over the pellet 10 times, being careful not to touch the pellet with the tip. The pellet will not be re-suspended until this is complete.\nAliquot the virus at 10-20 µl per tube, flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.\n2. Stereotactic Injection\n2.1) Preparation of Instruments\nPlace a pair of scissors, blunt-end forceps, a needle holder, scalpel, cotton swabs, and a cloth in a sealed pack with a sterilization indicator, and autoclave prior to surgery. Additionally, obtain 10% povidone iodine, 70% ethyl alcohol, absorbable sutures, a heating pad, artificial tears, a glass bead sterilizer, drill, a drill bit, 2 disposable syringes, an injection syringe, electric razor, analgesic (ketoprofen), anesthetic (avertin), gloves, and a stereotactic apparatus with injection pump.\nMake 1.25% avertin solution fresh that day, filter in a sterile hood using a 0.2 µm sterile syringe filter, and place into a sterile serum vial. Mix 2.5 g of 2,2,2-tribromoethyl alcohol into 5 ml of tert-amyl alcohol, then dissolve in 200 ml water. Keep the pH below 5.15\n2.2) Preparation of the Mouse\nAdminister avertin based on the weight of the mouse (375 mg/kg).15 Inject the mouse with the avertin via an intraperitoneal (IP) injection, and then place back into its cage until fully anesthetized.\nGive an analgesic via IP injection (ketaprofen, 5 mg/kg), and place artificial tears on the eyes of the mouse to prevent drying.",
    "Ensure that the mouse is fully asleep by pinching their foot. If the mouse responds to the foot pinch, then give more anesthetic (in doses of 50 µl). Shave the head of the mouse using an electric razor. Shave the area to be operated on (typically from just behind the ears, to the top of the snout), and the surrounding area.\nPlace the mouse into the stereotactic apparatus. Latch the front teeth onto the anterior clamp, and lower the clamp and tighten it so that the jaw is fully secure.\nInsert the ear bars into the ear canal to fully stabilize the head. Be careful not to insert the ear bars in too far, which could damage the inner ear. Once finished, the body of the mouse should be able to be moved slightly without disrupting the position of the head.\nPlace a heating pad under the mouse in order to regulate the mouse’s body temperature throughout the procedure.\nClean the surgical area thoroughly. Using a cotton swab, rub 10% povidone iodine in a circular motion, starting from the middle of the surgical site and moving outwards. Then, use a cotton swab to rub 70% ethyl alcohol on the surgical site in the same fashion. Repeat two times.\n2.3) The First Incision\nOnce the mouse is prepped, open the sterile equipment bag. Change gloves before touching the instruments. Take out the sterile cloth and place the instruments on the cloth. If any instrument touches an un-sterile surface, use the glass bead sterilizer for 15 sec to sterilize it.",
    "Take the scalpel in the dominant hand and blunt-end forceps in the non-dominant hand. Use the blunt-end forceps to gently grip the skin of the mouse, and make an incision using the scalpel. Begin the incision about 1.5 cm above the ears (toward the nose) and extend to about 0.5 cm below the ears. Extend the incision vertically down the middle of the mouse’s head to expose bregma (Figure 1).\nOnce bregma is visualized, take a sterile cotton tip to gently remove any blood covering the surface of the skull. Use two cotton tips to push the skin toward the side of the head.\n2.4) Equipment Setup\nAfter any blood is removed from the surface of the skull, and bregma is clearly visualized, prepare the syringe (concentration of 108 TU/ml, volume of 1 µl). In the fume hood, fill the syringe with the virus to be injected. Ensure that no bubbles are inside. Place the syringe in the stereotactic apparatus, making sure that it is fully secured.\nSlowly lower the syringe until it is right above the surface of the skull, so that the tip of the sterile syringe needle is set to the intersection of bregma and the interaural line. Set this point as zero, and determine coordinates from this point.\nDepending on the brain area of interest, vary the stereotactic coordinates. Determine these coordinates by utilizing a brain atlas4. Once the coordinates are determined, move the needle of the syringe to match those coordinates. Target the dentate gyrus using the coordinates: M/L= +/- 1 mm, A/P= -1.82 mm. Lower the needle to right above the skull to visualize where the hole needs to be drilled.",
    "Raise the syringe slightly, take the drill and place the drill bit right above the target drill site at about a 45° angle to the skull. Begin drilling, and keep drilling until the skull gives way. When the skull gives way, a drop in resistance can be detected. Be careful not to drill into the brain, so as to prevent cortical damage.\nTake a sterile cotton tip and wipe away any blood from the hole.\nLower the syringe so that the tip sits right on the surface of the brain (not the skull). Set the D/V coordinate (depth) to 0. Lower the syringe to the desired depth, based on the brain atlas coordinates. To reach the dentate gyrus, set D/V to -1.79 mm.\nStart the injection at a rate of 0.2 µl/min. Watch to ensure that the syringe does not slip lower than the desired depth. If this occurs, gently raise the syringe to the desired depth again.\nAfter the injection is finished, wait about 2 min to ensure that any residual virus has been absorbed. Slowly raise the syringe and use a cotton tip to remove any liquid from the injection site.\nRepeat for the other hemisphere.\n2.5) Suturing\nRemove the sterile suture and needle from its packaging and grip the needle using the needle holders. Face the pointed edge of the needle away from the needle holder. Hold the blunt-end forceps in the non-dominant hand, and use it to grip the skin on the mouse. Start with the dominant hand.\nGently push the suture through the skin and use the blunt-end forceps to grab the skin on the other side of the incision. Pull the suture material through until about 0.75 inch remains.",
    "Let go of the needle, and use the blunt-end forceps to wrap the suture around the needle holder one time, then, grab the 0.75 inch remaining suture with the needle holder, and pull the suture through, so that the needle and needle holder end up on the side of the head opposite to that which they were on originally. This should form a knot.\nRepeat this step three more times, alternating the side of the head the needle holder ends up on each time.\nCut the suture and repeat steps 2.5.1-2.5.3 until the incision is closed.\n2.6) Post-operative Care\nGently remove the ear bars from the mouse, and remove its jaw from the anterior clamp.\nKeep the mouse on the heating pad until it wakes up and moves around on its own. Monitor the mouse daily, and keep and eye out for signs of pain, such as not grooming, eating or drinking. Give additional analgesic when deemed necessary.\n3. Open Field Test\n3.1) Set Up\nObtain an empty square, plastic arena with dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm, with 50 cm high walls (but can be slightly larger). Clean the arena with 70% ethyl alcohol prior to the beginning of the experiment. Make sure the ethyl alcohol has fully dried before placing a mouse into the arena.\nPlace the arena on the floor, and try to ensure the lighting is set to minimize shadows and glare.\nIf using tracking software, position the camera directly overhead of the open field, approximately 1.5 ft above the open field (far enough away to full encompass the whole arena, but close enough to have a clear view of the mouse).",
    "Set up a zone in the center of the box (approximately an area of 30 cm x 30 cm).16 To set a zone, click on the zone 1 tab in the side panel.\n\t\nSelect a shape outline in the upper panel, and outline the perimeter of the center zone. Select add zone, and click on the inside of the center zone. Using the program prompts, name the zone (this will be referred to as ‘center’ for this procedure). If the behavioral test will be scored by hand, make sure the bottom of the field is divided into 10 cm x 10 cm squares, marked using tape.\nSet up the software so that the settings are correct, and the mouse is easily visible on the screen. Accomplish this by adjusting the detection settings on the machine to be compatible with the testing arena (lighting) and mouse color.\n\tNOTE: When the settings are correct, the system should track only the mouse, and not any shadows or urine/fecal matter. The specific software settings depend on the lighting of the arena, and the color of the mouse.\n3.2) Acclimation and Test\nMove experimental mice into the behavioral room 1 hr before the test in order to acclimate them to their surroundings. Leave the mice in their cage for the acclimation.\nTurn on the camera to tape the behavioral task and place the mouse toward the middle front of the arena so that the mouse is facing the wall.\nSet the timer for 5 min, and step away from the arena. If possible, leave the room so as to not accidentally influence the mouse.\nOnce 5 min are up, remove the mouse and place them in their cage.",
    "Use 70% ethyl alcohol to thoroughly clean out the field before proceeding to the next mouse. Make sure the ethyl alcohol has fully dried.\n3.3) Scoring\nConsider the mouse as being in the center of the field when all four paws are inside the middle 30 cm x 30 cm.\nQuantify the amount of time the mouse spends in the center. Alternatively, determine this time using tracking software (such as Noldus ethovison).\n\t\nTo do this, go to the analysis tab, and click on “movement” under analysis profiles. Delete the categories currently set, and then select “in zone” under the location tab. Select the center zone. Next, select “analysis output” (under the results tab) to view results. A table listing the time spent immobile for each trial should appear.\nOtherwise, score the OFT by hand. The open field should have 25 10 cm x 10 cm squares outlined on the bottom of the open field (as outlined in step 3.1.3). Quantify the amount of time the mouse spends in the center, in addition to the number of entries into the center of the arena.16\n\tNOTE: The center 30 cm x 30 cm area is considered the center of the open field. A mouse is regarded as inhabiting the center region if all four paws are inside the 30 x 30 cm area.\n4. Forced Swim Test\nNOTE: Allow a minimum of five days between behavioral tasks.\n4.1) Set Up\nObtain a 2 L clear bucket, and fill with 22 °C water. Place the bucket on a table, and try to ensure the lighting is set to minimize shadows and glare.\nIf using tracking software, position the camera directly overhead of the bucket.\nSet up software so that the mouse is easily visible on the screen.\n4.2) Acclimation and Test",
    "Move experimental mice into the behavioral room 1 hr before the test to acclimate the surroundings. Leave the mice in their cage for the acclimation.\nTurn on the camera to tape the behavioral task. Gently, place the mouse in the middle of the bucket of water. Make sure not to drop the mouse in. Slowly lower the mouse, so its front feet touch the water first. Take care to prevent their head from submerging.\nSet the timer for 6 min, and step away from the behavioral area.\nOnce 6 min are up, remove the mouse from the bucket, and wipe off excess water before placing the mouse back in their cage.\n4.3) Scoring\nIf using tracking software, set percent immobility to 11%, as suggested by Noldus (this should be the default setting), to quantify time floating vs. swimming.\nTo quantify using the tracking system, go to the analysis tab, and click on movement under analysis profiles. Delete the categories currently set, and then select mobility state, on the left side panel (under individual behavior). Set immobility to 11%.\nSelect track visualization, under the results tab. Select analysis output (under the results tab) to view results. A table listing the time spent immobile for each trial should appear.\nIf hand scoring, measure the time the mouse spends swimming or climbing, and amount of time the mouse spends immobile. In addition, measure the latency to the first time immobile. See Figure 2 in Results Section.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
