    "This procedure is only designed to study the stability of plasmids carried by bacterial species able to uptake rhamnose from the medium, and species in which the ParE toxin is functional. This should be considered before trying to adapt this procedure to new species. Although we employed this assay to measure the stability of the virulence plasmid of Salmonella enterica subs. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. SV5015 (Lobato-Marquez et al., 2016), the method is also useful for E. coli plasmids.Design of recombinant plasmid variantsAmplify aph-parE cassette by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using pKD267 plasmid as template and Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase (~1,800 bp) (see Notes 1 and 2, Table 1 and Figure 1). It is recommended to use the following PCR program: 94 °C 5 min, [94 °C 30 sec; 60 °C 30 sec; 72 °C 2 min] x 10, [94 °C 30 sec; 60 °C 30 sec; 72 °C 2 min + 5 sec increment per cycle] x 25 cycles.Digest the PCR-amplified aph-parE cassette by adding 1 µl of DpnI per 50 µl of PCR reaction. DpnI digests methylated DNA, thus eliminating the parental pKD267 plasmid but not the amplified aph-parE DNA module.Purify the DpnI-digested PCR reaction using a 5Prime PCR purification kit. Elute DNA in MilliQ water. Alternatively, standard precipitation procedures such as the phenol/chloroform precipitation method, can be used to purify the aph-parE DNA fragment (see Note 3). Concentrate purified-PCR product to 500-800 ng/µl using DNA SpeedVac.Transform the strain containing the plasmid for which the stability is to be analyzed, with pKD46 (see Note 4 and Figure 3). Grow the resulting variant in LB containing 50 µg/ml of ampicillin at 30 °C.Make electrocompetent cells of the strain carrying pKD46 (Figure 3).",
    "Pick one colony of the new strain carrying pKD46 plasmid and inoculate 5 ml of LB supplemented with 50 µg/ml of ampicillin and 0.4% arabinose (w/v). Grow the culture for 16 h at 30 °C in 10 ml LB in a 100 ml flask with shaking (~150 rpm).Dilute 1:100 of overnight culture in LB containing 50 µg/ml of ampicillin and 0.4% arabinose in 10:1 flask:medium volume ratio flask.Grow the bacterial culture at 30 °C and 150 rpm up to an optical density (measured at 600 nm) of 0.6.Centrifuge the bacterial culture in a 4 °C refrigerated centrifuge for 5 min at 15,557 x g.Discard the supernatant and rinse the bacterial pellet twice with 4 °C chilled sterile distilled water.Discard the supernatant and rinse the bacterial pellet with 4 °C sterile 10% glycerol.Resuspend the bacterial pellet in sterile 10% glycerol (500 µl per 50 ml of bacterial culture).Aliquot bacterial electrocompetent cells in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes (250 µl culture per tube). Keep on ice if competent cells are going to be used immediately. Otherwise, electrocompetent cells should be kept at -80 °C.Electroporate pKD46 competent cells (2.5 kV, 5 ms) with 800-1,000 ng of purified aph-parE DNA fragment (Figure 3) and grow cells for 3 h at 37 °C (this temperature promotes the loss of pKD46).Plate electroporated cells in LB-plates containing 50 µg/ml of kanamycin and 0.2% of glucose (see Note 5).Confirm the proper integration of the aph-parE cassette in your plasmid using PCR.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170427/20170427005029_0708.jpgFigure 3. Scheme summarizing the design of recombinant plasmid variantsPlasmid stability assayNote: See Note 6 before starting the assay.Inoculate the bacterial culture in 10 ml of LB without selective pressure in a 100 ml flask (10:1 flask:medium volume ratio) at 37 °C and 150 rpm.",
    "Always adjust the amount of inoculum of all used strains by measuring the optical density (600 nm). Grow cultures according to the number of desired bacterial generations (see Notes 7 and 8). For instance, this protocol was optimized for Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium grown for 16 h at 37 °C (~10 generations). Collect 1 ml of grown cultures in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Centrifuge for 1 min at ~10,800 x g at room temperature using a benchtop centrifuge (MiniSpin® Eppendorf), or an equivalent speed in a different benchtop centrifuge.Discard supernatants and wash bacterial pellets twice with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 (see Note 9). Resuspend bacterial pellets in 1 ml PBS.Perform 1:10 serial dilutions using 100 µl of PBS-resuspended bacterial cultures in PBS-containing Eppendorf tubes.Plate 100 µl of the appropriate dilutions onto LB-plates and M9-rhamnose plates by using glass beads. Proper dilution must be adjusted according to the studied plasmid (see Notes 10 and 11). Incubate plates for 24 h (LB-agar) or 48-72 h (M9-rhamnose-agar) at 37 °C before counting the number of colony forming units (CFUs) (see Note 12).To discard false positives, CFUs grown in M9-rhamnose-agar should be tested for their kanamycin resistance by streaking them onto antibiotic-containing LB plates."
