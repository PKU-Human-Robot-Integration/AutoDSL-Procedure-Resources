    "1. Establish Gefitinib-resistant Cells\nDetermine the initial gefitinib concentration by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.\nCulture PC-9 cells in growth medium (RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics (penicillin: 100 U/mL and streptomycin: 100 µg/mL)), in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nAdjust the cells to 1.0 × 105 cells/mL using an automated cell counter (see Table of materials) and seed 50 µL of this in each well of a 96-well plate using the growth medium; the final concentration of cells should be 5.0 × 103 cells/well.\nIncubate the plate overnight at 37 °C.\nAdd 50 µL of gefitinib (at 2X final concentration) at different concentrations: 0, 0.002, 0.006, 0.02, 0.06, 0.2, 0.6, 2, 6, and 20 µM to these wells such that the final volume in each well is 100 µL.\nIncubate the plate for 72 h at 37 °C.\nAdd 15 µL of the dye solution (see Table of Materials) to each well (use final 13% concentration of the dye solution), and incubate for 4 h at 37 °C.\nAdd 100 µL of the solubilization/stop solution (see Table of Materials) for solubilizing the formazan produced by the dye solution (see Table of Materials) in each well, and incubate it overnight at 37 °C.\nMeasure the optical density at 570 nm (OD570) using a microplate reader for obtaining the IC50 value by generating a cell-proliferation curve.\nUse a statistical software (see Table of Materials) to graphically display the data, and calculate the IC50 value (Figure 2).\nPrepare 6-12 replicates and repeat the experiments at least three times.\nContinuous stepwise dose-escalation of gefitinib for treatment of PC-9 cells.\nCulture PC-9 cells (1 mL in sub-confluent condition) in p100 dishes with 10 mL of growth medium in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.",
    "Add one-tenth of the IC50 value of gefitinib into the p100 dish.\n\t\t\nWhen the cells in the culture medium become sub-confluent, add 1-2 mL of cells to 10 mL of fresh growth medium using a 1-mL pipet with 10-30% higher concentration of gefitinib in the same culture conditions.\nIncrease the gefitinib concentration progressively by 10-30% with each split until it reaches 1 µM; this might take about 6-12 months.\n\t\tNOTE: When the concentration of gefitinib reaches the IC50 value, the cell proliferation becomes considerably slower, and so, 2-4 mL of cells may be added to 10 mL of the fresh growth medium with higher concentration of gefitinib; reducing the increase in the concentration of gefitinib might solve the problem. Moreover, it would be ideal to store the remaining cells at -80 °C, and reuse them at the previous concentration. As PC-9 cells are in suspension, it is unnecessary to use trypsin for passaging; however, during the process of increasing gefitinib concentration, the cells may attach to the bottom of culture dish. In such a situation, a cell-scraper can be used for detaching the adherent cells.\nCulture the gefitinib-resistant PC-9 cells in the growth medium with 1 µM of gefitinib.\nPerform the MTT assay to confirm the gefitinib-resistance of the cells13; these gefitinib-resistant cells were named PC-9MET1000 (designated as MET1000 cells), because they exhibited increased protein and RNA levels of MET (Figure 3A, Figure 4A, B).\n2. Establish Dual-resistance to Gefitinib and PHA665752\nDetermine the initial concentration of PHA665752 by MTT assay.\nCulture the MET1000 cells in p100 dishes with 10 mL of growth medium and 1 µM gefitinib in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.",
    "Seed the cells into a 96-well plate at 5.0 × 103 cells/well with 50 µL of the growth medium in each well. Adjust the final concentration of the cells to 1.0 × 105 cells/mL using an automated cell counter (see Table of Materials).\nIncubate the plate overnight at 37 °C.\nAdd 50 µL of PHA665752, a MET-TKI (at 2X final concentration), to the cells in different concentrations: 0, 0.002, 0.006, 0.02, 0.06, 0.2, 0.6, 2, 6, and 20 µM including 2 µM gefitinib (at 2X final concentration); the final volume in each well should be 100 µL.\nIncubate the plate for 72 h at 37 °C.\nAdd 15 µL of the dye solution (see Table of Materials) to each well, and incubate for 4 h at 37 °C.\nAdd 100 µL of the solubilization/stop Solution for solubilizing the formazan produced by the dye solution (see Table of Materials) to each well, and again incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nMeasure the optical density at 570 nm (OD570) using a microplate reader for obtaining the IC50 value by generating a cell-proliferation curve.\nUse a statistical software (see Table of Materials) to graphically display the data, and calculate the IC50 value of PHA665752 in the presence of gefitinib (Figure 3B).\nPrepare 6-12 replicates and repeat the experiments at least three times.\nEstablish the dual-resistance in MET1000 cells to gefitinib and PHA665752.\nCulture the MET1000 cells in p100 dishes with 10 mL of growth medium, and 1 µM gefitinib in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nAdd one-tenth of the IC50 value of PHA665752 into the growth medium in the presence of 1 µM of gefitinib with the same culture conditions.\nIncrease the PHA665752 concentration progressively by 10-30% with each split until it reaches 1 µM. This might take about 6-12 months.",
    "NOTE: When the concentration of PHA665752 reaches the IC50 value, the cell proliferation becomes considerably slower, and so, 2-4 ml of cells may be added using a 1-mL pipet to 10 mL of the fresh growth medium with higher concentration of PHA665752; reducing the increase in the concentration of PHA665752 might solve the problem. Moreover, it would be ideal to store the remaining cells at -80 °C, and reuse them at the previous concentration. It is unnecessary to use trypsin for passaging; however, during the increase of PHA665752 concentration, the cells may attach to the bottom of the culture dish. In such situations, a cell-scraper can be used to detach the cells.\nFinally, culture the PC-9 cells resistant to both gefitinib and PHA665752 in the growth medium with 1 µM each of gefitinib and PHA665752 in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.\nPerform the MTT assay to confirm that the cells are dual-resistant to gefitinib and PHA66575213, and that they are not sensitive to PHA665752 in the presence of gefitinib; these dual-resistance cells were named PC-9DR (designated as DR cells) (Figure 5).\nSubscription Required.
