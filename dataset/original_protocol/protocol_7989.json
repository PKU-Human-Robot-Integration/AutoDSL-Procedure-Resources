    "1. Setup\nGather necessary equipment including decapitation scissors, blunt forceps, dissection scissors, vascular scissors, microspatula, sagittal mouse brain matrix, razor blades, 200 µL pipet tips, glass petri dish, glass slide, and ice bucket. Lay out all equipment on an absorbent pad.\nPlace petri dish, glass plate, and brain matrix on ice.\nUsing a razor blade at a perpendicular angle, trim about 5 mm off the tip of one 200 µL pipet tip. This makes the size of the opening at the end of the tip about 1 mm wide. This should be sufficient to punch out the DCN. But this can also be adjusted as needed depending on the dissection. Have many tips ready for easy replacement and adjustment.\nLabel 1.5 mL microfuge tubes with animal identification and cerebellar region (four tubes per animal).\nFill cryosafe container with liquid nitrogen to flash freeze tissue after extraction.\n2. Brain extraction and dissection\nAll experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care Committees of the University of Minnesota.\nEuthanize the mouse using 5% CO2 exposure. Once breathing has ceased, perform cervical dislocation. Decapitate the mouse with the decapitation scissors and discard the carcass in the appropriate receptacle.\nMake an incision with a razor blade along the medial sagittal line of the head starting at the nose and continuing all the way back. Separate the skin, parting to either side of the midline. Use the razor blade to cut away the muscle on each side, cutting down past the ear canals.\nUsing dissecting scissors, trim any spinal cord regions, up to where the brain stem meets the cerebellum, careful to not damage the cerebellum.",
    "Insert one of the vascular scissor blades into the space between the brainstem and vertebral column and cut toward the ear canal, lifting up on the scissors to cleanly cut the bone but limit damage to the tissue.\nContinue to cut along the edge of the skull up toward the olfactory bulbs, continuing to lift up while cutting to limit damage to the brain tissue.\nUsing the blunt forceps, gently peel off the back of the skull uncovering the posterior region of the brain and cerebellum.\nUsing the blunt forceps along the edge of the skull that was just cut, peel the rest of the skull up and over the brain. This step should remove the majority of the skull cap, revealing the brain.\nTrim the rest of the skull with the vascular scissors and blunt forceps, clearing most of the skull from the top of the brain.\nUsing the microspatula, lift the brain slightly and scoop under and slide up to remove the olfactory bulbs from the remaining skull and disconnect optic tract fibers. Brain should come free easily at this point.\nPlace the brain into the petri dish sitting on ice and remove any remaining skull or other debris.\nUsing the microspatula, gently place the brain into the brain matrix with dorsal side up. Take time to make sure it is set level in the matrix, especially that the midline falls center in the matrix. This matrix is designed for adult mouse brain tissue, tissue from younger or diseased animals may rest lower in the matrix but it should still be possible to achieve reproducible results across samples.\nPlace one razor blade along the sagittal midline, making sure that the blade pushes all the way to the bottom of the matrix (Figure 1B).",
    "Place another razor blade 1 mm to the side of the first blade (Figure 1B). Place two more blades 1 mm apart from each other. The end result should be three blades placed on one side of the brain, all 1mm apart. Do the same to the other side. In total, 7 blades will be placed 1mm apart (Figure 1C).\nCarefully, grab the front and back ends of the razor blades and lift straight up out of the matrix. The tissue on the outside of the razor blades can be discarded.\nSlowly, separate one razor blade at a time from the others, being careful not to damage the tissue sections.\nCarefully slide the tissue section off of the razor blade and onto the glass slide with the microspatula. In total there will be six sagittal brain sections (Figure 1D).\nThe 4 most lateral sections will have DCN visible (Purple box, Figure 1D). To isolate the DCN, hold the trimmed 200 µL pipet tip perpendicularly over the DCN and push down through the tissue firmly, rocking in all directions to fully dissect the DCN from surrounding tissue. Lift straight back up to cleanly remove the DCN, and visually confirm the presence of the tissue in the tip.\nPlace one finger at the top of the tip and push down, causing the tissue to bulge out. Place the tip into correctly labeled microfuge tube and ensure that tissue punch is placed in the bottom of the tube. Repeat 2.17 for the remaining three sections, placing the DCN punches in the same tube. Place the tube into liquid nitrogen to flash freeze. Representation of size of each punch in Figure 1E.",
    "Sections that had DCN extracted qualify as cerebellar hemisphere. Push away the rest of the brain tissue around the cerebellum in these sections. Use blunt forceps and gently pick up these hemisphere cerebellar cortex sections and place into respective microfuge tube. Flash freeze.\nFor the last two vermal sections (light blue box, Figure1D), push away surrounding brain tissue leaving only the cerebellum. Using a razor blade, make a cut separating the anterior lobules from the posterior lobules. Cut should be just after the formation of lobule 6 and should not include lobule 10 (Figure 1F).\nUsing blunt forceps, carefully place the anterior cerebellar cortex sections and posterior cerebellar cortex sections into their respective microfuge tubes and flash freeze by leaving the tubes in liquid nitrogen for 5 minutes. From here move forward to RNA extraction, or may  store the tubes at -80 ˚C.\n3. RNA extraction \nNOTE: This protocol is modified from the Cold Spring Harbor Protocol for RNA Extraction with TRIzol20. TRIzol solubilizes biological material, making it possible to extract RNA.\nPlace the microfuge tubes in ice to keep the tissue from thawing too quickly, apply 150 µL of cold TRIzol in the microfuge tube. Homogenize with a sterilized pestle. Once tissue is homogenized, pipet the solution up and down to ensure there is no remaining tissue intact. Further break up any small tissue pieces by pulling it up into an insulin syringe a few times.\nAdd another 350 µL of TRIzol and pipet up and down to mix thoroughly. Let sit at room temp for 5 minutes.\nAdd 150 µL of chloroform to the tube and shake vigorously and then let rest for 2-3 minutes. The chloroform separates the homogenized tissue solution into phases (RNA, DNA, and protein).",
    "Centrifuge at 12,000 x g, at 15˚C, for 10 minutes. Ensure that all tubes are at the same orientation.\nCarefully remove the tubes and set the temperature of the centrifuge to 4˚C. Remove only the clear aqueous phase into a new tube (this is the RNA), careful not to disrupt the opaque interphase (the DNA).  The lowest phase will be red and contains protein. Remaining solution in the tubes can be saved or discarded.\nAdd 100% isopropyl alcohol at a 1:2 ratio (if removed 200 ul of aqueous phase, add 100 µL of isopropyl alcohol). Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down. Let rest at room temperature for 10 minutes. The isopropyl alcohol precipitates the RNA out of solution.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g, at 4˚C, for 10 minutes. Be sure to place all the tubes at the same orientation to make it easier to visualize the pellet. The resulting pellet will be the extracted RNA.\nCarefully remove the tubes, remove the supernatant with a pipet being careful not to disrupt the pellet. The pellet is somewhat gel-like and will be difficult to see, but should be able to estimate where it is based on the orientation of the tubes in the centrifuge.\nAfter removing all of the supernatant, add 500 µL of 75% ethanol, vortex briefly, and centrifuge at 7500 x g, at 4˚C, for 5 minutes. The ethanol further washes the pellet.\nRemove the supernatant carefully, without disrupting the pellet. Leave caps open to dry the sample. This usually takes 5-10 minutes but can vary depending on how much ethanol was left on the pellet. Do not over dry.\nOnce dry, resuspend the pellet in DNase free water. Add 20 µL to samples for DCN, and 30 µL for all others.",
    "Once resuspended, samples can be stored at -80 ˚C or proceed to further testing.\n4. Real Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTqPCR)\nBefore this step it will be necessary to DNase treat the RNA to remove any genomic DNA, and generate cDNA utilizing iScript from BioRad. Be sure to normalize the concentration of RNA before making the cDNA. In addition, it is important to optimize primers for qPCR. Follow the methods described here to complete this step21. Brief description of the qPCR below.\nPrimers are all purchased from IDT. Forward and reverse sequences are both in the same sample tube, and stored at 20x concentration.\n\tRps18 (control gene):\n\tForward – 5’-CCTGAGAAGTTCCAGCACAT-3’\n\tReverse – 5’-ACACCACATGAGCATATCTCC-3'\n\tParvalbumin (Calcium binding protein, inhibitory cells):\n\tForward – ‘5-ATGAGGTGAAGAAGGTGTTCC-3’\n\tReverse – ‘5-AGCGTCTTTGTTTCTTTAGCAG-3’\n\tKcng4 (Potassium channel subunit):\n\tForward – 5’-CTGTCTTTTCCTGGTCAGTGA-3’\n\tReverse – 5’-GCATTGCCTCAGACTGTCAG-3’\n\tAldolase C (Zebrin II, differentially expressed across the cerebellar cortex):\n\tForward – 5’-AGAGGACAAAGGGATAATGCTG-3’\n\tReverse – 5’-TCAGTAGGCATGGTTGGC-3’\nqPCR conditions were as follows. Pre-incubation period, 5 minutes, at 95˚C. Amplification period, 50 cycles: 10 minutes at 95˚C, 10 minutes at 62˚C, and 10 minutes at 72˚C. Melting curve period, 5 seconds at 95˚C, one minute at 65˚C, and set ramp rate to .07˚C/second until target temp of 97˚C. Then cooling period for 10 minutes to 40˚C.  All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate and gene expression was analyzed using 2- ΔΔCt with Rps18 as a loading control to normalize gene expression. Bulk cerebellar extract was used as a reference.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
