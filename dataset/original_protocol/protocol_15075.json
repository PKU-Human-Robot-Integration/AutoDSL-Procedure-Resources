    "1. Emergency Response at the Dispatch Center of the Berlin Fire Brigade\nAnswer an incoming \"112\" emergency call.\nGather information about the emergency site, such as address, floor, name on the doorbell and phone number. Type the data directly into the worksheet of the computer-controlled emergency dispatch system (called Ignis)\nIdentify the medical emergency as a stroke emergency, using the newly developed Dispatcher Identification Algorithm for Stroke Emergencies (DIASE).\nVerify that the emergency site is within the operating area of STEMO via Ignis.\nCommunicate alarm to STEMO via a radio-based alarm system. (In Berlin, currently, a regular care ambulance is alarmed simultaneously.) Available information concerning the emergency is automatically transmitted via fax.\n2. Receipt of the Alarm Transmission at the Fire Station\nA personal pager signals the alert by audible tone. Go immediately to the fax machine and take the fax containing the detailed emergency information.\nGo to the STEMO vehicle, press the status button 3 on the on-board radio, thus confirming a receipt for alert to the dispatch center. The GPS-based navigation system has automatically received a routing to the patient's location.\nWhen complete crew is on board (Paramedic, Neurologist and Radiology technician) drive the STEMO vehicle to the emergency site. CAUTION: Approach with blue lights flashing and siren to the scene. Therefore, pay particular attention to other road users and observe the regulations of the German traffic law concerning the use of blue lights and siren.\nUpon arrival at the emergency site, press the status button 4 on the on-board radio, thus giving a confirmation to the dispatch center.\nPay extra attention to safety before leaving the STEMO vehicle at the emergency site. CAUTION: Watch out for potential hazards, such as unsecured scene of an accident, violent people, risk of fire, moving traffic or hazardous substances.",
    "3. Examination of the Patient at the Emergency Site\nCheck consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).\nFollow the structured \"ABCDE algorithm\" for the initial assessment of the patient's status: Airways, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure13.\nExplore medical history of the patient. If stroke is suspected clinically assess severity of symptoms using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).\nDetermine the exact onset of symptoms by questioning the patient/witnesses.\nAsk for current medication with a main focus on anticoagulation therapy.\nMeasure and log the vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar concentration, and oxygen saturation.\n4. Insert a Peripheral Intravenous (IV) Line and Perform Blood Withdrawals\nApply a tourniquet around the upper arm.\nSearch for a suitable hand, forearm, or antecubital vein. The best choice for the iv line is a vein on the dorsum of the hand.\nDisinfect the skin.\nRemove needle sheath from the indwelling venous catheter. Ensure needle bevel is upwards.\nApply traction distal to the vein to prevent vein from rolling during cannulation.\nInsert the needle into the vein at 20-40°. The flashback of blood confirms that the needle tip is inside the vein. Advance the catheter off the needle into the vein.\nFix the catheter using adhesive tape.\nRemove the needle, discard it to a sharps container and connect a plastic adapter containing a shrouded needle, which enables to start with a blood draw from the indwelling venous catheter.\nPerform blood draw using several Vacutainer blood test tubes. Some of these blood tubes contain different anticoagulatory additives, such as EDTA, citrate and heparine. The type of blood test tube is color-coded: 1. Purple for complete blood counts; 2. Blue for coagulatory assays; 3. Green for electrolytes, BUN, and other basic blood parameters; 4. Orange for specialized serum analysis.",
    "Push a Vacutainer blood test tube into the plastic holder, so that its rubber cap is pierced by the shrouded needle. (The negative pressure in the Vacutainer tubes forces blood into the blood test tubes.)\nRemove the Vacutainer tube after it was filled with blood and repeat this procedure with the other Vacutainer tubes.\nAfter the last Vacutainer tube was filled, remove the tourniquet, flush the indwelling venous catheter with normal saline solution, and close the catheter using a closing cone.\n5. Determine the International Normalized Ratio (INR), using a Bedside Point-of-care Analyzer\nTake a test strip from its container. Slide it into the guide in the direction indicated by the arrows.\nTake a lancet and twist the protective cap off. Press the tip of the lancet against the side of the fingertip and press the trigger button.\nApply the blood sample on the target area of the test strip within 15 sec of sticking the fingertip. After a few seconds the result (INR) is displayed.\nPlace the used strip and the lancet into containers for biohazards and sharps, respectively.\n6. Advanced Diagnostics and Intervention\nImmediately transfer the patient into the STEMO vehicle.\nPosition the patient on a stretcher.\nInsert the purple Vacutainer blood test tube into the point-of-care laboratory (Horiba ABX Micros 60). Measure additional blood parameters such as platelet count, total leukocyte count, erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, electrolytes.\nInsert the patient's insurance card into the card reader (installed in the control room).\nCall the neuroradiologist on-call to discuss the indication for CT scanning and prepare for examination.\nExplain benefits and risks of CT scanning to the patient. Afterwards, obtain informed consent from the patient, if possible.",
    "Start the CT. CAUTION: X-ray radiation is released from the CT scanner. Radiology technician has to be in the shielded control room. The rest of the STEMO staff is requested to leave the vehicle during the examination in order to avoid unnecessary exposure to x-ray radiation (STEMO vehicle is lead covered). Furthermore, protective measures (eye protection) should be applied to the patient.\nTransmit the CT image via on-board telemetric infrastructure and request teleradiological support for decision making regarding diagnosis and therapy. (Parallel analysis of images in the STEMO by the neurologist.)\nAsk the patient for contraindications against thrombolytic therapy using a standardized check list.\nExplain benefits and possible risks of thrombolysis. Inform the patient that the treatment is part of a clinical study and obtain informed consent, if possible.\n7. Administration of Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rtPA or Alteplase)\nCalculate the dose of alteplase (trade name: Actilyse) based on the best approximation of bodyweight available. The recommended dose is 0.9 mg/kg bodyweight. Maximum dose is 90 mg6.\nReconstitute the dry solid alteplase using the solvent provided. Use the transfer cannula, which must be introduced vertically into the rubber stopper of the phials and through the mark at its center.\nDissolve the dry solid by gentle agitation.\nInitiate thrombolysis by administering 10% of the calculated total dose as a bolus injection over 1 min. Keep record of the point in time, when alteplase bolus is injected. CAUTION: Pay attention to immediate allergic responses following administration. Be prepared to administer antiallergic drugs (i.e. antihistaminics, high-dose glucocorticoids, catecholamines) in case of an acute allergic response. In general, alteplase should be used only by a physician experienced in the treatment of ischemic stroke6.",
    "Inject the remaining dose via an injection pump syringe continuously over 60 min (after evacuation of the tubing to avoid the injection of air bubbles).\n8. Transportation of the Patient to a Suitable Hospital\nMake an advanced notification to the emergency room of the closest hospital with a certified stroke unit.\nStart the transportation immediately. Communicate the selected hospital to the dispatch center via radio.\nMonitor neurological deficits and vital signs during transfer to the hospital.\nPrint out and sign the admission letter (using Vimed software) including diagnosis, history, results of neurological examination, neuroradiological report (sent by the neuroradiologist on call via UMTS), results of laboratory investigations, and description of actions taken. Copy CT-scan on a CD for the hospital.\nOn arrival at the hospital (press status button 8) provide concise present and past medical histories of the patient to the neurologist on-call and to the primary team in the Emergency Room. Hand over printed report, CD containing CT images (step 8.4), and the blood-filled blue, green and orange Vacutainer blood test tubes (step 4.9).\n9. Restoring the Operational Readiness\nClean and disinfect hands and all equipment that has been used during the EMS response.\nReport operational stand-by status to the dispatch center using button 1 on the onboard radio. Return to the local fire station."
