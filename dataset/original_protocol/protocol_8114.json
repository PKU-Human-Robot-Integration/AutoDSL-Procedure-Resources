    "1. Culture and Storage of Human Periventricular Endothelial Cells\nMaintain human periventricular endothelial cells on basement membrane matrix-coated (see Table of Materials) 6-well plates in periventricular endothelial cell medium (E6 medium containing 50 ng/mL VEGF-A, 100 ng/mL FGF2 and 5 µM GABA) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Change medium every alternate day.\nThaw basement membrane matrix in 4 °C, and make a 1:100 solution by diluting it in cold DMEM/F12 medium. Coat each well of a 6-well plate with 1 mL of matrix solution. Incubate plates at 37 °C for at least 1 h before use.\nAllow human periventricular endothelial cells to reach a confluency of 80%-90%. Aspirate medium from the well. Wash the wells once with 1 mL of sterile 1x PBS per well.\nDetach cells by adding 1 mL of cell dissociation solution (see Table of Materials) per well. Incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. After 5 min, add 1 mL of periventricular endothelial cell medium. Transfer the cell solution into a 15 mL conical tube.\n\tNOTE: We use Accutase for cell dissociation here, as opposed to TrypLE in sections 3 and 4.\nCentrifuge cells at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of periventricular endothelial cell medium.\nCount live cells using the trypan blue exclusion method. Seed cells in fresh matrix-coated plates at a density of 1.2 x 105 cells/cm2. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nStore human periventricular endothelial cells by cryopreserving in freezing medium (90% periventricular endothelial cell medium and 10% DMSO).\n\t\nDissociate and collect cells following steps 1.3 and 1.4 above. Count cells in the solution by the trypan blue exclusion method.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 500 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet at 5 x 106 cells/ mL of freezing medium.\nDispense 1 mL of freezing medium plus cells per cryovial. Place the vials in isopropanol-filled chamber and cool overnight in -80 °C at 1 °C/min. Transfer vials to a liquid nitrogen tank on the next day for long term storage.\n2. Preparation of Human Periventricular Endothelial Cells for Assay\nAllow human periventricular endothelial cells to reach 70%-80% confluency.\nDissociate cells following steps 1.3 to 1.5 as described above. Count cells using the trypan blue exclusion method.\n3. Preparation of Human GABAergic Interneurons for Assay\nNOTE: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived GABAergic interneurons and the neuronal medium were commercially purchased (see Table of Materials). The neurons are generated by differentiating a human fibroblast-derived iPSC line following a protocol developed by the manufacturer. The cells were thawed and cultured according to manufacturer's protocol.\nThaw human GABAergic interneurons and culture them in 12-well plate for two weeks to a confluency of 70%-80%.\nOn the day of the assay, warm cell dissociation solution (see Table of Materials) and an aliquot of neuronal medium at 37 °C for 10 min before use.\nAspirate medium from each well containing the cells. Wash cells with 1 mL of sterile 1x PBS per well.\nDetach cells by adding 0.5 mL of pre-warmed dissociation solution per well and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Add 1 mL of neuronal medium per well. Transfer cell solution into a 15 mL conical tube. Gently triturate to dissociate cell clumps.",
    "Centrifuge cells at 380 x g for 5 min at room temperature, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of neuronal medium. Count live cells using the trypan blue exclusion method.\n4. Preparation of Control Human Endothelial Cells for Assay\nNOTE: Control human iPSC-derived endothelial cells and endothelial cell medium were commercially purchased (Table of Materials). These endothelial cells are generated by differentiating a human fibroblast-derived iPSC line to endothelial fate following a protocol developed by the manufacturer. The cells were thawed and cultured on Fibronectin substrate according to manufacturer's protocol. Fibronectin-coated plates were prepared following manufacturer's protocol.\nThaw control human endothelial cells and culture them in 6-well plate to a confluency of 80%-90%.\nOn the day of the assay, warm cell dissociation solution (see Table of Materials) and an aliquot of endothelial medium at 37 °C for 10 min before use.\nAspirate the medium from each well containing the cells. Wash cells with 1 mL of sterile 1x PBS per well.\nDetach cells by adding 0.5 mL of pre-warmed dissociation solution per well. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.

Aspirate supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of endothelial cell medium. Count live cells using the trypan blue exclusion method.\n5. Preparation of One-well Culture Inserts\nThaw 1 mg/mL laminin solution at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nCoat an appropriate number of 35 mm dishes with 0.01% poly-L-ornithine solution (1 mL per dish). Incubate the dishes in room temperature for at least 1 h.",
    "Dilute 1 mg/mL laminin solution 1:300 in sterile water to a final concentration of 3.3 µg/mL immediately before use.\nCompletely aspirate poly-L-ornithine from each dish. Rinse each dish thoroughly 3x with sterile water and aspirate completely to avoid poly-L-ornithine-induced cell toxicity.\nAdd 1 mL of 3.3 µg/mL laminin solution to each dish and incubate at 37 °C overnight or at least 1 h. Remove laminin solution from the dish immediately before use.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, store the laminin-containing dishes in 4 °C. Equilibrate the dishes in a 37 °C cell culture incubator before use.\nCut three sides of one well of a two-well silicone culture insert (Figure 1A) using a sterile blade to generate a one-well insert (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: Keep the two-well insert firmly attached to the surface of the original packaging while cutting to ensure a smooth cut and protect the adhesiveness of the insert.\nAspirate laminin solution from the dishes.\n\tNOTE: Do not wash the dishes with sterile PBS or water after laminin incubation. Wet surfaces will prevent tight adhesion of the culture insert.\nRemove one-well insert with sterile tweezers and place it in the center of the poly-L-ornithine/laminin coated dish. Press along the edges of the insert to fix it to the surface of the dish.\nCarefully turn the dish upside down to verify that the insert is firmly adhered.\nKeep the dish upside down and mark the boundary of the insert compartment using a permanent black marker with an ultra-fine tip (Figure 1C).\n6.

    "Co-suspend 3 x 104 GABAergic interneurons and 3 x 104 human periventricular endothelial cells in 70 µL of co-culture medium (50% periventricular maintenance medium without GABA and 50% neuronal medium). Seed this cell solution inside the one-well insert compartment. Prepare an appropriate number of such assay dishes.\n\tNOTE: GABA was not added in the co-culture medium to exclude the effect of exogenous GABA on migration.\nCheck under a microscope to verify that cells are not leaking from the insert compartment.\nSlowly add 1 mL of co-culture medium along the side of the dish to prevent the coating from drying.\n\tNOTE: Add medium slowly along the edge of the dish so that the insert is not disturbed.\nAs a first control, seed 3 x 104 human GABAergic interneurons only in 70 µL of co-culture medium per one-well insert. Prepare an appropriate number of such dishes.\nAs a second control, co-seed 3 x 104 GABAergic human interneurons with 3 x 104 control human endothelial cells in 70 µL of co-culture medium per one-well insert.

Imaging and Data Analysis\nPlace the immuno-stained assay dish under a microscope at 4X magnification.\nKeep one long-edge of the rectangular boundary (made in step 5.10 above) in the field of view. Take images of cells in the cell-free space adjacent to that boundary. Acquire images along the right long-edge and the left long-edge of the rectangular boundary (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: Cells positioned diagonally with respect to the rectangle are not considered due to ambiguity in selecting the short- or long-edge as starting mark. Also, numbers of cells migrating across the short-edge are often significantly fewer (possibly due to lesser number of starting cells along the short-edge) and are not considered.\nOpen the images in ImageJ. Calculate distance between each cell and the boundary mark (Figure 2D) using ImageJ.\nTo assess migration in terms of cell numbers, set a specific distance from the boundary in the acquired image in ImageJ. Count the number of cells that are present within this distance. Calculate average number, standard deviation, and statistical significance using appropriate software.\nSubscription Required.
