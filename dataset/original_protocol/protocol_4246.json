    "Remove the lyophilised siRNA library (76 x 96-well plates) from storage at -80 °C and equilibrate to room temperature.Pellet well contents by centrifuging for 10 min at 1,000 rpm and replace plate seals with clean plastic lids.Clean a Multidrop 384 dispensing cassette with 3 x 25 ml 70% ethanol and rinse with 3 x 50 ml sterile DNase and RNase-free water.Prepare a sufficient volume of 1x siRNA buffer by diluting 5x siRNA buffer in sterile DNase and RNase-free water.Resuspend the 0.5 nmol siRNA library to 3 µM by dispensing 165 µl 1x siRNA buffer to columns 3-12 of the siRNA library plates (96-well plates) (see Note 1; Figure 1A).Using a label maker, print text or barcode labels for 384-well Master Plates (see Note 2).Adhere labels to 384-well storage plates (for a library of 76 x 96-well plates you will need 19 x 384-well storage plates and labels). These will be the 384-well Master Plates. Clean a dispensing cassette for the Multidrop 384, as above, and dispense 110 µl 1x siRNA buffer into columns 1 and 2 of the 384-well Master plate (see Note 3; Figure 1B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140817/20140817015231_9056.jpgFigure 1. 96 and 384-well plate preparationDilute the assay-specific siRNA controls to 300 nM in 1x siRNA buffer (see Note 4).Manually transfer 110 µl of each siRNA control, in horizontal duplicates, to columns 3 and 4 in every 384-well Master Plate i.e. transfer RSCF siRNA to wells A3 and A4; transfer non-targeting siRNA to wells B3 and B4 etc. (Figure 1C).Dispense 100 µl 1x siRNA buffer to columns 5-24 in each 384-well master plate using a Multidrop 384.",
    "Using a robotic liquid handler (such as the QIAGEN RapidPlate 384), with an individual box of Zymark robotic tips for each siRNA 96-well Library Plate, transfer 11 µl from the siRNA library plates (3 µM siRNA) to the 384-well Master plate. Each 384-well plate takes 4 x 96-well siRNA Library plates (Figure 1D). These plates can be stored at -80 °C until needed.Use a microplate heat sealer and aluminium heat seals to seal the siRNA library plates before transferring to a -80 °C for long-term storage.Print appropriate barcode or text labels for the 384-well assay plates containing relevant information (replicate number, assay type etc.) (see Note 5).Stick labels to black, tissue-culture treated, flat, clear-bottomed 384-well plates.If frozen, thaw the 384-well Master Plates and briefly centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 rpm before transferring 10 µl to three replicate assay plates using a robotic liquid handler and an individual box of Zymark robotic tips for each quadrant of the 384-well plate.Cover prepared assay plates with an adhesive plate seal, place in sealable bags and stored at -80 °C for up to 2 weeks before use (see Note 6). Calculate the number of low passage Hela cells in a confluent T175 flask, and the total number of cells required for your assay. Based on these numbers determine the number of 50% confluent T175 flasks required to provide the total number of cells for your assay. Several days before your assay, prepare Hela cells such that there will be sufficient 100% confluent T175 flasks the day before the siRNA transfection.The day before transfection, remove medium from the confluent T715 flasks of Hela cells, and rinse cells with warmed sterile phosphate buffered saline.Discard wash, and dislodge cells by incubating for around 5 min at 37 °C in 5 ml pre-warmed trypsin.",
    "Inactivate trypsin by adding 10 ml growth medium and transfer the pre-determined volume of cells to sufficient T175 flasks such that they will be 50% confluent the following day (see Note 7).The next day, thaw the replicate assay plates and centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 rpm. Remove the plate seals and cover with lids.Dilute the Dharmafect 1 (DF1) transfection reagent to 0.6% in the appropriate volume of HBSS and add 10 µl to each well of the 384-well assay plates using a dispensing cassette for the Multidrop 384.Centrifuge the assay plates for 1 min at 1,000 rpm and incubate at room temperature for 20 min for transfection complexes to form. Remove growth medium from the Hela cells, rinse in PBS and dislodge cells by incubating for ~5 min at 37 °C in 5 ml trypsin.Inactivate the trypsin by adding 10 ml of transfection medium.Mix each flask well and pool together all cells before mixing well and removing 5 x 12 μl aliquots of cell suspension for counting in a disposable hemocytometer. Calculate the average cell density and dilute to 7.5 x 104 cells/ml.After the 20 min incubation time, transfer 40 µl cells to every well in the assay plates and incubate plate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C for 48 h to ensure gene depletion prior to investigating your assay output.After 48 h, determine the effect of gene depletion on cell viability.Thaw the CellTitre Blue reagent (or equivalent) and add 5 µl per well of each Cell Viability replicate plate using the Multidrop 384.Return the plates to the 37 °C incubator for 2 h before measuring the fluorescence signal (485 nm) of each plate using a POLARstar OPTIMA plate reader (or equivalent).",
    "The effect of siRNA depletion on cell viability is determined by comparing fluorescence to the average fluorescence of mock-transfected cells (columns 1 and 2) (see Note 8). To infect the duplicate assay plates with HSV-1-eGFP, thaw theHSV-1-eGFP virus stock in a 37 °C water bath until just thawed, before diluting to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 in phenol red-free DMEM: F12/15 mM HEPES/L-glutamine/5% FCS/pen-strep (see Note 9).Remove media from all plates by inverting and shaking over a suitable liquid waste container.Add 10 µl phenol red-free growth medium to columns 1 and 2 of every plate manually using a low volume (2-10 µl) 8-channel multichannel pipette (see Note 10). Add 10 µl diluted virus to the remaining wells (columns 3-24) using a Multidrop 384 and centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 rpm to remove air bubbles and ensure the cell monolayer is covered by the small volume of inoculum.Transfer infection assay plates to the 37 °C incubator for 1 h to allow virus to adsorb before adding 50 µl phenol red-free growth medium to every well using the Multidrop 384.Cover the plates with a gas-permeable adhesive seal, stack and cover the top plate with a plastic lid before returning all assay plates to the incubator for 20 h.Place assay plates in the stacker equipment of a fluorescence plate reader and monitor virus replication as a measure of GFP fluorescence in a fluorescent plate reader every 3-4 h until replication plateaus (see Note 11).Once the virus replication cycle has completed, calculate the replication slope over the linear phase of growth for each well and determine the effect of gene depletion on virus replication by comparing the replication slope to the average replication slope of control wells (mock, RSCF and non-targeting siRNA-transfected) on a per plate basis.",
    "The LINEST equation in Microsfot Excel can be used to calculate replication slopes. This formula utilises the ‘known x’ values (the hours post-infection) and the ‘known y’ values (the relative fluorescence at each time post-infection). Firstly, generate a table with the ‘Hours post-infection’ and the relative fluorescence of your samples (Figure 1A). Plot these data and identify the linear phase of replication (Figure 1B; red line indicates linear phase). Use the linest formula to calculate the replication slope, and normalise the slope of each condition to that of your control 9in this example, normalise to ‘Mock’ transfected cells; Figure 1C-D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140817/20140817015252_8886.jpgFigure 2.
