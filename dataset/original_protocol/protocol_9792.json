    "The specimens from human tissue were collected according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and observing University Hospital \"Federico II\" guidelines. All patients involved in this study provided written consent forms.\n1. Preparation of solutions\nPreparation of 1200 mL of 1% decellularizing solution\n\t\nPrepare 600 mL of 2% Triton X-100 solution by measuring 588 mL of double-distilled water in a graduated cylinder and transferring it to a 1 L beaker. Using a serological pipette, add 12 mL of Triton X-100 and a stir bar to the beaker. Place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer and mix the solution until the Triton X-100 is completely dissolved.\nStop the agitation. Remove the stir bar using a stir bar retriever. Store at room temperature.\nPrepare 600 mL of 2% SDS solution by measuring 550 mL of double-distilled water in a graduated cylinder and transferring it to a 1 L beaker.\nWeigh 12 g of SDS powder in a plastic weighing boat and transfer it to the beaker containing the double-distilled water in step 1.1.3.\n\t\tNOTE: Step 1.1.4 must be performed under a chemical hood, and the user should wear personal protective equipment.\nAdd a stir bar, place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer, and mix the solution until the SDS is completely dissolved.\nStop the agitation process. Remove the stir bar using a stir bar retriever.\nTransfer the solution to a graduated cylinder and adjust the volume to 600 mL by adding double-distilled water.\nPour 2% Triton X-100 solution prepared in step 1.1.1 into a 2 L cylinder.\nPour 2% SDS solution prepared in steps 1.1.3-1.1.7 into the same 2 L cylinder to obtain a total volume of 1200 mL.\nCover with parafilm and mix gently by inversion to obtain a homogeneous solution.",
    "Transfer the mixed solution to a 2 L bottle using a funnel to avoid the formation of foam. Store the solution at +4 °C.\nPreparation of 1x phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS)\n\t\nPrepare 500 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) by dissolving 0.1 g of potassium phosphate monobasic, 0.1 g of potassium chloride, 4.0 g of sodium chloride, and 0.575 g of sodium phosphate dibasic in sterile double-distilled water. Check the pH value (7.4).\nStore at +4 °C until use.\nPreparation of antibiotic solution\n\t\nWeigh 625 µg of amphotericin B in a plastic weighing boat.\nPipette 8 mL of a penicillin and streptomycin (pen/strep) mixture into a 15 mL tube.\nAdd the weighed amphotericin B to the pen/strep mixture, and adjust the volume to 10 mL by adding penicillin and streptomycin (pen/strep) mixture. Cap the tube and dissolve the amphotericin B by shaking vigorously.\n2. Day 1 - start the decellularization procedure.\nPour 400 mL of the decellularizing solution into a 500 mL beaker.\nAdd 2.0 mL of the antibiotic solution.\n3. Preparation of skin samples\nWash the human skin sample from the abdomen of patients undergoing abdominoplasty in a plastic tray by shacking and turning it upside down in a 0.9% NaCl isotonic physiological solution to remove excess blood and other biological fluids.\nRemove hair using fine forceps and fat using large surgical scissors.\nPlace the skin sample on the dissecting board and dissect it using a scalpel, with the graduations on the dissecting board as a reference to obtain 3 cm x 2.5 cm fragments (length by width), avoiding scars and dirty or burned areas of the tissue.\nPlace each fragment in an embedding cassette, close it, and make sure all the cassettes are appropriately locked to avoid leakage of the sample during the decellularization procedure.",
    "Place a maximum of four embedding cassettes with samples in a beaker with the decellularizing solution. Add a stir bar. Cover with aluminum foil, writing on the top all the information to identify the sample and the starting time of the procedure.\nPlace the beaker on the magnetic stirrer and start the agitation at a rotational velocity of 150 rpm. Stop the agitation. Remove the aluminum foil covering the beaker and take the embedding cassettes out with long forceps.\n\tNOTE: After stopping the agitation, check the clarity of the solution. Modify the duration of the agitation (less or more than 8 hours) based on the degree of the clouding due to the release of cellular debris.\nPlace each cassette in a 100 mm dish. Replace the decellularizing solution by repeating steps 3.5-3.6 overnight.\n4. Day 2 - check the state of the skin samples.\nStop the agitation process. Remove the aluminum foil covering the beaker and take the embedding cassettes out with long forceps.\nPlace each cassette in a 100 mm dish and open it. Check the color of the sample.\n\tNOTE: The samples might show a color change from the native beige to snow-white.\nRemove residual hair and detach the epidermis from the dermis. Replace the decellularizing solution by repeating steps 3.5-3.6.\nStop the agitation after 8 h. Repeat steps 4.1-4.2 until the sample appears snow-white. Stop the decellularizing procedure.\n\tNOTE: The time of exposure to the action of detergents can be extended if needed.\nMeasure 400 mL of 1x PBS in a 500 mL cylinder, pour it into a 500 mL beaker, and add 2 mL of the Pen Strep/Amphotericin B mixture. Add a stir bar.",
    "Place a maximum of four cassettes containing the samples in each beaker with the 1x PBS/antibiotics solution. Cover with aluminum foil and write all the information on the top as in step 3.5.\nPlace the beaker on a magnetic stirrer and start the agitation at a rotational velocity of 150 rpm overnight, at room temperature.\n5. Day 3 - a final wash of the samples\nStop the agitation. Replace the 1x PBS solution with 400 mL of double-distilled water. Add a stir bar. Cover with aluminum foil and write all the information on top as in step 3.5.\nPlace the beaker on a magnetic stirrer and start the agitation at a rotational velocity of 150 rpm for 30 min.\nStop the agitation process. Remove the aluminum foil covering the beaker and take the embedding cassettes out with long forceps.\nPlace each embedding cassette containing the decellularized skin sample in a 100 mm dish. Open the cassettes and gently dry the skin samples by dabbing them on laboratory wipes.\nPlace each decellularized skin sample in a weighing boat previously tagged with the information about the sample. Cover the boat with aluminum foil and write all the information on the top to identify the sample. Store at - 80 °C.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
