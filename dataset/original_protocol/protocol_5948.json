    "Germination of tomato seedling (Figure 1)Take tomato seeds and wash them with sterile distilled water.Soak seeds in sterile distilled water for 48 h at room temperature of ~25 to 30 °C (Figure 1A).Spread soaked seeds on cotton and tissue bed in a plastic or glass tray, and then put the tray for germination in a growth chamber maintained at 28 °C, 75% RH and 12 h of photoperiod (Light intensity of the lamp as 1,350 lm and the color temperature as 4,000 K) (Figure 1B).Maintain the moisture of the seed bed by spraying sterile distilled water at regular interval during the seed germination.Note: The spray of sterile distilled water at regular interval help in better seedling growth and it also helps to prevent bacterial and/or fungal contamination. Pick the 6-7 days old tomato seedlings with similar size for infection assay.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181029/20181029190233_8398.jpgFigure 1. Pictures showing the different steps of root inoculation assay to study R. solanacearum pathogenicity in tomato seedlings. A. Soaking of tomato seeds in sterile distilled water for 48 h. B. Spreading of seeds on sterile and wet cotton and tissue paper bed. C. Germination of tomato seeds on a sterile and wet tissue paper bed in a growth chamber at 28 °C and 75% relative humidity up to the seedling stage. D. Root inoculation of tomato seedling by dipping the root in bacterium inoculums container. E. Each inoculated seedling transferred to sterile1.5-2 ml empty microfuge tubes. After approximately 5 min of air exposure, 1.0 to 1.5 ml of sterile water was added to each microfuge tube. F. Approximately 40-48 h post inoculation, infected seedlings started wilting indicating the early wilting symptom. G.",
    "On the 7th day post inoculation, 80% to 90% of infected tomato seedlings became permanently wilted and died (top side) in comparison to water as control (bottom side). Bacterial inoculum preparationStreak R. solanacearum (F1C1) bacterium on BG-Agar plate and incubate in an incubator (Orbitek, Scigenics Biotech (Pvt.) Ltd., India) maintained at 28 °C for 24 h.Add freshly grown R. solanacearum (F1C1) colonies to 50 ml BG broth in a sterile vial with a sterile loop and allow to grow in a shaking incubator (Orbitek, Scigenics Biotech (Pvt.) Ltd., India) maintained at 28 °C and 150 rpm for 24 h.Centrifuge the full-grown bacterial cultures at 4,000 rpm (3,155 x g) for 15 min at 4 °C and then discard the supernatant.Resuspend bacterial pellets in sterile distilled water and repeat Step B3 (centrifuge at 4,000 rpm [3,155 x g] for 15 min at 4 °C) to remove remaining culture media component from the suspension.Now resuspend bacterial pellet in an equal volume of sterile distilled water to obtain a concentration of ~109 CFU/ml. Now, this bacterial inoculum is ready for infection.Inoculation of R. solanacearum in 6-7 days old tomato seedlings (Figure 2)Pick 6-7 days old tomato seedlings with similar size from germination bed.Add 5-20 ml of bacterial inoculum into a wide mouth container.Immerse the seedling roots in bacterial inoculum up to the root-shoot junction for a few seconds.Now transfer these seedlings to an empty and sterile microfuge (1.5 or 2.0 ml) tube.Then air expose the seedlings for ~5 min (Here “air expose” means that pathogen inoculated seedlings are placed in a sterile empty microfuge tube for ~5 min before addition of water to the tube). Add 1 to 1.5 ml of sterile distilled water to the microfuge tube containing the air exposed seedlings.",
    "Inoculate seedlings in the same way with sterile distilled water as a negative control.Transfer all the inoculated as well as control seedlings to a growth chamber maintained at 28 °C, 75% RH, and 12 h of photoperiod.Start infection and disease progression analysis from the next day onwards till the 7th day post inoculation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181029/20181029190302_2159.jpgFigure 2. Schematic diagram of root inoculation of tomato seedlings in the R. solanacearum pathogenicity assay. Here, we are representing self-explanatory schematic diagram of pathogenicity assay for easy and better understanding of the crucial steps of the assay."
