Samples should be run on a BioAnalyzer, to check for the length distribution with a peak around 1,000 bp. Most of the fragments should distribute from 600–2,000 bp (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4384/bioprotoc-12-08-4384-g002.jpgFigure 2. Length distribution of circFL-seq cDNA library. For troubleshooting of low-quality libraries, see Table 1.Table 1. List of low-quality libraries. table:\n﻿0,1,2\nObservation,Possible cause,Comments and actions\nLow amount of library,RNA contamination or degradation,\"Before library construction, make sure RNA quality is good, based on assessment using electrophoresis and spectrophotometry.\"",
    "Low amount of library,Low recovery after beads clean-up,\"1. Clean beads settle quickly, so ensure they are well resuspended before adding them to the sample. 2. DNA will be eluted from the beads when using ethanol <70%. Make sure to use the correct percentage.\"\nMultiple peaks,rRNAs or linear RNA were not well depleted in step A,\"Design single-strand cDNA probes for residual RNA, as described in Morlan et al. (2012).\"\nNanopore library construction and sequencing The libraries can be handed to a sequencing facility. DNA library for barcoding and ligation sequencing was prepared following protocols EXP-NBD104 and SQK-LSK109.Repair and dA-tail 0.5–1 μg of circFL-seq cDNA, by NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix and NEBNext Ultra II End repair/dA-tailing Module, followed by purification with 1× DNA Clean Beads.For multiplexing, repaired and end-prepped DNA was barcoded with Native Barcode, by NEB Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix, followed by purification with 1× DNA Clean Beads.Pool barcoded samples together in equimolar amounts. Single samples without barcodes or pooled barcoded samples (700 ng) were ligated to an ONT Adapter, with NEBNext Quick Ligation Module, followed by purification with 0.4× DNA Clean Beads, and Short Fragment Buffer.Mix the DNA library with sequencing buffer, load beads onto a PromethION or MinION Flow Cell, and run on a PromethION or MinION sequencer. For the following data analysis, 5 million reads (about 5 Gbases) per sample are necessary."
