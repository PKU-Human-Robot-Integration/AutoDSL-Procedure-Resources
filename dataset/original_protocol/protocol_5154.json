    "Culturing of cellsNote: The following steps should be performed under a laminar flow hood. All instruments should be sterilized before. The adhesive tape should be taken out of its packing only under a laminar flow hood.Cut double-sided adhesive tape into 26-mm long pieces using a scalpel (Figure 4A). Note: Use one layer of adhesive tape with release liner as support. Then, add a second layer on top and cut this into size. This facilitates working with the adhesive tape, since it does not stick to the release liner.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170413/20170413191015_7778.jpgFigure 4. Preparation of culture dish with cover slides. A. A layer of double-sided adhesive tape (1) is glued on a smooth surface (e.g., an anodized aluminum plate). A second layer of double-sided adhesive tape is glued on top (2) and cut to length of a cover slide (left image). Afterwards, a rectangular of app. 21 x 5 mm is cut out in the center and removed (right image). B. The piece of double-sided adhesive tape is glued on a cover slide (4; left image). Mild pressing ensures tight contact and prevents leakage (right image). C. Photographic representation of a 6-well cell culture dish with cover slides with double sided sticky tape (arrowheads) in cell culture medium with phenol red. The double-sided sticky tapes have cut-outs fitting the cavity of the flow through chamber (arrows; compare Figure 1B).Cut out a 21 x 5 mm rectangular in the middle of each piece of adhesive tape using a scalpel and remove the inner rectangular (Figure 4A).Glue the adhesive tape on a 21 x 26 mm cover slide. Mildly press to ensure a tight contact without breaking the cover slide (Figure 4B).Sterilize the cover slides by dipping them in ethanol and wash them with sterile, distilled water. Place the cover slides in the 6-well-plate (Figure 4C).",
    "Detach cultured cells and plate them in the 6-well dish in regular cell culture medium (see Figure 4). The adhesive tape is not affected by the cell culture medium and remains sticky.Note: Let the cover slides dry or wash with cell culture medium before adding the cells, since distilled water is harmful to the cells.Incubate at 37 °C/5% CO2 at least until they are firmly attached. Cells can be cultured under this condition for days and transfected with the respective constructs of interest.Assembly of the cryo-stage on the microscopePrepare 10%, 20%, 30% and 50% (vol/vol) solutions of DMSO in imaging medium in 15-ml reaction tubes.Note: The inlet tube of the low temperature syringe pump can be inserted into the 15-ml reaction tubes through a hole in the lid (Figure 3A).Take the silver cooling head out of the casing of the cryo-stage.Connect the nitrogen pump, the liquid nitrogen reservoir using flexible silicon tube (i.d. 2 mm; o.d. 4 mm) and the electronic temperature control to the silver cooling head (see Figure 3B).Set the temperature of the silver block to 37 °C, using the control unit for the liquid nitrogen pump (Figure 3A-1).Attach a piece of flexible silicon tube (i.d. 1.5 mm; o.d. 3.5 mm) to the outlet of the low-pressure syringe pump. Note: The volume of the tube connected to the syringe pump should not exceed 200 μl. Otherwise, this would increase the amount of medium that needs to be exchanged during every step of the cryo-arrest.Fill the syringe and the tube with imaging medium without DMSO using the software of the automated syringe. Avoid air bubbles.Note: For the first filling, small amounts of medium have to be filled in the syringe and pressed through its outlet to remove air bubbles in the syringe and tubes before filling the syringe.",
    "Assemble the PVC-insert into the microscope table and center the objective below the opening for the flow through chamber (Figure 3B).Press 200-μl pipette tips through the in- and outlet of the flow-through chamber from the bottom. Remove the parts sticking out of the bottom with a scalpel. Also, cut of a few millimeters of the tapered end of the pipette tip with scissors (compare Figures 1A and 1B).Mounting of cells to the cryo-stage Note: Steps C1-C4 have to be performed quickly to protect the cells from drying out.Take the cover slide with adhesive tape and cells grown on it out of the 6-well plateRemove the release liner with fine forceps.Glue the cover slide to the flow-through chamber so that the cut-out in the middle fits to the cavity of the flow through chamber (Figure 1B).Fill the flow-through chamber with regular cell culture medium by pipetting through one of the pipet tips attached to the flow-through chamber. Fill the chamber and both pipet tips completely. Avoid air bubbles. Place the flow through chamber in the cavity of the PVC-insert (Figures 3B-5 and 3B-6).Connect the silicon tube from the syringe pump to one of the pipette tips of the flow through chamber (Figure 3B-4).Connect a piece of silicon tube (i.d. 1.5 mm; o.d. 3.5 mm; length ≤ 100 mm) to the other pipet tip and place an empty petri dish below the open end of the silicon tube (Figure 3B-9).Put a small drop of oil (e.g., immersion oil) on top of the aluminum chamber and mount the cooling head on it using the metal clamp (Figures 3B-2 and 3B-9)Connect the thermocouple into the drilling hole of the aluminum stage. Start the temperature measurement.",
    "The measured temperature should be above 36 °C, if the thermocouple is in reasonably good contact with the aluminum chamber.Reversible cryo-arrestFocus and image cells at 37 °C.Note: During this step it might be useful to supply the cells with fresh medium with a constant flow of 1 μl sec-1 using the automated syringe.For cryo-arrest: empty the syringe pump and load it with 10% DMSO solution, using the software control of the syringe pump.Set the temperature in the cryo-stage to 4 °C, using the control unit for the liquid nitrogen pump (Figure 3A-1).When the measured temperature in the aluminum chamber is stable, exchange the medium by applying a flow of 3 μl sec-1 for a total of 300 μl using the syringe pump.Empty the syringe and load it with 20% DMSO solution.Apply a flow of 3 μl sec-1 for a total of 300 μl using the syringe pump.Set temperature to -5 °C.Empty the syringe and load it with 30% DMSO solution.When the measured temperature in the aluminum chamber is stable, apply a flow of 3 μl sec-1 for a total of 300 μl using the syringe pump.Set temperature to -10 °C.Empty the syringe and load it with 50% DMSO solution.When the measured temperature in the aluminum chamber is stable, apply a flow of 3 μl sec-1 for a total of 600 μl using the syringe pump.Set temperature to -45 °C.After the temperature in the aluminum chamber is stable, cells can be imaged in the arrested stage. To go back to physiological temperature: Set temperature to -10 °C first.Empty the syringe and load it with 30% DMSO solution.When the measured temperature in the aluminum chamber is stable, apply a flow of 3 μl sec-1 for a total of 300 μl using the syringe pump.Set temperature to -5 °C.",
    "Empty the syringe and load it with 20% DMSO solution.When the measured temperature in the aluminum chamber is stable, apply a flow of 3 μl sec-1 for a total of 300 μl using the syringe pump.Set temperature to 4 °C.Empty the syringe and load it with 10% DMSO solution.Apply a flow of 3 μl sec-1 for a total of 300 μl using the syringe pump.Empty the syringe and load it with 0% DMSO solution.Apply a flow of 3 μl sec-1 for a total of 300 μl using the syringe pump.Set temperature to 37 °C.At 37 °C cells can be stimulated, e.g., with ligands for RTKs, light, etc.To arrest cells at a specific time after stimulation, start again with the cryo-arrest cycle. An example of EGFR localized by photoactivated localization microscopy in HeLa cells before and after stimulation with EGF is shown in Figure 5. More examples are shown in the original publication of the method (Masip et al., 2016).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170413/20170413192154_8049.jpgFigure 5. Photoactivated localization microscopy of EGFR in the same HeLa cell before and after stimulation. Shown are localization maps of a HeLa cell transfected with EGFR-mEos2 that was cryo-arrested before (left image) and 5 min after (right image) stimulation with 200 ng/ml EGF. Under reversible cryo-arrest EGFR molecules were localized by photo-activated localization microscopy with a precision of 21 ± 6 nm (mean ± SD). Scale bars = 5 μm"
