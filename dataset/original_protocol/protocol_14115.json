    "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (Institutional Review Board) of Saint Agnes Hospital (No. 2016-020).\n1. Preparations\nPreoperatively, give 5,000 units of heparin subcutaneously to prevent deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and give antibiotics per the hospital's surgical care improvement project (SCIP) policy, such as 2 g of cefazolin and 500 mg of metronidazole.\nPlace an epidural as discussed with the anesthesia team for optimal postoperative pain control and to promote enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS).\nIntraoperatively, perform a classic or pylorus-preserving PD in a standard fashion.7\n2. Transection of the Pancreatic Neck\nPrior to transection of the pancreatic neck, place four full-thickness, transpancreatic, 3-0 silk, stay sutures on the superior and inferior edges of the pancreas and then divide the pancreatic neck between these stay sutures. Place a Crile clamp on each of the four silk sutures.\nProceed to completion of the PD resection in standard fashion.\n3. Preparing the Jejunum and Pancreas for Anastomosis\nAfter removal of the specimen, dissect the posterior surface of the pancreas free from the retroperitoneum for several centimeters.\nBring the stapled end of the jejunum into position in preparation for anastomosis.\n4. Suture Placement:\nNOTE: The following sutures are placed in the following order to create the anastomosis (as shown in Figure 1).\nTwo 3-0 silk CW sutures (cw)",
    "For each of these, take a full-thickness bite through the pancreas a few centimeters from the cut surface, one at the superior border and one at the inferior border of the pancreas, each passing through a generous seromuscular bite of jejunum, as shown in Figure 1. The bites through the jejunum should be approximately 6 cm from each other (to allow for 2 cm of jejunum on either side of the jejunotomy, which is typically ~2 cm in length, but will vary with the thickness of the pancreatic neck).\nLeave these sutures untied, as they will later join the inferior border of the pancreas to the antimesenteric border of the proximal jejunum, and the superior border to the more distal antimesenteric border of the jejunum, wrapping the jejunum around the sides of the pancreatic remnant covering the corners of the anastomosis and giving the final appearance of a colonial wig (Figure 1).\nTwo 3-0 absorbable (e.g., VicrylTM) U-sutures (u)\nPlace these two stitches with a straight(ened) needle. For the first one, starting at the proximal aspect of the jejunotomy and traveling anterior to posterior, take a full-thickness bite through the anterior wall of the jejunotomy, then a full thickness bite through the pancreas, about 1 cm from the cut surface, and just a few mm from the superior border, and then take a full-thickness bite through the posterior wall of the proximal jejunotomy.",
    "Now the needle is at the bottom of the \"U,\" so turn 180 degrees and reverse the path, travelling posterior-to-anterior, taking a full-thickness bite through the posterior jejunum, then pancreas, then anterior wall of the jejunum (Figure 1A, 1B). These U-stitches are used to compress the small ducts (similar to the Blumgart anastomosis11) and to keep the pancreas securely invaginated in the jejunotomy (similar to the \"dunking PJ\" anastomosis8). Place the second U-suture in a similar fashion, but at the distal half of the jejunotomy and inferior to the pancreatic duct (Figure 1A, 1B).\nPlace a metallic probe (e.g., a Garrett dilator) in the pancreatic duct while taking the pancreatic bites close to the main pancreatic duct, to make sure that the suture does not go through the duct. Each of these should encompass most of the width of pancreatic parenchyma on either side of the pancreatic duct.\nTwo silk 3-0 stay sutures (s)\nAttach a French-eye needle to the previously placed stay stitches on the pancreatic remnant, and take a full-thickness bite, in-to-out, through the jejunum 1 cm away from the jejunotomy. The purpose of these stitches is to secure the invagination of the corners of the pancreatic remnant deep into the jejunotomy.\nAfter placing stitches #1-3, pull taut on the s and u stitches to invaginate the pancreatic remnant into the jejunotomy, then proceed with tying them in the following order: u then s then cw (Figure 1C, 1D). The jejunum should now look much like a Colonial wig fitted snugly around the sides of a Colonial Whig's head.\nSeveral interrupted 3-0 silk sutures provide a final, outer layer (o)",
    "Place these stitches very closely together in a vertical fashion between the anterior border of the pancreatic remnant and the cut edge of the jejunum to hermetically seal the redundant cuff of jejunum remaining after tying the u sutures to pancreatic capsule (Figure 1). Two of these stitches may be placed posteriorly as well, typically in a horizontal fashion, either now or earlier, e.g., after placing the sutures in steps 1.2 above.\n5. Placement of Omental Wrap\nWrap the PJ anastomosis with a harvested tongue of healthy omentum. Place two, 19-F, round, fluted (e.g., Blake) drains near, but not touching, the anastomosis (the omental flap serves in part to protect the PJ from the drains).\nPerform the remainder of the reconstruction, viz., the hepaticojejunostomy and the gastro- or duodenojejunostomy, as previously described.7\n6. Optional Adjuncts\nIn cases with high-risk features, such as soft pancreas parenchyma, consider decompressing the bilopancreatic limb, e.g., with the creation of a Braun enteroenterostomy between the afferent and efferent limbs of the gastro- or duodenojejunostomy or between the afferent and efferent limbs of the hepaticojejunostomy. The administration of somatostatin analogues is also recommended and is supported by prospective, randomized data.\n7. Postoperative Management\nPostoperatively, extubate the patient once stable from a hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint. Admit patients to the intensive care unit for overnight close monitoring, and follow local ERAS pathways.\nInitiate enteric feeds via an intraoperatively placed nasojejunal tube immediately postoperatively at a rate of 10 mL/h and advance to goal once there is evidence of return of small-bowel function. If starting somatostatin analogues pre- or intraoperatively, continue postoperatively.\nFor high-risk cases, use pasireotide at 900 µg twice daily for a week. For medium-risk cases and some low-risk cases, use octreotide at 100 µg three times daily until the day of discharge.",
