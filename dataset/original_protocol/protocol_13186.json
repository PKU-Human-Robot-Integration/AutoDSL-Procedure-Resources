    "All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). The study protocol was approved by and in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Fu-Jen Catholic University. See the Table of Materials for details about all materials and instruments used in this protocol.\n1. Preparing the mice\nSelect 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice with a weight of 21-23 g.\nHouse and maintain the mice under a 12 h light and dark cycle at a controlled temperature (21 ± 2 °C) with free access to food, standard mouse food pellets, and tap water.\n2. Anesthesia\nPut on a surgical mask and sterile gloves.\nPut the mice under anesthesia with 2% isoflurane mixed with oxygen at 1 L/min in the induction chamber.\nAssess the level of anesthesia by pedal reflex.\n\t​NOTE: Pedal reflex is a retraction of the hind paw in response to a firm toe pinch. The anesthetization is complete when the pedal reflex disappears.\nMove and place each mouse in prone position on a surgery platform with an electric blanket to maintain their body temperature once the anesthetization is complete. Stabilize the body temperature before surgery and monitor with rectal temperature probes. Apply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes to prevent dryness.\nTape the paws of the mice to the board.\nAttach a mask to the face of the mice to provide a constant supply of 1% isoflurane and 1 L/min oxygen\nAssess the level of anesthesia by pedal reflex regularly and adjust the anesthetic delivery accordingly during the surgery.\n3. Bilateral renal IR-AKI surgery",
    "Touch the back and find the lumbar spine of the mice manually. Move along the spine cephalically and look for costovertebral angles that are below both sides of the last rib of the mice.\nApply hair removal lotion to both sides of the costovertebral angle region for approximately 30 s and then remove the fur with saline.\nDisinfect the shaved skin with three rounds of betadine solution and 75% alcohol using cotton balls.\n\tNOTE: Maintaining a sterile field for surgery throughout the procedure is key. Apply a surgical drape and use sterile instruments.\nUse fine-tip forceps to gently lift the skin below the left costovertebral angle, and then use scissors to create a 1 cm oblique dorsolateral incision along the skin tension lines from the lumbar midline on the left flank. Transect the muscle wall of the left flank using scissors to visualize the left kidney.\nRepeat the aforementioned surgical procedures to visualize the right kidney. Remove the small amounts of blood produced during the procedure with sterile cotton swabs.\nPush and separate the left kidney carefully from the surrounding tissue with forceps. Identify the renal pedicle after the left kidney is exposed.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to injure the adrenal gland and the surrounding blood vessels.\nClamp over the left renal pedicle with a microvascular clip for 25 min. Confirm ischemia by a visible change in kidney color from pink to dark red.\nCover the clamped kidney with sterile saline wet cotton balls to avoid desiccation during left renal pedicle clamping.\nRepeat the aforementioned surgical procedures to clamp the right renal pedicle with a microvascular clip for 25 min.\nCover the clamped kidney with sterile saline wet cotton balls to avoid desiccation during right renal pedicle clamping.",
    "Monitor anesthesia depth and humidity of the sterile saline wet cotton balls periodically.\nOpen the left microvascular clip to start reperfusion of the left kidney. Confirm reperfusion by a visible color change of the left kidney from dark red to pink.\nOpen the right microvascular clip to start reperfusion of the right kidney.\nAfter the kidney color change is verified, return the kidney to the abdominal cavity.\nClose the abdominal cavity and skin with 6-0 absorbable suture materials.\nScrub to disinfect the wound with a betadine solution and 75% alcohol using cotton balls.\nObserve the animal carefully until it begins to move freely and feed.\n\tNOTE: Pay close attention to the animals until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nAdminister carprofen (5 mg/kg in 0.2 mL, administered subcutaneously) for 2-3 days to prevent postsurgical pain.\nSubscription Required.
