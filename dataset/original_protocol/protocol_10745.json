    "1. Organoid Units Preparation\nInstruments appropriate for mouse dissection (scissors and forceps) should be sterilized by autoclave.    \nHumanely euthanize the donor mouse according to local IACUC protocols. Ensure that the animal is dead before proceeding. \nMake a midline incision to gain access to the peritoneal cavity. Skin flaps can be reflected as needed to improve exposure.\nEviscerate the small bowel and divide it just distal to the ligament of Treitz. Separate the small bowel from its mesentery using sharp and gentle blunt dissection. Identify the ileocecal junction and divide the small bowel 5 mm proximal to this. \nUsing scissors, open the intestine lengthwise along the antimesenteric border in a Petri dish with 10 ml 4 °C, sterile Hanks' buffered saline (HBSS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) / 1X antibiotic-antifungal (Anti-Anti, Invitrogen) solution. Clear fecal matter from the opened intestine with gentle agitation then transfer opened intestine to a 15ml centrifuge tube with 10 ml of 4 °C, sterile HBSS / 1X anti-anti.\nWash the opened intestine three times in 10 ml of 4 ° C, sterile HBSS / 1X anti-anti in a test tube.   Each wash can be performed with mild shaking of the 15 ml tube for 30 sec.  After shaking, the intestinal tissue sinks to the bottom of the tube. Discard floating material, which is mesenchymal debris. Remove the washing solution carefully with a pipet.\nMince the washed intestine in a Petri dish with 10 ml of 4 °C, sterile HBSS / 1X anti-anti to less than 1 mm square pieces using a scissors. Gather the minced material up with an automatic pipet and place it into a test tube.    \nCentrifuge the tube at 500 rpm for 8 min. Discard the supernatant, which contains fat and mesenchyme.",
    "Digest the minced, washed material with 10 ml of sterile HBSS / 1X anti-anti plus 0.125 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen) and 800 units/ml collagenase type 1 (Worthington, Lakewood NJ). To prepare 40 ml of the digestion solution, weigh out 5 mg of dispase, 142 mg of collagenase, and add sterile HBSS up to a volume of 40 ml. Prepare this solution freshly each time organoid units are prepared, and keep at 4° C until ready to use. Add the digestion solution directly to the pellet from step 1.8.    \nIncubate the test tube containing the minced, washed material with the digestion solution at 37 °C for 20 min.\nRetrieve the test tube and further disrupt the digested tissue by trituration with a 10 ml pipet. Repeat between 20 to 50 times until a uniform appearance is obtained. \nCentrifuge the test tube for 5 min at 800 rpm. Discard the supernatant, which contains single cells. \nStop the digestion reaction with 10 ml of 4 °C, sterile Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) plus 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS, Invitrogen). Resuspend the pellet and shake the tube.    \nCentrifuge the test tube for 5 min at 800 rpm. Remove the supernatant carefully with an automatic pipet until the last few drops. Use a disposable plastic pipet for the last few drops to avoid resuspending the pellet. \n2. Loading of Polyglycolic Acid Scaffold\nForm 2-mm long, 5-mm outer diameter cylindrical scaffolds from nonwoven polyglycolic acid (2-mm sheet thickness, 60 mg cm-3 bulk density; porosity > 95%, Concordia Fibers, Coventry RI) as described in Ref. 4.    \nTrim the distal 2 mm of a disposable 1,000 microliter pipet tip with scissors prepared with 70% ethanol in distilled water.",
    "Place the scaffold into a 4-well culture plate. Load the organoid units onto the scaffold with the 1,000 microliter pipet, first into the lumen and then onto the outer surface. Use a forceps to ensure coating of the lumen. Do not disrupt or break open the cylindrical shape of the polymer. \n3. Implantation into Host Mouse\nUse a syngeneic host mouse on the same background as the donor if available. Otherwise, employ an immunocompromised nonobese diabetic / severe combined immunodeficient or NOD / SCID animal (Jackson Laboratories, Sacramento CA).\nInduce general anesthesia with isoflurane. Shave, prep and drape the mouse's abdomen.    \nMake a 5 mm midline incision to gain entrance to the peritoneal cavity. Identify and carefully eviscerate the greater omentum. Place the loaded polymer onto the omentum and wrap it with the tissue. Do not tear the omentum.\nSecure the polymer to the omentum with a 5-0 monocryl suture. Gently replace the omentum with the wrapped polymer into its anatomic position.\nClose the abdominal incision in layers using 4-0 vicryl sutures. Run the muscle closure and take care not to injure the abdominal viscera below the incision. Use interrupted sutures for the skin.\nAdminister postoperative analgesia with 2 mg/kg ketoprofen (Ketofen, Fort Dodge Animal Health) in sterile water as a subcutaneous wheal adjacent to the incision.  Animals should be evaluated daily and if the animal is demonstrating signs of pain or distress, an additional dose of ketoprofen may be administered on post operative day 2.  By the third postoperative day, the animal should be fully recovered without evidence of pain or distress.  If pain or distress continues on post operative day 3, this is considered abnormal and should be addressed in accordance with the IACUC and animal care facility protocols.",
    "Allow the mouse to recuperate and the tissue-engineered intestine to grow for four weeks. Give the animal ad libitum access to rodent chow (Lab Diet 5001, PMI Nutrition, St. Louis MO) and water with Septra 200 mg / 40 mg per 5 ml (Hi-Tech Pharmacal, Amityville NY) at 1:100 dilution. \n4. Harvest\nHumanely euthanize the host animal four weeks after implantation.\nReopen the original incision and reflect the skin cephalad to facilitate access to the peritoneal cavity.\nOpen the muscle layer and identify the tissue-engineered construct as a globe of tissue.\nTake down adhesions to the construct from intraabdominal viscera using sharp dissection.\nFix the construct in formalin for later paraffin mounting, or use the tissue fresh for biochemical assays such as real-time PCR or protein isolation.    \nSubscription Required.
