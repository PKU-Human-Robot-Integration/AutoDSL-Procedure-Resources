    "1. Setting up crystallization assays in ChipX\nNOTE: The ChipX microfluidic device can be obtained from the authors. A description of the chip is given in Figure 1. Solutions containing the crystallant (or crystallizing agent) used to trigger crystallization may be of commercial origin or prepared by the experimenter.\nLoading the biomolecule sample\n\t​NOTE: The sample volume actually required to perform an individual counter-diffusion assay in the straight section of each channel of ChipX is 300 nL. However for convenience we suggest to load 5 µL to completely fill the eight channels taking into account the variable length of their curved section and inlet dead volumes.\n\t\nPipet 5 µL of enzyme solutions using standard 10 µL pipet and tip.\nIntroduce the tip vertically in the sample inlet and inject the solution until the eight channels are filled up to their opposite end (entry of the crystallant reservoir).\nInject 1 µL of paraffin oil in the sample inlet in order to disconnect the channels from each other.\nRecover the extra solution in the crystallant reservoir at the extremity of each channel using a standard 10 µL pipet.\nSeal the sample inlet with a 1 cm x 1 cm piece of tape.\nLoading the crystallization solutions\n\t\nPipet 5 µL of crystallization solution using standard 10 µL pipet and tip. The reservoir volume is 10 µL, but loading only half of it avoids overflow when sealing with tape and facilitates further addition of ligand for soaking experiments. If initial crystallization conditions were obtained by vapor diffusion, increase the crystallant concentration by a factor of 1.5 - 2. Solutions can be different in every reservoir (in the presented case, 1 M diammonium hydrogen phosphate, 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 was used throughout).",
    "Orient the pipet tip towards the entry of the channel in the funnel shaped part of the reservoir to avoid the formation of an air bubble upon solution deposition. It would prevent the contact between the two solutions and crystallant diffusion into the channel.\nInject the crystallant solution into the reservoir.\nSeal the reservoirs with a 2.5 cm x 1 cm piece of tape.\nIncubate the chip at 20 °C (temperature can be adjusted depending on the target, typically between 4 and 37 °C 4).\n2. Protein labeling with carboxyrhodamine for fluorescence detection\nNOTE: This step is optional. It must be performed prior to sample loading to facilitate the detection of crystals in the chip using fluorescence. The detailed method of trace fluorescent labeling was described by Pusey and coworkers7. All steps are carried out at room temperature.\nDissolve 5 mg of carboxyrhodamine ester powder in 1 mL anhydrous dimethyl-formamide, split the solution in 0.6 µL aliquots to be stored at -20 °C.\nPrepare a 1 M Na-borate pH 8.75 stock solution.\nDilute the stock to prepare the reaction buffer at 0.05 M Na-borate pH 8.75.\nRinse a desalting column (7 kDa MWCO, 0.5 mL) with 800 µL of reaction buffer.\nCentrifuge the column for 1 min at 1400 x g, remove the filtrate.\nRepeat this operation twice (steps 2.4-2.5) to wash the column.\nDeposit 80 µL of protein in its storage buffer on the column (the protein can be diluted down to 1 mg/mL to increase the volume if needed).\nCentrifuge the column for 1 min at 1400 x g. This step is intended to transfer the protein from its storage buffer to the reaction buffer.\nRecover the flow-through (containing the protein in the reaction buffer) and mix it with 0.6 µL of carboxyrhodamine solution.",
    "Incubate 5 min at room temperature.\nMeanwhile, rinse the column 3 x with the storage buffer, centrifuge the column for 1 min at 1400 x g and discard the filtrate.\nDeposit the reaction solution on the column.\nCentrifuge the column for 1 min at 1400 x g and recover the flow-through (i.e., solution of labeled protein in its storage buffer).\nSupplement the stock protein solution with 0.1-1 % (w/w) of labeled protein.\nSetup the ChipX crystallization assays as described in section 1.\nCheck for the presence of protein crystals in the assays by exciting the fluorescent probe with a 520 nm wavelength light source.\n3. Crystal observation\nNOTE: The ChipX device may be handled without special care, even with crystals inside, except if the temperature needs to be controlled.\nUse any stereomicroscope to check the outcome of crystallization assays in ChipX. Its footprint has the standard dimensions of microscope slides and is compatible with any system and slide holder.\nCheck the content of microfluidic channels starting from the reservoir where the crystallant concentration is the highest to the sample inlet where the crystallant concentration is the lowest. The ChipX material is transparent to visible light, compatible with the use of polarizers, as well as with UV illumination for protein crystal identification by intrinsic tryptophane fluorescence8.\nRecord crystal positions using the labels embossed along the channels or mark crystal locations with a permanent marker by drawing color dots next to them on the chip surface.\n4. Crystal soaking with ligands\nNOTE: This procedure is optional. It is used to introduce ligands, enzyme substrates or heavy atoms into the crystals and should be carried out at least 24-48 h before X-ray analysis to allow the compound diffusion along the channels and into the crystals.\nGently remove the sealing tape from the reservoirs.",
    "Add up to 5 µL of ligand solution in one or several reservoirs using a 10 µL micropipet (in the example, 3 µL of 10 mM cytidine-5'-[(α,β)-methyleno] triphosphate (CMPcPP) solution was added to achieve a final concentration of 3.75 mM). CMPcPP is a non-hydrolizable analog of CTP, a natural substrate of the enzyme.\nSeal the reservoirs with a 2.5 cm x 1 cm piece of tape.\nIncubate the chip under controlled temperature for 24-48 h to allow ligand diffusion along the channels of the chip.\n5. Crystal analysis by serial crystallography\nNOTE: This part of the protocol needs to be adapted depending on the beamline setup and the diffraction properties of the crystals. Only general indications are given for the crystallographic analysis based on experiments performed at X06DA beamline (SLS, Villigen, Switzerland).\nChipX mounting on the beamline goniometer\n\t​NOTE: The file for 3D printing the ChipX holder is provided in ref4.\n\t\nTurn off the cryo-jet of the beamline. The analysis here is carried out at room temperature.\nMount the ChipX on a dedicated holder with the channel containing the crystals to be analyzed positioned at the center of the holder. The ChipX holder4 does not require any screw or additional part, as it was designed to provide a perfect fit for ChipX.\nAttach the holder to the goniometer.\nData collection\n\t\nOrient the thickest layer (top layer, Figure 1) of ChipX (in this orientation labels along the channels are directly readable using the centering camera of the beamline), towards the direct beam and the thinnest face behind the crystal to minimize the attenuation of the diffracted signal as described in ref3.\nTo avoid collision of ChipX with the surrounding material (beamstop, collimator), restrict goniometer movements in the range ±30° (0° corresponding to the channels being perpendicular to the X-ray beam).",
    "Find crystals position with the help of the labels embossed along the channels.\nSelect a crystal position.\nCenter the crystal either by standard low dose grid/raster screening or 1-click procedure (the video shows an example of grid screening).\nCollect diffraction data within the range -30° / +30°.\nRestart the procedure at steps 5.2.4-5.2.6 on another crystal in the same channel after translation of the chip.\nManually realign another ChipX channel at the center of the holder and carry on data collection on crystals present in this channel.\nUse standard crystallographic packages and procedures to process and merge the data, then to solve and refine the structure."
