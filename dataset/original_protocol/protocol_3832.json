    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nComplementation at the cellular level by lyso-PS\nTiming: 3 h\nTo complement PS-deficient plants at the subcellular level, we studied the subcellular localization of a PS biosensor in WT and pss1-3-/- seedlings adding back external lyso-PS. Briefly, WT and pss1-3-/- mutant seedlings expressing the PS biosensor (pUBQ10::mCITRINE-2xPHEVCT2) are treated in ½ MS liquid media supplemented or not with lyso-PS (or lyso-PA as control) and then images are acquired using a confocal microscope.\nTreat seedlings with lyso-PS\nPrepare 12-wells plates containing 2 mL of ½ MS liquid media supplemented or not with lyso-PS at 54 μM (as prepared in step 5).\nPlace about 10–15 of 8 to 12-day-old seedlings of each genotype in wells supplemented with or without lyso-PS. Make sure that the seedlings are drowned in the media.\nTransfer the plate in a growth chamber in continuous light conditions 150 μE.m−2.s−1 at 21°C for an hour.\nPrepare microscope\nUse an inverted Zeiss microscope equipped with a spinning disk module and a ProEM+ 1024B camera using a 63× Plan- Apochromat objective\nTurn on the 515 nm laser for mCITRINE excitation (60 mW)\nSet fluorescence emission filter to 578/105 nm, using BrightLine® single-band bandpass filter (Semrock, http://www.semrock.com/[href=http://www.semrock.com/]).\nClean the objective before usage applying 70% ethanol using a lens paper.\nMount seedlings on microscope slides\nWhen using 60 millimeters wide cover slips, add about 75 μL of corresponding liquid ½ MS with or without lyso-PS in the middle of the slide with a plastic Pasteur pipette. If 40 millimeters cover slips are used, add about 50 μL instead (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/749-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(A–D) Images of microscope slides with ½ MS (with or without lyso-PS) (A), ½ MS (with or without lyso-PS) and seedlings (B), ½ MS (with or without lyso-PS) and decapitated seedlings (C) and ½ MS (with or without lyso-PS), decapitated plants and cover slip.\n(E) Confocal images of 8–12 days old seedling expressing PS biosensor (UBQ10::mCITRINE-2xPHEVCT2) in WT (upper panels) and in pss1-3-/- (lower panels) under mock condition (left panels) and under lyso-PS treatment for an hour (right panels). Asterix indicates cell which shows larger width than length, white arrow indicates plasma membrane and red arrow indicates endosomes. Scale bars 5 μm.\nPlace about 5 seedlings in the drop on the microscope slide and orient the root perpendicular to the main axis of the slide (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nRemove the shoot with a scalpel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPlace the cover slip gently on the sample to avoid crushing the root (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: After placing the coverslip on the samples, if the entire coverslip is not fully covered with liquid ½ MS, add-back liquid ½ MS in the interstice between the slide and the coverslip using a plastic Pasteur pipette. If too much water has been added, the cover slip might move around. In that case, place a cleaning tissue in the interstice between the slide and the coverslip to absorb excessive water. It is also possible to tape the slide and the coverslip together with surgical tape to avoid movement of the coverslip (Bayle et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nCritical: Prior to placing the plants on the slide, make sure that the roots have been dipped in the in the corresponding liquid ½ MS to avoid the seedlings from drying.",
    "Optional: Removing the shoot is optional as for certain experiments, it might stress the plants. It is thus possible to mount the entire seedlings, without removing the shoot, by simply placing the shoot, starting from the base of the hypocotyl, outside of the slide/coverslip sandwich (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). To avoid crushing the samples, it is also possible to make spacers between the slide and the coverslip. To do that, put two to three layers of surgical tape around the slide, on both sides of the samples. Make both spacers of equal thickness on both side of the samples to ensure that the slide and the coverslip remains parallel (Bayle et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nImaging of PS biosensor\nPour one drop of immersion oil on the objective\nPlace the slide on the microscope stage.\nUsing the brightfield to find the root tip.\nAdjust the x-y-z position to observe the epidermis in the basal meristem.\nAcquire images with settings allowing to obtain the best signal/noise ratio and to avoid signal saturation. This can be monitored by observing the diagram of the image dynamic or using the range indicator (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: To find the epidermis in the basal meristem, make sure that the focus is adjusted on cells which correspond to the outer layer of the root and with a width larger than the length as indicated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E with the asterix. The epidermis can easily be distinguished from the lateral root cap, because epidermal cells in the meristem are not fully elongated and differentiated (they have small vacuoles), while cells in the lateral root cap are elongated and have a big central vacuole.",
    "Critical: Make sure that the imaged root has not been damaged during the slide mounting process by visualizing rectangle cells with a nearly straight plasma membrane as in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E.\nOptional: We image the meristematic zone since meristematic cells have small vacuoles and an expanded cytosol, making the comparison between soluble and membrane-localized mCITRINE-2xPHEVCT2 easier. However, the difference of localization of this PS sensor between the wild-type and pss1 mutant can be easily distinguished in all the cell types that we have looked at, including in the root meristem, differentiated cells of the root and shoot tissues. Thus, it is possible to analyze the localization of the PS sensor in a wide range of cell types, not only root meristem epidermis, to check whether the lyso-PS treatment was efficient.\nImage analysis\nEvaluating the subcellular localization of the PS biosensor by eyes is sufficient. No quantification is needed (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). Evaluate the phenotype based on the criteria listed below:\nThe PS biosensor is localized at the plasma membrane and endosomes in the WT which looks like thin lines around the cell and dots inside the cells, respectively.\nThe PS biosensor is localized in the cytosol in pss1-3-/- mutant which looks like a spread and smooth signal inside the cell with black round holes corresponding to the nucleus and vacuoles.\nThe PS biosensor is localized at the plasma membrane and endosomes in pss1-3-/- treated with lyso-PS mimicking the localization in the WT\nComplementation at the macroscopic level by lyso-PS\nTiming: 21 days",
    "In order to observe complementation of pss1-3-/- at the macroscopic level using lyso-PS, we used root growth and the size of the rosette as a readout. Briefly, WT and pss1-3-/- mutant seedlings are first grown for 8–12 days in ½ MS agar plates. They are then dipped in ½ MS liquid media supplemented or not with lyso-PS and transferred to ½ MS agar media supplemented or not with lyso-PS for 6 days. Finally, seedlings are transferred in soil for 8 days before image acquisition for quantification.\nTransfer seedlings to ½ MS agar plates\nIn a sterile hood, transfer 6 seedlings of 8–12 days old alternating sides on plate supplemented or not with lyso-PS using sterile tweezers.

Scale bars 1 cm.\nSeal the plates with micropore surgical tape.\nPlace the plates vertically in a growth chamber in continuous light conditions 150 μE.m−2.s−1 at 21°C for 6 days.\nNote: To sterilize the tweezers, dip them in ethanol 70% and flame dry them by quickly passing the ethanol-soaked tweezers into the flame (using a Bunsen burner or an alcohol burner). Make sure that the tweezers are cooled down before starting to transfer the plants in order to avoid burning and stressing the tissue.",
    "Optional: Before transfer, dip the plants in the corresponding liquid media for 5 s. While the plants are growing, the plates can be scanned using EPSON scanner perfection V300 PHOTO at 800 dpi to measure the root growth rate as described in Platre et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nTransfer the seedlings in soil\nUsing tweezers, transfer two seedlings per pot.\nUse a tag indicating the genotype and the media in which the seedlings have been growing in.\nGrow the plants in a growth chamber in long day (18 h light, 6 h dark) light conditions 150 μE.m−2.s−1 at 21°C for 8 days.\nCritical: Make sure that the plants are not too close from each other when transplanting them, and in addition, ensure that plants are away from the pot edges to allow proper quantification.\nNote: In our condition, 8-day-old plants are enough to observe significantly complemented rosette phenotype in pss1-3-/- by eyes. To avoid the effect of overlapping rosette in WT plants, proper quantification is required. However, any time before 8 days can be used.\nImage acquisition of the rosette\nUsing a camera and a macro objective, in our case (CANON EOS 450D with a SIGMA DC 18–50 mm 1:2.8 EX MACRO lens) to take pictures (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nUse setting to optimize the color between the rosette and the background, automatic settings should be sufficient.\nIn one of the picture place a ruler to be able to update the image scale in centimeters (cm) for quantification\nCritical: It is imperative to use a camera holder to make sure the distance between the objective and the plants is staying the same between the different images.\nImage quantification (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])",
