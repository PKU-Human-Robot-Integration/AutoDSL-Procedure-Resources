    "This study was conducted following the recommendations of the Experimental Animal Center of Minzu University (No. ECMUC2019008AA). The protocol was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethical Committee of Minzu University. MT was collected from Kunming, Yunnan province.\n1. Preparation for the study\nExtract MT with hot water (100 °C; MT/water = 1/10, w/v) for 30 min and collect the MT extraction residue as the test material.\nMaintain the LLC mouse lung cancer cell line in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nKeep the C57BL/6J mice, aged 6-8 weeks and weighing 19 ± 2 g, in an environmentally controlled room with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle and with unlimited access to food and water. Disinfect them regularly.\n2. Preliminary screening of strains\nInoculate three strains of fungi into potato dextrose agar (PDA) solid medium using sterile techniques and culture them in the dark at 28 °C. After the dishes are fully covered with fungi, store them at 4 °C.\nInoculate the strains preserved in the PDA solid medium in the seed solution of the first-stage shake flask and culture them at 28 °C, with shaking at 120 rpm for 4-5 days. Inoculate the first-stage fungi liquid into the shake flask containing the secondary fungi liquid at a volume ratio of 1:20 in a constant temperature shaker for 4-5 days.",
    "Dilute the MT with water to 100 mg/L (MT/water) and add the solution to agar to form a solid medium. Inoculate 1 mL of the secondary fungal liquid of each of the three strains into the solid culture containing only MT, and then divide into G. lucidum-MT, I. obliquus-MT, and O. sinensis-MT culture systems. Place these culture systems at 28 °C without shaking in the dark.\nAfter some time, observe the growth of the strains in the above three culture systems, and select the strains that can only grow with MT for further screening.\n3. Strain selection rescreening\nNOTE: After preliminary screening, only G. lucidum and O. sinensis could grow normally on solid medium containing MT. To further select the system with good antitumor effect, the antitumor efficacy was tested in a transplanted tumor mouse model.\nInoculate G. lucidum and O. sinensis into liquid medium containing only MT-MT with G. lucidum co-fermentation (MGF) and MT with O. sinensis co-fermentation (MOF), and ferment for 10 days at 28 °C with shaking at 180 rpm.\nAfter fermentation, filter the mycelium through gauze and dry it. Extract with 80% ethanol 3 x 12 h.\nCheck the antitumor activity of the fermented and unfermented MT in LLC tumor cell-bearing C57BL/6J mice.\n\t\nSubcutaneously inject LLC cells (1.0 × 106 cells in 0.2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) per mouse) into the right flank of male C57BL/6J mice (except in the control group).",
    "To confirm successful establishment of the model, touch the tumor nodules and verify they are ~5 mm in size. Randomly group the tumor-bearing mice (n = 10 per group) into the model group, MGF group, MOF group, MT group, and cisplatin group (positive control). Administer saline to the control group (no tumor cells) and the model group. Sacrifice the mice after 14 days of treatment and collect the tumor tissue.\n4. Chemical composition analysis of fermentation products\nNOTE: After verifying the efficacy of fermentation, G. lucidum was selected as the fermentation strain in this study. We performed metabolomics analysis of MGF by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)11.\nExtract 10 mg of MT, G. lucidum, and MT with G. lucidum co-fermentation (MGF) with 500 µL of methanol:H2O (7:3), shake at 4 °C for 1 min, sonicate for 30 min, and centrifuge for 20 min at 1,200 × g. Collect the supernatants, filter them through a 0.22 µm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and inject into the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry setup (LC-MS/MS).\n\t​NOTE: Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-separated metabolites and a quality control (QC) sample library was constructed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (see Table of Materials).\nUse the following UPLC conditions: a C18 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm; 8 µm), mobile phase A-0.1% (v/v) formic acid in ultrapure water, mobile phase B-acetonitrile. Set the gradient elution profile to be 0 min 5% B; 2 min 5% B; 14 min 98% B; 17 min 98% B; 17.1 min 5% B; 20 min 5% at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.",
    "Detect and identify the metabolites by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Set the column temperature to 40 °C, automatic injector temperature to 4 °C, and injection volume to 2 µL. Maintain the following MS conditions: the voltage of the electrospray ion source: +5,500/-4,500 V; the pressure of the curtain gas, ion source 1, and ion source 2: 35, 60, and 60 psi, respectively; the temperature of the ion source: 600 °C; the depolymerization potential: ± 100 V.\nPrepare the quality control samples (QCs) by mixing equal volumes of MT, GL, and MGF extracts, and name the three replicates QC 1-3, respectively. Process and detect quality control and analysis samples by following the same steps. Insert a QC sample for every three samples to investigate the repeatability of detection and analysis.\n5. Extraction and isolation of fermentation products\nDissolve the fermentation extract obtained from the fermentation broth in distilled water and stir thoroughly.\n\tNOTE: Here, 2 kg of fermentation extract was obtained from 40 L of fermentation broth.\nFrom section 4, elute 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 95% ethanol fractions using a macroporous adsorption resin column and collect the fractions.\n\tNOTE: Here, 10.72 g of the 95% ethanol fraction, 34.72 g of the 70% ethanol fraction, 61.57 g of the 50% ethanol fraction, and 79.7 g of the 30% ethanol fraction were obtained.\nBased on the polarity of the fractions, elute the 70% ethanol fraction using silica gel column chromatography with ethyl acetate:methanol elution and collect the fractions.\n\tNOTE: Here, Fr. 1-Fr. 7 were collected.\nPerform Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography to further purify the fractions (here, Fr. 3 and Fr. 4) followed by semi-preparative liquid phase separation after purification using 1.0 g of each fraction.",
    "NOTE: By using semi-preparative liquid chromatography and silica gel column chromatography, we isolated and purified the 95% ethanol fraction.\nPerform microspectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and compare the structure of the compound(s) with structures from databases for 600M and 700M and determine the planar structure of the compound(s).\n\tNOTE: Here, a hybrid mass spectrometer was used to determine the molecular weight of the mixture. We identified the structure of one compound (see Supplemental Figure S1).\n6. Statistical analyses\nRepeat all the fermentation experiments six times. Assess statistical significance using Student's t-test. Express all data as the mean ± SD, repeat all experiments in triplicate, and set p < 0.05 for statistical significance (*0.01 ≤ p ≤ 0.05, **0.001 ≤ p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001).\nUse SCIEX OS software to identify metabolites mainly based on mass error, retention time, isotope match, MS/MS library purity score, and computational molecular formula. Use the following library setting parameters: mass error < 5 ppm, isotope ratio difference < 20, and library score > 50.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
