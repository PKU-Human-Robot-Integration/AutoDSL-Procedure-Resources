    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nDissociation and Culture of Primary GBM Tissue\nTiming: ~1 h\nThis step allows you to dissociate patient-derived tumor specimens into a single cell population.\nMechanical dissociation of tumor\nAdd 100–200 μL of Liberase (stock solution at 2.5 mg/mL in sterile water) to 15 mL of PBS. Warm solution to 37°C to ensure optimal enzymatic activity. Tumor specimens larger than 15 mm3 may require a greater amount of Liberase and/or PBS for effective dissociation.\nWarm an aliquot of 0.8% ammonium chloride solution and NeuroCult Complete (NCC) media to 37°C. The amount of these solutions are dependent on size of the tumor specimen. A 15 mm3 tumor specimen may require 4–12 mL of ammonium chloride solution and 7–10 mL of NCC media, largely dependent on red blood cell (RBC) abundance and number of isolated tumor cells, respectively.\nPlace the patient brain tumor specimen in a 100 mm cell culture dish. Gently pipette 5 - 10 mL of PBS onto the sample to wash away red blood cells (RBCs) and other fluids. Discard fluids by pipetting without disturbing the specimen.\nUsing surgical scissors and forceps, mechanically dissociate the tumor sample into a homogenous consistency. The majority of dissociated pieces should be <2 mm3.\nAliquot and snap freeze a small amount of tumor sample (~5%–10% of specimen or at least 3 mm3) at −80°C for downstream genomic, transcriptomic, and/or proteomic analyses.\nEnzymatic dissociation of tumor tissue\nTransfer the mechanically-dissociated tumor specimen into 15 mL pre-warmed PBS with Liberase (previously prepared). Incubate at 37°C for 15 min in an incubator-shaker (30 rpm). The amount of PBS with Liberase should be adjusted according to tumor size, ensuring that the amount of dissociation solution is at least double the tumor specimen volume.",
    "After incubation, filter the tissue lysate through a 70 μm cell strainer into a new tube to separate and discard undigested tissue.\nCentrifuge filtrate at 300 × g for 5 min. Remove supernatant carefully and resuspend pellet in 1 mL of PBS.\nRBC lysis\nAdd 4 - 12 mL of ammonium chloride solution and incubate for 5 min. This range is proportional to pellet size and infiltration of RBCs.\nAfter incubation, add an equivalent amount of PBS. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Decant supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 mL of pre-warmed NCC media.\nPlating cells\nIn a separate tube, add 10 μL of the cell suspension to 10 μL of Trypan Blue. Mix well and count cells using a hemocytometer, as per manufacturer’s instructions.\nTransfer the cell suspension to either a 100 mm or a 60 mm ultra-low-binding tissue culture dish. If the total number of cells is < 1 million, plate cells in a 60 mm CELLSTAR® Cell-Repellent tissue culture dish with 3 mL of total NCC media. If the total number of cells exceeds 1 million, plate up to 2.5 million cells in a 100 mm CELLSTAR® Cell-Repellent tissue culture dish with 7–10 mL of total NCC media. Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for at least 48 h.\nWhen media changes color (red to orange) or 72 h have passed after plating cells, add 2 - 4 mL of NCC media to the cell culture dish. Change media completely when media color turns slightly yellow, as per instructions below.\nPropagation and Dissociation of GSC Cultures\nTiming: continuous\nThis step allows you to culture and dissociate patient-derived tumorspheres",
    "Monitor the number of tumorspheres and their size over time for each GSC culture. If the number of tumorspheres and their size increases over time, the GSC culture may be cultured as spheres in low-binding cell culture dishes (see step 6). However, if the number of tumorspheres decreases over time or stays constant, the GSC culture may be grown on poly-L-ornithine and laminin coated tissue culture-treated dishes (see step 8).\nMedia replacement of tumorspheres\nBefore you start, warm fresh NCC media to 37°C.\nPipette cell culture to a sterile tube.\nCollect any remaining cells by rinsing the culture dish with 5–10 mL of PBS, and add it to the same tube.\nCentrifuge for 300 × g for 5 min and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of warm NCC media.\nGently add the cell solution to the cell culture dish with additional media, as per manufacturer’s recommended volumes. Cell culture dishes can be reused for up to 2 weeks.\nDissociation of tumorspheres\nTransfer cell culture to a sterile tube.\nCollect any remaining cells by rinsing the culture dish with 5–10 mL of PBS, and add it to the same tube.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 300 × g for 5 min and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of PBS.\nAdd 3–5 μL of Liberase (stock solution at 2.5 μg/μL in sterile water) and 5–10 μL DNase I (stock solution at 2000 U/mL in PBS) to the cell suspension. Incubate in a 37°C water bath for 5 min or less.\nCritical: If tumorspheres are still visible after incubation, incubate the cell solution for an additional 2–5 min. Do not exceed 15 min of total incubation time to avoid significant cell death.\nAfter incubation, pipette up and down gently using a micropipette to aid complete cell dissociation.",
    "Add 5–10 mL of PBS to the cell suspension. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 500–1,000 μL of PBS for use in assays or in 1 mL of NCC media for replating.\nFor use in assays, filter the cell suspension into a 12 × 75 mm tubes with 35 μm cell strainer cap.\nDetermine cell number and viability using Trypan blue solution. Adjust cell count as required for specific assays or replating. For replating, cell density should be between 25%–50% as per dish size and depends on cell doubling time, cell size, and media consumption. Dissociated tumorspheres can be plated on tissue culture-treated or cell-repellent dishes, and should not be plated on poly-L-ornithine and laminin coated dishes (see step 8).\nPlating tumorspheres on coated dishes\nAdd poly-L-ornithine and sterile water in a 1:3 ratio to the dish, as required to completely coat the surface. Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nRemove poly-L-ornithine solution and wash the culture dish with 2–5 mL of sterile water.\nAdd PBS with 4 μg/mL laminin to the dish, as required to completely coat the surface. Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for up to 12 h. A longer laminin coating incubation period may improve cell adherence.\nTumorsphere or dissociated adherent cells can be plated on coated dishes. Tumorspheres should not be dissociated prior to plating on coated dishes.\nResuspend desired cell solution in warm NCC media. This media volume should equal 5%–10% of the cell culture dish’s working volume.\nRemove laminin solution and wash the culture dish with sterile PBS immediately before plating cells. Do not allow the coated dish to dry.",
    "Add the cell solution to the coated dish in a drop-wise manner and place gently into an incubator. Incubate at 37°C for 5 min to 1 h.\nCritical: After plating tumorspheres and incubating cells for 5 min at 37°C and 5% CO2, determine if the tumorspheres have become adherent by gently rocking the plate and observing movement of tumorspheres using a microscope. If tumorspheres have not adhered, incubate cells for up to 4 h 37°C and 5% CO2. Increasing the amount of laminin while coating dishes may increase adherence of tumorspheres.\nIf the tumorspheres are visibly adherent, top up media with an appropriate volume as per culture dish size.\nSubsequent media top up and replacement can be performed as required, taking care not to disturb the adherent cells.\nAt 70%–80% confluency, cells can be dissociated by removing NCC media and adding an amount of TrypLE that is 5% of the total media volume. Incubate at 37°C for 5 min.\nTransfer dissociated cells to a sterile tube. Collect any remaining cells by rinsing the culture dish with 5–10 mL of PBS, and add it to the same tube. Follow appropriate instructions above for replating on coated or low-binding dishes, or for use in assays.\nIntracranial Injection of GSCs into Mice\nTiming: 2+ h\nThis step allows you to intracranially-inject patient-derived tumor cells into mice.\nPreparation of GSCs\nAdherent GSCs should be grown as tumorsphere for 72–96 h prior to xenograft experiments (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/282-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. GSCs Grown in Adherent or Spherical Conditions\nMicroscopic images of GSCs grown in adherent (MBT06) or spherical (BT241) conditions. Scale bar represents 200 μm.\nDissociate tumorspheres and prepare a single cell solution of GSCs as detailed above. Resuspend GSCs in 1–2 mL of PBS. Count cells using Trypan Blue as described above.",
    "The number of cells to be injected should be resuspended in PBS but the volumes should not exceed 10 μL per mouse. The number of injected cells can range from 50,000 to 1,000,000 cells, depending on cell line tumorigenicity and engraftment ability.\nCell concentrations are adjusted as desired in a volume of PBS between 5 and 10 μL. Store tubes on ice.\nPreparation of mice for injection\nAll in vivo procedures are performed according to Animal Research Ethics Board approved protocols. All injection procedures are performed aseptically in a BSL2 hood (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), with all equipment sterilized before placing it inside the hood.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/282-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Surgical Area Setup\nSurgery is performed in a BSL2 hood with adequate airflow and sterilization of all equipment before entering the surgical area.\nSet up the anesthetic machine as required. Place one mouse at a time in the induction chamber (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) until the mouse in unresponsive (determined by no response by lightly pinching the toes with tweezers). Mice are anesthetized using Isoflurane, induced at 5% and maintained at 2.5% for the surgical procedure (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/282-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Induction Chamber Setup\nThe induction chamber administers vaporized isoflurane to the mouse.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/282-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Mouse Positioning under Anesthesia and Surgical Site\n(A) A mouse placed on a surgical platform is administered gaseous anesthesia via nose cone during the procedure.\n(B) Overview angle of mouse brain; the injection site is marked by the star, 2 mm into the right frontal lobe.\nWeigh and record each mouse prior to placing it on the injection platform.\nIntracranial injection of GSCs\nCut away hair approximately by a 1 cm × 1 cm above the right side of the frontal lobe to expose the skin region for incision (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).",
    "Using three sterile cotton swabs, scrub the incision site with 10% iodine solution, followed by 70% isopropanol and finally 7.5% iodine solution. Using surgical scissors, cut a 0.5–1 cm opening along the middle of the disinfected area.\nUsing scissors cut a 1 cm opening into the disinfected area.\nUsing the Dremel drill with a fine tip for etching, avoiding visible veins and arteries, slowly apply pressure to the skull until the brain is reached, no further. The landmark is 2–3 mm anterior to coronal suture, 3 mm lateral to midline. Angle needle 30 degrees anterior to avoid hitting ventricle.\nUsing a 23-gauge Hamilton syringe, draw up and expel 70% ethanol to clean the syringe, followed by a rinse with PBS to ensure remaining ethanol does not kills cells.\nDraw up an appropriate amount of cell suspension, as determined from your calculations beforehand. Prepare an additional 10% of cell suspension to account for pipetting error.\nInsert the needle tip no more than 2 mm into the brain through the drill hole and slowly inject the cells. Hold steady for 2 min to allow the pressure to dissipate within the brain before withdrawing the syringe at 2 mm/min. This will avoid backpressure causing the cells to come out of the brain.\nCritical: When injecting cells intracranially, inject slowly (about 0.5 μL/s) and hold steady for 2–5 s when fully expelled to allow cells to dissipate into the tissue. Removing the syringe too quickly will cause negative pressure causing the cells to escape out of the cavity. Slow injections will ensure more consistent engraftments among mice.\nCarefully suture the incision with a double knot of dissolvable vicryl stitches and apply a small dab of surgical glue to the knot to prevent mice from reopening the site.",
    "Post-injection, using single use insulin syringes provide the mice with 1 mL of saline and painkiller according to site specific animal protocols.\nPlace mice back in their cage and provide them with a source of heat (heat pad or lamp) to aid in recovery.\nMice should be regularly monitored until they reach endpoint according to your experimental and institutional instructions. Endpoint typically consists of >10% loss in body weight, ruffled fur, and hunched back.\nMouse Specimen Collection and Processing\nTiming: 15–30 min/mouse\nThis step allows you to collect patient-derived xenografts for downstream analysis.\nCollection and processing for immunohistochemistry\nWhen mice reach endpoint, anesthetize the mice with intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/mL Avertin (18 μL/g of mouse weight). Wait until mice are unresponsive to toe pinching.\nWhile the mouse is unresponsive, lay it on its back and tape each limb to the surface. With scissors, remove the rib cage and cut the diaphragm to expose the heart without rupturing the lungs or any major circulatory components near the heart.\nInject 20 μL of Heparin sodium directly into the left ventricle of the heart to prevent blood clotting.\nAdminister 10–50 mL of saline using a 22 gauge needle into the left ventricle of the heart to flush blood from the circulatory system.\nInject 10 mL of 10% formalin using a 22 gauge needle into the heart to perfuse the body; limbs should almost immediately begin embalming.\nCarefully harvest the brain with scissors and forceps, removing the skin and skull while keeping the brain as untouched as possible. Place the brain in a tube with 5 mL (or enough to submerge the brain) 10% formalin. Store for at least 48 h in a 4oC fridge.",
    "After at least 48 h, place the brain in a coronal brain slicing matrix, slice the brain into 2 mm sections with razor blades, place each 2 mm section into a cassette (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/282-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Mouse Brain Histology\n(A) Formalin-fixed mouse brain in a coronal brain slicer matrix (left) and 2-mm-thick brain slices in tissue embedding cassettes (right).\n(B) Successful H&E staining of a human-mouse glioblastoma xenograft. Tumor cells (purple) appear infiltrative into healthy brain tissue (pink), indicative of GBM’s invasive morphology.\nWhen all sections are cut, place the cassette into 50% ethanol. After 5 min, transfer the cassette into 70% ethanol. These sequential steps will progressively remove water from the specimens without rupturing cells or damaging tissue.\nAfter at least 24 h of storage in the 70% ethanol, samples are ready to be sent for paraffin embedding and immunohistochemistry accordingly.\nTumor xenografts after successful hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) can be scanned, visualized, and quantified for tumor volume and further histological examination when needed."
