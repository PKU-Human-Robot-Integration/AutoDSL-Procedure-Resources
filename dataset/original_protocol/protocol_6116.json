    "Structural integrity of PNNs in high-magnification imagesAcquire high-magnification (40x objective lens with 5 digital zoom) multichannel (with PV or NeuN) single plane fluorescence images of individual PNNs in different experimental groups. The images should be taken from the optical plane that covers the largest perimeter of the cell.Draw a manual/automated (depending on the used software) polyline along the periphery of the cell (stained with NeuN/PV) with PNN (Figures 1A and 1B, large images).If using Nikon elements program, then use the auto ROI function to determine the perimeter of the cell followed by drawing a polyline along with this perimeter.If using Fiji/ImageJ, use the freehand line tool to draw a line along the cell perimeter followed by clicking on “Analyze” then “Plot profile” buttons.WFA peaks can be counted from the peak profile graph itself or numerical data for the plot profile can be exported to plot a graph in different software and count the peaks.After establishing the line profile, the software generates a line profile graph that shows the fluoresce intensity of WFA along the line (Figures 1A and 1B, bottom panels). The line profile graph and its numerical data can be exported in a Microsoft Excel file that has length (in µm) and fluorescence intensity as x and y-axis respectively. Peaks can be counted either from this graph generated by the acquisition program (as shown in Figures 1A and 1B, lower panels) or data can be plotted in Excel/analysis software such as Sigma plot or Origin for peak counting and representation.Mark and count the number of peaks in the line profile by setting a threshold of half the maximum intensity (Figures 1A-1B, lower panels).",
    "To determine the size of the biggest hole in the PNN, measure the distance between two consecutive peaks that appear to be farthest from each other (white double-headed arrows in lower panels in Figures 1A-1B). (Alternately, plot the data in Clampfit result window and save it as an .atf file. Open this file later and use the peak detection function to count the number of peaks. The parameters of peak detection function may detect few false peaks, which can be removed from the analysis. In addition, placing two cursers covering the gap and remarking the distance between them can be used to determine the size of the largest hole.)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190513/20190513224750_7537.jpgFigure 1. Analysis of WFA intensity peaks of PNN in two experimental conditions. A and B. High magnification (40x objective lens with 5 digital zoom) immunohistochemical staining images of WFA (green), PV (red) and overlay (large images on the right) showing single PNN in the cerebral cortex of a mouse model of glioma-associated epilepsy (A), and corresponding sham control (B). The polyline (right) along the perimeter of the PV, encompasses WFA staining and shows discrete WFA intensity peaks (marked by red arrows) separated by low WFA intensity baseline. White dotted line indicates the threshold (Maximum WFA intensity/2) to determine the WFA intensity peak. The two-headed white arrows show the highest apparent distance between two consecutive WFA peaks and indicate the size of the largest holes in the PNN. The total number of peaks are divided by the perimeter to account for the different size of cells and their PNNs. Scale bars: 5 µm.Pre-experimental degradation of PNNs in brain slicesPrepare brain slices according to the standard brain slicing protocols and after completion of the recovery use for the experiments (Papouin and Haydon, 2018, Tewari et al., 2018).",
    "Prepare the slice incubation assembly using two glass vials; make two small holes on each cap to insert the inlet and outlet needles of carbogen gas supply. Insert an appropriate length piece of tube on the tip of needles to extend the gas supply close to the surface of the buffer. Do not dip these gas tubes into the solution (it can damage the slices).Make one needle inlet by connecting it to the carbogen supplying tube and leave the other needle open to function as outlet (Figure 2B).Next, fill 3 ml well-oxygenated ACSF in each vial and add ChABC stock to make a final concentration of 0.5 U/ml of ACSF in one of the vials labeled as treated.Transfer 2-3 brain slices in each vial using a modified transfer pipette (cut the tip of transfer pipette to broaden the tip for the ease of slice transfer as shown in Figure 2C).Set timer for 45 min from the time of ChABC addition and ensure that the carbogen gas supply through the inlet is working fine.Place both the vials into a custom-made floating polystyrene foam (Figure 2D) that allows vials to stay straight while floating in the water bath during incubation.Transfer both vials into the water bath, preset at 32 °C (Figure 2E).On completion of 45 min incubation, carefully take out vials, rinse slices with ACSF, and transfer slices from both the vials back to the recovery chamber (Figure 2G). The slices can be used for experimentation now.After completion of the experiment, carefully take out slices from the experimental setup and fix overnight with 4% PFA. Stain the fixed slices with WFA (and DAPI, if needed) to confirm the PNN degradation effect of ChABC as described in Procedure D.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190513/20190513224819_6811.jpgFigure 2.

    "Brain slice recovery chamber with cortical slices in the ACSF with continuous carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2) bubbling. B. Fill the incubation vials (for control and ChABC-treated slices) with 3 ml ACSF (with/without ChABC) and assemble the carbogen gas supply tubes with an inlet and one outlet. C. Add 2-3 brain slices from (A) to each vial by modified transfer pipette (B on Petri dish) and subsequently insert the vials in the polystyrene foam to held them straight in the water bath (E) while incubating at 32 °C for 45 min (F). G. On completion of incubation, transfer slices back into the recovery chamber at room temperature for experimental purposes.PNN degradation during real time experimentation in brain slicesRecord the baseline activity of cells/slices for 5-10 min (depending on the specific experiment) in the recording setup.Superfuse 1 U/ml ChABC solution for 50 min while strictly maintaining the bath temperature at 32-33 °C (Figure 3A).After 50 min of recording, perfuse ACSF again and record the activity in the presence of ACSF for 5-10 min (Figure 3B). Stop the experiment and transfer slices to a 24-well plate and add 500 µl, 4% PFA to fix the slice and keep at room temperature for overnight.Perform WFA staining next day as described in Procedure D.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190513/20190513224843_9861.jpgFigure 3.

    "5 ml PBS that contains Biotinylated-WFA solution (1:300 in PBS), in each slice and incubate for 1 h at room temperature followed by 4 rinses with PBS at every 5 min interval.Add 0.5 ml PBS that contains Streptavidin-conjugated Alexa fluor-555 solution (1:300 in PBS), in each slice and incubate for 1 h at room temperature followed by 4 rinses with PBS at every 5 min interval.Incubate slices with PBS that contains DAPI (1:1,000 from 10 mg/ml stock in DMSO) for 4 min and rinse 3 times with PBS at every 5 min.Mount slices in between 2 coverslips that allows user to access both the surfaces of the slice for imaging. Use mounting medium and do not press hard the coverslips to prevent tissue distortion.Keep mounted tissue on a glass slide and take images of recorded cells/or regions of brain to confirm the degradation of PNNs."
