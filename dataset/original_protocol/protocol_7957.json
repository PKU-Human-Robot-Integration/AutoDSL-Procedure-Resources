    "Mouse care and all experimental procedures were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Oakland University (protocol no. 18071).\nNOTE: Names of the solutions and their compositions are listed in Table 1.\n1. Tissue preparation\nEuthanize the mouse with an overdose of CO2, followed by cervical dislocation.\nEnucleate the eyes with curved forceps and transfer them to a small petri dish with 0.1 M PBS (Table 1). Under a dissection microscope, poke a small hole along the cornea-sclera junction with a needle. Transfer to 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 hour.\nTransfer the eye back to a dish with PBS. Under a dissection microscope, use dissection scissors to cut all the way around the cornea-sclera junction. Remove the cornea and lens. Cut at the base of the optic nerve and carefully peel the sclera off with forceps to isolate the retina.\nMake four small cuts evenly around the retina and use a fine tip brush dipped in PBS to lay it flat (GCL side down) in a clover-like shape on a small square cut from nitrocellulose filter paper to stabilize the retina.\nTransfer the retina using forceps to hold the corner of the nitrocellulose paper (without touching the mounted retina) and place it in a 48-well plate with 4% PFA for 1 hour.\nTransfer the filter paper and retina to a well with PBS and wash (3x for 5 min each).\nTransfer to A4P0 (Table 1) and incubate overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation.\nPipette vegetable oil into the well to completely cover the A4P0 solution. Incubate in a water bath at 40 °C for 3 hours with no shaking.",
    "Wash (3x for 5 min each) in PBS, making sure all the oil has been rinsed off. If necessary, use a pipet to carefully remove remaining oil from the top of the well before the last rinse.\nIncubate in 10% SDS at 40 °C for two days with gentle shaking. Replace SDS with fresh solution on the second day.\nTransfer the filter paper and retina to PBS with Triton-X-100 (PBST, Table 1) and wash (5x for 1.5 h each).\nStore at 4 °C in PBST with 0.01% sodium azide (NaN3) or move directly to immunostaining.\n2. Immunostaining and refractive index matching\nRemove the retina from the filter paper by gently peeling it off with a fine tip brush in PBST.\nIncubate the retina in primary antibody (Table 2) diluted in blocking solution (Table 1) for 2 days at 40 °C with gentle shaking.\nWash (5x, 1.5 h each) in PBST.\nIncubate with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Table 3) diluted in blocking solution for 2 days at 40 °C with gentle shaking and protect from light through the remainder of the procedure.\nWash (5x, 1.5 h each) in 0.02 M phosphate buffer (see Table 1).\nIncubate in sorbitol-based Refractive Index Matching Solution (sRIMS, see Table 1) at 40 °C overnight with gentle shaking.\n3. Mounting\nOutline a 18 mm x 18 mm x 1.5 mm glass coverslip with a fine-tip permanent marker to mark a square boundary on the back of a glass microscope slide.\nFlip the slide over and use a syringe to trace the boundary with a thin line of silicone grease on the front of the slide, leaving a small gap in one corner for excess mounting solution to escape.",
    "Transfer the retina to the center of the bounded area and arrange with a fine-tip brush so that it lies flat with the photoreceptor side against the glass slide.\nPipette approximately 60 µL of sRIMS so that it covers the flattened retina and extends to one corner of the enclosure, taking care that the retina stays flat and in place.\nApply the coverslip starting from the corner with the sRIMS and slowly lower it until it touches the grease on all sides, avoiding the formation of air bubbles.\nPlace a stack of 3 coverslips on each side of the mounted retina as a spacer. Use the long edge of another slide to press down the coverslip so that the mount is flat and even.\nStore slides flat at 4 °C until imaging.\n4. Imaging\nImage samples on either a conventional fluorescence microscope or a confocal microscope (Table of Materials). Begin by placing the slide on the microscope stage and locating the sample.\n\tNOTE: If an inverted objective microscope is being used, place the slide upside down on the stage, first ensuring that the exposed areas of the slide are clear of all silicone grease and mounting solution.\nTo obtain z-stacked images of co-labeled samples, first focus on the signal in each channel individually and set the exposure time or scanning speed, for fluorescence or confocal microscopes, respectively.\nSet the range for the z-stack either by manually setting the focal plane at the top and bottom of the desired range, or by setting the midpoint and then specifying a range around the midpoint.\nAdjust the step size or number of slices as desired.\nCapture the image and save the original file as well as exporting it as a TIFF file or other desired format.\n5. Image analysis",
    "Use the image analysis software of choice (Table of Materials) to adjust the brightness and contrast in each channel until optimum clarity is achieved in both the single images and the 3-dimensional rendering of the z-stack.\n\tNOTE: If the selected step size is sufficiently small, 3D deconvolution can also be performed to enhance the signal.\nSubscription Required.
