    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDeparaffinization and slide rehydration for antigen retrieval\nTiming: 3 h\nThe goal of this section is to remove the paraffin coating on the cell pellet/tissue sections and subsequently rehydrate the cells/tissue. This is followed by an optimized HIER (heat-induced antigen retrieval) step with a specific pH 9.0 buffer to expose both nucleic acid targets for ISH and cross-linked epitopes for antibody recognition, without the need for any protease treatment.\nDeparaffinization: Place the desired slides with FFPE tissue samples in an oven at 70°C for 1 h. After the paraffin has melted, wash with xylenes 2 × 15 min in glass Coplin jars to remove residual paraffin.\nNote: While the slides are baking, prepare the Linear Stainer (step 3) and pre-warm the PT Module to 70°C (step 4). See steps 3 and 4 for their respective conditions.\nRehydration: Rehydrate the slides using a Linear Stainer set to 3 dips and 180s (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The Linear Stainer will automate the rehydration from left to right. Therefore, it is important to prepare the buffers in the following order:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1985-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Equipment setup for slide rehydration and HIER\n(A) Top: Linear Stainer setup for slide rehydration. Each jar should be filled at least three-quarters full to ensure that the tissues are fully submerged at each rinse step. The “holder” jars on the left should be empty and are used to hold extra slides on the Linear Stainer. Bottom: In lieu of a Linear Stainer, one can manually rehydrate tissues using the EasyDip Slide Staining Kit.",
    "(B) Top: PT module setup for pre-warming and HIER. The vertical tank is filled with 1× PBS, and the slide chamber is filled with freshly made 1× pH 9 Dako Retrieval Buffer. Bottom: In lieu of a PT module, HIER can be performed by placing the slides in a Staining Tray, submerging the tray in a beaker containing 1× pH 9 Dako Retrieval buffer, and boiling on a hot plate.\n3 × 180s xylenes washes.\n2 × 180s 100% Ethanol washes.\n2 × 180s 95% Ethanol washes.\n1 × 180s 80% Ethanol [refer to recipe table] wash.\n1 × 180s 70% Ethanol [refer to recipe table] wash.\n3 × 180s ddH2O washes.\nddH2O holding tank.\nNote: In lieu of a Linear Stainer, rehydration can be performed manually using a series of containers such as the EasyDip™ Slide Staining Kit [see Optional Equipment] (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, bottom).\nPause point: The slides can sit in the ddH2O holding tank for up to an hour.\nHIER: Transfer the slides from the ddH2O holding tank to a slide chamber filled with 1× pH 9 Dako Retrieval Buffer [refer to recipe table] and place in the PT module prewarmed to 70°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, top). Prepare the PT module as follows:\nThe PT module should be filled with 1× PBS [refer to recipe table]. Ensure that the PBS level is low enough such that it does not spill into the slide chambers while ensuring the PBS level is high enough not to trigger the “low water level” sensor.\nThe PT module should be set to perform HIER at 97°C for 10 min after preheating to 70°C.\nThe PT module should be set to control cooling post-HIER to 65°C.",
    "Note: While the PT module gives us the most consistent results, HIER can also be manually performed. For example, slides may be placed in a Staining Tray [see Optional Equipment], submerged in a beaker containing 1× pH 9 Dako Retrieval buffer, and boiled on a hot plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, bottom).\nOnce the PT module cools to 65°C, remove the slide chamber containing the slides and allow them to equilibrate to room temperature.\nPause point: The slides can sit in the 1× pH 9 Dako Retrieval Buffer at room temperature for up to 1 h.\nOnce the slides are cooled to room temperature, rinse in ddH2O 2 × 2 min in Coplin jars.\nFlick the slides to remove excess water and then circle the tissue sections with a hydrophobic pen using a single stroke.\nCritical: Do not allow tissues to dry out. Perform step 7 as quickly as possible but be careful not to let the hydrophobic pen contact water. Return slides to the ddH2O Coplin jars within 1 min to ensure that the tissues stay hydrated. This is also a good chance to check that the hydrophobic circle does not wash off. The integrity of the hydrophobic circle facilitates downstream blocking and staining steps by allowing reagents to be localized to the tissue.\nBlocking and target hybridization\nTiming: 1.5 h + O/N incubation",
    "The goal of this portion is to maximize on-target binding of the probes, followed by hapten deposition. This is done by blocking endogenous peroxidases with H2O2, blocking nonspecific biotin binding using a combination of avidin and biotin, and then hybridizing the probes overnight. For the highest reproducibility, we suggest trying this protocol first with RNAscope commercial kit and probes available from ACD Bio, before customizing the assay for your ISH method of choice. We have successfully adapted PANINI to other ISH methods, including custom Oligopaints probes (Beliveau et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nTransfer slides to the slide holder within the ACD HybEZ oven pan (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and use this to rinse slides 2 × 2 min in ddH2O in the ACD HybEZ oven wash trays.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1985-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Experimental setup for tissue staining and mounting\n(A) Manual hybridization system setup for nucleic acid probe amplification. The oven pan fits neatly into the interior.\n(B) Damp paper towels in the over pan are utilized to maintain humidity during the 40°C amplification steps.\n(C) A conventional oven and a humidity chamber may be used to substitute the manual hybridization system.\n(D) Humidity chamber setup for primary antibody staining. The humidity chamber is filled with water and a damp paper towel to maintain humidity during the overnight stain, and the lid is wrapped with aluminum foil to accommodate potential light-sensitive reagents.\n(E) Setup for slide washing. The second wash of the previous step can be used as the first wash of the new step, for reagent conservation. This setup is applicable to all amplification steps.\n(F) Staining tissue sections with a dropper. Gently drip enough buffer (1–3 drops) before using the tip to spread the buffer across the tissue without touching it.",
    "(G) Mounting the tissue section. First drip the glass coverslip with 40 μL of mounting medium, then place the tissue slide over the No. 1 glass coverslip (22 × 50 mm) with the tissue side facing the coverslip. Excess bubbles are removed as needed.\nWhile slides are rinsing, retrieve the Probes from 4°C and place them in a warm water bath (37°C–40°C) such that they are standing with the water line below the cap. This is to prevent any potential salt precipitation in the probes. Do not submerge the Probes in water to minimize possible contamination.\nTurn on the oven and prewarm it to 40°C with the tray inside.\nThe oven tray should have a ddH2O-dampened paper towel inside to create humidity and ensure the slides do not dry out (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: We highly recommend using equipment from the ACD HybEZ oven system from henceforth. If unavailable, users may substitute this with a different oven and a homemade humidity chamber (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C), but temperature consistency during the downstream steps cannot be guaranteed. If using a homemade humidity chamber, fill the base of an empty pipette tip box with water and place a paper towel inside to retain moisture. Wrap the lid with aluminum foil so that it can also be used for light-sensitive work (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: Additionally, we use the associated wash trays for all the wash steps; if using alternative equipment, we recommend doing all washes in EasyDip™ Slide Staining Kit (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, bottom). To conserve reagents during the wash steps, users can reuse the second wash of the previous step for the first wash of the following step (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). This ensures that the wash buffer can be changed once per wash cycle instead of twice.",
    "Drop 1–2 drops of RNAscope H2O2 [part of the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents v2 kit] on each slide, or more to ensure the tissue is appropriately covered. Incubate for 20 min at 40°C.\nNote: An effective way to distribute the RNAscope H2O2 and other reagents across the entire section is to gently spread the liquid using the tip of the dropper bottle. Ensure the tip does not directly touch the tissue section to avoid contamination and disrupting the tissue (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F). Readers are referred to Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]. This technique is applicable to all reagents dropped onto the slides throughout this protocol.\nCritical: The RNAscope H2O2 should completely cover the tissue and be sufficient to not evaporate during incubation, but also should not overflow over the hydrophobic circle. This applies to all reagents added to the tissue from this point forward.\nRinse slides 2 × 2 min in ddH2O in the HybEZ Oven wash pans.\nDuring this rinse, leave the oven pan at room temperature to cool.\nAdd 1–2 drops of Avidin Block [see Critical Commercial Assays] to each slide and incubate in the oven pan at room temperature for 15 min.\nRinse slides 2 × 2 min in ddH2O.\nAdd 1–2 drops of Biotin Block [see Critical Commercial Assays] to each slide and incubate in the oven pan at room temperature for 15 min.\nNote: If users choose to use a different hapten instead of biotin, steps 9–12 can be skipped.\nRinse slides 2 × 2 min in ddH2O.\nDuring this rinse, prewarm the pan in the oven.\nDouble-check the oven is still set to 40°C.",
    "Add 1–2 drops of the aliquoted nucleic acid probes [see Probes and Antibodies] to each slide. For example, here we combine two different probes to target SIV DNA and SIV RNA [see Probes and Antibodies].\nIf using a different set and/or number of probes, combine them according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\nBe sure to gently mix the probes well before dropping them onto the tissue.\nIncubate overnight at 40°C in the dark, with the slide containing the probes exposed inside the humidity chamber. In our experience, this allows for a cleaner result when compared to using a coverslip. Ensure that the paper towels are still wet, so that the pan is humid enough to prevent the probes from evaporating overnight.\nThis is a good step to switch over to any customized probes or alternative ISH methods. Please adjust the annealing temperature and time according to your optimized assays. For instance, our optimized Oligopaints probe hybridization occurs at 42°C.\nPause point: Probes should hybridize for at least 4 h and up to 48 h. In our experience, an overnight hybridization (15–18 h) works well.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "This section of the protocol describes the series of amplification steps to boost the signal of the DNA and RNA targeting probes by using RNAscope reagents [see Critical Commercial Assays]. The first three amplification steps occur concurrently, but the subsequent amplifications are split in a channel-specific manner for Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) and hapten deposition. Here, we use biotin and DIG for viral DNA and RNA respectively, but users may choose to use different haptens.\nRemove Amps 1–4 [part of the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents v2 kit] from 4°C to room temperature.\nPlace Amp1 bottle in a water bath at 37°C. Do not submerge the probes in water to minimize contamination risks.\nPrepare an ice bucket to store the Amps after their respective applications.\nRemove slides from the 40°C oven and wash 2 × 2 min in 0.5× Wash Buffer [refer to recipe table].\nBe sure to note the start and stop time of incubation.\nAdd 1–2 drops of Amp1 to each slide and then incubate at 40°C for 30 min.\nPlace the Amp2 bottle in the front nook of the oven during the incubation to pre-warm it.\nNote: If using an alternative oven, be sure to prewarm Amp2 and subsequent Amp bottles that require preheating in a water bath set to 40°C.\nWash 2 × 2 min in 0.5× Wash Buffer.\nDuring the wash, place the pan and Amp2 back in the oven to keep them warm.\nAdd 1–2 drops of Amp2 to each slide and then incubate at 40°C for 15 min.\nPlace the Amp3 bottle in the front of the oven during the incubation to pre-warm it.\nWash 2 × 2 min in 0.5× Wash Buffer.\nDuring the wash, place the pan and Amp3 back in the oven to keep them warm.",
    "Add 1–2 drops of Amp3 to each slide and then incubate at 40°C for 30 min.\nPlace the Amp4 HRP-C1 bottle [part of the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents v2 kit] in the front of the oven during the incubation to pre-warm it.\nWash 2 × 2 min in 0.5× Wash Buffer.\nDuring the wash, place the pan and V2 Amp4 back in the oven to keep them warm.\nAdd 1–2 drops of V2 Amp4 to each slide and then incubate at 40°C for 15 min in the dark.\nRemove Amp5 and Amp6 bottles [part of the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection Reagent- BROWN] from 4°C and allow them to equilibrate to room temperature. Do NOT prewarm these reagents to 40°C or the reaction will not be specific.\nWash 2 × 2 min in 0.5× Wash Buffer.\nDuring the wash, leave the pan uncovered at room temperature to cool.\nNote: If not using the ACD Bio HybEZ oven system, leave the humidity chamber out of the oven during the steps in which the pan is left uncovered at room temperature.\nThe following three steps use additional reagents from the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection Reagent- BROWN kit, which further boosts the TSA reaction required for robust visualization of DNA targets. This step may be skipped if only abundant RNA is intended for visualization. These reagents should NOT be pre-warmed to 40°C to avoid assay failure.\nAdd 1–2 drops of brown kit Amp5 [part of the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection Reagent- BROWN] to each slide and then incubate at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.\nWash 2 × 2 min in 1× TBS-T [refer to recipe table].\nKeep the pan at room temperature.",
    "Add 1–2 drops of brown kit Amp6 [part of the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection Reagent- BROWN] to each slide and then incubate at room temperature for 15 min in the dark.\nDuring the incubation, prepare the TSA buffer [refer to recipe table] and TSA reagents (TSA-Biotin and TSA-DIG) [refer to recipe table].\nNote: Make the TSA buffer fresh and do not add 30% H2O2 Solution until immediately before use. TSA DIG can be placed on ice until needed.\nWash 2 × 2 min in 1× TBS-T.\nAdd 50–100 μL of the prepared TSA-Biotin to each slide and then incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nIn general, 50–100 μL would suffice to cover the entire tissue.\nWash 2 × 2 min in 0.5× Wash Buffer.\nAdd 1–2 drops of HRP-Blocker [part of the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents v2 kit] to each slide and then incubate at 40°C for 15 min.\nHRP-Blocker should be kept on ice.\nPlace Amp4 HRP C2 [part of the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents v2 kit] in the front of the oven during the incubation to pre-warm it.\nCritical: This step will fail at room temperature; make sure the incubation is at 40°C. Ensure the slides are covered as the reaction is light-sensitive.\nWash 2 × 2 min in 0.5× Wash Buffer.\nDuring the wash, place the pan and Amp4 HRP C2 back in the oven to keep them warm.\nAdd 1–2 drops of Amp4 HRP C2 to each slide and then incubate at 40°C for 15 min in the dark.\nWash 2 × 2 min in 0.5× Wash Buffer.\nAdd 50–100 μL of the prepared TSA-DIG to each slide and then incubate at room temperature for 15 min in the dark.\nCritical: Ensure the slides are covered as the reaction is light-sensitive.",
    "Wash 2 × 2 min in 1× TBS-T.\nRemove slides and wash 2 × 5 min in Staining Wash Buffer [refer to recipe table] in a Coplin jar.\nTransfer slides to a humidity chamber and add ∼100 μL of Antibody Blocking Buffer [refer to recipe table] to each slide while ensuring the tissues are fully covered. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nIf the slides are to be used with a multiplexed imaging modality, such as the CODEX and MIBI, this step can be streamlined into their respective antibody blocking steps.\nPause point: Slides can be left to block for up to 3 h.\nPrepare the Primary Antibody Cocktail [refer to recipe table] while waiting for the block to complete. Once complete, add 100 μL of the primary antibody cocktail per slide.\nThe antibodies used here have been optimized at a concentration of 1:100 antibody to Antibody Diluent [refer to recipe table].\nNote: Users should carefully select primary antibodies based on the study design and validate via immunohistochemistry (IHC) on FFPE tissue or cell pellet sections. However, anti-hapten antibodies (e.g., anti-DIG) must be included as it is needed to visualize hybridization probes.\n[Optional] Secondary antibody staining\nTiming: 2 h\nThe goal of secondary antibody staining is to label the bound primary antibodies with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies for imaging using a standard fluorescence microscope. This step should be skipped for other high-plex imaging modalities.\nNote: The need for secondary antibody staining depends on the primary antibody, sample type, and imaging modality. For instance, it is not needed if the slides are to be imaged with a high-plex imaging modality, such as the CODEX and MIBI.\nRemove slides from the humidity chamber and wash 2 × 5 min in Staining Wash Buffer.",
