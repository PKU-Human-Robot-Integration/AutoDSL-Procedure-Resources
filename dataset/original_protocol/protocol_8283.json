    "All procedures involving animals were accepted by the ethical committee of the institution.\n1. Solution Preparation\nPrepare 10 mL of 4% BSA dialyzed in L-15 medium.\n\t\nDissolve bovine serum albumin powder at 4% (w/v) in 10 mL of L-15 medium.\nAdd the solution to a 20 mL dialysis cassette with a 20 kDa cut-off. Dialyze against 500 mL of L-15 medium for 3 days under agitation at 4 °C. Change the L-15 medium every day.\nFilter the solution through a 0.22 µm membrane and aliquot in 15 mL tubes. Store the tubes at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol uses the following references: unmodified raw L-15 medium = L-15 medium, acidic L-15 medium = pH L-15, and basic L-15 medium = Bicarbonate L-15.\nPrepare 200 mL of pH L-15.\n\t\nAdjust the pH of the L-15 medium: First, fill a wash-bottle with some pieces of dry ice. Inject gas (CO2) into the L-15 medium until the color turns orange (~pH 6.4 and ~40 pressures). The pH can be also adjusted with a standard pH meter.\nFilter the medium through a 0.22 µm membrane and store at 4 °C for one month.\nPrepare 100 mL of Bicarbonate L-15.\n\t\nAdd 2.5 mL of 7% sodium bicarbonate to 97.5 mL of L-15 medium and store at 4 °C.\nPrepare the IPCS (Insulin Putrescin Conalbumin Selenite) supplements.\n\t\nDissolve 2.5 mg of insulin in 0.5 mL of 0.1 M HCl. Add 4.5 mL of double-distilled water.\nDissolve 8 mg of putrescine in 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nDissolve 100 mg of conalbumin in 10 mL of PBS.\nDissolve 1 mg of sodium selenite in 19.3 mL of water, adjust the pH to 7.4, and dilute the solution 10-fold.",
    "Combine 1 mL of insulin solution, 1 mL of putrescine solution, 1 mL of conalbumin, and 0.1 mL of sodium selenite solution to obtain 3.1 mL of IPCS supplement solution. Store the solution at -20 °C.\nPrepare a 0.02 mM progesterone solution.\n\t\nDissolve 1 mg of progesterone in 1.6 mL of 80% ethanol.\nDilute the solution 100-fold in 100% ethanol and store it at -20 °C.\nPrepare 100 mL of complete L-15 medium.\n\t\nAdd 1.8 mL of D-glucose solution (200 mg/mL) to 92 mL of pH L-15 to obtain a final concentration of 3.5 mg/mL glucose.\nCombine 1 mL of 100x Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL), 2 mL of heat-inactivated horse serum, 3.1 mL of IPCS mix, and 0.1 mL of progesterone solution (2 x 10-5 M).\nFilter the medium on a 0.22 µm membrane and store it at 4 °C.\nPrepare 5 mL of density gradient solution (final concentration of 5.5%) per experiment.\n\t\nAdd 476 µL of the commercial 60% density gradient medium to 4524 µL of L-15 (if possible, without red phenol to increase the visual contrast at the interphase; dilution ratio of 1:10.5).\nStore the solution at 4 °C for 2 weeks or freeze it at -20 °C.\nPrepare 10 mL of culture media.\n\t\nAdd 200 µL of supplement medium to 9.6 mL of neuron cell culture medium.\nAdd 200 µL of heat-inactivated horse serum (which tends to differentiate glial cell precursors and works against proliferation) to 25 µL of glutamine and 10 µL of 2-mercaptoethanol.\nFilter the media through a 0.22 µm filter.\nAdd the following neurotrophic factors: ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) at a final concentration of 10 ng/mL, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) at final concentrations of 1 ng/mL.\nStore the media at 4 °C.",
    "Prepare 50 mL of dissection media.\n\t\nAdd 2.25 mL of glucose (200 mg/mL) to 47.05 mL of HBSS. Add 700 µL of 1 M HEPES with pH 7.4. Store the media at 4 °C.\nPrepare a 4% PFA solution.\n\t\nDissolve 20 g of PFA in 500 mL of PBS.\nUnder a chemical hood, heat the solution to 60 °C and add a few drops of 1 M NaOH until the solution becomes clear.\nFilter the solution through a filter paper and adjust the pH to 7.2. Store it at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, other commercial PFA solutions can be used and diluted to 4% in PBS.\nClean the dissection tools including the forceps, scissors, and silicone dishes with 70% ethanol before use, and with soap and clear water after use.\n2. Poly-ornithine/Laminin (Po/L) Dish Coating\nNOTE: Volumes are adapted to coat a 24-well plate.\nIf needed, put a sterile 12 mm coverslip in the well.\nCoat the wells with 500 µL of 10 µg/mL Poly-L-Ornithine solution dissolved in water.\nLet the wells settle at room temperature for 1 h.\nRemove the Poly-L-Ornithine solution and air-dry for 30 min.\nCoat the wells overnight at 37 °C with 500 µL of 3 µg/mL laminin in bicarbonate L-15.\n\tNOTE: Wells can be stored at 37 °C for 7 days in the incubator. For long incubations, adding sterile PBS between the wells can help to avoid medium evaporation.\n3. Dissection\nSacrifice a pregnant mouse when the embryos are at embryonic stage E12.5. Clean the belly with 70% ethanol.\nRemove the womb by cutting the two oviducts and the vagina and put it in a Petri dish filled with cold PBS (without Ca2+ Mg2+).\nCollect all the embryos and transfer them to fresh, cold PBS (without Ca2+ Mg2+) in a Petri dish.",
    "Put one embryo in a dish coated with silicone and full of dissection media (with HBSS, 4.5 g/L glucose, and 7 mM HEPES pH 7.4).\n\tNOTE: Embryo dissection is performed under a microscope using clean fine forceps and scissors. Alternatively, a regular Petri dish without silicone can be used for dissection.\nRemove the head, tail, and viscera, using forceps as scissors.\nMaintain the embryo with the belly against the silicone with forceps.\nWith a second pair of forceps, insert one of the tips into the central canal of the rostral spinal cord.\nClose the forceps to tear the dorsal tissue a few millimeters.\nRepeat this operation toward the caudal side until the entire spinal cord is open (Figure 1B).\nDetach the rostral part of the spinal cord (cerebral trunk) from the body.\nTurn the embryo to maintain the open spinal cord against the silicone.\nPinch the rostral part of the spinal cord and pull the embryo by the head to extract the spinal cord.\n\tNOTE: Meninges and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) should remain attached to the embryo. Otherwise, carefully pull away any remaining meninges and DRGs still attached to the spinal cord. At this step, DRGs could also be collected for sensitive neuron culture (see Discussion).\nFlatten the spinal cord on the silicone and remove the dorsal half of the cord by cutting along the middle of each side using a scalpel. Cut the middle part into 10 pieces using a scalpel, and transfer the pieces to a new tube.\n4. Spinal Cord Cell Suspension\nRepeat this dissection procedure for 6 to 8 spinal cords.\nLet the spinal cord pieces collect at the bottom of the tube and replace the HBSS with 1 mL of Ham-F10 medium.",
    "Add 10 µL of trypsin (2.5% w/v; final concentration 0.025%). Incubate the tube for 10 min at 37 °C.\nTo stop the enzymatic digestion, transfer the fragments to a new 15 mL tube containing 800 µL of complete L-15 medium, 100 µL of 4% (w/v) BSA, and 100 µL of DNase (1 mg/mL in L-15 medium).\nTriturate twice by aspirating 1 mL using a P1000 pipette. Let the fragments settle for 2 min. Collect the supernatant in a fresh 15 mL tube.\nTo the fragments, add 900 µL of complete L-15 medium, 100 µL of 4% (w/v) BSA, and 100 µL of DNase (1 mg/mL in L-15 medium).\nTriturate 6 times by aspirating 1 mL using a P1000 pipette. Let the fragments settle for 2 min. Add the supernatant to the 15 mL tube obtained in step 4.5.\nTo the fragments, add 900 µL of complete L-15 medium, 100 µL of 4% (w/v) BSA, and 100 µL of DNase (1 mg/mL in L-15 medium).\nTriturate 10 times by aspirating 1 mL using a P1000 pipette. Let the fragments settle for 2 min. Add the supernatant to the 15 mL tube obtained in step 4.5. Proceed with the supernatant.\nUsing a P1000 pipet, gently place a 2 mL BSA 4% (w/v) cushion at the bottom of supernatant tube. Centrifuge at 470 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 2 mL of complete L-15 medium.\n5. MN Enrichment by Gradient Density\nSplit the cell suspension into two 15 mL tubes (1 mL each). Then, add 2 mL of complete L-15 medium. If starting with 6 embryos, use the equivalent of 3 embryos per tube in 3 mL of medium.",
    "Add 2 mL of density gradient solution by slowly adding the solution to the bottom of each tube to obtain a sharp interface.\nCentrifuge at 830 x g for 15 min at room temperature. After this step, small cells should be at the bottom of the tube, whereas large cells such as MNs should be at the density gradient solution/medium interface.\nCollect the cells at the interface by aspirating 1 or 2 mL and transfer them to a fresh 15 mL tube. Adjust the volume to 10 mL with L-15 pH medium.\nAdd 2 mL of the 4% BSA cushion to the bottoms of the tube and centrifuge at 470 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of complete L-15 medium.\nRepeat step 5.5.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of complete culture medium. Count the cell number and viability under a phase contrast microscope with a hemocytometer.\n\tNOTE: For 6 spinal cords, the cell number is expected to be around 1 x 105 MNs.\n6. MN Culture\nDilute the MNs to the appropriate density, usually 5,000 to 10,000 cells in 500 µL of culture medium per well in a 24-well plate.\n\tNOTE: Seeding density is around 30,000 and 1,500 cells for 6- and 96-well plates, respectively.\nRemove the laminin solution with a P1000.\nImmediately transfer the MNs diluted in culture medium into the coating plates to avoid drying.\nIncubate the culture for 2 days at 37 °C.\n7. Magnetofection of MNs\nNOTE: In the following steps, the quantities used are meant for the transfection of one well of a 24-well plate. Please refer to the manufacturer's protocol for another format.",
    "For the DNA preparation, resuspend 1 µg of DNA in 50 µL of neuronal culture medium and vortex for 5 s.\nFor bead tube preparation, resuspend 1.5 µL of beads in 50 µL of neuronal culture medium.\nAdd the 50 µL bead solution to the 50 µL DNA solution and incubate for 20 min at room temperature (total volume = 100 µL).\nDuring this incubation, withdraw 100 µL of culture medium from the well that will be transfected.\n\tNOTE: Put the magnetic plate in the incubator to warm it to 37 °C.\nTransfer 100 µL of the DNA/bead mix to the well, and incubate the plate 20–30 min on the magnetic plate at 37 °C.\nWait at least 24 h before detection of cDNA expression.\n8. Fixation and Staining\nWash the culture 2 times with PBS.\nIncubate the culture for 20 min at room temperature in 4% PFA/PBS.\nWash the culture 2 times with PBS.\nIncubate the culture in 500 µL of blocking buffer (PBS, 4% BSA, 2% normal serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.1 M glycine) for 1 h at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Normal serum should be derived from the same species as the secondary antibody (e.g., Normal Goat Serum).\nIncubate the culture overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in 250 µL of blocking buffer.\n\tNOTE: For example, TUJ1 is used at 1/1000, SMI32 is used at 1/1,000, and Lc3b is used at 1/200.\nWash the culture 3 times with PBS.\nIncubate the culture with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in 250 µL of blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature.\nWash the culture 3 times with PBS.\nMount on glass slides using mounting medium.\nSubscription Required.
