    "Animal handling and all experiments with them were strictly performed according to protocols that were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Notre Dame (Protocol number 14-086).\n1. Animals\nAnimals and Stroke initiation: Use male Sprague Dawley Rats weighing between 220 and 270 g for all stroke studies.\nAnesthetize rats with 2.5% isofluorane (2 L/min in 100% O2) using a nose cone.\nPlace the animal in dorsal recumbency on a heating pad. Tape down the front legs.\nShave ventralsurface of neck. Prep the shaved area with 70% EtOH followed by 10% providone iodine solution.\nSterile instruments are used for this procedure; gloves are replaced after the prep of the animal. Sterile tip techniques are employed.\nUsing scissors, make a 2-2.5 cm incision parallel to the trachea, 0.5 cm to the right of the trachea. Using blunt dissection locate the carotid artery.\nUse retractors to help visualize the vessel. Place a micro clamp on the common carotid artery (CCA).\nLocate the first branching point which will be the external carotid artery (ECA) and the internal carotid artery (ICA). Cauterize smaller branches attached to the ECA, such as the occipital artery.\nLigate the ECA near the branch to the thyroid artery with a 4-0 silk suture. The sutures should have extra length to enable hemostats to hold the suture.\nCauterize the ECA above the suture (cranially). To clamp the suture with the hemostats, pull the ECA caudally and it will be parallel with the CCA.\nLocate the ICA and use another micro clamp to occlude this artery.\nMake a small hole in the ECA using small spring scissors. Insert the occluder into the ECA and tie a suture around the occluder to prevent blood flow.",
    "Remove the micro clamp on the ICA and advance the occluder till resistance is felt.\n\tNOTE Make sure the occluder advances into the ICA and not the pterygopalatin artery. The occluder should advance smoothly and the white tip should not be seen if the occluder is properly placed.\nRemove the micro clamp from the CCA. Cut any excess occluder or suture.\nPlace 9 mm Auto Clips to close the skin incision.\nRemove the animal from anesthesia and allow animal to awaken. After 2 hr:\n\t\nAnesthetize rat with isoflurane.\nRemove the wound clips.\nLocate the end of the occluder and remove it from the middle cerebral artery by gently pulling on it until the white tip of the occluder comes into contact with the sutures. Do not pull it all the way out, this will cause bleeding.\nReplace the wound clips to the incision.\nRemove the animal from anesthesia and allow animal to awaken.\n2. Image Acquisition\nPerform three PET and CT scans for each rat. Take a pre scan 1-2 days before inducing stroke, to provide a baseline for 18F-FDG uptake. Scan each rat 1.5 hr after stroke, before reperfusion is performed (image with occluder still in the animal). Scan each rat 26 hr post stroke (24 hr post reperfusion) to quantify brain tissue damage due to stroke injury.\nNOTE: The 24 hr time point mentioned in the rest of the manuscript refers to the post reperfusion time when the rats were scanned.\nAnaesthetize rats under 2.5% isofluorane gas in anesthesia chamber.\nInject approximately 500 µCi of 18F-deoxyglucose (FDG) (200 µl total volume) into tail vein of rat.\nWait 1 hr.\nPlace anaesthetized rat on standard rat bed, under nose cone isofluorane anesthesia. Measure distance in mm between nose of rat and edge of rat bed for horizontal offset.",
    "3. Image Acquisition\nOpen Albira Suite software.\nSelect Acquirer.\nName new study.\nUnder PET or SPECT click Add > Select PET protocol. Click Add.\nUnder CT click Add > Select CT protocol. Click Add.\nClick number under Initial Horizontal Position under PET. Set number to measured distance in mm between nose of rat and front of rat bed. Repeat for CT.\nSet Subject to Rat and enter weight in grams.\nSet Compound to FDG.\nSet Injection Time and Injection Date and Dose.\nClick Start Study button.\n\tNOTE: Upon completion of PET CT scan, data will be saved automatically.\nOpen Albira Reconstructor.\nChange Pending to Last 10 or All.\nSelect scan file name.\nClick Add.\nClick Start Reconstruction. NOTE: File will be saved in MicroPET format.\n4. Image Analysis\nPerform image analysis using the PMOD analysis software in conjunction with the W. Schiffer Brain Atlas.\n\t\nOpen PMOD > Fusion.\nNavigate to the CoRegistration Preprocessing tab at the top of the screen.\nOpen the Load Reference drop-down menu at the center of the screen and select NifTI. Navigate to C://PMOD3.2/resources/templates/usertemplates. Select Rat(W.Schiffer)-FDG.nii and click Open.\nOpen the Load Input drop-down menu at the right of the screen and select MicroPET. Navigate to the desired MicroPET file. Select it and click Open.\nNavigate to the Manual CoRegistration tab at the top of the screen.\nSelect the fourth tab in the middle group of tabs on the right (Reslicing).\n\t\tNOTE: Two buttons will appear on the MicroPET scans.",
    "Use the open white rectangle to rotate the MicroPET scans and the filled white rectangle to move the MicroPET scans. Align the two scans. To do this, locate landmarks like the harderian glands, and top and rear cerebral features which can be used to match the MicroPET scan with the brain model. Then, adjust the MicroPET scan until it matches up with the brain atlas (W. Schiffer).\n\t\tNOTE: For example, the harderian glands appear bright on both the MicroPET scans and the brain atlas (W. Schiffer), and can be used as a reference for alignment.\nIf required, rotate the MicroPET scan 180° in the coronal view and raise the scan significantly in the sagittal view, along with other minor orientation changes.\nNavigate to the Full Screen Fusion (VOIs) tab at the top of the screen.\nSelect Source A at the top right of the screen.\nNavigate to Template > Atlas at the bottom of the page.\nSelect Rat (W. Schiffer) from the drop-down menu.\n\t\tNOTE: (Optional) Return to the Manual CoRegistration tab where the atlas should appear overlaid on brain atlas (W. Schiffer). The atlas can be used to help align the MicroPET scan and the brain atlas (W. Schiffer). After alignment, return to the Full Screen Fusion (VOIs) tab. A template will appear on the brain, indicating which sections of the brain will be measured for the VIO Statistics.\nSelect Source B at the top right of the screen.\nSelect the VOI Statistics button at the top right of the screen.\n\t\tNOTE: A spreadsheet will appear.\nSelect Save.\n\t\tNOTE: A Write As [VOI Statistics] window will appear.\nSelect Save to File System.\n\t\tNOTE: A PMOD (save): choose components window will appear.\nIn the file name field, type the desired file name.\nSelect Save.",

Calculate the ratio of the right side of a brain section to the left side of a brain section by dividing the value of the right side of the brain by the left side of the brain. The brain section belonging to the right side of the brain is listed before the section belonging to the left side of the brain. Repeat this for all the brain sections.\nSelect a new cell. Use the AVERAGE function to calculate the average of each of the previously calculated ratios across all the mice.\nSelect a new cell.
