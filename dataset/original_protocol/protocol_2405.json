The cells are seeded at a density to yield a ∼70% confluent cell culture on the day of transfection. This protocol is also compatible with other cell lines expressing TetR.\nCulture TRExTM-293 cells in complete medium consisting of 10 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) tetracycline-free FBS and 1× penicillin-streptomycin (at final concentration of 1 unit/mL of penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin) 37°C and 5% CO2 in 100 mm tissue culture plates.\nPassage the cells when they reach 80%–90% confluency by removing the culture medium and washing the cells once with pre-warmed (37°C) 1× PBS.\nAspirate the PBS and add 1 mL of 0.025% (w/v) 1× trypsin-EDTA at 37°C.\nWait for 1 min to allow for cellular dissociation from the cell culture plate.\nAdd 9 mL of pre-warmed (37°C) complete medium to stop the reaction.\nPipette well to suspend the cells and transfer 2 mL of the cell suspension to a new 100 mm tissue culture plate containing 8 mL of fresh pre-warmed complete medium.\nNote: Passage cells every 2–3 days at a splitting ratio of 1:5 − 1:10 to prevent fully confluent cultures and maintain cell viability.\nIf cells are ready to be set up for transfection, then count the cells and seed according to experiment. 60 mm plates are used below for the DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation (DRIP) as more cells are required for this assay.\nTake a 20 μL aliquot of the cell suspension and mix it 1:1 with Trypan blue before counting cells using a hemocytometer.",
    "To have cells at ∼70% confluence in a 60 mm plate, seed 2.0 ×106 cells per 60 mm tissue culture plate containing pre-warmed and fresh complete medium. Place the plates at 37°C and 5% CO2 for next day transfection.\nOn the day of transfection, prepare Tet+ complete medium by adding 10 μL of the 1 mg/mL tetracycline stock solution to 10 mL of pre-warmed complete medium in a 50 mL conical tube (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2042-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Overview of the co-transfection of cells with RED/dRED plasmid and sgRNAs\n(A) Change the media for the cells by adding Tet+ media.\n(B) For mixture A, mix Tube A (containing Lipofectamine 3000 and Opti-Mem) with Tube B (containing Plasmid DNA, P3000, and Opti-Mem), and incubate for 15 min at 21°C–25°C. For mixture B, mix Tube A (containing RNAiMAX and Opti-Mem) with Tube B (containing sgRNAs and Opti-Mem), and incubate for 5 min at 21°C–25°C. After incubation, add both Mix A and Mix B to the cells.\nNote: The final concentration of tetracycline in the Tet+ complete medium can be modified as needed to reflect the optimal RED/dRED induction conditions revealed by tetracycline titration in steps 10–20 (before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]).\nPrepare two master mixes for plasmid transfections using the following volumes per 60 mm cell culture dish. Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2042_11.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2042_12.csv\nAdd Tube A to Tube B to create mix A and mix well by pipetting.\nIncubate for 15 min at 21°C–25°C.\nAdd 500 μL of the combined mixture to cells dropwise.\nPrepare the sgRNA transfection mix and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX mix by combining the following for each 60 mm cell culture dish:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2042_13.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2042_14.csv\nCritical: Include a non-targeting sgRNA control.\nNote: Volumes listed are for one 60 mm plate. Scale up master mix according to experimental needs.",
    "Note: Test the number of sgRNAs required for successful targeting by including conditions in which cells are transfected with different pools of sgRNAs and with each of the sgRNA used in such pools individually. The total concentration of sgRNAs per experimental condition should remain constant. The sgRNAs used here are in Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2042-Mmc1.pdf].\nIncubate Tube A for 1 min at 21°C–25°C.\nNote: If using a pool of sgRNAs, add 1.5 μL of each sgRNAs to the same Tube B. In this case the volume of the non-targeting sgRNA control should be equivalent to the total volume of sgRNAs in the pool. So, for 3 sgRNAs in a pool, the volume of the non-targeting sgRNA control would be 4.5 μL (3 × 1.5 μL).\nAdd 375 μL of Tube A to each sgRNA mix tube (Tube B) to make mix B and incubate for 5 min at 21°C–25°C.\nGradually drip 750 μL of the combined mix onto the cells before incubating them for 36 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 (see troubleshooting #1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: Test different incubation lengths to achieve optimal RED/dRED protein expression with minimal cell toxicity.\nDNA-RNA immunoprecipitation (DRIP) to measure LasR-based R-loop modulation\nTiming: 4–5 days",
    "We describe a DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation (DRIP) protocol (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) that uses both commercially available and reagents generated in-house. Specifically, we use an anti-RNA-DNA hybrid (S9.6) antibody purified in-house from mouse hybridoma cells (ATCC, HB-8730). In this protocol, we digest genomic DNA with a cocktail of restriction enzymes and confirm digestion using agarose gel electrophoresis. The input DNA and DNA from IPs are purified using a commercially available Gel/PCR DNA Fragment Extraction Kit and used in qPCR. If assessing R-loop modulation in trans, as in the case of the rDNA shown in this protocol, include qPCR primers for both the targeted locus (i.e., IGS28) and the R-loop-containing locus modulated in trans (i.e., IGS18) (Abraham et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). If assessing R-loop modulation in cis, as in the case of the β-ACTIN locus shown elsewhere (Khosraviani et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]), include the qPCR primers that generate PCR amplicons that are within the vicinity of the sgRNA sites as summarized further below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2042-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Overview of DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation (DRIP) using the S9.6 antibody\nCo-transfected cells are first lysed, and the proteins are digested (steps 14–18). Genomic DNA (gDNA) is isolated (steps 19–31) followed by a 15–18 h digestion with restriction enzymes (steps 32–48) to obtain DNA fragments of 200–500 bp. The digested DNA is incubated for 15–18 h with the S9.6 antibody (Ab) that detects the RNA-DNA hybrid moiety of R-loops (steps 49–53). The immunocomplexes are precipitated and washed, DNA fragments are purified, and qPCR is run to measure RNA-DNA signals (steps 54–67).\nCell culture and RED/dRED induction conditions can be performed as presented herein previously. Remove the cell culture medium and wash cells twice with 5 mL of ice-cold 1× PBS.\nCritical: Wash three times if the culture medium contains toxic drugs. Dispose of the toxic liquid waste according to the biosafety guidelines.",
    "Add 5 mL 1× PBS to each plate. Gently scrape the cells into a 15 mL conical tube.\nPellet the cells gently by centrifuging at 270 × g for 5 min at 21°C–25°C.\nResuspend the cells in 1.6 mL of TE.\nAdd 41.5 μL of 20% SDS and 5 μL of 20 mg/mL proteinase K. To resuspend the cells, gently pipette up and down with a 1,000 μL micropipette tip, which one can cut to widen the tip orifice and minimize cellular stress during pipetting.\nIncubate with constant rotation for 15–18 h at 37°C.\nAdd 1.6-mL of phenol-chloroform to each tube.\nCritical: Perform this step under the fume hood and wear PPE.\nGently invert to mix the tube, then centrifuge it at 450 × g for 5 min at 21°C–25°C.\nUse a widened 1,000 μL micropipette tip (as in step 129) to carefully transfer the top aqueous layer (∼1.5 mL) to a new conical tube.\nAdd 1.4 mL of phenol-chloroform and repeat major steps 20 and 21.\nWhile samples are being centrifuged, add 80 μL of 3 M NaOAc pH 5.2 and 1,920 μL of 100% EtOH to a new 15 mL conical tube.\nTransfer 800 μL of the aqueous phase from step 22 to the tube from step 23.\nGently mix by inverting the tube until a ‘whitish’ fiber-like precipitate appears.\nCritical: Do not centrifuge to pellet the DNA as this can promote RNA contamination and interfere with immunoprecipitation.\nSpool the DNA fiber with a 100 μL micropipette tip and transfer the DNA fiber into a 1.5 mL tube.\nWash the DNA fiber five times each with 1,000 μL of 70% EtOH and gentle inverting of the tube to allow the fibers to settle.",
    "Critical: Do not centrifuge to pellet the DNA as this can promote RNA contamination and interfere with immunoprecipitation.\nAfter the final wash, carefully remove as much of the EtOH as possible.\nDry the genomic DNA (gDNA) pellets for 2–3 h at 21°C–25°C.\nCarefully add 200 μL of TE to each tube.\nUsing a cut 200 μL micropipette tip, very gently resuspend the gDNA pellet.\nCritical: The mixture will be viscous, and the DNA fibers will be visible. Do not pipette excessively or vortex.\nFor each sample, mix the following in a fresh 1.5 mL tube on ice:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2042_15.csv\nNote: Buffers and restriction enzymes used here should be relevant to the experiment or genome of interest.\nNote: Genomic DNA should be added last.\nNote: This cocktail should be freshly prepared on ice before use.\nMix by pipetting up and down with a cut 200 μL micropipette tip.\nIncubate with constant rotation for 15–18 h at 37°C.\nUsing a 1% agarose gel with Red Safe staining, run 9 μL of the digested DNA at 125 V for 25 min at 21°C–25°C to confirm DNA digestion. The resulting DNA sizes should appear as a smear peaking in intensity at ∼200–500 bp in size (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A; see troubleshooting #3–4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2042-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Representative results related to DRIP experiments employing the LasR system\n(A) Representative agarose gel electrophoresis illustrating typical chromatin fragments obtained following the digestion of DNA with restriction enzymes in preparation for chromatin pulldown experiments.\n(B and C) DRIP analysis shows that using RED (B) or dRED (C) together with sgIGS28 respectively decreased and increased R-loop levels in trans at the spatially proximal IGS18 site. RED results in (B) are shown before (left, %Input) and after (right, %Input/IgG) normalization to IgG signals to control for background variability especially within highly repetitive DNA loci.",
    "(D and E) DRIP analysis shows that using RED (D) or dRED (E) together with sgIGS28 does not alter the levels of R-loops at unrelated genetic loci.\n(F) Schematic summarizing the pools of sgRNAs tested so far with this LasR system protocol when applied in trans at rDNA as shown previously (Abraham et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) and herein or used in cis at the 5′Pause site of the single-copy β-ACTIN locus as shown elsewhere (Khosraviani et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Testing different pools of sgRNAs targeting both DNA strands allowed for the combination of three sgRNAs that specifically target to the locus of interest and enriched the RED and dRED chimaeras in ChIP at the targeted loci. (A–F) HEK293T cells were used; data are shown as mean ± S.D.; two-tailed t-test (A–C) or two-tailed ANOVA with Tuckey’s multiple comparisons test (D and E); N = 3 biologically independent experiments.\nAdd 40 μL of 3 M NaOAc pH 5.2 to the digested DNA.\nAdd 400 μL of phenol-chloroform and mix well.\nCritical: Perform this step under the fume hood.\nCentrifuge at 16,100 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nTransfer 300 μL of the top aqueous phase to a new tube.\nRepeat steps 37–39.\nAdd 2.4 volumes (∼600 μL) of cold 100% EtOH.\nPrecipitate DNA by incubating for 15 min at −20°C.\nCentrifuge at 16,100 × g for 30 min at 4°C to pellet the DNA.\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 mL of cold 70% EtOH.\nCentrifuge at 16,100 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAir dry for 30 min under the fume hood.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 μL of TE.\nMeasure the concentration (OD260) of the DNA using NanoDrop2000 or similar method. The concentration should be ∼400–1,000 ng/μL (see troubleshooting #5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).",
    "Add 4.4 μg of digested DNA for each IP in a new 1.5 mL low retention tube and top-up to a total of 100 μL with nuclease-free ddH2O.\nNote: As an anti-RNA-DNA hybrid specificity control, treatment with recombinant RNase H1 in vitro can be performed by incubating 4.4 μg of digested DNA with 20 μL (100 U) of RNase H1, 10 μL of 10× RNase H1 buffer (supplied with recombinant RNase H1), and topping up to 100 μL with nuclease-free water. Samples can then be incubated for 15–18 h at 37°C before proceeding with the immunoprecipitation (Abraham et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nNote: Perform two independent IPs for each sample by using the S9.6 antibody to pull down DNA-RNA hybrids or anti-IgG as mock pulldown control.\nAdd 350 μL of TE buffer and 50 μL of 10× binding buffer to each sample.\nSet aside 50 μL of each sample to serve as input.\nNote: Note that this is 10% of input, and this information will be used to quantify enrichments as percent input.\nAdd 10 μg of the S9.6 antibody to each IP tube. For the mock IP controls, add 10 μg of the mouse anti-IgG antibody instead.\nRotate for 15–18 h at 4°C.\nPer each IP sample, wash 50 μL of Dynabeads or similar three times with 1 mL of the 1× binding buffer by rotating for 10 min at 21°C–25°C for each wash in a new set of tubes. Pellet the beads on the DynaMagTM-2 Magnet rack or centrifuge if applicable/preferred, and remove the 1× binding buffer.\nNote: Using less than 50 μL of Dynabeads can significantly lower the percent input.\nAdd the antibody-DNA mix from step 52 directly into the tubes prepared in step 54.\nRotate for 2 h at 4°C.\nPellet the beads and discard the supernatant.",
