  "procedures": [
    "Notes: All mouse procedures must be performed according to the animal facility and national guidelines for animal use. Prior to and during the infection period, mice were maintained with autoclaved water and autoclaved balanced feed “ad libidum”. Inoculation of mice with schistosomulaNote: The following procedure is performed using the schistosomula stage (Figure 1). However, mouse inoculation and further procedures can also be performed using the cercariae stage. Calculate the volume of medium containing 350 schistosomula. To calculate the number of parasites/volume, multiply 350 by the total volume of the culture medium and divide this result by the total number of parasites cultivated in that culture medium.Note: The number of schistosomula to be inoculated per mouse can be up to 450 parasites per animal. Include a control group. Pipette the previously calculated volume into a Petri dish or onto microscope slides.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4017/bioprotoc-11-10-4017-g001.jpgFigure 1. Examples of schistosomula cultivated in culture medium. Representative image of a schistosomula culture obtained at 10× magnification.Withdraw a sample to check, under the microscope, whether the pipetted volume contains the expected number of schistosomula.Place the parasites from each group into ten Maxymum Recovery® 0.6-ml microfuge tubes (one tube per mouse). Each microfuge tube should contain 350 schistosomula.Note: In the absence of Maxymum Recovery® microfuge tubes, it is possible to use a sterile microfuge tube instead; however, the use of Maxymum Recovery® microfuge tubes ensures that parasite inoculation will be more homogeneous, since it reduces the number of parasites remaining on the walls of the tube. Make up the volume to 200-300 µl with supplemented GMEM, if necessary.Note: The maximum volume to be inoculated into each mouse is 300 µl. Separate ten female Swiss Webster mice per group.Note: The mouse strain can be changed according to the experimental question.",
    "Use a 1-ml insulin syringe with a 21 G needle for each mouse.Fill the syringe with the schistosomula previously added to the 0.6-ml microfuge tube.Note: Use one syringe and needle per animal to avoid inoculation of a disproportionate number of parasites. Hold the mouse by grasping the skin along its neck.Inoculate the parasites through the subcutaneous route by injection of the respective syringe contents into the loose skin over the neck.Euthanasia and perfusionNotes: Since oviposition starts after 35 days of infection, euthanasia should be performed from 40 days after parasite inoculation. The anesthetics and euthanasia procedures described in this protocol are approved by Brazilian national guidelines following Law 11794/08. The amount and type of sedatives and euthanasia methods should follow the animal use guidelines of each country. Prepare 1.5 L 0.85% NaCl solution per ten animals.Add 2,500 U/L sodium heparin to the 0.85% NaCl solution.Prepare 200 ml 4% buffered formaldehyde solution per ten animals.Prepare a 2.5% sodium thiopental solution.Weigh each mouse.Hold the mouse by grasping the skin along its neck.Using a 1-ml insulin syringe with a 27 G needle, administer 10 mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride and 150 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride through the intraperitoneal route by injection into the thigh muscles directed away from the femur.Wait for the mouse to become anesthetized.Position the mouse with the abdomen facing upward.Using a 1-ml insulin syringe with a 27 G needle, administer 150 mg/kg 2.5% sodium thiopental through the intraperitoneal route by injection into the abdomen toward the head.Press the mouse's feet with tweezers to confirm euthanasia by noting the absence of a movement response.Clean the abdomen with 70-75% ethanol.Note: Perfusion was conducted according to Pellegrino and Siqueira (1956) with some modifications. Using dissecting scissors make an incision along the midline of the abdomen.",
    "Using dissecting scissors, cut the mouse's diaphragm and rib to expose the heart.Using dissecting scissors, cut the portal vein.Place the mouse intestine and portal vein in the 200-ml glass beaker.Insert the needle of the perfusion equipment into the left ventricle.Start the perfusion equipment for adult worm recovery by NaCl injection.Note: All the liquid that comes out of the portal vein must fall into the beaker since it carries adult worms. Stop the perfusion equipment when the liquid from the portal vein becomes clear.Pass the obtained liquid through a 5-mm sieve, which will retain the recovered adult worms.Transfer the recovered adult worms from the sieve to a 6-well plate. To perform this procedure, turn the sieve upside down and place it on the well. Using a plastic Pasteur pipette and 0.85% NaCl, wash the sieve to release all the worms into the well.Cover the adult worms with 0.85% NaCl solution.Remove the mouse intestine and cut it 3-cm downstream from the end of the ileum.Place the ileum on a microscope slide, cover with a 24 × 24 mm coverslip, and press.Place the remaining intestine portion in a a 6-well plate.Remove the mouse liver.Remove the median lobe and place into a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube previously filled with 200 ml 4% buffered formaldehyde.Place the remainder of the liver in a 6-well plate.Repeat this procedure for all animals.Note: Label the containers according to the animal: liver, intestine, and worms, and the microscope slide of the ileum. Assessment of the number of recovered adult wormsPlace the recovered adult worms from each mouse in a Petri dish.Separate the males from the females using a needle or tweezers.Note: To differentiate males from females, the size and color of the parasites should be observed. Male adult worms are clear and female adult worms are longer and darker.",
    "To recognize the male gynecophoric canal and tubercles, which are characteristics absent in the female, it is necessary to use a magnifier light or light microscope. Count the males and females recovered from each mouse.Repeat the procedure for the adult worms recovered from the remaining mice.Analysis of adult worm lengthAfter counting, transfer the female and male adult worms from each mouse to a 1.5-ml microfuge tube filled with 1 ml AFA solution.Note: Adult worms can be maintained in AFA solution for more than a year. Randomly transfer one female and one male recovered from the same mouse to a microscope slide.Stretch the adult worms carefully.Under a Zeiss Microscope Stemi SV 11, take an image of the adult worms.Notes: All images should be taken using the same parameters. Indicative adult worm images for analysis of length are represented in the original research paper: Tavares, N. C., Gava, S. G., Torres, G. P., de Paiva, C. E. S., Moreira, B. P., Lunkes, F. M. N., Montresor, L. C., Caldeira, R. L. and Mourao, M. M.

Repeat the procedure for the adult worms recovered from the remaining mice.Note: The number of adult worms to be analyzed will depend on the total number of adult worms recovered. Perform this procedure using the maximum number of adult worms as possible. Staining adult worms for confocal analysisNote: Adult worms are stained and analyzed according to Neves et al.",
    "(1998 and 2002). Use a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette to remove all the AFA solution (Figure 2A).Fill the 1.5-ml microfuge tube containing the worms with hydrochloric carmine using a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette (Figure 2B).Optional: Adult worms can be transferred to a small Petri dish or another container that enables parasite soaking in the hydrochloric carmine. Note: The volume of hydrochloric carmine added should completely cover the worms. Incubate the worms in hydrochloric carmine for 30 min at room temperature (Figure 2B).Use a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette to remove the excess hydrochloric carmine (Figure 2B).Add 70% ethanol and quickly remove the ethanol using a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette (Figure 2C).Note: This step is important to remove the excess hydrochloric carmine and should be performed quickly to avoid complete removal of hydrochloric carmine. Repeat Step E5 (Figure 2C).Add hydrochloric alcohol and, after a few seconds, remove it using a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette (Figure 2C).Note: This step provides contrast of different organs and must be performed quickly to avoid complete hydrochloric carmine removal. The removal of hydrochloric alcohol should occur when the worms turn from an intense red to a pale red. Add 70% ethanol and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (Figure 2C).Use a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette to remove the 70% ethanol (Figure 2C).Add 80% ethanol and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (Figure 2C).Use a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette to remove the 80% ethanol (Figure 2C).Add 95% ethanol and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (Figure 2C).",
    "Use a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette to remove the 95% ethanol (Figure 2C).Add absolute ethanol and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (Figure 2C).Use a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette to remove the absolute ethanol (Figure 2C).Notes: When pipetting, care should be taken to avoid worm disruption. The added volume of hydrochloric alcohol and the subsequent ethanol washes should always cover the worms. Steps E5-E14 can be performed using a small Petri dish or another container. The stained worms can be soaked in the solutions using a 5-mm sieve. Use a 20-200 µl manual single-channel or a plastic Pasteur pipette to add 1:2 methyl salicylate-Canada balsam solution for at least 24 h. Cover all the worms with the solution and incubate for at least 24 h (Figure 2D and Figure 3A).Note: Adult worms can be maintained in this solution for years. Place the male and female worms separately onto microscope slides (Figure 2E).Cover the adult worms with 1:2 methyl salicylate-Canada balsam solution using a 20 µl-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette (Figure 2E).Carefully cover the microscope slide with a 24 × 24 mm coverslip (Figure 2E).Fill the space between the microscope slide and the coverslip with 1:2 methyl salicylate-Canada balsam solution using a 20-200 µl manual single-channel pipette or a plastic Pasteur pipette (Figure 2E).Place the slides on a flat surface to dry (Figure 3B).Note: The microscope slides should rest on a flat surface to dry for 1-2 months. Observe every day whether more 1:2 methyl salicylate-Canada balsam solution should be added to avoid drying out. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4017/bioprotoc-11-10-4017-g002.jpgFigure 2.
