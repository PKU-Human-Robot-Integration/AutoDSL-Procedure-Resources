    "1. AAV2 random 7-mer peptide display library preparation\nNOTE: For the preparation of an AAV2 random peptide display library, synthesize the degenerate oligonucleotides as single-stranded DNA, convert it to double-stranded DNA, digest, ligate to the acceptor plasmid, and electroporate.\nDesign of degenerate oligonucleotides\n\t\nOrder the degenerate oligonucleotides and avoid codon bias. In the oligonucleotide 5' CAGTCGGCCAG AG W GGC (X01)7 GCCCAGGCGGCTGACGAG 3', X01 corresponds to 20 codons, each encoding one of the 20 amino acids. The W can be A or T, producing the codons AGA or AGT, which encode the amino acids arginine (R) or serine (S).\nOrder the amplification primer: 5' CTCGTCAGCCGCCTGG 3' (see Figure 1 for details). This produces the following protein insert: R/S G X7. The theoretical diversity is calculated as follows: 1 x 2 x 207 = 2.56 x 109 unique variants.\n\t\tNOTE: It should be noted that this diversity might be restricted by the transformation efficiency.\nSecond-strand synthesis\n\t\nResuspend both the oligonucleotides (degenerate oligonucleotides and amplification primer) to a 100 µM final concentration with TE buffer.\n\t\t\nFor the PCR reaction, set up a 50 µL reaction with 1 µL of each primer, 10 µL of the buffer, 1.5 µL of DMSO, 0.5 µL of dNTPs (10 mM), 0.5 µL of Hi-fidelity Hot Start Polymerase II, and 35.5 µL of nuclease-free water.\nTransfer the reaction to a thermocycler and run a pre-incubation step for 10 s at 98 °C, followed by three cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 59 °C, and 10 s at 72 °C, then 5 min at 72 °C and a final cooling step.\nPurify the reaction using a nucleotide removal kit and elute in 100 µL of nuclease-free water.",
    "Confirm the efficiency of the second-strand synthesis by analysis on a Bioanalyzer (see Figure 2). Analyze the size and purity of the double-stranded insert by loading 1 µL of the reaction to a microfluidic chip from a DNA 1000 Reagents kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. This kit is optimized to measure the size and concentration of double-stranded DNA fragments from 25-1,000 bps.\nDigestion of insert and plasmid vector\n\t\nDigest 85 µL of the purified insert with 10 µL of 10x buffer and 5 µL of BglI enzyme in a final 100 µL reaction volume (see Figure 1 for details). Incubate at 37 °C overnight. Purify using a nucleotide removal kit, elute in 50 µL of nuclease-free water, and quantify using the type \"Oligo DNA\" in a spectrophotometer.\nDigest 10 µg of a replication-competent AAV plasmid (pRep2Cap2_PIS)26 (ITR-flanked viral genome) with 20 µL of 10x buffer and 10 µL of SfiI enzyme in a final 200 µL reaction volume (see Figure 1 for details). Incubate at 50 °C overnight. Purify the vector on a 1% agarose gel using the gel extraction kit followed by an additional purification step using a DNA purifying kit. Quantify the concentration in a spectrophotometer.\nLigation of insert to vector\n\t\nLigate 955 ng of plasmid vector with 45 ng of insert with 2 µL of buffer and 2 µL of ligase in a 20 µL ligation reaction. Incubate at 16 °C overnight, followed by 10 min at 70 °C to heat-inactivate the ligase.\nTransformation, complexity calculation, and plasmid library preparation\n\t\nPurify the reaction with a DNA purifying kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Elute the reaction in about 80% of the starting volume of nuclease-free water and store on ice for subsequent transformation.",
    "Transform electrocompetent cells: thaw one vial of electrocompetent cells on ice for 10 min. Then add 1-2 µL of the purified ligation reaction to 30 µL (one vial) of electrocompetent cells and mix by gently tapping. Next, carefully pipette the cell/DNA mixture to a pre-chilled 1 mm gap electroporation cuvette without introducing air bubbles.\nElectroporate using the following settings: 1800 V, 600 Ω, and 10 µF. Within 10 s of the electroporation pulse, add 970 µL of pre-warmed recovery media (provided with the electrocompetent cells) to the cuvette and mix by pipetting. Lastly, transfer the cells to a micro centrifuge tube and incubate for 1 h at 37 °C at 250 rpm. To achieve a desired diversity, perform 10-100 reactions, and after incubation, pool all reactions in one tube.\nCalculate the diversity by diluting 10 µL of the pooled transformations 10-, 100-, or 1,000-fold in PBS and spread 100 µL on nutrient agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic (75 mg/mL of ampicillin). Incubate the agar plates overnight at 37 °C and then count the colonies on the agar plates.\nCalculate the theoretical diversity as follows:\n\t\tTheoretical maximal diversity = 10 x dilution factor x number of colonies x number of electroporation reactions.\n\t\t​NOTE: To confirm the library quality, sequence at least 20 colonies by Sanger sequencing. Most clones should contain an insert, and all should be unique.\nInoculate 400-1,000 mL of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic with the rest of the pooled transformations and incubate overnight at 37 °C, 180 rpm.\nPreparation of plasmid library\n\t\nFrom the overnight culture, prepare a glycerol stock (mix equal volumes of bacterial culture and 50% glycerol solution in nuclease-free water and freeze at -80 °C) and purify the plasmid library using a plasmid maxi kit.\nProduction of AAV viral library",
    "Prepare the viral library as previously described27. Transfect the plasmid library (pRep2Cap2_PI, peptide insert) together with an adeno-helper plasmid to HEK293T cells using a transfection reagent such as polyethylenimine (PEI).\nCollect the cells after 3 days and subject them to three cycles of freeze-thaw. Purify the viral lysate using cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation, followed by buffer exchange to PBS, and finally concentrate the viral particles.\nAAV vector titration using dd-PCR\n\t\nSerially dilute 2 µL of the AAV vector stock in 198 µL of nuclease-free water to yield a 1:106 final dilution. Mix thoroughly each time using a 200 µL pipette. Add one no-template control (NTC) as a negative control.\n\t\tNOTE: Additional lower or higher dilutions may be assayed (1:105-1:107).\nPrepare a 20x primer-probe mix. Add 3.6 µL of each of the 100 µM primers (forward and reverse, Rep2, and ITR), 1 µL each of the 100 µM dd-PCR probes (Rep2 and ITR), and 3.6 µL of nuclease-free water to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The AAV library is measured using a transgene-targeted primer-probe set (Rep2) detected with a FAM-labeled probe, and an ITR-targeted primer-probe set detected with a HEX-labeled probe.\nPrepare a 22 µL PCR reaction by adding 5.5 µL of sample, 1.1 µL of 20x primer-probe mix, 11 µL of dd-PCR supermix for probes (no dUTP), and 4.4 µL of nuclease-free water. This yields concentrations of 900 nM and 250 nM for the primers and the probe, respectively.",
    "Generate the droplets using a droplet generator, transfer the reaction to a 96-well plate, place the plate into a thermocycler, and run a denaturation step for 10 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 58 °C. Next, heat-inactivate the polymerase for 10 min at 98 °C and add a final cooling step. Read the reactions in a droplet reader and proceed to the analysis28.\nOpen the saved dd-PCR plate file using the analysis software. Use the threshold tool in the 1D Amplitude tab (fluorescence amplitude vs. event number) to separate the negative and positive droplets for each channel, using the NTC as a guide, and export the data to a csv file.\nTo calculate the vector concentration, first calculate the correction factor CF using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64389/64389eq01.jpg\nCF determines the proportion of droplets positive for the transgene [Positives] that are positive for both, transgene and ITR [Ch1+ Ch2+], to ensure the detection of functional vector particles. The final vector concentration c can now be calculated using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64389/64389eq02.jpg\n\t\tDF is the dilution factor (1:105-1:107 as determined earlier). The copies per 20 µL/well reaction correspond to 5 µL of the diluted sample. The factor 1,000 corrects the scale to VG/mL (viral genome/mL). An exemplary titration result is demonstrated in Table 1 and Figure 3.\nAnalysis of the AAV viral library by NGS\n\t\nAmplify the 96-nucleotide peptide insertion fragment by setting up a 20 µL PCR reaction using a proof-reading polymerase kit (2x; see Figure 4). Add 1 µL of AAV stock containing 1 x 108 vg, 0.5 µL of each of 100 µM primer (NGS_forward and NGS_reverse), and 10 µL of the enzyme mix to the reaction. Adjust the final volume to 20 µL with nuclease-free water.",
    "Transfer the reaction to a thermocycler and run a denaturation step for 3 min at 98 °C, followed by 30-35 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 10 s at 59 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C, followed by 5 min at 72 °C and a final cooling step.\nPurify the samples using a PCR purification kit. Quantify the concentration in a spectrophotometer and run a 3% agarose gel to verify purity and fragment size.\nProcess the PCR fragments using the library system for low complexity samples kit according to the manufacturer's instructions for the preparation of an NGS library. Perform the end repair reaction with 30 ng of PCR fragment, followed by adaptor ligation and PCR amplification for 10 cycles. Use the PCR purification kit for the purification of the reactions.\nProcess the final products on a Bioanalyzer to verify the size and purity, using a DNA reagents kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nQuantify the amplicons using a fluorometer and pool them. Quantify the final pooled NGS library again on a fluorometer (according to the manufacturer's instructions) and verify the quality on a Bioanalyzer.\nSequence the NGS libraries in a single-end (SE) mode, using a 75-cycle high output kit, with a read length of 84 and an index 1 of 8.\n\t\tNOTE: Sequencing of the examples in this article was performed at the GeneCore facility of EMBL Heidelberg (http://www.genecore.embl.de/).\nAnalyze the NGS sequencing data with Python 3 and biopython. The files can be found at https://github.com/grimmlabs/AAV_GrimmLab_JoVE2022 (alternatively at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7032215). The NGS analysis is composed of two steps.",
    "In the first step, search the sequence files for sequences that satisfy certain criteria (presence of recognition sequences flanking the insertion site) (see Figure 4, step 1.9.8.5.). This is done using a script (Script#1) and a configuration file that provides the information needed. Once the correct sequence is identified, the program extracts and stores the sequence in the output file, which is a txt file with the same name as the sequencing file.\nThe second step is the analysis of the output files. The sequences in the library start with any of six nucleotides (AGWggc, W =A/T) in the nine amino-acid insert. Based on this start sequence, the peptide is translated. This generates the output files that contain the peptide variants (PVs).\nPrepare two folders: Script and Data. To the Data folder, copy the gzip-compressed files resulting from the sequencing. To the Script folder, copy the following files, Python file: Script#1_DetectionExtraction_JoVE_Py3.py; Python file: Script#2_PV_extraction_and_ranking_Py3.py; Configuration file: Barcode_Script_JoVE.conf; and Look-up table (LUT) file: Zuordnung.txt.\nBefore running the scripts, edit the following files in the Script folder. Open the \"Zuordnung.txt\" file and add in two tab-separated columns, the names of the gzip files (column 1), and the desired final name (column 2; tab-separated values).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Sample txt files are found in the GitHub folder \"PV_analysis_script\". The files provided in the GitHub folder are prepared for the analysis of three sample data from the above library: xaa.txt.gz, xab.txt.gz, and xac.txt.gz. The output files are also provided.\nChange the following variables in the configuration file \"Barcode_Script_JoVE.conf\":\nmy_dir = \"~/Data/\"\nfilename_sample_file = \"~/Script/Zuordnung.txt\"\n\t\t\tThe sequence-specific variables: BCV_size = 27, BCVleft = TCCAGGGCCAG, BCVright = GCCCAGG, BCVloc = 30, BCVmargin = 8, BCVleft_revcomp = GCCGCCTGGGC, BCVright_revcomp = CTGGCCC, and BCVloc_revcomp = 41 (see Figure 4 for details).",
    "Use the following command to call the variant sequence detection and extraction:\n>python3 ~/Script#1_DetectionExtraction_JoVE_Py3.py ~/Barcode_Script_JoVE.conf\n\t\t\tNOTE: The output are txt files with the extracted DNA sequences and their numbers of reads. The header of this file contains statistical data (i.e., the total number of reads and the extracted reads). These data are transferred to the next files. These txt data are the input files for Script#2, in which the DNA sequences are translated, ranked, and analyzed.\nPerform PV extraction and analysis using the following command:\n>python3 ~/Script#2_PV_extraction_and_ranking_Py3.py ~/Barcode_Script_JoVE.conf\nAnalyze the text output files of Script#2. The output files of Script#2 are named using the second column of the LUT in \"Zuordnung.txt\" with extensions based on the type of analysis.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Ensure that the three output files contain statistical data in the first rows (\"# of Valid PV reads\", \"# of Invalid PV reads\", and \"# of unique PV reads\"), a first column with the index of each DNA sequence from the input txt files (output of Script#1), and the following columns: (1) \"…analyzed_all.csv\": \"Sample:\" (DNA sequence), \"#\" (number of reads), \"Frw or Rev\" (forward or reverse read), and \"PVs\" (translated peptide sequence). The invalid sequences have \"NA\" and \"not valid\" in the last two columns. (2) \"…analyzed_validSeq.csv\": same as the previous file, filtered for valid sequences. (3) \"…analyzed_PV.csv\": \"PVs\" (translated peptide sequence), \"#\" (number of reads), and \"count\" (the frw and rev counts in the previous files are merged and the count is given 1 or 2).\nVisualize the output files using available software based on the user's needs.\n2. AAV2 random 7-mer peptide display library selection\nUse the AAV library after quantification and quality-control (section 1) for directed evolution in a model of choice to iteratively select for candidates with desired properties (See Figure 5)16,18,21.",
    "​NOTE: These candidates are then used for the generation of a barcoded library as described below in section 3.\n3. Barcoded AAV capsid library preparation and analysis\nNOTE: Following the identification of a set of potentially specific and efficient AAV capsids in the peptide display screen, verify the functionality of the identified peptide sequences and compare them with a set of commonly used or well-described reference AAV capsid variants. To do this, the capsid sequence is inserted into a Rep/Cap helper construct without ITRs.\nProduction of barcoded AAV library\n\t\nPerform recombinant AAV production for each capsid variant using the three-plasmid system, as previously described24.\n\t\tNOTE: To distinguish the different capsid variants, the ITR-flanked reporter transgene plasmid harbors a unique barcode of 15 nucleotides in length. The barcode is located at the 3' UTR (untranslated region) between the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) and the polyA signal (see Figure 6A). EYFP expression is driven by a strong ubiquitous cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter that provides sufficient levels of RNA transcripts.\nDesign barcodes of 15 nucleotides in length with homopolymers of less than three nucleotides, GC content of <65%29, and a Hamming distance greater than four nucleotides24.\nProduce each capsid separately in combination with a transgene plasmid carrying a unique barcode. This way, each capsid variant is tagged with a distinct barcode that enables its specific tracking (see Figure 6B).\nAAV vector titration using dd-PCR\n\t\nPerform the AAV titration as previously described in section 1.8, by replacing the Rep2 primer pair with the YFP primer pair.\nQuantify the individual AAV productions and pool equal amounts of each production to generate the final barcoded library.\nQuantify the final library again to check the final concentration and quality (see Figure 7).\nBarcoded AAV library in vivo application",
    "Apply the barcoded AAV library systemically to the model system of choice (e.g. systemically in mice24).\nCollect ON- and OFF-target tissues (i.e., liver, lung, heart, diaphragm, smooth muscle, duodenum, pancreas, colon, biceps, ovaries, stomach, inner ear, kidney, abdominal aorta, thoracic aorta, brain, brown and white fat, and spleen) or cell types based on the experiment. Freeze them at -80 °C, extract the DNA/RNA, and apply NGS quantitation analysis, as described in the next section.\nDNA/RNA extraction\n\t\nExtract the DNA and RNA from the tissues of interest using the DNA/RNA Mini Kit.\nPlace a small piece of the tissue of interest (1 mm3, about 5 mg) in a 2 mL reaction tube.\nAdd 350 µL of lysis buffer mixed with β-mercaptoethanol (1%) and 5 mm steel beads to the tissue (handle samples with β-mercaptoethanol under a fume hood).\nHomogenize the tissue in a tissueLyser for 45 s at 40 Hz.\nAdd 10 µL of proteinase K (10 mg/mL) and incubate for 15 min at 55 °C while shaking at 400 rpm.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 x g for 3 min at room temperature, collect the supernatant, and proceed with the manufacturer's protocol of the DNA/RNA Kit.\nSplit the washing step into two steps with 350 µL of wash buffer in each step. In between these washing steps, digest the remnant DNA on the column with RNase-free DNase I. Add 80 µL of the DNase I solution, prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction, onto the column and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nElute RNA/DNA from the column with nuclease-free water. Store the isolated RNA at -80 °C and the gDNA at -20 °C.\ncDNA synthesis",
    "Subject the RNA samples to another round of DNase I treatment of 15-30 min (for complete removal of contaminating DNA from the RNA samples) before the reverse-transcription reaction. Add 1 µL of the DNase I solution, 4 µL of buffer (provided with the kit), and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 40 µL to 212 ng of RNA. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature and heat inactivate at 70 °C for 10 min.\nSynthesize cDNA, using 150 ng of RNA using a kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Include controls without the reverse transcriptase, to ensure the absence of contaminating viral DNA from the sample. The cDNA is stored at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of input RNA for optimal reverse transcription can vary depending on the tissue type and the expected transduction efficiency in the respective tissue.\nAnalysis of AAV viral library (in-vivo) by NGS\n\t\nTo achieve high sequencing depth at low cost, perform NGS via Illumina sequencing as previously described (section 1.9). Amplify the barcode sequence, and then ligate the sequencing adaptors to the amplicon.\nDue to the short-read length and the ligation of the sequencing adapters on both sides of the amplicon, when designing, check that the amplicon is sufficiently small to ensure presence of the barcode sequence within the NGS read. For the sequencing of the barcodes within the viral genomes and the viral transcripts, the PCR amplicon is designed to be 113 bp long (see Figure 8).",
    "Amplify the barcoded region with the primers BC-seq forward and BC-seq reverse. Prepare the following PCR reaction: 0.5 µL of Hi-fidelity DNA polymerase, 10 µL of 5x buffer, 0.25 µL of each 100 µM primer (BC-seq fw/BC-seq rv), and 1 µl of 10 mM dNTPs. Use 25 ng of the cDNA or DNA/reaction as a template and adjust the final volume to 50 µL with nuclease-free water.\nPrepare the PCR master-mix under a clean PCR hood to avoid contamination. Use the following cycling conditions: 30 s at 98 °C, followed by 40 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 20 s, and a final 5 min step at 72 °C.\nInclude PCR controls to confirm the absence of contaminating DNA in the PCR master-mix. For the cDNA samples, include the controls without reverse transcriptase. Finally, include a sample with the AAV input library. This information will be used to generate the Normalization_Variant.txt file used in the analysis.\nVerify the size of the PCR fragment of each sample by gel electrophoresis before PCR purification. The latter is achieved by using either commercially available magnetic beads or column-based DNA purification systems (see Table of Materials).\nPrepare the NGS library using the library system for low complexity samples according to the manufacturer's instructions, as previously described in section 1.9.\nDetermine the DNA concentration via the dsDNA HS Kit and analyze the quality of the library as previously described (section 1.9.6), followed by pooling. Quantify the pooled library on a fluorometer and assess the quality on a Bioanalyzer.\nPerform NGS sequencing as discussed in section 1.9.7.\nQuantify by qPCR the copy number of the transgene (viral genomes) and the housekeeping gene to assess the distribution of the pooled library between tissues or organs on the DNA.",
    "Set up a 30 µL qPCR reaction as follows, to determine the copy number of EYFP (transgene) and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, housekeeping gene):\n\t\t\nPrepare a 60x primer/probe mix for EYFP (1.5 µM YFP_fw, 1.5 µM YFP_rv, and 0.6 µM YFP_probe; see Table of Materials). Use GAPDH primer/probe mix (see Table of Materials) to determine the copy number of the housekeeper gene. Set up the reaction on ice.\nPrepare a PCR master mix (15 µL, see Table of Materials) and add 60x primer/probe mix (0.5 µL) for all samples and standards (to calculate copy numbers for the standards, use the following link: http://cels.uri.edu/gsc/cndna.html). Set up the reaction on ice.\nTransfer 15.5 µL of the master mix into a 96-well plate and add 14.5 µL of sample (75 ng of total DNA concentration) or standard to the respective well. Seal the 96-well plate with foil, vortex, and spin briefly.\nTransfer 10 µL of each sample into a 384-well plate in duplicates. Seal the plate with foil and spin at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nIncubate the reaction mix in a thermocycler using an initial temperature of 50 °C for 2 min, followed by an initial activation step of 10 min at 95 °C. Perform 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min24.\nTo obtain the number of diploid genomes (dg), use the GAPDH copy number and divide by two. Then, take the value of the EYFP copy number and divide by the number of dg, resulting in vector genomes per diploid genome (vg/dg). Use this value to generate the Normalization_Organ.txt file for the bioinformatic analysis.",
    "Perform the analysis of the NGS sequencing data like Weinmann et al.24, using custom code in Python3 (https://github.com/grimmlabs/AAV_GrimmLab_JoVE2022). The workflow comprises the detection of barcode sequences guided by flanking sequences, their length and location (Script#1_BarcodeDetection.py), as well as analysis of barcode enrichment and distribution over the set of tissues (Script#2_BarcodeAnalysis.py).\n\t\t\nDetect barcode and assign them to AAV variants.
