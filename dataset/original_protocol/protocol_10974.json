    "Human pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) samples were acquired according to an IRB-approved protocol in our laboratory. Informed consent was obtained from patients for tissue collection. Tissue was transported from the operating room to the laboratory and then processed as follows.\n1. Tissue dissociation (digestion)\nPrepare Digest Buffer (see Table of Materials).\nObtain the tissue of interest as soon as possible after tumor excision and transport the specimen in quench buffer (DMEM F-12 with ~5% fetal bovine serum) or 1x PBS on ice.\nMince the tissue using clean forceps and scissors in 3-5 mL of Digest Buffer in a 90 mm Petri dish (Figure 2A).\nTransfer the minced tissue to a 50 mL conical tube and dissociate in ~10 mL of Digest Buffer for 30 min at 37 °C using a water bath with shaking function or a dry agitator.\nRemove from the agitator and quench with ~20 mL of quench medium. Filter the solution through a 100 µm cell strainer into a clean conical tube.\nCollect any remaining solid tissue from the strainer (re-mince remaining tissue pieces if needed), and place in ~10 mL of fresh Digest Buffer for another 30 min at 37 °C with agitation. Repeat until all tumor tissue has been dissociated.\nPool cell suspension aliquots and filter through a 70 µm followed by a 40 µm cell strainer into a clean conical tube on ice.\nCentrifuge to pellet cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then decant the supernatant.\n2. Cryopreservation\nRinse the cells by resuspending the pellet in 1 mL of 1x PBS.\nTransfer the cell suspension (~1-10 million cells/tube for optimal freezing) to a 1.5 mL cryovial on ice.\nCentrifuge to pellet cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then decant the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 1 mL of Bambanker solution, transfer to a 1.5 or 2 mL cryovial (Figure 2B), and freeze using a -1 °C/min cooling rate freezing container (containing 100% isopropyl alcohol) at -80 °C, or transfer to liquid nitrogen if longer-term storage of the sample is anticipated.\n3. Nuclei isolation\nRapidly thaw the cryovial of cell suspension and place it on wet ice.\nTransfer the thawed cell suspension to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and top up the vial to 2 mL solution with 1x PBS to rinse the cells.\nObtain a manual cell count using a hemocytometer to assess both the quantity and quality of the cells (Figure 2C).\nCentrifuge to pellet cells at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then gently decant the supernatant using progressively smaller pipette tips to leave behind a dry pellet and maintain it on ice.\n\t\nUse a swing-bucket rotor for all centrifugation steps. For maximum cell yield, place the tubes in the centrifuge with the hinge facing outwards and then decant with the pipette tip directed towards the opposite side of the tube (Figure 2D).\n\t\tNOTE: For decanting the supernatant, use progressively smaller pipette tips to remove fluid to limit disruption of the pellet while maximizing the volume of fluid decanted. This strategy is particularly helpful later in the protocol following nuclei extraction since the nuclei pellet is generally not visible.\nPrepare 1x Cell Lysis Buffer, Cell Lysis Dilution Buffer, and Wash Buffer (Figure 3A) according to the published protocol with the following modifications (see Table 1, Table of Materials):\n\tNOTE: Place the Digitonin on a heating block at 65 °C prior to use to dissolve the precipitate (Figure 3B). This typically takes about 10 min.",
    "Prepare the 0.1x Cell Lysis Buffer by combining 100 µL of 1x Cell Lysis Buffer and 900 µL of Cell Lysis Dilution Buffer, pipette gently to mix, and place it on ice.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 100 µL of chilled 0.1x Cell Lysis Buffer and gently pipette to mix 5x.\nIncubate on ice for 3 min (Figure 3C).\nAdd 1 mL of chilled Wash Buffer and pipette up and down to gently mix 5x.\nCentrifuge to pellet the nuclei at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, gently decant the supernatant to a dry pellet, and maintain on ice.\n\tNOTE: If the starting cell number is low (100,000-200,000 cells), perform the cell lysis and wash steps in a 200 µL PCR tube instead of a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube to decrease the tube surface area and minimize losses. In this case, adjust the Wash Buffer volume down to accommodate the smaller tube volume.\nRepeat Steps 3.9-3.10 2x for a total of three washes.\nManually count the nuclei using a hemocytometer slide under the microscope. Use trypan blue dye if desired to provide contrast for viewing the nuclei and to help discern nuclei from unlysed cells.\nPrepare the 1x Nuclei Buffer per the published protocol: 20x Nuclei Buffer stock, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µL RNase Inhibitor in nuclease-free water and keep on ice (see Table of Materials).\nResuspend the nuclei pellet in 1x Nuclei Buffer based on goal-targeted nuclei recovery.\n\tNOTE: If the concentration is high enough, aim for a targeted recovery of 10,000 or slightly higher at this step (3,230-8,060 nuclei/µL) when determining the starting resuspension volume, given the anticipated volume loss of 25 µL and the 20% decrease in concentration with filtering (Step 3.15).",
    "Gently pass the resuspended nuclei volume through a 40 µm Pipette Tip Cell Strainer and place the nuclei on ice (Figure 3D).\nRecount the nuclei (Figure 4A-C). Dilute the final solution further with Nuclei Buffer if needed.\nTransport the nuclei on ice and immediately proceed with nuclei capture per published protocols.\nSubscription Required.
