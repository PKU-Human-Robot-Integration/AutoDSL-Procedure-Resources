    "NOTE: The protocol here described follows the guidelines of the French “Comité Consultatif National d’Ethique” and is declared as a collection activity by INSERM.\n1. Resection of Human Epileptic Tissue\nPatients\n\t\nObtain brain tissue from patients suffering from intractable epilepsy. Obtain a written informed consent before surgery.\nFor all operated epileptic patients perform an extensive presurgical workup including neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, surface EEG, and neuroimaging (MRI and sometimes 18FDG-PET scan; Figure 1A), followed by post-surgical histological examination of resected tissue (Figure 1B). NOTE: Surgery is indicated when the diverse explorations localize similarly the seizure onset zone and when the benefit of its removal exceeds the surgical risks.\nSurgery\n\t\nMaintain antiepileptic drugs pre-operatively. Perform surgery under general anesthesia: induction with inhaled sevoflurane (6% delivered ratio and 100% inhaled fraction of O2), intra venous sufentanyl (0.3 µg/kg) and antracurium (0.5 mg/kg), followed by maintenance with intra venous sufentanyl (0.5 µg/kg/hr) and inhaled sevoflurane (1 MAC).\nUse a neuronavigation system to allow a precise localization of the lesioned cortex (Figure 1C). After skin incision, perform a burr hole in the bone followed by a craniotomy with a high spill drill. Gently elevate the bone flap, and open the dura with scissors (Figure 1D).\nUse intra-operative ultra sound to facilitate the identification of the abnormal cortex, and microsurgical instruments and an ultrasonic aspirator under the operating microscope.\nCoagulate and cut the pio-arachnoidal plane according to the sulcal limits. Use subpial dissection to release the cortex from the pia around the lesioned area.\nCut the white matter under the abnormal cortex to perform one piece “en bloc” resection, sparing as much as possible the vasculature. Avoid traumatic manipulation of the cortex.",
    "Cut a 1 cm thick slice out of the resected tissue along a direction orthogonal to the pial surface, including the sulcus bottom and transitional cortex.\n2. Artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid (ACSF) for Slice Preparation, Incubation and Recording\nACSF for slice preparation\n\t\nPrepare 1 L of sucrose-based ACSF7,8, containing (in mM): 250 sucrose, 3 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 10 D-Glucose, 1 CaCl2, 10 MgCl2; dissolve these salts in deionized water and oxygenate the solution with carbogen for at least 10 min.\nPut ~700 ml of sucrose ACSF at -80 °C for 50-60 min (or -150 °C for 15-20 min). Keep the rest of the solution under oxygenation in ice. NOTE: The ACSF for slice preparation can be stored at 4 °C; in this case, add CaCl2 and MgCl2 the day of the experiment, before cooling it.\nACSF for slice incubation and recording\n\t\nPrepare at least 3 L of recording ACSF7,8, containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 10 D-Glucose, 1.6 CaCl2, 1.3 MgCl2; dissolve these salts in deionized water and oxygenate the solution with carbogen. Before adding MgCl2, keep some ACSF to perform recordings in 0 Mg2+ ACSF. NOTE: The incubation/recording ACSF can be stored at 4 °C; in this case, add CaCl2 and MgCl2 the day of the experiment.\n3. Equipment for Slice Incubation and Recording\nInterface chamber for slice incubation\n\t\nUse a brain slice chamber to maintain living slices ex vivo in interface mode. NOTE: The chamber is composed of a lower section, which contains the heating and the sensor elements and a ceramic bubbler and is filled with distilled water, and an upper part, where the slices rest on a sheet of lens tissue in the flat area in the center of the chamber (Figure 2A-B).",
    "Use two separate fine PTFE tubes, through which the preoxygenated ACSF enters the chamber. NOTE: The tubes spiral in the heated water and reach the upper part of the chamber; then the solution exits by means of capillary action with lens tissue, that conveys the solution into exit wells.\nConnect the PTFE tubes of the interface chamber to a peristaltic pump, to allow continuous perfusion of the slices with the preoxygenated medium.\nMaintain the high oxygen tension by oxygenating with carbogen (95% O2 and 5% CO2) through the ceramic bubbler. NOTE: This warmed and moistened gas mixture reaches the slices in the upper part of the chamber through appropriate holes.\nMaintain the temperature in the upper part of the chamber by connecting the chamber to a temperature controller, through a special double-ended cable, having a connector for the chamber heating element and an external temperature sensor at one end. Place the sensor near the slices to check the temperature throughout the incubation (Figure 2C).\nMulti-electrode array recordings\n\t\nUse planar multi-electrode arrays with 120 titanium nitride electrodes (30 µm diameter) insulated with silicon nitride and internal reference electrode, arranged in a 12 x 12 matrix with 200 µm center-to-center spacing. NOTE: Other configurations with different electrode diameter and spacing are possible. In particular, the MEA chip can be widened to sample larger slices of human tissues.\nAcquire electrical signals at 10 kHz using a MEA2100-120 system (pre- and filter amplifier with integrated data acquisition and analog-digital converter, 16 bit data resolution, input voltage range and bandwidth adjustable via software) through a dedicated software (MC_Rack). NOTE: The MEA2100 headstage is endowed of a metal plate for fixing of heatable perfusion element through magnetic holders, to continuously perfuse the slices throughout the recording session.",
    "Hold the tissue down on the MEA by a small homemade platinum anchor, which ensures a good electrical coupling between the slice and the electrodes.\n4. Preparation of Interface Chamber and Tools for Dissection and Slicing\nInterface chamber\n\t\nFill the lower section of the interface chamber with distilled water. Ensure that the level of water completely immerses the heating element and is 2 to 4 mm below the junction between the lower and upper section of the chamber. Check this level daily before switching on the heating, in order to avoid damage of the heating element.\nConnect the chamber to a carbogen source, endowed with a secondary flow regulator for fine adjustments of gas pressure.\nCut a sheet of lens tissue in order to fit the flat area of the slice chamber, and position it close to input solution tubes, to let any bubble escape from the input line before reaching the slices.\nCut two pieces of stranded cotton thread as long as the piece of lens tissue, and position them along the main sides of the flat area of the chamber. NOTE: This helps to slightly raise the perfusion solution level in the chamber.\nSet the flow rate of the peristaltic pump at 1 ml/min and activate the pump.\nStart oxygenation of the water in the bottom part of the chamber.\nSet the temperature of the temperature controller at 37 °C and turn it on. Cover the upper part of the interface chamber with a piece of parafilm and wait at least 30 min for the temperature to increase and stabilize.\nTools for dissection and slicing\n\t\nPrepare a dissection kit consisting of two fine forceps, a spatula, a small spoon and a blade; two glass petri dishes, two brushes as well as cyanoacrylate glue.",
    "Set the parameters of the vibratome: thickness, 400 µm; frequency, 70 - 90 Hz; amplitude, 0.9 - 1 mm, speed: 0.1 mm/sec.\n5. Human Cortical Slice Preparation\nRemove the sucrose-based ACSF from -80 °C freezer and mix it in order to obtain a sort of slush. Oxygenate it with carbogen, put ~250 ml in a glass bottle and keep it in a Dewar bottle filled with ice, while going to the surgery room of the hospital to get the tissue. In the meantime, keep the rest at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: During the surgery, the neurosurgeon dissects a small block of cortical tissue. Immediately place the sample in ice-cold sucrose ACSF for transfer to the laboratory.\nKeep the time needed for the transfer from the hospital to the laboratory to a maximum of 30 min. In the laboratory, take the sucrose-based oxygenated ACSF out of -20 °C freezer, mix it to have a slush, fill a petri dish and the vibratome buffer tray and start oxygenating both with carbogen. Carefully take out the piece of human tissue from the bottle with a spoon and put it in the petri dish (Figure 2D).\nUsing the forceps, carefully remove blood clots, vessels and meninges to avoid resistance during slicing. Remove the meninges, consisting in pia-matter, starting from the sides of the tissue block, paying attention not to damage the cortical surface. With a blade, cut a side of the tissue to obtain a flat surface, which will be glued on the vibratome specimen plate. NOTE: The meninges, consisting in pia-matter, are removed starting from the sides of the tissue block, paying attention not to damage the cortical surface.",
    "If the block of tissue is bigger than the MEA chamber, cut a piece of appropriate dimensions before gluing it on the specimen plate (Figure 2E).\nGlue the tissue in order to obtain transverse cortical slices, put it into the buffer tray and cut 400 µm thick slices at low speed (0.1 mm/sec) (Figure 2F).\nCut pieces of lens tissue with slice dimensions; with a spatula and a brush, transfer the slices on these lens tissues and incubate them in the interface chamber at 37 °C for at least 1 hr before starting recordings (Figure 2G-I). Continuously store the slices in the same conditions until use. NOTE: Placing slices on lens paper is an important step to facilitate both the perfusion of bottom side of slices and the removal of slices from the interface chamber before recording.\n\t\nWhile transferring the slices on the lens tissue, manage them very carefully, avoiding to touch the cortical layer area with the brush.\nPrepare the slices one at a time and immediately transfer each of them to the interface chamber, in order to ensure proper oxygen supply and temperature; slice the block of resected tissue as quickly as possible.\n6. Preparation of MEA Setup for Recordings\nPlug the perfusion system to a peristaltic pump and the MEA system to a computer. Oxygenate the recording ACSF. Place an empty MEA chip inside the amplifier.\nSet the temperature controller for heating cannula element to reach 37 °C in the MEA chamber and start the perfusion at 5-6 ml/min. NOTE: It is usually necessary to set the temperature 3-4 °C higher than the one desired, depending on the room temperature and the flow rate.",
    "Check the temperature in the MEA chamber with a fine thermometer, placing it the closest possible to the center, without touching the electrode area.\nStart recording software and check that all the MEA electrodes are well connected and that there is no noise due to perfusion.\nStart MEA_Monitor to check the functioning of the camera table.\n7. Transfer of a Slice From Interface Chamber to MEA Chip for Recording\nPour some warmed recording ACSF in a glass Petri dish; with a forceps, take a slice from the interface chamber, by grabbing it through the lens tissue, and put it in the petri dish. Carefully detach the slice from the tissue. If the level of the solution in the interface chamber is carefully adjusted during incubation time, the slice will detach from the lens tissue only by submerging it in the solution; otherwise, use a small brush to facilitate the detachment.\nFill a MEA chip with some ACSF and with a spatula, transfer the slice into it. With a plastic Pasteur pipette, gently remove the solution to make the slice adhere on the electrode area and keep it in place with a platinum anchor. Add 1 ml of recording ACSF, place the MEA chip into the amplifier and start perfusion at 5-6 ml/min (Figure 2J-L).\nCheck the slice position on the MEA recording area by using MEA_Monitor, adjust it if necessary in order to record from the cortical layers and take a picture. Start the recording."
