    "This protocol follows the guidelines of Chalmers University's human research ethics committee.\nNOTE: All steps are to be performed within a sterile biosafety cabinet.\n1. Preparation of Consumables, Bioink, and Cells\nObtain two syringes, one syringe (Figure 1a) is for the cell suspension, while the other syringe is for the bioink (Figure 1b).\nObtain a sterile passive mixing unit (Figure 1c) that can be coupled with dual syringes via a Luer lock connection.\nObtain a dispensing unit (Figure 1d) that can extrude a volume from two sterile syringes simultaneously at a controlled rate.\n\tNOTE: The mixing ratio utilized in this study is 10:1. Therefore, use a 12 mL syringe and a 1 mL syringe as required by the 10:1 mixing unit.\nObtain a sterile cartridge (Figure 1e) and a sterile female-female Luer lock connector to directly mixed the bioink and cell suspension into.\nObtain or prepare the bioink for blending with a cell suspension.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, a nanocellulose/alginate based bioink was utilized. This bioink is cross-linked through the addition of a sterile 100 mM CaCl2 solution post printing.\nDetach cells using a 0.5% trypsin/EDTA solution and count the total number of cells using the trypan blue exclusion method17.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, human fibroblasts were utilized.\nDetermine what cell density is desired in the final printed construct. Calculate using the following equations the concentration of the harvested cells that must be diluted to achieve this target final cell density.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, a final cell density of 5 x 106 cells/mL was utilized.\n\t\nSelect a desired cell concentration for the experiments: Ccell (cells/mL).\nCalculate the amount of bioink necessary, Vbioink, based on the total number of constructs desired:\nVbioink = Vconstruct × NContructs",
    "Note: For example, the volume of bioink per construct is 100 µL. If 30 constructs are printed, then the bioink volume needed is 3 mL.\nCalculate the number of cells needed:\nNcells = Ccell (1.1 × Vbiolink)\nResuspend the cells (Ncells) in 1/10th the volume of the bioink:\nVcell suspension = 0.1 × Vbiolink\n\t\tNOTE: For example, if Vbioink = 3 mL, then Vcell suspension = 0.1 × 3 mL = 0.3 mL\n2. Mixing of Cell Suspension and Bioink\nTransfer the cell suspension into the cell suspension syringe.\nTransfer the bioink to another syringe or obtain a syringe containing the bioink.\nPull the bioink syringe plunger back and insert the syringe into the dispensing unit. Position the unit vertically with the Luer lock connector upwards (Figure 1f1).\nPull the plunger of the cell syringe back to a similar length as the bioink syringe and insert into the dispensing unit (Figure 1f2).\nAttach both syringes to the mixing unit by twisting the Luer lock connectors (Figure 1f3).\nPrime the mixing system by pushing on the dispensing unit to extrude the air in the syringe. Stop the priming prior to the solution reaching the Luer lock (Figure 1g4).\nAfter priming, attach the filling cartridge to the end of the mixing unit via the Luer lock connector (Figure 1g5). Ensure that the plunger in the filling cartridge is at the bottom prior to attachment.\nSlowly compress (Figure 1h6) the dispensing unit to mix the bioink and cell suspension together into the cartridge (Figure 1i7).\nPush the plunger in the filling cartridge downward with a sterile pipet tip to contact the bioink-cell mixture after mixing. Keep the dispensing until compressed to ensure the cell/bioink mixture is not extruded back into the mixing unit.",
    "Cap the cartridge and gently tap on the work surface to move any air bubbles to the top of the cartridge (piston end).\n\tNOTE: At this point, the cell/bioink mixture is ready for printing. The following sections will outline specific applications and printing procedures.\n3. Determination of Cell Viability Using a Mixing Unit Compared to Manual Spatula Mixing\nDetach human fibroblasts (passage 7) with a 0.5% trypsin/EDTA solution at 80% confluence, count the number, and resuspend in culture medium at sufficient cell density to achieve a final concentration after blending with the bioink (1:10 cell:bioink ratio) of 5 x 106 cells/mL.\nBlend cells into the bioink using either the passive mixing unit technique (Step 2) or via spatula to evaluate the effect of both techniques on cell viability.\nBlend the cells into the bioink using the passive mixing unit technique 1, 2, or 3 times prior to dispensing into a mold for cross-linking using 100 mM CaCl2.\n\tNOTE: To perform additional blends, mix the cell/bioink directly into a syringe rather than a cartridge. Then remix the blend through the mixing unit following the previous protocol but without the cell syringe component.\nBlend the cells into a separate bioink using manual mechanical mixing via a spatula for durations of 30, 60, or 90 s. Transfer the mixtures (for each mixing time) into a mold for cross-linking using 100 mM CaCl2.\nTransfer the samples to a well plate after the completion of cross-linking and culture under standard conditions.\nAfter 1 day of culture, wash the constructs (n = 3 - 4 per group) in serum-free cell culture medium for 30 min. Stain the cells in the constructs with a staining solution (4 µM Calcein AM, 1 µM Ethidium homodimer-1) for 30 min.",
    "Wash two additional times, and incubate the samples in serum-free cell culture medium for a total of 1 h at 37 °C. Transfer the samples to a live cell imaging solution.\nAcquire images via a digital color camera at 10X magnification using an inverted microscope with FITC and Texas Red filters, and analyze using image analysis software.\nRandomly select three images from each construct for quantification of cell viability.\nCalculate viability based on the ratio of live cells to total number of cells. Analyze the data via a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test.\n4. Bioprinting of Cartilage Analogs with a Single Cell Type\nDraw a 3D model of the desired tissue analog. Convert to a Gcode file for bioprinting and load the Gcode file on the bioprinter1.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, a square structure with dimensions 4.8 x 4.8 x 0.9 mm3 was exported as an STL file. A Gcode file was generated of the lattice structure using the following settings: layer thickness, 0.3 mm; infill pattern, rectilinear; infill density, 25%; speed, 10 mm/s.\nIsolate and cryopreserve primary human nasal chondrocytes (hNC) from patients following the referenced protocol1.\nThaw and expand cryopreserved hNCs and expand once in monolayer culture using standard culture medium at 37 °C. Detach cells at 80 - 90% confluence with a 0.5% trypsin/EDTA solution and count using a trypan blue exclusion protocol. All experiments were conducted using hNCs at passage 2.\nResuspend the hNCs at 100 x 106 cells/mL within 300 µL of culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid, in preparation for blending with the bioink.",
    "Blend the hNC cell suspension into a nanocellulose/alginate based bioink following the passive mixing unit protocol at a 10:1 bioink:cell suspension ratio to obtain a final cell concentration of 9 x 106 cells/mL.\nEnsure that the bioprinter is sterilized via UV exposure and wipe down with 70% ethanol. Maintain sterility by placing in a laminar flow cabinet.\nAttach sterile printing nozzles to the cartridges containing the bioink/cell suspension blends and insert into the bioprinter.\nCalibrate the bioprinter either manually or by the protocols specific to the printer.\nBioprint the lattice-structured, cell-laden constructs using the following printing parameters: 25G conical nozzle at a pressure of 25 kPa. Bioprint cell-free constructs (blended with cell medium containing no cells) as a control.\nCross-link the constructs by adding an ionic solution of 100 mM CaCl2 for 5 min. Rinse the constructs and incubate in culture medium under standard culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity). Change the media every second or third day.\nCollect samples for histological analysis at weeks 2 and 4. Stain the samples for GAG production using an Alcian blue stain18.\n5. Bioprinting of Skin Analogs with Two Cell Types\nDraw a 3D model of the desired tissue analog and convert to a Gcode file for bioprinting. Load the Gcode file on the bioprinter.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol, a square structure with dimensions 4.8 x 4.8 x 0.9 mm3 was exported as an STL file. Then a Gcode file was generated of the lattice structure using the following settings: layer thickness, 0.3 mm; infill pattern, rectilinear; infill density, 25%; speed, 10 mm/s.\nPrepare the cells for blending into the bioink for bioprinting. For the fabrication of skin analogs, two cell types were utilized. The two cell types were blended into the bioink and bioprinting.",
    "Obtain primary HDF. Maintain these cells in DMEM growth media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid. Detach cells at 80 - 90% confluence with a 0.5% trypsin/EDTA solution and count.\nIsolate and cryopreserve primary hNC from patients following the referenced protocol1. Thaw and expand cryopreserved hNCs in monolayer culture. Detach cells at 80 - 90% confluence with a 0.5% trypsin/EDTA solution and count.\nResuspend both cell types at 100 x 106 cells/mL within growth media. Mix the cell suspensions together at a 1:1 ratio to achieve a final total concentration of 100 x 106 cells/mL in 300 µL of media.\nBlend the 50:50 cell suspension of HDF and hNC into a nanocellulose/alginate based bioink following the passive mixing unit protocol at a 10:1 bioink:cell suspension ratio to obtain a final cell concentration of 9 x 106 cells/mL.\nEnsure that the bioprinter is sterilized or is placed in a laminar flow cabinet to maintain sterility.\nAttach sterile printing nozzles to the cartridges containing the bioink/cell suspension blends and insert into the bioprinter.\nCalibrate the bioprinter either manually or the protocols specific to the printer.\nBioprint the lattice-structured, cell-laden constructs using the following printing parameters: 25G conical nozzle at a pressure of 25 kPa.
