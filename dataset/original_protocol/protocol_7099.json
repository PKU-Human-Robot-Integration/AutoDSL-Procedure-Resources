    "Nucleic acid extractionIndividual embryos are collected into 96-well blocks. Embryos are lysed and total nucleic acid is bound to paramagnetic beads (SPRI). After washing, the nucleic acid is eluted from the beads using water (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4284/bioprotoc-12-01-4284-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic of the extraction workflow. An overview of the different parts of the extraction procedure. The steps for each part are shown inside the coloured arrows.Note: A clean working environment is essential. Use clean gloves and spray the bench, equipment, and gloves with RnaseZap, to avoid Rnase contamination. Collect single embryos in each well of a 2 mL round bottom assay block. Collect the embryos in 9 μL of egg water using truncated pipette tips. Pre-chill the plate on dry ice, and lower the pipette tip to the bottom of each well, to freeze the embryo instantly. Label the plate on the front and side with the well numbers that contain collected embryos and the experiment name. Seal the plate using adhesive plate seals. Pull the seal on the sides and secure the plate. Do not pull them over the labelled side as the ink may come off when the seal is removed. Immediately place on dry ice for ~5 min. From this step, you can either proceed to extraction straight away or store the plate at -80°C until needed.On the day of extraction Remove Agencourt RNAClean XP/AMPure XP beads from the fridge to come to room temperature over 30 min. Shake well to resuspend beads.Prepare 70% ethanol fresh. You will need ~700 μL per well.Under the fume hood Prepare lysis buffer as below:RLT buffer (as needed, stored at RT) + 10 μL of 14.3 M β-mercaptoethanol for every 1 mL of RLT buffer. For single embryo extractions, 110 μL of RLT buffer/well is enough to sufficiently lyse the tissue.",
    "Make a pre-mix in a 5 mL tube for up to 24 samples, or multi-channel dispensing dish. Dispose of solid and liquid waste containing β-mercaptoethanol according to institutional guidelines.If you are using RLT plus buffer, add 0.5% v/v of Reagent Dx. Buffer RLT plus contains detergent which foams on agitation. Reagent Dx is an antifoaming reagent and prevents loss of material as foam.Take the embryo plate out of -80°C and place on dry ice. While still on dry ice, add 110 μL of RLT buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol to the wells using a multichannel pipette.Add one 5 mm stainless steel bead in each well of the plate containing the embryos with clean gloved hands.Note: Clean gloves with RNaseZap, to avoid RNase contamination. Using a TissueLyser Single-Bead Dispenser (see Materials and Reagents) is an alternative. Remove the plate from the dry ice and allow time to defrost. Dry the top of the plate with a clean tissue and seal using adhesive foil plate seals. Do not push the seal inside the wells, as this will make it more likely that the bead will pierce the seal in the TissueLyser.Alternatively, if using a heat sealer, seal the plate 6 times using a heat seal at 170°C for 3 s. Wait a few seconds between seals and secure the sides by using a plate seal roller. The extra layers of seals ensure that the bead does not pierce the seal during agitation.Notes:  Sealing the plate properly before using the TissueLyser is imperative to avoid the steel bead piercing the seal and causing sample loss and cross contamination. If using a heat sealer, we use 6 layers of seals. If using adhesive foil seals, allow some time at room temperature after adding the RLT-buffer before sealing to give time for the plate to defrost.",
    "The top of the plate should be dried with a tissue, so the seal sticks on the plate and doesn’t come off. Do not press the film into the wells. This will make the bead more likely to pierce the seal. One side of the TissueLyser adapter is completely flat and the other side is not. Make sure that the flat side of the adapter is on top of the plate and that the adapter is tight. We recommend testing the integrity of your plate seals on a plate containing water before processing real samples. Install Plate Adaptor Set onto TissueLyser II, according to manufacturer's instructions. Arrange 2 mL assay blocks on the adaptor. Make sure the adaptor is balanced, that the plates are aligned properly between the adaptors, and the adaptor is not at an angle. Run protocol at 12 Hz frequency for 5 min at room temperature.When the Tissue Lyser program ends, briefly spin the sample plate to collect the lysate at the bottom of the plate. If the lysate does not appear homogeneous, rerun the program at 12 Hz at two minutes increments until the lysate appears homogenous.Note: The following steps need to be done under the fume hood. While the sample is lysing, add 1.8× volumes (180 μL) AgenCourt RNAClean XP beads to the appropriate wells of a clean V bottom 0.3 mL plate. The volume of 180 µL is based on using 100 µL of lysate in the next step.Note: The ratio of 1.8× is the same if using AMPure XP beads. Add 100 μL of lysate to the plate prepared in Step 10. Set the volume to 150 µL on a multichannel pipette; pipet up and down to mix lysate and beads thoroughly. Avoid introducing bubbles.",
    "Incubate in the fume hood at room temperature for 15 min.Place the plate containing the sample on the plate magnet and leave for 10 min, or until the solution is clear.Remove supernatant using a multichannel pipette (without disturbing beads).While still on the magnet, add 200 μL of 70% ethanol (made from standard stock ethanol) to cover beads without disturbing and leave for 30 s. Do not resuspend the beads.Carefully remove ethanol without disturbing the beads into the ethanol waste and repeat wash for a total of three times.In the final wash, thoroughly remove any residual ethanol using a multichannel pipette without disturbing the beads.Note: You can now leave the fume hood. Air dry sample at room temperature for 10-15 min, or until there is no remaining trace of liquid and the beads appear dry. Do not over dry, or else re-suspending the beads becomes difficult.Add 58 μL of RNase-free water and re-suspend beads using pipette. DO NOT VORTEX. Using the same tip, gently flush the beads down the tube by pipetting the water over the beads, until all the beads are in suspension.Note: If a more concentrated sample is desired, a smaller volume of water can be used. Use at least 35 μL of water to ensure optimum recovery. Incubate on the bench at room temperature for 5 min.Place on magnet and leave for 5 min or until the solution is clear.Carefully transfer supernatant to a fresh clearly labelled 96-well superplate, being careful not to take up any beads. The supernatant contains both RNA and genomic DNA. Keep on ice.Note: Keep extracts on ice until genotyping is done (if being done on the same day), otherwise keep at -80°C. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles cause degradation of samples.",
    "GenotypingGenotyping for each embryo is done with KASP genotyping using the genomic DNA present in the total nucleic acid sample from Step 22 above. For more information on KASP genotyping see https://biosearch-cdn.azureedge.net/assetsv6/KASP-brochure.pdf[href=https://biosearch-cdn.azureedge.net/assetsv6/KASP-brochure.pdf].Add 8 μL of KASP reaction master mix per well in a 96-well KASP plate with a repeater pipette.Add 1 μL of extracted sample as template per well.Run on a thermocycler using the program in Table 1.Read fluorescence using FRET-capable plate reader or a qPCR machine.Note: For genotyping, we use a BMG LABTECH PHERAstar, but any FRET-capable plate reader will work. It is also possible to use a qPCR machine. see https://www.biosearchtech.com/support/education/kasp-genotyping-reagents/running-kasp-genotyping-reactions[href=https://www.biosearchtech.com/support/education/kasp-genotyping-reagents/running-kasp-genotyping-reactions].Table1.  KASP reaction cycling parameters. table:",

    "DNase I treatmentGenomic DNA is removed by DNase I treatment of the total nucleic acid sample minus any amount used for genotyping.Note: After this step the sample can no longer be used for genotyping. Set up reaction as follows:Total nucleic acidDNase I  1 μL10× DNase I buffer  10 μLMake up the total volume to 100 μL with RNase-free water.Seal the plate and heat at 37°C for 10 min.Add 1 μL of 0.5M EDTA to each well.Note: DNase I is inactivated in Step 4 by incubating at 75°C. However, the DNase I buffer contains Mg2+ which will cause divalent cation-induced fragmentation of the RNA at high temperatures. Thus, EDTA is added to chelate the Mg2+ and prevent this. Seal the plate and incubate at 75°C for 10 min to inactivate DNase I.Transfer samples to a V bottom 0.3 mL plate. Shake the RNAClean XP bottle to resuspend any beads that may have settled. Add 200 μL of Agencourt RNA XP beads to each well and mix well by pipetting. Take care not to introduce bubbles.Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.Place the plate containing the sample on the plate magnet and leave for 10 min or until the solution is clear.Remove supernatant using a multichannel pipette (without disturbing beads).While still on the magnet, add 200 μL of 70% ethanol to cover beads without disturbing and leave for 30 s. Do not resuspend the beads.Carefully remove ethanol without disturbing the beads and repeat wash for a total of three times.In the final wash, thoroughly remove any residual ethanol using a multichannel pipette without disturbing the beads.Air dry sample at room temperature for 10-15 min, or until there is no remaining trace of liquid and the beads appear dry. Do not over dry, or else re-suspending the beads becomes difficult.",
    "Add 52 μL of RNase-free water and re-suspend beads using pipette. DO NOT VORTEX. Using the same tip, gently flush the beads down the tube by pipetting the water over the beads, until all the beads are in suspension.Note: This elution volume is for TruSeq Stranded Illumina kits. Please adjust the elution volume to match the first step in the protocol that you will be using. Incubate on the bench at room temperature for 5 min.Place on magnet and leave for 5 min, or until the solution is clear.Carefully transfer 50 μL of supernatant to a fresh clearly labelled 96-well superplate, being careful not to take up any beads.RNA Quantification and QCMeasure RNA concentration using Quant-iTTM RNA Assay Kit, as per manufacturer’s instructions.Assess quality of the RNA using Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico or equivalent method. Most RNA-seq kits recommend a minimum RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 8 or higher. For qRT-PCR analysis, this step can be skipped.Calculate volume of RNA needed for the experiment. In a separate 96-well plate, transfer the appropriate volume of RNA. Use the same concentration for all samples.Proceed to RNA sequencing library preparation per manufacturer's protocols, for example Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA.RNA produced by this protocol is also suitable for qRT-PCR.
