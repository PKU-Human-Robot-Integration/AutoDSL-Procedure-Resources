    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol below describes the specific steps for assessing DNA damage by comet assay of colonic mucosal samples. However, other types of cells can be used but will need specific validation and setting up, as shown for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in Perdry et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].\nCollection of murine colonic mucosa cells\nTiming: 15 min/mouse\nThe following steps aim to collect colonic epithelial cells from mouse mucosa.\nCritical: Light might damage cell DNA and induce a bias in the comet assay protocol. Therefore, we recommend to avoid natural light and to work in an environment with no direct source of artificial light.\nPlace 1.5 mL labeled tubes with 500 μL of HBSS-EDTA (1 tube per animal) on ice\nLongitudinally open the mice abdomen\nCollect the colon from the caecum to the rectum\nWash the colon in a Petri dish full of 1× PBS\nOpen the colon following a lengthwise axis\nCollect 0.5 cm of the distal part for comet assay (the remaining part of the colon can be used for other types of analysis)\nPlace the colon specimen on a microscope slide and scratch the mucosa using a scalpel blade\nCritical: It is important to scratch the mucosa profoundly in order to collect all the cells.\nTransfer the mucosal material in the tube containing 500 μL of HBSS-EDTA\nPlace the tube back on ice\nCritical: After collection, it is important to freeze the samples within an hour to avoid sample degradation leading to DNA breaks.\nLet the tube slowly freeze at −80°C (Mister frosty or polystyrene box)\nWait at least 24 h before transferring the tubes to a classical −80°C box",
    "Note: The freezing step is optional and comet assay can be performed just after collection of mucosal sample in case that there is less than one hour between sampling and the first step of the comet assay. However, make sure to always follow a consistent protocol (with or without freezing) within the same project.\nInclusion of cells in gels, lysis, electrophoresis, neutralization, and fixation\nTiming: 1 day or 2 half-days in case of overnight (16 h) lysis step\nThese steps aim to perform the comet assay per se from the cell isolation to the fixation.\nIsolation of cells and preparation of single-cell suspension\nAllow the samples to defrost approximately 2 h at +4°C\nKeep the tubes on ice\nRemove the HBSS-EDTA buffer gently (no centrifugation is needed)\nAdd 750 μL of cold HBSS-EDTA buffer to the tissue and transfer the buffer containing the tissue to the Dounce tissue grinder\nAdd 750 μL of cold HBSS-EDTA to the grinder for a final volume of 1.5 mL.\nMechanically dissociate the cells (40 times up and down with the pestle)\nCritical: As any kind of manipulation could induce DNA damage and therefore a bias in the comet assay, we recommend to manipulate the cells as little as possible (do not filter cells and avoid too many up and downs with the pestle).\nCollect 15 μL of sample and dilute it with 15 μL of Trypan blue\nDetermine the number of living cells (for example using hemocytometer)\nCritical: From animal experiment, it is expected to get at least 75% of alive cells. We recommend to don’t perform the assay if the number of live cells is low or to be precautious with the interpretation.",
    "Note: If the number of cells is too high to be accurately counted, an intermediate dilution (for example 1:5) in HBSS-EDTA is recommended. The use of a hemocytometer and Trypan blue allow to us check that the suspension is made mainly of alive single cells.\nCollect a total (live + dead) of 90,000 cells/condition\nCentrifuge 10 min at 200 g (slow brake around 2, +4°C)\nCritical: Be sure to prepare in the same way positive and negative samples for your experiment. For example, it is possible to use cryopreserved aliquots from a single batch of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or mammalian cell lines that have been exposed or not to a DNA damaging agent. Cells treated with Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), which are DNA damaging agent, can be used as positive control. The drug concentration is depending on the cell type, we would suggest performing pilot experiment with 500 μM to 1 mM of MMS or 5–10 mM of EMS for 2 h at 37°C.\nCell inclusion in agarose and deposit on Gelbond® film\nLay the metal plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) on ice, and place deposit pattern on the top: for example, 2×20 deposits/Gelbond® (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1128-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Sample deposit\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1128-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Deposit pattern (actual size, printable)\nPut the Gelbond® films in the holder (optional), annotate them and position them on their patterns on the appropriate face.\nNote: Gelbond® is a polyester film with a treated surface that binds to the agarose gel on the hydrophilic side (it can be checked using water droplets that spread on the hydrophilic side but bead up on the hydrophobic side).\nDiscard the supernatant of the cells",
    "Critical: It is recommended to be very careful at this step and discard gently the supernatant to avoid detachment and loss of cell pellet.\nAdd 300 μL of LMP agarose\nMix gently using a pipette and load 15 μL of samples/deposit.\nBe sure to deposit each sample in duplicate or triplicate.\nNote: As the volume of agarose is low (15 μL) and the Gelbond® is laid on the cold metal plate, the agarose solidifies immediately and there is no need to wait after the last deposit to transfer the Gelbond® in the lysis solution.\nLysis step\nTransfer the holder with Gelbond® film in a container containing enough cold lysis solution to cover all the deposits during at least 1 h at +4°C (this step can be prolonged to overnight, 16 h) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1128-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Lysis steps\nUnwinding and electrophoresis step (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1128-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Electrophoresis step\nPlace the holder with Gelbond® for 40 min in a box containing the electrophoresis solution at +4°C\nTransfer them to the electrophoresis tank\nCover with fresh and cold electrophoresis solution (+4°C)\nRun the samples for 24 min at 28 V (corresponding to 0.8 V/cm, see Note)\nNote: The voltage used depends on the length of the electrophoresis tank. As the distance between the 2 electrodes of our tank is 35 cm, the voltage used is 28 V (=35×0.8). If there are doubts about electrophoresis, a pilot experiment with positive and negative controls should be performed in order to check the presence of DNA in comet tails only in positive controls as shown in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7].\nNeutralization step\nPut the Gelbond® in cold PBS (+4°C, Enough volume to cover the Gelbond® depending on the size of the container, for example for a container 16×25 cm, 200 mL is needed) for 5 min",
    "Repeat previous step (16 a.) one more time\nFixation step\nSoak the Gelbond® in cold absolute ethanol for 1.5 h at +4°C\nNote: After fixation, the Gelbond® film can be stored several months before dyeing step in dried conditions, at room temperature (20°C–25°C), avoiding accumulation of dust on it.\nDyeing\nTiming: 25 minutes/Gelbond®\nThese steps aim to stain the cell DNA before the analysis.\nCut the Gelbond® to adjust the size to large microscope glass slide (one Gelbond® corresponds to 2 large microscope glass slides)\nGlue the Gelbond® on a microscope glass slide (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5])\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1128-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Gluing the Gelbond® film on microscope slides\nAdd 20 μL of SYBR Gold 1/10 in 20 mL of 1× TE buffer (obtained by dilution of 10× TE Buffer in ddH2O)\nIncubate the slide with the glued Gelbond ® film in SYBR Gold solution sufficient volume to cover the slide for 20 min in darkness (for example in small black boxes (10×8 cm) 20 mL of SYBR is needed), at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nRinse the slide with ddH2O\nCover with two rectangle cover slides\nAnalysis\nTiming: 2 h for 1 slide with 20 deposits\nThis step will allow taking pictures of cells that will be then quantified.\nAcquire images using a fluorescence microscope the same day (or after 1 night if kept in a humidified chamber at +4°C) with a FITC filter (Emission wavelength 475 +/- 14 nm, transmission Band: 500–550). Slides can be scanned using the Nikon NiS software at 20× magnification.\nNote: This step can be optimized by using a motorized microscope.\nPause point:\nSeveral pause points are possible but it is important to ensure that pause points are similar between different experiments inside the same project.\nLysis step overnight (16 h)",
