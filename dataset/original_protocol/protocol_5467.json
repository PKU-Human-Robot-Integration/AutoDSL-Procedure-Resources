    "Cell wall extraction   Collect 100 mg of mature Arabidopsis leaves (2 or 3 leaves) in a microcentrifuge tube. Note: We usually collect fully expanded leaves with no signs of senescence from 4 to 5 weeks old plants grown in 16-h days at 22 °C/18 °C light/dark temperature.   Grind for a few seconds with a pestle mounted on a bench pillar drill at about 600 rpm, keeping the sample submerged in liquid N2 (see Figure 1). Do not add liquid N2 to the sample. Pestles should be changed between samples.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170921/20170921230520_8249.jpg Figure 1. Grinding setup. The bottom half of a plastic 60 ml container was inserted in a block of insulation foam and covered with a perforated piece of polycarbonate. A channel was added to facilitate addition of liquid N2.    Add 1 ml of 80% ethanol. Vortex for 5 sec and heat for 10 min at 50 °C in a dry block heater. Centrifuge for 5 min at 3,000 x g and discard the supernatant.   Add 1 ml of 100% ethanol to the precipitate. Vortex for 5 sec and keep at room temperature for 10 min. Centrifuge for 5 min at 3,000 x g and discard the supernatant.   Add 1 ml of acetone to the precipitate. Vortex for 5 sec and keep at room temperature for 10 min. Centrifuge for 5 min at 3,000 x g and discard the supernatant.   Dry samples in a Speed-Vac for 5 min approximately. Note: We try to avoid complete drying to facilitate resuspension. Samples can also be air-dried. Dried samples can be stored at -20 °C for later processing.     Extraction of enzyme-accessible xyloglucan   Add 1 ml of 100 mM NaCl to dried wall residue and resuspend in an ultrasonic bath for at least 20 min. Vortex the sample for 5 sec several times during resuspension.",
    "Centrifuge for 3 min at 18,000 x g and discard the supernatant.   Add 1 ml of water to cell wall residue, vortex for 5 sec and incubate in an ultrasonic bath for at least 5 min. Centrifuge for 3 min at 18,000 x g and discard the supernatant. Repeat for a total of two times.   Add 350 μl of digestion buffer (see Recipes). Note: Complete resuspension is not necessary as it will be finished during overnight incubation.   Pipette a volume of cellulase suspension that contains 6 units of enzyme per sample into a centrifugal filter. Volume will vary depending on enzyme batch. Add 450 μl of digestion buffer. Centrifuge for 5 min at 14,000 x g and discard the filtrate.   Add 450 μl of digestion buffer. Centrifuge for 5 min at 14,000 x g and discard the filtrate. Repeat for a total of two times.    Add 50 μl of digestion buffer per sample to the retentate and pipette to a clean centrifuge tube. Note: Steps B4 to B6 can be carried out while cell wall residue is resuspended.   Pipette 50 μl of the enzyme solution obtained in step B6 to each of the resuspended cell wall samples from step B3.   Incubate overnight in an orbital shaker at 37 °C and 150 rpm.   The next day wash one centrifugal filter per sample by adding 500 μl of water, centrifuging for 3 min at 14,000 x g and removing the filtrate. Repeat this process for a total of 3 times. Note: This step is necessary to remove traces of a polymer, which will otherwise interfere with the MALDI-TOF analysis.   Centrifuge the cell wall digestion for 5 min at 18,000 x g.   Pipette the supernatant to a pre-washed centrifugal filter. Centrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 x g.",
    "Discard the filter and dry the filtrate on a Speed-Vac. Note: Some residue is usually visible at the bottom of the tube.   Store at -20 °C.      Extraction of non-accessible xyloglucan   Wash the cell wall residue from the accessible xyloglucan extraction (precipitate from step B10) by adding 1 ml of water, centrifuging for 5 min at 18,000 x g and discarding the supernatant. Repeat for a total of two times.   Add 900 μl of 17% NaOH (w/v) and incubate overnight in an orbital shaker at 37 °C.   Add 300 μl of acetic acid and centrifuge for 5 min at 18,000 x g.   Pipette 500 μl of the supernatant onto a centrifugal filter, centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10-15 min and discard the filtrate. Add additional supernatant and repeat until all of it has been filtered.   Add 500 μl of digestion buffer to the filter, centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15-20 min and discard the filtrate. Repeat for a total of two times.    Add 350 μl of digestion buffer to the filter and pipette the retentate to a new microcentrifuge tube.   Follow the procedure for extraction of enzyme-accessible xyloglucan starting in step B4.     MALDI-TOF analysis   Resuspend dried xyloglucan digestion (step B13) in 20 μl of 10 mM NaCl by repeated pipetting. Centrifuge at 18,000 x g for 2 min.   Pipette 2 μl from the top of the solution into a clean 200 μl PCR tube and add 6 μl of SDHB solution (see Recipes). Pipette 2 μl of the mixture onto the MALDI target plate.    To prepare a calibration spot mix 2 μl of a 2 mM solution of xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Megazyme) with 6 μl of SDHB solution. Pipette 2 μl of the mixture onto the MALDI target plate.   Air dry at room temperature for approximately 30 min.",
    "Note: A dissecting microscope can be used to check the samples. Some crystals should be visible on the plate (Figure 2).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170921/20170921231213_3599.jpg Figure 2. Examples of crystallization on the MALDI plate. Although the sample on the left is cleaner both produced usable spectra. Bars = 1 mm.    Load the target plate onto a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer.    Operate the mass spectrometer in reflectron and positive mode, at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV with a PIE (Pulsed Ion Extraction) of 10 nsec. Set matrix suppression at 450 Da. Average a total of 600 laser shots delivered in 3 sets of 200 shots (at 100 Hz) to 3 different locations.   Calibrate the mass range using the calibration spot. The three main peaks correspond to the following sodium adducts: XXXG (C39H66033Na1, 1085.3384 Da), XXLG/XLXG (C45H76038Na1, 1247.3912) and XLLG (C51H86043Na1, 1409.4440). These abbreviations correspond to the standard xyloglucan oligosaccharide nomenclature (Tuomivaara et al., 2015).   Compile mass spectra for each sample by plotting the mass over charge (m/z) ratio (x-axis) of all detected ion species against their measured intensities (y-axis) using Flex Analysis Version 3.0 (Bruker)."
