    "Prepare neutralized type I collagen on ice, following the manufacturer’s recommendations. As final concentration, use 3 mg/mL for type I collagen (stock concentration of type I collagen is 3.47 mg/mL), and make sure the final volume of the mixture is 5 mL.

Calculate the volume of 1 N NaOH (volume of collagen to be used x 0.023 mL = 0.1 mL). Calculate the volume of dH2O (final volume - volume of collagen - volume of 10x PBS - volume of 1 N NaOH = 5 mL - 4.32 mL - 0.5mL - 0.1 mL = 0.08 mL).
