    "Metabolic labeling of newly synthesized phospholipidsTo determine the time course of incorporation of deuterium labeled head groups into glycerophospholipids you need several dishes with adherent cells. The cells from a dish are collected at suitable times e.g., after 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h of incubation with the labeled head group precursors.Grow cells until dishes are 70-80% confluent. Adherent cells lines like HeLa, CHO or BHK-21 cells are suitable.Wash cells once with 1 ml of PBS to remove detached cells.Add 1 or 1.5 ml of the labeling medium (see Recipes) per 35 or 60 mm dish and incubate the cells for up to 48 h. Collect cells from a dish at suitable times. Wash the dish thrice with 1 ml of PBS and collect the cells by scraping in 2 ml of ice-cold H2O and move the cells to 12 ml screw-cap tubes.Vortex briefly, suspend cells with a pipette and collect e.g., 50 µl aliquots of the cell suspension for protein determination, if necessary.To the remaining suspension add 3 ml of methanol and vortex.Store at -20 °C until ready for extraction of the lipids.Pulse-chase experimentsTo determine the turn-over of glycerophospholipids first incubate the cells with the labeled precursors for up to 24 h, wash the cells with PBS and then incubate them in a medium containing the corresponding unlabeled head group precursors. During this chase period, collect cells from a dish at e.g., 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h of incubation to determine the rate of turnover.Label the newly synthesized phospholipids as described in steps 1a-1c for 4-24 h.Wash thrice with cell culture medium to remove the labeled precursors.Add 1 or 1.5 ml of the chase medium to each dish and incubate for up to 48 h.",
    "Collect cells (see steps 1d-1g) first at a 1-2 h interval and then with longer intervals. Extraction of lipidsAdd a cocktail of internal GPL standard consisting of di 20:1-PC, di 20:1-PE, di 20:1-PS and di 16:0-PI (10, 5, 2, 2 nmol per 100 nmol of total glycerophospholipid, respectively) for mass spectrometric analyses and then extract the lipids (see Notes). We use the Folch method of lipid extraction (Folch et al., 1957) except that no added salts are included. Add 6 ml of chloroform, add the caps and turn the tubes upside down and back again rapidly 40-50 times.Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 10 min.Transfer the lower phase with a glass Pasteur pipette to a new 12 ml screw-cap tube, add 4 ml of theoretical upper phase containing chloroform/methanol/H2O (3:48:47, v/v) and mix as described in step 3b.Centrifuge as in step 3c and collect the lower phase.Add 0.5 ml of methanol, vortex, and evaporate to dryness under nitrogen stream using mild heating (< 40 °C).Reconstitute extracted lipids in 20-40 µl of methanol/chloroform (4:1, v/v) in 12 x 32 mm screw-neck vials for LC-MS analysis, or in 250 µl of methanol/chloroform (2:1, v/v) in 11.5 x 75 mm test tubes for MS/MS analysis and store at -20 °C.Mass spectrometric analysisNote: It can be carried out using either LC-MS or MS/MS using direct sample infusion as indicated below.Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometryGPL molecular species were analyzed using an LC-MS system consisting of an Acquity FTN Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography instrument (WATERS) equipped with a 1.0 x 150 mm Acquity BEH C18 column connected to Quattro Micro or Premier triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (WATERS). The column was eluted with a gradient of isopropanol/acetonitrile (90:10) into acetonitrile/H2O (60:40) each containing 10 mM ammonium formate and 1% NH4OH (Kainu et al., 2013). The flow rate was 0.",
    "13 ml/min. Individual lipid species were detected using Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) as described (Kainu et al., 2013). Mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode and the precursor ions were [M + H]+ for PC, PE, PS and PI. The product ions for the unlabeled species were m/z 184 (PC), 141 (PE), 185 (PS) and 260 (PI) and for the deuterium-labeled species m/z 193, 145, 188 and 266, respectively. Typical m/z transitions are listed in Table 1. Water soluble GPL metabolites were also analyzed with LC-MS as described (Hermansson et al., 2016). Data were collected using the MassLynx 4.1 software (WATERS). MS/MS analysis with direct sample infusionThis method does not require LC instrument because the different GPLs in the crude lipid extract can be selectively detected based on their head group–specific fragmentation when the sample is infused to the mass spectrometer with a glass microsyringe at a rate of 10-20 µl/min. The unlabeled PC and PI species are selectively detected by scanning for precursors of m/z +184 and -241, respectively, while the unlabeled PE and PS species are detected by monitoring for a neutral loss (NL) of 141 or 87, respectively. The labeled PC, PI or PE and PS species are selectively detected by scanning for the precursors of 193 (PC) or 247 (PI) or neutral loss of 145 (PE) or 90 (PS).Table 1.
