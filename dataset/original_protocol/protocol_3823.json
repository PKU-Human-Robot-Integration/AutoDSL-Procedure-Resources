    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nVH library construction\nTiming: 8 weeks\nHigh diversity and large size are the characteristics of a good library and the basic requirements for successful library panning leading to selection of high affinity binders. Due to the limited diversity of PBMCs B cell antibody gene, it is unlikely to generate a large size VH library by direct PCR amplification of VH region from the cDNA of PBMCs. Therefore, overlap-PCR was used to combine different antibody heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to increase the size and diversity of VH genes. In this protocol, a well-defined stable scaffold IGVH3-23 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) was chosen as basic scaffold for framework Region (FR): FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4. The primer combinations used to amplify CDRs and overlap CDRs-FRs are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/740-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are amplified from human PBMC cDNA and grafted into a well-defined stable scaffold IGVH3-23.\n(B) CDR PCR results of different immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGVH) subgroups (IGHV1 to IGHV7) and overlap-PCR assembled VH. Below are illustrations of the results:\nThe CDR1 PCR products subgroups (∼74 bp) in each row (Row 1: IGHV1. Row 2: IGHV2. Row 3: IGHV3. Row 4: IGHV4. Row 5: IGHV5. Row 6: IGHV6. Row 7: IGHV7).\nThe CDR2 PCR products subgroups (∼114 bp) in each row (Row 1: IGHV1. Row 2: IGHV2, 4. Row 3: IGHV3, 6. Row 4: IGHV5. Row 5: IGHV7).\nThe CDR3 PCR products subgroups (∼132 bp) in each row (Row 1–3: IGHV1, 2, 5, 7. Row 4: IGHV3. Row 5: other subgroups).\nOverlap-PCR assembled VH results (Row 1–5: IGHV1∼7 mixture, ∼430 bp).",

The restriction sites were marked in yellow, complementary sequences were highlighted by underline, overlapping sequences were marked in red.\nDissolve the primers with ddH2O and adjust the concentration to 10 μM.\nAssemble the VH with PCR (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nPCR amplify FR1, CDR1, CDR2, FR3 and CDR3 separately with High Fidelity PCR Master kit. Different primer combinations as shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) using the following cycling conditions:\n50 μL PCR system:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_740_7.csv\nThermocycling conditions for PCR:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_740_8.csv\nRun all the PCR samples with 2% agarose gel to verify the size and purify the right size PCR products (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) from the agarose gel with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.\nCritical: The template cDNA is a mixture; the primers may have non-specific binding with the cDNA to PCR out some non-specific DNA bands. In the experiment, only the target bands will be purified for further overlapping PCR process to assembly full-length VH.\nOver-lapping PCR to assemble full-length VH with FR1, CDR1, CDR2, FR3 and CDR3 DNA purified from step 2a as template, ALL-F and ALL-R as primes using the following cycling conditions:\n50 μL PCR system:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_740_9.csv\nThermocycling conditions for PCR:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_740_10.csv\nRun all the PCR samples with 2% agarose gel to verify the size and purify the right size PCR products (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) from the agarose gel with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.\nNote: If the over-lapping PCR productivity is low. Assemble the fragments with two steps (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).",
    "Digest the pComb3X plasmid and VH gene repertoires with SfiI restriction enzyme in PCR tubes at 50°C for 12 h with the following conditions:\n100 μL digest system:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_740_11.csv\nTotal 1.5 mg pComb3X and 500 μg VH gene needed.\nCritical: The size of pComb3X plasmid is ∼9 fold larger than VH DNA. With the same amount of DNA, VH has higher molarity. So, more SfiI is needed to digest the VH DNA completely.\nRun all the digested DNA with 1% agarose gel to verify the size and purify the digested products (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) from the agarose gel with QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit.\nLigation of purified VH fragments to pComb3X vector using a molar ratio of 3:1 VH fragments to pComb3X at 16°C for 60 h with the following conditions:\n100 μL ligation system:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_740_12.csv\nTotal 50 mL ligation is needed for a 1011 size library construction.\nCritical: In case of degradation, a 100 μL small-scale pilot experiments should be performed to check the degradation at 24, 48 and 60 h with 1% agarose gel before large scale experiment. Choose the time with no significant degradation detected for ligation. In this library construction, 60 h is a good choice.\nRecover the ligation DNA with DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4003t_d4003_d4004_d4013_d4014_dna_clean_concentrator_-5.pdf[href=https://files.zymoresearch.com/protocols/_d4003t_d4003_d4004_d4013_d4014_dna_clean_concentrator_-5.pdf]).\nCritical: Each column is load with 5 μg ligation DNA and eluted with 6 μL ddH2O. The efficiency of ligation DNA recovery is ∼30%. ∼150 μg ligation DNA can be recovered with the DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit.\nPool all the eluted DNA and determine the DNA concentration by Nanodrop Lite.\nElectroporate TG1 Electrocompetent Cells with the following conditions:",
    "Add 1 μg ligation DNA into each vial of TG1 cells (1 μg DNA in 50 μL competent bacteria per vial). Stir with tips 20 times and keep on ice 5–10 min.\nTransfer the bacteria into ice pre-chilled 0.1 cm cuvette.\nElectroporate using the pre-set program with setting at 1.8 kV/ 200 ohms/25 μF.\nWash the cuvette with 1 mL pre-warm 2-YT medium three times and transfer the bacteria into 50 mL pre-warm 2-YT medium.\nNote: During large scale electroporation, 10 electroporated/transformed TG1 vials are resuspended with 500 mL pre-warm 2-YT medium in a 2 L shake flask. Around 150 electroporation vials are needed for > 1011 size library construction, thus 15 × 2 L shake flasks with 7.5 L pre-warm 2-YT medium is needed to resuspend all the electroporated/transformed TG1 cells.\nRecover the bacteria at 37°C, 200 rpm for 30 min, Aliquot 1/105 bacteria (5 μL culture medium) from each bottle into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube which contain 995 μL fresh 2-YT medium for titration. 10-fold serial dilute the bacteria and take 1/107, 1/108 and 1/109 of total bacteria (100 μL of 10-, 102- and 103-fold diluted samples) from the dilutions, plate onto 2-YT-Agar plates with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Select the transformants by adding 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 2% glucose, shaking at 37°C, 200 rpm for 2–3 h till the OD600 reach to ∼0.6–0.8.\nAdd M13KO7 helper phage into the cells with multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 10:1, incubate at 37°C, 45 min. Mix every 15 min during incubation.",
    "Note: MOI means the ratio of phages added to bacteria. OD600 of 1 corresponds to approximately 5 × 108 TG1 cells per ml. If the OD600 ≈ 0.6, total TG1 cells equals 0.6 × 5 × 108/mL × 7500 mL ≈ 2.25 × 1012, and ≈ 2.25 × 1013 M13KO7 helper phage are needed for the infection.\nCentrifuge the bacteria at 5,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. Resuspend the bacterial pellet with fresh 2-YT contain 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 50 μg/mL kanamycin.\nShaking at 30°C, 200 rpm overnight (12–15 h).\nSpin down the bacteria at 8,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, transfer the supernatant into new bottles, add 25% volume of PEG/NaCl solution into the supernatant and incubate on ice for 1 h.\nCentrifugation of the mixture at 11,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 50 mL ice cold DPBS per liter of culture.\nCentrifugation again at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to eliminate the bacterial contamination.\nCritical: This bacteria elimination step is critical before storage, it will eliminate most of the bacteria in the phage library. The remaining bacteria will be eliminated by multiple rounds of wash during the phage panning process.\nTransfer all the supernatant into a new bottle, add 20% glycerol and aliquot into 1 mL/vial, stock at −80°C for long-term storage. Determine the phage titer by detecting OD268 (1 OD ≈ 5 × 1012 phage)(Durr, Nothaft et al. 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The phage titer should above 5 × 1012/mL",
    "Critical: 50 mL ligation with 375 μg digested pComb3X and 125 μg VH is needed for a > 1011 size library. ∼150 μg ligation DNA can be recovered with DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (efficiency is ∼30%). 1 μg ligation is used for one electroporation. Each electroporation will result in > 109 colonies, 150 electroporation will produce > 1.5 × 1011 colonies in total. According to the Sanger sequencing results, ∼30% of the plasmid are empty vector, junk DNA or VH with stop codon. So, 50 mL ligation should get a > 1.05 × 1011 size library.\nQuality checks of the library:\nRandomly pick > 100 colonies and scale up in 4 mL 2-YT medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, shaking at 200 rpm overnight (12–15 h).\nPurify the plasmid with QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and elute with 30 μL water.\nSend all the plasmid for sequencing and analyze all the sequences.\nCritical: All the VH sequences should be different from each other. ∼30% of the plasmid are empty vector, junk DNA or VH with stop codon.\nNote: If repeat VHs are detected, the quality of the library is not good and library size might be smaller than 1011, so re-construction of the library to make the size >1011 is needed.\nNote: We are using two asymmetric SfiI sites for library construction. Sequencing results showed there is no issue of orientation of VH insert in our pComb3X system.\nNote: Beside randomly picked > 100 colonies for sequencing, we also evaluated the library quality and performance by panning with more than 5 antigens. For a high-quality library, several dozens of different VH binders binding to each antigen were enriched. Multiple binders and the diversity of the selected VH binders revealed good quality of library.\nMolecular cloning, antigen expression, and protein purification",
    "Compare with the microbial expression system, mammalian cell expression has the advantage of protein expression, more advanced peptide folding and post-translational modifications (Gray 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Khan 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). In general, antigens expressed from mammalian cells which have proper folding and post-translational modifications are essential for full biological activity and successful selection of high affinity specific binders. Here we used the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) as an example. This section includes molecular cloning, expression, and purification (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/740-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. RBD-AviTag antigen expression\n(A) An overview of RBD-AviTag transient expression and stable cell pool selection. There are three steps in RBD-AviTag expression: Step 1: Molecular cloning of the pIW-Zeo-RBD plasmid (4 days were needed). Step 2: Overnight transfection of the Expi293TM cell with pIW-Zeo-RBD plasmid (1 day was needed). Step 3: After transfection, cells were maintained at 37°C in incubator shaker rotating at 135 rpm with 8% CO2 and 85% humidity for 3–7 days for RBD-AviTag transient expression. Or select stable cell pool with Zeocin antibiotic (step 18e, optional).\n(B) SDS-PAGE results of RBD-AviTag with or W/O DTT. Line 1 (L1) and Line 2 (L2): Both RBD-AviTag samples with or W/O DDT shown three bands. Line 3 (L3) and line 4 (L4): After deglycosylation, only one band was detected in both L3 and L4. The results show multiple bands due to glycosylation of the RBD-AviTag protein.

After recovering for 45–60 min at 37°C (shaking at 200 rpm), spread cells onto a 2-YT agar plate supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Incubate the plate in a 37°C incubator overnight (12–15 h).\nRandomly pick several colonies and scale up in 4 mL 2-YT medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, shaking at 200 rpm overnight (12–15 h).\nPurify the plasmid with QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and elute with 50 μL water. Verification of the plasmid by DNA sequencing and keep the right clones (pIW-Zeo-RBD, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nRBD-AviTag antigen expression\nTiming: 7 days\nTransfection and Protein Expression (30 mL expression, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A):\nThe day before transfection, seed the cells at a density of 2.0 × 106 viable cells/mL and incubate at 37°C in incubator shaker rotating at 135 rpm with 8% CO2 and 85% humidity.",
    "On the day of transfection, determine number and viability of the cells using an automated cell counter. Dilute the cells to 3 × 106 viable cells/mL with Expi293™ Expression Medium.\nAdd 27 mL cell suspension into a 125 mL Erlenmeyer shaker flask. Return the cells to the incubator.\nprepare DNA-PEI complexes as follows:\nDilute 30 μg of plasmid DNA into 1.5 mL Expi293™ Expression Medium, mix gently and incubate for 5 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nDilute 120 μg of PEI into 1.5 mL Expi293™ Expression Medium, mix gently and incubate for 5 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nAfter 5 min incubation, mix the plasmid DNA with the PEI. Incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 10–20 min.\nAfter the DNA-PEI complex incubation is complete, add the complex into shaker flask from step 18c. Gently swirl the flask.\nReturn and incubate the cells in the incubator. Maintain 7 days at 37°C.\nNote: Some expressed proteins might have degradation, denaturation, or aggregation during several days culturing at 37°C. Short time culture can protect protein from degradation, denaturation or aggregation to get proteins of higher quality, while long time culturing has higher yield. For the RBD-AviTag expression, the yield of 3 days culture is ≈ 5mg/L, and of 7 days is higher than 10 mg/L. We also found the activity of RBD-AviTag purified at day 3 is better than that of day 7. Thus, according to our experience, 3 days of culture is sufficient for RBD-AviTag expression.\n(optional) 24 h after transfection, the transfected cells can be used for stable cell pool selection with the following steps (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A):\nTake 5 mL transfected cells into 50 mL centrifugation tube. Centrifugation at 300 g, 3 min. Return the supernatant into the expression bottle.",
    "Resuspend the cells with 5 mL Expi293™ Expression Medium contain 250 μg/mL Zeocin. Return and incubate the cells in the incubator.\nChange medium at day 1, day 2, day 3 and day 4 with 5 mL fresh Expi293™ Expression Medium containing 250 μg/mL Zeocin.\nNote: Because of the transfection efficiency variation, the viability of the cells at day 4 might be different. If the viability is < 30% at day 4, reduce the Zeocin concentration to 50 μg/mL for the following three days selection.\nIn our RBD-AviTag stable cell pool selection process, the viability is ∼64% at day 4. So, 250 μg/mL Zeocin was used for 7 days selection.\nChange medium at day 7 and resuspend the cells with 20 mL Expi293™ Expression Medium with 50 μg/mL Zeocin. Add the suspension cell into a 125 mL Erlenmeyer shaker flask, Return and incubate the cells in the incubator maintain 3–6 days (Stable cell pool is ready for expression).\nRBD-AviTag-His purification with Ni-NTA column\nTiming: 1 day\nProtein purification\nPrepare the Ni-NTA gravity column:\nTransfer 1 mL His Pur™ Ni-NTA Resin (10 mg protein/ 1 mL beads) into a gravity column.\nAllow the resin to settle, then let the excess buffer drain through the column by gravity flow.\nWash the resin with 20 mL Milli Q water.\nWash the resin with 20 mL binding buffer.\nCell culture media preparation:\nTransfer the expression medium at step 18 into a 50 mL conical tubes, spin down at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nPour supernatant into new conical tubes.

Then it is ready for bio-panning. This section describes streptavidin-magnetic beads-based library panning strategy.\nBiotin-label the RBD-AviTag (RBD-Bio) antigen with BirA Biotin-Protein Ligase Kit according to the manufacture’s protocol (https://www.avidity.com/showpdf.asp?N=B9B6C28E-1976-4CFE-89DE-E37D1D8DB2CA[href=https://www.avidity.com/showpdf.asp?N=B9B6C28E-1976-4CFE-89DE-E37D1D8DB2CA] ).\nLibrary panning with streptavidin magnetic Beads:\nThaw a phage library aliquot (1 mL/aliquot, ≈ 5 × 1012 phage/mL). Add 250 μL (VPEG/NaCl:Vphage = 1:4) PEG/NaCl solution into the phage, incubate on ice for 20 min.\nCentrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 200 μL DPBS.\nTake 2 × 1012 library phage diluted into 1 mL 3% BSA-DPBS. Add 10 μg RBD-Bio antigen, rotation 1.5 h at RT (20°C–25°C).\nCritical: The amount of antigen used for panning are different in each round while the incubation time did not change. In our protocol we used 10 μg for 1st round, 2nd round 5 μg, 3rd round 1 μg, 4th round 0.2 μg. (Use high concentration antigen at 1st round can help to enrich more binders. Lower concentration of antigens in the following panning process will help to enrich high affinity VH domains).",
    "At the same time, pick single colony from TG1 bacterial plate (LB-agar plate) or directly take 1 μL TG1 from commercial stock and scale up in 20 mL 2-YT medium at 37°C, 200 rpm until OD600 ≈ 0.5.\nTake 25 μL streptavidin beads into a 1.5 mL centrifugation tube, wash the beads with 1 mL DPBS twice with magnets stand.\nNote: Blocking the beads with 3% BSA-DPBS for 1 hour at RT (20°C–25°C) before use is good for panning. Because we have an extra step of depletion with streptavidin beads before panning (start from 2nd round), Streptavidin beads blocking is optional.\nTransfer the phage at step 21c into washed streptavidin beads, rotate the tubes at 10 RPM/min for 1 h at RT (20°C–25°C).\nWash the beads with 1 mL 0.05% PBST (0.05% Tween-20 in DPBS) for 5 times, then wash with DPBS twice.\nNote: Wash the beads with 0.05% PBST as follows: 1st round 5 times, 2nd round 8 times, 3rd round 15 times and 4th wash 20 times. (Increasing the washing numbers throughout the phage display selection can help to decrease low affinity binders. So that high affinity antibodies can be enriched efficiently).\nResuspend the beads with 5 mL TG1 cells (OD600 ≈ 0.5) in 15 mL culture tube, incubate the mixture at 37°C, 45 min. Mix every 15 min during incubation.\nCritical: The phage on the beads can infect TG1 cells effectively, so the elution step is not required.",
    "Take 1/103 infected TG1 cells (5 μL culture medium) into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube which contain 995 μL fresh 2-YT medium. 10-fold serial dilute the bacteria with 2-YT medium and take 1/104, 1/105 and 1/106 of total bacteria plate onto 2-YT-Agar plates with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The rest add 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 2% glucose, shaking at 37°C, 200 rpm for 2 h.\nAdd 10 μL M13KO7 helper phage (Cat#18311019, Thermo) into the cells (10 μL/5 mL, phage titer: 1011/mL), incubate at 37°C, 45 min.

TG1 is an amber codon (TAG) suppressor strain, allowing translation to read through the codon and to produce a full-length VH-gene III fusion protein. While the HB2151 is an amber codon non-suppressor strain, Only VH gene can be translation to produce VH in this strain. So, HB2151 is chosen for VH expression without need to re-clone the VH gene into another expression plasmid.\nPick single colony from the fresh transformed plate into 50 mL centrifugation tube which has 20 mL 2-YT medium containing 100 μg/mL of ampicillin, Incubate at 37°C, 200 rpm until OD600 ≈ 0.5.
