    "1. Processable PANI Synthesis\nDissolve aniline (1 ml, 11 mmol) completely in 60 ml of chloroform in a 250 ml round-bottom flask. Stir at 600 rpm for 5 min and cool to 0-5 °C with ice. This usually takes 15-20 min (Figure 2A).\nAdd sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate (NaDBS) (7.44 g, 21 mmol) to the aniline solution in a round-bottomed flask while stirring at 600 rpm.\nDissolve ammonium persulphate (APS) (3.072 g, 13.5 mmol) in 20 ml water and add all of it drop-wise over 30 min to avoid overheating the reaction.\nCarry out the reaction at 0-5 °C for 24 hr, and allow it to reach room temperature for another 24 hr.\nObserve the reaction mixture initially turn milky white after 15 min, then dark brown after 2 hr, and finally to dark green after 24 hr (Figure 2B-F).\nFilter the PANI-NaDBS solution with a Buchner funnel. Mix with 80 ml chloroform and 120 ml water in a separation funnel (Figure 2G).\nIncubate the solution for 24 hr at room temperature and collect the dark green PANI from the separation funnel, leaving unreacted NaDBS and APS in the aqueous supernatant.\n2. PANI-probe Mixing and UV Irradiation\nDilute PANI solution 10x with chloroform-water (1:3 v/v) and mix 200 µl of diluted PANI with 6.4 µmol of probe DNA oligonucleotides by gentle rocking for 15 min in a microfuge tube.\nIrradiate the PANI-DNA solution with 1,200 µJ/cm2 of UV in a crosslinker for 2 min. It is critical that UV exposure is limited to the indicated amount. Extended exposure to UV compromises the fluorescence change in PANI, likely due to covalent cross-linking of PANI and DNA.\nPellet complexes by centrifugation at 17,000 x g for 6 min, and wash with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Pellet again, and re-suspend in PBS.",
    "3. Hybridization of PANI-probe\nAdd 8 µl of 100 µM complementary DNA oligonucleotides or target nucleic acids to 200 µl of PANI-probe complexes.\nPerform hybridization by rocking solution mixture for 15 min at 40 °C.\nPellet the PANI complexes by centrifugation at 17,000 x g for 6 min. Wash with PBS and re-suspend in water.\n4. Emission Steady State Fluorescence Measurement\nAdd PANI from different treatments into a 96 well microplate and measure emission fluorescence in the 270-850 nm range by excitation at 250 nm. An emission peak for PANI should be observed around 500 nm.\n5. Fluorescence Microscopy Measurement of Hybridized Duplex\nDrop coat PANI on a borosilicate glass coverslip and dry at 40 °C for 48 hr.\nAdd probe (8 µl of 100 µM) on a dried PANI film and irradiate it with UV light (1,200 µJ/cm2) for 2 min.\nWash the PANI-probe film with PBS and dry at 40 °C for 48 hr.\nPerform hybridization for 15 min by adding target nucleic acids. This could be a biological sample or a control target oligonucleotide (8 µl of 100 µM). Follow with a PBS wash.\nObtain the fluorescent images at 40X magnification, with a 500 nm long pass filter.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
