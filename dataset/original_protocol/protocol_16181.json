    "This basic protocol comprises the fundamental steps of the taste-immune associative learning paradigm in rats to obtain a conditioned immune response mimicking the effects of the immunosuppressive drug CsA. Therefore, rats learn to associate the taste of saccharin with the pharmacological effect of CsA during the acquisition phase. Subsequently, the CR can be observed during the retrieval phase, when saccharin is re-presented without CsA (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-fig-0002]).\nThe strict drinking regimen twice a day is required to ensure adequate consumption of saccharin. For habituation of rats to the restrictive drinking procedure twice daily (9 a.m. and 5 p.m.), an initial training phase is needed (days 1 to 5). On days 6, 9, and 12 (acquisition), the rats are injected intraperitoneally with a therapeutic dose of CsA (20 mg/kg) after the drinking session in the morning (9 a.m.). The repetition every 3 days results in a conditioned avoidance of the taste (CTA), with reduced consumption of the saccharin, indicative of a strong association of the taste (CS) with the drug (US). The intermediate days between injections, as well as between acquisition and retrieval, guarantee adequate excretion of CsA to avoid residual pharmacological effects. Re-exposure to saccharin at subsequent retrieval (days 15 to 17) results not only in CTA but also, more importantly, in conditioned immunosuppression mimicking the initial pharmacological CsA effects. Conditioned immunosuppressive effects can be detected in ex vivo cultured splenocytes, which we describe in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-prot-0002]. To interpret results adequately, at least four groups should be implemented (for details, see Strategic Planning): “VEH-G.”, “CS0-G.”, “US-G.”, and “CS-G.”.",

Place 16 rats into single housing cages 7 days prior to start of the experiment and label cages with the respective numbers 1 to 16. Provide ad libitum access to food and tap water until water restriction regimen starts at day 1 (training, steps 5 to 8).",
    "3. Label water and saccharin bottles for each animal (32 drinking bottles total) according to their respective experimental ID (water: W1 to W16; saccharin: S1 to S16). Fill up all bottles with corresponding solution (i.e., tap water or 0.2% saccharin solution) and weigh them prior to conditioning procedure (baseline value).\nAll animals should use the same bottles over the course of the conditioning experiment.\n4.

Place prepared saccharin bottles (S1 to S16) into the cages at 9 a.m. in the morning session of day 6 and allow rats to drink for 15 min. Remove saccharin bottles immediately after the drinking session.",
    "11. Taking one rat after the other out of their home cages immediately after the drinking session, inject CsA (see step 9) or sterile saline intraperitoneally using a 1-ml syringe with a 26G cannula (for details about parenteral injections in laboratory rodents, see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 1995[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-bib-0007]), as follows:\n         \n“CS0-G.”: CsA (20 mg/kg)\n“US-G.”: CsA (20 mg/kg)\n“CS-G.”: CsA (20 mg/kg)\n“VEH-G.”: Sterile saline (0.9% NaCl)\n12.

Place water bottles into the cages in the morning and evening sessions during the retention interval (days 13 and 14). Allow rats to drink for 15 min. Remove and weigh all bottles after each drinking session and note consumed water volume (see step 7).\nRetrieval: Days 15 to 17\n18. Prepare injections of CsA to a final volume of 1 ml (see step 9) for the pharmacological control group “US-G.” (four animals).\n19. Place saccharin bottles into the cages of the rats of the “CS-G.” and “VEH-G.” groups in the morning session (9 a.m.) on day 15 (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-fig-0002]). Provide water bottles to the rats of the “CS0-G.” and “US-G.” groups at the same time. Allow rats to drink for 15 min.",
    "20. Inject “US-G.” animals with CsA (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally immediately after the drinking session as in step 11.\n21. Remove and weigh all bottles after each drinking session and note liquid consumption (see step 7).\n22. Repeat this procedure (steps 18 to 21) on days 16 and 17.\nTissue harvesting: Day 17\n23. Prepare anesthesia unit, guillotine, and surgical equipment for spleen harvesting. Transfer 10 ml cold HBSS to 50-ml centrifuge tubes, with one tube per animal (16 tubes, labeled 1 to 16). Keep tubes on ice to preserve the collected spleens for subsequent splenocyte isolation (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-prot-0002]).\n24. Terminate experiment 1 hr after the last CS re-exposure (day 17, 10 a.m.) and proceed with one animal after the other as follows:\n         \nExpose rat to oxygen and then anesthetize rat with isoflurane (for details, see Current Protocols article: Davis, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-bib-0006]).\nEuthanize rat by decapitation with the guillotine (for details, see Current Protocols article: Donovan & Brown, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-bib-0008]).\nOpen abdominal cavity lengthwise with sharp scissors.\nIsolate spleen and, using forceps, transfer it into one of the 50-ml centrifuge tubes filled with 10 ml cold HBSS (see step 23).\nStore spleens in HBSS on ice until all 16 spleens have been isolated and proceed with splenocyte isolation and stimulation for immunological analyses (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-prot-0002]).\nEvaluation of the conditioned taste avoidance (CTA)\n25.

Calculate mean amount of consumed water per drinking session from all water drinking sessions and set this mean water consumption as 100%.",
    "27. Evaluate relative liquid consumption in the morning sessions of the acquisition days (days 6, 9, and 12) and the retrieval days (days 15, 16, and 17) independently for each animal and each day by comparison to the mean water consumption (100%).\n28. Illustrate obtained data graphically as the CTA index (see Understanding Results).",
    "The pharmacological mechanism of CsA is based on its inhibitory effect on leukocyte proliferation via blockade of calcineurin, resulting in suppressed production of T cell–associated cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ (see details in Background Information). Thus, pharmacological CsA effects, as well as conditioned immunosuppressive effects mimicking CsA, can be investigated in tissues of the lymphatic system, such as the spleen. Therefore, isolated splenocytes from rats subjected to the taste-immune associative learning paradigm described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-prot-0001] are stimulated with anti-CD3 to induce T-cell proliferation and upregulation of the expression and release of IL-2 and IFN-γ, which are diminished by CsA.\nThe following protocol explains the process of splenocyte isolation and cultivation, stimulation with anti-CD3, and detection of stimulation-induced changes in cytokine mRNA levels and release by means of qPCR and ELISA, respectively.\nThis protocol is established for rat splenocytes but can also be adapted to cells from other lymphatic organs, such as lymph nodes.\nNOTE: All steps in this protocol require sterile technique. Additionally, use cooled media (HBSS and splenocyte cultivation medium) throughout.\nNOTE: Experiments involving PCR require extremely careful technique to prevent contamination.\nMaterials\nHBSS (Gibco Life Technologies, cat. no. 14170-088), 4°C\nIsolated spleens (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-prot-0001], step 24e)\nPharM Lyse (BioLegend, cat. no. 420301), diluted 1:10 in sterile water\nSplenocyte cultivation medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.573#cpz1573-rec-0003]), 4°C\n1 mg/ml anti-CD3, mouse anti-rat monoclonal antibody (mAb; clone G4.18, BD Pharmingen, cat. no. 554829)\nIL-2 and IFN-γ ELISA kits (e.g., Rat IL-2 Quantikine ELISA Kit, R&D Systems, cat. no.
