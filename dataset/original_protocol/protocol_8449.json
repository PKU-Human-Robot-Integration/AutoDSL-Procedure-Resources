    "All procedures were approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Obtain all necessary local approval prior to using this method.\n1. Preparation of Gustatory Disgust Unconditioned Stimulus\nUsing a micropipette with 1 mL pipette, add 80 ÂµL of denatonium benzoate solution (2.5% in water) to a mixing glass.\nUsing a measuring cylinder, carefully measure 120 mL of clean water into the mixing glass containing the denatonium benzoate solution. Stir well to mix. This produces 120.08 mL of 0.067% denatonium benzoate.\nEvenly divide the 0.067% denatonium benzoate solution into 8 clean, identical opaque cups.\n\t\nDivide the solution into cups using high-accuracy electronic scales. First, place an empty cup onto the scales and tare the scales to zero. Slowly add 0.067% denatonium benzoate solution until the scale reads 15 g. Repeat this for all 8 cups. This will give an equal amount of solution in each cup.\nAlternatively, using a 5 mL syringe, add 15 mL of 0.067% denatonium benzoate solution to the plastic cups. This will give an equal amount of solution in each cup.\nPrior to participant arrival, arrange the 8 cups of bitter drink behind a screen such that they are easily reached by the experimenter, but out of sight of the participant.\n\tNOTE: Consumption of the contents of each cup serves as a gustatory disgust unconditional stimulus (UCS) trial.\n2. Preparation of Participants and Drinking Measures",
    "Using a randomization command in a statistical package (e.g., using the 'set.seed' and 'sample' functions in R47) or a suitable online random allocation tool (e.g., random.org48, randomize participants to one of the following intervention groups: (1) Retrieval + PE (RET + PE) (2) Retrieval + No PE (RET + No PE) (3) No Retrieval + PE (No RET + PE) such that allocation to each group is equal.\nConfirm hazardous drinking with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)49. Scores >10 were considered acceptable for this study.\nAssess level of alcohol dependence via Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (SCID)50 criteria. Consider <4 items coded as threshold level as acceptable (i.e. exclude those with current alcohol use disorder). Refer to section 9 for more information on inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\tNOTE: If using the current stimulus set, participants must self-report primarily drinking beer (>60% total alcohol consumption). Exact inclusion/exclusion criteria will depend upon the nature and purpose of the study. Ensure participants are excluded if they are contraindicated for counterconditioning or exposure to alcohol cues.\nObtain informed consent from participants.\nUse an alcohol breathalyzer testing device to ensure participants are not intoxicated. If the reading is above 0.001 mg/L, re-arrange testing day or exclude the participant.\nSeat participants in front of the computer to be used to display stimuli.\nAssess state (in-the moment) craving for alcohol at baseline and again after exposure to cues with the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ-NOW)51 and alcohol consumption over the previous week at baseline and follow up (Day 8) using the Timeline Follow Back for Alcohol (TLFB)52 .",
    "Use the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES)53 to determine drinking concern and readiness to change, the Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale Revised (DPSS-R) to index propensity and sensitivity to disgust54, and the Negative Alcohol Expectancy Questionnaire (NAEQ) for negative drinking expectancies55.\nUse stimulus presentation software to present all stimuli during the memory reactivation and counterconditioning procedure (Steps 3.2.2. to 3.3.4 and and 5.1. to 6.4.).\n3. Memory Reactivation and Control Non-reactivation Procedures\nNOTE: See Figure 1 for the schematic.\nFor participants in the RET + PE and RET-no PE groups, pour 150 mL of chilled alcohol-free beer into a half-pint (284 mL) glass and place this on the table between participants and the display screen. For those in the No RET + PE group, pour 150 mL of chilled orange juice into the glass and place this on the table in front of participants.\nFor stimulus rating, present instructions and stimuli for the relevant retrieval/no retrieval procedures.\n\tNOTE: The exact instructions used in a published study26 are available upon request from the authors.\n\t\nTell participants that the glass in front of them contains beer or orange juice, as appropriate to their group. Inform them that they will consume this drink according to on-screen instructions after rating a number of pictures for pleasantness and effects on 'urge to drink' the beer or juice in front of them.\nExplain to participants that the 11-point pleasantness scale runs from -5 (extremely unpleasant) through 0 (neither pleasant nor unpleasant) to +5 (extremely pleasant). For the urge to drink scale, explain that it runs from -5 (greatly reduces urge to drink) through 0 (has no effect on urge) to +5 (greatly increases urge to drink). Instruct participants to make all ratings out loud.",
    "Tell participants to recall previous instances when they drank beer (or orange juice) to guide their ratings.\nShow participants examples of the on-screen instructions they will see when they are required to consume the drink in front of the, e.g., \"PICK UP DRINK\" in black text, \"PREPARE TO DRINK\" in blue text, and \"DRINK NOW\" in green text. Instruct the participants to only drink when they see 'DRINK NOW' written in green text.\nDeploy the reactivation/control task in the relevant manner for the stimulus presentation software being used. Program the task to present conditioned stimulus (CS) images for 10 s each in a pseudo-randomized order. This order was determined by options within the software used to program the task and stipulates no more than two consecutive presentations of Beer CS. Have the participants drink only when \"DRINK NOW\" in green text is presented.\nRecord participants' pleasantness/urge ratings in response to four beer images (alcohol cues; CS+s) and two non-alcohol rewarding drink images (neutral cues CS-s,i.e. coffee and cola) for the RET+PE and RET-no PE groups, or to four orange juice images and two CS-s for the No RET + PE group.\nIn Vivo Rating and Prediction Error Procedure\nAfter all images have been rated, direct participants' attention to the drink in front of them. Ask them to rate (the sight of) the drink itself for pleasantness and how much it affects their current urge to drink (both on the same -5 to +5 scales previously used).\n\t\t\nInstruct participants to imagine consuming the drink and rate how pleasant they think they will find it from -5 (extremely unpleasant) to 5 (extremely pleasant).",
    "Instruct participants to imagine consuming the drink and rate their current urge to consume the drink from -5 (least I have ever wanted to drink) to +5 (most I have ever wanted to drink). Note the different wording to the previous -5 to +5 urge scale.\nBegin the on-screen drinking instructions.\n\t\t\nFor all participants, present the first two screens that read \"PICK UP DRINK\" and \"PREPARE TO DRINK\", respectively. For those in RET + PE and No RET + PE groups, present the final screen that reads 'STOP! DO NOT DRINK!'. The participants must not drink the beer or orange juice, engendering negative prediction error.\nFor those in RET-no PE group, present the final screen that reads \"DRINK NOW\" and have the participants consume the beer. Display all drinking-instruction screens for 5 s.\nAfter consuming or not consuming the drink, show the screen that reads 'put down the drink and press the space bar to continue'. Ensure compliance with this instruction.\nRemove the glass from the sight of the participants.\nHave the participants rate out loud how expected/unexpected the preceding instructions were from -5 (completely unexpected) to 5 (completely expected). Write down the response.\n4. Distractor Tasks\nPlace headphones on participants.\nImmediately perform the series of short term memory tests in the order listed below.\n\t\nFirst, play one of the prose recall versions from the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test56. Elicit immediate recall by asking participants to write down as much detail about the story as they can.\nAdminister the digit span task57, following standard protocols for this task.\nAdminister the verbal and category fluency tasks58, following standard protocols for task completion (60 s to name as many exemplars as possible).\n5. Instructions for Counterconditioning Task",
    "Implement the counterconditioning task in the same stimulus presentation software as used in the retrieval/no retrieval procedure outlined in step 3, so that it can proceed from the retrieval/no retrieval procedure.\n\tNOTE: A pre-deployed version of this task that will run on most PCs most operating systems is available upon request from the authors.\nBegin the instructions for the counterconditioning task.\n\t\nInform participants that they will view a series of pictures that will be followed by different outcomes displayed on the screen, such as another picture or the words 'DRINK NOW'.\nTake the first UCS drink from behind the screen and place this in front of the participant. Inform the participant that whenever they see the words 'DRINK NOW', they must pick up the cup and drink all the liquid inside. Inform participants that the drinks may taste very bitter but are not harmful.\n\t\tNOTE: Participants must be unaware of the total number of drinks or number remaining throughout counterconditioning.\nInstruct participants that whenever they see the first (CS) image on each trial, they must rate how pleasant they find the image from -5 (extremely unpleasant) to +5 (extremely pleasant).\nHave the participants use dedicated keys on the keyboard to make their ratings. Use the keys [backslash], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] and [0] or alternative consecutive keys with stickers placed over them that read [-5], [-4], [-3], [-2], [-1], [0], [+1], [+2], [+3], [+4] and [+5], respectively. To remind participants to make this rating, have the words 'rate pleasantness now' appear on screen when the first image (CS) is displayed.",
    "Inform participants that after the outcome has occurred (UCS drink or another picture) to rate the pleasantness of the outcome on the same -5 (extremely unpleasant) to +5 (extremely pleasant) scale. This refers to either the consumption of the bitter drink UCS or presentation of the pictorial UCS.\n\t\tNOTE: The next trial in the task does not begin until these ratings are made.\nReiterate that the participants will therefore be making two ratings per trial, one for the initial picture (CS) and the second for the outcome (UCS).\nEnsure that participants understand these instructions and begin the counterconditioning task.\n6. Running Counterconditioning Task\nUse 4 beer stimuli as CS+s (the 4 beer stimuli used in the retrieval task) and two neutral stimuli as CS-s (the coffee and cola images used in the retrieval/no retrieval task). Prepare three UCS \"Types\". The first type: \"Gustatory UCS\" consists of the words \"DRINK NOW\" appearing on screen and the participants consuming the cup of bitter liquid placed in front of them. The second type: \"Pictorial UCS\", consists of presentation of one of the disgusting images detailed below. The third type: \"Neutral UCS\" consists of the neural images detailed below.\n\t\nPair two of the beer CS+s (designated the \"Drink CS+s\") with the gustatory UCSs (these are labelled \"gustatory\" in the \"UCS Type\" column of Table 1). Following these CSs, let the words \"DRINK NOW\" appear on screen and ask participants to consume the cups of bitter liquid placed in front of them. Pair two (designated \"Pictorial CS+s\") with visual disgust-inducing UCSs from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; three images: 9301.jpg, 9325.jpg, 9405.jpg, and a fourth sourced from the internet depicting a wound on a human foot that is infested with maggots; these CSs are labelled \"Pictorial\" in Table 1).",
    "NOTE: Allocation of beer CS to outcome should be random and made prior to beginning data collection. The allocation of CS to outcome type should then be kept constant across all participants. The trials and trial sequence are identical across all experimental groups. The outcome UCSs for the neutral CS-s are neutral-valence IAPS images (1020.jpg and 1021.jpg). All pairings are on a 100% reinforcement schedule.\nPair each of the two pictorial CS+s with each visual disgust UCS image once (8 trials total). Pair each of the Gustatory CS+s with the words 'DRINK NOW' and consumption of the gustatory disgust UCSs (bitter drink) four times (8 trials total). Pair each of the neutral CS-s with the neutral UCS pictures four times (8 trials total). Therefore, perform a total of 24 trials.\nBegin the counterconditioning task by pressing a dedicated key (spacebar) once the participant understands that they are required to make two ratings per trial: one for the initial picture (CS) and one for the outcome (UCS).\nUse a pseudo-randomized trial order for all participants. A working example is given in in Table 1, with all 24 trials completed in a single sitting.\n\tNOTE: This order ensures that the same UCSs does not occur in consecutive trials and that no more than two trials of the same CS occur consecutively. However, an alternative trial ordering that fulfills these requirements may be used as long as it is consistent across participants.\n\t\nHave the participants in the No RET + PE group rate the four beer CS+s for pleasantness once, immediately prior to beginning counterconditioning.",
    "NOTE: This is to provide baseline rating in this group and to ensure that the volume of pre-exposure to the CSs to be counterconditioned is identical between groups. It is not necessary to do this in RET + no PE or RET + PE, as they have already rated the beer images.\nTake the first UCS drink from behind the screen and place this in front of the participant in preparation for the \"DRINK NOW\" instructions.\nPresent the first (CS) image in the sequence from Table 1 for 6 s. Have the participants rate how pleasant they find the image within the 6 s from -5 (extremely unpleasant) to +5 (extremely pleasant) when the first (CS) image on each trial is presented.\nHave the participants use dedicated keys on the keyboard to make their ratings. Use the keys [backslash], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] and [0] or alternative consecutive keys with stickers placed over them that read [-5], [-4], [-3], [-2], [-1], [0], [+1], [+2], [+3], [+4] and [+5], respectively. To remind participants to make this rating, have the words 'rate pleasantness now' appear on screen when the first image (CS) is displayed.\nPresent the \"DRINK NOW\" instructions for 6 s and have the participant pick up the cup and consume the liquid. Ensure the entire amount of the denatonium benzoate solution is consumed on each gustatory UCS counterconditioning trial. As soon as one drink is finished, remove the empty cup and replace with the next 15 mL cup of denatonium benzoate solution.\nHave the participants rate the pleasantness of the gustatory UCS outcome on the same -5 (extremely unpleasant) to +5 (extremely pleasant) scale used to rate the CS after they have consumed the entire 15 mL.",
    "NOTE: There is no time limit for the UCS ratings. Once the rating is made, a single trial is complete.\nPresent the next CS in the sequence (a Neutral picture, CS-1 in Table 1) for 6 s. Have the participants rate how pleasant they find the image within this period using the response keys for -5 (extremely unpleasant) to +5 (extremely pleasant), as previously.\nContinue with presentation of the remaining 22 trials.\n\t\tNOTE: The entire counterconditioning task takes approximately 10 min.\nUpon completion, have the participants consume two squares of milk chocolate to remove the residual bitter taste of the denatonium benzoate solution. Instruct them to allow the chocolate to melt on their tongue.\n7. One-Week Follow Up Measures\nSchedule this session for one week after the retrieval/counterconditioning procedure.\n\t\nTake an alcohol breathalyzer reading. If reading is above 0.001, re-arrange testing day or exclude participant. Record if a positive reading (>0.001 mg/L) is obtained.\nPresent all CSs used in the counterconditioning task plus three novel pictures of beer and three novel pictures of wine (10 alcohol images in total) for 10 s each in a pseudorandomized order. Have the participants rate pleasantness from -5 (extremely unpleasant) to +5 (extremely pleasant) and effects on urge to drink beer from -5 (greatly reduces urge) to + 5 (greatly increases urge) for every image. Record their responses on paper.\n\tNOTE: Novel picture ratings are taken to assess generalization of effects within the class of beer stimuli and to other types of alcohol.\nAdminister the ACQ-NOW49, alcohol TLFB52 for the previous week, DPSS-R54, and SOCRATES53.\n\tNOTE: The same follow-up measures can be be used repeatedly for additional, extended follow up.\n8. Dot-probe Task (Optional)",
    "If access to an eye-tracking set-up is available, complete an attentional bias dot-probe task using the images used in the counterconditioning task at this stage.\n\tNOTE: The details of this task are given in Das et al.28 and are not given here. This task is available upon request from the authors.\n9. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nUse the following inclusion criteria for hazardous drinkers: Hazardous drinking (defined as a score >10 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, but <4 items coded as 3 on the SCID), consumption of >3 units for females, >4 units for males on at least 4 days per week (8 g pure alcohol/unit), fluent English, and normal or corrected-to-normal color vision.\nUse the following exclusion criteria: ages <18 and >65, past or current diagnosis of drug or alcohol use disorders, any currently medicated mental health issues, any current major physical health issue, current pregnancy, or breastfeeding.\n\tNOTE: Exact inclusion and exclusion criteria may vary depending upon the population under test using this procedure.\n10. Data Pre-Processing and Analysis59\nFor the purposes of analyzing CS ratings, calculate four epochs for each CS Type during counterconditioning. For each participant, this is achieved by simply taking the average of each two consecutive trials of each type. For example, in the order given in Table 1, average the ratings of Trial 1 and Trial 3 to get the first epoch for Beer CS+1.\n\tNOTE: This will produce 4 \"Trial\" levels for each stimulus for the counterconditioning rating data. This is done to smooth out trial-to-trial variation in ratings that occur due to spurious order and expectancy effects.\nAssess all data for normality, homogeneity of variance and sphericity (for repeated-measures with k>2 comparisons).",
    "Where homogeneity of variance is violated in one-way analysis of variance, use Welch's F test. Where sphericity is violated, use the Huynh-Feldt or Greenhouse Geisser correction, as appropriate to the level of epsilon56. Winsorize any outliers >3 s.d. away from the sample mean for that variable to a score 3 s.d. from the mean. Run analyses with and without this procedure to assess sensitivity of results to the procedure and report any divergence.\nAssess whether there are any differences over counterconditioning in responding to the Gustatory CS+s and Pictorial CS+s. If not, collapse the two CS types for counterconditioning analysis. If there are differences, include CS type as an extra level in analyses of counterconditioning data."
