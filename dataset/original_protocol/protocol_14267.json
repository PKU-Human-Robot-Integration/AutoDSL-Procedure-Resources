    "This study was performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Seoul National University Hospital (14-0148-C1A1), which is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.\nNOTE: The experiments were performed on Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats of 7 - 8 weeks old (200/250 g). Each animal was acclimatized to the laboratory conditions for 1 week prior to the start of the experiment. The animals were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with a constant 12-h:12-h light:dark cycle with free access to food and water.\n1. Labyrinthectomy\nCover the autoclaved surgical instruments with a sterile pad. Disinfect the operating area with 70% ethanol. Use a sterile drape and maintain sterile conditions during the surgery.\nWear a gown, mask (to cover nose and mouth), cap (to cover head), and a pair of sterile gloves. The surgical instruments must only come in contact with sterile surfaces.\nInject tiletamine-zolazepam anesthetic (40 mg/kg body weight) intramuscularly into the medial thigh or intraperitoneally, and xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight) intramuscularly or intraperitoneally.\n\tNOTE: Other modes of general anesthesia, including isoflurane inhalation, can also be used.\nPlace the rat on a warming pad (initially set at 42 °C). Apply lubricant eye ointment to both eyes of the rat to prevent eye dryness while under anesthesia.\nPlace the rat on its right side. Shave the fur in the surgical area with hair clippers. Disinfect the site with 70% ethanol.\nInject 1% lidocaine hydrochloride subcutaneously into the left retroauricular area.",
    "Using a scalpel blade #15, make a ~5.0 cm retroauricular incision. Separate the muscle and fascia to expose the external auditory canal with Iris scissors (Figure 1A). Slightly open the external auditory canal using the blade #15 or the Iris scissors (Figure 1B). Widely expose the tympanic membrane (Figure 2A).\nUnder a microscope (7.5X or 12.5X), remove the tympanic membrane and the ossicles with the exception of the stapes, using the forceps. Detach the muscles on the lambdoidal ridge with the blade #15 or the Iris scissors (Figure 2B).\nUsing a drill at low speed (<3000 rpm) with a diamond bur (2.1 or 1.4 mm), drill the tympanic bulla bone around the point of exit of the facial nerve (Figure 3A). Identify the stapedial artery. Take care not to damage the stapedial artery during the drilling process.\nContinue drilling the vestibule superior to the stapedial artery and expose the round window and the bony lateral semicircular canal. Open the lateral semicircular canal near its ampulla. Continue drilling in the plane of the lateral semicircular canal and drill the ampulla of the superior semicircular canal. \nAspirate the contents of the vestibule using a 18-G or 22-G needle. Inject and aspirate 1 cm3 of 100% ethanol 3x.\nClose the muscles and the skin in two layers with simple interrupted sutures.\nDo not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Keep the rat warm until it wakens using a heating pad or a heat lamp. After awakening, move the rat to an individual cage in a room featuring the usual environmental conditions.",
    "Administer antibiotics (e.g., Cefazoline 20 mg/kg, trimethoprim-sulfonamide 100 µL subcutaneously, or penicillin 300,000 IU) as needed on day 1; an analgesic (not an opioid; e.g., Metacam 2 mg/kg, Carprofen 5 mg/kg subcutaneously) can also be given.\n2. Sham Surgery\nFor the sham surgery as a control, perform the same surgical and post-surgical procedures (as per section 1), including the exposure of the external auditory canal and the tympanic membrane (step 1.7), the removal of the tympanic membrane and the ossicles, and the detachment of the muscles on the lambdoidal ridge (step 1.8), but do not open the semicircular canal or inject ethanol.\n3. Check the Loss of Vestibular Function\nNOTE: The loss of vestibular function can be evaluated using either behavioral or vestibular function tests.13,17,18 Behavioral tests include the evaluation of postural asymmetry and nystagmus.\nIdentify postural asymmetry which includes spontaneous or evoked barrel-rolling, falling to the left side, or moving around while leaning toward the lesioned side18. See Video 1.\nIdentify nystagmus by a visual inspection of voluntary eye movement. When spontaneous nystagmus is absent in the resting state, puff air gently over the head of the animal18.
