    "Virus production can be achieved through different means depending on the desired experimental goal. These methods will yield viral particles of varying levels of homogeneity and purity depending on the virus, the type of producer cells, and the medium used. Here, we produce viruses by three common methods and analyze them by light scatter and fluorescence (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0003]). In particular, we produce virus by transfecting cells with a virus-expressing plasmid, by harvesting the supernatant of an infected cell population, or by harvesting virus in the supernatant of infected cell clones (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0001]). Detailed methods to produce virus and the virus expression plasmids used here have been described elsewhere (Maltseva & Langlois, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0015], Renner, Tang, Burger, & Langlois, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0017]; Tang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0019]). In our experiments, we used a replicative murine leukemia virus (MLV) that expresses an envelope-superfolder GFP fusion protein (Env-sfGFP) on its surface (Maltseva & Langlois, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0015], Renner et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0017]; Tang et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0018]; Tang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0019]). Fusing the envelope glycoprotein with a GFP fluorescent reporter makes these viruses intrinsically fluorescent and easily discernible from background noise by FVM. Additionally, these viruses can also be labeled by fluorophore-conjugated antibodies directed against host-derived surface proteins or against the Env-sfGFP fusion protein found on the viral envelope, as we have demonstrated in Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0004] (Maltseva & Langlois, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0015], Renner et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0017]; Tang et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0018]). As shown in Figure 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0001], viruses produced by all three methods are resolved with different efficiencies by both light scatter and fluorescence (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0003]).",
    "Although viruses produced by all three methods exhibit a homogenous light scatter and fluorescence intensity distribution, virus produced from a chronically infected clonal cell line displayed the most monodisperse population for both properties and had lower background fluorescence compared to virus from the other methods of virus production (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0001] and 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0001]). Various factors can contribute to the increase in background fluorescence levels, such as the type of medium used, the type of transfection reagent, and EVs that are concomitantly released by the cells (Tang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0019]).",

    "3a. Prepare transfection mix by adding 100 µl serum-free DMEM and 3 µl GeneJuice Transfection Reagent to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube for each well to be transfected.\n4a. Vortex mixture thoroughly and let sit for 5 min at room temperature.\n5a. Add viral plasmid of interest and mix by gentle pipetting.\nFor this assay, we added 1 μg plasmid DNA coding for MLV to the sample. We produced wild-type MLV with no GFP reporter (MLV) and MLV expressing Env-sfGFP (MLVsfGFP). Although both viruses can be resolved by light scatter by FVM, MLVsfGFP expresses a GFP fluorescent reporter on its surface, allowing viral particles to be resolved by both light scatter and fluorescence. Both the MLV and the MLVsfGFP plasmids, encoding a replicative Moloney-MLV, are described in detail elsewhere (Renner et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0017]).\n6a.

Harvest supernatant from the cells and pass through a 450-nm Acrodisc sterile syringe filter attached to a 10-ml syringe and into a 15-ml conical tube.\nVirus-containing supernatants can be stored for up to 2 weeks at 4°C for infection of cells (see step 3b) or for FVM analysis (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0003]).\nProduction of virus from an infected cell population (single-round infection)",
    "1b. Seed 6.0 × 105 NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells in 2 ml complete DMEM per well in a 6-well plate.\n2b. Incubate overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2.\n3b. Remove existing medium from the wells carefully, without disturbing the cells, and infect cells using supernatant from 293T cells transfected with the virus expression vector as in steps 1a to 12a.\nThe volume of virus-containing supernatant that is added to cells will depend on whether single or multiple retroviral integrations are desired per cell. Multiple integrations will result in a higher yield of released virus, but the cells may exhibit cytopathic effects and stunted growth kinetics. To ensure that most infected cells harbor a single retrovirus integration, a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of <0.5 should be used. This corresponds to infection of <40% of the total cell population. For cells that are difficult to infect, virus-containing supernatants collected from transfected 293T cells can be concentrated by ultracentrifugation [Optima L-XP series ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. 337922) with rotor type 70 Ti (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. 337922) and 70 Ti rotor tubes (polycarbonate tubes and lids; Beckman Coulter, cat. no. 3355618) for 3 hr at 100,000 × g at 4°C, and resuspension of the pellet in a lower volume, such as 1 ml complete DMEM. In our work, we infected the target cells using an MOI of 10 to obtain maximum virus yield.\n4b. Incubate for 24 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2 and then wash cells twice with 2 ml DPBS for 30 s each to remove input virus.\n5b. Add 2 ml of 200-nm-filtered phenol red–free complete DMEM.\n6b. Incubate cells for an additional 48 hr at 37°C, 5% CO2. Validate infection efficiency by evaluating GFP expression under an inverted fluorescence microscope or by flow cytometry.",
    "7b. Harvest supernatant from the cells and pass through a 450-nm Acrodisc sterile syringe filter and into a 15-ml conical tube.\nVirus-containing supernatants can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks for infection of cells (see step 3b) or for FVM analysis (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0003]).\nProduction of virus by chronically infected cell clones\n1c. Carry out steps 1b to 6b, with the modification that 2.5 × 106 NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells are seeded in 10 ml complete DMEM in a 10-cm dish and are infected at various MOIs (0.5, 1, and 2, yielding ∼90% infection).\nComplete DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) is used for optimal cell growth.\n2c. Harvest cells from each plate and identify and isolate infected cells expressing GFP with a FACS instrument, dispensing one cell in each well of a 96-well plate (one plate per MOI condition) pre-filled with 200 µl complete DMEM.\nIn our assay, infected cells were resuspended in DPBS at 1 × 106 cells/ml prior to sorting, and the cells expressing the highest levels of GFP were gated and sorted. However, each cell sort should be optimized according to the FACS instrument used and the flow core facility guidelines. Cossarizza et al. (2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0006]) highlight helpful considerations for serial cell sorting by flow cytometry.\n3c. Incubate cells at 37°C at 5% CO2, and allow cells to expand.\nCell growth should be checked every 2 to 3 days. Clones should expand within 7 to 14 days, depending on the growth rate of the cell.\n4c. When confluent, transfer all cells from each positive well (i.e., expressing GFP) to a well of a 24-well plate containing 0.5 ml complete DMEM. Incubate cells for 3 days or until confluent.",
    "5c. When confluent, transfer all cells from each positive well to a well of a 6-well plate containing 3 ml complete DMEM per well for further expansion.\n6c. Dispense some cells from each clonal expansion into a FACS tube (0.4 × 106 cells per 0.4 ml DPBS) and analyze GFP expression by flow cytometry. Identify clones with the highest GFP fluorescence intensity for further expansion and for downstream analysis of released viruses by FVM (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0003]).\nAt this point, cells can be cultured further for downstream application, or cell stocks can be aliquoted and cryopreserved as described by the manufacturer.\n7c. Harvest cell supernatants from GFP-positive clones and pass through a 450-nm Acrodisc sterile syringe filter into a 15-ml conical tube.\nVirus produced from a chronically infected clonal cell line displayed the most monodisperse population in both light scatter and fluorescence compared to virus produced from other methods (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0001]). Thus, for the purpose of this protocol, one stably infected clone (#6), as described in detail in Renner et al. (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0017]), was selected for all downstream viral analyses demonstrated in Basic Protocols 2 to 5 and the Support Protocol.\n8c. Store cell supernatants at 4°C until ready for FVM analysis (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0003]).\nVirus-containing supernatants can be stored up to 2 weeks at 4°C for infection of cells (see step 3b) or for FVM analysis (see Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0003]).",
    "Because the viral particles used here (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0001]) are very close to the limits of detection for both light scatter and fluorescence for most commercial flow cytometers, an appropriate experimental design and instrument setup are critical to ensure viral detection and resolution at the single-particle level (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0003]). This protocol outlines the necessary steps for fluorescence quantification, relying on the principles for light scatter and fluorescence calibration described in a Current Protocols article by Welsh & Jones (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0025]). For accurate, reproducible, and standardized data reporting, it is crucial to determine the limit of the assay's and instrument's sensitivity for light scatter and fluorescence measurements and to calibrate these values using standardized reference materials. For this purpose, light scatter calibration is performed using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-certified standard reference beads. Fluorescence calibration and data reporting in quantitative units (or standard units) such as molecules of equivalent soluble fluorophore (MESF) or equivalent reference fluorophore (ERF) are appropriate for fluorescence intensity conversion from arbitrary units (a.u.) (Welsh et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0026]). Reporting of experimental data in standard units can be achieved by using FCMPASS software, which calibrates light scatter and fluorescence measurements using commercially available reference standards and enables data reporting to conform with the MIFlowCyt-EV framework (Welsh et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0026]). As such, this calibration enables an estimation of particle diameter, using the known RIs of the particles, and relative antigen quantitation, which facilitates the comparison of data between experiments and research groups. The protocol below outlines how to prepare fluorescence calibration materials for FCS file calibration and how to evaluate instrument sensitivity and performance. To report data in standard units, calibrated files are generated using FCMPASS software, which plots the acquired signal intensity in a.u.",
    "using the manufacturer's predicted values for each bead population and performs a least-squares regression. Figures 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0002] and 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0002] respectively display the light scattering and fluorescence features of BD Quantibrite Phycoerythrin (PE) fluorescence and polystyrene NIST-traceable size reference beads used for calibration. Figure 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0002] shows that the data points for the beads fall within the “good fit” range for scatter modeling using FCMPASS software. Both calibration curves display a high correlation between acquired and predicted values (Fig. 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0002]). This close correlation is essential to be able to convert fluorescence intensity values into molecule equivalents and report fluorescence measurements in standard units such as PE MESF, as used in this protocol. To ensure consistent detection of individual virus particles, this protocol additionally outlines how to validate that viral particles are interrogated one at a time in the flow cytometer. Simultaneous detection of several particles is a phenomenon called “swarm detection or coincidence,” where the combined interrogation of multiple particles can lead to a decrease in total events but a concurrent increase in fluorescence intensity (van der Pol, van Gemert, Sturk, Nieuwland, & van Leeuwen, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0023]). In order to minimize coincidence of viral particles and determine an optimal sample concentration for acquisition, a range of serially diluted virus-containing samples is analyzed and quantified.",

Set up flow cytometer settings according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the assay being calibrated.",
    "The cytometer that we utilized for our study was the Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX S with a 405-nm laser for the side-scatter light (SSC-H) trigger parameter (1500-a.u. threshold) with a 405/10-nm bandpass filter, a 561-nm laser for the PE fluorophore with a 561-580/30-nm bandpass filter, a 488-nm laser for the GFP fluorophore with a 488-525/40-nm bandpass filter, and a 640-nm laser with a 640-670/30-nm bandpass filter. The gain for each detector is as follows: 195, 1600, 3000, and 1200 a.u., respectively. All samples were acquired at the lowest sampling rate (10 μl per 60 s). Volumetric calibrations were validated by weight using the CytExpert calibration tool. Detailed information on instrument optics, light scatter, and fluorescence calibration is summarized in the FCMPASS report in the Supporting Information, File 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#support-information-section].",
    "Selection of the trigger parameter is dependent on the aim of the experiment and the type of flow cytometer. Light scatter or fluorescence can be chosen as the trigger parameter; each one has its own benefits and caveats. In particular, the selection of light scatter enables detection of all particles, including possible contaminants in the sample analyzed, resulting in more events being acquired. Processing a larger number of events may impact the event rate, electronic abort rate, and file size (Tang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0019]). In contrast, using fluorescence as the trigger parameter will tailor detection to only fluorescently labeled particles whose signal exceeds the designated threshold for the sample acquired. It is recommended to set a trigger threshold using the pulse height parameter to allow for the limit of detection to be reported in calibrated units (see Current Protocols article; Welsh & Jones, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0025]). As such, light scatter analysis enables evaluation of all particles within a sample. This is especially useful if the goal of the experiment is to characterize a heterogeneous viral population, where virions express varying levels of light scattering or cannot be efficiently directly labeled. In contrast, fluorescence analysis is suitable when staining is efficient or when viruses express a fluorescent reporter protein. This can allow for the precise enumeration of labeled particles and, under optimal conditions, the quantification of the labeled target antigen. In either scenario, the instrument should be carefully calibrated for the functional range of detection of the parameter being analyzed. This can be achieved by running NIST-traceable size or fluorescence reference beads to determine the instrument's sensitivity and dynamic range.\n2. Filter DPBS through a 100-nm Acrodisc sterile syringe filter attached to a 10-ml syringe and into a 50-ml conical tube.",
    "100-nm-filtered DPBS is used for all the downstream analysis throughout this protocol in order to reduce possible background noise resulting from small-particle contaminants.\n3. Run a DPBS-only control in a FACS tube on the flow cytometer.\nThis control will assess the instrument opto-electronic noise as well as establish the baseline for background noise. It can be used as the control to determine the threshold of detection. Running this sample periodically throughout the experiment will allow one to monitor the cleanliness and stability of the instrument's fluidics following the processing of multiple samples. The 405-SSC parameter plotted against time is helpful to evaluate the consistency of the event rate during sample acquisition.\n4. Add 500 µl of 100-nm-filtered DPBS from step 2 to a tube of BD Quantibrite PE beads.\nEach tube contains lyophilized beads that are conjugated to PE at four levels of fluorescence intensity. Many of the available commercial beads exhibit much brighter fluorescence intensities compared to enveloped viruses. Regardless of this caveat, fluorescence reference beads still constitute suitable fluorescence standards needed for instrument calibration, quality control, and extrapolation of surface antigen numbers on viruses.\n5. Let sit for ∼3 min until beads at the bottom of tube are fully dissolved and then vortex tube thoroughly.\n6. Run sample until the desired number of beads is recorded.\nThe minimum number is 5000 bead events (see Current Protocols article; Welsh & Jones, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0025]).",
    "First plot the FSC and SSC area parameters against each other. The beads should be visible on the plot and clustered tightly together. The gain should be adjusted for each parameter to optimize resolution, similar to adjusting the acquisition settings when running cells. By first gating on the singlet bead population using the FSC-A vs. SSC-A plot, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) in a.u. of each bead population can then be determined by plotting the gated population using counts vs. PE-A in FlowJo software (v10.7.1) or other processing software. The obtained values can be inputted alongside the manufacturer's reference values in FCMPASS software, which will add the calibration information to the samples run during the same session, enabling reporting of the data in standardized units and tracking the instrument's longitudinal performance.\n7. Once reference beads have been acquired on the flow cytometer, convert raw FCS files into calibrated FCS files using FCMPASS software, which allows reporting of data in standard units following the steps described in the protocol by Welsh & Jones (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0025]) for fluorescence and light scatter calibration and applying calibration to FCS files.",

The former metric was calculated based on the conversion of light scatter intensity to estimated diameter using NIST-traceable size calibration reference beads while considering the effective RI of the particle analyzed and the collection angle of the instrument (see Current Protocols article; Welsh & Jones, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0025]). Fluorescence intensity is presented in units of median PE MESF using BD Quantibrite PE beads as explained above. Robust standard deviation (rSD), instead of standard deviation (SD), was used in order to omit skewing of SD by outlying events. Additionally, FCMPASS software provides an output report with details of the cytometer's limit of detection that is dependent on the composition and RI of the particle analyzed (i.e., polystyrene vs. silica beads) (Supporting Information, File 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#support-information-section]). For example, according to this generated output report, the following are the lowest diameter sizes of different particle materials that can be detected by our instrument: 59.1-nm polystyrene particle, 80.3-nm silica particle, and viral particles of 82 nm given an RI of 1.45.\n8. Filter 3 to 5 ml virus-containing supernatant from chronically infected NIH 3T3 cell clone (#6) cells (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0001], steps 1c to 8c) through a 450-nm Acrodisc sterile syringe filter and into a 15-ml conical tube.\n9. Perform serial dilutions of virus-containing supernatant in 100-nm-filtered DPBS (see step 2) directly in FACS tubes and vortex.",
    "When performing serial dilutions, pipetting volumes >5 μl is recommended to decrease pipetting variability. To achieve a 1:125 dilution, 8 μl viral supernatant is added to 992 μl of 100-nm-filtered DPBS. Begin analyzing the most dilute sample and proceed to the most concentrated sample. This will reduce the risk of contaminating the flow cytometer with viruses and small particles that could affect measurements in the most diluted samples. If the abort rate exceeds the manufacturer's recommendation, in our case 4000 events per second, the sample being run is likely too concentrated, which can lead to coincidence. Performing serial dilutions is a commonly used method to favor single-particle acquisition and reduce the possibility of swarm detection. Evidence of single-particle acquisition can be demonstrated when the measured viral particle count linearly reflects the dilution factor while light scatter intensity or fluorescence signal is maintained constant (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0003]) (Groot Kormelink et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0009]; Tang et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0019]; Welsh et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0026]). As shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0003], particle count per 10 µl of sample volume linearly decreased with higher dilution while median GFP intensity measurement remained linear. This indicates that there was little particle coincidence under our experimental conditions across dilutions tested. For the purposes of our viral analysis, all samples were diluted at a 1:500 dilution factor.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d6994e19-df4c-473d-b7df-eb7dbf7d46c7/cpz1368-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Sample dilution and assessment of coincidence. (A) Analysis of serially diluted virus samples to determine the efficiency of single viral particle detection. Plots are shown from left to right in order of decreasing dilution. Indicated in red are the particle counts in each gate. (B) Serial dilution plot of viral particle concentration (left axis) and FITC median fluorescence (right axis) as a function of the dilution factor. The virus concentration and MFI were calculated from the viral particle count and signal within the red gate from (A), respectively. All experimental controls were run at the same acquisition settings (flow rate of 10 µl/min, same trigger threshold and gain) and during the same data acquisition session as the other samples.\n10. Run samples and gate on viral population, which should be distinguishable from the background noise.\nVirus populations can be resolved or distinguished from background noise by their characteristic light scatter profile. The highly controlled and consistent nature of viral capsid assembly normally results in a homogenous population, as illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0001]. If the virus is fluorescent or fluorescently stained with dyes or antibodies, it can be additionally resolved from background by using fluorescent channels (Fig. 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0001]). By gating on the viral population, the original concentration of a sample can be determined by accounting for the dilution factor and the flow rate.\nFor example, if the sample was diluted 1:500 in a final volume of 1000 µl, as shown in Figure 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0003], and acquired at flow rate of 10 µl/min, with 17,856 particles detected in the viral gate, the concentration of virus in the supernatant is as follows:\n         formula:\n\\begin{eqnarray*} Virus{\\rm{\\;}}concentration &amp;=&amp; \\frac{{particles{\\rm{\\;}}in{\\rm{\\;}}the{\\rm{\\;}}gate}}{{volume{\\rm{\\;}}acquired{\\rm{\\;}}by{\\rm{\\;}}the{\\rm{\\;}}cytometer{\\rm{\\;}}}} \\times {\\rm{\\;}}volume{\\rm{\\;}}of{\\rm{\\;}}sample{\\rm{\\;}} \\\\ &amp;&amp; \\times\\; dilution{\\rm{\\;}}factor\\\\ {\\rm{Virus\\;concentration}} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{{17,856{\\rm{\\;}}particles}}{{10{\\rm{\\;}}\\mu l{\\rm{\\;}}}}{\\rm{\\;}} \\times {\\rm{\\;}}1000{\\rm{\\;}}\\mu l{\\rm{\\;}} \\times {\\rm{\\;}}500\\\\ Virus{\\rm{\\;}}concentration &amp;=&amp; 8.9{\\rm{\\;}} \\times {\\rm{\\;}}{10^8}{\\rm{\\;}}particles/ml \\end{eqnarray*}",
    "Analyzing virus particles (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0001]) by flow cytometry is challenging due to the fact that they are often near the limit of detection for both light scatter and fluorescence for most commercial flow cytometers. Consequently, an appropriate experimental design and instrument setup are critical to enable virus detection and resolution from background noise before pursuing downstream analyses. This protocol covers the key issues that should be considered to ensure consistent detection and resolution of the virus population at the single-particle level. Similar to the controls outlined in the MIFlowCyt-EV framework for reporting in EV studies, key experimental controls are required for virus detection and quantification studies (Welsh et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0026]). These controls include buffer only (to evaluate instrument background noise) and supernatant collected from uninfected cells (to evaluate the possible presence of EVs). To evaluate changes in light scatter or fluorescence signals, these experimental controls should all be run at the same acquisition settings (flow rate, trigger threshold, and gain) and during the same session for all samples. Given that several factors influence virus production between experiments, serial dilutions are recommended prior to each experiment in order to determine the optimal particle concentration for acquisition, as illustrated in step 9 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0002].\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0002])\nBuffer control (100-nm-filtered DPBS; see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0002], step 2)\nSupernatant from uninfected control NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells treated under same conditions as chronically infected NIH 3T3 cell clone (#6) cells (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0001], steps 1c to 8c)\n1.

Acquire assay-control and virus-containing samples diluted in DPBS on the cytometer.\n6. Gate on viral population, which should be distinguishable from the background noise.",
    "Virus populations can be resolved from background noise by their characteristic light scatter profile (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0001]). If the virus is fluorescent or fluorescently stained with dyes or antibodies, it can be additionally resolved from background using appropriate fluorescent channels. As shown in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0004], the virus population displays highly monodisperse fluorescence (red gate) and scatter (green gate) profiles that are not present in the buffer-only (DPBS) or supernatant assay controls. Here, we compared wild-type MLV (non-fluorescent) and MLVsfGFP that expresses Env-sfGFP on its surface. Particles in the green gate for DPBS are likely salt aggregates and contaminants released from the flow cytometer fluidics, whereas particles in the green gate of the supernatant control may additionally contain EVs released from the cells. The concentration of intact viral particles in an MLV and MLVsfGFP stock sample was extrapolated from the particle count of the green or red gate, respectively (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-tbl-0001]). Here, we report MLV and MLVsfGFP in units of median diameter (nm) and their approximate size at 109.8 ± 6.8 nm and 120.3 ± 4.5 nm, respectively (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-tbl-0001]). This parameter was calibrated based on the conversion of light scatter intensity to estimated diameter using NIST-traceable size calibration reference beads, considering the effective RI of MLV (estimated at 1.45) and the collection angle of the instrument (Ma et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0014]), as shown in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/159caf40-15f3-4a43-a3f3-3db5a3e9e3c6/cpz1368-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

    "This protocol outlines the experimental setup for single-color virus staining. Characterization of the antigenic composition and abundance is predominantly achieved by fluorescence quantification. However, the smaller surface area and number of proteins available for staining on the viral surface necessitates a careful consideration of the choice of fluorophore(s) used and the optimal antibody concentration (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0005]). Determining the optimal staining antibody concentration using a titration is especially crucial to resolve dimly stained virus particles from unstained populations and background noise, as illustrated in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0005]. In this protocol, we optimized the antibody staining conditions using a PE-conjugated antibody that targets the highly expressed Env-sfGFP fusion protein. However, viruses can be labeled by fluorophore-conjugated antibodies directed against host-derived surface proteins or viral glycoproteins found on the viral envelope (Maltseva & Langlois, 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0015]; Renner et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0017]; Tang et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0018]). Similarly to cell staining procedures, attention should be given to the initial virus concentration, antibody incubation time, and final antibody concentration (Cossarizza et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-bib-0006]). As previously mentioned, a set of experimental controls stained under the same conditions as the virus samples should be run during the same data acquisition session in order to evaluate changes in light scatter and fluorescence profiles (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0005]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/823f1b1e-d7e6-4699-94eb-e561a6957c60/cpz1368-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",

    "A master mixture can be made if several samples are to be stained with the same antibody. Extra solution should be prepared to account for potential losses during pipetting. Stained experimental controls are crucial to evaluate background fluorescence. In this assay, we used wild-type MLV as the control virus, as it is nearly identical to MLVsfGFP but does not express the target antigen for the staining (i.e., GFP, which is used to evaluate nonspecific binding with our antibodies, as shown in Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0005]). Similarly, an isotype control can be used to evaluate nonspecific binding if a suitable control virus is not available. DPBS and supernatant collected from uninfected cells were simultaneously labeled as assay controls. In our study, we found that 0.10 μg/ml was the optimal final staining concentration for the anti-GFP PE monoclonal antibody when mixed 1:1 with virus-containing supernatant adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 109 viral particles/ml.

Centrifuge tube of anti-GFP PE monoclonal antibody for 10 min at 17,000 × g, 4°C, in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge.\n3. Perform a five-fold titration of the fluorophore-conjugated antibody in 100-nm-filtered DPBS.\nWe first analyzed the antibody concentration in the range of 0.02 to 2.5 µg/ml. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the antibody staining concentration to use as a starting point. Determination of the optimal concentration will also depend on the viral particle concentration (see step 1), the specificity of the antibody, and the presence of potential non-viral particles that can be stained and contribute to an increase in background fluorescence level, among other variables. The recommended range varies depending on the fluorophore, expected antigen density, and fluorophore-to-antigen ratio. We recommend titrating the antibody staining concentration first five-fold to determine the optimal concentration that maximizes the assay's dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, and stain index, as shown in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0005]. The optimal antibody concentration calculated here is estimated at 0.10 µg/ml. At this concentration, the particle count for MLVsfGFP is maximal and background noise and nonspecific binding are minimal compared to values at the higher staining concentrations (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0005]).",
    "4. Mix equal volumes of supernatant containing virus that expresses target protein of interest with supernatant containing control virus that does not express the target protein.\nAlternatively, an isotype-control antibody at the same concentration can be used to evaluate the effect of nonspecific binding on background signal.\n5. Add 50 µl virus-containing supernatant from step 4 to 50 µl antibody mixture from step 3.\n6. Perform steps 5 to 15 of Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0004].\n7. Gate on positively stained and unstained populations to obtain the MFI.\n8. Determine highest separation between the positively and negatively labeled populations (stain index).\nThe stain index can be calculated as follows:\n         formula:\n\\begin{eqnarray*} Stain \\; index = \\frac{{MFI\\;of\\;postive\\;population\\; - \\;MFI\\;of\\;negative\\;population}}{{SD\\;of\\;negative\\;population}} \\end{eqnarray*}\n9. Once a five-fold titration has been evaluated, repeat steps 4 to 8 with a more narrow incremental titration in the range of the optimal concentration determined in step 8.\nBased on the five-fold antibody titration, a narrower incremental range of staining concentration can be subsequently performed to determine the highest separation (stain index) between the positively and negatively labeled virus populations (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0006]). Again, equal numbers of MLV and MLVsfGFP particles are mixed and stained to calculate the stain index. Following the narrower increment titration, we confirmed that an antibody concentration of 0.10 µg/ml appears to be optimal under our conditions (Fig. 6C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0006]). Optimization of these experimental conditions will allow for the most accurate estimation of protein abundance on each virus.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/db25e5e8-0705-4804-866a-45a1ee841e44/cpz1368-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",

(C) Stain index plot for the determination of the optimal staining concentration that provides minimal nonspecific binding. The stain index was calculated using the MFI in PE MESF of positively and negatively labeled virus populations divided by the SD of the negative population.",
    "To further increase the resolution of the dimly labeled virus population from background noise (Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0003]), the gain of the parameter being evaluated can be optimized directly on the instrument during acquisition. Similar to the adjustment of acquisition settings in classical flow cytometry for cell analysis, the gain can be optimized to increase the signal and the separation between the positively labeled population and background noise. As shown in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0007], we gradually increased the PE gain while keeping the threshold constant and evaluated where the stained viral population or reference beads fell in relation to the gain adjustments. By applying the formula for the calculation of stain index, we determined the optimal separation between our positive and negative populations (Fig. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0007]). Furthermore, by acquiring BD Quantibrite PE beads at the same gain setting, we were able to evaluate where the dimmest and brightest bead populations fell in relation to the gain adjustments. This allowed us to evaluate the dynamic range of detection with respect to our labeled viral population of interest (Fig. 7D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0007]). Although adjustments in PE gain increase the separation between background noise and the bead population, these can push the brightest bead population off scale and consequently affect the detection range in the PE channel. Once the gain is optimized, the fluorescence signal of the labeled virus can be compared to that of the reference bead population. In our case, this signal is closest to that of the dimmest bead population, as illustrated in Figure 7D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0007]. Once voltage has been optimized during the initial setup, reproducibility can be checked using the reference beads prior to each experiment to maintain optimal resolution.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3ca2885b-0fb4-4ada-a036-6c1facd3b170/cpz1368-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7",

Run buffer control (100-nm-filtered DBPS) on flow cytometer.\n3. While acquiring the buffer control, adjust instrument's gain configuration in order to increase or decrease the signal value.\nStart sample acquisition with the instrument's recommended settings or the settings used during instrument quality-control validation (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0002]).\n4. Systematically increase gain configuration.\nHere, we evaluated a range from 500 to 2000.\n5. Acquire buffer control (100-nm-filtered DBPS), stained viral sample of interest, and reference beads (BD Quantibrite PE beads) at each gain increment.",
    "The fluorescence intensity of labeled virus in MESF units can be compared to background and fluorescence reference beads to elucidate the dynamic range of detection with respect to the labeled viral population of interest (Fig. 7D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-fig-0007]).\n6. Gate on positively stained MLVsfGFP population and internal negative population (background noise or MLV in the case of a pre-mixed virus population, as used for Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0004], step 4) to obtain the MFI for each.\n7. Determine highest separation between the positive and negative populations using the formula for stain index determination (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.368#cpz1368-prot-0005], step 8).\nThe stain index is calculated as follows:\n         formula:\n\\begin{eqnarray*} Separation = \\frac{{MFI\\;of\\;postive\\;population\\; - \\;MFI\\;of\\;negative\\;population}}{{SD\\;of\\;negative\\;population}} \\end{eqnarray*}\nAlternatively, the threshold can be modified to enable the inclusion or exclusion of dimmer particles. However, adjusting the threshold could affect particle count and the ability to detect particles that fall within the background noise of the instrument if their signal does not exceed the newly adjusted threshold, or inversely, more background signals could be detected if the threshold is applied too low. For this purpose, the instrument sensitivity and dynamic range of the assay should be carefully evaluated."
