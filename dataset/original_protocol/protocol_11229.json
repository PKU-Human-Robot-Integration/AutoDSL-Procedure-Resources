    "NOTE: A schematic summary of this protocol is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Lentiviral vector library preparation\nNOTE: The demonstrated screen used an arrayed shRNA library purchased as glycerol stocks in 96-well plates, but libraries can also be assembled manually based on a list of candidates. Appropriate controls should be considered and included in any library. This includes a non-targeting control shRNA (shNTC), a control shRNA targeting the transcription factor being investigated, and if possible, an shRNA targeting firefly luciferase.\nAdd 1.3 mL of Luria Broth (LB) (1% bacto-trypton, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 100 µg/mL of ampicillin to each well of a 96-well deep well plate. Inoculate each well with 2 µL of glycerol stock and grow at 37 °C overnight with constant agitation at 225 rpm.\nTransfer each bacterial culture into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and pellet the bacteria by centrifugation at 21,000 x g at 4 °C for 10 min.\nPurify each vector using a bacterial mini-prep kit by following the manufacturer's protocol.\nDetermine the concentration of each vector using a spectrophotometer.\nStore the plasmids at -20 °C.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n2. Packaging of the arrayed lentiviral library\nNOTE: All work involving lentivirus, including packaging, infection, and subsequent culturing of infected cells should strictly follow the institutional biosafety rules and regulations.\nExpand the 293FT cells using complete growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 4 mM L-glutamine, 4,500 mg/L glucose and sodium pyruvate, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL of penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin antibiotic and 2 mM L-glutamine).\nFor each vector in the library from step 1.4, seed one 24-well with 1 x 105 293FT cells.",
    "NOTE: It is recommended that some extra wells of a control viral vector be packaged and used to test the titer of the virus prior to proceeding to step 3 (see below).\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: A general protocol for packaging lentivirus that was described previously14 has been scaled down to 24 wells for this protocol. It uses psPAX2 for lentiviral packaging and VSVG as a coat protein. If ectropic virus is desired, a vector delivering Eco can be used instead of VSVG. It is highly recommended that this protocol is optimized to achieve a viral titer that gives between 30%-70% infection efficiency of the target cells (see Discussion). See Supplemental Table 1 for a list of all vectors used.\nSet up a transfection mixture for each viral vector from Step 1.4 as described below. Each transfection should contain 250 ng of the viral vector, 125 ng of psPAX2, 125 ng of VSVG, 1.25 µL of transfection reagent 1, and 23.75 µL of transfection buffer (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nDilute each lentiviral vector to 50 ng/µL with nuclease-free water, and then transfer 5 µL (250 ng) into a well of a 96-well PCR plate.\nMake the transfection super mix by mixing 1.25 µL * X of transfection reagent 1 and 23.75 µL * X of pre-warmed transfection buffer where \"X\" is the total number of transfections plus several extra to account for volume loss during pipetting.\nIncubate the transfection super mix at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 125 ng * X of psPAX2 and 125 ng * X of VSVG to the tube of transfection super mix from Step 2.4.3 and gently pipet up and down to mix. Rapidly proceed to Step 2.4.5.",
    "Immediately aliquot the mixture from Step 2.4.4 into each tube of a PCR strip, and then use multi-channel pipette to transfer 25 µL the mixture into each well containing viral vector from Step 2.4.1.\nIncubate at room temperature for 20 min.\nTransfer all 30 µLs from each 96-well from Step 2.4.6 into a well of the 24-well containing 293 FT cells from Step 2.3.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h and then replace the media in every well of the 24-well plate with 500 µL of fresh complete growth media. Incubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for another 24 h.\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, collect the viral supernatant from each well and aliquot 220 µL (enough for 1 infection in Step 3 plus some extra volume) into two 96-wells each. These are the arrayed viral supernatant plates.\nStore the arrayed viral supernatant plates at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. It is also recommended to test some of the extra control virus that was packaged (see above) on the cells to be infected before proceeding to Step 3. This is to ensure that the titer is sufficient to achieve at least 30% infection efficiency.\n3. Infection of the cells for the screen\nNOTE: Human melanoma cells (A375) were used to demonstrate this approach, but this method can be applied to any adherent cells that infect with lentivirus. However, cell culture and plating conditions should be optimized for each cell line (see Discussion).\nExpand the cells to be infected in complete growth media.",
    "Seed 24-well plates with 1 x 105 cells in 0.5 ml of complete growth media per well. Seed one well for each viral vector to be tested (including controls) and include an extra well that will not be infected which will serve as a control for drug selection in Step 3.7.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nInfect each well from Step 3.2 with a different viral supernatant from the frozen arrayed lentiviral supernatant as follows.\n\t\nPrepare complete growth media that contains 20 µg/mL polybrene.\nThaw the arrayed lentiviral library supernatants from Step 2.7 to room temperature.\nAspirate the growth media from the 24-well plates from Step 3.2 and immediately add 200 µL of polybrene-containing growth media to each well.\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, transfer 200 µL of viral supernatant from each 96-well from Step 3.4.2 to the 24 wells from Step 3.4.3.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 - 48 h.\n\tNOTE: Some cell lines may require longer than 24 h to express the shRNAs and become puromycin resistant. The viral vector used here delivers a Turbo-GFP-IRES-puroR with a miR30-based shRNA in the 3'UTR of puroR (Figure 1). Infection efficiency and expression of the puromycin resistance gene and the shRNA were monitored by green fluorescent protein.\nPrepare complete growth media that contains 2.5 µg/mL puromycin.\n\tNOTE: The selection concentration of puromycin varies between cell lines. It is recommended that an antibiotic kill curve be performed for each cell line to be assayed prior to the screen.\nAspirate the media from each well and replace with 500 µL of puromycin-containing complete growth media.\n\tNOTE: Be sure to also add puromycin to a control non-infected well that can be used in subsequent steps to ensure the puromycin selection is complete.",
    "Incubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h.\n\tNOTE: It is best to select for 48 h, so plating density and viral titer should be optimized so that the cells are not overconfluent prior to 48 h.\nEnsure that the infected cells are green under the fluorescent microscope, and that cells on a control non-infected well treated with puromycin are all dead before proceeding to Step 4.\n4. Seeding cells for transfection of dual-luciferase reporter\nNOTE: A test transfection should be done to determine the optimal seeding density for each new cell line.\nTrypsinize each well from Step 3.9 and transfer roughly 1 x 105 cells into wells at the corresponding position on the new 24-well plate as follows.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is designed for the screening of libraries with hundreds of shRNAs so it is not feasible to count every well of infected cells. Therefore, the steps below were used to estimate cell numbers in each well to help ensure roughly equal plating density.\n\t\nGroup the wells from Step 3.9 into 3 - 4 groups such that all wells in a group have a similar cell density.\nTrypsinize 1 representative well from each group with 200 µL of trypsin-EDTA (1x PBS supplemented with 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.1% trypsin) for 5 min at 37 °C. Then neutralize the trypsin-EDTA by adding 400 µL of puromycin containing complete growth media.\nCount each representative well to determine the total cell number and dilute the cell suspension from each representative well to 2 x 105 cells/mL of using complete growth media.\nSeed 0.5 mL (1 x 105 cells) of each well from Step 4.1.3 into the corresponding position on a new 24-well plate and incubate this new 24-well plate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.",
    "For each group from Step 4.1.1, use the total cell number determined in Step 4.1.3 to calculate the volume of trypsin-EDTA to add to each well so that the resulting cell suspension will be 1 x 106 cells/mL.\nAdd the appropriate volume of trypsin-EDTA to each well and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: For larger screen it is recommended that the 24-well plates be trypsinized and replated in groups rather than all at once to ensure the viability of the cells.\nDuring the above incubation, use a multi-channel pipette to add 400 µL of puromycin-containing complete growth media to the corresponding wells on a new 24-well plate.\nTransfer 100 µL of cell suspension (approximately 1 x 105 cells) from each well to the corresponding position on the new 24-well plates prepared in Step 4.1.7.\nRepeat Steps 4.1.6 through 4.1.8 for all plates of grouped wells from Step 4.1.1, one plate at a time.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n5. Transfection of dual-luciferase reporter\nTransfect each well from Step 4.2 with the dual-luciferase reporter constructs as follows.\n\tNOTE: The total amount of DNA and the optimal ratio of firefly luciferase reporter vector to control Renilla luciferase vector should be determined prior to starting this assay. Here, 400 ng of a DNA mixture that contains 20 parts firefly luciferase reporter and 1 part control Renilla luciferase was used.\n\t\nMake the transfection dilution mixture (Tube A) and the reporter dilution mixture (Tube B) by mixing the indicated volumes of each reagent (Table 1) multiplied by the total number of transfections (plus several extra).\n\t\tNOTE: This protocol is optimized for transfection reagent 2 (see Table of Materials). If a different transfection reagent is used, the transfection should be optimized prior to this step.",
    "Mix the transfection dilution mixture (Tube A) with reporter dilution mixture (Tube B) and incubate at room temperature for 15 min to produce transfection mixture.\nDuring the above incubation, rinse each 24-well from Step 4.2 with 0.25 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and add 447 µL of complete growth media to each well.\nAfter the 15 min incubation, use a multi-channel pipette to distribute 53 µL of transfection mix to each well of the 24-well plates.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n6. Quantification of dual-luciferase activity\nMeasure luciferase activity using a plate reader and a dual-luciferase reporter assay kit as described below.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is optimized for the indicated reporter assay kit (see Table of Materials) and follows the manufacturer's recommended protocol.\n\t\nPrepare enough 1x passive lysis buffer for all wells plus several extra (75 µL is needed per well) by diluting 5x passive lysis buffer (provided in kit) 1 to 5 with deionized water. Also thaw reagent A and reagent B Buffer (provided in kit, 100 µL of each is needed for each well).\nAspirate the media from each well of the 24-well plate from Step 5.2.\nAdd 75 µL of 1x passive lysis buffer to each well and incubate at room temperature for 30 min with occasionally shaking.\nPrepare reagent B by diluting 50x reagent B substrate (provided in kit) 1:50 with thawed reagent B buffer.\nAdd 30 µL of 1x passive lysis buffer to 4 wells for blanking (see Supplemental Table 2).\nTransfer 30 µL of lysate from Step 6.1.3 into duplicate wells of a 96-well flat bottom white assay plate.\nUse a multi-channel pipette to add 50 µL of reagent A to each well and read the firefly luciferase signal with a plate reader.",
    "Use a multi-channel pipette to add 50 µL of reagent B from Step 6.1.4 to each well and read the Renilla luciferase signal with a plate reader.\nProcess the raw data as follows (for a detailed description, see Supplemental Table 2).\n\t\nExclude samples with very low Renilla luciferase signal as low values indicate that the viral construct was toxic or that too few transfected cells were assayed.\n\t\tNOTE: As explained in the Discussion, significantly \"low\" Renilla luciferase signal can result in anomalous results. Here, wells in which the Renilla luciferase signal was more than 1 standard deviation below the mean were excluded (see Supplemental Table 2). This was based on previous studies performed using this reporter system in these cells14, but may differ in other cell lines.\nNormalize the raw firefly luciferase value of each well to the raw Renilla luciferase value of the same well to obtain the firefly/Renilla ratio.\nAverage the firefly/Renilla ratios of all replicate control wells and then divide the firefly/Renilla ratio of every other well by that number to get a fold change.\nAssign the control sample and set its firefly/Renilla ratio value to 1.\nAverage the firefly/Renilla ratios of the duplicate wells and plot with the standard deviation.\n\t\tNOTE: The standard deviation is not used for statistical analysis, but instead as a means to identify wells where the replicates differ significantly.\nSubscription Required.
