    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPost-fixation of tissue sections\nTiming: 15–80 min\nBefore performing PIC experiments, prepare fresh-frozen sections or formalin-fixed frozen or paraffin sections at a thickness of 10 μm on MAS-coated glass slides. When using PFA and D-limonene, work in a fume hood.\nThe tissues are hydrated, washed, and fixed using PFA solution according to the following protocols for frozen (a) or paraffin (b) sections:\nCritical: The liquid volume of PBS or PFA dropped on the sections depends on the size of the hydrophobic barrier surrounded by PAP PEN. For a 1 × 1 cm hydrophobic barrier, a volume of 50 μL of fluid is optimal to fully cover the sections and prevent leakage from the barrier. The following protocols describe a 1 × 1 cm hydrophobic barrier. Use an aspirator with a fine needle to remove the liquid.\nFrozen sections (≈15 min).\nDrop and aspirate 50 μL of PBS onto the section twice to remove the OCT compound (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nDrop 50 μL of 4% PFA in PBS onto the section and incubate at RT for 10 min.\nAspirate the PFA solution and wash tissue sections twice with 50 μL of PBS.\nParaffin sections (≈80 min).\nImmerse the sections in a glass staining jar containing D-Limonene and incubate at RT for 5 min.\nRepeat step (i) two more times with a separate glass staining jar.\nImmerse sections in a glass staining jar containing ethanol (96%–100% [v/v]) and incubate at RT for 5 min.\nRepeat step (iii) two more times with a separate glass staining jar.\nImmerse the sections in a glass staining jar containing 90% ethanol and incubate at RT for 5 min.\nImmerse the sections in a glass staining jar containing 80% ethanol and incubate at RT for 5 min.",
    "Immerse the sections in a glass staining jar containing nuclease-free water and incubate at RT for 15 min.\nRemove glass slides from water, aspirate remaining water, and create a hydrophobic barrier around the section using PAP PEN.\nDrop 50 μL of PBS onto the sections.\nAspirate the PBS, drop 50 μL of 4% PFA in PBS onto the section and incubate at RT for 10 min.\nAspirate the PFA solution and wash the tissue sections twice with 50 μL of PBS.\nPermeabilization\nTiming: 35–75 min\nPermeabilization step is critical to enhancing the efficiency of in situ RT, as mentioned in “tissue preparation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]” of before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Subsequent steps are performed on a laboratory bench suitable for molecular biological experiments.\nPermeabilize sections with HCl (a) or TE (b) are as follows:\nHCl treatment (≈35 min).\nAspirate PBS from the sections, drop 25 μL of 5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS onto the section, and incubate at RT for 3 min.\nCritical: The drop of 25 μL of Triton X-100 is the optimal volume to prevent leakage from a 1 × 1 cm hydrophobic barrier.\nAspirate Triton X-100 in PBS, wash the tissue sections twice with 50 μL of PBS.\nAspirate PBS, drop 50 μL of 0.1 N HCl in nuclease-free water on the section, and incubate at RT for 5 min.\nAspirate the HCl solution, drop 50 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) onto the section, and incubate at RT for 5 min.\nAspirate the Tris solution, immerse the sections in preheated PBS at 65°C in a polypropylene staining jar and incubate in a hybridization oven for 5 min to extend the RNAs.\nImmerse the sections in a polypropylene staining jar containing ice-cold PBS for at least 3 min until the sections are fully cooled.",
    "Place a paper towel on the bottom of the humidified chamber and add 40 mL of PBS to balance the vapor pressure (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCritical: Do not humidify with nuclease-free water. The vapor of the water will be absorbed by the higher salt solution loaded onto the sections, causing leakage from the hydrophobic barriers during incubation.\nRemove the glass slides from the PBS, aspirate remaining PBS, and place the glass slides in the humidified chamber.\nWash the tissue sections twice with 50 μL of PBS.\nTE treatment (≈75 min).\nAspirate the PBS from sections, immerse the sections in TE buffer (pH 8.0) preheated to 70°C in a polypropylene staining jar and incubate in a hybridization oven for 1 h.\nImmerse the sections in a polypropylene staining jar containing chilled PBS for at least 3 min until the sections are fully cooled.\nPlace a paper towel on the bottom of the humidified chamber and add 40 mL of PBS to balance the vapor pressure.\nRemove the glass slides from the PBS, aspirate remaining PBS, and place the glass slides in the humidified chamber.\nWash the tissue sections twice with 50 μL of PBS (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nIn situ RT\nTiming: approximately 1 h\nmRNAs are reverse-transcribed in situ with NPOM-caged RT primers.\nPrepare the NPOM-caged RT primer mix, shown in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nCritical: NPOM is stable under indoor fluorescent light, but take care not to leave caged primers under the light for extended periods of time, unless required. By preparing RT primers with multiple barcodes, different samples can be pooled after cell lysis (step 26).",
    "After spinning down the sample tube (1,400 × g, RT, 2 s), incubate the tubes at 65°C in a preheated thermal cycler for 5 min to relax the secondary structure of the primers and immediately place the tubes on ice for at least 2 min.\nPrepare the first strand mix, as shown in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nMix 6 μL of NPOM-caged RT primer mix (step 4) and 4 μL of first strand mix (step 5) in a 0.2 mL 8-strip PCR tube by gentle pipetting.\nAdd 10 μL of the NPOM-caged RT primer and the first strand mix (step 6) onto the section and seal with a round coverslip (φ15 mm) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nCritical: Ensure there are no air bubbles present on the section. The size of the coverslip can be changed according to the size of the section, with an equivalent size being the best option.\nPlace the sections in a PBS humidified chamber, and incubate at 42°C for 1 h in a hybridization oven (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nDrop 300 μL of PBS onto the coverslip and remove the coverslips using tweezers (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nCritical: Be careful not to damage or peel tissue samples. The coverslips will float by dropping PBS onto the glass slides.\nImmerse sections in PBS preheated to 70°C in a polypropylene staining jar and incubate in a hybridization oven for 10 min to terminate RT reaction.\nImmerse the sections in a polypropylene staining jar containing chilled PBS for at least 3 min until the sections are fully cooled.\nPause point: Sections can be stored at 4°C for at least 3 days under light-shielded conditions.\nRemove the glass slides from PBS, aspirate the remaining PBS, and place the glass slides in a humidified chamber.\nWash the tissue sections twice with 50 μL of PBS.\n(Optional) Immunostaining",
    "Timing: 3.5–24 h\nImmunostaining is useful to visualize ROIs for subsequent photo-irradiation.\nCritical: Immunostaining protocols can largely depend on those recommended by antibody suppliers, but antigen retrieval by heating and proteinase treatment should be avoided. Overnight incubation at 4°C with primary antibodies is less harmful to the yield of sequence libraries. Secondary antibodies excited by blue (≈488 nm), green (≈555 nm), and far-red (≈633 nm) light can be used for immunolocalization, but those excited by shorter wavelengths (<425 nm) are not compatible with PIC because their excitation uncages the NPOM moieties of the RT primers.\nAspirate PBS from the sections, add 50 μL of blocking solution, and incubate at RT for 15 min in a humidified chamber.\nAspirate the blocking solution, drop 50 μL of primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution onto the section, and incubate at RT for 2 h in a humidified chamber.\nAspirate the primary antibody solution, wash the sections three times with 50 μL of TBST.\nDrop 50 μL of secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution onto the section and incubate at RT for 1 h in a humidified chamber.\nAspirate the secondary antibody solution and wash the sections three times with 50 μL of TBST.\n(Optional) Nuclear staining\nTiming: approximately 20 min\nNuclear Violet is useful to observe nuclei with 426–450 nm excitation light without uncaging NPOM moieties. Nuclear Violet is also excited by ∼365 nm UV, thus acting as a useful indicator of UV-irradiated cells.\nAspirate the TBST from the sections, add 50 μL of Nuclear Violet LCS1 (1:500) dissolved in blocking solution, and incubate at RT for 15 min in a humidified chamber.\nCritical: Nuclear staining can be performed simultaneously during incubation with the secondary antibody (step 17).",
    "Aspirate the nuclear staining solution and wash the sections three times with 50 μL of TBST.\nUV irradiation\nTiming: approximately 5 min\nNPOM moieties are uncaged by UV irradiation.\nAspirate the TBST from the sections and mount a round coverslip (φ15 mm) with 10 μL of SlowFade Diamond.\nCritical: Ensure that no air bubbles are present in the section. The size of the coverslip can be changed according to the size of the section, with an equivalent size being the best option.\nIrradiate 365 nm centered UV light onto the ROIs for 3–15 min with DMD.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1606-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Result of PIC RNA-seq\n(A) Screen shots during irradiation of the DG region of mouse hippocampal tissues are shown. Scale bars, 200 μm.

Quantification of libraries using BioAnalyzer\nThe library quantification data with BioAnalyzer is represented for PIC analysis of mouse hippocampus with or without photo-irradiation.",
    "Critical: We used a Leica DM6B fluorescence microscope equipped with Polygon1000-G DMD (Mightex) and UHP-F-365 LED (Prizmatix) for the photo-irradiation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). First, take a fluorescent image of the nuclear staining, with immunofluorescence as optional, using Leica Application Suite X (LAS-X) software, where the excitation wavelength must be longer than 425 nm to avoid uncaging of NPOM moieties. Next, overlay a PolyScan window, software to regulate the DMD, and outline the ROIs. Then, turn on the LED light to irradiate the ROI and obtain an image of the excited nuclei to record the illuminated area. When conducting the PIC experiment for the first time, it is recommended to also prepare a non-irradiated sample and to confirm that almost no product is obtained in the subsequent library synthesis (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), which is useful to check whether unexpected uncaging reactions are prevented.\nCell lysis\nTiming: approximately 40 min\nWhole cell lysates are collected in the test tubes.\nDrop 300 μL of PBS onto the coverslip and remove coverslips using tweezers (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nCritical: Be careful not to damage or peel tissue samples.
