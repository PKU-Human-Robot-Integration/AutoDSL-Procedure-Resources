    "The Animal Ethics Committee approved the experiment of Guangxi Medical University (No20190920). All animals were supplied by the Animal Experiment Center of Guangxi Medical University. We used SPF male Sprague Dawley rats (200-250 g, 10-12 weeks), kept under the room temperature of 25 ± 2°C and humidity of 50 ± 10%. Feeding was stopped 24 hours before operation; however, water was provided.\nNOTE: One operator can perform all operations without a microsurgery basis or surgical microscope.\n1. Operation\nAfter weighing, anesthetize the rats with isoflurane (5%) using an animal anesthesia machine.\nAfter 1-2 minutes, gently clamp the toes of the rat with tweezers. If the rat does not respond after pinching, it has entered a state of anesthesia. Use vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness. Use animal heating lamps to keep the rats' body temperature at 37-38 °C.\nFollowing abdominal disinfection (povidone iodine solution), fix the rat on the animal dissection table. Make a median incision of 3 cm below the xiphoid process using forceps and scissors.\nOpen the abdominal cavity, expose the liver using a retractor, and mobilize the hepatogastric ligament. Use cotton swabs to flip the middle lobe of the liver gently and turn it upward to expose the porta hepatis. Identify the CBD, PV, and HA.\nPush the small intestine toward the left lower abdominal cavity using cotton swabs, cover it with wet gauze, and move the intrahepatic vena cava to the right renal vein.\nIsolate the portal vein, hepatic artery, and the inferior vena cava above the right renal vein with an intraocular lens and forceps marked with 3-0 silk thread, each with a slip knot.",
    "Cut open the left and right lower extremity skin and expose the femoral vein using ophthalmic forceps. Slowly inject low molecular weight heparin 625 IU/kg through the femoral vein to heparinize the whole body.\nLigate the portal vein, hepatic artery, and inferior vena cava above the right renal vein with No. 3-0 sutures, lasting 45 minutes (Figure 1). Replace the small intestine in the abdominal cavity and cover it with gauze. Reduce inhalation anesthesia during these periods.\nAfter 45 minutes, release the portal vein, hepatic artery, and the inferior vena cava above the right renal vein.\nSuture the muscle and skin, layer by layer, and terminate the inhalational anesthesia. Provide postoperative analgesia using subcutaneous morphine of 5 mg/kg every 4 hours.\nObserve the rat until it is awake and feed under a temperature of 25 ± 2 °C and humidity of 50 ± 10%. Animal heating lamps are necessary.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
